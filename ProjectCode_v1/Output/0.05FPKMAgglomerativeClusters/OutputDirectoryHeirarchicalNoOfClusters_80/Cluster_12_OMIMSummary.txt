611442	TITLE *611442 DOUBLE HOMEOBOX PROTEIN 2; DUX2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The human genome contains hundreds of repeats of the 3.3-kb family in
regions associated with heterochromatin. The DUX gene family, including
DUX2, resides within these 3.3-kb repeated elements (Beckers et al.,
2001). See DUX4 (606009).

CLONING

Using PCR amplification of genomic DNA with primers from HEFT1, a
genomic sequence identified as a DNA-binding target of HLTF (SMARCA3;
603257), Ding et al. (1998) cloned DUX2. The deduced 80-amino acid
protein shares 70% amino acid identity with DUX1 (611441), but the DUX2
sequence stops just after the first homeodomain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ding et al. (1998) determined that the HEFT1 sequence, which presents a
consensus GC and TATAA box, and DUX1 sequences were not associated in
the genome; however, DUX2 was found carrying a promoter identical to
HEFT1.

MAPPING

By human-hamster somatic cell hybrid analysis, Ding et al. (1998)
determined that DUX2 sequences mapped to acrocentric chromosomes 13, 14,
15, 21, 22.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Vetter and Wurst (2001) cloned mouse Uqcc, which they called Bfzb, and
identified its human homolog by database analysis. The deduced human and
mouse proteins have a single transmembrane domain and share 94% amino
acid identity. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos detected Bfzb
predominantly in the developing nervous system, with highest expression
in proliferating neuroepithelia of brain and neural tube, ganglia of
cranial nerves V, VII, VIII, IX, and X, and dorsal root ganglia.
Transcripts were also detected in developing eye and brown fat. In adult
mouse brain, strong expression was restricted to olfactory bulb,
hippocampus, and piriform cortex and Purkinje cells of cerebellum. The
Bfzb protein localized to cytoplasmic vesicular structures.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the UQCC gene to chromosome 20q11.22 based on an
alignment of the UQCC sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK001712) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

120353	TITLE *120353 MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 1; MMP1
;;COLLAGENASE, FIBROBLAST; CLG; CLGN;;
COLLAGENASE, INTERSTITIAL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Matrix metalloproteinases are zinc-dependent proteases that degrade
extracellular matrix proteins. MMP1 is also known as collagenase (EC
3.4.23.7) (Nagase et al., 1992).

CLONING

Brinckerhoff et al. (1987) identified a cDNA clone of human collagenase.
The clone identified a single collagenase gene of about 17 kb from blots
of human genomic DNA. Restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequence data
indicated that the cDNA clone was full length and that it was identical
to that described for human skin fibroblast collagenase. Collagenase is
the only enzyme able to initiate breakdown of the interstitial
collagens, types I, II, and III. The fact that the collagens are the
most abundant proteins in the body means that collagenase plays a key
role in the remodeling that occurs constantly in both normal and
diseased conditions. The identity of human skin and synovial cell
collagenase and the ubiquity of this enzyme and of its substrates,
collagens I, II, and III, imply that the common mechanism controlling
collagenolysis throughout the body may be operative in both normal and
disease states.

MAPPING

Gerhard et al. (1987) confirmed the assignment of the collagenase gene
to chromosome 11 by the use of a DNA probe for Southern analysis of
somatic cell hybrids. Analysis of cell lines with rearrangements
involving chromosome 11 indicated that the gene is in the region
11q11-q23. Church et al. (1983) had used somatic cell hybrids between
mouse cells and human normal skin and corneal fibroblasts and recessive
dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB; 226600) skin fibroblasts to
assign the human structural gene for collagenase to chromosome 11.
Production of collagenase was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay.
It appeared that both the normal and the RDEB collagenase gene mapped to
chromosome 11. This was earlier taken to indicate that the abnormal
collagenase produced by RDEB cells represented a mutation of the
structural gene. Later work indicated that both the autosomal dominant
(131750) and autosomal recessive forms of dystrophic epidermolysis
bullosa are due to mutations in the type VII collagen gene (COL7A1;
120120). The excessive formation of collagenase must represent a
secondary phenomenon, not the primary defect. It should be noted that
fibroblasts from patients with the Werner syndrome (277700) also express
high constitutive levels of collagenase in vitro (Bauer et al., 1986).

Pendas et al. (1996) isolated a 1.5-Mb YAC clone mapping to 11q22.
Detailed analysis of this nonchimeric YAC clone ordered 7 MMP genes as
follows: cen--MMP8 (120355)--MMP10 (185260)--MMP1--MMP3 (185250)--MMP12
(601046)--MMP7 (178990)--MMP13 (600108)--tel.

GENE FUNCTION

Maymon et al. (2000) measured levels of MMP1 in amniotic fluid from 353
women, including those with intact membranes, in term or preterm labor
or not in labor, and those with term and premature rupture of the
membranes (610504), with or without microbial invasion of the amniotic
cavity. MMP1 was detectable in 81.3% (287 of 353) amniotic fluid
samples, and the concentration increased with increasing gestational
age. Analysis of the matrix metalloproteinase profile of amniotic fluid
in term and preterm rupture of membranes showed that patterns were
similar for every enzyme except MMP1 and MMP8 (120355), suggesting
different molecular pathophysiologic mechanisms for extracellular matrix
degradation of rupture of membranes in term and preterm gestations.
Maymon et al. (2000) concluded that MMP1 is implicated in the mechanisms
of membrane rupture.

Lahmann et al. (2001) found significantly more MMP1 mRNA in the buttock
skin of smokers than nonsmokers and suggested that smoking-induced MMP1
might be important in the skin-aging effects of tobacco smoking.

Saffarian et al. (2004) showed that activated collagenase (MMP1) moves
processively on the collagen fibril. The mechanism of movement is a
biased diffusion with the bias component dependent on the proteolysis of
its substrate, not ATP hydrolysis. Inactivation of the enzyme by a
single amino acid residue substitution in the active center eliminated
the bias without noticeable effect on rate of diffusion. Monte Carlo
simulations using a model similar to a 'burnt bridge' Brownian ratchet
accurately described the experimental result and previous observations
on kinetics of collagen digestion. Saffarian et al. (2004) concluded
that the biologic implications of MMP1 acting as a molecular ratchet
tethered to the cell surface suggested novel mechanisms for its role in
tissue remodeling and cell-matrix interaction.

Boire et al. (2005) found that expression of PAR1 (F2R; 187930) was both
required and sufficient to promote growth and invasion of breast
carcinoma cells in a xenograft mouse model. MMP1 acted as a protease
agonist of PAR1, cleaving the receptor at the proper site to generate
PAR1-dependent Ca(2+) signals and migration. MMP1 activity was derived
from fibroblasts and was absent from the breast cancer cells. These
results demonstrated that MMP1 in the stromal-tumor microenvironment can
alter the behavior of cancer cells through PAR1 to promote cell
migration and invasion.

By in vivo selection, transcriptomic analysis, functional verification,
and clinical validation, Minn et al. (2005) identified a set of genes
that marks and mediates breast cancer metastasis to the lungs. Some of
these genes serve dual functions, providing growth advantages both in
the primary tumor and in the lung microenvironment. Others contribute to
aggressive growth selectivity in the lung. Among the lung metastasis
signature genes identified, several, including MMP1 (p less than
0.000001), were functionally validated. Two that were not functionally
validated but that achieved the highest statistical significance (p less
than 0.000001) were FSCN1 (602689) and angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4;
605910). Those subjects expressing the lung metastasis signature had a
significantly poorer lung metastasis-free survival, but not bone
metastasis-free survival, compared to subjects without the signature.

Metastasis entails numerous biologic functions that collectively enable
cancerous cells from a primary site to disseminate and overtake distant
organs. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, Gupta et al. (2007)
showed that the epidermal growth factor receptor ligand epiregulin
(602061), the cyclooxygenase COX2 (600262), and the matrix
metalloproteinases MMP1 and MMP2 (120360), when expressed in human
breast cancer cells, collectively facilitate the assembly of new tumor
blood vessels, the release of tumor cells into the circulation, and the
breaching of lung capillaries by circulating tumor cells to seed
pulmonary metastasis. Gupta et al. (2007) concluded that their findings
revealed how aggressive primary tumorigenic functions can be
mechanistically coupled to greater lung metastatic potential, and how
such biologic activities can be therapeutically targeted with specific
drug combinations.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Joos et al. (2002) found an association between a 1-bp insertion in the
MMP1 gene (G-1607GG; dbSNP rs1799750; 120353.0001) and the rate of
decline of lung function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD;
606963).

Fujimoto et al. (2002) analyzed the G-1607GG promoter polymorphism in
the MMP1 gene in 75 African American infants who were born after preterm
premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM; 610504) and 235 controls, and
found a significant association between fetal carriage of a 2G allele
and PPROM (OR = 2.29; p = 0.028).

In studies in amnion fibroblasts, Wang et al. (2008) found that
inhibition of DNA methylation resulted in significantly increased MMP1
gene transcription and an associated significant increase in MMP1
production. These effects were correlated with reduced DNA methylation
at a specific site, -1538C, in the MMP1 promoter, and DNA methylation at
that site was reduced in a larger percentage of fetal membranes that
ruptured prematurely. The authors identified another SNP, 3447T-C
(numbering based on AF007878.1; dbSNP rs2075847), and observed that the
minor C allele was always methylated in vivo and that methylation
resulted in increased affinity for a nuclear protein in amnion
fibroblasts. Plasmid transfection studies and chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated reduced promoter activity of the
minor C allele. In a case-control study involving 284 African American
neonates from pregnancies complicated by PPROM and 361 African American
neonates from normal term pregnancies, Wang et al. (2008) found the
minor C allele to be protective against PPROM (OR = 0.7451; p = 0.0326),
consistent with its reduced promoter function. Neonates homozygous for
the major T allele had 3.51-higher risk for PPROM compared to CC
homozygotes (p = 0.007). Wang et al. (2008) concluded that, in addition
to genetic variation, DNA methylation plays a role in controlling MMP1
expression and risk of PPROM.

Titeux et al. (2008) demonstrated that the G-1607GG polymorphism in MMP1
results in transcriptional upregulation. They found a significant
association between this SNP and disease severity among patients with
autosomal recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB; 226600).

Rutter et al. (1998) identified a SNP (dbSNP rs1799750) in the promoter
region of the MMP1 gene (position -1607) where an additional guanine
nucleotide creates a binding site for members of the Ets family of
transcription factors. The 2G SNP displayed significantly higher
transcription in normal fibroblasts and in melanoma cells compared to
the 1G SNP. The occurrence of 2G homozygotes was 30% in 100 CEPH
controls; in tumor cell lines it was 62.5%. Rutter et al. (1998)
suggested that increased MMP1 expression contributes to stromal
degradation involved in tumor invasion.

Rate of Decline of Lung Function in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease

Joos et al. (2002) investigated the role of MMP polymorphisms (including
G-1607GG in MMP1 and N357S in MMP12) in the development of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (see 606963). The authors determined the
prevalence of these polymorphisms in 590 continuing smokers chosen from
the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Lung Health Study for
having the fastest (284 individuals) and slowest (306 individuals)
5-year rate of decline of lung function. Of 5 polymorphisms among 3 MMP
loci, only G-1607GG was associated with a rate of decline in lung
function. This allele was associated with a fast rate of decline (p =
0.02). However, haplotypes consisting of alleles from the G-1607GG and
N357S polymorphisms were associated with rate of decline of lung
function (p = 0.0007). Joos et al. (2002) concluded that polymorphisms
in the MMP1 and MMP12 genes, but not MMP9, are either causative factors
in smoking-related lung injury or are in linkage disequilibrium with
causative polymorphisms.

Preterm Premature Rupture of the Membranes

Fujimoto et al. (2002) studied the G-1607GG promoter polymorphism in
amnion-derived cells and found that the 2G promoter had more than 2-fold
greater activity than the 1G allele. Induction of MMP1 mRNA by phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was significantly greater in cells with a
1G/2G or 2G/2G genotype compared to cells homozygous for the 1G allele.
Analysis in 75 African American infants who were born after preterm
premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM; 610504) and 235 controls
demonstrated a significant association between fetal carriage of a 2G
allele and PPROM (OR = 2.29; p = 0.028). The authors concluded that the
2G allele has stronger promoter activity in amnion cells, that it
confers increased responsiveness of amnion cells to stimuli that induce
MMP1, and that this polymorphism contributes to the risk of PPROM.

Modifier of Epidermolysis Bullosa Dystrophica

Titeux et al. (2008) demonstrated that the G-1607GG polymorphism (dbSNP
rs1799750) in MMP1 results in transcriptional upregulation. The authors
found a significant association between this SNP and disease severity
among patients with autosomal recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa
(RDEB; 226600). In 3 affected sibs and a follow-up cohort of 31
unrelated French patients, the functional SNP resulting in increased
collagenase activity was associated with a more severe phenotype (p =
6.27 x 10(-5)). Titeux et al. (2008) concluded that increased MMP1 leads
to increased collagen degradation and worsening disease severity,
suggesting that MMP1 is a modifier gene in RDEB.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KLK8 belongs to the kallikrein subgroup of serine proteases, which have
diverse physiologic functions in many tissues. For background
information on kallikreins, see 147960.

CLONING

By searching an EST database, followed by PCR on hippocampus and
keratinocyte cDNA and RACE, Yoshida et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA
encoding KLK8, the human homolog of mouse neuropsin. The deduced
260-amino acid protein, 72% identical to the mouse sequence, has an
N-terminal signal peptide, conserved residues for protease activity, an
N-linked glycosylation site, and 13 cys residues. Northern blot analysis
detected a 0.9-kb transcript in keratinocytes.

Using a similar strategy, Mitsui et al. (1999) obtained cDNAs encoding
260- and 305-amino acid KLK8 isoforms, which they termed type-1 and
type-2 neuropsin, respectively. Sequence analysis determined that type 2
has a 45-residue leucine- and proline-rich insert at the C terminus of
the putative leader sequence of type 1. Mouse and human genomic sequence
analysis indicated that type 2 is a species-specific splice variant for
humans. Northern blot analysis revealed that type 1 is most intensely
expressed in pancreas, with lower expression in placenta, whereas type 2
is expressed in brain, suggesting organ-specific alternative splicing.
RT-PCR analysis detected type 2 expression in hippocampus. Dot blot
hybridization demonstrated expression of type 2 in all investigated
areas of the brain. Western blot analysis showed that type-1 and type-2
neuropsin are secreted as 35- and 38-kD proteins, respectively, from
insect cells.

By RT-PCR analysis using degenerate primers for serine proteases in
normal ovary and ovarian carcinoma, Underwood et al. (1999) identified a
cDNA encoding KLK8, which they called TADG14. Database searching showed
that TADG14 is identical to the 280-amino acid human neuropsin at the
protein but not the cDNA level. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.4-kb
transcript that was highly overexpressed in 20 of 30 ovarian carcinomas
studied. Western blot analysis detected a 30-kD protein in tumor cell
lines. Immunohistochemical analysis detected KLK8 in carcinoma but not
normal ovarian tissue. Underwood et al. (1999) suggested that
circulating KLK8 may be a useful marker for early detection of ovarian
carcinoma.

By RT-PCR of 35 adult and fetal tissues, Gan et al. (2000) detected
highest KLK8 expression in adult skin. Most other tissues showed weak
KLK8 expression.

Kishi et al. (2003) demonstrated K8 protein in ovarian cancer tissue
extracts, serum, and ascites fluid, suggesting that it may serve as a
new ovarian cancer marker.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Yoshida et al. (1998) determined that KLK8
is a single-copy gene that contains 6 exons and spans 5.4 kb. Promoter
analysis revealed atypical TATA and CCAAT box sequences.

GENE FUNCTION

Attwood et al. (2011) demonstrated in mice that the serine protease
neuropsin is critical for stress-related plasticity in the amygdala by
regulating the dynamics of the EphB2-NMDA receptor interaction, the
expression of Fkbp5 (602623), and anxiety-like behavior. Stress results
in neuropsin-dependent cleavage of EphB2 in the amygdala, causing
dissociation of EphB2 from the NR1 (138249) subunit of the NMDA receptor
and promoting membrane turnover of EphB2 receptors. Dynamic EphB2-NR1
interaction enhances NMDA receptor current, induces Fkpb5 gene
expression, and enhances behavioral signatures of anxiety. On stress,
neuropsin-deficient mice do not show EphB2 cleavage and its dissociation
from NR1, resulting in a static EphB2-NR1 interaction, attenuated
induction of the Fkbp5 gene, and low anxiety. The behavioral response to
stress can be restored by intraamygdala injection of neuropsin into
neuropsin-deficient mice and disrupted by the injection of either
anti-EphB2 antibodies or silencing the Fkbp5 gene in the amygdala of
wildtype mice. Attwood et al. (2011) concluded that their findings
established a novel neuronal pathway linking stress-induced proteolysis
of EphB2 in the amygdala to anxiety.

MAPPING

Harvey et al. (2000) mapped the KLK8 gene to chromosome 19q13.4 in the
KLK gene cluster between KLK7 (604438) and KLK9 (605504). They noted
that KLK5 (605643) to KLK14 are transcribed telomere to centromere.

EVOLUTION

Lu et al. (2007) demonstrated that type-2 KLK8 is absent from nonhuman
primates, indicating that it is human specific. In vitro splicing assays
revealed a human-specific mutation that triggers the change in splicing
pattern, and mutation assays showed that this mutation is necessary and
sufficient for type-2 KLK8 expression.

606158	TITLE *606158 BSCL2 GENE; BSCL2
;;SEIPIN;;
GNG3LG, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BSCL2, or seipin, is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein that
is induced in late stages of preadipocyte differentiation and is
predicted to function in lipid droplet formation and/or metabolism (Cui
et al., 2011).

CLONING

Within a 2.5-Mb critical region for Berardinelli-Seip congenital
lipodystrophy type 2 (BSCL2; 269700), Magre et al. (2001) identified a
gene that is homologous to the mouse 'gamma-3-linked gene' (Gng3lg).
Magre et al. (2001) found that the BSCL2 open reading frame encodes a
deduced 398-amino acid protein, seipin, with at least 2 hydrophobic
amino acid stretches, indicating that it could be a transmembrane
protein. It has 87% identity to the mouse Gng3lg product, and partial
homology to Drosophila CG9904 protein. Using Northern blot analysis,
Magre et al. (2001) observed highest expression in brain and testis.
Dot-blot analysis indicated that the BSCL2 gene is highly expressed in
most regions of the central nervous system. Magre et al. (2001)
identified a putative initiation codon located in the second exon.
Agarwal and Garg (2004) noted that an alternative upstream initiation
codon could extend the seipin protein by 64 amino acids at the putative
N terminus.

By Northern blot analysis, Windpassinger et al. (2004) detected a 1.8-kb
brain-specific transcript in all brain regions examined and a 2.2-kb
transcript in placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and
pancreas. Fluorescence microscopy showed seipin and calreticulin
(109091) colocalized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of transfected
human umbilical vein endothelial cells. They identified a conserved
N-glycosylation site at residues 88 to 90.

Lundin et al. (2006) found that the predominant form of seipin is 462
residues in length, and is generated by an initiation site upstream of
the site found originally.

By immunoblot analysis of mouse and human cells transfected with
full-length BSCL2, Ito and Suzuki (2007) detected full-length seipin as
a 74-kD band and N- and C-terminal fragments of seipin between 35 and 48
kD, suggesting that seipin is highly modified after translation. Seipin
immunoreactivity was present in anterior horns of mouse spinal cord and
clearly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Transiently expressed
human seipin appeared to be be proteolytically cleaved into an
N-terminal fragment, and full-length seipin was polyubiquitinated in
cultured neuronal and nonneuronal cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Ito et al. (2008) found expression of seipin in cortical neurons of
human frontal lobe and motor neurons of human spinal cord. Seipin
immunostaining was also observed specifically in mouse spermatids and
cells of the anterior lobe of the mouse pituitary gland. Cellular
studies in HeLa cells and mouse neuroblastoma cells indicated that
seipin has a glycosylated loop facing the ER lumen with both N and C
termini facing the cytosol. The first transmembrane domain is necessary
for ER retention. Neuronal and nonneuronal cells expressing the N88S
(606158.0013) and S90L (606158.0014) mutant proteins showed that both
mutant proteins localized correctly. Mutant cells also contained
inclusion bodies that were found to be distinct from aggresomes. The
second transmembrane domain was found to be critical for inclusion
formation, and both transmembrane domains were critical for activation
of the unfolded protein response (UPR). In a review of the function of
seipin and its role in disease, Ito and Suzuki (2009) noted that seipin
is an N-glycosylated protein that is proteolytically cleaved into N- and
C-terminal fragments and is polyubiquitinated.

GENE STRUCTURE

Magre et al. (2001) determined that the BSCL2 gene contains 11 exons
spanning at least 14 kb.

MAPPING

Magre et al. (2001) reported that the BSCL2 gene is homologous to the
mouse 'gamma-3-linked gene' (Gng3lg), which is localized in the region
of mouse chromosome 19 orthologous to human 11q. By positional cloning,
they located the BSCL2 gene within a 2.5-Mb critical region for a form
of Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Congenital Generalized Lipodystrophy type 2

In chromosome 11q13-linked families with congenital generalized
lipodystrophy type 2, and in 3 isolated patients, Magre et al. (2001)
identified mutations in the BSCL2 gene (606158.0001-606158.0012). Most
of the variants were null mutations predicted to result in the severe
disruption of the protein. Affected individuals were either homozygous
for a specific mutation or compound heterozygous; all parents of
unaffected sibs carried only 1 mutation. Magre et al. (2001) did not
find any mutation in affected individuals of the 9 families in which
BSCL is not linked to 11q13 or in 13 additional patients who had been
diagnosed with Lawrence syndrome (Lawrence, 1946), in which lipoatrophy
is not present at birth but develops at a later age.

Fu et al. (2004) screened for mutations in AGPAT2 (603100) and BSCL2 in
27 families with congenital generalized lipodystrophy. They found
mutations in either AGPAT2 or BSCL2 in all but 4 probands. Eighteen
patients with congenital generalized lipodystrophy from 15 families from
the same region of northeastern Brazil were homozygous for a frameshift
mutation in BSCL2 (669insA; 606158.0006). Despite having the same
mutation, the subjects had widely divergent clinical manifestations. Fu
et al. (2004) concluded that there did not appear to be any
distinguishing clinical characteristics between subjects with congenital
generalized lipodystrophy with AGPAT2 or BSCL2 mutations, with the
exception of mental retardation in carriers of BSCL2.

Szymanski et al. (2007) screened a yeast deletion library for aberrant
lipid droplets and found that absence of yeast seipin resulted in
irregular lipid droplets often clustered alongside proliferated ER;
giant lipid droplets were also seen. Electron microscopy showed abnormal
small irregular lipid droplets in fibroblasts from a BSCL2 patient with
a 5-bp deletion (606158.0005). In yeast, almost all lipid droplets
appeared to be on the ER, and seipin was found at these junctions. Human
seipin could functionally replace yeast seipin, but A212P
(606158.0009)-mutant human seipin that causes lipodystrophy could not.
Szymanski et al. (2007) hypothesized that seipin is important for lipid
droplet maintenance and perhaps assembly.

- Distal Hereditary Motor Neuropathy type VA and Silver Syndrome

In a large Austrian family with distal hereditary motor neuropathy type
VA (DSMAVA; 600794) reported by Auer-Grumbach et al. (2000),
Windpassinger et al. (2003) established linkage of the disorder to
11q12-q14, a chromosomal region overlapping that of Silver spastic
paraplegia syndrome (SPG17; 270685). Windpassinger et al. (2004)
confirmed linkage to the SPG17 locus in 16 additional families with a
phenotype characteristic of Silver syndrome. After refining the critical
region to 1 Mb, Windpassinger et al. (2004) sequenced the BSCL2 gene,
which lies within that region, and identified heterozygous mutations in
the family with DSMAV and those with SPG17. The mutations, asn88 to ser
(N88S; 606158.0013) and ser90 to leu (S90L; 606158.0014), affect
glycosylation of seipin and result in aggregate formation leading to
neurodegeneration. Windpassinger et al. (2004) noted that both DSMAV and
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D; 601472) had already been
associated with mutation in the GARS gene (600287), indicating genetic
heterogeneity. Their findings indicated that Silver syndrome and some
forms of dHMN are, in fact, extreme phenotypes resulting from mutations
in the same gene. Both conditions are genetically heterogeneous, as some
individuals with each phenotype did not carry a BSCL2 mutation.

By in vitro functional expression analysis, Ito and Suzuki (2007)
demonstrated that the N88S and S90L mutations in the BSCL2 gene disrupt
glycosylation of the seipin protein. Overexpressed mutant seipin was
highly ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome, and improper
glycosylation exacerbated endoplasmic reticulum retention. Mutant
proteins activated the unfolded protein response, resulting in apoptotic
cell death through ER stress. Ito and Suzuki (2007) concluded that the
N88S and S90L mutations, which result in motor neuron disease, have a
gain-of-function effect, resulting in conformational protein changes,
activation of the unfolded protein response, cell death, and
neurodegeneration.

ANIMAL MODEL

Cui et al. (2011) obtained seipin -/- mice at the expected mendelian
ratio. Seipin -/- mice were growth delayed, but they eventually achieved
normal weight. They showed significantly reduced adipose tissue mass,
including about 60% reduction in brown adipose tissue, glucose
intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and hepatic steatosis, with elevated
expression of select lipogenic genes. Levels of leptin (LEP; 164160) and
adiponectin (ADIPOQ; 605441) were significantly decreased in seipin -/-
mice, as were nonesterified fatty acids upon fasting.
Hypertriglyceridemia, which is common in human BSCL, was not observed in
seipin -/- mice.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, 2-BP DEL/3-BP INS, NT536

In 2 families with Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy (269700),
1 from eastern Norway and 1 from Italy, Magre et al. (2001) found
homozygosity for a mutation in exon 2 of the BSCL2 gene, the replacement
of 2 CC nucleotides at position 536 with 3 nucleotides (GGA), resulting
in a frameshift following phenylalanine-63 with a termination codon at
amino acid 75. They also found the mutation in heterozygous state in 2
affected families from southwestern Norway and the United Kingdom,
respectively. The phenotype presented at birth in the Norwegian and U.K.
families and before 9 months of age in the Italian family.

LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, 2-BP INS, 645AA

In a consanguineous Brazilian family with Berardinelli-Seip congenital
lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) found homozygosity for an
insertion of 2 adenines at nucleotide 645 of the BSCL2 gene, resulting
in a frameshift and premature termination at codon 111.

.0003
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, 2-BP DEL, 659GT

In a French family segregating Berardinelli-Seip congenital
lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) identified compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the BSCL2 gene: deletion of 2 basepairs
(GT) at nucleotide 659, resulting in frameshift and premature
termination at codon 112; and a 258-bp deletion/12-bp insertion in exons
5-6 (606158.0004).

.0005
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, 5-BP DEL, NT659

Magre et al. (2001) found that all Lebanese patients with
Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy (269700) whom they studied
were homozygous for a frameshift mutation resulting from the deletion of
GTATC at nucleotide 659 of the BSCL2 gene.

In fibroblasts from a BSCL2 patient with the 5-bp deletion, Szymanski et
al. (2007) found abnormal cytoplasmic lipid droplets.

.0006
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, 1-BP INS, 669A

In 2 South African Portuguese families with Berardinelli-Seip congenital
lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) found homozygosity for a
frameshift resulting from insertion of an adenine at nucleotide 669 of
the BSCL2 gene.

Bhayana et al. (2002) described the same mutation in a 10-year-old girl
from Canada whose parents were not known to be consanguineous, although
they came from the same region of Portugal. The family history was
positive for BSCL on both sides of the family. Her father had 2 affected
male cousins who were born to consanguineous parents and died in
childhood. Another affected female first cousin of the father died at 30
years of age with renal failure. An affected male, the second cousin of
the patient's mother, died at 28 years of age. In addition to having the
typical attributes of complete lipodystrophy, the patient had been
diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the first year of life. A
relationship between congenital lipodystrophy syndromes and cardiac
disorders is suggested by the fact that mutations in lamin A/C (LMNA;
150330) cause either lipodystrophy or cardiomyopathy.

Fu et al. (2004) found this mutation in 18 patients from 15 Caucasian
families from the same region of Serido county of Rio Grande do Norte
State in northeastern Brazil.

BSCL2, ARG138TER

In a French Portuguese family and 2 additional Portuguese families with
Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001)

from a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 756 of the BSCL2 gene.

.0008

BSCL2, IVS4, G-A, +1

In a consanguineous Turkish family segregating Berardinelli-Seip
congenital lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) identified a
G-to-A transition at the +1 position of intron 4, resulting in skipping
of exon 4.

.0009
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, ALA212PRO

In 4 southwestern Norwegian families segregating Berardinelli-Seip
congenital lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) identified a
G-to-C transversion at nucleotide 978 of the BSCL2 gene, resulting in an
alanine-to-proline substitution at codon 212. This mutation was found in
homozygosity in 3 of the families and in compound heterozygosity in 1.
The condition manifested at birth in these families.

.0010
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, 1-BP DEL, 980C

In a consanguineous Indian family segregating Berardinelli-Seip
congenital lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) identified
homozygosity for a mutation in the BSCL2 gene, the deletion of a C at
nucleotide 980 resulting in a frameshift at codon 213 and premature
termination at codon 232.

.0011
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, IVS6, G-A, +5

In a British family segregating Berardinelli-Seip congenital
lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) identified a G-to-A
transition at the +5 position of intron 6 of the BSCL2 gene, which
resulted in activation of a cryptic splice site leading to premature
termination at codon 225. The patient was compound heterozygous for this
mutation, and the condition manifested at birth.

.0012
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, IVS6, C-G, -3

In a Turkish French family segregating Berardinelli-Seip congenital
lipodystrophy (269700), Magre et al. (2001) identified homozygosity for
a C-to-G transversion at the -3 position of intron 6. This mutation
resulted in skipping of exon 7.

.0013
SILVER SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA SYNDROME
SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, DISTAL, TYPE VA, INCLUDED
BSCL2, ASN88SER

In affected members of 1 English and 4 Austrian families with Silver
spastic paraplegia syndrome (SPG27; 270685), Windpassinger et al. (2004)
identified heterozygosity for a 263A-G transition in the BSCL2 gene,
resulting in an asn88-to-ser (N88S) mutation. The English family was the
original one reported by Silver (1966). In affected members of 1
Italian, 1 English, and 8 Austrian families with distal spinal muscular
atrophy (HMN5A; 600794), they identified the N88S mutation.

Auer-Grumbach et al. (2005) reported the phenotypic findings in 90
patients from 1 large Austrian family and 2 unrelated German families
with the N88S mutation. There was considerable phenotypic variability,
including asymptomatic nonpenetrance (4.4%), subclinical involvement
(20%), distal spinal muscular atrophy characterized by prominent hand
muscle involvement (31.1%), Silver syndrome (14.5%) with hand muscle
involvement and spasticity, a Charcot-Marie-Tooth-like phenotype with
distal muscle weakness and wasting of the lower limbs and sensory
abnormalities (20%), and spastic paraparesis without hand involvement
(10%). Auer-Grumbach et al. (2005) concluded that the N88S mutation
causes a motor neuron disease affecting the upper motor neurons, lower
motor neurons, or both. Hand muscle involvement was a frequent, although
not regular, feature, and sensory involvement was usually not present.
Genealogic studies of the Austrian kindred traced the disease to a
common parent pair born in 1682.

Van de Warrenburg et al. (2006) reported 2 Dutch families with multiple
affected individuals carrying a heterozygous N88S mutation. The
phenotype in both families overlapped between Silver syndrome and HMN5.
Affected members in both families had foot and lower limb atrophy with
slowly progressive hyperreflexia and extensor plantar responses without
prominent spasticity. Hand involvement occurred in most patients and was
restricted to interosseus muscles.

Brusse et al. (2009) reported 12 members of a large 3-generation Dutch
family with phenotypic overlap between Silver syndrome and distal HMN5
who carried a heterozygous N88S mutation. The phenotype was variable,
and the distribution of muscle weakness and atrophy included
predominantly the feet (in 4), the hands (in 1), or both upper and lower
extremities (in 4). Three individuals showed evidence of pyramidal
features, including spasticity, hyperrflexia, and extensor plantar
responses. Severity of the disease ranged from adolescent patients with
disabling muscle weakness to an elderly patient with only mild weakness
of the ankle dorsiflexors and bilateral pes cavus. Brusse et al. (2009)
noted the extreme phenotypic variability associated with the N88S
mutation in their family and in those reported by Auer-Grumbach et al.
(2005) and van de Warrenburg et al. (2006), and suggested the presence
of other genetic or environmental factors. In their family, Brusse et
al. (2009) used genomewide linkage analysis to identify a candidate
disease modifier on chromosome 16p13.3-p13.12 between SNPs dbSNP
rs6500882 and dbSNP rs7192086 that was shared by all 12 affected
individuals (maximum lod score of 3.28). One family member without the
N88S mutation but with the chromosome 16p haplotype showed mild
electrophysiologic abnormalities. Brusse et al. (2009) postulated that a
locus on chromosome 16p may contain a disease modifier in their family.

Chaudhry et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous N88S mutation in a man
with SPG17. He had onset of weakness of the hands and feet at around 12
years of age. Examination at age 14 showed distal weakness and wasting
with clawed hands and flat feet, extensor plantar responses, mild
tremor, and distal sensory impairment. The disorder was slowly
progressive, and he remained ambulatory with orthotics at age 36. His
affected uncle also carried the mutation, as did his unaffected mother,
suggesting incomplete penetrance. The mutation was identified by exome
sequencing of the proband. The family was originally reported by
Ionasescu et al. (1991) as having an X-linked form of CMT (302802).

SILVER SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA SYNDROME
BSCL2, SER90LEU

In affected members of a Belgian family and a Brazilian family with
Silver spastic paraplegia syndrome (SPG17; 270685), Windpassinger et al.
(2004) identified heterozygosity for a 269C-T transition in the BSCL2
gene, resulting in a ser90-to-leu (S90L) mutation.

LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, ARG275TER

In 3 Japanese patients with Berardinelli-Seip congenital generalized
lipodystrophy (269700) from independent families, Ebihara et al. (2004)
identified a homozygous C-to-T transition in exon 8 of the BSCL2 gene
that resulted in premature termination of seipin at codon 275 (R275X).
Analysis of microsatellite markers and SNPs demonstrated common
ancestry. The authors stated that their study was the first report on
gene and phenotype analysis of congenital generalized lipodystrophy in
Japanese.

.0016
LIPODYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL GENERALIZED, TYPE 2
BSCL2, GLU189TER

In a Chinese infant with Berardinelli-Seip congenital generalized
lipodystrophy (269700), Friguls et al. (2009) identified a homozygous
565G-T transversion in exon 5 of the BSCL2 gene, resulting in a
glu189-to-ter (E189X) substitution. In addition to classic features of
the disorder, the patient had hypertension, an apical murmur, and severe
obstructive and asymmetric septal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The
authors emphasized the early onset of severe cardiac disease in this
patient.

Jin et al. (2007) had identified the E189X mutation in another Chinese
boy with congenital generalized lipodystrophy with early-onset diabetes
mellitus.

603360	TITLE *603360 PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS FACTOR 16; PEX16
;;PEROXIN 16
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Honsho et al. (1998) isolated a human PEX16 cDNA by performing an
expressed sequence tag (EST) homology search on a human DNA database and
by using yeast PEX16 from Yarrowia lipolytica to screen a human liver
cDNA library. This cDNA was found to encode a peroxisomal protein,
peroxin 16, that contains 336 amino acids. Among 13
peroxisome-deficiency complementation groups, PEX16 expression
morphologically and biochemically restored peroxisome biogenesis only in
fibroblasts from a case of Zellweger syndrome of the complementation
group referred to as CGD in Japan and CG9 in the United States. PEX16
was localized to peroxisomes through expression study of epitope-labeled
PEX16 protein.

South and Gould (1999) characterized wildtype PEX16 and found that it
has an apparent molecular mass of about 38 kD by SDS/PAGE. Sequence
analysis revealed 2 transmembrane domains, 1 spanning amino acids
110-144 and another spanning amino acids 222-243. Protease protection
experiments revealed a membrane orientation where the N- and C-termini
extend into the cytoplasm and the intermembrane loop is protected within
the peroxisome lumen.

GENE FUNCTION

South and Gould (1999) found that fibroblasts from the patient carrying
the R176X mutation (603360.0001) were unable to import PMP70 (170995)
into peroxisomes. Transfection and overexpression of wildtype PEX16 did
not induce peroxisome proliferation, but restored PMP70 import. The
authors concluded that PEX16-mediated formation of peroxisomes does not
require the division of preexisting peroxisomes. By characterizing
various truncation mutants, Honsho et al. (2002) determined that a
positively charged region (amino acids 66-81) and the first
transmembrane domain are required for peroxisome targeting of PEX16. The
C-terminal cytoplasmically exposed region of PEX16 functioned in
peroxisome formation. Transfection and overexpression of the R176X
mutation interfered with membrane protein transport.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In the study by Honsho et al. (1998), one patient with a peroxisomal
biogenesis disorder was found to have a homozygous nonsense mutation
(603360.0001) in the PEX16 gene.

In 6 patients, including 2 sibs, with a relatively mild form of
Zellweger syndrome characterized by early-childhood onset of progressive
spastic paraparesis and ataxia with progressive leukodystrophy and brain
atrophy on brain MRI, Ebberink et al. (2010) identified 5 different
homozygous mutations in the PEX16 gene (see, e.g.,
603360.0003-603360.0005). Studies of skin fibroblasts showed that
peroxisomes were markedly enlarged in size and reduced in number
compared to controls. However, biochemical studies showed only mild
abnormalities, such as increased very-long-chain fatty acids, and
increased bile acid intermediates or increased branched chain fatty
acids in some. Phytanic acid alpha-oxidation, pristanic acid
beta-oxidation, and red cell plasmalogen were normal. Peroxisomal
enzymes were normal, and the peroxisomes were import-competent.
Expression of wildtype PEX16 restored the number and size of peroxisomes
in patient fibroblasts to normal. Expression of mutant PEX16 in
PEX16-null cells resulted in enlarged peroxisomes in about 30% of cells,
indicating some residual activity. Ebberink et al. (2010) emphasized
that even though PEX16 is involved in peroxisomal membrane assembly,
PEX16 defects can present with a relatively mild phenotype showing
import-competent peroxisomes in fibroblasts.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 8A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX16, ARG176TER

In fibroblasts from a patient with Zellweger syndrome of complementation
group D (PBD8A; 614876), purchased from the NIGMS Human Genetic Mutant
Cell Repository (CCR GM06231), Honsho et al. (1998) demonstrated
deficiency of peroxin-16 and a nonsense mutation in the PEX16 gene: a
C-to-T transition at nucleotide 526, resulting in a change of codon 176
from CGA (arg) to TGA (stop).

.0002
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 8A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX16, IVSDS10, T-C, +2

Shimozawa et al. (2002) identified a homozygous splice site mutation
(IVS10+2T-C) in 2 complementation group D patients (PBD8A; 614876),
causing exon 10 deletion and changing the amino acid sequence starting
from codon 298, introducing a termination codon at position 336.

.0003
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 8B
PEX16, 1-BP DEL, 984G

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Turkish parents, with a peroxisomal
biogenesis disorder (PBD8B; 614877), Ebberink et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 1-bp deletion (984delG) in exon 11a of the PEX16 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature protein truncation. Exon 11b was
unaffected. Both patients presented between age 1 and 2 years with
delayed walking and frequent falls after normal initial development. The
disorder was progressive, characterized by lower limb spasticity and
ataxia resulting in wheelchair-dependence in the first decade. Studies
of skin fibroblasts showed that peroxisomes were markedly enlarged in
size and reduced in number compared to controls. However, biochemical
studies showed only mild abnormalities, such as increased
very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA), increased bile acid intermediates,
and increased branched chain fatty acids (only found in 1 sib).
Expression of wildtype PEX16 restored the number and size of peroxisomes
in patient fibroblasts to normal. Ebberink et al. (2010) emphasized that
even though PEX16 is involved in peroxisomal membrane assembly, PEX16
defects can present with a relatively mild phenotype showing
import-competent peroxisomes in fibroblasts.

.0004
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 8B
PEX16, TYR331CYS

In a girl with a relatively mild type of peroxisomal biogenesis disorder
(PBD8B; 614877), Ebberink et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 992A-G
transition in exon 11a of the PEX16 gene, resulting in a tyr331-to-cys
(Y331C) substitution. She developed an ataxic gait at age 2 years, after
normal initial development except for delayed walking. At age 6 years,
she had mild cognitive impairment, moderate dysarthria, and abnormal eye
saccades. Brain MRI showed widespread white matter changes on a
background pattern of global delay in myelin maturation, and reduced
cerebellar volume. Similar MRI findings were observed in her younger
sister. Studies of skin fibroblasts showed that peroxisomes were
markedly enlarged in size and reduced in number compared to controls.
However, biochemical studies showed only mild abnormalities, such as
increased VLCFA, but most other peroxisomal functions appeared normal.

.0005
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 8B
PEX16, DEL, EX11

In an Indian girl, born of consanguineous parents, with a relatively
mild type of peroxisomal biogenesis disorder (PBD8B; 614877), Ebberink
et al. (2010) identified a homozygous large intragenic deletion of
intron 10 and exon 11 of the PEX16 gene. In transcript variant 1, the
deletion affected the last 468 base pairs of intron 10, the entire exon
11a, and the first 80 base pairs of the 3-prime flanking region of exon
11a. In transcript variant 2, the deletion affected the last 603 base
pairs of intron 10, and the first 4 base pairs of exon 11b. The deletion
resulted in 3 alternative splice products. She showed normal development
for the first year of life, but then stopped acquiring new skills, and
lost her ability to walk independently at age 24 months due to
spasticity and mild ataxia. Her speech and other cognitive functions
also deteriorated slowly over time. At the age of 5 years, she had
nystagmus, cataracts, hyperreflexia, clonus, and extensor plantar
responses. Brain imaging showed diffuse white matter abnormalities and
focal atrophy of the cerebellum and corpus callosum. Peripheral nerve
velocity studies of the lower limbs suggested demyelination. Studies of
skin fibroblasts showed that the peroxisomes were markedly enlarged in
size and reduced in number compared to controls. However, biochemical
studies showed only mild abnormalities, such as increased VLCFA, but
most other peroxisomal functions appeared normal.

193065	TITLE *193065 VINCULIN; VCL
METAVINCULIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Vinculin is a cytoskeletal protein associated with the cytoplasmic face
of both cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adherens-type junctions,
where it is thought to function as one of several interacting proteins
involved in anchoring F-actin to the membrane (Weller et al., 1990).

CLONING

Weller et al. (1990) determined the complete sequence of the human
vinculin gene. They found that both human and chicken embryo sequences
of vinculin contain 1,066 amino acids and, furthermore, that the 2
proteins exhibit a high level of sequence identity (greater than 95%).
Southern blots of human genomic DNA hybridized with short vinculin cDNA
fragments indicated that there is a single vinculin gene.

Koteliansky et al. (1992) determined that metavinculin is the result of
alternative splicing of the VCL gene and contains an additional exon.
Across species, the deduced protein differs from vinculin in having an
additional insert of 68 to 79 amino acids in the C-terminal half of the
molecule. By comparison of metavinculin sequences from pig, man,
chicken, and frog, Strasser et al. (1993) found a division of the insert
into 2 parts: the first variable and the second highly conserved. The
longest insert, 79 amino acids, was found in Xenopus laevis. Three
different C-terminal constructs of vinculin and metavinculin
overexpressed in E. coli could be purified by column chromatography.
Using amino acid sequencing methods on the intact molecules and their
proteolytic subfragments, together with a polyclonal antibody specific
only for metavinculin from porcine stomach, Gimona et al. (1988)
identified and sequenced the insert in the porcine metavinculin
molecule. By alignment with the complete sequence of chick fibroblast
vinculin, they determined the exact location of the insert. In porcine
metavinculin, this insert lies between the 90-kD protease-resistant
N-terminal core and the C terminus of the molecule. It contains 68 amino
acids and is flanked by KWSSK sequences, one of which is present in
vinculin. The identity of the mapped vinculin and metavinculin sequences
outside this different peptide is consistent with 2 proteins arising via
alternative splicing at the mRNA level.

GENE STRUCTURE

Moiseyeva et al. (1993) determined that the VCL gene contains 22 exons
spanning greater than 75 kb. Alternative splicing of exon 19 results in
the cardiac- and smooth muscle-specific metavinculin isoform, containing
an additional 68 amino acids.

MAPPING

By use of a panel of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids, Weller et al.
(1990) mapped the VCL gene to chromosome 10q11.2-qter. By linkage
studies in a 3-generation family, Mulligan et al. (1992) mapped the VCL
gene to chromosome 10q22.1-q23, distal to D10S22. They confirmed the
assignment by hybridization of the vinculin cDNA to flow-sorted
translocation derivative chromosomes containing that portion of
chromosome 10.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Bakolitsa et al. (2004) described the crystal structure of the
full-length vinculin molecule (1,066 amino acids), which shows a
5-domain autoinhibited conformation in which the carboxy-terminal tail
domain is held pincer-like by the vinculin head, and ligand binding is
regulated both sterically and allosterically. Bakolitsa et al. (2004)
showed that the conformational changes in the head, tail, and
proline-rich domains are linked structurally and thermodynamically, and
proposed a combinatorial pathway to activation that ensures that
vinculin is activated only at sites of cell adhesion when 2 or more of
its binding partners are brought into apposition.

Using magnetic tweezers, total internal reflection fluorescence, and
atomic force microscopy, del Rio et al. (2009) investigated the effect
of force on the interaction between talin (186745), a protein that links
liganded membrane integrins to the cytoskeleton, and vinculin, a focal
adhesion protein that is activated by talin binding, leading to
reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Application of physiologically
relevant forces caused stretching of single talin rods that exposed
cryptic binding sites for vinculin. Thus in the talin-vinculin system,
molecular mechanotransduction can occur by protein binding after
exposure of buried binding sites in the talin-vinculin system.

GENE FUNCTION

Turner and Burridge (1989) reported experiments indicating that vinculin
is the major talin-binding protein in platelets. However, in addition, a
less abundant protein of approximately 150 kD also interacted strongly
with the talin fragment. Turner and Burridge (1989) confirmed that this
protein is metavinculin, a protein previously believed to be confined to
cardiac and smooth muscle tissue.

Hu et al. (2007) developed correlational fluorescent speckle microscopy
to measure the coupling of focal adhesion proteins to actin filaments
(see 102610). Different classes of focal adhesion structural and
regulatory molecules exhibited varying degrees of correlated motions
with actin filaments, indicating hierarchical transmission of actin
motion through focal adhesions. Interactions between vinculin, talin,
and actin filaments appear to constitute a slippage interface between
the cytoskeleton and integrins, generating a molecular clutch that is
regulated during the morphodynamic transitions of cell migration.

Using immunohistochemistry, Vasile et al. (2006) examined the pattern of
vinculin/metavinculin expression in the intercalated- and Z discs of
cardiomyocytes from patients with various cardiovascular conditions
associated with hypertrophy. Tissue specimens derived from patients with
obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH; see CMH15, 613255) and
aortic stenosis (see 109730) showed a universal defect of
vinculin/metavinculin expression in the intercalated disc but preserved
expression in the cardiac Z disc, whereas tissue specimens from patients
with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD; see CMD1W, 611407), hypertensive heart
disease (see 145500), or pulmonary hypertension (see 178600) exhibited
normal expression of vinculin/metavinculin in both the Z and the
intercalated disc, despite being associated with hypertrophy. Vasile et
al. (2006) suggested that differential expression of
vinculin/metavinculin in cardiac hypertrophy might depend on the
underlying pathophysiology, with localization unaffected by hemodynamic
overload but expression in the intercalated disc substantially reduced
by obstructive disease.

Kanchanawong et al. (2010) used 3-dimensional super-resolution
fluorescence microscopy to map nanoscale protein organization in focal
adhesions. Their results revealed that integrins and actin are
vertically separated by an approximately 40-nm focal adhesion core
region consisting of multiple protein-specific strata: a
membrane-apposed integrin signaling layer containing integrin
cytoplasmic tails (see 193210), focal adhesion kinase (600758), and
paxillin (602505); an intermediate force-transduction layer containing
talin and vinculin; and an uppermost actin-regulatory layer containing
zyxin (602002), vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (601703), and
alpha-actinin (102575). By localizing amino- and carboxy-terminally
tagged talins, Kanchanawong et al. (2010) revealed talin's polarized
orientation, indicative of a role in organizing the focal adhesion
strata. Kanchanawong et al. (2010) concluded that their composite
multilaminar protein architecture provided a molecular blueprint for
understanding focal adhesion functions.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Olson et al. (2002) used SSCP to analyze the vinculin gene in 350
unrelated patients with sporadic or familial dilated cardiomyopathy
(611407) who were negative for mutations in the ACTC (102540) and TPM1
(191010) genes, and identified heterozygosity for a 3-bp in-frame
deletion (L954del; 193065.0001) and a missense mutation (R975W;
193065.0002) in 2 patients, respectively. Neither mutation was found in
500 controls. A potential risk-conferring polymorphism, A934V, was
identified in heterozygosity in a 30-year-old man with dilated
cardiomyopathy who died 2 years after diagnosis of progressive heart
failure; this variant was also found in 1 of 500 controls, a 67-year-old
woman in whom electrocardiography showed abnormal T waves but
echocardiogram was nondiagnostic for dilated cardiomyopathy. All
variants were located in exon 19, the metavinculin-specific exon of the
vinculin gene. Low-shear viscometry studies revealed variable reductions
in viscosity associated with the mutations, with greater reductions
caused by the L954del and R975W mutants. Fluorescence microscopy
confirmed the viscosity findings, with actin organization by the A934V
variant similar to wildtype, although the network appeared coarser; more
prominent bundles were observed for L954del, and R975W showed the
highest bundling activity. Electron microscopy of cardiac myocytes from
a patient with the R975W mutation showed irregular and fragmented
intercalated discs, with intact sarcomeric thin and thick filaments.

Vasile et al. (2006) analyzed the metavinculin-specific exon 19 of the
VCL gene in 389 unrelated patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(CMH), who were negative for mutation in 8 known CMH-associated
sarcomere/myofilament-encoding genes, and identified heterozygosity for
the R975W mutation in a patient with CMH15 (613255).

In a cohort of 228 CMH patients who were negative for mutation in 12
known CMH-associated sarcomere/myofilament-encoding genes, Vasile et al.
(2006) performed comprehensive analysis of the 22 exons of the VCL gene
and identified a heterozygous mutation in 1 patient (L277M;
193065.0003). The authors noted that despite its ubiquitous expression,
the HCM-associated VCL mutation clinically yielded a cardiac-specific
phenotype.

ANIMAL MODEL

Xu et al. (1998) used a targeting vector to inactivate vinculin in
embryonic stem cells, which were then injected into mice. They found
that Vcl -/- embryos failed to develop beyond the tenth day of gestation
and at best were two-thirds of the normal size range. The most prominent
defect was lack of midline fusion of the rostral neural tube, producing
a cranial bilobular appearance and attenuation of cranial and spinal
nerve development. Heart development was curtailed at E9.5, with
severely reduced and akinetic myocardial and endocardial structures.
Somites and limbs were retarded, and ectodermal tissues were sparse and
fragile. Fibroblasts isolated from mutant embryos showed reduced
adhesion to fibronectin, vitronectin, laminin, and collagen compared to
wildtype. In addition, migration rates over these substrata were 2-fold
higher and the level of focal adhesion kinase (FAK; 600758) was 3-fold
higher. Xu et al. (1998) concluded that vinculin is necessary for normal
embryonic development, probably because of its role in the regulation of
cell adhesion and locomotion, although specific roles in neural and
cardiac development could not be ruled out.

Richards et al. (2005) analyzed hearts from Vcl +/- and wildtype mice
and found that although decreased vinculin expression enhanced
inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias, connexin-43 (GJA1; 121014)
content and distribution, and conduction velocities, were not
significantly different between mutant and wildtype mice. Richards et
al. (2005) suggested that other mechanisms, such as altered integrin
(see 192968) signaling, might contribute to arrhythmogenesis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1W
VCL, 3-BP DEL, 2862GTT

In a 39-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1W; 611407), Olson
et al. (2002) identified heterozygosity for a 3-bp deletion (2862delGTT)
in exon 19 of the vinculin gene, resulting in the in-frame deletion of a
leucine residue (leu954del). The patient's father died of heart failure
at 59 years of age, and a 70-year-old paternal uncle had heart failure,
but the patient's relatives declined clinical and genetic evaluation.
The mutation was not found in 500 unrelated controls.

CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1W
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 15
VCL, ARG975TRP

In a 57-year-old woman with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1W; 611407) who
had undergone cardiac transplantation, Olson et al. (2002) identified
heterozygosity for a 2923C-T transition in exon 19 of the vinculin gene,
resulting in an arg975-to-trp (R975W) substitution in the metavinculin
isoform. The mutation was also found in heterozygosity in 3 asymptomatic
relatives, 2 of whom were found to have disease on screening
echocardiogram: a 70-year-old maternal aunt had dilated cardiomyopathy,
and a 38-year-old daughter had mild left ventricular dilation. The
patient's 55-year-old sister carried the mutation but had normal left
ventricular dimensions and shortening/ejection fractions. The mutation
was not found in 500 unrelated controls.

In a 43-year-old woman with severe apical variant hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (CMH15; 613255), Vasile et al. (2006) identified
heterozygosity for the R975W substitution in the VCL gene, located in a
highly conserved residue in the tail region of metavinculin and
predicted to cause significant alterations in the secondary structure
and helical organization of the protein. The mutation was not found in
1,400 reference allele. Immunohistochemical analysis of the patient's
myocardium demonstrated a marked reduction of both vinculin and
metavinculin in the intercalated discs. Noting that the patient was
homozygous for wildtype vinculin and heterozygous for R975W
metavinculin, Vasile et al. (2006) suggested that the marked reduction
of proteins in the intercalated discs might be due to a
dominant-negative effect. However, after analyzing immunohistochemically
stained tissue specimens from patients with various cardiovascular
conditions associated with hypertrophy, Vasile et al. (2006) suggested
that differential expression of vinculin/metavinculin in cardiac
hypertrophy might depend on the underlying pathophysiology, with
localization unaffected by hemodynamic overload but expression in the
intercalated disc substantially reduced by obstructive disease (see GENE
FUNCTION).

.0003
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 15
VCL, LEU277MET

In a 76-year-old Caucasian woman with severely obstructive hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (CMH15; 613255), Vasile et al. (2006) identified a
heterozygous 829C-A transversion in exon 8 of the VCL gene, resulting in
a leu277-to-met (L277M) substitution at a conserved residue in a key
functional domain. The mutation was not detected in 400 reference
alleles. Immunostaining of myomectomy tissue from the patient showed
normal Z line staining but markedly reduced vinculin/metavinculin
staining in the intercalated discs.

607860	TITLE *607860 YY1 ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; YY1AP1
;;YY1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; YAP;;
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; HCCA2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display PCR of normal hepatic tissue and hepatocellular
carcinomas, followed by screening a placenta cDNA library, Wang et al.
(2001) cloned YY1AP1, which they called HCCA2. The deduced 467-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 50.65 kD. HCCA2 contains
2 SH3-binding domains, 2 N-glycosylation sites, 6 N-myristoylation
sites, and numerous phosphorylation sites, but it does not have a
transmembrane domain, signal peptide, or targeting sequences. Northern
blot analysis detected 1.8- and 2.5-kb transcripts in all adult tissues
examined except liver. Expression was also detected in fetal liver,
lung, brain, and spleen. Western blot analysis of transfected embryonic
kidney fibroblasts detected HCCA2 at an apparent molecular mass of about
50 kD. Immunohistochemical staining showed that HCCA2 protein was
localized in the cytoplasm of liver cancer tissues, and it was not found
in surrounding nontumor hepatocytes.

Kuryshev et al. (2006) determined that YY1AP1 was formed by fusion of
the 5-prime region of the ASH1L gene (607999) and the 3-prime region of
the GON4L gene (610393) during a tandem segmental duplication on
chromosome 1. YY1AP1 contains the partial promoter and untranslated
first exon of ASH1L and coding exons 13 to 21 of GON4L. The 3-prime
region of YY1AP1 originated from a long terminal repeat of an endogenous
retrovirus, known as the MER51A repeat, that was inserted into exon 21
of GON4L after the duplication. The deduced YY1AP1 protein contains 750
amino acids, 748 of which correspond to amino acids 590 to 1,337 of the
GON4L protein. The last 2 C-terminal residues of YY1AP1 come from the
long terminal repeat of MER51A. RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression of
YY1AP1, with highest levels in testis and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2001) determined that HCCA2 was not expressed in normal
adult liver tissue, but it was expressed in 79% of hepatocellular
carcinomas tested. HCCA2 expression was associated with invasion of the
tumor capsule.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kuryshev et al. (2006) mapped the YY1AP1
gene to chromosome 1q22.

607961	TITLE *607961 SEMAPHORIN 7A; SEMA7A
;;SEMAPHORIN L; SEMAL;;
SEMAPHORIN K1; SEMAK1;;
CDW108
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SEMA7A is an 80-kD membrane-bound semaphorin that associates with cell
surfaces via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage. It is
preferentially expressed on activated lymphocytes and erythrocytes.
SEMA7A carries the John Milton Hagen (JMH) blood group antigens (see
614745) (summary by Yamada et al., 1999).

CLONING

By PCR using primers designed from alcelaphine herpesvirus-1 (AHV) sema,
followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Lange et al. (1998) cloned
full-length SEMA7A, which they designated SEMAL, from a placenta cDNA
library. The deduced 666-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 75 kD, and the unglycosylated protein has a calculated
molecular mass of about 70 kD following signal peptide cleavage. SEMA7A
contains a 44-amino acid N-terminal signal sequence, a semaphorin domain
of about 500 amino acids, an immunoglobulin-like motif, and a C-terminal
hydrophobic domain that lacks a significant intracellular tail. The
semaphorin domain has several conserved cysteine residues and an RGD
motif. SEMA7A also contains 5 N-glycosylation sites and several
myristoylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.2-kb
transcript expressed predominantly in spleen, thymus, testis, and ovary.
Little or no expression was detected in prostate, small intestine,
colon, and peripheral blood leukocytes. RNA dot blot analysis detected
expression in placenta, spleen, and gonadal tissue, but not in neuronal
or muscular tissue.

By searching an EST database using AHV sema as probe, Xu et al. (1998)
identified SEMA7A, which they designated SEMAK1. SEMA7A shares about 50%
amino acid identity with AHV sema and less than 30% identity with other
semaphorins. Northern blot analysis of adult mouse tissues detected a
4.4-kb Sema7a transcript expressed at high levels in brain, spinal cord,
lung, and testis. In situ hybridization detected weak but dynamic
expression of Sema7a in spinal cord, cerebellum, and cortex during
embryonic development. In adult mice, Sema7a was expressed in several
brain structures and cell layers.

By PCR using primers based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of
SEMA7A, followed by screening a leukemic T-cell line cDNA library and a
placenta cDNA library, Yamada et al. (1999) cloned SEMA7A, which they
called CDW108. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.5-kb transcript
expressed at highest levels in placenta, testis, and spleen, with low
levels in brain and thymus. Yamada et al. (1999) detected 5
differentially glycosylated forms of SEMA7A by SDS-PAGE of a transfected
esophageal cancer cell line. The largest protein had an apparent
molecular mass of about 80 kD. Treatment with peptide-N-glycosidase
revealed a deglycosylated protein with an apparent molecular mass of
about 65 kD.

Sato and Takahashi (1998) cloned mouse Sema7a. They noted that the
immunoglobulin-like domain of the deduced 664-amino acid protein is of
the C2 type. Human and mouse SEMA7A share 89.5% identity. Northern blot
analysis of rat tissues detected highest expression in the nervous
system, and expression in the cerebellum and brain stem increased during
development. Moderate expression was detected in thymus and spleen.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lange et al. (1998) determined that the SEMA7A gene contains at least 13
exons and spans about 9 kb.

Seltsam et al. (2007) stated that the SEMA7A gene contains 14 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Lange et al. (1998) mapped the SEMA7A gene to chromosome
15q22.2-q23. Using radiation hybrid analysis, Yamada et al. (1999)
mapped the SEMA7A gene to chromosome 15q23-q24.

Lange et al. (1998) mapped the mouse Sema7a gene to chromosome 9A3.3-B.

GENE FUNCTION

Xu et al. (1998) demonstrated that SEMA7A is a GPI-anchored membrane
protein. SEMA7A was expressed on the cell surface of transfected COS-7
cells, and treatment with phospholipase C (see 600220) released the
protein from the cell surface. A soluble mutant of SEMA7A bound to
macrophage and mast cell lines, but it did not bind to COS-7 cells
expressing neuropilin-1 (602069) or neuropilin-2 (602070), receptors for
several secreted semaphorins. Xu et al. (1998) concluded that these
macrophage and mast cell lines contain a specific receptor for SEMA7A.

Pasterkamp et al. (2003) showed that semaphorin 7A, a membrane-anchored
member of the semaphorin family of guidance proteins known for its
immunomodulatory effects, can also mediate neuronal functions.
Pasterkamp et al. (2003) showed that unlike many other semaphorins,
which act as repulsive guidance cues, SEMA7A enhances central and
peripheral axon growth and is required for proper axon tract formation
during embryonic development. Unexpectedly, SEMA7A enhancement of axon
outgrowth requires integrin receptors and activation of MAPK signaling
pathways. Pasterkamp et al. (2003) concluded that their findings defined
a theretofore unknown biologic function for semaphorins, identified an
unexpected role for integrins and integrin-dependent intracellular
signaling in mediating semaphorin responses, and provided a framework
for understanding and interfering with SEMA7A function in both immune
and nervous systems. Pasterkamp et al. (2003) showed that
SEMA7A-mediated axon growth is plexin C1 (604259)-independent.

Suzuki et al. (2007) demonstrated that SEMA7A, which is expressed on
activated T cells, stimulates cytokine production in monocytes and
macrophages through alpha-1-beta-1 integrin (192968, 135630) (also known
as very late antigen-1) as a component of the immunologic synapse, and
is critical for the effector phase of the inflammatory immune response.
Sema7A-null mice are defective in cell-mediated immune responses such as
contact hypersensitivity and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
Although antigen-specific and cytokine-producing effector T cells could
develop and migrate into antigen-challenged sites in Sema7a-null mice,
Sema7a-null T cells failed to induce contact hypersensitivity even when
directly injected into the antigen-challenged sites. Thus, Suzuki et al.
(2007) concluded that the interaction between SEMA7A and alpha-1-beta-1
integrin is crucial at the site of inflammation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Association with Bone Mineral Density

Koh et al. (2006) genotyped 5 polymorphisms of the SEMA7A gene in 560
postmenopausal Korean women and measured bone mineral density (BMD; see
601884) of the lumbar spine and proximal femur. The SEMA7A polymorphisms
15775C-G (dbSNP rs2072649) and 22331A-G (dbSNP rs741761) were associated
with a low BMD of the femoral neck and lumbar spine (p = 0.02 and 0.04,
respectively) in a recessive model. A haplotype based on the 5 SNPs,
so-called ht4, was associated with risk of vertebral fracture (OR = 1.87
and 1.93, p = 0.03 and 0.02, in dominant and codominant models,
respectively). Koh et al. (2006) suggested that variations in SEMA7A may
play a role in decreased BMD and risk of vertebral fracture.

- John Milton Hagen Blood Group System: JMH-Variant Phenotype

In 5 unrelated individuals with JMH-variant phenotype (see 614745) from
5 different countries, Seltsam et al. (2007) identified 4 missense
mutations in the SEMA7A gene (607961.0001-607961.0004). These mutations
were not detected in genomic DNA from 100 randomly selected individuals
from Northern Germany. All 4 missense mutations occurred in the
semaphorin domain of SEMA7A.

ANIMAL MODEL

Czopik et al. (2006) found that T cells from immunized Sema7a -/- mice
had increased proliferative responses to antigen that were not
attributable to Sema7a deficiency on macrophages or dendritic cells.
Sema7a -/- mice were prone to die at the onset of experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and had higher clinical EAE scores
compared with wildtype littermates. Delayed-type hypersensitivity
responses were also enhanced in Sema7a -/- mice. Czopik et al. (2006)
concluded that SEMA7A plays an important T cell-intrinsic inhibitory
role and is essential in limiting T cell-mediated autoimmunity.

SEMA7A, ARG347LEU

In 4 young Native American women with JMH-negative phenotype (see
614745) from a reservation northwest of Quebec City, Canada, Richard et
al. (2011) identified a 1040G-T transversion in exon 9 of the SEMA7A
gene, resulting in an arg347-to-leu (R347L) substitution in the
semaphorin domain. At least 2 of the women were JHM-positive and their
alloantibody was compatible with most JHM-negative red blood cells
tested; the other 2 women were not tested. Soluble forms of wildtype and
R347L variant SEMA7A proteins were produced in vitro and demonstrated a
specific alloantibody reaction with wildtype recombinant SEMA7A, but not
with the R347L variant form.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chow and Lee (1996) reported the cDNA sequence of DENN, a novel human
gene that is differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cells
(hence, the symbol DENN). Northern blot analysis revealed differential
levels of expression of a 6.5-kb DENN transcript in malignant cell lines
compared to normal human tissues, where expression was highest in fetal
brain and kidney and in adult testis, ovary, brain, and heart. In fetal
liver and in several human cancer cell lines, the authors identified
cDNAs representing alternative transcripts of DENN that harbor a
deletion of 129 bp encoding 43 amino acids. Present within the serine-
and leucine-rich DENN gene product is an arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid
(RGD) cellular adhesion motif and a leucine zipper-like motif.

Using the yeast interaction trap system to identify proteins that
interact with the death domain of the type-1 tumor necrosis factor
receptor (TNFR1; 191190), Schievella et al. (1997) isolated cDNAs
encoding 'MAP kinase-activating death domain' (MADD) protein.
Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitated proteins from various human cell
lines detected an approximately 200-kD MADD protein. The deduced
1,588-amino acid MADD protein contains a C-terminal death domain.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) cloned KIAA0358. The deduced protein
contains 1,581 amino acids and is nearly identical to DENN.

Chow et al. (1998) stated that the DENN and MADD cDNAs and proteins are
virtually identical. From genomic studies, they traced the alternative
splicing of a 129-bp fragment to an alternative 5-prime donor site
involving exon 7. The deduced longer DENN isoform has 1,587 amino acids.
Western blot analysis of human MOLT-4 T-lymphoblastic leukemic cell
proteins detected a doublet consisting of 138- and 142-kD polypeptides.
The authors found the DENN protein concentrated predominantly in the
cytosolic compartment of MOLT-4 cells but was restricted to the nuclear
compartment of PLC/PRF/5 hepatoma cells.

Efimova et al. (2004) identified 7 putative splice variants of MADD:
IG20 full-length (IG20FL), IG20, KIAA0358, MADD (also referred to as
DENN), IG20 short variant-2 (IG20SV2), DENNSV (also referred to as
IG20SV3), and IG20SV4. These variants arise from alternative splicing of
exons 13L, 16, 21, 26, and 34. IG20FL, the longest variant, is encoded
by all 36 exons of the MADD gene. RT-PCR detected variable expression of
IG20, MADD, IG20SV, and DENNSV in all human tissues examined. Expression
of KIAA0358, IG20FL, and IG20SV4 was not observed.

GENE FUNCTION

Schievella et al. (1997) found that the MADD protein associated with
TNFR1 through a death domain-death domain interaction. Overexpression of
MADD activated the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK2 (176948),
and expression of the MADD death domain stimulated both the ERK2 and
JNK1 (601158) MAP kinases and induced the phosphorylation of cytosolic
phospholipase A2 (600522). The authors suggested that MADD links TNFR1
with MAP kinase activation and arachidonic acid release.

Al-Zoubi et al. (2001) showed that HeLa cells permanently transfected
with IG20 or DENNSV were more susceptible or resistant to TNF-alpha
(TNFA; 191160)-induced apoptosis, respectively. All MADD variants tested
could interact with TNFR1 and activate ERK and NF-kappa-B (see 164011).
However, relative to control cells, only those expressing IG20 showed
enhanced TNF-alpha-induced activation of caspase-8 (CASP8; 601763) and
CASP3 (600636). Cowpox virus CrmA, an inhibitor of caspase-induced
apoptosis, inhibited apoptosis when transfected in IG20-expressing HeLa
cells.

Using specific small hairpin RNAs targeted to splice variants of the
MADD gene, Mulherkar et al. (2006) found that knockdown of the MADD
variant resulted in spontaneous apoptosis in HeLa cells and in a human
ovarian carcinoma cell line, and they demonstrated that the MADD variant
alone was necessary and sufficient for cancer cell survival. Mulherkar
et al. (2006) hypothesized that since the MADD variant can bind to death
receptors, it may prevent apoptotic signaling by interfering with death
receptor oligomerization.

Efimova et al. (2004) found that overexpression of DENNSV enhanced cell
replication and resistance to treatment with proapoptotic stimuli. In
contrast, IG20 expression suppressed cell replication and increased
susceptibility to proapoptotic stimuli. Moreover, cells that were
resistant or susceptible to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis exclusively
expressed endogenous DENNSV and IG20, respectively. Transfection of IG20
in a DENNSV-expressing cell line overrode endogenous DENNSV function and
increased susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli. Dominant-negative
I-kappa-B (see NFKBIA; 164008) reversed the effects of DENNSV, but not
IG20, indicating that DENNSV functions through NF-kappa-B activation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chow et al. (1998) determined that the MADD gene spans at least 28 kb
and contains 15 exons, ranging in size from 73 to 1,230 bp.

Efimova et al. (2004) determined that the MADD gene contains 36 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the MADD gene
to chromosome 11. Using FISH, Chow et al. (1998) mapped the MADD gene to
chromosome 11p11.2.

;;T2R3
DESCRIPTION See also TAS2R10 (604791).

Adler et al. (2000) identified members of a family of 40 to 80 human and
rodent G protein-coupled receptors expressed in subsets of taste
receptor cells of the tongue and palate epithelia. These candidate taste
receptors, which the authors called T2Rs, are organized in the genome in
clusters and are genetically linked to loci that influence bitter
perception in mice and humans. Each T2R gene encodes a 7-transmembrane
receptor protein. The amino acid sequence identities between human and
mouse T2Rs range from 46 to 67%. The authors determined that a single
taste receptor cell expresses a large repertoire of T2Rs, suggesting
that each cell may be capable of recognizing multiple tastants. In situ
hybridization demonstrated that T2Rs are exclusively expressed in taste
receptor cells that contain the G protein subunit gustducin, implying
that they function as gustducin-linked receptors. Adler et al. (2000)
identified T2R3 in a PAC clone from 7q31.3-q32.

Kinnamon (2000) reviewed the role of taste receptors in taste
transduction.

;;SMALL EDRK-RICH FACTOR 1; SERF1;;
SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY-RELATED GENE H4F5; H4F5;;
SMA MODIFIER 1; SMAM1
DESCRIPTION Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has been classified into 3 types based on
age of onset and severity. SMA I-III all map to 5q13, and nearly all
patients display deletions or gene conversions of the SMN1 gene
(600354). Although some correlation has been established between SMN
protein levels and disease course, the genetic basis for SMA phenotypic
variability is mainly unexplained, and it had been postulated that the
loss of an additional modifying factor contributes to the severity of
type I SMA. Scharf et al. (1998) found that a multicopy microsatellite
marker deleted in more than 90% of type I SMA chromosomes was embedded
in an intron of H4F5, indicating that this gene is also highly deleted
in type I SMA chromosomes, and thus is a candidate phenotypic modifier
for SMA. The microsatellite marker, designated C212, is located in the
last intron of H4F5, 5 kb upstream of H4F5 exon 3b and 13 kb upstream of
SMN exon 1. In 58 type I SMA patients of varied European and Arabian
descent, Scharf et al. (1998) found a reduction or absence of C212/H4F5
alleles in 94% of chromosomes, implying a deletion of 1 or both copies
of the marker and therefore of H4F5 exon 3b in these individuals. In
comparison with the high rate of C212/H4F5 deletions in type I SMA, the
C212 deletion frequency in type II SMA chromosomes was between that of
type I and control chromosomes, whereas deletions in type III
chromosomes were only slightly more frequent than in controls.

Scharf et al. (1998) sequenced a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
containing the mouse Smn gene to identify conserved elements between the
human SMA interval and its previously identified syntenic region on
mouse chromosome 13 (Scharf et al., 1996). The resulting sequence was
filtered for repetitive elements and used to screen the EST database.
ESTs corresponding to SMN and NAIP were identified as well as 2 ESTs
representing novel genes within the BAC. One of these ESTs, clone
368449, mapped to 10.6 kb upstream of mouse Smn; subsequent analysis of
surrounding genomic sequences using 4 exon-prediction programs
identified no additional transcripts between 368449 and Smn or between
Smn and Naip. The full-length 566-bp mouse 368449 cDNA and its human
ortholog were cloned from a mouse brain and human skeletal muscle cDNA
library, respectively. The human clone was 99% homologous to exon 4F5,
an exon previously trapped from an SMA cosmid known to contain SMN exon
1. The full-length human cDNA was named H4F5, and its mouse counterpart
M4f5, until an appropriate function can be assigned to the 2 genes. The
proteins displayed 97% amino acid similarity to one another and both
genes were ubiquitously expressed with highest RNA levels in testis. In
addition, H4F5 has a larger 1.8-kb isoform, H4F5L, with a predicted
110-amino acid open reading frame that results from alternative splicing
of exon 3. In contrast to the 0.6-kb mouse and 0.7-kb human 4F5S
isoforms, the 1.8-kb H4F5L transcript is predominantly expressed in
heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. Both isoforms are also expressed
throughout the central nervous system, including spinal cord, which is
the tissue primarily affected in SMA. H4F5 was found to lie closer to
SMN1 than any previously identified gene in the region.

VAMP-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 33-KD; VAP33
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNAREs (see 603215) are compartmentally specific, cytoplasmically
oriented integral membrane proteins involved in the fusion of membranes
and the transport of intracellular proteins. Recognition of vesicles and
target membranes is mediated by v-SNAREs (e.g., VAMP8; 603177) and
t-SNAREs (e.g., SNAP23; 602534), respectively.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for human homologs of the Aplysia 33-kD
VAMP-associated protein (Vap33), Weir et al. (1998) identified a cDNA
encoding VAPA, which they termed VAP33. Sequence analysis predicted that
the 242-amino acid protein, which is 50% identical to the molluscan
sequence, contains 8 potential phosphorylation sites, an alpha-helical
coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal transmembrane domain. Northern blot
analysis of mouse tissues detected a major 1.9-kb transcript and minor
3.9- and 7.1-kb transcripts in all tissues tested, with highest
expression in brain, testis, ovary, kidney and skeletal muscle. In
contrast, Vap33 expression is neuron specific in Aplysia.

Nishimura et al. (1999) identified cDNAs encoding VAPA and the 60%
homologous VAPB (605704). Northern blot analysis detected a 1.7-kb VAPA
transcript in all human tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

By Western blot analysis, Weir et al. (1998) showed that VAPA interacts
with VAMP1 (185880) and VAMP2 (185881) but not with SNAP25 (600322).

By SDS-PAGE analysis, Nishimura et al. (1999) demonstrated that the
transmembrane domain of recombinant VAPA interacted with VAPA and VAPB
fusion proteins.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the VAPA
gene to chromosome 18 (TMAP stSG49693).

T-CELL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR; TCGFR;;

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The action of the T-cell growth factor interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680)
requires the presence of a cell surface receptor. As most peripheral as
well as thymic T cells do not carry the receptor in vivo, the regulated
expression of IL2R appears to be a safeguard against a catastrophic
spread of T-cell proliferation by an immunogenic stimulus. The receptor
is a heterodimer, consisting of 1 alpha and 1 beta chain; the beta chain
(146710) was not characterized until 1989. The receptor molecule, a
glycoprotein, has a relative mass of about 55,000. Its intracellular
precursor is smaller. Leonard et al. (1983) used a monoclonal antibody
for T-cell growth factor to characterize the receptor.

Leonard et al. (1984), Nikaido et al. (1984), and Cosman et al. (1984)
cloned the IL2R gene. Leonard et al. (1984) identified 1 gene but 2 IL2R
mRNAs that differ in their polyadenylation signals. They also isolated
an additional cDNA that may correspond to an alternatively spliced mRNA
that lacks a 216-bp segment and appears to encode an altered membrane
protein that cannot bind interleukin-2. Nikaido et al. (1984) determined
the primary structure of the precursor, which has 272 amino acid
residues.

Hatakeyama et al. (1985) provided evidence that the IL2 receptor is
generated, at least in part, by a single gene, namely, the gene encoding
Tac antigen (p55). Hatakeyama et al. (1986) used site-directed mutation
in the Tac antigen cDNA to generate a mutant receptor. Results of
expression studies led them to propose that a molecule that is
associated with but distinct from the Tac antigen is involved in the
regulation of the functional IL2R complex. Tsudo et al. (1986) arrived
at a similar conclusion on the basis of other studies.

Robb et al. (1988) employed further cytomutagenesis studies of the Tac
molecule to derive a correlation between the structure and function of
various components of the molecule. The Tac antigen represents the alpha
chain of IL2R, which binds IL2 with low affinity (Leonard et al., 1984;
Nikaido et al., 1984), whereas the beta chain by itself does not bind
IL2 when expressed in COS-7 cells. However, coexpression of the 2 chains
leads to the formation of a high-affinity receptor. The same situation
exists with the alpha and beta chains of the GM-CSF receptor (CSF2RA;
306250).

GENE STRUCTURE

Leonard et al. (1985) reported that the IL2R gene has 8 exons spanning
more than 25 kb. Ferrari et al. (1987) determined that exons 2 and 4 are
derived from a gene duplication event and also are homologous to the
recognition domain of factor B of the complement system (CFB; 138470).

MAPPING

Leonard et al. (1985) mapped the IL2R gene to 10p15-p14. Ferrari et al.
(1987) confirmed the assignment of IL2R to chromosome 10 by studies of
DNA from a rodent-human hybrid panel. By in situ hybridization, Webb et
al. (1990) assigned the Il-2ra gene to band A2-A3 of mouse chromosome 2.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Rickert et al. (2005) presented the 2.8-angstrom crystal structure of a
complex between human IL2 (147680) and IL2RA, which interact in a
docking mode distinct from that of other cytokine receptor complexes.
IL2RA is composed of strand-swapped 'sushi-like' domains, unlike the
classical cytokine receptor fold. As a result of this domain swap, IL2RA
uses a composite surface to dock into a groove on IL2 that also serves
as a binding site for antagonist drugs.

Wang et al. (2005) reported the crystal structure of the quaternary
complex of IL2 with IL2RA, IL2RB, and IL2RG at a resolution of 2.3
angstroms.

GENE FUNCTION

Lamaze et al. (2001) selectively blocked clathrin (see 118960)-dependent
endocytosis using dominant-negative mutants of EPS15 (600051) and showed
that clathrin-mediated endocytosis of transferrin (190000) was
inhibited, while endocytosis of the IL2Rs proceeded normally.
Ultrastructural and biochemical experiments showed that
clathrin-independent endocytosis of IL2Rs exists constitutively in
lymphocytes and is coupled to their association with detergent-resistant
membrane domains. The authors found that clathrin-independent
endocytosis requires dynamin (see 602377) and is specifically regulated
by Rho family GTPases (see 604980). These results defined novel
properties of receptor-mediated endocytosis and established that IL2R is
efficiently internalized through this clathrin-independent pathway.

Ihle and Kerr (1995) reviewed the activation cascade involving
cytokines, IL2RA and other cytokine receptors, the Janus kinases (see
JAK1; 147795), and the signal transducers and activators of
transcription, or STATs (see STAT1; 600555).

In a commentary, Shevach (2001) noted that the transfer into
immunocompromised mice of CD4 (186940)-positive T cells from which a
subpopulation coexpressing CD25 had been removed induced organ-specific
autoimmune disease in most recipients (Ansano et al., 1996). The
CD4-positive/CD25-positive population was solely responsible for the
prevention of this autoimmunity. Shevach (2001) cited a number of
publications that had confirmed the importance of these cells in the
regulation of immune responses in human models. All the studies appeared
to show that the suppression involves a cell contact-dependent,
cytokine-independent mechanism after activation of the
CD4-positive/CD25-positive T cells.

Due to similarities between the autoimmunity and inflammation produced
by manipulation of CD25-positive/CD4-positive regulatory T (Tr) cells
and those induced by genetic defects in the FOXP3 gene (300292), Hori et
al. (2003) investigated the contribution of Foxp3 to the development
and/or function of Tr cells in mice. RT-PCR analysis of normal mice
showed stable, constitutive expression of Foxp3 that was high in Tr
cells, low in CD4-positive/CD25-negative cells, and absent in
CD4-negative/CD8-positive T cells. Transduced expression of Foxp3 in
CD4-positive/CD25-negative cells imparted a Tr phenotype in these cells,
with low levels of cytokine expression, compared with nontransduced or
vector-only transduced cells, and high levels of CD103 (604682), GITR
(TNFRSF18; 603905), and CTLA4 (123890). Transduced cells also showed
cell-cell contact suppressive activity in vitro, as well as suppression
of autoimmunity and inflammation in vivo. Hori et al. (2003) proposed
that FOXP3 may be a master regulatory gene and a more specific marker of
Tr cells than other cell surface molecules. They also suggested that
FOXP3 transduction could be a therapeutic mode for the treatment of
inflammatory diseases.

Pasare and Medzhitov (2003) found that microbial induction of dendritic
cell (DC) maturation by activation of Toll-like receptors (e.g., TLR4;
603030) abrogated the suppressive effects of CD25-positive/CD4-positive
Tr cells. The blockade of Tr cell-mediated suppression was independent
of costimulatory molecule expression on DCs. Stimulation of the
TLR/MYD88 (602170) pathway in DCs led to the expression of IL6 (147620)
and, most likely, other secreted factors that do not signal through the
common gamma chain (IL2RG; 308380), and these mediated the block of
suppression. Il6-deficient mice were severely compromised in the
induction of effector T-cell responses, and this defect could be
transiently overcome by depletion of Tr cells. Pasare and Medzhitov
(2003) concluded that the failure of Il6-deficient mice to overcome
Tr-mediated suppression resulted in increased susceptibility to
infection and resistance to autoimmunity. In a commentary, Powrie and
Maloy (2003) proposed a model for the control of Tr development by
innate immune cells and noted that the targeting of IL6 may be an
attractive treatment for inflammatory diseases.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Sharfe et al. (1997) identified a 4-bp deletion in the CD25 gene,
resulting in a frameshift in protein translation (147730.0001), in a
patient with IL2RA deficiency (606367).

By using a haplotype tag SNP approach, Vella et al. (2005) tested type 1
diabetes (222100) sample collections consisting of 7,457 cases and
controls and of 725 multiplex families. Tag SNPs were analyzed using a
multilocus test to provide a regional test for association. They found
strong statistical evidence in the case-control collection for a type 1
diabetes locus in the CD25 region of chromosome 10p15 (see IDDM10;
601942) and replicated the association in the family collection. Vella
et al. (2005) recognized that association might not be with CD25 itself,
but rather with a causal variant in linkage disequilibrium with CD25.

In an analysis of up to 5,312 individuals with type 1 diabetes and 6,855
controls, Lowe et al. (2007) localized the type 1 diabetes association
in the IL2RA gene region to 2 independent groups of SNPs, spanning
overlapping regions of 14 and 40 kb, encompassing IL2RA intron 1 and the
5-prime regions of IL2RA and flanking gene RBM17 (606935) (odds ratio =
2.04; P = 10(-28)). IL2RA type 1 diabetes susceptibility genotypes were
associated with lower circulating levels of soluble IL2RA (p = 6.28 x
10(-28)), suggesting that an inherited lower immune responsiveness
predisposes to type 1 diabetes.

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the IL2RA
gene and multiple sclerosis, see MS2 (612594).

IL2RA, 4-BP DEL, NT60

In a patient with severe immunodeficiency (606367), who was subsequently
treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, Sharfe et al.
(1997) found homozygosity for a 4-bp deletion in the IL2RA gene at
nucleotides 60 to 64, resulting in a translational frameshift.
Translation proceeded for 20 amino acids before the deletion and
resultant frameshift occurred, effectively ablating CD25 expression. A
further 25 irrelevant amino acids were added before termination. The
homozygous nature of the mutation was confirmed by analysis of sequences
from the parents, who both demonstrated a normal and a 4-bp-deleted
allele.

IL2RA, C-A (dbSNP rs41295061)

In an analysis of 5,312 individuals with type 1 diabetes (IDDM10;
601942) and 6,855 controls, Lowe et al. (2007) found that a SNP in the
IL2RA gene, dbSNP ss52580101, was the most associated SNP in a 40-kb
region encompassing IL2RA intron 1 and the 5-prime regions of IL2RA and
RBM17 (606935) (P = 3.37 x 10(-20)). The submitted SNP dbSNP ss52580101
has been assigned the refSNP identifier dbSNP rs41295061.

.0003
DIABETES MELLITUS, INSULIN-DEPENDENT, 10
IL2RA, T-A (dbSNP rs11594656)

Lowe et al. (2007) found by logistic regression analysis that a SNP in
intron 1 of IL2RA, dbSNP rs11594656, added significantly to the effect
of dbSNP ss52580101 (147730.0002) on susceptibility to type 1 diabetes
(IDDM10; 601942) (P = 8.19 x 10(-7)). Determination of soluble IL2RA
concentration (sIL2RA) for 1,357 case plasma samples found significant
association of dbSNP rs11594656 with sIL2RA (P = 2.15 x 10(-23)). The
presence of 2 copies of the susceptibility allele (T) was associated
with lower concentrations of sIL2RA compared with the presence of 1 or
more copies of the protective allele (A).

;;INTEGRIN, BETA-4, BINDING PROTEIN OF; ITGB4BP;;

EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 3A; EIF3A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The integrin beta-4 subunit (ITGB4; 147557) is highly enriched in
hemidesmosomes, specialized structures providing firm mechanical links
between basal lamina and the intermediate filament cytoskeleton. A
303-amino acid segment of the ITGB4 cytoplasmic domain that encompasses
the first 2 N-terminal fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains and their
interconnecting sequence is necessary for mediating ITGB4 signaling
events and incorporation into hemidesmosomes. Using a yeast 2-hybrid
system to identify polypeptides that interact with this functional
region of the ITGB4 cytodomain, Biffo et al. (1997) isolated human
epithelial cell cDNAs encoding ITGB4-binding protein (ITGB4BP), which
they called p27BBP. Southern blot analysis showed that the human genome
contains a single copy of the ITGB4BP gene. Northern blot analysis and
in situ hybridization detected Itgb4bp mRNA in all mouse tissues
examined, with the highest levels mainly in proliferating epithelia and
in epithelial tissues containing Itgb4. The predicted human ITGB4BP
protein has 245 amino acids and lacks a signal sequence. Western blot
analysis using antibodies against ITGB4BP detected a 27-kD protein in
epithelial cell lysates, which is in agreement with the calculated
molecular mass of ITGB4BP. Both in yeast and in vitro, ITGB4BP
specifically bound to the first 2 FNIII domains of ITGB4. ITGB4BP is an
insoluble protein that is present in the nucleus and cytoplasm. It is
associated with the intermediate filament pool and is localized at the
submembrane level in close apposition with ITGB4. The authors suggested
that ITGB4BP links ITGB4 to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton.

Eukaryotic translation initiation factor-6 (EIF6) binds to the 60S
ribosomal subunit and prevents its association with the 40S ribosomal
subunit. Using antibodies against purified rabbit EIF6 protein to
immunoscreen a HeLa cell cDNA expression library, Si et al. (1997)
isolated a cDNA encoding EIF6. Northern blot analysis detected an
approximately 1.1-kb transcript in all human tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Ceci et al. (2003) demonstrated that the ribosomal 60S subunit is
activated by release of EIF6. In the cytoplasm, EIF6 is bound to free
60S but not to 80S subunits. Furthermore, EIF6 interacts in the
cytoplasm with RACK1 (176981), a receptor for activated protein kinase C
(PKC; see 176960). RACK1 is a major component of translating ribosomes,
which harbor significant amounts of PKC. Loading 60S subunits with EIF6
caused a dose-dependent translational block and impairment of 80S
formation, which were reversed by expression of RACK1 and stimulation of
PKC in vivo and in vitro. PKC stimulation led to EIF6 phosphorylation,
and mutation of a serine residue in the carboxy terminus of EIF6
impaired RACK1/PKC-mediated translational rescue. Ceci et al. (2003)
proposed that EIF6 release regulates subunit joining, and that RACK1
provides a physical and functional link between PKC signaling and
ribosome activation.

To elucidate how microRNAs mediate their repressive effects, Chendrimada
et al. (2007) performed biochemical and functional assays to identify
new factors in the microRNA pathway. Chendrimada et al. (2007) showed
that human RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) associated with a
multiprotein complex containing MOV10 (610742), the homolog of
Drosophila translational repressor Armitage, and proteins of the 60S
ribosome subunit. Notably, this complex contains the antiassociation
factor EIF6, a ribosome inhibitory protein known to prevent productive
assembly of the 80S ribosome. Depletion of EIF6 in human cells
specifically abrogated miRNA-mediated regulation of target protein and
mRNA levels. Similarly, depletion of EIF6 in C. elegans diminished Lin4
microRNA-mediated repression of the endogenous Lin14 and Lin28 (611043)
target protein and mRNA levels. Chendrimada et al. (2007) concluded that
their results uncovered an evolutionarily conserved function of the
ribosome antiassociation factor EIF6 in microRNA-mediated
posttranscriptional silencing.

Gandin et al. (2008) demonstrated that mammalian eIF6 is required for
efficient initiation of translation in vivo. Eif6-null mouse embryos
were lethal at preimplantation. Heterozygous mice had 50% reduction of
eIF6 levels in all tissues, and showed reduced mass of hepatic and
adipose tissues due to a lower number of cells and to impaired G1/S cell
cycle progression. eIF6 heterozygous cells retained sufficient nucleolar
eIF6 and normal ribosome biogenesis. The liver of eIF6 heterozygous mice
displayed an increase of 80S in polysomal profiles, indicating a defect
in initiation of translation. Consistently, isolated hepatocytes had
impaired insulin-stimulated translation. Heterozygous mouse embryonic
fibroblasts recapitulated the organism phenotype and had normal ribosome
biogenesis, reduced insulin-stimulated translation, and delayed G1/S
phase progression. Furthermore, eIf6 heterozygous cells were resistant
to oncogene-induced transformation. Thus, Gandin et al. (2008) concluded
that eIF6 is the first eIF associated with the large 60S subunit that
regulates translation in response to extracellular signals.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Sanvito et al. (1998) mapped the
ITGB4BP gene to 20q11.2.

;;PURINOCEPTOR P2Y2; P2Y2; P2Y2R;;
P2U NUCLEOTIDE RECEPTOR; P2UR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Parr et al. (1994) reported the sequence and functional expression of a
cDNA cloned from human airway epithelial cells that encodes P2RY2, a
protein with properties of a P2U nucleotide receptor. They also isolated
an identical cDNA from human colonic epithelial cells, indicating that
this is the same P2U receptor that had been functionally identified in
other human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

The chloride ion secretory pathway that is defective in cystic fibrosis
(219700) can be bypassed by an alternative pathway for chloride ion
transport that is activated by extracellular nucleotides. Accordingly,
the P2 receptor that mediates this effect is a therapeutic target for
improving chloride secretion in CF patients. Using a retrovirus system,
Parr et al. (1994) stably expressed a human airway P2RY2 clone in 1321N1
astrocytoma cells, a human cell line unresponsive to extracellular
nucleotides. Studies of inositol phosphate accumulation and
intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization induced by extracellular nucleotides
in 1321N1 cells expressing the receptor identified this clone as the
target receptor in human airway epithelia. Expression of P2RY2 in 1321N1
cells revealed evidence for autocrine ATP release and stimulation of
transduced receptors. Thus, P2RY2 expression in the cell line was
proposed as a useful system for studying autocrine regulatory mechanisms
and for screening potential therapeutic drugs.

Katzur et al. (1999) reported that in single endometrial carcinoma
HEC-1A and Ishikawa cells, ATP induced a rapid and extracellular
Ca(2+)-independent rise in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration in a
dose-dependent manner, with an ED50 of about 10 microg. This
ligand-selective profile indicated the expression of the P2RY2 subtype
in endometrial cells. Accordingly, RT-PCR using P2RY2 primers amplified
the expected transcript from both cell lines. The coupling of these
receptors to phospholipase C was confirmed. The authors concluded that
P2RY2 may participate in control of the cell cycle of endometrial
carcinoma cells.

Tai et al. (2000) studied the expression and regulation of the P2UR gene
in human granulosa-luteal cells (GLCs) by RT-PCR and Northern blot
analysis. Expression of P2UR mRNA was downregulated by human chorionic
gonadotropin (CG) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Treatment with
8-bromo-cAMP and forskolin also attenuated P2UR mRNA levels. The authors
concluded that the P2UR mRNA is expressed in human GLCs and that P2UR
mRNA is regulated by human CG, cAMP, and forskolin. These findings
further supported a potential role of this neurotransmitter receptor in
the human ovary.

Adrian et al. (2000) analyzed the expression of several purinergic
receptors during differentiation in a promyelocytic leukemia cell line.
Granulocytic differentiation was induced by dimethylsulfoxide, and a
monocytic/macrophage phenotype was induced by phorbol esters. Basal
expression of P2Y2 was relatively high in undifferentiated cells, and
expression declined during granulocytic differentiation. P2Y2 expression
also decreased during monocytic differentiation and was nearly
undetectable after 48 hours.

Arthur et al. (2005) found that activation of P2ry2 by ATP-gamma-S, a
nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, in the presence of NGF (162030) led to
colocalization and association of Trka (NTRK1; 191315) and P2ry2 and was
required for enhanced neuronal differentiation in a rat neuronal
precursor cell line. Depletion of P2ry2 by genetic means or by small
interfering RNA abolished the ATP-gamma-S-mediated increase in neuronal
differentiation. Moreover, in vivo injection of ATP-gamma-S into the
sciatic nerve of wildtype mice, but not P2ry2-null mice, increased
expression of Gap43 (162060), a marker for axonal growth. Arthur et al.
(2005) concluded that P2RY2 is a morphogen receptor that potentiates
neurotrophin signaling in neuronal development and regeneration.

Chen et al. (2006) found that human neutrophils release ATP from the
leading edge of the cell surface to amplify chemotactic signals and
direct cell orientation by feedback through the P2Y2 nucleotide
receptors. Neutrophils rapidly hydrolyze released ATP to adenosine that
then acts via A3-type adenosine receptors, which are recruited to the
leading edge to promote cell migration. Thus, Chen et al. (2006) found
that ATP release and autocrine feedback through P2Y2 and A3 receptors
provide signal amplification, controlling gradient sensing and migration
of neutrophils.

Through several lines of evidence, Elliott et al. (2009) identified
extracellular nucleotides as a critical apoptotic cell 'find-me' signal.
Elliott et al. (2009) demonstrated the caspase (see 147678)-dependent
release of ATP and UTP in equimolar quantities during the early stages
of apoptosis by primary thymocytes and cell lines. Purified nucleotides
at these concentrations were sufficient to induce monocyte recruitment
comparable to that of apoptotic cell supernatants. Enzymatic removal of
ATP and UTP (by apyrase or the expression of ectopic CD39, 601752)
abrogated the ability of apoptotic cell supernatants to recruit
monocytes in vitro and in vivo. Elliott et al. (2009) then identified
the ATP/UTP receptor P2Y2 as a critical sensor of nucleotides released
by apoptotic cells using RNA interference-mediated depletion studies in
monocytes, and macrophages from P2Y2-null mice. The relevance of
nucleotides in apoptotic cell clearance in vivo was revealed by 2
approaches. First, in a murine air-pouch model, apoptotic cell
supernatants induced a 3-fold greater recruitment of monocytes and
macrophages than supernatants from healthy cells did; this recruitment
was abolished by depletion of nucleotides and was significantly
decreased in P2Y2-null mice. Second, clearance of apoptotic thymocytes
was significantly impaired by either depletion of nucleotides or
interference with P2Y receptor function (by pharmacologic inhibition or
in P2Y2-null mice). Elliott et al. (2009) concluded that their results
identified nucleotides as a critical find-me cue released by apoptotic
cells to promote P2Y2-dependent recruitment of phagocytes, and provided
evidence for a clear relationship between a find-me signal and efficient
corpse clearance in vivo.

MAPPING

Using PCR analysis of human-rodent hybrid cell line DNAs, Dasari et al.
(1996) mapped the human P2RY2 gene to chromosome 11q13.5-q14.1. The
authors noted that several G protein-coupled receptor genes, namely the
beta adrenergic receptor, the angiotensin receptor-like-1, and the
muscarinic cholinergic receptor-1, have been localized to the same
region of chromosome 11. By sequence tagged site (STS) mapping using the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, Somers et
al. (1997) demonstrated that the P2RY2 gene maps within less than 4 cM
of the P2RY6 gene (602451), which they had mapped to 11q13.5 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization and STS mapping. This was the first
chromosomal clustering of this gene family to be described.

613125	TITLE *613125 NUCLEAR RECEPTOR-INTERACTING PROTEIN 3; NRIP3
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FUNCTION

Using microarray and RT-PCR analyses, Zhong et al. (2007) found that the
NRIP3 gene was downregulated in all 9 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
cell lines examined compared with normal controls. Semiquantitative
RT-PCR showed downregulation of NRIP3 in 4 of 8 lung tumor samples
compared with adjacent normal tissue. The promoter region of NRIP3 was
highly methylated in 1 NSCLC cell line and partially methylated in 4
others, and treatment of several NSCLC cell lines with a combination of
DNA methylation and histone deacetylase inhibitors restored NRIP3
expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhong et al. (2007) determined that the promoter region of the NRIP3
gene contains a CpG island.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhong et al. (2007) mapped the NRIP3 gene
to chromosome 11p15.3.

601002	TITLE *601002 GLUTATHIONE SYNTHETASE; GSS
;;GSHS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glutathione (GSH), a ubiquitous low molecular mass thiol, is important
for a variety of biologic functions, including protection of cells from
oxidative damage by free radicals, detoxification of xenobiotics, and
membrane transport (Meister and Anderson, 1983; Uhlig and Wendel, 1992).
The consecutive actions of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (606857)
and glutathione synthetase produce GSH from the amino acids cysteine,
glutamate, and glycine.

CLONING

Shi et al. (1996) cloned and characterized the human GSS gene.

MAPPING

Webb et al. (1995) found by Southern blots hybridized with a glutathione
synthetase cDNA that there appears to be a single glutathione synthetase
gene (GSS) in the human genome. Analysis of somatic cell hybrids showed
that GSS is located on chromosome 20, and this assignment was refined to
20q11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Shi et al. (1996) performed a mutation search of the GSS gene in 3
families with glutathione synthetase deficiency (GSSD; 266130), or
5-oxoprolinuria, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized, in its
severe form, by massive urinary excretion of 5-oxoproline, metabolic
acidosis, hemolytic anemia, and central nervous system damage. They
identified 7 mutations at the GSS locus on 6 alleles: 1 splice site
mutation, 2 deletions, and 4 missense mutations
(601002.0001-601002.0006). Bacterial expression and yeast
complementation assays of the cDNAs encoded by these alleles
demonstrated their functional defects. They also identified a homozygous
missense mutation in the GSS gene (601002.0007) in an individual
affected by the milder form of GSS deficiency, which is apparently
restricted to erythrocytes and only associated with hemolytic anemia
(GSSDE; 231900).

Dahl et al. (1997) identified a total of 13 different mutations in the
GSS gene in 9 patients with severe glutathione synthetase deficiency.
The patients were all unrelated and came from different geographic
areas. All patients had presented with metabolic acidosis, hemolytic
anemia, and 5-oxoprolinuria; however, neurologic symptoms were variable.
Among the 13 different missense mutations involved, 2 were found in
patients presenting with functional impairment of the central nervous
system. One of these, aged 22 years at last examination, had a low
normal IQ and abnormal retinogram. Four patients were found to be
compound heterozygotes and 2 were apparently homozygous. Reduced enzyme
activities were demonstrated in recombinant protein expressed from cDNAs
in 4 cases with different missense mutations. The results from
biochemical analysis of patient specimens, supported by the properties
of the expressed mutant proteins, indicated that residual activity was
present in affected individuals. Dahl et al. (1997) suggested that
complete loss of function of both glutathione synthetase alleles is
probably lethal. They postulated that missense mutations will account
for the phenotype in most patients with severe GS deficiency.

In 41 patients (33 previously reported) with glutathione synthetase
deficiency from 33 families, Njalsson et al. (2005) evaluated genotype,
enzyme activity, metabolite levels, and clinical phenotype. They
identified 27 different mutations; 23 patients were homozygotes and 18
were compound heterozygotes. The moderate and severe clinical phenotypes
could not be distinguished based on enzyme activity or glutathione or
gamma-glutamylcysteine levels in cultured fibroblasts. All mutations
causing frameshifts, premature stop codons, or aberrant splicing were
associated with moderate or severe clinical phenotypes. Njalsson et al.
(2005) concluded that additional genetic or environmental factors modify
at least the moderate and severe phenotypes and that the clinical
classification given to patients may be influenced by variation in
follow-up.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLUTATHIONE SYNTHETASE DEFICIENCY
GSS, ARG164GLN

In a family in which 2 brothers exhibited 5-oxoprolinuria (GSSD;
266130), metabolic acidosis, hemolytic anemia, and mental retardation,
Shi et al. (1996) found compound heterozygosity for mutations in the GSS
gene: a G-to-A transition at the end of exon 4 (position 491) of the
cDNA, which may cause an RNA splicing error or a missense mutation
(arg164-to-gln); and, in exon 1, a deletion of G corresponding to
nucleotide 3 or 4 in the cDNA sequence (+1ATGGCC...), predicting a
frameshift and/or abolition of the translation initiation site. These 2
changes were designated as 491G-A and 3(4)delG, respectively.

In a patient with 5-oxoprolinuria (266130), Shi et al. (1996) found
compound heterozygosity for 2 C-to-T transitions at nucleotides 799 and
847, implying 2 missense mutations: arg267 to trp and arg283 to cys
(601002.0004) in exons 8 and 9, respectively.

.0005
GLUTATHIONE SYNTHETASE DEFICIENCY
GSS, ARG125CYS

In a patient with 5-oxoprolinuria (266130), Shi et al. (1996) found 3
sequence alterations: 2 missense mutations (373C-T, leading to arg125 to
cys, and 941C-T, leading to pro314 to leu) plus a 6-bp in-frame deletion
(1137del6, resulting in the deletion of val380 and gln381) in exons 4,
9, and 11, respectively. The arg125-to-cys mutation was transmitted from
the father; the other 2 mutations came from the mother, indicating that
they are on the same allele (601002.0006). In an in vitro expression
system, the mutant cDNAs corresponding to the 2 alleles from this family
failed to complement and produced proteins with undetectable activity
(373C-T) or altered solubility (doubly mutant allele).

DUE TO
GSS, ASP219GLY

In a patient with GSS deficiency restricted to erythrocytes and
associated only with hemolytic anemia (GSSDE; 231900) (Mohler et al.,
1970), Shi et al. (1996) found homozygosity for the nucleotide
substitution 656A-G that resulted in the missense mutation asp219 to gly
(D219G). Although the patient's parents were not related, they were both
of Scottish descent, and the families had lived in the same county for
several generations. The allele was responsible for reduced activity and
instability of the expressed protein, but was more active than the other
6 alleles which were found by Shi et al. (1996) to result in
5-oxoprolinuria.

Vives Corrons et al. (2001) found the D219G mutation in 2 unrelated
Spanish adults with a well-compensated hemolytic syndrome without anemia
or splenomegaly at steady state. One of these patients was diagnosed
after an episode of acute hemolytic anemia following fava bean
ingestion.

609591	TITLE *609591 RIC-LIKE PROTEIN WITHOUT CAAX MOTIF 1; RIT1
;;RAS-LIKE PROTEIN EXPRESSED IN MANY TISSUES; RIT;;
ROC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RIT belongs to the RAS (HRAS; 190020) subfamily of small GTPases (Hynds
et al., 2003).

CLONING

By PCR using degenerate primers based on the conserved G3 and G4 domains
of RAS, followed by screening a mouse retina cDNA library, Lee et al.
(1996) cloned mouse Rit. The deduced 219-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 25.6 kD. By EST database analysis, Lee et
al. (1996) identified human RIT. The deduced human protein contains 219
amino acids and shares 94% identity with mouse Rit. Human and mouse RIT
have 5 highly conserved domains characteristic of small G proteins, but
they lack the C-terminal CAAX prenylation motif found in several other
RAS-like proteins. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.2-kb transcript
in all mouse tissues examined. Epitope-tagged mouse Rit localized to the
plasma membrane of transfected cells.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to Drosophila Ric,
Wes et al. (1996) identified human RIT and RIN (609592). The core GTPase
domain of RIT shares 76% identity with that of RIN, and there is only 1
conservative substitution between the 2 human proteins and Drosophila
Ric within the effector G2 region. Northern blot analysis detected RIT
transcripts of 1.35, 2.9, and 3.9 kb in most tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (1996) demonstrated that mouse Rit bound radiolabeled GTP.

Shao et al. (1999) demonstrated that recombinant human RIT and RIN bound
GTP and exhibited intrinsic GTPase activity. Conversion of gln79 to leu
in RIT resulted in complete loss of GTPase activity. The activity of RIT
and RIN was significantly different from that of the majority of
RAS-related GTPases, and the GTP dissociation rates were 5- to 10-fold
faster than most RAS-like GTPases. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis showed that
RIT and RIN interacted with the RAS-binding proteins RALGDS (601619),
RLF (180610), and AF6 (MLLT4; 159559), but not with RAF kinases (e.g.,
RAF1; 164760), RIN1 (605965), or the p110 subunit of PI3K (see 171834).
Shao et al. (1999) concluded that RIT and RIN regulate signaling
pathways and cellular processes distinct from those controlled by RAS.

By expression of RIT in a human neuroblastoma cell line, Hynds et al.
(2003) demonstrated that RIT increased neurite outgrowth and branching
through MEK (see MEK1; 176872)-dependent and MEK-independent signaling
mechanisms, respectively. Adenoviral expression of wildtype or
constitutively active RIT increased neurite initiation, elongation, and
branching on endogenous matrix or a purified laminin-1 substratum. This
outgrowth was morphologically distinct from that promoted by
constitutively active RAS or RAF. Constitutively active RIT increased
phosphorylation of ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948), but not
AKT (see AKT1; 164730). A MEK inhibitor blocked RIT-induced neurite
initiation, but not elongation or branching.

Shi and Andres (2005) found that stimulation of a rat pheochromocytoma
cell line by growth factors, including nerve growth factor (NGF;
162030), resulted in rapid and prolonged Rit activation. Ectopic
expression of active human RIT promoted neurite outgrowth and stimulated
activation of both Erk and p38 MAP kinase (MAPK14; 600289) signaling
pathways. RIT-induced differentiation depended upon both MAP kinase
cascades, since MEK inhibition blocked RIT-induced neurite outgrowth,
and p38 blockade inhibited neurite elongation and branching, but not
neurite initiation. Moreover, the ability of NGF to promote neuronal
differentiation was attenuated by Rit knockdown.

Heo et al. (2006) surveyed plasma membrane targeting mechanisms by
imaging the subcellular localization of 125 fluorescent
protein-conjugated Ras, Rab, Arf, and Rho proteins. Of 48 proteins that
were localized to the plasma membrane, 37 contained clusters of
positively charged amino acids. To test whether these polybasic clusters
bind negatively charged phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate lipids,
Heo et al. (2006) developed a chemical phosphatase activation method to
deplete plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.
Unexpectedly, proteins with polybasic clusters dissociated from the
plasma membrane only when both phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate were depleted, arguing that
both lipid second messengers jointly regulate plasma membrane targeting.

MAPPING

Wes et al. (1996) stated that the RIT gene was mapped to chromosome 1 by
somatic cell hybrid analysis. The mouse Rit gene maps to chromosome 3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 17 unrelated patients with Noonan syndrome-8 (NS8; 615355), Aoki et
al. (2013) identified heterozygous mutations in the RIT1 gene (see,
e.g., 609591.0001-609591.0004). The first mutations were found by exome
sequencing and subsequent mutations were identified from a larger cohort
of patients screened for the RIT1 gene. A total of 9 missense mutations
were found in 17 (9%) of 180 individuals suspected to have the disorder.
The phenotype was characterized by short stature, distinctive facial
features, and a high incidence of congenital heart defects and
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A subset of patients showed intellectual
disabilities. All of the mutations occurred de novo, except in 1 patient
who inherited the mutation from a mother with a Noonan syndrome
phenotype. The mutations tended to cluster in the switch II region, and
in vitro functional expression studies of 3 of the mutations showed that
they resulted in a gain of function. Transfection of 2 of the mutations
into zebrafish embryos resulted in a variety of developmental defects,
including gastrulation defects, craniofacial abnormalities, pericardial
edema, and elongated yolk sac. A smaller percentage of mutant embryos
showed even more disorganized growth and abnormal cardiogenesis. The
findings were similar to those observed with mutations in other RAS
genes (see, e.g., PTPN11, 176876; SOS1, 182530; NRAS, 164790) causing
other forms of Noonan syndrome.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NOONAN SYNDROME 8
RIT1, ALA57GLY

In 4 unrelated patients with Noonan syndrome-8 (NS8; 615355), Aoki et
al. (2013) identified a de novo heterozygous c.170C-G transversion in
exon 4 of the RIT1 gene, resulting in an ala57-to-gly (A57G)
substitution at a conserved residue. In vitro cellular expression
studies showed that the A57G mutation resulted in a gain of function.

.0002
NOONAN SYNDROME 8
RIT1, GLU81GLY

In a patient with Noonan syndrome-8 (615355), Aoki et al. (2013)
identified a de novo heterozygous c.242A-G transition in exon 5 of the
RIT1 gene, resulting in a glu81-to-gly (E81G) substitution at a
conserved residue. In vitro cellular expression studies showed that the
E81G mutation resulted in a gain of function. Transfection of the E81G
mutation into zebrafish embryos resulted in a variety of developmental
defects, including gastrulation defects, craniofacial abnormalities,
pericardial edema, and elongated yolk sac. A smaller percentage of
mutant embryos showed even more disorganized growth and abnormal
cardiogenesis.

.0003
NOONAN SYNDROME 8
RIT1, PHE82LEU

In 2 unrelated patients with Noonan syndrome-8 (615355), Aoki et al.
(2013) identified a de novo heterozygous c.246T-G transversion in exon 5
of the RIT1 gene, resulting in a phe82-to-leu (F82L) substitution at a
conserved residue. The mutation, which was initially found by exome
sequencing, was not present in several control databases. In vitro
cellular expression studies showed that the F82L mutation resulted in a
gain of function.

.0004
NOONAN SYNDROME 8
RIT1, GLY95ALA

In 4 unrelated patients with Noonan syndrome-8 (615355), Aoki et al.
(2013) identified a de novo heterozygous c.284G-C transversion in exon 5
of the RIT1 gene, resulting in a gly95-to-ala (G95A) substitution. The
mutation, which was initially found by exome sequencing, was not present
in several control databases. In vitro cellular expression studies
showed that the G95A mutation resulted in a gain of function.
Transfection of the G95A mutation into zebrafish embryos resulted in a
variety of developmental defects, including gastrulation defects,
craniofacial abnormalities, pericardial edema, and elongated yolk sac. A
smaller percentage of mutant embryos showed even more disorganized
growth and abnormal cardiogenesis.

601239	TITLE *601239 DYSTROBREVIN, ALPHA; DTNA
;;DYSTROBREVIN;;
DYSTROPHIN-RELATED PROTEIN 3; DRP3;;
D18S892E
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for novel dystrophin (300377)-related
genes, followed by screening human adult brain and skeletal muscle cDNA
libraries, Sadoulet-Puccio et al. (1996) cloned dystrobrevin. The
largest ORF in the dystrobrevin gene shows 50% homology to the
cysteine-rich and C-terminal domains of dystrophin, and 84% homology to
a phosphoprotein found in the electric organ postsynaptic membrane in
Torpedo californica. Five distinct mRNA transcripts were preferentially
expressed in different tissues.

Newey et al. (2001) stated that 3 Dtna isoforms are expressed in mouse
skeletal muscle. The longest isoform, Dtna1, contains an N-terminal
EF-hand region, followed by zinc-binding ZZ domain, a muscle-expressed
variable region, 2 coiled-coil regions, and a C-terminal domain with a
tyrosine phosphorylation motif. Dtna1 also has 2 syntrophin (see SNTA1;
601017)-binding sites that overlap the variable region and a
dystrophin-binding site that overlaps the first coiled-coil domain.
Dtna2 lacks part of the C-terminal domain, including the tyrosine
phosphorylation motif, and Dtna3 lacks the variable region and
coiled-coil domains.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sadoulet-Puccio et al. (1997) determined that the DTNA gene contains 23
exons and spans at least 180 kb. Three different C termini of
dystrobrevin are generated by mutually exclusive mRNA splicing of 3
exons. Two alternatively spliced exons (exons 11A and 12) are used
exclusively in striated muscle. A comparison of the genomic organization
of dystrophin and dystrobrevin showed that the 2 genes have significant
similarities in their genomic structure, implying an ancestral or
evolutionary relationship.

MAPPING

Khurana et al. (1994) mapped an EST corresponding to the DTNA gene to
chromosome 18q12.1-q12.2 by FISH.

Ambrose et al. (1997) mapped the mouse homolog of dystrobrevin to
proximal mouse chromosome 18.

GENE FUNCTION

The dystrophin-associated protein complex (DPC), located at the
sarcolemma, can be divided into 3 subcomplexes: the dystroglycan
complex, the sarcoglycan complex, and the cytoplasmic complex. The last
consists of 2 families of proteins, the syntrophins and dystrobrevin.
Metzinger et al. (1997) found that anti-dystrobrevin antibodies stain
the sarcolemma in normal skeletal muscle, indicating that dystrobrevin
colocalizes with dystrophin and the dystrophin-associated protein
complex. By contrast, dystrobrevin membrane staining was severely
reduced in muscles of Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients and also
dramatically reduced in patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy
arising from the loss of 1 or all of the sarcoglycan components (e.g.,
LGMD2C; 253700). Normal dystrobrevin staining was observed in patients
with other forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy where dystrophin and
the rest of the dystrophin-associated protein complex are normally
expressed (e.g., LGMD2A; 253600), as well as in other neuromuscular
disorders. Their results showed that dystrobrevin deficiency is a
generic feature of dystrophies linked to dystrophin and the
dystrophin-associated proteins. This was the first indication that a
cytoplasmic component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex may
be involved in the pathogenesis of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.

Yoshida et al. (2000) found that the N-terminal half of dystrobrevin
participates in an association with the sarcoglycan-sarcospan complex.
The authors hypothesized that the sarcoglycan-sarcospan complex is
linked to the signaling protein neuronal nitric oxide synthase (163731)
via alpha-syntrophin (601017) associated with dystrobrevin.

The mammalian dystrobrevin gene encodes several protein isoforms that
are expressed in different tissues, including brain and muscle. Blake et
al. (1998) reported a form of dystrobrevin, designated beta-dystrobrevin
(602415) by them, a dystrophin-related protein that is abundantly
expressed in brain and other tissues, but is not found in muscle. The
dystrobrevin in muscle was designated alpha-dystrobrevin.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation analysis of
transfected COS-7 cells, Newey et al. (2001) showed that the mouse
intermediate filament protein syncoilin (SYNC1; 611750) interacted with
mouse Dtna1 and Dtna2. Dtna and syncoilin colocalized at the
neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscle. Newey et al. (2001) concluded
that DTNA provides a link between dystrophin protein complex and the
intermediate filament network at the neuromuscular junction.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a 4-generation Japanese family with left ventricular noncompaction
(LVNC1; 604169), Ichida et al. (2001) analyzed the DTNA gene and
identified heterozygosity for a missense mutation (P121L; 601239.0001)
in affected members that was not found in unaffected family members or
in 300 age- and sex-matched controls.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LEFT VENTRICULAR NONCOMPACTION 1
DTNA, PRO121LEU

In 6 affected members of a 4-generation Japanese family with left
ventricular noncompaction-1 (604169), Ichida et al. (2001) identified
heterozygosity for a 362C-T transition in exon 3 of the DTNA gene,
resulting in a pro121-to-leu (P121L) substitution. Protein sequence
analysis predicted that the P121L substitution would result in the
reduction of an alpha-helix by 2 amino acids and the removal of a loop
in this portion of the protein, which encodes the calcium-binding
EF-hand domain, possibly resulting in a significant secondary structural
change. Five of the 6 affected family members had other congenital heart
defects, primarily one or more ventricular septal defects, in addition
to LVNC. The mutation was not found in unaffected family members or in
300 age- and sex-matched controls (200 of which were Japanese and 100
Caucasian).

118970	TITLE *118970 CLATHRIN, LIGHT POLYPEPTIDE B; CLTB
;;LCB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Clathrin is the main structural component of the lattice covering the
cytoplasmic face of the coated pits and coated vesicles in which
specific macromolecules are entrapped in the process of
receptor-mediated endocytosis. Clathrin is a large, soluble protein
composed of heavy chains, which have molecular masses of about 192 kD,
and light chains, which have molecular masses of about 32 to 38 kD. Two
major classes of clathrin light chains, referred to as LCA (CLTA;
118960) and LCB (CTLB), have been identified (summary by Kirchhausen et
al., 1987). For additional information on clathrin, see 118960.

CLONING

Jackson et al. (1987) identified 4 distinct forms of bovine clathrin
light chains. This molecular variability derived from tissue-specific
splicing of Lca and Lcb genes.

Brodsky et al. (1987) identified that part of the light chain sequence
that mediates heavy chain binding and is the region of strongest
homology with intermediate filament proteins. Sequence analysis shows an
overall homology of 60% between LCA and LCB and the presence of
brain-specific insertion sequences.

Jackson and Parham (1988) compared cDNAs encoding the brain and nonbrain
forms of human LCA and LCB with their homologs in cow and rat. The
significant differences that distinguish LCA from LCB and the brain from
the nonbrain forms show remarkable preservation in all 3 species. Each
clathrin triskelion consists of 3 heavy chains and 3 light chains. In
the brain, tissue-specific mRNA splicing yields larger forms of LCA and
LCB, containing additional insertion sequences of 30 and 18 amino acids,
respectively.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis carried out on genomic DNA extracted from a
panel of mouse-human somatic cell hybrids and by isotopic in situ
hybridization, Ponnambalam et al. (1994) assigned the CLTB gene to human
chromosome 4q2-q3. However, Gross (2011) mapped the CLTB gene to
chromosome 5q35.2 based on an alignment of the CLTB sequence (GenBank
GENBANK BC006457) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

607668	TITLE *607668 ADP-RIBOSYLATION-LIKE FACTOR 6-INTERACTING PROTEIN 4; ARL6IP4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Sasahara et al. (2000) cloned novel mouse and human cDNAs, which they
designated SR-25, from insulinoma cDNA libraries. The deduced human
218-amino acid protein shares 77.7% sequence identity with the mouse
homolog and contains a serine-arginine (SR) repeat and 2 types of amino
acid clusters: a serine cluster and a highly basic cluster. Northern
blot analysis detected expression in all mouse tissues tested, with
abundant expression in testis and thymus. Based on the structure and
expression pattern of SR-25, Sasahara et al. (2000) suggested that the
protein is localized in the nucleus and may contribute to RNA splicing.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ARL6IP4
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP stSG29931).

;;SPONDYLOCARPOTARSAL SYNDROME;;
SYNSPONDYLISM, CONGENITAL;;
VERTEBRAL FUSION WITH CARPAL COALITION;;
SCOLIOSIS, CONGENITAL, WITH UNILATERAL UNSEGMENTED BAR
DESCRIPTION A number sign (#) is used with this entry because spondylocarpotarsal
synostosis syndrome is caused by mutation in the gene encoding filamin B
(FLNB; 603381) on chromosome 3p14.3.

CLINICAL FEATURES

Wiles et al. (1992) used the designation congenital synspondylism for a
form of congenital familial extensive vertebral anomalies (CFEVA). They
suggested that this represents an entity separate from spondylocostal
dysplasia (SCD; 122600) and spondylothoracic dysplasia (STD; 277300).
They reported 2 brothers and an unrelated girl who had an unusual
constellation of vertebral fusions without rib anomalies as well as
carpal coalition. By analogy to symphalangism (185800), they chose the
designation synspondylism. The 2 brothers had Lebanese parents born in
the same district of Lebanon but not known to be consanguineous. Two
sibs with apparently the same disorder were reported by Langer and Moe
(1975) and by Akbarnia and Moe (1978). Scoliosis was a more impressive
feature than in the case of the Lebanese brothers reported by Wiles et
al. (1992). Akbarnia and Moe (1978) referred to the condition as
'familial congenital scoliosis with unilateral unsegmented bar.' Their
patients were an Iranian brother and sister whose parents were first
cousins. Both showed right thoracic lordoscoliosis with failure of
segmentation on the left from the third to the eleventh thoracic
vertebra. Both had clubfeet as well as partial coalition of the carpal
bones. Ventruto and Catani (1986) described 2 Italian brothers, aged 16
and 8 years, who had 8 normal sibs and whose gypsy parents were first
cousins. The unilateral unsegmented fusion bar was on the left in the
older brother and on the right in the younger brother. Ventruto and
Catani (1986) were impressed by the presence of joint laxity, congenital
inguinal hernias, clubfoot, and peculiar facies (hypertelorism, short
nasal septum, and broad bridge and tip of the nose).

Langer et al. (1994) reported 6 additional patients, 2 of them sibs.
They used the term spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome, with or
without unilateral unsegmented bar, because carpal synostosis, usually
capitate-hamate and lunate-triquetrum, was a feature and tarsal
synostoses were present in all patients in whom the feet had been
radiographed. The patients were of short stature, with
disproportionately short trunk. The feet were flat. Cleft palate and
sensorineural or mixed hearing loss were variable manifestations. Wiles
et al. (1992) gave a useful review of several types of congenital
familial extensive vertebral anomalies, including the costovertebral
segmentation defect with mesomelia (COVESDEM syndrome; 268310).

Coelho et al. (1998) described 3 patients (2 of them sibs born to
first-cousin parents) with spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome.
Sensorineural deafness was found in 2 of the 3 patients. Of 18 reported
patients, including these 3, 10 were sib pairs from 5 families, with
first-cousin consanguinity of parents in 3.

Seaver and Boyd (2000) reported a sporadic case, which they stated
brought the number of well-documented cases of spondylocarpotarsal
synostosis to 19 and was the first case documenting cervical spine
instability. The 5-year-old girl had hypoplasia of C1 and odontoid and
subluxation of C2 on C3.

Steiner et al. (2000) reported a Brazilian family with
spondylocarpotarsal synostosis. The parents were first cousins and had
10 children, 5 of whom were affected. The 3 described in the report had
short-trunk dwarfism of postnatal onset, scoliosis, unsegmented thoracic
vertebrae with unilateral bar, and carpal bone fusion. Lens opacities,
rarefaction of retinal pigmentation, and narrowing of retinal vessels
were seen in 2 patients. These ocular manifestations may be coincidental
or represent previously undescribed findings in this condition.

Mitter et al. (2008) described a 5-year-old German boy, born of
first-cousin parents, with spondylocarpotarsal synostosis and a mutation
in the FLNB gene (603381.0013). In addition to the typical findings of
this disorder, he demonstrated ossification delay of multiple epiphyses
(especially delayed carpal bone age) and bilateral proximal femoral
epiphyseal dysplasia. Similar radiographic findings were described in
another boy with spondylocarpotarsal synostosis reported by Honeywell et
al. (2002).

Brunetti-Pierri et al. (2008) reported an Italian girl, born of
consanguineous parents, with spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome due
to a homozygous FLNB mutation (603381.0014). She had short stature,
scoliosis, short trunk, delayed bone age, vertebral fusions, and
capitate-hamate fusion. She did not have facial dysmorphic features.
Growth hormone (GH) deficiency was documented, but there was no response
to GH administration. MRI did not show any abnormality of the
hypothalamo-pituitary area, but there was platybasia and basilar
impression, stenosis of the foramen magnum, but no signs of medullary
compression at the cervicomedullary junction. A younger brother, who was
heterozygous for the mutation, had short stature and transient GH
deficiency.

INHERITANCE

Autosomal recessive inheritance of spondylocarpotarsal synostosis
syndrome was confirmed by the finding of homozygous or compound
heterozygous mutations in the FLNB gene (603381) in patients with the
disorder.

MAPPING

In a study of 4 families with spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome, 3
of which were consanguineous, Steiner et al. (2004) used linkage
analysis to establish that the disease gene is located on chromosome
3p14. A common region of homozygosity was found between markers D3S3724
and D3S1300 on 3p, defining a physical interval of approximately 4
million bp.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 4 unrelated SCT families, Krakow et al. (2004) found that affected
individuals were either homozygous or compound heterozygous for nonsense
mutations in the FLNB gene (603381). In all 4 families, the segregation
of the mutations was compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance.
The premature stop codons all were located within the repeat domain of
filamin B, and Krakow et al. (2004) concluded that SCT results from the
absence or truncation of filamin B.

HETEROGENEITY

Isidor et al. (2008) described a mother and her son with clinical and
radiologic criteria for spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome.
Molecular analysis failed to identify mutations in the FLNB or the NOG
gene (602991). Isidor et al. (2008) suggested that SCT is genetically
heterogeneous and that both dominant and autosomal recessive forms of
inheritance should be considered.

;;CELL DIVISION CYCLE 2-LIKE 5; CDC2L5;;
CELL DIVISION CONTROLLER, CHOLINESTERASE-RELATED; CHED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lapidot-Lifson et al. (1992) cloned a glioblastoma cDNA encoding a
protein related to the S. pombe cdc2 kinase. They designated the
predicted 418-amino acid protein CHED, for cholinesterase-related cell
division controller. The CHED protein shares 34 to 42% sequence identity
with human CDC2 (116940), S. cerevisiae Cdc28, and S. pombe Cdc2, 3
functionally interchangeable proteins. Northern blot analysis revealed
that CHED is expressed as 2.2- to 2.3-kb mRNAs in several fetal tissues
and tumor cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an antisense oligonucleotide, Lapidot-Lifson et al. (1992) found
that reduced CHED expression selectively inhibited megakaryocyte
development in murine bone marrow cultures but did not prevent other
hematopoietic pathways. Antisense mRNA inhibition of BCHE (177400)
expression had a similar effect. The authors suggested that CHED and
BCHE are interrelated components responsive to cholinergic signals in
the hematopoietic pathway. They stated that a link between cholinergic
signaling and cell division might be mediated through individual CDC
proteins in a cell lineage-specific manner.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the CDK13 gene to chromosome 7p14.1 based on an
alignment of the CDK13 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AJ297709) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

612681	TITLE *612681 CUGBP- AND ELAV-LIKE FAMILY, MEMBER 6; CELF6
;;BRUNO-LIKE 6; BRUNOL6;;
CUGBP- AND ETR3-LIKE FACTOR 6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the CELF family, such as CELF6, play various roles in
cotranscriptional and posttranscriptional RNA processing. All CELF
proteins appear to affect pre-mRNA splicing, but individual CELFs have
divergent roles in regulating mRNA stability and translation (summary by
Wagnon et al., 2012).

CLONING

By searching databases for human sequences similar to Xenopus Brunol1
(TNRC4; 612678), Good et al. (2000) identified BRUNOL6. The deduced
protein contains 2 N-terminal domain RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs), a
long linker region, and a C-terminal RRM.

By searching genomic sequences from CELF-like proteins, followed by PCR
of a human brain cDNA library, Ladd et al. (2004) cloned full-length
BRUNOL6, which they called CELF6. The deduced 481-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 50.4 kD. CELF6 has 3 RRMs, with a
268-amino acid divergent domain separating RRM2 and RRM3. It also has
numerous potential phosphorylation sites, a potential nuclear
localization signal at the C terminus, and an alanine-rich region within
the divergent domain. Ladd et al. (2004) also identified 3 splice
variants of CELF6 that encode proteins with C-terminal truncations
compared with full-length CELF6 (isoform-1). Isoform-2 contains RRM1 and
part of RRM2, isoform-3, the shortest isoform, contains only RRM1, and
isoform-4 contains RRM1, RRM2, and part of the divergent domain.
Northern blot analysis detected 7.5- and 4.0-kb transcripts that were
abundantly expressed in kidney and brain, respectively. Both variants
were detected at low levels in several other tissues. RNA dot blot
analysis revealed highest CELF6 expression in adult kidney, brain, and
testis, with low expression in most other tissues. CELF6 was detected in
fetal brain, but only low expression was detected in fetal kidney.
Western blot analysis showed that full-length CELF6, isoform-2, and
isoform-4 were expressed in transfected quail fibroblasts, but isoform-3
was not detected, apparently due to protein instability.

GENE FUNCTION

CELF proteins (e.g., TNRC4; 612678) promote active exon inclusion of
cardiac troponin T (TNNT2; 191045) minigenes in vivo via muscle-specific
splicing enhancer (MSE) sequences. Ladd et al. (2004) showed that
full-length CELF6, isoform-2, and isoform-4 promoted exon inclusion from
these minigenes in a dose- and isoform-dependent manner. Full-length
CELF6 also promoted insulin receptor (INSR; 147670) exon 11 skipping in
a dose-dependent manner, similar to CUGBP (601074), whereas CELF6
isoform-4 showed weaker exon skipping potential, and isoform-2 had no
effect.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Good et al. (2000) mapped the BRUNOL6 gene
to chromosome 15q24.

CELL CYCLE PROGRESSION RESTORATION 2; CPR2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a hepatoma cDNA expression library for clones that could
block mating pheromone-induced G1 arrest in yeast, Edwards et al. (1997)
cloned TBRG4, which they called CPR2. The deduced protein contains
multiple putative leucine zipper domains characteristic of transcription
factors.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned TBRG4, which they designated
KIAA0948. The transcript contains several repetitive elements in the
3-prime untranslated region. The deduced 521-amino acid protein shares
significant similarity with rat Cpr2. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate
expression in ovary, and little to no expression in all other tissues
and specific brain regions examined.

MAPPING

By FISH, Edwards et al. (1997) mapped the TBRG4 gene to chromosome
7p14-p13.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated immature myeloid
cell line cDNA library, Nomura et al. (1994) cloned ZNF33A, which they
designated KIAA0065. The transcript has an Alu element in its 3-prime
UTR. The deduced 848-amino acid protein contains a C2H2-type zinc finger
domain and shares 93.1% identity with ZNF11B (ZNF33B; 194522) over 374
amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected ZNF33A expression in all
tissues examined, with highest expression in skeletal muscle, and lowest
expression in testis and colon.

Using ZAK (609479) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a heart cDNA
library, followed by screening a placenta cDNA library and 5-prime RACE,
Yang (2003) cloned ZNF33A, which they designated ZZAPK. The deduced
810-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 94.3 kD. ZZAPK
contains an N-terminal KRAB domain, followed by a 256-amino acid linker
region and 16 tandemly repeated Kruppel-type zinc fingers at its C
terminus. Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of a major
5.5-kb transcript in all tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation of cotransfected human embryonic kidney (HEK293)
cells, Yang (2003) confirmed direct interaction between epitope-tagged
ZZAPK and ZAK. Mutation analysis indicated that the SAM domain of ZAK
was required to bind ZZAPK. By coexpression in a rat fibroblast cell
line, Yang (2003) determined that ZZAPK countered the effect of ZAK on
G2/M cell cycle arrest. When expressed alone, ZZAPK increased entry of
cells into S phase. ZZAPK increased expression of cyclin E (CCNE1;
123837) in rat fibroblasts and HEK293 cells. ZZAPK also increased
expression of transcription factor E2F (see 189971) and the activity of
an E2F-dependent reporter gene.

MAPPING

By a combination of in situ chromosomal hybridization and somatic cell
hybrid analysis, Rousseau-Merck et al. (1992) concluded that there are
sequences hybridizing to the KOX2 probe at 2 loci, which they called
ZNF11A (ZNF33A) and ZNF11B (ZNF33B), that map proximal and distal to a
10q11.2 breakpoint, respectively. They suggested that the 2 ZNF11 loci
represent related sequences. Rousseau-Merck et al. (1992) suggested that
this cluster of zinc finger protein genes (ZNF11, ZNF22 (194529), and
ZNF25 (194528)) is of particular interest since the loci for MEN2A and
MEN2B map to this region.

Tunnacliffe et al. (1993) identified 2 related zinc finger gene clusters
mapping to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 10. Cluster A
contains ZNF11A (ZNF33A) and ZNF37A and maps to chromosome 10p11.2.
Cluster B contains ZNF11B (ZNF33B) and ZNF37B and maps to chromosome
10q11.2. Southern blot analysis indicated that the 2 clusters evolved by
duplication of an ancestral gene cluster before the divergence of the
human and great ape lineages.

DESCRIPTION Hippocalcin-like-1 is a member of a family of neuron-specific
Ca(2+)-binding proteins found in the retina and brain.

CLONING

Using rat hippocalcin (142622) cDNA as a probe in the screening of a
human hippocampus cDNA library under low stringency conditions,
Kobayashi et al. (1994) isolated a clone that encoded a novel
calcium-binding protein structurally related to hippocalcin. They showed
that this hippocalcin-like protein has a primary structure of 193 amino
acids and contains 3 EF-hand structures and a possible NH2-terminal
myristoylation site. A single transcript of 1.7 kb was detected only in
the brain.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Kobayashi et al. (1994) mapped the
HPCAL1 gene to chromosome 2.

;;NEUDESIN;;
CELL IMMORTALIZATION-RELATED PROTEIN 2; CIR2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display to identify transcripts up-regulated in
immortalized cells, Ma et al. (1998) identified a transcript, which they
named CIR2, that was 2- to 3-fold elevated in human embryonic kidney
cells transformed with SV40. Kimura et al. (2005) identified and cloned
cDNA for the same protein in mouse, which they called neudesin. The
deduced 171-amino acid secreted protein contains a 24-amino acid signal
peptide. Kimura et al. (2005) also cloned the human cDNA for neudesin
from brain and found that it encodes a deduced 172-amino acid protein
with 90% sequence similarity to the mouse protein. In mice, in situ
hybridization showed abundant expression of neudesin in developing brain
and spinal cord, and RT-PCR of postnatal tissues demonstrated expression
in brain, heart, lung, and kidney. The protein was expressed in neurons
but not in glial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Kimura et al. (2006) showed that neudesin was expressed in early
development in mouse embryonic cerebral cortex in neural precursor
cells. Studies in culture showed that neudesin promoted neuronal
differentiation and inhibited differentiation of astrocytes. Kimura et
al. (2008) observed that siRNA targeted against neudesin resulted in
decreased survival of Neuro2a cells.

Kimura et al. (2008) noted that neudesin has a predicted cytochrome
b5-like heme/steroid-binding domain, and determined that
Fe(III)-protoporphyrin IX is required for its neurotrophic activity. An
anti-neudesin antibody detected a 15.6-kD band in media from cultured
Neuro2a cells and was used in experiments to confirm that the protein
binds heme. Kimura et al. (2008) stated that neudesin was the first
extracellular heme-binding protein found to be involved in intercellular
signal transduction.

MAPPING

Kimura et al. (2005) stated that the NENF gene maps to chromosome 1p33;
however, Scott (2008) mapped the gene to 1q32.3 based on an alignment of
the NENF sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB126219) with the genomic sequence
(build 36.2).

;;TIA1-RELATED PROTEIN; TIAR;;
T CLUSTER-BINDING PROTEIN; TCBP
DESCRIPTION Cytotoxic lymphocytes can induce target cells to activate apoptosis.
Central to this autolytic pathway is the activation of an endogenous
endonuclease that degrades target cell DNA. By screening a human
phytohemagglutinin-activated T-cell cDNA library with a TIA1 (603518)
cDNA, Kawakami et al. (1992) cloned a cDNA encoding TIA1-related protein
(TIAR). Both TIAR and TIA1 are members of a family of RNA-binding
proteins containing 3 RNA-binding domains and a C-terminal auxiliary
domain. Like TIA1, TIAR possesses a lysosome-targeting motif in its
C-terminal auxiliary domain, suggesting that TIAR is also a cytotoxic
granule-associated protein. The authors demonstrated that TIAR binds
specifically to poly(A) homopolymers, fragments DNA in permeabilized
target cells, and is expressed in a wide variety of hematopoietic and
nonhematopoietic cell types.

Using a Southwestern approach to identify proteins capable of binding to
the T cluster of the platelet factor-4 (PF4; 173460) promoter, Doi et
al. (1997) isolated a human erythroleukemia (HEL) cell cDNA encoding an
isoform of TIAL1, which they called TCBP. This deduced 265-amino acid
isoform differs from the isoform identified by Kawakami et al. (1992) at
the C terminus, where a hydrophobic sequence replaces the
lysosome-targeting motif. Doi et al. (1997) demonstrated that TCBP
specifically binds to the T cluster and the proximal T-rich region of
the PF4 promoter in vitro and that TCBP reduces gene expression from the
PF4 promoter. TCBP mRNA expression was reduced when HEL cells were
induced to differentiate to megakaryocytes.

By hybridization to YACs and radiation hybrid mapping, Doi et al. (1997)
localized the TIAL1 gene to 10q, 4.92 cR distal to WI-5255.

By screening brain and heart cDNA libraries using PITPNM3 (608921) as
probe, Lev et al. (1999) cloned PITPNM2, which they called NIR3. The
deduced 1,349-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 150
kD. PITPNM2 shares structural domains with other PITPNM family members,
including an N-terminal phosphatidylinositol (PI) transfer domain, an
acidic calcium-binding region, 6 transmembrane domains, and a conserved
C-terminal domain. Lev et al. (1999) also cloned a PITPNM3 splice
variant that encodes a protein lacking amino acids 50 to 328 in the
N-terminal PI transfer domain. The calculated molecular mass of this
variant is 125 kD. Northern blot analysis detected PITPNM2 transcripts
of 7.5 and 9.5 kb that were highly expressed in thymus, heart, brain,
ovary, and testis. Immunohistochemical analysis of adult rat brain found
Pitpnm2 prominently expressed in cell bodies within pyramidal layer V
and in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. PITPNM2 expression was also
detected in supraoptic nuclei, in the middle of the preoptic region, and
in the inner segment and the inner and outer plexiform layers of the
retina.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned PITPNM2, which they designated
KIAA1457. RT-PCR ELISA detected robust PITPNM2 expression in all adult
and fetal tissues and all specific brain regions examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Lev et al. (1999) found that the acidic domain of PITPNM2 bound calcium,
the C-terminal domain bound PYK2 (601212), and the isolated PI transfer
domain supported PI transfer in mutant yeast. Analysis of PITPNM2 or
PYK2 immunoprecipitates of cells coexpressing PITPNM2 and PYK2
demonstrated that both proteins were tyrosine phosphorylated, suggesting
that PITPNM2 is a PYK2 substrate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ocaka et al. (2005) determined that the PITPNM2 gene contains 25 exons
and spans approximately 49 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the PITPNM2
gene to chromosome 12. Ocaka et al. (2005) mapped the PITPNM2 gene to
chromosome 12p24 using radiation hybrid analysis and FISH.

300522	TITLE *300522 IQ MOTIF- AND SEC7 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; IQSEC2
;;KIAA0522
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The IQSEC2 gene encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the ARF
family of GTP-binding proteins (see, e.g., ARF1; 103180) (Shoubridge et
al., 2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned IQSEC2, which they designated
KIAA0522. The deduced 1,560-amino acid protein shares weak homology with
rat Sec7a. RT-PCR detected high expression of IQSEC2 in brain, kidney,
and small intestine, and intermediate to low expression in placenta,
pancreas, ovary, prostate, and liver. No expression was detected in
other tissues examined.

Shoubridge et al. (2010) characterized 2 isoforms of the IQSEC2 gene
that are generated by alternative splicing. The longer isoform contains
15 exons and encodes a 1,488-residue protein, whereas the shorter
isoform contains 14 exons and encodes a 949-residue protein. The
proteins have 906 amino acids in common, which include the IQ, Sec7, and
PH functional domains, but vary at both the N and C termini. An
alternative transcript for the longer isoform, resulting in a
1,478-residue protein, was also proposed. Both the long and short
isoforms were expressed in fetal and adult human brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Filippova et al. (2005) determined that the mouse Iqsec2 gene is subject
to X inactivation, but human IQSEC2 escapes X inactivation. They
attributed this difference to the presence of a CTCF (604167)-binding
site at the 5-prime end of the upstream Jarid1c gene (314690) in mice
that is not present in humans.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the IQSEC2
gene to chromosome X. Filippova et al. (2005) noted that the mouse
Iqsec2 gene also maps to chromosome X. In both mice and humans, the
IQSEC2 gene lies between the JARID1C and SMC1A (300040) genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 4 unrelated families with X-linked nonsyndromic
mental retardation (MRX1; 309530), Shoubridge et al. (2010) identified 4
different hemizygous mutations in the IQSEC2 gene
(300522.0001-300522.0004). Some carrier females had learning
disabilities. The authors suggested that a defect in the GTP-binding
activity of mutant IQSEC2 may influence the regulation of actin
cytoskeleton organization and neuronal development in the brain.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED 1
IQSEC2, ARG863TRP

In affected members of a family with X-linked mental retardation 1
(MRX1; 309530) reported by Suthers et al. (1988), Shoubridge et al.
(2010) identified a 2587C-T transition in exon 8 of the IQSEC2 gene,
resulting in an arg863-to-trp (R863W) substitution affecting a conserved
residue in the Sec7 domain. The mutation was not found in 1,310 control
individuals. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutant protein had significantly decreased GTP binding to ARF6 (600464)
compared to wildtype.

2402A-C transversion in exon 6 of the IQSEC2 gene, resulting in a
gln801-to-pro (Q801P) substitution affecting a conserved residue in the
Sec7 domain. The mutation was not found in 1,310 control individuals. In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant protein had
significantly decreased GTP binding to ARF6 (600464) compared to
wildtype.

exon 5 of the IQSEC2 gene, resulting in an arg758-to-gln (R758Q)
substitution affecting a conserved residue in the Sec7 domain. The
mutation was not found in 1,310 control individuals. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the mutant protein had significantly
decreased GTP binding to ARF6 (600464) compared to wildtype.

In affected members of an Australian family with X-linked mental

transition in exon 4 of the IQSEC2 gene, resulting in an arg359-to-cys
(R359C) substitution affecting a conserved residue in the IQ-like
domain. The mutation was not found in 1,310 control individuals. In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant protein
resulted in a decrease of GTP-bound ARF6 (600464).

606357	TITLE *606357 DEAD/H BOX 21; DDX21
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DDX21, a member of the DEAD box gene family, encodes a putative
ATP-dependent RNA helicase that unwinds double-stranded RNA, folds
single-stranded RNA, and may play important roles in ribosomal RNA
biogenesis, RNA editing, RNA transport, and general transcription. For
additional background information on the DEAD box gene family, see DDX8
(600396).

CLONING

To identify an antigen recognized by the autoimmune serum of a patient
with watermelon stomach disease (gastric antral vascular ectasia),
Valdez et al. (1996) cloned a DDX21 cDNA encoding a deduced 801-amino
acid protein, which they called RNA helicase II/Gu, that has a molecular
mass of approximately 100 kD and localizes to the nucleolus. They
concluded that DDX21 belongs to the DEXD box family, a variation of the
DEAD box family. The human DDX21 protein shares with its mouse
counterpart 82.1% overall sequence identity and 100% conservation in the
9 motifs conserved among RNA helicases. Using Northern blot analysis,
Valdez et al. (1996) detected a 4.5-kb DDX21 transcript in HeLa cells.
Valdez and Wang (2000) detected expression of mouse Ddx21 in liver,
testis, brain, lung, and skeletal muscle. Valdez et al. (1996) found
that DDX21 contains ATP-dependent helicase activity which preferably
translocates in the 5-prime to 3-prime direction.

By RNA dot blot analysis, Valdez et al. (2002) detected variable DDX21
expression in all normal tissues examined, and expression was
downregulated in some tumor tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation and protein pull-down analyses using biotinylated
poly I:C, Zhang et al. (2011) identified a cytosolic,
endosome-independent sensor of viral nucleotides consisting of the RNA
helicases Ddx1 (601257), Ddx21, and Dhx36 (612767) and the adaptor
molecule Trif (TICAM1; 607601) in mouse myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs).
The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensors Pkr (EIF2AK2; 176871) and Lgp2
(DHX58; 608588) were also precipitated. Knockdown of each helicase via
short hairpin RNA blocked the ability of mDCs to mount type I interferon
(see 147660) and cytokine responses to poly I:C, influenza A, and
reovirus. Ddx1 bound poly I:C through its helicase A domain, while Dhx36
and Ddx21 bound the TIR domain of Trif via their HA2-DUF and PRK
domains, respectively. Zhang et al. (2011) concluded that the
DDX1-DDX21-DHX36 complex is a dsRNA sensor that uses the TRIF pathway to
activate type I interferon responses in the cytosol of mDCs.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhu et al. (2001) determined that the DDX21 gene contains 15 exons and
spans more than 29 kb of genomic DNA. Using a luciferase-based reporter
system, they identified a minimal promoter 85 bp upstream of a
transcription start site identified using RNase protection and primer
extension.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the DDX21
gene to human chromosome 10. By FISH, Valdez and Wang (2000) mapped the
mouse Ddx21 gene to chromosome 10B4-B5.1.

By genomic sequence analysis, Valdez et al. (2002) mapped the DDX21 gene
to chromosome 10q21 near the DDX50 gene (610373). The 2 genes are in
tandem orientation and separated by 10 kb. Mouse Ddx21 and Ddx50 genes
are also tandemly oriented on mouse chromosome 10.

605918	TITLE *605918 SPONDIN 2; SPON2
;;MINDIN;;
M-SPONDIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a differential display technique, Manda et al. (1999) isolated 2
novel cDNAs, SPON2 and C20ORF1 (605917), which they designated
differentially expressed in cancerous and noncancerous lung cells-1
(DIL1) and -2 (DIL2), respectively. The full-length SPON2 cDNA encodes a
331-amino acid protein with a domain organization similar to those of
zebrafish mindin-1/mindin-2 and F-spondin (SPON1; 604989): a hydrophobic
signal sequence in the N terminus, an FS1 domain, an FS2 domain, and a
thrombospondin type I repeat. RT-PCR analysis detected no expression of
SPON2 in lung carcinoma cells. Northern blot analysis detected
expression of a 1.9-kb SPON2 transcript in various tissues, including
adult and fetal lung.

He et al. (2004) cloned mouse Spon2, which they termed mindin. The mouse
mindin protein, which is 85% identical to the human protein, is a
conserved member of a family of secreted extracellular matrix proteins.
RNA blot analysis detected expression in a variety of tissues, with
abundant expression in lung and lymphoid tissues. Immunoblot blot
analysis showed expression of a 42-kD protein under reducing conditions
and expression of dimers and oligomers in a concentration-dependent
manner under nonreducing conditions.

GENE STRUCTURE

He et al. (2004) determined that the mouse Spon2 gene contains 6 exons
spanning 5 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SPON2
gene to chromosome 4p16.3 (TMAP WI-22263).

ANIMAL MODEL

By targeted replacement of part of exon 1 and all of exons 2 and 3 of
the Spon2 gene, He et al. (2004) generated Spon2-deficient mice. These
mice had a normal appearance and life span under pathogen-free
conditions. Spon2-deficient mice were resistant to lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-induced shock, and their macrophages only produced slightly
elevated inflammatory cytokines. Addition of Spon2 to Spon2-deficient,
but not Tlr4 (603030)-deficient, macrophages restored their ability to
produce inflammatory cytokines in response to LPS. Stimuli from most
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeast also failed to induce
cytokine responses from Spon2-deficient macrophages and mast cells.
Spon2-deficient mice showed variable clearance of pathogens when
inoculated by the pulmonary and intraperitoneal routes. Fluorescence
microscopy demonstrated Spon2-dependent bacterial agglutination in the
presence of calcium due to a specific interaction with the carbohydrate
moiety of LPS and lipoteichoic acid. Phagocytosis experiments indicated
that Spon2 acts as an opsonin and pattern-recognition molecule for a
range of pathogens. He et al. (2004) proposed that Spon2 recognition of
carbohydrate structures is essential for the activation of macrophages
by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).

609448	TITLE *609448 THIOREDOXIN DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 12; TXNDC12
;;THIOREDOXIN-LIKE PROTEIN p19; TLP19;;
ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM PROTEIN, 18-KD; ERP18;;
ANTERIOR GRADIENT 1, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF; AGR1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TXNDC12 belongs to the thioredoxin superfamily (see TXN; 187700).
Members of this superfamily possess a thioredoxin fold with a consensus
active-site sequence (CxxC) and have roles in redox regulation, defense
against oxidative stress, refolding of disulfide-containing proteins,
and regulation of transcription factors (Liu et al., 2003).

CLONING

By searching genomic and EST databases for putative secretory proteins,
followed by RT-PCR of human liver RNA, Liu et al. (2003) cloned TXNDC12,
which they called TLP19. The transcript contains 2 putative poly(A)
signals in its 3-prime UTR. The deduced 172-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 19.2 kD. TLP19 has an N-terminal signal
peptide and a central thioredoxin-like domain containing the consensus
active-site motif. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.6-kb TLP19
transcript in all tissues examined, with highest expression in placenta
and liver. Placenta also expressed a 1.2-kb TLP19 transcript.
Epitope-tagged TLP19 was expressed in the Golgi apparatus of transiently
transfected COS-7 cells, and it was secreted into the culture medium.

Alanen et al. (2003) cloned TXNDC12, which they called ERP18, from a
liver cDNA library. They identified a putative C-terminal endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) retention signal (EDEL) within the deduced protein.
Alanen et al. (2003) also noted that the active-site motif of ERP18
(CGAC) is unlike the catalytic motifs of other thioredoxin superfamily
members, including thioredoxins, isomerases, and oxidating enzymes. The
overall structure of the ERP18 catalytic domain most strongly resembles
those of protein disulfide isomerases (PDI; see 176790). In contrast to
the findings of Liu et al. (2003), Alanen et al. (2003) found that
fluorescence-tagged ERP18 was retained in the ER of transfected COS-7
cells, and the staining did not overlap that of a Golgi marker.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

From circular dichroism and NMR measurements, Alanen et al. (2003)
determined that ERP18 undergoes only a minor conformational change upon
dithiol-disulfide exchange in the active site. Guanidinium chloride
denaturation curves indicated that the reduced form of the protein is
more stable than the oxidized form, suggesting that ERP18 is involved in
disulfide bond formation.

GENE FUNCTION

Liu et al. (2003) found that recombinant TLP19 without the signal
peptide showed reducing activity against an insulin-disulfide substrate.

Alanen et al. (2003) found that ERP18 showed significant peptide
thiol-disulfide oxidase activity in vitro, and the activity was
dependent on the presence of both active-site cysteines. The activity
differed from that of the human PDI family in that it was limited by
substrate oxidation and not by enzyme reoxidation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liu et al. (2003) determined that the TLP19 gene contains 7 exons and
spans more than 35 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Liu et al. (2003) mapped the TLP19 gene to
chromosome 1p32.3.

608310	TITLE *608310 ARGININOSUCCINATE LYASE; ASL
;;ARGININOSUCCINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ASL gene encodes the subunit of argininosuccinate lyase (EC 4.3.2.1)
is a urea cycle enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of argininosuccinate
to fumarate and arginine, an essential step in the process of
detoxification of ammonia via the urea cycle (O'Brien et al., 1986).

CLONING

Using antibodies specific for argininosuccinate lyase to screen a human
liver cDNA library, O'Brien et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA corresponding
to the human ASL gene. The cDNA encodes a deduced protein of 463 amino
acids with a predicted molecular mass of 52 kD, and the active enzyme is
a homotetramer. The amino acid sequence of the human enzyme shows 56%
homology to the yeast enzyme. Matuo et al. (1988) isolated clones of
human ASL cDNA and determined the nucleotide sequence. They corrected
some minor errors in the sequence reported by O'Brien et al. (1986).

Abramson et al. (1991) found that the DNA sequences encoded by exon 7
were deleted in approximately 5 to 10% of the mature mRNA in all tissue
sources examined, suggesting alternative splicing. Walker et al. (1990)
presented evidence for an alternatively spliced ASL transcript in which
exon 2 is removed.

GENE STRUCTURE

Abramson et al. (1991) demonstrated that the ASL gene contains 16 exons.
The exon structure of the gene is identical to that of the rat and
similar to that of the delta-crystallin genes in the chicken.

Linnebank et al. (2002) completed the structure and sequence of the ASL
gene and determined that it has 17 exons. The first, exon zero (0),
codes only for the 5-untranslated region.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhao et al. (2010) showed that lysine acetylation is a prevalent
modification in enzymes that catalyze intermediate metabolism in the
human liver. Virtually every enzyme in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the urea cycle, fatty acid metabolism,
and glycogen metabolism was found to be acetylated in human liver
tissue. The concentration of metabolic fuels, such as glucose, amino
acids, and fatty acids, influenced the acetylation status of metabolic
enzymes. Acetylation activated enoyl-coenzyme A
hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (607037) in fatty acid
oxidation and malate dehydrogenase (see 154200) in the TCA cycle,
inhibited argininosuccinate lyase in the urea cycle, and destabilized
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (261680) in gluconeogenesis. Zhao et
al. (2010) concluded that acetylation plays a major role in metabolic
regulation.

MAPPING

Naylor et al. (1978) assigned the gene for ASL to chromosome 7. By
analysis of genomic DNA from hamster-human cell hybrids, O'Brien et al.
(1986) assigned the ASL gene to chromosome 7. By in situ hybridization,
Todd et al. (1989) mapped ASL to 7cen-q11.2.

- Pseudogene

O'Brien et al. (1986) found that the 5-prime end of the ASL cDNA was
also hybridized to a site on chromosome 22, which the authors assumed to
be a pseudogene. Todd et al. (1989) also detected a sequence on
chromosome 22.

Linnebank et al. (2002) identified a complete ASL homolog on chromosome
22q11.2 and stated that this so-called pseudogene is a regular gene with
a promoter region, a poly-A signal, and 11 exons containing a typical
initial exon and a terminal exon. The predicted coding sequence of the
pseudogene shared more than 0.4 kb high homology with ASL cDNA. A
GenBank search with a predicted cDNA revealed that the pseudogene might
encode immunoglobulin-lambda-like mRNA (IGLL1; 146770).

Trevisson et al. (2007) identified a second ASL pseudogene located on
chromosome 7 about 3 Mb upstream of the ASL gene, close to the
centromere. There was no evidence of expression of this second
pseudogene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In fibroblasts from a patient with ASL deficiency (207900) whose parents
were consanguineous, Walker et al. (1990) identified a homozygous
mutation in the ASL gene (608310.00001).

In 27 unrelated patients with ASL deficiency, Linnebank et al. (2002)
identified 23 different mutations, 19 novel, in the ASL gene. Fifteen of
the 54 alleles had an IVS5+1G-A splice site mutation (608310.0003).

In 5 patients with a biochemical variant of ASL deficiency in which
there was residual enzyme activity and mild clinical symptoms, Kleijer
et al. (2002) identified several mutations in the ASL gene. R385C
(608310.0004), V178M (608310.0005), and R379C (608310.0006) were
detected in homozygous states, whereas 1 patient was compound
heterozygous for 2 known mutations, including Q286R (608310.0002).
Prenatal diagnosis was successfully performed in 3 of the families.

Trevisson et al. (2007) identified 16 different mutations in the ASL
gene, including 14 novel mutations, in 12 Italian patients from 10
families with ASL deficiency. All patients tested, except 1, had less
than 5% residual enzyme activity. Mutations were scattered throughout
the gene, but there were no genotype/phenotype correlations.

EVOLUTION

Piatigorsky et al. (1988) demonstrated an extraordinary similarity
between the structural protein delta-crystallin of the lens of the duck
and the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase. Delta-crystallin is the dominant
crystallin in the lenses of birds and reptiles, but is absent from
lenses of mammals. It appears that birds, being uricotelic, have
relatively little use for the metabolic enzyme but use the protein as a
structural element by producing very large amounts. Southern blot
hybridization experiments with chicken delta-crystallin cDNA and human
ASL cDNA, coupled with enzymatic tests, provided strong evidence that
the crystallin and the enzyme share genes in an unusual evolutionary
strategy. 'Gene sharing' was the designation given this phenomenon,
i.e., when 2 distinct protein phenotypes are produced by the same
transcriptional unit. Once an enzyme has been recruited to serve as a
structural protein in lens, in addition to its conserved role in
metabolism, it is subject to at least 2 independent sets of evolutionary
pressure. This may lead to sequence modifications that enhance its
function as a crystallin, or gene duplication may take place with
subsequent partial separation of function (Piatigorsky and Wistow,
1991).

ANIMAL MODEL

Erez et al. (2011) created a hypomorphic mouse model of ASL deficiency
and showed that this mouse has a distinct phenotype of multiorgan
dysfunction and nitric oxide deficiency. Administration of nitrite,
which can be converted into nitric oxide in vivo, rescued the
manifestations of nitric oxide deficiency in hypomorphic Asl mice, and a
nitric oxide synthase-independent nitric oxide donor restored nitric
oxide-dependent vascular reactivity in humans with ASL deficiency.
Mechanistic studies showed that ASL has a structural function in
addition to the catalytic activity, by which it contributes to the
formation of a multiprotein complex required for nitric oxide
production. Erez et al. (2011) concluded their data demonstrated an
unappreciated role for ASL in nitric oxide synthase function and nitric
oxide homeostasis.

Nagamani et al. (2012) performed liver-directed gene therapy in a mouse
model of argininosuccinic aciduria (ASA) to distinguish the relative
contributions of the hepatic urea cycle defect from those of the nitric
oxide deficiency in the ASA phenotype. Whereas the gene therapy
corrected the ureagenesis defect, the systemic hypertension in mice
could be corrected by treatment with an exogenous NO source.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ARGININOSUCCINIC ACIDURIA
ASL, ARG95CYS

In fibroblasts from a patient with late-onset ASL deficiency (207900)
who was the product of a consanguineous mating, Walker et al. (1990)
identified a homozygous 283C-T change in exon 3 of the ASL gene,
resulting in an arg95-to-cys (R95C) substitution within a 13-residue
stretch that is identical in yeast and human ASL. Enzyme activity of the
mutant protein was about 1%.

.0002
ARGININOSUCCINIC ACIDURIA
ASL, GLN286ARG

In a cell line from a patient with neonatal-onset of argininosuccinic
aciduria (207900) whose parents were consanguineous, Walker et al.
(1990) identified an 857A-G transition in exon 11 of the ASL gene,
resulting in a gln286-to-arg (Q286R) substitution. The mutation occurred
in a region of 18 amino acids identical in yeast and human ASL, and in a
region of 10 amino acids highly conserved in the family of class II
fumarases. The mutant enzyme retained less than 3% of residual ASL
activity.

identified a homozygous 1135C-T transition in the ASL gene, resulting in
an arg379-to-cys (R379C) substitution.

602209	TITLE *602209 RAS-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN 1; RREB1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In several neuroendocrine cell types, the RAS/RAF signal transduction
cascade results in cell differentiation (see HRAS; 190020). This signal
transduction cascade involves inactivation of several tiers of protein
kinases, including members of the RAF (e.g., RAF1; 164760), MAPKK, and
MAPK families (see 176872). Ultimately, activation of these protein
kinases results in the activation of transcription factors responsible
for changes in cell phenotype. In the human medullary thyroid carcinoma
cell line TT, an activated HRAS oncogene or activation of the RAF1 gene
induces a program of neuroendocrine differentiation (Carson et al.,
1995). One of the hallmarks of this differentiation process is an
increase in the expression of the calcitonin gene (114130). Thiagalingam
et al. (1996) reported the DNA affinity cloning of a RAS-responsive
element binding protein, RREB1, from the TT cell line. RREB1, a zinc
finger transcription factor, was shown to bind specifically to the
distal RAS-responsive element (RRE) in the calcitonin gene promoter and
to augment the RAS/RAF-mediated transcriptional response of that
promoter. Thus, they concluded that it may be involved in
RAS/RAF-mediated cell differentiation.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a promoter pull-down assay followed by mass spectrometry analysis,
Flajollet et al. (2009) identified RREB1 as a protein that bound the
HLA-G (142871) promoter. RREB1 exerted repressive activity on the
promoter in HLA-G-negative cells that was mediated by recruitment of
HDAC1 (601241) and CTBP1 (602618) and/or CTBP2 (602619). CTBP1 and CTBP2
are subunits of the C-terminal binding protein (CTBP) complex, a
corepressor involved in chromatin remodeling. The HLA-G promoter
contains 3 RREB1 target sites. Flajollet et al. (2009) proposed that the
repressive activity of RREB1 on the HLA-G promoter may be regulated by
posttranslational modifications governing its association with CTBP.

MAPPING

Thiagalingam et al. (1997) mapped the RREB1 gene to 6p25 by 3 mapping
methods: PCR analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, analysis of the
Stanford G3 radiation hybrid mapping panel, and fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

607582	TITLE *607582 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 22 (ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 6; SLC22A6
;;ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER 1; OAT1;;
PARA-AMINOHIPPURATE TRANSPORTER; PAHT;;
PAH TRANSPORTER
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SLC22A6 is a member of a family of organic anion transporters. Within
renal proximal tubules, these transporters mediate the secretion of
endogenous and exogenous metabolites, including many clinically
important drugs.

CLONING

Using the sequence of the rat PAH transporter as query, Lu et al. (1999)
identified fetal brain ESTs for SLC22A6, which they designated PAHT.
They obtained the full-length clone by RT-PCR of adult kidney mRNA. The
deduced 550-amino acid protein contains 12 transmembrane spans, 4
protein kinase C (see 176960) phosphorylation sites, 4 protein kinase A
(see 176911) phosphorylation sites, and 5 putative N-glycosylation
sites. SLC22A6 shares 87% identity with rat Oat1, 85% identity with
mouse Oat1, and 32% and 29% identity with the cation transporters OCT1
(SLC22A1; 602607) and OCTN2 (SLC22A5; 603377), respectively. Northern
blot analysis of several tissues detected a 2.4-kb transcript only in
kidney.

Race et al. (1999) cloned SLC22A6, which they designated OAT1, from a
kidney cDNA library. The deduced protein has a calculated molecular mass
of 60.3 kD. SLC22A6 has 12 transmembrane-spanning domains that are
separated by 5 intracellular loops and 6 extracellular loops; the N and
C termini are intracellular. SLC22A6 also contains 3 motifs conserved in
the amphiphilic solute facilitator family of proteins. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.4-kb transcript expressed strongly in kidney and
weakly in brain.

Bahn et al. (2000) identified a splice variant of OAT1 that has a 132-bp
in-frame deletion, resulting in the loss of transmembrane domain 11 and
half of transmembrane domain 12.

GENE FUNCTION

By analyzing PAHT transiently expressed in HeLa cells, Lu et al. (1999)
demonstrated time-dependent and saturable radiolabeled PAH uptake.
Preincubation with unlabeled alpha-ketoglutaric or with glutaric acid
stimulated PAH uptake, and preincubation with unlabeled PAH stimulated
uptake of radiolabeled alpha-ketoglutarate, consistent with
PAH/alpha-ketoglutarate exchange. Transport of radiolabeled PAH was
inhibited by furosemide, indomethacin, probenecid, and
alpha-ketoglutarate. It was not inhibited by prostaglandins or
methotrexate, indicating substrate specificity that is different than
that of rat Oat1. PAH uptake was also inhibited by phorbol esters in a
dose- and time-dependent fashion, indicating inhibition of transport by
phosphorylation through protein kinase C.

Race et al. (1999) demonstrated PAH uptake in Xenopus oocytes injected
with OAT1 mRNA. PAH uptake was dependent on chloride. Inhibitor studies
gave results similar to those reported by Lu et al. (1999).

GENE STRUCTURE

Bahn et al. (2000) determined that the SLC22A6 gene contains 10 exons
and spans 8.2 kb. The promoter region contains TATA and CCAAT boxes, a
thyroid hormone-binding site, and putative binding sites for nuclear
factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011), AP2 (107580), C/EBP-alpha (116897),
and SP1 (189906).

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid analysis, Lu et al. (1999) mapped the SLC22A6
gene to chromosome 11. By radiation hybrid analysis, Race et al. (1999)
mapped the SLC22A6 gene to chromosome 11. Bahn et al. (2000) mapped the
SLC22A6 gene to chromosome 11q13.1-q13.2 using FISH.

600007	TITLE *600007 FMS-RELATED TYROSINE KINASE 3 LIGAND; FLT3LG
;;FLT3 LIGAND; FL; FLT3L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dendritic cells (DCs) provide the key link between innate and adaptive
immunity by recognizing pathogens and priming pathogen-specific immune
responses. FLT3LG controls the development of DCs and is particularly
important for plasmacytoid DCs and CD8 (see 186910)-positive classical
DCs and their CD103 (ITGAE; 604682)-positive tissue counterparts
(summary by Sathaliyawala et al., 2010).

CLONING

FMS-related tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3; 136351) is a tyrosine kinase
receptor structurally related to macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(CSF1; 120420) and to mast cell growth factor receptor (KIT; 164920).
From a murine T-cell line, Lyman et al. (1993) cloned a novel
hematopoietic growth factor that is a ligand for FLT3. Lyman et al.
(1994) used a fragment of the murine cDNA to clone the human FLT3
ligand, which is similar in structure to the murine protein and shares
72% amino acid identity. Northern blot analysis showed widespread
expression of FLT3 ligand mRNA transcripts in human tissues.

Hannum et al. (1994) isolated a soluble protein that showed FL activity
from medium conditioned by mouse thymic stromal cells. By sequencing
peptides and screening thymic stromal cell lines, they cloned splice
variants of mouse and human FL. The deduced 235- and 245-amino acid
human isoforms differ in their C-terminal segments, with the shorter
protein containing a unique transmembrane domain. The N terminus of both
isoforms contains a signal peptide followed by a cytokine domain related
to KIT ligand (KITLG; 184745) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(CSF1; 120420). The cytokine domain also has N-glycosylation sites.
Northern blot analysis showed widespread expression in mouse and human
tissues, with highest levels in spleen and lung. The major human
transcript was 1.6 kb. High expression was also detected in mouse and
human stromal cell lines, with highest levels in T-cell lines and
peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Lyman et al. (1993) found that Flt3 ligand stimulated proliferation of
hematopoietic progenitor cells isolated from mouse fetal liver or adult
mouse bone marrow.

Hannum et al. (1994) showed that transfection of COS cells with mouse
and human FL containing the C-terminal transmembrane domain resulted in
secretion of a soluble protein with FL activity. Assays of C-terminally
truncated FL proteins confirmed that the N-terminal half conferred FL
activity. Recombinant protein produced by either mouse fibroblasts or E.
coli induced tyrosine autophosphorylation of Flt3 on mouse cells. The
purified protein enhanced the response of mouse stem cells and primitive
human progenitor cells to other growth factors, such as IL3 (147740),
IL6 (147620), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(CSF2; 138960), and it also stimulated fetal thymocytes. Hannum et al.
(1994) concluded that FL enhances the response of stem and primitive
progenitor cells to other growth factors to generate all myeloid
lineages except erythroid cells.

Sathaliyawala et al. (2010) found that the Mtor (FRAP1; 601231)
inhibitor rapamycin impaired mouse Flt3l-driven DC development in vitro,
with plasmacytoid DCs and classical DCs most profoundly affected.
Depletion of the Pi3k (see 601232)-Mtor negative regulator Pten (601728)
facilitated Flt3l-driven DC development in culture. Targeting Pten in
DCs in vivo caused expansion of Cd8-positive and Cd103-positive
classical DCs, which could be reversed by rapamycin. Increased
Cd8-positive classical DC numbers caused by Pten deletion correlated
with increased susceptibility to Listeria infection. Sathaliyawala et
al. (2010) concluded that PI3K-MTOR signaling downstream of FLT3L
controls DC development, and that restriction by PTEN ensures optimal DC
numbers and subset composition.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ikaros proteins are lymphoid-restricted zinc finger transcription
factors that are considered master regulators of lymphocyte
differentiation. Klug et al. (1998) noted that there are at least 8
alternatively spliced transcripts of the Ikaros gene that encode
isoforms with common N-terminal and C-terminal domains. By screening a
Jurkat T-cell cDNA library with a mouse Ikaros cDNA, Molnar et al.
(1996) isolated human Ikaros cDNAs. The deduced human and mouse Ikaros
proteins are 95% identical. RT-PCR of human thymus and peripheral blood
leukocyte mRNAs detected 6 Ikaros splicing variants which were expressed
at similar levels and ratios as the corresponding mouse leukocyte Ikaros
transcripts. The authors found that Ikaros proteins are conserved in
sequence composition and relative expression between human T cells and
mouse thymocytes. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the expression of
7.5- and 4.5-kb Ikaros transcripts in human thymus, spleen, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

By PCR using primers based on a conserved nucleotide sequence of various
zinc finger proteins, Nietfeld and Meyerhans (1996) cloned human bone
marrow cDNAs encoding Ikaros, which they designated IK1. The deduced
519-amino acid protein is 93% identical to the mouse Ikaros isoform
1/LyF1 isoform VI and contains 4 N-terminal and 2 C-terminal zinc finger
domains. The authors detected 3 human mRNA species by Northern blot
analysis: a 4.4-kb transcript, which was prominent in peripheral blood
leukocytes; a 6.0-kb transcript, which was strongly expressed in spleen,
thymus, lymph node, and bone marrow; and a 7.0-kb transcript. They
stated that the human and mouse Ikaros genes have similar overall
transcription patterns.

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the N-terminal Kruppel-like zinc finger
domain of Ikaros proteins is involved in DNA binding, while the
C-terminal zinc finger domain mediates homo- or heterodimerization with
other Ikaros proteins. Alternative splicing of exons 3 to 6 produces
Ikaros isoforms with 0 to 4 N-terminal zinc fingers, and those with at
least 3 efficiently bind DNA. The DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms include
IK1, IK2, IK3, and IKX, and IK4 can bind DNA on palindromic sequences.
IK5, IK6, IK7, and IK8 are considered dominant-negative isoforms due to
their capacity to bind other isoforms and their inefficiency in binding
DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Harker et al. (2002) showed that Ikaros may play an important role in
CD4 (186940) versus CD8 (see CD8A; 186910) lineage commitment decisions
by demonstrating: (1) that it binds to regulatory elements in the
endogenous CD8A locus in vivo using thymocyte chromatin
immunoprecipitations; (2) that Ikaros suppresses position effect
variegation of transgenes driven by CD8 regulatory elements; and (3)
that mice with reduced levels of Ikaros and Aiolos (606221) show an
apparent increase in CD4 populations with immature phenotype, i.e.,
cells that fail to activate the CD8A gene. The authors proposed that
Ikaros family members function as activators of the CD8A gene and that
their associated activities are critical for appropriate chromatin
remodeling transitions during thymocyte differentiation and lineage
commitment.

Ezzat et al. (2005) demonstrated that Ikaros is expressed in the
hormone-producing pituitary corticomelanotroph cells of mice, where it
binds the proopiomelanocortin promoter and regulates endogenous gene
expression. Ikaros-null mice had contraction of the pituitary
corticomelanotroph population, reduced circulating adrenocorticotrophic
hormone levels, and adrenal glucocorticoid insufficiency. Hematopoietic
reconstitution failed to correct this hormonal deficit, but the
phenotype of reduced body weight and diminished survival was rescued by
systemic glucocorticoid-hormone administration. Ezzat et al. (2005)
concluded that Ikaros plays a role in orchestrating immune-endocrine
development and function.

Yap et al. (2005) identified Ikaros-binding elements in the 5-prime
flanking regions of pufferfish, mouse, and human STAT4 (600558).
Transactivation, electrophoretic mobility shift, and RNA interference
analyses showed that Ikaros bound to the STAT4 promoter and was involved
in regulation of STAT4 in human T cells.

Dijon et al. (2008) found that purified CD34 (142230)-positive human
cord blood cells and adult peripheral blood cells that were cultured
under erythroid conditions expressed the DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms IK1
through IK4, but not the dominant-negative isoform IK6.
Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that expression of IK6 in these
cells resulted in complex formation between IK6 and IK1, and IK6
decreased cell number and increased cell death. IK6 overexpression
disturbed erythroid differentiation and expression of erythroid-specific
genes, although it had no effect on Ikaros expression, and favored
myelopoiesis by promoting expression of myeloid-specific genes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the IKZF1 gene contains 7 translated
exons.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid DNAs, Molnar et al. (1996) mapped the human
Ikaros gene to 7p13-p11.1, near the EGFR gene (131550). They mapped the
mouse Ikaros gene to chromosome 11 by interspecific backcross analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ikaros is required for normal lymphocyte development. Germline mutant
mice that express only non-DNA-binding dominant-negative 'leukemogenic'
Ikaros isoforms lacking critical N-terminal zinc fingers develop an
aggressive form of lymphoblastic leukemia 3 to 6 months after birth (see
'Animal Model' below). These facts prompted Sun et al. (1999) to seek
molecular abnormalities involving the Ikaros gene in acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL2; 613067) in infants. In leukemic cells from 12 ALL
infants less than 1 year of age, Sun et al. (1999) found high-level
expression of dominant-negative isoforms of Ikaros with abnormal
subcellular compartmentalization patterns. PCR cloning and nucleotide
sequencing were used to identify the specific Ikaros isoforms and detect
Ikaros gene mutations in these cells. Leukemic cells from 7 of 7 infants
with ALL, including 5 of 5 MLL-AF4-positive (159557) infants, expressed
dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms IK4, IK7, and IK8 that lack critical
N-terminal zinc fingers. In 6 of 7 patients, Sun et al. (1999) detected
an in-frame deletion of 10 amino acids (KSSMPQKFLG) upstream of the
transcription-activation domain adjacent to the C-terminal zinc fingers
of IK2, IK4, IK7, and IK8. In contrast, only wildtype IK1 and IK2
isoforms with normal nuclear localization were found in normal infant
bone marrow cells and infant thymocytes. These results implicated the
expression of dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms and the disruption of
normal Ikaros function in the leukemogenesis of ALL in infants.

Nakase et al. (2000) found overexpression of the dominant-negative IK6
isoform in 14 of 41 B-cell patients with adult B-cell ALL. None of the
other dominant-negative isoforms of the Ikaros gene were detected by
RT-PCR analysis. Southern blot analysis with PstI digestion revealed
that those patients with the dominant-negative IK6 isoform might have
small mutations in the Ikaros locus. The results suggested that Ikaros
plays a key role in human B-cell malignancies through the
dominant-negative isoform IK6.

Using RT-PCR to detect Ikaros isoforms with the 30-base deletion in exon
6, Payne et al. (2001) showed that transcripts for IK1 and IK1 with the
deletion were present in normal cord blood and bone marrow, as well as
in 3 ALL cell lines. In addition, they identified an isoform, IKX, that
was identical to IK3 except that it included exon 6; IKX was generated
from a novel exon combination with and without the 30-base deletion.
Payne et al. (2001) detected multiple DNA-binding and nonbinding
isoforms with a 60-base insertion linked to leukemia expressed at the
RNA level in normal hemopoietic cells. Immunoblot analysis indicated
that the predominant isoform in normal cells is IKX, while the
predominant form in leukemic cells is IK1.

In a genomewide analysis of leukemic cells from 242 pediatric ALL
patients using high resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
arrays and genomic DNA sequencing, Mullighan et al. (2007) identified
mutations in genes encoding principal regulators of B-lymphocyte
development and differentiation in 40% of B-progenitor ALL cases.
Deletions were detected in IKZF1, IKZF3 (606221),TCF3 (147141), EBF1
(164343), and LEF1 (153245). The PAX5 (167414) gene was the most
frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7% of cases.

The Philadelphia chromosome, a chromosomal abnormality that encodes
BCR-ABL1 (see 151410, 189980), is the defining lesion of chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL). To define oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to
induce ALL, Mullighan et al. (2008) performed a genomewide analysis of
diagnostic leukemia samples from 304 individuals with ALL, including 43
BCR-ABL1 B-progenitor ALLs and 23 CML cases. IKZF1, encoding the
transcription factor Ikaros, was deleted in 83.7% of BCR-ABL1 ALL, but
not in chronic phase CML. Deletion of IKZF1 was also identified as an
acquired lesion at the time of transformation of CML to ALL (lymphoid
blast crisis). The IKZF1 deletions resulted in haploinsufficiency,
expression of a dominant-negative Ikaros isoform, or the complete loss
of Ikaros expression. Sequencing of IKZF1 deletion breakpoints suggested
that aberrant RAG-mediated recombination (see 179615) is responsible for
the deletions. Mullighan et al. (2008) concluded that genetic lesions
resulting in the loss of Ikaros function are an important event in the
development of BCR-ABL1 ALL.

Mullighan et al. (2009) identified deletions involving the IKZF1 gene in
leukemic cells of 63 (28.6%) of 221 children with B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. Cells from 20 patients had a deletion of coding
exons 3 through 6, resulting in the expression of a dominant-negative
form of IKZF1. IKZF1 deletions were associated with an increased risk of
relapse and adverse effects in the original cohort and in an independent
cohort of 258 patients (p values ranging from less than 0.001 to 0.004).

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
IKZF1 gene and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, see ALL2 (613067).

CYTOGENETICS

The BCL6 gene (109565), isolated from the breakpoints of 3q27-associated
chromosomal translocations, is implicated in diffuse large B-cell
lymphomas (DLBL). Hosokawa et al. (2000) described the molecular
characterization of novel t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations in 2 patients
with DLBL. Molecular genetic analysis of the breakpoint area involving
BCL6 revealed the presence of the Ikaros gene. As a molecular
consequence of the translocation, the 5-prime regulatory region of BCL6
was replaced by the putative 5-prime regulatory region of the Ikaros
gene, probably leading to deregulated expression of the BCL6 gene
throughout B-cell differentiation. RT-PCR and FISH analyses of a patient
sample established that the translocation resulted in fusion of the
Ikaros and BCL6 genes. The clinical features of the 2 patients with DLBL
and t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations were reported by Ichinohasama et al.
(1998).

ANIMAL MODEL

Mice homozygous for a germline mutation in the Ikaros DNA-binding domain
lack not only T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, but also
their earliest defined progenitors (Georgopoulos et al., 1994). In
contrast, the erythroid and myeloid lineages are intact in these mutant
mice. Klug et al. (1998) showed that the DNA-binding isoforms of mouse
Ikaros are localized in the nucleus of the most primitive hematopoietic
stem cell subset. They found that Ikaros localizes to heterochromatin in
Abelson-transformed pre-B lymphocytes. Changes in the RNA splicing
pattern of Ikaros occurred at 2 stages of lymphoid differentiation.

O'Neill et al. (1999, 2000) described the structure of a chromatin
remodeling complex associated with Ikaros that is present only in adult
hematopoietic cells. This complex binds to Ikaros-like DNA-binding
sites, including a long polypyrimidine-rich sequence upstream of the
human delta-globin gene (142000), and was thus called PYR complex.
Deletion of this sequence in a human beta locus-containing cosmid
(carrying sequences from the human gamma-A gene, 142200, through the
adult beta-globin gene, 141900) in transgenic mice resulted in delayed
switching from gamma-globin to beta-globin. Lopez et al. (2002) showed
that homozygous Ikaros-null mice lacked the PYR complex, demonstrating a
requirement for Ikaros in the formation of the complex on DNA.
Heterozygous Ikaros-null mice had about half as much PYR complex,
indicating a dosage effect for both Ikaros and PYR complex. They also
showed that Ikaros-null mice had multiple hematopoietic cell defects,
including anemia and megakaryocytic abnormalities, in addition to
lymphoid and stem cell defects. The null mice also had a delay in murine
embryonic-to-adult beta-globin switching and a delay in human
gamma-to-beta switching, consistent with the suggested role for PYR
complex in this process. Lastly, cDNA array analyses indicated that
several hematopoietic cell-specific genes in all blood lineages were
either up- or downregulated in 14-day embryos from Ikaros-null mice
compared with wildtype mice. These results indicated that Ikaros and PYR
complex function together in vivo at many adult hematopoietic
cell-specific genes and at intergenic sites, affecting their expression
and leading to pleiotropic hematopoietic defects.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are specialized dendritic cells that
produce high levels of type I interferon (see IFNA1; 147660) upon viral
infection. Allman et al. (2006) showed that mice expressing low levels
of Ikaros lacked peripheral plasmacytoid dendritic cells but not other
dendritic cell subsets. Loss of plasmacytoid dendritic cells was
associated with inability to produce type I interferon after challenge
with Tlr7 (300365) or Tlr9 (605474) ligands or murine cytomegalovirus.
Conventional dendritic cells were present in normal numbers and
exhibited normal responses to in vivo challenge with murine
cytomegalovirus or inactivated toxoplasma antigen.

609846	TITLE *609846 REGENERATING ISLET-DERIVED FAMILY, MEMBER 4; REG4
;;REG IV
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

From high-throughput sequence analysis of a large inflammatory bowel
disease cDNA library, Hartupee et al. (2001) identified a novel member
of the regenerating (REG) gene family, which they designated REG IV. The
REG4 gene encodes a deduced 158-amino acid protein with an N-terminal
signal peptide of 22 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 18.2
kD. REG4 maintains conservation of the 6 cysteine residues present in
other known members of the REG family. By Northern blot analysis of
intestinal mucosa from 12 individuals with inflammatory bowel disease,
Hartupee et al. (2001) identified a 1.1-kb REG4 transcript in all
samples. Control specimens had low but detectable expression of REG4.
REG4 expression was significantly upregulated by inflammation and tissue
injury associated with active Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. RNA
dot-blot analysis showed that most of the tissues expressing REG4 are in
the gastrointestinal tract, i.e., colon, small intestine, stomach, and
pancreas.

Using real-time PCR, Violette et al. (2003) found higher levels of REG4
expression in normal small intestine than in normal colon, and barely
detectable REG4 expression in normal pancreas.

By in situ hybridization experiments on small intestine, Violette et al.
(2003) found that some cells in the epithelium, in crypts and villi,
express REG4. REG4 mRNA was located at the basal perinuclear zone of
goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells were strongly stained.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Northern blot analysis, Violette et al. (2003) demonstrated high
levels of REG4 mRNA in 4 of 6 drug-resistant human colorectal cancer
cell lines, but very little or no REG4 mRNA is 2 drug-sensitive cell
lines. Furthermore, 77% (10/13) of colorectal tumors displayed a higher
level of REG4 mRNA than normal colon mucosa specimens. Real-time PCR
showed stronger expression of REG4 in 68% (16/22) of colorectal tumor
samples analyzed when compared with normal colon. The level of REG4 mRNA
varied within a range of 4 orders of magnitude between the different
tumors. Unlike REG4, 3 other REG genes (REG1A, 167700; REG1B, 167771;
REG3A, 167805) were present at low or undetectable levels in most tumor
samples. Violette et al. (2003) found no significant relationship
between the presence of REG4 transcripts or the increase in REG4
expression and the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) state of tumors or their
localization. However, most of the colorectal tumors overexpressing REG4
were mucinous tumors or neuroendocrine tumors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hartupee et al. (2001) determined that the REG4 gene contains 6 exons
and that the exon structure is preserved among members of the REG gene
family.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Hartupee et al. (2001) mapped the REG4 gene to
chromosome 1.

AMPK-GAMMA-1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The mammalian 5-prime-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) appears to act
as a metabolic stress-sensing protein kinase. AMPK is a heterotrimeric
protein composed of a catalytic alpha subunit, a noncatalytic beta
subunit, and a noncatalytic gamma subunit. See PRKAA1 (602739) for
background.

CLONING

By PCR with degenerate oligonucleotides based on the rat Ampk-gamma-1
protein sequence, Woods et al. (1996) isolated rat liver cDNAs encoding
Ampk-gamma-1. Both the Ampk-gamma-1 mRNA and protein are widely
expressed in rat tissues. Gao et al. (1996) screened a human fetal liver
cDNA library with the rat Ampk-gamma-1 cDNA and isolated a cDNA encoding
AMPK-gamma-1. The predicted 331-amino acid human protein has a mass of
37.5 kD by SDS-PAGE.

GENE FUNCTION

By site-directed mutagenesis, Hamilton et al. (2001) introduced an
arg70-to-glu mutation into PRKAG1. The mutation caused a marked increase
in AMPK activity, and the activity was largely AMP-independent.
Activation was associated with increased threonine phosphorylation
within the activation loop of the alpha subunit, PRKAA1. There was also
increased phosphorylation of one of its major substrates, acetyl-CoA
carboxylase (200350).

Minokoshi et al. (2004) investigated the potential role of AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) in the hypothalamus in the regulation of food
intake. Minokoshi et al. (2004) reported that AMPK activity is inhibited
in arcuate and paraventricular hypothalamus by the anorexigenic hormone
leptin (164160), and in multiple hypothalamic regions by insulin
(176730), high glucose, and refeeding. A melanocortin receptor (see
155555) agonist, a potent anorexigen, decreased AMPK activity in
paraventricular hypothalamus, whereas agouti-related protein (602311),
an orexigen, increased AMPK activity. Melanocortin receptor signaling is
required for leptin and refeeding effects of AMPK in the paraventricular
hypothalamus. Dominant-negative AMPK expression in the hypothalamus was
sufficient to reduce food intake and body weight, whereas constitutively
active AMPK increased both. Alterations of hypothalamic AMPK activity
augmented changes in arcuate neuropeptide expression induced by fasting
and feeding. Furthermore, inhibition of hypothalamic AMPK is necessary
for leptin's effects on food intake and body weight, as constitutively
active AMPK blocks these effects. Thus, Minokoshi et al. (2004)
concluded that hypothalamic AMPK plays a critical role in hormonal and
nutrient-derived anorexigenic and orexigenic signals and in energy
balance.

Baba et al. (2006) showed that FNIP1 (610594) interacted with the alpha,
beta, and gamma subunits of AMPK. FNIP1 was phosphorylated by AMPK, and
its phosphorylation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by an AMPK
inhibitor, resulting in reduced FNIP1 expression. FLCN (607273)
phosphorylation was diminished by rapamycin and amino acid starvation
and facilitated by FNIP1 overexpression, suggesting that FLCN
phosphorylation may be regulated by mTOR (FRAP1; 601231) and AMPK
signaling. Baba et al. (2006) concluded that FLCN and FNIP1 may be
involved in energy and/or nutrient sensing through the AMPK and mTOR
signaling pathways.

AMPK is an alpha-beta-gamma heterotrimer activated by decreasing
concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and increasing AMP
concentrations (summary by Oakhill et al., 2011). AMPK activation
depends on phosphorylation of the alpha catalytic subunit on thr172 by
kinases LKB1 (602216) or CaMKK-beta (CAMMK2; 615002), and this is
promoted by AMP binding to the gamma subunit. AMP sustains activity by
inhibiting dephosphorylation of alpha-thr172, whereas ATP promotes
dephosphorylation. Oakhill et al. (2011) found that adenosine
diphosphate (ADP), like AMP, bound to gamma sites 1 and 3 and stimulated
alpha-Thr172 phosphorylation. However, in contrast to AMP, ADP did not
directly activate phosphorylated AMPK. In this way, both ADP/ATP and
AMP/ATP ratios contribute to AMPK regulation.

MAPPING

Stapleton et al. (1997) mapped the human AMPK-gamma-1 gene to 12q13.1 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Xiao et al. (2007) reported the crystal structure of the regulatory
fragment of mammalian AMPK in complexes with AMP and ATP. The phosphate
groups of AMP/ATP lie in a groove on the surface of the gamma domain,
which is lined with basic residues, many of which are associated with
disease-causing mutations. Structural and solution studies revealed that
2 sites on the gamma domain bind either AMP or magnesium ATP, whereas a
third site contains a tightly bound AMP that does not exchange. Xiao et
al. (2007) stated that their binding studies indicated that under
physiologic conditions AMPK mainly exists in its inactive form in
complex with magnesium ATP, which is much more abundant than AMP. Their
modeling studies suggested how changes in the concentration of AMP
enhance AMPK activity levels. The structure also suggested a mechanism
for propagating AMP/ATP signaling whereby a phosphorylated residue from
the alpha and/or beta subunits binds to the gamma subunit in the
presence of AMP but not when ATP is bound.

;;GREMLIN;;
CYSTINE KNOT SUPERFAMILY 1, BMP ANTAGONIST 1; CKTSF1B1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a Xenopus expression-cloning screen, Hsu et al. (1998) isolated
GREM1, an antagonist of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP; see 112264)
signaling that is expressed in the neural crest. Gremlin-1 belongs to a
novel gene family that includes the head-inducing factor cerberus (CER1;
603777) and the tumor suppressor DAN (600613). Hsu et al. (1998) showed
that all family members are secreted proteins and that they act as BMP
antagonists in embryonic explants. They also provided support for the
model that gremlin, cerberus, and DAN block BMP signaling by binding
BMPs, preventing them from interacting with their receptors. They
proposed that gremlin, cerberus, and DAN control diverse processes in
growth and development by selectively antagonizing the activities of
different subsets of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta ligands.
By homology searches, Hsu et al. (1998) cloned the human homolog of
Xenopus gremlin. The human gremlin cDNA encodes a predicted 184-amino
acid protein.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, Topol et al.
(2000) mapped the GREM1 gene to human chromosome 15q13-q15.

GENE FUNCTION

Zuniga et al. (1999) reported that the secreted BMP antagonist gremlin
relays the Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) signal from the polarizing
region to the apical ectodermal ridge. Mesenchymal gremlin expression is
lost in limb buds of mouse embryos homozygous for the 'limb deformity'
(ld) mutation, which disrupts establishment of the Shh/Fgf4 (164980)
feedback loop. Grafting gremlin-expressing cells into ld mutant limb
buds rescued Fgf4 expression and restored the Shh/Fgf4 feedback loop.
Analysis of Shh-null mutant embryos revealed that Shh signaling is
required for maintenance of gremlin and formin (FMN1; 136535), the gene
disrupted by the ld mutations. In contrast, formin, gremlin, and Fgf4
activation were independent of Shh signaling. Zuniga et al. (1999)
concluded that the study uncovered the cascade by which the SHH signal
is relayed from the posterior mesenchyme to the apical ectodermal ridge
and established that formin-dependent activation of the BMP antagonist
gremlin is sufficient to induce Fgf4 and establish the SHH/Fgf4 feedback
loop.

Vertebrate limb outgrowth is driven by a positive feedback loop
involving SHH, gremlin, and FGF4. By overexpressing individual
components of the loop at a time after these genes are normally
downregulated in chicken embryos, Scherz et al. (2004) found that Shh no
longer maintains gremlin in the posterior limb. Shh-expressing cells and
their descendants cannot express gremlin. The proliferation of these
descendants forms a barrier separating the Shh signal from
gremlin-expressing cells, which breaks down the Shh-Fgf4 loop and
thereby affects limb size and provides a mechanism explaining regulative
properties of the limb bud.

Developmentally regulated programmed cell death sculpts the limbs and
other embryonic organs in vertebrates. In chickens and mice, Bmps
trigger apoptosis of the interdigital mesenchyme, leading to freed
digits, whereas in ducks, Bmp antagonists inhibit the apoptotic program,
resulting in webbed feet. Weatherbee et al. (2006) found the bat C.
perspicillata utilizes a unique combination of high Fgf8 (600483) and
gremlin expression to maintain interdigit tissue in the forelimb,
resulting in simultaneously elevated Fgf signaling and inhibited Bmp
signaling.

Wordinger et al. (2007) studied the effects of altered BMP signaling on
intraocular pressure (IOP) in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG; see
137760). They found that the human trabecular meshwork (TM) synthesized
and secreted BMP4 (112262) as well as expressed the BMP receptor
subtypes BMPR1 (see 601299) and BMPR2 (600799). TM cells responded to
exogenous BMP4 by phosphorylating SMAD signaling proteins (see 601595).
Cultured human TM cells treated with TGFB2 (190220) significantly
increased fibronectin (FN; 135600) levels, and BMP4 blocked this FN
induction. There was significant elevation of mRNA and protein levels of
the BMP antagonist gremlin in glaucomatous TM cells. In addition,
gremlin was present in human aqueous humor. Gremlin blocked the negative
effect of BMP4 on TGFB2 induction of FN. Addition of recombinant gremlin
to the medium of ex vivo perfusion-cultured human eye anterior segments
caused the glaucoma phenotype of elevated IOP. Wordinger et al. (2007)
concluded that these results were consistent with the hypothesis that,
in POAG, elevated expression of gremlin by TM cells inhibited BMP4
antagonism of TGFB2 and led to increased extracellular matrix deposition
and elevated IOP.

Limb development is regulated by epithelial-mesenchymal feedback loops
between SHH and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling involving the
bone morphogenetic protein antagonist gremlin-1. By combining mouse
molecular genetics with mathematical modeling, Benazet et al. (2009)
showed that BMP4 first initiates and SHH then propagates
epithelial-mesenchymal feedback signaling through differential
transcriptional regulation of Grem1 to control digit specification. This
switch occurs by linking a fast BMP4/GREM1 module to the slower
SHH/GREM1/FGF epithelial-mesenchymal feedback loop. This self-regulatory
signaling network results in robust regulation of distal limb
development that is able to compensate for variations by
interconnectivity among the 3 signaling pathways.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 8 Ashkenazi Jewish families segregating autosomal
dominant hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome mapping to chromosome
15q13.3 (HMPS1; 601228), Jaeger et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity
for an approximately 40-kb duplication centered on chr. 15:30.77 Mb that
was not found in 188 unselected Ashkenazi controls or in 935 controls
from the Colorectal Tumour Gene Identification (CORGI) study. PCR
amplification across the duplication breakpoints mapped it to chr.
15:30,752,231-30,792,051 (NCBI36), and the change was found to be a
simple tandem tail-head duplication with insertion of a 30-bp sequence
of unknown origin that had no homology to known sequences between the
duplicons. The duplication extended from intron 2 of the SCG5 gene to a
site just upstream of the GREM1 CpG island; however, only the normal
SCG5 mRNA species was found, and there were no significant differences
in SCG5 expression compared to controls. In contrast, markedly increased
GREM1 transcript levels were detected in the normal epithelium of HMPS
patients compared to controls, and allele-specific expression analysis
showed significantly increased expression of the duplicated allele in
HMPS crypts. In normal colorectal crypts of controls and unaffected
relatives, GREM1 expression was restricted to intestinal subepithelial
myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) at the crypt base, whereas in normal colorectal
crypts of HMPS patients, GREM1 was expressed not only in basal ISEMFs
but also at very high levels in epithelial cells, predominantly
colonocytes, with expression extending most of the way up the sides of
the crypts. Increased GREM1 expression was also seen in HMPS polyps, but
to a lesser extent than in normal epithelium. Jaeger et al. (2012)
demonstrated that a 3-kb region within the duplication (chr.
15:30,779,000-30,782,000, NCBI36) enhanced GREM1 expression 4-fold in
the SW948 CRC cell line and that the region interacts directly with the
GREM1 promoter. Increased GREM1 expression was predicted to cause
reduced BMP (see 112264) pathway activity, a mechanism that also
underlies tumorigenesis in juvenile polyposis of the large bowel
(174900).

ANIMAL MODEL

During limb outgrowth, signaling by BMPs must be moderated to maintain
the signaling loop between the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) and the
apical ectodermal ridge (AER). Gremlin, an extracellular BMP antagonist,
has been proposed to fulfill this function and therefore be important in
limb patterning. Khokha et al. (2003) tested this model directly by
mutating the mouse gene encoding gremlin. In the mutant limb, the
feedback loop between the ZPA and the AER was interrupted, resulting in
abnormal skeletal pattern. The phenotype is apparently identical to that
of ld, which results from a mutation in the Fmn1 gene (136535). The
relationship between Grem1 and Fmn1 is interesting because of their
proximity in the mouse genome. The Fmn1 transcript comprises a large
number of exons with the most 3-prime exon located approximately 40 kb
from the gremlin open reading frame. Given the apparently identical
phenotype of ld mice to gremlin mutant mice and the proximity of Fmn1 to
Grem1, Khokha et al. (2003) tested whether gremlin would complement ld.
They found that gremlin fails to complement ld and thus identified
another ld allele. Although a complex interaction between Fmn1 and
gremlin is possible, Khokha et al. (2003) favored the idea that the ld
mutations affect gremlin expression directly and that they lie in
cis-regulatory elements for gremlin expression.

Limb bud outgrowth is driven by signals in a positive feedback loop
involving fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) genes, Sonic hedgehog (Shh;
600725), and Grem1. Precise termination of these signals is essential to
restrict limb bud size. That the sequence in mouse limb buds is
different from that in chick limb buds drove Verheyden and Sun (2008) to
explore alternative mechanisms. By analyzing compound mouse mutants
defective in genes comprising the positive loop, Verheyden and Sun
(2008) provided genetic evidence that Fgf signaling can repress Grem1
expression, revealing a novel Fgf/Grem1 inhibitory loop. The repression
occurs in both mouse and chick limb buds and is dependent on high Fgf
activity. These data supported a mechanism where the positive Fgf/Shh
loop drives outgrowth and an increase in Fgf signaling, which triggers
the Fgf/Grem1 inhibitory loop. The inhibitory loop then operates to
terminate outgrowth signals in the order observed in either mouse or
chick limb buds. Verheyden and Sun (2008) concluded that their study
unveils the concept of a self-promoting and self-terminating circuit
that may be used to attain proper tissue size in a broad spectrum of
developmental and regenerative settings. Verheyden and Sun (2008)
demonstrated that Fgf8 (600483) repression of Fgf4 (164980) expression
is dependent on Grem1 but not Shh.

;;BLOC1, SUBUNIT 2; BLOS2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BLOC1S2 is a component of the ubiquitously expressed BLOC1 multisubunit
protein complex. BLOC1 is required for normal biogenesis of specialized
organelles of the endosomal-lysosomal system, such as melanosomes and
platelet dense granules (Starcevic and Dell'Angelica, 2004).

CLONING

Using the BLOC1 subunit pallidin (PLDN; 604310) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Starcevic and Dell'Angelica
(2004) cloned BLOC1S2, which they called BLOS2. The deduced BLOS2
protein contains coiled-coil regions and has a calculated molecular mass
of 16 kD. Western blot analysis detected endogenous HeLa cell BLOS2 at
an apparent molecular mass of 18 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By mass spectrometry of BLOC1 proteins purified from bovine liver, mouse
liver, and HeLa cells, Starcevic and Dell'Angelica (2004) identified
BLOS2 as a subunit of BLOC1. Other BLOC1 subunits identified were
pallidin, muted (607289), dysbindin (DTNBP1; 607145), cappuccino
(605695), snapin (SNAPAP; 607007), BLOC1S1 (601444), and BLOC1S3
(609762). Coimmunoprecipitation and yeast 2-hybrid analyses confirmed
that these proteins interact within the BLOC1 complex.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the BLOC1S2
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP RH47426).

ADHESION AND DEGRANULATION ADAPTOR PROTEIN; ADAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

T-cell receptor signaling involves activation of the src
protein-tyrosine kinases LCK (153390) and FYN (137025), leading to the
phosphorylation of various substrates including SLP76 (LCP2; 601603). Da
Silva et al. (1993) identified FYB (called p120/130 by them), a 120- and
130-kD protein doublet that associates with the SH2 domain of FYN.
T-cell receptor ligation led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of
FYB. Da Silva et al. (1997) showed that the 120- and 130-kD doublet is
composed of 2 related isoforms of FYB. In T cells from FYN mutant mice,
the phosphorylation of FYB was reduced, but not abolished, suggesting to
da Silva et al. (1997) that FYB could be phosphorylated by another
kinase. By screening a Jurkat T-cell line expression library with
antibodies against FYB, da Silva et al. (1997) identified FYB cDNAs.
Northern blot analysis revealed that the 4.5-kb FYB mRNA is expressed
only in myeloid and T cells. Expression of FYB in mammalian cells
yielded a protein that migrated at 120 kD on SDS-PAGE. By Western
blotting, da Silva et al. (1997B) showed that FYB coimmunoprecipitated
with FYN and with SLP76 in mammalian cell lysates. They concluded that
FYB acts as a component of the FYN and SLP76 signaling cascades in T
cells.

Musci et al. (1997) cloned cDNAs encoding SLAP130, a 130-kD
phosphoprotein that is associated with SLP76. Da Silva et al. (1997)
stated that SLAP130 is identical to FYB except for 2 conservative and 1
nonconservative amino acid substitutions. Musci et al. (1997) attributed
the difference between the calculated mass of SLAP130 (86 kD) and the
observed mass by SDS-PAGE (130 kD) to posttranslational modifications or
the abundance of charged amino acids.

Da Silva et al. (1997) used the human FYB cDNA to clone the mouse
homolog. The sequence of the predicted 783-amino acid human FYB protein
shares 77% identity with that of mouse FYB.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoblot analysis, Geng et al. (2001) showed that FCER1A (147140)
aggregation induces rapid FYB tyrosine phosphorylation in rat basophilic
leukemia mast cells and the release of beta hexosaminidase (see 606873).
Confocal microscopy demonstrated that FYB colocalizes with actin (see
ACTA1; 102610) in membrane ruffles. FYB overexpression enhanced mast
cell adhesion to fibronectin (FN1; 135600) and SH3 domain-mediated
release of beta hexosaminidase, implying increased histamine release as
well. Mast cell adhesion had no effect on FYB phosphorylation but
enhanced beta hexosaminidase release.

Medeiros et al. (2007) presented evidence for a previously unrecognized
function for ADAP in regulating T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated
activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B (see 164011).
Stimulation of ADAP-deficient mouse T cells with antibodies to CD3 (see
186740) and CD28 (186760) resulted in impaired nuclear translocation of
NF-kappa-B, a reduced DNA binding, and delayed degradation and decreased
phosphorylation of I-kappa-B (see 164008). TCR-stimulated assembly of
the CARMA1 (607210)-BCL10 (603517)-MALT1 (604860) complex was
substantially impaired in the absence of ADAP. Medeiros et al. (2007)
further identified a region of ADAP that is required for association
with the CARMA1 adaptor and NF-kappa-B activation but is not required
for ADAP-dependent regulation of adhesion.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using gene targeting strategies, Griffiths et al. (2001) and Peterson et
al. (2001) each generated mice lacking Fyb expression in mature T
lymphocytes. Although lymphocyte development was normal in these mice,
splenic CD4 (186940)-positive and CD8 (see 186910)-positive T-cell
numbers were reduced, suggesting that Fyb may be required for peripheral
T-cell homeostasis. T-cell proliferation in response to phorbol ester
was normal in Fyb-deficient cells, but responses to anti-CD3E (186830),
with or without anti-CD28 (186760), were reduced, as were cytokine
production and activation marker upregulation. These results
demonstrated that Fyb acts as a positive regulator of T-cell activation.
Fyb-deficient mice also had reduced antibody production to T-dependent
antigens in vivo. Although downstream signaling pathways and antigen
receptor clustering were normal, clustering of the integrin LFA1 (see
153370 and 600065) was not. Flow chamber analysis demonstrated that
anti-CD3E-stimulated but not phorbol ester-stimulated Fyb-deficient T
cells were defective in adhering to mouse Icam1 (147840), to human ICAM2
(146630), and to other substrates mediated by integrins, although
integrin expression was not reduced. Using confocal microscopy, Peterson
et al. (2001) showed that Fyb-deficient T cells had normal clustering of
actin but no polarization of LFA1, whereas LFA1 clustering was markedly
increased in wildtype T cells. Griffiths et al. (2001) concluded that
the T-cell receptor-induced adhesion defect in integrin activation was
due to a block in 'inside-out' signaling between the T-cell receptor and
integrins. Peterson et al. (2001) and Griffiths et al. (2001) proposed
that on the basis of these findings and studies by Geng et al. (2001),
which implicated FYB in vasoactive mediator release, that FYB be
redesignated 'adhesion and degranulation adaptor protein,' or ADAP.

;;HEMATOPOIETIC PROGENITOR KINASE/GERMINAL CENTER KINASE-LIKE KINASE;
HGK;;
NCK-INTERACTING KINASE; NIK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Activation of the JNK (see 601158) pathway by a variety of environmental
and extracellular stimuli is mediated by multiple STE20-like protein
kinases (e.g., STK25, 602255). By screening a human macrophage cDNA
library with degenerate PCR primers to sequences of STE20 family
members, Yao et al. (1999) obtained a novel cDNA that they termed HGK
(for HPK1/GCK-like kinase). The HGK cDNA encodes a 1,165-amino acid
protein. Its N terminus has a catalytic kinase domain with 11 kinase
subdomains. It shares 47% and 48% amino acid sequence identity to the
catalytic domain of HPK1 (601983) and GCK (603166), respectively. The
authors identified 2 HGK isoforms, one of which has no proline-rich
domains, and another, longer variant that contains such domains and
appears to be expressed in brain only. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of 3 HGK transcripts of approximately 4.6, 6.5, and 8.5 kb in
heart, brain, skeletal muscle, pancreas, placenta, liver, lung, and
kidney. By Western blot analysis with a polyclonal antibody, Yao et al.
(1999) found that the 130-kD protein is expressed in multiple cell
lines. Expression of HGK in transfected cell lines resulted in strong
JNK activation and, in turn, c-jun transcriptional activity. HGK-induced
JNK activation was inhibited by dominant-negative MKK4 (MAP2K4; 601335),
MKK7 (MAP2K7; 603014), and TAK1 (MAP3K7; 602614) mutants. TNFA (191160)
also stimulated HGK kinase activity.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an RNA interference-based screen, Tang et al. (2006) found 4
negative regulators of insulin-responsive glucose transport in mouse
adipocytes: Pctk1 (311550), Pftk1 (610679), Ikbka (CHUK; 600664), and
Map4k4. Map4k4 suppressed expression of adipogenic transcription
factors, Cebpa (116897), Cebpb (189965), and Pparg (601487), and it
suppressed surface expression of Glut4 (SLC2A4; 138190), resulting in
attenuated membrane hexose transport activity. Depletion of Map4k4 by
RNA interference early in differentiation enhanced adipogenesis and
triglyceride deposition; in fully differentiated adipocytes, loss of
Map4k4 upregulated Glut4 expression. Conversely, conditions that
inhibited adipogenesis, such as Tnfa treatment or Pparg depletion,
markedly upregulated Map4k4. Tang et al. (2006) concluded that
MAP4K4-dependent signaling inhibited PPARG-responsive gene expression,
adipogenesis, and insulin-stimulated glucose transport.

Aouadi et al. (2009) reported the engineering of
beta-1,3-D-glucan-encapsulated siRNA particles (GeRPs) as efficient oral
delivery vehicles that potently silenced genes in mouse macrophages in
vitro and in vivo. Oral gavage of mice with GeRPs containing as little
as 20 micrograms per kilogram siRNA directed against TNF-alpha (191160)
depleted its mRNA in macrophages recovered from peritoneum, spleen,
liver, and lung, and lowered serum TNF-alpha levels. Screening with
GeRPs for inflammation genes revealed that Map4k4 is a mediator of
cytokine expression. Importantly, silencing Map4k4 in macrophages in
vivo protected mice from lipopolysaccharide-induced lethality by
inhibiting TNF-alpha and interleukin-1-beta (147720) production. Aouadi
et al. (2009) concluded that their technology defined a strategy for
oral delivery of siRNA to attenuate inflammatory responses in human
disease.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the
MAP4K4 gene, which they termed KIAA0687, to chromosome 2.

607767	TITLE *607767 SESTRIN 2; SESN2
;;SEST2;;
HYPOXIA-INDUCED GENE 95; HI95
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a microarray-based analysis, Budanov et al. (2002) identified
SEST2, which they designated HI95, as a gene upregulated in a glioma
cell line maintained under hypoxic conditions for 16 hours. The
full-length SEST2 cDNA encodes a deduced 480-amino acid protein
predicted to be a compact globular domain protein composed predominantly
of alpha-helical structures. SEST2 has several potential
serine-threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites, most of them
located within the alpha helices. Northern blot analysis revealed a
3.9-kb transcript expressed at low to moderate levels in most tissues
examined. In vitro translation of the cDNA resulted in a protein with an
apparent molecular mass of about 60 kD.

Peeters et al. (2003) analyzed the structure of p53 (191170)-activated
gene-26 (PA26, or sestrin-1; 606103) and identified a novel PA26-related
gene family, which they termed the sestrin family, comprising 3 closely
related genes in human and in mouse, PA26, SEST2, and SEST3 (607768).

GENE FUNCTION

In addition to observing upregulation of SEST2 following hypoxia in
cultured glioma cells, Budanov et al. (2002) found SEST2 expression
increased following DNA damage or oxidative stress, but not following
hyperthermia or serum starvation. Induction of SEST2 by prolonged
hypoxia or by oxidative stress appeared to be independent of p53
activation, but its induction following DNA damage (by gamma or
ultraviolet irradiation, or by doxorubicin) occurred in a p53-dependent
manner. Overexpression of SEST2 was toxic to many cultured cell types
and led to apoptotic cell death or to sensitization to experimental
insults. However, overexpression of SEST2 in a breast cancer cell line
resulted in protection from apoptotic cell death. Budanov et al. (2002)
concluded that SEST2 is involved in complex regulation of cell viability
in response to different stress conditions.

Acting as a signal, hydrogen peroxide circumvents antioxidant defense by
overoxidizing peroxiredoxins (Prxs), the enzymes that metabolize
peroxides. Budanov et al. (2004) showed that sestrins, a family of
proteins whose expression is modulated by p53, are required for
regeneration of Prxs containing cys-SO(2)H, thus reestablishing the
antioxidant firewall. Sestrins contain a predicted redox-active domain
homologous to AhpD, the enzyme catalyzing the reduction of a bacterial
peroxiredoxin, AhpC. Purified Hi95 (sestrin-2) protein supported
adenosine triphosphate-dependent reduction of overoxidized PrxI in
vitro, indicating that unlike AhpD, which is a disulfide reductase,
sestrins are cysteine sulfinyl reductases.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Peeters et al. (2003) mapped the human sestrin genes PA26,
SEST2, and SEST3 (607768) to chromosomes 6q21, 1p35.3, and 11q21,
respectively. They mapped the mouse Pa26, Sest2, and Sest3 genes to
syntenic regions on chromosomes 4, 9, and 10, respectively.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SEC15L1 is a subunit of the exocyst, a multisubunit complex first
discovered for its requirement in the yeast secretory pathway (Wang et
al., 2004).

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2004) noted that exocyst subunits have been found to
associate with a subset of Golgi-derived vesicles and plasma membrane
fractions in epithelial cell lines from several mammalian species. They
found that several endogenous exocyst subunits, including Sec15,
colocalized with microtubules and mitotic spindles in normal rat kidney
cells. Wang et al. (2004) determined that mammalian exocyst complexes
reconstituted from 8 recombinant subunits, including Sec15, inhibited
tubulin polymerization in vitro. Deletion of Sec15 diminished the
ability of the exocyst to inhibit tubulin polymerization.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SEC15L1
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP A006W20).

ANIMAL MODEL

The mouse spontaneous mutation 'hemoglobin deficit' (hbd) impairs
erythroid iron assimilation but does not cause other defects. Normal
delivery of iron to developing erythroid precursors is highly dependent
on the transferrin cycle. Through genetic mapping and complementation
experiments, Lim et al. (2005) showed that the hbd mutation is an
in-frame deletion of a conserved exon of the mouse gene Sec15l1,
encoding 1 of 2 Sec15 proteins implicated in the mammalian exocyst
complex. Sec15l1 is linked to the transferrin cycle through its
interaction with Rab11 (see 605570), a GTPase involved in vesicular
trafficking. Lim et al. (2005) proposed that inactivation of Sec15l1
alters recycling of transferrin cycle endosomes and increases the
release of transferrin receptor exocytic vesicles. This in turn
decreases erythroid iron uptake. Determining the molecular basis of the
hbd phenotype provided new insight into the intricate mechanisms
necessary for normal erythroid iron uptake and the function of a
mammalian exocyst protein.

In lethal systemic anthrax, proliferating bacilli secrete large
quantities of the toxins lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF),
leading to widespread vascular leakage and shock. Host targets of LF
(mitogen-activated protein-kinase kinases) and EF (cAMP-dependent
processes) have been implicated in the initial phase of anthrax. In an
investigation of toxin action during the final stage of infection,
Guichard et al. (2010) used Drosophila melanogaster to identify the
Rab11 (605570)/Sec15 exocyst, which acts at the last step of endocytic
recycling, as a novel target of both EF and LF. EF reduces levels of
apically localized Rab11 and indirectly blocks vesicle formation by its
binding partner and effector Sec15 (Sec15-GFP), whereas LF acts more
directly to reduce Sec15-GFP vesicles. Convergent effects of EF and LF
on Rab11/Sec15 inhibited expression of and signaling by the Notch ligand
Delta and reduced DE-cadherin levels at adherens junctions. In human
endothelial cells, the 2 toxins acted in a conserved fashion to block
formation of Sec15 vesicles, inhibit Notch signaling through Delta
(DLL4; 605185), and reduce cadherin (CDH1; 192090) expression at
adherens junctions. Guichard et al. (2010) suggested that this
coordinated disruption of the Rab11/Sec15 exocyst by anthrax toxins may
contribute to toxin-dependent barrier disruption and vascular
dysfunction during Bacillus anthracis infection.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Huntington disease (143100) is caused by expansion of a CAG
trinucleotide repeat encoding an N-terminal polyglutamine region in
huntingtin (HTT; 613004) to more than 34 units. Using N-terminal domains
of HTT containing 58 or 62 glutamines in a yeast 2-hybrid assay of a
fetal brain cDNA library, followed by database analysis and screening
brain and testis cDNA libraries, Faber et al. (1998) obtained a partial
SETD2 clone, which they called HYPB. The deduced protein has a WW
domain. Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of about 9.0 kb
that was variably expressed in all tissues examined.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned SETD2, which they designated
KIAA1732. The deduced protein contains 1,325 amino acids. RT-PCR
detected low SETD2 expression in all adult and fetal tissues and
specific adult brain regions examined.

Using a yeast 1-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library to identify
proteins that could bind transcriptional start site-2 (TS2) of the
adenovirus E1A gene, followed by RT-PCR of normal human foreskin
fibroblasts, Rega et al. (2001) cloned full-length SETD2, which they
called HBP231. The deduced 2,061-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of about 231 kD. It has a putative N-terminal tyrosine
phosphorylation site, a central SET domain, and a C-terminal WW/WWP
domain that is followed by a putative nuclear localization signal. The
C-terminal region of HBP231 corresponds to the HYPB sequence. Northern
blot analysis detected a 7.5-kb transcript expressed at variable levels
in all tissues examined. Western blot analysis of HeLa cells showed that
HBP231 had an apparent molecular mass of 231 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Faber et al. (1998) showed that HYPB
interacted with normal and mutant huntingtin in extracts of Huntington
disease lymphoblastoid cells. The interaction was mediated by the WW
domain region of HYPB and by the N-terminal proline-rich region in
huntingtin, and it was enhanced by lengthening the adjacent glutamine
tract.

Using electrophoretic mobility shift analysis with nuclear extracts of
HeLa cells, Rega et al. (2001) confirmed that endogenous HBP231 bound
the TS2 motif of the adenovirus E1A promoter in a sequence-specific
manner. HBP231 expression was elevated in human embryonic kidney cells
expressing E1A, suggesting that the observed autoactivation of E1A may
be achieved by induced HBP231 expression.

Sun et al. (2005) showed that the SET domain and flanking AWS and
postSET domains of human HBP231 mediated histone H3 (see 602810)
lys36-specific histone methyltransferase activity. The isolated
low-charged region of HBP231 immediately following the WW domain showed
transcriptional activity, although a longer construct did not. A
C-terminal fragment of HBP231 containing the AWS, SET, and postSET
domains, the low-charged region, and the WW domain associated with
hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II (see 180660), but not with the
unphosphorylated form. Domain analysis revealed that the region
C-terminal to the WW domain mediated the interaction of HBP231 with
phosphorylated RNA polymerase II. Sun et al. (2005) concluded that
HBP231 may coordinate histone methylation and transcriptional
regulation.

The yeast histone deacetylase Rpd3 is recruited to promoters and
represses transcription initiation. Carrozza et al. (2005) and Keogh et
al. (2005) independently showed that the yeast SETD2 ortholog, Set2, is
a histone H3 lys36 (K36) methyltransferase associated with a small Rpd3
complex that signals deacetylation of ORFs by Rpd3 and suppresses
transcription initiation.

MAPPING

By FISH and genomic sequence analysis, Rega et al. (2001) mapped the
SETD2 gene to chromosome 3p21.3-p21.2.

194558	TITLE *194558 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 83; ZNF83
DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

Marine et al. (1994) assigned the ZNF83 gene (also known as HPF1) to
chromosome 19 by screening a human/rodent hybrid panel and localized the
gene further to 19q13.3-q13.4 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and
digital imaging microscopy.

HISTORY

Conserved structural motifs define large families of nucleic acid
binding proteins in eukaryotes. The C2H2-type zinc finger motif,
conferring both specific RNA and DNA binding activities, was first
detected within the amino acid sequence of the Xenopus transcription
factor IIIA (Miller et al., 1985). Thereafter, vertebrate genomes were
shown to encode hundreds of so-called zinc finger proteins (ZFPs).
Subfamilies were defined on the basis of conserved sequence elements
outside the finger repeat, such as the KRAB domain. Several members of
these subfamilies were found to have a clustered genomic organization.

613621	TITLE *613621 NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE PROTEIN; NUBPL
;;IRON-SULFUR PROTEIN REQUIRED FOR NADH DEHYDROGENASE; IND1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Respiratory complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase; EC 1.6.5.3) is a
large mitochondrial inner membrane enzyme consisting of 45 subunits and
8 iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters. NUBPL, or IND1, is an Fe/S protein that
plays a critical role in the assembly of respiratory complex I, likely
by transferring Fe/S into the Fe/S-containing complex I subunits
(Sheftel et al., 2009).

CLONING

By searching a human genome database for sequences similar to Ind1 of
lower organisms, Sheftel et al. (2009) identified NUBPL, which they
called IND1. They obtained a full-length clone by PCR. The deduced
protein contains an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, a
highly conserved nucleotide-binding domain, and a putative Fe/S-binding
signature (CxxC). Western blot analysis of various human tissues
revealed highest IND1 expression in liver and kidney, with lower
expression in small intestine and brain. Fluorescence-tagged IND1
localized to the mitochondria of transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Sheftel et al. (2009) showed that recombinant human IND1 could assemble
[4Fe-4S] clusters in vitro under anaerobic conditions. Immunoelectron
microscopy revealed that knockdown of IND1 in HeLa cells via short
hairpin RNA resulted in ultrastructural changes in mitochondria,
including loss of crista membranes, massive remodeling of the
respiratory supercomplexes, and increased lactate production, likely due
to defective respiratory chain activity. IND1 depletion resulted in
massive losses in several subunits of the peripheral arm of complex I,
with the concomitant appearance of a 450-kD subcomplex representing part
of the membrane arm. Mutation of the conserved cysteine residues at
position 244 and 247 resulted in an IND1 protein unable to function in
complex I assembly. Sheftel et al. (2009) concluded that IND1
participates in respiratory chain complex I assembly by providing Fe/S
clusters to complex I subunits.

GENE STRUCTURE

Calvo et al. (2010) detected 11 exons in the NUBPL gene.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the NUBPL gene to chromosome 14q12 based on an
alignment of the NUBPL sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK022722) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with mitochondrial complex I deficiency (252010), Calvo et
al. (2010) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
NUBPL gene (613621.0001 and 613621.0002).

In 6 patients from 5 unrelated families with complex I deficiency and a
characteristic leukoencephalopathic pattern on brain MRI, Kevelam et al.
(2013) identified biallelic mutations in the NUBPL gene (613621.0001;
613621.0003-613621.0006). All patients carried at least 1 copy of a
complex allele (G56R/c.815-27T-C; 613621.0001). The first mutations were
identified by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
All patients had a characteristic leukoencephalopathic pattern on brain
MRI. Initial studies showed confluent or multifocal cerebral white
matter lesions, predominantly affecting the deep white matter while
sparing the U-fibers and internal and external capsules. There were also
signal abnormalities and swelling of the corpus callosum. Signal
abnormalities were present in the cerebellar cortex, but not in the deep
white matter. Later imaging of most patients showed improvement of the
cerebral white matter and corpus callosum abnormalities, but worsening
of the cerebellar abnormalities and additional brainstem abnormalities.
All patients developed motor problems due to ataxia in the first years
of life, but other features were somewhat variable: some patients showed
continuous regression and others showed episodic regression. Five
patients had spasticity and only 2 achieved unsupported walking.
Cognitive capabilities varied between normal and significantly
deficient. Complex I deficiency ranged between 27 and 83% of normal, and
there was no correlation between residual complex I activity and
clinical severity.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NUBPL, GLY56ARG AND 815-27T-C

In a patient with mitochondrial complex I deficiency (252010), Calvo et
al. (2010) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 alleles of the NUBPL
gene. One allele, inherited from the patient's father, carried a
c.166G-A transition in exon 2, resulting in a gly56-to-arg (G56R)
substitution, and a c.815-27T-C transition that was predicted to ablate
a consensus branch sequence and resulted in the skipping of exon 10. The
exon-skipping mutation was found in 2 of 232 control chromosomes from
persons of European ancestry. The second allele, inherited from the
patient's mother, carried a complex rearrangement interrupting NUBPL,
including a 240-kb deletion spanning exons 1 through 4 and a 130-kb
duplication involving exon 7 (613621.0002). The patient reported by
Calvo et al. (2010) presented at 2 years of age with developmental
delay, particularly of motor skills. He never achieved independent
walking. He developed myopathy, nystagmus, ataxia, upper motor neuron
signs, and absence seizures. Brain MRI showed leukodystrophy with
involvement of the cerebellar cortex and deep white matter. At age 8, he
had spasticity, ataxia, and speech problems. Patient fibroblasts had
only 19% residual complex I activity on spectrophometric enzyme assay
and 40% residual activity using dipstick assay. Transduction of patient
fibroblasts with wildtype NUBPL restored complex I activity.

By RT-PCR analysis, Tucker et al. (2012) demonstrated that the
c.815-27T-C mutation caused aberrant splicing and the generation of 3
NUBPL transcripts, 2 of which resulted in a frameshift: gly272valfsX11
and asp273glnfsX31; the former transcript was subject to
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The third band represented some wildtype
transcript. Cells from the patient reported by Calvo et al. (2010) had
only 15% wildtype transcript and no detectable protein, whereas cells
from a control who carried a heterozygous c.815-27T-C mutation had 59%
protein expression. These findings indicated that the splice site
mutation results in reduced NUBPL mRNA and protein expression. In
addition, in vitro studies showed that the G56R protein had normal
mitochondrial import and processing, was stable, and restored complex I
activity in NUBPL-deficient cells. Tucker et al. (2012) concluded that
the splice site mutation, although present in controls, is likely
pathogenic, and that the G56R variant is unlikely to be pathogenic.
However, it remained possible that the 2 variants act together to impair
protein function when inherited on the same allele. The authors
emphasized the importance of functional studies to assess the
pathogenicity of identified variants.

Kevelam et al. (2013) identified the c.815-27T-C/R56G allele in 6
patients from 5 unrelated families with complex I deficiency and a
characteristic leukoencephalopathic pattern on brain MRI. One patient
from Argentina carried the complex allele in homozygous state, whereas
the other patients were compound heterozygous for this allele and
another presumably pathogenic variant in the NUBPL gene on the other
allele (613621.0003-613621.0006). The splice site variant was found in 1
of 60 controls.

Tucker et al. (2012) determined that the deletion/duplication identified
by Calvo et al. (2010) was a complex unbalanced inversion between
regions of repetitive elements that most likely occurred during
replication.

NUBPL, 10-BP INS, NT667

In a German patient with mitochondrial complex I deficiency (252010) and
a characteristic leukoencephalopathic pattern on brain MRI, Kevelam et
al. (2013) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
NUBPL gene: a 10-bp insertion (c.667_668insCCTTGTGCTG) in exon 8,
resulting in premature termination (Glu223AlafsTer4), and 613621.0001.
The insertion mutation was not found in several large control databases.

.0004
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NUBPL, ASP105TYR

In 2 Canadian sibs with mitochondrial complex I deficiency (252010) and
a characteristic leukoencephalopathic pattern on brain MRI, Kevelam et
al. (2013) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
NUBPL gene: a 313G-T transversion in exon 4, resulting in an
asp105-to-tyr (D105Y) substitution at a conserved residue, and
613621.0001. The D105Y mutation was not found in several large control
databases. Patient fibroblasts showed decreased NUBPL and decreased
amounts of assembled complex I associated with a 50 to 60% reduction in
complex I activity compared to controls.

.0005
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NUBPL, IVS8DS, G-A, +1

In a patient from the United States with mitochondrial complex I
deficiency (252010) and a characteristic leukoencephalopathic pattern on
brain MRI, Kevelam et al. (2013) identified compound heterozygosity for
2 mutations in the NUBPL gene: a G-to-A transition in intron 8
(c.693+1G-A), predicted to result in the skipping of exon 8, and
613621.0001. The splice site mutation was not found in several large
control databases.

NUBPL, LEU193PHE

In a patient from the Netherlands with mitochondrial complex I

2 mutations in the NUBPL gene: a c.579A-C transversion in exon 7,
resulting in a leu193-to-phe (L193F) substitution, and 613621.0001. The
L193F mutation was not found in several large control databases.

608554	TITLE *608554 NEURONAL PAS DOMAIN PROTEIN 4; NPAS4
;;HLH-PAS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR NXF; NXF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NXF is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix-PER (602260)-ARNT
(126110)-SIM (see SIM2; 600892) (bHLH-PAS) class of transcriptional
regulators, which are involved in a wide range of physiologic and
developmental events (Ooe et al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching a database for PAS domain sequences, followed by screening
a fetal brain cDNA library, Ooe et al. (2004) cloned NXF. The deduced
802-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal bHLH domain, followed by 2
PAS domains and a C-terminal activation domain. Northern blot analysis
of several adult tissues detected robust expression only in brain, with
faint expression in skeletal muscle and kidney. In developing mouse
brain, expression of Nxf was only detectable beginning at embryonic day
17 and was higher in the 4-week postnatal brain. In situ hybridization
of adult rat brain revealed punctate expression in the cerebral cortex
and striatum, with prominent expression in the neuronal cell layers of
the hippocampus. In the cerebellum, slight expression was found at the
Purkinje cell layer.

GENE FUNCTION

Ooe et al. (2004) determined that the C terminus of NXF could activate a
reporter gene following transfection in neuroblastoma, embryonic kidney,
and HeLa cells. Overexpression of a general transcriptional coactivator,
p300 (602700), enhanced the activity. By mammalian 2-hybrid assay, they
found that NXF could heterodimerize with ARNT, ARNT2 (606036), and BMAL1
(602550), but not with other bHLH-PAS factors, and NXF did not
homodimerize. DNA binding studies indicated that the NXF/ARNT2
heterodimers could bind to a DNA element recognized by the SIM2/ARNT
heterodimer and also to a related sequence; however, neither factor
could bind DNA independently. In addition, SIM2 competed with NXF for
DNA binding.

Lin et al. (2008) reported that the transcription factor NPAS4 plays a
role in the development of inhibitory synapses by regulating the
expression of activity-dependent genes, which in turn control the number
of GABA-releasing synapses that form on excitatory neurons. Lin et al.
(2008) concluded that their findings demonstrated that the
activity-dependent gene program regulates inhibitory synapse development
and suggested a new role for this program in controlling the homeostatic
balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition.

Ramamoorthi et al. (2011) found that the activity-dependent
transcription factor Npas4 regulates a transcriptional program in the
CA3 region of the hippocampus that is required for contextual memory
formation. Npas4 was specifically expressed in CA3 after contextual
learning. Global knockout or selective deletion of Npas4 in CA3 both
resulted in impaired contextual memory, and restoration of Npas4 in CA3
was sufficient to reverse the deficit in global knockout mice. By
recruiting RNA polymerase II (see 180660) to promoters and enhancers of
target genes, Npas4 regulates a learning-specific transcriptional
program in CA3 that includes many well-known activity-regulated genes,
which suggested that Npas4 is a master regulator of activity-regulated
gene programs and is central to memory formation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ooe et al. (2004) determined that the mouse Nxf gene contains 8 exons
and spans 5 kb. They stated that this gene composition appears to be
conserved in the human gene.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ooe et al. (2004) mapped the NPAS4 gene to
chromosome 11q13.

612268	TITLE *612268 TUBULIN TYROSINE LIGASE-LIKE FAMILY, MEMBER 5; TTLL5
;;SRC1- AND TIF2-ASSOCIATED BINDING PROTEIN; STAMP;;
KIAA0998
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TTLL5 is a glucocorticoid receptor (GCCR; 138040) coregulator that
interacts with coactivators TIF2 (NCOA2; 601993) and SRC1 (NCOA1;
602691) (He and Simons, 2007).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned TTLL5, which they designated
KIAA0998. The deduced 1,226-amino acid protein shares 84% amino acid
identity with its rat homolog. RT-PCR ELISA detected low expression in
spleen, testis, and ovary.

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a human fetal brain library using TIF2 as
bait, followed by RT-PCR of human testis mRNA, He and Simons (2007)
cloned TTLL5, which they called STAMP. The deduced 1,277-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 143 kD and the C-terminal 705
amino acids share 83.3% identity to the putative mouse ortholog. TTLL5
contains an N-terminal TTL domain, a C-terminal coactivator interaction
domain, and 3 C-terminal receptor interaction domains. Northern blot
analysis of human tissues detected a 4.6-kb transcript with high
expression in heart and skeletal muscle and low expression in placenta,
lung, small intestine, kidney, brain, liver, spleen, thymus, and
peripheral blood leukocytes. TTLL5 localized to the cytoplasm and
nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, He and Simons (2007) demonstrated that TTLL5
interacted with TIF2 and the C-terminal 303-amino acid fragment of SRC1.
Coimmunoprecipitation assay in transfected COS-7 cells showed that TTLL5
interacted with both TIF2 and GCCR and the latter interaction was not
altered by dexamethasone induction and was mediated by the C-terminal
TTLL5 coactivator domain. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays
showed that TTLL5 and GCCR were specifically recruited to the promoters
of both GCCR-induced and -repressed genes. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)
knockdown of TTLL5 reduced the relative induction of GCCR-induced genes
LAD1 (602314), IGFBP1 (146730), IRF8 (601565), and GILZ (TSC22D3;
300506) in human osteosarcoma cells. TTLL5 interacted with agonist-bound
progesterone receptor (PGR; 607311) and androgen receptor (AR; 313700)
but did not interact with other steroid/nuclear receptor family members
tested. He and Simons (2007) suggested that TTLL5 acts with TIF2 to play
a role in glucocorticoid-mediated induction and repression.

GENE STRUCTURE

He and Simons (2007) determined that the TTLL5 gene contains 32 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, He and Simons (2007) mapped the TTLL5 gene
to chromosome 14q24.3.

602423	TITLE *602423 NUCLEAR RECEPTOR SUBFAMILY 1, GROUP H, MEMBER 3; NR1H3
;;LIVER X RECEPTOR, ALPHA;;
LX RECEPTOR, ALPHA; LXRA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The liver X receptors, LXRA and LXRB (NR1H2; 600380), form a subfamily
of the nuclear receptor superfamily and are key regulators of macrophage
function, controlling transcriptional programs involved in lipid
homeostasis and inflammation. The inducible LXRA is highly expressed in
liver, adrenal gland, intestine, adipose tissue, macrophages, lung, and
kidney, whereas LXRB is ubiquitously expressed. Ligand-activated LXRs
form obligate heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs; see 180245)
and regulate expression of target genes containing LXR response elements
(summary by Korf et al., 2009).

CLONING

Retinoic acid mediates tissue-specific expression of target genes
through its binding to nuclear hormone receptors (e.g., RARA; 180240).
To activate transcription, these receptors bind specific sites, called
hormone response elements, within the target gene's regulatory region.
By screening a human liver cDNA library with an RARA cDNA probe, Willy
et al. (1995) identified a cDNA encoding NR1H3, or LXRA, an orphan
member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. The predicted 447-amino acid
LXRA protein contains a DNA-binding domain and a putative ligand-binding
domain; the amino acid sequences of these domains are 77% identical to
those of NR1H2. Northern blot analysis showed strong expression of a
1.9-kb LXRA transcript in metabolic organs such as liver, kidney, and
intestine. In mouse, Northern blot analysis detected a low level of Lxra
expression at embryonic day 13.5 that continued to increase through
parturition.

GENE FUNCTION

Willy et al. (1995) identified a distinct retinoid response element for
LXRA/RXRA (180245) heterodimers, termed the LXR-responsive element
(LXRE), that consists of 2 degenerate copies of the consensus hexad
sequence spaced by 4 nucleotides. LXRA specifically interacted with RXRA
in vivo to form a functional heterodimer in which RXRA was the
ligand-binding subunit. Willy et al. (1995) found that LXRA-mediated
gene activation was only induced by certain retinoids, including 9-cis
retinoic acid (9cRA). They concluded that LXRA is a tissue-specific
cofactor that permits RXRA to function as a potent 9cRA receptor with a
distinct target gene specificity. Willy et al. (1995) stated that LXRA
defines a novel retinoid response system.

In an elegant series of experiments designed to understand the effect of
RXR activation on cholesterol balance, Repa et al. (2000) treated
animals with the rexinoid LG268. Animals treated with rexinoid exhibited
marked changes in cholesterol balance, including inhibition of
cholesterol absorption and repressed bile acid synthesis. Studies with
receptor-selective agonists revealed that oxysterol receptors (LXRs) and
the bile acid receptor, FXR (603826), are the RXR heterodimeric partners
that mediate these effects by regulating expression of the
reverse-cholesterol transporter, ABC1 (ABCA1; 600046), and the
rate-limiting enzyme of bile acid synthesis, CYP7A1, respectively. These
RXR heterodimers serve as key regulators in cholesterol homeostasis by
governing reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral tissues, bile
acid synthesis in liver, and cholesterol absorption in intestine.
Activation of RXR/LXR heterodimers inhibits cholesterol absorption by
upregulation of ABC1 expression in the small intestine. Activation of
RXR/FXR heterodimers represses CYP7A1 expression and bile acid
production, leading to a failure to solubilize and absorb cholesterol.
Studies have shown that RXR/FXR-mediated repression of CYP7A1 is
dominant over RXR/LXR-mediated induction of CYP7A1, which explains why
the rexinoid represses rather than activates CYP7A1 (Lu et al., 2000).
Activation of the LXR signaling pathway results in the upregulation of
ABC1 in peripheral cells, including macrophages, to efflux free
cholesterol for transport back to the liver through high density
lipoprotein, where it is converted to bile acids by the LXR-mediated
increase in CYP7A1 expression. Secretion of biliary cholesterol in the
presence of increased bile acid pools normally results in enhanced
reabsorption of cholesterol; however, with the increased expression of
ABC1 and efflux of cholesterol back into the lumen, there is a reduction
in cholesterol absorption and net excretion of cholesterol and bile
acid. Rexinoids therefore offer a novel class of agents for treating
elevated cholesterol.

LXR activity is critical for physiologic lipid metabolism and transport.
Tangirala et al. (2002) linked LXR signaling pathways to the
pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Bone marrow transplantations
were used to selectively eliminate macrophage LXR expression in the
context of murine models of atherosclerosis. The results demonstrated
that LXRs are endogenous inhibitors of atherogenesis. Additionally,
elimination of LXR activity in bone marrow-derived cells mimicked many
aspects of Tangier disease (205400), a human high density lipoprotein
deficiency, including aberrant regulation of cholesterol transporter
expression, lipid accumulation in macrophages, splenomegaly, and
increased atherosclerosis. These results identified LXRs as targets for
therapeutic intervention in cardiovascular disease.

Macrophages have important roles in both lipid metabolism and
inflammation and are central to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The
liver X receptors (LXRs) are established mediators of lipid-inducible
gene expression. In studies in cultured cells and in mice, Joseph et al.
(2003) demonstrated that LXRs and their ligands are negative regulators
of macrophage inflammatory gene expression. Transcriptional profiling of
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophages revealed reciprocal
LXR-dependent regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and the
innate immune response. In vitro, LXR ligands inhibited the expression
of inflammatory mediators such as inducible nitric oxide synthase
(163730), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 (600262), and interleukin-6 (IL6;
147620) in response to bacterial infection or LPS stimulation. In vivo,
LXR agonists reduced inflammation in a model of contact dermatitis and
inhibited inflammatory gene expression in the aortas of atherosclerotic
mice. These findings indicated that LXRs are lipid-dependent regulators
of inflammatory gene expression that may serve to link lipid metabolism
and immune functions in macrophages.

Mitro et al. (2007) showed that glucose binds and stimulates the
transcriptional activity of LXR, a nuclear receptor that coordinates
hepatic lipid metabolism. D-glucose and D-glucose-6-phosphate are direct
agonists of both LXR-alpha and LXR-beta. Glucose activated LXR at
physiologic concentrations expected in the liver and induced expression
of LXR target genes with efficacy similar to that of oxysterols, the
known LXR ligands. Cholesterol homeostasis genes that require LXR for
expression were upregulated in liver and intestine of fasted mice refed
with a glucose diet, indicating that glucose is an endogenous LXR
ligand. Mitro et al. (2007) concluded that their results identified LXR
as a transcriptional switch that integrates hepatic glucose metabolism
and fatty acid synthesis.

Zelcer et al. (2009) demonstrated that the sterol-responsive nuclear
liver X receptor (LXR) helps maintain cholesterol homeostasis, not only
through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also through suppression of
LDL uptake. LXR inhibits the LDL receptor (LDLR; 606945) pathway through
the transcriptional induction of IDOL (MYLIP; 610082), an E3 ubiquitin
ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic
domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduced,
whereas LXR knockout increased, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a
tissue-selective manner. IDOL knockdown in hepatocytes increased LDLR
protein levels and promoted LDL uptake. Conversely, Zelcer et al. (2009)
found that adenovirus-mediated expression of IDOL in mouse liver
promoted LDLR degradation and elevated plasma LDL levels. Zelcer et al.
(2009) concluded that the LXR-IDOL-LDLR axis defines a complementary
pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol
regulation of cholesterol uptake.

ANIMAL MODEL

Peet et al. (1998) demonstrated that mice lacking the oxysterol receptor
LXRA lost their ability to respond normally to dietary cholesterol and
were unable to tolerate any amount of cholesterol in excess of that
which they synthesized de novo. When fed diets containing cholesterol,
Lxra -/- mice failed to induce transcription of the gene encoding
cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1; 118455), the rate-limiting
enzyme in bile acid synthesis. This defect was associated with a rapid
accumulation of large amounts of cholesterol in the liver that
eventually led to impaired hepatic function. The regulation of several
other crucial lipid metabolizing genes was also altered in Lxra -/-
mice. The results of Peet et al. (1998) demonstrated the existence of a
physiologically significant feed-forward regulatory pathway for sterol
metabolism and established the role of LXRA as the major sensor of
dietary cholesterol.

Repa et al. (2002) presented evidence for the direct control of the
ATP-binding cassette sterol transporters Abca1 (600046), Abcg5 (605459),
and Abcg8 (605460) by the liver X receptors. The intensity of hepatic
and jejunal staining for Abcg5/g8 and Abca1 was increased in normal mice
fed cholesterol or other Lxr agonists. Cholesterol feeding resulted in
upregulation of Abcg5 and Abcg8 in the Lxrb-null mice, but not in the
Lxra-null or double knockout mice, suggesting that Lxra is required for
sterol upregulation of Abcg5/g8 in this model. In a rat hepatoma cell
line, Lxr-dependent transcription of the Abcg5/g8 genes was
cycloheximide-resistant, indicating that these genes are directly
regulated by the liver X receptors.

Joseph et al. (2002) demonstrated that the nonsteroidal Lxr agonist
GW3965 has potent antiatherogenic activity in 2 different murine models:
Ldlr -/- mice (606945) and ApoE -/- mice (107741).

Joseph et al. (2003) demonstrated that LXR agonists reduced inflammation
in a model of contact dermatitis and inhibited inflammatory gene
expression in the aortas of atherosclerotic mice; these and other
findings suggested that LXRs are lipid-dependent regulators of
inflammatory gene expression that may serve to link lipid metabolism and
immune functions in macrophages.

In Abcg5/Abcg8-deficient mice, Yang et al. (2004) demonstrated that
accumulation of plant sterols perturbed cholesterol homeostasis in the
adrenal gland, with a 91% reduction in its cholesterol content. Despite
very low cholesterol levels, there was no compensatory increase in
cholesterol synthesis or in lipoprotein receptor expression. Adrenal
cholesterol levels returned to near-normal levels in mice treated with
ezetimibe, which blocks phytosterol absorption. In cultured adrenal
cells, stigmasterol but not sitosterol inhibited SREBP2 (600481)
processing and reduced cholesterol synthesis; stigmasterol also
activated the liver X receptor in a cell-based reporter assay. Yang et
al. (2004) concluded that selected dietary plant sterols disrupt
cholesterol homeostasis by affecting 2 critical regulatory pathways of
lipid metabolism.

Macrophages play a direct role, through both innate and adaptive
immunity, in microbial killing, and they orchestrate inflammatory
responses through the release of immune modulators, such as chemokines
and cytokines. Joseph et al. (2004) found that mice lacking both Lxra
and Lxrb (Lxr-null) were highly susceptible to infection with Listeria
monocytogenes (LM) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, they
determined that Lxra-deficient mice were more susceptible than
Lxrb-deficient mice. Compared with wildtype mice, bacterial burdens were
2 logs higher in Lxr-null and Lxra -/- mice, and neutrophilic abscesses
in liver were increased in Lxr-null mice. Analysis of plasma cytokine
and chemokine mediators indicated no significant change in inflammatory
mediators, except for Il6 and Il12p70 (see 161560). Microarray analysis
and real-time RT-PCR revealed that the most striking difference in
response to LM infection in the mutant mice was reduced expression of
the antiapoptotic factor Sp-alpha (CD5L; 602592) and, to a lesser
extent, Marco (604870), both of which are members of the scavenger
receptor cysteine-rich repeat family. Sp-alpha expression was severely
compromised in response to LXR ligands in Lxra -/- macrophages, but not
in Lxrb -/- macrophages, and the Sp-alpha promoter was preferentially
activated by Lxra. In contrast, expression of Cd14 (158120) and Cd68
(153634) increased in Lxr-null mice after LM infection. Infection of
macrophages with LM or Shigella, but not with extracellular bacteria,
strongly induced Lxra expression, but not Lxrb expression, via the NOD
(see CARD4; 605980) signaling pathway. Flow cytometric and TUNEL
analyses demonstrated increased apoptosis in Lxr-null macrophages
compared with wildtype macrophages. Joseph et al. (2004) concluded that
LXR activity and its regulation of Sp-alpha promotes macrophage survival
and antimicrobial function in the setting of LM and intracellular
pathogen infection.

In a mouse renin (179820)-expressing cell line, Morello et al. (2005)
demonstrated that both LXRA and LXRB could bind to the renin promoter
and regulate renin transcription; cAMP increased LXRA activity but
decreased that of LXRB. In the mouse kidney, in situ hybridization
studies showed colocalization of renin and LXRA in juxtaglomerular
cells, and in mouse models, renin-angiotensin (see 106150) activation
was associated with increased binding of LXRA to the renin promoter. In
Lxra-null mice, the elevation of renin triggered by adrenergic
stimulation was abolished; untreated Lxrb-null mice exhibited reduced
kidney renin mRNA levels compared with controls. Lxra/Lxrb-null mice
showed a combined phenotype of lower basal renin and blunted adrenergic
response. Morello et al. (2005) concluded that LXRA and LXRB regulate
renin expression in vivo by directly interacting with the renin promoter
and that the cAMP/LXRA signaling pathway is required for adrenergic
control of the renin-angiotensin system.

Cummins et al. (2006) demonstrated that under chronic dietary stress the
adrenal glands of Lxra/Lxrb double-null mice accumulated free
cholesterol, whereas wildtype mice maintained cholesterol homeostasis.
At baseline, Lxra/Lxrb double-null mice exhibited a marked decrease in
Abca1 and derepression of Star (600617) expression, causing a net
decrease in cholesterol efflux and an increase in steroidogenesis. In
Lxra/Lxrb double-null mice pretreated with dexamethasone to prevent the
acute stress response, the phenotype of hypercorticosteronemia,
cholesterol ester accumulation, and adrenomegaly was specific to loss of
Lxra and not Lxrb. Western blot analysis showed increased expression of
STAR in human and mouse adrenal cells treated with LXR and RXR agonists.
Stimulation of Star expression by Lxra activation was mediated by
binding of the Lxra/Rxra heterodimer to an LXR response element (LRE) in
the mouse Star promoter. Cummins et al. (2006) suggested that LXRA
provides a safety valve to limit free cholesterol levels as a basal
protective mechanism in the adrenal gland.

Bradley et al. (2007) generated Lxra-null/Apoe-null mice and observed
extreme cholesterol accumulation in peripheral tissues, a dramatic
increase in whole-body cholesterol burden, and accelerated
atherosclerosis, which suggested that the level of Lxr pathway
activation in macrophages achieved by Lxrb and endogenous ligand was
unable to maintain homeostasis in the setting of hypercholesterolemia.
Treatment of Lxra-null/Apoe-null mice with the highly efficacious
synthetic Lxr agonist GW3965, however, ameliorated the cholesterol
overload phenotype and reduced atherosclerosis. Bradley et al. (2007)
concluded that LXRA has an essential role in maintaining peripheral
cholesterol homeostasis in the context of hypercholesterolemia.

Using mice lacking Lxra or Lxrb, Bensinger et al. (2008) showed that
T-cell activation triggered induction of the oxysterol-metabolizing
enzyme Sult2b1 (604125), suppression of the Lxr pathway for cholesterol
transport, and promotion of the Srebp2 pathway for cholesterol
synthesis. Proliferation was inhibited by Lxr ligation during T-cell
activation by mitogen, but cells from mice lacking Lxrb had a
proliferative advantage. Lymphocytes lacking Abcg1 (603076) were not
inhibited in the presence of Lxr agonists, indicating that transport of
sterols by ABCG1 is required for LXR agonist-mediated inhibition. Mice
lacking Lxrb displayed lymphoid hyperplasia and enhanced responses to
antigenic challenge. Bensinger et al. (2008) concluded that cellular
cholesterol levels in dividing T cells are maintained, in part, through
reciprocal regulation of LXR and SREBP transcriptional programs, and
that LXR signaling is a metabolic checkpoint that modulates cell
proliferation and immunity.

Using RT-PCR analysis of Cd11c (ITGAX; 151510)-positive lung and
alveolar cells from mice infected intratracheally with Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, Korf et al. (2009) detected increased expression of Lxra
and Lxrb and their target genes, Apoe and Abca1, as well as Pparg
(601487) and Srebp1 (SREBF1; 184756). Mice deficient in Lxra or both
Lxra and Lxrb, but not mice deficient in Lxrb only, were more
susceptible to infection than wildtype mice in terms of bacterial burden
and in size and number of granulomatous lesions. Double-knockout mice
failed to mount an early neutrophilic response and showed dysregulation
in the expression of inflammatory factors by Cd11c cells. Diminished Th1
and Th17 function, but not Th2 function, was also found in lungs of
infected mice. Treatment with Lxr agonists resulted in a 10-fold
decrease in bacterial burden and increased Th1 and Th17 function. Korf
et al. (2009) concluded that the neutrophil-IL17 (603149) axis depends
on LXR signaling and is important in resistance to M. tuberculosis
infection.

300118	TITLE *300118 RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 6; ARHGAP6
;;GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN, RHO, 6; RHOGAP6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In a search for the genetic defect in microphthalmia with linear skin
defects syndrome (MLS; 309801), Schaefer et al. (1997) trapped exons
from 14 overlapping cosmids from the 500-kb MLS critical region in
Xp22.3. Using exon connection followed by cDNA library screening, they
identified a 2.4-kb contig of cDNA clones spanning 170 kb of genomic
sequence in the MLS deletion region. Northern analysis of this cDNA
detected a prominent transcript of approximately 4.2 kb and a less
abundant transcript of approximately 6 kb in all tissues examined, with
additional transcripts in skeletal muscle. Sequence analysis revealed a
coding region of 601 amino acids contained in 12 exons, with a splice
variant isoform of 495 amino acids. The predicted protein sequence of
the gene, symbolized ARHGAP6, contains homology to the GTPase-activating
(GAP) domain of the Rho-GAP family of proteins (e.g., 300023), which has
been implicated in the regulation of actin polymerization at the plasma
membrane in several cellular processes. Schaefer et al. (1997) discussed
reasons for thinking that a defect in the Rho pathway may play a role in
the pathogenesis of MLS syndrome.

GENE STRUCTURE

Iwase et al. (2007) determined that AMELX (300391) resides in intron 1
of ARHGAP6 in the opposite orientation.

GENE FUNCTION

Prakash et al. (2000) investigated the function of ARHGAP6 by generating
Arhgap6-null mice and also by in vitro expression studies. Surprisingly,
loss of the rhoGAP function of Arhgap6 did not cause any detectable
phenotypic or behavioral abnormalities in the mutant mice. Transfected
mammalian cells expressing ARHGAP6 lost their actin stress fibers,
retracted from the growth surface, and extended thin, branching
processes resembling filopodia. The ARHGAP6 protein colocalized with
actin filaments through an N-terminal domain and recruited filamentous
actin into the growing processes. Mutation of a conserved arginine
residue in the rhoGAP domain prevented the loss of stress fibers but had
little effect on process outgrowth. The authors concluded that ARHGAP6
has 2 independent functions: one as a GAP with specificity for RhoA and
the other as a cytoskeletal protein that promotes actin remodeling.

To determine which Arhgap6 promoters were used during enamel formation,
Hu et al. (2012) isolated mRNA from ameloblasts and enamel organ
epithelia (EOE) of mouse first molars at the secretory (day 5) and
maturation (day 12) stages. No Arhgap6 expression from promoters 1a and
1c was detected in secretory stage ameloblasts or EOE or maturation
stage ameloblasts. Trace expression was detected from these promoters in
maturation state EOE. Arhgap6 expression from promoter 1b was low, but
detectable, in secretory stage ameloblasts and EOE and was noticeably
stronger in maturation stage ameloblasts and EOE. Hu et al. (2012)
concluded that in developing mouse molars, Arhgap6 is expressed almost
exclusively from promoter 1b in developing molars, and predominantly
during the maturation stage.

MAPPING

Schaefer et al. (1997) identified the ARHGAP6 gene within the critical
region defined for the microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome
on Xp22.3.

606584	TITLE *606584 PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, NONRECEPTOR-TYPE, 23; PTPN23
;;HIS-DOMAIN PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE; HDPTP;;
KIAA1471
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Toyooka et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding a novel protein tyrosine
phosphatase, PTPN23, from a gastric cancer cell line. The predicted
protein contains at least 1,636 amino acids and has several features
distinct from those in previously identified PTPs, the most striking of
which is the sequence VHCSSG instead of the invariant VHCSAG sequence at
the PTP active center. PTPN23 contains a zinc-hand domain, which the
authors called a 'His domain' (HD); several SH3-binding motifs; a
tyrosine phosphatase domain; a C-terminal PEST motif; and an N-terminal
domain similar to yeast BRO1, mouse rhophilin (601031), and human AIP1
(605555). It appears to be the homolog of rat PTP-TD14 which has been
found to inhibit activated H-ras-mediated cell transformation (Cao et
al., 1998). Northern blot analysis in rat revealed ubiquitous expression
of a 6-kb PTPN23 transcript. Expression experiments demonstrated that
PTPN23 is distributed within the cytoplasm.

In the RERF-LCMA small cell lung cancer cell line (see 182280), Toyooka
et al. (2000) identified a hemizygous missense mutation in the PTPN23
gene, a CCT-to-TCT change resulting in a pro1099-to-ser substitution.
The mutation causes an alteration in the structure of one of the
SH3-binding motifs within the His domain.

GENE FUNCTION

In a functional genomic screen using RNA interference, Kim et al. (2010)
identified PTPN23 as a gene involved in ciliogenesis control. Silencing
of PTPN23 greatly reduced the number of ciliated cells in functional
assays.

GENE STRUCTURE

Toyooka et al. (2000) determined that the PTPN23 gene contains at least
25 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and sequence analysis, Toyooka et al.

;;PROTEASOME COMPONENT 5; PSC5;;
PROTEASOME SUBUNIT ZETA
DESCRIPTION See 176842.

DeMartino et al. (1991) cloned the PSMA5 gene, termed 'subunit zeta' by
them. The cDNA encoded a 241-amino acid polypeptide. The calculated and
observed molecular masses were 26 kD and 29 kD, respectively. Northern
blot analysis revealed an mRNA of 1.2 kb in both human placenta and HeLa
cells.

Coux et al. (1996) reviewed the structures and functions of the 20S
proteasome subunits. The alpha subunits comprise the outer rings of the
proteasome. Some alpha subunits contain a functional nuclear
localization signal; proteasomes are found in both the nuclear and
cytoplasmic compartments of the cell. Alpha subunits may constitute a
physical barrier that limits access of cytosolic proteins into the inner
proteolytic chamber.

To determine whether the order in a cluster of genes that had been
mapped to chromosome 1q in the Chinese hamster by a coamplification
mapping technique is conserved in the human genome, Mayau et al. (1998)
screened the YAC library from the CEPH laboratory by PCR. They found
that, as in the hamster, the PSMA5 gene was close to GNAI3 (139370),
which is located at 1p13.

608510	TITLE *608510 SH2 DOMAIN-CONTAINING 1B; SH2D1B
;;EWS/FLI1-ACTIVATED TRANSCRIPT 2; EAT2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

By binding phosphotyrosines through its free SRC (190090) homology-2
(SH2) domain, EAT2 regulates signal transduction through receptors
expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (Morra et al.,
2001).

CLONING

By representational difference analysis of NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts
expressing the EWS (133450)/FLI1 (193067) fusion protein, an aberrant
transcription factor, Thompson et al. (1996) cloned mouse Eat2. The
deduced 132-amino acid Eat2 protein consists principally of an SH2
domain flanked by short N and C termini. Northern blot analysis detected
a major transcript of about 1.5 kb in mouse spleen and lung, and these
tissues also expressed larger transcripts at weaker levels. A band of
about 1.2 kb was expressed at low levels in liver, skeletal muscle, and
kidney. No expression was detected in heart, brain, and testis. RT-PCR
detected EAT2 transcripts in normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes
and thymus. Expression was also detected in Ewing sarcoma (612219) cell
lines containing either EWS/FLI1 or EWS/ERG (165080) fusion genes, as
well as in some tumor cell lines without the EWS/FLI1 fusion gene.

Morra et al. (2001) cloned human EAT2 by PCR of a splenocyte cDNA
library. The deduced protein contains 132 amino acids. RT-PCR detected
Eat2 in 2 mouse B-leukemia cell lines, purified B lymphocytes and
macrophages, and peritoneal exudate macrophages from mice lacking T and
B cells. Expression was not detected in thymus or a mouse T-leukemia
cell line. Human EAT2 was amplified in 5 of 6 B-lymphoma or
lymphoblastoid cell lines tested.

Tangye et al. (2002) cloned EAT2 from a spleen cDNA library. The EAT2
protein shares 64% and 45% identity with mouse Eat2 and human SAP
(300490), respectively, and it has a calculated molecular mass of 15.3
kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Thompson et al. (1996) created NIH 3T3 cells containing a
transformation-competent, inducible EWS/FLI1 transgene. Abundant
EWS/FLI1 transcripts were detected within 2 hours of induction, and
endogenous Eat2 expression was detected 4 hours after induction.
Expression of Eat2 also correlated with transformation of NIH 3T3 cells
by chimeric proteins related to EWS/FLI1, but not by unrelated genes. By
in vitro binding assays, Thompson et al. (1996) demonstrated that mouse
Eat2 bound phosphotyrosine in a manner dependent on the invariant
arginine in the FLVRES motif of the SH2 domain.

Using a variation of the yeast 2-hybrid assay, Morra et al. (2001)
determined that mouse Eat2 bound to the cytoplasmic tail of the
lymphocyte antigen CD150 (603492). Immunoprecipitation of cotransfected
COS-7 cells confirmed this interaction and indicated that Eat2 also
bound the related receptors CD84 (604513), CD229 (600684), and CD244
(605554). Eat2 binding blocked SHP2 (176876) recruitment to these
receptors. Eat2 did not bind CD150 and CD229 when the critical tyrosine
was mutated to phenylalanine. Overexpression of Eat2 induced tyrosine
phosphorylation of the CD150-related receptors.

Most CD2 family proteins interact with SAP via specific tyrosine-based
motifs, but B cells that express CD84 do not express SAP. Therefore,
Tangye et al. (2002) predicted that a functional SAP homolog exists in B
lymphocytes and suggested EAT2 as a candidate. Immunoprecipitation
analysis of CD84/SAP- and CD84/EAT2-transfected cells showed that
tyrosine-phosphorylated CD84 can associate with both SAP and EAT2.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Morra et al. (2001) analyzed crystals of mouse Eat2 grown with a
14-amino acid segment identical to the cytoplasmic tail of human CD150
with phosphorylated tyr281. The phosphotyrosine was coordinated in an
unusual 3-pronged fashion in which the conventional 2-pronged
interaction observed in other SH2 domain complexes was present with a
third interaction with amino acids N-terminal to tyr281.

GENE STRUCTURE

Morra et al. (2001) determined that the EAT2 gene contains 4 exons and
spans about 14.7 kb. It also has an alternative exon 3a. The 5-prime UTR
contains a canonical TATA box, and the 3-prime UTR contains 3 ARE
recognition sites.

MAPPING

By FISH, Thompson et al. (1996) mapped the EAT2 gene to chromosome 1q22.

159558	TITLE *159558 MYELOID/LYMPHOID OR MIXED LINEAGE LEUKEMIA, TRANSLOCATED TO, 3; MLLT3
;;MIXED LINEAGE LEUKEMIA, TRANSLOCATED TO, 3;;
ALL1-FUSED GENE FROM CHROMOSOME 9; AF9
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nakamura et al. (1993) cloned and sequenced cDNAs derived from
transcripts of the AF4 (159557) and AF9 genes involved in the chromosome
abnormalities t(4;11)(q21;q23) and t(9;11)(p22;q23), respectively. They
found that the AF4 and AF9 genes, each of which fuses with the ALL1 gene
(159555) in leukemia-associated translocations, show high sequence
homology with the ENL gene (159556) on chromosome 19, which is fused to
the ALL1 gene in patients with leukemia and the translocation
t(11;19)(q23;p13). They found further that the protein products of the
AF4, AF9, and ENL genes contained nuclear targeting sequences as well as
serine-rich and proline-rich regions. Stretches abundant in basic amino
acids were also present in the 3 proteins. These results indicated that
the different proteins fused to ALL1 polypeptides in leukemia provide
similar functional domains. The AF9 gene is also symbolized MLLT3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Strissel et al. (2000) noted that the AF9 gene is more than 100 kb, and
2 patient breakpoint cluster regions (BCRs) have been identified; BCR1
is within intron 4, previously called site A, whereas BCR2 or site B
spans introns 7 and 8. Strissel et al. (2000) defined the exon-intron
boundaries and identified several different structural elements in AF9,
including a colocalizing in vivo DNA topo II cleavage site and an in
vitro DNase I hypersensitive (DNase 1 HS) site in intron 7 in BCR2.
Reversibility experiments demonstrated a religation of the topo II
cleavage sites. In addition, 2 scaffold associated regions (SARs) are
located centromeric to the topo II and DNase I HS cleavage sites and
border breakpoint regions in 2 leukemic cells lines: SAR1 is located in
intron 4, whereas SAR2 encompasses parts of exons 5-7. The authors thus
demonstrated that the patient breakpoint regions of AF9 share the same
structural elements as the MLL BCR, and they proposed a DNA breakage and
repair model for nonhomologous recombination between MLL and its partner
genes, particularly AF9.

CYTOGENETICS

The human AF9 gene is one of the most common fusion partner genes with
the ALL1 gene at 11q23 (also called MLL), resulting in the
t(9;11)(p22;q23) (Nakamura et al., 1993; Strissel et al., 2000).

In a 6-year-old girl with neuromotor developmental delay, cerebellar
ataxia, and epilepsy, Pramparo et al. (2005) identified a constitutional
translocation t(4;9)(q35;p22) disrupting the MLLT3 gene. Pramparo et al.
(2005) stated that this was the first report of the MLLT3 gene involved
in a nonfusion balanced translocation, suggesting a haploinsufficiency
model associated with this patient's phenotype.

GENE FUNCTION

Krivtsov et al. (2006) showed that leukemia stem cells can maintain the
global identity of the progenitor from which they arose while activating
a limited stem-cell- or self-renewal-associated program. They isolated
leukemia stem cells from leukemias initiated in committed granulocyte
macrophage progenitors through introduction of the MLL-AF9 fusion
protein encoded by the t(9;11)(p22;q23). The leukemia stem cells were
capable of transferring leukemia to secondary recipient mice when only 4
cells were transferred, and possessed an immunophenotype and global gene
expression profile very similar to that of normal granulocyte macrophage
progenitors. However, a subset of genes highly expressed in normal
hematopoietic stem cells was reactivated in leukemic stem cells.
Leukemic stem cells can thus be generated from committed progenitors
without widespread reprogramming of gene expression, and a leukemia
self-renewal-associated signature is activated in the process. Krivtsov
et al. (2006) concluded that their findings define progression from
normal progenitor to cancer stem cell, and suggest that targeting a
self-renewal program expressed in an abnormal context may be possible.

;;RPB6, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF;;
RNA POLYMERASE II, 14.4-KD SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION The DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (EC 2.7.7.6) is responsible for the
transcription of protein-encoding genes. It is composed of 10 to 14
subunits ranging in mass from approximately 220 kD (POLR2A; 180660) to
approximately 7 kD (POLR2K; 606033). For general information on the
structure and function of RNA polymerase II, see 180660.

CLONING

By screening a HeLa cell cDNA library with probes obtained using a
partial POLR2F cDNA sequence (Adams et al., 1991), Acker et al. (1994)
isolated cDNAs representing the entire coding sequence of the RNA
polymerase II subunit POLR2F, which they called RPB14.4. The deduced
127-amino acid POLR2F protein has a calculated molecular mass of
approximately 14.4 kD. It is highly acidic, with a calculated
isoelectric point of 3.7. POLR2F contains a predicted C-terminal leucine
zipper domain, which is not preceded by a basic domain. The POLR2F
protein shares 49% sequence identity with the S. cerevisiae polymerase
subunit ABC23, with the C-terminal regions showing the highest
conservation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pusch et al. (1996) found that the POLR2F gene spans 13,083 bp and
contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

Pusch et al. (1996) identified the POLR2F cDNA sequence within a cosmid
that maps to 22q13.1. They stated that the POLR2F gene is located no
more than 600 kb from the PDGFB gene (190040).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Cramer et al. (2000) derived a backbone model of a 10-subunit yeast RNA
polymerase II using x-ray diffraction data extending to 3-angstrom
resolution. All 10 subunits exhibited a high degree of identity with the
corresponding human proteins, and 9 of the 10 subunits are conserved
among the 3 eukaryotic RNA polymerases I, II, and III. Notable features
of the model include a pair of jaws, formed by subunits Rpb1 (180660),
Rpb5 (180664), and Rpb9 (180662), that appear to grip DNA downstream of
the active center. A clamp on the DNA nearer the active center, formed
by Rpb1, Rpb2 (180661), and Rpb6 (homologous to human POLR2F), may be
locked in the closed position by RNA, accounting for the great stability
of transcribing complexes. A pore in the protein complex beneath the
active center may allow entry of substrates for polymerization and exit
of the transcript during proofreading and passage through pause sites in
the DNA.

;;PROTEASOME SUBUNIT X;;
PSX LARGE MULTIFUNCTIONAL PROTEASE X; LMPX;;
PROTEASOME SUBUNIT BETA-5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteasomes are the proteolytic complex responsible for major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted antigen presentation
(Akiyama et al., 1994).

See PSMB2 (602175) for further discussion of beta-type proteasome
subunits.

CLONING

Akiyama et al. (1994) cloned the full-length cDNA and showed that PSMB5
has high amino acid similarity to PSMB8 (177046).

GENE FUNCTION

Akiyama et al. (1994) showed that treatment with interferon-gamma (IFNG;
147570) increased expression of MHC-encoded LMP2 (PSMB9; 177045) and
LMP7 (PSMB8; 177046) subunits of the proteasome and decreased expression
of 2 proteasomal subunits PSMB5 and PSMB6, which altered the proteolytic
specificity of proteasomes. IFNG may induce subunit replacements of
PSMB5 and PSMB6, producing proteasomes that may be more appropriate for
the immunologic processing of endogenous antigens.

Bortezomib, a reversible proteasome inhibitor used in the treatment of
refractory multiple myeloma (see 254500), targets primarily the
chymotrypsin-like activity of PSMB5. To study the molecular basis of
bortezomib resistance, Oerlemans et al. (2008) generated high levels of
acquired resistance in human myelomonocytic THP1 cells by exposure to
stepwise increasing concentrations of bortezomib. Analysis of resistant
cells revealed that those with higher levels of resistance were
homozygous for a missense mutation in the highly conserved
substrate/inhibitory binding domain of PSMB5. In addition, there was
dramatic overexpression of PSM5B protein, but not of other proteasome
subunits. RNAi-mediated silencing of PSMB5 expression resulted in
restoration of bortezomib sensitivity in resistant cells. Oerlemans et
al. (2008) concluded that bortezomib resistance is associated with
selective overexpression of a mutant PSMB5 protein.

MAPPING

The PSMB5 gene was mapped to chromosome 14q11.2 by Belich et al. (1994).
McCusker et al. (1997) demonstrated that the PSMB5 gene is located on
14q11.2 within 1 Mb of the genes encoding the alpha (600654) and beta
(602161) subunits of the PA28 complex.

;;TIN2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TINF2 is a subunit of the 6-protein shelterin/telosome complex. This
complex protects telomere ends and cooperates with telomerase (see TERT;
187270) to maintain telomeres. TINF2 plays a central role in the
assembly and function of the shelterin/telosome complex by connecting
the double-stranded DNA-binding proteins TRF1 (TERF1; 600951) and TRF2
(TERF2; 602027) to the single-stranded DNA-binding unit TPP1 (ACD;
609377)/POT1 (606478) (summary by Yang et al., 2011).

CLONING

By interaction cloning using the telomeric DNA-binding protein TRF1, Kim
et al. (1999) isolated a novel human telomere-associated protein that
they named TIN2. The TIN2 protein contains 354 amino acids. A wide
variety of human tissues and cell types expressed a 2.4-kb TIN2
transcript on Northern blot analysis, and expression did not vary with
growth state, immortalization, or transformation. TIN2 colocalized with
TRF1 in nuclei and metaphase chromosomes.

Yang et al. (2011) stated that the 354-amino acid TINF2 protein contains
an N-terminal domain of about 200 amino acids that binds the
shelterin/telosome subunits TPP1 and TRF2, followed by an approximately
20-amino acid TRF1-binding motif.

GENE FUNCTION

Kim et al. (1999) showed that TIN2 interacted with TRF1 in vitro and in
cells. Expression of a TIN2 mutant lacking N-terminal sequences resulted
in elongated human telomeres in a telomerase-dependent manner. Kim et
al. (1999) interpreted the findings as suggesting that TRF1 is
insufficient for control of telomere length in human cells and that TIN2
is an essential mediator of TRF1 function. The mutant TIN2 had the
properties of a dominant-negative mutant. The findings suggested that
wildtype TIN2 is a negative regulator of telomerase length.

Telomere length in humans is partly controlled by a feedback mechanism
in which telomere elongation by telomerase is limited by the
accumulation of the TRF1 complex at chromosome ends. TRF1 itself can be
inhibited by the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity of its
interacting partner tankyrase-1 (603303), which abolishes its DNA
binding activity in vitro and removes the TRF1 complex from telomeres in
vivo. Ye and de Lange (2004) reported that the inhibition of TRF1 by
tankyrase is in turn controlled by a second TRF1-interacting factor,
TIN2. Partial knockout of TIN2 by small hairpin RNA in a
telomerase-positive cell line resulted in telomere elongation, which is
typical of reduced TRF1 function. Transient inhibition of TIN2 with
small interfering RNA led to diminished telomeric TRF1 signals. These
and other data identified TIN2 as a PARP modulator in the TRF1 complex
and explained how TIN2 contributes to the regulation of telomere length.

Liu et al. (2004) found that TIN2 was part of a high molecular mass
protein complex in HeLa cells that mediates telomere end-capping and
length control. Other members of this complex are TRF1, TRF2, RAP1
(TERF2IP; 605061), POT1, and TPP1.

Through reconstitution and fractionation experiments, O'Connor et al.
(2006) found that TPP1 and TIN2 were essential mediators of telomeric
complex formation and that TPP1-TIN2 interaction regulated bridging of
TRF1 and TRF2. Overexpression of TPP1 enhanced TIN2-TRF1 association,
and conversely, knockdown of TPP1 reduced the ability of endogenous TRF1
to associate with the TRF2 complex. O'Connor et al. (2006) concluded
that coordinated interaction among TPP1, TIN2, TRF1, and TRF2 is
required for assembly of the telomere complex and ultimately for
telomere maintenance.

Mammalian telomeres are protected by a 6-protein complex, shelterin.
Shelterin contains 2 closely related proteins, TRF1 and TRF2, which
recruit various proteins to telomeres. Chen et al. (2008) dissected the
interactions of TRF1 and TRF2 with their shared binding partner TIN2 and
other shelterin accessory factors. TRF1 recognizes TIN2 using a
conserved molecular surface in its TRF homology domain. However, this
same surface does not act as a TIN2-binding site in TRF2, and TIN2
binding to TRF2 is mediated by a region outside the TRF homology domain.
Instead, the TRF homology domain docking site of TRF2 binds a shelterin
accessory factor, Apollo, also known as SNM1B (609683), which does not
interact with the TRF homology domain of TRF1. Conversely, the TRF
homology domain of TRF1, but not of TRF2, interacts with another
shelterin-associated factor, PINX1 (606505).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Patients with dyskeratosis congenita (DKC), a heterogeneous inherited
bone marrow failure syndrome, have abnormalities in telomere biology
including very short telomeres. Whereas germline mutations in DKC1
(300126), TERC (602322), and TERT (187270) have been found in DKC
patients, approximately 60% of DKC patients lack an identifiable
mutation. With the very short telomere phenotype and a highly penetrant,
rare disease model, Savage et al. (2008) performed a linkage scan on a
family with autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita-3 (DKCA3; 613990)
in which affected members did not have mutations in DKC1, TERC, or TERT.
Evidence favoring linkage was found at 14q11.2, which led to the
identification of the TINF2 mutations K280E (604319.0001) in the proband
and her 5 affected relatives. Three additional unrelated DKC probands,
including 1 with Revesz syndrome (268130), carried TINF2 R282H
(604319.0002). A fifth DKC proband had an R282S mutation (604319.0003).
All 3 mutations were in extremely close proximity and near the end of
the TRF1 (600951)-binding domain of the TIN2 protein. This study
provided the first example of a shelterin complex mutation linked to
human disease and confirmed the role of very short telomeres as a
diagnostic test for dyskeratosis congenita.

Walne et al. (2008) identified heterozygous mutations in the TINF2 gene
in 33 (18.9%) of 175 cases of uncharacterized DKC. Of these 33 samples,
21 were found to have a mutation in arg282 in exon 6 (see, e.g., R282H;
604319.0002). The remaining 12 mutations were all in a tight cluster
between residues 280 and 298. No additional mutations were found
elsewhere in the gene. Most of the mutations were de novo. Clinically,
all the DKC patients with a TINF2 mutation had severe disease associated
with shorter telomeres compared to patients with DKC1 mutations.

Yang et al. (2011) found that expression of TIN2 with the K280E, R282H,
or R282S mutation in human cell lines recapitulated the telomere
shortening defect in DKC. These mutations did not affect total
telomerase activity, TIN2 localization at telomeres, telomere end
protection, or expression or stability of other core telomeric proteins.
Despite the clustering of these mutation near the TRF1-binding motif,
they did not affect interaction of TIN2 with TRF1. However, all 3
mutations reduced the level of telomerase activity and the amount of
TERC protein that immunoprecipitated with TIN2. Yang et al. (2011)
concluded that mutation of K280 or R282 in TIN2 results in defective
targeting of telomerase to telomere ends.

The 2 truncating mutations identified by Sasa et al. (2012) in 2
unrelated children with severe DKCA3 (Q269X, 604319.0005 and Q271X,
604319.0007, respectively) both occurred in exon 6, but affected the
more N-terminal region compared to earlier reported mutations and thus
extended the affected segment of the gene to amino acid 269. In vitro
functional expression studies in HEK293 cells showed that the Q269X
mutant protein was markedly impaired in its ability to interact with
TERF1. This was in contrast to R282H (604319.0002), which retained
substantial ability to interact with TERF1. These findings indicated
that disrupted TERF1 binding is not the main factor driving disease
pathogenesis, but may contribute to a more severe phenotype.

Vulliamy et al. (2012) identified 16 new families with mutations in exon
6 of the TINF2 gene ascertained from 224 consecutive patients with
different forms of bone marrow failure, including 46 with criteria
meeting dyskeratosis congenita, 122 with aplastic anemia, and 57 with
some features of DKC. Seven of the 46 patients with DKC carried
mutations, 5 of whom had the R252H mutation (604319.0002). Nine of 57
patients with bone marrow failure and some features of DKC were found to
carry mutations, including 2 with R282H, and 4 with nonsense or
frameshift mutations (see, e.g., 604319.0005 and 604319.0008). Telomere
length was only available for 7 of the mutation carriers, 6 of whom had
shortened telomeres. The seventh patient had a missense variant that was
also found in an asymptomatic individual, and both had normal telomere
lengths, suggesting that this variant was not disease causing. Vulliamy
et al. (2012) concluded that TINF2 mutations can cause a spectrum of
clinical features and that telomere length should be able to distinguish
pathogenic mutations from polymorphic variants in the absence of
functional data. Most of the mutations appeared to occur de novo.

TINF2, LYS280GLU

In 4 members of a family with autosomal dominant dyskeratosis
congenita-3 (DKCA3; 613990), Savage et al. (2008) identified
heterozygosity for a A-to-G transition in exon 6 of the TINF2 gene
(Ex6+234A-G) that resulted in a lys-to-glu substitution at codon 280
(K280E). The mutation was also found in 2 family members who were
classified as silent carriers because, while they showed some clinical
features, did not meet the clinical definition of DKC; these 2
individuals as well as the 4 with a DKC diagnosis had telomere lengths
below the first percentile for age.

Yang et al. (2011) showed that the K280E mutation caused defective
targeting of telomerase to telomere ends.

REVESZ SYNDROME, INCLUDED
TINF2, ARG282HIS

In 3 individuals with autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita-3
(613990), Savage et al. (2008) identified heterozygosity for a G-to-A
transition in exon 6 of the TINF2 gene (Ex6+241G-A) that resulted in an
arg282-to-his (R282H) amino acid substitution. Two of these patients had
the 'DKC triad' of abnormal nails, reticular pigmentation, and oral
leukoplakia, with other features; 1 of these patients had Revesz
syndrome (268130). One patient without the DKC triad had dystrophic
nails and IgA deficiency. All 3 patients had telomere lengths below the
first percentile for age.

Tsangaris et al. (2008) identified a de novo heterozygous R282H mutation
in an 18-month-old girl with DKC who presented with pancytopenia and
ataxia. Brain imaging showed cerebellar hypoplasia. She later developed
a small area of leukoplakia, but had no nail dystrophy or skin
hyperpigmentation. Laboratory studies showed shortened telomeres and
decreased telomerase activity (92.5% reduction compared to control
values). The authors noted that the phenotype was consistent with the
ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome (159550), which may be part of the
phenotypic spectrum of DKC.

Yang et al. (2011) showed that the R282H mutation caused defective
targeting of telomerase to telomere ends.

By in vitro functional expression studies in HEK293 cells, Sasa et al.
(2012) demonstrated that the R282H mutant protein retained substantial
ability to interact with TERF1 (600951).

Vulliamy et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous R282H mutation in 7
unrelated patients with DKC. Two had a severe form of the disorder, with
additional features including growth retardation, retinopathy, ataxia,
developmental delay, and cerebellar hypoplasia, consistent with a
clinical diagnosis of Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome. Three patients had
classic DKC, with bone marrow failure and skin and nail involvement; 2
had leukoplakia. The last 2 patients had bone marrow failure with
variable features overlapping DKC, mainly nail dystrophy; 1 had
intracranial calcifications. Telomere length was only available from 4
of these patients, but all showed significantly shortened telomeres. The
findings indicated that TINF2 mutations can be associated with a broad
spectrum of phenotypes.

In a patient with autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita-3 (613990)
and very short telomeres, Savage et al. (2008) identified a C-to-A
transversion in exon 6 of the TINF2 gene (Ex6+240C-A) that resulted in
an arg282-to-ser substitution (R282S).

Yang et al. (2011) showed that the R282S mutation caused defective
targeting of telomerase to telomere ends.

In 7 patients with DKCA3 (613990), Walne et al. (2008) identified a

an arg282-to-cys (R282C) substitution.

TINF2, GLN269TER

In a 4-year-old Hispanic boy with DKCA3 (613990), Sasa et al. (2012)
identified a de novo heterozygous 805C-T transition in exon 6 of the
TINF2 gene, resulting in a gln269-to-ter (Q269X) substitution. He
presented with pancytopenia, and was found to have nail dystrophy, oral
leukoplakia, and lacy hyperpigmentation of the neck and genital regions.
He also had undescended testis and phimosis. Telomere flow-FISH analysis
showed telomere lengths below the first percentile. He underwent
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The truncated protein was
expressed, but at lower levels than wildtype, suggesting decreased
stability. In vitro functional expression studies in HEK293 cells showed
that the Q269X mutant protein was markedly impaired in its ability to
interact with TERF1 (600951). This was in contrast to R282H
(604319.0002), which retained substantial ability to interact with
TERF1. These findings indicated that disrupted TERF1 binding is not the
main factor driving disease pathogenesis, but may contribute to a more
severe phenotype.

Vulliamy et al. (2012) reported a 4-year-old boy with bone marrow
failure and mucocutaneous features of DKC who had a Q269X mutation in
the TINF2 gene. Telomere length was significantly decreased compared to
controls.

REVESZ SYNDROME
TINF2, 1-BP DEL, 839A

In a 21-month-old Hispanic boy with Revesz syndrome (268130), Sasa et
al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (839delA) in exon 6
of the TINF2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination.
The mutation was not present in the mother, but the reportedly normal
father was not available. The child presented with severe aplastic
anemia and was noted to have bilateral exudative retinopathy at age 9
months. He also had poor growth, nail dystrophy, oral leukoplakia, and
delayed development with wide-based gait, suggesting cerebellar
involvement. He underwent cord blood transplantation, but died 92 days
later. Telomere lengths were shortened. A truncated protein was
expressed, but at lower levels than wildtype, suggesting decreased
stability.

a gln271-to-ter (Q271X) substitution. She presented at age 21 months
with severe aplastic anemia and underwent hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation. Subsequently, she developed skin hyperpigmentation,
nail dystrophy, and oral leukoplakia, as well as epiphora, esophageal
stricture, and osteopenia-related fractures. At age 10 years, she had
progressive interstitial lung disease with fibrosis, gastrointestinal
bleeding secondary to enteropathy, and noncirrhotic portal hypertension.
She died at age 12 years from multiorgan failure.

607314	TITLE *607314 CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN 2; CABP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using primers designed from the bovine Cabp2 sequence, Haeseleer et al.
(2000) cloned human CABP2 by PCR with a retina cDNA library. The deduced
221-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 24.8 kD and
contains an N-terminal myristoylation signal and 3 EF-hands that
correspond to EF-hands 1, 3, and 4 of calmodulin (see 114180); EF-hand 2
is partially deleted in CABP2. They also cloned mouse Cabp2 and
identified a shorter variant that encodes a 160-amino acid protein with
a calculated molecular mass of about 18 kD. CABP2 shares 72% similarity
with CABP1 (605563) and 56% similarity with calmodulin. Human CABP2 also
shares 91 to 98% similarity with the bovine and mouse homologs. Northern
blot analysis detected weak expression of 1.5- and 1.3-kb transcripts
only in retina. RT-PCR of several mouse tissues detected expression only
in retina. Sokal et al. (2000) confirmed these results for CABP2
expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Haeseleer et al. (2000) determined that the CABP2 gene contains 6 exons
and spans about 5 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Haeseleer et al. (2000) mapped the CABP2 gene to chromosome
11q13.1. Sokal et al. (2000) noted that the CABP4 gene (608965) also
maps to chromosome 11, but it is at least 40 kb from the CABP2 gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Haeseleer et al. (2000) determined that CABP2 is myristoylated in vitro.
They also found that the short form of CABP2, purified from bovine
retina, stimulated CAMK2 (see 114078) in the presence of Ca(2+). CABP2
also inhibited G protein-coupled receptor kinase-5 (GRK5;
600870)-mediated phosphorylation of rhodopsin (180380), although its
affinity for GRK5 was lower than that shown by CABP1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 unrelated consanguineous Iranian families segregating autosomal
recessive deafness (DFNB93; 614899), Schrauwen et al. (2012) identified
homozygosity for a splice site mutation in the CABP2 gene (607314.0001)
that segregated with disease in each family and was not found in
controls. The mutant protein was shown to have altered Ca(2+) binding in
isothermal titration calorimetry and less potent regulation of Ca(v)1.3
Ca(2+) channels.

CABP2, IVS6DS, G-T, +1

In affected members of 3 unrelated consanguineous Iranian families
segregating autosomal recessive deafness (DFNB93; 614899), Schrauwen et
al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a 637+1G-T transversion at the
5-prime donor site of intron 6 of the CABP2 gene. The mutation
segregated with disease in each family and was not found in 100 Iranian
controls. Haplotype analysis indicated that it was likely a founder
mutation inherited from an ancient common ancestor; the small size of
the shared region suggested that the mutation might be hundreds or even
thousands of years old. Analysis of cDNA prepared from transfected COS-7
cells revealed only a 177-bp PCR product, consistent with complete
skipping of exon 6, which was predicted to result in a frameshift and
premature termination at codon F164 (Phe164Serfs*4). Isothermal
titration calorimetry of wildtype and F164X truncated CABP2 demonstrated
an endothermic Ca(2+)-binding reaction for wildtype CABP2 that was
weaker with the truncated protein, indicating altered Ca(2+) binding
that might interfere with its role as a Ca(2+) sensor. Transfection
studies in HEK293T cells showed that there was weaker suppression of the
negative feedback regulation of Ca(v)1.3 Ca(2+) channels with mutant
CABP2 than with wildtype; in addition, wildtype CABP2 significantly
inhibited current density, whereas the mutant had no effect.

;;LYSOPHOSPHATIDIC ACID-SPECIFIC PHOSPHATASE; LPAP;;
ACID PHOSPHATASE-LIKE 1; ACPL1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hiroyama and Takenawa (1998) purified Acp6 from bovine brain. By PCR of
a human brain cDNA library using degenerate primers for bovine Acp6 and
prostatic acid phosphatase (ACPP; 171790), Hiroyama and Takenawa (1999)
cloned ACP6, which they called LPAP. Two initiation codons were
identified, resulting in proteins of 428 and 421 amino acids,
respectively, and the authors reported that the second ATG was the
initiation codon in ACP6. The protein has a signal sequence and an
N-terminal consensus sequence shared by a group of acid phosphatases,
and it shares 28.5% amino acid identity with ACPP. Northern blot
analysis detected a 1.75-kb transcript in all tissues examined with
higher expression in kidney, heart, small intestine, muscle, and liver.
They showed that ACP6 was localized to mitochondria by signal peptides
and regulated the biosynthesis of mitochondrial lipids by hydrolyzing
lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to monoacylglycerol.

Takayama et al. (2002) cloned mouse and human ACP6, which they called
ACPL1. The deduced 428-amino acid human protein shares 77% amino acid
identity with its mouse homolog. Northern blot analysis detected
expression in all human tissues analyzed, with higher expression in
prostate, testis, small intestine, and colon. In transfected COS-7
cells, tagged ACP6 was observed mainly in the cytoplasm. Interstitial
cells of Cajal (ICC) within the small intestines of wildtype mice
expressed mRNA for Acp6 and Kit (164920), and differential gene display
indicated that expression of Acp6 was significantly suppressed in W/Wv
mice, which have reduced Kit function and ICC populations, compared to
wildtype.

MAPPING

By FISH, Hiroyama and Takenawa (1999) mapped the ACP6 gene to chromosome

603436	TITLE *603436 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 205; ZNF205
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 210; ZNF210
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The largest family of zinc finger proteins is the C2H2, or Kruppel,
type. See 165220. Some members of the Kruppel family contain a conserved
KRAB region that can be divided into 2 subregions, the A box and the B
box. See 601742. While constructing a transcript map of the critical
region of familial Mediterranean fever (see MEFV; 608107), Deng et al.
(1998) isolated cDNAs encoding ZNF205, which they designated ZNF210.
Sequence analysis indicated that the predicted 504-amino acid protein is
a Kruppel-type zinc finger protein that contains a KRAB A box N-terminal
to 8 zinc finger motifs. Northern blot analysis revealed that the 2.2-kb
ZNF210 mRNA was expressed in all tissues tested. An additional
transcript was detected in a number of tissues.

MAPPING

By analysis of clones from the MEFV region, Deng et al. (1998)
determined that the ZNF205 gene is located approximately 120 kb from the
MEFV gene on 16p13.3. They reported that 4 other zinc finger genes are
located in the MEFV region, including ZNF200 (603231), ZNF174, and
FPM315.

608507	TITLE *608507 MITOFUSIN 2; MFN2
;;KIAA0214
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The size and arrangement of mitochondria differs with cell type,
physiologic condition, and pathologic state. Mitofusins, such as MFN2,
mediate the fusion of mitochondria and thereby contribute to the dynamic
balance between fusion and fission that determines mitochondria
morphology (Santel and Fuller, 2001).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated immature myeloid
cell line cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned MFN2, which they
designated KIAA0214. The deduced 757-amino acid protein contains an
ATP/GTP-binding site motif. Northern blot analysis detected expression
of MFN2 in all tissues and cell lines examined, with highest expression
in heart and skeletal muscle.

By searching EST databases, Santel and Fuller (2001) found that KIAA0214
showed significant similarity to the Drosophila mitochondria fusion
gene, Fzo, and they further characterized the cDNA clone. The deduced
757-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal GTPase domain and a
transmembrane domain near the C terminus. MFN2 shares 60% identity with
MFN1 (608506), with the most extensive homology in the GTPase domains.
The N- and C-terminal ends are more variable. When stably expressed in
COS-7 cells, MFN2 colocalized with mitochondrial markers. An internal
region, including the predicted bipartite transmembrane domain, was
sufficient to target MFN2 to mitochondria.

Bach et al. (2003) cloned rat Mfn2, which shares 95% identity to human
MFN2. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected a 4.7-kb
transcript expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle and heart, and at
lower levels in brain, kidney, and liver. Little to no expression was
detected in other tissues. Very little Mfn2 was expressed in a rat
myoblast cell line, but expression was induced following differentiation
into myotubes. Western blot analysis detected rat Mfn2 at an apparent
molecular mass of 110 kD in heart, skeletal muscle, brown adipose
tissue, and kidney. Endogenous Mfn2 was enriched in mitochondrial
fractions of these tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Casasnovas et al. (2010) noted that the MFN2 gene contains 19 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and by examining a human-rodent hybrid
panel, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the MFN2 gene to chromosome 1.

Zuchner et al. (2004) stated that the MFN2 gene maps to chromosome
1p36.2, about 1.65 Mb centromeric to the KIF1B gene (605995), which is
mutant in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-2A1 (CMT2A1; 118210).

GENE FUNCTION

Santel and Fuller (2001) found that overexpression of MFN2 caused
perinuclear mitochondrial clustering. Mutation analysis revealed that
the C-terminal coiled-coil domain mediated mitochondrial clustering, and
the GTPase domain mediated mitochondrial fusion. Furthermore, a
GTPase-dead DRP1 (603850) caused similar mitochondrial clustering in
transfected COS-7 cells, and COS-7 cells cotransfected with the
GTPase-dead DRP1 and MFN2 developed mitochondrial filaments and networks
that extended from the perinuclear mitochondrial cluster toward the cell
periphery. Santel and Fuller (2001) concluded that the size and
morphologic arrangement of mitochondria are due to a dynamic balance
between MFN-dependent mitochondrial fusion and DRP1-dependent
mitochondrial fission.

Bach et al. (2003) found that the induction of Mfn2 during
differentiation in a rat myogenic cell line into myotubes paralleled the
development of an extensive mitochondrial network. Overexpression of
Mfn2 collapsed the network and mitochondria clustered around the
nucleus. Knock-down of Mfn2 expression in muscle cells with mouse Mfn2
antisense sequence led to fragmentation of the mitochondrial network
into independent clusters and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential.
Reduced Mfn2 expression in rat myotubes and mouse fibroblasts was
associated with a 30% reduction of glucose oxidation. Repression of Mfn2
expression also reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and cell
respiration, and reduced mitochondrial proton leak. Bach et al. (2003)
further found that Mfn2 expression was repressed in obesity, being
reduced by 34% in muscle from obese rats, and reduced by 36% in muscle
of obese human subjects. Expression in mitochondrial fractions was 39%
lower in obese rats, and 43% lower in obese humans in comparison with
lean controls. Bach et al. (2003) concluded that MFN2 expression is
crucial in mitochondrial metabolism through the maintenance of the
mitochondrial network architecture, and reduced MFN2 expression may
explain some of the metabolic alterations associated with obesity.

Pich et al. (2005) showed that Mfn2 loss of function inhibited pyruvate,
glucose, and fatty acid oxidation and reduced mitochondrial membrane
potential, whereas Mfn2 gain of function increased glucose oxidation and
mitochondrial membrane potential. Mfn2 loss of function repressed
nuclear-encoded subunits of OXPHOS complexes I, II, III and V, whereas
Mfn2 overexpression induced the subunits of complexes I, IV, and V.
Obesity-induced Mfn2 deficiency in rat skeletal muscle was also
associated with a decrease in the subunits of complexes I, II, III, and
V. In addition, the effect of Mfn2 overexpression on mitochondrial
metabolism was mimicked by a truncated Mfn2 mutant that was inactive as
a mitochondrial fusion protein. Pich et al. (2005) concluded that Mfn2
triggers mitochondrial energization, at least in part, by regulating
OXPHOS expression through signals that are independent of its role as a
mitochondrial fusion protein.

Two members of the BCL2 family, BAX (600040) and BAK (600516), change
intracellular location early in the promotion of apoptosis to
concentrate in focal clusters at sites of mitochondrial division.
Karbowski et al. (2006) reported that in healthy cells, BAX or BAK is
required for normal fusion of mitochondria into elongated tubules. BAX
seems to induce mitochondrial fusion by activating assembly of the large
GTPase MFN2 and changing its submitochondrial distribution and membrane
mobility--properties that correlate with different GTP-bound states of
MFN2. Karbowski et al. (2006) concluded that BAX and BAK regulate
mitochondrial dynamics in healthy cells and that BCL2 family members may
also regulate apoptosis through organelle morphogenesis machineries.

Guo et al. (2007) found that a variety of apoptotic stimuli induced
expression of Mfn2 in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).
Overexpression of Mfn2 triggered apoptosis of VSMCs in culture and in
balloon-injured rat carotid arteries, which helped prevent neointima
formation after angioplasty. Conversely, Mfn2 silencing protected VSMCs
against H2O2- or Mfn2 overexpression-induced apoptosis. The proapoptotic
effect of Mfn2 was independent of its role in mitochondrial fusion and
was mediated by inhibition of Akt (see AKT1; 164730) signaling,
resulting in activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.
Mfn2-induced apoptosis was blocked by overexpression of an active
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (see PIK3CG; 601232) mutant or inhibition of
Bclxl (600039) or caspase-9 (CASP9; 602234). Guo et al. (2007) concluded
that, in addition to its antiproliferative effects, MFN2 is a primary
determinant of VSMC apoptosis.

De Brito and Scorrano (2008) showed that MFN2 is enriched at the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria interface. Ablation or silencing
of Mfn2 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and HeLa cells disrupted ER
morphology and loosened ER-mitochondria interactions, thereby reducing
the efficiency of mitochondrial calcium uptake in response to stimuli
that generate inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate. An in vitro assay as well as
genetic and biochemical evidences supported a model in which Mfn2 on the
ER bridges the 2 organelles by engaging in homotypic and heterotypic
complexes with Mfn1 (608506) or Mfn2 on the surface of mitochondria.
Thus, de Brito and Scorrano (2008) concluded that Mfn2 tethers ER to
mitochondria, a juxtaposition required for efficient mitochondrial
calcium uptake.

Chen and Dorn (2013) demonstrated that the mitochondrial outer membrane
guanosine triphosphatase MFN2 mediates parkin (602544) recruitment to
damaged mitochondria. Parkin bound to MFN2 in a PINK1 (608309)-dependent
manner; PINK1 phosphorylated MFN2 and promoted its parkin-mediated
ubiquitination. Ablation of Mfn2 in mouse cardiac myocytes prevented
depolarization-induced translocation of parkin to the mitochondria and
suppressed mitophagy. Accumulation of morphologically and functionally
abnormal mitochondria induced respiratory dysfunction in Mfn2-deficient
mouse embryonic fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes and in parkin-deficient
Drosophila heart tubes, causing dilated cardiomyopathy. Thus, Chen and
Dorn (2013) concluded that MFN2 functions as a mitochondrial receptor
for parkin and is required for quality control of cardiac mitochondria.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of several families with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease-2A2 (CMT2A2; 609260), Zuchner et al. (2004) identified mutations
in the MFN2 gene (608507.0001-608507.0006).

Kijima et al. (2005) studied the MFN2 gene in 81 Japanese patients with
axonal or unclassified CMT and detected 7 mutations in 7 unrelated
patients. Six mutations were novel, and 1 was a de novo mutation. Most
mutations were located within or immediately upstream of the GTPase
domain or within 2 coiled-coil domains critical for mitochondrial
targeting of MFN2. Kijima et al. (2005) stated that formation of the
mitochondrial network would be required to maintain the functional
peripheral nerve axon.

In affected members of 6 unrelated families with hereditary motor and
sensory neuropathy with optic atrophy (HMSN6; 601152), Zuchner et al.
(2006) identified 6 different heterozygous mutations in the MFN2 gene
(see, e.g., 608507.0009-608607.0012).

Chung et al. (2006) identified 10 pathogenic MFN2 mutations (see, e.g.,
608507.0004; 608507.0009; 608507.0011) in 26 patients from 15 (24.2%) of
62 Korean families with CMT2A2 or HMSN VI. There were 2 main groups of
patients, including those with early onset before 10 years and those
with late onset after age 10 years. Those with early onset had a severe
disorder, often with scoliosis and contractures, whereas those with
later onset had a milder disorder and a higher frequency of unusual
findings such as tremor, pain, and hearing loss. The severity of the
disorder tended to be the same within families, suggesting a
genotype/phenotype correlation.

In fibroblasts derived from CMT2A2 patients with MFN2 mutations (see,
e.g., R94Q, 608507.0001), Guillet et al. (2010) found an uncoupling of
mitochondrial oxygen consumption and decreased efficiency of oxygen
utilization, but normal ATP production. Normal ATP production was
maintained by an increased respiration rate, mainly involving complex II
proteins. Mutant fibroblasts also showed overexpression and increased
activity of ANT3 (SLC25A6; 300151), which was believed to result in
reduced efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. The findings suggested
that MFN2 plays a role in controlling ATP/ADP exchange in mitochondria.

Calvo et al. (2009) identified 20 different missense mutations,
including 10 novel mutations, in the MFN2 gene in 20 of 150 probands
with CMT and a nerve conduction velocity (NCV) of 25 m/s or greater.
Eighteen of the patients had been previously reported. The mutation
frequency in CMT2 was 17.8% (19 of 107 patients) and in CMT1 was 2.3% (1
of 43). Four patients had proven de novo mutations, 8 families had
autosomal dominant inheritance, and 3 had autosomal recessive
inheritance; the remaining 5 patients were sporadic cases with
heterozygous mutations. The phenotypes varied from mild forms to
early-onset severe forms, and additional features, such as pyramidal
signs or vasomotor dysfunction, were encountered in 8 patients (32%).
The study indicated that MFN2 mutations are a frequent cause of CMT2,
with variable severity and either dominant or recessive inheritance.
Calvo et al. (2009) suggested that testing for mutations in MFN2 showed
be a first-line analysis in axonal CMT regardless of the mode of
inheritance or the severity of the peripheral neuropathy.

Casasnovas et al. (2010) identified 9 different heterozygous MFN2
mutations, including 4 novel mutations, in 24 patients from 14 different
Spanish families with CMT2A2. Six (42.8%) of 14 families carried the
same mutation (R468H; 608507.0015). Overall, MFN2 mutations were
identified in 16% of the total cohort of 85 Spanish families with axonal
CMT, and Casasnovas et al. (2010) concluded that MFN2 is the most
frequent cause of axonal CMT in this population.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chen et al. (2003) found that both Mfn1- and Mfn2-deficient mice died in
midgestation. Whereas Mfn2 mutant embryos showed disruption of the
placental trophoblast giant cell layer, Mfn1-deficient giant cells were
normal. Embryonic fibroblasts lacking Mfn displayed fragmented
mitochondria due to severe reduction in mitochondrial fusion. Mfn1 and
Mfn2 formed homotypic and heterotypic complexes, and rescue of mutant
cells indicated that the homotypic complexes were functional for fusion.
A subset of mitochondria in mutant cells also lost membrane potential.
The authors concluded that Mfn1 and Mfn2 have both redundant and
distinct functions and act in 3 separate molecular complexes to promote
mitochondrial fusion.

Detmer et al. (2008) generated transgenic mice expressing a pathogenic
Mfn2 T105M mutation in peripheral motor neurons. Mutant mice developed
key clinical features of CMT2A in a dose-dependent manner. Homozygous
mice had a severe gait defect from birth due to an inability to
dorsiflex the hindpaws, and they consequently dragged their hindpaws
while walking and supported themselves on the hind knuckles, rather than
the soles. Anterior calf muscles showed severe atrophy. There was
decreased penetrance of the defects as well as lack of progression.
Histologic studies showed reduced numbers of motor axons in the motor
roots and improper mitochondrial distribution with tight clusters of
mitochondria within axons. Homozygous mice had drastically short tails
that were deformed, whereas heterozygous mice had shorter tails with
mild to moderate bony kinks or thickening.

Fyfe et al. (2011) used genomewide linkage analysis followed by
candidate gene sequencing to identify a homozygous 3-bp deletion in the
canine Mfn2 gene as causative of a severe autosomal recessive form of
fetal-onset neuroaxonal dystrophy. The in-frame 3-bp deletion was
predicted to result in the deletion of a conserved glu539 residue.
Mutant mRNA was expressed, but mutant protein was nearly undetectable on
Western blot analysis of dog tissues. Immunohistochemical studies of
normal pup brainstem showed robust granular cytoplasmic staining of Mfn2
in cerebellar Purkinje cells, deep cerebellar nuclei, and most large
neurons in identified nuclei. The phenotype was characterized by death
at birth due to respiratory failure. Affected fetuses had swollen
axons/spheroids throughout the extrapyramidal motor system of the
brainstem, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves, as well as cerebellar
hypoplasia. Axonal swelling was composed of membrane-bound fragments of
variably degenerated mitochondria and other tubulofilamentous material.
The phenotype was reminiscent of human neuroaxonal dystrophy (256600)
caused by mutation in the PLA2G6 gene (603604); however, brain iron
accumulation was not observed in canines with the Mfn2 mutation.

In a patient with early-onset CMT2A2 (609260), Zuchner et al. (2004)
identified a heterozygous 280C-T transition in exon 4 of the MFN2 gene,
resulting in an arg94-to-trp (R94W) substitution. A different mutation
affecting the same codon (R94Q; 608507.0001) was identified in another
family.

Zuchner et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous R94W mutation in an
African American mother and daughter with hereditary motor and sensory
neuropathy with optic atrophy (HMSN6; 601152). Both patients had early
onset of axonal neuropathy, at ages 8 and 3 years, respectively, and
late onset of optic atrophy, at ages 50 and 40 years, respectively.

a gln276-to-arg (Q276R) substitution. The patient's mother and sister
both carried the mutation, but only had peripheral neuropathy without
optic atrophy. Zuchner et al. (2006) suggested incomplete penetrance.

CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2A2, INCLUDED
MFN2, ARG364TRP

In a father and 2 sons with HMSN VI (601152), Zuchner et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous 1090C-T transition in exon 11 of the MFN2
gene, resulting in an arg364-to-trp (R364W) substitution. All patients
had a severe form of the disorder with neuropathy developing by age 1
year and optic atrophy by age 10 years.

Chung et al. (2006) reported 4 unrelated Korean families with
early-onset neuropathy before 10 years of age and a heterozygous R364W
mutation. In 1 family, only 1 of 3 mutation carriers had optic atrophy.
In another family, both mutation carriers had optic atrophy. Optic
atrophy was not present in the remaining 2 families, more consistent
with a diagnosis of CMT2A2 (609260). All except 1 patient had scoliosis
and most had contractures.

resulting in a thr206-to-ile (T206I) substitution.

.0013
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2A2
MFN2, ARG707TRP

In a woman with early-onset severe axonal neuropathy (609260), Nicholson
et al. (2008) identified a homozygous 2119C-T transition in the MFN2
gene, resulting in an arg707-to-trp (R707W) substitution in a highly
conserved residue. Each parent was heterozygous for the mutation and
showed a mild form of peripheral neuropathy. Nicholson et al. (2008)
noted that the apparent autosomal recessive inheritance of the disorder
in this family was actually semidominant and that the parents showed
incomplete penetrance. The homozygous mutation in the daughter resulted
from the combined effect of 2 mutations and a more severe phenotype with
earlier onset.

MFN2, ARG104TRP

In an Italian father and 2 sons with peripheral neuropathy, Del Bo et
al. (2008) identified a heterozygous 310C-T transition in exon 4 of the
MFN2 gene, resulting in an arg104-to-trp (R104W) substitution in a
highly conserved residue in the GTPase domain. The phenotype was highly
variable within the family. The father had a symmetric axonal
predominantly motor polyneuropathy, spastic gait, and pes cavus,
consistent with CMT2A2 (609260), as well as impaired nocturnal vision
and sensorineural hearing loss, consistent with HMSN6 (601152). He also
showed cognitive decline first noted in his forties. Both sons had
delayed motor and language development, decreased IQ, steppage gait,
distal muscle weakness and atrophy, and axonal sensorimotor neuropathy
at ages 10 and 7 years, respectively. One son also had optic nerve
dysfunction. MR spectroscopy (MRS) in the father suggested a defect in
mitochondrial energy metabolism in the occipital cortex. Del Bo et al.
(2008) suggested that central nervous system involvement and cognitive
impairment may be other phenotypic features of MFN2 mutations.

substitution, in affected members of 6 (42.8%) of 14 unrelated Spanish
families with autosomal dominant CMT2A2 (609260). All patients with the
R468H mutation had either mild or moderate disease that presented late
in adult life in the third to fifth decade. Fibroblasts from 1 patient
with the R468H mutation showed a mitochondrial coupling defect, a 50%
decrease in ATP production, and an increase of the respiration rate
linked to complex II.

In 3 sibs with a severe form of adult-onset CMT2A2 (608260) who all
developed a fatal subacute encephalopathy, Boaretto et al. (2010)
identified a heterozygous T-to-C transition (1392+2T-C) in intron 13 of
the MFN2 gene. Their father had died at age 61 of a similar disorder.
The mutation was not found in 200 control chromosomes, but was present
in an unaffected 64-year-old sister, indicating incomplete penetrance.
RT-PCR analysis showed that the splice site mutation resulted in 4
aberrant MFN2 transcripts and completely abolished correct splicing of
exon 13. There were different splicing patterns in the cell lines,
suggesting that activation of cryptic splice sites may be under control
of tissue-specific factors. Boaretto et al. (2010) noted the unusual
encephalopathy present in this family, and suggested that the nature of
the mutation may have put sensitive areas of the brain in a precarious
energetic equilibrium. However, unknown genetic, epigenetic factors, or
environmental factors likely played a role in the phenotype.

CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2A2, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
MFN2, PHE216SER

In 2 British sibs with autosomal recessive inheritance of severe
early-onset CMT2A2 (609260), Polke et al. (2011) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the MFN2 gene: a 647T-C transition in
exon 7, resulting in a phe216-to-ser (F216S) substitution on the
maternal allele, and a deletion of exons 7 and 8 (608507.0018) on the
paternal allele. Transcript analysis showed low levels of a shortened
transcript from the paternal allele, in which exon 6 was spliced to exon
9, suggested that some of the mutant transcript was subject to
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. If translated, the deletion transcript
would result in a truncated out-of-frame protein lacking several
important domains. Thus, it could represent either a null mutation or
have a dominant-negative effect with reduced penetrance if coexpressed
with a normal allele. The patients had onset at 12 and 18 months,
respectively, of foot drop associated with marked upper and lower limb
muscle weakness. Pinprick sensation was decreased, whereas vibration
sense was basically preserved. One patient had optic atrophy and the
other had pale optic disc; both were wheelchair-bound later in
childhood. Each parent was clinically unaffected.

MFN2, THR362MET

In a Korean mother and daughter with CMT2A2 (609260), Chung et al.
(2006) identified a heterozygous 1085C-T transition in the MFN2 gene,
resulting in a thr362-to-met (T362M) substitution. The patients had late
onset and a mild phenotype.

In 2 adult Italian sibs with autosomal recessive inheritance of severe
early-onset CMT2A2 (609260), Polke et al. (2011) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the MFN2 gene: a T362M substitution on
the maternal allele, and a 3-bp in-frame deletion (113delAGA;
608507.0020) resulting in a deletion of lys38 (lys38del), presumably
from the paternal allele, although no DNA was available from the
deceased father. The patients had onset of foot drop and upper and lower
limb weakness at age 3 years. They also had decreased pinprick and
vibration senses, more severe in the lower limbs, kyphosis, pale optic
discs, visual loss, severe facial weakness, and respiratory muscle
weakness. One had hearing loss and vocal cord palsy. Both were
wheelchair-bound. Nerve conduction studies showed absence of nerve
conduction in 1 patient tested. Neither parent was affected. Polke et
al. (2011) noted that the T362M mutation had also been reported in
families with dominant transmission, suggesting that it has a
dominant-negative effect; the pathogenic effect of the lys38 deletion
mutation was unknown, although it was not found in 550 control
chromosomes.

146740	TITLE *146740 Fc FRAGMENT OF IgG, LOW AFFINITY IIIa, RECEPTOR FOR; FCGR3A
;;IMMUNOGLOBULIN G Fc RECEPTOR III-2;;
FCRIII-2;;
CD16A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Fc receptor with low affinity for IgG (FCGR3, or CD16) is encoded by
2 nearly identical genes, FCGR3A and FCGR3B (610665), resulting in
tissue-specific expression of alternative membrane-anchored isoforms.
FCGR3A encodes a transmembrane protein expressed on activated
monocytes/macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and a subset of T
cells. In contrast, FCGR3B encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored protein that is expressed constitutively by neutrophils
and after gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) stimulation by eosinophils
(summary by Gessner et al., 1995).

CLONING

By Western blot and flow cytometric analyses, Ravetch and Perussia
(1989) demonstrated differential expression of FCGR3 on
polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and NK cells. The glycoprotein on
NK cells (FCGR3A) had a molecular mass 6 to 10 kD larger than that on
neutrophils (FCGR3B) and was resistant to phosphatidylinositol-specific
phospholipase C. Transcripts derived from FCGR3A and FCGR3B in NK cells
and PMNs, respectively, have multiple single nucleotide differences,
including 1 that converts a termination codon to a codon encoding arg,
thereby extending the cytoplasmic domain by 21 amino acids and
introducing a transmembrane anchor for FCGR3A in NK cells. The deduced
FCGR3A protein contains 254 amino acids, whereas the deduced FCGR3B
protein contains 233 amino acids. Ravetch and Perussia (1989) concluded
that cell type-specific expression of 2 genes encoding alternative FCGR3
proteins has a significant effect on the biologic functions of the
molecules.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gessner et al. (1995) isolated and sequenced genomic clones of FCGR3A
and FCGR3B, located their transcription initiation sites, identified the
different organizations of their 5-prime regions, and demonstrated 4
distinct classes of FCGR3A transcripts compared with a single class of
FCGR3B transcripts. The gene promoters displayed different
tissue-specific transcriptional activities reflecting expression of
FCGR3A in NK cells and FCGR3B in neutrophils.

MAPPING

Le Coniat et al. (1990) mapped the FCGR3A gene to chromosome 1q23 by in
situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Anderson et al. (1990) concluded that CD16 is included in the zeta
natural killer cell receptor complex (CD3Z; 186780).

Some gamma-delta T cells (see TCRG, 186970 and TCRD, 186810) express
CD16. Using flow cytometric analysis, Bodman-Smith et al. (2000)
examined the relative proportions of CD16+ gamma-delta T cells in the
blood and synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) patients
and the blood of control subjects. There was a significant reduction in
CD16+ gamma-delta T cells in synovial fluid compared with the
circulation. Mitogenic stimulation of circulating gamma-delta T cells
resulted in an increased expression of the HLA-DR activation marker and
a concomitant time-dependent decrease in the expression of CD16.
Bodman-Smith et al. (2000) concluded that CD16 expression is lost in the
synovial compartment as a result of activation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

On the natural killer (NK) cells of a 3-year-old boy who suffered from
recurrent viral respiratory tract infections since birth, de Vries et
al. (1996) found an unusual CD16 phenotype. The child also had severe
clinical problems with BCG vaccination and after Epstein-Barr virus and
varicella-zoster virus infections. His peripheral blood lymphocytes
contained a normal percentage and absolute number of CD3(-)CD7(+) cells,
which were positively stained with CD16 monoclonal antibodies. FCGR3
expression on granulocytes appeared to be normal. Sequence analysis of
the FCGR3A gene, encoding CD16 on NK cells and macrophages, showed a
T-to-A nucleotide substitution at position 230 on both alleles,
predicting a leucine to histidine amino acid change at position 48
(146740.0002).

By cloning and sequencing FCGR3A cDNA from NK cells and macrophages of a
heterozygous donor, de Haas et al. (1996) identified a 230T-G SNP that
resulted in a leu48-to-arg (L48R) substitution in the first
extracellular Ig-like domain and caused a higher electrophoretic
mobility of deglycosylated FCGR3A. PCR and restriction analysis
identified a 230T-A SNP, resulting in a leu48-to-his (L48H)
substitution, in another donor. Genotype analysis revealed a gene
frequency of 86% for 230T (L48), 6% for 230G (R48), and 8% for 230A
(H48) in 93 FCGR3B-positive individuals. In contrast, the frequency of
the 230G allele was significantly higher in 12 FCGR3B-deficient donors.
The H48 and R48 variants exhibited a higher binding capacity for IgG1,
IgG3, and IgG4 than did the common L48 variant. De Haas et al. (1996)
concluded that SNPs at position 230 of FCGR3A influence IgG binding, as
well as reactivity of CD16 monoclonal antibodies.

Koene et al. (1997) used PCR-based restriction analysis to genotype 87
donors for a 559T-G SNP in FCGR3A that results in a phe158-to-val
(F158V) substitution. They found gene frequencies of 57% and 43% for
F158 and V158, respectively. F158 was linked to L48, and V158 was linked
to R48 or H48. Through functional analysis, Koene et al. (1997)
determined that the previously identified differences in IgG binding
among the 3 FCGR3A variants at position 48 are a consequence of the
linked polymorphism at position 158.

Among 1,115 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) and 654
controls, Robinson et al. (2012) found no significant association
between FCGR3A copy number and disease.

Although nearly all adults have been exposed to herpes simplex virus
(HSV)-1, the clinical course of infection varies remarkably. By
analyzing the contribution of gene families on chromosomes 1, 6, 12, and
19 to susceptibility to HSV-1 infection in 302 individuals, Moraru et
al. (2012) identified no specific susceptibility locus. However, they
found that the risk of suffering clinical HSV-1 infection was modified
by MHC class I allotypes, HLA-C1 (142840) interaction with KIR2DL2
(604937), and the phe/val polymorphism at codon 158 of CD16A.

EVOLUTION

By determining the nature and rate of copy number variation (CNV)
mutation and investigating the global variation of disease-associated
variation at the FCGR locus, Machado et al. (2012) determined that CNV
of the FCGR3 genes is mediated by recurrent nonallelic homologous
recombination between the 2 segmental duplications that carry FCGR3A and
FCGR3B. They showed that pathogen richness, particularly helminth
pathogens, is likely to have influenced the patterns of variation in
FCGRs in humans. Machado et al. (2012) proposed that alterations to IgG
binding in the context of helminth infection have driven positive
selection in FCGR among different mammalian species, linking
evolutionary pressure of helminth infection with autoimmune disease via
adaptation at the genetic level. This model supports the 'hygiene
hypothesis,' which states that in the absence of chronic helminth
infection in modern populations, previously selected alleles respond to
immune system challenges differently and therefore may alter
susceptibility to autoimmune disease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) found that Fcrg (FCER1G; 147139) -/-
mice showed reduced mortality in an acute peritonitis model caused by
cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) compared with wildtype mice. The
reduced mortality in Fcrg -/- mice was associated with lower serum and
peritoneal Tnf (191160) and significantly increased capacity of
neutrophils and macrophages to phagocytose E. coli. Fcgr3 -/- mice also
had reduced sepsis after CLP. Fcgr3 bound E. coli, inducing Fcrg
phosphorylation, recruitment of tyrosine phosphatase Shp1 (PTPN6;
176883), and dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K;
see 171834). Decreased Pi3k activity inhibited E. coli phagocytosis and
increased Tnf production through Tlr4 (603030). Confocal microscopy
demonstrated negative regulation of Marco (604870) by Fcrg. Interaction
of E. coli with Fcgr3 induced recruitment of Shp1 to Marco and inhibited
E. coli phagocytosis. Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) concluded that
binding of E. coli to FCGR3 triggers an inhibitory FCRG pathway that

In a 3-year-old boy who had suffered from recurrent viral respiratory
tract infections since birth, de Vries et al. (1996) found an unusual
CD16 phenotype on the natural killer (NK) cells. Sequence analysis of
the IGFR3 gene showed a T-to-A nucleotide substitution at position 230
on both alleles, predicting a leucine-to-histidine amino acid change at
position 48 in the first extracellular Ig-like domain of the FCGR3A
protein. The child had also had severe problems with BCG vaccination and
with Epstein-Barr virus and varicella-zoster virus infections. The
clinical pattern was considered compatible with an in vivo dysfunction
of NK cells. Only 1 patient with absolute NK cell deficiency had been
previously described. Biron et al. (1989) reported the case of an
adolescent with recurrent life-threatening herpesvirus infections, who
completely lacked CD16 and/or CD56 positive cells in vivo and
NK-activity in vitro. In a note added in proof, de Vries et al. (1996)
called attention to the case of homozygosity for a IGFR3 mutation
reported by Jawahar et al. (1996).

608213	TITLE *608213 CELL CYCLE EXIT AND NEURONAL DIFFERENTIATION 1; CEND1
;;BM88 ANTIGEN; BM88
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to porcine Bm88,
Gaitanou et al. (2001) identified several ESTs for BM88 from an infant
brain cDNA library, and they cloned the cDNA by PCR. The deduced
149-amino acid BM88 protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 15
kD. It has a central proline-rich region containing 4 PxxP motifs, which
typically bind SRC (190090) homology-3 (SH3) domains, a putative
C-terminal transmembrane region, and several potential sites for
N-glycosylation, myristoylation, and phosphorylation. BM88 shares 79.9%
and 76.4% amino acid identity with mouse and porcine Bm88, respectively.
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.8-kb transcript expressed in mouse
and human whole brain and in all specific human brain regions examined.
Much less BM88 was expressed in spinal cord, and no expression was
detected in HeLa cells. Western blot analysis determined that the BM88
protein has an apparent molecular mass of about 23 kD. Following
nonreducing SDS-PAGE, the apparent molecular mass was about 46 kD,
suggesting that, like the porcine homolog, BM88 forms a dimer of 2
identical polypeptides linked by disulfide bridges. Immunofluorescence
localization of BM88 in transfected COS-7 cells revealed a punctate
staining pattern consistent with mitochondrial and vesicular
localization. Immunohistochemical staining of human cerebellum revealed
strong immunoreactivity in the molecular layer, the Purkinje cell layer,
and in granule neurons of the internal granular layer, but white matter
remained largely unstained.

Politis et al. (2007) showed that forced expression of BM88 in the
neural tube of chicken embryos had a strong antiproliferative effect,
causing neural precursors to prematurely exit the cell cycle and commit
to specific differentiation pathways. Conversely, downregulation of Bm88
by small interfering RNA in mouse spinal cord neural progenitor cells
enhanced proliferation and impaired neuronal differentiation. Politis et
al. (2007) concluded that BM88 is involved in synchronization of cell
cycle exit and differentiation of neuronal precursors in the developing
nervous system.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and by FISH, Gaitanou et al. (2001) mapped
the BM88 gene to chromosome 11p15.5.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Creatine kinases (CKs; EC 2.7.3.2) catalyze the reversible transfer of
high energy phosphate from ATP to creatine, generating ADP and
phosphocreatine. CK isoenzymes are crucial to energy metabolism,
particularly in tissues with high energy requirements. Nuclear genes
encode 4 CK subunits: cytoplasmic muscle (CKM; 123310), cytoplasmic
brain (CKB; 123280), ubiquitous mitochondrial (CKMT1B), and sarcomeric
mitochondrial (CKMTS; 123295) (Klein et al., 1991). A nearly identical
copy of CKMT1B, designated CKMT1A (613415), is telomeric to CKMT1B on
chromosome 15 (Zhang et al., 2007).

CLONING

Haas et al. (1989) cloned CKMT1B, which they called placental MTCK, from
a human placenta cDNA library. The deduced 416-amino acid protein
contains a 38-amino acid N-terminal mitochondrial targeting and import
signal and an active site, cys278. In vitro-translated placental MTCK
was translocated into rat liver mitochondria and proteolytically
processed into smaller intermediate and mature forms. Northern blot
analysis using a placental MTCK-specific probe detected expression in
small intestine and placenta, but not in skeletal muscle, ventricle, and
liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Bark (1980) observed appearance of mitochondrial creatine kinase in the
serum of patients with profound shock, which in most of the patients was
fatal.

Human NDPKD (NME4; 601818) and MTCK are basic peripheral membrane
proteins with symmetrical homooligomeric structures. Using lipid
dilution assays, Epand et al. (2007) showed that NDPKD and ubiquitous
MTCK facilitated lipid transfer from one bilayer to another. Lipid
transfer occurred between liposomes mimicking the lipid composition of
mitochondrial contact sites, containing 30 mol % cardiolipin, but
transfer did not occur when cardiolipin was replaced by
phosphatidylglycerol. Ubiquitous MTCK, but not NDPKD, showed some
specificity in lipids transferred, and it was not active with
phosphatidylcholine alone. Ubiquitous MTCK underwent reversible
oligomerization between dimeric and octameric forms, but only the
octamer bridged membranes and promoted lipid transfer. Lipid transfer
did not involve vesicle fusion or loss of internal contents of the
liposomes.

Using Western blot analysis and confocal immunohistochemistry,
Schlattner et al. (2002) investigated the localization of creatine
kinases in mouse and human skin under healthy and pathologic conditions.
In mouse skin, they found high amounts of Ckb coexpressed with lower
amounts of Ckmt1b, both mainly localized in suprabasal layers of the
dermis, different cell types of hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and
the subcutaneous panniculus carnosus muscle. Except for sebaceous
glands, these cells also expressed creatine transporter (CRT, or SLC6A8;
300036). Ckm and Ckmts were restricted to panniculus carnosus. Western
blot analysis showed that Ckb and Crt were upregulated about 3-fold
immediately after wounding of mouse skin, whereas the amount of Ckmt1b
increased 10 to 15 days after wounding. Healthy and psoriatic human skin
showed a similar coexpression pattern of CKB, CKMT1B, and CRT, with CRT
upregulated in psoriasis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Haas et al. (1989) determined that the CKMT1B gene contains 9 exons and
spans 5.5 kb. The 5-prime flanking region lacks CAAT and TATA motifs,
but it has a high GC content and 2 putative SP1 (189906)-binding sites.

MAPPING

By means of a clone from the human CKMT1B gene in Southern analysis of
somatic cell hybrid DNA, Stallings et al. (1988) assigned the CKMT1B
gene to chromosome 15. Steeghs et al. (1994) mapped the CKMT1B gene to
human chromosome 15q15 and to mouse chromosome 2 bands F1-F3 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Zhang et al. (2007) stated that a nearly identical copy of CKMT1B,
designated CKMT1A, is telomeric to the CKMT1B gene on chromosome 15q15.

606935	TITLE *606935 RNA-BINDING MOTIF PROTEIN 17; RBM17
;;SPLICING FACTOR, 45-KD; SPF45
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Neubauer et al. (1998) characterized the mammalian spliceosome, a
multiprotein complex that removes introns from mRNA precursors.
Approximately half of the components excised from a 2-dimensional gel
separation of the spliceosome were found in protein sequence databases.
Using nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry, the remainder were identified
and cloned using EST databases. One of the proteins characterized was a
45-kD splicing factor that the authors termed SPF45.

GENE FUNCTION

The Drosophila 'sex-lethal' (Sxl) protein promotes skipping of exon 3
from its own pre-mRNA. An unusual sequence arrangement of 2 AG
dinucleotides and an intervening polypyrimidine (Py) tract at the
3-prime end of intron 2 is important for Sxl autoregulation. Lallena et
al. (2002) showed that U2AF (see 191317) interacts with the Py tract and
downstream AG, whereas SPF45 interacts with the upstream AG and
activates it for the second catalytic step of the splicing reaction. The
authors stated that SPF45 represents a novel class of second-step
factors, and its interaction with Sxl was found to block splicing at the
second step. These results were in contrast with other mechanisms of
splicing regulation, which target early events of spliceosome assembly.
A similar role for SPF45 was demonstrated in the activation of a cryptic
3-prime splice site generated by a common mutation in the HBB gene
(141900.0364) that causes beta-thalassemia (613985).

Lim et al. (2008) demonstrated that the expanded polyglutamine tract of
ATXN1 (601556) differentially affects the function of the host protein
in the context of different endogenous protein complexes. Polyglutamine
expansion in ATXN1 favors the formation of a particular protein complex
containing RBM17 contributing to the neuropathology of SCA1 (164400) by
means of a gain-of-function mechanism. Concomitantly, polyglutamine
expansion attenuates the formation and function of another protein
complex containing ATXN1 and capicua (612082), contributing to SCA1
through a partial loss-of-function mechanism. Lim et al. (2008)
concluded that their model provides mechanistic insight into the
molecular pathogenesis of SCA1 as well as other polyglutamine diseases.

MAPPING

The RBM17 gene is located on chromosome 10p15.1, 21 kb centromeric to
the IL2RA gene (147730) in a head-to-head orientation (Lowe et al.,
2007).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In an analysis of up to 5,312 individuals with type 1 diabetes (see
601942) and 6,855 controls, Lowe et al. (2007) localized the type 1
diabetes association in the IL2RA gene region to 2 independent groups of
SNPs, spanning overlapping regions of 14 and 40 kb, encompassing IL2RA
(147730) intron 1 and the 5-prime regions of IL2RA and flanking gene
RBM17 (odds ratio = 2.04; p = 10(-28)). The authors commented that it
was unlikely that the causal variants were located within RBM17 itself,
but stated that an effect on RBM17 due to polymorphisms in the
intergenic region affecting transcription could not be ruled out.

602175	TITLE *602175 PROTEASOME SUBUNIT, BETA-TYPE, 2; PSMB2
;;PROTEASOME SUBUNIT BETA-4
DESCRIPTION The proteasome is responsible for degradation of short lived and
misfolded cytosolic and nuclear proteins in the cell. It consists of a
complex of proteins that form a 20S core particle in both prokaryotes
and eukaryotes. The 20S proteasome is composed of 7 alpha and 7 beta
subunits that dimerize to form an alpha(7)beta(7)beta(7)alpha(7)
structure. Subunits are designated alpha or beta depending on their
homology to the Thermoplasma acidophilus proteasome in which the beta
subunits are catalytically active. The 20S core complex associates with
regulatory proteins that function as proteasome activators in vivo. One
pathway of activation uses a 19S complex that is involved in the
ubiquitin (191339) pathway of protein breakdown. The PA28 complex is an
alternative proteasome activator that does not employ the use of
ubiquitin. The complex is composed of 2 homologous subunits called alpha
and beta, which form a hexameric ring. PA28 appears to be involved in
the presentation of endogenous antigens by MHC class I molecules. The
PA28 complex is expressed constitutively in antigen-presenting cells,
and its expression is upregulated by interferon gamma (147570). Many of
the genes involved in class I antigen presentation are encoded within
the MHC, including the 2 proteasome subunits PSMB9 (177045), also known
as LMP2, and PSMB8 (177046), also known as LMP7. McCusker et al. (1997)
completed the mapping of the human proteasome beta-type genes: by
fluorescence in situ hybridization they mapped the PSMB2 gene to 1p34.2,
the PSMB3 gene (602176) to 2q35, and the PSMB4 gene (602177) to 1q21.
They also showed that the genes encoding the alpha (600654) and beta
(602161) subunits of the PA28 complex are closely linked on 14q11.2,
within 1 Mb of the beta proteasome locus PSMB5 (600306). Thus, with the
exception of the genes encoding the PSMB9 and PSMB8 subunits, the beta
genes are not closely linked in the human genome. PSMB2 and PSMB4 map to
regions of chromosome 1 that are proposed to be paralogous to regions of
the human genome where other beta proteasome genes map: chromosome 6,
containing the major histocompatibility complex, and chromosome 9.

The butyrophilin (BTN) genes are a group of major histocompatibility
complex (MHC)-associated genes that encode type I membrane proteins with
2 extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and an intracellular B30.2
(PRYSPRY) domain. Three subfamilies of human BTN genes are located in
the MHC class I region: the single-copy BTN1A1 gene (601610) and the
BTN2 (e.g., BTN2A1) and BTN3 (e.g., BNT3A1; 613593) genes, which have
undergone tandem duplication, resulting in 3 copies of each (summary by
Smith et al., 2010).

CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, RT-PCR of peripheral blood leukocytes and
human cell lines, and 3-prime RACE of a fetal tissue cDNA library,
Rhodes et al. (2001) cloned BTN2A1. They also identified alternative
splicing affecting the 3-prime end of BTN2A1. Immunofluorescence
microscopy showed surface expression of BTN2A1 in transfected HeLa and
Chinese hamster ovary cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rhodes et al. (2001) determined that the BTN2A1 gene spans approximately
12 kb and contains 7 coding exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rhodes et al. (2001) mapped the BTN2A1
gene within the BTN gene cluster on chromosome 6p22.1. The BTN gene
cluster is located about 4 Mb telomeric to the classical MHC class I
genes.

615367	TITLE *615367 N-TERMINAL ASPARAGINE AMIDASE; NTAN1
;;N-TERMINAL ASPARAGINE AMIDOHYDROLASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The N-end rule relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the
identity of its N-terminal residue. By enzymatic deamidation, NTAN1
converts the tertiary destabilizing N-terminal residue asparagine to the
secondary destabilizing residue aspartate (Grigoryev et al., 1996).

CLONING

Grigoryev et al. (1996) cloned mouse Ntan1, which encodes a deduced
310-amino acid protein. By database analysis, they identified 2 splice
variants of human NTAN1. Full-length mouse and human NTAN1 share 92%
amino acid identity. Northern blot analysis detected variable expression
of an approximately 1.4-kb transcript in all 8 mouse tissues examined,
with lowest expression in testis. A transcript of about 1.1 kb was
prominently expressed in testis only.

GENE FUNCTION

By assaying yeast expressing mouse Ntan1, Grigoryev et al. (1996) found
that Ntan1 showed amidase activity toward N-terminal asparagine, but not
N-terminal glutamine, and reduced the half-life of the deamidated test
protein. Northern blot analysis showed that Ntan1 expression decreased
following differentiation in C2C12 mouse myoblasts, but not in MEL mouse
leukemia cells.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the NTAN1 gene to chromosome 16p13.11 based on an
alignment of the NTAN1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF092440) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

By interspecific backcross analysis, Grigoryev et al. (1996) mapped the
mouse Ntan1 gene to a proximal region of mouse chromosome 16 that shares
homology of synteny with human chromosome 16p.

610328	TITLE *610328 RUN AND FYVE DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; RUFY2
;;KIAA1537
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned RUFY2, which they designated
KIAA1537. RT-PCR ELISA detected variable expression in all adult and
fetal tissues examined. Highest expression was in ovary, whole adult
brain, and testis, and lowest expression was in pancreas, spleen, fetal
liver, and fetal whole brain. RUFY2 was expressed in all specific adult
brain regions examined, with highest expression in amygdala.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to RUFY1 (610327),
followed by screening prostate cancer and neuroblastoma cDNA libraries,
Yang et al. (2002) cloned RUFY2. The deduced 606-amino acid protein has
an N-terminal RUN domain, 2 central coiled-coil domains, and a
C-terminal FYVE domain containing 2 zinc-binding sites and an SH3 domain
recognition motif (PxxPxP). Northern blot analysis detected RUFY2
expression in brain, lung, and testis only.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Yang et al. (2002) demonstrated that
RUFY2 directly interacted with ETK (EPHA3; 179611) following their
coexpression in a mouse myoblast cell line.

Majercak et al. (2006) showed that expression of RUFY2 reduced secretion
of beta-amyloid from human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing APP
(104760). The RUFY2 gene maps to a region of chromosome 10q that has
been linked to both late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD6; 605526) and
elevated plasma levels of pathogenic beta-amyloid.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RUFY2
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP WI-11265). By genomic sequence analysis,
Majercak et al. (2006) mapped the RUFY2 gene to chromosome 10q21.

182860	TITLE *182860 SPECTRIN, ALPHA, ERYTHROCYTIC 1; SPTA1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Spectrin, the predominant component of the membrane skeleton of the red
cell, is essential in determining the properties of the membrane
including its shape and deformability. It consists of 2 nonidentical
subunits, alpha (MW 240,000) and beta (MW 225,000; 182870) (Knowles et
al., 1984). Spectrin is present in the red cell membrane in a tetrameric
or oligomeric form through head-to-head self-association of heterodimers
that are linked by actin (see 102560) polymers and protein 4.1 (130500)
to form a 2-dimensional network. Ankyrin (612641) binds the skeleton to
the membrane lipid bilayer through its high-affinity association with
spectrin beta chains and the integral protein band 3 (109270) of the
lipid bilayer.

CLONING

Sahr et al. (1990) isolated overlapping cDNA clones for the entire
coding sequence of human erythroid alpha spectrin. The deduced
polypeptide contains 2,429 amino acids and, as noted by Speicher and
Marchesi (1984), is composed largely of homologous 106-amino acid repeat
units. The protein can be divided into 22 segments, 17 of which are
homologous. Only the very N-terminal 22 residues and the C-terminal 150
residues appear to be unrelated to the conserved repeat units.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kotula et al. (1991) noted that the SPTA gene spans 80 kb and includes
52 exons ranging in size from 18 to 684 bp. They mapped the exons and
the intron-exon junctions. The authors speculated that the absence of
correlation between exons and the 106-amino acid repeats characteristic
of the protein reflects the evolution of a spectrin-like gene from a
minigene early in the evolution of eukaryotes.

MAPPING

Birkenmeier et al. (1988) showed that the erythroid alpha-spectrin gene
is tightly linked to the spherocytosis locus on mouse chromosome 1,
suggesting that a defect in this gene is responsible for spherocytosis
in the mouse. Raeymaekers et al. (1988) found that alpha-spectrin is
linked to Duffy blood group (FY; 110700) on chromosome 1; the lod score
was 3.81 at theta = 0.0. By somatic cell hybrid studies, Huebner et al.
(1985) assigned the alpha-spectrin gene to chromosome 1 in both mouse
and man. By in situ hybridization, the human gene was localized to
1q22-q25. Since a non-Rh-linked form of elliptocytosis had been very
tentatively mapped (maximum lod score = 2.08) to this same region by
linkage to Duffy blood group (Keats, 1979; Rao et al., 1979), the defect
in that hematologic disorder may involve alpha spectrin. (As this turned
out to be the case, this is one of the first examples of positive
results from the 'candidate gene' approach to elucidating
etiopathogenesis.) In combination with in situ hybridization data, the
findings of Middleton-Price et al. (1988) suggested that SPTA may lie
within band 1q21. The gene was found to lie proximal to the breakpoint
at 1q23 in a balanced X;1 translocation. Another cell line showed 2
alpha-spectrin alleles, consistent with the location of alpha-spectrin
in the distal part of 1q21. Pakstis et al. (1989) presented linkage data
and analyzed the relationship between the SPTA1 locus and the anonymous
DNA fragment D1S75. Pairwise analyses estimated the maximum likelihood
of 12.8% recombination for the SPTA1/D1S75 interval with a peak lod
score of 5.04. In a linkage map of chromosome 1 prepared by Rouleau et
al. (1990), it was concluded that SPTA1 lies 17 cM proximal to Fy.

GENE FUNCTION

Kotula et al. (1991) noted that peptide mapping of spectrin partial
tryptic digests allowed division of the alpha- and beta-chains into 5
and 4 domains, respectively. The alpha-I and beta-I domains, which face
each other, participate in dimer self-association. Elliptocytosis can
result from changes in either the alpha-I or beta-I domain; changes in
either can result in weakened spectrin dimer self-association.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Knowles et al. (1984) identified polymorphisms in the alpha-II domain of
spectrin in Caucasian and black individuals. The polymorphisms did not
produce anemia and did not appear to alter the expression of an
underlying spherocytosis or elliptocytosis. In family studies, the alpha
II 46,000 MW variations were consistent with mendelian inheritance.

- Elliptocytosis 2

In blacks, variants of the spectrin alpha subunit have been found:
alpha-I/74, alpha-I/46, and alpha-I/65 (Lawler et al., 1984; Lecomte et
al., 1985; Lawler et al., 1985). Alloisio et al. (1986) found the
alpha-I/65 variant in non-black persons in North Africa where a protein
4.1 defect had been found most often.

Marchesi et al. (1987) reviewed varieties of abnormal spectrins
(182860.0001-182860.0004) that have been found in hereditary
elliptocytosis (130600). All show impaired self-association to form
oligomers.

Iarocci et al. (1988) described a 4-year-old Yoruba boy in Nigeria who
at birth had severe poikilocytosis, hemolytic anemia, and
hyperbilirubinemia requiring exchange transfusion and phototherapy. The
poikilocytic anemia was found to be due to compound heterozygosity for 2
alpha-spectrin mutations. The authors indicated that 7 structural
mutations of alpha spectrin (designated I/74, I/65, I/61, I/50a, I/50b,
and I/43,42) as well as truncated alpha spectrin have been identified in
patients with hereditary elliptocytosis or hereditary pyropoikilocytosis
by SDS-PAGE evaluation of red cell membrane proteins or by analysis of
tryptic peptides following limited digestion.

One class of elliptocytogenic change is spectrin alpha(I/74) which is
characterized by an increase in the alpha-I 74-kD fragment at the
expense of the parent alpha-I 80-kD fragment. Spectrin Culoz
(182860.0006) and spectrin Lyon (182860.0007) are examples of alpha I/74
mutations of the alpha-spectrin chain.

Sahr et al. (1989) used PCR to amplify the appropriate exons in DNA from
individuals with 3 variants of hereditary elliptocytosis. In 1,
abnormality resulted from a duplication of leucine codon 148 in exon 4;
TTG-CTG to TTG-TTG-CTG (182860.0003). In 2 other unrelated cases, 2
separate single base changes were observed in exon 6: CTG to CCG
(leucine-to-proline) encoding residue 254, and TCC to CCC
(serine-to-proline) encoding residue 255. Furthermore, in 2 unrelated
individuals, a single base change of CAG to CCG (glutamine-to-proline)
encoding residue 465 in exon 11 was observed.

- Pyropoikilocytosis

Lecomte et al. (1985) described abnormality of alpha spectrin in 2 black
families with elliptocytosis and pyropoikilocytosis (266140). Marchesi
et al. (1986) also demonstrated abnormality of alpha spectrin in 2
kindreds with hereditary elliptocytosis. The clinical expression ranged
from mild elliptocytosis without hemolysis to severe poikilocytic
hemolytic anemia clinically resembling hereditary pyropoikilocytosis.

Lawler et al. (1988) described a severe form of pyropoikilocytosis in a
6-year-old black girl who was a compound heterozygote for 2 distinct
alpha-spectrin mutations, a previously detected mutation in tryptic
fragment 74 and a new mutation in tryptic fragment 61.

Lecomte et al. (1990) found a new alpha-spectrin variant in a child with
severe neonatal hemolytic anemia (182860.0021). The abnormality was
thought to be homozygous in the propositus who showed poikilocytosis. No
abnormality was detected in the parents, who came from the West Indies
and were thought to be unrelated.

- Spherocytosis Type 3

Wichterle et al. (1996) described compound heterozygosity for 2 splicing
mutations (182860.0022; 182860.0023) in the SPTA1 gene that caused
hereditary spherocytosis (270970).

Gallagher and Forget (1996) cataloged 25 alpha-spectrin mutations
reported in cases of hereditary elliptocytosis and hereditary
pyropoikilocytosis. Three were splicing mutations, 1 was a 3-bp
insertion, and the remainder were missense mutations. Gallagher and
Forget (1998) tabulated 2 SPTA1 mutations that cause hereditary
spherocytosis as contrasted with 19 mutations of the beta-spectrin gene
(SPTB; 182870) that are known to cause hereditary spherocytosis.
Gallagher and Forget (1998) tabulated 2 mutations of the SPTA gene that
caused hereditary spherocytosis.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

It has repeatedly been observed that the amount of mutant alpha chain is
variable in different individuals with hereditary elliptocytosis,
resulting in clinical pictures of variable severity. In a large Algerian
family with Sp-alpha(I/65) hereditary elliptocytosis, Guetarni et al.
(1990) demonstrated that the different levels are the result of
different percentages of the alpha-spectrin allele in trans. In an
informative sibship, they found 3 persons with a distinctly high level
of expression of the variant, suggesting the existence in trans of a
low-percentage alpha-allele (called LE allele for 'low expression'). In
contrast, a basal level of expression of the variant in the same sibship
indicated the existence in trans of a normal-percentage alpha-allele.
Haplotype analysis was also used in the study. This appears to be a
superb example of an isoallele affecting the expression of the phenotype
resulting from the other allele.

Autosomal dominant elliptocytosis within the same family may be
associated with transfusion-dependent hemolytic anemia in some
heterozygotes and vigorous good health in others. Motulsky et al. (1954)
conjectured that a second genetic defect, normally silent, might be the
explanation for this apparent exception to the principles of mendelian
genetics. Parquet et al. (1994) and Randon et al. (1994) showed that, in
fact, this was the case. The explanation lies in the effects on the
assembly of the alpha-spectrin and beta-spectrin chains when a
polymorphism exists at another point in the alpha-spectrin molecule
which also contains a mutation causing elliptocytosis. The beta chain is
synthesized at an early stage of assembly of the erythrocyte
cytoskeleton and binds to its attachment site (ankyrin) on the cell
membrane. Thereafter, the alpha chain floods the system and the part not
taken up into an equimolar complex by the beta chain is destroyed by
proteases in the cytosol (Moon and Lazarides, 1983). As demonstrated by
Speicher et al. (1992), the mechanism of the lateral association of the
constituent chains of the alpha-beta spectrin dimer involves strong
interactions between pairs of repeats at one end of the dimer. Randon et
al. (1994) found that it is one of these critical repeats that is
disturbed by the alpha-LELY mutation. Delaunay and Dhermy (1993), in
Lyon, France, had shown that there is a common, but low-expression and
symptomless spectrin polymorphism resulting from a substitution toward
the far end of the alpha chain; the mutation is designated as alpha-LELY
for 'low-expression allele, Lyon.' When freshly synthesized alpha chains
are assimilated by the beta chains already on the membrane, the normal
alpha chain is preferred to the mutant. With such a high frequency of
the alpha-LELY allele in the population, a third of heterozygotes
carrying an elliptocytosis mutation at the end of the spectrin alpha
chain will also possess an alpha-LELY allele. If both mutations occur in
the same alpha chain (that is to say in cis), which will be largely
rejected by the membrane-bound beta chain, it will be the normal alpha
chain that will be predominantly incorporated into the cytoskeletal
network. In this case, the polymorphism acts to rescue the double
heterozygote from the worst consequences of the hereditary
elliptocytosis. But if the mutations occur in different alpha-chain
alleles, then the normal beta-chain binding site will carry the
defective dimer binding sites onto the membrane, and the proportion of
functional spectrin tetramers will be greatly suppressed; the malign
effects of the elliptocytic mutation will be amplified. In some milder
forms of hereditary elliptocytosis, the mutation probably only weakens
rather than annihilates the association of spectrin dimers. Even in this
case (see Perrotta et al., 1994), an offspring with an elliptocytic
alpha-chain mutation together with alpha-LELY in trans is more
noticeably affected than the father with no alpha-LELY allele. (The
situation in which a polymorphism in the gene influences the expression
of the primary disease-producing mutation is observed also in the case
of the PRNP gene (176640): the asp178-to-asn mutation causes
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease when in cis with val129 (176640.0005), whereas
it produces familial fatal insomnia when it is in cis with met129
(176640.0010).)

Randon et al. (1994) referred to the allele in cis as alpha-HE-LELY and
the diplotype in trans as alpha-HE/alpha-LELY.

Gallagher and Forget (1993) reviewed all aspects of the alpha and beta
spectrin genes in health and disease. Delaunay and Dhermy (1993)
reviewed mutations involving the spectrin heterodimer contact site which
is critical to normal self-association of spectrin. Self-association
allows the dimer to form tetramers or higher order oligomers, and
permits the whole skeleton to acquire its mechanical properties. They
referred to pyropoikilocytosis as an 'aggravated' form of
elliptocytosis. Both are defined on morphologic grounds. Hereditary
elliptocytosis shows a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging
from the absence of symptoms to severe yet not life-threatening
pictures. Pyropoikilocytosis has a narrower spectrum of clinical
aspects, ranging from severe to life-threatening syndromes. They pointed
to the high incidence of so-called LE (for 'low expression') alleles of
the SPTA gene. The compound heterozygous state for an LE allele and an
HE allele (hereditary elliptocytosis) results in increased relative
expression of the latter, ending in a more severe clinical picture.
Remarkably, 4 different mutations have been found in codon 28 of SPTA1:
R28L (182860.0011), R28S (182860.0012), R28C (182860.0013), and R28H
(182860.0014). All 4 can result in severe pyropoikilocytosis if an LE
allele is present in trans. The fact that 4 mutations have been
demonstrated in codon 28 and that each of them has been found several
times suggests that the CpG dinucleotide is a hotspot for mutation.
Delaunay and Dhermy (1993) commented on the high frequency of the
leu148-dup mutation (182860.0003), also referred to as the alpha(I/65)
mutation, as well as the leu207-to-pro (182860.0016) and leu260-to-pro
(182860.0001) mutations. None of these reach as high a frequency as the
band 3 mutation accounting for Southern Asian ovalocytosis (109270.0002)
but are sufficiently frequent to raise the question of selective
advantage in relation to malaria. In vitro evidence supports this
possibility.

EVOLUTION

By database and phylogenetic analysis, Salomao et al. (2006) showed that
the SPTA1 gene is unique to mammals and that it arose through
duplication of the SPTAN1 gene (182810). They found that an SPTA1
fragment containing the site of head-to-head interaction with the
beta-chain bound more weakly than the corresponding SPTAN1 fragment, and
they identified sequences that determined the strength of the
dimer-dimer interaction on the membrane. Salomao et al. (2006) concluded
that SPTA1 is adapted for rapidly making and breaking tetramers, thus
contributing to the deformability of erythrocyte membranes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
SPTA1, LEU260PRO

This mutation was designated LEU254PRO by Marchesi et al. (1987) and
Sahr et al. (1989). For a time the numbering system used for SPTA1 was
based on a sequence that lacked the first 6 residues.

This substitution, which resulted from a CTG-to-CCG change in exon 6,
was found in patients with elliptocytosis (130600) by Marchesi et al.
(1987) and Sahr et al. (1989). The mutation results in a Sp-alpha I/46
variant, referring to the molecular weight of the abnormal peptide
observed after limited tryptic digestion. This variant appeared to be
restricted to the areas of the Gulf of Guinea in west Africa and to be
found in closed ethnic groups.

.0002
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
SPTA1, GLN471PRO

This mutation was designated GLN465PRO by Marchesi et al. (1987) and
Sahr et al. (1989). For a time the numbering system used for SPTA1 was
based on a sequence that lacked the first 6 residues.

This substitution, which resulted from a CAG-to-CCG change in exon 11,
was found in patients with elliptocytosis (130600) by Marchesi et al.
(1987) and Sahr et al. (1989). The mutation is a Sp-alpha I/50-46b
variant.

.0003
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
SPTA1, 3-BP INS, LEU154DUP

Marchesi et al. (1987) and Sahr et al. (1989) stated that the
duplication occurred after leu148, but it was later found to occur after
leu154. For a time the numbering system used for SPTA1 was based on a
sequence that lacked the first 6 residues.

This mutation has also been referred to as the alpha(I-65) mutation. In
2 American black patients with elliptocytosis (130600), Marchesi et al.
(1987) and Sahr et al. (1989) found insertion of an extra leucine
residue after leucine-148. Roux et al. (1989) identified the molecular
defect in 5 unrelated families in North Africa (Algeria) with the
alpha-spectrin form of hereditary elliptocytosis. This form of
elliptocytosis is associated with an abnormal 65-kD alpha-I peptide
(rather than the normal 80-kD) following limited trypsin digestion of
whole spectrin. The authors identified an extra leucine codon (TTG)
between codons 147 and 149 in exon 4, the coding sequence becoming CAG
TTG TTG CTG instead of CAG TTG CTG. The studies of Lecomte et al. (1988)
indicated a high prevalence of hereditary elliptocytosis due to this
mutation in populations of west Africa as well as in black people living
in North America.

Boulanger et al. (1992) described fast screening methods for detection
of this and the L260P mutation (182860.0001); the findings will be
useful in studying the relationship between malaria resistance and the
LEU154DUP mutation. Del Giudice et al. (1992) reported the same mutation
in 2 women from southern Italy, Campania and Sicily; however, the
associated haplotype was the same as that encountered in African and
American blacks and in North Africans. It is assumed that the mutation
was introduced from North Africa across the Sicilian channel and
ultimately originated from the Benin-Togo area. This was the same
migratory pathway followed by the Benin type hemoglobin S allele, which
is also present in southern Italy.

.0004
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
SPTA1, SER261PRO

This mutation was designated SER255PRO by Marchesi et al. (1987) and
Sahr et al. (1989). For a time the numbering system used for SPTA1 was
based on a sequence that lacked the first 6 residues.

Marchesi et al. (1987) and Sahr et al. (1989) found this substitution,
which resulted from a TCC-to-CCC change in exon 6, in patients with
elliptocytosis (130600). This mutation is a Sp-alpha I/50-46a variant.

.0005
PYROPOIKILOCYTOSIS, HEREDITARY
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2, INCLUDED
SPTA1, ARG45SER

This mutation was designated ARG39SER by Lecomte et al. (1989). For a
time the numbering system used for SPTA1 was based on a sequence that
lacked the first 6 residues.

In the family of a 36-year-old man with hereditary pyropoikilocytosis
(266140), Lecomte et al. (1989) found a typical mild hereditary
elliptocytosis (130600) in the mother, 2 brothers, a sister, and 2
nieces. The proband had severe neonatal hemolytic anemia requiring
exchange transfusions and a splenectomy at 1 year of age. Lecomte et al.
(1989) demonstrated a G-to-T transversion in codon 39 (AGT for AGG),
which changed the normal arginine to a serine in alpha-spectrin. This
mutation, designated spectrin Clichy, is a Sp-alpha I/78 variant.

.0006
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
SPTA1, GLY46VAL

This mutation was designated GLY40VAL by Morle et al. (1989, 1990). For
a time the numbering system used for SPTA1 was based on a sequence that
lacked the first 6 residues.

Morle et al. (1989, 1990) found this substitution in a French Caucasian
family with Sp-alpha I/74 hereditary elliptocytosis (130600) defined on
the basis of altered peptide maps following partial digestion of
spectrin. The alpha-174 kD fragment is increased at the expense of the
parent alpha-I 80 kD fragment. A GGT-to-GTT change in codon 40 (in exon
2) resulted in substitution of valine for glycine. This mutation was
designated spectrin Culoz.

ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
SPTA1, LEU48PHE

This mutation was designated LEU43PHE by Morle et al. (1989, 1990). For
a time the numbering system used for SPTA1 was based on a sequence that
lacked the first 6 residues.

Morle et al. (1989, 1990) found this mutation in a French Caucasian
family with Sp-alpha I/74 type of hereditary elliptocytosis (130600).
The mutation, a CTT-to-TTT change in codon 43, was demonstrated by
amplification of alpha-spectrin cDNA derived from reticulocyte mRNA.
This mutation was designated spectrin Lyon.

SPHEROCYTOSIS, TYPE 3, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
SPTA1, ALA970ASP

In the kindred with autosomal recessive spherocytosis (270970) reported
by Agre et al. (1986), Marchesi et al. (1989, 1989) identified a
CGT-to-GAT change resulting in an ala970-to-asp (A970N) substitution in
the alpha-II domain.

Boivin et al. (1993) searched for this mutation in patients with
dominant or with what the authors termed 'non-dominant' spherocytosis,
including 78 patients, 55 relatives, and 46 controls. They found that
the mutation and the HS disease gene were located on different
chromosomes and inherited independently of each other.

.0010
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
SPTA1, ARG41TRP

This mutation was designated ARG35TRP by Morle et al. (1989). For a time
the numbering system used for SPTA1 was based on a sequence that lacked
the first 6 residues.

Morle et al. (1989) described spectrin Tunis, an alpha-spectrin variant
that causes asymptomatic hereditary elliptocytosis (130600) in the
heterozygous state. The variant was found in a white North African man
and his mother. Morle et al. (1989) demonstrated that a C-to-T base
substitution converted arginine-35 (CGG) to tryptophan (TGG). This
mutation is a Sp-alpha I/78 variant.

.0011
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
SPTA1, ARG28LEU

In affected members of a kindred of Arab/Druze origin segregating
elliptocytosis (130600), Coetzer et al. (1991) identified a CGT-to-CTT
change resulting in substitution of leucine for arginine at codon 28 of
the SPTA1 gene. Coetzer et al. (1991) identified 3 other mutations in
codon 28 (see 182860.0012, 182860.0013, 182860.0014). All the probands
were heterozygous. All 4 point mutations abolished an AhaII restriction
enzyme site which allowed verification of linkage of the mutation with
elliptocytosis. The findings suggested that codon 28 is a hotspot for
mutations and also indicated that arginine-28 is critical for the
conformational stability and functional self-association of spectrin
heterodimers. All 4 arg28 mutations are Sp-alpha I/74 variants.

.0012
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
PYROPOIKILOCYTOSIS, HEREDITARY, INCLUDED
SPTA1, ARG28SER

In affected members of 2 unrelated white kindreds of English/European
origin segregating for elliptocytosis (130600), Coetzer et al. (1991)
found a CGT-to-AGT mutation leading to substitution of serine for
arginine at codon 28 of the SPTA1 gene. See 182860.0011.

Gallagher et al. (1991) found the same mutation in a patient with
hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (266140). The patient was heterozygous for
a single structural variant of spectrin and possessed a second,
uncharacterized defect, thus explaining the difference in phenotype from
that in the patients with the same defect reported by Coetzer et al.
(1991).

.0013
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
PYROPOIKILOCYTOSIS, HEREDITARY, INCLUDED
SPTA1, ARG28CYS

See 182860.0011. In affected members of 2 apparently unrelated white
kindreds from New Zealand segregating for elliptocytosis (130600),
Coetzer et al. (1991) identified a CGT-to-TGT mutation in the SPTA1 gene
that resulted in substitution of cysteine for arginine-28.

In an Italian child, Lorenzo et al. (1993) observed a de novo CGT-to-TGT
mutation at codon 28 producing severe pyropoikilocytosis (266140). The
severity of the manifestations was thought to be accounted for by the
occurrence, in trans to the alpha-28 mutation, of a polymorphism leading
to a structural abnormality of the alpha-IV/alpha-V domain junction and
with a low expression level, i.e., a so-called LE allele. The recurrent
mutation strengthens the view that codon alpha-28 is a mutational
'hotspot.'

.0014
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
PYROPOIKILOCYTOSIS, HEREDITARY, INCLUDED
SPTA1, ARG28HIS

This mutation was originally reported by Garbarz et al. (1989, 1990) as
ARG22HIS (R22H). For a time the numbering system used for SPTA1 was
based on a sequence that lacked the first 6 residues.

In affected members of the French Caucasian family originally reported
by Lecomte et al. (1987), Garbarz et al. (1989, 1990) found a CAT-to-CGT
change in codon 22 in exon 2 of the SPTA1 gene (which encodes amino
acids 3 to 82 of the alpha-I domain). In the family, 12 subjects in 4
generations had a disorder of the red cells varying from mild
elliptocytosis to hemolytic elliptocytosis (130600) to
pyropoikilocytosis (266140). In 8 of the 12 affected persons,
heterozygosity for a spectrin alpha-I/74 kD defect was demonstrated by
analysis of spectrin tryptic fragments. The defect resulted in decreased
ability of the spectrin dimers to self-associate. Clinical severity
correlated with amount of mutant spectrin and excess of spectrin dimer
in the red cell membrane.

The R28H mutation was found by Baklouti et al. (1991) in a boy with
severe elliptopoikilocytosis and in his clinically normal father. The
severe expression in the son was attributable to the existence in trans
of the alpha-V/41 polymorphism transmitted from the mother.

In an American black kindred and a black kindred from Ghana, Coetzer et
al. (1991) identified a CGT-to-CAT mutation that resulted in
substitution of histidine for arginine-28. See 182860.0011.

PYROPOIKILOCYTOSIS, HEREDITARY
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2, INCLUDED
SPTA1, LEU207PRO

In 9 individuals from 5 unrelated families with hereditary
elliptocytosis (130600) or hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (266140),
including one of the original HPP probands reported by Zarkowsky et al.
(1975), Gallagher et al. (1992) found the alpha-I/46-50a peptide after
limited tryptic digestion of spectrin. Further studies identified a
point mutation causing the replacement of a highly conserved leucine
residue by proline at position 207 in the alpha-spectrin chain, a site
51 residues to the amino-terminal side of the abnormal proteolytic
cleavage site. Dalla Venezia et al. (1993) found the leu207-to-pro
mutation in a Moroccan family in both homozygous and heterozygous
states. The mutated allele carried, in cis, the common alpha-V/41
polymorphism, which is associated with a low expression level. Dalla
Venezia et al. (1993) suggested that the cis combination of an HE
mutation and the alpha-V/41 polymorphism accounts for the low expression
of the abnormal allele in the heterozygous state.

In the original family of Zarkowsky et al. (1975), the L207P mutation
was in compound heterozygous state with an SPTA1 allele associated with
a defect in alpha-spectrin production. By analysis of reticulocyte
alpha-spectrin cDNA from 1 of the original HPP patients, Costa et al.
(2005) identified a G-to-A transition (182860.0024) at position +5 of
the donor splice site of intron 22 of the SPTA1 gene, resulting in
insertion of intronic fragments and an in-frame premature termination
codon. Following gene transfer of the IVS22+5 mutation into tissue
culture cells, there was complete absence of normally spliced SPTA1 gene
transcript.

.0017
PYROPOIKILOCYTOSIS, HEREDITARY
SPTA1, LYS48ARG

In a case of hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (266140), Gallagher et al.
(1991) found substitution of arginine for lysine at residue 48 of
alpha-spectrin. HPP is a severe hemolytic anemia characterized by
abnormal sensitivity of red blood cells to heat and erythrocyte
morphology similar to that seen in thermal burns. The genetics of HPP
usually falls into 1 of 3 categories: (1) the patients may be homozygous
for a structural variant of spectrin; (2) they may be compound
heterozygous for 2 different structural variants of spectrin; or (3)
they may be heterozygous for a single structural variant of spectrin and
possess a second, uncharacterized defect. The patient with the
lys48-to-arg mutation was of the third type. This mutation is a Sp-alpha
I/74 variant.

.0018
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
SPTA1, ASP791GLU

Alloisio et al. (1992) found an alpha-spectrin variant associated in the
heterozygous state with asymptomatic elliptocytosis (130600) and a
minimal defect in spectrin dimer self-association in a Tunisian family.
The responsible mutation was found to be a GAC-to-GAA transversion
resulting in substitution of glutamic acid for aspartic acid at codon
791. As in most alpha-spectrin variants associated with elliptocytosis,
the change altered helix 3 of the proposed triple helical model of
spectrin structure. This change was the most distant from the N terminus
of alpha-spectrin yet found in variants associated with elliptocytosis.
This mutation, designated spectrin Jendouba, is a Sp-alpha II/31
variant.

.0019
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
SPTA1, IVS17, G-A, -1

In an Algerian family, Alloisio et al. (1988) identified a new
alpha-spectrin variant, spectrin Oran, that in the homozygous state
caused severe elliptocytosis (130600). All but 2 obligate heterozygotes
were clinically normal and had normal hematologic findings; one of the
exceptions 'presented some degree of anisocytosis with rare
elliptocytes' and the other had findings consistent with heterozygosity
for a form of alpha-thalassemia affecting 10% of Algerian people. As
indicated in the report of Alloisio et al. (1993), several members of
the family who were homozygotes required transfusion, and partial
splenectomy was performed at the age of 8 months in 1 of these. Alloisio
et al. (1993) demonstrated loss of amino acids 822 to 862 (helix 2 of
repeating segment alpha-8). The ultimate genetic lesion was found to be
a G-to-A transition at intronic position -1 in the acceptor splice site
of intron 17 resulting in skipping of exon 18. The substitution also
created an acceptor splice site 1 basepair downstream, but the latter
was used only to a minor extent. This mutation is a Sp-alpha II/21
variant.

.0020
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2
PYROPOIKILOCYTOSIS, INCLUDED
SPTA1, EX5DEL, SVA RETROTRANSPOSON INS

In a 3-generation family with hereditary elliptocytosis (130600) and
pyropoikilocytosis (266140), Hassoun et al. (1994) found a truncated
alpha-spectrin protein. They showed, furthermore, that the SPTA1 gene
had been disrupted by a mobile element resulting in exon skipping. The
element caused duplication of the insertion site and was terminated by a
long poly(A) tail downstream of multiple consensus polyadenylation
signals. Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA, using this element
as probe, revealed 1 to 3 copies per individual. The element had no
homology to any previously reported sequence and therefore appeared to
be a member of a novel family of mobile elements. This mutation is a
Sp-alpha I/50-46a variant.

Ostertag et al. (2003) showed that the sequence change observed by
Hassoun et al. (1994) was the result of an SVA-mediated transduction
event. (Shen et al. (1994) used the term 'SVA' (SINE-R, VNTR, and alu)
to describe such a 'composite retroposon.') Ostertag et al. (2003)
showed that the de novo insertion into the alpha-spectrin gene was
caused by an SVA-mediated transduction.

PYROPOIKILOCYTOSIS, HEREDITARY
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 2, INCLUDED
SPTA1, IVS19, T-G, -13

Lecomte et al. (1990) reported the case of a patient with severe
poikilocytic anemia, the child of apparently unrelated parents, both
from Guadeloupe in the French West Indies. The baby had severe hemolytic
anemia requiring frequent blood transfusions. Partial splenectomy was
performed at age 3, but complete splenectomy was necessary 2 years
later. Thereafter the propositus experienced a compensated hemolysis.
Blood smears showed marked poikilocytosis with spherocytes,
microspherocytes, and a few elliptocytes as observed in hereditary
pyropoikilocytosis (266140). In the patient reported by Lecomte et al.
(1990), Fournier et al. (1997) identified a splicing mutation of the
SPTA1 gene: a T-to-G transversion at nucleotide position -13 upstream of
the 3-prime acceptor splice site of exon 20. This polypyrimidine tract
mutation created a new acceptor site, AT-to-AG, and led to the
production of 2 novel mRNAs. One mRNA contained a 12-nucleotide intronic
insertion upstream of exon 20. This insertion introduced a termination
codon into the reading frame and was predicted to encode a truncated
protein that lacked the nucleation site and thus could not be assembled
in the membrane. In the other mRNA, there was in-frame skipping of exon
20, predicting a truncated alpha-spectrin chain. The homozygous
propositus had only truncated (277 kD) alpha-spectrin chains in his
erythrocyte membranes. His heterozygous parents were clinically and
biochemically normal. This allele was identified in 3% of asymptomatic
individuals from Benin, Africa, when a new MwoI restriction site was
used for identification of heterozygosity. This mutation, designated
spectrin St Claude, is a Sp-alpha II/47 variant.

Burke et al. (1998) found the same mutation in the SPTA1 gene in a South
African hereditary elliptocytosis (130600) family and referred to it as
spectrin Johannesburg. The kindred was of Afrikaner origin. Although the
parents were apparently unrelated, the probands were homozygous. Partial
spectrin deficiency in the proband's erythrocyte membranes resulted from
the spectrin-ankyrin binding defect and destabilized the lipid bilayer,
causing spherocytes. The reduced membrane spectrin content in concert
with the milder dimer self-association defect further weakened the
membrane skeleton and allowed deformation of the erythrocytes into
elliptocytes and poikilocytes. The observations illustrated how a single
point mutation in the alpha-spectrin gene impairs functions of both the
alpha- and the beta-spectrin proteins, resulting in qualitative and
quantitative membrane abnormalities.

.0022
SPHEROCYTOSIS, TYPE 3, DUE TO SPECTRIN PRAGUE
SPTA1, IVS36, A-G, -1

Wichterle et al. (1996) studied a patient with severe spherocytic
hemolytic anemia (270970) without a family history of spherocytosis.
Analysis of the patient's erythrocyte membrane proteins revealed
spectrin deficiency and a truncated alpha-spectrin protein. They
determined that the patient was a compound heterozygote with 2 mutations
in the alpha-spectrin gene. The mutation in the paternal allele,
designated alpha-spectrin-Prague, was an A-to-G transition in the
penultimate position of intron 36 that led to skipping of exon 37,
frameshift, and production of the truncated alpha-spectrin protein. The
maternal allele, designated alpha-spectrin-Lepra, contained a C-to-T
transition at position -99 of intron 30 (182860.0023). This mutation
enhanced an alternative acceptor splice site 70 nucleotides upstream
from the regular site. The alternative splicing caused a frameshift and
premature termination of translation leading to a significant decrease
in alpha-spectrin production. The spectrin-Lepra mutation was linked to
a spectrin alpha-IIa marker that was found to be associated with
recessive or nondominant spectrin-deficient hereditary spherocytosis in
approximately 50% of studied families. Wichterle et al. (1996) concluded
that the spectrin-Lepra mutation combined in trans with the alpha-Prague
mutation was responsible for the severe hemolytic anemia in the proband.
They suggested, furthermore, that the spectrin-Lepra allele may
frequently be involved in the pathogenesis of recessive or nondominant
spectrin-deficient hereditary spherocytosis.

615110	TITLE *615110 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 53; WDR53
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

WDR53 is predicted to be an adaptor protein that regulates the
interactions of other proteins with the CUL4 (see 603137)-DDB1 (600045)
ubiquitin E3 ligase complex (Higa et al., 2006).

CLONING

By mass spectrometric analysis of proteins that interacted with the
CUL4-DDB1 complex in human cell lines, Higa et al. (2006) identified
WDR53. The deduced protein is predicted to have a large central WD40
repeat domain and short N- and C-terminal tails.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the WDR53 gene to chromosome 3q29 based on an
alignment of the WDR53 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC054030) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

603502	TITLE *603502 INTERFERON-RELATED DEVELOPMENTAL REGULATOR 1; IFRD1
;;TETRADECANOYL PHORBOL ACETATE-INDUCED SEQUENCE 7; TIS7;;
TPA-INDUCED SEQUENCE 7;;
PC4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential screening for cDNAs upregulated during nerve growth
factor (NGF; 162030)-induced neural differentiation in rat PC12 cells,
Tirone and Shooter (1989) cloned Pc4. The deduced protein contains 3
highly hydrophobic regions. Northern blot analysis of adult rat tissues
detected expression in skeletal muscle, heart, and spleen, but not in
kidney, liver, and brain. In day-13.5 rat embryonic tissues, expression
was detected in brain, placenta, and amnion.

The rat Pc4 gene, initially isolated as a nerve growth factor-inducible
sequence in PC12 cells, is necessary for muscle differentiation and may
have a role in signal transduction. By searching EST databases with a
rat Pc4 cDNA, Buanne et al. (1998) isolated ESTs encoding IFDR1, a human
homolog of rat Pc4. The deduced 453-amino acid human IFRD1 protein is
90% identical to both rat and mouse Ifrd1 (Pc4), and 47.6% identical to
human SKMc15 (IFRD2; 602725). The C terminus of IFRD1 shows 47.5%
similarity to the entire human interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570) protein.
IFRD1 has a calculated molecular mass of 50,685 Da. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.2-kb IFRD1 transcript in several human tissues,
although at different levels of expression. At midgestation during mouse
development, Ifrd1 was expressed primarily in specific differentiating
structures and body organs.

GENE FUNCTION

By RT-PCR-based differential display, Vietor et al. (2002) identified
Tis7 as a gene upregulated upon Jun (165160)-induced loss of polarity in
a mouse mammary epithelial cell line. In unpolarized cells, the level of
Tis7 protein was elevated and Tis7 translocated into the nucleus. cDNA
microarray analysis revealed that overexpression of Tis7 repressed
several genes. By yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses,
Vietor et al. (2002) determined that Tis7 interacts with several
proteins of the SIN3 complex, including Sin3b (607777), Hdac1 (601241),
Ncor (600849), and Sap30 (603378). The coprecipitated complex was
enzymatically active and repressed transcription of a reporter gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Brkanac et al. (2009) stated that the IFRD1 gene comprises 12 exons.

MAPPING

Based on STSs, Buanne et al. (1998) tentatively mapped the IFRD1 gene to
7q22-q31.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

To identify genetic modifiers of lung disease severity in cystic
fibrosis (219700), Gu et al. (2009) performed a genomewide
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) scan in 1 cohort of cystic fibrosis
patients, replicating top candidates in an independent cohort. This
approach identified IFRD1 as a modifier of cystic fibrosis lung disease
severity. IFRD1 is a histone deacetylase-dependent transcriptional
coregulator expressed during terminal neutrophil differentiation.
Neutrophils, but not macrophages, from Ifrd1-null mice showed blunted
effector function, associated with decreased NF-kappa-B p65 (RELA;
164014) transactivation. In vivo, IFRD1 deficiency caused delayed
bacterial clearance from the airway, but also less inflammation and
disease--a phenotype primarily dependent on hematopoietic cell
expression, or lack of expression, of IFRD1. In humans, IFRD1
polymorphisms were significantly associated with variation in neutrophil
effector function. The IFRD SNP dbSNP rs7817 showed significant
association with both cross-sectional or longitudinal measures of lung
function with a P value of less than 0.05 after Bonferroni correction.
Notably, both family-based association and quantitative transmission
disequilibrium tests showed that the heterozygote genotype CT was
associated with lower lung function than either homozygote CC or TT.

Brkanac et al. (2009) identified a missense mutation in the IFRD1 gene,
a A-to-G transition at nucleotide 743 that resulting in an ile-to-val
substitution at codon 172 (I172V), that segregated absolutely with the
SMNA (607458) phenotype in a 6-generation American family of Irish
descent. Isoleucine-172 is highly conserved across species, but valine
at this position is present in elephant, chicken, Xenopus tropicalis,
and zebrafish. Brkanac et al. (2009) suggested that this change might
affect protein structure. However, they concluded that mutation analysis
of IFRD1 in additional patients with similar phenotypes was needed for
demonstration of causality and further evaluation of the importance of
IRFD1 in neurologic diseases.

ANIMAL MODEL

Vadivelu et al. (2004) found that Tis7 knockout mice were fertile and
showed no gross histologic abnormalities. However, Tis7 disruption
delayed skeletal muscle regeneration and altered skeletal muscle
isometric contractile properties after muscle crush damage, and it
downregulated expression of several muscle-specific genes. Cultured
primary myogenic satellite cells from Tis7 -/- mice showed reduced
differentiation potential and fusion index. Vadivelu et al. (2004)
concluded that TIS7 plays a regulatory role during adult muscle
regeneration.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cubilin is the intestinal receptor for the endocytosis of intrinsic
factor (IF; 609342)-vitamin B12 and a receptor in epithelial apoA-I/HDL
(see 107680) metabolism (summary by Kozyraki et al., 1998).

CLONING

By surface plasmon resonance analysis of ligand-affinity-purified human
cubilin, Kozyraki et al. (1998) demonstrated a high affinity calcium-
and cobalamin (vitamin B12)-dependent binding of gastric intrinsic
factor (IF)-cobalamin. Complete cDNA cloning of the human receptor
showed a 3,598-amino acid peripheral membrane protein with 69% identity
to rat cubilin. Amino-terminal sequencing of the receptor indicated that
the cDNA sequence encodes a precursor protein undergoing proteolytic
processing due to cleavage at a recognition site
(arg-7/glu-8/lys-9/arg-10) for the trans-Golgi proteinase furin
(136950).

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, radiation hybrid mapping, and
screening of YAC clones, Kozyraki et al. (1998) mapped the human cubilin
gene between markers D10S1661 and WI-5445 on the short arm of chromosome
10. This was within the 6-cM region harboring the gene responsible for
megaloblastic anemia-1 (MGA1; 261100). All of this was considered
circumstantial evidence that an impaired synthesis, processing, or
ligand binding of cubilin is the molecular basis of Imerslund-Grasbeck
disease (MGA1).

GENE FUNCTION

Studies in rodents showed that uptake of cobalamin in complex with IF is
facilitated by an intestinal 460-kD protein (Birn et al., 1997;
Seetharam et al., 1997), designated cubilin (Moestrup et al., 1998).
Cubilin is suggested to traffic by means of megalin (LRP2; 600073), a
600-kD endocytic receptor expressed in the same tissues and mediating
uptake of a number of ligands, including transcobalamin-cobalamin
complexes. Like megalin, cubilin has a significantly higher expression
in the renal proximal tubules compared with the intestine, and, because
IF is only present in minute amounts in nongastrointestinal tissues,
cubilin might also have multiligand properties. Cubilin binds
receptor-associated protein (RAP; 104225), a 40-kD endoplasmic reticulum
protein also binding with high affinity to the multiligand giant
receptors (e.g., megalin) belonging to the low density lipoprotein
receptor (LDLR; 606945) protein family. RAP may function as a chaperone
during folding of the receptors. Moestrup et al. (1998) determined the
primary structure of rat cubilin and showed that almost the entire
sequence is accounted for by a cluster of 8 epidermal growth factor
(EGF) repeats, followed by a large cluster of 27 CUB domains which led
to the designation of the receptor. (The name CUB, introduced by Bork
and Beckmann (1993), is an abbreviation for complement subcomponents
C1r/C1s (613785; 120580), Uegf, and bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP1;
112264).)

Although cubilin is the intestinal receptor for the endocytosis of
intrinsic factor-vitamin B12, several lines of evidence, including a
high expression in kidney and yolk sac, indicated that it may have
additional functions. Using cubilin affinity chromatography, Kozyraki et
al. (1999) isolated apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1; 107680), the main protein
of high density lipoprotein (HDL). They demonstrated a high-affinity
binding of APOA1 and HDL to cubilin, and cubilin-expressing yolk sac
cells showed efficient endocytosis of iodine-labeled HDL that could be
inhibited by IgG antibodies against APOA1 and cubilin. The physiologic
relevance of the cubilin-APOA1 interaction was further emphasized by
urinary APOA1 loss in some known cases of functional cubilin deficiency
(Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome). Therefore, cubilin is a receptor in
epithelial APOA1/HDL metabolism.

Megalin binds a large number of structurally unrelated ligands, and
coreceptors may confer ligand specificity by sequestering and presenting
their cargo to megalin. For example, IF-B12 complex is taken up in the
intestine by a tandem receptor-mediated mechanism; the complex is first
bound to a receptor, cubilin, anchored to the outer leaflet of the
plasma membrane possibly by an amphipathic helix, followed by
endocytosis of cubilin and its cargo mediated by megalin. The pivotal
role of intestinal cubilin is underscored by the vitamin B12 deficiency
observed in patients with Imerslund-Grasbeck disease characterized by
defective cubilin incapable of binding IF-B12. These patients have low
molecular weight proteinuria in addition to megaloblastic anemia,
indicating dysfunction of cubilin coexpressed with megalin in kidney
proximal tubules (summary by Nykjaer et al., 2001).

Nykjaer et al. (2001) identified cubilin as an important coreceptor in
the endocytic pathway for retrieval of 25(OH)D3-DBP complexes by
megalin-mediated endocytosis in the kidney. They showed that absence of
cubilin or inhibition of its function markedly reduces cellular uptake
of the steroid-carrier complex, and animals or patients lacking
functional cubilin are characterized by abnormal vitamin D metabolism.
They identified patients with mutations in an endocytic pathway that
regulates steroid hormone metabolism.

Cubilin recognizes intrinsic factor (IF)-cobalamin and various other
proteins to be endocytosed in the intestine and kidney, respectively.
Fyfe et al. (2004) showed that cubilin and amnionless (AMN; 605799)
colocalize in the endocytic apparatus of polarized epithelial cells and
copurify as a tight complex during IF-cobalamin affinity and
nondenaturing gel filtration chromatography. In transfected cells
expressing either AMN or a truncated IF-cobalamin-binding cubilin
construct, neither protein alone conferred ligand endocytosis. Other
studies indicated that cubilin and AMN are subunits of a novel
cubilin/AMN (cubam) complex, where AMN binds to the N-terminal third of
cubilin and directs subcellular localization and endocytosis of cubilin
with its ligand. Fyfe et al. (2004) concluded that mutations affecting
either of the 2 proteins may abrogate function of the cubam complex and
cause Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Andersen et al. (2010) presented the crystal structure of the complex
between gastric intrinsic factor (IF; 609342)-cobalamin and the
CUBN-IF-cobalamin-binding region determined at 3.3-angstrom resolution.
The structure provided insight into how several CUB (complement C1r/C1s,
Uegf, Bmp1) domains collectively function as modular ligand-binding
regions, and how 2 distant CUB domains embrace the cobalamin molecule by
binding the 2 IF domains in a calcium-dependent manner. This dual-point
model provided a probable explanation of how cobalamin indirectly
induces ligand-receptor coupling. Finally, the comparison of
calcium-binding CUB domains and the LDLR-type A modules suggested that
the electrostatic pairing of a basic ligand arginine/lysine residue with
calcium-coordinating acidic aspartates/glutamates is a common theme of
calcium-dependent ligand-receptor interactions.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Megaloblastic anemia-1 (MGA1; 261100) is a rare, autosomal recessive
disorder characterized by juvenile megaloblastic anemia, as well as
neurologic symptoms that may be the only manifestations. At the cellular
level, MGA1 is characterized by selective intestinal B12 malabsorption.
MGA1 occurs worldwide, but its prevalence is higher in several Middle
Eastern countries and in Norway, and highest in Finland (0.8 in
100,000). Aminoff et al. (1995) mapped the MGA1 locus by linkage
analysis in Finnish and Norwegian families to a 6-cM region on 10p12.1.
As the receptor for intrinsic factor-B12 complex (IF-B12), the CUBN gene
was a logical candidate for the site of the mutation and was also a
positional candidate because it maps to the same region. Aminoff et al.
(1999) refined the MGA1 region by linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping,
fine-mapped the CUBN gene in 17 Finnish MGA1 families, and identified 2
independent disease-specific CUBN mutations.

Nykjaer et al. (2001) found that a patient with megaloblastic anemia-1
who was homozygous for the intronic single-nucleotide substitution
causing the activation of a cryptic splice site and leading to an
insertion into domain 6 of the CUBN (602997.0002) gene showed urinary
loss of DBP and 25(OH)D3. On the other hand, patients with the missense
mutation P1297L (602997.0001) reabsorbed DBP normally, suggesting that
the binding site for 25(OH)D3-DBP is distinct from the binding site for
IF-B12.

In a patient with megalobastic anemia-1, Finnish type, Storm et al.
(2011) identified homozygosity for a splice site mutation in the CUBN
gene (602997.0003). This patient showed no immunogenic reaction to
cubilin and was found to have an abnormal cytoplasmic, vesicular
distribution of amnionless, its receptor partner, in renal biopsy
specimen, indicating that amnionless depends on cubilin for correct
localization in the human proximal tubule.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mixed breed dogs exhibiting autosomal recessive inheritance of cubilin
malexpression have been reported (Fyfe et al., 1991; Xu et al., 1999).
In these dogs, Nykjaer et al. (2001) showed that there is a disturbance
of vitamin D metabolism as well as severe vitamin B12 deficiency similar
to that of patients with Imerslund-Grasbeck disease.

HISTORY

Megaloblastic anemia and neurologic disturbances are common symptoms of
deficiency of the coenzyme vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin). The cellular
uptake of the vitamin and its modified forms depends on the binding to
the carrier proteins, intrinsic factor (IF; 609342) produced in the
stomach, and transcobalamin, present in the circulation and various
tissue fluids. Hereditary forms of cobalamin deficiency are known to
relate to qualitatively abnormal IF (see 261000), to decreased synthesis
of transcobalamin (275350), and to a defect of the intestinal epithelium
leading to decreased uptake of IF-cobalamin and failure to absorb
cobalamin (Imerslund-Grasbeck disease (IGS), or megaloblastic anemia-1
(MGA1); 261100). Imerslund-Grasbeck disease has been shown by linkage
studies to be caused by mutation in a region designated MGA1
(megaloblastic anemia-1), located on 10p between markers D10S548 and
D10S466. The defect has been thought to be related to abnormal
epithelial translocation of cobalamin, perhaps due to decreased receptor
function/expression.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA 1, FINNISH TYPE
CUBN, PRO1297LEU

In 16 of 17 Finnish families segregating megaloblastic anemia-1
(261100), Aminoff et al. (1999) found that 31 of 34 disease chromosomes
carried a 3916C-T transition in the CUBN gene, resulting in a
pro1297-to-leu amino acid substitution in cubilin. The mutation was
found in only 1 of 316 control Finnish chromosomes. All parents were
heterozygous.

By site-directed mutagenesis, mammalian expression, and functional
comparison of the purified wildtype and Finnish mutant forms of the
IF-cobalamin-binding region of cubilin (amino acids 928-1386),
Kristiansen et al. (2000) investigated the functional implications of
the P1297L mutation. They found that the mutation impairs recognition of
intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex by cubilin.

.0002
MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA 1, FINNISH TYPE
CUBN, IVS6, C-G

Aminoff et al. (1999) found that in 1 Finnish family with MGA1 (261100),
the proband was homozygous for an intronic mutation which was found in
none of the 302 control Finnish chromosomes. An apparent in-frame
insertion had occurred due to a point mutation in the intron
interrupting domain 6 of the CUBN gene. The change was a C-to-G
transversion.

.0003
MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA 1, FINNISH TYPE
CUBN, IVS23, G-T, +1

Storm et al. (2011) identified a patient with Imerslund-Grasbeck
syndrome (261100) with a novel homozygous G-to-T transversion at the
conserved donor splice site of exon 23 of the CUBN gene. A renal biopsy
specimen from the patient showed no immunologic reaction for cubilin and
an abnormal cytoplasmic, vesicular distribution of amnionless (605799),
indicating that amnionless depends on cubilin for correct localization
in the human proximal tubule.

601580	TITLE *601580 CAPPING PROTEIN, ALPHA-1; CAPZA1
;;CAP PROTEIN, ACTIN, ALPHA-1 SUBUNIT; CAPPA1
DESCRIPTION Barron-Casella et al. (1995) stated that CapZ was identified in chicken
as a nonsevering, barbed-end actin-binding protein composed of alpha and
beta subunits. In the chicken, 2 cDNAs were isolated for the alpha
subunit. The alpha-1 and alpha-2 (CAPZA2; 601571) isoforms, which share
85% identity, are the products of 2 separate genes; 1 gene appears to be
responsible for beta-subunit expression (see CAPZB; 601572). By capping
the barbed end of actin filaments, CapZ regulates the growth of the
actin filament at the barbed end.

Cooper (1999) noted that the STS stSG3463 (GenBank GENBANK G43425),
which has been mapped to chromosome 1, shares sequence identity with the
corresponding region of a CAPZA1 cDNA.

Hart et al. (1997) cloned 3 mouse homologs of CAPZA1, 2 of which are
pseudogenes. They mapped the functional mouse Capza1 gene to chromosome
3 by interspecific backcross analysis.

614539	TITLE *614539 HELICASE, DNA, B; HELB
;;DNA HELICASE B;;
HDHB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNA replication, repair, recombination, and transcription require
unwinding of the DNA double-helical structure. DNA helicases, such as
HELB, are DNA-dependent ATPases that catalyze DNA unwinding (Tada et
al., 2001).

CLONING

Tada et al. (2001) cloned mouse Helb. The deduced 1,074-amino acid
protein has 7 conserved helicase motifs and a calculated molecular mass
of 121.5 kD. Helb had an apparent molecular mass of 130 kD by SDS-PAGE.

Using mouse Helb to search an EST database, followed by RT-PCR of HeLa
and HEK293 cell RNA, Taneja et al. (2002) cloned human HELB, which they
called HDHB. The deduced 1,087-amino acid protein has 7 helicase motifs,
including Walker A and Walker B motifs, characteristic of superfamily-1
helicases. It contains 9 potential phosphorylation sites. RT-PCR
analysis detected HELB expression in all tissues examined, with highest
levels in testis and thymus. Expression was also detected in several
human cell lines and in human foreskin fibroblasts. Western blot
analysis of transfected insect cells detected HELB at an apparent
molecular mass of 180 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Tada et al. (2001) identified a point mutation in Helb in
temperature-sensitive mutant cells derived from a mouse mammary
carcinoma cell line that exhibited reduced cell growth and DNA-dependent
ATPase activity when incubated at the nonpermissive temperature, 39
degree C. Growth arrest in mutant cells occurred at early S phase at the
nonpermissive temperature, suggesting that Helb functions in the early
stage of S phase.

Using recombinant protein expressed in insect cells, Taneja et al.
(2002) found that HDHB had robust ATPase activity in the presence of
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or a DNA fork-like substrate with
single-stranded 5-prime and 3-prime tails. It had little to no activity
against duplex DNA or RNA. Both ATP and deoxyATP, but not other ribo- or
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, supported HDHB unwinding activity
against the fork structure. Helicase activity was detected with either
Mg(2+) or Mn(2+), but not with other divalent cations. HDHB showed
5-prime to 3-prime polarity of unwinding. HDHB stimulated synthesis of
RNA primers from M13 ssDNA by human DNA polymerase alpha-primase (see
176635) in the presence of RPA (RPA1; 179835). Inactivating mutations
within the Walker A or Walker B motifs of HDHB did not abrogate
coprecipitation of HDHB with the polymerase alpha-primase subunits p180
(POLA1; 312040) or p68 (POLA2). However, mutations within the Walker A
or Walker B motifs resulted in a dominant-negative HDHB protein that
interfered with wildtype HDHB and inhibited G1/S transition when
injected into HeLa cells in early G1.

Guler et al. (2012) found that chemical- or ultraviolet
irradiation-induced DNA damage caused recruitment of soluble nuclear
HDHB to chromatin in several human cell lines, predominantly during S
phase. Silencing of RPA70 (RPA1) reduced accumulation of HDHB on
chromatin. Mutation analysis and protein interaction assays revealed
that a basic cleft of the N-terminal oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide
binding-fold domain of RPA70 interacted with highly conserved acidic
residues C-terminal to the Walker A motif of HDHB. Knockdown of HDHB
increased replication stress caused by hydroxyurea exposure and
sensitized cells to camptothecin-induced DNA damage. Guler et al. (2012)
hypothesized that RPA70 recruits HDHB to sites of DNA damage and that
HDHB has a role in recovery from replication stress.

GENE STRUCTURE

Taneja et al. (2002) stated that the HELB gene contains over 13 exons.

MAPPING

Taneja et al. (2002) stated that the HELB gene maps to chromosome 12q13.

SMOOTH MUSCLE ACTIN;;
ACTIN, ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Because actin is a highly conserved protein, Engel et al. (1981) could
use cloned actin genes from Drosophila and from chicken to isolate 12
actin gene fragments from a human DNA library. Restriction endonuclease
studies of each indicated that they are not allelic and are from
nonoverlapping regions of the genome. In all, 25 to 30 EcoRI fragments
homologous to actin genes were found in the human genome and no
restriction site polymorphism was found indicating evolutionary
conservatism.

Humphries et al. (1981) used probes from the mouse to detect actin genes
in human DNA and concluded that there are about 20 actin genes in the
human genome. Three lines of evidence supported this number: the rate of
hybridization of the mouse probe with human DNA; the fact that the probe
hybridizes to 17-20 bands in Southern blots of restriction enzyme
digests of total human DNA; restriction enzyme mapping of individual
human actin genes indicating at least 9 different genes, judged on
probability grounds to have been picked from a pool of at least 20.

Hamada et al. (1982) isolated and characterized the human cardiac actin
gene. The cardiac and skeletal actin genes showed close similarity,
suggesting a relatively recent derivation from a common ancestral gene.
Nucleotide sequences of all exon/intron boundaries agreed with the GT/AG
rule (GT at the 5-prime and AG at the 3-prime termini of each intron).
Gunning et al. (1984) noted that the cardiac actin gene and the skeletal
actin gene (102610) on chromosome 1 are coexpressed in both skeletal and
heart muscle.

MAPPING

Using a cDNA fragment from an exon of the human cardiac actin gene in
somatic hybrid cell studies, Shows et al. (1984) showed that the gene is
coded by the segment 15q11-qter. Crosby et al. (1989) showed that in the
mouse the cardiac actin gene (Actc-1) is not on chromosome 17 as
previously reported (Czosnek et al., 1983) but is located on chromosome
2. It is closely linked to beta-2-microglobulin as indicated by mapping
studies using restriction fragment variants in recombinant inbred
strains. Using a highly polymorphic CA repeat microsatellite within
intron 4 of the ACTC gene, Kramer et al. (1992) did family linkage
studies with multiple markers on 15q, thus permitting the gene to be
placed on the chromosome linkage map. They demonstrated that it lies
about 0.06 cM proximal to D15S49, which is about 0.05 cM proximal to
D15S25, which in turn is about 0.07 cM proximal to D15S1; D15S1 is
tightly linked to the Marfan syndrome and to fibrillin. Thus ACTC may be
about 0.18 cM proximal to the fibrillin locus and no more distal than
15q21.1.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ueyama et al. (1995) assigned the
ACTC1 gene to chromosome 15q14.

GENE FUNCTION

Actin has been identified in many kinds of cells including muscle, where
it is a major constituent of the thin filament, and platelets. Muscle
actins from sources as diverse as rabbits and fish are very similar in
amino acid sequence. Elzinga et al. (1976) examined whether actin in
different tissues of the same organism are products of the same gene.
They found that human platelet and human cardiac actins differ by one
amino acid, viz., threonine and valine, respectively, at position 129.
Thus they must be determined by different genes. Actins can be separated
by isoelectric focusing into 3 main groups which show more than 90%
homology of amino acid sequence. Firtel (1981) referred to the actin of
smooth muscle, the most acidic form, as alpha type and the 2 cytoplasmic
forms as beta and gamma. Beta and gamma actins are involved in the
cytoskeleton and in internal cell mobility phenomena.

The actins constitute multiple gene families. There is only a 4% amino
acid difference in the actins of Physarum and mammals. In mammals, 4
different muscle actins have been sequenced: from fast muscle, heart,
aorta, and stomach. These vary only by 4 to 6 amino acids from each
other, and by about 25 amino acids from the beta and gamma actins. Thus,
from the protein data, at least 6 actin genes would be expected in
mammals. Recombinant DNA probes for both actin and myosin of the mouse
have been made (Weydert et al., 1981).

Buckingham et al. (1986) provided a summary of the actin and myosin
multigene families in mouse and man. Certain inbred mouse lines, e.g.,
BALB/c, have a mutant cardiac actin locus (Garner et al., 1986). The
first 3 coding exons and promoter region of the gene are present as a
duplication immediately upstream from the cardiac actin gene. The
upstream promoter is active, and partial gene transcripts are generated
which are correctly spliced for the first 3 coding exons but which
terminate at cryptic sites in the region between the duplication and the
gene. Transcriptional activity at the upstream promoter interferes with
the downstream promoter of the bona fide cardiac actin gene, leading to
a 5- to 6-fold reduction in cardiac actin mRNA in the hearts of BALB/c
mice. In this situation there is an accumulation of skeletal actin gene
transcripts in the adult hearts of these mice, which partially
compensates for the reduction in cardiac actin transcripts. BALB/c mice
have a normal life span and their hearts do not undergo hypertrophy.
Apparently, cardiac and skeletal actins, which differ only by 4 out of
375 amino acids, are to some extent interchangeable. Schwartz et al.
(1986) found that under conditions of aortic stenosis leading to cardiac
overload and cardiac hypertrophy, skeletal actin gene transcripts are
found in adult rodent hearts in addition to the cardiac actin gene
products normally present.

Matsson et al. (2008) performed morpholino knockdown of the Actc1 gene
in chick embryos and found significant association with delayed looping
and reduced atrial septa, supporting a developmental role for the
protein.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Litt and Luty (1989) used PCR to amplify a microsatellite hypervariable
repeat in the human cardiac actin gene. They detected 12 different
allelic fragments in 37 unrelated individuals, of whom 32 were
heterozygous.

(Weber and May (1989) also found that (GT)n repeats within human loci
are highly polymorphic.) In vertebrates, 6 actin isoforms are known: 4
muscle types (skeletal, cardiac, and 2 smooth muscle types) and 2
nonmuscle types (cytoplasmic actins).

- Dilated Cardiomyopathy 1R

To test the hypothesis that actin dysfunction leads to heart failure,
Olson et al. (1998) examined patients with hereditary idiopathic dilated
cardiomyopathy (see 115200) for mutations in the cardiac ACTC gene.
Missense mutations in ACTC (102540.0001 and 102540.0002) that
cosegregated with a form of dilated cardiomyopathy, here designated
CMD1R (613424), were identified in 2 unrelated families, respectively.
Both mutations affected universally conserved amino acids in domains of
actin that attached to Z bands and intercalated discs. Coupled with
previous data showing that dystrophin mutations also cause dilated
cardiomyopathy, these results raised the possibility that defective
transmission of force in cardiac myocytes is a mechanism underlying
heart failure.

To determine how frequently mutations in the ACTC gene are responsible
for dilated cardiomyopathy, Takai et al. (1999) studied 136 Japanese
cases of this disorder. Although several polymorphisms were found, no
disease-causing changes were identified, leading Takai et al. (1999) to
conclude that mutation in the ACTC gene is a rare cause of dilated
cardiomyopathy, at least in Japanese patients.

Mayosi et al. (1999) studied 57 South African patients with dilated
cardiomyopathy, 56% of whom were of black African origin. No mutation
predicted to produce an alteration in protein was identified in either
the skeletal or cardiac actin genes in any patient.

- Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy 11

In a large 3-generation family with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH11;
612098), Mogensen et al. (1999) identified heterozygosity for a missense
mutation in the ACTC1 gene (A295S; 102540.0003) that was located near 2
missense mutations previously identified as causing an inherited form of
dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1R). The authors stated that ACTC1 was the
first sarcomeric gene described in which mutations are responsible for 2
different cardiomyopathies, and hypothesized that ACTC1 mutations
affecting sarcomere contraction lead to HCM and that mutations affecting
force transmission from the sarcomere to the surrounding syncytium lead
to dilated cardiomyopathy.

Olson et al. (2000) screened the ACTC1 gene in 368 unrelated patients
with sporadic or familial CMH and identified 3 different heterozygous
mutations in 2 sporadic patients with apical CMH (102540.0007 and
102540.0008, respectively) and in a 4-generation family segregating
autosomal dominant CMH (E101K; 102540.0009). None of the mutations was
detected in 150 unrelated controls, and each involved a highly conserved
residue in ACTC1. The authors noted that these and previously identified
CMH-related ACTC1 mutations are likely to affect actin-myosin
interaction and force generation; in contrast, CMD-related ACTC1
mutations (e.g., R312H and E361G) are not located in domains interacting
with the myosin head, but rather occur in a region of the actin monomer
that forms the immobilized end of the actin filament. Olson et al.
(2000) concluded that mutations in ACTC1 can cause either CMH or CMD,
depending on the functional domain of actin that is affected.

In affected members of 2 families segregating autosomal dominant apical
CMH over 3 generations, Arad et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for
the E101K mutation in the ACTC1 gene.

Monserrat et al. (2007) screened 247 probands with CMH, CMD, or left
ventricular noncompaction (see LVNC4, 613424) for the E101K mutation,
and identified the mutation in 4 probands with CMH, 2 of whom were
previously studied by Arad et al. (2005), and in 1 proband with LVNC. Of
46 family members with CMH, 23 fulfilled criteria for LVNC, 22 were
diagnosed with apical CMH, and 3 had been diagnosed with restrictive
cardiomyopathy. Septal defects were identified in 9 mutation carriers
from 4 families (8 atrial defects and 1 ventricular), and were absent in
relatives without the mutation. Monserrat et al. (2007) concluded that
LVNC and CMH may appear as overlapping entities, and that E101K should
be considered in the genetic diagnosis of LVNC, apical CMH, and septal
defects.

In 2 unrelated children with idiopathic cardiac hypertrophy and presumed
sporadic cardiomyopathy, Morita et al. (2008) identified 2 different
missense mutations in the ACTC1 gene (see, e.g., 102540.0004); 1 of the
children also carried a missense mutation in the MYH7 gene (160760),
which is known to cause CMH1 (192600). The parents were not studied.

- Left Ventricular Noncompaction 4

Klaassen et al. (2008) analyzed 6 sarcomere protein genes in 63
unrelated adult probands with left ventricular noncompaction (see LVNC4;
613424) and no other congenital heart anomalies and identified the E101K
mutation in the ACTC1 gene in 2 probands.

- Atrial Septal Defect 5

Matsson et al. (2008) analyzed the ACTC1 gene in 2 large Swedish
families segregating autosomal dominant secundum atrial septal defect
(ASD5; 612794) and identified heterozygosity for a mutation (M123V;
102540.0005) in the 20 available affected individuals. The authors
studied 408 additional individuals referred for sporadic congenital
heart disease and identified a 17-bp deletion (102540.0006) in the ACTC1
gene in a 10-year-old girl with secundum ASD.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1R
ACTC1, ARG312HIS

In a 36-year-old mother and 2 daughters, aged 5 and 2 years, of German
ancestry who had dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1R; 613424), Olson et al.
(1998) found a G-to-A substitution in codon 312 in exon 5 of the ACTC
gene, resulting in an arg312-to-his (R312H) amino acid substitution. A
15-year-old son likewise had inherited the mutation but had not
developed dilated cardiomyopathy.

.0002
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1R
ACTC1, GLU361GLY

In a family of Swedish Norwegian ancestry, Olson et al. (1998) found
that a father and son, aged 41 and 14 years, respectively, with dilated
cardiomyopathy-1R (613424) carried a GAG (glu)-to-GGG (gly) mutation in
codon 361 in exon 6 of the ACTC gene. In addition, a 34-year-old woman
with a dilated heart and a 9-year-old with borderline heart size also
had inherited the mutation.

.0003
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 11
ACTC1, ALA295SER

In a 3-generation family with autosomal dominant hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (612098), Mogensen et al. (1999) identified a 253G-T
transversion in exon 5 of the ACTC gene resulting in an ala295-to-ser
substitution. The ala at position 295 is conserved in 19 different
species. The expression of the actin mutation in this family gave the
impression of a highly penetrant disease with diverse phenotypes and
variable age of onset. Only 1 individual of 13 family members carrying
the mutant allele was nonpenetrant, and morbidity was low, as only 3 of
the 13 carrying the mutant allele had symptoms of the disease.

.0004
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 11
ACTC1, HIS90TYR

In a child with idiopathic cardiac hypertrophy and presumed sporadic
cardiomyopathy (612098) who was negative for mutation in 9 of the known
CMH genes, Morita et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous C-to-T
transition in the ACTC1 gene resulting in a his90-to-tyr (H90Y)
substitution. The parents were not studied. The mutation was not found
in unrelated individuals matched by ancestral origin or in more than
1,000 control chromosomes.

.0005
ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT 5
ACTC1, MET123VAL

In 20 affected individuals from 2 Swedish families segregating autosomal
dominant atrial septal defect (ASD5; 612794), Matsson et al. (2008)
identified heterozygosity for a 373A-G transition in exon 2 of the ACTC1
gene, predicted to result in a met123-to-val (M123V) substitution.
Functional analysis of the M123V-mutant protein showed a reduced
affinity for myosin, but retention of actin filament polymerization and
actomyosin motor properties. The mutation was not found in 580 control
samples.

.0006
ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT 5
ACTC1, 17-BP DEL, NT251

In a 10-year-old girl with a secundum atrial septal defect (ASD5;
612794), Matsson et al. (2008) identified heterozygosity for a 17-bp
deletion beginning at nucleotide 251 in exon 2 of the ACTC1 gene,
predicted to result in a severely truncated protein of 86 amino acids in
length. The mutation was also identified in her clinically unaffected
43-year-old father, who was found to have an abnormal echocardiogram
with a posteriorly deviated interventricular septum, believed to be
associated with a spontaneously closed perimembranous ventricular septal
defect, causing aortic valve regurgitation. The deletion was not found
in 580 control samples.

.0007
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 11
ACTC1, ALA331PRO

In a 21-year-old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH11; 612098),
Olson et al. (2000) identified heterozygosity for a G-C transversion in
exon 6 of the ACTC1 gene, resulting in an ala331-to-pro (A331P)
substitution at a highly conserved residue. The patient presented at 8
years of age with 2 near-syncopal episodes and was diagnosed with
idiopathic CMH. At 10 years of age, he was resuscitated from ventricular
fibrillation that occurred while running, and a defibrillator was
placed. Cardiac evaluation revealed hypertrophy of the septum and left
ventricular apex. His unaffected parents did not carry the mutation, nor
was it found in 150 unrelated controls.

.0008
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 11
ACTC1, PRO164ALA

In a 12-year-old boy with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-11 (612098), Olson
et al. (2000) identified heterozygosity for a C-G transversion in exon 2
of the ACTC1 gene, resulting in a pro164-to-ala (P164A) substitution at
a highly conserved residue. The patient was diagnosed with CMH at 17
months of age due to syncopal episodes. He later had occasional episodes
of chest pain, dyspnea, and near-syncope, and underwent insertion of a
pacemaker. Cardiac evaluation revealed hypertrophy of the septum and
left ventricular apex. His unaffected parents did not carry the
mutation, nor was it found in 150 unrelated controls.

.0009
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 11
LEFT VENTRICULAR NONCOMPACTION 4, INCLUDED
ACTC1, GLU101LYS

Using a new numbering system, Arad et al. (2005) designated this
mutation GLU101LYS (E101K).

In 7 affected members of a 4-generation family segregating autosomal
dominant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH11; 612098), Olson et al.
(2000) identified heterozygosity for a G-A transition in exon 2 of the
ACTC1 gene, resulting in a glu99-to-lys (GLU99LYS) substitution at a
highly conserved residue. Apical left ventricular hypertrophy was
present in 5 cases and a trabeculated apex in 2 cases; 2 individuals
also had marked hypertrophy of the interventricular septum without left
ventricular outflow obstruction, and 1 had an atrial septal defect.

In affected members of 2 families segregating autosomal dominant apical
CMH over 3 generations, Arad et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for
the E101K mutation in the ACTC1 gene. A shared haplotype was also
identified, providing odds greater than 100:1 that E101K represents a
founding mutation in the 2 families; however, haplotype data indicated
that E101K arose independently in the family reported by Olson et al.
(2000). Of 18 mutation-positive individuals studied by Arad et al.
(2005), 2 individuals, ages 10 and 29 years, had no clinical evidence of
cardiomyopathy. Isolated apical hypertrophy was found in 5 individuals;
11 others also had mild thickening of the basal segments and/or
involvement of the midventricular segment, and 2 also had trabeculation
of the apex. Right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy in 1 patient
revealed myocyte hypertrophy and disarray with extensive replacement
fibrosis that was more marked than that typically seen in CMH associated
with other morphologic patterns of hypertrophy.

Monserrat et al. (2007) screened 247 probands with CMH, dilated
cardiomyopathy (CMD), or left ventricular noncompaction (see LVNC4,
613424) for the E101K mutation, and identified the mutation in 4
probands with CMH and 1 with LVNC. The 5 mutation-positive families, 2
of which were previously studied by Arad et al. (2005), were all from
the same local area in Galicia, Spain, and shared the same 88-bp allele
of the intragenic ACTC1 microsatellite marker that cosegregated with
disease in the families, suggesting a likely founder effect. Of 46
family members with CMH, 23 fulfilled criteria for LVNC, 22 were
diagnosed with apical CMH, and 3 had been diagnosed with restrictive
cardiomyopathy. Septal defects were identified in 9 mutation carriers
from 4 families (8 atrial defects and 1 ventricular), and were absent in
relatives without the mutation. The E101K mutation was not found in 48
unaffected family members. Monserrat et al. (2007) concluded that LVNC
and CMH may appear as overlapping entities, and that E101K should be
considered in the genetic diagnosis of LVNC, apical CMH, and septal
defects.

In a 15-year-old girl and an unrelated 38-year-old woman with LVNC,
Klaassen et al. (2008) identified heterozygosity for the E101K mutation
in the ACTC1 gene. Both had inherited the mutation from their affected
fathers; haplotype analysis excluded a common ancestor. All 4 patients
had noncompaction of the apex and midventricular wall and no other
congenital cardiac anomalies.

608271	TITLE *608271 MICROTUBULE-ACTIN CROSS-LINKING FACTOR 1; MACF1
;;MACROPHIN 1;;
TRABECULIN-ALPHA;;
ACTIN CROSS-LINKING FACTOR 7; ACF7;;
KIAA1251
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ACF7 is a member of the spectraplakin family of cytoskeletal
cross-linking proteins that possess actin- and microtubule-binding
domains (Kodama et al., 2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned MACF1, which they designated
KIAA1251. The 3-prime UTR of the transcript contains Alu repeat
sequences, and the deduced protein contains 1,483 amino acids. RT-PCR
ELISA detected low expression of MACF1 in lung, ovary, and liver.

Sun et al. (1999) cloned several contiguous partial MACF1 cDNAs from a
prostate cDNA library and assembled the full-length sequence. The
deduced 5,373-amino acid MACF1 protein, which they designated
trabeculin-alpha, has a calculated molecular mass of 614 kD. MACF1 has
an N-terminal actin-binding domain, followed by a plectin (601282)-like
domain, 29 central spectrin (see 182860)-like repeats, and a C-terminal
region that contain 2 tandem Ca(2+)-binding EF-hand motifs, a GAR22
(GAS2L1; 602128)-like domain, and a serine-rich region. The C terminus
also has several putative tyrosine kinase motifs. MACF1 shares 88% amino
acid with its mouse homolog. Northern blot analysis detected MACF1
expression in all tissues examined, with highest expression in heart,
skeletal muscle, prostate, intestine, colon, and gonads. Lowest
expression was in brain, spleen, thymus, liver, placenta, and lung.
Immunofluorescence analysis of several cell lines detected MACF1
distributed in a filamentous network throughout the cytoplasm, with
exclusion from the nucleus.

By PCR of the HepG2 hepatoma cell line with degenerate primers based on
conserved C-terminal domains of FAK (600758) and CAKB (601212), followed
by screening a HepG2 cell line cDNA library, Okuda et al. (1999) cloned
MACF1, which they designated macrophin. The deduced 5,430-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 620 kD. RT-PCR detected high
expression in heart, placenta, liver, kidney, and pancreas, moderate
expression in brain and lung, and weak expression in skeletal muscle. In
situ hybridization of pancreas showed mRNA mainly in acinar tissue.

By searching sequence databases using a chicken partial cDNA that was
differentially expressed during regeneration of the auditory epithelium
after noise trauma, followed by screening pituitary gland and heart cDNA
libraries, Gong et al. (2001) cloned a splice variant of MACF1. The
deduced protein, which they called MACF1-4, has a calculated molecular
mass of 670 kD, contains 8 N-terminal plectin repeats, and has no
actin-binding domain. The authors noted that 3 other splice variants
with different N termini had been identified for mouse Macf1. mRNA dot
blot analysis showed that MACF1 was expressed ubiquitously, with highest
expression in pituitary, adrenal, thyroid, salivary gland, mammary
gland, pancreas, heart, and skeletal muscle. mRNA dot blot analysis
using a riboprobe specific for the MACF1-4 variant showed highest
expression in heart, lung, pituitary gland, and placenta. PCR analysis
using MACF1-4-specific primers detected MACF1-4 in lung, heart,
pituitary, and placenta, but not in brain, kidney, liver, pancreas,
skeletal muscle, or HepG2 hepatoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By sedimentation binding assay, Sun et al. (1999) confirmed that the
N-terminal actin-binding domain of MACF1 coprecipitated with F-actin.
Cytochalasin D disruption of actin filaments also resulted in a marked
but incomplete disruption of MACF1 fine filament structures and the
appearance of punctate aggregates of MACF1. Mouse Macf1 mRNA levels
increased steadily during formation of fused myotubes during
differentiation in a mouse myoblasts cell line. Kodama et al. (2003)
showed that mouse Acf7 is an essential integrator of microtubule-actin
dynamics. In mouse endodermal cells, Acf7 bound along microtubules, but
concentrated at their distal ends and at cell borders when polarized. In
the absence of Acf7, microtubules still bound Eb1 (603108) and Clip170
(179838), but they no longer grew along polarized actin bundles, nor did
they pause and tether to actin-rich cortical sites. The consequences
were long, less stable microtubules with skewed cytoplasmic trajectories
and altered dynamic instability. In response to wounding, Acf7 null
cultures activated polarizing signals, but they failed to maintain them
and coordinate migration. Rescue of these defects required the actin-
and microtubule-binding domains of Acf7. Kodama et al. (2003) concluded
that spectraplakins are important for controlling microtubule dynamics
and reinforcing links between microtubules and polarized F-actin, so
that cellular polarization and coordinated cell movements can be
sustained.

Chen et al. (2006) found that siRNA knockdown of Macf1 inhibited Wnt
signaling (see WNT1; 164820) in a mouse embryonic carcinoma cell line.
Reporter gene assays indicated that Macf1 acted upstream of Gsk3b
(605004) in the Wnt signaling pathway. Macf1 interacted directly with
Axin (see AXIN1, 603816) and translocated with the Axin complex to the
cell membrane upon Wnt stimulation.

A resident population of adult stem cells (SCs) in hair follicles is
involved in hair growth and in epidermal reepithelialization during
wound healing. Wu et al. (2011) found that adult mouse hair follicle SCs
expressed high levels of Acf7 and that phosphorylation of Acf7 by
Gsk3-beta reduced the affinity of Acf7 for microtubules. Expression of a
constitutively active Gsk3-beta mutant in hair follicle SCs resulted in
elevated phosphorylation of Acf7 and altered microtubule structure
similar to that in Acf7-knockout cells. Conversely, inhibition of
Gsk3-beta increased microtubule binding by endogenous Acf7 in hair
follicle SCs. SC migration in a wound-healing assay was inhibited by
Acf7 knockout and by both over- and underactivation of Gsk3-beta. Wu et
al. (2011) concluded that cyclic phosphorylation of Acf7 by Gsk3-beta is
required for Acf7- and microtubule-based cell migration in hair follicle
SCs.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gong et al. (2001) determined that the MACF1 gene contains at least 102
exons and spans more than 270 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the MACF1 gene
to chromosome 1. Okuda et al. (1999) mapped the MACF1 gene to chromosome
1p32-p31 by radiation hybrid analysis and genomic sequence analysis. By
FISH, Sun et al. (1999) mapped the MACF1 gene to chromosome 1p34.2-p33.
Gong et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Macf1 gene to a region of mouse
chromosome 4 that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 1p32.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chen et al. (2006) found that Macf1 -/- mice died at the gastrulation
stage and displayed developmental retardation at embryonic day 7.5 with
defects in the formation of the primitive streak, node, and mesoderm.
The phenotype was similar to that of Wnt3 (165330)-null mice and Lrp5
(604506)/Lrp6 (603507) double-knockout mice.

601814	TITLE *601814 FXYD DOMAIN-CONTAINING ION TRANSPORT REGULATOR 2; FXYD2
;;SODIUM-POTASSIUM-ATPase, GAMMA-1 POLYPEPTIDE; ATP1G1
DESCRIPTION The gene family FXYD (pronounced fix-id) consists of small membrane
proteins containing a core motif of 35 invariant and conserved amino
acids centered on a single transmembrane span.

CLONING

Kim et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA encoding the sodium-potassium-ATPase
gamma-subunit polypeptide from a human fetal liver cDNA library. The
deduced amino acid sequence of the protein comprises 58 amino acids with
a calculated molecular weight of 6,400 Da and shows about 86% homology
when compared with those of the bovine, rat, and mouse gamma subunits.
Northern blot analysis showed that the cDNA hybridizes to a 0.7-kb mRNA
that is expressed in human kidney, pancreas, and fetal liver. See ATP1A1
(182310).

By EST database searching and in silico analysis, Sweadner and Rael
(2000) identified genes and protein sequences for 7 FXYD molecules in
rodents and humans. The deduced FXYD2 protein, the smallest of the 7,
has 2 variants. The gamma-b isoform contains 66 amino acids and has no
signal peptide. Sweadner and Rael (2000) noted that ESTs for FXYD2 are
found in muscle, blood, and transport tissues, particularly kidney, but
not in nervous system tissues, suggesting wide but not ubiquitous
expression.

Sweadner et al. (2000) purified Na,K-ATPase-enriched membranes from rat
and human kidneys. By Western blot analysis, they confirmed that both
rat and human FXYD2 proteins migrate as doublets, with apparent
molecular masses of 7.9 and 6.9 kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sweadner et al. (2000) determined that the FXYD2 gene contains 7 exons
and spans 9.2 kb. They identified 2 alternatively spliced exons encoding
different N termini as well as 2 candidate promoters with consensus
sites for transcription factors SP1, AP1 and AP2, consistent with
independent transcription of the splice variants. The gene has a high
concentration of repeat elements.

MAPPING

Annabi et al. (1998) mapped the gene for glycogen storage disease Ib
(232220) to a 3-cM region on 11q23, between markers D11S939 and
D11S4129. They found that the IL10R (146933), ATP1G1, and ALL1 (159555)
genes were present in the same interval, in that order from centromere
to telomere.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Morth et al. (2007) presented the x-ray crystal structure at
3.5-angstrom resolution of the pig renal sodium-potassium-ATPase
(Na+,K(+)-ATPase) with 2 rubidium ions bound (as potassium congeners) in
an occluded state in the transmembrane part of the alpha-subunit.
Several of the residues forming the cavity for rubidium/potassium
occlusion in the Na+,K(+)-ATPase are homologous to those binding calcium
in the calcium-ion ATPase of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum (SERCA1;
108730). The beta and gamma subunits specific to the Na+,K(+)-ATPase are
associated with transmembrane helices alpha-M7/alpha-M10, and alpha-M9,
respectively. The gamma subunit corresponds to a fragment of the V-type
ATPase c subunit. The carboxy terminus of the alpha subunit is contained
within a pocket between transmembrane helices and seems to be a novel
regulatory element controlling sodium affinity, possibly influenced by
the membrane potential.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Autosomal dominant isolated renal magnesium loss (154020) is due to loss
of magnesium in the kidney. It is usually associated with lowered
urinary excretion of calcium, presumably as a consequence of increased
reabsorption of calcium in the loop of Henle. By a candidate gene
approach, following mapping of the disorder to 11q23, Meij et al. (2000)
identified a putative dominant-negative mutation in the gene encoding
the Na+,K(+)-ATPase gamma subunit (601814.0001), leading to defective
routing of the protein, which failed to find its way to the plasma
membrane. This is a small, type I membrane protein localized on
basolateral membranes of nephron epithelial cells and expressed in the
distal convoluted tubule, the main site of active renal Mg(2+)
reabsorption. This was said to be the first time that mutations in a
gene encoding an Na+,K(+)-ATPase subunit had been implicated in human
disease.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOMAGNESEMIA 2, RENAL
FXYD2, GLY41ARG

In patients with dominant isolated renal magnesium loss (154020), Meij
et al. (2000) identified a heterozygous mutation, 121G-A, in the FXYD2
gene that cosegregated with the disorder. The mutation caused a
substitution of the conserved glycine-41 within the putative
transmembrane domain by arginine.

611748	TITLE *611748 OTU DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 7B; OTUD7B
;;CELLULAR ZINC FINGER ANTI-NFKB;;
CEZANNE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to A20 (TNFAIP3;
191163), followed by RACE PCR of human peripheral blood lymphocyte cDNA,
Evans et al. (2001) cloned OTUD7B, which they called Cezanne. The
deduced protein contains more than 800 amino acids and has an N-terminal
TRAF (see TRAF1; 601711)-binding domain, a putative nuclear localization
signal, and a C-terminal A20-like zinc finger domain. Northern blot
analysis detected a major 6-kb transcript in human epithelial cells and
fibroblasts and in a liver carcinoma cell line. Epithelial cells and
fibroblasts also expressed a minor 9.5-kb transcript. Both transcripts
were detected in human tissues, with prominent expression in heart.
RT-PCR showed highest levels of Cezanne in kidney, heart, and fetal
liver. Fluorescence-tagged Cezanne distributed diffusely within the
cytoplasm of fibroblasts and epithelial cells and showed some nuclear
staining in endothelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Evans et al. (2001) showed that expression of Cezanne in HEK293 human
embryonic kidney cells reduced NF-kappa-B (see 164011) activity in a
dose-dependent manner following stimulation with TNF-alpha (TNF;
191160). When overexpressed in HEK293 cells, exogenous A20, Cezanne, and
TRABID (ZRANB1; 611749) coimmunoprecipitated with TRAF6 (602355).

Evans et al. (2003) reported that the N-terminal catalytic domain of
Cezanne is similar to the OTU superfamily of proteins, which share
structural similarity with cysteine proteinases. They identified Cezanne
as a deubiquitinating enzyme. Recombinant Cezanne cleaved ubiquitin
monomers from linear or branched synthetic ubiquitin chains and from
ubiquitinated proteins. Mutation of a conserved cysteine (cys209) in the
catalytic site of the proteolytic domain caused Cezanne to coprecipitate
polyubiquitinated cellular proteins. In addition to the N-terminal
catalytic domain, a C-terminal domain was required for efficient
hydrolysis of both free and conjugated forms of branched ubiquitin
chains.

Hu et al. (2013) identified the deubiquitinase OTUD7B as a pivotal
regulator of the noncanonical NF-kappa-B pathway. OTUD7B deficiency in
mice has no appreciable effect on canonical NF-kappa-B activation but
causes hyperactivation of noncanonical NF-kappa-B. In response to
noncanonical NF-kappa-B stimuli, OTUD7B binds and deubiquitinates TRAF3
(601896), thereby inhibiting TRAF3 proteolysis and preventing aberrant
noncanonical NF-kappa-B activation. Consequently, the OTUD7B deficiency
results in B-cell hyperresponsiveness to antigens, lymphoid follicular
hyperplasia in the intestinal mucosa, and elevated host-defense ability
against an intestinal bacterial pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. Hu et
al. (2013) concluded that their findings established OTUD7B as a crucial
regulator of signal-induced noncanonical NF-kappa-B activation, and
indicated a mechanism of immune regulation that involves OTUD7B-mediated
deubiquitination and stabilization of TRAF3.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the OTUD7B
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP G20321).

604696	TITLE *604696 A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN 11; AKAP11
;;A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN, 220-KD; AKAP220
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs; see 602449) direct the activity of
protein kinase A (PKA; see 176911) by tethering the enzyme near its
physiologic substrates.

CLONING

By screening rat pituitary and olfactory bulb cDNA libraries with a PKA
type II regulatory (RII) probe, Lester et al. (1996) identified a novel
AKAP, AKAP11, which the authors designated AKAP220. The AKAP11 protein
has 1,129 amino acids and contains a PKA-binding region and a peroxisome
targeting motif. Immunohistochemical analysis of rat testis cells showed
that AKAP220 and a proportion of RII PKA are colocalized in microbodies
that appear to be a subset of peroxisomes. By RT-PCR analysis, Ishikawa
et al. (1998) detected expression of human AKAP11 in heart, brain, lung,
liver, kidney, testis, and ovary, with weaker expression in skeletal
muscle, pancreas, and spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

Logue et al. (2011) showed that AKAP220 interacts with the cytoskeletal
scaffolding protein IQGAP1 (603379) at the leading edges of migrating
cells. The AKAP220/IQGAP1 complex was proposed to form a component of a
microtubule-associated network of several proteins, including CLASP2
(605853), that receive and process calcium and cAMP second messenger
signals. Silencing of the AKAP220 gene retarded cell migration in human
cancer cells.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the AKAP11
gene, which they designated KIAA0629, to human chromosome 13.

;;BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN, PLACENTA; PLAB;;
PROSTATE-DERIVED FACTOR; PDF;;
MACROPHAGE-INHIBITING CYTOKINE 1; MIC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GDF15 is a distant member of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP; see
112264) subfamily of the transforming growth factor-beta (see TGFB1;
190180) superfamily. GDF15 is weakly expressed under normal conditions,
but it is sharply upregulated during inflammation and acts as an
autocrine regulator of macrophage activation. In addition to its effects
on macrophages, GDF15 is a downstream target of p53 (TP53; 191170) that
may be involved in the injury response to DNA damage and in cancer
(summary by de Jager et al., 2011).

CLONING

By screening a full-length cDNA library constructed from a fibrosarcoma
cell line for secretory proteins, Yokoyama-Kobayashi et al. (1997)
isolated a cDNA encoding a 308-amino acid protein related to TGFB.
Northern blot analysis detected strongest expression of a 1.35-kb
transcript in placenta, with lower levels in prostate and colon and some
expression in kidney. By searching an EST database for TGFB/BMP-related
sequences, Hromas et al. (1997) identified a cDNA encoding an identical
protein, which they called PLAB (placental BMP). Through analysis of
hematopoietic progenitor proliferation, they found that PLAB reduces the
growth of granulocytes and macrophages.

By searching an EST database, followed by screening a placenta cDNA
library, Paralkar et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA encoding PLAB, which
they called PDF (prostate-derived factor). Western blot analysis showed
that PDF is expressed as a 16-kD protein under reducing conditions. In
situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that
PDF is expressed at high levels in cells of the terminal villi in
placenta and in the epithelium of prostate but not in other accessory
male genital glands.

Using subtraction cloning in a monocyte/macrophage cell line, Bootcov et
al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding PLAB, which they called MIC1
(macrophage-inhibiting cytokine-1). Sequence analysis predicted that the
mature secreted MIC1 protein contains 224 amino acids. Northern blot
analysis showed that MIC1 is not expressed in undifferentiated cells but
is progressively upregulated upon differentiation with retinoic acid
followed by phorbol ester or cytokine (e.g., TNFA; 191160) treatment.
Exposure of macrophages to MIC1 or TGFB1, followed by stimulation with
lipopolysaccharide, suppressed the production of TNFA.

Unlike most TGFB superfamily members, in which the amino acid sequence
is completely conserved, MIC1 shares only 70% amino acid identity with
its rodent counterparts (Bottner et al., 1999).

GENE STRUCTURE

Bottner et al. (1999) determined that the MIC1 gene is composed of 2
exons separated by an approximately 3-kb intron.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Bottner et al. (1999) mapped the MIC1 gene to 19p13.2-p13.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Moore et al. (2000) used a sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for quantification of MIC1 to examine the
role of this cytokine in pregnancy. High levels of MIC1 are present in
the sera of pregnant women; the levels rise substantially with progress
of gestation. MIC1 is also present in large amounts in amniotic fluid
and placental extracts. In addition, the BeWo placental trophoblastic
cell line constitutively expresses the MIC1 transcript and secretes
large amounts of MIC1. The authors concluded that the placental
trophoblast is a major source of the MIC1 present in maternal serum and
amniotic fluid. They inferred that MIC1 may promote fetal survival by
suppressing the production of maternally derived proinflammatory
cytokines within the uterus.

Tong et al. (2004) measured serum concentrations of MIC1 in 100
asymptomatic women at 6 to 13 weeks' gestation who subsequently
miscarried or who had already miscarried. Their MIC1 concentrations were
one-third of those measured in 197 patients who had ongoing pregnancies.
Concentrations were just as low 3 weeks before diagnosis as on the day
of diagnosis, suggesting possible predictive and causative roles.

Johnen et al. (2007) found that nude mice injected with human prostate
cancer cells stably expressing MIC1 showed weight loss that correlated
with levels of serum MIC1. Weight loss was due to reduced food intake
and could be reversed by treatment with anti-MIC1. Tumor size was not
affected by anti-MIC1. Elevated serum MIC1 levels correlated with
greater weight loss in patients with advanced prostate cancer and lower
body mass index in patients with chronic renal failure. Transgenic mice
overexpressing Mic1 were smaller and ate less than wildtype mice.
Injection of Mic1 activated hypothalamic, notably arcuate, neurons
through Tgfbr2 (190182), as demonstrated by enhanced Fos (164810) and
Stat3 (102582) expression. Hypothalamic overexpression of Mic1 induced
rapid weight loss in mice. Johnen et al. (2007) concluded that MIC1 is a
central regulator of appetite and weight and is a potential target for
treatment of cancer, anorexia, and weight loss.

Tanno et al. (2007) hypothesized that accumulation of iron in the
absence of blood transfusions in thalassemia patients may result from
inappropriate suppression of the iron-regulating peptide hepcidin
(606464) by an erythropoietic mechanism. To test this hypothesis, Tanno
et al. (2007) examined erythroblast transcriptome profiles from 15
healthy nonthalassemic donors. GDF15 showed increased expression and
secretion during erythroblast maturation. Healthy volunteers had mean
GDF15 serum concentrations of 450 +/- 50 pg/ml. In comparison,
individuals with beta-thalassemia syndromes had elevated GDF15 serum
levels (mean 66,000 +/- 9,600 pg/ml; range 4,800-248,000 pg/ml; P less
than 0.05) that were positively correlated with the levels of soluble
transferrin receptor (190010), erythropoietin (133170), and ferritin
(see 134790). Serum from thalassemia patients suppressed hepcidin mRNA
expression in primary human hepatocytes, and depletion of GDF15 reversed
hepcidin suppression. Tanno et al. (2007) concluded that GDF15
overexpression arising from an expanded erythroid compartment
contributes to iron overload in thalassemia syndromes by inhibiting
hepcidin expression.

Kempf et al. (2011) observed that GDF15 expression increased in mouse
and human heart within hours after myocardial infarction and remained
elevated in the infarcted myocardium for several days. They found that
Gdf15 -/- mice exhibited greatly increased mortality compared with
wildtype mice following coronary artery ligation. These Gdf15 -/- mice
showed increased myocardial rupture and hemothorax and an enhanced
inflammatory reaction characterized by elevated infiltration of the
infarcted area with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and elevated
Mmp9 (120361) expression and activity. Recombinant human GDF15 inhibited
mouse and human PMN adhesion and transmigration by inhibiting beta-2
integrin (ITGB2; 600065) clustering and activation. GDF15 inhibited
integrin activation by interfering with activation of the small GTPase
Rap1 (RAP1A; 179520) and by directly activating the small GTPase Cdc42
(116952). Kempf et al. (2011) concluded that GDF15 functions as an
antiinflammatory cytokine by directly interfering with chemokine
signaling and integrin activation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

MIC1 is expressed in activated but not resting macrophages. Two allelic
forms of the MIC1 gene were identified by Fairlie et al. (2001), one of
which has a SNP causing a his6-to-asp substitution in the MIC1 protein.
The homozygous asp (D) allele is present in approximately 5% of normal
individuals. Because of the different properties of the amino acids, the
polymorphism could alter the function of MIC1. Brown et al. (2002) noted
that activated macrophages have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis and vascular occlusion and that strong epidemiologic
data have linked measurement of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive
protein (123260) and interleukin-6 (147620) with risk of vascular
occlusive events. As part of the Women's Health Study, a large primary
prevention trial of aspirin and vitamin E in American women, Brown et
al. (2002) investigated the possible relationship between MIC1
concentration in plasma and risk of cardiovascular events in women.
Plasma MIC1 concentrations were higher at baseline in women who
subsequently had cardiovascular events than in those who did not.
Concentrations above the 90th percentile were associated with a 2.7-fold
increase in risk. The effect was independent of traditional
cardiovascular risk factors and at least additive to that of C-reactive
protein. There was no significant association between the MIC1
polymorphism identified by Fairlie et al. (2001) and vascular events.

ANIMAL MODEL

De Jager et al. (2011) noted that elevated GDF15 serum levels are
associated with risk for acute coronary syndromes. They found that Gdf15
expression was upregulated in a mouse model of atherosclerosis.
Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated colocalization of Gdf15 with
plaque macrophages. Hematopoietic cells lacking Gdf15 in Ldlr (606945)
-/- mice had impaired initial lesion formation due to reduced Ccr2
(601267) chemotaxis and increased collagen in later lesions. De Jager et
al. (2011) concluded that GDF15 deficiency improves atherosclerotic
plaque stability by enhancing collagen deposition and decreasing
necrotic core expansion.

607351	TITLE *607351 RHO-RELATED BTB DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; RHOBTB1
;;KIAA0740
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the RHOBTB subfamily of Rho GTPases are evolutionarily
conserved. They are characterized by a modular organization, consisting
of a GTPase domain, a proline-rich region, a tandem of 2 BTB (broad
complex, tramtrack, and bric-a-brac) domains, and a conserved C-terminal
region. The BTB domain, also known as a POZ (poxvirus and zinc finger)
domain, is involved in protein-protein interactions.

CLONING

By randomly sequencing clones from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) obtained a cDNA encoding RHOBTB1, which
they called KIAA0740. The deduced protein contains 532 amino acids and
shares 39% identity with RAC1 (602048). RT-PCR followed by ELISA
revealed ubiquitous but variable expression, with highest levels in
skeletal muscle, kidney, and ovary.

By searching an EST database, Ramos et al. (2002) obtained full-length
cDNAs encoding RHOBTB1, RHOBTB2 (607352), and RHOBTB3 (607353). RHOBTB1
contains all the domains characteristic of RHOBTB proteins. The
C-terminal domain consists of about 80 amino acids in 4 consecutive
alpha helices, with the last third having a high content of charged
residues. RHOBTB1 and RHOBTB2 share 77% nucleotide identity, and RHOBTB1
shares 84% nucleotide identity with mouse Rhobtb1. Northern dot blot
analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of RHOBTB1, with highest levels
in skeletal muscle, placenta, testis, stomach, and kidney, followed by
uterus and adrenal gland. RHOBTB1 was expressed in a variety of fetal
tissues. In mouse, expression of Rhobtb1 was highest in heart and
testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ramos et al. (2002) determined that the RHOBTB1 gene contains 9 exons
and spans about 75 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ramos et al. (2002) mapped the RHOBTB1
gene to chromosome 10q21.1, downstream of the CDC2 gene (116940) and
upstream of the EGR2 gene (129010).

612655	TITLE *612655 TBC1 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 7; TBC1D7
;;CELL MIGRATION-INDUCING PROTEIN 23;;
PIG51;;
TBC7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TBC1D7 belongs to a family of proteins sharing a 180- to 200-amino acid
TBC domain presumed to have a role in regulating cell growth and
differentiation. These proteins share significant homology with TRE2
(USP6; 604334), yeast Bub2, and CDC16 (603461) (Nakashima et al., 2007).

CLONING

Nakashima et al. (2007) identified TBC1D7, which they called TBC7, by
coimmunoprecipitation with the tuberous sclerosis complex proteins TSC1
(605284) and TSC2 (191092) from transfected HEK293 cells. The deduced
293-amino acid TBC1D7 protein contains a putative TBC domain. SDS-PAGE
showed that TBC1D7 was expressed as a 30-kD protein. Northern blot
analysis detected an approximately 1.1-kb transcript with high
expression in human heart and low expression in kidney, liver, and
placenta. Immunofluorescence studies colocalized TBC1D7 and TSC1 to the
cytoplasm when expressed in NIH3T3 cells; with subcellular
fractionation, TBC1D7 localized to the cytoplasmic vesicles of the
endomembrane in a complex with TSC1-TSC2.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoblot and GST pull-down assay, Nakashima et al. (2007) confirmed
that TBC1D7 interacted with the TSC1-TSC2 complex. Further studies
showed that TBC1D7 interacted directly with TSC1 through the C-terminal
half of the TSC1 coiled-coil domain. Overexpression of TBC1D7 caused an
increase in phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein (RPS6; 180460) at
ser235/236 by RPS6 kinase (RPS6KB1; 608938) activation, suggesting that
TBC1D7 plays a role in positive regulation of the mTOR-signaling
pathway. Overexpression of TBC1D7 also increased TSC1 ubiquitination.

602123	TITLE *602123 CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE II-GAMMA; CAMK2G
;;CaM KINASE II GAMMA SUBUNIT;;
CAMKG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) is a
ubiquitous serine/threonine protein kinase that has been implicated in
diverse effects of hormones and neurotransmitters that utilize Ca(2+) as
a second messenger. The enzyme is an oligomeric protein composed of
distinct but related subunits, alpha (114078), beta (607707), gamma, and
delta (607708), each encoded by a separate gene. Each subunit has
alternatively spliced variants.

CLONING

Breen and Ashcroft (1997) cloned and sequenced a novel CaM kinase
II-gamma cDNA from human islet cell RNA. This isoform, designated
gamma-SRP by the authors, encodes a truncated gamma CaM kinase II in
which the 3-prime end consists of 804 basepairs of the human SRP72 gene
(602122).

Tombes and Krystal (1997) identified a number of CAMKG variants
expressed by neuronal cells. Two variants were consistently expressed in
nonneuronal cell lines, and another was preferentially expressed in
tumor cells.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Li et al. (1994) mapped the CAMK2G gene to human
chromosome 10q22. Ahmed et al. (2001) stated that CAMK2G is 1 of 3 genes
that are nested in the introns of PCDH15 (605514).

GENE FUNCTION

In mouse cardiomyocytes, Zhu et al. (2003) demonstrated that
beta-1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1; 109630)-induced apoptosis was
resistant to inhibition of PKA (see 176911). Rather, the Adrb1
proapoptotic effect was associated with non-Pka-dependent increases in
intracellular Ca(2+) and Camk2 activity. Blocking the L-type Ca(2+)
channel (see 114205), buffering intracellular Ca(2+), or inhibiting
Camk2 activity fully protected cardiomyocytes against Adrb1-induced
apoptosis; overexpressing the c splice variant of Camk2d markedly
exaggerated the Adrb1 apoptotic effect. Zhu et al. (2003) concluded that
CAMK2 constitutes a PKA-independent linkage of ADRB1 stimulation to
cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

Among 304 Swiss individuals tested and genotyped, de Quervain and
Papassotiropoulos (2006) found a significant association (p = 0.00008)
between short-term episodic memory performance and genetic variations in
a 7-gene cluster consisting of the ADCY8 (103070), PRKACG (176893),
CAMK2G, GRIN2A (138253), GRIN2B (138252), GRM3 (601115), and PRKCA
(176960) genes, all of which have well-established molecular and
biologic functions in animal memory. Functional MRI studies in an
independent set of 32 individuals with similar memory performance showed
a correlation between activation in memory-related brain regions,
including the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, and genetic
variability in the 7-gene cluster. De Quervain and Papassotiropoulos
(2006) concluded that these 7 genes encode proteins of the memory
formation signaling cascade that are important for human memory
function.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of mutation in the CAMK2G gene as a possible cause of an
intellectual disability phenotype, see 602123.0001.

ANIMAL MODEL

To study the role of CaMKII in T cells, Bui et al. (2000) generated
transgenic mice expressing a partially calcium-independent mutant form
of CAMKG (thr287 to asp). The size of the thymus was increased 1.5- to
2-fold in these mice, at least in part due to an increase in the life
span of double-positive thymocytes. There was an increase in the number
of T cells in the secondary lymphoid organs that had acquired an
antigen-dependent memory phenotype. These T cells were bona fide memory
cells as assessed by a variety of criteria. In addition, T cells from
wildtype mice acquired calcium-independent CaMKII activity after several
rounds of antigen-stimulated division. The authors proposed that CaMKII
controls a distinct process of activation-induced cellular
differentiation.

Using gene targeting, Zhang et al. (2005) developed a mouse model of
cardiac Camk2 inhibition and demonstrated substantial prevention of
maladaptive remodeling from excessive beta-adrenergic receptor
stimulation and myocardial infarction, and induction of balanced changes
in excitation-contraction coupling that preserved baseline and
beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated physiologic increases in cardiac
function. Zhang et al. (2005) concluded that CAMK2 is a determinant of
clinically important heart disease phenotypes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
CAMK2G, ARG292PRO

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to intellectual disability has not been confirmed.

In a boy with severe intellectual disability with self mutilation,
myopia, strabismus, mitochondrial dysfunction without mitochondrial gene
defects, short stature, flat face with narrow forehead, long palpebral
fissures, arched eyebrows, sacral dimple, short hands, brachydactyly,
and short feet, de Ligt et al. (2012) identified a de novo heterozygous
875G-C transversion resulting in an arg29-to-pro (R29P) substitution.
The patient had normal array and MLL2 testing.

615187	TITLE *615187 POST-GPI ATTACHMENT TO PROTEINS 2; PGAP2
;;FGF RECEPTOR-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 1; FRAG1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) modification of plasma membrane
proteins occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and GPI-anchored
proteins are incorporated into rafts in the Golgi during their transport
to the cell surface. PGAP2 appears to be involved in maturation of the
GPI anchor on GPI-anchored proteins (Tashima et al., 2006).

CLONING

By screening an M426 human embryonic fibroblast cell line with rat
Frag1, Lorenzi et al. (1999) cloned PGAP2, which they called FRAG1. The
deduced 316-amino acid protein has 2 N-terminal FRAG1 homology (FH)
domains and 4 possible isoprenylation signals. Hydropathy analysis
suggested that FRAG1 has 7 transmembrane segments. Human and rat FRAG1
share 92% amino acid identity, but the rat protein has only 1 FH domain.
Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of a 2.0-kb FRAG1
transcript in all 16 tissues examined, with highest expression in testis
and pancreas, and lowest expression in brain and thymus. A transcript of
about 3.2 kb was also detected in several tissues, predominantly
pancreas, spleen, and prostate. FRAG1 was also detected in a number of
tumor cell lines at a level comparable to that observed in normal
tissues.

By database analysis and cloning using rat and hamster cDNA libraries,
Tashima et al. (2006) identified human, rat, and hamster cDNAs encoding
a 254-amino acid PGAP2 protein. They also identified a splice variant in
human and hamster that encodes a 250-amino acid isoform lacking a VSQE
sequence. Rat Pgap2 localized to Golgi in transfected NRK cells.

Hansen et al. (2013) stated that the PGAP2 gene encodes 16 different RNA
transcripts, 8 of which encode different isoforms and 8 that are
noncoding RNA. Isoform 8, which is 254 amino acids long and contains 5
alpha-helix domains embedded in the Golgi membrane, is believed to be
the biologically active isoform. The N terminus is in the cytoplasm and
the C terminus is in the Golgi lumen.

GENE FUNCTION

Tashima et al. (2006) found that transfected CHO cells lacking Pgap2
were deficient in cell surface expression of the human GPI-anchored
proteins CD59 (107271) and CD55 (125240). Cotransfection of rat Pgap2 or
the human or hamster variant encoding the short PGAP2 isoform restored
CD59 surface expression. GPI-anchored proteins appeared to traffic
normally through the ER and Golgi, but they were secreted upon arrival
at the plasma membrane via phospholipid D (see 602382)-like activity.
The secreted proteins showed an altered GPI anchor. Tashima et al.
(2006) proposed that remodeling of the GPI anchor occurs in GPI-anchored
proteins, and that in Pgap2-deficient cells, this remodeling is
defective, resulting in GPI-anchored proteins that are sensitive to
cleavage then secretion from the plasma membrane.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lorenzi et al. (1999) determined that the PGAP2 gene contains 6 exons
and spans over 7 kb. The tandem FH domains in the FRAG1 protein are
encoded by exons 1 and 2.

MAPPING

Using FISH and radiation hybrid analysis, Lorenzi et al. (1999) mapped
the PGAP2 gene to chromosome 11p15.5.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 2 unrelated consanguineous families with
hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome-3 (HPMRS3; 614207),
Hansen et al. (2013) identified 2 different homozygous missense
mutations in the PGAP2 gene (615187.0001 and 615187.0002, respectively).
In vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant alleles
were hypomorphic and caused decreased enzyme activity. Hansen et al.
(2013) commented that the disorder due to PGAP2 mutations can be viewed
as part of a disease family representing a spectrum of disorders due to
mutations in genes involved in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor
biosynthesis. Mutations in genes earlier in the pathway appear to cause
a more severe phenotype, including dysmorphic features (e.g., MCAHS1,
614080), than mutations in genes that act later in the pathway.

Among 13 individuals with intellectual disability and increased serum
alkaline phosphatase who were screened for mutations in genes encoding
proteins in the GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway, Krawitz et al. (2013)
found that 2 unrelated patients carried biallelic missense mutations in
the PGAP2 gene (615187.0003-615187.0005). In vitro studies showed that
the mutations caused decreased enzyme activity.

PGAP2, TYR99CYS

In 3 affected members of a consanguineous Syrian family (MR043) with
autosomal recessive hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation-3 (HPMRS3;
614207) originally reported by Abou Jamra et al. (2011), Hansen et al.
(2013) identified a homozygous c.296A-G transition in the PGAP2 gene,
resulting in a tyr99-to-cys (Y99C) substitution between transmembrane
segments 1 and 2 in the Golgi lumen. The mutation, which was found by
exome sequencing of the linked region on chromosome 11p15, was confirmed
by Sanger sequencing and segregated with the disorder in the family. In
vitro functional expression studies in CHO cells showed that the mutant
protein was expressed but had significantly decreased activity compared
to wildtype. Patient lymphoblastoid cells showed essentially normal
expression of the GPI-anchored proteins DAF (125240) and CD59 (107271),
supporting a hypomorphic effect of the Y99C mutation.

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family (MR5) with
HPMRS3 (614207) originally reported by Rehman et al. (2011), Hansen et
al. (2013) identified a homozygous c.530G-C transversion in the PGAP2
gene, resulting in an arg177-to-pro (R177P) substitution between
transmembrane segments 3 and 4 in the Golgi lumen. The mutation, which
was found by exome sequencing of the linked region on chromosome 11p15,
was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and segregated with the disorder in
the family. In vitro functional expression studies in CHO cells showed
that the mutant protein was expressed but had significantly decreased
activity compared to wildtype. Patient lymphoblastoid cells showed
essentially normal expression of the GPI-anchored proteins DAF (125240)
and CD59 (107271), supporting a hypomorphic effect of the R177P
mutation.

PGAP2, LEU127SER

In a Turkish boy, born of consanguineous parents, with HPMRS3 (614207),
Krawitz et al. (2013) identified a homozygous c.380T-C transition in the
PGAP2 gene, resulting in a leu127-to-ser (L127S) substitution at a
highly conserved residue. The mutation segregated with the disorder in
the family. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutant protein had decreased activity compared to wildtype.

HYPERPHOSPHATASIA WITH MENTAL RETARDATION SYNDROME 3
PGAP2, ARG16TRP

In a 28-year-old Finnish woman with mild HPMRS3 (614207), Krawitz et al.
(2013) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PGAP2
gene: a c.46C-T transition resulting in an arg16-to-trp (R16W)
substitution, and a c.479C-T transition resulting in a thr160-to-ile
(T160I; 615187.0005) substitution. Both mutations occurred at highly
conserved residues. In vitro functional expression studies showed that
the mutant proteins had decreased activity compared to wildtype. Higher
residual activity of R16W may explain the milder phenotype in this
patient.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CDKN2A gene encodes proteins that regulate 2 critical cell cycle
regulatory pathways, the p53 (TP53; 191170) pathway and the RB1 (614041)
pathway. Through the use of shared coding regions and alternative
reading frames, the CDKN2A gene produces 2 major proteins: p16(INK4),
which is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, and p14(ARF), which binds
the p53-stabilizing protein MDM2 (164785) (Robertson and Jones, 1999).

CLONING

Using CDK4 (123829) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Serrano et al.
(1993) cloned human CDKN2A, which they designated p16(INK4). The deduced
148-amino acid protein contained 4 ankyrin repeats and had a calculated
molecular mass of 15.8 kD.

Kamb et al. (1994) identified a putative tumor suppressor locus in
chromosome band 9p21, within a region of less than 40 kb, by means of
analyzing homozygous deletions in melanoma cell lines. The region was
found to contain a gene, called MTS1 (for multiple tumor suppressor-1),
that encodes a previously identified inhibitor (p16) of CDK4. The
sequence of the MTS1 gene as determined by Kamb et al. (1994) was
identical to that of the p16 gene as determined by Serrano et al.
(1993).

Using a p16 probe, Stone et al. (1995) isolated 2 cDNAs that differed in
their first exons, which they called E1-alpha and E1-beta. E1-alpha
encodes the first 43 amino acids of the p16 protein. E1-beta is utilized
by a second open reading frame that encodes a protein of at least 180
amino acids, in a different reading frame relative to p16. This protein
was designated p14(ARF) (alternative reading frame). Stone et al. (1995)
also cloned 2 p16 cDNAs from mouse. The mouse and human p16 proteins
share 60% identity, but the p14(ARF) proteins share only 28% identity.
Northern blot analysis detected different ratios of both transcripts in
all human tissues examined. The ratio of the 2 variants changed
dramatically through the cell cycle in human peripheral blood
lymphocytes. As stimulated T cells entered the cell cycle, the ratio of
beta-to-alpha splice variants increased.

Stott et al. (1998) stated that the alpha transcript of CDKN2A encodes
p16(INK4a), a recognized tumor suppressor that induces a G1 cell cycle
arrest by inhibiting the phosphorylation of the Rb protein by the
cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. The beta transcript of CDKN2A
encodes p14(ARF). The predicted 132-amino acid p14(ARF) is shorter than
the corresponding mouse protein, p19(ARF), and the 2 proteins share only
50% identity. However, both proteins have the ability to elicit a p53
(191170) response, manifest in the increased expression of both CDKN1A
(116899), also called CIP1, and MDM2 (164785), and resulting in a
distinctive cell cycle arrest in both the G1 and G2/M phases.

Robertson and Jones (1999) detected a theretofore unrecognized splice
variant of INK4a, termed p12, that arises through use of an alternative
splice donor site within intron 1. The p12 transcript produced a 12-kD
protein composed of INK4a exon 1-alpha and a novel intron-derived C
terminus. p12 contains only 1.5 of the 4 ankyrin repeats found in
p16(INK4A). Robertson and Jones (1999) showed that p12 did not interact
with CDK4, but its overexpression suppressed growth in cultured human
cervical carcinoma or pancreatic cell lines. Northern blot analysis
detected p12 transcripts in pancreas only.

Lin et al. (2007) stated that p16(INK4A) contains 156 amino acids and
has a calculated molecular mass of 16.5 kD. By RT-PCR of a human
neuroblastoma cell line, they cloned a splice variant of p16(INK4A),
p16-gamma. The transcript includes a 197-bp cryptic exon (exon 2-gamma)
from intron 2 that is spliced in-frame with p16(INK4A) exons 2 and 3.
The stop codon for p16-gamma lies within exon 2-gamma. The deduced
p16-gamma protein contains 167 amino acids and has a calculated
molecular mass of 17.9 kD. The first 152 amino acids of p16(INK4A) and
p16-gamma are identical. Biophysical analysis indicated that p16-gamma,
like p16(INK4A), is an ankyrin repeat protein. Lin et al. (2007) stated
that p14(ARF) does not contain ankyrin repeats. RT-PCR detected
p16-gamma transcripts in primary T-cell and B-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia patient samples and in other p16(INK4A)-expressing tumor
samples. Lower levels were detected in normal mononuclear cells and
non-tumor tissues.

Using RT-PCR, Burdon et al. (2011) demonstrated expression of CDKN2A in
human ocular tissues, including in the iris, ciliary body, retina, and
optic nerve.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kamb et al. (1994) stated that the CDKN2 gene consists of 3 coding
exons: exon 1 (E1), containing 125 basepairs; E2, containing 307
basepairs; and E3, containing just 12 basepairs.

Stone et al. (1995) determined that the CDKN2A gene spans 30 kb. Exon
E1-beta is the most 5-prime of the p16 exons. Lin et al. (2007)
identified an alternatively spliced exon, called 2-gamma, between exon
E1-alpha and exon 2 of the CDKN2A gene.

Quelle et al. (1995) found that in mouse, as in human, the INK4 locus
gives rise to 2 distinct transcripts from different promoters. Each
transcript has a specific 5-prime exon, E1-alpha or E1-beta, which is
spliced into common exons E2 and E3. The E1-alpha-containing transcript
encodes p16(INK4a) and the E1-beta-containing transcript encodes
p19(ARF) from a different AUG initiated in the E1-beta exon. Both
p19(ARF) and p16(INK4a) induced growth arrest in mammalian fibroblasts.

MAPPING

The p16 gene (CDKN2A) was mapped to 9p21 (Kamb et al., 1994; Nobori et
al., 1994). This same region has frequently been involved in deletions
and rearrangements in dysplastic nevi (Cowan et al., 1988), a major
precursor lesion of melanoma, and in cutaneous malignant melanoma, or
CMM (Fountain et al., 1992), and was shown by Petty et al. (1993) to be
involved in a constitutional deletion in a patient with multiple primary
melanomas. A locus for familial malignant melanoma, symbolized CMM2
(155601), has been mapped to 9p21. Kamb et al. (1994) noted that
chromosome region 9p21 is involved in chromosomal inversions,
translocations, heterozygous deletions, and homozygous deletions in a
variety of malignant cell lines including those from glioma, nonsmall
cell lung cancer, leukemia, and melanoma. Deletion of 9p21 markers is
found in more than half of all melanoma cell lines. These findings
suggested to Kamb et al. (1994) that 9p21 contains a tumor suppressor
locus that may be involved in the genesis of several tumor types.

Quelle et al. (1995) mapped the p16(INK4a) and p15(INK4b) genes to
position C3-C6 on mouse chromosome 4 in a region syntenic with human
chromosome 9p.

GENE FUNCTION

Kamb et al. (1994) found that MTS1 was homozygously deleted at high
frequency in cell lines derived from tumors of lung, breast, brain,
bone, skin, bladder, kidney, ovary, and lymphocyte. Melanoma cell lines
carried at least one copy of MTS1 in combination with a deleted allele.
Melanoma cell lines that carried at least 1 copy of MTS1 frequently
showed nonsense, missense, or frameshift mutations in the gene. Thus,
MTS1 may rival p53 (191170) in the universality of its involvement in
tumorigenesis. Furthermore, it illustrates, as does p53, the
relationship between the tumor suppressor genes and the regulation of
the cell cycle.

Quelle et al. (1995) showed that the protein p19(ARF) arises in major
part from an alternative reading frame of the mouse INK4a gene, and that
its ectopic expression in the nucleus of rodent fibroblasts induces G1
and G2 phase arrest. The authors noted that economical reutilization of
coding sequences in this manner is practically without precedent in
mammalian genomes, and they speculated that the unitary inheritance of
p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) may underlie their dual requirement in cell
cycle control. A somewhat similar situation was reported by Labarriere
et al. (1995) who found that transcripts originating from a novel
promoter in the human growth hormone gene GH1 (139250) have the
potential to specify a 107-amino acid protein, the C-terminal half of
which arises from a second reading frame in GH exons 1 and 2. Antibodies
to the C terminus of this predicted polypeptide histochemically stained
a subpopulation of pituitary cells, arguing for limited focal
translation of this mRNA.

The frequent deletion or mutation of CDKN2A in tumor cells suggests that
p16 acts as a tumor suppressor. Lukas et al. (1995) showed that wildtype
p16 arrests normal diploid cells in late G1, whereas a tumor-associated
mutant of p16 does not. Significantly, the ability of p16 to induce cell
cycle arrest was lost in cells lacking functional RB1 protein (614041).
Thus, loss of p16, overexpression of D-cyclins, and loss of
retinoblastoma have similar effects on G1 progression, and may represent
a common pathway to tumorigenesis. The mutation used by Lukas et al.
(1995) in their studies was a C-to-T transition changing proline-114 to
leucine and had been observed in 3 independent melanoma cell lines. Koh
et al. (1995) reported similar results. They demonstrated that p16 can
act as a potent and specific inhibitor of progression through the G1
phase of the cell cycle and that several tumor-derived alleles of p16
encode functionally compromised proteins. In vivo, the presence of
functional retinoblastoma protein appeared to be necessary but may not
be sufficient to confer full sensitivity to p16-mediated growth arrest.
In addition to the P114L allele, they used an asp74-to-asn (D74N)
mutant, a de novo somatic mutation isolated independently from tumors of
the esophagus and bladder; an asp84-to-asn (D84N) mutation found in a
survey of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas; and several other
mutations associated with melanoma.

Using amplification of polyadenylated mRNA by PCR, Quelle et al. (1995)
observed no expression of mouse p16 in many normal tissues, whereas p15
was expressed ubiquitously.

By immunohistochemical analysis of archival paraffin specimens and tumor
cell lines, Kratzke et al. (1995) found that p16(INK4) was expressed in
a nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line but not in 12 of 12 primary
thoracic mesotheliomas (156240) and 15 of 15 mesothelioma cell lines.
All tumor specimens and the tumor cell lines showed expression of
wildtype retinoblastoma protein. In addition, transfection of CDKN2
suppressed the growth of 2 independent mesothelioma cell lines. The
authors concluded that inactivation of the CDKN2 gene is an essential
step in the etiology of malignant mesotheliomas.

Serrano et al. (1996) proposed that the absence of p16(INK4a)
contributes significantly to the tumor susceptibility phenotype. Kamijo
et al. (1997) used a conventional targeting vector to ablate the mouse
p19(ARF) exon 1b in mouse embryonic stem cells, replacing it with a
neomycin-resistant gene. The expression of the p16(INK4a) gene was not
abolished. Mice lacking p19(ARF) but expressing functional p16(INK4a)
developed tumors early in life. Their embryo fibroblasts did not senesce
and were transformed by oncogenic Ha-ras alone. Conversion of
p16(ARF)+/+ or p16(ARF)+/- mouse embryo fibroblasts to continuously
proliferating cell lines involved loss of either p19(ARF) or p53.
Checkpoint control mediated by p53 was unperturbed in p19(ARF)-null
fibroblasts, whereas p53-negative cell lines were resistant to
p19(ARF)-induced growth arrest. Kamijo et al. (1997) concluded that
INK4a encodes growth inhibitory proteins that act upstream of the
retinoblastoma protein and p53. They suggested that mutations and
deletions targeting this locus in cancer cells are unlikely to be
functionally equivalent.

Splicing of alternative first exons (1-alpha vs 1-beta) to a common
second exon within the INK4A gene generates mRNAs in which exon 2
sequences are translated in 2 different reading frames. One of the
products, the cyclin D-dependent kinase inhibitor p16, is functionally
inactivated by mutations or deletions in a wide variety of cancers;
however, because many such mutations occur in exon 2, they also affect
the alternative reading frame (ARF) protein. To determine whether such
mutations disrupt p19(ARF) function, Quelle et al. (1997) introduced
naturally occurring missense mutations into mouse Ink4a exon 2 sequences
and tested mutant p16 and p19 proteins for their ability to inhibit cell
cycle progression. Six p19(ARF) point mutants remained fully active in
mediating cell cycle arrest in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, whereas 2 of the
corresponding mutations within p16 resulted in complete loss of
activity. Analysis of p19(ARF) deletion mutants indicated that the
unique N-terminal domain encoded by exon 1-beta was both necessary and
sufficient for inducing cell cycle G1 arrest. Therefore, they concluded
that cancer-associated mutations within exon 2 of the INK4A gene
specifically target p16 and not p19 for inactivation.

Zhang et al. (1998) stated that the 2 unrelated proteins encoded by the
INK4A-ARF locus function in tumor suppression. Zhang et al. (1998)
showed that ARF binds to MDM2 (164785) and promotes the rapid
degradation of MDM2. This interaction is mediated by the E1-beta-encoded
N-terminal domain of ARF and a C-terminal region of MDM2. ARF-promoted
MDM2 degradation is associated with MDM2 modification and concurrent p53
(191170) stabilization and accumulation. The functional consequence of
ARF-regulated p53 levels via MDM2 proteolysis is evidenced by the
ability of ectopically expressed ARF to restore a p53-imposed G1 cell
cycle arrest that is otherwise abrogated by MDM2. Thus, Zhang et al.
(1998) concluded that deletion of the ARF-INK4A locus simultaneously
impairs the INK4A--cyclin D/CDK4--RB and the ARF--MDM2--p53 pathways.

Pomerantz et al. (1998) showed that p19(ARF) potently suppresses
oncogenic transformation in primary cells and that this function is
abrogated when p53 is neutralized by viral oncoproteins and
dominant-negative mutants but not by the p53 antagonist MDM2. This
finding, coupled with the observations that p19(ARF) and MDM2 physically
interact and that p19(ARF) blocks MDM2-induced p53 degradation and
transactivational silencing, suggests that p19(ARF) functions to prevent
the neutralization of p53 by MDM2. Pomerantz et al. (1998) suggested
that INK4A has a potent tumor suppressor activity to the cooperative
actions of its 2 protein products and their relation to the 2 central
growth control pathways, Rb and p53.

Zhang and Xiong (1999) reported that the human ARF protein predominantly
localizes to the nucleolus via a sequence within the exon 2-encoded
C-terminal domain and is induced to leave the nucleolus by MDM2. ARF
forms nuclear bodies with MDM2 and p53 and blocks p53 and MDM2 nuclear
export. Tumor-associated mutations in exon 2 of the ARF-INK4a locus
disrupted the nucleolar localization of ARF and reduced its ability to
block p53 nuclear export and to stabilize p53. These results suggested
an ARF-regulated MDM2-dependent p53 stabilization and linked the human
tumor-associated mutations in the ARF-INK4a locus with a functional
alteration.

Vivo et al. (2001) performed coimmunoprecipitation and transfection
experiments demonstrating that the C-terminal region of spinophilin
(PPP1R9B; 603325) interacts with ARF in vitro and in mammalian cells.
Studies with deletion mutants showed that the first 65 amino acids in
the N terminus of ARF are necessary for this interaction. Ectopic
expression in different human and mouse cell lines showed that
spinophilin reduced the number of G418-resistant colonies with an
efficiency similar to or higher than that of ARF; this effect was
independent of the status of p53, Rb, and ARF. Coexpression of
ARF/spinophilin in Saos-2 cells suggested synergistic activity.

The p16(INK4A) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor is implicated in
replicative senescence, the state of permanent growth arrest provoked by
cumulative cell divisions or as a response to constitutive Ras-Raf-MEK
signaling in somatic cells. Ohtani et al. (2001) demonstrated a role for
the ETS1 (164720) and ETS2 (164740) transcription factors in regulating
the expression of p16(INK4A) in these different contexts based on their
ability to activate the p16(INK4A) promoter through an ETS binding site
and their patterns of expression during the life span of human diploid
fibroblasts. The induction of p16(INK4A) by ETS2, which is abundant in
young human diploid fibroblasts, is potentiated by signaling through the
Ras-Raf-MEK kinase cascade and inhibited by a direct interaction with
the helix-loop-helix protein ID1 (600349). In senescent cells, where the
ETS2 levels and MEK signaling decline, the marked increase in p16(INK4A)
expression is consistent with the reciprocal reduction of ID1 and
accumulation of ETS1.

Linggi et al. (2002) demonstrated that p14(ARF) is a direct
transcriptional target of the AML1-ETO (133435) fusion gene that results
from the t(8;21) translocation associated with acute leukemia.
Repression of p14(ARF) may explain why p53 is not mutated in
t(8;21)-containing leukemias and suggests that p14(ARF) is an important
tumor suppressor in a large number of human leukemias.

In mouse embryo fibroblasts, Qi et al. (2004) showed that p19(Arf) can
inhibit c-Myc (190080) by a unique and direct mechanism that is
independent of p53. When c-Myc increased, p19(Arf) bound with c-Myc and
dramatically blocked c-Myc's ability to activate transcription and
induce hyperproliferation and transformation. In contrast, c-Myc's
ability to repress transcription was unaffected by p19(Arf), and
c-Myc-mediated apoptosis was enhanced. These differential effects of
p19(Arf) on c-Myc function suggested that separate molecular mechanisms
mediate c-Myc-induced hyperproliferation and apoptosis. This direct
feedback mechanism represents a p53-independent checkpoint to prevent
c-Myc-mediated tumorigenesis.

Gonzalez et al. (2006) identified a putative DNA replication origin at
the INK4/ARF locus that assembles a multiprotein complex containing CDC6
(602627), ORC2 (601182), and minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCMs),
and that coincide with a conserved noncoding DNA element, regulatory
domain RD(INK4/ARF). Targeted and localized RNA interference-induced
heterochromatinization of RD(INK4/ARF) resulted in transcriptional
repression of the locus, revealing that RD(INK4/ARF) is a relevant
transcriptional regulatory element. CDC6 is overexpressed in human
cancers, where it might have roles in addition to DNA replication.
Gonzalez et al. (2006) found that high levels of CDC6 resulted in
RD(INK4/ARF)-dependent transcriptional repression, recruitment of
histone deacetylases, and heterochromatinization of the INK4/ARF locus,
and a concomitant decrease in the expression of the 3 tumor suppressors
encoded by this locus. Gonzalez et al. (2006) suggested that this
mechanism is reminiscent of the silencing of the mating-type HM loci in
yeast by replication factors. Consistent with its ability to repress the
INK4/ARF locus, CDC6 had cellular immortalization activity and
neoplastic transformation capacity in cooperation with oncogenic Ras
(see 190020). Furthermore, human lung carcinomas with high levels of
CDC6 were associated with low levels of p16(INK4a). Gonzalez et al.
(2006) concluded that aberrant expression of CDC6 is oncogenic by
directly repressing the INK4/ARF locus through the RD(INK4/ARF) element.

Reef et al. (2006) identified mouse and human smARF, a short
mitochondrial form of p19(ARF) that results from initiation of
translation at met45 in mice and met48 in humans. smARF lacks the
N-terminal nucleolar localization signal and several functional domains
of p19(ARF) and represents a small fraction of total p19(ARF) in vivo.
Mouse smARF localized to mitochondria and caused dissipation of
mitochondrial membrane potential independent of p53 (191170) and Bcl2
(151430) family members without releasing cytochrome c. Overexpression
of smARF led to induction of massive autophagy and to
caspase-independent cell death.

Janzen et al. (2006) reported that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
p16(INK4a), the level of which increases in other cell types with age,
accumulates and modulates specific age-associated hematopoietic stem
cell functions. Notably, in the absence of p16(INK4a), hematopoietic
stem cell repopulating defects and apoptosis were mitigated, improving
the stress tolerance of cells and the survival of animals in successive
transplants, a stem cell-autonomous tissue regeneration model. Janzen et
al. (2006) suggested that inhibition of p16(INK4a) may ameliorate the
physiologic impact of aging on stem cells and thereby improve injury
repair in aged tissue.

Molofsky et al. (2006) showed that progenitor proliferation in the
subventricular zone and neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb, as well as
multipotent progenitor frequency and self-renewal potential, all decline
with age in the mouse forebrain. These declines in progenitor frequency
and function correlate with increased expression of p16(INK4a), which
encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor linked to senescence. Aging
p16(INK4a)-deficient mice showed a significantly smaller decline in
subventricular zone proliferation, olfactory bulb neurogenesis, and the
frequency and self-renewal potential of multipotent progenitors.
p16(INK4a) deficiency did not detectably affect progenitor function in
the dentate gyrus or enteric nervous system, indicating regional
differences in the response of neural progenitors to increased
p16(INK4a) expression during aging. Molofsky et al. (2006) concluded
that declining subventricular zone progenitor function and olfactory
bulb neurogenesis during aging are caused partly by increasing
p16(INK4a) expression.

Krishnamurthy et al. (2006) showed that p16(INK4a) constrains islet
proliferation and regeneration in an age-dependent manner. Expression of
the p16(INK4a) transcript is enriched in purified islets compared with
the exocrine pancreas, and islet-specific expression of p16(INK4a), but
not other cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, increases markedly with
aging. To determine the physiologic significance of p16(INK4a)
accumulation on islet function, Krishnamurthy et al. (2006) assessed the
impact of p16(INK4a) deficiency and overexpression with increasing age
and in the regenerative response after exposure to a specific islet
beta-cell toxin. Transgenic mice that overexpress p16(INK4a) to a degree
seen with aging demonstrated decreased islet proliferation. Similarly,
islet proliferation was unaffected by p16(INK4a) deficiency in young
mice, but was relatively increased in p16(INK4a)-deficient old mice.
Survival after toxin-mediated ablation of beta-cells, which requires
islet proliferation, declined with advancing age; however, mice lacking
p16(INK4a) demonstrated enhanced islet proliferation and survival after
beta-cell ablation. Krishnamurthy et al. (2006) concluded that these
genetic data supported the view that an age-induced increase of
p16(INK4a) expression limits the regenerative capacity of beta-cells
with aging.

Lin et al. (2007) showed that human p16-gamma interacts with CDK4 and
inhibited its kinase activity. Using a reporter gene assay, transfection
of p16-gamma repressed the E2F response (see E2F1, 189971), the
downstream target of RB1, with an efficacy equivalent to that of
p16(INK4A). Moreover, p16-gamma, like p16(INK4A), induced cell cycle
arrest at G0/G1, and inhibited cell growth in a human osteosarcoma cell
line in a colony formation assay.

Li et al. (2009) showed that the Ink4/Arf locus, comprising
Cdkn2a-Cdnk2b (600431), is completely silenced in induced pluripotent
stem (iPS) cells as well as in embryonic stem cells, acquiring the
epigenetic marks of a bivalent chromatin domain, and retaining the
ability to be reactivated after differentiation. Cell culture conditions
during reprogramming enhance the expression of the Ink4/Arf locus,
further highlighting the importance of silencing the locus to allow
proliferation and reprogramming. Indeed, Oct4 (164177), Klf4 (602253),
and Sox2 (184429) together repress the Ink4/Arf locus soon after their
expression and concomitant with the appearance of the first molecular
markers of 'stemness.' This downregulation also occurs in cells carrying
the oncoprotein simian virus-40 'large-T' antigen, which functionally
inactivates the pathways regulated by the Ink4/Arf locus, thus
indicating that the silencing of the locus is intrinsic to reprogramming
and not the result of a selective process. Genetic inhibition of the
Ink4/Arf locus has a profound positive effect on the efficiency of iPS
cell generation, increasing both the kinetics of reprogramming and the
number of emerging iPS cell colonies. In murine cells, Arf, rather than
Ink4a, is the main barrier to reprogramming by activation of p53 and p21
(CDKN1A; 116899) whereas in human fibroblasts, INK4a is more important
than ARF. Furthermore, organismal aging upregulates the Ink4/Arf locus
and, accordingly, reprogramming is less efficient in cells from old
organisms, but this defect can be rescued by inhibiting the locus with a
short hairpin RNA. Li et al. (2009) concluded that the silencing of
Ink4/Arf locus is rate-limiting for reprogramming, and its transient
inhibition may significantly improve the generation of iPS cells.

Utikal et al. (2009) noted that the reprogramming potential of primary
murine fibroblasts into iPS cells decreases after serial passaging and
the concomitant onset of senescence. They demonstrated that cells with
low endogenous p19(Arf) protein levels and immortal fibroblasts
deficient in components of the Arf-Trp53 pathway yield iPS cell colonies
with up to 3-fold faster kinetics and at a significantly higher
efficiency than wildtype cells, endowing almost every somatic cell with
the potential to form iPS cells. Notably, the acute genetic ablation of
p53 in cellular subpopulations that normally fail to reprogram rescues
their ability to produce iPS cells. The results of Utikal et al. (2009)
showed that the acquisition of immortality is a crucial and
rate-limiting step towards the establishment of a pluripotent state in
somatic cells and underscored the similarities between induced
pluripotency and tumorigenesis.

Chen et al. (2010) reported that ARF is very unstable in normal human
cells but that its degradation is inhibited in cancer cells. Through
biochemical purification, Chen et al. (2010) identified a specific
ubiquitin ligase for ARF and named it ULF (604506). ULF interacts with
ARF both in vitro and in vivo and promotes the lysine-independent
ubiquitylation and degradation of ARF. ULF knockdown stabilizes ARF in
normal human cells, triggering ARF-dependent p53-mediated growth arrest.
Moreover, nucleophosmin (NPM; 164040) and c-Myc (190080), both of which
are commonly overexpressed in cancer cells, are capable of abrogating
ULF-mediated ARF ubiquitylation through distinct mechanisms, and thereby
promote ARF stabilization in cancer cells. Chen et al. (2010) concluded
that their findings revealed the dynamic feature of the ARF-p53 pathway
and suggested that the transcription-independent mechanisms are
critically involved in ARF regulation during responses to oncogenic
stress.

Baker et al. (2011) used a biomarker for senescence, p16(Ink4a), to
design a novel transgene, INK-ATTAC, for inducible elimination of
p16(Ink4a)-positive senescent cells upon administration of a drug. Baker
et al. (2011) showed that in the BubR1 (602860) progeroid mouse
background, INK-ATTAC removes p16(Ink4a)-positive senescent cells upon
drug treatment. In tissues such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and
eye, in which p16(Ink4a) contributes to the acquisition of age-related
pathologies, lifelong removal of p16(Ink4a)-expressing cells delayed
onset of these phenotypes. Furthermore, late-life clearance attenuated
progression of already established age-related disorders. Baker et al.
(2011) concluded that cellular senescence is causally implicated in
generating age-related phenotypes and that removal of senescent cells
can prevent or delay tissue dysfunction and extend 'healthspan.'

Braumuller et al. (2013) showed that the combined action of the T
helper-1-cell cytokines IFN-gamma (IFNG; 147570) and tumor necrosis
factor (TNF; 191160) directly induces permanent growth arrest in
cancers. To safely separate senescence induced by tumor immunity from
oncogene-induced senescence, Braumuller et al. (2013) used a mouse model
in which the Simian virus-40 large T antigen (Tag) expressed under the
control of the rat insulin promoter creates tumors by attenuating p53
(191170)- and Rb (614041)-mediated cell cycle control. When combined,
Ifng and Tnf drive Tag-expressing cancers into senescence by inducing
permanent growth arrest in G1/G0, activation of p16Ink4a, and downstream
Rb hypophosphorylation at ser795. This cytokine-induced senescence
strictly requires Stat1 (600555) and Tnfr1 (TNFRSF1A; 191190) signaling
in addition to p16Ink4a. In vivo, Tag-specific T-helper-1 cells
permanently arrest Tag-expressing cancers by inducing Ifng- and
Tnfr1-dependent senescence. Conversely, Tnfr1-null Tag-expressing
cancers resist cytokine-induced senescence and grow aggressively, even
in Tnfr1-expressing hosts. Braumuller et al. (2013) concluded that as
IFNG and TNF induce senescence in numerous murine and human cancers,
this may be a general mechanism for arresting cancer progression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The p16 protein binds to CDK4 (123829) and inhibits the ability of CDK4
to interact with cyclin D and stimulate passage through the G1 phase of
the cell cycle (Serrano et al., 1993). Deletions or mutations in the p16
gene may affect the relative balance of functional p16 and cyclin D,
resulting in abnormal cell growth. Kamb et al. (1994) and Nobori et al.
(1994) observed a high frequency of p16 deletions and mutations in many
tumor cell lines, which supported the above model and suggested that p16
has a pivotal role in inhibiting the development of human cancers. On
the other hand, studies by Cairns et al. (1994), demonstrating a much
lower frequency of mutations in primary tumors, suggested that the high
frequency of p16 mutations observed in cell lines are in vitro artifacts
and not evidence of a major role of the gene in the development of a
wide variety of malignancies.

Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes by large deletions, intragenic
mutations, altered splicing and promoter mutations may not be the only
mechanism leading to tumorigenesis. Merlo et al. (1995) showed that
although LOH on 9p21 is one of the most frequent genetic alterations
identified in human cancer, point mutations of p16 on the other
chromosome are relatively rare. They showed that monosomic cell lines
with structurally unaltered p16 contained methylation of the 5-prime CpG
island of the p16 gene. This distinct methylation pattern was associated
with a complete transcriptional block that was reversible upon treatment
with 5-deoxyazacytidine. Moreover, de novo methylation of the 5-prime
CpG island of p16 was found in approximately 20% of different primary
neoplasms, but not in normal cells, potentially representing a common
pathway of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. Little
and Wainwright (1995) raised the possibility that the aberrant
methylation of p16 may reflect the activity of a p16-specific
'imprintor.' The isolation of a p16 imprintor gene would be an exciting
development in cancer biology. As tumorigenesis often apes embryology,
such an imprintor may be necessary to 'switch off' p16-driven inhibition
of cell proliferation during certain stages of development. The findings
of Merlo et al. (1995) suggested that gene-specific methylation is
another way to 'suppress the suppressors.' In their brief review, Little
and Wainwright (1995) speculated: 'If methylation of (the) p16 (gene) is
the driving force behind the tumour, could p16 be specifically
demethylated?'

Hinshelwood et al. (2009) investigated the temporal progression of DNA
methylation and histone remodeling in the p16(INK4A) CpG island in
primary human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) strains during selection,
as a model for early breast cancer. Gene silencing occurred prior to de
novo methylation and histone remodeling. An increase in DNA methylation
was associated with a rapid loss of both histone H3K27 trimethylation
and H3K9 acetylation and a gradual gain of H3K9 dimethylation.
Regional-specific 'seeding' methylation occurred early after
post-selection, and the de novo methylation pattern observed in HMECs
correlated with the apparent footprint of nucleosomes across the
p16(INK4A) CpG island. Hinshelwood et al. (2009) concluded that CDKN2A
gene silencing is a precursor to epigenetic suppression; subsequent de
novo methylation initially occurs in nucleosome-free regions across the
p16(INK4A) CpG island, and this is associated with a dynamic change in
histone modifications.

McKenzie et al. (2010) assessed the utility of different assays in
predicting functional effects of CDKN2A mutations. They evaluated 28
different mutations, including missense, truncating, and intragenic
deletions for binding affinity to CDK4 and CDK6, cell-cycle inhibitory
activity, and subcellular distribution. There were varying results, with
some mutant proteins showing features similar to wildtype, and others
causing disruption of normal function. Almost all mutant proteins showed
a decrease in binding to CDK4, and most showed altered subcellular
localization in a punctate or speckled pattern. McKenzie et al. (2010)
concluded that a combination of assays to determine CDK4 binding
affinity and assays to determine subcellular distribution in mammalian
cells can provide a rapid and accurate assessment of CDKN2A mutation
function. CDK6-binding activity, in silico analysis, and Ki67 (176741)
expression were not useful adjuncts.

- Role in Pancreatic Cancer

Caldas et al. (1994) concluded that the CDKN2A gene is frequently the
site of mutations causing pancreatic adenocarcinoma. They had noted a
high frequency of allelic loss at 9p, including 9p21, in cases of
pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This tumor characteristically generates an
intense host desmoplastic reaction, and primary tumor tissue contains a
high admixture of contaminating nonneoplastic inflammatory and stromal
cells. For this reason, and because of the difficulty in establishing
pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells in culture, Caldas et al. (1994) took
advantage of xenograft explants. The analysis of MTS1 in 27 xenografted
pancreatic carcinomas and 10 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines showed
homozygous deletions in 15 (41%) and sequence changes in 14 (38%).
Sequencing of MTS1 from primary tumors confirmed the mutations.
Coexistent inactivation of both MTS1 and p53 (191170) was common.
Bartsch et al. (1995) found somatic CDKN2 mutations in 11 of 32
pancreatic adenocarcinomas. One tumor appeared to have a homozygous
deletion of CDKN2.

Liu et al. (1995) found that exons 1 and 2 of the MTS1 gene were deleted
in 50% of pancreatic cancer cell lines. The region 9p22-p21, where the
MTS1 gene is located, had been observed to show frequent loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas.

Mutation in CDKN2A can cause a syndrome of pancreatic cancer and
melanoma (see 606719).

In a population-based study, Ghiorzo et al. (2012) identified CDKN2A
mutations in 13 (5.7%) of 225 Italian patients with pancreatic cancer.
Six patients carried the common G101W mutation (600160.0005), which was
the most common mutation. Among the 16 probands with a family history of
cancer, including pancreatic and melanoma, 5 (31%) were found to carry
CDKN2A mutations. The mutation frequency ranged from 20% in families
with 2 affected members to 50% in families with 3 affected members. The
findings suggested that CDKN2A is the main susceptibility gene in
Italian families with pancreatic cancer.

Harinck et al. (2012) identified CDKN2A mutations in 6 (21%) of 28
families ascertained for familial clustering of pancreatic cancer. Five
of the 6 families were of Caucasian origin and carried the same Dutch
founder Leiden mutation (19-bp del; 600160.0003). Four of the 5 families
with the Leiden mutation had members who developed melanoma. In the
fifth family, only pancreatic cancer segregated with mutation status. A
sixth family, of Indonesian origin, with only pancreatic cancer and no
melanoma carried a different heterozygous mutation in the CDKN2A gene
(600160.0022). Harinck et al. (2012) concluded that the CDKN2A gene
should be analyzed in families with pancreatic cancer, even if melanoma
is not present.

- Role in Esophageal and Gastric Cancers

Igaki et al. (1994) found homozygous deletion of p16 in 12 of 13
esophageal cancer cell lines and in 2 of 9 gastric cancer cell lines.
They also found that p16 gene loss, cyclin D1 (168461), and p53 gene
mutations occurred independently in these cell lines. They interpreted
these results as indicating that changes in the p16 gene are involved in
most esophageal cancers and play a critical role in the development of
this type of malignancy.

Liu et al. (1995) found that exons 1 and 2 of the MTS1 gene were deleted
in 67% of esophageal squamous cancer cell lines examined.

Serrano et al. (2000) analyzed gastrinomas from 44 patients for CDKN2A
gene mutations and correlated the results to the tumor's biologic
behavior, growth pattern, and aggressiveness. No gastrinomas had
mutations of exon 1 or exon 2 of CDKN2A, although polymorphisms were
found in 54%. No homozygous deletions were found. In 52% of the
gastrinomas, hypermethylation of a 5-prime CpG island of the CDKN2A
promoter was found. The presence or absence of methylation of the CDKN2A
gene did not correlate with clinical characteristics of the gastrinoma,
biologic behavior (gastrin release and basal or maximal acid output),
the presence or absence of known prognostic factors (tumor size,
gastrinoma location, lymph node metastases, liver metastases, and
curability), or growth pattern of the gastrinoma postresection. The
authors concluded that methylation of the CDKN2A gene is probably a
central process in the molecular pathogenesis of these tumors.

- Role in Leukemia

By Southern blot analysis, Ogawa et al. (1994) found that both alleles
of the CDK4 inhibitor gene were completely or partially deleted in human
leukemia cells derived from leukemia patients and from established cell
lines. Homozygous deletion was found in 14 of 37 (38%) cell lines and 4
of 72 (6%) samples from leukemia patients, including 45 with acute
myelocytic leukemia, 14 with acute lymphocytic leukemia, and 13 with
chronic myelocytic leukemia in blastic crisis. All 4 leukemia patients
with homozygous deletion of CDKN2A had acute lymphocytic leukemia; 2 of
them had no cytogenetic abnormality of chromosome 9. Hebert et al.
(1994) likewise found homozygous MTS1 deletions in 20 of 24 cases of
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; homozygous MTS1 deletions were
found in only 2 of 31 B-lineage cases (P less than 0.001). The deletions
involved MTS1 and MTS2 (CDKN2B; 600431) in most cases. In only 5 cases
(4 T and 1 B), deletions involving MTS1 spared the MTS2 gene.

Hemizygous deletions and rearrangements of 9p21 are among the most
frequent cytogenetic abnormalities detected in pediatric acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), occurring in approximately 10% of cases.
To determine if the p16(INK4a) locus and the tandemly linked p15(INK4b)
locus might be the target of these chromosomal lesions, Okuda et al.
(1995) analyzed both genes in primary clinical samples from 43 pediatric
ALL patients using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Southern blot analysis, and PCR. Deletion of the 2 genes was identified
in 18 of 20 cases with cytogenetically observed abnormalities of 9p and
in 5 of 23 cases with apparently normal chromosomes 9p, with the
majority containing biallelic deletions (16 homozygous and 7
hemizygous). Although most homozygous deletions involved both genes,
Southern blot analysis showed an interstitial deletion in a single case
that was confined to p16(INK4a), suggesting that p15(INK4b) was not the
critical target gene in this case. Sequence analysis of both genes in
all 7 cases with hemizygous deletions failed to show mutations within
the coding regions of the retained alleles.

Using data from a genomewide association study of 907 individuals with
childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 2,398 controls and with
validation in samples totaling 2,386 cases and 2,419 controls, Sherborne
et al. (2010) demonstrated that common variation at 9p21.3 (dbSNP
rs3731217, intron 1 of CDKN2A) influences acute lymphoblastic leukemia
risk with an odds ratio = 0.71, P = 3.01 x 10(-11), irrespective of cell
lineage.

- Role in Bladder Cancer

In a screen for deletions and sequence variants of p16 in 140 bladder
tumors and 16 bladder tumor cell lines, Williamson et al. (1995) found
homozygous deletion of p16 in 8 cell lines and small sequence variations
in 2. All 13 tumors with small defined deletions of 9p21, 18/31 (58%) of
tumors with monosomy 9, and 9/91 (10%) of tumors with no chromosome 9
LOH had homozygous deletion of p16. No tumor-specific sequence variants
were identified. Deletion mapping revealed a nested set of deletions
focused on p16. The p16 gene, but not the related adjacent p15 gene, was
involved in 6 deletions, and 1 tumor had an intragenic deletion of p16.
All other deletions involved both p16 and p15 (CDKN2B). Williamson et
al. (1995) concluded that p16 represents the major target for deletion
at 9p21 in bladder cancer. Cairns et al. (1995) likewise found that
homozygous deletions represent the predominant mechanism of inactivation
of 9p21 in bladder tumors and are present in other tumor types,
including breast and prostate cancer. Moreover, fine mapping of these
deletions implicated a 170-kb minimal region that includes p16 and
excludes p15. Of 285 bladder cancers studied, 177 (62%) had loss of 9p
material; of these, they found LOH in 51 and homozygous deletion in 126.

Tsutsumi et al. (1998) studied p16/p19 deletion and p16 promoter
methylation, as well as loss of 9p21 heterozygosity, in pure squamous
cell carcinomas (SCC) and in transitional cell carcinomas (TCC) with SCC
of the bladder. Homozygous deletion of p16/p19 was detected in 11 of 21
(52%) cases of pure SCC and in 3 of 10 (30%) cases of TCC with SCC.
Three cases of TCC with SCC had p16/p19 deletion, hypermethylation of
the p16 promoter, or loss of heterozygosity on 9p21 only in the SCC
components, suggesting that these molecular alterations occurred
preferentially in SCC. Interestingly, homozygous deletion of p16/p19 was
observed in squamous metaplasia from 5 of 11 (45%) bladder cancer
patients, showing that this change occurred in preneoplastic cells. On
the other hand, these deletions were not found in squamous metaplasias
from noncancerous patients. Tsutsumi et al. (1998) concluded that
p16/p19 deletion is associated with early carcinogenesis of SCC of the
bladder, and squamous metaplasia of the bladder cancer patient has
already sustained genetic changes found in cancer, and that genetic
mosaicism occurs in cases of TCC with SCC, with the SCC component
showing more frequent 9p21 alterations than the TCC component.

- Role in Cutaneous Melanoma

Kamb et al. (1994) found mutations or homozygous deletions in
approximately 75% of melanoma cell lines. Studying 18 familial melanoma
kindreds, Hussussian et al. (1994) identified 6 probable disease-related
mutations in the CDKN2A gene. Among families with sufficient linkage
data, the disease-related CDKN2A germline mutations were detected in
families linked to 9p21 and not in families linked to 1p36 (155600),
thus providing support for genetic heterogeneity for this disease.
Hussussian et al. (1994) admitted that the data did not provide
definitive proof that CDKN2A mutation or deletion is required for the
development of melanoma. Functional studies of the mutated p16 protein
and gene transfer experiments to determine the ability of wildtype and
mutant CDKN2A to suppress tumorigenicity in melanoma cells with
homozygous deletions of 9p21 were considered necessary to provide that
proof.

Ranade et al. (1995) described biochemical analyses of the missense
germline mutations and a single somatic mutation detected in the
melanoma families by Hussussian et al. (1994). The melanoma-related
mutants were impaired in their ability to inhibit the catalytic activity
of the cyclin D1/CDK4 (123829) and cyclin D1/CDK6 (603368) complexes in
vitro. The data of Ranade et al. (1995) were thought to provide a
biochemical rationale for the hypothesis that carriers of certain CDKN2
mutations are at increased risk of developing melanoma.

Kamb et al. (1994) concluded that either the majority of mutations in
the CDKN2A gene causing malignant melanoma fall outside the CDKN2A
coding sequence or that CDKN2A is not the chromosome 9p melanoma
susceptibility locus that they symbolized MLM. They screened the gene
(referred to as CDKN2) for mutations in 8 American and 5 Dutch families
in which linkage studies appeared to indicate mapping of a
susceptibility locus to 9p21. Sequence analysis of the 3 coding exons
and the adjacent splice junctions revealed only 3 heterozygous
nucleotide substitutions among the 8 American probands and none in the
Dutch probands. A population frequency analysis was then conducted in
unrelated individuals who had married into high risk cancer kindreds in
Utah. Two of the variants were not detected in a set of 100 normal
samples; the third was present in 6 out of 163 samples, suggesting that
it is a polymorphism present in roughly 4% of the Utah population. By
allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) experiments, Kamb et al. (1994)
sought the other 2 mutations in 30 affected individuals with a positive
family history for melanoma but with unknown linkage status, and in 66
affected individuals with unknown family history. No other occurrence of
the mutations was detected.

Wainwright (1994) referred to the uncertainty about the relationship of
familial melanoma and p16 as 'a hung jury.' He suggested that the
familial melanoma story 'contains a sobering, perhaps slightly
depressing lesson for those attempting to isolate genes which do not
show a fully penetrant, single locus inheritance' such as the hereditary
breast and ovarian cancer locus at chromosome 17q21 (113705).

Puig et al. (1995) analyzed 12 microsatellite markers on 9p in 54 CMM
tumors and paired normal tissues from the same subjects. In 46% of the
tumors, including 2 in situ CMMs, LOH was found at 9p. Only one tumor
was homozygously deleted for 9p markers. The smallest deleted region was
defined by 5 tumors and included markers D9S126 to D9S259. Loss of 8 or
more markers correlated significantly with a worse prognosis (P less
than 0.002). Among the primary tumors, 87.5% of those with large
deletions had a high risk of metastasis, as compared with only 18% of
those without deletions or with loss of fewer than 8 markers (P = less
than 0.001). It was not possible for Puig et al. (1995) to demonstrate
homozygous deletions of p16 in any of the CMM tumors. In 4 tumors, the
LOH for 9p markers did not involve p16. Thus, the data suggested the
existence of several tumor suppressor genes on 9p that are involved in
the predisposition to and/or progression of CMM and exclude p16 from
involvement in the early development of some melanoma tumors.

Liu et al. (1995) described a family with inherited melanoma in which a
novel mutation in exon 2 of the p16(INK4A) gene (600160.0004) segregated
with disease. The mutant allele encoded a protein with an in-frame
deletion of 2 amino acids (asp96 and leu97). They showed that the mutant
protein is functionally abnormal: it was unable to bind CDK4 in vitro
and did not inhibit colony formation in tertiary passage rat embryo
fibroblasts. Moreover, in a metastatic lesion from 1 patient, the
wildtype allele was deleted and the mutant allele retained. Liu et al.
(1995) concluded that family members carrying the germline mutation in
this gene are predisposed to melanoma.

Walker et al. (1995) found that in 7 of 18 Australian melanoma kindreds,
including the 6 largest, CDKN2 mutations segregated with the putative
melanoma chromosome previously assigned by 9p haplotype analysis. The
mutations included duplication of a 24-bp repeat, a deleted C residue
resulting in the introduction of a premature stop codon, and 4 single
basepair changes causing amino acid substitutions. Mutations segregated
to 46 of 51 affected persons in these 7 kindreds, with 3 apparent
sporadic cases in 1 family and 1 in each of another 2 families.
Penetrance was variable (55-100%) among the different mutations. These
data were presented as additional strong support that the CDKN2 gene is
the chromosome 9p21 familial melanoma locus.

FitzGerald et al. (1996) screened for germline mutations in p16 and in 2
other candidate melanoma genes, p19ARF and CDK4 (123829), in 33
consecutive patients treated for melanoma; these patients had at least 1
affected first- or second-degree relative (28 independent families).
Five independent, definitive p16 mutations were detected, including 1
nonsense, 1 disease-associated missense, and 3 small deletions. No
mutations were detected in CDK4. Disease-associated mutations in p19ARF,
whose transcript is derived in part from an alternative codon reading
frame from p16, were detected in patients who also had mutations
inactivating p16.

Dracopoli and Fountain (1996) reviewed the role of CDKN2 mutations in
cutaneous melanoma. They reported that there had been 7 independent
studies in which the CDKN2 gene was screened for germline mutations.
Germline mutations were found in 34 of 76 families. They emphasized that
CDKN2 mutations are only found in a subset of the 9p21-linked families
and postulated that failure to detect CDKN2 mutations in these
9p21-linked families may be due to problems of mutation detection by
SSCP analysis in a GC-rich region, failure to detect promoter mutations,
or genomic imprinting of CDKN2. Dracopoli and Fountain (1996) reviewed
the evidence for a second melanoma predisposing gene on 9p21 and for the
possible role in melanoma pathogenesis of the CDKN2B gene (600431),
which maps in close proximity to the CDKN2 gene. They noted that 14
different germline mutations of CDKN2 have been reported; these include
7 missense mutations, 1 nonsense mutation, 1 insertion, 4 deletions, and
a splice donor mutation. Dracopoli and Fountain (1996) stated that the
functional significance of the 7 missense mutations was hard to predict.
Using in vitro assays, they identified 3 mutants with greatly reduced
binding capacity for CDK4/cyclin D1 complexes and reduced inhibition of
RB phosphorylation. Based on comparative analysis of sporadic melanomas
and melanoma cell lines, Dracopoli and Fountain (1996) determined that
small homozygous deletions limited to a region surrounding the CDKN2
gene are approximately 5 to 6 times more common in melanoma cell lines
than in uncultured metastatic melanomas. They concluded that the growth
potential in culture of a melanoma cell without functional CDKN2 protein
is significantly higher than that of a melanoma cell with wildtype
CDKN2, and that mutation analysis based solely on analysis of tumor cell
lines should be viewed with caution.

In 27 UK families showing evidence of predisposition to melanoma,
Harland et al. (1997) sequenced all exons of CDKN2 and analyzed the CDK4
gene, which encodes the protein to which p16 binds, for mutations. Five
different germline mutations in CDKN2 were found in 6 families (e.g.,
600160.0007); 3 of them had previously been reported.

Monzon et al. (1998) used PCR, SSCP analysis, and direct DNA sequencing
to identify germline mutations in the CDKN2A gene in patients with
multiple primary melanomas who did not have family histories of the
disease. A quantitative yeast 2-hybrid assay was used to evaluate the
functional importance of the variants found. Of 33 patients with
multiple primary melanomas, 5 (15%) had germline mutations. These
included a 24-bp insertion at the 5-prime end of the coding sequence, 3
missense mutations, and a 2-bp deletion at nucleotide position 307-308,
resulting in a truncated CDKN2A protein. In 3 families, CDKN2A mutations
identical to those in the probands were found in other family members.
In 2 families with mutations, previously unknown family histories of
melanoma were uncovered.

Fargnoli et al. (1998) screened 10 familial melanoma kindreds for
germline mutations in the p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) genes, alternatively
spliced forms of the CDKN2A gene. They identified 4 independent germline
mutations in exon 1-alpha and exon 2 of the CDKN2A gene. No
disease-associated mutations in exon 1-beta of the p19(ARF) gene were
found. From this small study, it appeared that the p19(ARF) gene does
not play a role in melanoma susceptibility.

As noted earlier, Dracopoli and Fountain (1996) reviewed the evidence
for a second melanoma predisposing gene on 9p21. Puig et al. (1995)
found large 9p deletions in 25 of 54 primary and metastatic melanomas.
Surprisingly, 4 of those 25 deletions did not include p16 itself, but
were located more proximally. Furthermore, Wiest et al. (1997) observed
100% loss of heterozygosity in the 9p region in squamous cell carcinomas
of the lung. About half of these tumors were shown to be homozygous for
a microdeletion within the area of loss of heterozygosity. Those
microdeletions clustered approximately equally in 2 areas, one of which
included p16, whereas the other more proximal cluster could have
revealed the location of another tumor suppressor gene. Studying Dutch
families with familial atypical multiple mole-melanoma syndrome (FAMMM;
155600) with the founder mutation, a 19-bp deletion in exon 2 of the
CDKN2A gene, so-called p16-Leiden (600160.0003), van der Velden et al.
(1999) found a characteristic haplotype in those carriers of p16-Leiden
with melanoma, as opposed to those p16-Leiden persons without melanoma.
They interpreted this as indicating the location of a locus linked to
p16 which modifies melanoma risk in these families.

Solar ultraviolet radiation is the major environmental risk factor for
nevi. However, Zhu et al. (1999) performed a twin study to investigate
large differences among individuals living in a small geographic area
with uniformly high skin exposure. Nevi may be subclassified as raised
or flat. In the sample of Zhu et al. (1999), raised nevi were 27% of the
total, and the 2 kinds had a correlation of 0.33. Correlations for total
nevus count in 153 monozygotic and 199 dizygotic twin pairs were 0.94
and 0.60, respectively, a finding compatible with a very high degree of
genetic determination. The authors hypothesized that some of the genetic
variance might be due to variation in the CDKN2A gene. Analysis of
linkage to a highly polymorphic marker (D9S942), located close to
CDKN2A, detected quantitative trait loci (QTL) effects accounting for
27% of variance in total nevus count, rising to 33% if flat but not
raised moles were considered. Total heritability was higher for raised
(0.69) than for flat (0.42) moles, but QTL linkage was zero for raised
moles, whereas it accounted for 80% of the heritability of flat moles;
additionally, family environment accounted for only 15% of variance in
raised moles versus 46% in flat moles. These findings suggested that
raised and flat nevi have different etiologies. Longer alleles at D9S942
were associated with higher flat mole counts. Since germline mutations
in CDKN2A are rare, it was considered likely that variants in the
noncoding regions of this gene, or in another gene nearby, are
responsible for this major determinant of moles and, hence, of melanoma
risk.

In a genomewide study of nevus count using an expanded sample of twins
and their families, including 221 pairs of monozygotic twins, Zhu et al.
(2007) confirmed linkage to chromosome 9p21 with a maximum lod score of
3.42 after inclusion of fine mapping markers.

Bahuau et al. (1998) identified a germline deletion involving the CDKN2A
locus in familial proneness to melanoma and nervous system tumors.
Petronzelli et al. (2001) detected a novel splice site mutation in a
family with melanomas, neurofibromas, and multiple dysplastic nevi. Both
alternative mRNAs produced by the mutant allele lacked shared sequences
from exon 2, which encodes a substantial portion (more than 50%) of both
p16(INK4) and p14(ARF) proteins. They suggested that the development of
neurofibromas may be explained by cooperative effects of combined
inactivation of these 2 proteins or, alternatively, of p14(ARF) alone.

The melanoma-astrocytoma syndrome (155755) is characterized by a dual
predisposition to melanoma and neural system tumors, commonly
astrocytoma. Germline deletions of the region on 9p21 containing the
CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes and CDKN2A exon 1-beta have been reported in
kindreds, implicating contiguous tumor suppressor gene deletion as a
cause of this syndrome. Randerson-Moor et al. (2001) described a family
characterized by multiple melanoma and neural cell tumors segregating
with a germline deletion of the p14(ARF)-specific exon 1-beta of CDKN2A.
The deletion did not affect the coding or minimal promoter sequences of
either CDKN2A or CDKN2B. The authors hypothesized that the phenotype is
due to either loss of p14(ARF) function, rather than contiguous loss of
both CDKN2A and CDKN2B; or disruption of expression of p16.

Mutations in the CDKN2A gene are melanoma-predisposition alleles with
high penetrance, although they have low population frequencies. In
contrast, variants of the melanocortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R; 155555)
confer much lower melanoma risk but are common in European populations.
To test for possible modifier effects on melanoma risk, Box et al.
(2001) assessed 15 Australian CDKN2A mutation-carrying melanoma
pedigrees for MC1R genotype. A CDKN2A mutation in the presence of a
homozygous consensus MC1R genotype had a raw penetrance of 50%, with a
mean age at onset of 58.1 years. When an MC1R variant allele was also
present, the raw penetrance of the CDKN2A mutation increased to 84%,
with a mean age at onset of 37.8 years (P = 0.01). The presence of a
CDKN2A mutation gave a hazard ratio of 13.35, and a hazard ratio of 3.72
for MC1R variant alleles was also significant. The impact of MC1R
variants on risk of melanoma was mediated largely through the action of
3 common alleles, arg151 to cys (R151C; 155555.0004), arg160 to trp
(155555.0005), and asp294 to his (155555.0001), known to be associated
with red hair, fair skin, and skin sensitivity to ultraviolet light.

Van der Velden et al. (2001) found that the MC1R variant R151C modified
melanoma risk in Dutch families with melanoma. They concluded that the
R151C variant is overrepresented in patients with melanoma from families
with the p16-Leiden mutation (600160.0003). They suggested that the
R151C variant may be involved in melanoma tumorigenesis in a dual
manner, both as a determinant of fair skin and as a component in an
independent additional pathway, because the variant contributed to
increased melanoma risk even after statistical correction for its effect
on skin type.

In an analysis of 15 Italian melanoma families for germline mutations,
Della Torre et al. (2001) gained results supporting the view that
inactivating mutations of CDKN2A contribute to melanoma susceptibility
more than activating mutations of CDK4 and that other genetic factors
must be responsible for melanoma clustering in a high proportion of
families.

In North America, Europe, and Australasia, approximately 20% of familial
melanoma kindreds carry germline mutations in CDKN2A. There is also an
increased risk of pancreatic cancer in a subset of families with
mutation in this gene. Using published data, Goldstein (2004) found that
67 different CDKN2A mutations had been identified in 189 melanoma-prone
families. In 42 families with 18 different mutations, pancreatic cancer
had also been reported. Seventy percent of the mutations were observed
only once. Comparison of 147 melanoma-prone families without pancreatic
cancer to the 42 families that had pancreatic cancer reported showed no
significant differences in the types or locations of mutations.

Kannengiesser et al. (2009) identified 20 novel germline mutations in
the CDKN2A gene in patients with familial melanoma or multiple
melanomas. Segregation studies, in silico analysis, in vitro functional
studies showing loss of interaction with CDK4, and cell proliferation
assays indicated that 18 of the 20 variants had clear loss of function,
allowing them to be classified as pathogenic. All of the mutations
affected the p16(INK4) structure.

- Association with Diabetes

In genomewide association studies of type 2 diabetes (125853) involving
genotype data from a variety of international consortia, the Diabetes
Genetics Initiative of Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Lund
University, and Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (2007),
Zeggini et al. (2007), and Scott et al. (2007) detected association of a
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on chromosome 9, dbSNP rs10811661,
and diabetes susceptibility. This SNP is 125 kb upstream from
CDKN2A/CDKN2B, the nearest annotated genes. All-data metaanalyses
obtained genomewide significance (OR = 1.20, P = 7.8 x 10(-15)).

Helgadottir et al. (2008) replicated the association of the dbSNP
rs10811661 T allele to type 2 diabetes in Icelandic, Danish, and United
States case-control groups (OR = 1.29, P = 2.5 x 10(-10)).

- Role in Other Cancers

Although pituitary tumors develop at a high frequency in retinoblastoma
(Rb)-knockout mice, defects in the RB gene are not common in human
pituitary tumors. The inverse correlation of RB and p16 defects in
certain human tumors led Woloschak et al. (1996) to investigate the
expression of p16 in human pituitary tumors as an indirect mechanism of
RB inactivation. By Western blot analysis, the p16 gene product was
undetectable in 25 human pituitary tumors, whereas high levels of p16
could be demonstrated in 10 normal human pituitary specimens under the
same conditions of protein extraction and immunoblotting. Similar
results were obtained at the mRNA level. Quantitative PCR analysis
revealed diminished amplification of p16 relative to a control gene in 3
of 25 tumors, suggesting homozygous p16 gene loss. This altered
expression is not associated with frequent p16 mutation or gene loss,
suggesting to Woloschak et al. (1996) that alternative mechanisms of
gene inactivation and/or altered regulation occur in most of these
tumors.

Ohhara et al. (1996) examined the sequence and expression level of the
CDKN2A gene in primary colorectal carcinomas. Using RT-PCR, they
quantitatively detected the CDKN2A transcript in 14 of 17 tumors, but in
only one case of adjacent normal mucosa. Direct sequencing of the
amplified CDKN2A gene showed no somatic mutations in the 17 tumors
examined. The authors concluded that enhanced expression, rather than
inactivation of the CDKN2A gene, may be involved in the early stages of
the pathogenesis of primary colorectal carcinomas.

Pilon et al. (1999) investigated inactivation of the p16 tumor
suppressor gene in a series of 14 adrenocortical tumors. Using 11
polymorphic microsatellite markers spanning the short arm of chromosome
9, they demonstrated that 3 of 7 adrenocortical carcinomas and 1 of 7
adrenocortical adenomas had LOH within chromosome 9p21, the region
containing p16. Immunohistochemistry showed the absence of p16 nuclear
staining in all adrenocortical tumors with LOH within 9p21, and positive
staining in all remaining tumors without LOH. The authors concluded that
LOH within 9p21 associated with lack of p16 expression occurs in a
considerable proportion of adrenocortical malignant tumors but is rare
in adenomas. Furthermore, they suggested that inactivation of p16 may
contribute to the deregulation of cell proliferation in this neoplastic
disease.

Honoki et al. (2007) performed a metaanalysis of 6 studies representing
188 patients with Ewing sarcoma (612219). Presence of a p16(INK4a)
mutation was associated with a poor prognosis, as assessed by likelihood
of 2-year survival. The estimated pooled relative risk for p16(INK4a)
alteration for 2-year survival was statistically significant (2.17; 95%
confidence interval 1.55-3.03). There was no statistically significant
difference in the pooled estimated risk ratios of p16(INK4a) alteration
for disease outcome between patients with or without metastasis at
diagnosis.

In a study of patients with stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC;
see 211980) who underwent curative resection but had a recurrence
compared to matched patients who did not have a recurrence, Brock et al.
(2008) found that promoter methylation of the CDKN2A, CDH13 (601364),
RASSF1A (605082), and APC (611731) genes in tumors and in histologically
tumor-negative lymph nodes was independently associated with tumor
recurrence. Methylation of the promoter regions of CDKN2A and CDH13 in
both tumor and mediastinal lymph nodes was associated with an odds ratio
of recurrent cancer of 15.50 in the original cohort and an OR of 25.25
when the original cohort was combined with an independent validation
cohort of 20 patients with stage I NSCLC.

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
CDKN2A gene and glioma, see GLM5 (613030).

- Mutation Databases

Smith-Sorensen and Hovig (1996) reported a database with 146 point
mutations in the CDKN2A gene. They also summarized studies of the
biochemical and biologic functions of both wildtype and mutant proteins.

Murphy et al. (2004) described an online database describing both
germline and somatic variants of the CDKN2A tumor suppressor gene.

NOMENCLATURE

Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2A (CDKN2A) goes by the colloquial
designation p16, and is sometimes (e.g., Wainwright, 1994; Ranade et
al., 1995) referred to as p16(INK4). The gene was originally symbolized
MTS1 (for multiple tumor suppressor-1) by Kamb et al. (1994), who later
used the symbol CDKN2 because MTS1 had been preempted by the malignant
transformation suppression-1 gene (154280) located on 1p. See also
CDKN2B (600431).

ANIMAL MODEL

Krimpenfort et al. (2001) mutated mice specifically in the
Cdkn2a(p16-Ink4a) isoform, generating an allele called Ink4a. This
allele is silent in the p16(Arf) reading frame but introduces a stop
codon in the p16(Ink4a) transcript at conserved amino acid position 101,
resulting in deletion of the fourth ankyrin repeat motif. The analogous
human allele is a naturally occurring mutation found in a wide variety
of human tumor types and results in an unstable protein that is severely
defective in its ability to inhibit phosphorylation of RB1 and to induce
cell cycle arrest in transfected cells. Ink4a-homozygous mice do not
show a significant predisposition to spontaneous tumor formation within
17 months. Embryo fibroblasts derived from them proliferate normally,
are mortal, and are not transformed by oncogenic HRAS (190020). The very
mild phenotype of the Ink4a-homozygous mice implies that the very strong
phenotypes of the original Ink4a/Arf(delta-2,3) mice was primarily or
solely due to loss of Arf. However, mice that are deficient for Ink4a
and heterozygous for Arf spontaneously developed a wide spectrum of
tumors, including melanoma. Treatment of these mice with the carcinogen
7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) results in an increased incidence of
melanoma, with frequent metastases. Krimpenfort et al. (2001) concluded
that in the mouse, Ink4a is a tumor-suppressor gene that, when lost, can
recapitulate the tumor predisposition seen in humans. Sharpless et al.
(2001) generated p16(Ink4a)-specific knockout mice that retained normal
p19(Arf) function. Mice lacking p16(Ink4a) were born with expected
mendelian distribution and exhibited normal development except for
thymic hyperplasia. T cells deficient in p16(Ink4a) exhibited enhanced
mitogenic responsiveness, consistent with the established role of
p16(Ink4a) in constraining cellular proliferation. In contrast to mouse
embryo fibroblasts deficient in p19(Arf), p16(Ink4a)-null mouse embryo
fibroblasts possessed normal growth characteristics and remained
susceptible to RAS-induced senescence. Compared with wildtype mouse
embryo fibroblasts, p16(Ink4a)-null mouse embryo fibroblasts exhibited
an increased rate of immortalization, although this rate was less than
that observed previously for cells null for Ink4a/Arf, p19(Arf), or p53
(191170). Furthermore, p16(Ink4a) deficiency alone was associated with
an increased incidence in spontaneous and carcinogen-induced cancers.
Sharpless et al. (2001) concluded that p16(Ink4a) along with p19(Arf),
functions as a tumor suppressor in mice.

INK4A/ARF and p53 mutations promote tumorigenesis and drug resistance in
part by disabling apoptosis. Schmitt et al. (2002) showed that primary
murine lymphomas responded to chemotherapy by engaging a senescence
program controlled by p53 and p16(Ink4a). Hence, tumors with p53 or
Ink4a/Arf mutations, but not those lacking Arf alone, responded poorly
to cyclophosphamide therapy in vivo. Moreover, tumors harboring a Bcl2
(151430)-mediated apoptotic block underwent a drug-induced cytostasis
involving the accumulation of p53, p16(Ink4a), and senescence markers,
and typically acquired p53 or Ink4a mutations upon progression to a
terminal stage. Mice bearing tumors capable of drug-induced senescence
had a much better prognosis following chemotherapy than those harboring
tumors with senescence defects. Therefore, cellular senescence
contributes to treatment outcome in vivo.

Sugimoto et al. (2003) showed that p19(ARF) inhibits production of
ribosomal RNA, retarding processing of 47/45S and 32S precursors. These
effects correlated with but did not strictly depend upon inhibition of
rRNA biosynthesis or cell cycle arrest, were not mimicked by p53, and
required neither p53 nor MDM2. ARF mutants lacking conserved amino acid
residues 2 to 14 did not block rRNA synthesis and processing or inhibit
cell proliferation. The authors proposed that evolution may have linked
a primordial nucleolar ARF function to MDM2 and p53, creating a more
efficient checkpoint-signaling pathway for coordinating ribosomal
biogenesis and cell cycle progression.

The TRP53 and RB pathways are 2 of the principal pathways controlling
cell proliferation that have been identified in human and mouse cells.
The CDKN2A locus is involved in both pathways by virtue of encoding
p16(INK4a), a regulator of RB1 phosphorylation mediated by CDK4 and CDK6
(603368), and p19(ARF), a modulator of p53 degradation mediated by MDM2.
Mice deficient for both p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) are viable but highly
prone to tumors, succumbing to lymphomas and fibrosarcomas early in life
(Serrano et al., 1996). Lund et al. (2002) used large-scale insertional
mutagenesis to screen for loci that can participate in tumorigenesis in
collaboration with loss of the Cdkn2a gene in Cdkn2a -/- mice. They
infected such mice with Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV).
Insertional mutagenesis by the latent retrovirus was synergistic with
loss of Cdkn2a expression, as indicated by a marked acceleration in the
development of both myeloid and lymphoid tumors. Lund et al. (2002)
isolated 747 unique sequences flanking retroviral integration sites and
mapped them against the mouse genome sequence databases from Celera and
Ensembl. In addition to 17 insertions targeting gene loci known to be
cancer related, the authors identified 37 new common insertion sites, 8
of which encode components of signaling pathways that are involved in
cancer.

Tsai et al. (2002) demonstrated that loss of the Arf tumor suppressor
gene strongly accelerates intermediate lobe pituitary tumorigenesis in
Rb heterozygous mice. The effects in the pituitary were greater than
those conferred by loss of p53. Tsai et al. (2002) concluded that
inactivation of ARF acts more broadly than that of p53 in connecting
abrogation of the RB pathway to tumorigenesis.

Aslanian et al. (2004) found that in wildtype mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs), the Arf promoter was occupied by E2f3 but not by any
other E2f family members. In quiescent cells, this role was largely
fulfilled by the E2f3b isoform. E2f3 loss was sufficient to derepress
Arf, triggering activation of p53 (191170) and expression of p21(Cip1).
Thus, E2f3 is a key repressor of the p19(Arf)-p53 pathway in normal
cells. Consistent with this, Arf mutation suppressed the activation of
p53 and p21(Cip1) in E2f3-deficient MEFs. Arf loss also rescued the cell
cycle reentry defect of E2f3-null cells, which correlated with
restoration of appropriate activation of classic E2f-responsive genes.

In rodent models of aging, Krishnamurthy et al. (2004) found that
expression of p16(Ink4a) and Arf markedly increased in almost all
tissues with advancing age, whereas there was little or no change in the
expression of other related cell cycle inhibitors. The age-associated
increase in expression of p16(Ink4a) and Arf was attenuated in the
kidney, ovary, and heart by caloric restriction, and this decrease
correlated with diminished expression of an in vivo marker of senescence
as well as decreased pathology of those organs. Krishnamurthy et al.
(2004) suggested that expression of the INK4A/ARF tumor suppressor locus
is a robust biomarker, and possible effector, of mammalian aging.

To investigate the role of oncogenic signaling in p53-mediated
protection against cancer, Efeyan et al. (2006) used mice with 2
genetically engineered traits: one had no Arf allele, and the other had
a 'super' p53 allele, i.e., they carried a single additional transgenic
copy of the intact p53 gene. Efeyan et al. (2006) found that Arf-null
mice responded normally to DNA damage and that p53(super) mice showed
the same enhancement of apoptosis irrespective of whether ARF was
present or absent. However, Arf-null cells were unable to respond
effectively to oncogenic signaling and underwent neoplastic
transformation by oncogenes in vitro, irrespective of the presence or
absence of the p53(super) allele. Efeyan et al. (2006) found that
p53(super)/Arf-null mice succumbed to spontaneous tumors at the same
rate as wildtype p53/Arf-null mice, producing the same profile of
sarcomas, lymphomas, and histiocytic sarcomas. When they treated both
classes of mice with a DNA-damaging agent, the p53(super) mice with the
Arf-null allele did not benefit from the extra p53 allele. Efeyan et al.
(2006) concluded that oncogenic signaling is the critical event that
elicits p53-dependent protection, and that DNA damage stimulus is less
important.

Using the model developed by Christophorou et al. (2005) in which p53
status can be reversibly switched in vivo between functional and
inactive states, Christophorou et al. (2006) found that the p53-mediated
pathologic response to whole body irradiation, a prototypic genotoxic
carcinogen, is irrelevant for suppression of radiation-induced lymphoma.
In contrast, delaying the restoration of p53 function until the acute
radiation response subsided abrogated all of the radiation-induced
pathology yet preserved much of the protection from lymphoma.
Christophorou et al. (2006) found that such protection is absolutely
dependent on p19(ARF), a tumor suppressor induced not by DNA damage, but
by oncogenic disruption of the cell cycle.

Matheu et al. (2007) showed that genetically manipulated mice with
increased but otherwise normally regulated levels of Arf and p53
presented strong cancer resistance and had decreased levels of
aging-associated damage. Matheu et al. (2007) concluded that their
observations extended the protective role of Arf/p53 to aging, revealing
a previously unknown anti-aging mechanism and providing a rationale for
the coevolution of cancer resistance and longevity.

Because mice lacking the Arf tumor-suppressor gene develop eye disease
reminiscent of persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV; see
611308), Thornton et al. (2007) explored mechanisms by which Arf
promoted eye development and its absence caused a PHPV-like disease.
Chimeric mice were made by fusing wildtype and Arf -/- morulae. Newborn
chimeras had primary vitreous hyperplasia, evident as a retrolental
mass. The mass was usually present when the proportion of Arf -/- was
relatively high and absent when the Arf -/- proportion was low. Thornton
et al. (2007) concluded that in the mouse model, loss of Arf in only a
subset of cells caused a PHPV-like disease. The data indicated that both
cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous effects of Arf might contribute
to its role in vitreous development.

Krimpenfort et al. (2007) reported that mice deficient for all 3 open
reading frames encoded at the Cdkn2 locus (Cdkn2ab-null) are more
tumor-prone and develop a wider spectrum of tumors than Cdkn2a mutant
mice, with a preponderance of skin tumors and soft tissue sarcomas
(i.e., mesothelioma) frequently composed of mixed cell types and often
showing biphasic differentiation. Cdkn2ab-null mouse embryonic
fibroblasts were substantially more sensitive to oncogenic
transformation than Cdkn2a mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).
Under conditions of stress, p15(Ink4b) (600431) protein levels were
significantly elevated in MEFs deficient for p16(Ink4a). Krimpenfort et
al. (2007) concluded that p15(Ink4b) can fulfill a critical backup
function for p16(Ink4a) and suggested a model that provided an
explanation for the frequent loss of the complete CDKN2B-CDKN2A locus in
human tumors.

Bmi1 (164831) is necessary for the maintenance of adult hematopoietic
stem cells (HSCs) and neural stem cells. Akala et al. (2008)
demonstrated that bone marrow cells from mice with triple deletion of
p16(Ink4a), p19(Arf), and Trp53, all genetically downstream of Bmi1,
have an approximately 10-fold increase in cells able to reconstitute the
blood long term. This increase was associated with the acquisition of
long-term reconstitution capacity by cells of the phenotype
c-kit+Sca1+Flt3+CD150-CD48-Lin-, which defines multipotent progenitors
in wildtype mice. The pattern of triple mutant multipotent progenitor
response to growth factors resembled that of wildtype multipotent
progenitors but not wildtype HSCs. Akala et al. (2008) concluded that
p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf) and Trp53 have a central role in limiting the
expansion potential of multipotent progenitors. The authors commented
that these pathways are commonly repressed in cancer, suggesting a
mechanism by which early progenitor cells could gain the ability to
self-renew and become malignant with further oncogenic mutations.

Visel et al. (2010) showed that deletion of the 70-kb noncoding interval
on mouse chromosome 4 orthologous to the chromosome 9p21 interval
associated with human coronary artery disease (CAD) (see CHD8, 611139)
affects cardiac expression of neighboring genes, as well as
proliferation properties of vascular cells. Mice with homozygous
deletion of the 70-kb interval (delta-70-kb) were viable but showed
increased mortality both during development and as adults. Cardiac
expression of 2 genes near the noncoding interval, Cdkn2a and Cdkn2b
(600431), was severely reduced in delta-70-kb homozygous mice,
indicating that distant-acting gene regulatory functions are located in
the noncoding CAD risk interval. Allele-specific expression of Cdkn2b
transcripts in heterozygous mice showed that the deletion affects
expression through a cis-acting mechanism. Primary cultures of aortic
smooth muscle cells from homozygous delta-70-kb mice exhibited excessive
proliferation and diminished senescence, a cellular phenotype consistent
with accelerated CAD pathogenesis. Visel et al. (2010) concluded that,
taken together, their results provided direct evidence that the CAD risk
interval has a pivotal role in the regulation of cardiac CDKN2A/B
expression, and suggested that this region affects coronary artery
disease progression by altering the dynamics of vascular cell
proliferation.

Huang et al. (2011) demonstrated the direct induction of functional
hepatocyte-like (induced hepatocyte, iHep) cells from mouse tail-tip
fibroblasts by transduction of Gata4 (600576), Hnf1-alpha (142410), and
Foxa3 (602295) and inactivation of p19(Arf). iHep cells showed typical
epithelial morphology, expressed hepatic genes, and acquired hepatocyte
functions. Notably, transplanted iHep cells repopulated the livers of
fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase-deficient (Fah-null; see 613871) mice and
rescued almost half of recipients from death by restoring liver
functions.

Among the melanoma (155601) cell lines that carried at least 1 copy of

CDKN2A, 19-BP DEL, NT225

Gruis et al. (1995) analyzed CDKN2A coding sequences in 15 Dutch FAMMM
syndrome pedigrees, and identified a 19-bp germline deletion in 13 of
them. All 13 families originated from an endogamous population. The
deletion caused a reading-frame shift, predicted to result in a severely
truncated p16 protein. Homozygosity for the deletion was found in 2
family members, one of whom showed no obvious signs of melanoma. The
finding demonstrated that homozygotes for this CDKN2A mutation are
viable, and suggested the presence of a genetic mechanism that can
compensate for the functional loss of p16. The results strengthened the
notion that p16 is the molecular nature of the 9p21-linked form of
familial melanoma (CMM2; 155601). Of the 2 homozygous individuals, one
was fully examined at the age of 54 and showed as the only possible sign
of FAMMM 3 very mildly atypical nevi. Until her death from
adenocarcinoma (site not stated) at the age of 55, this subject remained
free of melanomas. The second homozygote, a nephew of the first, had a
very large number of atypical moles at the age of 11; at the age of 15,
an invasive melanoma was found.

(In addition to the 19-bp deletion of p16, which goes by the name of
Leiden, there is at least one familial hypercholesterolemia Leiden
(143890.0041), factor V Leiden (612309.0001), apoE3 Leiden
(107741.0006), and a hemoglobin Leiden (141900.0156).)

Van der Velden et al. (1999) hypothesized that a tentative second
tumor-related gene in 9p21 may also act as a modifier of melanoma risk
conveyed by known CDKN2A mutations. To identify genetic modifiers for a
known, 'primary' susceptibility gene, one would ideally need to study a
large number of carriers of a single mutation in that primary gene.
Dutch FAMMM families provided them with a unique opportunity for such
studies, since the 19-bp founder deletion in exon 2 of the CDKN2A gene,
p16-Leiden, segregated in most Dutch FAMMM families. The 36% cumulative
incidence for melanoma in p16-Leiden carriers illustrated a high
melanoma risk associated with this mutation but also suggested that
environmental and/or genetic factors act as risk modifiers. Van der
Velden et al. (1999) performed haplotype analysis for 9p21 using
microsatellite markers in 6 p16-Leiden families originating from a
founder population. In 2 families, p16-Leiden carriers shared an
unexpectedly large founder haplotype (approximately 20 cM) around
CDKN2A, mostly in the proximal direction. Melanoma-positive p16-Leiden
carriers from these families showed this extensive proximal haplotype,
compared with melanoma-negative p16-Leiden carriers from the same
families. Additional p16-Leiden families less heavily affected with
melanoma showed shorter haplotype sharing, excluding the region proximal
of CDKN2A. The presence of a gene involved in melanoma susceptibility
proximal to CDKN2A was corroborated by somatic deletions of 9p in
tumors, which frequently did not include CDKN2A but a more proximal
chromosomal region instead. The results provided a candidate region for
further gene mapping in p16-negative 9p21-linked melanoma families and
guided the search for risk modifiers in melanoma development.

Vasen et al. (2000) performed mutation analysis on 27 families with
FAMMM syndrome and identified the CDKN2A-Leiden mutation in 19 families.
They identified 86 patients with melanoma, and the second most frequent
cancer was pancreatic carcinoma, which was observed in 15 patients from
7 families. The mean age at diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma was 58
years, with a range from 38 to 77 years. Putative mutation carriers had
an estimated cumulative risk of 17% for developing pancreatic carcinoma
by age 75 years. In the 8 CDKN2A-Leiden-negative families, no cases of
pancreatic carcinoma had occurred. The authors concluded that
individuals with the CDKN2A-Leiden mutation show an enormous risk of
developing pancreatic cancer (see 606719).

Schneider-Stock et al. (2003) found the p16-Leiden mutation in
heterozygous state in the blood and all 3 tumors of a man who was
diagnosed at age 54 years with simultaneous development of 3 carcinomas
of the pharynx and oral cavity. The patient neither smoked more than 5
cigarettes daily nor abused alcohol. Both his parents and his only
sister died of cancer very early (the mother of gynecologic cancer, the
father of liver carcinoma, and the sister of leukemia).

Harinck et al. (2012) identified the Leiden mutation (225_243del) in 5
Dutch families ascertained for familial clustering of pancreatic cancer.
Four of the families with the Leiden mutation had members who developed
melanoma. In the fifth family, only pancreatic cancer segregated with
mutation status; no cases of melanoma were noted. Harinck et al. (2012)
concluded that the CDKN2A gene should be analyzed in families with
pancreatic cancer, even if melanoma is not present.

CDKN2A, GLY101TRP

In 3 families with melanoma (155601), Hussussian et al. (1994)
identified a gly93-to-trp mutation in the CDKN2A gene. (The GLY93TRP
mutation is now designated GLY101TRP.)

Whelan et al. (1995) described a kindred with an increased risk of
pancreatic cancers, melanomas, and possibly additional types of tumors
(see 606719) cosegregating with the gly93-to-trp CDKN2 mutation. Of
interest was the occurrence of squamous-cell carcinomas in this family,
a rare form, and squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue in the proband.
More than half of primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas have CDKN2
mutations (Mori et al., 1994). The mutation was identified by SSCP
analysis and was located in exon 2 where direct sequencing demonstrated
a G-to-T nucleotide change at position 295.

Ciotti et al. (1996) indicated that in a small geographic area of Italy
(possibly because of founder effect), they had detected the gly93-to-trp
mutation in 7 apparently unrelated families and in none of 50 control
persons. Nineteen cases of melanoma and 3 of dysplastic nevi were
diagnosed at ages ranging from 21 to 70 years in the kindreds with the
G93W mutation. In addition, 15 cancers at other sites were found in
these kindreds, including 3 pancreatic cancers but no gastric cancers.
The pancreatic tumors developed in members of 3 different families at
the ages of 48, 51, and 60 years.

Ciotti et al. (2000) stated that gly101-to-trp is the most common CDKN2A
missense mutation, having been reported in numerous families from around
the world, with a particularly high occurrence in France and Italy. They
examined the date of origin of the mutation and its migratory spread in
10 families from Italy, 4 families from the U.S., and 6 families from
France. In all families studied, the mutation appeared to have been
derived from a single ancestral haplotype. Using maximum likelihood
methods, they estimated that the mutation arose 97 generations ago,
providing some explanation for the wide geographic spread of this common
mutation, particularly in southwestern Europe. All of the Italian
families, with one exception, came from a small area on the eastern
coast of Liguria.

Auroy et al. (2001) found the G101W mutation in 7 patients with multiple
primary melanomas with no known melanoma cases within their families.
They stated that the mutation had already been described in more than 20
melanoma-prone families. They genotyped 8 microsatellite markers
flanking the CDKN2A gene and found, after allowing for recombination
over time, that haplotype sharing provided evidence for an original
G101W mutation common to 6 of the 7 sporadic multiple primary melanoma
cases.

In Italy, Mantelli et al. (2002) screened for CDKN2A mutations in
families with 2 melanoma patients, 1 of whom was younger than 50 years
at onset and the other complying with 1 of the following: being a
first-degree relative; having an additional relative with pancreatic
cancer; or having multiple primary melanomas. Mutations were found in 21
of the 62 families (34%) with a high prevalence of the G101W mutation
(18 of 21).

In in vitro functional studies in mammalian cells, McKenzie et al.
(2010) found that the G101W mutant protein had decreased binding to CDK4
(123829) (about 20% of wildtype). Cell cycle inhibitory activity was
similar to wildtype at 37 degrees Celsius, but was decreased at 40
degrees.

CDKN2A, 3-BP DUP, ARG105INS

In 10 melanoma (155601) kindreds from southern Sweden, Borg et al.
(1996) identified a novel germline mutation in 2 families, constituting
an in-frame 3-bp duplication at nucleotide 332 in exon 2. The mutation
resulted in an insertion of arg at codon 105, which interrupts the last
of the 4 ankyrin repeats of the p16 protein, motifs which have been
demonstrated as important in binding and inhibiting the activity of
cyclin D-dependent kinases 4 and 6 in cell cycle G1 phase regulation.
Other malignancies observed in gene carriers or obligate carriers
included cervical, breast, and pancreatic carcinomas, and a non-Hodgkin
lymphoma. Analysis of microsatellite markers adjacent to the p16 gene at
chromosomal region 9p21 in the 2 families with the mutation showed that
they shared a common haplotype, in keeping with a common ancestor.

By haplotype analysis, Hashemi et al. (2001) concluded that the mutation
arose 98 generations, or approximately 2,000 years, ago. Thus, the
mutation, which they designated 113insR, could be expected to have a
more widespread geographic distribution in regions of Europe and North
America with ancestral connections to Sweden. Alternatively, CDKN2A may
lie in a recombination hotspot region, as suggested by the finding of
many meiotic recombinations in a narrow region of approximately 1 cM on
9p21.

CDKN2A, MET53ILE

Harland et al. (1997) identified a met53-to-ile (M53I) mutation in the
CDKN2A gene in affected members of a family with melanoma (155601). They
showed that the protein expressed from this previously described
mutation did not bind to CDK4/CDK6 (see 123829), confirming its role as
a causal mutation in melanoma. Monzon et al. (1998) found the same
mutation in a patient with multiple melanomas who was thought to have no
family history of melanoma when first investigated.

Pollock et al. (1998) pointed out that the M53I mutation had been
described in 5 melanoma families from Australia and North America.
Haplotype analysis suggested that there may have been only 1 original
M53I mutation.

MacKie et al. (1998) identified this mutation in 4 U.K. melanoma
families and also in 1 patient with multiple primary melanomas and a
negative family history.

melanoma-prone families and was found to cosegregate with cases of
melanoma. MacKie et al. (1998) identified this mutation in a U.K.
melanoma family.

CDKN2A, 24-BP DUP

Pollock et al. (1998) identified 2 new melanoma (155601) kindreds that
carried a duplication of a 24-bp repeat present in the 5-prime region of
the CDKN2A gene. This brought to a total of 5 the number of melanoma
families described with this mutation; the 5 families were from 3
continents: Europe, North America, and Australasia. Previous families
were reported by Goldstein et al. (1995), Walker et al. (1995), and
Flores et al. (1997). This suggested to Pollock et al. (1998) that there
had been at least 3 independent 24-bp duplication events. The
duplication was hypothesized to have arisen due to an unequal
crossing-over between the two 24-bp repeats naturally present in the
wildtype sequence, possibly through polymerase slippage during
replication. Further evidence that this repeat region is unstable and
therefore prone to both meiotic and mitotic slippage was provided by the
identification of a somatic 24-bp deletion of 1 of these normally
occurring repeats in a prostate tumor (Komiya et al., 1995).

In in vitro functional expression studies in mammalian cells, McKenzie
et al. (2010) found that the 24-bp duplication mutant had slightly
decreased affinity for CDK4 (123829) (80% compared to wildtype), but
remained fully active in mediating cell cycle arrest. In addition, the
24-bp duplication showed normal subcellular localization.

CDKN2A, -34G-T

Though germline CDKN2A coding mutations cosegregated with melanoma
(155601) in 25 to 60% of families predisposed to the disease, there
remain a number of mutation-negative families that demonstrate linkage
of inherited melanoma to 9p21 markers (Hayward, 1996). Liu et al. (1999)
showed that a subset of these kindreds possesses a G-to-T transversion
at nucleotide -34 of CDKN2A, designated -34G-T. The mutation gives rise
to a novel AUG translation initiation codon that decreases translation
from the wildtype AUG. The -34G-T mutation was not seen in controls,
segregated with melanoma in families, and, on the basis of haplotyping
studies, appeared to have arisen from a common founder in the United
Kingdom. Liu et al. (1999) suggested that screening for mutations in the
promoter region of the CDKN2A gene should be useful in English (MacGeoch
et al., 1994), Australian (Holland et al., 1995), and other northern
European populations (Borg et al., 1996) in which a low incidence of
germline coding mutations of CDKN2A has been found in familial melanoma
cases.

4 Canadian families carrying this mutation. All 7 families had a
haplotype consistent with a common ancestor/founder. The mutation

Harland et al. (2001) reported that affected individuals in 6 of 90
English melanoma (155601) pedigrees screened carried a transition
(IVS2-105 A-G) deep in intron 2 of the CDKN2A gene. The mutation creates
a false GT splice donor site 105 bases 5-prime of exon 3 and results in
aberrant splicing of the mRNA. The authors proposed that this mutation
and others similar to it may account for a significant proportion of
9p21-linked melanoma pedigrees with no detectable mutations in the
coding region of CDKN2A.

CDKN2A, GLY122ARG

Hewitt et al. (2002) reported a family harboring a splice mutation in
exon 1-beta of the CDKN2A gene that resulted in ARF haploinsufficiency.
The mutation was observed in a mother and daughter with melanoma and a
sib of the mother with breast cancer. The mutation was a 334G-C
transversion in exon 1-beta, which predicts a gly122-to-arg
substitution. Its position at the 3-prime end of exon 1-beta raised the
possibility of interference with splicing. Analysis of the melanoma from
1 individual revealed a 62-bp deletion in exon 3 of the wildtype allele
and loss of the mutant allele; these somatic changes would affect both
CDKN2A and ARF. The authors suggested that concomitant inactivation of
both ARF and CDKN2A may be necessary for melanoma development and that
mutations in ARF and CDKN2A possibly confer different levels of
susceptibility to melanoma, with the former associated with lesser
predisposition.

A val59-to-gly mutation in the CDKN2A gene was found in 4 families
segregating cutaneous malignant melanoma (155601): an Israeli family of
Moroccan Jewish ancestry (Yakobson et al., 2001), 2 French families (1
of Tunisian Jewish ancestry and another without known Jewish roots)
(Soufir et al., 1998), and a Spanish family (Ruiz et al., 1999).
Yakobson et al. (2003) found that all but 1 of those affected in these
families were heterozygous for the mutation; 1 affected member of the
Israeli family was homozygous. Haplotype analysis indicated a single
ancestral founder. The mutation, which occurs in a hydrophobic region
with the second ankyrin repeat, impairs p16-INK4a function, as shown by
studies of protein-protein interactions and cell proliferation assays.

transition in the CDKN2A gene, resulting in a leu113-to-leu (L113L) and
a pro114-to-ser (P114S) substitution, respectively. All families were
from southeastern France, and haplotype analysis indicated a founder
effect. The sporadic patient had a high sun exposure history and
Parkinson disease (168600) and received treatment with levodopa. He
subsequently developed 22 primary melanomas, suggesting that levodopa
may have contributed to the lesions. Further testing of this individual
showed 2 pathogenic variants in the MC1R gene (see, e.g., R151C;

Goldstein et al. (2008) identified a gly89-to-asp (G89D) variant in the
CDKN2A gene that was associated with significantly increased risk for
cutaneous malignant melanoma (155601) in an Icelandic population. The
mutation results in a synonymous G143G change in the p14(ARF) protein.
The frequency of the G89D variant was 0.7 in melanoma patients compared
to 0.08 in controls. The association was strengthened when restricted to
invasive melanoma, present in 2% of patients (p = 0.0015). Relatives of
affected G89D carriers were at significantly increased risk of melanoma,
head and neck cancers, and pancreatic carcinoma compared to relatives of
other melanoma patients. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect.
The common ancestor was determined to be a female who lived in

609763	TITLE *609763 PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 4-KINASE, TYPE 2, ALPHA; PI4K2A
;;PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 4-KINASE, TYPE II;;
PI4KII;;
PI4KII-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphatidylinositolpolyphosphates (PtdInsPs) are centrally involved in
many biologic processes, ranging from cell growth and organization of
the actin cytoskeleton to endo- and exocytosis. PI4KII phosphorylates
PtdIns at the D-4 position, an essential step in the biosynthesis of
PtdInsPs (Barylko et al., 2001).

CLONING

Minogue et al. (2001) partially purified PI4KII from plasma membrane
rafts isolated from human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells. By peptide
sequencing, database analysis, and RT-PCR of A431 total RNA, they
obtained a full-length PI4KII cDNA. The deduced 479-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of about 54 kD. PI4KII has a kinase
domain and a leucine zipper, but no transmembrane sequence or acylation
motif. Northern blot analysis detected a 6.6-kb transcript in all
tissues examined. Expression was highest in kidney, brain, heart,
skeletal muscle, and placenta, and was lowest in colon, thymus, and
small intestine. Purified PI4KII had an apparent molecular mass of 52 kD
by SDS-PAGE.

Barylko et al. (2001) identified a cysteine-rich segment (CCPCC), a
potential palmitoylation site, in rat and human PI4KII.

By immunofluorescence localization, Wang et al. (2003) found that PI4KII
localized to the Golgi in transfected COS-7 cells.

Using microarray analysis, Li et al. (2010) found ubiquitous PI4K-alpha
expression, with higher levels in brain, kidney, stomach, and lung, and
lower levels in thyroid, dermis, breast, and fibrous tissue.

GENE FUNCTION

Minogue et al. (2001) assayed recombinant PI4KII expressed in bacteria
and found that it phosphorylated PtdIns, but not PtdIns3P, PtdIns4P, or
PtdIns5P. Like PI4KII purified from tissues, recombinant PI4KII was
activated by detergent and inhibited by adenosine.

Wang et al. (2003) found that overexpression of PI4KII in COS-7 cells
increased synthesis of PtdIns4P. Some cells overexpressing PI4KII had
scattered or no perinuclear Golgi. Knockdown of PI4KII by RNA
interference (RNAi) did not disrupt the Golgi, and some cells showed
expanded Golgi. RNAi reduced the Golgi level of PtdIns4P and blocked the
association between AP1 (see 607291) and the trans-Golgi network (TGN).
PI4KII RNAi had little effect on intra-Golgi trafficking, but it
inhibited TGN-to-plasma membrane export by 35%. Wang et al. (2003)
proposed that PI4KII generates PtdIns4P-rich domains within the Golgi
that specify docking of the AP1 coat machinery.

By screening a human kinase small interfering RNA library, Pan et al.
(2008) identified PI4KII-alpha and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate
5-kinase type I (PIP5KI; 603275) as required for Wnt3a (606359)-induced
LRP6 (603507) phosphorylation at ser1490 in mammalian cells and
confirmed that these kinases are important for Wnt signaling in Xenopus
embryos. Wnt3a stimulates the formation of phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphates through 'frizzled' (see 603408) and 'dishevelled' (see
601365), the latter of which directly interacted with and activated
PIP5KI. In turn, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphates regulated
phosphorylation of LRP6 at thr1479 and ser1490. Pan et al. (2008)
concluded that their study revealed a signaling mechanism for Wnt to
regulate LRP6 phosphorylation.

Li et al. (2010) found that PI4KII-alpha induced angiogenesis in mouse
and human cells via activation of a HER2 (ERBB2; 164870)-PI3K (see
PIK3CG; 601232)-ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948) signaling
cascade, resulting in upregulation of HIF1-alpha (HIF1A; 603348) and
HIF1-alpha-dependent upregulation of VEGF (see VEGFA; 192240) and iNOS
(NOS2A; 163730). Downregulation of PI4KII in HeLa cells via RNA
interference did not cause cell death, but it reduced tumor growth
following inoculation of nude mice. Li et al. (2010) concluded that
PI4KII-alpha can contribute to tumorigenesis via induction of blood
vessel formation under anoxic conditions.

Jovic et al. (2012) found that the PtdIns4P-synthesizing enzymes
PI4KII-alpha and PI4KIII-beta (PI4KB; 602758) had distinct and
sequential roles in the lysosomal delivery of beta-glucosidase (GBA;
606463) and its receptor, LIMP2 (602257). Activity of PI4KIII-beta at
the Golgi was required to drive exit of LIMP2 from the Golgi, whereas
PI4KII-alpha at the trans-Golgi network regulated sorting of LIMP2
toward the late endosome/lysosome compartment. Knockdown or inhibition
of PI3KIII-beta led to accumulation of LIMP2 at the Golgi compartment,
and knockdown of either LIMP2 or PI4KII-alpha increased beta-GC
secretion. Mutations in PI4KII-alpha that disrupted its association with
AP3 (see AP3B1; 603401) disrupted lysosomal LIMP2 targeting.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the PI4K2A gene to chromosome 10q24.2 based on an
alignment of the PI4K2A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AJ303098) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

610401	TITLE *610401 NETRIN 4; NTN4
;;BETA-NETRIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NTN4 belongs to a family of proteins related to laminins (see LAMA1,
150320) Koch et al. (2000).

CLONING

Koch et al. (2000) cloned mouse and human NTN4, which they designated
beta-netrin. The deduced 629-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal
domain similar to domain VI of laminin beta-chains, a central domain
similar to domain V of laminin beta-chains, and a C-terminal netrin C
domain. There are 2 N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis
detected highest expression in kidney, spleen, mammary gland, aorta,
heart, ovary, prostate, and fetal spleen. Little to no expression was
detected in other tissues examined. RT-PCR of mouse tissues detected
high expression in kidney, heart, and ovary. Beta-netrin was also
expressed in brain and retina. Examination of specific mouse brain
regions detected highest expression in olfactory bulb.
Immunofluorescence localization detected beta-netrin in the basement
membranes of a variety of rat tissues, and it appeared to be produced by
both the epithelium and mesenchyme. Unlike other netrins (see NTN1,
601614), Ntn4 was not expressed during the development of mouse spinal
cord.

By RACE of total brain mRNA, Zhang et al. (2004) cloned a splice variant
of human netrin-4 that differed in the first coding exon. The deduced
591-amino acid protein lacks the N-terminal signal sequence found in
full-length beta-netrin. Northern blot analysis of specific human brain
regions detected a 3.2-kb transcript highly expressed in cerebral
cortex, but not in other regions examined. Netrin-4 was widely expressed
in adult rat brain.

By immunohistochemical analysis, Larrieu-Lahargue et al. (2010) found
that netrin-4 was expressed in dorsal aorta, anterior cardinal vein, and
lymphatic progenitor cells of mice at embryonic day 10.5. In adult mice,
netrin-4 was expressed in intestinal villi and crypts, lymph nodes, and
skin. Netrin-4 was also expressed in human breast tumor lymphatic and
blood vessels.

GENE FUNCTION

Koch et al. (2000) demonstrated that beta-netrin increased both the
neurite length and the number of neurites extending from explant
cultures of rat olfactory bulb.

Larrieu-Lahargue et al. (2010) stated that netrin-4 regulates
angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. They found that netrin-4 induced
lymphangiogenesis in lymphatic dermal human microvascular endothelial
cells (HMVEC-dLys). Netrin-4 treatment of HMVEC-dLys cells led to
dose-dependent increases in cell proliferation, cell adhesion,
chemotactic activity, and tube formation, and it reduced serum
deprivation-induced cell death. Overexpression of netrin-4 led to
enhanced metastasis of human breast cancer cells following injection in
nude mice. In addition, Netrin-4 induced lymphatic leakiness when
overexpressed in mice. Netrin-4-induced cell proliferation was
accompanied by phosphorylation of ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1;
176948), AKT (see 164730), and S6 (RPS6; 180460) in a concentration- and
time-dependent manner. Netrin-4 activity was strongly inhibited by
inhibitors of both PI3 kinase (see 601232) and AKT. Netrin-4-induced
vascular permeability was accompanied by activation of the small GTPases
RHOA (ARHA; 165390) and RAC1 (602048), Src family kinases (see 190090),
and FAK (PTK2; 600758), as well as downregulation of tight junction
proteins (see 601009).

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2004) determined that the NTN4 gene contains 10 exons and
spans about 133 kb. The promoter region contains 2 TATA boxes, 7 CCAAT
sites, and binding sites for several transcription factors, including 8
MYT1 (600379), and 4 olfactory neuron-specific binding sites (see EBF,
164343).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

By transmission electron microscopy after rotary shadowing, Koch et al.
(2000) found that the overall length of purified recombinant NTN4 is
about 17 nanometers. The molecules appeared to associate to form dimers
and to a lesser extent higher order assemblies. Dimerization occurred
through antiparallel linear alignment of the V and C domains.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Koch et al. (2000) mapped the NTN4 gene to chromosome
12q22-q23.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mouse Nemo/Ikk-gamma (IKBKG; 300248) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen, Leonardi et al. (2000) cloned CIKS from a human liver cDNA
library. The deduced 574-amino acid protein contains a C-terminal
leucine zipper. Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues
indicated ubiquitous expression of a 2.5-kb transcript.

Li et al. (2000) cloned a cDNA encoding ACT1 from a cDNA library
constructed from embryonic kidney cells induced to display constitutive
activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011). The deduced
574-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 60 kD and
contains a helix-loop-helix domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain.
The helix-loop-helix domain shares 35% identity with the
helix-loop-helix domain of upstream stimulatory factor-1 (USF1; 191523).
Northern blot analysis detected highest expression in thymus, kidney,
and placenta, moderate expression in heart, skeletal muscle, colon,
liver, lung, and small intestine, and low expression in brain, spleen,
and peripheral blood leukocytes.

By screening thymus, skeletal muscle, and fetal liver cDNA libraries,
Morelli et al. (2000) identified 3 isoforms of ACT1 that they designated
C6ORF4, C6ORF5, and C6ORF6. C6ORF4 encodes a deduced 575-amino acid
protein. C6ORF5 and C6ORF6 result from the skipping of exon 2 and are
differentiated by use of alternate polyadenylation signals, yielding
identical proteins of 566 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected
5.0- and 2.5-kb transcripts in all tissues examined, with a weak 3.8-kb
transcript in heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Leonardi et al. (2000) verified the interaction between CIKS and
IKK-gamma by in vitro binding assays using recombinant proteins and by
coimmunoprecipitation of lysates of transfected HeLa cells or
untransfected Jurkat T-leukemic cells. IKK-alpha (CHUK; 600664) and
IKK-beta (IKBKB; 603258) also coimmunoprecipitated with CIKS. Using
truncation mutants, the authors localized the binding domain to the N
terminus of CIKS. HeLa cells transfected with increasing amounts of CIKS
showed dose-dependent activation of an Ig kappa-B luciferase reporter
plasmid, and the activation could be blocked by cotransfection with
IKK-gamma. Cotransfection of CIKS with kinase-deficient mutants of NIK
(MAP3K14; 604655), MEKK1 (MAP3K1: 600982), IKK-alpha, and IKK-beta
indicated that CIKS activates NFKB exclusively through an IKK-dependent
mechanism. Overexpressed CIKS also potently activated SAPK/JNK (MAPK8;
601158). Analysis of the binding activity of truncation mutants showed
that the C terminus of CIK is involved in SAPK/JNK activation, whereas
the N terminus is necessary and sufficient for kappa-B reporter
activation.

Using gel shift assays, Li et al. (2000) confirmed constitutive
activation of NFKB with transfection of ACT1 into human embryonic kidney
cells. They also found constitutive activation of JNK and IKK.
Disruption of the N-terminal helix-loop-helix domain of ACT1 completely
abolished the interaction between ACT1 and the IKK complex as well as
the activation of NFKB.

By mutation analysis, Pacifico et al. (2003) identified a sequence in
the 5-prime flanking region of human CIKS that was essential for basal
promoter activity in a canine kidney cell line. RT-PCR, Northern, and
Western blot analyses showed that various proinflammatory cytokines
upregulated CIKS expression in HeLa cells.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Qian et al. (2007) found that IL17
(603149) induced association of ACT1 with IL17RA (605461) in various
cell types. The ACT1-IL17RA interaction required the SEFIR domain of
IL17RA. Expression of Il17-dependent inflammation-related genes was
abolished in Act1-deficient mouse cells. Mice lacking Act1 had delayed
onset and lower severity of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, as
well as limited colitis. Qian et al. (2007) concluded that ACT1 is
essential for IL17-dependent signaling in autoimmune and inflammatory
disease.

GENE STRUCTURE

Morelli et al. (2000) determined that the ACT1 gene contains 10 exons
and spans more than 50 kb. They also identified C6UAS, which overlaps
exon 2 and is transcribed in the antisense orientation from the
complementary strand of C6ORF4. C6UAS has no apparent open reading
frame, but Morelli et al. (2000) provided experimental evidence that it
has a regulatory function and can behave as an antisense RNA in the
control of C6ORF4 translation.

Pacifico et al. (2003) mapped the CIKS transcription start site and
found that the 5-prime flanking region was TATA-less, but it had
initiator, GC, and CAAT boxes.

MAPPING

Morelli et al. (2000) identified ACT1 within an EST clone that maps to
chromosome 6q21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ellinghaus et al. (2010) and Huffmeier et al. (2010) independently
identified association of a coding single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),
dbSNP rs33980500 (607043.0001), in the TRAF3IP2 gene with psoriasis
susceptibility (PSORS13; 614070).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PSORIASIS SUSCEPTIBILITY 13
TRAF3IP2, ASP19ASN (dbSNP rs33980500)

In a case-control genomewide association study of psoriasis
susceptibility (PSORS13; 614070), Ellinghaus et al. (2010) identified a
coding SNP, dbSNP rs33980500, in exon 2 of the TRAF3IP2 gene. A C-to-T
transition results in substitution of asn for asp at codon 19 (D19N).
This SNP was significantly associated with risk for psoriasis vulgaris
(P = 1.24 x 10(-16)) and psoriatic arthritis (P = 4.57 x 10(-12)).

In an independent case-control genomewide association study, Huffmeier
et al. (2010) found significant association of dbSNP rs33980500 with
psoriatic arthritis in a subset of cases and controls (P = 1.13 x
10(-20), OR = 1.95). Functional assays showed reducing binding of this
TRAF3IP2 variant to TRAF6 (602355), suggesting altered modulation of
immunoregulatory signals through altered TRAF interactions as a novel
and shared pathway for psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis vulgaris.
Huffmeier et al. (2010) referred to the amino acid change correlated
with this SNP as ASP10ASN.

;;RAP1-INTERACTING ADAPTOR MOLECULE; RIAM;;
RETINOIC ACID-RESPONSIVE PROLINE-RICH PROTEIN 1; RARP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display to identify retinoic acid-induced transcripts in
a promyeloleukemic cell line, followed by 5-prime RACE of a thymus cDNA
library, Inagaki et al. (2003) cloned RARP1. The deduced 666-amino acid
protein contains an N-terminal proline-rich domain, a RAS
(190020)-associated domain, a PH domain, and a long C-terminal
proline-rich domain. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.6-kb transcript
in most tissues, with highest expression in thymus, spleen, liver, and
peripheral leukocytes. RNA dot blot analysis detected RARP1
preferentially expressed in thymus, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, and
peripheral leukocytes. Western blot analysis showed that endogenous
promyeloleukemic cell RARP1 has an apparent molecular mass of 110 kD.
Immunostaining of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells found RARP1
localized to the cytoplasm. Endogenous mouse Rarp1 was found in the
cytoplasm of megakaryocytes or their progenitor cells in bone marrow and
spleen.

Using a constitutively GTP-bound mutant RAP1 (RAP1A; 179520) as bait in
a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library, Lafuente et al.
(2004) cloned RIAM. The deduced 665-amino acid protein contains
predicted coiled-coil regions immediately N-terminal and C-terminal of
the RAS-associated domain, as well as several proline-rich regions,
including 6 profilin (176610)-binding motifs and 6 Enabled (ENA;
609061)/VASP (601703) homology-1 (EVH1) domain-binding motifs. RIAM
shares highest similarity with lamellipodin (RAPH1; 609035) and lower
similarity with GRB7 (601522), GRB10 (601523), and GRB14 (601524).
Database analysis identified a possible RIAM splice variant.

GENE FUNCTION

Using promoter-reporter gene assays, Inagaki et al. (2003) found that
RARP1 suppressed transcription from AP1 (165160) and SRE sites, but not
CRE sites, in all cell lines examined. The proline-rich regions of RARP1
suppressed AP1 transactivation.

Lafuente et al. (2004) found that RIAM interacted with profilin and
VASP, molecules that regulate actin dynamics, as well as with RAP1-GTP.
Overexpression of RIAM induced cell spreading and lamellipodia
formation, changes that require actin polymerization. Overexpression
also induced integrin (see 600065) activation and cell adhesion. In
contrast, RIAM knockdown cells had reduced content of polymerized actin.
Knockdown also displaced RAP1-GTP from the plasma membrane and abrogated
RAP1-induced adhesion. Lafuente et al. (2004) concluded that RIAM links
RAP1 to integrin activation and plays a role in regulating actin
dynamics.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lafuente et al. (2004) mapped the RIAM
gene to chromosome 10p12.1.

607556	TITLE *607556 TWIST, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 2; TWIST2
;;DERMIS-EXPRESSED PROTEIN 1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; DERMO1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the yeast 2-hybrid system to screen for tissue-specific basic
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, which dimerize with the ubiquitous
protein E12 (147141) Li et al. (1995) cloned mouse Dermo1. Within its
bHLH region, the 160-amino acid Dermo1 protein shares extensive homology
with members of the Twist family of bHLH proteins (see TWIST; 601622),
which are expressed in embryonic mesoderm. During mouse embryogenesis,
Dermo1 showed an expression pattern similar to, but distinct from, that
of mouse Twist. Dermo1 was expressed at a low level in the sclerotome
and dermatome of the somites and in the limb buds at day 10.5 postcoitum
(pc), and it accumulated predominantly in the dermatome, prevertebrae,
and the derivatives of the branchial arches by day 13.5 pc. As
differentiation of prechondrial cells proceeded, Dermo1 expression
became restricted to the perichondrium. Expression of Dermo1 increased
continuously in the dermis through day 17.5 pc and was also detected in
the dermis of neonates, but it became downregulated in adult tissues.

By screening femur and rib cDNA libraries using mouse Twist as the
probe, Lee et al. (2000) cloned human DERMO1. The deduced DERMO1 protein
contains 160 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 18 kD.
There are only 5 amino acid differences in the bHLH domains of DERMO1
and TWIST, and the N and C termini of these proteins also share
extensive homology. Human DERMO1 shares 99% amino acid identity with
mouse and rat Dermo1.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Perrin-Schmitt et al. (1997) mapped the
DERMO1 gene to chromosome 2q37.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (1995) showed that the mouse Dermo1 protein bound the E-box
consensus sequence in the presence of E12, but transcriptional activity
was not detectable. Instead, Dermo1 repressed transcriptional activity
of myogenic bHLH proteins.

Lee et al. (2000) demonstrated that human DERMO1 caused changes similar
to TWIST in the osteogenic properties of osteoblastic cells, such as
morphology, bone marker gene expression, and biochemical response to
cytokines. However, DERMO1 expression also had unique effects in
regulating the mechanism of proliferation, on alkaline phosphatase
enzyme activity, and in temporal expression patterns.

Gong and Li (2002) generated a series of mouse Dermo1 mutants to
characterize the role of each domain in transcriptional repression. They
determined that the HLH and C-terminal domains, but not the N-terminal
and the basic regions of Dermo1, were essential for transcriptional
repression activity. They also found that Dermo1 directly associates
with Mef2 (see 600660) to repress its transactivation domain, and
histone deacetylation is involved in Dermo1-mediated gene repression.

Sosic et al. (2003) showed that Twist and Dermo1, which they called
Twist1 and Twist2, respectively, were induced by a cytokine signaling
pathway that required the dorsal-related protein Rela (164014), a member
of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011) family of transcription
factors, in mice. Twist1 and Twist2 repressed cytokine gene expression
through interaction with Rela. Mice homozygous for a Twist2 null allele
or doubly heterozygous for Twist1 and Twist2 alleles showed elevated
expression of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in perinatal death
from cachexia. Sosic et al. (2003) concluded that there is an
evolutionarily conserved signaling circuit in which TWIST proteins
regulate cytokine signaling by establishing a negative feedback loop
that represses the NFKB-dependent cytokine pathway.

Bialek et al. (2004) determined that the Twist proteins transiently
inhibit Runx2 (600211) function during skeletal development in mice.
Twist1 and Twist2 were expressed in Runx2-expressing cells throughout
the skeleton early during development, and osteoblast-specific gene
expression occurred only after their expression decreased. Double
heterozygotes for Twist1 and Runx2 deletion showed none of the skull
abnormalities observed in Runx2 +/- mice, a Twist2 null background
rescued the clavicle phenotype of Runx2 +/- mice, and Twist1 or Twist2
deficiency led to premature osteoblast differentiation. The
antiosteogenic function of the Twist proteins was mediated by a domain
Bialek et al. (2004) called the Twist box, which interacted with the
Runx2 DNA-binding domain to inhibit its function.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 families with Setleis syndrome (FFDD3; 227260) mapping to
chromosome 2q37.3, Tukel et al. (2010) analyzed the candidate gene
TWIST2 and identified homozygous nonsense mutations that segregated with
disease in each family (607556.0001 and 607556.0002, respectively).

In 2 Mexican-Nahua sibs with the characteristic features of Setleis
syndrome, Cervantes-Barragan et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a
1-bp deletion in the TWIST2 gene (607556.0003). Their parents and 2 sibs
were heterozygous for the mutation, and all 4 heterozygotes exhibited
distichiasis of the upper eyelids and partial absence of the lower
eyelashes. Cervantes-Barragan et al. (2011) concluded that heterozygotes
with TWIST2 mutations may have syndromic manifestations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tukel et al. (2010) analyzed Twist2 knockout mice on a 129/C57 mixed
background and observed a facial phenotype similar to that of Setleis
syndrome patients, including thin skin and sparse hair with bilateral
pronounced alopecic areas between the ears and the eyes, resembling the
bitemporal forceps marks in humans. They also had absent lower
eyelashes, narrow snouts, protruding chins, short anterior-posterior
head diameters, and low-set dysmorphic ears. Histologically, the
bilateral alopecic areas in the Twist2 -/- mice were similar to the
defects in Setleis syndrome patients, including hypoplastic dermis and
absence of epidermal appendages and subcutaneous fat. The knockout mice
also had absent or hypoplastic Meibomian glands, as seen in Setleis
syndrome patients.

In affected members from a large multigenerational Puerto Rican family
segregating autosomal recessive Setleis syndrome (FFDD3; 227260),
originally reported by Setleis et al. (1963), Tukel et al. (2010)
identified homozygosity for a 486C-T transition in the TWIST2 gene,
resulting in a gln119-to-ter (Q119X) substitution that was predicted to
truncate the C terminus after the bHLH motif. Quantitative PCR in
transfected HeLa cells revealed 3- to 4-fold decreased amounts of mRNA
compared to wildtype; immunoblot analysis showed that the mutant protein
was unstable, consistent with nonsense-mediated decay.

In affected members of a consanguineous Arab family with Setleis
syndrome (FFDD3; 227260), originally reported by Al-Gazali and
Al-Talabani (1996), Tukel et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a
324C-T transition in the TWIST2 gene, resulting in a gln65-to-ter (Q65X)
substitution that was predicted to eliminate the bHLH region and the C
terminus. Quantitative PCR in transfected HeLa cells revealed 3- to
4-fold decreased amounts of mRNA compared to wildtype; immunoblot
analysis showed that the mutant protein was unstable, consistent with
nonsense-mediated decay.

.0003

In an 8-year-old girl and her 1-month-old brother with Setleis syndrome
(FFDD3; 227260), Cervantes-Barragan et al. (2011) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (168delC) in the TWIST2 gene, causing a
frameshift resulting in premature termination. Their parents and 2 of
their sibs, who were heterozygous for the deletion, exhibited eyelash
manifestations consisting of upper lid distichiasis and partial absence
of the lower eyelashes.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In eukaryotic cells, the nucleus is spatially and functionally separated
from the cytoplasm by the nuclear envelope. All molecular transport
across the nuclear envelope takes place exclusively through the nuclear
pore. Small molecules, such as ions and polypeptides smaller than
approximately 40 kD, pass freely through the nuclear pore, but larger
molecules require a carrier protein. The nuclear pore is formed by the
nuclear pore complex (NPC), an 8-fold symmetrical structure composed of
multiple copies of about 30 different proteins called nucleoporins. The
NUP98 gene encodes a NUP98-NUP96 precursor protein that is cleaved by
its own peptidase activity to produce 2 distinct nucleoporins, NUP98 and
NUP96. Alternative splicing also generates NUP98 transcripts that encode
NUP98, but not NUP96. NUP98 is a peripheral nucleoporin located at both
the cytoplasmic and nuclear sides of the central channel of the NPC. It
contains a characteristic gly-leu-phe-gly (GFLG) repeat region that
contributes to nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking, including mRNA export.
NUP98 also plays roles in gene expression, mitotic checkpoint, and
pathogenesis. NUP96 is a scaffold component of the NPC (review by
Iwamoto et al., 2010).

CLONING

Fontoura et al. (1999) identified NUP96 as a nucleoporin with a
predicted molecular mass of 96 kD. NUP96 is generated through an unusual
biogenesis pathway that involves synthesis of a 186-kD precursor
protein. Proteolytic cleavage of the precursor yields 2 nucleoporins:
NUP98 and NUP96. NUP96 is proteolytically cleaved in vivo. NUP96 is
localized to the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC at or near the
nucleoplasmic basket. The correct targeting of both NUP96 and NUP98 to
the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC was found to be dependent on
proteolytic cleavage, suggesting that the cleavage process may regulate
NPC assembly.

In their review, Iwamoto et al. (2010) noted that alternative splicing
produces 4 human NUP98 variants. Variants 1 and 4 are generated by
alternative splicing in exon 20 and are translated into the NUP98-NUP96
precursor protein. Variants 2 and 3 are generated without splicing in
exon 20 and are translated into NUP98 connected to a 57-amino acid
polypeptide tail that is removed from NUP98 by autocleavage. Variants 1
and 4 differ from one another due to alternative splicing in exon 29,
and variants 2 and 3 differ from one another due to alternative splicing
in exon 10.

MAPPING

Nakamura et al. (1996) mapped the NUP98 gene to 11p15 by analysis of a
panel of somatic cell hybrids and by pulsed field gel electrophoresis.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunogold electron microscopy, Radu et al. (1995) localized the
NUP98 protein to the nucleoplasmic side of the nuclear pore. Nakamura et
al. (1996) stated that ligand blot analysis suggested that NUP98
functions as a docking protein for cytosol-mediated docking of import
substrates. The docking function has been localized to the N-terminal
half of NUP98, the part of NUP98 that is retained in the NUP98/HOXA9
fusion (Radu et al., 1995).

Rosenblum and Blobel (1999) determined that no protease is involved in
the processing of the NUP98-NUP96 precursor, but the molecule
specifically cleaves itself between phe863 and ser864. The 2 fragments
then form a low-affinity complex.

Von Kobbe et al. (2000) demonstrated that NUP98 is a target of the
vesicular stomatitis virus M protein-mediated inhibition of mRNA nuclear
export.

Enninga et al. (2002) demonstrated that NUP98 and NUP96 are upregulated
by interferon. M protein-mediated inhibition of mRNA nuclear export was
reversed when cells were treated with interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570) or
transfected with a cDNA encoding NUP98 and NUP96. Enninga et al. (2002)
concluded that increased NUP98 and NUP96 expression constitutes an
IFN-mediated mechanism that reverses M protein-mediated inhibition of
gene expression.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Enninga et al. (2003) determined that
SEC13L1 (600152) and an N-terminal region of NUP96 interact. By mutation
analysis, they determined that the WD repeat region of SEC13L1 and
residues 201 to 378 of NUP96 were required for the interaction. SEC13L1
did not bind NUP98. During mitosis, SEC13L1 was dispersed throughout the
cell, whereas a pool of NUP96 colocalized with the spindle apparatus.

Jeganathan et al. (2005) showed that in mitosis, timely destruction of
securin (604147) by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is regulated by
the nucleocytoplasmic transport factors Rae1 (603343) and Nup98. They
showed that combined haploinsufficiency for Rae1 and Nup98 in mice
results in premature separation of sister chromatids, severe aneuploidy,
and untimely degradation of securin. They also determined that Rae1 and
Nup98 form a complex with cadherin-1 (Cdh1; 192090)-activated APC,
APC(Cdh1), in early mitosis and specifically inhibit APC(Cdh1)-mediated
ubiquitination of securin. Dissociation of Rae1 and Nup98 from APC(Cdh1)
coincides with the release of the mitotic checkpoint protein BubR1
(602860) from Cdc20 (603618)-activated APC at the metaphase to anaphase
transition. Jeganathan et al. (2005) concluded that together, their
results suggest that Rae1 and Nup98 are temporal regulators of APC(Cdh1)
that maintain euploidy by preventing unscheduled degradation of securin.

Wang et al. (2009) reported that fusing an histone H3 lysine-4
trimethylation (H3K4me3)-binding PHD finger, such as the C-terminal PHD
finger of PHF23 (612910) or JARID1A (180202), to a common fusion partner
NUP98, as identified in human leukemias (Reader et al., 2007; van Zutven
et al., 2006), generated potent oncoproteins that arrested hematopoietic
differentiation and induced acute myeloid leukemia in murine models. In
these processes, a PHD finger that specifically recognizes H3K4me3/2
marks was essential for leukemogenesis. Mutations in PHD fingers that
abrogated H3K4me3 binding also abolished leukemic transformation.
NUP98-PHD fusion prevented the differentiation-associated removal of
H3K4me3 at many loci encoding lineage-specific transcription factors
such as Hox(s) (see 142950), Gata3 (131320), Meis1 (601739), Eya1
(601653), and Pbx1 (176310), and enforced their active gene
transcription in murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.
Mechanistically, NUP98-PHD fusions act as 'chromatin boundary factors,'
dominating over polycomb-mediated gene silencing to 'lock'
developmentally critical loci into an active chromatin state (H3K4me3
with induced histone acetylation), a state that defined leukemia stem
cells. Wang et al. (2009) concluded that their studies represented the
first report that deregulation of the PHD finger, an effector of
specific histone modification, perturbs the epigenetic dynamics on
developmentally critical loci, leading to catastrophic cell fate
decision making and oncogenesis during mammalian development.

Rapid disassembly of the NPC during mitotic entry requires the master
mitotic kinase CDK1 (116940) and involves phosphorylation of many
nucleoporins. Laurell et al. (2011) identified phosphorylation of NUP98
as an early and crucial step during NPC disassembly in HeLa cells.
Recombinant NUP98 was hyperphosphorylated by PLK1 (602098), NEK6
(604884), and other NEK family members in vitro. Mass spectrometric
analysis revealed that NUP98 was phosphorylated on ser591 and ser822 by
NEK6 and on thr529, thr536, ser595, ser606, and thr653 by CDK1.
Phosphomimetic mutants of NUP98 localized to the cytoplasm instead of
NPCs. Conversely, phosphodeficient NUP98 mutants significantly delayed
NPC disassembly and loss of the nuclear envelope permeability barrier.
Laurell et al. (2011) concluded that NUP98 phosphorylation is critical
for NPC disassembly at the onset of mitosis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Hodel et al. (2002) reported that the 3-dimensional structure of the
C-terminal domain of NUP98 revealed a novel protein fold, and thus a new
class of autocatalytic proteases. The structure further indicated that
the nucleoporin RNA-binding motif is unlikely to bind to RNA. The C
terminus was found to contain sequences that target NUP98 to the nuclear
pore complex. Noncovalent interactions between the C-terminal domain and
the cleaved peptide tail were visible and suggested a model for
cleavage-dependent targeting of NUP98 to the nuclear pore.

CYTOGENETICS

Lam and Aplan (2001) reviewed gene fusions involving NUP98. The NUP98
gene is fused to 1 of a considerable number of other genes in various
hematologic malignancies as a consequence of chromosomal translocation.
The common theme in all NUP98 chimeras is a transcript consisting of the
5-prime part of NUP98 and the 3-prime portion of the partner gene.
However, apart from the frequent fusion to different homeobox genes,
there is no apparent similarity among the other partners.

Nakamura et al. (1996) showed that in 3 patients with t(7;11), the
chromosome rearrangement created a genomic fusion between the HOXA9 gene
(142956) and the nucleoporin gene NUP98 on 11p15. Expression of Hoxa7
and Hoxa9 is activated by proviral integration in BXH2 murine myeloid
leukemias; this result, combined with the mapping of the HOXA cluster to
7p15, suggested that one of the HOXA genes may be involved in the human
t(7;11)(p15;p15) translocation found in some myeloid leukemia patients.
The translocation produced an invariant chimeric NUP98/HOXA9 transcript
containing the amino terminal half of NUP98 fused in-frame to HOXA9.
These studies identified HOXA9 as an important human myeloid leukemia
gene and suggested an important role for nucleoporins in human myeloid
leukemia, given that a second nucleoporin, NUP214 (114350), had also
been implicated in human myeloid leukemia. The 11p15 gene was identified
by exon trapping experiments.

Borrow et al. (1996) likewise identified the HOXA9 and NUP98 genes as
the parents of the fusion in t(7;11)(p15;p15) in acute myeloid leukemia
of the FABM2 and M4 types. Borrow et al. (1996) suggested that the
predicted NUP98/HOXA9 fusion protein may promote leukemogenesis through
inhibition of HOXA9-mediated terminal differentiation and/or aberrant
nucleocytoplasmic transport.

Hussey et al. (1999) identified the breakpoint genes of the
translocation t(4;11)(q21;p15) that occurred in a case of adult T-cell
acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL). By analysis of somatic cell hybrids,
they showed that the chromosome 11 breakpoint occurred within the NUP98
gene, which is rearranged in several acute myeloid leukemia
translocations. Using 3-prime RACE, Hussey et al. (1999) identified the
fusion partner of NUP98 as RAP1GDS1 (179502). This was the first report
of the involvement of RAP1GDS1 in any malignancy. The product of the
RAP1GDS1 gene, usually referred to as smgGDS, has guanine nucleotide
exchange factor activity (Mizuno et al., 1991). In the fusion
transcript, which the authors referred to as NRG, the 5-prime end of the
NUP98 gene was joined in-frame to the coding region of the RAP1GDS1
gene. This joined the FG repeat-rich region of NUP98 to RAP1GDS1, which
largely consists of tandem armadillo repeats. Hussey et al. (1999) found
that the NRG fusion maintained the reading frame of RAP1GDS1. The
RAP1GDS1 sequence in NRG started at nucleotide 5 of the coding sequence.
The methionine and the first G of the codon for aspartic acid were lost.
However, the first aspartic acid was retained in the fusion protein,
because the last base of NUP98 exon B is a G. Hussey et al. (1999)
showed that this translocation is recurrent in T-ALL.

Nakamura et al. (1999) studied a translocation fusion gene in acute
myelogenous leukemia in which the promoter of the nucleoporin gene on
11p15 was fused to the DNA-binding domain of PRRX1 (167420).

Jaju et al. (1999) identified a recurrent cryptic translocation,
t(5;11)(q35;p15.5), associated with a deletion of the long arm of
chromosome 5 in de novo childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML; see
601626). Jaju et al. (2001) confirmed that the chromosome 11 breakpoint
gene is NUP98 and cloned the chromosome 5 fusion partner, NSD1 (606681).
Nucleotide 1552 of NUP98 was fused in-frame to nucleotide 3504 of NSD1.

Constitutive activation of tyrosine kinases, such as the BCR/ABL
(151410, 189980) fusion associated with t(9;22)(q34;q22), is a hallmark
of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; 608232) in humans. Expression of
BCR/ABL is both necessary and sufficient to cause a chronic
myeloproliferative syndrome in murine bone marrow transplantation
models, and depends absolutely on kinase activity. Progression of CML to
acute leukemia (blast crisis) in humans had been associated with
acquisition of secondary chromosomal translocations, including the
t(7;11)(p15;p15) resulting in the NUP98/HOXA9 fusion protein. Dash et
al. (2002) demonstrated that BCR/ABL cooperates with NUP98/HOXA9 to
cause blast crisis in the murine model. The phenotype depends on
expression of both BCR/ABL and NUP98/HOXA9, but tumors retain
sensitivity to the ABL inhibitor STI571 in vitro and in vivo. This
paradigm is applicable to other constitutively activated tyrosine
kinases such as TEL/PDGFRB (600618, 173410). The experiments of Dash et
al. (2002) documented cooperative effects between constitutively
activated tyrosine kinases, which confer proliferative and survival
properties to hematopoietic cells, with mutations that impair
differentiation, such as the NUP98/HOXA9 fusion, giving rise to the
acute myeloid leukemia phenotype. Furthermore, these data indicated that
despite acquisition of additional mutations, CML blast crisis cells
retain their dependence on BCR/ABL for proliferation and survival.

Rosati et al. (2002) reported a fusion between the NUP98 and NSD3
(607083) genes in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia associated with
t(8;11)(p11.2;p15). Hitherto, acute myeloid leukemia had been reported
with translocations creating chimeric genes between NUP98 and PMX1
(PRRX1), HOXD13 (142989), NSD1, HOXA9, LEDGF, DDX10 (601235), and TOP1
(126420). In patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and
t(4;11)(q21;p21), fusion of the NUP98 gene to the RAP1GDS1 gene had been
observed (Hussey et al., 1999).

Arai et al. (1997) showed that the recurrent chromosome abnormality
inv(11)(p15q22), which is associated with de novo and therapy-related
myeloid malignancies, results in fusion of the nucleoporin gene NUP98
with DDX10. In DDX10 and NUP98, the inv(11) breakpoints occurred within
2 introns of each gene, and the 2 genes merged in-frame to produce the
chimeric transcripts characteristic of this translocation. Although 2
reciprocal chimeric products, NUP98-DDX10 and DDX10-NUP98, were
predicted, only NUP98-DDX10 appeared to be implicated in tumorigenesis.
DDX10 is involved in ribosome assembly, and NUP98 is a nuclear pore
complex protein and a target of other chromosomal translocations found
in AML. Arai et al. (1997) predicted the NUP98-DDX10 fusion protein may
promote leukemogenesis through aberrant nucleoplasmic transport of mRNA
or alterations in ribosome assembly.

Ahuja et al. (1999) cloned and characterized a t(11;20)(p15;q11)
translocation from patients with therapy-related AML and therapy-related
myelodysplastic syndromes. They found that the breakpoint on 11p15
targets the NUP98 gene and results in the separation of the N-terminal
FXFG repeats from the RNA-binding domain located in the C terminus. The
breakpoint on 20q11 occurred within the TOP1 gene. As a result, a
chimeric mRNA encoding the NUP98 FXFG repeats fused to the body of TOP1.
Ahuja et al. (1999) concluded that NUP98 is a recurrent target in
therapy-related malignancies and that TOP1 is a previously unrecognized
target for chromosomal translocations.

Taketani et al. (2002) found that in the t(2;11)(q31;p15) translocation
2 alternatively spliced 5-prime NUP98 transcripts were fused in-frame to
the HOXD11 gene (142986). The NUP98/HOXD fusion genes encode similar
fusion proteins, suggesting that NUP98/HOXD11 and NUP98/HOXD13 fusion
proteins play a role in leukemogenesis through similar mechanisms.

The NUP98 gene had been found at the breakpoints of several distinct
chromosomal translocations in patients with both de novo and
therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes and AML. Using combined
cytogenetic and molecular analyses, Ahuja et al. (2001) found
rearrangements of the NUP98 gene in the leukemic cells of 2 patients
with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML during disease evolution.
Analysis of the t(7;11)(p15;p15) translocation from 1 of the patients
showed an in-frame NUP98/HOXA9 fusion. The fusion points were similar to
those previously reported from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes
or AML. The results indicated that the NUP98 gene is an additional,
albeit infrequent, genetic target during clonal evolution of CML.

Panagopoulos et al. (2003) reported a patient with de novo AML with a
t(11;12)(p15;q13) translocation resulting in a novel NUP98/HOXC13
(142976) fusion gene. FISH analyses showed a fusion signal on the
derivative chromosome 11, indicating a NUP98/HOXC chimera, whereas no
fusion was found on the derivative chromosome 12, suggesting that the
reciprocal fusion gene was deleted. Thus, NUP98/HOXC13 is of
pathogenetic importance in t(11;12)-positive AML.

Lahortiga et al. (2003) noted that the NUP98 gene had been reported to
be fused to 13 partner genes in hematologic malignancies with 11p15
translocations. Twelve of the 13 had been identified in patients with
myeloid neoplasias and only 1, RAP1GDS1, was fused with NUP98 in 5
patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Three of these
patients coexpressed T cell and myeloid markers, suggesting a specific
association of RAP1GDS1 fusion with a subset of T-ALL originated from an
early progenitor, which has a potential to express mature T-cell
antigens as well as myeloid markers. Lahortiga et al. (2003) described a
new NUP98 partner involved in a t(10;11)(q25;p15) in a patient with
acute biphenotypic leukemia, showing coexpression of mature T cell and
myeloid markers. The gene involved, located at 10q25, was identified as
adducin-3 (ADD3; 601568) using 3-prime RACE. ADD3 codes for the
ubiquitously expressed subunit gamma of the adducin protein and it seems
to play an important role in the skeletal organization of the cell
membrane. Both NUP98/ADD3 and ADD3/NUP98 fusion transcription were
expressed in the patient. Adducin shares with the product of RAP1GDS1,
and with all of the nonhomeobox NUP98 partners, the presence of a region
with significant probability of adopting a coiled-coil conformation.
This region is always retained in the fusion transcript with the NH2
terminus FG repeats of NUP98, suggesting an important role in the
mechanism of leukemogenesis.

Panagopoulos et al. (2006) reported the case of a fourth NUP98 chimera
in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; a t(11;18)(p15;q12) resulted in
a novel NUP98 fusion. They found that exon 12 of NUP98 was fused
in-frame with exon 5 SETBP1. Nested PCR did not amplify the reciprocal
SETBP1/NUP98, suggesting that the NUP98/SETBP1 transcript is
pathogenetically important.

In a 42-year-old man with AML, Reader et al. (2007) identified a cryptic
translocation, t(11;17)(p15;p13), that resulted in in-frame fusion of
exon 13 of NUP98 to exon 4 of PHF23 (612910). The deduced chimeric
protein contains the N-terminal half of NUP98 fused to the C-terminal
functional domains of PHF23.

Such et al. (2011) identified a NUP98/RARG (180190) fusion gene
resulting from a t(11;12)(p15;p13) translocation in bone marrow cells
derived from a 35-year-old man with AML that had morphologic and
immunophenotypic features of the hypergranular subtype of acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APL; 612376). Sequence analysis determined that
NUP98 exon 12 was fused in-frame to RARG exon 4, predicted to encode an
862-residue protein with aberrant RARG receptor function. The patient
was treated with standard chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation;
response to ATRA was not assessed.

Tosi et al. (2005) identified a translocation, t(6;11)(q24.1;p15.5), in
a patient with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. RT-PCR and sequencing
revealed a transcript that contained exon 13 of NUP98 fused in-frame
with exon 2 of C6ORF80 (CCDC28A; 615353). The reciprocal fusion
transcript was not detected.

Petit et al. (2012) found that the NUP98-CCDC28A transcript contains
1,833 nucleotides of NUP98 fused in-frame to nucleotide 384 of CDCD28A.
The resultant 712-amino acid protein contains the N-terminal
transactivating GLFG repeats of NUP98 fused to CCDC28A beginning at
amino acid 77 and including its C-terminal coiled-coil domain. The
fusion protein was expressed in the nucleus following transfection of
primary mouse bone marrow cells. Immortalized mouse cells expressing
human NUP98-CCDC28A exhibited myeloblast morphology, proliferated in a
cytokine-independent manner, and caused fatal myeloproliferative
neoplasms in transplanted mice, with selective expansion of
granulocyte-macrophage progenitors in bone marrow.

ANIMAL MODEL

Iwasaki et al. (2005) generated transgenic mice in which the NUP98/HOXA9
fusion gene was specifically expressed in the myeloid lineage under the
control of the cathepsin G promoter. Approximately 20% of the transgenic
mice developed acute myeloid leukemia after a long latency period. When
NUP98/HOXA9 was introduced into the sensitive BXH2 mouse strain, it
promoted onset of retrovirus-induced myeloid leukemia. By examining
common retrovirus integration sites in these mice, Iwasaki et al. (2005)
found that Meis1 (601739), Dnalc4 (610565), Fcgr2b (604590), Fcrl
(606891), and Con1 cooperated with NUP98/HOXA9 in promoting the
development of myeloid leukemias. Using a transformation assay with
mouse NIH3T3 cells, Iwasaki et al. (2005) confirmed that these genes
cooperated with NUP98/HOXA9 in inducing the transformed phenotype,
although none alone were transforming.

605002	TITLE *605002 CORONIN 2B; CORO2B
;;CORONIN-LIKE PROTEIN C; CLIPINC
DESCRIPTION The Dictyostelium actin-binding protein coronin accumulates at the
leading edges of motile cells and in crown-shaped extensions on the
dorsal cell surface. Coronin is involved in cell motility, cytokinesis,
and phagocytosis, all of which depend on cytoskeletal rearrangement; see
CORO1A (605000).

By screening a frontal cortex cDNA library with a brain-enriched clone
showing similarity to Dictyostelium coronin, Nakamura et al. (1999)
isolated a full-length cDNA encoding CORO2B, which they called CLIPINC.
The predicted 475-amino acid CORO2B protein has an N-terminal domain
containing 5 WD repeats and a succeeding domain with a tendency to form
alpha helices. Northern blot analysis detected abundant expression of an
approximately 4.0-kb CORO2B transcript in brain, with moderate
expression in heart and ovary, and little or no expression in other
tissues tested. In contrast, CORO1A is primarily expressed in immune
system tissues, and CORO2A (602159) is predominantly expressed in colon,
prostate, and testis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed Coro2a
expression in mouse cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, olfactory
bulb, and cerebellum, as well as in the inner nuclear layer of embryonic
retina and embryonic olfactory bulb. Cosedimentation analysis
demonstrated that CORO2B associates with F-actin. Immunofluorescence
analysis indicated that CORO2B accumulates at neurite tips, at focal
adhesions in association with VCL (193065), and along stress fibers.

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the CORO2B
gene, which they called KIAA0925, to chromosome 15.

610470	TITLE *610470 TRANSFER RNA PHOSPHOTRANSFERASE 1; TRPT1
;;tRNA PHOSPHOTRANSFERASE 1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching and screening of a human 18-week-old fetal brain
cDNA library, Hu et al. (2003) identified TRPT1, the homolog of S.
cerevisiae tRNA phosphotransferase-1 (TPT1). In yeast, TPT1 catalyzes
the removal of the 2-prime-phosphate from ligated tRNA during pre-tRNA
splicing and maturation. The deduced 253-amino acid human protein has a
predicted molecular mass of 27.8 kD and contains a DUF60/KptA domain. It
shares 83% and 40% sequence identity with the mouse and S. cerevisiae
homologs, respectively. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.0-kb
transcript with highest expression in skeletal muscle followed by heart,
intermediate expression in kidney and liver, low expression in thymus
and placenta, barely detectable expression in brain and colon, and no
expression in spleen, small intestine, lung, and peripheral blood
leukocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a plasmid shuffling experiment with an S. cerevisiae TPT1 mutant
strain, Hu et al. (2003) showed that TRPT1 functionally complements the
mutant phenotype.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hu et al. (2003) determined that the TRPT1 gene contains 8 exons and
spans approximately 2.5 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hu et al. (2003) mapped the TRPT1 gene to
chromosome 11q13.

;;cAMP-REGULATED PHOSPHOPROTEIN, 19-KD
cAMP-REGULATED PHOSPHOPROTEIN, 16-KD, INCLUDED; ARPP16, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The 19-kD cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein plays a role in regulating
mitosis by inhibiting protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A; see 176915) (summary
by Gharbi-Ayachi et al., 2010).

CLONING

By screening striatal cDNA libraries with rodent and bovine probes,
Brene et al. (1994) obtained cDNAs encoding ARPP16, its splice variant,
ARPP19, and ARPP21 (605488). The deduced 96-amino acid ARPP16 protein is
99% identical to the rat and cow proteins. Compared with ARPP16, ARPP19
has 16 additional N-terminal amino acids. Northern blot analysis
detected a 1.7-kb transcript. In situ hybridization analysis revealed
expression of ARPP16/19, DARPP32, and ARPP21, with variable intensity,
in caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens, cerebellar cortex, and
neocortex.

Heron et al. (1998) cloned ARPP19 and showed that it shares considerable
homology, except in the N-terminal region, with alpha-endosulfine (ENSA;
603061).

GENE FUNCTION

Mochida et al. (2010) identified alpha-endosulfine (ENSA; 603061) and
Arpp19 as phosphorylation-dependent inhibitors of protein phosphatase-2A
(PP2A)-B55-delta (PPP2R2D; 613992) and physiologic substrates of the
protein kinase Greatwall (MASTL; 608221).

Initiation and maintenance of mitosis require the inhibition of PP2A,
which dephosphorylates mitotic substrates. The protein kinase Greatwall
(Gwl) is required to maintain mitosis through PP2A inhibition.
Gharbi-Ayachi et al. (2010) described how Gwl activation results in PP2A
inhibition. They identified Arpp19 and Ensa as 2 substrates of Gwl that,
when phosphorylated by this kinase, associate with and inhibit PP2A,
thus promoting mitotic entry. Conversely, in the absence of Gwl
activity, Arpp19 and Ensa are dephosphorylated and lose their capacity
to bind and inhibit PP2A. Gharbi-Ayachi et al. (2010) stated that
although both proteins can inhibit PP2A, endogenous Arpp19, but not
Ensa, is responsible for PP2A inhibition and mitotic entry in Xenopus
egg extracts.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ARPP19
gene to chromosome 15 (TMAP stSG3285).

607203	TITLE *607203 SALVADOR, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; SAV1
;;SAV;;
WW DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN, 45-KD; WW45
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database using C. elegans and Drosophila WW
domain-containing protein sequences as bait, followed by 5-prime and
3-prime RACE using a human heart cDNA library, Valverde (2000) obtained
a full-length cDNA encoding WW45. The deduced 383-amino acid protein has
a predicted molecular mass of approximately 45 kD. It contains 2 WW
domains, a region rich in prolines and glutamines, and a coiled-coil
region, as well as a nuclear localization signal and 2 endoplasmic
reticulum retention signals. The mouse Ww45 cDNA has a different 3-prime
untranslated region and encodes a protein that shares 93% identity with
human WW45. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that both
human and mouse WW45 transcripts (1.2 and 2.7 kb, respectively) are
ubiquitously expressed in adult tissues. In human, highest expression
was in pancreas, while in mouse, highest expression was in testis.
Northern blot analysis of whole mouse embryos showed that embryonic
expression of Ww45 first occurred at 7 days postcoitum. Expression
levels markedly decreased at day 11 and remained low at days 15 and 17,
suggesting that WW45 expression is developmentally regulated.
Accordingly, expression of human WW45 was found to be higher in fetal
heart than in adult heart.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Valverde (2000) mapped the WW45 gene to
chromosome 14q13-q23.

GENE FUNCTION

The mammalian core Hippo signaling components include Ste20 family
kinases Mst1 (604965) and Mst2 (605030), which are homologous to
Drosophila Hippo. To determine whether Hippo signaling controls
mammalian heart size, Heallen et al. (2011) inactivated Hippo pathway
components (e.g., SAV) in the developing mouse heart. Hippo-deficient
embryos had overgrown hearts with elevated cardiomyocyte proliferation.
Gene expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed
that Hippo signaling negatively regulates a subset of Wnt (see 606359)
target genes. Genetic interaction studies indicated that beta-catenin
(116806) heterozygosity suppressed the Hippo cardiomyocyte overgrowth
phenotype. Furthermore, the Hippo effector Yap (606608) interacts with
beta-catenin on Sox2 (184429) and Snai2 (602150) genes. Heallen et al.
(2011) concluded that their data uncovered a nuclear interaction between
Hippo and Wnt signaling that restricts cardiomyocyte proliferation and
controls heart size.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a screen for Drosophila mutations that result in tissue overgrowth,
Tapon et al. (2002) identified salvador (sav), a gene that promotes both
cell cycle exit and cell death. Elevated cyclin E (123837) and inhibitor
of apoptosis-1 (Diap1) levels were found in mutant cells, resulting in
delayed cell cycle exit and impaired apoptosis. Salvador contains 2 WW
domains and binds to the Warts (or Lats; see 603473) protein kinase.
Because WW45 is the human ortholog of salvador, Tapon et al. (2002)
sequenced the entire WW45 coding region in a panel of 52 tumor-derived
cell lines, representing a broad range of tissue types. One colon cancer
cell line, HCT15, had a heterozygous C-to-A mutation at nucleotide 554,
resulting in an asp185-to-ala substitution. This mutation was not
present in 185 population-based controls (370 chromosomes), indicating
that it is not a common polymorphism. The authors noted that HCT15
carries a mutation in the mismatch repair gene MSH6 (600678), which
appears to enhance the frequency of point mutations in other genes. Two
renal cancer cell lines, ACHN and 786-O, had deletions involving WW45.
The normal allele was not present in either cell line, indicating that
these cell lines were either homozygous or hemizygous for the deletion.
The WW45 transcript was undetectable by RT-PCR in both cell lines, and a
Southern blot using a probe derived from the 3-prime portion of the gene
demonstrated that this part of the gene was absent in both cell lines.
In cell line 786-O, PCR analysis of genomic DNA indicated that there was
a deletion of approximately 157 kb, with the 5-prime breakpoint between
exons 2 and 3 of WW45. The deletion in ACHN of approximately 138 kb
encompassed the entire gene. The common region of overlap between these
2 deletions was only 21 kb, containing exons 3 to 5 of WW45. No other
transcription units were identified within this 21 kb interval.

602327	TITLE *602327 PLECKSTRIN AND SEC7 DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN; PSD
;;TYL;;
EXCHANGE FACTOR FOR ARF6; EFA6;;
EFA6A
DESCRIPTION Perletti et al. (1997) identified a novel human gene on 10q24,
contiguous to the 3-prime end of the NFKB2 gene (164012) in a
tail-to-tail arrangement. They described a cDNA of 4,307 bp, isolated
from an adult human brain cDNA library, which contains an open reading
frame encoding a putative protein of 645 amino acids with a predicted
molecular weight of 71 kD. Database homology searches indicated that the
novel gene codes for a putative protein containing 2 discrete domains
with significant homology to the Sec7 and pleckstrin-homology (PH)
domains, respectively. They used the gene symbol PSD for
'pleckstrin-Sec7 domains.' Northern blot analysis of a panel of RNAs
from normal human tissues using the PSD cDNA as probe revealed the
presence of 3 different tissue-specific transcripts of approximately
4.3, 2.3, and 1.8 kb, the longest of which was expressed only in brain.
The data suggested that the PSD gene may encode a protein related to the
protein family containing both the Sec7 in the PH domains and thought to
be involved in signaling transduction processes. Other human proteins in
the same family include cytohesin-1 (Kolanus et al., 1996) and ARNO
(602488) (Chardin et al., 1996).

Derrien et al. (2002) reported that PSD, which they called EFA6A, is 63%
identical to EFA6B (PSD4; 614442) and contains a Sec7 domain adjacent to
a PH domain, followed by a C-terminal coiled-coil motif. Northern blot
analysis showed that EFA6A expression was largely restricted to brain,
with a smaller transcript expressed in small intestine, colon, and
ovary. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated punctate cell surface
expression of ARF6 (600464) and EFA6A, like EFA6B, in transfected baby
hamster kidney cells. Both EFA6 proteins also colocalized with F-actin
(see 102610).

GENE FUNCTION

Derrien et al. (2002) found that recombinant EFA6A stimulated nucleotide
exchange on myristoylated ARF6, with only low activity on ARF1 (103180).
The C-terminal region was involved in microvilli lengthening. Derrien et
al. (2002) concluded that EFA6 family guanine exchange factors are
modular proteins that work through the coordinated action of the
catalytic Sec7 domain to promote ARF6 activation, through the PH domain
to regulate association with specific subdomains of the plasma membrane,
and through the C-terminal region to control actin cytoskeletal
reorganization.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the PSD gene to chromosome 10q24.32 based on an
alignment of the PSD sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC142689) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NFKB1 (164011) or NFKB2 (164012) is bound to REL (164910), RELA, or RELB
(604758) to form the NFKB complex. The p50 (NFKB1)/p65 (RELA)
heterodimer is the most abundant form of NFKB. The NFKB complex is
inhibited by I-kappa-B proteins (NFKBIA, 164008 or NFKBIB, 604495),
which inactivate NFKB by trapping it in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation
of serine residues on the I-kappa-B proteins by kinases (IKBKA, 600664,
or IKBKB, 603258) marks them for destruction via the ubiquitination
pathway, thereby allowing activation of the NFKB complex. Activated NFKB
complex translocates into the nucleus and binds DNA at kappa-B-binding
motifs such as 5-prime GGGRNNYYCC 3-prime or 5-prime HGGARNYYCC 3-prime
(where H is A, C, or T; R is an A or G purine; and Y is a C or T
pyrimidine).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Zhong et al. (1998) reported that the transcriptional activity of
NF-kappa-B is stimulated upon phosphorylation of its p65 subunit on
serine-276 by protein kinase A (PKA). The transcriptional coactivator
CBP (600140)/p300 (602700) associates with NF-kappa-B p65 through 2
sites, an N-terminal domain that interacts with the C-terminal region of
unphosphorylated p65, and a second domain that only interacts with p65
phosphorylated on serine-276. Phosphorylation by PKA both weakens the
interaction between the N- and C-terminal regions of p65 and creates an
additional site for interaction with CBP/p300. Therefore, PKA regulates
the transcriptional activity of NF-kappa-B by modulating its interaction
with CBP/p300.

Jacobs and Harrison (1998) and Huxford et al. (1998) determined the
structure of the NFKBIA ankyrin repeat domain, bound to a partially
truncated NFKB heterodimer (p50/p65), by x-ray crystallography at 2.7-
and 2.3-angstrom resolution, respectively. It shows a stack of 6 NFKBIA
ankyrin repeats facing the C-terminal domains of the NFKB rel homology
regions. Contacts occur in discontinuous patches, suggesting a
combinatorial quality for ankyrin repeat specificity. The first 2
repeats cover an alpha helically ordered segment containing the p65
nuclear localization signal. The position of the sixth ankyrin repeat
shows that full-length NFKBIA will occlude the NFKB DNA-binding cleft.
The orientation of NFKBIA in the complex places its N- and C-terminal
regions in appropriate locations for their known regulatory functions.
Baeuerle (1998) discussed the model of interactions between NFKBIA and
NFKB.

GENE FUNCTION

Chen et al. (2001) noted that the events involved in the release of NFKB
from IKBA are relatively well understood, but the regulation of nuclear
forms of NFKB that ensure transient transcriptional responses are less
well delineated. Luciferase reporter analysis showed that treatment with
trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of multiple histone deacetylases
(e.g., HDAC1; 601241), results in prolonged intranuclear expression of
RELA after TNFA (191160) stimulation. Expression of HDAC3 (605166), but
not other HDACs, was found to inhibit kappa-B luciferase activity and
abolish the acetylation of RELA, which is mediated by p300 or CBP but
not PCAF (602303), in the absence of TSA. Coimmunoprecipitation and
mammalian 2-hybrid analyses indicated that RELA and HDAC3 associate
through their N termini. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that
coexpression of RELA with HDAC3, but not with HDAC1, results in
cytoplasmic instead of nuclear localization of RELA, and this is
dependent on the expression of exportin-1 (XPO1; 602559). Coexpression
of HDAC3 in the presence of p300 allowed binding of RELA to IKBA,
suggesting that deacetylation of RELA stimulates IKBA binding and the
termination of the NFKB transcriptional response. Fluorescence
microscopy showed that in the presence of HDAC3, RELA expression shifts
to the cytoplasm in wildtype murine embryo fibroblasts but not in
fibroblasts obtained from Ikba -/- mice, indicating that IKBA is
required for the nuclear export of deacetylated RELA. Chen et al. (2001)
concluded that RELA is a nonhistone substrate of HDAC3 and that
IKBA-dependent nuclear export of the HDAC3-deacetylated RELA replenishes
the depleted cytoplasmic pool of latent NFKB-IKBA complexes for
subsequent NFKB responses.

Zhong et al. (2002) demonstrated that transcriptionally inactive nuclear
NFKB in resting cells consists of homodimers of either p65 or p50
complexed with the histone deacetylase HDAC1. Only the p50-HDAC1
complexes bound to DNA and suppressed NFKB-dependent gene expression in
unstimulated cells. Appropriate stimulation caused nuclear localization
of NFKB complexes containing phosphorylated p65 that associated with CBP
and displaced the p50-HDAC1 complexes. These results demonstrated that
phosphorylation of p65 determines whether it associates with either CBP
or HDAC1, ensuring that only p65 entering the nucleus from cytoplasmic
NFKB-IKB complexes can activate transcription.

Because therapeutics inhibiting RAS and NFKB pathways are used to treat
human cancer, experiments assessing the effects of altering these
regulators have been performed in mice. The medical relevance of murine
studies is limited, however, by differences between mouse and human
skin, and by the greater ease of transforming murine cells. To study RAS
and NFKB in a setting more relevant to human tumorigenesis, Dajee et al.
(2003) expressed the active HRAS gly12-to-val mutation (190020.0001),
NFKB p65, and a stable NFKB repressor mutant of IKBA (164008) in human
skin tissue. Although implicated in promoting features of neoplasia in
other settings, coexpression of oncogenic RAS with NFKB subunits failed
to support proliferation. Coexpression of RAS and IKBA produced large
neoplasms with deep invasion through fat into underlying muscle and
fascia, similar to human squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), in 3 weeks.
Dajee et al. (2003) demonstrated that growth arrest triggered by
oncogenic RAS can be bypassed by IKBA-mediated blockade of NFKB and that
RAS opposed the increased susceptibility to apoptosis caused by NFKB
blockade, generating malignant human epidermal tissue resembling SCC.

Smahi et al. (2002) reviewed the NFKB signaling pathway, with emphasis
on its dysregulation in the genetic disorders incontinentia pigmenti
(308300), hypohidrotic/anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (see 305100),
anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (EDA-ID; 300291),
and EDA-ID with osteopetrosis and lymphoedema (300301).

In rat sciatic nerves, Nickols et al. (2003) found that expression of
the activated p65 subunit of NFKB was high in the nuclei of
premyelinating Schwann cells and then progressively declined until it
was nearly absent in adults. NFKB expression preceded and was necessary
for the upregulation of the transcription factor Oct6 (POU3F1; 602479),
which has been shown to play a role in the differentiation of promyelin
cells to myelinating cells. The authors concluded that NFKB is upstream
of Oct6 induction and is also required for the formation of peripheral
myelin.

Using cDNA microarray and in vitro analyses, Kelly et al. (2004) found
that the commensal bacterium Bacteroides thetaioatomicron attenuated
inflammatory responses, notably IL8 (146930) production, in intestinal
cell lines exposed to pathogenic Salmonella enteritidis and a number of
other inflammatory mediators. The commensal organism induced CRM1
(XPO1)-independent nuclear export, rather than import only, of the NFKB
subunit RELA, with an eventual predominance of RELA cytoplasmic
distribution after the peak of RELA induction by IL1A (147760) and IL1B
(147720). RELA nucleocytoplasmic redistribution coincided with export of
PPARG (601487), and immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that
PPARG-RELA association was dependent on the PPARG C-terminal
ligand-binding domain. Kelly et al. (2004) concluded that at least some
commensal bacteria contribute to immune homeostasis through an
antiinflammatory mechanism involving PPARG and NFKB.

Mazzeo et al. (2004) found positive immunostaining for activated p65
NFKB in nerve biopsies from 5 patients with chronic inflammatory
demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP; see 139393), 5 with familial
amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP; see 176300), and 3 with vasculitis.
Mild to moderate staining was detected in 2 to 15% of epineurial and
endoneurial vessel walls, 5 to 10% of outer layers of myelin sheaths,
and in amyloid deposits of FAP. There was an association between NFKB
staining and localization of the terminal membrane attack complex (MAC)
of the complement system. No staining was seen in 3 control specimens.
Mazzeo et al. (2004) suggested a role for NFKB in inflammatory
conditions of the peripheral nervous system.

Signaling by the transcription factor NFKB involves its release from IKB
in the cytosol, followed by translocation into the nucleus. NFKB
regulation of I-kappa-B-alpha transcription represents a delayed
negative feedback loop that drives oscillations in NFKB translocation.
Nelson et al. (2004) reported that single-cell time-lapse imaging and
computational modeling of NFKB localization showed asynchronous
oscillations following cell stimulation that decreased in frequency with
increased I-kappa-B-alpha transcription. Transcription of target genes
depended on oscillation persistence, involving cycles of NFKB
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Nelson et al. (2004) concluded
that the functional consequences of NFKB signaling may thus depend on
number, period, and amplitude of oscillations.

Barken et al. (2005) commented on the paper by Nelson et al. (2004),
suggesting that altering expression levels of fluorescently-tagged
signal proteins can severely affect the dynamic behavior of the
signaling pathway under study and cautioning against equating the
signaling behavior of genetically engineered cells with that of normal
cells. In response to the comment by Barken et al. (2005), Nelson et al.
(2005) stated that their experimental data showed no correlation between
NF-kappa-B (RelA) expression level and oscillation dynamics. Nelson et
al. (2005) showed that a small change to the computational model used by
Barken et al. (2005) to generate their theoretical data reduced the
apparent discrepancies. Cell system differences and possible
compensatory changes to normal signaling in their genetically knockout
cells may explain differences between the 2 studies.

Liu et al. (2006) showed that preexisting nuclear RELA positively
regulates ultraviolet (UV) irradiation-induced activation of JNK (MAPK8;
601158). In UV-irradiated mouse fibroblasts, they found that Pkc-delta
(176977) was required for Rela to activate Jnk, thereby contributing to
UV-induced apoptosis.

By genomewide mapping of RELA-bound loci in lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-stimulated monocytes, together with global gene expression
profiling, Lim et al. (2007) identified an overrepresentation of the
E2F1 (189971)-binding motif among RELA-bound loci associated with NFKB
target genes. Knockdown of endogenous E2F1 impaired the LPS inducibility
of the proinflammatory cytokines CCL3 (182283), IL23A (605580), TNF, and
IL1B. Sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation and coimmunoprecipitation
analysis showed that E2F1 existed as a complex with p50/RELA in
LPS-stimulated monocytes. Lim et al. (2007) concluded that NFKB recruits
E2F1 to positively regulate a spectrum of NFKB target genes.

Using knockdown, transfection, and protein interaction experiments with
human cell lines and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Mao et al. (2009)
showed that a complex of COMMD1 (607238), GCN5 (KAT2A; 602301), and CUL2
(603135) mediated ubiquitination of RELA, an event required for proper
termination of RELA-promoter interactions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
experiments showed that COMMD1 or GCN5 deficiency prolonged promoter
occupancy by RELA. IKK-dependent phosphorylation of RELA on ser468
enhanced binding of GCN5 to RELA and RELA ubiquitination.

GENE STRUCTURE

Deloukas and van Loon (1993) determined the complete genomic structure
of the human gene and a partial structure of the mouse gene encoding
p65. The human gene consists of 10 exons and spans about 8.1 kb of DNA.
A surprisingly high degree of conservation of intronic sequences was
observed between the species. Variants generated by alternative splicing
of intron 6 were observed in both species and the existence of another
as yet unknown splice variant of p65 was predicted.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Mathew et al. (1993)
demonstrated that the NFKB3 gene is located on 11q13. Using a YAC
containing the entire NFKB3 gene and FISH, Deloukas et al. (1994) found
2 sites of hybridization, 11q12 and Xp11.4, for sequences present in the
YAC. The NFKB3 gene was assigned to 11q12 by PCR analysis of a panel of
relevant hybrid cell lines.

ANIMAL MODEL

Beg et al. (1995) made a transgenic knockout mouse line for RelA and
showed that loss of the protein led to embryonic lethality at 15-16 days
of gestation as a result of massive degeneration of the liver due to
apoptosis.

Neurath et al. (1996) reported direct evidence for the involvement of
p65 in chronic intestinal inflammation induced in mice and suggested a
potential molecular therapeutic approach to the treatment of patients
with Crohn disease (see 266600) using p65 antisense oligonucleotides.

In order to study the effect of Rela deficiency on mouse skin, Zhang et
al. (2004) harvested Rela -/- embryo skin prior to embryonic lethality
around embryonic day 15.5 and grafted it onto immune-deficient mice.
Histologic examination revealed that Rela deficiency led to epidermal
hyperplasia and moderately increased cell size. The granular and
cornified layers appeared normal, and there was no inflammatory cell
infiltration. Rela -/- keratinocytes exhibited enhanced proliferation in
culture. Tnfr1 (191190)-dependent Jnk (601158) activation occurred in
Rela -/- epidermis, and Jnk inhibition abolished hyperproliferation due
to Rela deficiency. Furthermore, the hyperproliferation of
Rela-deficient skin was completely reversed in Rela-Tnfr1
double-knockout skin. Zhang et al. (2004) concluded that RELA
antagonizes TNFR1-JNK proliferative signals in epidermis and plays a
nonredundant role in restraining epidermal growth.

Gugasyan et al. (2004) found that mutant mice lacking both c-rel and
RelA displayed multiple epidermal defects, including thin epidermis and
failure to form tylotrich hair. Although mutant keratinocytes underwent
terminal differentiation, mutant basal keratinocytes were abnormally
small, showed growth delay, and failed to form colonies in culture. The
findings indicated that c-rel and RelA regulate skin development in a
redundant manner and that both are required for normal epidermal
development in mice.

601515	TITLE *601515 FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR 14; FGF14
;;FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR HOMOLOGOUS FACTOR 4; FHF4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FGF14 belongs to a subclass of fibroblast growth factors that are
expressed in the developing and adult central nervous system (Smallwood
et al., 1996). For a discussion on the FGF gene family, see FGF12
(601513).

CLONING

Smallwood et al. (1996) identified and characterized 4 novel members of
the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, including FGF14, which they
called FHF4. The genes were identified by a combination of random cDNA
sequencing, database searches, and degenerate PCR.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2000) characterized 2 mouse isoforms of Fgf14, which they
called Fgf14-1a and Fgf14-1b, resulting from alternative first exons. In
situ hybridization showed that Fgf14 is widely expressed in mouse brain,
spinal cord, major arteries, and thymus between embryonic days 12.5 and
14.5. In mouse cerebellar development, Fgf14 was first observed at
postnatal day 1 in postmitotic granule cells and later in migrating and
postmigratory granule cells. The Fgf14 expression pattern in cerebellum
was complementary to that of Math1 (ATOH1; 601461), a marker for
proliferating granule cells in the external germinal layer.

MAPPING

By Southern blot hybridization of genomic DNA from rodent/human hybrid
cell lines carrying individual human chromosomes, Smallwood et al.
(1996) mapped the FGF14 gene to chromosome 13. Using an interspecific
backcross mapping panel, they mapped the mouse homolog to chromosome 14,
very close to the Rap2a (179540) gene, which in the human maps to 13q34.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large 3-generation Dutch family with early-onset tremor,
dyskinesia, and slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia (SCA27; 609307),
van Swieten et al. (2003) found a phe145-to-ser mutation in the FGF14
gene (F145S; 601515.0001). The disorder was consistent with the
occurrence of ataxia and paroxysmal dyskinesia in Fgf14 knockout mice
(Wang et al., 2002).

In 1 of 208 unrelated patients with familial ataxia, Dalski et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion in the FGF14 gene
(601515.0002). The patient had early onset of the disorder and mild
mental retardation.

ANIMAL MODEL

To study the role of Fgf14 in CNS development and adult brain function,
Wang et al. (2002) generated Fgf14-deficient mice that expressed an
FGF14/beta-galactosidase fusion protein in place of the normal Fgf14
protein. The Fgf14-deficient mice were viable, fertile, and anatomically
normal, but developed ataxia and a paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement
disorder. The authors noted that the motor abnormalities are associated
with dysfunction of the basal ganglia system and resemble several human
dystonia syndromes. Using neuropharmacologic studies, Wang et al. (2002)
showed that the Fgf14-deficient mice had reduced responses to dopamine
agonists. They suggested a function for Fgf14 in neuronal signaling,
axonal trafficking, and synaptosomal function.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 27
FGF14, PHE145SER

In affected members of a 3-generation Dutch family with autosomal
dominant spinocerebellar ataxia-27 (609307), van Swieten et al. (2003)
identified a phe145-to-ser (F145S) mutation in the FGF14 gene. As
indicated by protein modeling, the amino acid change was predicted to
reduce the stability of the protein.

.0002
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 27
FGF14, 1-BP DEL, 487A

In a patient with spinocerebellar ataxia-27 (609307), Dalski et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (487delA) in exon 4 of
the FGF14 gene, resulting in premature termination of the protein and
loss of one-third of amino acid residues. The mutation was not
identified in 208 control samples. The patient had early onset of the
disorder and mild mental retardation.

609390	TITLE *609390 FIG4, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; FIG4
;;SAC DOMAIN-CONTAINING INOSITOL PHOSPHATASE 3; SAC3;;
KIAA0274
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The content of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) in
endosomal membranes changes dynamically with fission and fusion events
that generate or absorb intracellular transport vesicles. FIG4 is a
PtdIns(3,5)P2 5-phosphatase that functions in a trimolecular complex
that tightly regulates the level of PtdIns(3,5)P2. Other components of
this complex are the PtdIns(3,5)P2-synthesizing enzyme PIKFYVE (609414)
and its activator, VAC14 (604632) (Sbrissa et al., 2007).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned full-length FIG4, which they called
KIAA0274. The deduced protein contains 907 amino acids. Northern blot
analysis detected expression in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in testis.

Sbrissa et al. (2007) stated that the full-length 907-amino acid SAC3
protein contains an N-terminal SAC phosphatase domain of about 400 amino
acids. SAC3 also has multiple sites for serine/threonine and tyrosine
phosphorylation and numerous motifs for interaction with intracellular
transport and sorting molecules. Western blot analysis of HEK293 human
embryonic kidney cells and other mammalian cell lines detected SAC3 at
an apparent molecular mass of 97 kD. The presence of a broad band
suggested posttranslational modification of the protein. Fractionation
of HEK293 cells showed that SAC3 associated with both cytosol and
membranes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chow et al. (2007) determined that the human FIG4 gene comprises 23
coding exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the KIAA0274
gene to chromosome 6. Chow et al. (2007) localized the gene to
chromosome 6q21.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Sbrissa et al. (2007) showed that
endogenous SAC3, PIKFYVE, and ARPIKFYVE (VAC14) formed a stable ternary
complex in HEK293 cells and other mammalian cell lines.
Immunoprecipitated epitope-tagged SAC3 hydrolyzed the D5 phosphate from
PtdIns(4,5)P2, PtdIns(3,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, but it did not use
PtdIns(5)P or other PtdIns substrates. Mutation analysis showed that
asp488 was required for SAC3 phosphatase activity. Overexpression of
SAC3 in HEK293 cells did not produce an obvious morphologic phenotype,
but it rendered cells prone to developing dilated intracellular
membranes, consistent with perturbation of membrane PtdIns(3,5)P2
levels. In contrast, depletion of SAC3 via small interfering RNA
enhanced endosome carrier vesicles/multivesicular body formation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease 4J

In 4 unrelated patients with autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease type 4J (CMT4J; 611228), Chow et al. (2007) identified compound
heterozygous mutations in the FIG4 gene (609390.0001-609390.0005).

- Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 11

In 5 unrelated patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS11;
612577), Chow et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a missense, 2
splice site, and 2 truncating mutations in the FIG4 gene (see, e.g.,
609390.0006-609390.0008). The mutations were shown to result in complete
or significant loss of protein function. Five different missense FIG4
mutations were identified in 5 patients with a diagnosis of ALS or
adult-onset primary lateral sclerosis (PLSA1; 611637), but these
mutations were not clearly shown to be pathogenic.

- Yunis-Varon Syndrome

In 5 patients from 3 unrelated families with Yunis-Varon syndrome (YVS;
216340), Campeau et al. (2013) identified homozygous or compound
heterozygous mutations in the FIG4 gene (609390.0009-609390.0012). The
phenotype was severe, characterized by cleidocranial dysplasia, digital
anomalies, hypotonia, dysmorphic facial features, and severe neurologic
involvement, all apparent from birth. Most patients died in infancy.
Tissue samples showed enlarged cytoplasmic vacuoles. All the mutations,
which were found by exome sequencing, resulted in complete loss of
protein function, which Campeau et al. (2013) suggested resulted in a
more severe phenotype than that observed in CMT4J; the latter disorder
is associated with at least 1 missense hypomorphic mutation in the FIG4
gene. The report demonstrated that absence of FIG4 activity leads to
central nervous system dysfunction and extensive skeletal anomalies,
which suggested a role for PI(3,5)P2 signaling in skeletal development
and maintenance.

ANIMAL MODEL

The phenotype of the 'pale tremor' (plt) mouse, identified by Chow et
al. (2007), is characterized by a multi-organ disorder with neuronal
degeneration in the central nervous system, peripheral neuronopathy, and
diluted pigmentation. Positional cloning identified insertion of
ETn2-beta (early transposon 2-beta) into intron 18 of the mouse Fig4
gene, the homolog of a yeast suppressor of actin (SAC) domain
phosphatidylinositol(3,5)P(2)5-phosphatase located in the vacuolar
membrane. The abnormal concentration of
phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate in cultured fibroblasts from pale
tremor mice demonstrated the conserved biochemical function of mammalian
Fig4. The cytoplasm of fibroblasts from pale tremor mice was filled with
large vacuoles that were immunoreactive for Lamp2 (309060), consistent
with dysfunction of the late endosome-lysosome axis. Neonatal
neurodegeneration in sensory and autonomic ganglia was followed by loss
of neurons from layers 4 and 5 of the cortex, deep cerebellar nuclei,
and other localized brain regions. The sciatic nerve exhibited reduced
numbers of large-diameter myelinated axons, slowed nerve conduction
velocity, and reduced amplitude of compound muscle action potentials.

Mutations affecting the conversion of PI3P to the signaling lipid
PI(3,5)P2 result in spongiform degeneration of mouse brain and are
associated with the human disorders Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Ferguson et al. (2009) reported
accumulation of the proteins Lc3II (MAP1LC3A; 601242), p62 (SQSTM1;
601530), and Lamp2 in neurons and astrocytes of mice with mutations in 2
components of the PI(3,5)P2 regulatory complex, Fig4 and Vac14 (604632).
Cytoplasmic inclusion bodies containing p62 and ubiquitinated proteins
were present in regions of the mutant brain that underwent degeneration.
Colocalization of p62 and LAMP2 in affected cells indicated that
formation or recycling of the autolysosome may be impaired. The authors
proposed a role for PI(3,5)P2 in autophagy in the mammalian central
nervous system and demonstrated that mutations affecting PI(3,5)P2 may
contribute to inclusion body disease.

In patient fibroblasts, cell culture, and transgenic mice, Lenk et al.
(2011) demonstrated that the I41T mutant protein (609390.0001) is
unstable, resulting in low levels of FIG4. Low levels of the protein
resulted from impaired interaction with VAC14, which stabilizes FIG4.
Overexpression of mutant I41T in Fig4-null mice to 10% of wildtype
levels rescued the severe neurodegenerative phenotype, whereas lesser
overexpression (2-fold) resulted in partial rescue and a CMT-like
phenotype. The abundance of the I41T protein in cultured cells could be
increased by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor. The findings
indicated that I41T is a hypomorphic allele and suggested that
increasing expression of the I41T mutant allele in CMT4J patients with
the mutation may be therapeutic.

In mouse tissue, Campeau et al. (2013) found that Fig4 expression in
calvaria, osteoblasts, and bone marrow cells was comparable to its
expression in brain. Fig4-null mice showed a smaller skeleton than
wildtype mice at day P21, with smaller long bones, clavicles, and pelvic
bones. Although the shapes of the bones were similar to wildtype,
Fig4-null mouse bones had significantly lower (50%) trabecular and
cortical density, bone volume fraction, bone surface, trabecular number,
and connectivity density, consistent with abnormal ossification.
Cultures of isolated osteoblasts from calvarial tissue showed extensive
vacuolization. Fig4-null mice did not exhibit aplasia or hypoplasia of
digits on the front or rear limbs.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 4J
FIG4, ILE41THR

In 4 unrelated patients with severe early-onset autosomal recessive
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT4J; 611228), Chow et al. (2007) found
the same mutation in the FIG4 gene, a T-to-C transition at nucleotide
122 resulting in an ile-to-thr substitution at codon 41 (I41T). The
mutation occurred in compound heterozygosity in each patient with 1 of 4
other FIG4 mutations. The 4 patients carried I41T on the same 15-kb
haplotype, defined by 3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
consistent with inheritance of a common ancestral mutant allele. The
isoleucine at codon 41 is invariant from human to yeast.

In patient fibroblasts, cell culture, and transgenic mice, Lenk et al.
(2011) demonstrated that the I41T mutant protein is unstable, resulting
in low levels of FIG4. Low levels of the protein resulted from impaired
interaction with VAC14 (604362), which stabilizes FIG4. Overexpression
of mutant I41T in Fig4-null mice to 10% of wildtype levels rescued the
neurodegenerative phenotype. The abundance of the I41T protein in
cultured cells could be increased by treatment with a proteasome
inhibitor. The findings indicated that I41T is a hypomorphic allele and
suggested that increasing expression of the I41T mutant allele in
patients with the mutation may be therapeutic.

.0002
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 4J
FIG4, 1-BP DEL, 294T

In a patient with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J (611228), Chow et
al. (2007) identified a single-basepair deletion, of thymidine, at
nucleotide 294 of the FIG4 gene, resulting in frameshift and premature
termination of the protein (F98fsX102). The patient was compound
heterozygous for the I41T allele (609390.0001).

.0003
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 4J
FIG4, ARG183TER

In a patient and her sib with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J
(611228), Chow et al. (2007) found compound heterozygosity for a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 718 of the FIG4 gene, resulting in an
arg-to-ter substitution at codon 183 (R183X), and the I41T mutation
(609390.0001). Both sibs had severe disease. The proband was a
functional quadriplegic, and her sib was wheelchair-bound with normal
use of his arms. Both had slow nerve conduction velocities. A sural
nerve biopsy from the proband demonstrated profound axonal loss, thinly
myelinated nerve fibers, and evidence of de- and remyelination.

.0004
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 4J
FIG4, 8-BP DEL, NT1043

In a patient with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J (611228), Chow et
al. (2007) found compound heterozygosity for the I41T mutation in FIG4
(609390.0001) and an 8-basepair deletion, of ATCAGGCA, starting at
nucleotide position 1043 (D348fsX359).

.0005
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 4J
FIG4, 1-BP DEL, 759G

In a patient with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J (611228), Chow et
al. (2007) found a single-basepair deletion of a guanine at position 759
of the FIG4 gene, resulting in a frameshift and early termination
(G253fsX261). The patient carried this mutation in compound
heterozygosity with the I41T mutation (609390.0001).

.0006
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS 11
FIG4, ARG183TER

In a man with probable ALS11 (612577), Chow et al. (2009) identified a
heterozygous 547C-T transition in exon 6 of the FIG4 gene, resulting in
an arg183-to-ter (R183X) substitution, predicted to result in loss of
phosphatase activity. He had onset at age 62 and presented with bulbar
signs. He had prominent cortical spinal tract findings and moderate
lower motor neuron findings. EMG showed mild denervation of 3
extremities.

.0007
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS 11
FIG4, IVS11DS, G-T, +5

In a woman with definite ALS11 (612577), Chow et al. (2009) identified a
heterozygous G-to-T transversion in intron 11 (1386+5G-T) of the FIG4
gene, predicted to result in the skipping of exon 12 or premature
termination. She had onset at age 57 and presented with involvement of
the upper extremity. She had both upper and lower motor neuron signs and
acute and chronic denervation on EMG.

.0008
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS 11
FIG4, ASP53TYR

In a woman with definite ALS11 (612577), Chow et al. (2009) identified a
heterozygous 157G-T transversion in exon 2 of the FIG4 gene, resulting
in an asp53-to-tyr (D53Y) substitution. In vitro functional expression
studies in yeast showed that the mutant protein had significantly less
activity compared to wildtype. The patient presented at age 56 with
bulbar signs. She had moderate corticospinal findings, and autopsy
showed lower motor neuron loss.

.0009
YUNIS-VARON SYNDROME
FIG4, 2-BP DEL, 1260GT

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Mexican parents, with Yunis-Varon
syndrome (YVS; 216340), who had been reported by Corona-Rivera et al.
(2011), Campeau et al. (2013) identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion
(c.1260_1261delGT) in exon 11 of the FIG4 gene, resulting in a
frameshift and premature termination (Thr422GlnfsTer6) predicted to
cause protein truncation upstream of the phosphatase catalytic motif and
complete loss of function. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous fort
the mutation, which was found by exome sequencing.

.0010
YUNIS-VARON SYNDROME
FIG4, GLY104ASP

In 2 sibs, born of unrelated English parents, with Yunis-Varon syndrome
(216340), who had been reported by Garrett et al. (1990), Campeau et al.
(2013) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the FIG4 gene: a
c.311G-A transition in exon 4, resulting in a gly104-to-asp (G104D)
substitution at a highly conserved residue located at the beginning of
beta-sheet 7 in the noncatalytic, protein-binding domain of FIG4, and an
8-bp deletion (c.831_838delTAAATTTG; 609390.0011) in exon 8, resulting
in a frameshift and premature termination (Lys278TrpfsTer6). Each
unaffected parent carried 1 of the mutations, which were found by exome
sequencing. Transfection of the G104D mutation in cultured fibroblasts
from the Fig4-null mouse failed to correct cytoplasmic vacuolization,
consistent with complete loss of function.

.0011
YUNIS-VARON SYNDROME
FIG4, 8-BP DEL, NT831

See 609390.0010 and Campeau et al. (2013).

.0012
YUNIS-VARON SYNDROME
FIG4, LEU175PRO

In an Italian girl, born of unrelated parents, with Yunis-Varon syndrome
(216340), who had been described by Dworzak et al. (1995), Campeau et
al. (2013) identified a homozygous c.524T-C transition in exon 6 of the
FIG4 gene, resulting in a leu175-to-pro (L175P) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in alpha-helix 2 of a noncatalytic, protein-binding
domain of FIG4. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the
mutation, which was found by exome sequencing. Transfection of the
mutation in cultured fibroblasts from the Fig4-null mouse failed to
correct cytoplasmic vacuolization, consistent with complete loss of
function.

609683	TITLE *609683 DNA CROSS-LINK REPAIR PROTEIN 1B; DCLRE1B
;;SNM1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, B; SNM1B;;
APOLLO
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNA interstrand cross-links prevent strand separation, thereby
physically blocking transcription, replication, and segregation of DNA.
DCLRE1B is one of several evolutionarily conserved genes involved in
repair of interstrand cross-links (Dronkert et al., 2000).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to S. cerevisiae Pso2/Snm1
and human SNM1 (DCLRE1A; 609682), Dronkert et al. (2000) identified
partial clones encoding mouse and human DCLRE1B, which they called
SNM1B. The human and mouse SNM1B proteins share high similarity with one
another, but less similarity with S. cerevisiae Snm1.

By searching databases using the partial SNM1B sequence obtained by
Dronkert et al. (2000) as query, Demuth et al. (2004) identified
full-length SNM1B clones. The deduced protein contains 532 amino acids
and shares similarity with S. cerevisiae Pso2 only in its N terminus.
Demuth et al. (2004) also identified a rare SNM1B transcript lacking
exon 2 that may encode smaller proteins without the N-terminal Pso2
homology domain. RT-PCR detected SNM1B expression in HeLa cells, but
protein levels were below the level of detection by Western blot
analysis.

Lenain et al. (2006) reported that the deduced 532-amino acid SNM1B
protein has an N-terminal beta-lactamase (LACTB; 608440) domain and a
central beta-CASP domain. Because SNM1B shares higher sequence
similarity with Artemis (DCLRE1C; 605988) than with SNM1A, Lenain et al.
(2006) named it Apollo, after the twin brother of Artemis in Greek
mythology.

GENE FUNCTION

Mutation in the yeast Pso2 gene confers sensitivity to interstrand
cross-linking agents. Demuth et al. (2004) found that depletion of HeLa
cell SNM1B by small interfering RNA conferred sensitivity to mitomycin
C, cisplatin, and ionizing radiation. SNM1B-depleted cells showed an
elevated rate of chromosome breakage. Demuth et al. (2004) concluded
that SNM1B may be involved in homologous recombination repair of
double-strand breaks arising as intermediates during repair of
interstrand cross-links.

Lenain et al. (2006) showed that purified human Apollo exhibited
5-prime-to-3-prime DNA exonuclease activity against single- and
double-stranded DNA, but not against DNA substrates with telomeric
sequences. Apollo did not show endonuclease activity. Yeast 2-hybrid and
protein pull-down assays showed that the N terminus of Apollo bound TRF2
(TERF2; 602027), another beta-CASP metallo-beta-lactamase family member.
DNA was not required for the Apollo-TRF2 interaction. Apollo
preferentially localized to telomeres in a TRF2-dependent manner.
Knockdown of Apollo in HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells exacerbated
sensitivity to TRF2 inhibition and resulted in severe growth defects,
increased number of telomere-induced DNA-damage foci, and telomere
fusion.

The 6-protein mammalian telomere protection complex shelterin contains
the closely related proteins TRF1 (600951) and TRF2, which recruit
various proteins to telomeres. Chen et al. (2008) showed that the TRF
homology domain docking site of TRF2 binds the shelterin accessory
factor Apollo, which does not interact with the TRF homology domain of
TRF1.

Ye et al. (2010) showed that TRF2 stimulated the exonuclease activity of
Apollo against single-stranded telomeric DNA, but not against
double-stranded substrates that mimicked telomeric DNA ends. Both
proteins bound an 800-bp telomeric sequence artificially integrated into
the middle of chromosome 4q. Mutation of catalytic residues in Apollo
revealed that its exonuclease activity was required to protect
telomerase (see 187270)-negative cells against accumulation of telomere
dysfunction-induced foci and cell senescence. Telomere deficiencies due
to inhibition or knockdown of TOP2-alpha (TOP2A; 126430) were rescued by
overexpression of Apollo and TRF2. Overexpression of Apollo and TRF2
reduced the requirement for TOP2-alpha for telomere replication. Ye et
al. (2010) found that TRF2 showed preferential binding to positively
supercoiled DNA. They hypothesized that TRF2-Apollo and TOP2 act in
concert to release positive superhelical strain created in telomeric DNA
during replication fork progression.

603847	TITLE *603847 NADH-UBIQUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE Fe-S PROTEIN 5; NDUFS5
;;COMPLEX I, MITOCHONDRIAL RESPIRATORY CHAIN, 15-KD SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION The multisubunit NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the first
enzyme complex in the electron transport chain of mitochondria. The
iron-sulfur protein (IP) fraction is made up of 7 subunits. See NDUFS1
(157655). By a combination of EST database searching and RT-PCR, Loeffen
et al. (1999) isolated cDNAs encoding the human homolog of the bovine
15-kD IP subunit. The predicted 106-amino acid human NDUFS5 protein
shares 75% homology with the bovine protein. Northern dot blot analysis
revealed that NDUFS5 was expressed in all human tissues tested. Mao et
al. (1998) identified an NDUFS5 cDNA, HD-CI-15, among a collection of
cDNAs expressed in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Loeffen et al. (1999) mapped the
NDUFS5 gene to chromosome 1. By radiation hybrid analysis, Emahazion et
al. (1998) mapped the NDUFS5 gene to 1p34.2-p33.

Smeitink and van den Heuvel (1999) reviewed the available molecular data
regarding the human nuclear-encoded complex I subunits.

609538	TITLE *609538 PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, MITOCHONDRIAL, 1; PTPMT1
;;PTEN-LIKE PHOSPHATASE; PLIP;;
PHOSPHOINOSITIDE LIPID PHOSPHATASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases using the phosphatase domain of PTEN (601728) as
query, Pagliarini et al. (2004) identified PTPMT1, which they called
PLIP. Database analysis using the mouse ortholog, which encodes a
deduced 261-amino acid protein, revealed 60 orthologs from 4 different
phylogenetic kingdoms that share more than 70% amino acid identity
within the active site region. The active site sequence between amino
acids 128 and 148 of mouse and human PLIP is identical. Northern blot
analysis of several mouse tissues detected highest expression in testis.
In addition to testis, RT-PCR detected expression in brain, liver,
skeletal muscle, and uterus, with low levels in all other tissues
examined.

Pagliarini et al. (2005) found that mouse Ptpmt1 was targeted to
mitochondria in transfected COS-1 cells. Targeting was determined by an
N-terminal signal sequence, and Ptpmt1 was anchored to the matrix face
of the inner membrane.

GENE FUNCTION

Pagliarini et al. (2004) found that recombinant mouse Plip showed highly
selective activity against phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate
(PtdIns(5)P), with a pH optimum at 5.5. Plip showed activity against
PtdIns(5)P that was 44-fold greater than that against PtdIns(3,5)P2, its
second most preferred substrate, when the phosphoinositides were
presented in a lipid bilayer with phosphatidylserine.

Pagliarini et al. (2005) found that knockdown of Ptpmt1 expression in a
rat pancreatic insulinoma cell line altered the mitochondrial
phosphoprotein profile and enhanced both ATP production and insulin
secretion.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PTPMT1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP RH47256).

606513	TITLE *606513 PROTEIN KINASE C AND CASEIN KINASE SUBSTRATE IN NEURONS 3; PACSIN3
DESCRIPTION PACSINs are a family of cytoplasmic phosphoproteins that play a role in
vesicle formation and transport.

CLONING

Howard et al. (1999) cloned a cDNA encoding PACSIN3, which they regarded
as the human ortholog of the chicken focal adhesion protein, Fap52.

Using murine cDNAs for Pacsin1 (606512) and Pacsin2 (604960) as probes
to search EST databases, Modregger et al. (2000) obtained cDNAs encoding
mouse and human PACSIN3. Sequence analysis predicted that the 424-amino
acid human PACSIN3 protein, which is 94% identical to the mouse protein,
has an N-terminal CDC15 domain and a conserved C-terminal SH3 domain
preceded by a proline-rich region. RNA dot blot analysis detected
PACSIN3 expression mainly in skeletal muscle, heart, lung, kidney,
adrenal gland, and placenta. Immunoblot analysis showed predominant
expression of a 48-kD protein in mouse lung, skeletal muscle, and heart;
expression was also detected in brain, kidney, and uterus.
Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated colocalization of PACSIN3
with dynamin (DNM1; 602377) on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma
membrane. GST pull-down analysis indicated binding to dynamin,
synaptojanin (SYNJ1; 604297), and N-WASP (WASL; 605056) through an
intact SH3 domain. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis established that all 3
PACSINs can form both homo- and heteroaggregates. Functional analysis
showed that overexpressed wildtype PACSINs, but not SH3-deleted PACSINs,
blocked the endocytosis of transferrin (TF; 190000).

Sumoy et al. (2001) also cloned cDNAs encoding PACSIN3. Northern blot
analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of a 2.2-kb PACSIN3 transcript,
with higher levels in heart and skeletal muscle. Immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated cytoplasmic expression but, unlike chicken
Fap52, no concentration at focal adhesions.

MAPPING

Sumoy et al. (2001) stated that the PACSIN3 gene maps to 11p11.

600616	TITLE *600616 LUMICAN; LUM
;;LDC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Lumican, a member of the small interstitial proteoglycan gene (SIPG)
family, is a keratan sulfate proteoglycan present in large quantities in
the corneal stroma and in interstitial collagenous matrices of the
heart, aorta, skeletal muscle, skin, and intervertebral discs
(Chakravarti and Magnuson, 1995). Other SIPG members are decorin
(125255), biglycan (301870), and fibromodulin (600245).

CLONING

Chakravarti et al. (1995) derived the primary structure of lumican from
cDNA sequencing of chicken, bovine, and human clones and demonstrated
that lumican shows all the characteristic features of the SIPG family,
namely, 4 and 2 cysteines in the N- and C-terminal globular domains, I
and III, and a central, cysteine-free domain II, with 9 beta
sheet-forming leucine motifs. This human core protein contains 4
putative N-glycosylation sites in the central domains, all or some of
which are substituted with keratan sulfate side chains. At the amino
acid level, it is 90% identical with the bovine and 72% identical with
the chicken core protein. By immunohistochemical staining, Chakravarti
et al. (1995) showed that lumican is present not only in the corneal
stroma but also in the dermal area of the skin.

Grover et al. (1995) used PCR techniques to derive a human lumican cDNA
sequence from RNA obtained from intestine, placenta, and articular
cartilage. The deduced lumican protein sequence had 338 amino acids,
including a putative 18-residue signal peptide. The lumican message is
expressed at high levels in adult articular chondrocytes, but at low
levels in the young juvenile. It is present in the extracellular matrix
of human articular cartilage at all ages, although its abundance is far
greater in the adult. In adult cartilage, lumican exists predominantly
in a glycoprotein form lacking keratan sulfate, whereas the juvenile
form of the molecule is a proteoglycan.

Yeh et al. (2010) found that zebrafish Lum existed as a keratan sulfate
proteoglycan in corneal stroma and as an unglycanated glycoprotein in
sclera.

GENE STRUCTURE

Grover et al. (1995) showed that the LDC gene is spread over about 7.5
kb of genomic DNA and consists of 3 exons separated by introns of 2.2
and 3.5 kb.

MAPPING

Chakravarti and Magnuson (1995) localized the mouse lumican gene to
distal chromosome 10 by segregation analysis of restriction fragment
length variants (RFLVs) in recombinant inbred (RI) strains of mice.

Chakravarti et al. (1995) localized the lumican gene to human chromosome
12 by hybridizing a cDNA probe to a Southern blot containing a
human/hamster monochromosomal mapping panel DNA. Sublocalization to
12q21.3-q22 was performed by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

By PCR analysis of human/hamster somatic cell hybrids Grover et al.
(1995) mapped the LDC gene to chromosome 12 and regionalized it to
chromosome 12q22 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Like decorin, lumican interacts with collagen and limits growth of
fibrils in diameter (Chakravarti and Magnuson, 1995). In the cornea,
lumican not only interacts with collagen molecules to limit fibril
growth, but by virtue of its keratan sulfate-containing
glycosaminoglycan side chains LDC plays a critical role in the regular
spacing of fibrils and acquisition of corneal transparency.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Association with Myopia

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the LUM
gene and myopia, see MYP3 (603221).

ANIMAL MODEL

Lumican and fibromodulin (600245) regulate the assembly of collagens
into higher-order fibrils in connective tissues. Jepsen et al. (2002)
showed that mice deficient in both of these proteoglycans manifest
several clinical features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (see 130000).
Double-null Lum -/- Fmod -/- mice were smaller than their wildtype
littermates and displayed gait abnormality, joint laxity, and
age-dependent osteoarthritis. Misaligned patellae, severe knee
dysmorphogenesis, and extreme tendon weakness were the likely causes for
joint laxity in the double-nulls. Fibromodulin deficiency alone led to
significant reduction in tendon stiffness, with further loss in
stiffness in a Lum gene dose-dependent way. At the protein level, Jepsen
et al. (2002) showed marked increase of lumican in Fmod -/- tendons,
which may partially rescue the tendon phenotype in this genotype. These
results established fibromodulin as a key regulator and lumican as a
modulator of tendon strength. A disproportionate increase in small
diameter immature collagen fibrils and a lack of progression to mature,
large diameter fibrils in the Fmod -/- background constitute the
underlying cause of tendon weakness and suggest that fibromodulin aids
fibril maturation. The study suggested that lumican and fibromodulin may
be key players in the pathogenesis of certain types of Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome and other connective tissue disorders.

Yeh et al. (2010) found that knockdown of zebrafish Lum by antisense
morpholinos resulted in ocular enlargement resembling axial myopia.
Mutant zebrafish also showed enlarged pericardium and deformed body
shape. Ocular enlargement was due to disruption of the collagen fibril
arrangement in the sclera and resulted in scleral thinning.
Administration of muscarinic receptor antagonists subdued ocular
enlargement.

604098	TITLE *604098 SUPPRESSOR OF G2 ALLELE OF SKP1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; SUGT1
;;SGT1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kitagawa et al. (1999) identified the S. cerevisiae SGT1 (suppressor of
G2 allele of SKP1) gene, which, like SKP1 (see 601434), is required for
both the G1/S and G2/M transitions in the cell cycle. The SGT1 protein
physically associates with the SKP1 protein and the SCF (SKP1/Cdc53/F
box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex (see 603134) and is required for
kinetochore function, where it serves as an activator of the Ctf13
protein. Kitagawa et al. (1999) also cloned the human homolog of the
yeast SGT1 gene. The yeast and human SGT1 proteins share 26% identity
and 30% similarity. Human SGT1 could perform the essential functions of
SGT1 in budding yeast, indicating that SGT1 function is conserved
throughout eukaryotes.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the SUGT1 gene to chromosome 13q14.3 based on an
alignment of the SUGT1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF132856) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

608057	TITLE *608057 DEOXYRIBONUCLEASE II BETA; DNASE2B
;;DNase II-BETA;;
DNASE2-LIKE ACID DNase; DLAD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DLAD is a cation-independent acid endonuclease that shares homology with
deoxyribonuclease II (DNASE2; 126350). Unlike DNASE2, however, DLAD
shows a restricted tissue distribution.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences sharing similarity with
DNASE2, followed by 3-prime RACE of salivary gland RNA, Krieser et al.
(2001) cloned full-length DLAD, which they called DNase II-beta. The
deduced 357-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal signal sequence, a
signal peptide cleavage site, and a conserved active site. It shares 37%
amino acid identity with DNASE2. Northern blot analysis of salivary
gland detected a 2.1-kb transcript. Expression array analysis detected
highest expression in salivary gland, followed by lung, prostate, and
lymph node. Weak expression was detected in trachea and testis, and no
expression was detected in any other tissue examined. Northern blot
analysis of mouse tissues detected expression of a 1.6-kb Dlad
transcript only in liver. By 5-prime RACE of lymphoid and lung cell line
RNA, Krieser et al. (2001) identified a DLAD sequence containing exon 1
of the inactive UOX pseudogene (191540), which is located in tandem with
DLAD on chromosome 1, within the 5-prime untranslated region. By
database analysis, they found DLAD homologs in all mammals examined and
in C. elegans and Drosophila.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to mouse Dlad,
followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of lung cDNA, Shiokawa and Tanuma
(2001) cloned DLAD. The deduced protein contains 153 amino acids and
includes a conserved active site histidine. Northern blot analysis of
several tissues detected a 1.1-kb transcript only in lung. By genomic
sequence analysis and PCR, Shiokawa and Tanuma (2001) identified a
longer DLAD variant that encodes a deduced 361-amino acid protein with 5
putative N-glycosylation sites. The longer DLAD sequence shares 63.2%
and 65.1% amino acid identity with mouse and rat Dlad, respectively.
Shiokawa and Tanuma (2001) determined that the lung-specific DLAD mRNA
is transcribed from intron 2 through exon 6.

GENE FUNCTION

Krieser et al. (2001) detected DNase activity at acidic pH in human
saliva following immunodepletion of DNASE2. They attributed the residual
activity to DLAD.

Shiokawa and Tanuma (2001) characterized affinity-purified recombinant
DLAD. They observed endonuclease activity over a broad pH range, with
maximum activity at pH 4.8 to 5.6. The activity was independent of
divalent cations and chelating agents.

Nishimoto et al. (2003) found that DLAD mRNA is highly expressed in the
mouse lens, with expression level in the lens about 10 times higher than
that in the liver. DLAD mRNA levels in the mouse lens were low at
embryonic day 14.5, but much increased at the late stage of mouse
embryogenesis. DLAD mRNA was detected in human lens cells from patients
with senile cataracts. An epithelial cell line established from human
lens also expressed a significant level of DLAD mRNA. Little expression
of DLAD mRNA was found in the other types of cell lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krieser et al. (2001) and Shiokawa and Tanuma (2001) determined that the
DLAD gene contains 6 exons and lies in a head-to-head orientation with
the inactive UOX pseudogene. Krieser et al. (2001) determined that the
DLAD gene spans about 16.3 kb, while Shiokawa and Tanuma (2001)
determined that it spans about 18 kb. Shiokawa and Tanuma (2001) found
that the promoter region of the mouse Dlad gene contains no canonical
TATA or CAAT boxes.

MAPPING

By FISH, Krieser et al. (2001) mapped the DLAD gene to chromosome
1p22.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nishimoto et al. (2003) generated Dlad-null mice by gene targeting.
Their targeting vector deleted exons 3 and 4, as confirmed by Southern
hybridization, Northern blot analysis, and RT-PCR. Dlad-null mice were
born at the expected mendelian frequency, showed no gross developmental
abnormality other than cataract, and were fertile. The eyeballs of
Dlad-null mice were of normal morphology, with well-differentiated
mature lens fiber cells. Mature lens fiber cells did not contain
endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria; however, undigested DNA was
identified in the epithelial layer and the nucleus. Newborn Dlad-null
mice showed weak but recognizable cataract that was enhanced with age.
Nishimoto et al. (2003) concluded that DLAD is responsible for the
degradation of nuclear DNA during lens cell differentiation and that if
DNA is left undigested in the lens, it causes cataracts of the nucleus
lentis, blocking the light path.

;;TANKYRASE 2; TANK2;;
TNKL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the adaptor protein GRB14 (601524) in a yeast 2-hybrid screen,
Lyons et al. (2001) identified a partial TNKS2 clone within a human
liver cDNA library. They generated the full-length sequence by isolation
of a series of overlapping clones. The deduced 1,166-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of 130 kD. It shares approximately 83%
sequence identity with tankyrase-1 (TNKS; 603303), differing mainly in
the absence of a histidine/proline/serine-rich (HPS) domain. Both
proteins possess 24 ankyrin-type repeats, a sterile alpha motif, and a
C-terminal poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) homology domain. Critical
residues required for NAD+ binding and catalysis are entirely conserved.
Northern blot analysis detected strong expression of a 7-kb transcript
in skeletal muscle and placenta and moderate expression in leukocytes,
small intestine, ovary, testis, prostate, thymus, spleen, and pancreas.
Western blot analysis of prostate carcinoma cells revealed a protein
with an apparent molecular mass of 130 kD. Fractionation of a fibroblast
cell line followed by Western blot analysis revealed both TNKS2 and TNKS
in the low density microsome fraction. Confocal microscopy demonstrated
both diffuse and punctate cytoplasmic staining for TNKS2, with some
overlap with GRB14.

Using the telomeric repeat-binding factor-1 (TRF1; 600951) as probe,
Kaminker et al. (2001) isolated a partial TNKS2 cDNA in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a fibroblast library and attained the full-length clone by
5-prime RACE. The human and mouse TNKS2 proteins share 96% sequence
identity. In place of the HPS domain in TNKS, human TNKS2 contains a
unique 25-amino acid N-terminal domain. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous expression of a 6.6-kb transcript, at varying levels. TNKS2
was found in an insoluble fraction when cells were extracted under
nondenaturing conditions, suggesting that the protein associates with
insoluble nuclear or cytoskeletal matrices. In mitotic cells, TNKS2
localized to the pericentriolar matrix.

GENE FUNCTION

Using deletion analysis with a yeast 2-hybrid binding assay, Lyons et
al. (2001) determined that the N-terminal set of ankyrin repeats in
TNKS2 interacts with the N terminus of GRB14. By coimmunoprecipitation
experiments, they confirmed interaction between TNKS2 and GRB14 in
transfected HEK293 cells.

By coimmunoprecipitation and binding studies of in vitro translated
protein, Kaminker et al. (2001) verified TRF1/TNKS2 interaction and
localized the site of interaction to a 52-amino acid N-terminal domain
of TRF1. They also found that overexpression of TNKS2 is cytotoxic,
causing loss of mitochondrial membrane potential within 7 hours of
transfection. Addition of a PARP inhibitor partially protected cells
from TNKS2 toxicity.

In an immunoscreen of novel antigens associated with meningioma, Monz et
al. (2001) found that sera of patients with the most common types of
meningioma recognized TNKS2. Northern blot analysis demonstrated
expression of TNKS2 in 2 common-type meningiomas from patients with
immune response, but Monz et al. (2001) were unable to correlate
expression of TNKS2 to the immune response.

To investigate a role for TNKS2 at telomeres, Cook et al. (2002)
subjected TNKS2 to an in vitro PARP assay. TNKS2 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated
itself and TRF1. Overexpression of TNKS2 in the nucleus released
endogenous TRF1 from telomeres. These findings established TNKS2 as a
bona fide PARP, with itself and TRF1 as acceptors of ADP-ribosylation,
and suggested the possibility of a role for TNKS2 at telomeres. Using
Northern blot analysis, Cook et al. (2002) detected TNKS2 expression
nearly ubiquitously in human adult and fetal tissues, in HeLa cells, and
in primary fibroblasts.

Sbodio et al. (2002) showed that tankyrase-2 contains intrinsic PARP
activity and, like tankyrase-1, binds to both TRF1 and IRAP (151300).
Intrinsic PARP activity of tankyrase-2 depends critically on the met1054
residue. Sequence analysis suggested that the ANK domain of tankyrases
comprises 5 subdomains, each consisting of 4 ANK repeats and demarcated
from its adjacent subdomain by an LLEAAR-containing insert, that provide
redundant binding sites for IRAP. Moreover, tankyrase-2 associates and
colocalizes with tankyrase-1, suggesting that both tankyrases might
function as a complex. Taken together, the findings of Sbodio et al.
(2002) indicated that tankyrase-1 and tankyrase-2 interact with the same
set of proteins and probably mediate overlapping functions, both at
telomeres and in vesicular compartments.

To examine whether tumors overexpress tankyrase-2, Sidorova et al.
(2006) raised anti-TNKL antibodies that did not cross-react with
tankyrase-1. Of 18 breast tumor sections, 2 were positive for TNKL.
Others were negative or contained barely detectable protein. Surrounding
normal tissues were negative. Immunostaining with anti-TNKL antibody
revealed expression of TNKL protein in epithelial cells of a limited
number of normal renal tubules, whereas other renal tubules were
negative. These data suggested that TNKL is not expressed ubiquitously
in human tissues. To determine whether the upregulation of TNKL is
associated with tissue regeneration and cell proliferation, Sidorova et
al. (2006) compared the activity and concentration of the enzyme in a
model HEK293 cell line arrested by serum deprivation and restimulated
with serum. The serum-starved quiescent cell culture exhibited
detectable protein as did the proliferating cells; enzyme activity
dramatically increased in the latter. Sidorova et al. (2006) concluded
that pathologic overexpression of TNKL in some tumors may be the result
of the cancer-related adaptation of the malignant cells dependent on
tankyrase activity. Under normal conditions, the protein might be
upregulated during cell differentiation and also posttranslationally in
proliferating cells.

Huang et al. (2009) used a chemical genetic screen to identify a small
molecule, XAV939, which selectively inhibits beta-catenin
(116806)-mediated transcription. XAV939 stimulates beta-catenin
degradation by stabilizing axin (603816), the concentration-limiting
component of the destruction complex. Using a quantitative chemical
proteomic approach, Huang et al. (2009) found that XAV939 stabilizes
axin by inhibiting the poly-ADP-ribosylating enzymes tankyrase-1
(603303) and tankyrase-2. Both tankyrase isoforms interact with a highly
conserved domain of axin and stimulate its degradation through the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kaminker et al. (2001) determined that the TNKS2 gene contains 27 exons
and spans about 66 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Lyons et al. (2001) mapped the TNKS2 gene to chromosome
10q23.2. Kaminker et al. (2001) mapped the TNKS2 gene to chromosome
10q23-q24 by FISH and refined the localization to 10q23.3 by radiation
hybrid analysis.

;;PROTEIN KINASE, INTERFERON-INDUCIBLE DOUBLE-STRANDED RNA-ACTIVATED;
PRKR;;

p68 KINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

EIF2AK2 is a protein serine/threonine kinase that acquires enzymatic
activity following autophosphorylation, a process mediated by
double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Activation of EIF2AK2 allows the kinase to
phosphorylate its natural substrate, the alpha subunit of eukaryotic
protein synthesis initiation factor-2 (EIF2-alpha; 603907), leading to
the inhibition of protein synthesis (summary by Kuhen et al., 1996).

CLONING

Meurs et al. (1990) cloned EIF2AK2, which encodes a 550-amino acid
protein with a predicted molecular mass of 62 kD. Immunoblot assay of
interferon-treated human Daudi and murine L929 cells identified a 68-kD
protein in human cells and a 65-kD protein in mouse cells. Transcription
of EIF2AK2 was induced following exposure to interferon (IFNG; 147570)
in a dose-dependent manner and was not affected by inhibition of protein
synthesis.

Kuhen et al. (1996) isolated the EIF2AK2 gene, which they called PKR, as
lambda phage and P1 phage clones from a human genomic library, and
compared the structural organization of the mouse and human genes. The
human and mouse proteins shared approximately 60% amino acid identity.
Kuhen et al. (1996) determined the nucleotide sequence of the human
EIF2AK2 gene, which encodes a 551-amino acid protein.

Jeon et al. (2012) reported that PKR contains 2 N-terminal dsRNA-
binding motifs and a long C-terminal kinase domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kuhen et al. (1996) determined that the EIF2AK2 gene contains 17 exons
and spans approximately 50 kb.

MAPPING

Barber et al. (1993) mapped the EIF2AK2 gene to chromosome 2p21 by in
situ hybridization. The corresponding mouse gene was mapped to
chromosome 17 (band E2) by the same method. By FISH analysis, Squire et
al. (1993) assigned the EIF2AK2 gene to the boundary between chromosome
2p22-p21.

GENE FUNCTION

Ben-Asouli et al. (2002) showed that human gamma-interferon mRNA uses
local activation of PKR in the cell to control its own translation
yield. IFNG mRNA was found to activate PKR through a pseudoknot in its
5-prime untranslated region. Mutations that impaired pseudoknot
stability reduced the ability to activate PKR and strongly increased the
translation efficiency of IFNG mRNA. Nonphosphorylatable mutant
eIF2-alpha (eIF2A; 609234), knockout of PKR, and the PKR inhibitors
2-aminopurine, transdominant-negative PKR, or vaccinia E3L
correspondingly enhanced translation of IFNG mRNA. The potential to form
the pseudoknot was found to be phylogenetically conserved. Ben-Asouli et
al. (2002) proposed that the RNA pseudoknot acts to adjust translation
of IFNG mRNA to the PKR level expressed in the cell.

Taylor et al. (1999) studied the mechanism underlying the resistance of
hepatitis C virus (HCV) to interferon. They demonstrated that the HCV
envelope protein E2 contains a sequence identical with phosphorylation
sites of the interferon-inducible protein kinase PKR and the translation
initiation factor EIF2-alpha, a target of PKR. E2 inhibited the kinase
activity of PKR and blocked its inhibitory effect on protein synthesis
and cell growth. This interaction of E2 in PKR may be one mechanism by
which HCV circumvents the antiviral effect of interferon. Taylor et al.
(1999) hypothesized that another potential outcome of PKR inhibition is
the promotion of cell growth which may contribute to HCV-associated
hepatocellular carcinoma.

Huntington disease (143100) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a
trinucleotide repeat expansion within the huntingtin gene (613004),
resulting in generation of a polyglutamine tract in the protein product.
Peel et al. (2001) showed that PKR preferentially bound mutant
huntingtin RNA transcripts immobilized on streptavidin columns that had
been incubated with human brain extracts. Immunohistochemical studies
demonstrated that PKR was present in its activated form in both human
Huntington autopsy material and brain tissue derived from Huntington
yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mice. The increased
immunolocalization of the activated kinase was more pronounced in areas
most affected by the disease. The authors suggested a role for PKR
activation in the Huntington disease process.

Gale et al. (1998) showed that P58(IPK) (601184) is inhibited through a
direct interaction with P52(rIPK) (607374), which in turn results in
upregulation of PKR activity. Gale et al. (1998) concluded that their
data described a protein kinase-regulatory system that encompasses an
intersection of interferon-, stress-, and growth-regulatory pathways.

PKR, which is involved in TLR signaling and mediates apoptosis in
fibroblasts in response to viral infection and inflammatory cytokines,
also activates IKK (see 600664) and NFKB (see 164011), thereby
suppressing apoptosis. To determine the role of PKR in macrophage
apoptosis, Hsu et al. (2004) examined its regulation and found that both
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and poly(IC) activate PKR dependent on the
presence of TRIF (607601). Macrophages lacking PKR had normal activation
of p38 (MAPK14; 600289) and IKK as well as other NFKB target genes in
response to LPS, but exhibited defective STAT1 (600555) phosphorylation
and failed to undergo apoptosis, independent of the presence of IFNB
(147640). They observed that apoptosis induced by live pathogenic
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria required both TLR4 (603030) and
PKR, possibly representing a major mechanism for pathogenic bacteria
that use specific virulence factors to avoid detection and destruction
by the innate immune system. Hsu et al. (2004) proposed that TLR4
activates PKR and triggers apoptosis through TRIF and TRAM (608321)
adaptor proteins and that inhibition of PKR may augment
macrophage-mediated antibacterial responses.

Zhang et al. (2004) used immunoprecipitation and reconstituted kinase
assays to show that the FANCC (227645), FANCA (607139), and FANCG
(602956) proteins functionally interacted with and inhibited PKR in bone
marrow cells. PKR showed strongest binding to the FANCC protein. PKR
activity was increased in bone marrow cells of patients with Fanconi
anemia (FA; 227650) with mutations in the FANCC, FANCA, or FANCG genes.
All 3 of these cell lines showed significant increases in PKR bound to
the FANCC protein, which correlated with increased PKR activation. The
cells also showed hypersensitivity to growth repression mediated by
IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha (191160). Forced expression of a patient-derived
FANCC mutation increased PKR activation and cell death. Zhang et al.
(2004) concluded that FA mutations cause increased binding of PKR to
FANCC and increased PKR activation, leading to growth inhibition of
hematopoietic progenitors and bone marrow failure in Fanconi anemia.

Nallagatla et al. (2007) reported that RNAs with very limited secondary
structures activate PKR in a 5-prime-triphosphate-dependent fashion in
vitro and in vivo. Activation of PKR by 5-prime-triphosphate RNA is
independent of RIG1 (ROBO3; 608630) and is enhanced by treatment with
type I interferon (IFNA; 147660). Surveillance of molecular features at
the 5-prime end of transcripts by PKR presents a means of allowing
pathogenic RNA to be distinguished from self-RNA. Nallagatla et al.
(2007) concluded that this form of RNA-based discrimination may be a
critical step in mounting an early immune response.

To be effective, PKR must recognize a conserved substrate (eIF2A;
609234) while avoiding rapidly evolving substrate mimics such as the
poxvirus-encoded K3L. Using the PKR-K3L system and a combination of
phylogenetic and functional analyses, Elde et al. (2009) uncovered
evolutionary strategies by which host proteins can overcome viral
mimicry. Elde et al. (2009) found that PKR has evolved under intense
episodes of positive selection in primates. The ability of PKR to evade
viral mimics is partly due to positive selection at sites most
intimately involved in eIF2A recognition. They also found that adaptive
changes on multiple surfaces of PKR produce combinations of
substitutions that increase the odds of defeating mimicry. Elde et al.
(2009) concluded that, although it can seem that pathogens gain
insurmountable advantages by mimicking cellular components, host factors
such as PKR can compete in molecular 'arms races' with mimics because of
evolutionary flexibility at protein interaction interfaces challenged by
mimicry.

Using HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts,
Yoon et al. (2009) found PKR mRNA and protein were upregulated by p53
(TP53; 191170) and by genotoxic stress, which induces p53 expression.
Deletion analysis and DNase footprinting revealed 2 half-sites for p53
binding within the PKR promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays,
chromatin immunoprecipitation, and reporter gene assays revealed direct
p53 binding to these sites, with activation of the PKR promoter. Binding
and activation of PKR by p53 was independent of interferon binding. In
response to genotoxic stress, cytoplasmic PKR was largely phosphorylated
and was associated with the phosphorylation and activation of
EIF2-alpha. Knockdown of either p53 or PKR abrogated all cellular
effects of genotoxic stress. PKR also played a role in p53-mediated
inhibition of translation, G2 arrest, and apoptosis following DNA
damage. Furthermore, knockdown of PKR in HCT116 cells and derived tumors
provided resistance to anticancer agents. Yoon et al. (2009) concluded
that PKR has a role in p53-mediated cellular responses to genotoxic
stress.

By studying HMGB1 (163905) release mechanisms, Lu et al. (2012)
identified a role for PKR in inflammasome activation. Exposure of
macrophages to inflammasome agonists induced PKR autophosphorylation.
PKR inactivation by genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition
severely impaired inflammasome activation in response to double-stranded
RNA, ATP, monosodium urate, adjuvant aluminum, rotenone, live E. coli,
anthrax lethal toxin, DNA transfection, and S. typhimurium infection.
PKR deficiency significantly inhibited the secretion of IL1-beta
(147720), IL18 (600953), and HMGB1 in E. coli-induced peritonitis. PKR
physically interacts with several inflammasome components, including
NLRP3 (606416), NLRP1 (606636), NLRC4 (606831), and AIM2 (604578), and
broadly regulates inflammasome activation. PKR autophosphorylation in a
cell-free system with recombinant NLRP3, ASC (PYCARD; 606838), and
pro-caspase-1 (147678) reconstituted inflammasome activity. Lu et al.
(2012) concluded that their results showed a crucial role for PKR in
inflammasome activation, and indicated that it should be possible to
pharmacologically target this molecule to treat inflammation.

Lee et al. (2011) found that the long noncoding RNA VTRNA2-1 (614938),
which they called pre-MIR886, directly bound to PKR in human cell lines
and inhibited its autoactivation. VTRNA2-1 was downregulated and PKR was
activated in a significant number of diverse cancer cell lines.
Knockdown of VTRNA2-1 resulted in PKR activation and PKR-dependent
phosphorylation of EIF2-alpha. PKR activation also independently induced
the NF-kappa-B pathway.

Kunkeaw et al. (2012) confirmed that VTRNA2-1, which they called NC886,
was a direct inhibitor of PKR. Knockdown of NC886 in nontransformed
cholangiocyte cells consistently activated the canonical PKR-EIF2-alpha
cell death pathway. However, in cholangiocarcinoma cells that either
lacked endogenous NC886 expression or in which NC886 expression was
knocked down, PKR activation frequently induced the NF-kappa-B cell
survival pathway. Kunkeaw et al. (2012) concluded that the effects of
NC886 downregulation or PKR activation depend on cellular context.

Jeon et al. (2012) found that a central region of NC886 stably
interacted with the 2 N-terminal dsRNA-binding motifs of PKR, with much
weaker binding to each motif individually. PKR bound preferentially to
NC886 in its slow-migrating conformation when the PKR-binding sequence
was single-stranded and sensitive to RNase digestion, but not when it
assumed a 4-nucleotide duplex structure. NC886 reciprocally competed
with double-stranded poly(I:C) for PKR binding. Because NC886 does not
show an extensive duplex region, Jeon et al. (2012) predicted that NC886
and dsRNAs bind PKR via different mechanisms. They hypothesized that
NC886 provides a threshold for PKR activation so that it occurs during
genuine viral infection and not in response to basal levels of cellular
dsRNA.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ST3GAL3 gene encodes
beta-galactoside-alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase-III, a Golgi resident
membrane protein that forms the sialyl Lewis a (sLe-a) epitope on
glyocoproteins. These glycoproteins form the glycocalyx, composed of
sialic acids that act as key determinants of a variety of cellular
recognition and communication processes (summary by Hu et al., 2011).

CLONING

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with a probe based on the
sialyl motif (a highly conserved region in the catalytic domain of
sialyltransferases), Kitagawa and Paulson (1993) isolated a cDNA
encoding SIAT6, which they termed ST3N (EC 2.4.99.6). The deduced
375-amino acid protein is 97% identical to the rat protein. SDS-PAGE
analysis showed expression of an 80-kD protein having sialyltransferase
activity. Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript with abundant expression in skeletal muscle and high
expression in fetal tissue but low expression in placenta.

Using Northern blot analysis, Kitagawa and Paulson (1994) evaluated the
differential expression of 5 human sialyltransferase genes in adult and
fetal tissues. A 2.7-kb ST3N transcript was expressed highly in skeletal
muscle and moderately in most other tissues examined. A 3.8-kb
transcript was also expressed in testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Taniguchi et al. (2003) determined that the 5-prime UTR of the ST3GAL3
gene consists of 2 exons. The 5-prime flanking region of the promoter
lacks canonical TATA or CCAAT boxes, but it contains several putative
transcriptional factor binding sites.

Hu et al. (2011) stated that the ST3GAL3 gene contains 15 exons, 12 of
which are coding exons.

MAPPING

The International RH Mapping Consortium mapped the SIAT6 gene to
chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG22084).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Recessive Mental Retardation 12

In affected members of 2 unrelated consanguineous Iranian families with
autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090),
Hu et al. (2011) used linkage analysis, chromosome sorting, and
next-generation sequencing to identify 2 different homozygous mutations
in the ST3GAL3 gene (A13D, 606494.0001 and D370Y, 606494.0002,
respectively.) Neither mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl
motifs, but rather affected the N-terminal transmembrane domain and
catalytic domain, respectively. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutant proteins were mislocalized to the endoplasmic
reticulum and that one (D370Y) had loss of catalytic activity. The
findings demonstrated a link between the glycoprotein complex,
sialyltransferase activity, and higher cognitive functioning.

- Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 15

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous mutation in the ST3GAL3 gene (A320P;
606494.0003). The mutation was identified by linkage analysis combined
with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. The mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl motif S,
which is crucially involved in binding of both donor and acceptor
substrate. In vitro functional expression studies showed that secretion
of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of control levels and it had no
detectable enzymatic activity. The phenotype was severe: patients showed
delayed psychomotor development and had onset of refractory infantile
spasms between ages 3 and 7 months associated with hypsarrhythmia on
EEG. Other features included hypotonia, poor eye contact, and inability
to speak or walk, even later in childhood. All were profoundly mentally
retarded. Edvardson et al. (2013) noted that the phenotype was more
severe than that observed by Hu et al. (2011), who had identified
ST3GAL3 mutations outside of the highly conserved and functionally
important sialyl motifs.

ST3GAL3, ALA13ASP

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), previously reported by
Najmabadi et al. (2007), Hu et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 38C-A
transversion in exon 2 of the ST3GAL3 gene, resulting in an ala13-to-asp
(A13D) substitution in the transmembrane domain. The mutation was not
found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls or
in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that most of the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. Catalytic activity of the A13D mutant enzyme was similar to
wildtype.

ST3GAL3, ASP370TYR

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), Hu et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1108G-T transversion in exon 14 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an asp370-to-tyr (D370Y) substitution in the
catalytic domain at the C-terminal end of the protein. The mutation was
not found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls
or in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. The D370Y mutant protein also showed a complete lack of enzyme
activity. Studies of recombinant proteins in CHO cells indicated that
secretion of the D370Y mutant protein was dramatically reduced compared
to wildtype. Hu et al. (2011) concluded that the mutant protein was
cleared by the endoplasmic reticulum-mediated system, suggesting that
the C terminus is important for the proper folding of functional
ST3GAL3.

EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, EARLY INFANTILE, 15
ST3GAL3, ALA320PRO

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous 958G-C transversion in exon 12 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an ala320-to-pro (A320P) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in the sialyl motif S. The mutation was identified by
linkage analysis combined with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual
and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. It segregated with the disorder in
the family and was not found in 123 controls of the same ethnic origin
or in 5,379 control exomes. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that secretion of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of
control levels and that the protein had no detectable enzymatic
activity.

601651	TITLE *601651 NUCLEOSOME ASSEMBLY PROTEIN 1-LIKE 4; NAP1L4
;;NUCLEOSOME ASSEMBLY PROTEIN 2-LIKE; NAP2L;;
NAP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hu et al. (1996) used a positional cloning approach to isolate a gene
which is located 100 kb centromeric to the proximal Beckwith-Wiedemann
breakpoint cluster region (BWS; 130650) on chromosome 11p15. This gene
is homologous to the yeast nucleosome assembly protein NAP1 (164060).
The authors designated the new gene NAP2. They demonstrated that this
gene shows biallelic expression in all tissues tested and that it
therefore diverges in its expression from IGF2 (147470), H19 (103280),
and p57(KIP2) (600856), which also map to 11p15.5 in the vicinity of the
BWS gene. The NAP2 gene encodes a highly acidic protein of 375 amino
acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rodriguez et al. (1997) reported that the NAP1L4 gene consists of 14
exons and spans approximately 30.5 kb. A 1,200-bp 3-prime untranslated
region was present.

MAPPING

Hu et al. (1996) mapped the NAP1L4 gene to chromosome 11p15.5.

GENE FUNCTION

Histones are thought to play a key role in regulating gene expression at
the level of DNA packaging. The deduced amino acid sequence of NAP2
indicates that it is a protein with a potential nuclear localization
motif and 2 clusters of highly acidic residues. By functional analysis
of recombinant NAP2 protein purified from Escherichia coli, Rodriguez et
al. (1997) found that this protein can interact with both core and
linker histones (see 142709). They demonstrated that recombinant NAP2
can transfer histones onto naked DNA templates. Subcellular localization
studies of NAP2 indicated that it can shuttle between the cytoplasm and
nucleus, suggesting a role as a histone chaperone.

NAP1 and NAP2 facilitate nucleosome assembly by first depositing
preformed tetramers made up of 2 molecules each of histones H3 (see
602810) and H4 (see 602822) onto DNA prior to the addition of tetramers
made up of 2 molecules each of histones H2A (see 142720) and H2B (see
609904). Using recombinant human proteins in an in vitro nucleosome
formation assay, Tachiwana et al. (2008) confirmed that both NAP1 and
NAP2 promoted formation of nucleosomes containing the conventional
histones H2A, H2B, H3.1 (see 602810), and H4. NAP1 could also promote
nucleosome assembly with the H3 variants H3.2 (HIST2H3C; 142780), H3.3
(see 601128), and CENPA (117139), but not the testis-specific H3 variant
H3T (HIST3H3; 602820). In contrast, NAP2 promoted nucleosome assembly
with H3T, bound H3T/H4 tetramers efficiently, and was released from
H3T/H4 tetramers in the presence of DNA. Mutation analysis revealed that
a change of ala111, which is conserved among H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3, to
val in H3T was responsible for the differential binding of these H3
variants to NAP1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

NAP1L4 maps to a region implicated in Wilms tumor etiology (see 194071).
Rodriguez et al. (1997) analyzed the gene encoding NAP2 for mutations
and found no evidence of nonsense, frameshift, or deletion mutations.
Their findings, coupled with tumor suppression assays in Wilms tumor
cells, did not support a role for NAP2 in the etiology of that neoplasm.

602726	TITLE *602726 CHLORIDE CHANNEL 6; CLCN6
;;CLC6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the mammalian CLCN family of voltage-gated chloride channels
display differential tissue distribution and perform diverse functions.
Nomura et al. (1994) identified a partial human CLCN6 cDNA, which they
called KIAA0046. Northern blot analysis revealed that CLCN6 was
expressed widely. Using the partial cDNA sequence of Nomura et al.
(1994), Brandt and Jentsch (1995) cloned human cerebral cortex cDNAs
that covered the entire CLCN6 coding region. The predicted 869-amino
acid protein was called CLC6 by them. The amino acid sequence of CLCN6
is 45% identical to that of CLCN7 (602727) but only 23 to 29% identical
to the sequences of other known CLCNs. Therefore, Brandt and Jentsch
(1995) stated that CLCN6 and CLCN7 together define a new branch of the
chloride channel protein family. By Northern blot analysis, Brandt and
Jentsch (1995) found that CLCN6 was expressed as an approximately 6-kb
mRNA in all tissues examined. Eggermont et al. (1997) identified 4
different CLCN6 cDNAs that represent alternatively spliced transcripts.

MAPPING

Nomura et al. (1994) mapped the CLCN6 gene to chromosome 1 using a
somatic cell hybrid panel. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Brandt
and Jentsch (1995) refined the localization of the CLCN6 gene to 1p36.
They noted that 2 genes encoding kidney-specific chloride channels,
CLCNKA (602024) and CLCNKB (602023), also map to 1p36.

ANIMAL MODEL

Poet et al. (2006) found expression of the Clcn6 gene in neurons of
mouse brain, dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, and eye. Clcn6
colocalized with markers for late endosomes in neuronal cell bodies.
Clcn6-null mice showed reduced pain sensitivity and developed moderate
behavioral abnormalities. Neuronal tissues from these mice showed
enlarged proximal axons containing autofluorescent electron-dense
storage material, positive for lysosomal proteins. Poet et al. (2006)
suggested that CLCN6 may be a candidate gene for mild forms of human
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (see, e.g., CLN1; 256730).

602322	TITLE *602322 TELOMERASE RNA COMPONENT; TERC
;;TELOMERASE RNA CANDIDATE 3; TRC3;;
TR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Eukaryotic chromosomes are capped with repetitive telomere sequences
that protect the ends from damage and rearrangements. Telomere repeats
are synthesized by telomerase, an enzyme that has both a catalytic
(TERT; 187270) and an RNA component. The RNA component acts as a
template for the addition of telomeric repeat sequences (Feng et al.,
1995).

CLONING

Feng et al. (1995) cloned the 451-nucleotide gene for the telomerase RNA
component, which they designated TRC3. TRC3 copurified with telomerase.
TRC3 was highly expressed in the germline and in tumor cell lines, which
had high telomerase activity, and at lower levels in kidney, prostate,
and liver, which had no detectable telomerase activity.

MAPPING

Soder et al. (1997) mapped the mouse Terc gene to chromosome 3 and,
based on syntenic homology with human chromosomes, suggested that the
human TERC gene is located on 3q21-q28.

GENE FUNCTION

Feng et al. (1995) found that HeLa cells transfected with antisense TRC3
lost telomeric DNA and began to die after 23 to 26 divisions, showing
that telomerase is critical for the long-term proliferation of tumor
cells.

Inhibition or activation of the reverse transcriptase telomerase can
profoundly affect the proliferative capacity of normal cells and
cancers. Mitchell and Collins (2000) elucidated structural requirements
for function of the essential RNA component of human telomerase, TR. Two
motifs within the independently stable H/ACA domain of TR are required
for accumulation of the mature RNA in vivo. However, these motifs can be
substituted by a heterologous H/ACA family RNA. Two additional TR
elements are required both in vivo and in vitro for telomerase catalytic
activity. Surprisingly, these elements independently bind the telomerase
reverse transcriptase. The results established fundamental differences
between vertebrate and ciliate telomerase ribonucleoprotein
architectures.

Mitchell et al. (1999) demonstrated that dyskerin (300126) is associated
not only with H/ACA small nucleolar RNAs but also with human telomerase
RNA, which contains an H/ACA RNA motif. They found that primary
fibroblasts and lymphoblasts from dyskeratosis congenita (DKC;
305000)-affected males were not detectably deficient in conventional
H/ACA small nucleolar RNA accumulation or function. However, DKC cells
had a lower level of telomerase RNA, produced lower levels of telomerase
activity than matched normal cells, and had shorter telomeres. Mitchell
et al. (1999) concluded that the pathology of DKC is consistent with
compromised telomerase function leading to a defect in telomere
maintenance, which may limit the proliferative capacity of human somatic
cells in epithelia and blood.

De Lange and Jacks (1999) provided a comprehensive review of the status
of knowledge concerning the biologic importance of TERC.

Okuda et al. (2002) found no evidence for gender effect on telomere
length at birth and suggested that the longer length of telomeres in
women is due to a slower rate of telomere shortening.

Cohen et al. (2007) purified human telomerase 10(8)-fold, with the final
elution dependent on the enzyme's ability to catalyze nucleotide
addition onto a DNA oligonucleotide of telomeric sequence, thereby
providing specificity for catalytically active telomerase. Mass
spectrometric sequencing of the protein components and molecular size
determination indicated an enzyme composition of 2 molecules each of
telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT; 187270) and TERC.

Cristofari et al. (2007) stated that telomerase accumulates in Cajal
bodies (CBs) and that this localization relies on a CAB box motif (UGAG)
within the loop of a stem-loop structure of TERC. They found that
mutations of the CAB box of human TERC that impaired accumulation of
telomerase in CBs did not affect telomerase catalytic activity in vivo,
but they decreased association of telomerase with telomeres and impaired
telomere extension in human cells. Cristofari et al. (2007) concluded
that localization of telomerase within CBs is required to maintain
telomere length.

Box et al. (2008) showed that in Schizosaccharomyces pombe telomerase
RNA transcripts must be processed to generate functional telomerase.
Characterization of the maturation pathway uncovered an unexpected role
for the spliceosome, which normally catalyzes splicing of pre-messenger
RNA. The first spliceosomal cleavage reaction generates the mature
3-prime end of telomerase RNA (TER1, the functional RNA encoded by the
ter1+ gene), releasing the active form of the RNA without exon ligation.
Blocking the first step or permitting completion of splicing generates
inactive forms of TER1 and causes progressive telomere shortening. Box
et al. (2008) established that 3-prime end processing of TER1 is
critical for telomerase function and described a theretofore unknown
mechanism for RNA maturation that uses the ability of the spliceosome to
mediate site-specific cleavage.

Venteicher et al. (2009) found that TCAB1 (612661) associates with TERT,
established telomerase components dyskerin (300126) and TERC, and small
Cajal body RNAs (scaRNAs), which are involved in modifying splicing
RNAs. Depletion of TCAB1 by using RNA interference prevented TERC from
associating with Cajal bodies, disrupted telomerase-telomere
association, and abrogated telomere synthesis in telomerase. Thus,
Venteicher et al. (2009) concluded that TCAB1 controls telomerase
trafficking and is required for telomere synthesis in human cancer
cells.

A cardinal feature of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) is
acquisition of indefinite self-renewal capacity, which is accompanied by
induction of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene TERT. Agarwal et
al. (2010) investigated whether defects in telomerase function would
limit derivation maintenance of iPS cells from patients with
dyskeratosis congenita (DKC; see 127550). The authors showed that
reprogrammed dendritic congenita cells overcome a critical limitation in
TERC levels to restore telomere maintenance and self-renewal. Agarwal et
al. (2010) discovered that TERC upregulation is a feature of the
pluripotent state, that several telomerase components are targeted by
pluripotency-associated transcription factors, and that in autosomal
dominant DKC, transcriptional silencing accompanies a 3-prime deletion
at the TERC locus. Agarwal et al. (2010) concluded that their results
demonstrated that reprogramming restores telomere elongation in DKC
cells despite genetic lesions affecting telomerase, and showed that
strategies to increase TERC expression may be therapeutically beneficial
in DKC.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Dominant Dyskeratosis Congenita 1

Vulliamy et al. (2001) identified 3 different mutations in TERC in 3
families segregating autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita-1 (DKCA1;
127550). The first mutation (602322.0001) resulted in an 821-bp deletion
including the 74 3-prime basepairs of the coding region. The deleted
region is flanked by a 4-bp direct repeat, AGGA. Lymphocyte cell lines
derived from affected individuals in this family were examined by
Northern blot analysis. No difference was found between cell lines from
affected and unaffected individuals; however, RT-PCR using a
mutant-specific 3-prime primer abutting the point of the deletion showed
that the mutant transcript is barely detectable. Telomere length in
affected family members was significantly shorter than in normal
patients, even in young children with manifestation of disease. The
second mutation was a single-basepair substitution at nucleotide 408
(602322.0002). This mutation did not affect transcript levels, but is
predicted to destabilize the stem structure in the CR7 domain. A third
family had a 2-bp substitution at nucleotides 107 to 108 (602322.0003).
This mutation also did not affect transcript levels but appears to
destabilize a hairpin stem region in the pseudoknot region of the
proposed secondary structure of TERC. This region is essential for
telomerase activity and seems to be involved in interaction with
telomere reverse transcriptase (TERT; 187270).

Theimer et al. (2003) demonstrated that mutations in the TERC gene that
result in autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita cause changes in the
structural equilibrium of RNA polymerase. They reported structural and
thermodynamic studies of wildtype and mutant human telomerase subdomains
that provided 3D structural insight into the molecular basis of the
disease. The work revealed the presence of a phylogenetically conserved
hairpin in equilibrium with a pseudoknot in the telomerase pseudoknot
domain, which is stabilized by a unique uridine helix. Theimer et al.
(2003) proposed that interconversion between the hairpin and pseudoknot
conformations is functionally important, and that pseudoknot mutations
in dyskeratosis congenita affect this interconversion.

Vulliamy et al. (2004) demonstrated that anticipation occurs in
autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita and that the molecular basis
resides in progressive telomere shortening in successive generations. In
8 families, the disease became more severe in succeeding generations. Of
affected parents, 7 of 12 were asymptomatic, ranging in age from 36 to
61 years. In these cases, dyskeratosis congenita was diagnosed only by
the identification of a TERC mutation; subtle signs of the disease were
often detected subsequently. For the 5 remaining affected parents, the
median age at which disease features were first identified was 37 years.
Of the affected children, only 5 of 15 remained asymptomatic; they were
aged 3, 7, 11, 14, and 20 years and were diagnosed only through mutation
analysis. For the remaining 10 affected children, symptoms presented at
a median age of 14.5 years. Vulliamy et al. (2004) also observed a
number of individuals who had a bimodal distribution of telomere length.
A bimodal distribution had previously been observed in human fibroblast
cell lines where the short and long telomeres were linked to maternal
and paternal alleles. The difference in telomere length between the 2
alleles seemed to be maintained from the zygote throughout development
(Baird et al., 2003). Thus, another mechanism was added to the
phenomenon of disease anticipation. The only convincing mechanism
theretofore described involved expansion of triplet repeats as observed
in several neurodegenerative disorders. There are clear analogies here
with Terc knockout mice: parental mice have very long telomeres, and in
the first generation, Terc -/- mice are asymptomatic. Features of
telomere shortening, which overlap the clinical features seen in
dyskeratosis congenita, develop only in the fourth generation. By the
sixth generation, these mice become infertile.

Goldman et al. (2005) studied telomere dynamics over 3 generations in a
32-member extended family with autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita
due to TERC gene deletion. They found that in gene deletion carriers,
paternal and maternal telomeres were similarly short and similar in
length to those of the affected parent. In children of affected parents
who had normal TERC genes, parental telomeres were again similar in
length, but 2 generations appeared to be necessary to fully restore
normal telomere length. Goldman et al. (2005) concluded that these
results were consistent with a model in which telomerase preferentially
acts on the shortest telomeres. When TERC is limiting, this preference
leads to the accelerated shortening of longer telomeres.

Jongmans et al. (2012) observed somatic reversion of the mutant TERC
allele in blood cells of 2 affected members of a family with variable
manifestations of DKCA1 due to a heterozygous germline TERC mutation
(602322.0011). In both cases, the reversion occurred by acquired
uniparental disomy of chromosome 3q, including TERC, during mitotic
recombination. Four additional cases of a mosaic-reversion pattern in
blood cells were found among a cohort of 17 patients with germline TERC
mutations. None of the patients with somatic mosaic reversion had bone
marrow failure, and all had a small deletion in the TERC gene. The
findings indicated that revertant somatic mosaicism is a recurrent event
in DKCA1, which has important implications for diagnostic testing, often
performed on blood cells, and may help explain the variable phenotype of
the disorder.

- Telomere-Related Pulmonary Fibrosis and/or Bone Marrow Failure
2

Bone marrow failure in X-linked dyskeratosis congenita is caused by
mutations in the nucleolar protein dyskerin. This protein binds to a
particular class of small nucleolar RNAs called H/ACA as well as to
telomerase RNA. As discussed above, the very rare autosomal dominant
form of dyskeratosis congenita is caused by mutations in the RNA
component of telomerase, encoded by the TERC gene, and such patients
consequently have very short telomeres (Vulliamy et al., 2001). Patients
with idiopathic aplastic anemia and bone marrow failure (614743) also
have shorter telomeres than normal controls (Ball et al., 1998). This
prompted Vulliamy et al. (2002) to perform mutation screens of the TERC
gene in patients with aplastic anemia. They identified TERC mutations in
2 of 17 patients with idiopathic aplastic anemia, in 3 of 27 patients
with constitutional aplastic anemia, and in none of 214 normal controls.
Furthermore, patients with TERC mutations had significantly shorter
telomeres than age-matched controls. These data indicated that in a
subset of patients with aplastic anemia, the disorder may be associated
with a genetic lesion in the telomere maintenance pathway. Mutations
were heterozygous in each case. The 58G-A mutation (602322.0004) was
found in 3 of the patients, 2 of whom were categorized as having
idiopathic aplastic anemia and 1 as having constitutional aplastic
anemia (associated with short stature and phimosis). The age at first
clinical presentation in these 3 patients varied from 5 to 53 years.
This variability in the severity and age of onset in patients with the
same mutation highlighted the role of other genetic or environmental
factors in the clinical phenotype. Vulliamy et al. (2002) observed that
in X-linked dyskeratosis congenita, which is also characterized by
aplastic anemia, the recurrent mutation 1058C-T (300126.0006) is
associated with a wide variation in the age at onset of aplastic anemia
from 1 to 22 years. The constitutional nature of aplastic anemia can
sometimes be overlooked. In the patient of Vulliamy et al. (2002) with
the 72C-G mutation (602322.0005), the presence of pronounced
osteoporosis, discovered because of a bone fracture, led to the
categorization of constitutional rather than idiopathic disease.
Similarly, another patient with a 4-bp deletion in TERC (602322.0006)
had aplastic anemia alone; he would have been classified as idiopathic
if it were not for his sister who also had aplastic anemia.

In 2 families in which an adult was initially diagnosed with acquired
aplastic anemia, Fogarty et al. (2003) detected novel point mutations in
the TERC gene in affected members of both families: a heterozygous
116C-T transition (602322.0007) in 1 family, and a heterozygous 204C-G
transversion (602322.0008) in the other. Affected members of both
families had no physical signs of dyskeratosis congenita and nearly
normal blood counts, but all had severely shortened telomeres, reduced
hematopoietic function, and elevated serum erythropoietin and
thrombopoietin.

Mutations causing autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita and aplastic
anemia include base changes in a highly conserved putative telomerase
RNA pseudoknot. Comolli et al. (2002) described functional, structural,
and energetic properties of this structure. They demonstrated that the
pseudoknot domain exists in 2 alternative states of nearly equal
stability in solution: a structured P2b loop domain and the pseudoknot
formed by its pairing with P3. They showed that a 2-base mutation,
107GC-108AG (602322.0003), in 1 gene copy in a family with dyskeratosis
congenita abrogated telomerase activity. This mutation hyperstabilizes
the P2b intraloop structure, blocking pseudoknot formation. Conversely,
when the P3 pseudoknot pairing is hyperstabilized by deleting a
conserved bulge in P3, telomerase activity also decreases. Comolli et
al. (2002) proposed that the P2b/P3 pseudoknot domain acts as a
molecular switch, and interconversion between its 2 states is important
for telomerase function. Phylogenetic covariation in the P2b and P3
sequences of 35 species provided a compelling set of 'natural'
compensatory basepairing changes supporting the existence of the crucial
molecular switch.

Armanios et al. (2007) screened 73 probands with familial idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis (614743) for mutations in the TERT or TERC genes and
identified 5 mutations in TERT (see, e.g., 187270.0010) and 1 in TERC
(602322.0009) in 6 probands, respectively. Average telomere length was
significantly less in probands and asymptomatic mutation carriers than
in relatives who did not carry the mutation (p = 0.006), suggesting that
asymptomatic carriers may also be at risk for the disease.

Alder et al. (2008) screened 100 consecutive patients with sporadic
idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, the majority of whom had been
diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, for mutations in the TERT
and TERC genes and identified a mutation in 1 patient (602322.0010) that
was associated with short telomeres, led to a loss of activity, and was
not found in 194 healthy controls.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lee et al. (1998) investigated the role of the enzyme telomerase in
highly proliferative organs in successive generations of mice lacking
telomerase RNA. Late-generation animals exhibited defective
spermatogenesis, with increased programmed cell death (apoptosis) and
decreased proliferation in the testis. Proliferative capacity of
hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow and spleen was also compromised.
These progressively adverse effects coincided with substantial erosion
of telomeres and fusion and loss of chromosomes. These findings
indicated an essential role for telomerase, and hence telomeres, in the
maintenance of genomic integrity and in the long-term viability of
high-renewal organ systems.

To examine the role of telomerase in normal and neoplastic growth,
Blasco et al. (1997) deleted the telomerase RNA component from the mouse
germline. Terc -/- mice lacked detectable telomerase activity yet were
viable for the 6 generations analyzed. Telomerase-deficient cells could
be immortalized in culture and transformed by viral oncogenes, and
generated tumors in nude mice following transformation. Telomeres were
shown to shorten at a rate of 4.8 +/- 2.4 kb per Terc -/- generation.
Cells from the fourth Terc -/- generation onward possessed chromosome
ends lacking detectable telomere repeats, aneuploidy, and chromosomal
abnormalities, including end-to-end fusions. These results indicated
that telomerase is essential for telomere length maintenance but is not
required for establishment of cell lines, oncogenic transformation, or
tumor formation in mice.

To examine the role of telomerase in telomere maintenance and cellular
viability, Niida et al. (1998) established Terc-deficient embryonic stem
(ES) cells. It had been known that telomerase activity is absent in
cells from Terc knockout mice. Although telomere shortening had been
observed in the Terc-deficient cells from first to sixth generation
animals, whether telomerase-dependent telomere maintenance was essential
for cellular viability remained to be elucidated. Niida et al. (1998)
examined Terc-deficient ES cells under long-term culture conditions.
During their continual telomere shortening, the growth rate of
Terc-deficient ES cells was gradually reduced after more than 300
divisions. An impaired growth rate was maintained to approximately 450
divisions, and then cell growth virtually stopped.

Rudolph et al. (1999) studied a variety of physiologic processes in an
aging cohort of Terc -/- mice. Loss of telomere function did not elicit
a full spectrum of classic pathophysiologic symptoms of aging.
Age-dependent telomere shortening and accompanying genetic instability
were, however, associated with shortened life span, as well as a reduced
capacity to respond to stresses such as wound healing and hematopoietic
ablation. In addition, the authors found an increased incidence of
spontaneous malignancies. These findings demonstrated a critical role
for telomere length in the overall fitness, reserve, and well being of
the aging organism.

Artandi et al. (2000) monitored the cancer phenotype and cytogenetics of
large cohorts of telomerase-deficient p53 (191170) mutant mice. Mice
lacking the RNA component of telomerase (mTERC) exhibit progressive
telomere shortening and ultimately chromosomal instability (end-to-end
fusions) as a function of age and of successive generational matings. In
generation 1 and 2 mTERC -/- p53 -/- mice that lacked telomerase but
retained normal telomere function, median tumor incidence was similar to
that of mTERC +/+ p53 -/- and mTERC +/- p53 -/- controls. In contrast,
in later generations the progressive decline in telomere function
correlated with decreasing tumor latency. Similarly, in p53 +/- cohorts,
median tumor latency decreased progressively as telomeres became short
and dysfunctional. Telomere attrition in aging telomerase-deficient p53
mutant mice promotes the development of epithelial cancers by a process
of fusion-bridge breakage that leads to the formation of complex
nonreciprocal translocations - a classic cytogenetic feature of human
carcinomas. Artandi et al. (2000) concluded that their data suggest a
model in which telomere dysfunction brought about by continual
epithelial renewal during life generates the massive ploidy changes
associated with the development of epithelial cancers.

Wong et al. (2000) used the telomerase-deficient mouse, null for the
telomerase RNA gene, Terc, to assess the role of telomerase and telomere
function in the cellular and organismal response to ionizing radiation.
Although the loss of telomerase activity per se had no discernible
impact on the response to ionizing radiation, the emergence of telomere
dysfunction in late-generation Terc -/- mice imparted a radiosensitivity
syndrome associated with accelerated mortality. On the cellular level,
the gastrointestinal crypt stem cells and primary thymocytes showed
increased rates of apoptosis, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts showed
diminished dose-dependent clonogenic survival. The radiosensitivity of
telomere dysfunctional cells correlated with delayed DNA break repair
kinetics, persistent chromosomal breaks, and cytogenetic profiles
characterized by complex chromosomal aberrations and massive
fragmentation.

Inhibition of telomerase has been proposed to limit the growth of cancer
cells by triggering telomere shortening and cell death. Telomere
maintenance by telomerase is sufficient, in some cell types, to allow
immortal growth. Telomerase has been shown to cooperate with oncogenes
in transforming cultured primary human cells into neoplastic cells,
suggesting that telomerase activation contributes to malignant
transformation. Moreover, telomerase inhibition in human tumor cell
lines using dominant-negative versions of TERT leads to telomere
shortening and cell death. These findings have led to the proposition
that telomerase inhibition may result in cessation of tumor growth. The
absence of telomerase from most normal cells supports the potential
efficacy of anti-telomerase drugs for tumor therapy, as its inhibition
is unlikely to have toxic effects. Gonzalez-Suarez et al. (2000) showed
that late-generation Terc -/- mice, which have short telomeres and are
telomerase-deficient, are resistant to tumor development in multistage
skin carcinogenesis.

To investigate the processes that trigger cellular responses to telomere
dysfunction, Hemann et al. (2001) crossed Tr -/- generation-6 mice that
had short telomeres with mice heterozygous for telomerase (Tr +/-) that
had long telomeres. The phenotype of the telomerase null offspring was
similar to that of the late-generation parent, although only half of the
chromosomes were short. Spectral karyotyping analysis revealed that loss
of telomere function occurred preferentially on chromosomes with
critically short telomeres. These data indicated that it is not the
average but rather the shortest telomeres that constitute telomere
dysfunction and limit cellular survival in the absence of telomerase.

Wong et al. (2003) examined the impact of Atm deficiency as a function
of progressive telomere attrition at both the cellular and
whole-organism level in mice doubly null for Atm and Terc. These
compound mutants showed increased telomere erosion and genomic
instability, yet they experienced a substantial elimination of T-cell
lymphomas associated with Atm deficiency. A generalized proliferation
defect was evident in all cell types and tissues examined, and this
defect extended to tissue stem/progenitor cell compartments, thereby
providing a basis for progressive multiorgan system compromise,
accelerated aging, and premature death. Wong et al. (2003) showed that
Atm deficiency and telomere dysfunction act together to impair cellular
and whole-organism viability, thus supporting the view that aspects of
ataxia-telangiectasia (208900) pathophysiology are linked to the
functional state of telomeres and its adverse effects on stem/progenitor
cell reserves.

Goldman et al. (2005) noted that there are important differences in
telomere maintenance between mouse and human. Compared with humans,
laboratory mice have long telomeres. In addition, telomerase is
constitutively active in most murine tissues, whereas in humans
telomerase activity is greatly diminished in most somatic cells with the
exception of stem cells, their immediate progeny, and activated
lymphocytes and monocytes.

Hockemeyer et al. (2008) noted that mice lacking components of
telomerase fail to show phenotypes typical of DC. They developed a mouse
model in which key characteristics of DC were induced by enhanced
telomere degradation. Mice lacking the shelterin component Pot1b
(606478) (Pot1b -/-) and also deficient in Terc (Terc +/-) developed
progressive bone marrow failure, hyperpigmentation, and nail
abnormalities. Bone marrow failure was fatal between 4 and 5 months of
age in Pot1b -/- Terc +/- mice.

Begus-Nahrmann et al. (2009) analyzed the functional consequences of
conditional deletion of p53 (191170) in late-generation telomerase
knockout mice (Terc-null). Intestinal deletion of p53 shortened the life
span of telomere-dysfunctional mice without inducing tumor formation. In
contrast to deletion of p21 (116899), which elongates life span of
telomere-dysfunctional mice, the deletion of p53 impaired the depletion
of chromosomal-instable intestinal stem cells in aging
telomere-dysfunctional mice. These instable stem cells contributed to
epithelial regeneration leading to an accumulation of chromosomal
instability, increased apoptosis, altered epithelial cell
differentiation, and premature intestinal failure. Begus-Nahrmann et al.
(2009) concluded that their results provided the first experimental
evidence for an organ system in which p53-dependent mechanisms prevent
tissue destruction in response to telomere dysfunction by depleting
genetically instable stem cells.

Armanios et al. (2009) generated wildtype mice with short telomeres. In
these mice, Armanios et al. (2009) identified hematopoietic and immune
defects that resembled those present in patients with dyskeratosis
congenita (see 305000). Patients with dyskeratosis congenita have a
premature aging syndrome that can be caused by mutations in the RNA or
catalytic component of telomerase (TERC or TERT, 187270). When mice with
short telomeres were interbred, telomere length was only incrementally
restored, and even several generations later, wildtype mice with short
telomeres still displayed degenerative defects. Armanios et al. (2009)
concluded that their findings implicated telomere length as a unique
heritable trait and demonstrated that short telomeres are sufficient to
mediate the degenerative defects of aging.

Sahin et al. (2011) used transcriptomic network analyses in mice null
for either Tert or Terc, which exhibit telomere dysfunction, to identify
common mechanisms operative in hematopoietic stem cells, heart, and
liver. Their studies revealed profound repression of peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG; 601487), coactivator-1
alpha and beta (PCG1-alpha, 604517 and PGC1-beta, 608886), and the
downstream network. Consistent with PGCs as master regulators of
mitochondrial physiology and metabolism, telomere dysfunction was
associated with impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and function,
decreased gluconeogenesis, cardiomyopathy, and increased reactive oxygen
species. In the setting of telomere dysfunction, enforced Tert or
PGC1-alpha expression or germline deletion of p53 substantially restored
PGC network expression, mitochondrial respiration, cardiac function, and
gluconeogenesis. Sahin et al. (2011) demonstrated that telomere
dysfunction activates p53 which in turn binds and represses PGC1-alpha
and PGC1-beta promoters, thereby forging a direct link between telomere
and mitochondrial biology. Sahin et al. (2011) proposed that this
telomere-p53-PGC axis contributes to organ and metabolic failure and to
diminishing organismal fitness in the setting of telomere dysfunction.

In 2 families with autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita-1 (127550),
in which an adult was initially diagnosed with acquired aplastic anemia,
Fogarty et al. (2003) identified heterozygous point mutations in the
TERC gene in affected members of both families: a 116C-T transition in
the pseudoknot domain (CR2/CR3) in 1 family, and a 204C-G transversion
(602322.0008) in the other. Affected members of both families had no
physical signs of dyskeratosis congenita and nearly normal blood counts,
but all had severely shortened telomeres, reduced hematopoietic
function, and elevated serum erythropoietin and thrombopoietin. Neither
mutation was found in 194 phenotypically normal individuals.

Parry et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 204C-G transversion in the
TERC gene in 3 members of a family with telomere-related pulmonary
fibrosis and/or bone marrow failure-2 (614743). The telomere length in
mutation carriers was less than 1% of control, and the mutation was
demonstrated to result in compromised telomerase activity.

PULMONARY FIBROSIS AND BONE MARROW FAILURE, TELOMERE-RELATED, 2
TERC, 98G-A

In a female nonsmoker with telomere-related pulmonary fibrosis-2
(614743) who was diagnosed at 60 years of age and who died at age 66
years, Armanios et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a 98G-A
transition at a highly conserved site in the TERC gene, predicted to
impair base pairing in a helix of the essential pseudoknot domain.
Reconstitution of telomerase with the mutant 98A allele revealed severe
impairment of activity. The mutation was not found in 194 healthy
controls. Six family members had died of pulmonary fibrosis, including
the proband's mother; 3 died from aplastic anemia, and 1 individual died
from acute myeloid leukemia, probably in the setting of aplastic anemia.

In a patient with telomere-related pulmonary fibrosis-2 (614743), Alder

TERC gene, predicted to disrupt the conserved P5 helix. Younger
asymptomatic sibs of the proband also carried the mutation, which was
associated with short telomeres and led to a loss of activity as
quantitated by the direct telomerase activity assay. The mutation was
not found in 194 healthy controls.

.0011
DYSKERATOSIS CONGENITA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, 1
TERC, 4-BP DEL, NT54

In 7 members of a Dutch family with autosomal dominant dyskeratosis
congenita (127550), Jongmans et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous
4-bp deletion (54_57del) in the TERC gene. The proband was a 26-year-old
man with multiple features of the disorder, including dystrophic nails,
reticular pigmentation of the neck and chest, gray lock of hair,
aplastic anemia, pulmonary fibrosis, liver disease, and avascular
necrosis of the hip. The family history was positive for pulmonary
fibrosis, cirrhosis, and aplastic anemia. Although the mutation
segregated with the disease, the mutation load was decreased in blood of
the proband's father and the father's brother, both of whom had disease
limited to pulmonary fibrosis. The findings suggested somatic reversion
of the mutated allele to a normal state. SNP analysis of the blood from
the father and uncle showed that both had an acquired uniparental disomy
of chromosome 3q, including the TERC gene. Detailed blood analysis of 1
of the brothers showed 2 different mosaic reversion patterns in B cells,
granulocytes, and monocytes. T cells showed heterozygous levels of the
mutant allele, consistent with the longer lifespan of these cells. Thus,
mitotic recombination explained the reversion and phenotypic variability
in the brothers.

In 3 members of a family spanning 3 generations with telomere-related
pulmonary fibrosis and/or bone marrow failure-2 (614743), Parry et al.
(2011) identified a heterozygous 143G-A transition in the TERC gene. One
patient had pulmonary fibrosis, 1 had pulmonary fibrosis and liver
disease, and 1 had bone marrow failure.

.0013
BONE MARROW FAILURE, TELOMERE-RELATED, 2
TERC, 212C-G

In a father and son with telomere-related bone marrow failure-2
(614743), Kirwan et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 212C-G
transversion in the TERC gene. The son had severe aplastic anemia,
whereas the father presented with myelodysplastic syndrome at age 45
years. In vitro studies showed less than 1% telomerase activity, and
telomeres in the father were very short. The findings suggested that
constitutional TERC mutations are associated with the development of
myelodysplastic syndrome.

612824	TITLE *612824 SEC14-LIKE 3; SEC14L3
;;SEC14, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, 3;;
TOCOPHEROL-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; TAP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis of the region surrounding human TAP1 (SEC14L2;
607558), followed by RT-PCR analysis of human lung total RNA, Kempna et
al. (2003) cloned SEC14L3 and SEC14L4 (612825), which they called TAP2
and TAP3, respectively. SEC14L3 shares 86% similarity with SEC14L2. All
3 proteins share residues glu185 and lys216, which are predicted to play
a role in phospholipid binding and transfer activity in S. cerevisiae
Sec14. RT-PCR of human tissues and cell lines detected SEC14L3
expression in all tissues examined, with lower expression in skin,
blood, and liver. Immunocytochemical studies localized SEC14L3 to
intracellular membranes of the cytoplasm in HeLa cells, including
partial localization to the ER and Golgi, with more intense staining
surrounding but not within the nucleus.

Ye et al. (2004) independently cloned SEC14L3 as part of a large-scale
sequencing of human fetal brain cDNAs. The deduced 400-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 46.1 kD. SEC14L3 has a
conserved CRAL/TRIO domain and shares 76% homology to SEC14L2. In
contrast to Kempna et al. (2003), Ye et al. (2004) detected SEC14L3
expression in liver only by RT-PCR analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Kempna et al. (2003) showed that in HeLa cells deletion of the
C-terminal Golgi dynamics (GOLD) domain reduced SEC14L3 localization in
the region surrounding the nucleus with an increase in staining of
larger granules. They suggested that the SEC14L3 GOLD domain may play a
role in docking to other proteins or in intracellular transport of bound
ligands. Using several assays, Kempna et al. (2003) demonstrated that
SEC14L3 bound tocopherol, squalene, and phospholipids
(phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol).
Although SEC14L3 bound phospholipids, it failed to complement an S.
cerevisiae temperature-sensitive Sec14 allele in yeast. Using
immunoprecipitation assays, Kempna et al. (2003) showed that SEC14L3 may
interact with and regulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and
that SEC14L3 displayed low basal GTPase activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kempna et al. (2003) determined that the SEC14L3 gene contains 12 exons,
and Ye et al. (2004) stated that these 12 exons span 12.8 kb.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Kempna et al. (2003) mapped the SEC14L3 gene to
chromosome 22q12.1-qter, where it lies within 100 kb of the SEC14L2 and
SEC14L4 genes. Ye et al. (2004) independently mapped SEC14L3 to
chromosome 22q12 by database analysis.

607478	TITLE *607478 TRYPTOPHAN HYDROXYLASE 2; TPH2
;;TRYPTOPHAN HYDROXYLASE, NEURONAL; NTPH
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH; EC 1.14.16.4) is the rate-limiting enzyme
in the synthesis of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5HT). 5HT is
causally involved in numerous central nervous activities, and it has
several functions in peripheral tissues, including the maintenance of
vascular tone and gut motility.

CLONING

Using the TPH (191060) sequence as query, Walther et al. (2003)
identified a human genomic clone containing neuronal TPH, which they
designated TPH2. They subsequently cloned the full-length mouse Tph2
sequence, as well as the human and rat homologs. By RNase protection
assays specific for the Tph1 and Tph2 isoforms, they detected Tph1 mRNA
in mouse duodenum, but not in brain. Tph2, however, was detected
exclusively in brain. Mouse brainstem total RNA had about 150 times more
Tph2 than Tph1.

GENE FUNCTION

Walther et al. (2003) demonstrated that COS-7 cells expressing TPH2
acquired tryptophan-hydroxylating activity.

Zhang et al. (2004) created stable cell lines expressing variants of
Tph2 from mice of different genotypes and found that 5HT levels from
cells expressing arginine at position 447 were reduced by approximately
55% compared to cells expressing proline at position 447. BALB/cJ mice
showed approximately 50% and approximately 70% reductions in synthesis
of the 5HT precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP) in the frontal and
cortex striatum, respectively, as compared with 129X1/SvJ mice. Zhang et
al. (2004) also found other differences in Tph2 genotypes in mice of
different strains that correlated with synthesis of 5HT. They concluded
that their data provided evidence for the fundamental role of TPH2 in
5HT synthesis in the central nervous system.

Clark et al. (2005) used in situ hybridization histochemistry and
real-time RT-PCR to assess the effects of dexamethasone or estradiol on
TPH2 mRNA levels in the dorsal raphe nucleus of both ovariectomized
female and intact male mice. They found that TPH2 mRNA was regulated by
glucocorticoids but not by estradiol. Clark et al. (2005) suggested that
glucocorticoid-mediated reduction of TPH2 message may have relevance to
the etiology of major depression in cases where elevated glucocorticoids
are one hallmark of the disease.

Using fMRI, Brown et al. (2005) found that a -844G-T SNP in the upstream
regulatory region of the TPH2 gene biased the reactivity of the
amygdala, suggesting that the T allele may be associated with greater
promoter activity.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Walther et al. (2003) mapped the TPH2 gene
to chromosome 12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Association with Major Depressive Disorder

In individuals with unipolar major depression (see 608516), Zhang et al.
(2005) identified a 1463G-A transition (607478.0001) in the TPH2 gene.
This functional SNP in TPH2 replaces the highly conserved arg441 with
his (R441H), which resulted in approximately 80% loss of function in
serotonin production when TPH2 was expressed in PC12 cells. SNP analysis
in a cohort of 87 patients with unipolar major depression revealed that
9 patients carried the mutant allele, whereas among 219 controls, 3
subjects carried this mutation. In addition, this functional SNP was not
found in a cohort of 60 bipolar disorder patients. Identification of a
loss-of-function mutation in TPH2 suggested that a defect in brain
serotonin synthesis may represent an important risk factor for unipolar
major depression.

Garriock et al. (2005), however, found no evidence of the TPH2 R441H
mutation by sequence analysis of 182 patients with unipolar depression
(83 were treatment resistant), 186 nondepressed controls, and 8 bipolar
patients. The ethnicity and gender distribution was similar to that
studied by Zhang et al. (2005).

- Association with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder

Walitza et al. (2005) investigated the effect of polymorphic variants in
the TPH2 gene in 225 children with ADHD (143465) in 103 families. Three
SNPs in and downstream of the transcriptional control region were
assessed using the pedigree disequilibrium test. Preferential
transmissions were detected for 2 of the SNPs (dbSNP rs4570625, p =
0.049; dbSNP rs11178997, p = 0.034). Haplotype analysis revealed a trend
of association between these 2 SNPs and ADHD (p = 0.064).

McKinney et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous mutation in the TPH2
gene (R303W; 607478.0002) in a mother and daughter with ADHD (ADHD7;
613003). In vitro functional expression studies showed loss of enzyme
activity.

- Association with Bipolar Disorder

In 2 cohorts of patients with bipolar affective disorder (BPAD; 125480)
from Germany and Russia totaling 883 patients and 1,300 controls, Cichon
et al. (2008) observed an association between disease and the minor
alleles of 3 SNPs in haplotype 1 of the TPH2 gene (dbSNP rs11178997,
dbSNP rs11178998, and dbSNP rs7954758; odds ratio of 1.6, p value of
0.00073). Haplotype 1 covers part of the 5-prime regulatory region and
exons 1 and 2 of the TPH2 gene. Cichon et al. (2008) also observed an
association between bipolar disorder and a nonsynonymous SNP in the TPH2
gene (P206S; 607478.0003).

ANIMAL MODEL

Beaulieu et al. (2008) generated knockin mice with a Tph2 variant
similar to the human R441H variant. Expression of this mutant Tph2
resulted in markedly decreased brain 5HT production and behavioral
abnormalities related to depression and anxiety. The reduction of 5HT
was associated with activation of Gsk3b (605004) in the frontal cortex.
Inactivation of Gsk3b in Tph2 knockin mice alleviated the aberrant
behaviors induced by 5HT deficiency. Beaulieu et al. (2008) concluded
that Tph2 plays a role in serotonin homeostasis and identified
GSK3B-mediated signaling as an important pathway involved in
serotonin-related behaviors.

Alenina et al. (2009) found that Tph2-null mice were viable, but showed
growth retardation and 50% lethality within the first 4 weeks of life,
although some survived into adulthood. Tph2-null mice had significantly
decreased serotonin levels in all brain regions analyzed. They
demonstrated more extended daytime sleep, suppressed respiration,
altered body temperature control, and decreased heart rate and blood
pressure during the night. Tph2-null females showed impaired maternal
care and increased aggression. Alenina et al. (2009) concluded that most
serotonin in the central nervous system is generated by Tph2, and that
this serotonin is involved in behavior and autonomic regulation.

Liu et al. (2011) reported that the neurotransmitter 5HT is required for
male sexual preference. Wildtype male mice preferred females over males,
but males lacking central serotonergic neurons lost sexual preference
although they were not generally defective in olfaction or in pheromone
sensing. A role for 5HT was demonstrated by the phenotype of mice
lacking Tph2, which is required for the first step of 5HT synthesis in
the brain. Thirty-five minutes after the injection of the intermediate
5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP), which circumvented Tph2 to restore 5HT to
the wildtype level, adult Tph2 knockout mice also preferred females over
males. Liu et al. (2011) concluded that 5HT and serotonergic neurons in
the adult brain regulate mammalian sexual preference.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
UNIPOLAR DEPRESSION, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
TPH2, ARG441HIS

Zhang et al. (2005) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1463 of
the TPH2 gene that replaces the highly conserved arg at position 441
with his (R441H). This mutation resulted in an approximately 80% loss of
function in serotonin production when TPH2 was expressed in PC12 cells.
SNP analysis in a cohort of 87 patients with unipolar major depression
(see 608516) revealed that 9 patients carried the mutant allele, while
among 219 controls, 3 subjects carried this mutation. Interestingly,
depressed patients carrying this mutation were poorly responsive or
unresponsive to SSRIs. The 3 control subjects carrying this mutation
were not diagnosed as having unipolar major depression, but they
displayed clinical symptoms of comorbid conditions. One of the 3 control
subjects, carrying homozygous mutant alleles, had generalized anxiety
symptoms, while the other 2, carrying heterozygous alleles, had mild
depression and a family history of mental illness or drug and alcohol
abuse, suggesting a potentially higher susceptibility for certain
neuropsychiatric disorders in the presence of the mutant allele. This
mutation was not identified in 60 patients with bipolar disorder.
Garriock et al. (2005), however, found no evidence of the TPH2 R441H
mutation by sequence analysis of 182 patients with unipolar depression
(83 were treatment resistant), 186 nondepressed controls, and 8 bipolar
patients. The ethnicity and gender distribution was similar to that
studied by Zhang et al. (2005).

By in vitro functional expression studies, McKinney et al. (2009)
demonstrated that the R441H mutant protein had moderately decreased
stability and solubility, as well as decreased activity (9% of
wildtype). The substitution is within the catalytic domain of the
protein.

.0002
ATTENTION DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 7
TPH2, ARG303TRP

In a Norwegian woman with ADHD (ADHD7; 613003), McKinney et al. (2008)
identified a heterozygous 907C-T transition in exon 7 of the TPH2 gene,
resulting in an arg303-to-trp (R303W) substitution in a highly conserved
residue located at the entry of the active site. The patient also had a
history of major depression. Her daughter, who also carried the
mutation, had ADHD. Both reported an excellent response to stimulant
medication. The mutation was not found in 323 additional ADHD patients
or 87 controls. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutant protein had less than 5% residual enzyme activity and decreased
solubility, compatible with a folding defect or increased hydrophobicity
of the mutant protein. McKinney et al. (2008) concluded that a
loss-of-function TPH2 mutation leads to reduced serotonin synthesis,
which may result in increased susceptibility to ADHD and possibly other
psychiatric disorders.

.0003
BIPOLAR AFFECTIVE DISORDER, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
TPH2, PRO206SER

Cichon et al. (2008) found an association between a 757C-T transition in
exon 6 of the TPH2 gene, resulting in a pro206-to-ser (P206S)
substitution (dbSNP rs17110563) and bipolar affective disorder (125480)
in 2 cohorts from Germany and Russia, totaling 883 patients and 1,300
controls. In the combined sample, the ser206 allele yielded an odds
ratio of 4.8 for development of the disorder (p value of 0.0024). In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the P206S protein had
similar catalytic activity as wildtype, but decreased solubility and
thermal stability. Further studies suggested a mild dominant-negative
effect.

By in vitro functional expression studies, McKinney et al. (2009)
demonstrated that the P206S protein had significantly decreased
stability and solubility, as well as decreased activity compared to
wildtype. P206S is located on surface-exposed side chains and may result
in reduced stability.

609752	TITLE *609752 NUCLEAR RECEPTOR COACTIVATOR 7; NCOA7
;;ERAP140
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By Far Western screening of a lymphoma cell cDNA library for estrogen
receptor-alpha (ESR1; 133430)-associated factors, Shao et al. (2002)
identified a novel cDNA, nuclear receptor coactivator-7. NCOA7 encodes a
942-amino acid protein, which the authors called ERAP140 (estrogen
receptor-associated protein of 140 kD). Northern blot analysis revealed
an approximately 5.5-kb transcript in all tumor lines examined,
including ESR-positive and ESR-negative breast cancer cell lines and
HeLa cells. Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues revealed
highest expression in brain, with lower expression in mammary gland,
ovary, uterus, prostate, stomach, bladder, spinal cord, and pancreas. In
situ hybridization in mouse tissues demonstrated exclusive expression in
neurons in brain and significant expression in the cortex but not in the
medulla in kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Using GST pull-down assays, Shao et al. (2002) found that NCOA7
demonstrated a low level of ligand-dependent constitutive binding to
ESR1, ESR2 (see 601663), THRB (190160), PPARG (601487), and RARA
(180240). Binding was further induced by the presence of ligands. NCOA7
did not bind to RXRA (180245) in the presence or absence of ligand.
NCOA7 can enhance the transcriptional activity of the nuclear receptors
with which it interacts.

Shao et al. (2002) found that NCOA7 differs from other nuclear receptor
coactivators in that it does not contain an LXXLL receptor-coactivator
interaction motif. Instead it contains a central domain between amino
acids 489 and 559 that mediates ESR1 binding. A leucine at position 523
and/or an isoleucine at position 524 appeared to be essential for the
interaction, and the binding surface appeared to be similar to that of
other coactivators.

GENE STRUCTURE

Shao et al. (2002) demonstrated that the NCOA7 gene contains 15 exons
and spans about 150 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Shao et al. (2002) mapped the NCOA7 gene to
chromosome 6q22.33.

614121	TITLE *614121 POLY(A) POLYMERASE-ASSOCIATED DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 4; PAPD4
;;GLD2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PAPD4 is a poly(A) polymerase (PAP; EC 2.7.7.19). Gld2, the C. elegans
ortholog of PAPD4, functions as a cytoplasmic PAP that regulates stem
cell fate and is required for stem cells to complete meiosis (Kwak et
al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching a human database for sequences similar to C. elegans Gld2,
followed by PCR of a human breast cancer cell line, Kwak et al. (2004)
cloned PAPD4, which they called GLD2. The deduced 484-amino acid protein
contains a catalytic domain within a central domain that shares higher
similarity with C. elegans cytosolic Gld2 than with canonic nuclear PAP
(PAPOLA; 605553). Kwak et al. (2004) also cloned mouse Gld2, which
encodes a deduced 484-amino acid protein that shares 93% identity with
human GLD2.

GENE FUNCTION

Kwak et al. (2004) stated that C. elegans Gld2 has little PAP activity
until it is directed to RNA via interaction with Gld3, an RNA-binding
protein. They showed that Gld2 tethered to RNA via Ms2, a nonnative
RNA-binding protein, efficiently catalyzed polyadenylation of reporter
mRNA. Similarly, mouse and human GLD2 catalyzed polyadenylation of
reporter mRNA to which they were tethered.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the PAPD4 gene to chromosome 5q14.1 based on an
alignment of the PAPD4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK095818) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the cadherin superfamily are major cell-cell adhesion
molecules. See 601120. The cell-cell adhesion of fibroblasts is thought
to be necessary for wound healing. To elucidate the molecular basis of
fibroblast cell-cell adhesion, Matsuyoshi and Imamura (1997)
investigated cadherin expression in human fibroblasts by RT-PCR using
degenerate primers based on well-conserved amino acid sequences of
cadherins. They isolated partial cDNAs encoding PCDH2 (603627), FAT
(600976), and 3 novel cadherins, which they named FIB1, FIB2 (603058),
and FIB3 (603059). RT-PCR analysis revealed that FIB1 is expressed in
fibroblasts but not in melanocytes or keratinocytes.

EVOLUTION

Green et al. (2010) published a draft sequence of the Neandertal genome.
Comparisons of the Neandertal genome to the genomes of 5 present-day
humans from different parts of the world identified a number of genomic
regions that may have been affected by positive selection in ancestral
modern humans, including genes involved in metabolism and in cognitive
and skeletal development. Green et al. (2010) found 78 nucleotide
substitutions that change the protein coding capacity of genes where
modern humans are fixed for a derived state and where Neandertals carry
the ancestral (chimpanzee-like) state. Thus, relatively few amino acid
changes have become fixed in the last few hundred thousand years of
human evolution, an observation consistent with a complementary study
(Burbano et al., 2010). There are only 5 genes with more than 1 fixed
substitution changing the primary structure of the encoding proteins.
One of these is PCD16, which encodes fibroblast cadherin-1, a
calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecule that may be involved in
wound healing. Green et al. (2010) also showed that Neandertals shared
more genetic variants with present-day humans in Eurasia than with
present-day humans in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that gene flow from
Neandertals into the ancestors of non-Africans occurred before the
divergence of Eurasian groups from each other.

606941	TITLE *606941 ALG9, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; ALG9
;;DISRUPTED IN BIPOLAR DISORDER 1; DIBD1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Smith et al. (1989) and Baysal et al. (1998) described a small family in
which 5 individuals in 3 generations were affected with bipolar
affective disorder (BPAD; see 125480) and 1 individual was affected with
recurrent unipolar depression. All 6 affected individuals were carriers
of a balanced chromosomal translocation, t(9;11)(p24;q23). By gene
analysis of the breakpoint junctions, Baysal et al. (2002) identified
disruption of a novel gene at 11q23, which they symbolized DIBD1. The
predicted 611-amino acid DIBD1 protein is a mannosyltransferase similar
to the S. cerevisiae Alg9 protein of the N-glycosylation pathway and has
8 transmembrane helices. Northern blot analysis detected expression of
DIBD1 in all tissues tested, with highest expression in heart, liver,
and pancreas. The most abundant transcript was 2.5 kb, although 0.25-,
5.5-, and 7.0-kb transcripts were also observed. In subregions of the
brain, the 2.5- and 7.0-kb transcripts were expressed ubiquitously.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Baysal et al. (2002) determined that the
ALG9 gene has 15 exons and spans 85 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Baysal et al. (2002) mapped the ALG9 gene
to chromosome 11q23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using an intragenic polymorphism and other markers, Baysal et al. (2002)
performed linkage and linkage disequilibrium analyses in 2 National
Institute of Mental Health bipolar pedigree series and found no support
for a role of DIBD1 in disease susceptibility.

Frank et al. (2004) reported a female patient with a novel type of CDG I
(CDG Il; 608776). The authors detected a homozygous point mutation,
1567G-A (amino acid substitution E523K; 606941.0001) in the ALG9 gene. A
yeast complementation assay lacking the ALG9 gene confirmed the
deleterious effect of the E523K mutation as well as the functional
homology between the human and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ALG9.

Weinstein et al. (2005) reported a female infant with CDG Il in whom
they identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the ALG9 gene
(Y286C; 606941.0002).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CONGENITAL DISORDER OF GLYCOSYLATION, TYPE Il
ALG9, GLU523LYS

Frank et al. (2004) described a novel type of congenital disorder of
glycosylation (CDG1L; 608776) in a female infant born at term as a twin
with a birth weight of 2.75 kg, length of 44 cm, and head circumference
of 31.5 cm. As she grew older, her clinical features included severe
microcephaly, central hypotonia, seizures, hepatomegaly, developmental
delay, and bronchial asthma. This pattern of clinical presentation was
compatible with CDG, a diagnosis confirmed by isoelectric focusing
analysis of serum transferrin. The patient's sample showed an increase
of disialo- and asialo-transferrin, indicative of CDG I. Normal values
of phosphomannomutase activity excluded the most frequent form of CDG,
type Ia (212065). The accumulation of 2 lipid-linked oligosaccharides
(LLOs) suggested a possible defect at the level of
alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase, which, in yeast, catalyzes the addition
of the seventh and ninth mannose residues on growing LLOs. In the
patient, ALG9 cDNA was found to carry the point mutation 1567G-A, which
caused the amino acid change glu523-to-lys (E523K) in the ALG9 protein.
The mutation was also detected at the genomic level by sequencing exon
14 of the patient's ALG9 gene.

.0002
CONGENITAL DISORDER OF GLYCOSYLATION, TYPE Il
ALG9, TYR286CYS

In a female infant with CDG Il (608776), Weinstein et al. (2005)
identified homozygosity for an 860A-G transition in the ALG9 gene,
resulting in a tyr286-to-cys (Y286C) substitution. The parents were
heterozygous for the mutation.

605586	TITLE *605586 IMPORTIN 7; IPO7
;;RAN-BINDING PROTEIN 7; RANBP7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The transport of protein and large RNAs through the nuclear pore
complexes (NPC) is an energy-dependent and regulated process. The import
of proteins with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) is accomplished by
recognition of one or more clusters of basic amino acids by the
importin-alpha/beta complex; see 600685 and 602738. The small GTPase RAN
(601179) plays a key role in NLS-dependent protein import. Gorlich et
al. (1997) purified a human Ran-binding protein, which they designated
RANBP7, from HeLa cell extract using a column with an immobilized
importin-beta-binding (IBB) domain. Both Xenopus and human RANBP7 bind
to the IBB domain of importin-alpha via importin-beta. Human RANBP7 is
approximately 95% identical to the Xenopus protein RanBP7. RANBP7
belongs to a Ran-binding protein superfamily whose members share with
importin-beta an N-terminal sequence motif that appears to account for
RanGTP binding.

GENE FUNCTION

Based on oocyte injection experiments, Gorlich et al. (1997) showed that
Xenopus RanBP7 is predominantly a cytoplasmic protein that shuttles
between nucleus and cytoplasm. Fluorescence labeling experiments
indicated that RanBP7 binds to NPC at the same site as importin-beta.
Although interaction between RanBP7 and importin-beta is unrelated to
NLS-mediated protein import, RanBP7 binds to RanGTP. RanGTP/RanBP7
binding prevents formation of the RanBP7/importin-beta complex and
dissolves preformed RanBP7/importin-beta complex. The authors
demonstrated that RanBP7 can form a trimeric complex with RanGTP and
RanBP1 (601180), and that RanBP7 inhibits GAP stimulation of the Ran
GTPase. Furthermore, RanBP7 requires nuclear RanGTP for export and is
exported as a complex with RanGTP.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RANBP7
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP WI-31060).

607472	TITLE *607472 MITOCHONDRIAL ESCAPE 1-LIKE 1; YME1L1
;;YME1L;;
YME1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, 1;;
PRESENILIN-ASSOCIATED METALLOPROTEASE; PAMP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

YME1L1 shares significant homology with 3 members of the AAA superfamily
of metalloproteases from S. cerevisiae, Afg3 (see 603020), Rca1, and
Yme1. In yeast, these proteins are localized to the mitochondrial inner
membrane, where they perform roles in the assembly and turnover of
respiratory chain complexes.

CLONING

Using database analysis, conventional screening, and 5-prime RACE,
Coppola et al. (2000) cloned YME1L1 from a fetal brain cDNA library. The
deduced 716-amino acid protein contains an AAA consensus sequence, an
ATP/GTP-binding motif, and a zinc-dependent binding domain. YME1L1
shares 50% sequence identity with yeast Yme1, 40% identity with yeast
Rca1, and 39% identity with yeast Afg3, with highest homology in the
central regions of the proteins. Northern blot analysis revealed
transcripts of about 2.6 and 4.4 kb in all tissues examined, with
greatest abundance in adult heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. The
shorter transcript likely results from the use of an alternate
polyadenylation site. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos revealed
ubiquitous expression. YME1L1 overexpressed in COS-7 cells showed a
granular cytoplasmic localization, with higher density of puncta around
the nucleus, and colocalization with a mitochondrial marker.

Using the C termini of presenilin-1 (PSEN1; 104311) and presenilin-2
(PSEN2; 600759) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a brain cDNA
library, followed by screening a liver cDNA library, Pellegrini et al.
(2001) cloned YME1L1, which they designated PAMP. Northern blot analysis
detected 2 PAMP transcripts with different 3-prime untranslated regions.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast strain in which the Yme1 gene was disrupted, Shah et al.
(2000) found that transfection and expression of YME1L1 restored growth
under conditions that were lethal to the Yme1-disrupted cells. Shah et
al. (2000) concluded that YME1L1 plays a phylogenetically conserved role
in mitochondrial protein metabolism.

GENE STRUCTURE

Coppola et al. (2000) determined that the YME1L1 gene contains 19 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Coppola et al. (2000) mapped the YME1L1
gene to chromosome 10q14. However, Gross (2008) mapped the YME1L1 gene
to chromosome 10p12.1 based on an alignment of the YME1L1 sequence
(GenBank GENBANK AJ132637) with the genomic sequence (build 36.3).

610745	TITLE *610745 STIMULATED BY RETINOIC ACID 6; STRA6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Bouillet et al. (1997) cloned mouse Stra6. The deduced 670-amino acid
protein has 9 potential transmembrane domains. RT-PCR detected highest
Stra6 expression in brain, kidney, spleen, testis, and female genital
tract, and much lower expression in heart, lung, and liver.
Immunohistochemical analysis and in situ hybridization of embryonic and
adult mice showed that Stra6 was broadly expressed in a cell
type-specific manner. In adult mice, Stra6 was strongly expressed at
blood-organ barriers. In vitro translation resulted in a protein with an
apparent molecular mass of 74 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using differential subtractive hybridization, Bouillet et al. (1997)
found that expression of Stra6 was upregulated in mouse embryonal
carcinoma cells following treatment with retinoic acid. RT-PCR showed
that Stra6 transcripts accumulated in a time- and retinoic acid
concentration-dependent manner. In mouse Sertoli cells, Stra6 was
expressed in a spermatogenic cell cycle-dependent manner. However, in
testes of retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA; 180240)-null mice, Stra6
was abnormally expressed in all tubules.

Kawaguchi et al. (2007) identified STRA6 as the membrane receptor for
retinol binding protein (RBP1; 180260), which mediates cellular uptake
of vitamin A.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bouillet et al. (1997) determined that the mouse Stra6 gene contains 19
exons.

Pasutto et al. (2007) determined that the human STRA6 gene contains 20
exons.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the STRA6 gene to chromosome 15q24.1 based on an
alignment of the STRA6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF370419) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pasutto et al. (2007) observed 2 unrelated consanguineous families with
malformation syndromes sharing clinical anophthalmia and distinct
eyebrows as common signs, but differing for alveolar capillary dysplasia
or complex congenital heart defect in one and diaphragmatic hernia in
the other family (MCOPS9; 601186). Homozygosity mapping revealed linkage
to a common locus on chromosome 15, and pathogenic homozygous mutations
were identified in STRA6, a member of a large group of 'stimulated by
retinoic acid' genes encoding novel transmembrane proteins,
transcription factors, and secreted signaling molecules or proteins.
Subsequently, Pasutto et al. (2007) demonstrated homozygous STRA6
mutations in 3 of 13 patients chosen on the basis of significant
phenotypic overlap to the original cases. A homozygous deletion
generating a premature stop codon (G50AfsX22; 610745.0002) led to
absence of the immunoreactive protein in the patient's fibroblast
culture. Structural analysis of 3 missense mutations (P90L, 610745.0005;
P293L, 610745.0001; and T321P, 610745.0005) suggested significant
effects on the geometry of the loop connecting the transmembrane helices
of STRA6. Two further variations in the C terminus (T644M, 610745.0004
and R655C, 610745.0003) altered specific functional sites, an
SH2-binding motif and a phosphorylation site, respectively. STRA6
mutations thus define a pleiotropic malformation syndrome representing
the first human phenotype associated with mutations in a gene from the
STRA group.

Retinoic acid is a potent teratogen in all vertebrates when tight
homeostatic controls on its endogenous dose, location, or timing are
perturbed during early embryogenesis. STRA6 encodes an integral cell
membrane protein that favors retinoic acid uptake from soluble
retinol-binding protein; its transcription is directly regulated by
levels of retinoic acid. Golzio et al. (2007) performed molecular
analysis of the STRA6 gene in 2 families with Matthew-Wood syndrome
(MCOPS9; 601186). One of the fetuses had a homozygous insertion/deletion
in exon 2 and the other had a homozygous insertion in exon 7. Both
predicted a premature stop codon in STRA6 transcripts.

Using DNA extracted from a paraffin block of autopsy tissue from a male
infant with clinical anophthalmia and diaphragmatic eventration, who was
originally reported by Steiner et al. (2002), West et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for a 2-bp insertion and a nonsense
mutation, both in exon 2 of the STRA6 gene (610745.0009 and
610745.0010).

Segel et al. (2009) reported a 2.5-year-old girl with clinical
anophthalmia, bushy eyebrows, patent ductus arteriosus, and normal
cognitive development who was compound heterozygous for 2 missense
mutations in the STRA6 gene (610745.0012 and 610745.0013). The authors
suggested that clinical anophthalmia is the major phenotypic effect of
STRA6 mutations and that it may be compatible with normal psychomotor
development.

In a large consanguineous Irish Traveller family with isolated
microphthalmia and coloboma (MCOPCB8; see 601186), Casey et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the STRA6 gene
(G304K; 610745.0011). Homozygosity for the same G304K mutation was
identified in 2 more Irish Traveller probands, 1 with microphthalmia and
dysplastic right kidney, and 1 who fulfilled the criteria for
Matthew-Wood syndrome (MCOPS9). Functional analysis showed that G304K
mutant STRA6 is mislocalized and has severely reduced vitamin A uptake
activity.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a retinoic acid (RA) synthesis inhibitor in zebrafish embryos,
Casey et al. (2011) modeled different levels of RA and observed
dose-dependent microphthalmia. The inhibitor produced developmental eye
defects ranging from mild to severe microphthalmia as well as retinal
pigment epithelium coloboma, also in a range of severity. Other
developmental defects were visible, including defects in heart
morphogenesis, consistent with the role of RA in multiple developmental
processes.

STRA6, PRO293LEU

In 2 affected female infants of a consanguineous Turkish family who had
bilateral clinical anophthalmia and variable pulmonary and cardiac
defects (MCOPS9; 601186), Pasutto et al. (2007) identified homozygosity
for an 878C-T transition in exon 12 of the STRA6 gene that resulted in a
pro293-to-leu (P293L) substitution. One infant died at 6 months of age
due to respiratory insufficiency and the other at 2 days of age due to a
complex cyanotic heart defect.

STRA6, 1-BP DEL, 145C

In the 14-year-old male proband of a consanguineous Turkish family who
had bilateral clinical anophthalmia, diaphragmatic hernia, atrial and
ventricular septal defects, severe short stature, and profound mental
retardation (MCOPS9; 601186), Pasutto et al. (2007) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion in exon 4 of the STRA6 gene
(145-147delC) that resulted in frameshift and premature termination of
the protein product (G50AfsX22).

.0003
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 9
STRA6, ARG655CYS

In a male infant with bilateral clinical anophthalmia, left
diaphragmatic eventration, and right inguinal hernia (MCOPS9; 601186)
who died at 3 months of age, Pasutto et al. (2007) identified a
homozygous missense mutation, arg655 to cys (R655C), caused by a 1963C-T
transition in exon 20 of the STRA6 gene. The parents were distantly
related. An older brother, who had bilateral clinical anophthalmia,
truncus arteriosus communis with right aortic arch, pulmonary artery
atresia, and patent ductus arteriosus, died at age 22 months due to
thrombosis of the bronchial arterial branches. This child could feed
himself and speak in short sentences and thus showed no evidence of
mental retardation.

MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 9
STRA6, THR644MET

In a female infant with bilateral clinical anophthalmia, right
diaphragmatic hernia, pulmonary hypoplasia, and bilateral hydronephrosis
(MCOPS9; 601186), Pasutto et al. (2007) identified homozygosity for a
1931C-T transition in exon 20 of the STRA6 gene, resulting in a
thr644-to-met (T644M) substitution. The unaffected parents were not
known to be related. An earlier male sib had died at 24 hours of age
with pulmonary hypoplasia and unilobar left lung, tetralogy of Fallot,
patent ductus arteriosus, undescended testes, horseshoe kidney, and
hypoplastic renal arteries; an earlier female sib died within 24 hours
of birth with bilateral clinical anophthalmia, pulmonary hypoplasia with
unilobar lungs, patent ductus arteriosus, coarctation of the aorta, and
uterine dysplasia.

In a Pakistani female infant with bilateral clinical anophthalmia, left
diaphragmatic hernia, right diaphragmatic eventration, bilateral severe
lung hypoplasia, patent ductus arteriosus, and bicornuate uterus
(MCOPS9; 601186), Pasutto et al. (2007) identified homozygosity for 2
missense mutations in the STRA6 gene. One was a 269C-T transition in
exon 6 that gave rise to a pro90-to-leu (P90L) substitution; the other,
a 961A-C transversion in exon 13, caused a thr321-to-pro (T321P)
substitution (610745.0006). The patient died at 7 hours of age; the
mother had 2 previous midtrimester miscarriages.

In a fetus considered to have the Matthew-Wood syndrome (MCOPS9;
601186), the child of consanguineous Romanian parents, Golzio et al.
(2007) found homozygosity for an insertion/deletion in exon 2 of the
STRA6 gene (52_52delACTinsCC) that resulted in frameshift and premature
termination of the protein (asp17alafsX55). An older brother with
isolated coloboma of the retina and iris was heterozygous for the
mutation, as were the clinically unaffected parents. Intrauterine death
in the proband occurred at 31 weeks' gestation. The anatomic findings
included bilateral anophthalmia, bilateral agenesis of the lungs,
bilateral eventration of the diaphragm, bilateral absence of pulmonary
artery branches, duodenal stenosis, and annular pancreas.

STRA6, 1-BP INS, 527G

In a fetus with Matthew-Wood syndrome (MCOPS9; 601186), the child of
consanguineous Portuguese parents, Golzio et al. (2007) detected a
homozygous insertion of a single basepair in exon 7 of the STRA6 gene,
527_528insG that predicted a premature stop codon (gly176glyfsX59).
Clinical features included bilateral anophthalmia, bilateral agenesis of
the lungs, bilateral eventration of the diaphragm, pulmonary trunk and
pulmonary artery absence, ventricular septal defect, duodenal stenosis,
and absent pancreas. Intrauterine death occurred at 28 weeks' gestation.

.0009
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 9
STRA6, 2-BP INS, 277CC

Analyzing DNA extracted from a paraffin block of autopsy tissue from a
male infant with clinical anophthalmia and diaphragmatic eventration
(MCOPS9; 601186), who was originally reported by Steiner et al. (2002),
West et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for a 2-bp
insertion (277insCC) in exon 2 of the STRA6 gene, predicted to cause a
frameshift and premature stop codon, and a 310G-A transition, also in
exon 2, predicted to result in a trp23-to-ter (W23X) substitution
(610745.0010). The patient was hypotonic at birth, with respiratory
distress requiring ventilator support. Multiple anomalies included flat
face with bitemporal narrowing, bilateral clinical anophthalmia, short
palpebral fissures, mildly prominent nose with anteverted nares, long
philtrum, small jaw, full cheeks, high and arched palate, bilateral
diaphragmatic eventration, cryptorchidism, and bilateral inguinal
hernia. After staged repair of the diaphragm, respiratory distress
worsened and support was withdrawn. At autopsy, the orbits lacked globes
and contained fibroadipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and retinal
rudiments. Other findings included small optic nerves, thin corpus
callosum, ostium primum and fossa ovalis atrial septal defects, severe
right ventricular hypertrophy, and incomplete lobation of the lungs. The
patient had a twin sib who was normal.

STRA6, GLY304LYS

In affected members of a large consanguineous Irish Traveller family
with isolated microphthalmia and coloboma (MCOPCB8; see 601186), Casey
et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 910GG-AA transition in the
STRA6 gene, resulting in a gly304-to-lys (G304K) substitution at a
highly conserved residue in the initial segment of the sixth
transmembrane domain. The mutation was not found in unaffected family
members or in 50 ethnically matched Irish Traveller controls.
Homozygosity for the G304K mutation was also found in 2 more Irish
Traveller probands, a boy with bilateral clinical anophthalmia and a
dysplastic right kidney, and a girl who fulfilled the criteria for
Matthew-Wood syndrome (MCOPS9; 601186). Haplotype analysis supported a
common ancestral origin for the disease mutation in all 3 families.
Transfection studies in COS1 cells demonstrated that the G304K mutation
almost completely abolished vitamin A uptake activity compared to
wildtype. Live-cell staining showed that the G304K mutation led to loss
of cell surface expression of STRA6; permeabilized immunostaining
demonstrated that the G304K mutant was still expressed, suggesting that
the mutation either causes misfolding of STRA6 or interferes with its
targeting mechanism to prevent cell surface expression. Casey et al.
(2011) suggested that the intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity might
be attributed to variability in vitamin A intake and/or uptake by RBP
(180260)/STRA6-independent mechanisms.

In a 2.5-year-old girl with clinical anophthalmia, bushy eyebrows,

(MCOPS9; 601186), Segel et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity
for 2 missense mutations in the STRA6 gene: a 1678G-C transversion in
exon 17, resulting in an asp560-to-his (D560H) substitution, and a
1964G-A transition in exon 19, resulting in an arg655-to-his (R655H;
610745.0013) substitution. The healthy parents were each heterozygous
for 1 of the mutations, neither of which was found in 190 controls.

613962	TITLE *613962 TASTE RECEPTOR, TYPE 2, MEMBER 20; TAS2R20
;;T2R56
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TAS2R20 belongs to the large TAS2R receptor family. TAS2Rs are expressed
on the surface of taste receptor cells and mediate the perception of
bitterness through a G protein-coupled second messenger pathway (summary
by Conte et al., 2002). For further information on the TAS2R gene
family, see 604791.

CLONING

By screening the human genome for sequences related to TAS2Rs, Conte et
al. (2002) cloned TAS2R20, which they called T2R56. The deduced
309-amino acid protein contains the 7-transmembrane structure and short
N- and C-terminal domains conserved in TAS2Rs. The intracellular domains
share significant conservation with other TAS2R family members. TAS2R20
shares highest sequence similarity with TAS2R36.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and genomic sequence analyses, Conte et al.
(2002) mapped the TAS2R20 gene to an approximately 1.2-Mb cluster on
chromosome 12p.

Gross (2011) mapped the TAS2R20 gene to chromosome 12p13.2 based on an
alignment of the TAS2R20 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF494236) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

605981	TITLE *605981 UBIQUITIN-PROTEIN LIGASE E3 COMPONENT N-RECOGNIN 1; UBR1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A number of regulatory circuits involve metabolically unstable proteins.
Short in vivo half-lives are also characteristic of damaged or otherwise
abnormal proteins. Features of proteins that confer metabolic
instability are called degradation signals, or degrons. The essential
component of one degradation signal, called the N-degron, is a
destabilizing N-terminal residue of a protein. The set of amino acids
that are destabilizing in a given cell type yields a rule, called the
N-end rule, which relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the
identity of its N-terminal residue. Similar but distinct versions of the
N-end rule pathway are present in all organisms that have been examined,
from mammals to fungi and bacteria. The N-end rule pathway is one
proteolytic pathway of the ubiquitin system. The recognition component
of this pathway, called N-recognin or E3, binds to a destabilizing
N-terminal residue of a substrate protein and participates in the
formation of a substrate-linked multiubiquitin chain (summary by Kwon et
al., 1998).

CLONING

Kwon et al. (1998) isolated full-length mouse Ubr1 cDNAs and partial
human UBR1 cDNAs, which encode an N-recognin called E3-alpha. The mouse
Ubr1 protein is a 1,757-residue, 200-kD protein that contains regions
with sequence similarity to the 225-kD UBR1 protein of S. cerevisiae.
There are apparent UBR1 homologs in other eukaryotes, thus defining a
distinct family of proteins, the UBR family. The residues essential for
substrate recognition by the yeast UBR1 protein are conserved in the
mouse Ubr1 protein. Regions of similarity among the UBR family members
include a putative zinc finger and RING-H2 finger, another zinc-binding
domain. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression in human
and adult mouse tissues, with highest levels in skeletal muscle and
heart. In mouse embryos, in situ hybridization showed that Ubr1
expression is highest in the branchial arches and in the tail and limb
buds. The authors suggested that the cloning of UBR1 makes possible the
construction of Ubr1-lacking mouse strains, a prerequisite for the
functional understanding of the mammalian N-end rule pathway.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zenker et al. (2005) stated that the UBR1 gene, which encodes one of the
E3 ubiquitin ligases of the N-end rule pathway, spans approximately 161
kb and contains 47 exons. The mouse Ubr1 gene spans approximately 120 kb
of genomic DNA and contains approximately 50 exons (Kwon et al., 1998).

MAPPING

By interspecific backcross analysis, Kwon et al. (1998) mapped the mouse
Ubr1 gene to the middle of chromosome 2. They mapped the human UBR1 gene
to 15q15-q21.1, which shows homology of synteny with mouse chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (JBS; 243800) is an autosomal recessive
disorder that includes congenital exocrine pancreatic insufficiency,
multiple malformations such as nasal wing aplasia, and, frequently,
mental retardation. By homozygosity mapping in 7 kindreds with JBS,
Zenker et al. (2005) mapped the phenotype to 15q14-q21.1. There was no
obvious candidate gene based on putative function and expression data
found in the interval, but by high-throughput direct sequencing of DNA
from individuals with JBS, they eventually detected mutations in the
gene UBR1. In affected individuals from 12 of 13 families included in
the study, the variations likely to be causal mutations were identified
in both alleles of UBR1, whereas in 1 family, only the paternally
inherited mutation was found. Most disease-associated UBR1 alleles (12
of 14) were mutations that predicted premature translational stop
codons. Two missense mutations in UBR1 caused substitutions of residues
that are conserved among UBR1 proteins of different species. One of
these missense mutations, H136R (605981.0001), affected a conserved
motif in the region of UBR1 found to be important for substrate binding
(Tasaki et al., 2005). Two apparently unrelated and nonconsanguineous
families originating from the same district in Costa Rica shared the
same homozygous mutation, Q513X (605981.0003). Haplotype analysis in
these families provided evidence for a common ancestor.

ANIMAL MODEL

To analyze molecular aspects of perturbations in Johanson-Blizzard
syndrome that would be difficult or impossible to address in human
autopsy material, Zenker et al. (2005) used Ubr1 -/- mice. These mice
were viable and fertile and lacked substantial phenotypic abnormalities
other than reduced weight, with disproportionate decreases in skeletal
muscle and adipose tissue (Kwon et al., 2001). Among other findings, the
pancreas of Ubr1 -/- mice was considerably (approximately 100 times)
less responsive to stimulation with the physiologic secretagogue
cholecystokinin (118440). This difference suggested that a signaling
circuit that couples the secretion of pancreatic enzymes to the level of
a secretion-causing compound is controlled by the N-end rule pathway.
Further analysis used an in vivo model of acinar cell stress and
experimental pancreatitis in which supraphysiologic concentrations of
secretagogue resulted in a 'paradoxical' block of pancreatic secretion.
They found that this treatment led to a more severe injury of Ubr1 -/-
pancreas, compared with wildtype, with prominent necrosis in the
deficient pancreas, as indicated by histologic evidence, serum amylase
levels, and other parameters of local pancreatic injury or systemic
inflammatory response. The results suggested that the intact (as
distinguished from Ubr1-deficient) N-end rule pathway contributes to
pancreatic homeostasis and defense against noxious stimuli in pancreatic
acinar cells.

JOHANSON-BLIZZARD SYNDROME
UBR1, HIS136ARG

In a Dutch patient with Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (JBS; 243800) and
nonconsanguineous parents, Zenker et al. (2005) described compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the UBR1 gene: a 407A-G transition in
exon 3 resulting in a his136-to-arg (H136R) amino acid change, and a
splice donor site mutation, IVS20+2T-C (605981.0002).

JOHANSON-BLIZZARD SYNDROME
UBR1, GLN513TER

Zenker et al. (2005) found that 2 apparently unrelated nonconsanguineous
families originating from the same district in Costa Rica shared the
same homozygous mutation, gln513 to stop (Q513X), as the basis of
Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (JBS; 243800). These were Costa Rican Indian
families. Haplotype analysis provided evidence of a common ancestor. The
amino acid change was caused by a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1537
in exon 13.

JOHANSON-BLIZZARD SYNDROME
UBR1, IVS26DS, G-A, +5

In 2 unrelated girls with a mild form of Johanson-Blizzard syndrome
(243800), Elting et al. (2008) identified a homozygous G-to-A transition
in intron 26 of the UBR1 gene. The girls were born of Turkish and
Iranian consanguineous parents, respectively. In addition to the mild
but classic features of the disorder, 1 girl had dilated cardiomyopathy,
whereas the other had a small atrial septal defect. A small amount of
normally spliced mRNA was detected in 1 of the girls, suggesting some
residual normal protein production.

JOHANSON-BLIZZARD SYNDROME
UBR1, IVS12AS, G-A, -1

In a male infant, born of consanguineous Saudi Arabian parents, with
Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (243800), Al-Dosari et al. (2008) identified
a homozygous G-to-A transition in intron 12 of the UBR1 gene, predicted
to result in the skipping of exon 13, a frameshift, and premature
termination. The mutation was not found in 130 control chromosomes. At
birth, the patient had low birth weight, dysmorphic features with
aplastic alae nasi and unusual hair pattern, imperforate anus, hearing
loss, and hypothyroidism. He also developed severe liver involvement
with cholestasis and fibrosis causing liver failure. He did not have
evidence of pancreatic insufficiency.

;;2-PRIME,5-PRIME-@OLIGOADENYLATE SYNTHETASE, 69-KD;;
p69
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The 2-prime,5-prime oligoadenylate synthetases (OASs), such as OAS2, are
interferon-induced proteins characterized by their capacity to catalyze
the synthesis of 2-prime,5-prime oligomers of adenosine (2-5As)
(Hovnanian et al., 1998). For further information on OASs, see OAS1
(164350).

CLONING

Hovanessian et al. (1987) found that interferon-treated human cells
contain several OASs corresponding to proteins of 40 (OAS1), 46 (OAS1),
69 (OAS2), and 100 (OAS3; 603351) kD. Marie et al. (1989) generated
highly specific polyclonal antibodies against p69, the 69-kD OAS. By
screening an interferon-treated human cell expression library with the
anti-p69 antibodies, Marie and Hovanessian (1992) isolated a partial
OAS2 cDNA. They screened additional libraries with the partial cDNA and
recovered cDNAs encoding 2 OAS2 isoforms. The smaller isoform is encoded
by 2 mRNAs that differ in the length of the 3-prime untranslated region.
Northern blot analysis revealed that OAS2 is expressed as 4
interferon-induced mRNAs in human cells. The predicted OAS2 proteins
have a common 683-amino acid sequence and different 3-prime termini. By
SDS-PAGE of in vitro transcription/translation products, the authors
showed that 2 isoforms have molecular masses of 69 and 71 kD. Sequence
analysis indicated that OAS2 contains 2 OAS1-homologous domains
separated by a proline-rich putative linker region. The N- and
C-terminal domains are 41% and 53% identical to OAS1, respectively.
Marie and Hovanessian (1992) suggested that the OAS2 gene derived from
the fusion of 2 ancestral genes analogous to OAS1.

GENE FUNCTION

Marie and Hovanessian (1992) found that both isoforms of human OAS2
exhibited OAS activity in vitro.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by inclusion within mapped
clones, Hovnanian et al. (1998) determined that the OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3
genes are clustered with a 130-kb region on chromosome 12q24.2.

601482	TITLE *601482 DOWNREGULATOR OF TRANSCRIPTION 1, TBP-BINDING; DR1
;;TATA BOX-BINDING PROTEIN-ASSOCIATED PHOSPHOPROTEIN DR1;;
NEGATIVE COFACTOR 2-BETA;;
NC2-BETA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Several phosphoproteins interact with TBP, the TATA box-binding protein
(600075). Among them, DR1 is a TBP-associated phosphoprotein that
represses both basal and activated levels of transcription. Inostroza et
al. (1992) biochemically characterized DR1 purified from HeLa cells and
cloned the human gene from a HeLa cell cDNA library. The gene encodes a
176-amino acid polypeptide of 19 kD. They showed that DR1 is
phosphorylated in vivo and that phosphorylation of DR1 affected its
interaction with TBP.

Using Northern blot analysis, Inostroza et al. (1992) and Mermelstein et
al. (1996) detected varying levels of 1.5- and 3.4-kb DR1 transcripts in
all tissues examined. By Northern blot analysis of rat tissues, Purello
et al. (1996) detected a 3.6 kb mRNA in all tested tissues, with a
second 1.8 kb message in testis. The highest level of expression was
seen in testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Mermelstein et al. (1996) identified DR1-associated protein-1 (DRAP1;
602289), a corepressor of DR1 that enhances DR1-mediated repression of
transcription. Mermelstein et al. (1996) immunodetected DR1 protein in
all cell populations of the developing rat brain: actively dividing stem
cells, nondividing migratory neurons, and nondividing, highly
differentiated neurons. Based on the differential expression of DR1 and
DRAP1 proteins in the developing rat brain, Mermelstein et al. (1996)
suggested that DR1-mediated repression of transcription is higher in
nondividing, highly differentiated cells than in actively dividing
cells.

The DR1 protein contains 3 domains: a histone fold motif at the N
terminus, a TBP-binding domain, and a glutamine- and alanine-rich
region. Mermelstein et al. (1996) showed that the histone fold motif of
DR1 is required for DR1-DRAP1 interaction. Both the TBP-binding domain
and the glutamine- and alanine-rich region are required for DR1-mediated
repression of transcription. Yeung et al. (1997) demonstrated that the
TBP-binding domain has 2 functions: it tethers the DR1 repressor complex
to the promoter by interacting with TBP, and it is required for the
corepression activity of DRAP1, although it is not required for
DR1-DRAP1 interaction. Yeung et al. (1997) determined that the
glutamine- and alanine-rich region is the repressor domain of DR1 and
that this domain interacts with TBP. Goppelt et al. (1996) proposed that
binding of DR1 repressor complexes to TBP-promoter complexes establishes
a mechanism in which an altered DNA conformation, together with the
formation of higher order complexes, inhibits the assembly of the
preinitiation complex and controls the rate of RNA polymerase II
transcription.

Willy et al. (2000) identified an activity that was required for
transcription of downstream promoter element (DPE)-containing core
promoters in vitro. The purified factor was found to be the Drosophila
homolog of the NC2 transcriptional repressor, also known as DR1-DRAP1.
Drosophila Nc2 is composed of a 43-kD subunit homologous to DRAP1
(NC2-alpha) and a 22-kD subunit homologous to DR1 (NC2-beta). Purified
recombinant Drosophila Nc2 activated DPE-driven promoters and repressed
TATA-driven promoters. A mutant version of Drosophila Nc2 could activate
DPE promoters but was unable to repress TATA promoters. Thus, the
activation and repression functions are distinct. Willy et al. (2000)
concluded that NC2 is a bifunctional basal transcription factor that
differentially regulates gene transcription through DPE or TATA box
motifs.

Using mass spectrometry, Wang et al. (2008) identified NC2-beta as a
component of the ADA2A (TADA2A; 602276)-containing (ATAC) histone
acetyltransferase complex in HeLa cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rozet et al. (1996) determined that the DR1 gene contains 3 exons and
spans 15 kb of genomic DNA.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Kamada et al. (2001) determined the x-ray structure of a ternary complex
of NC2, TBP, and DNA at 2.6-angstrom resolution. The N termini of
NC2-alpha and -beta resemble histones H2A (see 613499) and H2B (see
609904), respectively, and form a heterodimer that binds to the bent DNA
double helix on the underside of the preformed TBP-DNA complex via
electrostatic interactions. NC2-beta contributes to inhibition of
TATA-dependent transcription through interactions of its C-terminal
alpha helix with a conserved hydrophobic feature on the upper surface of
TBP, which in turn positions the penultimate alpha helix of NC2-beta to
block recognition of the TBP-DNA complex by transcription factor IIB
(189963).

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Rozet et al. (1996) mapped the
DR1 gene to 1p22.1. Purello et al. (1996) used somatic cell genetics and
fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the DR1 gene to human
chromosome region 1p21-p13. Southern blot analysis showed that the gene
is present as a single copy in the genomes of all eukaryotes examined.

Kaplan et al. (1993) mapped an expressed sequence tag (EST) of the DR1
gene to the YAC contig encompassing the Stargardt disease locus (STGD;
248200) on 1p. Using SSCP analysis of genomic DNA amplified with
specific primers in 10 controls and 35 unrelated patients with either
Stargardt disease (26 patients) or late-onset fundus flavimaculatus, a
condition allelic to STGD (9 patients), Rozet et al. (1996) found no
mutation in the DR1 gene. Rozet et al. (1996) were not able to study the
promoter of the gene, but the findings suggested that DR1 is not
involved in Stargardt disease.

;;RS1
DESCRIPTION D-glucose is absorbed in the small intestine and kidney by
sodium-coupled transport. SGLT1 (182380), SAAT1, and Hu14 are homologous
integral membrane proteins that mediate sodium-driven transport of
D-glucose. A cDNA, pRS1, encoding a membrane-associated protein that
alters sugar transport by SGLT1, was cloned from pig kidney cortex.
Lambotte et al. (1996) cloned the intronless human homolog, termed RS1
by them, encoding a 617-amino acid protein with 74% amino acid identity
to pRS1. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, the RS1 gene was
localized to chromosome 1p36.1. Coexpression of hRS1 and SGLT1 from
human intestine in oocytes showed that hRS1 protein inhibits
sodium-D-glucose cotransporter expressed by human SGLT1 by decreasing
both the V (max) and the apparent K(m) value of the transporter.

610745	TITLE *610745 STIMULATED BY RETINOIC ACID 6; STRA6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Bouillet et al. (1997) cloned mouse Stra6. The deduced 670-amino acid
protein has 9 potential transmembrane domains. RT-PCR detected highest
Stra6 expression in brain, kidney, spleen, testis, and female genital
tract, and much lower expression in heart, lung, and liver.
Immunohistochemical analysis and in situ hybridization of embryonic and
adult mice showed that Stra6 was broadly expressed in a cell
type-specific manner. In adult mice, Stra6 was strongly expressed at
blood-organ barriers. In vitro translation resulted in a protein with an
apparent molecular mass of 74 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using differential subtractive hybridization, Bouillet et al. (1997)
found that expression of Stra6 was upregulated in mouse embryonal
carcinoma cells following treatment with retinoic acid. RT-PCR showed
that Stra6 transcripts accumulated in a time- and retinoic acid
concentration-dependent manner. In mouse Sertoli cells, Stra6 was
expressed in a spermatogenic cell cycle-dependent manner. However, in
testes of retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA; 180240)-null mice, Stra6
was abnormally expressed in all tubules.

Kawaguchi et al. (2007) identified STRA6 as the membrane receptor for
retinol binding protein (RBP1; 180260), which mediates cellular uptake
of vitamin A.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bouillet et al. (1997) determined that the mouse Stra6 gene contains 19
exons.

Pasutto et al. (2007) determined that the human STRA6 gene contains 20
exons.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the STRA6 gene to chromosome 15q24.1 based on an
alignment of the STRA6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF370419) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pasutto et al. (2007) observed 2 unrelated consanguineous families with
malformation syndromes sharing clinical anophthalmia and distinct
eyebrows as common signs, but differing for alveolar capillary dysplasia
or complex congenital heart defect in one and diaphragmatic hernia in
the other family (MCOPS9; 601186). Homozygosity mapping revealed linkage
to a common locus on chromosome 15, and pathogenic homozygous mutations
were identified in STRA6, a member of a large group of 'stimulated by
retinoic acid' genes encoding novel transmembrane proteins,
transcription factors, and secreted signaling molecules or proteins.
Subsequently, Pasutto et al. (2007) demonstrated homozygous STRA6
mutations in 3 of 13 patients chosen on the basis of significant
phenotypic overlap to the original cases. A homozygous deletion
generating a premature stop codon (G50AfsX22; 610745.0002) led to
absence of the immunoreactive protein in the patient's fibroblast
culture. Structural analysis of 3 missense mutations (P90L, 610745.0005;
P293L, 610745.0001; and T321P, 610745.0005) suggested significant
effects on the geometry of the loop connecting the transmembrane helices
of STRA6. Two further variations in the C terminus (T644M, 610745.0004
and R655C, 610745.0003) altered specific functional sites, an
SH2-binding motif and a phosphorylation site, respectively. STRA6
mutations thus define a pleiotropic malformation syndrome representing
the first human phenotype associated with mutations in a gene from the
STRA group.

Retinoic acid is a potent teratogen in all vertebrates when tight
homeostatic controls on its endogenous dose, location, or timing are
perturbed during early embryogenesis. STRA6 encodes an integral cell
membrane protein that favors retinoic acid uptake from soluble
retinol-binding protein; its transcription is directly regulated by
levels of retinoic acid. Golzio et al. (2007) performed molecular
analysis of the STRA6 gene in 2 families with Matthew-Wood syndrome
(MCOPS9; 601186). One of the fetuses had a homozygous insertion/deletion
in exon 2 and the other had a homozygous insertion in exon 7. Both
predicted a premature stop codon in STRA6 transcripts.

Using DNA extracted from a paraffin block of autopsy tissue from a male
infant with clinical anophthalmia and diaphragmatic eventration, who was
originally reported by Steiner et al. (2002), West et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for a 2-bp insertion and a nonsense
mutation, both in exon 2 of the STRA6 gene (610745.0009 and
610745.0010).

Segel et al. (2009) reported a 2.5-year-old girl with clinical
anophthalmia, bushy eyebrows, patent ductus arteriosus, and normal
cognitive development who was compound heterozygous for 2 missense
mutations in the STRA6 gene (610745.0012 and 610745.0013). The authors
suggested that clinical anophthalmia is the major phenotypic effect of
STRA6 mutations and that it may be compatible with normal psychomotor
development.

In a large consanguineous Irish Traveller family with isolated
microphthalmia and coloboma (MCOPCB8; see 601186), Casey et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the STRA6 gene
(G304K; 610745.0011). Homozygosity for the same G304K mutation was
identified in 2 more Irish Traveller probands, 1 with microphthalmia and
dysplastic right kidney, and 1 who fulfilled the criteria for
Matthew-Wood syndrome (MCOPS9). Functional analysis showed that G304K
mutant STRA6 is mislocalized and has severely reduced vitamin A uptake
activity.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a retinoic acid (RA) synthesis inhibitor in zebrafish embryos,
Casey et al. (2011) modeled different levels of RA and observed
dose-dependent microphthalmia. The inhibitor produced developmental eye
defects ranging from mild to severe microphthalmia as well as retinal
pigment epithelium coloboma, also in a range of severity. Other
developmental defects were visible, including defects in heart
morphogenesis, consistent with the role of RA in multiple developmental
processes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 9
STRA6, PRO293LEU

In 2 affected female infants of a consanguineous Turkish family who had
bilateral clinical anophthalmia and variable pulmonary and cardiac
defects (MCOPS9; 601186), Pasutto et al. (2007) identified homozygosity
for an 878C-T transition in exon 12 of the STRA6 gene that resulted in a
pro293-to-leu (P293L) substitution. One infant died at 6 months of age
due to respiratory insufficiency and the other at 2 days of age due to a
complex cyanotic heart defect.

MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 9
STRA6, 1-BP DEL, 145C

In the 14-year-old male proband of a consanguineous Turkish family who
had bilateral clinical anophthalmia, diaphragmatic hernia, atrial and
ventricular septal defects, severe short stature, and profound mental
retardation (MCOPS9; 601186), Pasutto et al. (2007) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion in exon 4 of the STRA6 gene
(145-147delC) that resulted in frameshift and premature termination of
the protein product (G50AfsX22).

.0003
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 9
STRA6, ARG655CYS

In a male infant with bilateral clinical anophthalmia, left
diaphragmatic eventration, and right inguinal hernia (MCOPS9; 601186)
who died at 3 months of age, Pasutto et al. (2007) identified a
homozygous missense mutation, arg655 to cys (R655C), caused by a 1963C-T
transition in exon 20 of the STRA6 gene. The parents were distantly
related. An older brother, who had bilateral clinical anophthalmia,
truncus arteriosus communis with right aortic arch, pulmonary artery
atresia, and patent ductus arteriosus, died at age 22 months due to
thrombosis of the bronchial arterial branches. This child could feed
himself and speak in short sentences and thus showed no evidence of
mental retardation.

MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 9
STRA6, THR644MET

In a female infant with bilateral clinical anophthalmia, right
diaphragmatic hernia, pulmonary hypoplasia, and bilateral hydronephrosis
(MCOPS9; 601186), Pasutto et al. (2007) identified homozygosity for a
1931C-T transition in exon 20 of the STRA6 gene, resulting in a
thr644-to-met (T644M) substitution. The unaffected parents were not
known to be related. An earlier male sib had died at 24 hours of age
with pulmonary hypoplasia and unilobar left lung, tetralogy of Fallot,
patent ductus arteriosus, undescended testes, horseshoe kidney, and
hypoplastic renal arteries; an earlier female sib died within 24 hours
of birth with bilateral clinical anophthalmia, pulmonary hypoplasia with
unilobar lungs, patent ductus arteriosus, coarctation of the aorta, and
uterine dysplasia.

STRA6, PRO90LEU

In a Pakistani female infant with bilateral clinical anophthalmia, left
diaphragmatic hernia, right diaphragmatic eventration, bilateral severe
lung hypoplasia, patent ductus arteriosus, and bicornuate uterus
(MCOPS9; 601186), Pasutto et al. (2007) identified homozygosity for 2
missense mutations in the STRA6 gene. One was a 269C-T transition in
exon 6 that gave rise to a pro90-to-leu (P90L) substitution; the other,
a 961A-C transversion in exon 13, caused a thr321-to-pro (T321P)
substitution (610745.0006). The patient died at 7 hours of age; the
mother had 2 previous midtrimester miscarriages.

STRA6, 3-BP DEL/2-BP INS

In a fetus considered to have the Matthew-Wood syndrome (MCOPS9;
601186), the child of consanguineous Romanian parents, Golzio et al.
(2007) found homozygosity for an insertion/deletion in exon 2 of the
STRA6 gene (52_52delACTinsCC) that resulted in frameshift and premature
termination of the protein (asp17alafsX55). An older brother with
isolated coloboma of the retina and iris was heterozygous for the
mutation, as were the clinically unaffected parents. Intrauterine death
in the proband occurred at 31 weeks' gestation. The anatomic findings
included bilateral anophthalmia, bilateral agenesis of the lungs,
bilateral eventration of the diaphragm, bilateral absence of pulmonary
artery branches, duodenal stenosis, and annular pancreas.

STRA6, 1-BP INS, 527G

In a fetus with Matthew-Wood syndrome (MCOPS9; 601186), the child of
consanguineous Portuguese parents, Golzio et al. (2007) detected a
homozygous insertion of a single basepair in exon 7 of the STRA6 gene,
527_528insG that predicted a premature stop codon (gly176glyfsX59).
Clinical features included bilateral anophthalmia, bilateral agenesis of
the lungs, bilateral eventration of the diaphragm, pulmonary trunk and
pulmonary artery absence, ventricular septal defect, duodenal stenosis,
and absent pancreas. Intrauterine death occurred at 28 weeks' gestation.

.0009
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 9
STRA6, 2-BP INS, 277CC

Analyzing DNA extracted from a paraffin block of autopsy tissue from a
male infant with clinical anophthalmia and diaphragmatic eventration
(MCOPS9; 601186), who was originally reported by Steiner et al. (2002),
West et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for a 2-bp
insertion (277insCC) in exon 2 of the STRA6 gene, predicted to cause a
frameshift and premature stop codon, and a 310G-A transition, also in
exon 2, predicted to result in a trp23-to-ter (W23X) substitution
(610745.0010). The patient was hypotonic at birth, with respiratory
distress requiring ventilator support. Multiple anomalies included flat
face with bitemporal narrowing, bilateral clinical anophthalmia, short
palpebral fissures, mildly prominent nose with anteverted nares, long
philtrum, small jaw, full cheeks, high and arched palate, bilateral
diaphragmatic eventration, cryptorchidism, and bilateral inguinal
hernia. After staged repair of the diaphragm, respiratory distress
worsened and support was withdrawn. At autopsy, the orbits lacked globes
and contained fibroadipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and retinal
rudiments. Other findings included small optic nerves, thin corpus
callosum, ostium primum and fossa ovalis atrial septal defects, severe
right ventricular hypertrophy, and incomplete lobation of the lungs. The
patient had a twin sib who was normal.

STRA6, GLY304LYS

In affected members of a large consanguineous Irish Traveller family
with isolated microphthalmia and coloboma (MCOPCB8; see 601186), Casey
et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 910GG-AA transition in the
STRA6 gene, resulting in a gly304-to-lys (G304K) substitution at a
highly conserved residue in the initial segment of the sixth
transmembrane domain. The mutation was not found in unaffected family
members or in 50 ethnically matched Irish Traveller controls.
Homozygosity for the G304K mutation was also found in 2 more Irish
Traveller probands, a boy with bilateral clinical anophthalmia and a
dysplastic right kidney, and a girl who fulfilled the criteria for
Matthew-Wood syndrome (MCOPS9; 601186). Haplotype analysis supported a
common ancestral origin for the disease mutation in all 3 families.
Transfection studies in COS1 cells demonstrated that the G304K mutation
almost completely abolished vitamin A uptake activity compared to
wildtype. Live-cell staining showed that the G304K mutation led to loss
of cell surface expression of STRA6; permeabilized immunostaining
demonstrated that the G304K mutant was still expressed, suggesting that
the mutation either causes misfolding of STRA6 or interferes with its
targeting mechanism to prevent cell surface expression. Casey et al.
(2011) suggested that the intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity might
be attributed to variability in vitamin A intake and/or uptake by RBP
(180260)/STRA6-independent mechanisms.

In a 2.5-year-old girl with clinical anophthalmia, bushy eyebrows,
patent ductus arteriosus, and normal motor and cognitive development
(MCOPS9; 601186), Segel et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity
for 2 missense mutations in the STRA6 gene: a 1678G-C transversion in
exon 17, resulting in an asp560-to-his (D560H) substitution, and a
1964G-A transition in exon 19, resulting in an arg655-to-his (R655H;
610745.0013) substitution. The healthy parents were each heterozygous
for 1 of the mutations, neither of which was found in 190 controls.

607096	TITLE *607096 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 22 (URATE TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 12; SLC22A12
;;ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER 4-LIKE; OAT4L;;
URATE TRANSPORTER 1; URAT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The SLC22A12 gene encodes URAT1, a renal urate-anion exchanger that
regulates blood urate levels.

CLONING

Enomoto et al. (2002) isolated a SLC22A12 cDNA from a human kidney cDNA
library. The cDNA, which they called URAT1 for 'urate transporter-1,'
corresponds to a gene of 2,642 basepairs encoding a protein of 555 amino
acids that is 42% identical to OAT4 (SLC22A11; 607097). The hydropathy
plot predicts 12 membrane-spanning domains in URAT1, which are similar
to those in members of the OAT family. URAT1 has 3 consensus sequences
for N-glycosylation and 2 cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase
phosphorylation sites. High stringency Northern analysis revealed
predominant expression of URAT1 mRNA in the human adult and fetal
kidney, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that URAT1 protein is
prominent in epithelial cells of the proximal tubule of the renal
cortex. Under high magnification, the protein was found to be located in
the luminal membrane of the epithelium of proximal tubules but not in
that of distal tubules.

GENE FUNCTION

Enomoto et al. (2002) demonstrated that Xenopus oocytes injected with
URAT1 cRNA exhibited time-dependent transport activity of [14C]urate but
not of various typical substrates of OATs or organic cation
transporters. URAT1 was found to be a cotransporter with anions, in
particular chloride, bromide, or iodine, but not fluoride. Enomoto et
al. (2002) found that urate transport via URAT1 is inhibited selectively
by organic anions such as lactate, nicotinate, acetoacetate,
hydroxybutyrate, and succinate. Para-aminohippurate (PAH), the
representative substrate of OATs, did not exert an inhibitory effect on
urate uptake via URAT1, consistent with the observation that PAH has no
effect on the fractional excretion of urate in humans. Benzbromarone,
probenecid, phenylbutazone, sulfinpyrazone, nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs, and diuretics inhibited urate uptake.
Trans-stimulation experiments indicated that the major counteranions
that exchange for urate via URAT1 are organic anions rather than
inorganic chloride.

Thangaraju et al. (2006) found the urinary excretion of urate was
significantly elevated in Cebpd (116898) -/- mice, although expression
of Urat1 was unaltered. However, expression of the Na(+)/lactate
cotransporters Slc5a8 (608044) and Slc5a12 (612455) was almost
completely ablated in Cebpd -/- mice. Thangaraju et al. (2006) proposed
that lactate reabsorption by SLC5A8 and SLC5A12 is coupled to urate
reabsorption by URAT1 at the proximal tubule apical membrane.

MAPPING

Enomoto et al. (2002) identified a sequence representing the SLC22A12
gene within a BAC clone (GenBank GENBANK AC044790) mapping to chromosome
11q13, near the SLC22A11 gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with renal hypouricemia (220150), Enomoto et al. (2002) and
Tanaka et al. (2003) identified mutations in the SLC22A12 gene
(607096.0001-607096.0003).

Ichida et al. (2008) identified SLC22A12 mutations in 66 of 71 71
Japanese patients with hypouricemia. The W258X mutation (607096.0001)
was by far the most common mutation, occurring in 93 alleles, including
31 homozygotes and 23 compound heterozygotes. A total of 13 mutations,
including 3 novel mutations, were identified (see, e.g. 607096.0005;
607096.0006). Acute renal failure and urolithiasis occurred in 21.1% and
8.5% of patients, respectively. Three patients had chronic renal
failure. By haplotype analysis, Ichida et al. (2008) found that W258X
was a founder mutation with an estimated age of 6,820 years.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, TRP258TER

In a 48-year-old male with idiopathic renal hypouricemia (220150),
Enomoto et al. (2002) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 774
within exon 4 of the SLC22A12 gene, resulting in a tryptophan-to-stop
substitution at codon 258 (W258X). This mutation was found in
homozygosity and was not identified in 180 randomly chosen control
Japanese individuals.

In 2 brothers with hereditary renal hypouricemia and exercise-induced
acute renal failure, Tanaka et al. (2003) identified homozygosity for
the W258X mutation. The parents of the sibs and all of the sibs' 5
children were heterozygous for the mutation.

By haplotype analysis of 31 Japanese individuals homozygous for the
W258X mutation, Ichida et al. (2008) estimated that the mutation is
about 6,820 years old. This mutation dates back from between the time
when the Jomon people predominated in Japan and the time when the Yayoi
people started to migrate to Japan from the Korean peninsula.

.0002
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, THR217MET

In a patient with idiopathic renal hypouricemia (220150), Enomoto et al.
(2002) identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 650 in exon 3 of the
SLC22A12 gene, resulting in a threonine-to-methionine substitution at
codon 217 (T217M). This mutation was found in homozygosity and was not
identified in any of 180 randomly chosen control Japanese individuals.

.0003
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, GLU298ASP

In a patient with idiopathic renal hypouricemia (220150), Enomoto et al.
(2002) identified a G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 894 in exon 5 of
the SLC22A12 gene, resulting in a glutamic acid-to-aspartic acid
substitution at codon 298 (E298D). This mutation was found in
homozygosity and was not identified in any of 180 randomly chosen
control Japanese individuals.

.0004
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, LEU418ARG

In the affected member of a Japanese family with renal hypouricemia
(220150), Wakida et al. (2005) detected compound heterozygosity for
W258X (607096.0001) and for a novel mutation, a 1253T-G transversion in
the SLC22A12 gene that resulted in a leu418-to-arg (L418R) substitution
in the tenth transmembrane domain of the protein. The L418R mutation had
significantly reduced urate-transporting activities compared with
wildtype (P less than 0.05), suggesting that it is a loss-of-function
mutation.

.0005
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, ARG90HIS

In a Japanese man with renal hypouricemia (220150), Ichida et al. (2008)
identified a homozygous 269G-A transition in the SLC22A12 gene,
resulting in an arg90-to-his (R90H) substitution. Nine additional
affected individuals were compound heterozygous for R90H and W258X
(607096.0001).

.0006
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, GLY361VAL

In 2 unrelated Japanese individuals with renal hypouricemia (220150),
Ichida et al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations
in the SLC22A12 gene: a 1082G-T transversion resulting in a
gly361-to-val (G361V) substitution, and W258X (607096.0001). In vitro
functional expression assays showed that the G361V-mutant protein had
decreased uric acid transport activity.

605210	TITLE *605210 DISRUPTED IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 1; DISC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DISC1 regulates multiple aspects of embryonic and adult neurogenesis
(Kim et al., 2009).

CLONING

Millar et al. (2000) isolated and sequenced a translocation breakpoint
region on chromosome 1q42 that had been identified by St. Clair et al.
(1990) in a large Scottish family with mental and/or behavioral
disorders, including schizophrenia (see 604906), schizoaffective
disorder, recurrent major depression, and adolescent conduct and
emotional disorders. Within the 1q42 chromosomal region, Millar et al.
(2000) identified 2 novel genes directly disrupted by the translocation,
which the authors termed 'disrupted in schizophrenia' 1 and 2 (DISC1 and
DISC2, 606271). The major DISC1 gene is predicted to encode an 854-amino
acid protein containing a globular N-terminal domain and a helical
C-terminal domain with the potential to form a coiled-coil by
interaction with another protein(s). Northern blot analysis identified a
7.5-kb mRNA transcript with ubiquitous expression. DISC2 apparently
specifies a single exon thought to be a noncoding RNA molecule that is
antisense to DISC1, an arrangement that has been observed at other loci
where the antisense RNA may regulate expression of the sense gene.
Millar et al. (2000) suggested that DISC1 and DISC2 may confer
susceptibility to psychiatric illnesses.

Ma et al. (2002) cloned and characterized mouse Disc1, which encodes an
851-amino acid protein that shares 56% sequence identity with the human
protein. Both the mouse and human genes show conservation of leucine
zipper and coiled-coil domains. In situ hybridization in adult mouse
brain showed a restricted expression pattern, with highest levels in the
dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and lower expression in CA1-CA3 of the
hippocampus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and olfactory bulbs. Ozeki et
al. (2003) cloned and characterized mouse and rat Disc1.

Using Western blot analysis of human brain tissue and cultured human
cell lines, Sawamura et al. (2005) found that the DISC1 protein was
expressed as 2 distinct bands of 95 to 100 kD and 75 to 85 kD.
Subcellular fractionation showed that the 95- to 100-kD isoform was
enriched in the cytoplasm, whereas the 75- to 85-kD isoform was present
in both the nucleus and cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Ozeki et al. (2003) demonstrated that rodent Disc1 expression displayed
pronounced developmental regulation, with the highest levels in late
embryonic life during development of the cerebral cortex. In a yeast
2-hybrid assay of a human whole brain cDNA library, DISC1 interacted
with a variety of cytoskeletal proteins. One of these, NUDEL (NDEL1;
607538), is associated with cortical development and is linked to LIS1
(601545). A schizophrenia-associated DISC1 mutant with a C-terminal
257-residue truncation did not bind NUDEL. Expression of mutant DISC1,
but not wildtype DISC1, reduced neurite extension in rat adrenal
pheochromocytoma cells.

Using yeast 2-hybrid, mammalian 2-hybrid, and coimmunoprecipitation
assays, Morris et al. (2003) showed that DISC1 interacts with multiple
proteins of the centrosome and cytoskeletal system, including MIPT3
(607380), MAP1A (600178), and NUDEL; proteins that localize receptors to
membranes, including alpha-actinin-2 (ACTN2; 102573) and beta-4-spectrin
(SPTBN4; 606214); and proteins that transduce signals from membrane
receptors, including ATF4 (604064) and ATF5 (606398). Truncated mutant
DISC1 failed to interact with ATF4, ATF5, or NUDEL. Deletion mapping
demonstrated that DISC1 has distinct interaction domains: MAP1A
interacts via its LC2 domain with the N terminus of DISC1, whereas MIPT3
and NUDEL bind via their C-terminal domains to the central coiled-coil
domain of DISC1, and ATF4/5 bind via their C-terminal domains to the C
terminus of DISC1. In its full-length form, the DISC1 protein localized
to predominantly perinuclear punctate structures which extended into
neurites in some cells; mutant truncated DISC1, by contrast, was seen in
a diffuse pattern throughout the cytoplasm and abundantly in neurites.
Both forms colocalized with the centrosomal complex, although truncated
less abundantly than full-length DISC1. Although both full-length and
mutant DISC1 were found in microtubule fractions, neither form appeared
to bind directly to microtubules, but rather did so in a MIPT3-dependent
fashion that was stabilized by taxol. Morris et al. (2003) concluded
that DISC1 is a multifunctional protein whose truncation may contribute
to schizophrenia susceptibility by disrupting intracellular transport,
neurite architecture, and/or neuronal migration.

Millar et al. (2005) showed that DISC1 interacts with the UCR2 domain of
phosphodiesterase-4B (PDE4B; 600127), implicated in susceptibility to
schizophrenia, and that elevation of cellular cAMP leads to dissociation
of PDE4B from DISC1 and in increase in PDE4B activity. The
phosphodiesterases inactivate cAMP, a second messenger implicated in
learning, memory, and mood. Millar et al. (2005) proposed a mechanistic
model whereby DISC1 sequesters PDE4B in resting cells and releases it in
an activated state in response to elevated cAMP.

Kamiya et al. (2005) identified Disc1 as a component of the
microtubule-associated dynein motor complex in rat PC12 neural precursor
cells. Disc1 was essential for maintaining the motor complex at the
centrosome. A schizophrenia-associated C-terminally truncated Disc1
mutant functioned in a dominant-negative manner by interacting with and
redistributing wildtype Disc1 and by disassociating the Disc1-dynein
complex from the centrosome. Depletion of endogenous Disc1 by RNA
interference or expression of truncated Disc1 impaired neurite outgrowth
in PC12 cells in vitro. In embryonic mice, Disc1 RNA interference led to
impaired cerebral cortex development. Kamiya et al. (2005) concluded
that loss of normal DISC1 function during cerebral cortex development
may underlie neurodevelopmental dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Sawamura et al. (2005) analyzed the 75- to 85-kD isoform of DISC1 in
postmortem orbitofrontal cortex from 3 groups of 15 individuals with
schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder, respectively, and
15 controls. There was an increased P:S ratio (nuclear
pellet:postnuclear supernatant) in schizophrenia and major depression
compared to controls; the increase in bipolar disorder did not reach
statistical significance. The P:S ratio changes in major depression were
significantly influenced by substance/alcohol abuse and by postmortem
interval. The alteration in schizophrenic brains was not associated with
confounding factors, although an interaction with substance/alcohol
abuse could not be ruled out.

Burdick et al. (2008) noted that NDE1 (609449) is a homolog of NDEL1 and
also binds to DISC1. NDE1 was expressed at constant levels in the rat
cerebral cortex from embryonic day (E) 14 to adulthood, whereas NDEL1
expression showed a time-course increase peaking at postnatal day 7.
Further studies with a ser704-to-cys (S704C) polymorphism in the DISC1
gene showed that NDE1 bound stronger to ser704, while NDEL1 bound
stronger to cys704. The findings suggested an interaction of these 3
proteins, with possible competitive binding between NDEL1 and NDE1 for
DISC1.

Using knockdown studies, Mao et al. (2009) found that Disc1 was required
for neural progenitor cell proliferation in vitro, during embryonic
mouse brain development, and in adult mouse dentate gyrus. Disc1
interacted directly with Gsk3-beta (GSK3B; 605004) and inhibited
recombinant Gsk3-beta activity in a dose-dependent manner. This
inhibition of Gsk3-beta caused reduced phosphorylation and increased
stabilization of beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806). Knockdown of Disc1 in
adult mouse dentate gyrus resulted in hyperactivity and depression-like
behaviors. All effects of Disc1 knockdown were reversed by pharmacologic
inhibition of Gsk3-beta. Mao et al. (2009) concluded that DISC1
regulates neural progenitor proliferation by modulating GSK3-beta
activity and beta-catenin abundance.

By immunoprecipitation analysis of cotransfected HEK293 cells, Enomoto
et al. (2009) found that mouse Disc1 interacted with girdin (CCDC88A;
609736), a protein required for proper migration and positioning of
mouse dentate gyrus cells. Domain mapping revealed that the N-terminal
globular domain of Disc1 interacted with the N-terminal domain of
girdin. Girdin colocalized with Disc1 in cultured rat hippocampal
neurons, and knockdown of Disc1 via small interfering RNA impaired
girdin localization at growth cones.

Kim et al. (2009) found that adenovirus-mediated delivery of Kiaa1212
(CCDC88A) or a short hairpin RNA targeting Disc1 in adult mouse newborn
neurons caused elevated Akt (AKT1; 164730) signaling and resulted in a
migratory and positioning defect in the manipulated neurons. Disc1
knockdown or Kiaa1212 overexpression also caused an increase in neuronal
soma size and accelerated primary dendrite branching. Disc1 and Kiaa1212
coimmunoprecipitated from cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, dissected
adult mouse hippocampus, and transfected HEK293 cells. Direct
interaction of Disc1 with Kiaa1212 prevented Kiaa1212-dependent
activation of Akt signaling, and knockdown of Kiaa1212 abrogated
Disc1-dependent downregulation of Akt signaling. Pharmacologic blockage
of Mtor (FRAP1; 601231) also abrogated the effects of Disc1 knockdown or
Kiaa1212 overexpression, suggesting that Mtor is a major downstream
mediator of this signaling pathway.

Ishizuka et al. (2011) reported that phosphorylation of DISC1 acts as a
molecular switch from maintaining proliferation of mitotic progenitor
cells to activating migration of postmitotic neurons in mice.
Unphosphorylated DISC1 regulates canonical Wnt signaling via an
interaction with GSK3-beta, whereas specific phosphorylation at
serine-710 triggers the recruitment of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (see
209900) proteins to the centrosome. In support of this model, loss of
BBS1 (209901) leads to defects in migration, but not proliferation,
whereas DISC1 knockdown leads to deficits in both. A phospho-dead mutant
can only rescue proliferation, whereas a phospho-mimic mutant rescues
exclusively migration defects. Ishizuka et al. (2011) concluded that
their data highlight a dual role for DISC1 in corticogenesis and
indicate that phosphorylation of this protein at serine-710 activates a
key developmental switch.

By Western blot analysis of 60 fractionated postmortem brain samples
divided approximately evenly between individuals diagnosed with chronic
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or depression, and normal controls,
Leliveld et al. (2008) found that DISC1 partitioned in the insoluble
pellet in a subset of cases with psychiatric disease. In transfected
human neuroblastoma cells, when DISC1 was expressed at low levels, it
interacted with endogenous NDEL1; in contrast, when DISC1 was expressed
at high levels, it became insoluble and did not interact with NDEL1.

Using transfected COS-7 cells and cultured rat neurons, Atkin et al.
(2012) found that overexpressed human DISC1 accumulated in perinuclear
aggregates. Insoluble DISC1 recruited endogenous DISC1 away from the
mobile pool of DISC1 puncta and disrupted mitochondrial movement.
Treatment of cultured rat neurons with hydrogen peroxide shifted the
distribution of endogenous Disc1 to an insoluble fraction. Inhibition of
the proteasome or lysosome acidification increased the number of
DISC1-containing aggregates, suggesting that overexpressed DISC1 was
recruited to the aggresome-autophagy pathway for protein removal. Atkin
et al. (2012) concluded that insoluble DISC1 associates with aggresomes
and negatively impacts neuronal function.

Eastwood et al. (2010) found that the DISC1 binding partner PCM1
(600299) was localized to the centrosome in glia of human superior
temporal gyrus, but not in neurons, which showed widespread
immunoreactivity. The authors quantified centrosomal PCM1
immunoreactivity in superior temporal gyrus glia of 81 controls and 67
subjects with schizophrenia, and genotyped the subjects for the 2 DISC1
polymorphisms leu607 to phe (dbSNP rs6675281) and ser704 to cys (dbSNP
rs821616). Centrosomal PCM1 immunoreactive area was smaller in cys704
carriers than in ser704 homozygotes, with a similar trend in phe607
homozygotes compared with leu607 carriers. No differences were seen
between controls and subjects with schizophrenia. The authors concluded
that DISC1 coding variants modulate centrosomal PCM1 localization, and
proposed a role for DISC1 in glial function that may be altered in
psychiatric disorders.

MAPPING

Ma et al. (2002) determined that the mouse Disc1 gene maps to chromosome
8 in a region with homology of synteny to human chromosome 1q42. Ma et
al. (2002) demonstrated that translin-associated factor X (TSNAX;
602964), which is situated 35 kb proximal to the DISC1 sequence on human
chromosome 1, is located approximately 20 kb proximal to Disc1 in the
mouse at 69.5 cM.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The family studied by St. Clair et al. (1990) and Millar et al. (2000)
was originally ascertained by Jacobs et al. (1970), who reported the
translocation in the propositus, who had adolescent conduct disorder,
and in members of 4 generations of the extended family. Blackwood et al.
(2001) provided a follow-up. Of the 87 members of the family who were
karyotyped, 37 carried the (1;11)(q42;q14.3) translocation. A
psychiatric diagnosis was reached in 29 carriers, 38 noncarriers, and
the 2 founders (who were not karyotyped). The range of symptoms in this
family crossed traditional diagnostic boundaries, and the locus
identified by the breakpoint on 1q42 appeared to be implicated in either
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (125480). Furthermore, Blackwood
(2000) reported abnormalities in the auditory P300 event-related
potential, which showed prolonged latency and reduced amplitude in
affected members of the family.

Ekelund et al. (2001) used a large, population-based study sample (221
Finnish families, 557 affected individuals) to refine the localization
of schizophrenia loci on chromosome 1q. The results were analyzed
separately for families originating from an internal isolate of Finland
and for families from the rest of Finland, as well as for all families
jointly. Evidence for linkage was obtained for 1 locus in the combined
sample (maximum lod = 2.71, D1S2709) and in the nuclear families from
outside the internal isolate (maximum lod = 3.21, D1S2709). In the
families from the internal isolate the strongest evidence for linkage
was obtained with markers located 22 cM centromeric from this marker
(maximum lod = 2.30, D1S245). The strongest evidence for linkage in the
combined study sample was obtained for marker D1S2709, which is a marker
within DISC1. In a follow-up study to Ekelund et al. (2001), Ekelund et
al. (2004) genotyped 300 polymorphic markers on chromosome 1 using a
sample of 70 Finnish families with multiple individuals affected with
schizophrenia or related conditions. They again found linkage on
chromosome 1q42 maximizing within the DISC1 gene (dbSNP rs1000731, lod
of 2.70).

By analysis of SNPs and corresponding haplotypes across candidate genes
in the 1q42 region identified by Ekelund et al. (2001) as being linked
to schizophrenia in a Finnish sample, Hennah et al. (2003) identified a
significant region of interest within the DISC1 gene. They identified a
2-SNP haplotype spanning from intron 1 to exon 2 of the DISC1 gene,
designated HEP3 (605210.0001), and demonstrated that it was
undertransmitted to affected women in the general Finnish population.
The HEP3 haplotype also displayed sex differences in transmission
distortion, the undertransmission being significant only in affected
females. Hodgkinson et al. (2004) presented data from a case-control
study of a North American white population, confirming the
underrepresentation of the HEP3 haplotype in individuals with
schizoaffective disorder. Multiple haplotypes contained within 4
haplotype blocks extending between exon 1 and exon 9 were associated
with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder.
Hodgkinson et al. (2004) also found overrepresentation of a missense
allele of the DISC1 gene, leu607 to pro (L607P; dbSNP rs6675281) in
schizoaffective disorder. These data supported the idea that these
apparently distinct disorders have at least a partially convergent
etiology and that variation at the DISC1 locus predisposes individuals
to a variety of psychiatric disorders.

Cannon et al. (2005) conducted a population-based twin cohort study in
Finland to examine the association of SNPs of DISC1 and TRAX (TSNAX;
602964) with schizophrenia and several endophenotypic traits thought to
be involved in the disease pathogenesis. Two hundred and thirty-six
subjects consisting of 7 pairs concordant for schizophrenia (6
monozygotic, 1 dizygotic), 52 pairs discordant for schizophrenia (20
monozygotic, 32 dizygotic), and 59 demographically balanced normal pairs
(28 monozygotic, 31 dizygotic) were drawn from a twin cohort consisting
of all same-sex twins born in Finland from 1940 through 1957. Diagnosis
was confirmed and performance on neurocognitive tests of short- and
long-term memory as well as gray matter volume measurements as assessed
on MRI images were recorded. A common haplotype incorporating 3 SNPs
near the translocation breakpoint of DISC1 (HEP1; odds ratio, 2.6; p =
0.02) and a rare haplotype incorporating 4 markers from the DISC1 and
TRAX genes (combined HEP2/HEP3; odds ratio, 13.0; p = 0.001) were
significantly overrepresented among individuals with schizophrenia.
These haplotypes were also associated with several quantitative and
endophenotypic traits including impairments in short- and long-term
memory, functioning, and reduced gray matter density in the prefrontal
cortex.

Song et al. (2008) analyzed the regions of likely functional
significance in the DISC1 gene in 288 patients with schizophrenia and
288 controls. Six patients with schizophrenia were heterozygous for
'ultra-rare' missense variants (R37W, S90L, T603I, G14A, and R418H) not
found in 288 controls (p = 0.015) and shown to be ultra-rare by their
absence in a pool of 10,000 control alleles. Song et al. (2008)
concluded that these variants in DISC1 are associated with an
attributable risk of about 2% for schizophrenia. In addition, they
replicated the finding that 2 common structural variants (Q264R and
S704C) slightly elevate the risk for schizophrenia (OR, 1.3, 95% CI,
1.0-1.7).

Schumacher et al. (2009) reported a circumscribed interval in intron 9
of DISC1, which was significantly associated with schizophrenia in
females (p = 4.0 x 10(-5)) and contributed most strongly to early-onset
cases (p = 9.0 x 10(-5)) in a central European population of 1,621
individuals. The SNP interplay effect between dbSNP rs1538979 and dbSNP
rs821633 significantly conferred disease risk in male patients with
schizophrenia (p = 0.016; OR, 1.57). In a metaanalysis of 9
schizophrenia samples from different European populations covering 50
SNPs, the authors found evidence for a common schizophrenia risk
interval within DISC1 introns 4 to 6 (p = 0.002; OR, 1.27). Schumacher
et al. (2009) proposed a complex association between schizophrenia and
DISC1, including the presence of different risk loci and SNP interplay
effects.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hikida et al. (2007) developed a transgenic mouse model expressing a
dominant-negative truncated form of human DISC1. In vivo brain MRI
showed enlarged lateral ventricles particularly on the left side in
juvenile mutant mice, similar to asymmetric brain changes observed in
patients with schizophrenia. There was also selective reduction of
immunoreactivity to parvalbumin (PVALB; 168890) in the cortex, marking a
possible interneuron deficit. Mutant mice displayed several behavioral
abnormalities, including hyperactivity, disturbances in sensorimotor
gating and olfactory-associated behavior, and an
anhedonia/depression-like deficit. Hikida et al. (2007) suggested that
the dominant-negative human DISC1 transgenic mouse could be an animal
model for schizophrenia.

Li et al. (2007) used an inducible and reversible transgenic system to
demonstrate that early postnatal, but not adult induction, of mutant
C-terminal DISC1 in mice resulted in a cluster of schizophrenia-related
phenotypes, including reduced hippocampal dendritic complexity,
decreased hippocampal synaptic transmission, depressive-like traits,
abnormal spatial working memory, and reduced sociability. Li et al.
(2007) postulated that alterations in DISC1 function during brain
development may contribute to pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

Clapcote et al. (2007) reported the behavioral phenotypes of 2
ENU-induced Disc1 mouse mutants: Q31L and L100P, both in exon 2. All
mutant mice were viable and grossly indistinguishable from their
wildtype littermates. L110P-mutant mice showed a schizophrenic-like
phenotype, with decreased prepulse inhibition and latent inhibition that
could be ameliorated by antipsychotic treatment. In contrast,
Q31L-mutant mice showed depressive-like behavior, with deficits in the
forced swim test and other measures that could be reversed by treatment
with the antidepressant buproprion, but not by rolipram, a PDE4
inhibitor. Brain MRI showed decreased brain volume in L100P-mutant mice
(decreased by 13%) and L31-mutant mice (decreased by 6%). Both mutant
Disc1 proteins showed decreased binding to PDE4B, and Q31L-mutant mice
had decreased PDE4B activity in the brain.

Kvajo et al. (2008) generated mice carrying a deletion in the mouse
Disc1 gene, resulting in premature termination, that modeled the
disease-associated translocation identified in humans and associated
with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder by Blackwood et al. (2001).
Mutant mice had alterations in the organization of newly born and mature
neurons of the dentate gyrus. Field recordings showed a deficit in
short-term plasticity in the hippocampus of mutant mice. Both homozygous
and heterozygous mutant mice showed a selective impairment in working
memory during a battery of cognitive tests. The results were consistent
with malfunction of neural circuits.

Wood et al. (2009) mapped the expression of zebrafish Disc1 and studied
its role in early embryonic development using morpholino antisense
methods. There was a critical requirement for Disc1 in oligodendrocyte
development by promoting specification of Olig2 (606386)-positive cells
in the hindbrain and other brain regions. Disruption of neuregulin
(Nrg1; 142445) and ErbB (EGFR; 131550) signaling in zebrafish brain
development yielded similar defects to those seen in disc1 morphant
embryos. Knockdown of Disc1 or Nrg1 caused near total loss of
Olig2-positive cerebellar neurons, but caused no apparent loss of spinal
motor neurons. Wood et al. (2009) suggested that Disc1 and Nrg1 function
in common or related pathways controlling development of
oligodendrocytes and neurons from Olig2-expressing precursor cells.

In developing mouse hippocampus, Meyer and Morris (2009) showed that in
utero electroporation of Disc1 short hairpin RNAs hindered the migration
of dentate gyrus granule cells. Disc1 knockdown did not affect the
migration of CA1 pyramidal neurons, suggesting that the role of Disc1 in
regulating neuronal migration may be spatially restricted within the
hippocampus. Meyer and Morris (2009) suggested that DISC1 abnormalities
that contribute to the onset of schizophrenia may do so through their
influences on hippocampal development.

Using in utero RNA interference transfer, Niwa et al. (2010) showed that
transient knockdown of Disc1 in prefrontal cortex in mice at embryonic
day 14 led to maturation-dependent deficits in mesocortical dopaminergic
projections and associated behavioral changes, including those in
information processing and cognition.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SCHIZOPHRENIA 9
DISC1, HAPLOTYPE, HEP3

Hennah et al. (2003) identified a common haplotype, HEP3, that was
undertransmitted in Finnish females with schizophrenia (SCZD9; 604906).
The HEP3 haplotype contains 2 SNPS in the DISC1 gene (dbSNP rs751229,
dbSNP rs3738401) that span 62 kb from intron 1 to exon 2. Hodgkinson et
al. (2004) confirmed underrepresentation of the HEP3 haplotype in
individuals with schizoaffective disorder.

Hennah et al. (2005) tested whether identified allelic haplotypes of
TRAX (602964)/DISC were associated with visual or verbal memory
dysfunction known to aggregate with schizophrenia in families. The HEP3
haplotype of DISC1 displayed association with poorer performance on
tests assessing short-term visual memory and attention. Analysis of
affected and unaffected offspring separately revealed that both samples
contributed to the observed association in visual working memory. The
results provided genetic support for the view that the DISC1 gene
contributes to sensitivity to schizophrenia and affects short-term
visual memory functions.

Among Finnish twin pairs discordant for the HEP3 haplotype, Li et al.
(2007) found a significant association between presence of the haplotype
and decreased sociability, suggesting that DISC1 has an effect on social
behavior.

601914	TITLE *601914 PROLINE ARGININE-RICH END LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT PROTEIN; PRELP
DESCRIPTION PRELP (proline arginine-rich end leucine-rich repeat protein) is a
connective tissue glycoprotein of the leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) family.
The LRR motif is believed to participate in protein-protein
interactions; Bengtsson et al. (1995) stated that this motif is found in
several matrix-binding proteins. Bengtsson et al. (1995) isolated the
58-kD PRELP protein from bovine articular cartilage and cloned the human
PRELP cDNA from an articular chondrocyte cDNA library. Sequencing
revealed that the gene encodes a 382-amino acid polypeptide with a
calculated molecular mass of 42 kD. The protein sequence contains a
putative secretory signal sequence, 10 leucine-rich repeats, several
glycosylation sites, and a proline- and arginine-rich N-terminus. They
reported that the protein sequence was 36% similar to fibromodulin
(600245) and 33% similar to bovine lumican (see 600616).

Grover et al. (1996) characterized the expression pattern and genomic
structure of human PRELP. They determined that PRELP is encoded by
messages of 1.7, 4.6, and 6.7 kb, in descending order of expression
level. The messages are abundant in juvenile and adult cartilage, but
not present in neonatal cartilage nor in cultured fibroblasts. Among
other adult tissues, PRELP is expressed in lung. Grover et al. (1996)
reported that the PRELP gene contains 2 introns. They mapped the gene to
human chromosome 1q32; interestingly, the fibromodulin gene also resides
at this location.

608398	TITLE *608398 CUB AND SUSHI MULTIPLE DOMAINS 2; CSMD2
;;KIAA1884
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned CSMD2, which they designated
KIAA1884. The CSMD2 transcript contains an Alu repeat in the 3-prime
untranslated region. RT-PCR detected intermediate expression in fetal
brain, adult brain, spinal cord, and all specific adult brain regions
examined. Lower levels were detected in spleen, lung, and testis, and
little to no expression was detected in the other tissues examined.

By screening databases using the partial KIAA1884 clone obtained by
Nagase et al. (2001), followed by RT-PCR of a fetal brain cDNA library
and 5-prime RACE, Lau and Scholnick (2003) cloned full-length CSMD2. The
deduced 3,487-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
about 380 kD. Like CSMD1 (608397), CSMD2 contains 14 alternating CUB and
sushi domains, followed by 12 additional tandem sushi domains (CSMD1 has
14), a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail that
contains putative phosphorylation sites. Unlike CSMD1 and CSMD3
(608399), CSMD2 does not have a signal peptide.

GENE FUNCTION

Lau and Scholnick (2003) detected expression of CSMD2 at levels greater
than expected in 5 of 18 squamous cell carcinoma cell lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lau and Scholnick (2003) determined that the CSMD2 gene contains 70
exons and spans about 651 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis using 2 genomic databases, Lau and
Scholnick (2003) determined that the CSMD2 gene maps to chromosome
1p34.3 or chromosome 1p35.3.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

High molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) plays an important role in
assembly of the plasma kallikrein (see 147910)-kinin system. The KNG1
gene generates both HMWK and low molecular weight kininogen (LMWK)
through alternative splicing. Both HMWK and LMWK contain an identical
heavy chain consisting of protein domains 1, 2, and 3. However, HMWK
contains a 56-kD light chain that consists of domains 5 and 6H, whereas
LMWK contains a unique 4-kD light chain that consists of domain 5L. In
both proteins, the heavy and light chains are linked by domain 4, which
contains the bradykinin (BK) nonapeptide. BK, which is released by
plasma kallikrein, is a potent inflammatory mediator that causes
vasodilation and enhanced capillary permeability, induces pain, and
stimulates production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin (see 601699) from
endothelial cells. During vascular damage, BK stimulates smooth muscle
proliferation and intimal hypertrophy. Release of BK from HMWK generates
a 2-chain HMWK, termed HMWKa, containing the heavy and light chains
joined by a disulfide bond (Merkulov et al., 2008).

CLONING

In the 1970s, a number of similar patients with abnormal coagulation
tests but no apparent bleeding tendency were identified and described as
lacking a coagulation factor variously termed Fitzgerald factor,
Flaujeac factor, or Williams factor, among other names (see 228960). At
first the nature of these factors was uncertain, but further studies
showed that they were identical to high molecular weight kininogen
(Davie, 1979; Giangrande, 2003).

Takagaki et al. (1985) isolated human cDNAs encoding the HMW and LMW
prekininogens. They determined that the HMW and LMW prekininogen mRNAs
are identical throughout the 5-prime UTR and the protein-coding region
up to the sequence encoding the 12 amino acids distal to the BK
sequence, after which the 2 mRNAs completely diverge. The HMW and LMW
prekininogens contain 626 and 427 amino acids, respectively. They share
a common signal peptide, heavy chain, and BK moiety, which consist of
18, 362, and 9 amino acids, respectively. The unique light chains of HMW
and LMW prekininogens consist of 255 and 38 amino acids, respectively.
There are 17 cysteines in both the bovine and human heavy chain,
indicating that the human heavy chain, like its bovine counterpart, can
form 8 loops, each connected by 2 adjacent cysteines.

Merkulov et al. (2008) determined that the mouse genome contains 2
kininogen genes, Kng1 and Kng2, that are 91% identical. Using RT-PCR,
they found that Kng1 was expressed predominantly in liver and adrenal
gland, whereas Kng2 was expressed predominantly in kidney, with lower
expression in liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kitamura et al. (1985) determined that the KNG1 gene contains 11 exons
and spans 27 kb. Exons 1 through 9 encode the 5-prime UTR and the signal
peptide and heavy chain sequences common to both HMWK and LMWK. Exon 10
encodes the common sequence for BK and the unique sequence for HMWK, and
exon 11 encodes the unique sequence for LMWK.

MAPPING

Fong et al. (1991) mapped the KNG gene to chromosome 3 using
human-hamster somatic cell hybrids and the PCR of hybrid DNA with
gene-specific primers. KNG was further assigned to chromosome 3q26-qter
using DNA from a second panel of chromosome 3 deletion mapping cell
hybrids. Cheung et al. (1992) also mapped the KNG gene to chromosome
3q26-qter by in situ hybridization. The assignment substantiated the
evolutionary relationship of kininogen to 2 other members of the
cystatin superfamily, alpha-2HS-glycoprotein (AHSG; 138680) and
histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG; 142640), which also map to the long
arm of chromosome 3.

Merkulov et al. (2008) determined that the 2 mouse kininogen genes, Kng1
and Kng2, are located in a head-to-head orientation on chromosome 16.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Cheung et al. (1993) demonstrated that Ms. Williams, the patient with
total kininogen deficiency (228960) reported by Colman et al. (1975),
was homozygous for a nonsense mutation in the KNG1 gene (612358.0001).

Krijanovski et al. (2003) found that a 6-year-old boy with cerebral
artery thrombosis and HMWK deficiency was homozygous for a 1-bp deletion
of 1492A in the KNG1 gene (612358.0002), corresponding to amino acid 480
of the mature protein. The mutation resulted in a frameshift and
premature termination at amino acid 532 of the mature protein. Each
parent and a sib were heterozygous for the mutation. Krijanovski et al.
(2003) found that truncation or frameshift at or before position 480 of
mature HMWK prevented biosynthesis, processing, and/or secretion of the
protein into plasma. Krijanovski et al. (2003) also identified the
causative mutation in Fitzgerald trait as a 17-bp substitution in intron
9 of the KNG1 gene (612358.0003). They provided a diagram comparing the
molecular defects of Williams trait (612358.0001), their reported
deletion of 1492A, and Fitzgerald trait with normal HMWK.

Using immunoblot and Southern blot analyses, Hayashi et al. (1990)
detected no molecular abnormality of kininogen in the DNA from patients
from 4 Japanese families with total kininogen deficiency or from 1
patient with isolated HMWK deficiency. However, in the patient with
isolated HMWK deficiency, a partial deletion in intron 7 was found by
restriction analysis. This partial deletion was assumed to be related to
an abnormality of alternative splicing of HMW prekininogen mRNA.
However, Shigekiyo et al. (2007) found that this patient with isolated
HMWK deficiency was homozygous for a 1-bp insertion (C) at nucleotide
1217 in exon 10 of the KNG1 gene (612358.0004). The insertion resulted
in a frameshift in codon 406 and a premature stop signal in codon 415.
The patient's parents and brother were heterozygous for the mutation.

- Association with Decreased Activated Partial Thromboplastin
Time

Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is considered a global test
of thrombotic tendency. A shortened aPTT is associated with an increased
risk of thrombosis as well as several prothrombotic risk factors
including age, female sex, estrogen use, and obesity. Prolonged aPTT is
an indicator of coagulation disorders in patients with deficiencies of
factors in the intrinsic pathways of coagulation. Houlihan et al. (2010)
conducted a genomewide association study for activated partial
thromboplastin time (aPTT) in a total of 1,477 relatively healthy adults
from the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1936 (LBC1936) and 1921 (LBC1921). A
highly significant association with a relatively large effect size was
found between aPTT and a SNP in the KNG1 gene, dbSNP rs710446 (combined
p = 9.52 x 10(-22)). The SNP dbSNP rs710446 represents a missense
change, ile581 to thr (I581T, 1742T-C), in exon 10 of kininogen 1
isoform 1. The effects of dbSNP rs710446 were additive, with each G
allele decreasing aPTT by 0.36 standard deviations. This SNP explained
5.2% and 8.1% of the variance in aPTT in LBC1936 and LBC1921,
respectively. Mutations in KNG1 cause high molecular weight kininogen
(HMWK) deficiency, an autosomal recessive coagulation defect; Kng1
knockout mice demonstrate prolonged aPTT and delayed arterial thrombosis
(Merkulov et al., 2008).

Among 1,542 European patients with venous thrombosis (see 188050) and
1,110 controls, Morange et al. (2011) found a significant association
between the C allele of dbSNP rs710446 and risk of thrombosis (odds
ratio (OR) of 1.196; p = 0.0012) A borderline association was observed
in a small independent sample of 590 controls and 596 patients (OR of
1.171; p = 0.059). This allele was also associated with decreased aPTT
levels. Morange et al. (2011) concluded that the I581T variant is a
genetic risk factor for venous thrombosis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Merkulov et al. (2008) found that Kng1 -/- mice were viable and appeared
normal, although they lacked plasma HMWK and LMWK. Kng1 -/- mice showed
normal tail vein bleeding times, but they displayed significantly
prolonged time to vessel occlusion in an induced arterial thrombosis
model.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
KININOGEN DEFICIENCY, TOTAL
KNG1, ARG196TER

In the patient (Ms. Williams) with total kininogen deficiency (228960)
reported by Colman et al. (1975) as having Williams trait, Cheung et al.
(1993) found homozygosity for a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 22 in
exon 5 (nucleotide 587 of the cDNA) of the KNG1 gene, resulting in a CGA
(arg)-to-TGA (stop) mutation in exon 5. All 3 daughters were found to be
heterozygous and a granddaughter was found to be normal. In the proband,
both high and low molecular weight kininogens were completely absent;
the 3 daughters had approximately 50% high molecular weight kininogen
and the granddaughter had normal high molecular weight kininogen. Using
the amino acid count according to Nakanishi, which includes the signal
peptide, Kunapuli (1993) determined that the amino acid altered was
arg196.

HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT KININOGEN DEFICIENCY
KNG1, 1-BP DEL, 1492A

Krijanovski et al. (2003) described studies of the plasma and DNA of a
6-year-old male, born of first-cousin parents, with cerebral artery
thrombosis and HMWK deficiency (228960). The previously healthy child
had headache and vomiting 10 days after moderate cerebral trauma,
followed by loss of consciousness and subsequent visual impairment. CT
scan and angiography showed extensive left vertebral-basilar artery
thrombosis and a left vertebral artery dissection. The patient had a
prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and received
fresh frozen plasma before arteriography and then daily for 8 days,
which resulted in normalization of the APTT and resolution of neurologic
symptoms. There was full neurologic recovery with warfarin anticoagulant
therapy for 6 months, and there had been no recurrence after 2 years of
follow-up. The child had no high molecular weight kininogen procoagulant
activity and antigen (less than 1%). He was found to be homozygous for
deletion of an adenine at cDNA position 1492 in exon 10 of the KNG1
gene, corresponding to position 480 of the mature protein. The mutation
resulted in a frameshift and premature termination at amino acid 532 of
the mature protein. Each parent and a sib were heterozygous for the same
defect. Krijanovski et al. (2003) found that truncation or frameshift at
or before position 480 of mature HMWK prevented biosynthesis,
processing, and/or secretion of the protein into plasma.

.0003
HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT KININOGEN DEFICIENCY
KNG1, 17-BP DEL/17-BP INS, NT1559

The first plasma with HMWK deficiency (228960) to be recognized was
derived from an African American of the surname Fitzgerald (Waldmann et
al., 1975). Studying DNA prepared from a more that 25-year-old frozen
plasma specimen, Krijanovski et al. (2003) determined that the KNG1
defect in Fitzgerald trait resides in intron 9, with substitution of 17
consecutive basepairs at nucleotides 1559 through 1575. The substituted
segment had 1559T and 1575A at its 2 ends and consisted of 5 TGT
triplets, which in Fitzgerald DNA were changed to 5 GTG triplets, the
end nucleotides being changed to 1559G and 1575G. Also at nucleotide
position 1578, a GT sequence in normal DNA was changed to TG in
Fitzgerald intron 9. Furthermore, in Fitzgerald intron 9, single
basepair polymorphisms were found at nucleotide positions 119 (C to T),
1586 (T to G), and 1736 (A to G).

.0004
HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT KININOGEN DEFICIENCY
KNG1, 1-BP INS, 1217C

Using restriction analysis, Hayashi et al. (1990) found that a Japanese
patient with isolated HMWK deficiency (228960) had a partial deletion in
intron 7 of the KNG1 gene. This partial deletion was assumed to be
related to an abnormality of alternative splicing of HMW prekininogen
mRNA. However, Shigekiyo et al. (2007) found that this patient with
isolated HMWK deficiency was homozygous for a 1-bp insertion (C) at
nucleotide 1217 in exon 10 of the KNG1 gene. The insertion resulted in a
frameshift in codon 406 and a premature stop signal in codon 415. The
patient's brother and parents, who were second cousins, were
heterozygous for the mutation.

610656	TITLE *610656 CYSTEINE CONJUGATE BETA-LYASE 2; CCBL2
;;KYNURENINE AMINOTRANSFERASE III; KAT3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Kynurenic acid (KYNA), a metabolite of tryptophan, is a broad-spectrum
antagonist of excitatory amino acid receptors, suggesting it may
participate in normal brain function as a modulator of glutamatergic
neurotransmission. The level of KYNA is altered in several
neurodegenerative diseases. KAT3 is a kynurenine aminotransferase that
forms KYNA by transamination of kynurenine (Yu et al., 2006).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to KAT1 (CCBL1; 600547) and
KAT2 (AADAT; 611754), followed by PCR of brain cDNA libraries, Yu et al.
(2006) cloned mouse and human CCBL2, which they called KAT3. The deduced
454-amino acid human protein has a calculated molecular mass of 51.4 kD
and shares 83.7% identity with mouse Kat3. Yu et al. (2006) also
identified a human KAT3 splice variant that lacks exon 2 and encodes a
deduced 420-amino acid protein. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues
detected strong expression in liver, kidney, and heart, and weaker
expression in brain and testis. Expression of Kat3 increased in mouse
tissues from postnatal day 7 through 17.

GENE FUNCTION

Yu et al. (2006) noted that Kat2 -/- mice have lower hippocampal KYNA
levels and are hyperactive compared with wildtype mice, but these
abnormalities occur early and are transitory. Yu et al. (2006) found
that Kat1 and Kat3 expression, when measured together, was higher in
Kat2 -/- mice at postnatal day 60, but not at postnatal days 7, 14, 21,
or 28, compared with wildtype mice. The increased Kat1 and Kat3
expression paralleled restoration of the normal phenotype in Kat2 -/-
mice. Yu et al. (2006) concluded that upregulation of Kat1 and Kat3
compensates for loss of Kat2 in Kat2 -/- mice.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yu et al. (2006) determined that the CCBL2 gene contains 14 exons and
spans about 143 kb. The first exon is noncoding.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Yu et al. (2006) mapped the CCBL2 gene to
chromosome 1p22.2. They mapped the mouse Ccbl2 gene to chromosome 3.

612959	TITLE *612959 EPITHELIAL SPLICING REGULATORY PROTEIN 1; ESRP1
;;RNA-BINDING MOTIF PROTEIN 35A; RBM35A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ESPR1 is an epithelial cell-type-specific splicing regulator (Warzecha
et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using a cell-based cDNA expression screen with human embryonic kidney
293T cells, Warzecha et al. (2009) identified mouse Esrp1 and Esrp2
(612960) as regulators of FGFR2 (176943) splicing. By database analysis,
they identified human ESRP1, which encodes a deduced 681-amino acid
protein containing 3 central RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). Comparison
of ESRP orthologs in diverse species showed significant sequence
conservation within the RRM domains, particularly RRM1. In situ
hybridization of neonatal and adult mice revealed distinct
epithelial-specific expression of Esrp1 in diverse tissues and organs,
with highest expression in skin and gastrointestinal epithelia.

GENE FUNCTION

Cell type-specific expression of epithelial and mesenchymal isoforms of
FGFR2 is achieved through tight regulation of mutually exclusive exons
IIIb and IIIc, respectively. Warzecha et al. (2009) showed that
expression of epitope-tagged mouse Esrp1 or Esrp2 in 293T cells induced
a substantial switch of endogenous FGFR2 transcripts from the
mesenchymal form with exon IIIc to the epithelial form with exon IIIb.
Microarray analysis revealed that cell lines classified as epithelial
expressed higher levels of ESRP1 and/or ESRP2 than cell lines classified
as mesenchymal. Depletion of ESRP1 and ESRP2 in a human prostate
epithelial cell line via RNA interference (RNAi) caused a significant
switch from exon IIIb to exon IIIc splicing in the endogenous FGFR2
transcript. Rescue experiments with mouse cDNAs showed that FGFR2-IIIb
splicing was more dependent on ESRP1 than ESRP2. RNAi experiments
revealed that ESRP1 and ESRP2 also regulated splicing of CD44 (107269),
CTNND1 (601045), and ENAH (609061), transcripts that undergo changes in
splicing during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the ESRP1 gene to chromosome 8q22.1 based on an
alignment of the ESRP1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK00178) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

612385	TITLE *612385 MEDIATOR COMPLEX SUBUNIT 19; MED19
;;LUNG CANCER METASTASIS-RELATED PROTEIN 1; LCMR1;;
DT2P1G7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MED19 is a component of the Mediator complex, which is a coactivator for
DNA-binding factors that activate transcription via RNA polymerase II
(Sato et al., 2003).

CLONING

By searching a human brain cDNA library for clones containing a CAG
repeat, Reddy et al. (1997) identified MED19, which they called DT2P1G7.
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.3-kb MED19 transcript.

Using HeLa cells overexpressing epitope-tagged MED10 (612382), Sato et
al. (2003) purified several components of the human Mediator complex,
including MED19, which they called LCMR1, and subsequently cloned the
corresponding cDNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro-translated epitope-tagged proteins for protein-binding
assays, Sato et al. (2003) found MED19 directly interacted with Mediator
subunits SOH1 (MED31), TRAP80 (MED17; 603810), and TRAP37 (MED27;
605044). Interaction between MED19 and SOH1 was confirmed by
coimmunoprecipitation analysis of transfected 293T cells and insect
cells.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Reddy et al. (1997) mapped the MED19 gene
to chromosome 11q11.

;;TBP1-INTERACTING PROTEIN; TBPIP;;
GT198;;
HOP2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; HOP2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PSMC3IP gene encodes a nuclear, tissue-specific protein with
multiple functions, including a role in meiotic recombination and as a
coactivator of ligand-dependent transcription mediated by nuclear
hormone receptors (summary by Zangen et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing putative genes centromeric to the BRCA1 gene (113705) on
chromosome 17, followed by screening a breast cancer cell line cDNA
library, Rommens et al. (1995) cloned GT198. The deduced protein
contains 203 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.6-kb
transcript in all adult and fetal tissues examined, with abundant
expression in testis, colon, a breast cancer cell line, and a lymphoma.

Tanaka et al. (1997) cloned Gt198, which they called Tbpip, from a mouse
testis cDNA library. The deduced 217-amino acid protein has several
putative phosphorylation sites. RT-PCR detected Tbpip expression in CD4
(186940)-positive T cells and in macrophages. In situ hybridization
found Tbpip mRNA colocalized with Tbp1 (186852) in seminiferous tubules
of adult mouse testis. Western blot analysis detected Tbpip at an
apparent molecular mass of 24 kD. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse
testis detected Tbpip in nuclei of primary and secondary spermatocytes.

By PCR using primers designed from mouse Tbpip, Ijichi et al. (2000)
cloned full-length human TBPIP from breast cancer cell line mRNA and a
testis cDNA library. The deduced 217-amino acid protein contains an
acidic region near the C terminus and several putative phosphorylation
sites. Mouse and human TBPIP share 88% amino acid homology.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rommens et al. (1995) mapped the TBPIP
gene to chromosome 17q21. Using radiation hybrid analysis, Ijichi et al.
(2000) mapped the TBPIP gene to chromosome 17q12-q21.

GENE FUNCTION

The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) regulatory protein Tat is
essential for HIV-1 gene expression and replication in infected cells.
TBP1 is a cellular protein that suppresses Tat-mediated transactivation
of HIV replication. Tanaka et al. (1997) found that mouse Tbpip
synergistically cooperated with Tbp1 to suppress Tat-mediated
transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter.

Ijichi et al. (2000) showed that human TBPIP interacted directly with
TBP1 and enhanced TBP1-mediated inhibition of HIV Tat-mediated
transactivation.

Enomoto et al. (2006) demonstrated that coexpression of human MND1
(611422) and HOP2 in E. coli resulted in the formation of stable
heterodimers. The HOP2-MND1 complex stimulated DMC1 (602721)- and RAD51
(179617)-mediated DNA strand exchange, and preferentially bound to a
3-stranded DNA branch, which mimics the strand-exchange intermediate.
Enomoto et al. (2006) concluded that the HOP2-MND1 complex may ensure
proper pairing between homologous chromosomes by stimulating strand
exchange during meiosis.

Chi et al. (2007) found that the Hop2 component of the mouse recombinant
Hop2-Mnd1 complex was the major DNA-binding subunit, and that Mnd1 was
the Rad51-interacting entity. Hop2-Mnd1 stabilized the
Rad51-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) nucleoprotein filament, and enhanced
the ability of the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament to capture duplex
DNA, which is an obligatory step in the formation of the synaptic
complex critical for DNA joint formation. Pezza et al. (2007) showed
that the mouse Hop2-Mnd1 complex stimulated Dmc1 to promote synaptic
complex formation on long duplex DNAs. Synaptic alignment was a
consequence of the ability of Hop2-Mnd1 to stabilize the Dmc1-ssDNA
nucleoprotein complex and facilitate the conjoining of DNA molecules
through the capture of double-stranded DNA by the Dmc1-ssDNA
nucleoprotein filament.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large consanguineous Arab Palestinian pedigree with
hypergonadotropic ovarian dysgenesis mapping to chromosome 17 (ODG3;
614324), Zangen et al. (2011) analyzed candidate genes and identified
homozygosity for a 3-bp deletion in the PSMC3IP gene (608665.0001) that
segregated with disease in the family. In cell lines, the glu201del
mutation abolished PSMC3IP activation of estrogen-driven transcription.

ANIMAL MODEL

Petukhova et al. (2003) found that Hop2 knockout mice showed no gross
anomalies in somatic tissues but developed a profound deficiency in
gametogenesis. Hop2 -/- spermatocytes arrested at the stage of
pachytene-like chromosome condensation. Axial elements were fully
developed, but synapsis was limited. While meiotic double-stranded
breaks were formed and processed in Hop2 -/- mice, they failed to be
repaired.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OVARIAN DYSGENESIS 3
PSMC3IP, 3-BP DEL, 600GAG

In affected members of a large consanguineous Arab Palestinian pedigree
with hypergonadotropic ovarian dysgenesis (ODG3; 614324), Zangen et al.
(2011) identified homozygosity for an in-frame 3-bp deletion in the
acceptor splice junction of exon 8 of the PSMC3IP gene, resulting in
deletion of glu201. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
deletion, which was not found in 254 ethnically matched chromosomes.
RT-PCR analysis of leukocyte DNA from affected and unaffected family
members showed no alternative splicing, suggesting that the mutation
does not affect PSMC3IP splicing. Transfection studies in the IGROV1
ovarian carcinoma and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines demonstrated that
the glu201del mutation abolished PSMC3IP activation of estrogen-driven
transcription.

605170	TITLE *605170 ETOPOSIDE-INDUCED 1.4 mRNA; EI24
;;EI24, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF;;
p53-INDUCED GENE 8; PIG8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The EI24 gene is an immediate-early response gene that is directly
regulated by p53 (TP53; 191170), suppresses cell growth, and induces
cell death (Gu et al., 2000).

CLONING

DNA damage and/or hyperproliferative signals activate wildtype p53 tumor
suppressor protein (TP53; 191170), inducing cell cycle arrest or
apoptosis. Mutations that inactivate p53 occur in 50% of all tumors.
Polyak et al. (1997) used serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) to
evaluate cellular mRNA levels in a colorectal cancer cell line
transfected with p53. Of 7,202 transcripts identified, only 14 were
expressed at levels more than 10-fold higher in p53-expressing cells
than in control cells. Polyak et al. (1997) termed these genes
'p53-induced genes,' or PIGs, several of which, including PIG8, were
predicted to encode redox-controlling proteins. They noted that reactive
oxygen species (ROS) are potent inducers of apoptosis. Flow cytometric
analysis showed that p53 expression induces ROS production, which
increases as apoptosis progresses under some conditions. The authors
stated that PIG8 is the human homolog of murine ei24, an
etoposide-induced gene.

By analysis of a BAC clone, Gu et al. (2000) determined that the PIG8
sequence reported by Polyak et al. (1997) is incorrect and that the
corrected 358-amino acid PIG8 protein shares 98% amino acid identity
with ei24. Western blot analysis indicated that ei24 expression is
approximately 500-fold higher in dead cells than in healthy cells. Phase
contrast and fluorescence microscopy showed that cells expressing Ei24
but not those coexpressing the apoptosis suppressor BCL2L1 (600039)
displayed the typical morphologic features of apoptosis. These results
suggested that ei24 suppresses cell growth through the activation of an
apoptotic pathway.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a murine myeloid leukemia cell line expressing a
temperature-sensitive p53 gene, Gu et al. (2000) showed that ei24, the
murine homolog of PIG8, directly responds to p53 as an immediate-early
response gene and is not induced secondary to p53-mediated cell death.
Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis demonstrated that purified
wildtype p53 protein specifically binds to a p53 response element in the
ei24 protein.

MAPPING

By FISH, Gu et al. (2000) mapped the PIG8 gene to 11q23, a region
frequently altered in cancers. Gu et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Ei24
gene to the proximal region of chromosome 9.

602597	TITLE *602597 B-CELL CLL/LYMPHOMA 9; BCL9
;;LEGLESS, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; LGS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Studying a cell line (CEMO-1) from a patient with precursor-B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia with a t(1;14)(q21;q32), Willis et al. (1998)
identified a fusion partner of the IGHJ gene (147010) on 14q. One allele
showed novel sequences upstream of JH5 with no homology to either IGH or
any other sequence in databases. Using a single-copy restriction
fragment immediately 5-prime of JH5, PAC clones were isolated and mapped
to 1q21 on normal metaphases by fluorescence in situ hybridization,
confirming that this allele represented the translocation breakpoint.
Sequence analysis of the 1q21 restriction fragment showed identity with
an expressed sequenced tag, and this probe was therefore used to probe
Northern blots. Willis et al. (1998) designated the gene on 1q21 BCL9.
Sequence analysis predicted a protein of 1,394 amino acids, with no
recognizable protein motifs or significant homologies to known proteins.
The CEMO-1 1q21 breakpoint fell within the 3-prime untranslated region
(UTR) of the BCL9 gene. By screening of a panel of 39 B-cell
malignancies with 1q abnormalities by Southern blotting, Willis et al.
(1998) found 1 additional case with a breakpoint in the 3-prime UTR of
BCL9, indicating that this is a recurrent breakpoint. Fluorescence in
situ hybridization analysis using an 850-kb YAC spanning BCL9 identified
a further case of t(1;22)(q21;q11) causing juxtaposition of BCL9 to the
IGL locus (147220).

MAPPING

By analysis of a translocation t(1;14)(q21;q32) breakpoint, Willis et
al. (1998) mapped the BCL9 gene to chromosome 1q21.

GENE FUNCTION

WNT (see 602863) signaling controls many fundamental processes during
animal development. WNT transduction is mediated by the association of
beta-catenin (116806) with nuclear TCF (e.g., LEF1; 153245) DNA-binding
factors. Kramps et al. (2002) identified 2 segment polarity genes in
Drosophila, legless (Lgs), and pygopus (Pygo), and showed that their
products are required for WNT signal transduction at the level of
nuclear beta-catenin. Lgs encodes the homolog of human BCL9, and the
authors provided genetic and molecular evidence that these proteins
exert their function by physically linking Pygo to beta-catenin. Kramps
et al. (2002) identified 2 human homologs of the Drosophila Pygo gene,
PYGO1 (606902)and PYGO2 (606903), that possess a highly conserved PHD
finger that interacts with homology domain-1 (HD1) of BCL9. The findings
suggested that the recruitment of PYGO permits beta-catenin to
transcriptionally activate WNT target genes and raised the possibility
that a deregulation of these events may play a causal role in the
development of B-cell malignancies.

601958	TITLE *601958 CALCIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT, BETA-3 SUBUNIT; CACNB3
;;CALCIUM CHANNEL, L TYPE, BETA-3 POLYPEPTIDE; CACNLB3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Collin et al. (1994) isolated the beta subunit of a human
voltage-dependent calcium channel gene from a 9-week-old human
total-embryo cDNA library. The gene encodes a 482-amino acid polypeptide
with a predicted mass of 54,571 kD. The gene, called H beta 3 by them,
was expressed mostly in brain, smooth muscle, and ovary.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yamada et al. (1995) described the exon-intron structure of the CACNLB3
gene, which spans approximately 8 kb and comprises 13 exons.

MAPPING

Collin et al. (1994) localized the CACNB3 gene to chromosome 12q13 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the interaction between calcium
channel alpha-1 (see 601011) and beta subunits, Chen et al. (2004)
determined the crystal structures of the conserved core region of beta-3
(CACNB3), alone and in complex with the alpha-interaction domain (AID),
and of beta-4 (CACNB4; 601949) alone. The structures showed that the
beta subunit core contains 2 interacting domains: a Src homology 3 (SH3)
domain and a guanylate kinase domain. The AID binds to a hydrophobic
groove in the guanylate kinase domain through extensive interactions,
conferring extremely high affinity between alpha-1 and beta subunits.
The beta-interaction domain (BID) is essential both for the structural
integrity of and for bridging the SH3 and guanylate kinase domains, but
it does not participate directly in binding alpha-1.

NOMENCLATURE

Lory et al. (1997) provided a unified nomenclature for voltage-gated
calcium channel genes (see 114207), tabulated 12 of these genes, and
gave the map location of each.

ANIMAL MODEL

Murakami et al. (2002) noted that the accessory beta-3 subunits of
calcium channels are preferentially associated with the alpha-1b subunit
(CACNA1B; 601012) in neuronal N-type channels. By gene targeting, they
deleted the beta-3 subunit in mice and found that the mutation dampened
the processing of painful stimuli, specifically pain induced by chemical
inflammation. The ascending pain pathways of the spinal chord showed
altered N-type channel activity. In vitro binding studies and
pharmacologic manipulation indicated reduced expression of alpha-1b
subunits in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Murakami et al. (2002)
concluded that, since beta-3 controls the membrane targeting of alpha-1
subunits, the loss of beta-3 reduced the number of N-type calcium
channels present in the membranes of DRG neurons and dampened their
response to inflammatory stimuli.

Berggren et al. (2004) found that Cacnb3 -/- mice showed a more
efficient glucose homeostasis compared with wildtype mice due to
increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The increased insulin
secretion resulted from increased glucose-induced cytoplasmic free
Ca(2+) concentration oscillation frequency in Cacnb3 -/- beta cells, an
effect accounted for by enhanced formation of inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and increased Ca(2+) mobilization from
intracellular stores. Berggren et al. (2004) concluded that CACNB3
negatively modulates InsP3-induced Ca(2+) release without affecting the
function of the voltage-gated L-type Ca(2+) channel.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned ANKRD12, which they designated
KIAA0874. The deduced protein contains 601 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected moderate expression in brain, kidney, heart, lung, liver,

164015	TITLE *164015 MATRIN 3; MATR3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Stuurman et al. (1990) showed that nuclear matrins, a group of proteins
in the nuclear matrix, are present in cultured cells from a variety of
tissues and are probably common to mammalian cells. Stuurman et al.
(1990) differentiated 2 nuclear matrix fractions: the peripheral nuclear
matrix (matrix proteins that remain insoluble after reduction), and the
internal nuclear matrix (matrix proteins released by reduction).

Nakayasu and Berezney (1991) identified several novel nuclear matrins
from a rat liver nuclear matrix and characterized them by peptide maps,
polyclonal antibodies generated against the individual matrins, and
indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. They designated the proteins
matrins 3, 4, D-G, 12, and 13.

Belgrader et al. (1991) cloned a full-length rat insulinoma cDNA that
encodes an acidic internal matrix protein designated matrin-3. The
deduced 845-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
approximately 95 kD. Its primary structure consists of 33% charged
residues and is generally hydrophilic. Like the lamins (see 150330),
matrin-3 has a positively charged N terminus that contains a large
number of amino acids with free hydroxyl groups. A highly acidic domain
near the C terminus, in which 32% of the amino acids are acidic, is a
characteristic found in other nuclear proteins.

Nagase et al. (1998) cloned and sequenced matrin-3, which they called
KIAA0723, from human brain cDNA libraries. The deduced protein contains
847 amino acids.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MATR3
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP WI-15469).

Using genomic sequence analysis, Senderek et al. (2009) mapped the MATR3
gene to chromosome 5q31.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 unrelated families with a form of distal myopathy that included
vocal cord and pharyngeal weakness (MPD2; 606070), Senderek et al.
(2009) identified the same missense mutation in the MATR3 gene (S85C;
164015.0001).

In affected members of a North American family originally reported by
Feit et al. (1998) and in an unrelated Bulgarian family with distal
myopathy with vocal cord and pharyngeal weakness (MPD2; 606070),
Senderek et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a C-to-G
transversion at nucleotide 254 in exon 2 of the MATR3 gene that resulted
in a change from serine to cysteine at codon 85 (S85C).

FIBROUS SHEATH PROTEIN, 95-KD; FSP95;;
SPERM OOCYTE-BINDING PROTEIN 1; SOB1
DESCRIPTION A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs; see 602449) direct the activity of
protein kinase A (PKA; see 176911) by tethering the enzyme near its
physiologic substrates.

Lefevre et al. (1999) purified and sequenced a human sperm
oocyte-binding protein (SOB1). Using degenerate PCR primers based on the
peptide sequences of SOB1, they obtained a cDNA encoding a novel member
of the AKAP family, AKAP3. The deduced 853-amino acid protein has 4
N-glycosylation sites, 26 phosphorylation sites, 8 N-myristoylation
sites, and 1 amidation site. Northern blot analysis revealed expression
of an approximately 3-kb transcript in testis only.

Independently, Vijayaraghavan et al. (1999) cloned human AKAP3, which
they designated AKAP110, and its murine and bovine homologs. Western
blot analysis determined that the RII binding site is in the N terminus
and comprises residues 124 to 141. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of an approximately 3.6-kb transcript in testis only. In situ
hybridization analysis showed restricted expression in round spermatids.
Spermatozoa stained with anti-AKAP3 exhibited intense fluorescence of
the anterior acrosome and along the entire flagellum of bovine sperm,
suggesting that AKAP3 associates with both the RI and RII subunits of
PKA. By immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, Mandal et al.
(1999) determined that human AKAP3 localizes to the ribs of the fibrous
sheath in the principal piece of the sperm tail.

By Southern blot analysis, Lefevre et al. (1999) demonstrated that AKAP3
is a single copy gene. Mandal et al. (1999) determined that AKAP3 has 5
exons separated by 4 introns.

By FISH, Mandal et al. (1999) and Lefevre et al. (1999) mapped the AKAP3
gene to chromosome 12p13.

;;p34
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AP1 and AP2 are heterotetrameric complexes involved in clathrin-coated
vesicle trafficking that associate with the trans-Golgi network (TGN)
and plasma membrane, respectively. AAGAB, or p34, interacts with the
gamma-adaptin (AP1G1; 603533) subunit of AP1 and with the alpha-adaptin
(AP2A1; 601026) subunit of AP2 (Page et al., 1999).

CLONING

Using mouse gamma-adaptin in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a rat brain cDNA
library, Page et al. (1999) cloned Aagab, which they called p34. The
deduced protein contains 315 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
detected variable Aagab expression in all rat tissues examined.

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 15 linked to punctate
palmoplantar keratoderma type I (PPKP1A; 148600), followed by PCR of a
human keratinocyte cDNA library, Giehl et al. (2012) cloned full-length
AAGAB. RT-PCR analysis detected AAGAB expression in hair follicle cells,
skin, HaCaT keratinocytes, and lymphocytes, with highest relative
expression in HaCaT cells. Database analysis suggested ubiquitous AAGAB
expression. Immunohistochemical analysis of normal palmoplantar skin
detected granular cytoplasmic AAGAB staining, particularly in the
stratum basale and the first suprabasal cell layers of the stratum
spinosum. Much weaker staining was detected in upper layers of the
stratum spinosum, where it localized only around nuclei in a few
keratinocytes. Dermal vessels were also AAGAB positive.

Independently, Pohler et al. (2012) cloned AAGAB by RT-PCR of HaCaT cell
total RNA. The deduced 315-amino acid protein contains a RAB (see
179508)-like GTPase domain in its N-terminal half and an adaptin-binding
domain in its C-terminal half. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed
AAGAB expression in all 48 human tissues examined, with highest
expression in rectum and thymus, followed by adrenal gland, spleen,
uterus, and vagina. Lowest expression was detected in mammary gland.
Fluorescence-tagged AAGAB was expressed in cytosol, but not in membrane
or clathrin-coated vesicle fractions, of HaCaT and HeLa cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Independently, Giehl et al. (2012) and Pohler et al. (2012) determined
that the AAGAB gene contains 10 exons. Pohler et al. (2012) reported
that the AAGAB gene spans 53.7 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Giehl et al. (2012) mapped the AAGAB gene
to chromosome 15q22.33-q23.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Page et al. (1999) found that rat p34
interacted with mouse gamma-adaptin and alpha-adaptin.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis and Western blot analysis, Pohler et
al. (2012) confirmed that p34 interacted with both AP1 and AP2
complexes. Knockdown of p34 did not alter the TNG or plasma membrane
localization of AP1 or AP2, respectively. In HaCaT cells, knockdown of
AAGAB increased EGFR (131550) mRNA levels and EGFR tyrosine
phosphorylation, indicative of active EGFR signaling. Pohler et al.
(2012) concluded that AAGAB may have a role in regulating EGFR turnover,
possibly via ATPase activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 families with type I punctate palmoplantar keratoderma (PPKP1;
148600), Giehl et al. (2012) identified 2 heterozygous nonsense
mutations in the AAGAB gene, R161X (614888.0001) and R124X
(614888.0002), that segregated fully with disease in the respective
families. Immunofluorescence analyses of skin from the palms and soles
of affected individuals revealed that the amount of granular staining in
keratinocytes was lower in the cytoplasm but higher around the nucleus
than in keratinocytes from controls, suggesting clumping of defective
keratin molecules.

In a collection of 18 PPKP1 kindreds from Scotland, Ireland, Japan, and
Tunisia, 11 of which had a family history consistent with autosomal
dominant inheritance, Pohler et al. (2012) identified heterozygous
mutations in the AAGAB gene (see, e.g., 614888.0001 and
614888.0003-614888.0006).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001

AAGAB, ARG161TER

In affected members of 2 Croatian families with type I punctate
palmoplantar keratoderma (PPKP1A; 148600), Giehl et al. (2012)
identified heterozygosity for a 481C-T transition in exon 5 of the AAGAB
gene, resulting in an arg161-to-ter (R161X) substitution. The mutation
was not found in unaffected family members. Genotyping of 21 individuals
from the 2 families revealed a 1.2-Mb common haplotype between markers
SNP15-67469128 and SNP15-68728632, indicating that the affected
individuals inherited the mutation by descent from a common ancestor.
Immunoblot analysis confirmed the predicted truncated size of
approximately 24 kD for R161X and showed a strong band, suggesting that
the protein is stable and not degraded. Allele-specific PCR
amplification yielded only a very small peak for the 481C-T allele.

In a 4-generation Scottish family with PPKP, Pohler et al. (2012)
identified heterozygosity for the R161X mutation, which segregated with
disease in the family and was not found in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes
databases.

In affected members of a German family with type I punctate palmoplantar

heterozygosity for a 370C-T transition in exon 4 of the AAGAB gene,
resulting in an arg124-to-ter (R124X) substitution. The mutation was not
found in unaffected family members. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the
predicted truncated size of approximately 18 kD for R124X but showed
only a faint band, suggesting that the corresponding mRNA is prone to
decay. Allele-specific PCR amplification yielded undetectable results
for the 370C-T allele, indicating loss of the protein.

heterozygosity for a 2-bp deletion (348_349delAG) in the AAGAB gene,

identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (473del) in the AAGAB

606347	TITLE *606347 PROLINE/SERINE/THREONINE PHOSPHATASE-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; PSTPIP1
;;PSTPIP;;
CD2 ANTIGEN-BINDING PROTEIN 1; CD2BP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Spencer et al. (1997) identified mouse Pstpip1 as a binding protein of
the PEST-type protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs, e.g., PTP-PEST;
600079).

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a T-cell cDNA library with the
cytoplasmic tail of CD2 (186990) as bait, followed by probing a T-cell
cDNA library, Li et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding splice variants
of human PSTPIP1, which they called CD2BP1. The full-length 417-amino
acid protein, which is 88% identical to mouse Pstpip1, contains a
coiled-coil region, which is 30% identical to yeast Cdc15, a PEST
region, and a C-terminal SH3 domain. Compared with full-length CD2BP1,
the shorter variant has a 19-amino acid deletion. Northern blot analysis
revealed expression of a 1.9-kb CD2BP1 transcript that was restricted to
hemopoietic tissues and cell lines, with expression upregulated in
activated T cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed expression of a
50-kD protein. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated localization of
CD2BP1 at the interface of the cytosol and the plasma membrane and
colocalization with CD2 after ligand-induced clustering of surface CD2.

GENE FUNCTION

Binding analysis by Li et al. (1998) showed that the CD2BP1 SH3 domain
interacts with proline-rich segments of the CD2 cytoplasmic tail.
Functional analysis indicated a lack of kinase activity, but significant
tyrosine phosphatase activity.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Cong et al. (2000) identified mouse
Pstpip1 as an ABL (189980)-interacting protein. They showed that Pstpip1
was phosphorylated by ABL. Growth factor-induced Pstpip1 phosphorylation
was diminished in ABL null fibroblasts. Pstpip1 was able to bridge ABL
to the PEST-type PTPs. Several experiments suggested that the PEST-type
PTPs negatively regulate ABL activity: ABL was hyperphosphorylated in
PTP-PEST-deficient cells; disruption of the ABL-Pstpip1-PEST-type PTP
ternary complex by overexpression of mutants increased ABL
phosphotyrosine content; and PDGF (see 190040)-induced ABL kinase
activation was prolonged in PTP-PEST-deficient cells. The authors
concluded that dephosphorylation of ABL by PSTPIP1-directed PEST-type
PTPs represents a novel mechanism by which ABL activity is regulated.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Shoham et al. (2003) showed that human
PSTPIP1 and human pyrin (MEFV; 608107) interacted with each other and
colocalized within peripheral blood granulocytes and monocytes. Tyrosine
phosphorylation of PSTPIP1 markedly increased binding to pyrin.
Expression of 2 PSTPIP1 mutations (606347.0001 and 606347.0002)
associated with PAPA syndrome (604416) resulted in increased
PSTPIP1-pyrin binding. Shoham et al. (2003) suggested that sequestration
of pyrin in PAPA syndrome may prevent pyrin's normal immunoregulatory
functions, resulting in an excess of IL1-beta (147720) production, as
found in a patient with PAPA syndrome. The findings elucidated another
pathway involved in regulating inflammation, and linked PAPA syndrome
and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF; 249100) as disorders arising from
defects within the same pathway.

Yu et al. (2007) found that both pyrin and PSTPIP1 formed homotrimers,
and that the pyrin homotrimer was inactive due to masking of its PYD
motif by its B box. PSTPIP1 activated pyrin by binding to its B box and
unmasking the PYD, leading to interaction of the PYD with ASC (PYCARD;
606838), ASC dimerization, and recruitment and activation of caspase-1
(CASP1; 147678), a proinflammatory enzyme. Autoinflammatory PSTPIP1
mutants had higher binding affinities for the pyrin B box than did
wildtype PSTPIP1.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PSTPIP1
gene to 15q24-q25.1 (TMAP D15S1170).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Yeon et al. (2000) localized the genes for PAPA syndrome (604416) and
familial recurrent arthritis to chromosome 15q and suggested that they
are the same disorder. Wise et al. (2002) identified mutations in the
PSTPIP1 gene in 2 reported families with this disorder. E250Q
(606347.0001) or A230T (606347.0002) amino acid substitutions occurred
within a domain highly homologous to yeast cleavage furrow-associated
protein CDC15. PSTPIP1 and its murine ortholog are adaptor proteins
known to interact with PEST-type PTPs such as PTPN12 (600079). Yeast
2-hybrid assays demonstrated severely reduced binding between PTPN12 and
both the E250Q and A230T mutant proteins. Previous evidence supported
the integral role of PSTPIP1 and its interacting proteins in actin
reorganization during cytoskeletal-mediated events. The authors
hypothesized that the disease-causing mutations identified compromise
physiologic signaling necessary for the maintenance of a proper
inflammatory response.

PSTPIP1, GLU250GLN

In a 4-generation family with familial recurrent arthritis, which was
thought to be the same disorder as PAPA syndrome (604416), Wise et al.
(2002) identified a 964G-C transversion in the PSTPIP1 gene, which was
predicted to result in a glu250-to-gln (E250Q) substitution. Yeast
2-hybrid assays demonstrated severely reduced binding between PTPN12 and
the mutant protein.

.0002

In affected sibs with PAPA syndrome (604416), Wise et al. (2002)
identified a 904G-A transition in the PSTPIP1 gene, which was predicted
to result in an ala230-to-thr (A230T) substitution. Yeast 2-hybrid
assays demonstrated severely reduced binding between PTPN12 and the
mutant protein.

612609	TITLE *612609 LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE PROTEIN 2A; LCE2A
;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 9; LEP9
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE2A,
which they called LEP9.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) detected LCE2A expression in
human fetal, arm, penal, and abdominal skin. Much weaker expression was
detected in vulva, but not in tongue or esophagus.

GENE FUNCTION

Jackson et al. (2005) showed that expression of LCE2 genes, including
LCE2A, was upregulated in cultured normal human keratinocytes by both
ultraviolet irradiation and calcium.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that the LCE2A gene contains 2 exons.
Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE2A
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) stated that the mouse Lce2a gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene
cluster on chromosome 3F1.

603050	TITLE *603050 ABL INTERACTOR 1; ABI1
;;SPECTRIN SH3 DOMAIN-BINDING PROTEIN 1; SSH3BP1;;
E3B1
ABI1/MLL FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Taki et al. (1998) identified the ABI1 gene as the fusion partner with
MLL (159555) in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a
t(10;11)(p11.2;q23) ABI1 is a human homolog of mouse Abl-interactor-1
(Abi1). The ABI1 protein exhibited sequence similarity to protein of
homeotic genes, contained several polyproline stretches, and included a
Src homology-3 (SH3) domain at the C terminus that is required for
binding of mouse Abi1 protein to Abl proteins. Three types of the ABI1
gene were expressed in normal peripheral blood. The MLL-ABI1 fusion
transcript in this patient was formed by an alternatively spliced ABI1.
In-frame MLL-ABI1 fusion transcripts combined the MLL AT-hook motifs and
DNA methyltransferase homology region with the homeodomain homologous
region, polyproline stretches, and SH3 domain of the alternatively
spliced transcript of ABI1. The results suggested that ABI1 plays a role
in the leukemogenesis by translocating to MLL.

Taki et al. (1998) noted the similarity between the protein they
described and the E3B1 protein described by Biesova et al. (1997), which
was also isolated as a human homolog of mouse Abi1.

MAPPING

Taki et al. (1998) identified the ABI1 gene on chromosome 10p11.2 as the
fusion partner of MLL in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia.

GENE FUNCTION

Scita et al. (1999) demonstrated that EPS8 (600206) and E3B1/ABI1
participate in the transduction of signals from Ras (190020) to Rac (see
602048) by regulating Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor
(GEF) activities. Scita et al. (1999) also showed that EPS8, E3B1, and
SOS1 (182530) form a tricomplex in vivo that exhibits Rac-specific GEF
activity in vitro. Scita et al. (1999) proposed a model in which EPS8
mediates the transfer of signals between Ras and Rac by forming a
complex with E3B1 and SOS1.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; 131550) signaling involves small
GTPases of the Rho family, and EGFR trafficking involves small GTPases
of the Rab family. Lanzetti et al. (2000) reported that the EPS8 protein
connects these signaling pathways. EPS8 is a substrate of EGFR that is
held in a complex with SOS1 by the adaptor protein E3B1, thereby
mediating activation of RAC. Through its SH3 domain, EPS8 interacts with
RNTRE (605405). Lanzetti et al. (2000) showed that RNTRE is a RAB5
(179512) GTPase-activating protein whose activity is regulated by EGFR.
By entering in a complex with EPS8, RNTRE acts on RAB5 and inhibits
internalization of the EGFR. Furthermore, RNTRE diverts EPS8 from its
RAC-activating function, resulting in the attenuation of RAC signaling.
Thus, depending on its state of association with E3B1 or RNTRE, EPS8
participates in both EGFR signaling through RAC and EGFR trafficking
through RAB5.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Tani et al. (2003) found that human ABI1
bound mouse Mena (ENAH; 609061). Binding analysis revealed that the EVH1
domain of Mena bound a polyproline structure of ABI1. Endogenous MENA
and ABL1 (189980) coprecipitated with epitope-tagged ABI1 from human
embryonic kidney cells. ABI1 dramatically promoted ABL1-mediated
tyrosine phosphorylation of MENA, but not of other substrates. Mutation
analysis demonstrated that Mena was tyrosine phosphorylated on tyr296.

605837	TITLE *605837 HECT DOMAIN AND RCC1-LIKE DOMAIN 2; HERC2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The HERC2 gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that shuttles between the
nucleus and the cytoplasm. It binds to UBE3A (601623) and activates the
ubiquitin ligase activity of that gene (summary by Puffenberger et al.,
2012).

For background information on the HERC gene family, see HERC1 (605109).

CLONING

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS; 176270) and Angelman syndrome (AS; 105830)
result from deletions and loss of function of oppositely imprinted genes
located within the proximal 2 Mb of the 15q11-q13 region. Low-copy
repeat elements have been identified in the vicinity of the 3 deletion
breakpoint hotspots using molecular and cytologic methods. Using
positional cloning from low-copy repeats flanking 15q11-q13, genomic
sequence analysis, EST database searching, PCR, and long-range RT-PCR,
Ji et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA encoding HERC2, which is identical to a
partial cDNA, KIAA0393, identified by Nagase et al. (1997). Sequence
analysis predicted that the 4,834-amino acid protein, which is 95%
identical and 99% similar to the mouse protein, contains 3 RCC1-like
domains (RLDs); a putative ZZ-type zinc finger motif with 6 conserved
cysteines and 2 outlying histidine residues; a C-terminal HECT or E3
ubiquitin ligase (see UBE3A; 601623) domain; and several potential
phosphorylation sites. The overall structure is similar to that of
HERC1, although HERC1 has only 2 RLDs and no zinc finger motif. The
C-terminal region of HERC2 resembles that of HERC3 (605200). Northern
blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of a 15.5-kb HERC2
transcript, with high levels in fetal tissues and adult skeletal muscle,
heart, ovary, testis, and brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Ji et al. (1999) identified splice junction mutations in the Herc2 gene
in chemically-induced jdf2 mutant alleles. The mutations led to exon
skipping and premature termination, resulting in neuromuscular secretory
vesicle defects, sperm acrosome defects, and juvenile lethality in jdf2
mice.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the HERC2 gene, which they called KIAA0393,
to chromosome 15 using radiation hybrid analysis. By Southern blot
analysis of YACs and radiation hybrid analysis, Ji et al. (1999) mapped
the HERC2 gene to 15q11-q13, very close to the P gene (OCA2; 611409).
Southern blot analysis of PWS and AS patients resulted in HERC2 signals
of 50% intensity compared with controls. The mouse Herc2 gene maps to
chromosome 7C, within the juvenile development and fertility-2 (jdf2)
interval (Ji et al., 1999).

Kayser et al. (2008) identified the HERC2 gene within a region on
chromosome 15q13.1 linked to determination of human iris color.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Skin, Hair, Eye Pigmentation

In a large genomewide scan to identify variants associated with hair and
eye pigmentation, skin sensitivity to sun, and freckling, Sulem et al.
(2007) identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), dbSNP
rs1667394, in intron 4 of the HERC2 gene (605837.0001) that was
associated with blue eye color and blond hair. Of several SNPs within a
1-Mb region of linkage overlapping the OCA2 gene (611409), dbSNP
rs1667394 had the strongest association with pigmentation. Given the
established relationship between OCA2 and pigmentation, Sulem et al.
(2007) considered it unlikely that the association signal provided by
this SNP was due to a functional effect on HERC2.

In 3 independent genomewide association studies and a genomewide linkage
study involving over 2,600 persons from the Netherlands, Kayser et al.
(2008) found that the chromosome 15q13.1 region is the predominant
region involved in human iris color. There were no other regions showing
consistent genomewide evidence for association and linkage to iris
color. SNPs in the HERC2 gene and, to a lesser extent, in the
neighboring OCA2 gene (611409) were independently associated with iris
color variation. Kayser et al. (2008) found that HERC2 dbSNP rs916977
(605837.0002) showed a clinal allele distribution across 23 European
populations that was significantly correlated to iris color variation.
They suggested that genetic variants regulating expression of the OCA2
gene exist in the HERC2 gene or, alternatively, with the 11.7 kb of
sequence between OCA2 and HERC2, and that most iris color variation in
Europeans is explained by those 2 genes. They further suggested that
testing markers in the HERC2-OCA2 region may be useful in forensic
applications to predict eye color phenotypes of unknown persons of
European genetic origin.

Duffy et al. (2007) demonstrated that haplotypes of 3 SNPs within the
first intron of the OCA2 gene are strongly associated with variation in
human eye color. Following up on this study, Sturm et al. (2008)
described additional fine association mapping of eye color SNPs in the
intergenic region upstream of OCA2 and within the neighboring HERC2
gene. They screened an additional 92 SNPs in 300 to 3,000 European
individuals and found that a single SNP in intron 86 of HERC2, dbSNP
rs12913832 (605837.0003), predicted eye color significantly better than
their previous best OCA2 haplotype. Comparison of sequence alignments of
multiple species showed that this SNP lies in the center of a short
highly conserved sequence and that the blue eye-associated allele
(frequency 78%) breaks up this conserved sequence, part of which forms a
consensus binding site for the helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF;
603257). Sturm et al. (2008) also demonstrated that the OCA2 coding SNP
R419Q (611409.0012) acts as a penetrance modifier of this new HERC2 SNP
for eye color and, somewhat independently, of melanoma risk. Sturm et
al. (2008) concluded that the conserved region around dbSNP rs12913832
(the SNP in intron 86 of HERC2) represents a regulatory region
controlling constitutive expression of OCA2 and that the C allele at
this SNP leads to decreased expression of OCA2, particularly within iris
melanocytes, which they postulated to be the ultimate cause of blue eye
color.

In a 3-generation Danish family segregating blue and brown eye color,
Eiberg et al. (2008) used fine mapping to identify a 166-kb candidate
region within the HERC2 gene. Further studies of SNPs within this region
among 144 blue-eyed and 45 brown-eyed individuals identified 2 SNPs,
dbSNP rs1129038 and the strongly conserved dbSNP rs12913832, that showed
significant associations with the blue-eyed phenotype (p = 6.2 x
10(-46)). A common founder haplotype containing these SNPs was
identified among blue-eyed persons from Denmark, Turkey, and Jordan. In
vitro functional expression studies in human colon carcinoma cells
showed that what the authors referred to as the 'G' allele of dbSNP
rs12913832, present in blue-eyed individuals, had an inhibitory effect
on OCA2 promoter activity. In the 3-generation Danish family, blond hair
color was associated with lighter brown/blue eyes and brown hair color
was associated with brown eyes. Hair color also associated with several
SNPs in the HERC2 gene. However, linkage analysis also implicated a
region associated with hair color on chromosome 14 (lod score of 4.21 at
D14S72), close to the RABGGTA gene (601905).

Donnelly et al. (2012) genotyped 3,432 individuals from 72 populations
for 21 SNPs in the OCA2-HERC2 region, and found that blue-eye-associated
alleles in all 3 haplotypes that previously had been associated with eye
pigmentation in Europeans occurred at high frequencies in Europe;
however, 1 was restricted to Europe and surrounding regions, whereas the
other 2 were found at moderate to high frequencies throughout the world.
Their data suggested that the TG allele of the haplotype restricted to
Europe, consisting of the SNPs dbSNP rs1129038 and dbSNP rs12913832 and
which they designated 'BEH2,' was the best marker for blue eyes.

- Autosomal Recessive Mental Retardation 38

In 7 patients of Amish or mixed Amish/Mennonite descent with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-38 (MRT38; 615516), Puffenberger et al.
(2012) identified a homozygous missense mutation in the HERC2 gene
(P594L; 605837.0004). The mutation was found by a combination of
homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing. Cellular transfection studies
showed that the mutant protein was less stable than wildtype and had a
diffuse cytosolic localization with the formation of abnormal
aggregates. Decreased abundance and/or activity of HERC2 could produce a
toxic loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, leading to decreased
degradation of ARC (612461) and decreased postsynaptic glutamatergic
AMPA receptor density. Puffenberger et al. (2012) noted that this
pathophysiologic mechanism is similar to that thought to underlie
Angelman syndrome (105830), which results from loss of function of the
UBE3A gene (601623) on chromosome 15q11. The individuals with MRT38 had
some features similar to those of AS.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 1, BLUE/NONBLUE EYES
SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 1, BLOND/BROWN HAIR, INCLUDED
HERC2, IVS4, A/G

In a discovery sample of 2,986 Icelanders and replication samples of
2,718 Icelanders and 1,214 Dutch, Sulem et al. (2007) found association
of the A allele of dbSNP rs1667394 with blue versus brown eyes (OR =
35.42, P = 1.4 x 10(-124)), with blue versus green eyes (OR = 7.02, P =
5.1 x 10(-25)), and with blond versus brown hair (OR = 5.62, P = 4.4 x
10(-16)). Although the dbSNP rs1667394 variant resides in the HERC2
gene, Sulem et al. (2007) considered it unlikely that the association
signal provided by this SNP was due to a functional effect on HERC2.
Because of the established relationship between the OCA2 gene (611409)
and blue eye color and lighter hair and skin tones (227220), the authors
suggested that perhaps sequence variation in the introns of HERC2
affects the expression of OCA2, or that functional variants exist within
OCA2 that correlate with dbSNP rs1667394.

.0002
SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 1, BLUE/NONBLUE EYES
HERC2, IVS12, C/T

In 3 independent genomewide association studies of a total of 1,406
persons and a genomewide linkage study of 1,292 relatives, all from the
Netherlands, Kayser et al. (2008) found that the HERC2 variant dbSNP
rs916977 showed a gradient-wise (clinal) allele distribution across 23
European populations that was significantly correlated to iris color
variation (227220), with the C allele, associated with blue eyes, being
more common in northern Europe and the T allele, associated with brown
eyes, more common in southern Europe. Analysis of dbSNP rs916977
together with the 3 SNPs in intron 1 of the OCA2 gene identified by
Duffy et al. (2007) (611409.0013) revealed significant genomewide
association for only the HERC2 SNP (P = 3.53 x 10(-18)).

.0003
SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 1, BLUE/NONBLUE EYES
HERC2, IVS86, C/T

In a study of the association with eye color (227220) with
haplotype-tagging SNPs proximal to intron 1 of the OCA2 gene (611409)
that span the intergenic region and encompass the 3-prime end of the
upstream gene HERC2, Sturm et al. (2008) identified a SNP in intron 86
of HERC2, dbSNP rs12913832, that was strongly associated with eye color
in 3011 European individuals (P = 2 x 10(-78)). Individuals carrying the
CC genotype had only a 1% probability of having brown eyes, while those
with the TT genotype had an 80% probability. Haplotype analysis
combining the 3 SNPs in OCA2 identified by Duffy et al. (2007)
(611409.0013) with dbSNP rs12913832 followed by multiple ordinal
logistic regression showed that the HERC2 SNP alone was the best
predictor of eye color. Sturm et al. (2008) concluded that the conserved
region around dbSNP rs12913832 represents a regulatory region
controlling constitutive expression of OCA2, and that the C allele of
dbSNP rs12913832 leads to decreased expression of OCA2, particularly
within iris melanocytes, by abrogation of the binding site for HLTF
(603257) that regulates transcription of OCA2. Sturm et al. (2008) also
demonstrated that the OCA2 coding SNP R419Q (611409.0012) acts as a
penetrance modifier of dbSNP rs12913832.

In a 3-generation Danish family segregating blue and brown eye color,
Eiberg et al. (2008) used fine mapping to identify a 166-kb candidate
region within the HERC2 gene. Further studies of SNPs within this region
among 144 blue-eyed and 45 brown-eyed individuals identified 2 SNPs,
dbSNP rs1129038 and the strongly conserved dbSNP rs12913832, that showed
significant associations with the blue-eyed phenotype (p = 6.2 x
10(-46)). A common founder haplotype containing these SNPs was
identified among blue-eyed persons from Denmark, Turkey, and Jordan. In
vitro functional expression studies in human colon carcinoma cells
showed that what the authors referred to as the 'G' allele of dbSNP
rs12913832, present in blue-eyed individuals, had an inhibitory effect
on OCA2 promoter activity.

MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 38
HERC2, PRO594LEU

In 7 patients of Amish or mixed Amish/Mennonite descent with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-38 (MRT38; 615516), Puffenberger et al.
(2012) identified a homozygous c.1781C-T transition in the HERC2 gene,
resulting in a pro594-to-leu (P594L) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in the first RLD1 domain. The mutation was found by a
combination of homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing. The mutation
was not present in the dbSNP database or in 760 alleles from Amish and
Mennonite controls. Cellular transfection studies demonstrated that the
mutant protein was less stable than wildtype and showed diffuse
cytosolic localization with the formation of abnormal aggregates.
Decreased abundance and/or activity of HERC2 could produce a toxic loss
of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, leading to decreased degradation of ARC
(612461) and decreased postsynaptic glutamatergic AMPA receptor density.
Puffenberger et al. (2012) noted that this pathophysiologic mechanism is
similar to that thought to underlie Angelman syndrome (105830), which
results from loss of function of the UBE3A gene (601623) on chromosome
15q11. The affected individuals with the HERC2 mutation had global
developmental delay and autistic features similar to Angelman syndrome;
they also had blue irides.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nagase et al. (1997) cloned a WNK1 cDNA, which they called KIAA0344. The
deduced protein contains 1,246 amino acids. RT-PCR detected highest
expression in kidney.

Using degenerate PCR against conserved kinase catalytic subdomains,
Moore et al. (2000) cloned human WNK1, which they called PSK. PSK
belongs to the STE20 family of serine-threonine kinases. The PSK protein
contains 1,235 amino acids and has an N-terminal kinase domain. PSK was
ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined by Northern blot
analysis, with strongest expression in testis.

Xu et al. (2000) isolated a full-length rat cDNA encoding Wnk1 and
identified homologs in various species, including partial human
sequences. The N-terminal half of the deduced 2,126-amino acid rat
protein has a proline-rich region, followed by a serine/threonine kinase
domain and coiled-coil region, and the C-terminal half has a
proline-rich region and coiled-coil region. Wnk1 contains a cysteine
instead of the usual lysine at a key position in its active site.
Immunoblot analysis detected an endogenous 230-kD protein in rat brain
and several mammalian cell lines, including human embryonic kidney
(HEK293) cells. Most endogenous WNK1 protein was found in the
particulate fraction of HEK293 cells, suggesting that WNK1 is associated
with membranes or the cytoskeleton. Immunofluorescence analysis of
HEK293 cells transfected with rat Wnk1 revealed cytoplasmic staining.

Wilson et al. (2001) noted that the deduced human and rat WNK1 proteins
share 86% identity. By Northern blot analysis, they observed expression
of human WNK1 in most tissues, with 2 predominant isoforms: a 10-kb
transcript expressed at high levels in the kidney, and a 12-kb
transcript predominant in heart and skeletal muscle. By
immunofluorescence microscopy, Wilson et al. (2001) demonstrated that
WNK1 localizes to the distal convoluted tubule and the cortical
collecting duct, and is also abundant in the medullary collecting duct.

Choate et al. (2003) examined the distribution of WNK1 in extrarenal
tissues. Immunostaining using WNK1-specific antibodies demonstrated that
WNK1 was not present in all cell types; rather, it was predominantly
localized in polarized epithelia, including those lining the lumen of
the hepatic biliary ducts, pancreatic ducts, epididymis, sweat ducts,
colonic crypts, and gallbladder. WNK1 was also found in the basal layers
of epidermis and throughout the esophageal epithelium. Subcellular
localization of WNK1 varied among these epithelia. WNK1 was cytoplasmic
in kidney, colon, gallbladder, sweat duct, skin, and esophagus. In
contrast, it localized to the lateral membrane in bile ducts, pancreatic
ducts, and epididymis. These epithelia are all notable for their
prominent role in chloride-iron flux.

Using primer extension with human leukocyte and kidney RNA, 5-prime RACE
of human heart and kidney cDNA libraries, and RT-PCR of human heart,
skeletal muscle, and kidney RNA, Delaloy et al. (2003) characterized
several WNK1 variants resulting from tissue-specific splicing and the
use of multiple transcriptional start sites and polyadenylation sites.
Two promoters in exon 1 generate 2 ubiquitously expressed WNK1 isoforms
with complete kinase domains. A third promoter in exon 4A generates a
kidney-specific transcript that encodes an N-terminally truncated
protein that is kinase defective. Exon 4A is highly conserved between
human and rodents and encodes a cysteine-rich region. Northern blot
analysis detected a 9-kb transcript expressed predominantly in human
kidney and a 10.5-kb transcript expressed predominantly in skeletal
muscle, heart, and brain. Qualitative RT-PCR detected 10 times more
kinase-defective transcript than kinase domain-containing transcript in
human kidney mRNA. In situ hybridization of adult mouse kidney using an
exon 4A-specific probe revealed expression in kidney cortex,
predominantly in distal convoluted tubules.

- WNK1/HSN2 Isoform

Lafreniere et al. (2004) identified a novel gene, which they designated
HSN2, within the hereditary sensory neuropathy type II (HSAN2; 201300)
critical region on 12p13.33. The HSN2 gene encodes a deduced 434-amino
acid protein. Northern blot analysis of adult human tissues failed to
detect HSN2 transcripts, suggesting that the gene might be expressed at
very low levels. Lafreniere et al. (2004) suggested that the HSN2
protein may play a role in the development and/or maintenance of
peripheral sensory neurons or their supporting Schwann cells.

By Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis using mouse Wnk1, Shekarabi et al.
(2008) concluded that HSN2 is an alternatively spliced exon of WNK1 and
is part of a nervous system-specific isoform of WNK1, which they called
WNK1/HSN2. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues showed a 10-kb
transcript exclusively expressed in nervous system tissues, including
the spinal cord, brain, and dorsal root ganglia. RT-PCR analysis
demonstrated that the Wnk1/Hsn2 isoform includes either the Hsn2 exon
alone or Hsn2 along with a novel exon 8B and lacks exons 11 and 12.
Immunohistochemical studies confirmed localization of the Wnk1/Hsn2
isoform to mouse nervous system tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wilson et al. (2001) determined that the WNK1 gene contains 28 exons
that span 156 kb of genomic DNA.

Delaloy et al. (2003) identified 2 promoters in exon 1 of the WNK1 gene,
including 1 within the coding region, that generate ubiquitously
expressed WNK1 transcripts. A third promoter, located in the alternative
exon 4A within intron 4, generates a kidney-specific transcript. The
promoters lack TATA boxes, are GC-rich, and contain several
transcription factor-binding sites. A repressor element is present in
the most 5-prime promoter in exon 1. In addition, WNK1 has multiple
transcription start sites in exon 1 and 2 polyadenylation sites at its
3-prime end.

- WNK1/HSN2 Isoform

Lafreniere et al. (2004) determined that the HSN2 gene consists of a
single exon that is located within intron 8 of the WNK1 gene and
transcribed from the same strand. The authors initially concluded that
the WNK1 and HSN2 genes were differentially regulated. Subsequently,
Shekarabi et al. (2008) determined that HSN2 is a nervous-system
specific exon of the WNK1 gene, and they identified a novel exon 8B.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid panel, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the
WNK1 gene to chromosome 12.

GENE FUNCTION

Moore et al. (2000) found that immunoprecipitated PSK phosphorylated
myelin basic protein (159430) and transfected PSK-stimulated MKK4
(601335) and MKK7 (603014), and activated the c-Jun N-terminal kinase
(JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (see 603014).
Microinjection of PSK into cells resulted in localization of PSK to a
vesicular compartment and caused a marked reduction in actin stress
fibers. In contrast, C-terminally truncated PSK did not localize to this
compartment or induce a decrease in stress fibers, demonstrating a
requirement for the C terminus. Kinase-defective PSK, carrying a
lys57-to-ala (K57A) mutation, was unable to reduce stress fibers.

Xu et al. (2002) expressed fragments of rat Wnk1 in bacteria and
identified an autoinhibitory region just C-terminal to the kinase
domain. The isolated autoinhibitory domain, which is conserved in all 4
human WNKs, suppressed the activity of the Wnk1 kinase domain. Mutation
of 2 conserved phenylalanines in the autoinhibitory domain (phe524 and
phe526 in rat Wnk1) attenuated its ability to inhibit Wnk1 kinase
activity, and the same mutations in a Wnk1 fragment containing the
autoinhibitory domain increased its kinase activity. Wnk1 expressed in
bacteria was autophosphorylated, and autophosphorylation of ser382 in
the activation loop was required for its activity.

Yang et al. (2003) found that mouse Wnk4 (601844) reduced the plasma
membrane association of the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride
cotransporter (NCC, or SLC12A3; 600968) in injected Xenopus oocytes.
They further demonstrated that Wnk1 did not affect Slc12a3-mediated
sodium uptake in oocytes, but coexpression of Wnk1 with both Wnk4 and
Slc12a3 restored sodium uptake to levels observed in oocytes expressing
Slc12a3 alone.

To investigate the mechanisms by which WNK1 and WNK4 interact to
regulate ion transport, Yang et al. (2005) performed experiments in
HEK293 cells and Xenopus oocytes which showed that the WNK4 C terminus
mediates SLC12A3 suppression, that the WNK1 kinase domain interacts with
the WNK4 kinase domain, and that WNK1 inhibition of WNK4 is dependent on
WNK1 catalytic activity and an intact WNK1 protein.

Yang et al. (2007) noted that WNK1, WNK4, and the kidney-specific WNK1
isoform interact to regulate SLC12A3 activity, suggesting that WNKs form
a signaling complex. They found that human WNK3 (300358), which is
expressed by distal tubule cells, interacted with rodent Wnk1 and Wnk4
to regulate SLC12A3 in cultured kidney cells and Xenopus oocytes.
Regulation of SLC12A3 in oocytes resulted from antagonism between WNK3
and Wnk4.

Lee et al. (2004) found that rat Wnk1 selectively bound to and
phosphorylated synaptotagmin-2 (SYT2; 600104) calcium-binding C2
domains. Endogenous Wnk1 and Syt2 coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized
on a subset of secretory granules in a rat insulinoma cell line.
Phosphorylation by Wnk1 increased the amount of Ca(2+) required for Syt2
binding to phospholipid vesicles. Lee et al. (2004) concluded that
phosphorylation of SYT2 by WNK1 can regulate Ca(2+) sensing and the
subsequent Ca(2+)-dependent interactions mediated by synaptotagmin C2
domains.

Lenertz et al. (2005) found that hypertonic stress activated rat Wnk1
when it was expressed in kidney epithelial cells and breast and colon
cancer cell lines. Hypotonic stress led to a modest increase in Wnk1
activity. Gel filtration suggested that Wnk1 exists as a tetramer, and
yeast 2-hybrid analysis revealed interaction between residues 1 to 222
of the Wnk1 N terminus and Wnk1 residues 481 to 660, which contain the
autoinhibitory domain and a coiled-coil region. Lenertz et al. (2005)
found no direct interaction between Wnk1 and Wnk4, but Wnk1
phosphorylated both Wnk2 (606249) and Wnk4, and the Wnk1 autoinhibitory
domain inhibited the catalytic activities of Wnk2 and Wnk4.

Using Xenopus oocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells, Xu et al. (2005)
showed that WNK1 controls ion permeability by activating SGK1 (602958),
leading to activation of the epithelial sodium channel (see SCNN1A;
600228). Increased WNK1-induced channel activity depended on SGK1 and
the E3 ubiquitin ligase, NEDD4-2 (NEDD4L; 606384).

Alternative splicing of WNK1 produces a kidney-specific short form that
lacks a kinase domain, KS-WNK1, and a more ubiquitous long form, L-WNK1.
Using reconstitution studies in Xenopus oocytes, Wade et al. (2006)
found that rat L-Wnk1 inhibited the K+ channel Kir1.1 (KCNJ1; 600359) by
reducing its cell surface localization, and this inhibition required an
intact kinase domain. Ks-Wnk1 did not directly alter Kir1.1 channel
activity, but it acted as a dominant-negative inhibitor of L-Wnk1 and
released Kir1.1 from inhibition. Acute dietary potassium loading in rats
increased the relative abundance of Ks-Wnk1 to L-Wnk1 transcript and
protein in kidney, indicating that physiologic upregulation of Kir1.1
activity involves a WNK1 isoform switch.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of Jurkat human T cells and
immunoprecipitation analysis of human embryonic kidney cells and HeLa
cells, Anselmo et al. (2006) showed that OSR1 (OXSR1; 604046) and WNK1
interacted through conserved C-terminal motifs. OSR1 was phosphorylated
in a WNK1-dependent manner, and depletion of WNK1 from HeLa cells with
small interfering RNA reduced OSR1 kinase activity. Depletion of either
WNK1 or OSR1 reduced Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC; see 600839) activity,
suggesting that WNK1 and OSR1 are required for NKCC function.

He et al. (2007) showed that mammalian Wnk1 and Wnk4 interacted with the
endocytic scaffold protein intersectin-1 (ITSN1; 602442) and that these
interactions were crucial for stimulation of Romk1 (KCNJ1) endocytosis.
Stimulation of Romk1 endocytosis by Wnk1 and Wnk4 required their
proline-rich motifs, but it did not require their kinase activities.
Pseudohypoaldosteronism II (145260)-causing mutations in Wnk4 enhanced
the interactions of Wnk4 with Itsn1 and Romk1, leading to increased
endocytosis of Romk1.

Yang et al. (2007) showed that coexpression of rodent Wnk1 and Wnk4 with
human CFTR (602421) suppressed CFTR-dependent chloride channel activity
in Xenopus oocytes. The effect of Wnk4 was dose dependent, independent
of Wnk4 kinase activity, and occurred, at least in part, by reducing
CFTR protein abundance at the plasma membrane. In contrast, the effect
of Wnk1 on CFTR activity required Wnk1 kinase activity. Moreover, Wnk1
and Wnk4 exhibited additive CFTR inhibition.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Pseudohypoaldosteronism Type IIC

Wilson et al. (2001) identified WNK1 as the gene mutant in one form of
pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHA2C; 614492), an autosomal dominant
disorder characterized by hypertension, hyperkalemia, and renal tubular
acidosis. In a 10-member kindred segregating PHAII, they identified a
41-kb deletion in intron 1 of WNK1 (605232.0001). In the family
previously described by Disse-Nicodeme et al. (2000), they identified a
22-kb deletion within intron 1 of WNK1 (605232.0002). Wilson et al.
(2001) found that affected individuals carrying the 22-kb deletion had a
5-fold increase in the level of WNK1 transcripts in leukocytes relative
to those of their unaffected relatives, thus demonstrating that the
deletion alters WNK1 expression.

- Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy II

Among from 5 families with HSAN2, including 2 from Newfoundland, 2 from
rural Quebec, and 2 from Nova Scotia, Lafreniere et al. (2004)
identified 3 different truncating mutations in the WNK1 gene (594delA,
605232.0003; 918insA, 605232.0004; Q315X, 605232.0005).

Roddier et al. (2005) identified 2 founder mutations in the WNK1 gene
(918insA and Q315X) that were responsible for HSAN2 in the southern part
of Quebec.

Coen et al. (2006) reported 3 unrelated patients with HSAN2 from Italy,
Austria, and Belgium, respectively. All had compound heterozygous or
homozygous truncating mutations in the WNK1 gene, resulting in complete
loss of protein function. All patients had early onset of a severe
sensory neuropathy with mutilating acropathy but without autonomic
dysfunction. Muscle strength was preserved.

- Hypokalemic Salt-Losing Renal Tubulopathy

Zhang et al. (2013) studied 44 Chinese patients with hypokalemia of
unknown cause, metabolic alkalosis, and normal to low blood pressure. In
33 patients, they identified homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for
known mutations in the CLCNKB (602023) or SLC12A3 (600968) genes,
associated with forms of Bartter syndrome (see 607364) and Gitelman
syndrome (263800), respectively. Of the 11 remaining patients, 8 were
heterozygous for a mutation in the SLC12A3 gene, whereas in 3, no
mutation was detected in either gene. Screening for mutations in the
candidate genes WNK1 and WNK4 (601844) revealed heterozygosity for 2
missense mutations in WNK1 (605232.0012 and 605232.0013, respectively)
in 2 of the 11 patients, both of whom were also heterozygous for a known
mutation in SLC12A3, each of which had previously been reported in a
patient diagnosed with Gitelman syndrome (Simon et al., 1996 and Shao et
al., 2008, respectively). No mutations were detected in WNK4. Zhang et
al. (2013) suggested that inactivating mutations in WNK1 may cause
salt-losing renal tubulopathy, which represents a phenotype that is the
converse of PHAII, caused by WNK1 gain-of-function mutations.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

In a girl with HSAN2, Shekarabi et al. (2008) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the WNK1 gene: 1 in the WNK1/HSN2
isoform (605232.0010) and 1 in the WNK1 isoform (605232.0011). She did
not have hypertension. The authors noted that all recessive mutations
associated with the HSAN2 phenotype resulted in truncations of the
WNK1/HSN2 nervous system-specific protein. Disease-causing mutations in
WNK1 resulting in PHA2C were large, heterozygous intronic deletions that
increase the gene expression. This impact on the expression level in
PHA2C patients may explain the absence of hypertension in individuals
affected with HSAN2, as the expression of the WNK1 isoform in which the
HSN2 exon is not incorporated should not be affected. The findings in
their patient suggested that 1 mutation in the HSN2 exon is sufficient
to cause the HSAN2 phenotype when combined with a mutation in WNK1 on
the other allele. Moreover, homozygous mutations disrupting WNK1
isoforms without HSN2 may be lethal, which would explain why all
loss-of-function mutations reported to date have been located in the
HSN2 exon.

ANIMAL MODEL

To accelerate the genetic determination of gene function, Zambrowicz et
al. (2003) developed a sequence-tagged gene-trap library of more than
270,000 mouse embryonic stem cell clones representing mutations in
approximately 60% of mammalian genes. Through the generation and
phenotypic analysis of knockout mice from this resource, they undertook
a functional screen to identify genes regulating physiologic parameters
such as blood pressure. As part of this screen, mice deficient for the
Wnk1 gene were generated and analyzed. Genetic studies in humans had
shown that large intronic deletions in WNK1 lead to its overexpression
and are responsible for pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (Wilson et al.,
2001), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hypertension,
increased renal salt reabsorption, and impaired potassium and hydrogen
excretion. Consistent with the human genetic studies, Wnk1 heterozygous
mice displayed a significant decrease in blood pressure. Mice homozygous
for the Wnk1 mutation died during embryonic development before day 13 of
gestation. Zambrowicz et al. (2003) concluded that WNK1 is a regulator
of blood pressure critical for development and illustrated the utility
of a functional screen driven by a sequence-based mutagenesis approach.

WNK1, 41-KB DEL, IVS1

In a family with pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHA2C; 614492), Wilson

In a family with pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHA2C; 614492)
reported by Disse-Nicodeme et al. (2000), Wilson et al. (2001)

WNK1, 1-BP DEL, 594A

In affected members of 2 Newfoundland families with hereditary sensory
neuropathy type II (201300), 1 of which was consanguineous, Lafreniere
et al. (2004) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion in the HSN2 exon of
the WNK1 gene, 594delA, resulting in a frameshift at codon 198 with a
premature termination and a truncated 206-amino acid peptide. Numbering
of this mutation is based on the HSN exon ORF only.

.0004

WNK1, 1-BP INS, 918A

In 2 sisters from Nova Scotia, born to consanguineous parents, with
hereditary sensory neuropathy type II (201300), Lafreniere et al. (2004)
found homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion in the HSN2 exon of the WNK1
gene, 918insA, resulting in a frameshift at codon 307 with a premature
termination and a truncated 318-amino acid peptide. In 2 French Canadian
sisters with HSAN2, the 918insA mutation was in compound heterozygous
state with the Q315X mutation (605232.0005). Numbering of this mutation
is based on the HSN exon ORF only.

Roddier et al. (2005) identified the 918insA mutation in 7 (58%) of 12
HSAN2 patients from the Lanaudiere region of southern Quebec, suggesting
a founder effect. One patient was homozygous, and 6 were compound
heterozygous with the Q315X mutation. Regional carrier frequency of the
918insA mutation was estimated to range from 1 in 260 to 1 in 28.

.0005
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE II
WNK1, GLN315TER

In a French Canadian patient with hereditary sensory neuropathy type II
(201300), Lafreniere et al. (2004) found homozygosity for a 943C-T
transition in the HSN2 exon of the WNK1 gene, resulting in a
gln315-to-ter substitution (Q315X) predicted to truncate the protein to
314 amino acids. In 2 French Canadian sisters with HSAN2, the Q315X
mutation was found in compound heterozygous state with the 918insA
mutation (605343.0004) in the HSN2 exon. Numbering of this mutation is
based on the HSN exon ORF only.

In affected members of families with HSAN2 (201300) from the the
southern part of Quebec, Roddier et al. (2005) identified the Q315X
mutation. Nine (56%) of 16 patients were homozygous for the mutation,
and 6 (38%) of 16 patients were compound heterozygous with the 918insA
mutation. Most of the patients were from the Lanaudiere region. Regional
carrier frequency of the Q315X mutation was estimated to range from 1 in
116 to 1 in 18.

WNK1, 1-BP DEL, 947C

In 4 affected members of a large consanguineous Lebanese family with
hereditary sensory neuropathy type II (201300), Riviere et al. (2004)
identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (947delC) in the HSN2 exon of the
WNK1 gene, resulting in the loss of 117 amino acids from the protein.
Numbering of this mutation is based on the HSN exon ORF only.

.0007
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE II
WNK1, ARG290TER

In a 13-year-old Canadian child of Lebanese origin with HSAN2 (201300),
Roddier et al. (2005) identified a homozygous 868C-T transition in the
HSN2 exon of the WNK1 gene, resulting in an arg290-to-ter (R290X)
substitution. The authors noted that this mutation differed from that
reported in another Lebanese family (605232.0006).

.0008
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE II
WNK1, 1-BP INS, 1134T

In a 28-year-old Korean man with HSAN2 (201300), Cho et al. (2006)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the HSN2 exon of
the WNK1 gene: a 1-bp insertion (1134insT) and a 217C-T transition,
resulting in a gln73-to-ter (Q73X; 605232.0009) substitution. The
patient had childhood onset of the disorder and amputation of both lower
limbs and several fingers due to ulceration and infection. The patient's
unaffected mother was heterozygous for the 1-bp insertion, and 3
unaffected sibs were heterozygous for the Q73X mutation. The father was
deceased. Numbering of this mutation is based on the HSN exon ORF only.

Takagi et al. (2006) identified homozygosity for the 1134insT mutation
in a Japanese patient with HSAN2, born of consanguineous parents. The
insertion results in frameshift and premature termination of the protein
at residue 378. The patient noted that he felt no pain in his
extremities during his teenage years. He had recurrent skin ulcers on
his fingers and toes resulting in spontaneous or surgical amputation of
several digit tips. Physical examination at age 39 years showed no
autonomic involvement.

WNK1, 1-BP DEL, 639A

In an 18-year-old French girl with HSAN2 (201300), Shekarabi et al.
(2008) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (639delA) in the HSN2
exon of the WNK1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination. Numbering of this mutation is based on the HSN exon ORF
only. Her unaffected father and brother also carried the heterozygous
mutation. Screening of the rest of the WNK1/HSN2 isoform did not reveal
any mutations. However, subsequent screening of the girl in other exons
in the WNK1 gene revealed a heterozygous 2-bp deletion (1584_1585delAG;
605232.0011) in exon 6 of the WNK1 gene, which resulted in frameshift at
codon 531 and premature termination at codon 547 (asp531fsX547). This
mutation was inherited from the unaffected mother. Neither the girl nor
the mother showed signs of hypertension. The findings prompted Shekarabi
et al. (2008) to concluded that HSN2 is an alternative exon within WNK1,
rather than an independent gene.

VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
WNK1, ILE1172MET

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to hypokalemic salt-losing renal tubulopathy (see
241150) has not been confirmed due to the presence of an additional
heterozygous mutation in the SLC12A3 gene (600968).

In a Chinese patient who presented at 10 years of age with fatigue,
numbness, enuresis, and nocturia and was found to have hypokalemia,
metabolic alkalosis, and low to normal blood pressure and to be
heterozygous for a known splice site mutation (7426del13ins12; Shao et
al., 2008) in the SLC12A3 gene, Zhang et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for an A-G transition in exon 16 of the WNK1 gene,
resulting in an ile1172-to-met (I1172M) substitution at an
evolutionarily conserved residue within a coiled-coil domain in the C
terminus. The I1172M mutation arose de novo, as neither parent carried
the WNK1 variant, and it was not found in 400 control alleles or
reported in dbSNP or HGMD databases. However, his unaffected mother was
heterozygous for the SLC12A3 indel splice site mutation. Functional
analysis in HEK293 cells using the corresponding rat WNK1 mutation,
I918M, showed reduced SLC12A3 protein membrane expression in vitro when
cotransfected with WNK4, due to complete abolishment of the suppressive
effect of WNK4-mediated inhibition.

.0013
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
WNK1, SER2047ASN

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to hypokalemic salt-losing renal tubulopathy (see
241150) has not been confirmed due to the presence of an additional
heterozygous mutation in the SLC12A3 gene (600968).

In a Chinese man who presented at age 26 years with fatigue and
hypotonia and was found to have hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and
low to normal blood pressure and to be heterozygous for a known missense
mutation (D486N; Simon et al., 1996) in the SLC12A3 gene, Zhang et al.
(2013) identified heterozygosity for a G-A transition in exon 24 of the
WNK1 gene, resulting in a ser2047-to-asn (S2047N) substitution at a
highly conserved residue within a coiled-coil domain in the C terminus.
The S2047N WNK1 mutation was inherited from his father, who also
displayed hypokalemia, alkalosis, and hypotension; the WNK1 variant was
not found in 400 control alleles or reported in dbSNP or HGMD databases.
The affected father and the patient's asymptomatic 2-year-old daughter
also carried the SLC12A3 mutation, which was not found in other
asymptomatic family members.

601974	TITLE *601974 SPHINGOSINE 1-PHOSPHATE RECEPTOR 1; S1PR1
;;ENDOTHELIAL DIFFERENTIATION GENE 1;;
EDG1 S1P RECEPTOR 1; S1P1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The S1PR1 gene encodes a receptor for the lysosphingolipid sphingosine
1-phosphate (S1P). There are 5 known S1P receptors with distinct but
overlapping regulatory functions in normal physiology and disease
processes, particularly involving the immune, central nervous, and
cardiovascular systems. S1P1 is expressed on lymphocytes, in various
cells of the central nervous system, and in cardiomyocytes, vascular
smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells of cardiac vessels (summary
by Hla and Brinkmann, 2011).

NOMENCLATURE

S1P and the structurally related lysolipid mediator lysophosphatidic
acid (LPA) signal cells through a set of G protein-coupled receptors.
Chun et al. (2002) proposed a nomenclature scheme for the LPA and S1P
receptors that is consistent with the International Union of
Pharmacology (IUP) guidelines. According to these guidelines, a receptor
is to be named with the abbreviation of the natural agonist with the
highest potency, followed by a subscripted arabic number. Thus they
suggested that the designation EDG1 should be changed to S1P1.

CLONING

The tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) inhibits the
growth of human endothelial cells and induces differentiation into
capillary-like, tubular structures. Hla and Maciag (1990) cloned and
sequenced a gene from human umbilical vein endothelial cells which they
designated EDG1 for 'endothelial differentiation gene-1.' The 3-kb EDG1
transcript is rapidly induced when endothelial cells are treated with
PMA and superinduced in the presence of cycloheximide. The deduced
380-amino acid protein contains 7 putative transmembrane domains, making
it structurally similar to G protein-coupled receptors. Since GPRs are
involved in diverse biologic processes such as signal transduction, cell
proliferation, and differentiation, Hla and Maciag (1990) considered the
characterization of human EDG1 as a highly inducible and abundant
endothelial cell GPR to suggest that it may be involved in the processes
that regulate the differentiation of endothelial cells.

By RT-PCR, Liu and Hla (1997) detected significant expression of EDG1 in
brain, lung, heart, spleen, placenta, muscle, liver, uterus, and kidney,
with extremely low levels in testis and thymus. Northern blot analysis
of mouse tissues showed highest expression of Edg1 in brain, spleen, and
heart. In situ hybridization of embryonic mice revealed abundant
expression of Edg1 in skeletal structures undergoing ossification, such
as the vertebral column, basioccipital, basisphenoid, mandibular, and
maxillary bones. Abundant expression was also localized in liver, lung,
and the pulmonary trunk. In adult mouse brain, significant expression
occurred throughout the cerebellum, with localized abundant expression
in the Purkinje cell layer. In the hippocampal region in newborn mouse,
the polymorphic cell layer and dentate gyrus expressed Edg1 in a
localized fashion.

GENE FUNCTION

Sphingosine-1-phosphate is generated intracellularly from sphingomyelin
in a wide variety of cells. It is then moved from the intracellular to
the extracellular space, where it circulates for delivery to cell
surface receptors. S1PR1 is expressed on lymphocytes, in cells of the
central nervous system, and in cardiomyocytes, vascular smooth muscle
cells, and endothelial cells of cardiac vessels. The activation of S1PR1
on lymphocytes promotes egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes (review
by Hla and Brinkmann, 2011).

Lee et al. (1998) demonstrated that S1P activates the heterotrimeric
orphan receptor EDG1. EDG1 bound S1P with high affinity and high
specificity. Overexpression of EDG1 induced exaggerated cell-cell
aggregation and enhanced expression of cadherins and formation of
well-developed adherens junctions in a manner dependent on S1P and the
small guanine nucleotide-binding protein Rho.

EDG1 is a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled
receptor for sphingosine-1-phosphate. Hobson et al. (2001) demonstrated
that cell migration toward platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF;
190040), which stimulates sphingosine kinase and increases intracellular
SPP, was dependent on expression of EDG1. Deletion of EDG1 or inhibition
of sphingosine kinase suppressed chemotaxis toward PDGF and also
activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase RAC (602048), which is
essential for protrusion of lamellipodia and forward movement. Moreover,
PDGF activated EDG1, as measured by translocation of beta-arrestin
(107940) and phosphorylation of EDG1. Hobson et al. (2001) concluded
that their results reveal a role for receptor cross-communication in
which activation of a G protein-coupled receptor by a receptor tyrosine
kinase is critical for cell motility.

The immunosuppressive drug FTY720 is derived from ISP-1 (myriocin), a
fungal metabolite that is an eternal youth nostrum in traditional
Chinese herbal medicine. Brinkmann et al. (2002) showed that FTY720
binds and activates the S1P receptors EDG1, EDG3 (601965), EDG6
(603751), and EDG8 (605146), but not EDG5.

Ishii et al. (2009) reported that S1P, a lipid mediator enriched in
blood, induces chemotaxis and regulates the migration of osteoclast
precursors not only in culture but also in vivo, contributing to the
dynamic control of bone mineral homeostasis. Cells with the properties
of osteoclast precursors express functional S1P receptors (SIPR1 and
S1PR2, 605111) and exhibit positive chemotaxis along an S1P gradient in
vitro. Intravital 2-photon imaging of bone tissues showed that a potent
S1P agonist stimulated motility of osteoclast precursor-containing
monocytoid populations in vivo. Osteoclast/monocyte lineage-specific
conditional S1P knockout mice showed osteoporotic changes due to
increased osteoclast attachment to the bone surface. Furthermore,
treatment with the S1P agonist FTY720 relieved ovariectomy-induced
osteoporosis in mice by reducing the number of mature osteoclasts
attached to the bone surface. Ishii et al. (2009) concluded that their
data provided evidence that S1P controls the migratory behavior of
osteoclast precursors, dynamically regulating bone mineral homeostasis.

Zachariah and Cyster (2010) showed that transgenic expression of S1P1 in
immature thymocytes leads to their perivascular accumulation and
premature release into circulation. Using an intravascular procedure to
label emigrating cells, they found that mature thymocytes exit via blood
vessels at the corticomedullary junction. By deleting sphingosine
kinases SPHK1 (603730) and SPHK2 (607092) in neural crest-derived
pericytes, Zachariah and Cyster (2010) provided evidence that these
specialized vessel-ensheathing cells contribute to the S1P that promotes
thymic egress. Lymphatic endothelial cell-derived S1P was not required.
These studies identified the major thymic egress route and suggested a
role for pericytes in promoting reverse transmigration of cells across
blood vessel endothelium.

Hla and Brinkmann (2011) and Soliven et al. (2011) provided reviews of
the neurobiology of S1P signaling in the CNS via the S1P receptors
(S1PRs) and discussed the benefit of the S1PR modulator, fingolimod
(FTY720), in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS; 126200). FTY720
was approved in 2010 as the first oral treatment for relapsing MS in the
U.S. One effect of FTY720 is to downmodulate S1PR1 to retain circulating
naive and central memory T and B lymphocytes in lymph nodes, while
sparing effector memory T cells. The result is to reduce the
infiltration of autoreactive lymphocytes into the CNS, causing a slowing
of the disease process (Hla and Brinkmann, 2011). In addition, S1PR1 is
expressed in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, neurons, and microglia, where
it may modulate cell survival, process dynamics, migration,
differentiation, activation, and crosstalk. The presence of S1PRs on
multiple cell lines in the CNS may represent a mechanism by which FTY720
may contribute to observed neurologic benefit in patients with MS via
neuroprotective and regenerative effects (Soliven et al., 2011).

Lymphocytes egress from lymphoid organs in response to S1P; minutes
later they migrate from blood into tissue against the S1P gradient.
Arnon et al. (2011) showed that heterotrimeric guanine
nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2; 109635)
functions in downregulation of S1PR1 on blood-exposed lymphocytes. T-
and B-cell movement from blood into lymph nodes was reduced in the
absence of GRK2 but was restored in S1P-deficient mice. In the spleen,
B-cell movement between the blood-rich marginal zone and follicles was
disrupted by GRK2 deficiency and by mutation of an S1PR1 desensitization
motif. Moreover, Arnon et al. (2011) found that delivery of systemic
antigen into follicles was impaired. Thus, GRK2-dependent S1PR1
desensitization allows lymphocytes to escape circulatory fluids and
migrate into lymphoid tissues.

Arnon et al. (2013) developed a 2-photon microscopy procedure to study
marginal zone and follicular B-cell movement in the live mouse spleen
and showed that marginal zone B cells are highly motile and exhibit long
membrane extensions. Marginal zone B cells shuttle between the marginal
zone and follicles with at least one-fifth of the cells exchanging
between compartments per hour, a behavior that explains their ability to
deliver antigens rapidly from the open blood circulation to the secluded
follicles. Follicular B cells also transit from follicles to the
marginal zone, but unlike marginal zone B cells, they fail to undergo
integrin-mediated adhesion, become caught in fluid flow, and are carried
into the red pulp. Follicular B-cell egress via the marginal zone is
S1PR1-dependent. Arnon et al. (2013) concluded that their study showed
that marginal zone B cells migrate continually between marginal zone and
follicles, and established the marginal zone as a site of
S1PR1-dependent B-cell exit from follicles. Arnon et al. (2013)
suggested that their results also showed how adhesive differences of
similar cells critically influence their behavior in the same
microenvironment.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Lee et al. (2001) showed that S1P-induced endothelial cell migration
requires the AKT (164730)-mediated phosphorylation of EDG1. Activated
AKT binds to EDG1 and phosphorylates the third intracellular loop at the
thr236 residue. Transactivation of EDG1 by AKT is not required for
Gi-dependent signaling but is indispensable for RAC activation, cortical
actin assembly, and chemotaxis. Indeed, a thr236-to-ala EDG1 mutant
sequestered AKT and acted as a dominant-negative GPCR to inhibit
S1P-induced RAC activation, chemotaxis, and angiogenesis.
Transactivation of GPCRs by AKT may constitute a specificity switch to
integrate rapid G protein-dependent signals into long-term cellular
phenomena such as cell migration.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using Edg1-null mice, Liu et al. (2000) demonstrated that S1P signaling
through Edg1 is essential for blood vessel formation. Edg1-null mice
exhibited embryonic hemorrhage leading to intrauterine death between
embryonic days 12.5 and 14.5. Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis appeared
normal in the mutant embryos. However, vascular maturation was
incomplete due to a deficiency of vascular smooth muscle
cells/pericytes. The defect was not a generalized defect in smooth
muscle, as the muscular layers of the gastrointestinal tract and the
bronchial tree were well developed. Using wildtype and Edge1-null
fibroblasts in culture, the authors showed that Edg1 mediated an
S1P-induced migration response that was defective in mutant cells.
Mutant cells were also unable to activate Rac in response to S1P
stimulation.

Matloubian et al. (2004) generated fetal liver chimeras by transplanting
lethally irradiated wild-type mice with day 12.5 fetal liver cells from
S1p1 (Edg1) knockout donors, and found that, compared to mice
reconstituted with Edg1+/+ cells, the Edg1 -/- chimeras had an almost
complete absence of CD4- and CD8-positive T cells and reduced numbers of
B lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymphoid organs. In contrast, the
thymus contained normal numbers of immature CD4 and CD8 double-positive
thymocytes but increased numbers of single-positive CD4 and CD8 cells
expressing L-selectin (SELL; 153240), as also seen in animals treated
with FTY720, which inhibits emigration of cells from the thymus.
Matloubian et al. (2004) showed that FTY720 treatment downregulates
S1P1, creating a temporary pharmacologic S1P1-null state in lymphocytes
and inducing lymphocyte sequestration. They concluded that S1P1 is
essential for lymphocyte recirculation and regulates egress from both
thymus and peripheral lymphoid organs.

Using S1p1-deficient mice, Cinamon et al. (2004) showed that S1p1, but
not S1p3, was required for B cell localization to the marginal zone. In
the absence of Cxcl13 (605149), marginal zone B cells from S1p1 -/- mice
reacquired a marginal zone distribution. On exposure to
lipopolysaccharide, marginal zone B cells downregulated S1p1 and S1p3
and migrated to splenic white pulp. Cinamon et al. (2004) concluded that
marginal zone B cell localization depends on responsiveness to the blood
lysophospholipid S1P and that S1P1 signaling overcomes the recruiting
activity of CXCL13.

Lymphocytes require S1P1 to exit lymphoid organs. By using mice in which
the 2 kinases that generate S1P, SPHK1 (603730) and SPHK2 (607092), were
conditionally ablated, Pappu et al. (2007) found that plasma S1P is
mainly hematopoietic in origin, with erythrocytes as a major
contributor, whereas lymph S1P is from a distinct radiation-resistant
source. Lymphocyte egress from thymus and secondary lymphoid organs was
markedly reduced in kinase-deficient mice. Restoration of S1P to plasma
rescued egress to blood but not lymph, and the rescue required
lymphocyte expression of S1P1. Thus, Pappu et al. (2007) concluded that
separate sources provide S1P to plasma and lymph to help lymphocytes
exit the low-S1P environment of lymphoid organs. Pappu et al. (2007)
proposed that disruption of compartmentalized S1P signaling is a
plausible mechanism by which S1P1 agonists function as
immunosuppressives.

Camerer et al. (2009) found that mice selectively lacking S1P in plasma
(Pappu et al., 2007) exhibited increased vascular leak and impaired
survival after anaphylaxis, administration of platelet activating factor
(PAF; see 173393) or histamine, or exposure to related inflammatory
challenges. Increased leak was associated with increased
interendothelial cell gaps in venules and could be reversed by
transfusion with wildtype erythrocytes, which restored plasma S1P
levels, or by acute treatment with an S1pr1 agonist. S1pr1 agonist did
not protect wildtype mice from PAF-induced leak. However, an agonist for
Par2 (F2RL1; 600933) protected wildtype mice from PAF-induced leak, and
this protection was lost after systemic treatment with pertussis toxin.
Camerer et al. (2009) suggested that blood communicates with blood
vessels via plasma S1P to maintain vascular integrity.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using positional cloning methods, Wang et al. (1996) identified a gene,
which they called KVLQT1, within the critical region for long QT
syndrome-1 locus (LQT1; 192500) on chromosome 11. They also determined
that mutations in this gene are responsible for the disorder. KVLQT1 is
strongly expressed in the heart and encodes a protein with structural
features of a voltage-gated potassium channel. The longest open reading
frame of the KVLQT1 cDNA spans 1,645 bp.

Sanguinetti et al. (1996) identified an apparently full-length human
cDNA clone for KVLQT1. This clone predicted a 581-amino acid protein. By
Northern blot analysis they detected a single 3.2-kb mRNA in human
pancreas, heart, kidney, lung, and placenta. No message was detected in
brain, liver, or skeletal muscle.

Yang et al. (1997) described the cloning of a full-length KVLQT1 cDNA
encoding a 676-amino acid polypeptide with structural characteristics
similar to voltage-gated potassium channels.

Barhanin et al. (1996) cloned a full-length KVLQT1 cDNA from a mouse
heart library. Its sequence revealed an open reading frame encoding a
604-amino acid polypeptide sharing 90.5% identity with a human KVLQT1
partial sequence. Hydrophobicity analysis predicted a classic
voltage-dependent potassium channel topology with 6 transmembrane
segments (of the Shaker type) and a long unique C-terminal cytoplasmic
domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Splawski et al. (1998) found that the
KCNQ1 gene contains 16 exons and spans 400 kb. The exon sizes range from
47 to 1,122 bp. Neyroud et al. (1999) comprehensively detailed the
genomic structure of KCNQ1. They determined that the gene contains 19
exons and spans more than 400 kb on chromosome 11p15.5. The authors
presented the sequences of exon-intron boundaries and of oligonucleotide
primers designed to allow PCR amplification of all exons from genomic
DNA.

MAPPING

By positional cloning methods, Wang et al. (1996) identified the KVLQT1
gene within the critical region for long QT syndrome on chromosome
11p15. Sanguinetti et al. (1996) showed that a fragment of the KVLQT1
cDNA mapped to the short arm of chromosome 11.

GENE FUNCTION

To define the function of the KVLQT1 gene, Sanguinetti et al. (1996)
transfected KVLQT1 cDNA into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The
biophysical properties of the transfected KVLQT1 cDNA clone were unlike
those of other known cardiac potassium channels. Through cotransfection
studies, they demonstrated that KVLQT1 and ISK (KCNE1; 176261)
coassemble to form the cardiac I(Ks) channel. They noted that 2
delayed-rectifier potassium channels, I(Kr) and I(Ks), modulate action
potential duration in cardiac myocytes and that dysfunction of both of
the channels contributes to the risk of sudden death from cardiac
arrhythmia.

Barhanin et al. (1996) expressed KVLQT1 in COS cells and carried out
electrophysiologic studies. They demonstrated that KVLQT1 encodes a
subunit forming the cardiac ion channel underlying the I(Ks) cardiac
current. They observed, however, that an additional subunit, ISK, was
required to form the I(Ks) channel. Barhanin et al. (1996) noted that
the I(Kr) and the I(Ks) currents are the targets of antiarrhythmic drugs
and have an important impact in controlling the ventricular
repolarization process. They postulated that the molecular
identification of the I(Ks) channel should help with the design of new
antiarrhythmic drugs.

Expression of KVLQT1 in Xenopus oocytes and human embryonic kidney cells
by Yang et al. (1997) elicited a rapidly activating, K(+)-selective
outward current. They found that clofilium, a class III antiarrhythmic
agent with the propensity to induce torsade de pointes, substantially
inhibited the current. Elevation of cAMP levels in oocytes nearly
doubled the amplitude of KVLQT1 currents.

Marx et al. (2002) demonstrated that beta-adrenergic receptor modulation
of the slow outward potassium ion current (I-KS) requires targeting of
cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (188830) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1;
e.g., 176875) to KCNQ1 through the targeting protein yotiao (604001).
Yotiao binds to KCNQ1 by a leucine zipper motif, which is disrupted by
an LQTS mutation (KCNQ1-G589D; 607542.0029). Identification of the KCNQ1
macromolecular complex provides a mechanism for sympathetic nervous
system modulation of cardiac action potential duration through I-KS.

Melman et al. (2004) showed that multiple segments of KCNQ1, including
the pore and C terminus, bind the accessory proteins KCNE1 and KCNE3
(604433). They demonstrated that all KCNE-binding sites of KCNQ1 are
required for proper regulation by the accessory subunit.

To resolve the controversy about messengers regulating KCNQ ion channels
during phospholipase C (see 600810)-mediated suppression of current, Suh
et al. (2006) designed translocatable enzymes that quickly altered the
phosphoinositide composition of the plasma membrane after application of
a chemical cue. The KCNQ current fell rapidly to zero when
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was depleted without changing
calcium ion, diacylglycerol, or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Current
rose by 30% when phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was overproduced
and did not change when phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate was
raised. Hence Suh et al. (2006) concluded that the depletion of
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate suffices to suppress current
fully, and other second messengers are not needed. Furthermore, their
development of these new compounds allowed additional study of biologic
signaling networks involving membrane phosphoinositides.

Roepke et al. (2009) demonstrated that both KCNQ1 and KCNE2 (603796)
were expressed and partially colocalized in human and mouse thyroid
glands with the basolaterally located Na(+)/I(-) symporter (NIS) that
mediates active I(-) transport, the first step in thyroid hormone
biosynthesis. Using the rat thyroid-derived FRTL5 cell line, the authors
detected endogenous expression of KCNQ1 and KCNE2 proteins that was
upregulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH; see 188540) or its
major downstream effector cAMP in the cell membrane fraction. The
authors identified a TSH-stimulated K(+) current in FRTL5 cells that
bore the signature linear current-voltage relationship of KCNQ1-KCNE2
channels and was inhibited by a KCNQ1-specific antagonist. Kcne2 -/-
pups nursing from Kcne2 -/- dams had an 87% reduction in thyroid I(-)
accumulation compared to wildtype pups. Roepke et al. (2009) concluded
that the potassium channel subunits KCNQ1 and KCNE2 form a
TSH-stimulated constitutively active thyrocyte K(+) channel that is
required for normal thyroid hormone biosynthesis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Long QT Syndrome

Discrepancies in the codon numbers of the allelic variants exist because
of changes in information about the sequence of KCNQ1. Yang et al.
(1997) demonstrated that the full-length KCNQ1 cDNA codes for 676 amino
acids. Thus, for example, the A341V mutation (607542.0010), one of the
most frequent causes of type 1 long QT syndrome (192500), was denoted
A212V by Wang et al. (1996) and A246V by Li et al. (1998).

Wang et al. (1996) found KVLQT1 mutations in affected members of 16
families with long QT syndrome-1, including 1 intragenic deletion and 10
different missense mutations (e.g., 607542.0001). Shalaby et al. (1997)
used site-directed mutagenesis to generate 3 mutant human KVLQT1 cDNAs,
equivalent to mutations previously described by Wang et al. (1996). The
corresponding mutant KVLQT1 proteins were coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes
with wildtype KVLQT1 and minK (176261) proteins. Channel currents were
studied using a voltage clamp technique. Shalaby et al. (1997) showed
that mutations in the putative cytoplasmic loop (e.g., 607542.0002) and
pore signature sequence (e.g., 607542.0008) abolished KVLQT1 activity
when expressed individually. A mutation in the transmembrane region
(e.g., 607542.0006) significantly reduced KVLQT1 activity. When
coexpressed with wildtype KVLQT1 protein with or without minK protein,
each mutant exerted a dominant-negative effect on the wildtype KVLQT1
current. Shalaby et al. (1997) concluded that in patients carrying such
mutant alleles, diminution in the repolarizing I(ks) current would
result in prolongation of the cardiac action potential and predispose to
cardiac arrhythmias.

Russell et al. (1996) used SSCP analysis to screen 2 large and 9 small
LQT families for mutations of the KVLQT1 potassium channel gene. They
identified a novel missense mutation in 2 unrelated families: a
gly314-to-ser substitution (607542.0012) in the KVLQT1 gene. In a third
family, an ala341-to-val substitution (607542.0010) resulted in the
spontaneous occurrence of LQT in monozygotic twin offspring of
unaffected parents. Russell et al. (1996) noted that mutations at this
same nucleotide had been observed in 8 of 19 LQT families determined to
have KVLQT1 mutations to that time, suggesting a mutation hotspot. Both
of the mutations reported in this study occurred at CpG dinucleotides.
Russell et al. (1996) observed that both of the mutations alter the
amino acid sequence in, or adjacent to, the pore of the channel and may
diminish the channel's ability to conduct a repolarizing potassium
current. Russell et al. (1996) reported that their data confirm the role
of KVLQT1 in LQT. They noted that all the KVLQT1 mutations reported to
that time were missense mutations and suggested that mutant KVLQT1
proteins may exert a dominant-negative effect on repolarizing potassium
currents by forming multimers with normal potassium channel protein
subunits, dramatically reducing the number of fully functional KVLQT1
channels.

Among 32 Japanese families with LQT, Tanaka et al. (1997) identified
mutations in KCNQ1 in 4 families comprising 16 patients.

Jongbloed et al. (1999) screened 24 Dutch LQTS families for mutations in
the KCNQ1 and HERG genes. Fourteen missense mutations were identified.
Eight of these missense mutations were novel: 3 in the KCNQ1 gene and 5
in the HERG gene. The KCNQ1 mutation G189R (607542.0003) and the novel
HERG mutation R582C (607542.0009) were detected in 2 families each.
Genotype-phenotype studies indicated that auditory stimuli trigger
cardiac events differentiating LQTS2 from LQTS1. In LQTS1, exercise was
the predominant trigger. In addition, a number of asymptomatic gene
defect carriers were identified. Jongbloed et al. (1999) concluded that
asymptomatic carriers are still at risk of the development of
life-threatening arrhythmias, underlining the importance of DNA analysis
for unequivocal diagnosis of patients with LQTS.

Neyroud et al. (1999) identified 5 novel mutations in LQTS patients
within the C-terminal part of KCNQ1 (see 607542.0025, 607542.0026, and
607542.0027). Neyroud et al. (1999) commented that the low mutation
detection rate in large cohorts of LQTS patients may reflect the fact
that the C-terminal region had not been analyzed to that time.

A comprehensive review of the genetic and molecular basis of long QT
syndromes was given by Priori et al. (1999, 1999).

In 2 severely affected sisters from a large Belgian family with LQTS,
Berthet et al. (1999) identified biallelic digenic mutations: a missense
mutation in the KCNQ1 gene (A341E; 607542.0009) and a splice site
mutation in the KCNH2 gene (2592+1G-A; 152427.0019). Berthet et al.
(1999) stated that this was the first description of double
heterozygosity in long QT syndrome.

Splawski et al. (2000) screened 262 unrelated individuals with LQT
syndrome for mutations in the 5 defined genes (KCNQ1; KCNH2, 152427;
SCN5A, 600163; KCNE1; and KCNE2) and identified mutations in 177
individuals (68%). KCNQ1 and KCNH2 accounted for 87% of mutations (42%
and 45%, respectively), and SCN5A, KCNE1, and KCNE2 for the remaining
13% (8%, 3%, and 2%, respectively).

Yang et al. (2002) analyzed the KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A genes in 92
patients with drug-induced long QT syndrome and identified 2 missense
mutations, 1 in KCNQ1 (607542.0031) and 1 in KCNH2 (152427.0014), not
found in 228 controls, that were shown to reduce K+ currents in vitro.

In a 13-year-old girl with long QT syndrome, Aizawa et al. (2004)
identified a frameshift mutation in the KCNQ1 gene (607542.0036) that
eliminates the S3 to S6 domains and the C terminus of the KCNQ1 channel.
Coexpression experiments in COS-7 cells showed that mutant and wildtype
KCNQ1 remained within the cytoplasm rather than being distributed to the
plasma membrane. Aizawa et al. (2004) suggested that the truncated
mutant forms a heteromultimer with wildtype KCNQ1 and causes a
dominant-negative effect due to a trafficking defect.

Tester et al. (2005) analyzed 5 LQTS-associated cardiac channel genes in
541 consecutive unrelated patients with LQT syndrome (average QTc, 482
ms). In 272 (50%) patients, they identified 211 different pathogenic
mutations, including 88 in KCNQ1, 89 in KCNH2, 32 in SCN5A, and 1 each
in KCNE1 and KCNE2. Mutations considered pathogenic were absent in more
than 1,400 reference alleles. Among the mutation-positive patients, 29
(11%) had 2 LQTS-causing mutations, of which 16 (8%) were in 2 different
LQTS genes (biallelic digenic). Tester et al. (2005) noted that patients
with multiple mutations were younger at diagnosis, but they did not
discern any genotype/phenotype correlations associated with location or
type of mutation.

In 44 unrelated patients with LQT syndrome, Millat et al. (2006) used
DHLP chromatography to analyze the KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, and KCNE2
genes for mutations and SNPs. Most of the patients (84%) showed a
complex molecular pattern, with an identified mutation associated with 1
or more SNPs located in several LQTS genes; 4 of the patients also had a
second mutation in a different LQTS gene (biallelic digenic inheritance;
see, e.g., 607542.0038 and 607542.0039).

Arbour et al. (2008) identified a missense mutation (607542.0040)
causing long QT syndrome-1 among a First Nations community of northern
British Columbia.

- Jervell and Lange-Nielsen Syndrome

Neyroud et al. (1997) used homozygosity mapping to locate the gene for
the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen cardioauditory syndrome (JLNS1; 220400) to
the same region of 11p15.5 where the KVLQT1 gene maps. In 3 affected
children of 2 families with the disorder, they demonstrated homozygosity
for a deletion-insertion mutation in the C-terminal domain of the KVLQT1
gene (607542.0013). They noted that this is another instance of dominant
or recessive inheritance of disorders due to different mutations in the
same gene. Schmitt et al. (2000) identified a small domain between
residues 589 and 620 in the KCNQ1 C terminus that may function as an
assembly domain for KCNQ1 subunits. KCNQ1 C termini do not assemble and
KCNQ1 subunits do not express functional potassium channels without this
domain. The authors showed that the deletion-insertion mutation at KCNQ1
residue 540 identified by Neyroud et al. (1997) eliminated important
parts of the C-terminal assembly domain. Therefore, JLNS mutants may be
defective in KCNQ1 subunit assembly. The results provided a molecular
basis for the clinical observation that heterozygous JLNS carriers show
slight cardiac dysfunction and that the severe JLNS phenotype is
characterized by the absence of the KCNQ1 channel.

Tyson et al. (2000) studied 10 JLNS families from Great Britain and
Norway and identified 9 different mutations in the KCNQ1 gene, 2 of
which were novel. Truncation of the protein proximal to the C-terminal
assembly domain was expected to preclude assembly of KCNQ1 monomers into
tetramers, explaining the recessive inheritance of JLNS.

- Familial Atrial Fibrillation

Chen et al. (2003) identified a missense mutation, ser140 to gly
(607542.0032), in the KCNQ1 gene in autosomal dominant atrial
fibrillation (607554). Functional analysis of this mutant revealed a
gain-of-function effect on the KCNQ1/KCNE1 and KCNQ1/KCNE2 currents,
which contrasts with the dominant-negative or loss-of-function effects
of the KCNQ1 mutations previously identified in patients with long QT
syndrome. Chen et al. (2003) concluded that the ser140-to-gly mutation
is likely to initiate and maintain atrial fibrillation by reducing
action potential duration and effective refractory period in atrial
myocytes.

- Short QT Syndrome

In a 70-year-old man with short QT syndrome-2 (SQT2; 609621) who
survived an episode of ventricular fibrillation, Bellocq et al. (2004)
identified a missense mutation in the KCNQ1 gene (607542.0037).
Functional studies of the mutant channel revealed that both a pronounced
shift of the half-activation potential and an acceleration of the
activation kinetics led to a gain of function in I(Ks).

- Imprinting

Genomic imprinting is the process by which a subset of mammalian genes
is 'marked' during gametogenesis such that they are expressed
differentially in somatic cells depending on their parental origin. This
mark may be differential methylation, because DNA methylation is
necessary for the proper regulation of imprinted genes. Furthermore,
some differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are thought to represent
gametic imprints, because they are differentially methylated in male and
female germ cells and remain so throughout development. The DMRs of most
imprinted genes are associated with short, G-rich, direct repeat
sequences, which may facilitate heterochromatization and gene silencing
at imprinted loci. Another characteristic of imprinted genes is their
association, in some cases, with imprinted antisense RNA transcripts. At
the paternally expressed mouse and human IGF2 (147470) and ZPF127 loci,
antisense transcripts that are also expressed paternally have been
identified and overlap with the protein coding gene. For the maternally
expressed IGF2R (147280) and UBE3A (601623) genes, overlapping antisense
transcripts have been found and are oppositely imprinted with respect to
the protein coding gene. Antisense transcripts may serve to regulate
overlapping genes by promoter or transcript occlusion or by competing
with these loci for regulatory elements such as transcription factors or
enhancers (Smilinich et al., 1999). Imprinting control elements are
proposed to exist within the KVLQT1 locus, because multiple chromosome
rearrangements associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS; 130650)
disrupt this gene.

Lee et al. (1997) demonstrated that the KVLQT1 gene spans much of the
interval between p57(KIP2) (CDKN1C; 600856) and IGF2 and that, like
those 2 genes, it is imprinted. They demonstrated, furthermore, that the
KVLQT1 gene is disrupted by chromosomal rearrangements in patients with
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, as well as by a balanced chromosomal
translocation in an embryonal rhabdoid tumor. They concluded that the
lack of parent-of-origin effect in the long QT syndrome (192500) must
reflect a relative lack of imprinting in the affected tissue, cardiac
muscle, thereby representing a novel mechanism for incomplete penetrance
of a human disease gene. Mannens and Wilde (1997) and Barlow (1997)
discussed the findings of Lee et al. (1997) and Neyroud et al. (1997)
and hypothesized that aberrant expression of the KVLQT1 gene may be
responsible for the profound growth abnormalities seen in BWS. Four
isoforms of KVLQT1 exist, 2 of which (isoforms 3 and 4) seem to be
untranslated. KVLQT1 imprinting may be associated with specific
isoforms, as has been shown for IGF2. KVLQT1 isoform 2 seems to be most
abundant in heart and is probably biallelically expressed. Isoform 1 is
expressed in multiple tissues and is most likely paternally imprinted.
The tissue-specific imprinting of KVLQT1 and the presence of multiple
isoforms might explain the various modes of inheritance seen in LQT,
JLNS, and BWS.

Smilinich et al. (1999) identified an evolutionarily conserved,
maternally methylated CpG island, which they called KVDMR1, in an intron
of the KVLQT1 gene. Among 12 cases of BWS with normal H19 methylation, 5
showed demethylation of KVDMR1 in fibroblast or lymphocyte DNA; on the
other hand, in 4 cases of BWS with H19 hypermethylation, methylation at
KVDMR1 was normal. Thus, inactivation of H19 and hypomethylation of
KVDMR1 (or an associated phenomenon) represented distinct epigenetic
anomalies associated with biallelic expression of IGF2. Reverse
transcription-PCR analysis of the human and syntenic mouse loci
identified a KVDMR1-associated RNA transcribed exclusively from the
paternal allele and in the opposite orientation with respect to the
maternally expressed KVLQT1 gene. Smilinich et al. (1999) proposed that
KVDMR1 and/or its associated antisense RNA represents an additional
imprinting control element or center in human 11p15.5 and mouse distal 7
imprinted domains.

To explore the importance of imprinted gene clustering, Cleary et al.
(2001) used the Cre/loxP recombination system to disrupt a cluster of
imprinted genes on mouse distal chromosome 7. In mice carrying a
site-specific translocation, t(7;11), separating Cdkn1c and Kcnq1,
imprinting of the genes retained on chromosome 7, including Kcnq1,
Kcnq1ot1 (604115), Ascl2 (601886), H19 (103280), and Igf2 (147470), was
unaffected, demonstrating that these genes are not regulated by elements
near or telomeric to Cdkn1c. In contrast, expression and imprinting of
the translocated Cdkn1c, Slc22a1l (602631), and Tssc3 (602131) genes on
chromosome 11 were affected, consistent with the hypothesis that
elements regulating both expression and imprinting of these genes lie
within or proximal to Kcnq1. The findings supported the proposal that
chromosomal abnormalities, including translocations, within KCNQ1 that
are associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome may disrupt CDKN1C
expression.

One-third of individuals with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome lose
maternal-specific methylation at KvDMR1, a putative imprinting control
region within intron 10 of the KCNQ1 gene (Lee et al., 1999; Smilinich
et al., 1999; Engel et al., 2000). It has been proposed that this
epimutation results in aberrant imprinting and, consequently, BWS.
Fitzpatrick et al. (2002) showed that paternal inheritance of this
mutation in mice results in the derepression in cis of 6 genes,
including Cdkn1c, which encodes cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C.
Furthermore, fetuses and adult mice that inherited the deletion from
their fathers were 20 to 25% smaller than their wildtype littermates. By
contrast, maternal inheritance of this deletion had no effect on
imprinted gene expression or growth. Thus, the unmethylated paternal
KvDMR1 allele regulates imprinted expression by silencing genes on the
paternal chromosome. These findings supported the hypothesis that loss
of methylation in BWS patients activates the repressive function of
KvDMR1 on the maternal chromosome, resulting in abnormal silencing of
CDKN1C and the development of BWS.

Mancini-DiNardo et al. (2003) showed that the imprinting control region
(ICR) on mouse distal chromosome 7 contains a promoter for a paternally
expressed antisense transcript, Kcnq1ot1. Three paternal-specific
nuclease-hypersensitive sites, which are required for full promoter
activity, lie immediately upstream from the start site. The expression
of Kcnq1ot1 during pre- and postnatal development was compared to that
of other imprinted genes in its vicinity, Cdkn1c (600856) and Kcnq1; a
lack of coordination in their expression did not support an enhancer
competition model for the action of the ICR in imprinting control. Using
a stable transfection assay, the authors showed that the region contains
a position-independent and orientation-independent silencer. The authors
proposed that the Kcnq1 ICR may function as a silencer on the paternal
chromosome to effect the repression of neighboring genes.

Imboden et al. (2006) investigated the distribution of mutant alleles
for the long-QT syndrome in 484 nuclear families with type I disease
(LQT1 due to mutation in the KCNQ1 gene) and 269 nuclear families with
type II disease (LQT2 (613688) due to mutation in the KCNH2 gene;
152427). In offspring of the female carriers of LQT1 or male and female
carriers of LQT2, classic mendelian inheritance ratios were not
observed. Among the 1,534 descendants, the proportion of genetically
affected offspring was significantly greater than that expected
according to mendelian inheritance: 870 were carriers of a mutation
(57%), and 664 were noncarriers (43%) (P less than 0.001). Among the 870
carriers, the allele for the long-QT syndrome was transmitted more often
to female offspring (476; 55%) than to male offspring (394; 45%) (P =
0.005). Increased maternal transmission of the long QT syndrome to
daughters was also observed, possibly contributing to the excess of
female patients with autosomal dominant long QT syndrome.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

The relation of ion channels to disease was comprehensively reviewed by
Ackerman and Clapham (1997).

In a large collaborative study, Zareba et al. (1998) demonstrated that
the genotype of the long QT syndrome influences the clinical course. The
risk of cardiac events (syncope, aborted cardiac arrest, or sudden
death) was significantly higher among subjects with mutations at the
LQT1 or LQT2 locus than among those with mutations at the LQT3 locus.
Although the cumulative mortality was similar regardless of the
genotype, the percentage of cardiac events that were lethal was
significantly higher in families with mutations at the LQT3 locus. In
this large study, 112 patients had mutations at the LQT1 locus, 72 at
the LQT2 locus, and 62 at the LQT3 locus. Thus, paradoxically, cardiac
events were less frequent in LQT3 but more likely to be lethal; the
likelihood of dying during a cardiac event was 20% in families with an
LQT3 mutation and 4% with either an LQT1 or an LQT2 mutation.

Using SSCP and DNA sequence analyses, Chen et al. (2003) studied the
KCNQ1 gene in 102 families with a history of lethal cardiac events: 55
LQTS, 9 Brugada syndrome (601144), 18 idiopathic ventricular
fibrillation (IVF; 603829), and 20 acquired LQTS. Families found to have
KCNQ1 mutations were phenotyped using ECG parameters and cardiac event
history, and genotype-phenotype correlation was performed. No mutations
were found in Brugada syndrome, IVF, or acquired LQTS families. Of the
55 LQTS families, 10 had KCNQ1 mutations and 62 carriers were
identified. Five novel mutations were identified. There were 6 instances
of sudden death and in 2 of these, death was the first symptom. The
findings of this study emphasized the reduced penetrance of both the
long QT and symptoms, resulting in diagnostic challenges, and the
importance of genetic testing for identification of gene carriers with
reduced penetrance in order to provide treatment and prevent lethal
cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death.

Westenskow et al. (2004) analyzed the KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, and
KCNE2 genes in 252 probands with long QT syndrome and identified 19 with
biallelic mutations in LQTS genes, of whom 18 were either compound
(monogenic) or double (digenic) heterozygotes and 1 was a homozygote.
They also identified 1 patient who had triallelic digenic mutations (see
152427.0021). Compared with probands who had 1 or no identified
mutation, probands with 2 mutations had longer QTc intervals (p less
than 0.001) and were 3.5-fold more likely to undergo cardiac arrest (p
less than 0.01). Voltage clamp studies in Xenopus oocytes coexpressing
wildtype and variant subunits demonstrated a reduction in I(Ks) density
that was equivalent to the additive effects of the single mutations.
Westenskow et al. (2004) concluded that biallelic mono- or digenic
mutations (which the authors termed 'compound mutations') cause a severe
phenotype and are relatively common in long QT syndrome. The authors
noted that these findings support the concept of arrhythmia risk as a
multi-hit process and suggested that genotype can be used to predict
risk.

ANIMAL MODEL

To produce a mouse model for Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome,
Casimiro et al. (2001) generated a line of transgenic mice that had a
targeted disruption in the Kcnq1 gene. Behavioral analysis demonstrated
that the homozygous-null mice were deaf and exhibited a shaker-waltzer
phenotype. Histologic analysis of the inner ear structures of these mice
showed gross morphologic anomalies because of drastic reduction in the
volume of endolymph. ECGs recorded from the null mice demonstrated
abnormal T- and P-wave morphologies and prolongation of the QT and JT
intervals when measured in vivo, but not in isolated hearts. These
changes were indicative of cardiac repolarization defects that appear to
be induced by extracardiac signals.

Casimiro et al. (2004) noted that Kcnq1 knockout results in mice with
more severe defects than those in human LQT1 or JLNS1. They developed
mouse lines with point mutations in the Kcnq1 gene that cause LQT1 in
humans. Mice with an ala340-to-glu mutation had normal hearing but a
long QT and therefore modeled patients with LQT1. Mice with a
thr311-to-ile mutation phenocopied JLNS1, but they also displayed the
shaker/waltzer defect, which is specific to mouse.

Imprinted genes are clustered in domains, and their allelic repression
is mediated by imprinting control regions. These imprinting control
regions are marked by DNA methylation, which is essential to maintain
imprinting in the embryo. To explore how imprinting is regulated in
placenta, Umlauf et al. (2004) studied the Kcnq1 domain on mouse distal
chromosome 7. This large domain is controlled by an intronic imprinting
control region (Fitzpatrick et al., 2002; Mancini-DiNardo et al., 2003)
and comprises multiple genes that are imprinted in placenta, without the
involvement of promoter DNA methylation. Umlauf et al. (2004) found that
the paternal repression along the domain involves acquisition of
trimethylation at lys27 and dimethylation at lys9 of histone H3 (see
602810). Eed (605984)-Ezh2 (601573) Polycomb complexes are recruited to
the paternal chromosome and potentially regulate its repressive histone
methylation. Studies on embryonic stem cells and early embryos supported
the proposal of Umlauf et al. (2004) that chromatin repression is
established early in development and is maintained in the placenta. In
the embryo, on the other hand, imprinting is stably maintained only at
genes that have promoter DNA methylation. Random X inactivation in the
embryo proper also involves repressive histone methylation and
recruitment of Eed-Ezh2 complexes (Silva et al., 2003). Umlauf et al.
(2004) concluded that their data underscored the importance of histone
methylation in placental imprinting and identified mechanistic
similarities with X chromosome inactivation in extraembryonic tissues,
suggesting that the 2 epigenetic mechanisms are evolutionarily linked.

Studying imprinting in the placenta in the region of distal mouse
chromosome 7, Lewis et al. (2004) found that the silent paternal alleles
of imprinted genes are marked in the trophoblast by repressive histone
modifications (dimethylation at lys9 of histone H3 and trimethylation at
lys27 of histone H3), which were disrupted when imprinting center-2
(IC2) on mouse distal chromosome 7 was deleted. The deletion led to
reactivation of the paternal alleles. Lewis et al. (2004) proposed that
an evolutionarily older imprinting mechanism limited to extraembryonic
tissues was based on histone modifications.

Elso et al. (2004) characterized 2 mouse lines carrying mutant alleles
of Kcnq1, which very rapidly established chronic gastritis in a
bacterial pathogen-exposed environment. Independent of infection, mutant
mice developed gastric hyperplasia, hypochlorhydria, and mucin
dysregulation, as well as metaplasia, dysplasia, and premalignant
adenomatous hyperplasia of the stomach.

Using pharmacologic inhibition and gene knockout in mice, Vallon et al.
(2005) demonstrated the importance of Kcnq1 channel complexes in
maintenance of the driving force for proximal tubular and intestinal Na+
absorption, gastric acid secretion, and cAMP-induced jejunal Cl-
secretion. In the kidney, Kcnq1 was dispensable under basal conditions;
however, luminal Kcnq1 repolarized the proximal tubule and stabilized
the driving force for Na+ reabsorption under conditions of increased
glucose or amino acid resorption. In mice lacking functional Kcnq1,
impaired intestinal absorption was associated with reduced serum vitamin
B12 concentrations, mild macrocytic anemia, and fecal loss of Na+ and
K+, the latter affecting K+ homeostasis.

In studies of Drosophila, Ocorr et al. (2007) observed a markedly
elevated incidence of cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias in aging fruit
fly hearts and a concomitant decrease in expression of Kcnq, which is
the Drosophila homolog of human KCNQ1. Hearts from young Kcnq-mutant
fruit flies exhibited arrhythmias reminiscent of torsade de pointes and
had severely increased susceptibility to pacing-induced cardiac
dysfunction at young ages, characteristics that are observed only at
advanced ages in wildtype flies. Alterations in rhythmicity of the
mutant flies was rescued by transgenic wildtype Kcnq, and heart-specific
Kcnq overexpression in old wildtype flies reversed the age-dependent
increase in arrhythmias. Ocorr et al. (2007) suggested that an
age-dependent decrease in KCNQ1 expression within the heart may
contribute to the increased incidence of arrhythmia observed with age.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, 3-BP DEL

Using SSCP analysis, Wang et al. (1996) demonstrated a deletion in the
KVLQT1 gene in a sporadic case of LQT1 (192500). Deletion of 3
nucleotides, TCG, changed codon 72 from TTC (phe) to TGG (trp) and
deleted the first G of codon 73. (Codon 72 used to be known as codon 38
and codon 73 as codon 39.)

.0002
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, ALA178PRO

Using SSCP analysis, Wang et al. (1996) found a GCC (ala) to CCC (pro)
transversion in codon 83 of the KVLQT1 gene in a sporadic case of LQT1
(192500). (This variant used to be known as ALA49PRO and ALA83PRO.)

.0003
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, GLY189ARG

In a family in which 3 members had LQT1 (192500), Wang et al. (1996)
demonstrated a GGG (gly) to AGG (arg) transition in codon 189 of the
KVLQT1 gene. Jongbloed et al. (1999) identified this mutation in 2
families with LQT1. (This variant used to be known as GLY60ARG and
GLY94ARG.)

.0004
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, ARG190GLN

In a family with 2 members affected by LQT1 (192500), Wang et al. (1996)
used SSCP analysis to demonstrate a CGG (arg) to CAG (gln) transition in
codon 95 of the KVLQT1 gene. (This variant used to be known as ARG61GLN
and ARG95GLN.)

Moretti et al. (2010) reported the creation of patient-specific induced
pluripotent stem (IPS) cells containing the R190Q mutation in KCNQ1.
They compared IPS cells derived from dermal fibroblasts from 2 patients
with this mutation with those from 2 control individuals. The cells were
able to generate functional myocytes that showed a ventricular, atrial,
or nodal phenotype, as evidenced by expression of cell type-specific
markers and as seen in recordings of the action potentials in single
cells. The duration of the action potential was markedly prolonged in
ventricular and atrial cells derived from patients with LQTS1, as
compared with cells from control subjects. Further characterization of
the role of the R190Q KCNQ1 mutation in the pathogenesis of LQTS1
revealed a dominant-negative trafficking defect associated with a 70 to
80% reduction in I(Ks) current and altered channel activation and
deactivation properties. Moreover, Moretti et al. (2010) showed that
myocytes derived from patients with LQTS1 had an increased
susceptibility to catecholamine-induced tachyarrhythmia and that
beta-blockade attenuated this phenotype, as was demonstrated in the
patients themselves.

.0005
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, VAL254MET

In a kindred in which 70 members were affected by LQT1 (192500), Wang et
al. (1996) used SSCP analysis to demonstrate a GTG (val) to ATG (met)
transition in codon 159 of the KVLQT1 gene. (This variant used to be
known as VAL125MET and VAL159MET.)

.0006
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, LEU273PHE

In a kindred in which 2 members were affected by LQT1 (192500), Wang et
al. (1996) demonstrated a CTC (leu) to TTC (phe) transition in codon 273
of the KVLQT1 gene. (This variant used to be known as LEU144PHE and
LEU178PHE.)

.0007
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, GLY306ARG

In a sporadic case of LQT1 (192500), Wang et al. (1996) demonstrated a
GGG (gly) to AGG (arg) transition in codon 211 of the KVLQT1 gene. (This
mutation used to be known as GLY177ARG and GLY211ARG.)

.0008
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, THR312ILE

In a sporadic case of LQT1 (192500), Wang et al. (1996) demonstrated a
ACC (thr) to ATC (ile) transition in codon 217 of the KVLQT1 gene. (This
mutation used to be known as THR183ILE and THR217ILE.)

.0009
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
LONG QT SYNDROME 1/2, DIGENIC, INCLUDED
KCNQ1, ALA341GLU

In 2 kindreds with 8 members affected by LQT1 (192500), Wang et al.
(1996) demonstrated a GCG (ala) to GAG (glu) transversion in codon 341
(A341E) of the KCNQ1 gene. (This variant used to be known as ALA212GLU
and ALA246GLU.)

In 2 severely affected sisters from a large Belgian family with long QT
syndrome (see 192500), Berthet et al. (1999) identified biallelic
digenic mutations: the A341E substitution in exon 6, within the S6
transmembrane domain of KCNQ1; and a splice site mutation in the KCNH2
gene (2592+1G-A; 152427.0019). The father and his affected relatives
were heterozygous for the A341E mutation in KCNQ1; the mother, a more
mildly affected sister, and a grandson were heterozygous for the splice
site mutation in KCNH2. Neither mutation was found in 2 unaffected sibs
or in other unaffected family members. Berthet et al. (1999) stated that
this was the first description of double heterozygosity in long QT
syndrome.

.0010
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, ALA341VAL

In 5 kindreds with 47 members affected by LQT1 (192500), Wang et al.
(1996) demonstrated a GCG (ala) to GTG (val) transversion in codon 341
of the KVLQT1 gene. Russell et al. (1996) detected this mutation in the
spontaneous occurrence of LQT in monozygotic twin offspring of normal
parents. This mutation would be expected to encode a potassium channel
with altered conductance properties. They noted that mutations at this
same nucleotide have been observed in 8 of 19 LQT families determined to
have KVLQT1 mutations to that time, suggesting a mutation hotspot. (This
variant used to be known as ALA212VAL and ALA246VAL.)

.0011
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, GLY345GLU

In a family with 11 members affected by LQT1 (192500), Wang et al.
(1996) demonstrated a GGG (gly) to GAG (glu) transversion in codon 250
of the KVLQT1 gene. (This variant used to be known as GLY216GLU and
GLY250GLU.)

.0012
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, GLY314SER

Russell et al. (1996) reported a mutation resulting in a gly219-to-ser
substitution in 2 LQT1 (192500) families. (This variant used to be known
as GLY185SER and GLY219SER.) This mutation would be expected to encode a
potassium channel with altered conductance properties.

.0013
JERVELL AND LANGE-NIELSEN SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, 7-BP DEL/8-BP INS, NT1244

In 3 children with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen cardioauditory syndrome
(JLNS1; 220400) from 2 consanguineous families, Neyroud et al. (1997)
found homozygosity for a deletion-insertion mutation in the C-terminal
domain of the KVLQT1 gene. At nucleotide 1244, a deletion of 7 bp and an
insertion of 8 bp was found in affected individuals. The mutation
resulted in a frameshift from codon 415, leading to a premature stop
signal at codon 522 close to the end of the coding sequence, which is at
codon 547. Several other members of the 2 families were heterozygous for
the mutation. Both families originated from Kabylia, which suggested
founder effect.

.0014
JERVELL AND LANGE-NIELSEN SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, 1-BP INS, 282G

In a patient with Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome (220400), Splawski
et al. (1997) found homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion (G) after
nucleotide 282 of the KVLQT1 gene. The insertion caused a frameshift,
disrupting the coding sequence after the second putative
membrane-spanning domain of the KVLQT1 protein and leading to a
premature stop codon at nucleotide 564. The proband was born to
second-cousin parents. At 35 weeks' gestation, the obstetrician informed
the mother that the fetal heart rate had dropped to 70 to 80 beats per
minute. At 38 weeks, the heart rate continued to be slow, and slow heart
rate persisted after birth. One hour after delivery, at the time of the
first bottle feeding, the infant had cyanosis and hypotonia. A diagnosis
of LQT was made and treatment with propranolol was started. On the
eighth day, audiograms indicated bilateral sensory deafness. The family
members were not evaluated at that time. Seven months after the delivery
of the proband, the mother had a cardiac arrest and died when her alarm
clock sounded. She was exhausted and very anxious at the time.
Investigation of the family demonstrated an extensive involvement of
many members with typical heterozygous LQT. Linkage analysis showed that
the disorder mapped to the KVLQT1 region on 11p15.5.

.0015
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, ARG555CYS

In a study of 20 WRS (LQT1; 192500) families originating from France,
Donger et al. (1997) identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1663
of the KVLQT1 gene causing a missense arg555-to-cys substitution in the
C-terminal domain. In 3 large kindreds, there was a total of 44 carriers
of this mutation. Only 5 living subjects experienced syncope and there
were 2 sudden deaths. Syncope or death occurred only in the presence of
drugs known to modify ventricular repolarization (terfenadine,
disopyramide, meflaquine, and diuretics). Carriers of the arg555-to-cys
mutation had only minor or no prolongation of the QT interval. Donger et
al. (1997) proposed that this allelic variant causes a forme fruste LQT1
phenotype.

.0016
JERVELL AND LANGE-NIELSEN SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, TRP305SER

In 2 consanguineous Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS1; 220400)
families, Neyroud et al. (1998) identified a trp305-to-ser mutation in
the pore region of KCNQ1 by PCR-SSCP analysis. In contrast to several
missense mutations found in the same region of the KCNQ1 gene in
heterozygous state in Ward-Romano syndrome patients, which are
associated with severe cardiac phenotypes, the heterozygous state of the
W305S mutation yielded an apparently normal phenotype. This is the same
phenomenon as that observed in a number of other situations: different
mutations in the same gene produce a phenotype that may be recessive or
dominant and the phenotype may be the same or different in the case of
the 2 modes of inheritance.

.0017
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, ALA300THR

Priori et al. (1998) described a 9-year-old boy with classic Romano-Ward
syndrome (LQT1; 192500) (syncope, prolonged QT interval, normal
audiogram) born to second cousins. Two brothers of the proband had died
suddenly, one at rest and the other while swimming. Sequence analysis in
the proband demonstrated a novel homozygous missense mutation, a G-to-A
transition resulting in an alanine-to-threonine amino acid substitution
at position 300 of the KVLQT1 protein. Both parents were heterozygous
for this mutation and had normal QT intervals. None of 100 control
chromosomes exhibited this mutation. Coexpression of the mutant KVLQT1
protein with minK (176261) in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated a mild
electrophysiologic effect on ion flux. The authors commented that this
mutation in the homozygous state caused Romano-Ward syndrome and not
Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome (220400), citing it as evidence for a
recessive variant of Romano-Ward syndrome.

.0018
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, 3-BP DEL, PHE339DEL

After identifying a 10-year-old boy with long QT syndrome (192500) after
a near-drowning that required defibrillation from torsade de pointes,
Ackerman et al. (1998) evaluated first-degree relatives and found a
4-generation family comprising 26 individuals with 4 additional
symptomatic and 8 asymptomatic members harboring an abnormally prolonged
QT interval. Linkage to the 11p15.5 region was found with a maximum lod
score of 3.36. A mutation search revealed a 3-bp deletion resulting in
an in-frame deletion of codon 339 for phenylalanine. Ackerman et al.
(1998) pointed out that the delF339 mutation is closely situated to
codon 341, which is the site of 2 common mutations, A341V (607542.0010)
and A341E (607542.0009).

.0019
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, 9-BP DEL, NT373

In a 19-year-old woman with LQT1 (192500) who had been asymptomatic but
who died after a near-drowning, Ackerman et al. (1999) demonstrated by
molecular tests at autopsy a 9-bp deletion involving nucleotides 373
through 381 of the KCNQ1 gene. The 9-bp deletion (GCCGCGCCC) resulted in
an in-frame deletion of 3 amino acids (alanine, alanine, and proline)
from position 71 through 73 in the cytoplasmic N-terminal region of the
KCNQ1 ion channel subunit. The woman's maternal grandfather, mother, and
18-year-old sister also had the 9-bp deletion. It appears that a
substantial number of unexplained drownings may have a basis in the long
QT syndrome. Although the mother had electrocardiographic changes of
long QT syndrome, the 18-year-old sister who was a carrier had equivocal
or normal electrocardiogram in the view of half a panel of expert
electrocardiographers. The resuscitation of the proband, although
ultimately unsuccessful because of the extended period of anoxia, did
allow electrocardiographic documentation of QT prolongation, which was a
notable finding, given the entirely asymptomatic personal and family
history.

.0020
LONG QT SYNDROME 1, RECESSIVE
KCNQ1, ARG518TER

Larsen et al. (1999) described a Swedish family in which the proband and
his brother suffered from severe Romano-Ward syndrome (LQT1; 192500)
associated with compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the KCNQ1
gene: R518X and A525T. The mutations were found to segregate as
heterozygotes in the maternal and paternal lineage, respectively. None
of the heterozygotes exhibited clinical long QT syndrome. No hearing
defects were found in the proband. The data strongly indicated that
compound heterozygosity for these 2 mutations is the cause of the
autosomal recessive form of RWS in this family. A recessive variant of
the Ward-Romano long QT syndrome (607542.0017) was suggested by Priori
et al. (1998) on the basis of a finding of homozygosity in a
consanguineous family. Larsen et al. (1999) suggested that 'sporadic
RWS' should be considered as potentially recessive RWS, and efforts made
to determine the molecular defects and identify carriers in the family,
since they may be at risk of dying suddenly from drug-induced LQTS.

KCNQ1, 2-BP DEL

Chen et al. (1999) reported a small Amish family in which 2 sibs
fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for JLNS (220400). Both were
homozygous for a novel 2-bp deletion in the S2 transmembrane domain of
KVLQT1. This mutation predicts a frameshift leading to protein
truncation. The protein product was predicted to be functionless due to
most transmembrane domains and the pore region of the KVLQT1 protein
having been deleted.

.0023
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, IVS5, -1

Murray et al. (1999) examined a French LQTS (192500) family and found a
novel G-to-C transversion at position 922 -1 in the splice acceptor site
of intron 5 of the KCNQ1 gene. The effect on splicing efficiency was not
determined.

.0024
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, CODON 344 SPLICE MUTATION

Murray et al. (1999) found linkage to KCNQ1 in a families with LQTS
(192500) and detected a G-to-C transversion at position 1032 within the
last codon of exon 6. The coded alanine was conserved. RT-PCR from fresh
blood samples from the proband and his affected mother demonstrated
transcripts lacking exons 6 and 7. Transcripts lacking exon 7 were also
found in lymphocyte DNA from a patient with this mutation and in normal
cardiac tissue from a patient without LQTS. The reading frame remained
intact, resulting in the deletion of the pore, or S6, domain. These
observations suggested that the G-to-C transversion in the exon 6/intron
7 consensus splice donor sequence affects splicing efficiency.

The authors also found a G-to-A transition at position 1032 in 2
unrelated French families. This had been independently reported in 5
other families by Li et al. (1998) and Kanters et al. (1998). Murray et
al. (1999) suggested that base position 1032 represented a mutation
hotspot within KCNQ1. The commonest site for mutation is codon 341, in
association with a methylated CpG dinucleotide.

LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KNCQ1, 1-BP INS

In affected individuals in a family with Romano-Ward syndrome (LQT1;
192500), Neyroud et al. (1999), detected insertion of a C at nucleotide
position 1893 in exon 15. This created a frameshift with a premature
stop codon 19 amino acids later, resulting in a largely intact protein.

.0026
JERVELL AND LANGE-NIELSEN SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, 20-BP DEL, NT1892

Neyroud et al. (1999) found that a male with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen
syndrome (JLNS1; 220400) was a compound heterozygote for a frameshift
mutation in exon 15 and another mutation that was not identified. The
frameshift, caused by a 20-bp deletion at nucleotide position 1892,
created a premature stop codon 13 amino acids later.

JERVELL AND LANGE-NIELSEN SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, THR587MET

Neyroud et al. (1999) reported that a male patient with Jervell
Lange-Nielsen syndrome (220400) was a compound heterozygote. One of the
mutations, a de novo missense C-to-T transition at base position 1760,
changed a threonine to a methionine within exon 14. The other mutation
was a maternally derived splice mutation in intron 1.

KCNQ1, GLY589ASP

Piippo et al. (2001) identified a novel missense mutation in Finns with
Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (220400) or long QT syndrome
(192500). The mutation, a glycine-to-aspartic acid substitution at codon
589 (G589D) in the C terminus of the KCNQ1 subunit, was identified in
homozygous state in 2 sibs with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome and
in heterozygous state in 34 of 114 probands with Romano-Ward syndrome
and 282 family members. The mean rate-corrected QT intervals of the 316
heterozygous subjects and 423 noncarriers were 460 +/- 40 ms and 410 +/-
20 ms (p less than 0.001), respectively. Piippo et al. (2001) concluded
that the G589D mutation accounts for 30% of Finnish cases with long QT
syndrome and may be associated with both Romano-Ward and Jervell and
Lange-Nielsen phenotypes of the syndrome. They suggested that the
relative enrichment of this mutation most likely represents a founder
gene effect.

KCNQ1, PRO117LEU

Schwartz et al. (2001) identified 2 Italian families with LQT1 (192500)
with the same heterozygous 350C-T transition in the KCNQ1 gene,
resulting in a pro117-to-leu substitution. In 1 family, an infant had
died of SIDS and was found postmortem to have a de novo mutation. In the
other family, several members had long QT syndrome. The mutation was not
found in 800 reference alleles of Italian origin.

KCNQ1, ARG583CYS

In a patient with long QT syndrome (192500), Splawski et al. (2000)
identified heterozygosity for a 1747C-T transition in exon 15 of the
KCNQ1 gene, resulting in an arg583-to-cys (R583C) substitution.

In a patient who developed QT prolongation and torsade de pointes while
taking the drug dofetilide (see 192500), Yang et al. (2002) identified
heterozygosity for an R583C mutation in the KCNQ1 gene. The mutation was
not found in 228 controls. In vitro expression studies of the mutant
protein confirmed a significant reduction in potassium currents,
suggesting that the R583C mutation was responsible for the patient's
response to dofetilide.

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 3
KCNQ1, SER140GLY

In a 4-generation family with autosomal dominant atrial fibrillation
(607554) from Shandong Province, China, Chen et al. (2003) identified an
A-to-G substitution at nucleotide 418 of the KCNQ1 gene leading to a
ser-to-gly substitution at codon 140 in all affected family members.
This mutation was not observed in normal individuals in the family with
1 exception, which Chen et al. (2003) ascribed to delayed manifestation
or incomplete penetrance. The mutation was absent in 188 healthy control
individuals. The serine at position 140 is well conserved among
different species and is located in the S1 transmembrane segment of
KCNQ1 in a position close to the extracellular surface of the plasma
membrane.

KCNQ1, GLY269SER

Reardon et al. (1993) reported a family in which the proband had a
cardiac arrest at 4 years of age; she and her brother were then found to
have a QTc of 490 ms. The parents of the proband were first cousins and
there were hearing abnormalities reported in several family members. It
was uncertain whether the diagnosis should be Romano-Ward syndrome
(192500), which is dominant, or Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome
(220400), which is recessive. Murray et al. (2002) identified a
gly269-to-ser (G269S) mutation in the KCNQ1 gene in homozygous state in
the proband and her brother. Functional studies indicated that the
mutation had both recessive and dominant characteristics.

LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, GLY269ASP

In 8 affected members of a family with a severe form of dominantly
inherited Romano-Ward syndrome (192500), 5 of whom had sudden deaths,
Donger et al. (1997) identified a gly269-to-asp (G269D) mutation in the
KCNQ1 gene.

.0035
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, VAL254MET AND VAL417MET

Wedekind et al. (2004) described a 4-generation family with long QT
syndrome (192500) in which 7 members were carriers of 2 amino acid
alterations in cis in the KCNQ1 gene: val254 to met (V254M) and val417
to met (V417M). Voltage clamp recordings of mutant KCNQ1 protein in
Xenopus oocytes showed that only the V254M mutation reduced the I(Ks)
current and that the effect of the V417M variant was negligible. The
family exhibited the complete clinical spectrum of the disease, from
asymptomatic patients to victims of sudden death before beta-blocker
therapy. Of 9 family members, 1 female died suddenly before treatment, 3
females of the second generation were asymptomatic, and 4 members of the
third and fourth generations were symptomatic. All mutation carriers
were treated with beta-blockers and remained asymptomatic for a
follow-up of up to 23 years.

.0036
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, 1-BP DEL/2-BP INS, NT533

In a 13-year-old girl with long QT syndrome (192500), Aizawa et al.
(2004) identified a C-to-GG substitution at nucleotide 533 in the KCNQ1
gene, causing a frameshift at alanine-178 and resulting in a truncated
protein with elimination of the S3 to S6 domains and the C terminus of
the KCNQ1 channel. Coexpression experiments in COS-7 cells showed that
mutant and wildtype KCNQ1 remained within the cytoplasm rather than
being distributed to the plasma membrane, suggesting that the truncated
mutant forms a heteromultimer with wildtype KCNQ1 and causes a
dominant-negative effect due to a trafficking defect.

.0037
SHORT QT SYNDROME 2
KCNQ1, VAL307LEU

In a 70-year-old man with short QT syndrome-2 (SQT2; 609621) who
survived an episode of ventricular fibrillation, Bellocq et al. (2004)
identified a 919G-C transversion in the KCNQ1 gene, resulting in a
val307-to-leu (V307L) substitution. Functional studies of the mutant
channel revealed that both a pronounced shift of the half-activation
potential and an acceleration of the activation kinetics led to a gain
of function in I(Ks).

.0038
LONG QT SYNDROME 1/2, DIGENIC
KCNQ1, 1-BP DEL, 562T

In a female infant with a family history of sudden death, who had
severe, continuous bradycardia in utero that was confirmed after birth
and a QTc of 485 ms (see 192500), Millat et al. (2006) identified
biallelic digenic mutations: a 1-bp deletion (562delT) in exon 2 of the
KCNQ1 gene, causing a frameshift at trp188, and an insertion in the
KCNH2 gene (2775insG; 152427.0020).

.0039
LONG QT SYNDROME 1/2, DIGENIC
KCNQ1, ARG243PRO

In a female infant with fetal and neonatal bradycardia and a QTc of 570
ms (see 192500), Millat et al. (2006) identified biallelic digenic
mutations: a 728G-C transversion in exon 4 of the KCNQ1 gene, resulting
in an arg243-to-pro (R243P) substitution, and a missense mutation in the
KCNH2 gene (R948C; 152427.0022).

.0040
LONG QT SYNDROME 1
KCNQ1, VAL205MET

In 2 severely affected index cases with long QT syndrome (LQT1; 192500)
from a First Nations community in northern British Columbia (Gitxsan),
Arbour et al. (2008) identified a G-to-A transition in exon 4 of the
KCNQ1 gene that resulted in a val-to-met substitution at codon 205
(V205M). Identification of the mutation prompted the ascertainment of
122 relatives using community-based participatory research principles.
The 22 further mutation carriers identified had a significantly higher
mean corrected QT interval than noncarriers (465 +/- 28 milliseconds vs
434 +/- 26 milliseconds, P less than 0.0001); however, 30% of carriers
had a corrected QT interval below 440 milliseconds. In transfected mouse
Itk cells this mutation suppressed I(Ks) by causing a dramatic
depolarizing shift in activation voltage coupled with acceleration of
channel deactivation. Arbour et al. (2008) concluded that this mutation
likely conferred increased susceptibility to arrhythmias because of
decreased I(Ks) current. Even with a common mutation within a relatively
homogeneous population, clinical expression remains variable, supporting
the difficulty of definitive diagnosis without genetic testing.

605562	TITLE *605562 SECRETOGLOBIN, FAMILY 2A, MEMBER 2; SCGB2A2
;;MAMMAGLOBIN 1; MGB1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a modified differential display PCR technique, Watson and Fleming
(1994) isolated sequence fragments that were abundantly expressed in a
breast tumor relative to normal breast tissue. Using this fragment,
RT-PCR, and RACE, Watson and Fleming (1996) isolated a novel full-length
cDNA clone, which they designated mammaglobin-1 (MGB1). MGB1 encodes a
deduced 93-amino acid protein with a 19-amino acid hydrophobic peptide
signal sequence and a predicted molecular mass of 10.5-kD. The protein
shares 42% sequence identity with the rat prostatein protein (rPSC3). It
also shares high homology with rabbit and human uteroglobin (UGB;
192020) genes, including the conservation of cysteines known to play a
role in disulfide bond formation between uteroglobin subunits and a
conserved tyrosine required for progesterone binding to the uteroglobin
dimer. Watson et al. (1998) reported that the arrangement and splice
sites of the 3 exons of MGB1, UGB, and rPSC3 are well conserved,
suggesting that these genes constitute a multigene family derived from a
common ancestral sequence. The mammaglobin gene itself, however, is not
well conserved phylogenetically.

GENE FUNCTION

Because other uteroglobin gene family members are regulated by steroid
hormones, Watson et al. (1998) analyzed the MGB1 gene promoter for
steroid-responsive elements. They identified 2 imperfect elements
similar to estrogen- and androgen-response elements. Additionally, the
promoter contains a polyoma enhancer-related (PEA3, or ETV4; 600711)
motif. PEA3 is associated with activation of vimentin (193060)
transcription in mammary epithelial cells and overexpression of ERBB2
(164870) in human breast tumors. Watson et al. (1998) also identified
binding sites for the Sp family of transcription factors, an Ap-1
consensus site, and a binding site similar to the binding site of
pregnancy-specific mammary factor in the MGB1 promoter. They did not
observe any modulation of MGB1 transcription by estradiol, progesterone,
dexamethasone, or androgens.

Using Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR, Watson and Fleming (1996)
detected low level, breast-restricted expression of a 0.5-kb MGB1
transcript. They also detected MGB1 expression in several breast
carcinoma cell lines but not in primary breast myoepithelial cells,
primary breast stromal cells, an immortalized breast cell line, or an
immortalized luminal ductal breast cell line. In the cell lines
displaying the highest levels of expression, they also detected a 3-kb
transcript, which they hypothesized was unprocessed nuclear mRNA. Watson
and Fleming (1996) found that 8 of 35 primary breast carcinomas
overexpressed MGB1 relative to normal breast tissue specimens, and
Watson et al. (1998) found that 5 of 10 breast carcinoma cell lines and
13 of 21 metastatic breast tumors exhibited high levels of MGB1 mRNA.
The overexpression did not appear to correlate with histology, tumor
grade, tumor stage, or hormone receptor status. Watson and Fleming
(1996) concluded that MGB1 expression is mammary-specific and may define
a unique phenotype to a subset of breast carcinoma cell lines. Watson et
al. (1998) presented preliminary data suggesting that expression of MGB1
is not associated with lactation, but instead with mammary gland
proliferation and terminal differentiation.

GENE STRUCTURE

The human MGB1 gene comprises 3 exons (Watson et al., 1998).

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid analysis,
Watson et al. (1998) mapped the MGB1 gene to 11q12.3-q13.1. They
detected a second FISH signal on 15q23-q24, indicating a possible
homologous gene sequence. Chromosome 11q13 is frequently amplified in
breast carcinomas, but Watson et al. (1998) did not detect gene
amplification or gross rearrangements in breast tumors or cell lines.

606909	TITLE *606909 VESICLE-ASSOCIATED MEMBRANE PROTEIN 4; VAMP4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

VAMP4 is a member of the vesicle-associated membrane protein family of
trafficking proteins.

CLONING

Advani et al. (1998) used an EST identified through a database search to
obtain a corresponding human VAMP4 germinal center B-cell clone. The
predicted 141-amino acid protein contains an amphipathic helix that may
participate in coiled-coil interactions and a C-terminal hydrophobic
domain predicted to serve as a membrane anchor. Northern blot analysis
detected transcripts of 1.4, 2.4, and 5.6 kb that are broadly expressed
and abundant in heart. Transfection into normal rat kidney cells
resulted in a punctate juxtanuclear staining pattern that partially
overlaps with syntaxin-6 (STX6; 603944), a marker for the trans-Golgi
network. By Western blot analysis, Steegmaier et al. (1999) identified a
single 18-kD protein expressed in all rat tissues examined except
skeletal muscle, with highest expression in brain and testis. They also
found expression in all mammalian cell lines tested. By
immunoprecipitation of rat brain detergent extracts, Steegmaier et al.
(1999) found that VAMP4 exists in a complex with syntaxin-6.

GENE FUNCTION

Steegmaier et al. (1999) suggested that VAMP4 plays a role in
trans-Golgi network-to-endosome transport.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the VAMP4
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG54007). Scott (2002) mapped VAMP4 to
1q24-q25 based on sequence similarity between VAMP4 (GenBank GENBANK
AF044310) and a BAC (GenBank GENBANK AL035296) mapped to this location.

603955	TITLE *603955 FLAVIN-CONTAINING MONOOXYGENASE 2; FMO2
;;FMO, PULMONARY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The flavin-containing monooxygenases (EC 1.14.13.8) are NADPH-dependent
flavoenzymes that catalyze the oxidation of heteroatom centers in
numerous drugs and xenobiotics. Human FMO2 is expressed in lung and is
present in 2 isoforms. The most common isoform, FMO2*2A, contains a
premature stop codon encoding a truncated, inactive protein. The other,
full-length isoform, FMO2*1, is functional and has been found in African
Americans and Hispanic populations (Krueger et al., 2002; Krueger et
al., 2004).

CLONING

By screening a human lung cDNA library with rabbit FMO2 cDNA, Phillips
et al. (1995) cloned the FMO2 gene. The predicted 535-amino acid protein
has a molecular mass of 60,903 Da. Northern blot analysis detected FMO2
mRNA predominantly in adult lung.

By screening a human lung cDNA library with a rabbit FMO2 cDNA, Dolphin
et al. (1998) isolated human FMO2. Two transcripts were identified: a
minor transcript encoding a deduced 535-amino acid protein, and a major
transcript containing a premature stop at codon 472, resulting in a
truncated protein that is 64 residues shorter than the FMO2 proteins of
other mammals such as rabbit, guinea pig, and macaque monkey. RNase
protection assays indicated that the human FMO2 gene was expressed in
fetal, and predominantly adult, lung. However, Dolphin et al. (1998)
noted that a previous study had shown that FMO2 protein was undetectable
by Western blot analysis in all but 1 of 29 human lung samples (Williams
et al., 1990).

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of somatic cell hybrids, McCombie et al. (1996) mapped
the FMO2 gene to 1q, a region containing the FMO1 (136130), FMO3
(136132), and FMO4 (136131) genes.

GENE FUNCTION

Whetstine et al. (2000) analyzed the frequency and function of 2 human
FMO2 point mutations: 1414C-T that results in a truncated, inactive
protein, and 1589insT that results in a frameshift and disrupts the C
terminus of the protein. Whetstine et al. (2000) found that while 100%
of Caucasians and Koreans studied were homozygous for the 1414T allele
(FMO2*2A), the African American population studied exhibited a 13%
frequency of the 1414C allele (FMO2*1). The 1589insT allele occurred at
low frequencies in all populations and appeared to segregate with the
1414T allele and would thus have no further impact on FMO2 activity. By
Western blot analysis of lung microsomes, Whetstine et al. (2000) found
detectable FMO2 protein in 2 FMO2*1 heterozygotes.

Krueger et al. (2002) confirmed the presence of FMO2*1 in lung tissue
from a heterozygous (FMO2*1/FMO2*2A) individual by Western blot analysis
and confirmed activity by S-oxygenation. The microsomes also
demonstrated a heat-associated loss of activity similar to expressed
FMO2*1. This heat sensitivity may partially explain why activity in
postmortem human lung samples had been difficult to ascertain.

POPULATION GENETICS

Krueger et al. (2004) noted that the 1414C-T polymorphism exhibits
significant interethnic differences in allelic frequency. The functional
1414C allele (FMO2*1) has been found only in African American and
Hispanic populations. They stated that 26% of African Americans possess
the 1414C allele, and estimated the occurrence of FMO2*1 among Hispanics
of all origins to be between 2 and 7%.

EVOLUTION

The nonsense mutation (1441C-T; Q472X) described by Dolphin et al.
(1998) that leads to production of the truncated human protein is not
present in the FMO2 gene of closely related primates, and must therefore
have arisen in the human lineage after the divergence of humans from
their closest relative, the chimpanzee. Dolphin et al. (1998) suggested
that the truncated human FMO2 protein is unable to fold correctly and is
rapidly degraded. Heterologous expression studies demonstrated that
human FMO2*2A is catalytically inactive. Thus, this situation is similar
to those of the urate oxidase (UOX; 191540), gulonolactone oxidase
(GULOP; 240400), and cytidine monophospho-n-acetylneuraminic acid
hydroxylase (CMAH; 603209) gene products, which are active in most
mammals but are nonfunctional in the human.

300795	TITLE *300795 CANCER/TESTIS ANTIGEN FAMILY 45, MEMBER A4; CT45A4
;;CANCER/TESTIS ANTIGEN 45, MEMBER 4; CT45.4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes upregulated in testis, followed by RT-PCR and
genomic sequence analysis, Chen et al. (2005) identified 6 nearly
identical copies of the CT45 gene, designated CT45A1 through CT45A6, on
chromosome X. The CT45 genes appeared to be products of a recent gene
duplication. RT-PCR and EST analysis revealed 3 CT45 transcript variants
that differ in their 3-prime ends and represent the accumulated
expression of the CT45 genes. All 3 transcripts encode a deduced
189-amino acid protein that shares significant similarity with DDX26B,
SAGE (300359), and DDX26 (604331). RT-PCR detected high CT45 expression
in testis and variable expression in several cell lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (2005) determined that each CT45 gene contains 5 exons and
spans 8 to 9 kb. The first exon is untranslated.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chen et al. (2005) mapped the CT45 gene
cluster to a 125-kb region on chromosome Xq26.3. The 3 centromeric genes
are transcribed in the centromeric-to-telomeric direction, and the 3
telomeric genes are transcribed in the opposite direction.

603819	TITLE *603819 STEROID RECEPTOR RNA ACTIVATOR 1; SRA1
;;SRA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screening system, Lanz et al. (1999) isolated a
transcriptional coactivator of steroid nuclear receptors, termed steroid
receptor RNA activator (SRA). Northern blot analysis revealed that the
SRA gene was expressed in all human tissues tested as major transcripts
of approximately 0.7 to 0.85 kb and minor transcripts of approximately
1.3 to 1.5 kb; SRA was expressed at high levels in liver and skeletal
muscle and at a low level in brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Lanz et al. (1999) found that SRA was selective for steroid hormone
receptors and mediated transactivation via their N-terminal activation
function. The authors provided functional and mechanistic evidence that
SRA acts as an RNA transcript; transfected SRA, unlike other steroid
receptor coregulators, functioned in the presence of cycloheximide, and
SRA mutants containing multiple translational stop signals retained
their ability to activate steroid receptor-dependent gene expression.
Biochemical fractionation showed that SRA exists in distinct
ribonucleoprotein complexes, one of which contains steroid receptor
coactivator-1 (602691). Lanz et al. (1999) suggested that SRA may act to
confer functional specificity upon multiprotein complexes recruited by
liganded receptors during transcriptional activation.

By immunoprecipitation analysis, Caretti et al. (2006) found that p68
(DDX5; 180630), p72 (DDX17; 608469), and the noncoding RNA SRA
associated with MYOD (MYOD1; 159970) in MYOD-transfected HeLa cells. In
vitro and in vivo experiments identified p68, p72, and SRA as
coactivators of MYOD, and their knockdown in C2C12 mouse myoblast cells
prevented proper muscle gene expression and cell differentiation.

MAPPING

By sequence comparisons, Lanz et al. (1999) identified partial SRA
sequences isolated as HepG2 3-prime untranslated region (GenBank GENBANK
D16861), EST clones, and chromosome 5 BAC clone 319C17 (GenBank GENBANK
AC005214), providing a preliminary mapping of the SRA gene to chromosome
5.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NBPF10 is a member of the NBPF gene family, which consists of 22 genes
and pseudogenes that arose by gene duplication. NBPF genes contain
numerous low-copy repetitive elements and show high intergenic and
intragenic sequence identity in coding and noncoding regions (Vandepoele
et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to NBPF1 (610501),
Vandepoele et al. (2005) identified NBPF10. The deduced protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 416 kD. EST database analysis suggested
that NBPF10 is widely expressed in normal and tumor tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vandepoele et al. (2005) determined that the NBPF10 gene contains 86
coding exons, most of which result from internal duplication.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and FISH, Vandepoele et al. (2005) mapped
the NBPF10 gene to an NBPF gene cluster on chromosome 1q21.1.

;;MRGF;;
RAT THORACIC ARTERY PROTEIN, HOMOLOG OF; RTA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ross et al. (1990) cloned rat Mrgprf, which they called Rta. The deduced
343-amino acid protein has 7 transmembrane domains and is most closely
related to the human MAS1 oncogene (165180), with which it shares 34%
amino acid identity.

Dong et al. (2001) identified, in the mouse and human genomes, a family
of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) related to the MAS1 oncogene,
including MRGPRF, which they called MRGF. Several pseudogenes were also
identified. The predicted MRG proteins contain transmembrane,
extracellular, and cytoplasmic domains. A subset of MRGs was expressed
in specific subpopulations of sensory neurons that detect painful
stimuli. The expression patterns of these genes thus revealed an
unexpected degree of molecular diversity among nociceptive neurons. Some
MRGs could be specifically activated in heterologous cells by RFamide
neuropeptides, such as NPFF and NPAF (see 604643), which are analgesic
in vivo. The authors concluded that MRGs may regulate nociceptor
function and/or development, including the sensation or modulation of
pain.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Dong et al. (2001) mapped the MRGF gene to
chromosome 11.

613197	TITLE *613197 TRAF-TYPE ZINC FINGER DOMAIN-CONTAINING 1; TRAFD1
;;FLN29
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The innate immune system confers host defense against viral and
microbial infection, and TRAFD1 is a negative feedback regulator that
controls excessive immune responses (Sanada et al., 2008).

CLONING

Using microarray analysis to identify genes upregulated in mouse
macrophages by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), followed by RT-PCR of human
HEK293 cells and the mouse RAW macrophage line, Mashima et al. (2005)
cloned human and mouse TRAFD1, which they called FLN29. The deduced
human and mouse proteins contain 582 and 576 amino acids, respectively.
TRAFD1 has an N-terminal RING finger domain, followed by a zinc finger
domain, and TRAF-N and TRAF-C domains. Northern blot analysis of mouse
tissues showed expression skeletal muscle, brain, kidney, spleen, and
bone marrow.

GENE FUNCTION

Mashima et al. (2005) found that the expression of Fln29 was upregulated
in mouse RAW cells by LPS, IFN-beta (IFNB; 147640), and IFN-gamma (IFNG;
147570). Use of Stat1 (600555)-deficient mouse bone marrow-derived
macrophages and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed that Stat1 was
required for Fln29 upregulation by LPS and IFNB. Exogenous
overexpression of Fln29 in LPS-pretreated RAW cells resulted in the
suppression of TLR4 (603030)-mediated NF-kappa B (see 164011) and
activation of MAP kinase (see MAPK1, 176948). Small interfering
RNA-induced downregulation of Fln29 reversed these effects and increased
the production of nitrous oxide. Fln29 inhibited Toll-like receptor
(TLR) signaling by interacting directly with Traf6 (602355). Mashima et
al. (2005) concluded that FLN29 is activated by STAT1 and functions as a
negative feedback regulator of TLR signaling downstream of TRAF6.

By immunoprecipitation of transfected HEK293 cells, Sanada et al. (2008)
found that mouse Fln29 interacted with IPS1 (MAVS; 609676), TRIF
(TICAM1; 607601), TRAF1 (601711), TRAF2 (601895), and TRAF3 (601896).
Overexpression of mouse Fln29 inhibited IPS1-dependent IRF3 (603734)
activation.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the TRAFD1 gene to chromosome 12q24.13 based on an
alignment of the TRAFD1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB007447) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Sanada et al. (2008) found that Fln29 -/- mice were born at the expected
mendelian ratio and showed no gross developmental abnormalities.
However, they mounted an exaggerated response to LPS and to poly(I:C), a
synthetic double-stranded RNA that stimulates both the Toll-like
receptor and RIGI (DDX58; 609631)-like helicase (RLH) response pathways.
Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from Fln29 -/- animals, but not
wildtype animals, showed augmented LPS-induced activation of Ikk (see
CHUK, 600664) and Jnk (see MAPK8, 601158). Mutant mice were
significantly more sensitive than wildtype mice to poly(I:C)-induced
septic shock. They suffered more severe hepatic damage and showed
elevated serum Il6 (147620) levels. Finally, Fln29 -/- MEFs were more
resistant to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) cytopathic effects, with
lower virus titer than in wildtype MEFs due to reduced VSV replication.
Sanada et al. (2008) concluded that FLN29 is a negative regulator of
both TLR- and RLH-mediated innate immune responses.

605219	TITLE *605219 DIRECT IAP-BINDING PROTEIN WITH LOW pI; DIABLO
;;SECOND MITOCHONDRIA-DERIVED ACTIVATOR OF CASPASE; SMAC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Caspase activation is a key regulatory step for apoptosis. Cytochrome c
(123970) released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space triggers 1
major caspase activation cascade. Upon its release to the cytosol,
cytochrome c binds to APAF1 (602233) in the presence of dATP or ATP. The
cytochrome c/APAF1 complex then recruits procaspase-9 (CASP9; 602234),
inducing its autoactivation and leading to the activation of downstream
caspases. Proteins of the BCL2 (see 603167) and inhibitor-of-apoptosis,
or IAP (see API3; 300079), families are major regulators of the
cytochrome c/APAF1/CASP9 pathway. SMAC promotes caspase activation in
this pathway.

CLONING

Du et al. (2000) identified and purified a protein, which they termed
SMAC (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase), that promotes
caspase activation in the cytochrome c/APAF1/CASP9 pathway. By
microsequence analysis, searching an EST database, and screening a HeLa
cell cDNA library, they isolated a cDNA encoding SMAC. The predicted
SMAC polypeptide contains 239 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
detected a 1.5-kb SMAC transcript in all tissues tested, with highest
expression in adult testis, high expression in heart, liver, kidney,
spleen, prostate, and ovary, and low expression in brain, lung, thymus,
and peripheral blood leukocytes.

Cheng et al. (2011) noted that the N-terminal 55 residues serve as a
mitochondrial-targeting sequence, which is removed after the Diablo
protein is imported into mitochondria intermembrane space. They found
broad expression of DIABLO in human embryonic tissue at 17 weeks'
gestation. The highest expression was in the testis, adrenal gland, and
ears, with moderate expression in the brain, eyes, liver, kidney, lung,
and spinal cord. Low expression was seen in the spleen. In the
developing mouse cochlea, Diablo was significantly upregulated in hair
cells from E18.5 to P0, but was subsequently downregulated. The extended
distribution of Diablo at different stages of development in the mouse
inner ear and the particular enrichment in hair cells suggested that
Diablo functions in the development and homeostasis of the inner ear and
in hair cells in particular.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cheng et al. (2011) noted that the DIABLO gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

Scott (2000) mapped the DIABLO gene to chromosome 12 based on sequence
similarity between the DIABLO sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF262240) and
the chromosome 12 clone RP11-512M8 (GenBank GENBANK AC048338).

Cheng et al. (2011) noted that the DIABLO gene maps to chromosome
12q24.31.

GENE FUNCTION

Du et al. (2000) showed that SMAC promotes CASP9 activation by binding
to IAPs and removing their inhibitory activity. SMAC is normally a
mitochondrial protein, but it is released into the cytosol when cells
undergo apoptosis. Mitochondrial import and cleavage of its signal
peptide are required for SMAC to gain its apoptotic activity.
Overexpression of SMAC increases cell sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli.
SMAC was the second mitochondrial protein identified (the first being
cytochrome c) that promotes apoptosis by activating caspases.

Verhagen et al. (2000) identified the murine homolog of SMAC, which they
called DIABLO (direct IAP-binding protein with low pI). They showed that
DIABLO can bind mammalian IAP homolog A (MIHA, or API3) and can also
interact with MIHB (API1; 601712), MIHC (API2; 601721), and OpIAP, the
baculoviral IAP. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis indicated
that the N-terminally processed, IAP-interacting form of DIABLO is
concentrated in membrane fractions in healthy cells but is released into
the MIHA-containing cytosolic fractions upon ultraviolet (UV)
irradiation. Since transfection of cells with DIABLO was able to counter
the protection afforded by MIHA against UV irradiation, the authors
suggested that DIABLO may promote apoptosis by binding to IAPs and
preventing them from inhibiting caspases.

Chai et al. (2000) showed that SMAC/DIABLO promotes not only the
proteolytic activation of procaspase-3, but also the enzymatic activity
of mature caspase-3, both of which depend upon its ability to interact
physically with IAPs.

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can prevent colonic tumor
progression in both experimental animals and humans. Kohli et al. (2004)
found that NSAID-induced apoptosis in a human colorectal cancer cell
line was accompanied by release of SMAC from mitochondria into the
cytosol. When SMAC was disrupted by homologous recombination and RNA
interference, the NSAID-induced apoptosis was abrogated. SMAC release
was dependent on BAX (600040), since SMAC release was not found in BAX
knockout cells.

Burri et al. (2005) identified mouse Imp1 (IMMP1L; 612323) and Imp2
(IMMP2L; 605977) as the catalytic subunits of the mitochondrial inner
membrane peptidase (IMP) complex. Imp1 and Imp2 activated Diablo by
removing its presequence, resulting in sequestration of Diablo in the
intermembrane space prior to activation by an apoptotic signal.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Chai et al. (2000) determined the crystal structure of SMAC/DIABLO at
2.2-angstrom resolution, which revealed that it homodimerizes through an
extensive hydrophobic interface. Missense mutations inactivating this
dimeric interface significantly compromised the function of SMAC/DIABLO.
The N-terminal amino acids of SMAC/DIABLO are indispensable for its
function, and a 7-residue peptide derived from the N terminus promotes
procaspase-3 activation in vitro.

To understand the structural basis of molecular recognition between SMAC
and the IAPs, Liu et al. (2000) determined the solution structure of the
BIR3 domain of XIAP (300079) complexed with a functionally active
9-residue peptide derived from the N terminus of SMAC. Wu et al. (2000)
performed the same experiment. They found that the N-terminal 4 residues
(ala-val-pro-ile) in SMAC/DIABLO recognize a surface groove on BIR3,
with the first residue ala binding a hydrophobic pocket and making 5
hydrogen bonds to neighboring residues on BIR3. These observations
provided a structural explanation for the roles of the SMAC N terminus
as well as for the conserved N-terminal sequences in the Drosophila
proteins Hid/Grim/Reaper. In conjunction with other observations, Wu et
al. (2000) concluded that their results reveal how SMAC may relieve IAP
inhibition of caspase-9 activity. In addition to explaining a number of
biologic observations, both Liu et al. (2000) and Wu et al. (2000)
suggested that their structural analyses identified potential targets
for drug screening that may be used for the treatment of cancers that
overexpress IAPs.

XIAP interacts with caspase-9 and inhibits its activity, whereas SMAC
(also known as DIABLO) relieves this inhibition through interaction with
XIAP. Srinivasula et al. (2001) demonstrated that XIAP associates with
the active caspase-9-APAF1 holoenzyme complex through binding to the
amino terminus of the linker peptide on the small subunit of caspase-9,
which becomes exposed after proteolytic processing of procaspase-9 at
asp315. Supporting this observation, point mutations that abrogate the
proteolytic processing but not the catalytic activity of caspase-9, or
deletion of the linker peptide, prevented caspase-9 association with
XIAP and its concomitant inhibition. Srinivasula et al. (2001) noted
that the N-terminal 4 residues of caspase-9 linker peptide share
significant homology with the N-terminal tetrapeptide in mature SMAC and
in the Drosophila proteins Hid/Grim/Reaper, defining a conserved class
of IAP-binding motifs. Consistent with this finding, binding of the
caspase-9 linker peptide and SMAC to the BIR3 domain of XIAP is mutually
exclusive, suggesting that SMAC potentiates caspase-9 activity by
disrupting the interaction of the linker peptide of caspase-9 with BIR3.
Srinivasula et al. (2001) concluded that their studies reveal a
mechanism in which binding to the BIR3 domain of XIAP by 2 conserved
peptides, one from SMAC and the other from caspase-9, has opposing
effects on caspase activity and apoptosis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a large Chinese family with young-adult onset of
autosomal dominant nonsyndromic deafness-64 (DFNA64; 614152), Cheng et
al. (2011) identified a heterozygous mutation in the DIABLO gene (S126L;
605219.0001). In vitro functional expression studies in E. coli and HeLa
cells showed that the mutant protein did not increase apoptotic activity
compared to wildtype. However, transfection of HeLa cells with the
mutant protein enhanced the degradation of mutant and wildtype DIABLO
via heterodimerization. Cells expressing the mutant protein showed
increased susceptibility to calcium-induced loss of mitochondrial
potential compared to wildtype, indicating increased sensitivity to
mitochondrial stress and suggestive of mitochondrial dysfunction. A
decrease in wildtype protein did not yield similar findings, suggesting
that the existence of mutant DIABLO leads to activation of a degradation
machinery for constant clearance of aberrant proteins.

ANIMAL MODEL

Okada et al. (2002) generated Diablo-deficient mice by homologous
recombination. Western blot analysis confirmed the null mutation. The
mice were fertile and appeared grossly normal at more than 1 year of
age, and histologic analysis failed to detect any abnormalities. In
vitro analysis indicated an inhibition of procaspase-3 (CASP3; 600636)
cleavage in Diablo -/- cell lysates, but all types of Diablo -/- cells
tested responded normally to a number of apoptotic stimuli. Fas
(134637)-mediated apoptosis in liver was also normal in vivo in these
mice. The authors concluded that a redundant molecule, possibly Omi
(HTRA2; 606441), or molecules are capable of compensating for the loss
of Diablo function. Alternatively, they suggested that Diablo may only
regulate programmed cell death in specific situations or tissues not yet
identified.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 64
DIABLO, SER126LEU

In affected members of a large Chinese family with young-adult onset of
autosomal dominant nonsyndromic deafness-64 (DFNA64; 614152), Cheng et
al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 377C-T transition in exon 5 of the
DIABLO gene, resulting in a ser126-to-leu (S126L) substitution in a
highly conserved residue. The S126L mutation corresponds to a
ser71-to-leu (S71L) mutation in the mature protein. The mutation was not
found in 1,000 Chinese control chromosomes. In vitro functional
expression studies in E. coli and HeLa cells showed that the mutant
protein did not increase apoptotic activity compared to wildtype.
However, transfection of HeLa cells with the mutant protein enhanced the
degradation of mutant and wildtype DIABLO via heterodimerization. Cells
expressing the mutant protein showed increased susceptibility to
calcium-induced loss of mitochondrial potential compared to wildtype,
indicating increased sensitivity to mitochondrial stress and suggestive
of mitochondrial dysfunction. A decrease in wildtype protein did not
yield similar findings, suggesting that the existence of mutant DIABLO
leads to activation of a degradation machinery for constant clearance of
aberrant proteins.

;;DRES9;;
PYK2 N-TERMINAL DOMAIN-INTERACTING RECEPTOR 2; NIR2;;
RETINAL DEGENERATION GENE B, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, ALPHA; RDGBA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PITPNM1 belongs to a family of membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol
transfer domain-containing proteins that share homology with the
Drosophila retinal degeneration B (rdgB) protein (Ocaka et al., 2005).

CLONING

The Drosophila rdgB gene encodes a 116-kD transmembrane protein
expressed in the eye and central nervous system (CNS). Mutations in rdgB
cause light-induced retinal degeneration (Vihtelic et al., 1991). By
screening an EST database for homologs of Drosophila rdgB, followed by
probing a teratocarcinoma/neuron cDNA library, Rubboli et al. (1997)
obtained a full-length cDNA encoding human PITPNM1, which they called
DRES9. The predicted 1,242-amino acid PITPNM1 protein shares 96% and 66%
amino acid identity with mouse Pitpnm1 and Drosophila rdgB,
respectively. Northern blot analysis showed ubiquitous expression of a
4.4-kb PITPNM1 transcript, with highest levels in brain, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and heart. In situ hybridization analysis of murine
embryo tissues at various developmental stages revealed high Pitpnm1
expression in the neural retina and in the CNS.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to bovine rdgB, Chang
et al. (1997) identified partial human PITPNM1 sequences, which they
used to obtain genomic clones. The deduced 1,059-amino acid protein
shares 92% identity with mouse Pitpnm1, with highest similarity in the
N- and C-terminal regions. Northern blot analysis indicated that bovine
and mouse Pitpnm1 were expressed strongly in retina and more weakly in
brain, but not in any other tissue examined. In situ hybridization of
mouse retina detected Pitpnm1 mRNA in photoreceptors and the inner
nuclear layer. Immunocytochemistry detected Pitpnm1 in photoreceptors,
particularly in the inner segments and the outer plexiform layer, the
inner plexiform layer, and possibly the ganglion cell layer.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a brain cDNA library, Lev et al. (1999)
cloned PITPNM1, which they called NIR2, as one of a family of proteins
that interact with the tyrosine kinase PYK2 (PTK2B; 601212). The deduced
1,244-amino acid PITPNM1 protein shares structural domains with other
family members, including an N-terminal phosphatidylinositol (PI)
transfer domain, an acidic calcium-binding region, 6 transmembrane
domains, and a conserved C-terminal domain. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression of PITPNM1, with highest levels in brain,
heart, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Chang et al. (1997) demonstrated the mouse Pitpnm1 fully rescued the
rdgB-dependent retinal degeneration and abnormal electroretinogram in
flies.

Lev et al. (1999) determined that the C terminus of PITPNM1 bound PYK2.
Analysis of PITPNM1 or PYK2 immunoprecipitates of cells coexpressing
PITPNM1 and PYK2 demonstrated that both proteins were tyrosine
phosphorylated. Agonists known to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of
PYK2 also induced strong phosphorylation of PITPNM1, and both proteins
were associated in a stable complex. Chang et al. (1997) concluded that
PITPNM1 is a direct or indirect substrate for PYK2 tyrosine
phosphorylation.

Tian et al. (2002) showed that PITPNM1 contains a novel N-terminal Rho
(see RhoA; 165390)-inhibitory domain (RID) that binds to GDP-bound Rho.
Ectopic expression of the PITPNM1 RID domain caused loss of F-actin
staining and inhibited Rho-mediated stress fiber formation and
lysophosphatidic acid-induced RhoA activation. Expression of the RID
domain along with the PI transfer domain removed these effects. Blocking
of PITPNM1 function by PITPNM1 antibody injection reduced neurite
extension in neuronal cells, while PITPNM1 overexpression reduced
Rho-mediated neurite retraction.

Litvak et al. (2002) showed that PITPNM1 is essential for cytokinesis.
PITPNM1 localized to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis, and
blocking of PITPNM1 function by PITPNM1 antibody injection caused
multinucleate cell formation. Overexpression of a deletion construct
lacking the N-terminal RID and PI domains caused specific blockage of
cytokinesis. Overexpression of the RID domain of PITPNM1 caused abnormal
cytokinesis, resulting in formation of a long bridge-like structure
between putative daughter cells. Coimmunoprecipitation showed that
PITPNM1 bound to RhoA in mitotic cells, and confocal microscopy showed
the 2 proteins localized together at the cleavage furrow during cell
division.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chang et al. (1997) determined that the PITPNM1 gene contains 21 exons
and spans about 12 kb. Ocaka et al. (2005) determined that the PITPNM1
gene contains 23 exons and spans approximately 13 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Chang et al. (1997) mapped the PITPNM1 gene to chromosome
11q13.1. They mapped the mouse Pitpnm1 gene to a proximal region of

605093	TITLE *605093 SH2B ADAPTOR PROTEIN 3; SH2B3
;;LYMPHOCYTE ADAPTOR PROTEIN; LNK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

T-cell activation requires stimulation of the T-cell receptor (TCR; see
186880)-CD3 (see CD3Z; 186780) complex, followed by recruitment of an
array of intracellular signaling proteins (e.g., GRB2 (108355) and PLCG1
(172420)). Mediating the interaction between the extracellular receptors
and intracellular signaling pathways are adaptor proteins such as LAT
(602354), TRIM (604962), and LNK.

CLONING

By PCR using primers based on the rat Lnk sequence and by screening a
Jurkat cDNA library, Li et al. (2000) obtained a cDNA encoding human
SH2B3, which they called LNK. Sequence analysis predicted that the
575-amino acid LNK protein contains an N-terminal proline-rich region, a
pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain; the
PH and SH2 domains are similar to those of the APS protein. Northern
blot analysis detected low expression of a 6.8-kb LNK transcript in
various lymphoid cell lines. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed
that the majority of LNK is located in the juxtanuclear region with some
found near the plasma membrane.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SH2B3
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP stSG3591). The SH2B3 gene maps to chromosome
12q24 (Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007).

GENE FUNCTION

Immunoprecipitation analysis by Li et al. (2000) demonstrated that LNK
is phosphorylated by LCK (153390) but not by SYK (600085) and that LNK
binds to the tyrosine-phosphorylated TCR zeta chain via its SH2 domain.
Functional analysis indicated that LNK inhibits the activation of NFAT
(see 600489) in stimulated T cells.

Velazquez et al. (2002) found that cells from Lnk-deficient mice showed
an increased sensitivity to several cytokines and altered activation of
the RAS/MAPK (see 190020) pathway in response to IL3 (147740) and stem
cell factor (SCF; 184745). Lnk -/- mice exhibited extramedullary
hemopoiesis with increased numbers of CD41 (see 607759)-positive
megakaryocytes as well as erythrocytes in splenic red pulp. In normal
mice, Lnk was highly expressed in multipotent cells in bone marrow,
lymph nodes, and in nonhemopoietic tissues such as testis, brain, and
muscle, but expression was low in spleen. Velazquez et al. (2002)
concluded that Lnk regulates proliferation of several hemopoietic cell
lineages.

Using Lnk -/- mice, Bersenev et al. (2008) found that Lnk controlled
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence and self-renewal predominantly
through the thrombopoietin receptor, Mpl (159530). Lnk -/- HSCs
displayed potentiated activation of Jak2 (147796) in response to
thrombopoietin (THPO; 600044). Biochemical experiments revealed that Lnk
directly bound phosphorylated tyrosine residues in Jak2 following Thpo
stimulation. In addition, a JAK2 mutant, val617 to phe (V617F
147796.0001), which is found at a high frequency in myeloproliferative
diseases, retained the ability to bind Lnk. Bersenev et al. (2008)
concluded that LNK is a negative regulator of JAK2 in stem cells and
that THPO, MPL, JAK2, and LNK form a regulatory pathway controlling stem
cell self-renewal and quiescence.

- Somatic Mutations

In 2 (6%) of 33 unrelated patients with various myeloproliferative
neoplasms, Oh et al. (2010) identified 2 different somatic mutations in
the SH2B3 gene. A 5-bp deletion resulting in premature termination was
found in a patient with primary myelofibrosis (254450), and a
glu208-to-gln (E208Q) substitution was found in a patient with essential
thrombocythemia (187950). The deletion was predicted to result in the
absence of both the PH and SH2 domains, whereas the missense mutation
was in the PH domain. In vitro functional expression studies showed that
the truncating mutation was unable to inhibit TPO (600044)-mediated
growth, and the missense mutation resulted in partial loss of this
inhibitory activity. Both mutations were associated with increased
activation of the JAK-STAT (see, e.g., 147796) signaling pathway,
resulting in cellular proliferation. In addition, both mutations were
present in early progenitor cells (CD34+) from the hematopoietic
compartments of these patients. The findings indicated that disruption
of an inhibitor of JAK-STAT signaling can phenocopy diseases that result
from activating mutations in these tyrosine kinases.

Lasho et al. (2010) reported 2 patients with somatic mutations in the
SH2B3 gene associated with isolated erythrocytosis: E208X and A215V,
respectively. Both mutations occurred in exon 2 and affected the PH
domain. Neither patient had other features of polycythemia vera (PV;
263300). Lasho et al. (2010) suggested that SH2B3 mutations may provide
the 'missing link' for JAK2-negative erythrocytosis or PV.

ANIMAL MODEL

Takaki et al. (2000) generated Lnk-deficient mice and found that
although they had unimpaired T-cell development in thymus, pre-B and
immature B cells accumulated in enlarged spleens. In bone marrow, there
was also an increase in B-lineage cells, reflecting enhanced production
of B-cell progenitors due in part to hypersensitivity to SCF (KITLG;
184745) in the presence or absence of IL7 (146660). Western blot
analysis showed that mouse Lnk is actually a 68-kD protein.

To determine whether Lnk might act as a physiologic negative regulator
of cytokine-induced HSC expansion, Buza-Vidas et al. (2006) analyzed HSC
expansion in Lnk -/- mice. They found that Lnk -/- HSCs continued to
expand postnatally, up to 24-fold above normal by 6 months of age.
Within the stem cell compartment, this expansion was highly selective
for self-renewing long-term HSCs, which showed enhanced Thpo
responsiveness. Lnk -/- HSC expansion was dependent on Thpo, and
12-week-old Lnk -/- Thpo -/- mice had 65-fold fewer long-term HSCs than
Lnk -/- mice. Expansions in multiple myeloid, but not lymphoid,
progenitors in Lnk -/- mice also proved to be Thpo-dependent.

In a patient with primary myelofibrosis (see 254450), Oh et al. (2010)
identified a somatic 5-bp deletion in the SC2B3 gene. The deletion was
predicted to result in the absence of both the PH and SH2 domains. In

was unable to inhibit TPO (600044)-mediated growth.

gene. The mutation occurred in the PH domain. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the mutation resulted in partial loss of
the ability to inhibit TPO (600044)-mediated growth.

of the SH2B3 gene. The patient did not have other features of
polycythemia vera.

191350	TITLE *191350 DOLICHYL-PHOSPHATE N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINE PHOSPHOTRANSFERASE; DPAGT1
;;UDP-GlcNAc:DOLICHYL-PHOSPHATE N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINEPHOSPHOTRANSFERASE;;
DPAGT2;;
GlcNAc-1-P TRANSFERASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

N-linked glycosylation is initiated in all eukaryotic cells with the
synthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides in a cyclic pathway, the
dolichol cycle. DPAGT1 (EC 2.7.8.15) catalyzes the first step in the
dolichol cycle, the synthesis of
N-acetylglucosaminyl-pyrophosphoryldolichol (GlcNAc-PP-dolichol) from
dolichol phosphate and UDP-GlcNAc, and can be inhibited by the
antibiotic tunicamycin (Eckert et al., 1998).

CLONING

Rajput et al. (1992) isolated mRNA for the Dpagt1 protein from mouse
mammary glands. The mouse cDNA recognized a single mRNA species of about
2 kb in mouse mammary glands when used as a probe in Northern blot
analysis.

Eckert et al. (1998) cloned a human DPAGT1 cDNA from a human lung
fibroblast cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a deduced 400-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 44.7 kD. DPAGT1 contains an
N-terminal signal peptide, 2 potential dolichol-binding sequences, and 4
sites for N-glycosylation. It shares 93% amino acid homology with
hamster Dpagt, including 100% identity in the dolichol-binding region,
and 42% homology with S. cerevisiae GlcNAc-1-P transferase.

GENE FUNCTION

Protein asparagine-linked glycosylation is a multistep process that is
divided into 2 stages. The first stage consists of the synthesis of the
lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor (LLO) and its en bloc transfer to
nascent polypeptides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. This
process requires at least 34 genes, of which DPAGT1 is the first. The
second stage involves the processing of protein-bound oligosaccharides
and requires at least an additional 20 genes to form a bi-antennary
sugar chain typical of plasma glycoproteins. Genetic defects in some of
these genes, including DPAGT1, cause severe multisystem disorders called
congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) (Freeze, 2001)

Eckert et al. (1998) demonstrated that S. cerevisiae expressing
recombinant DPAGT1 synthesized GlcNAc- and GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol.
Expression of human DPAGT1 also complemented a conditional lethal S.
cerevisiae strain defective for GlcNAc-1-P transferase. Expression of
recombinant DPAGT1 from a multicopy expression vector also conferred a
higher tolerance toward tunicamycin due to elevated enzyme synthesis,
thus showing a gene dosage effect.

MAPPING

Using FISH and somatic cell hybrid analysis, Smith et al. (1993) mapped
the DPAGT1 gene (D11S366) to chromosome 11q23.3.

Using a panel of mouse/hamster somatic cell hybrids and a specific probe
derived from the 3-prime noncoding region of the mouse cDNA, Rajput et
al. (1992) mapped the mouse Dpagt1 gene to chromosome 17.

ANIMAL MODEL

Marek et al. (1999) found that Dpagt1-null mice died 4 to 5 days
postfertilization, just after implantation, suggesting that DPAGT1
function and protein N-glycosylation are essential in early
embryogenesis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type Ij

In a patient with CDG Ij (CDGIJ; 608093), Wu et al. (2003) identified a
tyr170-to-cys mutation (Y170C; 191350.0001) in the DPAGT1 gene.

Timal et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations
in the DPAGT1 gene (191350.0007 and 191350.0008) in a Caucasian boy with
CDG Ij. The mutations were found by exome sequencing and confirmed by
Sanger sequencing.

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Turkish parents, with severe CDG Ij,
Wurde et al. (2012) identified a homozygous mutation in the DPAGT1 gene
(A114G; 191350.0009). The mutation was found by homozygosity mapping
followed by candidate gene sequencing. The unaffected parents were
heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 100 control
alleles of the same ethnic background. RT-PCR analysis of patient cells
showed that the mutation also increased the amount of normal aberrant
splicing seen in controls, resulting in the skipping of exons 2/3 and a
truncated protein. In vitro functional expression assays showed
decreased DPAGT1 activity, at 18% of normal values. The patients had a
severe disorder characterized by hyperexcitability, intractable
seizures, bilateral cataracts, nystagmus, strabismus, and progressive
microcephaly. Both died within their first year of life from
cardiorespiratory failure.

In a Pakistani brother and sister, born of unrelated patients with a
mild from of CDG Ij, Iqbal et al. (2013) identified compound
heterozygous mutations in the DPAGT1 gene (I29F; 191350.0010 and L168P;
191350.0011). The mutations were found by exome sequencing, confirmed by
Sanger sequencing, segregated with the disorder, and occurred at highly
conserved residues. Neither was present in over 200 ethnically matched
chromosomes, or in the dbSNP, 1000 Genomes, or Exome Variant Server
databases. Functional studies of the variants were not performed. The
patients had normal psychomotor development until ages 2 and 5 years,
respectively, when they both developed seizures, hypotonia, and
aggressive behavior. As adults, they had moderate intellectual
disability, poor speech, aggressive behavior, hypotonia, seizures, and
mild facial dysmorphic features.

- Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome With Tubular Aggregates 2

In 5 patients from 4 families with limb-girdle congenital myasthenic
syndrome with tubular aggregates-2 (CMSTA2; 614750), Belaya et al.
(2012) identified 7 different mutations in the DPAGT1 gene (see, e.g.,
191350.0002-191350.0006). All mutations were in the compound
heterozygous state. The first 4 mutations were identified by exome
sequencing of 2 unrelated patients and were confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. The mutations segregated with the disorder in those families
with available material. Analyses of motor endplates from 2 patients
showed a severe reduction of endplate acetylcholine receptors (AChR). In
vitro studies showed that DPAGT1 is required for efficient glycosylation
of AChR subunits and for efficient export of AChR receptors to the cell
surface. The findings demonstrated the importance of N-linked protein
glycosylation for proper functioning of the neuromuscular junction, and
suggested that the primary pathogenic mechanism of DPAGT1 mutations is
reduced levels of AChR at the endplate region. Laboratory studies of 2
patients showed abnormal glycosylation of transferrin, consistent with a
functional defect of DPAGT1. Belaya et al. (2012) postulated that the
defect in glycosylation of certain proteins may lead to misfolding and
aggregation in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in formation of
tubular aggregates within muscle tissue.

NOMENCLATURE

GPT has been used as an abbreviation for this enzyme, but this runs the
risk of confusion with glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT; 138200).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CONGENITAL DISORDER OF GLYCOSYLATION, TYPE Ij
DPAGT1, TYR170CYS

In a patient with CDG Ij (CDG1J, 608093), Wu et al. (2003) identified
reduced DPAGT1 enzymatic activity; sequencing of genomic DNA and cDNAs
of the DPAGT1 gene identified, in the paternal allele, a 660A-G
transition in exon 5, resulting in a tyr170-to-cys (Y170C) mutation.
Although no mutation was identified in the maternal allele, it produced
only 12% of the normal amount of mature mRNA; the remainder showed a
complex exon skipping pattern that shifted the reading frame and
resulted in a truncated nonfunctional protein. The patient had developed
infantile spasms at the age of 4 months within 72 hours of receiving DPT
immunization. Development was significantly delayed in all aspects with
microcephaly, arched palate, micrognathia, and exotropia. She also had
fifth finger clinodactyly, single flexion creases of the hands, and skin
dimples on the upper thighs. She had severe hypotonia and medically
intractable seizures, and at 6 years of age had minimal speech. Abnormal
isoelectric focusing pattern of serum transferrin was consistent with
the diagnosis of type I CDG.

.0002
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, WITH TUBULAR AGGREGATES 2
DPAGT1, VAL117ILE

In a patient with congenital myasthenic syndrome with tubular
aggregates-2 (CMSTA2; 614750), Belaya et al. (2012) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the DPAGT1 gene: a 349G-A transition
resulting in a val117-to-ile (V117I) substitution, and a 324G-C
transversion resulting in a met108-to-ile (M108I; 191350.0003)
substitution. Another patient was compound heterozygous for V117I and a
1-bp duplication (699dup; 191350.0004), resulting in a frameshift,
premature termination (Thr234HisfsTer116), and nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay. The mutations were found by exome sequencing and confirmed by
Sanger sequencing. The 324G-C mutation was found in 2 (0.0186%) of
10,758 control alleles from the general population and 1 (0.0142%) of
7,020 alleles in the European American population. None of the other
mutations were found in controls. The patients had onset at age 2.5 and
7 years, respectively, of difficulty walking due to proximal muscle
weakness, and showed a favorable response to pyridostigmine. Muscle
biopsy showed reduced levels of endplate acetylcholine receptors (AChR).
In vitro functional expression studies showed that the 699dup mutation
was unable to restore normal levels of glycosylated AChR in HEK293 cells
with DPAGT1 inhibition.

mutations in the DPAGT1 gene: a 358C-A transversion resulting in a
leu120-to-met (L120M) substitution, and a 791T-G transversion resulting
in a val264-to-gly (V264G; 191350.0006) substitution. The patients had
onset in the first year of life of hypotonia, poor head control, and
delayed motor development. They showed some improvement in muscle power
during the teenage years, and both showed a response to pyridostigmine.

compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the DPAGT1 gene: a 206T-A
transversion in exon 2 resulting in an ile69-to-asn (I69N) substitution
at a highly conserved residue in the highly conserved dolichol
recognition motif, and a G-to-A transition in intron 1 (161+5G-A)
(191350.0008), which resulted in degradation of the mutant mRNA. The
mutations were found by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1 of the
mutations. In patient-derived cells, the formation of GlcNAc-PP-dolichol
was reduced to 22% of controls. The patient had multisystem problems,
including asphyxia at birth, respiratory insufficiency, frequent apneas,
jaundice, nuclear cataracts, cryptorchidism, dysmorphic features,
hypertonia of the limbs, joint contractures, tremor, and feeding
difficulties. Laboratory studies showed chronic anemia, hypoproteinemia,
increased liver enzymes, and coagulation defects.

Wurde et al. (2012) identified a homozygous c.341C-G transversion in
exon 3 of the DPAGT1 gene, resulting in an ala114-to-gly (A114G)
substitution. The mutation was found by homozygosity mapping followed by
candidate gene sequencing. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for
the mutation, which was not found in 100 control alleles of the same
ethnic background. RT-PCR of patient cells showed that the mutation also
increased the normal aberrant splicing seen in controls, resulting in

DPAGT1, ILE29PHE

In 2 Pakistani sibs, born of unrelated parents, with a relatively mild
form of CDH Ij (608093), Iqbal et al. (2013) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the DPAGT1 gene: a c.85A-T transition
resulting in an ile29-to-phe (I29F) substitution, and a c.503T-C
transition resulting in a leu168-to-pro (L168P; 191350.0011)
substitution. The mutations were found by exome sequencing of 1 of the
patients and confirmed by Sanger sequencing in both patients. The
mutations segregated with the disorder and occurred at highly conserved
residues. Neither was present in over 200 ethnically matched chromosomes
or in the dbSNP, 1000 Genomes, or Exome Variant Server databases.
Functional studies of the variants were not performed.

179590	TITLE *179590 PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, RECEPTOR-TYPE, F; PTPRF
;;RECEPTOR-LINKED PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE LAR;;
LEUKOCYTE ANTIGEN-RELATED TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE; LAR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The LAR (PTPRF) gene encodes a membrane protein that has a cytoplasmic
domain with homology to protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (176885) and an
extracellular domain homologous to the neural cellular adhesion molecule
NCAM (116930).

CLONING

The human LAR molecule closely resembles cell adhesion molecules, which
suggests that it may be involved in the regulation of phosphotyrosine
levels through cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. As a first step
toward site-directed mutagenesis studies of LAR function, Schaapveld et
al. (1995) characterized the mouse Ptprf gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schaapveld et al. (1995) found that the cytoplasmic region of the mouse
Ptprf gene is encoded by 11 exons that span only 4.5 kb of genomic DNA.
Compared to the known exon-intron structures of other mammalian
receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase genes such as Ptpra (encoding
LRP; 176884) and Ptprc (coding for Ly-5; 151460), the portion of the
Ptprf gene encoding the cytoplasmic region of murine LAR contained not
only smaller, but also fewer introns.

O'Grady et al. (1994) demonstrated that the human LAR gene is composed
of 33 exons spanning over 85 kb. Exon 2 encodes the signal sequence and
the first 4 amino acids in the mature LAR protein. The 3
immunoglobulin-like domains are encoded by exons 3 to 7, and the 8
fibronectin type III (FN-III) domains by exons 8 to 17. Exons 18 to 22
encode the juxtamembrane and transmembrane domains, and exons 23 to 33
encode the 2 conserved tyrosine phosphatase domains and the entire
3-prime untranslated region. Alternative splicing of LAR mRNA was
revealed by RT-PCR analysis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Ahmad and Goldstein (1997) reported that LAR is synthesized as an
approximately 200-kD protein that is proteolytically processed into 2
noncovalently associated subunits: a 150-kD extracellular (E) subunit
that contains the cell adhesion molecule domains, and an 85-kD
phosphatase (P) subunit that contains extracellular, transmembrane, and
cytoplasmic domains. Ahmad and Goldstein (1997) carried out several
studies to elucidate the relationship between LAR and the insulin
signaling pathway. They demonstrated that anti-LAR antibodies inhibit
the activity of overexpressed human insulin receptor (147670) in Chinese
hamster ovary cells. Immunoprecipitation of LAR from cell lysates and
immunoblotting with antibody to the insulin receptor (or vice versa)
showed a physical association between LAR and the insulin receptor. In
insulin-stimulated rat liver cells, LAR was temporally internalized into
a similar endosomal compartment as the insulin receptor. Ahmad and
Goldstein (1997) concluded that LAR acts as a protein-tyrosine
phosphatase that negatively regulates the insulin signaling pathway.

Nam et al. (1999) determined the crystal structure of the tandem D1 and
D2 domains of the human LAR.

Most receptor-like transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases)
such as CD45 and the PTPRF molecule have 2 tandemly repeated PTPase
domains in the cytoplasmic segment. Tsujikawa et al. (2001) examined the
function of each PTPase domain of PTPRF in vivo using a potential
physiologic substrate, insulin receptor, and PTPRF mutant proteins.
PTPRF associated with and preferentially dephosphorylated the insulin
receptor that was tyrosine phosphorylated by insulin stimulation. Its
association was mediated by PTPase domain 2, because the cys1813-to-ser
mutation in domain 2 resulted in weakening of the association. The
cys1522-to-ser mutant protein, which is defective in the PTPRF PTPase
domain 1 catalytic site, was tightly associated with
tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor, but failed to dephosphorylate
it, indicating that PTPRF PTPase domain 1 is critical for
dephosphorylation of tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor. The
authors concluded that each domain of PTPRF plays distinct functional
roles through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in vivo.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Disteche et al. (1989) mapped the LAR gene to
1p34-p32. The related leukocyte common antigen (LCA, also known as CD45;
151460) also maps to chromosome 1. By in situ hybridization, Jirik et
al. (1992) mapped LAR, a putative tumor suppressor gene, to 1p32, a
region frequently deleted in human neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma.
By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Schaapveld et al. (1995) mapped
the Ptprf gene to mouse chromosome 4. Harder et al. (1995) found that
coamplification of the PTPRF gene and the MYCL1 gene (164850) in a small
cell lung cancer line supported close linkage of the 2 genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wang et al. (2004) performed mutation analysis of the tyrosine
phosphatase gene superfamily in human cancers and identified 83 somatic
mutations in 6 protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPRF; PTPRG, 176886;
PTPRT, 608712; PTPN3, 176877; PTPN13, 600267; and PTPN14, 603155),
affecting 26% of colorectal cancers and a smaller fraction of lung,
breast, and gastric cancers. Fifteen mutations were nonsense,
frameshift, or splice site alterations predicted to result in truncated
proteins lacking phosphatase activity. Wang et al. (2004) biochemically
examined 5 missense mutations in PTPRT, the most commonly altered
protein-tyrosine phosphatase, and found that they reduced phosphatase
activity. Expression of wildtype but not a mutant PTPRT in human cancer
cells inhibited cell growth. Wang et al. (2004) concluded that their
observations suggested that the mutated tyrosine phosphatases are tumor
suppressor genes, regulating cellular pathways that may be amenable to
therapeutic intervention.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schaapveld et al. (1997) used gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem
cells to generate mice lacking sequences encoding both Lar phosphatase
domains. Homozygous mutant mice developed and grew normally. However,
mammary glands of homozygous Lar-deficient females were incapable of
delivering milk due to an impaired terminal differentiation of alveoli
at late pregnancy. The authors concluded that LAR-mediated signaling may
play an important role in mammary gland development and function.

Uetani et al. (2009) obtained late Ptprs (601576)/Ptprf double-knockout
mouse embryos at the expected mendelian ratio, but none survived to 4
weeks of age, likely due to lethality of Ptprs knockout. At embryonic
day 18.5, double-knockout embryos showed severe craniofacial defects,
including exencephaly, micrognathia, and failure of eyelid closure.
Additional malformation of the eye included hyperplastic inner nuclear
layers, persistence of prominent hyaloid arteries, abnormal retrolental
tissues, and disorganized neural retina. Double-knockout embryos also
showed striking abnormalities of the urinary tract, such as
hydroureters, hydronephrosis, duplicated ureter/renal systems, and
ureterocele. Absence of Ptprs and Ptprf activity prevented normal
execution of the apoptotic program necessary for regression of the
common nephric duct during development, resulting in inappropriate
tissue survival and delayed distal ureter maturation. In cell culture,
Ptprs bound and negatively regulated the phosphorylation and signaling
of the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase (164761), whereas Ptprs-induced
apoptosis was inhibited by Ret expression. Uetani et al. (2009)
concluded that ureter positioning is controlled by the opposing actions
of RET and LAR family phosphatases regulating apoptosis-mediated tissue
morphogenesis.

605232	TITLE *605232 PROTEIN KINASE, LYSINE-DEFICIENT 1; WNK1
;;PROSTATE-DERIVED STERILE 20-LIKE KINASE; PSK;;
PRKWNK1;;
KDP;;
KIAA0344
WNK1/HSN2 ISOFORM, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nagase et al. (1997) cloned a WNK1 cDNA, which they called KIAA0344. The
deduced protein contains 1,246 amino acids. RT-PCR detected highest
expression in kidney.

Using degenerate PCR against conserved kinase catalytic subdomains,
Moore et al. (2000) cloned human WNK1, which they called PSK. PSK
belongs to the STE20 family of serine-threonine kinases. The PSK protein
contains 1,235 amino acids and has an N-terminal kinase domain. PSK was
ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined by Northern blot
analysis, with strongest expression in testis.

Xu et al. (2000) isolated a full-length rat cDNA encoding Wnk1 and
identified homologs in various species, including partial human
sequences. The N-terminal half of the deduced 2,126-amino acid rat
protein has a proline-rich region, followed by a serine/threonine kinase
domain and coiled-coil region, and the C-terminal half has a
proline-rich region and coiled-coil region. Wnk1 contains a cysteine
instead of the usual lysine at a key position in its active site.
Immunoblot analysis detected an endogenous 230-kD protein in rat brain
and several mammalian cell lines, including human embryonic kidney
(HEK293) cells. Most endogenous WNK1 protein was found in the
particulate fraction of HEK293 cells, suggesting that WNK1 is associated
with membranes or the cytoskeleton. Immunofluorescence analysis of
HEK293 cells transfected with rat Wnk1 revealed cytoplasmic staining.

Wilson et al. (2001) noted that the deduced human and rat WNK1 proteins
share 86% identity. By Northern blot analysis, they observed expression
of human WNK1 in most tissues, with 2 predominant isoforms: a 10-kb
transcript expressed at high levels in the kidney, and a 12-kb
transcript predominant in heart and skeletal muscle. By
immunofluorescence microscopy, Wilson et al. (2001) demonstrated that
WNK1 localizes to the distal convoluted tubule and the cortical
collecting duct, and is also abundant in the medullary collecting duct.

Choate et al. (2003) examined the distribution of WNK1 in extrarenal
tissues. Immunostaining using WNK1-specific antibodies demonstrated that
WNK1 was not present in all cell types; rather, it was predominantly
localized in polarized epithelia, including those lining the lumen of
the hepatic biliary ducts, pancreatic ducts, epididymis, sweat ducts,
colonic crypts, and gallbladder. WNK1 was also found in the basal layers
of epidermis and throughout the esophageal epithelium. Subcellular
localization of WNK1 varied among these epithelia. WNK1 was cytoplasmic
in kidney, colon, gallbladder, sweat duct, skin, and esophagus. In
contrast, it localized to the lateral membrane in bile ducts, pancreatic
ducts, and epididymis. These epithelia are all notable for their
prominent role in chloride-iron flux.

Using primer extension with human leukocyte and kidney RNA, 5-prime RACE
of human heart and kidney cDNA libraries, and RT-PCR of human heart,
skeletal muscle, and kidney RNA, Delaloy et al. (2003) characterized
several WNK1 variants resulting from tissue-specific splicing and the
use of multiple transcriptional start sites and polyadenylation sites.
Two promoters in exon 1 generate 2 ubiquitously expressed WNK1 isoforms
with complete kinase domains. A third promoter in exon 4A generates a
kidney-specific transcript that encodes an N-terminally truncated
protein that is kinase defective. Exon 4A is highly conserved between
human and rodents and encodes a cysteine-rich region. Northern blot
analysis detected a 9-kb transcript expressed predominantly in human
kidney and a 10.5-kb transcript expressed predominantly in skeletal
muscle, heart, and brain. Qualitative RT-PCR detected 10 times more
kinase-defective transcript than kinase domain-containing transcript in
human kidney mRNA. In situ hybridization of adult mouse kidney using an
exon 4A-specific probe revealed expression in kidney cortex,
predominantly in distal convoluted tubules.

- WNK1/HSN2 Isoform

Lafreniere et al. (2004) identified a novel gene, which they designated
HSN2, within the hereditary sensory neuropathy type II (HSAN2; 201300)
critical region on 12p13.33. The HSN2 gene encodes a deduced 434-amino
acid protein. Northern blot analysis of adult human tissues failed to
detect HSN2 transcripts, suggesting that the gene might be expressed at
very low levels. Lafreniere et al. (2004) suggested that the HSN2
protein may play a role in the development and/or maintenance of
peripheral sensory neurons or their supporting Schwann cells.

By Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis using mouse Wnk1, Shekarabi et al.
(2008) concluded that HSN2 is an alternatively spliced exon of WNK1 and
is part of a nervous system-specific isoform of WNK1, which they called
WNK1/HSN2. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues showed a 10-kb
transcript exclusively expressed in nervous system tissues, including
the spinal cord, brain, and dorsal root ganglia. RT-PCR analysis
demonstrated that the Wnk1/Hsn2 isoform includes either the Hsn2 exon
alone or Hsn2 along with a novel exon 8B and lacks exons 11 and 12.
Immunohistochemical studies confirmed localization of the Wnk1/Hsn2
isoform to mouse nervous system tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wilson et al. (2001) determined that the WNK1 gene contains 28 exons
that span 156 kb of genomic DNA.

Delaloy et al. (2003) identified 2 promoters in exon 1 of the WNK1 gene,
including 1 within the coding region, that generate ubiquitously
expressed WNK1 transcripts. A third promoter, located in the alternative
exon 4A within intron 4, generates a kidney-specific transcript. The
promoters lack TATA boxes, are GC-rich, and contain several
transcription factor-binding sites. A repressor element is present in
the most 5-prime promoter in exon 1. In addition, WNK1 has multiple
transcription start sites in exon 1 and 2 polyadenylation sites at its
3-prime end.

- WNK1/HSN2 Isoform

Lafreniere et al. (2004) determined that the HSN2 gene consists of a
single exon that is located within intron 8 of the WNK1 gene and
transcribed from the same strand. The authors initially concluded that
the WNK1 and HSN2 genes were differentially regulated. Subsequently,
Shekarabi et al. (2008) determined that HSN2 is a nervous-system
specific exon of the WNK1 gene, and they identified a novel exon 8B.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid panel, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the
WNK1 gene to chromosome 12.

GENE FUNCTION

Moore et al. (2000) found that immunoprecipitated PSK phosphorylated
myelin basic protein (159430) and transfected PSK-stimulated MKK4
(601335) and MKK7 (603014), and activated the c-Jun N-terminal kinase
(JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (see 603014).
Microinjection of PSK into cells resulted in localization of PSK to a
vesicular compartment and caused a marked reduction in actin stress
fibers. In contrast, C-terminally truncated PSK did not localize to this
compartment or induce a decrease in stress fibers, demonstrating a
requirement for the C terminus. Kinase-defective PSK, carrying a
lys57-to-ala (K57A) mutation, was unable to reduce stress fibers.

Xu et al. (2002) expressed fragments of rat Wnk1 in bacteria and
identified an autoinhibitory region just C-terminal to the kinase
domain. The isolated autoinhibitory domain, which is conserved in all 4
human WNKs, suppressed the activity of the Wnk1 kinase domain. Mutation
of 2 conserved phenylalanines in the autoinhibitory domain (phe524 and
phe526 in rat Wnk1) attenuated its ability to inhibit Wnk1 kinase
activity, and the same mutations in a Wnk1 fragment containing the
autoinhibitory domain increased its kinase activity. Wnk1 expressed in
bacteria was autophosphorylated, and autophosphorylation of ser382 in
the activation loop was required for its activity.

Yang et al. (2003) found that mouse Wnk4 (601844) reduced the plasma
membrane association of the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride
cotransporter (NCC, or SLC12A3; 600968) in injected Xenopus oocytes.
They further demonstrated that Wnk1 did not affect Slc12a3-mediated
sodium uptake in oocytes, but coexpression of Wnk1 with both Wnk4 and
Slc12a3 restored sodium uptake to levels observed in oocytes expressing
Slc12a3 alone.

To investigate the mechanisms by which WNK1 and WNK4 interact to
regulate ion transport, Yang et al. (2005) performed experiments in
HEK293 cells and Xenopus oocytes which showed that the WNK4 C terminus
mediates SLC12A3 suppression, that the WNK1 kinase domain interacts with
the WNK4 kinase domain, and that WNK1 inhibition of WNK4 is dependent on
WNK1 catalytic activity and an intact WNK1 protein.

Yang et al. (2007) noted that WNK1, WNK4, and the kidney-specific WNK1
isoform interact to regulate SLC12A3 activity, suggesting that WNKs form
a signaling complex. They found that human WNK3 (300358), which is
expressed by distal tubule cells, interacted with rodent Wnk1 and Wnk4
to regulate SLC12A3 in cultured kidney cells and Xenopus oocytes.
Regulation of SLC12A3 in oocytes resulted from antagonism between WNK3
and Wnk4.

Lee et al. (2004) found that rat Wnk1 selectively bound to and
phosphorylated synaptotagmin-2 (SYT2; 600104) calcium-binding C2
domains. Endogenous Wnk1 and Syt2 coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized
on a subset of secretory granules in a rat insulinoma cell line.
Phosphorylation by Wnk1 increased the amount of Ca(2+) required for Syt2
binding to phospholipid vesicles. Lee et al. (2004) concluded that
phosphorylation of SYT2 by WNK1 can regulate Ca(2+) sensing and the
subsequent Ca(2+)-dependent interactions mediated by synaptotagmin C2
domains.

Lenertz et al. (2005) found that hypertonic stress activated rat Wnk1
when it was expressed in kidney epithelial cells and breast and colon
cancer cell lines. Hypotonic stress led to a modest increase in Wnk1
activity. Gel filtration suggested that Wnk1 exists as a tetramer, and
yeast 2-hybrid analysis revealed interaction between residues 1 to 222
of the Wnk1 N terminus and Wnk1 residues 481 to 660, which contain the
autoinhibitory domain and a coiled-coil region. Lenertz et al. (2005)
found no direct interaction between Wnk1 and Wnk4, but Wnk1
phosphorylated both Wnk2 (606249) and Wnk4, and the Wnk1 autoinhibitory
domain inhibited the catalytic activities of Wnk2 and Wnk4.

Using Xenopus oocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells, Xu et al. (2005)
showed that WNK1 controls ion permeability by activating SGK1 (602958),
leading to activation of the epithelial sodium channel (see SCNN1A;
600228). Increased WNK1-induced channel activity depended on SGK1 and
the E3 ubiquitin ligase, NEDD4-2 (NEDD4L; 606384).

Alternative splicing of WNK1 produces a kidney-specific short form that
lacks a kinase domain, KS-WNK1, and a more ubiquitous long form, L-WNK1.
Using reconstitution studies in Xenopus oocytes, Wade et al. (2006)
found that rat L-Wnk1 inhibited the K+ channel Kir1.1 (KCNJ1; 600359) by
reducing its cell surface localization, and this inhibition required an
intact kinase domain. Ks-Wnk1 did not directly alter Kir1.1 channel
activity, but it acted as a dominant-negative inhibitor of L-Wnk1 and
released Kir1.1 from inhibition. Acute dietary potassium loading in rats
increased the relative abundance of Ks-Wnk1 to L-Wnk1 transcript and
protein in kidney, indicating that physiologic upregulation of Kir1.1
activity involves a WNK1 isoform switch.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of Jurkat human T cells and
immunoprecipitation analysis of human embryonic kidney cells and HeLa
cells, Anselmo et al. (2006) showed that OSR1 (OXSR1; 604046) and WNK1
interacted through conserved C-terminal motifs. OSR1 was phosphorylated
in a WNK1-dependent manner, and depletion of WNK1 from HeLa cells with
small interfering RNA reduced OSR1 kinase activity. Depletion of either
WNK1 or OSR1 reduced Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC; see 600839) activity,
suggesting that WNK1 and OSR1 are required for NKCC function.

He et al. (2007) showed that mammalian Wnk1 and Wnk4 interacted with the
endocytic scaffold protein intersectin-1 (ITSN1; 602442) and that these
interactions were crucial for stimulation of Romk1 (KCNJ1) endocytosis.
Stimulation of Romk1 endocytosis by Wnk1 and Wnk4 required their
proline-rich motifs, but it did not require their kinase activities.
Pseudohypoaldosteronism II (145260)-causing mutations in Wnk4 enhanced
the interactions of Wnk4 with Itsn1 and Romk1, leading to increased
endocytosis of Romk1.

Yang et al. (2007) showed that coexpression of rodent Wnk1 and Wnk4 with
human CFTR (602421) suppressed CFTR-dependent chloride channel activity
in Xenopus oocytes. The effect of Wnk4 was dose dependent, independent
of Wnk4 kinase activity, and occurred, at least in part, by reducing
CFTR protein abundance at the plasma membrane. In contrast, the effect
of Wnk1 on CFTR activity required Wnk1 kinase activity. Moreover, Wnk1
and Wnk4 exhibited additive CFTR inhibition.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Pseudohypoaldosteronism Type IIC

Wilson et al. (2001) identified WNK1 as the gene mutant in one form of
pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHA2C; 614492), an autosomal dominant
disorder characterized by hypertension, hyperkalemia, and renal tubular
acidosis. In a 10-member kindred segregating PHAII, they identified a
41-kb deletion in intron 1 of WNK1 (605232.0001). In the family
previously described by Disse-Nicodeme et al. (2000), they identified a
22-kb deletion within intron 1 of WNK1 (605232.0002). Wilson et al.
(2001) found that affected individuals carrying the 22-kb deletion had a
5-fold increase in the level of WNK1 transcripts in leukocytes relative
to those of their unaffected relatives, thus demonstrating that the
deletion alters WNK1 expression.

- Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy II

Among from 5 families with HSAN2, including 2 from Newfoundland, 2 from
rural Quebec, and 2 from Nova Scotia, Lafreniere et al. (2004)
identified 3 different truncating mutations in the WNK1 gene (594delA,
605232.0003; 918insA, 605232.0004; Q315X, 605232.0005).

Roddier et al. (2005) identified 2 founder mutations in the WNK1 gene
(918insA and Q315X) that were responsible for HSAN2 in the southern part
of Quebec.

Coen et al. (2006) reported 3 unrelated patients with HSAN2 from Italy,
Austria, and Belgium, respectively. All had compound heterozygous or
homozygous truncating mutations in the WNK1 gene, resulting in complete
loss of protein function. All patients had early onset of a severe
sensory neuropathy with mutilating acropathy but without autonomic
dysfunction. Muscle strength was preserved.

- Hypokalemic Salt-Losing Renal Tubulopathy

Zhang et al. (2013) studied 44 Chinese patients with hypokalemia of
unknown cause, metabolic alkalosis, and normal to low blood pressure. In
33 patients, they identified homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for
known mutations in the CLCNKB (602023) or SLC12A3 (600968) genes,
associated with forms of Bartter syndrome (see 607364) and Gitelman
syndrome (263800), respectively. Of the 11 remaining patients, 8 were
heterozygous for a mutation in the SLC12A3 gene, whereas in 3, no
mutation was detected in either gene. Screening for mutations in the
candidate genes WNK1 and WNK4 (601844) revealed heterozygosity for 2
missense mutations in WNK1 (605232.0012 and 605232.0013, respectively)
in 2 of the 11 patients, both of whom were also heterozygous for a known
mutation in SLC12A3, each of which had previously been reported in a
patient diagnosed with Gitelman syndrome (Simon et al., 1996 and Shao et
al., 2008, respectively). No mutations were detected in WNK4. Zhang et
al. (2013) suggested that inactivating mutations in WNK1 may cause
salt-losing renal tubulopathy, which represents a phenotype that is the
converse of PHAII, caused by WNK1 gain-of-function mutations.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

In a girl with HSAN2, Shekarabi et al. (2008) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the WNK1 gene: 1 in the WNK1/HSN2
isoform (605232.0010) and 1 in the WNK1 isoform (605232.0011). She did
not have hypertension. The authors noted that all recessive mutations
associated with the HSAN2 phenotype resulted in truncations of the
WNK1/HSN2 nervous system-specific protein. Disease-causing mutations in
WNK1 resulting in PHA2C were large, heterozygous intronic deletions that
increase the gene expression. This impact on the expression level in
PHA2C patients may explain the absence of hypertension in individuals
affected with HSAN2, as the expression of the WNK1 isoform in which the
HSN2 exon is not incorporated should not be affected. The findings in
their patient suggested that 1 mutation in the HSN2 exon is sufficient
to cause the HSAN2 phenotype when combined with a mutation in WNK1 on
the other allele. Moreover, homozygous mutations disrupting WNK1
isoforms without HSN2 may be lethal, which would explain why all
loss-of-function mutations reported to date have been located in the
HSN2 exon.

ANIMAL MODEL

To accelerate the genetic determination of gene function, Zambrowicz et
al. (2003) developed a sequence-tagged gene-trap library of more than
270,000 mouse embryonic stem cell clones representing mutations in
approximately 60% of mammalian genes. Through the generation and
phenotypic analysis of knockout mice from this resource, they undertook
a functional screen to identify genes regulating physiologic parameters
such as blood pressure. As part of this screen, mice deficient for the
Wnk1 gene were generated and analyzed. Genetic studies in humans had
shown that large intronic deletions in WNK1 lead to its overexpression
and are responsible for pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (Wilson et al.,
2001), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hypertension,
increased renal salt reabsorption, and impaired potassium and hydrogen
excretion. Consistent with the human genetic studies, Wnk1 heterozygous
mice displayed a significant decrease in blood pressure. Mice homozygous
for the Wnk1 mutation died during embryonic development before day 13 of
gestation. Zambrowicz et al. (2003) concluded that WNK1 is a regulator
of blood pressure critical for development and illustrated the utility
of a functional screen driven by a sequence-based mutagenesis approach.

WNK1, 41-KB DEL, IVS1

In a family with pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHA2C; 614492), Wilson

In a family with pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHA2C; 614492)
reported by Disse-Nicodeme et al. (2000), Wilson et al. (2001)

WNK1, 1-BP DEL, 594A

In affected members of 2 Newfoundland families with hereditary sensory
neuropathy type II (201300), 1 of which was consanguineous, Lafreniere
et al. (2004) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion in the HSN2 exon of
the WNK1 gene, 594delA, resulting in a frameshift at codon 198 with a
premature termination and a truncated 206-amino acid peptide. Numbering
of this mutation is based on the HSN exon ORF only.

.0004

WNK1, 1-BP INS, 918A

In 2 sisters from Nova Scotia, born to consanguineous parents, with
hereditary sensory neuropathy type II (201300), Lafreniere et al. (2004)
found homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion in the HSN2 exon of the WNK1
gene, 918insA, resulting in a frameshift at codon 307 with a premature
termination and a truncated 318-amino acid peptide. In 2 French Canadian
sisters with HSAN2, the 918insA mutation was in compound heterozygous
state with the Q315X mutation (605232.0005). Numbering of this mutation
is based on the HSN exon ORF only.

Roddier et al. (2005) identified the 918insA mutation in 7 (58%) of 12
HSAN2 patients from the Lanaudiere region of southern Quebec, suggesting
a founder effect. One patient was homozygous, and 6 were compound
heterozygous with the Q315X mutation. Regional carrier frequency of the
918insA mutation was estimated to range from 1 in 260 to 1 in 28.

.0005
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE II
WNK1, GLN315TER

In a French Canadian patient with hereditary sensory neuropathy type II
(201300), Lafreniere et al. (2004) found homozygosity for a 943C-T
transition in the HSN2 exon of the WNK1 gene, resulting in a
gln315-to-ter substitution (Q315X) predicted to truncate the protein to
314 amino acids. In 2 French Canadian sisters with HSAN2, the Q315X
mutation was found in compound heterozygous state with the 918insA
mutation (605343.0004) in the HSN2 exon. Numbering of this mutation is
based on the HSN exon ORF only.

In affected members of families with HSAN2 (201300) from the the
southern part of Quebec, Roddier et al. (2005) identified the Q315X
mutation. Nine (56%) of 16 patients were homozygous for the mutation,
and 6 (38%) of 16 patients were compound heterozygous with the 918insA
mutation. Most of the patients were from the Lanaudiere region. Regional
carrier frequency of the Q315X mutation was estimated to range from 1 in
116 to 1 in 18.

WNK1, 1-BP DEL, 947C

In 4 affected members of a large consanguineous Lebanese family with
hereditary sensory neuropathy type II (201300), Riviere et al. (2004)
identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (947delC) in the HSN2 exon of the
WNK1 gene, resulting in the loss of 117 amino acids from the protein.
Numbering of this mutation is based on the HSN exon ORF only.

.0007
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE II
WNK1, ARG290TER

In a 13-year-old Canadian child of Lebanese origin with HSAN2 (201300),
Roddier et al. (2005) identified a homozygous 868C-T transition in the
HSN2 exon of the WNK1 gene, resulting in an arg290-to-ter (R290X)
substitution. The authors noted that this mutation differed from that
reported in another Lebanese family (605232.0006).

.0008
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE II
WNK1, 1-BP INS, 1134T

In a 28-year-old Korean man with HSAN2 (201300), Cho et al. (2006)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the HSN2 exon of
the WNK1 gene: a 1-bp insertion (1134insT) and a 217C-T transition,
resulting in a gln73-to-ter (Q73X; 605232.0009) substitution. The
patient had childhood onset of the disorder and amputation of both lower
limbs and several fingers due to ulceration and infection. The patient's
unaffected mother was heterozygous for the 1-bp insertion, and 3
unaffected sibs were heterozygous for the Q73X mutation. The father was
deceased. Numbering of this mutation is based on the HSN exon ORF only.

Takagi et al. (2006) identified homozygosity for the 1134insT mutation
in a Japanese patient with HSAN2, born of consanguineous parents. The
insertion results in frameshift and premature termination of the protein
at residue 378. The patient noted that he felt no pain in his
extremities during his teenage years. He had recurrent skin ulcers on
his fingers and toes resulting in spontaneous or surgical amputation of
several digit tips. Physical examination at age 39 years showed no
autonomic involvement.

WNK1, 1-BP DEL, 639A

In an 18-year-old French girl with HSAN2 (201300), Shekarabi et al.
(2008) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (639delA) in the HSN2
exon of the WNK1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination. Numbering of this mutation is based on the HSN exon ORF
only. Her unaffected father and brother also carried the heterozygous
mutation. Screening of the rest of the WNK1/HSN2 isoform did not reveal
any mutations. However, subsequent screening of the girl in other exons
in the WNK1 gene revealed a heterozygous 2-bp deletion (1584_1585delAG;
605232.0011) in exon 6 of the WNK1 gene, which resulted in frameshift at
codon 531 and premature termination at codon 547 (asp531fsX547). This
mutation was inherited from the unaffected mother. Neither the girl nor
the mother showed signs of hypertension. The findings prompted Shekarabi
et al. (2008) to concluded that HSN2 is an alternative exon within WNK1,
rather than an independent gene.

VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
WNK1, ILE1172MET

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to hypokalemic salt-losing renal tubulopathy (see
241150) has not been confirmed due to the presence of an additional
heterozygous mutation in the SLC12A3 gene (600968).

In a Chinese patient who presented at 10 years of age with fatigue,
numbness, enuresis, and nocturia and was found to have hypokalemia,
metabolic alkalosis, and low to normal blood pressure and to be
heterozygous for a known splice site mutation (7426del13ins12; Shao et
al., 2008) in the SLC12A3 gene, Zhang et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for an A-G transition in exon 16 of the WNK1 gene,
resulting in an ile1172-to-met (I1172M) substitution at an
evolutionarily conserved residue within a coiled-coil domain in the C
terminus. The I1172M mutation arose de novo, as neither parent carried
the WNK1 variant, and it was not found in 400 control alleles or
reported in dbSNP or HGMD databases. However, his unaffected mother was
heterozygous for the SLC12A3 indel splice site mutation. Functional
analysis in HEK293 cells using the corresponding rat WNK1 mutation,
I918M, showed reduced SLC12A3 protein membrane expression in vitro when
cotransfected with WNK4, due to complete abolishment of the suppressive
effect of WNK4-mediated inhibition.

.0013
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
WNK1, SER2047ASN

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to hypokalemic salt-losing renal tubulopathy (see
241150) has not been confirmed due to the presence of an additional
heterozygous mutation in the SLC12A3 gene (600968).

In a Chinese man who presented at age 26 years with fatigue and
hypotonia and was found to have hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and
low to normal blood pressure and to be heterozygous for a known missense
mutation (D486N; Simon et al., 1996) in the SLC12A3 gene, Zhang et al.
(2013) identified heterozygosity for a G-A transition in exon 24 of the
WNK1 gene, resulting in a ser2047-to-asn (S2047N) substitution at a
highly conserved residue within a coiled-coil domain in the C terminus.
The S2047N WNK1 mutation was inherited from his father, who also
displayed hypokalemia, alkalosis, and hypotension; the WNK1 variant was
not found in 400 control alleles or reported in dbSNP or HGMD databases.
The affected father and the patient's asymptomatic 2-year-old daughter
also carried the SLC12A3 mutation, which was not found in other
asymptomatic family members.

;;SPERMATOGENESIS-ASSOCIATED FACTOR; SPAF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Liu et al. (2000) cloned mouse Spata5, which they called Spaf. The
deduced 892-amino acid protein contains a putative mitochondrial
localization signal and 2 ATPase modules typical of AAA family proteins
(see 601681). Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected high
expression of a 3-kb Spaf transcript in testis, with much weaker
expression in spleen and little to no expression in other tissues
examined. Spaf was also highly expressed as 3- and 1.7-kb transcripts in
mouse 03RAT cells, which were derived from a poorly differentiated
squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis detected Spaf in
prepubertal and adult mouse testis, where it was expressed in
spermatogonia and early spermatocytes up to the zygotene stage. Spaf was
not detected in somatic cells of testis. Spaf distributed diffusely
throughout the cytoplasm of germ cells and also localized to
mitochondria. Western blot analysis detected endogenous and in
vitro-translated Spaf at an apparent molecular mass of 97 kD.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the SPATA5 gene to chromosome 4q28.1 based on an
alignment of the SPATA5 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF361489) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;JNK-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; JIP1;;
ISLET-BRAIN 1; IB1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Islet-brain-1 (IB1), a regulator of pancreatic beta-cell function in
rat, is homologous to Jip1, a murine inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal
kinase (JNK; 601158). Mooser et al. (1999) reported the sequence of the
2,133-bp human IB1 cDNA, the expression, structure, and fine mapping of
the human IB1 gene, and the characterization of an IB1 pseudogene. The
human IB1 amino acid sequence is 94% identical to that of rat Ib1. The
tissue-specific expression of IB1 in human is similar to that observed
in rodent.

By mRNA dot blot analysis, Yasuda et al. (1999) found that JIP1 was
ubiquitously expressed, with highest levels in whole brain and in all
individual brain regions examined.

Whitmarsh et al. (2001) noted that there is a splice variant of mouse
Jip1 that encodes a protein lacking 47 amino acids in the C-terminal
region compared with full-length Jip1. Using immunofluorescence analysis
of primary mouse cortical neural cultures, Whitmarsh et al. (2001) found
high Jip1 expression at the tips of extended neurites, with diffuse
staining in the cytoplasm, including soma and extended neurites.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation assays, Yasuda et al. (1999) showed that the
mammalian scaffold proteins JIP1 and JIP2 (607755) interacted to form
oligomeric complexes, and they both coimmunoprecipitated with DLK
(600447), MLK2 (600137), MLK3 (600050), MKK7 (603014), and JNK. The
C-terminal portions of JIP1 and JIP2 were sufficient for interaction
with MLK3 and MKK7, and the N-terminal portions interacted with JNK. Ten
different JNK isoforms bound both JIP proteins, although binding
affinities differed between them. Double-label immunofluorescence
analysis indicated that endogenous rat Jip1 and Jip2 colocalized in
peripheral cytoplasmic projections extended at the cell surface of rat
insulinoma cells. Yasuda et al. (1999) concluded that the JIP proteins
function by aggregating components of a MAP kinase module, including
MLK, MKK7, and JNK, and facilitate signal transmission by the protein
kinase cascade.

Human islet-brain-1, a DNA-binding transactivator of the glucose
transporter GLUT2 (SLC2A2; 138160), is encoded by the MAPK8IP1 gene.
Waeber et al. (2000) evaluated the role of IB1 in beta cells by
expression of an MAPK8IP1 antisense RNA in a stable insulinoma beta-cell
line. A 38% decrease in IB1 protein content resulted in a 49% and a 41%
reduction in SLC2A2 and insulin (INS; 176730) mRNA expression,
respectively. In addition, they detected MAPK8IP1 transcripts and IB1
protein in human pancreatic islets.

Bonny et al. (2000) found high expression of Ib1 in insulin-secreting
cell lines of mouse and rat origin. Activation of Jnk, by
interleukin-1-beta (IL1B; 147720) or through an upstream Jnk activator,
reduced Ib1 content by 50 to 60%. Reduced Ib1 levels led to reduced
c-Jun (165160) phosphorylation and increased the apoptotic response to
Il1b. Overexpression of Ib1 protected pancreatic B-cell lines against
Jnk-mediated proapoptotic stimuli.

Abderrahmani et al. (2001) identified a neuron-restrictive silencer
element (NRSE) in the promoter region of MAPK8IP1 and demonstrated that
it was bound by REST (600571), a zinc finger transcriptional repressor
widely expressed in all tissues except pancreas and neuronal tissues. By
analysis of cell lines of varied tissue origin, they determined that IB1
transcript was expressed by insulin-secreting and neuron-like cell
lines, but not by cell lines that expressed the REST transcript.
Transfection and expression of REST in a B-cell line repressed IB1
transcription, and, conversely, introduction of a mutated NRSE into the
IB1 promoter allowed IB1 expression in non-B-cell and nonneuronal cell
lines. Abderrahmani et al. (2001) also found that REST-mediated
repression was dependent on histone deacetylase (see 601241) activity.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Whitmarsh et al. (2001) found that
Jip1 interacted with endogenous kinesin light chain (see 600025) in
mouse brain extracts. In cultured hippocampal neurons, Jip1 localized in
a punctate pattern to neurites. However, following stress induced by
oxygen and glucose deprivation, Jip1 accumulated in the perinuclear
region with activated Jnk and phosphorylated Jun.

Taru et al. (2002) reported that the C-terminal phosphotyrosine
interaction domain of JIP1 interacted with the GYENPTY motif within the
cytoplasmic domain of APP (104760). They found that a specific splice
variant of JIP1, designated JIP1B, modulated the processing of APP in an
interaction-dependent manner following coexpression in mouse
neuroblastoma cells. JIP1B expression stabilized immature APP and
suppressed secretion of the large extracellular N-terminal domain of
APP, release of the intracellular C-terminal fragment, and secretion of
beta amyloid peptides 40 and 42. These effects required the
phosphotyrosine interaction domain of JIP1B, but not the JNK-binding
domain, indicating that modulation of APP metabolism was independent of
the JNK signaling cascade.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mooser et al. (1999) determined that the IB1 gene contains 12 exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid analysis,
Mooser et al. (1999) mapped the MAPK8IP1 gene to 11p12-p11.2, a region
that is deleted in the Potocki-Shaffer syndrome (601224), a rare
contiguous gene syndrome caused by microdeletion.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Waeber et al. (2000) investigated MAPK8IP1 as a candidate gene for human
diabetes. Although sib-pair analyses performed on 149 multiplex French
families with type II diabetes excluded MAPK8IP1 as a major diabetogenic
locus, 1 family was found to have a missense mutation (ser59 to asn;
604641.0001) that segregated with diabetes. The mutation was associated
in vitro with an inability of IB1 to prevent apoptosis induced by
MAP/ERK kinase kinase-1 (MEKK1; 600982) and a reduced ability to
counteract the inhibitory action of the activated JNK pathway on insulin
transcriptional activity. Identification of this novel
non-maturity-onset diabetes of the young (non-MODY) form of diabetes
demonstrated that IB1 is a key regulator of beta-cell function.

ANIMAL MODEL

Thompson et al. (2001) found that targeted disruption of the Mapk8ip1
gene in mice resulted in embryonic death prior to blastocyst
implantation. In culture, no null embryos were identified, indicating
that cell death occurred during the first cell cycle. Analysis of
protein and mRNA expression in wildtype gametes and embryos revealed
Mapk8ip1 expression in oocytes, spermatozoa, and 2-cell embryos and
blastocysts. In spermatozoa, immunolocalization showed expression
restricted to the tail. No reduction in fertility of the heterozygote
was indicated. From these findings, Thompson et al. (2001) concluded
that continued Mapk8ip1 expression is required for the survival of the
fertilized oocyte.

Whitmarsh et al. (2001) found that Jip1 -/- mice were viable and fertile
and had a normal life span. In wildtype mice, excitotoxic stress caused
marked lesions with apoptotic cells in the CA3 subfield of the
hippocampus. In contrast, Jip1 -/- animals were resistant to this
excitotoxic damage. A similar protective effect of Jip1 deletion was
detected in cultured neurons, where disruption of Jip1 prevented Jnk
activation caused by exposure to excitotoxic stress and anoxic stress
and reduced the apoptotic effects of oxygen and glucose deprivation.

Using mice of a different genetic background than those used by Thompson
et al. (2001), Jaeschke et al. (2004) developed Jip1-null mice that were
viable and fertile. Mutant mice were resistant to diet-induced obesity
and showed reduced diet-induced insulin resistance. Jip1 was required
for obesity-induced Jnk activation in adipose tissue and obesity-induced
phosphorylation if Irs1 (147545) on ser307.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DIABETES MELLITUS, NONINSULIN-DEPENDENT
MAPK8IP1, SER59ASN

In a family with type II diabetes (125853) in individuals in 4
successive generations, Waeber et al. (2000) observed a change of codon
59 in exon 2 of the MAPK8IP1 gene from AGC (ser) to AAC (asn). This
serine and the surrounding amino acids are conserved in mouse, rat, and
human. The missense mutation was absent from 119 healthy subjects and
436 unrelated subjects with type 2 diabetes. The mutation segregated
with diabetes, with all 6 affected members of the family available for
study being heterozygous for this mutation. They found 2 nondiabetic
subjects, aged 41 and 44 years, who carried the S59N mutation in this
pedigree, suggesting that the S59N mutation was not fully penetrant.
They also found in some diabetic individuals as well as nondiabetic
members of the family a mutation (gln59 to leu) in the IPF1 gene,
encoding insulin promoter factor-1 (600733.0003). They suggested that
the additional variant in IPF1 may be a genetic modifier for the
diabetic phenotype.

604693	TITLE *604693 A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN 7; AKAP7
;;A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN, 18-KD; AKAP18
DESCRIPTION A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs; see 602449) direct the activity of
protein kinase A (PKA; see 176911) by tethering the enzyme near its
physiologic substrates.

By screening a fetal brain cDNA library with regulatory type II (RII)
PKA as a probe, Fraser et al. (1998) obtained a cDNA encoding a novel
AKAP protein, AKAP7, which the authors designated AKAP18. AKAP7 contains
81 amino acids. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the expression of a
major 2.9-kb transcript in pancreas, brain, and heart as well as a minor
band of 4.3 kb in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Helical wheel analysis
showed that the RII-binding amphipathic helix domain comprises residues
29 to 42. Sequence analysis identified a myristoylation signal at the
N-terminal glycine residue and 2 palmitoylation sites at cys4 and cys5.
Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy analyses
of wildtype and mutant AKAP18 showed that the lipids are required for
attachment of AKAP18 to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane.
Expression of AKAP18 in cells expressing cardiac L-type calcium channels
promoted an increase in cAMP-responsive calcium currents, suggesting
that membrane anchoring of PKA participates in physiologically relevant
events involving ion channel activation.

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Corsortium mapped the AKAP7
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP stSG41406).

604409	TITLE *604409 GLUCOCORTICOID MODULATORY ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 1; GMEB1
;;PARVOVIRUS INITIATION FACTOR, p96 SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using heat-shock protein-27 (HSP27; 602195) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
assay, Theriault et al. (1999) cloned a human cDNA encoding a deduced
573-amino acid protein that they called glucocorticoid modulatory
element-binding protein-1 (GMEB1). The GMEB1 protein has a KDWK domain,
contains sequences that are 95% identical to 3 tryptic peptides of rat
GMEB1, and shares 38% identity with rat GMEB2. A rabbit antibody raised
against a recombinant GMEB1 fusion protein detected an 85-kD polypeptide
in several human and mouse cell lines, in rat liver, and in different
mouse tissues. The authors suggested that the difference between the
apparent molecular mass of this polypeptide and the calculated molecular
mass of 62.5-kD derived from the protein sequence might reflect the high
content of acidic residues in GMEB1. By immunofluorescence of HeLa cells
expressing recombinant GMEB1, the authors localized the protein to the
nucleus. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the in vivo
interaction of HSP27 with GMEB1. GMEB1 translated in reticulocyte
lysates bound to 21-bp GME oligonucleotides in a gel-shift assay. The
resulting complex was similar in size to the complex obtained using rat
liver nucleotide extracts. Both complexes were supershifted with an
antibody specific to human GMEB1. The authors concluded that GMEB1 is a
trans-acting DNA-binding protein that may mediate the demonstrated
functions of GME as a positive modulator of the glucocorticoid response.

Christensen et al. (1999) copurified GMEB1 in a complex with GMEB2
(607451) from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Using degenerate primers
designed from the amino acid sequence followed by 5-prime and 3-prime
RACE, they cloned the full-length cDNAs. The deduced GMEB1 protein,
which they called p96, contains 563 amino acids and has a calculated
molecular mass of 60.4 kD. By SDS/PAGE analysis, the apparent molecular
mass was 96 kD. GMEB1 contains an N-terminal KDWK domain, and a highly
acidic C terminus that likely forms a coiled-coil structure. Recombinant
and endogenous GMEB1 share identical mobilities when analyzed by
SDS/PAGE analysis, indicating a lack of posttranslational modification.
Within the N-terminal KDWK domain, GMEB1 shares about 80% identity with
GMEB2; overall, they share about 40% identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Christensen et al. (1999) noted that the complex of GMEB1 and GMEB2,
which they designated parvovirus initiation factor (PIF) subunits p96
and p79, respectively, was originally recognized as a site-specific
DNA-binding complex essential for parvovirus DNA replication.
Christensen et al. (1999) found that GMEB2 and GMEB1 self-associate when
expressed alone, and that they form heterodimers when expressed
together. Cross-linking experiments indicated that no higher-order
multimers were formed. Each protein was active in promoter activation
assays, and the complex bound regulatory elements within the promoter
regions of tyrosine animotransferase (613018) and the transferrin
receptor gene (190010). Within its recognition site, PIF coordinately
bound 2 copies of the tetranucleotide PuCGPy, and these could be spaced
from 1 to 15 nucleotides apart.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GMEB1
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG1681R).

RH-NULL DISEASE, AMORPH TYPE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION Rh, elliptocytosis, PGM1, and 6PGD are all on the same chromosome. The
first 2 loci appear to lie between the latter 2 (Renwick, 1971).
Information from cell hybridization studies placed the
Rh-elliptocytosis-PGM(1)-6PGD linkage group on chromosome 1. Jacobs et
al. (1970) reported data suggesting a loose linkage between a
translocation breakpoint near the end of the long arm of chromosome 1
and Rh. Lamm et al. (1970) published family data consistent with loose
linkage of Duffy and PGM1. Renwick (1971) suggested that PGM1 is on the
side of Rh, remote from 6PGD and about 30 centimorgans from Rh. Cook et
al. (1972) confirmed this interval. Although the Rh and Duffy loci are
both on chromosome 1, they are too far apart to demonstrate linkage in
family studies (Sanger et al., 1973). Marsh et al. (1974) found
Rh-negative erythrocytes in an Rh-positive man suffering from
myelofibrosis. Nucleated hemopoietic precursors were circulating in his
blood, and these cells had an abnormal chromosome complement from which
part of the short arm of chromosome 1 had been deleted. They concluded
that the Rh locus probably lies on the distal segment of the short arm
at some point between 1p32 and the end of the short arm. The conclusion
is consistent with the finding of Douglas et al. (1973) that the PGM1
locus, which is linked to Rh, is on the short arm of chromosome 1. Since
the patient of Marsh et al. (1974) did not have deletion of the PGM1
locus in the mutant clone, the Rh locus is probably distal to the PGM1
locus. Corney et al. (1977) observed only 1 recombination in 58
opportunities between the alpha-fucosidase locus (FUCA1; 612280) and the
Rh locus. Rh antigen still eludes chemical definition (Tippett, 1978),
but it is thought to be a lipoprotein. No completely certain example of
recombination within a postulated gene complex has been described.
Steinberg (1965) described a Hutterite family in which the father was
CDe-cde, mother cde-cde, 4 children cde-cde, 3 children CDe-cde, and 1
child (the 6th born) Cde-cde. Steinberg (1965) thought this was an
instance of crossing-over. Mutation and, much less likely, a recessive
suppressor of the D antigen were mentioned as other possibilities. Race
and Sanger (1975) considered a recessive suppressor likely.
(Illegitimacy was excluded by the mores of the sect and by marker
studies.) Rosenfield (1981) wrote: 'We still know nothing about Rh.
Except for Steinberg's one crossover, there have been no exceptions to
the inheritance of Rh antigens in tight haplotype packages. Hopefully,
Rh antigen will be isolated for characterisation but there has been
nothing published since the report of Plapp et al. (1979).' Steinberg et
al. (1984) reexamined the Hutterite family, making use of other markers
thought to be on 1p (6PGD, Colton, UMPK1) and concluded that crossover
or mutation indeed had occurred. (Colton is probably not on chromosome
1p; UMPK1 was not informative in the critical parent (Lewis, 1989).)
They concluded further that if, as seems likely from other evidence, C
lies between D and E, their data indicate that the D gene (116800) is
distal (telomeric) in the Rh complex. This order is consistent with the
rare Rh haplotype D. Race et al. (1950, 1951) considered this haplotype
to represent a probable or possible deletion in a human Rh chromosome.
Race and Sanger (1975) listed 20 homozygotes for this haplotype.
Originating from various populations, they were, in about 80% of the
cases, the products of consanguineous matings. Olafsdottir et al. (1983)
concluded that this Rhesus haplotype is not very rare in Iceland. They
estimated the frequency to be about 1 in 214 persons. They discovered
the haplotype in 2 unrelated women because of difficulty with
crossmatching. Both had formed Rh antibodies, one provoked by
transfusions and the other by 3 pregnancies.

Saboori et al. (1988) purified Rh protein in relatively large amounts
from Rh(D)-positive and -negative blood. Differences in the peptide maps
of the 2 proteins were found. Blanchard et al. (1988) presented indirect
data based on immunologic and biochemical investigations demonstrating
that the Rh D, c, and E polypeptides of the erythrocyte membrane are
homologous but distinct molecular species that can be physically
separated and analyzed. These polypeptides have a molecular weight of
about 32,000. Polypeptides c and E were found by Blanchard et al. (1988)
to be more closely related to each other than to D. All the observations
were consistent with partial divergence among homologous members of a
family of Rh proteins. In a review completed in early 1988, Issitt
(1988) suggested that current molecular genetic methods could finally
end 50 years of speculation as to the genetic determination of the Rh
blood groups. Cherif-Zahar et al. (1990) isolated cDNA clones encoding a
human blood group Rh polypeptide from a human bone marrow cDNA library
using a PCR amplified DNA fragment encoding the known common N-terminal
region of the Rh proteins. Translation of the open reading frame
indicated that the Rh protein is composed of 417 amino acids, including
the initiator methionine, which is removed in the mature protein, that
it lacks a cleavable N-terminal sequence, and that it has no consensus
site for potential N-glycosylation. Hydropathy analysis and predictions
of secondary structure suggested the presence of 13 membrane-spanning
domains, indicating that the Rh polypeptide is highly hydrophobic and
deeply buried within the phospholipid bilayer. In Northern analysis, the
Rh cDNA probe detected a major 1.7-kb and a minor 3.5-kb mRNA species in
erythroid tissues but not in adult liver and kidney tissues or lymphoid
and promyelocytic cell lines. By in situ hybridization using an Rh
protein probe, Cherif-Zahar et al. (1991) mapped the Rh gene to
1p36.1-p34.3.

Whether the 3 sets of Rh antigens--D, Cc, and Ee--that are inherited en
bloc represent separate epitopes on a single protein (as maintained by
Wiener, 1944) or multiple independent proteins encoded by closely linked
genes (as first suggested by Fisher in 1944 (Race, 1944)) has been
controversial since the discovery of the Rh antigens in the early 1940s.
Cherif-Zahar et al. (1990) quoted work of Blanchard et al. (1988)
suggesting that the Rh D, c, and E antigens are carried by 3 distinct
but homologous membrane proteins that share a common N-terminal protein
sequence. It is possible that these are the product of one gene with
multiple splicing alternatives. See also review by Agre and Cartron
(1991). Colin et al. (1991) used Rh cDNA as a probe in Southern analysis
of the Rh locus. They demonstrated that in all Rh D-positive persons 2
strongly related Rh genes are present per haploid genome, whereas 1 of
these 2 genes is missing in Rh D-negative donors. Colin et al. (1991)
concluded that 1 of the 2 genes of the Rh locus encodes the Rh C/c and
Rh E/e polypeptides while the other encodes the Rh D protein. (Both
Fisher and Wiener were partly right.) The absence of any D gene and of
its postulated allelic form d in the Rh D-negative genome explains why
no Rh d antigen has ever been demonstrated.

Using cDNAs amplified from reticulocyte mRNA, Mouro et al. (1993)
investigated CcEe gene differences in Rh-negative individuals homozygous
for dCe, dcE, and dce haplotypes. The RNA analysis was followed by PCR
amplification of specific exons using genomic DNA from donors carrying a
range of common Rh haplotypes. The Ee polypeptide was shown to be
synthesized from the full-length transcript of the CcEe gene and to be
identical in length (417 residues) and very similar in sequence to the D
polypeptide. The Cc polypeptides were synthesized from shorter
transcripts of the same CcEe gene sequence, but spliced so as to exclude
exons 4, 5, and 6 or exons 4, 5 and 8. In both cases, the residue at 226
in exon 5 associated with Ee antigenicity was omitted from the
polypeptide product; see 111700.0001 and 111700.0002. Also see review by
Hopkinson (1993).

The Rh-null phenotype is of 2 types. The most common type, called the
'regulator type,' occurs by an inhibition mechanism; see 268150. This
form is caused by homozygosity for an autosomal recessive suppressor
gene that is genetically independent of the Rh locus, mapping to
chromosome 3 rather than to chromosome 1. The second type of Rh-null,
which was first described in a Japanese family (Ishimori and Hasekura,
1967), is called the 'amorph type' and results from homozygosity for a
silent allele at the Rh locus. In a survey of 42 examples of the Rh-null
phenotype, Nash and Shojania (1987) found that only 5 were of the amorph
type. Perez-Perez et al. (1992) described a Spanish family in which a
silent Rh gene was segregating, giving rise to the amorph type of
Rh-null in the proposita whose parents were first cousins. She suffered
from severe hemolytic anemia. Western blot analysis carried out with
glycosylation-independent antibodies directed against the Rh polypeptide
and the LW glycoprotein, respectively, confirmed that these protein
components were absent from the red cells of the proposita.

Investigations by Cherif-Zahar et al. (1993) failed to reveal any
alteration of the RH genes and transcripts in Rh-null of the silent
type, and they suspected that these variants have a transcriptional or
post-transcriptional alteration of RH genes. Cherif-Zahar et al. (1996)
analyzed the RH locus and sequenced the Rh transcripts from 5
Rh-deficient phenotypes caused by an autosomal suppressor gene (reg and
mod types). They were unable to detect any abnormality; these variants
did not express RH genes but did convey a functional RH locus from one
generation to the next. They also detected no gross alteration in the
CD47 gene structure; transcripts were easily amplified and the
nucleotide sequence was identical to that from controls. This agreed
with binding studies indicating that CD47 is present on the red cell
surface of Rh-deficient cells, although severely reduced (10-15% of
controls). In general, their findings suggested that the low expression
of CD47 on Rh-null erythrocytes results from the defective assembly or
transport to the cell surface when Rh proteins are absent.

Cherif-Zahar et al. (1994) demonstrated that the RHCE gene has 10 exons
distributed over 75 kb. Exons 4 to 8 are alternatively spliced in the
different RNA isoforms. Primary extension analysis indicated that the
transcription initiation site is located 83 bp upstream of the
initiation codon. Study of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic (HeLa)
cell lines and Northern blot analysis suggested that the expression of
the RH locus is restricted to the erythroid/megakaryocytic lineage.
Consistent with this, putative binding sites for SP1, GATA-1, and Ets
proteins, nuclear factors known to be involved in erythroid and
megakaryocytic gene expression, were identified in the promoter of the
RHCE gene.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

Mollison (1994) reviewed the genetic basis of the Rh blood group system,
giving a brief survey of the early history. Rosenfield (1989) had
described the bitter disagreements between Wiener and Levine,
particularly over priority of discovery. Mollison (1994) reviewed the
disagreement between A. S. Wiener, who postulated multiple alleles at a
single locus (Wiener, 1943), and R. A. Fisher, who interpreted the data
of R. R. Race (1944) as most compatible with the existence of 3 closely
linked genes. Cartron and Agre (1993) reviewed the protein and gene
structure of the Rh blood group antigens. In summary, Rh-positive
persons have 2 Rh genes, 1 encoding the Cc- and Ee-bearing protein or,
more likely, proteins, and a second encoding the D-bearing protein,
while Rh-negative persons have only 1 Rh gene, the first of the 2
described above.

Cartron et al. (1995) defended the 2-gene model of the Rh blood group
system. They suggested that the RHCE gene encodes the C/c and E/e
proteins through alternative splicing of the primary transcript.
D-positive and D-negative individuals differ on the basis of the
presence or absence of the RHD gene (111680), as a rule; in some
Australian Aborigines and Blacks, a fragment of the RHD gene or a
nonfunctional RHD gene is present. Smythe et al. (1996) found that both
c and E antigens were expressed after transduction of K562 cells with a
single cDNA, indicating that the c antigen does not arise by alternative
splicing (exon skipping) of the product of the RHCE gene.

Valenzuela et al. (1991) reported a strong association between plasma
total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and Cc Rh specificity in a Chilean
primary school population in Santiago. Valenzuela et al. (1995) found
similar results in university students from Medellin, Colombia.

In a 3-generation family ascertained through the East of Scotland Blood
Transfusion Service in Dundee, Scotland, Huang et al. (1996) found that
a cataract-causing mutation was cosegregating with an autosomal dominant
anomaly of Rh type known as the Evans phenotype. The geography and the
genetic linkage suggested that the form of cataract may be the same as
that in the Danish family. The red cell Evans phenotype is produced by a
hybrid RH gene in which exons 2-6 from the RHD gene is transferred to
the RHCE gene. Kemp et al. (1996) also examined 5 unrelated Rh D--
homozygotes and found that, in 4 of them, RHCE sequences had been
replaced by RHD sequences. The 5-prime end of these rearrangements
occurred within a 4.2-kb interval around exon 2. There was, however,
heterogeneity at the 3-prime end of the rearranged genes, indicating
that they were not identical by descent, but rather that independent
recombination events had occurred within a small genomic interval--a
recombination hotspot.

Fisher and Race (1946) proposed a model for the evolution of the RH
polymorphism in which the less common haplotypes (CDE, Cde, cdE, and
CdE) are generated and maintained by recombination from those found at
higher frequency. The frequency ratios of the supposed parental and
recombinant haplotypes suggested that the arrangement D-C-E was most
likely under the crossing-over hypothesis. At the time, they assumed
that the 3 series of antigens were encoded in 3 separate genes; the work
outlined earlier indicated that there are 2. Thus recombination between
the sites encoding C/c and E/e would be intragenic, and occur between
exons that are separated by approximately 30 kb (Cherif-Zahar et al.,
1994). Carritt et al. (1997) presented direct evidence for nonreciprocal
intergenic exchange (gene conversion) occurring once in human history to
generate the common RHCE allele, Ce. They also used new polymorphisms to
construct haplotypes which suggested that intragenic recombination
played a major role in the generation of the less common haplotypes, but
only if RHD lies 3-prime of RHCE, i.e., the order is C-E-D. They
provided both genetic and physical evidence supporting this arrangement.

The high degree of homology between the coding regions of the RHCE and
RHD genes is consistent with an ancestral gene duplication. Carritt et
al. (1997) concluded that the human lineage started with the haplotype
cDe. This is consistent with its very high incidence in black Africans
and their descendants (0.4 to 0.5, compared to less than 0.1 elsewhere).
The common haplotype underlying the RhD- phenotype (cde) almost
certainly represented a loss of RHD from cDe. This haplotype is entirely
absent from some aboriginal groups, e.g., Australian, Eskimo, and
Navajo. How the RhD- haplotype became established in a predominantly
RhD+ population, given the moderate to strong selection against RHD+/-
heterozygotes imposed by fetomaternal incompatibility, was still
unknown. As first pointed out in 1942 by Haldane (1942) and reexamined
by Hogben (1943), Li (1953), and others, selection against heterozygotes
results in unstable population equilibria. In an extended simulation
study, Feldman et al. (1969) concluded that, while reproductive
compensation on the part of RhD- mothers can, in principle, lead to
stable equilibria in the face of such selection, other forces, for
example, heterozygote advantage, must operate to maintain RhD+:RhD-
ratios at their observed levels.

Suto et al. (2000) analyzed the organization of the RH genes by 2-color
fluorescence in situ hybridization on DNA fibers released from
lymphocytes (fiber-FISH) and by using DNA probes of introns 3 and 7 of
the RHCE and RHD genes. Six Rh-positive samples (2 with the D+C-c+E+e-,
2 with the D+C+c-E-e+, and 2 with the D+C+c+E+e+ phenotype) showed the
presence of 2 RH genes within a region of less than 200 kb. Of great
interest was the finding that the genes were arranged in antidromic
order starting from the telomere: tel--RHCE (5-prime to 3-prime)--RHD
(3-prime to 5-prime)--centromere. On the other hand, 2 typical
Rh-negative samples (D-C-c+E+e+) showed the presence of only 1 RHCE
gene, as expected.

Wagner and Flegel (2000) showed that the RH locus represents a gene
cluster: RHD (111680) and RHCE face each other by their 3-prime tail
ends, and a third gene, SMP1 (605348), is interspersed between the 2
rhesus genes. The RHD gene deletion was parsimoniously explained by an
unequal crossing-over event. The inverse orientation of the RH genes may
facilitate gene conversion among both rhesus genes, which would explain
the high frequency of hybrid alleles.

The duplication of the rhesus gene occurred during primate evolution
(Matassi et al., 1999), giving rise to the RHD and RHCE genes in humans.
Thus nonprimate mammals, such as mice, may reveal the ancient state of
the RH locus. With this in mind, Wagner and Flegel (2002) analyzed the
sequence of the region. Based on the gene positions and orientations,
RHCE was determined to represent the ancestral state. The close
proximity of SMP1 and RH known in humans was also observed in the mouse
RH locus. Wagner and Flegel (2002) concluded that RHD arose by
duplication of RHCE. The orientation of RHD was probably inverted during
this event. The so-called rhesus boxes, two 9,000-bp DNA segments of
identical orientation flanking the RHD gene, may have been instrumental
for the duplication.

Avent and Reid (2000) provided a comprehensive review of the Rh blood
group system.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RH E/e POLYMORPHISM
RHCE, PRO226ALA

Mouro et al. (1993) showed that the difference between the classic
allelic antithetical E and e antigens depends on a point mutation in
exon 5 which changes proline to alanine at residue 226 in the e allele.

.0002
RH C/c POLYMORPHISM
RHCE, CYS16TRP, ILE60LEU, SER68ASN, AND SER103PRO

Mouro et al. (1993) showed that the difference between the classic
allelic antithetical C and c antigens depends on point mutations leading
to 4 amino acid substitutions in exons 1 and 2 in the c allele.

.0003
RH-NULL DISEASE, AMORPH TYPE
RHCE, 2-BP DEL, 966T AND 968A

As noted earlier, RH-null disease (which includes the amorphic and
regulator (268150) types) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by
stomatocytosis and chronic hemolytic anemia. Huang et al. (1998) studied
a German family transmitting a putative amorph Rh-null disease gene.
They analyzed the genomic and transcript structure of Rh30, Rh50
(180297), and CD47 (601028), the 3 loci thought to be most critical for
expression of the Rh complex in the red blood cell membrane. They showed
that in this family the Rh50 and CD47 transcripts were normal in primary
sequence. However, the Rh30 locus contained an unusual double mutation
in exon 7 of the RHCE gene, in addition to a deletion of the RhD gene.
The mutation targeted 2 adjacent codons in multiple arrangements,
probably via the mechanism of microgene conversion. One scheme entailed
a noncontiguous deletion of 2 nucleotides, ATT(ile322) to AT and
CAC(his323) to CC, whereas the other involved a T-to-C transition,
ATT(ile322) to ATC, and a dinucleotide deletion, CAC(his323) to C. They
caused the same shift in open reading frame predicted to encode a short
protein with 398 amino acids. The loss of 2 transmembrane domains and
gain of a new C-terminal sequence probably altered the protein
conformation and impaired the Rh complex assembly. The findings
established the molecular identity of an amorph Rh-null disease gene,
showing that Rh30 and Rh50 are both essential for the functioning of the
Rh structures as a multisubunit complex in the plasma membrane.

603646	TITLE *603646 CYTOCHROME c OXIDASE ASSEMBLY PROTEIN COX15; COX15
;;COX15, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cytochrome c oxidase (COX; EC 1.9.3.1), the terminal component of the
mitochondrial respiratory chain, is a multiheteromeric enzyme embedded
in the mitochondrial inner membrane. COX consists of a protein backbone
bound to 2 copper-containing prosthetic groups, the cytochromes a and
a-3. See 123864. The S. cerevisiae cox15 protein is a constituent of the
inner mitochondrial membrane and may be involved in the assembly of the
COX protein backbone (Petruzzella et al., 1998).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences related to cox15, Petruzzella
et al. (1998) identified cDNAs encoding human COX15. The cDNAs encoded 2
COX15 isoforms, COX15.1 and COX15.2, with different C termini. The amino
acid sequences of both isoforms are 42% identical to that of yeast
cox15. Sequence analysis indicated that COX15 contains a mitochondrial
leader peptide and 5 transmembrane domains. Using in vitro mitochondrial
import and trypsin-protection assays, the authors demonstrated that the
COX15 protein is targeted to mitochondria. Northern blot analysis
revealed that COX15 is expressed as 1.5-, 1.8-, and 3-kb mRNAs
predominantly in tissues characterized by high rates of oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS), including muscle, heart, and brain.

MAPPING

Based on sequence similarity to ESTs, Petruzzella et al. (1998)
tentatively mapped the COX15 gene to 10q24.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Deficiencies in the activity of COX are a frequent cause of autosomal
recessive mitochondrial disease in infants (220110). These patients are
clinically and genetically heterogeneous. The defects identified in this
group have mostly involved genes coding for accessory proteins that play
important roles in the assembly of the COX holoenzyme complex. Antonicka
et al. (2003) used a panel of retroviral vectors expressing COX assembly
factors in these patients to identify the molecular basis of the COX
deficiency by functional complementation. They showed that
overexpression of COX15, a protein involved in the synthesis of heme A,
the heme prosthetic group for COX, could functionally complement the
isolated COX deficiency in fibroblasts from a patient with fatal
infantile who had predominantly cardiac involvement and relative sparing
of skeletal muscle (CEMCOX2; 615119).

Mutation analysis of COX15 in the patient identified an arg217-to-trp
(R217W; 603646.0001) mutation in 1 allele and a splice site mutation in
intron 3 on the other allele (C447-3G), resulting in deletion of exon 4
(603646.0002). In the patient, mitochondrial heme A content was reduced
in heart and fibroblast mitochondria, and levels of heme O were
increased in heart. COX activity and the total amount of fully assembled
enzyme were reduced by 50 to 70% in fibroblasts. Expression of COX15
increased heme A content and rescued COX activity. Thus, it appeared
that reduced availability of heme A stalls the assembly of COX. This
study established COX15 as an additional cause, along with SCO2, of
fatal infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with isolated COX
deficiency.

Oquendo et al. (2004) reported a patient with Leigh syndrome (256000)
due to cytochrome c oxidase deficiency who was homozygous for the R217W
mutation in the COX15 gene.

Bugiani et al. (2005) reported a 16-year-old Italian boy with Leigh
syndrome who was compound heterozygous for a nonsense mutation (S151X;
603646.0003) and a missense mutation (S344P; 603646.0004) in the COX15
gene. The authors noted that defects in the COX15 gene appear to be
associated with considerable clinical and biochemical heterogeneity.

In an infant girl with isolated complex IV deficiency that was more
marked in cardiac than skeletal muscle, who died at day 9 of life with
encephalopathy, respiratory depression, and marked cardiac hypertrophy
of all walls, Alfadhel et al. (2011) analyzed 6 candidate genes and
identified compound heterozygosity for the R217W missense mutation and a
nonsense mutation (S151X; 603646.0003) in the COX15 gene.

In a female infant who had fatal infantile cytochrome c oxidase
deficiency with predominantly cardiac involvement and relative sparing
of skeletal muscle (CEMCOX2; 615119), originally reported by Kennaway et
al. (1990), Antonicka et al. (2003) identified compound heterozygosity
for a 700C-T transition on 1 allele, resulting in an arg217-to-trp
(R217W) substitution, and a splice site mutation in intron 3 on the
other allele (C447-3G), resulting in deletion of exon 4 (603646.0002).
The splicing error introduced a frameshift and a premature stop codon,
resulting in an unstable mRNA and, likely, a null allele.

In an infant girl with isolated complex IV deficiency that was more
marked in cardiac than skeletal muscle, who died at day 9 of life with
encephalopathy, respiratory depression, and marked cardiac hypertrophy,
Alfadhel et al. (2011) identified compound heterozygosity for the R217W
missense mutation and a nonsense mutation (S151X; 603646.0003) in the
COX15 gene.

In a patient with Leigh syndrome due to cytochrome c oxidase deficiency
(256000), Oquendo et al. (2004) identified homozygosity for the R217W
mutation. Both parents were heterozygous for the mutation. The authors
noted the phenotypic variation associated with this mutation.

COX15, SER151TER

In a 16-year-old Italian boy with Leigh syndrome (256000), Bugiani et
al. (2005) identified compound heterozygosity for a 452C-G transversion
in exon 4 of the COX15 gene, resulting in a ser151-to-ter (S151X)
substitution, and a 1030T-C transition in exon 8, resulting in a
ser344-to-pro (S344P; 603646.0004) substitution at a conserved residue
in the C-terminal end of the fifth predicted transmembrane domain. The
patient failed to thrive in infancy, with poor sucking and feeding
difficulties, and was noted to have severe psychomotor delay at 4 months
of age, with diffuse hypotonia and muscle wasting and weakness. MRI at
18 months of age showed symmetric signal changes in the posterior part
of the putamina and bilateral cerebellar white matter abnormalities.
Plasma lactate and pyruvate levels were markedly elevated. Symptoms
worsened thereafter with virtual arrest of body growth, progressive loss
of postural control, and onset of dystonic postures in the upper limbs,
whereas cognitive functions remained relatively better preserved.
Clinical features remained grossly unchanged thereafter, and apart from
central nervous system and skeletal muscle, the patient showed no
abnormality in other tissues or organs, including the heart,
gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidneys, or hematopoietic system.

614517	TITLE *614517 ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR-LIKE PROTEIN 2; ARNTL2
;;BRAIN AND MUSCLE ARNT-LIKE PROTEIN 2; BMAL2;;
CYCLE-LIKE FACTOR; CLIF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ARNTL2 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)/PAS domain transcription
factor (Maemura et al., 2000).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to BMAL1 (ARNTL;
602550), followed by PCR of a fetal brain cDNA library and RACE of an
adult brain cDNA library, Ikeda et al. (2000) cloned ARNTL2, which they
called BMAL2. The deduced 551-amino acid protein has an N-terminal bHLH
domain, followed by PASA and PASB domains and a long C-terminal
sequence. It has 2 putative nuclear localization signals near its N
terminus. BMAL2 shares 52% amino acid identity with zebrafish Bmal2 and
49% identity with human BMAL1. Northern blot analysis detected BMAL2
transcripts of 7.0 and 8.0 kb in adult liver and fetal brain. A 2.2-kb
BMAL2 transcript was also detected in adult liver. No expression was
detected in adult heart, brain, pancreas, placenta, and lung and fetal
lung, liver, and kidney. Fluorescence-tagged BMAL2 was expressed
predominantly in the nucleus of transfected HEK293 cells.

Using EPAS1 (603349) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human
umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cDNA library, Maemura et al.
(2000) cloned ARNTL2, which they called CLIF. The deduced 602-amino acid
protein contains a bHLH/PAS domain and shares 44.1% identity with
Drosophila Cycle and 44.9% identity with human BMAL1. It differs from
the BMAL2 protein reported by Ikeda et al. (2000) at its N terminus.
Northern blot analysis detected widespread and variable expression of
CLIF transcripts of 8, 6, 2.4, and 2.2 kb. Highest CLIF expression was
detected in brain and placenta. In situ hybridization revealed
expression of CLIF transcripts in endothelial cells of human heart,
lung, and kidney and in endothelial cells and neurons of brain.

GENE FUNCTION

By deletion analysis, Ikeda et al. (2000) found that the N-terminal
basic region of BMAL2 was required for nuclear localization.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of HUVEC cDNA, Maemura et al. (2000) found
that CLIF interacted with EPAS1 and CLOCK (601851), the major regulator
of circadian rhythm. Mobility shift assays and mutation analysis showed
that CLIF formed a heterodimer with CLOCK and bound to the E-box of the
PER1 (602260) promoter. Coexpression of CLIF with CLOCK in HUVECs
resulted in elevated CLOCK-dependent PAI1 (SERPINE1; 173360) expression,
and mutation of the E-boxes within the PAI1 promoter abrogated binding
by CLIF/CLOCK. PER2 (603426) and CRY1 (601933) inhibited
CLIF/CLOCK-dependent transactivation of the PAI1 promoter.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ikeda et al. (2000) determined that the ARNTL2 gene contains 14 coding
exons.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Ikeda et al. (2000) mapped the ARNTL2 gene to chromosome
12p12.2-p11.2.

605117	TITLE *605117 SUPPRESSOR OF CYTOKINE SIGNALING 2; SOCS2
;;STAT-INDUCED STAT INHIBITOR 2; SSI2; STATI2;;
CYTOKINE-INDUCIBLE SH2 PROTEIN 2; CIS2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SOCS proteins, such as SOCS2, negatively regulate cytokine receptor
signaling via the Janus kinase (see 147795)/signal transducer and
activation of transcription (STAT; see 600555) pathway (the JAK/STAT
pathway) (Minamoto et al., 1997).

CLONING

By a computer-aided homology search of sequence databases, Minamoto et
al. (1997) identified a partial sequence of SSI2, a member of the SSI
(STAT-induced STAT inhibitor) gene family. They isolated an SSI2 cDNA
from a Jurkat cDNA library. SSI2 encodes a protein of 198 amino acids.
The deduced amino acid sequences of human SSI2 and SSI3 (604176) share
significant homology with human and mouse SSI1 (SOCS1; 603597) and mouse
Cis (602441) at the C-terminal region as well as in the SH2 domain.
Northern blot analysis revealed strong expression of SSI2 in heart,
placenta, lung, kidney, and prostate.

On the basis of an EST database search, Masuhara et al. (1997)
identified SOCS2, which they called CIS2. They found that a C-terminal
40-amino acid region, designated the CIS homology (CH) domain, and the
SH2 domain are highly conserved in the CIS genes, while the respective
N-terminal regions of these proteins share little similarity.

Dey et al. (1998) identified SOCS2 based on its interaction with the
cytoplasmic domain of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF1R;
147370) in a yeast 2-hybrid screen. They cloned a full-length SOCS2 cDNA
by 5-prime RACE PCR of a human fetal brain cDNA library. Northern blot
analysis demonstrated expression of SOCS2 in many human fetal and adult
tissues, with particular abundance in fetal kidney and adult heart,
skeletal muscle, pancreas, and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Minamoto et al. (1997) found that SSI2 expression was induced by
cytokine stimulation, and its forced expression in the mouse myeloid
leukemia cell line M1 suppressed the apoptotic affects of LIF (159540)
similarly to SSI1.

Dey et al. (1998) found that the human SOCS2 protein interacted strongly
with the activated IGF1R and not with a kinase-negative mutant receptor
in yeast 2-hybrid assays. Mutation of receptor tyrosines 950, 1250,
1251, and 1316 to phenylalanine or deletion of the C-terminal 93 amino
acids did not result in decreased interaction of the receptor with human
SOCS2 protein. SOCS2 interacted with IGF1R both in vitro and in vivo.
Dey et al. (1998) concluded that their results raised the possibility
that SOCS proteins may play a regulatory role in IGF1 receptor
signaling.

Machado et al. (2006) showed that lipoxin A4 (LXA4) activated 2
receptors in mouse splenic dendritic cells, Ahr (600253) and Lxar
(FPRL1; 136538), and that this activation triggered Socs2.
Socs2-deficient mouse dendritic cells were hyperresponsive to microbial
stimuli and were refractory to the inhibitory action of LXA4, but not
Il10 (124092). Upon infection with an intracellular pathogen,
Socs2-deficient mice had uncontrolled production of proinflammatory
cytokines, decreased microbial proliferation, aberrant leukocyte
infiltration, and elevated mortality. Machado et al. (2006) also showed
that Socs2 was a crucial intracellular mediator of the antiinflammatory
actions of aspirin-induced lipoxins in vivo.

GENE STRUCTURE

Metcalf et al. (2000) demonstrated that the mouse SOCS2 gene is composed
of 3 exons and 2 introns.

MAPPING

By cytogenetic and radiation hybrid mapping, Yandava et al. (1999)
mapped the SOCS2 gene to chromosome 12q21.3-q23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kato et al. (2006) performed a region-wide association analysis on
12q15-q22 using more than 500 SNPs in 1,492 unrelated Japanese
individuals and identified an association between type II diabetes
(125853) and a 13.6-kb haplotype block that includes the entire SOCS2
gene. Five SNPs in the 5-prime region of the SOCS2 gene were
significantly associated with type II diabetes. Kato et al. (2006)
concluded that SOCS2 may play a role in susceptibility to type II
diabetes in the Japanese.

ANIMAL MODEL

Metcalf et al. (2000) generated mice deficient in Socs2 by targeted
disruption. Socs2-deficient mice were indistinguishable from their
littermates until weaning at 3 weeks of age, but subsequently grew more
rapidly. Socs2 -/- adult males were on average 40% heavier than wildtype
littermates. Adult Socs2 +/- males exhibited an intermediate body
weight. Increased growth was also significant but less marked in female
Socs2 -/- mice. Adult Socs2 -/- females typically attained the weight of
wildtype male mice, but heterozygous Socs2 females were not
significantly heavier than sex-matched wildtype littermates. Neither
male nor female Socs2 -/- mice accumulated significantly more fatty
tissue than wildtype mice. Rather, increased body weight in these mice
resulted from an increase in the weight of most visceral organs.
Sexually dimorphic or male-specific organs were not disproportionately
enlarged. Carcass weight was also significantly increased, indicating
that muscle and bone may contribute significantly to the increased size
of Socs2-deficient mice. There was significant increase in long bone
length. Tail length was normal. The increase in size was due to elevated
cell numbers rather than increased cell size. Metcalf et al. (2000)
observed a marked thickening of the dermis associated with excessive
collagen accumulation in all of 7 males, and less prominently in 6 of 8
female Socs2 -/- mice. Collagen deposition was also increased around the
bronchi and vessels of the lungs of 6 of the 9 male, but only 3 of 10
female, Socs2-deficient mice. No hematologic abnormalities were
observed. The characteristics of Socs2 -/- mice were similar to those of
mice with growth hormone (GH; 139250) excess and IGF1 (147440) excess.
Characteristics of deregulated growth hormone and IGF1 signaling,
including decreased production of major urinary protein, increased local
IGF1 production, and collagen accumulation in the dermis were observed
in Socs2-deficient mice, indicating that Socs2 may have an essential
negative regulatory role in the growth hormone/IGF1 pathway.

Turnley et al. (2002) studied the role of Socs2 in mouse neural
development. They found that Socs2 was expressed by mouse progenitor
cells and neurons in response to LIF-like cytokines. Progenitor cells
lacking Socs2 produced fewer neurons and more astrocytes in vitro. Socs2
-/- mice had fewer neurons and neurogenin-1 (NGN1; 601726)-expressing
cells in the developing cortex, whereas overexpression of Socs2
increased neuronal differentiation. Turnley et al. (2002) found that GH
inhibited Ngn1 expression and neuronal production, and this action was
blocked by Socs2 overexpression. They speculated that Socs2 promotes
neuronal differentiation by blocking GH-mediated downregulation of Ngn1.

Using GH-deficient Socs2 -/- mice, Greenhalgh et al. (2005) demonstrated
that the Socs2 -/- phenotype is dependent upon the presence of
endogenous GH. Treatment with exogenous GH induced excessive growth in
terms of overall body weight, body and bone lengths, and the weight of
internal organs and tissues. Microarray analysis on liver RNA extracts
after exogenous GH administration revealed a heightened response to GH.
The conserved C-terminal SOCS-box motif was essential for all inhibitory
function. SOCS2 was found to bind 2 phosphorylated tyrosines on the GH
receptor (600946), and mutation analysis of these amino acids showed
that both were essential for SOCS2 function. Greenhalgh et al. (2005)
concluded that SOCS2 is a negative regulator of GH signaling.

600108	TITLE *600108 MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 13; MMP13
;;COLLAGENASE 3; CLG3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Freije et al. (1994) cloned a cDNA coding for a novel human matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP) from a cDNA library derived from a breast tumor.
The isolated cDNA contains an open reading frame coding for a
polypeptide of 471 amino acids. The predicted protein sequence displays
extensive similarity to previously known MMPs and presented all the
structural features characteristic of this protein family, including the
well-conserved PRCGXPD motif. In addition, it contains in its amino acid
sequence several residues specific to the collagenase subfamily (tyr214,
asp235, and gly237) and lacks the 9-residue insertion present in the
stromelysins. Because of the structural characteristics, Freije et al.
(1994) called the new MMP collagenase-3 (CLG3), since it represented the
third member of this family, composed of fibroblast (MMP1; 120353) and
neutrophil (MMP8; 120355) collagenases. Northern blot analysis of RNA
from normal and pathologic tissues demonstrated the existence in breast
tumors of 3 different mRNA species, which seemed to be the result of
utilization of different polyadenylation sites present in the 3-prime
noncoding region of the gene. By contrast, no CLG3 mRNA was detected
either by Northern blot or RNA polymerase chain reaction analysis with
RNA from other human tissues, including normal breast, mammary
fibroadenomas, liver, placenta, ovary, uterus, prostate, and parotid
gland. A possible role for this metalloproteinase in the tumoral process
was proposed.

GENE FUNCTION

Freije et al. (1994) expressed CLG3 cDNA in a vaccinia virus system and
found that the recombinant protein was able to degrade fibrillar
collagens, providing support to the idea that it codes for an authentic
collagenase.

Mitchell et al. (1996) concluded that the expression of MMP13 in
osteoarthritic cartilage and its activity against type II collagen
indicates that the enzyme plays a significant role in cartilage collagen
degradation and must, therefore, form part of a complex target for
proposed therapeutic interventions based on collagenase inhibition.
Reboul et al. (1996) likewise presented data on collagenase-3 expression
and synthesis in human cartilage cells and suggested its involvement in
human osteoarthritis cartilage pathophysiology.

Lausch et al. (2009) suggested that there is a functional link between
MMP13 and MMP9 (120361) in the endochondral ossification, as impaired
MMP9 protein function, caused by direct inactivation (in recessive
disease due to MMP9 loss of function), impaired activation (in recessive
disease due to MMP13 loss of function), or transcatalytic degradation
(in dominant disease caused by MMP13 gain of function) appears to be a
common downstream step in the pathogenesis of metaphyseal anadysplasia.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pendas et al. (1997) reported that the MMP13 gene contains 10 exons and
spans approximately 12.5 kb. The overall gene organization is similar to
those of other MMP genes, including MMP1, MMP7 (178990), and MMP12
(601046).

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Pendas et al. (1995) localized
the CLG3 gene (also symbolized MMP13) to 11q22.3. Physical mapping of a
YAC clone containing CLG3 revealed that this gene is tightly linked to
those genes encoding other matrix metalloproteinases, including
fibroblast collagenase (MMP1), stromelysin-1 (MMP3; 185250), and
stromelysin-2 (MMP10; 185260). Further mapping of this region using
pulsed field gel electrophoresis showed that the CLG3 gene is located on
the telomeric side of the matrix metalloproteinase cluster. Pendas et
al. (1995) found the relative order of the loci to be
cen--STMY2--CLG1--STMY1--CLG3--tel. Pendas et al. (1996) isolated a
1.5-Mb YAC clone mapping to 11q22. Detailed analysis of this nonchimeric
YAC clone ordered 7 MMP genes as follows:
cen--MMP8--MMP10--MMP1--MMP3--MMP12--MMP7--MMP13--tel.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasias (SEMDs) are a heterogeneous group
of skeletal disorders featuring defective growth and modeling of the
spine and long bones. In affected members of a family segregating the
Missouri type of SEMD (602111) originally described by Patel et al.
(1993), Kennedy et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for a missense
mutation (F56S; 600108.0001) in the MMP13 gene. Kennedy et al. (2005)
predicted, by modeling MMP13 structure, that the F56S mutation would
result in a hydrophobic cavity with misfolding, autoactivation, and
degradation of mutant protein intracellularly. Expression of wildtype
and mutant MMP13s in human embryonic kidney cells confirmed abnormal
intracellular autoactivation and autodegradation of F56S MMP13 such that
only enzymatically inactive, small fragments were secreted. Thus, the
F56S mutation results in deficiency of MMP13, which leads to the human
skeletal developmental anomaly seen in the Missouri form of SEMD.

Lausch et al. (2009) investigated the molecular basis of metaphyseal
anadysplasia in 5 families and identified heterozygous (see
600108.0002-600108.0003) or homozygous (600108.0004) mutations in the
MMP13 gene in 4; see MANDP1 (602111). In the fifth family, they
identified a mutation in the MMP9 gene (120361.0002); see MANDP2
(613073). Lausch et al. (2009) found that recessive metaphyseal
anadysplasia is caused by homozygous loss of function of either MMP9 or
MMP13, whereas dominant metaphyseal anadysplasia is caused by missense
mutations in the prodomain of MMP13 that determine autoactivation of
MMP13 and intracellular degradation of both MMP13 and MMP9, resulting in
a double enzymatic deficiency.

ANIMAL MODEL

By gene targeting, Inada et al. (2004) created Mmp13-null mice.
Homozygous null mice were born at predicted mendelian ratios and
appeared healthy at birth. However, mutant mice showed profound defects
in growth plate cartilage, with markedly increased hypertrophic domains,
as well as delayed endochondral ossification and formation and
vascularization of primary ossification centers. Absence of Mmp13
resulted in significant interstitial collagen accumulation due, in part,
to lack of collagenase-mediated cleavage that normally occurs in growth
plates and primary ossification centers. Cartilaginous growth plate
abnormalities persisted in adult mice and phenocopied defects observed
in human hereditary chondrodysplasias.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPONDYLOEPIMETAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, MISSOURI TYPE
MMP13, PHE56SER

In the Missouri family with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (602111)
originally described by Patel et al. (1993), Kennedy et al. (2005)
demonstrated that the disorder was caused by a 252T-C transition in
codon 56 of the MMP13 gene that resulted in substitution of serine for
an evolutionarily conserved phenylalanine residue (F56S) in the
proregion domain of the protein.

.0002
METAPHYSEAL ANADYSPLASIA 1, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
MMP13, PHE55SER

In 3 affected members of a German family segregating a dominant form of
metaphyseal anadysplasia (see 602111), Lausch et al. (2009) identified
heterozygosity for a 249-C transition in the MMP13 gene, resulting in a
phe55-to-ser (F55S) substitution in the prodomain. The mutation was not
found among 228 alleles of ancestry-matched unaffected individuals.

.0003
METAPHYSEAL ANADYSPLASIA 1, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
MMP13, MET72THR

In 7 patients from 2 families, one German and the other Japanese,
segregating a dominant form of metaphyseal anadysplasia (see 602111),
Lausch et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a 300T-C transition
in exon 2 of the MMP3 gene, resulting in an met72-to-thr (M72T)
substitution in the prodomain. The mutation was not present among 228
alleles of ancestry-matched unaffected individuals.

.0004
METAPHYSEAL ANADYSPLASIA 1, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
MMP13, HIS213ASN

In a Moroccan patient with metaphyseal anadysplasia (see 602111), whose
family was consanguineous, Lausch et al. (2009) identified homozygosity
for a 722C-A transition in exon 5 of the MMP13 gene, which changed the
highly conserved histidine 213 of the catalytic domain to asparagine
(H213N) in the predicted open reading frame of proMMP13. The parents
were heterozygous for the mutation and unaffected sibs were either
heterozygous or homozygous wildtype. The mutation was not found among
228 alleles of unaffected controls.

601783	TITLE *601783 MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 6; MAP6
;;MTAP6;;
STABLE TUBULE-ONLY POLYPEPTIDE; STOP;;
KIAA1878
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mammalian cells often contain abundant subpopulations of microtubules
that are stable to both drug- and cold temperature-induced disassembly.
Such microtubules are apparently universal in the neurite extensions of
neuronal cells. Bosc et al. (1996) cloned and characterized the gene
encoding a rat protein that reconstitutes microtubule cold stability in
vitro. The protein, called stable tubule-only polypeptide (STOP) by
them, is a 100.5-kD polypeptide. The central region of the predicted
952-amino acid polypeptide contains 5 tandem repeats of 46 amino acids.
STOP also contains a putative SH3-binding motif near its N terminus.

Denarier et al. (1998) determined that the deduced mouse Map6 protein
contains 906 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of about
96.4 kD.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult hippocampus
cDNA library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned MAP6, which they designated
KIAA1878. The transcript contains a repetitive element in the 3-prime
UTR. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest MAP6 expression in fetal brain,
followed by spinal cord, adult brain, testis, kidney, lung, heart, and
ovary. Lower expression was detected in pancreas, spleen, and skeletal
muscle, and little to no expression was detected in adult and fetal
liver. All specific brain regions showed intermediate to high
expression, with highest expression in caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and
cerebellum.

GENE FUNCTION

Bosc et al. (1996) found that in vitro-translated STOP bound to
microtubules and calmodulin (114180). When STOP cDNA was expressed in
HeLa cells, which lack cold-stable microtubules, the protein product
associated with microtubules at 37 degrees C and stabilized microtubule
networks, which induced cold stability, nocodazole resistance, and
tubulin detyrosination.

GENE STRUCTURE

Denarier et al. (1998) determined that the mouse Map6 gene contains 4
exons and spans about 40 kb. The 5-prime flanking region lacks a TATA
box or an initiator element.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the MAP6 gene
to chromosome 11. Jolly et al. (1999) reported a conflicting assignment
of the human MAP6 gene to chromosome 6p12-p11 by FISH. However, Andrieux
et al. (2002) confirmed that the human MAP6 gene maps to chromosome
11q14.

Using FISH, Denarier et al. (1998) mapped the mouse Map6 gene to region
E2-F1 of chromosome 7, which shows homology of synteny to human
chromosome 11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Andrieux et al. (2002) found that Stop-null mice had no detectable
defects in brain anatomy, but they showed synaptic defects, with
depleted synaptic vesicle pools and impaired synaptic plasticity,
associated with severe behavioral disorders. A survey of the effects of
psychotropic drugs on the behavior of Stop-null mice showed a specific
effect of long-term administration of neuroleptics in alleviating these
disorders.

614177	TITLE *614177 EF-HAND CALCIUM-BINDING DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 4A; EFCAB4A
;;CALCIUM RELEASE-ACTIVATED CALCIUM CHANNEL REGULATOR 2B; CRACR2B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a human database for sequences similar to CRACR2A (EFCAB4B;
614178), followed by RT-PCR of Jurkat human T cells, Srikanth et al.
(2010) cloned EFCAB4A, which they called CRACR2B. The deduced 399-amino
acid protein contains 2 N-terminal EF hand motifs and a C-terminal
coiled-coil domain. Mouse and human EFCAB4A share 36% overall identity,
with highest similarity in the EF-hand motifs and coiled-coil domain.
Quantitative RT-PCR revealed variable EFCAB4A expression in all human
tissues and cell lines examined, with highest expression in lung and
lower expression in HEK293 cells, Jurkat cells, spleen, placenta, and
kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

ORAI1 (610277) and STIM1 (605921) are critical components of calcium
release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels involved in store-operated
calcium entry into cells. Srikanth et al. (2010) found that EFCAB4B was
a calcium-binding protein that regulated CRAC channel activity.
Depletion of EFCAB4B from Jurkat T cells, more so than from HEK293
cells, decreased store-operated calcium entry. In contrast, depletion of
EFCAB4A had a stronger effect on store-operated calcium entry in HEK293
cells than in Jurkat T cells. These effects correlated with relatively
higher EFCAB4B expression in Jurkat cells and higher EFCAB4A expression
in HEK293 cells. Depletion and restoration studies revealed functional
redundancy between EFCAB4B and EFCAB4A.

GENE STRUCTURE

Srikanth et al. (2010) determined that the EFCAB4A gene contains at
least 9 exons.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the EFCAB4A gene to chromosome 11p15.5 based on an
alignment of the EFCAB4B sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC033196) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

induced by M phase-promoting factor, or MPF (see CCNB1; 123836). In M
phase, many proteins are phosphorylated directly by MPF or indirectly by
kinases activated by MPF. These M-phase phosphoproteins (MPPs, or
MPHOSPHs) permit disassembly of interphase structures and generation of
M-phase enzymatic activities and structures.

By treating bacterial expression libraries with M-phase cytosol
containing the relevant kinases in the presence of a phosphatase
inhibitor, followed by immunoscreening with MPM2 antibody,
Matsumoto-Taniura et al. (1996) isolated cDNAs for a number of MPHOSPHs,
including MPHOSPH9, which they called MPP9. Immunoblot analysis showed
that when phosphorylated, MPHOSPH9 is expressed as 150- and 160-kD
proteins in M-phase cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy localized
MPHOSPH9 to the Golgi complex in interphase, strongly overlapping with
the localization of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (NAGT1; see
160995). However, in mitotic cells, MPHOSPH9 was dispersed throughout
the cell and did not localize to the Golgi fragments containing NGAT1.

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
MPHOSPH9 gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP sts-N23129).

;;Mi2-BETA
DESCRIPTION See CHD1 (602118) for a description of this gene family.

CLONING

Approximately 20% of patients with dermatomyositis develop antibodies
against nuclear antigens that are termed Mi2. Sera containing anti-Mi2
antibodies precipitate several proteins, with 1 of the most abundant
migrating as a 220- to 260-kD polypeptide on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. By
immunoscreening a HeLa cell cDNA expression library with sera from a
patient with dermatomyositis, Seelig et al. (1995) isolated a
full-length cDNA encoding CHD4, which they called Mi2-beta. Northern
blot analysis of Hep-2 cell RNA detected an approximately 6.8-kb
Mi2-beta transcript. The deduced 1,912-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 218 kD. Native Mi2-beta from Hep-2 cells
has a molecular mass of 235 kD by SDS-PAGE. Searches of sequence
databases indicated that Mi2-beta belongs to the SNF2/RAD54 family of
nuclear helicases. The central portion of Mi2-beta contains the 7
motifs, including a DEAD/H box, that are characteristic of helicases.
Mi2-beta also contains a putative chromatin-binding region and multiple
potential nuclear targeting signals, N-glycosylation sites,
N-myristoylation sites, and phosphorylation sites. Immunofluorescence
studies localized the Mi2-beta protein to the nucleus. The authors
concluded that Mi2-beta is a major antigen recognized by anti-Mi2 sera
from patients with dermatomyositis. Studies with sera from
dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus (152700), and rheumatoid
arthritis (180300) patients showed that anti-Mi2-beta antibodies are
predominantly found in dermatomyositis patients.

Seelig et al. (1996) noted that the Mi2-alpha (CHD3; 602120) and
Mi2-beta proteins react with most or all dermatomyositis patient
anti-Mi2 sera. While these proteins are distinct, they have stretches of
identical sequences that could result in shared epitopes. The authors
stated that Mi2-alpha and Mi2-beta contain a PHD motif, which is a zinc
finger-like motif with a cys4-his-cys3 pattern and which is thought to
be a DNA- or RNA-binding domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (1998) reported the isolation of a protein complex that
contains both histone deacetylation and ATP-dependent nucleosome
remodeling activities. The complex contained the histone deacetylases
HDAC1/2, histone-binding proteins, the dermatomyositis-specific
autoantigen Mi2-beta, a polypeptide related to the metastasis-associated
protein-1, and a novel polypeptide of 32 kD. Patients with
dermatomyositis have a high rate of malignancy. The finding that
Mi2-beta exists in a complex containing histone deacetylase and
nucleosome remodeling activities suggests a role for chromatin
reorganization in cancer metastasis.

Zhang et al. (1999) showed that MTA2 (MTA1L1; 603947) and the 32-kD MBD3
(603573) protein are subunits of the NURD (nucleosome remodeling and
histone deacetylase) complex (see MTA1; 603526). Immunoprecipitation
analysis showed that MBD3 interacts with HDAC1 (601241), RBBP4 (602923),
and RBBP7 (300825), but not with MI2, suggesting that MBD3 is embedded
within the NURD complex. The authors found that MTA2 directs the
assembly of an active histone deacetylase complex and that the
association of MTA2 with the complex requires MBD3. Gel mobility shift
analysis determined that both NURD and MBD3 are unable to bind to
methylated DNA in the absence of MBD2 (603547). Zhang et al. (1999)
proposed that NURD is involved in the transcriptional repression of
methylated DNA. Wade et al. (1999) also identified MTA1, MTA1L, and MBD3
as components of the NURD complex, which they referred to as the MI2
complex.

By immunoprecipitation analysis, Shimono et al. (2005) found that MCRS1
(609504) interacted with MI2-beta, RFP (TRIM27; 602165), and UBF (UBTF;
600673). Yeast 2-hybrid screening showed that the central region of
MCRS1 interacted with the ATPase/helicase region of MI2-beta and the
coiled-coil region of RFP. Confocal microscopy demonstrated
colocalization of MCRS1, MI2-beta, RFP, and UBF in nucleoli. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays showed that MCRS1, MI2-beta, and RFP
associated with rDNA and were involved in transactivation of ribosomal
gene transcription, which could be downregulated by small interfering
RNA-mediated downregulation of MCRS1, MI2-beta, and RFP. Shimono et al.
(2005) concluded that MI2-beta and RFP, which are involved in
transcriptional repression in the nucleus, associate with MCRS1 in the
nucleolus and are involved in activation of rRNA transcription.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Seelig et al. (1995) mapped the
CHD4 gene to 12p13.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Le Gallo et al. (2012) used whole-exome sequencing to comprehensively
search for somatic mutations in 13 primary serous endometrial tumors
(see 608089), and subsequently resequenced 18 genes that were mutated in
more than 1 tumor and/or were components of an enriched functional
grouping from 40 additional serous tumors. Le Gallo et al. (2012)
identified a high frequency of somatic mutation in the CHD4 gene (17%).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NFKB1 (164011) or NFKB2 (164012) is bound to REL (164910), RELA, or RELB
(604758) to form the NFKB complex. The p50 (NFKB1)/p65 (RELA)
heterodimer is the most abundant form of NFKB. The NFKB complex is
inhibited by I-kappa-B proteins (NFKBIA, 164008 or NFKBIB, 604495),
which inactivate NFKB by trapping it in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation
of serine residues on the I-kappa-B proteins by kinases (IKBKA, 600664,
or IKBKB, 603258) marks them for destruction via the ubiquitination
pathway, thereby allowing activation of the NFKB complex. Activated NFKB
complex translocates into the nucleus and binds DNA at kappa-B-binding
motifs such as 5-prime GGGRNNYYCC 3-prime or 5-prime HGGARNYYCC 3-prime
(where H is A, C, or T; R is an A or G purine; and Y is a C or T
pyrimidine).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Zhong et al. (1998) reported that the transcriptional activity of
NF-kappa-B is stimulated upon phosphorylation of its p65 subunit on
serine-276 by protein kinase A (PKA). The transcriptional coactivator
CBP (600140)/p300 (602700) associates with NF-kappa-B p65 through 2
sites, an N-terminal domain that interacts with the C-terminal region of
unphosphorylated p65, and a second domain that only interacts with p65
phosphorylated on serine-276. Phosphorylation by PKA both weakens the
interaction between the N- and C-terminal regions of p65 and creates an
additional site for interaction with CBP/p300. Therefore, PKA regulates
the transcriptional activity of NF-kappa-B by modulating its interaction
with CBP/p300.

Jacobs and Harrison (1998) and Huxford et al. (1998) determined the
structure of the NFKBIA ankyrin repeat domain, bound to a partially
truncated NFKB heterodimer (p50/p65), by x-ray crystallography at 2.7-
and 2.3-angstrom resolution, respectively. It shows a stack of 6 NFKBIA
ankyrin repeats facing the C-terminal domains of the NFKB rel homology
regions. Contacts occur in discontinuous patches, suggesting a
combinatorial quality for ankyrin repeat specificity. The first 2
repeats cover an alpha helically ordered segment containing the p65
nuclear localization signal. The position of the sixth ankyrin repeat
shows that full-length NFKBIA will occlude the NFKB DNA-binding cleft.
The orientation of NFKBIA in the complex places its N- and C-terminal
regions in appropriate locations for their known regulatory functions.
Baeuerle (1998) discussed the model of interactions between NFKBIA and
NFKB.

GENE FUNCTION

Chen et al. (2001) noted that the events involved in the release of NFKB
from IKBA are relatively well understood, but the regulation of nuclear
forms of NFKB that ensure transient transcriptional responses are less
well delineated. Luciferase reporter analysis showed that treatment with
trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of multiple histone deacetylases
(e.g., HDAC1; 601241), results in prolonged intranuclear expression of
RELA after TNFA (191160) stimulation. Expression of HDAC3 (605166), but
not other HDACs, was found to inhibit kappa-B luciferase activity and
abolish the acetylation of RELA, which is mediated by p300 or CBP but
not PCAF (602303), in the absence of TSA. Coimmunoprecipitation and
mammalian 2-hybrid analyses indicated that RELA and HDAC3 associate
through their N termini. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that
coexpression of RELA with HDAC3, but not with HDAC1, results in
cytoplasmic instead of nuclear localization of RELA, and this is
dependent on the expression of exportin-1 (XPO1; 602559). Coexpression
of HDAC3 in the presence of p300 allowed binding of RELA to IKBA,
suggesting that deacetylation of RELA stimulates IKBA binding and the
termination of the NFKB transcriptional response. Fluorescence
microscopy showed that in the presence of HDAC3, RELA expression shifts
to the cytoplasm in wildtype murine embryo fibroblasts but not in
fibroblasts obtained from Ikba -/- mice, indicating that IKBA is
required for the nuclear export of deacetylated RELA. Chen et al. (2001)
concluded that RELA is a nonhistone substrate of HDAC3 and that
IKBA-dependent nuclear export of the HDAC3-deacetylated RELA replenishes
the depleted cytoplasmic pool of latent NFKB-IKBA complexes for
subsequent NFKB responses.

Zhong et al. (2002) demonstrated that transcriptionally inactive nuclear
NFKB in resting cells consists of homodimers of either p65 or p50
complexed with the histone deacetylase HDAC1. Only the p50-HDAC1
complexes bound to DNA and suppressed NFKB-dependent gene expression in
unstimulated cells. Appropriate stimulation caused nuclear localization
of NFKB complexes containing phosphorylated p65 that associated with CBP
and displaced the p50-HDAC1 complexes. These results demonstrated that
phosphorylation of p65 determines whether it associates with either CBP
or HDAC1, ensuring that only p65 entering the nucleus from cytoplasmic
NFKB-IKB complexes can activate transcription.

Because therapeutics inhibiting RAS and NFKB pathways are used to treat
human cancer, experiments assessing the effects of altering these
regulators have been performed in mice. The medical relevance of murine
studies is limited, however, by differences between mouse and human
skin, and by the greater ease of transforming murine cells. To study RAS
and NFKB in a setting more relevant to human tumorigenesis, Dajee et al.
(2003) expressed the active HRAS gly12-to-val mutation (190020.0001),
NFKB p65, and a stable NFKB repressor mutant of IKBA (164008) in human
skin tissue. Although implicated in promoting features of neoplasia in
other settings, coexpression of oncogenic RAS with NFKB subunits failed
to support proliferation. Coexpression of RAS and IKBA produced large
neoplasms with deep invasion through fat into underlying muscle and
fascia, similar to human squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), in 3 weeks.
Dajee et al. (2003) demonstrated that growth arrest triggered by
oncogenic RAS can be bypassed by IKBA-mediated blockade of NFKB and that
RAS opposed the increased susceptibility to apoptosis caused by NFKB
blockade, generating malignant human epidermal tissue resembling SCC.

Smahi et al. (2002) reviewed the NFKB signaling pathway, with emphasis
on its dysregulation in the genetic disorders incontinentia pigmenti
(308300), hypohidrotic/anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (see 305100),
anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (EDA-ID; 300291),
and EDA-ID with osteopetrosis and lymphoedema (300301).

In rat sciatic nerves, Nickols et al. (2003) found that expression of
the activated p65 subunit of NFKB was high in the nuclei of
premyelinating Schwann cells and then progressively declined until it
was nearly absent in adults. NFKB expression preceded and was necessary
for the upregulation of the transcription factor Oct6 (POU3F1; 602479),
which has been shown to play a role in the differentiation of promyelin
cells to myelinating cells. The authors concluded that NFKB is upstream
of Oct6 induction and is also required for the formation of peripheral
myelin.

Using cDNA microarray and in vitro analyses, Kelly et al. (2004) found
that the commensal bacterium Bacteroides thetaioatomicron attenuated
inflammatory responses, notably IL8 (146930) production, in intestinal
cell lines exposed to pathogenic Salmonella enteritidis and a number of
other inflammatory mediators. The commensal organism induced CRM1
(XPO1)-independent nuclear export, rather than import only, of the NFKB
subunit RELA, with an eventual predominance of RELA cytoplasmic
distribution after the peak of RELA induction by IL1A (147760) and IL1B
(147720). RELA nucleocytoplasmic redistribution coincided with export of
PPARG (601487), and immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that
PPARG-RELA association was dependent on the PPARG C-terminal
ligand-binding domain. Kelly et al. (2004) concluded that at least some
commensal bacteria contribute to immune homeostasis through an
antiinflammatory mechanism involving PPARG and NFKB.

Mazzeo et al. (2004) found positive immunostaining for activated p65
NFKB in nerve biopsies from 5 patients with chronic inflammatory
demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP; see 139393), 5 with familial
amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP; see 176300), and 3 with vasculitis.
Mild to moderate staining was detected in 2 to 15% of epineurial and
endoneurial vessel walls, 5 to 10% of outer layers of myelin sheaths,
and in amyloid deposits of FAP. There was an association between NFKB
staining and localization of the terminal membrane attack complex (MAC)
of the complement system. No staining was seen in 3 control specimens.
Mazzeo et al. (2004) suggested a role for NFKB in inflammatory
conditions of the peripheral nervous system.

Signaling by the transcription factor NFKB involves its release from IKB
in the cytosol, followed by translocation into the nucleus. NFKB
regulation of I-kappa-B-alpha transcription represents a delayed
negative feedback loop that drives oscillations in NFKB translocation.
Nelson et al. (2004) reported that single-cell time-lapse imaging and
computational modeling of NFKB localization showed asynchronous
oscillations following cell stimulation that decreased in frequency with
increased I-kappa-B-alpha transcription. Transcription of target genes
depended on oscillation persistence, involving cycles of NFKB
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Nelson et al. (2004) concluded
that the functional consequences of NFKB signaling may thus depend on
number, period, and amplitude of oscillations.

Barken et al. (2005) commented on the paper by Nelson et al. (2004),
suggesting that altering expression levels of fluorescently-tagged
signal proteins can severely affect the dynamic behavior of the
signaling pathway under study and cautioning against equating the
signaling behavior of genetically engineered cells with that of normal
cells. In response to the comment by Barken et al. (2005), Nelson et al.
(2005) stated that their experimental data showed no correlation between
NF-kappa-B (RelA) expression level and oscillation dynamics. Nelson et
al. (2005) showed that a small change to the computational model used by
Barken et al. (2005) to generate their theoretical data reduced the
apparent discrepancies. Cell system differences and possible
compensatory changes to normal signaling in their genetically knockout
cells may explain differences between the 2 studies.

Liu et al. (2006) showed that preexisting nuclear RELA positively
regulates ultraviolet (UV) irradiation-induced activation of JNK (MAPK8;
601158). In UV-irradiated mouse fibroblasts, they found that Pkc-delta
(176977) was required for Rela to activate Jnk, thereby contributing to
UV-induced apoptosis.

By genomewide mapping of RELA-bound loci in lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-stimulated monocytes, together with global gene expression
profiling, Lim et al. (2007) identified an overrepresentation of the
E2F1 (189971)-binding motif among RELA-bound loci associated with NFKB
target genes. Knockdown of endogenous E2F1 impaired the LPS inducibility
of the proinflammatory cytokines CCL3 (182283), IL23A (605580), TNF, and
IL1B. Sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation and coimmunoprecipitation
analysis showed that E2F1 existed as a complex with p50/RELA in
LPS-stimulated monocytes. Lim et al. (2007) concluded that NFKB recruits
E2F1 to positively regulate a spectrum of NFKB target genes.

Using knockdown, transfection, and protein interaction experiments with
human cell lines and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Mao et al. (2009)
showed that a complex of COMMD1 (607238), GCN5 (KAT2A; 602301), and CUL2
(603135) mediated ubiquitination of RELA, an event required for proper
termination of RELA-promoter interactions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
experiments showed that COMMD1 or GCN5 deficiency prolonged promoter
occupancy by RELA. IKK-dependent phosphorylation of RELA on ser468
enhanced binding of GCN5 to RELA and RELA ubiquitination.

GENE STRUCTURE

Deloukas and van Loon (1993) determined the complete genomic structure
of the human gene and a partial structure of the mouse gene encoding
p65. The human gene consists of 10 exons and spans about 8.1 kb of DNA.
A surprisingly high degree of conservation of intronic sequences was
observed between the species. Variants generated by alternative splicing
of intron 6 were observed in both species and the existence of another
as yet unknown splice variant of p65 was predicted.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Mathew et al. (1993)
demonstrated that the NFKB3 gene is located on 11q13. Using a YAC
containing the entire NFKB3 gene and FISH, Deloukas et al. (1994) found
2 sites of hybridization, 11q12 and Xp11.4, for sequences present in the
YAC. The NFKB3 gene was assigned to 11q12 by PCR analysis of a panel of
relevant hybrid cell lines.

ANIMAL MODEL

Beg et al. (1995) made a transgenic knockout mouse line for RelA and
showed that loss of the protein led to embryonic lethality at 15-16 days
of gestation as a result of massive degeneration of the liver due to
apoptosis.

Neurath et al. (1996) reported direct evidence for the involvement of
p65 in chronic intestinal inflammation induced in mice and suggested a
potential molecular therapeutic approach to the treatment of patients
with Crohn disease (see 266600) using p65 antisense oligonucleotides.

In order to study the effect of Rela deficiency on mouse skin, Zhang et
al. (2004) harvested Rela -/- embryo skin prior to embryonic lethality
around embryonic day 15.5 and grafted it onto immune-deficient mice.
Histologic examination revealed that Rela deficiency led to epidermal
hyperplasia and moderately increased cell size. The granular and
cornified layers appeared normal, and there was no inflammatory cell
infiltration. Rela -/- keratinocytes exhibited enhanced proliferation in
culture. Tnfr1 (191190)-dependent Jnk (601158) activation occurred in
Rela -/- epidermis, and Jnk inhibition abolished hyperproliferation due
to Rela deficiency. Furthermore, the hyperproliferation of
Rela-deficient skin was completely reversed in Rela-Tnfr1
double-knockout skin. Zhang et al. (2004) concluded that RELA
antagonizes TNFR1-JNK proliferative signals in epidermis and plays a
nonredundant role in restraining epidermal growth.

Gugasyan et al. (2004) found that mutant mice lacking both c-rel and
RelA displayed multiple epidermal defects, including thin epidermis and
failure to form tylotrich hair. Although mutant keratinocytes underwent
terminal differentiation, mutant basal keratinocytes were abnormally
small, showed growth delay, and failed to form colonies in culture. The
findings indicated that c-rel and RelA regulate skin development in a
redundant manner and that both are required for normal epidermal
development in mice.

120580	TITLE *120580 COMPLEMENT COMPONENT 1, s SUBCOMPONENT; C1S
;;COMPLEMENT COMPONENT C1s
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

MacKinnon et al. (1987) derived the complete amino acid sequence of C1s
from molecular cloning of cDNA. Tosi et al. (1987) presented the
complete cDNA sequence of C1s. Kusumoto et al. (1988) found that the
amino acid sequence of C1s was 40.5% identical to that of C1r (216950),
with excellent matches of tentative disulfide bond locations conserving
the overall domain structure of C1r.

MAPPING

By means of a cDNA in somatic cell hybrids, Cohen-Haguenauer et al.
(1986) assigned the C1S and C1R (216950) genes to chromosome 12.

Leppert et al. (1987) found a maximum lod score of 5.99 at theta = 0.038
for linkage between C1S and one of the PRP loci (see 168710); the
maximum lod score between C1R and another PRP locus was 4.21 at theta =
0.001. Although C1r and C1s are structurally and functionally similar,
with a significant degree of sequence homology suggesting origin by gene
duplication, cDNA probes for human C1r and C1s do not cross-hybridize
even at mild stringency conditions and are therefore gene-specific.

Using a panel of human-rodent cell hybrids, Van Cong et al. (1988)
independently assigned the C1r and C1s genes to chromosome 12. In situ
hybridization confirmed these assignments and localized the genes to
12p13.

By hybridization of C1r and C1s probes to restriction endonuclease
fragments of genomic DNA, Tosi et al. (1987) demonstrated close physical
linkage of the genes. This finding was consistent with their evolution
through tandem gene duplication and was also consistent with the
previously observed combined hereditary deficiencies of C1r and C1s (see
216950). Their coordinate expression may depend on the close linkage.
The 2 genes lie in a DNA stretch not longer than 50 kb.

By DNA blotting and sequencing analyses of genomic DNA and of an
isolated genomic DNA clone, Kusumoto et al. (1988) showed that the C1r
and C1s genes are closely located in a 'tail-to-tail' arrangement at a
distance of about 9.5 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Inoue et al. (1998) reported a patient with selective C1s deficiency
(613783) resulting from a homozygous mutation in the C1S gene
(120580.0001).

In a 27-month-old girl with multiple autoimmune diseases, Dragon-Durey
et al. (2001) detected selective C1S deficiency (613783) resulting from
a homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 12 of the C1S gene (120580.0002).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
C1s DEFICIENCY
C1S, 4-BP DEL, NT1087

In a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome and chronic
glomerulonephritis, Inoue et al. (1998) reported the molecular basis of
selective C1s deficiency (613783). No C1s protein was detectable by
immunoblot. By Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis, C1s mRNA was of
appropriate size, but only 10% of the level detected in HCS2/8, a human
chondrosarcoma cell line. Levels of beta-actin and C1r mRNA were similar
to levels detected in HCS2/8. The patient was homozygous for a 4-bp
deletion in exon 10 of the C1S gene, 1087-1090delTTTG. This deletion
resulted in a premature termination codon 94 bp downstream.

.0002
C1s DEFICIENCY
C1S, ARG534TER

In a 27-month-old girl with multiple autoimmune diseases, Dragon-Durey
et al. (2001) determined that an absence of plasma C1s (613783)
accounted for a lack of classic complement (CH50) pathway activity.
Microsatellite and sequence analyses revealed a C-to-T transition in
codon 534 in exon 12 of the C1S gene, resulting in an arg-to-ter
substitution and premature termination. DNA analysis indicated that both
parents were heterozygous for the mutation. Restriction enzyme analysis
showed that the propositus was homozygous for the mutation, while a
paternal grandmother, maternal grandfather, and aunts on both sides of
the family were heterozygous. The mutation was not detected in systemic
lupus erythematosus (152700) patients or unrelated Caucasian controls,
including some from the same geographic region. At age 5, the child was
alive and well while receiving immunosuppressive drugs daily and
penicillin.

607781	TITLE *607781 PROGESTIN AND ADIPOQ RECEPTOR FAMILY, MEMBER 5; PAQR5
;;MEMBRANE PROGESTIN RECEPTOR, GAMMA; MPRG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using homology with the sequence of seatrout membrane progestin
receptor, Zhu et al. (2003) identified ESTs containing MPRG, and they
cloned full-length human, mouse, and pufferfish MPRG cDNAs. The deduced
proteins contain about 330 amino acids, consisting of an extracellular N
terminus, an intracellular C terminus, and 7 transmembrane domains.
Northern blot analysis detected a 5.8-kb transcript expressed at high
levels only in kidney. RNA dot blot analysis detected highest expression
in adult and fetal kidney, colon, lung carcinoma, and HeLa cells, and
showed possible expression in adrenal gland and normal lung.

Tang et al. (2005) stated that the 7-transmembrane domain of the
full-length 330-amino acid PAQR5 protein shares significant similarity
with those of ADIPOR1 (607945) and ADIPOR2 (607946). The mouse ortholog
shares 91% amino acid identity with human PAQR5. RT-PCR detected highest
PAQR5 expression in human lung, colon, and small intestine. Weaker
expression was detected in pancreas, lymph node, kidney, brain, testis,
bladder, skin, and adult bone marrow, and little to none was detected in
adrenal gland, stomach, skeletal muscle, adipose, liver, prostate,
breast, heart, and thymus.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhu et al. (2003) determined that recombinant MPRG, expressed by E.
coli, showed high-affinity progesterone binding. Steroid competition
studies showed specific binding to progesterone and several of its
hydroxylated derivatives, whereas estrogen, androgen, and corticosteroid
had low or no affinity for the receptor. Association and dissociation
kinetics were rapid.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tang et al. (2005) determined that the PAQR5 gene contains 7 coding
exons.

MAPPING

Zhu (2003) stated that the human MPRG gene maps to chromosome 15. By
genomic sequence analysis, Tang et al. (2005) mapped the PAQR5 gene to
chromosome 15q23.

600041	TITLE *600041 PURINERGIC RECEPTOR P2Y, G PROTEIN-COUPLED, 2; P2RY2
;;PURINOCEPTOR P2Y2; P2Y2; P2Y2R;;
P2U NUCLEOTIDE RECEPTOR; P2UR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Parr et al. (1994) reported the sequence and functional expression of a
cDNA cloned from human airway epithelial cells that encodes P2RY2, a
protein with properties of a P2U nucleotide receptor. They also isolated
an identical cDNA from human colonic epithelial cells, indicating that
this is the same P2U receptor that had been functionally identified in
other human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

The chloride ion secretory pathway that is defective in cystic fibrosis
(219700) can be bypassed by an alternative pathway for chloride ion
transport that is activated by extracellular nucleotides. Accordingly,
the P2 receptor that mediates this effect is a therapeutic target for
improving chloride secretion in CF patients. Using a retrovirus system,
Parr et al. (1994) stably expressed a human airway P2RY2 clone in 1321N1
astrocytoma cells, a human cell line unresponsive to extracellular
nucleotides. Studies of inositol phosphate accumulation and
intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization induced by extracellular nucleotides
in 1321N1 cells expressing the receptor identified this clone as the
target receptor in human airway epithelia. Expression of P2RY2 in 1321N1
cells revealed evidence for autocrine ATP release and stimulation of
transduced receptors. Thus, P2RY2 expression in the cell line was
proposed as a useful system for studying autocrine regulatory mechanisms
and for screening potential therapeutic drugs.

Katzur et al. (1999) reported that in single endometrial carcinoma
HEC-1A and Ishikawa cells, ATP induced a rapid and extracellular
Ca(2+)-independent rise in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration in a
dose-dependent manner, with an ED50 of about 10 microg. This
ligand-selective profile indicated the expression of the P2RY2 subtype
in endometrial cells. Accordingly, RT-PCR using P2RY2 primers amplified
the expected transcript from both cell lines. The coupling of these
receptors to phospholipase C was confirmed. The authors concluded that
P2RY2 may participate in control of the cell cycle of endometrial
carcinoma cells.

Tai et al. (2000) studied the expression and regulation of the P2UR gene
in human granulosa-luteal cells (GLCs) by RT-PCR and Northern blot
analysis. Expression of P2UR mRNA was downregulated by human chorionic
gonadotropin (CG) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Treatment with
8-bromo-cAMP and forskolin also attenuated P2UR mRNA levels. The authors
concluded that the P2UR mRNA is expressed in human GLCs and that P2UR
mRNA is regulated by human CG, cAMP, and forskolin. These findings
further supported a potential role of this neurotransmitter receptor in
the human ovary.

Adrian et al. (2000) analyzed the expression of several purinergic
receptors during differentiation in a promyelocytic leukemia cell line.
Granulocytic differentiation was induced by dimethylsulfoxide, and a
monocytic/macrophage phenotype was induced by phorbol esters. Basal
expression of P2Y2 was relatively high in undifferentiated cells, and
expression declined during granulocytic differentiation. P2Y2 expression
also decreased during monocytic differentiation and was nearly
undetectable after 48 hours.

Arthur et al. (2005) found that activation of P2ry2 by ATP-gamma-S, a
nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, in the presence of NGF (162030) led to
colocalization and association of Trka (NTRK1; 191315) and P2ry2 and was
required for enhanced neuronal differentiation in a rat neuronal
precursor cell line. Depletion of P2ry2 by genetic means or by small
interfering RNA abolished the ATP-gamma-S-mediated increase in neuronal
differentiation. Moreover, in vivo injection of ATP-gamma-S into the
sciatic nerve of wildtype mice, but not P2ry2-null mice, increased
expression of Gap43 (162060), a marker for axonal growth. Arthur et al.
(2005) concluded that P2RY2 is a morphogen receptor that potentiates
neurotrophin signaling in neuronal development and regeneration.

Chen et al. (2006) found that human neutrophils release ATP from the
leading edge of the cell surface to amplify chemotactic signals and
direct cell orientation by feedback through the P2Y2 nucleotide
receptors. Neutrophils rapidly hydrolyze released ATP to adenosine that
then acts via A3-type adenosine receptors, which are recruited to the
leading edge to promote cell migration. Thus, Chen et al. (2006) found
that ATP release and autocrine feedback through P2Y2 and A3 receptors
provide signal amplification, controlling gradient sensing and migration
of neutrophils.

Through several lines of evidence, Elliott et al. (2009) identified
extracellular nucleotides as a critical apoptotic cell 'find-me' signal.
Elliott et al. (2009) demonstrated the caspase (see 147678)-dependent
release of ATP and UTP in equimolar quantities during the early stages
of apoptosis by primary thymocytes and cell lines. Purified nucleotides
at these concentrations were sufficient to induce monocyte recruitment
comparable to that of apoptotic cell supernatants. Enzymatic removal of
ATP and UTP (by apyrase or the expression of ectopic CD39, 601752)
abrogated the ability of apoptotic cell supernatants to recruit
monocytes in vitro and in vivo. Elliott et al. (2009) then identified
the ATP/UTP receptor P2Y2 as a critical sensor of nucleotides released
by apoptotic cells using RNA interference-mediated depletion studies in
monocytes, and macrophages from P2Y2-null mice. The relevance of
nucleotides in apoptotic cell clearance in vivo was revealed by 2
approaches. First, in a murine air-pouch model, apoptotic cell
supernatants induced a 3-fold greater recruitment of monocytes and
macrophages than supernatants from healthy cells did; this recruitment
was abolished by depletion of nucleotides and was significantly
decreased in P2Y2-null mice. Second, clearance of apoptotic thymocytes
was significantly impaired by either depletion of nucleotides or
interference with P2Y receptor function (by pharmacologic inhibition or
in P2Y2-null mice). Elliott et al. (2009) concluded that their results
identified nucleotides as a critical find-me cue released by apoptotic
cells to promote P2Y2-dependent recruitment of phagocytes, and provided
evidence for a clear relationship between a find-me signal and efficient
corpse clearance in vivo.

MAPPING

Using PCR analysis of human-rodent hybrid cell line DNAs, Dasari et al.
(1996) mapped the human P2RY2 gene to chromosome 11q13.5-q14.1. The
authors noted that several G protein-coupled receptor genes, namely the
beta adrenergic receptor, the angiotensin receptor-like-1, and the
muscarinic cholinergic receptor-1, have been localized to the same
region of chromosome 11. By sequence tagged site (STS) mapping using the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, Somers et
al. (1997) demonstrated that the P2RY2 gene maps within less than 4 cM
of the P2RY6 gene (602451), which they had mapped to 11q13.5 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization and STS mapping. This was the first
chromosomal clustering of this gene family to be described.

164009	TITLE *164009 NUCLEAR MITOTIC APPARATUS PROTEIN 1; NUMA1
NUMA1/RARA FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The NUMA protein was one of the first to be described as a cell
cycle-related protein based on a distinct immunofluorescent staining
pattern: in interphase, NUMA is present throughout the nucleus, and in
mitosis, it localizes to the spindle apparatus (Lydersen and Pettijohn,
1980). Some patients with autoimmune disease have antibodies directed
against the NUMA protein. The full-length NUMA cDNA (Compton et al.,
1992; Yang et al., 1992) predicts a protein with a calculated molecular
mass of about 237 kD, containing 2 globular domains separated by a
coiled-coil domain of 1,485 amino acids. Wong et al. (2006) stated that
the coiled-coil region of NUMA can form parallel coiled-coil dimers.

GENE FUNCTION

Using double-immunofluorescence experiments, Yang et al. (1992) found
that NUMA dissociated from condensing chromosomes during early prophase,
before the complete disintegration of the nuclear lamina. As mitosis
progressed, NUMA reassociated with telophase chromosomes. Compton et al.
(1992) found that NUMA associated with the spindle immediately upon
nuclear envelope breakdown and progressed down the spindle microtubules
to concentrate at the pericentrosomal region. At the completion of
anaphase, NUMA dissociated from spindle microtubules and was imported
into the regenerating nuclei through nuclear pores.

The guanosine triphosphatase Ran (601179) stimulates assembly of
microtubule asters and spindles in mitotic Xenopus egg extracts. A
carboxy-terminal region of NUMA, a nuclear protein required for
organizing mitotic spindle poles, mimics Ran's ability to induce asters
(Merdes et al., 1996). This NUMA fragment also specifically interacts
with the nuclear transport factor, importin-beta (602738). Wiese et al.
(2001) showed that importin-beta is an inhibitor of microtubule aster
assembly in Xenopus egg extracts and that Ran regulates the interaction
between importin-beta and NUMA. Importin-beta therefore links NUMA to
regulation by Ran. Wiese et al. (2001) concluded that this suggests that
similar mechanisms regulate nuclear import during interphase and spindle
assembly during mitosis.

Quintyne et al. (2005) described a process of centrosomal clustering
that prevented the formation of multipolar spindles in noncancer cells.
Noncancer cells needed to overcome this clustering mechanism to allow
multipolar spindles to form at a high frequency. The microtubule motor
cytoplasmic dynein (see 600112) was a critical part of this coalescing
machinery, and in some tumor cells overexpression of the spindle protein
NUMA interfered with dynein localization, promoting multipolarity.

Wong et al. (2006) stated that RAE1 (603343) also binds to microtubules
and that either lowering RAE1 levels or increasing NUMA levels results
in spindle abnormalities. They found that either simultaneous depletion
of RAE1 and NUMA levels or simultaneous overexpression of RAE1 and NUMA
levels rescued spindle bipolarity. RAE1 and NUMA formed a transient
complex during mitosis in HeLa cells, and the binding of RAE1 to NUMA
converted the NUMA dimer to a tetravalent crosslinker of microtubules.
RAE1 interacted with a GLEBS-like motif at the N-terminal end of the
coiled-coil domain of NUMA. Wong et al. (2006) concluded that a balance
of these 2 proteins is required for bipolar spindle formation.

Using in vivo skin-specific lentiviral RNA interference, Williams et al.
(2011) investigated spindle orientation regulation and provided direct
evidence that LGN (609245), NuMA, and dynactin (DCTN1; 601143) are
involved. In compromising asymmetric cell divisions, Williams et al.
(2011) uncovered profound defects in stratification, differentiation,
and barrier formation, and implicated Notch (190198) signaling as an
important effector. Williams et al. (2011) concluded that asymmetric
cell division components act by reorientating mitotic spindles to
achieve perpendicular divisions, which in turn promote stratification
and differentiation. Furthermore, the resemblance between their
knockdown phenotypes and Rbpj (147183) loss-of-function mutants provided
important clues that suprabasal Notch signaling is impaired when
asymmetric cell divisions do not occur.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Sparks et al. (1993) demonstrated
that the NUMA1 gene is present in single copy and located on chromosome
11q13.

CYTOGENETICS

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; 612376) is uniquely associated with
chromosomal translocations that disrupt the gene encoding the retinoic
acid receptor, RARA (180240). In more than 99% of cases, this disruption
results in the formation of a fusion of the RARA gene with the PML gene
(102578). In rare variants of APL, the RARA gene has been found to be
fused to 1 of 2 other genes, PLZF (176797) and NPM (164040). Although
RARA dysregulation is evidently important in APL, the role of the
various fusion partners is unclear. Wells et al. (1997) characterized a
fourth APL gene fusion, which linked exons encoding the retinoic acid
and DNA-binding domains of RARA to 5-prime exons of NUMA1. The NUMA/RARA
fusion protein existed in sheet-like nuclear aggregates with which
normal NUMA partly colocalized. In contrast to t(15;17) APL (the usual
variety) the intracellular distribution of PML was normal in these
cells. Wells et al. (1997) suggested that interference with retinoid
signaling, and not disruption of PML organization, is essential to the
APL phenotype. Their work implicated for the first time an element of
the mitotic apparatus in the molecular pathogenesis of human malignancy.
The proband of their study was a Caucasian male first seen at 6 months
of age for investigation of multiple cutaneous lesions. Despite this
unusual clinical presentation, peripheral blood morphology and
cell-surface immunophenotype were typical of APL. Routine analysis of
diagnostic bone marrow revealed a clonal cytogenetic abnormality,
t(11;17)(q13;q21). The patient was treated with all-trans retinoic acid
and achieved complete remission; he remained in morphologic remission 38
months after autologous bone marrow transplantation.

610501	TITLE *610501 NEUROBLASTOMA BREAKPOINT FAMILY, MEMBER 1; NBPF1
;;KIAA1693
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The NBPF gene family, of which NBPF1 is the founding member, consists of
22 genes and pseudogenes that arose by gene duplication. NBPF genes
contain numerous low-copy repetitive elements and show high intergenic
and intragenic sequence identity in coding and noncoding regions
(Vandepoele et al., 2005).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned NBPF1, which they designated
KIAA1693. The transcript contains repetitive elements in its 3-prime
UTR, and the deduced protein contains 901 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected high expression in all tissues examined except for low
expression in kidney.

By analyzing the breakpoints of a t(1;17)(p36.2;q11.2) constitutional
translocation in a neuroblastoma (see 256700) patient, followed by PCR
of a mammary gland cDNA library, Vandepoele et al. (2005) cloned NBPF1,
which encodes a deduced 1,213-amino acid protein with a calculated
molecular mass of 139 kD. Vandepoele et al. (2005) also identified an
NBPF1 variant that lacks exon 1. In silico and RT-PCR analysis indicated
ubiquitous expression of a group of NBPF genes, including NBPF1.
Fluorescence- or epitope-tagged NBPF1 expressed in breast carcinoma
cells showed reticulate cytoplasmic staining.

GENE FAMILY

By genomic database analysis, Vandepoele et al. (2005) identified a
total of 22 NBPF genes and pseudogenes, located primarily in regions of
segmental duplication, including 1p36, 1p12, and 1q21.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vandepoele et al. (2005) determined that the NBPF1 gene contains 25
coding exons, several of which are internally duplicated.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the NBPF1 gene
to chromosome 1.

By genomic sequence analysis and FISH, Vandepoele et al. (2005) mapped
the NBPF1 gene to an NBPF gene cluster on chromosome 1p36. Genomic
sequence analysis predicted the presence of NBPF1 pseudogenes on
chromosomes 3p and 5q.

POPULATION GENETICS

By analyzing short-read mapping depth for 159 human genomes, Sudmant et
al. (2010) demonstrated accurate estimation of absolute copy number for
duplications as small as 1.9 kb pairs, ranging from 0 to 48 copies.
Sudmant et al. (2010) identified 4.1 million 'singly unique nucleotide'
positions informative in distinguishing specific copies and used them to
genotype the copy and content of specific paralogs within highly
duplicated gene families. These data identified human-specific
expansions in genes associated with brain development, such as GPRIN2
(611240) and SRGAP2 (606524), which have been implicated in neurite
outgrowth and branching. Also included were the brain-specific HYDIN2
gene (610813), associated with micro- and macrocephaly; DRD5 (126453), a
dopamine D5 receptor; and the GTF2I (601679) transcription factors,
whose deletion has been associated with visual-spatial and sociability
deficits among Williams-Beuren syndrome (194050) patients, among others.
The data of Sudmant et al. (2010) also revealed extensive population
genetic diversity, especially among the genes NPEPPS (606793), UGT2B17
(601903), and NBPF1, as well as LILRA3 (604818), which is the most
highly stratified gene by copy number in the human genome. In addition,
Sudmant et al. (2010) detected signatures consistent with gene
conversion in the human species.

EVOLUTION

Vandepoele et al. (2005) detected orthologs of NBPF family genes in
canine and bovine genomes but not in the genomes of fruit fly, nematode,
mouse, or rat. Duplication of the NBPF genes was found only in primates
and resulted in species-specific arrays of NBPF homologous sequences.

602013	TITLE *602013 POLYMERASE II, RNA, SUBUNIT G; POLR2G
;;RPB7, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION RNA polymerase II is the enzymatic complex responsible for transcription
of genes that result in mRNA production. For general information on the
structure and function of RNA polymerase II, see 180660.

CLONING

Schoen et al. (1997) stated that 7 of the RNA polymerase II complex
genes had been isolated and assigned to chromosomal sites. The complete
genomic sequence had been reported for only the 220-kD (POLR2A; 180660)
and 14.5-kD (POLR2I; 180662) subunits. Schoen et al. (1997) cloned,
sequenced, and mapped the seventh subunit of the RNA polymerase II
complex, which they designated hsRPB7. Southern blots of genomic and
cloned DNA suggested that it is encoded by a single gene. The sequence
of the 5-prime flanking region did not contain a TATA element, but did
contain several Sp1-binding sites, an AP-1 site, and a novel inverted
polymorphic GATA tandem repeat. Schoen et al. (1997) stated that this
novel GATA repeat should be useful for linkage analysis. The gene seemed
to be highly conserved among eukaryotic species, showing general
sequence conservation with yeast and Drosophila. Northern blot analysis
revealed a high degree of tissue-specific expression. Expression was
relatively high in adult retina, brain, and kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

The POLR2G gene consists of 8 exons and spans approximately 5.1 kb
(Schoen et al., 1997).

GENE FUNCTION

Khazak et al. (1998) demonstrated that POLR2D (606017) associates
strongly and specifically with POLR2G in the nuclei of human cells. The
association appeared to require sequences spanning the N-terminal half
of the POLR2D protein, whereas no truncation of POLR2G was observed to
associate with POLR2D.

MAPPING

Using human radiation hybrids and YACs, Schoen et al. (1997) localized
the POLR2G gene to 11q13.1, within 70 kb of marker D11S1765.

608668	TITLE *608668 ZINC FINGER MYND DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 11; ZMYND11
;;BS69
BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED MOLECULE 1, INCLUDED;
BRAM1, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using adenovirus E1A as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a 16-day
whole mouse embryo cDNA library, followed by screening a human colon
carcinoma cDNA library, Hateboer et al. (1995) cloned ZMYND11, which
they called BS69. The deduced 562-amino acid protein had an apparent
molecular mass of about 69 kD following in vitro transcription and
translation. BS69 contains 2 N-terminal zinc finger motifs, followed by
a nuclear localization signal and a C-terminal E1A-binding domain.
Northern blot analysis detected a 4.7-kb transcript in all mouse tissues
examined, with highest expression in kidney.

Using the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of mouse Bmpr1a (601299)
as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human placenta cDNA library,
followed by screening a kidney cDNA library and 5-prime RACE, Kurozumi
et al. (1998) cloned a splice variant of BS69 that they designated
BRAM1. The deduced BRAM1 protein contains the C-terminal 186 amino acids
of BS69 preceded by 12 amino acids unique to BRAM1. Northern blot
analysis detected variable expression of 4.4-kb and 1.3-kb transcripts
in all tissues examined. Following transfection in mouse fibroblasts,
BRAM1 localized to the cytoplasm, whereas BS69 localized to the nucleus.

Masselink and Bernards (2000) noted that BS69 contains 3 motifs involved
in transcription regulation: a PHD finger and bromodomain in its
N-terminal half, and a MYND domain at its extreme C terminus. The MYND
domain, which is also present in the BRAM1 variant, is a 2-zinc finger
motif first identified in Drosophila Deaf1 (602635) and human MTG8
(133435).

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation, Hateboer et al. (1995) confirmed direct
interaction between BS69 and the 289-amino acid isoform of E1A (289R)
following cotransfection in a human cell line; BS69 did not interact
with the shorter 243R E1A isoform. Endogenous BS69 complexed with E1A in
adenovirus-transformed human embryonic kidney cells. C-terminal deletion
mutants of BS69 failed to interact with E1A. BS69 inhibited
transactivation mediated by the 289R E1A protein, but not the 243R E1A
protein. BS69 also suppressed E1A-stimulated transcription of retinoic
acid receptor (see 180240) in COS cells.

Kurozumi et al. (1998) determined that BRAM1 interacts specifically with
the kinase domain of BMPR1A. BS69 did not interact with BMPR1A,
suggesting that the N terminus of BS69 interferes with this interaction.
Further investigation indicated that BRAM1 also interacts with TAB1
(602615). Kurozumi et al. (1998) hypothesized that a ternary complex of
MBPR1A, TAB1, and BRAM1 may be involved in BMP-TAB1-TAK1 (601426)
signaling.

Masselink and Bernards (2000) determined that full transcriptional
repression by BS69 requires the MYND domain. BS69 and BRAM1 interacted
with NCOR (600849) through the MYND domain, but BRAM1 was unable to
repress transcription, indicating that NCOR interaction is necessary but
not sufficient for BS69 repression. Expression of E1A inhibited
repression mediated by BS69.

Ansieau and Leutz (2002) showed that the MYND domain of BS69 interacts
with a conserved PxLxP motif in E1A, the Epstein-Barr virus oncoprotein
EBNA2, and a MYC (190080)-related cellular protein, MGA. The viral
proteins competed with MGA for BS69 binding in a PxLxP-dependent
fashion.

MAPPING

By FISH, Masselink and Bernards (2000) mapped the ZMYND11 gene to
chromosome 10p14.

610447	TITLE *610447 SHADOW OF PRION PROTEIN; SPRN
;;SHADOO;;
SHO
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching for zebrafish prion protein (PrP; 176640)
homologs, Premzl et al. (2003) identified, and subsequently cloned, a
novel zebrafish cDNA, SPRN (shadow of PrP), encoding a protein
designated shadoo (Sho). Further database searches revealed
well-conserved orthologs in other fish (Fugu and tetraodon) and in
mammals (human, mouse, and rat) (Premzl et al., 2003, 2004). The deduced
human protein contains 151 amino acids (Premzl et al., 2003). The
mammalian proteins share 81 to 95% sequence identity. Alignment of all
fish and mammalian Sho proteins showed that all have an N-terminal
peptide sequence with an endoplasmic reticulum targeting signal for
extracellular transport, a basic RG-rich region, a hydrophobic stretch
in the middle of the protein that contains the same unusual composition
of small aliphatic residues (GAV) as PrP and PrP-like proteins, and a
C-terminal region with a putative N-glycosylation site and a possible
GPI anchor site (Premzl et al., 2003, 2004). Database searches revealed
that SPRN is expressed in mouse and rat embryo, brain, and retina, in
human hippocampus, and in zebrafish embryo and retina. Using RT-PCR,
Premzl et al. (2003) confirmed SPRN expression in human, rat, and mouse
brain. RT-PCR of rat cDNA from multiple tissues indicated that SPRN is
almost exclusively expressed in brain, with faint expression in lung and
stomach. Phylogenetic footprinting on aligned human, mouse, and Fugu
SPRN genes detected 16 conserved motifs, 3 of which are known
transcription factor-binding sites for a receptor and transcription
factors specific to or associated with expression in the brain (Premzl
et al., 2004), suggesting an important function in this tissue.

EVOLUTION

Premzl et al. (2003, 2004) found that conservation of the SPRN-coding
exon between mammals and fish satisfied the criteria for gene orthology.
They noted that the gene order and orientation of SPRN and 2 proximal
genes, an amine oxidase and a GTP-binding protein (MTG1), indicated that
no rearrangement occurred in this genomic fragment after the
evolutionary divergence of mammals and fish 450 million years ago.

Premzl et al. (2004) found that the gene density and GC content are much
higher in the SPRN genomic environment than in the PRNP (PrP)
environment. In addition, in contrast to genes encoding members of the
PrP family, SPRN contains no transposable elements. Premzl et al. (2004)
suggested that this may be the result of functional selection.

GENE STRUCTURE

Premzl et al. (2003) determined that the zebrafish, mouse, and human
SPRN genes all contain 2 exons, with the ORF contained entirely within
exon 2.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Premzl et al. (2003) mapped the human SPRN gene to
chromosome 10q26.3 and the mouse gene to chromosome 7. Premzl et al.
(2004) found an apparent duplication of the human SPRN gene about 140 kb
downstream of SPRN.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Beck et al. (2008) presented evidence that variation in the SPRN gene
may be associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD; 123400). Two of
107 patients with variant CJD were found to have a 1-bp insertion in the
SPRN gene, which was not identified in 861 controls (p = 0.01). The 1-bp
insertion in codon 46 was predicted to result in frameshift and a
putative 294-amino acid protein if translation occurred; however, the
authors were unable to show whether the transcript exists. In addition,
2 linked SNPs, -11A-G and 20T-C, in the SPRN gene were associated with
risk of sporadic CJD (p = 0.009). The findings supported the hypothesis
that SPRN variants may be involved in prion disease.

601365	TITLE *601365 DISHEVELLED 1; DVL1
;;DSH, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; DVL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Drosophila dishevelled gene (dsh) encodes a cytoplasmic
phosphoprotein (Klingensmith et al., 1994) that regulates cell
proliferation, acting as a transducer molecule for developmental
processes, including segmentation and neuroblast specification. Pizzuti
et al. (1996) noted that dsh is required for the function of the
wingless gene product wg, a segment polarity gene homologous to the
mammalian protooncogene WNT1 (164820). Pizzuti et al. (1996) used
oligonucleotides corresponding to the mouse dishevelled homolog (Dvl1)
to isolate cDNA clones from a human fetal brain cDNA library and human
adult caudate cDNA library. One human cDNA clone, designated DVL1 by
them, encodes a 670-amino acid polypeptide that had 92% overall identity
to the mouse Dvl1 protein (99% homology in the N-terminal half and 84%
identity in the C-terminal half). By Northern blot analysis of poly(A)
mRNA Pizzuti et al. (1996) observed a transcription product of
approximately 2.9 kb with maximal expression in adult skeletal muscle
and pancreas and abundant expression in heart muscle relative to a
control transcript. Detectable levels were also found in adult brain,
placenta, lung, liver, and kidney. The same expression patterns were
found in fetal tissues. DVL1 expression was detected in the human neural
tube (particularly in the dorsal portions) by in situ hybridization.
DVL1 shares approximately 64% amino acid identity with DVL3 (601368).
Pizzuti et al. (1996) concluded that the high level of homology in the
N-terminal regions of these proteins indicates that the N-terminal
regions encode essential domains for the whole class of dishevelled
proteins, while the sequence divergence in the C-terminal half suggests
that these regions contain domains which are responsible for specific
single-molecule (i.e., DVL1 or DVL3) activity. They noted that 1 domain
of DVL1 shows homology to the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor
gene dgl1 (601014).

Semenov and Snyder (1997) cloned and characterized 3 human homologs of
dishevelled, thereby showing that these genes form a multigene family in
humans. The cDNA sequence of DVL1 reported by Semenov and Snyder (1997)
differs from that previously reported by Pizzuti et al. (1996). They
also demonstrated that one of the human dishevelled homologs, DVL2
(602151), is a phosphoprotein, raising the possibility that the
mechanisms of dishevelled function in Wnt signaling are likely to be
conserved among metazoans.

GENE FUNCTION

Wallingford et al. (2000) used time-lapse confocal microscopy to
demonstrate that the failure of cells lacking Xenopus dishevelled
function to undergo convergent extension results from defects in cell
polarity. Furthermore, Xenopus dishevelled mutations that inhibit
convergent extension correspond to mutations in Drosophila dishevelled
that selectively perturb planar cell polarity. Wallingford et al. (2000)
concluded that polarized cell behavior is essential for convergent
extension and is controlled by vertebrate dishevelled. Thus, a
vertebrate equivalent of the Drosophila planar cell polarity signaling
cascade may be required for normal gastrulation.

Luo et al. (2002) found that Dvl1 interacted with Musk (601296) in a
mouse muscle cell line and in HEK293 cells transfected with mouse
constructs. They determined that Dvl1 was expressed at a high level
during development of embryonic mouse skeletal muscle, in a pattern that
was similar to that of Musk, but expression decreased as development
progressed. They further demonstrated that the Musk-Dvl1 interaction
regulated acetylcholine receptor (see 100690) clustering stimulated by
agrin (103320), and a mutant form of Dvl that did not interact with Musk
inhibited the ability of agrin to induce receptor clustering.

From results of coimmunoprecipitation experiments, confocal microscopy
analysis, and study of deletion mutants, Park and Moon (2002) concluded
that the Dsh protein interacts with stbm, the zebrafish and Xenopus
homolog of VANGL2 (600533).

Rosso et al. (2005) examined expression of endogenous Dvl1 in mouse
hippocampal neurons and found Dvl1 localized in dendrites and axons,
where it was associated with microtubules, and accumulated in actin-rich
regions. Overexpression of Dvl1 increased dendritic branching in
cultured hippocampal neurons, similar to the effect of Wnt7b (601967)
overexpression, and branching was blocked by Sfrp1 (604156), a secreted
Wnt antagonist. Conversely, hippocampal neurons from mice lacking Dvl1
showed reduced dendritic arborization. Analysis of downstream events
showed that Wnt7b and Dvl1 regulate dendritic development through a
noncanonical Wnt pathway by activating Rac (see 602048) and JNK (see
601158).

Dollar et al. (2005) demonstrated that a vertebrate homolog of Lgl
(600966) associates with dishevelled, an essential mediator of Wnt
signaling, and that dishevelled regulates the localization of Lgl in
Xenopus ectoderm and Drosophila follicular epithelium. Dollar et al.
(2005) showed that both Lgl and Dsh are required for normal apical-basal
polarity of Xenopus ectodermal cells. In addition, Dollar et al. (2005)
showed that the Wnt receptor frizzled-8 (606146), but not frizzled-7
(603410), causes Lgl to dissociate from the cortex with the concomitant
loss of its activity in vivo. Dollar et al. (2005) concluded that their
findings suggest a molecular basis for the regulation of cell polarity
by frizzled and dishevelled.

Park et al. (2006) identified Dsh and Frodo (DACT1; 607861) as upstream
regulators of the p120-catenin (CTNND1; 601045)/Kaiso (300329) signaling
pathway in Xenopus.

Using live imaging of vertebrate cells, Bilic et al. (2007) demonstrated
that the scaffold protein dishevelled (DVL) is required for LRP6
(603507) phosphorylation and aggregation following WNT treatment. Bilic
et al. (2007) proposed that WNTs induce coclustering of receptors and
DVL in LRP6 signalosomes, which in turn triggers LRP6 phosphorylation to
promote Axin (603816) recruitment and beta-catenin (see 116806)
stabilization.

Zhang et al. (2007) found that downregulation of Dvl abrogated axon
differentiation in cultured embryonic rat hippocampal neurons, whereas
overexpression of Dvl resulted in multiple axon formation. A complex of
PAR3 (PARD3; 606745), PAR6 (PARD6A; 607484), and an atypical protein
kinase C (aPKC), such as PKC-zeta (PRKCZ; 176982), is required for
axon-dendrite differentiation, and Zhang et al. (2007) found that Dvl
associated with Pkc-zeta in rat brain and transfected human embryonic
kidney cells. The interaction of Dvl with Pkc-zeta resulted in
stabilization and activation of Pkc-zeta. Expression of
dominant-negative Pkc-zeta attenuated multiple axon formation due to Dvl
overexpression in neurons, and overexpression of Pkc-zeta prevented axon
loss due to Dvl downregulation. Wnt5a (164975), a noncanonical Wnt,
activated Pkc-zeta and promoted axon differentiation, and downregulation
of Dvl or inhibition of Pkc-zeta attenuated the Wnt5a effect on axon
differentiation. Zhang et al. (2007) concluded that WNT5A and DVL
promote axon differentiation mediated by the PAR3-PAR6-aPKC complex.

Mutations in the LRRK2 gene (609007) are the most common known cause of
Parkinson disease (see PARK8; 607060). Sancho et al. (2009) reported
interaction of LRRK2 with the dishevelled family of phosphoproteins
DVL1, DVL2 (602151), and DVL3 (601368). The LRRK2 Roc-COR domain and the
DVL1 DEP domain were necessary and sufficient for LRRK2-DVL1
interaction. Coexpression of DVL1 increased LRRK2 steady-state protein
levels, an effect that was dependent on the DEP domain. LRRK2-DVL1-3
interactions were disrupted by the familial LRRK2 Y1699C mutation
(609007.0002), whereas pathogenic mutations at residues arg1441 (see,
e.g., 609007.0001) and arg1728 strengthened LRRK2-DVL1 interactions.
Coexpression of DVL1 with LRRK2 in mammalian cells resulted in the
redistribution of LRRK2 to typical cytoplasmic DVL1 aggregates in HEK293
and SH-SY5Y cells and colocalization in neurites and growth cones of
differentiated dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells. Since the DVL1 DEP domain is
known to be involved in the regulation of small GTPases, Sancho et al.
(2009) proposed that DVLs may influence LRRK2 GTPase activity, and that
Roc-COR domain mutations modulating LRRK2-DVL interactions indirectly
influence kinase activity.

MAPPING

By analysis of a panel of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids by PCR with
primers for the DVL1 3-prime untranslated region, Pizzuti et al. (1996)
mapped the DVL1 gene to human chromosome 1. They used fluorescence in
situ hybridization with cloned cDNAs to map the DVL1 gene to chromosome
1p36. Pizzuti et al. (1996) noted that the region of DVL1 that shows
homology to the Drosophila tumor suppressor gene dgl1, as well as its
possible role as a neural differentiation factor, would make it a
candidate gene for neuroblastomatous transformation (see also 256700,
the 1p36-linked neuroblastoma locus). The Schwartz-Jampel syndrome
(255800) has been mapped to chromosome 1p36-p34 and Pizzuti et al.
(1996) suggested that the phenotype of this disease is consistent with
defects which might be expected from aberrant expression of a DVL gene
during development. They noted also that Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
type 2A (118210) has been mapped to 1p36-1p35 and that the main
pathologic feature of this disorder is a motor neuron axonal
degeneration. See also the dishevelled-like locus that maps to the
DiGeorge critical region on chromosome 22q11 (601225).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bedell et al. (1996) characterized the region of deletion in a patient
with the 1p36 deletion syndrome (607872) whose karyotype was 46,XY,
del(1)(p36.3). They identified the dishevelled gene within the deleted
region. The authors speculated that this gene may play a role in the
pathogenesis of the observed syndrome through haploinsufficiency or
through genomic imprinting, which had been reported previously for this
region of chromosome 1 by Caron et al. (1995).

EVOLUTION

Human evolution is characterized by a dramatic increase in brain size
and complexity. To probe its genetic basis, Dorus et al. (2004) examined
the evolution of genes involved in diverse aspects of nervous system
biology. These genes, including DVL1, displayed significantly higher
rates of protein evolution in primates than in rodents. This trend was
most pronounced for the subset of genes implicated in nervous system
development. Moreover, within primates, the acceleration of protein
evolution was most prominent in the lineage leading from ancestral
primates to humans. Dorus et al. (2004) concluded that the phenotypic
evolution of the human nervous system has a salient molecular correlate,
i.e., accelerated evolution of the underlying genes, particularly those
linked to nervous system development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lijam et al. (1997) created Dvl1-null mice by gene targeting.
Dvl1-deficient mice are viable, fertile, and structurally normal.
However, these mice exhibited reduced social interaction, manifested as
decreased whisker trimming, deficits in nest building, less huddling
contact during sleep, and subordinate responses in a social dominance
test. Sensorimotor gating was abnormal, as measured by deficits in
prepulse inhibition of acoustic and tactile startle. Since reduced
social interaction and abnormal sensorimotor gating are features of
several human neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, Lijam
et al. (1997) suggested that Dvl1-deficient mice may provide a model for
aspects of these disorders. Lijam et al. (1997) concluded that these
results were consistent with an interpretation that common genetic
mechanisms underlie abnormal social behavior and implicated Dvl1 in
processes underlying complex behaviors.

601175	TITLE *601175 ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR-LIKE 2; ARL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The ARFs are small GTP-binding proteins of the RAS superfamily (see
ARF1, 103180). Clark et al. (1993) used degenerate PCR to clone human
ARL2, a member of a functionally distinct group of ARF-like genes. ARL2
encodes a 184-amino acid predicted protein that is 76% identical to ARF1
and about 40 to 45% identical to the Drosophila ARL proteins. Northern
blot analysis suggested ubiquitous transcription.

By immunohistochemical analysis of several mammalian cell lines,
including human, Zhou et al. (2006) found that ARL2 was expressed at
centrosomes, in cytoplasmic punctae, and in the nucleus. ARL2 localized
to centrosomes throughout the cell cycle, and its expression in other
structures was cell type specific.

GENE FUNCTION

Clark et al. (1993) found that recombinant ARL2 bound GTP rapidly.
However, guanine nucleotide exchange did not require phospholipids, a
characteristic of ARF proteins.

Bowzard et al. (2007) showed that both human ELMOD1 (615456) and ELMOD2
(610196), but not other ELMO domain-containing proteins, had GAP
activity toward ARL2.

Zhou et al. (2006) stated that ARL2 and ARL3 (604695) arose from a
common ancestor early in eukaryotic evolution and that they remain
highly related. However, they found that the 2 GTPases had distinct
effects on microtubule function in mammalian cells. Knockdown of ARL2 in
HeLa cells via RNA interference had little effect, but expression of
ARL2 with a dominant activating mutation caused failure of tubulin
polymerization, with loss of microtubules and microtubule-based mitotic
spindle, resulting in cell cycle arrest in M phase. In contrast,
knockdown of ARL3 using RNA interference changed HeLa cell morphology,
caused Golgi fragmentation, and increased acetylation of alpha-tubulin
(see 602259), which resulted in failure of cytokinesis and an elevated
number of binucleated cells. Overexpression of ARL3 had little effect.

The assembly of alpha/beta tubulin heterodimers requires the
participation of a series of chaperone proteins, some of which can
participate in the reverse microtubule-depolymerizing reaction. Using
HeLa cells, Tian et al. (2010) found that overexpression of the tubulin
chaperone TBCD (604649) caused microtubule depolymerization.
Coexpression of ARL2 inhibited microtubule depolymerization by
sequestering TBCD in an ARL2-TBCD interaction.

Using microarray analysis, quantitative PCR, and overexpression and
knockdown studies, Wang et al. (2011) found that binding of the microRNA
MIR16 (see 609704) to the 3-prime UTR of ARL2 caused downregulation of
ARL2 mRNA and protein expression in several human cell lines. MIR16
reduced proliferation and caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, at least in
part, through ARL2 downregulation. MIR16 also reduced cell migration,
but this effect was not mimicked by small interfering RNA directed
against ARL2.

Ismail et al. (2011) stated that PDE-delta (PDE6D; 602676) binds to
farnesylated small G proteins. They presented the 1.7-angstrom structure
of human PDE-delta in complex with C-terminally farnesylated human RHEB
(601293). PDE-delta interacted almost exclusively with the C-terminal
farnesyl moiety of RHEB, which was inserted within the farnesyl-binding
pocket of PDE-delta. The interaction did not require guanine nucleotide,
which bound RHEB on a surface nearly opposite to the PDE-delta-binding
site. PDE-delta also interacted with mouse Arl2. The interaction of
PDE-delta with Arl2 was dependent upon GTP and caused a conformational
change in PDE-delta that closed its farnesyl-binding pocket. In
solution, addition of Arl2-GTP dissociated the PDE-delta-farnesylated
RHEB complex. Addition of Arl3-GTP also caused release of farnesylated
RHEB from PDE-delta. In transfected canine kidney cells,
fluorescence-labeled RHEB showed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi
localization. Addition of PDE-delta relocalized RHEB into a cytoplasmic
and nuclear distribution, and subsequent addition of Arl2-GTP restored
RHEB localization to ER and Golgi membranes. Ismail et al. (2011)
concluded that PDE-delta functions as a solubilization factor for
farnesylated RHEB and that ARL2 and ARL3 act in a GTP-dependent manner
as allosteric release factors for farnesylated RHEB.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the ARL2 gene to chromosome 11q13.1 based on an
alignment of the ARL2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK L13687) with the genomic
sequence (GRCh37).

118510	TITLE *118510 CHOLINERGIC RECEPTOR, MUSCARINIC, 1; CHRM1
;;ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR, MUSCARINIC, 1
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FAMILY

Goyal (1989) stated that 5 distinct but related muscarinic receptors had
been identified, with apparent molecular masses ranging from 51,452 to
66,127 kD. These glycosylated proteins have single chains of 460 to 590
amino acids that are thought to span the plasma membrane 7 times,
creating 4 extracellular domains, 7 helical hydrophobic transmembrane
domains, and 4 intracellular domains. Each protein is the product of a
different gene without introns in the coding sequence, and the amino
acid sequences in the receptor subtypes are remarkably homologous among
different animal species (Bonner et al., 1987; Peralta et al., 1987;
Bonner et al., 1988; Liao et al., 1989). The nomenclature is confusing
(Eglen and Whiting, 1986; Goyal, 1989). In structure and evolution,
muscarinic receptors are quite distinct from their pharmacologic kin,
the nicotinic receptors (see 100690, 100710, 100720, 100730).

MAPPING

By means of analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by both isotopic and
nonisotopic in situ hybridization, Bonner et al. (1991) assigned the
CHRM1 gene to 11q12-q13.

Courseaux et al. (1996) used a combination of methods to refine maps of
an approximately 5-Mb region of 11q13. They proposed the following gene
order:
cen--PGA--FTH1--UGB--AHNAK--ROM1--MDU1--CHRM1--COX8--EMK1--FKBP2--PLCB3--[PYGM,
ZFM1]--FAU--CAPN1--[MLK3, RELA]--FOSL1--SEA--CFL1--tel.

GENE FUNCTION

Cholinergic modulation of hippocampal and cortical function plays an
important role in memory and attention. The m1 muscarinic ACh receptor
is abundant in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Using pharmacologic
agents in rats, Marino et al. (1998) showed that the m1 receptor
modulates NMDA receptor-meditated excitatory synaptic transmission in
hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells.

Dean et al. (2002) tested the hypothesis that muscarinic receptors are
involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia by measuring CHRM1 and
CHRM4 (118495) protein and mRNA as well as [3H]pirenzepine binding in
Brodmann's area (BA) 9 and 40 obtained postmortem from 20 schizophrenic
and 20 age/sex-matched control subjects. They observed a significant
decrease in [3H]pirenzepine binding to BA 9 (p less than 0.02) but not
BA 40 from subjects with schizophrenia. The level of CHRM1 protein (p
less than 0.01) but not CHRM4 protein was decreased in BA 9 from
schizophrenic subjects but neither protein was altered in BA 40. The
level of CHRM1 mRNA was decreased in BA 9 (p less than 0.01) and BA 40
(p less than 0.01) from schizophrenic subjects, but CHRM4 mRNA was
decreased only in BA 40 (p less than 0.005). Dean et al. (2002)
interpreted the data as indicating that CHRM1 changes in the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may have a role in the pathology of
schizophrenia.

Seven-transmembrane receptor signaling is transduced by second
messengers such as diacylglycerol (DAG) generated in response to the
heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(q) (600998) and is
terminated by receptor desensitization and degradation of the second
messengers. Nelson et al. (2007) showed that beta-arrestins (see 107940)
coordinate both processes for the G(q)-coupled M1 muscarinic receptor
(CHRM1). Beta-arrestins physically interact with diacylglycerol kinases
(see 125855), enzymes that degrade DAG. Moreover, beta-arrestins are
essential for conversion of DAG to phosphatidic acid after agonist
stimulation, and this activity requires recruitment of the
beta-arrestin-DGK complex to activated 7-transmembrane receptors. The
dual function of beta-arrestins, limiting production of diacylglycerol
(by receptor desensitization) while enhancing its rate of degradation,
is analogous to their ability to recruit adenosine
3-prime,5-prime-monophosphate phosphodiesterases to G(s)
(139320)-coupled beta-2-adrenergic receptors (ADRB2; 109690). Thus,
Nelson et al. (2007) concluded that beta-arrestins can serve similar
regulatory functions for disparate classes of 7-transmembrane receptors
through structurally dissimilar enzymes that degrade chemically distinct
second messengers.

Knox et al. (2010) hypothesized that parasympathetic innervation is
required for epithelial progenitor cell function during organogenesis.
Removal of the parasympathetic ganglion in mouse explant organ culture
decreased the number and morphogenesis of keratin 5 (148040)-positive
epithelial progenitor cells. These effects were rescued with an
acetylcholine analog. Knox et al. (2010) demonstrated that acetylcholine
signaling, via the muscarinic M1 receptor and epidermal growth factor
receptor (131550), increased epithelial morphogenesis and proliferation
of the keratin 5-positive progenitor cells. Parasympathetic innervation
maintained the epithelial progenitor cell population in an
undifferentiated state, which was required for organogenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Anagnostaras et al. (2003) found that m1-null mice (m1 -/-) showed
normal or enhanced memory for tasks that involved matching-to-sample
problems and are hippocampus-dependent. In contrast, the null mice were
severely impaired in non-matching-to-sample tasks, working memory, and
consolidation, which require the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex.
The results suggested that the m1 receptor is involved in memory
processes in which the cortex and hippocampus interact.

603698	TITLE *603698 GOLGI-SPECIFIC BREFELDIN-A RESISTANCE FACTOR 1; GBF1
DESCRIPTION Members of the Sec7 domain family share a conserved region that forms a
catalytic fold with guanine nucleotide exchange activity. In vitro, the
Sec7 domain of several proteins catalyzes the activation of
ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs; see 103180), suggesting that members of
the Sec7 domain family represent specific guanine nucleotide exchange
factors for the ARF GTPase family. Nagase et al. (1996) isolated
KIAA0248, a partial cDNA from immature myeloid cells encoding a protein
with homology to S. cerevisiae Sec7. Using 5-prime RACE, Mansour et al.
(1998) isolated a cDNA corresponding to the remainder of the coding
sequence. They designated the gene GBF1 (Golgi-specific brefeldin A
resistance factor-1). The predicted 1,859-amino acid protein has a pI of
5.55 and contains a Sec7 domain and a proline-rich C terminus. A 7-kb
GBF1 mRNA was expressed in all tissues tested by Northern blot analysis.

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Mansour et al. (1998) mapped the GBF1 gene to 10q24.
Another Sec7 domain family member, PSD (602327), maps to the same
region.

608684	TITLE *608684 NINEIN; NIN
;;GSK3B-INTERACTING PROTEIN;;
KIAA1565
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ninein is a centrosomal protein required for the centrosome to function
as a microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and is essential for the
reformation of the interphase centrosome architecture following mitosis
(Ou et al., 2002).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned NIN, which they designated
KIAA1565. RT-PCR ELISA detected high NIN expression in ovary, spleen,
adult whole brain, and all individual brain regions examined. Expression
was intermediate in all other adult and fetal tissues examined except
testis, which showed no expression.

Using GSK3B (605004) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a fetal liver
cDNA library, followed by EST contig searching and 5-prime RACE of fetal
liver cDNA, Hong et al. (2000) cloned full-length NIN. The deduced
2,047-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 239 kD. NIN
contains an N-terminal GTP-binding site, a large coiled-coil domain with
4 leucine zipper motifs, and a C-terminal domain responsible for GSK
binding. Unlike mouse Nin, it does not have an N-terminal Ca(2+)-binding
site. Northern blot analysis detected a 9.0-kb transcript in all tissues
examined and a 7.0-kb transcript predominantly in heart and skeletal
muscle. Fluorescence-labeled NIN localized in the perinuclear foci
characteristic of centrosomes in transfected COS-1 cells.

Hong et al. (2000) cloned a splice variant of NIN, which they designated
ninein-lm (ninein like mouse) because the protein contains an N-terminal
Ca(2+)-binding site. This variant lacks intron 1 and utilizes an
alternate splice site in exon 2 that results in more 5-prime sequence of
exon 2. Ninein-lm encodes a deduced 2,041-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of 238 kD. RT-PCR and Southern blot analysis
indicated that ninein-lm expression was 20- to 50-fold higher than
ninein expression in all tissues tested except pancreas.

By Western blot analysis, Chen et al. (2003) determined that endogenous
HeLa cell ninein had an apparent molecular mass of about 230 kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hong et al. (2000) determined that the NIN gene contains 29 exons and
spans about 130 kb. The promoter region contains a TATA box, 2 CCAAT
boxes, and 3 GC boxes. It also has 4 Sp1 (189906)-binding sites, 2 p300
(602700)-binding sites, and 1 AP1 (165160)-binding site.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and radiation hybrid analysis, Hong et al.
(2000) mapped the NIN gene to chromosome 14q22.

GENE FUNCTION

Hong et al. (2000) determined that the C termini of ninein and ninein-lm
bound GSK3B. The coiled-coil domain, but not the leucine-zipper domains,
mediated the interaction. The coiled-coil domain also mediated
oligomerization.

The mammalian centrosome consists of a pair of centrioles surrounded by
pericentriolar material (PCM). Ou et al. (2002) stated that a subset of
PCM proteins are arranged in a tubular conformation with an open and a
closed end within the centrosome. They found that, in the mother
centrosome, ninein and CEP110 (605496) were distributed at both ends of
the centrosome tube, including the site of centrosome duplication.
However, in the daughter centrosome, ninein and CEP110 were present only
at the closed end, where they colocalized with CEP250. The appearance of
ninein and CEP110 at the open end of the daughter centrosome occurred
during the telophase-G1 transition of the next cell cycle, concomitant
with the maturation of the daughter centrosome into a mother centrosome.
Microinjection of antibodies against either ninein or CEP110 into
metaphase HeLa cells disrupted the reformation of the tubular
conformation of proteins within the centrosome following cell division
and led to dispersal of centrosomal material throughout the cytosol.
Microinjection of antibodies to either ninein or CEP110 into metaphase
kangaroo rat kidney cells not only disrupted the tubular configuration
within the centrosome, but also affected the centrosome's ability to
function as an MTOC. Centrosomal architecture was not disrupted if
antibodies were microinjected into postmitotic cells with fully formed
centrosomes, but the MTOC function of the centrosomes was disrupted.

Chen et al. (2003) showed that the coiled-coil II (CCII) domain of
ninein, which contains a centrosome targeting signal, colocalized with
gamma-tubulin (191135) and centrin (see CENT1 603187) at the centrosome
of transfected HeLa cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that
ninein protein disappeared from spindle poles during metaphase and
anaphase, but reaccumulated at centrosomes at the end of cell division.
In vitro kinase assays indicated that the CCII domain was readily
phosphorylated by AIK (AURKA; 603072) and PKA (see 176911).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 sisters with severe short stature, microcephaly, and developmental
delay (Seckel syndrome-7; SCKL7, 614851), Dauber et al. (2012)
identified compound heterozygosity for missense mutations in the NIN
gene, Q1222R (608684.0001) and N1709S (608684.0002).

ANIMAL MODEL

Dauber et al. (2012) performed morpholino knockdown of ninein in
zebrafish and observed defects in the anterior neuroectoderm that
resulted in a deformity of the developing cranium, with a small, squared
skull highly reminiscent of the human phenotype.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SECKEL SYNDROME 7
NIN, GLN1222ARG

In 2 sisters with severe short stature, microcephaly, and developmental
delay (SCKL7; 614851), Dauber et al. (2012) identified compound
heterozygosity for a 3667G-A transition in exon 18 of the NIN gene,
resulting in a gln1222-to-arg (Q1222R) substitution, and a 5128A-G
transition in exon 23, resulting in an asn1709-to-ser (N1709S;
608684.0002) substitution; both substitutions occurred at evolutionarily
conserved residues. The unaffected parents were each heterozygous for 1
of the mutations, neither of which was present in the SNP database or
the NHLBI exome variant server; however, the Q1222R variant was present
in the 1000 Genomes pilot data, with an overall minor allele frequency
of 0.001. Functional analysis of patient fibroblasts suggested that the
compound heterozygous NIN defects did not disrupt ninein expression or
localization or affect mitotic functions in an obvious way.

603637	TITLE *603637 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L27a; RPL27A
DESCRIPTION The mammalian ribosome is a macromolecular assembly of 4 RNA species
(see 180450) and approximately 80 different proteins.

By searching sequence databases with the partial sequences of randomly
selected cDNAs from a human colorectal cDNA library, Frigerio et al.
(1995) identified cDNAs encoding homologs of rat ribosomal proteins S5
(RPS5; 603630), S9 (RPS9; 603631), S10 (RPS10; 603632), S29 (RPS29;
603633), L5 (RPL5; 603634), L21 (RPL21; 603636), L27a (RPL27A), and L28
(RPL28; 603638). Frigerio et al. (1995) completed the cDNA sequences of
these human ribosomal proteins. The deduced 148-amino acid human RPL27A
differs from rat Rpl27a by 3 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
suggested variable expression of RPL27A in colorectal cancers compared
to adjacent normal tissues, although no correlation between the level of
expression and the severity of the disease was found.

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid mapping analyses, Kenmochi
et al. (1998) mapped the human RPL27A gene to 11p15. By FISH, Kusuda et
al. (1999) mapped the mouse Rpl27a gene to chromosome 7E2-F1, a region
that shows homology of synteny to human 11p15.

;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 262; ZNF262;;
KIAA0425
CELL DEATH-INHIBITING RNA, INCLUDED; CDIR, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1997) cloned ZNF262, which they designated
KIAA0425. The deduced protein contains 1,224 amino acids. RT-PCR
detected variable ZNF262 expression in all tissues examined, with
highest expression in kidney and lowest expression in spleen.

By searching an EST database for sequences encoding zinc finger-like
proteins, Smedley et al. (1999) identified ZNF262. The deduced protein
contains 5 tandem myeloproliferative and mental retardation (MYM)
motifs, conserved motifs that closely resemble zinc-binding sequences.
Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of several ZNF262
transcripts in all tissues examined, with highest expression in heart,
skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver.

By screening for cDNAs that inhibited interferon-gamma (147570)-induced
cell death in HeLa cells, Shchors et al. (2002) obtained a
441-nucleotide ZNF262 splice variant that they called CDIR. CDIR
contains only nucleotides 4,416 through 4,856 from the 3-prime UTR of
the full-length 6,108-nucleotide ZNF262 transcript. CDIR has a short ORF
encoding a putative 70-amino acid peptide and 14 stretches of 3 or more
consecutive U nucleobases characteristic of a U- or AU-rich element.

GENE FUNCTION

Shchors et al. (2002) showed that expression of CDIR in HeLa cells
inhibited interferon-gamma-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner.
Domain analysis revealed that only full-length CDIR, and not its
isolated 3-prime or 5-prime ends or ORF, confers resistance to cell
killing. Mutation analysis revealed that the U-rich motifs AUUUUC and
UUUCAUUUU are required for this protection. Resistance to cell killing
was accompanied by elevated levels of p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) and BCL2
(151430) mRNA and protein. In vitro RNA-protein binding assays and
Western blot analysis revealed that HSP27 (HSPB1; 602195) and all
isoforms of AUF1 (HNRNPD; 601324) are components of a protein complex
that binds CDIR. Use of recombinant proteins revealed that AUF1, but not
HSP27, directly bound CDIR. Transfection of HeLa cells with another AUF1
target, the 3-prime UTR of MYC (190080), also inhibited
interferon-gamma-induced cell killing, but in a limited manner. Shchors
et al. (2002) concluded that the antiapoptotic effect of CDIR is due to
the sequestration of AUF1 by CDIR, resulting in elevated levels and
activity of p21 and BCL2.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization and genomic sequence analysis,
Smedley et al. (1999) and Sohal et al. (1999) independently mapped the
ZNF262 gene to chromosome 1p34-p32.

602619	TITLE *602619 C-TERMINAL-BINDING PROTEIN 2; CTBP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The E1a region of group C adenoviruses encodes 2 nearly identical
proteins that are largely responsible for the oncogenic properties of
adenoviruses. The CTBP1 (602618) protein binds to the C-terminal half of
these E1A proteins. Katsanis and Fisher (1998) identified CTBP2 by
searching for expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with homology to CTBP1. The
predicted 445-amino acid CTBP2 protein is 72% identical to CTBP1.
Northern blot analysis showed that the CTBP2 gene was expressed as a
3.8-kb mRNA in all tissues tested, with the most abundant expression in
heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas.

Furusawa et al. (1999) identified the mouse homologs of CTBP1 and CTBP2
in a yeast 2-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with delta-EF1
(TCF8; 189909), a transcriptional repressor that binds the E2-box
(CACCTG) and related sequences. Using Northern blot analysis and in situ
hybridization with mouse embryos, Furusawa et al. (1999) detected
expression of 2 Ctbp2 transcripts confined to the embryonic stages.
Ctbp1 and Ctbp2 expression correlated with delta-EF1 expression.

Schmitz et al. (2000) identified an alternate product of the CTBP2
locus, which they named RIBEYE. They cloned full-length cDNAs
corresponding to RIBEYE in bovine, rat, and human. Human RIBEYE encodes
a deduced protein of 985 amino acids. Based on sequence analysis, the
authors defined a unique N-terminal A domain of RIBEYE and a C-terminal
B domain identical to the previously identified CTBP2. They found that
RIBEYE and CTBP2 are transcribed from distinct promoters of the CTBP2
gene. The unique N-terminal sequences of RIBEYE and CTBP2 are encoded by
separate 5-prime exons, and the shared C-terminal sequences are encoded
by 8 common 3-prime exons. By Northern blot analysis and immunoblotting,
Schmitz et al. (2000) detected a 120-kD RIBEYE product expressed only in
the retina, whereas the 50-kD CTBP2 product was observed ubiquitously in
most tissues. Using immunocytochemistry, they demonstrated that RIBEYE
is a specific component of synaptic ribbons in the retina and
hypothesized that RIBEYE may be a general component of all synaptic
ribbons. Using transfection experiments, Schmitz et al. (2000)
demonstrated that the N-terminal A domain of RIBEYE can form protein
aggregates. They hypothesized that the A domain may function in the
formation of stable ribbon structures, whereas the B domain may be
exposed on the surface of the ribbons. The B domain shares homology with
2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases and binds to NAD+ with high affinity. They
hypothesized that the B domain may serve as an enzyme in synaptic
vesicle priming on synaptic ribbons and in transcriptional repression.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay and mutation analysis, Turner and Crossley
(1998) found that mouse Ctbp2 interacted with the pro-val-asp-leu-thr
motif in the repression domain of Bklf (KLF3; 609392). When tethered to
a promoter by a heterologous DNA-binding domain, Ctbp2 functioned as a
potent repressor. Ctbp2 also interacted with the mammalian transcription
factors Evi1 (165215), Tcf8, and Fog (ZFPM1; 601950). Turner and
Crossley (1998) concluded that CTBP2 is a mammalian corepressor that
targets diverse transcriptional regulators.

Using 2-hybrid and direct binding assays, Furusawa et al. (1999) showed
that Ctbp2 bound the short medial portion of delta-EF1 containing the
PLDLSL motif. In cotransfection experiments, they observed that Ctbp2
enhanced transrepression activity of delta-EF1. The authors hypothesized
that Ctbp1 and Ctbp2 function as corepressors of delta-EF1 action.

In Drosophila and in vertebrates, the Polycomb (Pc) group (PcG) genes
have been identified as being part of a cellular memory system that is
responsible for the stable and heritable repression of gene expression.
PC2 (603079), a human Pc homolog, CBX2 (602770), HPH1 (602978), HPH2
(602979), BMI1 (164831), and RING1 (602045) form a complex that
localizes in large nuclear domains termed PcG domains. Using a yeast
2-hybrid assay, Sewalt et al. (1999) found that CTBP2 interacts with PC2
and that Xenopus Ctbp1 interacts with Xenopus Pc. The CTBP2 and PC2
interaction also exists in vivo, since the proteins coimmunoprecipitate
with each other and partially colocalize in large PcG domains in
interphase nuclei. CTBP1 showed the same localization pattern. As with
PC2, chimeric LexA-CTBP2 and LexA-CTBP1 proteins repressed gene activity
when targeted to a reporter gene. Sewalt et al. (1999) suggested that
the CTBP proteins target PC2, and thereby the PcG complex, to particular
loci in chromatin that contain binding sites for specific repressors of
gene activity, thereby forming a complex between the repressors and the
PcG complex, with CTBP as a bridging protein. They speculated that the
interference of the adenoviral E1A protein with the transcription
machinery of the infected cell may involve interference with
PcG-mediated repression through disruption of the CTBP-PcG interaction.

Zhang et al. (2002) demonstrated that CTBP binding to cellular and viral
transcriptional repressors is regulated by NAD+ and NADH, with NADH
being 2 to 3 orders of magnitude more effective. Levels of free nuclear
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides, determined using 2-photon
microscopy, corresponded to the levels required for half-maximal CTBP
binding and were considerably lower than those previously reported.
Agents capable of increasing NADH levels stimulated CTBP binding to its
partners in vivo and potentiated CTBP-mediated repression. Zhang et al.
(2002) proposed that this ability to detect changes in nuclear NAD+/NADH
ratio allows CTBP to serve as a redox sensor for transcription.

CTBP is recruited to DNA by transcription factors that contain a PXDLS
motif. Shi et al. (2003) reported the identification of a CTBP complex
that contains the essential components for both gene targeting and
coordinated histone modifications, allowing for the effective repression
of genes targeted by CTBP. This complex has a molecular mass of about
1.3 to 1.5 million and contains CTBP1 and CTBP2 as well as G9A (604599),
EUHMT (607001), COREST (607675), HDAC1 (601241) and HDAC2 (605164),
NPAO, REBB1, ZNF217 (602967), and KIAA0222. Immunoprecipitation with G9A
antibodies brought down the same components as well as HPC2 (ELAC2;
605367). Shi et al. (2003) found that inhibiting the expression of CTBP
and its associated histone-modifying activities by RNA-interference
resulted in alterations of histone modifications at the promoter of the
tumor invasion suppressor gene E-cadherin (192090) and increased
promoter activity in a reporter assay.

Using a promoter pull-down assay followed by mass spectrometry analysis,
Flajollet et al. (2009) identified RREB1 (602209) as a protein that
bound the HLA-G (142871) promoter. RREB1 exerted repressive activity on
the promoter in HLA-G-negative cells that was mediated by recruitment of
HDAC1 and CTBP1 and/or CTBP2. The HLA-G promoter contains 3 RREB1 target
sites. Flajollet et al. (2009) proposed that the repressive activity of
RREB1 on the HLA-G promoter may be regulated by posttranslational
modifications governing its association with CTBP.

MAPPING

Thomas et al. (2008) identified the CTBP2 gene on chromosome 10q26.13,
within a region associated with susceptibility to prostate cancer
(176807).

603184	TITLE *603184 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 8; CDK8
;;K35
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To identify human protein kinases with a role in cell cycle control,
Schultz and Nigg (1993) performed PCR with degenerate oligonucleotides
based on conserved motifs in the catalytic domain of the Aspergillus
nidulans NIMA protein kinase. They isolated 41 distinct promyelocytic
leukemia cell line cDNAs, including 1 partial cDNA designated K35.
Tassan et al. (1995) noted that K35 appears to be structurally related
to cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). By screening a human testis cDNA
library with K35, they isolated cDNAs corresponding to the entire coding
region of CDK8. The predicted 464-amino acid protein contains the
sequence motifs and 11 subdomains characteristic of a
serine/threonine-specific kinase. The protein sequence of CDK8 shares
48% identity over subdomains III to XI with the S. cerevisiae CDK SRB10,
and the 2 proteins have several common features. CDK8 migrated as a
53-kD protein on Western blots of HeLa cell extracts.

GENE FUNCTION

Cyclins are positive regulatory subunits of CDKs. In S. cerevisiae, the
CDK SRB10, a homolog of CDK8, interacts with SRB11, a cyclin related to
mammalian cyclin C (CCNC; 123838). The SRB10-SRB11 complex is part of
the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and acts as a regulator of
transcription. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments by Tassan et al. (1995)
demonstrated that CDK8 interacted with cyclin C both in vitro and in
vivo. Tassan et al. (1995) proposed that CDK8-cyclin C might be
functionally associated with the mammalian transcription apparatus.

Mammalian CDK8 and cyclin C are components of the RNA polymerase II
holoenzyme complex, where they function as a protein kinase that
phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA
polymerase II. The CDK8/cyclin C protein complex is also found in a
number of mammalian Mediator-like protein complexes, which repress
activated transcription independently of the C-terminal domain in vitro.
Akoulitchev et al. (2000) demonstrated that CDK8/cyclin C can regulate
transcription by targeting the CDK7 (601955)/cyclin H (601953) subunits
of the general transcription initiation factor IIH (189972). CDK8
phosphorylates mammalian cyclin H at serine 5 and serine 304 both in
vitro and in vivo, in the vicinity of its functionally unique N- and
C-terminal alpha-helical domains. This phosphorylation represses both
the ability of TFIIH to activate transcription and its C-terminal kinase
activity. In addition, mimicking CDK8 phosphorylation of cyclin H in
vivo has a dominant-negative effect on cell growth. Akoulitchev et al.
(2000) concluded that their results linked the Mediator complex and the
basal transcription machinery by a regulatory pathway involving 2
cyclin-dependent kinases. This pathway appears to be unique to higher
organisms.

p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) is a key mediator of p53 (TP53; 191170)-dependent
cell cycle arrest. Donner et al. (2007) found that transcriptional
activity of the p21 promoter in human cell lines varied in response to
distinct p53-activating stimuli. Core Mediator subunits MED1 (PPARBP;
604311) and MED17 (603810) were recruited to the p21 gene regardless of
the p53-activating stimuli used. In contrast, 3 subunits of the CDK
module of Mediator, CDK8, MED12 (300188), and cyclin C, were recruited
following treatment with nutlin-3, a nongenotoxic drug that activates
p53, but not in response to DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light C.
CDK8 recruitment was also observed during p53-dependent activation of
the HDM2 gene (MDM2; 164785), and the levels of CDK8 occupancy at p53
target genes correlated positively with their transcriptional
activities. RNA interference experiments demonstrated that CDK8
functioned as a positive regulator of p21 and HDM2 transcription.

To identify genes that both modulate beta-catenin (see 116806) activity
and are essential for colon cancer cell proliferation, Firestein et al.
(2008) conducted 2 loss-of-function screens in human colon cancer cells
and compared genes identified in these screens with an analysis of copy
number alterations in colon cancer specimens. One of these genes, CDK8,
which encodes a member of the mediator complex, is located at 13q12.13,
a region of recurrent copy number gain in a substantial fraction of
colon cancers. Firestein et al. (2008) showed that suppression of CDK8
expression inhibits proliferation in colon cancer cells characterized by
high levels of CDK8 and beta-catenin hyperactivity. CDK8 kinase activity
was necessary for beta-catenin-driven transformation and for expression
of several beta-catenin transcriptional targets.

Morris et al. (2008) demonstrated that the transcription factor E2F1
(189971) is a potent and specific inhibitor of beta-catenin/T cell
factor (TCF)-dependent transcription and that this function contributes
to E2F1-induced apoptosis. E2F1 deregulation suppresses beta-catenin
activity in an adenomatous polyposis coli (APC; 611731)/glycogen
synthase kinase-3 (GSK3; see 606784)-independent manner, reducing the
expression of key beta-catenin targets including c-MYC (190080). This
interaction explains why colorectal tumors, which depend on beta-catenin
transcription for their abnormal proliferation, keep RB1 (614041)
intact. Remarkably, E2F1 activity is also repressed by CDK8, a
colorectal oncoprotein. Elevated levels of CDK8 protect
beta-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription from inhibition by E2F1. Morris
et al. (2008) concluded that thus, by retaining RB1 and amplifying CDK8,
colorectal tumor cells select conditions that collectively suppress E2F1
and enhance the activity of beta-catenin.

Kapoor et al. (2010) reported that the histone variant macroH2A (mH2A;
610054) suppresses tumor progression of malignant melanoma. Loss of mH2A
isoforms, histone variants generally associated with condensed chromatin
and fine-tuning of developmental gene expression programs, was
positively correlated with increasing malignant phenotype of melanoma
cells in culture and human tissue samples. Knockdown of mH2A isoforms in
melanoma cells of low malignancy resulted in significantly increased
proliferation and migration in vitro and growth and metastasis in vivo.
Restored expression of mH2A isoforms rescued these malignant phenotypes
in vitro and in vivo. Kapoor et al. (2010) demonstrated that the
tumor-promoting function of mH2A loss is mediated, at least in part,
through direct transcriptional upregulation of CDK8. Suppression of
CDK8, a colorectal cancer oncogene, inhibits proliferation of melanoma
cells, and knockdown of CDK8 in cells depleted of mH2A suppresses the
proliferative advantage induced by mH2A loss. Moreover, a significant
inverse correlation between mH2A and CDK8 expression levels exists in
melanoma patient samples. Kapoor et al. (2010) concluded that mH2A is a
critical component of chromatin that suppresses the development of
malignant melanoma.

MAPPING

Tassan et al. (1995) noted that a DNA fragment corresponding to the CDK8
gene maps to chromosome 13q12.

606625	TITLE *606625 SLAM FAMILY, MEMBER 7; SLAMF7
;;CD2-LIKE RECEPTOR ACTIVATING CYTOTOXIC CELLS; CRACC;;
CS1
DESCRIPTION Natural killer (NK)-cell function is regulated by a balance between
signaling through inhibitory (e.g., KIR2DL1; 604936) and activating
receptors. Some members of the CD2 (186990) family of activating
receptors (e.g., CD244; 605554) stimulate cytotoxicity through the SLAM
(603492)-associated protein (SAP; 300490). Mutations in the SH2 domain
of SAP cause deficiencies in other CD2 family proteins that transduce
signals through SAP, and these deficiencies lead to uncontrolled
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections and, ultimately, to X-linked
lymphoproliferative disease (XLPD; 308240).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences encoding the TxYxxI/V/A
tyrosine motif found in CD244 and SLAM, followed by PCR on an NK-cell
cDNA library and library screening, Boles and Mathew (2001) isolated a
cDNA encoding CS1 (CD2 subset 1). Sequence analysis predicted that the
335-amino acid transmembrane protein has a 225-residue extracellular
domain, which has 7 putative N-linked glycosylation sites, and an
85-amino acid cytoplasmic domain, which contains 2 of the consensus
tyrosine motifs and a third C-terminal tyrosine motif that has phe
instead of thr. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 3.0-kb
CS1 transcript that was highest in spleen, lymph node, and peripheral
blood leukocytes and lowest in bone marrow. Expression was detected in
an NK-cell line but not in promyelocytic, B-, or T-cell lines.

Bouchon et al. (2001) also cloned CS1, which they termed CRACC. They
noted the presence of 2 CD2-like Ig folds in the extracellular domain of
CRACC. RT-PCR analysis detected CRACC expression in NK and CD8 (see
186910)-positive cytotoxic cells. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated
expression of CRACC on nearly all NK cells, a large subset of CD8 cells,
and few CD4 (186940) cells and B cells. Expression on B cells was
upregulated upon CD40 (109535) activation, and expression on dendritic
cells was upregulated by influenza virus, lipopolysaccharide, and CD40L
(300386). Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE analyses showed expression of
a 66-kD protein and, after deglycosylation, a 37-kD protein. Functional
analysis indicated that CRACC mediates lysis that is in addition to that
mediated by NKP46 (604530) or CD16 (146740). Further analysis determined
that, unlike CD244, cytotoxicity mediated by CRACC or NKP46 is
SAP-independent and that CRACC triggers ERK (see 601335) activation.
Immunoblot analysis showed that CRACC is tyrosine phosphorylated in
activated NK cells and is associated with 19- and 39-kD proteins.
Bouchon et al. (2001) proposed that CRACC may be particularly important
in controlling pathogens other than EBV.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Boles and Mathew (2001) determined that
the CS1 gene spans 13 kb, with a relatively small (8.7 kb) intron 1
compared with the 17-kb intron 1 of the CD244 gene.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Boles and Mathew (2001) and Bouchon et al.
(2001) mapped the CS1 gene to chromosome 1q23-q24, between the CD48
(109530) and CD229 (LY9; 600684) genes.

PEROXIDE REDUCTASE, THIOREDOXIN-DEPENDENT; TDPX1; TPX1;;
NATURAL KILLER-ENHANCING FACTOR B; NKEFB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Shau et al. (1994) identified a red blood cell factor, NKEF, that
enhances natural killer (NK) cell activity. By immunoscreening an
erythroleukemia cDNA library, they isolated cDNAs encoding NKEFA (PRDX1;
176763) and NKEFB. The NKEFA and NKEFB proteins contain 199 and 198
amino acids, respectively, and are 75% identical. The authors noted that
proteins related to NKEFA and NKEFB appear to be induced by oxidative
stress. Shau et al. (1994) concluded that in addition to
immunoregulation of NK activity, the NKEFs may be important for cells in
coping with oxidative insults.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals that are produced during
normal metabolism have the potential of damaging cellular
macromolecules. Defenses against such damage include a number of
antioxidant enzymes that specifically target the removal or dismutation
of the reactive agent. Pahl et al. (1995) isolated a human gene,
symbolized TDPX1 (for thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase-1), that
encodes an enzyme homologous to the yeast thioredoxin peroxidase (TPX).
The human coding sequence was determined from the product of a PCR
amplification of human cDNA using primers based on the rat sequence
(Chae et al., 1994). The 198-amino acid rat protein was, in turn,
isolated as a cDNA from a brain expression library with antibodies to
bovine thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA) enzyme. The rat and yeast TSA
proteins show significant similarity to Salmonella typhimurium alkyl
hydroperoxide reductase.

MAPPING

Based on PCR analysis of DNAs from a human/rodent somatic cell hybrid
panel, Pahl et al. (1995) assigned the TDPX1 locus to chromosome 13.
Further localization to 13q12 was achieved by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, using as a probe DNA from a YAC that contained the TDPX1
gene. However, Gross (2012) mapped the PRDX2 gene to chromosome 19p13.2
based on an alignment of the PRDX2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC003022)
with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

To clarify the physiologic relevance of peroxiredoxins, Lee et al.
(2003) generated a mouse model deficient in PRDX2, which is abundantly
expressed in all types of cells. The Prdx2 -/- mice were healthy in
appearance and fertile. However, they had splenomegaly caused by the
congestion of red pulp with hemosiderin accumulation. Heinz bodies were
detected in their peripheral blood, and morphologically abnormal cells
were increased in the dense red blood cell (RBC) fractions, which
contained markedly higher levels of ROS. The null mice had significantly
decreased hematocrit levels, but increased reticulocyte counts and
erythropoietin levels, indicative of a compensatory action to maintain
hematologic homeostasis. A labeling experiment in null mice showed that
a variety of RBC proteins were highly oxidized. The results suggested
that Prdx -/- mice have hemolytic anemia and that peroxiredoxin II plays
a major role in protecting RBCs from oxidative stress in mice.

Choi et al. (2005) demonstrated that PRDX2 is a negative regulator of
PDGF (see 190040) signaling. Prx II deficiency results in increased
production of peroxide, enhanced activation of PDGF receptor (PDGFR; see
173490) and phospholipase C-gamma-1 (172420), and subsequently increased
cell proliferation and migration in response to PDGF. These responses
are suppressed by expression of wildtype Prx II, but not an inactive
mutant. Notably, Prx II is recruited to PDGFR upon PDGF stimulation, and
suppresses protein tyrosine phosphatase inactivation. Prx II also leads
to the suppression of PDGFR activation in primary culture and in a
murine restenosis model, including PDGF-dependent neointimal thickening
of vascular smooth muscle cells. Choi et al. (2005) concluded that their
results demonstrate a localized role for endogenous peroxide in PDGF
signaling, and indicate a biologic function for Prx II in cardiovascular
disease.

By immunoblot, liquid chromatographic mass spectrometric,
immunoelectron, and confocal microscopic analyses, Koncarevic et al.
(2009) showed that human PRX2 was enriched in the malaria parasite,
Plasmodium falciparum. Importation of PRX2 into the parasite cytosol
compensated for the lack of catalase and glutathione peroxidase and
helped to maintain an adequate antioxidant defense. Pull-down
experiments demonstrated that PRX2 interacted with and was active with
parasite Trx1. PRX2 accounted for about half of the thioredoxin activity
in parasite extracts, and PRX2 expression was increased in the presence
of chloroquine, regardless of P. falciparum strain susceptibility to the
drug. Koncarevic et al. (2009) concluded that P. falciparum has adapted
to adopt PRX2, using the host protein for its own purposes.

O'Neill and Reddy (2011) studied circadian clocks in human red blood
cells in order to avoid the transcription-translation feedloop that is
presumed to be essential for clock formation. Human red blood cells have
no nucleus and therefore cannot perform transcription. O'Neill and Reddy
(2011) found that transcription is not required for circadian
oscillations in humans, and that nontranscriptional events seem to be
sufficient to sustain cellular circadian rhythms. Using red blood cells,
they found that peroxiredoxins, highly conserved antioxidant proteins,
undergo approximately 24-hour redox cycles, which persist for many days
under constant conditions (i.e., in the absence of external cues).
Moreover, these rhythms are entrainable (i.e., tunable by environmental
stimuli) and temperature-compensated, both key features of circadian
rhythms. O'Neill and Reddy (2011) anticipated that their findings would
facilitate more sophisticated cellular clock models, highlighting the
interdependency of transcriptional and nontranscriptional oscillations
in potentially all eukaryotic cells.

O'Neill et al. (2011) showed that nontranscriptional mechanisms are
sufficient to sustain circadian timekeeping in the eukaryotic lineage,
although they normally function in conjunction with transcriptional
components. They identified oxidation of peroxiredoxin proteins as a
transcription-independent rhythmic biomarker, which is also rhythmic in
mammals. Moreover, O'Neill et al. (2011) showed that pharmacologic
modulators of the mammalian clock mechanism have the same effects on
rhythms in Ostreococcus tauri, a unicellular pico-eukaryotic alga that
possesses a naturally minimized clock. Posttranslational mechanisms, and
at least 1 rhythmic marker, seem to be better conserved than
transcriptional clock regulators. O'Neill et al. (2011) postulated that
it is plausible that the oldest oscillator components are
nontranscriptional in nature, as in cyanobacteria, and are conserved
across kingdoms.

606886	TITLE *606886 RNA-BINDING MOTIF PROTEIN 6; RBM6
;;DEF3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Gure et al. (1998) identified RBM6, which they called NY-LU-12, by
immunoscreening a recombinant lung cancer cDNA expression library with
autologous patient serum. They cloned the full-length cDNA from normal
testis mRNA through a combination of 5-prime RACE and direct PCR. In
addition to the dominant transcript, they identified 3 minor forms that
contain additional exon(s). The deduced 1,123-amino acid major protein
contains 20 inexact 6-amino acid repeats close to the N terminus; 2
RNA-binding domains; 2 zinc finger motifs; a bipartite nuclear
localization signal; and a 4-residue nuclear localization pattern. They
noted that all of the predicted functional domains in RBM6 are also
present in RBM5 (606884), with which it shares 30% identity. Northern
blot analysis detected several RBM6 transcripts, ranging from
approximately 3 to 4.4 kb, in all tissues examined. Highest expression
was in liver, with intermediate expression in placenta, lung, skeletal
muscle, and kidney. Southern blot analysis showed no evidence of
homozygous deletion of RBM6 in tumor cell lines, the gene being
partially deleted in only 1 of 9 lung cancer cell lines.

Drabkin et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding RBM6, which they called
DEF3, by positional cloning from a small cell lung carcinoma homozygous
deletion region on chromosome 3p21.3. The human and mouse RBM6 proteins
share 89% amino acid identity. Northern blot analysis indicated highest
expression in heart, intermediate levels in brain, placenta, liver,
skeletal muscle, and pancreas, and low expression in lung and kidney. In
hematopoietic tissues, highest expression was in lymph node and thymus,
with lower expression in bone marrow. Two bands were observed in
peripheral blood leukocytes and fetal liver. Northern blot analysis
showed constitutive expression of mouse Rbm6 during embryogenesis, as
well as expression in all adult mouse tissues examined.

Timmer et al. (1999) identified a YAC clone corresponding to chromosome
3p21.3 that is deleted in the small cell lung cancer cell line GLC20.
They isolated and cloned RBM6 by direct hybridization of this YAC clone
to a lung cDNA library. Northern blot analysis identified RBM6
transcripts of 4.7, 3.9, and 2.1 kb in all tissues tested. Although RBM6
maps to the critical region homozygously deleted in a small cell lung
carcinoma cell line, the authors found that the 5-prime end crosses the
telomeric breakpoint of the deletion. Northern and Southern analyses of
a number of lung cancer cell lines revealed no patterns of aberrant RBM6
expression.

GENE FUNCTION

Drabkin et al. (1999) found that recombinant proteins containing the RNA
recognition motifs of RBM5 or RBM6 specifically bind poly(G) RNA
homopolymers in vitro.

GENE STRUCTURE

Timmer et al. (1999) determined that the RBM6 gene contains 20 exons.

MAPPING

Timmer et al. (1999) identified the RBM5 gene within a YAC clone
corresponding to chromosome 3p21.3. By FISH, Heng et al. (2000) mapped
the mouse gene to chromosome 9F1-F2.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By large-scale sequence analysis of chromosome 21q, Slavov et al. (2000)
identified DONSON, which they called B17. RT-PCR showed B17 expression
in HeLa cells, 8-week fetus, 10-week fetus, fetal brain, adult brain,
cerebellum, hippocampus, occipital lobe, and vermis.

GENE STRUCTURE

By sequence analysis, Slavov et al. (2000) predicted that the DONSON
gene contains at least 7 exons spanning 10 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Slavov et al. (2000) mapped the DONSON
gene to chromosome 21q22.1.

Wynn et al. (2000) determined that both human and mouse SON (182465) and
DONSON are in tail-to-tail orientation and in the following order: GART
(138440)-SON-DONSON.

KOX32 is a 1.4-kb cDNA fragment of the ZNF34 zinc finger gene cloned
into the EcoRI site of a plasmid vector. La Pillo et al. (1993)
described a BanII RFLP in the ZNF34 gene.

MAPPING

Huebner et al. (1991) mapped the ZNF34 gene to chromosome 8q24, proximal
to MYC (190080) by somatic cell hybrid analysis and in situ chromosomal
hybridization. Since MYC is located in 8q24.12-q24.13 and both genes
were found to be intact in 2 patients with Langer-Giedion syndrome
(150230) and a deletion of 8q22.3-q24.11 and 8q23.3-q24.12,
respectively, La Pillo et al. (1993) concluded that ZNF34 is located in
8q24.12-q24.13.

607494	TITLE *607494 INOSITOL POLYPHOSPHATE-4-PHOSPHATASE, TYPE II, 105-KD; INPP4B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

INPP4B is a Mg(2+)-independent phosphatase that catalyzes the hydrolysis
of the 4-position phosphate of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate,
inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, and inositol 3,4-bisphosphate.

CLONING

Norris et al. (1997) identified ESTs for INPP4B by homology with the rat
sequence and isolated clones from a human brain cDNA library. The
deduced 934-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about
105 kD. It contains an active site consensus sequence identified in
several other Mg(2+)-independent phosphatases. Unlike INPP4A (600916),
INPP4B does not have a PEST sequence. The human and rat proteins share
90% sequence identity. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous
expression, with primary transcripts of 9.5, 5.3, 3.9, and 2.9 kb.
Highest expression was detected in skeletal muscle and heart, with
intermediate levels in brain, placenta, and pancreas, and lowest levels
in liver, kidney, and lung. The 5.3-kb transcript was detected only in
brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Recombinant rat Inpp4b showed enzymatic properties similar to those
reported for human INPP4A. Inpp4b catalyzed the hydrolysis of
phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol
3-phosphate in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. It also
showed optimal activity between pH 7 and pH 8 and was inhibited by
inositol hexakisphosphate.

;;FK506-BINDING PROTEIN, 19-KD; FKBP19
DESCRIPTION For background information on FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), see FKBP1A
(186945).

CLONING

By searching databases for putative FKBPs, Rulten et al. (2006) obtained
a full-length cDNA encoding FKBP11, which they called FKBP19. The
deduced 201-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 22 kD.
It has an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by a peptidyl-prolyl
isomerase domain, a transmembrane region, and a lysine-rich C-terminal
tail containing a variant of the dilysine motif found in endoplasmic
reticulum membrane proteins. Northern blot analysis detected high
expression of an 800-bp transcript in pancreas, with low levels in all
other tissues examined. RNA dot blot analysis revealed ubiquitous FKBP11
expression, with highest levels in pancreas and other secretory tissues,
such as stomach, pituitary, salivary gland, and lymph node.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an in vitro binding assay, Rulten et al. (2006) showed that FKBP11
bound FK506 weakly.

GENE STRUCTURE

Patterson et al. (2002) determined that the FKBP11 gene has 6 coding
exons. Rulten et al. (2006) identified 5 NKX2-5 (NKX2E; 600584)-binding
sites and 4 PAX4 (167413)-binding sites upstream of the FKBP11 coding
region.

MAPPING

Rulten et al. (2006) stated that the FKBP11 gene maps to chromosome
12q13.

;;GAGE7B
DESCRIPTION See GAGE1 (300594) for more information about the GAGE gene cluster.

CLONING

By screening a melanoma cell cDNA library with GAGE1 (300594) as probe,
De Backer et al. (1999) cloned GAGE12I, which they called GAGE7B. GAGE7B
differs from GAGE7 (300601) cloned by Chen et al. (1998) by only a
single nucleotide and encodes the same putative 117-amino acid protein.

GENE FUNCTION

De Backer et al. (1999) showed that expression of GAGE7B was induced
after treatment of peripheral blood leukocytes with phytohemagglutinin.

GENE STRUCTURE

De Backer et al. (1999) determined that the GAGE7B gene contains 5
exons. The first exon is noncoding, and intron 4 contains a LINE
insertion, which disrupts a putative exon comparable to exon 4-prime in
the GAGE1 gene.

Gjerstorff and Ditzel (2008) stated that the GAGE12I gene is contained
within a 9.5-kb GAGE repeat and the 5 exons of GAGE12I span about 6.3
kb.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, De Backer et al. (1999) mapped
the GAGE7B gene to chromosome Xp11.4-p11.2.

By genomic sequence analysis, Gjerstorff and Ditzel (2008) mapped the
GAGE12I gene to a GAGE gene cluster in chromosome Xp11.23.

;;SMALL EDRK-RICH FACTOR 1; SERF1;;
SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY-RELATED GENE H4F5; H4F5;;
SMA MODIFIER 1; SMAM1
DESCRIPTION Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has been classified into 3 types based on
age of onset and severity. SMA I-III all map to 5q13, and nearly all
patients display deletions or gene conversions of the SMN1 gene
(600354). Although some correlation has been established between SMN
protein levels and disease course, the genetic basis for SMA phenotypic
variability is mainly unexplained, and it had been postulated that the
loss of an additional modifying factor contributes to the severity of
type I SMA. Scharf et al. (1998) found that a multicopy microsatellite
marker deleted in more than 90% of type I SMA chromosomes was embedded
in an intron of H4F5, indicating that this gene is also highly deleted
in type I SMA chromosomes, and thus is a candidate phenotypic modifier
for SMA. The microsatellite marker, designated C212, is located in the
last intron of H4F5, 5 kb upstream of H4F5 exon 3b and 13 kb upstream of
SMN exon 1. In 58 type I SMA patients of varied European and Arabian
descent, Scharf et al. (1998) found a reduction or absence of C212/H4F5
alleles in 94% of chromosomes, implying a deletion of 1 or both copies
of the marker and therefore of H4F5 exon 3b in these individuals. In
comparison with the high rate of C212/H4F5 deletions in type I SMA, the
C212 deletion frequency in type II SMA chromosomes was between that of
type I and control chromosomes, whereas deletions in type III
chromosomes were only slightly more frequent than in controls.

Scharf et al. (1998) sequenced a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
containing the mouse Smn gene to identify conserved elements between the
human SMA interval and its previously identified syntenic region on
mouse chromosome 13 (Scharf et al., 1996). The resulting sequence was
filtered for repetitive elements and used to screen the EST database.
ESTs corresponding to SMN and NAIP were identified as well as 2 ESTs
representing novel genes within the BAC. One of these ESTs, clone
368449, mapped to 10.6 kb upstream of mouse Smn; subsequent analysis of
surrounding genomic sequences using 4 exon-prediction programs
identified no additional transcripts between 368449 and Smn or between
Smn and Naip. The full-length 566-bp mouse 368449 cDNA and its human
ortholog were cloned from a mouse brain and human skeletal muscle cDNA
library, respectively. The human clone was 99% homologous to exon 4F5,
an exon previously trapped from an SMA cosmid known to contain SMN exon
1. The full-length human cDNA was named H4F5, and its mouse counterpart
M4f5, until an appropriate function can be assigned to the 2 genes. The
proteins displayed 97% amino acid similarity to one another and both
genes were ubiquitously expressed with highest RNA levels in testis. In
addition, H4F5 has a larger 1.8-kb isoform, H4F5L, with a predicted
110-amino acid open reading frame that results from alternative splicing
of exon 3. In contrast to the 0.6-kb mouse and 0.7-kb human 4F5S
isoforms, the 1.8-kb H4F5L transcript is predominantly expressed in
heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. Both isoforms are also expressed
throughout the central nervous system, including spinal cord, which is
the tissue primarily affected in SMA. H4F5 was found to lie closer to
SMN1 than any previously identified gene in the region.

609671	TITLE *609671 SIX-TRANSMEMBRANE EPITHELIAL ANTIGEN OF PROSTATE 3; STEAP3
;;TUMOR SUPPRESSOR-ACTIVATED PATHWAY 6; TSAP6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Passer et al. (2003) cloned human STEAP3, which they called TSAP6, from
a pooled-tissue cDNA library. The deduced 488-amino acid protein
contains an N-terminal motif associated with oxidoreductases and
dehydrogenases and 5 or 6 transmembrane domains. Human TSAP6 shares 87%
amino acid identity with mouse Tsap6. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected a 4.3-kb transcript expressed highly in liver and at a
lower level in skeletal muscle. Heart, brain, placenta, lung, kidney,
and pancreas expressed little to no TSAP6. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected expression predominantly in heart, spleen, lung,
liver, and skeletal muscle. Western blot analysis of mouse and human
cell lines detected TSAP6 at an apparent molecular mass of 50 to 55 kD.

Using Western blot analysis, Lespagnol et al. (2008) detected Tsap6
proteins of 46 and 52 kD in mouse NIH3T3 cells, and they showed that the
larger protein resulted from glycosylation. Confocal microscopy of mouse
embryonic fibroblasts showed colocalization of endogenous Tsap6 with the
trans-Golgi network maker Tgn38 (TGOLN; 603062). Punctuated cytoplasmic
and plasma membrane staining of Tsap6 partially colocalized with
transferrin receptor (TFRC; 190010) and Eea1 (605070), suggesting that
Tsap6 is expressed in the endosomal compartment.

MAPPING

By FISH, Passer et al. (2003) mapped the STEAP3 gene to chromosome
2q14.2. They mapped the mouse Steap3 gene to chromosome 1.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Northern blot analysis, Passer et al. (2003) found that p53 (TP53;
191170) upregulated TSAP6 expression in mouse and human cell lines. They
identified a p53-responsive element upstream of the first exon of the
mouse Tsap6 gene. TSAP6 antisense cDNA decreased the level of
p53-induced apoptosis, and TSAP6 small interfering RNA inhibited
apoptosis in TSAP6-overexpressing cells. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis,
protein pull-down assays, and coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed
that TSAP6 interacted with NIX (BNIP3; 605368), a proapoptotic BCL2
(151430)-related protein, and with MYT1 kinase (602474), a negative
regulator of G2/M transition. Moreover, TSAP6 enhanced the
susceptibility of cells to apoptosis and cooperated with NIX to
exacerbate this effect. Cell cycle studies indicated that TSAP6 could
augment MYT1 activity. Passer et al. (2003) concluded that TSAP6 may act
downstream of p53 to interface apoptosis and cell cycle progression.

Histamine-releasing factor (TPT1; 600763) is a secreted protein that
participates in inflammatory responses by promoting the release of
histamine. Amzallag et al. (2004) found that secretion of TPT1 proceeded
by a nonclassical pathway independent of the endoplasmic reticulum and
Golgi apparatus. They determined that TSAP6 interacted with TPT1 in
several protein interaction assays, and the 2 proteins codistributed to
small vesicles called exosomes at the plasma membrane and around the
nucleus in several human cell lines. Overexpression of TSAP6 increased
the level of TPT1 in exosome preparations and consistently enhanced TPT1
secretion. Amzallag et al. (2004) concluded that TSAP6 has a role in the
export of TPT1 via a nonclassical pathway and suggested that TSAP6 may
have a general role in the regulation of vesicular trafficking and
secretion.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 sibs with hypochromic microcytic anemia and iron overload (615234),
born of nonconsanguineous Pakistani parents, Grandchamp et al. (2011)
analyzed 7 candidate genes and identified heterozygosity for a nonsense
mutation in the STEAP3 gene (C100X; 609671.0001) that was inherited from
their unaffected father. Quantitative analysis of mRNA levels suggested
that the father was heterozygous with 1 null allele and 1 normal, highly
expressed allele, whereas their unaffected mother had 2 weakly expressed
alleles, and each affected offspring had inherited the mutated allele
from their father and 1 of the weakly expressed alleles from their
mother. Using two 3-prime common polymorphisms in high linkage
disequilibrium as markers to perform quantitative sequencing of cDNA
from the blood of 20 control individuals, Grandchamp et al. (2011)
demonstrated a 2.5-fold variation in the C/T and A/C ratios among 17
individuals informative for dbSNP rs6753006 and 12 individuals
informative for dbSNP rs3731603, respectively, thus confirming
variability of STEAP3 expression in the general population.

ANIMAL MODEL

The reduction of iron is an essential step in the transferrin (TF;
190000) cycle, which is the dominant pathway for iron uptake by red
blood cell precursors. A deficiency in iron acquisition by red blood
cells leads to hypochromic, microcytic anemia. Using a positional
cloning strategy, Ohgami et al. (2005) identified the Steap3 gene as
responsible for the iron deficiency anemia in the mouse mutant nm1054.
They showed that Steap3 is expressed highly in hematopoietic tissues,
colocalizes with the transferrin cycle endosome, and facilitates
transferrin-bound iron uptake. Overexpression of Steap3 stimulated the
reduction of iron, and mice lacking Steap3 were deficient in erythroid
ferrireductase activity. These findings taken together were interpreted
as indicating that Steap3 is an endosomal ferrireductase required for
efficient transferrin-dependent iron uptake in erythroid cells.

Lespagnol et al. (2008) generated Tsap6 -/- mice and found that Tsap6
-/- splenocytes accumulated Tctp (TPT1) and Tfrc. Spleens of Tsap6 -/-
mice were enlarged with altered splenic architecture on histopathologic
analysis, and reticulocytes and erythrocytes were small and abnormally
shaped, consistent with microcytic anemia. Analysis of reticulocyte
maturation revealed a delay in Tfrc expulsion and reduced secretion of
exosomes. Induction of p53-mediated apoptosis, but not of p53- dependent
p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) expression, was attenuated in Tsap6 -/- spleen.
Following activation of p53 by DNA damage, Tsap6 -/- cells exhibited a
significant reduction in exosome secretion and an absence of exosomal
protein upregulation compared with wildtype controls. Lespagnol et al.
(2008) concluded that increased p53-mediated secretion of exosomes
following DNA damage is dependent on TSAP6 and that TSAP6 is needed to
expel proteins no longer required by cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ANEMIA, HYPOCHROMIC MICROCYTIC, WITH IRON OVERLOAD 2 (1 family)
STEAP3, CYS100TER

In 3 sibs with hypochromic microcytic anemia and iron overload (615234),
born of nonconsanguineous Pakistani parents, Grandchamp et al. (2011)
identified heterozygosity for a c.300C-A transition in exon 3 of the
STEAP3 gene, resulting in a cys100-to-ter (C100X) substitution. The
mutation was inherited from their unaffected father and was not found in
their unaffected mother or 200 control chromosomes. Quantitative RT-PCR
from blood mRNA of all 5 family members and 10 controls showed that the
STEAP3 mRNA level was considerably lower in the 3 patients, whereas both
parents had a level of STEAP3 mRNA corresponding to the low-normal range
found in controls. In B lymphocyte-cell lines treated to prevent
degradation due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, quantitative sequencing
of a cDNA fragment encompassing the mutated nucleotide demonstrated that
expression of the normal allele relative to that of the mutated allele
was significantly higher in the father than in the 3 sibs. Grandchamp et
al. (2011) suggested that the father was heterozygous with 1 null allele
and 1 normal, highly expressed allele, whereas the mother had 2 weakly
expressed alleles, and each affected offspring had inherited the mutated
allele from their father and 1 of the weakly expressed alleles from
their mother. This was supported by the fact that expression of both
alleles from the mother produced an amount of mRNA that was roughly
equivalent to the expression products from the single normal allele of
the father.

164875	TITLE *164875 VAV1 ONCOGENE; VAV1
;;ONCOGENE VAV;;
ONCOGENE VAV1
DESCRIPTION The VAV oncogene was generated by genomic rearrangement that replaced
the 5-prime domain of the VAV protooncogene by sequences from a
bacterial gene present in the cotransfecting DNA used as a selectable
marker during gene transfer assay (Katzav et al., 1989). A high level of
expression of the VAV oncogene leads to morphologic transformation of
NIH 3T3 cells in culture and to the efficient induction of tumors in
immunocompromised mice. The VAV gene directs the synthesis of a 3.0-kb
transcript that is specifically expressed in cells of hematopoietic
origin, including those of erythroid, lymphoid, and myeloid lineages.
The predicted amino acid sequence of the gene product exhibits motifs
characteristic of transcriptional factors, including a highly acidic
amino-terminal region, separated from 2 putative nuclear localization
signals by a proline-rich sequence, and 2 zinc finger-like domains.

Bustelo and Barbacid (1992) presented results suggesting that the VAV
protooncogene participates in the signaling processes that mediate the
antigen-induced activation of B lymphocytes.

Fackler et al. (1999) identified the protooncogene and guanine
nucleotide exchange factor VAV as the specific binding partner of Nef
proteins from HIV-1. The interaction between Nef and VAV led to
increased activity of VAV and its downstream effectors. Both
cytoskeletal changes and the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (see
602896) were observed. Fackler et al. (1999) concluded that the
interaction between Nef and VAV initiates a signaling cascade that
changes structural and physiologic parameters in the infected cell.

By analysis of a rodent-human hybrid DNA panel and by chromosomal in
situ hybridization, Martinerie et al. (1990) assigned the VAV locus to
19p13.2-p12. VAV and INSR, the insulin receptor gene (147670), appeared
to be closely linked; INSR and VAV migrated together in high molecular
weight DNA fragments created with rare cutting restriction enzymes that
were subjected to pulsed field gel electrophoresis. It may be worth
noting that transcription factor-3 (147141), which has been implicated
in acute lymphoblastic leukemia associated with translocations (p1;19),
is located at 19p13.3-p13.2. By fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Trask et al. (1993) assigned the VAV gene to 19p13.3-p13.2.

Studies by Tarakhovsky et al. (1995), Zhang et al. (1995), and Fischer
et al. (1995) demonstrated functional consequences of VAV gene deletion.
The investigators used homologous recombination to introduce a null
mutation into embryonic stem (ES) cells. Tarakhovsky et al. (1995)
reported that in the absence of VAV antigen, receptor mediated
proliferative responses of B and T cells are severely reduced. Fischer
et al. (1995) demonstrated that VAV-dependent signaling pathways
regulate the maturation of T cells. The studies reported by Zhang et al.
(1995) confirmed that VAV plays a role in T- and B-cell development and
activation.

Using genomic sequence analysis, Denkinger et al. (2000) determined that
the VAV1 gene contains 27 exons and spans 77 kb on chromosome 19. Its
overall exon organization is similar to that of VAV2 (600428). They also
identified several differences from the original VAV cDNA sequence,
notably, that there is an isoleucine at position 718 rather than a
threonine, which changes the classification of the VAV SH2 domain from
type 3 to type 2. Promoter analysis indicated that a 23-bp segment that
includes a potential CBF/AML1 (see 151385)-binding site is essential for
VAV expression in a monocytoid cell line.

Moores et al. (2000) expressed VAV1, VAV2, and VAV3 (605541) at
equivalent levels and found that each responds to similar surface
receptor tyrosine kinases. Integrin-induced phosphorylation required the
presence of SYK (600085). Only VAV1 could efficiently cooperate with
T-cell receptor (TCR; see 186880) signaling to enhance NFAT
(600489)-dependent transcription, while only VAV1 and VAV3 could enhance
nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011)-dependent transcription.

Bustelo (2000) presented a comprehensive review of the regulatory and
signaling properties of the VAV family.

603437	TITLE *603437 COLD-SHOCK DOMAIN PROTEIN A; CSDA
;;DNA-BINDING PROTEIN A; DBPA
DESCRIPTION Cold-shock domain (CSD) proteins are characterized by a highly conserved
central domain of approximately 100 amino acids that is homologous to
bacterial cold-shock proteins.

To identify cDNAs encoding DNA-binding proteins (DBPs), Sakura et al.
(1988) screened a human placenta cDNA expression library with DNA
fragments containing either the human epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR; 131550) enhancer or the human c-erbB2 (164870) promoter. They
isolated cDNAs encoding DBPA and DBPB (154030). The DBPA cDNAs consisted
of 2 forms that differ by an internal 207-bp deletion. Northern blot
analysis of HeLa cell RNA detected a major 2.5-kb DBPA transcript and a
minor 2.3-kb DBPA transcript. The deduced DBPA and DBPB proteins share a
central region in which 100 of 109 amino acids are identical between the
2 proteins.

Kudo et al. (1995) isolated full-length human cDNAs encoding DBPA and
DBPB by screening for proteins that bind to the human leukosialin
(182160) promoter. The deduced 342-amino acid DBPA protein has a
cold-shock domain and a DNA-binding domain. The authors isolated the
DBPA genomic sequence and found that it contains 10 exons spanning 24
kb; exon 6, which encodes 69 amino acids, is alternatively spliced.
Northern blot analysis of human tissues demonstrated highest levels of
DBPA transcription in skeletal muscle and heart. Immunofluorescence
detected DBPA protein expression in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of
HeLa cells.

Independently, Coles et al. (1996) isolated DBPA and DBPB cDNAs by
screening for proteins that are able to bind to the repressor element in
the human GMCSF (138960) promoter. They determined that their DBPA cDNA
has a variant sequence compared to the previously reported DBPA cDNA
sequences, resulting in a deduced 372-amino acid protein with 4 amino
acid substitutions and a 30-amino acid C-terminal extension.
Overexpression of this variant DBPA led to repression of the GMCSF
promoter.

Kudo et al. (1995) mapped the CSDA gene to 12p13.1 by in situ
hybridization.

RECOMBINATION PROTEIN A; RECA;;

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RAD51 has a critical role in the maintenance of genomic integrity by
functioning in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. RAD51 mediates
homologous pairing and strand exchange in recombinatory structures known
as RAD51 foci in the nucleus (summary by Park et al., 2008).

CLONING

In Escherichia coli, the RecA protein searches for homologous regions
between 2 double-stranded DNA molecules and promotes strand exchange. It
is also involved in recombinational repair of double-strand breaks
(DSBs). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the protein encoded by rad51 is
required for repair of DSBs that occur in mitosis or meiosis. By
searching for orthologs of E. coli RecA, Shinohara et al. (1993) cloned
genes from human, mouse, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast)
that are homologous to rad51. Human and mouse RAD51 are identical
339-amino acid proteins and are highly homologous (83%) with the yeast
rad51 proteins. The mouse gene was transcribed at a high level in
thymus, spleen, testis, and ovary and at a lower level in brain.

By screening a testis cDNA library with a RAD51 probe, Park et al.
(2008) cloned a RAD51 splice variant lacking exon 9, which they called
RAD51-delta-ex9. The deduced 280-amino acid protein is identical to
full-length RAD51 for the first 259 amino acids, which includes an
N-terminal basic motif followed by the Walker A and B ATP-binding
motifs. The 2 proteins diverge at their C termini, but both C termini
contain basic motifs predicted to function as nuclear localization
signals. PCR analysis detected high expression of full-length RAD51 in
testis, with moderate expression detected in placenta, thymus, pancreas,
and colon, and weaker expression detected in lung, liver, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and ovary. RAD51-delta-ex9 was highly expressed in
testis, with much weaker expression only in skeletal muscle, pancreas,
thymus, and ovary. Western blot analysis of human testis detected RAD51
and RAD51-delta-ex9 at apparent molecular masses of 37 and 31 kD,
respectively. RAD51, but not RAD51-delta-ex9, was also detected at a
lower level in placenta, lung, and small intestine. Fluorescence-tagged
RAD51 and RAD51-delta-ex9 proteins both localized to the nucleus of
transfected COS-7 cells, with exclusion from nucleoli.

Using Western blot analysis, Sage et al. (2010) showed that a part of
the cytoplasmic pool of RAD51 in human cell lines fractionated with
mitochondria.

GENE FUNCTION

Solinger et al. (2002) showed that RAD54 (603615) protein dissociates
RAD51 from nucleoprotein filaments formed on double-stranded DNA
(dsDNA). Addition of RAD54 protein overcame inhibition of DNA strand
exchange by RAD51 protein bound to substrate dsDNA. Species preference
in the RAD51 dissociation and DNA strand exchange assays underlined the
importance of specific RAD54-RAD51 protein interactions. RAD51 protein
was unable to release dsDNA upon ATP hydrolysis, leaving it stuck on the
heteroduplex DNA product after DNA strand exchange. The authors
suggested that RAD54 protein is involved in the turnover of RAD51-dsDNA
filaments.

In S. cerevisiae, the Srs2 helicase negatively modulates recombination,
and later experiments have suggested that it reverses intermediate
recombination structures. Veaute et al. (2003) demonstrated that DNA
strand exchange mediated in vitro by RAD51 is inhibited by Srs2, and
that Srs2 disrupts RAD51 filaments formed on single-stranded DNA. Veaute
et al. (2003) concluded that their data provided an explanation for the
antirecombinogenic role of Srs2 in vivo and highlighted a theretofore
unknown mechanism for recombination control.

Krejci et al. (2003) clarified the role of Srs2 in recombination
modulation by purifying its encoded product and examining its
interactions with the RAD51 recombinase. Srs2 has a robust ATPase
activity that is dependent on single-stranded DNA and binds RAD51, but
the addition of a catalytic quantity of Srs2 to RAD51-mediated
recombination reactions causes severe inhibition of these reactions.
Krejci et al. (2003) showed that Srs2 acts by dislodging RAD51 from
single-stranded DNA. Thus, the attenuation of recombination efficiency
by Srs2 stems primarily from its ability to dismantle the RAD51
presynaptic filament efficiently. Krejci et al. (2003) suggested that
their findings have implications for the basis of Bloom (210900) and
Werner (277700) syndromes, which are caused by mutations in DNA
helicases and are characterized by increased frequencies of
recombination and a predisposition to cancers and accelerated aging.

Hussain et al. (2003) found that the FANCG protein (602956) colocalized
in nuclear foci with both BRCA2 (600185) and RAD51 following DNA damage
with mitomycin C. The authors concluded that BRCA2 is directly connected
to a pathway deficient in interstrand crosslink repair, and that at
least 1 other Fanconi anemia protein is closely associated with the
homologous recombination DNA repair machinery.

Dong et al. (2003) isolated a holoenzyme complex containing BRCA1
(113705), BRCA2, BARD1 (610593), and RAD51, which they called the BRCA1-
and BRCA2-containing complex (BRCC). The complex showed UBC5 (see
UBE2D1; 602961)-dependent ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. Inclusion of BRE
(610497) and BRCC3 (300617) enhanced ubiquitination by the complex, and
cancer-associated truncations in BRCA1 reduced the association of BRE
and BRCC3 with the complex. RNA interference of BRE and BRCC3 in HeLa
cells increased cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation and resulted in a
defect in G2/M checkpoint arrest. Dong et al. (2003) concluded that the
BRCC is a ubiquitin E3 ligase that enhances cellular survival following
DNA damage.

Yang et al. (2005) showed that a full-length Brca2 homolog (Brh2, from
the fungus Ustilago maydis) stimulates Rad51-mediated recombination at
substoichiometric concentrations relative to Rad51. Brh2 recruits Rad51
to DNA and facilitates the nucleation of the filament, which is then
elongated by the pool of free Rad51. Brh2 acts preferentially at a
junction between double-stranded DNA and single-stranded DNA, with
strict specificity for the 3-prime overhang polarity of a resected
double-stranded break. Yang et al. (2005) concluded that their results
established a BRCA2 function in RAD51-mediated double-stranded break
repair and explained the loss of this repair capacity in
BRCA2-associated cancers.

Enomoto et al. (2006) demonstrated that coexpression of human MND1
(611422) and HOP2 (608665) in E. coli resulted in the formation of
stable heterodimers that stimulated DMC1- and RAD51-mediated DNA strand
exchange. Chi et al. (2007) found that the Hop2 component of the mouse
recombinant Hop2-Mnd1 complex was the major DNA-binding subunit, and
that Mnd1 was the Rad51-interacting entity. Hop2-Mnd1 stabilized the
Rad51-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) nucleoprotein filament, and enhanced
the ability of the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament to capture duplex
DNA, which is an obligatory step in the formation of the synaptic
complex critical for DNA joint formation.

By combining optical tweezers with single-molecule fluorescence
microscopy and microfluidics, van Mameren et al. (2009) demonstrated
that disassembly of human RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments results from the
interplay between ATP hydrolysis and the release of the tension stored
in the filament. By applying external tension to the DNA, they found
that disassembly slows down and can even be stalled. The authors
quantified the fluorescence of RAD51 patches and found that disassembly
occurs in bursts interspersed by long pauses. After relaxation of a
stalled complex, pauses were suppressed resulting in a large burst. Van
Mameren et al. (2009) concluded that tension-dependent disassembly takes
place only from filament ends, after tension-independent ATP hydrolysis.

Using purified recombinant proteins, Tombline and Fishel (2002) showed
that human RAD51 had a 50-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency
compared to bacterial RecA and lacked the magnitude of ATP-induced
cooperativity that is a hallmark of RecA. Altering the ratio of
DNA/RAD51 and including salts that stimulate DNA strand exchange, such
as ammonium sulfate, were found to increase RAD51 catalytic efficiency.
RAD51 and RecA differed in the ability of ssDNA and dsDNA to induce
their ATPase activity and also showed differences in DNA site size.
RAD51 had a minimal site size of 3 nucleotides, but 6 to 8 nucleotides
of ssDNA per RAD51 monomer provoked optimal ATPase efficiency, whereas
RecA has a site size of 3 nucleotides for ssDNA.

Park et al. (2008) showed that RAD51-delta-ex9 showed approximately the
same DNA strand exchange activity as full-length RAD51 in vitro,
although it had significantly higher activity than RAD51 in homologous
DNA repair. Mutation analysis revealed that the unique C termini of
RAD51 and RAD51-delta-ex9 independently directed their nuclear
localization in transfected COS-7 cells.

Using Western blot analysis, Sage et al. (2010) found that mitochondrial
levels of RAD51, RAD51C, and XRCC3 in human cell lines increased in
response to oxidative stress and weak ionizing radiation.
Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that oxidative stress increased the
interaction of RAD51 with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and knockdown of
RAD51, via small interfering RNA, increased mtDNA copy number,
apparently due to general inhibition of cell cycle progression.
Oxidative stress normally increases mtDNA copy number; however,
knockdown of RAD51, RAD51C, or XRCC3 suppressed this stress response and
resulted in decreased mtDNA copy number. Sage et al. (2010) concluded
that proteins of the homologous recombination pathway are required to
maintain the mitochondrial genome.

Jensen et al. (2010) reported the purification of BRCA2 and showed that
it both binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by
promoting assembly of RAD51 onto ssDNA. BRCA2 acts by targeting RAD51 to
ssDNA over dsDNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA;
179835) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51 ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP
hydrolysis. BRCA2 does not anneal ssDNA complexed with RPA, implying it
does not directly function in repair processes that involve ssDNA
annealing. The findings of Jensen et al. (2010) showed that BRCA2 is a
key mediator of homologous recombination and provided a molecular basis
for understanding how this DNA repair process is disrupted by BRCA2
mutations.

For additional information on RAD51 and the BRCC protein complex that
performs DNA repair and recombination, see BRCA2 (600185).

Jirawatnotai et al. (2011) performed a series of proteomic screens for
cyclin D1 (168461) protein partners in several types of human tumors and
found that cyclin D1 directly binds RAD51 and that cyclin D1-RAD51
interaction is induced by radiation. Like RAD51, cyclin D1 is recruited
to DNA damage sites in a BRCA2-dependent fashion. Reduction of cyclin D1
levels in human cancer cells impaired recruitment of RAD51 to damaged
DNA, impeded the homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair, and
increased sensitivity of cells to radiation in vitro and in vivo. This
effect was seen in cancer cells lacking the retinoblastoma protein
(614041), which do not require D-cyclins for proliferation. Jirawatnotai
et al. (2011) concluded that their findings revealed an unexpected
function of a core cell-cycle protein in DNA repair and suggested that
targeting cyclin D1 may be beneficial also in retinoblastoma-negative
cancers, which were thought to be unaffected by cyclin D1 inhibition.

Long et al. (2011) reported that the broken sister chromatid generated
by a DNA double-strand break in Xenopus extracts is repaired via
RAD51-dependent strand invasion into the regenerated sister.
Recombination acts downstream of FANCI (611360)-FANCD2 (613984), yet
RAD51 binds interstrand crosslinks-stalled replication forks
independently of FANCI and FANC2 and before double-strand break
formation. Long et al. (2011) concluded that their results elucidated
the functional link between the Fanconi anemia pathway and the
recombination machinery during interstrand crosslink repair. In
addition, their results demonstrated the complete repair of a
double-strand break via homologous recombination in vitro.

In the developing mouse cortex, Depienne et al. (2012) found that
expression of the Rad51 gene was highest at embryonic day 12 (E12), and
was mostly detected in the cortical ventricular proliferative zone. The
Dcc gene (120470) was also expressed at this time, but in a different
location in the preplate postmitotic zone. In the cortex of newborn
mice, Rad51 was mainly present in the subplate and, in lesser amounts,
in layer V, whereas Dcc was selectively located in axons innervating the
cortex. Rad51 was also detected in a subpopulation of corticospinal
axons at the pyramidal decussation in 2-day-old mice. The subcellular
location of Rad51 also changes with development: at E12, it was mostly
detected in the nucleus of progenitor cells, whereas after birth, it was
mainly localized in the cell soma. The results suggested that Rrad51
could have several functions related to different cellular
localizations.

With use of a separation-of-function mutant form of Rad51 that retains
filament-forming but not joint molecule (JM)-forming activity in S.
cerevisiae,, Cloud et al. (2012) showed that the JM activity of Rad51 is
fully dispensable for meiotic recombination. The corresponding mutation
in Dmc1 (602721) causes a profound recombination defect, demonstrating
that Dmc1's JM activity alone is responsible for meiotic recombination.
Cloud et al. (2012) further provided biochemical evidence that Rad51
acts with Mei5-Sae3 as a Dmc1 accessory factor. Thus, Rad51 is a
multifunctional protein that catalyzes recombination directly in mitosis
and indirectly, via Dmc1, during meiosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Park et al. (2008) determined that the RAD51 gene contains 10 exons.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Slupianek et al. (2001) demonstrated that RAD51 is important for
resistance to cisplatin and mitomycin C in cells expressing the BCR
(151410)/ABL (189980) oncogenic tyrosine kinase. BCR/ABL significantly
enhanced the expression of RAD51 and several RAD51 paralogs. RAD51
overexpression was mediated by STAT5 (601511)-dependent transcription as
well as by inhibition of caspase-3 (600636)-dependent cleavage.
Phosphorylation of the RAD51 tyr315 residue by BCR/ABL appeared
essential for enhanced DSB repair and drug resistance.

- Crystal Structure

Pellegrini et al. (2002) reported the 1.7-angstrom crystal structure of
a complex between the BRC repeat, which is an evolutionarily conserved
sequence in BRCA2, and the RecA-homology domain of RAD51. The BRC repeat
mimics a motif in RAD51 that serves as an interface for oligomerization
between individual RAD51 monomers, thus enabling BRCA2 to control the
assembly of the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament, which is essential for
strand-pairing reactions during DNA recombination. The RAD51
oligomerization motif is highly conserved among RecA-like recombinases,
highlighting a common evolutionarily origin for the mechanism of
nucleoprotein filament formation, mirrored in the BRC repeat. Pellegrini
et al. (2002) showed that cancer-associated mutations that affect the
BRC repeat disrupt its predicted interaction with RAD51, yielding
structural insight into mechanisms for cancer susceptibility.

Chen et al. (2008) solved the crystal structures of the E. coli
RecA-ssDNA and RecA heteroduplex filaments. They showed that ssDNA and
ATP bind to RecA-RecA interfaces cooperatively, explaining the ATP
dependency of DNA binding. The ATP gamma-phosphate is sensed across the
RecA-RecA interface by 2 lysine residues that also stimulate ATP
hydrolysis, providing a mechanism for DNA release. The DNA is underwound
and stretched globally, but locally it adopts a B-DNA-like conformation
that restricts the homology search to Watson-Crick-type basepairing. The
complementary strand interacts primarily through basepairing, making
heteroduplex formation strictly dependent on complementarity. The
underwound, stretched filament conformation probably evolved to
destabilize the donor duplex, freeing the complementary strand for
homology sampling.

MAPPING

Shinohara et al. (1993) mapped the RAD51 gene to chromosome 15 by
analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and localized the mouse gene to
chromosome 2F1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

By FISH analysis, Takahashi et al. (1994) assigned the RAD51 gene to
chromosome 15q15.1 and the mouse gene to chromosome 2F1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Susceptibility to Breast Cancer

RAD51, a homolog of RecA of E. coli, functions in recombination and in
DNA repair. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins, implicated in familial breast
cancer, form a complex with RAD51, and these genes are thought to
participate in a common DNA damage response pathway associated with the
activation of homologous recombination and DSB repair. To investigate
the possibility that the RAD51 gene may be involved in the development
of hereditary breast cancer, Kato et al. (2000) screened Japanese
patients with hereditary breast cancer for RAD51 mutations and found a
single alteration in exon 6 (179617.0001). This was determined to be
present in the germline in 2 patients with bilateral breast cancer.

- Susceptibility to Mirror Movements 2

By exome sequencing of a large French family with congenital mirror
movements-2 (MRMV2; 614508) originally reported by Depienne et al.
(2011), Depienne et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous truncating
mutation in the RAD51 gene (179617.0003). The mutation was found in 8
affected individuals and in 8 unaffected individuals, indicating
significant incomplete penetrance (50%). A second truncating mutation in
the RAD51 gene (179617.0004) was identified in a German family with the
disorder. The authors concluded that haploinsufficiency was the
pathogenic mechanism. The mechanism linking RAD1 deficiency to the
disorder was unclear: insufficient RAD51-related DNA repair during early
corticogenesis might lead to excessive apoptosis and altered central
nervous system development; however, the authors noted that RAD51 may
have a direct or indirect role in axonal guidance.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using targeted gene mutation in embryonic stem (ES) cells, Tsuzuki et
al. (1996) introduced a small deletion into an essential region of the
mouse Rad51 gene and transmitted the mutation through mouse germ-cell
lines. Mice heterozygous for the mutation were viable and fertile. The
authors identified no Rad51 -/- pups among 148 neonates examined.
However, a few Rad51 -/- embryos were identified when examined during
the early stages of embryonic development. No Rad51 -/- ES cells were
detected under selective growth conditions. Tsuzuki et al. (1996)
concluded that the Rad51 protein plays an essential role in the
proliferation of cells and that a basic molecular defect present in the
Rad51 -/- embryos interferes with cell viability, leading to
pre-implantation lethality. The homozygous Rad51 null mutation can be
characterized as a preimplantational lethal mutation that disrupts basic
molecular functions of cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BREAST CANCER, FAMILIAL
RAD51, ARG150GLN

In studies of 20 patients from breast cancer (114480) families and 25
patients with breast cancer that was early-onset, bilateral, or
accompanied by a history of primary cancer(s) of other organs, Kato et
al. (2000) found a missense mutation in 2 patients with familial breast
cancer: a G-to-A transition converting codon 150 from CGG (arg) to CAG
(gln). Both patients had bilateral breast cancer, one with synchronous
bilateral breast cancer and the other with synchronous bilateral
multiple breast cancer. The patients were presumed to be unrelated.

.0002
BREAST CANCER, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, IN BRCA1 AND BRCA2 CARRIERS
RAD51, 135G-C

Wang et al. (1999) presented evidence that a single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) in the 5-prime untranslated region of RAD51 is
associated with increased breast cancer risk in BRCA1 (113705) and BRCA2
(600185) carriers but does not influence breast cancer risk in women who
are not BRCA1 or BRCA2 carriers. This SNP, designated 135g/c, is a
substitution of C for G at position 135 in the RAD51 cDNA. Levy-Lahad et
al. (2001) studied 257 female Ashkenazi Jewish carriers of one of the
common BRCA1 (185delAG; 113705.0003, or 5382insC; 113705.0018) or BRCA2
(6174delT; 600185.0009) mutations. They found that the 135 SNP modified
cancer risk in BRCA2 carriers but not in BRCA1 carriers. Survival
analysis in BRCA2 carriers showed that 135C increased risk of breast
and/or ovarian cancer with a hazard ratio (HR) of 4.0. This effect was
largely due to increased breast cancer risk with an HR of 3.46 for
breast cancer in BRCA2 carriers who were 135C heterozygotes. RAD51
status did not affect ovarian cancer risk.

Antoniou et al. (2007) pooled genotype data for 8,512 female carriers
from 19 studies for the RAD51 135G-C SNP. They found evidence of an
increased breast cancer risk in CC homozygotes (hazard ratio 1.92; 95%
confidence interval 1.25-2.94) but not in heterozygotes. When BRCA1 and
BRCA2 mutation carriers were analyzed separately, the increased risk was
statistically significant only among BRCA2 mutation carriers, in whom
they observed hazard ratios of 1.17 (95% confidence interval 0.91-1.51)
among heterozygotes and 3.18 (95% confidence interval 1.39-7.27) among
rare homozygotes. In addition, they determined that the 135G-C variant
affects RAD51 splicing within the 5-prime untranslated region. Thus,
135G-C may modify the risk of breast cancer in BRCA2 mutation carriers
by altering the expression of RAD51. Antoniou et al. (2007) stated that
RAD51 was the first gene to be reliably identified as a modifier of risk
among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

.0003
MIRROR MOVEMENTS 2, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
RAD51, ARG254TER

In 8 affected members of a large 4-generation French family with
congenital mirror movements-2 (MRMV2; 614508) (Depienne et al., 2011),
Depienne et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 760C-T transition in
exon 8 of the RAD51 gene, resulting in an arg254-to-ter (R254X)
substitution. The mutation was not found in 644 controls, but it was
found in 8 unaffected family members, indicating striking incomplete
penetrance (50%). The mutation was found by exome sequencing. RAD51 mRNA
was significantly downregulated due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay,
indicating haploinsufficiency as the pathogenic mechanism.

.0004
MIRROR MOVEMENTS 2
RAD51, 1-BP DUP, 855A

In a German mother and son with congenital mirror movements-2 (MRMV2;
614508) (Depienne et al., 2011), Depienne et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous 1-bp duplication (855dupA) in exon 9 of the RAD51 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The mutation was
not found in 644 controls.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

CD40 (109535) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)
family. The short cytoplasmic domain of CD40 contains a region with
limited homology to the conserved cytosolic death domain of TNFR1
(191190) and FAS (134637). Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay with the
cytoplasmic domain of CD40 as bait, Hu et al. (1994) isolated B-cell
cDNAs encoding a protein that they called CD40-binding protein (CD40bp).
The predicted CD40bp protein contains a RING finger DNA-binding motif, a
cys/his-rich region, and a coiled-coil domain. Like TRAF1 (601711) and
TRAF2 (601895), both TNFR2 (75-kD TNFR; 191191)-binding proteins, CD40bp
contains a C-terminal TRAF domain. In vitro translated CD40bp has an
apparent molecular mass of 64 kD. Coimmunoprecipitation studies
indicated that CD40bp interacts with CD40 in human B cells. Hu et al.
(1994) suggested that CD40bp, along with TRAF1 and TRAF2, comprise a
family of proteins that associate with the cytoplasmic faces of the TNFR
family and have in common a TRAF domain.

Independently, Sato et al. (1995) and Cheng et al. (1995) identified
CD40bp, designating it CAP1 (CD40-associated protein-1) and CRAF1 (CD40
receptor-associated factor 1), respectively. Sato et al. (1995)
demonstrated that CAP1 binds specifically to the cytoplasmic domain of
CD40, but not to that of TNFR1, TNFR2, or FAS. The C-terminal TRAF
domain of CAP1 was sufficient to mediate binding to CD40 and
homodimerization. Cheng et al. (1995) isolated mouse and human CRAF1
cDNAs. The predicted 568-amino acid human protein is 96% identical to
mouse CRAF1. These authors divided the TRAF domain into 2 regions:
TRAF-N, the more N-terminal coiled-coil subdomain, and TRAF-C, which was
necessary and sufficient for CRAF1 to interact with CD40. Overexpression
of a truncated cDNA encoding the entire TRAF domain of CRAF1 inhibited
CD40-mediated upregulation of the CD23 (151445) gene, which suggested to
Cheng et al. (1995) that CRAF1 participates in CD40 signaling.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the TRAF3 gene to chromosome 14q32.32 based on an
alignment of the TRAF3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC075086) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

The cytoplasmic C terminus of the Epstein-Barr virus latent infection
membrane protein-1 (LMP1) is essential for B lymphocyte growth
transformation. LMP1 is an integral membrane protein that has
transforming effects in nonlymphoid cells, and may act by constitutively
activating a common cellular growth factor receptor pathway. Mosialos et
al. (1995) found that CD40bp, which they called LAP1 (LMP1-associated
protein-1), interacted with the LMP1 C-terminal domain. Expression of
LMP1 caused LAP1 and TRAF1 (EBI6) to localize to LMP1 clusters in
lymphoblast plasma membranes, and LMP1 coimmunoprecipitated with these
proteins in cell extracts. LAP1 bound to the cytoplasmic domains of CD40
and LT-beta-R (600979) in vitro, and associated with p80 (TNFR2) in
vivo. Northern blot analysis revealed that LAP1 was expressed as a
full-length 2.8-kb mRNA and an alternatively spliced 1.8-kb mRNA in all
tissues tested. Mosialos et al. (1995) concluded that the interaction of
LAP1 with LMP1 and with the cytoplasmic domains of TNFR family members
is evidence for a central role of this protein as an effector of cell
growth or death signaling pathways.

Dadgostar et al. (2003) determined that the coiled-coil domain of mouse
T3jam (608255) interacted with the isoleucine zipper domain of Traf3.
T3jam did not associate with other Traf family members. Coexpression of
T3jam and Traf3 recruited Traf3 to the detergent-insoluble fraction, and
T3jam and Traf3 synergistically activated JNK (601158), but not nuclear
factor kappa-B (see 164011).

To dissect biochemically Toll-like receptor signaling, Hacker et al.
(2006) established a system for isolating signaling complexes assembled
by dimerized adaptors. Using MyD88 (602170) as a prototypic adaptor,
they identified TRAF3 as a new component of Toll/interleukin-1 receptor
signaling complexes that is recruited along with TRAF6 (602355). Using
myeloid cells from Traf3- and Traf6-deficient mice, Hacker et al. (2006)
demonstrated that TRAF3 is essential for the induction of type I
interferons and the antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL10;
124092), but is dispensable for expression of proinflammatory cytokines.
In fact, Traf3-deficient cells overproduced proinflammatory cytokines
owing to defective Il10 production. Despite their structural similarity,
the functions of TRAF3 and TRAF6 are largely distinct. TRAF3 is also
recruited to the adaptor TRIF (607601) and is required for marshalling
the protein kinase TBK1 (604834) into Toll/interleukin-1 receptor
signaling complexes, thereby explaining its unique role in activation of
the interferon response.

Oganesyan et al. (2006) demonstrated that cells lacking TRAF3 are
defective in type I interferon responses activated by several different
Toll-like receptors. Furthermore, they showed that TRAF3 associates with
the Toll-like receptor adaptors TRIF and IRAK1 (300283), as well as
downstream IRF3/7 kinases TBK1 and IKK-epsilon (605048), suggesting that
TRAF3 serves as a critical link between Toll-like receptor adaptors and
downstream regulatory kinases important for IRF activation. In addition
to TLR stimulation, Oganesyan et al. (2006) showed that TRAF3-deficient
fibroblasts are defective in their type I interferon response to direct
infection with vesicular stomatitis virus, indicating that TRAF3 is also
an important component of TLR-independent viral recognition pathways.
Oganesyan et al. (2006) concluded that TRAF3 is a major regulator of
type I interferon production and the innate antiviral response.

Production of type I interferon is a critical host defense triggered by
pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system.
Kayagaki et al. (2007) demonstrated that reduction of DUBA (300713)
augmented the PRR-induced type I interferon response in transfected
HEK293 cells, whereas ectopic expression of DUBA had the converse
effect. DUBA bound TRAF3, an adaptor protein essential for type I
interferon response. TRAF3 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that preferentially
assembled lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains in cotransfection assays.
DUBA selectively cleaved the lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains on TRAF3,
resulting in its dissociation from the downstream signaling complex
containing TBK1. A discrete ubiquitin interaction motif within DUBA was
required for efficient deubiquitination of TRAF3 and optimal suppression
of type I interferon. Kayagaki et al. (2007) concluded that their data
identified DUBA as a negative regulator of innate immune responses.

Cytokine signaling is thought to require assembly of multicomponent
signaling complexes at cytoplasmic segments of membrane-embedded
receptors, in which receptor-proximal protein kinases are activated.
Matsuzawa et al. (2008) reported that, upon ligation, CD40 formed a
complex containing adaptor molecules TRAF2 and TRAF3,
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13 (UBE2N; 603679), cellular inhibitor
of apoptosis protein-1 (CIAP1, or BIRC2; 601712) and -2 (CIAP2, or
BIRC3; 601721), IKK-gamma (IKBKG; 300248), and MEKK1 (MAP3K1; 600982).
TRAF2, UBC13, and IKK-gamma were required for complex assembly and
activation of MEKK1 and MAP kinase cascades. However, the kinases were
not activated unless the complex was translocated from the membrane to
the cytosol upon CIAP1/CIAP2-induced degradation of TRAF3. Matsuzawa et
al. (2008) proposed that this 2-stage signaling mechanism may apply to
other innate immune receptors and may account for spatial and temporal
separation of MAPK and IKK signaling.

Hu et al. (2013) identified the deubiquitinase OTUD7B (611748) as a
pivotal regulator of the noncanonical NF-kappa-B pathway. OTUD7B
deficiency in mice has no appreciable effect on canonical NF-kappa-B
activation but causes hyperactivation of noncanonical NF-kappa-B. In
response to noncanonical NF-kappa-B stimuli, OTUD7B binds and
deubiquitinates TRAF3, thereby inhibiting TRAF3 proteolysis and
preventing aberrant noncanonical NF-kappa-B activation. Consequently,
the OTUD7B deficiency results in B-cell hyperresponsiveness to antigens,
lymphoid follicular hyperplasia in the intestinal mucosa, and elevated
host-defense ability against an intestinal bacterial pathogen,
Citrobacter rodentium. Hu et al. (2013) concluded that their findings
established OTUD7B as a crucial regulator of signal-induced noncanonical
NF-kappa-B activation, and indicated a mechanism of immune regulation
that involves OTUD7B-mediated deubiquitination and stabilization of
TRAF3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Braggio et al. (2009) identified biallelic inactivation of TRAF3 in 3
(5.3%) of 57 Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM; see 153600) samples.
TRAF3 inactivation was associated with transcriptional activation of
NF-kappa-B (NFKB1; 164011). In addition, 1 of 24 patients with a 6q
deletion had an inactivating somatic mutation in TNFAIP3 (191163),
another negative regulator of NF-kappa-B. Monoallelic deletions of
chromosome 6q23, including the TNFAIP3 gene, were identified in 38% of
patients, suggesting that haploinsufficiency can predispose to the
development of WM. The results indicated that mutational activation of
the NF-kappa-B pathway plays a role in the pathogenesis of WM.

Perez de Diego et al. (2010) investigated an 18-year-old French female
who had suffered from herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE; 614849) at age 4
years and who lacked mutations in either the UNC93B1 (608204) or TLR3
(603029) genes. They identified a heterozygous C-to-T substitution at
position 352 in exon 4 of the TRAF3 gene, resulting in a nonconservative
missense change, arg118 to trp (R118W; 601896.0001). The mutation was
not found in her parents or brothers, and none had a history of HSE.
RT-PCR analysis of the patient's cells detected normal levels of TRAF3
mRNA, but Western blot analysis showed severely reduced levels of TRAF3
protein. Responsiveness to TLR3 agonists was impaired, as indicated by
deficient NFKB activation and poor production of IFNB (147640), IFNL
(IL29; 607403), and IL6 (147620). Expression of wildtype and mutant
alleles in cell lines showed that the mutant was dominant-negative.
TRAF3-deficient fibroblasts had impaired type I and type III
IFN-dependent control of viruses and deficient responses through the
TNFR (e.g., TNFRSF5; 109535) pathways. Perez de Diego et al. (2010)
concluded that, whereas complete Traf3 deficiency is neonatal lethal in
mice, decreases in TRAF3 production and function result in
predisposition to HSE, a condition that is usually fatal if untreated.

herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE; 614849) at age 4 years who was healthy
without prophylaxis and showed normal resistance to other infectious
diseases, including other herpesvirus family members, at age 18 years.
They identified a de novo heterozygous 352C-T transition in exon 4 of
the TRAF3 gene, resulting in an arg118-to-trp (R118W) substitution, in
this patient, whose HSE was successfully treated with acyclovir for 3
weeks.

602893	TITLE *602893 KILLER CELL LECTIN-LIKE RECEPTOR, SUBFAMILY C, MEMBER 4; KLRC4
;;NKG2F
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Plougastel and Trowsdale (1997) identified a gene located 25 kb from the
3-prime end of NKG2A (161555) that they designated NKG2F. By genomic
sequencing and RT-PCR, they determined that the complete NKG2D (611817)
transcript is a splice variant of NKG2F that shares the same first 4
exons. There is a consensus splice donor site within the fourth exon. In
the long 13-exon NKG2D mRNA this donor site is spliced to exon 5. In the
shorter NKG2F cDNA, the donor site is not used, and the fourth exon
contains an additional 245 bp. Sequence analysis showed that both
transcripts could encode the same predicted 158-amino acid protein, and
that the second open reading frame spanning the last 6 exons of NKG2D is
probably not translated. The NKG2F/NKG2D protein does not contain an
extracellular lectin domain, but does have a 24-amino acid motif in the
extracellular region that is 100% identical to that of other NKG2 family
members.

Glienke et al. (1998) confirmed that, in some cases, part of the fourth
exon of NKG2F is spliced to the 5-prime end of NKG2D, which has only a
low similarity to the other NKG2 genes. They noted, however, that
additional NKG2D cDNAs have been isolated that do not encompass any
NKG2F sequences, suggesting that a functional NKG2D-specific promoter
exists.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, Kim et al. (2004) showed that
NKG2F was expressed intracellularly in natural killer (NK) cells.
Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed failure of NKG2F to associate with
CD94 (KLRD1; 602894), possibly explaining the lack of surface
expression. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated association of NKG2F
with DAP12 (TYROBP; 604142), indicating activation potential. However,
phosphorylation did not occur on tyrosine in the immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) of NKG2F, suggesting that the
motif is a mock ITIM. Kim et al. (2004) concluded that NKG2F may have
as-yet-unidentified partners and functions or that it may be a vestigial
gene product.

GENE STRUCTURE

Glienke et al. (1998) determined that the NKG2C (602891), NKG2E
(602892), and NKG2F genes are highly similar except for variability at
their 3-prime ends. The NKG2C gene contains 6 exons, whereas NKG2E has 7
exons and NKG2F has only 4 exons.

MAPPING

By analysis of a cosmid contig, Plougastel and Trowsdale (1998) found
that the NKG2F and NKG2D genes and other members of the NKG2 gene family
are clustered within 350 kb on chromosome 12p13.2-p12.3. This cluster is
located within the NK complex, a region that contains C-type lectin
genes preferentially expressed on NK cells.

601883	TITLE *601883 DNA FRAGMENTATION FACTOR, 40-KD, BETA SUBUNIT; DFFB
;;DFF2;;
DFF40;;
DEOXYRIBONUCLEASE III, CASPASE-ACTIVATED;;
CASPASE-ACTIVATED DNase; CAD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The DFFB protein is activated during apoptosis and mediates
cell-autonomous apoptotic DNA degradation (summary by Kawane et al.,
2003).

CLONING

By screening human cDNA libraries for sequences similar to that of mouse
caspase-activated DNase (Cad), Mukae et al. (1998) isolated a human CAD
cDNA. The overall identity of human CAD to mouse CAD was 75.9% at the
amino acid sequence level. The positions of 10 cysteine residues were
conserved between human and mouse CAD proteins The human CAD cDNA was
found to be expressed in cells that easily undergo DNA fragmentation in
response to apoptotic stimuli, but not in those that do not show
apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Introduction of a CAD expression vector
resulted in enhanced DNA fragmentation. Northern blot analysis showed
that CAD mRNA is expressed in a limited number of human tissues,
including pancreas, spleen, prostate, and ovary.

GENE FUNCTION

Apoptosis is a cell death process that removes toxic and/or useless
cells during mammalian development. The apoptotic process is accompanied
by shrinkage and fragmentation of the cells and nuclei and degradation
of the chromosomal DNA into nucleosomal units. The DNA fragmentation
factor (DFF) described by Liu et al. (1997) is a heterodimer of 40-kD
(DFFB) and 45-kD (DFFA; 601882) subunits. The authors showed that DFFA
is the substrate for caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636) and triggers DNA
fragmentation during apoptosis.

Liu et al. (1998) reported the reconstitution of a pathway that leads to
the apoptotic changes in nuclei by using recombinant DNA fragmentation
factor. Coexpression of the 40- and 45-kD subunits was required to
generate recombinant DFF, which becomes activated when DFF45 is cleaved
by caspase-3. The cleaved fragments of DFF45 dissociate from the DFF40,
the active component of DFF. Purified DFF40 exhibited an intrinsic DNase
activity that was markedly stimulated by chromatin-associated proteins
histone H1 and high mobility group proteins. DFF40 also triggered
chromatin condensation when incubated with nuclei. These data suggested
that DFF40 is sufficient to trigger both DNA fragmentation and chromatin
condensation during apoptosis.

Binding of the Fas ligand (FASL; 134638), also known as apoptosis
antigen ligand-1 (APT1LG1), a member of the tumor necrosis factor
family, to its receptor Fas (134637), also known as apoptosis antigen 1
(APT1), causes trimerization of the receptor (summary by Mukae et al.,
1998). The trimerized receptor recruits caspase-8 (CASP8; 601763), also
known as apoptosis-related cysteine protease, through the adaptor
molecule FADD (602457), which stands for 'Fas-associating protein with
death domain;' the trimerized receptor activates CASP8 at the plasma
membrane by forming the death-inducing signaling complex. Activated
CASP8 sequentially activates other members of the caspase family, such
as CASP3 and CASP6 (601532), which act downstream in the caspase
cascade. The activated caspases then cleave various cellular substrates
to cause the morphologic cellular changes observed during apoptosis. The
CAD DNase can be activated by CASP3 and is involved in the degradation
of chromosomal DNA into nucleosomal units during apoptosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Judson et al. (2000) found that the DFFB gene contains 7 coding exons
spanning 10 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Mukae et al. (1998) localized the functional CAD gene to
1p36.3.

By FISH, Judson et al. (2000) showed that DFFB lies distal to DFFA. They
also mapped a processed DFFB pseudogene to chromosome 9.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Judson et al. (2000) performed exhaustive mutation screening of 41
neuroblastomas and other tumors in which a 1p36 tumor suppressor gene
had been implicated; no tumor-specific mutations were found. A coding
region polymorphism was used to demonstrate uniformly biallelic
expression in human fetal DFFB transcripts. Since the putative
neuroblastoma tumor suppressor gene in distal 1p36 is predicted to be
maternally expressed, the lack of imprinting and absence of somatic
mutations in DFFB indicate that it probably is not the neuroblastoma
tumor suppressor gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kawane et al. (2003) generated healthy mice deficient in Cad. Cad -/-
thymocytes did not produce DNase activity in response to Casp3, which
cleaves the Cad binding partner, Icad (DFFA), and the cells did not
undergo apoptosis. However, embryonic thymic macrophages from wildtype
mice, but not from DNase2 (126350)-deficient mice, were capable of
digesting the nuclei and degrading the DNA of both wildtype and Cad -/-
thymocytes. Kawane et al. (2003) concluded that CAD in apoptotic cells
and DNASE2 in macrophages cooperatively degrade DNA in apoptotic cells.
The thymus was much smaller and less cellular in Dnase2 -/- mice than in
Cad -/- or wildtype mice and contained many foci with undigested DNA.
Kidney defects were also noted in mice lacking Dnase2. Expression of
Ifna1 (147660) and Ifnb (147640) was not detectable in Cad-deficient
mice, but both Ifnb and Ifng (147570) were upregulated in
Dnase2-deficient mice and even more upregulated in double-knockout
animals, suggesting that undigested DNA from apoptotic cells can
activate innate immunity leading to defects in thymic development.

;;p78
MICROSPHERULE PROTEIN, 58-KD, INCLUDED; MSP58, INCLUDED;;
MICROSPHERULE PROTEIN 2, INCLUDED; MCRS2, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 protein ICP22 as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, followed by screening a
HeLa cell cDNA library, Bruni and Roizman (1998) cloned MCRS1, which
they designated p78. The deduced 534-amino acid protein contains
potential nuclear localization signals in its N-terminal half and a
leucine zipper region in its C-terminal half. Western blot analysis
detected a major p78 doublet at about 78 kD and minor bands at about 62
and 55 kD. In vitro transcription-translation of p78 cDNA resulted in a
55-kD protein, suggesting that the bands at 78 kD represent highly
modified proteins. Western blot analysis of synchronized HeLa cells
detected p78 expression only in early S phase. It was not expressed in
nondividing HeLa cells or human foreskin fibroblasts. Immunolocalization
of p78 in HeLa cells detected the protein predominantly in nuclei.
However, in Hep-2 liver carcinoma cells, p78 localized to both nuclei
and cytoplasm, and in HSV-infected Hep-2 cells, it localized in a few
dense nuclear bodies or at the nuclear membrane.

By yeast 2-hybrid screening using NOL1 (164031) as bait, followed by PCR
of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Ren et al. (1998) cloned MSP58. The deduced
462-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 51.8 kD and
shares 96.8% amino acid identity with mouse Msp58. The N-terminal half
of MSP58 contains a serine-rich region, a nucleolar localization signal,
and a monopartite nuclear localization signal, and the C-terminal half
contains a coiled-coil region. Northern blot analysis detected a major
1.9-kb MSP58 transcript in all 8 tissues examined, with highest
expression in testis and lowest expression in colon. Western blot
analysis detected a 58-kD MSP58 protein in fractionated HeLa cell
nucleoli. Double-immunolabeling experiments found MSP58 within nucleolar
microspherules, where it colocalized with fibrillarin (FBL; 134795).

Using the telomerase-inhibitory protein LPTS (PINX1; 606505) as bait in
a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a brain cDNA library, Song et al. (2004)
cloned an MCRS1 variant that they designated MCRS2. The deduced MCRS2
protein contains 475 amino acids. Song et al. (2004) determined that the
MCRS1/p78, MSP58, and MCRS2 proteins differ only in their N termini and
are likely the products of variable spliced transcripts. All 3 isoforms
have a C-terminal forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, which mediates
protein-protein interactions and is associated with transcriptional
regulation, DNA repair, and cell-cycle progression. PCR analysis
detected MCRS1 and MCRS2 expression in brain and liver cDNA libraries. A
human hepatoma cell line expressed MCRS2 protein only in early S phase.

GENE FUNCTION

Bruni and Roizman (1998) found that p78 interacted specifically with the
HSV-1 protein ICP22 in nuclear extracts prepared from HSV-infected HeLa
cells.

Using truncation mutants in a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Ren et al. (1998)
determined that the C-terminal half of MCRS1 contains the NOL1-binding
site. Overexpression of MSP58 in COS-7 cells caused a 15-fold increase
in nucleolar volume. Inhibition of pre-rRNA transcription by actinomycin
D caused a relocalization of MSP58 from nucleolar microspherules to
'caps' containing the fibrillar centers. ELISA of sucrose density
fractions of HeLa cell nuclear extracts demonstrated comigration of
MSP58, fibrillarin, and NOL1 in nucleolar particulates.

Lin and Shih (2002) found that MSP58 interacted with DAXX (603186), an
adaptor protein associated with FAS (TNFRSF6; 134637) signaling and
caspase-independent cell death. DAXX interacted with MSP58 in vitro and
in vivo, and MSP58 overexpression correlated with sequestration of DAXX
from a diffuse nuclear distribution to the nucleolus. MSP58
overexpression relieved DAXX-mediated transcriptional repression. Lin
and Shih (2002) concluded that translocation of the MSP58-DAXX complex
to the nucleolus results in derepression of DAXX-regulated genes.

By in vitro pull-down assays, Song et al. (2004) confirmed an
interaction between MCRS2 and LPTS. The 2 proteins colocalized in
transfected cells, particularly in nucleoli and more weakly at telomere
speckles. The N-terminal 216 amino acids of MCRS2 were sufficient to
direct telomere localization. Overexpression of this MCRS2 N-terminal
region in a hepatoma cell line caused progressive shortening of
telomeres during passage, whereas control cells maintained telomere
length. Song et al. (2004) found that MCRS2 also associated with TERT
(187270) and inhibited telomerase activity in vitro in a
concentration-dependent manner.

By immunoprecipitation analysis, Shimono et al. (2005) found that MCRS1
interacted with MI2-beta (CHD4; 603277), RFP (TRIM27; 602165), and UBF
(UBTF; 600673). Yeast 2-hybrid screening showed that the central region
of MCRS1 interacted with the ATPase/helicase region of MI2-beta and the
coiled-coil region of RFP. Confocal microscopy demonstrated
colocalization of MCRS1, MI2-beta, RFP, and UBF in nucleoli. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays showed that MCRS1, MI2-beta, and RFP
associated with rDNA and were involved in transactivation of ribosomal
gene transcription, which could be downregulated by small interfering
RNA-mediated downregulation of MCRS1, MI2-beta, and RFP. Shimono et al.
(2005) concluded that MI2-beta and RFP, which are involved in
transcriptional repression in the nucleus, associate with MCRS1 in the
nucleolus and are involved in activation of rRNA transcription.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MCRS1
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP RH77809).

;;LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR-RELATED PROTEIN 7; LRP7;;
LR3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family are cell
surface proteins that bind and internalize ligands in the process of
receptor-mediated endocytosis. To identify candidate genes for the type
I diabetes IDDM4 (600319) locus in 11q13, Hey et al. (1998) constructed
an approximately 200-kb cosmid and BAC contig of this region. By DNA
sequencing and by searching sequence databases, they identified a novel
member of the LDLR family, which they named LDLR-related protein-5
(LRP5). The LRP5 cDNA encodes a deduced 1,615-amino acid protein
containing conserved modules characteristic of the LDLR family,
including a putative signal peptide, 4 epidermal growth factor (EGF)
repeats with associated spacer domains, 3 LDLR repeats, a single
transmembrane-spanning domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. The
extracellular domain of LRP5 contains 6 potential N-linked glycosylation
sites. Of the known family members, LRP5 is most closely related to LRP1
(107770). However, LRP5 has a unique organization of EGF and LDLR
repeats compared to other LDLR family members and likely represents a
new category in this family. Northern blot analysis detected an
approximately 5.1- to 5.6-kb LRP5 mRNA in a variety of human tissues,
with the highest level of expression in the liver.

Hey et al. (1998) cloned a mouse Lrp5 cDNA and found that the deduced
protein is 94% identical to human LRP5. Using immunohistochemistry in
Lrp5 knockout mice, Kato et al. (2002) determined that Lrp5 is expressed
in the osteoblasts lining the endosteal and trabecular bone surfaces.

Independently, Dong et al. (1998) isolated an LRP5 cDNA from a human
osteoblast cDNA library. The authors designated the encoded protein LR3
to reflect its 3 ligand-binding domains. Dot blot analysis of a variety
of human adult and fetal tissues detected highest LR3 expression in the
aorta, and Northern blot analysis detected a 5.4-kb LR3 message in all
human tissues examined except the brain. Dong et al. (1998) demonstrated
that mouse NIH 3T3 cells transfected with LRP5 show increased cell
proliferation.

In situ studies of rat tibia by Little et al. (2002) showed expression
of LRP5 in areas of bone involved in remodeling. Northern blot analysis
revealed that LRP5 was transcribed in human bone tissue as well as in
numerous other tissues.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Hey et al. (1998) mapped a
mouse BAC clone containing the Lrp5 gene to chromosome 19, which shows
homology of synteny with human 11q13. Chen et al. (1999) mapped the
human LRP5 gene to 11q13.4 by FISH and between markers D11S24270 and
D11S1975 by radiation hybrid mapping. They mapped the mouse Lrp5 gene to
chromosome 19B by FISH.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Gong et al. (2001) determined that the
LRP5 gene contains 23 coding exons and spans more than 100 kb. Twells et
al. (2001) determined that the LRP5 gene spans 160 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Gong et al. (2001) demonstrated LRP5 expression by osteoblasts in situ
and showed that LRP5 can transduce Wnt signaling in vitro via the
canonical pathway. They further showed that a mutant secreted form of
Lrp5 could reduce bone thickness in mouse calvarial explant cultures.
These data indicated that Wnt-mediated signaling via LRP5 affects bone
accrual during growth and is important for the establishment of peak
bone mass.

Mao et al. (2001) identified axin (603816) as a protein that interacts
with the intracellular domain of LRP5. LRP5, when expressed in
fibroblast cells, showed no effect on the canonical Wnt signaling
pathway by itself, but acted synergistically with Wnt. In contrast, LRP5
mutants lacking the extracellular domain functioned as constitutively
active forms that bound axin and that induced LEF1 (153245) activation
by destabilizing axin and stabilizing beta-catenin (116806). Addition of
Wnt caused the translocation of axin to the membrane and enhanced the
interaction between axin and LRP5. In addition, the LRP5 sequences
involved in interactions with axin were found to be required for LEF1
activation. The authors concluded that the binding of axin to LRP5 is an
important part of the Wnt signal transduction pathway. LRP5 also acts as
a target for the inhibitory effects of Dickkopf (DKK1; 605189), another
developmental protein, on Wnt signaling.

Semenov et al. (2005) found that human SOST (605740) antagonized Wnt
signaling in Xenopus embryos and mammalian cells by binding to the
extracellular domains of the Wnt coreceptors Lrp5 and Lrp6 (603507) and
disrupting Wnt-induced frizzled (see 603408)-Lrp complex formation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Twells et al. (2003) identified 95 SNPs within a 269-kb region
containing LRP5 and its 3 flanking genes in several families of white
European origin. They found a high level of recombination across LRP5,
including a hotspot region from intron 1 to intron 7, where there were
109 recombinants/Mb (4,882 meioses), in contrast to flanking regions of
14.6 recombinants/Mb.

- Osteoporosis-Pseudoglioma Syndrome

Gong et al. (2001) showed that LRP5 affects bone mass accrual during
growth and identified mutations in the LRP5 gene (e.g., 603506.0001)
that cause autosomal recessive osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome (OPPG;
259770). They found that obligate carriers of mutant LRP5 genes had
reduced bone mass when compared to age- and gender-matched controls.

Ai et al. (2005) sequenced the coding exons of LRP5 in 37 probands
suspected of having OPPG on the basis of the co-occurrence of severe
congenital or childhood-onset visual impairment with bone fragility or
osteoporosis recognized by young adulthood. They found 2 putative mutant
alleles in 26 probands, only 1 mutant allele in 4 probands, and no
mutant alleles in 7 probands. Looking for digenic inheritance, they
sequenced the genes encoding the functionally related receptor LRP6
(603507), an LRP5 coreceptor FZD4 (604579), and the LRP5 ligand norrin
(NDP; 300658), in the 4 probands with 1 mutant allele, and, looking for
locus heterogeneity, they sequenced FZD4 and NDP in the 7 probands with
no mutations; no additional mutations were found. They compared clinical
features between probands with and without LRP5 mutations and found no
difference in the severity of skeletal disease, prevalence of cognitive
impairment, or family history of consanguinity. However, 4 of the 7
probands without detectable mutations had eye pathology that differed
from pathology previously described for OPPG. Since many LRP5 mutations
are missense changes, to differentiate between a disease-causing
mutation and a benign variant Ai et al. (2005) measured the ability of
wildtype and mutant LRP5 to transduce Wnt (see 164820) and Norrin signal
ex vivo. Each of the 7 OPPG mutations tested had reduced signal
transduction compared with wildtype mutations. These results indicated
that early bilateral vitreoretinal eye pathology coupled with skeletal
fragility is a strong predictor of LRP5 mutation and that mutations in
LRP5 cause OPPG by impairing WNT and Norrin signal transduction.

Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (see EVR1; 133780) is an inherited
disorder of retinal vessel development (Benson, 1995). EVR1 is caused by
mutation in the FZD4 gene (604579) on chromosome 11q14.2 and has been
demonstrated in many of the linked families. The LRP5 gene on chromosome
11q13.4 came under suspicion as a candidate gene for FEVR because of
involvement of the eyes in some disorders, notably OPPG, which are
caused by LRP5 mutation. In affected members of 6 different families
with autosomal dominant EVR4 (601813), Toomes et al. (2004) identified 6
different heterozygous mutations in the LRP5 gene (see, e.g.,
603506.0020-603506.0021).

Jiao et al. (2004) studied 3 consanguineous families of European descent
in which autosomal recessive FEVR was diagnosed in multiple individuals.
Sequencing of LRP5 showed, in all 3 families, homozygosity for mutation
in LRP5: R570Q (603506.0022), R752G (603506.0023), and E1367K
(603506.0024). Thus, mutations in the LRP5 gene can cause autosomal
recessive as well as autosomal dominant FEVR.

Qin et al. (2005) identified 9 novel mutations in the LRP5 gene (see,
e.g., 603506.0025-602506.0028) in Japanese patients with FEVR. Four
families showed autosomal dominant inheritance, and 2 families showed
autosomal recessive inheritance. One family was found to have a
heterozygous mutation in the LRP5 gene (603506.0026) and a heterozygous
mutation in the FZD4 gene (604579.0003) on the same chromosome. Qin et
al. (2005) also found that patients with mutations in the LRP5 gene
showed reduced bone mineral density and suggested that it is a common
feature in patients with EVR4. Qin et al. (2005) proposed that OPPG and
EVR4 are part of a single phenotypic spectrum with both ocular and bone
manifestations.

Using standard PCR-based sequencing, Narumi et al. (2010) analyzed the
LRP5 gene in 4 male Japanese patients with typical skeletal and ocular
features of OPPG and identified compound heterozygosity for 1 nonsense
and 4 missense mutations in 3 of the patients (603506.0025 and
603506.0029-603506.0032). In the fourth patient, they identified only
heterozygosity for a splice site mutation (603506.0033) by sequencing;
however, using custom-designed oligonucleotide tiling array CGH targeted
to a 600-kb genomic region harboring LRP5, Narumi et al. (2010)
identified a 7.2-kb microdeletion within the LRP5 gene (603506.0034) on
the patient's second allele.

- Association with Bone Density Variation

Little et al. (2002) identified a gly171-to-val mutation in the LRP5
gene (G171V; 603506.0013) that results in an autosomal dominant high
bone mass trait (see 601884). Boyden et al. (2002) found the same LRP5
mutation in a family with autosomal dominant high bone density
associated with square jaw and torus palatinus.

Van Wesenbeeck et al. (2003) performed mutation analysis of the LRP5
gene in 10 families or isolated patients with various conditions with an
increased bone density, including endosteal hyperostosis (144750), van
Buchem disease (607636), autosomal dominant osteosclerosis, and
osteopetrosis type I. Direct sequencing of the LRP5 gene revealed 19
sequence variants, 13 of which were confirmed as polymorphisms, with the
remaining 6 novel missense mutations considered likely disease causing
(see 603506.0014-603506.0018). Like the G171V mutation (G171V;
603506.0013), which causes the high bone mass phenotype, all mutations
were located in the amino-terminal part of the gene, before the first
epidermal growth factor-like domain. These results indicated that,
despite the different diagnoses that could be made, conditions with an
increased bone density affecting mainly the cortices of the long bones
and the skull are often caused by mutations in the LRP5 gene.

Ferrari et al. (2004) tested the hypothesis that polymorphisms in the
LRP5 gene contribute to bone mass determination in the general
population. In a cross-sectional study of 889 healthy whites of both
sexes, they found significant association for a missense substitution in
exon 9 with lumbar spine bone mineral content, with bone area, and with
stature. The associations were observed mainly in adult men, in whom
LRP5 polymorphisms accounted for less than 15% of the variance of the
traits. Haplotype analysis suggested that additional genetic variation
within the region may contribute to bone mass and size determination. In
a study of 1-year gain in vertebral bone mass and size in prepubertal
children, they found a significant association in males but not females.

Mizuguchi et al. (2004) performed an association study between bone
mineral density (BMD) and 9 candidate genes in 481 healthy Japanese
women. They found that only LRP5 showed a significant association with
BMD. A follow-up case-control study of 126 women with osteoporosis (see
166710) and 131 normal controls revealed a significant difference in
allelic frequency of the LRP5 2220C-T SNP (603506.0019) (p = 0.009). The
authors suggested that LRP5 is a BMD determinant and contributes to a
risk of osteoporosis.

- Association with Obesity

Guo et al. (2006) genotyped 1,873 Caucasian individuals from 405 nuclear
families for SNPs and haplotypes of the LRP5 gene and found that the
common allele A for SNP4 (dbSNP rs4988300) and the minor allele G for
SNP6 (dbSNP rs634008) were significantly associated with obesity and
body mass index (BMI). Significant associations were also observed
between the common haplotype A-G-G-G in block 2 (intron 1) with obesity,
BMI, and fat mass (p less than 0.001, p less than 0.001, and p = 0.003,
respectively). Guo et al. (2006) concluded that intronic variants of the
LRP5 gene are markedly associated with obesity.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Using a norrin-based reporter assay to analyze the effects of
FEVR-causing mutations, Qin et al. (2008) demonstrated that a nonsense
mutation in FZD4 completely abolished signaling activity, whereas
missense mutations in FZD4 and LRP5 caused a moderate level of
reduction, and a double missense mutation in both genes caused a severe
reduction in activity, correlating roughly with clinical phenotypes.
Norrin mutants, however, showed variable effects on signal transduction,
and no correlation with clinical phenotypes was observed; norrin mutants
also showed impaired cell surface binding. Qin et al. (2008) concluded
that norrin signaling is involved in FEVR pathogenesis, but suggested
the presence of an unknown parallel pathway at the level of
receptor/ligand binding as evidenced by the moderate and variable signal
reduction lacking a clear genotype/phenotype correlation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kato et al. (2002) generated mice with a targeted disruption of Lrp5 and
showed that they develop a low bone mass phenotype. In vivo and in vitro
analyses indicated that the phenotype becomes evident postnatally, and
demonstrated that it is secondary to decreased osteoblast proliferation
and function in a Cbfa1 (600211)-independent manner. The mice also
displayed persistent embryonic eye vascularization due to a failure of
macrophage-induced endothelial cell apoptosis. DNA cotransfection and
coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that Lrp5 binds directly to Wnt
proteins. RT-PCR experiments showed that expression of proteins in the
Wnt signaling pathway was affected by Lrp5 disruption. The phenotype of
the Lrp5-deficient mice phenotype mirrored human
osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome.

Clement-Lacroix et al. (2005) found that lithium restored bone
metabolism and bone mass to near wildtype levels in Lrp5 -/- mice.
Lithium activated canonical Wnt signaling in cultured calvarial
osteoblasts from Lrp5 -/- mice, and lithium-treated mice had increased
expression of Wnt-responsive genes in their bone marrow cells in vivo.
Clement-Lacroix et al. (2005) concluded that lithium enhances bone
anabolism, at least in part, by activating the Wnt signaling pathway
downstream of LRP5.

LRP5 plays an essential role in bone accrual and eye development. Fujino
et al. (2003) showed that LRP5 is also required for normal cholesterol
and glucose metabolism. Mice lacking Lrp5 showed increased plasma
cholesterol levels when fed a high-fat diet, because of the decreased
hepatic clearance of chylomicron remnants. In addition, when fed a
normal diet, Lrp5-deficient mice showed a markedly impaired glucose
tolerance. The experiments suggested that Wnt/LRP5 signaling contributes
to the glucose-induced insulin secretion in islets.

To study lipoprotein metabolism, Magoori et al. (2003) generated mice
lacking both apolipoprotein E (apoE; 107741) and Lrp5. On a normal diet,
the double knockout mice older than 4 months of age had 60% higher
plasma cholesterol levels than the levels observed with apoE deficiency
alone. LRP5 deficiency alone had no significant effects on the plasma
cholesterol levels. Analysis showed that the very low density
lipoprotein (VLDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) fractions were
markedly increased in the double knockout mice. Atherosclerotic lesions
in the double knockout mice at age 6 months were severe, with
destruction of the internal elastic lamina.

Yadav et al. (2008) identified Tph1 (191060), which encodes the
rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin synthesis, as the most highly
overexpressed gene in Lrp5 -/- mice. Tph1 expression was also elevated
in Lrp5 -/- duodenal cells, its primary site of expression. Decreasing
serotonin blood levels normalized bone formation and bone mass in Lrp5
-/- mice, and gut-specific Lrp5 inactivation decreased bone formation in
a beta-catenin-independent manner. Moreover, gut-specific activation of
Lrp5 or inactivation of Tph1 increased bone mass and prevented
ovariectomy-induced bone loss in mice. Yadav et al. (2008) showed that
serotonin determined the extent of bone formation by binding its
receptor, Htr1b (182131), on osteoblasts and limiting osteoblast
proliferation by inhibiting Creb (see 123810)-mediated cyclin D1 (CCND1;
168461) expression. Yadav et al. (2008) concluded that LRP5 inhibits
bone formation by inhibiting serotonin production.

Cui et al. (2011) generated mice with osteocyte-specific expression of
inducible Lrp5 mutations that cause high bone mass (G171V, 603506.0013;
A214V, 603506.0017) and observed increased bone mass, bone strength, and
bone formation rates in the mutant mice compared to wildtype. Similar
studies with a truncating Lrp5 mutation resulted in reduced bone mass in
the mutant mice compared to wildtype; inactivation of Lrp5 in the
intestine, however, had no significant effect on bone mass. In addition,
induction of an Lrp5 mutation in cells that form the appendicular
skeleton but not in cells that form the axial skeleton resulted in
alterations in bone properties of the limbs but not the spine. Cui et
al. (2011) concluded that their findings supported a mechanism in mice
in which Lrp5 functions via the canonical Wnt pathway in osteocytes to
regulate bone mass rather than regulating bone mass indirectly via other
tissues.

.0013
HIGH BONE MASS
LRP5, GLY171VAL

In a family with high bone mass (see 601884), Little et al. (2002)
identified a heterozygous G-to-T transversion in exon 3 of the LRP5
gene, resulting in a gly171-to-val change in a predicted beta-propeller
module of the LRP5 protein. This change was not found in the DNA from
275 individuals with normal bone mineral density or from 643 randomly
chosen, ethnically diverse individuals.

Boyden et al. (2002) found the same mutation in affected members of a
kindred with high bone density, wide and deep mandible, and torus
palatinus. Affected members of this family had normal serum calcium and
phosphate levels, normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone and vitamin
D metabolites, and normal serum levels of acid phosphatase. Serum
osteocalcin, a marker of bone formation, was markedly elevated. Affected
members of the family had no cranial nerve pulses. They were
asymptomatic but noted difficulty staying afloat while swimming.

.0014
OSTEOPETROSIS, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 1
LRP5, GLY171ARG

Van Wesenbeeck et al. (2003) found a 511G-C transversion in exon 3 of
the LRP5 gene, causing a gly171-to-arg (G171R) mutation, in a previously
described Belgian family in which at least 3 members were diagnosed with
autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type I (OPTA1; 607634). The father
suffered from severe headaches and x-rays showed very dense bones of the
skull. His daughter had a very dense cranial base and cortical
thickening of the vertebrae and long bones with normal development. His
son had dense bones, mainly of the skull. The codon involved in this
mutation is the same as that in the gain-of-function gly171-to-val
mutation (G171V; 603506.0013) described in 2 other families by Little et
al. (2002) and Boyden et al. (2002). The phenotype was different in
those 2 families; the family described by Little et al. (2002) had no
features other than very dense bones, whereas patients in the other
kindred also suffered from a wide, deep mandible and torus palatinus.
The clinical and radiologic features of the Belgian family resembled
those of the family described by Little et al. (2002), as they did not
suffer from an enlarged mandible or torus palatinus.

.0015
ENDOSTEAL HYPEROSTOSIS, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
OSTEOPETROSIS, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 1, INCLUDED;;
VAN BUCHEM DISEASE, TYPE 2, INCLUDED
LRP5, ALA242THR

Van Wesenbeeck et al. (2003) described a 724G-A transition in exon 4 of
the LRP5 gene, resulting in an ala242-to-thr (A242T) mutation, in 2
previously described families from Portland, Oregon, in which members
were affected with autosomal dominant endosteal hyperostosis (144750).
The condition is characterized by cortical thickening of the long bones,
with no alteration in external shape, and a remarkable resistance of the
bone to fracture. The skeleton was normal in childhood; the affected
patients had a normal height, proportion, intelligence, and longevity.
Facial metamorphoses occurred in adolescence, as the forehead flattened,
the mandible became elongated, and the gonial angle decreased. Torus
palatinus developed in the hard palate, which could lead to malocclusion
or loss of teeth. The clinical and radiographic features closely
resembled those of the kindred described by Boyden et al. (2002), in
whom a gly171-to-val mutation (G171V; 603506.0013) was identified. This
A242T mutation was also present in a previously described Sardinian
family with at least 5 members affected with van Buchem disease
(607636), all of whom had osteosclerosis of the skull and enlarged
mandible. The autosomal dominant inheritance in this family was clearly
in contrast with the diagnosis of autosomal recessive van Buchem disease
(239100) that had been made by Scopelliti et al. (1999). This mutation
was also present in a French family in which an affected proband and his
brother had autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type I (607634),
osteomyelitis of the jaw, and hearing problems because of small auditory
canals. X-rays showed diffuse osteosclerosis of the trabecular and
cortical bone and osteosclerosis of the skull with enlargement of the
cranial vault.

ENDOSTEAL HYPEROSTOSIS, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
LRP5, ALA214THR

In a kindred with autosomal dominant endosteal hyperostosis (144750),
Van Wesenbeeck et al. (2003) found a 640G-A transition in exon 3 of the
LRP5 gene, resulting in an ala214-to-thr (A214T) mutation. This mutation
was in the same codon, but involved a different nucleotide, as one the
authors described in another family with a different phenotype (see
603506.0017).

.0017
OSTEOSCLEROSIS, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
LRP5, ALA214VAL

Van Wesenbeeck et al. (2003) identified a 641C-T transition in exon 3 of
the LRP5 gene, resulting in an ala214-to-val (A214V) mutation, in a
previously described family of English origin with autosomal dominant
osteosclerosis (144750) manifest by an enlarged mandible (present in the
20-year-old proband and her father), increased gonial angle, and
thickened cortical bone. In the father, there were no other clinical
signs and the radiographic appearance of the skull was within normal
limits.

.0018
OSTEOPETROSIS, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 1
LRP5, THR253ILE

Van Wesenbeeck et al. (2003) identified a 758C-T transition in exon 4 of
the LRP5 gene, resulting in a thr253-to-ile (T253I) change, in 2
previously described and presumably unrelated Danish families diagnosed
with autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type I (607634). In both families,
affected members showed generalized osteosclerosis, most pronounced in
the cranial vault, not associated with an increased fracture rate.

.0019
BONE MINERAL DENSITY QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCUS 1
LRP5, 2220C-T

In adult Japanese women, Mizuguchi et al. (2004) found an association
between the T allele of the 2220C-T polymorphism in exon 10 of the LRP5
gene and low bone mineral density (BMND1; 601884). A case-control study
of 126 women with osteoporosis (see 166710) and 131 normal controls
revealed a significant difference in allelic frequency of the 2220C-T
SNP (p = 0.009). The authors suggested that LRP5 is a BMD determinant
and contributes to a risk of osteoporosis.

LRP5, IVS21DS, T-G, +2

In affected members of a family with autosomal dominant exudative
vitreoretinopathy (EVR4; 601813) reported by Price et al. (1996), Toomes
et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous substitution of the second
nucleotide of intron 21 of the LRP5 gene, changing the GT splice donor
site to GG (4488+2T-G). The mutation was predicted to lead to deletion
of exon 21, resulting in a frameshift at codon 1449 with a premature
stop codon following 52 incorrect amino acids.

.0021

LRP5, 1-BP INS, 4119C

In affected members of an American family with autosomal dominant
exudative vitreoretinopathy (EVR4; 601813), Toomes et al. (2004)
identified a heterozygous 1-bp insertion in exon 20 of the LRP5 gene,
4119insC, resulting in a frameshift at codon 1374 with a premature stop
codon following 175 incorrect amino acids. Two asymptomatic members
carried the mutation but had not been examined by fluorescein
angiography to exclude a very mild phenotype.

EXUDATIVE VITREORETINOPATHY 4, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
LRP5, ARG570GLN

In a family reported by de Crecchio et al. (1998), Jiao et al. (2004)
found that sisters with exudative vitreoretinopathy (EVR4; 601813)
carried a homozygous 1757G-A transition in 8 of the LRP5 gene, resulting
in an arg570-to-gln (R570Q) amino acid substitution. The sisters were
diagnosed at ages 5 years and 7 years and had shown typical signs of
FEVR. They required multiple procedures including photocoagulation,
cryopexy, and vitrectomy. They showed no signs of systemic disease,
including fractures, at ages 29 years and 31 years.

.0023
EXUDATIVE VITREORETINOPATHY 4, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
LRP5, ARG752GLY

In affected members of a family with autosomal recessive exudative
vitreoretinopathy (EVR4; 601813) reported by Shastry and Trese (1997),
Jiao et al. (2004) identified a homozygous 2302C-G transversion in exon
10 of the LRP5 gene, resulting in an arg752-to-gly (R752G) amino acid
change in the third YWTD domain of the protein. Two affected sisters
also had an affected paternal uncle; these 3 affected individuals were
the offspring of consanguineous marriages. Both sisters were diagnosed
at 3 years of age, at which time they manifested typical signs of FEVR,
including large retinal folds, peripheral traction and exudates, and an
avascular demarcation line near the equator and vitreous detachments.

.0024

In a brother and sister with familial exudative retinopathy (EVR4;
601813) reported by de Crecchio et al. (1998), Jiao et al. (2004) found
a homozygous 414G-A transition in exon 19 of the LRP5 gene, resulting in
a glu1367-to-lys (E1367K) amino acid change. The brother and sister were
diagnosed with retinal detachments at ages 6 years and 8 years,
respectively, and also showed other typical signs of FEVR. They showed
no systemic symptoms, such as fractures or traumatic injuries, by ages
12 years and 10 years, respectively. No additional family members were
known to be affected.

.0025
EXUDATIVE VITREORETINOPATHY 4, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
OSTEOPOROSIS-PSEUDOGLIOMA SYNDROME, INCLUDED
LRP5, LEU145PHE

In 3 Japanese sibs with EVR4 (601813), Qin et al. (2005) identified a
heterozygous 433C-T transition in exon 2 of the LRP5 gene, resulting in
a leu145-to-phe (L145F) substitution in a conserved residue in the
beta-propeller structure of the protein. The mother, who also carried
the mutation, had mild retinal avascularization and significantly
decreased bone mineral density (z score of -2.5).

In a 23-year-old Japanese man with pseudoglioma and multiple fractures
due to osteopenia (OPPG; 259770), Narumi et al. (2010) identified
compound heterozygosity for the L145F mutation and a 1655T-C transition
in the LRP5 gene, resulting in a thr552-to-met (T552M; 603506.0029)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the second YWTD-EGF-like
domain. The patient, who had normal intelligence, had microphthalmia and
retinal detachment in the left eye and persistent hyperplasia of the
primary vitreous in the right eye. Radiography revealed osteopenia,
kyphoscoliosis, and platyspondyly in all vertebrae; he became
wheelchair-dependent at 11 years of age due to multiple compression
fractures. His unaffected mother was heterozygous for L145F; DNA was
unavailable from his father. Neither mutation was found in 100 controls.

.0026
EXUDATIVE VITREORETINOPATHY 4, DIGENIC
LRP5, ARG444CYS

In affected members of a Japanese family with EVR4 (601813), Qin et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 1330C-T transition in exon 6 of the
LRP5 gene, resulting in an arg444-to-cys (R444C) substitution in a
conserved residue in the beta-propeller structure of the protein.
Affected members of this family also had a heterozygous mutation in the
FZD4 gene (R417Q; 604579.0003; Kondo et al., 2003). The 2 mutations
cosegregated in the family, indicating that both mutations were located
on the same chromosomes consistent with digenic inheritance. The ocular
phenotype in this family tended to be more severe compared to that seen
in a family with the FZD4 R417Q mutation alone (Kondo et al., 2003). In
addition, the proband in the family with both mutations had reduced bone
mass (z score of -2.1), whereas the proband carrying the FZD4 mutation
alone had a normal bone mineral density. Qin et al. (2005) concluded
that the 2 mutations showed a synergistic deleterious effect in this
family.

EXUDATIVE VITREORETINOPATHY 4, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
LRP5, GLY610ARG

In a Japanese girl with EVR4 (601813), Qin et al. (2005) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the LRP5 gene: a 1828G-A
transition in exon 9, resulting in a gly610-to-arg (G610R) substitution,
and a 10-bp deletion (del803-812; 603506.0028) in exon 4. Each parent
was heterozygous for 1 of the mutations. Although neither parent had the
ocular phenotype, both showed decreased bone mineral densities.

In an 18-year-old Japanese male and a 10-year-old Japanese boy with
osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome (OPPG; 259770), Narumi et al. (2010)
identified compound heterozygosity for a 1145C-T transition in the LRP5
gene, resulting in a pro382-to-leu (P382L) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in the second YWTD-EGF-like domain, and another LRP5
mutation. The 18-year-old also carried a 731C-T transition, resulting in
a thr244-to-met (T244M; 603506.0031) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in the first YWTD-EGF-like domain; the 10-year-old carried a
4600C-T transition, resulting in an arg1534-to-ter (R1534X; 603506.0032)
substitution in the cytoplasmic domain. In both families, the unaffected
parents were each heterozygous for 1 of the mutations, none of which was
found in 100 controls. In addition to their eye and bone findings, both
patients had moderate mental retardation. Narumi et al. (2010) noted
that the T244M and R1534X mutations had previously been reported in OPPG
patients by Ai et al. (2005) and Gong et al. (2001), respectively.

for a splice site transition (1584+1G-A) in intron 7 and a 7.2-kb
microdeletion encompassing exons 22 and 23 (603506.0034) of the LRP5
gene. The unaffected parents were each heterozygous for 1 of the
mutations, neither of which was found in 100 controls. Sequencing of a
mutant RT-PCR fragment indicated that the splice site mutation caused
cryptic splice donor site utilization 63-bp downstream of the native
exon/intron junction, predicted to add an extra 21 amino acids without a
termination codon after glu528 (E528_V529ins21). The 7.2-kb
microdeletion was discovered using custom-designed oligonucleotide
tiling array CGH targeted to a 600-kb genomic region harboring LRP5;
Narumi et al. (2010) stated that this was one of the smallest deletions
identified by aCGH-based analyses.

615203	TITLE *615203 RHOMBOID DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; RHBDD2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RHBDD2 is a distantly related member of the rhomboid family of
membrane-bound proteases that catalyze regulated intramembrane
proteolysis (Ahmedli et al., 2013).

CLONING

Using database analysis to identify rhomboid-like genes that were
overexpressed in breast cancers, Abba et al. (2009) identified
full-length RHBDD2 and a splice variant lacking exon 2. Western blot
analysis revealed that full-length RHBDD2 had an apparent molecular mass
of 47 kD, whereas the smaller isoform had an apparent molecular mass of
40 kD.

Independently, Ahmedli et al. (2013) identified full-length human
RHBDD2, which encodes a 364-amino acid protein. They also identified 2
variants that, compared with full-length RHBDD2, include insertions in
intron 1, and both encode a 223-amino acid protein. RHBDD2 was predicted
to have either 5 or 7 transmembrane helices and a potential glycine
zipper motif. Northern blot analysis detected a major transcript of
about 2.0 kb in all mouse tissues examined, with highest expression in
brain, kidney, testis, and ovary, and weaker expression in heart, liver,
spleen, embryo, and lung. Transcripts of 4.0 and 2.5 kb were also
detected in all tissues examined. All 3 transcripts were detected in
mouse retina. Quantitative RT-PCR of developing mouse retina revealed
low Rhbdd2 expression at postnatal day 1, with expression increasing to
a maximum at postnatal day 14, and decreasing to postnatal day 30. In
transfected HEK293 cells, mouse Rhbdd2 localized predominantly to the
cis-Golgi. Rhbdd2 retained its association with the Golgi marker Gm130
(GOLGA2; 602580) during the cell cycle and following disruption of the
Golgi with brefeldin A. Rhbdd2 also colocalized with Gm130 in the inner
segment of photoreceptor cells and in the perinuclear region of ganglion
cells in mouse retina.

GENE FUNCTION

Abba et al. (2009) found that expression of RHBDD2 was upregulated in
primary tumors from patients with recurrent breast cancer and in
advanced stage III breast carcinomas. RHBDD2 expression was linked to
shortened metastasis-free interval and relapse-free survival, but only
in patients with cancers negative for estrogen receptor-alpha (ESR1;
133430). Amplification at the RHBDD2 locus was detected in 21% of 98
invasive breast carcinomas and in MCF7 and T47D breast carcinoma cell
lines. Knockdown of RHBDD2 in MCF7 cells via small interfering RNA
reduced proliferation, but it did not affect cell viability or
morphology.

Ahmedli et al. (2013) found that disruption of the glycine zipper motif
in mouse Rhbdd2 disrupted its Golgi localization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Abba et al. (2009) determined that the RHBDD2 gene contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Abba et al. (2009) mapped the RHBDD2 gene
to chromosome 7q11.23.

602677	TITLE *602677 RING FINGER PROTEIN 5; RNF5
;;RING5;;
RMA1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The RING finger is a unique zinc-chelating domain involved in mediating
protein-protein interactions. The extensive sequence homology within the
RING finger domain permitted Kyushiki et al. (1997) to clone RNF5, a
novel member of the RING finger family of genes. RNF5 encodes a
predicted 1,620-amino acid protein that shares significant homology with
a hypothetical protein encoded by Caenorhabditis elegans. Expression of
RNF5 was detected as a 1.2-kb transcript in a variety of human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Cystic fibrosis (219700) arises from misfolding and premature
degradation of CFTR (602421) containing a deletion of phe508 (delF508;
602421.0001). Younger et al. (2006) identified an endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) membrane-associated ubiquitin ligase complex containing the E3
RMA1, the E2 UBC6E (UBE2J1), and derlin-1 (DERL1; 608813) that
cooperated with the cytosolic HSC70 (HSPA8; 600816)/CHIP (STUB1; 607207)
E3 complex to triage CFTR and delFl508. Derlin-1 retained CFTR in the ER
membrane and interacted with RMA1 and UBC6E to promote proteasomal
degradation of CFTR. RMA1 could recognize folding defects in delF508
coincident with translation, whereas CHIP appeared to act
posttranslationally. A folding defect in delF508 detected by RMA1
involved the inability of the second membrane-spanning domain of CFTR to
productively interact with N-terminal domains. Younger et al. (2006)
concluded that the RMA1 and CHIP E3 ubiquitin ligases act sequentially
in ER membrane and cytosol to monitor the folding status of CFTR and
delF508.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Zhong et al. (2009) identified RNF5 as an
MITA (TMEM173; 612374)-interacting protein. Coimmunoprecipitation and
mutation analyses showed that the RNF5 C terminus was required for the
interaction, which was induced by viral infection. RNF5 ubiquitinated
MITA at lys150, leading to MITA degradation and inhibition of
virus-induced IRF3 (603734) activation, IFNB1 (147640) expression, and
cellular antiviral response. Zhong et al. (2009) concluded that RNF5
negatively regulates virus-induced signaling by targeting MITA for
ubiquitination and degradation at the mitochondria.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kyushiki et al. (1997) determined that the RNF5 gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

Kyushiki et al. (1997) mapped the RNF5 gene to chromosome 6p21.31 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Radiation hybrid mapping likewise
assigned RNF5 to a region proximal to the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p. RNF5 was the third RING finger gene
identified in the region proximal to MHC, raising the possibility that
this family of genes may exist as a cluster in that area of the genome.
The others are RING finger protein-1 (602045) and RING finger protein-3
(601540).

608729	TITLE *608729 ANGIOTENSIN II RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; AGTRAP
;;ATRAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the C-terminal domain of murine At2r1a (106165) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen, Daviet et al. (1999) cloned mouse Agtrap from a kidney
cDNA library. The deduced 161-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 17.8 kD. It contains several extensive N-terminal
hydrophobic domains, as well as potential sites for phosphorylation and
N-glycosylation. Northern blot analysis detected transcripts of 1.2 and
0.8 kb in all mouse tissues examined, with relatively high levels in
kidney, testis, and heart. PCR also detected Agtrap expression in mouse
aortic tissue and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).

By sequencing clones obtained from a fetal brain cDNA library, followed
by EST database analysis, Wang et al. (2002) cloned human AGTRAP. The
deduced 159-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 17.3
kD. AGTRAP has a 21-amino acid N-terminal transmembrane region that is
followed by a conserved cysteine, which is potentially palmitoylated.
Mouse and human AGTRAP share 74% amino acid homology. Northern blot
analysis detected a 1.2-kb transcript in almost all tissues examined,
with highest abundance in kidney, heart, pancreas, and thyroid.

GENE FUNCTION

By affinity chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Daviet
et al. (1999) confirmed association between mouse Agtrap and At2r1a.
Agtrap interacted specifically with the C-terminal domain of At2r1a, but
not with the C-terminal domains of several other hormone receptors,
including AT2R2 (300034), CHRM3 (118494), BDKRB2 (113503), EDNRB
(131244), and ADRB2 (109690). Overexpression of Agtrap in COS-7 cells
inhibited At2r1a activation of phospholipase C (see 607120). It did not
affect Chrm3 activation.

Cui et al. (2000) determined that transfection of mouse Agtrap into
adult rat VSMCs potentiated At2r1 internalization upon angiotensin II
(see 106150) stimulation. Receptor-induced DNA synthesis was inhibited
in Agtrap-transfected VSMCs, and this was associated with inhibition of
Stat3 (102582) and Akt (see 164730) phosphorylation. Cui et al. (2000)
concluded that AGTRAP is a negative regulator of AT2R1-mediated cell
proliferation in VSMCs.

Using several assays of protein interaction, Wang et al. (2002) showed
that AGTRAP interacted with RACK1 (176981). They suggested that the
AGTRAP-RACK1 interaction may help recruit the signaling complex to AT2R1
and affect receptor signaling.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Guo et al. (2005) demonstrated that mouse
Caml (CAMLG; 601118) interacted with Atrap. The N-terminal hydrophilic
domain of Caml mediated the interaction, and the proteins colocalized in
the endoplasmic reticulum. Atrap knockdown increased NFAT (see NFATC2;
600490) activity, and overexpression of Atrap decreased angiotensin II-
or Caml-induced NFAT transcriptional activation. Overexpression of the
N-terminal ATRAP-interacting domain of Caml increased angiotensin
II-induced NFAT promoter activity, whereas overexpression of the
C-terminal end of Caml disrupted the effect of angiotensin II on NFAT
signaling.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the AGTRAP
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SHGC-32094).

604661	TITLE *604661 POTASSIUM CHANNEL-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2; KCNIP2
;;KCHIP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the brain and heart, rapidly inactivating (A-type) voltage-gated
potassium (Kv) currents operate at subthreshold membrane potentials to
control the excitability of neurons and cardiac myocytes. An et al.
(2000) described 3 Kv channel-interacting proteins called KCHIPs that
bind to the cytoplasmic amino termini of Kv4-alpha subunits. See KCHIP1
(604660). The KCHIP2 cDNA encodes a 252-amino acid protein that has a
distinct amino terminus but shares approximately 70% amino acid identity
with KCHIP1 and KCHIP3 throughout a carboxy-terminal 185-amino acid core
domain containing 4 EF-hand-like motifs. Expression of KCHIP2 and Kv4
together reconstituted several features of native A-type currents by
modulating the density, inactivation kinetics, and rate of recovery from
inactivation of Kv4 channels in heterologous cells. The KCHIPs
colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with brain Kv4-alpha subunits and
are thus integral components of native Kv4 channel complexes.

GENE FUNCTION

Jeyaraj et al. (2012) provided molecular evidence that links circadian
rhythms to vulnerability in ventricular arrhythmias in mice.
Specifically, they showed that cardiac ion channel expression and QT
interval duration (an index of myocardial repolarization) exhibit
endogenous circadian rhythmicity under the control of a clock-dependent
oscillator, Kruppel-like factor-15 (KLF15; 606465). Klf15
transcriptionally controls rhythmic expression of KChIP2, a critical
subunit required for generating the transient outward potassium current.
Deficiency or excess of Klf15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation,
abnormal repolarization, and enhanced susceptibility to ventricular
arrhythmias. Jeyaraj et al. (2012) concluded that their findings
identified circadian transcription of ion channels as a mechanism for
cardiac arrhythmogenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kuo et al. (2001) found that knockout mice deficient for Kchip2
exhibited normal cardiac structure and function but displayed a
prolonged elevation in the ST segment on the electrocardiogram. The
Kchip2 -/- mice were highly susceptible to the induction of cardiac
arrhythmias. Single-cell analysis revealed a substrate for
arrhythmogenesis, including a complete absence of transient outward
potassium current (I-to) and a marked increase in action potential
duration. These studies demonstrated that a defect in KCHIP2 is
sufficient to confer a marked genetic susceptibility to arrhythmias,
establishing a novel genetic pathway for ventricular tachycardia via a
loss of the transmural gradient of I-to.

147850	TITLE *147850 INTERLEUKIN 5; IL5
;;EOSINOPHIL DIFFERENTIATION FACTOR; EDF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Campbell et al. (1987) cloned eosinophil differentiation factor (EDF)
from a genomic library in lambda phage by using a murine EDF cDNA clone
as a probe. The predicted amino acid sequence of 134 amino acids was
identical to that reported for human interleukin-5 but showed no
significant homology with other known hematopoietic growth regulators.
Interleukin-5 is a selective eosinophil-activating growth hormone. The
amino acid sequence was about 70% identical to that of murine EDF.
Recombinant human EDF, expressed from the human EDF gene after
transfection into monkey COS cells, stimulated the production of
eosinophils and eosinophil colonies from normal human bone marrow but
had no effect on the production of neutrophils or mononuclear cells
(monocytes and lymphoid cells).

Tanabe et al. (1987) cloned the IL5 gene and determined its structure.

Yokota et al. (1987) concluded that a single cDNA clone encodes a
protein that acts as a growth and differentiation factor for both B
cells and eosinophils.

GENE STRUCTURE

Campbell et al. (1987) found that the human IL5 gene contains 3 introns.

MAPPING

Takahashi et al. (1989) mapped the IL5 gene to 5q23.3-q31.1 by in situ
hybridization. Sutherland et al. (1988) assigned the gene to 5q31 by in
situ hybridization and showed that the gene is deleted in the 5q-
syndrome. At least 3 other genes involved in hematopoiesis are located
in the same region: IL3 (147740), GMCSF (138960), and FMS (164770).
Chandrasekharappa et al. (1990) demonstrated that IL4 and IL5 are
closely linked physically, with a maximum separation of 310 kb. There
appeared to be an HTF island between them. IL3 and CSF2 (138960), which
are located in the same general area of 5q, could not physically be
linked to IL4 or IL5. Willman et al. (1993), who mapped IRF1 (147575) to
5q31.1, concluded that the order of genes is:
cen--IL4--IL5--IRF1--CDC25C--IL3/CSF2--tel. Kozak (1988) assigned the
homologous mouse locus to chromosome 11 by in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Coffman et al. (1989) showed that a monoclonal antibody to IL5
completely suppressed the blood eosinophilia in mice parasitized by a
nematode but had no effect on serum IgE increase in response to the
infestation. In contrast, an antibody to interleukin-4 (147780)
inhibited parasite-induced IgE but not the eosinophilia.

In a patient with the hypereosinophilia syndrome (see 131400), Cogan et
al. (1994) demonstrated clonal proliferation of type-2 helper T cells
and showed that production of large amounts of IL5 was responsible for
eosinophilia, and interleukin-4 for excessive production of IgE.

Studying 30 asthmatic and 30 nonasthmatic subjects, Pereira et al.
(1998) found no changes from the normal sequence in all 4 exons of IL5,
as well as the promoter and 3-prime untranslated regions, by SSCP and
heteroduplex analysis. They concluded that mutations in the IL5 gene are
not likely to be a common cause of inherited predisposition to asthma.

Simon et al. (1999) found that clonal populations of abnormal T cells
producing interleukin-5 occur in some patients with idiopathic
eosinophilia. Among 60 patients with idiopathic eosinophilia, 16 had
circulating T cells with an aberrant immunophenotype. In each of these
patients, the abnormal immunophenotype was unique. Evidence of clonal
rearrangements of the T-cell receptor was obtained in 8 of the 16
patients. The aberrant T cells produced large amounts of interleukin-5
in vitro. At the time of the initial blood analysis, 15 of the 16
patients had no evidence of a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder.

Broide et al. (1999) reviewed the genes that regulate eosinophilic
inflammation, including IL5.

Long-range regulatory elements are difficult to discover experimentally;
however, they tend to be conserved among mammals, suggesting that
cross-species sequence comparisons should identify them. To search for
regulatory sequences, Loots et al. (2000) examined about 1 megabase of
orthologous human and mouse sequences for conserved noncoding elements
with greater than or equal to 70% identity over at least 100 basepairs.
Ninety noncoding sequences meeting these criteria were discovered, and
the analysis of 15 of these elements found that about 70% were conserved
across mammals. Characterization of the largest element in transgenic
mice propagating human 5q31 yeast artificial chromosomes revealed it to
be a coordinate regulator of 3 genes, interleukin-4, interleukin-13
(147683), and interleukin-5. This conserved noncoding sequence, called
CNS1 by Loots et al. (2000), is 401 bp in length and is located in the
intergenic region, approximately 13 kb, between IL4 and IL13. CNS1
demonstrates a high degree of conservation across mammals (80% identity
in mice, humans, cows, dogs, and rabbits), which contrasts sharply with
the relatively low conservation observed in the coding regions of the
flanking genes, IL4 and IL13, which have only 50% identity between
humans and mice. This element is single copy in the human genome and has
been conserved during evolution, not only with regards to sequence but
also to genomic location, having been mapped in dogs, baboons, humans,
and mice to the IL4-IL13 intergenic region. Experiments in transgenic
mice revealed that CNS1 acts through its effect on the transcriptional
activity of IL4, IL13, and IL5. Expression of other genes in the YAC had
no change relative to wildtype in activated Th2 cells or other tissues
tested.

By analysis of human YAC transgenic mice containing the 5q31 cytokine
genes, Lacy et al. (2000) determined that the human proteins are
produced under Th2 conditions in vitro and in response to
Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, a Th2-inducing stimulus, in vivo. The
authors observed no adverse effects on murine lymphoid organs. Fewer
cells produced the endogenous mouse cytokines in transgenic than in
control mice, suggesting competition for stable expression between the
mouse and human genes. The data also suggested that regulatory elements
within the human transgene are capable of interacting with trans-acting
murine factors.

Normal intestinal mucosa contains abundant immunoglobulin A
(IgA)-secreting cells, which are generated from B cells in
gut-associated lymphoid tissues. Mora et al. (2006) showed that
dendritic cells (DCs) from gut-associated lymphoid tissues induce T
cell-independent expression of IgA and gut-homing receptors on B cells.
Gut-associated lymphoid tissue DC-derived retinoic acid alone conferred
gut tropism but could not promote IgA secretion. However, retinoic acid
potently synergized with the gut-associated lymphoid tissue DC-derived
IL6 (147620) or IL5 to induce IgA secretion. Mora et al. (2006) found
that consequently, mice deficient in the retinoic acid precursor vitamin
A lacked IgA-secreting cells in the small intestine. Mora et al. (2006)
found that gut-associated lymphoid tissue DCs shape mucosal immunity by
modulating B cell migration and effector activity through
synergistically acting mediators.

Endo et al. (2011) examined expression of cell surface markers to
identify functionally distinct subpopulations of mouse Th2 cells. FACS
analysis demonstrated 4 Th2 subpopulations based on high or low
expression levels of Cd62l (SELL; 153240) and Cxcr3 (300574). All 4
subpopulations produced comparable levels of Il4 and Il13, but Th2 cells
expressing low levels of both Cd62l and Cxcr3 (Cd62l-lo/Cxcr3-lo cells)
selectively produced Il5. Il5 production in Cd62l-lo/Cxcr3-lo cells was
accompanied by histone H3-K4 methylation, a marker for the permissive
conformation of chromatin, at the IL5 promoter. DNA microarray analysis
and quantitative RT-PCR showed that Cd44 (107269)-positive memory Th2
cells expressing Il5 had lower levels of Eomes (604615) and Tbx21
(604895) and higher levels of Rora (600825) and Pparg (601487) than
memory Th2 cells lacking Il5 expression. RNA silencing demonstrated that
Eomes downregulation was required for Il5 expression and that Eomes had
no effect on H3-K4 methylation at the Il5 promoter. Instead Eomes
suppressed Gata3 (131320) transcriptional activity by inhibiting Gata3
binding to the Il5 promoter. Depletion of Cd62l-lo/Cxcr3-lo cells
ameliorated memory Th2 cell-dependent airway inflammation in mice. Endo
et al. (2011) concluded that IL5 production preferentially occurs in the
CD62L-lo/CXCR3-lo subpopulation regulated by EOMES expression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Rodrigues et al. (1996) noted that, as the main regulator of
eosinopoiesis, eosinophil maturation and activation, and IgA production,
IL5 contributes in several ways to human immune defenses against various
pathogens, including helminths and infectious agents of the digestive
and respiratory tracts. On the other hand, the increase in number of
eosinophils and the activation of these cells, both of which are related
to elevated IL5 production, are the cause of severe pathologic
disorders, as in asthma or hypereosinophilic syndromes. To investigate
the role of genetic factors in the large variability observed in IL5
production among subjects exposed to comparable antigenic stimulation,
Rodrigues et al. (1996) conducted a segregation analysis in a Brazilian
population infected by the helminth parasite Schistosoma mansoni. The
analysis was performed on IL5 levels produced by blood mononuclear cells
of these subjects after in vitro restimulation with either parasite
extracts (designated IL5/SS for schistosomula sonicates) or the
T-lymphocyte mitogen phytohemagglutinin (designated the IL5/PHA
phenotype). The results provided evidence to Rodrigues et al. (1996) for
the segregation of a codominant major gene controlling IL5/SS and
IL5/PHA production and accounting for 70% and 73% of the phenotypic
variance, respectively; the frequency of the allele predisposing to low
IL5 production was approximately 0.22 for both phenotypes. They found no
significant relationship between these genes and the gene controlling
infection intensities by S. mansoni detected in a previous study. The
authors could not ascertain whether the IL5/SS and IL5/PHA phenotypes
were determined by a single gene locus.

The SM1 locus (181460) on chromosome 5q31-q33 is associated with
intensity of infection with the African Schistosoma (blood fluke)
species, S. mansoni. Ellis et al. (2007) genotyped 30 HapMap tagging
SNPs in a nested case control study across 3 genes in the 5q31-q33
region, IL4, IL5, and IL13, in 159 individuals putatively susceptible to
reinfection with the Asian Schistosoma species, S. japonicum, 133
putatively resistant individuals, and 113 individuals with symptomatic
infection. They identified 2 strongly linked SNPs in the 3-prime UTR of
IL5, dbSNP rs4143832 and dbSNP rs17690122, that were associated with
susceptibility to symptomatic infection. Ellis et al. (2007) concluded
that variants in the 3-prime UTR of IL5 may modulate the immune response
in individuals with symptomatic infection.

ALLP17
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By proteomic analysis of human sperm 2D gels, followed by RACE-PCR of
human testicular cDNA, Mandal et al. (2003) cloned SPACA3, which they
called SLLP1, and identified the mouse and rat homologs. The deduced
215-amino acid SPACA3 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 23.4
kD. SPACA3 contains a putative transmembrane region followed by a
predicted protease cleavage site between an ala-lys linkage, a signature
sequence for the alpha-lactalbumin (149750)/lysozyme C (LYZ; 153450)
protein family, 3 predicted N-terminal and 1 C-terminal myristoylation
sites, and 2 phosphorylation sites. SPACA3 shares 53% and 52% identity
with monkey stomach lysozyme and human lysozyme, respectively. Northern
blot analysis of human tissues detected a 1.0-kb transcript in testis
only. Immunofluorescent studies localized SPACA3 to the sperm head
acrosome and equatorial segment, and immunogold staining detected SPACA3
distribution over the entire acrosomal matrix, including the principal
and equatorial segments.

GENE FUNCTION

Mandal et al. (2003) found no evidence for SPACA3 bacteriolytic
activity, and SPACA3 displayed no significant effect on human sperm
binding and fusion to zona-free hamster eggs.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mandal et al. (2003) determined that the SPACA3 gene contains 5 exons
spanning about 6.0 kb.

;;DEMATIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dematin, or EPB49, is an actin-bundling protein originally identified in
the erythroid membrane skeleton. Its actin-bundling activity is
abolished upon phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and is
restored after dephosphorylation (Rana et al., 1993).

CLONING

Chishti et al. (1989) proposed the name dematin (from the Greek 'dema,'
a bundle) for an actin-bundling protein identified in the human
erythroid membrane skeleton. Rana et al. (1993) noted that dematin
consists of 2 polypeptide chains of 48 and 52 kD that were identified as
protein 4.9 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. In solution, dematin exists as a
trimer and bundles actin filaments in a phosphorylation-dependent
manner. Rana et al. (1993) cloned dematin from a human reticulocyte cDNA
library. The deduced 383-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 43 kD. Dematin has a polyglutamine motif that may constitute a
nuclear localization signal, a PEST sequence, a C-terminal domain highly
similar to the C-terminal headpiece domain of villin (VIL; 193040), and
several putative phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected
variable dematin expression in all tissues examined. Immunofluorescence
microscopy revealed punctate dematin staining around the cell nucleus in
cultured human erythroblasts.

Although dematin is an actin-bundling protein of the erythroid membrane
skeleton, it is abundantly expressed in human brain, heart, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and lung. Azim et al. (1995) reported the primary
structure of the 52-kD subunit of dematin, which differs from the 48-kD
subunit by a 22-amino acid insertion within its headpiece domain. A
unique feature of the insertion sequence of the 52-kD subunit is its
homology to erythrocyte protein 4.2 (177070).

GENE FUNCTION

Rana et al. (1993) confirmed that purified human dematin possessed
actin-bundling activity in vitro. Protease treatment and microsequencing
revealed that the C-terminal headpiece domain bound actin filaments, but
it did not have actin-bundling activity.

Azim et al. (1996) demonstrated that dematin and protein 4.2 bound ATP.

Gilligan and Bennett (1993) provided a review.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid panels and fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Azim et al. (1995) localized the dematin gene to chromosome 8p21.1, a
site distal to the locus of ankyrin (612641) at chromosome 8p11.2.

Peters et al. (1995) demonstrated that the murine dematin gene,
symbolized Epb4.9, maps to chromosome 14. They raised the possibility
that dematin mutations may be involved in neurologic abnormalities in
the mouse.

ANIMAL MODEL

By using homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells, Khanna
et al. (2002) deleted the headpiece domain of dematin to evaluate its
function in vivo. Dematin headpiece-null mice were viable and born at
the expected mendelian ratio. Hematologic evaluation showed evidence of
compensated anemia and spherocytosis in these mice, however. The
headpiece-null erythrocytes were osmotically fragile, and displayed
reduced deformability and filterability. In vitro, significantly greater
membrane fragmentation of these erythrocytes was demonstrated.
Biochemical characterization showed a weakened membrane skeleton
evidenced by reduced association of spectrin and actin to the plasma
membrane. Together, these results provided evidence for the physiologic
significance of dematin and demonstrated a role for the headpiece domain
in the maintenance of structural integrity and mechanical properties of
red cells in vivo.

Chen et al. (2007) created double-knockout mice lacking beta-adducin
(ADD2; 102681) and the headpiece domain of dematin. Double-knockout pups
were pale compared with wildtype pups, but otherwise they appeared
grossly normal. Peripheral blood analysis showed severe hemolytic anemia
with reduced number of erythrocytes/hematocrit/hemoglobin and an
approximately 12-fold increase in the number of circulating
reticulocytes. The presence of a variety of misshapen and fragmented
erythrocytes correlated with increased osmotic fragility and reduced in
vivo life span. Mutant erythrocyte membranes showed weak retention of
spectrin-actin complexes, increased grain size, decreased filament
number, and features consistent with the presence of large protein
aggregates. Chen et al. (2007) concluded that dematin and adducin are
essential for the maintenance of erythrocyte shape and membrane
stability.

SMALL INDUCIBLE CYTOKINE A1;;
INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE I-309; I309
DESCRIPTION The inflammatory cytokine I-309 is one of the small inducible
chemotactic and inflammatory peptides which have a hydrophobic leader
sequence typical of secreted proteins; in many cases the products have
indeed been demonstrated to be secreted. Comparison of amino acid
sequences of the gene products show that they share numerous conserved
amino acids, most notably 4 cysteine residues that are arranged in a
characteristic motif. The superfamily is divided into 2 subfamilies,
which are called CC or CXC, depending on whether the protein has 2
adjacent cysteine residues or has a single amino acid separating the 2
cysteine residues, respectively. Three characterized members of the CXC
family, platelet factor-4 (173460), INP10 (147310), and MGSA (155730),
have been mapped to chromosome 4, whereas members of the CC family, such
as RANTES (187011), have been mapped to chromosome 17. By study of a
panel of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids, Miller et al. (1990) mapped
the gene for I309 (SCYA1), a small secreted protein produced by
activated human T-lymphocytes, to chromosome 17. I309 is structurally
related to the CXC group of proteins. The homologous mouse gene is
termed Tca-3.

ACTIVE REGULATOR OF SIRT1; AROS;;
MGC52010
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis to screen a mouse embryonic cDNA library
with rat ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19; 603474) as bait, Maeda et al.
(2006) isolated 3 cDNA clones. Using in vitro binding assays, they
demonstrated that the product of the mouse cDNAs interacted with
ribosomal protein S19 but not with other ribosomal proteins tested,
including RPS3A (180478), RPL5 (603634), and RPL7A (185640). The mouse
Rps19bp1 cDNA, which the authors called S19bp, encodes a deduced
142-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of approximately
16 kD. The protein contains 2 basic amino acid clusters, one of which
has a variable polylysine tract embedded in a putative nucleolar
localization signal. By dot-blot hybridization analysis, Maeda et al.
(2006) detected expression of Rps19bp1 in all mouse tissues examined,
with highest expression in submaxillary gland and epididymis.
Immunofluorescence localization experiments in Cos-7 cells demonstrated
colocalization of Rps19bp1 and Rps19 in the nucleolus, with partial
diffusion of Rps19bp1 into the nucleoplasm.

Using SIRT1 (604479) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell
cDNA library, Kim et al. (2007) cloned full-length RPS19BP1, which they
called AROS. The deduced protein contains 142 amino acids. Northern blot
analysis detected AROS expression in heart, liver, small intestine, and
lung. Endogenous AROS showed nuclear localization in a human lung cancer
cell line. Fluorescence-tagged AROS was dispersed in the nucleoplasm in
half of transfected cells and showed distinct nuclear foci in the other
half.

GENE FUNCTION

Using several in vitro binding assays and analysis of deletion mutants,
Maeda et al. (2006) demonstrated that mouse Rps19bp1 specifically binds
ribosomal protein S19 and that binding activity is contained within
amino acids 81-142 of Rps19bp1.

Using protein pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays, Kim et al.
(2007) confirmed that human AROS interacted with SIRT1, and mutation
analysis identified an N-terminal domain in SIRT1 that was required for
the interaction. AROS enhanced SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of p53
(TP53; 191170) in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. AROS also enhanced
SIRT1 activity in vivo, which inhibited p53-mediated transcriptional
activity; both SIRT1 and AROS were required for p53 inactivation. AROS
also regulated p53-induced cell growth in response to DNA damage. Kim et
al. (2007) concluded that AROS is a key regulator of SIRT1, with
suppressive effects on p53.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Maeda et al. (2006) mapped the human
RPS19BP1 gene to chromosome 22p and the mouse homolog to chromosome 15.

;;PROTEIN 4.1, RED BLOOD CELL TYPE; 4.1R;;
EL1 GENE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Conboy et al. (1986) reported the molecular cloning and characterization
of human erythrocyte protein 4.1 cDNA and the complete amino acid
sequence of the protein. Probes prepared from the cloned erythrocyte
protein 4.1 cDNA hybridized with distinct mRNA species from a wide
variety of nonerythroid tissues, including brain, liver, placenta,
pancreas, and intestine, implying substantial homology between erythroid
and nonerythroid protein 4.1. Brain protein 4.1, also known as synapsin
I (313440), is the best characterized of the nonerythroid forms.

Tang et al. (1988) compared nucleotide sequences of mRNA encoding
erythroid and lymphoid protein 4.1 isoforms. The lymphoid protein 4.1
isoforms exhibited several nucleotide sequence motifs that appeared
either to be inserted into or deleted from the mRNA by alternative
splicing of a common mRNA precursor. One of the motifs, located within
the spectrin-actin binding domain, was found only in erythroid cells and
was specifically produced during erythroid cell maturation. Conboy et
al. (1988) demonstrated that alternative splicing accounts for multiple
isoforms of protein 4.1 in red cells. In his Figure 2, Conboy (1993)
provided a map of the alternative splicing of protein 4.1 mRNA,
emphasizing the total chromosome relative to many combinatorial splicing
possibilities among the exons of the EPB41 gene. There are, furthermore,
2 AUG initiation codons, 1 of which accounts for an N-terminal extension
on the 80-kD gene product.

By tissue screening, Baklouti et al. (1997) examined the complex pattern
of alternative splicing variants of the protein 4.1 gene. They noted
that many splicing variations occur in the spectrin/actin binding (SAB)
domain. In particular, they found a 51-bp exon that was expressed almost
exclusively in muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Baklouti et al. (1997) determined that 22
exons spanning approximately 200 kb contain the entire erythroid and
nonerythroid coding sequences of the human protein 4.1 gene.

MAPPING

The protein 4.1 gene was mapped to chromosome 1pter-p32 (Conboy et al.,
1985, 1986) by hybridization to chromosomes sorted onto nitrocellulose
filters using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Studies of
translocations also localized the gene to chromosome 1pter-p32, the
region of the Rh gene (Kan, 1986). Thus, it seemed certain that the
protein 4.1 gene is mutant in Rh-linked elliptocytosis-1 (EL1; 611804).

Tang and Tang (1991) concluded that the EL1 gene is located in band
1p34.2-p33 on the basis of the FLpter value (the fractional length of
the total chromosome relative to the terminus of the short arm).

Parra et al. (1998) stated that the EPB41 gene is located on chromosome
1p33-p32.

Bahary et al. (1991) assigned the mouse Epb41 gene to chromosome 4.

GENE FUNCTION

The red cell membrane cytoskeletal network consists of spectrin (bands 1
and 2; see 182860 and 182870), actin (band 5; see 102630), and protein
4.1. Actin and protein 4.1 interact with spectrin at the junction of
spectrin heterotetramers. The resulting complex plays a critical role in
erythrocyte shape and deformability. (The protein band nomenclature
given here is that of Fairbanks et al., 1971.) Correas et al. (1986)
determined the complete primary structure of the functional site of
protein 4.1 involved in spectrin-actin associations. Antibodies against
2 different synthetic peptides of this portion of the protein inhibited
association between protein 4.1, spectrin, and actin.

Ponthier et al. (2006) stated that the 4.1R protein in early erythroid
progenitors, derived from transcripts in which exon 16 is skipped,
exhibits low affinity for spectrin and actin. In contrast, late-stage
erythroblasts include exon 16 and express a high-affinity isoform. This
stage-specific repression of exon 16 inclusion is mediated in part by
the binding of HNRNPA/B (602688) proteins to exonic splicing silencer
elements located within the exon. Ponthier et al. (2006) also found that
FOX1 (A2BP1; 605104) and FOX2 (RBM9; 612149) stimulate exon 16 splicing
into a 4.1R pre-mRNA minigene via specific binding to UGCAUG splicing
enhancer motifs downstream of exon 16.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Conboy et al. (1986) showed by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA
from an Algerian family that in affected members the mutant protein 4.1
gene had a DNA rearrangement upstream from the initiation codon for
translation. The mRNA from the mutant gene was aberrantly spliced.

Lambert et al. (1988) reported an elliptocytosis family in which an
apparent rearrangement of the coding region of the protein 4.1 gene led
to restriction fragment length polymorphism when DNA was tested using a
fragment of the cDNA that encompassed the coding region of the gene.

McGuire et al. (1988) described a distinct variant of protein 4.1 in
each of 3 families with elliptocytosis. Affected members of family C, of
Italian ancestry, had red cells with reduced content of protein 4.1 of
normal molecular mass (approximately 80 kD).

EVOLUTION

Tan et al. (2005) found that the EPB41 and EPB41L3 (605331) genes from
fish, bird, amphibian, and mammalian genomes exhibit shared features,
including alternative first exons and differential splicing acceptors in
exon 2. In all cases, the most 5-prime exon, exon 1A, splices
exclusively to a weaker internal acceptor site in exon 2, skipping a
fragment designated exon 2-prime. Conversely, alternative first exons 1B
and 1C always splice to the stronger first acceptor site, retaining exon
2-prime. These correlations were independent of cell type or species of
origin. Since exon 2-prime contains a translation initiation site,
splice variants generate protein isoforms with distinct N termini. Tan
et al. (2005) calculated that coupling between upstream promoters and
downstream splicing in EPB41 and EBP41L3 has been conserved for at least
500 million years.

ANIMAL MODEL

The complex EPB41 gene on human chromosome 1p encodes a diverse family
of protein 4.1R isoforms. The prototypic 80-kD 4.1R in mature
erythrocytes is a key component of the erythroid membrane skeleton that
regulates red cell morphology and mechanical stability. To study the
function of 4.1R in nucleated cells, Shi et al. (1999) generated mice
with complete deficiency of all 4.1R protein isoforms. These 4.1R-null
mice were viable, with moderate hemolytic anemia but no gross
abnormalities. Platelet morphology and function were essentially normal.
Nonerythroid 4.1R expression patterns revealed focal expression in
specific neurons in the brain and in select cells of other major organs,
challenging the view that 4.1R expression is widespread among
nonerythroid cells.

Epb41-knockout mice have fragmented red blood cells that lack
glycophorin C (GPC; see 110750). In Epb41-null murine erythroblasts,
Salomao et al. (2010) found that GPC distributed exclusively to the
nuclei, whereas in enucleating erythroblasts from wildtype bone marrow,
GPC partitioned almost exclusively to nascent reticulocytes, with little
or no GPC observed in plasma membranes of extruding nuclei. In contrast,
glycophorin A (GPA; see 111300) partitioning was not perturbed, and GPA
sorted to nascent reticulocytes in both Epb41-null and wildtype
enucleating erythroblasts. The findings indicated that GPC deficiency in
Epb41-null erythroblasts is attributable to markedly abnormal protein
partitioning during enucleation, and suggested that reticulocytes in
hereditary elliptocytosis may differ from normal reticulocytes in their
biophysical properties of membrane cohesion or membrane deformability.
The results also showed that cytoskeletal attachments are an important
factor in regulating transmembrane protein sorting to reticulocytes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 1
EPB41, 318-BP DEL

This mutation was first reported by Feo et al. (1980) and Tchernia et
al. (1981) in homozygotes and heterozygotes and by Alloisio et al.
(1985) in heterozygotes. In this form of elliptocytosis (611804),
Takakuwa et al. (1986) demonstrated restitution of normal membrane
stability by incorporation of purified protein 4.1 into deficient red
cells by exchange hemolysis.

In an Algerian family with hereditary elliptocytosis caused by
deficiency of erythroid protein 4.1 (described by Tchernia et al., 1981;
defect partially characterized by Conboy et al., 1986), Conboy et al.
(1993) delineated the defect by study of erythroid and nonerythroid
cells in 1 of the homozygously affected sibs. The molecular lesion was
shown to involve deletion of the downstream AUG initiation codon in 4.1
mRNA, thus leading to the absence of protein 4.1 in red cells. In
contrast, isoforms that use the upstream AUG were detected in
nonerythroid cells, thus explaining the absence of manifestations in
other organ systems. The lesion consisted of a 318-nucleotide deletion
that encompassed the downstream AUG but left the upstream AUG intact.
Normally, multiple protein 4.1 isoforms are expressed in a variety of
tissues through complex alternative pre-mRNA splicing events, one
function of which is to regulate use of 2 alternative translation
initiation signals. Late erythroid cells express mainly the downstream
initiation site for synthesis of prototypic 80-kD isoforms; nonerythroid
cells in addition use an upstream site to encode higher molecular mass
isoform(s).

In affected members of family N of Scottish-Irish descent, McGuire et
al. (1988) found heterozygosity for a high molecular weight form of
protein 4.1 at approximately 95 kD, referred to as protein 4.1(95).
Marchesi et al. (1990) described the site and nature of the insertion
resulting in protein 4.1(95) and the functional consequences of the
mutation. The elliptocytosis (611804) was mild without anemia. Protein
4.1(95) was found to contain an insertion of about 15 kD adjacent to the
spectrin/actin domain of the protein comprised, at least in part, of
repeated sequence. Conboy et al. (1990) used polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) techniques to clone and sequence mutant reticulocyte mRNAs and
correlate the duplication end points with exon boundaries of the gene.
Protein 4.1(95) mRNA was found to encode a protein with 2 spectrin/actin
binding domains by virtue of a 369-nucleotide duplication from the codon
for lys407 to that for gln529.

In affected members of family G, of Italian descent, McGuire et al.

weight forms of protein 4.1 at about 68 and 65 kD, referred to as
protein 4.1(68/65). The mutation was associated with moderate
elliptocytosis (611804) and anemia. Protein 4.1(68/65) was found to lack
the entire spectrin/actin binding domain. Conboy et al. (1990)
demonstrated that protein 4.1(68/65) mRNA lacked sequences encoding the
functionally important spectrin-actin binding domain due to a
240-nucleotide deletion spanning the codons for lys407 to gly486.
Marchesi et al. (1990) described the site and nature of the deletions
resulting in protein 4.1(68/65) and the functional consequences of these

ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 1
PROTEIN 4.1 MADRID
EPB41, MET1ARG

Dalla Venezia et al. (1992) studied homozygous hereditary elliptocytosis
(611804) in a Spanish patient whose parents were second cousins. He had
had intermittent jaundice and pallor since birth. During aplastic crisis
at the age of 31 years, the spleen was very large and was removed and
cholecystectomy for gallstones was also performed. Remarkable
hematologic improvement followed. The mother of the propositus was
healthy, although her blood smear showed elliptocytosis; the father was
deceased. Glycophorin C was sharply reduced. This finding, as in other
homozygous elliptocytosis cases, indicates that protein 4.1 stabilizes
glycophorin C (110750) in the membrane. Spectrin and actin were
slightly, yet significantly, diminished. Dalla Venezia et al. (1992)
demonstrated an abnormality in 4.1 cDNA, specifically an AUG-to-AGG
transversion in the downstream translation initiation codon, changing
methionine to arginine. No obvious disorders were noted in cell types
other than red cells or possibly sperm cells. The propositus, born in
1948, had infertility associated with azoospermia and a right
ureterocele. Whereas heterozygous 4.1(-) HE accounts for one-fourth to
one-third of all HE in Caucasians, the incidence of homozygous 4.1(-) HE
was, in the opinion of Dalla Venezia et al. (1992), lower than
anticipated. They suggested that some 4.1(-) HE alleles may not be
viable in the homozygous state by virtue of affecting all isoforms of
the protein and leaving all cells deficient in protein 4.1. This was the
first identification of a specific point mutation.

192225	TITLE *192225 VASCULAR CELL ADHESION MOLECULE 1; VCAM1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, a cell surface glycoprotein expressed
by cytokine-activated endothelium, mediates the adhesion of monocytes
and lymphocytes (Cybulsky et al., 1991). In inflammatory conditions and
in cardiac allografts undergoing rejection, VCAM1 is upregulated in
endothelium of postcapillary venules. Arterial expression of VCAM1 is
also found in experimental models of atherosclerosis in the rabbit.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cybulsky et al. (1991) demonstrated that VCAM1 is present in single copy
in the human genome and contains 9 exons spanning about 25 kb of DNA. At
least 2 different VCAM1 precursors can be generated from the human gene
as a result of alternative mRNA splicing events, which include or
exclude exon 5.

MAPPING

Cybulsky et al. (1991) mapped the VCAM1 gene to chromosome 1 by Southern
analysis of somatic cell hybrids. A study of 2 hybrid lines carrying
translocations involving chromosome 1 permitted regionalization to
1p34-p21. Fluorescence in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes
further narrowed the localization to 1p32-p31. (Another endothelial
leukocyte adhesion molecule, ELAM1 (131210), is located on chromosome 1,
but on the long arm.)

Kumar et al. (1994) mapped the murine Vcam1 gene to chromosome 3 near
Amy1.

GENE FUNCTION

In a review of molecular pathways controlling heart development, Olson
and Srivastava (1996) cited studies indicating that deficiencies of the
cell adhesion molecules VCAM and alpha-4 integrin (192975) result in
epicardial dissolution and subsequent myocardial thinning.

Lu and Cyster (2002) studied the mechanisms that control localization of
marginal zone B cells. They demonstrated that marginal zone B cells
express elevated levels of the integrins LFA1 (see 153370/600065) and
alpha-4 (192975)-beta-1 (135630), and that the marginal zone B cells
bind to the ligands ICAM1 (147840) and VCAM1. These ligands are
expressed within the marginal zone in a lymphotoxin-dependent manner.
Combined inhibition of LFA1 and alpha-4-beta-1 causes a rapid and
selective release of B cells from the marginal zone. Furthermore,
lipopolysaccharide-triggered marginal zone B cell relocalization
involves downregulation of integrin-mediated adhesion. Lu and Cyster
(2002) concluded that their studies identified key requirements for
marginal zone B cell localization and established a role for integrins
in peripheral lymphoid tissue compartmentalization.

Garmy-Susini et al. (2005) demonstrated that integrin alpha-4-beta-1 and
VCAM1 are expressed by proliferating but not quiescent endothelial cells
and mural cells, respectively. Antagonists of this integrin-ligand pair
blocked the adhesion of mural cells to proliferating endothelia in vitro
and in vivo, thereby inducing apoptosis of endothelial cells and
pericytes and inhibiting neovascularization. Garmy-Susini et al. (2005)
concluded that integrin alpha-4-beta-1 and VCAM1 facilitate a critical
cell-cell adhesion event required for survival of endothelial and mural
cells during vascularization.

Garrison et al. (2005) described cotransin, a small molecule that
inhibits protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum. Cotransin
acts in a signal-sequence-discriminatory manner to prevent the stable
insertion of select nascent chains (specifically VCAM1, and P-selectin,
173610) into the Sec61 translocation channel. Garrison et al. (2005)
concluded that the range of substrates accommodated by the channel can
be specifically and reversibly modulated by a cell-permeable small
molecule that alters the interaction between signal sequences and the
Sec61 complex. This has various implications for drug development.

Besemer et al. (2005) developed a very similar VCAM1 depressing agent,
which they called CAM741. CAM741 works similar to cotransin in that it
represses the biosynthesis of VCAM1 cells by blocking the process of
cotranslational translocation, which is dependent on the signal peptide
of VCAM1. CAM741 does not inhibit targeting of the VCAM1 nascent chains
to the translocon channel but prevents translocation to the luminal side
of the endoplasmic reticulum through a process that involves the
translocon component Sec61-beta (609214). Consequently, the VCAM1
precursor protein is synthesized towards the cytosolic compartment of
the cells, where it is degraded.

By in vivo selection, transcriptomic analysis, functional verification,
and clinical validation, Minn et al. (2005) identified a set of genes
that marks and mediates breast cancer metastasis to the lungs. Some of
these genes serve dual functions, providing growth advantages both in
the primary tumor and in the lung microenvironment. Others contribute to
aggressive growth selectivity in the lung. Among the lung metastasis
signature genes identified, several, including VCAM1, were functionally
validated. Those subjects expressing the lung metastasis signature had a
significantly poorer lung metastasis-free survival, but not bone
metastasis-free survival, compared to subjects without the signature.

Campbell et al. (2006) found that increased serum levels of soluble
VCAM1 predicted recurrent ischemic stroke (601367) in a study of 252
patients. A smaller but similar trend was noted for serum levels of
N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NPPB; 600295). Patients in
the highest quarters for both sVCAM1 and NT-proBNP levels had 3.6 times
the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke compared to patients in the lowest
quarters for both biologic markers.

By database analysis, Harris et al. (2008) identified a potential target
sequence for miR126 (MIRN126; 611767), a microRNA selectively expressed
in endothelial cells, in the 3-prime UTR of VCAM1. Transfection of human
endothelial cells with antisense miR126 permitted an increase in
TNF-alpha (TNF; 191160)-stimulated VCAM1 expression. Conversely,
overexpression of the miR126 precursor increased miR126 levels and
decreased VCAM1 expression. Decreasing endogenous miR126 levels
increased leukocyte adherence to endothelial cells. Harris et al. (2008)
concluded that miR126 inhibits VCAM1 expression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Taylor et al. (2002) identified 33 SNPs in the VCAM1 locus. They then
analyzed a subset of these SNPs in 51 cases of stroke in sickle cell
disease (603903) patients derived from a single institution in Jamaica
and in 51 matched controls. They found that the C variant allele of the
nonsynonymous SNP 1238G-C, which results in a gly413-to-ala amino acid
change (G413A), may be associated with protection from stroke (odds
ratio = 0.35). Dover (2002) stated that sickle cell disease is not a
single gene disorder and emphasized the need for further studies of the
relationship of VCAM1 to strokes in this disorder.

Idelman et al. (2007) stated that VCAM1 transcription induction is
highly dependent on cell and organ type and mode of stimulation by
various transcription factors. The authors identified 8 VCAM1 promoter
haplotypes comprising 13 SNPs previously identified by Taylor et al.
(2002) in African Americans. Functional cellular expression studies in T
cells stimulated by T-cell mitogens assessed the inducibility of
expression of the different haplotypes. A -540A-G SNP (dbSNP rs3783605)
was found to gain an ETS2 (164740)-binding site, which was postulated by
Idelman et al. (2007) to have functional importance.

602819	TITLE *602819 HISTONE GENE CLUSTER 1, H3 HISTONE FAMILY, MEMBER B; HIST1H3B
;;HISTONE GENE CLUSTER 1, H3B;;
HIST1 CLUSTER, H3B;;
H3 HISTONE FAMILY, MEMBER L; H3FL;;
H3/L
DESCRIPTION For background information on histones, histone gene clusters, and the
H3 histone family, see HIST1H3A (602810).

CLONING

Zhong et al. (1983) identified a gene encoding a member of the H3 class
of histones. Albig and Doenecke (1997) designated this gene H3/l.

By genomic sequence analysis, Marzluff et al. (2002) identified the
mouse and human HIST1H3B genes. They noted that all H3 genes in histone
gene cluster-1 (HIST1), including HIST1H3B, encode the same protein,
designated H3.1. H3.1 differs from H3.2, which is encoded by HIST2H3C
(142780), at only 1 residue, and from histone H3.3, which is encoded by
both H3F3A (601128) and H3F3B (601058), at a few residues.

MAPPING

By analysis of a YAC contig, Albig et al. (1997) mapped the H3/l gene to
6p21.3, within a cluster of 35 histone genes.

By genomic sequence analysis, Marzluff et al. (2002) determined that the
histone gene cluster on chromosome 6p22-p21, which they called HIST1,
contains 55 histone genes, including HIST1H3B.

GENE FUNCTION

See HIST1H3A (602810) for functional information on H3.1 and the H3
histone family.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wu et al. (2012) reported that a K27M mutation occurring in either H3F3A
or HIST1H3B was observed in 78% of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas
(DIPGs) and 22% of non-brain-stem gliomas.

Lewis et al. (2013) reported that human (DIPGs) containing the K27M
mutation in either histone H3.3 (H3F3A) or H3.1 (HIST1H3B) display
significantly lower overall amounts of H3 with trimethylated lysine-27
(H3K27me3) and that histone H3K27M transgenes are sufficient to reduce
the amounts of H3K27me3 in vitro and in vivo. Lewis et al. (2013) found
that H3K27M inhibits the enzymatic activity of the Polycomb repressive
complex-2 (PRC2) through interaction with the EZH2 (601573) subunit. In
addition, transgenes containing lysine-to-methionine substitutions at
other known methylated lysines (H3K9 and H3K36) are sufficient to cause
specific reduction in methylation through inhibition of SET domain
enzymes. Lewis et al. (2013) proposed that K-to-M substitutions may
represent a mechanism to alter epigenetic states in a variety of
pathologies.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Chemokines are a group of small (approximately 8 to 14 kD), mostly
basic, structurally related molecules that regulate cell trafficking of
various types of leukocytes through interactions with a subset of
7-transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptors. Chemokines also play
fundamental roles in the development, homeostasis, and function of the
immune system, and they have effects on cells of the central nervous
system as well as on endothelial cells involved in angiogenesis or
angiostasis. Chemokines are divided into 2 major subfamilies, CXC and
CC, based on the arrangement of the first 2 of the 4 conserved cysteine
residues; the 2 cysteines are separated by a single amino acid in CXC
chemokines and are adjacent in CC chemokines. CXC chemokines are further
subdivided into ELR and non-ELR types based on the presence or absence
of a glu-leu-arg sequence adjacent and N terminal to the CXC motif
(summary by Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000).

CLONING

The GRO1 gene (CXCL1; 155730) was initially identified by Anisowicz et
al. (1987) by its constitutive overexpression in spontaneously
transformed Chinese hamster fibroblasts. (The name GRO stood for
growth-related.) Subsequently, a protein with melanoma
growth-stimulating activity (MGSA) was shown to be identical. Haskill et
al. (1990) reported the identification of 2 other GRO genes, which they
called GRO-beta and GRO-gamma (GRO3, CXCL3; 139111). These 2 share 90%
and 86% identity at the deduced amino acid level with the original
GRO-alpha isolate. One amino acid substitution, proline in GRO-alpha by
leucine in GRO-beta and GRO-gamma, leads to a large predicted change in
protein conformation. Significant differences were also found in the
3-prime untranslated region, including different numbers of ATTTA
repeats associated with mRNA instability. DNA hybridization with
oligonucleotide probes and partial sequence analysis of the genomic
clones confirmed that the 3 forms are derived from related but different
genes. Expression studies revealed tissue-specific regulation as well as
regulation by specific inducing agents, including interleukin-1, tumor
necrosis factor, and lipopolysaccharide.

Wolpe et al. (1989) showed that macrophages, in response to endotoxin,
secrete a protein with a molecular mass of about 6,000 daltons and with
an affinity for heparin. They termed this protein macrophage
inflammatory protein-2 (MIP2). It is a potent chemotactic agent for
polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Subcutaneous administration caused a
localized inflammatory reaction. Partial N-terminal sequence data showed
similarity to the family of proteins of which the archetype is platelet
factor-4 (PF4; 173460). The sequence of the MIP2 gene was found to be
most closely related to that of the GRO-beta gene.

Tekamp-Olson et al. (1990) used a cDNA clone of murine Mip2 to clone
cDNAs for 2 human homologs, MIP2-alpha and MIP2-beta, which are highly
homologous to each other and to the previously isolated gene for MGSA.
Thus, the 3 GRO genes represent the human homologs of the murine Mip2
gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Haskill et al. (1990) reported the identification of 2 other GRO The
GROB gene consists of 4 exons, 3 introns, and a 3-prime untranslated
region of about 700 bp terminating at the polyadenylation site.

MAPPING

Studies by Haskill et al. (1990) indicated that the 3 GRO genes, GRO1,
GRO2, AND GRO3, map to chromosome 4q21.

By PCR analysis and mapping of YAC clones, O'Donovan et al. (1999)
localized a number of CXC chemokine genes to 4q12-q21. They proposed
that the order in this region is centromere--IL8--GRO1/PPBP
(121010)/PF4--SCYB5 (600324)/SCYB6 (138965)--GRO2/GRO3--SCYB11
(604852)--SCYB10 (147310)--MIG (601704)--telomere. The GRO2 gene was
localized to 4q12-q13.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nieuwenhuis et al. (2002) showed that clearance of intranasally applied
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is impaired in the lungs of CD1d
(188410)-deficient mice as well as in T cell-deficient mice. Failure to
clear the bacteria was associated with a markedly reduced influx of
neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in the early stages of
the infection, which was thought to result from impaired production of
chemokines such as Mip2 by alveolar macrophages. Prior administration of
alpha-galactosylceramide to wildtype mice induced almost complete
eradication of P. aeruginosa from their lungs, indicating that
activation of CD1d-restricted T cells by alpha-galactosylceramide is
critical in host defense against these bacteria. Sequential radiologic,
macroscopic pathology, and histopathologic analyses confirmed early
enhanced inflammation and resolution of inflammation and bacterial
phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages in the
alpha-galactosylceramide-treated mice, whereas control mice exhibited
higher numbers of bacteria, lung hemorrhage, and swelling. Flow
cytometric analysis demonstrated that the macrophage activation in
alpha-galactosylceramide-treated mice was associated with increased
numbers of Ifng (147570)-producing NKT cells. Nieuwenhuis et al. (2002)
concluded that activation of CD1d-restricted T cells is crucial in
regulating the antimicrobial immune functions of macrophages at the lung
mucosal surface and suggested that this activity may help in preventing
colonization in diseases such as cystic fibrosis (219700) and in
patients undergoing chemotherapy.

In diseased mouse and human arteries, Zhao et al. (2004) demonstrated
that 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO; 152390)-positive macrophages localize to
areas of neoangiogenesis and that these cells constitute a main
component of aortic aneurysms induced by an atherogenic diet containing
cholate in Apoe (107741) -/- mice. 5-LO deficiency markedly attenuated
the formation of these aneurysms and was associated with reduced matrix
metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2; 120360) activity and diminished plasma
macrophage inflammatory protein-1-alpha (CCL3; 182283), but only
minimally affected the formation of lipid-rich lesions. The leukotriene
LTD4 strongly stimulated expression of CCL3 in macrophages and CXCL2 in
endothelial cells. Zhao et al. (2004) concluded that the 5-LO pathway is
linked to hyperlipidemia-dependent inflammation of the arterial wall and
to the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysms through a potential chemokine
intermediary route.

;;BREAST BASIC CONSERVED GENE 1; BBC1;;
D16S444E
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Adams et al. (1992) identified a novel cDNA representing an mRNA showing
significantly higher levels of expression in benign breast lesions than
in carcinomas. In both tissues, expression was highest in epithelial
cells, as determined by in situ hybridization to tissue sections. The
protein deduced from the nucleotide sequence was highly basic with no
signal or transmembrane sequence, but 2 potential nuclear localization
signals. The cDNA hybridized to multiple sequences within both human and
other mammalian genomes and to single genomic sequences in Drosophila,
Physarum, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Thus the cDNA represents a
highly conserved gene sequence. Only 1 major transcript was identified
in human cells, but the existence of several pseudogenes was suspected.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, Kenmochi et al.
(1998) mapped the RPL13 gene to chromosome 16.

162096	TITLE *162096 MIDKINE; MDK
;;MIDGESTATION AND KIDNEY; MK;;
NEURITE GROWTH-PROMOTING FACTOR 2, FORMERLY; NEGF2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Midkine is a retinoic acid-responsive, heparin-binding growth factor
expressed in various cell types during embryogenesis. It promotes
angiogenesis, cell growth, and cell migration. Midkine is also expressed
in several carcinomas, suggesting that it may play a role in
tumorigenesis, perhaps through its effects on angiogenesis (summary by
Reynolds et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using mouse Mk to screen a midgestation human embryonic kidney cDNA
library, followed by screening a placenta genomic library, Tsutsui et
al. (1991) cloned human MDK, which they called MK. The deduced 121-amino
acid protein has a signal sequence and shares 87% identity with mouse
Mk. Orthologs of MK were detected in rat, cow, and chicken. The chicken
ortholog, Rihb, is a retinoic acid-induced heparin-binding protein. MK
shares about 50% amino acid homology with the human heparin-binding
protein pleiotrophin (PTN; 162095), with highest conservation in the
central part of the molecule and complete conservation of cysteine
residues. Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of about 1 kb in
adult human kidney and PA1 human teratocarcinoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Reynolds et al. (2004) found that hypoxia induced midkine expression in
alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary vasculature in a strain of mice
sensitive to hypoxia. Hypoxia induced expression of both HIF1-alpha
(603348) and midkine in human placental adenocarcinoma, mouse fetal lung
mesenchyme, and human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell lines. HIF1-alpha
induced midkine expression via regulatory elements in the mouse midkine
promoter. Chronic expression of midkine during embryonic development in
transgenic mice resulted in pulmonary arterial remodeling and
muscularization, but only during the postnatal phase of lung
development. In fetal mouse lung mesenchymal cells and transgenic mice,
midkine upregulated expression of myocardin (MYOCD; 606127), a regulator
of smooth muscle cell differentiation.

Intraperitoneal adhesions between organs or between organs and
peritoneal walls occur in more than 90% of cases involving major
abdominal operations. Using a model of postoperative adhesions and
Mk-null mice, Inoh et al. (2004) showed that midkine was fundamentally
involved in the formation of intraperitoneal adhesions, at least partly
by promoting migration of macrophages and neutrophils to the omentum.

Hobo et al. (2009) found that 5/6 nephrectomy in mice, a model of
chronic kidney disease, induced expression of midkine in lung, leading
to elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; 106180) activity and
plasma angiotensin II (106150) levels and subsequent hypertension.
Exposure to midkine enhanced ACE expression in primary cultured human
lung microvascular endothelial cells. Oxidative stress may have
contributed to midkine expression, since 5/6 nephrectomy induced
expression of NADH/NADPH oxidase-1 (NOX1; 300225), Nox2 (CYBB; 300481),
and Nox4 (605261). Furthermore, an antioxidant reduced midkine
expression and plasma angiotensin II levels and ameliorated hypertension
in 5/6 nephrectomized mice.

GENE STRUCTURE

Uehara et al. (1992) determined that the MDK gene contains 4 exons. The
5-prime flanking region adjacent to the start site contains 5 GC boxes,
a steroid/thyroid hormone receptor-binding site, and an A/T-rich island,
but there is no obvious CAAT box. Further upstream there is a region
with high GC content. The mouse Mdk gene has a similar organization,
with conservation of exons and significant homology in the 5-prime
region adjacent to the start site. There are 3 additional regions of
homology between mouse and human MDK in the 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, Eddy et al. (1991) demonstrated that
the MDK gene segregates concordantly with chromosome 11 and, using cell
hybrids carrying translocations involving chromosome 11, they mapped the
gene regionally to 11p13-p11. Kaname et al. (1993) mapped the MDK gene
to human chromosome 11p11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Simon-Chazottes et al. (1992) mapped the mouse Mdk gene to chromosome 2,
using an interspecific backcross panel and microsatellite polymorphisms
as markers. O'Hara et al. (1995) used somatic cell hybrid analysis and
interspecific backcross analysis, respectively, to map human Mdk to
chromosome 11p13-p11 and mouse Mdk to a syntenic region of mouse
chromosome 2. They also mapped an Mdk pseudogene to mouse chromosome 11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using microarray analysis, Ezquerra et al. (2005) found that aortae of
Mk -/- mice showed elevated expression of renin (REN; 179820),
angiotensinogen (106150), angiotensin II receptor-1 (AGTR1; 106165), and
angiotensin II receptor-2 (AGTR2; 300034) and decreased expression of
Ace.

604099	TITLE *604099 GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR, METABOTROPIC, 2; GRM2
;;MGLUR2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

L-glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central
nervous system and activates both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate
receptors (mGluRs). The mGluRs, which are G protein-coupled receptors,
have been divided into 3 groups on the basis of sequence homology,
putative signal transduction mechanisms, and pharmacologic properties.
Group II, which includes mGluR2 and mGluR3 (601115), and group III
mGluRs are linked to the inhibition of the cyclic AMP cascade, but
differ in their agonist selectivities.

CLONING

By screening human hippocampus and fetal brain libraries with rat mGluR2
cDNAs, Flor et al. (1995) isolated human mGluR2 cDNAs. Like other mGluRs
and G protein-coupled receptors, the predicted 872-amino acid human
mGluR2 protein contains a putative N-terminal signal sequence and 7
transmembrane domains. Human and rat mGluR2 are 97% identical on the
amino acid level. Northern blot analysis revealed that the human mGluR2
gene was expressed as a major transcript of approximately 3.5 kb and as
minor transcripts of approximately 5 and 7 kb in all tissues of the
adult central nervous system tested. When expressed in mammalian cells,
rat and human mGluR2 exhibited similar pharmacologic properties.

Tanabe et al. (1992) cloned rat brain cDNAs encoding mGluR2, mGluR3, and
mGluR4 (604100).

GENE FUNCTION

Poulopoulou et al. (2005) found significantly decreased GRM2 mRNA levels
in T lymphocytes of 20 patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS; 105400) compared to healthy controls and patients with
other neurologic disorders. The authors suggested that decreased levels
of GRM2 may play a role in glutamate excitotoxicity that has been
postulated in ALS disease pathogenesis.

Metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depression in the
ventral tegmental area efficiently reverses cocaine-induced
strengthening of excitatory inputs onto dopamine neurons. Mameli et al.
(2007) showed that metabotropic glutamate receptor long-term depression
is expressed by an exchange of GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors for
GluR2-containing receptors with a lower single-channel conductance. The
synaptic insertion of GluR2 depends on de novo protein synthesis via
rapid mRNA translation of GluR2. Mameli et al. (2007) concluded that
regulated synthesis of GluR2 in the ventral tegmental area is required
to reverse cocaine-induced synaptic plasticity.

Gonzalez-Maeso et al. (2008) demonstrated that mGluR2 interacts through
specific transmembrane helix domains with HTR2A (182135), a member of an
unrelated G protein-coupled receptor family, to form functional
complexes in brain cortex. The serotonin HTR2A receptor-mGluR2 complex
triggers unique cellular responses when targeted by hallucinogenic
drugs, and activation of mGluR2 abolishes hallucinogen-specific
signaling and behavioral responses. In postmortem schizophrenic human
brain from untreated subjects, HTR2A is upregulated and mGluR2 is
downregulated, a pattern that could predispose to psychosis.
Gonzalez-Maeso et al. (2008) concluded that the HTR2A-mGluR2 complex may
be involved in the altered cortical processes of schizophrenia.

GENE STRUCTURE

Marti et al. (2002) demonstrated that the GRM2 gene contains 5 exons,
with sizes ranging from 74 to 1,076 bp.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Flor et al. (1995) mapped
the human GRM2 gene to chromosome 3. By radiation hybrid analysis, Marti
et al. (2002) sublocalized the GRM2 gene to 3p21.2-p21.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

The mGluR2 gene is expressed in the presynaptic elements of hippocampal
mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. Yokoi et al. (1996) found that knockout mice
deficient in mGluR2 lacked long-term depression (LTD) induced by
low-frequency stimulation at hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 synapses.
However, the mutant mice performed normally in water maze learning
tasks. The authors concluded that the presynaptic mGluR2 is essential
for inducing LTD at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapses, but that this
hippocampal LTD may not be required for spatial learning.

Morishima et al. (2005) generated mGluR2 -/- mice and observed a
significant increase in locomotor sensitization and conditioned place
preference in association with repeated cocaine administration compared
to their wildtype littermates. In vivo microdialysis analysis after
cocaine administration revealed increased extracellular levels of
dopamine and a markedly changed response pattern of glutamate release in
the nucleus accumbens of mGluR2-null mice. The null mice also exhibited
impaired motor coordination in the accelerating rota-rod test and
hyperlocomotion in novel environmental and stressful conditions.
Morishima et al. (2005) concluded that mGluR2 contributes to behavioral
responses implicated in reinforcement and addiction to cocaine, and
plays a pivotal role in synaptic regulation of glutamatergic
transmission in the neural network.

605213	TITLE *605213 3-@PHOSPHOINOSITIDE-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE 1; PDPK1
;;PDK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Isoforms of protein kinase B (PKB, or AKT1; 164730) are overexpressed in
some ovarian, pancreatic, and breast cancer cells, and PKB has been
shown to protect cells from apoptosis. Activation of PKB, which is
preventable by inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (see PIK3CG;
601232), is stimulated by insulin or growth factors after
phosphorylation of PKB at thr308 and ser473. Alessi et al. (1997)
biochemically purified a protein kinase, which they called PDK1, that
phosphorylates PKB at thr308 in response to phosphatidylinositol
3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) or phosphatidylinositol
3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) and enhances PKB activity. By
microsequence analysis of the approximately 67- to 69-kD PDK1 protein,
searching an EST database, and probing a breast cancer cell line cDNA
library, Alessi et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding PDK1, also called
PDPK1. Sequence analysis predicted that the 556-amino acid PDPK1 protein
contains a catalytic domain with 11 classic kinase subdomains and a
C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Alessi et al. (1997) found that expression of recombinant PDPK1 resulted
in the activation and phosphorylation of PKB at thr308 in a
PtdIns(3,4,5)P3- or PtdIns(3,4)P2-dependent manner via the PH domains.

Stephens et al. (1998) demonstrated that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and
PtdIns(3,4)P2 bind to the PH domains of PKB and PDPK1, causing their
translocation to the membrane and leading to PKB activation.

Pullen et al. (1998) showed that PDPK1 selectively phosphorylates the
70-kD ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70-RPS6K) at thr229, which is
required for its activation. Thr229 of p70-RPS6K is homologous to thr308
of the PKB protein.

Using transfected HEK293 cells stimulated with pervanadate or insulin,
Park et al. (2001) found that PDK1 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and
translocates to the plasma membrane. Following pervanadate treatment,
PDK1 kinase activity increased 1.5- to 3-fold, whereas the activity of
PDK1 associated with the plasma membrane increased approximately 6-fold.
The activity localized to the plasma membrane was also increased by
insulin treatment. Using site-directed mutants, they determined that
phosphorylation of tyr373/tyr376 is important for PDK1 activity.

Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B (see 164011) after
engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) is important for T cell
proliferation and activation during the adaptive immune response. Lee et
al. (2005) demonstrated that PDK1 has an essential role in this pathway
by regulating the activation of PKC-theta (PRKCQ; 600448) and through
signal-dependent recruiting of both PKC-theta and CARD11 (607210) to
lipid rafts. PDK1-associated PKC-theta recruits the IKK complex, whereas
PDK1-associated CARD11 recruits the Bcl10-MALT1 complex (see 604860),
thereby allowing activation of the IKK complex through
Bcl10-MALT1-dependent ubiquitination of the IKK complex subunit NEMO
(300248). Lee et al. (2005) concluded that PDK1 plays a critical role by
nucleating the TCR-induced NF-kappa-B activation pathway in T cells.

Gruber et al. (2006) commented on the study of Lee et al. (2005),
stating they observed that PKC-theta is phosphorylated on the activation
loop at thr538 before T cell activation. The results of Gruber et al.
(2006) are therefore inconsistent with the conclusions of Lee et al.
(2005) that thr538 phosphorylation of PKC-theta is regulated by T-cell
receptor activation. They postulated that other mechanisms, such as
autophosphorylation of thr219, might orchestrate the cellular function
of PKC-theta in T cells. Lee et al. (2006) responded to the comments of
Gruber et al. (2006) to state that several other groups have replicated
their data regarding inducible phosphorylation of thr538 in T cells. Lee
et al. (2006) noted that although the physiologic relevance of the
discrepancy is unclear, substantial differences and experimental
conditions and reagents may have accounted for the conflicting
observations.

In 3-dimensional matrices, cancer cells move with a rounded, amoeboid
morphology that is controlled by ROCK1-dependent contraction of
actomyosin. Using human cancer cell lines, Pinner and Sahai (2008)
showed that PDK1 was required for phosphorylation of myosin light chain
(see 160780) and cell motility, both on deformable gels and in vivo.
Depletion of PDK1 via RNA interference altered the localization of ROCK1
and reduced its ability to drive cortical actomyosin contraction. This
form of ROCK1 regulation did not require PDK1 kinase activity. Instead,
PDK1 competed directly with RHOE (RND3; 602924) for binding to ROCK1 and
opposed inhibition of ROCK1 by RHOE.

MAPPING

Alessi et al. (1997) and Stephens et al. (1998) mapped the PDPK1 gene to
16p13.3 based on its identity to a sequence located in the same region
as the PKD1 (601313) and TSC2 (191092) loci (Burn et al., 1996).

ANIMAL MODEL

Lawlor et al. (2002) found that Pdk1-null mice died at embryonic day 9.5
with multiple abnormalities, including lack of somites, forebrain, and
neural crest-derived tissues. Development of hind- and midbrain,
however, proceeded relatively normally. Lawlor et al. (2002) developed a
mouse strain that showed reduced levels of Pdk1 activity. These
hypomorphic Pdk1 mice were viable and fertile, and insulin injection
induced the normal phosphorylation responses attributed to Pdk1
activation. Nevertheless, these mice were 40 to 50% smaller than control
animals. The organ volumes from the Pdk1 hypomorphic mice were reduced
proportionally, and the volume of a number of Pdk1-deficient cells was
reduced by 35 to 60%. Pdk1 deficiency seemed to regulate cell size
directly and independently of cell number or proliferation rate.

The PDK1 'master kinase' mediates activation of AGC serine kinases (PKA,
PKG, and PKC (see 176960)) by phosphorylating them at the 'T-loop' site
of their catalytic domains. In order to determine the role of AGC serine
kinases in T-cell development, Hinton et al. (2004) used conditional
gene deletion of Pdk1 in mouse T cells to avoid embryonic lethality.
Complete loss of Pdk1 blocked T-cell differentiation in thymus, whereas
reducing Pdk1 activity to 10% of normal allowed differentiation to
proceed but blocked thymic expansion.

Hashimoto et al. (2006) investigated the role of PDK1, a
serine-threonine kinase, in regulating islet mass via a signaling
pathway that includes INSR (147670) or IGF1R (147370), IRS1 (147545),
and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Hashimoto et al. (2006) showed
that mice lacking Pdk1 specifically in pancreatic beta cells developed
progressive hyperglycemia as a result of loss of islet mass. The mice
showed reductions in islet density as well as in number and size of beta
cells. Haploinsufficiency of the Foxo1 gene (136533) resulted in a
marked increase in the number, but not the size, of beta cells and
resulted in restoration of glucose homeostasis in beta cell-specific
Pdk1-null mice. Hashimoto et al. (2006) suggested that PDK1 is important
in maintenance of pancreatic beta cell mass and glucose homeostasis.

In mice lacking Pdk1 in oocytes, Reddy et al. (2009) demonstrated that
the majority of primordial follicles were depleted around the onset of
sexual maturity, causing premature ovarian failure (POF) during early
adulthood. Suppressed PDK1-Akt1 (164730)-S6K1 (RPS6KB1; 608938)-RPS6
(180460) signaling in oocytes appeared to be responsible for the loss of
primordial follicles, and mice lacking the Rps6 gene in oocytes showed
POF similar to that in Pdk1-deficient mice. Reddy et al. (2009)
concluded that the PI3K/PTEN (601728)-PDK1 signaling pathway in oocytes
controls the survival, loss, and activation of primordial follicles
(which together determine reproductive aging and the length of
reproductive life in females), and that underactivation or
overactivation of the pathway in oocytes may cause POF and infertility.

612174	TITLE *612174 CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN 39; CAB39
;;MO25-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases using peptide fragments of proteins that
interacted with the serine/threonine protein kinase LKB1 (STK11; 602216)
in HeLa cells, Boudeau et al. (2003) identified CAB39, which they
designated MO25-alpha. The deduced 341-amino acid protein shares a high
degree of conservation with its C. elegans and Drosophila orthologs.
Northern blot analysis detected a 4.2-kb MO25-alpha transcript in all
tissues examined, with highest expression in skeletal muscle. Western
blot analysis detected MO25-alpha in most tissues and cell lines
examined. Endogenous MO25-alpha in HeLa cells had an apparent molecular
mass of 40 kD by SDS-PAGE.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis of human and rat cells, Boudeau et al.
(2003) showed that MO25-alpha associated with STRAD-alpha (608626) and
LKB1. Cotransfection and mutation analysis revealed that MO25-alpha
interacted directly with STRAD-alpha rather than with LKB1, and the
interaction required the last 3 residues of STRAD-alpha. MO25-alpha also
interacted with STRAD-beta (ALS2CR2; 607333) in a complex with LKB1.
MO25-alpha and STRAD-alpha anchored LKB1 in the cytoplasm, excluding it
from the nucleus. Moreover, MO25-alpha enhanced formation of
LKB1-STRAD-alpha complexes in vivo and stimulated LKB1 catalytic
activity about 10-fold. Boudeau et al. (2003) concluded that MO25-alpha
may function as a scaffolding component of the LKB1-STRAD complex and
regulate LKB1 activity and cellular localization.

Using mutagenesis, Boudeau et al. (2004) identified 2 binding sites on
opposite surfaces of MO25-alpha that were required for assembly of the
MO25-alpha-STRAD-alpha-LKB1 complex.

Denning et al. (2012) identified a mechanism of cell extrusion that is
caspase-independent and that can eliminate a subset of the C. elegans
cells programmed to die during embryonic development. In wildtype
animals, these cells die soon after their generation through
caspase-mediated apoptosis. However, in mutants lacking all 4 C. elegans
caspase genes, these cells were eliminated by being extruded from the
developing embryo into the extraembryonic space of the egg. The shed
cells showed apoptosis-like cytologic and morphologic characteristics,
indicating that apoptosis can occur in the absence of caspases in C.
elegans. Denning et al. (2012) described a kinase pathway required for
cell extrusion involving Par4, Strd1, and Mop25.1/25.2, the C. elegans
homologs of the mammalian tumor suppressor kinase LKB1 (602216) and its
binding partners STRAD-alpha (608626) and MO25-alpha. The AMPK-related
kinase Pig1, a possible target of the Par4-Strd1-Mop25 kinase complex,
is also required for cell shedding. Pig1 promotes shed cell detachment
by preventing the cell surface expression of cell adhesion molecules.
Denning et al. (2012) concluded that their findings revealed a mechanism
for apoptotic cell elimination that is fundamentally distinct from that
of canonical programmed cell death.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Zeqiraj et al. (2009) described the structure of the core heterotrimeric
LKB1-STRAD-alpha-MO25-alpha complex, revealing an unusual allosteric
mechanism of LKB1 activation. STRAD-alpha adopts a closed conformation
typical of active protein kinases and binds LKB1 as a pseudosubstrate.
STRAD-alpha and MO25-alpha promote the active conformation of LKB1,
which is stabilized by MO25-alpha interacting with the LKB1 activation
loop. Zeqiraj et al. (2009) suggested that this previously undescribed
mechanism of kinase activation may be relevant to understanding the
evolution of other pseudokinases, and also commented that the structure
reveals how mutations found in Peutz-Jeghers (175200) syndrome and in
various sporadic cancers impair LKB1 function.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CAB39
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP RH94102).

;;CHRNA;;
ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR, MUSCLE, ALPHA SUBUNIT; ACHRA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The acetylcholine receptor of muscle, like the nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor of the Torpedo electric organ, has 5 subunits of 4 different
types: 2 alpha and 1 each of beta, gamma, and delta subunits. In the
electric organ the subunits show conspicuous sequence homology. The
transmembrane topology of the subunits and the location of functionally
important regions, such as the acetylcholine-binding site and the
transmembrane segments involved in the ionic channel, have been
proposed.

CLONING

Noda et al. (1983) cloned cDNA for the alpha subunit precursor of the
calf skeletal muscle AChR and a human genomic DNA segment containing the
CHRNA1 gene. Nucleotide sequences showed marked homology with the
counterpart of Torpedo sp. (electric ray).

Analyzing acetylcholine receptor clones isolated from a human leg muscle
cDNA library, Beeson et al. (1990) found that the alpha subunit exists
in 2 isoforms. A novel 75-nucleotide exon P3A, between exons 3 and 4,
results in the insertion of 25 amino acids into the alpha subunit,
giving the new isoform 462 amino acids. The transcript lacking P3A
(P3A-) encodes a functional subunit, whereas the transcript containing
P3A (P3A+) encodes a nonfunctional subunit. The P3A- and P3A+
transcripts are generated in a 1:1 ratio in human muscle (Masuda et al.,
2008).

Schoepfer et al. (1988) showed that a human medulloblastoma cell line
expressed a muscle type rather than a neuronal type of acetylcholine
receptor. They succeeded in isolating cDNA clones for the alpha subunit
and suggested that these should be useful in obtaining large amounts of
human muscle-type acetylcholine receptor alpha-subunit protein for
studies of the autoimmune response in myasthenia gravis (see 601462).

Keiger et al. (2003) surveyed the developmental expression of nicotinic
receptors, including CHRNA1, in chick and human spinal cord.

GENE STRUCTURE

The protein-coding sequence of the human ACHRA gene is divided into 9
exons that correspond to different structural and functional domains of
the precursor molecule (Noda et al., 1983).

Beeson et al. (1990) identified the exon P3A and found that CHNRA1 gene
is alternatively spliced. Masuda et al. (2008) found that a -8G
nucleotide in intron 3 is an essential nucleotide of an intronic
splicing silencer (ISS) that markedly decreases recognition of exon P3A
by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H (HNRPH1; 601035).
They showed that hnRNP H is the transfactor that normally binds to this
ISS and suppresses expression of P3A.

MAPPING

By means of somatic cell hybridization, Beeson et al. (1989, 1990)
assigned the CHRNA gene to chromosome 2; by in situ hybridization, they
regionalized the gene to 2q24-q32, with the major peak of grains being
at 2q32. By linkage analysis, Lobos (1993) placed the CHRNA gene about
27 cM proximal to the crystallin G pseudogene marker, CRYGP1, located at
2q33-q35; the CHRND (100720) and CHRNG (100730) loci were placed about
31 cM distal to CRYGP1.

Heidmann et al. (1986) mapped the mouse alpha subunit gene to chromosome
17, but Taylor and Rowe (1989) determined that the mouse Chrna1 gene is
in fact located on chromosome 2.

GENE FUNCTION

Giraud et al. (2007) described a mechanism controlling thymic
transcription of a prototypic tissue-restricted human autoantigen gene,
CHRNA1. This gene encodes the alpha subunit of the muscle acetylcholine
receptor, which is the main target of pathogenic autoantibodies in
autoimmune myasthenia gravis (254200). On resequencing the CHRNA1 gene,
Giraud et al. (2007) identified a functional biallelic variant in the
promoter that was associated with early onset of disease in 2
independent human populations (France and U.K.). The authors showed that
this variant prevented binding of interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF8;
601565) and abrogated CHRNA1 promoter activity in thymic epithelial
cells in vitro. Notably, both the CHRNA1 promoter variant and AIRE
(607358) modulated CHRNA1 mRNA levels in human medullary thymic
epithelial cells ex vivo and also in a transactivation assay. Giraud et
al. (2007) concluded that their findings revealed a critical function of
AIRE and the interferon signaling pathway in regulating quantitative
expression of this autoantigen in the thymus, suggesting that together
they set the threshold for self-tolerance versus autoimmunity.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

By recording images at liquid-helium temperatures and applying a
computational method to correct for distortions, Miyazawa et al. (2003)
reported the crystal structure of the acetylcholine receptor of the
Torpedo electric ray at a resolution of 4 angstroms. The pore is shaped
by an inner ring of 5 alpha helices, which curve radially to create a
tapering path for the ions, and an outer ring of 15 alpha helices, which
coil around each other and shield the inner ring from the lipids. The
gate is a constricting hydrophobic girdle at the middle of a lipid
bilayer, formed by weak interactions between neighboring inner helices.
When acetylcholine enters the ligand-binding domain, it triggers
rotations of the protein chains on opposite sides of the entrance to the
pore. These rotations are communicated through the inner helices and
open the pore by breaking the girdle apart.

Lape et al. (2008) investigated partial agonists for 2 members of the
nicotinic superfamily, the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and
the glycine receptor (138491), and found that the open-shut reaction is
similar for both full and partial agonists, but the response to partial
agonists is limited by an earlier conformation change (flipping) that
takes place when the channel is still shut. Lape et al. (2008) suggested
that their observations have implications for the interpretation of
structural studies and for the design of partial agonists for
therapeutic use.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Myasthenia Gravis

Garchon et al. (1994) identified 2 stable polymorphic dinucleotide
repeats within the first intron of the CHRNA gene, designated HB and BB.
They found that the HB*14 allele conferred a relative risk for
myasthenia gravis (254200) of 2.5 in 81 unrelated patients compared with
100 control subjects. Very significantly, family analysis based on
haplotype segregation data indicated that parental haplotypes associated
with HB*14 always segregated to the child with myasthenia gravis,
whereas their transmission to unaffected sibs was as expected ('was
equilibrated,' in the words of the authors). Myasthenia gravis patients
always showed a high frequency of microsatellite variants not seen in
controls.

Giraud et al. (2007) found that the minor allele G of dbSNP rs16862847
was associated with early onset of disease in French and U.K. myasthenia
gravis patients in a combined sample of 96 patients in the lower
quartile of the age distribution versus 234 patients in the upper 3
quartiles of the age distribution and 260 controls (odds ratio = 2.19,
95% confidence interval 1.41 to 3.39, P = 0.00048). For heterozygotes
plus homozygotes for the G allele versus homozygotes for the A allele,
the odds ratio for early onset of myasthenia gravis was 2.66 (95%
confidence interval 1.6 to 4.41, P = 0.00015).

- Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes

In a patient with slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome (601462),
Engel et al. (1996) identified a heterozygous mutation in the CHRNA1
gene (100690.0001).

In 2 sibs with fast-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome (608930),
Wang et al. (1999) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in
the CHRNA gene (100690.0007; 100690.0008).

- Lethal Multiple Pterygium Syndrome

Michalk et al. (2008) reported 2 families in which homozygous nonsense
mutations in CHRNA1 (e.g., 100690.0013) caused lethal multiple pterygium
syndrome (253290).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, ASN217LYS

In a 30-year-old woman with slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome
(601462), Engel et al. (1996) identified a heterozygous 651C-G
transversion in exon 6 of the CHRNA1 gene, resulting in an asn217-to-lys
(N217K) substitution at a conserved residue in the M1 transmembrane
domain. The mutation cosegregated with the disease through 3
generations. Functional expression studies showed that the N217K
mutation slowed the rate of AChR channel closure, increased the apparent
affinity for ACh, and enhanced desensitization. Cationic overload of the
postsynaptic region caused an endplate myopathy.

.0002
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, VAL156MET

In a patient with SCCMS (601462), Croxen et al. (1997) identified a
heterozygous 466G-A transition in the CHRNA1 gene, resulting in a
val156-to-met (V156M) substitution in a putative ACh-binding region of
the protein. Functional studies suggested that the V156M mutation
stabilizes the open state of the AChR channel.

.0003
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, THR254ILE

In a 60-year-old woman whose myasthenic syndrome (SCCMS; 601462) had
first become symptomatic at the age of 16, Croxen et al. (1997)
identified a heterozygous 761C-T transition in the CHRNA1 gene,
resulting in a thr254-to-ile (T254I) substitution in the M2
transmembrane domain which lines the AChR channel pore. The patient was
previously reported by Chauplannaz and Bady (1994). Functional
expression studies suggested that the T254I mutation stabilized the open
state of the AChR channel.

.0004
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, GLY153SER

In 5 members of a family and another unrelated person affected by a
slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome (601462), Sine et al. (1995)
identified a heterozygous 457G-A transition in the CHRNA1 gene,
resulting in a gly153-to-ser (G153S) substitution in the extracellular
domain of the subunit. Electrophysiologic analysis of endplates revealed
prolonged decay of miniature endplate currents and prolonged activation
episodes of single AChR channels. Single-channel kinetic analysis of
engineered alpha-G153S AChR showed a markedly decreased rate of
acetylcholine dissociation, indicating an increased affinity for ACh,
causing the mutant AChR to open repeatedly during ACh occupancy. In
addition, ACh binding measurements combined with the kinetic analysis
indicated increased desensitization of the mutant AChR. Sine et al.
(1995) concluded that ACh binding affinity can dictate the time course
of the synaptic response.

Croxen et al. (1997) identified the G153S mutation in a 41-year-old
woman with SCCMS and her affected mother. Both patients were previously
reported by Chauplannaz and Bady (1994). The G153S substitution resides
in the putative ACh-binding domain of the protein, and functional
expression studies suggested that the G153S mutation impedes
dissociation of ACh from the AChR.

.0005
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, SER269ILE

In a 28-year-old woman who first developed symptoms of SCCMS (601462) in
the eighth month of her first pregnancy (Oosterhuis et al., 1987),
Croxen et al. (1997) identified an 806G-T transversion in the CHRNA1
gene, resulting in a ser269-to-ile (S269I) substitution. The mutation
lies within the short extracellular sequence between M2 and M3
transmembrane domains of the protein.

.0006
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, VAL249PHE

In a patient with a severe form of SCCMS (601462), Milone et al. (1997)
identified a heterozygous 745G-T transversion in exon 7 of the CHRNA1
gene, resulting in a val249-to-phe (V249F) substitution in the M2
transmembrane domain of the protein that does not face the channel
lumen. The patient's unaffected father was a mosaic for the mutation.
Functional expression studies showed that the V249F mutation causes
increased channel opening in the absence of ACh, prolonged opening in
the presence of ACh, increased affinity for ACh, and enhanced
desensitization. The findings indicated that the structure of the M2
domain is essential for correct stabilization of functional channel
states and that mutation in this region results in multiple functional
defects.

.0007
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, FAST-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, VAL285ILE

In 2 sibs with fast-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome (608930),
Wang et al. (1999) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in
the CHRNA gene. The functional mutation was an 853G-A transition in exon
7, resulting in a val285-to-ile (V285I) substitution in the upper third
of the M3 transmembrane domain. The other mutation was a 697T-G
transversion in exon 6, resulting in a phe233-to-val substitution
(F233V; 100690.0008) in the M1 transmembrane domain, causing markedly
reduced protein expression; this was essentially a null mutation.
Functional expression studies showed that the V285I mutation reduced the
amplitude of the miniature endplate current (MEPC), accelerated the
decay of the MEPC, and reduced total current flow through the AChR
channel. Kinetic analysis showed abnormally slow channel opening and
rapid closing, resulting in an abnormally brief current.

See 100690.0007 and Wang et al. (1999).

.0009
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, FAST-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, PHE256LEU

In a patient with fast-channel CMS (608930) originally reported by
Vincent et al. (1981), Webster et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous
766T-C transition in exon 7 of the CHRNA1 gene, resulting in a
phe256-to-leu (F256L) substitution in the M2 transmembrane domain of the
protein. Functional expression studies showed that the F256L mutation
results in fewer and shorter ion channel activations, with a decreased
channel opening rate and an increased channel closing rate. The
patient's mildly affected father also had the F256L mutation. Webster et
al. (2004) noted that autosomal dominant inheritance of fast-channel CMS
is rare.

.0010
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, FAST-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, VAL132LEU

In a girl with severe fast-channel CMS (608930), Shen et al. (2003)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the CHRNA1 gene: a
frameshifting null mutation (381delC; 100690.0011), and a 394G-C
transversion, resulting in a val132-to-leu (V132L) substitution, in a
highly conserved cys-loop at the junction between the extracellular
ligand-binding and transmembrane domains of the protein. Functional
kinetic expression studies showed that channels with the V132L mutation
had an increased dissociation constant for ACh, shorter burst duration,
and resistance to desensitization, culminating in a reduced probability
of channel opening over a range of ACh concentrations. The mutant
channel showed an approximately 30-fold decrease of ACh binding affinity
for the second of 2 closed-state binding sites, but only a 2-fold
decrease in gating efficiency. Mutations corresponding to the val132
residue in other AChR subunits showed different effects, indicating
functional asymmetry between cys-loops of the different subunits.

MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, CYS418TRP

In a 27-year-old man with congenital slow-channel myasthenic syndrome
(601462) and mild symptoms since birth, Shen et al. (2006) identified a
de novo heterozygous 1362C-G transversion in the CHRNA1 gene, resulting
in a cys418-to-trp (C418W) substitution in the M4 domain of the protein.
This residue is highly conserved across AChR-alpha subunits of different
species but not across individual subunits. Functional kinetic
expression studies in HEK cells showed that the AChR with the mutant
alpha-subunit increased the channel opening equilibrium and the mean
duration of open durations and bursts characteristic of a slow-channel
mutation. The C418W mutant subunit increased the rate of channel opening
and slowed the rate of channel closing, but had no effect on agonist
binding. Shen et al. (2006) used a check plasmid as a screening tool to
identify a specific siRNA that suppressed the mutant, but not the
wildtype allele, at the mRNA, protein, and functional levels in vitro.

.0013
MULTIPLE PTERYGIUM SYNDROME, LETHAL TYPE
CHRNA1, ARG254LEU

In a consanguineous Pakistani family, Michalk et al. (2008) demonstrated
that multiple pterygium syndrome (253290) was caused by homozygosity for
a G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 761 in exon 6 of the CHRNA1 gene
that resulted in an arg234-to-leu (R234L) substitution in the mature
protein (R254L in the precursor).

.0014
MULTIPLE PTERYGIUM SYNDROME, LETHAL TYPE
CHRNA1, 17-BP DUP, NT117

In a nonconsanguineous African family, Michalk et al. (2008) found that
multiple pterygium syndrome (253290) was caused by homozygous
duplication of 17 basepairs in exon 2 of the CHRNA1 gene, 117-133dup17,
that resulted in frameshift and subsequent premature protein termination
(H24RfsX19; H45RfsX19 in the precursor).

.0015
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, FAST-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, IVS3AS, G-A, -8

In a woman with autosomal recessive inheritance of fast-channel
congenital myasthenic syndrome (608930), Masuda et al. (2008) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the CHRNA1 gene: a G-to-A
transition in intron 3 (IVS3-8G-A) and a 937C-T transition in exon 7,
resulting in an arg313-to-trp (R313W; 100690.0016) substitution in a
highly conserved residue. Neither mutation was found in 200 control
alleles. Functional expression studies in HEK cells showed decreased
expression of the R313W mutant, which showed mild fast-channel
properties. The -8G-A transition occurred just before exon P3A, and
disrupted an intronic splicing silencer (ISS) sequence, resulting in the
inclusion of exon P3A and yielding a nonfunctional protein.

607298	TITLE *607298 GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING PROTEIN, GAMMA-13; GNG13
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heterotrimeric G proteins, which consist of alpha (see 139320), beta
(see 139380), and gamma subunits, function as signal transducers for the
7-transmembrane-helix G protein-coupled receptors. GNG13 is a gamma
subunit that is expressed in taste, retinal, and neuronal tissues and
plays a key role in taste transduction (Li et al., 2006).

CLONING

Huang et al. (1999) identified and cloned mouse Gng13 through its
interaction with alpha-gustducin (139395). By genomic sequence analysis,
they identified a human EST containing GNG13. The deduced 67-amino acid
GNG13 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 7.9 kD and shares about
96% sequence identity with mouse Gng13. Northern blot analysis of
several human tissues revealed a 1.2-kb transcript expressed strongly in
brain and weakly in small intestine and thymus. Low-level expression of
a 6.2-kb transcript was also seen in brain. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected a 0.5-kb transcript in brain, retina, and
olfactory epithelium, with lower expression in stomach and testis.
Transcripts of 2.1 and 4.8 kb were also detected in olfactory epithelium
and cerebellum. In situ hybridization of mouse circumvallate papillae
showed expression in taste receptor cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Huang et al. (1999) found that of 19 mouse taste receptor cells
expressing both alpha-gustducin and Gng13, all also expressed the
G-protein beta-3 subunit (GNB3; 139130), and 80% also expressed the
beta-1 subunit (GNB1; 139380). They determined that alpha-gustducin,
Gnb1, and Gng13 formed a heterotrimeric G protein capable of interacting
with receptors responsive to the bitter compound denatonium. Both
denatonium and a sucrose derivative caused the rapid generation of
inositol triphosphate in murine taste tissue. The denatonium response
depended upon a phospholipase C-beta-2 (PLCB2; 604114) isotype
specifically expressed in taste receptor cells, and the response could
be blocked by antibodies against Gng13.

Vertebrate retinas have distinct light-on (ON) and light-off (OFF)
channels that originate at the level of the retinal bipolar cells. For
the conversion from OFF to ON, ON bipolar cells use the GNAO1
(139311)-coupled glutamate receptor-6 (GRIK2; 138244) such that binding
of glutamate suppresses a cation current rather than activating it.
Using immunohistochemical analysis and single-cell PCR, Huang et al.
(2003) showed that Gng13 was coexpressed with the beta subunits Gnb3 and
Gnb4 (610863), but no other beta subunits, in dissociated mouse ON
bipolar cells. Huang et al. (2003) hypothesized that these G protein
subunits selectively participate in signal transduction in ON bipolar
cells.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse brain cDNA library, Li et al.
(2006) found that Gng13 interacted with Psd95 (DLG4; 602887) and Veli2
(LIN7B; 612331). Gng13 interacted specifically with the third PDZ domain
of Psd95 and the single PDZ domain of Veli2. Gng13 also interacted with
the third PDZ domain of Sap97 (DLG1; 601014). The C-terminal CAAX tail
of Gng13 was required for its interaction with Psd95. Coexpression of
Gng13 with Gnb1 did not interfere with these interactions. Protein
pull-down assays confirmed interaction of endogenous Gng13 with Psd95
and Sap97 in mouse brain and taste tissue, respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Huang et al. (1999) determined that the GNG13 gene contains 3 exons and
spans more than 2.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Huang et al. (1999) mapped the GNG13 gene
to chromosome 16p13.3.

612662	TITLE *612662 TBC1 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 15; TBC1D15
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse adipocyte cDNA library using the
cytoplasmic domain of VAMP2 (185881) as bait, followed by sequencing
murine EST clones and database analysis, Zhang et al. (2005) cloned
mouse Tbc1d15 and identified human TBC1D15. The deduced 691-amino acid
human protein shares 88% amino acid identity with its mouse homolog, and
both proteins contain the TBC domain (see 609850). TBC1D15 shares 46%
identity with TBC1D17. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected
2 variants in most tissues examined, with highest expression in heart,
liver, and testis and lower expression in brain, spleen, lung, kidney,
and skeletal muscle. Immunofluorescence studies showed a diffuse
intracellular distribution of Tbc1d15 in transfected COS-1 cells,
suggesting primarily cytosolic localization.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2005) used baculovirus-expressed protein to demonstrate
that Tbc1d15 has Rab-GAP activity. Tbc1d15 increased Rab7 (602298)
GTPase activity and showed a lower rate of increase in activity for
Rab11 (see RAB11A; 605570), but was largely inactive against Rab4
(179511) and Rab6 (RAB6A; 179513).

600426	TITLE *600426 E2F TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2; E2F2
DESCRIPTION See E2F1 (189971).

CLONING

Ivey-Hoyle et al. (1993) cloned a cDNA from a HeLa cell library using a
probe containing the DNA-binding domain of E2F1. The cDNA, designated
E2F2, has overall amino acid sequence similarity to E2F1 of 46%. The
same cDNA and corresponding genomic region was cloned by Lees et al.
(1993). Lees et al. (1993) also showed that expressed E2F2 bound to both
the E2F DNA recognition sites and to the RB1 protein (614041).

GENE FUNCTION

MYC (190080) induces transcription of the E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 (600427)
genes. Using primary mouse embryo fibroblasts deleted for individual E2f
genes, Leone et al. (2001) showed that MYC-induced S phase and apoptosis
requires distinct E2F activities. The ability of Myc to induce S phase
was impaired in the absence of either E2f2 or E2f3 but not E2f1 or E2f4
(600659). In contrast, the ability of Myc to induce apoptosis was
markedly reduced in cells deleted for E2f1 but not E2f2 or E2f3. The
authors proposed that the induction of specific E2F activities is an
essential component in the MYC pathways that control cell proliferation
and cell fate decisions.

The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (Rb) pathway is believed to have a
critical role in the control of cellular proliferation by regulating E2F
activities. E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 belong to a subclass of E2F factors
thought to act as transcriptional activators important for progression
through the G1/S transition. Wu et al. (2001) used a conditional gene
targeting approach to demonstrate that combined loss of these 3 E2F
factors severely affects E2F target expression and completely abolishes
the ability of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to enter S phase, progress
through mitosis, and proliferate. Loss of E2F function results in
elevation of CIP1 (116899) protein, leading to a decrease in
cyclin-dependent kinase activity and Rb phosphorylation. Wu et al.
(2001) concluded that these findings suggested a function for this
subclass of E2F transcriptional activators in a positive feedback loop,
through downmodulation of CIP1, that leads to the inactivation of
Rb-dependent repression and S phase entry. By targeting the entire
subclass of E2F transcriptional activators, Wu et al. (2001) provided
direct genetic evidence for their essential role in cell cycle
progression, proliferation, and development. Wu et al. (2001) initially
generated and interbred E2f1, E2f2, and E2f3 mutant mice, and found that
although mice null for E2f1 and E2f2 were viable and developed to
adulthood, mice null for E2f1 and E2f3 or E2f2 and E2f3 died early
during embryonic development, at or just before embryonic day 9.5,
pointing to a central role for E2F3 in mouse development.

Funke-Kaiser et al. (2003) identified 5 polymorphisms in the ECE1 gene
(600423), a candidate for human blood pressure regulation, among a
cohort of 704 European hypertensive patients. Electrophoretic mobility
shift assays revealed the specific binding of E2F2 to ECE1b promoter
sequences containing either allele of the C-338A polymorphism
(600423.0002), with the -338A allele being associated with an increased
affinity to E2F2 compared with -338C. The authors proposed a link
between the cell cycle-associated E2F family and blood pressure
regulation via a component of the endothelin system.

To address the function of E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 in normal mammalian
cells in vivo, Chen et al. (2009) focused on the mouse retina, which is
a relatively simple central nervous system component that can be
manipulated genetically without compromising viability and has provided
considerable insight into development and cancer. The authors showed
that unlike fibroblasts, E2f1-, E2f2-, and E2f3-null retinal progenitor
cells or activated Muller glia can divide. Chen et al. (2009) attributed
this effect to functional interchangeability with Mycn (164840).
However, loss of activating E2fs caused downregulation of the p53
(191170) deacetylase Sirt1 (604479), p53 hyperacetylation, and elevated
apoptosis, establishing a novel E2f-Sirt1-p53 survival axis in vivo.
Chen et al. (2009) concluded that activating E2fs are not universally
required for normal mammalian cell division, but have an unexpected
prosurvival role in development.

Using a panel of tissue-specific cre-transgenic mice and conditional E2f
alleles, Chong et al. (2009) examined the effects of E2f1, E2f2, and
E2f3 triple deficiency in murine embryonic stem cells, embryos, and
small intestines. They showed that in normal dividing progenitor cells,
E2f1-3 function as transcriptional activators, but are dispensable for
cell division and instead are necessary for cell survival. In
differentiating cells E2f1-3 function in a complex with Rb (614041) as
repressors to silence E2f targets and facilitate exit from the cell
cycle. The inactivation of Rb in differentiating cells resulted in a
switch of E2f1-3 from repressors to activators, leading to the
superactivation of E2f-responsive targets and ectopic cell divisions.
Loss of E2f1-3 completely suppressed these phenotypes caused by Rb
deficiency. Chong et al. (2009) concluded that their work contextualizes
the activator versus repressor functions of E2f1-3 in vivo, revealing
distinct roles in dividing versus differentiating cells and in normal
versus cancer-like cell cycles.

MAPPING

Lees et al. (1993) mapped the E2F2 gene to 1p36 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

ANIMAL MODEL

Iglesias et al. (2004) generated mice deficient in both E2f1 (189971)
and E2f2. The mice developed nonautoimmune insulin-deficient diabetes
and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction characterized by endocrine and
exocrine cell dysplasia and a reduction in the number and size of acini
and islets, which were replaced by ductal structures and adipose tissue.
Mutant pancreatic cells exhibited increased rates of DNA replication but
also of apoptosis, resulting in severe pancreatic atrophy. The
expression of genes involved in DNA replication and cell cycle control
was upregulated in the E2f1/E2f2 compound mutant pancreas. Iglesias et
al. (2004) suggested that E2F1/E2F2 activity negatively controls growth
of mature pancreatic cells and is necessary for the maintenance of
differentiated pancreatic phenotypes in the adult.

608081	TITLE *608081 SYNAPTOTAGMIN 15; SYT15
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SYT15 belongs to the synaptotagmin family of membrane trafficking
proteins. Synaptotagmins contain a short extracellular domain, a single
N-terminal transmembrane domain, and tandem C2 domains that can bind
several Ca(2+) ions.

CLONING

Fukuda (2003) cloned SYT15 from mouse, rat, and human tissues by PCR
using primers based on the SYT15 genomic sequence from each species.
They identified 2 alternately spliced transcripts of human SYT15 that
encode proteins with different C termini. The 421-amino acid isoform,
designated SYT15a, contains a short N-terminal transmembrane region
followed by putative fatty-acylation sites and 2 tandem C-terminal C2
domains. The 390-amino acid isoform, designated SYT15b, lacks the
C-terminal portion of the second C2 domain. SYT15a shares about 79%
identity with mouse Syt15a. RT-PCR of several mouse tissues revealed
expression of both variants in heart, lung, skeletal muscle, and testis,
as well as in 7-day embryos. Unlike several other synaptotagmins,
expression of Syt15 was nearly absent in mouse brain.

GENE FUNCTION

By expression of wildtype mouse Syt15a and a truncated mutant in COS-7
cells, Fukuda (2003) determined that the protein is expressed at the
membrane and that the N-terminal hydrophobic region is required for
membrane association. Fukuda (2003) also showed that Syt15a bound
phospholipids in a Ca(2+)-independent manner.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fukuda (2003) determined that the human SYT15 gene contains 9 exons and
the mouse and rat Syt15 genes contain 8 exons. The genes span 10 to 12
kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Craxton (2001) and Fukuda (2003) mapped
the SYT15 gene to chromosome 10. Fukuda (2003) mapped the mouse Syt15
gene to chromosome 14.

HEPARAN SULFATE N-DEACETYLASE/N-SULFOTRANSFERASE 2;;
HEPARAN N-SULFOTRANSFERASE 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The initial step in the processing of heparan polymers to heparan
sulfate or heparin is N-deacetylation/N-sulfation. This step is
catalyzed by heparan N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferases, such as NDST2
(Humphries et al., 1998).

CLONING

Using PCR of human endothelial cell cDNA with primers based on the
sequence of rat liver Ndst1 (600853), Humphries et al. (1998) isolated a
partial NDST2 cDNA. Using the partial cDNA to screen endothelial cell
and fibroblast libraries, they isolated cDNAs corresponding to the
entire NDST2 coding region. The predicted 883-amino acid protein is 70%
similar to NDST1. Northern blot analysis revealed that NDST2 was
expressed as a 4-kb mRNA and a less abundant 4.4-kb mRNA in all human
tissues tested. The strongest expression was observed in pancreas.

Orellana et al. (1994) and Eriksson et al. (1994) cloned cDNAs encoding
a heparan N-sulfotransferase from a heparin-producing mouse mastocytoma
cell line. Humphries et al. (1998) reported that the predicted mouse
protein is 94% identical to NDST2.

Aikawa et al. (2001) cloned mouse Ndst2, which encodes a deduced
883-amino acid protein. RT-PCR detected high Ndst2 expression in all
adult mouse tissues examined and in whole mouse embryos at all
developmental stages examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Using N-acetylheparosan purified from E. coli capsular polysaccharide as
substrate, Aikawa et al. (2001) found that recombinant mouse Ndst
enzymes showed distinct ratios of N-acetylglucosamine N-deacetylase to
N-sulfotransferase activities. Ndst2 had similarly robust activity in
both reactions with this substrate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Humphries et al. (1998) determined that the NDST2 gene contains 13 exons
spanning 6.5 kb. The 12 introns that interrupt the coding region occur
at similar sites within the coding sequence of NDST1. The similarity of
the NDST2 and NDST1 genomic organization and encoded proteins suggested
to Humphries et al. (1998) that the 2 genes derive from a common
ancestral gene.

Ahmed et al. (2001) stated that NDST2 is 1 of 3 genes that are nested in
the introns of PCDH15 (605514).

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Humphries et al. (1998) mapped
the NDST2 gene to 10q22.

EVOLUTION

Aikawa et al. (2001) determined that 3 gene duplication events likely
occurred to give rise to the 4 vertebrate NDST genes. They proposed that
after the initial gene duplication event, a duplication produced NDST1
and NDST2, followed by a much later duplication that produced NDST3
(603950) and NDST4 (615039).

ANIMAL MODEL

Forsberg et al. (1999) and Humphries et al. (1999) independently
targeted disruption of the mouse Ndst2 gene by homologous recombination.
Humphries et al. (1999) found that mast cells in the skeletal muscle
that normally contain heparin lacked metachromatic granules and failed
to store appreciable amounts of mouse mast-cell protease-4, mast-cell
protease-5, and mast-cell carboxypeptidase A (114851). Mast cells
developed from the bone marrow of the Ndst2 -/- mice contained high
levels of various protease transcripts and had substantial amounts of
mast-cell protease-6 (191080) protein in their granules. However, they
failed to express mast-cell protease-5 and mast-cell carboxypeptidase A.
Humphries et al. (1999) concluded that heparin controls, through a
posttranslational mechanism, the levels of specific cassettes of
positively charged proteases inside mast cells. Forsberg et al. (1999)
found that their Ndst2 knockout mice were unable to synthesize sulfated
heparin. The mice were viable and fertile, as were those of Humphries et
al. (1999), but had fewer connective tissue-type mast cells. The
connective tissue-type mast cells had an altered morphology and
contained severely reduced amounts of histamine and mast-cell proteases.
Commenting on the papers by Forsberg et al. (1999) and Humphries et al.
(1999), Zehnder and Galli (1999) stated that heparin had long been
thought to be a storage site in the mast-cell granule for the positively
charged amines histamine and serotonin. Forsberg et al. (1999) reported
that the peritoneal mast cells in their Ndst2-deficient mice showed a
large--roughly 94%--reduction in cell-associated histamine. Humphries et
al. (1999), however, reported a more modest reduction of about 30%.
Zehnder and Galli (1999) suggested that the discrepancies may be related
to the variation in the age of the mice studied, as mast cells can be
long-lived and accumulate additional granules with age, or that the
differences may be strain-dependent.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned WDFY4, which they designated
KIAA1607. The deduced protein contains 1,270 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected highest WDFY4 expression in spleen, followed by lung, kidney,
whole adult brain, spinal cord, all adult brain regions examined, and
fetal liver. Expression was weaker in adult liver, pancreas, ovary,
testis, and fetal brain, and little to no expression was present in
heart and skeletal muscle.

;;RETINOBLASTOMA PROTEIN-BINDING ZINC FINGER PROTEIN RIZ; RIZ
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PR domain is a protein-protein interaction module of about 100 amino
acids. PR domain-containing proteins, such as PRDM2, are often involved
in transcriptional regulation (Jiang and Huang, 2000).

CLONING

The RB1 protein (614041) is a target of viral oncoproteins. To explore
the hypothesis that viral proteins may be structural mimics of cellular
RB-binding proteins that normally mediate RB function, Buyse et al.
(1995) searched cDNA libraries for RB-binding proteins. They reported
the cloning of a cDNA for the zinc finger protein they called RIZ from
rat and human cells. It is a 250-kD nuclear protein containing 8 zinc
finger motifs. It contains an RB-binding motif that is related to that
of the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein; RIZ also shares an antigenic epitope
with the C terminus of E1A. It is expressed in human retinoblastoma
cells and at low levels in all other human cell lines examined. While
the function of RIZ was not clear, its structure and pattern of
expression suggested to Buyse et al. (1995) a role in transcriptional
regulation during neuronal differentiation and pathogenesis of
retinoblastoma.

Jiang and Huang (2000) reviewed the PR domain-containing protein family.
They stated that the full-length RIZ isoform, RIZ1, is a 1,719-amino
acid protein with an N-terminal PR domain, followed by an acidic region,
3 zinc fingers, a central GTPase domain, and a C-terminal region
containing a PEST sequence and 5 more zinc fingers. The acidic region
and first set of zinc fingers act as the RB-binding domain. The RIZ2
splice variant encodes a protein lacking the N-terminal PR domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

The RIZ gene contains at least 10 exons and spans more than 150 kb. The
majority of the RIZ1 transcript is encoded by exon 7. The RIZ2 splice
variant is produced by an internal GC-rich promoter located at the
intron-exon boundary of coding exon 5. (Jiang and Huang, 2000).

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Buyse et al. (1996) mapped the
RIZ gene to 1p36. To further determine the physical location, they
screened YACs from the CEPH human megaYAC library and found
hybridization to a YAC mapped to 1p36 that had been demonstrated to be
nonchimeric. Buyse et al. (1996) commented that RIZ may be a candidate
target of 1p36 alterations that commonly occur in neuroendocrine,
breast, liver, colon, and lymphoid tumors.

Mock et al. (1996) mapped the Riz gene to mouse chromosome 4.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The distal portion of chromosome 1p is one of the most commonly affected
regions in human cancer. In a study of hereditary and sporadic
colorectal cancer, Chadwick et al. (2000) identified a region of
frequent deletion at 32.2 centimorgans from 1ptel. Deletion breakpoints
clustered in the vicinity of or inside the gene RIZ. Sequence analysis
demonstrated frequent frameshift mutations of the RIZ gene. The
mutations consisted of 1- or 2-bp deletions of coding poly(A) tracts
(A)8 or (A)9, and were confined to microsatellite-unstable colorectal
tumors, being present in 9 of 24 (37.5%) primary tumors and in 6 of 11
(54.5%) cell lines; in 2 cell lines the mutation was homozygous (or
hemizygous). The mutations apparently were selected clonally in
tumorigenesis, because similar poly(A) tracts in other genes were not
affected. Of the 2 alternative products of the gene, RIZ1 contains a PR
domain implicated in tumor suppressor function and RIZ2 lacks this
motif. Chadwick et al. (2000) proposed that RIZ is a target of observed
1p alterations, with impairment of the PR domain-mediated function
through either frameshift mutation or genomic deletion.

Because alterations in the 1p36 region, where the RIZ gene is located,
had been described in malignant melanomas, Poetsch et al. (2002)
analyzed the RIZ gene in 16 typical nevi, 19 atypical nevi, 33 primary
melanoma lesions and 25 metastases, and DNA from 4 melanoma cell lines.
Frameshift mutations were found in 17% of melanoma samples and 8.6% of
nevi, but no missense mutations were found in the exons of RIZ. No LOH
of the RIZ gene and no microsatellite instability in 6 dinucleotide
markers or in the mononucleotide repeats MSH3 (600887) and MSH6 (600678)
could be demonstrated in the samples with RIZ frameshift mutations.
Although the results did not explain the high rate of deletions in 1p36
in melanoma, Poetsch et al. (2002) concluded that RIZ has a potential
role in the multistep tumor-forming process of malignant melanoma of the
skin.

Fang et al. (2001) identified a polymorphism in the RIZ gene consisting
of the presence or absence of a proline at codon 704 (P704). Grundberg
et al. (2004) performed in vitro studies comparing the abilities of RIZ1
P704 polymorphic variants (homozygous presence, P704+; absence, P704-;
heterozygosity, P704 +/-) to coactivate the ER-alpha (133430) and
examined association of the polymorphism to bone mineral density (BMD;
see 601884) in 343 Swedish women, aged 20 to 39 years. The expression
vector containing P704- RIZ1 showed an impaired response in coactivating
ER-alpha in a ligand- and dose-dependent manner compared with P704+ RIZ
(P less than 0.0001). The genotype frequencies were 19% (P704+), 32%
(P704-), and 49% (P704 +/-) and were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. BMD
at the heel was higher in the P704+ genotype group than in the P704 +/-
group (P = 0.02), which was evident also after corrections for fat and
lean mass (P = 0.03). Grundberg et al. (2004) concluded that RIZ1 may be
a candidate gene for involvement in the variation seen in BMD.

607818	TITLE *607818 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 365; ZNF365
;;SU48;;
KIAA0844
TALANIN, INCLUDED; TALN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned ZNF365, which they designated
KIAA0844. The deduced protein contains 407 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected high expression in brain and intermediate to low expression in
heart, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, spleen, testis, and
ovary. Little to no expression was detected in liver.

By positional cloning in the uric acid nephrolithiasis (UAN; 605990)
critical region on chromosome 10q, Gianfrancesco et al. (2003)
identified a novel gene, which they designated ZNF365. By database
searching, RT-PCR, and 3-prime and 5-prime RACE, they obtained a
full-length ZNF365 cDNA. They found that the ZNF365 gene encodes at
least 4 deduced protein isoforms of 407, 333, 462, and 216 amino acids,
designated ZNF365A-D, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous expression of a 5-kb ZNF36A transcript but no signal for the
other isoforms. By RT-PCR analysis, ZNF365A (KIAA0844) was expressed at
high levels in brain and at low levels in other tissues; ZNF365B is
expressed in placenta and at low levels in lung and liver; ZNF365C is
expressed only in kidney and pancreas; and ZNF365D is expressed in
placenta, lung, liver, kidney, and pancreas. Gianfrancesco et al. (2003)
found that the ZNF365D isoform, which they called talanin, was
completely included in the 67-kb critical interval identified for UAN by
linkage studies. Computer-assisted analysis revealed that ZNF365D has at
least 1 membrane-spanning domain and several N- and O-glycosylation
consensus sites at the N terminus, suggesting that it may be an integral
membrane protein.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunofluorescence microscopy, Wang et al. (2006) found that ZNF365A,
which they called SU48, localized to the centrosome throughout the cell
cycle in several human cell lines. The centrosomal localization of
ZNF365A was not affected by a microtubule depolymerizing agent. Mutation
analysis showed that the centrosomal localization of ZNF365A required 2
coiled-coil subdomains, but not the C-terminal zinc finger structure.
The coiled-coil structure was also involved in formation of homodimers
or multimeric assemblies. Overexpression of ZNF365A caused abnormal
mitosis, and a mutant form of ZNF365A lacking the C-terminal region
disrupted localization of gamma-tubulin (see 191135) to the centrosome.
Disruption of normal ZNF365A function led to mitotic failure, possibly
due to centrosome defects or incomplete cytokinesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gianfrancesco et al. (2003) determined that the ZNF365 gene contains 15
exons spanning approximately 300 kb. The gene has a complex pattern of
alternative splicing and transcriptional start sites.

MAPPING

By positional cloning, Gianfrancesco et al. (2003) identified the ZNF365
gene within the UAN critical region on chromosome 10q21-q22.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Gianfrancesco et al. (2003) performed mutation analysis of the ZNF365
gene in 8 patients with UAN and identified an ala62-to-thr mutation in
exon 12 of the ZNF365D isoform (A62T; 607818.0001), which was in strong
association with the disorder (P = 0.0051). Moreover, A62T modified
predicted protein secondary structure, suggesting that it may have a
role in UAN etiology.

For a discussion of a possible association between mammographic density
and variation in the ZNF365 gene, see 607308.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
URIC ACID NEPHROLITHIASIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
ZNF365, ALA62THR

In 8 patients with uric acid nephrolithiasis (605990), Gianfrancesco et
al. (2003) identified an ala62-to-thr (A62T) mutation in exon 12 of the
ZNF365 gene. Comparison of allelic frequency in a selected sample of 34
cases and 53 controls showed strong association between uric acid
nephrolithiasis and the A62T variant (P = 0.0096) with a significant
increase in risk (OR 2.73). The estimated penetrance of A62T showed an
increasing trend across genotypes: the penetrances of ala/ala
homozygotes, ala/thr heterozygotes, and thr/thr homozygotes were 17.6%,
32.3%, and 44.8%, respectively. Prediction of protein secondary
structure suggested that the substitution of threonine for alanine
causes a significant conformational change that may have important
implications for the biologic function of the ZNF365D protein or its
interaction with other proteins.

138380	TITLE *138380 GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE, MU-2; GSTM2
;;GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE 4; GST4;;
GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE M2;;
GST, MUSCLE; GSTM
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The glutathione S-transferases (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) are a family of
enzymes responsible for the metabolism of a broad range of xenobiotics
and carcinogens (Mannervik, 1985). This enzyme catalyzes the reaction of
glutathione with a wide variety of organic compounds to form thioethers,
a reaction that is sometimes a first step in a detoxification process
leading to mercapturic acid formation.

Based on amino acid sequence similarities and antibody
cross-reactivities, the mammalian cytosolic GSTs are divided into
several classes, including alpha (e.g., 138359), mu (e.g., 138350),
kappa (602321), theta (e.g., 600436), pi (134660), omega (605482), and
zeta (603758). In addition, there is a class of microsomal GSTs (e.g.,
138330). Each class is encoded by a single gene or a gene family.

CLONING

In muscle extracts, Van Cong et al. (1984) observed a novel GST band
(called GST4, or GSTM2), which migrated between GST3 (GSTP1; 134660) and
GST1 (GSTM1; 138350). No polymorphism was noted. The formation of
heterodimeric bands with GSTM1 indicated that GSTM2 is a dimeric enzyme
and that it is controlled by a separate gene. GSTM1, GSTM2, and GSTM3
(138390) are class mu isoenzymes. GSTM1 encodes an enzyme expressed in
liver and peripheral blood, while the products of GSTM2 and GSTM3 are
expressed in muscle and brain, respectively.

Vorachek et al. (1991) isolated a cDNA for GSTM2 from a human myoblast
cDNA library and determined its sequence. The deduced 217-amino acid
protein has a molecular mass of 25,599 Da. It shares 84.8% sequence
identity with the GSTM1 protein.

MAPPING

Taylor et al. (1991) demonstrated that GSTM2 and GSTM4 (138333) are
located on the same cosmid. Pearson et al. (1993) isolated a YAC clone
containing all 5 GSTM genes, GSTM1-5; using this clone, they mapped all
of these genes to 1p13.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

;;CHROMOSOME 10 OPEN READING FRAME 132; C10ORF132
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By PCR of human brain, Steck et al. (2007) cloned GOLGA7B, which they
called C10ORF132. The deduced 167-amino acid protein shares 78% identity
with GOLGA7 (609453). RT-PCR detected GOLGA7B expression in human brain,
but not in lung or chondrocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Steck et al. (2007) determined that the GOLGA7B gene contains 5 exons
and spans about 17.8 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Steck et al. (2007) mapped the GOLGA7B
gene to chromosome 10q22. The 3-prime exon of the GOLGA7B gene overlaps
the 3-prime exon of the CRTAC1 gene (606276), which is transcribed from
the opposite strand.

602856	TITLE *602856 REGULATOR OF G PROTEIN SIGNALING 10; RGS10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RGS proteins negatively regulate signaling pathways involving
7-transmembrane receptors and heterotrimeric G proteins. See 602189 for
background.

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid system with a mutationally activated form of rat
G-alpha(i3) as the bait, Hunt et al. (1996) isolated HeLa cell cDNAs
encoding RGS10. Like all members of the RGS family, the predicted
173-amino acid RGS10 contains a 120-amino acid core domain that is
strongly conserved with the yeast Sst2 protein. Northern blot analysis
detected an approximately 900-bp RGS10 transcript in HeLa cells, human
embryonic kidney 293 cells, and mouse brain.

By microarray analysis, Yang and Li (2007) found that RGS10 was highly
expressed in human osteoclastoma. Northern blot analysis confirmed high
RGS10 expression in osteoclastoma and detected weaker expression in
brain, liver, kidney, and the Hep2 cell line; no expression was detected
in other tissues and cell lines examined. Mouse Rgs10 was highly
expressed in preosteoclasts and osteoclasts derived from RANKL (TNFSF11;
602642)-stimulated bone marrow-derived monocytes, but it was not
expressed in osteoblasts or preosteoblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation studies, Hunt et al. (1996) demonstrated
that RGS10 associates specifically with the activated forms of the 2
related G protein subunits G-alpha(i3) and G-alpha(z) but fails to
interact with the structurally and functionally distinct G-alpha(s)
subunit. In vitro assays indicated that RGS10 potently and selectively
increases the GTP hydrolytic activity of several G-alpha(i) family
members.

Using human T cells silenced for or overexpressing RGS10, Garcia-Bernal
et al. (2011) showed that RGS10 inhibited G-alpha-dependent,
chemokine-upregulated T-cell adhesion mediated by alpha-4 (ITGA4;
192975)/beta-1 (ITGB1; 135630) and alpha-L (ITGAL; 153370)/beta-2
(ITGB2; 600065) integrins. The data suggested that RGS10 opposes
activation by chemokines of the VAV1 (164875)-RAC1 (602048) pathway in T
cells, leading to repression of adhesion strengthening mediated by
alpha-4/beta-1. RGS10 also limited adhesion-independent cell chemotaxis
and activation of CDC42 (116952).

GENE STRUCTURE

Sierra et al. (2002) determined that the RGS10 gene contains 5 exons and
spans 35 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sierra et al. (2002) mapped the RGS10 gene
to chromosome 10q26.11. They mapped the mouse Rgs10 gene to chromosome 7
by interspecific backcross mapping.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yang and Li (2007) obtained Rgs10 -/- mice at the expected mendelian
ratio, but they were smaller and had shorter limbs than their wildtype
littermates. Growth retardation became apparent during the first or
second postnatal week. Histologically, Rgs10 -/- mice exhibited severe
osteopetrosis. Disruption of Rgs10 impaired osteoclast differentiation
due to the absence of calcium current oscillations and loss of Nfatc1
(600489) expression. Ectopic expression of Rgs10 markedly enhanced
Rankl-induced osteoclast differentiation. Rgs10 competitively bound
Ca(2+)/calmodulin (see CALM1; 114180) and phosphatidylinositol
3-phosphate in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Yang and Li (2007) concluded
that RGS10 is a key regulator of Ca(2+) current oscillations during
osteoclast differentiation.

602644	TITLE *602644 TETRASPANIN 4; TSPAN4
;;TRANSMEMBRANE 4 SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 7; TM4SF7;;
TETRASPAN;;
NOVEL ANTIGEN 2; NAG2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TSPAN4 belongs to the large family of tetraspanins, so named because
they contain 4 transmembrane domains. Tetraspanins are frequently
expressed at the cell surface in association with each other and with
other molecules, such as integrins (see ITGB1; 135630), and they
function to regulate cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and
differentiation (summary by Todd et al., 1998).

CLONING

Tachibana et al. (1997) generated monoclonal antibodies against proteins
that coimmunoprecipitated with CD81 (TAPA1; 186845) from a human breast
cancer cell line. Two antibodies recognized a 28- to 35-kD protein,
which Tachibana et al. (1997) named NAG2 for 'novel antigen-2.' Using
the antibodies to screen a cDNA expression library derived from the
breast cancer cell line, the authors cloned cDNAs encoding NAG2. The
predicted 238-amino acid NAG2 protein contains 4 hydrophobic domains and
shows homology to transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF) proteins. Northern
blot analysis detected a 1.5-kb NAG2 mRNA, and together with flow
cytometry and immunohistochemistry, showed that NAG2 was expressed in
multiple tissues but was absent in brain, lymphoid cells, and platelets.
Immunofluorescence analysis showed that NAG2 colocalized with CD81 on
the cell surface. Tachibana et al. (1997) identified mouse ESTs encoding
the mouse homolog of NAG2. The human and mouse NAG2 proteins have 95%
amino acid identity.

By searching an EST database for sequences containing a tetraspanin
consensus sequence, Todd et al. (1998) identified human TSPAN4. The
deduced 238-amino acid protein contains 4 transmembrane domains and
other features characteristic of tetraspanins, including conservation of
charged residues in or near the transmembrane domains, similar to ion
channels, and of 4 cysteines in the second extracellular domain.
Northern blot analysis detected highest TSPAN4 expression in heart and
placenta. EST database analysis suggested that TSPAN4 is also expressed
in brain, melanocytes, pancreas, and fetal liver/spleen, in addition to
pregnant uterus and adult and fetal heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Tachibana et al. (1997) found that NAG2 coimmunoprecipitated with
integrins and other TM4SF members, indicating that NAG2 is present in
TM4SF-TM4SF and TM4SF-integrin complexes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the TSPAN4 gene to chromosome 11p15.5 based on an
alignment of the TSPAN4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF022813) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION Voltage-gated potassium channels, which constitute an evolutionarily
related superfamily, play an essential role in controlling cellular
excitability in the nervous system by regulating a variety of neuronal
properties, such as interspike membrane potential, action potential
waveform, and firing frequency.

By EST database searching, Occhiodoro et al. (1998) identified an EST
isolated from an adult brain cDNA library that showed significant
homology to the rat ether-a-go-go (eag) voltage-gated potassium channel
(see KCNH1; 603305) and to a human cDNA clone mapping to chromosome 14
(TMAP WI-6411). Sequencing of the clone indicated that the deduced
protein, designated KCNH5, shares 58% sequence identity with KCNH1 over
a total overlap of 457 amino acids. RT-PCR showed that KCNH5 is not
expressed in differentiating myoblasts. Northern blot analysis detected
expression of an approximately 11-kb transcript in adult brain tissue
only.

;;RELATED TO THE N TERMINUS OF TRE; RNTRE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing cDNAs randomly selected from a cDNA library derived from
the human immature myeloid cell line KG-1, Nomura et al. (1994) isolated
a cDNA encoding a protein they designated KIAA0019. Matoskova et al.
(1996) identified a cDNA encoding KIAA0019 by searching for cDNAs
encoding proteins that bind to the SH3 domain of EPS8 (600206). Because
the 828-amino acid protein encoded by this cDNA shows homology to the
N-terminal region of the TRE oncogene (see 604334), the authors
designated it RNTRE, for 'related to the N terminus of TRE.' RNTRE was
shown to be ubiquitously expressed. The regional homology between RNTRE
and TRE, which is limited to their N-terminal portion, prompted
Matoskova et al. (1996) to investigate the origin of the TRE oncogene
transcriptional unit. They showed that TRE is the fusion product of a
5-prime genetic element homologous to RNTRE and a 3-prime element
encoding a deubiquitinating enzyme. Moreover, they identified within the
N terminus of RNTRE and TRE a TRE homology (TRH) domain, which is
conserved within several proteins from yeast to mammal and has
protein-binding properties in vitro.

GENE FUNCTION

Matoskova et al. (1996) demonstrated that the product of the RNTRE gene
is a 97- to 100-kD protein that stably associates in vivo and in vitro
with EPS8 via the SH3 domain of the latter. In vitro, RNTRE displayed
remarkable preference for binding to the SH3 domain of EPS8, compared
with 8 other SH3s. A C-terminal truncated mutant of RNTRE was able to
confer proliferative advantage and reduced serum requirement to NIH 3T3
fibroblasts, suggesting a role for RNTRE in cell proliferation.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; 131550) signaling involves small
GTPases of the Rho family, and EGFR trafficking involves small GTPases
of the Rab family. Lanzetti et al. (2000) reported that the EPS8 protein
connects these signaling pathways. EPS8 is a substrate of EGFR that is
held in a complex with SOS1 (182530) by the adaptor protein E3B1
(603050), thereby mediating activation of RAC (602048). Through its SH3
domain, EPS8 interacts with RNTRE. Lanzetti et al. (2000) showed that
RNTRE is a RAB5 (179512) GTPase-activating protein (GAP) whose activity
is regulated by EGFR. By entering in a complex with EPS8, RNTRE acts on
RAB5 and inhibits internalization of the EGFR. Furthermore, RNTRE
diverts EPS8 from its RAC-activating function, resulting in the
attenuation of RAC signaling. Thus, depending on its state of
association with E3B1 or RNTRE, EPS8 participates in both EGFR signaling
through RAC and EGFR trafficking through RAB5. Lanzetti et al. (2000)
showed that 2 arginine residues (arg106 and arg150 of RNTRE) are highly
conserved in TRH domains. In addition, an aspartate residue (asp147 of
RNTRE) is invariant. Mutations of any of these residues to alanine
resulted in proteins that were unable to display GAP activity on RAB5.

Lanzetti et al. (2004) demonstrated that RAB5 is indispensable for a
form of receptor tyrosine kinase-induced actin remodeling called
circular ruffling. Three independent signals, originating from RAB5,
phosphatidylinositol-3-hydroxykinase, and RAC (see 602048),
respectively, are simultaneously required for the induction of circular
ruffles. RAB5 signals to the actin cytoskeleton through RNTRE, a
RAB5-specific GTPase-activating protein (GAP). Lanzetti et al. (2004)
demonstrated that RNTRE has the dual function of RAB5-GAP and RAB5
effector. They also showed that RNTRE is critical for macropinocytosis,
a process connected to the formation of circular ruffles. Finally, RNTRE
interacts with both F-actin and actinin-4 (604638), an F-actin bundling
protein. Lanzetti et al. (2004) proposed that RNTRE establishes a
3-pronged connection with RAB5, F-actin, and actinin-4. This may aid
crosslinking of actin fibers into actin networks at the plasma membrane.
Lanzetti et al. (2004) concluded that they showed that RAB5 is a
signaling GTPase and elucidated the major molecular elements of its
downstream pathway.

MAPPING

Matoskova et al. (1996) mapped RNTRE to 10p13, a region known to be
involved in translocations in various leukemias. In addition, a 10p13
monosomy syndrome, characterized by developmental alternations, has been
reported.

;;POTASSIUM CHANNEL, INWARDLY RECTIFYING, BIR SUBUNIT;;
BETA-CELL INWARD RECTIFIER SUBUNIT; BIR;;
INWARDLY RECTIFYING POTASSIUM CHANNEL Kir6.2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels couple cell metabolism to membrane
excitability in various cell types, including pancreatic beta cells,
neurons, endocrine cells, and muscle cells. The archetypal KATP channel
is an octameric complex of KCNJ11 subunits and either SUR1 (ABCC8;
600509) subunits in pancreatic beta cells and many neurons or SUR2
(ABCC9; 601439) subunits in muscle. Four KCNJ11 subunits form the
channel pore, and each is associated with a SUR subunit that contributes
to regulation of channel gating (summary by Girard et al., 2009).

CLONING

Inagaki et al. (1995) cloned a member of the inwardly rectifying
potassium channel family, which they called BIR, for 'beta-cell inward
rectifier,' or Kir6.2, in the nomenclature of Chandy and Gutman (1993).
The channel was expressed in large amounts in rat pancreatic islets and
glucose-responsive insulin-secreting cell lines. The sequence showed a
single open reading frame encoding a 390-amino acid protein with 2
putative transmembrane segments. The mouse homolog also had a single
open reading frame encoding a 390-amino acid protein with 96% amino acid
identity with human BIR.

GENE STRUCTURE

Inagaki et al. (1995) determined that KCNJ11, the gene encoding human
BIR, is intronless in the protein-coding region. Several other genes
encoding inward rectifiers lack introns.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Inagaki et al. (1995) mapped the
BIR gene to 11p15.1. The sequence obtained from 1 lambda clone at the
3-prime end of the SUR gene (ABCC8; 600509) matched a part of the gene
encoding BIR; with a sense primer near the 3-prime end of the SUR gene
and an antisense primer near the 5-prime end of the BIR gene they
PCR-amplified an approximately 4.5-kb fragment. Thus, the authors
determined that the 2 genes are clustered at 11p15.1, with the BIR gene
immediately 3-prime of the SUR gene. The SUR gene had previously been
mapped to 11p15.1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (Thomas et al.,
1995).

GENE FUNCTION

In pancreatic beta cells, ATP-potassium channels are crucial for the
regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion and are the target for
the sulfonylureas, oral hypoglycemic agents widely used in the treatment
of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM; 125853), and for
diazoxide, a potassium channel opener. The sulfonylurea receptor (SUR)
is a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily with multiple
transmembrane-spanning domains and 2 potential nucleotide-binding folds.
Inagaki et al. (1995) demonstrated that coexpression of BIR with SUR
reconstituted an inwardly rectifying potassium conductance of 76
picosiemens that was sensitive to ATP and was inhibited by sulfonylureas
and activated by diazoxide. The data indicated to the authors that these
pancreatic beta-cell potassium channels are a complex composed of at
least 2 subunits: BIR and SUR.

Inagaki et al. (1996) cloned rat SUR2 (601439) and found that
coexpression of SUR2 and BIR in COS-1 cells reconstituted the properties
of K(ATP) channels described in cardiac and skeletal muscle. However,
they found that the SUR2/BIR channel is less sensitive than the SUR/BIR
channel both to ATP and to the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, and is
activated by the cardiac K(ATP) channel openers cromakalim and pinacidil
but not by diazoxide. The affinity of SUR2 for sulfonylureas is 500
times lower than that of SUR.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia

Thomas et al. (1996) screened genomic DNA from members of 15 families
with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HHF2; 601820) for mutations in the
KCNJ11 gene. In a male infant with profound hypoglycemia, born of
consanguineous Iranian parents, Thomas et al. (1996) identified
homozygosity for a 649T-C mutation (600937.0001). His parents were
heterozygous for the mutation.

Using SSCP and nucleotide sequence analysis, Nestorowicz et al. (1997)
screened 78 patients with hyperinsulinism for mutations in the KCNJ11
gene and identified homozygosity for a nonsense mutation (600937.0009)
in 1 patient.

De Lonlay et al. (1997) showed that in cases of the focal form, but not
those of the diffuse form, of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia there was
specific loss of maternal alleles of the imprinted chromosome region
11p15 in cells of the hyperplastic area of the pancreas but not in
normal pancreatic cells. This somatic event was consistent with a
proliferative monoclonal lesion. It involves disruption of the balance
between monoallelic expression of several maternally and paternally
expressed genes. Thus, they provided the first molecular explanation for
the heterogeneity of sporadic forms of PHHI such that it is possible to
perform only partial pancreatectomy, limited to the focal somatic
lesion, so as to avoid iatrogenic diabetes in patients with focal
adenomatous hyperplasia. It is possible that in these cases of somatic
loss of maternal 11p15.1, there is reduction to homozygosity for a
recessive ABCC8 or KCNJ11 mutation on the paternal allele, since both
ABCC8 and KCNJ11 are located in the 11p15.1 region.

Tornovsky et al. (2004) screened 15 patients with neonatal
hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia for mutations in the ABCC8 and KCNJ11
genes and identified 12 mutations in 11 patients. Homozygosity for a
mutation in the promoter (600937.0010) and in exon 1 (600937.0011) of
the KCNJ11 gene were identified in an Israeli Bedouin and an Arab
patient, respectively.

Henwood et al. (2005) measured acute insulin responses (AIRs) to
calcium, leucine, glucose, and tolbutamide in 22 infants with recessive
ABCC8 or KCNJ11 mutations (see, e.g., 600937.0019), 8 of whom had
diffuse hyperinsulinism and 14 of whom had focal hyperinsulinism. Of the
24 total mutations, 7 showed evidence of residual K(ATP) channel
function: 2 of the patients with partial defects were homozygous and 4
heterozygous for amino acid substitutions or insertions, and 1 was a
compound heterozygote for 2 premature stop codons.

Lin et al. (2008) investigated the mechanisms by which
hyperinsulinism-associated mutations of arg301 (R301) in KCNJ11 (e.g.,
R301H; 600937.0019) lead to channel dysfunction. They found that R301
mutations in rat Kcnj11 resulted in reduced channel expression at the
cell surface in transfected cells and caused rapid, spontaneous current
decay, or inactivation. Mutagenesis studies indicated that R301 is near
the Kcnj11 subunit-subunit interface and likely stabilizes channel
activity. To evaluate the effects of channel inactivation on beta cell
function, Lin et al. (2008) expressed an alternative R301 mutation,
R301A, which induces channel inactivation without affecting channel
surface expression, in a rat insulinoma cell line. Expression of Kcnj11
with R301A resulted in more depolarized membrane potential and elevated
insulin secretion at basal glucose concentration compared with cells
expressing wildtype channels. Lin et al. (2008) concluded that mutations
at R301 may cause channel inactivation by disrupting subunit-subunit
interactions, and that this gating defect is sufficient to cause loss of
channel function and hyperinsulinism.

Pinney et al. (2008) identified 14 different dominantly inherited K(ATP)
channel mutations in 16 unrelated families, 13 with mutations in the
ABCC8 gene (see, e.g., 600509.0011) and 3 with mutations in the KCNJ11
gene (see, e.g., 600937.0020). Unlike recessive mutations, dominantly
inherited K(ATP) mutant subunits trafficked normally to the plasma
membrane when expressed in simian kidney cells; dominant mutations also
resulted in different channel-gating defects, with dominant ABCC8
mutations diminishing channel responses to magnesium adenosine
diphosphate or diazoxide and dominant KCNJ11 mutations impairing channel
opening even in the absence of nucleotides. Pinney et al. (2008)
concluded that there are distinctive features of dominant K(ATP)
hyperinsulinism compared to the more common and more severe recessive
form, including retention of normal subunit trafficking, impaired
channel activity, and a milder hypoglycemia phenotype that may escape
detection in infancy and is often responsive to diazoxide medical
therapy.

Taneja et al. (2009) reported that the Kir6.2 channel contains a
diacidic ER exit signal DXE at codons 280 to 282, which promotes
concentration of the channel into COPII-enriched ER exit sites prior to
ER export via a process that requires Sar1-GTPase (607690). They
identified an E282K mutation (600937.0022) in a Swedish patient with
HHF2 with focal adenomatous hyperplasia. The E282K mutation abrogated
the ER exit signal and prevented ER export and surface expression of the
channel. When coexpressed, the E282K-mutant subunit was able to
associate with the wildtype Kir6.2 and form functional channels, and
unlike most mutations did not cause protein misfolding. Since in focal
congenital hyperinsulinism, the maternal chromosome containing the
K(ATP) channel genes is lost, beta-cells of the patient lacked wildtype
Kir6.2 to rescue the mutant Kir6.2 subunit expressed from the paternal
chromosome. The resultant absence of functional KATP channels leads to
insulin hypersecretion. Taneja et al. (2009) concluded that surface
expression of K(ATP) channels is critically dependent on the
Sar1-GTPase-dependent ER exit mechanism, and abrogation of the diacidic
ER exit signal leads to congenital hyperinsulinism.

- Diabetes Mellitus Type II

Hani et al. (1998) identified an association between an E23K variant in
the KCNJ11 gene (600937.0014) and type II diabetes mellitus (125853) in
French families.

Hansen et al. (2005) studied the effects of the E23K polymorphism and a
PPARG P12A polymorphism (601487.0002) on the risk of type II diabetes
and found that the polymorphisms may act in an additive manner to
increase the risk of type II diabetes.

- Permanent Neonatal Diabetes

Because ATP-sensitive potassium channels mediate glucose-stimulated
insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cells, Gloyn et al. (2004)
hypothesized that activating mutations in the KCNJ11 gene might cause
neonatal diabetes. They studied 29 patients with permanent neonatal
diabetes (PNDM; 606176) characterized by ketoacidosis or marked
hyperglycemia who were treated with insulin. The patients did not
secrete insulin in response to glucose or glucagon but did secrete
insulin in response to tolbutamide. Four of the patients also had severe
developmental delay and muscle weakness; 3 of them also had epilepsy and
mild dysmorphic features (DEND; see 606176). Gloyn et al. (2004)
sequenced the KCNJ11 gene in all 29 patients and identified 6 novel,
heterozygous missense mutations in 10. In 4 of the 10 families, the
mutation was an arg201-to-his (R201H) substitution (600937.0002). In 2
patients, the diabetes was familial. In 8 patients, the diabetes arose
from a spontaneous mutation (see, e.g., V59M; 600937.0003). When the
most common mutation, R201H, was coexpressed with SUR in Xenopus
oocytes, the ability of ATP to block mutant ATP-sensitive potassium
channels was greatly reduced. Thus, whereas inactivating mutations of
KCNJ11 lead to uncontrolled insulin secretion and congenital
hyperinsulinism, activating mutations cause neonatal diabetes. Gloyn et
al. (2004) concluded that heterozygous activating mutations of the
KCNJ11 gene are a common cause (approximately 34%) of permanent neonatal
diabetes. In a high proportion (80%) of subjects studied in their
series, the mutation occurred de novo.

Gloyn et al. (2005) identified 3 novel heterozygous mutations (see,
e.g., 600937.0017-600937.0018) in 3 of 11 probands with clinically
defined TNDM who did not have chromosome 6q24 abnormalities. The
mutations cosegregated with diabetes in 2 families and were not found in
100 controls. All 3 probands had insulin-treated diabetes diagnosed in
the first 4 months of life and went into remission by 7 to 17 months of
age. In transformed Xenopus oocytes, all 3 heterozygous mutations
resulted in a reduction in sensitivity to ATP when compared with
wildtype; however, the effect was less than that of PNDM-associated
mutations. Gloyn et al. (2005) concluded that mutations in KCNJ11 can
cause both remitting and permanent diabetes, suggesting that a fixed ion
channel abnormality may result in a fluctuating glycemic phenotype.

Yorifuji et al. (2005) found a missense mutation in the KCNJ11 gene
(600937.0012) in a 4-generation family with dominantly inherited
diabetes mellitus observed in 3 generations (see 610582). The onset and
severity of the diabetes were variable: transient neonatal diabetes,
childhood-onset diabetes, gestational diabetes, or adult-onset diabetes.

In a 20-year-old woman who had transient neonatal diabetes mellitus that
recurred at age 7 years, Colombo et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity
for a de novo R201H mutation in the KCNJ11 gene.

Proks et al. (2005) studied the MgATP sensitivity of KCNJ11-mutant
K(ATP) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In contrast to wildtype
channels, Mg(2+) dramatically reduced the ATP sensitivity of
heterozygous R201C (600937.0004), R201H, V59M, and V59G (600937.0005)
channels. This effect was predominantly mediated via the
nucleotide-binding domains of SUR1 (ABCC8; 600509) and resulted from an
enhanced stimulatory action of MgATP. Proks et al. (2005) concluded that
KCNJ11 mutations increase the current magnitude of heterozygous K(ATP)
channels by increasing MgATP activation and by decreasing ATP
inhibition. The fraction of unblocked K(ATP) current at physiologic
MgATP concentrations correlated with the severity of the clinical
phenotype.

- Association with Impaired Exercise Stress Response

Reyes et al. (2009) found that the E23K polymorphism was overrepresented
in individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy (see 115200) and congestive
heart failure (CHF) compared to controls, and that the KK genotype was
associated with abnormal cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing. Reyes
et al. (2009) suggested that E23K might represent a biomarker for
impaired stress performance.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

To determine why some mutations in the KCNJ11 gene cause PNDM in
isolation whereas others cause PNDM associated with marked developmental
delay, muscle weakness, and epilepsy, Proks et al. (2004) expressed
wildtype or mutant Kir6.2/sulfonylurea receptor-1 channels in Xenopus
oocytes. All of the mutations investigated (R201C, Q52R, and V59G)
increased resting whole-cell K(ATP) currents by reducing channel
inhibition by ATP, but in the simulated heterozygous state, the mutation
causing PNDM alone (R201C) produced smaller K(ATP) currents and less
change in ATP sensitivity than mutations associated with severe disease
(Q52R and V59G). These findings suggested that increased K(ATP) currents
hyperpolarize pancreatic beta cells and impair insulin secretion,
whereas larger K(ATP) currents are required to influence extra
pancreatic cell function. Proks et al. (2004) also found that mutations
causing PNDM alone impaired ATP sensitivity directly (at the binding
site), whereas those associated with severe disease acted indirectly by
biasing the channel conformation toward the open state. The effect of
the mutation on ATP sensitivity in the heterozygous state reflected the
different contributions of a single subunit in the Kir6.2 tetramer to
ATP inhibition and to the energy of the open state. The results showed
that mutations in the slide helix of Kir6.2 (V59G) influence the channel
kinetics, providing evidence that this domain is involved in Kir channel
gating and suggesting that the efficacy of sulfonylurea therapy in PNDM
may vary with genotype.

Massa et al. (2005) screened the KCNJ11 gene in 18 Italian patients with
what they termed 'permanent diabetes mellitus of infancy' (PDMI),
including 12 patients with onset within 3 months after birth and 6 with
onset between 3 months to 1 year of age. Five different heterozygous
mutations were identified in 8 patients with diabetes diagnosed between
day 3 and day 182. Two of these mutations were novel. Four of the 8
patients also had motor and/or developmental delay. Massa et al. (2005)
concluded that KCNJ11 mutations are a common cause of PNDM either in
isolation or associated with developmental delay.

The beta-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel is a key component of
stimulus-secretion coupling in the pancreatic beta cell. The channel
couples metabolism to membrane electrical events, bringing about insulin
secretion. Given the critical role of this channel in glucose
homeostasis, it is not surprising that mutations in the genes encoding
the 2 essential subunits of the channel, KCNJ11 and ABCC8, can result in
either hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Gloyn et al. (2006) reviewed the
loss-of-function mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8, which can cause
oversecretion of insulin and result in hyperinsulinemia of infancy. They
reviewed the management of patients in whom mutations in these genes are
found.

From a study of 49 patients with activating Kir6.2 mutations,
Slingerland and Hattersley (2006) concluded that these mutations cause a
severe reduction in fetal insulin secretion and hence fetal growth but
that this is independent of mutation severity. Postnatal catch-up
required insulin treatment but was complete, except in those with
epilepsy.

ANIMAL MODEL

Miki et al. (1997) generated transgenic mice expressing a
dominant-negative mutation within the conserved gly-tyr-gly motif of the
putative K(+)-permeable domain of Kcnj11. The gene was inserted
downstream of the human insulin promoter region for selective expression
in pancreatic beta cells. Transgenic mice developed hypoglycemia with
hyperinsulinemia as neonates and hyperglycemia with hypoinsulinemia and
decreased beta cell numbers as adults. Kcnj11 function was impaired in
the beta cells of transgenic mice with hyperglycemia, and both resting
membrane potential and basal calcium concentrations were significantly
elevated in transgenic mice. Miki et al. (1997) also observed a high
frequency of apoptotic beta cells prior to the development of
hyperglycemia, suggesting a role for Kcnj11 in cell survival as well as
in regulating insulin secretion.

Koster et al. (2000) generated transgenic mice expressing pancreatic
beta-cell K(ATP) channels with reduced ATP sensitivity. They used
transgenes with truncation of the N-terminal 30 amino acids of the
Kir6.2 subunit, and a double mutant with the 30-amino acid truncation
and a lys185-to-gln mutation. These transgenes were fused at the C
terminus with the green fluorescent protein to allow for detection under
ultraviolet illumination. Transgenic animals developed severe
hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, and ketoacidosis within 2 days, and
typically died within 5 days. Nevertheless, islet morphology, insulin
localization, and alpha- and beta-cell distributions were normal (before
day 3), pointing to reduced insulin secretion as causal. The data
indicated that normal K(ATP) channel activity is critical for
maintenance of euglycemia and that overactivity can cause diabetes by
inhibiting insulin secretion.

In mice with a conditional deletion of Hnf4a (600281) in pancreatic beta
cells, Gupta et al. (2005) observed hyperinsulinemia in fasted and fed
animals but also impaired glucose tolerance. Islet perfusion and
calcium-imaging studies showed abnormal beta cell responses to
stimulation by glucose and sulfonylureas, explainable in part by a 60%
reduction in expression of the potassium channel subunit Kir6.2.
Cotransfection assays revealed that the Kir6.2 gene is a transcriptional
target of HNF4A. Gupta et al. (2005) concluded that HNF4A is required in
the pancreatic beta cell for regulation of the pathway of insulin
secretion dependent on the ATP-dependent potassium channel.

ATP-sensitive potassium channels are activated by various metabolic
stresses, including hypoxia. The substantia nigra pars reticulata, the
area with the highest expression of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in
the brain, plays a pivotal role in the control of seizures. Yamada et
al. (2001) studied mutant mice lacking the Kir6.2 subunit of
ATP-sensitive potassium channels and found that they were susceptible to
generalized seizures after brief hypoxia. In normal mice, the substantia
nigra pars reticulata neuron activity was inactivated during hypoxia by
the opening of the postsynaptic ATP-sensitive potassium channels,
whereas in knockout mice, the activity of these neurons was enhanced.
ATP-sensitive potassium channels exert a depressant effect on substantia
nigra pars reticulata neuronal activity during hypoxia and may be
involved in the nigral protection mechanism against generalized
seizures.

Girard et al. (2009) created a mouse strain conditionally expressing the
human Kir6.2 V59M mutation (600937.0003) specifically in pancreatic beta
cells. Kir6.2(V59M) mRNA was expressed at a level comparable to that of
endogenous wildtype Kir6.2 mRNA. Mutant mice (beta-V59M mice) developed
severe diabetes soon after birth, and by 5 weeks of age, blood glucose
levels were markedly increased and insulin was undetectable. Isolated
beta-V59M islets displayed a reduced percentage of beta cells, abnormal
morphology, abnormal calcium oscillations, lower insulin content, and
decreased expression of Kir6.2, Sur1, and insulin mRNA. Beta-V59M islets
secreted substantially less insulin and showed a smaller increase in
intracellular calcium in response to glucose than wildtype islets, which
was due to reduced sensitivity of Kir6.2(V69M) channels to ATP or
glucose. Current and secretion events downstream of channel closure
remained intact.

By using mice carrying the human V59M mutation in Kir6.2 (600937.0003)
targeted to either muscle or nerve, Clark et al. (2010) showed that
analogous motor impairments originate in the central nervous system
rather than in muscle or peripheral nerves. Clark et al. (2010) also
identified locomotor hyperactivity as a feature of K(ATP) channel
overactivity. Clark et al. (2010) concluded that their finding suggested
that drugs targeted against neuronal, rather than muscle, K(ATP)
channels are needed to treat the motor deficits and that such drugs
require high blood-brain barrier permeability.

In 4 unrelated patients with permanent neonatal diabetes (606176), Gloyn
et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous arg201-to-his (R201H) mutation
in the KCNJ11 gene. The arg201 residue lies close to the ATP-binding
site and was implicated in ATP sensitivity (Ribalet et al., 2003). In 1
family reported by Gloyn et al. (2004), 2 brothers and the father were
affected. Diabetes in the brothers was diagnosed under the age of 3 or 4
weeks, and in the father at the age of 12 weeks. The father was age 46
years at the time of report. In another family, mother and son were
affected. The diagnosis had been made at birth in the son and at age 6
weeks in the mother, who was 36 years old at the time of report. None of
the patients with the R201H mutation had muscle weakness, neurologic
abnormalities, or dysmorphic features. The arginine residue at position
201 of Kir6.2 lies close to the ATP-binding site and was previously
implicated in ATP sensing.

By functional expression studies in Xenopus oocytes, Proks et al. (2004)
found that mutations at the arg201 residue (see also R201C; 600937.0004)
caused a decrease in ATP sensitivity by altering the ATP-binding site.
However, the decreased sensitivity found in cells with a mutation at
arg201 was not as severe as that found in cells with a mutation at val59
(see V59M, 600937.0003 and V59G, 600937.0005).

Gloyn et al. (2006) reported 2 unrelated infants with PNDM and the R201H
mutation. The male infant also had dysmorphic facial features and
neurologic involvement, including seizures, developmental delay, and
axial hypotonia. In contrast, the other infant did not have neurologic
involvement, and her mother, who also carried the mutation, had severe
diabetes mellitus without neurologic involvement. The phenotypic
variability suggested that other modifying factors likely play a role.

In a 20-year-old woman with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM3;
610582) in whom diabetes remitted at age 29 months and recurred at age 7
years, Colombo et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for a de novo
602G-A (R201H) mutation in the KCNJ11 gene.

In 2 unrelated males with permanent neonatal diabetes (606176), Gloyn et
al. (2004) found heterozygosity for a val59-to-met (V59M) mutation in
the KCNJ11 gene. One of the patients had muscle weakness, and mildly
delayed motor and mental development.

Proks et al. (2004) noted that 2 mutations in the same residue of
Kir6.2, V59M and V59G (600937.0005), are associated with a more severe
form of PNDM that may be accompanied by developmental delay, muscle
weakness, and epilepsy, compared to PNDM caused by the mutations R201H
(600937.0002) and R201C (600937.0004). They found that residue val59
lies some distance from the ATP-binding site, within the N-terminal
region of the protein; moreover, val59 lies within the 'slide helix,' a
domain postulated to be involved in the opening and closing (gating) of
Kir channels. Functional expression studies in Xenopus oocytes indicated
that the V59M and V59G mutations decreased ATP sensitivity indirectly by
favoring the open conformation of the channel.

Massa et al. (2005) found the V59M mutation in 4 unrelated Italian
patients with PNDM. Two of the patients had motor and mental
developmental delay. One of the patients was diagnosed at over 6 months
of age (182 days). Massa et al. (2005) suggested that the designation
'permanent diabetes mellitus of infancy' (PDMI) replace 'permanent
neonatal diabetes mellitus.'

Gloyn et al. (2006) reported a patient with the V59M mutation who had
PNDM and neurologic features, including mild motor developmental delay
and axial hypotonia.

In a patient with PNDM (606176), Gloyn et al. (2004) identified a
heterozygous arg201-to-cys (R201C) mutation in the Kir6.2 gene. The
patient was diagnosed at 4 weeks of age and had no additional neurologic
or dysmorphic features. The arg201 residue lies close to the ATP-binding
site and was implicated in ATP sensitivity (Ribalet et al., 2003).

Proks et al. (2004) stated that the 2 mutations in residue arg201, R201H
(600937.0002) and R201C, which lie in the ATP-binding site of Kir6.2,
cause milder PNDM disease without neurologic features; however, Massa et
al. (2005) identified the R201C mutation in a patient with PNDM who also
had muscle weakness and delayed motor development.

Gloyn et al. (2004) described a family in which 2 affected paternal
half-sibs were heterozygous for the R201C mutation. Direct sequencing of
leukocyte DNA showed that their clinically unaffected mothers and father
were genotypically normal. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the
father's leukocyte DNA detected no trace of mutant DNA. These results
were consistent with the father being mosaic for the mutation, which was
restricted to his germline. Gloyn et al. (2004) concluded that the high
percentage of permanent neonatal diabetes cases due to de novo KCNJ11
mutations (Gloyn et al., 2004) suggests that germline mosaicism may be
common.

muscle weakness, marked motor and mental developmental delay, myoclonic

homozygosity for a 39C-A transversion in the KCNJ11 gene, resulting in a
tyr12-to-ter (Y12X) substitution. The mutation is predicted to produce a
truncated Kir6.2 polypeptide lacking the putative K+ ion-selective pore
region as well as those domains proposed to confer the gating and inward
rectification properties of the molecule. In vitro studies in
transfected COS-1 cells confirmed the deleterious effect of the mutation
on channel activity. The authors noted that this patient was clinically

In affected members of a 4-generation Japanese family with dominantly
inherited diabetes mellitus observed in 3 generations, Yorifuji et al.
(2005) detected a T-to-C transition at nucleotide 124 of the KCNJ11 gene
that gave rise to a cys42-to-arg amino acid substitution (C24R). The
proband had transient neonatal diabetes (TNDM3; 610582), and his
paternal grandfather had childhood diabetes. The others had adult-onset
diabetes without autoantibodies or insulin resistance. Patch-clamp
experiments using the mutated KCNJ11 showed that the mutation causes
increased spontaneous open probability and reduced ATP sensitivity. The
effect, however, was partially compensated by the reduction of
functional ATP-sensitive potassium channel expression at the cell
surface, which could account for the milder phenotype of the patients.
The authors concluded that these results broadened the spectrum of
diabetes phenotypes caused by mutations of KCNJ11 and suggested that
mutations in this gene should be taken into consideration for not only
permanent neonatal diabetes but also other forms of diabetes with milder
phenotypes and later onset.

(H259R). The patient presented with macrosomia at birth and severe
hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Despite medical treatment, the newborn
continued to suffer from severe hypoglycemic episodes, and at 4 months
of age subtotal pancreatectomy was performed. Coexpression of KCNJ11
H259R with ABCC8 (600509) in HEK293T cells completely abolished K(ATP)
currents in electrophysiologic recordings. Double immunofluorescence
staining revealed that mutant KCNJ11 was partly retained in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causing decreased surface expression as
observed with total internal reflection fluorescence. Mutation of an

Hani et al. (1998) identified a glu23-to-lys (E23K) amino acid
substitution in the KCNJ11 gene by molecular screening using SSCP and
direct sequencing in 72 French Caucasian type II diabetic families. They
genotyped this variant in French cohorts of 191 unrelated type II
diabetic probands and 119 normoglycemic control subjects and performed
association studies. Homozygosity for lys23 (KK) was more frequent in
type II diabetic than in control subjects (27 vs 14%; p = 0.015).
Analyses in a recessive model (KK vs EK/EE) showed a stronger
association of the K allele with diabetes. In a metaanalysis of their
data for the E23K variant and data obtained from 3 other Caucasian
groups, Hani et al. (1998) found the E23K variant to be significantly
associated with type II diabetes.

Hansen et al. (2005) investigated the separate and combined effects of
the PPARG pro12-to-ala (P12A; 601487.0002) and the KCNJ11 E23K
polymorphisms on risk of type II diabetes. The combined analysis
involved 1,164 type II diabetic patients and 4,733 middle-aged,
glucose-tolerant subjects. In the separate analyses, the K allele of
KCNJ11 E23K associated with type II diabetes (odds ratio, 1.19; P =
0.0002), whereas PPARG P12A showed no significant association with type
2 diabetes. The combined analysis indicated that the 2 polymorphisms
acted in an additive manner to increase the risk of type II diabetes,
and the authors found no evidence for a synergistic interaction between
them. Together, the 2 polymorphisms conferred a population-attributable
risk for type II diabetes of 28%. The authors concluded that their
results showed no evidence of a synergistic interaction between the
KCNJ11 E23K and PPARG P12A polymorphisms, but indicated that they may
act in an additive manner to increase the risk of type II diabetes.

Laukkanen et al. (2004) found an additive effect of a high risk ABCC8
(600509) haplotype, composed of a silent polymorphism (AGG-AGA; arg1273
to arg) and 3 promoter polymorphisms, and the 23K allele of the KCNJ11
gene.

In genomewide association studies of type 2 diabetes involving genotype
data from a variety of international consortia, the Diabetes Genetics
Initiative of Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Lund University, and
Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (2007), Zeggini et al.
(2007), and Scott et al. (2007) confirmed association of the E23K
polymorphism (dbSNP rs5219) with diabetes susceptibility. Although this
association was not strongly observed in any single scan, all-data
metaanalyses resulted in genomewide significant association (OR = 1.14,
P = 6.7 x 10(-11)).

Association with Impaired Exercise Stress Response

Reyes et al. (2009) found that the E23K polymorphism was overrepresented
in 115 individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy (see 115200) and
congestive heart failure (CHF) compared to 2,031 community-based
controls (p less than 0.001). In addition, the KK genotype, which was
present in 18% of the CHF patients, was associated with abnormal
cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing: despite similar baseline heart
rates among genotype subgroups, individuals with the KK genotype had a
significantly reduced heart rate increase at matched workload, at 75% of
maximum oxygen consumption, and at peak VO(2), compared to those with
the EE or EK genotypes. Noting that the glu23 residue is located within
the functionally relevant intracellular slide helix region, Reyes et al.
(2009) suggested that E23K might represent a biomarker for impaired
stress performance.

sequencing revealed a heterozygous gly53-to-asp (G53D) mutation in the
KCNJ11 gene. Treatment was progressively transferred from insulin to the
inhibitory sulfonylureas (SUs) gliclazide and finally to glibenclamide.
The patient demonstrated improved glycemic control and motor
coordination with SU treatment, with glibenclamide more effective than
gliclazide. Reconstituted G53D channels exhibited reduced ATP
sensitivity, which was predicted to suppress electrical activity in
vivo. G53D channels coexpressed with the pancreatic and neuronal isoform
of the sulfonylurea receptor SUR1 (600509) exhibited high-affinity block
by gliclazide but were insensitive to block when coexpressed with the
skeletal muscle isoform SUR2A (601439). Koster et al. (2008) concluded
that SUs can resolve motor dysfunction in an adult with intermediate
DEND and that this improvement is due to inhibition of the neuronal but
not skeletal muscle ATP-sensitive potassium channel.

the ER export and surface expression of the channel. Since in focal

mutations on the same haplotype (cis), phe60 to tyr (F60Y) and val64 to
leu (V64L), in the slide helix of Kir6.2 (KCNJ11). Functional analysis
revealed that the F60Y mutation increased the intrinsic channel open
probability, thereby indirectly producing a marked decrease in channel
inhibition by ATP and an increase in whole-cell potassium-ATP currents.
When expressed alone, the V64L mutation caused a small reduction in
apparent ATP inhibition, by enhancing the ability of MgATP to stimulate
channel activity. The V64L mutation also ameliorated the deleterious
effects on the F60Y mutation when it was expressed on the same, but not
a different, subunit. The authors concluded that F60Y is the pathogenic
mutation and that interactions between slide helix residues may
influence KATP channel gating.

602360	TITLE *602360 L-ARGININE:GLYCINE AMIDINOTRANSFERASE; GATM
;;AGAT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Creatine and phosphocreatine play important roles in the energy
metabolism of muscle and nerve tissues. The enzyme L-arginine:glycine
amidinotransferase (AGAT; EC 2.1.4.1) catalyzes the transfer of a
guanido group from arginine to glycine, forming guanidinoacetic acid,
the immediate precursor of creatine. One of the major sites of creatine
biosynthesis is the kidney. Humm et al. (1994) isolated and sequenced
AGAT from pig kidney mitochondria. Sequence data from the pig AGAT
polypeptide allowed them to isolate cDNA clones encoding the human
enzyme from a kidney carcinoma cDNA library. The largest human cDNA
sequence encodes a 423-amino acid polypeptide including a 37-amino acid
signal sequence. The mature porcine and human proteins are 94% identical
to each other and 36% identical to bacterial L-arginine:inosamine
phosphate amidinotransferase. Humm et al. (1997) noted that
mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of AGAT are believed to derive from
the same gene by alternative splicing. They expressed human AGAT in E.
coli and identified its active-site cysteine residue (cys407).

GENE STRUCTURE

Item et al. (2001) stated that the AGAT genomic DNA is 16,858 bp long
and contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

Item et al. (2001) stated that the human AGAT gene is located on
chromosome 15q15.3

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 sisters with cerebral creatine deficiency syndrome-3 (CCDS3;
612718) reported by Bianchi et al. (2000), Item et al. (2001) identified
a homozygous trp149-to-ter mutation in the GATM gene (W149X;
602360.0001), resulting in undetectable cDNA, as investigated by RT-PCR,
as well as in undetectable AGAT activity, as investigated
radiochemically in cultivated skin fibroblasts and in virus-transformed
lymphoblasts of the patients. The parents were heterozygous for the
mutant allele, with intermediate residual AGAT activities. In an
affected male cousin of the sibs reported by Bianchi et al. (2000),
Battini et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for the same W149X
mutation.

In 2 sibs, born of unrelated Yemenite Jewish parents, with cerebral
creatine deficiency syndrome-3, Edvardson et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous truncating mutation in the GATM gene (602360.0002).

ANIMAL MODEL

Sandell et al. (2003) demonstrated in the mouse that Gatm, which is
expressed during development, is imprinted in the placenta and yolk sac,
but not in embryonic tissues. The Gatm gene maps to mouse chromosome 2
in a region that had not previously been shown to contain imprinted
genes. To determine whether Gatm is located in a cluster of imprinted
genes, Sandell et al. (2003) investigated the expression pattern of
genes located near Gatm: Duox1 (606758), Duox2 (606759), Slc28a2
(606208), Slc30a4 (602095), and a transcript corresponding to LOC214616
and found no evidence that any is imprinted in placenta. These data were
the first to link creatine metabolism with imprinting and the parental
'tug-of-war' for energy resources during development. Although many
imprinted genes are associated with differentially methylated CpG
islands, the Gatm gene resides in apparent isolation from other
imprinted genes and is associated with an unmethylated CpG island.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CEREBRAL CREATINE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME 3
GATM, TRP149TER

In 2 sisters with cerebral creatine deficiency syndrome-3 (CCDS3;
612718) reported by Bianchi et al. (2000), Item et al. (2001) identified
a homozygous 9297G-A transition, converting a tryptophan codon (TGG) to
a stop codon (TAG) at residue 149 (W149X) of the GATM gene.

In an affected cousin of the sibs reported by Bianchi et al. (2000),
Battini et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for the same W149X
mutation; his parents and 10 additional subjects in the pedigree were
heterozygous for the mutation.

.0002
CEREBRAL CREATINE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME 3
GATM, 1-BP INS, 1111A

In 2 sibs, born of unrelated Yemenite Jewish parents, with cerebral
creatine deficiency syndrome-3 (612718), Edvardson et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 1-bp insertion (1111insA) in the GATM gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination at codon 376. Each
unaffected parent was heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found
in 57 ethnic controls. Both patients showed delayed psychomotor
development in infancy with poor speech acquisition. Each also had
symptoms of a myopathy, with easy fatigability and predominantly
proximal muscle weakness and atrophy. Brain MRS showed decreased
creatine, and urine guanidinoacetate levels were low. Treatment with
oral creatine resulted in clinical improvement and increased cerebral
creatine levels.

.0003
CEREBRAL CREATINE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME 3
GATM, ARG169TER

In 2 Jordanian sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with CCDS3
(612718), Verma (2010) identified a homozygous arg169-to-ter (R169X)
substitution in the GATM gene. Both patients showed delayed development
in early childhood and began to show progressive proximal muscle
weakness with features of a myopathy in their late teens. Laboratory
studies showed undetectable GAA levels. Treatment with oral creatine
supplementation resulted in dramatic improvement of muscle strength, but
speech and cognitive impairment were unchanged.

Comeaux et al. (2013) reported 2 sibs with CCDSD3 who were homozygous
for a c.505C-T transition in exon 4 of the GATM gene, resulting in an
R169X substitution.

.0004
CEREBRAL CREATINE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME 3
GATM, IVS3DS, G-T, +1

In a Chinese girl with CCDS3 (612718), Ndika et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous G-to-T transversion in intron 3 of the GATM gene
(c.484+1G-T), resulting in a splice site and a truncated protein lacking
exon 3 (Ala97ValfsTer11). The mutant transcript was subject to
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous
for the mutation. GATM activity was not detectable in patient cells. The
patient showed significant developmental progress after early and
intense treatment with creatine supplementation.

CEREBRAL CREATINE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME 3
GATM, TYR203SER

In 2 sisters, born of consanguineous parents, with CCDS3 (612718),
Nouioua et al. (2013) identified a homozygous c.608A-C transversion in
exon 4 of the GATM gene, resulting in a tyr203-to-ser (Y203S)
substitution at a highly conserved residue. Each unaffected parent was
heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 210 control
alleles.

165195	TITLE *165195 OPIOID RECEPTOR, DELTA-1; OPRD1
;;OPRD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Bzdega et al. (1993) cloned the mouse Oprd1 gene from a mouse
neuroblastoma-rat glioma hybrid cell line. The clone they isolated was
apparently identical to those reported by others (e.g., Evans et al.,
1992). They found full-length transcripts of the gene in mouse brain but
in no other tissues examined. Within the brain the gene was expressed at
low levels in many regions, but transcripts were found in particularly
large amounts in the anterior pituitary and pineal glands. Since these
tissues are located outside the blood-brain barrier, opioid peptides
easily can reach receptors in these areas from the blood.

By RT-PCR screening of melanoma cell lines for the presence of
delta-opioid receptor mRNA, Mayer et al. (2000) detected a 623-bp
product in addition to the expected 773-bp product. Ligand binding
studies confirmed the presence of the delta-opioid receptors on pigment
cells at the expected binding capacity but at somewhat lower density
than expected. Further RT-PCR screening determined that the normal
receptor is present on all normal and malignant pigment and neuronal
cells, whereas the short form is found exclusively in the tumors.
Sequence analysis indicated that the short receptor is not encoded by
the genome but results from mRNA processing and a deletion, apparently
by a transposon mechanism, of 144 bp within the third exon. This region
corresponds to the third cytoplasmic domain of the receptor molecule.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mayer et al. (2000) noted that the OPRD1 gene contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

Bzdega et al. (1993) mapped the mouse Oprd1 gene, which they called Nbor
for 'neuroblastoma opiate receptor,' to the distal region of mouse
chromosome 4 by linkage studies. It was found to lie between Lck and
Gnb-1. The human homologs of these 2 genes, LCK (153390) and GNB1
(139380), are located on human chromosome 1p; thus, the human gene for
delta-opiate receptor is probably in this region. (GNB1 is mapped to
1pter-p31.2; LCK is mapped to 1p35-p32.)

Kaufman et al. (1994) reported linkage relationships of Oprd1 on mouse
chromosome 4 and stated that the human homolog had been mapped to 1p by
in situ hybridization.

Befort et al. (1994) assigned the OPRD1 gene to chromosome 1p36.1-p34.3
by isotopic in situ hybridization and the homologous gene to mouse
chromosome 4 by the same method.

GENE FUNCTION

Jordan and Devi (1999) provided biochemical and pharmacologic evidence
for the heterodimerization of 2 fully functional opioid receptors, kappa
(OPRK1; 165196) and delta. This results in a new receptor that exhibits
ligand binding and functional properties that are distinct from those of
either receptor. Furthermore, the kappa-delta heterodimer
synergistically binds highly selective agonists and potentiates signal
transduction.

Whistler et al. (2002) identified a G protein-coupled
receptor-associated sorting protein, GASP (300417), that interacts with
the cytoplasmic tail of OPRD1 and appears to modulate OPRD1 recycling
and trafficking to lysosomes. Opioid peptide activation of HEK293 cells
transfected with GASP resulted in rapid endocytosis and proteolysis of
OPRD1. Using several binding assays with truncated GASP proteins,
Whistler et al. (2002) determined that the C-terminal portion of GASP
binds specifically to the OPRD1 tail.

Agirregoitia et al. (2006) studied the expression and localization of
delta (OPRD1), kappa (OPRK1), and mu (OPRM1; 600018) opioid receptors on
human spermatozoa and the implication in sperm motility. These receptors
are located in different parts of the head, in the middle region, and in
the tail of the sperm. Progressive motility of spermatozoa, an important
parameter to evaluate male fertility, was significantly reduced after
incubation with the mu receptor agonist morphine, whereas this effect
was antagonized in the presence of the corresponding antagonist
naloxone. The delta receptor antagonist naltrindole significantly
reduced progressive motility immediately after its addition. However,
the delta receptor agonist DPDPE had no significant effect. Finally,
neither the kappa receptor agonist U50488 nor its antagonist
norbinaltorphimine significantly affected the progressive motility of
human spermatozoa.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pharmacologic and electrophysiologic evidence indicates that opioid
receptors are involved in the mechanism of heroin dependence. Thus,
opioid receptors are appropriate candidate genes for case-control
association studies of heroin dependence. To test the hypothesis that
OPRD1 or a closely linked gene is associated with heroin dependence, Xu
et al. (2002) used 5-prime nuclease assays to genotype 2 OPRD1 SNPs in
450 Chinese heroin dependent patients and 304 unaffected controls from
the same population. In addition, 5 SNPs distributed in 4 other genes
(ADH1B, 103720; ALDH2, 100650; OPRM1, 600018; and DRD1, 126449) were
used as genomic control loci to test the case and control populations
for stratification bias. One of the SNPs, 80G, was absent from both
Chinese opioid dependence patients and controls; genotype and allele
frequencies at the other OPRD1 SNP, 921T-C, were not significantly
different.

Zhang et al. (2008) genotyped 11 SNPs in the OPRD1 gene in spanning
OPRD1 were examined in 1,063 European Americans, including 620 with
substance dependence, 557 with alcohol dependence (103780), 225 with
cocaine dependence, 111 with opioid dependence (610064), and 443
controls. Although individual SNPs in general did not show significant
associations after multiple corrections, haplotype analyses showed that
a 6-SNP haplotype, which harbors the G allele of 80G-T (dbSNP rs1042114)
and the C allele of 921C-T (dbSNP rs2234918), was significantly
associated with alcohol dependence (p = 0.002) and opioid dependence (p
less than 0.001). This haplotype yielded odds ratios of 6.43 for alcohol
dependence and 50.57 for opioid dependence.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Granier et al. (2012) reported the crystal structure of the mouse
delta-opioid receptor bound to the subtype-selective antagonist
naltrindole. Together with the structures of the mu-opioid receptor and
kappa-opioid receptor, the delta-opioid receptor structure provided
insights into conserved elements of opioid ligand recognition while also
revealing structural features associated with ligand subtype
selectivity. The binding pocket of opioid receptors can be divided into
2 distinct regions. Whereas the lower part of this pocket is highly
conserved among opioid receptors, the upper part contains divergent
residues that confer subtype selectivity. This provides a structural
explanation and validation for the 'message-address' model of opioid
receptor pharmacology, in which distinct 'message' (efficacy) and
'address' (selectivity) determinants are contained within a single
ligand. Comparison of the address region of the delta-opioid receptor
with other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) revealed that this
structural organization may be a more general phenomenon, extending to
other GPCR families as well.

ANIMAL MODEL

Filliol et al. (2000) generated Oprd1-deficient mice and compared the
behavioral responses of mice lacking Oprd1, Oprm, and Oprk1 in several
models of anxiety and depression. Their data showed no detectable
phenotype in Oprk1 -/- mutants, suggesting that kappa-receptors do not
have a role in this aspect of opioid function. Opposing phenotypes in
Oprm -/- and Oprd1 -/- mutants contrasted with the classic notion of
similar activities of mu- and delta-receptors. Anxiogenic- and
depressive-like responses in Oprd1 -/- mice indicated that
delta-receptor activity contributes to improvement of mood states.
Filliol et al. (2000) concluded that the Oprd1-encoded receptor, which
has been proposed to be a promising target for the clinical management
of pain, should also be considered in the treatment of drug addiction
and other mood-related disorders.

142600	TITLE *142600 HEXOKINASE 1; HK1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) catalyzes the first step in glucose metabolism,
using ATP for the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate.
Four different forms of hexokinase, designated type HK1, HK2 (601125),
HK3 (142570), and HK4 (138079), encoded by different genes, are present
in mammalian tissues. Among these, HK1 is the predominant glucose
phosphorylating activity in those tissues that share a strict dependence
on glucose utilization for their physiologic functions, such as brain,
erythrocytes, platelets, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts (summary by
Bianchi et al., 1997). Different isoforms of HK1 are either cytoplasmic
or associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) through a
5-prime porin (VDAC1; 604492)-binding domain (Murakami and Piomelli,
1997).

CLONING

Nishi et al. (1988) analyzed cDNA clones encoding human hexokinase
isolated from an adult kidney library. Analysis of this 917-amino acid
protein showed that the sequences of the N- and C-terminal halves,
corresponding to the regulatory and catalytic domains, respectively, are
homologous. Eukaryotic hexokinases evolved from duplication of a gene
encoding a protein of about 450 amino acids. Griffin et al. (1991)
thought that comparisons of sequences in many species supported the
theory of Ureta (1982) that the mammalian hexokinases arose from the
duplication and fusion of an ancestral protoenzyme and that the yeast
and mammalian glucokinases arose twice in evolution. Sequence analysis
demonstrated that a 15-amino acid porin-binding domain in the N terminus
of HK1 is absolutely conserved and mediates the binding of HK1 to the
mitochondria. In the course of their work, Griffin et al. (1991)
developed a method for cloning the cDNA for a low abundance protein
using knowledge of the evolutionary conservation of amino acid and
nucleotide sequence.

By liquid chromatography, Murakami et al. (1990) identified 2 distinct
major isozymes of human red blood cell (RBC) hexokinase. One had a
molecular mass similar to that of HK1 identified in liver, and the
other, designated HKR, was larger than HK1 by several kilodaltons. RBC
from normal blood contained HK1 and HKR at an equal activity, but in
reticulocyte-rich RBC, HKR dominated. Murakami and Piomelli (1997)
isolated a cDNA clone for the red cell-specific HK isozyme HKR. Its
nucleotide sequence was identical to HK1 cDNA except for the 5-prime
end. It lacks the first 62 nucleotides of the HK1 coding region;
instead, it contains a unique sequence of 60 nucleotides at the
beginning of the coding sequence as well as another unique sequence
upstream of the putative translation initiation site. It lacks the
porin-binding domain that facilitates binding to mitochondria, thus
explaining the exclusive cytoplasmic localization of red blood cell HK.
Northern blot analysis showed that it was expressed in reticulocytes and
in an erythroleukemic cell line, but not in a lymphocytic cell line.

Mori et al. (1996) reported the cloning of cDNAs representing 3 unique
human type 1 hexokinase mRNAs expressed in testis, which were not
detected by Northern blot analysis in other human tissues. These mRNAs
contained unique sequences in the 5-prime terminus and lacked the
porin-binding domain (PBD), a conserved sequence that mediates the
binding of hexokinase to the mitochondria. The sequences were similar to
those identified by Mori et al. (1993) in mouse testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ruzzo et al. (1998) determined that the HK1 gene contains 18 exons and
spans about 75 kb. Analysis of the 5-prime flanking region revealed
binding sites for AP1 and CRE as well as several binding sites for SP1.
Ruzzo et al. (1998) identified an exon 1 specific to HK1 expressed in
somatic cells; an alternative exon (exon 1R) transcribed in red blood
cells replaced the somatic exon 1 by alternative splicing. Exon 1R lacks
the porin-binding domain.

Andreoni et al. (2000) found that multiple testis-specific HK1
transcripts are encoded by 6 different exons; 5 of the exons are located
upstream from the somatic exon 1, and one is located within intron 1.
With identification of these additional exons, they determined that the
gene spans at least 100 kb.

MAPPING

Shows (1974) presented evidence from somatic cell hybrid experiments
that hexokinase and cytoplasmic glutamate oxaloacetic transaminase are
syntenic on chromosome 10. By gene dosage studies of fibroblasts,
Gitelman and Simpson (1982) mapped HK1 to 10p11-q23. By dosage effect,
Dallapiccola et al. (1981) narrowed the HK1 assignment to 10pter-p13.
Dallapiccola et al. (1984) determined HK1 activity in the red cells of 5
patients with various partial duplications of 10p and concluded that the
most likely regional assignment for HK1 is 10p11.2. By in situ
hybridization, Shows et al. (1989) regionalized the HK1 gene to 10q22.
Daniele et al. (1992) used an HK1 cDNA as a probe for the study of a
panel of human-hamster somatic cell hybrids to assign the gene to the
long arm of chromosome 10 in the region q11.2-qter. This result agrees
with those reported by Gitelman and Simpson (1982) and Shows et al.
(1989) but conflicts with that reported by Dallapiccola et al. (1984).
Daniele et al. (1992) acknowledged the possibility that the HK1 probe
they used recognized more than a single locus but concluded that if 2 or
more HK loci exist they are all located on chromosome 10. Gelb et al.
(1992) demonstrated that most of the coding region of the HK1 gene is
located in a 120-kb YAC, which mapped entirely to chromosome 10.

The genes for 3 separate hexokinases have been assigned to specific
sites as of 1997: HK1, a red-cell isoform, to chromosome 10; HK2
(601125), the major hexokinase expressed in skeletal muscle, to
chromosome 2; and HK3 (142570), an isoform in white blood cells, to
chromosome 5. Hexokinase-4 (HK4) is glucokinase (GCK; 138079), which
maps to chromosome 7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Nonspherocytic Hemolytic Anemia Due to Hexokinase Deficiency

Bianchi and Magnani (1995) reported the molecular characterization of
the defect in HK1 in a patient with hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase
deficiency (235700). PCR amplification and sequence of the cDNA revealed
compound heterozygosity for a deletion and a single nucleotide
substitution. The 96-bp deletion (142600.0001) involved nucleotides 577
to 672 of their cDNA sequence and was found in the cDNA of none of 14
unrelated normal subjects. The sequence of the HK1 allele without
deletion showed a T-to-C transition of nucleotide 1677, which caused the
amino acid change leu529-to-ser (142600.0002). The substitution was not
found in 10 normal controls. Bianchi and Magnani (1995) stated that to
their knowledge only 14 cases had been described, 2 of which had been
studied in their laboratory: HK-Melzo and HK-Napoli. It was in HK-Melzo
that the molecular defect was demonstrated. They showed that in the
HK-Melzo variant, the HK deficiency was expressed not only in
erythrocytes but also in platelets, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts. All
these types of cells contain HK type I as the predominant glucose
phosphorylating enzyme and, in particular, platelets and erythrocytes
share a strict dependence upon glucose utilization for their physiologic
functions.

In a girl, born of consanguineous parents, with severe nonspherocytic
hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase deficiency previously reported by
Rijksen et al. (1983), van Wijk et al. (2003) identified a homozygous
mutation in the HK1 gene (T680S; 142600.0004). The mutation, which
segregated with the disorder in the family and was not found in 50
controls, was designated 'Utrecht.' In vitro studies of the mutant
enzyme showed that it had a 2-fold decrease in affinity for Mg-ATP2 and
a markedly decreased affinity for the inhibitor glucose-1,6-diphosphate.
Patient red cells and platelets had about 25% residual activity.

- Russe Type of Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy

In all 34 European Gypsy individuals with the Russe type of hereditary
motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSNR; 605285) who were studied, Hantke et
al. (2009) identified a homozygous sequence change in the HK1 gene
(142600.0003) that mapped within the candidate disease interval on
chromosome 10q. The mutation was located at a highly conserved
nucleotide in the putative AltT2 exon located in the 5-prime region
upstream of HK1. The variant was found in heterozygous state in 5 of 790
control individuals representing a cross-section of the Gypsy
population, but not in 233 Bulgarian controls. AltT2-containing
transcripts in the mouse peripheral nerve were rare compared to the
coding region of HK1. However, 6 of 8 testis AltT2-containing isoforms
were found, with expression patterns differing between the peripheral
nerve and the brain and between newborn and adult tissues in mice. There
was no difference in HK1 mRNA in Schwann cells derived from patients or
controls, and patient cells showed no evidence of HK1 enzyme activity
compared to controls. Bioinformatic tools did not suggest an effect of
the variant on HK1 gene splicing or binding sites for interacting
proteins. However, there was evidence that the variant may cause a
ter-to-tyr substitution in 1 upstream open reading frame that had a
non-AUG start codon, which could potentially disrupt HK1 translation
regulation. Hantke et al. (2009) speculated that non-OMM-binding HK1 may
play a role in the pathogenesis of HMSNR.

Sevilla et al. (2013) found that 11 patients from 9 Roma Gypsy families
were homozygous for the HK1 variant (g.9712G-C; 142600.0003) identified
by Hantke et al. (2009), and haplotype analysis confirmed a founder
effect in this population.

Bianchi and Magnani (1995) demonstrated compound heterozygosity for
deletion of nucleotides 577 to 672 in the HK cDNA sequence and a
leu529-to-ser missense mutation (142600.0002).

NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY MOTOR AND SENSORY, RUSSE TYPE
HK1, -3818-195G-C, AltT2 EXON

In all 34 individuals with the Russe type of hereditary motor and
sensory neuropathy (HMSNR; 605285) who were studied, Hantke et al.
(2009) identified 2 homozygous sequence changes in the HK1 gene, which
maps within the candidate disease interval on chromosome 10q. One was a
G-to-C transversion at a highly conserved nucleotide in the putative
AltT2 exon located in the 5-prime region upstream of HK1 (-3818-195G-C,
NM_033497; Chandler, 2013), and the other was an intronic G-to-A
transition downstream of the AltT2 change; the G-to-A transition was not
highly conserved, and thus not thought to be pathogenic. These 2
variants were found in heterozygous state in 5 of 790 control
individuals representing a cross-section of the Gypsy population, but
not in 233 Bulgarian controls. AltT2-containing transcripts in the mouse
peripheral nerve were rare compared to the coding region of HK1.
However, 6 of 8 testis AltT2-containing isoforms were found, with
expression patterns differing between the peripheral nerve and the brain
and between newborn and adult tissues in mice. There was no difference
in HK1 mRNA in Schwann cells derived from patients or controls, and
patient cells showed no evidence of HK1 enzyme activity compared to
controls. Bioinformatic tools did not suggest an effect of the G-C
change on HK1 gene splicing or binding sites for interacting proteins.
However, there was evidence that the G-C change may cause a ter-to-tyr
substitution in 1 upstream open reading frame that had a non-AUG start
codon, which could potentially disrupt HK1 translation regulation.
Hantke et al. (2009) speculated that non-OMM-binding HK1 may play a role
in the pathogenesis of HMSNR.

Sevilla et al. (2013) found that 11 patients from 9 Roma Gypsy families
with progressive hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy were homozygous
for the HK1 variant (g.9712G-C) identified by Hantke et al. (2009), and
haplotype analysis confirmed a founder effect in this population. The
founding ancestor was estimated to have lived at the end of the 18th
century, when a population split occurred from a tribal group and the
Gypsy population in Spain increased under the rule of Charles III.

HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, NONSPHEROCYTIC, DUE TO HEXOKINASE DEFICIENCY
HK1, THR680SER

In a girl, born of consanguineous parents, with severe nonspherocytic
hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase deficiency (235700) previously
reported by Rijksen et al. (1983), van Wijk et al. (2003) identified a
homozygous c.2039C-G transversion in exon 15 of the HK1 gene, resulting
in a thr680-to-ser (T680S) substitution at a highly conserved residue in
the active site. The mutation, which segregated with the disorder in the
family and was not found in 50 controls, was designated 'Utrecht.' In
vitro studies of the mutant enzyme showed that it had a 2-fold decrease
in affinity for Mg-ATP2 and a markedly decreased affinity for the
inhibitor glucose-1,6-diphosphate.

103180	TITLE *103180 ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR 1; ARF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), such as ARF1, are small guanine
nucleotide-binding proteins that enhance the enzymatic activities of
cholera toxin. ARFs are essential and ubiquitous in eukaryotes, being
involved in vesicular transport and functioning as activators of
phospholipase D. The functions of ARF proteins in membrane traffic and
organelle integrity are intimately tied to their reversible association
with membranes and specific interactions with membrane phospholipids. A
common feature of these functions is their regulation by the binding and
hydrolysis of GTP (summary by Bobak et al. (1989) and Amor et al.
(1994)).

CLONING

Bobak et al. (1989) cloned 2 ARF cDNAs, ARF1 and ARF3 (103190), from a
human cerebellum library. Based on deduced amino acid sequences and
patterns of hybridization of cDNA and oligonucleotide probes with
mammalian brain poly(A)+ RNA, human ARF1 is the homolog of bovine ARF1.
Human ARF3, however, appeared to represent a newly identified, third
type of ARF, which differs from bovine ARF1 and bovine ARF2. Peng et al.
(1989) also reported cloning of ADP-ribosylation factor.

Lee et al. (1992) found that human ARF1 is identical to its bovine
counterpart, has a distinctive pattern of tissue and developmental
expression, and is encoded by an mRNA of approximately 1.9 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Coatomer, or COPI (see 601924), is a heptameric protein recruited to
membranes by ARF1. Coat assembly helps in the transport of budding off
membrane between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus.
Using fluorescence microscopy, Presley et al. (2002) showed that guanine
nucleotide exchange-activated ARF1 at the Golgi membrane recruits and
binds cytoplasmic COPI to the membranes. Photobleaching experiments
demonstrated that COPI remains at the membranes after ARF1-GTP has been
hydrolyzed by ARFGAP1 (608377). COPI binds to membrane cargo,
soluble-cargo receptors, or other Golgi proteins. Uncoating, or the
release of COPI from Golgi membranes to the cytoplasm, then occurs,
which can be inhibited by aluminum fluoride. Presley et al. (2002)
concluded from their kinetic and biochemical analyses that COPI and ARF1
continuously bind and release from Golgi membranes, allowing the
membrane at these sites to recruit cargo, alter their phospholipid
composition, and become larger, phase-separated domains.

Endocytosis of glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored proteins and
the fluid phase takes place primarily through a dynamin (see DNM1;
602377)- and clathrin (see CLTC; 118955)-independent, CDC42
(116952)-regulated pinocytic mechanism. In Chinese hamster ovary cells,
Kumari and Mayor (2008) found that reduced activity or levels of Arf1
inhibited GPI-anchored protein and fluid-phase endocytosis without
affecting other clathrin-dependent or -independent endocytic pathways.
Arf1 was activated at distinct sites on the plasma membrane, and it
recruited the CDC42 GTPase-activating protein Arhgap10 (609746) to the
plasma membrane, thereby modulating cell surface Cdc42 dynamics. Kumari
and Mayor (2008) concluded that ARF1 regulates both endocytosis and
secretion and may provide a mechanism for crosstalk between these
processes.

Using a yeast genetic screen for substrates of the Shigella flexneri
type III effector protein IpaJ, Burnaevskiy et al. (2013) identified
Arf1 and Arf2 (ARF4; 601177). Mass spectrometric analysis showed that
IpaJ cleaved the peptide bond between myristoylated gly2 and asn3 of
human ARF1. Further analysis showed that IpaJ cleaved numerous
N-myristoylated proteins with various functions. Burnaevskiy et al.
(2013) concluded that IpaJ is a cysteine protease that cleaves the
N-myrisoylated glycine from ARF1, possibly as the substrate cycles
between activity-dependent conformational states. They proposed that
cleavage of lipidated proteins may be a mechanism of microbial
pathogenesis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Amor et al. (1994) described the 3-dimensional structure of full-length
human ARF1 in its GDP-bound nonmyristoylated form.

Mossessova et al. (1998) reported the crystal structure of the catalytic
Sec7 homology domain of ARNO (602488), a human guanine nucleotide
exchange factor (GEF) for ARF1, determined at 2.2-angstrom resolution.
The Sec7 domain is an elongated, all-helical protein with a distinctive
hydrophobic groove that is phylogenetically conserved. Structure-based
mutagenesis identifies the groove and an adjacent conserved loop as the
ARF-interacting surface. The sites of Sec7 domain interaction on ARF1
have subsequently been mapped, by protein footprinting experiments, to
the switch 1 and switch 2 GTPase regions, leading to a model for the
interaction between ARF GTPases and Sec7 domain exchange factors.

Nucleotide dissociation from small G protein-GEF complexes involves
transient GDP-bound intermediates. In the case of ARF proteins, small G
proteins that regulate membrane traffic in eukaryotic cells, such
intermediates can be trapped either by the natural inhibitor brefeldin A
or by charge reversal at the catalytic glutamate of the Sec7 domain of
their GEFs. Renault et al. (2003) reported the crystal structure of
these intermediates, which shows that membrane recruitment of ARF and
nucleotide dissociation are separate reactions stimulated by the Sec7
domain. The reactions proceed through sequential rotations of the
Arf-GDP core towards the Sec7 catalytic site, and are blocked by
interfacial binding of brefeldin A and unproductive stabilization of GDP
by charge reversal.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lee et al. (1992) determined that the ARF1 gene has 4 introns and spans
approximately 16.5 kb. Exon 1 (46 bp) contains only untranslated
sequence. The 5-prime flanking region has a high GC content but no TATA
or CAAT box, as found in housekeeping genes. The authors stated that the
2 human class I ARF genes, ARF1 and ARF3, have similar exon/intron
organizations and use GC-rich promoters.

MAPPING

Hirai et al. (1996) obtained an expressed sequence tag related to the
ARF1 gene and used fluorescence in situ hybridization to assign ARF1 to
1q42.

148060	TITLE *148060 KERATIN 8; KRT8
;;K8;;
CYTOKERATIN 8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Keratin 8 is a type II keratin (Moll et al., 1982). Endo A is the mouse
equivalent. Endo B, which is the equivalent of human keratin 18
(148070), a type I keratin, is coexpressed with Endo A; the 2 appear to
be the first intermediate filament (IF) proteins expressed during murine
development (Jackson et al., 1980). Yamamoto et al. (1990) studied a
full-length cDNA for cytokeratin 8 from placenta. They determined the
distribution of cytokeratin 8 mRNA in various fetal tissues and in
placentae of different gestational ages.

Krauss and Franke (1990) cloned cytokeratin 8 from a genomic library.
The 485-amino acid protein deduced from the exon sequences has a
calculated molecular mass of about 53.5 kD. CK8 shows strong homology
with the corresponding bovine, mouse, and Xenopus proteins. The human
and mouse CK8 share about 82% identity in the N-terminal head domain,
95% identity in the alpha helical rod domain, and 67.5% identity in the
C-terminal tail.

GENE FUNCTION

He et al. (2002) presented evidence that soluble depolymerized K8
subunits were phosphorylated on ser73 by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1;
601158) upon stimulation of the proapoptotic cytokine receptor Fas
(134637) in colon carcinoma cells. K8 was also phosphorylated following
exposure to ultraviolet light. Coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated
that JNK interacted directly with K8, and K8 was able to sequester a
substantial amount of the 54-kD isoform of JNK. The association of JNK
with K8 correlated with the decreased ability of JNK to phosphorylate
endogenous c-Jun (see 165160). He et al. (2002) hypothesized that K8
phosphorylation could regulate JNK signaling and/or keratin dynamics. Ku
et al. (2002) reported the phosphorylation of K8 ser73 by p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK14; 600289). p38 MAPK associated
with K8/K18 complexes in transfected baby hamster kidney cells,
phosphorylated K8 on ser73, and bound specifically to K8 in vitro. Ku et
al. (2002) noted that the leu160-to-pro mutation in K1 (139350.0002)
leads to epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (113800). The comparable mutation
in K8 resulted in hyperphosphorylation of K8 due to neophosphorylation
of ser70 in addition to phosphorylation of ser73, and keratin filament
collapse in the presence of okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krauss and Franke (1990) determined that the CK8 gene contains 8 exons
instead of 9 as is found in all other type II cytokeratins due to lack
of intron 5, and the gene spans over 8.8 kb. The 5-prime flanking region
contains a TATA box, 1 SP1 (189906) motif, and an Alu-like sequence in
an orientation opposite that of the CK8 gene. Intron 1 is long (about
2.5 kb) and contains 3 SP1 sites, 1 AP1 (see 165160) site, and another
Alu element in the same orientation as CK8.

MAPPING

Keratins 8 and 18 of simple epithelia differ from the keratins of
stratified epithelia in tissue expression and regulation. Using PCR to
study DNAs from somatic cell hybrids, Waseem et al. (1990) located a
single active gene for keratin 8 on chromosome 12. This chromosome
contains several genes for type II keratins and also the gene for
keratin 18, the type I keratin that is coexpressed with keratin 8. This
location of both members of a keratin pair on a single chromosome is
unique among keratin genes; it is consistent with the hypothesis that
keratins 8 and 18 may be closer to an ancestral gene than the keratins
of more highly differentiated epithelia.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

About 10% of patients who undergo liver transplantation have cryptogenic
liver disease. In animal models, the absence of heteropolymeric keratins
8 and 18 or the presence of mutant keratins in hepatocytes causes or
promotes liver disease. Ku et al. (1997) demonstrated a germline
mutation in keratin 18 (148070.0001) in 1 of 28 patients with
cryptogenic cirrhosis (see 215600). Of 55 patients with cryptogenic
liver disease screened by Ku et al. (2001), 5 unrelated patients had
mutations in the keratin 8 gene that appeared to have predisposed them
to the disease. Three patients had a gly61-to-cys mutation at a highly
conserved glycine (148060.0001), and the other 2 had a tyr53-to-his
mutation (148060.0002). These mutations were not detected in patients
with other forms of liver disease or in randomly selected patients. In
transfected cells, the gly61-to-cys mutation limited keratin filament
reorganization when the cells were exposed to oxidative stress. In
contrast, the tyr53-to-his mutation destabilized keratin filaments when
transfected cells were exposed to heat or okadaic acid stress.

Following up on the observation that KRT8 and KRT18 mutations are found
in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, Ku et al. (2003) investigated
the role of keratin mutations in noncryptogenic cirrhosis and the
incidence of keratin mutations in the general population. The results
suggested that K8 and K18 are likely susceptibility genes for developing
both cryptogenic and noncryptogenic forms of liver disease. They studied
314 liver explants of patients who primarily had noncryptogenic
cirrhosis and compared the results with 349 blood bank volunteers. Seven
unique K8/K18 mutations were found in 11 independent patients with
biliary atresia, hepatitis B/C, alcoholism, primary biliary cirrhosis,
and fulminant hepatitis. Seven of the 11 patients had mutations
previously described in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis: gly61 to
cys (148060.0001), tyr53 to his (148060.0002), and his127 to leu
(148070.0001). Of the 349 blood bank control samples, only 1 contained
the tyr53-to-his mutation and 1 the gly61-to-cys mutation. Livers with
keratin mutations had cytoplasmic filamentous deposits that were less
frequent in livers without the mutations (P = 0.03).

ANIMAL MODEL

Casanova et al. (1999) generated mice expressing the human KRT8 gene,
leading to a moderate increase in the content of keratin in simple
epithelia. These mice displayed progressive exocrine pancreas
alterations, including dysplasia and loss of acinar architecture,
redifferentiation of acinar to ductal cells, inflammation, fibrosis, and
substitution of exocrine by adipose tissue, as well as increased cell
proliferation and apoptosis. The phenotype was very similar to that
reported for transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative mutant
TGF-beta type II receptor (TGFBR2; 190182). Casanova et al. (1999)
showed that these Tgfbr2 mutant mice also had elevated KRT8/KRT18
levels. The results indicated that simple epithelial keratins play a
relevant role in the regulation of exocrine pancreas homeostasis and
supported the idea that disruption of mechanisms that normally regulate
keratin expression in vivo could be related to inflammatory and
neoplastic pancreatic disorders.

Jaquemar et al. (2003) determined that the lethality seen in genetically
sensitive K8-null mouse embryos is due to disruption of the trophoblast
giant cell layer that normally forms a barrier between the maternal and
embryonic compartments. Massive hemorrhages of maternal blood were found
between the decidua capsularis and the parietal yolk sac. Maternal tumor
necrosis factor (TNF; 191160) and TNF receptor (see 191190) contributed
to the lethality.

613221	TITLE *613221 MITOCHONDRIAL CARRIER HOMOLOG 2; MTCH2
;;MET-INDUCED MITOCHONDRIAL PROTEIN; MIMP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Yerushalmi et al. (2002) cloned mouse Mtch2, which they called Mimp, and
they identified human MIMP by database analysis. The mouse and human
MIMP proteins contain 303 amino acids and share 93% identity. Mimp has
characteristics of a mitochondrial carrier protein, including 6
transmembrane domains, weak tandem repeats, and an energy transfer
signature motif. Northern blot and RNA dot-blot analyses of mouse
tissues revealed ubiquitous expression. Expression was highest in testis
and brain and moderate in smooth muscle, thyroid, submaxillary gland,
and epididymis. MIMP was also expressed in a number of human epithelial
cell lines. Transfection of epitope-tagged Mimp followed by
immunohistochemical analysis and subcellular fractionation experiments
confirmed that Mimp is a mitochondrial protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Using differential display, Yerushalmi et al. (2002) showed that
expression of mouse Mimp was upregulated by the Met (167860)-hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF; 142409) signaling pathway. Activation of an
inducible Mimp expression vector in a mouse adenocarcinoma cell line led
to dose-dependent mitochondrial depolarization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yerushalmi et al. (2002) determined that the MTCH2 gene has 13 exons and
spans at least 29 kb.

Willer et al. (2009) performed a metaanalysis of 15 genomewide
association studies for BMI comprising 32,387 participants and followed
up top signals in 14 additional cohorts comprising 59,082 participants.
Willer et al. (2009) identified dbSNP rs10838738 in the MTCH2 gene as
causing a per-allele change in BMI of 0.07 with an overall P value of
1.9 x 10(-11).

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Yerushalmi et al. (2002) mapped the MTCH2
gene to chromosome 11q12.1.

604395	TITLE *604395 MutL, E. COLI, HOMOLOG OF, 3; MLH3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is important because of its role in
maintaining genomic integrity and its association with hereditary
nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC; see 120435). To identify new human
mismatch repair proteins, Lipkin et al. (2000) probed nuclear extracts
with the conserved C-terminal interaction domain of MLH1 (120436). They
described the cloning and complete genomic sequence of MLH3, which
encodes a DNA mismatch repair protein that interacts with MLH1. They
found that MLH3 is more similar to mismatch repair proteins from yeast,
plants, worms, and bacteria than to any known mammalian protein,
suggesting that its conserved sequence may confer unique functions in
mice and humans. Cells in culture stably expressing a dominant-negative
MLH3 protein exhibited microsatellite instability.

GENE FUNCTION

To investigate whether MLH3 acts during meiotic recombination,
(Santucci-Darmanin et al. (2002)) analyzed its expression in mammalian
germ cells. The MLH3 gene was expressed in mouse meiotic cells and in
human testis, and immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the MLH3
protein was found in mouse spermatocytes. The meiosis-specific MSH4
(602105) protein, known to participate in meiotic recombination,
coimmunoprecipitated with MLH3 from mouse meiotic cell extracts. Two
MLH3 protein isoforms potentially expressed in human testis (MLH3 and
MLH3-delta-7) interacted in vitro with the MSH4 protein. The authors
suggested that MLH3 is associated with MSH4 in mammalian meiotic cells,
and that MLH3 may play a role in mammalian meiotic recombination.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization using mouse and human BACs, Lipkin
et al. (2000) mapped the respective MLH3 genes to human 14q24.3 and
mouse 12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Somatic Mutation in Colorectal Cancer

Malfunction of the mismatch repair system results in a mutator
phenotype, which is manifested as microsatellite instability (MSI). MSI
is often divided into 2 forms: MSI-high (MSI-H) and MSI-low (MSI-L),
based quantitatively on the observed frequency of genomic mutations
(Boland et al., 1998). Lipkin et al. (2001) screened 36 colon tumors and
discovered an appreciable frequency of somatic MLH3 coding mutations in
MSI-H tumors (25%). They found mutations in 8- and 9-bp polyadenine
mononucleotide runs that resulted in frameshift. The 8-bp run extended
from coding nucleotides 1747 to 1755; the 9-bp run extended from 2014 to
2021. In 4 of 6 tumors, evidence of biallelic inactivation was noted.
Furthermore, MLH3 nonsense mutations were identified in 2 of 12
microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors with 14q24 loss of heterozygosity
(see 604395.0001). Screening of 60 probands with increased genetic risk
factors for colorectal cancer susceptibility demonstrated no germline
mutations of MLH3 and no mutations in other candidate genes. While the
analyses did not exclude the existence of germline MLH3 mutations in
some such patients, they suggested that they are at most uncommon. The
finding of an appreciable frequency of somatic MLH3 mutations was
considered consistent with a possible role for this gene in the
progression of colorectal cancer tumorigenesis.

- Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer 7

Wu et al. (2001) investigated the possible role of MLH3 in hereditary
nonpolyposis colorectal cancer by scanning for mutations in 39 HNPCC
families and in 288 patients suspected of having HNPCC. They identified
10 different germline MLH3 variants, 1 frameshift and 9 missense
mutations, in 12 patients suspected of HNPCC. In 3 of the 12 patients, a
mutation was also found in MSH6 (600678). Eight of the 10 mutations were
situated in exon 1, 1 was in exon 11, and 1 was in exon 12. The same
group (Ou et al., 2009) found that all of the reported MLH3 variants
were expressed normally, localized normally in the cell nucleus, and
interacted normally with MLH1. Ou et al. (2009) concluded that there is
no evidence to support a role for MLH3 variants in HNPCC, although a
role for such variants in tumorigenesis cannot be fully excluded.

Liu et al. (2003) identified 12 variants in the MLH3 gene (see, e.g.,
604395.0005-604395.0008) in 16 (23%) of 70 probands of families with
colorectal cancer (HNPCC7; 614385), some of whom had relatives with
endometrial cancer. Most mutations showed reduced penetrance, suggesting
that MLH3 is a low-risk gene and may work together with other factors in
an additive manner. None of the tumors with MLH3 mutations showed
microsatellite instability, indicating that MLH3 does not contribute to
carcinogenesis through impaired DNA mismatch repair function.

- Esophageal Cancer

In a cohort of patients with esophageal cancer (133239), Liu et al.
(2006) found that while MLH3 is a high-risk gene with a reduced
penetrance in some families, it acts as a low-risk gene in most
families, and may work together with other genes in an accumulated
manner. They concluded that MLH3 mutations may predispose to esophageal
cancer in some families.

- Endometrial Cancer

Taylor et al. (2006) analyzed the MLH3 gene in 57 women with endometrial
cancer (608089). One patient had a germline variant (T942I) and loss of
heterozygosity at the MLH3 locus in the tumor tissue. A germline
heterozygous P844L polymorphism was found in 61% of patients. Somatic
MLH3 mutations were identified in 3 of 57 tumors. Functional expression
studies were not performed. Taylor et al. (2006) concluded that MLH3
mutations may play a role in a subset of endometrial cancers.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lipkin et al. (2000) stated that mouse Mlh3 is highly expressed in
gastrointestinal epithelium and physically maps to the mouse complex
trait locus colon cancer susceptibility-1 (Ccs1). Although Lipkin et al.
(2000) were unable to identify a mutation in the protein-coding region
of Mlh3 in the susceptible mouse strain, colon tumors from congenic Ccs1
mice exhibited microsatellite instability. Functional redundancy among
Mlh3, Pms1 (600258), and Pms2 (600259) may explain why neither Pms1 nor
Pms2 mutant mice develop colon cancer, and why PMS1 and PMS2 mutations
are only rarely found in HNPCC families.

To assess the role of Mlh3 in mammalian meiosis, Lipkin et al. (2002)
generated and characterized Mlh3 -/- mice. They showed that the null
mice are viable but sterile. Mlh3 is required for Mlh1 binding to
meiotic chromosomes and localizes to meiotic chromosomes from the
mid-pachynema stage of prophase I. Mlh3 -/- spermatocytes reached
metaphase before succumbing to apoptosis, but oocytes failed to complete
meiosis I after fertilization. The results showed that Mlh3 has an
essential and distinct role in mammalian meiosis.

In a colorectal cancer (114500) sample that showed loss of

transversion that converted codon GAG (glu) to TAG (stop) in the MLH3
gene.

.0002
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
MLH3, GLN24GLU

This variant, formerly titled COLON CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS,
TYPE 7, has been reclassified based on the findings of Korhonen et al.
(2008) and Ou et al. (2009).

Wu et al. (2001) identified a 70C-G transversion in exon 1 of the MLH3
gene, resulting in a missense gln24-to-glu (Q24E) amino acid change in a
patient with HNPCC. There was no associated mutation found in MSH6
(600678).

By in vitro functional expression studies, Ou et al. (2009) determined
that the Q24E MLH3 variant was expressed normally, localized normally in
the cell nucleus, and interacted normally with MLH1 (120436). In silico
analysis suggested no damaging effect of the change. Independent studies
by Korhonen et al. (2008) showed that the Q24E variant functioned
normally and was able to complement mismatch repair defects in cell
lines. Ou et al. (2009) concluded that there is no evidence to support a
role for this variant in HNPCC, although a role for the variant in
tumorigenesis cannot be fully excluded.

.0003

MLH3, ASN499SER

This variant, formerly titled COLON CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS,
TYPE 7, has been reclassified based on the findings of Ou et al. (2009).

Wu et al. (2001) identified a 1496A-G transition in exon 1 of the MLH3
gene, resulting in an asn499-to-ser (N499S) amino acid change, in a
patient with HNPCC.

By in vitro functional expression studies, Ou et al. (2009) determined
that the N499S MLH3 variant was expressed normally, localized normally
in the cell nucleus, and interacted normally with MLH1 (120436). In
silico analysis suggested a possibly damaging effect of the change. Ou
et al. (2009) concluded that there is no evidence to support a role for
this variant in HNPCC, although a role for the variant in tumorigenesis
cannot be fully excluded.

.0004
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
MLH3, GLU624GLN

This variant, formerly titled COLON CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS,
TYPE 7, has been reclassified based on the findings of Ou et al. (2009).

In 2 unrelated probands with HNPCC, Wu et al. (2001) found an 1870G-C
transversion in exon 1 of the MLH3 gene, predicted to result in a
glu624-to-gln (E624Q) amino acid change. Immunohistochemical analysis
demonstrated the expression of MSH2 (609309), MLH1 (see 120436), and
MSH6 (600678) in 1 patient.

Liu et al. (2003) identified the E624Q substitution in 1 patient with
familial colorectal cancer. However, none of 6 other affected family
members carried this variant, and it was found in 3.2% of controls.

By in vitro functional expression studies, Ou et al. (2009) determined
that the N499S MLH3 variant was expressed normally, localized normally
in the cell nucleus, and interacted normally with MLH1 (120436). In
silico analysis suggested no damaging effect of the change. Ou et al.
(2009) concluded that there is no evidence to support a role for this
variant in HNPCC, although a role for the variant in tumorigenesis
cannot be fully excluded.

.0005
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
MLH3, GLU1451LYS

This variant, formerly titled COLON CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS,
TYPE 7, has been reclassified based on the findings of Ou et al. (2009)
and Korhonen et al. (2008).

In 2 probands with HNPCC, Wu et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous a
4351G-A transition in exon 12 of the MLH3 gene, predicted to result in a
glu1451-to-lys (E1451K) amino acid substitution. Both probands were also
compound heterozygous for a mutation in the MSH6 gene (V878A;
600678.0006 and 650insT; 600678.0007, respectively).

Liu et al. (2003) identified the E1451K mutation in a patient with
colorectal cancer and in her sister with endometrial cancer (608089).
However, the mutation was not found in another sister with colorectal
cancer and was not found in 90 control individuals.

Kim et al. (2007) identified the E1451K variant in healthy Korean
controls and concluded that it is a polymorphism in that population.

By in vitro functional expression studies, Ou et al. (2009) determined
that the E1451K MLH3 variant was expressed normally, localized normally
in the cell nucleus, and interacted normally with MLH1 (120436). In
silico analysis suggested no damaging effect of the change. Independent
studies by Korhonen et al. (2008) showed that the E1451K variant
functioned normally and was able to complement mismatch repair defects
in cell lines. Ou et al. (2009) concluded that there is no evidence to
support a role for this variant in HNPCC, although a role for the
variant in tumorigenesis cannot be fully excluded.

COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 7
ENDOMETRIAL CANCER, INCLUDED
MLH3, 1-BP DEL, 885G

In a patient with colorectal cancer (HNPCC7; 614385), Liu et al. (2003)
identified a 1-bp deletion (885delG) in exon 1 of the MLH3 gene,
predicted to result in a frameshift and premature termination. The
mutation was found in another family member with colorectal cancer, in 1
family member with endometrial cancer (608089), and in 1 of 3 unaffected
relatives over the age of 75 years, indicating reduced penetrance. The
mutation was not found in 96 controls.

.0007
ENDOMETRIAL CANCER
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 7, INCLUDED
MLH3, VAL741PHE

In a mother and daughter with endometrial cancer (608089), Liu et al.
(2003) identified a heterozygous 2221G-T transversion in exon 1 of the
MLH3 gene, resulting in a val741-to-phe (V741F) substitution. An
unaffected aunt, over the age of 80 years, also carried the mutation,
indicating reduced penetrance. The mutation was not found in 95
controls.

Kim et al. (2007) identified a V741F mutation in a 71-year-old man with
colon cancer (HNPCC7; 614385). His 2 sisters developed gastric cancer
and breast cancer at ages 57 and 61, respectively. The authors suggested
moderate penetrance for this variant.

.0008
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 7
MLH3, TRP1276ARG

In 4 sibs with HNPCC (HNPCC7; 614385) without microsatellite
instability, Liu et al. (2003) identified a 3826T-C transition in exon 7
of the MLH3 gene, resulting in a trp1276-to-arg (W1276R) substitution.
The mutation was inherited from the mother, who had gastric cancer. The
mutation was not found in 96 controls. All 4 sibs also carried a
mutation in the MSH2 gene (609309). Liu et al. (2003) suggested that the
additive effect of these 2 mutations resulted in the phenotype. These
findings were consistent with the hypothesis that low-penetrance
additive risk alleles contribute to the risk of developing colorectal
cancer.

Liu et al. (2006) identified a W1276R substitution in 1 patient with
colorectal cancer. However, 2 unaffected family members also carried the
variant and 2 family members with esophageal cancer did not carry the
mutation.

;;GLUTAMYLCYCLOTRANSFERASE, GAMMA; GCTG;;
CHROMOSOME 7 OPEN READING FRAME 24; C7ORF24;;
CYTOCHROME c-RELEASING FACTOR, 21-KD; CRF21
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GGCT (EC 2.3.2.4) catalyzes the formation of 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamic
acid) from gamma-glutamyl dipeptides and may play a significant role in
glutathione homeostasis (Oakley et al., 2008).

CLONING

By mass spectrometric analysis of peptides obtained from an
apoptosis-inducing protein, followed by database analysis and RT-PCR of
total RNA from a human leukemia cell line, Masuda et al. (2006) cloned
GGCT, which they called CRF21. SDS-PAGE detected purified CRF21 at an
apparent molecular mass of 21 kD.

Using tryptic peptides obtained from GGCT partially purified from
expired human red blood cells for database analysis, Oakley et al.
(2008) obtained a full-length GGCT cDNA. The deduced 188-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 21 kD. EST database analysis
revealed moderate GGCT expression in a wide range of human tissues, with
highest levels in bladder and salivary gland. Database analysis
identified GGCT orthologs in a range of species from C. elegans to
mammals, but not in plants.

GENE FUNCTION

Geranylgeraniol (GGO) induces apoptosis in human tumor cell lines
through a mitochondria-dependent pathway that includes cytochrome c
release. Masuda et al. (2006) found that GGO was unable to induce
cytochrome c release from isolated human mitochondria directly, and they
identified CRF21 as a cytosolic cytochrome c-releasing factor involved
in GGO-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of CRF21 in HeLa cells induced
cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Masuda et al. (2006) noted that
GGO-induced apoptosis was inhibited by a dominant-negative mutation of
JNK (MAPK8; 601158) that impeded JNK signaling, suggesting involvement
of JNK and CRF21 in GGO-induced apoptosis.

Oakley et al. (2008) confirmed that recombinant human GGCT used
gamma-glutamyl-L-alanine as its substrate. The enzymatic kinetics were
similar to those of GGCT purified from human erythrocytes.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Oakley et al. (2008) determined the crystal structure of recombinant
human GGCT to 2.4-angstrom resolution. GGCT adopted a mixed alpha/beta
topology with 6 beta stands, 5 alpha helices, and 4 short 3(10) helices,
and it assumed a unique structural fold that the authors termed a GGCT
fold. GGCT formed dimers, and each monomer featured an invagination that
Oakley et al. (2008) proposed was the active site. The site was lined
with hydrophilic and amphipathic residues, including a conserved glu98
that appeared to function as a general acid/base in the reaction.
Mutation of glu98 to ala or gln did not alter the structural fold, but
it completely inactivated the enzyme. Mutation analysis showed that
gly23 and tyr105 also contributed to substrate binding interactions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Oakley et al. (2008) determined that the GGCT gene contains 5 exons and
spans 8 kb.

MAPPING

Bissbort et al. (1984) assigned the GGCT gene to chromosome 7pter-p14 by
somatic cell hybrid studies.

By genomic sequence analysis, Oakley et al. (2008) mapped the GGCT gene
to chromosome 7p15-p14. They identified putative GGCT pseudogenes on
chromosomes 5 and 20. Oakley et al. (2008) noted that the mouse Ggct
gene maps to a region of chromosome 6 that shares homology of synteny
with human chromosome 7p15-p14.

606273	TITLE *606273 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 2B, SUBUNIT 3; EIF2B3
;;EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 2B, GAMMA;;
EIF2B-GAMMA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The EIF2B3 gene contains a subunit of eIF2B, a heteropentameric guanine
nucleotide exchange factor necessary for the proper function of the
translation initiation factor eIF2 (see 603907). EIF2B catalyzes the
exchange of GDP for GTP (summary by Fogli et al., 2004).

CLONING

Translation of mRNA usually requires modification of the 5-prime cap,
but some viral and cellular mRNAs use a cap-independent mechanism of
ribosome binding mediated by an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES).
The 5-prime untranslated region of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is highly
conserved in all strains and folds into an IRES that binds directly to
40S ribosome subunits. Among the relatively limited number of cellular
cofactors binding to the HCV IRES/40S subunit is EIF2 (see 603907).
Using a ribozyme based selection system to identify cellular factors
involved in HCV IRES function, followed by database searches and 5-prime
RACE with ribozyme-binding sequences as primers, Kruger et al. (2000)
isolated a cDNA encoding EIF2B3, which they called EIF2B-gamma. The
deduced 452-amino acid protein is 91% identical to rat Eif2b-gamma.

Using human EST database searching and PCR, followed by screening of a
rat cDNA library, Price et al. (1996) obtained a partial cDNA encoding
human EIF2B3 and a full-length rat clone encoding Eif2b3. Northern blot
analysis revealed wide expression of an approximately 1.8-kb Eif2b3
transcript in rat tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Fogli et al. (2004) measured the guanine nucleotide exchange factor
(GEF) activity of EIF2B in transformed lymphocytes from 30 patients with
leukoencephalopathies (603896) with homozygous or compound heterozygous
mutations in EIF2B2 (606454), EIF2B3, EIF2B4 (606687), and EIF2B5
(603945) compared to 10 unaffected heterozygotes and 22 controls with no
EIF2B mutation. A significant decrease of 20 to 70% in GEF activity was
observed in all mutated cells, and the extent of the decrease correlated
with age at onset of disease. Fogli et al. (2004) suggested that a
deficiency in GEF activity underlies the encephalopathy in EIF2B-related
disease.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the EIF2B3
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP WI-14181).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM; 603896) is an
autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a chronic and progressive
course with additional episodes of rapid deterioration provoked by fever
and minor head trauma. Van der Knaap et al. (2002) demonstrated that
mutations in each of the 5 subunits of the translation initiation factor
eIF2B can cause the disorder. Two mutations were found in the EIF2B3
gene in compound heterozygous state (606273.0001, 606273.0002); 1 was
found in homozygosity (606273.0003).

In 5 of 11 unrelated Chinese patients with leukoencephalopathy with
vanishing white matter, Wu et al. (2009) identified mutations in the
EIF2B3, including 4 patients with the same mutation (I346T;
606273.0004), of whom 2 were homozygotes.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

In a 30-year-old Japanese woman, born of consanguineous parents, with
adult-onset VWM, Matsukawa et al. (2011) identified a homozygous
missense mutation in the EIF2B3 gene (L27Q; 606273.0005). In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the GDP/GTP exchange activity
of eIF2B containing mutant EIF2B3 was significantly decreased (40%
decrease) compared to wildtype, although the decrease was not as much as
observed in mutations associated with childhood-onset VWM. The findings
suggested that mutations that result in residual eIF2B activity may be
associated with a later age at disease onset.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY WITH VANISHING WHITE MATTER
EIF2B3, ARG225GLN

In a patient with leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter
(603896), van der Knaap et al. (2002) found compound heterozygosity for
2 mutations in the EIF2B3 gene: arg225 to gln (R225Q) and 1295delTG
(606273.0002). The R225Q substitution was caused by a G-to-A transition
in exon 6.

.0003
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY WITH VANISHING WHITE MATTER
EIF2B3, ALA87VAL

In a patient with leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter
(603896), van der Knaap et al. (2002) found homozygosity for an
ala87-to-val (A87V) substitution in the EIF2B3 gene, which resulted from
a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 362 in exon 2.

.0004
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY WITH VANISHING WHITE MATTER
EIF2B3, ILE346THR

In 4 of 11 unrelated Chinese patients with leukoencephalopathy with
vanishing white matter (603896), Wu et al. (2009) identified a 1037T-C
transition in exon 9 of the EIF2B3 gene, resulting in an ile346-to-thr
(I346T) substitution. The mutation was not observed in 100 control
samples. Two patients were homozygous for the mutation, 1 was compound
heterozygous with another pathogenic EIF2B3 mutation, and the second
mutation could not be identified in the fourth patient.

.0005
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY WITH VANISHING WHITE MATTER, ADULT-ONSET
EIF2B3, LEU27GLN

In a 30-year-old Japanese woman, born of consanguineous parents, with
adult-onset VWM (603896), Matsukawa et al. (2011) identified a
homozygous 80T-A transversion in the EIF2B3 gene, resulting in a
leu27-to-gln (L27Q) substitution. She developed secondary amenorrhea at
age 28 years, left hemianopia at age 29, and weakness in her left leg
after a fall. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
GDP/GTP exchange activity of eIF2B containing mutant EIF2B was
significantly decreased (40% decrease) compared to wildtype, although
the decrease was not as much as observed in mutations associated with
childhood-onset VWM. The findings suggested that mutations that result
in residual eIF2B activity may be associated with a later age at disease
onset.
