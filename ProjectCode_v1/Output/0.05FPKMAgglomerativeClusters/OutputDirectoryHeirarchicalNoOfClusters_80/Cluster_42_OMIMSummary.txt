182144	TITLE *182144 SERINE HYDROXYMETHYLTRANSFERASE, CYTOSOLIC; SHMT1
DESCRIPTION Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), a pyridoxal phosphate-containing
enzyme, catalyzes the reversible conversion of serine and
tetrahydrofolate to glycine and 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate. Some
eukaryotic cells, including human cells, contain both cytosolic and
mitochondrial forms of SHMT. Mammalian cells that lack mitochondrial
SHMT activity are auxotrophic for glycine (SHMT2; 138450). It has been
suggested that glycine synthesis from serine occurs in the mitochondria,
whereas cytosolic SHMT may catalyze the conversion of glycine to serine,
although direct evidence for this proposal is lacking. Garrow et al.
(1993) cloned human cDNAs for cytosolic and mitochondrial SHMT by
functional complementation of an Escherichia coli glyA mutant with a
human cDNA library. The cDNA for the cytosolic enzyme encoded a
483-residue protein of M(r) 53,020. The deduced protein sequence shared
63% identity with that of the SHMT2 protein. By isotopic in situ
hybridization, Garrow et al. (1993) assigned the cytosolic and
mitochondrial SHMT genes to 17p11.2 and 12q13, respectively. The high
degree of nucleotide sequence identity between the 2 isozymes as well as
the presence of keratin genes in both chromosomal regions was consistent
with these regions of chromosomes 12 and 17 having arisen by a
duplication event.

Folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism is critical for the synthesis of
numerous cellular constituents required for cell growth, and SHMT is
central to this process. Elsea et al. (1995) found that the SHMT1 gene
maps to the critical interval for Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS; 182290)
on 17p11.2. They found that the gene spans approximately 40 kb. It was
found to be deleted in all 26 SMS patients examined by PCR, fluorescence
in situ hybridization, and/or Southern analysis. Furthermore,
haploinsufficiency was indicated by the fact that SHMT enzyme activity
in patient lymphoblasts was approximately 50% that of unaffected parent
lymphoblasts. They suggested that haploinsufficiency may play a role in
the SMS phenotype and that this finding may point to possible
therapeutic interventions.

Byrne et al. (1996) described an SHMT pseudogene with 90% identity to
SHMT cDNA. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, they mapped the
pseudogene to 1p33-p32.3.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transcription factors containing the POU homeodomain have been shown to
be important regulators of tissue-specific gene expression in lymphoid
and pituitary differentiation and in early mammalian development. To
identify members of the POU family of transcription factors that may be
involved in the tissue-specific regulation of expression of genes in
insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas, Takeda et al. (1992) used PCR
and degenerate oligonucleotide primers specific for the homeodomain to
amplify POU-related sequences in human pancreatic islet mRNA. The
sequences of 2 of the PCR products were identical to human OCT1 (164175)
and 2 others were homologous to mouse Oct3. Takeda et al. (1992) showed
that 2 forms of OCT3 mRNA are expressed in adult tissues as a result of
alternative splicing--OCT3A and OCT3B. OCT3A and OCT3B are composed of
360 and 265 amino acids, respectively, of which the 225 amino acids at
the COOH-termini are identical. The sequence of human OCT3A showed 87%
amino acid identity with mouse Oct3. Reverse transcriptase PCR showed
low level of expression in both OCT3A and OCT3B mRNA in all adult human
tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Niwa et al. (2000) used conditional expression and repression in murine
embryonic stem (ES) cells to determine requirements for Oct3/4 in the
maintenance of developmental potency. Although transcriptional
determination has usually been considered as a binary on-off control
system, they found that the precise level of Oct3/4 governs 3 distinct
fates of ES cells. A less-than-2-fold increase in expression causes
differentiation into primitive endoderm and mesoderm. In contrast,
repression of Oct3/4 induces loss of pluripotency and dedifferentiation
to trophectoderm. Thus, a critical amount of Oct3/4 is required to
sustain stem cell self-renewal, and up- or downregulation induces
divergent developmental programs. Niwa et al. (2000) suggested that
their findings established a role for Oct3/4 as a master regulator of
pluripotency that controls lineage commitment and illustrated the
sophistication of critical transcriptional regulators and the consequent
importance of quantitative analyses.

Guo et al. (2002) showed that mammalian Foxd3 (611539) and Oct4 bound
identical regulatory DNA sequences in the osteopontin (SPP1; 166490)
promoter. Oct4 interacted directly with Foxd3, and both proteins
activated the osteopontin promoter, either alone or in combination.
Foxd3 also activated the Foxa1 (602294) and Foxa2 (600288) promoters,
and coexpression of Oct4 inhibited Foxd3-mediated activation of these
promoters.

Using affinity chromatography, Xu et al. (2004) showed that mouse Wwp2
(602308), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacted with Oct4. Mutation
analysis showed that the WW domains of Wwp2 were required for the
interaction, and both the N- and C-terminal regions of Oct4 could
interact with Wwp2. Wwp2 ubiquitinated Oct4 in vitro and in vivo, and
this activity required the catalytic cysteine within the HECT domain of
Wwp2. Ubiquitination of Oct4 inhibited its transcriptional activity and
directed its degradation by the proteasome. Expression of both Wwp2 and
Oct4 was reduced with differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells.

Zeineddine et al. (2006) showed that Oct3 has a role in cardiac
development in the early mouse embryo.

Wang et al. (2006) explored the protein network in which Nanog (607937)
operates in mouse ES stem cells. Using affinity purification of Nanog
under native conditions followed by mass spectrometry, Wang et al.
(2006) identified physically associated proteins. In an iterative
fashion they also identified partners of several Nanog-associated
proteins (including Oct4), validated the functional relevance of
selected newly identified components, and constructed a protein
interaction network. The network is highly enriched for nuclear factors
that are individually critical for maintenance of the ES cell state and
coregulated on differentiation. The network is linked to multiple
corepressor pathways and is composed of numerous proteins whose encoding
genes are putative direct transcriptional targets of its members. Wang
et al. (2006) concluded that this tight protein network seems to
function as a cellular module dedicated to pluripotency.

Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be generated from mouse
fibroblasts by retrovirus-mediated introduction of 4 transcription
factors, Oct3/4, Sox2 (184429), c-Myc (190080), and Klf4 (602253), and
subsequent selection for Fbx15 (609093) expression (Takahashi and
Yamanaka, 2006). These iPS cells, hereafter called Fbx15 iPS cells, are
similar to embryonic stem (ES) cells in morphology, proliferation, and
teratoma formation; however, they are different with regard to gene
expression and DNA methylation patterns, and fail to produce adult
chimeras. Okita et al. (2007) showed that selection for Nanog expression
results in germline-competent iPS cells with increased ES cell-like gene
expression and DNA methylation patterns compared with Fbx15 iPS cells.
The 4 transgenes were strongly silenced in Nanog iPS cells.

Wernig et al. (2007) independently demonstrated that the transcription
factors Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 can induce epigenetic reprogramming
of a somatic genome to an embryonic pluripotent state. In contrast to
selection for Fbx15 activation (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006),
fibroblasts that had reactivated the endogenous Oct4 (Oct4-neo) or Nanog
(Nanog-neo) loci grew independently of feeder cells, expressed normal
Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 RNA and protein levels, were epigenetically
identical to ES cells by a number of criteria, and were able to generate
viable chimeras, contribute to the germline, and generate viable
late-gestation embryos after injection into tetraploid blastocysts.
Transduction of the 4 factors generated significantly more
drug-resistant cells from Nanog-neo than from Oct4-neo fibroblasts, but
a higher fraction of Oct4-selected cells had all the characteristics of
pluripotent ES cells, suggesting that Nanog activation is a less
stringent criterion for pluripotency than Oct4 activation.

Using Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and Myc, Park et al. (2008) derived iPS cells
from fetal, neonatal, and adult human primary cells, including dermal
fibroblasts isolated from a skin biopsy of a healthy research subject.
Human iPS cells resemble embryonic stem cells in morphology and gene
expression and in the capacity to form teratomas in immune-deficient
mice. Park et al. (2008) concluded that defined factors can reprogram
human cells to pluripotency, and they established a method whereby
patient-specific cells might be established in culture.

Yu et al. (2007) showed that 4 factors, OCT4, SOX2 (184429), NANOG
(607937), and LIN28 (611043), are sufficient to reprogram human somatic
cells to pluripotent stem cells that exhibit the essential
characteristics of embryonic stem cells. These induced pluripotent human
stem cells have normal karyotypes, express telomerase activity, express
cell surface markers and genes that characterize human ES cells, and
maintain the developmental potential to differentiate into advanced
derivatives of all 3 primary germ layers.

Kim et al. (2008) showed that adult mouse neural stem cells express
higher endogenous levels of Sox2 and c-Myc than embryonic stem cells and
that exogenous Oct4 together with either Klf4 or c-Myc is sufficient to
generate iPS cells from neural stem cells. These 2-factor iPS cells are
similar to embryonic stem cells at the molecular level, contribute to
development of the germ line, and form chimeras. Kim et al. (2008)
proposed that, in inducing pluripotency, the number of reprogramming
factors can be reduced when using somatic cells that endogenously
express appropriate levels of complementing factors.

Stadtfeld et al. (2008) generated mouse iPS cells from fibroblasts and
liver cells by using nonintegrating adenoviruses transiently expressing
Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. These adenoviral iPS cells showed DNA
demethylation characteristic of reprogrammed cells, expressed endogenous
pluripotency genes, formed teratomas, and contributed to multiple
tissues, including the germ cell line, in chimeric mice. Stadtfeld et
al. (2008) concluded that their results provided strong evidence that
insertional mutagenesis is not required for in vitro reprogramming.

Okita et al. (2008) independently reported the generation of mouse iPS
cells without viral vectors. Repeated transfection of 2 expression
plasmids, one containing the cDNAs of Oct3/4, Sox2, and Klf4 and the
other containing the c-Myc cDNA, into mouse embryonic fibroblasts
resulted in iPS cells without evidence of plasmid integration, which
produced teratomas when transplanted into mice and contributed to adult
chimeras. Okita et al. (2008) concluded that the production of
virus-free iPS cells, albeit from embryonic fibroblasts, addresses a
critical safety concern for potential use of iPS cells in regenerative
medicine.

Donohoe et al. (2009) demonstrated that OCT4 lies at the top of the X
chromosome inactivation (XCI) hierarchy, and regulates XCI by triggering
X chromosome pairing and counting. OCT4 directly binds TSIX (300181) and
XITE (300074), 2 regulatory noncoding RNA genes of the X inactivation
center, and also complexes with SCI transfactors CTCF (604167) and YY1
(600013) through protein-protein interactions. Depletion of Oct4 in
female mouse embryonic stem cells blocked homologous X-chromosome
pairing and resulted in the inactivation of both X chromosomes. Donohoe
et al. (2009) concluded that they identified the first trans-factor that
regulates counting, and ascribed new functions to OCT4 during X
chromosome reprogramming.

Kim et al. (2009) showed that Oct4 alone is sufficient to directly
reprogram adult mouse neural stem cells to iPS cells. Kim et al. (2009)
then showed that OCT4 alone could convert human fetal neural stem cells
into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.

Hanna et al. (2009) demonstrated that the reprogramming by Oct4, Sox2,
Klf4, and Myc transcription factors is a continuous stochastic process
where almost all mouse donor cells eventually give rise to iPS cells on
continued growth and transcription factor expression. Additional
inhibition of the p53 (191170)/p21 (116899) pathway or overexpression of
Lin28 increased the cell division rate and resulted in an accelerated
kinetics of iPS cell formation that was directly proportional to the
increase in cell proliferation. In contrast, Nanog (607937)
overexpression accelerated reprogramming in a predominantly cell
division rate-independent manner. Quantitative analyses defined distinct
cell division rate-dependent and -independent modes for accelerating the
stochastic course of reprogramming, and suggested that the number of
cell divisions is a key parameter driving epigenetic reprogramming to
pluripotency.

The generation of iPS cells is asynchronous and slow, the frequency is
low (less than 0.1%), and DNA demethylation constitutes a bottleneck. To
determine regulatory mechanisms involved in reprogramming, Bhutani et
al. (2010) generated interspecies heterokaryons (fused mouse ES cells
and human fibroblasts) that induced reprogramming synchronously,
frequently, and fast. Bhutani et al. (2010) showed that reprogramming
toward pluripotency in single heterokaryons was initiated without cell
division or DNA replication, rapidly (1 day) and efficiently (70%).
Short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown showed that AID (605257) is
required for promoter demethylation and induction of OCT4 and NANOG gene
expression. AID protein bound silent methylated OCT4 and Nanog promoters
in fibroblasts, but not active demethylated promoters in ES cells.
Bhutani et al. (2010) concluded that their data provided the first
evidence that mammalian AID is required for active DNA demethylation and
initiation of nuclear reprogramming toward pluripotency in human somatic
cells.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq), Kunarso et
al. (2010) showed that genomic regions bound by CTCF were highly
conserved between undifferentiated mouse and human embryonic stem cells.
However, very little conservation was found for regions bound by OCT4
and NANOG. Most of the differences in OCT4 and NANOG binding between
species appeared to be due to species-specific insertion of transposable
elements, such as endogenous ERV1 repeats, that generated unique OCT4-
and NANOG-repeat-associated binding sites.

Chia et al. (2010) reported a genomewide RNA interference screen to
identify genes that regulate self-renewal and pluripotency properties in
human embryonic stem cells. Functionally distinct complexes involved in
transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling were among the
factors identified in the screen. To understand the roles of these
potential regulators of human embryonic stem cells, Chia et al. (2010)
studied transcription factor PRDM14 (611781) to gain insights into its
functional roles in the regulation of pluripotency. Chia et al. (2010)
showed that PRDM14 regulates directly the expression of key pluripotency
gene POU5F1 through its proximal enhancer. Genomewide location profiling
experiments revealed that PRDM14 colocalized extensively with other key
transcription factors such as OCT4, NANOG (607937), and SOX2 (184429),
indicating that PRDM14 is integrated into the core transcriptional
regulatory network. More importantly, in a gain-of-function assay, they
showed that PRDM14 is able to enhance the efficiency of reprogramming of
human fibroblasts in conjunction with OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 (602253).

GENE STRUCTURE

Takeda et al. (1992) showed that the OCT3 gene spans about 7 kb and
consists of 5 exons.

MAPPING

Using pairs of sequence-specific primers and DNA from a panel of somatic
cell hybrids, Takeda et al. (1992) mapped the OCT3 gene to chromosome 6.
This localization was confirmed by linkage of a RFLP in 9 CEPH families,
indicating tight linkage to HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DR. No recombinants were
identified with any of these and lod scores ranged from 5.72 to 10.84.
By in situ hybridization, Guillaudeux et al. (1993) mapped the OTF3 gene
to 6p22-p21.3 within or close to the human MHC class I region. The
homologous mouse gene, Otf3, is located on mouse chromosome 17 between
the Q and T regions of the major histocompatibility complex. Takeda et
al. (1992) identified a related gene, symbolized OTF3C (OTF3P1), which
is a retroposon located on human chromosome 8; this gene is a
pseudogene. Guillaudeux et al. (1993) localized one OTF3-like copy
(OTF3L) to 12p13 by in situ hybridization. The functional significance
of this gene was not known. Using recombinant families, pulsed field gel
electrophoresis, and YAC mapping, Crouau-Roy et al. (1994) localized the
OTF3 gene within the MHC class I region, approximately 100 kb telomeric
to the HLA-C gene.

CYTOGENETICS

- POU5F1/EWS Fusion Gene

Yamaguchi et al. (2005) identified a t(6;22)(p21;q12) translocation in
tumor tissue derived from an undifferentiated sarcoma from the pelvic
bone of a 39-year-old woman. The translocation resulted in a POU5F1/EWS
(EWSR1; 133450) chimeric gene composed of the N-terminal domain of EWS
that functions as a transcriptional activation domain and the C-terminal
DNA-binding domain of POU5F1. Yamaguchi et al. (2005) suggested that the
tumor may be a variant of Ewing sarcoma (612219).

ANIMAL MODEL

Via homologous recombination in ES cells, Nichols et al. (1998)
generated mice with targeted disruption of the Oct4, or Oct3, gene.
Oct4-deficient embryos developed to the blastocyst stage, but the inner
cell mass cells were not pluripotent. Instead, they were restricted to
differentiation along the extraembryonic trophoblast lineage.
Furthermore, in the absence of a true inner cell mass, trophoblast
proliferation was not maintained in Oct4 -/- embryos. Expansion of
trophoblast precursors was restored, however, by an Oct4 target gene
product, fibroblast growth factor-4 (see 164980). Therefore, Oct4 also
determines paracrine growth factor signaling from stem cells to the
trophectoderm. Nichols et al. (1998) concluded that the activity of Oct4
is essential for the identity of the pluripotential founder cell
population in the mammalian embryo.

Tay et al. (2008) demonstrated the existence of many naturally occurring
miRNA targets in the amino acid coding sequences of the mouse Nanog
(607937), Oct4, and Sox2 (184429) genes. Some of the mouse targets
analyzed do not contain the miRNA seed, whereas others span exon-exon
junctions or are not conserved in the human and rhesus genomes. MiRNA134
(610164), miRNA296 (610945), and miRNA470, upregulated on retinoic
acid-induced differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells, target the
coding sequence of each transcription factor in various combinations,
leading to transcriptional and morphologic changes characteristic of
differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, and resulting in a new
phenotype. Silent mutations at the predicted targets abolished miRNA
activity, prevented the downregulation of the corresponding genes, and
delayed the induced phenotype. Tay et al. (2008) concluded that their
findings demonstrated the abundance of coding sequence-located miRNA
targets, some of which can be species-specific, and supported an
augmented model whereby animal miRNAs exercise their control on mRNAs
through targets that can reside beyond the 3-prime untranslated region.

HISTORY

Oct3 is present in mouse oocytes before and after fertilization. Rosner
et al. (1991) reported that when fertilized oocytes were injected with
antisense Oct3 oligonucleotides or double-stranded DNA containing the
octamer motif, embryonic DNA synthesis was inhibited and the embryos
were arrested at the 1-cell stage. In vitro synthesized Oct3 mRNA
rescued the developmental block induced by antisense Oct3
oligonucleotide. Thus, maternally inherited Oct3 appeared to be required
for DNA replication and division of the 1-cell embryo. However, the
authors published a retraction: 'Recent investigations have revealed
that the experimental evidence supporting the conclusions of the paper
by Rosner et al. (Cell 64, 1103-1110, 1991) has been fabricated by one
of the authors (M.R.) without any knowledge by the others. We therefore
retract this paper in its entirety.' This seems to be scientific fraud
comparable to that perpetrated by the infamous John R. Darsee, who
confessed to fabrication of data showing linkage of HLA and familial
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (192600).

605129	TITLE *605129 PROTEASOME ACTIVATOR SUBUNIT 3; PSME3
;;PROTEASOME ACTIVATOR 28-GAMMA; PA28G;;
PA28-GAMMA;;
REG-GAMMA;;
KI ANTIGEN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PSME3 belongs to the proteasome activator subunit (PSME) gene family.
For background information on the PSME gene family, see PSME1 (600654).

CLONING

Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700) produce
autoantibodies against a number of nuclear antigens, including SNRP70
(180740), PCNA (176740), CDR1 (302650), and Ki. By screening a human
placenta cDNA library with a probe obtained by screening a bovine retina
cDNA library with anti-Ki sera from an SLE patient, Nikaido et al.
(1990) isolated a cDNA encoding PSME3, which they called Ki. Sequence
analysis predicted that the 254-amino acid, hydrophilic PSME3 protein
contains a nuclear localization signal and has a molecular mass of
approximately 30 kD, close to the 32 kD observed by Western blot
analysis. PSME3 shares over 99% amino acid identity with the bovine
sequence. RNA blot analysis of human placenta, bovine brain, and mouse
embryos detected 3.0- and 1.5-kb PSME3 transcripts.

GENE FUNCTION

Steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC3, or NCOA3; 601937) is an oncogene
frequently amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer. Using
immunoprecipitation analysis, Li et al. (2006) found that endogenous
SRC3 and REG-gamma interacted in HeLa cell nuclear extracts and MCF-7
breast cancer cells. Protein pull-down assays showed the REG-gamma
interacted specifically with the HAT domain of SRC3. Knockdown of
REG-gamma via RNA interference (RNAi) in breast cancer and human
embryonic kidney cell lines resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in SRC3
protein levels. Conversely, REG-gamma overexpression in HeLa cells
reduced SRC3 protein levels. In vitro proteasome assays using purified
proteins showed that REG-gamma promoted degradation of SRC3 by the 20S
proteasome in a ubiquitin- and ATP-independent manner. Knockdown of
REG-gamma via RNAi increased estrogen receptor (ER; see 133430) target
gene expression and enhanced estradiol-mediated cell growth in MCF-7
cells, and these effects were secondary to the effect of REG-gamma on
SRC3.

MAPPING

By analysis of overlapping YAC contigs and by FISH, Albertsen et al.
(1994) mapped the PSME3 gene to 17q12-q21. Kandil et al. (1997) mapped
the mouse Psme3 gene to chromosome 14 using interspecific backcross
analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Barton et al. (2004) found that mice lacking Psme3 had normal levels of
surface class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules,
slightly reduced Cd8 (see 186910)-positive T cells, and normal responses
to infection with influenza or SV40 virus. However, the ability of Psme3
-/- mice to clear the pulmonary fungal pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum
was slower than wildtype mice. Barton et al. (2004) proposed that PSME3
functions in the MHC class I antigen-processing pathway and that it
exerts an influence on proteasome cleavage specificity.

603033	TITLE *603033 COLLAGENIC TAIL OF ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE; COLQ
;;ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE-ASSOCIATED COLLAGEN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The COLQ gene encodes a collagen-like strand that associates into a
triple helix to form a tail that anchors catalytic subunits of
acetylcholinesterase (ACHE; 100740) to the basal lamina.

Asymmetric AChE is the major form of AChE at the endplate of the
neuromuscular junction in higher vertebrates. Asymmetric AChE is
composed of the T isoform of ACHE, ACHE(T), linked to a triple helical
COLQ tail. AChE rapidly hydrolyzes acetylcholine released at cholinergic
synapses in the nervous system, thus limiting the number of collisions
between ACh and the ACh receptor (AChR), and the duration of the
synaptic response (Ohno et al., 1998).

CLONING

Krejci et al. (1991) cloned ColQ from Torpedo. Krejci et al. (1997)
cloned the rat and mouse ColQ genes, and found that the ColQ subunits
form homotrimers and attach to AChE. Northern blot analysis detected
ColQ expression in cholinergic tissues, brain, muscle, and heart, as
well as in noncholinergic tissues such as lung and testes.

Ohno et al. (1998) used mouse ColQ primers to isolate human COLQ cDNA
from a human adult skeletal muscle cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a
deduced 455-amino acid protein with 89% homology to the rodent ColQ
peptide. Conserved domains include a secretion signal peptide, a
proline-rich attachment domain (PRAD) that interacts with AChE(T), 2
cysteines that form disulfide bonds with AChE(T), a collagen domain,
conserved cysteines that stabilize the tripal helical domain, and
proteoglycan binding domains that anchor the tripal helical domain to
the basal lamina. Several alternative transcripts were identified.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ohno et al. (1998) determined that the COLQ gene spans approximately 50
kb and comprises 17 constitutive exons and 2 alternatively transcribed
exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ohno et al. (1998) mapped the
COLQ gene to chromosome 3p25. By radiation hybrid analysis, Donger et
al. (1998) mapped the COLQ gene to chromosome 3p24.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with endplate AChE deficiency (EAD; 603034), Ohno et al.
(1998) identified 6 recessive mutations in the COLQ gene
(603033.0001-603033.0006). Coexpression of each of the 6 ColQ mutants
with wildtype AChE(T) in SV40-transformed monkey kidney fibroblast (COS)
cells showed that a mutation proximal to the ColQ attachment domain for
AChE(T) prevented association of ColQ with AChE(T); mutations distal to
the attachment domain generated a mutant species of acetylcholinesterase
composed of 1 AChE(T) tetramer and a truncated ColQ strand. The authors
concluded that the mutations prevented the insertion of the gene product
into the basal lamina.

In 6 sibs with a mild form of endplate AChE deficiency, Donger et al.
(1998) identified a homozygous mutation in the COLQ gene (603033.0007).

Shapira et al. (2002) reported 3 novel mutations in the COLQ gene in 8
patients with variable features of EAD: 1 patient was a compound
heterozygote; the other 7 patients, 6 Palestinian Arabs and 1 Iraqi Jew,
were all homozygous for a gly240-to-ter mutation (G240X; 603033.0010),
suggesting a founder mutation. Expression studies of the 3 mutations in
COS-7 cells showed that each prevented formation of insertion competent
asymmetric AChE.

ANIMAL MODEL

Feng et al. (1999) generated ColQ -/- mice to study the roles played by
ColQ and AChE in synapses and elsewhere. Such mice failed to thrive and
most died before reaching maturity. They completely lacked asymmetric
AChE in skeletal and cardiac muscles, specifically at the neuromuscular
junction and in the brain. Nonetheless, neuromuscular function was
present. A compensatory mechanism appeared to be a partial ensheathment
of nerve terminals by Schwann cells. Such mice also lacked the
asymmetric forms of Bche (177400). Surprisingly, globular AChE tetramers
were absent as well, suggesting a role for the ColQ gene in assembly or
stabilization of AChE forms that do not contain a collagenous subunit.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, 215-BP DEL, NT107

In a patient with endplate acetylcholinesterase deficiency (603034),
Ohno et al. (1998) found deletion of 215 basepairs following nucleotide
107 of the COLQ gene. The deletion was caused by skipping of exons 2 and
3, causing a frameshift after codon 35. The mutation abolished the
proline-rich attachment domain (PRAD) and predicted 25 missense codons
followed by a stop codon. The mutation was present in compound
heterozygous state with the E214X mutation (603033.0002). The deletion
mutation was inherited from the mother and the truncating mutation from
the father.

.0002
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, GLU214TER

See 603033.0001 and Ohno et al. (1998). In another patient with EAD
(603034), Ohno et al. (1998) identified homozygosity for the
glu214-to-ter (E214X) mutation.

.0003
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, SER169TER

In a patient with EAD (603034), Ohno et al. (1998) identified a
homozygous ser169-to-ter (S169X) mutation, which resulted in loss of the
distal two-thirds of the collagen domain.

.0004
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, ARG282TER

In a patient with EAD (603034), Ohno et al. (1998) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the COLQ gene: an arg282-to-ter
(R282X) mutation and a 1-bp deletion (1082delC). The R282X mutation
truncated COLQ 10 codons upstream to the C-terminal end of the collagen
domain. The 1-bp deletion caused a frameshift after codon 360,
predicting 64 missense codons followed by a stop codon; 1082delC spared
the entire collagen domain but abolished the C-terminal domain of COLQ.

.0005
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, 1-BP DEL, 1082C

See 603033.0005 and Ohno et al. (1998). In another patient with EAD
(603034), Ohno et al. (1998) identified homozygosity for the 1082delC
mutation. The asymptomatic parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

.0006
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, 1-BP INS, 788C

In a patient with EAD (603034), Ohno et al. (1998) identified a
homozygous 1-bp insertion (788insC) in the COLQ gene that caused a
frameshift after codon 262, predicting 36 missense codons followed by a
stop codon. The 788insC mutation spared 85% of the collagen domain. The
asymptomatic parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

.0007
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, TYR431SER

In 6 affected sibs in a consanguineous Spanish family with EAD (603034),
Donger et al. (1998) identified a homozygous tyr431-to-ser (Y431S)
substitution in the conserved C-terminal domain of COLQ. The mutation
was predicted to disturb the attachment of collagen-tailed
acetylcholinesterase to the neuromuscular junction. Donger et al. (1998)
referred to the disorder in these patients as CMS Ic (for congenital
myasthenic syndrome type Ic). The authors noted that most previously
described CMS Ic patients had a marked decrease in total muscle
acetylcholinesterase with essentially no collagen-tailed forms. These
forms were present in affected members of the Spanish family but the
defect interfered with attachment to the neuromuscular junction.

.0008
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, ARG315TER

Ohno et al. (1999) described a patient with congenital EAD (603034)
caused by compound heterozygosity for an arg315-to-ter (R315X) mutation
and a splice donor site mutation at position +3 of intron 16 of COLQ
(603033.0009).

.0009
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, IVS16DS, A-G, +3

See 603033.0008 and Ohno et al. (1999). Using a minigene harboring the
COLQ IVS16+3A-G mutation for functional expression studies, Ohno et al.
(1999) found that the splice site mutation resulted in skipping of exon
16. The mutant splice donor site of intron 16 harbors 5 discordant
nucleotides (at -3, -2, +3, +4, and +6) that do not basepair with U1
small nuclear (sn) RNA (RNU1; 180680), the RNA responsible for splice
donor site recognition. Versions of the minigene harboring, at either +4
or +6, nucleotides complementary to U1 snRNA restored normal splicing.
Analysis of 1,801 native splice donor sites revealed that the presence
of a G nucleotide at +3 is associated with preferential usage, at
positions +4 to +6, of nucleotides concordant to U1 snRNA. Analysis of
11 disease-associated IVS+3A-G mutations indicated that, on average, 2
of 3 nucleotides at positions +4 to +6 failed to basepair, and that the
nucleotide at +4 never basepaired, with U1 snRNA. Ohno et al. (1999)
concluded that, with G at +3, normal splicing generally depends on the
concordance that residues at +4 to +6 have with U1 snRNA, but other
cis-acting elements may also be important in assuring the fidelity of
splicing.

.0010
ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, GLY240TER

In 6 Palestinian Arabs and 1 Iraqi Jew with variable features of EAD
(603034), Shapira et al. (2002) identified a homozygous 718G-T
transition in a splice acceptor consensus sequence of exon 12 of the
COLQ gene, resulting in a gly240-to-ter (G240X) mutation and causing
premature termination of the protein. The mutation prevented proper
formation of asymmetric AChE in COS-7 cells. The patients demonstrated
phenotypic variability, including differences in age of onset, disease
progression, respiratory and feeding difficulties, severity of weakness,
and ophthalmoplegia.

;;PROTEIN INCORPORATED LATER INTO TIGHT JUNCTIONS; PILT;;
TIGHT JUNCTION PROTEIN 4; TJP4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse 11-day-old embryo library using
human DLG2 (603583) SH3 and GK domains as bait, Kawabe et al. (2001)
cloned mouse Tjap1, which they called Pilt. By database analysis, they
identified full-length human TJAP1, which encodes a 547-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 60.7 kD. TJAP1 contains an
N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a central proline-rich region, and
shares 74% amino acid identity with its mouse homolog. TJAP1 shares 43%
and 51% amino acid identity over its N-terminal and C-terminal regions,
respectively, with the same regions of BEGAIN. SDS-PAGE detected TJAP1
as an 86-kD band. Northern blot analysis detected an approximately
3.0-kb transcript in all 16 human tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunofluorescence microscopy of mouse mammary tumor cells, Kawabe et
al. (2001) localized TJAP1 to cell-cell junctions where it colocalized
with ZO-1 (TJP1; 601009) at tight junctions. Using endogenous and stably
expressed TJAP1, the authors confirmed colocalization of TJAP1 and ZO-1
to tight junctions in small intestine cells where TJAP1 localized to the
Golgi complex. TJAP1 was absent from apical junctions and desmosomes. By
observing TJAP1 incorporation into cell-cell junctions over time in a
mouse wound healing model, the authors showed that TJAP1 was
incorporated into tight junctions at the very late stages of cell-cell
junction formation. Kawabe et al. (2001) used GST pull-down assays to
confirm that TJAP1 binds DLG2. Immunohistochemical studies using
cadherin deficient L-cells expressing claudin-1 (CLDN1; 603718) or JAM
(JAM1; 605721) showed no evidence of interaction between TJAP1 and
either of these 2 proteins.

609516	TITLE *609516 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 382; ZNF382
;;KRAB/ZINC FINGER SUPPRESSOR PROTEIN 1, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; KS1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor family, such as
ZNF382, play key roles in the regulation of cell proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis in response to a variety of stimuli
(Gebelein et al., 1998).

CLONING

Gebelein et al. (1998) cloned rat Znf382, which they called Ks1.
Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of Ks1, with
highest levels in lung, kidney, and testis. Immunofluorescence
localization detected epitope-tagged Ks1 in the nucleus following
transfection of a human pancreatic cell line.

By screening a fetal heart cDNA library using PCR primers designed to
amplify KRAB domain-encoding sequences, followed by EST database
analysis and RACE of fetal heart RNA, Luo et al. (2002) cloned ZNF382.
The deduced 548-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
about 64 kD. ZNF382 contains N-terminal KRAB A and KRAB B domains,
followed by a vestigial zinc finger, a nuclear localization signal, and
9 tandemly repeated Kruppel-type C2H2-zinc finger domains at its C
terminus. ZNF382 shares 91% and 83% amino acid identity with rat Ks1 in
the KRAB and zinc finger domains, respectively. Northern blot analysis
detected a 2.9-kb transcript abundantly expressed in heart. Weaker
expression was detected in skeletal muscle, but no expression was
detected in 6 other tissues examined. Expression of ZNF382 was more
widespread in human fetal tissues. Whole 34- and 40-day embryos showed
high ZNF382 expression. At later developmental stages, ZNF382 was
detected predominantly in cerebellum, kidney, and cerebrum, and to a
lesser extent in lung, heart, skeletal muscle, tongue, and adrenal
gland.

GENE FUNCTION

By biochemical analysis, Gebelein et al. (1998) determined that rat Ks1
contains 2 transcriptional repressor domains, R1 and R2. R1 corresponds
to the KRAB A motif, and R2 is located immediately after the KRAB B
motif. Expression of rat Ks1 in a mouse fibroblast line suppressed
neoplastic transformation mediated by Hras (190020) and other potent
oncogenes. Deletion analysis indicated that R2 was required to suppress
transformation.

Using a random oligonucleotide-binding assay, Gebelein and Urrutia
(2001) identified a 27-bp rat Ks1-binding element (KBE). Deletion and
site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the 9 C-terminal zinc fingers
and the KRAB domain of Ks1 were required for transcriptional repression
through the KBE site. The KRAB domain of Ks1 interacted with the KAP1
(TRIM28; 601742) corepressor, and mutations that abolished this
interaction alleviated Ks1-mediated transcriptional repression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Luo et al. (2002) determined that the ZNF382 gene contains 5 exons and
spans about 23 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Luo et al. (2002) mapped the ZNF382 gene
to chromosome 19q13.13.

610284	TITLE *610284 LIPOYLTRANSFERASE 1; LIPT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In mammals, lipoyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.181) catalyzes the second of 2
steps in the covalent attachment of lipoic acid to lipoate-dependent
proteins, including the glycine cleavage system H protein (GCSH; 238330)
and the dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2) subunits of the pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex (DLAT; 608770), the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
complex (DLST; 126063), and the branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase
complex (DBT; 248610) (Fujiwara et al., 1999).

CLONING

Using a bovine lipoyltransferase cDNA fragment as probe, Fujiwara et al.
(1999) cloned human LIPT1 from a liver cDNA library. The deduced
373-amino acid precursor protein shares 88% and 31% sequence identity
with bovine lipoyltransferase II and E. coli lipoate-protein ligase A,
respectively. By alignment of LIPT1 with the bovine lipoyltransferase
amino acid sequence, Fujiwara et al. (1999) predicted that the
N-terminal 26 amino acids comprise a mitochondrial targeting sequence,
with the threonine-27 corresponding to the first residue of the mature
enzyme. Thus, the deduced mature LIPT1 enzyme contains 347 amino acids
with a calculated molecular mass of 39.539 kD. Northern blot analysis
detected a major 1.5-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in skeletal muscle and heart, followed by liver, brain,
placenta, and lung.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fujiwara et al. (1999) determined that the LIPT1 gene contains 4 exons
and spans 8 kb of genomic DNA. They found evidence of several LIPT1
transcripts resulting from alternative splicing in the 5-prime
untranslated region.

MAPPING

By FISH, Fujiwara et al. (1999) mapped the LIPT1 gene to chromosome
2q11.2.
