609959	TITLE *609959 MYELOID-ASSOCIATED DIFFERENTIATION MARKER; MYADM
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display analysis, Pettersson et al. (2000) identified
mouse myeloid-associated differentiation marker (Myadm) based upon its
varied expression during differentiation of an Il3 (147740)-dependent
myeloid progenitor cell line established from mouse bone marrow. The
deduced protein contains 8 potential transmembrane domains and several
potential phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis on hematopoietic
cell lines revealed restricted expression of Myadm to cells belonging to
the myeloid lineage. Expression was also seen in mature granulocytes and
macrophages. Tissue analysis showed high expression of Myadm in lung and
more moderate expression in bone marrow and brain. RT-PCR experiments
demonstrated expression of Myadm in multipotent cells
(c-kit+Sca-1+Lin-), erythroid progenitors, and early lymphoid
progenitors.

By database searching with mouse Myadm as query, Cui et al. (2002)
identified human MYADM and cloned a full-length MYADM sequence from a
human bone marrow cDNA library. The deduced 298-amino acid protein has a
predicted molecular mass of 32 kD. It contains 7 predicted transmembrane
domains and shows sequence homology with the T-cell differentiation
protein MAL (188860) and plasmolipin (PLMP; 600340). MYADM shares 75.8%
overall sequence identity with mouse Myadm, with highest levels of
conservation seen in the predicted transmembrane regions. Northern blot
analysis detected 3.3- and 2.2-kb MYADM transcripts. Expression of the
longer transcript was seen in all tissues tested except thymus;
expression of the shorter transcript was seen in heart, placenta, lung,
pancreas, testis, and peripheral blood leukocytes and was undetectable
in all other tissues. Semiquantitative PCR assays showed that expression
of MYADM was not only significantly higher in peripheral blood
leukocytes than in bone marrow cells, but was also upregulated in NB4
cells (derived from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia) that
were treated with the differentiation inducer all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA).

GENE FUNCTION

Using antisense Myadm oligonucleotides, Pettersson et al. (2000) showed
that downregulation of mouse Myadm expression in pluripotent
hematopoietic progenitor cells inhibited colony formation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cui et al. (2002) determined that the MYADM gene contains 3 exons and
spans 7.1 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Cui et al. (2002) mapped the MYADM gene to
chromosome 19q13.33-q13.4.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIR181C, are short noncoding RNAs that
repress translation or induce cleavage of target mRNAs with which they
interact (Ciafre et al., 2005).

GENE FUNCTION

Using microarray analysis, Ciafre et al. (2005) found that expression of
MIR181C was significantly downregulated in primary glioblastomas and
human glioblastoma cell lines compared with normal brain tissue.

MAPPING

Ciafre et al. (2005) stated that the MIR181C gene maps to chromosome
19p13.3.

;;SGC32445;;
CHROMOSOME 5 OPEN READING FRAME 19; C5ORF19
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lai et al. (2001) identified C5ORF19, which they called SGC32445, within
a region of chromosome 5q frequently deleted in malignant myelomas. The
deduced 152-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about
17 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of about 2.2 kb.
C5ORF19 expression was abundant in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle,
low in placenta, kidney, and pancreas, and absent in lung and liver.

Transport of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the cell surface
membrane is critical for receptor-ligand recognition. However, mammalian
GPCR odorant receptors (ORs), when heterologously expressed in cells,
are poorly expressed on the cell surface. By screening for genes that
induced cell surface expression of ORs expressed in human embryonic
kidney cells, Saito et al. (2004) identified mouse and human REEP1
(609139). They searched databases for homologs of REEP1 and identified
several other REEP genes, including REEP2. In situ hybridization of
mouse olfactory epithelium revealed that, unlike Reep1, Reep2 was not
expressed in olfactory neurons.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lai et al. (2001) determined that the C5ORF19 gene contains 8 exons and
spans more than 7 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lai et al. (2001) mapped the REEP2 gene to
chromosome 5q31.

141251	TITLE *141251 HEME OXYGENASE 2; HMOX2
;;HEMOXYGENASE 2
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FUNCTION

Heme oxygenase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the heme degradative
pathway (Kutty et al., 1994). This degradative process has 2 important
products, biliverdin, the precursor of the bile pigment bilirubin, and
carbon monoxide, a putative neurotransmitter. There are 2 isozymic forms
of heme oxygenase, an inducible heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1; 141250) and a
constitutive heme oxygenase-2 (HMOX2).

Heme oxygenase-2, which synthesizes carbon monoxide (CO), has been
localized by immunohistochemistry to endothelial cells and adventitial
nerves of blood vessels. It is also localized to neurons in autonomic
ganglia, including the petrosal, superior cervical, and nodose ganglia,
as well as ganglia in the myenteric plexus of the intestine. Zakhary et
al. (1996) demonstrated by enzyme studies that tin protoporphyrin IX is
a selective inhibitor of heme oxygenase with about 10-fold selectivity
for heme oxygenase over endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3; 163729)
and soluble guanylyl cyclase. Inhibition of heme oxygenase activity by
tin protoporphyrin IX reverses the component of endothelial-derived
relaxation porcine distal pulmonary arteries not reversed by an
inhibitor of NOS. Thus, the authors concluded that CO, like nitric oxide
(NO), may have endothelial-derived relaxing activity; additionally, the
similarity of NOS and heme oxygenase-2 localizations and functions in
blood vessels and the autonomic nervous system implies complementary and
possibly coordinated physiologic roles for these 2 mediators.

Using immunoprecipitation studies, Takahashi et al. (2000) showed that
amyloid precursor protein (APP; 104760) and amyloid precursor-like
protein (APLP1; 104775) bound to HMOX1 and HMOX2 in the endoplasmic
reticulum and inhibited heme oxygenase activity by 25 to 35% in vitro.
Familial Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300)-associated APP mutations showed
greater inhibition (45 to 50%) of heme oxygenase. As heme oxygenase
shows antioxidative effects, the authors hypothesized that APP-mediated
inhibition of heme oxygenase may result in increased oxidative
neurotoxicity in AD.

Williams et al. (2004) demonstrated that hemoxygenase-2 is part of the
BK channel complex (600150) and enhances channel activity in normoxia.
Knockdown of hemoxygenase-2 expression reduced channel activity, and
carbon monoxide, a product of hemoxygenase-2 activity, rescued this loss
of function. Inhibition of BK channels by hypoxia was dependent on
hemoxygenase-2 expression and was augmented by hemoxygenase-2
stimulation. Furthermore, carotid body cells demonstrated
hemoxygenase-2-dependent hypoxic BK channel inhibition, which indicated
that hemoxygenase-2 is an oxygen sensor that controls channel activity
during oxygen deprivation.

MAPPING

Using the polymerase chain reaction for analysis of human/rodent somatic
cell hybrids, Kutty et al. (1994) assigned the HMOX2 gene to chromosome
16. They regionalized the assignment to 16p13.3 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH). By FISH, Saito-Ohara et al. (1997) mapped the
Hmox2 gene to mouse chromosome 16B1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Heme oxygenase activity leads to accumulation of the antioxidant
bilirubin, and degradation of the preoxidant heme. Moderate
overexpression of the inducible form, HMOX1, is associated with
protection against oxidative injury. To evaluate the role of HMOX2
(called HO-2 by the authors) in oxidative stress, Dennery et al. (1998)
investigated Hmox2 null 'knockout' mice exposed to more than 95% O(2)
compared with wildtype controls. Similar basal levels of lung
antioxidants were observed, except that the knockouts had a 2-fold
increase in total glutathione content. Despite increased Hmox1
expression from Hmox1 induction, knockout animals were sensitized to
hyperoxia-induced oxidative injury and mortality, and also had
significantly increased markers of oxidative injury before hyperoxic
exposure. The results suggested that Hmox2 functions to augment the
turnover of lung iron during oxidative stress, and that this function
does not appear to be compensated for by induction of Hmox1 in the
knockouts.

600756	TITLE *600756 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2, REGULATORY SUBUNIT B-PRIME; PPP2R4
;;PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2A, REGULATORY SUBUNIT B-PRIME;;
PHOSPHOTYROSYL PHOSPHATASE ACTIVATOR; PTPA;;
PR53
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PPP2R4, or PTPA, encodes a specific phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator
of the dimeric form of protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A; see 176915) (Van
Hoof et al., 1995).

GENE FUNCTION

The core component of PP2A consists of a catalytic (C) subunit (e.g.,
PPP2CA; 176915) and a scaffold protein (A) subunit (e.g., PPP2R1A;
605983). Using purified recombinant proteins, Chao et al. (2006) found
that PTPA and PP2A A-C dimers constituted a composite ATPase, and the
interaction was independent of ATP or magnesium ion. The inclusion of
PTPA altered the substrate specificity of PP2A, with enhanced
phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity and decreased phosphoserine
phosphatase activity.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Chao et al. (2006) reported the 1.9-angstrom crystal structure of human
PTPA, which revealed a fold consisting of a core, a lid, and an extended
linker joining the core and lid. Structural analysis uncovered a highly
conserved surface patch bordering these 3 subdomains, as well as an
associated deep pocket between the core and linker subdomains. Further
analysis showed that the surface patch binds the PP2A A-C dimer, and the
deep pocket binds ATP.

GENE STRUCTURE

Van Hoof et al. (1995) demonstrated that human PTPA is encoded by a
single-copy gene composed of 10 exons and 9 introns with a total length
of about 60 kb. The 5-prime flanking sequence of the transcription start
site was analyzed for its potential as a promoter. This region lacks a
TATA sequence in the appropriate position relative to the transcription
start. However, this region is very GC-rich and contains 4 Sp1 sites
(SP1; 189906) upstream of the transcription start site, a feature common
to many TATA-less promoters. Based on homology with DNA-binding
consensus sequences of transcription factors, Van Hoof et al. (1995)
identified several additional putative transcription factor binding
sites in the promoter region. Transfection experiments with a construct
containing the PTPA promoter region inserted 5-prime of a luciferase
reporter gene demonstrated that the 5-prime flanking sequence of the
PTPA gene indeed has promoter activity that seems to be cell-line
dependent.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Van Hoof et al. (1995) mapped the
PTPA gene to 9q34. Fluorescence in situ analysis of metaphase
chromosomes of patients bearing the Philadelphia chromosome indicated
that PTPA is positioned centromeric of ABL1 (189980) and probably is not
involved in chronic myeloid leukemia.
