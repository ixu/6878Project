;;FORKHEAD, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG-LIKE 5; FKHL5;;
FORKHEAD-RELATED ACTIVATOR 1; FREAC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The forkhead genes are transcription factors distinguished by a
characteristic 100-amino acid motif that was originally identified in
Drosophila (see 164874).

CLONING

Pierrou et al. (1994) identified 7 human genes containing forkhead
domains and designated them forkhead-related activators (FREAC) 1
through 7. Northern blot analysis revealed that the FREAC1, or FKHL5,
gene is expressed as a 2.6-kb mRNA in placenta and adult and fetal lung.

Hellqvist et al. (1996) reported the FREAC1 cDNA sequence. The predicted
354-amino acid protein is nearly identical to FREAC2 (FKHL6; 603250)
within a 112-residue region containing the forkhead domain and adjacent
sequences, and within the C-terminal region. Hellqvist et al. (1996)
reported that the mouse HFH8 gene and FREAC1 share 90% nucleotide
sequence identity. By resequencing of HFH8, these authors demonstrated
that 5 frameshifts in the HFH8 sequence reported by Clevidence et al.
(1994) were due to sequencing errors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Madison et al. (2009) found that the upstream region of the FOXF1 gene
contains 2 conserved GLI (see GLI1; 165220)-binding sites, as well as
MEF2 (see 600660) and forkhead consensus sites.

Szafranski et al. (2013) reported that the 5.5-kb FOXF1 promoter region,
which is located immediately upstream of the FOXF1 translation start
site, contains several GLI-binding sites and partly overlaps a long
noncoding RNA (lncRNA), FOXF1AS1 (614975), on the opposite strand. The
promoter region is located within a large CpG island that extends into
FOXF1 exon 1. Szafranski et al. (2013) also identified a 75-kb distant
regulatory region located in a region lacking protein-coding genes
between 332 and 257 kb upstream of the FOXF1 translation start site.
This region contains several sequences conserved among vertebrates,
including 2 lncRNAs, TCONS_00024764 (614977) and TCONS_00024492
(614978), a cluster of predicted binding sites for GLI1, GLI2 (165230),
and GLI3 (165240), and a CpG island. Chromosome conformation capture
analysis suggested chromatin looping between the distant regulatory
region and the FOXF1 promoter.

MAPPING

Larsson et al. (1995) mapped the FKHL5 gene to chromosome 16q24 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization and somatic cell hybrid analysis.

Madison et al. (2009) stated that mouse Foxf1 maps to a region of
chromosome 8 containing several genes encoding forkhead transcription
factors.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a reporter gene construct containing FREAC2 binding sequences in
the promoter, Hellqvist et al. (1996) demonstrated that both FREAC1 and
FREAC2 have C-terminal transcriptional activation domains. FREAC1/FREAC2
binding sequences are present in the promoters of several lung-specific
genes, including CC10 (192020) and SPB (SFTPB; 178640). While both
FREAC1 and FREAC2 transactivated an SPB promoter construct, CC10 was
activated only by FREAC1. CC10 activation occurred specifically in a
lung cell line with Clara cell-like characteristics.

Madison et al. (2009) found that expression of Foxf1 and Foxl1 (603252)
in developing mouse stomach and intestine was dependent on Gli2 (165230)
and Gli3 (165240) and was induced by an N-terminal fragment of Shh
(600725). Several highly conserved Gli-binding sites appeared crucial
for Gli-mediated binding and transcriptional activation of Foxf1 and
Foxl1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 10 patients with alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of
pulmonary veins (ACDMPV; 265380) associated with multiple congenital
anomalies, Stankiewicz et al. (2009) identified 6 overlapping
microdeletions encompassing the FOX transcription factor gene cluster,
all but 1 of which included the FOXF1 gene. By sequencing the FOXF1 gene
in 18 additional patients with ACDMPV, Stankiewicz et al. (2009)
identified heterozygosity for 1 nonsense, 1 no-stop, and 2 frameshift
mutations in 4 unrelated patients (601089.0001-601089.0004,
respectively). Stankiewicz et al. (2009) noted that in contrast to the
association of point mutations in FOXF1 with bowel malrotation,
microdeletions of FOXF1 were associated with hypoplastic left heart
syndrome and gastrointestinal atresias, which they suggested was due to
haploinsufficiency for the neighboring FOXC2 (602402) and FOXL1 (603252)
genes.

Sen et al. (2013) provided a comprehensive list of 42 identified FOXF1
variants in patients with ACDMPV. Twenty-five (60%) of the variants were
located within the putative DNA-binding domain, indicating its plausible
role in FOXF1 function. The majority of the ACDMPV cases were sporadic.
Only 4 cases were familial, of which 3 showed maternal inheritance
consistent with paternal imprinting of the gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kalinichenko et al. (2002) reported that haploinsufficiency of the Foxf1
gene caused pulmonary abnormalities with perinatal lethality from lung
hemorrhage in a subset of Foxf1 +/- newborn mice. They found that Foxf1
was expressed in embryonic septum transversum and gallbladder
mesenchyme, and that gallbladders of Foxf1 +/- mice showed severe
structural abnormalities. The Foxf1 +/- phenotype correlated with
decreased expression of Vcam1 (192225), alpha-5 integrin (135620), Pdgf
receptor-alpha (173490), and Hgf (142409), all of which are critical for
cell adhesion, migration, and mesenchymal cell differentiation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ALVEOLAR CAPILLARY DYSPLASIA WITH MISALIGNMENT OF PULMONARY VEINS
FOXF1, TYR50TER

In a male infant with congenital alveolar capillary dysplasia and
misalignment of the pulmonary veins (265380), previously reported by Sen
et al. (2004), who died on day 10 of life and was also found to have a
partial atrioventricular canal defect, patent ductus arteriosus,
intestinal malrotation, annular pancreas and duodenal stenosis,
bilateral hydronephrosis, hydroureter, and dilatation of the urinary
bladder, Stankiewicz et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a
150C-A transversion in exon 1 of the FOXF1 gene, resulting in a
tyr50-to-ter (Y50X) substitution in the forkhead box F1 domain.

.0002
ALVEOLAR CAPILLARY DYSPLASIA WITH MISALIGNMENT OF PULMONARY VEINS
FOXF1, TER355ARG

In a male infant with congenital alveolar capillary dysplasia and
misalignment of the pulmonary veins (265380), who died at 47 days of
life and was also found to have intestinal malrotation and Meckel
diverticulum, Stankiewicz et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a
1063T-C transition in exon 2 of the FOXF1 gene, resulting in a
ter355-to-arg (X355R) substitution, predicted to lengthen the protein by
73 amino acids.

.0003
ALVEOLAR CAPILLARY DYSPLASIA WITH MISALIGNMENT OF PULMONARY VEINS
FOXF1, 1-BP DUP, 775T

In a male infant with congenital alveolar capillary dysplasia and
misalignment of the pulmonary veins (265380), who died 12 hours after
birth and was also found to have obstructive renal dysplasia,
Stankiewicz et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp
duplication in exon 1 of the FOXF1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and
premature termination of the protein.

.0004
ALVEOLAR CAPILLARY DYSPLASIA WITH MISALIGNMENT OF PULMONARY VEINS
FOXF1, 2-BP DEL, 956TT

In a female infant with congenital alveolar capillary dysplasia and
misalignment of the pulmonary veins (265380), who died at 1 day of life
and who was also found to have partial anomalous pulmonary venous
connection with absence of the left upper lobe pulmonary vein,
congenital short bowel with malrotation, a small omphalocele, bilateral
severe hydronephrosis, hydroureter, and bladder dilatation, as well as
micrognathia and low-set ears, Stankiewicz et al. (2009) identified
heterozygosity for a 2-bp deletion (956delTT) in exon 2 of the FOXF1
gene, predicted to add 29 amino acids to the protein.

604231	TITLE *604231 PITUITARY TUMOR-TRANSFORMING GENE 2; PTTG2
DESCRIPTION During the course of studies mapping the PTTG1 (604147) gene to 5q33,
Prezant et al. (1999) found evidence for a related intronless gene,
which they referred to as PTTG2, on chromosome 4. They stated that PTTG1
and PTTG2 are highly conserved at both the nucleotide and amino acid
levels, including the potential SH3 binding domain. They found low-level
PTTG2 expression in normal pituitary and in some other normal tissues,
and moderately elevated expression in some pituitary tumors. By
radiation hybrid mapping, Prezant et al. (1999) mapped the PTTG2 gene to
human chromosome 4p12.

;;VEGF COREGULATED CHEMOKINE 1; VCC1;;
DENDRITIC CELL AND MONOCYTE CHEMOKINE-LIKE PROTEIN; DMC
DESCRIPTION For background information on the chemokine gene family, see CXCL10
(147310).

CLONING

Using protein fold recognition methodology, Pisabarro et al. (2006)
identified a novel chemokine that they termed DMC. The predicted
119-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 13.8 kD and
shares 71% identity with its mouse homolog. DMC has an N-terminal signal
peptide, but no N-glycosylation sites. Secondary structure analysis
showed highest similarity to CXCL8 (IL8; 146930), whereas circular
dichroism analysis revealed that active, purified DMC adopted a
secondary structure resembling that of CCL5 (187011) and CCL4 (182284).
Northern blot analysis detected expression of DMC in adult trachea and
stomach and fetal lung. Immunohistochemical analysis showed expression
of DMC in intestine and normal and asthmatic adult lung.

By microarray analysis, Weinstein et al. (2006) identified VCC1 as a
novel gene coregulated with VEGF (192240) expression in tumors and
angiogenesis models. The predicted VCC1 protein contains 2 CXC chemokine
motifs, but a hidden Markov model showed significant similarity to CCL17
(601520) and CCL16 (601394). Northern blot analysis of human tissues
detected a 1-kb transcript in lung and skeletal muscle only. Microarray
and RT-PCR analyses showed that VCC1 expression was upregulated in
breast and colon tumors. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated
expression of VCC1 in normal and transformed breast epithelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using migration assays, Pisabarro et al. (2006) showed that DMC
attracted nonactivated monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs), but not
other blood cell types. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated specific
binding of DMC to DCs and monocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Weinstein et al. (2006) determined that the VCC1 gene has 4 exons and
spans approximately 15 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Weinstein et al. (2006) mapped the VCC1
gene to chromosome 19q11.
