DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) catalyze hydrolysis of the sn-2 acyl-ester
bonds in phospholipids, leading to the release of arachidonic acid and
other fatty acids. PLA2G6 is a calcium-independent PLA2 (Forsell et al.,
1999).

CLONING

Tang et al. (1997) purified an 85-kD cytosolic calcium-independent PLA2,
termed iPLA2, from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. They isolated a
partial human cDNA from a Burkitt lymphoma cDNA library by screening
with a CHO cDNA. Northern blot analysis revealed that iPLA2 is expressed
in a variety of rodent tissues.

Larsson et al. (1998) cloned human iPLA2 cDNAs and discovered multiple
mRNA isoforms resulting from alternative splicing. The full-length cDNA
encodes an 806-amino acid protein with a lipase motif and 8 ankyrin
repeats. Human and rodent iPLA2 share 90% overall amino acid sequence
identity, with the human sequence differing in containing a 54-residue
insertion that would interrupt the last putative ankyrin repeat. Two of
the alternatively spliced forms encode only the ankyrin repeat region of
the protein. Coexpression of these variants with the active iPLA2 enzyme
resulted in a decrease of the enzyme's activity.

By computational analysis, Forsell et al. (1999) identified several
human iPLA2 variants that were alternatively spliced at exons 3, 9, 9a,
and 10a, as well as part of exon 14. Northern blot analysis detected
iPLA2 transcripts of 1.8, 2.0, 3.2, and 4.2 kb. The 2.0-kb variant was
expressed at variable levels in all tissues examined, the 3.2-kb and
4.2-kb transcripts were expressed at variable levels in most tissues
examined, and the 1.8-kb transcript was expressed predominantly in heart
and skeletal muscle, with lower levels in bone marrow. Western blot
analysis of fractionated transfected COS-7 cells showed that full-length
human iPLA2 associated with membranes. Hydropathy plot and bioinformatic
analyses suggested that iPLA2 contains 2 hydrophobic regions that may be
transmembrane domains.

Using rat iPla2 to screen a human insulinoma cDNA library, followed by
RT-PCR of human islet RNA, Ma et al. (1999) cloned long and short iPLA2
splice variants. The short variant lacks an insert encoding a 54-amino
acid proline-rich region in the long variant. This insert interrupts the
last putative ankyrin repeat and is likely to function as a linker
region that separates the N-terminal protein-binding domain from the
C-terminal catalytic domain. RT-PCR detected these 2 transcripts in a
human promonocytic cell line and in normal islet cells. SDS-PAGE showed
that the recombinant short and long isoforms of human iPLA2 had apparent
molecular masses of 85 kD and 88 kD, respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Forsell et al. (1999) determined that the PLA2G6 gene contains 19 exons,
including the alternative exons 9a and 10a, and spans more than 69 kb.
The promoter region lacks a TATA box, but contains a CpG island and
several potential SP1 (189906)-binding sites. The 5-prime flanking
region also contains an inverted MER53 sequence and an Alu element.

MAPPING

Ma et al. (1999) mapped the PLA2G6 gene to chromosome 22q13.1 by FISH.

GENE FUNCTION

Tang et al. (1997) found that expression of the hamster iPla2 cDNA
generated an active 85-kD protein that selectively hydrolyzed sn-2 over
sn-1 fatty acids.

Forsell et al. (1999) found that COS-7 cells expressing full-length
human iPLA2 and rat vascular smooth muscle cells showed
Ca(2+)-independent release of arachidonic acid from radiolabeled
phospholipids, and that the activity was associated with the membrane
fractions.

Ma et al. (1999) found that both recombinant short and long isoforms of
human iPLA2 had Ca(2+)-independent PLA2 activity in cytosolic and
membrane fractions. Their activities were inhibited by bromoenol
lactone, an iPLA2 suicide substrate. The long iPLA2 isoform, but not the
short isoform, was activated by ATP.

Turk and Ramanadham (2004) stated that the shorter iPLA2 isoforms that
lack the C-terminal catalytic domain function as negative modulators of
iPLA2-beta, the full-length isoform. They also noted that iPLA2-beta can
be proteolytically processed to yield truncated products that are
constitutively active. Turk and Ramanadham (2004) reviewed the role of
iPLA2 in phospholipid remodeling, signal transduction, cell
proliferation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis. They
stated that, in pancreatic islets, beta cells, and insulinoma cells,
iPLA2-beta participates in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, but it
is not involved in membrane phospholipid remodeling.

Arachidonic acid and its metabolites are involved in regulation of
endothelial cell proliferation. Herbert and Walker (2006) showed that
bromoenol lactone-mediated inhibition of iPLA2-VIA activity in human
endothelial cells blocked endothelial cell growth and inhibited DNA
synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. These effects were reversed upon
the exogenous addition of arachidonic acid. iPLA2-VIA activity was
required for expression of the cyclin A (see CCNA1; 604036)/CDK2
(116953) complex, and thus inhibition of iPLA2-VIA blocked S phase
progression and resulted in exit from the cell cycle. Inhibition of
iPLA2-VIA-mediated endothelial cell proliferation was sufficient to
block angiogenic tubule formation by human endothelial cells cocultured
with human dermal fibroblasts. Herbert and Walker (2006) concluded that,
by generating arachidonic acid, iPLA2-VIA regulates endothelial cell S
phase progression, cell cycle residence, and angiogenesis. They noted
that iPLA2-VIA is involved in cell growth and division in other cell
types through arachidonic acid-independent regulation of
glycerophospholipid metabolism during the cell cycle.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation 2A and 2B
and Karak Syndrome

In studies of 12 families with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD,
NBIA2A; 256600) and a large consanguineous Pakistani family with
neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA2B; 610217), Morgan
et al. (2006) mapped a novel INAD locus to 22q12.3-q13.2 (lod score
4.78), with evidence of locus heterogeneity. They also detected linkage
to 22q12-q13 in a family with NBIA (lod score 4.65) suggesting allelism.
After sequencing 70 of the approximately 100 positional candidate genes,
they detected mutations in PLA2G6 in 4 kindreds, including the Pakistani
family with NBIA2B and 3 INAD probands (603604.0001-603604.0005). They
also identified PLA2G6 mutations in 28 additional probands with INAD and
in the original family with Karak syndrome and high basal ganglia iron
(see 610217). In all, they identified 44 unique mutations (32 missense,
5 deletions leading to frameshift, 3 nonsense, 2 leading to amino acid
deletions without frameshift, 1 splice site, and 1 large deletion). Of
the missense mutations, 85% occurred at amino acid positions that are
conserved in vertebrates.

In an independent study, Khateeb et al. (2006) identified a homozygous
mutation in PLA2G6 in 2 consanguineous Israeli Bedouin kindreds with
infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (NBIA2A). The 3-bp deletion
(603604.0004) resulted in the deletion of valine-691.

Gregory et al. (2008) found PLA2G6 mutations in 45 (79%) of 56 patients
with INAD1 (NBIA2A) and in 6 (20%) of 23 patients with idiopathic NBIA2B
(see, e.g., 603604.0006-603604.0008). No PLA2G6 mutations were found in
11 patients with clinical evidence of INAD, including 5 in whom
spheroids were reported on peripheral nerve biopsy. All 28 patients with
2 null mutations or homozygous for any mutation had early onset and
rapidly progressive disease. Patients with the less severe phenotype of
NBIA tended to have compound heterozygous missense mutations, consistent
with residual protein function.

- Parkinson Disease 14

In 2 unrelated families with adult-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (PARK14;
612953), Paisan-Ruiz et al. (2009) identified 2 different homozygous
mutations in the PLA2G6 gene (R741Q; 603604.0009 and R747W; 603604.0010,
respectively). The disorder was characterized by rapidly progressive
cognitive decline, bradykinesia, rigidity, and dystonia. None of the 3
affected patients had evidence of brain iron accumulation. The authors
emphasized that PLA2G6 mutations should be considered in patients with
neurodegeneration even without brain iron on MRI scan.

ANIMAL MODEL

Bao et al. (2004) obtained Ipla2-beta-null mice at a mendelian ratio.
They found that spermatozoa from Ipla2-beta -/- mice had reduced
motility and impaired ability to fertilize mouse oocytes in vitro and in
vivo. Female Ipla2-beta -/- mice had nearly normal fertility.

Ramanadham et al. (2008) found that Ipla2-beta-null mice had cortical
bone size, trabecular bone volume, bone mineralizing surfaces, and bone
strength similar to wildtype mice at 3 months of age. Both groups showed
declines in these measures with age, but the decline was more pronounced
in Ipla2-beta-null mice. The lower bone mass in Ipla2-beta-null mice was
accompanied by an increase in bone marrow fat. Relative to wildtype
mice, undifferentiated bone marrow stromal cells from knockout mice
expressed higher levels of Pparg (601487) and lower levels of Runx2
(600211) mRNA, and these changes correlated with increased adipogenesis
and decreased osteogenesis in bone marrow stromal cells in knockout
mice.

Malik et al. (2008) found that Pla2g6-null mice developed age-dependent
neurologic impairment that was evident in rotarod, balance, and climbing
tests by 13 months of age. Neuropathologic analysis showed numerous
spheroids in the brain similar to those observed in human INAD.
Spheroids contained tubulovesicular membranes and stained strongly with
anti-ubiquitin antibodies. Onset of motor impairment correlated with
increased spheroids throughout the neuropil in nearly all brain regions.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEURODEGENERATION WITH BRAIN IRON ACCUMULATION 2A
PLA2G6, TYR790TER

In a proband with classic infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (256600),
Morgan et al. (2006) identified a 2370T-G transversion in exon 17 of the
PLA2G6 gene that was predicted to result in a premature termination in
the protein (tyr790 to stop; Y790X). The parents were known to be
consanguineous and the mutation was present in homozygous state. The
presence of spheroids had been demonstrated.

NEURODEGENERATION WITH BRAIN IRON ACCUMULATION 2B
PLA2G6, LYS545THR

In a large consanguineous Pakistani family with neurodegeneration with
brain iron accumulation-2B (NBIA2B; 610217), Morgan et al. (2006)
identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in exon 12 of the PLA2G6
gene, a 1634A-C transversion that resulted in a lys545-to-thr
substitution (K545T).

.0003
NEURODEGENERATION WITH BRAIN IRON ACCUMULATION 2A
PLA2G6, VAL310GLU

In a case of classic infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (256600), Morgan et
al. (2006) described a 929T-A transversion in exon 7 of the PLA2G6 gene,
predicted to result in a val310-to-glu (V310E) amino acid change in the
protein. The mutation was present in homozygous state.

.0004
NEURODEGENERATION WITH BRAIN IRON ACCUMULATION 2A
PLA2G6, 2-BP DEL, 2070TGT

In a case of classic infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (256600), Morgan et
al. (2006) found a 3-bp deletion in exon 15 of the PLA2G6 gene,
2070_2072delTGT, resulting in deletion of val691 from the protein
(V691del). The mutation was present in homozygous state, or possibly
hemizygous state because of deletion of 1 allele.

In a consanguineous Bedouin kindred with cases of infantile neuroaxonal
dystrophy in 3 separate sibships and in another kindred with a single
affected individual, Khateeb et al. (2006) found the same 3-nucleotide
deletion. The mutation was also found in heterozygosity in a single
individual among 300 unrelated Bedouin controls. Both affected families
and the unrelated carrier had the same haplotype surrounding the
mutation.

.0005
KARAK SYNDROME
PLA2G6, ARG632TRP

In the original family with Karak syndrome (see 610217), Morgan et al.
(2006) detected homozygosity for a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1894
in exon 14 of the PLA2G6 gene that resulted in a substitution of trp for
arg at codon 632 (R632W).

.0006
NEURODEGENERATION WITH BRAIN IRON ACCUMULATION 2A
PLA2G6, TYR790TER

In 4 patients with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (256600), Gregory et
al. (2008) identified a homozygous 2370T-G transversion in the PLA2G6
gene, resulting in a tyr790-to-ter (Y790X) substitution. The INAD1
phenotype was characterized by early onset of psychomotor regression
with truncal hypotonia and rapid progression to tetraparesis.

PLA2G6, 2-BP DEL, 2370TG

Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation 2A

In a patient with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (256600), Gregory et
al. (2008) identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion (2370delTG) in the
PLA2G6 gene, which resulted in premature termination at codon 790
similar to the Y790X mutation (603604.0006).

Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation 2B

In a patient with NBIA2B (610217), Gregory et al. (2008) identified
compound heterozygosity for the 2370delTG mutation and a 238G-A
transition, resulting in an ala80-to-thr (A80T; 603604.0007)
substitution. The patient presented at 3 years of age with toe walking
and lower extremity spasticity. She developed optic atrophy and became
nonambulatory by 5 years of age with dystonia and dysarthria,
progressing to profound sensorimotor impairment by age 9 years. She died
at age 23 years. Postmortem examination showed neuronal loss, axonal
swelling, and Lewy bodies and neurofibrillary tangles.

PARKINSON DISEASE 14
PLA2G6, ARG741GLN

In 2 affected first cousins from a large consanguineous Indian kindred
segregating adult-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (PARK14; 612953),
Paisan-Ruiz et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 2222G-A transition in
the PLA2G6 gene, resulting in an arg741-to-gln (R741Q) substitution in a
conserved residue. Both had onset at age 26 years of a rapidly
progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by rapid cognitive
decline, bradykinesia, tremor and imbalance, eventually leading to loss
of mobility. Although Paisan-Ruiz et al. (2009) noted that brain MRI
showed no evidence of brain iron accumulation, Gregory et al. (2009)
stated that this disorder could be considered under the umbrella
designation of atypical neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation
(NBIA).

.0010
PARKINSON DISEASE 14
PLA2G6, ARG747TRP

In a Pakistani man, born of consanguineous parents, with adult-onset
dystonia-parkinsonism (612953), Paisan-Ruiz et al. (2009) identified a
homozygous 2239C-T transition in the PLA2G6 gene, resulting in an
arg747-to-trp (R747W) substitution in a conserved region. The patient
had onset at age 18 years of rapid cognitive decline with personality
changes, foot dystonia, parkinsonism, and spasticity. Although
Paisan-Ruiz et al. (2009) noted that brain MRI showed no evidence of
brain iron accumulation, Gregory et al. (2009) stated that this disorder
could be considered under the umbrella designation of atypical
neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA).

.0011
PARKINSON DISEASE 14
PLA2G6, ARG635GLN

In 3 Japanese patients, including 2 sibs, with early-onset Parkinson
disease-14 (612953), Yoshino et al. (2010) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PLA2G6 gene. All 3 patients
carried a 1904G-A transition, resulting in an arg635-to-gln (R635Q)
substitution in the catalytic domain. The 2 sibs also had a heterozygous
1354C-T transition, resulting in a gln452-to-ter (Q452X; 603604.0012)
substitution, and the third unrelated patient had a heterozygous 216C-A
transversion, resulting in a phe72-to-leu (F72L; 603604.0013)
substitution. Haplotype analysis suggested a founder effect for the
R635Q mutation. All 3 patients had onset before age 30 years of
L-dopa-responsive parkinsonism with varying degrees of cognitive decline
and frontotemporal lobar atrophy. Brain MRI of 1 patient showed iron
accumulation in the substantia nigra and striatum. None of the parents
with heterozygous mutations had signs of the disorder.

PLA2G6, 6.6-KB DEL

In a patient with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (256600), Tonelli et
al. (2010) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
PLA2G6 gene: a 6.6-kb deletion from intron 4 to 6, resulting in an
in-frame deletion and removal of exons 5 and 6 and a large portion of
the ankyrin repeats motif, and a 109C-T transition in exon 2 resulting
in an arg37-to-ter (R37X; 603604.0015) substitution. Analysis of the
deletion junction in the first mutation showed that both breakpoints
occurred within AluY sequences, suggesting that the deletion was likely
mediated by nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR). The mutations
were predicted to result in an almost complete lack of enzyme activity,
although a gain of function could not be excluded. The patient had a
severe and rapidly progressive disease course, with onset before age 12
months, hypotonia, severe developmental delay with mental retardation,
and no eye contact. Spastic tetraparesis developed by age 18 months.
Skin biopsy showed axonal spheroids. Although brain iron accumulation
was not present, MRI at age 20 months showed hyperintensities on
T2-weighted imaging in the caudate and putamen, suggesting an early
degeneration process. Brain MRI at age 3 years showed cerebellar
cortical atrophy.

PARKINSON DISEASE 14
PLA2G6, ASP331TYR

In a Chinese man, born of consanguineous parents, with early-onset
Parkinson disease (612953), Shi et al. (2011) identified a homozygous
991G-T transversion in the PLA2G6 gene, resulting in an asp331-to-tyr
(D331Y) substitution. The mutation was not found in 300 control
individuals. The patient developed foot dragging and difficulty walking
at age 37 years. Symptoms progressed to include masked facies,
bradykinesia, and rigidity, but no atypical features. He had initial
good response to L-dopa treatment, but developed dyskinesias. Brain MRI
excluded iron deposition. PET scan showed significant reduction in DAT
binding in the basal ganglia. In vitro functional expression studies in
HEK293 cells showed that the mutant PLA2G6 protein had about 30%
residual activity. The patient's clinically unaffected 34-year-old
sister was also homozygous for the mutation, and PET scan showed some
loss of binding. The patient was identified in a cohort of 12 Chinese
families with early-onset parkinsonism who were screened for PLA2G6
mutations; none of the other 11 families carried a PLA2G6 mutation.

604472	TITLE *604472 TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR LIGAND SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 13; TNFSF13
;;APRIL;;
TNF- AND APOL-RELATED LEUKOCYTE EXPRESSED LIGAND 2; TALL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of ligands play
important roles in various physiologic and pathologic processes,
including cell proliferation, differentiation, and death, and modulation
of immune responses. By screening EST databases, Hahne et al. (1998)
cloned a novel TNF cDNA, TNFSF13, which they called APRIL, for 'a
proliferation-inducing ligand.' The full-length cDNA TNFSF13 clone
encodes a 250-amino acid protein with a predicted 28-amino acid
cytoplasmic domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and an
extracellular domain of 201 amino acids with no signal peptide. There is
only 1 N-linked glycosylation site. The sequence of the extracellular
domain shows 21% homology with TNFSF6 (134638) and 20% homology with
TNFA (191160). Northern blot analysis revealed weak expression
restricted to a few tissues: transcripts of 2.1 and 2.4 kb in prostate
and a transcript of 1.8 kb in peripheral blood leukocytes. All tumor
cell lines, however, strongly expressed the TNFSF13 2.1-kb transcript,
and expression of extracellular or full-length TNFSF13 led to increased
proliferation of various cell lines.

Shu et al. (1999) identified the same gene, which they designated TALL2.
TALL2 shares about 35% sequence identity with TALL1 (BLYS, or TNFSF13B;
603969) in the C terminus.

By RACE, RT-PCR, and screening of a T-cell cDNA library, Pradet-Balade
et al. (2002) isolated a hybrid transcript formed by intergenic splicing
of exons 1 through 6 of TWEAK (TNFSF12; 602695) to exons 2 through 6 of
APRIL. See 602695 for further information on the protein encoded by the
TWEAK/APRIL transcript, which Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) called
TWEPRIL.

Using Northern blot analysis, Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) found that
relative expression of the 1.9-kb APRIL transcript was about 6-fold
higher than that of the 2.5-kb TWEPRIL transcript in resting T cells.
However, in activated T cells, both transcripts were expressed at
similar levels. A similar expression pattern for APRIL and TWEPRIL was
detected in CD4 (186940)-positive and CD8 (see 186910)-positive T-cell
subpopulations. TWEAK expression was similar between resting and
activated T cells. TWEAK was found predominantly in ribosome-free
fractions in both resting and activated T cells, whereas APRIL and
TWEPRIL increased their association with polyribosomes following T-cell
activation, suggesting that translational efficiency of APRIL and
TWEPRIL increases upon T-cell activation.

GENE FUNCTION

Seyler et al. (2005) analyzed synovial tissue specimens from 72 patients
with rheumatoid arthritis (180300) for TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B production
and TNFSF13/TNFSF13B receptor expression. Synovitis with ectopic
germinal centers present had the highest levels of TNFSF13, produced
exclusively by CD83 (604534)-positive dendritic cells; TNFSF13B was
present in similar levels in all types of synovitis (with or without
germinal centers or T cell-B cell aggregates) and was produced
exclusively from CD68 (153634)-positive macrophages. In synovitis with
germinal centers, inhibiting TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B with a TACI
(TNFRSF13B; 604907):Fc fusion protein resulted in destruction of the
germinal centers and marked inhibition of IFN-gamma (147570) and Ig
transcription, whereas similar inhibition in the aggregate and diffuse
types of synovitis enhanced IFN-gamma production and did not affect Ig
levels. These differential immunomodulatory effects correlated with the
presence of TACI-positive T cells in aggregate and diffuse synovitis and
their absence in synovitis with germinal centers. Seyler et al. (2005)
proposed that TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B regulate B-cell as well as T-cell
function and have both pro- and antiinflammatory effects in rheumatoid
arthritis.

Both BLYS and APRIL have been described as homotrimeric molecules, a
feature common to many members of the TNF superfamily. Using ELISA
analysis, Roschke et al. (2002) found that patients with systemic lupus
erythematosus (152700), rheumatoid arthritis, Reiter syndrome, psoriatic
arthritis (see 607507), polymyositis (see 160750), and ankylosing
spondylitis (106300) had significantly higher levels of BLYS/APRIL
heterotrimers than did controls. Roschke et al. (2002) proposed that
BLYS/APRIL heterotrimers may play a role in rheumatic and other
autoimmune diseases, and that other members of the TNF ligand
superfamily may also form active soluble heterotrimers.

Using cell-based, biochemical, and structural studies, Hymowitz et al.
(2005) characterized interactions between APRIL and TACI. They found
that the short isoform of human TACI, which lacks cysteine-rich domain-1
(CRD1), was still functional for signaling and that CRD2 of TACI was
sufficient for high-affinity binding to either murine April or human
BAFF (TNFSF13B). The solution structure of CRD2 of TACI revealed a
compact domain and additional ligand-binding determinants. Cocrystal
structures of murine April bound to CRD2 of human TACI or to human BCMA
(TNFRSF17; 109545) showed large interfaces and revealed key differences
that likely influence ligand-binding affinity and specificity.

Ingold et al. (2005) showed that the TNF homology domain of mouse and
human APRIL bound BCMA and TACI, whereas a basic sequence (QKQKKQ) close
to the N terminus of the mature protein bound negatively charged
sulfated glycosaminoglycan side chains of proteoglycans. Although T-cell
lines bound little APRIL, ectopic expression of glycosaminoglycan-rich
syndecans (see SDC1; 186355) or glypicans (see GPC1; 600395) conferred
on these cells a high binding capacity that was completely dependent on
the N-terminal basic sequence of APRIL. Moreover, SDC1-positive plasma
cells and proteoglycan-rich nonhematopoietic cells displayed high
specific, heparin-sensitive binding to APRIL. Inhibition of BAFF and
APRIL, but not BAFF alone, prevented survival and/or migration of newly
formed plasma cells to bone marrow. In addition, costimulation of B-cell
proliferation by APRIL was only effective upon APRIL oligomerization.
Ingold et al. (2005) proposed that APRIL binding to the extracellular
matrix or to proteoglycan-positive cells induces APRIL oligomerization,
which is the prerequisite for triggering TACI- and/or BCMA-mediated
activation, migration, and survival signals.

Using flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and immunohistochemical
analysis, Huard et al. (2008) found that APRIL was expressed on
recruited neutrophils and accumulated on subepithelial heparan sulfate
proteoglycans in upper (e.g., tonsils) and lower (e.g., lamina propria)
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and contributed to survival of
plasma cells. Mice lacking April had less-persistent mucosal humoral
immunity. Huard et al. (2008) proposed that inflammation-recruited
neutrophils may create plasma cell niches in MALT to sustain local
antibody production.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the TNFSF13 gene contains 6
exons.

MAPPING

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the transcriptional start
site of the TNFSF13 gene lies 878 bp downstream of the TNFSF12 gene on
chromosome 17p13.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

By treating mice with TACI-Ig, Gross et al. (2001) determined that BLYS
and APRIL are required for the development of both transitional (T2) and
mature B lymphocytes. TACI-Ig-treated mice also had less circulating
immunoglobulin and produced less collagen-specific antibody. TACI-Ig
treatment inhibited the development of collagen-induced rheumatoid
arthritis. Gross et al. (2001) proposed that TACI-Ig may have a role in
both the prevention and treatment of autoimmune disease mediated by
pathogenic autoantibodies.

Stein et al. (2002) created mice expressing human APRIL as a transgene
in T cells. These mice appeared normal. Transgenic T cells showed
enhanced survival in vitro and enhanced survival of staphylococcal
enterotoxin B-reactive Cd4-positive T cells in vivo, and both of these
responses correlated with elevated Bcl2 levels. Analysis of humoral
responses to T cell-dependent antigens in the transgenic mice indicated
that APRIL affected IgM responses, but not IgG responses. In contrast, T
cell-independent type-2 (TI-2) humoral responses were enhanced in APRIL
transgenic mice. As TACI had been reported to be indispensable for TI-2
antibody formation, Stein et al. (2002) concluded that APRIL-TACI
interactions have a role in generating the TI-2 response and that APRIL
is involved in the induction and/or maintenance of T- and B-cell
responses.

To investigate the role of APRIL in immunity, Castigli et al. (2004)
generated April-deficient mice. April -/- mice had normal T and B
lymphocyte development, normal T and B cell proliferation in vitro, but
increased numbers of CD4+ effector/memory T cells and increased IgG
responses to T-dependent antigens. Serum IgA levels were significantly
decreased, and serum IgA antibody responses to mucosal immunization with
T-dependent antigens and to type 1 T-independent antigens were impaired
in April -/- mice. The results suggested that APRIL downregulates T
cell-dependent antibody responses and promotes IgA class switching.

;;KALLIKREIN 7;;
PROTEASE, SERINE, 6; PRSS6;;
STRATUM CORNEUM CHYMOTRYPTIC ENZYME; SCCE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KLK7 belongs to the kallikrein subfamily of serine proteases, which are
involved in a variety of enzymatic processes (Gan et al., 2000).

CLONING

The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis, i.e., the
stratified squamous epithelium lining the body surface. The cells of the
stratum corneum, the corneocytes, represent the end stage of the
epidermal differentiation process. Corneocytes are highly resistant
anucleated cells mainly consisting of keratin filaments surrounded by a
crosslinked protein envelope. The mechanical resistance of the stratum
corneum is dependent on the cohesion between individual corneocytes,
which is mediated to a major extent by modified desmosomes. Since a
fraction of epidermal cells continuously leaves the proliferating basal
layer and goes through differentiation, there is a continuous de novo
production of corneocytes. This is balanced to give a constant and
well-regulated stratum corneum thickness by cell shedding at the skin
surface in a process called desquamation. Desquamation means elimination
of stratum corneum cell cohesion in superficial cell layers. It has been
established that proteolysis of intercellular cohesive structures is of
major importance in the series of events preceding desquamation. Stratum
corneum chymotryptic enzyme (SCCE), or kallikrein-7 (KLK7), is a serine
proteinase with an inhibitor profile, pH dependence, and tissue
localization compatible with a role in desquamation. Egelrud (1993)
purified SCCE from human plantar corneocytes. SDS-PAGE indicated that
the purified preparation contained 1 major component with an apparent
molecular mass of 25 kD and 1 minor component with a slightly higher
apparent molecular mass. Both of these components were associated with
chymotrypsin-like activity, although SCCE differed significantly from
bovine chymotrypsin, human cathepsin G (116830), and human mast cell
chymases (see 118938) in its relative activity toward various substrates
and in its inhibitor profile. Hansson et al. (1994) sequenced the
N-terminal region of the native SCCE enzyme. By screening a human
keratinocyte cDNA library with a degenerate oligonucleotide based on the
amino acid sequence of SCCE, they isolated 2 forms of SCCE cDNA that
differed only in the 3-prime untranslated region. The predicted
253-amino acid protein consists of a 22-amino acid signal peptide and a
7-amino acid propeptide followed by the active enzyme. SCCE contains the
conserved active site regions of serine proteinases and a potential
N-glycosylation site. The amino acid sequence homology between SCCE and
human chymotrypsin, cathepsin G, and mast cell chymase, all of which
have chymotryptic activity, did not exceed 40%. Hansson et al. (1994)
demonstrated that SCCE is heterogenously glycosylated. Northern blot
analysis detected 1.2- and 2.0-kb SCCE transcripts in human skin.
Abundant SCCE mRNA expression was restricted to skin, with very low
levels of expression found in brain and kidney. Immunohistochemical
analyses had shown that the SCCE protein is present in high suprabasal
keratinocytes in the epidermis and in the keratinizing inner root sheet
of the hair follicle (Sondell et al., 1994). In the human oral cavity,
only suprabasal keratinocytes at sites where a stratum corneum is formed
contained SCCE.

Yousef et al. (2000) noted the presence of 12 cysteine residues in KLK7,
10 of which are conserved in all serine proteases, and 2 of which are
also found in other KLK proteins. RT-PCR analysis revealed expression
primarily in brain, mammary gland, cerebellum, spinal cord, kidney, and
skin, with lower levels or none detected in other tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Yousef et al. (2000) observed the upregulation of KLK7 expression in a
breast cancer cell in response to estrogens and glucocorticoids.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Yousef et al. (2000) determined that the
KLK7 gene contains 6 exons, 5 of which are coding. The gene spans 6 kb.

MAPPING

By computational analysis, Yousef et al. (2000) mapped the KLK7 gene to
chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4 between KLK6 (602652) and KLK8 (605644).

;;snoRNA, HBI-61
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs involved in RNA
processing. Box H/ACA snoRNAs, such as SNORA81, direct the conversion of
uridine to pseudouridine at specific residues of ribosomal RNAs or small
nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (Gu et al., 2005).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of human blood total RNA, Gu et al. (2005) identified several
box H/ACA snoRNAs, including SNORA81, which they called HBI-61. HBI-61
contains 178 nucleotides and has 3 isoforms.

MAPPING

Gu et al. (2005) mapped the SNORA81 gene to chromosome 3, within intron
3 of the EIF2A gene (609234).

125305	TITLE *125305 ERYTHROCYTE MEMBRANE PROTEIN BAND 4.9; EPB49
;;DEMATIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dematin, or EPB49, is an actin-bundling protein originally identified in
the erythroid membrane skeleton. Its actin-bundling activity is
abolished upon phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and is
restored after dephosphorylation (Rana et al., 1993).

CLONING

Chishti et al. (1989) proposed the name dematin (from the Greek 'dema,'
a bundle) for an actin-bundling protein identified in the human
erythroid membrane skeleton. Rana et al. (1993) noted that dematin
consists of 2 polypeptide chains of 48 and 52 kD that were identified as
protein 4.9 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. In solution, dematin exists as a
trimer and bundles actin filaments in a phosphorylation-dependent
manner. Rana et al. (1993) cloned dematin from a human reticulocyte cDNA
library. The deduced 383-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 43 kD. Dematin has a polyglutamine motif that may constitute a
nuclear localization signal, a PEST sequence, a C-terminal domain highly
similar to the C-terminal headpiece domain of villin (VIL; 193040), and
several putative phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected
variable dematin expression in all tissues examined. Immunofluorescence
microscopy revealed punctate dematin staining around the cell nucleus in
cultured human erythroblasts.

Although dematin is an actin-bundling protein of the erythroid membrane
skeleton, it is abundantly expressed in human brain, heart, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and lung. Azim et al. (1995) reported the primary
structure of the 52-kD subunit of dematin, which differs from the 48-kD
subunit by a 22-amino acid insertion within its headpiece domain. A
unique feature of the insertion sequence of the 52-kD subunit is its
homology to erythrocyte protein 4.2 (177070).

GENE FUNCTION

Rana et al. (1993) confirmed that purified human dematin possessed
actin-bundling activity in vitro. Protease treatment and microsequencing
revealed that the C-terminal headpiece domain bound actin filaments, but
it did not have actin-bundling activity.

Azim et al. (1996) demonstrated that dematin and protein 4.2 bound ATP.

Gilligan and Bennett (1993) provided a review.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid panels and fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Azim et al. (1995) localized the dematin gene to chromosome 8p21.1, a
site distal to the locus of ankyrin (612641) at chromosome 8p11.2.

Peters et al. (1995) demonstrated that the murine dematin gene,
symbolized Epb4.9, maps to chromosome 14. They raised the possibility
that dematin mutations may be involved in neurologic abnormalities in
the mouse.

ANIMAL MODEL

By using homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells, Khanna
et al. (2002) deleted the headpiece domain of dematin to evaluate its
function in vivo. Dematin headpiece-null mice were viable and born at
the expected mendelian ratio. Hematologic evaluation showed evidence of
compensated anemia and spherocytosis in these mice, however. The
headpiece-null erythrocytes were osmotically fragile, and displayed
reduced deformability and filterability. In vitro, significantly greater
membrane fragmentation of these erythrocytes was demonstrated.
Biochemical characterization showed a weakened membrane skeleton
evidenced by reduced association of spectrin and actin to the plasma
membrane. Together, these results provided evidence for the physiologic
significance of dematin and demonstrated a role for the headpiece domain
in the maintenance of structural integrity and mechanical properties of
red cells in vivo.

Chen et al. (2007) created double-knockout mice lacking beta-adducin
(ADD2; 102681) and the headpiece domain of dematin. Double-knockout pups
were pale compared with wildtype pups, but otherwise they appeared
grossly normal. Peripheral blood analysis showed severe hemolytic anemia
with reduced number of erythrocytes/hematocrit/hemoglobin and an
approximately 12-fold increase in the number of circulating
reticulocytes. The presence of a variety of misshapen and fragmented
erythrocytes correlated with increased osmotic fragility and reduced in
vivo life span. Mutant erythrocyte membranes showed weak retention of
spectrin-actin complexes, increased grain size, decreased filament
number, and features consistent with the presence of large protein
aggregates. Chen et al. (2007) concluded that dematin and adducin are

142810	TITLE *142810 HISTIDYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE; HARS
;;HRS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HARS catalyzes the covalent ligation of histidine to its cognate tRNA as
an early step in protein biosynthesis (O'Hanlon and Miller, 2002).

CLONING

O'Hanlon et al. (1995) noted that HARS and HARS2 (600783), which they
called HO3, are oriented in a head-to-head configuration and share a
bidirectional promoter. They reported that the deduced 509-amino acid
HARS protein shares 72% amino acid identity with HARS2. Both proteins
contain 3 motifs conserved among class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and
2 signature regions of histidyl-tRNA synthetases. However, HARS and
HARS2 have divergent N-terminal domains that are encoded by the first 2
exons of each gene. HARS has a calculated molecular mass of 57.4 kD.
Northern blot analysis detected a 2.0-kb HARS transcript that was highly
expressed in heart, brain, liver, and kidney.

Using 5-prime RACE with a human kidney cDNA library, O'Hanlon and Miller
(2002) identified several HARS transcripts that differed only in the
lengths of their 5-prime UTRs. O'Hanlon and Miller (2002) noted that
pufferfish and human HARS proteins share 84% amino acid homology,
suggesting a high degree of conservation.

GENE STRUCTURE

O'Hanlon and Miller (2002) determined that the HARS gene contains 13
exons and spans approximately 17.4 kb. The HARS and HARS2 genes share a
bidirectional promoter that lacks TATA and CAAT boxes. Both genes use
multiple transcriptional start sites. HARS also uses a second, more
distal promoter that overlaps the first exons of the HARS2 gene.

MAPPING

Carlock et al. (1985) used a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line with
mutations in 3 genes, HARS, RPS14 (130620) and CHR (118840), in
interspecies cell hybridization experiments, to assign the HARS gene to
chromosome 5. Wasmuth and Carlock (1986) assigned the HARS gene to
chromosome 5 by use of human-Chinese hamster ovary cell hybrids.

By genomic sequence analysis, O'Hanlon and Miller (2002) mapped the HARS
and HARS2 genes to chromosome 5q31.3. HARS and HARS2 exhibit a
head-to-head orientation, with 344 bp separating their ORFs.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 patients from Old Order Amish families in Pennsylvania with Usher
syndrome type III mapping to chromosome 5q (USH3B; 614504), Puffenberger
et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the
HARS gene (Y454S; 142810.0001) that was not found in dbSNP 129 or the
1000 Genomes Project. In addition, an Old Order Amish patient from an
unrelated deme in Ontario, Canada, had an identical phenotype and was
homozygous for the same mutation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIB
HARS, TYR454SER

In 2 patients from Old Order Amish families in Pennsylvania with Usher
syndrome type IIIB (USH3B; 614504), Puffenberger et al. (2012)
identified homozygosity for a 1361A-C transversion in the HARS gene,
resulting in a tyr454-to-ser (Y454S) substitution in the interface
between the catalytic domain and the anticodon binding domain. A patient
with an identical phenotype from an unrelated Old Order Amish deme in
Ontario, Canada, was also homozygous for the Y454S mutation. The variant
was not found in dbSNP 129 or the 1000 Genomes Project; it was, however,
detected in 7 of 406 Old Order Amish alleles, for a population-specific
allele frequency of 1.72%. (Puffenberger (2012) stated that the correct
population-specific allele frequency data appear in Table 4;
corresponding data in the text are incorrect.)

.0002
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
HARS, ARG137GLN (dbSNP rs191391414)

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to a peripheral neuropathy has not been confirmed.

In a 64-year-old man with a 15-year history of impaired sensation in the
lower extremities and electrophysiologic studies suggestive of an axonal
peripheral neuropathy, Vester et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous
410G-A transition (dbSNP rs191391414) in the HARS gene, resulting in an
arg137-to-gln (R137Q) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
catalytic core of the enzyme. The patient was ascertained from a larger
cohort of 363 individuals with peripheral neuropathy. The R137Q variant
was also found in 3 of over 13,000 control chromosomes. One of the
control carriers had no evidence of neuropathy at age 57 years.
Generation of a yeast strain with deletion of the Hst1 gene (the
ortholog of HARS) showed that the R137Q variant could not complement the
Hst1 deletion, suggesting that it is a loss-of-function allele.
Expression of the R137Q variant specifically in GABA motor nerves of C.
elegans caused gross morphologic defects in commissural axons, with
failure to reach the dorsal nerve cord, axonal beading, defasciculation,
and breaks in the nerve cord. The animals with the variant also showed
locomotor defects. Vester et al. (2013) concluded that the HARS R137Q
variant may be a pathogenic allele that predisposes to the development
of peripheral neuropathy, similar to other ARS mutations (see, e.g.,
GARS, 600287), but noted that a causal link remains unclear.

MICRO RNA 409-3p, INCLUDED; MIR409-3p, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNA molecules of about 22 nucleotides
that play important roles in gene regulation. The MIR409 precursor
stem-loop sequence encodes 2 mature miRNAs, MIR409-5p and MIR409-3p,
from its 5-prime and 3-prime ends, respectively (Altuvia et al., 2005).

CLONING

By database and sequence analysis, Altuvia et al. (2005) identified
MIR409-5p and MIR409-3p, which lie on the 5-prime and 3-prime ends,
respectively, of the MIR409 precursor stem-loop structure. They cloned
MIR409-5p from a pituitary gland cDNA library and MIR409-3p from a
neuroblastoma cDNA library.

GENE FUNCTION

By screening an miRNA library, Fort et al. (2010) identified MIR409-3p
among a small group of miRNAs that reduced production of fibrinogen (see
FGB; 134830) in HuH7 human hepatoma cells. Luciferase assays showed that
MIR409-3p specifically lowered FGB mRNA levels via a target site in the
FGB mRNA 3-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Altuvia et al. (2005) mapped the MIR409
gene within a miRNA cluster on chromosome 14 that includes MIR369
(611794).

Gross (2011) mapped the MIR409 gene to chromosome 14q32.31 based on an
alignment of the MIR409 stem-loop sequence
(UGGUACUCGGGGAGAGGUUACCCGAGCAACUUUGCAUCUGGACGACGAAUGUUGCUCGGUGAACCCCUUUUCGGUAUCA)
with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

141251	TITLE *141251 HEME OXYGENASE 2; HMOX2
;;HEMOXYGENASE 2
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FUNCTION

Heme oxygenase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the heme degradative
pathway (Kutty et al., 1994). This degradative process has 2 important
products, biliverdin, the precursor of the bile pigment bilirubin, and
carbon monoxide, a putative neurotransmitter. There are 2 isozymic forms
of heme oxygenase, an inducible heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1; 141250) and a
constitutive heme oxygenase-2 (HMOX2).

Heme oxygenase-2, which synthesizes carbon monoxide (CO), has been
localized by immunohistochemistry to endothelial cells and adventitial
nerves of blood vessels. It is also localized to neurons in autonomic
ganglia, including the petrosal, superior cervical, and nodose ganglia,
as well as ganglia in the myenteric plexus of the intestine. Zakhary et
al. (1996) demonstrated by enzyme studies that tin protoporphyrin IX is
a selective inhibitor of heme oxygenase with about 10-fold selectivity
for heme oxygenase over endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3; 163729)
and soluble guanylyl cyclase. Inhibition of heme oxygenase activity by
tin protoporphyrin IX reverses the component of endothelial-derived
relaxation porcine distal pulmonary arteries not reversed by an
inhibitor of NOS. Thus, the authors concluded that CO, like nitric oxide
(NO), may have endothelial-derived relaxing activity; additionally, the
similarity of NOS and heme oxygenase-2 localizations and functions in
blood vessels and the autonomic nervous system implies complementary and
possibly coordinated physiologic roles for these 2 mediators.

Using immunoprecipitation studies, Takahashi et al. (2000) showed that
amyloid precursor protein (APP; 104760) and amyloid precursor-like
protein (APLP1; 104775) bound to HMOX1 and HMOX2 in the endoplasmic
reticulum and inhibited heme oxygenase activity by 25 to 35% in vitro.
Familial Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300)-associated APP mutations showed
greater inhibition (45 to 50%) of heme oxygenase. As heme oxygenase
shows antioxidative effects, the authors hypothesized that APP-mediated
inhibition of heme oxygenase may result in increased oxidative
neurotoxicity in AD.

Williams et al. (2004) demonstrated that hemoxygenase-2 is part of the
BK channel complex (600150) and enhances channel activity in normoxia.
Knockdown of hemoxygenase-2 expression reduced channel activity, and
carbon monoxide, a product of hemoxygenase-2 activity, rescued this loss
of function. Inhibition of BK channels by hypoxia was dependent on
hemoxygenase-2 expression and was augmented by hemoxygenase-2
stimulation. Furthermore, carotid body cells demonstrated
hemoxygenase-2-dependent hypoxic BK channel inhibition, which indicated
that hemoxygenase-2 is an oxygen sensor that controls channel activity
during oxygen deprivation.

MAPPING

Using the polymerase chain reaction for analysis of human/rodent somatic
cell hybrids, Kutty et al. (1994) assigned the HMOX2 gene to chromosome
16. They regionalized the assignment to 16p13.3 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH). By FISH, Saito-Ohara et al. (1997) mapped the
Hmox2 gene to mouse chromosome 16B1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Heme oxygenase activity leads to accumulation of the antioxidant
bilirubin, and degradation of the preoxidant heme. Moderate
overexpression of the inducible form, HMOX1, is associated with
protection against oxidative injury. To evaluate the role of HMOX2
(called HO-2 by the authors) in oxidative stress, Dennery et al. (1998)
investigated Hmox2 null 'knockout' mice exposed to more than 95% O(2)
compared with wildtype controls. Similar basal levels of lung
antioxidants were observed, except that the knockouts had a 2-fold
increase in total glutathione content. Despite increased Hmox1
expression from Hmox1 induction, knockout animals were sensitized to
hyperoxia-induced oxidative injury and mortality, and also had
significantly increased markers of oxidative injury before hyperoxic
exposure. The results suggested that Hmox2 functions to augment the
turnover of lung iron during oxidative stress, and that this function
does not appear to be compensated for by induction of Hmox1 in the
knockouts.

;;PROTEASE INHIBITOR 6; PI6;;
PLACENTAL THROMBIN INHIBITOR; PTI;;
SPI3, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; SPI3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Coughlin et al. (1993) described a cDNA encoding a serine proteinase
inhibitor present in placental tissue and in the cytosolic fraction of
the leukemic cell line K562. On the basis of its interaction with
thrombin, through which it was discovered, the inhibitor was
operationally named the placental thrombin inhibitor (PTI). Amino acid
sequence comparisons suggested that its reactive center is located at
arg341 and cys342, that it lacks a classic N-terminal signal sequence,
and that it has the highest degree of similarity to intracellular serine
proteinase inhibitors (serpins), such as the human monocyte/neutrophil
elastase inhibitor (ELANH2; 130135). Analysis of human tissue mRNA
indicated that PTI is expressed widely, with the highest levels in
cardiac and skeletal muscle and placenta. Coughlin et al. (1993)
concluded that PTI is a member of an emerging class of intracellular
serpins.

Sun et al. (1995) showed that expression of the mouse PI6 homolog, Spi3,
is developmentally regulated, and that, unlike the situation in the
human, Spi3 is absent from the mouse placenta.

Nishibori et al. (1995) isolated a serum protease, designated B43, from
bovine brain. They used histochemical staining to demonstrate its
presence in fibrous astroglial cells, particularly in endfeet-like
cellular structures, suggesting its involvement in the blood-brain
barrier. Partial amino acid sequence of the protease suggested that it
was the homolog of human PI6 and mouse Spi3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sun et al. (1995) determined that the mouse Spi3 gene spans 20 kb,
contains 7 exons and 6 introns, and contains a TATA motif 24 bp upstream
of the transcriptional start site.

MAPPING

Coughlin et al. (1995) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map
the SERPINB6 gene to chromosome 6p25.

While studying a cluster of serine proteinase inhibitors of the
ovalbumin family, including maspin (SERPINB6; 154790) located on
chromosome 18q21.3, Schneider et al. (1995) prepared PCR primer sets for
the 3-prime untranslated region of PTI. Using the NIGMS monochromosomal
somatic cell hybrid panel, they mapped the PTI gene to chromosome 6.
Evans et al. (1995) confirmed the assignment to chromosome 6 and
regionalized it to 6pter-p24 by demonstrating that PI6 colocalizes with
another Ov-serpin gene, ELANH2 (130135). The localization was achieved
with a chromosome 6 regional hybrid DNA panel.

Sun et al. (1995) mapped the mouse Spi3 gene to chromosome 13 between
the Pl1 and ctla2a genes.

GENE FUNCTION

Sirmaci et al. (2010) found that Serpinb6 was expressed in crista hair
cells of the mouse inner ear at embryonic day (E) 16.5. Hair cell
expression was sustained in adult mice. Serpinb6 was expressed in the
cytoplasm of both cochlear and utricular hair cells in the embryo and
early postnatal age, and in the greater epithelial ridge region in early
postnatal age.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By genomewide linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing in
affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with nonsyndromic
progressive hearing loss (DFNB91; 613453), Sirmaci et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous truncating mutation in the SERPINB6 gene (E245X;
173321.0001), resulting in loss of function. Sirmaci et al. (2010)
concluded that SERPINB6 plays an important role in the inner ear in the
protection against leakage of lysosomal content during stress, and that
loss of this protection results in cell death and sensorineural hearing
loss.

ANIMAL MODEL

Scarff et al. (2004) found that Spi3-deficient mice developed normally,
were fertile, and had no obvious pathology. Increased levels of Elanh2
in the tissues of mutant mice suggested that compensation by other
serpins reduced the impact of Spi3 deficiency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 91
SERPINB6, GLU245TER

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with nonsyndromic
progressive hearing loss (DFNB91; 613453), Sirmaci et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 744G-T transversion in the SERPINB6 gene,
resulting in a gly245-to-ter (E245X) substitution, which removes 131
amino acids in the C-terminal region that includes the reactive center
loop. Further studies showed that the mutation resulted in mRNA decay
and complete lack of protein expression. The mutation was not found in
300 Turkish controls or in an additional 542 Turkish, Greek, American,
and Palestinian families, mostly with congenital hearing loss. In vitro
functional expression studies in HeLa cells showed that the E245X
mutation resulted in increased loss of lysosomal integrity in response
to osmotic shock compared to cells transfected with wildtype SERPINB6.
These findings suggested that wildtype SERPINB6 is required to counter
potentially cytotoxic components of leaking lysosomal proteases that
result from various stress conditions. Although the precise age of onset
could not be ascertained, the youngest affected individual, who was 23
years old, reported loss of hearing after age 20. The hearing loss was
progressive and age-dependent, consistent with a loss of function of an
