DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZBED proteins, such as ZBED1, originated from domesticated hAT DNA
transposons and encode regulatory proteins with diverse, fundamental
functions in vertebrates (Hayward et al., 2013).

CLONING

Nagase et al. (1998) cloned the ZBED1 gene, which they designated
KIAA0785, from an adult brain cDNA library, The transcript contains 2
repetitive elements in its 3-prime end and encodes a deduced 694-amino
acid protein. RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression in brain, lung, and
ovary, moderate expression in heart, liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen,
and testis, and low expression in skeletal muscle.

In a search for genes that escape X inactivation, Esposito et al. (1999)
identified ZBED1, which they called TRAMP, as a pseudoautosomal gene
with a functional homolog on the Y chromosome. By PCR of teratocarcinoma
cell line cDNA libraries, they obtained a full-length TRAMP cDNA. The
putative 694-amino acid TRAMP protein shares sequence similarity with
transposases of the Ac family. Moreover, TRAMP shares similarity with
Drosophila Dref, a transcriptional regulatory factor that specifically
binds the promoter-activating element DNA replication-related element
(DRE) of DNA replication-related genes. Northern blot analysis detected
a 5-kb TRAMP transcript in all human tissues examined, with highest
levels in skeletal muscle and heart. RT-PCR confirmed that TRAMP escapes
X inactivation. Esposito et al. (1999) identified putative terminal
inverted repeats (TIRs) and a duplicate target site flanking the TRAMP
gene, suggesting that it is part of an ancient transposable element.
However, the nucleotide differences in these sites and the TIR-binding
inactivity of the putative TRAMP protein suggested that this element is
not an autonomous transposon.

Yamashita et al. (2007) determined that ZBED1, which they called DREF,
contains an N-terminal BED domain and a C-terminal hATC dimerization
domain. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that endogenous DREF
localized to nuclei of HeLa cells during interphase, but it was absent
from condensed chromosomes during mitosis.

Hayward et al. (2013) stated that the 694-amino acid ZBED1 protein has
an N-terminal zinc finger BED domain, named after the domesticated
Drosophila proteins Beaf and Dref, and a C-terminal catalytic domain.
The catalytic domain contains an alpha-helical region, a hAT-type
dimerization motif, and a predicted catalytic DDE motif similar to that
found in the catalytic pockets of integrases of retroviruses and long
terminal repeat retrotransposons.

GENE FUNCTION

Ohshima et al. (2003) demonstrated that human DREF bound DNA with the
consensus sequence 5-prime-TGTCG(C/T)GA(T/C)A. They identified
DREF-binding sequences in the promoter regions of several genes related
to cell proliferation, and they demonstrated that DREF bound and
activated the histone H1 (see 142711) promoter. DREF expression was low
in serum-deprived normal human fibroblasts, but it was induced by serum
and reached a maximum during S phase. RNA interference experiments
targeting DREF inhibited S-phase entry and reduced histone H1 mRNA in
HeLa cells. Ohshima et al. (2003) concluded that DREF has a role in
regulating genes related to cell proliferation.

Using protein pull-down assays, crosslinking, and immunoprecipitation
analysis, Yamashita et al. (2007) showed that the isolated hACT domain
of human DREF and full-length DREF formed dimers, and that DREF mutants
lacking the hATC domain did not dimerize. Point mutations within the
hATC domain revealed that the conserved hydrophobic amino acids trp590,
trp591, and leu601 were critical for DREF self-association. The hATC
domain was also required for efficient nuclear accumulation of DREF via
importin beta-1 (KPNB1; 602738). A cluster of basic amino acids outside
the hATC domain was also necessary for DREF nuclear targeting. EMSA
revealed that the DREF N-terminal domain mediated DNA binding.

GENE STRUCTURE

Esposito et al. (1999) determined that ZBED1 is a single-exon gene.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis, Esposito et al. (1999) mapped the TRAMP gene
to chromosome Xp22.33. Using YAC contigs, they localized the gene 350 to
450 kb distal from the boundary of PAR1.

EVOLUTION

Hayward et al. (2013) found that ZBED genes originated from at least 2
independent hAT DNA transposon domestication events in ancestors of
primitive jawed vertebrates, since no orthologs of ZBEDs were identified
in jawless fish or more primitive vertebrates. ZBED1 belongs to the Ac
family of domesticated hAT DNA transposons, which also includes ZBED2
(615246), ZBED3 (615250), ZBED4 (612552), and ZBED6 (613512).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SUN5 belongs to a family of proteins containing a Sad1/Unc84 (SUN)
domain (see SUN1; 607723). SUN domain-containing proteins interact with
Klarsicht/Anc1/SYNE1 homology (KASH) domain-containing proteins (see
SYNE1; 608441) and function at the nuclear envelope (review by Razafsky
and Hodzic, 2009).

CLONING

Xing et al. (2003) cloned human SUN5, which they designated TSARG4. The
deduced 379-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 43.1
kD. SUN5 shares 45% amino acid identity with SPAG4 (603038) and 74%
identity with mouse Sun5. Human SUN5 was expressed in a wide range of
adult tissues, including testis, whereas mouse Sun5 was expressed
specifically in testis.

MAPPING

Xing et al. (2003) mapped the SUN5 gene to chromosome 20q11.2.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned LARP1, which they designated
KIAA0731. The deduced protein contains 1,096 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected high LARP1 expression in all tissues examined, with highest
level in heart.

Chauvet et al. (2000) cloned fly and mouse Larp, and they identified
orthologs in several species. All LARP proteins, including human LARP,
contain 2 conserved regions. The first conserved region shares homology
with La proteins (see SSB; 109090) from various species, whereas the
second conserved region is restricted to LARP proteins. In situ
hybridization of mouse embryos showed expression of Larp in dorsal root
ganglia and spinal cord, as well as in developing organs characterized
by epithelial-mesenchymal interactions.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the LARP1 gene
to chromosome 10. However, Hartz (2008) mapped the LARP1 gene to
chromosome 5q33.2 based on an alignment of the LARP1 sequence (GenBank
GENBANK AB018274) with the genomic sequence (build 36.1).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TAS2R40 belongs to a family of intronless genes that encode highly
related bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs). TAS2Rs are G protein-coupled
receptors, which are characterized by 7 transmembrane domains (summary
by Fischer et al., 2005). For further information on the TAS2R gene
family, see 604791.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Fischer et al. (2005) mapped the TAS2R40
gene to a TAS2R gene cluster on chromosome 7q31. Gross (2011) mapped the
TAS2R40 gene to chromosome 7q34 based on an alignment of the TAS2R40

600355	TITLE *600355 NEURONAL APOPTOSIS INHIBITORY PROTEIN; NAIP
;;BACULOVIRAL IAP REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; BIRC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In a search for the gene causing spinal muscular atrophy (SMA; 253300),
Roy et al. (1995) isolated a gene on chromosome 5q13.1, of which the
first 2 coding exons were deleted in approximately 67% of type I SMA
chromosomes compared with 2% of non-SMA chromosomes. One model of SMA
pathogenesis invokes an inappropriate persistence of motor neuron
apoptosis, which is a normally occurring phenomenon in development.
Consistent with this hypothesis, the novel gene was labeled 'neuronal
apoptosis inhibitory protein' (NAIP) and its function was supported by
the finding that it contains domains with sequence similarity to IAPs,
baculovirus proteins that inhibit virally induced insect cell apoptosis.
The presence of a variable number of copies of truncated and internally
deleted versions of the NAIP gene (pseudogenes) was thought to be a
possible factor in the genesis of SMA. This situation was compared to
that of the genes on 6p that code for steroid 21-hydroxylase (CYP21)
deficiency (201910); through the processes of unequal crossing-over or
gene conversion, mutations in the functional CYP21 gene (613815) can
result. Roy et al. (1995) raised the possibility that NAIP functions in
concert with SMN (600354) mutations in causing spinal muscular atrophy.

GENE FUNCTION

Liston et al. (1996) demonstrated that expression of NAIP in mammalian
cells inhibits apoptosis induced by a variety of signals.

NAIP, HIAP1 (601721), HIAP2 (601712), XIAP (300079), BIRC5 (603352), and
BIRC6 (605638) are members of the mammalian inhibitors of apoptosis
family and contain an N-terminal domain with 1 to 3 imperfect repeats of
an approximately 65-amino acid domain named the baculovirus IAP repeat
(BIR) motif. Gotz et al. (2000) identified 6 mouse Naip genes which were
expressed in a broad range of tissues. Using a neurite outgrowth assay
in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, they observed that Naip
overexpression impaired nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite
outgrowth. The BIR motifs of Naip (residues 1-345) were not required for
this effect. However, the BIR domains of Naip were essential to prevent
apoptosis in PC12 cells after NGF deprivation or tumor necrosis
factor-alpha receptor (TNFAR; 191190) stimulation. Expression of
full-length but not BIR-deleted Naip protected against cell death. This
correlated with reduced activity of the cell death effector protease,
caspase-3 (600636), in lysates of Naip-PC12 cells. The authors
hypothesized that dysregulation of cellular differentiation and/or
caspase suppression may contribute to motoneuron dysfunction and cell
death in spinal muscular atrophy where NAIP is mutated.

Kofoed and Vance (2011) showed in mice that different NAIP paralogs
determine the specificity of the NLRC4 (606831) inflammasome for
distinct bacterial ligands. In particular, they found that activation of
endogenous NLRC4 by bacterial PrgJ requires NAIP2, a previously
uncharacterized member of the NAIP gene family, whereas NAIP5 and NAIP6
activate NLRC4 specifically in response to bacterial flagellin. Kofoed
and Vance (2011) dissected the biochemical mechanism underlying the
requirement for NAIP proteins by use of a reconstituted NLRC4
inflammasome system. They found that NAIP proteins control
ligand-dependent oligomerization of NLRC4 and that the NAIP2-NLRC4
complex physically associates with PrgJ but not flagellin, whereas
NAIP5-NLRC4 associates with flagellin but not PrgJ. Kofoed and Vance
(2011) concluded that their results identified NAIPs as immune sensor
proteins in the mouse and provided biochemical evidence for a simple
receptor-ligand model for activation of the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasomes.

Zhao et al. (2011) showed that NAIP5, required for Legionella
pneumophila replication in mouse macrophages, is a universal component
of the flagellin-NLCR4 pathway. NAIP5 directly and specifically
interacted with flagellin, which determined the inflammasome stimulation
activities of different bacterial flagellins. NAIP5 engagement by
flagellin promoted a physical NAIP5-NLRC4 association, rendering full
reconstitution of a flagellin-responsive NLRC4 inflammasome in
nonmacrophage cells. The related NAIP2 functioned analogously to NAIP5,
serving as a specific inflammasome receptor for type III secretion
system (TTSS) rod proteins such as Salmonella PrgJ and Burkholderia
BsaK. Genetic analysis of Chromobacterium violaceum infection revealed
that the TTSS needle protein Cpr1 can stimulate NLRC4 inflammasome
activation in human macrophages. Similarly, Cpr1 is specifically
recognized by human NAIP, the sole NAIP family member in human. The
finding that NAIP proteins are inflammasome receptors for bacterial
flagellin and TTSS apparatus components further predicted that the
remaining NAIP family members may recognize other microbial products to
activate NLRC4 inflammasome-mediated innate immunity.

To identify CASP1 (147678) functions in vivo, von Moltke et al. (2012)
devised a strategy for cytosolic delivery of bacterial flagellin, a
specific ligand for the NAIP5/NLRC4 inflammasome. Von Moltke et al.
(2012) showed that systemic inflammasome activation by flagellin leads
to a loss of vascular fluid into the intestine and peritoneal cavity,
resulting in rapid (less than 30 minutes) death in mice. This unexpected
response depends on the inflammasome components NAIP5, NLRC4, and CASP1,
but is independent of the production of IL1-beta (147720) or IL18
(600953). Instead, inflammasome activation results, within minutes, in
an 'eicosanoid storm'--a pathologic release of signaling lipids,
including prostaglandins and leukotrienes, that rapidly initiate
inflammation and vascular fluid loss. Mice deficient in cyclooxygenase-1
(COX1, PTGS1; 176805), a critical enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis,
are resistant to these rapid pathologic effects of systemic inflammasome
activation by either flagellin or anthrax lethal toxin.
Inflammasome-dependent biosynthesis of eicosanoids is mediated by the
activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (see 172410) in resident
peritoneal macrophages, which are specifically primed for the production
of eicosanoids by high expression of eicosanoid biosynthetic enzymes.
Von Moltke et al. (2012) concluded that their results identified
eicosanoids as a previously unrecognized cell type-specific signaling
output of the inflammasome with marked physiologic consequences in vivo.

MAPPING

Roy et al. (1995) mapped the NAIP gene to chromosome 5q13.1. DiDonato et
al. (1997) mapped the mouse homolog of NAIP to chromosome 13 in a region
showing conserved synteny with human 5q13.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Although NAIP deletions are more frequently observed in patients
affected by the acute form of SMA, it is not possible to establish an
unambiguous correlation between deletion size and clinical severity.
Novelli et al. (1997) investigated the effects of gender on the
association between NAIP gene deletion and disease severity. No
significant relationship between deletion size and clinical phenotype
was observed among male patients, whereas in females the absence of NAIP
was strongly associated with a severe phenotype (p less than 0.0001).
SMA I was found in 75.6% of females and only 52.5% of males lacking
NAIP. These results provided a possible molecular explanation for the
sex-dependent phenotypic variation observed in SMA patients.

ANIMAL MODEL

In inbred mouse strains, permissiveness to intracellular replication of
Legionella pneumophila is controlled by a single locus (Lgn1), which
maps to a region within distal chromosome 13 that contains multiple
copies of the Birc1 gene. Genomic BAC clones from the critical interval
were transferred into transgenic mice to complement functionally the
Lgn1-associated susceptibility of A/J mice to L. pneumophila. Diez et
al. (2003) found that 2 independent BAC clones that rescued
susceptibility had an overlapping region of 56 kb in which the entire
Lgn1 transcript must lie. The full-length transcript of Birc1e (also
called Naip5) is coded in this region. The results indicated a role for
Birc1e in macrophage resistance to L. pneumophila infection. BIRC1
proteins are members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family,
structurally defined by baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis repeat (BIR)
domains implicated in protein-protein interactions. An antiapoptotic
effect of BIRC1 has been described. Induction of apoptosis seems to be
important for pathogenesis of L. pneumophila in human macrophages in
vitro.

Zamboni et al. (2006) noted that there are 14 amino acid differences in
Birc1e between A/J and C57Bl/6 mice. A/J macrophages permit more L.
pneumophila replication than C57Bl/6 macrophages. Zamboni et al. (2006)
found that Birc1e-expressing cells from C57Bl/6 mice, but not those from
A/J mice, responded to L. pneumophila infection and delivery of
bacterial molecules to the cytosol with Casp1 (147678)-dependent cell
death. Mutation analysis showed that the leucine-rich region of Birc1e
regulated Birc1e activation, Casp1 activation, and Il1b (147720)
secretion and required Ipaf (CARD12; 606831). Zamboni et al. (2006)
concluded that Birc1e is a nucleotide-binding
oligomerization-leucine-rich repeat protein involved in detection and
control of intracellular L. pneumophila.

;;DORA REVERSE STRAND; DREV
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Bates et al. (2000) identified ESTs containing sequences complementary
to the region 5-prime of the mouse and human IGSF6 genes (606222). The
deduced proteins, designated DREV (DORA reverse strand) proteins, show
weak homology to ribosomal RNA adenine dimethylases and contain
conserved consensus sequences for the recognition of nucleotide methyl
groups and possibly for methyl group transfer. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected ubiquitous and variable Drev expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bates et al. (2000) determined that the DREV gene contains 5 exons. The
5-prime UTR has a high GC content. Intron 4 of the DREV gene contains
the entire IGSF6 gene on the complementary strand, and there is a
retrotransposon-like sequence between the 3-prime end of the IGSF6 gene
and exon 4 of the DREV gene.

MAPPING

By FISH, Bates et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Drev gene to a region of
chromosome 7F2-F3 that shows homology of synteny with human chromosome
16p12-p11. Bates et al. (1998) had earlier mapped the human IGSF6 gene
to chromosome 16p13.

601143	TITLE *601143 DYNACTIN 1; DCTN1
;;p150(GLUED), DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule-based biologic motor protein.
Holzbaur and Tokito (1996) noted that dyneins were initially discovered
as enzymes that couple ATP hydrolysis to provide a force for cellular
motility in eukaryotic cilia and flagella. A distinct cytoplasmic form
of dynein (600112) was subsequently characterized and thought to be
responsible for the intracellular retrograde motility of vesicles and
organelles along microtubules (Holzbaur and Vallee, 1994). A large
macromolecular complex, dynactin, is required for the cytoplasmic
dynein-driven movement of organelles along microtubules. Dynactin is
composed of 10 distinct polypeptides of 150, 135, 62, 50 (DCTN2;
607376), 45, 42, 37, 32, 27, and 24 kD, with a combined mass of 10
million daltons. The largest polypeptide of the dynactin complex,
p150(Glued), binds directly to microtubules and to cytoplasmic dynein.
The binding of dynactin to dynein is critical for neuronal function, as
antibodies that specifically disrupt this binding block vesicle motility
along microtubules in extruded squid axoplasm. Holzbaur and Tokito
(1996) stated that the dynein-dynactin interaction is probably a key
component of the mechanism of axonal transport of vesicles and
organelles. Further evidence for a critical role for dynactin in vivo
comes from the analysis of mutations in the homologous gene in
Drosophila. Mutant alleles of the 'glued' gene induced disruption of the
neurons of the optic lobe and compound eye in heterozygotes; null
mutations are lethal.

CLONING

Holzbaur and Tokito (1996) isolated and characterized cDNA clones
encoding human p150(Glued), as well as alternatively spliced isoforms.
Using these to isolate genomic clones, they found by genomic Southern
blots that there is a single gene in the human, as had previously been
observed in rat and chick.

Jang et al. (1997) cloned and characterized mouse Dctn1. The mouse
protein shares 95% amino acid identity with the human protein. The
authors found no abnormalities of the gene in mnd2 mice.

GENE FUNCTION

Eaton et al. (2002) disrupted the dynactin complex in Drosophila, using
3 separate perturbations: dsRNA interference with arp1 (homolog of
ACTR1A; 605143), mutation in p150/Glued, and a dominant-negative Glued
transgene. In all 3 cases, the disruption resulted in an increase in the
frequency and extent of synaptic retraction events at the neuromuscular
junction. Eaton et al. (2002) concluded that dynactin functions locally
within the presynaptic arbor to promote synapse stability at the
neuromuscular junction.

Kim et al. (2004) showed that BBS4 (600374) protein localizes to the
centriolar satellites of centrosomes and basal bodies of primary cilia,
where it functions as an adaptor of the p150(glued) subunit of the
dynein transport machinery to recruit pericentriolar material-1 protein
(PCM1; 600299) and its associated cargo to the satellites. Silencing of
BBS4 induces PCM1 mislocalization and concomitant deanchoring of
centrosomal microtubules, arrest in cell division, and apoptotic cell
death.

Gauthier et al. (2004) showed that huntingtin (613004) specifically
enhances vesicular transport of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF;
113505) along microtubules. They determined that huntingtin-mediated
transport involves huntingtin-associated protein-1 (HAP1; 600947) and
the p150(Glued) subunit of dynactin, an essential component of molecular
motors. BDNF transport was attenuated both in the disease context and by
reducing the levels of wildtype huntingtin. The alteration of the
huntingtin/HAP1/p150(Glued) complex correlated with reduced association
of motor proteins with microtubules. The
polyglutamine-huntingtin-induced transport deficit resulted in the loss
of neurotrophic support and neuronal toxicity. Gauthier et al. (2004)
concluded that a key role of huntingtin is to promote BDNF transport and
suggested that loss of this function might contribute to pathogenesis.

Using in vivo skin-specific lentiviral RNA interference, Williams et al.
(2011) investigated spindle orientation regulation and provided direct
evidence that LGN (609245), NuMA (164009), and dynactin are involved. In
compromising asymmetric cell divisions, Williams et al. (2011) uncovered
profound defects in stratification, differentiation, and barrier
formation, and implicated Notch (190198) signaling as an important
effector. Williams et al. (2011) concluded that asymmetric cell division
components act by reorientating mitotic spindles to achieve
perpendicular divisions, which in turn promote stratification and
differentiation. Furthermore, the resemblance between their knockdown
phenotypes and Rbpj (147183) loss-of-function mutants provided important
clues that suprabasal Notch signaling is impaired when asymmetric cell
divisions do not occur.

GENE STRUCTURE

Collin et al. (1998) found that the DCTN1 gene spans approximately 19.4
kb of genomic DNA and consists of at least 32 exons ranging in size from
15 to 499 bp.

Pushkin et al. (2001) showed by Southern blot and BAC analyses that the
DCTN1 and SLC4A5 (606757) proteins are encoded by a single locus. The
DCTN1-SLC4A5 locus spans approximately 230 kb and contains 66 exons.
Approximately 200 kb encode SLC4A5. DCTN1 is encoded by exons 1 through
alternative exon 32. The same locus therefore uniquely encodes both a
membrane protein (SLC4A5) and a cytoplasmic protein (DCTN1) with
distinct functions.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Holzbaur and Tokito (1996) mapped
the DCTN1 gene to 2p13. They noted that the location of the gene
corresponds to that of a form of recessive limb-girdle muscular
dystrophy (see LGMD2B; 253601). Also, this region of human chromosome 2
shows syntenic homology with a region of mouse chromosome 6 containing
the mnd2 mouse mutation, which exhibits symptoms resembling human motor
neuron disease.

Korthaus et al. (1997) presented evidence that the DCTN1 gene maps to
chromosome 2 between TGFA and D2S1394.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Puls et al. (2003) identified a gly59-to-ser mutation (601143.0001) in
the DCTN1 gene in a family with slowly progressive autosomal dominant
distal hereditary motor neuronopathy with vocal paresis (HMN7B; 607641).

Among 250 patients with a putative diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS; 105400), Munch et al. (2004) identified 3 mutations in
the DCTN1 gene (601143.0002-601143.0004) in 3 families. The authors
distinguished the phenotype in their patients from that reported by Puls
et al. (2003) by the presence of upper motor neuron signs, although
specific clinical details were lacking. Munch et al. (2004) suggested
that mutations in the DCTN1 gene may be a susceptibility factor for ALS.

In affected members of 8 families with Perry syndrome (168605), Farrer
et al. (2009) identified 5 different heterozygous mutations in the DCTN1
gene (see, e.g., 601143.0006-601143.0007). In vitro functional
expression studies indicated that the mutations resulted in decreased
microtubule binding and intracytoplasmic inclusions.

Vilarino-Guell et al. (2009) sequenced the DCTN1 gene in 286 individuals
with Parkinson disease (PD; 168600), frontotemporal lobar degeneration
(FTLD; 600274), or ALS. None of the 36 variants identified segregated
conclusively within families, suggesting that DCTN1 mutations are rare
and do not play a common role in these diseases. Further analysis of 440
patients with PD, 374 with FTLD, and 372 with ALS without a family
history also failed to find an association between DCTN1 variants and
disease. In fact, the previously reported pathogenic mutation T1249I
(601143.0002) was identified in 3 of 435 controls and did not segregate
in a large pedigree with Parkinson disease, thus weakening the evidence
for the pathogenicity of this variant.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEURONOPATHY, DISTAL HEREDITARY MOTOR, TYPE VIIB
DCTN1, GLY59SER

In a North American family with a slowly progressive, autosomal dominant
form of lower motor neuron with vocal cord paresis but without sensory
symptoms (607641), Puls et al. (2003) found a single-basepair change in
the DCTN1 gene (957C-T) resulting in an amino acid substitution of
serine for glycine at position 59 in affected family members. The G59S
substitution occurred in the highly conserved CAP-Gly motif of the
p150(Glued) subunit of dynactin, a domain that binds directly to
microtubules. The transport protein dynactin is required for
dynein-mediated retrograde transport of vesicles and organelles along
microtubules. Overexpression of dynamitin (607376), the p50 subunit of
the dynactin complex, disrupts the complex and produces a late-onset,
progressive motor neuron disease in transgenic mice (LaMonte et al.,
2002).

Based on crystal structure, gly59 is embedded in a beta-sheet. In
budding yeast, Moore et al. (2009) generated a G59S-analogous mutation
that resulted in complete loss of the CAP-Gly domain. Functional
expression studies showed that the CAP-Gly domain has a critical role in
the initiation and persistence of dynein-dependent movement of the
mitotic spindle and nucleus, but was otherwise dispensable for
dynein-based movement. The function also appeared to be
context-dependent, such as during mitosis, indicating that CAP-Gly
activity may only be necessary when dynein needs to overcome high force
thresholds to produce movement. The CAP-Gly domain was not the primary
link between dynactin and microtubules, although it was involved in the
interaction.

.0002
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DCTN1, THR1249ILE

In a woman with a disorder similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(105400), Munch et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 4546C-T
transition in exon 13 of the DCTN1 gene, resulting in a thr1249-to-ile
(T1249I) substitution. She had disease onset at age 56 years, with gait
disturbance and distal lower limb muscle weakness and atrophy. The
symptoms were slowly progressive over 4 years. There was no involvement
of the upper limbs or bulbar region. There was no family history. The
mutation was not identified in 150 control subjects. See also 607641.

Vilarino-Guell et al. (2009) identified the T1249I variant in 3 of 435
controls, 5 of 440 patients with Parkinson disease (168600), 1 of 374
with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (600274), and 5 of 372 patients
with ALS. Lack of segregation of the variant in a large pedigree with
Parkinson disease weakened the evidence for the pathogenicity of this
variant.

.0003
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DCTN1, MET571THR

In a woman with probable ALS (105400), Munch et al. (2004) identified a
heterozygous 2512T-C transition in exon 15 of the DCTN1 gene, resulting
in a met571-to-thr (M571T) substitution. She had onset of upper limb
involvement at age 48 years and developed bulbar symptoms within 8
years. Her sister was similarly affected, although DNA was not
available. The mutation was not identified in 150 control subjects.

.0004
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DCTN1, ARG785TRP

In 2 brothers with probable ALS (105400), Munch et al. (2004) identified
a heterozygous 3153C-T transition in exon 20 of the DCTN1 gene,
resulting in an arg785-to-trp (R785W) substitution. The proband had
upper limb onset at age 55 years, whereas his brother had bulbar onset
at age 64 years. The asymptomatic mother and sister carried the same
mutation, suggesting incomplete penetrance. The mutation was not
identified in 150 control subjects.

.0005
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DCTN1, ARG1101LYS

In a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (105400), Munch et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 4102G-A transition in the DCTN1 gene,
resulting in an arg1101-to-lys (R1101K) substitution. The patient's
brother, who also carried the R1101K mutation, had frontotemporal
dementia without motor involvement. Family history revealed that 2
additional family members reportedly had motor neuron disease and
frontotemporal dementia, respectively, but their DNA was not available
for testing. The mutation was not identified in 500 control individuals.
Despite the molecular findings, Munch et al. (2005) suggested that the
R1101K variant may not be the primary gene defect in this family.

.0006
PERRY SYNDROME
DCTN1, GLY71ARG

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with Perry syndrome
(168605), Farrer et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 211G-A
transition in exon 2 of the DCTN1 gene, resulting in a gly71-to-arg
(G71R) substitution in a highly conserved residue within the GKNDG
binding motif of the CAP-Gly domain. The families were of Canadian and
Turkish ancestry, respectively, and haplotype analysis excluded a
founder effect. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutation decreased microtubule binding and resulted in intracytoplasmic
inclusions.

.0007
PERRY SYNDROME
DCTN1, GLN74PRO

In affected members of a Japanese family with Perry syndrome (168605),
Farrer et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 221A-C transversion in
exon 2 of the DCTN1 gene, resulting in a gln74-to-pro (Q74P)
substitution in a highly conserved residue adjacent to the GKNDG binding
motif of the CAP-Gly domain. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutation decreased microtubule binding and resulted in
intracytoplasmic inclusions.

147796	TITLE *147796 JANUS KINASE 2; JAK2
JAK2/ETV6 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

JAK2 kinase is a member of a family of tyrosine kinases involved in
cytokine receptor signaling. See 147795 for background information on
Janus kinases.

CLONING

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with a probe encoding the
catalytic domain of rat Jak2, followed by EST database searching,
Saltzman et al. (1998) obtained a cDNA encoding a full-length JAK2
sequence. The JAK2 gene encodes a 1,132-amino acid protein that shares
95% sequence similarity to rat and pig Jak2. Northern blot analysis
detected expression of 3 transcripts of 7.6, 5.9 and 4.8 kb in all
tissues tested except heart and skeletal muscle. Highest expression was
found in spleen, peripheral blood leukocytes, and testis. In heart and
skeletal muscle, significant expression of 7.6-, 4.8-, and 3.9-kb
transcripts was found.

MAPPING

Pritchard et al. (1992) mapped the JAK2 gene to chromosome 9p24 by in
situ hybridization. Gough et al. (1995) mapped the homologous gene
(Jak2) to mouse chromosome 19 in a region of homology of synteny to
human 9.

GENE FUNCTION

Campbell et al. (1994) presented evidence that JAK2 is constitutively
associated with the prolactin receptor (PRLR; 176761) and that it is
activated and tyrosine phosphorylated upon PRL binding to the PRL
receptor. These results are consistent with JAK2 serving as an early,
perhaps initial, signaling molecule for prolactin.

Watling et al. (1993) isolated a cell line, selected for its inability
to express interferon (IFN)-gamma (147570)-inducible cell-surface
markers. The cell line was deficient in all aspects of IFN-gamma
response tested but responded normally to alpha and beta IFNs (see
147660). The mutant cells could be complemented by the expression of
JAK2. Unlike IFNs alpha and beta, IFN-gamma induced rapid tyrosine
phosphorylation of JAK2 in wildtype cells, and JAK2 immunoprecipitates
from these cells showed tyrosine kinase activity. These responses were
absent in the mutant cell line. JAK2 is, therefore, required for the
response to interferon-gamma but not to IFNs alpha and beta.

Saltzman et al. (1998) demonstrated that JAK2 phosphorylates STAT1
(600555), STAT2 (600556), STAT3 (102582), STAT4 (600558), and STAT5 (see
STAT5A, 601511, and STAT5B, 604260), but not STAT6 (601512).

STAT5 is activated in a broad spectrum of human hematologic
malignancies. Using a genetic approach, Schwaller et al. (2000)
addressed whether activation of STAT5 is necessary for the myelo- and
lymphoproliferative disease induced by the TEL (600618)/JAK2 fusion
gene. Whereas mice transplanted with bone marrow transduced with
retrovirus expressing TEL/JAK2 developed a rapidly fatal myelo- and
lymphoproliferative syndrome, reconstitution with bone marrow derived
from Stat5a/b-deficient mice expressing TEL/JAK2 did not induce disease.
Disease induction in the Stat5a/b-deficient background was rescued with
a bicistronic retrovirus encoding TEL/JAK2 and Stat5a. Furthermore,
myeloproliferative disease was induced by reconstitution with bone
marrow cells expressing a constitutively active mutant, Stat5a, or a
single Stat5a target, murine oncostatin M (OSM; 165095). These data
defined a critical role for STAT5A/B and OSM in the pathogenesis of
TEL/JAK2 disease.

In addition to its role as a kidney cytokine regulating hematopoiesis,
erythropoietin (133170) is also produced in the brain after oxidative or
nitrosative stress. The transcription factor HIF1 (603348) upregulates
erythropoietin following hypoxic stimuli. Digicaylioglu and Lipton
(2001) demonstrated that preconditioning with erythropoietin protects
neurons in models of ischemic and degenerative damage due to
excitotoxins and consequent generation of free radicals, including
nitric oxide. Activation of neuronal erythropoietin receptors (EPOR;
133171) prevents apoptosis induced by NMDA or nitric oxide by triggering
crosstalk between the signaling pathways JAK2 and NFKB (see 164011).
Digicaylioglu and Lipton (2001) demonstrated that erythropoietin
receptor-mediated activation of JAK2 leads to phosphorylation of the
inhibitor of NFKB (I-kappa-B-alpha; 164008), subsequent nuclear
translocation of the transcription factor NFKB, and NFKB-dependent
transcription of neuroprotective genes. Transfection of cerebrocortical
neurons with a dominant interfering form of JAK2 or an I-kappa-B-alpha
superrepressor blocks erythropoietin-mediated prevention of neuronal
apoptosis. Thus, neuronal erythropoietin receptors activate a
neuroprotective pathway that is distinct from previously well
characterized JAK and NFKB functions. Moreover, this erythropoietin
effect may underlie neuroprotection mediated by hypoxic-ischemic
preconditioning.

Huang et al. (2001) showed that JAK2, and more specifically just its
intact N-terminal domain, binds to EPOR in the endoplasmic reticulum and
promotes its cell surface expression. This interaction was specific, as
JAK1 had no effect. Residues 32 to 58 of the JAK2 JH7 domain were
required for EPOR surface expression. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of
the EPOR membrane proximal region revealed 2 modes of EPOR-JAK2
interaction. A continuous block of EPOR residues was required for
functional, ligand-independent binding to JAK2 and cell surface receptor
expression, whereas 4 specific residues were essential in switching on
prebound JAK2 after ligand binding. Thus, in addition to its kinase
activity required for cytokine receptor signaling, JAK is also an
essential subunit required for surface expression of cytokine receptors.

Dawson et al. (2009) showed that human JAK2 is present in the nucleus of
hematopoietic cells and directly phosphorylates tyr41 (Y41) on histone
H3 (see 602810). Heterochromatin protein 1-alpha (HP1-alpha, 604478),
but not HP1-beta (604511), specifically binds to this region of H3
through its chromo-shadow domain. Phosphorylation of H3Y41 by JAK2
prevents this binding. Inhibition of JAK2 activity in human leukemic
cells decreases both the expression of hematopoietic oncogene LMO2
(180385) and the phosphorylation of H3Y41 at its promoter, while
simultaneously increasing the binding of HP1-alpha at the same site.
Dawson et al. (2009) concluded that their results identified a
previously unrecognized nuclear role for JAK2 in the phosphorylation of
H3Y41 and revealed a direct mechanistic link between 2 genes, JAK2 and
LMO2, involved in normal hematopoiesis and leukemia.

Mullighan et al. (2009) reported a recurring interstitial deletion of
pseudoautosomal region 1 of chromosomes X and Y in B-progenitor ALL
(613035) that juxtaposes the first, noncoding exon of P2RY8 (300525)
with the coding region of CRLF2 (300357). They identified the
P2RY8/CRLF2 fusion in 7% of individuals with B-progenitor ALL and 53% of
individuals with ALL associated with Down syndrome. CRLF2 alteration was
associated with activating JAK mutations, and expression of human
P2RY8/CRLF2 together with mutated mouse Jak2 resulted in constitutive
JAK-STAT activation and cytokine-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells
overexpressing IL7 receptor-alpha (IL7R; 146661). Mullighan et al.
(2009) concluded that rearrangement of CRLF2 and JAK mutations together
contribute to leukemogenesis in B-progenitor ALL.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Polycythemia vera (263300), thrombocythemia (THCYT3; 614521), and
idiopathic myelofibrosis (254450) are clonal myeloproliferative
disorders arising from a multipotent progenitor. The loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 9p in myeloproliferative disorders
suggested that 9p harbors a mutation that contributes to the cause of
clonal expansion of hematopoietic cells in these diseases. Baxter et al.
(2005) and Kralovics et al. (2005) found that a high proportion of
patients with these myeloproliferative disorders carried a dominant
somatic gain-of-function val617-to-phe mutation in the JAK2 gene (V617F;
147796.0001).

James et al. (2005) identified a somatic V617F mutation in 40 of 45
patients with polycythemia vera. They found that the mutation leads to
constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation activity that promotes cytokine
hypersensitivity and induces erythrocytosis in a mouse model.

Using granulocyte-based mutation screening in 220 patients with either
polycythemia vera or myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia, Tefferi et
al. (2005) identified 21 patients who were homozygous for the V617F
mutation of JAK2; 13 had polycythemia vera and 8 had myelofibrosis with
myeloid metaplasia. Kralovics et al. (2005) proposed a 2-step model for
the role of JAK2 (V617F) in the clonal evolution of myeloproliferative
disorders. The first step consists, in their view, of a G-to-T mutation
in 1 allele of the JAK2 gene that is acquired as a somatic mutation in a
hematopoietic progenitor cell or stem cell. This cell gives rise to a
clone that is heterozygous for V617F and expands to replace
hematopoietic cells without the JAK2 mutation. The second step consists
of a mitotic recombination in 1 of the progenitor cells or stem cells
heterozygous for the JAK2 mutation that generates uniparental disomy and
homozygosity for JAK2 (V617F) in 1 of the 2 daughter cells. This
daughter cell gives rise to a clone that is homozygous for V617F and
expands to replace heterozygous hematopoietic cells.

Lee et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for mutations in the JAK2
gene (V617F and K607N, 147796.0002) in bone marrow aspirates from 3
(2.7%) of 113 unrelated patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML;
601626). JAK2 mutations were not found in 94 ductal breast carcinomas,
104 colorectal carcinomas, or 217 nonsmall cell lung cancers.

Scott et al. (2007) searched for new mutations in members of the JAK and
signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT; see 600555) gene
families in patients with V617F-negative polycythemia vera or idiopathic
erythrocytosis (see 133100). They identified 4 somatic gain-of-function
mutations affecting exon 12 of JAK2 in 10 of the V617F-negative
patients. Those with a JAK2 exon 12 mutation presented with an isolated
erythrocytosis and distinctive bone marrow morphology, and several also
had reduced serum erythropoietin levels. Erythroid colonies could be
grown from their blood samples in the absence of exogenous
erythropoietin. All such erythroid colonies were heterozygous for the
mutation, whereas colonies homozygous for the mutation occur in most
patients with V617F-positive polycythemia vera. BaF3 cells expressing
the murine erythropoietin receptor and also carrying exon 12 mutations
could proliferate without added interleukin-3 (147740). They also
exhibited increased phosphorylation of JAK2 and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1; 176872) and 2 (ERK2; 176948), as
compared with cells transduced by wildtype JAK2 or V617F JAK2. Three of
the exon 12 mutations included a substitution of leucine for lysine at
position 539 of JAK2 (147796.0003). This mutation resulted in a
myeloproliferative phenotype, including erythrocytosis, in a murine
model of retroviral bone marrow transplantation.

Bercovich et al. (2008) identified somatic JAK2 mutations in 16 (18%) of
88 patients with Down syndrome (190685)-associated acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL). Only 1 of 109 patients with non-Down syndrome-associated
leukemia had the mutation, but this child was also found to have an
isochromosome 21q. All the JAK2-associated leukemias were of the B-cell
precursor type. Children with a JAK2 mutation were younger (mean age,
4.5 years) compared to patients without JAK2 mutations (8.6 years) at
diagnosis. Five mutant JAK2 alleles were identified, each affecting a
highly conserved residue: arg683 (i.e., R683G, R683S, R683K). In vitro
functional expression studies in mouse hematopoietic progenitor cells
showed that the mutations caused constitutive Jak/Stat activation and
cytokine-independent growth, consistent with a gain of function. This
growth was sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition with a JAK inhibitor.
Modeling studies showed that arg683 is located in an exposed conserved
region of the JAK2 pseudokinase domain in a region different from that
implicated in myeloproliferative disorders. Bercovich et al. (2008)
concluded that there is a specific association between constitutional
trisomy 21 and arg683 JAK2 mutations that predisposes to the development
of B-cell ALL in patients with Down syndrome.

- Germline JAK2 Mutation

In a case-control study of unexplained pregnancy loss (see 614389),
Mercier et al. (2007) found association between the JAK2 V617F mutation
and the risk of fetal or embryonic loss. However, Dahabreh et al. (2008)
found no evidence for increased prevalence of the JAK2 V617F mutation in
women with a history of recurrent miscarriage.

By genomewide analysis of 181 individuals with polycythemia vera or
essential thrombocytosis, Kilpivaara et al. (2009) identified a C-G
transversion in intron 12 (dbSNP rs10974944) that predisposed to the
development of V617F-positive myeloproliferative neoplasms. The minor G
allele of this SNP was significantly more common among 324 individuals
with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, or primary
myelofibrosis, compared to controls (odds ratio of 3.1; p = 4.1 x
10(-20)). The V617F mutation was preferentially acquired in cis with the
predisposition allele. These data suggested that germline variations are
an important contributor to myeloproliferative phenotype and
predisposition associated with somatic mutations.

Jones et al. (2009) found that 109 (77%) of 142 alleles harboring the
JAK2 V617F mutation from patients with a myeloproliferative neoplasm had
the JAK2 46/1 haplotype, which was tagged by dbSNP rs12343867 in intron
14 and dbSNP rs12340895, compared to only 9 (12%) of the 74 residual
wildtype alleles (p = 1.4 x 10(-20)). The results indicated that
homozygosity for V617F was not random, but rather occurred
preferentially when this mutation was present on the specific JAK2
haplotype. Additional analysis in 177 heterozygous V617F carriers found
that V617F occurred more frequently on the 46/1 haplotype (135 of 354
alleles) compared to 188 controls (92 of 376 alleles; p = 0.0001) and
1,500 controls (p = 3.3 x 10(-8)). Sequencing of the products in 66
informative cases showed that 49 (74%) V617F alleles arose on the 46/1
allele, whereas only 17 (26%) wildtype alleles were on 46/1 (p = 2.1 x
10(-8)). V617F-associated disease was strongly associated with haplotype
46/1 in all 3 disease entities compared to healthy controls:
polycythemia vera (p = 2.9 x 10(-16)), essential thrombocythemia (p =
8.2 x 10(-9)), and myelofibrosis (p = 8.0 x 10(-5)). Jones et al. (2009)
concluded that the 46/1 haplotype predisposes to the development of
V617F-associated myeloproliferative neoplasms, with an overall odds
ratio of 3.7.

Olcaydu et al. (2009) also found that a JAK2 haplotype including dbSNP
rs12343867 preferentially acquired the V617F mutation and conferred
susceptibility to myeloproliferative disorders. Ninety-three (85%) of
109 individuals with myeloproliferative disorders who were heterozygous
for dbSNP rs12343867 carried the V617F mutation on the C allele (p = 7.8
x 10(-15)). Olcaydu et al. (2009) suggested that a certain combination
of SNPs may render haplotypes differentially susceptible to somatic
mutagenesis.

In affected members of a family with autosomal dominant
thrombocythemia-3 (THCYT3; 614521), Mead et al. (2012) identified a
germline heterozygous G-to-A transition in the JAK2 gene, resulting in a
val617-to-ile (V617I) substitution. The proband presented at age 53
years with an ischemic cerebrovascular event associated with
long-standing thrombocytosis (700 x 10(9) to 970 x 10(9)). There were 5
additional family members with thrombocytosis, including 1 with a
myocardial infarction at age 46 and another with a myocardial infarction
at age 65 and an ischemic cerebrovascular event at age 72. Bone marrow
biopsy showed megakaryocyte hyperplasia without fibrosis. In addition,
none of the patients had splenomegaly or evidence of leukemic
transformation. Examination of peripheral blood cells showed normal
baseline STAT3 (102582) activity and lack of cytokine-independent colony
formation. However, after stimulation with granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (GCSF; 138970), V617I-containing CD33+ myeloid
and CD34+ stem cells showed a marked increase in STAT3 levels,
particularly in response to low levels of GCSF, suggesting that the
mutation causes limited constitutive activation with a reduced threshold
for cytokine-induced activation.

CYTOGENETICS

- ETV6/JAK2 Fusion Gene

Peeters et al. (1997) identified a t(9;12)(p24;p13) translocation in a
patient with early pre-B acute lymphoid leukemia and a
t(9;15;12)(p24;q15;p13) translocation in a patient with atypical chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML; 608232) in transformation. Both changes
involved the ETV6 gene (600618) at 12p13 and the JAK2 gene at 9p24. In
each case different fusion mRNAs were found, with only 1 resulting in a
chimeric protein consisting of the oligomerization domain of ETV6 and
the protein tyrosine kinase domain of JAK2.

Lacronique et al. (1997) observed a t(9;12)(p24;p13) translocation in
leukemic cells from a 4-year-old boy with T-cell ALL. The 3-prime
portion of the JAK2 gene was fused to the 5-prime portion of the ETV6
gene, resulting in a protein containing the catalytic domain of JAK2 and
the oligomerization domain of ETV6. The resultant protein had
constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and conferred cytokine-independent
proliferation to a murine cell line.

ANIMAL MODEL

To assess the role of JAK2, Parganas et al. (1998) derived
Jak2-deficient mice by targeted disruption of the mouse gene in
embryonic stem cells. The mutation caused an embryonic lethality due to
the absence of definitive erythropoiesis. Fetal liver myeloid
progenitors, although present based on the expression of
lineage-specific markers, failed to respond to erythropoietin,
thrombopoietin (600044), interleukin-3 (147740), or
granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (138960). In contrast,
the response to granulocyte-specific colony-stimulating factor was
unaffected. Jak2-deficient fibroblasts failed to respond to IFN-gamma,
although the responses to IFN-alpha/beta and interleukin-6 (147620) were
unaffected. Reconstitution experiments demonstrated that Jak2 was not
required for the generation of lymphoid progenitors, their
amplification, or their functional differentiation. Parganas et al.
(1998) concluded that Jak2 plays a critical, nonredundant role in the
function of a specific group of cytokine receptors.

Neubauer et al. (1998) also performed a targeted inactivation of Jak2 in
mice. Jak2 -/- embryos were anemic and died around day 12.5 postcoitum.
Primitive erythrocytes were found, but definitive erythropoiesis was
absent. Compared to erythropoietin receptor-deficient mice, the
phenotype of Jak2 deficiency was more severe. Fetal liver BFU-E and
CFU-E colonies were completely absent. However, multilineage
hematopoietic stem cells (CD34-low, c-kit-pos) were found, and B
lymphopoiesis appeared intact. In contrast to IFN-alpha stimulation,
Jak2 -/- cells did not respond to IFN-gamma. Jak2 -/- embryonic stem
cells were competent for LIF signaling. These data also demonstrated
that Jak2 has pivotal functions for signal transduction of a set of
cytokine receptors required in definitive erythropoiesis.

---Polycythemia Vera, Thrombocytopenia, Myelofibrosis, or Erythrocytosis

In 71 (97%) of 73 patients with polycythemia vera (PV; 263300), 29 (57%)
of 51 with essential thrombocythemia (THCYT3; 614521), and 8 (50%) of 16
with idiopathic myelofibrosis (254450), Baxter et al. (2005) identified
a somatic G-to-T transversion in the JAK2 gene, resulting in a
val617-to-phe (V617F) substitution in the negative regulatory JH2
domain. The mutation was predicted to dysregulate kinase activity. It
was heterozygous in most patients, homozygous in a subset as the result
of mitotic recombination, and arose in a multipotent progenitor capable
of giving rise to erythroid and myeloid cells.

In all 51 patients with loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 9p,
Kralovics et al. (2005) identified a somatic V617F mutation. Of 193
patients without 9p LOH, 66 were heterozygous for V617F and 127 did not
have the mutation. The frequency of V617F was 65% (83 of 128) among
patients with polycythemia vera, 57% (13 of 23) among patients with
idiopathic myelofibrosis, and 23% (21 of 93) among patients with
essential thrombocythemia.

James et al. (2005) identified a somatic V617F mutation in 40 of 45
patients with polycythemia vera. They found that the mutation leads to
constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation activity that promotes cytokine
hypersensitivity and induces erythrocytosis in a mouse model.

Jamieson et al. (2006) identified the V617F mutation in peripheral blood
and bone marrow cells in 14 of 16 PV patients. In all PV peripheral
blood samples analyzed, there were increased numbers of hematopoietic
stem cells compared to controls. The V617F mutation was detected in
hematopoietic stem cells of all 6 PV samples examined further, and those
stem cells showed skewed differentiation towards the erythroid lineage.
However, the mutation was also identified in most myeloid precursor
cells examined, indicating that the mutation was clonally transmitted to
all stem cell progeny. Aberrant erythroid potential of PV stem cells was
potently inhibited by the JAK2 inhibitor AG490.

An acquired V617F mutation in JAK2 occurs in most patients with
polycythemia vera, but is seen in only half those with essential
thrombocythemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis. Campbell et al. (2005)
attempted to determine whether essential thrombocythemia patients with
the mutation are biologically distinct from those without, and why the
same mutation is associated with different disease phenotypes. The
mutation-positive patients had lower serum erythropoietin and ferritin
concentrations than did mutation-negative patients. Mutation-negative
patients did, nonetheless, show many clinical and laboratory features
characteristic of a myeloproliferative disorder. These V617F-positive
individuals were more sensitive to therapy with hydroxyurea, but not
anagrelide, than those without the JAK2 mutation. Thus, Campbell et al.
(2005) concluded that V617F-positive essential thrombocythemia and
polycythemia vera form a biologic continuum, with the degree of
erythrocytosis determined by physiologic or genetic modifiers.

---Acute Myelogeneous Leukemia

Lee et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for the V617F mutation in
bone marrow aspirates from 2 of 113 patients with acute myelogenous
leukemia (AML; 601626). Neither patient had a history of previous
hematologic disorders and or evidence of erythroid lineage proliferation
on bone marrow biopsy.

---Susceptibility to Pregnancy Loss

Mercier et al. (2007) screened for the JAK2 V617F mutation in 3,496
pairs of women enrolled in a matched case-control study of unexplained
pregnancy loss (see RPRGL1, 614389) and found that the mutation was
significantly associated with the risk of fetal loss (OR, 4.63; p =
0.002) and embryonic loss (OR, 7.20; p = 0.009). The mutation was more
frequent in women with embryonic loss than in those with fetal loss (p
less than 0.001); clinical examination and complete blood count were
normal in all women with the mutation. The increased risks were
independent of those associated with the 1691A mutation in the factor V
Leiden gene (612309.0001) and the 20210A mutation in the prothrombin
gene (176930.0009).

Dahabreh et al. (2008) screened 389 women with a history of at least 3
consecutive early or 1 late pregnancy loss but did not find the JAK2
V617F mutation in any case; the authors concluded that latent maternal
JAK2 V617F-positive myoproliferative neoplasm is an unlikely cause of
miscarriage.

---Budd-Chiari Syndrome

Chung et al. (2006) described Budd-Chiari syndrome (600880) in a
46-year-old woman who was well until the onset of increasing abdominal
distention over a period of several days. She was found to have a
combination of the V617F mutation and the factor V Leiden mutation
(612309.0001). This JAK2 mutation was found by Patel et al. (2006) in a
high proportion of patients with the Budd-Chiari syndrome, providing
evidence that these patients have a latent myeloproliferative disorder.

Sozer et al. (2009) identified somatic homozygous V617F mutations in
liver venule endothelial and hematopoietic cells from 2 unrelated PV
patients who developed Budd-Chiari syndrome. However, analysis of
endothelial cells from a third PV patient with Budd-Chiari syndrome and
in 2 patients with hepatoportal sclerosis without PV showed only
wildtype JAK2. Endothelial and hematopoietic cells are believed to come
from a common progenitor called the hemangioblast. Sozer et al. (2009)
concluded that finding V617F-positive endothelial cells and
hematopoietic cells from patients with PV who developed Budd-Chiari
syndrome indicates that endothelial cells are involved by the PV
malignant process, and suggested that the disease might originate from a
common cell of origin in some patients.

LEUKEMIA, ACUTE MYELOGENOUS, SOMATIC
JAK2, LYS607ASN

In bone marrow aspirate from 1 of 113 patients with acute myelogenous
leukemia (AML; 601626), Lee et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous
1821G-C transversion in the twelfth coding exon (exon 14) of the JAK2
gene, resulting in a lys607-to-asn (K607N) substitution in a conserved
residue in the pseudokinase domain.

.0003
ERYTHROCYTOSIS, JAK2-RELATED, SOMATIC
JAK2, LYS539LEU

Among 10 patients with a diagnosis of polycythemia vera or idiopathic
erythrocytosis (see 133100) who did not carry the V617F mutation in JAK2
(147796.0001), Scott et al. (2007) found 3 alleles carrying a somatic
lys539-to-leu substitution (K539L) in exon 12 of the JAK2 gene. Those
with this and 3 other JAK2 exon 12 mutations presented with an isolated
erythrocytosis and distinctive bone marrow morphology, and several also
had reduced serum erythropoietin levels. Erythroid colonies could be
grown from their blood samples in the absence of exogenous
erythropoietin. All such erythroid colonies were heterozygous for the
mutation, whereas colonies homozygous for the mutation occurred in most
patients with V617F-positive polycythemia vera. The K539L mutation
resulted in a myeloproliferative phenotype, including erythrocytosis, in
a murine model of retroviral bone marrow transplantation.

.0004
THROMBOCYTHEMIA 3
JAK2, VAL617ILE

In affected members of a family with autosomal dominant
thrombocythemia-3 (THCYT3; 614521), Mead et al. (2012) identified a
germline heterozygous G-to-A transition in the JAK2 gene, resulting in a
val617-to-ile (V617I) substitution. The proband presented at age 53
years with an ischemic cerebrovascular event associated with
long-standing thrombocytosis (700 x 10(9) to 970 x 10(9)). There were 5
additional family members with thrombocytosis, including 1 with a
myocardial infarction at age 46 and another with a myocardial infarction
at age 65 and an ischemic cerebrovascular event at age 72. Bone marrow
biopsy showed megakaryocyte hyperplasia without fibrosis. In addition,
none of the patients had splenomegaly or evidence of leukemic
transformation. Examination of peripheral blood cells showed normal
baseline STAT3 (102582) activity and lack of cytokine-independent colony
formation. However, after stimulation with (GCSF; 138970),
V617I-containing CD33+ myeloid and CD34+ stem cells showed a marked
increase in STAT3 levels, particularly in response to low levels of
GCSF, suggesting that the mutation causes limited constitutive
activation with a reduced threshold for cytokine-induced activation.

606078	TITLE *606078 MEGAKARYOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA 1 GENE; MKL1
;;MAL;;
MYOCARDIN-RELATED PROTEIN;;
MRTFA
MKL1/RBM15 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nagase et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding MKL1, which they called
KIAA1438, from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA library. KIAA1438
encodes a predicted 934-amino acid protein. RT-PCR analysis detected
expression of KIAA1438 in all tissues tested, with relatively low levels
in skeletal muscle, pancreas, and spleen. KIAA1438 was expressed in all
brain regions examined. Wang et al. (2001) identified KIAA1438 as a
myocardin (606127)-related protein.

By EST database analysis and PCR, Cen et al. (2003) cloned MKL1. The
deduced 931-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal domain, followed
by a basic region, a glutamine-rich region, a SAP domain, and a
coiled-coil region. Epitope-tagged MKL1 was expressed as a nuclear
protein of about 160 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Cen et al. (2003) found that MKL1 strongly activated serum response
element (SRE)-dependent reporter genes, and it activated the promoters
of smooth muscle alpha-actin (see 102620), cardiac alpha-actin (102540),
and SM22 (600818) more than 200-fold. RNA interference of MKL1 or MKL2
(609463) reduced serum and RhoA (165390) activation in HeLa cells, and
the combination of MKL1 and MKL2 RNA interference completely abolished
induction. Gel mobility shift assays indicated that MKL1 did not bind
the SRE alone, but formed a complex with SRF (600589).
Coimmunoprecipitation assays conformed a direct interaction between MKL1
and SRF. Deletion of the first 250 amino acids of MKL1, including the
N-terminal domain and the basic region, abolished its transcriptional
activity and caused a relocalization of the protein from the nucleus to
the cytoplasm. Transcriptional activity was also lost with C-terminal
deletions and with deletion of the basic region.

Vartiainen et al. (2007) reported a function of nuclear actin in the
regulation of MAL, a coactivator of the transcription factor SRF. MAL,
which binds monomeric actin, is cytoplasmic in many cells but
accumulated in the nucleus upon serum-induced actin polymerization. MAL
rapidly shuttled between cytoplasm and nucleus in unstimulated cells.
Serum stimulation effectively blocked MAL nuclear export, which requires
MAL-actin interaction. Nuclear MAL bound SRF target genes but remained
inactive unless actin binding was disrupted. Fluorescence resonance
energy transfer analysis demonstrated that the MAL-actin interaction
responds to extracellular signals. Vartiainen et al. (2007) concluded
that serum-induced signaling is thus communicated to nuclear actin to
control a transcriptional regulator.

In mice, Ho et al. (2013) found that lamin A/C (150330)-deficient
(Lmna-null) and Lmna(N195K/N195K) (see 150330.0007) mutant cells have
impaired nuclear translocation and downstream signaling of the
mechanosensitive transcription factor Mkl1, a myocardin family member
that is pivotal in cardiac development and function. Altered
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Mkl1 was caused by altered actin dynamics
in Lmna-null and Lmna(N195K/N195K) mutant cells. Ectopic expression of
the nuclear envelope protein emerin (300384), which is mislocalized in
Lmna mutant cells and also linked to Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
(310300) and dilated cardiomyopathy, restored Mkl1 nuclear translocation
and rescued actin dynamics in mutant cells. Ho et al. (2013) concluded
that their findings presented a novel mechanism that could provide
insight into the disease etiology for the cardiac phenotype in many
laminopathies, whereby lamin A/C and emerin regulate gene expression
through modulation of nuclear and cytoskeletal actin polymerization.

- MKL1/RBM15 Fusion Protein

Cen et al. (2003) found that the MKL1/RBM15 fusion protein had a
markedly increased ability to activate SRE reporter genes.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the MKL1 gene,
or KIAA1438, to chromosome 22.

CYTOGENETICS

Mercher et al. (2001) and Ma et al. (2001) demonstrated that the
recurrent t(1;22) translocation in acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL,
FAB-M7) results in the fusion of 2 genes: RBM15 (606077), an
RNA-recognition motif-encoding gene with homology to the spen gene of
Drosophila, and MKL1, a gene encoding an SAP DNA-binding domain. Mercher
et al. (2001) referred to this gene as MAL, for 'megakaryocytic acute
leukemia.' Although both reciprocal fusion transcripts were expressed in
AMKL, the predicted RBM15-MKL1 chimeric protein encompasses all putative
functional motifs encoded by each gene and is thus the candidate
oncogene of t(1;22).

602229	TITLE *602229 SRY-BOX 10; SOX10
;;SRY-RELATED HMG-BOX GENE 10;;
DOMINANT MEGACOLON, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; DOM
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The testis-determining gene SRY (480000) encodes a transcription factor
characterized by a DNA-binding motif known as the HMG (high mobility
group) domain. The SOX gene family consists of genes related to SRY,
with a sequence identity of more than 60% to the SRY HMG box.

CLONING

Using a rat SOX10 cDNA probe to screen a human brain cDNA library,
Pingault et al. (1998) isolated a human SOX10 cDNA predicted to encode a
466-amino acid protein with a highly conserved HMG domain.

Pusch et al. (1998) cloned and sequenced the human SOX10 and the mouse
Sox10 genes, which share 98% amino acid identity. Sequence analysis
suggested that SOX9 (608160) and SOX10 have a common evolutionary
origin. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.9-kb SOX10 mRNA in fetal
brain and in adult heart, brain, small intestine, and colon. Low-level
expression was seen in prostate and testis. In mouse embryos, Sox10
expression was detected in the developing peripheral nervous system,
most prominent in the trigeminal, geniculate, and acoustic ganglia.

Kuhlbrodt et al. (1998) cloned the rat SOX10 gene, which encodes a
466-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of approximately 50 kD.
Northern blot analysis detected a 3-kb SOX10 mRNA transcript that was
largely restricted to glial cells in the adult nervous system. During
development, SOX10 first appeared in the forming neural crest and
continued to be expressed as these cells contributed to the forming
peripheral nervous system and finally differentiated into Schwann cells.
In the central nervous system, SOX10 transcripts were originally
confined to glial precursors and later detected in oligodendrocytes of
the adult brain.

Pingault et al. (2013) demonstrated expression of SOX10 in olfactory
ensheathing cells during development of the peripheral olfactory system
in mice and humans.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pingault et al. (1998) determined that the SOX10 gene contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

Lane and Liu (1984) determined that a mouse model of Hirschsprung
disease (HSCR; 142623), dominant megacolon (Dom), mapped to a
mid-terminal region of mouse chromosome 15 (see ANIMAL MODEL).

Pingault et al. (1997) noted that, in mice, natural and in vitro-induced
mutations affecting the Ret (164761), Ednrb (131242), and Edn3 (131244)
genes generated phenotypes similar to human Hirschsprung disease. Using
polymorphisms for conserved human/mouse genes, Pingault et al. (1997)
established homology between the Dom locus and human chromosome
22q12-q13. Two genes, Smstr3 and Adsl (608222), not previously mapped in
the mouse genome, were also mapped to mouse chromosome 15. The
investigators stated that 3 genes, Smstr3, Lgals1 (150570), and Pdgfb
(190040), are possible Dom candidates, as they did not recombine with
the Dom mutation in a backcross.

GENE FUNCTION

Kuhlbrodt et al. (1998) studied 4 SOX10 mutations found in patients with
Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (WS4; 277580). Unlike the rat SOX10 protein,
which failed to show transcriptional activity on its own, wildtype human
SOX10 displayed a weak, but reproducible, activity as a transcriptional
activator. All mutant SOX10 proteins, including the 1 that lacked only
the last 106 amino acids, were deficient in this capacity, indicating
that the C terminus of human SOX10 carries a transactivation domain.
Whereas all 4 mutants failed to transactivate, only 2 failed to enhance
synergistically the activity of other transcription factors. Synergy
required the ability to bind to DNA and a region in the N-terminal part
of SOX10. Those mutants that failed to synergize were unable to bind to
DNA. Analysis of the naturally occurring SOX10 mutations not only helped
to dissect SOX10 structure, but also allowed limited predictions on the
severity of the disease.

To evaluate further the role of Sox10 in development and disease,
Southard-Smith et al. (1999) performed comparative genomic analyses. An
essential role for the SOX10 gene in neural crest development was
supported by zoo blot hybridizations that revealed extensive
conservation throughout vertebrate evolution and by similar Northern
blot expression profiles between mouse and man.

Potterf et al. (2000) elucidated the hierarchical relationship of 3
transcription factors, MITF (156845), PAX3 (606597), and SOX10, that are
capable of producing several different forms of Waardenburg syndrome,
WS2A (193510), WS1 (193500), and WS4 (277580), respectively. SOX10 was
able to transactivate the MITF promoter 100-fold, and the
transactivation was further stimulated by PAX3. By promoter deletion and
mutation analyses, Potterf et al. (2000) showed that SOX10 can activate
MITF expression through binding to a region that is evolutionarily
conserved between the mouse and human MITF promoters. A SOX10 mutant
that models C-terminal truncations in patients with WS can reduce
wildtype SOX10 induction of MITF, suggesting that these mutations may
act in a dominant-negative fashion. The data support a model in which
the hypopigmentation of WS results from a disruption in function of the
central melanocyte transcription factor MITF.

Bondurand et al. (2000) also showed that SOX10, in synergy with PAX3,
strongly activates MITF expression in transfection assays. Transfection
experiments revealed that PAX3 and SOX10 interact directly by binding to
a proximal region of the MITF promoter containing binding sites for both
factors. Mutant SOX10 or PAX3 proteins failed to transactivate this
promoter, providing further evidence that the 2 genes act in concert to
directly regulate expression of MITF. In situ hybridization experiments
carried out in the dominant megacolon (Dom) mouse confirmed that SOX10
dysfunction impaired Mitf expression as well as melanocytic development
and survival. The authors hypothesized that interaction between 3 of the
genes that are altered in WS could explain the auditory/pigmentary
symptoms of this disease.

Lee et al. (2000) demonstrated that wildtype SOX10 directly binds and
activates transcription of the MITF promoter, whereas a mutant form of
the SOX10 protein (602229.0001) associated with Waardenburg-Shah
syndrome acts as a dominant-negative repressor of MITF expression and
reduces endogenous MITF protein levels. The ability of SOX10 to activate
transcription of the MITF promoter implicates SOX10 in the regulation of
melanocyte development and provides a molecular basis for the
hypopigmentation and deafness associated with WS4.

Connexin-32 (CX32, GJB1; 304040) is a major protein of peripheral
myelin. Mutations in CX32 have been characterized in patients with the
X-linked form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX1; 302800), a
peripheral neuropathy. Bondurand et al. (2001) showed that SOX10, in
synergy with EGR2 (129010), strongly activates CX32 expression in vitro
by directly binding to its promoter. In agreement with this finding,
SOX10 and EGR2 mutants identified in patients with peripheral myelin
defects failed to transactivate the CX32 promoter. In addition, some
CMTX1 patients harbored a T-to-G transversion at position -528 of the
CX32 promoter (304040.0015). The authors demonstrated that this mutation
eliminates binding and activation by SOX10.

SOX10 acts as a critical transactivator of tyrosinase-related protein-1
(TYRP1; 115501) during melanoblast development and as a potent
transactivator of MITF, which is considered to be a master gene that
controls the development and postnatal survival of melanocytes. Khong
and Rosenberg (2002) identified, for the first time, the presence of de
novo cellular immune reactivity against SOX10, using tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes obtained from a 63-year-old woman with metastases of
melanoma refractory to chemotherapy, who was started on a 4-peptide
vaccination protocol. Most of her tumors completely regressed after 2
cycles of immunotherapy, including complete resolution of a large tumor
in her left thigh, an intrapelvic mass, a liver lesion, and most of the
nodules in her lungs. She also developed vitiligo on the dorsal areas of
her hand and distal forearm bilaterally.

The Sox10 and Pax3 transcription factors can directly regulate both MITF
and RET (164761) in a synergistic fashion. Lang and Epstein (2003)
showed that Pax3 and Sox10 can physically interact; this interaction
contributes to synergistic activation of a conserved RET enhancer, and
it explains why Sox10 mutants that cannot bind DNA still retain the
ability to activate this enhancer in the presence of Pax3. However, in
the context of the MITF gene, Pax3 and Sox10 must each bind
independently to DNA in order to achieve synergy. These observations
appear to explain the phenotype in the mild form of Waardenburg syndrome
(WS2E; 611584) caused by a specific SOX10 mutation (S135T; 602229.0005)
in the HMG box that abrogates DNA binding without disrupting association
with PAX3.

Using gene expression profiling, Iwashita et al. (2003) determined that
genes associated with Hirschsprung disease were highly upregulated in
rat gut neural crest stem cells relative to whole-fetus RNA. The genes
with highest expression were GDNF (600837), SOX10, GFRA1 (601496), and
EDNRB. The highest expression was seen in RET (164761), which was found
to be necessary for neural crest stem cell migration in the gut. GDNF
promoted the migration of neural crest stem cells in culture but did not
affect their survival or proliferation. The observations made by
Iwashita et al. (2003) were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, flow
cytometry, and functional analysis.

By expression of Sox9 or Sox10 in early Xenopus embryos, Taylor and
LaBonne (2005) found that each factor could direct the formation of
neural crest precursors and the development of a range of neural crest
derivatives. They detected no differences in the activities of Sox9 and
Sox10 in these assays. They identified Sumo1 (601912) and Ubc9 (UBE2I;
601661) as Sox-interacting proteins that play a role in regulating the
function of Sox9 and Sox10 during neural crest and inner ear
development.

Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF; 118945) is a major mediator of the
protective effects of Schwann cells, both under physiologic and
pathologic conditions. Ito et al. (2006) identified SOX10 as a key
regulator of CNTF expression. Overexpression of Sox10 in cultured
primary Schwann cells from rat sciatic nerves upregulated Cntf protein
levels more than 100-fold. In addition, Cntf expression was
significantly lower in sciatic nerves of Sox10 +/- mice, suggesting that
SOX10 acts as a physiologic regulator of CNTF gene expression in vivo.

The specificity of NFAT complexes on target genes arises from assembly
of NFATc family members (see 600489) with nuclear partner proteins.
Purification of Nfat protein complexes from mouse neural tubes showed
that Sox10 is an Nfat nuclear partner and synergizes with Nfatc4
(602699) to activate Krox20 (129010), which regulates genes necessary
for myelination. Protein domain deletion studies indicated that Sox10
bound to the Rel homology domain of Nfatc4. Using oligonucleotide
affinity purification, Kao et al. (2009) found that Nfatc4 facilitated
Sox10 binding to the NRE4 region of the Krox20 myelin-specific enhancer.
Kao et al. (2009) concluded that NFATc4 and Sox10 cooperate in myelin
gene expression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Waardenburg Syndrome Type 4C

Based on the finding that Sox10 underlies the Dom mouse model (see
ANIMAL MODEL), Southard-Smith et al. (1998) and Herbarth et al. (1998)
considered SOX10 to be a likely candidate for the site of mutations in
individuals with Hirschsprung disease or Waardenburg syndrome whose
disease had not been related to mutations in other genes.

Waardenburg-Shah syndrome, also known as Waardenburg syndrome type 4
(see WS4C; 613266) is characterized by deafness, pigmentary
abnormalities, and Hirschsprung disease. These features are all caused
by defects in the embryonic neural crest. In 4 patients with
Waardenburg-Shah syndrome, Pingault et al. (1998) identified
heterozygous mutations in the SOX10 gene (602229.0001-602229.0004). Each
mutation was predicted to result in loss of function, suggesting that
the pathologic mechanism is haploinsufficiency.

In 2 patients with WS4, Southard-Smith et al. (1999) identified
mutations in the SOX10 gene (602229.0009-602229.0010).

Pingault et al. (2002) identified SOX10 mutations in patients with WS4
with Hirschsprung disease and in patients with WS and intestinal
pseudoobstruction without frank aganglionosis. These results showed that
chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction may be a manifestation associated
with WS, and indicated that aganglionosis is not the only mechanism
underlying the intestinal dysfunction of patients with SOX10 mutations.

Morin et al. (2008) described a de novo missense mutation (602229.0016)
in the gene encoding the SOX10 transcription factor in a Spanish patient
with sporadic WS4.

Bondurand et al. (2007) used a combination of semiquantitative
fluorescent multiplex polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ
hybridization to search for SOX10 heterozygous deletions in cases of
Waardenburg syndrome. They described the first characterization of SOX10
deletions (see, e.g., 602229.0012) in patients presenting with WS4.

- Peripheral Demyelinating Neuropathy, Central Dysmyelination,
Waardenburg Syndrome, and Hirschsprung Disease

Of 12 unrelated Waardenburg-Shah syndrome patients recruited by the
Genetic Center at the Necker Hospital in Paris, Touraine et al. (2000)
described 3 patients with growth retardation and a previously unreported
neurologic phenotype with impairment of both the central and autonomic
nervous systems and occasionally neonatal hypotonia and arthrogryposis
(PCWH; 609136). Each of the 3 patients was heterozygous for a SOX10
truncating mutation: tyr313 to ter (Y313X; 602229.0006) or ser251 to ter
(S251X; 602229.0007). The extended spectrum of the WS4 phenotype was
considered relevant to the brain expression of SOX10 during human
embryonic and fetal development. The expression of SOX10 in human embryo
was not restricted to the neural crest-derived cells but also involved
fetal brain cells, most likely of glial origin. The data emphasized the
important role of SOX10 in early development of both neural
crest-derived tissues, namely melanocytes and autonomic and enteric
nervous systems, and glial cells of the central nervous system.

Pingault et al. (2000) described a patient with a heterozygous mutation
in the SOX10 gene (602229.0019) who had peripheral neuropathy with
hypomyelination, deafness, and chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, but
not Hirschsprung disease or pigmentary abnormalities. Chronic intestinal
pseudoobstruction is defined by repetitive episodes or continuous
symptoms of bowel obstruction in the absence of a mechanical occluding
lesion. It differs from Hirschsprung disease by the persistence of
ganglionic cells and nervous plexus in the submucosal compartments of
the bowel.

In an infant with pigmentary abnormalities, deafness, and decreased
myenteric and submucosal ganglion cells in the colon and small bowel,
Inoue et al. (2002) identified a heterozygous truncating mutation in the
SOX10 gene (602229.0011). In addition, the patient had little
spontaneous respiratory or other movement, severe hypotonia, multiple
contractures, undetectable tendon reflexes, and tongue fasciculations.
Histopathologic studies showed an absence of peripheral nerve myelin
despite normal numbers of Schwann cells, and profound dysmyelination in
the CNS.

- Waardenburg Syndrome Type 2E

Bondurand et al. (2007) found 5 different SOX10 deletions (see, e.g.,
602229.0013) in 5 patients with WS2E (611584), making SOX10 a new gene
for that form of Waardenburg syndrome. No SOX10 point mutations were
identified by DNA sequencing of the 3 SOX10 coding exons. Neurologic
phenotypes reminiscent of that observed in variant WS4, i.e., PCWH
syndrome (peripheral demyelinating neuropathy, central demyelination,
WS, and Hirschsprung disease; 609136) were observed in some WS2-affected
patients with SOX10 deletions.

Zhang et al. (2012) performed functional analysis of 4 different
heterozygous truncating mutations in the SOX10 gene, 3 reported by Chen
et al. (2010) (e.g., 602229.0021) and 1 novel (602229.0022). In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the mutant proteins lacked the
ability to transactivate the MITF promoter.

Pingault et al. (2013) analyzed the SOX10 gene in 17 patients with
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia who had been diagnosed with
Kallmann syndrome (see 147950) but who also exhibited at least 1
Waardenburg-like feature, and identified heterozygous SOX10 mutations in
6 of them (see, e.g., 602229.0023). Analysis of SOX10 in 86 more
patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia, 20 of whom had
various nonolfactory, nonreproductive associated anomalies, revealed
heterozygous mutations in 2 patients; 1 of the 2 had hypoacusis and the
other had normal hearing but showed macroscelia. Pingault et al. (2013)
stated that there was no evidence to indicate why a given SOX10 mutation
might be associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia, and
also noted that anosmia and hypogonadism might be underestimated in
Waardenburg syndrome since individuals usually do not spontaneously
complain of anosmia and WS is often diagnosed in childhood.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

In 4 patients with the neurologic variant of Waardenburg-Shah syndrome,
which is also known by the acronym PCWH (peripheral demyelinating
neuropathy, central demyelination, Waardenburg syndrome, and
Hirschsprung disease; 609136), Inoue et al. (2004) identified truncating
mutations in the SOX10 gene; 2 patients, including 1 who had previously
been reported by Jacobs and Wilson (1992), had the Y313X mutation
(602229.0006). All the mutations were located in the last exon (exon 5)
in the 3-prime region of the SOX10 gene. Functional analysis showed that
the truncating mutations suppressed the transcriptional activity of
cotransfected wildtype SOX10 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that
PCWH is caused by dominant-negative mutations. However, 2 truncating
mutations (E189X; 602229.0001 and Y207X; 602229.0009) associated with
the less severe WS4C phenotype ultimately showed different effects.
Northern blot analysis demonstrated that WS4C-associated mutations, but
not PCWH-associated mutations, lead to a reduction in mRNA via the
nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, thereby causing
haploinsufficiency and preventing a dominant-negative effect. Inoue et
al. (2004) noted that the results were consistent with the NMD RNA
surveillance pathway, which typically degrades only transcripts
containing nonsense mutations that are followed by at least 1 intron
(Carter et al., 1996; Nagy and Maquat, 1998), as usually occurs with
WS4C-associated mutations. Accordingly, the PCWH-associated mutations
that occur in SOX10 exon 5 are not followed by an intron, may escape
NMD, and express large amounts of dominant-negative protein. Similar
results were obtained for truncating mutations in the myelin protein
zero gene (MPZ; 159440) that cause distinct myelinopathies. Inoue et al.
(2004) suggested that, in general, the NMD mechanism may function
protectively to convert dominant-negative effects to haploinsufficiency.

ANIMAL MODEL

A mouse model of Hirschsprung disease (HSCR; 142623), dominant megacolon
(Dom), arose spontaneously at the Jackson Laboratory (Lane and Liu,
1984). Megacolon was associated with dominantly inherited spotting.
Dom/+ heterozygous mice displayed regional deficiencies of neural
crest-derived enteric ganglia in the distal colon, whereas Dom/Dom
homozygous animals were embryonic lethal. The Dom locus mapped to a
mid-terminal region of mouse chromosome 15.

Using a positional cloning strategy, Southard-Smith et al. (1998)
identified Sox10 as the gene underlying the Dom Hirschsprung mouse
model. BLAST analysis of the EST database identified the candidate
transcript as Sox10 on the basis of its homology with the 163-bp
sequence of the SRY-like HMG box transcription factor Sox10 (Stock et
al., 1996; Wright et al., 1993). The finding was consistent with Sox10
expression in the 2 principal cell types affected in Dom/+ mice, neural
crest-derived melanocytes and enteric ganglia. In Dom mice,
Southard-Smith et al. (1998) identified a premature termination mutation
of Sox10 underlying the absence of neural crest derivatives. They
demonstrated Sox10 expression in normal neural crest cells, disrupted
expression of both Sox10 and the HSCR disease gene Ednrb in Dom mutant
embryos, and loss of neural crest derivatives due to apoptosis. The
authors concluded that Sox10 is essential for proper peripheral nervous
system development. Herbarth et al. (1998) also showed that the Dom
mutant mouse is caused by a defect in the Sox10 gene and that Sox10 is
an essential factor in mouse neural crest development.

Variability in the disease phenotype of patients with WS4 suggests the
influence of genetic modifier loci in the disorder. Mice heterozygous
for the Sox10(Dom) allele exhibit variability of aganglionosis and
hypopigmentation influenced by genetic background similar to that
observed in WS4 patients. Southard-Smith et al. (1999) constructed
Sox10(Dom)/+ congenic lines to segregate loci that modify the neural
crest defects in the heterozygous mice. Consistent with previous
studies, increased lethality in the heterozygous mice resulted from a
C57BL/6J locus; also, an increase in hypopigmentation was noted in
conjunction with a locus in another strain. Linkage analysis localized a
hypopigmentation modifier of the Dom phenotype to mouse chromosome 10 in
close proximity to a modifier of hypopigmentation for the EDNRB (131244)
mouse model of WS4.

Paratore et al. (2002) used mice with a targeted deletion of the Sox10
gene to study the etiology of Hirschsprung disease. Neural crest-derived
enteric progenitors that were heterozygous for the Sox10 mutation
colonized the proximal intestine but were unaffected in their survival
capacity. However, unlike their wildtype counterparts, mutant enteric
neural crest-derived cells were unable to maintain their progenitor
state and acquired preneuronal traits, which resulted in a reduction of
the progenitor pool size. Thus, the cells that normally colonize the
hindgut were depleted in the Sox10 mutant, causing the distal bowel to
become aganglionic.

Cantrell et al. (2004) tested for association between genes in the
endothelin signaling pathway and severity of aganglionosis in an
extended pedigree of B6C3FeLe.Sox10(Dom) mice. Single-locus association
analysis identified interaction between EdnrB (131244) and Sox10.
Additional analysis of F2 intercross progeny confirmed a highly
significant effect of EdnrB alleles on the Sox10(Dom/+) phenotype. The
presence of C57BL/6J alleles at EdnrB was associated with increased
penetrance and more severe aganglionosis in Sox10(Dom) mutants. Crosses
between EdnrB and Sox10 mutants corroborated this gene interaction, with
double-mutant progeny exhibiting significantly more severe
aganglionosis. The background strain of the EdnrB mutant further
influenced the phenotype of Sox10/EdnrB double-mutant progeny, implying
the action of additional modifiers on this phenotype.

Owens et al. (2005) focused on enteric ganglia deficits in Sox10(Dom)
mice and defined aganglionosis as a quantitative trait in Sox10(Dom)
intercross progeny to investigate the contribution of strain background
to variation in enteric nervous system deficits. The phenotype of
Sox10(Dom/+) mutants ranged over a continuum from severe aganglionosis
to no detectable phenotype in the gut. A SNP-based genome scan in
Sox10(Dom/+) F1 intercross progeny revealed modifier loci on mouse
chromosomes 3, 5, 8, 11, and 14 with distinct effects on penetrance and
severity of aganglionosis.

Using an N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea mutagenesis screen, Matera et al. (2008)
identified Gli3 (165240) as a modifier of Sox10 neurocristopathy.
Heterozygosity for a null mutation of Gli3 increased the penetrance and
severity of the hypopigmentation phenotype of Sox10 +/- mice.

Polanco et al. (2010) showed that transgenic expression of Sox10, a
close relative of Sox9 (608160), in gonads of XX mice resulted in
development of testes and male physiology. The degree of sex reversal
correlated with levels of Sox10 expression in different transgenic
lines. Sox10 was expressed at low levels in primordial gonads of both
sexes during normal mouse development, becoming male-specific during
testis differentiation. SOX10 protein was able to activate
transcriptional targets of SOX9, explaining at a mechanistic level its
ability to direct male development. Overexpression of SOX10 alone was
able to mimic human 46,XX disorder of sexual development (DSD)
phenotypes associated with duplication of chromosome 22q13. Given that
human SOX10 maps to chromosome 22q13.1, Polanco et al. (2010) implicated
SOX10 in the etiology of chromosome 22q13-related DSD.

Cossais et al. (2010) used in ovo electroporation in the developing
neural tube of chicken to determine which regions and properties of
SOX10 are required for early neural crest development. There was a
strict reliance on the DNA-binding activity and the presence of the
C-terminal transactivation domain, and a lesser influence of the
dimerization function and a conserved domain in the center of the
protein. Dominant-negative effects on early neural crest development
were mostly observed for truncated SOX10 proteins, whose production in
patients may be prevented by nonsense-mediated decay. In contrast,
mutant SOX10 proteins that occurred in patients were usually inactive.
The authors proposed that any dominant-negative activity that some
mutants may possess must therefore be restricted to single neural
crest-derived cell lineages or oligodendrocytes at later times.

In SOX10-null mice, Pingault et al. (2013) observed an almost complete
absence of olfactory ensheathing cells along the olfactory nerve
pathway, as well as defasciculation and misrouting of the nerve fibers,
impaired migration of GnRH cells, and disorganization of the olfactory
nerve layer of the olfactory bulbs.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 4C
SOX10, GLU189TER

In a child with bilateral profound hearing loss, short segment
Hirschsprung disease, and pigmentary abnormalities, including white
hair, blue irides with gray speckles, and depigmented skin patches, all
features consistent with WS4C (613266), Pingault et al. (1998)
identified a heterozygous glu189-to-ter mutation (E189X) in the SOX10
gene. The de novo mutation truncated the SOX10 protein, leaving the HMG

WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 4C
SOX10, TYR83TER

In a boy with WS4C (613266) characterized by bilateral profound hearing
loss (treated by a cochlear implant), fair hair and vivid blue eyes, and
chronic bowel problems, Pingault et al. (1998) identified a heterozygous
de novo nonsense tyr83-to-ter mutation (Y83X) in the SOX10 gene. Rectal
biopsy showed that the number of ganglia was dramatically reduced. The
de novo mutation was located upstream of the HMG domain.

.0003
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 4C
SOX10, 6-BP INS, NT482

In a patient with deafness and short segment aganglionosis (613266),
Pingault et al. (1998) found a heterozygous 6-bp insertion (GCTCCT)
between nucleotides 482 and 483 in exon 4 of the SOX10 gene. The
mutation resulted in duplication of arg161leu162 in the middle of helix
3 of the HMG domain. This duplication changed the spacing between 2
highly conserved residues and was likely to disrupt the structure of the
DNA-binding domain.

.0004
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 4C
SOX10, 2-BP DEL, 1076GA

In a patient with HSCR, deafness, and hypopigmentation (613266),
Pingault et al. (1998) identified a heterozygous 2-bp deletion
(1076delGA) in exon 5 of the SOX10 gene, resulting in a frameshift that
altered the mRNA sequence and introduced a premature termination codon
at position 400. This and the other 3 mutations identified by Pingault
et al. (1998) were likely to result in a loss of function, suggesting
that the pathologic mechanism in Waardenburg-Shah syndrome is
haploinsufficiency and that the developmental process is sensitive to
the exact level of the SOX10 product.

.0005
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 2E, WITHOUT NEUROLOGIC INVOLVEMENT
SOX10, SER135THR

In a girl with a mild form of Waardenburg syndrome type 2E (611584),
reported by Hennekam and Gorlin (1996), Bondurand et al. (1999)
identified a heterozygous ser135-to-thr (S135T) mutation in the SOX10
gene. She had cutaneous hypo- and hyperpigmented regions and hearing
loss.

PERIPHERAL DEMYELINATING NEUROPATHY, CENTRAL DYSMYELINATION, WAARDENBURG
SYNDROME, AND HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE
SOX10, TYR313TER

In 2 unrelated patients (one living in Germany and the second in
France), Touraine et al. (2000) observed a neurologic variant of
Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (609136) associated with a tyr313-to-ter
(Y313X) mutation in the SOX10 gene.

In 2 patients with a neurologic variant of Waardenburg-Shah syndrome,
one of whom had previously been reported by Jacobs and Wilson (1992),
Inoue et al. (2004) identified a tyr313-to-ter (Y313X) mutation in the
SOX10 gene. In the 27-year-old male previously reported by Jacobs and
Wilson (1992), the Y313X mutation was the result of a 1-bp insertion
(938insA); in the other patient, an 18-year-old male, the Y313X mutation
was the result of a 939C-G transversion. Both patients had muscle
wasting/atrophy, pes cavus, and areflexia/hyporeflexia, indicating
peripheral neuropathy. Both had developmental delay and hypotonia,
indicative of dysmyelination, with nystagmus and spastic diplegia also
present in the younger patient. Both patients had hypopigmentation and
neurosensory deafness, indicating dysmyelinating Waardenburg syndrome,
and both had long segment Hirschsprung disease.

PERIPHERAL DEMYELINATING NEUROPATHY, CENTRAL DYSMYELINATION, WAARDENBURG
SYNDROME, AND HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE
SOX10, SER251TER

Touraine et al. (2000) found a ser251-to-ter (S251X) truncating mutation
of the SOX10 gene in a child in France with a neurologic variant of
Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (609136). There was no history of either WS or
Hirschsprung disease (142623) in other members of the family.

.0008
PERIPHERAL DEMYELINATING NEUROPATHY, CENTRAL DYSMYELINATION, WAARDENBURG
SYNDROME, AND HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE
SOX10, 12-BP DEL, EXON 5

Inoue et al. (1999) described a patient presenting with a neurologic
variant of Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (PCWH; 609136) characterized by
severe dysmyelination compatible with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (see
312080) and peripheral neuropathy consistent with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease type I (see 118200), in addition to Waardenburg-Hirschsprung
syndrome (277580). In the patient, Inoue et al. (1999) identified a
novel heterozygous 12-bp deletion in exon 5 of the SOX10 gene that did
not disrupt the coding region, but extended the peptide and hence was
thought to act as a dominant-negative allele. There was a 6-bp direct
repeat in the wildtype SOX10 sequence that flanked the deletion,
suggesting that the deletion may have been mediated by DNA polymerase
slippage between these direct repeats. The healthy parents and sibs did
not have this deletion, indicating that this was a de novo mutation.
Deletion started at the second nucleotide of the TAA stop codon,
resulting in disruption of the stop codon, and, by conceptual
translation, an extension of 82 amino acids on the carboxy terminus
without any other alterations in the putative SOX10 protein. The 12-bp
deletion converted the carboxy-terminal codon from TAA (stop) to TGT
(cys).

By in vitro functional expression assays, Inoue et al. (2007) showed
that the 12-bp deletion led to severely diminished transcription and
DNA-binding activity of SOX10. However, the mutant protein did not show
dominant-negative interference with wildtype SOX10 in vitro. Within the
additional 82-amino acid tail, an 11-amino acid region (termed the WR
domain) presumably formed an alpha-helix structure and inhibited SOX10
transcription activity if inserted in the C-terminal half of the
protein. The WR domain also affected other transcription factors with a
graded effect when fused to the C terminus, suggesting that it elicited
a toxic functional activity. Inoue et al. (2007) concluded that the
molecular pathology caused by the 12-bp deletion and its resulting
extension was distinct from that of more common premature termination
mutations. Failure to properly terminate SOX10 translation resulted in
the generation of a deleterious functional domain and a gain-of-function
effect.

.0009
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 4C
SOX10, TYR207TER

Southard-Smith et al. (1999) described heterozygosity for a
tyr207-to-ter (Y207X) mutation in a patient with Waardenburg syndrome
type 4C (613266) manifested by short segment Hirschsprung disease,
profound sensorineural hearing loss, and hypopigmentation on the abdomen
and neck. Both parents were phenotypically normal and neither carried
the mutation. The mutation was in exon 4, 27 residues downstream of the
carboxyl end of the HMG box and 14 residues downstream of the
corresponding site in the Sox10(Dom) mouse where the single basepair
insertion is located.

.0010
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 4C
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 2E, WITH NEUROLOGIC INVOLVEMENT, INCLUDED
SOX10, GLN377TER

In a boy with Waardenburg syndrome type 4C (613266), Southard-Smith et
al. (1999) found a gln377-to-ter (Q377X) mutation that truncated the
SOX10 protein within the transcription modulation domain. The
heterozygous proband had sensorineural deafness and variable diagnoses
of enteric function ranging from hypoganglionosis to long segment
Hirschsprung disease. He also had nystagmus and ataxic cerebral palsy.
His sister was also profoundly deaf and had nystagmus and cerebral
palsy, but did not have Hirschsprung disease (WS2E; 611584).

.0011
PERIPHERAL DEMYELINATING NEUROPATHY, CENTRAL DYSMYELINATION, WAARDENBURG
SYNDROME, AND HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE
SOX10, GLN250TER

Inoue et al. (2002) reported a male infant with peripheral demyelinating
neuropathy, central dysmyelination, Waardenburg syndrome, and
Hirschsprung disease (PCWH; 609136) who was heterozygous for a 748C-T
transition in the SOX10 gene, resulting in a gln250-to-ter (Q250X)
substitution. The patient presented at birth with a white forelock and
hyperpigmented and hypopigmented patches on the face, body, and limbs,
deafness, and chronic ileus. He never passed meconium and required
repeated segmental small and large bowel resections. Myenteric and
submucosal ganglion cells were severely diminished throughout the entire
colon and much of the small bowel. In addition, he had little
spontaneous respiratory or other movement, severe hypotonia, multiple
contractures, undetectable tendon reflexes, and tongue fasciculations.
Histopathologic studies showed an absence of peripheral nerve myelin
despite normal numbers of Schwann cells, and profound dysmyelination in
the CNS. He remained ventilator-dependent his entire life and died at 83
days of age of Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis. The observations suggested
that some SOX10 mutations, such as Q250X, may allow Schwann cells and
oligodendrocytes to proliferate but interfere with further
differentiation to form myelin. In contrast to SOX10 loss-of-function
mutations causing only WS4C (613266), mutations associated with both
peripheral and central dysmyelination may affect pathology through a
dominant-negative mechanism.

.0012
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 4C
SOX10, 1128-BP DEL/3-BP INS

In a 1-year-old boy with Waardenburg syndrome type 4C (613266),
Bondurand et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous deletion that removed
part of exon 5 of the SOX10 gene. The mutation comprised a 1,128-bp
deletion encompassing 740 bp of intron 4 and 388 bp of exon 5, and a
3-bp insertion (697-740_1085del ins CCT). The patient had short-segment
Hirschsprung disease, bilateral sensorineural deafness, hair and skin
hypopigmentation, and bilateral cryptorchidism.

.0013
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 2E, WITHOUT NEUROLOGIC INVOLVEMENT
SOX10, 253-BP DEL

In a 9-year-old boy with Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (WS2E; 611584) and
in his similarly affected brother, Bondurand et al. (2007) identified a
heterozygous 253-bp deletion in the SOX10 gene (219_428+43del). The
deletion removed 210 bp of exon 3 and 43 bp of intron 3. The proband had
profound deafness, pigmentation abnormalities of the skin and eyes, but
no Hirschsprung disease or mental retardation. The patient's mother
exhibited somatic mosaicism for the mutation.

.0014
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 2E, WITHOUT NEUROLOGIC INVOLVEMENT
SOX10, 1,777-BP DEL

In an 8-year-old boy with Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (WS2E; 611584),
Bondurand et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a 1,777-bp
deletion in the SOX10 gene that removed the whole exon 4, 1,112 bp of
intron 3, and 396 bp of intron 4 (429-1112_697+396del). The mutation was
inherited from the mother, who also had WS2.

.0015
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 2E, WITHOUT NEUROLOGIC INVOLVEMENT
SOX10, 1-BP DEL, 506C

In a Japanese girl with Waardenburg syndrome type 2E (611584), Iso et
al. (2008) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (506delC) in exon 4
of the SOX10 gene, predicted to result in a frameshift and premature
termination that would remove the C-terminal part of the HMG domain and
the whole transactivation domain. She had ocular albinism, a white
forelock, and sensorineural deafness.

.0016
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 4C
SOX10, ALA157VAL

In an 18-month old Spanish boy with severe sensorineural hearing loss,
Hirschsprung disease, and heterochromia irides but neither pigmentary
abnormalities in the skin nor white forelock (613266), Morin et al.
(2008) identified a 470C-T transition in the SOX10 gene, resulting in an
ala157-to-val (A157V) change in the predicted polypeptide. The mutation
affects the alanine at position 56 in the highly conserved HMG domain.
The side chain of ala56 participates in interactions between the
N-terminal end of helix 1 and helix 3. Morin et al. (2008) proposed that
the A157V mutation could disturb these interactions through steric
hindrance, destabilizing the HMG domain. The mutation was not present in
the patient's parents, his brother, or in 95 unrelated Spanish controls.

.0017
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 2E, WITH NEUROLOGIC INVOLVEMENT
SOX10, IVS4AS, A-C, -2

In a boy with Waardenburg syndrome type 2E (611584), Sznajer et al.
(2008) identified a heterozygous de novo A-to-C transversion in intron 4
of the SOX10 gene. In addition to sensorineural deafness and vivid blue
eyes, he had neurologic abnormalities, including white matter anomalies,
mental retardation with autistic-like behavior, hypotonia, and a
generalized peripheral neuropathy. Brain imaging showed complete
agenesis of the semicircular canals. Hirschsprung disease was absent.
Sznajer et al. (2008) hypothesized that the mutation decreased the
strength of the acceptor splice site and increased the strength of at
least 1 cryptic site 5 nucleotides downstream. Utilization of this
cryptic site would cause a frameshift and premature termination 46
residues downstream. The mutation was not present in either parent or in
300 control chromosomes.

.0018
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 2E, WITH NEUROLOGIC INVOLVEMENT
SOX10, GLN174PRO

In a 21-month-old boy with Waardenburg syndrome type 2E (611584),
Barnett et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 521A-C transversion in
exon 4 of the SOX10 gene, resulting in a gln174-to-pro (Q174P)
substitution in the highly conserved HMG domain. He had sensorineural
deafness, fair skin and hair pigmentation, multiple tiny lentigines,
cafe au lait spots, and light blue irides, but no evidence of
Hirschsprung disease. He also showed neurologic involvement, with
hypotonia, poor vision with intermittent nystagmus in early life,
inability to fix or follow, and increased muscle tone. Brain imaging
showed absence of the cochlear nerves, absence of the olfactory bulbs,
and brain hypomyelination.

SYNDROME, AND HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE
SOX10, 1-BP DEL, 795G

In a girl with a phenotype consistent with PCWH (609136), Pingault et
al. (2000) identified a de novo heterozygous 1-bp deletion (795delG) in
the SOX10 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. She
had peripheral neuropathy with marked slowing of nerve conduction
velocities resulting in delayed motor development, chronic intestinal
pseudoobstruction, hypolacrimation, absence of sweating, and deafness.
The peripheral nerve histologic features were more consistent with a
developmental dysregulation defect than a degenerative process.

.0020
PERIPHERAL DEMYELINATING NEUROPATHY, CENTRAL DYSMYELINATION, WAARDENBURG
SYNDROME, AND HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE
SOX10, 1-BP DEL, 915G

In a Spanish boy with PCWH (609136), Vinuela et al. (2009) identified a
de novo heterozygous 1-bp deletion (915delG) in exon 5 of the SOX10
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination at residue
306. The patient had Hirschsprung disease since birth and progressive
sensorineural hearing loss associated with hypoplasia of the cochlea. He
had blue eyes, but no pigmentary anomalies of the skin or white
forelock. Neurologic findings included congenital nystagmus and delayed
motor development due to hypotonia and spasticity. Brain MRI showed
central dysmyelinization. Vinuela et al. (2009) noted that the location
of this mutation would cause an escape from nonsense-mediated decay and
generate a dominant-negative effect resulting in neurologic features,
consistent with the findings of Inoue et al. (2004).

.0021
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 2E, WITHOUT NEUROLOGIC INVOLVEMENT
SOX10, 2-BP DEL, 743AG

In a Chinese father and daughter with WS2E (611584), Zhang et al. (2012)
identified a heterozygous 2-bp deletion, 743delAG, in exon 5 of the
SOX10 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination at codon
248 (Glu248fsTer30). The truncated protein lacked the transactivation
domain but retained the DNA-binding domain. In vitro functional
expression studies in human cells showed that the mutant protein was
expressed and localized only to the nucleus, but did not transactivate
the MITF (156845) promoter and acted in a dominant-negative manner.
However, the mutant protein was degraded faster than wildtype SOX10,
which Zhang et al. (2012) postulated may have resulted in
haploinsufficiency and the somewhat mild phenotype. Both patients had
bilateral profound hearing loss and bilateral heterochromia irides, but
no additional features.

.0022
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 2E, WITHOUT NEUROLOGIC INVOLVEMENT
SOX10, 1-BP DEL, 113G

In a Chinese boy with WS2E (611584), Chen et al. (2010) identified a
heterozygous 1-bp deletion (113delG) in exon 3 of the SOX10 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination (Gly38fsTer69). In
functional studies, Zhang et al. (2012) demonstrated that the truncated
protein was expressed and lacked the nuclear localization signal; it
showed localization in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, but did not
transactivate the MITF (156845) promoter, consistent with
haploinsufficiency. The patient had bilateral profound hearing loss and
bilateral heterochromia irides, but no additional features.

.0023
WAARDENBURG SYNDROME, TYPE 2E, WITHOUT NEUROLOGIC INVOLVEMENT
SOX10, 2T-G

In a 26-year-old man with unilateral deafness, white hair, anosmia,
cryptorchidism, and micropenis (WSE2; 611584), Pingault et al. (2013)
identified heterozygosity for a c.2T-G transversion in the SOX10 gene.
Luciferase reporter-gene analysis in transfected HeLa cells showed
reduced or absent transactivation capacity with the mutant compared to
wildtype. The proband's mother also had unilateral deafness, and his
sister was anosmic; their mutation status was unknown.

611059	TITLE *611059 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 82; WDR82
;;TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 113; TMEM113
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

WDR82 is a regulatory component of the mammalian SET1A (611052) and
SET1B (611055) histone H3 (see 602810) lys4 methyltransferase complexes
(Lee and Skalnik, 2005; Lee et al., 2007). WDR82 additionally associates
with multiple protein complexes, including a chaperonin-containing TCP1
(186980) complex and a protein phosphatase-1 (PP1; see 176875) complex
(Lee et al., 2010).

CLONING

In their Figure 3, Lee et al. (2010) showed that the WDR82 protein
contains 7 WD40 domains distributed throughout the molecule.

GENE FUNCTION

By mass spectrometric analysis of nuclear proteins that
immunoprecipitated with WDR82 from HEK293 cell nuclear extracts, Lee et
al. (2010) identified WDR82 as a component of several protein complexes,
including 4 distinct histone H3 lys4 methyltransferase complexes, a
chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex, and a PP1 complex. They
characterized the PP1 complex further and found that it contained PNUTS
(PPP1R10; 603771), TOX4 (614032), WDR82, and any 1 of the 3 catalytic
subunits of PP1, PP1-alpha (PPP1CA; 176875), PP1-beta (PPP1CB; 600590),
or PP1-gamma (PPP1CC; 176914). The complex, which they called PTW/PP1,
had an apparent molecular mass of about 200 kD, suggesting that it
contains 1 molecule of each subunit. Mutation analysis revealed that
human WDR82 interacted with a central domain of mouse Pnuts. WDR82 did
not interact directly with any other human PTW/PP1 subunit. The PTW/PP1
complex efficiently dephosphorylated the isolated C-terminal domain of
the large subunit of mouse RNA polymerase II (POLR2A; 180660) in vitro.
The PTW/PP1 complex was stable throughout the cell cycle in HEK293
cells, but its association with chromatin was regulated. PTW/PP1
associated with chromatin during interphase, was excluded from condensed
chromosomes during early mitosis, and was reloaded onto chromosomes at
late telophase.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TMEM113
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP SHGC-77002). Scott (2007) mapped the TMEM113
gene to chromosome 3p21.1 based on an alignment of the TMEM113 sequence
(GenBank GENBANK AC092045) with the genomic sequence (build 36.2).

147380	TITLE *147380 INHIBIN, ALPHA; INHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Bremner (1989) stated that inhibin, a gonadal glycoprotein hormone which
regulates pituitary FSH (136530) secretion, was postulated to exist in
the 1920s and named in 1932, but 'during the next 40 years...attained
only slightly more scientific credibility than the unicorn.' Inhibin
exists in 2 forms, each of which shares the same alpha subunit and, when
covalently linked to 1 of 2 distinct subunits called beta-a (INHBA;
147290) and beta-b (INHBB; 147390), strongly inhibits pituitary FSH
secretion. On the other hand, the dimers of 2 beta subunits, termed
activin, are potent stimulators of FSH secretion and release in vitro.
These beta subunits share extensive sequence homology with transforming
growth factor-beta (190180).

CLONING

Mason et al. (1986) isolated cDNAs for the 3 inhibin subunits.

MAPPING

Barton et al. (1987, 1989) used cDNAs for the 3 inhibin subunits
isolated by Mason et al. (1986) to map cognate loci in mouse and man by
Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNAs. These experiments
demonstrated that INHA maps to 2q33-qter, INHBA to 7p15-p13, and INHBB
to 2cen-q13. In the mouse the 2 loci that are on chromosome 2 in man
mapped to chromosome 1 and the INHBA gene mapped to mouse chromosome 13.
The region of mouse chromosome 1 that carries other genes known to have
homologs on human chromosome 2q includes the jsd (juvenile
spermatogonial depletion) locus. Adult jsd/jsd mice have elevated levels
of serum FSH in their testes and are devoid of spermatogonial cells. The
possibility that the mutation in jsd involves the INHA or INHBB gene was
investigated by Southern blotting of DNA from jsd/jsd mice and no major
deletions or rearrangements were detected (Barton et al., 1989).

GENE FUNCTION

Ramasharma and Li (1987) reported the identification and
characterization of binding sites for alpha-inhibin on human pituitary
membranes.

By S1-nuclease analysis, Meunier et al. (1988) showed that the inhibin
subunits are expressed in many extragonadal tissues as well as gonadal
tissues, suggesting diverse functions.

Inhibin is normally produced by ovarian granulosa cells. Lappohn et al.
(1989) found that inhibin is produced also by granulosa-cell tumors and
that measurement of serum inhibin levels is a useful early marker for
primary, recurrent, and residual granulosa-cell tumors. The other
clinical application that has been explored is male contraception
through FSH suppression.

Mellor et al. (1998) studied inhibin alpha-subunit gene and protein
expression in prostate cancer. The authors studied mRNA expression by in
situ hybridization and protein localization by immunohistochemistry.
They observed inhibin alpha-subunit mRNA expression and protein
localization in the epithelium of tissues from men with benign prostatic
hyperplasia, in regions of basal cell hyperplasia, and in nonmalignant
regions of tissue from men with high-grade prostate cancer. In the
malignant regions of tissue from men with high-grade prostate cancer,
expression of the inhibin alpha-subunit gene was suppressed and was not
detectable in poorly differentiated tumor cells. These results indicated
that in contrast to ovarian granulosa cell tumors, alpha-inhibin gene
expression is downregulated in poorly differentiated prostate cancer.

Schmitt et al. (2002) examined the INHA gene promoter and gene locus to
determine whether promoter hypermethylation or loss of heterozygosity
(LOH) occurred in DNA from prostate cancer. A 135-bp region of the human
promoter sequence that continued a cluster of CpG sites was analyzed for
hypermethylation. Significant (p less than 0.001) hypermethylation of
the INHA gene promoter occurred in DNA from Gleason pattern 3, 4, and 5
carcinomas compared with nonmalignant tissue samples. A subset of
carcinomas with a cribriform pattern were unmethylated. LOH at 2q32-q36,
the chromosomal region harboring the INHA gene, was observed in 42% of
prostate carcinomas. The authors concluded that these data provided the
first demonstration that promoter hypermethylation and LOH are
associated with the INHA gene and gene locus in prostate cancer.

Thirunavukarasu et al. (2001) reported that the molecular weight
patterns of INHBA and pro-alpha-C (a processed form of the free alpha
subunit) in serum during early pregnancy (less than 19 weeks' gestation)
showed peaks between 25 and 40 kD and approximately 60 kD, consistent
with the presence of known mature and larger precursor inhibin forms.
However, during late pregnancy (more than 19 weeks' gestation), an
increase in the proportion of smaller molecular weight forms (from 2 to
25%) of INHBA and pro-alpha-C of unknown structure were observed in the
less than 30-kD and less than 25-kD regions, respectively. Incubation of
iodinated 30-kD human INHBA with serum or plasma obtained from early or
late pregnancy showed no evidence of cleavage, suggesting that 30-kD
INHBA is not the cleavage precursor. The authors concluded that INHBA
and pro-alpha-C are processed in late pregnancy by more than one
mechanism to form low molecular weight circulating forms of unknown
structure.

Longui et al. (2004) investigated the INHA gene in 46 Brazilian children
with adrenocortical tumors (ADCC; 202300), 39 of whom were heterozygous
carriers of the R337H TP53 mutation (191170.0035). Six patients were
heterozygous for 3 INHA mutations: 127C-G in exon 1 and 3998G-A and
4088G-A in exon 2, leading to P43A, G227R, and A257T substitutions,
respectively. A257T is located in a conserved INHA region, highly
homologous to transforming growth factor-beta; both G227R and A257T
change polarity, and G227R also changes the pH. Longui et al. (2004)
concluded that INHA may be one of the contributing factors needed for
adrenocortical tumor formation in pediatric patients with the R337H TP53
mutation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using embryonic stem cell technology, Matzuk et al. (1992) generated
inhibin-deficient mice, which developed sex cord stromal tumors at an
early age with nearly 100% penetrance, demonstrating that inhibin
functions in vivo as a tumor suppressor in the gonads of mice. Matzuk et
al. (1994) demonstrated that a severe wasting syndrome, which mimics the
human cancer cachexia syndrome, accompanies the development of gonadal
sex cord stromal tumors in inhibin-deficient mice. The cachectic
inhibin-deficient mice developed hepatocellular necrosis around the
central vein and parietal cell depletion and mucosal atrophy in the
glandular stomach, were anemic, and demonstrated severe weight loss.
Activins were elevated more than 10-fold in the serum. In contrast,
inhibin-deficient mice gonadectomized at an early age did not develop
this wasting syndrome; however, these mice eventually developed adrenal
cortical sex steroidogenic tumors with nearly 100% penetrance,
demonstrating that inhibin is also a tumor suppressor for the adrenal
gland.

601155	TITLE *601155 MINOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY ANTIGEN HA-1; HMHA1
;;HISTOCOMPATIBILITY (MINOR) HA-1;;
HLA-HA1;;
KIAA0223
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes directed against minor histocompatibility
antigens of the host were demonstrated in blood from recipients of bone
marrow from donors who were genotypically HLA identical. Clones of such
cytotoxic T cells were isolated from lymphocyte populations in the blood
of patients with severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; see 614395).
These clones were used as reagents to identify 5 nonsex-linked minor
histocompatibility antigens, designated HA-1, -2 (600642) , -3, -4, and
-5 by van Els et al. (1992). Most of the cytotoxic-T-cell clones
isolated from various patients reacted against HA-1 (van Els et al.,
1992). Goulmy et al. (1996) stated that for immune recognition, the
HA-1, -2, -4, and -5 antigens must be presented to cytotoxic T cells by
the major histocompatibility antigen HLA-A2. In this way, they behave
like antigens recognized in an HLA-restricted fashion. The HA-1 antigen
is present in 69% of normal people who express HLA-A2, whereas the
frequencies of the 3 others in this set of HLA-A2-restricted minor
histocompatibility antigens are either high (95% for HA-2); or low (16%
of HA-4 and 7% for HA-5). The HLA-1-restricted minor histocompatibility
antigen HA-3 occurs in 88% of persons positive for HLA-A1. HA-1, -2, -4,
and -5 are inherited independently of the HLA genes; each of them is
encoded by a single gene, and none has a locus within the HLA region
(Schreuder et al., 1993).

GENE FUNCTION

To investigate whether mismatching of minor histocompatibility antigens
contributes to acute GVHD in recipients of genotypically HLA-identical
bone marrow, Goulmy et al. (1996) studied 148 bone marrow recipients and
their sib donors. Fifty pairs were positive for HLA-A1, 117 were
positive for HLA-A2, and 19 were positive for both. The pairs were typed
with cytotoxic-T-cell clones specific for HA-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5. A
mismatch of only HA-1 was significantly correlated with GVHD of grade II
or higher in adults.

Den Haan et al. (1998) identified HA-1 as a nonapeptide derived from a
partial cDNA sequence, designated KIAA0223, derived from the acute
myelogenous leukemia KG-1. HA-1 has the amino acid sequence VLHDDLLEA,
termed HA-1(H). A single amino acid substitution of arginine for
histidine leads to HA-1-negative status, termed HA-1(R). Den Haan et al.
(1998) found that HA-1(H) is presented by its recognizing antigen,
HLA-A*0201, while HA-1(R) is not. The binding affinity of the HA-1(R)
peptide for HLA-A*0201 is 1/12 that of HA-1(H). The authors concluded
that HA-1(R) is a null allele and that only bone marrow transplantation
from an HA-1(R/R) donor to an HA-1(H/H) or HA-1(H/R) recipient, and not
the reverse, would be significantly associated with GVHD. Den Haan et
al. (1998) suggested that HA-1 typing before bone marrow transplantation
of HLA-matched donor-recipient combinations would improve bone marrow
donor selection and prediction of HA-1-induced GVHD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kaminski et al. (2000) determined that the HA-1 gene contains 23 exons
and spans 16 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the KIAA0223
gene to chromosome 19. Kaminski et al. (2000) mapped the HA-1 gene to
chromosome 19p13.3 based on sequence identity shared with a BAC clone
mapped to 19p13.3.

604602	TITLE *604602 RIBOSOME-RECYCLING FACTOR, MITOCHONDRIAL; MRRF
;;RRF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The termination of protein synthesis requires the action of several
auxiliary factors. In bacteria, ribosome-recycling factor (Rrf) is
essential for the release of ribosomes from the mRNA at the stop codon.
Mitochondria perform protein synthesis using a translation system that
has some features reminiscent of prokaryotic translation and other
features that are unique. By searching an EST database using the E. coli
Rrf protein sequence as the query, Zhang and Spremulli (1998) identified
human ESTs encoding mitochondrial ribosome-recycling factor (MRRF). They
assembled the complete MRRF coding sequence using ESTs. Sequence
analysis of the deduced 263-amino acid MRRF protein indicated that it is
likely localized in the mitochondria; however, MRRF does not have a
clear cleavage signal for removal of the signal peptide. Human MRRF
shares approximately 25 to 30% amino acid sequence identity with
bacterial RRFs.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro assays with recombinant human proteins, Tsuboi et al.
(2009) showed that RRF interacted directly with EFG2 (GFM2; 606544) and
that both were required for ribosome dissociation from mRNA. GTP, but
not GTP hydrolysis, was also required. GTP hydrolysis by EFG2 appeared
to follow the ribosome splitting reaction and occurred on the ribosomal
large subunit. EFG2 and RRF remained on the large subunit until GTP was
hydrolyzed and prevented reassociation of subunits.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hansen et al. (2000) assigned the MRRF
gene to chromosome 9q32-q34.1.

608112	TITLE *608112 TRAFFICKING PROTEIN, KINESIN-BINDING 1; TRAK1
;;OGT-INTERACTING PROTEIN, 106-KD; OIP106;;
KIAA1042;;
MILTON, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned KIAA1042. The deduced protein
contains 953 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression of
OIP106 in spinal cord and moderate expression in all other tissues and
specific brain regions examined.

By searching a sequence database for homologs of rat Oip98 (ALS2CR3;
607334), Iyer et al. (2003) identified KIAA1042, which they designated
OIP106. OIP106 contains coiled-coil domains. Confocal and electron
microscopy showed that OIP106 colocalized with RNA polymerase II (see
180660) in nuclear puncta in HeLa cells. In vitro translation
synthesized a protein with an apparent molecular mass of about 115 kD by
SDS/PAGE. Western blot analysis detected a 115-kD OIP106 protein in HeLa
cell lysates. Further analysis revealed expression of OIP106 in all cell
lines examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Iyer et al. (2003) found that OIP106 interacted with the
tetratricopeptide repeats of OGT (300255) and was O-glycosylated by OGT.
However, unlike other O-glycosylation substrates, OIP106 formed stable
in vitro and in vivo associations with OGT. Coimmunoprecipitations
confirmed that OIP106 interacts with RNA polymerase II and with OGT in
vivo.

Numerous studies have shown that neuroreceptors, including
gamma-aminobutyric acid type A, or GABA(A), receptors, are not
stationary structures on the cell surface. Instead, they undergo a
constant flux whereby surface-bound receptors are endocytosed to form an
intracellular pool, and receptors in this pool are either recycled back
onto the cell surface or shunted toward lysosome-mediated degradation.
Several pieces of evidence suggest that TRAK1, and perhaps TRAK2
(ALS2CR3; 607334), is involved in this trafficking process. Both TRAK1
and TRAK2 are associated with the motor protein kinesin (see 602809)
(Brickley et al., 2005), and TRAK2 can bind to the beta-2 subunit of
GABA(A) receptors (Beck et al., 2002). Based on these observations,
Gilbert et al. (2006) hypothesized that TRAK1 has a crucial role in
regulating the endocytic trafficking of GABA(A) receptors. TRAK1 may
facilitate the targeting of endocytosed GABA(A) receptors back to the
cell surface or block them from degradation. TRAK1 may also be involved
in directing newly synthesized GABA(A) receptors to the cell surface.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the OIP106
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP stSG4620). Gilbert et al. (2006) stated that
this gene, which they referred to as TRAK1, is located on 3p.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hypertonia, which results from motor pathway defects in the central
nervous system (CNS), is observed in numerous neurologic disorders,
including cerebral palsy, stroke, spinal cord injury, stiff-person
syndrome (184850), spastic paraplegia, dystonia, and Parkinson disease.
Mice with mutation in the 'hypertonic' gene (hyrt) exhibit severe
hypertonia as their primary symptom. Gilbert et al. (2006) showed that
Hyrt mutant mice have much lower levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid type
A, or GABA(A), receptors in their CNS, particularly the lower motor
neurons, than do wildtype mice, indicating that the hypertonicity of the
mutants is likely to be caused by deficits in GABA-mediated motor neuron
inhibition. By linkage analysis they localized the mutant gene
responsible for the hyrt phenotype to mouse chromosome 9 in a region
containing the KIAA1042 gene. Mouse KIAA1042 contains 16 exons and
predicts a protein of 939 amino acids. Sequencing of KIAA1042 in hyrt
homozygotes revealed a 20-bp deletion in the last exon of KIAA1042 that
results in a frameshift after amino acid position 824. Given that the
deletion disrupts only the final 12% of the protein, it may result in
partial loss of function.

NOMENCLATURE

Gilbert et al. (2006) noted that the TRAK1 gene was also referred to as
mammalian Milton (Stowers et al., 2002).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Monocyte chemotactic protein-1, a member of the small inducible gene
(SIG) family, plays a role in the recruitment of monocytes to sites of
injury and infection.

CLONING

Yoshimura et al. (1989) isolated a full-length cDNA clone of the MCP1
gene. Southern blot analysis showed that it is present as a single gene
in the genome and is conserved in several primates. MCP1 mRNA was
induced in human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes by
phytohemagglutinin (PHA), lipopolysaccharide, and interleukin-1 (see
147760), but not by IL2 (147680), TNF (191160), or IFN-gamma (147570).
Sequence similarity suggested that MCP1 may be the human homolog of the
mouse competence gene JE.

Furutani et al. (1989) isolated and sequenced cDNA clones having the
identical nucleotide sequence and encoding a gene that they designated
human monocyte chemotactic and activating factor (MCAF). The amino acid
sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence showed the primary
structure of the MCAF precursor to be composed of a putative signal
peptide sequence of 23 amino acid residues and a mature MCAF sequence of
76 amino acid residues. Robinson et al. (1989) reported the complete
amino acid sequence of a monocyte chemotactic factor derived from a
human glioma and called GDCF-2. The amino acid composition of this
protein is the same as that of lymphocyte-derived chemotactic factor
(LDCF), which is thought to account for monocyte accumulation in
cellular immune reactions. The authors used Edman degradation and mass
spectrometry to demonstrate that GDCF-2 consists of 76 amino acid
residues, including 4 half-cysteines at positions 11, 12, 36, and 52.

MAPPING

By analysis of a panel of somatic cell hybrids, Mehrabian et al. (1991)
localized the gene for monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (CCL2) to
chromosome 17. By in situ hybridization, they localized the gene to
17q11.2-q21.1. By a combination of in situ hybridization and a study of
somatic cell hybrids, Rollins et al. (1991) assigned the gene to
17q11.2-q12. They pointed out that CCL2 belongs to a family of cytokines
which can be grouped into 2 subfamilies based on structure and
chromosomal location, namely 17q and 4q. The cytokines on 4q are IL8
(146930), MGSA (155730), and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (see
139110) (Wolpe et al., 1989).

GENE FUNCTION

Using flow cytometry, Corrigall et al. (2001) detected expression of a
functional IL2 receptor of intermediate affinity composed solely of
IL2RB (146710) and IL2RG (308380) on fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS)
obtained from rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis patients. Addition
of recombinant IL2, IL1B (147720), or TNFA independently did not
upregulate expression of the receptors on FLS, but IL2 or IL1B did
significantly increase expression of intracellular
tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and the production of MCP1. Corrigall
et al. (2001) proposed that MCP1 in the synovial membrane serves to
recruit macrophages and perpetuate inflammation in the joints of
patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Aljada et al. (2001) investigated whether insulin (176730) inhibits the
proinflammatory chemokine MCP1, which attracts leukocytes to inflamed
sites and is regulated by NF-kappa-B (see 164011). Insulin was incubated
with cultured human aortic endothelial cells at 0, 100, and 1,000
microU/mL. Intranuclear NF-kappa-B binding activity was suppressed by
approximately 45% at 100 microU/mL and by 60% at 1,000 microU/mL. MCP1
mRNA expression was also suppressed by 47% at 100 microU/mL and by 79%
at 1,000 microU/mL. The authors concluded that insulin at
physiologically relevant concentrations exerts an inhibitory effect on
the cardinal proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kappa-B and the
proinflammatory chemokine MCP1; these effects suggest an
antiinflammatory and potential antiatherogenic effect of insulin.

Sartipy and Loskutoff (2003) showed that insulin induces substantial
expression and secretion of MCP1 both in vitro in insulin-resistant
adipocytes and in vivo in insulin-resistant obese mice (ob/ob). Thus,
MCP1 resembles other genes that remain sensitive to insulin in
insulin-resistant states (e.g., PAI1, 173360). The hyperinsulinemia that
frequently accompanies obesity and insulin resistance may therefore
contribute to the altered expression of these and other genes in insulin
target tissues. These and other results suggested that elevated MCP1 may
induce adipocyte dedifferentiation and contribute to pathologic states
associated with hyperinsulinemia and obesity, including type II diabetes
(125853).

Kanda et al. (2006) found increased abundance of Mcp1 mRNA in adipose
tissue and Mcp1 protein in plasma in genetically obese diabetic (db/db)
mice and in wildtype mice with obesity induced by a high-fat diet.
Insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and macrophage accumulation in
adipose tissue induced by a high-fat diet were reduced extensively in
Mcp1 -/- mice compared with wildtype animals. Acute expression of a
dominant-negative mutant of Mcp1 ameliorated insulin resistance in db/db
mice and in wildtype mice fed a high-fat diet.

In a study of chemokine expression in fibroblasts from patients with
systemic sclerosis (181750) and controls, Galindo et al. (2001) found
that systemic sclerosis fibroblasts displayed increased constitutive
expression of MCP1 mRNA and protein and showed a blunted response to
oxidative stress. In systemic sclerosis skin sections, MCP1 expression
was detected in fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and mononuclear cells,
whereas it was undetectable in normal skin.

Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry studies for MCP1 on
skin biopsy specimens, Distler et al. (2001) found that MCP1 was
expressed by fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and perivascular infiltrates
throughout the skin, in involved as well as uninvolved areas, from 10 of
11 systemic sclerosis patients, whereas no expression of MCP1 was found
in healthy controls. Stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF; see 173430) resulted in a significant increase in MCP1 mRNA and
protein. The chemotactic activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
in systemic sclerosis fibroblast supernatants decreased when
MCP1-blocking antibodies were added. No effect of recombinant MCP1 on
the synthesis of type I collagen (see 120150) was observed. Distler et
al. (2001) suggested that MCP1 may contribute to the initiation of
inflammatory infiltrates in systemic sclerosis, possibly in response to
stimulation by PDGF.

Qian et al. (2011) defined the origin of metastasis-associated
macrophages by showing that Gr1-positive inflammatory monocytes are
preferentially recruited to pulmonary metastases but not to primary
mammary tumors in mice. This process also occurs for human inflammatory
monocytes in pulmonary metastases of human breast cancer cells. The
recruitment of these inflammatory monocytes, which express CCR2
(601267), the receptor for chemokine CCL2, as well as the subsequent
recruitment of metastasis-associated macrophages and their interaction
with metastasizing tumor cells, is dependent on CCL2 synthesized by both
the tumor and the stroma. Inhibition of CCL2-CCR2 signaling blocked the
recruitment of inflammatory monocytes, inhibited metastasis in vivo, and
prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Depletion of tumor
cell-derived CCL2 also inhibited metastatic seeding. Inflammatory
monocytes promote the extravasation of tumor cells in a process that
requires monocyte-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF;
192240). CCL2 expression and macrophage infiltration are correlated with
poor prognosis and metastatic disease in human breast cancer. Qian et
al. (2011) suggested that their data provide the mechanistic link
between these 2 clinical associations.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Modi et al. (2003) identified 3 SNPs that formed a 31-kb haplotype (H7;
see 158105.0001) spanning the CCL2-CCL7 (158106)-CCL11 (601156) gene
cluster on chromosome 17q. The SNPs and the H7 haplotype were
significantly associated with protection from HIV-1 infection (see
609423).

Spina bifida (182940) is one of the most common congenital
malformations. Early first trimester hyperthermia, caused by
infection/fever or use of hot tubs/saunas, is associated with a 2-fold
increase in the risk of spina bifida (see Chambers et al., 1998). This
suggests that processes related to inflammation and elevated body
temperature, in particular signaling by molecules such as chemokines,
may be involved in the etiology of spina bifida. A polymorphism,
A(-2518)G (158105.0003), in the CCL2 gene differentially controls the
level of MCP1 protein that monocytes export following treatment with
interleukin-1-beta (147720) in vitro (Rovin et al., 1999). Cells with
the homozygous AA genotype produce significantly less MCP1 than do cells
with either the AG or GG genotype (Rovin et al., 1999). Furthermore,
genotype for the A(-2518)G polymorphism is associated with severity of
coronary artery disease (CAD) in those with established CAD (Szalai et
al., 2001) and the progression to CAD in patients with HIV
(Alonso-Villaverde et al., 2004). Jensen et al. (2006) hypothesized,
therefore, that the CCL2 A(-2518)G promoter polymorphism would be a
maternal genetic risk factor for spina bifida and, specifically, that
the maternal homozygous AA genotype, by mounting a less vigorous
systemic and/or local response to infection, would confer excess risk.
They tested the hypothesis in 469 families in which at least 1 member
had spina bifida. Their finding that the maternal genotype for the CCL2
A(-2518)G polymorphism is associated with spina bifida was the first
involving an immune/inflammation related gene.

Flores-Villanueva et al. (2005) found an increased risk of developing
tuberculosis (TB; see 607948) in Mexicans and Koreans heterozygous or
homozygous for MCP1 -2518G (dbSNP rs1024611) compared with those
homozygous for -2518A. ELISA analysis showed that TB patients homozygous
for -2518G had the highest plasma levels of MCP1 and the lowest plasma
levels of IL12p40 (IL12B; 161561), and these values were negatively
correlated. Stimulation of monocytes from healthy -2518G homozygotes
with M. tuberculosis antigens also yielded higher MCP1 and lower IL12p40
compared with healthy -2518A homozygotes. Addition of anti-MCP1
increased IL12 production by -2518G homozygotes, whereas addition of
MCP1 reduced IL12 production by -2518A homozygotes. Flores-Villanueva et
al. (2005) concluded that those with the MCP1 -2518GG genotype produce
high concentration of MCP1, which inhibits IL12p40 production in
response to M. tuberculosis and increases the likelihood of TB infection
progressing to active disease.

The results of Thye et al. (2009) did not support an association of MCP1
-12581 with TB.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lu et al. (1998) generated mice with targeted disruption of the MCP1
gene. Despite normal numbers of circulating leukocytes and resident
macrophages, Mcp1 -/- mice were specifically unable to recruit monocytes
72 hours after intraperitoneal thioglycollate administration. Similarly,
accumulation of F4/80+ monocytes in delayed-type hypersensitivity
lesions was impaired, although the swelling response was normal.
Development of secondary pulmonary granulomata in response to
Schistosoma mansoni eggs was blunted in Mcp1 -/- mice, as was expression
of IL4 (147780), IL5 (147850), and interferon-gamma in splenocytes. In
contrast, Mcp1 -/- mice were indistinguishable from wildtype mice in
their ability to clear Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These data indicated
that MCP1 is uniquely essential for monocyte recruitment in several
inflammatory models in vivo and influences expression of cytokines
related to T helper responses.

Recruitment of blood monocytes into the arterial subendothelium is one
of the earliest steps in atherogenesis. MCP1, a CC chemokine, is one
likely signal involved in this process. To test the role of MCP1 in
atherogenesis, Gu et al. (1998) generated low density lipoprotein (LDL)
receptor-deficient mice that were also deficient for Mcp1 and fed them a
high cholesterol diet. Despite having the same amount of total and
fractionated serum cholesterol as LDL receptor-deficient mice with
wildtype Mcp1 alleles, LDL receptor/Mcp1-deficient mice had 83% less
lipid deposition throughout their aortas. Consistent with the monocyte
chemoattractant properties of MCP1, compound-deficient mice also had
fewer macrophages in their aortic walls. Thus, MCP1 plays a unique and
crucial role in the initiation of atherosclerosis. Comparable findings
were reported by Gosling et al. (1999), who reported that absence of the
Mcp1 gene in transgenic mice overexpressing human apolipoprotein B
provided dramatic protection from macrophage recruitment and
atherosclerotic lesion formation, without altering lipoprotein
metabolism.

Gu et al. (2000) demonstrated that Mcp1-deficient mice were unable to
mount type 2 helper cell (TH2) responses. Lymph node cells from
immunized Mcp1 -/- mice synthesized extremely low levels of
interleukin-4, interleukin-5, and interleukin-10 (124092) but normal
amounts of interferon-gamma and interleukin-2. Consequently, these mice
did not accomplish the immunoglobulin subclass switch that is
characteristic of TH2 responses and were resistant to Leishmania major.
The observed effects were direct rather than due to abnormal cell
migration, because the trafficking of naive T cells is undisturbed in
Mcp1 -/- mice despite the presence of Mcp1-expressing cells in secondary
lymphoid organs of wildtype mice. Gu et al. (2000) concluded that MCP1
influences both innate immunity, through effects on monocytes, and
adaptive immunity, through control of T helper cell polarization.

Ambati et al. (2003) found that mice lacking either Mcp1 or its
receptor, Ccr2 (601267), developed cardinal features of age-related
macular degeneration (ARMD; see, e.g., 153800), including accumulation
of lipofuscin in, and drusen beneath, the retinal pigmented epithelium
(RPE), photoreceptor atrophy, and choroidal neovascularization. In
addition there was an age-related accumulation of complement components
and IgG in the RPE of the knockout mice, perhaps reflecting dysfunction
in macrophage recruitment.

Zhou et al. (2006) showed in vitro that MCP1 binding to CCR2 induced a
transcription factor ZC3H12A (610562) that is involved in apoptosis. In
transgenic mice expressing MCP1 in cardiomyocytes, which is a model of
heart failure following cardiac inflammation, they found increased
ZC3H12A expression, increased cell death, and accumulation of ZC3H12A
protein in myocardial vacuoles, characteristic of both human and mouse
heart failure.

CCL2, -2136A-T

Modi et al. (2003) genotyped 9 SNPs spanning the CCL2-CCL7
(158106)-CCL11 (601156) gene cluster on chromosome 17q in more than
3,000 DNA samples from 5 AIDS cohorts (see 609423). Extensive linkage
disequilibrium was observed, particularly for 3 SNPs, -2136T in the CCL2
promoter, 767G in intron 1 of the CCL2 gene (158105.0002), and -1385A in
the CCL11 promoter (601156.0001), that formed a 31-kb haplotype (H7)
containing the 3 genes. The frequencies of these 3 SNPs and the H7
haplotype were significantly elevated in uninfected individuals
repeatedly exposed to HIV-1 through high-risk sexual behavior or
contaminated blood products. Since these chemokines do not bind the
primary HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5 (601373) or CXCR4 (162643), Modi et al.
(2003) proposed that the influence of the H7 haplotype on HIV-1
transmission may result from activation of the immune system rather than
receptor blockage.

CCL2, -2518A-G

Jensen et al. (2006) related maternal homozygosity for the A allele of
the A(-2518)G promoter polymorphism of the CCL2 gene (dbSNP rs1024611)
to susceptibility to spina bifida (182940). The investigation was
initiated because of the relationship between maternal inflammation and
elevated body temperature to the development of spina bifida. The same
polymorphism had been associated with the severity of coronary artery
disease in patients with established CAD (Szalai et al., 2001) and a
progression to CAD in HIV patients (Alonso-Villaverde et al., 2004).

Flores-Villanueva et al. (2005) found that Mexicans heterozygous or
homozygous for -2518G had a 2.3- and 5.4-fold increased risk of
developing active pulmonary tuberculosis (607948), respectively. Among
Korean patients, the increased risk was 2.8- and 6.9-fold higher,
respectively.

Thye et al. (2009) determined the -2518 genotype and additional MCP1
variants in more than 2,000 cases with pulmonary TB and more than 2,300
healthy controls and 332 affected nuclear families from Ghana, West
Africa, and more than 1,400 TB patients and more than 1,500 controls
from Russia. In contrast to the report of Flores-Villanueva et al.
(2005), MCP1 -2518G was significantly associated with resistance to TB
in cases versus controls (odds ratio (OR) 0.81, corrected P value
(Pcorr) = 0.0012) and nuclear families (OR 0.72, Pcorr = 0.04) and not
with disease susceptibility, whereas in the Russian sample no evidence
of association was found (P = 0.86). These and other results did not
support an association of MCP1 -2518 with TB. In the Ghanaian
population, 8 additional MCP1 polymorphisms were genotyped. MCP1 -362C
was associated with resistance to TB in the case-control collection (OR
0.83, Pcorr = 0.00017) and in the affected families (OR 0.7, Pcorr =
0.004). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) and logistic regression analyses
indicated that, in Ghanaians, the effect was due exclusively to the MCP1
-362 variant, whereas the effect of -2518 may in part be explained by
its LD with -362.

605475	TITLE *605475 BAI1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; BAIAP2
;;INSULIN RECEPTOR SUBSTRATE p53; IRSP53
DESCRIPTION Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor-1 (BAI1; 602682) is a secretin
receptor family member whose expression is induced by p53 (191170). Yeh
et al. (1996) cloned a hamster cDNA encoding a 53-kD BAI-associated
protein which, when expressed in mammalian cells, is tyrosine
phosphorylated by the insulin receptor. They termed the protein IRSp53
for insulin receptor substrate p53. The protein contains 521 amino acids
with a calculated molecular mass of 57 kD and is highly expressed in the
brain. The protein appears to be localized primarily in the particulate
fraction of cell lysates. The IRSp53 cDNA was found to encode an
additional protein product of 58 kD (p58) in vivo.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with cytoplasmic BAI1 as bait, followed by
screening of a human fetal brain cDNA library, Oda et al. (1999)
isolated a cDNA encoding BAIAP2 and a splice variant. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 520- and 521-amino acid proteins are homologous to
hamster IRSp53 with identity conserved in the C-terminal SH3 domain.
Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 3.2-kb transcript
primarily in brain with very low levels in placenta, prostate, and
testis as well as ubiquitous expression of a 2.2-kb transcript that is
relatively abundant in liver, prostate, testis, and placenta. The
expression of the 3.2-kb transcript overlaps that of BAI1 in brain
subregions, is similar to that of neuron- and neuroendocrine-restricted
NSE (ENO2; 131360), but different from that of astrocyte-specific GFAP
(137780). Yeast 2-hybrid and GST pull-down analyses with mutated
proteins confirmed that the SH3 domain of BAIAP2 interacts with the
proline-rich cytoplasmic portion of BAI1. Double immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated colocalization of BAI1 and BAIAP2 in the
cytoplasmic membrane, whereas cells expressing BAIAP2 alone showed
diffuse staining of the cytosol and nucleus.

Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA; 125370) is an autosomal
dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
selective neuron death in the dentatorubral and pallidoluysian pathways
and is associated with CAG repeats in the DRPLA gene (607462). Using a
yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human fetal brain cDNA library with
N-terminus-deleted DRPLA as bait, Okamura-Oho et al. (1999) identified
cDNAs encoding human IRSP53. Sequence analysis identified deduced
proteins of 552 and 521 amino acids. The latter sequence is 94%
identical to hamster IRSp53. Northern blot analysis revealed expression
of a 3.0-kb transcript in most tissues examined and a 3.8-kb transcript
mainly in brain, suggesting alternative splicing. After stimulation of
cells with insulin, immunoblot analysis detected a phosphorylated 58-kD
IRSP53 protein which did not enhance binding to DRPLA.
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis and reporter gene assays indicated that
DRPLA and IRSP53 do interact. Confocal microscopy demonstrated
colocalization in perinuclear dots. GST pull-down analysis determined
that the SH3 domain in the C terminus of IRSP53 binds to a proline-rich
region of DRPLA, which may be interfered with by extended polyglutamine
tracts in the form of CAG repeats.

Miki et al. (2000) demonstrated that IRSP53 is the critical linker
between RAC (see 602048) and WAVE2 (605875). Activated RAC binds to the
N terminus of IRSP53, and the C-terminal SH3 domain of IRSP53 binds to
WAVE2 to form a trimolecular complex. From studies of ectopic
expression, Miki et al. (2000) found that IRSP53 is essential for RAC to
induce membrane ruffling, probably because it recruits WAVE2, which
stimulates actin polymerization mediated by the ARP2/3 complex.

By FISH, Oda et al. (1999) mapped the BAIAP2 gene to chromosome 17q25.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Vaults are hollow intracellular organelles with dimensions of about 57
by 32 nm and a nuclear mass of about 13 MD, 3 times the size of a
ribosome. They are composed of a small RNA (VTRNA1-1; 612695), the
100-kD major vault protein (MVP), and minor vault proteins of 193 kD
(PARP4; 607519) and 240 kD (TEP1; 601686). MVP accounts for over 70% of
the particle mass (Izquierdo et al., 1996; Kickhoefer et al., 1999).

CLONING

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer cells frequently overexpress the 110-kD
lung resistance-related protein (LRP). Overexpression of LRP often
predicts a poor response to chemotherapy. By screening a
multidrug-resistant non-P-glycoprotein (see ABCB1; 171050) fibrosarcoma
cell line with an LRP-specific monoclonal antibody, Scheffer et al.
(1995) isolated a cDNA encoding LRP. The deduced 896-amino acid LRP
protein shares 88% amino acid identity with the rat major vault protein
(Mvp). RNase protection assays showed that LRP expression was enhanced
4- to 8-fold in non-P-glycoprotein MDR cell lines.

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Izquierdo et al. (1996) found that
LRP was widely expressed in normal and tumor tissues and showed a
characteristic cytoplasmic granular pattern. High LRP expression was
detected in the epithelial lining of bronchioles and upper and lower
digestive tract, renal proximal tubules, epidermal keratinocytes and
melanocytes, macrophages, and adrenal cortex. Lower and variable
expression of LRP was detected in other tissues. LRP was expressed in
all tumor types tested, and its level of expression fairly reflected the
chemosensitivity of the tumors, with lower expression in highly
chemosensitive tumors. Immunoprecipitated LRP had an apparent molecular
mass of 110 kD by SDS-PAGE.

By EST database analysis, Holzmann et al. (2001) identified a long MVP
splice variant, L-MVP, that contains a 41-bp stretch in the 5-prime
region that is intronic in the shorter S-MVP splice variant. This 41-bp
stretch introduces an upstream ORF encoding a deduced 18-amino acid
peptide. RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression of both variants, and
S-MVP was always the major variant.

Van Zon et al. (2002) identified a central calcium-binding EF-hand motif
and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain in MVP.

Using confocal immunocytochemistry with anti-MVP antibody, Slesina et
al. (2005) found a dense distribution of vault particles in the
cytoplasm of human U373 astroglioma cell line. A punctate staining
pattern was also detected in the nucleus. Cryoimmunoelectron microscopy
revealed clusters of immunogold particles at nuclear pores and in the
nucleoplasm, suggesting that nuclear MVP was also associated with
vaults. Quantification of fluorescent MVP in the cytosol and nucleus of
U373 cells revealed about 5% of MVP in the nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Kickhoefer et al. (1998) found that expression of MVP and VTRNA1-1 and
assembly of vaults increased up to 15-fold in several drug-resistant
cell lines compared with the parental cell lines. They hypothesized that
the absolute vault level in cell lines may dictate the extent of drug
resistance.

Abbondanza et al. (1998) found that MVP coprecipitated with estrogen
receptor (ER, or ESR1; 133430) from nuclear extracts of MCF-7 human
breast cancer cells and that ER associated with intact vaults. Mutation
analysis showed that a central region of ER containing nuclear
localization signals was involved in the interaction. A limited amount
of ER molecules in the nuclear extract appeared to be associated with
MVP. Physiologic concentrations of estradiol increased the amount of MVP
present in MCF-7 nuclear extracts and coimmunoprecipitated with ER. The
hormone-dependent interaction of vaults with ER was reproduced in vitro.
Antibodies to progesterone receptor (PGR; 607311) and glucocorticoid
receptor (GCCR; 138040) also coimmunoprecipitated MVP, but more weakly.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and by in vitro binding assays with
recombinant proteins, Kickhoefer et al. (1999) confirmed direct
interaction between MVP and PARP4, which they called VPARP. The
C-terminal domain was the smallest sequence of PARP4 that could bind
MVP. The PARP-like catalytic domain, when expressed as a recombinant
protein in E. coli, showed ADP-ribosylase activity. Vault particles
purified from rat liver and incubated with radiolabeled NAD showed
prominent ADP-ribosylation of Mvp and some automodification of Parp4.

Holzmann et al. (2001) showed that in vitro translation of L-MVP was low
relative to translation of S-MVP. Mutation of the start codon of the
upstream ORF in the L-MVP transcript reversed the suppression of MVP
translation, suggesting that translation of the upstream ORF controls
expression of the larger protein.

Using yeast 2- and 3-hybrid analysis and mutation analysis, van Zon et
al. (2002) found that MVP molecules interacted with each other via their
coiled-coil domains. MVP also bound calcium, likely via its EF-hand
motif. The N-terminal half of MVP bound a C-terminal domain of VPARP,
but TEP1 did not appear to interact with either MVP or VPARP.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Yu et al. (2002) showed that MPV
interacted with PTEN (601728), a protein phosphatase that can function
as a tumor suppressor. Endogenous PTEN associated with vault particles
isolated from HeLa cells. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the
interaction between PTEN and MVP. Deletion analysis mapped the
interacting regions to the C2 domain of PTEN and the EF-hand motifs of
MVP. The interaction was independent of tyrosine phosphorylation, but
required calcium, consistent with a calcium-induced conformational
change in the MVP EF-hand motifs.

Using human airway epithelial cells, Kowalski et al. (2007) showed that
MVP accumulated rapidly into lipid rafts during Pseudomonas aeruginosa
infection, and this accumulation was markedly reduced in cells from
cystic fibrosis (219700) patients expressing the delF508 mutation
(602421.0001) in CFTR (602421). Immunofluorescence microscopy and
coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated colocalization of
bacteria, CFTR, and MVP, without direct physical association. The outer
core oligosaccharide of P. aeruginosa bound CFTR and was required for
recruitment of MVP to lipid rafts. Small interfering RNA-mediated
knockdown of MVP decreased recruitment of MVP to lipid rafts following
P. aeruginosa infection without affecting NFKB (see 164011) activation,
IL8 (146930) secretion, or apoptosis induction, suggesting a key role
for MVP in bacterial uptake.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lange et al. (2000) determined that the MVP gene contains 15 exons. They
found that the promoter region has an inverted CCAAT box but no TATA
box. They identified several putative promoter binding sites including
an SP1 (189901)-binding site located close to a p53 (191170)-binding
motif. An alternative 3-prime splice site of intron 1 results in a
splicing variant within the 5-prime untranslated region of MVP mRNA.

MAPPING

By FISH, Scheffer et al. (1995) mapped the LRP gene to chromosome
16p13.1-p11.2, in the same chromosomal region as the MDR-associated
genes MRP (ABCC1; 158343) and PRKCB1 (176970). The authors noted that
acute myeloid leukemia patients with a deletion of an MRP gene,
resulting from a chromosome 16 inversion, often have a favorable
outcome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kowalski et al. (2007) found that Mvp -/- mice infected with P.
aeruginosa internalized fewer bacteria in lung epithelial cells than
wildtype mice, resulting in increased bacterial burden in the lung. Mvp
-/- mice also had increased mortality after P. aeruginosa infection.
Kowalski et al. (2007) concluded that MVP contributes to resistance
against P. aeruginosa lung infection.

608073	TITLE *608073 NUCLEOPHOSMIN/NUCLEOPLASMIN FAMILY, MEMBER 2; NPM2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Burns et al. (2003) cloned mouse Npm2 and identified human NPM2. The
deduced human protein contains 214 amino acids and shares 61% identity
with mouse Npm2. NPM2 has a conserved bipartite nuclear localization
signal followed by a stretch of negatively charged glutamic acid and
aspartic acid residues implicated in protamine and histone binding. It
also has several putative serine and threonine phosphorylation sites.
Northern blot analysis of several mouse tissues detected a 1.0-kb
transcript only in ovary, and in situ hybridization revealed expression
limited to growing oocytes. Immunofluorescent localization detected Npm2
within the oocyte nucleus before nuclear membrane breakdown, after which
Npm2 redistributed to the cytoplasm. Following fertilization, Npm2
localized to pronuclei and nuclei of early cleavage embryos through the
8-cell stage. Npm2 was barely detectable in blastocysts.

GENE STRUCTURE

Burns et al. (2003) determined that the mouse Npm2 gene contains 9 exons
and spans about 5.8 kb.

MAPPING

Burns et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Npm2 gene to chromosome 14.

ANIMAL MODEL

Burns et al. (2003) found that female Npm2-null mice showed defects in
preimplantation embryo development, with abnormalities in oocyte and
early embryonic nuclei. Defects included the absence of coalesced
nucleolar structures and the loss of heterochromatin and deacetylated
histone H3 (see 602810), which normally circumscribe nucleoli in oocytes
and early embryos, respectively. In male mice, sperm DNA decondensation
proceeded in the absence of Npm2.

608258	TITLE *608258 DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE IX; DPP9
;;DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE IV-RELATED PROTEIN 2; DPRP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to the catalytic
domain of DPP4 (102720), followed by PCR and 5-prime RACE of skeletal
muscle and chronic myelogenous leukemia (K-562) cell line cDNA
libraries, Olsen and Wagtmann (2002) cloned DPP9. The deduced 863-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 98 kD. An
alternatively spliced transcript cloned from the K-562 cell line cDNA
library lacks exon 2 in the 5-prime untranslated region and encodes the
same deduced protein. Use of an alternate start codon would result in a
DPP9 protein with 29 more amino acids. DPP9 contains an active-site
serine protease motif (GWSYG) and 2 N-glycosylation sites. The order and
spacing of the serine, aspartic acid, and histidine residues that form
the catalytic triad in DPP9 are conserved with DPP4. DPP9 lacks an
N-terminal signal sequence and transmembrane domain. It shares 58% amino
acid identity with DPP8 (606879) and 92% identity with mouse Dpp9.
Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of a 4.4-kb
transcript. Highest expression was in skeletal muscle, heart, and liver,
and lowest expression was in brain. Western blot analysis detected
expression of DPP9 in all cell lines examined, including a
T-lymphoblastoid cell line that does not express DPP4. In vitro
translation resulted in a soluble protein with an apparent molecular
mass of 98 kD by SDS-PAGE.

By PCR, Qi et al. (2003) cloned DPP9 from a colon cDNA library. DPP9
shares 19% amino acid identity with DPP4, with the greatest similarity
in the C-terminal sequences. It shares 20% amino acid identity with
DPP10 (608209). Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of
a 4.5-kb transcript, with highest expression in liver and muscle.
Transcripts of 5.0 and 1.4 kb were also found in liver. Western blot
analysis detected recombinant DPP9 expressed as a cytosolic protein of
100 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By biochemical analysis using several synthetic peptides, Qi et al.
(2003) determined that DPP9 and DPP8 showed prolyl oligopeptidase
activity similar to that displayed by DPP4. Maximum activity was
measured between pH 7.5 and 8.5. Activity was inhibited by broad serine
protease inhibitors, but not by aprotinin, which is specific for
trypsin-like serine proteases.

GENE STRUCTURE

Olsen and Wagtmann (2002) determined that the DPP9 gene contains 22
exons and spans 48.7 kb. The promoter region has features typical for
promoters of housekeeping genes, namely a high GC content, multiple
sites for initiation of transcription, and lack of a TATAA box.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Olsen and Wagtmann (2002) mapped the DPP9
gene to chromosome 19p13.3. They mapped the mouse Dpp9 gene to a region
of mouse chromosome 17 that shows homology of synteny with human
chromosome 19p13.3.

KIAA0986
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the choreoacanthocytosis (200150) critical region on chromosome 9q,
Rampoldi et al. (2001) identified the VPS13A gene, which they called
CHAC. They identified 2 splice variants: transcript A, which contains
exons 1 to 68 and 70 to 73 and encodes a 3,174-amino acid protein, and
transcript B, which contains exons 1 to 69 and encodes a 3,095-amino
acid protein. Northern blot analysis detected 2 bands of high molecular
mass corresponding to the 2 splice variants in all tissues analyzed.
Additionally, RT-PCR detected expression in the erythrocyte precursor
cell line K562. Rampoldi et al. (2001) showed that the CHAC gene encodes
an evolutionarily conserved protein, which may be involved in protein
sorting.

Independently, Ueno et al. (2001) identified the VPS13A gene and found
that it encodes a 3,096-amino acid protein, which they termed chorein.
Northern blot analysis detected a 10-kb transcript in brain, heart,
skeletal muscle, and kidney.

By EST database analysis and RT-PCR of lymphoid cell line and brain RNA,
Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) identified several additional splice
variants of VPS13A generated by exon skipping or utilization of
alternative internal exons. Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR detected
VPS13A expression at variable levels in all tissues examined, and
transcript encoding the 3,174-amino acid protein was the major variant.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rampoldi et al. (2001) determined that the VPS13A gene contains 73 exons
and spans 250 kb. Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) identified 5 additional
alternative exons in the VPS13A gene, exons 7b, 31b, 34b, 68b, and 69b,
but 3 of these, exons 31b, 34b, and 69b, have stop codons in all 3
reading frames.

MAPPING

Rampoldi et al. (2001) mapped the VPS13A gene to chromosome 9q21-q22.
Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) mapped the mouse Vps13a gene to chromosome
19A.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 11 families with choreoacanthocytosis, Rampoldi
et al. (2001) identified 16 different mutations in the VPS13A gene (see,
e.g., 605978.0001).

In 4 affected patients from 3 Japanese pedigrees with
choreoacanthocytosis, Ueno et al. (2001) identified a homozygous
deletion in the coding region of the VPS13A gene (605978.0003).

Among 43 patients with choreoacanthocytosis, Dobson-Stone et al. (2002)
identified 57 different mutations distributed throughout the CHAC gene
(see, e.g., 605978.0004). In 7 patients, only 1 heterozygous mutation
was found; in 4 patients, no disease mutations were found. The authors
noted that small gene deletions or rearrangements may not have been
detected in these patients.

Dobson-Stone et al. (2005) stated that 75 different mutations in the
VPS13A gene had been identified in 58 probands with
choreoacanthocytosis.

CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, ILE90LYS

In a patient with choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Rampoldi et al. (2001)
found compound heterozygosity for a 269T-A transversion in exon 4 of the
VPS13A gene and an insertion of a T between nucleotides 6404 and 6405 in
exon 48. The mutations resulted in an ile90-to-lys (I90K) amino acid
change and a frameshift, respectively.

CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 260-BP DEL

In affected members of 3 Japanese families with choreoacanthocytosis
(200150), Ueno et al. (2001) identified a homozygous 260-bp deletion in
the VPS13A gene, leading to a truncated protein. The families originated
from a small area in Japan, and haplotype analysis indicated a founder
effect. Some of the patients' parents, who were heterozygous for the
mutation, showed a slight degree of acanthocytosis in peripheral blood
but no distinct neurologic abnormalities except for cryptogenic abducens
palsy in 1 parent.

.0004
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, ARG208TER

In 3 patients with choreoacanthocytosis, Dobson-Stone et al. (2002)
identified a 622C-T change in exon 9 of the CHAC gene, resulting in an
arg208-to-ter nonsense substitution (R208X). One patient was homozygous
for the mutation and 2 others were compound heterozygous for R208X and
another CHAC mutation. The R208X mutation had previously been reported
by Rampoldi et al. (2001) in a family with choreoacanthocytosis.

.0005
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 8035G-A

In 2 affected sibs from a Japanese family with choreoacanthocytosis
(200150) with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance, Saiki et al.
(2003) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transversion at the last
nucleotide of exon 57 of the CHAC gene, predicted to induce skipping of
exon 57 and premature termination of the protein. The mutation was not
detected in their unaffected mother. Family history revealed that 3
other living family members were affected and 2 deceased members were
believed to be affected. All 5 living affected members showed
acanthocytosis (approximately 15-20%) and involuntary movements. In an
erratum, the authors stated that an error in sequencing had occurred and
the inheritance pattern should have been reported as autosomal recessive
(pseudodominant). Tomiyasu et al. (2011) identified the 2 mutations in
the VPS13A gene in this family: an 8035G-A transition in exon 57,
causing a frameshift and premature termination (Ile2652HisfsTer12), and
a 1305G-A transition in exon 15, resulting in a trp435-to-ter (W435X;
605978.0010) substitution; the latter mutation was also identified in
the unaffected mother.

.0006
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 1-BP DEL, 6059C

In 2 unrelated males of Ashkenazi Jewish descent with
choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Lossos et al. (2005) identified a
homozygous 1-bp deletion (6059delC) in exon 46 of the VPS13A gene,
predicted to result in premature termination of the protein.

.0007
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 7-KB DEL

In an Iraqi Jewish woman with choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Lossos et
al. (2005) identified a homozygous 7-kb deletion spanning exon 23 of the
VPS13A gene. She had trichotillomania and anxiety but little
neuromuscular involvement.

.0008
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 37-KB DEL

In affected members of 3 French Canadian families with
choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Dobson-Stone et al. (2005) identified a
homozygous 37-kb deletion in the VPS13A gene, resulting in the deletion
of exons 70 through 73. The deletion also encompassed the 2 terminal
exons of the neighboring GNA14 gene (604397). Haplotype analysis
indicated a founder effect.

.0009
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 2-BP DUP, 3556AC

In 2 Mexican mestizo sisters, born of consanguineous parents, with
choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Ruiz-Sandoval et al. (2007) identified a
homozygous 2-bp duplication (3556dupAC) in exon 33 of the VPS13A gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The proband had
onset at age 32 years and showed severe progression of the disorder; at
age 42, she was emaciated, anarthric, and reactive only to simple
commands. In contrast, her sister had onset at age 45 years and
primarily showed motor and verbal tics, paranoid behavior, and
depression.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The E. coli heat-shock protein DnaJ has been implicated in protein
folding, proteolysis, phosphorylation, and replication of phage. By
screening a human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA expression
library with a monoclonal antibody that reacts specifically with human
endothelial cells and monocytes, Chellaiah et al. (1993) isolated cDNAs
encoding DNAJA1, which they named HDJ2. The deduced 397-amino acid
DNAJA1 protein is 32% identical to E. coli DnaJ, with the highest
identity in the N-terminal region. Among the known DNAJ homologs in S.
cerevisiae, DNAJA1 is most identical to YDJ1, which may be involved in
the transport of certain proteins into the mitochondria and endoplasmic
reticulum.

By immunohistochemical analysis and Western blot analysis, Terada et al.
(2005) showed that Dja1 was expressed in mouse testis and prostate.

ANIMAL MODEL

Terada et al. (2005) found that loss of Dja1 in mice led to severe
defects in spermatogenesis that involved aberrant androgen signaling.
Transplantation experiments with fluorescence-tagged spermatogonia into
Dja1 -/- mice revealed a primary defect of Sertoli cells in maintaining
spermiogenesis at steps 8 and 9. In Sertoli cells of Dja1 -/- mice, the
androgen receptor (313700) markedly accumulated with enhanced
transcription of several androgen-responsive genes, including Pem (MUC1;
158340) and testis-derived transcript (TES; 606085). Disruption of
Sertoli-germ cell adherens junctions was also evident in Dja1 -/- mice.
Experiments with Dja1 -/- fibroblasts and primary Sertoli cells
indicated aberrant androgen receptor signaling.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, followed by RT-PCR of human liver mRNA, Rylander
et al. (2001) cloned CYP2S1. The deduced 504-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 55.8 kD. CYP2S1 contains an N-terminal
hydrophobic stretch, a proline-rich region, and a conserved cysteine
predicted to act as the heme iron ligand. CYP2S1 shares highest sequence
similarity with CYP2B6 (123930), CYP2A6 (122720), and CYP2F1 (124070).
Dot-blot analysis of human tissues detected highest CYP2S1 expression in
trachea, lung, fetal lung, stomach, small intestine, and spleen, with
lower expression in colon, appendix, liver, kidney, thymus, substantia
nigra, peripheral leukocytes, and placenta. Northern blot analysis
detected a 2.4-kb transcript with high expression in lung, small
intestine, and spleen and lower expression in colon, liver, kidney, and
peripheral leukocytes. Sucrose gradient fractionation of human lung
tissue colocalized CYP2S1 with ER marker ERP29 (602287), and
immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed localization of CYP2S1 to the
endoplasmic reticulum.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rylander et al. (2001) determined that the CYP2S1 gene contains 9 exons
spanning more than 13 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rylander et al. (2001) mapped the CYP2S1
gene to chromosome 19q13.2.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Eukaryotic RNA polymerase I (pol I) is responsible for the transcription
of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and production of rRNA, the primary
component of ribosomes. Pol I is a multisubunit enzyme composed of 6 to
14 polypeptides, depending on the species. Most of the mass of the pol I
complex derives from the 2 largest subunits, Rpa1 and Rpa2 in yeast.
POLR1B is homologous to Rpa2 (Seither and Grummt, 1996).

CLONING

Seither and Grummt (1996) cloned a mouse cDNA encoding Rpa2, the second
largest pol I subunit. The 3,978-bp open reading frame encodes a
1,136-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 128 kD.
Sequence alignment with the corresponding Drosophila and yeast genes
revealed the same level of sequence similarity among Rpa2 genes as
exists for Rpa1 genes across diverse species.

;;PARVULIN 14; PAR14;;

DESCRIPTION The peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase protein family (PPIases)
consists of the cyclophilin (e.g., PPIA; 123840), FK506-binding protein
(FKBPs, e.g., FKBP1A; 186945), and parvulin subfamilies. PPIases have
diverse functions, but in general they are implicated in the folding,
transport, or assembly of proteins. The human parvulin PIN1 (601052) is
implicated in the regulation of mitosis through interaction with CDC25
(157680) and polo-like kinase-1 (PLX1; see 602098).

CLONING

By searching an EST database using human PIN1 and E. coli parvulin
sequences as probes, followed by screening a lung cDNA library, Uchida
et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding PIN4, which they called PAR14
(parvulin-14). Using a similar method, Rulten et al. (1999) isolated a
cDNA encoding PIN4, which they called EPVH (eukaryotic parvulin
homolog). Sequence analysis predicted that the 131-amino acid PIN4
protein contains a PPIase domain preceded by a 40-amino acid glycine-
and lysine-rich N-terminal sequence. PIN4, however, lacks a WW domain, a
nuclear localization motif, and residues required for phosphoprotein
interactions. Multiple-tissue Northern blot analysis detected variable
expression of an approximately 1.0-kb PIN4 transcript in all tissues
tested, with notably lower expression in neuronal tissue. Transmission
electron microscopy demonstrated preferential localization of PIN4 in
the mitochondrial matrix. Functional analysis failed to show PPIase
activity, possibly due to proteolytic degradation or different substrate
requirements.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PIN4
gene to Xq13 (TMAP sts-H61973).

;;BETA-ACTIN;;
ACTIN, CYTOPLASMIC, 1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

From studies of the amino acid sequence of cytoplasmic and muscle
actins, Vandekerckhove and Weber (1978) concluded that mammalian
cytoplasmic actins are the products of 2 different genes and differ by
many amino acids from muscle actin. In a neoplastic cell line resulting
from treatment of cultured human diploid fibroblasts with a chemical
mutagen, Leavitt et al. (1982) observed a mutant form of beta actin.
Toyama and Toyama (1984) isolated and characterized lines of KB cells
resistant to cytochalasin B. They found that one resistant line had an
alteration in beta-actin. Such cells bound less cytochalasin B than did
parental KB cells. The authors suggested that the primary site of action
of cytochalasin B on cell motility processes is beta-actin.

Using chick beta-actin cDNA as probe, Gunning et al. (1983) cloned
beta-actin and gamma-actin (ACTG1; 102560) from a fibroblast cDNA
library. They noted that the N-terminal methionine is
posttranslationally removed from the mature beta- and gamma-actin
proteins.

MAPPING

Ng et al. (1985) assigned the ACTB gene to 7pter-q22 by Southern blot
analysis of DNA from somatic cell hybrids. Habets et al. (1992)
generated hybrids that harbor only specific regions of human chromosome
7 and assigned the ACTB locus to 7p15-p12.

Ueyama et al. (1996) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map ACTB
to 7p22. By PCR of somatic cell hybrid DNAs, they mapped 4 ACTB
pseudogenes to other chromosomes.

GENE FUNCTION

Interaction of phospholipase D (see PLD1; 602382) with actin
microfilaments regulates cell proliferation, vesicle trafficking, and
secretion. Kusner et al. (2002) found that highly purified globular
actin (G-actin) inhibited both basal and stimulated PLD1 activity,
whereas filamentous actin (F-actin) had the opposite effect.
Actin-induced modulation of PLD1 activity was independent of the
activating stimulus. The effects of actin on PLD1 were isoform specific:
human platelet actin, which exists in a 5:1 ratio of beta- and
gamma-actin, was only 45% as potent and 40% as efficacious as rabbit
skeletal muscle alpha-actin.

Localization of beta-actin mRNA to sites of active actin polymerization
modulates cell migration during embryogenesis, differentiation, and
possibly carcinogenesis. This localization requires the oncofetal
protein ZBP1 (608288), which binds to a conserved 54-nucleotide element
in the 3-prime untranslated region of the beta-actin mRNA known as the
'zipcode.' ZBP1 promotes translocation of the beta-actin transcript to
actin-rich protrusions in primary fibroblasts and neurons. Huttelmaier
et al. (2005) showed that chicken ZBP1 modulates the translation of
beta-actin mRNA. ZBP1 associates with the beta-actin transcript in the
nucleus and prevents premature translation in the cytoplasm by blocking
translation initiation. Translation occurs only when the ZBP1-RNA
complex reaches its destination at the periphery of the cell. At the
endpoint of mRNA transport, the protein kinase Src (190090) promotes
translation by phosphorylating a key tyrosine residue in ZBP1 that is
required for binding to RNA. These sequential events provide both
temporal and spatial control over beta-actin mRNA translation, which is
important for cell migration and neurite outgrowth.

In immunoprecipitation studies of embryonic fibroblasts from wildtype
and knockout mice deficient in the arginylation enzyme Ate1 (607103),
Karakozova et al. (2006) found that approximately 40% of intracellular
beta-actin is arginylated in vivo. In both wildtype and Ate1-null cells
beta-actin was stable, suggesting that arginylation does not induce
beta-actin degradation. Karakozova et al. (2006) found that arginylation
of beta-actin regulates cell motility. The majority of Ate1-null cells
appeared smaller than wildtype cells and were apparently unable to form
a lamella during movement along the substrate. In addition, Ate1-null
cells exhibited apparent defects in ruffling activity and cortical flow.
Karakozova et al. (2006) concluded that arginylation of beta-actin
apparently represents a critical step in the actin N-terminal processing
needed for actin functioning in vivo.

Nitric oxide (NO) is a paracrine mediator of vascular and platelet
function that is produced in the vasculature by NO synthase-3 (NOS3;
163729). Using human platelets, Ji et al. (2007) demonstrated that
polymerization of beta-actin regulated the activation state of NOS3, and
hence NO formation, by altering its binding to heat-shock protein-90
(HSP90, or HSPCA; 140571). NOS3 bound the globular, but not the
filamentous, form of beta-actin, and the affinity of NOS3 for globular
beta-actin was, in turn, increased by HSP90. Formation of this ternary
complex of NOS3, globular beta-actin, and HSP90 increased NOS activity
and cyclic GMP, an index of bioactive NO, and increased the rate of
HSP90 degradation, thus limiting NOS3 activation. Ji et al. (2007)
concluded that beta-actin regulates NO formation and signaling in
platelets.

The mammalian cytoskeletal proteins beta- and gamma-actin are highly
homologous, but only beta-actin is N-terminally arginylated in vivo,
which regulates its function. Zhang et al. (2010) examined the metabolic
fate of exogenously expressed arginylated and nonarginylated actin
isoforms. Arginylated gamma-actin, unlike beta-actin, was highly
unstable and was selectively ubiquitinated and degraded in vivo. This
instability was regulated by the differences in the nucleotide coding
sequence between the 2 actin isoforms, which conferred different
translation rates. Gamma-actin was translated more slowly than
beta-actin, and this slower processing resulted in the exposure of a
normally hidden lysine residue for ubiquitination, leading to the
preferential degradation of gamma-actin upon arginylation. Zhang et al.
(2010) suggested that this degradation mechanism, coupled to nucleotide
coding sequence, may regulate protein arginylation in vivo.

Glinka et al. (2010) noted that the beta-actin mRNA binding protein
HNRNPR (607201) has been identified as a partner of the survival motor
neuron protein (SMN1; 600354) that is deficient in spinal muscular
atrophy. They reported that hnRNPR and beta-actin mRNA colocalized in
axons. Recombinant hnRNPR interacted directly with the 3-prime UTR of
beta-actin mRNA. Suppression of hnRNPR in developing zebrafish embryos
resulted in reduced axon growth in spinal motor neurons, without any
alteration in motor neuron survival. ShRNA-mediated knockdown in
isolated embryonic mouse motor neurons reduced beta-actin mRNA
translocation to the axonal growth cone, which was paralleled by reduced
axon elongation. Dendrite growth and neuronal survival were not affected
by hnRNPR depletion in these neurons. The loss of beta-actin mRNA in
axonal growth cones of hnRNPR-depleted motor neurons resembled that
observed in Smn-deficient motor neurons, a model for the human disease
spinal muscular atrophy. In particular, hnRNPR-depleted motor neurons
also exhibited defects in presynaptic clustering of voltage-gated
calcium channels. Glinka et al. (2010) suggested that hnRNPR-mediated
axonal beta-actin mRNA translocation may play an essential physiologic
role in axon growth and presynaptic differentiation.

- Pseudogenes

Ng et al. (1985, 1985) showed that there are about 20 pseudogenes widely
distributed in the genome. ACTBP1 is on Xq13-q22; ACTBP2, on chromosome
5; ACTBP3, on chromosome 18; ACTBP4, on chromosome 5 and ACTBP5, on
7q22-7qter. All have been mapped in somatic cell hybrids by use of DNA
clones.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Juvenile-Onset Dystonia

In the monozygotic twins reported by Gearing et al. (2002) with
juvenile-onset dystonia (607371), Procaccio et al. (2006) identified a
point mutation in the beta-actin gene that resulted in
arginine-to-tryptophan substitution at position 183 (102630.0001). The
disease phenotype included developmental midline malformations, sensory
hearing loss, and a delayed-onset generalized dystonia syndrome.
Cellular studies of a lymphoblastoid cell line obtained from an affected
patient demonstrated morphologic abnormalities of the actin cytoskeleton
and altered actin depolymerization dynamics in response to latrunculin
A, an actin monomer-sequestering drug. Resistance to latrunculin A was
also observed in NIH 3T3 cells expressing the mutant actin. These
findings suggested that mutations in nonmuscle actins may be associated
with a broad spectrum of developmental malformations and/or neurologic
abnormalities such as dystonia.

Riviere et al. (2012) suggested that this report should be interpreted
with caution given the absence of replication studies and unavailability
of parental DNA.

- Baraitser-Winter Syndrome 1

Riviere et al. (2012) identified heterozygous missense mutations in 10
of 18 patients with Baraitser-Winter syndrome-1 (BRWS1; 243310). In all
cases where parental DNA was available the mutation was shown to have
occurred de novo. Seven of the 10 patients carried a recurrent
arg196-to-his mutation (102630.0002). One carried a different mutation
at the same codon, arg196-to-cys (102630.0003), and the other 2 patients
carried different de novo missense mutations in the ACTB gene.

In a 7-year-old girl with atypical Baraitser-Winter syndrome-1, who did
not exhibit lissencephaly or seizures, Johnston et al. (2013) identified
a de novo missense mutation in the ACTB gene (E117K; 102630.0006).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DYSTONIA, JUVENILE-ONSET
ACTB, ARG183TRP

In the twins with juvenile-onset dystonia (607371) originally described
by Gearing et al. (2002), Procaccio et al. (2006) detected a
heterozygous arg183-to-trp (R183W) mutation in the ACTB gene. The amino
acid substitution was the result of a 547C-T transition in exon 4. The
constellation of malformations exhibited by the patients resembled Opitz
syndrome (300000), but no mutations were found in the MID1 gene (300552)
and no evidence was found for involvement of genes causing the autosomal
form of Opitz syndrome. No mutations in ACTB were identified in the
mother and 2 half brothers. Paternal samples were not available for
analysis.

Riviere et al. (2012) suggested that this report should be interpreted
with caution given the absence of replication studies and unavailability
of parental DNA.

BARAITSER-WINTER SYNDROME 1
ACTB, ARG196HIS

In 7 of 10 patients with Baraitser-Winter syndrome-1 (BRWS1; 243310),
Riviere et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 587 of the ACTB gene, resulting in an arg-to-his substitution
at codon 196 (R196H). In 2 patients from whom parental DNA was available
the mutation was determined to have occurred de novo. This mutation was
not identified in 212 other exomes. Lymphoblastoid cell lines
established from patients carrying this mutation had greatly increased
F-actin content and multiple, anomalous F-actin-rich, filopodia-like
protrusions compared to control cells, resulting in an increased cell
perimeter.

One of the patients found by Riviere et al. (2012) to carry the R196H
mutation had been described by Fryns and Aftimos (2000) as patient 1 in
the original report of Fryns-Aftimos syndrome (606155).

.0003
BARAITSER-WINTER SYNDROME 1
ACTB, ARG196CYS

In an individual with Baraitser-Winter syndrome-1 (BRWS1; 243310),
Riviere et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 586 of the ACTB gene, resulting in an arg-to-cys substitution
at codon 196 (R196C). This mutation was not found in 214 other exomes.

.0004
BARAITSER-WINTER SYNDROME 1
ACTB, LEU65VAL

In an individual with Baraitser-Winter syndrome-1 (BRWS1; 243310),
Riviere et al. (2012) identified a de novo mutation, a heterozygous
C-to-G transversion at nucleotide 193 of the ACTB gene resulting in a
leu-to-val substitution at codon 65 (L65V). This mutation was not
identified in 244 other exomes.

.0005
BARAITSER-WINTER SYNDROME 1
ACTB, ASN12ASP

In an individual with Baraitser-Winter syndrome-1 (BRWS1; 243310),
Riviere et al. (2012) identified a de novo mutation, a heterozygous
A-to-G transition at nucleotide 34 of the ACTB gene resulting in an
asn-to-asp substitution at codon 12 (N12D). This mutation was not
identified in 24 other exomes.

.0006
BARAITSER-WINTER SYNDROME 1, ATYPICAL
ACTB, GLU117LYS

In a 7-year-old girl with atypical Baraitser-Winter syndrome-1 (243310),
who had microcephaly, intellectual disability, and facial dysmorphism
but no lissencephaly or seizures, Johnston et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a de novo c.349G-A transition in the ACTB gene,
resulting in a glu117-to-lys (E117K) substitution. The mutation was not
present in either of her unaffected parents. Patient lymphocytes
demonstrated significantly decreased ability to adhere to a
fibronectin-coated surface and formed few actin-rich protrusions
compared to the parents' lymphocytes. Studies in yeast showed virtually
complete loss of normal polarization of the cytoskeleton with the
mutant, and mutant cells were almost completely resistant to the
depolymerizing agent latrunculin A, suggesting that E117K might result
in strengthened actin monomer-monomer interactions and increased
filament stability.

610874	TITLE *610874 SPERMATOGENESIS- AND CENTRIOLE-ASSOCIATED 1; SPATC1
;;SPERIOLIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis with Cdc20 (603618) N-terminal and
C-terminal sequences as bait to screen a mouse testis cDNA library,
followed by 5-prime RACE of mouse testis cDNA, Goto and Eddy (2004)
cloned mouse Spatc1, which they called speriolin. The deduced 480-amino
acid mouse protein has a calculated molecular mass of 51.4 kD and
contains an N-terminal leucine zipper motif. Northern blot analysis
detected Spatc1 expression exclusively in mouse testis. Western blot
analysis detected Spatc1 in the insoluble fraction of testis tissue.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected Spatc1 in discrete spots in the
cytoplasm of pachytene spermatocytes, spermatocytes undergoing meiotic
division, round spermatids, and condensed spermatids. Spatc1 colocalized
with the centrosomal protein pericentrin (PCNT1; 170285). Studies with
deletion mutants expressed in BALB/3T3 cells showed that centrosomal
localization requires the N-terminal leucine zipper domain. By trypsin
digestion analysis of cell fractions expressing Spatc1 mutants, Goto and
Eddy (2004) concluded that Spatc1 localized to the cytoplasmic face of a
nonmembranous component, such as the centrosome.

GENE FUNCTION

Using GST pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays, Goto and Eddy
(2004) showed that mouse Spatc1 binds Cdc20 and Cdc27 (116946), both of
which are components of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). Yeast
2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that the C-terminal
region of Spatc1 is required for binding to Cdc20. The C-terminal WD
motif (WD7-beta-4) of Cdc20 mediated Cdc20/Spatc1 interaction,
suggesting that the Cdc20 beta-propeller structure is required for
binding to Spatc1. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that Spatc1 binds
centrosomal protein gamma-tubulin (TUBG1; 191135) but not ODF1 (182878)
or ODF2 (602015).

GENE STRUCTURE

Goto and Eddy (2004) determined that the mouse Spatc1 gene contains 5
exons spanning approximately 23.8 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Goto and Eddy (2004) mapped the mouse
Spatc1 gene to mouse chromosome 15D3, which has homology of synteny to
human chromosome 8q24.

RAF1/SRGAP3 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Rapp et al. (1983) cloned a unique acutely transforming
replication-defective mouse type C virus and characterized its acquired
oncogene, called v-raf. The viral genome bears close similarities to the
Moloney murine leukemia virus (see MOS, 190060). The cellular homolog,
c-raf, is present in 1 or 2 copies per haploid genome in mouse and human
DNA. The MIL oncogene, a second oncogene in the avian retrovirus MH2,
which contains the MYC oncogene, is the avian equivalent of the murine
RAF oncogene, i.e., they are identical.

MAPPING

Bonner et al. (1984) assigned the RAF1 gene to chromosome 3p25 by in
situ hybridization. This suggested that RAF1 may be involved in mixed
parotid gland tumors with the t(3;8)(p25;q21) translocation (Mark et
al., 1980, 1982).

Tory et al. (1992) constructed a genetic linkage map of 96 loci on 3p,
extending from the terminal band to the centromere. Multipoint linkage
analysis indicated that the male, female, and sex-averaged maps extend
for 102, 147, and 116 cM, respectively. RAF1 and 16 DNA markers were
localized by fluorescence in situ hybridization. RAF1 was regionalized
to 3p25.

- Pseudogenes

Bonner et al. (1984) showed that RAF2, a processed pseudogene, is on
chromosome 4.

Hiroshige et al. (1986) assigned the RAF2 pseudogene to region 4pter-p15
by the study of hybrid cells containing various chromosome 4 regions.

GENE FUNCTION

The function of RAF1 was reviewed by Li et al. (1991).

Wang et al. (1996) showed that RAF1 can be targeted to the mitochondria
by BCL2 (151430), a regulator of apoptotic cell death. Active RAF1
improved BCL2-mediated resistance to apoptosis. They also showed that
RAF1 phosphorylates BAD (603167).

Alavi et al. (2003) showed that basic fibroblast growth factor (FGFB;
134920) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 192240)
differentially activate Raf1, resulting in protection from distinct
pathways of apoptosis in human endothelial cells and chick embryo
vasculature. BFGF activated Raf1 via p21-activated protein kinase-1
(PAK1; 602590) phosphorylation of serines 338 and 339, resulting in Raf1
mitochondrial translocation and endothelial cell protection from the
intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, independent of the mitogen-activated
protein kinase kinase-1 (MEK1; 176872). In contrast, VEGF activated Raf1
via Src kinase (CSK; 124095), leading to phosphorylation of tyrosines
340 and 341 and MEK1-dependent protection from extrinsic-mediated
apoptosis. Alavi et al. (2003) concluded that RAF1 may be a pivotal
regulator of endothelial cell survival during angiogenesis.

Lorenz et al. (2003) demonstrated that the RAF kinase inhibitor protein
(RKIP; 604591) is a physiologic inhibitor of GRK2 (109635). After
stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors, RKIP dissociates from its
known target, RAF1, to associate with GRK2 and block its activity. This
switch is triggered by a protein kinase C (PKC; see 176960)-dependent
phosphorylation of RKIP on serine-153. Lorenz et al. (2003) concluded
that their data delineate a new principle in signal transduction: by
activating PKC, the incoming receptor signal is enhanced both by
removing an inhibitor from RAF1 and by blocking receptor
internalization. A physiologic role for this mechanism is shown in
cardiomyocytes in which the downregulation of RKIP restrains
beta-adrenergic signaling and contractile activity.

O'Neill et al. (2004) used proteomic analysis of RAF1 signaling
complexes to show that RAF1 counteracts apoptosis by suppressing the
activation of mammalian sterile 20-like kinase (MST2; 605030). RAF1
prevents dimerization and phosphorylation of the activation loop of MST2
independently of its protein kinase activity. Depletion of MST2 from
Raf1-null mouse or human cells abrogated sensitivity to apoptosis,
whereas overexpression of MST2 induced apoptosis. Conversely, depletion
of Raf1 from Raf1 +/+ mouse or human cells led to MST2 activation and
apoptosis. The concomitant depletion of both RAF1 and MST2 prevented
apoptosis.

By creating a kinase-defective version of Raf1 in mice or by using a
Raf1 inhibitor, Noble et al. (2008) showed that Raf1 autophosphorylation
on ser621 prevented its degradation by the proteasome.

Using Drosophila Schneider S2 cells, Rajakulendran et al. (2009)
demonstrated that RAF catalytic function is regulated in response to a
specific mode of dimerization of its kinase domain, which they termed
the side-to-side dimer. Moreover, they found that the RAF-related
pseudokinase KSR (601132) also participates in forming side-to-side
heterodimers with RAF and can thereby trigger RAF activation. This
mechanism provides an elegant explanation for the longstanding conundrum
about RAF catalytic activation, and also provides an explanation for the
capacity of KSR, despite lacking catalytic function, to directly mediate
RAF activation.

Hollander et al. (2010) found that microRNA-212 (MIR212; 613487) was
upregulated in the dorsal striatum of rats with a history of extended
access to cocaine. Striatal miR212 decreased responsiveness to the
motivational properties of cocaine by markedly amplifying the
stimulatory effects of the drug on Creb (123810) signaling. Studies in
rats and HEK cells showed that amplification of CREB signaling occurred
through miR212-enhanced RAF1 activity, resulting in adenylyl cyclase
sensitization and increased expression of the essential Creb coactivator
TORC (see CRTC1; 607536). miR212 activated RAF1, at least in part,
through repression of SPRED1 (609291). Hollander et al. (2010) concluded
that striatal miR212 signaling has a key role in determining
vulnerability to cocaine addiction.

- Oncogenic Function

Shimizu et al. (1985) identified the activated RAF gene in the stomach
cancer of a Japanese patient. Stomach cancer is the most common cancer
in Japan. Fukui et al. (1985) found that transforming DNA in a human
glioblastoma line was apparently the RAF gene. Teyssier et al. (1986)
presented evidence for a relationship of RAF1 to renal cell carcinoma
(144700).

Kasid et al. (1987) transfected tumor cell DNA into NIH/3T3 cells to
demonstrate that a radiation-resistant laryngeal carcinoma cell line
contained altered RAF1 sequences. The karyotype of the tumor cells
showed absence of chromosome 3, and transformed cells had double-minute
chromosomes.

Poulikakos et al. (2010) used chemical genetic methods to show that
drug-mediated transactivation of RAF dimers is responsible for the
paradoxical activation of the enzyme by inhibitors. Induction of ERK
signaling requires direct binding of the drug to the ATP-binding site of
one kinase of the dimer and is dependent on RAS activity. Drug binding
to one member of RAF homodimers (CRAF-CRAF) or heterodimers (CRAF-BRAF)
inhibits one promoter, but results in transactivation of the drug-free
protomer. In BRAF(V600E) (164757.0001) tumors, RAS is not activated,
thus transactivation is minimal and ERK signaling is inhibited in cells
exposed to RAF inhibitors. These results indicated that RAF inhibitors
will be effective in tumors in which BRAF is mutated. Furthermore,
because RAF inhibitors do not inhibit ERK signaling in other cells, the
model predicted that they would have a higher therapeutic index and
greater antitumor activity than mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
(MEK) inhibitors, but could also cause toxicity due to the MEK/ERK
activation. Poulikakos et al. (2010) noted that these predictions were
borne out in a clinical trial of the RAF inhibitor PLX4032, as reported
by Chapman et al. (2009) and Flaherty et al. (2009). The model indicated
that promotion of RAF dimerization by elevation of wildtype RAF
expression or RAS activity could lead to drug resistance in mutant BRAF
tumors. In agreement with this prediction, RAF inhibitors do not inhibit
ERK signaling in cells that coexpress BRAF(V600E) and mutant RAS.

Hatzivassiliou et al. (2010) demonstrated that ATP-competitive RAF
inhibitors have 2 opposing mechanisms of action depending on the
cellular context. In BRAF(V600E) tumors, RAF inhibitors effectively
block the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and
decrease tumor growth. Notably, in KRAS mutant and RAS/RAF wildtype
tumors, RAF inhibitors activate the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway in a
RAS-dependent manner, thus enhancing tumor growth in some xenograft
models. Inhibitor binding activates wildtype RAF isoforms by inducing
dimerization, membrane localization, and interaction with RAS-GTP. These
events occur independently of kinase inhibition and are, instead, linked
to direct conformational effects of inhibitors on the RAF kinase domain.
On the basis of these findings, Hatzivassiliou et al. (2010)
demonstrated that ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors can have opposing
functions as inhibitors or activators of signaling pathways, depending
on the cellular context. The authors stated that their work provided new
insights into the therapeutic use of ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pandit et al. (2007) analyzed the RAF1 gene in 231 individuals with
Noonan syndrome who did not have mutations in the PTPN11 (176876), KRAS
(190070), or SOS1 (182530) genes, and in 6 persons with LEOPARD syndrome
who did not have mutations in PTPN11. They identified 13 different
missense mutations (see, e.g., 164760.0001-164760.0003) in 18 unrelated
patients with NS (NS5; 611553) and 2 missense mutations (164760.0001 and
164760.0004) in 2 patients with LEOPARD syndrome (611554), respectively.
Most mutations altered a motif flanking ser259 located in the CR2
domain, critical for autoinhibition of RAF1 through 14-3-3 (see 113508)
binding. Of 17 NS patients with a RAF1 mutation in either of 2 hotspots
(clustering around ser259 or ser612), 16 (94%) had hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (CMH; see 192600), compared with an 18% prevalence of CMH
among NS patients in general. Pandit et al. (2007) also scanned RAF1
exons mutated in NS and LEOPARD patients in 241 unrelated individuals
with nonsyndromic CMH who did not have mutations in 8 myofilament genes
known to cause CMH, and the authors identified a thr260-to-ile mutation
in the RAF1 gene in 1 patient. Ectopically expressed RAF1 mutants from
the 2 CMH hotspots had increased kinase activity and enhanced ERK (see
176948) activation, whereas non-CMH-associated mutants were kinase
impaired.

Razzaque et al. (2007) analyzed the RAF1 gene in 30 individuals
clinically diagnosed with Noonan syndrome who were negative for
mutations in the PTPN11, KRAS, HRAS (190020), or SOS1 genes, and
identified 5 different missense mutations in RAF1 in 10 (33%)
individuals. The authors noted that 8 of the 10 mutation-positive
patients with 1 of 4 mutations causing changes in the CR2 domain of RAF1
(see, e.g., 164760.0001 and 164760.0003) had hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, whereas the 2 affected individuals with a mutation
leading to changes in the CR3 domain did not (164760.0004). Transfection
studies in HEK293 cells demonstrated that all 5 mutations in RAF1
behaved as gain-of-function mutants with increased kinase and ERK
activation compared with wildtype RAF1.

CYTOGENETICS

Jones et al. (2009) found a tandem duplication at chromosome 3p25 in a
pilocytic astrocytoma (see 137800) that resulted in fusion of exons 1
through 12 of the SRGAP3 gene (606525) to exons 10 through 17 of the
RAF1 gene. The fusion transcript encodes a deduced protein containing
the first 513 N-terminal amino acids of SRGAP3, including the FES
(190030)/CIP4 (TRIP10; 604504) homology domain, fused to 318 C-terminal
amino acids of RAF1, including the entire RAF1 kinase domain. The fusion
protein showed higher activity than wildtype RAF1 in phosphorylation of
endogenous Mek1 in mouse fibroblasts, and it conferred
anchorage-independent cell growth.

ANIMAL MODEL

To examine the in vivo role of RAF1 in the heart, Yamaguchi et al.
(2004) generated cardiac muscle-specific Raf1 conditionally deleted
mice. The mice demonstrated left ventricular systolic dysfunction and
heart dilation without cardiac hypertrophy or lethality, and showed a
significant increase in the number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes. The
expression level and activation of MEK1/2 (see 176872 and 601263,
respectively) and ERK (see 601795) showed no difference, but the kinase
activity of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1; 602448), JNK
(see 601158), and p38 (600289) increased significantly compared to that
of controls. The ablation of ASK1 rescued heart dysfunction and
dilatation as well as cardiac fibrosis. Yamaguchi et al. (2004)
concluded that RAF1 promotes cardiomyocyte survival through a
MEK/ERK-independent mechanism.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NOONAN SYNDROME 5
LEOPARD SYNDROME 2, INCLUDED
RAF1, SER257LEU

In 7 unrelated patients with Noonan syndrome (NS5; 611553) and 1 patient
with LEOPARD syndrome-2 (611554), Pandit et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 770C-T transition in exon 7 of the RAF1 gene,
resulting in a ser257-to-leu (S257L) substitution at a conserved residue
in the CR2 domain. All patients had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH),
including a 3.6-year-old girl with CMH at birth and a 35-year-old woman
with LEOPARD syndrome. Ectopically expressed S257L mutants demonstrated
increased kinase activity and enhanced ERK (see 176948) activation.

Razzaque et al. (2007) identified the S257L mutation of the RAF1 gene in
4 unrelated patients with Noonan syndrome, 3 with obstructive and 1 with
nonobstructive CMH. The mutation was not found in 100 control
individuals or in 100 patients with CMH without Noonan syndrome.

.0002
NOONAN SYNDROME 5
RAF1, PRO261SER

In 5 affected individuals of 2 unrelated families with Noonan syndrome
(NS5; 611553), Pandit et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a
781C-T transition in exon 7 of the RAF1 gene, resulting in a
pro261-to-ser (P261S) substitution at a conserved residue in the CR2
domain. Four of the 5 patients had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH);
the 1 individual with a P261S change but without CMH was a 6-year-old
girl whose 38-year-old mother had the same mutation and had been
diagnosed with CMH at 23 years of age. The mutation was not found in 210
control individuals.

Razzaque et al. (2007) identified the P261S mutation in 3 Noonan
syndrome patients, a 1-year-old boy and his 33-year-old father and an
unrelated 16-year-old boy. All 3 displayed CMH. The mutation was not
found in 100 control individuals or in 100 individuals with CMH without
Noonan syndrome. Transfection studies in HEK293 cells demonstrated that
P261S behaved as a gain-of-function mutant with increased kinase and ERK
(see 176948) activation compared with wildtype RAF1.

.0003
NOONAN SYNDROME 5
RAF1, THR491ARG

In a sister and brother with Noonan syndrome (NS5; 611553), Pandit et
al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a 1472C-G transversion in exon
14 of the RAF1 gene, resulting in a thr491-to-arg (T491R) substitution
in the CR3 domain. Neither sib had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The
mutation was not found in 210 control individuals.

.0004
LEOPARD SYNDROME 2
NOONAN SYNDROME 5, INCLUDED
RAF1, LEU613VAL

In a 43-year-old woman with LEOPARD syndrome-2 (611554), Pandit et al.
(2007) identified an 1837C-G transversion in exon 17 of the RAF1 gene,
resulting in a leu613-to-val (L613V) substitution at a conserved residue
in the C terminus. The patient had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Razzaque et al. (2007) identified the L613V mutation, which they
designated as being located in the CR3 domain of RAF1, in 2 unrelated
boys with Noonan syndrome (NS5; 611553), neither of whom had
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The mutation was not found in 100 control
individuals or in 100 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without
Noonan syndrome. Transfection studies in HEK293 cells demonstrated that
L613V behaved as a gain-of-function mutant with increased kinase and ERK
(see 176948) activation compared with wildtype RAF1.

603304	TITLE *603304 INTERLEUKIN 1 RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED KINASE 2; IRAK2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The interleukin-1 receptor (IL1R) signaling pathway leads to nuclear
factor kappa-B (NFKB; e.g., 164011) activation in mammals. After binding
to IL1 (e.g., 147760), the type 1 IL1R (IL1R1; 147810) associates with
the IL1R accessory protein (IL1RAP; 602626) and initiates the signaling
cascade. Multiple protein kinase activities coprecipitate with IL1R1,
including IRAK1 (300283). By searching EST databases for sequences
similar to IRAK1, Muzio et al. (1997) identified IRAK2. The deduced
protein contains 590 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected an
approximately 4-kb IRAK2 transcript in a variety of adult human tissues.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Lin et al. (2010) reported the crystal structure of the MyD88
(602170)-IRAK4 (606883)-IRAK2 death domain complex, which revealed a
left-handed helical oligomer that consists of 6 MyD88, 4 IRAK4, and 4
IRAK2 death domains. Assembly of this helical signaling tower is
hierarchical, in which MyD88 recruits IRAK4 and the MyD88-IRAK4 complex
recruits the IRAK4 substrates IRAK2 or the related IRAK1. Formation of
these myddosome complexes brings the kinase domains of IRAKs into
proximity for phosphorylation and activation. Composite binding sites
are required for recruitment of the individual death domains in the
complex, which are confirmed by mutagenesis and previously identified
signaling mutations. Specificities of myddosome formation are dictated
by both molecular complementation and correspondence of surface
electrostatics.

GENE FUNCTION

Muzio et al. (1997) showed that ectopic expression of IRAK2 protein
induced NFKB activation, whereas expression of truncated IRAK2 proteins
did not. Truncated forms of IRAK2 acted as dominant-negative inhibitors
of IL1R-induced NFKB activity. IRAK2 coprecipitated with MYD88 (602170)
and TRAF6 (602355), another protein implicated in the IL1 signaling
pathway and shown to complex with IRAK1. Muzio et al. (1997) concluded
that IRAK2 is a proximal mediator of IL1, is a component of the IL1R
signaling complex, and is required for IL1R-induced NFKB activation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Conner et al. (2009) detected an earlier, more potent Toll-like receptor
(TLR; see 603030)-mediated induction of Il6 (147620) transcription in a
wild-derived mouse strain, MOLF/Ei, compared with the classical inbred
strain C57BL/6J. The phenotype correlated with increased activity of the
I-kappa-B kinase (see 600664) axis and p38 (MAPK14; 600289), but not
Mapk1 (176948), Mapk3 (601795), or Mapk8 (601158). The trait was mapped
to the Why1 locus, which contains Irak2, on mouse chromosome 6. Conner
et al. (2009) showed that, in the MOLF/Ei TLR signaling network, Irak2
promoted early NF-kappa-B activity and was essential for p38 activation.
In the MOLF/Ei strain, they identified a 10-bp deletion in the promoter
region of an inhibitory Irak2 variant, Irak2c, leading to an increased
ratio of pro- to antiinflammatory Irak2 isoforms. Conner et al. (2009)
concluded that Irak2 is an essential component of the early TLR response
in wild-derived MOLF/Ei mice and that the pathway of p38 and NF-kappa-B
activation is distinct in this organism.

187680	TITLE *187680 THIOPURINE S-METHYLTRANSFERASE; TPMT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT; S-adenosyl-L-methionine:thiopurine
S-methyltransferase; EC 2.1.1.67) catalyzes the S-methylation of
aromatic and heterocyclic sulfhydryl compounds, including the
antineoplastic agents 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and 6-thioguanine (6TG),
and the immunosuppressant azathioprine (AZA) (Tai et al., 1996).

CLONING

Honchel et al. (1993) isolated a cDNA corresponding to the TPMT gene
from a T84 human colon carcinoma cell cDNA library. The deduced
245-amino acid protein has a molecular mass of 35 kD. COS-1 cells
transfected with the cDNA expressed a high level of TPMT enzyme
activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Szumlanski et al. (1996) determined that the TPMT gene is 34 kb long and
contains 10 exons.

By screening of a phage artificial chromosome library, Krynetski et al.
(1997) isolated clones corresponding to human TPMT, which they
determined spanned 25 kb and contained 9 exons. Differences from the
previously reported gene structure included 17 additional nucleotides
upstream from the transcription start site and a shorter intron 8.

Seki et al. (2000) determined that the TPMT gene spans 27 kb and
contains 9 exons; they did not identify intron 2 reported by Szumlanski
et al. (1996).

MAPPING

Szumlanski et al. (1996) mapped the TPMT gene to chromosome 6 by
analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids and sublocalized it to
6p22.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

- Pseudogene

Lee et al. (1995) identified a processed TPMT pseudogene located on
chromosome 18q21.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

TPMT activity exhibits genetic heterogeneity due to polymorphisms in the
TPMT gene. Weinshilboum and Sladek (1980) found trimodality for red cell
TPMT activity among 298 randomly selected subjects: 88.6% had high
enzyme activity, 11.1% had intermediate activity, and 0.3% had
undetectable activity. This distribution conformed to Hardy-Weinberg
expectations for a pair of autosomal codominant alleles for low and high
activity, TPMT-L and TPMT-H, with frequencies of 0.059 and 0.941,
respectively. Segregation in families ascertained through probands with
undetectable activity was consistent with this hypothesis.

Klemetsdal et al. (1993) found that red blood cell TPMT activity was
8.3% higher in healthy males compared to females.

Cheng et al. (2005) used polymorphisms in the genes encoding TPMT,
gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH; 601509) and the reduced folate carrier
(SLC19A1; 600424) to assess the nature of chromosomal acquisition and
its influence on genotype-phenotype concordance in cancer cells. TPMT
and GGH activities in somatic cells were concordant with germline
genotypes, whereas activities in leukemia cells were determined by
chromosomal number and whether the acquired chromosomes contained a
wildtype or variant allele. Leukemia cells that had acquired an
additional chromosome containing a wildtype TPMT or GGH allele had
significantly lower accumulation of thioguanine nucleotides or
methotrexate polyglutamates, respectively. Among these genes, there was
a considerable number of acquired chromosomes with wildtype and variant
alleles. Cheng et al. (2005) concluded that chromosomal gain can alter
the concordance of germline genotype and cancer cell phenotypes,
indicating that allele-specific quantitative genotyping may be required
to define cancer pharmacogenomics unequivocally.

- Relation of TPMT Activity to Thiopurine Drug Metabolism

The thiopurines are pro-drugs that require extensive metabolism in order
to exert their cytotoxic action. Azathioprine is nonenzymatically
reduced to 6MP. 6MP and 6TG are activated by HPRT (308000) and
subsequent steps to form cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs) which
are incorporated into DNA and/or RNA, causing DNA-protein cross-links,
single-strand breaks, interstrand cross-links, and sister chromatid
exchange. TPMT functions mainly to inactivate these drugs; thus, a
deficiency of TPMT results in increased conversion to toxic TGNs
(Coulthard and Hogarth, 2005). In addition, 6MP is unique in that it can
also be converted via TPMT into a methyl-thioinosine 5-prime
monophosphate (MeTIMP), a metabolite that inhibits de novo purine
synthesis and likely contributes to the cytotoxic effect of 6MP (Vogt et
al., 1993; Krynetski et al., 1995; Coulthard and Hogarth, 2005).

In an 8-year-old girl with TPMT deficiency (610460) who developed severe
hematopoietic toxicity with conventional oral doses of 6MP for treatment
of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Evans et al., 1991), Krynetski et
al. (1995) identified a mutation in the TPMT gene, referred to as
variant TPMT*2 (A80P; 187680.0001). The mutation was heterozygous in
both the proposita and her mother and absent in the father. The authors
concluded that the patient had a second inactivating mutation. Krynetski
et al. (1995) commented that a reliable method to determine TPMT
genotype is important, given the potentially fatal nature of
hematopoietic toxicity when full doses of mercaptopurine or azathioprine
are given to TPMT-deficient patients.

In 4 individuals with decreased TPMT activity, Szumlanski et al. (1996)
identified homozygosity for a complex TPMT allele, referred to as
TPMT*3A (A154T and Y240C; 187680.0002). TPMT*3A is the most common
mutant TPMT allele among Caucasians (Tai et al., 1996). Tai et al.
(1997) showed that enhanced degradation of TPMT proteins encoded by the
TPMT*2 (187680.0001) and TPMT*3A alleles is the mechanism for lower TPMT
protein and catalytic activity conferred by these mutants.

In a 14-year-old girl who developed severe pancytopenia after starting
AZA for HLA-B27-associated juvenile spondylarthritis (106300), Liepold
et al. (1997) identified homozygosity for the TPMT*3A allele. Family
studies showed that the mother was also homozygous for the deficiency
while other family members were heterozygous. In a patient with
AZA-induced myelosuppression after renal transplant, Kurzawski et al.
(2005) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 variants in the TPMT
gene (TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C; 187680.0005).

Stanulla et al. (2005) stated that 20 TPMT variant alleles,
TPMT*2-TPMT*18, associated with decreased enzyme activity had been
identified. More than 95% of decreased TPMT activity can be explained by
the most frequent mutant alleles TPMT*2 and TPMT*3(A-D).

POPULATION GENETICS

Otterness et al. (1997) described 8 variant alleles for TPMT and their
ethnic differences in frequency.

Among 248 African Americans and 282 Caucasian Americans, Hon et al.
(1999) found that the overall TPMT mutant allele frequencies were
similar, 4.6% and 3.7%, respectively. TPMT*3C was the most prevalent
mutant allele in African Americans (52.2% of mutant alleles), but
represented only 4.8% of mutant alleles in Caucasians. TPMT*3A was the
most prevalent mutant allele in Caucasians (85.7% of mutant alleles),
but represented only 17.4% of mutant alleles in African Americans. Hon
et al. (1999) found a novel allele, designated TPMT*8 (R215H;
187680.0006), in an African American who had intermediate activity.

Ameyaw et al. (1999) identified mutant TPMT alleles in 32 (14.8%) of 217
Ghanaian individuals and 18 (10%) of 199 British Caucasians. All of the
Ghanaian individuals with a mutant allele had TPMT*3C (allele frequency
of 7.6%), whereas only 1 British Caucasian individual had the TPMT*3C
allele (frequency of 0.3%). The other 3 variant alleles were not
detected in any of the Ghanaian samples analyzed. Seventeen of the
British subjects had TPMT*3A (frequency of 4.5%). Phylogenetic analyses
estimate the divergence of Africans and non-Africans to have occurred at
least 100,000 years ago. From gene evolution studies, it is considered
that the most common allele in all populations is usually the ancestral
allele. Mutation and recombination then give rise to the other
genotypes. Ameyaw et al. (1999) concluded that the TPMT*3C mutation may
be the ancestral TPMT mutant allele, as it was present in both Caucasian
and African subjects and had been described in Southwest Asian and
Chinese populations (Collie-Duguid et al., 1999). The TPMT*3B allele was
then acquired and added to form TPMT*3A. Since the TPMT*2 allele appears
to be confined to Caucasians, it may be a more recent allele of this
polymorphic enzyme.

Collie-Duguid et al. (1999) found that the frequency of individuals with
a TPMT variant was 10% (20 of 199) in Caucasians, 2% (2 of 99) in
Southwest Asians, and 4.7% (9 of 192) in Chinese. TPMT*3A was the only
mutant allele found in Southwest Asians (2 heterozygotes) and was the
most common allele in Caucasians (16 heterozygotes and 1 homozygote),
but was not found in Chinese. All mutant alleles in the Chinese were
TPMT*3C (9 heterozygotes). The findings further suggested that TPMT*3C
is the oldest mutation, with TPMT*3B being acquired later to form
TPMT*3A in the Caucasian and Southwest Asian populations.

Using a PCR-SSCP technique to genotype 310 individuals from northern
Portugal. Alves et al. (1999) identified 15 heterozygotes for TPMT*3A;
the corresponding gene frequency estimate was 0.024. Alves et al. (1999)
also identified a silent 474T-C transition (TPMT*1S = 0.215) in this
population.

McLeod et al. (1999) found that the frequency of mutant TPMT alleles was
similar between the Caucasian (10.1%) and Kenyan (10.9%) populations;
however, all mutant alleles in the Kenyan population were TPMT*3C
compared with 4.8% in Caucasians. In contrast, TPMT*3A was the most
common mutant allele in the Caucasian individuals.

Hiratsuka et al. (2000) identified the TPMT*3C allele in 0.8% of 192
Japanese individuals; there were 3 heterozygotes. The TPMT*2, TPMT*3A,
and TPMT*3B alleles were not identified in any of the samples.

Lu et al. (2006) found that the frequency of the TPMT*3C allele was
0.12% and 1.28% in Taiwan aborigines and Taiwanese individuals,
respectively. Other variants, TPMT*2 through TPMT*8, were not
identified.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
THIOPURINE S-METHYLTRANSFERASE DEFICIENCY
TPMT, ALA80PRO

This TPMT variant is referred to as the TPMT*2 allele (Tai et al.,
1996).

In an 8-year-old girl with thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency
(610460) originally reported by Evans et al. (1991), Krynetski et al.
(1995) identified a 238G-C transversion in the TPMT gene, resulting in
an ala80-to-pro (A80P) substitution. The patient developed severe
hematologic toxicity after conventional therapy for acute lymphoblastic
leukemia with oral mercaptopurine. Functional expression studies in a
yeast heterologous expression system showed that the A80P mutant enzyme
had a 100-fold reduction in TPMT catalytic activity compared to the
wildtype enzyme, despite a comparable level of mRNA expression. A
mutation-specific PCR amplification method was developed and used to
detect the same mutation in genomic DNA of the proposita and her mother.
Krynetski et al. (1995) concluded that the patient had a second
inactivating mutation.

Tai et al. (1997) showed that the TPMT*2 and TPMT*3A (187680.0002)
mutant proteins showed enhanced degradation, thus resulting in decreased
TPMT protein and catalytic activity.

Ameyaw et al. (1999) identified the TPMT*2 allele in 2 of 199 British
Caucasian individuals (allele frequency of 0.5%) and none of 217
Ghanaian individuals, suggesting that it is restricted to the Caucasian
population.

TPMT, ALA154THR AND TYR240CYS

This TPMT variant is referred to as TPMT*3A (Tai et al., 1997). See also
TPMT*3B (A154T; 187680.0004) and TPMT*3C (Y240C; 187680.0005).

In 4 individuals with decreased TPMT activity (610460), Szumlanski et
al. (1996) identified homozygosity for 2 mutations in the TPMT gene: a
460G-A transition in exon 7 resulting in an ala154-to-thr (A154T)
substitution, and a 719A-G transition in exon 10 resulting in a
tyr240-to-cys (Y240C) substitution. Three liver samples from individuals
with intermediate TPMT activity were heterozygous for the 2 mutations.
In vitro functional expression studies showed that each mutation
independently, as well as both together, resulted in decreased
expression of TPMT enzymatic activity and immunoreactive protein.

Independently, Tai et al. (1996) identified homozygosity for a mutant
allele carrying the A154T and Y240C substitutions in a TPMT-deficient
patient. Site-directed mutagenesis and heterologous expression
established that either mutation alone resulted in a reduction in
catalytic activity (A154T, 9-fold reduction; Y240C, 1.4-fold reduction),
while the presence of both mutations resulted in complete loss of enzyme
activity.

With mutation-specific PCR-RFLP analysis, Tai et al. (1996) identified
the TPMT*3A mutation in genomic DNA from approximately 75% of unrelated
white subjects with heterozygous TPMT phenotypes, indicating that it is
the most common mutant allele associated with TPMT deficiency.

Tai et al. (1997) showed that the TPMT*2 (187680.0001) and TPMT*3A
mutant proteins showed enhanced degradation, thus resulting in decreased
TPMT protein and catalytic activity.

Ameyaw et al. (1999) identified the TPMT*3A allele in 17 of 199 British
Caucasian individuals (allele frequency of 4.5%) and none of 217
Guanaian individuals.

Hon et al. (1999) identified the TPMT*3A allele in 4 of 248 African
Americans (allele frequency of 0.8%) and 18 of 282 Caucasian Americans
(allele frequency of 3.2%).

Collie-Duguid et al. (1999) found that the TPMT*3A allele was the most
common mutant variant among 199 Caucasian individuals (16 heterozygotes
and 1 homozygote). The mutation was not identified in 192 Chinese
individuals. TPMT*3A was the only mutant allele found in Southwest
Asians (2 heterozygotes in 99 individuals). The findings suggested that
TPMT*3C is the oldest mutation, with TPMT*3B being acquired later to
form TPMT*3A in the Caucasian and Southwest Asian populations.

Liepold et al. (1997) reported a 14-year-old girl who developed severe
pancytopenia 7 weeks after starting azathioprine for HLA-B27-associated
juvenile spondylarthritis (see 106300). She was found to have toxic
levels of 6-thioguanine nucleotides and was TPMT-deficient. Withdrawal
of azathioprine allowed recovery 8 weeks later. Molecular analysis
identified homozygosity for the TPMT*3A allele. Family studies showed
that the mother was also homozygous for the deficiency while other
family members were heterozygous.

In a patient with azathioprine-induced myelosuppression after renal
transplant, Kurzawski et al. (2005) identified compound heterozygosity
for 2 variants in the TPMT gene TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C.

Wang et al. (2005) found that the TPMT*3A protein was ubiquitinated and
formed aggresomes in COS-1 cells. Further analysis indicated that the 2
mutations in TPMT*3A disrupted the protein structure, resulting in
misfolding and aggregation.

.0003
THIOPURINE S-METHYLTRANSFERASE DEFICIENCY
TPMT, IVS9AS, G-A, -1

This TPMT variant is referred to as TPMT*4A (Otterness et al., 1998).

In an individual with thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency
(610460), Otterness et al. (1998) identified compound heterozygosity for
2 mutations in the TPMT gene: TPMT*3A (187680.0002) and a new variant
allele, TPMT*4A, caused by a G-to-A transition that disrupted the
acceptor splice junction at the final 3-prime nucleotide of intron 9.
The new allele was found to cosegregate with reduced TPMT activity
within an extended kindred. The mutation was found to lead to generation
of at least 2 aberrant mRNA species. The first resulted from use of a
novel splice site located 1 nucleotide 3-prime downstream from the
original splice junction. This mRNA species contained a single
nucleotide deletion and a frameshift in exon 10, the terminal exon of
the gene. The second novel mRNA species resulted from activation of a
cryptic splice site located within intron 9, leading to inclusion of 330
nucleotides of intron sequence. That sequence contained a premature
translation termination codon. TPMT*4 was the first reported allele for
low TPMT activity as a result of a mutation within an intron.

.0004
THIOPURINE S-METHYLTRANSFERASE DEFICIENCY
TPMT, ALA154THR

This TPMT variant is referred to as the TPMT*3B allele. Together with
TPMT*3C (Y240C; 187680.0005), it forms TPMT*3A (187680.0002).

The TPMT*3B polymorphic variant allele results from a 460G-A transition
in exon 7 of the TPMT gene, resulting in an ala154-to-thr (A154T)
substitution (Szumlanski et al., 1996)

Ameyaw et al. (1999) did not identify the TPMT*3B allele in 217
Ghanaians or 199 British Caucasians, suggesting that it is a rare
variant.

.0005
THIOPURINE S-METHYLTRANSFERASE DEFICIENCY
TPMT, TYR240CYS

This TPMT variant is referred to as TPMT*3C (Ameyaw et al., 1999).
Together with TPMT*3B (A154T; 187680.0004), it forms TPMT*3A
(187680.0002).

The TPMT*3C polymorphic variant allele results from a 719A-G transition
in exon 10 of the TPMT gene, resulting in a tyr240-to-cys (Y240C)
substitution (Szumlanski et al., 1996)

Ameyaw et al. (1999) identified the Y240C substitution in all 32 of 217
Ghanaian individuals with a mutant TPMT allele (allele frequency of
7.6%), and in only 1 of 199 British Caucasian individual with a mutant
TPMT allele (frequency of 0.3%).

Hon et al. (1999) found that TPMT*3C was the most prevalent mutant
allele among 248 African Americans, accounting for 52.2% of mutant
alleles. The overall frequency of the TPMT*3C allele in this population
was 2.4% compared to 0.17% among 282 Caucasian Americans.

Collie-Duguid et al. (1999) found that the TPMT*3C allele accounted for
all variants among a group of Chinese individuals with mutant alleles.
Nine (4.7%) of 192 individuals were heterozygous, whereas only 1 of 199
Caucasians was heterozygous for the allele. The findings suggested that
TPMT*3C is the oldest mutation, with TPMT*3B being acquired later to
form TPMT*3A.

Hiratsuka et al. (2000) and Lu et al. (2006) identified the TPMT*3C
allele as the only mutant TPMT variant among Japanese and Taiwanese
individuals, respectively.

In a Polish patient with azathioprine-induced myelosuppression after
renal transplant caused by TPMT deficiency (610460), Kurzawski et al.
(2005) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 variants in the TPMT
gene: TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C.

.0006
THIOPURINE S-METHYLTRANSFERASE DEFICIENCY
TPMT, ARG215HIS

This TPMT variant is referred to as TPMT*8.

In an African American with intermediate TPMT activity, Hon et al.
(1999) identified a 644G-A transition in exon 10 of the TPMT gene,
resulting in an arg215-to-his (R215H) substitution,

.0007
THIOPURINE S-METHYLTRANSFERASE DEFICIENCY
TPMT, ALA167GLY

This TPMT variant is referred to as TPMT*23.

In a woman with TPMT deficiency (610460), Lindqvist et al. (2007)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 variant alleles in the TPMT
gene: a 500C-G transversion in exon 8, resulting in an ala167-to-gly
(A167G) substitution, and the common TPMT*3A allele (187680.0002). The
woman's mother and sister had the same genotype; all 3 had extremely low
TPMT activity.

607157	TITLE *607157 SIALIC ACID-BINDING IMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE LECTIN 11; SIGLEC11
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SIGLECs are a family of cell surface lectins defined by shared
structural motifs in the first 2 immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains and by
their ability to recognize sialic acids via the first Ig V set domain.

CLONING

By searching a genomic database for sequences homologous to SIGLECs,
Angata et al. (2002) identified SIGLEC11. They cloned the full-length
cDNA from a fetal liver cDNA library. The deduced 686-amino acid protein
contains 5 extracellular Ig-like domains, a single-pass transmembrane
domain, and a cytosolic tail. SIGLEC11 has conserved arginine and
aromatic amino acids at its N terminus and 3 conserved cysteines in the
first and second Ig-like domains. An aromatic amino acid conserved among
all other SIGLECs within beta strand G is replaced by a histidine in
SIGLEC11. RT-PCR readily detected SIGLEC11 in brain, placenta, lung,
liver, and pancreas, but not in heart, skeletal muscle, or kidney. No
SIGLEC11-positive cells were found by flow cytometry of peripheral blood
leukocytes. Immunohistochemical analysis of human tissue sections
revealed expression in Kupffer cells in liver, intestinal lamina propria
macrophages, brain microglia, perifollicular cells of the spleen, and
intense staining of chronically inflamed tissues. SIGLEC11 stably
expressed in a mouse macrophage cell line could be immunoprecipitated as
a 100-kD band under reducing conditions and as a 180-kD band under
nonreducing conditions, suggesting that it exists in the membrane as a
disulfide-linked dimer.

GENE FUNCTION

Using transient transfection in COS-7 cells, Angata et al. (2002)
detected cell-surface expression of SIGLEC11, but unlike other SIGLECs,
SIGLEC11 failed to show sialic acid-dependent binding of human
erythrocytes. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with several
sialylated oligosaccharides, they found that SIGLEC11 binds weakly but
with strict specificity to alpha-2-8-linked sialic acids, with a
preference toward shorter oligomers. The maximal binding was
significantly weaker than that observed using other SIGLECs. Point
mutation of a conserved arginine in beta strand F of the V set domain
reduced but did not abolish binding. When purified from transfected
mouse macrophages in the presence of a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor,
SIGLEC11 was found to be tyrosine phosphorylated, and when
phosphorylated, SIGLEC11 could be coimmunoprecipitated with SHP1
(176883) and SHP2 (176876).

Hayakawa et al. (2005) analyzed the approximately 3-kb region of
homology between human SIGLEC11 and the pseudogene SIGLECP16 and showed
that an approximately 2-kb segment designated A/A-prime including the
first 5 exons is 99.3% identical. However, the rest of this region,
designated B/B-prime, has a much lower identity (94.6%). A phylogenetic
tree of B/B-prime from the human and chimpanzee genomes shows the
topology expected from the gene orthology. In contrast, the A/A-prime
tree shows a within-species clustering of human SIGLEC11 and human
SIGLECP16, suggesting a recent gene conversion event. Pairwise genetic
distances calculations suggested that although the presumed gene
duplication event yielding ancestral SIGLEC11 and SIGLECP16 predated the
human-chimpanzee common ancestor, the subsequent gene conversion
occurred only in the human lineage. Both human SIGLEC11 and human
SIGLECP16 are more closely related to chimp SIGLECP16 than to chimp
SIGLEC11, and the genetic distance between human SIGLEC11 and chimp
SIGLECP16 is nearly the same as that between SIGLECP16 orthologs. Thus
human SIGLECP16 converted human SIGLEC11. A search of human
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) databases suggested that the
SIGLEC11 sequence is universal to modern humans. The converted region
includes a 5-prime upstream region and exons encoding the Sia
recognition domain. Hayakawa et al. (2005) studied the Sia-binding
properties of recombinant, soluble Siglec11 protein. Chimp Siglec11
showed more robust binding than human SIGLEC11, specifically to
N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), the Sia type missing in humans.
Human SIGLEC11 still bound oligosialic acids, which are enriched in the
brain. Human brain cortex microglia showed strong SIGLEC11 staining in 8
individuals. However, despite positive macrophage staining in other
tissues, microglia showed only occasional staining in 5 chimps and none
in 2 orangutans. Thus, Hayakawa et al. (2005) suggested that brain
microglia gained specific and prominent SIGLEC11 expression in the human
lineage, possibly due to changes of regulatory sequences in the 5-prime
upstream region.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Angata et al. (2002) mapped the SIGLEC11
gene to chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4, about 1 Mb upstream of the SIGLEC3
(159590)-related gene cluster. They also identified a SIGLEC11
pseudogene about 8 kb upstream of the SIGLEC11 gene.

608736	TITLE *608736 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 39 (ZINC TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 14; SLC39A14
;;ZIP14;;
KIAA0062
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc is an essential cofactor for hundreds of enzymes. It is involved in
protein, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, as well as in
the control of gene transcription, growth, development, and
differentiation. SLC39A14 belongs to a subfamily of proteins that show
structural characteristics of zinc transporters (Taylor and Nicholson,
2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated immature myeloid
cell line cDNA library, Nomura et al. (1994) cloned SLC39A14, which they
designated KIAA0062. The deduced 531-amino acid protein contains
possible transmembrane domains. Northern blot analysis detected SLC39A14
expression in all tissues and cell lines examined. Highest expression
was in liver, and lowest expression was in spleen, thymus, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

By searching databases for sequences similar to a unique motif within
LIV-1 (SLC39A6; 608731), Taylor and Nicholson (2003) identified
SLC39A14, which they designated LZT-Hs4. SLC39A14 contains a long N
terminus, followed by 8 putative transmembrane domains and a short C
terminus. It also has a motif similar to the catalytic zinc-binding site
of matrix metalloproteases. Expression of SLC39A14 in Chinese hamster
ovary cells showed an apparent molecular mass of 53 kD and suggested
SLC39A14 has up to 3 N-linked carbohydrate side chains. Under
nonreducing conditions, SLC39A14 migrated as a trimer, consistent with
the formation of an ion channel. SLC39A14 was expressed on the plasma
membrane, colocalized with F-actin, and concentrated on lamellipodiae in
a manner similar to membrane-type matrix metalloproteases.

GENE FUNCTION

Liuzzi et al. (2005) found that Zip14 was the most upregulated zinc
transporter in response to turpentine-induced inflammation or
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mouse liver. Il6 (147620) -/- mice exhibited
neither hypozincemia nor Zip14 induction with turpentine-induced
inflammation, and the hypozincemic response was milder in Il6 -/- mice
exposed to LPS than in wildtype mice. Northern blot analysis revealed
liver-specific upregulation of a single Zip14 transcript.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased expression of Zip14 on the
plasma membrane of hepatocytes in response to both LPS and turpentine.
Il6 also produced increased expression of Zip14 in primary hepatocyte
cultures and localization of the Zip14 protein to the plasma membrane.
Transfection of mouse Zip14 cDNA into human embryonic kidney cells
increased zinc uptake. Liuzzi et al. (2005) concluded that ZIP14 is a
zinc importer upregulated by IL6 that plays a major role in the
hypozincemia accompanying the acute-phase response to inflammation and
infection.

Liuzzi et al. (2006) analyzed the capability of mouse Zip14 to mediate
uptake of non-transferrin (190000)-bound iron following expression in
human and insect cells. Zip14 localized to the plasma membrane, and its
overexpression increased uptake of both radiolabeled zinc and iron. Iron
was taken up as Fe(2+), and uptake was inhibited by zinc. Suppression of
endogenous Zip14 in mouse hepatocytes by small interfering RNA (siRNA)
reduced uptake of both iron and zinc. Zip14 siRNA also decreased
metallothionein (see 156350) mRNA levels, suggesting that compensatory
mechanisms were not sufficient to restore intracellular zinc.

MAPPING

By PCR of a human/rodent hybrid panel, Nomura et al. (1994) mapped the
SLC39A14 gene to chromosome 8.

613574	TITLE *613574 TETRATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 39B; TTC39B
DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the TTC39B gene to chromosome 9p22.3 based on an
alignment of the TTC39B sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK091187) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Teslovich et al. (2010) found that knockdown in mouse liver of the
ortholog Ttc39b via a viral vector resulted in significantly higher
plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Teslovich et al. (2010) performed a genomewide association study of
plasma lipids in more than 100,000 individuals of European ancestry and
reported 95 significantly associated loci (P = less than 5 x 10(-8)),
with 59 showing genomewide significant association with lipid traits for
the first time. The 95 loci contributed not only to normal variation in
lipid traits but also to extreme lipid phenotypes and affected lipid
traits in 3 non-European populations (East Asians, South Asians, and
African Americans). Teslovich et al. (2010) identified dbSNP rs581080, a
SNP in the TTC39B gene on chromosome 9p22, as having an effect on HDL-C
concentrations with an effect size of -0.65 mg per deciliter and a P
value of 3 x 10(-12). In liver, the allele associated with decreased
expression correlated with increased HDL-C.

180246	TITLE *180246 RETINOID X RECEPTOR, BETA; RXRB
DESCRIPTION The retinoic acid receptors, alpha (RARA; 180240), beta (RARB; 180220),
and gamma (RARG; 180190), require coregulators to bind effectively to
response elements and target genes. By a strategy of sequential
screening of expression libraries with a retinoic acid response element
and RAR, Yu et al. (1991) identified a cDNA encoding a coregulator
highly related to RXR-alpha (180245). This protein, termed RXR-beta,
formed heterodimers with RAR, preferentially increasing its DNA binding
and transcriptional activity on promoters containing retinoic acid, but
not thyroid hormone or vitamin D, response elements. Remarkably,
RXR-beta also heterodimerized with thyroid hormone and vitamin D
receptors, increasing both DNA binding and transcriptional function on
their respective response elements. RXR-alpha also formed heterodimers
with these receptors. These observations suggested that retinoid X
receptors meet the criteria for biochemically characterized cellular
coregulators and serve to target selectively the high affinity binding
of retinoic acid, thyroid hormone, and vitamin D receptors to their
cognate DNA response elements.

RARB, RARG, RXRB, and RXRG (180247) are expressed in the striatum. To
study the effect of these genes on locomotion, Kreczel et al. (1998)
developed single and double knockout mice and analyzed their locomotor
skills by open field and rotarod testing. RARB-RXRB, RARB-RXRG, and
RXRB-RXRG double-null mutant mice, but not the corresponding single-null
mutants, exhibited reductions in forward locomotion when compared with
wildtype littermates. Forty percent of the RARB-RXRB-null mutants showed
backward locomotion. Rotarod test performance was impaired for RARB,
RARB-RXRB, RARB-RXRG, and RXRB-RXRG mice. In contrast, RARA, RARG,
RARA-RXRG, and RARG-RXRG-null mice showed no defects in locomotion, even
though both RARA and RARG are also expressed in the striatum. The
morphology, development, and function of skeletal muscle, peripheral
nerves, and spinal cord were normal in all single and double-null
mutants, as were balance reflexes. These results suggested to Kreczel et
al. (1998) that RARB, RXRB, and RXRG are involved specifically in the
control of locomotor behaviors, and that heterodimers of RARB with
either RXRB or RXRG are the functional receptor units, such that RXRB
and RXRG are functionally redundant. Kreczel et al. (1998) studied the
expression of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors (D1R; 126449 and D2R;
126450), the most abundant dopamine receptors in the striatum, in these
mutant mice. RARB-RXRB, RARB-RXRG, and RXRB-RXRG double-null mutants,
but not RARB or RXRG single mutants, exhibited 40% and 30% reduction in
whole-striatal D1R and D2R transcripts, respectively, when compared with
wildtype controls. The reduction was mostly in the medioventral regions
of the striatum, including the shell and core of the nucleus accumbens,
and the mediodorsal part of the caudate putamen. The reduction was not
due to loss of D2R-expressing neurons; no increase in apoptosis was
noted. The histology of the striatum was normal. The characterization of
a retinoic acid response element in the D2R promoter by Samad et al.
(1997) led Kreczel et al. (1998) to suggest that the reduction in D2R
and D2R expression occurs on a transcriptional level. The RARB-RXRB,
RARB-RXRG, and RXRB-RXRG double-null mutants did not exhibit the normal
increase in locomotion induced by cocaine, mimicking the phenotype of
D1R-null mice. Taken together, these results indicated to Kreczel et al.
(1998) that retinoids are involved in controlling the function of the
dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway and suggested that defects in retinoic
acid signaling may contribute to disorders such as Parkinson disease and
schizophrenia.

Using RFLVs in interspecific backcross mice, Hoopes et al. (1992) mapped
the Rxrb gene to the H-2 region of chromosome 17. By homology, it is
likely that the RXRB gene in the human is located on 6p. Fleischhauer et
al. (1993) demonstrated that this is indeed the case. They showed that
the RXRB gene is located in the 6pter-q13 region by Southern
hybridization of genomic DNA from human/rodent cell hybrids with the
mouse gene as a probe. In addition, a full-length cDNA clone encoding a
human RXRB was isolated by nucleic acid screening of a human cDNA
library with a fragment of the mouse gene as a probe. Comparison of
human and murine RXRB showed 97.6% identity on the amino acid level and
91.6% on the nucleotide level. With the relatively crude mapping methods
used, Fleischhauer et al. (1993) could not map RXRB more precisely than
to the short arm of chromosome 6 and/or the proximal part of the long
arm; however, the findings are at least consistent with location in the
HLA region, as suggested by homology. Fitzgibbon et al. (1993) mapped
the RXRB gene to 6p21.3-p21.1 by PCR amplification of 5-prime
untranslated sequence in panels of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids and
to 6p21.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. By pairwise
hybridization of an RXRB cosmid and reference markers in fluorescence in
situ hybridization, Almasan et al. (1994) likewise mapped the RXRB gene
to 6p21.3. Using cosmid clones that cover the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) region, Nagata et al. (1995) determined the precise
physical map positions of the RXRB gene relative to the MHC genes in
mouse and human. Conservation of gene organization was observed between
the 2 species at the HLA-DP (142880) region.

In an elegant series of experiments designed to understand the effect of
RXR activation on cholesterol balance, Repa et al. (2000) treated
animals with the rexinoid LG268. Animals treated with rexinoid exhibited
marked changes in cholesterol balance, including inhibition of
cholesterol absorption and repressed bile acid synthesis. Studies with
receptor-selective agonists revealed that oxysterol receptors (LXRs, see
602423 and 600380) and the bile acid receptor, FXR (603826), are the RXR
heterodimeric partners that mediate these effects by regulating
expression of the reverse-cholesterol transporter, ABC1 (600046), and
the rate-limiting enzyme of bile acid synthesis, CYP7A1 (118455),
respectively. These RXR heterodimers serve as key regulators in
cholesterol homeostasis by governing reverse cholesterol transport from
peripheral tissues, bile acid synthesis in liver, and cholesterol
absorption in intestine. Activation of RXR/LXR heterodimers inhibits
cholesterol absorption by upregulation of ABC1 expression in the small
intestine. Activation of RXR/FXR heterodimers represses CYP7A1
expression and bile acid production, leading to a failure to solubilize
and absorb cholesterol. Studies have shown that RXR/FXR-mediated
repression of CYP7A1 is dominant over RXR/LXR-mediated induction of
CYP7A1, which explains why the rexinoid represses rather than activates
CYP7A1 (Lu et al., 2000). Activation of the LXR signaling pathway
results in the upregulation of ABC1 in peripheral cells, including
macrophages, to efflux free cholesterol for transport back to the liver
through high density lipoprotein, where it is converted to bile acids by
the LXR-mediated increase in CYP7A1 expression. Secretion of biliary
cholesterol in the presence of increased bile acid pools normally
results in enhanced reabsorption of cholesterol; however, with the
increased expression of ABC1 and efflux of cholesterol back into the
lumen, there is a reduction in cholesterol absorption and net excretion
of cholesterol and bile acid. Rexinoids therefore offer a novel class of
agents for treating elevated cholesterol.

603706	TITLE *603706 SEMAPHORIN 4F; SEMA4F
;;SEMAPHORIN W; SEMAW;;
SEMAPHORIN M; SEMAM
DESCRIPTION The semaphorins comprise a large family of membrane-bound and secreted
proteins, some of which have been shown to function in axon guidance.
See semaphorin 3F (601124). Encinas et al. (1999) cloned a novel
semaphorin, which they referred to as semaphorin W (SEMAW). Sequence
analysis of the SEMAW gene indicated that SEMAW is a member of the class
IV subgroup of transmembrane semaphorins. The mouse and rat forms of
semaphorin W share 97% amino acid sequence identity, and each shows
approximately 91% identity with the human form. The SEMAW gene contains
15 exons, up to 4 of which were absent in the human cDNAs sequenced by
Encinas et al. (1999). Expression studies showed that SEMAW mRNA is
expressed at high levels in postnatal brain and lung and, unlike many
other semaphorins, at low levels in the developing embryo. Functional
studies showed that semaphorin W can collapse retinal ganglion cell
axons.

By genetic mapping with human/hamster radiation hybrids, Encinas et al.
(1999) mapped the human SEMAW gene to chromosome 2p13. By genetic
mapping with mouse/hamster radiation hybrids, they mapped the mouse
Semaw gene to chromosome 6; physical mapping placed the gene on BACs
carrying microsatellite markers D6Mit70 and D6Mit189. This localization
placed the mouse Semaw gene within the locus for motor neuron
degeneration-2 of mouse, making it an attractive candidate for that
disorder.

615302	TITLE *615302 ADENOSINE DEAMINASE, tRNA-SPECIFIC, 3; ADAT3
;;TAD3, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; TAD3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ADAT3 belongs to a family of enzymes that form inosine by hydrolytic
deamination of genomically encoded adenosine on tRNAs (Gerber and
Keller, 1999). Inosine occurs at the wobble position of tRNA anticodons
and can translate codons ending in uracil, cytosine, or adenine.

CLONING

Gerber and Keller (1999) cloned S. Cerevisiae Tad3. The deduced
322-amino acid protein contains a central nuclear localization signal
followed by a deaminase domain with 3 conserved residues (histidine and
2 cytosines) involved in zinc coordination, and a proline in the
deaminase motif II that is expected to bind the ammonium group of
adenosine.

GENE FUNCTION

Gerber and Keller (1999) found that both Tad3 and Tad2 (ADAT2; 615388)
were required for viability in yeast. Tad3 and Tad2 formed a
heterodimer, which was required for conversion of adenosine-34 to
inosine-34 in synthetic tRNA(ala). Tad2 appeared to be the catalytic
subunit of the deaminase.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the ADAT3 gene to chromosome 19p13.3 based on an
alignment of the ADAT3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC011824) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 8 consanguineous Arab families with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-36 (MRT36; 615286), Alazami et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous mutation in the ADAT3 gene (V128M; 615302.0001).
Molecular modeling indicated that the mutation occurs in a hook that
protrudes from the surface of the protein and would disrupt this
protrusion. The mutation, which was found by homozygosity mapping and
exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, segregated with the
disorder in all families and was not found in several large control
exome databases or in 580 ethnically matched alleles. Haplotype analysis
indicated a founder effect, which was estimated to have occurred between
65 and 111 generations ago.

606696	TITLE *606696 KATANIN, p60 SUBUNIT, A1; KATNA1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Microtubules are dynamic polymers of alpha-tubulin (e.g., TUBA3; 602529)
and beta-tubulin (TUBB; 191130) that are used to organize membranous
organelles during interphase and to segregate chromosomes during
mitosis. Microtubule-severing proteins generate internal breaks within
microtubules during metaphase but not during interphase. Katanin is an
ATP-dependent microtubule-severing protein composed of p60 and p80
subunits. Katanin p80 (KATNB1; 602703) is concentrated at centrosomes
during interphase.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologs of sea urchin p60 katanin,
followed by 3-prime RACE with fibroblast cDNA, McNally and Thomas (1998)
isolated a cDNA encoding KATNA1. Sequence analysis predicted that the
491-amino acid KATNA1 protein contains a central consensus cyclin B
(CCNB1; 123836)/CDC2 (116940) phosphorylation site (TPLK). The
N-terminal 80 residues of KATNA1 and sea urchin p60 katanin are 50%
identical, and the C-terminal 318-residue AAA (for 'ATPase associated
with a variety of cellular activities') ATPase domain of KATNA1 and sea
urchin p60 katanin are 75% identical. Immunoblot analysis revealed wide
expression of a 55- to 60-kD protein that was coexpressed with p80
katanin in frog eggs. Anti-KATNA1 antibody inhibited
microtubule-severing activity in Xenopus eggs. Immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated diffuse expression and focal colocalization with
gamma-tubulin (TUBG; 191135) in interphase fibroblast microtubule
asters, as is also seen with KATNB1. McNally and Thomas (1998) observed
that the area occupied by KATNA1 is twice that occupied by TUBG during
metaphase. McNally and Thomas (1998) proposed that CCNB1/CDC2 activates
KATNA1 microtubule-severing activity near centrosomes during mitosis.

Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis, Karabay et
al. (2004) showed that Katna1 localizes along the length of axons at
early stages of neuronal development in the rat and mouse, with
expression generally higher in and near growth cones of extending axons
and in distal regions. Katna1 expression declined upon neuronal
maturation.

GENE FUNCTION

Toyo-Oka et al. (2005) identified KATNA1 as a molecular target of NDEL1
(607538). Phosphorylation of Ndel1 by Cdk5 (123831) facilitated
interaction between NDEL1 and KATNA1, suggesting that phosphorylated
NDEL1 may regulate the distribution of KATNA1. Abnormal accumulation of
Katna1 in the nucleus of Ndel1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts
supported an essential role for NDEL1 in KATNA1 regulation. Complete
loss of Ndel1 or expression of dominant-negative Katna1 mutants in
migrating neurons resulted in defective migration and elongation of
nuclear-centrosomal distance. Toyo-Oka et al. (2005) suggested that
NDEL1 may be essential for mitotic cell division and neuronal migration,
not only via regulation of cytoplasmic dynein function, but also by
modulation of KATNA1 localization and function.

Postmitotic neurons require microtubules for dynamic scaffolding within
axons, dendrites, and growth cones. Microtubules are nucleated
exclusively at centrosomes and must be severed from the centrosome for
transport into the axon; shorter microtubules are transported along
axons more quickly than long microtubules. Using overexpression and
knockdown studies with cultured rodent neurons, Karabay et al. (2004)
showed that Katna1 is an active microtubule-severing enzyme with a
critical role in neuronal microtubule dynamics. Katna1 expression
dropped when axons were presented with target cells that caused them to
stop growing.

Iwaya et al. (2010) showed that the N-terminal microtubule interacting
and trafficking (MIT) domains of mouse and human KATNA1 bound
unpolymerized, but not polymerized, tubulin. The isolated MIT domain of
KATNA1 formed an antiparallel 3-stranded helix, with a hydrophobic core
of partly conserved alanine residues. Mutagenesis experiments revealed
that positively charged arg49 and lys67 of helix 3 are required for
tubulin binding. A coiled-coil region that follows the MIT domain
mediates dimer formation and when included in the protein fragment
interfered with binding of the MIT domain to tubulin.

Using cDNA constructs based on mouse p60 and p80 (602703), Iwaya et al.
(2012) showed that the N-terminal MIT domain of p60 interacted with the
C-terminal domain (CTD) of p80. Binding of either microtubules or the
p80-CTD to the p60 MIT domain stimulated the ATPase and
microtubule-severing activity of p60. Ca(2+) bound to a separate region
of the MIT domain of p60 and negatively regulated microtubule- or
p80-enhanced p60 activity. Ca(2+) did not inhibit the basal ATPase
activity of p60 or the binding of p60 to microtubules.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the KATNA1
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP EST392905).

Hartz (2012) mapped the KATNA1 gene to chromosome 6q25.1 based on the
alignment of the KATNA1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF056022) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

606398	TITLE *606398 ACTIVATING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 5; ATF5
;;ATFX
DESCRIPTION Activating transcription factors (ATFs), or cAMP response
element-binding proteins (CREBs), bind to cAMP-inducible promoters and
are involved in gene transcription.

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with CDC34 (116948) as the bait, Pati et
al. (1999) obtained a partial cDNA encoding ATF5. The deduced 122-amino
acid protein contains a C-terminal bZIP motif with only 3 leucines
instead of the conventional 5; the 2 distal leucines are replaced by
valines. Functional analysis showed that ATF5 is degraded by ubiquitin
proteasome machinery in a CDC34- and RAD6B (UBE2B; 179095)-dependent
pathway.

By yeast 2-hybrid screening with the GABA-B receptor (GABBR1; 603540) as
the bait, White et al. (2000) isolated a full-length cDNA encoding ATF5,
which they termed ATFX. Sequence analysis predicted that the 282-amino
acid protein, which is 57% identical to CREB2 (ATF2; 123811) in the bZIP
domain, contains 2 N-terminal consensus MAP kinase phosphorylation
sites. Mutation analysis showed that the GABBR1-ATF5 interaction occurs
between the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of GABBR1 and the bZIP domain
of ATF5.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with PRL1 (PTP4A1; 601585) as the bait,
Peters et al. (2001) identified a cDNA encoding ATF5, which they termed
ATF7. EMSA analysis indicated that ATF5 binds to CRE but not C/EBP
oligonucleotides. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression
of ATF5, with highest levels in liver, lung, adipose tissue, heart, and
skeletal muscle. Coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down analyses
confirmed the association of the C-terminal bZIP motif of ATF5 with the
PTPase domain and adjacent residues of PRL1 in vitro. SDS-PAGE analysis
showed that PRL1 dephosphorylates ATF5.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ATF5
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP stSG54779).

GENE FUNCTION

Sheng et al. (2010) used a genomewide RNAi screen in mouse glioma
(137800) cells to identify activators of the trancription factor ATF5,
which is highly expressed in glioma cells. The results indicated that
FRS2 (607743), PAK1 (602590), and CREB3L2 (608834) are components of
RAS-MAPK- or PI3K-activated pathways that regulate ATF5 expression, and
that this pathway is required for viability of malignant glioma cells.
Further studies indicated that ATF5 promoted survival through
upregulation of MCL1 (159552), an antiapoptotic factor. The ATF5 pathway
was also found to promote survival in other human cancer cell lines.
Analysis of human malignant glioma samples indicated that ATF5
expression inversely correlated with disease prognosis. The RAF kinase
inhibitor sorafenib suppressed ATF5 expression in glioma stem cells and
inhibited malignant glioma growth in human cell culture and mouse
models. The findings demonstrated that ATF5 is essential in genesis of
malignant glioma.

;;FRIZZLED 5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Wang et al. (1996) cloned and sequenced a large family of mammalian
homologs of the Drosophila polarity gene 'frizzled' (see 600667). One of
these was a human gene, termed 'frizzled 5,' isolated from a retina cDNA
library. Wang et al. (1996) determined that this gene encodes a
polypeptide of 585 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

He et al. (1997) showed that human frizzled 5 is the receptor for the
Wnt5A (164975) ligand.

MAPPING

Wang et al. (1996) used interspecific backcross analysis to map the gene
to mouse chromosome 1 between the markers Ctla4 (123890) and Fn1
(135600), which is syntenic to human chromosome 2q33-q34.

118661	TITLE *118661 VERSICAN; VCAN
;;CHONDROITIN SULFATE PROTEOGLYCAN 2; CSPG2;;
CHONDROITIN SULFATE PROTEOGLYCAN CORE PROTEIN, CARTILAGE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans were first identified in hyaline
cartilage, where they specifically interact with hyaluronan and form
large supramolecular complexes. Together with other matrix
glycoproteins, they provide mechanical support and a fixed negative
charge. Such molecules exist also in a variety of soft tissues where
they may play additional physiologic roles (Kjellen and Lindahl, 1991).

CLONING

Zimmermann and Ruoslahti (1989) cloned and sequenced the cDNA of the
core protein of fibroblast chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. They
designated it versican in recognition of its versatile modular
structure. Decorin (125255) and biglycan (301870) are 2 other soft
tissue proteoglycans.

Naso et al. (1995) reported that the mouse versican protein is 89%
identical to human versican and is highly expressed in mouse embryos at
days 13, 14, and 18.

Dours-Zimmermann and Zimmermann (1994) provided evidence for the
existence of 3 versican splice variants, designated V0, V1, and V2,
which differ in the length of their glycosaminoglycan attachment portion
inserted between the globular modules at the N- and C-terminal ends of
the core proteins. Versican V1 and V2 include either the GAG-alpha or
the GAG-beta domain providing attachment sites for about 5 to 8 or 12 to
15 glycosaminoglycan chains, respectively. In the V0 variant, both
GAG-alpha and GAG-beta are present. Zako et al. (1995) demonstrated the
existence of another splice variant, designated V3, which lacks a
chondroitin sulfate attachment region, the most distinctive portion of a
proteoglycan molecule.

Bode-Lesniewska et al. (1996) studied the distribution of versican by
using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies that recognize the core
protein of the prominent versican splice variants V0 and V1. Versican
was present in the loose connective tissues of various organs and was
often associated with the elastic fiber network. It was localized in
most smooth muscle tissues and in fibrous and elastic cartilage.
Versican staining was noted in the central and peripheral nervous
system, in the basal layer of the epidermis, and on the luminal surface
of some glandular epithelia. In blood vessels, versican was present in
all 3 wall layers of veins and elastic arteries. In muscular arteries
the immunoreactivity was normally restricted to the tunica adventitia.
However, it appeared in the media and the split elastica interna of
atherosclerotically transformed vessel walls.

GENE STRUCTURE

Naso et al. (1994) showed that the human versican gene contains 15 exons
spanning more than 90 kb. One of these, exon 7, is used in an
alternative splice variant. The authors sequenced the 5-prime
promoter-containing region of the gene and found that it contained
numerous binding sites for transactivators such as AP2 (107580) and Sp1
(189906). They used transient transfection studies to show that the
promoter functioned well in both mesenchymal and epithelial cells. The
authors used deletion studies to show that this 5-prime region (to
approximately -630) contains both strong enhancer and strong negative
regulatory elements.

MAPPING

The distinctness of CSPG1 (AGC1; 155760) and CSPG2 was uncertain until
both genes had been mapped. Whereas CSPG1 is located on chromosome 15,
Iozzo et al. (1992) demonstrated that the CSPG2 gene is located on
chromosome 5. They used a combination of human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids including a panel of hybrids containing partial deletions of
chromosome 5 and narrowed the assignment to 5q12-q14, with the precise
site likely to be 5q13.2, by in situ hybridization.

Using interspecific backcross analysis, Naso et al. (1995) assigned the
Cspg2 gene to mouse chromosome 13 in a region that is syntenic with 5q.

GENE FUNCTION

To determine whether TP53 (191170) gene dosage affects transcriptional
regulation of target genes, Yoon et al. (2002) performed oligonucleotide
array gene expression analysis by using human cells with wildtype p53 or
with 1 or both TP53 alleles disrupted by homologous recombination. They
identified 35 genes, including CSPG2, whose expression was significantly
correlated to the dosage of TP53. Motif search analysis revealed that
CSPG2 contains a p53 consensus binding site in its first intron. In
vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that CSPG2 is directly
transactivated by p53.

To understand how cancer cells infect the inflammatory microenvironment,
Kim et al. (2009) conducted a biochemical screen for
macrophage-activating factors secreted by metastatic carcinomas. They
demonstrated that, among the cell lines screened, Lewis lung carcinoma
(LLC) were the most potent macrophage activators leading to production
of interleukin-6 (IL6; 147620) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-alpha; 119160) through activation of the Toll-like receptor family
members TLR2 (603028) and TLR6 (605403). Both TNF-alpha and TLR2 were
found to be required for LLC metastasis. Biochemical purification of
LLC-conditioned medium led to identification of the extracellular matrix
proteoglycan versican, which is upregulated in many human tumors
including lung cancer, as a macrophage activator that acts through TLR2
and its coreceptors TLR6 and CD14 (158120). By activating TLR2:TLR6
complexes and inducing TNF-alpha secretion by myeloid cells, versican
strongly enhances LLC metastatic growth. Kim et al. (2009) concluded
that their results explained how advanced cancer cells usurp components
of the host innate immune system, including bone marrow-derived myeloid
progenitors, to generate an inflammatory microenvironment hospitable for
metastatic growth.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wagner vitreoretinopathy (WGVRP; 143200) is an autosomal dominant
vitreoretinopathy. Miyamoto et al. (2005) demonstrated a heterozygous
A-to-G transversion at the second base of the 3-prime acceptor splice
site of intron 7 of the CSPG2 gene that cosegregated with the disease in
a Japanese family (118661.0001).

In the large 5-generation Swiss family with vitreoretinopathy originally
described by Wagner (1938), Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2006) identified
a heterozygous splice site mutation in intron 8 of the VCAN gene
(118661.0002) that segregated fully with disease.

In affected members of 7 Dutch families with vitreoretinopathy,
Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for 3 splice site
mutations in intron 7 of the VCAN gene (118661.0003-118661.0005).
Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient blood samples revealed a highly
significant (p less than 0.0001) and consistent increase in the V2 and
V3 splice variants (more than 38-fold and more than 12-fold,
respectively) in all patients with intron 7 nucleotide changes, as well
as in a Chinese family with vitreoretinopathy in which a causal variant
was not identified. Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) suggested that Wagner
vitreoretinopathy is caused by an imbalance of versican isoforms,
mediated by intronic variants.

In a 4-generation French family with a severe vitreoretinal disorder
mapping to 5q13-q14, Brezin et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous
splice site mutation in intron 7 of the VCAN gene (118661.0006) that
segregated with disease and was not found 100 French controls.

In a British family and a French family with Wagner vitreoretinopathy,
Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) sequenced the VCAN gene and identified
2 heterozygous splice site mutations, in intron 8 and intron 7 of the
VCAN gene, respectively, that segregated with disease in each family
(118661.0007 and 118661.0008). The levels of splice variants V2 and V3
were significantly increased in all patient fibroblast and blood samples
from these families as well as samples from the Swiss family with
vitreoretinopathy originally described by Wagner (1938), although the
magnitude of the increase varied between tissues and mutations. There
were no statistically significant differences in V0 and V1 levels in
fibroblasts or blood between patients and controls.

In a Japanese family with Wagner syndrome (143200) in which members of 4
generations, to a total of 13 with 11 living at the time of study, were
affected, Miyamoto et al. (2005) described a heterozygous splice
acceptor site mutation in the CSPG2 gene: 4004-2 A-G. Results of RT-PCR
analysis indicated that the mutation activated a cryptic splice site
located 39 bp downstream from the authentic 3-prime splice acceptor
site.

In a large 5-generation Swiss family with vitreoretinopathy (143200),
originally described by Wagner (1938), Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous transition (9265+1G-A) at the highly conserved
splice donor sequence in intron 8 of the VCAN gene, which segregated
with the phenotype in 21 affected and 26 unaffected family members and
was not found in 104 control alleles. RT-PCR analysis using patient RNA
from venous blood revealed 2 aberrant CSPG2 transcripts, 1 lacking the
entire exon 8 and the other missing only the last 21 bp of exon 8.

Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) analyzed fibroblasts from a member of
the Swiss family with vitreoretinopathy originally described by Wagner
(1938) and found a 700-fold and a 150-fold increase in versican isoforms
V2 and V3, respectively, compared to controls. In patient blood samples,
amounts of V2 and V3 were increased 48-fold and 32-fold, respectively.

In all affected individuals from 5 Dutch families with vitreoretinopathy
(143200), including 4 families diagnosed with Wagner syndrome and 1 with
erosive vitreoretinopathy, Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) identified
heterozygosity for a transition in intron 7 (4004-5T-C) of the VCAN
gene. The mutation was not found in unaffected individuals from any of
the 5 families, or in 250 Dutch controls. The 5 families shared a common
haplotype on chromosome 5q14, suggesting a founder mutation.
Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient blood samples revealed a highly
significant (p less than 0.0001) and consistent increase in the V2 and
V3 splice variants (more than 38-fold and more than 12-fold,
respectively) compared to controls.

not found in unaffected members of the family, or in 250 Dutch controls.
RT-PCR analysis of mutant versican transcripts showed activation of a
cryptic splice site resulting in a 39-nucleotide in-frame deletion of
exon 8 in splice variant V0. Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient
blood samples revealed a highly significant (p less than 0.0001) and
consistent increase in the V2 and V3 splice variants (more than 45-fold
and more than 13-fold, respectively) compared to controls.

transition in intron 7 (4004-1G-A) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was
not found in unaffected members of the family, or in 250 Dutch controls.
RT-PCR analysis of mutant versican transcripts showed activation of a
cryptic splice site resulting in a 39-nucleotide in-frame deletion of
exon 8 in splice variant V0. Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient
blood samples revealed a highly significant (p less than 0.0001) and
consistent increase in the V2 and V3 splice variants (more than 137-fold
and more than 22-fold, respectively) compared to controls.

VCAN, IVS7AS, A-T, -2

In 10 affected members of a 4-generation French family with severe
vitreoretinopathy (1432300), Brezin et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a transversion within the highly conserved acceptor
splice site of intron 7 (4004-2A-T) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was
not found in 6 unaffected family members or in 100 French controls.
Patients in this kindred had a highly variable phenotype, including
exudative vascular abnormalities, and exhibited severe visual
impairment. RT-PCR analysis of patient lymphoblastoid cell RNA indicated
that the mutation activates a cryptic acceptor splice site within exon
8, located 39 bp downstream from the authentic 3-prime splice acceptor
site. Direct sequencing of a shortened RNA fragment showed loss of the
first 39 bp of exon 8, predicted to cause in-frame deletion of 13 amino
acid residues from the beginning of the GAG-beta domain of mature
versican. RT-PCR also indicated aberrant expression of a versican mRNA
lacking the entire exon 8.

Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a
transition within the conserved splice donor site of intron 8
(9265+2T-A) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was not found in 300 control

Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a
transversion within the conserved splice acceptor site of intron 7
(4004-1G-C) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was not found in 19
unaffected family members or in 300 control alleles. In patient
fibroblasts, there was an 80-fold and a 150-fold increase in versican
isoforms V2 and V3, respectively, compared to controls, whereas in
patient blood samples, amounts of V2 and V3 increased 64-fold and
6-fold, respectively.
