MIRN98
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIR98, are endogenous noncoding RNAs of
about 22 nucleotides that bind complementary sequences within the
3-prime UTRs of target mRNAs, leading to translational repression and/or
mRNA cleavage (Hu et al., 2009).

CLONING

Mourelatos et al. (2002) identified MIR98 as 1 of at least 40 miRNAs
present in a large 15S RNP complex containing EIF2C2 (606229), GEMIN3
(606168), and GEMIN4 (606969). The MIR98 sequence is
UGAGGUAGUAAGUUGUAUUGUU.

GENE FUNCTION

Hu et al. (2009) noted that miRNAs have been implicated in the fine
tuning of the Toll-like receptor (TLR; see 603030)-mediated inflammatory
response. Using Northern and Western blot analyses and PCR with human
cholangiocytes, which express multiple TLRs, Hu et al. (2009) showed
that MIR98 and LET7 (see MIRNLET7A1; 605386) regulated CIS (CISH;
602441) protein expression via translational suppression. CIS expression
was upregulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Cryptosporidium parvum
exposure, and this upregulation involved downregulation of MIR98 and
LET7, which relieved MIR98- and LET7-mediated translational repression
of CIS. Gain- and loss-of-function studies showed that CIS accelerated
degradation of IKBA (NFKBIA; 164008) and enhanced NFKB (see 164011)
activation in cholangiocytes in response to LPS stimulation or C. parvum
exposure.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Mourelatos et al. (2002) mapped the MIR98
gene to chromosome X.

602352	TITLE *602352 GONADOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE 2; GNRH2
DESCRIPTION Gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GNRH1; 152760) is a decapeptide widely
known for its role in regulating reproduction by serving as a signal
from the hypothalamus to pituitary gonadotropes. This function for GNRH1
has been highly conserved during 500 million years of vertebrate
evolution despite the fact that its amino acid sequence varies by 50%.
In addition to the hypothalamic GNRH1 of variable sequence, many
vertebrate species express a second, invariant GNRH form, GNRH-II (or
GNRH2), with the primary structure
gln-his-trp-ser-his-gly-trp-tyr-pro-gly. Antibody staining demonstrates
GNRH2 in the midbrain of all species where its location has been
described (Kasten et al., 1996). Furthermore, nucleic acid probes have
been used to identify GNRH2 expression in the midbrain of several fish
species and one mammal. White et al. (1998) showed that a gene encoding
GNRH2 is expressed in humans and is located on chromosome 20p13,
distinct from the GNRH1 gene on 8p21-p11.2. The genomic and mRNA
structures of GNRH2 parallel those of GNRH1. However, in contrast to
GNRH1, GNRH2 is expressed at significantly higher levels outside the
brain (up to 30-fold), particularly in the kidney, bone marrow, and
prostate. The widespread expression of GNRH2 suggests it may have
multiple functions. Molecular phylogenetic analysis shows that GNRH2 is
likely the result of a duplication before the appearance of vertebrates,
and predicts the existence of a third GNRH form in humans and other
vertebrates. White et al. (1998) used fluorescence in situ hybridization
to map GNRH2 to 20p13.

Chen et al. (2002) found that human normal and leukemic T cells produce
GNRH2 and GNRH1. Exposure of normal or cancerous human or mouse T cells
to GNRH2 or GNRH1 triggered de novo gene transcription and cell-surface
expression of the laminin receptor (150370), which is involved in
cellular adhesion and migration and in tumor invasion and metastasis.
GNRH2 or GNRH1 also induced adhesion to laminin and chemotaxis toward
SDF1A (600835), and augmented entry in vivo of metastatic T-lymphoma
into the spleen and bone marrow. Homing of normal T cells into specific
organs was reduced in mice lacking GNRH1. A specific GNRH1 receptor
antagonist blocked GNRH1 but not GNRH2-induced effects, which was
suggestive of signaling through distinct receptors. Chen et al. (2002)
suggested that GNRH2 and GNRH1, secreted from nerves or autocrine or
paracrine sources, interact directly with T cells and trigger gene
transcription, adhesion, chemotaxis, and homing to specific organs.

604065	TITLE *604065 CALCIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT, T TYPE, ALPHA-1G SUBUNIT; CACNA1G
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Voltage-activated calcium channels can be distinguished based on their
voltage-dependence, deactivation, and single-channel conductance. See
601011. Low-voltage-activated calcium channels are referred to as 'T'
type because their currents are both transient, owing to fast
inactivation, and tiny, owing to small conductance. T-type channels are
thought to be involved in pacemaker activity, low-threshold calcium
spikes, neuronal oscillations and resonance, and rebound burst firing.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences related to calcium channels,
Perez-Reyes et al. (1998) identified a partial human cDNA encoding a
novel channel that they designated alpha-1G or Ca(V)T.1. The authors
used the partial cDNA to isolate additional human, rat, and mouse
alpha-1G cDNAs. Northern blot analysis of human and rat tissues
indicated that the alpha-1G gene was expressed as an 8.5-kb mRNA
predominantly in brain. An additional 9.7-kb transcript was also
detected. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the rat alpha-1G channel
exhibited the properties of a low-voltage-activated T-type calcium
channel.

Jagannathan et al. (2002) found that multiple isoforms of CACNA1G and at
least 2 isoforms of CACNA1H (607904) are generated by alternative
splicing and are expressed in testis. In situ hybridization localized
transcripts both in germ cells and in other testis cell types. Within
cardiac tissue, both CACNA1G and CACNA1H were expressed in vascular
tissue and not in myocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

By whole-cell patch clamp, Jagannathan et al. (2002) detected T-type
voltage-operated Ca(2+) channel currents in isolated round spermatids.
Currents were consistent with those generated by CACNA1H or CACNA1G
channels.

By action potential clamp studies, Chemin et al. (2002) found
significant differences in the biochemical properties of CACNA1G,
CACNA1H, and CACNA1I (608230) following transient transfection in human
embryonic kidney cells. Using firing activities recorded in dissociated
rat cerebellar Purkinje neurons and thalamocortical relay neurons as
voltage-clamp waveforms, they showed that CACNA1I currents contributed
to sustained electrical activities, while CACNA1G and CACNA1H currents
generated short burst firing. Chemin et al. (2002) hypothesized that
each of the T-channel pore-forming subunits displays specific gating
properties that uniquely contribute to neuronal firing and that CACNA1I
channels provide pacemaker activity.

MAPPING

By FISH and radiation hybrid analysis, Perez-Reyes et al. (1998) mapped
the CACNA1G gene to 17q22. Using interspecific backcross analysis, they
mapped the mouse Cacna1g gene to the distal portion of chromosome 11, in
a region showing homology of synteny with 17q22.

ANIMAL MODEL

To investigate whether T-type Ca(2+) channels in thalamocortical relay
(TC) neurons are involved in the generation of spike-and-wave discharges
(SWDs), Kim et al. (2001) used gene targeting to generate a null
mutation of CACNA1G that encodes the pore-forming subunit of T-type
Ca(2+) channels. The knockout mice grew normally and were fertile.
General development of the brain and major organs appeared normal. Using
pharmacologic models, Kim et al. (2001) analyzed the ability of mutant
mice to generate SWDs. The thalamocortical relay neurons of the knockout
mice lacked the burst mode firing of action potentials, whereas they
showed the normal pattern of tonic mode firing. The knockout thalamus
was specifically resistant to the generation of SWDs in response to
GABA-B receptor (see 603540) activation. Kim et al. (2001) concluded
that the modulation of the intrinsic firing pattern mediated by CACNA1G
T-type Ca(2+) channels plays a critical role in the generation of GABA-B
receptor-mediated SWDs in the thalamocortical pathway, the hallmark of
absence seizures.

Sensations from viscera, like fullness, easily become painful if the
stimulus persists. Kim et al. (2003) demonstrated that mice lacking
alpha 1G T-type calcium channels show hyperalgesia to visceral pain.
Thalamic infusion of a T-type blocker induced similar hyperalgesia in
wildtype mice. In response to visceral pain, the ventroposterolateral
thalamic neurons evoked a surge of single spikes, which then slowly
decayed as T type-dependent burst spikes gradually increased. In
alpha-1G-deficient neurons, the single-spike response persisted without
burst spikes. Kim et al. (2003) concluded that T-type calcium channels
underlie an antinociceptive mechanism operating in the thalamus and that
their findings support the idea that burst firing plays a critical role
in sensory gating in the thalamus.

MIRN181B2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIR181B, are short noncoding RNAs that
repress translation or induce cleavage of target mRNAs with which they
interact (Ciafre et al., 2005). Two distinct genes, MIR181B1 (612744)
and MIR181B2, encode the same mature MIR181B miRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Using microarray and Northern blot analyses, Ciafre et al. (2005) found
that expression of MIR181B was significantly downregulated in primary
glioblastomas and human glioblastoma cell lines compared with normal
brain tissue.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the MIR181B2 gene to chromosome 9q33.3 based on an
alignment of the MIR181B2 stem-loop sequence
(CUGAUGGCUGCACUCAACAUUCAUUGCUGUCGGUGGGUUUGAGUCUGAAUCAACUCACUGAUCAAUGAAUG
CAAACUGCGGACCAAACA) with the genomic sequence (build 36.1).

604450	TITLE *604450 PROTEASOME 26S SUBUNIT, NON-ATPase, 12; PSMD12
;;p55
DESCRIPTION The 26S proteasome is responsible for the ATP-dependent degradation of a
variety of cellular proteins. Selective breakdown of these proteins is
mediated by the ubiquitin pathway. The 26S proteasome is a 2,000-kD
protein complex composed of the 20S proteasome, which is the catalytic
subcomplex, and PA700, which is the regulatory subcomplex. The
approximately 700-kD PA700 complex consists of approximately 20
heterogeneous proteins ranging from 25 to 112 kD. These subunits can be
divided into 2 classes, those that are members of the AAA (ATPases
associated with various cellular activities) family and those that are
not.

Saito et al. (1997) sequenced peptides from the p55 subunit of the
bovine PA700 complex. They identified a human EST encoding a homologous
protein and used this EST to isolate hepatoblastoma HepG2 cell cDNAs
encoding human p55, also called PSMD12. The deduced 456-amino acid
PSMD12 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 52,903 Da. The authors
identified a putative S. cerevisiae homolog, which they named NAS5, that
shares 41.1% amino acid sequence identity with PSMD12. Disruption of the
NAS5 gene resulted in lethality.

608513	TITLE *608513 RIBONUCLEASE P, RNA COMPONENT H1; RPPH1
;;H1 RNA; H1RNA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

H1RNA is the RNA component of the RNase P ribonucleoprotein, an
endoribonuclease that cleaves tRNA precursor molecules to form the
mature 5-prime termini of their tRNA sequences (Baer et al., 1989).

CLONING

Bartkiewicz et al. (1989) purified RNase P from HeLa cell extracts and,
using this as template, synthesized and cloned H1RNA cDNA. The deduced
340-nucleotide transcript does not contain a 5-prime cap structure. The
5-prime and 3-prime termini are complementary, and the authors predicted
that they are hydrogen bonded.

Baer et al. (1989) cloned an H1RNA cDNA, including its flanking regions,
from human spleen DNA. In vitro transcription of H1RNA cDNA using S100
and whole HeLa cell extracts confirmed synthesis of a transcript
containing about 340 nucleotides. The mature form of H1RNA did not
appear to be derived from a larger precursor molecule. Inhibitor studies
indicated that H1RNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase (Pol) III (see
606007).

GENE FUNCTION

Following depletion of RNase P from HeLa cell extracts, Reiner et al.
(2006) found a severe deficiency in Pol III-mediated transcription of
tRNA and other small noncoding RNA genes. Targeted cleavage of the H1RNA
moiety of RNase P altered enzyme specificity and diminished Pol III
transcription. Similarly, inactivation of RNase P protein subunits, such
as RPP38 (606116), by small interfering RNA inhibited Pol III function
and Pol III-directed promoter activity in the cell. RNase P exerted its
role in transcription through association with Pol III and chromatin of
active tRNA and 5S rRNA (180420) genes. Reiner et al. (2006) concluded
that RNase P has a role in Pol III transcription and that transcription
and early tRNA processing may be coordinated.

GENE STRUCTURE

Baer et al. (1989) determined that the flanking regions of the H1RNA
gene contain transcriptional control elements characteristic of both RNA
polymerase II and RNA polymerase III.

Myslinski et al. (2001) analyzed the H1RNA promoter region using various
transcription assays on mutant templates and DNA binding assays with
recombinant proteins. They found that the DNA elements required for
H1RNA transcription are typical of vertebrate small nuclear RNA promoter
elements. However, the promoter is unusually compact and is contained
within 100 bp of 5-prime flanking sequences.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analyses, Bartkiewicz et al. (1989) determined that
there are no more than 3 H1RNA genes, and Baer et al. (1989) predicted
that there is only a single gene. Baer et al. (1989) mapped the H1RNA
gene to chromosome 14q just below the centromere by analyzing a panel of
mouse-human hybrid chromosomes and by in situ hybridization.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a hepatoma cDNA expression library for clones that could
block mating pheromone-induced G1 arrest in yeast, Edwards et al. (1997)
cloned TBRG4, which they called CPR2. The deduced protein contains
multiple putative leucine zipper domains characteristic of transcription
factors.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned TBRG4, which they designated
KIAA0948. The transcript contains several repetitive elements in the
3-prime untranslated region. The deduced 521-amino acid protein shares
significant similarity with rat Cpr2. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate
expression in ovary, and little to no expression in all other tissues
and specific brain regions examined.

MAPPING

By FISH, Edwards et al. (1997) mapped the TBRG4 gene to chromosome
7p14-p13.

;;UROGUANYLIN; UGN;;
GUANYLATE CYCLASE C ACTIVATING PEPTIDE II;;
GCAP II
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Uroguanylin and guanylin (GUCA2A; 139392), peptide homologs of the
bacterial heat-stable enterotoxins (e.g., the E. coli ST toxin; STa),
are endogenous activators of the guanylate cyclase-2C receptor (GUCY2C;
601330), which synthesizes cyclic GMP (cGMP), a key component of several
intracellular signal transduction pathways.

CLONING

- Peptide Isolation

Kita et al. (1994) searched for members of the guanylin-like family and
purified a 16-amino acid peptide, which they termed uroguanylin, from
human urine. The uroguanylin peptide shares amino acid sequence homology
with guanylin. By systematic isolation of circulating regulatory
peptides that generate cGMP as second messengers, Hess et al. (1995)
identified a 24-amino acid peptide with a molecular mass of 2.6 kD,
which they termed guanylate cyclase C activating peptide II (GCAP II),
and identified as the 'circulating form of uroguanylin.' The 16
C-terminal amino acids are identical to uroguanylin, and 8 of 13
C-terminal residues are conserved between GCAP II, uroguanylin, and E.
coli STa. By immunohistochemistry, Hess et al. (1995) showed that GCAP
II localized to enteroendocrine cells of colonic mucosa.

- Gene Isolation

Using human uroguanylin cDNA as a probe to screen a human genomic
library, Miyazato et al. (1997) isolated the gene for uroguanylin and
determined the full-length sequence, which encodes a deduced 112-amino
acid protein. The entire nucleotide sequence that corresponds to the 16
amino acid residues of mature uroguanylin is included in the third exon.
The GUCA2B gene also has multiple binding sites for the
promoter-specific transcription factors AP1 (165160) and AP2 (107580),
and a cAMP-regulated enhancer element. RNA blot analysis showed that the
human uroguanylin mRNA is expressed in the gastric fundus and pylorus,
as well as in the intestine.

Whitaker et al. (1997) cloned the mouse Guca2b gene (which the authors
referred to as Guca1b). In the mouse, uroguanylin mRNA is most prominent
in the proximal small intestine, whereas guanylin mRNA is predominantly
expressed in distal small intestine and colon. The upstream promoter
sequence of the mouse uroguanylin gene contains consensus binding sites
for several known transcription factors, including HNF1 (142410) and Sp1
(189906).

GENE STRUCTURE

Miyazato et al. (1997) determined that the human GUCA2B gene contains 3
exons.

Whitaker et al. (1997) found that the mouse uroguanylin and guanylin
genes are structurally similar, both being composed of 3 short exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Miyazato et al. (1997) mapped the
human GUCA2B gene to chromosome 1p34-p33.

Whitaker et al. (1997) demonstrated that the mouse Guca2b gene is
tightly linked to the guanylin gene on mouse chromosome 4.

GENE FUNCTION

Kita et al. (1994) found that synthetic uroguanylin increased cGMP
levels in T84 cells, competed for receptors with (125)I-labeled ST, and
stimulated chloride secretion. Kita et al. (1994) discussed the
bioactivity of human uroguanylin in light of their previous
investigation of uroguanylin from opossum urine (Hamra et al., 1993).

Whitaker et al. (1997) noted that uroguanylin is an endogenous ligand of
the intestinal receptor guanylate cyclase-C and stimulates an increase
in cGMP, inducing chloride secretion via the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR; 602421). Although their
structural homologies and similar bioactivities suggest that guanylin
and uroguanylin are members of the same peptide family, their tissue
gene expression patterns differ, indicating that they may have different
roles in the regulation of epithelial functions.

Kinoshita et al. (1997) found significantly higher urinary excretion of
uroguanylin in persons on a high-salt rather than a low-salt diet. In
addition, their concentration of plasma uroguanylin increased with
increasing serum creatinine, and the 10-kD precursor of uroguanylin
increased as the severity of renal impairment increased. The findings
suggested that uroguanylin is involved in the regulation of electrolyte
homeostasis by the kidney.

In a review of the functions of uroguanylin, Forte et al. (1996) noted
that uroguanylin receptors are present on the luminal surface of
epithelial cells lining the intestinal tract and renal proximal tubules,
leading to salt and water secretion into the intestinal lumen as well as
the renal tubules. Uroguanylin mRNA is also expressed in both atria and
ventricles of the heart. Since uroguanylin circulates in the plasma of
normal individuals, it may function as an intestinal natriuretic hormone
and its secretion may be influenced by dietary levels of salt.

EVOLUTION

Whitaker et al. (1997) speculated that uroguanylin and guanylin may
represent gene duplications that have evolved to allow overlapping and
complementary patterns of expression in the intestine.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lorenz et al. (2003) found that transgenic uroguanylin knockout mice had
in an impaired ability to excrete an enteral load of NaCl, primarily due
to an inappropriate increase in renal Na+ absorption. They also had an
increase in mean arterial blood pressure that was independent of the
level of dietary salt intake. The authors concluded that uroguanylin
plays a role in an enteric-renal communication axis in the maintenance
of salt homeostasis in vivo.

;;RNA, U108 SMALL NUCLEOLAR; RNU108;;
RNA, E2 SMALL NUCLEOLAR; RNE2;;
snoRNA, E2
DESCRIPTION See 180645. Several of the known small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) species
have been shown to be required for processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
precursors. The genes of most of the known vertebrate snoRNA species are
located in introns of mRNA precursors (Maxwell and Fournier, 1995). E2
RNA is a nucleolar species that is 154-nucleotides long in the human.
Selvamurugan and Eliceiri (1995) stated that it belongs to a new family
of snoRNAs because it does not have the sequences named 'box C,'
'C-prime,' or 'D' that are present in most vertebrate snoRNA species,
and it does not bind fibrillarin (134795), the nucleolar protein
associated with most snoRNAs. E2 snoRNA is found in all tissues tested
in all vertebrates analyzed. Two observations are compatible with the
possibility that the human E2 RNA gene may be intronic. First, the human
gene lacks the intragenic flanking sequences that are functional in
other genes. Second, the 5-prime end of E2 RNA is monophosphorylated,
suggesting that it is formed by RNA processing. Intron-encoded snoRNAs
have monophosphorylated 5-prime termini. Selvamurugan and Eliceiri
(1995) demonstrated that the E2 gene resides in an intron of a
laminin-binding protein, the 67-kD laminin receptor (LAMR1; 150370).
Multiple copies (up to 16) of the LAMR1 gene per haploid genome are
present in the human.

603884	TITLE *603884 BCL2-ASSOCIATED ATHANOGENE 4; BAG4
;;SILENCER OF DEATH DOMAINS; SODD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1; 191190) and several other
members of the TNF receptor superfamily, such as DR3 (603366), contain
intracellular death domains and are capable of triggering apoptosis when
activated by their respective ligands. However, TNFR1 self-associates
and signals independently of ligand when overexpressed. Jiang et al.
(1999) suggested the existence of a cellular mechanism to protect
against ligand-independent signaling by TNFR1 and other death domain
receptors. Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay with DR3 as bait, these authors
identified a cDNA encoding a protein that they designated 'silencer of
death domains' (SODD). The predicted 457-amino acid SODD protein
migrates as a doublet of 60 kD on Western blots of mammalian cell
extracts. Coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed that SODD is associated
with TNFR1 in vivo. TNF treatment of cells released SODD from TNFR1,
permitting the recruitment of proteins such as TRADD (603500) and TRAF2
(601895) to the active TNFR1 signaling complex. Jiang et al. (1999)
proposed that SODD is a negative regulatory protein that is normally
associated with the death domain of TNFR1, inhibiting the intrinsic
self-aggregation properties of the death domain and maintaining TNFR1 in
an inactive, monomeric state. This inhibition is relieved by
TNF-mediated receptor crosslinking, which triggers the rapid release of
SODD, allowing the death domains of TNFR1 to self-associate and bind
other proteins to form an active TNFR1 signaling complex. These authors
found that SODD also interacted with DR3 in yeast 2-hybrid assays,
suggesting that SODD association may be representative of a general
mechanism for preventing spontaneous signaling by death
domain-containing receptors.

BAG1 (601497) binds the ATPase domains of Hsp70 (see 140550) and Hsc70
(600816), modulating their chaperone activity. See BAG2 (603882).
Takayama et al. (1999) identified cDNAs corresponding to BAG4 and 3
other BAG1-like proteins. These authors suggested that interactions with
various BAG family proteins allow opportunities for specification and
diversification of Hsp70/Hsc70 chaperone functions.

GENE FUNCTION

Pancreatic cancer cells are resistant to TNFA-mediated apoptosis. By
Northern blot analysis, Ozawa et al. (2000) detected a 5-fold increased
expression of 3.5-kb SODD transcripts in pancreatic cancer cells and
pancreatic cancer cell lines compared with normal pancreatic cells.
Other gastrointestinal cancers (liver, esophagus, stomach, and colon)
showed no increased SODD expression. In situ hybridization analysis
revealed expression of SODD in the cytoplasm of cancer cells.

By array CGH, Yang et al. (2006) analyzed the copy number and expression
level of genes in the 8p12-p11 amplicon in 22 human breast cancer
(114480) specimens and 7 breast cancer cell lines. Of the 21 potential
genes identified, PCR analysis and functional analysis indicated that 3
genes, LSM1 (607281), BAG4, and C8ORF4 (607702), are breast cancer
oncogenes that can work in combination to influence a transformed
phenotype in human mammary epithelial cells.

MAPPING

The BAG4 gene resides on chromosome 8p11 (Yang et al., 2006).

600126	TITLE *600126 PHOSPHODIESTERASE 4A, cAMP-SPECIFIC; PDE4A
;;DUNCE-LIKE PHOSPHODIESTERASE E2, FORMERLY; DPDE2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cyclic nucleotides are important second messengers that regulate and
mediate a number of cellular responses to extracellular signals, such as
hormones, light, and neurotransmitters. Cyclic nucleotide
phosphodiesterases (PDEs) regulate the cellular concentrations of cyclic
nucleotides and thereby play a role in signal transduction. PDE4A is a
class IV cAMP-specific PDE (summary by Milatovich et al., 1994).

CLONING

Livi et al. (1990) isolated a cDNA for a cAMP phosphodiesterase from
human monocytes. The deduced protein contains 686 amino acids. Northern
blot analysis detected a predominant transcript of about 4.8 kb in
primary human monocytes and placenta. Obernolte et al. (1993) identified
the monocyte clone as the homolog of rat Pde4a.

Using degenerate primers based on Drosophila dnc and rat Dpd to amplify
human Dpd orthologs, followed by low-stringency hybridization of a brain
cDNA library, Bolger et al. (1993) cloned full-length DPDE2, which they
called PDE46, and a possible splice variant. The major transcript
encodes a deduced 779-amino acid protein with 2 N-terminal domains that
share a high degree of conservation with other DPDE proteins, and a
C-terminal catalytic domain. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.5-kb
DPDE2 transcript in normal human temporal cortex. RNase protection
assays showed that DPDE2 was expressed in 6 of 7 cell lines examined.

The difference in sequence within the 5-prime region of the open reading
frame reported by Bolger et al. (1993) and Livi et al. (1990) was
examined by Sullivan et al. (1994), who confirmed the sequence reported
by Bolger et al. (1993).

Sullivan et al. (1998) characterized the first 'short' PDE4A isoenzyme.
Huston et al. (1996) had characterized the full-length human 'long'
PDE4A isoenzyme.

GENE FUNCTION

Bolger et al. (1993) confirmed that DPDE2 showed cAMP PDE activity,
which was inhibited by several cyclin nucleotide PDE inhibitors.

Wilson et al. (1994) characterized the PDE4A enzyme.

Growth hormone (GH; 139250) is an essential priming factor for the
differentiation of 3T3-F442A mouse preadipocytes into mature adipocytes.
MacKenzie et al. (1998) found that GH-mediated differentiation of
3T3-F442A cells was accompanied by increased cAMP phosphodiesterase
activity by a specific Pde4a isoform that they called Pde4a5. They
showed that activation of Pde4a5 countered GH-mediated differentiation
of 3T3-F442A cells. Activation of Pde4a5 was mediated by a
phosphorylation pathway involving Jak2 (147796), PI3 kinase (see
601232), and p70S6 (see 608938).

Vecsey et al. (2009) demonstrated that sleep deprivation selectively
impaired 3-prime, 5-prime-cAMP- and protein kinase A (PKA; see
176911)-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity in the mouse hippocampus,
reduced cAMP signaling, and increased activity and protein levels of
PDE4, an enzyme that degrades cAMP. Treatment of mice with
phosphodiesterase inhibitors rescued the sleep deprivation-induced
deficits in cAMP signaling, synaptic plasticity, and
hippocampus-dependent memory. Vecsey et al. (2009) concluded that their
findings demonstrated that brief sleep deprivation disrupts hippocampal
function by interfering with cAMP signaling through increased PDE4
activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sullivan et al. (1998) determined that the PDE4A gene spans 50 kb and
contains at least 17 exons.

MAPPING

Milatovich et al. (1994) assigned the PDE4A gene to human chromosome 19
by Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrid lines and to mouse
chromosome 9 by Southern analysis of recombinant inbred (RI) mouse
strains. Horton et al. (1995) confirmed the localization of PDE4A to
chromosome 19 by analysis of a human/hamster somatic cell hybrid panel.
Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, they regionalized the gene to
chromosome 19p13.2-q12.

Sullivan et al. (1998) determined that the PDE4A gene is 350 kb proximal
to TYK2 (176941) and 850 kb distal to LDLR (606945) on chromosome
19p13.2.

615036	TITLE *615036 MICRO RNA 410; MIR410
;;miRNA410
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Micro RNAs (miRNAs), such as MIR410, are small noncoding RNAs that
downregulate gene expression by promoting mRNA degradation or preventing
mRNA translation via sequence-specific interactions with target RNAs
(Gattolliat et al., 2011).

GENE FUNCTION

A combination of age at diagnosis, stage of disease, and amplification
of the MYCN gene (164840) define high- and low-risk neuroblastomas (see
256700). Using microarray expression profiling and quantitative RT-PCR,
Gattolliat et al. (2011) found that 15 of 17 miRNAs significantly
downregulated in high-risk neuroblastomas originated from a large miRNA
cluster on chromosome 14q. Of these, MIR410 and MIR487B (615037)
exhibited the highest fold change and discriminated high-risk from
low-risk neuroblastomas. Compared with high-risk neuroblastomas,
low-risk neuroblastomas showed expression of both MIR410 and MIR487B,
and MIR410 and MIR487B expression favored overall and disease-free
survival. No loss of copy number at this locus was found in high-risk
neuroblastomas, suggesting that downregulation of these miRNAs was
likely the result of transcriptional or processing regulation.

Richardson et al. (2013) found that MIR410 is a regulator of lipoprotein
lipase (LPL; 609708) and that the minor allele C of the SNP dbSNP
rs13702 in LPL (609708.0043) abolishes the response of a functional
MIR410 recognition element in the LPL 3-prime untranslated region.

MAPPING

Gattolliat et al. (2011) stated that the MIR410 gene maps to a large
miRNA cluster on chromosome 14q32.31.

613753	TITLE *613753 MICRO RNA 211; MIR211
;;miRNA211;;
MIRN211
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIR211, are small noncoding RNAs that
commonly basepair with sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of target mRNAs and
either inhibit mRNA translation or cause mRNA destabilization (Krol et
al., 2010).

CLONING

Krol et al. (2010) found that Mir211, Mir204 (610942), and the Mir183
(611608)/Mir96 (611606)/Mir182 (611607) cluster were highly expressed in
mouse retina. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that expression of Mir204 and
Mir211 was enriched in the microdissected inner nuclear layer, whereas
the Mir183/Mir9/Mir182 cluster was most abundant in photoreceptors.

GENE FUNCTION

Using expression arrays and quantitative RT-PCR, Krol et al. (2010)
showed that expression of Mir211, Mir204, and the Mir183/Mir96/Mir182
cluster was reversibly up- and downregulated in mouse retina during
light and dark adaptation, respectively. Increased accumulation of these
miRNAs upon light adaptation occurred independently of circadian rhythm.
The half-lives of these and other miRNAs appeared to be much shorter in
retinal neurons than in rod bipolar cells or Muller glia cells. Similar
rapid miRNA decay was observed in cultured rodent neurons and mouse
embryonic stem cell-derived neurons. Inhibitor studies revealed that
miRNA turnover was stimulated by neuronal activity.

Chen et al. (2010) found that miR211 regulates the vascular endothelial
growth factor angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1; 601667).

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the MIR211 gene to chromosome 15q13.3 based on an
alignment of the mature MIR211 sequence (UUCCCUUUGUCAUCCUUCGCCU) with
the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Krol et al. (2010) noted that the mouse Mir211 gene is located within an
intron of the Trpm1 gene (603576).

604026	TITLE *604026 GOLGI SNAP RECEPTOR COMPLEX MEMBER 1; GOSR1
;;GOS28;;
GOLGI SNARE, 28-KD; GS28
DESCRIPTION The specificity of vesicular transport is thought to be determined by
correct pairing of vesicle-associated SNAREs (v-SNAREs) with those on
the target membrane (t-SNAREs). This complex then recruits soluble NSF
attachment proteins (SNAPs) and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF;
601633) to form a 20S fusion (or SNARE) complex. See SNAPA (603215).
Nagahama et al. (1996) identified GOS28, a putative Golgi v-SNARE of 28
kD that localized primarily to transport vesicles at the terminal rims
of Golgi stacks. They demonstrated that GOS28 plays a role in
intra-Golgi transport. Subramaniam et al. (1996) isolated cDNAs encoding
rat GOS28, which they called p28 or GS28 (Golgi SNARE of 28 kD).
Sequence analysis revealed that the predicted protein contained a
central coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal membrane anchor. The authors
found that GS28 is a core component of the Golgi 20S SNARE complex that
participates in the docking or fusion stage of endoplasmic
reticulum-Golgi transport. Lowe et al. (1997) reported that GS28 plays a
role in transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cis- (inside
face) and medial-Golgi, while the GS27 (604027) Golgi SNARE participates
in protein movement from the medial-Golgi towards the trans- Golgi
(plasma-membrane face) and the trans-Golgi network.

By searching EST databases using the rat GS28 protein sequence, Bui et
al. (1999) identified human GS28 cDNAs. The deduced 250-amino acid human
protein is 97% identical to rat GS28. Independently, Mao et al. (1998)
identified a human GOS28 cDNA among a collection of cDNAs expressed in
hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.

By analysis of radiation hybrids and by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Bui et al. (1999) mapped the GS28 gene to 17q11.

171640	TITLE *171640 PHOSPHATASE, ACID, TYPE 5, TARTRATE-RESISTANT; ACP5
;;TARTRATE-RESISTANT ACID PHOSPHATASE; TRAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ketcham et al. (1988) cloned a full-length cDNA for type 5
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase from human placenta and found that
it contained an open reading frame of 969 basepairs (corresponding to a
protein of 323 amino acids), a putative signal sequence of 19 amino
acids, and 2 potential glycosylation sites. The deduced amino acid
sequence of the human isozyme is 85% identical to the amino acid
sequence of porcine uteroferrin and 82% identical to the corresponding
regions of a partial amino acid sequence of the bovine spleen enzyme.
The type 5 isozyme of acid phosphatase is the most basic of the acid
phosphatases and is the only form insensitive to inhibition by
L(+)-tartrate. Normally, it is detected as a minor intracellular
component of spleen, lung, liver, and bone. High levels of acid
phosphatase-5 are found within the spleen and monocytes of patients with
Gaucher disease (230800). The type 5 isozyme is an iron-containing
glycoprotein with a molecular mass of approximately 34 kD.

Lord et al. (1990) also isolated a clone for ACP5, which is found
principally in resident tissue macrophages. They found that an ACP5 cDNA
clone contained an open reading frame of 975 bp, encoded a protein of
325 amino acids, including a single peptide of 19 residues and 2
potential sites for N-glycosylation.

MAPPING

Allen et al. (1989) assigned the ACP5 gene to 15q22-q26 by in situ
hybridization both to normal metaphase chromosomes and to the
chromosomes of an individual carrying an unbalanced translocation
involving chromosome 15. However, Grimes et al. (1993) showed that the
Acp5 gene maps to mouse chromosome 9 in a group of genes that are
homologous to a group of genes on 19p13.3-p13.1. By Southern blot
analysis of somatic cell hybrids and use of a PCR method, Leach et al.
(1994) confirmed the assignment of ACP5 to chromosome 19. By isotopic in
situ hybridization, Lord et al. (1990) mapped the APC5 gene to
19p13.3-p13.2 with a peak at 19p13.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Lord et al. (1990) found that the expression of ACP5 mRNA was restricted
to mononuclear phagocytes and that the enzyme was induced more than
20-fold on transformation of normal human monocytes to macrophages by
culture in serum-supplemented medium.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 10 patients with spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation
(SPENCDI; 607944) from 8 families, Briggs et al. (2011) identified
homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for mutations in the ACP5 gene
(see, e.g., 171640.0001-171640.0004). In vivo testing confirmed a loss
of expressed protein, and all 8 cases assayed showed elevated serum
interferon alpha (see IFNA1, 147660) activity, with gene expression
profiling in whole blood defining a type I interferon signature.

Simultaneously and independently, Lausch et al. (2011) mapped SPENCDI to
chromosome 19p13 and identified homozygous or compound heterozygous
mutations in the ACP5 gene in 14 affected individuals from 11 families
(see, e.g., 171640.0004-171640.0007). Lausch et al. (2011) demonstrated
that the mutations abolished TRAP enzyme function in serum and cells of
affected individuals, and that phosphorylated osteopontin accumulated in
serum, urine, and cells cultured from TRAP-deficient individuals.
Case-derived dendritic cells exhibited an altered cytokine profile and
were more potent than matched controls in stimulating allogeneic T-cell
proliferation in mixed lymphocyte reactions.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hayman et al. (1996) observed that mice with a targeted disruption of
the Acp5 gene, or Trap, suffered from developmental deformities of the
limb and axial skeleton and had osteoclasts defective in bone
resorption, resulting in mild osteopetrosis.

Bune et al. (2001) determined that macrophages of Acp5-deficient mice
had compensatory acid phosphatase activity attributable to the Acp2 gene
(171650) and enhanced proinflammatory responses in vitro. However, mice
lacking Acp5 showed delayed clearance of Staphylococcus aureus in vivo,
which was associated with reduced numbers of peritoneal macrophages, in
spite of normal macrophage and neutrophil phagocytosis and killing in
vitro.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPONDYLOENCHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH IMMUNE DYSREGULATION
ACP5, THR89ILE

In a Turkish brother and sister with spondyloenchondrodysplasia and
immune dysregulation (607944), born of first-cousin parents, Briggs et
al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 266C-T transition in exon 4 of
the ACP5 gene, resulting in a thr89-to-ile (T89I) substitution at a
highly conserved residue. The brother, who was previously reported by
Navarro et al. (2008), presented at age 22 months with spasticity and a
vasculitic skin rash. Upon evaluation at 11 years of age, plasma levels
of total TRAP protein were negligible and TRAP 5a protein was
undetectable, and he had spasticity and intracranial calcifications,
elevated antinuclear antibody and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody
titers, and hypocomplementemia. His older sister, who was evaluated at
14 years of age for short stature, had a history of Raynaud phenomenon
but did not have elevated ANA or anti-dsDNA titers; she was, however,
found to have a high level of interferon-alpha (147660) in serum.

.0002
SPONDYLOENCHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH IMMUNE DYSREGULATION
ACP5, GLN223TER

In an 11-year-old Pakistani boy with spondyloenchondrodysplasia and
immune dysregulation (607944), born of first-cousin parents and
previously reported by Renella et al. (2006) as 'patient 10' (Crow,
2011), Briggs et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 667C-T
transition in the ACP5 gene, resulting in a gln223-to-ter (Q223X)
substitution. Plasma levels of total TRAP protein were negligible and
TRAP 5a protein was undetectable in this patient, indicating an almost
complete lack of TRAP synthesis or secretion. In addition to skeletal
manifestations, the patient had elevated antinuclear antibody and
anti-double-stranded DNA antibody titers and autoimmune hemolytic
anemia.

.0003
SPONDYLOENCHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH IMMUNE DYSREGULATION
ACP5, MET264LYS

In a female patient with spondyloenchondrodysplasia and immune
dysregulation (607944), who was born of first-cousin parents of
Portuguese descent and was originally reported by Roifman and Melamed
(2003), Briggs et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 791T-A
transversion in exon 7 of the ACP5 gene, resulting in a met264-to-lys
(M264K) substitution. Computational analysis indicated that this change
was likely to destabilize the structure of the protein. In addition to
skeletal changes, the patient had a history of recurrent infections,
elevated antinuclear antibody and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody
titers, thrombocytopenia requiring splenectomy, nonerosive arthropathy,
systemic lupus erythematosus, and hypothyroidism.

.0004
SPONDYLOENCHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH IMMUNE DYSREGULATION
ACP5, GLY215ARG

In a female patient from Mali with spondyloenchondrodysplasia and immune
dysregulation (607944), Briggs et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for
a 643G-A transition in exon 6 of the ACP5 gene, resulting in a
gly215-to-arg (G215R) substitution. This patient, who presented at 6
years of age with nephropathy, also had severe short stature with
metaphyseal dysplasia, elevated antinuclear antibody and
anti-double-stranded DNA antibody titers, and systemic lupus
erythematosus with class V lupus nephritis on renal biopsy.

In 2 unrelated girls with spondyloenchondrodysplasia, 14 years and 10
years of age, respectively, Lausch et al. (2011) identified homozygosity
for the G215R mutation in the ACP5 gene. In addition to skeletal
changes, the older girl had chronic thrombocytopenia, ataxia,
leukodystrophy, and basal ganglia calcifications, whereas the younger
girl had only calcifications of the left globus pallidus without
immunologic or neurologic symptoms. The mutation was not found in 228
control alleles.

.0005
SPONDYLOENCHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH IMMUNE DYSREGULATION
ACP5, GLY109ARG

In 2 sibs with spondyloenchondrodysplasia and immune dysregulation
(607944), Lausch et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 325G-A
transition in exon 7 of the ACP5 gene, resulting in a gly109-to-arg
(G109R) substitution. In addition to skeletal changes, both sibs had
systemic lupus erythematosus, the older sib also had arthralgia and
vitiligo, and the younger sib had arthritis; the older sib also had mild
developmental delay and diffuse intracranial calcifications as well as
of the basal ganglia, and the younger sib had basal ganglia and right
frontal lobe calcifications, but neither sib displayed neurologic signs.
In 2 additional affected individuals from unrelated families, 1 of whom
was the patient originally reported by Scharer (1958), Lausch et al.
(2011) identified compound heterozygosity for the G109R mutation and
another mutation in the ACP5 gene (see 171640.0006 and 171640.0007).
None of the mutations was found in 228 control alleles.

.0006
SPONDYLOENCHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH IMMUNE DYSREGULATION
ACP5, 3-BP DEL, 831CTA

In a 64-year-old Ashkenazi Jewish man with spondyloenchondrodysplasia
and immune dysregulation (607944), who was originally reported by
Scharer (1958) and later studied by Renella et al. (2006), Lausch et al.
(2011) identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in the ACP5
gene: a 3-bp deletion (813delCTA) in exon 7 and a G109R substitution
(171640.0005). The patient was diagnosed with systemic lupus
erythematosus at 9.5 years of age but was subsequently lost to
follow-up; the diagnosis of spondyloenchondrodysplasia was made 40 years
later upon reevaluation of his radiographs. In adulthood he had
continued to have recurrent fevers and arthralgias and developed
antiphospholipid syndrome, steroid-dependent neutropenia, and
thrombocytopenia.

.0007
SPONDYLOENCHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH IMMUNE DYSREGULATION
ACP5, LEU201PRO

In a 12-year-old patient with spondyloenchondrodysplasia and immune
dysregulation (607944), Lausch et al. (2011) identified compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the ACP5 gene: a 602T-C transition in
exon 6, resulting in a leu201-to-pro (L201P) substitution, and a G109R
substitution (171640.0005). In addition to skeletal manifestations, the
patient had thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, elevated
antinuclear antibody titers, childhood-onset spastic diplegia, and
calcification of the basal ganglia and frontal subcortical area.
