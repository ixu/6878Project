;;MITOCHONDRIAL MALONYLTRANSFERASE;;
MT, MITOCHONDRIAL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MCAT (EC 2.3.1.39) is the catalytic subunit of the type II
malonyl-CoA-dependent system for biosynthesis of fatty acids in
mitochondria (Zhang et al., 2003).

CLONING

Zhang et al. (2003) cloned human MCAT, which they called mitochondrial
MT. The deduced 390-amino acid protein has an N-terminal cleavable
mitochondrial targeting signal, a GxSxG serine esterase active-site
motif, and conserved arg and his residues required for activity.
Fluorescence-tagged MCAT colocalized with a mitochondrial marker
following expression in HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2003) found that human mitochondrial MT expressed in
insect cells had a narrower substrate specificity than cytosolic MT
(FASN; 600212) and transferred a malonyl moiety to the mitochondrial
malonyl acceptor ACP (NDUFAB1; 603836) only.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2003) determined that the MCAT gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang et al. (2003) mapped the MCAT gene
to chromosome 22q13.31.

611966	TITLE *611966 TRAFFICKING PROTEIN PARTICLE COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 9; TRAPPC9
;;NIK- AND IKBKB-BINDING PROTEIN; NIBP;;
KIAA1882
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NIBP binds NIK (604655) and IKK-beta (IKBKB; 603258) and plays a role in
the neuronal NF-kappa-B (see 164011) signaling pathway (Hu et al.,
2005).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from an adult amygdala cDNA library,
Nagase et al. (2001) cloned a partial cDNA encoding NIBP, which they
designated KIAA1882. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression in all
tissues and specific brain regions examined.

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a human brain cDNA library using
N-terminal NIK (MAP3K14; 604655) as bait, followed by database analysis,
Hu et al. (2005) cloned NIBP. The deduced 1,246-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 139.4 kD and shares 80 to 90% homology with
the corresponding rodent sequences. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected a 4.5-kb transcript with high expression in muscle and
kidney, and lower levels in brain, heart, and placenta; 2 smaller
transcripts of 2.1 and 1.5 kb were also detected. Immunohistochemical
studies detected NIBP protein in neuronal cells in mouse brain with
staining localized to cell bodies and neuronal processes in the
pyramidal layer of mouse cortex, spinal cord motor neurons, and white
matter neurons.

Mochida et al. (2009) noted that there are 2 transcript variants of
TRAPPC9 in humans. Variant 1 is the longer form and encodes a
1,246-amino acid protein. Variant 2 uses an alternate 5-prime exon
initiating translation at a downstream start codon and encodes a
1,148-amino acid protein. In situ hybridization showed low levels of
expression in mouse embryonic brain with strong expression in adult
brain. Trappc9 was found in neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus,
and deep gray matter. Trappc9 immunoreactivity was widespread in the
cytoplasm, without specific localization to any particular organelle,
and was not found in the nucleus. In 11.5-week human embryonic brain,
there was higher expression in the developing cortical plate compared to
the ventricular zone, indicating higher expression in postmitotic
neurons than in progenitor cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hu et al. (2005) determined that the TRAPPC9 gene contains 23 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hu et al. (2005) mapped the TRAPPC9 gene
to chromosome 8q24.3.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays, Hu et al. (2005)
showed that NIBP interacted with NIK and IKK-beta but showed no
interaction with IKK-alpha (CHUK; 600664) or IKK-gamma (IKBKG; 300248).
NIBP overexpression in HEK293T cells potentiated TNFA (191160)-induced
NF-kappa-B activation through increased phosphorylation of the IKK
complex and its downstream substrates IKBA (NFKBIA; 164008) and p65
(NFKB3; 164014). Mobility shift assays demonstrated increased NF-kappa-B
DNA binding. Knockdown of NIBP by siRNA reduced TNFA-induced NF-kappa-B
activation, prevented NGF (see 162030)-induced neuronal differentiation,
and decreased BCLXL (see BCL2L1; 600039) gene expression in PC12 cells.
Hu et al. (2005) suggested that NIBP may act as an adaptor to recruit
NIK or other kinases to the IKK complex, and that NIBP acts as a
downstream component of NGF in neuronal cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By genomewide linkage analysis, followed by candidate gene sequencing,
of an Israeli Arab family with nonsyndromic mental retardation (MRT13;
613192), Mochida et al. (2009) identified a homozygous truncating
mutation in the TRAPPC9 gene (R475X; 611966.0001).

Mir et al. (2009) identified the R475X mutation in affected members of a
Pakistani family with MRT13 and identified a 4-bp deletion (611966.0003)
in affected members of an Iranian family with MRT13, previously reported
by Najmabadi et al. (2007).

Philippe et al. (2009) identified a nonsense mutation in the TRAPPC9
gene (611966.0002) in 3 Tunisian brothers with autosomal recessive
mental retardation.

In 2 sisters, born of unrelated parents from southern Italy, with MRT13,
Marangi et al. (2013) identified a homozygous truncating mutation in the
TRAPPC9 gene (611966.0004).

MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 13
TRAPPC9, ARG475TER

In affected members of an Israeli Arab family with nonsyndromic
autosomal recessive mental retardation and postnatal microcephaly
(MRT13; 613192), Mochida et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 1423C-T
transition in exon 7 of the TRAPPC9 gene, resulting in an arg475-to-ter
(R475X) substitution in TRAPPC9 variant 1. The same change represents
1129C-T, resulting in an arg377-to-ter (R377X) substitution, in TRAPPC9
variant 2. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the mutation, and
it was not identified in 306 control chromosomes. The protein was not
detected in patient lymphoblast cell lines.

Mir et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 1422C-T transition in the
TRAPPC9 gene, resulting in an R475X mutation, in affected members of a
large consanguineous Pakistani family with mental retardation. The
mutant protein was not expressed, consistent with nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay. Affected individuals had borderline microcephaly, delayed
walking, and white matter abnormalities on brain MRI.

Abou Jamra et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for the R475X mutation
in affected members of a large consanguineous Syrian family with
autosomal recessive mental retardation. The patients had neonatal
hypotonia, severe motor delay with walking between ages 5 and 7 years,
single words or no speech, growth retardation, stereotypic movements,
and hand flapping. They also shared some dysmorphic features, including
low frontal hairline, synophrys, and microcephaly.

MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 13
TRAPPC9, ARG570TER

In 3 brothers, born of consanguineous Tunisian parents, with autosomal
recessive mental retardation (MRT13; 613192), Philippe et al. (2009)
identified a homozygous 1708C-T transition in exon 9 of the TRAPPC9
gene, resulting in an arg570-to-ter (R570X) substitution. The mutation
was not found in 1,120 control chromosomes. The protein was not detected
in patient fibroblasts, and the authors postulated nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay. In cultured patient fibroblasts, stimulation with TNF-alpha
(191160) showed a defect in IKBA (NFKBIA; 164008) degradation,
suggesting impaired function of the NF-kappa-B (see 164011) signaling
pathway.

In affected members of an Iranian family (M001) with mental retardation
(613192), previously reported by Najmabadi et al. (2007) as showing
linkage to chromosome 8q24, Mir et al. (2009) identified a 4-bp deletion
(2311delTGTT) in the TRAPPC9 gene, resulting in a frameshift and
premature termination. Affected members had severe nonsyndromic mental
retardation, were ambulatory but nonverbal, and had microcephaly. There
were no seizures or dysmorphic features.

TRAPPC9, IVS17AS, A-C, -2

In 2 sisters, born of unrelated parents from southern Italy, with MRT13
(613192), Marangi et al. (2013) identified a homozygous A-to-C
transversion in intron 17 of the TRAPPC9 gene (2851-2A-C), resulting in
the skipping of exon 18, a frameshift, and premature termination
(Thr951TyrfsTer17). Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the
mutation, which was identified by exome sequencing. PCR analysis of
patient cells did not show reduction of the TRAPPC9 transcript in the 2
sisters.

611596	TITLE *611596 SHORT-CHAIN DEHYDROGENASE/REDUCTASE FAMILY, MEMBER 4; DHRS4
;;SDR FAMILY, MEMBER 4;;
NADPH-DEPENDENT RETINOL DEHYDROGENASE/REDUCTASE; NRDR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase enzymes, like DHRS4, are
NAD/NADP-dependent oxidoreductases that function in the breakdown of
steroids, retinoids, prostaglandins, and xenobiotics. DHRS2 also has a
noncatalytic role in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis
(summary by Gabrielli and Tofanelli, 2012).

CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of rat Dhrs4, Fransen et al. (1999)
identified 3 variants of human DHRS4, which they called SDR-SRL because
the protein belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR)
family and has a C-terminal SRL peroxisome-targeting sequence.
Fluorescence-tagged rat Dhrs4 localized to peroxisomes in transfected
Chinese hamster ovary cells.

By RT-PCR and RACE of a human liver cDNA library, Du et al. (2004)
cloned full-length DHRS4, which they called NRDR, and a shorter variant
lacking exons 4, 5, and 6. Both deduced proteins contain a classical
alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)-short domain, a short-chain ADH (SCAD)
motif, phosphorylation and fatty acylation sites, and a peroxisomal
targeting signal. RT-PCR detected variable expression of both
transcripts in most tissues examined.

By RT-PCR and RACE of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Song et al. (2007)
cloned full-length NRDR and a variant lacking exon 3, which they called
NRDRB1. The deduced NRDR and NRDRB1 proteins have calculated molecular
masses of 29 and 27 kD, respectively. Song et al. (2007) detected NRDRB1
mRNA expression in 14 (53.9%) of 26 cervical cancer tissues, but
expression was not detected in 12 normal cervical tissues.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected NRDRB1 protein only in tumor
tissues. The full-length NRDR mRNA was observed in both normal and
neoplastic cervical tissues, but NRDR protein was only expressed in
normal cervical epithelium, where it localized in peroxisomes.

Gabrielli and Tofanelli (2012) reported that the full-length DHRS4
protein contains 278 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Gabrielli and Tofanelli (2012) noted that differences in the
substrate-binding sites of DHRS2 (615194) and DHRS4 are associated with
different substrate specificities. In general, DHRS4 accepts a broader
range of substrates than DHRS2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Du et al. (2004) determined that the DHRS4 gene contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Du et al. (2004) mapped the DHRS4 gene to
chromosome 14q11.2.

EVOLUTION

Gabrielli and Tofanelli (2012) found that DHRS2 and DHRS4, which are
located within 315 kb of each other on chromosome 14, originated from a
duplication of the DHRS4 gene that took place before the formation of
the mammalian clade. DHRS2 evolved more rapidly and underwent positive
selection on more sites than the DHRS4 gene. DHRS2 sites under positive
selection were mainly located in the enzyme active site. Two other
duplicated DHRS4 genes, DHRS4L2 (615196) and DHRS4L1 (615195), are
located 20 and 47 kb downstream of DHRS4, respectively.

602120	TITLE *602120 CHROMODOMAIN HELICASE DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 3; CHD3
;;Mi2-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION See CHD1 (602118) for a description of this gene family.

CLONING

Anti-Mi2 autoantibody is strongly associated with dermatomyositis and is
found in sera of 20% of dermatomyositis patients. Mi2 antigen consists
of at least 8 components. By immunoscreening human thymocyte and HeLa
cell cDNA expression libraries with anti-Mi2 patient sera, Ge et al.
(1995) isolated a partial cDNA encoding Mi2-alpha, or CHD3. The deduced
partial protein contains 4 potential zinc finger domains. Antibodies
against recombinant Mi2-alpha reacted with a 240-kD HeLa cell protein.
Northern blot analysis detected a single 7.5- to 8.0-kb Mi2-alpha
transcript in HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Seelig et al. (1996) noted that the Mi2-alpha and Mi2-beta (CHD4;
603277) proteins react with most or all dermatomyositis patient anti-Mi2
sera. While these proteins are distinct, they have stretches of
identical sequence that could result in shared epitopes.

Woodage et al. (1997) characterized the CHD3 gene. The predicted
1,944-amino acid protein shares 22.9% identity and 34.5% similarity
overall with the mouse Chd1 gene product.

MAPPING

Woodage et al. (1997) mapped the CHD3 gene to 17p13 by PCR screening of
the Genebridge 4 radiation hybrid mapping panel.

611430	TITLE *611430 TETRATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 21A; TTC21A
;;STRESS-INDUCIBLE PROTEIN 2; STI2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis to identify putative coding sequences in a region
of chromosome 3 associated with carcinomas, Protopopov et al. (2003)
identified TTC21A, which they called ST12. The deduced 1,320-amino acid
protein contains 10 N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeats of about 34
amino acids each. Northern blot analysis detected strong expression of a
6.5-kb transcript only in testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Protopopov et al. (2003) determined that the TTC21A gene contains 27
exons and spans about 27 kb.

MAPPING

Using FISH and a deletion cell hybrid panel, Protopopov et al. (2003)
mapped the TTC21A gene to chromosome 3p21.3.

607074	TITLE *607074 PROTEIN KINASE D2; PRKD2
;;PKD2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching with the conserved C-terminal sequence of
serine kinases and screening of a human ductal pancreatic cDNA library,
Sturany et al. (2001) cloned a novel serine/threonine protein kinase,
which they called PKD2. The deduced 878-amino acid protein, which has a
predicted molecular mass of 97 kD, contains an N-terminal hydrophobic
area predicted to be a transmembrane region, 2 cysteine-rich motifs that
form zinc finger-like repeats, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a
putative kinase domain containing the ATP-binding consensus sequence. An
invariant aspartate essential for kinase activity is located within a
motif conserved in serine/threonine kinases. The first zinc finger-like
domain shares 88% identity to the corresponding domains in PKD/PKC-mu
(PRKCM; 605435) and PKC-nu (PRKCN; 607077). Northern blot analysis
detected constitutive low expression of a 4-kb transcript; higher levels
were observed in pancreas, heart, lung, smooth muscle, and brain, and
lower levels kidney and liver. SDS-PAGE revealed a protein with a
molecular mass of 105 kD, as did Western blot analysis of endogenous
PRKD2 or protein expressed following transfection.

GENE FUNCTION

Sturany et al. (2001) demonstrated phorbol ester binding to the duplex
zinc finger-like motif of PRKD2 as well as autophosphorylation following
phorbol ester stimulation. The addition of phosphatidyl-L-serine caused
synergistic stimulation. Phorbol ester-activated PRKD2 migrated more
slowly than inactive PRKD2 by SDS-PAGE, suggesting hyperphosphorylation
upon activation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PRKD2
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP R67403).

;;EIF3-p110;;
EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 3, SUBUNIT 8, FORMERLY; EIF3S8,
FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Eukaryotic initiation factor-3 (eIF3) is the largest of the eIFs and
consists of at least 10 nonidentical subunits, including EIF2C (Asano et
al., 1997).

CLONING

Asano et al. (1997) demonstrated that the 115-kD component of HeLa cell
eIF3 is actually composed of 2 proteins, p116 (PRT1; 603917) and p110.
By screening a HeLa cell expression library with antibodies against the
115-kD band, these authors identified cDNAs encoding p110. The predicted
913-amino acid p110 protein has a pI of 5.8 and is unrelated to p116.
p110 shares 31% identity to the S. cerevisiae Nip1 protein, which is
thought to be involved in nuclear import and the initiation phase of
protein synthesis. Asano et al. (1997) found that the p116, p110, and
p36 (603911) subunits localize on 40S ribosomes in cells active in
translation and coimmunoprecipitate with p170 (602039), indicating that
these proteins are integral components of eIF3. Northern blot analysis
revealed that p110 is expressed as a 3-kb mRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

By reciprocal yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses of the
human STS26T malignant schwannoma cell line, Scoles et al. (2006) showed
that isoforms 1 and 2 of schwannomin (NF2; 607379) interacted with
EIF3C. Mutation analysis revealed that the FERM domain of schwannomin
interacted with the C-terminal half of EIF3C. Immunofluorescence
microscopy of STS26T cells showed that the 2 proteins partly colocalized
at punctate perinuclear structures and at some membranous structures.
Overexpression of EIF3C in STS26T cells elevated cell proliferation, and
schwannomin countered this effect. Western blot analysis revealed an
inverse abundance of schwannomin and EIF3C in human meningiomas.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the EIF3C gene to chromosome 16p11.2 based on an
alignment of the EIF3C sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC000533) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37). A nearly identical copy of EIF3C, designated
EIF3CL, also maps to chromosome 16p11.2.

608487	TITLE *608487 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5; TRIM5
;;RNF88
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRIM5 belongs to the large tripartite motif protein family, members of
which typically are composed of 3 zinc-binding domains, a RING, unique
B-box type 1 and B-box type 2 domains, followed by a coiled-coil (CC)
region. TRIM proteins use homomultimerization to identify specific cell
compartments.

CLONING

Using a consensus B-box domain to screen dbEST databases, Reymond et al.
(2001) identified 37 TRIM members in mammals, 21 of which were novel, as
well as 34 splice variants. TRIM5 has 6 variants termed alpha, beta,
gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta, all of which lack a B-box type 1
domain. Additional domains C-terminal to the CC region are variably
present. TRIM5-zeta lacks RING, B-box, and CC domains, but possesses 3
RFP-like domains. Northern blot analysis of adult human tissues detected
ubiquitous expression of TRIM5. Using interaction mating and mutation
analysis, Reymond et al. (2001) confirmed that TRIM5, like most TRIMs,
homointeracts through the CC region. Interaction was also detected with
TRIM6 (607564). Green fluorescent protein microscopy demonstrated
expression as cytoplasmic speckles, possibly in novel subcellular
compartments.

Stremlau et al. (2004) determined that human TRIM5-alpha contains 493
amino acids and includes a C-terminal b30.2 (SPRY) domain missing in
other TRIM5 isoforms.

GENE FUNCTION

By fluorescence microscopy and mutation analysis, Xu et al. (2003)
showed that TRIM5-delta interacts with BTBD1 (608530) and BTBD2
(608531), apparently serving as a scaffold for the assembly of
endogenous BTBD1/2 proteins, dependent on the presence of the CC region
and a wildtype RING domain. TRIM5-delta exhibits ubiquitylation in the
presence of UBCH5B (UBE2D2; 602962), dependent on the presence of
zinc-coordinating cysteines in the RING domain.

Kaiser et al. (2007) reported the reconstruction of the core protein of
a 4-million-year-old endogenous virus from the chimpanzee genome
(PtERV1) and showed that the human variant of the intrinsic immune
protein TRIM5-alpha can actively prevent infection by this virus.
However, Kaiser et al. (2007) suggested that the selective changes that
have occurred in the human lineage during the acquisition of resistance
to this virus, and perhaps similar viruses, may have left our species
more susceptible to infection by HIV-1.

Pertel et al. (2011) demonstrated that TRIM5 promotes innate immune
signaling and that this activity is amplified by retroviral infection
and interaction with the capsid lattice. Acting with the heterodimeric
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13-UEV1A, TRIM5 catalyzes the synthesis
of unattached K63-linked ubiquitin chains that activate the TAK1
(602614) kinase complex and stimulate AP1 (see 165160) and NF-kappa-B
(see 164011) signaling. Interaction with the HIV-1 capsid lattice
greatly enhanced the UBC13-UEV1A-dependent E3 activity of TRIM5, and
challenge with retroviruses induced the transcription of AP1- and
NF-kappa-B-dependent factors with a magnitude that tracked with TRIM5
avidity for the invading capsid. Finally, TAK1 and UBC13-UEV1A
contributed to capsid-specific restriction by TRIM5. Pertel et al.
(2011) concluded that the retroviral restriction factor TRIM5 has 2
additional activities that are linked to restriction: it constitutively
promotes innate immune signaling, and it acts as a pattern recognition
receptor specific for the retrovirus capsid lattice.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Reymond et al. (2001) mapped the TRIM5
gene to chromosome 11p15, in a cluster with TRIM6, TRIM21 (109092),
TRIM22 (606559), TRIM34 (605684), and a TRIM pseudogene. The authors
noted that, apart from another cluster in the HLA region (chromosome
6p21-23), TRIM genes are dispersed throughout the genome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Stremlau et al. (2004) noted that HIV-1, the cause of acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans, efficiently enters the cells
of Old World monkeys but encounters a block before reverse
transcription. The block acts on the HIV-1 capsid and is mediated by a
dominant repressive factor. By screening HeLa cell lines transduced with
a cDNA library from rhesus fibroblasts, Stremlau et al. (2004)
identified HeLa cells expressing rhesus TRIM5-alpha. These cells were
resistant to HIV-1 but not simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)
infection. PCR analysis indicated a disruption of viral cDNA synthesis
in rhesus TRIM5-alpha-expressing cells. Mutation analysis suggested that
both the N-terminal RING and C-terminal SPRY domains of rhesus
TRIM5-alpha contribute to its HIV-1 inhibitory activity. Short
interfering (si) RNA experiments reducing rhesus TRIM5-alpha expression
resulted in increased efficiency of HIV-1 infection. Stremlau et al.
(2004) concluded that monkey TRIM5-alpha is the repressive factor
inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcription and proposed that rhesus
TRIM5-alpha may directly bind and ubiquitinate the HIV-1 viral capsid.

Sayah et al. (2004) showed that knockdown of owl monkey CYPA (123840) by
RNA interference (RNAi) correlated with suppression of anti-HIV-1
activity. However, reintroduction of CYPA to RNAi-treated cells did not
restore antiviral activity. A search for additional RNAi targets
identified TRIMCYP, an RNAi-responsive mRNA encoding a TRIM5/CYPA fusion
protein. TRIMCYP accounts for post-entry restriction of HIV-1 in owl
monkeys and blocks HIV-1 infection when transferred to otherwise
infectable human or rat cells. Sayah et al. (2004) suggested that
TRIMCYP arose after the divergence of New and Old World primates when a
LINE-1 retrotransposon catalyzed the insertion of a CYPA cDNA into the
TRIM5 locus. They concluded that this was the first vertebrate example
of a chimeric gene generated by this mechanism of exon shuffling.

Sakuma et al. (2007) showed that rhesus Trim5-alpha, but not human
TRIM5-alpha, blocked late-phase HIV-1 production through rapid
degradation of HIV-1 Gag polyproteins. In agreement with Sakuma et al.
(2007), Zhang et al. (2008) found that rhesus Trim5-alpha could block
late-stage HIV-1, but not macaque SIV, production. However, the amount
of Trim5-alpha required for this effect was much higher than that
endogenously expressed, and they questioned the biologic significance of
the finding. In a reply, Sakuma et al. (2008) suggested that technical
differences, such as cell lines and capsid sequences, may explain the
need for high Trim5-alpha expression in the experiments of Zhang et al.
(2008).

MIXED LINEAGE LEUKEMIA, TRANSLOCATED TO, 2;;
ALL1-FUSED GENE FROM CHROMOSOME 4; AF4
DESCRIPTION The ALL1 gene (MLL; 159555), located at 11q23, is rearranged in acute
leukemias with reciprocal translocations between this region and
chromosomes 1, 4, 6 (159559), 9 (159558), 10, or 19 (159556). Gu et al.
(1992) studied the t(4;11) translocation which results in 2 reciprocal
fusion products coding for chimeric proteins derived from ALL1 and from
a gene on chromosome 4. They referred to the latter as AF4 for
'ALL1-fused gene from chromosome 4.' Fused RNAs were found in the three
t(4;11) cells lines studied; therefore, Gu et al. (1992) could not
establish which of the 2 products is oncogenic.

Nakamura et al. (1993) found that the gene on chromosome 4q21 that is
fused with the ALL1 gene in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia
and translocation t(4;11)(q21;q23) and the gene on chromosome 9 that is
fused with the ALL1 gene on chromosome 11 in patients with leukemia and
the t(9;11)(p22;q23) show high sequence homology with the ENL gene on
chromosome 19, which is fused to the ALL1 gene in patients with leukemia
and the translocation t(11;19)(q23;p13). They found further that the
protein products of the AF4, AF9 (MLLT3), and ENL (MLLT1) genes
contained nuclear targeting sequences as well as serine-rich and
proline-rich regions. Stretches abundant in basic amino acids were also
present in the 3 proteins. These results indicated that the different
proteins fused to ALL1 polypeptides in leukemia provide similar
functional domains.

Domer et al. (1993) independently demonstrated that the derivative
chromosome 11, carrying a translocated segment of chromosome 4, encodes
a fusion RNA which predicts a chimeric protein with features of the MLL
gene on 11q23 and the AF4 gene on 4q21. The sequence of the complete
open reading frame for this fusion transcript revealed that the MLL
protein is homologous with DNA methyltransferase, the Drosophila
trithorax gene product, and the 'AT-hook' motif of high mobility group
proteins. An alternative splice that deletes the AT-hook region of MLL
was identified. AF4 is a serine- and proline-rich putative transcription
factor with a glutamine-rich carboxyl terminus. The composition of the
complete MLL-AF4 fusion product argues that it may act through either a
gain-of-function or a dominant-negative mechanism in leukemogenesis.
This gene is also symbolized MLLT2.

Uckun et al. (1998) analyzed bone marrow leukemic cells of 17 infants
and 127 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL), as
well as fetal liver and bone marrow and normal infant bone marrow
samples for the presence of a t(4;11) translocation, using standard
cytogenetic techniques and expression of an MLL-AF4 fusion transcript by
standard RT-PCR assays as well as nested RT-PCR that is 100-fold more
sensitive than the standard RT-PCR. Overall, 9 of the 17 infants and 17
of 127 noninfant pediatric ALL patients were positive for expression of
MLL-AF4 fusion transcripts. None of the MLL-AF4(+) cases were positive
for E2A-PBX1 (147141; 176310) or BCR-ABL (151410; 189980) fusion
transcript expression. Although 8 of 9 MLL-AF4(+) infants had
cytogenetically detectable t(4;11) translocation, 15 of the 17
MLL-AF4(+) noninfants were t(4;11) negative. Infants with MLL-AF4(+) ALL
had poor outcomes, whereas noninfant fusion-gene-positive,
translocation-negative patients has favorable outcomes similar to
MLL-AF4(-) patients. Notably, MLL-AF4 transcripts also were detected by
nested RT-PCR in 4 of 16 fetal bone marrows, 5 of 13 fetal livers, and 1
of 6 normal infant bone marrows, but not in any of the 44 remission bone
marrow specimens from pediatric ALL patients. These results represented
unprecedented evidence that MLL-AF4 fusion transcripts can be present in
normal hematopoietic cells, indicating that their expression is
insufficient for leukemic transformation of normal lymphocyte
precursors.

Isnard et al. (1998) isolated cDNA clones of the mouse Af4 gene. By
Northern analysis, they detected a single transcript of approximately 10
kb in all adult tissues examined, with highest expression in thymus,
lymph nodes, and kidney. They also studied expression in fetal thymus
and liver. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, they showed that the
Af4 gene maps to the E region of mouse chromosome 5, which is syntenic
with human 4q21.

To gain insight into the translocation mechanism and the relevant drug
exposure in treatment-related leukemia, Lovett et al. (2001) analyzed
the der(11) and der(4) genomic breakpoint junctions of a t(4;11)
translocation in the leukemia of a patient previously administered
etoposide and dactinomycin for the chemotherapy of primary alveolar
rhabdomyosarcoma (268220). The genomic breakpoint junctions involved
intron 6 of the MLL gene and intron 3 of the AF4 gene. Recombination was
precise at the sequence level except for the overall gain of a single
templated nucleotide. The translocation breakpoints in MLL and AF4 were
DNA topoisomerase II cleavage sites. Etoposide and its metabolites, but
not dactinomycin, enhanced cleavage at these sites on in vitro
incubation. The findings were inconsistent with a translocation
mechanism involving interchromosomal recombination by simple exchange of
DNA topoisomerase II subunits and DNA-strand transfer. Etoposide and/or
its metabolites were considered the relevant exposures in this patient.

;;CBX;;
HP1, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, BETA;;
HP1-BETA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1) is localized at heterochromatin sites,
where it mediates gene silencing.

CLONING

Some autoimmune sera recognize antigens located near the centromere
(CENPA, 117139; CENPB, 117140; CENPC1, 117141) as well as
heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1). Using human autoimmune serum to screen
a HepG2 library, Furuta et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding CBX1, a
human homolog of Drosophila HP1, which the authors called HP1-beta. CBX1
encodes a 185-amino acid protein that has 66% sequence identity and 80%
similarity to CBX5 (604478). CBX1 is 100% identical to mouse M31 and to
human HSM1, which was identified by Singh et al. (1991). CBX1 has a
conserved 37-amino acid region called the chromodomain, or chromobox, in
the N-terminal region. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that only
antibodies directed against the C terminus of CBX1 showed nucleoplasmic
and heterochromatin staining. N-terminal-specific antibodies were
nonreactive. The C-terminal domain antibodies were also reactive with
the centromeric region during metaphase and anaphase and with whole
chromosomes during telophase.

GENE FUNCTION

Lachner et al. (2001) showed that mammalian methyltransferases that
selectively methylate histone H3 (see 602810) on lysine-9 (Suv39h
HMTases; see SUV39H1, 300254) generate a binding site for HP1 proteins,
a family of heterochromatic adaptor molecules implicated in both gene
silencing and supranucleosomal chromatin structure. High-affinity in
vitro recognition of a methylated histone H3 peptide by HP1 requires a
functional chromodomain; thus, the HP1 chromodomain is a specific
interaction motif for the methyl epitope on lysine-9 of histone H3. In
vivo, heterochromatin association of HP1 proteins is lost in Suv39h
double-null primary mouse fibroblasts but is restored after
reintroduction of a catalytically active SUV39H1 HMTase. Lachner et al.
(2001) concluded that their data define a molecular mechanism through
which the SUV39H-HP1 methylation system can contribute to the
propagation of heterochromatic subdomains in native chromatin.

Bannister et al. (2001) demonstrated that HP1 can bind with high
affinity to histone H3 methylated at lysine-9 but not at lysine-4. They
identified the chromodomain of HP1 as its methyl-lysine-binding domain.
A point mutation in the chromodomain, which destroys the gene silencing
activity of HP1 in Drosophila, abolished methyl-lysine-binding activity.
Genetic and biochemical analysis in S. pombe showed that the methylase
activity of Clr4 (the SUV39H1 homolog) is necessary for the correct
localization of Swi6 (the HP1 equivalent) at centromeric heterochromatin
and for gene silencing. Bannister et al. (2001) concluded that these
results provide a stepwise model for the formation of a
transcriptionally silent heterochromatin: SUV39H1 places a methyl marker
on histone H3, which is then recognized by HP1 through its chromodomain.
This model may also explain the stable inheritance of the
heterochromatic state.

Eukaryotic genomes are organized into discrete structural and functional
chromatin domains. Noma et al. (2001) demonstrated that distinct
site-specific histone H3 methylation patterns define euchromatic and
heterochromatic chromosomal domains within an 47-kb region of the mating
type locus in fission yeast. H3 methylated at lysine-9, and its
interacting Swi6 protein, are strictly localized to a 20-kb silent
heterochromatic interval. In contrast, H3 methylated at lysine-4 is
specific to the surrounding euchromatic regions. Two inverted repeats
flanking the silent interval serve as boundary elements to mark the
borders between heterochromatin and euchromatin. Deletions of these
boundary elements leads to spreading of H3 lys9 methylation and Swi6
into neighboring sequences. Furthermore, the H3 lys6 methylation and
corresponding heterochromatin-associated complexes prevent H3 lys4
methylation in the silent domain.

Festenstein et al. (2003) used fluorescence recovery after
photobleaching to demonstrate that a GFP-HP1-beta fusion protein is
highly mobile within both the euchromatin and heterochromatin of ex vivo
resting murine T cells. Moreover, T cell activation greatly increased
this mobility, indicating that such a process may facilitate
(hetero)chromatin remodeling and permit access of epigenetic modifiers
and transcription factors to the many genes that are consequently
derepressed.

Cheutin et al. (2003) demonstrated that maintenance of stable
heterochromatin domains in living cells involves the transient binding
and dynamic exchange of HP1 from chromatin. HP1 exchange kinetics
correlated with the condensation level of chromatin and were dependent
on the histone methyltransferase Suv39h (300254). The chromodomain and
the chromoshadow domain of HP1 are both required for binding to native
chromatin in vivo, but they contribute differentially to binding in
euchromatin and heterochromatin. Cheutin et al. (2003) suggested that
their data argue against HP1 repression of transcription by formation of
static, higher order oligomeric networks but support a dynamic
competition model, and demonstrate that heterochromatin is accessible to
regulatory factors.

Fischle et al. (2005) demonstrated that HP1-alpha (604478), HP1-beta,
and HP1-gamma (604477) are released from chromatin during the M phase of
the cell cycle even though trimethylation levels of histone H3 lys9
remain unchanged. However, the additional transient modification of
histone H3 by phosphorylation of ser10 next to the more stable
methyl-lys9 mark is sufficient to eject HP1 proteins from their binding
sites. Inhibition or depletion of the mitotic kinase Aurora B (604970),
which phosphorylates histone H3 on ser10, causes retention of HP1
proteins on mitotic chromosomes, suggesting that H3 ser10
phosphorylation is necessary for the dissociation of HP1 from chromatin
in M phase. Fischle et al. (2005) concluded that their findings
establish a regulatory mechanism of protein-protein interactions,
through a combinatorial readout of 2 adjacent posttranslational
modifications: a stable methylation and a dynamic phosphorylation mark.

Smallwood et al. (2007) demonstrated that DNMT1 (126375) could interact
with HP1-alpha, HP1-beta, and HP1-gamma in a human colon carcinoma cell
line, resulting in stimulation of DNMT1 methyltransferase activity. The
HP1 proteins were sufficient to target DNMT1 activity in vivo, and
HP1-dependent repression required DNMT1. Smallwood et al. (2007)
demonstrated that HP1-alpha and HP1-beta were recruited to the survivin
(BIRC5; 603352) promoter in a DNMT1-dependent manner. They concluded
that direct interactions between HP1 proteins and DNMT1 mediate
silencing of euchromatic genes.

Ayoub et al. (2008) identified a dynamic change in chromatin that
promotes H2AX (601772) phosphorylation in mammalian cells. DNA breaks
swiftly mobilized HP1-beta, a chromatin factor bound to histone H3
methylated on lysine-9 (H3K9me; see 601128). Local changes in histone
tail modifications were not apparent. Instead, phosphorylation of
HP1-beta on amino acid thr51 accompanied mobilization, releasing
HP1-beta from chromatin by disrupting hydrogen bonds that fold its
chromodomain around H3K9me. Inhibition of casein kinase-2 (CK2; see
115442), an enzyme implicated in DNA damage sensing and repair,
suppressed thr51 phosphorylation and HP1-beta mobilization in living
cells. CK2 inhibition, or a constitutively chromatin-bound HP1-beta
mutant, diminished H2AX phosphorylation. Ayoub et al. (2008) concluded
that their findings revealed a signaling cascade that helps to initiate
the DNA damage response, altering chromatin by modifying a histone code
mediator protein, HP1, but not the code itself.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Nielsen et al. (2002) showed that HP1 uses an induced-fit mechanism to
recognize the methylation of lys9, as revealed by the structure of its
chromodomain bound to a histone H3 peptide dimethylated at N-zeta of
lys9. The binding pocket for the N-methyl groups is provided by 3
aromatic side chains, tyr21, trp42, and phe45, which reside in 2 regions
that become ordered on binding of the peptide. The side chain of lys9 is
almost fully extended and surrounded by residues that are conserved in
many other chromodomains. The QTAR peptide sequence preceding lys9
performs most of the additional interactions with the chromodomain, with
HP1 residues val23, leu40, trp42, leu58, and cys60 appearing to be a
major determinant of specificity by binding the key buried ala7. Nielsen
et al. (2002) concluded that their findings predict which other
chromodomains will bind methylated proteins and suggest a motif that
they might recognize.

179490	TITLE *179490 RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB3A; RAB3A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The RAS gene superfamily is divided into 3 main branches according to
protein homology. In mammals the first branch includes the classic RAS
genes as well as RAL (179550) and RRAS (165090). The RHO genes (165370,
165380, 165390) belong to the second branch and the RAB genes to the
third. The RAB genes were so named because they were first isolated from
a rat brain library. Zahraoui et al. (1989) isolated cDNAs encoding
RAB3A and several other human RAB proteins. See RAB5A (179512). The
predicted 220-amino acid human RAB3A protein shares 99% and 78% identity
with rat Rab3A and human RAB3B (179510), respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Giovedi et al. (2004) found that interaction between mammalian synapsin
I (SYN1; 313440) and Rab3a regulated the activities of both proteins.
Synapsin I stimulated the Rab3a cycle by increasing GTP binding, GTPase
activity, and Rab3a recruitment to the synaptic vesicle membrane.
Conversely, Rab3a inhibited synapsin I binding to actin and synapsin
I-induced synaptic vesicle clustering.

Corticoamygdala long-term potentiation (LTP) and late-phase LTP at
hippocampal synapses are 2 forms of LTP that require both postsynaptic
NMDA receptor (see, e.g., 138249) activation and presynaptic protein
kinase A (PKA; see 176911) activation. By in vitro analysis of
transverse slices from the hippocampus and lateral amygdala of
Rab3a-null mice, Huang et al. (2005) found that Rab3a was necessary for
both forms of synaptic plasticity. Rim1-alpha (606629), a
Rab3a-interacting molecule, was also required for hippocampal late-phase
LTP. The findings indicated that presynaptic proteins also play a role
in plasticity that is dependent on postsynaptic activity, thus adding a
layer of complexity to synaptic interactions.

Ruediger et al. (2011) investigated how mossy fiber terminal complexes
at the entry of hippocampal and cerebellar circuits rearrange upon
learning in mice, and the functional role of the rearrangements.
Ruediger et al. (2011) showed that one-trial and incremental learning
lead to robust, circuit-specific, long-lasting, and reversible increases
in the numbers of filopodial synapses onto fast-spiking interneurons
that trigger feedforward inhibition. The increase in feedforward
inhibition connectivity involved a majority of the presynaptic
terminals, restricted the number of c-Fos (164810)-expressing
postsynaptic neurons at memory retrieval, and correlated temporally with
the quality of the memory. Ruediger et al. (2011) then showed that for
contextual fear conditioning and Morris water maze learning, increased
feedforward inhibition connectivity by hippocampal mossy fibers has a
critical role for the precision of the memory and the learned behavior.
In the absence of mossy fiber long-term potentiation in Rab3a-null mice,
c-Fos ensemble reorganization and feedforward inhibition growth were
both absent in CA3 upon learning, and the memory was imprecise. By
contrast, in the absence of adducin-2 (ADD2; 102681), c-Fos
reorganization was normal, but feedforward inhibition growth was
abolished. In parallel, c-Fos ensembles in CA3 were greatly enlarged,
and the memory was imprecise. Feedforward inhibition growth and memory
precision were both rescued by re-expression of Add2 specifically in
hippocampal mossy fibers. Ruediger et al. (2011) concluded that their
results established a causal relationship between learning-related
increases in the numbers of defined synapses and the precision of
learning and memory in the adult. The results further related plasticity
and feedforward inhibition growth at hippocampal mossy fibers to the
precision of hippocampus-dependent memories.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sullivan et al. (1999) found that the RAB3A gene consists of 5 exons
spanning 7.9 kb, and is located 3.7 kb from PDE4C (600128).

MAPPING

Rousseau-Merck et al. (1989, 1989) used the cloned human RAB3A cDNA as a
probe to map the corresponding gene by hybridization to flow sorted
chromosomes and by in situ hybridization. They concluded that RAB3A is
located on 19p13.2. The RAB genes may serve a regulatory function in the
developing nervous system. No oncogenic activity has been demonstrated
as yet for any of the RAB branch family genes. It is noteworthy,
however, that the 19p13.2 site is involved in malignant processes such
as acute leukemias. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Trask et al.
(1993) assigned the RAB3A gene to 19p13.1-p12.

ANIMAL MODEL

In brain, RAB3A is found specifically in synaptic vesicles. Geppert et
al. (1997) generated Rab3a-deficient mice. They found that the size of
the readily releasable pool of vesicles was normal, but that
calcium-triggered fusion was altered in the absence of Rab3a such that a
greater number of exocytic events occurred within a brief time after
arrival of the nerve impulse. They concluded that RAB3A regulates a late
step in synaptic vesicle fusion.

Kapfhamer et al. (2002) identified a semidominant mouse mutation called
'earlybird' (Ebd) that shortens the circadian period of locomotor
activity. Sequence analysis of Rab3a identified a point mutation in the
conserved amino acid (asp77 to gly) within the GTP-binding domain of the
Rab3a protein in earlybird mutants, resulting in significantly reduced
levels of Rab3a protein. Phenotypic assessment of earlybird mice and a
null allele of Rab3a revealed anomalies in circadian period and sleep
homeostasis, providing evidence that Rab3a-mediated synaptic
transmission is involved in these behaviors.

610626	TITLE *610626 PPAP2 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1B; PPAPDC1B
;;HTPAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Previous studies of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) suggested that
deletion of a region of human chromosome 8p contributes to HCC
metastasis. Using cDNA microarray analysis of chromosome 8 ESTs from HCC
cell lines to identify genes with downregulated expression in high
metastatic potential versus low metastatic potential cell lines,
followed by database analysis and RT-PCR, Wu et al. (2006) cloned
PPAPDC1B, which they called HTPAP. The 175-amino acid protein contains
an N-terminal transmembrane domain, an acid phosphatase homology region,
2 PKC phosphorylation sites, and a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site.
RT-PCR analysis of 16 metastatic HCC tissues paired with 16 primary HCC
tissues showed downregulation of PPAPDC1B expression in 11 of 16
metastatic lesions compared to primary HCC tissues, with 9 of 16
metastatic lesions showing significant downregulation of PPAPDC1B (P
less than 0.05).

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro matrigel assays, Wu et al. (2006) showed that
PPAPDC1B-transfected metastatic HCC cells showed significantly lower
invasion activity. Transfection and expression of PPAPDC1B in nude mice
bearing human HCC significantly decreased the incidence and degree of
pulmonary metastasis of HCC.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2006) mapped the PPAPDC1B gene
to chromosome 8p12.

609590	TITLE *609590 QUAKING, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; QKI
;;QK1;;
QK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

QKI belongs to a family of RNA-binding proteins that have an HNRNPK
(600712) homology (KH) domain embedded in a 200-amino acid region called
the GSG domain. Other members of this family include SAM68 (KHDRBS1;
602489) and SF1 (601516) (Chen and Richard, 1998). QKI proteins regulate
RNA splicing, export of target RNAs from the nucleus, translation of
proteins, and RNA stability (Lauriat et al., 2008).

CLONING

Ebersole et al. (1996) identified several splice variants of mouse Qki
that could be grouped into 2 classes based on size. The longer mRNAs (7,
6, and 5 kb) were abundant in mouse brain, whereas the shorter mRNAs
(1.5 to 1.9 kb) were less abundant. The longer variants encode deduced
proteins containing an N-terminal proline-rich domain, followed by 2 RG
boxes, a second proline-rich region, a central GSG/STAR domain, a third
proline-rich domain, and 5 tyrosines preceding alternative C-terminal
ends. The GSG domain consists of a KH domain flanked by evolutionarily
conserved quaking (QUA) domains 1 and 2. Qki also has 7 SH3-binding
sites dispersed throughout its sequence. Qki expression peaked in
16-day-old myelinating mouse brain. A splice variant was also detected
in newborn testis. In situ hybridization of normal mouse brain showed
Qki transcripts in myelinating tracts in the cerebellum. Ebersole et al.
(1996) identified multiple QKI transcripts in human, rodent, chicken,
and frog.

By Northern blot analysis, Hardy et al. (1996) found that the 5-, 6-,
and 7-kb Qki mRNAs, which they designated Qki-5, Qki-6, and Qki-7,
respectively, were variably expressed in developing and adult mouse
brain. Levels of Qki-5 declined dramatically after the second postnatal
week, whereas levels of Qki-6 and Qki-7 declined modestly thereafter.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected all 3 proteins in myelinating
cells of the central and peripheral nervous system and in astrocytes.
The isoforms showed distinct intracellular distributions, however, with
Qki-6 and Qki-7 localized to perikaryal cytoplasm and Qki-5 restricted
to nucleus.

Noveroske et al. (2002) found that Qki was expressed in the yolk sac
endoderm in mice, adjacent to developing blood islands.

Using quantitative RT-PCR, Lauriat et al. (2008) found that QKI-5 showed
no significant differences in expression across various age groups in
human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. However, QKI-5 was the
only QKI variant expressed at high levels in fetal PFC. QKI-6 expression
increased in PFC in a linear fashion with age, with a substantial
increase between 1 to 2 months and 1 to 2 years of age. In human
hippocampus, QKI-6 expression increased at 1 to 2 years of age, remained
high during childhood, and decreased in adulthood. QKI-7a generally
showed a linear trend toward increased expression in PFC with age, but
there was a peak at 1 to 2 years of age. QKI-7b expression in PFC did
not vary significantly with age due to greater variability between
individuals, but there was a trend toward an increase with age. In
hippocampus, QKI-7a and QKI-7b showed a trend toward decreased
expression in adulthood, similar to QKI-6, but there was greater
variability between individuals. Lauriat et al. (2008) noted that
expression of QKI-6 and QKI-7 in PFC increased during the period of
active myelination.

By sequencing mRNAs expressed in primary cultures of human astrocytes,
Radomska et al. (2013) identified QKI5, QKI6, QKI7, QKI7b, and a novel
variant that they called QKI6b. QKI6b differs from other QKI variants in
the 3-prime UTR and encodes a protein identical to that encoded by QKI6.
QKI6 and QKI6b were the most abundant QKI transcripts detected in human
astrocytes, and QKI5 was the least abundant. Immunohistochemical
analysis with isoform-specific antibodies revealed that QKI6 and QKI7
were uniformly distributed throughout the nucleus, cell body, and
processes, whereas QKI5 localized to nuclei and was excluded from
nucleoli. Western blot analysis detected QKI6 at an apparent molecular
mass of 38 kD. Both QKI5 and QKI7 had apparent molecular masses of about
40 kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Backx et al. (2010) noted that the QKI gene contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

Backx et al. (2010) stated that the QKI gene maps to chromosome 6q26.

The mouse Qki gene maps to chromosome 17 (Ebersole et al., 1996).

GENE FUNCTION

Chen and Richard (1998) showed that the mouse Qk1 proteins homodimerized
in vivo, and they determined that the GSG domain mediated dimerization
and RNA binding. Self-association was mediated by a region of QUA1
predicted to form coiled coils.

Larocque et al. (2002) found that mouse Qk1 proteins bound a short
element in the 3-prime UTR of Mbp (159430). The balance between the
nuclear and cytoplasmic isoforms of Qk1 controlled the nuclear export of
Mbp mRNAs and the cellular localization of the 17- and 21.5-kD Mbp
isoforms. Overexpression of Qki-5 in cultured rodent oligodendrocytes
recreated the Mbp defects observed in qk(v) mice, with retention of Mbp
in the nucleus. Larocque et al. (2002) concluded that the QKI proteins
have a role in myelination.

In an mRNA analysis of 55 control human brains, Aberg et al. (2006)
found that QKI mRNA levels accounted for 47% of the coordinated
variation of mRNA levels of 6 oligodendrocyte-related genes, PLP1
(300401), MAG (159460), MBP, TF (190000), SOX10 (602229), and CDKN1B
(600778). In silico analysis identified potential QKI-binding sites in
all of the genes except TF. Variation in the relative expression of
splice variant QKI-7 explained a large fraction of additional mRNA
variation in 3 highly coexpressed genes, MAG, PLP1, and TF. Analysis of
55 brains from patients with schizophrenia (see 181500) showed
significantly decreased expression of MAG, PLP1, and TF compared to
control brains that was associated with decreased levels of QKI-7. Aberg
et al. (2006) concluded that QKI is a regulator of oligodendrocyte
differentiation and maturation in the human brain, and suggested that
splice variants of QKI may play a role in myelin and oligodendrocyte
dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Using yeast 2-hybrid screens, coaffinity purification analysis of
transfected HEK293 cells, and bioinformatic analysis, Lim et al. (2006)
developed an interaction network for 54 human proteins involved in 23
inherited ataxias. By database analysis, they expanded the core network
to include more distantly related interacting proteins that could
function as genetic modifiers. RBPMS (601558) was a main hub in the
network and interacted with many proteins, including the cerebellar
ataxia-associated proteins ATN1 (607462) and QK1.

Using a rat cell line and primary mixed glial cultures from neonatal rat
brain, Chen et al. (2007) showed that Qk1 was necessary and sufficient
for oligodendroglia progenitor cell differentiation. Qk1 isoforms 5, 6,
and 7 differed in their ability to promote oligodendroglia
differentiation, which was dependent on the RNA-binding ability of Qk1.
RNA interference-mediated Qk1 knockdown abrogated differentiation
without affecting proliferation capacity or cell cycle progression.

Using qualitative RT-PCR, Lauriat et al. (2008) examined expression of
putative QKI target mRNAs, including MAGI1 (602625), BCAS1 (602968),
CDKN1B, PLP1, and MAG, in human prefrontal cortex and hippocampus from
fetus to adulthood (up to 46 years of age). Most of the putative QKI
target mRNAs showed increased expression with increasing age in
prefrontal cortex. However, there was little evidence of developmental
regulation of these mRNAs in hippocampus.

Using small interfering RNA, Radomska et al. (2013) found that knockdown
of QKI7 in cultured human astrocytes reduced expression of an astrocyte
differentiation marker, GFAP (137780), but did not reduce cell
viability. The dominant GFAP variant expressed in the astrocytes,
GFAP-alpha, was the most highly downregulated. Radomska et al. (2013)
identified a core QKI regulatory element (QRE) in the 3-prime UTR of the
GFAP-alpha transcript and a potential upstream half-site. The QRE, but
not the half-site, was conserved in mouse Gfap. Exposure of astrocytes
to the antipsychotic drug haloperidol specifically increased expression
of QKI7 and GFAP transcripts.

CYTOGENETICS

Backx et al. (2010) reported a woman with borderline mental retardation
and dysmorphic features who had a de novo reciprocal balanced
translocation t(5;6)(q23.1;q26) disrupting the QKI gene. The 5q
breakpoint occurred in a gene desert. RNA studies showed a 50% reduction
in QKI expression, consistent with haploinsufficiency. She presented at
birth with hypotonia, short neck, genital hypoplasia with underdeveloped
labia majora, and facial dysmorphism including epicanthal folds, narrow
palpebral fissures, broad nasal bridge with small nose and bulbous tip,
small mouth with downturned corners, a long philtrum, and small
protruding cupped ears. She attended special education schools.
Evaluation at age 23 years showed relative microcephaly,
microretrognathia, small mouth with high-arched palate, myopia, and
nasal speech. She also had inverted nipples and irregular menses.
Seizures and brain anomalies were not present.

Backx et al. (2010) provided a literature review of 18 patients reported
with chromosome 6qter deletions and 2 patients reported with
interstitial 6q deletion. All deletions included the QKI gene. They
noted that while the deletion sizes varied a common recognizable
phenotype of intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, seizures, brain
anomalies, and specific dysmorphic facial features could be distilled
for the chromosome 6qter deletion syndrome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Recessive mutations in the mouse quaking gene affect myelination and
embryogenesis and can be embryonic lethal. A spontaneous, recessive
quaking mutation, qk(v), results in viable mice with a severe deficit in
myelin, leading to rapid tremor by postnatal day 10. By Northern blot
analysis, Ebersole et al. (1996) detected a truncated Qki message in
brains of qk(v) mice.

Hardy et al. (1996) found that Qki-6 and Qki-7 were absent from
myelin-forming cells in qk(v) mice. Qki-5 was absent only from
oligodendrocytes of tracts from severely affected qk(v) brain regions.

Wu et al. (2002) found misregulated alternative splicing of several
myelin genes in qk(v) mice.

Lu et al. (2003) presented evidence that the qk(v) mutation affects an
enhancer required for expression of Qki in myelinating cells but not in
other tissues.

Chen and Richard (1998) determined that a point mutation within the QUA1
region of Qk1 caused embryonic lethality in mice. The mutation abolished
Qk1 self-association but had no effect on RNA-binding activity.
Expression of wildtype Qk1 or a lethal mutant Qk1 deficient in
self-association but not RNA binding induced cell death by apoptosis in
a mouse fibroblast cell line. The lethal Qk1 mutant was more potent at
inducing apoptosis.

Noveroske et al. (2002) found that embryonic mice with a lethal point
mutation in Qki had defective yolk sac vascular remodeling and abnormal
vessels in the embryo proper at midgestation, coinciding with embryonic
death.

Noveroske et al. (2005) isolated qk(e5), an N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea-induced
viable allele of mouse Qki. Unlike qk(v)/qk(v) mice, qk(e5)/qk(e5) mice
had early-onset seizures, severe ataxia, and a dramatically reduced life
span. Ultrastructural analysis of qk(e5)/qk(e5) brains revealed severe
dysmyelination when compared with both wildtype and qk(v)/qk(v) brains.
Young adult qk(e5)/qk(e5) mice exhibited Purkinje cell axonal swellings
indicative of neurodegeneration, which is not seen in young adult
qk(v)/qk(v) mice. The molecular defect in the qk(e5) allele was not
evident, but protein expression studies showed that qk(e5)/qk(e5)
postnatal oligodendrocytes lacked Qki-6 and Qki-7 and had reduced Qki-5
levels. Several oligodendrocyte developmental markers were present in
qk(e5)/qk(e5) postnatal brain, but Cnp (123830) and Mbp levels were
considerably reduced. Noveroske et al. (2005) noted that qk(v) is a
large deletion that affects expression of Pacrg (608427) and Parkin
(PARK2; 602544) in addition to Qki, complicating interpretation of its
neuropathology. Thus, they suggested that qk(e5) may be useful in
studying QKI regulation in the developing central nervous system and its
role in myelination.

Wilson et al. (2010) noted that the qk(v) phenotype, which includes
dysmyelination of the central nervous system and male sterility, is due
to reduced expression of Qk and a complete lack of Pacrg expression,
respectively. Since Pacrg is required for correct development of the
spermatozoan flagella (a specialized type of motile cilia), Wilson et
al. (2010) analyzed qk(v) mutant mice for evidence of cilial
dysfunction. Histologic and magnetic resonance imaging analyses
demonstrated that qk(v) mutant mice were affected by acquired,
communicating hydrocephalus (HC). Structure of axonemal microtubules and
density of ciliated cells were normal, and cilia length was similar to
wildtype littermates. There was a reduction in ependymal cilial beat
frequency and cilial-mediated flow in qk(v) mutant mice compared with
wildtype littermate controls. Transgenic expression of Pacrg was
necessary and sufficient to correct this deficit and rescue the HC
phenotype in the qk(v) mutant. Wilson et al. (2010) concluded that Pacrg
is required for motile cilia function and may be involved in the
pathogenesis of human ciliopathies, such as HC, asthenospermia, and
primary ciliary dyskinesia.
