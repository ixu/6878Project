DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Apolipoprotein B (APOB; 107730) mRNA editing is an intranuclear function
and is mediated by a multiprotein editosome complex (see APOBEC1;
600130). Using the yeast 2-hybrid system, Lau et al. (1997) identified
an APOBEC1-binding protein (ABBP1) that interacts with APOB mRNA. The
ABBP1 cDNA encodes a 331-amino acid protein that is identical to the
human type A/B heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) reported
by Khan et al. (1991), except for a 47-residue insertion in its
C-terminal region. Khan et al. (1991) identified the type A/B hnRNP as
an RNA-binding protein of unknown function in HeLa cells. Northern blot
analysis indicated that ABBP1 mRNA is distributed in multiple human
tissues as an approximately 2-kb transcript. The 47-amino acid insertion
of ABBP1 is encoded by an alternatively spliced exon.

GENE FUNCTION

Lau et al. (1997) found that ABBP1 contains typical RNP-type RNA-binding
motifs in its N-terminal half and glycine-rich motifs, which house the
APOBEC1-binding region, in its C-terminal region. ABBP1 binds to APOB
mRNA transcripts around the editing site and can be UV-crosslinked to
them. Editing is inhibited by ABBP1 immunodepletion or antisense ABBP1
cDNA transfection.

;;EPH-RELATED RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASE LIGAND 8; EPLG8;;
LIGAND OF EPH-RELATED KINASE 8; LERK8;;
EFL6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the ephrin family are ligands for EPH-related receptor
tyrosine kinases and are attached to the cell membrane by either a
glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage or a single transmembrane domain.
See 179610 for additional information on ephrins and the Eph receptor
family.

CLONING

Tang et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding ephrin-B3 (EFNB3), named
LERK8 by them, by screening a human fetal brain cDNA library using mouse
Efnb1 cDNA as a probe. The EFNB3 protein contains a predicted
transmembrane region, and its 340-amino acid sequence shares 38% and 40%
identity with those of the transmembrane ephrins EFNB1 (300035) and
EFNB2 (600527), respectively. Since the N-terminal halves of EFNB1,
EFNB2, and EFNB3 are especially conserved, Tang et al. (1997) suggested
that these proteins bind the same subclass of EPH-related receptor
tyrosine kinases. In addition, a C-terminal region containing 5
conserved tyrosine residues is strikingly similar among these ephrins,
and the authors speculated that this region may function in signal
transduction. Using Northern blot analysis, Tang et al. (1997) found
that the EFNB3 gene is expressed as a major 3.5-kb transcript. In the
midterm fetus, the highest EFNB3 mRNA level is in brain, followed by
heart, kidney, and lung; expression in the adult is restricted to brain
and is particularly high in forebrain subregions. Tang et al. (1997)
suggested that EFNB3 is important in both brain development and
maintenance and that it may play a pivotal role in forebrain function.

GENE FUNCTION

Palmer et al. (2002) showed that SRC family kinases, or SFKs (see SRC;
190090), are positive regulators of ephrin-B phosphorylation and
phosphotyrosine-mediated reverse signaling. EphB receptor engagement of
ephrin-B caused rapid recruitment of SFKs to ephrin-B expression domains
and transient SFK activation. With delayed kinetics, ephrin-B ligands
recruited the cytoplasmic PDZ domain-containing protein tyrosine
phosphatase PTPBL (see 600267) and were dephosphorylated. These data
suggested the presence of a switch mechanism that allows a shift from
phosphotyrosine-/SFK-dependent signaling to PDZ-dependent signaling.

Local circuits in the spinal cord that generate locomotion are termed
central pattern generators. These provide coordinated bilateral control
over the normal limb alternation that underlies walking. Isolated spinal
cords from mice lacking either the EphA4 receptor (602188) or its ligand
ephrin B3 have lost left-right limb alternation and instead exhibit
synchrony. Kullander et al. (2003) identified EphA4-positive neurons as
an excitatory component of the locomotor central pattern generator.
Kullander et al. (2003) concluded that dramatic locomotor changes can
occur as a consequence of local genetic rewiring and identified genes
required for the development of normal locomotor behavior.

In mouse hippocampal neurons, Grunwald et al. (2004) showed that ephrin
B2 and B3 are predominantly located postsynaptically and are required
for synaptic plasticity, including both long-term potentiation and
long-term depression. The EphA4 receptor is also critically involved in
long-term plasticity independent of its cytoplasmic domain, suggesting
that the ephrin B proteins are the active signaling partner. Grunwald et
al. (2004) suggested that ephrins can be used in converse manners,
depending on the synaptic site.

MAPPING

Tang et al. (1997) mapped the EFNB3 gene to chromosome 17 by PCR
screening of somatic cell hybrid DNAs. They refined the localization to
17p13.1-p11.2 by PCR screening of a chromosome 17 regional mapping
panel.

;;SUN DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1;;
UNC84, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, A; UNC84A;;
KIAA0810
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SUN1 and SUN2 (613569) are inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins that
play a major role in nuclear-cytoplasmic connection by formation of a
'bridge' across the nuclear envelope, known as the LINC complex, via
interaction with the conserved luminal KASH domain of nesprins (e.g.,
SYNE1; 608441) located in the outer nuclear membrane (ONM). The LINC
complex provides a direct connection between the nuclear lamina and the
cytoskeleton, which contributes to nuclear positioning and cellular
rigidity (summary by Haque et al., 2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned UNC84A, which they called KIAA0810.
The deduced protein contains 824 amino acids. UNC84A shares about 32%
identity over 191 amino acids with Sad1 of Saccharomyces pombe. RT-PCR
ELISA revealed weak to moderate expression in most tissues examined.
Highest expression was detected in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and
ovary, and weakest expression was detected in spleen.

By searching databases for homologs of C. elegans Unc84, followed by
5-prime RACE of a brain cDNA library, Malone et al. (1999) cloned human
SUN1 and SUN2. The predicted proteins contain 824 and 724 amino acids,
respectively, and their C termini share homology with the C termini of
C. elegans Unc84 and S. pombe Sad1. Both SUN1 and SUN2 contain a
transmembrane region.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with Trax (602964) as bait, Bray et al.
(2002) cloned Unc84a, which they designated Sun1, from a mouse testis
cDNA library. The deduced protein contains 310 amino acids. Overall the
mouse and human proteins share 75% homology, and they share 89% homology
in the C-terminal Sad1/Unc84 (SUN) domain. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected a 4.3-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with
highest levels in heart, brain, and testis, and a 2.5-kb transcript only
in testis. Northern blot analysis of isolated testicular germ cells
detected the 4.3-kb transcript in pachytene spermatocytes and the 2.5-kb
transcript primarily in postmeiotic cells. Unc84a transfected into
NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts showed 2 patterns of distribution. One pattern
was predominantly cytoplasmic with perinuclear accumulation, and the
other exhibited both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining, but no
accumulation in the nucleoli. Bray et al. (2002) noted that these
expression profiles may reflect regulation of expression during the cell
cycle, since the transfected cells were not synchronized.

By peptide mass fingerprint spectra, Dreger et al. (2001) identified
Unc84a in a TX100-resistant fraction of nuclear envelope proteins
isolated from a mouse neuroblastoma cell line. Mouse Unc84a contains a
C2H2 zinc finger domain and 3 to 4 putative transmembrane segments. The
apparent molecular mass of mouse Unc84a is about 100 kD. Indirect
immunofluorescence of transiently transfected COS-7 cells detected
Unc84a fluorescence in a rim-like pattern around the nucleus, typical
for integral inner nuclear membrane proteins.

By immunofluorescence analysis, Ding et al. (2007) found that the
distribution of Sun1 changed during development of mouse spermatids. In
primary spermatocytes, but not in round spermatids, Sun1 colocalized
with telomeres. Sun1 associated with chromosome ends from early
leptotene stage to diplotene stage, including homolog pairing, synapsis,
and desynapsis, but it was absent from telomeres during diakinesis.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and in vitro binding assays, Bray et al.
(2002) determined that the C terminus of Unc84a interacts directly with
Trax.

Haque et al. (2010) stated that SUN1 and SUN2 interact with lamin A
(LMNA; 150330) and that LMNA is required for the nuclear envelope
localization of SUN2, but not SUN1. By immunoprecipitation of
transfected human osteosarcoma cells and mouse fibroblasts, followed by
in vitro pull-down assays and immunofluorescence microscopy, Haque et
al. (2010) identified emerin (EMD; 300384) and short isoforms of
nesprin-2 (SYNE2; 608442) as novel nucleoplasmic binding partners of
mouse Sun1 and human SUN2. Emerin and nesprin-2 had overlapping binding
sites, distinct from the LMNA-binding site, in Sun1 and SUN2. LMNA
mutations associated with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy-2 (EDMD2;
181350) and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS; 176670)
disrupted interaction of LMNA with Sun1 and SUN2. Nuclear localization
of SUN1 and SUN2 was not impaired in EDMD2 or HGPS cell lines.
Expression of SUN1, but not SUN2, at the nuclear envelope was enhanced
in some HGPS cells, likely due to increased interaction of SUN1 with
accumulated prelamin A. Haque et al. (2010) proposed that different
perturbations in LMNA-SUN protein interactions may underlie the opposing
effects of EDMD and HGPS mutations on nuclear and cellular mechanics.

Chen et al. (2012) showed that cells from Lmna -/- mice, which represent
EDMD2, cells from Lmna(L530P/L530P) mice, which represent HGPS, and
cells from HGPS patients all had overaccumulation of the inner nuclear
envelope SUN1 protein. In wildtype cells, Lmna and Sun1 colocalized at
the nuclear envelope. In Lmna -/- cells, larger amounts of Sun1 were
found at the nuclear envelope and also in the Golgi. The larger amounts
of Sun1 appeared to result from reduced protein turnover. Transfection
of increasing amounts of mouse Sun1 into Lmna-null/Sun1-null murine
cells resulted in increased prevalence of nuclear herniations and
apoptosis, and the herniations appeared to result from Sun1 accumulation
in the Golgi. Loss of the Sun1 gene in both mouse models extensively
rescued cellular, tissue, organ, and lifespan abnormalities. Similarly,
knockdown of overaccumulated SUN1 protein in primary human HGPS cells
corrected nuclear defects and cellular senescence. The findings
indicated that accumulation of SUN1 is a common pathogenetic event in
these disorders.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the UNC84A
gene to chromosome 7.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ding et al. (2007) obtained Sun1-null mouse embryos in the expected
mendelian ratio. Both male and female Sun1-null mice developed normally,
but they were sterile. Histologic examination showed that germ cells
were largely depleted in seminiferous tubules of Sun1-null mice.
Spermatids and spermatozoa were completely absent, and only abnormal
spermatocyte-like cells accumulated in some tubules. TUNEL staining
revealed that massive apoptosis accounted for the absence of spermatids
and spermatozoa in Sun1-null testis.

Lei et al. (2009) found that anchorage of skeletal muscle nuclei at
neuromuscular junctions was partially disrupted in Sun1-null mice, but
not in Sun2-null mice. Anchorage of nonsynaptic nuclei was normal in
both Sun1-null mice and Sun2-null mice. Sun1/Sun2 double-knockout mice
died soon after birth, with enhanced loss of synaptic nuclei, disrupted
organization of nonsynaptic nuclei, and mislocalization of Syne1 at
synaptic junctions. Disruption of 3 or all 4 wildtype Sun1 and Sun2
alleles revealed a gene dosage effect on synaptic nuclear anchorage. Lei
et al. (2009) concluded that SUN1 and SUN2 have partially redundant
functions on synaptic nuclear anchorage in skeletal muscle fibers.

Zhang et al. (2009) showed that Sun1 and Sun2 double-knockout (Sun1/2
DKO) mice and Syne1 and Syne2 double-knockout (Syne1/2 DKO) mice had
similar defects in brain development. Sun1/2 DKO and Syne1/2 DKO brains
were small and showed defective laminary structures in many brain
regions. Examination of neocortex revealed failure of radial neuronal
migration, but not tangential migration of interneurons, in both Sun1/2
DKO and Syne1/2 DKO mice. Intracellular movement of nuclei is a
prerequisite for proper neuron migration and development, and Zhang et
al. (2009) found that Sun1 and Sun2 anchored Syne2 to the nuclear
envelope, while Syne1 and Syne2 connected the nuclear envelope to the
microtubule network, permitting nuclear movement. Zhang et al. (2009)
concluded that a complex made up of SUN1, SUN2, SYNE1, and SYNE2 is
required for neuronal nuclear movement and for neuronal migration and
development.

182205	TITLE *182205 SEX HORMONE-BINDING GLOBULIN; SHBG
;;ANDROGEN-BINDING PROTEIN; ABP;;
TESTOSTERONE-BINDING BETA-GLOBULIN; TEBG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a previously characterized liver cDNA as a probe, Gershagen et al.
(1989) isolated a liver-secreted plasma glycoprotein that binds sex
steroids. Screening of a human testis cDNA library resulted in the
isolation of 2 distinct cDNA forms. One was identical to the previously
characterized liver SHBG cDNA, thus suggesting that human SHBG and the
androgen-binding protein (ABP) produced by Sertoli cells are encoded by
the same gene. The second cDNA differed from the first by having exon 1
exchanged with a completely different sequence and exon 7 deleted.
Primer extension experiments showed that the alternatively spliced
transcript corresponding to the second cDNA is present in both liver and
testis. From the primary structure of the putative SHBG-gene-related
protein, Gershagen et al. (1989) deduced that the protein is very
different from SHBG and probably without steroid-binding activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

By Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA, Gershagen et al. (1989) found
evidence indicating that only 1 SHBG is present in the human haploid
genome. The gene has 8 exons.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Berube et al. (1990) localized the SHBG gene
to chromosome 17p13-p12. By the study of intersubspecies backcrosses,
Joseph et al. (1991) found that Shbg is located on mouse chromosome 11
in close linkage to several neurologic mutations, one of which, Tr, is
associated with male sterility. The fact that ABP-SHBG is found
throughout the rat brain suggested that these mutations may represent a
defect in Shbg.

GENE FUNCTION

Testosterone in plasma is present in both bound and unbound form; only
the unbound hormone is biologically active and available to tissues.
About 66% of testosterone is bound to testosterone-binding beta-globulin
(TEBG), 31% to albumin, and 1.5% to transcortin; 2% is unbound. The
regulatory function of TEBG is said to be well illustrated by female
hirsutism; although many hirsute women have normal levels of total
plasma testosterone, nearly all have depressed levels of TEBG, resulting
in increased levels of unbound testosterone (Wenn et al., 1977; Raj et
al., 1978).

In mice expressing an 11-kb human SHBG transgene and in HepG2
hepatoblastoma cells, Selva et al. (2007) demonstrated that the
monosaccharides glucose and fructose reduced human SHBG production by
hepatocytes, irrespective of the presence of insulin, by downregulation
of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4A (HNF4A; 600281) and replacement of HNF4A
by COUP-TFI (NR2F1; 132890) at a cis-element within the human SHBG
promoter, coincident with repression of its transcriptional activity.
Dose-dependent reduction of HNF4A in HepG2 cells occurred in concert
with parallel increases in cellular palmitate levels and could be
mimicked by treatment with palmitoyl-CoA; inhibition of lipogenesis
prevented monosaccharide-induced downregulation of HNF4A and reduced
SHBG expression in HepG2 cells. Selva et al. (2007) concluded that
monosaccharide-induced lipogenesis reduces hepatic HNF4A levels, which
in turn attenuates SHBG expression, and noted that this provides a
biologic explanation for the sensitivity of SHBG as a biomarker of the
metabolic syndrome.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Cavalli-Sforza et al. (1977) developed an ingenious method for detection
of genetic variation in plasma proteins, namely, electrophoretic
screening after treatment with radioactive ligands such as vitamins,
hormones, metal ions and drugs. This is essentially a method of
'staining' the protein comparable to the methods using dyes. With this
approach they identified polymorphism of testosterone-binding
beta-globulin, as well as a possible silent allele. By polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (PAGE), Luckock and Cavalli-Sforza (1983) identified
4 electrophoretic variants, which they suggested result from
combinations of 3 alleles, designated N ('normal'), S ('slow'), and O
('absent'). The first 2 are codominant and the third recessive. The
frequencies of the 3 alleles in white Americans were, respectively,
0.68, 0.11, 0.21; in black Americans, 0.65, 0.14, 0.22; in Japanese
Americans, 0.59, 0.09, 0.32. Phenotype frequencies and segregation from
various crosses supported simple mendelian inheritance of an autosomal
gene.

By investigating neuraminidase-treated serum samples using isoelectric
focusing (IEF) followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and
immunostaining, van Baelen et al. (1992) distinguished 3 patterns
consistent with the expression of a biallelic autosomal system. They
published data on allele frequencies in many populations and found
frequencies of the common allele (SHBG*1) varying from 0.848 in Chinese
to 0.985 in Balinese; monomorphism was found only in Australian
Aborigines, all 47 of whom were SHBG*1 homozygotes. Van Baelen et al.
(1992) found no significant difference for allele frequencies among
hirsute Belgian women. They also presented evidence that the subunit
produced by the SHBG*2 allele has a higher molecular mass than the one
produced by the SHBG*1 allele and that the 3 SHBG genotypes have
identical binding characteristics for 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Power et al. (1992) demonstrated in a Belgian patient homozygous for a
variant isoelectric focusing pattern that a point mutation was present
in exon 8, creating an additional site for N-linked glycosylation.
Expression studies showed that steroid binding was not affected. Hardy
et al. (1995) found the same mutation in Mexican subjects who were
heterozygous for the variant IEF phenotype. Denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to localize the mutation in these
subjects and to purify the variant allele for DNA sequence analysis. A
GAC-to-AAC transition in codon 327 caused an asp-to-asn substitution in
the protein (D327N). The site of the mutation does not lie within the
predicted steroid-binding site of the molecule. The finding in these
widely separated populations suggested that the SHBG gene is biallelic
worldwide. The polymorphism was not associated with any pathologic
condition.

Xita et al. (2003) investigated the possible association of the
functional (TAAAA)n polymorphism in the promoter of the SHBG gene
(Hogeveen et al., 2001) with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS; 184700)
and SHBG levels. They studied 185 women with PCOS and 324 normal
controls. Genotyping revealed 6 (TAAAA)n alleles containing 6 to 11
repeats. The distribution of these alleles was different in the 2
groups. Women with PCOS had a significantly greater frequency of longer
(TAAAA)n alleles (more than 8 repeats) than normal women who had shorter
alleles (fewer than 8 repeats) in higher frequency (P = 0.001). In the
PCOS group, carriers of the longer allele genotypes had lower SHBG
levels than those with shorter alleles. The authors concluded that SHBG
may be a susceptibility gene for PCOS and may provide the genetic link
for the developmental origin hypothesis for PCOS that was proposed on
the basis of experimental observations in prenatally androgenized sheep
and primates (Abbott et al., 2002).

In a population of 303 women referred for hirsutism, Cousin et al.
(2004) investigated the relationship between the D327N mutation in SHBG
exon 8, the pentanucleotide repeat polymorphism (TAAAA)n in the SHBG
5-prime untranslated region, and SHBG levels. The D327N mutant allele
was associated with higher SHBG levels than was the wildtype.
Multivariate analysis showed that BMI, PCOS status, and D327N
polymorphism influenced plasma SHBG concentrations, each of these
parameters contributing independently of the others. A strong
disequilibrium linkage was found between the D327N variant allele and an
allele with 8 TAAAA repeats (P less than 0.0001). The authors suggested
that this linkage disequilibrium could mask the effect of the TAAAA
repeat polymorphism on SHBG concentration in vivo. Nevertheless, SHBG
levels in patients who were homozygous for 6 repeats were significantly
(P = 0.043) higher than in 9-repeat homozygous patients and lay between
the two for 8-repeat homozygous patients. Results supported the notion
that polymorphism within the coding sequence and, potentially, in the
regulatory sequence of the SHBG gene is associated with circulating SHBG
levels and may represent part of the genetic background of sex steroid
hormone activity in humans.

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the SHBG
gene and type 2 diabetes, see 125853.

- SHBG Circulating Level Quantitative Trait Locus

Eriksson et al. (2006) studied whether either of 2 polymorphisms in the
SHBG gene promoter, a (TAAAA)n microsatellite and the SNP dbSNP
rs1799941, are associated with serum levels of SHBG (613498), sex
steroids, or bone mineral density (BMD) in men. In both cohorts,
(TAAAA)n and dbSNP rs1799941 genotypes were associated with serum levels
of SHBG (P less than 0.001), dihydrotestosterone (P less than 0.05), and
5-alpha-androstane-3-alpha,17-beta-diol glucuronides (P less than 0.05).
In the elderly men, they were also associated with testosterone and BMD
at all hip bone sites. Eriksson et al. (2006) concluded that
polymorphisms in the SHBG promoter predict serum levels of SHBG,
androgens, and glucuronidated androgen metabolites, and hip BMD in men.

In the NCI-Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium using 874 SNPs
in 37 candidate genes in the sex steroid hormone pathway, Ahn et al.
(2009) identified a G-A variant (dbSNP rs1799941) located 67 bp upstream
from the transcription start site of the SHBG gene associated with
increased mean circulating levels of SHBG in 4,720 Caucasian men (p =
4.52 x 10(-21); 26.9% increase in AA homozygotes versus wildtype
homozygotes). The relationship between dbSNP rs1799941 was consistent
across the 5 cohorts in the study, age, BMI, and case-control status.
Additionally, dbSNP rs1799941 was also strongly associated with
increased mean circulating levels of testosterone in 4,678 Caucasian men
(p = 7.54 x 10(-15); 14.3% increase in AA homozygotes versus wildtype
homozygotes). Since clearance and bioavailability of testosterone are
related to SHBG levels, Ahn et al. (2009) used regression analysis to
show that also tended to predict SHBG adjusted-testosterone levels (p =
1.33 x 10(-3)).

HISTORY

Gross and Horton (1971) presented evidence indicating 'dominant'
segregation of the trait and low testosterone-binding protein, and
suggested Y-linkage. Hecht and Kimberling (1971) pointed out that since
the Y chromosome represents only about 2% of the human male haploid
genome, Bayesian correction of the estimate of Y-linkage reduces the
value to 1 in 3.

CD71
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

A monoclonal antibody, OKT-9, recognizes an antigen ubiquitously
distributed on the cell surface of actively growing human cells. It is a
glycoprotein composed of disulfide-linked polypeptide chains, each of
90,000 daltons molecular weight. Immunoprecipitation of the OKT-9
antigen in the presence of labeled transferrin results in specific
precipitation of transferrin (Sutherland et al., 1981); thus, the OKT-9
antigen is presumably transferrin receptor. Nikinmaa and Schroder (1987)
concluded that p90 and TFRC are the same protein: studies using
monoclonal antibodies indicated that exhaustive precipitation of
radioactively labeled lysates with one antibody removed all activity of
lysates with the other. Peptide maps of antigens recognized with both
antibodies showed great similarity and indicated that both antibodies
react with the same antigen, the human transferrin receptor, but with
different antigenic sites of the molecule.

GENE FUNCTION

Casey et al. (1988) analyzed the regulation by iron of the TFRC gene by
examining mouse cells transformed with chimeric constructs containing
the human transferrin receptor gene's promoter and either the structural
gene for bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or the human TFRC
cDNA. They concluded that at least 2 genetic elements, one 5-prime and
one 3-prime to the gene, are involved in the regulation of the TFRC gene
by iron.

Radoshitzky et al. (2007) demonstrated a specific high-affinity
association between TFR1 and the entry glycoprotein of Machupo virus (a
New World arenavirus). Expression of human TFR1, but not human TFR2
(604720), in hamster cell lines markedly enhanced the infection of
viruses pseudotyped with the glycoprotein of Machupo, Guanarito, and
Junin viruses, but not with those of Lassa or lymphocytic
choriomeningitis viruses. An anti-TFR1 antibody efficiently inhibited
the replication of Machupo, Guanarito, Junin, and Sabia viruses, but not
that of Lassa virus. Iron depletion of culture medium enhanced, and iron
supplementation decreased, the efficiency of infection by Junin and
Machupo but not Lassa pseudoviruses. Radoshitzky et al. (2007) concluded
that TFR1 is a cellular receptor for New World hemorrhagic fever
arenaviruses.

Ishii et al. (2009) found that knockdown of Ppargc1b (608886) in primary
mouse osteoclasts impaired their differentiation and mitochondrial
biogenesis. Transferrin receptor expression was induced in osteoclasts
via iron regulatory protein-2 (IREB2; 147582), and Tfrc-mediated iron
uptake promoted osteoclast differentiation and bone-resorbing activity,
which was associated with the induction of mitochondrial respiration,
production of reactive oxygen species, and accelerated Ppargc1b
transcription. Iron chelation inhibited osteoclastic bone resorption and
protected female mice against bone loss following estrogen deficiency
resulting from ovariectomy. Ishii et al. (2009) concluded that
mitochondrial biogenesis, which is induced by PPARGC1B and supported by
TFRC-mediated iron uptake for utilization by mitochondrial respiratory
proteins, is fundamental to osteoclast activation and bone metabolism.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid studies, Goodfellow et al. (1982) assigned the
TFR locus to chromosome 3. Miller et al. (1983) confirmed the assignment
to chromosome 3, specifically 3q22-qter. By in situ hybridization, Rabin
et al. (1985) narrowed the assignment to 3q26.2-qter. Adriaansen et al.
(1990) confirmed the assignment to chromosome 3 by study of somatic cell
hybrids. Using linkage analysis, somatic cell hybrid and radiation
hybrid mapping panels, and fluorescence in situ hybridization, Kashuba
et al. (1997) refined the localization of the TFRC gene to 3q29.

Valenzuela et al. (1991) found highly significant association between Rh
(111700) phenotypes and total iron binding capacity, i.e., transferrin.
Children with the C Rh specificity had higher values than non-C or c
individuals. Valenzuela et al. (1991) suggested that this finding may be
significant in relation to maintenance of the Rh polymorphism and
fetomaternal incompatibility.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Athletes such as racing cyclists sometimes use erythropoietin, which has
been officially included in the International Olympic Committee list of
banned substances since 1990, as a booster drug. Gareau et al. (1994)
presented evidence that the level of transferrin receptor in the blood
can be used as a means of detecting Epo misuse.

ANIMAL MODEL

Levy et al. (1999) disrupted the transferrin receptor gene, which they
termed Trfr, in mice. Homozygous mutant mice were not viable beyond
embryonic day 12.5 and had severe anemia with hydrops as well as diffuse
neurologic abnormalities. There was some variation of onset of severe
anemia, and in nonanemic embryos without tissue edema and necrosis
(E9.5), both stressed erythropoiesis and neurologic abnormalities were
apparent. The authors concluded that inadequate iron led to neuronal
apoptosis, but that tissues other than erythrocytes and neurons can
obtain sufficient iron for growth and development through mechanisms
independent of the transferrin cycle. Haploinsufficiency for the
transferrin receptor resulted in microcytic, hypochromic erythrocytes;
normal hemoglobin and hematocrit values were due to compensatory
increase in red cell numbers. Although iron saturation of serum
transferrin was indistinguishable from that of wildtype, heterozygotes
had significantly less tissue iron.

610635	TITLE *610635 COLLAGEN TRIPLE-HELIX REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; CTHRC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CTHRC1 is specifically expressed in vascular calcifications of carotid
artery lesions and may contribute to vascular remodeling of injured
arteries (Pyagay et al., 2005).

CLONING

By suppressive subtractive hybridization to identify genes
preferentially expressed in balloon-injured rat arteries, Pyagay et al.
(2005) cloned Cthrc1. Using 5-prime RACE, they cloned human CTHRC1 from
smooth muscle cell RNA. The deduced 243-amino acid human protein has an
N-terminal signal peptide and a short collagen (see COL1A1; 120150)
domain containing gly-X-Y repeats. Northern blot analysis revealed
Cthrc1 expression in rat lung and brain, with much lower levels in other
tissues examined. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry
localized rat Cthrc1 mRNA and protein to blood vessel adventitia at 8
and 14 days after balloon injury, with lower levels in developing
neointima. Significantly less Cthrc1 mRNA expression was detected 4
weeks after injury. Rat Cthrc1 protein was not detected in normal
arteries. Immunohistochemistry of human carotid artery lesion
endarterectomy samples detected CTHRC1 in vascular calcifications,
particularly at the outer margins of the calcification fronts, and in
chondrocyte-like cells surrounding the calcified tissue. Human CTHR1 was
not detected in noncalcified plaque regions.

GENE FUNCTION

By SDS-PAGE, glycosidase treatment, and collagenase analysis, Pyagay et
al. (2005) found that in vitro translated rat Cthrc1 was glycosylated
and formed a trimer, rendering it susceptible to cleavage by collagenase
(see 120353). Endogenous Cthrc1 mRNA levels increased in NIH3T3 mouse
fibroblasts following stimulation with BMP4 (112262) or TGFB1 (190180).
Scratch wound assays using Cthrc1-overexpressing rat smooth muscle cells
and mouse primary embryonic fibroblasts showed that Cthrc1 promoted cell
migration.

Yamamoto et al. (2008) found that Cthrc1 -/- mice appeared normal and
were fertile, but Cthrc1 -/- Vangl2 (600533) +/- mice displayed defects
in planar cell polarity comparable to those in Vangl2 -/- mice,
including midbrain neural tube closure defects and misorientation of
cochlear sensory hair cells. Since planar cell polarity requires Wnt
signaling, Yamamoto et al. (2008) examined interaction of mouse Cthrc1
with several components of the Wnt signaling pathway in transfected
HEK293T cells. They found that cell surface-anchored Cthrc1 bound to
specific Wnt proteins (e.g., WNT3A; 606359), Fzd proteins (e.g., FZD3;
606143), and Ror2 (602337), and that Cthrc1 enhanced the interaction of
Wnt proteins with Fzd-Ror2 by forming the Cthrc1-Wnt-Fzd-Ror2 complex.
Consistent with these findings, Ror2 -/- mice also showed planar cell
polarity-related abnormalities in the inner ear. Yamamoto et al. (2008)
concluded that CTHRC1 is a Wnt cofactor that selectively activates the
Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway by stabilizing ligand-receptor
interaction.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CTHRC1
gene to chromosome 8 (TMAP RH102528).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Orloff et al. (2011) identified a germline gln44-to-pro (Q44P;
610635.0001) mutation in the CTHRC1 gene in 1 (1.1%) of 116 patients of
European descent with Barrett esophagus and/or esophageal adenocarcinoma
(614266). The mutation was not found in 125 controls. The same mutation
was found in 1 (1.7%) of 58 independent cases in a replication study.
This genomic region was studied after being identified by genomewide
linkage analysis of 21 concordant and 11 discordant sib pairs with the
disorder. Orloff et al. (2011) suggested that variation in the CTHRC1
gene may be important in the host tissue repair response to
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD; 109350).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BARRETT ESOPHAGUS/ESOPHAGEAL ADENOCARCINOMA
CTHRC1, GLN44PRO

Orloff et al. (2011) identified a germline 131A-C transversion in exon 1
of the CTHRC1 gene, resulting in a gln44-to-pro (Q44P) substitution, in
1 (1.1%) of 116 patients of European descent with Barrett esophagus
and/or esophageal adenocarcinoma (614266). The mutation was not found in
125 controls. The same mutation was found in 1 (1.7%) of 58 independent
cases in a replication study. This genomic region was studied after
being identified by genomewide linkage analysis of 21 concordant and 11
discordant sib pairs with the disorders. Orloff et al. (2011) suggested
that variation in the CTHRC1 gene may be important in the host tissue
repair response to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
