605416	TITLE *605416 DICKKOPF, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF, 3; DKK3
DESCRIPTION For background information on WNT and Dickkopf proteins, see WNT6
(604663) and DKK1 (605189).

CLONING

By searching EST databases with a partial DKK3 sequence, followed by
probing a fetal brain cDNA library, Krupnik et al. (1999) isolated a
cDNA encoding DKK3. The deduced 350-amino acid DKK3 protein, like DKK1,
DKK2 (605415), and DKK4 (605417), possesses an N-terminal signal peptide
and 2 conserved cysteine-rich domains, which are separated by a linker
region and contain 10 cys residues each. The second cys region has a
putative lipid-binding function that may facilitate WNT/DKK interactions
at the plasma membrane. The linker region contains 50 to 55 amino acids
in DKK1, DKK2, and DKK4, whereas in DKK3 it contains only 12 amino
acids. DKK3 has 4 potential N-glycosylation sites and possesses an
extended N-terminal domain preceding the first cys domain as well as an
extended C-terminal region following the second cys domain. All DKKs
have several potential sites for cleavage by furin-type proteases.
Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of a 2.5-kb DKK3
transcript, with highest expression in heart, brain, and spinal cord. In
situ hybridization analysis demonstrated highest expression of Dkk3 in
mouse brain, eye, and heart. Western blot analysis showed that DKK3 is
secreted as a heterogeneous 45- to 65-kD protein; deglycosylation
reduced the protein to 40- and 45- to 55-kD proteins. Functional
analysis determined that DKK3 does not block Xenopus Wnt8 induction of a
secondary axis in frog embryos.

608402	TITLE *608402 MEMBRANE-SPANNING 4-DOMAINS, SUBFAMILY A, MEMBER 6E; MS4A6E
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Most MS4A genes encode proteins with at least 4 potential transmembrane
domains and N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains encoded by distinct
exons. The exception is MS4A6E, which encodes a protein with only 2
transmembrane domains and no C-terminal cytoplasmic domain.

CLONING

By searching for additional genes in the MS4A complex on chromosome
11q12-q13, Liang et al. (2001) identified MS4A4E (608401), MS4A10
(608403), and MS4A6E. The putative MS4A6E gene encodes a 147-amino acid
protein that is 78% identical to MS4A6A (606548), with high homology in
the hydrophobic regions and the intracellular N-terminal domain. MS4A6E
lacks a C-terminal intracellular domain. RT-PCR analysis failed to
detect MS4A6E transcripts in any tissues or hemopoietic cell lines
tested. EST database searching identified sequences from pooled fetal
organ libraries. Liang et al. (2001) proposed that expression may occur
primarily during oncogenesis or embryogenesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liang et al. (2001) determined that the MS4A6E gene contains at least 4
exons and spans more than 5 kb. It lacks the exons encoding the first 2
transmembrane domains found in most MS4A genes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Liang et al. (2001) mapped the MS4A6E gene
to chromosome 11q12-q13.1, between the MS4A4A (606547) and MS4A7
(606502) genes.

DYSTROPHIN-ASSOCIATED GLYCOPROTEIN, 25-KD;;
DAGA5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) is a multisubunit protein
complex that spans the sarcolemma and provides structural linkage
between the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix of
muscle cells. There are 3 main subcomplexes of the DGC: the cytoplasmic
proteins dystrophin (DMD; 300377) and syntrophin (SNTA1; 601017), the
alpha- and beta-dystroglycans (see 128239), and the sarcoglycans (see,
e.g., SGCA; 600119) (Crosbie et al., 2000). The SSPN gene encodes
sarcospan, another member of the DGC.

CLONING

Scott et al. (1994) reported the sequence of a murine gene that is
coamplified with Ki-ras (190070) in the Y1 murine adrenal carcinoma cell
line. The gene, which they designated Krag (Kirsten ras-associated
gene), encodes a predicted 216-amino acid protein with 4 potential
hydrophobic domains. Its hydropathy plot resembles certain of the
transmembrane-4 superfamily members such as CO-029 (600769) and ME491
(155740).

Heighway et al. (1996) isolated the human KRAG gene and showed that the
predicted amino acid sequence is 91% identical to the mouse sequence.
Northern blot analysis showed that KRAG is expressed in a variety of
tissues with highest levels in muscle, where alternative splice variants
were also observed. One end of the YAC contained a sequence that was
identical to that reported for inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type
2 (ITPR2; 600144), which had previously been mapped to 12p11.

Crosbie et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA for the 25-kD
dystrophin-associated protein from a human skeletal muscle cDNA library.
The cDNA encodes a protein with 4 transmembrane spanning domains, which
the authors termed 'sarcospan.' Northern blot analysis detected a 6.5-kb
mRNA transcript exclusively in skeletal and cardiac muscle; a 4.5-kb
mRNA transcript was also identified in skeletal and cardiac muscle as
well as in thymus, prostate, testes, ovary, small intestine, colon, and
spleen. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that sarcospan complexes
with and is an integral component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein
complex.

GENE STRUCTURE

Heighway et al. (1996) determined that the human KRAG gene contains 3
exons.

Scott et al. (1994) determined that the murine Krag gene contains 3
exons and spans about 20 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Heighway et al. (1996) mapped the
human KRAG gene to chromosome 12p11.2.

Scott et al. (1994) found that a homologous EST to murine Krag mapped to
chromosome 12.

GENE FUNCTION

Heighway et al. (1996) showed that KRAS2, KRAG, and ITPR2 were all
coamplified in lung and ovarian carcinoma cells.

Several autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (see
253600) are caused by primary mutations in sarcoglycan genes. Crosbie et
al. (2000) showed that the sarcospan protein is lost in patients with
either a complete or partial loss of alpha-, beta-, or gamma-sarcoglycan
(SGCG; 608896). In particular, sarcospan was absent in a
gamma-sarcoglycanopathy (LGDM2C; 253700) patient with normal levels of
alpha-, beta- (600900), and delta-sarcoglycan (601411). The authors
hypothesized that assembly of the complete, tetrameric sarcoglycan
complex is a prerequisite for membrane targeting and localization of
sarcospan. The authors screened over 50 autosomal recessive muscular
dystrophy cases for mutations in sarcospan, but none was identified.

610950	TITLE *610950 SYNAPTOTAGMIN 16; SYT16
;;SYNAPTOTAGMIN 14-RELATED PROTEIN; STREP14
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences encoding synaptotagmin-like C2
domains, Fukuda (2003) identified mouse and human SYT14 (610949) and
SYT16, which they called STREP14. The deduced mouse and human STREP14
proteins contain 639 and 625 amino acids, respectively. Both have
C-terminal C-type tandem C2 domains, but they lack the N-terminal
transmembrane domain found in other synaptotagmins. RT-PCR detected
highest Strep14 expression in mouse heart and testis, with weaker
expression in kidney and lung. In mouse embryos, expression was weak on
day 7 and strong on days 11, 15, and 17.

GENE FUNCTION

Fukuda (2003) found that mouse Strep14 showed relatively weak
homooligomerization and heterooligomerization with Syt14, irrespective
of the presence of Ca(2+). The C2 domains of Strep14 bound liposomes
made up of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Fukuda (2003) mapped the human SYT16 gene
to chromosome 14q23.1 and the mouse Syt16 gene to chromosome 12C3.

608110	TITLE *608110 p21 PROTEIN-ACTIVATED KINASE 6; PAK6
;;p21 CDC42/RAC1-ACTIVATED KINASE 6
DESCRIPTION For background information on p21-activated kinases (PAKs), see PAK1
(602590).

CLONING

Using androgen receptor (AR; 313700) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen,
followed by 5-prime RACE, Yang et al. (2001) cloned PAK6 from a prostate
cDNA library. The deduced 681-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of about 75 kD. In vitro translation confirmed that PAK6
is a 75-kD protein. Like other members of the PAK family, PAK6 has an
N-terminal CDC42 (116952)/RAC (602048) interactive binding (CRIB) domain
and a C-terminal kinase domain. The C-terminal kinase domain of PAK6
shares 78% similarity with the corresponding regions of PAK4 (605451)
and PAK7 (608038). Northern blot analysis detected a 4.5-kb PAK6
transcript expressed at a high level in testis and at a lower level in
prostate. No expression was detected in the other tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

In a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Yang et al. (2001) found a 170-fold increase
in the association between PAK6 and AR in the presence of
dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed
that the interaction between PAK6 and AR required DHT. The isolated
kinase domain of PAK6 was active against a test substrate, while
full-length PAK6 showed lower kinase activity.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the PAK6 gene to chromosome 15q15.1 based on an
alignment of the PAK6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC035596) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION For background information on the NBPF gene family, see NBPF1 (610501).

CLONING

By searching EST databases for NBPF family members, Vandepoele et al.
(2005) identified NBPF3. EST database analysis suggested ubiquitous
NBPF3 expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vandepoele et al. (2005) determined that the NBPF3 gene contains 13
coding exons.

Vandepoele and van Roy (2007) found that, unlike other transcriptionally
active NBPF family members, NBPF3 lacks an insertion of a human
endogenous retrovirus K long-terminal repeat in its 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and FISH, Vandepoele et al. (2005) mapped
the NBPF3 gene to chromosome 1p36, where it lies in a cluster with NBPF1
and a pseudogene, NBPF2P.

DESCRIPTION A 120-kD oviductal glycoprotein is secreted into the oviductal lumen
during the estrogen-dominated follicular and periovulatory phases of the
menstrual cycle. Arias et al. (1994) cloned the cDNA encoding the
oviductal glycoprotein. The sequence predicts a 654-amino acid
polypeptide that contains 4 potential N-glycosylation sites, 2 potential
N-myristoylation sites, and several potential phosphorylation sites. The
sequence has approximately 50% similarity to those of a subfamily of
glycosyl hydrolases. Northern blot analysis revealed a 2.4-kb message in
oviduct, but none in endometrium, cervix, or a variety of other tissues.
Slot blot analysis revealed that the expression of OVGP1 is highest
during the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, suggesting that
estrogen may control its expression.

608853	TITLE *608853 BH3-LIKE MOTIF-CONTAINING CELL DEATH INDUCER; BLID
;;BREAST CANCER CELL 2; BRCC2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Broustas et al. (2004) amplified a BRCC2 cDNA from breast cancer cell
line mRNA. The deduced 108-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 12 kD. The N terminus contains a domain similar to the BH3
domain of proapoptotic proteins. Western blot analysis detected
endogenous BRCC2 in all human cell lines tested. In COS-1 and HeLa
cells, BRCC2 was predominantly a cytosolic protein, with lower abundance
in mitochondria.

GENE FUNCTION

Broustas et al. (2004) found that exogenous expression of BRCC2 caused
apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by enhanced chromatin condensation,
DNA fragmentation, or an enhanced number of cells in the sub-G1 phase.
In a human prostate cancer cell line, BRCC2-induced DNA fragmentation
was blocked by coexpression of the antiapoptotic molecule BCLXL (600039)
or by a broad-range caspase inhibitor. BRCC2 expression correlated with
activation of CASP3 (600636) and CASP9 (602234). BRCC2 with an
N-terminal deletion of the BH3-like domain failed to induce apoptosis.
Treatment of HeLa cells with doxorubicin or hydrogen peroxide led to an
increase in the mitochondrial level of endogenous BRCC2. Broustas et al.
(2004) concluded that BRCC2 functions as a proapoptotic molecule through
the caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway of cell death.

GENE STRUCTURE

Broustas et al. (2004) determined that BRCC2 is an intronless gene.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Broustas et al. (2004) mapped the BLID
gene to chromosome 11q24.1.

Rogaeva et al. (2007) indicated that the BRCC2 gene is located just
distal to SORL1 (602005).

608172	TITLE *608172 DEHYDRODOLICHYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE; DHDDS
;;DEDOL-PP SYNTHASE;;
HDS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dehydrodolichyl diphosphate (dedol-PP) synthase catalyzes cis-prenyl
chain elongation to produce the polyprenyl backbone of dolichol, a
glycosyl carrier lipid required for the biosynthesis of several classes
of glycoproteins (summary by Endo et al., 2003).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to E. coli undecaprenyl
diphosphate synthase (UPS) and S. cerevisiae dedol-PP synthase, followed
by RT-PCR of a testis cDNA library, Endo et al. (2003) cloned DHDDS,
which they designated HDS. The deduced 333-amino acid DHDDS protein
contains all 5 regions conserved among cis-prenyl chain-elongating
enzymes in several eukaryotic and prokaryotic species. DHDDS shares
41.8% homology with yeast dedol-PP synthase and 37.6% homology with E.
coli UPS. Northern blot analysis detected high DHDDS expression in
testis and kidney, with lower levels in heart, spleen, and thymus.

Zelinger et al. (2011) performed RT-PCR analysis in 21 human tissues and
observed ubiquitous expression of DHDDS, with a band of higher intensity
in the retinal sample compare to other tissues. The analysis confirmed
the expression of the full-length transcript in the retina as well as 3
alternatively spliced variants, 2 of which were in-frame and likely to
encode a protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Endo et al. (2003) determined that the DHDDS gene contains 8 coding
exons and spans more than 37 kb. Zelinger et al. (2011) noted that the
DHDDS gene contains 9 exons and that exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Endo et al. (2003) mapped the DHDDS gene
to chromosome 1p35.

By genomic sequence analysis, Zelinger et al. (2011) mapped the DHDDS
gene to chromosome 1p36.11.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro assay, Endo et al. (2003) demonstrated cis-prenyltransferase
activity in DHDDS-transformed yeast membrane fractions incubated with
radiolabeled isopentenyl diphosphate and farnesyl diphosphate as
substrates. Thin-layer chromatography detected synthesis of high levels
of dolichols with major chain lengths of C90, C95, and C100, consistent
with dolichols isolated from human tissues.

Zelinger et al. (2011) performed immunohistochemical analysis of the
human retina with anti-DHDDS antibodies and observed intense labeling of
the cone and rod photoreceptor inner segments.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 affected sibs from an Ashkenazi Jewish family with retinitis
pigmentosa (RP59; 613861), in whom mutation in all known RP genes had
been excluded, Zuchner et al. (2011) performed whole-exome sequencing
and identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the DDHS gene
(K42E; 608172.0001) that was not present in their unaffected sib. The
unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was
detected in heterozygosity in 8 of 717 Ashkenazi Jewish controls but was
not found in 6,977 confirmed non-Ashkenazi white controls; the variant
was also found once in 5,893 additional white controls for whom
genomewide genotype data were not available. Zuchner et al. (2011)
stated that E42K likely arose from an ancestral founder.

In 15 (12%) of 123 Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) probands with RP, Zelinger et
al. (2011) identified homozygosity for the K42E founder mutation. The
K42E mutation was found in heterozygosity in 1 of 322 ethnically matched
controls, indicating a carrier frequency of 0.3% in the AJ population,
but was not detected in an additional set of 109 AJ patients with RP, in
20 AJ patients with other inherited retinal diseases, or in 70 patients
with retinal degeneration of other ethnic origins.

ANIMAL MODEL

By morpholino-knockdown of Dhdds in zebrafish, Zuchner et al. (2011)
observed failure to exhibit the typical escape response to light on-off
switches, and microscopic examination of the morphant retina revealed
that photoreceptor outer segments were very short or completely missing;
in addition, one-third of zebrafish morphants had smaller eyes and a
slight ventral flexion to the body axis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 59
DHDDS, LYS42GLU

In 3 affected sibs from an Ashkenazi Jewish family with retinitis
pigmentosa (RP59; 613861), Zuchner et al. (2011) identified homozygosity
for a 124A-G transition in exon 3 of the DHDDS gene, resulting in a
lys42-to-glu (K42E) substitution at a highly conserved residue located
close to the catalytic center and the substrate binding site for
farnesyl phosphate. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation, which was also detected in heterozygosity in 8 of 717
Ashkenazi Jewish controls but not found in 6,977 confirmed non-Ashkenazi
white controls; the variant was also found once in 5,893 additional
white controls for whom genomewide genotype data were not available.

In 20 Ashkenazi Jewish patients with RP from 15 families, Zelinger et
al. (2011) identified homozygosity for the E42K founder mutation in exon
3 of the DHDDS gene.

609977	TITLE *609977 CELL DIVISION CYCLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 8; CDCA8
;;DASRA B;;
BOREALIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CDCA8 is a component of a chromosomal passenger complex required for
stability of the bipolar mitotic spindle (Gassmann et al., 2004).

CLONING

By database analysis, Sampath et al. (2004) identified human CDCA8 as a
homolog of Xenopus Dasra B. The deduced 280-amino acid human protein,
which the authors called Dasra B, shares 42% and 23% identity with
Xenopus Dasra B and Dasra A, respectively. Immunofluorescence on
metaphase HeLa cells revealed Dasra B in a punctate distribution on
chromosomes, coincident with Aurora B (AURKB; 604970) staining.

Using a proteomic screen to identify proteins associated with
histone-depleted mitotic chromosomes, Gassmann et al. (2004) identified
CDCA8, which they called borealin. The deduced 280-amino acid protein
contains 2 putative nuclear localization signals. Secondary structure
predictions suggested borealin forms an N-terminal domain of 6 core
helices and a C-terminal domain of at least 2 strands and 3 helices.
Northern and Western blot analyses showed that borealin mRNA and protein
levels were significantly increased in mitosis. Immunolocalization of
borealin and Aurora B in HeLa cells revealed that the proteins
colocalized in a dynamic pattern throughout mitosis. Western blot
analysis detected borealin at an apparent molecular mass of 31 kD in
HeLa cell lysates.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation of HeLa cell lysates, Sampath et al. (2004) found
that Dasra B interacted with Aurora B and survivin (BIRC5; 603352).
Knockdown of Dasra B by small interfering RNA resulted in severe
chromosome misalignment at metaphase and accumulation of multiple
interphase nuclei. In Xenopus, Dasra B associated with survivin, Aurora
B, and Incenp (604411) in a chromosomal passenger complex required for
chromatin-induced microtubule stabilization and spindle formation.
Microtubule nucleation through the Dasra B-containing chromosomal
passenger complex was distinct from the Ran (601179)-GTP pathway of
chromatin-induced microtubule nucleation.

Using in vitro binding assays, Gassmann et al. (2004) showed that
recombinant human borealin interacted directly with in vitro translated
INCENP and survivin, but not with Aurora B or TD60 (RCC2; 609587).
Borealin also readily bound itself. Mutation analysis indicated that the
N-terminal domain of borealin, but not the C-terminal domain, interacted
with chromosomal passengers in vivo and could perturb their targeting to
centromeres but not to the spindle midzone. Knockdown of borealin in
HeLa cells by RNA interference resulted in delocalization of INCENP,
survivin, Aurora B, and TD60 and delayed mitotic progression.
Borealin-null cells showed kinetochore-spindle misattachments, increased
number of bipolar spindles associated with ectopic asters, and disrupted
chromosome partitioning at anaphase. Borealin did not increase the
kinase activity of Aurora B in the presence of INCENP and survivin, but
it was an Aurora B target protein.

Tsukahara et al. (2010) isolated a fission yeast cyclin B (123836)
mutant defective specifically in chromosome biorientation. Accordingly,
Tsukahara et al. (2010) identified Cdk1 (116940)-cyclin B-dependent
phosphorylation of survivin (603352). Preventing survivin
phosphorylation impaired centromere chromosomal passenger complex (CPC)
targeting as well as chromosome biorientation, whereas phosphomimetic
survivin suppressed the biorientation defect in the cyclin B mutant.
Survivin phosphorylation promoted direct binding with shugoshin (see
609168), which Tsukahara et al. (2010) defined as a conserved
centromeric adaptor of the CPC. In human cells, the phosphorylation of
borealin has a comparable role. Tsukahara et al. (2010) concluded that
this study resolved the conserved mechanisms of CPC targeting to
centromeres, highlighting a key role of Cdk1-cyclin B in chromosome
biorientation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gassmann et al. (2004) determined that the CDCA8 gene contains 10 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gassmann et al. (2004) mapped the CDCA8
gene to chromosome 1. They identified a possible pseudogene on
chromosome 7.

;;GLUCOSAMINE-6-SULFATASE; G6S
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Freeman et al. (1987) reported purification and characterization of
N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.14), which hydrolyzes heparan
sulfate and keratan sulfate. They identified 4 forms of the enzyme in
liver, which were postulated to be due to differences in the state of
processing of a large subunit. The catalytic properties were studied by
Freeman and Hopwood (1987). Using sequences obtained by direct
N-terminal amino acid sequencing of G6S isoforms, Robertson et al.
(1988) designed oligonucleotide probes to screen a liver cDNA library.
The longest clone obtained encoded a deduced 375-amino acid protein
representing form A of G6S. They also identified a clone that represents
the 331-amino acid form B of G6S. Robertson et al. (1988) determined
that the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 78-kD form A species and
the 32-kD form B species are identical, indicating that the 78-kD form A
polypeptide is processed by internal peptidase cleavage to a 32-kD
N-terminal species and a 48-kD C-terminal species. Full-length G6S
contains several N-glycosylation sites and a hydrophilic region, rich in
basic amino acids, that may represent the proteolytic cleavage site.

Dhoot et al. (2001) reported the identification of QSulf1, an avian
ortholog of GNS. QSulf1 expression is induced by Sonic hedgehog in
myogenic somite progenitors in quail embryos and is required for the
activation of MyoD (159970), a Wnt (see 164820)-induced regulator of
muscle specification. QSulf1 is localized on the cell surface and
regulates heparan-dependent Wnt signaling in C2C12 myogenic progenitor
cells through a mechanism that requires its catalytic activity,
providing evidence that QSulf1 regulates Wnt signaling through
desulfation of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans.

MAPPING

Robertson et al. (1988) assigned the glucosamine-6-sulfatase gene, which
they symbolized G6S, to chromosome 12q14 by in situ hybridization of a
tritium-labeled G6S cDNA probe. The localization was confirmed by using
the cDNA clone in 7 analyses of DNA from human/mouse hybrid cell lines.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mok et al. (2003) amplified and sequenced the promoter and 14 exons of
the GNS gene from a patient with mucopolysaccharidosis type IIID
(252940) and identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 9,
predicted to result in premature termination at codon 355 (607664.0001).
They also identified 2 common synonymous coding SNPs and genotyped these
in samples from 4 ethnic groups.

Independently, Beesley et al. (2003) identified a 1-bp deletion in the
GNS gene (607664.0002) in a patient with Sanfilippo disease
(mucopolysaccharidosis) type D.

Elcioglu et al. (2009) reported a 10-year-old Turkish boy with
Sanfilippo syndrome type D, in whom they identified homozygosity for a
1-bp insertion in the GNS gene (607664.0005). The authors stated that
this was the twenty-first patient and the eighth mutation reported for
the disease.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIID
GNS, ARG355TER

In the fibroblast cell line of the 7-year-old East Indian boy with
mucopolysaccharidosis type IIID (252940) described by Kresse et al.
(1980), Mok et al. (2003) identified a homozygous 1063C-T transition in
exon 9 of the GNS gene, predicting a premature termination of
translation at codon 355 (R355X).

.0002
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIID
GNS, 1-BP DEL, 1169A

In a patient with mucopolysaccharidosis type IIID (252940), Beesley et
al. (2003) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion, 1169delA, in the
GNS gene. The mutation was predicted to cause a frameshift and premature
termination of the protein. The patient was the offspring of
first-cousin parents from Pakistan. He presented at 3 years of age, at
which time he was very 'lively' and examination was difficult as he was
very fractious. He had a hirsute facies and his facial features were
coarse. He had a large head with frontal bossing, a low nasal bridge,
and a tendency to hypertelorism. His tongue and hands were large. There
was no hepatosplenomegaly or audible murmurs. A skeletal survey was
consistent with a mucopolysaccharidosis.

.0003
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIID
GNS, GLN390TER

In 2 Italian Canadian brothers with mucopolysaccharidosis type IIID
(252940), originally reported by Kaplan and Wolfe (1987), Jansen et al.
(2007) identified a homozygous 1168C-T transition in exon 10 of the GNS
gene, resulting in a gln390-to-ter (Q390X) substitution. Each unaffected
parent was heterozygous for the mutation.

.0004
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIID
GNS, 5-BP INS, 1138GTCCT

In a 15-year-old Turkish English girl with mucopolysaccharidosis type
IIID (252940), Jansen et al. (2007) identified a homozygous 5-bp
insertion (1138insGTCCT) in exon 10 of the GNS gene, resulting in a
frameshift and premature termination of the protein at residue 389. She
was severely retarded and fully dependent on assistance for all
activities of daily living.

.0005
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIID
GNS, 1-BP INS, 1226G

In a 10-year-old Turkish boy with mucopolysaccharidosis type IIID
(252940), Elcioglu et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp
insertion (1226insG) in exon 11 of the GNS gene, predicted to cause a
frameshift and premature termination with loss of the C terminus. The
boy's parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in
100 controls.

610488	TITLE *610488 TETRATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 9; TTC9
;;KIAA0227
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated myeloid leukemia
cell line cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned TTC9, which they
called KIAA0227. The deduced protein contains 336 amino acids. Northern
blot analysis detected TTC9 expression in all tissues examined, with
highest expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas.

Cao et al. (2006) determined that TTC9 encodes a predicted 222-amino
acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 24.4 kD. It has 3
C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domains and several potential
N-myristoylation sites, but no transmembrane domain. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.5-kb TTC9 transcript in a breast cancer cell line.
Northern blot analysis of several human tissues showed variable
expression of 2.5-, 5.1-, and 5.9-kb TTC9 transcripts. Expression of
TTC9 was highest in brain, followed by heart. Western blot analysis
revealed a 25-kD endogenous TTC9 protein in a breast cancer cell line.
Analysis of several normal tissues showed the 25-kD protein in all
tissues examined except liver. A doublet of 36 to 37 kD was also
expressed in brain. Cell fractionation experiments and
immunohistochemical analysis showed that TTC9 was predominantly
associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, although a small fraction was
cytoplasmic.

GENE FUNCTION

By microarray analysis, Cao et al. (2006) found that expression of TTC9
was regulated by progesterone in a breast cancer cell line expressing
progesterone receptor (PGR; 607311). They showed that TTC9 levels were
also regulated by estrogen, growth factors, and an inhibitor of p38
kinase (MAPK14; 600289). Growth factor-induced TTC9 expression was
inhibited by estrogen and abolished by an ERK (see 601795) inhibitor.
The hormonal effect on TTC9 expression was cell-line specific, and TTC9
appeared to be upregulated when the hormonal effect on cells was growth
inhibitory and downregulated when the hormonal effect was stimulatory.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid and human-rodent cell hybrid analyses, Nagase et al.
(1996) mapped the TTC9 gene to chromosome 14. Cao et al. (2006) stated
that the TTC9 gene maps to chromosome 14q24.2.

;;TGFB REGULATOR 1;;
NUCLEAR INTERACTOR OF ARF AND MDM2; NIAM
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the p19(Arf) isoform of mouse Cdkn2a (600160) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cDNA library, followed
by RT-PCR of human pancreas cDNA, Tompkins et al. (2006) cloned mouse
and human TBRG1, which they called NIAM. The deduced human protein
contains 411 amino acids.

Using Northern blot analysis, Babalola and Schultz (1995) detected
expression of Tbrg1, which they called Tb5, in all mouse tissues
examined. Highest expression was in testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro and in vivo binding assays, including reciprocal
immunoprecipitation assays, Tompkins et al. (2006) confirmed that NIAM
bound p19(ARF), but not the p16(INK4A) isoform of CDKN2A. NIAM appeared
to function downstream of p19(ARF) in G1-phase growth arrest in both p53
(TP53; 191170)-dependent and p53-independent signaling pathways. NIAM
expression was induced in cells undergoing arrest in response to DNA
damage and TGF-beta-1 (TGFB1; 190180) treatment, suggesting it may also
participate in antiproliferative pathways.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TBRG1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP STS-T95820).

606493	TITLE *606493 EXOSOME COMPONENT 1; EXOSC1
;;CSL4, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; CSL4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Inherently unstable mammalian mRNAs contain AU-rich elements (AREs)
within their 3-prime untranslated regions. In yeast, 3-prime-to-5-prime
mRNA degradation is mediated by the exosome, a multisubunit particle.
Chen et al. (2001) purified and characterized the human exosome by mass
spectrometry and found its composition to be similar to its yeast
counterpart. They identified the following protein subunits within the
human exosome: p7, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp4 protein
(602238); p8, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp42 protein (606488);
p9, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp43 protein (OIP2; 606019); p10,
which is homologous to the yeast Rrp40 protein (606489); p11, which is
homologous to the yeast Mtr3 protein (606490); p12A, which is homologous
to the yeast Rrp41 protein (606491); p12B, which is homologous to the
yeast Rrp46 protein (606492); and p13, which is homologous to the yeast
Csl4 protein. They also identified 2 exosome-associated factors, p1
(600478) and p14 (MPP6; 605500), that were not homologous to any yeast
exosome components.

Raijmakers et al. (2002) stated that the CSL4 protein contains 195 amino
acids and has a molecular mass of 21 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a cell-free RNA decay system, Chen et al. (2001) demonstrated that
the mammalian exosome is required for rapid degradation of
ARE-containing RNAs but not for poly(A) shortening. They found that the
mammalian exosome does not recognize ARE-containing RNAs on its own. ARE
recognition required certain ARE-binding proteins that could interact
with the exosome and recruit it to unstable RNAs, thereby promoting
their rapid degradation.

Using mammalian 2-hybrid and GST pull-down analyses, Raijmakers et al.
(2002) found that the CSL4 protein, but not mutant forms lacking N- or
C-terminal residues, interacted directly with RRP42 and RRP46. The
deletion mutants were also unable to interact with the exosome. RRP42
and RRP46 did not interact with each other.

114780	TITLE *114780 CARBONIC ANHYDRASE VI; CA6
;;CA VI;;
CARBONIC ANHYDRASE, SECRETED;;
GUSTIN
DESCRIPTION Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are a family of zinc metalloenzymes. For
background information on the CA family, see 114800.

CA VI is a 42-kD secreted isozyme found in salivary glands and saliva
(Murakami and Sly, 1987). By using biochemical and immunohistochemical
techniques, Karhumaa et al. (2001) demonstrated that CA VI is also an
elementary component of milk.

Aldred et al. (1991) isolated and sequenced cDNA clones coding for CA6.
The clones identified a 1.45-kb mRNA that was present in high levels in
parotid submandibular salivary glands but absent in other tissues such
as sublingual gland, kidney, liver, and prostate. The cDNA encoded a
protein of 308 amino acids that included a 17-amino acid leader sequence
typical of secreted proteins. The mature CA VI protein has 291 amino
acids, compared to the 259 or 260 residues of the cytoplasmic isozymes;
most of the extra amino acids present are in the carboxyl terminal
region. CA VI has diverged significantly in its structure from the
cytoplasmic isozymes, including CA I (114800), CA II (611492), and CA
III (114750), which are closely related to one another. The CA VI
protein has 35% sequence identity with human CA II, while residues
involved in the active site of the enzymes have been conserved. Southern
analysis of human DNA indicated that there is only 1 gene coding for CA
VI.

Thatcher et al. (1998) identified gustin as CA6. Gustin contains 2
potential N-linked glycosylation sites. By RP-HPLC and SDS-PAGE, gustin
purified from human saliva had a molecular mass of 37 kD before
deglycosylation and 33 kD after.

Karhumaa et al. (2001) showed that the 42-kD CA VI glycopolypeptide
purified from human milk shares 100% homology with salivary CA VI in
protein sequence. They found that its concentration is approximately 8
times higher in human colostrum than in mature milk, the latter
corresponding to the levels previously detected in human saliva. The
high concentration in colostrum, in particular its functional and
structural stability in an acidic milieu, and its growth-supporting role
in the taste buds suggest that milk CA VI is an essential factor in
normal growth and development of the infant alimentary tract.

By means of Southern analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and by in
situ hybridization, Sutherland et al. (1989) mapped the CA6 gene to
1p36.33-p36.22. White et al. (1998) reported physical mapping of the
CA6, ENO1 (172430), and SLC2A5 (138230) genes to 1p36 by study of yeast-
and P1-artificial chromosome (YAC and PAC) contigs. PACs from the contig
were mapped to 1p36.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

;;GENE UPSTREAM OF NRAS;;
UNR;;
D1S155E
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

While investigating NRAS (164790), Jeffers et al. (1990) isolated cDNAs
that originated from a closely linked upstream gene on chromosome 1.
RNase protection assays showed that this gene, termed UNR by them, is
transcribed in the same direction as NRAS and that its 3-prime end is
located only 130 bp from the transcription initiation site of NRAS. The
close spatial relationship was conserved in all species from which the
NRAS gene had been isolated. The UNR cDNA contained an open reading
frame capable of encoding a protein of 798 amino acids. UNR transcripts
were detected in mouse, rat, and human cells. Only a single copy of UNR
was detected in the mouse. The gene produced multiple transcripts that
differed in their 3-prime ends and apparently resulted from the
differential use of multiple polyadenylation sites located in the
3-prime untranslated region of the gene. Both UNR and NRAS were
expressed in all tissues examined and the 2 genes may be coordinately
regulated. UNR was first isolated by Doniger and DiPaolo (1988) in
tumorigenic guinea pig cells.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned full-length UNR, which they
designated KIAA0885. The deduced 798-amino acid protein shares 98.6%
amino acid identity with rat Unr. RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression
in all tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

AU-rich elements and protein-coding determinants direct rapid removal of
poly(A) tails as a necessary first step in mRNA decay. Grosset et al.
(2000) determined that 5 proteins form a multiprotein complex associated
with the major protein-coding-region determinant of instability (mCRD)
of the FOS gene (164810): PABP (604679), HNRNPD (601324), PAIP1
(605184), NSAP1, and UNR, a purine-rich RNA-binding protein.
Overexpression of these proteins stabilized mCRD-containing mRNA by
impeding deadenylation.

Chang et al. (2004) presented evidence that UNR is a critical factor in
mCRD-mediated mRNA turnover by binding the mCRD motif and by interacting
with PABP. Their findings indicated that the mCRD-UNR complex serves as
a platform for formation of a deadenylation/decay mRNA-protein complex
involving PABP and the poly(A) nuclease CCR4 (608951).

MAPPING

Jeffers et al. (1990) mapped the UNR gene to chromosome 1, upstream of
the NRAS gene. By FISH, Edwards et al. (1997) localized the gene to
1p13.2.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Purine 5-prime-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5) preferentially hydrolyzes
inosine 5-prime-monophosphate (IMP) and other purine nucleotides, and is
allosterically activated by various compounds, including ATP. The enzyme
is exclusively located in the cytoplasmic matrix of cells and may have a
critical role in the maintenance of a constant composition of
intracellular purine/pyrimidine nucleotides in cooperation with other
nucleotidases.

CLONING

Oka et al. (1994) found 2 distinct but closely related types of cDNAs
for purine 5-prime-nucleotidase in a chicken liver cDNA library. The
encoded A- and B-type proteins were similar throughout a central core of
472 amino acids sharing 79% sequence identity. Using degenerate
oligonucleotides based on identical portions of amino acid sequences
between A- and B-type subunits of the chicken enzyme, Oka et al. (1994)
isolated human cytosolic purine 5-prime-nucleotidase cDNA clones with
PCR. The predicted open reading frame encoded a protein of 561 amino
acids with a molecular mass of 64,966 Da. The deduced amino acid
sequence exhibited 95% identity with the sequence of the B-type subunit
of chicken enzyme. Northern blot analysis of placental polyadenylated
RNA revealed a single band of 3.6 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the NT5C2
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP sts-D38524).

180903	TITLE *180903 RYANODINE RECEPTOR 3; RYR3
;;RYANODINE RECEPTOR, BRAIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ryanodine receptors, such as RYR3, are intracellular calcium ion release
channels responsible for the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores
following transduction of many different extracellular stimuli.

CLONING

Hakamata et al. (1992) deduced the complete amino acid sequence of a
novel ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel from rabbit brain by
cloning and sequence analysis of the cDNA. The protein was composed of
4,872 amino acids and shared characteristic structural features with the
skeletal muscle (RYR1; 180901) and cardiac (RYR2; 180902) ryanodine
receptors. RNA blot hybridization analysis showed that the brain
ryanodine receptor is abundantly expressed in corpus striatum, thalamus,
and hippocampus, whereas the cardiac ryanodine receptor is more
uniformly expressed in the brain. The brain ryanodine receptor gene was
also transcribed in smooth muscle.

Using rabbit Ryr3 cDNA as probe, Nakashima et al. (1997) cloned RYR3
from a brain cDNA library. The deduced 4,866-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of about 551 kD. RYR3 contains 4 repeated
sequences organized into 2 tandem pairs, as well as 4 highly hydrophobic
C-terminal segments. It does not have an N-terminal signal sequence.
Northern blot analysis detected a 16-kb transcript expressed at high
levels in caudate nucleus, amygdala, and hippocampus, and at lower
levels in corpus callosum, substantia nigra, and thalamus. Abundant
expression was also detected in skeletal muscle, and a faint signal was
detected in heart.

Leeb and Brenig (1998) isolated overlapping human RYR3 clones from a
random primed fetal brain cDNA library. The gene encodes a 4,870-amino
acid polypeptide that contains 4 RYR repeats, 3 SPRY domains, an ATP/GTP
binding site consensus sequence, and 3 potential calmodulin-binding
sites. They identified an alternatively spliced transcript that encodes
a truncated protein.

Jiang et al. (2003) identified 7 alternatively spliced variants of
rabbit Ryr3 that were expressed in a tissue-specific manner.

GENE FUNCTION

By functional expression of RYR3 and a chimeric RYR, Nakashima et al.
(1997) confirmed that RYR3 forms a calcium release channel with low
Ca(2+) sensitivity.

Jiang et al. (2003) characterized several rabbit Ryr3 splice variants.
One variant lacked a predicted transmembrane helix encoded by exon 92
and was highly expressed in smooth muscle tissues, but not in skeletal
muscle, heart, or brain. This variant did not form a functional Ca(2+)
channel when expressed alone in HEK293 cells, but it formed functional
heteromeric channels with reduced caffeine sensitivity when coexpressed
with wildtype Ryr3. This variant was also able to form heteromeric
channels with and suppress the activity of Ryr2 in a dominant-negative
manner. Jiang et al. (2003) concluded that the heterogeneity of Ryr3
splice variants may explain the unique tissue-specific pharmacologic and
functional properties of Ryr3.

MAPPING

By isotopic in situ hybridization, Sorrentino et al. (1993) mapped the
RYR3 gene to 15q14-q15; 15q15 is a probable location. By in situ
hybridization, Mattei et al. (1994) mapped the type 3 ryanodine receptor
to mouse chromosome 2E5-2F3. Richard et al. (1994) presented an
integrated physical, expression, and genetic map of chromosome 15. They
found that the RYR3 gene fell in their region I: 15pter-q14.

ANIMAL MODEL

Takeshima et al. (1996), Bertocchini et al. (1997), and Futatsugi et al.
(1999) independently generated Ryr3-deficient mice. In all cases, the
homozygous mutant mice were fertile and displayed no gross
abnormalities. Takeshima et al. (1996) detected increased locomotor
activity in Ryr3 knockout mice compared to that of the control mice and
concluded that the lack of Ryr3-mediated Ca(2+) signaling results in
abnormalities of certain neurons in the central nervous system.

Bertocchini et al. (1997) detected normal Ryr3 expression in murine
skeletal muscles during the postnatal phase of muscle development, but
not in muscles of adult mice, with the exception of the diaphragm and
soleus muscles. The authors demonstrated that skeletal muscle
contraction in Ryr3 knockout mice was impaired during the first weeks
after birth. They concluded that Ryr3 has a physiologic role in
excitation-contraction coupling of neonatal skeletal muscles.

Futatsugi et al. (1999) measured the electrophysiologic and
pharmacologic properties of synaptic plasticity in the CA1 area of
Ryr3-deficient mice. The results suggested that Ryr3-mediated
intracellular calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum may inhibit
hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial learning.

Barone et al. (1998) generated double mutant mice carrying a targeted
disruption of both the Ryr1 and Ryr3 genes. Skeletal muscles from mice
homozygous for both mutations did not contract in response to caffeine
or ryanodine. In addition, these muscles showed very low tension when
directly activated with micromolar ionized calcium after membrane
permeabilization, indicating either poor development or degeneration of
the myofibrils. This was confirmed by biochemical analysis of
contractile proteins. Electron microscopy confirmed small size of
myofibrils and showed complete absence of feet (RyRs) in the junctional
sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Balschun et al. (1999) found that hippocampal tissue from Ryr3 knockout
mice showed no morphologic changes and had robust in vitro LTP induced
by repeated strong tetanization in the CA1 region, similar to control
tissue. However, the hippocampal tissue from the mutant mice showed
significantly impaired initial amplitude of potentiation and LTP
maintenance in response to weak tetanization compared to controls. In a
water maze test, the mutant animals showed normal learning acquisition
but had deficits in spatial learning, suggesting impaired synaptic
plasticity. Balschun et al. (1999) concluded that RYR3 has a functional
role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, specifically on the adaptation
of acquired memory in response to external changes or stimuli.

601054	TITLE *601054 PLEXIN A2; PLXNA2
;;PLEXIN 2; PLXN2;;
TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN OCT; OCT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Maestrini et al. (1996) identified PLXNA2, which they called OCT, as a
gene closely related to SEX (300022), a transmembrane protein with
significant homology to members of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)
receptor family. They also identified 2 other genes closely related to
SEX, PLXNB1 (601053) and PLXNA1 (601055). The proteins encoded by all 4
genes contain large cytoplasmic domains characterized by a distinctive
highly conserved sequence that Maestrini et al. (1996) called the SEX
domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Suto et al. (2007) found that mouse plexin-A2 preferentially localized
to pyramidal cell dendrites, but not to mossy fibers. In contrast,
plexin-A4 localized to mossy fibers. Sema6a (605885) was expressed and
secreted by CA3 pyramidal cells and interneurons in the stratum
lacunosum-moleculare and functioned with plexin-A4 as a repressive
molecule to mediate mossy fiber repulsion. Plexin-A2 attenuated
Sema6a-mediated mossy fiber repulsion, possibly by sequestration of
Sema6a, allowing mossy fibers to invade the suprapyramidal region of
CA3. Suto et al. (2007) concluded that Sema6a, plexin-A2, and plexin-A4
regulate the laminar projection of mossy fibers in mouse hippocampus.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Janssen et al. (2010) presented crystal structures of cognate complexes
of the semaphorin-binding regions of plexins B1 and A2 with semaphorin
ectodomains (human PLXNB1-SEMA4D (601866) and murine PlxnA2-Sema6A
(605885)), plus unliganded structures of PlxnA2(1-4) and Sema6A(ecto).
These structures, together with biophysical and cellular assays of
wildtype and mutant proteins, revealed that semaphorin dimers
independently bind 2 plexin molecules and that signaling is critically
dependent on the avidity of the resulting bivalent 2:2 complex
(monomeric semaphorin binds plexin but fails to trigger signaling). The
data of Janssen et al. (2010) favored a cell-cell signaling mechanism
involving semaphorin-stabilized plexin dimerization, possibly followed
by clustering, which is consistent with previous functional data.
Furthermore, the shared generic architecture of the complexes, formed
through conserved contacts of the amino-terminal 7-bladed beta-propeller
(sema) domains of both semaphorin and plexin, suggested that a common
mode of interaction triggers all semaphorin-plexin-based signaling,
while distinct insertions within or between blades of the sema domains
determine binding specificity.

Nogi et al. (2010) independently reported the crystal structure of the
semaphorin 6A (605885) receptor-binding fragment and the plexin A2
ligand-binding fragment in both their pre-signaling (before binding) and
signaling (after complex formation) states. Before binding, the Sema6A
ectodomain was in the expected face-to-face homodimer arrangement,
similar to that adopted by Sema3A (603961) and Sema4D, whereas PlxnA2
was in an unexpected head-on homodimer arrangement. In contrast, the
structure of the Sema6A-PlxnA2 signaling complex revealed a 2:2
heterotetramer in which the 2 Plxn2A monomers dissociated from one
another and docked onto the top face of the Sema6A homodimer using the
same interface as the head-on homodimer, indicating that plexins undergo
'partner exchange.' Cell-based activity measurements using mutant
ligands/receptors confirmed that the Sema6A face-to-face dimer
arrangement is physiologically relevant and is maintained throughout
signaling events. Nogi et al. (2010) concluded that
homodimer-to-heterodimer transitions of cell-surface plexin that result
in a specific orientation of its molecular axis relative to the membrane
may constitute the structural mechanism by which the ligand-binding
signal is transmitted to the cytoplasmic region, inducing GAP domain
rearrangements and activation.

MAPPING

By analysis of a panel of human/hamster somatic cell hybrids, Maestrini
et al. (1996) mapped the OCT gene to chromosome 1. Gross (2011) mapped
the PLXNA2 gene to chromosome 1q32.2 based on an alignment of the PLXNA2
sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC136530) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

NOMENCLATURE

Tamagnone et al. (1999) proposed a novel nomenclature for the genes of
the plexin family, which they grouped into the A, B, C, and D
subfamilies; the PLXN2 gene was renamed plexin A2 by them.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mossy fibers are the last hippocampal afferents to invade CA3, and in
mouse, they do so around the time of birth. Suto et al. (2007) showed
that plexin-A2 deletion in mice caused a shift of mossy fibers from the
suprapyramidal region to the infra- and intrapyramidal regions. In
plexin-A2 -/- plexin-A4 -/- double-knockout mice, mossy fibers were
widely distributed within CA3 in a pattern similar to that seen in
plexin-A4 -/- mice, suggesting that plexin-A4 has a predominant role in
the laminar projection of mossy fibers. Mossy fiber synapses formed
normally and were functional in plexin-A2 -/- mice.

;;POTASSIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-GATED, ETHER-A-GO-GO-RELATED SUBFAMILY,

BRAIN-SPECIFIC EAG-LIKE CHANNEL 1; BEC1
DESCRIPTION Voltage-gated potassium channels play an essential role in controlling
cellular excitability in the nervous system by regulating a variety of
neuronal properties, such as interspike membrane potential, action
potential waveform, and firing frequency. These channels constitute an
evolutionarily related superfamily that can be classified into 2 groups,
the Shaker family and the ether-a-go-go (eag) family. The eag family
includes Drosophila eag, human EAG (KCNH1; 603305), rat Eag, Drosophila
eag-related gene (erg), human ERG (KCNH2; 152427), and rat Elk. Members
of the eag family are related to cyclic nucleotide-gated cation
channels, hyperpolarization-activated cation channels, and plant
hyperpolarization-activated potassium channels. A common feature of the
C terminus of eag-type channels is a putative cyclic nucleotide-binding
(CNB) domain. By searching an EST database using the amino acid sequence
of human ERG as the query, Miyake et al. (1999) identified ESTs encoding
KCNH3, which they named BEC1. They isolated a cDNA containing the entire
KCNH3 coding sequence. The predicted 1,083-amino acid KCNH3 protein has
6 transmembrane domains, the pore region of voltage-gated potassium
channels, a CNB domain, and putative N-glycosylation sites. KCNH3 shares
95% amino acid sequence identity with rat Kcnh3, 48% identity with human
BEC2 (KCNH4; 604528), 46% identity with rat Elk, 33% similarity with
human ERG, and 30% similarity with rat Eag. The authors concluded that
KCNH3, BEC2, and Elk form a subfamily within the eag family. Expression
of recombinant KCNH3 in mammalian cells induced a voltage-gated outward
current with a fast inactivation component. This current was insensitive
to tetraethylammonium and quinidine. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected a major 4-kb KCNH3 transcript in brain; KCNH3
expression was not found in any other tissue examined. Within brain,
KCNH3 was expressed in cortical structures, such as the cerebral cortex,
amygdala, and hippocampus, and in the striatal regions, including the
putamen and caudate nucleus. KCNH3 expression was not detected in the
spinal cord or in the corpus callosum, which contains primarily axons
and glia. Thus, Miyake et al. (1999) concluded that KCNH3 expression is
largely restricted to the telencephalon. In situ hybridization of rat
brain sections showed prominent expression of Kcnh3 in the hippocampus,
mainly in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell body layers and in the granule
cell layers of the dentate gyrus. In the cerebral cortex, Kcnh3 was
widely expressed from layer II to layer VI, with specific expression in
cell bodies of neurons with typical pyramidal shapes. Miyake et al.
(1999) suggested that KCNH3 is involved in cellular excitability of
restricted neurons in the human central nervous system.

Miyake et al. (1999) noted that the KCNH3 gene overlaps a sequence,
DRES61, that was mapped to 12q13 by Banfi et al. (1996) using FISH.

Ogryzko et al. (1998) identified the human polypeptide PAF65A as a
subunit of the PCAF complex (see 602303). PAF65A shows sequence
similarity to human TAFII80 (602955). The predicted 622-amino acid

FGFR1OP2/FGFR1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Grand et al. (2004) identified the FGFR1OP2 gene through its involvement
in a fusion with the FGFR1 gene (136350). By 5-prime RACE of the fusion
transcript, followed by RT-PCR and genomic database analysis, they
identified full-length FGFR1OP2. The deduced 253-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 29 kD and contains 4 potential
coiled-coil domains. Microarray data indicated that FGFR1OP2 is
expressed in diverse tissues, including bone marrow, spleen, and thymus.
FGFR1OP2 is highly conserved in evolution, sharing 99% and 98% amino
acid identity with its mouse and rat homologs, respectively. FGFR1OP2
homologs are also present in frog and insect genomes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Grand et al. (2004) determined that the FGR1OP2 gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Grand et al. (2004) mapped the FGFR1OP2
gene to chromosome 12p11.

- FGFR1OP2/FGFR1 Fusion Gene

Grand et al. (2004) identified a (12;8)(p11;p11p22) insertion in a
75-year-old male who presented with a T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma that
progressed rapidly to acute myelogenous leukemia. An obvious chronic
myeloproliferative disease was not apparent during the course of his
disease, but the clinical picture fit the overall pattern seen in
patients with 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome (613523). In addition to
the insertion, bone marrow cytogenetics following development of AML
revealed loss of 1 copy of chromosome 7 in all cells analyzed. The
patient also showed mild eosinophilia with infiltration of the affected
lymph node and bone marrow by atypical eosinophils. Grand et al. (2004)
determined that the ins(12;8)(p11;p11p22) resulted in an in-frame fusion
of exon 4 of the FGFR1OP2 gene to exon 9 of the FGFR1 gene. The chimeric
protein contains 526 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of
60 kD. FGFR1OP2-FGFR1 has the first 2 coiled-coil domains of FGFR1OP2
fused to the entire tyrosine kinase domain and part of the juxtamembrane
region of FGFR1. Reciprocal FGFR1-FGFR1OP2 transcripts were not
detected. Since the direction of FGFR1OP2 transcription is in the
opposite orientation to the direction of FGFR1 transcription, an
inversion must have taken place in the formation of the chimeric gene.

;;HUMAN ENHANCER OF INVASION 10; HEI10;;
CHROMOSOME 14 OPEN READING FRAME 18; C14ORF18
HEI10/HMGIC FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HEI10 is a member of the E3 ubiquitin ligase family and functions in
progression of the cell cycle through G(2)/M.

CLONING

By screening a HeLa cell cDNA library for enhancement of invasive
filamentous growth of yeast, Toby et al. (2003) identified a partial
cDNA for HEI10 (human enhancer of invasion-10). By database mining, they
assembled a full-length cDNA, which encodes a deduced 277-amino acid
protein with a predicted molecular mass of 32 kD. The protein contains a
divergent RING finger motif in the N terminus, a coiled-coil domain, and
cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation sites in the C
terminus. Northern blot analysis identified a 1.6-kb HEI10 transcript
that was expressed at high levels in heart, moderate levels in kidney
and liver, and low levels in placenta, brain, and lung. Toby et al.
(2003) noted that the 87% sequence identity shared by the human and
mouse HEI10 orthologs is slightly higher than the average identified by
Makatowski et al. (1996).

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Toby et al. (2003) demonstrated the
interaction of HEI10 with cyclin B1 (123836) and the E2
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH7 (603721). Deletion constructs showed
that the RING finger domain is required for induction of filamentous
growth. Immunofluorescence analysis of human cell lines using an HEI10
antibody showed nuclear localization of HEI10, with strong expression
during cellular growth and chromosomal association during mitosis. HEI10
expression in Xenopus oocytes showed that HEI10 acts as an E3 ubiquitin
ligase, causing delayed entry into mitosis by reducing cyclin B levels.
In vitro, the cyclin B-cdc2 complex phosphorylated HEI10 primarily at
the NTPVR cell cycle kinase consensus site.

GENE STRUCTURE

Toby et al. (2003) determined that the HEI10 gene contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

Band 12q15 is often rearranged in benign mesenchymal tumors such as
uterine leiomyomas (150699), and the HMGIC gene (600698) is present in
that region. Mine et al. (2001) identified HEI10 as a fusion partner
with HMGIC in a uterine leiomyoma. Radiation hybrid mapping demonstrated
that the normal location of HEI10 is 14q11. In the fusion transcript,
the first 2 exons of the HMGIC gene, which encode DNA-binding domains,
were fused in the 3-prime portion of the HEI10 gene.

By genomic sequence analysis, Toby et al. (2003) mapped the HEI10 gene
to chromosome 14q11.1.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Milstien et al. (1996) purified and characterized a protein in rat that
bound to GTP cyclohydrolase I (600225) and exhibited
tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent inhibition of that enzyme. They found that
this regulatory protein, which they termed GFRP, consists of a homodimer
of 9.5-kD subunits and has a molecular mass of 20 kD. Milstien et al.
(1996) used peptide sequences to clone the corresponding rat cDNA which
encodes an 84-amino acid polypeptide. Northern blot analysis of rat
tissues revealed that a 0.8-kb GFRP transcript was expressed at
relatively high levels in liver and kidney and at somewhat lower levels
in testis, heart, brain, and lung. Milstien et al. (1996) suggested that
GFRP may play a role in regulating phenylalanine metabolism in the liver
and in the production of biogenic amine neurotransmitters and nitric
oxide.

602647	TITLE *602647 NUCLEAR RNA EXPORT FACTOR 1; NXF1
;;TIP-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; TAP;;
MEX67, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; MEX67
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Segref et al. (1997) identified a yeast gene, MEX67, that encodes a
factor essential for nuclear mRNA export. The Mex67 protein is found at
the nuclear pores, can be UV-crosslinked to polyadenylated RNA, and
interacts with a putative RNA-binding protein in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen. Thus, Segref et al. (1997) suggested that the Mex67 protein
participates directly in the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm. They reported that the Mex67 protein is homologous to the
human 'tip-associated protein' (TAP).

The 'tyrosine kinase-interacting protein' (Tip) of herpesvirus saimiri
blocks LCK (153390)-mediated signal transduction and is essential for
primary T cell immortalization and for lymphoma induction in vivo. Using
the yeast 2-hybrid system to identify factors that associate with Tip,
Yoon et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA encoding 'tip-associated protein'
(TAP). The predicted 560-amino acid TAP protein migrates as a 65-kD
protein by SDS-PAGE. Northern blot analysis indicated that TAP was
expressed as 2.5- and 4.4-kb mRNAs in all tissues tested. Expression of
Tip and TAP in Jurkat-T cells induced cell aggregation, which was likely
caused by the upregulated surface expression of lymphocyte adhesion
molecules, and NF-kappa-B (164011, 164012) activity. Therefore, Yoon et
al. (1997) suggested that TAP is an important cellular mediator of Tip
function in T-cell transformation by herpesvirus saimiri.

GENE FUNCTION

Gruter et al. (1998) reported the identification of TAP as the cellular
factor that specifically binds to the CTE (constitutive transport
element) of the type D retroviruses. Microinjection experiments
performed in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated that TAP directly stimulates
CTE-dependent export. Furthermore, TAP overcomes the mRNA export block
caused by the presence of saturating amounts of CTE RNA. Thus, TAP, like
its yeast homolog Mex67, is an mRNA nuclear export mediator. TAP is
therefore a cellular RNA binding protein that is directly involved in
the export of its target RNA.

Using binding analysis, Herold et al. (2000) showed that NXF1, NXF2
(300315), and NXF3 (300316) interact with E1BAP5 (605800), as well as
with NXT1 (605811) and NXT2 (300320). The RBDs of NXF1 and NXF2, but not
that of NXF3, were found to bind RNA. Only NXF1, however, could promote
RNA export mediated by the constitutive transport element of simian type
D retrovirus. Both NXF1 and NXF2, but not NXF3, through their C-terminal
NWD loop, could bind to the nucleoporins CAN (NUP214; 114350), NUP153
(603948), and NUP62 (605815). Only NXF1 could bind to NUP98 (601021).
CAT reporter and Western blot assays showed that coexpression of NXF1 or
NXF2, but not NXF3, with NXT1 or NXT2 activated CAT expression,
suggesting that under these conditions NXF1 can also stimulate RNA
export. The LRRs and NTF2 (605813)-like domains are required for export
activity.

Shamsher et al. (2002) found that transportin-2 (603002) forms complexes
with TAP that strictly depend on the presence of RanGTP. The data
supported the conclusion that transportin-2 participates directly in the
export of a large proportion of cellular mRNAs, and that TAP connects
transportin-2 to mRNAs to be exported.

Li et al. (2006) showed that the TAP gene contains a functional
constitutive transport element (CTE) in its alternatively spliced intron
10. TAP mRNA containing this intron is exported to the cytoplasm and is
present in polyribosomes. A small TAP protein is encoded by this mRNA
and can be detected in human and monkey cells. Li et al. (2006)
concluded that TAP regulates expression of its own intron-containing RNA
through a CTE-mediated mechanism, and that CTEs are likely to be
important elements that facilitate efficient expression of mammalian
mRNAs with retained introns.

FMRP (FMR1; 309550) is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling RNA-binding protein
that participates in mRNA transport and translational control. Using
immunoprecipitation analysis and quantitative real-time RT-PCR, Zhang et
al. (2007) showed that Fmrp and Nxf2 were present in Nxf1
mRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein particles in cultured mouse neuronal
cells. Expression of Nxf2 led to destabilization of Nxf1 mRNA, and this
effect was abolished when Fmrp expression was reduced by small
interfering RNA. Zhang et al. (2007) concluded that FMRP and NXF2
collaborate to destabilize NXF1 mRNA.

MAPPING

Using genomic sequence analysis, Herold et al. (2000) mapped the NXF1
gene to chromosome 11 and determined that it contains at least 21 exons.
Hamilton et al. (1997) mapped the Mvb1 locus to proximal mouse
chromosome 19.

Windpassinger et al. (2003) observed that Human Genome Project sequence
data indicated that the NXF1 gene is located on 11q12-q14, the region to
which the locus for Silver spastic paraplegia syndrome (270685) had been
mapped. They excluded NXF1 as the mutant gene, as no mutations were
found on sequence analysis of at least 2 affected individuals from each
of 4 different families and 1 healthy control.

ANIMAL MODEL

In mice, the modifier-of-vibrator-1 locus (Mvb1) controls levels of
correctly processed mRNA from genes mutated by endogenous retrovirus
insertions into introns, including the Pitpn(vb) (600174) tremor
mutation and the Eya1(BOR) (601653) model of human branchiootorenal
syndrome. By positional complementation cloning, Floyd et al. (2003)
identified Mvb1 as the nuclear export factor Nxf1, providing an
unexpected link between the mRNA export receptor and pre-mRNA
processing. Population structure of the suppressive allele in wild Mus
musculus castaneus suggested selective advantage.

;;PORPHOBILINOGEN DEAMINASE; PBGD;;
PRE-UROPORPHYRINOGEN SYNTHASE;;
UROPORPHYRINOGEN I SYNTHASE;;
UROPORPHYRINOGEN I SYNTHETASE
DESCRIPTION Porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD; EC 4.3.1.8) is the third enzyme of the
biosynthetic pathway leading to the production of heme. It catalyzes the
synthesis of hydroxymethylbilane by stepwise condensation of 4
porphobilinogen units. Hydroxymethylbilane is then converted to
uroporphyrinogen III by uroporphyrinogen III synthetase (UROS; 606938)
(Raich et al., 1986).

CLONING

Raich et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA clone corresponding to the human
erythrocyte porphobilinogen deaminase gene from a human erythrocyte
library prepared from human spleen. The deduced 334-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of approximately 37.6 kD. Northern blot
analysis identified a single 1.6-kb mRNA transcript.

Grandchamp et al. (1987) determined that there are 2 PBGD isoforms that
differ by approximately 2 kD (40 and 42 kD). One is active in all
tissues and can be isolated from liver, and the other is restricted to
erythrocytes. The nonerythrocyte isoform contains an additional 17 amino
acid residues at the N terminus.

Chretien et al. (1988) demonstrated that the PBGD gene undergoes
alternative splicing with 2 different promoters to yield 2 mRNAs. The
first 'upstream' promoter is active in all tissues and has structural
features of a housekeeping promoter, whereas the second promoter,
located 3 kb downstream, is active only in erythrocytes and shows
structural homology to the beta-globin gene (141900) promoters. The 2
mRNAs differ only in their first exon.

Gubin and Miller (2001) identified 2 alternatively spliced isoforms of
erythroid PBGD in CD34+/- (142230) erythroid precursor cells. Complete
sequencing showed that the alternatively spliced form, designated
PBGD-EA, contained the intron between exons 2 and 3, thus extending the
5-prime untranslated region of the erythroid transcript by 176 bp.
Northern blot analysis identified a distinct 1.5-kb mRNA corresponding
to the alternatively spliced erythrocyte isoform only in bone marrow and
fetal spleen.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chretien et al. (1988) determined that the HMBS gene contains 15 exons
and spans approximately 10 kb of DNA.

The housekeeping HMBS transcript contains exons 1 and 3-15; the
erythroid HMBS transcript is encoded by exons 2-15 (Chen et al., 1994).

MAPPING

By study of mouse-human hybrid clones, Meisler et al. (1980, 1981)
showed that PBG-deaminase is determined by a gene on chromosome 11; Wang
et al. (1981) assigned the locus to the long arm in the segment
11q23-qter. In 3 children with trisomy of 11qter, de Verneuil et al.
(1982) studied expression of uroporphyrinogen I synthase. Dosage effect
supported assignment to the region 11q23.2-qter.

By in situ hybridization and by gene dosage studies in patients with
monosomy or trisomy of the terminal portion of 11q, Namba et al. (1991)
refined the assignment of the PBGD gene to 11q24.1-q24.2.

Tunnacliffe and McGuire (1990) constructed a long-range restriction map
extending over 1.8 Mb of 11q23.3 using pulsed field gel electrophoresis
and concluded that PBGD is situated in the following relation to 5 other
genes: cen--CD3E--CD3D--CD3G--PBGD--CBL2--THY1--qter. They determined
that the CD3G (186740) gene and PBGD are separated by 750 kb.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

By the method of isoelectric focusing, Meisler and Carter (1980)
identified structural variants of PBG-deaminase.

Louie et al. (1992) defined the 3-domain structure of PBGD by x-ray
analysis. Two of the domains structurally resembled the transferrins
(see, e.g., TF; 190000). The x-ray structure and results from
site-directed mutagenesis provided evidence for a single catalytic site.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large Dutch family with the nonerythroid variant of AIP, Grandchamp
et al. (1989) identified a heterozygous splice site mutation in intron 1
of the PBGD gene (609806.0001). The mutation interrupted the sequence
coding for the nonerythroid isoform of PBGD; thus, expression of the
erythroid isoform was unaffected. In a patient with CRM-positive AIP,
Grandchamp et al. (1989) identified a mutation in the HMBS gene,
resulting in the skipping of exon 12 (609806.0002).

In affected members of 11 different families with either CRM-negative or
CRM-positive AIP, Grandchamp et al. (1990) identified 7 different point
mutations in the PBGD gene.

In a patient with the nonerythroid variant of AIP, Chen et al. (1994)
identified a mutation in the initiation codon of the housekeeping HMBS
isoform (M1V; 609806.0044). Puy et al. (1998) identified 3 different
mutations in the donor splice site of the HMBS gene in 4 unrelated
patients with the nonerythroid variant of AIP. They found that the
splice site mutations resulted in activation of a cryptic splice site
located 67 nucleotides downstream from the normal splice site, leading
to a frameshift and premature stop codon in exon 4.

In 28 Finnish families representing 72% of all AIP families in the
Finnish population of 5 million, Kauppinen et al. (1995) found 19
separate mutations in HMBS: 13 novel mutations, including 1 de novo
event, and 6 previously characterized mutations.

Whatley et al. (1999) found 39 different mutations in the HMBS gene in
54 of 57 consecutive patients with AIP.

In patients with the nonerythroid variant of AIP, Whatley et al. (2000)
identified mutations in the housekeeping promoter (-154delG;
609806.0041) and in exon 3 (41delA; 609806.0042) of the HMBS gene.

Floderus et al. (2002) studied most of the AIP kindreds in Sweden. They
identified 27 novel mutations in the HMBS gene, bringing the total
number of known mutations in the HMBS gene in Sweden to 39. Most of the
mutations were located in exons 10 and 12, with fewer in exon 7.
Floderus et al. (2002) used the 3-dimensional structure of the
porphobilinogen deaminase enzyme to predict the possible molecular and
functional consequences of the novel Swedish missense and nonsense
mutations.

In a patient with AIP, Hessels et al. (2004) detected a novel homozygous
leu81-to-pro (L81P) mutation in exon 6 of the HMBS gene (609806.0045).
Porphobilinogen deaminase activity in red cells was decreased to 2 to
4%.

ANIMAL MODEL

Clavero et al. (2010) described a naturally occurring feline model of
AIP in 4 unrelated cat lines that presented phenotypically as congenital
erythropoietic porphyria (CEP; 263700). Affected cats had erythrodontia,
brownish urine, fluorescent bones, and markedly elevated urinary
uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin, consistent with CEP. However, their
UROS activities (deficient in CEP) were normal. Notably, affected cats
had half-normal HMBS activities and elevated urinary 5-aminolevulinic
acid and porphobilinogen. Sequencing the feline Hmbs gene revealed
different mutations in each line, including a duplication, an in-frame
3-bp deletion (842delGAG), and 2 missense (A84T and R149W) mutations.
The 842delGAG and R149W mutations were identical to mutations reported
in human. Prokaryotic expression of the 842delGAG and R149W mutations
resulted in mutant enzymes with less than 1% wildtype activity, whereas
the A84T mutation expressed a stable enzyme with approximately 35% of
wildtype activity. The discolored teeth from the affected cats contained
markedly elevated URO I and III, accounting for the CEP-like phenocopy.
In 3 lines, the phenotype was an autosomal dominant trait, while
affected cats with the A84T mutation were homozygous, a unique recessive
form of AIP.

PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT, NONERYTHROID VARIANT
HMBS, IVS1DS, G-A, +1

In affected members of a large Dutch family with the nonerythroid
variant of acute intermittent porphyria (176000), Grandchamp et al.
(1989) identified a G-to-A transition in the 5-prime splice donor site
of intron 1 of the HMBS gene. The mutation interrupted the sequence
coding for the nonerythroid isoform of PBGD; thus, expression of the
erythroid isoform was unaffected. Hybridization analysis using
oligonucleotide probes after in vitro amplification of genomic DNA
offered another possibility of detecting asymptomatic carriers of the
mutation in affected families.

Puy et al. (1997, 1998) identified this splice site mutation in patients
with nonerythroid variant AIP.

Petrides (1998) identified the G-to-A transition in intron 1 of the HMBS
gene in 9 members of a German kindred in which the proband had a
life-threatening coma due to the nonerythroid variant of AIP. The newly
identified family members were taught how to prevent porphyric attacks.

PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, EX12DEL

In a patient with acute intermittent porphyria (176000), Grandchamp et
al. (1989) identified a G-to-A transition in exon 12 of the HMBS gene,
resulting in the skipping of exon 12. The resulting aberrant mRNA
encoded a truncated protein that was inactive, but stable, and could be
detected using antibodies directed against the normal enzyme
(CRM-positive).

.0003
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT, NONERYTHROID VARIANT
HMBS, IVS1DS, G-T, +1

In a Finnish family with the nonerythroid variant of acute intermittent
porphyria (176000) Grandchamp et al. (1989) identified a G-to-T
transversion in the 5-prime splice donor sequence of intron 1 of the
HMBS gene. This is only 1 nucleotide removed from the mutation listed as
609806.0001, in which the change occurred in the first nucleotide of
intron 1. Grandchamp et al. (1989) proposed that both of these mutations
resulted in an abnormal splicing of primary transcripts initiated at the
upstream promoter of the gene without affecting the expression of the
PBGD gene in erythroid cells where the downstream promoter is utilized.
A similar mutation located at the last position of exon 1 of the
beta-globin gene was found by Vidaud et al. (1989) to be responsible for
a splicing defect leading to beta-thalassemia.

HMBS, ARG116TRP

In affected members of a Swedish family with AIP (176000), Lee et al.
(1990) identified a C-to-T transition in exon 8 of the HMBS gene,
resulting in an arg116-to-trp (R116W) substitution.

The R116W mutation was found by Gu et al. (1993) in 15 Dutch AIP
families and in 1 French AIP family.

(R167Q) substitution.

In a brother and sister with severe AIP (176000), Llewellyn et al.
(1992) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PBGD
gene: a 500G-A transition, resulting in an R167Q substitution, and a
499C-T transition, resulting in an R167W substitution (609806.0013). The
mutations occurred in adjacent nucleotides.

Finnish families with CRM-positive AIP.

HMBS, 1-BP DEL, 900T

In a patient with CRM-positive AIP (176000), Delfau et al. (1991)
identified a 1-bp deletion (900delT) in exon 1 of the HMBS gene,
resulting in a stop codon located 15 codons downstream from the
deletion.

.0011
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, 9-BP DEL, EX10

In a patient with CRM-positive AIP (176000), Delfau et al. (1991)
identified a deletion of the last 9 bp of exon 10. This resulted from
abnormal splicing of intron 10 which was a consequence of a G-to-T
substitution of the last base of exon 10.

.0012
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, TRP198TER

In affected members of a northern Swedish (Lappland) family with AIP
(176000), Lee and Anvret (1991) identified a G-to-A transition in exon
10 of the HMBS gene, resulting in a trp198-to-ter (W198X) substitution.
The same mutation was found in 15 of 33 Swedish AIP families. Genealogic
data showed that 12 of the 15 were related, indicating a founder effect.

.0013
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, ARG167TRP

In a brother and sister with severe AIP (176000), Llewellyn et al.
(1992) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PBGD
gene: a 499C-T transition, resulting in an arg167-to-trp (R167W)
substitution, and an adjacent 500G-A transition, resulting in an R167Q
(609806.0005) substitution.

The seemingly high frequency of mutations in exon 10 (Delfau et al.,
1990) prompted Gu et al. (1992) to screen this exon in 41 unrelated AIP
patients by use of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) after
PCR amplification. In about one-fourth of the patients, they
distinguished 3 abnormal migration patterns, indicating the presence of
mutation in heterozygous state. Sequencing demonstrated the presence of
3 different single-base substitutions: R167Q, R173Q (609806.0006), and
R167W.

In Finland, Kauppinen et al. (1992) found an R167W mutation in 3 out of
7 families with CRM-positive AIP. DNA analyses of family members
demonstrated that conventional assays of erythrocyte PBGD activity
identified correctly only 72% of the carriers of the mutation.

Solis et al. (2004) reported a Spanish AIP patient who was homozygous
for the R167W substitution. Both parents were heterozygous for the
mutation. The patient had a severe course, with psychomotor delay,
dystonic movements, axial hypotonia, delayed myelination, and death at
age 40 months.

Solis et al. (2004) noted that the R167W, R173Q, and R167Q mutations all
occur at CpG dinucleotides within exon 10, and can thus be considered
mutation hotspots. All 3 substitutions alter highly conserved arginines
in the enzyme's active site, which interact with the precursor
porphobilinogen and the acidic side chains of the enzyme's
dipyrromethane cofactor. Functional expression studies showed that all 3
substitutions resulted in less than 2% normal HMBS activity.

.0014
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, ARG167LEU

Using site-directed mutagenesis, Lander et al. (1991) demonstrated that
an arg167-to-leu (R167L) substitution in the HMBS protein resulted in a
profound decrease of PBGD activity, consistent with AIP (176000). It is
noteworthy that substitution of arg167 by glutamine (R167Q; 609806.0005)
and by tryptophan (R167W; 609806.0013) resulted in loss of enzyme
activity.

Nearly 60% of all Swiss AIP patients carry the W283X mutation. In
France, the prevalence of W283X is less than 5% (Schneider-Yin et al.,
2002). In 12 of 25 AIP families of Swiss and French origin,
Schneider-Yin et al. (2002) identified a common haplotype containing the

In a patient with the nonerythroid variant of AIP (176000), Chen et al.
(1994) identified a heterozygous 3G-A transition in exon 1 of the HMBS

was decreased to 2 to 4%. Both parents were heterozygous and
asymptomatic. Leu81 in PBG deaminase is an evolutionarily conserved

Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous R149X
substitution in affected members of the original family with so-called
'Chester type porphyria' (McColl et al., 1985) (see 176000). The
mutation was not found in 200 control chromosomes. The family had
originally been reported as having features of both AIP and variegated
porphyria (VP; 176200), but no mutations in the PPOX gene (600923) were
identified. The mutation occurred at a hypermutable CpG dinucleotide.
The findings confirmed that Chester type porphyria is a variant of AIP.
Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2006) suggested that the original biochemical
studies indicating PPOX deficiency may have been erroneous or
misinterpreted. A different mutation in this codon has also been
associated with AIP (R149Q; 609806.0008).

604634	TITLE *604634 TRANSGELIN 2; TAGLN2
DESCRIPTION By sequencing cDNAs randomly selected from a cDNA library derived from a
human immature myeloid cell line, Nagase et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA
encoding TAGLN2, which they called KIAA0120. The deduced 199-amino acid
TAGLN2 protein shares 69.7% amino acid sequence identity with rat
neuronal protein NP25 (607953) over 195 amino acids. Northern blot
analysis detected TAGLN2 expression in all 16 human tissues examined,
with high expression in lung, liver, kidney, spleen, thymus, small
intestine, colon, prostate, testis, ovary, placenta, and peripheral
blood leukocytes, lower expression in skeletal muscle, pancreas, and
heart, and lowest expression in brain.

Stanier et al. (1998) cloned mouse Tagln2 cDNAs. They found that mouse
and human TAGLN2 share 95% amino acid sequence identity.

Using a somatic cell hybrid mapping panel, Nagase et al. (1995)
determined that the TAGLN2 gene maps to either chromosome 1 or 8.
Stanier et al. (1998) noted that an EST cluster representing the TAGLN2
gene had been mapped to 1q21-q25. By linkage analysis, Stanier et al.
(1998) mapped the mouse Tagln2 gene to distal chromosome 1, between the
Fcgr2 gene (146790) and marker D1Mit149. Distal mouse chromosome 1 shows
homology of synteny with human 1q21-q25.

148070	TITLE *148070 KERATIN 18; KRT18
;;K18;;
CYTOKERATIN 18; CYK18
DESCRIPTION Intermediate filaments (IFs) are a structurally related family of
cellular proteins that appear to be intimately involved with the
cytoskeleton. The common structural motif shared by all IFs is a central
alpha-helical 'rod domain' flanked by variable N- and C-terminal
domains. The rod domain, the canonical feature of IFs, has been highly
conserved during evolution. The variable terminals, however, have
allowed the known IFs to be classified into 6 distinct types by virtue
of their differing amino acid sequences (Steinert and Roop, 1988).
Keratins compose types I and II; intermediate filaments desmin,
vimentin, GFAP, and peripherin, type III; neurofilaments, type IV, and
nuclear lamins, type V. Nestin (600915) has been classed as type VI
(Lendahl et al., 1990). The acidic keratins are coded by genes KRT9
(607606) to KRT19 (148020). These genes are located on mouse chromosome
11 and human chromosome 17, except for KRT18 which may be located on
human chromosome 12 (see later). The basic keratins are coded by genes
KRT1 (139350) to KRT8 (148060), which are located on mouse chromosome 15
and human chromosome 12.

Human keratin 18 and the homologous mouse Endo B are type I IF protein
subunits whose expression is restricted in adults to a variety of simple
epithelial tissues. Endo B and its coexpressed type II keratin, Endo A
(the mouse equivalent of human keratin 8), appear to be the first IF
proteins expressed during murine development. Type I and type II
keratins are usually expressed as preferential pairs in equal
proportions in cells, although filaments can be formed in vitro from
heterologous IF subunits. KRT18 is the most divergent of the type I
keratins with N-terminal and C-terminal domains that are quite different
from those of epidermal keratins. According to Kulesh and Oshima (1989),
the genes that code for 12 diverse IF proteins had been cloned and
characterized. Kulesh and Oshima (1989) isolated the human KRT18 gene as
a 10-kb fragment of genomic DNA. Following transfection, the gene was
expressed in several different mouse cell lines including nonepithelial
cells that do not express the homologous endogenous Endo-B gene. The
KRT18 gene is 3,791 bp long and the keratin 18 protein is coded for by 7
exons. The exon structure of KRT18 has been conserved compared to that
of other keratin genes, with the exception of a single 3-prime terminal
exon that codes for the tail domain of the protein that is represented
by 2 exons in epidermal keratins. Waseem et al. (1990) used
human-specific primers from within introns of the published gene
sequence for human type I keratin 18 and PCR to amplify this gene
specifically. By Southern blotting using the genomic DNA PCR product,
they assigned the gene for keratin 18 to chromosome 12. Other human type
I keratins have been assigned to chromosome 17. Waseem et al. (1990)
suggested that the findings indicate the early divergence of the genes
for stratifying cell keratins from that of simple, or embryonic, keratin
18.

By in situ hybridization, Heath et al. (1990) localized a human
cytokeratin 18 cDNA sequence to 17p12-p11. They presented the findings
as evidence for a clustering of cytokeratin genes and related sequences
on the p and q arms of chromosome 17. The findings are, however,
inconsistent with those of Waseem et al. (1990).

By analysis of a YAC contig from 12q13, Yoon et al. (1994) demonstrated
that the KRT18 type I keratin gene is located next to its type II
partner, KRT8, in a cluster of type II keratin genes.

Ku et al. (1995) described transgenic mice that express point-mutant K18
and develop chronic hepatitis and hepatocyte fragility in association
with disruption of hepatocyte keratin filaments. They showed that
transgenic mice expressing mutant K18 are highly susceptible to
hepatotoxicity after acute administration of acetaminophen or chronic
ingestion of griseofulvin. The authors concluded that the predisposition
to hepatotoxicity results directly from the keratin mutation since
nontransgenic or transgenic mice that express normal human K18 are more
resistant. Hepatotoxicity was manifested by a significant difference in
lethality, liver histopathology, and biochemical serum testing. Keratin
glycosylation decreased in all griseofulvin-fed mice, whereas keratin
phosphorylation increased dramatically preferentially in mice expressing
normal K18. The phosphorylation increase in normal K18 after
griseofulvin feeding appeared to involve sites that are different from
those that increased after partial hepatectomy. Ku et al. (1996) stated
that this dramatic phosphorylation increase in nonmutant keratins could
provide survival advantage to hepatocytes. Although the potential for
K18 mutations to cause human disease remain to be investigated, they
considered it possible that K8/18 mutations may not directly cause
disease but may predispose to it; for example, mutations may confer
susceptibility to liver disease upon exposure to an environmental factor
such as a virus or hepatotoxin.

Although mutations had been described in 11 of the more than 20 keratin
intermediate filaments (as the basis of epidermal and oral disorders),
no disease-associated mutations had been described in keratin 8 (KRT8;
148060) or KRT18 until the report by Ku et al. (1997). K8/18 is the
major keratin pair in epithelia of the type found in liver, pancreas,
and intestine. Transgenic mice that express mutant keratin 18, as
already noted, develop chronic hepatitis, and have an increased
susceptibility to drug-induced hepatotoxicity. By studying patients with
liver disease of unknown cause for mutations in KRT18, Ku et al. (1997)
described a his127leu (H127L) KRT mutation in a patient with cryptogenic
cirrhosis (see 215600) that was germline transmitted (148070.0001). The
mutant KRT18 isolated from the liver explant, or after expression in
bacteria, showed an altered migration on 2-dimensional gel analysis as
compared with normal human liver or bacterially expressed KRT18.
Electron microscopy of in vitro assembled mutant KRT18 and wildtype KRT8
showed an assembly defect as compared with normal KRT8/18 assembly. The
results suggested that mutations in KRT18 predispose to cryptogenic
cirrhosis in humans.

Among 120 patients with cirrhosis of undetermined cause (see 215600), Ku
et al. (1997) found 1 patient with a heterozygous A-to-T transversion in
the KRT18 gene that resulted in a his127-to-leu substitution. The
mutation was germline since sequencing of amplified genomic DNA,
isolated from a blood sample of the daughter of the patient, showed the
same H127L mutation in heterozygous form.

Ku et al. (2003) found a his127-to-leu mutation in noncryptogenic
cirrhosis and concluded that the mutation functions as a susceptibility
gene.

609752	TITLE *609752 NUCLEAR RECEPTOR COACTIVATOR 7; NCOA7
;;ERAP140
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By Far Western screening of a lymphoma cell cDNA library for estrogen
receptor-alpha (ESR1; 133430)-associated factors, Shao et al. (2002)
identified a novel cDNA, nuclear receptor coactivator-7. NCOA7 encodes a
942-amino acid protein, which the authors called ERAP140 (estrogen
receptor-associated protein of 140 kD). Northern blot analysis revealed
an approximately 5.5-kb transcript in all tumor lines examined,
including ESR-positive and ESR-negative breast cancer cell lines and
HeLa cells. Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues revealed
highest expression in brain, with lower expression in mammary gland,
ovary, uterus, prostate, stomach, bladder, spinal cord, and pancreas. In
situ hybridization in mouse tissues demonstrated exclusive expression in
neurons in brain and significant expression in the cortex but not in the
medulla in kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Using GST pull-down assays, Shao et al. (2002) found that NCOA7
demonstrated a low level of ligand-dependent constitutive binding to
ESR1, ESR2 (see 601663), THRB (190160), PPARG (601487), and RARA
(180240). Binding was further induced by the presence of ligands. NCOA7
did not bind to RXRA (180245) in the presence or absence of ligand.
NCOA7 can enhance the transcriptional activity of the nuclear receptors
with which it interacts.

Shao et al. (2002) found that NCOA7 differs from other nuclear receptor
coactivators in that it does not contain an LXXLL receptor-coactivator
interaction motif. Instead it contains a central domain between amino
acids 489 and 559 that mediates ESR1 binding. A leucine at position 523
and/or an isoleucine at position 524 appeared to be essential for the
interaction, and the binding surface appeared to be similar to that of
other coactivators.

GENE STRUCTURE

Shao et al. (2002) demonstrated that the NCOA7 gene contains 15 exons
and spans about 150 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Shao et al. (2002) mapped the NCOA7 gene to
chromosome 6q22.33.

608729	TITLE *608729 ANGIOTENSIN II RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; AGTRAP
;;ATRAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the C-terminal domain of murine At2r1a (106165) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen, Daviet et al. (1999) cloned mouse Agtrap from a kidney
cDNA library. The deduced 161-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 17.8 kD. It contains several extensive N-terminal
hydrophobic domains, as well as potential sites for phosphorylation and
N-glycosylation. Northern blot analysis detected transcripts of 1.2 and
0.8 kb in all mouse tissues examined, with relatively high levels in
kidney, testis, and heart. PCR also detected Agtrap expression in mouse
aortic tissue and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).

By sequencing clones obtained from a fetal brain cDNA library, followed
by EST database analysis, Wang et al. (2002) cloned human AGTRAP. The
deduced 159-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 17.3
kD. AGTRAP has a 21-amino acid N-terminal transmembrane region that is
followed by a conserved cysteine, which is potentially palmitoylated.
Mouse and human AGTRAP share 74% amino acid homology. Northern blot
analysis detected a 1.2-kb transcript in almost all tissues examined,
with highest abundance in kidney, heart, pancreas, and thyroid.

GENE FUNCTION

By affinity chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Daviet
et al. (1999) confirmed association between mouse Agtrap and At2r1a.
Agtrap interacted specifically with the C-terminal domain of At2r1a, but
not with the C-terminal domains of several other hormone receptors,
including AT2R2 (300034), CHRM3 (118494), BDKRB2 (113503), EDNRB
(131244), and ADRB2 (109690). Overexpression of Agtrap in COS-7 cells
inhibited At2r1a activation of phospholipase C (see 607120). It did not
affect Chrm3 activation.

Cui et al. (2000) determined that transfection of mouse Agtrap into
adult rat VSMCs potentiated At2r1 internalization upon angiotensin II
(see 106150) stimulation. Receptor-induced DNA synthesis was inhibited
in Agtrap-transfected VSMCs, and this was associated with inhibition of
Stat3 (102582) and Akt (see 164730) phosphorylation. Cui et al. (2000)
concluded that AGTRAP is a negative regulator of AT2R1-mediated cell
proliferation in VSMCs.

Using several assays of protein interaction, Wang et al. (2002) showed
that AGTRAP interacted with RACK1 (176981). They suggested that the
AGTRAP-RACK1 interaction may help recruit the signaling complex to AT2R1
and affect receptor signaling.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Guo et al. (2005) demonstrated that mouse
Caml (CAMLG; 601118) interacted with Atrap. The N-terminal hydrophilic
domain of Caml mediated the interaction, and the proteins colocalized in
the endoplasmic reticulum. Atrap knockdown increased NFAT (see NFATC2;
600490) activity, and overexpression of Atrap decreased angiotensin II-
or Caml-induced NFAT transcriptional activation. Overexpression of the
N-terminal ATRAP-interacting domain of Caml increased angiotensin
II-induced NFAT promoter activity, whereas overexpression of the
C-terminal end of Caml disrupted the effect of angiotensin II on NFAT
signaling.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the AGTRAP
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SHGC-32094).

601447	TITLE *601447 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 5; USP5
;;ISOPEPTIDASE T; ISOT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitin (see 191339)-dependent proteolysis is a complex pathway of
protein metabolism implicated in such diverse cellular functions as
maintenance of chromatin structure, receptor function, and degradation
of abnormal proteins. A late step of the process involves disassembly of
the polyubiquitin chains on degraded proteins into ubiquitin monomers.
USP5 disassembles branched polyubiquitin chains by a sequential exo
mechanism, starting at the proximal end of the chain (Wilkinson et al.,
1995).

CLONING

Wilkinson et al. (1995) purified a 93-kD bovine protein with the
properties expected of a polyubiquitin disassembly protein. They
biochemically characterized the enzyme, which they called isopeptidase T
(ISOT), and cloned a cDNA encoding the human homolog (GenBank U35116).
The deduced 835-amino acid human polypeptide has a predicted molecular
mass of 93.3 kD.

Ansari-Lari et al. (1996) generated the genomic sequence of the human
CD4 gene (186940) and its neighboring region on chromosome 12 using the
large-scale shotgun sequencing strategy. A total of 117 kb of genomic
sequence and approximately 11 kb of cDNA sequence was obtained. They
identified in this sequence 8 genes, including CD4 and ISOT. Using a
battery of strategies, the exon/intron boundaries, splice variants, and
tissue expression patterns of the genes were determined. Tissue
expression analysis indicated a high level of expression of a 3.3-kb
ISOT transcript in brain, and a low level of expression in heart, lung,
spleen, and skeletal muscle. Sequence comparison showed that ISOT is a
member of the ubiquitin C-terminal hydroxylase family. Wilkinson et al.
(1995) originally cloned human ISOT and reported the sequence as 3,102
bp long. Ansari-Lari et al. (1996) stated that comparison of their cDNA
sequence with the sequence reported by Wilkinson et al. (1995) indicated
alternative splicing in exon 15. Four nucleotide differences were found
between the 2 sequences resulting in lys-to-arg and gly-to-asp
substitutions. The cDNA and genomic sequences were in full agreement.

Reyes-Turcu et al. (2006) stated that the 835-amino acid human USP5
protein contains 4 putative ubiquitin-binding domains: an N-terminal
zinc finger ubiquitin-binding domain (ZNF-UBP), a ubiquitin-specific
processing protease (UBP) domain formed by noncontiguous regions
containing the active-site cys and his boxes, and 2 ubiquitin-associated
domains (UBA1 and UBA2). UBA1 and UBA2 are located between the cys and
his boxes, which are in the central and C-terminal regions of USP5,
respectively.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Reyes-Turcu et al. (2006) reported the crystal structures of the ZNF-UBP
domain of USP5 alone and in complex with ubiquitin at 2.09-angstrom
resolution. They found that, unlike other ubiquitin-binding domains, the
ZNF-UBP domain contains a deep binding pocket where the C-terminal
diglycine motif of ubiquitin is inserted, thus explaining the
specificity of USP5 for an unmodified C terminus on the proximal subunit
of polyubiquitin. Mutation analysis showed that the ZNF-UBP domain was
required for optimal catalytic activation of USP5.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ansari-Lari et al. (1996) mapped the USP5
gene to chromosome 12p13, near the CD4 gene (186940).

;;TRANS-2-ENOYL-CoA REDUCTASE, MITOCHONDRIAL;;
2-@ENOYL THIOESTER REDUCTASE;;
NUCLEAR RECEPTOR-BINDING FACTOR 1; NRBF1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to S. cerevisiae
trans-2-enoyl thioesterase, followed by PCR amplification, Miinalainen
et al. (2003) cloned NRBF1. The deduced 373-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 37 kD. Homologous proteins were identified
in mammalian, nematode, and yeast databases. The mammalian proteins
contain a putative N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal, and all
contain a tyrosine residue critical for catalysis in the yeast enzyme.
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.4-kb NRBF1 transcript expressed at
highest levels in skeletal and heart muscle. Expression was weaker in
brain, placenta, liver, kidney, and pancreas, and no expression was
detected in lung. SDS-PAGE showed that purified recombinant NRBF1 had an
apparent molecular mass of about 37 kD. Size exclusion chromatography
estimated a native mass of 65 kD, indicating that NRBF1 forms
homodimers.

GENE FUNCTION

Miinalainen et al. (2003) demonstrated that recombinant NRBF1 reduced
trans-2-enoyl-CoA to acyl-CoA with chain lengths from C6 to C16 in an
NADPH-dependent manner, with preference for medium chain-length
substrates. Furthermore, expression of human NRBF1 in a yeast strain
deficient in 2-enoyl thioester reductase restored mitochondrial
respiratory function and allowed growth on glycerol.

GENE STRUCTURE

Miinalainen et al. (2003) determined that the NRBF1 gene contains 10
exons and spans more than 37 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Miinalainen et al. (2003) mapped the NRBF1
gene to chromosome 1p22.3.

613968	TITLE *613968 TASTE RECEPTOR, TYPE 2, MEMBER 60; TAS2R60
;;T2R60
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TAS2R60 belongs to the large TAS2R receptor family. TAS2Rs are expressed
on the surface of taste receptor cells and mediate the perception of
bitterness through a G protein-coupled second messenger pathway (summary
by Conte et al., 2002). For further information on the TAS2R gene
family, see 604791.

CLONING

By screening the human genome for sequences related to TAS2Rs, Conte et
al. (2002) cloned TAS2R60, which they called T2R60. The deduced
318-amino acid protein contains the 7-transmembrane structure and short
N- and C-terminal domains conserved in TAS2Rs. The intracellular domains
share significant conservation with other TAS2R family members. TAS2R60
shares highest sequence similarity with TAS2R41 (613965).

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and genomic sequence analyses, Conte et al.
(2002) mapped the TAS2R60 gene to an approximately 3-Mb cluster on
chromosome 7q.

Gross (2011) mapped the TAS2R60 gene to chromosome 7q35 based on an
alignment of the TAS2R60 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY114094) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

604097	TITLE *604097 UROTENSIN II; UTS2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Coulouarn et al. (1998) clearly established the existence of urotensin
II in mammals by characterizing cDNAs encoding the urotensin II
precursors not only in frog but also in human. In both species, the UTS2
sequence is located at the C-terminal position of the precursor. Human
UTS2 is composed of only 11 amino acid residues, while fish and frog
UTS2 possess 12 and 13 amino acid residues, respectively. The cyclic
region of UTS2, which is responsible for the biologic activity of the
peptide, has been fully conserved from fish to human. Northern blot and
dot blot analysis showed that UTS2 precursor mRNAs are found
predominantly in the frog and human spinal cord. In situ hybridization
studies showed that the UTS2 precursor gene is actively expressed in
motoneurons. The fact that evolutionary pressure has acted to conserve
fully the biologically active sequence of UTS2 suggests that the peptide
may exert important physiologic functions in humans.

GENE FUNCTION

Ames et al. (1999) identified a human G protein-coupled receptor, GPR14
(600896), which functions as a urotensin II receptor. Human urotensin II
binds to recombinant human GPR14 with high affinity, and the binding is
functionally coupled to calcium mobilization. Human urotensin II is
found within both vascular and cardiac tissue, including coronary
atheroma, and effectively constricts isolated arteries from nonhuman
primates. The potency of vasoconstriction of urotensin II was an order
of magnitude greater than that of endothelin-1 (131240), making human
urotensin II the most potent mammalian vasoconstrictor identified to
that time. In vivo, human urotensin II markedly increased total
peripheral resistance in anesthetized nonhuman primates, a response
associated with profound cardiac contractile dysfunction. Furthermore,
urotensin II immunoreactivity was found within the central nervous
system and endocrine tissues, suggesting that it may have additional
activities.

UTS2 has several cardiovascular actions, including potent vasoactive,
and cardiac inotropic and hypertropic properties. Douglas et al. (2002)
investigated the degree of expression of UTS2 and its receptor GPR14 in
the myocardium of patients with congestive heart failure. They obtained
specimens of myocardium from the hearts of 19 patients with end-stage
congestive heart failure, 5 patients with early-stage congestive heart
failure, and 8 healthy controls. They found strong expression of UTS2 in
the cardiomyocytes, and to a lesser extent in the vascular smooth muscle
cells, endothelial cells, and inflammatory cells of patients with
end-stage congestive heart failure. There was significantly less UTS2
expression in the myocardium of patients with early-stage congestive
heart failure, and little or no UTS2 expression in the myocardium of
healthy controls. RT-PCR showed increased concentrations of UTS2 and the
presence of urotensin receptor mRNA in the myocardium of patients with
congestive heart failure. Confocal microscopy showed a significant
increase in the binding sites for urotensin in the myocardium of
patients with end-stage congestive heart failure.

GENE FAMILY

The caudal neurosecretory system of teleost fish, which terminates in
the urophysis, exhibits morphofunctional similarities to the
hypothalamoneurohypophyseal complex (Bern et al., 1985). Two major
regulatory peptides have been isolated from urophysial extracts and
chemically characterized. Urotensin I, a 41-amino acid peptide, is
structurally similar to mammalian corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF;
122560) and to the frog skin peptide sauvagine; urotensin II (UTS2) is a
cyclic 12-amino acid peptide that has some sequence similarity, but is
not homologous, to somatostatin-14 (see 182450). The characterization of
UTS2 from the urophysis of various teleost species has shown that the
structure of the C-terminal cyclic hexapeptide has been fully conserved,
while several substitutions have occurred in the N-terminal region of
the molecule. Subsequently it was found that urotensin II-like molecules
are present in distant taxa, from mollusks to amphibians, suggesting
that urotensin-related peptides may also occur in mammals. In support of
this hypothesis, a peptide with a high degree of sequence similarity
with UTS1, called urocortin (UCN; 600945), was characterized in the rat
and human brain. In addition, specific binding sites for urotensin II
were demonstrated in rat blood vessels, and fish urotensin II was found
to exert cardiovascular effects in rat and rabbit. It was also found
that the mouse anococcygeus muscle has special sensitivity to urotensin
II (summary by Coulouarn et al., 1998).

600187	TITLE *600187 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 5A; EIF5A
;;EIF5A1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The eukaryotic initiation factor 5A is an 18-kD protein composed of 154
amino acids. It contains a unique amino acid residue, hypusine, that is
formed posttranslationally via the transfer and hydroxylation of the
butylamino-group from the polyamine spermidine to a lys50 within the
EIF5A protein. Koettnitz et al. (1994) isolated and characterized the
human EIF5A pseudogene. Subsequently, Koettnitz et al. (1995) identified
a genomic clone encoding a functional EIF5A. The authors showed that
this sequence could successfully complement yeast carrying the HYP2
mutation (the homolog of EIF5A), whereas the pseudogenes could not.

GENE STRUCTURE

Koettnitz et al. (1995) found that the human EIF5A gene contains at
least 4 exons and spans at least 4.8 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Saini et al. (2009) used molecular genetic and biochemical studies to
show that EIF5A promotes translation elongation. Depletion or
inactivation of EIF5A in the yeast S. cerevisiae resulted in the
accumulation of polysomes and an increase in ribosomal transit times.
Addition of recombinant EIF5A from yeast, but not a derivative lacking
hypusine, enhanced the rate of tripeptide synthesis in vitro. Moreover,
inactivation of EIF5A mimicked the effects of the EEF2 (130610)
inhibitor sordarin, indicating that EIF5A might function together with
EEF2 to promote ribosomal translocation. Because EIF5A is a structural
homolog of the bacterial protein EF-P, Saini et al. (2009) proposed that
EIF5A/EF-P is a universally conserved translation elongation factor.

To identify tumor suppressor genes in lymphoma (605027), Scuoppo et al.
(2012) screened a short hairpin RNA library targeting genes deleted in
human lymphomas and functionally confirmed those in a mouse lymphoma
model. Of the 9 tumor suppressors identified, 8 corresponded to genes
occurring in 3 physically linked 'clusters,' suggesting that the common
occurrence of large chromosomal deletions in human tumors reflects
selective pressure to attenuate multiple genes. Among the newly
identified tumor suppressors were adenosylmethionine decarboxylase-1
(AMD1; 180980) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A),
2 genes associated with hypusine, a unique amino acid produced as a
product of polyamine metabolism through a highly conserved pathway.
Through a secondary screen surveying the impact of all polyamine enzymes
on tumorigenesis, Scuoppo et al. (2012) established the
polyamine-hypusine axis as a new tumor suppressor network regulating
apoptosis. Unexpectedly, heterozygous deletions encompassing AMD1 and
eIF5A often occur together in human lymphomas, and cosuppression of both
genes promotes lymphomagenesis in mice. Thus, Scuoppo et al. (2012)
concluded that some tumor suppressor functions can be disabled through a
2-step process targeting different genes acting in the same pathway.

Translation elongation factor P (EF-P) is critical for virulence in
bacteria. EF-P is present in all bacteria and orthologous to archaeal
and eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (a/eIF5A). Ude et al. (2013)
demonstrated that EF-P is an elongation factor that enhances translation
of polyproline-containing proteins: in the absence of EF-P, ribosomes
stall at polyproline stretches, whereas the presence of EF-P alleviates
the translational stalling. Moreover, Ude et al. (2013) demonstrated the
physiologic relevance of EF-P to fine-tune the expression of the
polyproline-containing pH receptor CadC to levels necessary for an
appropriate stress response. Bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic cells
have hundreds to thousands of polyproline-containing proteins of diverse
function, suggesting that EF-P and a/elF5A are critical for copy number
adjustment of multiple pathways across all kingdoms of life.

Doerfel et al. (2013) showed that EF-P prevents the ribosome from
stalling during synthesis of proteins containing consecutive prolines,
such as PPG, PPP, or longer proline strings, in natural and engineered
model proteins. EF-P promotes peptide-bond formation and stabilizes the
peptidyl-transfer RNA in the catalytic center of the ribosome. EF-P is
posttranslationally modified by a hydroxylated beta-lysine attached to a
lysine residue. The modification enhances the catalytic proficiency of
the factor mainly by increasing its affinity to the ribosome. Doerfel et
al. (2013) proposed that EF-P and its eukaryotic homolog, elF5A, are
essential for the synthesis of a subset of proteins containing proline
stretches in all cells.

MAPPING

Steinkasserer et al. (1995) mapped the EIF5A gene to 17p13-p12 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Three pseudogenes were mapped to
10q23.3, 17q25, and 19q13.2.

608064	TITLE *608064 KELCH-LIKE 5; KLHL5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Wang et al. (2001) cloned a full-length KLHL5 cDNA from a human fetal
brain cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a deduced 755-amino acid protein
that contains a BTB/POZ domain at the N terminus and 6 tandemly arranged
kelch repeats (kelch domain) at the C terminus. Both the BTB and kelch
domains are conserved in members of the kelch protein family. KLHL5
shares 43% sequence identity with the Drosophila Kelch protein, an
oligomeric ring canal actin organizer. It also shares significant
sequence identity with human KLHL2 (605774) and KLHL3 (605775). Northern
blot analysis revealed a single KLHL5 band with high expression in
ovary, adrenal gland, and thyroid, lower expression in prostate, testis,
spinal cord, lymph node, and trachea, and no expression in any other
tissue examined.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Wang et al. (2001) mapped the KLHL5 gene to
chromosome 4p15.1-p13.

611610	TITLE *611610 PHOSPHOGLUCOMUTASE 2-LIKE 1; PGM2L1
DESCRIPTION By database searching with the sequence of PGM2 (172000) as query,
Maliekal et al. (2007) identified PGM2L1. The deduced 622-amino acid
PGM2L1 protein has a molecular mass of 72 kD and shares 60% sequence
identity with the PGM2 protein. Sequence analysis suggested that PGM2L1
is a cytosolic protein. Quantitative RT-PCR of mouse tissues showed that
PGM2L1 was mainly expressed in brain where glucose-1,6-bisphosphate
synthase activity was previously shown to be particularly high. High
expression was also detected in testis, and intermediate expression was
found in thymus, spleen, lung, and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

In studies with PGM2 and PGM2L1 in E. coli, Maliekal et al. (2007) found
that PGM2 acted more than 10-fold better as a phosphopentomutase (both
on deoxyribose 1-phosphate and on ribose 1-phosphate) than as a
phosphoglucomutase, while PGM2L1 was about 5- to 20-fold better in
catalyzing the 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate-dependent synthesis of glucose
1,6-bisphosphate and other aldose-bisphosphates.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PGM2L1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP WI-15948). Scott (2007) mapped the gene to
11q13.4 based on an alignment of the PGM2L1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
AB019210) with the genomic sequence (build 36.2).

602859	TITLE *602859 PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS FACTOR 10; PEX10
;;PEROXIN 10
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Warren et al. (1998) identified the human ortholog of yeast PEX10.
Okumoto et al. (1998) isolated a human PEX10 cDNA by an expressed
sequence tag (EST) homology search of a human DNA database using yeast
Pex10 from Hansenula polymorpha, followed by screening of a human liver
cDNA library. This cDNA encodes a peroxisomal protein comprising 326
amino acids with 2 putative transmembrane segments and a C3HC4 zinc
finger RING motif. Both the N- and C-terminal regions of the PEX10
protein are exposed to the cytosol, as assessed by an expression study
of epitope-tagged PEX10 protein.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically
heterogeneous, lethal diseases that are characterized by neuronal,
hepatic, and renal abnormalities and severe mental retardation; in their
most severe form, death occurs within the first year of life. Cells from
all PBD patients exhibit decreased import of one or more classes of
peroxisome matrix proteins, a phenotype shared by yeast Pex mutants.
Warren et al. (1998) observed that Pex10 expression rescued peroxisomal
matrix-protein import in PBD patients' fibroblasts from complementation
group 7 (CG7). In addition, they detected mutations on both copies of
PEX10 in 2 unrelated CG7 patients. A Zellweger syndrome (PBD6A; 614870)
patient was homozygous for a donor splice site mutation (602859.0001). A
more mildly affected neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (PBD6B; 614871)
patient was a compound heterozygote for a missense mutation and a
nonsense mutation (602859.0002).

Okumoto et al. (1998) showed that PEX10 expression morphologically and
biochemically restored peroxisome biogenesis in fibroblasts from
Zellweger patients of the complementation group called B in Japan and 7
in the U.S. One patient was found to be homozygous for an inactivating
mutation, a 2-bp deletion immediately upstream of the RING motif, which
resulted in a frameshift, altering 65 amino acids from the normal. This
implied that the C-terminal part, including the RING finger, is required
for biologic function of the PEX10 protein. PEX10 cDNA derived from the
patient with the mutation was defective in peroxisome-restoring activity
when expressed in patient fibroblasts.

Warren et al. (2000) reported phenotype-genotype correlations in
patients with PEX10-deficient peroxisome biogenesis disorder. All 4
PEX10-deficient Zellweger syndrome patients were found to have nonsense,
frameshift, or splice site mutations that removed large portions of the
PEX10 coding region. In contrast, a more mildly affected PEX10-deficient
neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy patient expressed a PEX10 allele with a
missense mutation, H290Q (602859.0002), affecting the C-terminal
zinc-binding domain of the PEX10 product. These results supported the
hypothesis that severe loss-of-function mutations in PEX genes cause
more severe clinical phenotypes, whereas mildly affected PBD patients
have PEX gene mutations that retain residual function.

To quantitate the effects of PEX10 mutations, Warren et al. (2000) used
a functional complementation assay. They observed that nonsense and
frameshift mutations predicted to delete the C-terminal two-thirds
(R125X; 602859.0003) or one-third (704insA) of the protein displayed
nearly normal PEX10 activity. They also found that the unexpectedly high
PEX10 activity displayed by these cDNAs could be eliminated by removing
or mutating segments of the PEX10 cDNA downstream of the mutations.
Although these results demonstrated serious flaws in the PEX10
functional complementation assay, they suggested that the C-terminal
zinc-binding domain is critical for PEX10 function.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chen et al. (2010) reported that Drosophila pex mutants, including Pex2
(170993), Pex10, and Pex12 (601758), faithfully recapitulated several
key features of human PBD, including impaired peroxisomal protein
import, elevated very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) levels, and growth
retardation. Moreover, disruption of pex function resulted in
spermatogenesis defects, including spermatocyte cytokinesis failure in
Drosophila. Increased VLCFA levels enhanced these spermatogenesis
defects whereas reduced VLCFA levels alleviated them. Chen et al. (2010)
concluded that regulation of proper VLCFA levels by pex genes is crucial
for spermatogenesis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 6A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX10, IVS, G-A, +1

In a patient with Zellweger syndrome of complementation group 7 (PBD6A;
614870), Warren et al. (1998) found homozygosity for a splice donor-site
mutation in the PEX10 gene that resulted in exon skipping and loss of
407 bp from the PEX10 open reading frame. The change was a G-to-A
transition in the first position of the splice-donor site in an intron
that lies downstream from a 407-bp exon. This mutation corresponded to a
C-to-T transition at a CpG dinucleotide on the antisense strand. The
homozygous nature of this allele, which destroyed an SnaBI site, was
confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion of an amplified genomic DNA
fragment spanning the mutation. The PEX10-deficient cells of this
patient contained many peroxisomes and imported peroxisomal membrane
proteins but did not import peroxisomal matrix proteins, indicating that
the loss of PEX10 has its most pronounced effect on peroxisomal matrix
protein import.

.0002
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 6B
PEX10, HIS290GLN

In a mildly affected neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (see PBD6B, 614871)
patient, Warren et al. (1998) found compound heterozygosity for a
missense mutation in the PEX10 zinc-binding domain, his290 to gln, and
for a nonsense mutation, arg125 to stop (602859.0003). The 2 alleles
encoded partially functional PEX10 proteins.

.0004
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 6A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX10, 2-BP DEL, 814CT

In cells from a patient with Zellweger syndrome of complementation group
7 (PBD6A; 614870), Okumoto et al. (1998) found homozygosity for an
inactivating mutation, a 2-bp deletion at nucleotides 814 and 815 (CT).

The only diagnostic center for PBDs in Japan identified a total of 31
Japanese patients with PBD during the 20 years previous to the report of
Shimozawa et al. (2003). There were 27 patients with Zellweger syndrome,
including 2 sibs, 3 with neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD; see
601539), and 1 with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP; see
215100). No patient with infantile Refsum disease (IRD; see 601539) had
been detected. All 11 patients with Zellweger syndrome of
complementation group B had the same mutation, the homozygous 2-bp
deletion in PEX10: 814-815delCT. Analysis of single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) within PEX10 showed that the mutation probably
arose once on an ancestral chromosome in the Japanese population.

.0005
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 6A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX10, 1 BP-INS, 704A

In a patient with Zellweger syndrome (PBD6A; 614870), their patient
PBD117, Warren et al. (2000) found compound heterozygosity for an A
insertion following nucleotide 704 in exon 4 of the PEX10 cDNA and a
deletion/insertion/frameshift mutation (602859.0006) in exon 1 of the
genome DNA, resulting in loss of nucleotides 13 to 28 of the open
reading frame and replacement of these 16 basepairs by a 20-bp
insertion. The product of the second allele contained the first 4 amino
acids of PEX10 followed by an additional 46 residues and a termination
codon; there was no evidence of PEX10 mRNA expression from the second
allele.

614143	TITLE *614143 IGF-LIKE FAMILY RECEPTOR 1; IGFLR1
;;TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 149; TMEM149
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IGFLR1 is a receptor for IGFL1 (610544), which is upregulated in
psoriatic skin and in keratinocytes treated with TNF (191160) (Lobito et
al., 2011).

CLONING

By screening a human protein microarray with IGFL1, Lobito et al. (2011)
identified IGFLR1. The deduced 355-amino acid transmembrane protein has
an extracellular domain containing 12 conserved cysteines and a
conserved cytoplasmic region containing a putative death domain. IGFLR1
is conserved in mammals and fish. Sequence and structural analyses
indicated that IGFLR1 is a TNF receptor family member that is specific
for IGFL ligands. RT-PCR analysis of mouse tissues showed ubiquitous
expression of Igflr1, with highest expression in lymph node. RT-PCR of
sorted mouse splenocytes revealed highest expression of Igflr1 in T
cells. FACS analysis demonstrated surface expression of human IGFLR1 on
transfected cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By screening and reverse screening of a human protein microarray, Lobito
et al. (2011) confirmed that IGFLR1 interacted with IGFL1. IGFL3
(610546), though only 37% identical to IGFL1, also bound tightly to
IGFLR1. IGFL2 (610545) bound IGFLR1 more weakly, but IGFL4 (610547) did
not interact with IGFLR1.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the IGFLR1 gene to chromosome 19q13.12 based on an
alignment of the IGFLR1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC031329) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;SCOTIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zhang et al. (2000) cloned a cDNA encoding Scotin, which they called
HSPC217, from CD34 (142230)-positive hematopoietic stem/progenitor
cells. The deduced 170-amino acid protein contains an MYB (189990)
DNA-binding domain repeat signature. Microarray analysis of 5
hematopoietic cell lines detected low-level expression of Scotin in NB4
and Jurkat cells, but no expression was detected in HL60, K562, and U937
cells.

Bourdon et al. (2002) identified mouse Scotin by differential display of
spleen and thymus of normal and p53 (191170) null mice after gamma
irradiation of whole animals. The induced 1.85-kb transcript encodes a
deduced 235-amino acid protein. By searching an EST database using the
mouse sequence as probe, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Bourdon
et al. (2002) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding Scotin from a placenta
cDNA library. The deduced 240-amino acid human protein shares 70%
identity with mouse Scotin. Both the human and the mouse proteins
contain an N-terminal signal sequence, a central transmembrane domain
composed of 18 hydrophobic amino acids, and a proline/tyrosine domain,
and both show an apparent molecular mass of 25 kD by Western blot
analysis. Immunolocalization of exogenously expressed Scotin revealed
colocalization with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers. By mutation
analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the proline-rich domain
is required for ER localization.

GENE FUNCTION

Bourdon et al. (2002) noted that mouse thymus and spleen cells underwent
massive p53-dependent apoptosis following ultraviolet irradiation or
exposure to actinomycin D. They found that Scotin mRNA was induced
coincident with apoptosis and was expressed only in spleen and thymus of
irradiated wildtype mice and not in the spleen or thymus of irradiated
p53 null mice. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, they
confirmed direct binding between p53 and Scotin, and using a luciferase
reporter plasmid driven by the mouse Scotin promoter, they confirmed
dose-dependent p53 transactiviation. Furthermore, Bourdon et al. (2002)
showed that the apoptosis induced by the p53/Scotin pathway is caspase
dependent.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the
human Scotin gene contains 6 exons. They identified a p53-responsive
element of 9 decamers within the mouse Scotin promoter.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Zhang et al. (2000) mapped the human
Scotin gene to chromosome 3. By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et
al. (2002) mapped the Scotin gene to chromosome 3p21.3. They also
identified a Scotin pseudogene on chromosome Xq13.1-q13.3.

603083	TITLE *603083 HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEAR RIBOPROTEIN L; HNRNPL
;;HNRPL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complexes contain hnRNAs
and their associated proteins and are directly involved in mRNA
synthesis and maturation. hnRNP complexes contain more than 20 major
proteins, including the group A, B, and C core proteins and a more
heterogeneous population of larger polypeptides, such as HNRNPL
(Pinol-Roma et al., 1989).

CLONING

Pinol-Roma et al. (1989) noted that among the major polypeptides
associated with hnRNA in HeLa cells is a set of 2 distinct,
approximately 68-kD proteins, designated HNRPL and HNRPM (HNRPNM;
160994). By UV crosslinking proteins to RNA and by sedimentation
analysis before and after RNase digestion, Pinol-Roma et al. (1989)
demonstrated with a monoclonal antibody against HNRPL that HNRPL is
stably associated with hnRNP complexes. They also showed that HNRPL is
present in the nucleoplasm, in 1 to 3 unidentified discrete nonnucleolar
structures, and outside hnRNP complexes. The authors detected HNRPL in
various vertebrates and found that HNRPL is associated with most nascent
transcripts on the lampbrush chromosomes of the newt N. viridescens.
Pinol-Roma et al. (1989) screened a HeLa cell cDNA expression library
with serum containing antibodies against hnRNPs and isolated a cDNA
encoding HNRPL. Northern blot analysis detected an approximately 2.3-kb
HNRPL transcript in HeLa cells. The predicted 558-amino acid protein is
glycine- and proline-rich and has a calculated molecular weight of
60,187 Da. HNRPL contains 2 segments of approximately 80 amino acids
each that are weakly related to each other and to the ribonucleoprotein
consensus sequence-type RNA-binding domains of other hnRNP and snRNP
proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Translational repression of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1, or SLC2A1;
138140) in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; 137800) is mediated by a
specific RNA-binding protein that interacts with an AU-rich response
element in the 3-prime UTR of the GLUT1 transcript. Hamilton et al.
(1999) showed that HNRNPA2 (600124) and HNRNPL bound the 3-prime UTR of
GLUT1 mRNA. Induction of brain ischemia in rats or hypoglycemic stress
in 293 cells increased GLUT1 expression via mRNA stability. Polysomes
isolated from ischemic rat brains or hypoglycemic 293 cells showed loss
of HNRNPA2 and HNRNPL, suggesting that reduced levels of these
RNA-binding proteins results in GLUT1 mRNA stability.
Immunoprecipitation of polysomes from activated human T lymphocytes
suggested that HNRNPA2 and HNRNPL form a complex in vivo.

Ray et al. (2009) reported an RNA switch in the human VEGFA (192240)
mRNA 3-prime untranslated region (UTR) that integrates signals from
IFN-gamma (107570) and hypoxia to regulate VEGFA translation in myeloid
cells. Analogous to riboswitches, the VEGFA 3-prime UTR undergoes a
binary conformational change in response to environmental signals.
However, the VEGFA 3-prime UTR switch is metabolite-independent, and the
conformational change is dictated by mutually exclusive,
stimulus-dependent binding of proteins, namely, the IFN-gamma-activated
inhibitor of translation complex and HNRNPL. Ray et al. (2009)
speculated that the VEGFA switch represents the founding member of a
family of signal-mediated, protein-dependent RNA switches that evolved
to regulate gene expression in multicellular animals in which the
precise integration of disparate inputs may be more important than the
rapidity of response.

121013	TITLE *121013 GAP JUNCTION PROTEIN, ALPHA-5; GJA5
;;GAP JUNCTION PROTEIN, 40-KD;;
CONNEXIN 40; CX40
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Connexin proteins oligomerize to form intercellular channels, called gap
junctions, through which ions and small molecules move between adjacent
cells. See 121011 for a general discussion of the connexin gene family.

CLONING

Kanter et al. (1992) demonstrated that canine ventricular myocytes
express 3 distinct gap junction proteins, Cx40, Cx43 (GJA1; 121013), and
Cx45. Kanter et al. (1994) used PCR with primers based on rat and dog
Cx40 to clone human CX40. The CX40 gene encodes a predicted 358-amino
acid protein whose sequence is 82% identical to that of the rat and
mouse CX40 protein. Northern blot analysis showed that CX40 mRNA is
expressed as an approximately 3.3-kb transcript in ventricular
myocardium. In immunofluorescence studies, CX40 localized to
intercalated disc regions of the left ventricle, which join cardiac
myocytes and contain gap junctions.

Kaba et al. (2001) noted that cardiac myocytes are electrically coupled
via gap junctions. Immunohistochemical staining of embryonic mouse and
human fetal hearts localized CX40 at the superficial zones of trabeculae
in developing ventricles. As development progressed, CX40 became largely
confined to the conduction system.

By searching EST databases, Dupays et al. (2003) identified 2 CX40
splice variants that differed only in the 5-prime untranslated region.
RT-PCR detected expression of the transcript utilizing exon 1A in
endothelial cells, and the transcript utilizing exon 1B in normal
placental cytotrophoblasts and in malignant cytotrophoblastic cell
lines. Both transcripts were expressed in right atrial appendages and in
all heart regions investigated, with higher levels in atrium.
Transcripts including exon 1A predominated.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dupays et al. (2003) determined that the CX40 gene contains 3 exons,
which they designated 1A, 1B, and 2. Exons 1A and 1B are alternate
5-prime untranslated regions that appear to induce cell type-specific
expression, and exon 2 is the coding exon. The entire gene spans about
25 kb. The DNA sequence upstream of exon 1A contains 7 SP1
(189906)-binding sites and potential binding sites for transcription
factors that control vascular gene expression, such as ETS1 (164720) and
GATA (see 305371), but no TATA or CAAT box. The region upstream of exon
1B is preceded by 3 CAAT boxes, 2 SP1-binding sites, and multiple
binding sites for the basal transcription factors AP1 (see Jun, 165160)
and AP4 (600743). Kanter et al. (1994) had noted 1 coding exon and a
5-prime untranslated exon, corresponding to exon 1A, in the CX40 genomic
sequence.

Seul et al. (1997) characterized the structure of the mouse Cx40 gene.

MAPPING

Willecke et al. (1990) used a mouse cDNA probe in Southern analysis of
mouse-human somatic cell hybrids to map the human CX40 and CX37 (GJA4)
genes to 1pter-q12.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Gelb et al. (1997) mapped the
GJA5 gene to chromosome 1q21.1 in a region that shows homology of
synteny with mouse chromosome 3, where the mouse Gja5 gene maps.

GENE FUNCTION

The migration of lymphocytes from the circulation into tissues involves
a number of adhesion molecules and the expression of new molecules. Gap
junctions facilitate cell-to-cell adhesion and provide pathways for
direct intercellular communication. Oviedo-Orta et al. (2000) noted that
GJA1 is expressed in a number of lymphoid organs. By RT-PCR, Western
blot, and flow cytometric analyses, they showed that lymphocytes express
GJA1 and GJA5, but not GJB2 (121011), GJB1 (304040), GJA4 (121012), or
GJA7 (608655); GJA5 expression was restricted to tonsillar T and B
lymphocytes. Flow cytometric analysis showed that GJA1 and GJA5
expression increases after mitogenic stimulation. Extracellular connexin
mimetic peptide blocked dye transfer between lymphocyte subpopulations,
and gap junction inhibitors decreased the production of IgM in
cocultured T and B lymphocytes. The results identified gap junction
proteins as important cell surface components that modulate immune
responses.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Atrial Standstill

Groenewegen et al. (2003) reported a family in which 1 deceased and 3
living members had atrial standstill (108770). They identified a
mutation (D1275N; 600163.0034) in the SCN5A gene in all 3 affected
living members and in 5 unaffected members; the deceased member was an
obligate carrier. Several family members were found to have 2 closely
linked polymorphisms within regulatory regions of the GJA5 gene: a
-44G-A transition and a 71A-G transition. Only the 3 affected living
members coinherited the SCN5A mutation and the 2 rare GJA5
polymorphisms. Functional analysis demonstrated a 65% reduction in
promoter activity with the rare -44A/+71G GJA5 haplotype compared to the
more common -44G/+71A haplotype. Groenewegen et al. (2003) proposed that
atrial standstill in this family resulted from coinheritance of the
SCN5A mutation and the rare GJA5 polymorphisms.

- Familial Atrial Fibrillation 11

Gollob et al. (2006) presented evidence that tissue-specific mutations
in the GJA5 gene may predispose the atria to fibrillation. They
sequenced the GJA5 gene from genomic DNA isolated from resected cardiac
tissue and peripheral lymphocytes from 15 patients with idiopathic
atrial fibrillation (ATFB11; new). Four novel heterozygous missense
mutations (see, e.g., 121013.0001-121013.0002) were identified in 4 of
the 15 patients. In 3 patients, the mutations were found in cardiac
tissue specimens but not in lymphocytes, indicating a somatic source of
the genetic defects. In the fourth patient, the sequence variant was
detected in both cardiac tissue and lymphocytes, suggesting a germline
origin. Analysis of the expression of mutant proteins revealed impaired
intracellular transport or reduced intercellular electrical coupling.

Yang et al. (2010) performed direct sequencing of the coding region of
the GJA5 gene in 126 unrelated Chinese probands with familial atrial
fibrillation (AF) and identified a heterozygous nonsense mutation in 1
proband (121013.0003) that segregated with disease in the family.

Yang et al. (2010) analyzed the GJA5 gene in 218 unrelated Chinese
probands with AF and identified 3 heterozygous missense mutations in 3
probands (121013.0004-121013.0006, respectively). The mutations, which
all occurred at evolutionarily conserved residues, segregated with
disease in each family and were not found in 200 ethnically matched
controls.

Wirka et al. (2011) tested 8 SNPs within the CX40 region for association
with CX40 levels measured in atrial tissue from 61 individuals who had
undergone cardiac surgery, 85.2% of whom had a history of AF and 49.2%
of whom had AF at the time of surgery. The previously described CX40
promoter 'A' SNP dbSNP rs35594137 (-44G-A), which was in perfect linkage
disequilibrium with the SNP dbSNP rs1152588 (71A-G) in exon 1A, was not
associated with CX40 mRNA levels. However, a common SNP dbSNP rs10465885
located within the TATA box of an alternative CX40 promoter (promoter
'B') in exon 1B was strongly associated with CX40 mRNA expression (p
less than 0.0001) and displayed strong and consistent allelic expression
imbalance in human atrial tissue. A promoter-luciferase assay in culture
mouse cardiomyocytes demonstrated reduced activity of the promoter
containing the minor allele of this SNP (p less than 0.0001). Testing of
both dbSNP rs35594137 and dbSNP rs10465885 for association with
early-onset lone AF (onset at less than 60 years of age) in 384 cases
and 3,010 controls revealed that the promoter B SNP dbSNP rs10465885 was
associated with early-onset lone AF (odds ratio, 1.18; p = 0.046), and
metaanalysis of 2 additional early-onset lone AF case-control cohorts
confirmed the association (odds ratio, 1.16; p = 0.022) with dbSNP
rs10465885. The promoter A SNP dbSNP rs35594137, however, was not
associated with the lone AF phenotype in any of the cohorts studied or
in a combined analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gu et al. (2003) generated Cx40 +/- and -/- mice to study the role of
CX40 in cardiac morphogenesis. The overall incidence of cardiac
malformations was 18% in heterozygotes and 33% in homozygotes; the
malformations were more severe in homozygotes, and the incidence of
malformations was even higher (44%) in the offspring of -/- matings. The
most common malformations were of conotruncal origin, but endocardial
cushion defects and other malformations were also found. Gu et al.
(2003) concluded that CX40 is not essential for cardiogenesis, but its
absence or limited expression increases the probability of cardiac
malformations.

To study the role of gap junction communication in cardiac conduction,
Simon et al. (1998) generated Cx40 null mice. Using electrocardiographic
analysis, they showed that the null mice had cardiac conduction
abnormalities characteristic of first-degree atrioventricular block with
associated bundle branch block. Simon et al. (1998) concluded that gap
junctions are essential for the rapid conduction of impulses in the
His-Purkinje system.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 11
GJA5, ALA96SER

In both atrial tissue and lymphocytes from a 41-year-old male with
atrial fibrillation (ATFB11; 614049), Gollob et al. (2006) identified a
286G-T transversion in the GJA5 gene, predicted to cause an ala96-to-ser
(A96S) substitution. The variant was absent in the patient's 3 sibs and
wife but was present in his 2 sons, who had no history of atrial
fibrillation; however, on surface electrocardiography, the carrier sons
had an abnormally prolonged P-wave duration (more than 120 ms), a known
predictor of atrial fibrillation (Dilaveris et al., 1998). The variant
was also identified in lymphocyte DNA from a 48-year-old control subject
(population frequency, 0.6%). Gollob et al. (2006) noted that long-term
follow-up of asymptomatic persons carrying the ser96 allele was needed
to determine the clinical significance of the variant.

.0002
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, SOMATIC
GJA5, PRO88SER

In 2 unrelated subjects with atrial fibrillation (ATFB11; 614049),
Gollob et al. (2006) identified a 262C-T transition in the GJA5 gene,
predicted to cause a pro88-to-ser (P88S) substitution. The mutation was
detected in atrial tissue but not in lymphocytes, indicating a probable
somatic mutation. Gollob et al. (2006) noted that the pro88 residue,
located in the second transmembrane domain of connexin-40, is highly
conserved in mammalian and zebrafish connexins.

.0003
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 11
GJA5, GLN49TER

In 7 affected members of a Chinese family with paroxysmal or persistent
atrial fibrillation (ATFB11; 614049), Yang et al. (2010) identified
heterozygosity for a 145C-T transition in the GJA5 gene, resulting in a
gln49-to-ter (Q49X) substitution that was predicted to cause premature
termination and deletion of 3 transmembrane domains, 3 loop regions, and
the C terminus. The mutation was detected in 6 additional affected
family members, but was not found in 6 unaffected family members or in
200 ethnically matched controls.

.0004
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 11
GJA5, VAL85ILE

In affected members of a 3-generation Chinese family segregating
autosomal dominant atrial fibrillation (ATFB11; 614049), Yang et al.
(2010) identified heterozygosity for a 253G-A transition in the GJA5
gene, resulting in a val85-to-ile (V85I) substitution at a highly
conserved residue within the second transmembrane domain. The mutation
was not found in 4 unaffected relatives or in 200 ethnically matched
controls.

.0005
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 11
GJA5, LEU221ILE

In affected members of a 2-generation Chinese family segregating
autosomal dominant atrial fibrillation (ATFB11; 614049), Yang et al.
(2010) identified heterozygosity for a 661C-A transversion in the GJA5
gene, resulting in a leu221-to-ile (L221I) substitution at a highly
conserved residue within the fourth transmembrane domain. The mutation
was not found in 4 unaffected relatives or in 200 ethnically matched
controls.

.0006
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 11
GJA5, LEU229MET

In affected members of a 3-generation Chinese family segregating
autosomal dominant atrial fibrillation (ATFB11; 614049), Yang et al.
(2010) identified heterozygosity for a 685C-A transversion in the GJA5
gene, resulting in a leu229-to-met (L229M) substitution at a highly
conserved residue within the cytoplasmic region near the fourth
transmembrane domain. The mutation was not found in 4 unaffected
relatives or in 200 ethnically matched controls.

611412	TITLE *611412 N-ACETYLNEURAMINATE PYRUVATE LYASE; NPL
;;CHROMOSOME 1 OPEN READING FRAME 13; C1ORF13;;
DIHYDRODIPICOLINATE SYNTHASE;;
C112
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

N-acetylneuraminate pyruvate lyase (EC 4.1.3.3) controls the cellular
concentration of sialic acid by catalyzing the conversion of sialic acid
into acylmannosamines and pyruvate (Wu et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 1 associated with
hereditary prostate cancer (HPC1; 601518), followed by screening cDNA
libraries, Sood et al. (2001) cloned NPL, which they called C112. The
deduced protein contains 320 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
detected weak expression of a 5-kb transcript in all human tissues
examined.

By large-scale sequence analysis of clones obtained from a fetal brain
cDNA library, Wu et al. (2005) cloned a splice variant of NPL. The
deduced 301-amino acid splice variant, which they called NPLV2, contains
an N-terminal dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) domain and 5 putative
N-terminal phosphorylation sites. RT-PCR detected highest expression in
liver, kidney, and peripheral blood leukocytes, and lower expression in
placenta, pancreas, spleen, thymus, ovary, and small intestine. By
database analysis, Wu et al. (2005) identified 3 other NPL splice
variants.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wu et al. (2005) determined that the NPL gene contains 11 exons and
spans over 40 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sood et al. (2001) mapped the NPL gene to
chromosome 1q25.

;;STELLA, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF;;
PRIMORDIAL GERM CELL PROTEIN 7; PGC7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening for genes expressed in a sex-specific manner during early
embryonic gonadal development in the mouse, Bowles et al. (2003) cloned
Dppa3. The deduced protein contains 150 amino acids. Northern blot
analysis detected a 1.2-kb transcript expressed in male mouse gonads at
13.5 days postcoitum. In situ hybridization of whole mouse embryos
showed Dppa3 expressed initially in the gonads of both sexes, but
expression was downregulated in female gonads by at least 13.5 days
postcoitum. Embryonic mice deficient in germ cells did not express
Dppa3. Bowles et al. (2003) identified human DPPA3, which encodes a
160-amino acid protein. EST database searches revealed that human DPPA3
expression had been detected only in germ cell tumors, but not in normal
testis.

GENE FUNCTION

West et al. (2009) differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells carrying a
Stella transgenic reporter into putative primordial germ cells (PGCs) in
vitro. The Stella-positive cells possessed a transcriptional profile
similar to embryo-derived PGCs, and like their counterparts in vivo,
lost imprints in a time-dependent manner. Using inhibitory RNAs to
screen candidate genes for effects on the development of Stella-positive
cells in vitro, West et al. (2009) found that Lin28 (611043), a negative
regulator of let7 (605386) microRNA processing, is essential for proper
PGC development. Furthermore, Blimp1 (PRDM1; 603423), a let7 target and
a master regulator of PGC specification, rescued the effect of Lin28
deficiency during PGC development, thereby establishing a mechanism of
action for Lin28 during PGC specification. Overexpression of Lin28
promotes formation of Stella-positive cells in vitro and PGCs in
chimeric embryos, and is associated with human germ cell tumors.

Nakamura et al. (2012) showed that PGC7 protects 5-methylcytosine (5mC)
from Tet3 (613555)-mediated conversion to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)
by binding to maternal chromatin containing dimethylated histone H3
lysine-9 (H3K9me2) in mice. In addition, imprinted loci that are marked
with H3K9me2 in mature sperm are protected by PGC7 binding in early
embryogenesis. Nakamura et al. (2012) suggested that this type of
regulatory mechanism could be involved in DNA modifications in somatic
cells as well as in early embryos.

MAPPING

Bowles et al. (2003) identified the DPPA3 gene on chromosome 12p13.31.
They stated that the mouse Dppa3 gene maps to chromosome 6F2 in a region
that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 12p13.31.

611984	TITLE *611984 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S21; MRPS21
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPS21 is 1 of more
than 70 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes that are encoded
by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human MRPS21. The deduced 87-amino acid MRPS21 protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 10.7 kD. Koc et al. (2001) identified
MRPS21 orthologs in mouse, Drosophila, C. elegans, yeast, and E. coli.
Highest conservation is in the N-terminal and central regions of MRPS21
orthologs. Mouse and human MRPS21 share 90.8% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS map,
Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRPS21 gene to chromosome 1q21. Zhang
and Gerstein (2003) identified 9 MRPS21 pseudogenes scattered throughout
the genome.

615196	TITLE *615196 SHORT-CHAIN DEHYDROGENASE/REDUCTASE FAMILY, MEMBER 4-LIKE 2; DHRS4L2
;;DHRS4-LIKE 2;;
DHRS4P1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase enzymes, like DHRS4 (611596), are
NAD/NADP-dependent oxidoreductases that function in the breakdown of
steroids, retinoids, prostaglandins, and xenobiotics. DHRS4L2 arose by
duplication of the DHRS4 gene (summary by Gabrielli and Tofanelli,
2012).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of human neuroblastoma cell lines, Zhang et al. (2009) cloned
8 DHRS4L2 splice variants that originated from an alternative upstream
first exon. Database analysis revealed expression of DHRS4L2 from the
upstream exon in several normal human tissues, including brain,
placenta, and testis. RT-PCR confirmed abundant expression from the
upstream exon in testis, with much lower expression in other tissues
examined. RNA structural analysis of 2 of the variants suggested that
they are noncoding.

Gabrielli and Tofanelli (2012) reported that DHRS4L2, which they called
DHRS4P1, is transcribed, but that it contains a frameshift and stop
signal in exon 6 compared with DHRS4, which terminates in exon 8. The
deduced DHRS4L2 protein shares significant identity with the N-terminal
210 amino acids of DHRS4, but it lacks the C-terminal region of DHRS4.
Gabrielli and Tofanelli (2012) suggested that DHRS4L2 may be a
transcribed pseudogene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2009) determined that the DHRS4L2 gene contains 9 exons,
including 2 alternative first exons associated with alternative
promoters. The region upstream of exon 1 contains TATA and CCAAT boxes
and CpG islands.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang et al. (2009) mapped the DHRS4L2
gene near the DHRS4 gene on chromosome 14q11.2.

607081	TITLE *607081 TAP-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE; TAPBPL
;;TAP-BINDING PROTEIN-RELATED PROTEIN; TAPBPR;;
TAPBP-RELATED PROTEIN;;
TAPASIN-RELATED PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Tapasin, or TAPBP (601962), is a member of the variable-constant Ig
superfamily that links major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I
molecules to the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP;
see 170260) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The TAPBP gene is located
near the MHC complex on chromosome 6p21.3. TAPBPL is a member of the Ig
superfamily that is localized on chromosome 12p13.3, a region somewhat
paralogous to the MHC.

CLONING

By database searching with TAPBP as the probe, PAC clone analysis, and
5-prime RACE, Teng et al. (2002) identified a cDNA encoding TAPBPR. The
deduced 468-amino acid protein is 22% identical to TAPBP. It contains an
N-terminal signal sequence, a region weakly similar to an Ig-like or
fibronectin (FN1; 135600)-like domain, an IgV domain, an IgC1 domain, a
transmembrane region, and a 42-residue cytoplasmic tail with no ER
retention motif. Unlike TAPBP, TAPBPR does not have a conserved class I
molecule-binding region in its N terminus. RT-PCR analysis detected wide
expression in mouse tissues, with raised levels in kidney, adipose
tissue, salivary gland, placenta, ovary, and gut tissue. Fluorescence
microscopy demonstrated expression primarily in the ER, but also on the
cell surface. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis supported the
presence of a surface-expressed 52-kD protein, corresponding to the
predicted size. Teng et al. (2002) concluded that TAPBPR may be retained
in the ER by an unknown mechanism.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Teng et al. (2002) determined that the
TAPBPR gene contains 7 exons and spans 10 kb. Like TAPBP, TAPBPR lacks
TATA and CAATT boxes in the promoter region. In contrast to TAPBP,
TAPBPR also lacks gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) induction elements, a
finding supported by functional analysis.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Teng et al. (2002) localized the TAPBPL
gene to chromosome 12p13.3 between the CD27 (TNFRSF7; 186711) and VAMP1
(185880) genes.

601140	TITLE *601140 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1, REGULATORY SUBUNIT 14B; PPP1R14B
;;PHOSPHOLIPASE C, BETA-3, NEIGHBORING GENE OF; PLCB3N;;
PNG
DESCRIPTION Using a cosmid that contained the gene for phospholipase C-beta-3
(PLCB3; 600230), Lagercrantz et al. (1996) isolated and characterized a
gene that they called PLCB3-neighboring gene (PNG). PLCB3 is located on
11q13. PNG had no striking similarity to other known genes at the DNA
level, however, analysis of hybridization to a panel of somatic cell
hybrids indicated the existence of related sequences on chromosomes 2,
4, 7, and 22. PNG showed expression of a 1-kb message in multiple
tissues. The predicted protein is 119 amino acids long. The gene spans
approximately 2.5 kb and is divided into 4 exons and 3 introns. It is
located 4.4 kb upstream of PLCB3, with the 5-prime ends of each gene
facing each other. The intragenic region showed separate CpG islands at
each end separated by a stretch of 2 kb, characterized by periodic
alteration of the GC content. A 5-prime flanking region of PNG did not
contain TATA or CCAAT, suggesting to the authors a housekeeping promoter
structure.

Lagercrantz et al. (1996) described isolation and expression of the
murine homolog. The predicted murine protein contains 203 amino acids.

600264	TITLE *600264 ARGININE VASOPRESSIN RECEPTOR 1B; AVPR1B
;;ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE, RECEPTOR FOR, V1B;;
VASOPRESSIN V1B RECEPTOR;;
PITUITARY VASOPRESSIN RECEPTOR 3; AVPR3
DESCRIPTION The neurohypophyseal hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) induces diverse
actions, including stimulation of hepatic glycogenolysis, contraction of
vascular smooth muscle cells and mesangial cells, antidiuresis in the
kidney, and aggregation of platelets. These actions of AVP are mediated
through specific G protein-coupled receptors. AVP receptors are
classified into at least 3 subtypes: V1a, V1b, and V2. The V1a receptor
(600821) has been localized in the liver, vascular smooth muscle, brain,
mesangial cells, and platelets. The V2 receptor (300538) is exclusively
expressed in the kidney, and defects in this receptor result in
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Sugimoto et al. (1994) cloned the V1b
receptor from a cDNA library of human pituitary. (The gene is also
referred to as AVPR3.) AVP modulates the release of ACTH,
beta-endorphin, and prolactin from the anterior pituitary. Release is
mediated by the V1b receptor through the mobilization of intracellular
Ca(2+) by phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. The deduced 424-amino acid
sequence of the V1b receptor had highest overall homology with the V1a,
V2, and oxytocin receptors, with homologies of 45, 39, and 45%,
respectively. Expressed in COS-1 cells, V1b had a single binding site
for AVP. It bound various agonists and antagonists of vasopressin with
affinities distinct from those of V1a and V2 receptors but consistent
with those anticipated for the V1b receptor on the basis of
pharmacologic studies.

The AVPR1B gene was also cloned by de Keyzer et al. (1994), who referred
to it as AVPR3. Rousseau-Merck et al. (1995) mapped the gene to 1q32 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Birnbaumer (2000) noted that the biologic effects of AVP are mediated by
3 receptor subtypes: the V1A and V1B receptors that activate
phospholipases via Gq/11, and the V2 receptor that activates adenylyl
cyclase by interacting with GS. Isolation of the cDNAs encoding the V1A
and V1B receptor subtypes explained the tissue variability of V1
antagonist binding, whereas identification of the cDNA and gene encoding
the V2 receptor provided the information to identify the mutations
responsible for X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (304800).
Mutations that abrogate the production and/or release of AVP from the
pituitary have diabetes insipidus as their most dramatic manifestation,
indicating that the maintenance of water homeostasis is the most
important physiologic role of this neuropeptide.

The pituitary V3 vasopressin receptor was used by de Keyzer et al.
(1996) to analyze the corticotroph phenotype of secreting bronchial
carcinoids associated with the ectopic ACTH syndrome. Ectopic ACTH
secretion occurs in highly differentiated and rather indolent tumors
such as bronchial carcinoids or, in contrast, in various types of
aggressive and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. They found
that in 6 of 8 bronchial carcinoids responsible for the ectopic ACTH
syndrome, both proopiomelanocortin (176830) and the V3 receptor gene
were expressed at the same level as they are in ACTH-secreting pituitary
adenomas; in contrast, no POMC expression and only very faint V3
receptor expression were detected in 6 of 8 nonsecreting bronchial
carcinoids.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wersinger et al. (2002) found that mice with a targeted disruption of
the V1br gene, which is expressed in brain, exhibited marked reduction
in aggression and modest impairment in social recognition. The mice
performed normally in all other behaviors examined, including sexual
behavior, suggesting that reduced aggression and social memory are not
simply the results of a global deficit in sensorimotor function or
motivation. Wersinger et al. (2002) suggested that V1br antagonists may
be useful for the treatment of aggressive behaviors.

Tanoue et al. (2004) investigated the functional role of the V1b
receptor in vivo by using gene targeting to create a mouse model lacking
the V1br gene. Under resting conditions, circulating concentrations of
ACTH and corticosterone were lower in the null mice compared with
wildtype mice. The normal increase in circulating ACTH levels in
response to exogenous administration of AVP was impaired in the null
mice, whereas corticotropin-releasing hormone-stimulated ACTH release
was not impaired. The increase in ACTH after a forced swim stress was
significantly suppressed in the null mice. The results demonstrated that
the V1b receptor plays a crucial role in regulating
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. It does this by
maintaining ACTH and corticosterone levels, not only under stress but
also under basal conditions.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The MLL gene encodes a DNA-binding protein that methylates histone H3
(see 602810) lys4 (H3K4) and positively regulates expression of target
genes, including multiple HOX genes (see 142980). MLL is a frequent
target for recurrent translocations in acute leukemias that may be
characterized as acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 601626), acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or mixed lineage (biphenotypic) leukemia
(MLL). Leukemias with translocations involving MLL possess unique
clinical and biologic characteristics and are often associated with poor
prognosis. MLL rearrangements are found in more than 70% of infant
leukemias, whether the immunophenotype is more consistent with ALL or
AML6, but are less frequent in leukemias from older children. MLL
translocations are also found in approximately 10% of AMLs in adults, as
well as in therapy-related leukemias, most often characterized as AML,
that develop in patients previously treated with topoisomerase II
inhibitors for other malignancies. More than 50 different MLL fusion
partners have been identified. Leukemogenic MLL translocations encode
MLL fusion proteins that have lost H3K4 methyltransferase activity. A
key feature of MLL fusion proteins is their ability to efficiently
transform hematopoietic cells into leukemia stem cells (Krivtsov and
Armstrong, 2007).

CLONING

Recurring chromosomal translocations involving chromosome 11q23 have
been observed in both acute lymphoid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia
(AML; 601626), especially acute monoblastic leukemia (AML-M5) and acute
myelomonocytic leukemia (AMML-M4). Rowley et al. (1990) demonstrated
that the breakpoints in four 11q23 translocations associated with
leukemia were contained within a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clone
bearing the CD3D (186790) and CD3G (186740) genes. Within this YAC,
Ziemin-van der Poel et al. (1991) identified a transcription unit
spanning the breakpoint junctions of 3 of these translocations, 4;11,
9;11, and 11;19. They described 2 other related transcripts that were
upregulated in a translocation cell line. Ziemin-van der Poel et al.
(1991) named the gene MLL for myeloid/lymphoid, or mixed lineage,
leukemia. Cimino et al. (1991) identified the same gene and called it
ALL1.

Gu et al. (1992) determined that the ALL1 gene encodes a protein of more
than 3,910 amino acids containing 3 regions with homology to sequences
within the Drosophila 'trithorax' gene, including cysteine-rich regions
that can be folded into 6 zinc finger-like domains. Tkachuk et al.
(1992) showed that the ALL1 gene, which they referred to as HRX (for
'homolog of trithorax'), codes for a 431-kD protein. Djabali et al.
(1992) also cloned an 11.5-kb transcript spanning the 11q23
translocation breakpoint.

Parry et al. (1993) showed that the sequence of a partial TRX1 cDNA
contained an open reading frame encoding 1,012 amino acids with
extensive homology to the Drosophila trithorax protein, particularly in
the zinc finger-like domains. The TRX1 gene appears to be unique in the
human genome and has been conserved during evolution.

Butler et al. (1997) analyzed the distribution and localization of HRX
proteins in cell lines and human tissues, using both polyclonal and
monoclonal antibodies. Immunocytochemical analysis showed a punctate
distribution of wildtype and chimeric HRX proteins within cell nuclei,
suggesting that HRX localizes to nuclear structures in cells with and
without 11q23 translocations. Nuclear staining was found in the majority
of tissues studied, with the strongest reactivity in cerebral cortex,
kidney, thyroid, and lymphoid tissues. Thus, Butler et al. (1997)
concluded that HRX is widely expressed in most cell types, including
hematopoietic cells, a finding that precludes an immunocytochemical
approach for diagnosis of leukemias bearing 11q23 structural
abnormalities.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gu et al. (1992) determined that the MLL gene spans approximately 100 kb
and contains at least 21 exons.

MAPPING

The MLL gene maps to chromosome 11q23 (Ziemin-van der Poel et al., 1991;
Cimino et al., 1991).

GENE FUNCTION

Milne et al. (2002) showed that MLL regulates target HOX gene expression
through direct binding to promoter sequences. They determined that the
MLL SET domain is a histone H3 (see 601128) lys4 (K4)-specific
methyltransferase whose activity is stimulated with acetylated H3
peptides. This methylase activity was found to be associated with HOX
gene activation and H3 K4 methylation at cis regulatory sequences in
vivo. A leukemogenic MLL fusion protein that activates HOX expression
had no effect on histone methylation, suggesting a distinct mechanism
for gene regulation by MLL and MLL fusion proteins.

Nakamura et al. (2002) found that ALL1 is present within a stable
multiprotein supercomplex composed of at least 29 proteins. The majority
of the complex proteins are components of transcription complexes,
including TFIID (see 604912). Other components are involved in RNA
processing or histone methylation. The authors found that the complex
remodels, acetylates, deacetylates, and methylates nucleosomes and/or
free histones, and that the H3 K4 methylation activity of the complex is
conferred by the ALL1 SET domain. Chromatin immunoprecipitations showed
that ALL1 and other complex components examined were bound at the
promoter of an active ALL1-dependent HOXA9 gene (142956). In parallel,
H3 K4 was methylated, and histones H3 and H4 were acetylated at this
promoter.

The MLL gene encodes a large nuclear protein that is required for the
maintenance of HOX gene expression. MLL is cleaved at 2 conserved sites
to generate an N-terminal 320-kD fragment (N320) and a C-terminal 180-kD
fragment (C180), which heterodimerize to stabilize the complex and
confer its subnuclear destination. Hsieh et al. (2003) purified and
cloned the protease responsible for cleaving MLL, which they entitled
taspase-1 (608270). They determined that taspase-1 initiates a class of
endopeptidases that utilize an N-terminal threonine as the active-site
nucleophile to proteolyze polypeptide substrates following aspartate.
RNA interference-mediated knockdown of taspase-1 in HeLa cells resulted
in the appearance of unprocessed MLL and the loss of proper HOX gene
expression.

Lim et al. (2009) showed that Mll1 is required for neurogenesis in the
mouse postnatal brain. Mll1-deficient subventricular zone neural stem
cells survive, proliferate, and efficiently differentiate into glial
lineages; however, neuronal differentiation is severely impaired. In
Mll1-deficient cells, early proneural Mash1 (100790) and gliogenic Olig2
(606386) expression are preserved, but Dlx2 (126255), a key downstream
regulator of subventricular zone neurogenesis, is not expressed.
Overexpression of Dlx2 can rescue neurogenesis in Mll1-deficient cells.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrates that Dlx2 is a direct target
of MLL in subventricular zone cells. In differentiating wildtype
subventricular zone cells, Mash1, Olig2, and Dlx2 loci have high levels
of histone-3 trimethylated at lys4 (H3K4me3), consistent with their
transcription. In contrast, in Mll1-deficient subventricular zone cells,
chromatin at Dlx2 is bivalently marked by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, and
the Dlx2 gene fails to properly activate. Lim et al. (2009) concluded
that their data supported a model in which Mll1 is required to resolve
key silenced bivalent loci in postnatal neural precursors to the
actively transcribed state for the induction of neurogenesis, but not
for gliogenesis.

Liu et al. (2010) assigned MLL as a novel effector in the mammalian
S-phase checkpoint network and identified checkpoint dysfunction as an
underlying mechanism of MLL leukemias. MLL is phosphorylated at ser516
by ATR (601215) in response to genotoxic stress in the S phase, which
disrupts its interaction with, and hence its degradation by, the
SCF(Skp2) E3 ligase (see 601436), leading to its accumulation.
Stabilized MLL protein accumulates on chromatin, methylates histone H3
lysine-4 at late replication origins, and inhibits the loading of CDC45
(603465) to delay DNA replication. Cells deficient in MLL showed
radioresistant DNA synthesis and chromatid-type genomic abnormalities,
indicative of S-phase checkpoint dysfunction. Reconstitution of Mll-null
mouse embryonic fibroblasts with wildtype but not S516A or delta-SET
mutant MLL rescued the S-phase checkpoint defects. Moreover, murine
myeloid progenitor cells carrying an Mll-CBP (600140) knockin allele
that mimics human t(11;16) leukemia showed a severe radioresistant DNA
synthesis phenotype. Liu et al. (2010) demonstrated that MLL fusions
function as dominant-negative mutants that abrogate the ATR-mediated
phosphorylation/stabilization of wildtype MLL on damage to DNA, and thus
compromise the S-phase checkpoint. Together, Liu et al. (2010) concluded
that their results identified MLL as a key constituent of the mammalian
DNA damage response pathway and showed that deregulation of the S-phase
checkpoint incurred by MLL translocations probably contributes to the
pathogenesis of human MLL leukemias.

- MLL Fusion Proteins

Human ML-2 leukemia cells lack a normal MLL gene and exclusively express
an MLL/AF6 (MLLT4; 159559) fusion protein. Yokoyama et al. (2005) showed
that MLL/AF6 associated with menin (MEN1; 613733) in ML-2 cells.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed both proteins present on
upstream sites of the HOXA7 (142950), HOXA9 (142956), and HOXA10
(142957) promoters. Deletions and point mutations performed in the MLL
portion of the MLL/ENL (MLLT1; 159556) fusion protein revealed a high
affinity menin-binding motif (RXRFP) near the N terminus. Interaction
between oncogenic MLL and menin was required for initiation of
MLL-mediated leukemogenesis in mouse stem/progenitor cells, and menin
was essential to maintain MLL-associated myeloid transformation. Acute
genetic ablation of menin in mice reversed aberrant Hox gene expression
mediated by MLL-menin promoter-associated complexes and specifically
abrogated differentiation arrest and oncogenic properties of
MLL-transformed leukemic blasts.

By gel filtration, mass spectrometry, and Western blot analysis of human
cell lines, Nie et al. (2003) identified unique low-abundance SWI/SWF
complexes that contained ENL, several common SWI/SNF subunits, and
either BAF250A (ARID1A; 603024) or BAF250B (ARID1B; 614556). Western
blot analysis of HB(11;19) leukemia cells, which express the oncogenic
MLL/ENL fusion protein, revealed that MLL/ENL also interacted with the
BAF250B-containing complex. MLL/ENL-containing SWI/SNF complexes
coactivated the HOXA7 promoter in a reporter gene assay.

CYTOGENETICS

- MLL Breakpoint Cluster Region

The ALL1 gene is rearranged in acute leukemias with interstitial
deletions or reciprocal translocations between chromosome 11q23 and
chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 9, 10, or 19. Gu et al. (1992) cloned translocation
fragments from leukemic cells from t(4;11) and showed clustering of the
breakpoints in areas of 7 to 8 kb on both chromosome 4 and 11.
Sequencing indicated heptamer and nonamer-like sequences, associated
with rearrangements of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes, near
the breakpoints. This suggested a direct involvement of the VDJ
recombinase in the 11q23 translocations. Gu et al. (1992) determined
that the breakpoint cluster region within ALL1 spans 8 kb and
encompasses several small exons, most of which begin in the same phase
of the open reading frame.

McCabe et al. (1992) presented evidence that the breakpoints in all the
translocations involving 11q23 in leukemia cells, e.g., t(4;11) t(6;11),
t(9;11), and t(11;19), are clustered within a 9-kb BamHI genomic region
of the MLL gene. McCabe et al. (1992) detected rearrangements of DNA in
a fragment of the MLL gene by Southern blot hybridization. Djabali et
al. (1992) concluded that most of the breakpoints in infant leukemias
with t(4;11) and t(9;11) translocations lie within a 5-kb region.

Using a human TRX1 cDNA as a probe, Parry et al. (1993) demonstrated
that the gene is interrupted in both infant and adult acute myeloid
(AML) and lymphoid (ALL) leukemia patients with 11q23 translocations.
The structure of the TRX1 gene around the breakpoints show that this
part of the human gene is interrupted by 9 introns. As a result of the
rearrangement, zinc finger domains are translocated in both ALL and AML
patients.

Strout et al. (1998) analyzed the fusion sequences in genomic DNA from 9
patients with AML. Each had a partial tandem repeat spanning exons 2 to
6 of the ALL1 gene on 11q23. The breakpoint in intron 6 occurred in the
breakpoint cluster region and the other near the 3-prime end of intron
1. In 7 cases, a distinct point of fusion could not be identified;
instead, the sequence gradually diverged from an Alu element in intron 6
to an Alu element in intron 1 through heteroduplex fusion. The results
supported the hypothesis that a recombination event between homologous
Alu sequences is responsible for the partial tandem duplication of ALL1,
probably through an intrastrand slipped-mispairing mechanism, in the
majority of AML cases with this defect. This appeared to be the first
demonstration identifying Alu element-mediated recombination as a
consistent mechanism for gene rearrangement in somatic tissue.

- MLL/AF4 Fusion Gene

Gu et al. (1992) determined that the t(4;11) chromosome translocation in
leukemia results in 2 reciprocal fusion products coding for chimeric
proteins derived from ALL1 and from a gene on chromosome 4 that they
termed AF4 (MLLT2; 159557).

Translocations involving 11q23 in leukemia result in the translocation
of zinc finger domains with fusion to other genes on chromosome 4,
chromosome 9, or chromosome 19. The gene on chromosome 19 with which it
is fused is ENL (159556). Nakamura et al. (1993) showed that the genes
with which it is fused on chromosome 4 (AF4) and chromosome 9 (AF9;
159558) show high homology of sequence to ENL. The protein products of
the AF4, AF9, and ENL proteins contained nuclear targeting sequences as
well as serine-rich and proline-rich regions.

Independently, Domer et al. (1993) characterized the MLL/AF4 fusion
product generated by the t(4;11) translocation. The sequence of the
complete open reading frame for this fusion transcript revealed that the
MLL protein is homologous to DNA methyltransferase. In the fusion gene,
the 5-prime portion is derived from the MLL gene and the 3-prime portion
from the AF4 gene.

Gale et al. (1997) demonstrated that unique or clonotypic MLL-AF4
genomic fusion sequences were detectable in neonatal blood spots from
individuals who developed ALL at ages 5 months to 2 years, thus
providing unequivocal evidence for a prenatal initiation of acute
leukemia in young patients. They stated that common subtypes due to
other translocation fusion genes can be expected to have a similar
prenatal initiation.

In an infant diagnosed at the age of 3 weeks with ALL after presenting
with hepatosplenomegaly and marked leukocytosis, Raffini et al. (2002)
found a 3-way rearrangement of the MLL, AF4, and CDK6 (603368) genes. By
reverse-panhandle PCR, they identified a breakpoint junction of CDK6
from band 7q21-q22 and MLL intron 9. Thus, the patient had an in-frame
CDK6-MLL transcript along with an in-frame MLL-AF4 transcript.

Wang et al. (2010) studied leukemia stem cells in mouse models of acute
myelogenous leukemia induced by either coexpression of the Hoxa9
(142956) and Meis1a (601739) oncogenes or by the fusion oncoprotein
MLL-AF9. The authors showed that the Wnt (see 164820)/beta-catenin
(116806) signaling pathway is required for self-renewal of leukemia stem
cells that are derived from either hematopoietic stem cells or more
differentiated granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. Because the
Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is normally active in hematopoietic stem cells
but not in granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, Wang et al. (2010)
concluded that reactivation of beta-catenin signaling is required for
the transformation of progenitor cells by certain oncogenes.
Beta-catenin is not absolutely required for self-renewal of adult
hematopoietic stem cells; thus, targeting the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway
may represent a new therapeutic opportunity in acute myelogenous
leukemia.

- MLL/ENL Fusion Gene

In studies of a t(11;19)-carrying cell line, Tkachuk et al. (1992)
identified fusion transcripts expressed from both derivative
chromosomes. The more abundant derivative 11 transcript coded for a
chimeric protein containing the amino terminal 'AT-hook' motifs of the
HRX gene fused to the ENL gene (MLLT1; 159556) from chromosome 19. (ENL
was so named for '11-19 leukemia.') The HRX protein may have effects
mediated by DNA binding within the minor groove at AT-rich sites.
Tkachuk et al. (1992) referred to this type of leukemia as representing
the multilineage leukemias rather than mixed lineage leukemias. The cell
line carrying the t(11;19) was from a patient with T-cell precursor
acute lymphocytic leukemia (Smith et al., 1989).

Translocations involving 11q23 in leukemia result in the translocation
of zinc finger domains with fusion to other genes on chromosome 4,
chromosome 9, or chromosome 19. The gene on chromosome 19 with which it
is fused is ENL. Nakamura et al. (1993) showed that the genes with which
it is fused on chromosome 4 (AF4) and chromosome 9 (AF9; 159558) show
high homology of sequence to ENL. The protein products of the AF4, AF9,
and ENL proteins contained nuclear targeting sequences as well as
serine-rich and proline-rich regions.

- MLL/AF9 Fusion Gene

Translocations involving 11q23 in leukemia result in the translocation
of zinc finger domains with fusion to other genes on chromosome 4,
chromosome 9, or chromosome 19. The gene on chromosome 19 with which it
is fused is ENL. Nakamura et al. (1993) showed that the genes with which
it is fused on chromosome 4 (AF4) and chromosome 9 (AF9; 159558) show
high homology of sequence to ENL. The protein products of the AF4, AF9,
and ENL proteins contained nuclear targeting sequences as well as
serine-rich and proline-rich regions.

The human AF9 gene is one of the most common fusion partner genes with
MLL, resulting in the t(9;11)(p22;q23). Strissel et al. (2000)
identified several different structural elements in AF9, including a
colocalizing DNA topo II cleavage site and a DNase I hypersensitive
(DNase I HS) site. In addition, 2 scaffold-associated regions (SARs) are
located centromeric to the topo II and DNase I HS cleavage sites and
border breakpoint regions in 2 leukemic cell lines. The authors thus
demonstrated that the patient breakpoint regions of AF9 share the same
structural elements as the MLL BCR, and they proposed a DNA breakage and
repair model for nonhomologous recombination between MLL and its partner
genes, particularly AF9.

- MLL/AF6 Fusion Gene

Prasad et al. (1993) identified AF6 (MLLT4; 159559) as the fusion
partner of MLL in a common translocation, t(6;11)(q27;q23), associated
with leukemia. The t(6;11)(q27;q23) translocation results in a chimeric
MLL/AF6 protein with a calculated molecular mass of 325 kD. In the
chimeric protein, the N-terminal portion of MLL, including 3 AT hook
motifs, is fused to all of AF6 except the first 35 amino acids, leaving
the Ras-interacting domain and the DHR motif of AF6 intact. By Western
blot analysis of transfected COS cells and a human cell line with the
t(6;11)(q27;q23) translocation, Joh et al. (1997) found that the MLL/AF6
fusion protein had an apparent molecular mass of 360 kD.
Immunolocalization and cell fractionation followed by Western blot
analysis indicated that MLL/AF6 was targeted to the nucleus, whereas AF6
itself was cytoplasmic. Mutation analysis indicted that the region of
MLL containing AT hook motifs was responsible for the nuclear
localization of the chimeric protein.

- MLL/GPH Fusion Gene

Eguchi et al. (2001) found that the gephyrin gene (GPH; 603930) can
partner with MLL in leukemia associated with the translocation
t(11;14)(q23;q24). The child in whom this translocation was discovered
showed signs of acute undifferentiated leukemia 3 years after intensive
chemotherapy that included the topoisomerase II inhibitor VP16. The AT
hook motifs and a DNA methyltransferase homology domain of the MLL gene
were fused to the C-terminal half of GPH, including a presumed
tubulin-binding site and a domain homologous to the E. coli molybdenum
cofactor biosynthesis protein. Eguchi et al. (2001) suggested that
MLL-GPHN may have been generated by the chemotherapeutic agent, followed
by error-prone DNA repair via nonhomologous end-joining.

- MLL/GMPS Fusion Gene

In a patient with treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia and the
karyotype t(3;11)(q25;q23), Pegram et al. (2000) identified GMPS
(600358) to be the partner gene of MLL. The authors stated that GMPS was
the first partner gene of MLL to be identified on 3q and the first gene
of this type to be found in leukemia-associated translocations.

- MLL/FBP17 Fusion Gene

Fuchs et al. (2001) reported fusion of the gene encoding formin-binding
protein-17 (FBP17; 606191) to MLL in a child with acute myelogeneous
leukemia and a complex chromosome rearrangement,
ins(11;9)(q23;134)inv(11)(q13q23). The fused mRNA was represented by MLL
at the 5-prime end and FBP17 at the 3-prime end.

- MLL/LPP Fusion Gene

By FISH and Southern blot analyses, Daheron et al. (2001) identified a
rearrangement in the mixed lineage leukemia gene due to a novel
t(3;11)(q28;q23) translocation in a patient who developed acute myeloid
leukemia of the M5 type 3 years after treatment for a follicular
lymphoma. Through inverse PCR, they identified the LPP gene (600700) on
3q28 as the MLL fusion partner. The breakpoint occurred in intron 8 of
MLL and LPP. They found that the MLL/LPP and LPP/MLL predicted proteins
contain many of the features present in other MLL rearrangements.

- MLL/PNUTL1 Fusion Gene

Megonigal et al. (1998) examined the MLL genomic translocation
breakpoint in acute myeloid leukemia of infant twins. Southern blot
analysis showed 2 identical MLL gene rearrangements indicating
chromosomal translocation. The rearrangements were detected in the
second twin before signs of clinical disease and the intensity relative
to the normal fragment indicated that the translocation was not
constitutional. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with an MLL-specific
probe and karyotype analyses suggested that a t(11;22)(q23;q11.2)
disrupted MLL. Megonigal et al. (1998) used panhandle variant PCR to
clone the translocation breakpoint and identified a region of 22q11.2
involved in both leukemia and a constitutional disorder. By ligating a
single-stranded oligonucleotide that was homologous to known 5-prime MLL
genomic sequence to the 5-prime ends of BamHI-digested DNA through a
bridging oligonucleotide, they formed the stem-loop template for
panhandle variant PCR, which yielded products of 3.9 kb. The MLL genomic
breakpoint was in intron 7. The sequence of the partner DNA from 22q11.2
was identical to the human CDCrel (cell division cycle-related) gene
(PNUTL1; 602724) that maps to chromosome 22. Both MLL and PNUTL1
contained homologous CT, TTTGTG, and GAA sequences within a few
basepairs of their respective breakpoints, which may have been important
in uniting these 2 genes by translocation. RT-PCR amplified an in-frame
fusion of MLL exon 7 to PNUTL1 exon 3, indicating that a chimeric mRNA
had been transcribed.

- MLL/CDK6 Fusion Gene

In an infant diagnosed at the age of 3 weeks with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL; 613065) after presenting with hepatosplenomegaly and
marked leukocytosis, Raffini et al. (2002) found a 3-way rearrangement
of the MLL, AF4, and CDK6 (603368) genes. By reverse-panhandle PCR, they
identified a breakpoint junction of CDK6 from band 7q21-q22 and MLL
intron 9. Thus, the patient had an in-frame CDK6-MLL transcript along
with an in-frame MLL-AF4 transcript.

- MLL/LASP1 Fusion Gene

Strehl et al. (2003) identified a new MLL fusion partner on chromosome
17q in the case of an infant with AML-M4 and a t(11;17)(q23;q21)
translocation. FISH and RT-PCR analyses indicated a rearrangement of the
MLL gene, but no fusion with previously identified MLL fusion partners
at 17q, such as AF17 (600328) or MSF (604061). RACE revealed an in-frame
fusion of MLL to LASP1 (602920), a gene that is amplified and
overexpressed in breast cancer. The authors stated that retroviral
transduction of myeloid progenitors demonstrated that MLL/LASP1 was the
fourth known fusion of MLL with a cytoplasmic protein that has no in
vitro transformation capability, the others being GRAF (605370), ABI1
(603050), and FBP17.

- MLL/LAF4 Fusion Gene

Von Bergh et al. (2002) identified an MLL/LAF4 (601464) fusion gene in
an infant with ALL and a t(2;11)(p15;p14) translocation. Bruch et al.
(2003) also reported an infant with ALL and an MLL/LAF4 fusion caused by
an ins(11;2)(q23;q11.2q11.2) insertion.

- MLL/LARG Fusion Gene

In a patient with primary acute myeloid leukemia and a complex
karyotype, Kourlas et al. (2000) found that the 5-prime end of MLL at
exon 6 was fused in-frame with the 3-prime end of almost the entire open
reading frame of the LARG gene (604763), which lies on 11q23.
Transcriptional orientation of both genes at 11q23 was found to be from
centromere to telomere, consistent with other data that suggested that
the MLL/LARG fusion resulted from an interstitial deletion rather than a
balanced translocation.

- MLL/CBL Fusion Gene

Fu et al. (2003) found that the CBL gene (165360), which lies telomeric
to MLL on 11q23, was fused to MLL in an adult patient with de novo acute
myeloid leukemia (FAB M1). MLL exon 6 was fused in-frame with CBL exon
8. The genomic junction region involved the fusion of the 3-prime
portion of an Alu element in intron 6 of MLL with the 5-prime portion of
an Alu element in intron 7 of CBL. The absence of extensive sequence
similarity at both breakpoints of MLL and CBL indicated that the
recombination was not generated through homologous recombination. The
transcriptional orientation of both genes is from centromere to
telomere. The results of Southern blot analysis in conjunction with FISH
suggested that the MLL/CBL fusion was the result of an interstitial
deletion. CBL was the second MLL fusion partner identified on 11q23, the
first being the LARG gene. Fu et al. (2003) stated that at least 34
partner genes for MLL had been identified.

- MLL/AF10 Fusion Gene

Tanabe et al. (1996) identified an invins(10;11)(p12;q23q12) and other
complex chromosomal rearrangements in a 2-year old boy with acute
monoblastic leukemia (AML-M5). Cloning of the proximal 10p breakpoint
showed that the MLL gene at chromosome 11q23 was fused to the 3-prime
portion of AF10 (MLLT10; 602409) at chromosome 10p12. Cloning of the
telomeric 10p junction revealed that the 5-prime portion of AF10 was
fused with the HEAB gene (608757). The 5-prime AF10/HEAB fusion
transcript was out of frame, while the MLL/3-prime AF10 fusion was in
frame.

- MLL/AF15q14 Fusion Gene

Hayette et al. (2000) described a 48-year-old man with AML-M4 who was
cytogenetically characterized as 46,XY,-3,t(11;15)(q23;q1 4),+mar. The
bone marrow was hypercellular, with 80% blast cells. The patient was
treated by intensive chemotherapy and died 4 month after diagnosis. The
translocation resulted in a in-frame fusion between exon 8 of the MLL
gene and exon 10 of the AF15q14 gene (609173). The fusion transcript was
predicted to encode a 1,503-amino acid protein composed of 1,418
N-terminal amino acids of MLL and 85 C-terminal amino acids of AF15q14,
including the bipartite nuclear localization signal.

Kuefer et al. (2003) identified a similar t(11;15)(q23;q14) in a
3-year-old boy with de novo T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this
translocation, exon 9 of the MLL gene was fused in-frame to exon 12 of
the AF15q14 gene. The deduced 1,886-amino acid fusion protein, which
contains the N terminus of MLL up to lys1362 fused to the entire C
terminus of AF15q14 starting from residue ile1819, has a calculated
molecular mass of 208 kD. It differs from the fusion protein described
by Hayette et al. (2000) in that it has a coiled-coil domain but no
nuclear localization signal.

- MLL/CIP29 Fusion Gene

In an infant with AML-M4, Hashii et al. (2004) identified a
translocation, t(11;12)(q23;q13), in which the coding region of the
CIP29 gene (610049) was fused in-frame to exon 9 of the MLL gene. The
fusion protein had the N-terminal AT hooks and central DNA
methyltransferase homology region of MLL fused to nearly all of the
CIP29 protein, including the N-terminal SAP domain and 2 C-terminal
nuclear localization signals. RT-PCR confirmed expression of the fusion
transcript in patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

- MLL/SEPT6 Fusion Gene

Kadkol et al. (2006) described an infant with AML who had a
rearrangement between chromosomes 11q23 and Xq24. FISH analysis showed a
break in MLL, and RT-PCR analysis confirmed expression of an MLL/SEPT6
(300683) fusion transcript.

- MLL/MAML2 Fusion Gene

Nemoto et al. (2007) isolated MLL/MAML2 (607537) fusion transcripts from
secondary AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cells with
inv(11)(q21q23). RT-PCR revealed that exon 7 of MLL was fused to exon 2
of MAML2 in the AML and MDS cells. The inv(11)(q21q23) resulted in a
chimeric RNA encoding a putative fusion protein containing 1,408 amino
acids from the N-terminal part of MLL and 952 amino acids from the
C-terminal part of MAML2. The N-terminal part of MAML2, a basic domain
that includes a binding site for the NOTCH (see NOTCH1; 190198)
intracellular domain, was deleted in MLL/MAML2. The MLL/MAML2 fusion
protein in secondary AML and MDS and the MECT1/MAML2 fusion protein in
mucoepithelioid carcinoma, benign Warthin tumor, and clear cell
hidradenoma contained the same C-terminal part of MAML2. Reporter gene
assays revealed that MLL/MAML2 suppressed HES1 (139605) promoter
activation by the NOTCH1 intracellular domain.

- MLL/GRAF Fusion Gene

Borkhardt et al. (2000) found that the GRAF gene (605370) was fused with
MLL in a unique t(5;11)(q31;q23) that occurred in an infant with
juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.

- MLL/ABI1 Fusion Gene

Taki et al. (1998) analyzed a patient with AML and t(10;11)(p11.2;q23)
and identified, as a fusion partner with MLL, the gene ABI1 (603050) on
10p11.2. The ABI1 gene bore no homology with partner genes of MLL
previously described, but the ABI1 protein exhibited sequence similarity
to protein of homeotic genes, contained several polyproline stretches,
and included a Src homology-3 (SH3) domain at the C terminus. The
MLL-ABI1 fusion transcript in this patient was formed by an
alternatively spliced ABI1. In-frame MLL-ABI1 fusion transcripts
combined the MLL AT-hook motifs and DNA methyltransferase homology
region with the homeodomain homologous region, polyproline stretches,
and SH3 domain of the alternatively spliced transcript of ABI1.

- MLL/KIAA1524 Fusion Gene

Coenen et al. (2011) identified the karyotype 46,XX,t(3;11)(q12-13;q23)
in bone marrow of a 4-month-old Caucasian girl who presented with the M5
subtype of AML and central nervous system involvement. The patient died
9 weeks after diagnosis. The translocation resulted in fusion of intron
10 of the MLL gene on chromosome 11 to intron 16 of the KIAA1524 gene
(610643) on chromosome 3. The 2 genes are transcribed in opposite
orientations, suggesting that the translocation also required a
microinversion. RT-PCR analysis confirmed expression of the fusion
transcript, which was predicted to encode a 1,673-amino acid protein
containing the N-terminal AT-hook domain, subnuclear localization sites,
and methyltransferase domain of MLL fused to the C-terminal coiled-coil
domain of KIAA1524.

- MLL Duplication

In a study of patients with acute leukemia but no microscopically
visible change at 11q23, Schichman et al. (1994) found molecular
evidence of partial duplication of the ALL1 gene. The direct tandem
duplication involved a region spanning exons 2 to 6, and a partially
duplicated protein gene product was demonstrated. Thus, the ALL1 gene is
leukemogenic when it fuses with itself as well as when it fuses with one
of the genes on other chromosomes.

In addition to the translocations involving fusion of the ALL1 gene with
genes on other chromosomes producing acute lymphoblastic and myelogenous
leukemia, the ALL1 gene undergoes self-fusion in acute myeloid leukemias
with normal karyotype or trisomy 11. In addition, Baffa et al. (1995)
reported rearrangement of the ALL1 gene in a gastric carcinoma cell
line. A complex, 3-way translocation involving chromosomes 1 and 11 and
resulting in partial duplication of the ALL1 gene was found. Sequencing
of RT-PCR products and Northern blot analysis show that only the
partially duplicated ALL1 gene was transcribed, producing an mRNA with
exon 8 fused to exon 2. Thus, ALL1 gene rearrangement may play a role in
the pathogenesis of some solid malignancies. The absence of the normal
transcript in this cell line, in association with loss of heterozygosity
on 11q23 seen in solid tumors, suggests that ALL1 is involved in
tumorigenesis by a loss-of-function mechanism.

Approximately 90% of adult patients with de novo AML and trisomy 11
(+11) as a sole abnormality and 11% of adult patients with de novo AML
and normal cytogenetics carry a molecular rearrangement of the ALL1
gene. The rearranged ALL1 gene results from the direct tandem
duplication of a portion of ALL1 itself. Caligiuri et al. (1997) showed
that in cytogenetically normal cases of AML and cases with +11 as the
sole cytogenetic abnormality, only 1 chromosome contains the mutated
ALL1 allele. Thus, a single mutated ALL1 allele with the partial tandem
duplication is sufficient for ALL1-associated leukemogenesis,
irrespective of the number of normal genes present. The frequently
occurring specific association of +11 and ALL1 gene mutation in the
leukemic clone remained unexplained.

- Detection of MLL Rearrangements

Thirman et al. (1993) demonstrated that MLL gene rearrangements can be
detected with a single probe and a single restriction-enzyme digest. The
ability to detect an MLL gene rearrangement rapidly and reliably,
especially in patients with limited material for cytogenetic analysis,
should make it possible to identify patients who have a poor prognosis
and therefore require aggressive chemotherapy or marrow transplantation.

PHENOTYPE

The MLL gene spans the breakpoint in translocations involving 11q23,
which are responsible for approximately 70% of AML and ALL in infants
and are also observed in treatment-related leukemias, especially in
patients previously treated with drugs inhibiting topoisomerase II
(Gibbons et al., 1990; Thirman et al., 1993).

In 15 of 26 AML cases in infants, Sorensen et al. (1994) found
rearrangement of the MLL gene at the molecular level. These
rearrangements were clustered within an 11-kb region containing 9 exons
of the gene. In 14 of the 15 cases with rearrangements, the leukemia was
associated with myelomonocytic or monocytic phenotypes (M4 or M5 FAB
subtypes, respectively), both of which are associated with a poor
prognosis in childhood AML. In contrast, only 1 of 11 nonrearranged
cases had an M4 or M5 phenotype. Rearrangement also correlated
significantly with hyperleukocytosis, another clinical parameter
associated with poor outcome.

Kobayashi et al. (1993) described a case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
in a 44-year-old woman after adjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer;
they demonstrated rearrangement of the HRX gene.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemias carrying a chromosomal translocation
involving the MLL gene have a particularly poor prognosis. Armstrong et
al. (2002) showed that they have a characteristic, highly distinct gene
expression profile that is consistent with an early hematopoietic
progenitor expressing select multilineage markers and individual HOX
genes. Clustering algorithms showed that lymphoblastic leukemias with
MLL translocations can clearly be separated from conventional acute
lymphoblastic and acute myelogenous leukemias. Armstrong et al. (2002)
proposed that they constitute a distinct disease, denoted as MLL, and
showed that the differences in gene expression are robust enough to
classify leukemias correctly as MLL versus acute lymphoblastic leukemia
or acute myelogenous leukemia. Establishing that MLL is a unique entity
is critical, as it mandates the examination of selectively expressed
genes for urgently needed molecular targets.

PATHOGENESIS

Chromosomal translocations involving the MLL gene occur in about 80% of
infant leukemias. Epidemiologic studies have suggested that maternal
exposure to various substances such as pesticides, marijuana, or an
excess of flavonoids (naturally occurring inhibitors of topoisomerase
II) might be associated with acute leukemia in infants (Ross et al.,
1994). In search of possible agents inducing infant leukemia, Strick et
al. (2000) investigated bioflavonoids, natural substances in food as
well as in dietary supplements, that cause site-specific DNA cleavage in
the MLL breakpoint cluster region (BCR) in vivo. The MLL BCR DNA
cleavage was shown in primary progenitor hematopoietic cells from
healthy newborns and adults as well as in cell lines; it colocalized
with the MLL BCR cleavage site induced by chemotherapeutic agents, such
as etoposide (VP16) and doxorubicin (Dox). Both in vivo and additional
in vitro experiments demonstrated topoisomerase II (TOP2A; 126430) as
the target of bioflavonoids similar to the 2 chemotherapeutic agents.
Based on 20 bioflavonoids tested, Strick et al. (2000) identified a
common structure essential for topoisomerase II cleavage. The authors'
observations supported a 2-stage model of cellular processing of
topoisomerase II inhibitors: the first and reversible stage of this
cleavage resulted in DNA repair, but also rarely in chromosome
translocations; whereas the second, nonreversible stage led to cell
death because of an accumulation of DNA damage. These results suggested
that maternal ingestion of bioflavonoids may induce MLL breaks and
potentially translocations in utero leading to infant and early
childhood leukemia. Strick et al. (2000) concluded that although
bioflavonoids may be beneficial in certain circumstances, a potential
counterbalancing disadvantage is their possible role in causing
chromosome translocations leading to leukemia in all age groups,
analogous to the translocation forms of AML and ALL after cancer
chemotherapy. Ross (2000) commented on the observations of Strick et al.
(2000) in the context of clinical and epidemiologic findings on
childhood leukemia.

Wang et al. (2008) reported pharmacologic, physiologic, and genetic
studies that demonstrated an oncogenic requirement for glycogen synthase
kinase-3 (GSK3; see 606784) in the maintenance of a specific subtype of
poor prognosis human leukemia, genetically defined by mutations of the
MLL protooncogene. In contrast to its previously characterized roles in
suppression of neoplasia-associated signaling pathways, GSK3
paradoxically supports MLL leukemia cell proliferation and
transformation by a mechanism that ultimately involves destabilization
of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(KIP1) (600778). Inhibition
of GSK3 in a preclinical murine model of MLL leukemia provided promising
evidence of efficacy and earmarked GSK3 as a candidate cancer drug
target.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Huang et al. (2012) reported the crystal structures of human menin
(613733) in its free form and in complexes with MLL1 or with JUND
(165162), or with an MLL1-LEDGF (603620) heterodimer. These structures
showed that menin contains a deep pocket that binds short peptides of
MLL1 or JUND in the same manner, but that it can have opposite effects
on transcription. The menin-JUND interaction blocks JUN N-terminal
kinase-mediated JUND phosphorylation and suppresses JUND-induced
transcription. In contrast, menin promotes gene transcription by binding
the transcription activator MLL1 through the peptide pocket while still
interacting with the chromatin-anchoring protein LEDGF at a distinct
surface formed by both menin and MLL1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yu et al. (1995) reported that Mll deletion in mice was embryonic
lethal. Mll +/- mice had retarded growth, hemopoietic abnormalities, and
bidirectional homeotic transformation of the axial skeleton, as well as
sternal malformations.

Yamashita et al. (2006) examined the role of MLL in the immune system
using Mll +/- mice. Mll +/- Cd4-positive T cells differentiated normally
into antigen-specific effector Th1 and Th2 cells in vitro, but the
ability of memory Th2 cells to produce Th2 cytokines was dramatically
decreased. Histone methylation and acetylation at Th2 cytokine gene loci
was not maintained in Mll +/- memory Th2 cells. Levels of Gata3 (131320)
mRNA were normal in Mll +/- effector Th2 cells, but they were
substantially decreased in Mll +/- memory Th2 cells; mRNA levels of
other transcription factors were not affected in Mll +/- memory Th2
cells. Histone modifications of Gata3 were also aberrant in Th2 cell
lines in which Mll expression had been knocked down by small interfering
RNA. Ovalbumin-induced allergic eosinophilic inflammation was reduced in
Mll +/- Th2 cell-transferred mice. Yamashita et al. (2006) concluded
that MLL plays a crucial role in control of memory Th2 cell responses by
maintaining expression of GATA3 and production of Th2 cytokines.

Barabe et al. (2007) demonstrated that upon transplantation into
immunodeficient mice, primitive human hematopoietic cells expressing a
mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion gene generated myeloid or lymphoid
acute leukemias, with features that recapitulated human diseases.
Analysis of serially transplanted mice revealed that the disease is
sustained by leukemia-initiating cells that have evolved over time from
a primitive cell type with a germline immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH)
gene configuration to a cell type containing rearranged IgH genes. The
leukemia-initiating cells retained both myeloid and lymphoid lineage
potential and remained responsive to microenvironmental cues. Barabe et
al. (2007) concluded that the properties of these cells provide a
biologic basis for several clinical hallmarks of MLL leukemias.

McMahon et al. (2007) found that fetal liver from Mll-knockout mouse
embryos showed defects in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor pool,
including reductions in long-term and short-term hematopoietic stem cell
numbers and a decrease in the quiescent hematopoietic stem cell
fraction. Adult mice with conditional Mll knockout had no apparent
abnormalities in mature hematopoietic cells in bone marrow, spleen, and
thymus. However, conditional Mll-knockout bone marrow cells produced
reduced numbers of colony-forming units and showed reduced ability to
compete in hematopoietic reconstitution assays. McMahon et al. (2007)
concluded that MLL has a critical role in regulating stem cell
self-renewal.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Jones et al. (2012) performed whole-exome sequencing in 4 patients with
hypertrichosis cubiti, short stature, a distinctive facial appearance,
and intellectual disability (Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome; 605130), and
identified 3 different heterozygous de novo truncating mutations, all
within exon 27 of the MLL gene (159555.0001-159555.0003) in 3 of the 4
patients. Analysis of MLL in 2 additional patients with a similar
phenotype revealed heterozygosity for 2 more de novo truncating
mutations (159555.0004 and 159555.0005). The variants were confirmed by
Sanger sequencing, and none were found in dbSNP, the 1000 Genomes
Project, 600 unrelated control exome profiles, or DNA from the
unaffected parents.

611667	TITLE *611667 SPERMATOGENESIS-ASSOCIATED SERINE-RICH PROTEIN 2; SPATS2
;;SPATA10;;
SERINE-RICH SPERMATOCYTES AND ROUND SPERMATID PROTEIN, 59-KD; P59SCR;;
SCR59
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By immunoscreening of a mouse testis cDNA library using polyclonal
antibody against Tp73l (TP63; 603273), followed by database analysis,
Senoo et al. (2002) isolated Spats2, which they called p59Scr. The
545-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 59 kD. Spats2
has a basic amino acid-rich region, is rich in serine residues, and
contains 4 predicted N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected strong expression in adult testis, moderate
expression in brain and thymus, and weak expression in ovary, kidney,
lung, heart, stomach, skeletal muscle. In situ hybridization of adult
mouse testis tissue demonstrated Spats2 expression that varied with the
seminiferous cycle during spermatogenesis, with cytoplasmic expression
in spermatocytes, round spermatids, and elongated spermatids. No
expression was detected in spermatogonia. In developing mouse testis,
Spats2 was detected at 1 week, increased rapidly to reach a maximum
level at 6 weeks, which coincides with testicular maturation, and
remained constant at a high level throughout adulthood.

GENE FUNCTION

Senoo et al. (2002) showed that mouse Spats2 mRNA levels in surgically
removed mouse testis decreased to 60% of the levels in scrotal testis at
8 days after surgery. Spats2 mRNA levels in surgically removed testis
subjected to high temperature stress decreased more than compared to
testis-specific kinase (MAK; 154235) and beta-actin (ACTB; 102630)
levels. Senoo et al. (2002) suggested that SPATS2 may play a role in
testicular germ cell development.

186852	TITLE *186852 PROTEASOME 26S SUBUNIT, ATPase, 3; PSMC3
;;TAT-BINDING PROTEIN 1; TBP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) protein Tat is a potent
activator of virus gene expression and replication. Nelbock et al.
(1990) used biotinylated Tat as a probe to screen a lambda-gt11 fusion
protein library, thereby cloning a cDNA encoding a protein that
interacts with Tat. Expression of this protein, designated Tat-binding
protein-1, was observed in a variety of cell lines, with expression
being highest in human cells. TBP1 was localized predominantly in the
nucleus, which is consistent with the nuclear localization of Tat. In
cotransfection experiments, expression of TBP1 was able to suppress
Tat-mediated transactivation specifically. Nelbock et al. (1990)
recommended their strategy for direct identification and cloning of
genes encoding proteins that associate with other proteins to modulate
their activity in a positive or negative fashion. Ohana et al. (1993)
suggested that TBP1 is involved in Tat-mediated transcriptional
activation.

GENE FUNCTION

Ubiquitinated proteins are degraded by a 26S ATP-dependent protease. The
protease is composed of a 20S catalytic proteasome and 2 PA700
regulatory modules (see PSMC1; 602706). DeMartino et al. (1996)
identified a protein complex that enhances PA700 activation of the
proteasome. They found that 2 proteins, p42 (PSMC6; 602708) and p50
(PSMC3), are components of both this complex and PA700. By protein
sequence analysis, DeMartino et al. (1996) determined that p50 and TBP1
are identical.

Hoyle et al. (1997) stated that the PSMC3 gene encodes a protein with 1
AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) domain (see
PSMC5; 601681) toward the C terminus.

Corn et al. (2003) established that pVHL (608537), the protein that is
mutant in von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (193300), binds to TBP1. TBP1
associates with the beta-domain of pVHL and complexes with pVHL and
hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF1A (603348) in vivo.
Overexpression of TBP1 promotes degradation of HIF1A in a pVHL-dependent
manner that requires the ATPase domain of TBP1. Several distinct
mutations in exon 2 of the VHL gene disrupt binding of pVHL to TBP1. A
pVHL mutant containing an exon 2 missense substitution
coimmunoprecipitated with HIF1A, but not TBP1, and did not promote
degradation of HIF1A. Thus, the ability of pVHL to degrade HIF1A depends
in part on its interaction with TBP1 and suggests a new mechanism for
HIF1A stabilization in some pVHL-deficient tumors.

MAPPING

By PCR amplification of a partial PSMC3 sequence, Hoyle et al. (1997)
demonstrated that the PSMC3 gene is located on chromosome 11. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the assignment was
regionalized to 11p13-p12. Tanahashi et al. (1998) mapped the PSMC3 gene
to 11p11.2 by FISH. By interspecific backcross analysis, Sakao et al.
(2000) mapped the mouse Psmc3 gene to chromosome 2.

By screening a testis library with a partial ADAM20 (603712) cDNA, Hooft
van Huijsduijnen (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding ADAM21. Northern blot
analysis detected ADAM20 and ADAM21 expression as approximately 2.8-kb
mRNAS, with ADAM21 being slightly shorter, only in testis. Like ADAM20,
the predicted 542-amino acid ADAM21 protein contains putative
cell-fusion peptides required for sperm-egg fusion. Overall, the 2
proteins are 50% identical and share sequence similarity with ADAM9
(602713) and the fertilins. In mammals, ADAM1 and ADAM2 (601533), also
known as fertilin-alpha and -beta, respectively, are expressed as
heterodimers on the posterior head of spermatocytes and play a role in
oocyte adhesion and fusion. The human ADAM1 homolog, however, is
nonfunctional.

GENE FUNCTION

Hooft van Huijsduijnen (1998) noted that the exclusive expression of
ADAM20 and ADAM21 in human testis and their sequence similarity with the
fertilins suggest that they too are expressed on sperm cells and are
involved in sperm maturation and/or fertilization. The authors proposed
that ADAM20 and/or ADAM21 is the functional equivalent of sperm
fertilin-alpha (ADAM1), since that gene is nonfunctional in human.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid panel, Hooft van Huijsduijnen (1998)
mapped both the ADAM20 and the ADAM21 genes to 14q24.1, suggesting that
they arose by gene duplication.

602344	TITLE *602344 PLATELET-ACTIVATING FACTOR ACETYLHYDROLASE 2; PAFAH2
DESCRIPTION Hattori et al. (1996) reported the cloning of a novel isoform of
platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase (AH), termed PAFAH2 by
the authors, from human tissue. PAFAH2 encodes a 392-amino acid
polypeptide with a predicted mass of approximately 43 kD. Other PAF
acetylhydrolases include the isoform found in plasma (PAFAH; 601690) and
isoform Ib (PAFAH1B1; 601545), which is found in brain and is associated
with lissencephaly (607432). Hattori et al. (1996) found that PAFAH2
shares approximately 43% identity with plasma PAFAH, but has virtually
no similarity to brain PAFAH1B1. Unlike PAFAH, PAFAH2 contains no
secretory signal sequence, confirming its intracellular localization.
Northern blotting of bovine tissue revealed that PAFAH2 is expressed at
highest level in liver and at lower levels in a variety of other
tissues.

602074	TITLE *602074 DEATH-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 3; DAP3
;;MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S29; MRPS29
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kissil et al. (1995) cloned DAP3. DAP3 is transcribed into a 1.7-kb mRNA
and encodes a 46-kD protein carrying a potential nucleotide-binding
motif.

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human DAP3, which they called MRPS29. The deduced 397-amino
acid MRPS29 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 45.6 kD. Removal
of a predicted 16-amino acid N-terminal mitochondrial localization
signal results in a mature 43.6-kD protein. Koc et al. (2001) identified
MRPS29 orthologs in mouse, Drosophila, C. elegans, and yeast, but not in
E. coli. Mouse and human MRPS29 share 81.8% amino acid identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Kissil et al. (1995) found that DAP3 was involved in mediating
interferon-gamma (147570)-induced cell death. Several lines of evidence
suggested that suppression of cell death is a critical step in the
multistage process of tumorigenesis. Kissil et al. (1995) concluded that
DAP3, being a positive mediator of cell death, may be a tumor suppressor
gene subject to loss or inactivation in tumors.

MAPPING

Kissil and Kimchi (1997) mapped the DAP3 gene to chromosome 1q21 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Verification of the assignment was
achieved by identifying the gene in a YAC contig encompassing chromosome
1q21.1-q21.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hirota et al. (2004) found a strong association between bronchial asthma
(600807) in adults and SNPs in the DAP3 gene (p = 0.0051; OR = 1.87; 95%
CI = 1.20-2.92), but no association with childhood asthma. The tendency
was more prominent in patients with high serum total immunoglobulin E
(IgE; 147180). DAP3 was found to be expressed in normal bronchial
epithelial cells, and that expression was induced by IFNG.

611348	TITLE *611348 INTEGRATOR COMPLEX SUBUNIT 4; INTS4
;;INT4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

INTS4 is a subunit of the Integrator complex, which associates with the
C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II large subunit (POLR2A; 180660)
and mediates 3-prime end processing of small nuclear RNAs U1 (RNU1;
180680) and U2 (RNU2; 180690) (Baillat et al., 2005).

GENE FUNCTION

By SDS-PAGE of proteins that copurified with INTS11 (CPSF3L; 611354) in
HEK293 cells, Baillat et al. (2005) identified INTS4 as a subunit of the
Integrator complex.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the INTS4
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP RH12075).

609004	TITLE *609004 B-CELL CLL/LYMPHOMA 9-LIKE; BCL9L
;;BCL9-2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to BCL9 (602597), Katoh and
Katoh (2003) identified BCL9L. The deduced 1,499-amino acid protein
contains 6 regions of homology with other BCL proteins. It has a nuclear
localization signal, but no signal peptide or transmembrane domain.
Katoh and Katoh (2003) also identified the mouse Bcl9l gene. The deduced
mouse protein shares 94% identity with human BCL9L. In silico analysis
of human mRNAs indicated that BCL9L is expressed in fetal brain, adult
lung, amygdala, eye, and prostate, as well as in several types of
tumors.

GENE FUNCTION

Brembeck et al. (2004) found that BCL9-2 induced epithelial mesenchymal
transitions in a nontransformed canine kidney cell line and increased
beta-catenin (116806)-dependent transcription. RNA interference of
BCL9-2 in carcinoma cells induced an epithelial phenotype and
translocated beta-catenin from the nucleus to the cell membrane. The
switch between the adhesive and transcriptional functions of
beta-catenin was modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin,
which favored BCL9-2 binding and precluded interaction with
alpha-catenin (see 116805). During zebrafish embryogenesis, Bcl9-2 acted
in the Wnt8 (see 606360) signaling pathway and regulated mesoderm
patterning.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2003) determined that the BCL9L gene contains 8 exons
and spans 15 kb. The mouse Bcl9l gene contains 8 exons and has the same
exon-intron structure.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2003) mapped the BCL9L
gene to chromosome 11q23.3.

;;LOSS OF HETEROZYGOSITY, CHROMOSOME 11, REGION 2, GENE A; LOH11CR2A;;
BREAST CANCER SUPPRESSOR CANDIDATE 1; BCSC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chromosomal deletions in chromosomal segment 11q23 are associated with
various human tumors. In lung and breast carcinomas, 2 common regions of
loss of heterozygosity have been identified at 11q23, suggesting that
the same tumor susceptibility genes are altered in these malignancies.
Monaco et al. (1997) stated that the more distal of these 2 regions,
region 2, spans less than 1.7 Mb. They identified a cDNA from region 2
and designated it LOH11CR2A. The cDNA encodes a predicted 438-amino acid
protein. Northern blot analysis revealed that LOH11CR2A is expressed
ubiquitously as a 3.3-kb mRNA.

Martin et al. (2003) found that, unlike the human BCSC1 gene, mouse
Bcsc1 is expressed as a single mRNA transcript of approximately 4 kb and
encodes a 793-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 87
kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Monaco et al. (1997) reported that the LOH11CR2A coding region is
composed of 10 exons and spans 30 to 40 kb. There are at least 2
additional exons encoding the 5-prime untranslated region.

Contrary to the original characterization of the LOH11CR2A gene (Monaco
et al., 1997), Martin et al. (2003) found that the gene, which they
called BCSC1, contains 20 exons instead of 10 and possesses a larger
open reading frame. The mouse gene was found to span a genomic region of
25 kb and to comprise 20 exons also.

MAPPING

Monaco et al. (1997) identified the LOH11CR2A gene within a region of
chromosome 11q23 associated with various human tumors.

GENE FUNCTION

Based on a mutation analysis of multiple human carcinomas and tumors,
Monaco et al. (1997) concluded that LOH11CR2A is unlikely to be involved
in the tumorigenic process.

By constructing a physical map of the LOH11CR2 minimal region of loss on
11q23-q24 associated with lung and breast carcinomas, Martin et al.
(2003) were able to clone a hereditary translocation, t(11;12)(q23;q24),
from a patient with early-onset breast cancer and family history of
cancer. The breakpoint was found within 6 kb of the BCSC1 candidate
tumor suppressor gene located in the LOH11CR2 region, whereas additional
LOH analysis in breast and ovarian tumors, including that of the patient
with the t(11;12)(q23;q24) translocation, implicated the BCSC1 locus as
the primary target of deletion. Northern analysis of the BCSC1 mRNA
revealed a lack of expression in 33 of 41 (80%) tumor cell lines, and
its ectopic expression led to the suppression of colony formation in
vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. These data suggested that BCSC1 may
exert a tumor suppressor activity and is a likely target of the LOH
observed on 11q23-q24 in cancer. Martin et al. (2003) used tumor
biopsies available from breast and ovarian cancer patients used in the
LOH analysis to screen for mutations in the BCSC1 coding region by PCR
and direct sequencing. Several previously reported polymorphisms were
found, although no tumor-specific, somatic mutations were observed.
Other results indicated that the mechanism for BCSC1 gene inactivation
in tumor cells is the loss of gene expression of one allele and deletion
of the other.

TET ONCOGENE 1;;
CXXC FINGER PROTEIN 6; CXXC6;;
LEUKEMIA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN WITH A CXXC DOMAIN; LCX;;
KIAA1676
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Methylation of DNA on cytosines is an important mechanism for silencing
gene expression, and cytosine demethylation is required for gene
activation. TET1 is the founding member of a family of methylcytosine
dioxygenases that perform several steps required for cytosine
demethylation and gene activation (Ito et al., 2011; He et al., 2011).

CLONING

To identify the fusion partner of MLL in the translocation
t(10;11)(q22;q23), Ono et al. (2002) analyzed leukemic cells from an
individual with AML-M2 associated with t(10;11)(q22;q23), and identified
TET1, which they called LCX (leukemia-associated protein with a CXXC
domain) as a novel fusion partner of the MLL gene. Ono et al. (2002)
found that the LCX gene encodes a 2,136-amino acid protein with a
zinc-binding CXXC domain (which MLL also contains) within a
methyltransferase domain, 3 nuclear localizations signals, and an
alpha-helical coiled-coil region. Ono et al. (2002) found 3 RNA
transcripts of LCX, each with a distinctive pattern of tissue
expression. LCX was expressed in 8 of 22 leukemic cell lines, but not in
EBV-induced normal B-cell lines. The MLL-LCX fusion protein lacked a
CXXC domain of LCX, but retained an alpha-helical coiled-coil region at
the C terminus, similar to MLL-AF6 (see 159559), MLL-AF1P (see 600051),
and other fusion proteins involved in the pathogenesis of
11q23-associated leukemia.

GENE FUNCTION

In a computational search for enzymes that could modify 5-methylcytosine
(5mC), Tahiliani et al. (2009) identified TET proteins as mammalian
homologs of the trypanosome proteins JBP1 and JBP2, which have been
proposed to oxidize the 5-methyl group of thymine. They showed that
TET1, a fusion partner of the MLL gene in acute myeloid leukemia, is a
2-oxoglutarate (2OG)- and Fe(II)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes
conversion of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) in cultured cells and
in vitro. hmC is present in the genome of mouse embryonic stem cells,
and hmC levels decrease upon RNA interference-mediated depletion of
TET1. Thus, Tahiliani et al. (2009) concluded that TET proteins have
potential roles in epigenetic regulation through modification of 5mC to
hmC.

Ito et al. (2010) extended the study of Tahiliani et al. (2009) by
demonstrating that all 3 mouse TET proteins, Tet1, Tet2 (612839), and
Tet3 (613555), can catalyze the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC. Tet1 has an
important role in mouse embryonic stem cell maintenance through
maintaining the expression of Nanog (607937) in embryonic stem cells.
Downregulation of Nanog via Tet1 knockdown correlated with methylation
of the Nanog promoter, supporting a role for Tet1 in regulating DNA
methylation status. Furthermore, knockdown of Tet1 in preimplantation
embryos resulted in a bias towards trophectoderm differentiation. Thus,
Ito et al. (2010) concluded that their studies not only uncovered the
enzymatic activity of the Tet proteins, but also demonstrated a role for
Tet1 in embryonic stem cell maintenance and inner cell mass cell
specification.

Williams et al. (2011) showed that TET1 binds throughout the genome of
embryonic stem cells, with the majority of binding sites located at
transcription start sites of CpG-rich promoters and within genes. The
hmC modification is found in gene bodies and in contrast to mC is also
enriched at CpG-rich transcription start sites. Williams et al. (2011)
provided further evidence that TET1 has a role in transcriptional
repression. TET1 binds a significant proportion of Polycomb group target
genes. Furthermore, TET1 associates and colocalizes with the SIN3A
(607776) corepressor complex. Williams et al. (2011) proposed that TET1
fine tunes transcription, opposes aberrant DNA methylation at CpG-rich
sequences, and thereby contributes to the regulation of DNA methylation
fidelity.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput DNA
sequencing, Wu et al. (2011) demonstrated in mouse embryonic stem (ES)
cells that Tet1 is preferentially bound to CpG-rich sequences at
promoters of both transcriptionally active and Polycomb-repressed genes.
Despite an increase in levels of DNA methylation at many Tet1-binding
sites, Tet1 depletion does not lead to downregulation of all the Tet1
targets. Interestingly, although Tet1-mediated promoter hypomethylation
is required for maintaining the expression of a group of
transcriptionally active genes, it is also involved in repression of
Polycomb-targeted developmental regulators. Tet1 contributes to
silencing of this group of genes by facilitating recruitment of Polycomb
repressive complex-2 (PRC2; see 601573) to CpG-rich gene promoters.
Thus, Wu et al. (2011) concluded that their study not only establishes a
role for Tet1 in modulating DNA methylation levels at CpG-rich
promoters, but also reveals a dual function of Tet1 in promoting
transcription of pluripotency factors as well as participating in the
repression of Polycomb-targeted developmental regulators.

Pastor et al. (2011) described 2 novel and specific approaches to
profile the genomic localization of 5hmC. The first approach, which they
called GLIB (glucosylation, periodate oxidation, biotinylation), uses a
combination of enzymatic and chemical steps to isolate DNA fragments
containing as few as a single 5hmC. The second approach involves
conversion of 5hmC to cytosine 5-methylenesulfonate (CMS) by treatment
of genomic DNA with sodium bisulfite, followed by immunoprecipitation of
CMS-containing DNA with a specific antiserum to CMS. High-throughout
sequencing of 5hmC-containing DNA from mouse embryonic stem cells showed
strong enrichment within exons and near transcriptional start sites.
5hmC was especially enriched at the start sites of genes whose promoters
bear dual histone-3 lysine-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and histone-3
lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) marks. Pastor et al. (2011) concluded
that 5hmC has a probable role in transcriptional regulation, and
suggested a model in which 5hmC contributes to the 'poised' chromatin
signature found at developmentally-regulated genes in embryonic stem
cells.

Ficz et al. (2011) used antibodies against 5hmC and 5mC together with
high-throughput sequencing to determine genomewide patterns of
methylation and hydroxymethylation in mouse wildtype and mutant ES cells
and differentiating embryoid bodies. They found that 5hmC is mostly
associated with euchromatin and that whereas 5mC is underrepresented at
gene promoters and CpG islands, 5hmC is enriched and is associated with
increased transcriptional levels. Most, if not all, 5hmC in the genome
depends on preexisting 5mC and the balance between these 2 modifications
is different between genomic regions. Knockdown of Tet1 and Tet2 causes
downregulation of a group of genes that includes pluripotency-related
genes (Esrrb, 602167; Prdm14, 611781; Dppa3, 608408; Klf2, 602016; Tcl1,
186960; and Zfp42) and a concomitant increase in methylation of their
promoters, together with an increased propensity of ES cells for
extraembryonic lineage differentiation. Declining levels of TETs during
differentiation are associated with decreased hydroxymethylation levels
at the promoters of ES cell-specific genes together with increased
methylation and gene silencing. Ficz et al. (2011) proposed that the
balance between hydroxymethylation and methylation in the genome is
inextricably linked with the balance between pluripotency and lineage
commitment.

Ito et al. (2011) showed that, in addition to 5hmC, the Tet proteins can
generate 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) from 5mC
in an enzymatic activity-dependent manner. Furthermore, Ito et al.
(2011) revealed the presence of 5fC and 5caC in genomic DNA of mouse
embryonic stem cells and mouse organs. The genomic content of 5hmC, 5fC,
and 5caC can be increased or reduced through overexpression or depletion
of Tet proteins. Thus, Ito et al. (2011) concluded that they identified
2 previously unknown cytosine derivatives in genomic DNA as the products
of Tet proteins, and raised the possibility that DNA demethylation may
occur through Tet-catalyzed oxidation followed by decarboxylation.

He et al. (2011) demonstrated that 5mC and 5hmC in DNA are oxidized to
5caC by Tet dioxygenases in vitro and in cultured cells. 5caC is
specifically recognized and excised by thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG;
601423). Depletion of TDG in mouse embryonic stem cells leads to
accumulation of 5caC to a readily detectable level. He et al. (2011)
concluded that oxidation of 5mC by Tet proteins followed by TDG-mediated
base excision of 5caC constitutes a pathway for active DNA
demethylation.

Guo et al. (2011) found that transfection of HEK293 cells with TET1
induced DNA replication-independent demethylation of 5hmC in the context
of both CpG and non-CpG DNA. Pharmacologic inhibition of the base
excision repair enzymes PARP (see 173870) or APE1 (APEX1; 107748)
reduced demethylation of 5hmC DNA. Expression of the cytidine deaminase
AID (AICDA; 605257) or of the APOBEC cytidine deaminases mouse Apobec1
(600130) or human APOBEC2 (604797), APOBEC3A (607109), APOBEC3C
(607750), or APOBEC3E (APOBEC3D; 609900), but not APOBEC3B (607110) or
APOBEC3G (607113), significantly increased demethylation of 5hmC DNA.
Overexpression of TET1 or AID in adult mouse dentate gyrus via
adenovirus-mediated gene transfer increased and decreased 5hmC levels,
respectively, and resulted in upregulated expression of brain-specific
variants of Bdnf (113505) and Fgf1 (131220). Knockdown of endogenous
Tet1 or Apobec1 expression in adult dentate gyrus abolished
stimulation-induced demethylation of brain-specific Bdnf and Fgf1
promoters. Guo et al. (2011) concluded that TET1, AID, and APOBEC
cooperate in a base excision-mediated pathway of active DNA
demethylation.

Using a loss-of-function approach in mice, Yamaguchi et al. (2012)
showed that the 5mC-specific dioxygenase Tet1 has an important role in
regulating meiosis in mouse oocytes. Tet1 deficiency significantly
reduced female germ cell numbers and fertility. Univalent chromosomes
and unresolved DNA double-strand breaks were also observed in
Tet1-deficient oocytes. Tet1 deficiency does not greatly affect the
genomewide demethylation that takes place in primordial germ cells, but
leads to defective DNA demethylation and decreased expression of a
subset of meiotic genes. Yamaguchi et al. (2012) concluded that their
study established a function for Tet1 in meiosis and meiotic gene
activation in female germ cells.

Mouse primordial germ cells (PGCs) undergo sequential epigenetic changes
and genomewide DNA demethylation to reset the epigenome for totipotency.
Hackett et al. (2013) demonstrated that erasure of CpG methylation in
PGCs occurs via conversion to 5hmC, driven by high levels of Tet1 and
Tet2 (612839). Global conversion to 5hmC initiates asynchronously among
PGCs at embryonic day (E) 9.5 to E10.5 and accounts for the unique
process of imprint erasure. Mechanistically, 5hmC enrichment is followed
by its protracted decline thereafter at a rate consistent with
replication-coupled dilution. The conversion to 5hmC is an important
component of parallel redundant systems that drive comprehensive
reprogramming in PGCs. Nonetheless, Hackett et al. (2013) identified
rare regulatory elements that escape systematic DNA demethylation in
PGCs, providing a potential mechanistic basis for transgenerational
epigenetic inheritance.

Using enhanced purification techniques and a stringent computational
algorithm, Costa et al. (2013) identified 27 high-confidence protein
interaction partners of Nanog (607937) in mouse embryonic stem cells.
These consisted of 19 partners of Nanog, including the ten-eleven
translocation (TET) family methylcytosine hydroxylase Tet1. Costa et al.
(2013) confirmed physical association of Nanog with Tet1, and
demonstrated that Tet1, in synergy with Nanog, enhanced the efficiency
of reprogramming. Costa et al. (2013) also found physical association
and reprogramming synergy of Tet2 with Nanog, and demonstrated that
knockdown of Tet2 abolished the reprogramming synergy of Nanog with a
catalytically deficient mutant of Tet1. These results indicated that the
physical interaction between Nanog and Tet1/Tet2 proteins facilitates
reprogramming in a manner that is dependent on the catalytic activity of
Tet1/Tet2. Tet1 and Nanog cooccupy genomic loci of genes associated with
both maintenance of pluripotency and lineage commitment in embryonic
stem cells, and Tet1 binding is reduced upon Nanog depletion.
Coexpression of Nanog and Tet1 increased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels
at the top-ranked common target loci Esrrb (602167) and Oct4 (164177),
resulting in priming of their expression before reprogramming to naive
pluripotency. Costa et al. (2013) proposed that TET1 is recruited by
NANOG to enhance the expression of a subset of key reprogramming target
genes.

Blaschke et al. (2013) reported that addition of vitamin C to mouse
embryonic stem cells promotes Tet activity, leading to a rapid and
global increase in 5hmC. This is followed by DNA demethylation of many
gene promoters and upregulation of demethylated germline genes. Tet1
binding is enriched near the transcription start site of genes affected
by vitamin C treatment. Importantly, vitamin C, but not other
antioxidants, enhances the activity of recombinant Tet1 in a biochemical
assay, and the vitamin C-induced changes in 5hmC and 5mC are entirely
suppressed in Tet1 and Tet2 (612839) double-knockout embryonic stem
cells. Vitamin C has a stronger effect on regions that gain methylation
in cultured embryonic stem cells compared to blastocysts, and in vivo
are methylated only after implantation. In contrast, imprinted regions
and intracisternal A particle retroelements, which are resistant to
demethylation in the early embryo, are resistant to vitamin C-induced
DNA demethylation. Blaschke et al. (2013) concluded that the results of
this study established vitamin C as a direct regulator of Tet activity
and DNA methylation fidelity in embryonic stem cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ono et al. (2002) found that the TET1 gene consists of at least 12
exons.

MAPPING

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using expression cloning, Lacey et al. (1998) identified the ligand for
osteoprotegerin (OPG; 602643). The OPG ligand (OPGL) is a TNF-related
cytokine that replaces the requirement for stromal cells, vitamin D3,
and glucocorticoids in the coculture model of in vitro
osteoclastogenesis. The OPG ligand, which contains 317 amino acids,
binds to a unique hematopoietic progenitor cell that is committed to the
osteoclast lineage and stimulates the rapid induction of genes that
typify osteoclast development. The OPGL gene is mainly expressed in
lymph nodes and bone marrow stromal cells. In the skeleton, OPGL is
expressed in the primitive mesenchymal cells, in hypertrophying
chondrocytes, and in areas undergoing primary ossification and modeling.
OPGL directly activates isolated mature osteoclasts in vitro, and
short-term administration into normal adult mice results in osteoclast
activation associated with systemic hypercalcemia. These data suggested
to Lacey et al. (1998) that OPGL is an osteoclast differentiation and
activation factor. The effects of OPGL are blocked in vitro and in vivo
by OPG, suggesting that OPGL and OPG are key extracellular regulators of
osteoclast development.

Anderson et al. (1997), Wong et al. (1997), and Yasuda et al. (1998)
independently cloned OPGL cDNAs. Anderson et al. (1997) identified OPGL,
which they called RANKL for 'receptor activator of NF-kappa-B (164011)
ligand,' as a ligand for the TNF (191160) receptor RANK (603499). RANKL
augmented the ability of dendritic cells to stimulate naive T-cell
proliferation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction and increased the survival
of RANK+ T cells generated with IL4 (147780) and TGF-beta. The predicted
317-amino acid RANKL protein is a type II transmembrane protein. Human
and mouse RANKL share 85% protein sequence identity. Northern blot
analysis revealed that RANKL is expressed predominantly in lymph node.
Wong et al. (1997) reported that a soluble form of OPGL, or TRANCE
(TNF-related activation-induced cytokine), consisting only of the
extracellular domain, can activate JNK (see 602896) in T cells but not
in B cells or bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. They suggested that
TRANCE plays a specific role in regulating T-cell functions. Yasuda et
al. (1998) referred to OPGL as ODF, osteoclast differentiation factor.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell and radiation hybrids, Anderson et al.
(1997) mapped the RANKL gene to chromosome 13q14. Using an interspecific
backcross, Wong et al. (1997) mapped the Trance gene to mouse chromosome
14.

GENE FUNCTION

TRANCE, a TNF family member, and its receptor, RANK, are critical
regulators of dendritic cell and osteoclast function. Wong et al. (1999)
demonstrated that TRANCE activates the antiapoptotic serine/threonine
kinase PKB (AKT1; 164730) through a signaling complex involving SRC
(190090) and TRAF6 (602355). A deficiency in SRC or addition of SRC
family kinase inhibitors blocked TRANCE-mediated PKB activation in
osteoclasts. SRC and TRAF6 interacted with each other and with RANK upon
receptor engagement. TRAF6, in turn, enhanced the kinase activity of
SRC, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream signaling
molecules such as CBL (165360). These results defined a mechanism by
which TRANCE activates SRC family kinases and PKB, and provided evidence
of cross-talk between TRAF proteins and SRC family kinases.

Kong et al. (1999) reported that activated T cells can directly trigger
osteoclastogenesis through OPGL. Systemic activation of T cells in vivo
leads to an OPGL-mediated increase in osteoclastogenesis and bone loss.
In a T-cell-dependent model of rat adjuvant arthritis characterized by
severe joint inflammation, bone and cartilage destruction, and
crippling, blocking of OPGL through osteoprotegerin treatment at the
onset of disease prevents bone and cartilage destruction but not
inflammation. These results show that both systemic and local T-cell
activation can lead to OPGL production and subsequent bone loss, and
they provide a novel paradigm for T cells as regulators of bone
physiology.

Bone destruction, caused by aberrant production and activation of
osteoclasts, is a prominent feature of multiple myeloma (254500). Pearse
et al. (2001) demonstrated that myeloma stimulates osteoclastogenesis by
triggering a coordinated increase in TRANCE and decrease in its decoy
receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG; 602643). Immunohistochemistry and in situ
hybridization studies of bone marrow specimens indicated that, in vivo,
deregulation of the TRANCE-OPG cytokine axis occurred in myeloma, but
not in the limited plasma cell disorder monoclonal gammopathy of unknown
significance or in nonmyeloma hematologic malignancies. In coculture,
myeloma cell lines stimulated expression of TRANCE and inhibited
expression of OPG by stromal cells. In the murine model of human
myeloma, administration of a recombinant Trance inhibitor, Rank-Fc, both
prevented myeloma-induced bone destruction and interfered with myeloma
progression. These data identified TRANCE and OPG as key cytokines whose
deregulation promotes bone destruction and supports myeloma growth.

Croucher et al. (2001) demonstrated that myeloma cells express the
critical osteoclastogenic factor RANKL. Injection of myeloma cells into
a C57BL strain of mice resulted in development of bone disease
characterized by a significant decrease in cancellous bone volume in the
tibial and femoral metaphyses, an increase in osteoclast formation, and
radiologic evidence of osteolytic bone lesions. Treatment of mice with
established myeloma with recombinant OPG protein, the soluble decoy
receptor for RANKL, prevented the development of lytic bone lesions. OPG
treatment was associated with preservation of cancellous bone volume and
inhibition of osteoclast formation. OPG also promoted an increase in
femoral, tibial, and vertebral BMD. The data suggested that the
RANKL/RANK/OPG system may play a critical role in the development of
osteolytic bone disease in multiple myeloma and that targeting this
system may have therapeutic potential.

Sezer et al. (2003) reviewed the role of RANKL and OPG in myeloma bone
disease, the net effect of which is an increased RANKL-to-OPG ratio that
favors the formation and activation of osteoclasts. They noted that
patients with myeloma bone disease have inappropriately low serum and
bone marrow levels of OPG, and pointed out that specific blockade of
RANKL prevented the skeletal complications in various animal models of
myeloma and suppressed bone resorption in a preliminary study of
patients with myeloma bone disease.

Eghbali-Fatourechi et al. (2003) studied RANKL expression in bone marrow
mononuclear cells of 12 premenopausal women, 12 early-postmenopausal
women, and 12 age-matched estrogen-treated postmenopausal women, and
found that the surface concentration of RANKL per cell was 2- to 3-fold
higher in the untreated postmenopausal women compared to the other 2
groups. In the merged groups, increased RANKL expression per cell
correlated directly with increases in bone resorption markers and
inversely with serum 17-beta-estradiol levels.

Takayanagi et al. (2002) demonstrated that RANKL induces the IFN-beta
(147640) gene in osteoclast precursor cells, and that IFN-beta inhibits
the differentiation of osteoclasts by interfering with the RANKL-induced
expression of c-Fos (164810), an essential transcription factor for the
formation of osteoclasts. This IFN-beta gene induction mechanism is
distinct from that induced by virus, and is dependent on c-Fos itself.
Thus an autoregulatory mechanism operates--the RANKL-induced c-Fos
induces its own inhibitor. The importance of this regulatory mechanism
for bone homeostasis is emphasized by the observation that mice
deficient in IFN-beta signaling exhibit severe osteopenia accompanied by
enhanced osteoclastogenesis.

As explained by Glass et al. (2003), elevated serum levels of RANKL
occur in patients with myeloma, reflecting secretion by myeloma cells
with enhancement of osteoclast activity. The elevated serum levels of
DKK1 (605189) and RANKL in patients with myeloma may act systemically
and thus contribute to diffuse osteopenia and hypercalcemia that
frequently accompany this condition.

Koga et al. (2004) showed that mice lacking immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-harboring adaptors Fc receptor
common gamma subunit (147139) and DNAX-activating protein-12 (DAP12;
604142) exhibit severe osteopetrosis owing to impaired osteoclast
differentiation. In osteoclast precursor cells, Fc receptor-gamma and
DAP12 associated with multiple immunoreceptors and activated calcium
signaling through phospholipase C-gamma (see 172420). Thus,
ITAM-dependent costimulatory signals activated by multiple
immunoreceptors are essential for the maintenance of bone homeostasis.
Koga et al. (2004) concluded that RANKL and macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (120420) are not sufficient to activate the
signals required for osteoclastogenesis.

The treatment of AIDS with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART),
which includes HIV protease inhibitors, has been associated with bone
demineralization. To determine if this complication reflects accelerated
resorptive activity, Wang et al. (2004) studied the impact of 2 common
HIV protease inhibitors, ritonavir and indinavir, on osteoclast
formation and function. They found that ritonavir, but not indinavir,
inhibited osteoclast differentiation in a reversible manner and also
abrogated bone resorption by disrupting the osteoclast cytoskeleton,
without affecting cell number. Given in vivo, ritonavir completely
blunted parathyroid hormone (168450)-induced osteoclastogenesis in mice,
which confirmed that the drug is bone sparing. Wang et al. (2004) showed
that ritonavir functions by impairing RANKL-induced signaling. They
suggested that ritonavir may represent a bone-sparing protease inhibitor
capable of preventing development of osteopenia in patients on HAART.

TNF-induced RANKL synthesis by bone marrow stromal cells is a
fundamental component of inflammatory osteolysis. Wei et al. (2005)
found that TNF-induced RANKL expression in murine stromal cells was
mediated by IL1 (IL1A; 147760) via enhanced expression of IL1R1 (147810)
. IL1 had the capacity to directly target mononuclear osteoclast
precursors and promote their differentiation in the presence of
sufficient RANKL. Wei et al. (2005) concluded that IL1 is a key
downstream effector molecule in optimal TNF-induced osteoclastogenesis,
participating in the stimulation of stromal cell RANKL expression and in
the stimulation of osteoclast precursor differentiation.

Ikeda et al. (2004) generated transgenic mice expressing
dominant-negative c-Jun (165160) specifically in the osteoclast lineage
and found that they developed severe osteopetrosis due to impaired
osteoclastogenesis. Blockade of c-Jun signaling also markedly inhibited
soluble RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation in vitro.
Overexpression of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATC2; 600490)
or NFATC1 (600489) promoted differentiation of osteoclast precursor
cells into tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive (TRAP-positive)
multinucleated osteoclast-like cells even in the absence of RANKL. These
osteoclastogenic activities of NFAT were abrogated by overexpression of
dominant-negative c-Jun. Ikeda et al. (2004) concluded that c-Jun
signaling in cooperation with NFAT is crucial for RANKL-regulated
osteoclast differentiation.

Jones et al. (2006) demonstrated that the cytokine RANKL triggers
migration of human epithelial cancer cells and melanoma cells that
express the receptor RANK (603499). RANK is expressed on cancer cell
lines and breast cancer cells in patients. In a mouse model of melanoma
metastasis, in vivo neutralization of RANKL by osteoprotegerin (602643)
results in complete protection from paralysis and a marked reduction in
tumor burden in bones but not in other organs. Jones et al. (2006)
concluded that local differentiation factors such as RANKL have an
important role in cell migration and the tissue-specific metastatic
behavior of cancer cells.

Using immunofluorescence microscopy, Loser et al. (2006) found that skin
from individuals with psoriasis (see 177900), but not skin from healthy
individuals or individuals with cutaneous lupus erythematosus, strongly
expressed RANKL in keratinocytes of all epidermal layers. In mice,
ultraviolet (UV) exposure induced Rankl expression. Transgenic mice
overexpressing Rankl under transcriptional control of the K14 (KRT14;
148066) promoter had reduced contact hypersensitivity (CHS) responses,
but showed no increase in circulating soluble Rankl. FACS analysis
showed that these transgenic mice had increased numbers of systemic Cd4
(186940)-positive/Cd25 (IL2RA; 147730)-positive T cells, whereas mice
lacking Rankl had markedly reduced numbers of these cells in spleen.
Confocal microscopy demonstrated coexpression of langerin (CD207;
604862) and Rank in Langerhans cells (LCs). Exposure of LCs to epidermal
Rankl made LCs less susceptible to apoptosis. Cutaneous Rankl expression
also reduced systemic Cd40l (CD40LG; 300386)-driven autoimmunity and
local cutaneous hyperallergic responses. Injection of Rank into
UV-irradiated mice resulted in protection from UV-induced
immunosuppression. Mice transplanted with Rankl -/- skin, but not
wildtype skin, had normal CHS responses, indicating protection from
UV-induced immunosuppression. Loser et al. (2006) concluded that RANKL
expression is inducible on keratinocytes and that this molecular pathway
couples the epidermis to local and systemic immunosuppression.

Hanada et al. (2009) reported that RANKL and RANK have an essential role
in the brain. In both mice and rats, central RANKL injections trigger
severe fever. Using tissue-specific Nestin-Cre and GFAP-Cre rank(floxed)
deleter mice, Hanada et al. (2009) genetically mapped the function of
RANK in the fever response to astrocytes. Importantly, Nestin-Cre and
GFAP-Cre rank(floxed) deleter mice are resistant to
lipopolysaccharide-induced fever as well as fever in response to the key
inflammatory cytokines IL-1-beta (147720) and TNF-alpha (191160).
Mechanistically, RANKL activates brain regions involved in
thermoregulation and induces fever via the COX2-PGE2 (see 600262)/EP3R
(176806) pathway. Moreover, female Nestin (600915)-Cre and GFAP
(137780)-Cre rank(floxed) mice exhibit increased basal body
temperatures, suggesting that RANKL and RANK control thermoregulation
during normal female physiology. Hanada et al. (2009) also found that 2
children with RANK mutations (see 603499.0003) exhibited impaired fever
during pneumonia. Hanada et al. (2009) concluded that their data
identified an entirely novel and unexpected function for the key
osteoclast differentiation factors RANKL/RANK in female thermoregulation
and the central fever response in inflammation.

Asselin-Labat et al. (2010) showed that mouse mammary stem cells (MaSCs)
are highly responsive to steroid hormone signaling, despite lacking the
estrogen and progesterone receptors. Ovariectomy markedly diminished
MaSC number and outgrowth potential in vivo, whereas MaSC activity
increased in mice treated with estrogen plus progesterone. Notably, even
3 weeks of treatment with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole was
sufficient to reduce the MaSC pool. In contrast, pregnancy led to a
transient 11-fold increase in MaSC numbers, probably mediated through
paracrine signaling from the RANK ligand. The augmented MaSC pool
indicates a cellular basis for the short-term increase in breast cancer
incidence that accompanies pregnancy. Asselin-Labat et al. (2010)
concluded that their findings further indicated that breast cancer
chemoprevention may be achieved, in part, through suppression of MaSC
function.

Joshi et al. (2010) showed that the MaSC pool increases 14-fold during
maximal progesterone levels at the luteal diestrus phase of the mouse.
Stem cell-enriched CD49f(hi) cells amplify at diestrus, or with
exogenous progesterone, demonstrating a key role for progesterone in
propelling this expansion. In aged mice, CD49f(hi) cells display stasis
upon cessation of the reproductive cycle. Progesterone drives a series
of events where luminal cells probably provide Wnt4 (603490) and Rankl
signals to basal cells which in turn respond by upregulating their
cognate receptors, transcriptional targets, and cell cycle markers.
Joshi et al. (2010) concluded that their findings uncovered a dynamic
role for progesterone in activating adult MaSCs within the mammary stem
cell niche during the reproductive cycle, where MaSCs are putative
targets for cell transformation events leading to breast cancer.

Schramek et al. (2010) demonstrated that in vivo administration of
medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), used in women for hormone replacement
therapy and contraceptives, triggers massive induction of the key
osteoclast differentiation factor RANKL in mammary gland epithelial
cells. Genetic inactivation of the RANKL receptor RANK in mammary gland
epithelial cells prevented MPA-induced epithelial proliferation,
impaired expansion of CD49f(hi) stem cell-enriched population, and
sensitized these cells to DNA damage-induced cell death. Deletion of
RANK from the mammary epithelium resulted in a markedly decreased
incidence and delayed onset of MPA-driven mammary cancer. Schramek et
al. (2010) concluded that the RANKL/RANK system controls the incidence
and onset of progestin-driven breast cancer.

Gonzalez-Suarez et al. (2010) showed that RANK and RANKL are expressed
within normal, premalignant, and neoplastic mammary epithelium, and,
using complementary gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches,
defined a direct contribution of this pathway in mammary tumorigenesis.
Accelerated preneoplasias and increased mammary tumor formation were
observed in MMTV-RANK transgenic mice after multiparity or treatment
with carcinogen and hormone (progesterone). Reciprocally, selective
pharmacologic inhibition of RANKL attenuated mammary tumor development
not only in hormone- and carcinogen-treated MMTV-RANK and wildtype mice,
but also in the MMTV-neu transgenic spontaneous tumor model. The
reduction in tumorigenesis upon RANKL inhibition was preceded by a
reduction in preneoplasias as well as rapid and sustained reductions in
hormone- and carcinogen-induced mammary epithelial proliferation and
cyclin D1 (168461) levels. Gonzalez-Suarez et al. (2010) concluded that
RANKL inhibition is acting directly on hormone-induced mammary
epithelium at early stages in tumorigenesis, and the permissive
contribution of progesterone to increased mammary cancer incidence is
due to RANKL-dependent proliferative changes in the mammary epithelium.

Tan et al. (2011) examined whether RANKL, RANK (603499), and IKK-alpha
(600664) are involved in mammary/breast cancer metastasis. RANK
signaling in mammary carcinoma cells that overexpress the protooncogene
Erbb2 (also known as Neu; 164870), which is frequently amplified in
metastatic human breast cancers, was important for pulmonary metastasis.
Metastatic spread of Erbb2-transformed carcinoma cells also required
CD4(186940)+CD25(147730)+ T cells, whose major prometastatic function
was RANKL production. Most RANKL-producing T cells expressed FOXP3
(300292), a transcription factor produced by regulatory T cells, and
were located next to smooth muscle actin (see 102540)-positive stromal
cells in mouse and human breast cancers. The dependence of pulmonary
metastasis on T cells was replaceable by exogenous RANKL, which also
stimulated pulmonary metastasis of RANK-positive human breast cancer
cells. Tan et al. (2011) concluded that their results were consistent
with the adverse impact of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ or FOXP3+ T cells on
human breast cancer prognosis and suggested that the targeting of
RANKL-RANK can be used in conjunction with the therapeutic elimination
of primary breast tumors to prevent recurrent metastatic disease.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Luan et al. (2012) reported the 2.7-angstrom crystal structure of the
human RANKL trimer in complex with the N-terminal fragment of human OPG
containing 4 cys-rich TNFR homologous domains (OPG-CRD). Structure-based
mutagenesis and surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that the RANKL
trimer uses 3 equivalent grooves between 2 neighboring monomers to
interact with 3 OPG-CRD monomers symmetrically. The results revealed
that OPG exerts its decoy receptor function by directly blocking the
accessibility of important interacting residues of RANKL, including
arg223, tyr241, and lys257, for RANK recognition.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Sobacchi et al. (2007) analyzed the TNFSF11 gene in 6 patients from 4
unrelated families with an autosomal recessive osteoclast-poor form of
osteopetrosis (OPTB2; 259710) that was unresponsive to hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation and identified homozygosity for 3 different
mutations in all affected individuals: a 5-bp deletion (602642.0001) in
a consanguineous Tunisian family, a missense mutation (M199K;
602642.0002) in 2 Sikh families, and a 2-bp deletion (602642.0003) in a
consanguineous Kurdish family. Exogenous RANKL induced formation of
functional osteoclasts in vitro from peripheral blood monocytes obtained
from these patients.

In a genomewide association study to find common sequence variants that
influence bone mineral density and low-trauma fractures in 3 populations
of European descent, Styrkarsdottir et al. (2008) identified 2
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a linkage disequilibrium block
adjacent to the RANKL gene on chromosome 13q14 (see BMND9, 612110).

ANIMAL MODEL

Osteoprotegerin ligand (OPGL) is a key osteoclast
differentiation/activation factor essential for bone remodeling. Fata et
al. (2000) reported that mice lacking OPGL or its receptor RANK failed
to form lobulo-alveolar mammary structures during pregnancy, resulting
in death of newborns. Transplantation and OPGL-rescue experiments in
Opgl -/- and Rank -/- pregnant females showed that OPGL acts directly on
RANK-expressing mammary epithelial cells. The effects of OPGL were
autonomous to epithelial cells. The mammary gland defect in female Opgl
-/- mice was characterized by enhanced apoptosis and failures in
proliferation and PKB activation in lobulo-alveolar buds that could be
reversed by recombinant OPGL treatment.

Kim et al. (2000) reported the skeletal phenotype of TRANCE-deficient
mice and its rescue by the TRANCE transgene specifically expressed in
lymphocytes. TRANCE-deficient mice showed severe osteopetrosis, with no
osteoclasts, marrow spaces, or tooth eruption, and exhibited profound
growth retardation at several skeletal sites, including the limbs,
skull, and vertebrae. These mice had marked chondrodysplasia, with
thick, irregular growth plates and a relative increase in hypertrophic
chondrocytes. Transgenic overexpression of TRANCE in lymphocytes of
TRANCE-deficient mice rescued osteoclast development in 2 locations in
growing long bones: excavation of marrow cavities permitting
hematopoiesis in the marrow spaces, and remodeling of osteopetrotic
woven bone in the shafts of long bones into histologically normal
lamellar bone. However, osteoclasts in these mice were not present at
the chondroosseous junction and the metaphyseal periosteum of long
bones, or in tooth eruption pathways. These defects resulted in
sclerotic metaphyses with persistence of club-shaped long bones and
unerupted teeth, and the growth plate defects were largely unimproved by
the TRANCE transgene. Thus, TRANCE-mediated regulation of the skeleton
is complex, and impacts chondrocyte differentiation and osteoclast
formation in a manner that likely requires local delivery of TRANCE.

Nakashima et al. (2011) generated mice expressing green fluorescent
protein specifically in osteocytes and found that Rankl mRNA and protein
expression was more than 10-fold higher in osteocytes than in
osteoblasts. Furthermore, osteocytes had a more potent ability to
support osteoclastogenesis than osteoblasts. Mice lacking Rankl in
osteocytes had a severe osteopetrotic phenotype. Nakashima et al. (2011)
concluded that osteocytes are a crucial, if not exclusive, source of
RANKL required for osteoclastogenesis.

Using mice with conditional deletion of Rankl in genetically defined
cell populations, Xiong et al. (2011) identified hypertrophic
chondrocytes and osteocytes, both of which are embedded within
mineralized cartilage, as essential sources of the Rankl that controls
resorption of mineralized cartilage and bone remodeling, respectively.
Mice lacking Rankl in osteocytes were protected from bone loss owing to
unloading. Xiong et al. (2011) concluded that RANKL produced by
osteoblasts or their progenitors does not contribute to adult bone
remodeling and suggested that the rate-limiting step of matrix
resorption is controlled by cells embedded within the matrix itself.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OSTEOPETROSIS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 2
TNFSF11, 5-BP DEL, IVS7+4

In a 6-year-old boy with osteoclast-poor osteopetrosis (OPTB2; 259710),
born of consanguineous Tunisian parents, Sobacchi et al. (2007)
identified homozygosity for a 5-bp deletion in intron 7 (532+4_532+8del)
of the TNFSF11 gene, predicted to cause skipping of exon 7 and an
in-frame deletion. The parents and 1 healthy brother were heterozygous
for the mutation; exon skipping was confirmed in cells from the
heterozygous brother. The mutation was not found in another healthy
brother or 120 geographically-matched control chromosomes.

.0002
OSTEOPETROSIS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 2
TNFSF11, MET199LYS

In 2 sisters, aged 11 years and 6 years, and a 7-month-old boy with
osteoclast-poor osteopetrosis (259710), from 2 unrelated Sikh families
that were both apparently nonconsanguineous, Sobacchi et al. (2007)
identified homozygosity for a 596T-A transversion in exon 8 of the
TNFSF11 gene, resulting in a met199-to-lys (M199K) substitution at a
highly conserved residue. The parents were all heterozygous for the
mutation, which was not found in 100 control chromosomes from an
unmatched population or in 120 control chromosomes from a Sikh
population.

.0003
OSTEOPETROSIS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 2
TNFSF11, 2-BP DEL, 828CG

In 2 female cousins, aged 12 years and 3 months, respectively, with
osteoclast-poor osteopetrosis (259710), both born of consanguineous
Kurdish parents, Sobacchi et al. (2007) identified homozygosity for a
2-bp deletion (828delCG) in the last exon of the TNFSF11 gene. The
deletion results in a frameshift and a premature termination codon
predicted to cause loss of the beta-G, beta-H, and beta-F strands of
TNFSF11, which are important for its trimerization.

614657	TITLE *614657 ANGIOMOTIN-LIKE 1; AMOTL1
;;JUNCTION-ENRICHED AND -ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; JEAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to angiomotin (AMOT;
300410), Bratt et al. (2002) identified AMOTL1 and AMOTL2 (614658). The
deduced 956-amino acid AMOTL1 protein contains a conserved N-terminal
glutamine-rich domain, followed by 2 coiled-coil domains and a
C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. AMOTL1 and AMOTL2 lack the angiostatin
(173350)-binding domain found in angiomotin. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected an approximately 8.3-kb Amotl1 transcript that
was highly expressed in brain, heart, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and
uterus, with much lower expression in most other tissues.

Nishimura et al. (2002) cloned mouse Amotl1, which they called Jeap. The
deduced 882-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 98.4
kD. Jeap has an N-terminal polyglutamic acid repeat, followed by a
central coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif.
Fluorescence-tagged Jeap colocalized with Zo1 (TJP1; 601009) at tight
junctions along the apical regions of lateral membranes of transfected
canine kidney cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse tissues
detected Jeap expression in exocrine glands, including pancreas,
submandibular gland, lacrimal gland, parotid gland, and sublingual
gland, but not in brain, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, gall bladder, or
duodenum. In exocrine glands, Jeap localized to the terminal portion of
serous glands. It did not localize to any endothelial cells. Western
blot analysis detected Jeap at an apparent molecular mass of about 105
kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (2012) found that overexpression of AMOT, AMOTL1, or AMOTL2 in
HEK293T cells repressed WNT1 (164820)-dependent activation of a reporter
gene. Conversely, knockdown of all 3 genes simultaneously via small
hairpin RNA significantly increased WNT1 reporter gene activity.
However, knockdown of AMOT, AMOTL1, or AMOTL2 individually had little
effect, suggesting that they have overlapping functions in repressing
WNT activity.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the AMOTL1 gene to chromosome 11q21 based on an
alignment of the AMOTL1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF453742) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

EVOLUTION

Phylogenetic analysis by Bratt et al. (2002) suggested that angiomotin,
AMOTL1, and AMOTL2 form separate clades and that these clades arose from
a duplication of a common ancestral sequence.

DESCRIPTION Receptors for the Fc region (FcRs) of immunoglobulins (Igs) modulate
cellular and humoral immunity by linking their antibody ligands with
effector cells of the immune system. FcRs sense humoral concentrations
of antibody, initiate cellular responses in host defense, and
participate in autoimmune disorders.

CLONING

By EST database searching for immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory
motif (ITIM)-bearing receptor proteins, Xu et al. (2001) identified a
cDNA encoding SPAP1A (SH2 domain-containing phosphatase anchor
protein-1A). The deduced 255-amino acid transmembrane protein contains 2
ITIMs. Further searches and sequencing identified a 192-amino acid
splice variant, SPAP1B, lacking the intracellular ITIMs, and a 144-amino
acid isoform, SPAP1C, lacking the transmembrane segment. RT-PCR analysis
detected SPAP1A expression in spleen, peripheral blood, bone marrow, and
B-cell lines, but not in other tissues. SPAP1C was also detected in
Jurkat and B-cell lines but SPAP1B was not detected in any samples
tested. Western blot analysis showed expression of SPAP1A as a 38- and
40-kD doublet protein reduced to 32 kD or 28 kD by N-glycosidase or
O-glycosidase treatment, respectively. Immunoblot analysis indicated
that SPAP1A ITIMs recruit the SHP1 (PTPN6; 176883), but not the SHP2
(PTPN11; 176876), tyrosine phosphatase, a major negative regulator of
hematopoietic cell signaling.

By database searching using a consensus sequence corresponding to the
second Ig-like domains of FCGR1A (146760), FCGR2A (146790), and FCGR3A
(146740) as well as the third Ig-like domain of the polymeric Ig
receptor (PIGR; 173880), Davis et al. (2001) identified 2 BAC clones
located at chromosome 1q21.1-q22. They found that one of these clones
contained 3 novel putative Ig superfamily genes, which they designated
FCRH1 (606508), FCRH2, and FCRH3 (606510), as well as 2 previously
identified members of this family, FCRH4 (IRTA1; 605876) and FCRH5
(IRTA2; 605877). Sequence analysis predicted that the 508-amino acid
type I transmembrane protein possesses a hydrophobic signal peptide, 4
extracellular C2 type Ig-like domains, 5 N-linked glycosylation sites,
an uncharged transmembrane segment, and an 86-amino acid cytoplasmic
tail with 1 ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif) and 2
ITIMs. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of approximately 3.0-,
4.4- and 5.5-kb transcripts chiefly in spleen and lymph nodes and a
2.4-kb transcript in kidney. RT-PCR analysis detected expression in
mature B-cell lines. Davis et al. (2001) suggested that FCRH2 may have
an activating/inhibitory or a fine-tuning role in regulation of
immunologic function.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Davis et al. (2001) determined that the
FCRH2 gene contains 12 exons that span approximately 30 kb.

MAPPING

By BAC and genomic sequence analysis, Davis et al. (2001) mapped the
FCRH2 gene to chromosome 1q21.2-q22, near the classic FCGR loci.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The 2-prime,5-prime oligoadenylate synthetases (OASs), such as OAS3, are
interferon-induced proteins characterized by their capacity to catalyze
the synthesis of 2-prime,5-prime oligomers of adenosine (2-5As)
(Hovnanian et al., 1998). For further information on OASs, see OAS1
(164350).

CLONING

Hovanessian et al. (1987) found that interferon-treated human cells
contain several OASs corresponding to proteins of 40 (OAS1), 46 (OAS1),
69 (OAS2; 603350), and 100 (OAS3) kD. Hovnanian et al. (1998) reported
that the predicted OAS3, or p100, protein contains 3 adjacent OAS1-like
domains. The domains share 44 to 60% protein sequence similarity with
each other and 42 to 60% sequence identity with the conserved domain of
OAS1. The authors noted that OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3 contain 1, 2, and 3
conserved OAS domains or units, respectively. Northern blot analysis
revealed that OAS3 is expressed as a 7-kb interferon-induced mRNA in
HeLa cells.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by inclusion within mapped
clones, Hovnanian et al. (1998) determined that the OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3
genes are clustered with a 130-kb region on chromosome 12q24.2.

103320	TITLE *103320 AGRIN; AGRN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Agrin is a neuronal aggregating factor that induces the aggregation of
acetylcholine receptors and other postsynaptic proteins on muscle fibers
and is crucial for the formation of the neuromuscular junction.

CLONING

Rupp et al. (1991) isolated cDNAs from a rat embryonic spinal cord
library using an agrin cDNA clone isolated from electromotor neurons of
a marine ray. Analysis of a set of clones predicted a protein with 1,940
amino acids, including 141 cysteine residues. The predicted protein had
9 domains homologous to protease inhibitors, a region similar to domain
III of laminin (see 150240), and 4 epidermal growth factor (131530)
repeats. The gene was expressed in rat embryonic nervous system and
muscle. The protein was concentrated at synapses. Rupp et al. (1992)
described alternative RNA splicing in mammalian agrin resulting in many
extracellular matrix protein isoforms.

MAPPING

Rupp et al. (1992) mapped the human AGRN gene to 1pter-p32 by analysis
of Chinese hamster/human somatic cell hybrids, including one that
carried chromosome 1 region p32-qter (which was negative for the human
signal). The mouse gene was mapped to chromosome 4 by study of Chinese
hamster/mouse somatic cell hybrids. Thus, this is another example of
extensive homology of synteny between 1pter-p32 and the distal half of
mouse chromosome 4. Three neurologic mutants in that region of mouse
chromosome 4 were pointed to as possible candidate diseases for
mutations in the Agrn gene.

GENE FUNCTION

An important event in synapse formation is the accumulation of
neurotransmitter receptors beneath the presynaptic nerve terminal. Agrin
is a component of the synaptic basal lamina that induces the clustering
(aggregation) of acetylcholine receptors (e.g., 100690) on cultured
muscle fibers. Campanelli et al. (1991) showed that when a cDNA encoding
a putative agrin protein is transfected into cells, the molecule is
secreted and concentrated on the extracellular surface. Coculture of
transfected cells with muscle fibers induced formation of receptor
patches at contact sites. These results demonstrated that expression of
a single gene encoding agrin confers receptor clustering that is
restricted to specific sites of contact between the synthesizing cell
and muscle. DeChiara et al. (1996) showed that agrin acts through the
skeletal muscle tyrosine kinase receptor MuSK (601296) to activate
signaling cascades responsible for all aspects of synapse formation,
including organization of the postsynaptic membrane, synapse-specific
transcription, and presynaptic differentiation. In mouse muscle and
cultured myotube cells, Finn et al. (2003) showed that the tyrosine
kinases Abl1 (189980) and Abl2 (164690) are concentrated at the
postsynaptic neuromuscular junction and are mediators of postsynaptic
AChR clustering downstream of agrin and MuSK signaling. The authors
suggested that the Abl kinases influence cytoskeletal regulatory
molecules important for synapse assembly and remodeling.

In cultured myocytes, Wang et al. (2003) found that agrin-induced AChR
postsynaptic aggregation required the tumor suppressor gene APC
(611731), which was found to colocalize and bind specifically to the
AChR beta subunit (100710). The interaction occurred downstream of MuSK
activation. Wang et al. (2003) suggested that a direct interaction
between APC and the AChR beta subunit may link AChR to the cytoskeleton,
helping to localize the receptors to the neuromuscular junction.

T-cell activation is dependent on both a primary signal delivered
through the T-cell receptor and a secondary costimulatory signal
mediated by coreceptors. Costimulation is thought to act through the
specific redistribution and clustering of membrane and intracellular
kinase-rich lipid raft microdomains at the contact site between T cells
and antigen-presenting cells. This site has been termed the immunologic
synapse. Khan et al. (2001) demonstrated that agrin, an aggregating
protein crucial for formation of the neuromuscular junction, is also
expressed in lymphocytes and is important in reorganization of membrane
lipid microdomains and setting the threshold for T-cell signaling. Khan
et al. (2001) concluded that agrin induces the aggregation of signaling
proteins and the creation of signaling domains in both immune and
nervous systems through a common lipid raft pathway.

In addition to its role at the neuromuscular junction, agrin has been
implicated in brain development. Through biochemical studies, Hilgenberg
et al. (2006) found that agrin bound the alpha-3 subunit of the
Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (ATP1A3; 182350) in mouse cortical neurons.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Atp1a3 colocalized with
agrin-binding sites at synapses. Agrin inhibited Atp1a3 activity,
resulting in membrane depolarization and increased action potential
frequency in mouse cortical neurons in culture and acute slice. An agrin
fragment that acted as a competitive antagonist depressed action
potential frequency, indicating that endogenous agrin regulates native
Atp1a3 function. Hilgenberg et al. (2006) concluded that agrin regulates
activity-dependent processes in neurons through its interaction with
ATP1A3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Swiss brother and sister with congenital myasthenic syndrome
(254300), Huze et al. (2009) identified a homozygous mutation in the
AGRN gene (G1709R; 103320.0001). Mutant agrin was expressed and
localized correctly in patient muscle, but the overall organization of
the neuromuscular junction was perturbed, affecting both the pre- and
postsynaptic regions. AChR clustering and density was not affected. The
findings suggested that agrin also helps to maintain the neuromuscular
junction.

ANIMAL MODEL

Data on the structure, expression, and bioactivity of agrin all support
the notion that it plays a central role in regulating postsynaptic
differentiation. However, agrin is only one of several agents that can
cause clustering of acetylcholine receptors in vitro. To test critically
the 'agrin hypothesis' (McMahan, 1990), Gautam et al. (1996) generated
knockout mice deficient for agrin and showed that neuromuscular
differentiation is grossly defective in these mice. Some postsynaptic
differentiation occurred in the mutant, suggesting the existence of a
second nerve-derived synaptic organizing signal.

Formation of the neuromuscular junction depends upon reciprocal
inductive interactions between the developing nerve and muscle,
resulting in the precise juxtaposition of a differentiated nerve
terminal with a highly specialized patch on the muscle membrane, termed
the motor endplate. Agrin is a nerve-derived factor involved in
induction of the molecular reorganization at the motor endplate. Glass
et al. (1996) found that mice lacking either agrin or the receptor
tyrosine kinase MuSK (601296) exhibit similar profound defects at the
neuromuscular junction. DeChiara et al. (1996) showed in knockout mice
that MuSK is required for formation of the neuromuscular junction in
vivo.

Lin et al. (2001) analyzed early stages of postsynaptic differentiation
in muscles of mutant mice lacking agrin, MuSK, rapsyn (601592), and/or
motor nerves. Lin et al. (2001) found that the defect in MuSK mutants is
due to an absence of initiation of postsynaptic differentiation, whereas
the impairment in agrin mutants is caused by loss of agrin-dependent
maintenance of the postsynaptic apparatus. On the basis of these and
previous studies, Lin et al. (2001) proposed the existence of 3 early
overlapping steps in the formation of the postsynaptic apparatus at the
neuromuscular junction. First, a muscle-intrinsic,
nerve/agrin-independent and MuSK-dependent mechanism initiates formation
of postsynaptic specialization in an end-plate band. Second,
nerve-derived agrin acts through MuSK to promote apposition of nerve
terminals to these nerve-independent acetylcholine receptor clusters
and/or to induce new postsynaptic sites. Agrin is also required for the
growth and maintenance of most, if not all, synaptic sites. Third, motor
axons, or Schwann cells that accompany them, provide an
agrin-independent signal that destabilizes or disperses postsynaptic
apparatus that have not been stabilized by agrin.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYASTHENIA, LIMB-GIRDLE, FAMILIAL
AGRN, GLY1709ARG

In a sister and brother with congenital myasthenic syndrome mostly
affecting the limb-girdle muscles (254300), Huze et al. (2009)
identified a homozygous 5125G-C transversion in exon 29 of the AGRN
gene, resulting in a gly1709-to-arg (G1709R) substitution in the
C-terminal laminin G-like 2 (LG2) domain. Both patients were unable to
run since childhood and had mild muscle weakness as adults. Neither had
diplopia, bulbar symptoms, or dyspnea. The mutation was not found in 200
control alleles. Skeletal muscle biopsy showed pre- and postsynaptic
defects at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), although mutant agrin
staining was localized correctly. In vitro functional expression studies
in myotubes showed that mutant agrin did not significantly impair AChR
clustering, activation of MuSK (601296), or the interaction with
alpha-dystroglycan (DAG; 128239). Injection of the mutant protein into
rat muscle did not affect AChR recruit or expression at the NMJ.
However, the NMJ showed remodeling and denervation: the presynaptic
department had disheveled neurofilaments, and the postsynaptic
compartment had increased synaptic gutter fragments. Huze et al. (2009)
concluded that the mutant agrin destabilized the preexisting NMJ,
suggesting that wildtype agrin is involved in the maintenance of the
NMJ.

;;FP REGULATORY PROTEIN; FPRP;;
CD9 PARTNER 1; CD9P1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Orlicky et al. (1996) isolated a protein that copurifies with bovine
prostaglandin F(2-alpha) receptor (PTGFR; 600563) and cloned the
corresponding rat cDNA. Transfection experiments suggested that this
protein, which the authors designated FP regulatory protein (FPRP),
inhibits binding of PGF(2-alpha) to PTGFR. Histologically, FPRP showed a
distribution coinciding well with those cells and tissues that respond
to PGF(2-alpha).

By screening cDNA libraries for sequences with the potential to encode
large proteins expressed in brain, Nagase et al. (2000) identified a
cDNA encoding FPRP, which they termed KIAA1436. The deduced 924-amino
acid protein was predicted to be 89% identical to rat Fprp. RT-PCR
analysis detected wide expression that was highest in ovary and lung.

By mass spectrometric and flow cytometric analyses of an
immunoprecipitated protein, CD9P1, that interacts with CD9 (143030) and
is expressed in HeLa cells, Charrin et al. (2001) determined that CD9P1
is identical to KIAA1436. SDS-PAGE analysis showed expression of a
135-kD protein under reducing conditions, which was lowered to 125 kD
and 106 kD by sialidase and N-glycanase treatments, respectively.
Further immunoprecipitation analysis showed that CD9P1 interacts with
CD81 (186845). Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated expression in
keratinocytes and, faintly, in salivary glands, but not in other
tissues. In contrast, CD9P1 was strongly expressed in a number of cancer
cell lines, suggesting a possible upregulation during tumorigenesis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Stipp et al. (2001) used moderately stringent Brij96/97 detergent
extraction to show that FPRP associates specifically with CD81 and CD9
but not with other tetraspanin molecules, such as CD151 (602243). They
determined that nearly all cell surface FPRP is associated with CD9 and
CD81.

MAPPING

Orlicky et al. (1996) subcloned and sequenced a portion of the 3-prime
untranslated region of the human homolog to FPRP, and oligonucleotide
primers were designed that allowed PCR amplification specifically of the
human FPRP sequence. Using these primers for PCR-based mapping, the FPRP
gene was localized to chromosome 1 through analysis of human/rodent
somatic cell hybrids and to 1p13.1-q21.3 by analysis of YAC pools.

610971	TITLE *610971 TRAFFICKING PROTEIN PARTICLE COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 4; TRAPPC4
;;SYNBINDIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ethell et al. (2000) cloned mouse Trappc4, which they called synbindin.
The deduced 219-amino acid protein contains segments of homology with
proteins involved in vesicular transport or synaptic function, including
a nonclassical PDZ domain, followed by a TRAPPC1 (610969)-like domain,
and a C-terminal tail similar to a short cytoplasmic segment of RYR2
(180902). By database analysis, Ethell et al. (2000) identified human
synbindin, which also encodes a 219-amino acid protein. Northern blot
analysis of several mouse tissues detected highest expression in liver
and skeletal muscle, followed by kidney, heart, and brain. RT-PCR, in
situ hybridization, and immunohistochemical analysis detected strong
synbindin expression in differentiated neurons. In adult mouse CNS,
expression was highest in large neurons such as pyramidal neurons,
Purkinje cells, and motor neurons and weak or undetectable in smaller
granule-type neurons. Immunogold electron microscopy of adult mouse
cerebral cortex detected synbindin predominantly in postsynaptic
membranes and postsynaptic densities, intracellular vesicles in the
dendritic shaft, membrane cisternae, and in the Golgi apparatus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid experiments, coimmunoprecipitation assays, and in
vitro pull-down assays, Ethell et al. (2000) demonstrated that mouse
synbindin interacted directly with rat syndecan-2 (SDC2; 142460). Yeast
2-hybrid analysis also showed that synbindin interacted with rat
syndecan-4 (SDC4; 600017). Mutation analysis showed that the interaction
required the PDZ-like domain of synbindin and the EFYA motif in the
C-terminal domain of Sdc2. Primary rat hippocampal neurons transfected
with synbindin and Sdc2 expressed the proteins in clusters along
dendritic spines. Sdc2 lacking the EFYA motif formed clusters that
lacked synbindin, suggesting synbindin clustering was dependent on Sdc2.
Ethell et al. (2000) concluded that synbindin has a role in postsynaptic
membrane trafficking.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TRAPPC4
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP WI-20793).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tissue-specific transcription is regulated in part by cell
type-restricted proteins that bind to defined sequences in target genes.
The DNA-binding domain of these proteins is often evolutionarily
conserved; on this basis, liver-enriched transcription factors have been
classified into various families. See, for example, HNF3A (602294) and
HNF1A (142410). Lemaigre et al. (1996) isolated from rat liver a
transcription factor, which they called hepatocyte nuclear factor-6,
that contains 2 different DNA-binding domains: a novel type of
homeodomain, and a homolog of the Drosophila cut domain. A similar
bipartite sequence had been found only in the genome of Caenorhabditis
elegans. The HNF6 cDNA encodes a deduced protein of 465 amino acids. By
RNase protection assay, the expression of HNF6 was found to be highest
in liver, but was also detectable in brain, spleen, and testis.

GENE FUNCTION

By RT-PCR, Jacquemin et al. (1999) determined the tissue distribution of
ONECUT1 in 12 human tissues. They found strong ONECUT1 expression in
liver and lower expression in testis and skin.

Vaisse et al. (1997) found that all members of the HNF3 family as well
as HNF4G (605966) and HNF6 are expressed in pancreatic beta cells. They
also identified and characterized simple tandem repeat DNA polymorphisms
in all of these genes.

Samadani and Costa (1996) determined that HNF6 activates transcription
of the promoters of HNF3B (600288) and TTR (176300). Further studies
suggested that HNF6 is important not only for the regulation of a wide
variety of genes expressed in hepatocytes and, putatively, intestinal
epithelium, but also for the inception of gut endoderm-derived organs
via activation of the HNF3B protein.

Glucocorticoids exert their effects on gene transcription through
ubiquitous receptors that bind to regulatory sequences present in many
genes. These glucocorticoid receptors are present in all cell types, yet
glucocorticoid action is controlled in a tissue-specific way. The
mechanism for this control relies on tissue-specific transcriptional
activators that bind in the vicinity of the glucocorticoid receptor and
are required for receptor action. Pierreux et al. (1999) described a
gene-specific and tissue-specific inhibitory mechanism through which
glucocorticoid action is repressed by a tissue-restricted transcription
factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor-6. HNF6 inhibits the
glucocorticoid-induced stimulation of 2 genes coding for enzymes of
liver glucose metabolism, namely 6-phosphofructo-2 kinase (PFKFB1;
311790) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1; 261680). Binding of
HNF6 to DNA is required for inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor
activity. In vitro and in vivo experiments suggested that this
inhibition is mediated by a direct HNF6/glucocorticoid receptor
interaction involving the N-terminal domain of HNF6 and the DNA-binding
domain of the receptor. Thus, in addition to its known property of
stimulating transcription of liver-expressed genes, HNF6 can antagonize
glucocorticoid-stimulated gene transcription.

To gain insight into the transcriptional regulatory networks that
specify and maintain human tissue diversity, Odom et al. (2004) used
chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with promoter microarrays to
identify systematically the genes occupied by the transcriptional
regulators HNF1-alpha, HNF4-alpha (600281), and HNF6, together with RNA
polymerase II (see 180660), in human liver and pancreatic islets. Odom
et al. (2004) identified tissue-specific regulatory circuits formed by
HNF1-alpha, HNF4-alpha, and HNF6 with other transcription factors,
revealing how these factors function as master regulators of hepatocyte
and islet transcription.

Odom et al. (2007) analyzed the binding of HNF3B, HNF1A, HNF4A, and HNF6
to 4,000 orthologous gene pairs in hepatocytes purified from human and
mouse livers. Despite the conserved function of these factors, 41 to 89%
of the binding events seemed to be species-specific. Importantly, the
binding sites varied widely between species in ways that could not be
predicted from human-mouse sequence alignments alone.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Vaisse et al. (1997) mapped the
HNF6A gene to 15q21.1-q21.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

During mouse development, Hnf6 is expressed in the epithelial cells that
are precursors of the exocrine and endocrine pancreatic cells. Jacquemin
et al. (2000) investigated the role of Hnf6 in pancreas differentiation
by inactivating its gene in the mouse. In hnf6-null embryos, the
exocrine pancreas appeared to be normal but endocrine cell
differentiation was impaired. The expression of neurogenin-3 (NGN3;
604882), a transcription factor that is essential for determination of
endocrine cell precursors, was almost abolished. Consistent with this,
Jacquemin et al. (2000) demonstrated that Hnf6 binds to and stimulates
the ngn3 gene promoter. At birth, only a few endocrine cells were found
and the islets of Langerhans were missing. Later, the number of
endocrine cells increased and islets appeared. However, the architecture
of the islets was perturbed, and the beta cells were deficient in
glucose transporter-2 (SLC2A2; 138160) expression. Adult hnf6-null mice
were diabetic. The authors concluded that Hnf6 controls pancreatic
endocrine differentiation at the precursor stage and stated that their
data identify Hnf6 as the first positive regulator of the proendocrine
gene ngn3 in the pancreas.

During pancreatic organogenesis, endocrine cells arise from
non-self-renewing progenitors that express Ngn3. Maestro et al. (2003)
showed that from E13 to E18 (the embryonic stage during which the major
burst of beta-cell neogenesis takes place) murine pancreatic duct cells
express Hnf1b (189907), the product of the maturity-onset diabetes of
the young type-5 (MODY5; 137920) gene. Ngn3-positive cells at this stage
invariably cluster with mitotically competent Hnf1b-positive cells and
are often intercalated with these cells in the epithelium that lines the
lumen of primitive ducts. Hnf1b expression is markedly reduced in early
pancreatic epithelial cells of Hnf6-deficient mice, in which formation
of Ngn3-positive cells is defective. Maestro et al. (2003) suggested
that Hnf1b plays a role in the genetic hierarchy regulating the
generation of pancreatic endocrine cells.

601265	TITLE *601265 NODAL, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; NODAL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

NODAL is a member of the TGF-beta gene family and is expressed during
mouse gastrulation (Zhou et al., 1993). Nodal has a left-sided
expression pattern that is disrupted in mouse models of LR axis
development (see Lowe et al. (1996)).

Gebbia et al. (1997) stated that they had characterized the human
homolog of mouse Nodal to search for mutations in individuals with LR
axis malformations.

GENE FUNCTION

Collignon et al. (1996) showed that some mice manifest LR axis
malformations when doubly heterozygous for null mutations in Nodal and
in the transcription factor Hnf3b (600288).

Olson and Srivastava (1996) reviewed the role of the morphogen Nodal in
the control of the direction of cardiac looping and in the development
of left to right asymmetry in chick and mouse.

Brennan et al. (2001) demonstrated that signals from the epiblast are
responsible for the initiation of the proximal-distal polarity in the
mouse embryo. Nodal acts to promote posterior cell fates in the epiblast
and to maintain molecular pattern in the adjacent extra-embryonic
ectoderm. Both of these functions are independent of SMAD2 (601366).
Moreover, Nodal signals from the epiblast also pattern the visceral
endoderm by activating the SMAD2-dependent pathway required for
specification of anterior identity in overlying epiblast cells. Brennan
et al. (2001) concluded that proximal-distal and subsequent
anterior-posterior polarity of the pregastrulation embryo result from
reciprocal cell-cell interactions between the epiblast and the 2
extraembryonic tissues.

By analyzing mouse mutants lacking left-sided expression of Lefty2
(601877), Meno et al. (2001) observed that Nodal is able to diffuse over
a large distance in the absence of Lefty2. They concluded that Nodal is
a long-range signaling molecule but that its range of action is normally
limited by the feedback inhibitor Lefty2.

Iratni et al. (2002) demonstrated that the transcriptional corepressor
DRAP1 (602289) has a very specific role in regulation of Nodal activity
during mouse embryogenesis. Iratni et al. (2002) found that loss of
DRAP1 leads to severe gastrulation defects that are consistent with
increased expression of Nodal and can be partially suppressed by Nodal
heterozygosity. Biochemical studies indicated that DRAP1 interacts with
and inhibits DNA binding by the winged-helix transcription factor FOXH1
(FAST1; 603621), a critical component of a positive feedback loop for
Nodal activity. Iratni et al. (2002) proposed that DRAP1 limits the
spread of a morphogenetic signal by downmodulating the response to the
Nodal autoregulatory loop.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mohapatra et al. (2009) noted that the NODAL gene contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

The mouse Nodal gene maps to chromosome 10 (Zhou et al., 1993). The
International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the human NODAL
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP stSG2607).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a family in which several members had situs ambiguus shown to be due
to mutation in the ZIC3 gene (300265), Gebbia et al. (1997) found a
normal male with a daughter with situs ambiguus; neither the father nor
the daughter carried any mutation in the coding region of ZIC3 and both
parents were anatomically normal. Paternity was confirmed, the mother
was unrelated to the rest of the family, and the daughter had a 46,XX
karyotype. Because observations in mice had suggested that heterozygous
mutations in human NODAL may be associated with human situs
abnormalities, Gebbia et al. (1997) searched for mutations in the NODAL
gene. In the affected daughter and her unaffected mother, they found an
arg183-to-gln substitution (R183Q; 601265.0001) in the prodomain of
NODAL. None of more than 200 control chromosomes carried this
substitution, and no other NODAL mutations were identified in other
members of that family or in any other individual harboring a mutant
ZIC3 allele.

In 14 of 269 patients with either classic heterotaxy or looping
cardiovascular malformations (CVM), Mohapatra et al. (2009) identified 4
different missense variants (see, e.g., 601265.0002), 1 in-frame
insertion/deletion (601265.0003), and 2 conserved splice site variants
(see, e.g., 601265.0004) in the NODAL gene. Although similar with regard
to other associated defects, individuals with the NODAL mutations had a
significantly higher occurrence of pulmonary valve atresia (p = 0.001)
compared with individuals without a detectable NODAL mutation.
Functional analysis demonstrated that the missense variant forms of
NODAL exhibited significant impairment of signaling as measured by
decreased Cripto (TDGF1; 187395) coreceptor-mediated activation of
artificial reporters. Expression of these NODAL proteins also led to
reduced induction of SMAD2 phosphorylation and impaired SMAD2 nuclear
import. Mohapatra et al. (2009) proposed a role for mutations and rare
deleterious variants in NODAL as a cause for sporadic human left-right
patterning defects.

ANIMAL MODEL

Krebs et al. (2003) showed that mouse embryos mutant for the Notch
ligand Dll1 (606582) or doubly mutant for Notch1 (190198) and Notch2
(600275) exhibited multiple defects in left-right asymmetry. Dll1 -/-
embryos did not express Nodal in the region around the node. Analysis of
the enhancer regulating node-specific Nodal expression revealed binding
sites for Rbpj (RBPSUH; 147183). Mutation of these sites destroyed the
ability of the enhancer to direct node-specific gene expression in
transgenic mice. Krebs et al. (2003) concluded that Dll1-mediated Notch
signaling is essential for generation of left-right asymmetry, and that
perinodal expression of Nodal is an essential component of left-right
asymmetry determination in mice.

Using gain- and loss-of-function experiments in zebrafish and mouse,
Raya et al. (2003) showed that activity of the Notch pathway was
necessary and sufficient for Nodal expression around the node and for
proper left-right determination. They also identified critical
Rbpj-binding sequences in the Nodal promoter.

Ware et al. (2006) found that mice compound heterozygous for a Zic3 and
a Nodal mutation had significantly increased lethality compared to
Zic3-null mice. No males and a reduced number of females survived.
Accordingly, the laterality defects observed in compound heterozygous
mice were more severe than in mice with either mutant alone. The
findings indicated that the 2 genes interact in the same pathway.
Further studies indicated that Zic3 activates an upstream enhancer of
Nodal.

Yang et al. (2010) reported that holoprosencephaly (see HPE, 236100) in
mice can result from simultaneous reduction in both Nodal (601265)
signaling and expression levels of the Bmp antagonists chordin (CHRD;
603475) or Noggin (NOG; 602991). HPE defects are the result of reduced
production of tissues that promote forebrain and craniofacial
development. Nodal promotes the expression of genes in the anterior
primitive streak important for the development of these tissues, whereas
Bmp inhibits their expression. Pharmacologic and transgenic manipulation
of these signaling pathways suggested that the Bmp and Nodal pathways
antagonize each other prior to intracellular signal transduction. In
vitro experiments indicated that secreted Bmp2 (112261) and Nodal can
form extracellular complexes, potentially interfering with receptor
activation. Yang et al. (2010) concluded that the patterning of
forebrain and medial craniofacial elements requires a fine balance
between BMP and NODAL signaling during primitive streak development.

Reaction-diffusion models postulated that differences in signaling range
are caused by differential diffusivity of inhibitor and activator. Other
models suggested that differential clearance underlies different
signaling ranges. To test these models, Muller et al. (2012) measured
the biophysical properties of the Nodal/Lefty (see 603037)
activator/inhibitor system during zebrafish embryogenesis. Analysis of
Nodal and Lefty gradients revealed that Nodals have a shorter range than
Lefty proteins. Pulse-labeling analysis indicated that Nodals and Leftys
have similar clearance kinetics, whereas fluorescence recovery assays
revealed that Leftys have a higher effective diffusion coefficient than
Nodals. Muller et al. (2012) concluded that their results indicated that
differential diffusivity is the major determinant of the differences in
Nodal/Lefty range and provided biophysical support for
reaction-diffusion models of activator/inhibitor-mediated patterning.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HETEROTAXY, VISCERAL, 5, AUTOSOMAL
NODAL, ARG183GLN

In a kindred in which several members had X-linked abnormalities of
left-right body axis formation (306955) due to mutation in the ZIC3 gene
(300265), Gebbia et al. (1997) found a normal male who had fathered a
daughter with situs ambiguus (270100). Neither she nor the father
carried any mutation in ZIC3, and both parents were anatomically normal.
The daughter and her unaffected mother who was unrelated to the father
were found to be heterozygous for an arg182-to-gln (R183Q) mutation in
the prodomain of the NODAL gene.

.0002
HETEROTAXY, VISCERAL, 5, AUTOSOMAL
NODAL, GLY260ARG

In 8 of 82 unrelated Hispanic patients with heterotaxy (270100),
Mohapatra et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 778G-A transition in
exon 2 of the NODAL gene, resulting in a gly260-to-arg (G260R)
substitution in a highly conserved residue. Most patients had
d-transposition of the great arteries in addition to other cardiac
anomalies, 3 had abdominal situs inversus, and 2 had asplenia. The
detection of this variant in the unaffected father of 1 patient and 1 of
108 Hispanic controls, suggested incomplete penetrance. None of the 190
Caucasian or African American controls examined carried the variant.
Functional analysis showed reduced NODAL signaling through both
FOXH1-dependent and -independent pathways, as well as reduced SMAD2
phosphorylation and impaired nuclear import.

.0003
HETEROTAXY, VISCERAL, 5, AUTOSOMAL
NODAL, 9-BP INS/24-BP DEL, NT700

In a male Hispanic patient with heterotaxy (270100), Mohapatra et al.
(2009) identified an in-frame 9-bp insertion (700insTTGACTTCC) and 24-bp
deletion (nucleotide 700-723) in exon 2 of the NODAL gene. The patient
had d-transposition of the great arteries, pulmonary atresia, and
double-inlet left ventricle. Parental DNA was not available for testing,
and the mutation was not detected in 298 controls. Functional analysis
showed reduced NODAL signaling through both FOXH1-dependent and
-independent pathways, as well as reduced SMAD2 phosphorylation and
impaired nuclear import.

.0004
HETEROTAXY, VISCERAL, 5, AUTOSOMAL
NODAL, IVS2DS, G-A, +1

In a male Hispanic patient with heterotaxy (270100), Mohapatra et al.
(2009) identified a G-to-A transition (891+1G-A) in the donor splice
site of intron 2 of the NODAL gene, predicted to result in altered
splicing activity. The patient had dextrocardia, levo-transposition of
the great arteries, double-outlet right ventricle, pulmonary valve
stenosis, and a ventricular septal defect. The mutation was not detected
in 298 controls.

606028	TITLE *606028 CLEAVAGE AND POLYADENYLATION SPECIFICITY FACTOR 2; CPSF2
;;CLEAVAGE-POLYADENYLATION SPECIFICITY FACTOR, 100-KD SUBUNIT; CPSF100
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) is a multisubunit
complex that plays a central role in 3-prime processing of pre-mRNAs.
CPSF recognizes the AAUAAA signal in the pre-mRNA and interacts with
other proteins to facilitate both RNA cleavage and poly(A) synthesis
(summary by Murthy and Manley, 1995). The CPSF2 gene encodes the 100-kD
subunit of CPSF.

CLONING

Jenny et al. (1994) cloned a cDNA encoding bovine Cpsf2. Northern blot
analysis using bovine Cpsf2 coding sequences revealed expression of
5.6-, 4.6-, 3.8-, and 3.0-kb transcripts in HeLa cells. Immunoblot
analysis showed expression of a 100-kD nuclear protein in bovine and
human cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated expression of
both the 100-kD and the 160-kD (CPSF1; 606027) CPSF subunits in
nucleoplasm but not in nucleoli.

Nagase et al. (2000) cloned a partial cDNA encoding 579 amino acids of
human CPSF2, which they called KIAA1367, from a fetal brain cDNA
library. The partial human protein is 99% identical to the 782-amino
acid bovine protein. RT-PCR analysis revealed ubiquitous but variable
expression of CPSF2, with highest levels in liver and testis.

MAPPING

Samiotaki et al. (2000) mapped the CPSF2 gene to 14q31.3 using radiation
hybrid analysis.

188360	TITLE *188360 THYMOCYTE ANTIGEN CD1B; CD1B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CD1B is a group-1 member of the CD1 family of major histocompatibility
(MHC)-like glycoproteins. See CD1A (188370) for background information
on CD1 molecules.

GENE FUNCTION

Beckman et al. (1994) and Sieling et al. (1995) showed that T cells can
recognize not only peptide antigens presented by classical MHC
molecules, but also virulence-associated mycobacterial lipid antigens
such as mycolic acids and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) derivatives,
respectively, presented to TCRA (see 186880)/TCRB+ (see 186930) CD4-CD8-
T cells by CD1B-bearing antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Sieling et al.
(1995) found that LAM recognition requires internalization and
acidification in the endosomal compartment before presentation on the
APC surface. Examining dermal leprosy (246300) lesions by
immunohistochemistry from patients with the tuberculoid form of the
disease, associated with high specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI),
Sieling et al. (1999) observed strong induction of CD1A, CD1B, and CD1C
(188340) expression. In contrast, lesions from patients with the
lepromatous form, associated with weak or absent M. leprae-specific CMI,
do not express CD1 antigens. Moreover, by 2-color immunofluorescence
analysis, Sieling et al. (1999) demonstrated that the cells expressing
CD1 antigens are CD83+ (604534) dendritic cells, which are also highly
efficient APCs for CD1B-restricted T cells in vitro.

In a review of CD1 lipid antigen presentation, Park and Bendelac (2000)
noted that lipid binding might occur in the secretory pathway, at the
cell surface, or only after internalization in an acidified compartment.
CD1B is located in the late endosome or lysosome. Access to the
endocytic pathway is regulated by a tyrosine-based motif in the
cytoplasmic tail of CD1 that differs among CD1B, CD1C, and CD1D
(188410).

Vincent et al. (2002) showed that group-1 (i.e., CD1A, CD1B, and CD1C)
foreign antigen-nonspecific CD1-restricted T-cell clones could promote
dendritic cell (DC) maturation in the presence of lipopolysaccharide and
gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570), whereas group-2 (i.e., CD1D)-restricted
T cells failed to induce interleukin-12 p70 (IL12; see 161561)
production and DC maturation except in the presence of CD40 ligand
(CD40LG; 300386). On the other hand, the CD1D-restricted T-cell clones
were more efficient producers of IL10 (124092).

Sugita et al. (2002) showed that CD1B, but not other CD1 isoforms, binds
the AP3 adaptor protein complex (see AP3B1; 603401). In AP3-deficient
cells from patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome-2 (HPS2; 608233),
which is caused by mutations in the AP3B1 gene, CD1B fails to gain
access to lysosomes efficiently and is mislocalized to the plasma
membrane and early endosomes. The failure in CD1B trafficking results in
a profound failure to present microbial lipid antigens efficiently.
Since MHC class II traffics normally in AP3-deficient cells, Sugita et
al. (2002) proposed that defects in CD1B antigen presentation may
account for the recurrent bacterial infections in HPS2 patients. They
concluded that there is an AP3-dependent pathway for antigen
presentation by CD1B molecules.

Winau et al. (2004) transfected PSAP (176801)-deficient dermal
fibroblasts and normal fibroblasts with CD1B. PSAP-deficient fibroblasts
were characterized by a loss of spindle shape and accumulation of
intracellular vesicles typical of lysosomal storage disorders.
PSAP-deficient cells could only function as proficient
antigen-presenting cells for Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipid
antigen-specific T cells in the presence of exogenous SAPC and not in
the presence of SAPA, SAPB, or SAPD. Fluorescence microscopy
demonstrated that lipid antigen, SAPC, and CD1B colocalized in lysosomal
compartments of PSAP-deficient CD1B-transfected fibroblasts. SAPC, and
to a far lesser extent SAPA, were able to extract lipid antigen from
membranes. Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analysis showed that SAPC,
but not other SAPs, specifically bound CD1B, but not CD1A, MHC class I,
or MHC class II. Winau et al. (2004) proposed that SAPC exposes lipid
antigens from intralysosomal membranes for loading onto CD1B.

602942	TITLE *602942 ECOTROPIC VIRAL INTEGRATION SITE 5; EVI5
;;NEUROBLASTOMA STAGE 4S GENE; NB4S
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Roberts et al. (1998) cloned the breakpoints of a constitutional
t(1;10)(p22;q21) translocation in a child with stage 4S neuroblastoma
(256700). They identified the gene on chromosome 1 as EVI5, which they
called NB4S, and obtained a full-length NB4S cDNA by database analysis,
screening a liver cDNA library, and 5-prime RACE of adult brain total
RNA. The deduced 810-amino acid protein shares 88% identity with mouse
Evi5. A 200-amino acid region of NB4S shares significant homology with
TBC1 box motif proteins (see 609850) involved in cell growth and
differentiation. The C-terminal end of the protein contains a number of
coiled-coil domains, indicating a possible protein-protein binding
function. Northern blot analysis detected a 7.5-kb transcript in a wide
variety of tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) inhibitor EMI1 (FBXO5;
606013) controls progression to S phase and mitosis by stabilizing key
APC/C ubiquitination substrates, including cyclin A (CCNA2; 123835).
Eldridge et al. (2006) found that endogenous EVI5 and EMI1
coprecipitated from human embryonic kidney cell lysates and that the
recombinant proteins interacted in vitro. Each protein bound the other
through its N terminus. Immunofluorescence microscopy localized EVI5
predominantly to centrosomes in interphase human osteosarcoma cells, and
centrosomal localization required the C-terminal half of EVI5. In
synchronized HeLa cells, EVI5 accumulated in early G1 phase, reached
maximal level by late G1, and decreased in early mitosis concomitantly
with EMI1 in a ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent manner. Degradation
of EVI5 in early mitosis required phosphorylation of EVI5 by PLK1
(602098). In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that EVI5 stabilized
EMI1 during interphase by binding to a site adjacent to the EMI1 degron
and blocking both PLK-dependent degron phosphorylation and subsequent
BTRC (603482) binding. By doing so, EVI5 antagonized ubiquitin-dependent
destruction of EMI1 by the BTRC-containing SCF complex. Ablation of EVI5
by small interfering RNA caused precocious degradation of EMI1,
premature APC/C activation, cyclin destruction, cell cycle arrest,
centrosome overduplication, and mitotic catastrophe. Eldridge et al.
(2006) concluded that EVI5 serves as a critical regulator of cell cycle
progression by defining a window of stability for EMI1 during interphase
analogous to the window of stability provided by EMI1 for APC/C
substrates over a similar period.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Roberts et al. (1998) mapped the EVI5 gene
to chromosome 1p22.

CYTOGENETICS

Roberts et al. (1998) cloned the breakpoints of a constitutional
t(1;10)(p22;q21) translocation in a child with stage 4S neuroblastoma.
The chromosome 1 breakpoint interrupted NB4S, and the chromosome 10
breakpoint interrupted a novel transcript, called TRNG10, that could
only be detected in tumor cells. This transcript has no exon/intron
structure or significant open reading frame, suggesting that it is a
structural RNA that is transcribed but not translated. The chromosome
rearrangement created a fusion gene product that combined the TBC1 motif
of NB4S with a polyadenylation signal from TRNG10, potentially
generating a truncated protein with oncogenic properties.

605759	TITLE *605759 ANKYRIN REPEAT- AND SOCS BOX-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; ASB2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteins of the ASB family, such as ASB2, contain central tandem ankyrin
(see 612641) repeats and a C-terminal suppressor of cytokine signaling
(SOCS) box. SOCS box proteins are predicted to be involved in protein
degradation by acting as a bridge between substrate proteins and E3
ubiquitin protein ligases (see 601623) (review by Kile et al., 2002).

CLONING

By EST database searching, probing a mouse spleen cDNA library, and
further database searching, Kile et al. (2000) identified a cDNA
encoding ASB2. Sequence analysis predicted that the 544-amino acid
protein, which is 94% identical to the mouse protein, contains 15
ankyrin repeats and a C-terminal SOCS box. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues revealed wide expression of a 2.6-kb transcript, with
highest expression in muscle, heart, and spleen.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kile et al. (2000) determined that the ASB2 gene contains at least 10
exons.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the ASB2 gene to chromosome 14q32.12 based on an
alignment of the ASB2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK A056723) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Kile et al. (2000) mapped the mouse gene between the markers D12Mit99
and D12Mit278.

GENE FUNCTION

Kohroki et al. (2005) found that epitope-tagged ASB2 and several other
ASB family members interacted with endogenous CUL5 (601741) and RBX2
(RNF7; 603863) in immunoprecipitated HEK293 cells. The ASB proteins did
not interact with CUL2 (603135) or RBX1 (603814). ASB2-CUL5-RBX2
complexes showed E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro.

605625	TITLE *605625 MYELOMA OVEREXPRESSED GENE; MYEOV
DESCRIPTION Translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IgH; see
147100) at 14q32.3 are mediated by errors during VDJ recombination
either early in development or during class-switch recombination at
later stages in B-cell development. Such translocations occur in as many
as 70% of multiple myelomas and plasma cell leukemias. See 254500.

By cloning gastric carcinoma tumor DNA into phage vectors, probing with
human Alu repetitive sequences, and exon-trap analysis, Janssen et al.
(2000) isolated a cDNA encoding MYEOV (myeloma overexpressed gene).
Sequence analysis predicted that the 313-amino acid protein contains no
known functional motifs except for an RNP1 motif typical of RNA-binding
proteins and a leucine-isoleucine tail similar to cytoplasmically
exposed membrane proteins with a C-terminal membrane anchor. Northern
blot analysis detected a major 2.8-kb and a minor 3.5-kb transcript in
various tumor cell lines. In 3 of 7 multiple myeloma cell lines with a
t(11;14)(q13;q32) and cyclin D1 (CCND1; 168461) overexpression, Northern
blot analysis determined that MYEOV was overexpressed. In all 7 cell
lines, the breakpoint was mapped to the 360-kb region between the 2
genes. MYEOV overexpression was associated with the juxtaposition of an
enhancer to the MYEOV gene.

Using FISH, Janssen et al. (2000) mapped the MYEOV gene to 11q13.1, 360
kb centromeric to CCND1.

DNA amplifications at 11q13 are frequently observed in esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma (133239) and correlate with a malignant
phenotype. Although this amplicon spans a region of several megabases
and harbors numerous genes, CCND1 and EMS1 (164765) are thought to be
the relevant candidates in esophageal carcinoma. Janssen et al. (2002)
investigated whether the putative transforming gene MYEOV, mapping 360
kb centromeric to CCND1 and activated concomitantly with CCND1 in a
subset of t(11;14)(q13;q32) positive multiple myeloma cell lines,
represents a target of 11q13 amplification in esophageal carcinoma. They
tested 31 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and 48 primary
tumors for copy number levels of MYEOV and demonstrated that MYEOV was
always coamplified with CCND1. However, its activation was sometimes
inhibited by an epigenetic mechanism.

611282	TITLE *611282 DYNAMIN-BINDING PROTEIN; DNMBP
;;TUBA;;
KIAA1010
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNMBP belongs to the DBL (311030) family of guanine nucleotide exchange
factors and plays a role in the regulation of cell junctions (Otani et
al., 2006).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned DNMBP, which they designated
KIAA1010. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its 3-prime
UTR, and the deduced protein contains motifs suggesting it is a guanine
nucleotide regulatory protein. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression
in ovary, testis, liver, and lung and low expression in all other
tissues examined. Expression was low in all specific brain regions
examined and moderate in spinal cord.

Using the partial KIAA1010 sequence for 5-prime RACE of muscle and brain
cDNA libraries, Salazar et al. (2003) obtained a full-length cDNA
encoding DNMBP, which they called Tuba, in line with the tradition of
naming large synaptic proteins after musical instruments. The deduced
1,577-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 178 kD. It
has 4 N-terminal SH3 domains, followed by a proline-rich region, a
coiled-coil domain, a DBL homology (DH) domain, a BIN (see 601248)/
amphiphysin (see 600418)/Rvs (BAR) domain, and 2 C-terminal SH3 domains.
Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of 7.3- and 6.0-kb
transcripts in all tissues examined. Mouse tissues expressed an
additional smaller transcript. Immunohistochemical analysis of rat brain
cryosections revealed colocalization of Dnmbp with synaptic markers in
neuronal perikarya and dendrites. In addition, Dnmbp localized with the
Golgi complex in neuronal cell bodies.

GENE FUNCTION

Salazar et al. (2003) found that the isolated N-terminal SH3 domains of
Tuba interacted with dynamin-1 (DNM1; 602377) in rat brain extracts and
Chinese hamster ovary cells. The C-terminal SH3 domain of Tuba bound a
variety of actin regulatory proteins, including N-Wasp (WASL; 605056),
Wire (WIPF2; 609692), Wave1 (WASF1; 605035), and Mena (ENAH; 609061), in
rat brain extracts, and it promoted F-actin (see 102610) recruitment in
a mouse neuronal cell line. The isolated DH domain of Tuba showed
concentration-dependent guanyl nucleotide exchange activity with Cdc42
(116952), but not with Rho (ARHA; 165390) or Rac (602048).

Otani et al. (2006) showed that Tuba concentrated at the apical-most
region of cell junctions in a human colon carcinoma cell line via its
interaction with ZO1 (TJP1; 601009). RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated
depletion of Tuba altered the geometric configuration of cell junctions,
resulting in a curved and slack appearance. At the subcellular level,
Tuba inactivation modified the assembly of junctional F-actin and
E-cadherin (CDH1; 192090). Tuba RNAi also retarded cell junction
formation in calcium-switch experiments. Suppression of CDC42 activity
or depletion of N-WASP, an effector of CDC42, mimicked the effect of
Tuba depletion. Conversely, overexpression of dominant-active CDC42 or
N-WASP enhanced junction formation in Tuba-depleted cells. Otani et al.
(2006) concluded that Tuba controls the shaping of cell junctions
through local activation of CDC42 and its effectors.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the DNMBP gene
to chromosome 10. Salazar et al. (2003) stated that the mouse Dnmbp gene
maps to chromosome 19.

606160	TITLE *606160 PANTOTHENATE KINASE 1; PANK1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pantothenate kinase (EC 2.7.2.33) is an essential regulatory enzyme in
CoA biosynthesis, catalyzing the cytosolic phosphorylation of
pantothenate (vitamin B5), N-pantothenoylcysteine, and pantetheine. CoA
is the major acyl carrier, playing a central role in intermediary and
fatty acid metabolism. In both yeast and fly, each with only 1
pantothenate kinase gene, the null mutant is inviable (summary by Zhou
et al., 2001).

CLONING

Karim et al. (2000) cloned and sequenced 3 human cDNAs that encode the
alpha, beta, and gamma isoforms of PANK1, which have distinct amino
termini and are predicted to arise from alternative splicing of
transcripts of the same gene. The alpha, beta, and gamma proteins
contain 598, 373, and 400 amino acids, respectively, and share a common
C terminus of 40 kD. Northern blot analysis detected expression of PANK1
in all tissues examined, but predominantly in liver and kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

Karim et al. (2000) determined that the PANK1 gene contains 9 exons and
spans about 62 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Karim et al. (2000) mapped the
PANK1 gene to chromosome 10q23.2-q23.31. They mapped the mouse Pank1
gene to a region of syntenic homology on chromosome 19C2-3.

612257	TITLE *612257 MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED SERINE/THREONINE KINASE 2; MAST2
;;MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED SERINE/THREONINE KINASE, 205-KD; MAST205;;
KIAA0807
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned MAST2, which they designated
KIAA0807. The deduced 1,265-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with mouse Mast205. RT-PCR ELISA detected variable MAST2
expression in all tissues examined.

Walden and Cowan (1993) cloned mouse Mast205 from a testis cDNA library.
The deduced 1,734-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
190.5 kD. It had an apparent molecular mass of 205 kD by SDS-PAGE.
Mast205 contains a central serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain,
which includes an ATP-binding consensus sequence, and several potential
phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected
Mast205 expression only in testis. Mast205 expression increased during
postnatal testicular development coincident with meiosis/spermiogenesis.
Immunofluorescence microscopy showed Mast205 associated with mouse
spermatid manchette.

GENE FUNCTION

Walden and Cowan (1993) confirmed that mouse Mast205 had
serine/threonine kinase activity, but not tyrosine kinase activity.
Mouse Mast205 associated with bovine microtubules in vitro. Mutation
analysis revealed that the kinase domain and a more C-terminal domain of
Mast205 were required interaction with microtubules; however, the
interaction was indirect and required other microtubule-associated
proteins.

Valiente et al. (2005) showed that the C-terminal tail of human PTEN
(601728) bound to the PDZ domains of rat Magi2 (606382), Magi3, and Dlg
(DLG1; 601014), mouse Sast (MAST1; 612256) and Mast205, and human MAST3
(612258). Interaction of PTEN with Magi2 increased PTEN protein
stability, and interaction of PTEN with the MAST kinases facilitated
phosphorylation of PTEN by these kinases.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the MAST1 gene
to chromosome 1.

;;LIFEGUARD; LFG;;
NEUROMEMBRANE PROTEIN 35; NMP35
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is used in a number of biologic
processes from modeling the embryo and regulating the immune system to
tumor regression. Conversely, dysfunction of this system has been
implicated in oncogenesis, development of autoimmunity, and degenerative
diseases. Intense study of this process identified membrane-bound
receptors and their cognate ligands that together begin the program that
ultimately leads to cell death. The FAS receptor, also called CD95 or
Apo1, is one such receptor, of which the gene is designated TNFRSF6
(134637) to indicate that it is a member of the tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) receptor superfamily. The apoptotic signal must itself be tightly
controlled to avoid inappropriate cell death. Somia et al. (1999)
established a genetic screen to search for molecules that inhibit the
apoptotic signal from the FAS receptor. They isolated a gene, called LFG
('lifeguard'), and found that it is the human homolog of a rat protein,
neuromembrane protein-35 (NMP35), described by Schweitzer et al. (1998).
The LFG open reading frame encodes a 316-amino acid protein predicted by
hydropathy plots to contain 7 membrane-spanning domains. They found that
LFG protects cells uniquely from FAS but not from the mechanistically
related tumor necrosis factor-alpha (191160) death signal. LFG is widely
distributed, but remarkably is highly expressed in the hippocampus. LFG
can bind to the FAS receptor, but does not regulate FAS expression or
interfere with binding of an agonist antibody. Furthermore, LFG does not
inhibit binding of FADD (602457) to FAS.

MAPPING

Somia et al. (1999) used a human/rodent somatic hybrid panel to map the
LFG gene to chromosome 12. This localization was confirmed by
fluorescence in situ hybridization, with a subchromosomal location of
12q13.

179514	TITLE *179514 RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB5B; RAB5B
DESCRIPTION A number of processes in eukaryotic cells are believed to be regulated
by small, monomeric GTPases belonging to the RAS superfamily. A subset
of these GTPases (the yeast YPTI/SEC4 gene products and their mammalian
counterparts, the RAB proteins) plays a central role in membrane
trafficking. Each of the several proteins of this subfamily that have
been identified is thought to regulate vesicular trafficking at a
specific subcellular compartment. The subcellular location of several
RAB proteins has been determined by immunohistochemical methods. For
example, RAB2 (179509) is found in the intermediate recycling pathway
between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex. RAB6 (179513)
is distributed in the medial and trans Golgi. RAB4 (179511) and RAB5A
(179512) are associated with the plasma membrane and early endosomes.
Wilson and Wilson (1992) cloned cDNA of a novel member of the RAB family
by screening a human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA library with
oligonucleotide probes corresponding to a region conserved in all RAB
proteins. The newly identified RAB protein was 81% identical to human
RAB5, the canine counterpart of which had been localized to the plasma
membrane and early endosomes. In light of this homology, Wilson and
Wilson (1992) called the new member of the GTPase superfamily RAB5B. It
is presumably involved in vesicular trafficking at the plasma membrane.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Korenberg et al. (1995) mapped
the RAB5B gene to 12q13.

;;REQUIEM, APOPTOSIS RESPONSE ZINC FINGER GENE; REQ;;
UBI-D4/REQUIEM HOMOLOG; UBID4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chestkov et al. (1996) described a conserved human gene homologous to
Neuro-d4 (DPF1; 601670) that they designated Ubi-d4. The human protein
is the apparent homolog of the mouse Ubi-d4 protein, also known as
Requiem (Gabig et al., 1994).

Apoptosis in murine myeloid cell lines requires expression of the
Requiem gene, which encodes a putative zinc finger protein. A large
consortium (Gabig et al., 1998) consisting of 3 groups detected the
protein in both cytoplasmic and nuclear subcellular fractions of murine
myeloid cells and human K562 leukemia cells, suggesting that the protein
may have a function distinct from that of a transcription factor. The
distribution did not alter upon apoptosis induction by IL3 deprivation.
The gene was expressed in various tissues in early gestational ages;
however, expression was confined to testis, spleen, thymus, and part of
the hippocampus in the adult mouse. The expression profile was
considered consistent with a functional role during rapid growth and
cell turnover, and again suggested a regulatory function for
hematopoietic cells. The nucleotide sequence of the human cDNA is 73%
identical overall to that of the murine cDNA. The human sequence encodes
a 391-amino acid protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Expression of Ubi-d4/requiem appeared to be required for apoptosis
(Chestkov et al., 1996; Gabig et al., 1994).

MAPPING

Chestkov et al. (1996) mapped the DPF2 gene to chromosome 11q13 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

By cohybridization fluorescence in situ hybridization on extended DNA
fibers, Gabig et al. (1998) mapped the REQ gene between MLK3 (600050)
and FAU (134690), which had been mapped to 11q13, telomeric to PYGM
(608455). The physical distance between MLK3 and REQ was estimated to be
150 kb.

610366	TITLE *610366 ADAPTOR-RELATED PROTEIN COMPLEX 3, MU-1 SUBUNIT; AP3M1
;;CLATHRIN ADAPTOR COMPLEX AP3, MU-3A SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AP3M1 is a subunit of the AP3 complex that functions in cargo-selective
transport of proteins from the Golgi to the lysosome. Other subunits of
this complex are beta-3 (see AP3B1; 603401), AP3D1 (607246), and sigma-3
(see AP3S1; 601507) (Odorizzi et al., 1998).

CLONING

Pevsner et al. (1994) cloned rat Ap3m1, which encodes a 47-kD protein
with about 80% amino acid identity to Ap3m2 (610469) and about 30% amino
acid identity to mouse mu-1 (see AP1M1; 603535) and rat mu-2 (AP2M1;
601024). Ap3m1 was expressed in all rat tissues examined, including
brain heart, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, and spinal cord.

GENE FUNCTION

Dell'Angelica et al. (1999) found that the mu-3A subunit of AP3
interacts with tyrosine-based lysosome targeting signals in cargo
proteins and thereby assists in their targeting from the Golgi to
lysosomes.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the AP3M1
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP WI-11846).

609931	TITLE *609931 MYOSIN LIGHT CHAIN 6, ALKALI, SMOOTH MUSCLE AND NONMUSCLE; MYL6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Myosin is composed of heavy chain (MHC; see 160730) and light chain
(MLC) subunits. Alkaline MLCs, such as MYL6, dissociate from MHCs at
high pH. MYL6 encodes both smooth muscle and nonmuscle MLC isoforms
(Hailstones and Gunning, 1990).

CLONING

By screening a genomic library with a chicken Mlc and a partial clone of
MYL1 (160780), followed by screening lymphoblast and smooth muscle cDNA
libraries, Lenz et al. (1989) cloned 2 MYL6 variants generated by
alternative splicing of exon 6. They designated the nonmuscle variant
LYM4 and the smooth muscle variant GT6. Both deduced proteins contain
151 amino acids and differ at only 5 C-terminal amino acids. The GT6
transcript also has a longer 3-prime UTR. Northern blot analysis
detected a 0.7-kb LYM4 transcript in both HeLa cells and human uterus
smooth muscle, whereas a GT6 transcript of similar size was detected in
uterus smooth muscle only.

By screening a transformed human fibroblast cDNA library with MLC1SA
(609930), followed by RT-PCR of human colon RNA, Hailstones and Gunning
(1990) cloned the nonmuscle and smooth muscle variants of MYL6, which
they designated MLC3NM and MLC3SM, respectively. Both deduced proteins
contain 151 amino acids and differ from other MLCs in that they lack
highly basic amino aids in their N termini. MLC3NM has a calculated
molecular mass of 16.9 kD, whereas MLC3SM has a calculated molecular
mass of 17 kD. Expression of MYL6 was highest in fibroblasts and
myoblasts, lower in fetal muscle, and lowest in adult muscle.

Using glutathione S-transferase-3 (GSTP1; 134660) as probe of a retina
cDNA library, Bora et al. (1994) cloned an MYL6 splice variant that they
designated ESMLC. The deduced 157-amino acid ESMLC protein is identical
to GT6 (Lenz et al., 1989) except that it contains additional N-terminal
amino acids. The nucleotide sequence of GSTP1 and ESMLC are 54%
identical, but the deduced proteins are only 11% identical. PCR analysis
detected ESMLC expression in eye, aorta, and heart.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lenz et al. (1989) determined that the MYL6 gene contains 7 exons. Exon
1 encodes only the first methionine and the 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MYL6
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP WI-18807).

611806	TITLE *611806 ARSENIC (+3 OXIDATION STATE) METHYLTRANSFERASE; AS3MT
;;S-ADENOSYL-L-METHIONINE:ARSENIC(III) METHYLTRANSFERASE;;
CYT19
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AS3MT catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from
S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to trivalent arsenical and may play a
role in arsenic metabolism (Lin et al., 2002).

CLONING

By mass spectrometry of rat As3mt purified from rat liver cytosol,
followed by database analysis, Lin et al. (2002) identified human AS3MT.
By PCR of an adult rat liver cDNA library, they cloned rat As3mt. The
deduced 369-amino acid rat protein has a calculated molecular mass of
about 41 kD and contains 2 methyltransferase motifs. RT-PCR analysis of
adult rat tissues detected expression in heart, adrenal, urinary
bladder, brain, kidney, lung, and liver. Human AS3MT was expressed in a
hepatoma cell line but not in an immortalized human urothelial cell
line. Recombinant rat As3mt catalyzed the transfer of methyl groups from
AdoMet to trivalent arsenicals, resulting in methylated and dimethylated
arsenicals.

By 5-prime and 3-prime RACE PCR of a human liver cDNA library, Wood et
al. (2006) cloned AS3MT, which encodes a 375-amino acid protein with 76%
amino acid identity to rat As3mt.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wood et al. (2006) determined that the AS3MT gene contains 11 exons and
spans 32 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wood et al. (2006) mapped the AS3MT gene
to chromosome 10q24.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By sequencing the AS3MT gene in 60 African American and 60 Caucasian
American samples, Wood et al. (2006) identified 26 SNPs, including 3
nonsynonymous SNPs and a VNTR in the 5-prime untranslated region. In
transfected COS-1 cells, a met287-to-thr (M287T)-containing allozyme
showed increased enzyme activity compared to wildtype.

Among 207 Chilean men working in the copper industry and exposed to
arsenic, Hernandez et al. (2008) observed an associated between urinary
arsenic metabolite levels and the M287T SNP in the AS3MT gene, The
thr287 variant occurred at a frequency of 0.09. Individuals carrying the
variant allele presented a 4.63% higher level of arsenic metabolites in
urine than carriers of the wildtype allele (p = 0.0007). When the
population was divided into 2 groups according to the level of arsenic
exposure, a significant increase was found only in the higher exposed
group, where individuals carrying the variant allele presented a 4.79%
higher level of urinary MMA compared to wildtype allele carriers (p =
0.0010). Hernandez et al. (2008) concluded that individuals with the
thr287 variant have increased arsenic methylation and thus may be at an
increased risk for the toxic and genotoxic effects of arsenic exposure,
if, as the classical arsenic metabolic pathway indicates, methylation
enhances toxicity.

114110	TITLE *114110 S100 CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN A6; S100A6
;;CALCYCLIN; CACY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

S100 proteins, such as S100A6, are small, acidic Ca(2+)-binding proteins
that transduce Ca(2+)-signals via interaction with intracellular target
proteins (Mandinova et al., 1998).

CLONING

Ferrari et al. (1987) noted that S100A6, which they called calcyclin,
was originally defined as a cDNA clone (2A9) whose cognate RNA was found
to be growth-regulated and whose sequence showed strong similarities to
that of the S100 protein (see S100A1; 176940) and to a subunit of the
major cellular substrate for tyrosine kinase.

Using Northern blot analysis, Engelkamp et al. (1992) found ubiquitous
expression of a CACY transcript of about 550 bp. Highest expression was
detected in kidney, lung, and thymus.

Using immunofluorescence analysis and confocal laser scanning
microscopy, Mandinova et al. (1998) showed that S100A1, S100A2 (176993),
S100A4 (114210), and S100A6 localized to distinct intracellular
compartments in cultured human vascular and intestinal smooth muscle
cells. S100A6 localized predominantly with the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

GENE FUNCTION

Mandinova et al. (1998) showed that elevated cytosolic Ca(2+) led to
relocalization of S100A1, S100A4, and S100A6 from sarcoplasmic reticulum
to vesicle-like structures around the nucleus in human vascular smooth
muscle cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using a full-length cDNA, Ferrari et al. (1987) isolated the entire
calcyclin gene plus extensive flanking sequences. They found that the
calcyclin gene is present in single copy and has 3 exons. The 5-prime
flanking sequence contains a TATA box, GC boxes, and a sequence with a
strong homology to the enhancer core of the SV40 promoter. Other
enhancer-like elements are scattered in both the 5-prime and 3-prime
flanking regions.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Ferrari et al. (1987) determined that the CACY
gene maps to chromosome 1q21-q25. Using cDNA probes for CACY, van
Heyningen et al. (1989) and Dorin et al. (1990) showed that the CACY
gene cosegregates with CAGA (S100A8; 123885) and CAGB (S100A9; 123886),
which are located on chromosome 1q12-q21. In the course of constructing
a physical map of human 1q21-q23, Oakey et al. (1992) determined that
the CACY gene is located at the centromeric end of that segment,
proximal to SPTA1 (182860).

Schafer et al. (1995) isolated a YAC from chromosome 1q21 on which 9
different genes coding for S100 calcium-binding proteins could be
localized. The clustered organization of S100 genes allowed introduction
of a new logical nomenclature based on their physical arrangement on the
chromosome with S100A1 being closest to the telomere and S100A9 being
closest to the centromere. In the new nomenclature, CACY became S100A6.

By linkage studies of interspecific backcrosses of Mus spretus and Mus
musculus domesticus, Seldin (1989) demonstrated that the Cacy gene is
located on mouse chromosome 3.

171490	TITLE *171490 PHOSDUCIN; PDC
DESCRIPTION Pinealocytes of the pineal gland and photoreceptors of the retina are
embryologically related. In lower vertebrates, the pinealocytes possess
the structure and light sensitivity of retinal photoreceptors; however,
in mammalian pineals, pinealocytes have become shielded from light by
the cranium and have developed an alternative neuroendocrine function
(Reiter, 1981). Rat pinealocytes, like those of other mammals, exhibit
circadian rhythms of activity that are entrained by light through a
circuitous neural pathway, extending from the retina to the hypothalamus
and returning to the pineal via sympathetic nerves of the peripheral
nervous system. The pineal gland contains a soluble phosphoprotein,
phosducin, which is homologous in solubility and primary amino acid
structure to retinal phosducin. Phosducin has been shown to bind the
beta and gamma subunits of the retinal G-protein transducin. Lee et al.
(1990) sequenced the bovine retinal phosducin. Craft et al. (1991) used
the bovine retinal phosducin mRNA to isolate cDNA for this gene from a
rat pineal library. The cDNA was used to map the phosducin gene in the
mouse. By the study of interspecific crosses, Craft et al. (1991) found
that the phosducin gene is located within a region of mouse chromosome 1
that shows homology of synteny with a region of human 1q. Ding et al.
(1993) proved the prediction by homology by mapping the human PDC gene
to chromosome 1 by somatic cell hybridization and by regionalizing the
assignment to 1q25-q31.1 by in situ hybridization. Using both
human/mouse somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization to metaphase
chromosomes, Sparkes et al. (1993) mapped the human PDC gene to
chromosome 1q25-q32.1. PDC is a potential candidate gene for retinitis
pigmentosa. Abe et al. (1994) showed that the PDC gene is 18 kb long and
has 4 exons. The sequences of the human and mouse phosducin genes were
highly homologous.

CHROMOSOME 14 OPEN READING FRAME 137; C14ORF137
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Otubains are deubiquitylating cysteine proteases (DUBs; see 602519) that
belong to the ovarian tumor (OTU) protein superfamily. Like other DUBs,
otubains cleave proteins precisely at the ubiquitin (UB; see
191339)-protein bond.

CLONING

By affinity purification of DUBs from HeLa cells using UB aldehyde
(UBAL), followed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrophotometric analysis,
Balakirev et al. (2003) obtained cDNAs encoding OTB1 (608337) and OTB2.
The 234-amino acid, 27-kD OTB1 protein contains UB-interaction motifs
(UIMs) and UB-associated (UBA) domains, as well as putative nuclear
localization signals and a consensus LxxLL motif. RT-PCR and Western
blot analyses revealed wide expression of OTB2, with highest expression
in brain.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Balakirev et al. (2003) mapped the OTUB2
gene to chromosome 14q32.12.

611202	TITLE *611202 N-ACYLSPHINGOSINE AMIDOHYDROLASE 2; ASAH2
;;CERAMIDASE, NONLYSOSOMAL;;
NONLYSOSOMAL CERAMIDASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ceramidases (EC 3.5.1.23), such as ASAH2, catalyze hydrolysis of the
N-acyl linkage of ceramide, a second messenger in a variety of cellular
events, to produce sphingosine. Sphingosine exerts both mitogenic and
apoptosis-inducing activities, and its phosphorylated form functions as
an intra- and intercellular second messenger (see 603730) (Mitsutake et
al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to rat brain ceramidase,
followed by PCR and RACE of a kidney cDNA library, El Bawab et al.
(2000) cloned ASAH2, which they called CDase. The deduced 761-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 84 kD. It contains a signal
peptide, a mitochondrial targeting sequence, 4 transmembrane domains, a
myristoylation site, phosphorylation sites, and N-glycosylation sites.
Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of a major 3.5-kb
transcript, with highest levels in kidney, skeletal muscle, and heart.
Minor transcripts of 2.4, 3.1, and 7 kb were expressed in some tissues.
Fluorescence-tagged ASAH2 colocalized with a mitochondrial marker in
transfected human cell lines. Western blot analysis detected
fluorescence-tagged ASAH2 at 123 kD, suggesting that the mass of ASAH2
alone is 96 kD.

Avramopoulos et al. (2007) identified ASAH2L (ASAH2C; 610987), a partial
duplication of the ASAH2 gene inserted downstream from promoter
sequences on chromosome 10. Northern blot analysis using probes common
to both ASAH2 and ASAH2L and specific to ASAH2 suggested that ASAH2 was
expressed in colon only. The major ASAH2 transcript was 5.3 kb, and
minor transcripts of 1.5 and 2.5 kb were also detected. RT-PCR showed
highest ASAH2 expression in colon and small intestine, with weaker
expression in kidney and testis. Avramopoulos et al. (2007) concluded
that the ubiquitously expressed 3.5-kb transcript reported by El Bawab
et al. (2000) corresponded to ASAH2L, not ASAH2.

Mitsutake et al. (2001) cloned rat Asah2, which encodes a protein 76%
identical to human ASAH2. They noted that mouse and rat Asah2 lack the
mitochondrial localization signal found in human ASAH2, but they have an
endoplasmic reticulum transitional signal and a lysosome/late endosome
sorting signal not found in the human protein. The rat protein localized
at apical membranes of rat kidney tubules and was enriched in raft
microdomains with cholesterol and GM1 ganglioside. In rat liver, Asah2
distributed with endosome-like organelles in hepatocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

El Bawab et al. (2000) found that ASAH2 catalyzed hydrolysis of ceramide
with a pH optimum between pH 7.5 and 9.5 in transfected human embryonic
kidney cells. ASAH2 activity was independent of EDTA, Mg(2+), and
Ca(2+), but it was inhibited by the reducing agent dithiolthreitol.

GENE STRUCTURE

Avramopoulos et al. (2007) determined that the ASAH2 gene contains 20
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Avramopoulos et al. (2007) mapped the
ASAH2 gene to chromosome 10q11.23.

605210	TITLE *605210 DISRUPTED IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 1; DISC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DISC1 regulates multiple aspects of embryonic and adult neurogenesis
(Kim et al., 2009).

CLONING

Millar et al. (2000) isolated and sequenced a translocation breakpoint
region on chromosome 1q42 that had been identified by St. Clair et al.
(1990) in a large Scottish family with mental and/or behavioral
disorders, including schizophrenia (see 604906), schizoaffective
disorder, recurrent major depression, and adolescent conduct and
emotional disorders. Within the 1q42 chromosomal region, Millar et al.
(2000) identified 2 novel genes directly disrupted by the translocation,
which the authors termed 'disrupted in schizophrenia' 1 and 2 (DISC1 and
DISC2, 606271). The major DISC1 gene is predicted to encode an 854-amino
acid protein containing a globular N-terminal domain and a helical
C-terminal domain with the potential to form a coiled-coil by
interaction with another protein(s). Northern blot analysis identified a
7.5-kb mRNA transcript with ubiquitous expression. DISC2 apparently
specifies a single exon thought to be a noncoding RNA molecule that is
antisense to DISC1, an arrangement that has been observed at other loci
where the antisense RNA may regulate expression of the sense gene.
Millar et al. (2000) suggested that DISC1 and DISC2 may confer
susceptibility to psychiatric illnesses.

Ma et al. (2002) cloned and characterized mouse Disc1, which encodes an
851-amino acid protein that shares 56% sequence identity with the human
protein. Both the mouse and human genes show conservation of leucine
zipper and coiled-coil domains. In situ hybridization in adult mouse
brain showed a restricted expression pattern, with highest levels in the
dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and lower expression in CA1-CA3 of the
hippocampus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and olfactory bulbs. Ozeki et
al. (2003) cloned and characterized mouse and rat Disc1.

Using Western blot analysis of human brain tissue and cultured human
cell lines, Sawamura et al. (2005) found that the DISC1 protein was
expressed as 2 distinct bands of 95 to 100 kD and 75 to 85 kD.
Subcellular fractionation showed that the 95- to 100-kD isoform was
enriched in the cytoplasm, whereas the 75- to 85-kD isoform was present
in both the nucleus and cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Ozeki et al. (2003) demonstrated that rodent Disc1 expression displayed
pronounced developmental regulation, with the highest levels in late
embryonic life during development of the cerebral cortex. In a yeast
2-hybrid assay of a human whole brain cDNA library, DISC1 interacted
with a variety of cytoskeletal proteins. One of these, NUDEL (NDEL1;
607538), is associated with cortical development and is linked to LIS1
(601545). A schizophrenia-associated DISC1 mutant with a C-terminal
257-residue truncation did not bind NUDEL. Expression of mutant DISC1,
but not wildtype DISC1, reduced neurite extension in rat adrenal
pheochromocytoma cells.

Using yeast 2-hybrid, mammalian 2-hybrid, and coimmunoprecipitation
assays, Morris et al. (2003) showed that DISC1 interacts with multiple
proteins of the centrosome and cytoskeletal system, including MIPT3
(607380), MAP1A (600178), and NUDEL; proteins that localize receptors to
membranes, including alpha-actinin-2 (ACTN2; 102573) and beta-4-spectrin
(SPTBN4; 606214); and proteins that transduce signals from membrane
receptors, including ATF4 (604064) and ATF5 (606398). Truncated mutant
DISC1 failed to interact with ATF4, ATF5, or NUDEL. Deletion mapping
demonstrated that DISC1 has distinct interaction domains: MAP1A
interacts via its LC2 domain with the N terminus of DISC1, whereas MIPT3
and NUDEL bind via their C-terminal domains to the central coiled-coil
domain of DISC1, and ATF4/5 bind via their C-terminal domains to the C
terminus of DISC1. In its full-length form, the DISC1 protein localized
to predominantly perinuclear punctate structures which extended into
neurites in some cells; mutant truncated DISC1, by contrast, was seen in
a diffuse pattern throughout the cytoplasm and abundantly in neurites.
Both forms colocalized with the centrosomal complex, although truncated
less abundantly than full-length DISC1. Although both full-length and
mutant DISC1 were found in microtubule fractions, neither form appeared
to bind directly to microtubules, but rather did so in a MIPT3-dependent
fashion that was stabilized by taxol. Morris et al. (2003) concluded
that DISC1 is a multifunctional protein whose truncation may contribute
to schizophrenia susceptibility by disrupting intracellular transport,
neurite architecture, and/or neuronal migration.

Millar et al. (2005) showed that DISC1 interacts with the UCR2 domain of
phosphodiesterase-4B (PDE4B; 600127), implicated in susceptibility to
schizophrenia, and that elevation of cellular cAMP leads to dissociation
of PDE4B from DISC1 and in increase in PDE4B activity. The
phosphodiesterases inactivate cAMP, a second messenger implicated in
learning, memory, and mood. Millar et al. (2005) proposed a mechanistic
model whereby DISC1 sequesters PDE4B in resting cells and releases it in
an activated state in response to elevated cAMP.

Kamiya et al. (2005) identified Disc1 as a component of the
microtubule-associated dynein motor complex in rat PC12 neural precursor
cells. Disc1 was essential for maintaining the motor complex at the
centrosome. A schizophrenia-associated C-terminally truncated Disc1
mutant functioned in a dominant-negative manner by interacting with and
redistributing wildtype Disc1 and by disassociating the Disc1-dynein
complex from the centrosome. Depletion of endogenous Disc1 by RNA
interference or expression of truncated Disc1 impaired neurite outgrowth
in PC12 cells in vitro. In embryonic mice, Disc1 RNA interference led to
impaired cerebral cortex development. Kamiya et al. (2005) concluded
that loss of normal DISC1 function during cerebral cortex development
may underlie neurodevelopmental dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Sawamura et al. (2005) analyzed the 75- to 85-kD isoform of DISC1 in
postmortem orbitofrontal cortex from 3 groups of 15 individuals with
schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder, respectively, and
15 controls. There was an increased P:S ratio (nuclear
pellet:postnuclear supernatant) in schizophrenia and major depression
compared to controls; the increase in bipolar disorder did not reach
statistical significance. The P:S ratio changes in major depression were
significantly influenced by substance/alcohol abuse and by postmortem
interval. The alteration in schizophrenic brains was not associated with
confounding factors, although an interaction with substance/alcohol
abuse could not be ruled out.

Burdick et al. (2008) noted that NDE1 (609449) is a homolog of NDEL1 and
also binds to DISC1. NDE1 was expressed at constant levels in the rat
cerebral cortex from embryonic day (E) 14 to adulthood, whereas NDEL1
expression showed a time-course increase peaking at postnatal day 7.
Further studies with a ser704-to-cys (S704C) polymorphism in the DISC1
gene showed that NDE1 bound stronger to ser704, while NDEL1 bound
stronger to cys704. The findings suggested an interaction of these 3
proteins, with possible competitive binding between NDEL1 and NDE1 for
DISC1.

Using knockdown studies, Mao et al. (2009) found that Disc1 was required
for neural progenitor cell proliferation in vitro, during embryonic
mouse brain development, and in adult mouse dentate gyrus. Disc1
interacted directly with Gsk3-beta (GSK3B; 605004) and inhibited
recombinant Gsk3-beta activity in a dose-dependent manner. This
inhibition of Gsk3-beta caused reduced phosphorylation and increased
stabilization of beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806). Knockdown of Disc1 in
adult mouse dentate gyrus resulted in hyperactivity and depression-like
behaviors. All effects of Disc1 knockdown were reversed by pharmacologic
inhibition of Gsk3-beta. Mao et al. (2009) concluded that DISC1
regulates neural progenitor proliferation by modulating GSK3-beta
activity and beta-catenin abundance.

By immunoprecipitation analysis of cotransfected HEK293 cells, Enomoto
et al. (2009) found that mouse Disc1 interacted with girdin (CCDC88A;
609736), a protein required for proper migration and positioning of
mouse dentate gyrus cells. Domain mapping revealed that the N-terminal
globular domain of Disc1 interacted with the N-terminal domain of
girdin. Girdin colocalized with Disc1 in cultured rat hippocampal
neurons, and knockdown of Disc1 via small interfering RNA impaired
girdin localization at growth cones.

Kim et al. (2009) found that adenovirus-mediated delivery of Kiaa1212
(CCDC88A) or a short hairpin RNA targeting Disc1 in adult mouse newborn
neurons caused elevated Akt (AKT1; 164730) signaling and resulted in a
migratory and positioning defect in the manipulated neurons. Disc1
knockdown or Kiaa1212 overexpression also caused an increase in neuronal
soma size and accelerated primary dendrite branching. Disc1 and Kiaa1212
coimmunoprecipitated from cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, dissected
adult mouse hippocampus, and transfected HEK293 cells. Direct
interaction of Disc1 with Kiaa1212 prevented Kiaa1212-dependent
activation of Akt signaling, and knockdown of Kiaa1212 abrogated
Disc1-dependent downregulation of Akt signaling. Pharmacologic blockage
of Mtor (FRAP1; 601231) also abrogated the effects of Disc1 knockdown or
Kiaa1212 overexpression, suggesting that Mtor is a major downstream
mediator of this signaling pathway.

Ishizuka et al. (2011) reported that phosphorylation of DISC1 acts as a
molecular switch from maintaining proliferation of mitotic progenitor
cells to activating migration of postmitotic neurons in mice.
Unphosphorylated DISC1 regulates canonical Wnt signaling via an
interaction with GSK3-beta, whereas specific phosphorylation at
serine-710 triggers the recruitment of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (see
209900) proteins to the centrosome. In support of this model, loss of
BBS1 (209901) leads to defects in migration, but not proliferation,
whereas DISC1 knockdown leads to deficits in both. A phospho-dead mutant
can only rescue proliferation, whereas a phospho-mimic mutant rescues
exclusively migration defects. Ishizuka et al. (2011) concluded that
their data highlight a dual role for DISC1 in corticogenesis and
indicate that phosphorylation of this protein at serine-710 activates a
key developmental switch.

By Western blot analysis of 60 fractionated postmortem brain samples
divided approximately evenly between individuals diagnosed with chronic
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or depression, and normal controls,
Leliveld et al. (2008) found that DISC1 partitioned in the insoluble
pellet in a subset of cases with psychiatric disease. In transfected
human neuroblastoma cells, when DISC1 was expressed at low levels, it
interacted with endogenous NDEL1; in contrast, when DISC1 was expressed
at high levels, it became insoluble and did not interact with NDEL1.

Using transfected COS-7 cells and cultured rat neurons, Atkin et al.
(2012) found that overexpressed human DISC1 accumulated in perinuclear
aggregates. Insoluble DISC1 recruited endogenous DISC1 away from the
mobile pool of DISC1 puncta and disrupted mitochondrial movement.
Treatment of cultured rat neurons with hydrogen peroxide shifted the
distribution of endogenous Disc1 to an insoluble fraction. Inhibition of
the proteasome or lysosome acidification increased the number of
DISC1-containing aggregates, suggesting that overexpressed DISC1 was
recruited to the aggresome-autophagy pathway for protein removal. Atkin
et al. (2012) concluded that insoluble DISC1 associates with aggresomes
and negatively impacts neuronal function.

Eastwood et al. (2010) found that the DISC1 binding partner PCM1
(600299) was localized to the centrosome in glia of human superior
temporal gyrus, but not in neurons, which showed widespread
immunoreactivity. The authors quantified centrosomal PCM1
immunoreactivity in superior temporal gyrus glia of 81 controls and 67
subjects with schizophrenia, and genotyped the subjects for the 2 DISC1
polymorphisms leu607 to phe (dbSNP rs6675281) and ser704 to cys (dbSNP
rs821616). Centrosomal PCM1 immunoreactive area was smaller in cys704
carriers than in ser704 homozygotes, with a similar trend in phe607
homozygotes compared with leu607 carriers. No differences were seen
between controls and subjects with schizophrenia. The authors concluded
that DISC1 coding variants modulate centrosomal PCM1 localization, and
proposed a role for DISC1 in glial function that may be altered in
psychiatric disorders.

MAPPING

Ma et al. (2002) determined that the mouse Disc1 gene maps to chromosome
8 in a region with homology of synteny to human chromosome 1q42. Ma et
al. (2002) demonstrated that translin-associated factor X (TSNAX;
602964), which is situated 35 kb proximal to the DISC1 sequence on human
chromosome 1, is located approximately 20 kb proximal to Disc1 in the
mouse at 69.5 cM.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The family studied by St. Clair et al. (1990) and Millar et al. (2000)
was originally ascertained by Jacobs et al. (1970), who reported the
translocation in the propositus, who had adolescent conduct disorder,
and in members of 4 generations of the extended family. Blackwood et al.
(2001) provided a follow-up. Of the 87 members of the family who were
karyotyped, 37 carried the (1;11)(q42;q14.3) translocation. A
psychiatric diagnosis was reached in 29 carriers, 38 noncarriers, and
the 2 founders (who were not karyotyped). The range of symptoms in this
family crossed traditional diagnostic boundaries, and the locus
identified by the breakpoint on 1q42 appeared to be implicated in either
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (125480). Furthermore, Blackwood
(2000) reported abnormalities in the auditory P300 event-related
potential, which showed prolonged latency and reduced amplitude in
affected members of the family.

Ekelund et al. (2001) used a large, population-based study sample (221
Finnish families, 557 affected individuals) to refine the localization
of schizophrenia loci on chromosome 1q. The results were analyzed
separately for families originating from an internal isolate of Finland
and for families from the rest of Finland, as well as for all families
jointly. Evidence for linkage was obtained for 1 locus in the combined
sample (maximum lod = 2.71, D1S2709) and in the nuclear families from
outside the internal isolate (maximum lod = 3.21, D1S2709). In the
families from the internal isolate the strongest evidence for linkage
was obtained with markers located 22 cM centromeric from this marker
(maximum lod = 2.30, D1S245). The strongest evidence for linkage in the
combined study sample was obtained for marker D1S2709, which is a marker
within DISC1. In a follow-up study to Ekelund et al. (2001), Ekelund et
al. (2004) genotyped 300 polymorphic markers on chromosome 1 using a
sample of 70 Finnish families with multiple individuals affected with
schizophrenia or related conditions. They again found linkage on
chromosome 1q42 maximizing within the DISC1 gene (dbSNP rs1000731, lod
of 2.70).

By analysis of SNPs and corresponding haplotypes across candidate genes
in the 1q42 region identified by Ekelund et al. (2001) as being linked
to schizophrenia in a Finnish sample, Hennah et al. (2003) identified a
significant region of interest within the DISC1 gene. They identified a
2-SNP haplotype spanning from intron 1 to exon 2 of the DISC1 gene,
designated HEP3 (605210.0001), and demonstrated that it was
undertransmitted to affected women in the general Finnish population.
The HEP3 haplotype also displayed sex differences in transmission
distortion, the undertransmission being significant only in affected
females. Hodgkinson et al. (2004) presented data from a case-control
study of a North American white population, confirming the
underrepresentation of the HEP3 haplotype in individuals with
schizoaffective disorder. Multiple haplotypes contained within 4
haplotype blocks extending between exon 1 and exon 9 were associated
with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder.
Hodgkinson et al. (2004) also found overrepresentation of a missense
allele of the DISC1 gene, leu607 to pro (L607P; dbSNP rs6675281) in
schizoaffective disorder. These data supported the idea that these
apparently distinct disorders have at least a partially convergent
etiology and that variation at the DISC1 locus predisposes individuals
to a variety of psychiatric disorders.

Cannon et al. (2005) conducted a population-based twin cohort study in
Finland to examine the association of SNPs of DISC1 and TRAX (TSNAX;
602964) with schizophrenia and several endophenotypic traits thought to
be involved in the disease pathogenesis. Two hundred and thirty-six
subjects consisting of 7 pairs concordant for schizophrenia (6
monozygotic, 1 dizygotic), 52 pairs discordant for schizophrenia (20
monozygotic, 32 dizygotic), and 59 demographically balanced normal pairs
(28 monozygotic, 31 dizygotic) were drawn from a twin cohort consisting
of all same-sex twins born in Finland from 1940 through 1957. Diagnosis
was confirmed and performance on neurocognitive tests of short- and
long-term memory as well as gray matter volume measurements as assessed
on MRI images were recorded. A common haplotype incorporating 3 SNPs
near the translocation breakpoint of DISC1 (HEP1; odds ratio, 2.6; p =
0.02) and a rare haplotype incorporating 4 markers from the DISC1 and
TRAX genes (combined HEP2/HEP3; odds ratio, 13.0; p = 0.001) were
significantly overrepresented among individuals with schizophrenia.
These haplotypes were also associated with several quantitative and
endophenotypic traits including impairments in short- and long-term
memory, functioning, and reduced gray matter density in the prefrontal
cortex.

Song et al. (2008) analyzed the regions of likely functional
significance in the DISC1 gene in 288 patients with schizophrenia and
288 controls. Six patients with schizophrenia were heterozygous for
'ultra-rare' missense variants (R37W, S90L, T603I, G14A, and R418H) not
found in 288 controls (p = 0.015) and shown to be ultra-rare by their
absence in a pool of 10,000 control alleles. Song et al. (2008)
concluded that these variants in DISC1 are associated with an
attributable risk of about 2% for schizophrenia. In addition, they
replicated the finding that 2 common structural variants (Q264R and
S704C) slightly elevate the risk for schizophrenia (OR, 1.3, 95% CI,
1.0-1.7).

Schumacher et al. (2009) reported a circumscribed interval in intron 9
of DISC1, which was significantly associated with schizophrenia in
females (p = 4.0 x 10(-5)) and contributed most strongly to early-onset
cases (p = 9.0 x 10(-5)) in a central European population of 1,621
individuals. The SNP interplay effect between dbSNP rs1538979 and dbSNP
rs821633 significantly conferred disease risk in male patients with
schizophrenia (p = 0.016; OR, 1.57). In a metaanalysis of 9
schizophrenia samples from different European populations covering 50
SNPs, the authors found evidence for a common schizophrenia risk
interval within DISC1 introns 4 to 6 (p = 0.002; OR, 1.27). Schumacher
et al. (2009) proposed a complex association between schizophrenia and
DISC1, including the presence of different risk loci and SNP interplay
effects.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hikida et al. (2007) developed a transgenic mouse model expressing a
dominant-negative truncated form of human DISC1. In vivo brain MRI
showed enlarged lateral ventricles particularly on the left side in
juvenile mutant mice, similar to asymmetric brain changes observed in
patients with schizophrenia. There was also selective reduction of
immunoreactivity to parvalbumin (PVALB; 168890) in the cortex, marking a
possible interneuron deficit. Mutant mice displayed several behavioral
abnormalities, including hyperactivity, disturbances in sensorimotor
gating and olfactory-associated behavior, and an
anhedonia/depression-like deficit. Hikida et al. (2007) suggested that
the dominant-negative human DISC1 transgenic mouse could be an animal
model for schizophrenia.

Li et al. (2007) used an inducible and reversible transgenic system to
demonstrate that early postnatal, but not adult induction, of mutant
C-terminal DISC1 in mice resulted in a cluster of schizophrenia-related
phenotypes, including reduced hippocampal dendritic complexity,
decreased hippocampal synaptic transmission, depressive-like traits,
abnormal spatial working memory, and reduced sociability. Li et al.
(2007) postulated that alterations in DISC1 function during brain
development may contribute to pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

Clapcote et al. (2007) reported the behavioral phenotypes of 2
ENU-induced Disc1 mouse mutants: Q31L and L100P, both in exon 2. All
mutant mice were viable and grossly indistinguishable from their
wildtype littermates. L110P-mutant mice showed a schizophrenic-like
phenotype, with decreased prepulse inhibition and latent inhibition that
could be ameliorated by antipsychotic treatment. In contrast,
Q31L-mutant mice showed depressive-like behavior, with deficits in the
forced swim test and other measures that could be reversed by treatment
with the antidepressant buproprion, but not by rolipram, a PDE4
inhibitor. Brain MRI showed decreased brain volume in L100P-mutant mice
(decreased by 13%) and L31-mutant mice (decreased by 6%). Both mutant
Disc1 proteins showed decreased binding to PDE4B, and Q31L-mutant mice
had decreased PDE4B activity in the brain.

Kvajo et al. (2008) generated mice carrying a deletion in the mouse
Disc1 gene, resulting in premature termination, that modeled the
disease-associated translocation identified in humans and associated
with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder by Blackwood et al. (2001).
Mutant mice had alterations in the organization of newly born and mature
neurons of the dentate gyrus. Field recordings showed a deficit in
short-term plasticity in the hippocampus of mutant mice. Both homozygous
and heterozygous mutant mice showed a selective impairment in working
memory during a battery of cognitive tests. The results were consistent
with malfunction of neural circuits.

Wood et al. (2009) mapped the expression of zebrafish Disc1 and studied
its role in early embryonic development using morpholino antisense
methods. There was a critical requirement for Disc1 in oligodendrocyte
development by promoting specification of Olig2 (606386)-positive cells
in the hindbrain and other brain regions. Disruption of neuregulin
(Nrg1; 142445) and ErbB (EGFR; 131550) signaling in zebrafish brain
development yielded similar defects to those seen in disc1 morphant
embryos. Knockdown of Disc1 or Nrg1 caused near total loss of
Olig2-positive cerebellar neurons, but caused no apparent loss of spinal
motor neurons. Wood et al. (2009) suggested that Disc1 and Nrg1 function
in common or related pathways controlling development of
oligodendrocytes and neurons from Olig2-expressing precursor cells.

In developing mouse hippocampus, Meyer and Morris (2009) showed that in
utero electroporation of Disc1 short hairpin RNAs hindered the migration
of dentate gyrus granule cells. Disc1 knockdown did not affect the
migration of CA1 pyramidal neurons, suggesting that the role of Disc1 in
regulating neuronal migration may be spatially restricted within the
hippocampus. Meyer and Morris (2009) suggested that DISC1 abnormalities
that contribute to the onset of schizophrenia may do so through their
influences on hippocampal development.

Using in utero RNA interference transfer, Niwa et al. (2010) showed that
transient knockdown of Disc1 in prefrontal cortex in mice at embryonic
day 14 led to maturation-dependent deficits in mesocortical dopaminergic
projections and associated behavioral changes, including those in
information processing and cognition.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SCHIZOPHRENIA 9
DISC1, HAPLOTYPE, HEP3

Hennah et al. (2003) identified a common haplotype, HEP3, that was
undertransmitted in Finnish females with schizophrenia (SCZD9; 604906).
The HEP3 haplotype contains 2 SNPS in the DISC1 gene (dbSNP rs751229,
dbSNP rs3738401) that span 62 kb from intron 1 to exon 2. Hodgkinson et
al. (2004) confirmed underrepresentation of the HEP3 haplotype in
individuals with schizoaffective disorder.

Hennah et al. (2005) tested whether identified allelic haplotypes of
TRAX (602964)/DISC were associated with visual or verbal memory
dysfunction known to aggregate with schizophrenia in families. The HEP3
haplotype of DISC1 displayed association with poorer performance on
tests assessing short-term visual memory and attention. Analysis of
affected and unaffected offspring separately revealed that both samples
contributed to the observed association in visual working memory. The
results provided genetic support for the view that the DISC1 gene
contributes to sensitivity to schizophrenia and affects short-term
visual memory functions.

Among Finnish twin pairs discordant for the HEP3 haplotype, Li et al.
(2007) found a significant association between presence of the haplotype
and decreased sociability, suggesting that DISC1 has an effect on social
behavior.

186946	TITLE *186946 FK506-BINDING PROTEIN 2; FKBP2
;;FK506-BINDING PROTEIN, T-CELL, 13-KD; FKBP13
DESCRIPTION For background information on FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), see FKBP1A
(186945).

CLONING

Jin et al. (1991) reported the cloning and subcellular localization of a
13-kD FK506-binding protein (FKBP13), which has a 21-amino acid signal
peptide and appears to be membrane-associated. The 120-amino acid mature
protein appears to lack a transmembrane domain but a potential
endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence (arg-thr-glu-leu) is found at
its C terminus. FKBP13 shares 51% nucleotide sequence identity and 43%
amino acid sequence identity with FKBP12 (FKBP1; 186945), the
predominant FK506- and rapamycin-binding protein in human T cells. Jin
et al. (1991) noted that conserved residues that comprise the drug
binding site and rotamase active site of FKBP12 are completely conserved
in FKBP13.

GENE STRUCTURE

DiLella et al. (1992) found that the FKBP2 gene is 3 kb long and
contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, DiLella et al. (1992) mapped the
FKBP2 gene to 11q13.1-q13.3.

Courseaux et al. (1996) used a combination of methods to refine maps of
the approximately 5-Mb region of 11q13 that includes MEN1 (131100). They
proposed the following gene order:
cen--PGA--FTH1--UGB--AHNAK--ROM1--MDU1--CHRM1--COX8--EMK1--FKBP2--PLCB3--[PYGM,
ZFM1]--FAU--CAPN1--[MLK3, RELA]--FOSL1--SEA--CFL1--tel.

607991	TITLE *607991 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 8 (SODIUM-CALCIUM EXCHANGER), MEMBER 3; SLC8A3
;;SODIUM-CALCIUM EXCHANGER 3; NCX3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Plasma membrane sodium-calcium exchangers, such as SLC8A3, are
reversible transporters controlling Ca(2+) homeostasis. The forward
sodium-calcium exchange extrudes 1 Ca(2+) for 3 extracellular Na(+)
ions, using the Na(+) gradient and the electrical potential across the
plasma membrane as an energy source.

CLONING

Nicoll et al. (1996) cloned rat Slc8a3, which they designated Ncx3. The
deduced 927-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide, 11
transmembrane segments, a long cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane
segments 5 and 6, and alpha and beta repeat sequences characteristic of
exchange proteins. The authors predicted that the N terminus is
extracellular and the C terminus is intracellular. Slc8a3 contains 5
N-glycosylation sites and 4 phosphorylation sites. Northern blot
analysis of rat tissues detected a 6.0-kb transcript only in brain and
skeletal muscle.

By searching databases for sequences similar to rat Slc8a3, followed by
RT-PCR of neuroblastoma cell line total RNA, Gabellini et al. (2002)
cloned SLC8A3, which they designated NCX3. The deduced 921-amino acid
protein contains an N-terminal cluster of 5 transmembrane domains and a
C-terminal cluster of 5 transmembrane domains. The clusters are
separated by a large hydrophilic intracellular loop. Gabellini et al.
(2002) identified complex alternative splicing in the exons encoding the
intracellular loop. The form expressed in brain and the neuroblastoma
cell line has 7 of 9 exons, lacking exons 3 and 5. In addition to this
isoform, 2 other isoforms were expressed in skeletal muscle: one lacking
only exon 3, and the other lacking exons 3, 4, and 5, resulting in a
terminating frameshift. The predicted proteins range in size from 68 to
100 kD. The coding region of SLC8A3 shares 68% and 71% amino acid
identity with SLC8A1 (182305) and SLC8A2 (601901), respectively, and 97%
identity with rat Slc8a3.

GENE FUNCTION

Nicoll et al. (1996) determined that transfection of rat Slc8a3 into
baby hamster kidney cells mediated a 12-fold increase in Na(+)
gradient-dependent Ca(2+) uptake relative to control cells.

Using promoter-reporter constructs, Gabellini et al. (2002) found that
expression of the SLC8A3 promoter in neuroblastoma cells was promoted by
retinoic acid, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (113505), and rising
cAMP levels. Ca(2+) was inhibitory, and inhibition was mediated by CAMK2
(see 114078)-directed phosphorylation of CREB (see 123810).

GENE STRUCTURE

Gabellini et al. (2002) determined that the SLC8A3 gene contains 9 exons
and spans about 150 kb. Exon 1 is untranslated.

Gabellini et al. (2002) determined that the promoter region of SLC8A3
contains a TATA box and several GC boxes, indicating constitutive
transcription. It also includes binding sites for brain-specific AP2
(107580) transcription factor and for muscle-specific MyoD (159970),
GATA2 (137295), and GATA3 (131320).

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gabellini et al. (2002) mapped the SLC8A3
gene to chromosome 14q24.2. Nicoll et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Slc8a3
gene to chromosome 12.

ANIMAL MODEL

Sokolow et al. (2004) produced mice deficient in Ncx3. Ncx3-deficient
mice presented a skeletal muscle fiber necrosis and a defective
neuromuscular transmission, reflecting the absence of Ncx3 in the
sarcolemma of the muscle fibers and at the neuromuscular junction. The
defective neuromuscular transmission was characterized by the presence
of electromyographic abnormalities. The findings indicated that NCX3
plays an important role in vivo in the control of Ca(2+) concentrations
in skeletal muscle fibers and at the neuromuscular junction.

Molinaro et al. (2008) demonstrated that homozygous ablation of the Ncx3
gene in mice increased the extent of ischemic brain lesions after middle
cerebral artery occlusion, particularly in the temporoparietal cortex,
compared to controls. Cultured hippocampal cells from Ncx3-deficient
mice showed significantly increased cell death in response to oxygen
glucose deprivation compared to wildtype cells. Hypoxic conditions
increased the reverse mode of the transporter in wildtype cells, but
this reverse current was significantly decreased in Ncx3-deficient
cells. The findings indicated impaired Ca(2+) and Na(+) homeostasis
resulting from absence of Ncx3. Molinaro et al. (2008) noted that NCX3
activity is ATP-independent and can thus function normally even during
ischemic conditions, and suggested that wildtype Ncx3 may have
beneficial effects during hypoxic conditions by decreasing cellular
Na(+) content in the initial stages.

;;HERPESVIRUS ENTRY MEDIATOR; HVEM;;
HERPESVIRUS ENTRY MEDIATOR A; HVEA;;
TR2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TNFRSF14, or HVEM, activates NF-kappa-B (see 164011) through the
canonical TNF-related cytokine LIGHT (TNFSF14; 604520), serving as a
costimulatory pathway during activation of T cells. TNFRSF14 also
functions as a ligand for the immunoglobulin superfamily members BTLA
(607925) and CD160 (604463), both of which limit inflammatory responses
initiated by T cells (summary by Cheung et al., 2009).

CLONING

Members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family play a key
role in regulating the immune response to infection (see TNFR1, 191190).
By screening for genes that could mediate the entry of herpes simplex
virus (HSV) into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, Montgomery et al.
(1996) identified cDNAs encoding HVEM, a member of the TNFR family. The
predicted 283-amino acid protein has characteristics of a type I
membrane glycoprotein, with an N-terminal signal peptide, 2 potential
sites for addition of N-linked glycans, and a putative membrane-spanning
domain. HVEM contains a cysteine-rich repeat region characteristic of
TNFR family members and shares 17 to 25% amino acid identity with other
TNFRs.

Independently, Kwon et al. (1997) cloned cDNAs encoding HVEM, which they
designated TR2. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.7-kb mRNA in several
tissues, with the highest expression in lung, spleen, and thymus.
Several additional larger mRNAs were observed in some tissues, and
several of the cDNAs contained insertions in the coding region, leading
Kwon et al. (1997) to suggest that HVEM is regulated at the level of
mRNA maturation. These authors reported that the in vitro translation
product was 32 kD by SDS-PAGE.

Marsters et al. (1997) also identified HVEM as a novel member of the
TNFR family. They attributed differences between their predicted amino
acid sequence and that of Montgomery et al. (1996) to polymorphism.

Hsu et al. (1997) cloned cDNAs for the mouse HVEM homolog, which they
designated ATAR (another TRAF-associated receptor). The predicted
276-amino acid mouse protein shares only 45% protein sequence identity
with human HVEM.

GENE FUNCTION

Montgomery et al. (1996) suggested that HVEM plays an important role in
HSV pathogenesis because it enhanced the entry of several wildtype HSV
strains of both serotypes into CHO cells, and mediated HSV entry into
activated human T cells.

Using epitope-tagged HVEM, Marsters et al. (1997) found that HVEM
interacted in vivo with several TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) proteins,
including TRAF1 (601711), TRAF2 (601895), TRAF3 (601896), and TRAF5
(602356). Expression of HVEM activated JNK1 (601158), NF-kappa-B, and
AP1 (165160), which control expression of multiple genes in response to
infection or cellular stress. Marsters et al. (1997) concluded that HVEM
is linked via TRAFs to signal transduction pathways that activate the
immune response.

By flow cytometric and RT-PCR analysis, Morel et al. (2000) showed that
the expression of the HVEM ligand, LIGHT, is upregulated, whereas HVEM
expression is downregulated, after T-cell activation, particularly
CD8-positive T-cell activation.

Using tetramer analysis, Sedy et al. (2005) found that the extracellular
Ig domain of BTLA interacted with the most membrane-distal cysteine-rich
domain of HVEM. Flow cytometric and Western blot analyses showed that
HVEM induced BTLA tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibited T-cell
proliferation in a BTLA-dependent manner.

By surface plasmon resonance analysis of a secreted protein library,
Gonzalez et al. (2005) identified HVEM as a specific, high-affinity
coreceptor for BTLA. HVEM bound LIGHT at a site distinct from that bound
by BTLA, and the 3 proteins could form a ternary complex. The
BTLA-binding site in HVEM overlapped with that for HSV glycoprotein D,
indicating that BTLA likely interacts with the first cysteine-rich
domain of HVEM. Binding of HVEM to BTLA inhibited T-cell proliferation.
Gonzalez et al. (2005) concluded that HVEM and BTLA form an inhibitory
coreceptor pair.

Using flow cytometry, Western blot, and immunocytochemical analyses and
reporter assays, Cheung et al. (2009) demonstrated that
membrane-expressed or soluble herpes virus envelope glycoprotein D,
BTLA, and CD160 (604463) functioned as activating ligands of HVEM,
promoting NFKB activation and cell survival. BTLA and CD160 engagement
induced the recruitment of TRAF2, but not TRAF3, to HVEM, which
specifically activated the RELA (164014), but not the RELB (604758),
form of NFKB. Cheung et al. (2009) concluded that HVEM and BTLA form a
bidirectional signaling pathway regulating cell survival and inhibitory
responses between interacting cells.

Shui et al. (2012) reported an important role for epithelial HVEM in
innate mucosal defense against pathogenic bacteria. HVEM enhances immune
responses by NF-kappa-B-inducing kinase-dependent STAT3 (102582)
activation, which promotes the epithelial expression of genes important
for immunity. During intestinal Citrobacter rodentium infection, a mouse
model for enteropathogenic E. coli infection, Hvem-null mice showed
decreased Stat3 activation, impaired responses in the colon, higher
bacterial burdens, and increased mortality. Shui et al. (2012)
identified the immunoglobulin superfamily molecule CD160, expressed
predominantly by innate-like intraepithelial lymphocytes, as the ligand
engaging epithelial HVEM for host protection. Likewise, in pulmonary
Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, HVEM is also required for host
defense. Shui et al. (2012) concluded that their results pinpointed HVEM
as an important orchestrator of mucosal immunity, integrating signals
from innate lymphocytes to induce optimal epithelial Stat3 activation,
which indicated that targeting HVEM with agonists could improve host
defense.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

HSV infection requires binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein D (gD)
to cell surface receptors. Carfi et al. (2001) reported the x-ray
structures of a soluble, truncated ectodomain of gD both alone and in
complex with the ectodomain of its cellular receptor, TNFRSF14, which
they called HVEA. Two bound anions suggested possible binding sites for
another gD receptor, a 3-O-sulfonated heparan sulfate. The structures
revealed a V-like immunoglobulin fold at the core of gD that is closely
related to cellular adhesion molecules and flanked by large N- and
C-terminal extensions. The receptor-binding segment of gD, an N-terminal
hairpin, appeared conformationally flexible, suggesting that a
conformational change accompanying binding might be part of the viral
entry mechanism.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Kwon et al. (1997) mapped the
HVEM gene to 1p36.3-p36.2. This region also contains the TNFR genes CD30
(153243), ILA (602250), TXGP1L (600315), and TNFR2 (191191), suggesting
that HVEM evolved through a localized gene duplication event.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a mouse model of acute hepatitis, Wahl et al. (2009) showed that
Hvem -/- mice had lower serum alanine transaminase (GPT; 138200) levels
and lower Ifng (147570), but higher protective Il22 (605330) levels.
Histologic analysis showed attenuated disease in Hvem -/- mice. Flow
cytometric analysis demonstrated reduced numbers of liver invariant NKT
cells, but these cells produced more Il22 and less Ifng than wildtype
liver invariant NKT cells. Neutralization of Il22 aggravated disease in
both wildtype and Hvem -/- mice. Wahl et al. (2009) concluded that Hvem
expression promotes pathogenic, proinflammatory Th1 responses and
diminishes protective Il22 responses in this hepatitis model.

Steinberg et al. (2008) transferred naive Cd4 (186940)-positive/Cd45rb
(151460)-high T cells, depleted of Cd25 (147730)-positive regulatory T
cells, from Hvem -/- or wildtype mice into Rag (see 179615) -/- mice.
They found that the naive wildtype T cells, and to a lesser extent the
Hvem -/- T cells, induced progressive disease and colitis. However, in
recipient mice that also lacked Hvem, there was a dramatic acceleration
of intestinal inflammation, accompanied by increased T-cell cytokine
production. Transfer of naive T cells into Hvem -/- Rag -/- recipients
treated with anti-Btla reduced both cytokine production in vitro and
colitis development in vivo. Steinberg et al. (2008) concluded that HVEM
can act as a receptor to enhance immune responses by binding LIGHT and
as a ligand to suppress immune responses by binding BTLA.

135940	TITLE *135940 FILAGGRIN; FLG
PROFILAGGRIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Profilaggrin is a major protein component of the keratohyalin granules
of mammalian epidermis. It is initially expressed as a large polyprotein
precursor which is subsequently proteolytically processed into
individual functional filaggrin molecules. The filaggrins show wide
species variations and their aberrant expression has been implicated in
a number of keratinizing disorders (Baden et al., 1974; Holbrook et al.,
1982; Sybert et al., 1985).

CLONING

McKinley-Grant et al. (1989) isolated a cDNA clone encoding human
filaggrin. They demonstrated that the human gene encodes a polyprotein
precursor containing numerous tandem filaggrin repeats. This structure
is similar to that of the mouse; however, the human filaggrin repeat is
much longer (972 basepairs; 324 amino acids) and shows little sequence
homology to the mouse protein. They found furthermore that the human
filaggrin repeats show considerable sequence variations; such
polymorphism is not found in the mouse. By peptide mapping, they defined
a short linker sequence within the human filaggrin repeat that is
excised by proteolysis to yield functional molecules. They showed by in
situ hybridization that the expression of the gene for the human
filaggrin precursor is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level in
terminally differentiating epidermis.

Gan et al. (1990) isolated genomic DNA and cDNA clones encoding the
5-prime and 3-prime ends of the human gene and mRNA. They found evidence
of likely CAT and TATA sequences, an intron in the 5-prime untranslated
region, and several potential regulatory sequences. The gene is made up
of repeats, all of the same length. Sequences showed considerable
variation, most attributable to single-base changes. Thus, human
filaggrin consists of a heterogeneous population of molecules of
different sizes, charges, and sequences. Amino acid sequences encoding
the amino and carboxyl termini were more conserved, as were the 5-prime
and 3-prime DNA sequences flanking the coding portions of the gene. The
presence of unique restriction enzyme sites in these conserved flanking
sequences enabled Gan et al. (1990) to calculate the size of the
full-length gene and the number of repeats in it; depending on the
source of genomic DNA, the gene contains 10, 11, or 12 filaggrin repeats
that segregate in families in a normal mendelian manner. Thus, the human
profilaggrin gene is polymorphic with respect to size due to simple
allelic differences between individuals.

GENE STRUCTURE

The FLG gene comprises 3 exons (Presland et al., 1992).

MAPPING

Using a cDNA clone as a probe in the study of a panel of mouse-human
somatic cell hybrids retaining overlapping subsets of human chromosomal
regions and for chromosomal in situ hybridization, McKinley-Grant et al.
(1989) demonstrated that the human filaggrin gene maps to 1q21.
Rothnagel et al. (1994) mapped the homologous gene to mouse chromosome 3
by PCR analyses of DNAs isolated from mouse/Chinese hamster somatic cell
hybrids.

Genes of 3 protein families that are specifically expressed in the
course of terminal differentiation of human epidermis have been mapped
to 1q21. Volz et al. (1993) showed that these genes are physically
linked within 2.05 Mb of DNA in the following order: calpactin I light
chain (CAL1L; 114085), trichohyalin (THL; 190370), profilaggrin,
involucrin (IVL; 147360), small proline-rich protein (SPRR1A; 182265),
loricrin (LOR; 152445), and calcyclin (CACY; 114110).

GENE FUNCTION

Smith et al. (2006) reviewed the function of filaggrin, also known as
filament-aggregating protein, in the formation of the stratum corneum.
Keratohyalin granules in the granular layer of interfollicular epidermis
are predominantly composed of the 400-kD protein profilaggrin. Following
a short, unique N-terminal domain, most of the profilaggrin molecule
consists of 10 to 12 repeats of the 324-residue filaggrin sequence (Gan
et al., 1990). Upon terminal differentiation of granular cells,
profilaggrin is proteolytically cleaved into filaggrin peptides of
approximately 37 kD and the N-terminal domain containing an S100-like
calcium-binding domain. Filaggrin rapidly aggregates the keratin
cytoskeleton, causing collapse of the granular cells into flattened
anuclear squames. This condensed cytoskeleton is crosslinked by
transglutaminases during formation of the cornified cell envelope (CCE).
The CCE is the outermost barrier layer of the skin which not only
prevents water loss but also impedes the entry of allergens and
infectious agents. Filaggrin is therefore a key protein in facilitating
epidermal differentiation and maintaining barrier function.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 15 kindreds with ichthyosis vulgaris (146700), Smith et al. (2006)
identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations R501X
(135940.0001) and 2282del4 (135940.0002) in the FLG gene in individuals
with a moderate or severe phenotype. They concluded that these mutations
are semidominant; heterozygotes show a very mild phenotype with
incomplete penetrance. The mutations showed a combined allele frequency
of approximately 4% in populations of European ancestry, explaining the
high incidence of ichthyosis vulgaris. Profilaggrin is the major protein
of keratohyalin granules in the epidermis. During terminal
differentiation, it is cleaved into multiple filaggrin peptides that
aggregate keratin filaments. The resultant matrix is crosslinked to form
a major component of the cornified cell envelope. Smith et al. (2006)
found that loss or reduction of this major structural protein leads to
varying degrees of impaired keratinization.

Twin and family studies have indicated a highly heritable predisposition
to atopic disease, including atopic dermatitis (see 603165), allergy,
and asthma (see 600807). Although genetic studies have focused on
immunologic mechanisms of atopic dermatitis, a primary epithelial
barrier defect has been anticipated (Cookson and Moffatt, 2002).
Filaggrin is a key protein that facilitates terminal differentiation of
the epidermis and formation of the skin barrier. Palmer et al. (2006)
showed that 2 independent loss-of-function genetic variants, R501X
(135940.0001) and 2282del4 (135940.0002), in the FLG gene are very
strong predisposing factors for atopic dermatitis (605803). These
mutations had been shown to be the cause of ichthyosis vulgaris in 15
families and isolated cases (Smith et al., 2006). The R501X and 2282del4
variants, carried by approximately 9% of people of European origin, also
showed highly significant association with asthma occurring in the
context of atopic dermatitis. This work established a key role for
impaired skin barrier function in the development of atopic disease.

Sandilands et al. (2007) showed that the 2 common filaggrin-null
mutations reported by Smith et al. (2006) and Palmer et al. (2006) are
ancestral European variants carried on conserved haplotypes. To
facilitate comprehensive analysis in other populations, they reported a
strategy for full sequencing of this large, highly repetitive gene, and
described 15 variants, including 7 that are prevalent. All the variants
were either nonsense or frameshift mutations that, in representative
cases, resulted in loss of filaggrin production in the epidermis. In an
Irish case-control study, the 5 most common European mutations showed a
strong association with moderate to severe childhood eczema. They found
3 additional rare null mutations in this case series, suggesting that
the genetic architecture of filaggrin-related atopic dermatitis consists
of both prevalent and rare risk alleles.

Using the transmission-disequilibrium test in 476 German
parent-offspring trios with atopic dermatitis, Weidinger et al. (2006)
found a significant association between the loss-of-function mutations
R501X and 2282del4 in the FLG gene and extrinsic atopic dermatitis,
allergic sensitization, total IgE level, asthma, and palmar
hyperlinearity; there was no significant association with intrinsic
atopic dermatitis.

Marenholz et al. (2006) genotyped 1092 children with eczema (atopic
dermatitis) from 2 large European populations for the R501X and 2282del4
mutations in the FLG gene and confirmed a highly significant association
between the null mutations and eczema and concomitant asthma. Moreover,
the authors found that these mutations predisposed to asthma, allergic
rhinitis, and allergic sensitization only in the presence of eczema,
highlighting the importance of the epidermal barrier in the pathogenesis
of these disorders (the so-called 'atopic march').

Nomura et al. (2007) sequenced the entire FLG gene in 7 Japanese
patients with ichthyosis vulgaris from 4 unrelated families who were
negative for the R501X and 2282del4 mutations, and identified
heterozygosity for 2 novel mutations, S2554X (135940.0003) and 3321delA
(135940.0004), respectively. The authors then screened 143 Japanese
patients with atopic dermatitis from 140 unrelated families for the
novel null mutations and identified S2554X in 6 patients and 3321delA in
2 patients; they were not found in 156 unrelated Japanese nonatopic and
nonichthyotic controls, yielding a chi-square p value of 0.0015. Noting
that the R501X and 2282del4 mutations were absent from a total of 253
Japanese individuals, including their patients with ichthyosis vulgaris
and atopic dermatitis, Nomura et al. (2007) concluded that FLG mutations
in Japan are different from those found in European-origin populations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Netherton syndrome (256500) is an autosomal recessive multisystemic
disorder characterized by congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, hair
shaft defects and atopy, caused by mutation in the SPINK5 gene (605010).
Hewett et al. (2005) created mice with an R820X mutation in the Spink5
gene. Newborn homozygotes developed a severe ichthyosis with a loss of
skin barrier function and dehydration, resulting in death within a few
hours. Biochemical analysis of skin revealed a substantial increase in
the proteolytic processing of profilaggrin into its constituent
filaggrin monomers. The authors suggested that in the absence of SPINK5
there is an abnormal increase in the processing of profilaggrin, and
that this may play a direct role in the observed deficit in the adhesion
of the stratum corneum and the severely compromised epidermal barrier
function.

Fallon et al. (2009) reported a 1-bp deletion mutation, 5303delA,
analogous to common human FLG mutations, within the murine Flg gene in
the spontaneous mouse mutant 'flaky tail' (ft). Fallon et al. (2009)
demonstrated that topical application of allergen to mice homozygous for
this mutation resulted in cutaneous inflammatory infiltrates and
enhanced cutaneous allergen priming with development of
allergen-specific antibody responses. These data validated flaky tail as
a useful model of filaggrin deficiency and provided experimental
evidence for the hypothesis that antigen transfer through a defective
epidermal barrier is a key mechanism underlying elevated IgE
sensitization and initiation of cutaneous inflammation in humans with
filaggrin-related atopic disease.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ICHTHYOSIS VULGARIS
DERMATITIS, ATOPIC, 2, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
FLG, ARG501TER

In 7 unrelated ichthyosis vulgaris (146700) families and 8 additional
'sporadic' cases from Ireland, Scotland, and the U.S., Smith et al.
(2006) found that ichthyosis vulgaris was associated with an
arg501-to-stop (R501X) mutation arising from a 1501C-to-T transition
near the start of repeat 1 in exon 3 of the FLG gene. In 3 families,
ichthyosis vulgaris patients with a very pronounced phenotype were
homozygous for R501X. In other families and isolated cases, they found
individuals with the marked ichthyosis vulgaris phenotype to be compound
heterozygous for R501X and a second mutation, 2282del4, in exon 3
(135940.0002).

Ichthyosis vulgaris is semidominant: that is, heterozygotes had either
no discernible phenotype or milder ichthyosis, whereas homozygotes or
compound heterozygotes had marked ichthyosis and an overt histologic
skin barrier defect. In an extension of the work of Smith et al. (2006),
Palmer et al. (2006) noted that in their families with ichthyosis
vulgaris, many individuals null or heterozygous for filaggrin also had
atopic dermatitis (605803) (eczema) and, in a few cases, also had asthma
(see 600807). Specifically, atopic dermatitis was prevalent in the
individuals with mild ichthyosis vulgaris, all of whom were heterozygous
for either the R501X or 2282del4 FLG-null allele (13/29; 44%). Atopic
dermatitis was particularly common in individuals with severe ichthyosis
vulgaris, all of whom were homozygous or compound heterozygous for
FLG-null alleles (16/21; 76%). None of the individuals in these families
who lacked an FLG-null allele had atopic dermatitis (n = 13). Thus,
atopic dermatitis is inherited as a semidominant trait in these
families, with high penetrance in FLG-null homozygotes or compound
heterozygotes and reduced penetrance in heterozygotes.

Using the transmission-disequilibrium test in 476 German
parent-offspring trios with atopic dermatitis, Weidinger et al. (2006)
found a significant association between the loss-of-function mutations
R501X and 2282del4 in the FLG gene and extrinsic atopic dermatitis,
allergic sensitization, total IgE level, asthma, and palmar
hyperlinearity; there was no significant association with intrinsic
atopic dermatitis.

Marenholz et al. (2006) genotyped 1092 children with eczema (atopic
dermatitis) from 2 large European populations for the R501X and 2282del4
mutations in the FLG gene and replicated the highly significant
association between the null mutations and eczema and concomitant
asthma. Moreover, the authors found that these mutations predisposed to
asthma, allergic rhinitis, and allergic sensitization only in the
presence of eczema, and that the mutations predisposed equally to atopic
(intrinsic) and nonatopic (extrinsic) forms of eczema. They demonstrated
that the presence of 2 null alleles is an independent risk factor for
asthma in children with eczema (OR, 11.76, p = 0.0085). Together, the 2
mutations accounted for approximately 11% of eczema cases in the German
population.

See 135940.0001 and Smith et al. (2006). The 2282del4 mutation leads to
a premature termination codon 107 bp downstream and, like R501X, stops
protein translation within the first filaggrin repeat.

Palmer et al. (2006) found an association of the 2282del4 and R501X
genetic variants of the FLG gene with atopic dermatitis; see
135940.0001.

Weidinger et al. (2006) found a significant association between atopic
dermatitis, in particular the extrinsic type, and the R501X and 2282del4
mutations; Marenholz et al. (2006) replicated the association and also
found that the presence of 2 null alleles was an independent risk factor
for asthma in children with eczema. See 135940.0001.

FLG, SER2554TER

In affected members of 2 unrelated Japanese families with ichthyosis
vulgaris (146700) who were negative for previously identified null
mutations in the FLG gene, Nomura et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 7661C-G transversion in exon 3 of the FLG gene,
resulting in a ser2554-to-ter (S2554X) substitution, predicted to cause
premature termination of profilaggrin translation in the filaggrin
repeat domain 7. The older sister of 1 proband, who had a severe
presentation of the disease, was found to be homozygous for S2554X. The
authors then screened 143 Japanese patients with atopic dermatitis
(605803) from 140 unrelated families for this null mutation and
identified S2554X in 6 patients. The mutation was not found in 156
unrelated nonatopic and nonichthyotic Japanese controls.

In 2 probands from 2 unrelated Japanese families with ichthyosis

mutations in the FLG gene, Nomura et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (3321delA) in exon 3 of the FLG gene,
resulting in a premature termination of profilaggrin translation in
filaggrin repeat domain 2. The authors then screened 143 Japanese
patients with atopic dermatitis (605803) from 140 unrelated families for
this deletion and identified 3321delA in 2 patients. The deletion was
not found in 156 unrelated nonatopic and nonichthyotic Japanese
controls.

610999	TITLE *610999 ENHANCER OF POLYCOMB, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; EPC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using RFP (TRIM27; 602165) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a
testis cDNA library, followed by 3-prime and 5-prime RACE, Shimono et
al. (2000) cloned EPC1. The deduced 836-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 92 kD. It has EPcA, EPcB, and EPcC domains
and a Qx region, all of which are highly conserved from yeast to humans.
Endogenous EPC1 localized to nuclear domains and to the nuclear membrane
in a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line.

The NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex is responsible for
acetylation of the N-terminal tails of histone H4 (see 602822) and H2A
(see 613499) in yeast. Its catalytic subunit, Esa1, is homologous to
human TIP60 (HTATIP; 601409). Using affinity purification, Western blot
analysis, cell fractionation, immunoprecipitation, and mass
spectrometry, Doyon et al. (2004) found that TIP60 and its splice
variant, TIP60B/PLIP, were part of a multisubunit NuA4 complex with HAT
activity in several human cell lines. They identified human homologs for
11 of the 12 yeast NuA4 subunits, including EPC1. Two isoforms of EPC1,
containing 813 and 836 amino acids, were detected in the NuA4 complex.

Using HOP (607275) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a heart cDNA
library, Kee et al. (2007) cloned EPC1. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous expression of a 4-kb transcript, with highest levels in heart
and skeletal muscle. Immunohistochemical analysis of embryonic mice
detected decreasing Epc1 expression with age in heart, but increased
expression with age in skeletal muscle. Epc1 was also expressed in
endothelium, spinal ganglia, and cartilage, but not in brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Shimono et al. (2000) found that RFP interacted with EPC1 and that both
proteins repressed gene transcription. Yeast 2-hybrid assays revealed
that the coiled-coil domain of RFP associated with the EPcA domain and
the C-terminal region of EPC. Both proteins coprecipitated from lysates
of human cells and mostly colocalized in the nucleus. The coiled-coil
domain of RFP and the C-terminal region of EPC1 repressed
transcriptional activity in reporter gene assays, whereas the EPcA
domain of EPC1 activated transcriptional activity.

Doyon et al. (2004) found that a recombinant trimeric complex of TIP60,
EPC1, and ING3 (607493) was sufficient to reconstitute nucleasomal HAT
activity in vitro.

Kee et al. (2007) found upregulated expression of Epc1 during
differentiation of a rat myoblast cell line into skeletal myocytes.
Differentiation was induced by Epc1 overexpression and was severely
impaired in Epc1-knockdown cells. Cotransfection of Hop potentiated
Epc1-induced transactivation of myogenin (MYOG; 159980) and myotube
formation. Skeletal muscle of Hop-knockout mice showed decreased
expression of myosin heavy chain (see 160730) and myogenin, and
hamstring muscle of Hop-knockout mice showed delayed healing after
injury. Differentiation was impaired in skeletal myoblasts from
Hop-knockout mice. Kee et al. (2007) concluded that EPC1 plays a role in
initiation of skeletal muscle differentiation and that its interaction
with HOP is required for full activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Somatic Mutation in Pancreatic Cancer

Biankin et al. (2012) performed exome sequencing and copy number
analysis to define genomic aberrations in a prospectively accrued
clinical cohort of 142 patients with early (stage I and II) sporadic
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Detailed analysis of 99 informative
tumors identified substantial heterogeneity with 2,016 nonsilent
mutations and 1,628 copy number variations. Biankin et al. (2012)
defined 16 significantly mutated genes, reaffirming known mutations and
uncovering novel mutated genes including additional genes involved in
chromatin modification (EPC1 and ARID2, 609539), DNA damage repair (ATM;
607585), and other mechanisms (ZIM2 (see 601483); MAP2K4, 601335; NALCN,
611549; SLC16A4, 603878; and MAGEA6, 300176). Integrative analysis with
in vitro functional data and animal models provided supportive evidence
for potential roles for these genetic aberrations in carcinogenesis.
Pathway-based analysis of recurrently mutated genes recapitulated
clustering in core signaling pathways in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma, and identified new mutated genes in each pathway.
Biankin et al. (2012) also identified frequent and diverse somatic
aberrations in genes described traditionally as embryonic regulators of
axon guidance, particularly SLIT/ROBO (see 603742) signaling, which was
also evident in murine Sleeping Beauty transposon-mediated somatic
mutagenesis models of pancreatic cancer, providing further supportive
evidence for the potential involvement of axon guidance genes in
pancreatic carcinogenesis.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Shimono et al. (2000) mapped the EPC1 gene
to chromosome 10p11.

611696	TITLE *611696 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 22, MEMBER 20; SLC22A20
;;ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER 6; OAT6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SLC22A20 belongs to a large family of transmembrane proteins that
function as uniporters, symporters, and antiporters to transport organic
ions across cell membranes (Jacobsson et al., 2007).

CLONING

By searching a human database for SLC22 family members, Jacobsson et al.
(2007) identified SLC22A20. The deduced 573-amino acid protein has 12
putative transmembrane domains. Quantitative real-time PCR detected high
expression of rat Slc22a20 in coronal sections taken through the
olfactory bulb and forebrain. Expression was much weaker in other
coronal sections and in liver and adipose tissue, and was not detected
in other brain regions or in peripheral tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jacobsson et al. (2007) determined that the SLC22A20 gene contains 9
exons.

MAPPING

139380	TITLE *139380 GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING PROTEIN, BETA-1; GNB1
;;TRANSDUCIN, BETA POLYPEPTIDE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins)
transduce extracellular signals received by transmembrane receptors to
effector proteins. Each subunit of the G protein complex is encoded by a
member of 1 of 3 corresponding gene families, alpha, beta, and gamma
(Hurowitz et al., 2000).

CLONING

Retinal transducin is a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein that
activates a cGMP phosphodiesterase in photoreceptor cells. Fong et al.
(1986) identified and analyzed cDNA clones of the bovine transducin beta
subunit and deduced the primary structure of a 340-amino acid protein.
Significant homology was found with the yeast CDC4 gene product. The
beta-subunit polypeptide, of relative molecular mass 37,375 Da, is
encoded by a 2.9-kb mRNA. All mammalian tissues and clonal cell lines
examined contained at least 2 beta-related mRNAs, usually 1.8 and 2.9 kb
long. The authors suggested that there may be a diversity of beta
subunit-related mRNAs that could encode different proteins.

Codina et al. (1986) cloned a full-length G protein beta-1 subunit
(GNB1) from a human liver cDNA library. They found that the deduced
340-amino acid protein is identical to that encoded by bovine retinal
rod cell cDNA of the beta subunit of transducin.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coprecipitation analysis, Rosskopf et al. (2003) showed that GNB1
formed dimers with all gamma subunits analyzed. The strength of the
interaction was variable and was strongest between GNB1 and GNG3
(608941), GNG10 (604389), GNG12, and GNG13 (607298).

GENE STRUCTURE

Rosskopf et al. (2003) determined that the GNB1 gene contains 12 exons.
The first 2 exons and the last exon are noncoding.

MAPPING

Using a cDNA probe against a mouse/human somatic cell hybrid panel,
Sparkes et al. (1987) mapped the human beta-1 polypeptide of G protein
to human chromosome 1. Levine et al. (1990) confirmed the assignment to
chromosome 1 by Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrids, and Levine et
al. (1990) and Modi et al. (1991) regionalized the assignment to
1pter-p31.2 by in situ hybridization. Although Sparkes et al. (1987) had
mapped the mouse Gnb1 gene to chromosome 19, later studies showed that
Gnb1 is located on distal mouse chromosome 4 (Danciger et al., 1990).

ANIMAL MODEL

In the Rd4/+ mouse, autosomal dominant retinal degeneration cosegregates
with a large inversion spanning nearly all of chromosome 4 (Roderick et
al., 1997). To identify the responsible gene for this phenotype,
Kitamura et al. (2006) focused on the distal breakpoint and found that
it lay in the second intron of the Gnb1 gene, coding for the
transducin-beta-1 protein, which is directly involved in
phototransduction and in the normal maintenance of photoreceptors.
Kitamura et al. (2006) determined that before the beginning of retinal
degeneration in the Rd4/+ retina, the levels of Gnb1 mRNA and
transducin-beta-1 were 50% of those in wildtype retina. Kitamura et al.
(2006) suggested that disruption of the Gnb1 gene is responsible for
Rd4/+ retinal disease.

3; TSSC3;;
TUMOR-SUPPRESSING STF cDNA 3;;
IMPRINTED IN PLACENTA AND LIVER; IPL;;
BECKWITH-WIEDEMANN REGION 1C; BWR1C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

A region of 11p15.5 contains several genes with documented functional
imprinting, defined as a consistent allelic bias of RNA expression in
somatic tissues. Imprinted genes in this region include H19 (103280),
IGF2 (147470), CDKN1C (600856), and KVLQT1 (607542). The size of the
region that contains these genes is approximately 1 Mb, similar to the
Prader-Willi syndrome (176270)/Angelman syndrome (105830) region of
chromosome 15, which also contains multiple imprinted genes. Qian et al.
(1997) stated that a strong sex bias in the rates of meiotic
recombination in imprinted regions suggested an accessibility model for
genomic imprinting in which extended regions of 'open chromatin'
specific to one type of gamete are selectively modified epigenetically,
leading to allele-specific transcription of at least a subset of the
genes in these regions in the offspring. A prediction is that a
positional cloning approach, i.e., chromosome walking in the vicinity of
known imprinted genes, should be successful in isolating additional
imprinted genes. Qian et al. (1997) described the human and mouse
versions of a novel imprinted gene, symbolized IPL (for 'imprinted in
placenta and liver') by them, that they identified by this approach. IPL
is located between NAP2 (601651) on the centromeric side and KIP2
(CDKN1C; 600856) on the telomeric side. In many human and mouse tissues,
the gene showed tissue-specific expression and functional imprinting,
with the maternal allele active and the paternal allele relatively
inactive. The mouse and human genes showed sequence similarity to
TDAG51, a gene that had been shown to be essential for FAS (134637) gene
expression and susceptibility to apoptosis in a T lymphocyte cell line.
Qian et al. (1997) detected high expression in the placenta, with lower
expression in the chorioamniotic membrane and a very low expression in
fetal and adult liver, lung, and kidney and adult pancreas.

By genetic analysis of a 170-kb region at 11p15.5 between loci D11S601
and D11S679, Schwienbacher et al. (1998) identified 6 transcriptional
units. Three of these, NAP2, CDKN1C, and KVLQT1, had been well
characterized, whereas the other 3 genes were novel. These were
symbolized BWR1A (602631), BWR1B (603240), and BWR1C, with BWR
designating 'Beckwith-Wiedemann region.'

GENE FUNCTION

Muller et al. (2000) stated that TSSC3 is the first apoptosis-related
gene found to be imprinted in placenta, liver, and fetal tissues, where
it is expressed from the maternal allele during normal human
development. Since several embryonal tumors show loss of imprinting of
genes in the 11p15.5 region, Muller et al. (2000) investigated the
imprinting status of TSSC3 in normal human adult brain, neuroblastomas,
medulloblastomas, and glioblastomas. Using a polymorphism in exon 1,
they found that the TSSC3 gene is not imprinted in normal human adult
brain or blood. In contrast, strong allelic bias resembling imprinting
could be detected in most tumors examined. The authors concluded that
the tumors under investigation are associated with a retention of
imprinting of a potential growth inhibitory gene.

MAPPING

Qian et al. (1997) identified the PHLDA2 gene on chromosome 11p15.5, in
a region that contains many imprinted genes. Qian et al. (1997)
determined that the mouse Ipl gene maps to the region of chromosome 7
that is syntenic with human 11p15.5.

GENE STRUCTURE

Like several other imprinted genes, mouse and human IPL are small and
contain small introns; human IPL contains a single 223-bp intron (Qian
et al., 1997).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ishida et al. (2012) identified a 15-bp tandem repeat (GGGGCGGGGAGGGGC)
located 48 bp upstream of the PHLDA2 transcription start site. The
tandem repeat is present in 87% of chromosomes. The minor allele is a
single copy and found in the remaining 13% of chromosomes.

For discussion of a possible association between variation in this
PHLDA2 promoter variant and birth weight, see 613219.

ANIMAL MODEL

The IPL gene lies in an extended imprinted region of distal mouse
chromosome 7, which also contains the IGF2 gene. Expression of Ipl is
highest in placenta and yolk sac, where its mRNA is derived almost
entirely from the maternal allele. Ipl encodes a small cytoplasmic
protein with a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain (summary by Frank et al.,
1999). Frank et al. (2002) constructed 2 lines of mice with germline
deletions of this gene and another line deleted for the similar but
nonimprinted gene Tih1 (607054). All 3 lines were viable. There was
consistent overgrowth of the Ipl-null placentas, with expansion of the
spongiotrophoblast. These larger placentas did not confer a fetal growth
advantage; fetal size was normal or slightly decreased in Ipl nulls.
When bred into an Igf2 mutant background, the Ipl deletion partially
rescued the placental but not fetal growth deficiency. Neither fetal nor
placental growth was affected by deletion of Tih1. These results showed
a nonredundant function of Ipl in restraining placental growth. The data
further indicated that Ipl can act, at least in part, independently of
insulin-like growth factor 2 signaling. Thus, genomic imprinting
regulates multiple pathways to control placental size.

610022	TITLE *610022 MYOSIN VC; MYO5C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using EST database analysis followed by PCR amplification of human
pancreas cDNA, Rodriguez and Cheney (2002) identified a new myosin V
family member that they named MYO5C. The MYO5C gene encodes a
1,742-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 203 kD that
shares approximately 50% identity with family members MYO5A (160777) and
MYO5B (606540). The MYO5C protein consists of a motor domain followed by
6 IQ motifs, a coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal globular domain.
MYO5C contains a serine residue conserved among all 3 class V myosins
whose phosphorylation in MYO5A regulates melanosome binding; however,
MYO5C does not contain the PEST region present in MYO5A and MYO5B.
Northern and dot blot analyses showed expression of an 8.7-kb MYO5C
transcript in salivary gland, stomach, colon, pancreas, lung, thyroid,
prostate, and mammary gland. Immunolocalization in mouse tissues
detected abundant Myo5c protein expression in pancreas, colon, and
stomach. Myo5c was found specifically in the apical regions of
intestinal epithelial cells and in exocrine pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Rodriguez and Cheney (2002) demonstrated, by overexpression of a
dominant-negative MYO5C tail construct in HeLa cells, that MYO5C
colocalizes with and perturbs a membrane compartment containing the
transferrin receptor (TFRC; 190010) and RAB8 (165040). Pulse-chase
experiments showed that overexpression of MYO5C also disrupts TFRC
trafficking.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using genomic sequence analysis, Rodriguez and Cheney (2002) determined
that the MYO5C gene consists of at least 39 exons and spans more than
100 kb.

MAPPING

Rodriguez and Cheney (2002) mapped the MYO5C gene to chromosome 15q21,
immediately adjacent to MYO5A, by genomic sequence analysis.

602201	TITLE *602201 EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX PROTEIN 1; ECM1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mathieu et al. (1994) identified a novel 85-kD protein secreted by a
mouse osteogenic stromal cell line. Bhalerao et al. (1995) showed that
the full-length cDNA is 1.9 kb and contains an open reading frame of
1,677 bp that codes for a protein of 559 amino acids.

Smits et al. (1997) described a genomic clone containing the human
homolog, termed extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1), from a chromosome
1 cosmid library. The ECM1 gene appeared to be expressed as a 1.8-kb
transcript predominantly in placenta and heart, while an additional
1.4-kb alternatively spliced message was detected in tonsils. The
full-length human ECM1 transcript contains 1,838 bp and has an overall
homology of 79.6% with the mouse Ecm1 cDNA. The transcript codes for a
protein of 540 amino acids that is 69.4% identical and 81.3% similar to
the corresponding mouse protein. The alternatively spliced variant,
1,450 bp long, encodes a protein of 415 amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Smits et al. (1997) demonstrated that the coding region of the human
ECM1 gene comprises 10 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Oyama et al. (2003) noted that HLA-subtype susceptibility and high rates
of other autoimmune disorders suggest that autoantibodies to specific
mucocutaneous antigens may be involved in the etiology of lichen
sclerosis (151590). The clinicopathologic similarities between lichen
sclerosis and lipoid proteinosis, which results from mutations in ECM1,
suggested that this protein may be an autoantigen in lichen sclerosis.
By immunoblotting, IgG autoantibodies to ECM1 were found in 20 of 30
lichen sclerosis serum samples. The highest titer was 1 in 20. These
samples, and those from 56 other patients with lichen sclerosis, showed
immunoreactivity to the recombinant ECM1 protein; 6 of 85 control serum
samples were positive. The findings suggested that specific humeral
immune response to ECM1 may be involved in the etiology of lichen
sclerosis and may offer help in disease diagnosis, monitoring, and
approaches to treatment.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Smits et al. (1997) mapped the
ECM1 gene to 1q21 outside the epidermal differentiation complex region
(see 152445). Bhalerao et al. (1995) mapped the gene to mouse chromosome
3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lipoid proteinosis, also known as hyalinosis cutis et mucosae or
Urbach-Wiethe disease (247100), is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder
typified by generalized thickening of skin, mucosae, and certain
viscera. Classic features include beaded eyelid papules and laryngeal
infiltration leading to hoarseness. Histologically, there is widespread
deposition of hyaline (glycoprotein) material and
disruption/reduplication of basement membrane. Using DNA from 6
consanguineous families, Hamada et al. (2002) mapped the disorder to
chromosome 1q21 at marker D1S498 (lod = 21.85 at theta = 0), within a
2.3-cM critical region. Using a candidate gene approach, the authors
identified 6 different homozygous loss-of-function mutations in ECM1.

LIPOID PROTEINOSIS OF URBACH AND WIETHE
ECM1, 1-BP DEL, 1019A

In affected individuals of a consanguineous Kuwaiti family with lipoid
proteinosis (247100), Hamada et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for a
single-basepair deletion (A1019) in exon 7 of the ECM1 gene. The
mutation resulted in a premature stop codon 108 bp downstream.

Hamada et al. (2002) identified a 14-year old Pakistani boy with lipoid
proteinosis (247100); he was the product of a consanguineous mating, and
was homozygous for a C-to-T transition at position 1036 in exon 7 of the
ECM1 gene. The mutation resulted in conversion of codon gln346 to a
premature stop codon (Q346X).

.0003
LIPOID PROTEINOSIS OF URBACH AND WIETHE
ECM1, 1163-BP DEL

Hamada et al. (2002) reported 4 sibs affected with lipoid proteinosis
(247100) within a consanguineous Saudi family. All affected individuals
were homozygous for an 1163-bp deletion in the ECM1 gene, which
eliminated part of intron 8 and all of exons 9 and 10.

.0004

In 2 unrelated subjects with lipoid proteinosis (247100) with different
ECM1 haplotypes, Hamada et al. (2003) identified a 507delT mutation in
exon 6 of the ECM1 gene. The authors suggested that the deletion, which
causes a frameshift and premature termination 23 bp downstream, may
represent a recurrent mutation in lipoid proteinosis.

609025	TITLE *609025 KERATIN 75; KRT75
;;KERATIN 6, HAIR FOLLICLE; K6HF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of anagen hair follicle cDNA, Winter et al.
(1998) cloned K6HF. The deduced 551-amino acid protein shares about 80%
homology with cytokeratin KRT5 (148040). In situ hybridization and
indirect immunofluorescence localization showed that K6HF was expressed
exclusively in the companion layer of the hair follicle before KRT17
(148069) and KRT16 (148067).

Wojcik et al. (2001) cloned mouse K6hf. The deduced 551-amino acid
protein shares 84.8% identity with human K6HF.

GENE FUNCTION

Wojcik et al. (2001) found that K6hf assembled into a keratin network
following transfection of kangaroo rat kidney epithelial cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rogers et al. (2000) determined that the K6HF gene spans 17.4 kb.

MAPPING

By screening an arrayed PAC DNA library, Rogers et al. (2000) mapped the
K6HF gene to a region of chromosome 12q13 that flanks a series of hair
keratin genes and pseudogenes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Winter et al. (2004) identified a nonsynonymous SNP in the KRT75 gene
(A12T; 609025.0001) that was significantly associated with the
development of pseudofolliculitis barbae (612318).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PSEUDOFOLLICULITIS BARBAE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
KRT75, ALA12THR

In 2 affected members of a Caucasian family with pseudofolliculitis
barbae (612318), Winter et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous G-to-A
transition in the KRT75 gene, resulting in an ala12-to-thr (A12T)
substitution in the 1A alpha-helical subdomain of KRT75. The mutation
was also present in an unaffected female relative who had straight hair
and did not shave regularly. In a larger group of 200 individuals,
Winter et al. (2004) found that the A12T SNP was present in 9% of
individuals without the disorder and 35% with the disorder, which was a
significant association (p less than 6 x 10(-6)). The incidence of the
A12T substitution in the investigated population was approximately 3
times higher in African Americans compared to Caucasians (36.7% vs
10.9%). Computer modeling showed that the A12T substitution occurred in
an external position on the surface of the coiled-coil domain and did
not affected the ability of alpha-helical structures to assemble in
parallel. However, in vitro expression studies showed that the variant
was disruptive at later stages, compromising the aggregation of keratin
molecules into intermediate filaments. Winter et al. (2004) postulated
that the A12T SNP destabilizes the mechanical integrity of companion
cells in the hair shaft, which may compromise the ability of the shaft
to move within the skin surface.

608420	TITLE *608420 PANNEXIN 1; PANX1
;;PX1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Bruzzone et al. (2003) cloned Panx1 from a rat hippocampus cDNA library.
The deduced 48-kD protein contains 4 transmembrane domains and
cytoplasmic N and C termini. Northern blot analysis detected Panx1
expression in rat eye, thyroid, prostate, kidney, liver, and central
nervous system. In situ hybridization showed Pnx1 expression in several
brain regions, including cortex, striatum, olfactory bulb, hippocampus,
thalamus, and cerebellum.

GENE FUNCTION

By functional expression in Xenopus oocytes, Bruzzone et al. (2003)
found that rat Pnx1 could support large, voltage-activated outward
currents. With coexpression of rat Panx2 (608421), the Panx1 currents
were reduced. In paired oocytes, Panx1 induced the formation of
intercellular channels with characteristics of gap junctions.

Erythrocytes do not form gap junctions, but Locovei et al. (2006) found
that human erythrocytes expressed pannexin-1. Pannexin-1 formed
mechanosensitive ATP-permeable channels in erythrocytes, and ATP release
by erythrocytes was attenuated by a gap junction blocker. Under
conditions of ATP release, erythrocytes took up tracer molecules
permeant to gap junction channels.

Thompson et al. (2008) noted that PANX1 is expressed at postsynaptic
sites in pyramidal neurons, suggesting that these hemichannels
contribute to dendritic signals associated with synaptic function. The
authors found that, in pyramidal neurons, NMDAR (138249) activation
induced a secondary prolonged current and dye efflux that were blocked
with a specific inhibitory peptide against PANX1 hemichannels. Knockdown
of PANX1 by RNA interference blocked the secondary current in cultured
neurons. Enhancing endogenous NMDAR activation in brain slices by
removing external magnesium ions triggered epileptiform activity, which
had decreased spike amplitude and prolonged interburst interval during
application of the PANX1-blocking peptide. Thompson et al. (2008)
concluded that PANX1 hemichannel opening is triggered by NMDAR
stimulation and can contribute to epileptiform seizure activity.

Apoptotic cells release 'find-me' signals at the earliest stages of
death to recruit phagocytes. Chekeni et al. (2010) identified the plasma
membrane channel PANX1 as a mediator of find-me signal/nucleotide
release from apoptotic cells. Pharmacologic inhibition and
siRNA-mediated knockdown of PANX1 led to decreased nucleotide release
and monocyte recruitment by apoptotic cells. Conversely, PANX1
overexpression enhanced nucleotide release from apoptotic cells and
phagocyte recruitment. Patch-clamp recordings showed that PANX1 was
basally inactive, and that induction of PANX1 currents occurred only
during apoptosis. Mechanistically, PANX1 itself was a target of the
effector caspases CASP3 (600636) and CASP7 (601761), and a specific
caspase cleavage site within PANX1 was essential for PANX1 function
during apoptosis. Expression of truncated PANX1 (at the putative caspase
cleavage site) resulted in a constitutively open channel. PANX1 was also
important for the 'selective' plasma membrane permeability of early
apoptotic cells to specific dyes. Collectively, Chekeni et al. (2010)
concluded that their data identified PANX1 as a plasma membrane channel
mediating the regulated release of find-me signals and selective plasma
membrane permeability during apoptosis, and a novel mechanism of PANX1
activation by caspases.

Karatas et al. (2013) described a signaling pathway between stressed
neurons and trigeminal afferents during cortical spreading depression
(CSD), the putative cause of migraine aura and headache (see 157300).
CSD caused neuronal PANX1 megachannel opening and CASP1 (147678)
activation followed by high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1; 163905) release
from neurons and nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011) activation in
astrocytes. Suppression of this cascade abolished CSD-induced
trigeminovascular activation, dural mast cell degranulation, and
headache. CSD-induced neuronal megachannel opening may promote sustained
activation of trigeminal afferents via parenchymal inflammatory cascades
reaching glia limitans. Karatas et al. (2013) suggested that this
pathway may function to alarm an organism with headache when neurons are
stressed.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PANX1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP RH11012).

605117	TITLE *605117 SUPPRESSOR OF CYTOKINE SIGNALING 2; SOCS2
;;STAT-INDUCED STAT INHIBITOR 2; SSI2; STATI2;;
CYTOKINE-INDUCIBLE SH2 PROTEIN 2; CIS2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SOCS proteins, such as SOCS2, negatively regulate cytokine receptor
signaling via the Janus kinase (see 147795)/signal transducer and
activation of transcription (STAT; see 600555) pathway (the JAK/STAT
pathway) (Minamoto et al., 1997).

CLONING

By a computer-aided homology search of sequence databases, Minamoto et
al. (1997) identified a partial sequence of SSI2, a member of the SSI
(STAT-induced STAT inhibitor) gene family. They isolated an SSI2 cDNA
from a Jurkat cDNA library. SSI2 encodes a protein of 198 amino acids.
The deduced amino acid sequences of human SSI2 and SSI3 (604176) share
significant homology with human and mouse SSI1 (SOCS1; 603597) and mouse
Cis (602441) at the C-terminal region as well as in the SH2 domain.
Northern blot analysis revealed strong expression of SSI2 in heart,
placenta, lung, kidney, and prostate.

On the basis of an EST database search, Masuhara et al. (1997)
identified SOCS2, which they called CIS2. They found that a C-terminal
40-amino acid region, designated the CIS homology (CH) domain, and the
SH2 domain are highly conserved in the CIS genes, while the respective
N-terminal regions of these proteins share little similarity.

Dey et al. (1998) identified SOCS2 based on its interaction with the
cytoplasmic domain of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF1R;
147370) in a yeast 2-hybrid screen. They cloned a full-length SOCS2 cDNA
by 5-prime RACE PCR of a human fetal brain cDNA library. Northern blot
analysis demonstrated expression of SOCS2 in many human fetal and adult
tissues, with particular abundance in fetal kidney and adult heart,
skeletal muscle, pancreas, and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Minamoto et al. (1997) found that SSI2 expression was induced by
cytokine stimulation, and its forced expression in the mouse myeloid
leukemia cell line M1 suppressed the apoptotic affects of LIF (159540)
similarly to SSI1.

Dey et al. (1998) found that the human SOCS2 protein interacted strongly
with the activated IGF1R and not with a kinase-negative mutant receptor
in yeast 2-hybrid assays. Mutation of receptor tyrosines 950, 1250,
1251, and 1316 to phenylalanine or deletion of the C-terminal 93 amino
acids did not result in decreased interaction of the receptor with human
SOCS2 protein. SOCS2 interacted with IGF1R both in vitro and in vivo.
Dey et al. (1998) concluded that their results raised the possibility
that SOCS proteins may play a regulatory role in IGF1 receptor
signaling.

Machado et al. (2006) showed that lipoxin A4 (LXA4) activated 2
receptors in mouse splenic dendritic cells, Ahr (600253) and Lxar
(FPRL1; 136538), and that this activation triggered Socs2.
Socs2-deficient mouse dendritic cells were hyperresponsive to microbial
stimuli and were refractory to the inhibitory action of LXA4, but not
Il10 (124092). Upon infection with an intracellular pathogen,
Socs2-deficient mice had uncontrolled production of proinflammatory
cytokines, decreased microbial proliferation, aberrant leukocyte
infiltration, and elevated mortality. Machado et al. (2006) also showed
that Socs2 was a crucial intracellular mediator of the antiinflammatory
actions of aspirin-induced lipoxins in vivo.

GENE STRUCTURE

Metcalf et al. (2000) demonstrated that the mouse SOCS2 gene is composed
of 3 exons and 2 introns.

MAPPING

By cytogenetic and radiation hybrid mapping, Yandava et al. (1999)
mapped the SOCS2 gene to chromosome 12q21.3-q23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kato et al. (2006) performed a region-wide association analysis on
12q15-q22 using more than 500 SNPs in 1,492 unrelated Japanese
individuals and identified an association between type II diabetes
(125853) and a 13.6-kb haplotype block that includes the entire SOCS2
gene. Five SNPs in the 5-prime region of the SOCS2 gene were
significantly associated with type II diabetes. Kato et al. (2006)
concluded that SOCS2 may play a role in susceptibility to type II
diabetes in the Japanese.

ANIMAL MODEL

Metcalf et al. (2000) generated mice deficient in Socs2 by targeted
disruption. Socs2-deficient mice were indistinguishable from their
littermates until weaning at 3 weeks of age, but subsequently grew more
rapidly. Socs2 -/- adult males were on average 40% heavier than wildtype
littermates. Adult Socs2 +/- males exhibited an intermediate body
weight. Increased growth was also significant but less marked in female
Socs2 -/- mice. Adult Socs2 -/- females typically attained the weight of
wildtype male mice, but heterozygous Socs2 females were not
significantly heavier than sex-matched wildtype littermates. Neither
male nor female Socs2 -/- mice accumulated significantly more fatty
tissue than wildtype mice. Rather, increased body weight in these mice
resulted from an increase in the weight of most visceral organs.
Sexually dimorphic or male-specific organs were not disproportionately
enlarged. Carcass weight was also significantly increased, indicating
that muscle and bone may contribute significantly to the increased size
of Socs2-deficient mice. There was significant increase in long bone
length. Tail length was normal. The increase in size was due to elevated
cell numbers rather than increased cell size. Metcalf et al. (2000)
observed a marked thickening of the dermis associated with excessive
collagen accumulation in all of 7 males, and less prominently in 6 of 8
female Socs2 -/- mice. Collagen deposition was also increased around the
bronchi and vessels of the lungs of 6 of the 9 male, but only 3 of 10
female, Socs2-deficient mice. No hematologic abnormalities were
observed. The characteristics of Socs2 -/- mice were similar to those of
mice with growth hormone (GH; 139250) excess and IGF1 (147440) excess.
Characteristics of deregulated growth hormone and IGF1 signaling,
including decreased production of major urinary protein, increased local
IGF1 production, and collagen accumulation in the dermis were observed
in Socs2-deficient mice, indicating that Socs2 may have an essential
negative regulatory role in the growth hormone/IGF1 pathway.

Turnley et al. (2002) studied the role of Socs2 in mouse neural
development. They found that Socs2 was expressed by mouse progenitor
cells and neurons in response to LIF-like cytokines. Progenitor cells
lacking Socs2 produced fewer neurons and more astrocytes in vitro. Socs2
-/- mice had fewer neurons and neurogenin-1 (NGN1; 601726)-expressing
cells in the developing cortex, whereas overexpression of Socs2
increased neuronal differentiation. Turnley et al. (2002) found that GH
inhibited Ngn1 expression and neuronal production, and this action was
blocked by Socs2 overexpression. They speculated that Socs2 promotes
neuronal differentiation by blocking GH-mediated downregulation of Ngn1.

Using GH-deficient Socs2 -/- mice, Greenhalgh et al. (2005) demonstrated
that the Socs2 -/- phenotype is dependent upon the presence of
endogenous GH. Treatment with exogenous GH induced excessive growth in
terms of overall body weight, body and bone lengths, and the weight of
internal organs and tissues. Microarray analysis on liver RNA extracts
after exogenous GH administration revealed a heightened response to GH.
The conserved C-terminal SOCS-box motif was essential for all inhibitory
function. SOCS2 was found to bind 2 phosphorylated tyrosines on the GH
receptor (600946), and mutation analysis of these amino acids showed
that both were essential for SOCS2 function. Greenhalgh et al. (2005)
concluded that SOCS2 is a negative regulator of GH signaling.

177070	TITLE *177070 PROTEIN 4.2, ERYTHROCYTIC; EPB42
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Korsgren et al. (1990) cloned and sequenced protein band 4.2 from a
human reticulocyte cDNA library. The deduced 691-amino acid band 4.2
protein has homology with 2 closely related calcium-dependent
crosslinking proteins, guinea pig liver transglutaminase and the alpha
subunit of human coagulation factor XIII (F13A1; 134570). Within the 5
contiguous consensus residues of the transglutaminase active site, band
4.2 has an amino acid substitution which leads to loss of
transglutaminase activity. Sung et al. (1990) also cloned protein 4.2
and likewise found homology to the 2 transglutaminases, as well as the
lack of the critical residue required for enzymatic crosslinking of
substrates.

Korsgren and Cohen (1991) showed that reticulocytes contain 2 different
sized EPB42 messages; the major, smaller, message is produced by
alternative splicing. They found that the human and murine proteins
share 72% sequence identity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Korsgren and Cohen (1991) showed that the band 4.2 gene is about 20 kb
long and contains 13 exons. Alignment of the band 4.2 amino acid
sequence with that of F13A2 and division of the sequences into exons
showed a remarkable correspondence, and in most cases identity, in the
sizes of the paired exons.

Korsgren and Cohen (1994) found that the organization and size of the
human and mouse EPB42 genes are identical.

MAPPING

Sung et al. (1991) mapped the EPB42 gene to 15q15-q21 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization. Najfeld et al. (1992) assigned the gene to 15q15 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. White et al. (1992) mapped the Epb42
gene to mouse chromosome 2, which shares an extensive segment of
syntenic homology with human chromosome 15.

By long-range genomic PCR, Grenard et al. (2001) mapped the EPB42 gene
to a 100-kb region of 15q15.2, arranged in tandem with 2 other
transglutaminase genes, TGM5 (603805) and TGM7 (606776). By radiation
hybrid analysis, Grenard et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Epb42, Tgm5, and
Tgm7 genes in close proximity on chromosome 2.

GENE FUNCTION

In the red cell membrane skeleton, protein 4.2 may regulate the
association of protein 3 (109270) with ankyrin (612641) (Davies and Lux,
1989).

Azim et al. (1996) demonstrated that both protein 4.2 and dematin
(125305) are ATP-binding proteins.

Bruce et al. (2002) observed that protein 4.2 and CD47 interact in the
human red cell membrane, which provided further evidence for an
association between the band 3 complex (which includes protein 4.2) and
the Rh complex, and defined a point of attachment between the Rh complex
and the red cell cytoskeleton.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 4 unrelated Japanese patients with autosomal recessive hereditary
spherocytosis (612690), Bouhassira et al. (1991, 1992) identified
homozygosity for a mutation in the EPB42 gene (177070.0001).

In a Portuguese woman with recessively transmitted hemolytic anemia,
Hayette et al. (1995) identified a mutation in the EPB42 gene
(177070.0002).

In Tunisian sibs with autosomal recessive hemolytic anemia reported by
Ghanem et al. (1990), Hayette et al. (1995) identified homozygosity for
a mutation in the EPB42 gene (177070.0003).

ANIMAL MODEL

The mouse 'pallid' mutation (see 604310) produces defects in at least 3
subcellular organelles: platelet-dense granules, melanosomes, and kidney
lysosomes. White et al. (1992) noted that the mouse Epb42 gene mapped to
the same region as the pallid mutation in the mouse. Prompted to examine
the Epb42 gene in the pallid mouse, they found changes on Southern blot
analysis suggesting a mutation; Northern blot analysis demonstrated
smaller than normal Epb42 transcripts in affected pallid tissues, such
as kidney and skin. However, Gwynn et al. (1997) and White et al. (1997)
excluded Epb42 as a candidate for the mouse pallid mutation. On Northern
blot analysis of normal and pallid mouse kidney, Gwynn et al. (1997)
observed that the truncated Epb42 protein comigrated with normal Epb42
protein. As the pallid mutation originally arose in a wild M. domesticus
mouse, they concluded that the Epb42 protein characteristic of pallid is
a normal polymorphism and that Epb42 and pallid are distinct loci.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPHEROCYTOSIS, TYPE 5, DUE TO PROTEIN 4.2-NIPPON
EPB42, ALA142THR

In 4 unrelated Japanese patients with spherocytosis (612690), Bouhassira
et al. (1991, 1992) identified homozygosity for a G-to-A transition in
the EPB42 gene, resulting in an ala142-to-thr (A142T) substitution. The
abnormality in protein 4.2 results in abnormally shaped and osmotically
fragile RBCs. The mutation occurred in an alternatively spliced exon
that is present in 2 of 4 EPB42 mRNA splicing isoforms. Thus this is a
recessive form of spherocytosis causing hereditary hemolytic anemia.

Iwamoto et al. (1993) identified the same mutation in a 27-year-old
Japanese female with acute hemolytic crisis and in her sister.

Perrotta et al. (1999) described the 4.2-Nippon mutation in a
30-year-old female born in a small mountain village in central Italy.
There was no Japanese ancestry. Splenomegaly and moderate hemolytic
anemia were present from birth.

.0002
SPHEROCYTOSIS, TYPE 5, DUE TO PROTEIN 4.2-LISBOA
EPB42, 1-BP DEL, 264G

Hayette et al. (1995) identified a defect in the EPB42 gene in a
26-year-old Portuguese woman with recessively transmitted hereditary
hemolytic anemia (612690). Protein 4.2 was absent from red cell ghosts
by Western blotting. Nucleotide sequencing disclosed deletion of a
single nucleotide at position 264 (or 265): AAG GTG was changed to AAG
TG in codon 88 (or 89) in exon 2. This change, defining allele 4.2
Lisboa, placed in frame the nonsense TGA triplet that normally overlaps
codons 136 and 137 (GTG ACC). In effect, codon 89 was changed from GTG
(val) to TGA (stop). The mutation was present in homozygous state in the
proband and in heterozygous state in the parents and a brother. Apart
from anemia, the patient was free of clinical manifestations. Hayette et
al. (1995) noted that in this case there were only a few spherocytes and
only a limited decrease in the osmotic resistance.

.0003
SPHEROCYTOSIS, TYPE 5, DUE TO PROTEIN 4.2-TOZEUR
EPB42, ARG310GLN

Using high-sensitivity Western blot analysis, Hayette et al. (1995)
found that the Tunisian sibs with autosomal recessive hemolytic anemia
(612690) originally reported by Ghanem et al. (1990) had trace amounts
of the EPB42 protein. They found that the sibs were homozygous for a
G-to-A transition in exon 7 of the EPB42 gene, resulting in an
arg310-to-gln (R310Q) substitution. The parents were heterozygous for
the mutation, which was absent in 48 control chromosomes of Tunisian
individuals.

.0004
SPHEROCYTOSIS, TYPE 5, DUE TO PROTEIN 4.2-NOTAME
EPB42, IVS6DS, G-A, +1

Protein 4.2 (Notame) was found in a 56-year-old Japanese man being
investigated for chronic hyperbilirubinemia (Matsuda et al., 1995). He
had mild splenomegaly and mild anemia with reticulocytosis as well as
microspherocytosis (612690). Erythrocyte osmotic fragility was
remarkably increased. SDS-PAGE showed complete deficiency of protein
4.2. Direct sequencing and dot-blot hybridization with allele-specific
oligonucleotide probes indicated that the man was a compound
heterozygote for the A142T mutation (177070.0001) and a single
nucleotide substitution (G to A) in the first nucleotide of intron 6 of
the EPB42 gene. RT-PCR analysis using total RNA isolated from
reticulocytes of the proband showed that the intron 6 donor site
mutation caused exon 6 to be spliced out with intron 6. The abnormal
mRNA had a premature termination codon as a result of a frameshift,
which precipitated instability of the protein that led to its
degradation.

.0005
SPHEROCYTOSIS, TYPE 5, DUE TO PROTEIN 4.2-HAMMERSMITH
EPB42, 41-BP DEL, NT1709

Bruce et al. (2002) presented data on a patient of Pakistani origin with
recessive spherocytosis due to absence of protein 4.2 (612690). EPB42
cDNA sequence analysis showed the presence of a 41-bp frameshift
deletion in the 5-prime end of exon 11 of the EPB42 gene that produced a
truncated peptide designated protein 4.2 Hammersmith. Quantitative
RT-PCR indicated that the mutant mRNA was unstable. Sequencing of
genomic DNA showed that the deletion stemmed from aberrant splicing. The
proband was homozygous for a G-to-T substitution at position 1747 that
activated a cryptic acceptor splice site within exon 11 of the EPB42
gene. The proband's mother was heterozygous for this substitution.
Unlike protein 4.2-null mice, the proband's red cells showed no evidence
of abnormal cation permeability. Quantitation of red cell membrane
proteins showed that CD47 (601028) was markedly reduced to about 1% (in
the proband) and 65% (in the mother) of that found in healthy controls.

609827	TITLE *609827 PELLINO, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 3; PELI3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Toll-like receptors (TLRs; see 603030) and IL1R (IL1R1; 147810) are part
of the innate immune response aimed at mobilizing defense mechanisms in
response in infection or injury. Pellino proteins, such as PELI3, are
intermediate components in the signaling cascades initiated by TLRs and
IL1R (Jensen and Whitehead, 2003).

CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to PELI1 (614797) and PELI2 (614798),
followed by 3-prime RACE, Jensen and Whitehead (2003) cloned 2 splice
variants of PELI3, which they called PELI3-alpha and PELI3-beta. The
deduced 469-amino acid PELI3-alpha protein contains 24 amino acids
encoded by exon 3 that are absent in the 445-amino acid PELI3-beta
protein. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.5-kb transcript expressed
at high levels in brain, heart, and testis, and at lower levels in
kidney, liver, lung, placenta, small intestine, spleen, and stomach.
RT-PCR, but not Northern blot analysis, also showed PELI3 expression in
muscle and colon.

GENE FUNCTION

Jensen and Whitehead (2003) found that PELI3 interacted directly with
IL1R-associated kinase-1 (IRAK1; 300283), TNF receptor-associated
factor-6 (TRAF6; 602355), TNF-beta-activated kinase-1 (TAK1, or MAP3K7;
602614), and NFKB-inducing kinase (NIK, or MAP3K14; 604655) in an IL1
(see IL1A; 147760)-dependent manner. In reporter gene assays, PELI3
activated JUN (165160) and ELK1 (311040), but not NFKB (see 164011).
Jensen and Whitehead (2003) concluded that PELI3 plays a role in the
innate immune response and may be a scaffolding protein.

Butler et al. (2005) found that both isoforms of PELI3 could induce
expression of a reporter gene dependent on p38 MAPK (MAPK14; 600289)
activation in human embryonic kidney cells. Activation of p38 MAPK by
PELI3 coincided with binding of PELI3 to IRAK1. TRAF6 and TAK1 were
identified as downstream mediators of p38 MAPK activation by PELI3.
PELI3 promoted translocation of the p38 MAPK substrate, MAPK-activated
protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK2; 602006), from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
and activated the transcription factor CREB (123810) in a p38
MAPK-dependent manner.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jensen and Whitehead (2003) determined that the PELI3 gene contains 8
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Jensen and Whitehead (2003) mapped the
PELI3 gene to chromosome 11.

610602	TITLE *610602 AlkB, E. COLI, HOMOLOG OF, 2; ALKBH2
;;ABH2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Escherichia coli AlkB protein protects against the cytotoxicity of
methylating agents by repair of the specific DNA lesions generated in
single-stranded DNA. ALKBH2 and ALKBH3 (610603) are E. coli AlkB
homologs that catalyze the removal of 1-methyladenine and
3-methylcytosine (Duncan et al., 2002).

CLONING

By searching human genomic and cDNA databases with ALKBH1 (605345) as
query, Duncan et al. (2002) obtained a full-length cDNA of ALKBH2. The
deduced protein shares 30.8% amino acid identity over the core region
with E. coli AlkB and shares similarity to
alpha-ketoglutarate/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases in the C-terminal
region. Northern blot analysis detected ALKBH2 expression in all tissues
examined, as well as several carcinoma cell lines, with highest
expression in liver and bladder. Immunofluorescence studies localized
ALKBH2 to the nucleus with a diffuse pattern throughout the nucleoplasm
and accumulation in the nucleoli.

By PCR of a testis cDNA library, Tsujikawa et al. (2007) cloned
full-length ABH2 and an ABH2 splice variant. The deduced full-length
261-amino acid protein has a C-terminal AlkB homology domain that is
predicted to function as a 2-oxoglutarate- and Fe(II)-dependent
oxygenase domain. The ABH2 splice variant lacks exon 3 and encodes a
157-amino acid isoform lacking the AlkB homology domain due to a
frameshift. Quantitative real-time PCR detected variable ABH2 expression
in all 16 tissues examined, with highest expression in testis.
Fluorescence-tagged full-length ABH2 was expressed in nuclei of
transfected HeLa cells, with particularly bright nucleolar staining. The
ABH2 splice variant was more diffusely expressed in nuclei and
cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Using purified GST- and histidine-tagged ALKBH2 overexpressed in E.
coli, Duncan et al. (2002) showed that ALKBH2 catalyzed the removal of
both 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine from methylated
polynucleotides with 4-fold greater activity on 1-methyladenine than on
3-methylcytosine. ALKBH2 partially reverted 3-methylcytosine to cytosine
and repaired ethylated DNA bases through a mechanism similar to E. coli
AlkB activity.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Yang et al. (2008) demonstrated the first crystal structures of
AlkB-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and ABH2-dsDNA complexes, stabilized by
a chemical crosslinking strategy. This study revealed that AlkB uses an
unprecedented base-flipping mechanism to access the damaged base: it
squeezes together the 2 bases flanking the flipped-out one to maintain
the base stack, explaining the preference of AlkB for repairing
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) lesions over dsDNA ones. In addition, the
first crystal structure of ABH2 provided a structural basis for
designing inhibitors of this human DNA repair protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsujikawa et al. (2007) determined that the ALKBH2 gene contains at
least 4 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Duncan et al. (2002) mapped the ALKBH2
gene to chromosome 12q23.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ringvoll et al. (2006) generated mice with targeted disruption of Abh2,
Abh3 (ALKBH3; 610603), and Abh2/Abh3 double-knockout mice. Both single-
and double-knockout mice were viable and appeared normal into adulthood.
Using genomic DNA isolated from liver samples, the authors showed that
Abh2-null mice displayed an increased accumulation of 1-methyladenine
compared to wildtype and Abh3-null mice. Embryonic fibroblasts derived
from Abh2-null mice exhibited a decreased ability to remove methyl
methane sulfate (MMS)-induced 1-methyladenine from genomic DNA compared
to fibroblasts derived from both wildtype and Abh3-null mice. Ringvoll
et al. (2006) concluded that Abh2 is the primary oxidative demethylase
for repair of 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine in double-stranded
DNA, and that Abh2 and Abh3 have different roles in repair of DNA damage
caused by alkylating agents.

601176	TITLE *601176 GLUTAMATE-CYSTEINE LIGASE, MODIFIER SUBUNIT; GCLM
;;GLUTAMATE-CYSTEINE LIGASE, REGULATORY; GLCLR;;
GAMMA-GLUTAMYLCYSTEINE SYNTHETASE, REGULATORY SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, also known as glutamate-cysteine
ligase (EC 6.3.2.2), is the first rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione
biosynthesis.

CLONING

Human liver gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase consists of 2 subunits: a
heavy catalytic subunit (GCLC; 606857) and a light regulatory subunit.
Gipp et al. (1995) reported the cloning of a full-length cDNA for the
light subunit. The cDNA encodes a 274-amino acid protein of
approximately 30.7 kD that is 96% identical to the previously cloned rat
sequence (Huang et al., 1993). Northern blot analysis detected 1.4- and
4.1-kb transcripts in several tissue types. The smaller transcript was
detected in the colon, whereas both forms were found in skeletal muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rozet et al. (1998) determined that the GLCLR gene encompasses 22 kb and
contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Tsuchiya et al. (1995)
mapped the human GLCLR gene to 1p22-p21 and the mouse gene to 3H1-3. By
Southern blot analysis of DNA from a panel of somatic cell hybrids,
Sierra-Rivera et al. (1996) assigned GLCLR to chromosome 1;
sublocalization to 1p21 was achieved by FISH.

Rozet et al. (1998) found an EST of GLCLR within a YAC contig
encompassing the critically deleted region of human malignant
mesothelioma, between loci D1S435 and D1S236. They refined the physical
mapping of GLCLR to 1p22.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Nakamura et al. (2002) reported an association between a polymorphism in
the GCLM gene (601176.0001) and myocardial infarction (608446).

Schizophrenia (181500) is a major and frequent chronic psychiatric
disorder with a strong genetic component. Converging evidence points to
the involvement of oxidative stress and N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptor (138249) hypofunction in the pathophysiology of the disease. As
a main cellular nonprotein antioxidant and redox regulator, glutathione
(GSH) plays a major role in protecting nervous tissue against reactive
oxygen species and in modulating redox-sensitive sites, including NMDA
receptors (NMDA-R). Tosic et al. (2006) noted that studies had found GSH
levels to be decreased in patients' cerebrospinal fluid, in medial
prefrontal cortex in vivo, and in striatum postmortem tissue.
GSH-deficient models revealed morphologic, electrophysiologic, and
behavioral anomalies similar to those observed in patients. Tosic et al.
(2006) found an association between schizophrenia and the gene of the
key GSH-synthesizing enzyme, GCLM. A functional role of the GCLM gene
variance in schizophrenia was supported by its low expression in
patients' fibroblasts and by the decreased stimulation of the enzyme
activity when challenged by an oxidative stress. The findings were
considered consistent with the concept that an abnormal GSH metabolism
is a factor for schizophrenia. One of the case-control studies was
conducted in Switzerland and the other in Denmark. Two particular
combinations of variation at 3 SNPs related to the GCLM gene, TT/GG/TC
and CC/GG/TT, had odds ratios of 4.89 and 4.17, respectively. Tosic et
al. (2006) observed that the GCLM gene is localized on 1p21, a region
shown by previous linkage studies to be one of the several critical for
schizophrenia (Pulver et al., 2000, Arinami et al., 2005).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
GCLM, -588C-T

In Japanese patients with myocardial infarction (608446), Nakamura et
al. (2002) searched for common variants in the 5-prime flanking region
of the GCLM gene and identified a -588C-T polymorphism in which the T
allele showed lower promoter activity (40 to 50% of that of the C
allele) in response to oxidants. Analyzing 429 patients with MI and 428
controls, the authors found that the frequency of the T polymorphism was
significantly higher in the MI group than in the control group (p less
than 0.001). In multiple logistic regression analysis, the T
polymorphism was a risk factor for MI independent of traditional
coronary artery disease risk factors (OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.38-2.83, p
less than 0.001). Nakamura et al. (2002) suggested that the -588T
polymorphism may suppress oxidant induction of the GCLM gene and that it
is a risk factor for MI.

Nakamura et al. (2003) examined the effects of the -588C-T polymorphism
on coronary arterial diameter and blood flow responses to intracoronary
infusion of acetylcholine in 157 consecutive patients with normal
coronary angiograms. In multivariate linear regression analysis with
covariates including traditional risk factors, the minor -588T allele
had an independent association with impaired dilation of epicardial
coronary arteries in response to acetylcholine (p less than 0.001), and
it was independently associated with a blunted increase in coronary flow
response to acetylcholine (p less than 0.01). In a subgroup of 59
consecutive patients, constrictor responses to intracoronary infusion of
NG-monomethyl-L-arginine monoacetate, had an inverse and independent
association with the -558T allele in multivariate analysis (p less than
0.01). Nakamura et al. (2003) concluded that the -588T polymorphism
causes a decrease in endothelial nitric oxide bioactivity, leading to
impairment of endothelium-dependent vasomotor function in large and
resistance coronary arteries.

611017	TITLE *611017 TRYPSIN DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; TYSND1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

All peroxisomal proteins are synthesized in the cytosol, and 2 distinct
peroxisomal targeting signals (PTSs), the C-terminal PTS1 and N-terminal
PTS2, are used for transport of these proteins into peroxisomes.
Proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal targeting sequence of PTS2
proteins accompanies import into peroxisomes, and many PTS1 proteins
undergo C-terminal processing once in the peroxisomal matrix. TYSND1
processes both PTS1 and PTS2 proteins involved in beta-oxidation of
fatty acids (Kurochkin et al., 2007).

CLONING

By database analysis, Kurochkin et al. (2005) identified mouse Tysnd1
and its rat and human homologs. The mouse Tysnd1 protein has a PTS1
motif and 2 protease-related domains.

Kurochkin et al. (2007) stated that mouse Tysnd1 contains 568 amino
acids and has 2 trypsin-like serine and cysteine peptidase domains.
Western blot analysis of transfected COS-7 cells revealed a 59-kD
protein corresponding to full-length recombinant Tysnd1 and a 49-kD
protein representing the processed form. Fractionation of rat liver
homogenate and Western blot analysis showed that endogenous Tysnd1 was
synthesized as a 59-kD protein and converted to 49- and 27-kD forms
following import into peroxisomes. Confocal microscopy localized Tysnd1
to peroxisomes of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Kurochkin et al. (2007) showed that mouse Tysnd1 processed the
PTS2-containing peroxisomal precursor 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase
(prethiolase, or ACAA1; 604054) and several PTS1-containing peroxisomal
enzymes, including peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX1; 609751), to
their mature forms in transfected COS-7 cells. Small interfering
RNA-mediated downregulation of TYSND1 in human embryonic kidney cells
blocked processing of these peroxisomal enzymes. Additional studies
showed that Tysnd1 directly processed peroxisomal enzymes in vitro,
including prethiolase, which it cleaved between cys26 and ser27 to
produce the mature form observed in vivo. Tysnd1 processing activity was
abolished by N-ethylmaleimide, an inhibitor of cysteine proteinases.
Kurochkin et al. (2007) determined that Tysnd1 itself is cleaved between
cys110 and ala111, presumably removing an inhibitory N-terminal
fragment.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TYSND1
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP D10S1466).

607349	TITLE *607349 TALIN 2; TLN2
;;KIAA0320
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomly sequencing clones from a brain cDNA library, Nagase et al.
(1997) obtained a partial cDNA encoding TLN2, which they called
KIAA0320. RT-PCR detected expression in heart, brain, kidney, thymus,
testis, and small intestine.

Using genomic and cDNA/EST sequences, Monkley et al. (2001) assembled
the complete coding sequence for TLN2. The deduced 2,532-amino acid
protein contains a FERM domain. In TLN1 (186745), the FERM domain binds
the cytodomains of beta-1 (135630) and beta-3 (173470) integrins, as
well as to F-actin (see 102610) and other proteins. TLN2 shares 74%
identity with TLN1, and the N- and C-terminal regions of TLN2 are highly
conserved across species. Analysis of EST databases indicated that both
TLN1 and TLN2 are expressed in brain, lung, heart, eye, mammary gland,
colon, stomach, lymphocytes, germ cells, liver, spleen, bone, and many
tumors. Northern blot analysis of adult mouse tissues revealed multiple
Tln2 transcripts, with highest expression in heart and undetectable
expression in spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

DiPaolo et al. (2002) and Ling et al. (2002) presented evidence that
talin, through its FERM domain, interacts with the C-terminal tail of
the 90-kD PIP5K1C (606102) isoform. DiPaolo et al. (2002) determined
that, in rat brain, the predominant talin that interacts with PIP5K1C is
Tln2. The authors showed that this interaction induces clustering of
PIP5D1C and talin at focal adhesions and increases the local production
of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Monkley et al. (2001) determined that the TLN2 gene contains 55 exons
and spans about 190 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the TLN2 gene
to chromosome 15. By genomic sequence analysis, Monkley et al. (2001)
mapped the TLN2 gene to chromosome 15q15-q21.

603601	TITLE *603601 PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3-KINASE, CLASS 2, ALPHA; PIK3C2A
;;C2-CONTAINING PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL KINASE; CPK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) phosphorylate the 3-prime OH
position of the inositol ring of inositol lipids. See 602838.

CLONING

Molz et al. (1996) cloned Drosophila and mouse homologs of a novel PI3K
that they termed Cpk. Cpk contains a C-terminal calcium-binding and
phospholipid-binding module known as the C2 domain. Domin et al. (1997)
cloned human PI3KC2-alpha, the human ortholog of Cpk. The cDNA sequence
predicts a 1,686-amino acid protein that is 90% identical to mouse Cpk.
Northern blot analysis revealed that PIK3C2A is expressed as an 8-kb
mRNA in a wide variety of tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Domin et al. (1997) determined that the PIK3C2A enzyme can phosphorylate
phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate in vitro.

Posor et al. (2013) showed that formation of
phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) by PI3KC2A
spatiotemporally controls clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Depletion of
PI(3,4)P2 or PI3KC2A impairs the maturation of late-stage
clathrin-coated pits before fission. Timed formation of PI(3,4)P2 by
PI3KC2A is required for selective enrichment of the BAR domain protein
SNX9 (605952) at late-stage endocytic intermediates. Posor et al. (2013)
concluded that their findings provided a mechanistic framework for the
role of PI(3,4)P2 in endocytosis and unraveled a novel discrete function
of PI(3,4)P2 in the central cell physiologic process of
clatherin-mediated endocytosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

By sequence analysis, Caldwell et al. (2001) determined that the PIK3C2A
gene contains 32 exons and spans approximately 76 kb.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Caldwell et al. (2001) identified the PIK3C2A
sequence on chromosome 11p15.1-p14.

610716	TITLE *610716 TIMELESS-INTERACTING PROTEIN; TIPIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mouse Timeless (TIM; 603887) in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a mouse
embryo cDNA library, Gotter (2003) cloned Tipin. By EST database
analysis and RT-PCR of brain mRNA, he cloned full-length human TIPIN.
The deduced 301-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
34.5 kD. It shares 72% amino acid identity with mouse Tipin, with the
greatest divergence in the C termini. Northern blot analysis of mouse
embryos detected highest Tipin levels between embryonic days 11 and 15.
In situ hybridization showed coexpression of Tim and Tipin in early
embryonic and extraembryonic tissues, although Tipin was more widely
expressed. After embryonic day 14.5, both Tim and Tipin were abundantly
expressed in thymus, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and ventricular zone
of brain, and Tipin was also expressed in lung. In adult mouse brain,
Tipin was expressed in thalamic and cortical regions, with lower
expression in suprachiasmatic nuclei.

By Western blot analysis of HeLa cells, Chou and Elledge (2006) found
that TIPIN had an apparent molecular mass of 48 kD. Immunofluorescence
localization detected TIPIN in HeLa cell nuclei. TIPIN colocalized with
chromatin and was excluded from the nucleolus.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Gotter (2003) showed that mouse Tipin
interacted with Tim in vitro and in cultured cells. In transiently
transfected cells, Tim promoted nuclear localization of Tipin.
Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Tipin disrupted the ability
of Tim to form homomultimeric complexes, suggesting a mechanism through
which Tipin may modulate Tim function.

Chou and Elledge (2006) found that TIPIN associated with the components
of the replicative helicase (e.g., MCM7; 600592) in human cell lines and
protected cells against genotoxic agents. TIPIN was required for
efficient cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage, and depletion of
TIPIN rendered cells sensitive to ionizing radiation as well as
replication stress. Loss of TIPIN resulted in spontaneous gamma-H2AX
(601772) foci, a marker for DNA double-strand breaks. TIPIN and TIM
formed a complex that maintained the level of both proteins in cells,
and loss of either one led to loss of the other.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gotter (2003) determined that the TIPIN gene contains 8 exons and spans
20 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gotter (2003) mapped the TIPIN gene to
chromosome 15q22.31. He mapped the mouse Tipin gene to a region of
chromosome 9 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
15q22.31.

612476	TITLE *612476 BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, ATF-LIKE; BATF
;;B-CELL ACTIVATING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR;;
BATF1;;
SFA2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BATF is a transcription factor expressed in hematopoietic cells (Meyer
et al., 1998).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a B-cell cDNA library using the N
terminus of v-myc (190080) as bait, Dorsey et al. (1995) isolated BATF.
The 125-amino acid protein has a serine-rich N terminus and a central
basic leucine zipper (bZIP) region. Northern blot analysis revealed a
1.0-kb transcript in human lung, placenta, liver, kidney, spleen, and
peripheral blood, but not in several other tissues examined. BATF
expression was detected in colorectal carcinoma and hematopoietic tumor
cell lines, but not in lung carcinoma, HeLa, or melanoma cell lines.
Immunohistochemical and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated expression
of a nuclear BATF protein in transfected COS-1 cells.

By differential screening of an adult T-cell leukemia cell line cDNA
library to identify human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-1-induced genes,
Hasegawa et al. (1996) cloned BATF, which they termed SFA2. In addition
to leucine-rich and bZIP regions, BATF contains a potential N-terminal
casein kinase II (see 115440) phosphorylation site. Northern blot
analysis detected strong expression of BATF in both mature B and T
lymphocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis and in vitro binding assays, Dorsey et al.
(1995) showed that BATF formed heterodimers with JUN (165160), JUNB
(165161), and JUND (165162). BATF did not form homodimers. EMSA analysis
showed that BATF-JUN heterodimers bound to activator protein-1 (AP1; see
165160) sites in vitro. Dorsey et al. (1995) proposed that BATF is a
tissue-specific regulator of the AP1 transcription complex.

By analyzing gene expression in sorted CD8 (see 186910)-positive T cells
specific for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see 609423) Gag
protein from HIV-positive individuals, Quigley et al. (2010) showed that
the PD1 (PDCD1; 600244) inhibitory receptor coordinately upregulated a
program of genes in 'exhausted' CD8-positive T cells. The program
included upregulation of BATF. Enforced expression of BATF was
sufficient to impair T-cell proliferation and cytokine secretion,
whereas BATF knockdown reduced PD1 inhibition. BATF silencing in T cells
from individuals with chronic viremia rescued HIV-specific T-cell
function. Quigley et al. (2010) concluded that inhibitory receptors can
cause T-cell exhaustion by upregulating genes, such as BATF, that
inhibit T-cell function and may be targets to improve T-cell immunity to
HIV.

BATF3 (612470) is required for homeostatic development of
CD8-alpha-positive classical dendritic cells that prime CD8 T-cell
responses against intracellular pathogens. Tussiwand et al. (2012)
identified an alternative, Batf3-independent pathway in mice for
CD8-alpha-positive dendritic cell development operating during infection
with intracellular pathogens and mediated by the cytokines interleukin
(IL)-12 (161560) and interferon-gamma (147570). This alternative pathway
results from molecular compensation for Batf3 provided by the related
AP1 factors Batf, which also functions in T and B cells, and Batf2
(614983) induced by cytokines in response to infection. Reciprocally,
physiologic compensation between Batf and Batf3 also occurs in T cells
for expression of IL10 (124092) and CTLA4 (123890). Compensation among
BATF factors is based on the shared capacity of their leucine zipper
domains to interact with non-AP1 factors such as IRF4 (601900) and IRF8
(601565) to mediate cooperative gene activation.

Li et al. (2012) showed that in mouse CD4+ T cells and B cells IRF4
unexpectedly can cooperate with AP1 complexes to bind to AP1-IRF4
composite (5-prime-TGAnTCA/GAAA-3-prime) motifs that they denoted as
AP1-IRF composite elements (AICEs). Moreover, BATF-JUN family protein
complexes cooperate with IRF4 in binding to AICEs in preactivated CD4+ T
cells stimulated with IL21 (605384) and in TH17 differentiated cells.
Importantly, BATF binding was diminished in Irf4-null T cells, and IRF4
binding was diminished in Batf-null T cells, consistent with functional
cooperation between these factors. Moreover, Li et al. (2012) showed
that AP1 and IRF complexes cooperatively promote transcription of the
Il10 gene, which is expressed in TH17 cells and potently regulated by
IL21. Li et al. (2012) concluded that their findings revealed that IRF4
can signal via complexes containing ETS or AP1 motifs depending on the
cellular context.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and T-helper-17 (TH17)
cells, Glasmacher et al. (2012) found that IRF4 targets sequences
enriched for activated protein-1 (AP1; 165160)-IRF composite elements
(AICEs) that are cobound by BATF, an AP1 factor required for TH17, B,
and dendritic cell differentiation. IRF4 and BATF bind cooperatively to
structurally divergent AICEs to promote gene activation and TH17
differentiation. The AICE motif directs assembly of IRF4 or IRF8 with
BATF heterodimers and is also used in TH2, B, and dendritic cells.
Glasmacher et al. (2012) concluded that this genomic regulatory element
and cognate factors appear to have evolved to integrate diverse
immunomodulatory signals.

GENE STRUCTURE

Meyer et al. (1998) determined that the BATF gene contains 3 exons and
spans approximately 17 kb.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Meyer et al. (1998) mapped the BATF gene to chromosome
14q24.

ANIMAL MODEL

After a gene expression survey identified Batf as highly expressed in
Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells compared with naive T and B cells, Schraml et
al. (2009) generated mice lacking Batf. Batf -/- mice were fertile and
appeared healthy, with normal immune system organs and development of T
and B lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Although Batf -/- mice animals
showed normal Th1 and Th2 differentiation, Th17 conditions resulted in
reduced Il17 (see IL17A; 603149) production. Batf -/- T cells failed to
induce factors required for Th17 differentiation, such as Rorgt (RORC;
602943) and Il21 (605384), but addition of these factors did not fully
restore Il17 production. Batf -/- mice had a T-cell-intrinsic defect
preventing development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis that
was T-regulatory cell independent. Microarray and quantitative RT-PCR
analyses showed that the Th17 regulatory genes Rorc, Rora (600825), Ahr
(600253), Il22 (605330), and Il17 were Batf dependent. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation and EMSA analyses revealed that Batf bound to the
proximal Il17a, Il17f (606496), Il21, and Il22 promoters, and that Batf
preferentially formed heterodimers with Junb during Th17
differentiation. Schraml et al. (2009) concluded that BATF is
selectively required for Th17, but not Th2, differentiation.

602113	TITLE *602113 MYELOID/LYMPHOID OR MIXED LINEAGE LEUKEMIA 2; MLL2
;;ALL1-RELATED GENE; ALR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The SET domain is a motif characteristic of proteins such as human ALL1
(159555) and Drosophila 'trithorax' (trx) and is found at the C terminus
of the 2 proteins. Using the ALL1 SET domain as a probe, Prasad et al.
(1997) cloned a novel gene, which they designated ALR (ALL1-related
gene). The gene encodes a 5,262-amino acid protein containing a SET
domain, 5 PHD fingers, potential zinc fingers, and a long run of
glutamines interrupted by hydrophobic residues (mostly leucine). They
also detected an alternatively spliced form encoding 4,957 amino acids
and lacking an N-terminal zinc finger and PHD finger. Analysis of ALR
expression showed that its approximately 18-kb transcript is expressed,
like ALL1, in most adult tissues, including a variety of hematopoietic
cells, but not in liver. Whole mount in situ hybridization of early
mouse embryos indicated expression of a similar mouse gene in multiple
tissues. Based on similarities in structure and expression pattern,
Prasad et al. (1997) concluded that ALR is likely to play a role similar
to those of ALL1 and trx.

OTHER FEATURES

By database searching, Karlin et al. (2002) identified 192 human protein
sequences that have multiple amino acid runs, many of which are
associated with disease, including cancer. Karlin et al. (2002) found
that a key aspect of 82 of these protein sequences is their role in
transcription, translation, and developmental regulation. MLL2 is a
striking example with 24 amino acid runs, all but 2 of which are
glutamine runs. Karlin et al. (2002) concluded that genes encoding a
significant number of long amino acid runs are potentially associated
with disease.

MAPPING

By analysis of rodent/human hybrid cells and analysis of the Genebridge
radiation hybrid panel, Prasad et al. (1997) mapped the ALR gene to the
12p13.1-qter region and within a 13-cR chromosome region corresponding
to a physical size of approximately 340 kb near D12S1401. Based on
information from 3 databases, they placed ALR between vitamin D receptor
(601769) at 12q12-q14 and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (138420),
which is located in the same region. Prasad et al. (1997) noted that the
12q12-q13 region is involved in duplications and translocations
associated with cancer.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Kabuki Syndrome 1

Ng et al. (2010) performed the exome sequencing of 10 unrelated patients
with Kabuki syndrome (KABUK1; 147920), 7 of European ancestry, 2 of
Hispanic ancestry and 1 of mixed European and Haitian ancestry, and
identified nonsense or frameshift mutations in the MLL2 gene in 7
patients. Follow-up Sanger sequencing detected MLL2 mutations in 2 of
the 3 remaining individuals with Kabuki syndrome and in 26 of 43
additional cases. In all, they identified 33 distinct MLL2 mutations in
35 of 53 families (66%) with Kabuki syndrome (see, e.g.,
602113.0001-602113.0004). In each of 12 cases for which DNA from both
parents was available, the MLL2 variant was found to have occurred de
novo. MLL2 mutations were also identified in each of 2 families in which
Kabuki syndrome was transmitted from parent to child. None of the
additional MLL2 mutations was found in 190 control chromosomes from
individuals of matched geographic ancestry. Ng et al. (2010) suggested
that mutations in MLL2 are a major cause of Kabuki syndrome.

Hannibal et al. (2011) identified 70 mutations in the MLL2 gene in 81
(74%) of 110 kindreds with Kabuki syndrome. In simplex cases for which
DNA was available from both parents, 25 mutations were confirmed to be
de novo, whereas a transmitted mutation was found in 2 of 3 familial
cases. Most of the variants were nonsense or frameshift mutations
predicted to result in haploinsufficiency. Mutations occurred throughout
the gene, but were particularly common in exons 39 and 48. The clinical
features of those with or without mutations were similar, except for
renal anomalies, which occurred in 47% of mutation carriers compared to
14% of those who did not have a mutation.

Li et al. (2011) sequenced all 54 coding exons of the MLL2 gene in 34
patients with Kabuki syndrome and identified 18 distinct mutations in 19
patients, 11 of 12 tested de novo. Mutations were located throughout the
gene and included 3 nonsense mutations, 2 splice site mutations, 6 small
deletions or insertions, and 7 missense mutations. Li et al. (2011)
compared frequencies of clinical symptoms in MLL2 mutation carriers
versus noncarriers. MLL2 mutation carriers more often presented with
short stature and renal anomalies (p = 0.026 and 0.031, respectively),
and in addition, MLL2 showed a more typical facial gestalt (17 of 19)
compared with noncarriers (9 of 15), although this result was not
statistically significant (p = 0.1). Mutation-negative patients were
subsequently tested for mutations in 10 functional candidate genes, but
no convincing causative mutations could be identified. Li et al. (2011)
concluded that MLL2 is the major gene for Kabuki syndrome with a wide
spectrum of de novo mutations but that there is further genetic
heterogeneity accounting for MLL2 mutation-negative patients.

Banka et al. (2012) analyzed the MLL2 gene in a cohort of 116 patients
with Kabuki syndrome, including 18 patients previously reported by
Hannibal et al. (2011), and identified MLL2 variants in 74 (63.8%).
Banka et al. (2012) stated that 170 (73.2%) of 232 published MLL2
mutation-positive kabuki syndrome patients had truncating mutations.
They also noted that pathogenic missense mutations were commonly located
in exon 48.

- Somatic Mutations

Parsons et al. (2011) identified inactivating mutations in the MLL2 gene
in approximately 10% of sequenced medulloblastomas from children.

Morin et al. (2011) found that somatic mutations in MLL2 were present in
32% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 89% of follicular lymphoma
cases.

609130	TITLE *609130 APOPTOSIS-INDUCING, TAF9-LIKE DOMAIN 1; APITD1
;;CENTROMERIC PROTEIN S; CENPS;;
FANCM-INTERACTING HISTONE-FOLD PROTEIN 1; MHF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Fanconi anemia (FA) nuclear core complex (see 607139) is required
for DNA damage response and repair. STRA13 (615128) and APITD1 form a
heterodimeric DNA-remodeling complex that interacts with the FA complex
component FANCM (609644) to facilitate repair of branched DNA (Yan et
al., 2010; Singh et al., 2010).

CLONING

Using in silico mapping methods, Krona et al. (2004) identified 2
alternatively spliced transcripts of a novel gene, designated APITD1,
within a 500-kb neuroblastoma tumor suppressor candidate region on
chromosome 1p36.22. Transcript A encodes a deduced 138-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 16 kD, and transcript B
encodes a deduced 99-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass
of 11 kD. Both proteins contain a TAF9 (313650)-like domain. Northern
blot analysis of neuroblastoma cell lines detected ubiquitous expression
of a major, approximately 1.5 kb and a minor, less than 1 kb transcript.
Expression of transcript A was generally higher in fetal tissues,
whereas that of transcript B was higher in adult tissues. Expression of
both was significantly reduced in several primary neuroblastoma tumors
and in tumors of varied tissue origin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krona et al. (2004) determined that the APITD1 gene contains 6 exons,
including alternative exons 1A and 1B, and spans about 13 kb. Both exons
1A and 1B are preceded by a CpG island.

MAPPING

By analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids, Krona et al. (2004)
mapped the APITD1 gene to chromosome 1. By genomic sequence analysis,
they refined the location of the gene to 1p36.22, in a head-to-tail
orientation between the PGD (172200) and CORT (602784) genes.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation of CENPA (117139)-containing complexes from HeLa
cells, followed by multiple tandem affinity purifications, Foltz et al.
(2006) identified CENPS associated with CENPM (610152) and CENPU
(MLF1IP; 611511) but not directly associated with the CENPA
nucleosome-associated complex.

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis of chicken DT40 cells, Amano et al.
(2009) found that Cenps interacted with Cenpx (STRA13), but not with
other centromeric proteins, in a centromeric protein subcomplex. Cenps
-/- and Cenpx -/- DT40 cells showed slow mitotic progression and
increased numbers of apoptotic cells. Knockdown of CENPS and CENPX in
HeLa cells via small interfering RNA caused more severe mitotic defects,
including misaligned chromosomes. Knockdown of CENPX in DT40 and HeLa
cells eliminated kinetochore localization of CENPS. Knockout of Cenps
and Cenpx reduced localization of the outer kinetochore proteins Ndc80
(607272) and Knl1 (CASC5; 609173) and increased intrakinetochore
distance in the absence of tension. Amano et al. (2009) proposed that
the CENPS-CENPX subcomplex is essential for stable assembly of outer
kinetochore proteins.

Yan et al. (2010) and Singh et al. (2010) independently found that
APITD1 and STRA13, which they called MHF1 and MHF2, were associated with
a high-molecular-mass complex containing FA complex components and Bloom
syndrome complex components (e.g., RECQL3; 604610). MHF1 and MHF2 also
associated in a much smaller complex distinct from the FA core complex.
Coimmunoprecipitation and yeast 2-hybrid analyses confirmed direct
interaction between MHF1 and MHF2. MHF1 and MHF2 appeared to associate
predominantly with FANCM and FAAP24 (C19ORF40; 610884), but not with
other FA complex components. MHF1 mediated interaction of the MHF1-MHF2
heterodimer with FANCM. The MHF1-MHF2 heterodimer, but not either
component alone, also bound several types of branched DNA and enhanced
FANCM binding to branched DNA. HeLa cells depleted of either MHF protein
displayed reduced monoubiquitination and foci formation by FANCD2
(613984) in response to DNA damage. Depletion of the MHF proteins also
resulted in hypersensitivity of cells to DNA-damaging agents. Yan et al.
(2010) found that FANCM and the MHF proteins were recruited to DNA
interstrand crosslinks during S phase, apparently stimulated by DNA
replication. Using a DNA branch migration assay, Singh et al. (2010)
found that the MHF1-MHF2 dimer itself was devoid of activity, but that
it enhanced FANCM-dependent DNA branch migration. Yan et al. (2010) and
Singh et al. (2010) concluded that the MHF1-MHF2 heterodimer is required
for normal activation of the FA pathway in response to DNA damage.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Krona et al. (2004) performed genomic sequence analysis of the APITD1
gene in 44 neuroblastoma tumors and identified no loss-of-function
mutations, indicating that the gene is not a common abnormality of such
tumors.

603320	TITLE *603320 MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 23A; MMP23A
;;MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 21, FORMERLY; MMP21, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The matrix metalloproteinases are secreted glycoproteins that are
involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix. By analysis of
the genomic region surrounding the duplicated genes CDC2L1 (176873) and
CDC2L2 (116951), Gururajan et al. (1998) identified 2 novel matrix
metalloproteinase genes, MMP23A, which they called MMP21, and MMP23B
(603321), which they called MMP22. The nucleotide sequences of MMP21 and
MMP22 are nearly identical. Using a combination of techniques, the
authors isolated cDNAs corresponding to alternatively spliced
transcripts that encode 3 protein isoforms, MMP21/22A, MMP21/22B, and
MMP21/22C. The MMP21 and MMP22 proteins contain prepro-, catalytic,
cysteine-rich, IL1R (147810)-related, and proline-rich domains. Northern
blot analysis revealed that a 1.4-kb MMP21/22 transcript was expressed
in heart, placenta, ovary, testis, and prostate. A 0.8-kb mRNA was
detected in heart and pancreas, and an additional 2.4-kb mRNA was
detected in ovary.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gururajan et al. (1998) determined that the MMP21 and MMP22 genes
contain 8 exons each, and the exons generally correspond to the
structural domains of the putative protein products.

MAPPING

Gururajan et al. (1998) reported that the MMP21 and MMP22 genes are
located within an approximately 140-kb region on chromosome 1p36.3. This
region consists of 2 identical genomic segments, each of which contains
a CDC2L gene linked to an MMP gene. The 3-prime end of the MMP gene is
500 to 800 bp from the 3-prime end of the adjacent CDC2L gene. The genes
are arranged in the order
telomere--MMP22--CDC2L2--CDC2L1--MMP21--centromere. The 2 CDC2L genes
are separated by approximately 50 kb. Gururajan et al. (1998) stated
that although the functional significance of the reiteration of selected
genes within the 1p36.3 region is not known, it might reflect
instability relevant to the observed deletion of 1p36 during
tumorigenesis.

600178	TITLE *600178 MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1A; MAP1A
;;MTAP1A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The assembly of microtubules, an essential step in neurogenesis, is
modulated by a family of molecules called microtubule-associated
proteins (MAPs). These proteins have been divided into 2 main groups by
molecular mass, high molecular weight MAPs, which include MAP1A, MAP1B
(157129), and MAP2 (157130), and another group of intermediate-sized
proteins, which include the abundant tau MAPs. MAP1B, also named MAP5,
is a component of long cross-bridges between microtubules and is a
filamentous molecule with a small spherical segment at one end.

Langkopf et al. (1992) determined the deduced amino acid sequence for
the MAP1A heavy chain from a series of overlapping cDNA clones. The cDNA
encoding MAP1A also encodes one of the MAP1A heavy chain's associated
light chains, LC2.

Lien et al. (1994) completely cloned and sequenced the human MAP1B gene.
By comparison of human MAP1B with sequence databases, they identified a
MAP1B-related gene that is probably the human homolog of rat MAP1A. The
human MAP1A gene is expressed at high levels in brain and spinal cord
and at much lower levels in muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

The MAP1A/LC2 gene is organized in a similar fashion to that of the gene
encoding both MAP1B and LC1 (Hammarback et al., 1991). The encoded
precursor polypeptide presumably undergoes proteolytic processing to
generate the final MAP1A heavy chain and LC2 polypeptides. Fink et al.
(1996) showed that the MAP1A gene contains 5 exons and spans about 10.5
kb. The predicted human and rat proteins are remarkably similar.

MAPPING

Lien et al. (1994) mapped the MAP1A gene to 15q by PCR amplification of
genomic DNA purified from somatic cell hybrid lines and further
sublocalized it using a deletion panel from chromosome 15, 15q13-qter.

GENE FUNCTION

Ikeda et al. (2002) identified the MAP1A gene as the 'modifier of tubby
hearing-1' (moth1) QTL associated with hearing loss in tubby mutants on
the C57BL/6J background. The Map1a cDNA derived from B6 contained 12
single-nucleotide differences which could lead to amino acid alterations
and a difference in the length of a repeat in the open reading frame
when compared with that found in the AKR strain. Ikeda et al. (2002)
used a transgenic rescue experiment to verify that sequence
polymorphisms were crucial for hearing loss phenotype and demonstrated
that the polymorphisms changed the binding efficiency of MAP1A to PSD95
(602887), a core component in the cytoarchitecture of synapses. This
indicates that at least some of the observed polymorphisms are
functionally important and that the hearing loss of C57BL/6J-tub/tub
mice may be caused by impaired protein interactions involving MTAP1A.

601783	TITLE *601783 MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 6; MAP6
;;MTAP6;;
STABLE TUBULE-ONLY POLYPEPTIDE; STOP;;
KIAA1878
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mammalian cells often contain abundant subpopulations of microtubules
that are stable to both drug- and cold temperature-induced disassembly.
Such microtubules are apparently universal in the neurite extensions of
neuronal cells. Bosc et al. (1996) cloned and characterized the gene
encoding a rat protein that reconstitutes microtubule cold stability in
vitro. The protein, called stable tubule-only polypeptide (STOP) by
them, is a 100.5-kD polypeptide. The central region of the predicted
952-amino acid polypeptide contains 5 tandem repeats of 46 amino acids.
STOP also contains a putative SH3-binding motif near its N terminus.

Denarier et al. (1998) determined that the deduced mouse Map6 protein
contains 906 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of about
96.4 kD.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult hippocampus
cDNA library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned MAP6, which they designated
KIAA1878. The transcript contains a repetitive element in the 3-prime
UTR. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest MAP6 expression in fetal brain,
followed by spinal cord, adult brain, testis, kidney, lung, heart, and
ovary. Lower expression was detected in pancreas, spleen, and skeletal
muscle, and little to no expression was detected in adult and fetal
liver. All specific brain regions showed intermediate to high
expression, with highest expression in caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and
cerebellum.

GENE FUNCTION

Bosc et al. (1996) found that in vitro-translated STOP bound to
microtubules and calmodulin (114180). When STOP cDNA was expressed in
HeLa cells, which lack cold-stable microtubules, the protein product
associated with microtubules at 37 degrees C and stabilized microtubule
networks, which induced cold stability, nocodazole resistance, and
tubulin detyrosination.

GENE STRUCTURE

Denarier et al. (1998) determined that the mouse Map6 gene contains 4
exons and spans about 40 kb. The 5-prime flanking region lacks a TATA
box or an initiator element.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the MAP6 gene
to chromosome 11. Jolly et al. (1999) reported a conflicting assignment
of the human MAP6 gene to chromosome 6p12-p11 by FISH. However, Andrieux
et al. (2002) confirmed that the human MAP6 gene maps to chromosome
11q14.

Using FISH, Denarier et al. (1998) mapped the mouse Map6 gene to region
E2-F1 of chromosome 7, which shows homology of synteny to human
chromosome 11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Andrieux et al. (2002) found that Stop-null mice had no detectable
defects in brain anatomy, but they showed synaptic defects, with
depleted synaptic vesicle pools and impaired synaptic plasticity,
associated with severe behavioral disorders. A survey of the effects of
psychotropic drugs on the behavior of Stop-null mice showed a specific
effect of long-term administration of neuroleptics in alleviating these
disorders.

605975	TITLE *605975 SERINE/ARGININE REPETITIVE MATRIX PROTEIN 1; SRRM1
;;SERINE/ARGININE-RICH SPLICING FACTOR-RELATED NUCLEAR MATRIX PROTEIN,
160-KD;;
SR-RELATED NUCLEAR MATRIX PROTEIN, 160-KD; SRM160
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pre-mRNA synthesis and processing involves factors widely distributed
throughout the nucleus, with concentrations in 2 types of foci, speckles
and coiled bodies. A subset of splicing factors in speckles is
associated with the nuclear matrix. One of these, SRM160, forms a
complex with SRM300 (606032) that functions as a pre-mRNA-specific
splicing coordinator (Blencowe et al., 1998).

For background information on the SR family of serine/arginine-rich
splicing factors, see 600812.

CLONING

By biochemical purification, micropeptide sequence analysis, EST
database searching, and screening a monocytoid cDNA library, Blencowe et
al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding SRM160 (SR-related matrix protein of
160 kD) and several isoforms. The deduced 820-amino acid protein is rich
in SR/RS repeats and proline residues. SRM160 also has multiple putative
phosphorylation sites and SH3-binding motifs but no RNA-recognition
domains. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a ubiquitous,
variably expressed 3.8-kb transcript and a more restricted 6.0-kb
transcript. Immunoblot analysis showed that the recombinant protein was
expressed as a 160-kD protein in nuclear extract and that it could be
reduced to a 120-kD protein by phosphatase treatment. Confocal
microscopy demonstrated expression of SRM160 in nuclear speckles.
Immunoprecipitation analysis detected interaction of SRM160 with SRM300
(606032), a nuclear matrix antigen, and 2 other SR proteins, SRp40
(600914) and SRp75 (601940). EMSA analysis indicated that SRM160/SRM300
associates with pre-mRNA and promotes splicing through interactions with
SR family proteins. The association between SRM160/SRM300 and pre-mRNA
is dependent on RNU1 (180680) and is stabilized by RNU2 (180690).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SRM160
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP RH40469).

150150	TITLE *150150 LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE C; LDHC
;;LDH, TESTICULAR FORM; LDHX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zinkham et al. (1964) found a distinctive LDH isozyme in mature testes
of many species including man. It is polymorphic in the pigeon, and one
can infer that a locus separate from LDHA (150000) and LDHB (150100)
controls it. The same is almost certainly true in the human. This is a
gene that functions only in one sex and only in one tissue.

Sakai et al. (1987) isolated and sequenced cDNA clones of LDHC from the
mouse. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)-containing RNAs from mouse
testes and liver indicated that the Ldhc gene was expressed in testes
but not in liver. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of mouse Ldhc
showed 73 and 72% homology, respectively, with those of mouse Ldha.
Southern blot analysis of genomic DNAs from mouse liver and human
placenta indicated the presence of multiple LDH-C gene-related
sequences. From the amino acid sequence deduced from cDNA, Millan et al.
(1987) found that human LDHC is as different from rodent Ldhc (73%
homology) as it is from human LDHA (76% homology) and porcine LDHB (68%
homology).

MAPPING

Zinkham et al. (1969) found that the LDHB and LDHC loci are closely
linked in pigeons. Edwards et al. (1987) used an LDHC cDNA to analyze
genomic DNA from rodent/human somatic cell hybrids. These showed that
LDHA and LDHC are syntenic on human chromosome 11. The assignment of
LDHC was confirmed by Kao et al. (1988), who localized the gene to
11p15.5-p14.3 by use of somatic cell hybrids and in situ chromosome
hybridization. Li et al. (1988) also assigned LDHC to chromosome 11 by
hybridization of DNA from flow-sorted chromosomes. The close physical
proximity of the LDHC and LDHA genes supports the evolutionary
relatedness of the 2 isozymes. Edwards et al. (1989) reported mapping of
LDHC to 11p15.5-p15.3 by combination of somatic cell hybrid studies and
in situ hybridization.

614235	TITLE *614235 PDZ DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 8; PDZD8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PDZD8 is a cytoskeletal regulatory protein that interacts with moesin
(MSN; 309845) and regulates stable microtubule abundance. Both MSN and
PDZD8 suppress herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection, but PDZD8 also
promotes human immunodeficiency (HIV)-1 infection (see 609423) (Henning
et al., 2010, 2011).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a human testis cDNA library with HIV-1
Gag as bait, Henning et al. (2010) cloned PDZD8. The predicted
1,154-amino acid protein contains a PDZ domain, a zinc finger domain,
and a coiled-coil motif.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid screening, Henning et al. (2010) showed that PDZD8
amino acids 932 to 1119, including the coiled-coil motif, interacted
with HIV-1 Gag amino acids 59 to 250. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis
confirmed the interaction. Overexpression of PDZD8 in human cells
promoted initiation of retroviral transcription and HIV-1 infection,
whereas knockdown of PDZD8 decreased HIV-1 infection. A PDZD8 mutant
lacking the coiled-coil domain failed to bind Gag and promote HIV-1
infection.

By yeast 2-hybrid screening and coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Henning
et al. (2011) found that amino acids 990 to 1155 of human PDZD8
interacted with amino acids 158 to 279 of moesin. Expression of PDZD8 or
moesin reduced the levels of stable microtubules in the human CHME3
microglial cell line. In addition, expression of PDZD8 or moesin reduced
the cytopathic effects of HSV-1, as well as HSV-1 replication and
spread, in CHME3 cells.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the PDZD8 gene to chromosome 10q25.3-q26.11 based on
an alignment of the PDZD8 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC028375) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

611007	TITLE *611007 MEX3, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, A; MEX3A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

C. elegans Mex3 is a regulator of translation that specifies posterior
blastomere identity in the early embryo and contributes to the
maintenance of germline totipotency. By database analysis and RT-PCR,
Buchet-Poyau et al. (2007) cloned a family of 4 human genes homologous
to C. elegans Mex3, including MEX3A. Like the other human MEX3 proteins,
the deduced 520-amino acid MEX3A protein has an N-terminal nuclear
export signal (NES), 2 heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K
(HNRNPK; 600712) homology (KH) domains, and a C-terminal RING finger
domain. The KH domains are present in C. elegans Mex3, but not the RING
domain. RT-PCR detected variable expression of MEX3A in human tissues
and cell lines, with highest levels in fetal brain and testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Western blot analysis of transfected human embryonic kidney cells
and kinase assays, Buchet-Poyau et al. (2007) showed that MEX3A, MEX3B
(611008), and MEX3C (611005) were phosphoproteins. RNA
homopolymer-binding assays and immunoprecipitation analysis revealed
that MEX3A, MEX3B, and MEX3C bound RNA via their KH domains in vitro and
in vivo. Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected breast cancer cells
showed that MEX3A, MEX3B, and MEX3C shuttled between the nucleus and
cytoplasm in an NES-dependent manner. MEX3A and MEX3B colocalized with
DCP1A (607010) decapping factor and argonaute proteins (e.g., AGO1;
606228) in processing (P) bodies, which are centers for mRNA turnover.
Buchet-Poyau et al. (2007) proposed that MEX3 proteins may function in
maintenance of pluripotent cells, i.e., stem cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Buchet-Poyau et al. (2007) determined that the MEX3A gene contains 2
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Buchet-Poyau et al. (2007) mapped the
MEX3A gene to chromosome 1q22.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Shirasu et al. (1999) cloned the cDNA of a human gene, designated CHP1,
that encodes a 332-amino acid protein containing 2 CHORD domains. CHORD
was defined as a 60-amino acid, cysteine- and histidine-rich,
Zn(2+)-binding domain that is conserved in tandem organization in
protozoa, plants, and metazoa.

GENE FUNCTION

Shirasu et al. (1999) found that silencing of the C. elegans
CHORD-containing gene, chp, resulted in semisterility and embryo
lethality, suggesting an essential function of the wildtype gene in
nematode development.

613137	TITLE *613137 TETRASPANIN 9; TSPAN9
;;NEW EST TETRASPAN 5; NET5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the tetraspanin superfamily, such as TSPAN9, are
characterized by the presence of 4 transmembrane domains. Tetraspanins
associate in large membrane complexes with other molecules, particularly
integrins (see ITGB1; 135630), and function in cell adhesion, migration,
and signaling (summary by Serru et al., 2000).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for tetraspanin-like sequences, followed by
5-prime RACE of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Serru et al. (2000) cloned
TSPAN9, which they called NET5. The deduced 239-amino acid protein
contains 4 transmembrane segments and other characteristics of a
tetraspanin. RT-PCR detected TSPAN9 expression in all human cell lines
examined.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the TSPAN9 gene to chromosome 12p13.32 based on an
alignment of the TSPAN9 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF217967) with the

;;CAS-INTERACTING ZINC FINGER PROTEIN; CIZ;;
CAGH1;;
NUCLEAR MATRIX PROTEIN 4; NMP4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZNF384 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that localizes at
fibroblast focal adhesions, contains multiple zinc fingers, and
regulates expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g., MMP3; 185250)
(Thunyakitpisal et al., 2001).

CLONING

By screening adult and fetal human brain cDNA libraries for clones
containing CAG repeats, Margolis et al. (1997) isolated a partial cDNA
encoding ZNF384, which they called CAGH1.

By Far Western screening of a rat embryonic fibroblast cDNA library with
the SH3 domain of Cas (BCAR1; 602941) as probe, Nakamoto et al. (2000)
isolated several splice variants of Znf384, which they called Ciz. The
longest variant encodes a predicted 579-residue protein with an
N-terminal leucine zipper, multiple serine and proline residues, a
nuclear localization signal, 8 centrally located Kruppel-type C2H2 zinc
fingers, and C-terminal glutamine-alanine and glutamine repeat regions,
suggesting that Ciz may be a transcription factor. The shorter variants
encode proteins with only 5 or 6 zinc fingers. Northern blot analysis of
rat tissues revealed ubiquitous expression of a 3.0-kb transcript, with
highest levels in testis, heart, kidney, and brain. A 4.0-kb transcript
was also detected in brain, liver, and kidney. Immunofluorescence
microscopy showed that Ciz shuttled in and out of the nucleus and
localized at stably formed focal adhesions and in the nucleus.

Thunyakitpisal et al. (2001) independently cloned and characterized rat
Znf384, which they termed Nmp4, based on its interaction with type I
collagen alpha-1 (COL1A1; 120150). They identified several novel
variants, including one that lacks the C-terminal glutamine-alanine
repeat region.

GENE FUNCTION

Using precipitation analysis, Nakamoto et al. (2000) showed that rat Ciz
bound specifically and constitutively to the SH3 domain of Cas.
Immunoprecipitation and EMSA analysis demonstrated that Ciz bound to the
promoter of human MMP1 (120353) and upregulated transcription of human
MMP1 and MMP7 (178990) and rat Mmp3.

Thunyakitpisal et al. (2001) showed that rat Nmp4 interacted with Col1a1
and regulated its expression in osteoblasts. They concluded that NMP4
contributes to extracellular matrix turnover in bone and other tissues.

Shen et al. (2002) overexpressed Ciz in a mouse osteoblast cell line and
found that it inhibited Bmp2 (112261)-induced expression of alkaline
phosphatase (see ALPL; 171760), osteocalcin (BGLAP; 112260), type I
collagen, and Cbfa1 (RUNX2; 600211). They concluded that CIZ is an
inhibitory protein that modulates BMP2-induced differentiation of
osteoblastic cells.

MAPPING

Margolis et al. (1997) stated that the ZFN384 gene maps to chromosome
12p12. Alvarez et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Znf384 gene to chromosome
6F1, a region that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 12p12.

ANIMAL MODEL

Morinobu et al. (2005) found that Ciz -/- mice had increased bone volume
and rates of bone formation, but no alteration in bone resorption. Ciz
-/- mice expressed higher levels of mRNA for proteins involved in
osteoblastic phenotypes, such as alkaline phosphatase and osterix (SP7;
606633). Ciz deficiency increased newly formed bone mass after femoral
bone marrow ablation, and it increased Bmp2-induced bone formation in
adult mouse calvariae. Morinobu et al. (2005) concluded that CIZ
suppresses the levels of adult bone mass through inhibition of
BMP-induced activation of osteoblasts.

604602	TITLE *604602 RIBOSOME-RECYCLING FACTOR, MITOCHONDRIAL; MRRF
;;RRF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The termination of protein synthesis requires the action of several
auxiliary factors. In bacteria, ribosome-recycling factor (Rrf) is
essential for the release of ribosomes from the mRNA at the stop codon.
Mitochondria perform protein synthesis using a translation system that
has some features reminiscent of prokaryotic translation and other
features that are unique. By searching an EST database using the E. coli
Rrf protein sequence as the query, Zhang and Spremulli (1998) identified
human ESTs encoding mitochondrial ribosome-recycling factor (MRRF). They
assembled the complete MRRF coding sequence using ESTs. Sequence
analysis of the deduced 263-amino acid MRRF protein indicated that it is
likely localized in the mitochondria; however, MRRF does not have a
clear cleavage signal for removal of the signal peptide. Human MRRF
shares approximately 25 to 30% amino acid sequence identity with
bacterial RRFs.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro assays with recombinant human proteins, Tsuboi et al.
(2009) showed that RRF interacted directly with EFG2 (GFM2; 606544) and
that both were required for ribosome dissociation from mRNA. GTP, but
not GTP hydrolysis, was also required. GTP hydrolysis by EFG2 appeared
to follow the ribosome splitting reaction and occurred on the ribosomal
large subunit. EFG2 and RRF remained on the large subunit until GTP was
hydrolyzed and prevented reassociation of subunits.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hansen et al. (2000) assigned the MRRF
gene to chromosome 9q32-q34.1.

609737	TITLE *609737 CRUMBS, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 3; CRB3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching for mammalian Crumbs family members (see CRB1,
604210), Makarova et al. (2003) identified and subsequently cloned CRB3
from human retina cDNA. The CRB3 cDNA encodes a deduced 120-amino acid
protein with a putative signal peptide in the first 20 amino acids, a
putative extracellular N-glycosylation site, and a transmembrane domain.
The intracellular domain contains a conserved band-4.1
superfamily-binding site and a Pals PDZ domain-binding site, as found in
Drosophila Crumbs and human CRB1. Makarova et al. (2003) also identified
mouse Crb3. The intracellular domains of the human and mouse proteins
are highly conserved. Using RT-PCR, Makarova et al. (2003) found high
levels of CRB3 mRNA in lung, kidney, retina, colon, and mammary gland,
and moderate levels in liver, spleen, pancreas, placenta, and prostate.
By Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues, Lemmers et al.
(2004) demonstrated CRB3 expression in all epithelial tissues analyzed
and in skeletal muscle, with weak expression in brain.

GENE FUNCTION

From immunoprecipitation assays carried out with Madin Darby canine
kidney (MDCK) cell lysates, Makarova et al. (2003) showed that CRB3
binds with PALS1 (MMP5; 606958) and the PALS1-associated tight junction
protein, PATJ (see 603199). The PALS1 PDZ domain was found to be
necessary for CRB3 binding. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that
CRB3 is N-glycosylated. Makarova et al. (2003) demonstrated that CRB3 is
localized to the apical surface and tight junctions of MDCK cells and
that this localization is not dependent on glycosylation.

Lemmers et al. (2004) demonstrated that the apical localization of CRB3
is not dependent on the PDZ-binding domain (ERLI). Lemmers et al. (2004)
found that expression of CRB3 or of a chimera containing the
extracellular domain of the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR (NGFR; 162010)
and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of CRB3 led to a slower
development of functional tight junctions in MDCK cells. This phenotype
relied on the presence of the CRB3 PDZ-binding domain, which is involved
in a direct interaction with PAR6-alpha (PARD6A; 607484), a regulator of
epithelial polarity and tight junction formation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lemmers et al. (2004) determined that the CRB3 gene contains 4 exons,
with the last exon containing the 3-prime untranslated region.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CRB3
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP STS-N23258).

613497	TITLE *613497 LIPASE A, LYSOSOMAL ACID; LIPA
;;LYSOSOMAL ACID LIPASE; LAL;;
CHOLESTEROL ESTER HYDROLASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Anderson and Sando (1991) reported that the amino acid sequence of LAL
as deduced from the 2.6-kb cDNA nucleotide sequence is 58% identical to
that of human gastric lipase (LIPF; 601980), which is involved in the
preduodenal breakdown of ingested triglycerides.

Anderson et al. (1994) isolated and sequenced the gene for LIPA.

GENE FUNCTION

The distinct kinetic and physical properties of lipases A and B (LIPB;
247980) were defined by Warner et al. (1980). They stated that the
natural substrate for LIPB was not known, and that it was not clear that
LIPB is a lysosomal hydrolase. LIPA may serve an important role in
cellular metabolism by releasing cholesterol. The liberated cholesterol
suppresses further cholesterol synthesis and stimulates esterification
of cholesterol within the cell.

GENE STRUCTURE

Aslanidis et al. (1994) summarized the exon structure of the LIPA gene,
which consists of 10 exons, together with the sizes of genomic EcoRI and
SacI fragments hybridizing to each exon. The DNA sequence of the
putative promoter region was presented.

Anderson et al. (1994) found that the LIPA gene is spread over 36 kb of
genomic DNA. The 5-prime flanking region is GC-rich and has
characteristics of a 'housekeeping' gene promoter.

MAPPING

Koch et al. (1979, 1981) assigned lysosomal acid lipase A to chromosome
10 by human-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids. Judging from the close
concordance with soluble glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT1;
138180), these loci were thought to be close together on the long arm of
10. Lipase A is encoded by chromosome 19 in mouse (Koch et al., 1981).
GOT1 is also on chromosome 10q in man and 19 in mouse.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Anderson et al. (1993) mapped the
LIPA locus to 10q23.2-q.23.3. It was clearly distinct from the locus for
pancreatic lipase (246600) at 10q26.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) and Wolman disease are
autosomal recessive allelic disorders (278000) associated with reduced
activity and genetic defects of lysosomal acid lipase. Aslanidis et al.
(1996) provided evidence that the strikingly more severe course of
Wolman disease is caused by genetic defects of LAL that leave no
residual enzyme activity. In a CESD patient, a G-to-A transition at
position -1 of the exon 8 splice donor site (613497.0002) resulted in
skipping of exon 8 in 97% of the mRNA originating from this allele,
while 3% was spliced correctly, resulting in full-length LAL enzyme. Two
sibs with Wolman disease were homozygous for a splice site mutation
involving the same donor site but permitting no correct splicing or
subsequent synthesis of functional enzyme (613497.0004).

Pagani et al. (1996) described the molecular basis of CESD in 3
patients. They identified mutations by sequence analysis of LAL cDNA and
genomic DNA. The role of the mutations as the direct cause of the
disease was confirmed by measuring the LAL enzymatic activity of
extracts from cells transfected with LAL mutants. The 3 CESD patients
were found to be compound heterozygotes. Pagani et al. (1996) identified
3 different missense mutations, 2 splicing defects, and a null allele.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
WOLMAN DISEASE
CHOLESTERYL ESTER STORAGE DISEASE, INCLUDED
LIPA, LEU179PRO

In a proband with Wolman disease (278000) from a nonconsanguineous
family, Anderson et al. (1994) detected a T-to-C transition at
nucleotide 639 of the LIPA gene that resulted in a nonconservative
missense mutation, leu179 to pro (L179P). This mutation was found in
compound heterozygosity with a single-base insertion resulting in a null
allele (613497.0004). The proband had had 2 older sibs with Wolman
disease. Anderson et al. (1994) noted that the L179P mutation is located
26 amino acids from the predicted active site of lysosomal acid lipase
and was expected to disrupt the alpha-helical structure in a highly
conserved region of the protein.

Maslen and Illingworth (1993) and Maslen et al. (1995) found the L179P
mutation in 2 sibs with cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD). In
these sibs the L179P mutation, inherited from the mother, was found in
compound heterozygosity with a splice site mutation that resulted in
skipping of exon 8 of lysosomal acid lipase (613497.0002). Maslen et al.
(1995) compared the phenotypes of other patients carrying the L179P or
the splice site mutation described by them and concluded that the L179P
mutant allele apparently does not make a substantial contribution to
cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity.

.0002
CHOLESTERYL ESTER STORAGE DISEASE
LIPA, 934G-A

In a 12-year-old patient with cholesteryl ester storage disease (278000)
from a nonconsanguineous Polish-German family, Klima et al. (1993)
detected a 72-bp in-frame deletion resulting in the loss of amino acid
codons 254 through 277. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed that the 72 bp
represented an exon, indicating that the deletion in the mRNA was caused
by defective splicing. Sequence analysis of the patient's genomic DNA
revealed a G-to-A substitution in the last nucleotide of the 72-bp exon
on 1 allele. No normal-sized mRNA was detectable in the propositus even
though he was not homozygous for the splice site mutation. Klima et al.
(1993) concluded that the patient was compound heterozygous for the
splice site mutation and a null allele. The patient showed LIPA activity
in cultured skin fibroblasts approximately 9% of normal.
Hepatosplenomegaly had been present since age 5 years.

Aslanidis et al. (1996) restudied the patient of Klima et al. (1993) and
defined the splice site mutation as a G-to-A mutation at position -1 of
the splice donor site following exon 8, resulting in incorrect splicing
and the removal of the 72-bp exon 8 of the LIPA gene. They determined
that the other allele of the patient carried a premature termination
mutation (613497.0003) as well as the L179P mutation (613497.0001); the
LIPA mRNA was rendered unstable by the premature stop codon. Aslanidis
et al. (1996) demonstrated that the splice site mutation allowed the
production of approximately 3 to 4% of correctly spliced mRNA relative
to wildtype. Aslanidis et al. (1996) also identified a mutation at the
same splice donor site, and also resulting in deletion of exon 8, in 2
sibs with Wolman disease; that mutation, at the +1 position, allowed no
correct splicing, and patient fibroblasts were devoid of enzymatic
activity. See 613497.0005.

In 2 sibs with CESD, Maslen and Illingworth (1993) and Maslen et al.
(1995) identified compound heterozygosity for this splice site mutation
in the LIPA gene, inherited from their father, and the L179P mutation
(613497.0001). The affected children were a sister and brother who
presented with idiopathic hepatomegaly at ages 6 and 8 years,
respectively. Subsequent analyses indicated that they also had
hypercholesterolemia and a severe reduction in cholesteryl ester
hydrolase activity in cultured fibroblasts.

Muntoni et al. (1995) observed homozygosity for the splice site mutation
(Klima et al., 1993) in a Spanish kindred with cholesterol ester storage
disease. Exon 8 of the LIPA gene was deleted.

.0003
CHOLESTERYL ESTER STORAGE DISEASE
LIPA, GLY245TER

Aslanidis et al. (1996) determined that the patient of Klima et al.
(1993) with cholesteryl ester storage disease (278000) was compound
heterozygous for a G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 836 in exon 7 of
the LIPA gene, resulting in substitution of gly245 with a termination
codon (G245X), and a splice site mutation resulting in skipping of exon
8 (613497.0002). The allele carrying the G245X mutation also carried the
L179P mutation (613497.0001). Aslanidis et al. (1996) concluded that
although the L179P mutation is believed to abolish the enzymatic
activity of the lysosomal acid lipase, it is the G245X mutation, through
its production of an unstable mRNA, that was responsible for the low
level of transcript (approximately 6% of wildtype) derived from the
paternal allele.

.0004
WOLMAN DISEASE
CHOLESTERYL ESTER STORAGE DISEASE, INCLUDED
LIPA, 1-BP INS, 634T

In a proband with Wolman disease (278000), Anderson et al. (1994) found
compound heterozygosity for insertion of a T nucleotide after nucleotide
634 in exon 6 of the LIPA gene, and a substitution of proline at
leucine-179 (613497.0001). The 634T insertion occurred at the end of a
run of 6 Ts and led to premature termination 12 amino acids downstream.
Anderson et al. (1994) also found this mutation in a proband and parent
from 1 of 11 unrelated CESD families examined.

.0005
WOLMAN DISEASE
LIPA, IVS8, G-A, +1

In 2 sibs with Wolman disease (278000) from a consanguineous family,
Aslanidis et al. (1996) detected homozygosity for a G-to-A mutation at
position +1 of the splice donor site following exon 8 of the LIPA gene.
Both children died within the first year of life. The parents, who were
heterozygous for the mutation, had reduced enzymatic activity, while no
enzymatic activity was detectable in fibroblasts from the affected
children. Although the same donor splice site is involved as in the
mutation reported in CESD (934G-A, 613497.0002), the nucleotide at
position +1 was changed in the Wolman disease mutation while the
nucleotide at position -1 was changed in the CESD mutation. Both
mutations result in deletion of the same 24 amino acids (exon 8), but
the effects are dramatically different: the -1 mutation allowed some
correct splicing (3% of total LIPA RNA), but the +1 splice site
mutation, which affects one of the invariable nucleotides of the splice
consensus sequences, permits no correct splicing. Aslanidis et al.
(1996) suggested that the residual activity in CESD patients compared to
Wolman patients may result either from a partially active enzyme with
the internal deletion of 24 amino acids (skipping of exon 8) or from the
production of low amounts of the full size of the protein due to
inefficient exon exclusion from the mutated allele.

.0006
WOLMAN DISEASE
LIPA, TYR22TER

In a Japanese patient with Wolman disease (278000), Fujiyama et al.
(1996) identified a tyr22-to-ter (Y22X) mutation of the LIPA gene. The
female patient had an umbilical cord herniation at birth. At about 30
days after birth, she showed abdominal distention with
hepatosplenomegaly and frequent episodes of diarrhea and vomiting.
Abdominal computed tomography revealed massive hepatosplenomegaly and
enlargement of the adrenal glands with calcification. Anemia and hepatic
failure progressed rapidly and she died at age 114 days. The parents
were first cousins. An older sister had died with similar symptoms 80
days after birth.

.0007
WOLMAN DISEASE
LIPA, 1-BP DEL, 482A

In an infant, born of unrelated parents, with Wolman disease (278000),
Lee et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (482delA) in
exon 5 of the LIPA gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature
truncation at residue 179. The mutation, which was inherited from the
unaffected father, was not found in 200 controls chromosomes. The other
allele, inherited from the unaffected mother, carried an intragenic
deletion of the LIPA gene including intron 3 and part of exon 4; both
the patient and mother had only 1 copy of exon 4. The patient presented
at age 6 weeks with abdominal distention and failure to thrive. He had
hepatosplenomegaly and calcified adrenals; LIPA activity was
undetectable. He died of multiorgan failure within the following month.

606523	TITLE *606523 SLIT-ROBO RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 1; SRGAP1
;;SLIT-ROBO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN, RHO, 1;;
SLIT-ROBO GAP1;;
KIAA1304;;
ARHGAP13
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening brain cDNA libraries for sequences with the potential to
encode large proteins, Nagase et al. (2000) identified a cDNA they
called KIAA1304. The 1,051-amino acid KIAA1304 protein is 48% identical
to C1 RHOGAP (300023) and 68% identical to KIAA0456 (606524). It was
predicted to be involved in cell signaling/communication. RT-PCR
analysis detected moderate expression of KIAA1304 in all tissues tested
except skeletal muscle, pancreas, and spleen, where expression was low.
KIAA1304 was expressed in all brain regions tested.

The SLIT proteins (e.g., SLIT1; 603742) guide neuronal and leukocyte
migration through the Roundabout transmembrane receptors (e.g., ROBO1;
602430). Using a yeast 2-hybrid system to search for proteins
interacting with a C-terminal region (amino acids 1455 to 1657) of rat
Robo1, Wong et al. (2001) isolated 20 positive clones from a mouse brain
cDNA library. Eight of these clones encode a novel family of Rho
GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that the authors termed SRGAPs. The
mouse Srgap1, Srgap2, and Srgap3 proteins correspond to the human
KIAA1304, KIAA0456, and KIAA0411 (606525) proteins, respectively. The
SRGAPs contain an FCH domain, a RHOGAP domain, and an SH3 domain. The
FCH domain in SRGAP1 (amino acids 11 to 110) is similar to the FCH
domains of SRGAP2, SRGAP3, C1 RHOGAP, CDC15, and FER (176942). The
centrally located RHOGAP domain in SRGAP1 (amino acids 483 to 657) is
highly similar to the RHOGAP domains of SRGAP2, SRGAP3, and C1 RHOGAP.
The SH3 domain in SRGAP1 (amino acids 712 to 767) is similar to those in
SRGAP2, SRGAP3, C1 RHOGAP, and CSK (124095). Northern blot analysis
detected SRGAP1 transcripts of 8.0, 5.5, and 3.8 kb in all tissues
tested, with the 8.0-kb transcript being the most abundant. Western blot
analysis revealed a 130-kD SRGAP1 protein expressed at high levels in
brain, lung, and spleen. In situ hybridization of rodent tissues showed
that Srgap1 and Srgap2 are expressed in regions responsive to Slit.

GENE FUNCTION

Wong et al. (2001) found that SLIT increased SRGAP1-ROBO1 interaction
and inactivated CDC42 (116952). A dominant-negative SRGAP1 blocked SLIT
inactivation of CDC42 and SLIT repulsion of migratory cells from the
anterior subventricular zone of the forebrain. A constitutively active
CDC42 blocked the repulsive effect of SLIT. These results demonstrated
important roles for GAPs and CDC42 in neuronal migration.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
KIAA1304 gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP stSG4553).

604409	TITLE *604409 GLUCOCORTICOID MODULATORY ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 1; GMEB1
;;PARVOVIRUS INITIATION FACTOR, p96 SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using heat-shock protein-27 (HSP27; 602195) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
assay, Theriault et al. (1999) cloned a human cDNA encoding a deduced
573-amino acid protein that they called glucocorticoid modulatory
element-binding protein-1 (GMEB1). The GMEB1 protein has a KDWK domain,
contains sequences that are 95% identical to 3 tryptic peptides of rat
GMEB1, and shares 38% identity with rat GMEB2. A rabbit antibody raised
against a recombinant GMEB1 fusion protein detected an 85-kD polypeptide
in several human and mouse cell lines, in rat liver, and in different
mouse tissues. The authors suggested that the difference between the
apparent molecular mass of this polypeptide and the calculated molecular
mass of 62.5-kD derived from the protein sequence might reflect the high
content of acidic residues in GMEB1. By immunofluorescence of HeLa cells
expressing recombinant GMEB1, the authors localized the protein to the
nucleus. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the in vivo
interaction of HSP27 with GMEB1. GMEB1 translated in reticulocyte
lysates bound to 21-bp GME oligonucleotides in a gel-shift assay. The
resulting complex was similar in size to the complex obtained using rat
liver nucleotide extracts. Both complexes were supershifted with an
antibody specific to human GMEB1. The authors concluded that GMEB1 is a
trans-acting DNA-binding protein that may mediate the demonstrated
functions of GME as a positive modulator of the glucocorticoid response.

Christensen et al. (1999) copurified GMEB1 in a complex with GMEB2
(607451) from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Using degenerate primers
designed from the amino acid sequence followed by 5-prime and 3-prime
RACE, they cloned the full-length cDNAs. The deduced GMEB1 protein,
which they called p96, contains 563 amino acids and has a calculated
molecular mass of 60.4 kD. By SDS/PAGE analysis, the apparent molecular
mass was 96 kD. GMEB1 contains an N-terminal KDWK domain, and a highly
acidic C terminus that likely forms a coiled-coil structure. Recombinant
and endogenous GMEB1 share identical mobilities when analyzed by
SDS/PAGE analysis, indicating a lack of posttranslational modification.
Within the N-terminal KDWK domain, GMEB1 shares about 80% identity with
GMEB2; overall, they share about 40% identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Christensen et al. (1999) noted that the complex of GMEB1 and GMEB2,
which they designated parvovirus initiation factor (PIF) subunits p96
and p79, respectively, was originally recognized as a site-specific
DNA-binding complex essential for parvovirus DNA replication.
Christensen et al. (1999) found that GMEB2 and GMEB1 self-associate when
expressed alone, and that they form heterodimers when expressed
together. Cross-linking experiments indicated that no higher-order
multimers were formed. Each protein was active in promoter activation
assays, and the complex bound regulatory elements within the promoter
regions of tyrosine animotransferase (613018) and the transferrin
receptor gene (190010). Within its recognition site, PIF coordinately
bound 2 copies of the tetranucleotide PuCGPy, and these could be spaced
from 1 to 15 nucleotides apart.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GMEB1
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG1681R).

148060	TITLE *148060 KERATIN 8; KRT8
;;K8;;
CYTOKERATIN 8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Keratin 8 is a type II keratin (Moll et al., 1982). Endo A is the mouse
equivalent. Endo B, which is the equivalent of human keratin 18
(148070), a type I keratin, is coexpressed with Endo A; the 2 appear to
be the first intermediate filament (IF) proteins expressed during murine
development (Jackson et al., 1980). Yamamoto et al. (1990) studied a
full-length cDNA for cytokeratin 8 from placenta. They determined the
distribution of cytokeratin 8 mRNA in various fetal tissues and in
placentae of different gestational ages.

Krauss and Franke (1990) cloned cytokeratin 8 from a genomic library.
The 485-amino acid protein deduced from the exon sequences has a
calculated molecular mass of about 53.5 kD. CK8 shows strong homology
with the corresponding bovine, mouse, and Xenopus proteins. The human
and mouse CK8 share about 82% identity in the N-terminal head domain,
95% identity in the alpha helical rod domain, and 67.5% identity in the
C-terminal tail.

GENE FUNCTION

He et al. (2002) presented evidence that soluble depolymerized K8
subunits were phosphorylated on ser73 by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1;
601158) upon stimulation of the proapoptotic cytokine receptor Fas
(134637) in colon carcinoma cells. K8 was also phosphorylated following
exposure to ultraviolet light. Coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated
that JNK interacted directly with K8, and K8 was able to sequester a
substantial amount of the 54-kD isoform of JNK. The association of JNK
with K8 correlated with the decreased ability of JNK to phosphorylate
endogenous c-Jun (see 165160). He et al. (2002) hypothesized that K8
phosphorylation could regulate JNK signaling and/or keratin dynamics. Ku
et al. (2002) reported the phosphorylation of K8 ser73 by p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK14; 600289). p38 MAPK associated
with K8/K18 complexes in transfected baby hamster kidney cells,
phosphorylated K8 on ser73, and bound specifically to K8 in vitro. Ku et
al. (2002) noted that the leu160-to-pro mutation in K1 (139350.0002)
leads to epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (113800). The comparable mutation
in K8 resulted in hyperphosphorylation of K8 due to neophosphorylation
of ser70 in addition to phosphorylation of ser73, and keratin filament
collapse in the presence of okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krauss and Franke (1990) determined that the CK8 gene contains 8 exons
instead of 9 as is found in all other type II cytokeratins due to lack
of intron 5, and the gene spans over 8.8 kb. The 5-prime flanking region
contains a TATA box, 1 SP1 (189906) motif, and an Alu-like sequence in
an orientation opposite that of the CK8 gene. Intron 1 is long (about
2.5 kb) and contains 3 SP1 sites, 1 AP1 (see 165160) site, and another
Alu element in the same orientation as CK8.

MAPPING

Keratins 8 and 18 of simple epithelia differ from the keratins of
stratified epithelia in tissue expression and regulation. Using PCR to
study DNAs from somatic cell hybrids, Waseem et al. (1990) located a
single active gene for keratin 8 on chromosome 12. This chromosome
contains several genes for type II keratins and also the gene for
keratin 18, the type I keratin that is coexpressed with keratin 8. This
location of both members of a keratin pair on a single chromosome is
unique among keratin genes; it is consistent with the hypothesis that
keratins 8 and 18 may be closer to an ancestral gene than the keratins
of more highly differentiated epithelia.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

About 10% of patients who undergo liver transplantation have cryptogenic
liver disease. In animal models, the absence of heteropolymeric keratins
8 and 18 or the presence of mutant keratins in hepatocytes causes or
promotes liver disease. Ku et al. (1997) demonstrated a germline
mutation in keratin 18 (148070.0001) in 1 of 28 patients with
cryptogenic cirrhosis (see 215600). Of 55 patients with cryptogenic
liver disease screened by Ku et al. (2001), 5 unrelated patients had
mutations in the keratin 8 gene that appeared to have predisposed them
to the disease. Three patients had a gly61-to-cys mutation at a highly
conserved glycine (148060.0001), and the other 2 had a tyr53-to-his
mutation (148060.0002). These mutations were not detected in patients
with other forms of liver disease or in randomly selected patients. In
transfected cells, the gly61-to-cys mutation limited keratin filament
reorganization when the cells were exposed to oxidative stress. In
contrast, the tyr53-to-his mutation destabilized keratin filaments when
transfected cells were exposed to heat or okadaic acid stress.

Following up on the observation that KRT8 and KRT18 mutations are found
in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, Ku et al. (2003) investigated
the role of keratin mutations in noncryptogenic cirrhosis and the
incidence of keratin mutations in the general population. The results
suggested that K8 and K18 are likely susceptibility genes for developing
both cryptogenic and noncryptogenic forms of liver disease. They studied
314 liver explants of patients who primarily had noncryptogenic
cirrhosis and compared the results with 349 blood bank volunteers. Seven
unique K8/K18 mutations were found in 11 independent patients with
biliary atresia, hepatitis B/C, alcoholism, primary biliary cirrhosis,
and fulminant hepatitis. Seven of the 11 patients had mutations
previously described in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis: gly61 to
cys (148060.0001), tyr53 to his (148060.0002), and his127 to leu
(148070.0001). Of the 349 blood bank control samples, only 1 contained
the tyr53-to-his mutation and 1 the gly61-to-cys mutation. Livers with
keratin mutations had cytoplasmic filamentous deposits that were less
frequent in livers without the mutations (P = 0.03).

ANIMAL MODEL

Casanova et al. (1999) generated mice expressing the human KRT8 gene,
leading to a moderate increase in the content of keratin in simple
epithelia. These mice displayed progressive exocrine pancreas
alterations, including dysplasia and loss of acinar architecture,
redifferentiation of acinar to ductal cells, inflammation, fibrosis, and
substitution of exocrine by adipose tissue, as well as increased cell
proliferation and apoptosis. The phenotype was very similar to that
reported for transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative mutant
TGF-beta type II receptor (TGFBR2; 190182). Casanova et al. (1999)
showed that these Tgfbr2 mutant mice also had elevated KRT8/KRT18
levels. The results indicated that simple epithelial keratins play a
relevant role in the regulation of exocrine pancreas homeostasis and
supported the idea that disruption of mechanisms that normally regulate
keratin expression in vivo could be related to inflammatory and
neoplastic pancreatic disorders.

Jaquemar et al. (2003) determined that the lethality seen in genetically
sensitive K8-null mouse embryos is due to disruption of the trophoblast
giant cell layer that normally forms a barrier between the maternal and
embryonic compartments. Massive hemorrhages of maternal blood were found
between the decidua capsularis and the parietal yolk sac. Maternal tumor
necrosis factor (TNF; 191160) and TNF receptor (see 191190) contributed
to the lethality.

614601	TITLE *614601 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 326; ZNF326
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN INTERACTING WITH NUCLEAR MESSENGER RIBONUCLEOPROTEINS
AND DBC1; ZIRD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZNF326 is a subunit of a protein complex that regulates alternative mRNA
splicing (Close et al., 2012).

CLONING

By mass spectrometric analysis of proteins that copurified with
messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles from HEK293 cells, Close et
al. (2012) identified ZNF326, which they called ZIRD. By SDS-PAGE, ZIRD
had an apparent molecular mass of about 95 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Close et al. (2012) identified ZIRD and DBC1 (KIAA1967; 607359) as
subunits of an approximately 800-kD protein complex that they named the
ZIRD-DBC1 (DBIRD) complex. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis of transfected
HEK293 cells revealed that ZIRD and DBC1 interacted directly. The 2
proteins also interacted directly with RNA polymerase II (see POLR2A;
180660) and with mRNPs, although the interaction with mRNPs depended
upon the presence of RNA. Depletion of ZIRD via RNA interference led to
increased exon inclusion in more than 2,800 cases, whereas exon
exclusion was observed in only 390 cases. Depletion of DBC1 led to exon
inclusion in 796 cases, most of which were also observed following ZIRD
depletion. The effect of ZIRD or DBC1 depletion occurred at the level of
alternative splicing. RNA immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that
the DBIRD complex bound to relevant exons in mRNAs from 7 tested genes.
The exons affected by DBIRD tended to be AT rich. Depletion of either
DBC1 or ZIRD slowed the rate of transcript elongation and RNA polymerase
II density. Close et al. (2012) concluded that the DBIRD complex affects
the efficiency of splicing, possibly by facilitating transcript
elongation across AT-rich regions and favoring exon inclusion.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the ZNF326 gene to chromosome 1p22.2 based on an
alignment of the ZNF326 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC014899) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RNASEH2C gene encodes subunit C of the human ribonuclease H2 enzyme
complex which cleaves ribonucleotides from RNA:DNA duplexes. See also
RNASEH2A (606034) and RNASEH2B (610326).

CLONING

The RNASEH2C gene encodes a 164-amino acid protein (Crow et al., 2006).

GENE STRUCTURE

The RNASEH2C gene contains 4 exons (Crow et al., 2006).

MAPPING

The RNASEH2C gene maps to chromosome 11q13.2 (Crow et al., 2006).

GENE FUNCTION

By transient expression in HEK293T cells, Crow et al. (2006) showed that
the human RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, and RNASEH2C genes interact with each
other and form an enzymatic protein complex with RNase H2 activity. The
complex was able to recognize and cleave a single ribonucleotide
embedded in a DNA-DNA complex.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 5 Pakistani families with Aicardi-Goutieres
syndrome-3 (AGS3; 610329), Crow et al. (2006) identified a homozygous
mutation in the RNASH2C gene (610330.0001). Haplotype analysis suggested
a founder effect. Affected members of a Pakistani family carried another
homozygous mutation (610330.0002).

In affected members of 5 consanguineous Pakistani families with
Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome-3 (610329), Crow et al. (2006) identified a

601546	TITLE *601546 PROSPERO-RELATED HOMEOBOX 1; PROX1
;;HOMEOBOX GENE PROX1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zinovieva et al. (1996) described the isolation of a human gene that is
homologous to the mouse Prox1 homeotic gene. PCR probes corresponding to
the mouse Prox1 gene were used to screen human genomic DNA libraries.
PCR probes corresponding to human PROX1 cDNA were used to screen fetal
brain cDNA libraries. Comparison of the human and chicken PROX1
nucleotide sequence demonstrated that they are highly conserved, with
overall homology of 94%. In the region of the homeodomain and the
prospero domain, the genes were identical. The prospero domain coincides
with a domain in a Drosophila gene that is expressed in Drosophila
central nervous system and in the developing lens-secreting cone cells
of the eye. Exon 1 of the human sequence showed no clear similarity to
the 3 alternatively spliced variants of chicken PROX1 cDNA. Human PROX1
exon 1 was found to contain repetitive sequences. Analysis of mRNA
revealed that Prox mRNA was present in many different human tissues and
that lens demonstrated the highest level. In all tissues but lens, PROX1
cDNA hybridized to a single band of 8 kb. In the embryonic lens an
additional component of 2 kb was present which appears to be derived by
alternative splicing. Zinovieva et al. (1996) noted that since the cDNA
isolated by them was only 2,924 bp and the mRNA transcript was 8.0 kb,
significant portions of the 5-prime and 3-prime untranslated regions of
the cDNA remained uncloned.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using combined analysis of cDNA and genomic DNA clones, Zinovieva et al.
(1996) found that the PROX1 gene is composed of at least 5 exons and 4
introns.

MAPPING

Zinovieva et al. (1996) mapped the PROX1 gene to chromosome 1 by
analysis of somatic cell hybrids. They also reported that the PROX1 gene
maps within a YAC contig that maps to chromosome 1q32.2-q32.3. Zinovieva
et al. (1996) reported that Usher syndrome type II (276901) maps close
to this region on chromosome 1 and that PROX1 can be considered as a
candidate gene for this disorder.

GENE FUNCTION

Wigle and Oliver (1999) reported that the Prox1 gene is expressed in a
subpopulation of endothelial cells that by budding and sprouting give
rise to the lymphatic system. The initial localization of these cells in
the veins and their subsequent budding were both polarized, suggesting
that unidentified guidance signals regulate this process. In Prox1-null
mice, budding and sprouting were arrested, although vasculogenesis and
angiogenesis of the vascular system were unaffected. These findings
suggested that Prox1 is a specific and required regulator of the
development of the lymphatic system and that the vascular and lymphatic
systems develop independently.

Several genes are required during the early phases of liver
specification, proliferation, and differentiation. Sosa-Pineda et al.
(2000) reported that Prox1 is required for hepatocyte migration in the
mouse. Loss of Prox1 led to formation of a smaller liver with a reduced
population of clustered hepatocytes surrounded by a laminin-rich basal
membrane.

Retinal progenitor cells regulate their proliferation during development
so that the correct number of each cell type is made at the appropriate
time. Dyer et al. (2003) found that the homeodomain protein Prox1
regulates the exit of progenitor cells from the cell cycle in the
embryonic mouse retina. Cells lacking Prox1 are less likely to stop
dividing, and ectopic expression of Prox1 forces progenitor cells to
exit the cell cycle. Other observations indicated that Prox1 activity is
both necessary and sufficient for progenitor-cell proliferation and
cell-fate determination in the vertebrate retina.

Francois et al. (2008) demonstrated that Sox18 (601618) acts as a
molecular switch to induce differentiation of lymphatic endothelial
cells. Sox18 is expressed in a subset of cardinal vein cells that later
coexpress Prox1 and migrate to form lymphatic vessels. Sox18 directly
activates Prox1 transcription by binding to its proximal promoter.

Johnson et al. (2008) showed that differentiation of lymphatic
endothelial cells in mice is a plastic and reprogrammable process that
depends on constant Prox1 activity. Small interfering RNA-mediated
downregulation of Prox1 in cultured lymphatic endothelial cells or
conditional downregulation of Prox1 during embryonic, postnatal, or
adult stages was sufficient to reprogram lymphatic endothelial cells
into blood endothelial cells.

Kazenwadel et al. (2010) identified a microRNA-181 (MIR181; see
612742)-binding sequence that was 100% conserved in the 3-prime ends of
human, mouse, rat, and chicken PROX1 transcripts. Mouse Mir181a bound
the 3-prime sequence of Prox1, inhibited its translation, and caused its
degradation. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis
showed reciprocal expression of Mir181a and Prox1 in embryonic mouse
lens and retina and in adult and embryonic blood and lymphatic
endothelial cells. Overexpression of Mir181a in embryonic lymphatic
endothelial cells caused degradation of Prox1 mRNA, reducing Prox1
protein expression and causing reprogramming of lymphatic endothelial
cells toward a blood vascular phenotype. Conversely, treatment of
primary embryonic blood vascular endothelial cells with an Mir181a
antagomir increased Prox1 mRNA levels. Kazenwadel et al. (2010)
concluded that MIR181A has a role in embryonic vascular development by
controlling PROX1 gene expression.

ANIMAL MODEL

The expression pattern of the Prox1 homeobox gene suggests that it has a
role in a variety of embryonic tissues, including lens. To analyze the
requirement for Prox1 during mammalian development, Wigle et al. (1999)
inactivated the locus in mice. Homozygous Prox1-null mice died at
midgestation from multiple developmental defects. Wigle et al. (1999)
described a specific effect on lens development. Prox1 inactivation
caused abnormal cellular proliferation, downregulated expression of the
cell cycle inhibitors Cdkn1b (600778) and Cdkn1c (600856), misexpression
of E-cadherin (192090), and inappropriate apoptosis. Consequently,
mutant lens cells failed to polarize and elongate properly, resulting in
a hollow lens. The data provided evidence that the progression of
terminal fiber differentiation and elongation is dependent on Prox1
activity during lens development.

Multiple organs cooperate to regulate appetite, metabolism, and glucose
and fatty acid homeostasis. Harvey et al. (2005) identified and
characterized lymphatic vasculature dysfunction as a cause of
adult-onset obesity. They found that functional inactivation of a single
allele of the homeobox gene Prox1 in mice led to adult-onset obesity due
to abnormal lymph leakage from mispatterned and ruptured lymphatic
vessels. They proposed that Prox1 heterozygous mice are a model for
adult-onset obesity and lymphatic vascular disease. They proposed that
there is crosstalk between the lymphatic vasculature and adipose tissue.
They proposed a model in which lymph linkage promotes adipose tissue
accumulation in 2 phases: first, increased storage of leaking lipids in
existing adipocytes causes adipocyte hypertrophy; and second, once the
adipocytes reach maximum lipid storage capacity, the promotion of
preadipocyte differentiation results in adipocyte hyperplasia in older
and more obese mice. Harvey et al. (2005) suggested that in the human,
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes associated with
lymphatic development could predispose individuals to adult-onset
obesity.

602835	TITLE *602835 GROWTH ARREST-SPECIFIC 2; GAS2
DESCRIPTION Schneider et al. (1988) identified a group of genes that are highly
expressed during growth arrest in murine fibroblasts. Brancolini et al.
(1992) characterized one of those genes, Gas2. Using immunofluorescence,
they found that Gas2 is a component of the microfilament system. Gas2
colocalizes with actin fibers at the cell border and along the stress
fibers in growth-arrested mouse fibroblasts. On Western blots of both
human and mouse fibroblast extracts, antibodies against Gas2 recognized
a 36-kD protein. By screening a human kidney library with a fragment of
the mouse Gas2 cDNA, Collavin et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding
human GAS2. The predicted 313-amino acid human protein differs in only 8
residues from mouse Gas2. When expressed in mammalian cells, human GAS2
localized at the actin cytoskeleton, along the stress fibers and at the
plasma membrane. Like the mouse protein, GAS2 is proteolytically cleaved
in apoptotic cells. Using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, Collavin et
al. (1998) determined that GAS2 was expressed in most of the tissues
analyzed, with the highest levels of protein found in liver, lung, and
kidney.

Colombo et al. (1992) showed that the Gas2 gene is linked to markers on
mouse chromosome 7. By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by
analysis of a radiation hybrid panel, Collavin et al. (1998) mapped the
human GAS2 gene to 11p15.2-p14.3, a region that has homology of synteny
with mouse chromosomal band 7C.

;;UNACTIVE PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR, 23-KD; P23;;
PROSTAGLANDIN E SYNTHASE, CYTOSOLIC; CPGES
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

P23 was first observed as a component of the unactivated avian
progesterone receptor complex, along with HSP70 (see 140550) and HSP90
(see 140571) (Smith et al., 1990). Using the chicken p23 sequence as
probe, Johnson et al. (1994) cloned P23 from a human testis cDNA
library. The deduced 160-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 19 kD and contains several putative phosphorylation sites.
P23 shares about 96% sequence identity with the chicken homolog. Western
blot analysis revealed a 23-kD band in tissue and cell lysates from
several mammalian species including human.

GENE FUNCTION

Freeman and Yamamoto (2002) determined that the P23 molecular chaperone
localizes to genomic response elements in a hormone-dependent manner and
showed that it could disrupt receptor-mediated transcriptional
activation.

Synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from arachidonic acid involves
multiple enzymes, and 2 isoforms of the terminal enzyme of this
biosynthetic pathway, PGE synthase (PGES), have been identified.
Cytosolic PTGES (cPGES) is identical to the heat-shock protein-90 (see
140571) chaperone p23 (Tanioka et al., 2000) and is functionally coupled
to constitutive prostaglandin-endoperoxide H synthase-1 (176805) (Han et
al., 2002). Microsomal PTGES (mPGES; 605172) is inducible by
proinflammatory cytokines such as IL1B (147720). Meadows et al. (2003)
studied expression and localization of both enzyme isoforms in human
fetal membranes either at term or preterm, with or without labor.
Western blot analysis of the amnion and choriodecidua showed no
differences in amounts of either cPGES or mPGES at term or preterm, with
or without labor, in either tissue with advancing gestation. Meadows et
al. (2003) concluded that expression of PGES is not the rate-limiting
step in PGE2 synthesis in fetal membranes at labor.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the P23
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP SHGC-35709).

610972	TITLE *610972 ADHERENS JUNCTION-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; AJAP1
;;SHREW1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display RT-PCR to identify cDNAs specific to invasive
versus noninvasive derivatives of an endometriotic cell line, followed
by database analysis and 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of a brain cDNA
library, Bharti et al. (2004) cloned AJAP1, which they called SHREW1.
The predicted 411-amino acid protein is highly alkaline and has a
calculated molecular mass of 43 kD. It contains an N-terminal signal
peptide, a transmembrane domain, and potential sites for
phosphorylation, glycosylation, and myristoylation. Database analysis
suggested that SHREW1 may be restricted to vertebrates. Northern blot
analysis of invasive endometriotic cells detected a 4-kb SHREW1
transcript. Immunoblot analysis of human pancreas and uterus revealed an
endogenous 48-kD SHREW1 protein. Epitope-tagged SHREW1 localized to the
basolateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells and colocalized with
E-cadherin (CDH1; 192090), a marker of adherens junctions.

GENE FUNCTION

Schreiner et al. (2007) found that overexpression of SHREW1 protein
enhanced invasiveness of human fibrosarcoma cells. SHREW1 interacted
with CD147 (BSG; 109480), a mediator of invasiveness and matrix
metalloprotease activity, in epithelial cells. Downregulation of SHREW1
or CD147 using small interfering RNA in HeLa cells decreased
invasiveness without affecting proliferation. Schreiner et al. (2007)
concluded that SHREW1-CD147 interaction is associated with regulation of
cellular invasion.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the AJAP1
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SGC32361).

615428	TITLE *615428 DEAD BOX POLYPEPTIDE 47; DDX47
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DDX47 is predicted to be an RNA helicase with a role in early ribosomal
biogenesis (Sekiguchi et al., 2006).

CLONING

Sekiguchi et al. (2006) cloned DDX47 by PCR of a human Burkitt lymphoma
cDNA library. The deduced 455-amino acid protein has a DEADc RNA
helicase domain in its N-terminal half, followed by a helicase
superfamily C-terminal (HELICc) domain. It also has an N-terminal
nuclear export signal and a C-terminal nuclear localization signal.
Fluorescence-tagged DDX47 colocalized with the nucleolar proteins NOP132
(NOL8; 611534) and KIAA0559 (NAP1; 608865) in nucleoli of transfected
HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analyses, Lee et al.
(2005) identified DDX47 as a binding partner of GABARAP (605125) in
human 2774 and SKOV-3 ovarian tumor cell lysates. Yeast 2-hybrid
analysis confirmed the interaction. Overexpression of either DDX47 or
GABARAP alone had no effect on proliferation of SKOV-3 cells; however,
their coexpression inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis.

Sekiguchi et al. (2006) characterized proteins that immunoprecipitated
with epitope-tagged NOP132 from human 293EBNA cells. Mass spectrometric
and database analysis identified DDX18 (606355) and DDX47, in addition
to many proteins from the large and small ribosomal subunits and
proteins previously characterized in human pre-ribosomal nucleoprotein
complexes. A similar complement of proteins immunoprecipitated with
DDX18 or DDX47. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed association
of NOP132 with DDX18 and DDX47, but not with other DDX proteins. RNase
treatment significantly decreased association of NOP132 with DDX18 and
DDX47, suggesting that their interaction depends on RNA. Similarly,
RNase treatment released most of the NOP132-, DDX18-, and
DDX47-associated proteins. Epitope-tagged DDX47 associated with several
rRNA precursors and with 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNA, suggesting that DDX47
is involved in early stages of pre-rRNA processing. Knockdown of NOP132
by small interfering RNA caused mislocalization of DDX47 to the
nucleolar periphery. Knockdown of either NOP132 or DDX47 decreased the
amount of mature rRNA and rRNA precursors. Mutation analysis revealed
that the coiled-coil region of NOP132 interacted with the HELICc motif
of DDX47. Sekiguchi et al. (2006) concluded that NOP132 is required for
proper targeting of DDX47 to the nucleolar organizing region, and that
DDX47 has a role in early ribosome biogenesis.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the DDX47 gene to chromosome 12p13.1 based on an
alignment of the DDX47 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF078843) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37). Sekiguchi et al. (2006)

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs; see 603478) are proteases that
specifically cleave ubiquitin (191339) linkages, negating the action of
ubiquitin ligases. DUBA8 belongs to a DUB subfamily characterized by an
ovarian tumor (OTU) domain.

Kayagaki et al. (2007) identified ovarian tumor domain (OTU)-containing
protein 2 (OTUD2) in a small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based screen for
OTU deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) family members. The 6,265-basepair
mRNA contains an open reading frame (ORF) predicting a 348-amino acid
protein. In addition to an OTU domain, the protein includes a zinc
finger (ZNF) C2H2 domain.

MAPPING

The YOD1 gene maps to chromosome 1q32.1 (Kayagaki et al., 2007).

602838	TITLE *602838 PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3-KINASE, CLASS 2, BETA; PIK3C2B
DESCRIPTION Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) phosphorylate the 3-prime OH position
of the inositol ring of inositol lipids. They have been shown to have
critical roles in signal transduction, cell transformation, and
intracellular protein trafficking. Three classes of PI3Ks can be
distinguished on the basis of their in vitro lipid substrate
specificity, sequence homology, and structural characteristics. The
class II PI3Ks phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol and
phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, but not phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate, and are defined by the presence of a C-terminal C2
domain. C2 domains act as calcium-dependent phospholipid binding motifs
that mediate translocation of proteins to membranes, and have also been
shown to mediate interactions between proteins.

Using RT-PCR of breast RNA with degenerate primers derived from
conserved motifs within the lipid kinase domain of PI3Ks, Brown et al.
(1997) isolated cDNAs encoding a protein that they designated HsC2-PI3K.
Sequence analysis revealed that the predicted 1,634-amino acid protein
is a PI3K that is most closely related to the class II PI3Ks. The C2
domain of HsC2-PI3K lacks 3 of 4 conserved aspartate residues implicated
in calcium binding, and therefore the authors considered it likely that
this C2 domain functions in a calcium-independent manner. Brown et al.
(1997) found by Northern blot analysis that HsC2-PI3K is expressed as an
8.5-kb transcript in various tissues, with the highest level of
expression in thymus and placenta.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Brown et al. (1997) mapped the
PIK3C2B gene to 1q32.

;;PAROTID SALIVARY GLYCOPROTEIN; G1;;
BASIC SALIVARY PROLINE-RICH PROTEIN, BstNI TYPE, 3
DESCRIPTION For background information on salivary proline-rich proteins, see PRB1
(180989).

Azen et al. (1978) found 5 alleles. Linkage with Pr, Db, and Pa was
indicated by linkage disequilibrium. These genes presumably arose by
gene duplication, in view of the structural similarity of the gene
products. They play an important role in inhibiting calcium phosphate
precipitation from saliva and the glycoprotein forms part of the
acquired dental pellicle and plaque. On the basis of relative degrees of
linkage disequilibrium, Azen and Denniston (1980) favored positioning of
G1 'outside' Db, to give suggested gene order Pa-Pr-Db-G1. Ikemoto et
al. (1979) delineated a polymorphic salivary glycoprotein they
symbolized Ph (salivary parotid heavy protein). The relation to G1 of
Azen et al. (1978) was not known. According to the hypothesis of Maeda
(1985), as outlined in 168730, 6 loci constituting 2 gene subfamilies
code the salivary proline-rich proteins. One subfamily, with 2 genes,
codes the acidic proteins; the genes are rich in HaeIII restriction
sites and are designated PRH1 and PRH2. The other subfamily, with 4
loci, codes the basic proteins; the genes are rich in BstNI restriction
sites and are designated PRB1, PRB2, PRB3, and PRB4. Maeda (1985)
concluded that the gene she designated PRB3 probably codes G1. Which
ones of the other basic proline-rich proteins are coded by PRB1, 2 and 4
is not yet certain. Sequencing and restriction mapping indicate that the
PRP cluster is in a segment of DNA about 500 kb long (Maeda, 1985).
There is no information on the order and linkage relationships of the 6
genes. The 2 genes PRH1 (168730) and PRH2 (168790) have been completely
sequenced (Kim and Maeda, 1986). The sequence information confirms the
allelic relationship of Db, Pa, and PIF.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PRB3S(CYS)
PRB3, ARG15CYS

In the saliva of an Ashkenazi Jew, Azen et al. (1990) established
compound heterozygosity for a null mutation and a missense mutation. The
missense mutation was a CGT-to-TGT (arg-to-cys) change at nucleotide 45
in the tandemly repetitious exon 3 (the major protein-coding portion).
Azen et al. (1990) referred to this missense mutation as the PRB3S(cys)
allele and concluded that it accounts for the disulfide-bonded and
peroxidase-modifying properties of the G1-8 variant. The G1-8 protein
variant was found in Ashkenazi Jews with a gene frequency of
approximately 0.008 but was not found in the general Caucasian, black,
or Japanese populations. Both G1-8, coded by the PRB3 locus, and Pa-1,
coded by the PRH1 locus, are disulfide bonded and probably modify
salivary peroxidase (part of an important intraoral antibacterial
system) through formation of disulfide-bonded heterodimers.

.0002
PRB3M(NULL)
PRB3, 1-BP INS

In the Ashkenazi Jew in whom Azen et al. (1990) found compound
heterozygosity for mutations at the PRB3 locus (see 168840.0001), one of
the alleles was identified as a null allele resulting from a single
nucleotide insertion that led to a frameshift and a premature
termination codon. Null alleles are frequent at PRP loci, apparently
because of an intragenic unequal crossover.

;;CD3 ANTIGEN, ZETA SUBUNIT; CD3Z;;
CD3-ZETA;;
T-CELL ANTIGEN RECEPTOR COMPLEX, ZETA SUBUNIT OF CD3; TCRZ
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Weissman et al. (1986) used an antiserum raised against the mouse zeta
subunit of the T-cell antigen receptor to identify a previously
unrecognized component of the human T-cell antigen receptor. This human
protein is T-cell specific and biochemically similar to the murine zeta
polypeptide, which has a molecular weight of 16K. The zeta chain, which,
like the epsilon chain, is nonglycosylated, exists in the T-cell
receptor molecule as a disulfide-linked homodimer.

Weissman et al. (1988) cloned a cDNA encoding the zeta chain of the
murine T-cell antigen receptor. The predicted protein sequence suggested
a structure distinct from those of any of the previously described
receptor subunits.

As indicated by Clevers et al. (1988), the T-cell receptor alpha/beta
and gamma/delta heterodimers are noncovalently associated with the
CD3-gamma (186740), -delta (186790), -epsilon (186830), and -zeta
proteins, together forming the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex. Weissman et
al. (1988) used the cDNA for the murine zeta gene as a probe to isolate
cDNAs encoding the human CD3Z gene. Comparison of the human and murine
genes showed a high degree of conservation, including conservation in
the nucleotide sequence of the 5-prime and 3-prime untranslated regions.
No significant sequence and structural homology was found, however, with
the previously characterized invariant delta, gamma, and epsilon chains
of the T-cell receptor.

GENE FUNCTION

The zeta chain of the T-cell antigen receptor plays an important role in
coupling antigen recognition to several intracellular
signal-transduction pathways. Caplan et al. (1995) presented evidence
that the zeta chain, while expressed on the T-cell surface, is
associated with the cytoskeletal matrix. A 42-amino acid region in the
intracytoplasmic domain of the zeta chain proved crucial for maximal
interaction between zeta chain and the cytoskeleton.

CD4 (186940) binds to relatively invariant sites on class II major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules outside the peptide-binding
groove, which interacts with the T-cell receptor (TCR). CD4 enhances
T-cell sensitivity to antigen and binds to LCK (153390), which
phosphorylates CD3Z. Instead of clustering in a cap at the interface
with an antigen-presenting cell (APC), some signaling molecules involved
in T-cell recognition segregate into distinct areas to form a SMAC
(supramolecular activation cluster), contributing to the immunologic
synapse (see Grakoui et al. (1999)). Using T-cell lines transfected with
green fluorescent protein-fused CD4 or CD3Z and 3-dimensional video
microscopy, Krummel et al. (2000) showed that in response to
peptide-loaded APC, CD3Z and CD4 initially cluster in the contact area
between the T cell and APC coincident with intracellular calcium
mobilization. Stable immunologic synapse formation was modulated by
peptide concentration and compromised by blocking the calcium increase
or cytoskeletal rearrangement. The authors determined that CD3Z remains
at the center of the interface while CD4 moves to the periphery.
Blocking with anti-TCR prevented CD3Z accumulation and inhibited calcium
mobilization. The data suggested that instead of stabilizing TCR-MHC
complexes, CD4 functions to initiate or augment the early phase of
T-cell activation.

MAPPING

The CD3Z gene was localized by Weissman et al. (1988) to the centromeric
region of chromosome 1 by study of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ
hybridization, emphasizing the fact that it is a distinct genetic
component of the T-cell receptor (the CD3D, CD3G, and CD3E genes are
clustered within 300 kb of each other on 11q23). The gene was assigned
to 1p22.1-q21.1. Baniyash et al. (1989) mapped the homologous gene in
the mouse to chromosome 1. Sturm et al. (1995) mapped the human OTF1
gene (164175) to 1q22-q23 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The
physical linkage of the CD3Z gene to the OTF1 transcription unit
indicates that CD3Z is also located at 1q22-q23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Rieux-Laucat et al. (2006) described a 4-month-old boy with primary
T-cell immunodeficiency (610163) who was found to have a homozygous
germline Q70X mutation in the CD3Z gene (186780.0001). CD3-zeta is
necessary for the development and function of T cells. Some of the
patient's T cells had low levels of the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex and
carried the Q70X mutation on both alleles of the CD3Z gene, whereas
other T cells had normal levels of the complex and bore the Q70X
mutation on only 1 allele of CD3Z, plus 1 of 3 heterozygous somatic
mutations of CD3Z on the other allele (186780.0002-186780.0004),
allowing expression of poorly functional T-cell receptor-CD3 complexes.
Thus the patient had both inherited and somatic CD3Z mutations as the
basis of the T-cell deficiency.

Rieux-Laucat et al. (2006) noted that the finding of somatic mutations
of a germline mutation in the CD3Z gene recalled somatic mutations of
germline mutations of the adenosine deaminase gene (608958), the
interleukin-2 receptor gamma-c gene (IL2RG; 308380), the
recombination-activating gene-1 (RAG1; 179615), the Wiskott-Aldrich
syndrome protein (301000), and the NEMO gene (300248). These somatic
changes could cause the mutant gene to revert to a wildtype gene or to a
sequence compatible with expression of the corresponding protein. In the
patient of Rieux-Laucat et al. (2006), these somatic mutations occurring
in the initially mutated codon were probably not due to a mutation
hotspot related to genomic instability, since these variants were not
found in other cell types from the patient. Furthermore, the T cells
with normal levels of the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex were polyclonal,
and each of the 3 somatic variants of CD3Z was found in different
populations of T cells, each with a distinct rearrangement of V(beta)
genes. This result indicated that the somatic mutations in CD3Z probably
occurred before the VDJ recombination process in T-cell progenitors. The
somatic mutations partially corrected the CD3Z deficiency, providing an
example of the modulation of T-cell immunodeficiency by somatic
mutations and of the selection of clones with such mutations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Class I MHC molecules, known to be important for immune responses to
antigen, are expressed also by neurons that undergo activity-dependent,
long-term structural and synaptic modifications. Huh et al. (2000)
showed that in mice genetically deficient for cell surface class I MHC,
due to deletion of either TAP1 (170260) or beta-2-microglobulin
(109700), or for the class I MHC receptor component CD3Z, refinement of
connections between retina and central targets during development is
incomplete. In the hippocampus of adult mutants, N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptor-dependent long-term potentiation is enhanced, and long-term
depression is absent. Specific class I MHC mRNAs are expressed by
distinct mosaics of neurons, reflecting a potential for diverse neuronal
functions. These results demonstrated an important role for these
molecules in the activity-dependent remodeling and plasticity of
connections in the developing and mature mammalian central nervous
system.

In mice chronically exposed to antigens of Porphyromonas gingivalis,
Bronstein-Sitton et al. (2003) observed that Ifng (147570)-dependent
Tcrz downregulation, due to lysosomal degradation, and impaired in vitro
T-cell function occurred in a way similar to that reported in a number
of infectious, autoimmune, and cancer pathologies. The in vitro findings
correlated with a deficient in vivo response, as assessed by reduced
immunity to influenza virus infection. Normal immune function and Tcrz
expression were regained after the cessation of chronic antigen
exposure.

By in situ hybridization of wildtype mouse retina, Xu et al. (2010)
showed that Cd3-zeta was preferentially expressed in the retinal
ganglion cell (RGC) layer. In Cd3-zeta -/- mice, the kinetics of RGC
dendritic elimination was markedly reduced, and the number of dendritic
protrusions was significantly increased during early postnatal
development. These defects could be mimicked in wildtype mice by
applying glutamate receptor (GLUR; see 138248) antagonists. Disruption
of RGC synaptic activity and dendritic motility was associated with a
failure of eye-specific segregation of RGC axon projections to the
central nervous system. Xu et al. (2010) concluded that CD3-zeta
regulates synaptic wiring and selectively impairs GLUR-mediated synaptic
activity in retina during development.

In a 4-month-old boy of Caribbean origin with primary T-cell
immunodeficiency (610163), Rieux-Laucat et al. (2006) identified
homozygosity for a gln70-to-stop (Q70X) nonsense mutation in the CD3Z
gene. The premature stop codon was located within the first ITAM domain,
immediately upstream from the first YXXL motif, precluding expression of
all ITAM motifs and thus any interaction with the tyrosine kinase ZAP70
(176947). The boy's mother was heterozygous for the Q70X mutation. The
patient's other T cells had normal levels of the CD3 complex and bore
the Q70X mutation on only 1 allele of CD3Z, plus 1 of 3 heterozygous
somatic mutations of CD3Z on the other allele, allowing expression of
poorly functional T-cell receptor-CD3 complexes. The heterozygous
somatic mutations of CD3Z were Q70W (186780.0002), Q70L (186780), and
Q70Y (186780).

609507	TITLE *609507 TOPOISOMERASE I-BINDING ARGININE/SERINE-RICH PROTEIN; TOPORS
;;p53-BINDING PROTEIN 3; P53BP3;;
LUN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using murine p53 (191170) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa
cell cDNA library, Zhou et al. (1999) obtained a partial cDNA encoding
TOPORS, which they called P53BP3. TOPORS is rich in serine and arginine
and contains a leucine zipper domain, 2 PEST sequences, a central basic
domain containing 2 potential bipartite nuclear localization signals,
and 2 C-terminal PEST sequences. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous but variable expression of a 5.0-kb transcript. Highest
expression was in testis, and lowest expression was in lung.
Fluorescence-labeled TOPORS localized to nuclear star-like clusters in
transfected HeLa cells.

Using the N-terminal 250 amino acids of topoisomerase I (TOP1; 126420)
as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, followed
by 5-prime RACE of leukemia cell mRNA, Haluska et al. (1999) cloned
TOPORS. They extended the 5-prime coding region reported by Zhou et al.
(1999) and determined that the full-length protein contains 1,045 amino
acids.

Using degenerate primers to amplify cDNAs encoding RING finger proteins
from human lung cDNA, followed by screening a lung cDNA library, Chu et
al. (2001) cloned TOPORS, which they designated LUN. The deduced
1,045-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 119 kD.
TOPORS contains an N-terminal PEST sequence, followed by a C3H4-type
RING finger domain, a leucine zipper coiled-coil region, 2 PEST
sequences, a nuclear localization signal, and 2 C-terminal PEST
sequences. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.8-kb transcript in brain,
kidney, liver, lung, spleen, pancreas, and skeletal muscle, and a 3.6-kb
transcript in heart and lung. Highest expression of TOPORS was in lung.
In situ hybridization of adult lung sections detected TOPORS in alveolar
epithelium and in some squamous and cuboidal cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Zhou et al. (1999) determined that a central
region of TOPORS containing the putative nuclear localization signal and
2 PEST sequences was required for interaction with p53. The leucine
zipper of TOPORS was dispensable for interaction with p53.

By coimmunoprecipitation assays of transfected HeLa cells, Haluska et
al. (1999) confirmed that TOPORS interacts with TOP1.

Chu et al. (2001) found that TOPORS had zinc-dependent DNA binding
activity. The region from amino acids 51 to 374 was responsible for DNA
binding. Chu et al. (2001) identified a palindromic DNA sequence that
bound TOPORS in the upstream regulatory region of the E-cadherin gene
(CDH1; 192090) and in 2 intervening regions of the talin gene (TLN1;
186745).

Rajendra et al. (2004) found that TOPORS functioned in vitro as an E3
ubiquitin ligase with the E2 enzymes UBCH5A (UBE2D1; 602961), UBCH5C
(UBE2D3; 602963), and UBCH6 (UBE2E1; 602916), but not with other E2
enzymes examined. A conserved tryptophan within the RING domain of
TOPORS was required for ubiquitination activity. In vitro and cellular
studies implicated p53 as a ubiquitination substrate for TOPORS. Similar
to MDM2 (164785), overexpression of TOPORS resulted in a
proteasome-dependent decrease in p53 protein expression in a human
osteosarcoma cell line.

GENE STRUCTURE

The TOPORS gene contains 3 exons and spans 13 kb (Haluska et al., 1999).

MAPPING

By FISH, Zhou et al. (1999) mapped the TOPORS gene to chromosome
12p12.1-p11.2. However, Chu et al. (2001) mapped the TOPORS gene by FISH
to chromosomes 9p21, a localization confirmed by the International
Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium (TMAP RH98974).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Chakarova et al. (2007) used a positional cloning approach to sequence
genes in the critical region on 9p21.1 linked to a form of autosomal
dominant retinitis pigmentosa with a distinct phenotype (RP31; 609923).
They identified a heterozygous 1-bp insertion in exon 3 of the TOPORS
gene in a Canadian family (609507.0001). In a small German family, a
2-bp deletion in exon 3 was associated with the characteristic phenotype
(609507.0002). Chakarova et al. (2007) commented that the ubiquitous
nature of TOPORS expression and a lack of mutant protein in patients was
highly suggestive of haploinsufficiency, rather than a dominant-negative
effect, as the molecular mechanism of the disease and made the clinical
phenotype amenable to rescue by somatic gene therapy.

158270	TITLE *158270 MOTILIN; MLN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Motilin, a 22-amino acid hormone synthesized by cells of the small
intestine, regulates interdigestive gastrointestinal contraction. Seino
et al. (1987) cloned a cDNA encoding the human motilin precursor from an
intestinal cDNA library. The predicted amino acid sequence indicated
that the motilin precursor consists of 115 amino acids and includes a
25-residue N-terminal signal peptide followed by the 22-amino acid
motilin sequence and a long, 68-residue C-terminal peptide.

Feighner et al. (1999) identified the motilin receptor (602885) in the
human gastrointestinal system and found that it is expressed in enteric
neurons of the human duodenum and colon.

By Northern blot analysis, Gasparini et al. (1994) detected high levels
of a 0.7-kb MLN mRNA transcript in cells containing cilia, including
bronchoepithelial cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Daikh et al. (1989) showed that the motilin gene consists of 5 exons
spanning approximately 9 kb of genomic DNA. Exon 1 encodes the 5-prime
untranslated portion of the motilin mRNA. Exons 2 and 3 encode the
signal peptide and the 22-amino acid motilin peptide.

MAPPING

By a combination of Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrids and in
situ hybridization, Fan et al. (1989) assigned the MLN gene to 6p21.2.

Gasparini et al. (1994) showed that MLN is tightly linked to the
HLA-DQ-alpha locus (HLA-DQA1; 146880). They excluded mutations in the
MLN gene as a cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia (CILD1; 244400) in a
family that had shown linkage to chromosome 6p21.

;;TYROSYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE, MITOCHONDRIAL;;
MT-TYRRS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a database for tRNA synthetases, Bonnefond et al. (2005)
identified YARS2, which they called MT-TYRRS. The deduced 477-amino acid
protein contains a 16-amino acid mitochondrial targeting signal and
catalytic site motifs characteristic of amino acid tRNA synthetases.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bonnefond et al. (2005) determined that the YARS2 gene contains 5 exons
and spans 8.6 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the YARS2
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP G35326). Riley et al. (2010) stated that the
YARS2 gene maps to chromosome 12p11.21.

GENE FUNCTION

Bonnefond et al. (2005) found that recombinant YARS2 aminoacylated
purified E. coli tRNA-tyr and in vitro transcribed human mitochondrial
tRNA-tyr (MTTY; 590100). Gel-filtration chromatography showed that
recombinant YARS2 formed dimers.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Paukstelis et al. (2008) determined a 4.5-angstrom resolution co-crystal
structure of the bacteriophage Twort orf142-I2 group I intron ribozyme
bound to splicing-active, carboxy-terminally truncated mitochondrial
tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase from Neurospora. The structure shows that the
group I intron binds across the 2 subunits of the homodimeric protein
with a newly evolved RNA-binding surface distinct from that which binds
tyrosine tRNA. This RNA binding surface provides an extended scaffold
for the phosphodiester backbone of the conserved catalytic core of the
intron RNA, allowing the protein to promote the splicing of a wide
variety of group I introns. The group I intron-binding surface includes
3 small insertions and additional structural adaptations relative to
nonsplicing bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases, indicating a multistep
adaptation for splicing function. Paukstelis et al. (2008) concluded
that the fungal mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases provide a unique
model system for studying how essential proteins in general, and
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in particular, can progressively acquire new
functions and evolve to bind multiple structurally related RNAs.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By genomewide linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing of
2 consanguineous Lebanese families with myopathy, lactic acidosis, and
sideroblastic anemia-2 (MLASA2; 613561), Riley et al. (2010) identified
a homozygous mutation in the YARS2 gene (F52L; 610957.0001). In vitro
functional expression assays showed that the mutant YARS2 protein had an
overall 9-fold loss of catalytic efficiency. The findings indicated that
the mutation resulted in reduced aminoacylation efficiency, causing a
defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis with a subsequent impairment
of mitochondrial respiratory activity.

In 3 patients from 2 consanguineous Lebanese families with mitochondrial
myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia-2 (MLASA2; 613561),
Riley et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 156C-G transversion in the
YARS2 gene, resulting in a phe52-to-leu (F52L) substitution in a
conserved region of the catalytic domain. Haplotype analysis suggested a
founder effect, but the mutation was not observed in 220 control
chromosomes, including 104 of Lebanese origin. Immunoblot analysis of
patient skeletal muscle showed slightly reduced levels of YARS2, as well
as reduced levels of mitochondrial-encoded protein subunits of
respiratory chain complexes, indicating a reduction in mitochondrial
protein synthesis. In vitro functional expression assays showed that the
mutant YARS2 protein had a 2-fold reduction in catalytic activity and a
reduction in affinity for tRNA-tyr, resulting in an overall 9-fold loss
of catalytic efficiency. The findings indicated that the mutation
resulted in reduced aminoacylation efficiency, causing a defect in
mitochondrial protein synthesis with a subsequent impairment of
mitochondrial respiratory activity.

;;WASP FAMILY, MEMBER 2;;
WASP FAMILY, VERPROLIN HOMOLOGY DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; WAVE2;;
SCAR, DICTYOSTELIUM, HOMOLOG OF, 2; SCAR2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The actin cytoskeleton plays critical roles in cell morphologic changes
and motility. Rho family small GTPases, such as Rho (see 165370), RAC
(see 602048), and CDC42 (116952), organize the actin cytoskeleton. Other
major players in actin-based motility are the 7 members of the ARP2/3
complex (see 604221). The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP;
301000), WASP-like (WASL; 605056), and WASF2 are among the downstream
effector molecules involved in the transmission of signals from tyrosine
kinase receptors and small GTPases to the actin cytoskeleton. WASF1
(605035) is also involved in actin reorganization, but its expression is
restricted to brain.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologs of WASF1 and by screening cDNA
libraries, Suetsugu et al. (1999) identified WASF2 and WASF3 (605068),
which they termed WAVE2 and WAVE3, respectively. The predicted 498-amino
acid WASF2 protein shares 48% amino acid identity with WASF1. Northern
blot analysis detected WASF2 expression in all tissues tested except
skeletal muscle, with strongest expression in placenta, lung, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using SDS-PAGE analysis, Suetsugu et al. (1999) showed that, like other
WASP family members, WASF2 binds actin through its C-terminal verprolin
homology (VPH) domain. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that
ectopically expressed WASF2 induces abnormal actin clusters. These actin
cluster formations were suppressed by deletion of the VPH domain of
WASF2.

Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP, or WASL) functions in
several intracellular events including filopodium formation, vesicle
transport, and movement of viruses, by stimulating rapid actin
polymerization through the ARP2/3 complex. N-WASP is regulated by the
direct binding of CDC42, which exposes the domain in N-WASP that
activates the ARP2/3 complex. The WASP-related protein WAVE functions in
RAC-induced membrane ruffling; however, RAC does not bind directly to
WAVE, raising the question of how WAVE is regulated by RAC. Miki et al.
(2000) demonstrated that IRSP53 (605475), a substrate for insulin
receptor with unknown function, is the 'missing link' between RAC and
WAVE2. Activated RAC binds to the N terminus of IRSP53, and the
C-terminal SH3 domain of IRSP53 binds to WAVE2 to form a trimolecular
complex. From studies of ectopic expression, Miki et al. (2000) found
that IRSP53 is essential for RAC to induce membrane ruffling, probably
because it recruits WAVE2, which stimulates actin polymerization
mediated by the ARP2/3 complex.

Suetsugu et al. (2003) observed that, following PDGF (see 190040)
stimulation, Wave2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts displayed
impaired peripheral ruffle formation, and Wave1-deficient fibroblasts
displayed impaired dorsal ruffle formation. Wave2, but not Wave1, was
essential for directed cell migration in the absence of extracellular
matrix (ECM), when cells migrated with peripheral ruffles at the leading
edge. In contrast, both Wave1 and Wave2 were essential for invading
migration into ECM, suggesting that the leading edge in ECM has
characteristics of both ruffles. In dorsal ruffles, Wave1 colocalized
with ECM-degrading enzyme Mmp2 (120360), which was required for
Wave1-dependent migration, but not Wave2-dependent migration.

Oikawa et al. (2004) determined that mouse Wave2 contains an N-terminal
inositol phosphate-binding domain. Expression of a full-length Wave2
mutant lacking lipid-binding activity inhibited proper formation of
lamellipodia in mouse fibroblasts.

MAPPING

Suetsugu et al. (1999) stated that the WASF2 gene maps to Xp11.21, near
the WASP gene at Xp11.22. Scott (2001) mapped the WASF2 gene to
chromosome 1p36.11-p34.3 based on sequence similarity between the WASF2
sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB026542) and the chromosome 1 clone RP1-144C9
(GenBank GENBANK AL096774). The related sequence on the X chromosome may
be a pseudogene.

ANIMAL MODEL

By a targeted gene disruption, Yamazaki et al. (2003) generated mice
deficient in Wave2, which is expressed predominantly in vascular
endothelial cells during embryogenesis. Wave2 null embryos showed
hemorrhages and died at approximately embryonic day 10. Deficiency in
Wave2 had no significant effect on vasculogenesis, but it decreased
sprouting and branching of endothelial cells from existing vessels
during angiogenesis. In Wave2 null endothelial cells, cell polarity
formed in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (192240), but
the formation of lamellipodia at leading edges and capillaries was
severely impaired. Yamazaki et al. (2003) concluded that WAVE2-regulated
actin reorganization might be required for proper cell movement and that
a lack of functional WAVE2 impairs angiogenesis in vivo.

607698	TITLE *607698 LIGAND-DEPENDENT NUCLEAR RECEPTOR COREPRESSOR; LCOR
;;MBLK1-RELATED PROTEIN 2; MLR2;;
KIAA1795
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LCOR is a transcriptional corepressor widely expressed in fetal and
adult tissues that is recruited to agonist-bound nuclear receptors
through a single LxxLL motif, also referred to as a nuclear receptor
(NR) box (Fernandes et al., 2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned LCOR, which they called KIAA1795.
The deduced KIAA1795 protein contains 572 amino acids. RT-PCR followed
by ELISA detected highest expression in liver, testis, and ovary,
followed by kidney and brain. Within brain, highest expression was
detected in amygdala, corpus callosum, and caudate nucleus.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a fetal kidney cDNA library using the
ligand-binding domain of ESR1 (133430) as bait, followed by screening a
prostate cDNA library and searching EST databases, Fernandes et al.
(2003) cloned LCOR. The predicted 433-amino acid LCOR protein has a
calculated molecular mass of approximately 47 kD. It contains an LxxLL
motif, a nuclear localization signal, and a helix-loop-helix domain.
Northern blot analysis detected broad expression of LCOR transcripts at
varying levels in human adult and fetal tissues, with highest expression
in placenta, cerebellum and corpus callosum of brain, adult kidney, and
a number of fetal tissues.

Kunieda et al. (2003) cloned mouse Lcor, which they called Mlr2, based
on its homology with the honeybee transcription factor Mblk1. The
deduced 433-amino acid protein contains a DNA-binding motif and a motif
conserved in Mlr1 (LCORL; 611799). Northern blot analysis detected
expression of Mlr2 in mouse kidney, liver, and heart, with weak
expression in brain and no expression in testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Fernandes et al. (2003) determined that binding of LCOR to ESR1 depends
in part on residues in the coactivator-binding pocket of ESR1 distinct
from those bound by TIF2 (601993). Repression by LCOR could be abolished
by histone deacetylase (HDAC; see 601241) inhibitor trichostatin A in a
receptor-dependent fashion, indicating HDAC-dependent and -independent
modes of action. LCOR bound directly to specific HDACs in vitro and in
vivo. Moreover, LCOR was shown to function by recruiting
C-terminal-binding protein (CTBP; see 602618) corepressors through 2
consensus binding motifs and to colocalize with CTBPs in the nucleus.
Fernandes et al. (2003) concluded that LCOR represents a class of
corepressor that attenuates agonist-activated nuclear receptor signaling
by multiple mechanisms.

Using a reporter gene assay, Kunieda et al. (2003) showed that mouse
Mlr2 bound and activated transcription from the DNA element recognized
by honeybee Mblk1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fernandes et al. (2003) determined that the LCOR gene contains 7 exons,
including 4 short 5-prime untranslated region exons that contain several
in-frame stop codons.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the LCOR gene to chromosome 10 by radiation
hybrid analysis. By genomic sequence analysis, Fernandes et al. (2003)
mapped the LCOR gene to chromosome 10q24.1.

120260	TITLE *120260 COLLAGEN, TYPE IX, ALPHA-2; COL9A2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The COL9A2 gene encodes the alpha-2 subunit of collagen type IX. Type IX
collagen, a heterotrimer of alpha-1 (COL9A1; 120210), alpha-2, and
alpha-3 (COL9A3; 120270) chains specific for this type of collagen, is a
cartilage-specific fibril-associated collagen (Perala et al., 1993).

CLONING

In the process of characterizing genomic clones for the mouse COL9A2
gene, Perala et al. (1993) also used 4 pairs of oligonucleotide primers
designed for amplification of murine exon sequences to construct cDNA
clones for the human gene spanning more than 90% of the coding region.
The amino acid and nucleotide sequence identities between human and
chick are 78 and 71%, respectively.

MAPPING

Perala et al. (1993) assigned the human COL9A2 gene to chromosome 1 by
study of a panel of DNAs from human/rodent somatic cell hybrids.

Warman et al. (1994) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to
regionalize the COL9A2 gene to 1p33-p32.3. A single-strand conformation
polymorphism within the murine gene was used to map Col9a2 to mouse
chromosome 4. Since one form of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (EDM2;
600204) maps to the same region of chromosome 1, COL9A2 was considered
to be a candidate gene for that disorder.

Hellsten et al. (1995) demonstrated that the COL9A2 gene is in a 1-Mb
contig, proximal to RLF (180610) and MYCL1 (164850).

GENE FUNCTION

The cartilage collagen fibrils are formed from fibrillar collagens II
and XI (120280), while collagen IX is located on the fibril surface (see
Figure 2 in Muragaki et al., 1996). The alpha-1(IX) chain contains a
large N-terminal globular domain (NC4); a chondroitin sulfate chain is
attached to the alpha-2(IX) chain (Muragaki et al., 1996).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia 2

The usefulness of the candidate gene approach for identification of a
basic gene defect was illustrated by the finding of a mutation in the
COL9A2 gene (120260.0001) in a Dutch kindred with multiple epiphyseal
dysplasia 2 (EDM2; 600204) showing linkage to DNA markers in the region
of 1p32 (Muragaki et al., 1996). Muragaki et al. (1996) stated that the
results provided by the EDM2 'experiment of nature' represent the first
in vivo evidence for the role of collagen IX in human articular
cartilage.

Holden et al. (1999) described 2 families with distinctive
oligoepiphyseal forms of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, in which
heterozygosity for different mutations in the COL9A2 gene (120260.0002
and 120260.0003) was found. Both of these mutations resulted in the
skipping of exon 3 from the COL9A2 mRNA, but the position of the
mutation in the splice donor site determined the stability of the mRNA
produced from the mutant allele.

- Intervertebral Disc Disease

In Finnish individuals with sciatica and radiologically documented
intervertebral disc disease (IDD; 603932), Annunen et al. (1999)
identified a mutation in the COL9A2 gene (120260.0004).

- Stickler Syndrome V

In a large 5-generation consanguineous pedigree of Asian Indian origin
segregating autosomal recessive Stickler syndrome (STL5; 614284), Baker
et al. (2011) analyzed 3 candidate collagen IX-related genes and
identified homozygosity for an 8-bp deletion in the COL9A2 gene
(120260.0006) that segregated with disease in the family.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
EPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, MULTIPLE, 2
COL9A2, IVS3DS, T-C, +2

Muragaki et al. (1996) demonstrated a mutation in affected members of a
family with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (600204) that showed linkage
to the 1p32 region. Affected members were heterozygous for a splice site
mutation causing exon skipping during RNA splicing and an in-frame loss
of 12 amino acids within the alpha-2 (IX) collagen chain. The results
provided the first in vivo evidence for the role of collagen IX in human
articular cartilage. The clinical findings in the family were entirely
characteristic of MED although hip complaints were less conspicuous than
in many kindreds. The specific mutation was a T-to-C transition in the
consensus donor splice site of intron 3, resulting in the skipping of
exon 3.

Jackson et al. (2010) reported a large 4-generation family with
autosomal dominant transmission of EDM2 associated with the T-to-C
transition in intron 3 (186+2T-C) of the COL9A2 gene. The family had
previously been reported by Versteylen et al. (1988). The proband was a
33-year-old woman with short stature who complained of stiff and painful
hands and knees since age 4 years. Radiographs of the knees showed
Blount disease (progressive varus deformity of the proximal tibia
associated with internal torsion of the tibia) and of the spine showed
mild spondyloarthrotic abnormalities in the thoracic region. Her sister
had painful and swollen knees since age 4 years and developed severe
osteochondritis dissecans as an adult. Two sons of the proband were also
affected, showing pain in the knees during walking and clumsy walking.
These boys also had frontal bossing, depressed nasal bridge, and were
easily fatigued with mild muscle weakness. Radiographs of 1 son at age 3
years showed delayed ossification of the epiphyses, small proximal
femoral epiphyses, and small femoral and tibial epiphyses around the
knees. Skeletal muscle biopsy and mitochondrial studies showed no
significant abnormalities, only mild variations in fiber size and
slightly diminished ATP production. Jackson et al. (2010) commented on
the mild myopathy present in the boys, and noted that EDM is
characterized by clinical variability even within the same family. The
mild myopathic and mitochondrial changes observed may be secondary to a
tendonopathy and/or cell stress response resulting from expression of
mutant collagen.

.0002
EPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, MULTIPLE, 2
COL9A2, IVS3DS, 186G-A

In family K of Holden et al. (1999) with EDM2 (600204) the proband was a
17-year-old male of normal height who was diagnosed in childhood with
pain in the joints, mostly the knees, and genu varum. Radiographs showed
major epiphyseal changes in the knees and hands, and almost no changes
in the hips. The spine also appeared normal. The molecular change was a
G-to-A transition in the last nucleotide of exon 3, changing the last
codon of exon 3 from CCG (pro) to CCA (also pro). Although there was no
change in the amino acid, the change interfered with splicing.

Nakashima et al. (2005) identified the exon 3 G-to-A transition in the
COL9A2 gene in affected members of a Japanese family with EDM2. The
proband had bilateral double-layered patellae, indicating that this
unusual feature is not unique to autosomal recessive multiple epiphyseal
dysplasia with homozygous mutations in the DTDST gene (606718; see EDM4
226900).

Jackson et al. (2010) reported a patient with EDM2 characterized by
onset at age 3 years of an abnormal gait associated with proximal muscle
weakness. He had left-sided developmental dysplasia of the hip. The
family history was positive for hypodontia and for osteochondritis
dissecans. However, 2 affected adult family members showed improvement
of the disorder after puberty. The proband was heterozygous for the
186G-A transition in the splice donor sequence of exon 3 of the COL9A2
gene.

.0003
EPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, MULTIPLE, 2
COL9A2, IVS3DS, G-C, +5

Family G reported by Holden et al. (1999) with an oligoepiphyseal form
of MED (600204) and a mutation in the COL9A2 gene had affected members
in 4 generations, of whom a mother and her 2 sons were available for
study. They were slightly short in stature (adult height, 158 cm), and
all 3 developed genu valgum, which required surgical correction. The
mother started walking late and with a stiff gait that became more
noticeable during ages 5 to 7 years. Her legs became increasingly bowed,
and at age 17 she underwent tibial osteotomy. She had developed
increasing problems with pain in her hands, lumbar spine, and ankles.
Her 2 sons walked at age 2 years with a stiff gait. Epiphyseal dysplasia
was recognized in them in early childhood, and they underwent tibial
osteotomy for genu valgum at ages 14 and 13, respectively. They
continued to have mild joint symptoms, including intermittent lumbar
back pain and knee pain with swelling. Changes were not found clinically
or radiographically in the hips. Affected members showed heterozygosity
for a G-to-C transversion at position +5 of intron 3.

INTERVERTEBRAL DISC DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
COL9A2, GLN326TRP

In a study that examined for allelic variation in the COL9A2 gene in
Finnish individuals with sciatica and radiologically documented
intervertebral disc disease (IDD; 603932), Annunen et al. (1999) found a
substitution of tryptophan for glutamine at codon 326. This change was
found in 6 of 157 individuals with disc disease but in none of 174
controls. Further analysis of the families of 4 of the original patients
revealed that all individuals heterozygous for the trp substitution
demonstrated the disease phenotype. Many individuals within these
families had IDD but not the trp allele. The authors invoked a high
phenocopy rate to reconcile this observation with the conclusion that
this sequence variant within COL9A2 contributes to the pathogenesis of
disease. In the disease model chosen, this locus accounted for 10% of
disease prevalence. Under these constraints, Annunen et al. (1999)
demonstrated a lod score of 4.5 at a recombination fraction of 0.12.
Subsequent linkage disequilibrium analysis conditional on linkage gave
an additional lod score of 7.1. The authors did not exclude the
possibility that a true disease locus may lie in close physical
proximity to COL9A2.

.0005
EPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, MULTIPLE, 2
COL9A2, IVS3DS, G-C, -1

In 12 affected members from a 4-generation family with a relatively
hip-sparing EDM2 phenotype (600204), Fiedler et al. (2002) identified a
G-to-C mutation in the last nucleotide of exon 3 of the COL9A2 gene. The
disorder was characterized by childhood onset of pain and stiffness in
the knees. Finger joints, ankles, and elbows became symptomatic during
early adult life. Some adult patients had free articular bodies which
resulted in locking of the joints. Fiedler et al. (2002) noted that a
G-to-A change at the same nucleotide had earlier been found to cause
EDM2 (120260.0002).

.0006
STICKLER SYNDROME V
COL9A2, 8-BP DEL, NT843

In an affected sister and brother from a large 5-generation
consanguineous pedigree of Asian Indian origin segregating autosomal
recessive Stickler syndrome (STL5; 614284), Baker et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for an 8-bp deletion in the COL9A2 gene
involving the last 4 nucleotides of exon 16 and the first 4 nucleotides
of IVS16 (843_846+4del8). The deletion was predicted to cause a
frameshift and downstream premature termination codon (asp281glnfsX70).
The mutation was detected in heterozygosity in the sibs' unaffected
brother and parents.

606916	TITLE *606916 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 61; GPR61
;;BIOGENIC AMINE RECEPTOR-LIKE GPCR; BALGR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs, or GPRs) contain 7 transmembrane
domains and transduce extracellular signals through heterotrimeric G
proteins.

CLONING

By PCR of genomic DNA, Lee et al. (2001) obtained a partial GPR61 clone
using primers designed from the sequence of a rabbit G protein-coupled
receptor (GPCR). They used the PCR products to screen a human brain cDNA
library and found that GPR61 encodes a 417-amino acid protein that
shares over 80% identity with the rabbit homolog and 44% similarity with
GPR62 (606917) in the transmembrane region. By Northern blot analysis of
human brain areas, Lee et al. (2001) detected a 4.3-kb transcript in
caudate, putamen, and thalamus, but not in hypothalamus, hippocampus,
pons, frontal cortex, or cerebellum. No expression was found in liver or
kidney. Lee et al. (2001) also cloned rat GPR61 and, by in situ
hybridization, found widespread expression in rat brain.

Cikos et al. (2001) independently cloned GPR61, which they called BALGR.
A partial sequence was obtained by RT-PCR of human brain mRNA using
degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to a transmembrane sequence of
GPR30 (601805). They cloned the full-length cDNA from a hypothalamus
cDNA library. They found that the deduced protein contains 451 amino
acids and has a calculated molecular mass of about 49 kD. GPR61 contains
7 putative transmembrane domains, a potential N-glycosylation site,
cysteine residues that may form a disulfide bridge, and several putative
protein kinase sites. It also contains a conserved glu-arg-tyr sequence
shared with other GPCRs. The highest sequence similarity (28-31%) was
found with biogenic amine GPCRs, i.e., serotonin, histamine, adrenergic,
and dopamine GPCRs. By semiquantitative PCR of multiple human tissues,
Cikos et al. (2001) found highest expression in brain and testes and low
but detectable expression in all other tissues examined. Their results
of Northern blot analysis of human brain regions differed from that
reported by Lee et al. (2001). Strong expression of a 4.8-kb transcript
was found in cerebral cortex, occipital pole, frontal lobe, temporal
lobe, amygdala, and hippocampus, and lower expression in putamen and
caudate nucleus. No message was detected in cerebellum, medulla
oblongata, spinal cord, corpus callosum, substantia nigra, subthalamic
nucleus, or thalamus.

MAPPING

By PCR using a human/rodent somatic cell hybrid panel as template, Cikos
et al. (2001) mapped the GPR61 gene to chromosome 1.

131320	TITLE *131320 GATA-BINDING PROTEIN 3; GATA3
;;ENHANCER-BINDING PROTEIN GATA3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The genes for all 4 subunits of the T-cell antigen receptor (alpha,
186880; beta, 186930; gamma, 186970; and delta, 186810) are controlled
by distinct enhancers and their enhancer-binding proteins. Marine and
Winoto (1991) identified a common TCR regulatory element by
demonstrating binding of the enhancer-binding protein GATA3 to the
enhancer elements of all 4 TCR genes. GATA3 had been shown in the
chicken to be an enhancer-binding protein containing a zinc finger
domain. GATA3 mRNA was demonstrated by Northern blot analysis in T cells
but not in B cells, macrophages, or HeLa cell lines. GATA3 was
abundantly expressed in the T-lymphocyte lineage and was thought to
participate in T-cell receptor gene activation through binding to
enhancers. Labastie et al. (1994) cloned the human gene and the 5-prime
end of the mouse gene. The 2 zinc fingers of GATA3 are encoded by 2
separate exons highly conserved with those of GATA1 (305371), but no
other structural homologies between the 2 genes could be found.

GENE STRUCTURE

Labastie et al. (1994) determined that the human GATA3 gene contains 6
exons distributed over 17 kb of DNA.

MAPPING

Joulin et al. (1991) mapped the human GATA3 gene to chromosome 10p15 by
in situ hybridization, and Copeland et al. (1993) mapped the mouse Gata3
gene to chromosome 2.

GENE FUNCTION

CD4 (186940) T cells potentiate the inflammatory or humoral immune
response through the action of Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively. Zheng
and Flavell (1997) found that GATA3 was expressed at a high level in
naive, freshly activated cells and Th2 lineage cells, but subsided to a
minimal level in Th1 lineage cells as naive cells committed to their Th
subset. Antisense GATA3 inhibited the expression of all Th2 cytokine
genes in a Th2 clone. In transgenic mice, elevated GATA3 and CD4 T cells
caused Th2 cytokine gene expression in developing Th1 cells. Thus, Zheng
and Flavell (1997) concluded that GATA3 is necessary and sufficient for
Th2 cytokine gene expression.

Interleukin-5 (IL5; 147850) plays a central role in the growth and
differentiation of eosinophils and contributes to several disease
states, including asthma. There is evidence for a role for cyclic AMP as
an immunomodulator: agents that increase intracellular cAMP levels
inhibit production of cytokines predominantly produced by T-alpha-1
(Th1) cells such as IL2 (147680) and interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570). In
contrast, the production of IL5, predominantly produced by Th2 cells, is
enhanced by these agents. Siegel et al. (1995) defined precisely the
cis-activating elements that regulate inducible murine Il5
transcription: sequences within the CLE0 element and also a region
located between -70 and -59 of the IL5 promoter that binds the
transcription factor Gata3. They speculated that activation via this
unique sequence combination confers the specificity needed for selective
expression of the IL5 gene in response to elevated levels of
intracellular cAMP.

Zhang et al. (1997) demonstrated that GATA3 is critical for expression
of the IL5 gene in Th2 cells. Whereas mutations in the GATA3 site
abolished antigen- or cAMP-stimulated IL5 promoter activation in Th2
cells, ectopic expression of GATA3 in Th1 cells or in a nonlymphoid,
non-IL5-producing cell line activated the IL5 promoter. Other findings
suggested that GATA3 gene expression may play an important role in the
balance between Th1 and Th2 subsets in immune responses. Zhang et al.
(1997) suggested that inhibition of GATA3 activity has therapeutic
potential in the treatment of asthma and other hypereosinophilic
diseases.

Zhang et al. (1998) showed that ectopic expression of GATA3 is
sufficient to drive IL5 but not IL4 gene (147780) expression. Also, in
Th2 cells, antisense GATA3 RNA inhibits IL5 but not IL4 promoter
activation. The induction of IL5 gene expression by GATA3 involves high
affinity binding of GATA3 to an inverted GATA repeat in the IL5
promoter.

Nakamura et al. (1999) found increased GATA3 gene expression in
association with cells showing an increase in IL5 mRNA in asthmatic
airways. They interpreted these findings as supporting a causal
association between augmented GATA3 expression and dysregulated IL5
expression in atopic asthma.

Tong et al. (2000) showed that murine Gata2 and Gata3 are specifically
expressed in white adipocyte precursors and that their downregulation
sets the stage for terminal differentiation. Constitutive Gata2 and
Gata3 expression suppressed adipocyte differentiation and trapped cells
at the preadipocyte stage. This effect was mediated, at least in part,
through the direct suppression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-gamma (PPARG; 601487). Gata3-deficient embryonic stem cells
exhibit an enhanced capacity to differentiate into adipocytes, and
defective Gata2 and Gata3 expression is associated with obesity. Thus,
Tong et al. (2000) concluded that GATA2 and GATA3 regulate adipocyte
differentiation through molecular control of the preadipocyte-adipocyte
transition.

Fields et al. (2002) noted that high levels of histone acetylation at
particular loci correlate with transcriptional activity, whereas reduced
levels correlate with silencing. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP), PCR, and green fluorescent protein analysis, they demonstrated
that histones in the cytokine loci (IFNG and IL4) of naive T cells are
unacetylated, but upon TCR stimulation, the loci are rapidly and
progressively acetylated on histones H3 and H4. The acetylation at the
IL4 locus occurs early, regardless of Th1/Th2 polarizing conditions,
correlating with early transcription. The maintenance of acetylation
depends on cytokine and STAT4 (600558) and STAT6 (601512) signaling and
also on the transactivator activity of TBET (604895) and GATA3, the
putative 'master regulators' of Th lineage determination.

Hwang et al. (2005) reported that TBET represses Th2 lineage commitment
through tyrosine kinase-mediated interaction between itself and GATA3
that interferes with the binding of GATA3 to its target DNA. Hwang et
al. (2005) concluded that their results provide a novel function for
tyrosine phosphorylation of a transcription factor in specifying
alternate fates of a common progenitor cell. Hwang et al. (2005) showed
that TBET phosphorylation is restricted to the TEC kinases ITK (186973)
and RLK (600058). Coexpression studies demonstrated that this was most
efficiently performed by ITK. In primary CD4 T cells isolated from ITK-,
RLK-, or double ITK/RLK-deficient mice, the greatest diminution of TBET
tyrosine phosphorylation was seen in the absence of ITK. Furthermore,
mutation of TBET at tyrosine residue 525, but not control tyrosine
residue 437, resulted in greatly reduced phosphorylation by ITK,
revealing that ITK phosphorylates TBET at residue Y525 after T cell
receptor stimulation.

Chen et al. (2006) noted that activated T cells, particularly Th1 cells,
express sialyl Lewis x, but resting T cells do not. Using reporter
analysis, they showed that TBET promoted and GATA3 repressed
transcription of FUT7 (602030), the rate-limiting enzyme for sialyl
Lewis x synthesis. TBET interfered with GATA3 binding to its target DNA,
but GATA3 also interfered with TBET binding to the FUT7 promoter. GATA3
regulated FUT7 transcription by recruiting, in a
phosphorylation-dependent manner, histone deacetylase-3 (HDAC3; 605166)
and HDAC5 (605315) and by competing with CBP (CREBBP; 600140)/p300
(EP300; 602700) in binding to the N terminus of TBET. Maximal expression
of FUT7 and sialyl Lewis x in T cells was obtained by ROG (ZBTB32;
605859)-mediated suppression of GATA3. Chen et al. (2006) concluded that
the GATA3/TBET transcription factor complex regulates cell
lineage-specific expression of lymphocyte homing receptors and that
glycoconjugates are regulated by this complex to attain cell
lineage-specific expression in Th1 and Th2 lymphocyte subsets.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Terminal deletions of chromosome 10p result in a DiGeorge (188400)-like
phenotype that includes hypoparathyroidism, heart defects, immune
deficiency, deafness, and renal malformations. One region that
contributes to this complex phenotype is that for the syndrome of
hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal insufficiency
(HDRS; 146255). Van Esch et al. (2000) performed deletion-mapping
studies in 2 HDRS patients and defined a critical 200-kb region that
contains the GATA3 gene. Search for GATA3 mutations in 3 other HDR
probands identified 1 nonsense mutation (131320.0005) and 2 intragenic
deletions (131320.0003, 131320.0004) that predicted a loss of function,
as confirmed by absence of DNA binding by the mutant GATA3 protein.
These results demonstrated that GATA3 is essential in the embryonic
development of the parathyroids, auditory system, and kidneys, and
showed that GATA3 haploinsufficiency causes human HDR syndrome.

Muroya et al. (2001) studied 9 Japanese families with HDR syndrome. FISH
and microsatellite analysis showed heterozygous deletions including
GATA3 in 4 families. Sequence analysis showed heterozygous novel
mutations in 3 families, including a missense mutation in exon 4
(131320.0006), an insertion mutation (131320.0007), and a nonsense
mutation in exon 6 (131320.0008).

In 10 patients with HDR syndrome from 7 unrelated families, Nesbit et
al. (2004) identified and characterized 7 mutations in exons 3 through 6
of the GATA3 gene. Using electrophoretic mobility shift, dissociation,
yeast 2-hybrid, and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, Nesbit
et al. (2004) demonstrated that mutations involving the C-terminal zinc
finger (ZnF2) or adjacent basic amino acids result in a loss of DNA
binding, but those of the N-terminal zinc finger (ZnF1) either lead to a
loss of interaction with specific zinc finger proteins of FOG2 (ZFPM2;
603693) or alter DNA-binding affinity.

Hernandez et al. (2007) reported a mother and daughter with HDR and
female genital tract malformations in whom they identified a deletion in
the GATA3 gene (131320.0009).

Chiu et al. (2006) sequenced the CASR (601199) and GATA3 genes in 5
unrelated Chinese families with familial hypoparathyroidism. They
identified 3 novel mutations in the GATA3 gene responsible for familial
hypoparathyroidism and deafness. Except for a previously described
polymorphism, they found no genetic variants in the CASR gene.

Ali et al. (2007) analyzed the GATA3 gene in 21 HDR probands and 14
patients with isolated hypoparathyroidism (see FIH, 146200); no
mutations were found in the FIH patients, but 13 different heterozygous
germline mutations were identified in the HDR probands, including 1
missense, 1 splice site, 3 nonsense, and 8 frameshift mutations. EMSA
analysis revealed 3 classes of GATA3 mutations: those involving of loss
of DNA binding due to loss of the C-terminal zinc finger, which
represent over 90% of mutations reported in GATA3; those resulting in
reduced DNA-binding affinity; and those that do not alter DNA binding or
affinity but likely alter the conformation change that occurs during
binding in the DNA major groove, as predicted by 3-dimensional modeling.

In a 14-year-old boy with neurologic symptoms in addition to the HDR
triad of hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal
dysplasia, who did not have any microdeletion in the 22q11.2 or 10p14
regions by FISH analysis, Ferraris et al. (2009) identified a
heterozygous de novo 2-bp deletion (131320.0013) in exon2 of the GATA3
gene. The authors concluded that haploinsufficiency of GATA3 may be
responsible for a complex neurologic picture in addition to the known
triad of HDR syndrome.

In a 29-year-old Portuguese with severe hypoparathyroidism, bilateral
mild neurosensory deafness, and agenesis of the vagina and uterus but no
kidney abnormalities, Moldovan et al. (2011) analyzed the GATA3 gene and
identified a heterozygous missense mutation (C342Y; 131320.0014). The
authors noted that this patient, along with the mother and daughter with
HDR and female genital tract malformations studied by Hernandez et al.
(2007), seemed to confirm the role of GATA3 in regulating developmental
mechanisms of the uterus and vagina.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lim et al. (2000) found that null mutations of Gata3 in mice led to a
reduced accumulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; 191290) and dopamine
beta-hydroxylase (DPH; 223360) mRNA, whereas several other sympathetic
nervous system (SNS) genes were unaffected. They showed that Th and Dbh
deficiencies led to reduced noradrenalin in the SNS, and that
noradrenaline deficiency was the proximal cause of death in mutants by
feeding catechol intermediates to pregnant dams, thereby partially
averting Gata3 mutation-induced lethality. The older, pharmacologically
rescued mutants showed abnormalities that could not be detected in
untreated mutants. These late embryonic defects included renal
hypoplasia and developmental defects in structures derived from cephalic
neural crest cells. Thus, Lim et al. (2000) showed that Gata3 has a role
in the differentiation of multiple cell lineages during embryogenesis.

To elucidate GATA3 function, Pandolfi et al. (1995) disrupted the mouse
gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Mice
heterozygous for the Gata3 mutation were found to be fertile and
appeared in all respects to be normal, whereas homozygous mutant embryos
died between days 11 and 12 postcoitum and displayed massive internal
bleeding, marked growth retardation, severe deformities of the brain and
spinal cord, and gross aberrations in fetal liver hematopoiesis. The
functions of GATA1 and GATA2 (137295) had previously been studied by
comparable methods. The results in aggregate demonstrated that each
GATA-binding protein has a unique and essential function during the
development of the mouse embryo. In each case, targeted mutagenesis also
revealed surprising roles for each factor, underscoring the power of
this experimental approach: GATA1 is essential for erythroid cell
development, while disruption of GATA2 indicates a function during very
early events in the development of all blood cell lineages.

Using microarray analysis, Kaufman et al. (2003) identified Gata3 as an
induced transcription factor in embryonic day-13 to -18.5 mouse skin.
Whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis revealed Gata3 expression in
early vibrissae follicles and later in developing epidermis and in the
cone of presumptive inner root sheath (IRS) precursor cells within hair
follicles. Examination of pharmacologically rescued Gata3 -/- embryos
and grafted Gata3 -/- skin showed aberrations in hair follicle
morphogenesis that included not only structural defects in the IRS and
hair shaft, but also molecular defects in cell lineage determination.
Kaufman et al. (2003) concluded that, along with LEF1 (153245) and WNTs
(see 164820), GATA3 is at the crossroads of both lymphocyte
differentiation and of the IRS versus hair shaft cell fate decision in
hair follicle morphogenesis.

Pai et al. (2003) generated mice conditionally lacking Gata3 at early
(double-negative) and late (double-positive) stages of thymic
differentiation. They found that Gata3 was indispensable for thymocytes
to pass through beta selection, the process by which T-cell
receptor-beta is paired with pre-T-cell receptor-alpha, a requirement
for double-negative stage-3 cell survival. Furthermore, Gata3 was
required for single-positive Cd4 thymocyte development. Pai et al.
(2003) concluded that continued expression of GATA3 is required at
multiple stages of thymocyte differentiation.

Zhu et al. (2004) generated mice with a conditional deletion of Gata3
and Gata3-deficient mouse T-cell lines and found that both Il4-dependent
and -independent Th2 differentiation was diminished, permitting Th1
differentiation in the absence of Ifng and Il12 (see 161561). Deletion
of Gata3 from established Th2 cells abolished production of Il5 and Il13
(147683), but not of Il4. Mice lacking Gata3 produced Ifng rather than
Th2 cytokines in response to infection with Nippostrongylus
brasiliensis. Zhu et al. (2004) concluded that Gata3 serves as a
principal switch in determining Th1-Th2 responses.

Van der Wees et al. (2004) analyzed auditory brainstem response
thresholds in heterozygous Gata3-knockout mice from 1 to 19 months of
age and demonstrated a hearing loss of 30 dB compared to wildtype
littermates. No physiologic or morphologic abnormalities were found in
the brainstem, cerebral cortex, or the outer or middle ear. However, the
cochleae of Gata3 +/- mice showed significant progressive morphologic
degeneration starting with the outer hair cells at the apex and
ultimately involving all hair cells and supporting cells in the entire
cochlea. Van der Wees et al. (2004) concluded that hearing loss
following GATA3 haploinsufficiency is peripheral in nature and that this
defect is detectable from early postnatal development and continues
through adulthood.

Kouros-Mehr et al. (2006) found that Gata3 was the most highly enriched
transcription factor in mammary epithelium of pubertal mice. Conditional
deletion of Gata3 led to severe defects in mammary development due to
failure in terminal end bud formation during puberty. After acute Gata3
loss, adult mice exhibited undifferentiated luminal cell expansion with
basement-membrane detachment, which led to caspase (see CASP1;
147678)-mediated cell death.

In a mother and her son with HDR syndrome (146255), Van Esch et al.
(2000) identified a nonsense mutation at nucleotide 828 of the GATA3
gene, a C-to-T transition resulting in an arginine-to-ter substitution
at residue 277 (R277X). This mutation was predicted to result in a

In a Japanese family with HDR syndrome (146255), Muroya et al. (2001)
identified a 2-bp insertion at nucleotide 900 and a 3-bp insertion at
nucleotide 901 in exon 4 of the GATA3 gene (900insAA plus 901insCCT, or
C901AACCCT), resulting in premature termination at codon 357 with loss
of the second zinc finger domain.

GATA3, ARG367TER

In a 33-year-old Japanese man who had hypoparathyroidism, wore hearing
aids, and had proteinuria and hematuria (HDR syndrome; 146255), Muroya
et al. (2001) identified heterozygosity for a 1099C-T transition in exon
6 of the GATA3 gene, resulting in an arg367-to-ter (R367X) substitution.
The mutation was also detected in his 3-year-old daughter, who did not
have hypoparathyroidism or renal dysplasia, but was clinically suspected
of hearing loss due to speech delay.

In an 18-year-old Han Chinese boy and his 5-year-old sister, who both
had hypoparathyroidism and bilateral sensorineural deafness but no renal
dysplasia, Sun et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for the R367X
mutation in the GATA3 gene. The mutation was not found in either of
their unaffected parents; Sun et al. (2009) concluded that 1 of the
parents likely had germinal mosaicism of the mutant GATA3 gene.

In a mother and daughter with HDR syndrome (146255), Hernandez et al.
(2007) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (431delG) in exon 3
of the GATA3 gene, causing a frameshift at codon 144 and resulting in a
termination signal at codon 194. The mother had a nonfunctional right
kidney and a septate uterus, whereas her daughter had right renal

4/intron 4 boundary (IVS4+2T-GCTTACTTCCC) that was predicted to lead to
truncated GATA3 proteins lacking both N- and C-terminal zinc-containing
fingers.

In affected members of a Chinese family with HDR syndrome (146255), Chiu
et al. (2006) detected an A-to-T transversion at nucleotide 1059 in exon
6 of the GATA3 gene that resulted in an arg353-to-ser (R353S)
substitution. The mutation was predicted to disrupt the helical turn and
thus changed the angle between the C-terminal zinc finger and the
adjacent C-terminal tail.

146255), Ferraris et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a de novo
2-bp deletion (108delGG) in exon 2 of the GATA3 gene, resulting in a
frameshift and a premature stop codon after a new 15-amino acid
sequence. The unaffected parents did not carry the mutation, which was
also not found in 100 controls. Neurologic involvement included basal
ganglia calcifications, palpebral ptosis, postural strabismus,
horizontal nystagmus, and pseudopapilledema.

HYPOPARATHYROIDISM, SENSORINEURAL DEAFNESS, AND RENAL DYSPLASIA SYNDROME
GATA3, CYS342TYR

In a 29-year-old Portuguese woman with severe hypoparathyroidism,
bilateral mild neurosensory deafness, and agenesis of the vagina and
uterus but no kidney abnormalities (see 146255), Moldovan et al. (2011)
identified heterozygosity for a 1025G-A transition in exon 5 of the
GATA3 gene, resulting in a cys342-to-tyr (C342Y) substitution at a
highly conserved residue within the functionally important zinc finger-2
domain. The parents were unavailable for study, but there was no family
history of the disease.

138250	TITLE *138250 ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE 18 FAMILY, MEMBER A1; ALDH18A1
;;1-@PYRROLINE-5-CARBOXYLATE SYNTHETASE; PYCS;;
P5CS;;
GLUTAMATE GAMMA-SEMIALDEHYDE SYNTHETASE; GSAS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) catalyzes the ATP- and
NADPH-dependent conversion of L-glutamate to glutamic
gamma-semialdehyde, which is the metabolic precursor for proline
biosynthesis.

CLONING

By a method they referred to as 'database cloning,' Aral et al. (1996)
isolated and sequenced a cDNA encoding the human P5CS gene.

Hu et al. (1999) observed that mammalian P5CS undergoes alternative
splicing to generate 2 isoforms differing only by a 2-amino acid insert
at the N terminus of the gamma-glutamyl kinase active site. The short
isoform has high activity in the gut, where it participates in arginine
biosynthesis and is inhibited by ornithine. The long isoform, expressed
in multiple tissues, is necessary for the synthesis of proline from
glutamate and is insensitive to ornithine.

MAPPING

Jones (1975) presented evidence from cell hybrid studies that the
structural gene for the enzyme converting glutamate to its gamma
semialdehyde is located on chromosome 10. The fact that
glutamate-gamma-semialdehyde synthetase (GSAS) and glutamate
oxaloacetate transaminase (138180) are in the same biochemical pathway
and determined by genes on the same chromosome may have biologic
significance (Jones, 1975).

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Liu et al. (1996) mapped the PYCS
gene to 10q24.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Baumgartner et al. (2000) observed homozygosity for a missense mutation
in P5CS in the 2 sibs described by Rabier et al. (1992) with mental
retardation, joint hypermobility, skin hyperelasticity, cataract, and
metabolic abnormalities, including hyperammonemia, hypoprolinemia,
hypocitrullinemia, and hypoornithinemia (ARCL3A; 219150). The
arg84-to-gln mutation (R84Q; 138250.0001) alters a conserved residue in
the P5CS gamma-glutamyl kinase domain and dramatically reduces the
activity of both P5CS isoforms when expressed in mammalian cells.
Additionally, R84Q appears to destabilize the long isoform.

In affected individuals from a New Zealand family with mental
retardation, joint hypermobility, and skin laxity without metabolic
abnormalities, Bicknell et al. (2008) identified a homozygous mutation
in the ALDH18A1 gene (H784Y; 138250.0002). In vitro functional
expression studies indicated that the H784Y mutant protein retained
normal P5CS activity and did not impair proline synthesis. The findings
indicated that impaired enzymatic activity does not account for the
phenotype, as was suggested for the patients reported by Baumgartner et
al. (2000).

Skidmore et al. (2011) reported a child born of a consanguineous union
with features consistent with De Barsy syndrome (ARCL3A) with homozygous
mutation in the ALDH18A1 gene (138250.0003).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IIIA
ALDH18A1, ARG84GLN

Baumgartner et al. (2000) determined that the 2 sibs reported by Rabier
et al. (1992) with mental retardation, joint hypermobility, skin laxity,
cataracts, and metabolic abnormalities (219150) were homozygous for a
251G-A transition of the PYCS gene, resulting in an arg84-to-gln (R84Q)
substitution. The mutation impairs the function of both the long and
short isoforms of PYCS.

.0002
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IIIA
ALDH18A1, HIS784TYR

In 4 affected sibs, born of consanguineous New Zealand Maori parents,
with mental retardation, joint hypermobility, skin laxity without
metabolic abnormalities (219150), Bicknell et al. (2008) identified a
homozygous 2350C-T transition in exon 18 of the ALDH18A1 gene, resulting
in a his784-to-tyr (H784Y) substitution in a conserved residue in the
C-terminal motif. In vitro functional expression studies indicated that
the H784Y-mutant protein retained normal P5CS activity and did not
impair proline synthesis. The findings indicated that impaired enzymatic
activity does not account for the phenotype.

.0003
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IIIA
ALDH18A1, NT1923, G-A, +1

In a severely affected child with clinical features consistent with De
Barsy syndrome (219150), born to consanguineous parents of Pakistani
origin, Skidmore et al. (2011) reported homozygosity for a G-to-A
transition at the exon 14-intron 14 boundary (nucleotide 1923+1) of the
ALDH18A1 gene. The mutation resulted in 2 anomalous transcripts that
were predicted to encode proteins lacking the catalytic site for the
enzyme. The cellular phenotype was characterized by diminished
production of collagens type I (see 120150) and III (see 120180),
altered elastin ultrastructure, and diminished cell proliferation of
cultured dermal fibroblasts. The child had lax, wrinkled, and thin skin
with dilated and tortuous subcutaneous blood vessels, corneal clouding,
and hypotonia. The child also had severe global developmental delay and
feeding difficulties, and died in infancy of unknown causes.

;;KIAA0459
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Seki et al. (1997) cloned OTUD3, which they designated
KIAA0459. The 3-prime end of the cDNA has a repetitive element, and the
deduced protein contains 153 amino acids. In vitro transcription and
translation resulted in a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 20
kD by SDS-PAGE.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the OTUD3
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SGC32455).

604661	TITLE *604661 POTASSIUM CHANNEL-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2; KCNIP2
;;KCHIP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the brain and heart, rapidly inactivating (A-type) voltage-gated
potassium (Kv) currents operate at subthreshold membrane potentials to
control the excitability of neurons and cardiac myocytes. An et al.
(2000) described 3 Kv channel-interacting proteins called KCHIPs that
bind to the cytoplasmic amino termini of Kv4-alpha subunits. See KCHIP1
(604660). The KCHIP2 cDNA encodes a 252-amino acid protein that has a
distinct amino terminus but shares approximately 70% amino acid identity
with KCHIP1 and KCHIP3 throughout a carboxy-terminal 185-amino acid core
domain containing 4 EF-hand-like motifs. Expression of KCHIP2 and Kv4
together reconstituted several features of native A-type currents by
modulating the density, inactivation kinetics, and rate of recovery from
inactivation of Kv4 channels in heterologous cells. The KCHIPs
colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with brain Kv4-alpha subunits and
are thus integral components of native Kv4 channel complexes.

GENE FUNCTION

Jeyaraj et al. (2012) provided molecular evidence that links circadian
rhythms to vulnerability in ventricular arrhythmias in mice.
Specifically, they showed that cardiac ion channel expression and QT
interval duration (an index of myocardial repolarization) exhibit
endogenous circadian rhythmicity under the control of a clock-dependent
oscillator, Kruppel-like factor-15 (KLF15; 606465). Klf15
transcriptionally controls rhythmic expression of KChIP2, a critical
subunit required for generating the transient outward potassium current.
Deficiency or excess of Klf15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation,
abnormal repolarization, and enhanced susceptibility to ventricular
arrhythmias. Jeyaraj et al. (2012) concluded that their findings
identified circadian transcription of ion channels as a mechanism for
cardiac arrhythmogenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kuo et al. (2001) found that knockout mice deficient for Kchip2
exhibited normal cardiac structure and function but displayed a
prolonged elevation in the ST segment on the electrocardiogram. The
Kchip2 -/- mice were highly susceptible to the induction of cardiac
arrhythmias. Single-cell analysis revealed a substrate for
arrhythmogenesis, including a complete absence of transient outward
potassium current (I-to) and a marked increase in action potential
duration. These studies demonstrated that a defect in KCHIP2 is
sufficient to confer a marked genetic susceptibility to arrhythmias,
establishing a novel genetic pathway for ventricular tachycardia via a
loss of the transmural gradient of I-to.

131320	TITLE *131320 GATA-BINDING PROTEIN 3; GATA3
;;ENHANCER-BINDING PROTEIN GATA3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The genes for all 4 subunits of the T-cell antigen receptor (alpha,
186880; beta, 186930; gamma, 186970; and delta, 186810) are controlled
by distinct enhancers and their enhancer-binding proteins. Marine and
Winoto (1991) identified a common TCR regulatory element by
demonstrating binding of the enhancer-binding protein GATA3 to the
enhancer elements of all 4 TCR genes. GATA3 had been shown in the
chicken to be an enhancer-binding protein containing a zinc finger
domain. GATA3 mRNA was demonstrated by Northern blot analysis in T cells
but not in B cells, macrophages, or HeLa cell lines. GATA3 was
abundantly expressed in the T-lymphocyte lineage and was thought to
participate in T-cell receptor gene activation through binding to
enhancers. Labastie et al. (1994) cloned the human gene and the 5-prime
end of the mouse gene. The 2 zinc fingers of GATA3 are encoded by 2
separate exons highly conserved with those of GATA1 (305371), but no
other structural homologies between the 2 genes could be found.

GENE STRUCTURE

Labastie et al. (1994) determined that the human GATA3 gene contains 6
exons distributed over 17 kb of DNA.

MAPPING

Joulin et al. (1991) mapped the human GATA3 gene to chromosome 10p15 by
in situ hybridization, and Copeland et al. (1993) mapped the mouse Gata3
gene to chromosome 2.

GENE FUNCTION

CD4 (186940) T cells potentiate the inflammatory or humoral immune
response through the action of Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively. Zheng
and Flavell (1997) found that GATA3 was expressed at a high level in
naive, freshly activated cells and Th2 lineage cells, but subsided to a
minimal level in Th1 lineage cells as naive cells committed to their Th
subset. Antisense GATA3 inhibited the expression of all Th2 cytokine
genes in a Th2 clone. In transgenic mice, elevated GATA3 and CD4 T cells
caused Th2 cytokine gene expression in developing Th1 cells. Thus, Zheng
and Flavell (1997) concluded that GATA3 is necessary and sufficient for
Th2 cytokine gene expression.

Interleukin-5 (IL5; 147850) plays a central role in the growth and
differentiation of eosinophils and contributes to several disease
states, including asthma. There is evidence for a role for cyclic AMP as
an immunomodulator: agents that increase intracellular cAMP levels
inhibit production of cytokines predominantly produced by T-alpha-1
(Th1) cells such as IL2 (147680) and interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570). In
contrast, the production of IL5, predominantly produced by Th2 cells, is
enhanced by these agents. Siegel et al. (1995) defined precisely the
cis-activating elements that regulate inducible murine Il5
transcription: sequences within the CLE0 element and also a region
located between -70 and -59 of the IL5 promoter that binds the
transcription factor Gata3. They speculated that activation via this
unique sequence combination confers the specificity needed for selective
expression of the IL5 gene in response to elevated levels of
intracellular cAMP.

Zhang et al. (1997) demonstrated that GATA3 is critical for expression
of the IL5 gene in Th2 cells. Whereas mutations in the GATA3 site
abolished antigen- or cAMP-stimulated IL5 promoter activation in Th2
cells, ectopic expression of GATA3 in Th1 cells or in a nonlymphoid,
non-IL5-producing cell line activated the IL5 promoter. Other findings
suggested that GATA3 gene expression may play an important role in the
balance between Th1 and Th2 subsets in immune responses. Zhang et al.
(1997) suggested that inhibition of GATA3 activity has therapeutic
potential in the treatment of asthma and other hypereosinophilic
diseases.

Zhang et al. (1998) showed that ectopic expression of GATA3 is
sufficient to drive IL5 but not IL4 gene (147780) expression. Also, in
Th2 cells, antisense GATA3 RNA inhibits IL5 but not IL4 promoter
activation. The induction of IL5 gene expression by GATA3 involves high
affinity binding of GATA3 to an inverted GATA repeat in the IL5
promoter.

Nakamura et al. (1999) found increased GATA3 gene expression in
association with cells showing an increase in IL5 mRNA in asthmatic
airways. They interpreted these findings as supporting a causal
association between augmented GATA3 expression and dysregulated IL5
expression in atopic asthma.

Tong et al. (2000) showed that murine Gata2 and Gata3 are specifically
expressed in white adipocyte precursors and that their downregulation
sets the stage for terminal differentiation. Constitutive Gata2 and
Gata3 expression suppressed adipocyte differentiation and trapped cells
at the preadipocyte stage. This effect was mediated, at least in part,
through the direct suppression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-gamma (PPARG; 601487). Gata3-deficient embryonic stem cells
exhibit an enhanced capacity to differentiate into adipocytes, and
defective Gata2 and Gata3 expression is associated with obesity. Thus,
Tong et al. (2000) concluded that GATA2 and GATA3 regulate adipocyte
differentiation through molecular control of the preadipocyte-adipocyte
transition.

Fields et al. (2002) noted that high levels of histone acetylation at
particular loci correlate with transcriptional activity, whereas reduced
levels correlate with silencing. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP), PCR, and green fluorescent protein analysis, they demonstrated
that histones in the cytokine loci (IFNG and IL4) of naive T cells are
unacetylated, but upon TCR stimulation, the loci are rapidly and
progressively acetylated on histones H3 and H4. The acetylation at the
IL4 locus occurs early, regardless of Th1/Th2 polarizing conditions,
correlating with early transcription. The maintenance of acetylation
depends on cytokine and STAT4 (600558) and STAT6 (601512) signaling and
also on the transactivator activity of TBET (604895) and GATA3, the
putative 'master regulators' of Th lineage determination.

Hwang et al. (2005) reported that TBET represses Th2 lineage commitment
through tyrosine kinase-mediated interaction between itself and GATA3
that interferes with the binding of GATA3 to its target DNA. Hwang et
al. (2005) concluded that their results provide a novel function for
tyrosine phosphorylation of a transcription factor in specifying
alternate fates of a common progenitor cell. Hwang et al. (2005) showed
that TBET phosphorylation is restricted to the TEC kinases ITK (186973)
and RLK (600058). Coexpression studies demonstrated that this was most
efficiently performed by ITK. In primary CD4 T cells isolated from ITK-,
RLK-, or double ITK/RLK-deficient mice, the greatest diminution of TBET
tyrosine phosphorylation was seen in the absence of ITK. Furthermore,
mutation of TBET at tyrosine residue 525, but not control tyrosine
residue 437, resulted in greatly reduced phosphorylation by ITK,
revealing that ITK phosphorylates TBET at residue Y525 after T cell
receptor stimulation.

Chen et al. (2006) noted that activated T cells, particularly Th1 cells,
express sialyl Lewis x, but resting T cells do not. Using reporter
analysis, they showed that TBET promoted and GATA3 repressed
transcription of FUT7 (602030), the rate-limiting enzyme for sialyl
Lewis x synthesis. TBET interfered with GATA3 binding to its target DNA,
but GATA3 also interfered with TBET binding to the FUT7 promoter. GATA3
regulated FUT7 transcription by recruiting, in a
phosphorylation-dependent manner, histone deacetylase-3 (HDAC3; 605166)
and HDAC5 (605315) and by competing with CBP (CREBBP; 600140)/p300
(EP300; 602700) in binding to the N terminus of TBET. Maximal expression
of FUT7 and sialyl Lewis x in T cells was obtained by ROG (ZBTB32;
605859)-mediated suppression of GATA3. Chen et al. (2006) concluded that
the GATA3/TBET transcription factor complex regulates cell
lineage-specific expression of lymphocyte homing receptors and that
glycoconjugates are regulated by this complex to attain cell
lineage-specific expression in Th1 and Th2 lymphocyte subsets.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Terminal deletions of chromosome 10p result in a DiGeorge (188400)-like
phenotype that includes hypoparathyroidism, heart defects, immune
deficiency, deafness, and renal malformations. One region that
contributes to this complex phenotype is that for the syndrome of
hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal insufficiency
(HDRS; 146255). Van Esch et al. (2000) performed deletion-mapping
studies in 2 HDRS patients and defined a critical 200-kb region that
contains the GATA3 gene. Search for GATA3 mutations in 3 other HDR
probands identified 1 nonsense mutation (131320.0005) and 2 intragenic
deletions (131320.0003, 131320.0004) that predicted a loss of function,
as confirmed by absence of DNA binding by the mutant GATA3 protein.
These results demonstrated that GATA3 is essential in the embryonic
development of the parathyroids, auditory system, and kidneys, and
showed that GATA3 haploinsufficiency causes human HDR syndrome.

Muroya et al. (2001) studied 9 Japanese families with HDR syndrome. FISH
and microsatellite analysis showed heterozygous deletions including
GATA3 in 4 families. Sequence analysis showed heterozygous novel
mutations in 3 families, including a missense mutation in exon 4
(131320.0006), an insertion mutation (131320.0007), and a nonsense
mutation in exon 6 (131320.0008).

In 10 patients with HDR syndrome from 7 unrelated families, Nesbit et
al. (2004) identified and characterized 7 mutations in exons 3 through 6
of the GATA3 gene. Using electrophoretic mobility shift, dissociation,
yeast 2-hybrid, and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, Nesbit
et al. (2004) demonstrated that mutations involving the C-terminal zinc
finger (ZnF2) or adjacent basic amino acids result in a loss of DNA
binding, but those of the N-terminal zinc finger (ZnF1) either lead to a
loss of interaction with specific zinc finger proteins of FOG2 (ZFPM2;
603693) or alter DNA-binding affinity.

Hernandez et al. (2007) reported a mother and daughter with HDR and
female genital tract malformations in whom they identified a deletion in
the GATA3 gene (131320.0009).

Chiu et al. (2006) sequenced the CASR (601199) and GATA3 genes in 5
unrelated Chinese families with familial hypoparathyroidism. They
identified 3 novel mutations in the GATA3 gene responsible for familial
hypoparathyroidism and deafness. Except for a previously described
polymorphism, they found no genetic variants in the CASR gene.

Ali et al. (2007) analyzed the GATA3 gene in 21 HDR probands and 14
patients with isolated hypoparathyroidism (see FIH, 146200); no
mutations were found in the FIH patients, but 13 different heterozygous
germline mutations were identified in the HDR probands, including 1
missense, 1 splice site, 3 nonsense, and 8 frameshift mutations. EMSA
analysis revealed 3 classes of GATA3 mutations: those involving of loss
of DNA binding due to loss of the C-terminal zinc finger, which
represent over 90% of mutations reported in GATA3; those resulting in
reduced DNA-binding affinity; and those that do not alter DNA binding or
affinity but likely alter the conformation change that occurs during
binding in the DNA major groove, as predicted by 3-dimensional modeling.

In a 14-year-old boy with neurologic symptoms in addition to the HDR
triad of hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal
dysplasia, who did not have any microdeletion in the 22q11.2 or 10p14
regions by FISH analysis, Ferraris et al. (2009) identified a
heterozygous de novo 2-bp deletion (131320.0013) in exon2 of the GATA3
gene. The authors concluded that haploinsufficiency of GATA3 may be
responsible for a complex neurologic picture in addition to the known
triad of HDR syndrome.

In a 29-year-old Portuguese with severe hypoparathyroidism, bilateral
mild neurosensory deafness, and agenesis of the vagina and uterus but no
kidney abnormalities, Moldovan et al. (2011) analyzed the GATA3 gene and
identified a heterozygous missense mutation (C342Y; 131320.0014). The
authors noted that this patient, along with the mother and daughter with
HDR and female genital tract malformations studied by Hernandez et al.
(2007), seemed to confirm the role of GATA3 in regulating developmental
mechanisms of the uterus and vagina.

Lim et al. (2000) found that null mutations of Gata3 in mice led to a
reduced accumulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; 191290) and dopamine
beta-hydroxylase (DPH; 223360) mRNA, whereas several other sympathetic
nervous system (SNS) genes were unaffected. They showed that Th and Dbh
deficiencies led to reduced noradrenalin in the SNS, and that
noradrenaline deficiency was the proximal cause of death in mutants by
feeding catechol intermediates to pregnant dams, thereby partially
averting Gata3 mutation-induced lethality. The older, pharmacologically
rescued mutants showed abnormalities that could not be detected in
untreated mutants. These late embryonic defects included renal
hypoplasia and developmental defects in structures derived from cephalic
neural crest cells. Thus, Lim et al. (2000) showed that Gata3 has a role
in the differentiation of multiple cell lineages during embryogenesis.

To elucidate GATA3 function, Pandolfi et al. (1995) disrupted the mouse
gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Mice
heterozygous for the Gata3 mutation were found to be fertile and
appeared in all respects to be normal, whereas homozygous mutant embryos
died between days 11 and 12 postcoitum and displayed massive internal
bleeding, marked growth retardation, severe deformities of the brain and
spinal cord, and gross aberrations in fetal liver hematopoiesis. The
functions of GATA1 and GATA2 (137295) had previously been studied by
comparable methods. The results in aggregate demonstrated that each
GATA-binding protein has a unique and essential function during the
development of the mouse embryo. In each case, targeted mutagenesis also
revealed surprising roles for each factor, underscoring the power of
this experimental approach: GATA1 is essential for erythroid cell
development, while disruption of GATA2 indicates a function during very
early events in the development of all blood cell lineages.

Using microarray analysis, Kaufman et al. (2003) identified Gata3 as an
induced transcription factor in embryonic day-13 to -18.5 mouse skin.
Whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis revealed Gata3 expression in
early vibrissae follicles and later in developing epidermis and in the
cone of presumptive inner root sheath (IRS) precursor cells within hair
follicles. Examination of pharmacologically rescued Gata3 -/- embryos
and grafted Gata3 -/- skin showed aberrations in hair follicle
morphogenesis that included not only structural defects in the IRS and
hair shaft, but also molecular defects in cell lineage determination.
Kaufman et al. (2003) concluded that, along with LEF1 (153245) and WNTs
(see 164820), GATA3 is at the crossroads of both lymphocyte
differentiation and of the IRS versus hair shaft cell fate decision in
hair follicle morphogenesis.

Pai et al. (2003) generated mice conditionally lacking Gata3 at early
(double-negative) and late (double-positive) stages of thymic
differentiation. They found that Gata3 was indispensable for thymocytes
to pass through beta selection, the process by which T-cell
receptor-beta is paired with pre-T-cell receptor-alpha, a requirement
for double-negative stage-3 cell survival. Furthermore, Gata3 was
required for single-positive Cd4 thymocyte development. Pai et al.
(2003) concluded that continued expression of GATA3 is required at
multiple stages of thymocyte differentiation.

Zhu et al. (2004) generated mice with a conditional deletion of Gata3
and Gata3-deficient mouse T-cell lines and found that both Il4-dependent
and -independent Th2 differentiation was diminished, permitting Th1
differentiation in the absence of Ifng and Il12 (see 161561). Deletion
of Gata3 from established Th2 cells abolished production of Il5 and Il13
(147683), but not of Il4. Mice lacking Gata3 produced Ifng rather than
Th2 cytokines in response to infection with Nippostrongylus
brasiliensis. Zhu et al. (2004) concluded that Gata3 serves as a
principal switch in determining Th1-Th2 responses.

Van der Wees et al. (2004) analyzed auditory brainstem response
thresholds in heterozygous Gata3-knockout mice from 1 to 19 months of
age and demonstrated a hearing loss of 30 dB compared to wildtype
littermates. No physiologic or morphologic abnormalities were found in
the brainstem, cerebral cortex, or the outer or middle ear. However, the
cochleae of Gata3 +/- mice showed significant progressive morphologic
degeneration starting with the outer hair cells at the apex and
ultimately involving all hair cells and supporting cells in the entire
cochlea. Van der Wees et al. (2004) concluded that hearing loss
following GATA3 haploinsufficiency is peripheral in nature and that this
defect is detectable from early postnatal development and continues
through adulthood.

Kouros-Mehr et al. (2006) found that Gata3 was the most highly enriched
transcription factor in mammary epithelium of pubertal mice. Conditional
deletion of Gata3 led to severe defects in mammary development due to
failure in terminal end bud formation during puberty. After acute Gata3
loss, adult mice exhibited undifferentiated luminal cell expansion with
basement-membrane detachment, which led to caspase (see CASP1;
147678)-mediated cell death.

In a mother and her son with HDR syndrome (146255), Van Esch et al.
(2000) identified a nonsense mutation at nucleotide 828 of the GATA3
gene, a C-to-T transition resulting in an arginine-to-ter substitution
at residue 277 (R277X). This mutation was predicted to result in a

In a Japanese family with HDR syndrome (146255), Muroya et al. (2001)
identified a 2-bp insertion at nucleotide 900 and a 3-bp insertion at
nucleotide 901 in exon 4 of the GATA3 gene (900insAA plus 901insCCT, or
C901AACCCT), resulting in premature termination at codon 357 with loss
of the second zinc finger domain.

GATA3, ARG367TER

In a 33-year-old Japanese man who had hypoparathyroidism, wore hearing
aids, and had proteinuria and hematuria (HDR syndrome; 146255), Muroya
et al. (2001) identified heterozygosity for a 1099C-T transition in exon
6 of the GATA3 gene, resulting in an arg367-to-ter (R367X) substitution.
The mutation was also detected in his 3-year-old daughter, who did not
have hypoparathyroidism or renal dysplasia, but was clinically suspected
of hearing loss due to speech delay.

In an 18-year-old Han Chinese boy and his 5-year-old sister, who both
had hypoparathyroidism and bilateral sensorineural deafness but no renal
dysplasia, Sun et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for the R367X
mutation in the GATA3 gene. The mutation was not found in either of
their unaffected parents; Sun et al. (2009) concluded that 1 of the
parents likely had germinal mosaicism of the mutant GATA3 gene.

GATA3, 1-BP DEL, 431G

In a mother and daughter with HDR syndrome (146255), Hernandez et al.
(2007) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (431delG) in exon 3
of the GATA3 gene, causing a frameshift at codon 144 and resulting in a
termination signal at codon 194. The mother had a nonfunctional right
kidney and a septate uterus, whereas her daughter had right renal

3 of the GATA3 gene (478delG), predicted to result in frameshift from
codon 160 and premature termination at codon 194. The mutation was
hypothesized to disrupt dual zinc fingers as well as 1 transactivating
domain.

et al. (2006) detected a donor splice site mutation at the GATA3 exon
4/intron 4 boundary (IVS4+2T-GCTTACTTCCC) that was predicted to lead to
truncated GATA3 proteins lacking both N- and C-terminal zinc-containing
fingers.

GATA3, ARG353SER

In affected members of a Chinese family with HDR syndrome (146255), Chiu
et al. (2006) detected an A-to-T transversion at nucleotide 1059 in exon
6 of the GATA3 gene that resulted in an arg353-to-ser (R353S)
substitution. The mutation was predicted to disrupt the helical turn and
thus changed the angle between the C-terminal zinc finger and the
adjacent C-terminal tail.

HYPOPARATHYROIDISM, SENSORINEURAL DEAFNESS, AND RENAL DYSPLASIA SYNDROME
GATA3, 2-BP DEL, 108GG

In a 14-year-old boy with neurologic symptoms in addition to
hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal dysplasia (HDRS;
146255), Ferraris et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a de novo
2-bp deletion (108delGG) in exon 2 of the GATA3 gene, resulting in a
frameshift and a premature stop codon after a new 15-amino acid
sequence. The unaffected parents did not carry the mutation, which was
also not found in 100 controls. Neurologic involvement included basal
ganglia calcifications, palpebral ptosis, postural strabismus,
horizontal nystagmus, and pseudopapilledema.

HYPOPARATHYROIDISM, SENSORINEURAL DEAFNESS, AND RENAL DYSPLASIA SYNDROME
GATA3, CYS342TYR

In a 29-year-old Portuguese woman with severe hypoparathyroidism,
bilateral mild neurosensory deafness, and agenesis of the vagina and
uterus but no kidney abnormalities (see 146255), Moldovan et al. (2011)
identified heterozygosity for a 1025G-A transition in exon 5 of the
GATA3 gene, resulting in a cys342-to-tyr (C342Y) substitution at a
highly conserved residue within the functionally important zinc finger-2
domain. The parents were unavailable for study, but there was no family
history of the disease.

601045	TITLE *601045 CATENIN, DELTA-1; CTNND1
;;CATENIN, DELTA; CTNND;;
CADHERIN-ASSOCIATED SRC SUBSTRATE; CAS;;
p120(CTN)
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Catenins were discovered as proteins that are linked ('catena' means
'chain' in Latin) to the cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane cadherin
(see 601120) proteins. Delta-catenin, also called CAS, p120(cas), or
p120(ctn), is a tyrosine kinase substrate implicated in ligand-induced
receptor signaling through the EGF receptor (131550), the PDGF receptor
(PDGFR; see 173490), and the CSF1 receptor (164770), as well as in cell
transformation by SRC (190090). Delta-catenin is a major component of
multiprotein cell-cell adhesion complexes containing E-cadherin
(192090), alpha-catenin (116805), beta-catenin (116806), and
gamma-catenin, also known as plakoglobin (173325) (summary by
Keirsebilck et al., 1998).

CLONING

Reynolds et al. (1992) isolated a mouse p120(ctn) cDNA. Like
beta-catenin and plakoglobin, the predicted protein contains copies of a
repeat originally identified in the Drosophila 'Armadillo' protein.

Keirsebilck et al. (1998) identified human p120(ctn) isoforms, which
they designated 1 to 4, that arise by alternative use of start codons
and additional isoforms that differ due to alternative splicing of 3
exons, which they named A, B, and C. The longest isoform was of type
1ABC and contained 968 amino acids. Isoform 1A contains 933 amino acids
and is 97% identical to mouse p120(ctn). Human p120(ctn) contains up to
10 Armadillo repeats. Keirsebilck et al. (1998) used RT-PCR to
demonstrate tissue-specific and cell line-specific expression of various
isoforms.

Independently, Nagase et al. (1997) identified KIAA0384, a human
p120(ctn) cDNA that encodes isoform 1AC, in a screen for brain cDNAs
encoding proteins larger than 100 kD. RT-PCR detected expression in all
tissues examined except skeletal muscle. Highest expression was detected
in placenta, lung, liver, and kidney, followed by ovary and small
intestine.

GENE FUNCTION

Dillon et al. (1998) reported that a complete loss of p120(ctn)
expression was observed in approximately 10% of invasive ductal breast
carcinomas investigated.

Wildenberg et al. (2006) found that depletion of p120-catenin in NIH3T3
mouse fibroblasts by small interfering RNA caused constitutive
activation of Rho (RHOA; 165390), cell transformation, loss of contact
inhibition, and growth in the absence of serum. Moreover, Pdgfr and
integrin (see 135630) signaling pathways involved in remodeling the
actin cytoskeleton were selectively impaired. Wildenberg et al. (2006)
traced these effects to obligatory roles of p120-catenin and Arhgap5
(602680) in a pathway that connects Rac (RAC1; 602048) activation to Rho
inhibition. They concluded that p120-catenin and ARHGAP5 use Rho GTPases
to mediate crosstalk between a wide variety of receptors to coordinate
cadherin function with other activities that direct cell adhesion,
motility, and proliferation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Keirsebilck et al. (1998) determined that the human p120(ctn) gene
contains 21 exons, potentially encoding up to 32 protein isoforms as
products of alternative splicing.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Reynolds et al. (1996) determined
that the human gene, symbolized CTNND, is localized immediately adjacent
to the centromere in band 11q11. By interspecific backcross analysis,
they assigned the murine gene, symbolized Catns, to the middle of mouse
chromosome 2. By analysis of radiation hybrids, Nagase et al. (1997)
confirmed that the p120 gene maps to human chromosome 11. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization and analysis of a somatic cell hybrid
mapping panel, Bonne et al. (1998) mapped the CTNND1 gene to chromosome
11q11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using conditional targeting of p120(ctn) in mouse epidermis,
Perez-Moreno et al. (2006) found that p120-null neonatal epidermis
exhibited reduced intercellular adherens junction components, but no
overt disruption in barrier function or intercellular adhesion. As the
mice aged, they displayed epidermal hypoplasia and chronic inflammation,
typified by hair degeneration and loss of body fat. Use of skin
engraftments and antiinflammatory drugs showed that these features were
not due to reductions in junctional cadherins and catenins, but rather
to NF-kappa-B (see 164011) activation. Both in vivo and in vitro,
p120-null epidermal cells activated NF-kappa-B, triggering a cascade of
proinflammatory NF-kappa-B targets. NF-kappa-B activation in p120-null
keratinocytes was accompanied by alterations in Rho GTPase activity that
appeared to reside upstream from NF-kappa-B activation and downstream
from p120 loss.

;;SNM1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; SNM1;;
SNM1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, A; SNM1A;;
KIAA0086
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNA interstrand cross-links prevent strand separation, thereby
physically blocking transcription, replication, and segregation of DNA.
DCLRE1A is one of several evolutionarily conserved genes involved in
repair of interstrand cross-links (Dronkert et al., 2000).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human immature
myeloid cell line cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1995) cloned DCLRE1A,
which they called KIAA0086. The deduced 1,040-amino acid protein shares
33.3% identity over 192 amino acids with the S. cerevisiae DNA repair
protein Snm1. Northern blot analysis detected expression in all tissues
and cell lines examined except peripheral blood leukocytes.

Dronkert et al. (2000) determined that human DCLRE1A, which they called
SNM1, contains a nuclear localization signal and a zinc finger motif in
its N-terminal half and 8 motifs shared with SNM1-like proteins of
various species in its C-terminal half. Fluorescence-tagged SNM1
localized to nuclei of transfected human fibroblasts and Chinese hamster
ovary cells, but it was excluded from nucleoli.

Using Northern blot analysis, Richie et al. (2002) detected a 4.5-kb
SNM1 transcript in all tissues examined, with highest expression in
pancreas and brain. Fluorescence-tagged SNM1 localized to the nucleus of
individual transfected HeLa and human breast carcinoma cells in 3
distinct patterns: diffuse nuclear staining, multiple nuclear foci, or 1
or 2 larger nuclear bodies.

GENE FUNCTION

Dronkert et al. (2000) found that cells overexpressing human SNM1
underwent morphologic changes consistent with apoptosis a few days after
SNM1 introduction.

Richie et al. (2002) found that exposure of cells to ionizing radiation
or to an interstrand cross-linking agent altered the pattern of SNM1
nuclear localization. Under these conditions, the number of cells
exhibiting SNM1 bodies decreased and the population of cells with SNM1
foci increased. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that SNM1
colocalized with 53BP1 (TP53BP1; 605230) before and after exposure to
ionizing radiation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed the
interaction. SNM1 foci formed after ionizing radiation were largely
coincident with foci formed by MRE11 (MRE11A; 600814) and to a lesser
extent with those formed by BRCA1 (113705), but not with those formed by
RAD51 (179617). Focus formation by SNM1 did not require ATM (607585).

GENE STRUCTURE

Demuth and Digweed (1998) determined that the DCLRE1A gene contains 9
exons and spans about 20 kb. The upstream region contains a GC box, but
no TATA box, and has 1 SP1 (189906) site, 3 AP1 (see JUN; 165160) sites,
4 AP4 (TFAP4; 600743) sites, and 1 NFKB (see 164011) site.

MAPPING

By examining a panel of human-rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al.
(1995) mapped the DCLRE1A gene to chromosome 10.

ANIMAL MODEL

Dronkert et al. (2000) found that Snm1 -/- mice were viable and fertile
and showed no major abnormalities, but they were hypersensitive to
mitomycin C compared with wildtype mice. Snm1 -/- mouse embryonic stem
cells grew at a rate comparable to wildtype stem cells, but they were
2-fold more sensitive to mitomycin C. Mutant and wildtype stem cells
showed the same sensitivity to other DNA interstrand cross-linking
agents, ultraviolet irradiation, and gamma irradiation.

600423	TITLE *600423 ENDOTHELIN-CONVERTING ENZYME 1; ECE1
;;ECE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Endothelin-converting enzyme-1 is involved in the proteolytic processing
of endothelin-1 (EDN1; 131240), -2 (EDN2; 131241), and -3 (EDN3; 131242)
to biologically active peptides.

CLONING

Schmidt et al. (1994) purified a membrane-bound protease activity from
bovine endothelial cells that specifically converts the inactive form to
EDN1. The enzyme was cleaved with trypsin and peptide sequencing
analysis confirmed it to be a zinc-chelating metalloprotease containing
the typical HEXXH (HELTH) motif. RT-PCR and cDNA screens were used to
isolate the complete cDNAs of the bovine and human enzymes.

A splice variant of the same cDNA was identified by Shimada et al.
(1995) from an umbilical vein endothelial cell library. The authors
expressed the protein in COS-1 cells and could detect it in membrane
fractions from expressing cells. Yorimitsu et al. (1995) also obtained a
human ECE cDNA by screening an ACHN human renal adenocarcinoma library.
That cDNA, referred to as AECE, encoded a predicted 770-codon open
reading frame which is was different at the amino end from the Shimada
et al. (1995) sequence but close to the Schmidt et al. (1994) sequence.
The rat ECE and human AECE amino acid sequences were over 96% alike.

GENE STRUCTURE

The ECE1 gene consists of 20 exons and spans over 120 kb (Valdenaire et
al., 1999; Funke-Kaiser et al., 2000).

Valdenaire et al. (1995) found that the precursors of the ECE1 a and b
isoform mRNAs are transcribed from 2 distinct start sites, upstream from
exon 1 and exon 3, respectively. Sequence analysis of the 2 putative
promoters revealed the presence of motifs characteristic for several
transcription factors. The authors stated that comparison of the ECE
gene structure with those of other zinc metalloproteinases, as well as a
phylogenetic study, confirmed the existence of a metalloprotease
subfamily composed of ECE1, ECE2 (610145), neutral endopeptidase
(120520), Kell blood group protein (613883), and 2 bacterial enzymes.

GENE FUNCTION

Maggi et al. (2000) demonstrated that in FNC-B4 cells, which are derived
from a human fetal olfactory epithelium, both sex steroids and odorants
regulate GnRH secretion. They found biologic activity of EDN1 in this
GnRH-secreting neuronal cell. In situ hybridization and
immunohistochemistry revealed gene and protein expression of EDN1 and
ECE1 in both fetal olfactory mucosa and FNC-B4 cells. Experiments with
radiolabeled EDN1 and EDN3 strongly indicated the presence of 2 classes
of binding sites, corresponding to the ETA (16,500 sites/cell) and the
ETB receptors (8,700 sites/cell). Functional studies using selective
analogs indicated that these 2 classes of receptors subserve distinct
functions in human GnRH-secreting cells. The ETA receptor subtype
mediated an increase in intracellular calcium and GnRH secretion.

MAPPING

Valdenaire et al. (1995) mapped the ECE1 gene to chromosome 1p36 by
isotopic in situ hybridization.

By Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA from human/mouse somatic
cell hybrids, Matsuoka et al. (1996) demonstrated that ECE1 maps to
chromosome 1. By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), they refined
the localization to 1p36.1. By FISH, Albertin et al. (1996) mapped ECE1
to 1p36 and confirmed the localization to chromosome 1 by analysis of
monochromosomal hybrids. Radiation hybrid mapping localized the gene
tentatively at the border between 1p36.3 and 1p36.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Hirschsprung Disease, Cardiac Defects, and Autonomic Dysfunction

Hofstra et al. (1999) described involvement of the ECE1 gene in a
patient with skip-lesions Hirschsprung disease, cardiac defects, and
autonomic dysfunction (613870). By screening all 19 exons of the gene,
using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis followed by sequencing,
they identified a heterozygous C-to-T transition, resulting in the
substitution of cysteine for arginine at position 742 (R742C;
600423.0001).

- Essential Hypertension

Funke-Kaiser et al. (2003) proposed that ECE1 is a candidate gene for
human blood pressure regulation and identified 5 polymorphisms in ECE1
among a cohort of 704 European hypertensive patients. Transient
transfection of the reporter constructs containing the -338A allele
(600423.0002) showed an increase in promoter activity compared with the
wildtype promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed the
specific binding of E2F2 (600426), a transcription factor, to both ECE1b
promoter sequences, with the -338A allele being associated with an
increased affinity to E2F2 compared with -338C. In 100 untreated
hypertensive women, both the -338A and -839G (600423.0003) alleles were
significantly associated with ambulatory blood pressure values. The
authors proposed a link between the cell cycle-associated E2F family and
blood pressure regulation via a component of the endothelin system.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yanagisawa et al. (1998) and Clouthier et al. (1998) showed that mice
deficient in either endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA; 131243) or ECE1
develop defects in a subset of cephalic and cardiac neural crest
derivatives. Ednra-null mice show defects in craniofacial structures,
great vessels, and cardiac outflow tract. Ece1-null mice exhibit a
virtually identical phenotype to Ednra-deficient and
endothelin-1-deficient embryos due to the absence of biologically active
endothelin-1. Ece1-deficient mice lack enteric neurons and
epidermal/choroidal melanocytes, reproducing the phenotype of Edn3
(131242) and Ednra knockout mice. Yanagisawa et al. (1998) elaborated on
the role of the Edn1/Ednra pathway in the patterning of the aortic arch
in mice.

Eckman et al. (2003) found that Ece1 +/- mice had significantly elevated
concentrations of both beta-amyloid-40 and beta-amyloid-42 (see APP;
104760) in their brains compared with littermate controls.

Choi et al. (2006) found that doubly transgenic mice expressing an
Alzheimer disease (104300)-associated APP mutation and overexpressing
PRKCE (176975) had decreased amyloid plaques, plaque-associated neuritic
dystrophy, and reactive astrocytosis compared to mice only expressing
the APP mutation. There was no evidence for altered APP cleavage in the
doubly transgenic mice; instead, overexpression of PRKCE increased the
activity of Ece1, which degrades beta-amyloid.

Ortmann et al. (2005) found that expression of Ece1 and Ece2 was
increased in nonobese diabetic mice compared with controls.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, CARDIAC DEFECTS, AND AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION
ECE1, ARG742CYS

Hofstra et al. (1999) identified an arg742-to-cys mutation in the ECE1
gene in a patient with skip-lesions Hirschsprung disease, cardiac
defects, craniofacial abnormalities and other dysmorphic features, and
autonomic dysfunction (613870). The patient's parents were not available
for testing. Amino acid position 742 is in the vicinity of the active
site of ECE1 (Valdenaire et al., 1995). Hofstra et al. (1999) suggested
that the R742C mutation was responsible for, or at least contributed to,
the phenotype of the patient in view of the function of ECE1 during
murine development suggested by mouse models, the overlap in phenotypic
features of these mouse models and those of the patient, and the
functional consequences of the mutation on enzyme activity. The mutation
was thought to lead to the phenotype by resulting in reduced levels of
EDN1 and EDN3.

.0002
HYPERTENSION, ESSENTIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
ECE1, -338C-A

Funke-Kaiser et al. (2003) identified a polymorphism in the 5-prime
flanking region of the ECE1 gene, -338C-A, that was associated with
ambulatory blood pressure values (see 145500). The polymorphism is
located within a putative consensus site for E2F (see 189971) and GATA
(see 601656) proteins. The -338A allele was associated with higher
daytime and nighttime 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure in
nontreated hypertensive women. Transient transfection of the reporter
constructs containing the -338A allele showed an increase in promoter
activity compared with the wildtype promoter. Electrophoretic mobility
shift assays revealed the specific binding of E2F2 (600426), a
transcription factor, to both ECE1b promoter sequences, with the -338A
allele being associated with an increased affinity to E2F2 compared with
-338C.

.0003
HYPERTENSION, ESSENTIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
ECE1, -839T-G

Funke-Kaiser et al. (2003) identified a polymorphism in the 5-prime
flanking region of the ECE1 gene, -839T-G, that was associated with
ambulatory blood pressure values (see 145500).

;;CHAPERONIN CONTAINING TCP1, SUBUNIT 3;;
CCT-GAMMA; CCTG;;
TCP1 RING COMPLEX, POLYPEPTIDE 5; TRIC5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Molecular chaperones are proteins capable of folding or assembling
nascent proteins in a higher order structure. A molecular chaperone
called TCP1 ring complex (TRiC) plays a role in actin and tubulin
folding. TRiC is composed of 2 heteromeric subunits of 6 to 9 different
proteins. The cytoplasmic T-complex protein-1 (TCP1; 186980), an
abundant testicular germ cell protein, has been found in this complex.
Other components of TRiC, such as TRIC5, are TCP1-related proteins
(Sevigny et al., 1994).

CLONING

Joly et al. (1994) cloned a mouse cDNA corresponding to tryptic
fragments of the bovine TRiCP5 subunit described by Frydman et al.
(1992). The mouse TRiCP5 shares 48% nucleotide and 34% amino acid
homology with mouse Tcp1. It is a cytosolic protein also found in the
nuclear matrix of several cultured human cell lines. Furthermore, like
TCP1, it is highly expressed in testis.

Sevigny et al. (1994) cloned a partial human cDNA clone homologous to
mouse TRiCP5.

Walkley et al. (1996) cloned the human cDNA from a kidney library. The
1.9-kb cDNA encodes a predicted 544-amino acid protein that is 98%
similar to the mouse sequence and 75% similar to the yeast gene. The
mRNA is expressed in a variety of human tissues and at high levels in
mouse testis.

Sevigny et al. (1996) cloned the gene coding for the mouse P5 subunit.

GENE FUNCTION

Feldman et al. (1999) demonstrated that the folding and assembly of the
VHL protein (608537) into a complex with its partner proteins, elongin B
(600787) and elongin C (600788), is directly mediated by the chaperonin
TRiC. Their results defined a novel role for TRiC in mediating
oligomerization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sevigny et al. (1996) determined that the mouse Tric5 gene contains 14
exons distributed within 25 kb of genomic DNA. Sevigny et al. (1996)
used primer extension to demonstrate multiple transcription start points
for the Tric5 gene. This was considered consistent with the lack of any
obvious TATA box upstream of the transcription start points.

MAPPING

Sevigny et al. (1994) mapped the TRIC5 gene to chromosome 1q23 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. The fact that the human TRIC5 gene
is not on chromosome 6 like other TCP1-related proteins implied to
Sevigny et al. (1994) that the genes coding the TCP1-related proteins
present in the TCP1 ring complex are probably not organized in a cluster
and thus are not synchronously regulated by a cis-acting control region
such as the LCR involved in the regulation of globin synthesis.

Sevigny et al. (1996) showed that the mouse genome contains 1 Tric5 gene
and 1 Tric5 pseudogene located on chromosomes 3F and 5B, respectively.

615364	TITLE *615364 ADENYLATE KINASE 7; AK7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Adenylate kinases (AKs; EC 2.7.4.3), such as AK7, are
phosphotransferases that catalyze the interconversion of nucleoside
phosphates. AKs maintain high levels of ATP in a combined action with
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, are required for DNA and RNA
synthesis, and may contribute to the activity of medicinal nucleoside
and nucleotide analogs (summary by Panayiotou et al., 2011).

CLONING

Panayiotou et al. (2011) cloned and characterized human AK7. The deduced
723-amino acid protein has an N-terminal domain of 368 amino acids that
is not found in other AKs, followed by a classic AK domain and a
C-terminal DPY30 (612032) motif. Fluorescence-tagged AK7 localized to
the cytosol of transfected HeLa cells.

Fernandez-Gonzalez et al. (2009) identified 3 splice variants of mouse
Ak7. The full-length, 723-amino acid Ak7 protein, which they called
Ak7a, has a WcaG motif near the N terminus, followed by an AK domain and
a C-terminal DPY30 motif. The WcaG motif is a signature of some
prokaryotic nucleoside diphosphate sugar epimerases, and the DPY30 motif
is a protein oligomerization motif. Compared with Ak7a, the Ak7b isoform
contains a C-terminal truncation and lacks the DPY30 motif, and Ak7c is
further truncated and lacks both the AK domain and DPY30 motif. RT-PCR
analysis of mouse tissues detected highest Ak7 expression in testis,
followed by trachea and oviduct. Lower expression was detected in brain
and lung, and no expression was detected in heart, kidney, liver, and
spleen. In situ hybridization revealed that Ak7 expression in brain was
restricted to ependymal cells lining the third ventricle and to choroid
plexus. In lung, Ak7 was expressed in the descending airways. In testis,
abundant Ak7 expression was found in seminiferous tubules, where it
colocalized with differentiating cells and mature spermatids. AK7 was
also expressed in respiratory epithelium of trachea. Fernandez-Gonzalez
et al. (2009) noted that Ak7 was expressed in tissues rich in epithelial
ciliated cells with (9+2) axonemes. Database analysis revealed
conservation of Ak7 only among organisms possessing motile (9+2) cilia.

GENE FUNCTION

In human nasal epithelial cell culture, Milara et al. (2010) found that
AK7 expression was upregulated during ciliogenesis and was widely
expressed in differentiated nasal epithelial cells with predominant
expression on the apical surface, suggesting that it localizes to
ciliated cells. Knockdown of AK7 using siRNA caused a decrease in
ciliary beat frequency. Nasal biopsy from patients with primary ciliary
dyskinesia showed lower AK7 mRNA and protein expression compared to
healthy control samples. The findings suggested that AK7 is involved in
ciliary beat, and Milara et al. (2010) hypothesized that downregulation
of energy transport due to decreased expression of AK7 may contribute to
the development of ciliary dyskinesia.

Panayiotou et al. (2011) found that in vitro-translated AK7 and AK8
(615365) showed highest affinity for AMP as substrate with ATP as the
phosphate donor. Both also recognized dAMP, CMP, and dCMP as substrates.
Both showed a higher affinity for AMP than the major cytosolic adenylate
kinase, AK1 (103000), but they had a much lower maximal catalytic rate
than AK1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Panayiotou et al. (2011) determined that the AK7 gene contains 18 exons
and spans 96.7 kb.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the AK7 gene to chromosome 14q32.2 based on an
alignment of the AK7 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK057426) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using transgene insertional mutagenesis, Fernandez-Gonzalez et al.
(2009) developed a line of mice that had insertion of the transgene in
intron 5 of the Ak7 gene. No Ak7 expression was detected in homozygous
transgenic (Ak7 -/-) mice. Ak7 -/- mice showed signs of primary ciliary
dyskinesia (see 244400), and about half showed severe hydrocephalus soon
after birth and died within the first month. About 25% exhibited milder
ventricular expansion and survived more than 6 weeks. At 42 days, male
Ak7 -/- mice lacked mature spermatids and spermatozoa, and electron
microscopy showed abnormal sperm heads and absence of tail structures.
At sexual maturity, male, but not female, Ak7 -/- mice were infertile.
Ak7 -/- animals also showed mucus accumulation in paranasal passages and
developed dramatic respiratory pathology upon allergen challenge.
Electron microscopic analysis of bronchial epithelial cells revealed
reduced number of motile cilia, and cilia showed axonemes with missing
central microtubule doublets and abnormal peripheral microtubules.
Morphologic defects in Ak7 -/- cilia were accompanied by significantly
reduced ciliary beat frequency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
AK7, 1-BP INS, 1214T

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to primary ciliary dyskinesia (CILD; see 244400) has
not been confirmed.

In 3 of 31 unrelated patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia, Mata et
al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 1-bp insertion (c.1214insT) in the
AK7 gene, predicted to result in a frameshift and premature termination
in the active catalytic center of the protein. The mutation was not
found in 40 control individuals. Analysis of family members of 1 of the
patients showed that his unaffected mother, father, and brother all
carried the wildtype AK7 genotype. Family members of the other 2
patients were not studied, so segregation of the mutation with the
disorder could not be determined. None of the patients had a family
history of respiratory disease. RT-PCR with primers directed against the
last 2 exons of the AK7 gene showed virtual absence of mutant AK7 mRNA
in patients with the truncating mutation. Protein quantification was not
possible due to insufficient material. Two of the patients had situs
inversus, consistent with a diagnosis of Kartagener syndrome. Analysis
of cilia showed absence of dynein in 1 patient, uncoordinated motion
pattern in 2, and motionless cilia in the third. Nasal airway epithelial
cells from 1 of the patients showed cilia, but there was a decrease in
cilia density and a decrease in beat frequency compared to controls.
Mata et al. (2012) suggested that mutation in the AK7 gene may be
associated with CILD, but also noted that the patients may have more
than 1 alteration in genes involved in the development of the disorder;
other genes were not studied in these patients. The AK7 gene was chosen
for study because homozygous Ak7-null mice develop CILD
(Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009) and patients with CILD have been shown
to have decreased expression of AK7 (Milara et al., 2010).

610038	TITLE *610038 VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 37, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, C; VPS37C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

VPS37C is a subunit of ESCRT-I (endosomal sorting complex required for
transport I), a complex in the class E vacuolar protein sorting (VPS)
pathway required for sorting ubiquitinated transmembrane proteins into
internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies (Eastman et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching a database for sequences homologous to yeast Vps37,
Stuchell et al. (2004) identified human VPS37C. The deduced 523-amino
acid protein contains a central mod(r) (modifier of rudimentary) domain
and 2 coiled-coil regions, one overlapping the N-terminal border of the
mod(r) domain and the other within the mod(r) domain.

Using TSG101 (601387) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a peripheral
mononuclear lymphocyte cDNA library, Eastman et al. (2005) cloned
VPS37C. The deduced 355-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal mod(r)
domain and a C-terminal proline-rich domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Eastman et al. (2005) found that VPS37C formed a ternary complex with
TSG101 and VPS28 (601387) by binding a C-terminal domain of TSG101.
VPS37C also bound HRS (HGS; 604375), another class E VPS factor. VPS37C
was recruited to aberrant endosomes induced by overexpression of TSG101,
HRS, or a dominant-negative form of VPS4 (VPS4A; 609982). Enveloped
viruses that encode PTAP motifs to facilitate budding, like human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Gag protein, exploit ESCRT-I as an
interface with the class E VPS pathway. VPS37C was recruited to the
plasma membrane along with TSG101 by HIV-1 Gag. Moreover, direct fusion
of VPS37C to HIV-1 Gag obviated the requirement for a PTAP motif to
induce virion release. Depletion of VPS37C from human embryonic kidney
cells did not inhibit murine leukemia virus budding, which is not
mediated by ESCRT-I. However, if murine leukemia virus budding was
engineered to be ESCRT-I-dependent, it was inhibited by VPS37C
depletion, and the inhibition was accentuated if VPS37B (610037) was
simultaneously depleted. Eastman et al. (2005) concluded that VPS37C is
a functional component of mammalian ESCRT-I.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the VPS37C
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP SHGC-31731).

606440	TITLE *606440 STEREOCILIN; STRC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The STRC gene, which encodes stereocilin, is expressed in the sensory
hair cells and is associated with the stereocilia, the stiff microvilli
forming the structure for mechanoreception of sound stimulation.
Mutation in the STRC gene results in nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness
(DFNB16; 603720).

CLONING

To identify genes mutated in hereditary deafness, Verpy et al. (2001)
developed a candidate gene approach based on the identification of genes
specifically or preferentially expressed in the inner ear. They
identified a mouse clone derived from a vestibular library that was
homologous to several human genomic clones derived from the 15q15
chromosomal region, within the locus for DFNB16. The human STRC protein
is made up of 1,809 amino acids and contains a putative signal peptide
and several hydrophobic segments. Using immunohistolabeling, Verpy et
al. (2001) demonstrated that, in the mouse inner ear, stereocilin is
expressed only in the sensory hair cells and is associated with the
stereocilia, the stiff microvilli forming the structure for
mechanoreception of sound stimulation.

GENE STRUCTURE

The STRC gene contains 29 exons, encompassing approximately 19 kb, and
is tandemly duplicated, with the coding sequence of the second copy
interrupted by a stop codon in exon 20 (Verpy et al., 2001). The 2
copies are in a telomere-to-centromere orientation, less than 100 kb
apart.

MAPPING

Verpy et al. (2001) identified the STRC gene on chromosome 15q15, within
the candidate region for DFNB16.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 families with autosomal recessive nonsyndromal sensorineural
deafness, mapped to the DFNB16 locus, Verpy et al. (2001) identified 2
frameshift mutations and a large deletion in the copy of the STRC gene
containing 29 coding exons.

Dgany et al. (2002) reported a French family in which a 56-year-old male
and his 2 brothers suffered from type I congenital dyserythropoietic
anemia (CDA) (224120), asthenoteratozoospermia, and nonsyndromic
deafness. They identified homozygosity for a point mutation within the
codanin gene (N598S; 607465.0003) as the cause of the type I CDA. Avidan
et al. (2003) found that the 3 sibs were also homozygous for an
approximately 70-kb deletion in chromosome 15q15, which removed the
entire stereocilin gene and truncated the CATSPER2 gene (607249). Avidan
et al. (2003) suggested that lack of functional stereocilin, which is
mutated in nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness, and CATSPER2, a
voltage-gated cation channel expressed exclusively in spermatozoa, may
explain the observed deafness and male infertility phenotypes,
respectively.

In 3 consanguineous Iranian families segregating nonsyndromic deafness
and male infertility (611102), Zhang et al. (2007) identified an
approximately 100-kb deleted region on chromosome 15q15.3 involving
KIAA0377 (610979), CKMT1B (123290), STRC, and CATSPER2. The families did
not have identical deletions and haplotype analysis indicated that the
families did not share a common ancestor; the authors noted that a large
tandem repeat on chromosome 15q15.3 makes it prone to rearrangement.
Zhang et al. (2007) stated that the hearing loss phenotype in these
families was similar by audioprofiling to that of DFNB16, suggesting
that deletion of STRC is causally related to their deafness.

ANIMAL MODEL

Verpy et al. (2008) detected stereocilin in association with horizontal
top connectors, lateral links that join adjacent stereocilia within the
outer hair cell's hair bundle. The authors found that these links were
absent in stereocilin-null mutant mice, which became progressively deaf.
At the onset of hearing, however, their cochlear sensitivity and
frequency tuning were almost normal, although masking was much reduced
and both acoustic and electrical waveform distortions were completely
lacking. From this unique functional situation, Verpy et al. (2008)
concluded that the main source of cochlear waveform distortions is a
deflection-dependent hair bundle stiffness resulting from constraints
imposed by the horizontal top connectors, and not from the intrinsic
nonlinear behavior of the mechanoelectrical transducer channel.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 16
STRC, 1-BP INS, 3157C

In a consanguineous family with autosomal recessive nonsyndromal
sensorineural deafness mapping to the DFNB16 locus (603720), Verpy et
al. (2001) identified an insertion of a cytosine in exon 13 at position
3157 of the STRC cDNA. This insertion, 3157insC, was expected to result
in the translocation of 19 out-of-frame amino acids and a downstream
premature termination codon at position 3214 in exon 13. The mutation
was present in homozygous form in the affected individuals.

.0002
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 16
STRC, 4-BP DEL, NT2171

In affected members of a family with autosomal recessive deafness
(603720), Verpy et al. (2001) found a 4-bp deletion in exon 5 of the
STRC gene. This mutation, 2171-2174delTTTG, also detected in the father,
was expected to result in the translation of 5 out-of-frame amino acids
and a downstream premature termination codon at position 2185 in exon 5.
Also, in both the affected children and the mother, a large deletion was
found in 1 allele of the STRC gene (606440.0003), indicating that the
affected individuals were genetic compounds.

.0003
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 16
STRC, EXON 17-29 DEL

In both the affected children and the mother of one family with
autosomal recessive nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness (603720), Verpy
et al. (2001) detected a large deletion on 1 allele of the STRC gene.
The authors located the 5-prime boundary of the deletion between intron
7 and the 3-prime end of intron 16, and the 3-prime boundary downstream
of the most 3-prime exon, indicating that the deletion extends at least
from exons 17 through 29.

103830	TITLE *103830 ALDO-KETO REDUCTASE FAMILY 1, MEMBER A1; AKR1A1
;;ALDEHYDE REDUCTASE; ALR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Aldehyde reductase (EC 1.1.1.2) and aldose reductase (EC 1.1.1.21;
103880) are monomeric NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases having wide
substrate specificities for carbonyl compounds (summary by Bohren et
al., 1989).

CLONING

Petrash et al. (1981) studied aldose reductase (AR), aldose reductase M
(ARM), and aldehyde reductase (ALR) in a variety of human tissues. Lens
aldose reductase is composed of a single subunit with molecular weight
35 kD, and liver aldehyde reductase is composed of a single subunit of
molecular weight 32 kD. Liver aldose reductase M is composed of 2
nonidentical subunits of molecular weights 35 kD and 42 kD. Lens has
only AR, liver has ARM and ALR, red cells have only ALR, while brain and
placenta have all 3 enzymes. Petrash et al. (1981) suggested that 3
loci--alpha, beta, and delta--code for these enzymes, and that AR is a
monomer of alpha polypeptide, ARM a dimer of alpha and beta subunits,
and ALR a monomer of delta polypeptide.

By screening a liver library with degenerate oligonucleotide primers
based on the protein sequence of liver aldehyde reductase, Bohren et al.
(1989) isolated aldehyde reductase cDNAs. The predicted protein contains
325 amino acids. Aldose reductase and aldehyde reductase share 3
homology domains and are 51% identical overall.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Fujii et al. (1999) mapped the
AKR1A1 gene to chromosome 1p33-p32.

613484	TITLE *613484 SPEN, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; SPEN
;;MSX2-INTERACTING NUCLEAR TARGET; MINT;;
SMART/HDAC1-ASSOCIATED REPRESSOR PROTEIN; SHARP;;
KIAA0929
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SPEN appears to function as a nuclear matrix platform that organizes and
integrates transcriptional responses (Sierra et al., 2004).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned a partial SPEN cDNA, which they
designated KIAA0929. RT-PCR ELISA detected SPEN expression in all adult
and fetal tissues and specific adult brain regions examined, with
highest expression in adult lung, liver, ovary, and spinal cord.

Newberry et al. (1999) cloned mouse Spen, which they called Mint. The
deduced 3,576-amino acid protein is rich in proline and serine and has a
calculated molecular mass of 390 kD. It has a predicted N-terminal
helical domain with 3 RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and 3 nuclear
localization signals. The C-terminal half of Mint has high coil and beta
stand content and contains an additional nuclear localization signal.
Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected a 12.6-kb transcript
that was highly expressed in testis, with lower levels in brain, spleen,
lung, liver, and kidney. It was also expressed in differentiating mouse
MC3T3E1 calvarial osteoblasts. Fractionation of MC3T3E1 cells showed
that Mint was processed into 110-kD N-terminal and 250-kD C-terminal
protein fragments that accumulated with chromatin and nuclear matrix
fractions.

Using the C terminus of the nuclear receptor corepressor SMRT (NCOR2;
600848) as bait to screen human pituitary and liver cDNA libraries, Shi
et al. (2001) cloned SPEN, which they called SHARP. The deduced
3,651-amino acid protein contains 3 N-terminal RRMs, a central receptor
interaction domain (RID), and a C-terminal SMRT interaction
domain/repression domain (SID/RD). It also contains 4 consensus nuclear
localization signals. Northern blot analysis detected a SHARP transcript
of more than 12 kb. Highest expression was in brain, testis, spleen, and
thymus, with lower expression in kidney, liver, mammary gland, and skin.
SHARP expression was also detected in several human tumor cell lines.
Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected human embryonic kidney cells
revealed SHARP in a speckled nuclear localization.

Oswald et al. (2002) reported that SHARP contains 3,664 amino acids.
They identified 4 putative N-terminal RRMs, 5 nuclear localization
signals spaced throughout the molecule, and an RBP (see RBPJ;
147183)-interacting domain following the RID.

GENE FUNCTION

Using far Western analysis, Newberry et al. (1999) found that Msx2
(123101) interacted with Mint in a mouse brain expression library. The 2
proteins cosegregated with topisomerase II (see 126430) in chromatin and
nuclear matrix fractions. Gel shift analysis showed that the Mint RRM
domain bound T- and G-rich sequences, including a large G/T inverted
repeat element in the proximal promoter of rat osteocalcin (OC, or
BGLAP; 112260). Transient expression of the Mint N-terminal domain
suppressed FGF (see 131220)/forskolin-activated Oc promoter. Mint
expression was downregulated with differentiation of MC3T3E1 cells,
concomitant with upregulation of the Oc gene.

Sierra et al. (2004) showed that mouse Mint synergized with Runx2
(600211) to enhance Fgfr2 (176943)-mediated activation of the
osteocalcin FGF-responsive element (OCFRE). The RRM domain of Mint and
activation domain-3 of Runx2 were required for this activity. Confocal
immunofluorescence microscopy showed that nuclear colocalization of Mint
and Runx2 was enhanced by Fgf2 (134920) stimulation, and Mint enhanced
Runx2 activation of multiprotein complexes assembled by the OCFRE. Msx2
functioned as an inhibitor of Runx2-Mint activation of OCFRE. Sierra et
al. (2004) concluded that MINT may serve as a nuclear matrix platform
that organizes and integrates transcriptional responses.

By coimmunoprecipitation of transfected epitope-tagged proteins and by
protein pull-down assays, Shi et al. (2001) showed that SHARP interacted
directly with HDAC1 (601241). HDAC1 readily coimmunoprecipitated with
SHARP and with at least 5 members of the NuRD complex (see MTA1;
603526), and SHARP immunocomplexes displayed histone deacetylase
activity. SHARP also interacted with steroid receptor RNA cofactor SRA
(603819) and repressed SRA-potentiated steroid receptor activity. SHARP
expression was induced in MCF-7 breast cancer cells by estrogen E2
treatment. Shi et al. (2001) concluded that SHARP can function as a
cofactor for both coactivators and corepressors.

The DNA-binding protein CBF1 (RBPJ; 147183) is a transcriptional
repressor. By yeast 2-hybrid screening of embryonic human liver,
followed by protein pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays, Oswald
et al. (2002) showed that SHARP interacted directly with CBF1 (RBPJ;
147183), a DNA-binding transcriptional repressor. In cotransfection
experiments, SHARP repressed transcription in an HDAC-dependent fashion
and inhibited transactivation mediated by Notch1 (190198).
Overexpression of SHARP in Xenopus embryos induced a neurogenic
phenotype and rescued loss of primary neurogenesis resulting from
overexpression of dominant-active Notch1. Oswald et al. (2002) concluded
that SHARP is recruited by CBF1 to an HDAC corepressor complex that
regulates the Notch signaling pathway.

Salat et al. (2008) found that ETO (RUNX1T1; 133435) interacted directly
with the RD of SHARP in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human fetal brain
library. ETO also coimmunoprecipitated with RBPJ and SHARP from HEL
cells. Mutation analysis revealed that NHR1 and NHR2 of ETO interacted
with the RD of SHARP. ETO and SHARP colocalized with RBPJ at promoter
regions of Notch target genes. ETO expression augmented SHARP-mediated
repression of reporter gene expression in an HDAC-dependent manner.
Pharmacologic inhibition of HDAC activity completely abrogated the
repressive activity of ETO-RBPJ-SHARP in reporter gene activation.
Knockdown of ETO activated Notch target genes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the SPEN gene to chromosome 1p36.13 based on an
alignment of the SPEN sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB023146) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

148043	TITLE *148043 KERATIN 3; KRT3
;;K3;;
CYTOKERATIN 3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cytokeratins (keratins) comprise a large family of peptides that combine
to form the intermediate filaments (10-nm fibers) present in the
cytoskeleton in epithelial cells. Type I cytokeratins are acidic and
range from molecular weight 40 to 56.5 kD, whereas type II cytokeratins
are neutral or basic and have molecular weights of 53 to 67 kD. Specific
pairs of heterotypic keratin chains are coexpressed during the various
stages of epithelial differentiation. This pattern of expression of
cytokeratin pairs implies the existence of highly coordinated control of
transcription. The gene for cytokeratin 3 (KRT3), a member of the type
II subfamily, is expressed together with KRT12 (601687) during
'corneal-type' differentiation (Moll et al., 1982; Schermer et al.,
1986; summary by Raimondi et al., 1994).

GENE STRUCTURE

The KRT3 gene is approximately 6.5 kb long and encodes one of the
largest cytokeratin proteins (64 kD) (summary by Raimondi et al., 1994).

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Raimondi et al. (1994) mapped the
KRT3 gene to chromosome 12q12-q13. All type II keratin genes mapped to
that time had been assigned to chromosome 12 where they appeared to be
organized into one homotypic cluster.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Meesmann corneal dystrophy (122100) is an autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by fragility of the anterior corneal epithelium where the
KRT12 and KRT3 genes are specifically expressed. Cytoplasmic densities
demonstrated in Meesmann corneal dystrophy (Tremblay and Dube, 1982) are
reminiscent of the tonofilament clumping seen in other dominant keratin
disorders. Furthermore, in K12 knockout mice, a complete loss of the
K3/K12 cytoskeleton results in extreme fragility of corneal
keratinocytes (Kao et al., 1996). Irvine et al. (1997) postulated that
dominant-negative mutations in keratins K3 and K12 might cause Meesmann
corneal dystrophy. They indeed found such mutations. In a Northern
Ireland family they demonstrated linkage between KRT3 and this form of
corneal dystrophy and demonstrated a specific mutation, E509K
(148043.0001), in the KRT3 gene.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MEESMANN CORNEAL DYSTROPHY
KRT3, GLU509LYS

In a family in Northern Ireland, Irvine et al. (1997) demonstrated that
members with Meesmann corneal dystrophy (MECD; 122100) were heterozygous
for a 1525G-A transition in the KRT3 gene, resulting in a glu509-to-lys
(E509K) substitution. This purine transition was a potential CpG
deamination mutation. An identical CpG mutation in the analogous residue
of the KRT2 gene (600194) is the most frequent cause of ichthyosis
bullosa of Siemens (146800).

615262	TITLE *615262 METHYLTRANSFERASE-LIKE 23; METTL23
;;CHROMOSOME 17 OPEN READING FRAME 95; C17ORF95
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from a donor,
generally S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), to acceptor molecules,
including proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids, and small metabolites. METTL23
belongs to a family of protein lysine methyltransferases that methylate
nonhistone proteins (Cloutier et al., 2013).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to METTL22 (615261),
Cloutier et al. (2013) identified METTL23. The deduced protein is made
up predominantly of a Rossmann fold of alternating beta strands and
alpha helices, with a conserved AdoMet-binding site near the N terminus.
Epitope-tagged METTL23 was predominantly expressed in cytoplasmic
membrane-like structures in transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By affinity purification, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry, Cloutier et
al. (2013) found that METTL23 expressed in HEK293 cells interacted with
HSPA5 (138120), tubulin (see 602529), and UGGT1 (605897). UGGT2 (605898)
and HSP90B1 (191175) were also detected in the immunoprecipitate.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the METTL23 gene to chromosome 17q25.1 based on an
alignment of the METTL23 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC033998) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

609473	TITLE *609473 CINGULIN, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF; CGN
;;KIAA1319
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned CGN, which they designated
KIAA1319. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest CGN expression in liver, testis,
and lung. Intermediate expression was detected in ovary, pancreas,
spinal cord, whole adult brain, fetal liver and brain, and all specific
brain regions examined. No expression was detected in heart, skeletal
muscle, and spleen.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to Xenopus cingulin,
Citi et al. (2000) identified human cingulin. The deduced 1,203-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 137 kD. Cingulin
contains a globular N-terminal head region, a central coiled-coil rod
domain, and a short C-terminal tail. It has a leucine zipper motif,
classical and bipartite nuclear localization signals, and several
potential phosphorylation sites. Human and Xenopus cingulin share 43%
amino acid identity, with highest similarity in the C-terminal tail and
lowest similarity in the N-terminal head domain. Northern blot analysis
detected a 5.2-kb transcript in pancreas, kidney, liver, and lung, but
not in skeletal muscle, placenta, brain, and heart.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Citi et al. (2000) determined that each cingulin molecule is likely to
be a dimer, with the alpha-helical sequences of each subunit assembled
in parallel axial register to form a 2-stranded coiled-coil. Cingulin
dimers may further assemble through antiparallel interactions between
the last 100 amino acids of the coiled-coil region.

GENE FUNCTION

Citi et al. (2000) found that both human and Xenopus cingulin interacted
with canine Zo1 (TJP1; 601009) and Zo2 (TJP2; 607709) in an in vitro
pull-down assay.

D'Atri et al. (2002) found that overexpression of Xenopus cingulin in
transfected Xenopus epithelial cells resulted in disruption of
endogenous Zo1 localization. Pull-down experiments with truncated
Xenopus and human cingulin showed that the N-terminal motifs
independently bound Zo1 and Zo2. Deletion of the Zo1 interaction motif
did not abolish junctional localization of cingulin in transfected
Xenopus epithelial cells, indicating that multiple protein interactions
can recruit cingulin to tight junctions in these cells. D'Atri et al.
(2002) demonstrated that the coiled-coil region of cingulin acts
primarily to promote dimerization.

RhoA (ARHA; 165390) is downregulated when epithelial cells reach
confluence, resulting in inhibition of signaling pathways that stimulate
proliferation. By coimmunoprecipitation, Aijaz et al. (2005) identified
cingulin as a binding partner of endogenous Gefh1 (ARHGEF2; 607560), a
guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RhoA, in Madin-Darby canine
kidney (MDCK) cells. Cingulin binding inhibited RhoA activation and
signaling, suggesting that the increase in cingulin expression in
confluent cells inhibits Gefh1 and thereby downregulates RhoA. In
agreement, RNA interference of Gefh1 or transfection of a mutant Gefh1
unable to bind cingulin inhibited G1/S phase transition in MDCK cells.
Depletion of cingulin by regulated RNA interference resulted in RhoA
activation and the development of irregular cell monolayers. Aijaz et
al. (2005) concluded that the formation of epithelial tight junctions
contributes to the downregulation of RhoA by inactivating Gefh1 in a
cingulin-dependent manner.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Citi et al. (2000) mapped the CGN gene to
chromosome 1q21.

PHENOL SULFOTRANSFERASE, THERMOSTABLE FORM; STP;;
ST1A3;;
PHENOL SULFOTRANSFERASE; PPST
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The SULT1A1 gene encodes a phenol sulfotransferase (STP, or PST) (EC
2.8.2.1), which catalyzes the sulfate conjugation of catecholamines and
of phenolic drugs. There are 3 phenol-preferring SULT isoforms encoded
by 3 genes, SULT1A1, SULT1A2 (601292), and SULT1A3 (600641), which have
also been referred to as STP1, STP2, and STM, respectively. These genes
are highly homologous and are located within a 120-kb region on
chromosome 16p. SULT enzymes are widely distributed in human and animal
tissues, including blood platelets (summary by Raftogianis et al.,
1997).

CLONING

Wilborn et al. (1993) cloned cDNAs encoding SULT1A1, which they called
PPST, from a human liver cDNA library. The full-length cDNA encodes a
deduced 295-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 34.1
kD. The rat and human proteins share 89% amino acid similarity. Northern
blot analysis of human liver detected a 1.3-kb mRNA transcript.

Using PCR, Jones et al. (1995) cloned PPST from human platelet and liver
cDNA libraries.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dooley and Huang (1996) determined the genomic organization of the human
SULT1A1, SULT1A2, and SULT1A3 genes. These 3 genes each have 8 exons
with the initiator methionine in exon 2. All 3 colocalize on a single
cosmid and have a high degree of sequence homology, suggesting that
these 3 genes arose by gene duplication. Dooley and Huang (1996) stated
that the previously identified PST gene sequences PPST, HPST, HAST1, and
HAST2 are isolates of the SULT1A1 gene.

Wilborn et al. (1993) determined that SULT1A1 has 3 putative
polyadenylation signal sequences.

MAPPING

By screening DNA samples from a human-hamster somatic cell hybrid panel
by PCR using an oligonucleotide primer pair, Dooley et al. (1993) mapped
the SULT1A1 gene to human chromosome 16p. PCR amplification on a
human-mouse somatic cell hybrid panel containing defined portions of
chromosome 16 showed that SULT1A1 is located proximal to the gene for
protein kinase C, beta-1 polypeptide (176970), in the region
16p12.1-p11.2.

Her et al. (1996) identified a second thermostable phenol
sulfotransferase, SULT1A2, which also maps to chromosome 16; see 601292.
Raftogianis et al. (1996) found that the SULT1A1 gene is located
approximately 45 kb 5-prime upstream from the SULT1A2 gene.

By interspecific backcross analysis, Dooley et al. (1993) mapped the
mouse Sult1a1 gene to chromosome 7. Khan et al. (1995) also mapped the
Sult1a1 gene to mouse chromosome 7.

GENE FUNCTION

Wilborn et al. (1993) observed significant increases in sulfotransferase
activity toward 2 PST-specific substrates, minoxidil and 4-nitrophenol,
in cytosol prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with human PPST. PPST
appeared to function as a homodimer.

By assaying transfected Chinese hamster fibroblasts, Jones et al. (1995)
showed that cytosolic human PPST sulfated 1-naphthol, 4-nitrophenol, and
phenol. It showed lower activity with tyramine, dopamine, noradrenalin,
and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol, and had no activity toward
dehydroepiandrosterone and estrone.

Kester et al. (1999) investigated sulfation of the prohormone T4, the
active hormone T3, and the metabolites rT3 and 3,3-prime-diiodothyronine
(3,3-prime-T2) by human liver and kidney cytosol sulfotransferases as
well as by recombinant human SULT1A1 and SULT1A3. In all cases, the most
preferred substrate was 3,3-prime-T2, followed by rT3, T3, and T4 (most
preferred to least preferred, respectively). These results indicated
similar substrate specificities for iodothyronine sulfation by native
human liver and kidney sulfotransferases and recombinant SULT1A1 and
SULT1A3. Of the latter, SULT1A1 clearly showed the highest affinity for
iodothyronines, but it remained to be established whether SULT1A1 is the
prominent isoenzyme for sulfation of thyroid hormone in human liver and
kidney.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Gamage et al. (2003) solved the crystal structure of SULT1A1 to
1.9-angstrom resolution. They found that, like other SULTs, SULT1A1
formed a central 5-stranded parallel beta sheet surrounded on either
side by helices. The L-shaped substrate-binding site was highly
hydrophobic and accommodated 2 p-nitrophenol molecules. Kinetic analysis
revealed a slight deviation from Michaelis-Menten kinetics at low
concentrations of p-nitrophenol, suggestive of positive cooperativity,
although higher concentrations resulted in substrate inhibition. The
substrate-binding site accepted a single T2 molecule, with the 2 phenyl
rings of T2 occupying each of the 2 p-nitrophenol-binding sites. The
substrate 17-beta-estradiol caused a conformational change in the
SULT1A1 substrate-binding site, suggesting that this rearrangement
underlies the low affinity SULT1A1 shows toward this sterol.

Using molecular modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic
analysis, Barnett et al. (2004) showed that phe247 of SULT1A1 interacted
with both p-nitrophenol molecules in the active site and was required
for substrate inhibition.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Evidence that inheritance contributes to differences in levels of the 2
forms of the SULT1A1 enzyme in Caucasians was presented by Reveley et
al. (1982), Price et al. (1988), and Van Loon and Weinshilboum (1984).

Anderson and Jackson (1984) showed that the mean basal level of platelet
thermostable PST (TS PST) activity in American blacks is significantly
higher than the mean basal level in whites, whereas the average platelet
thermolabile PST activity does not differ significantly between the 2
groups. Anderson et al. (1988) suggested that the findings are a first
step toward testing the hypothesis that inheritance may be a factor in
the regulation of basal levels of activity and thermostability of
platelet PST.

Raftogianis et al. (1997) identified a common variant allele of the
SULT1A1 gene, termed SULT1A1*2 (dbSNP rs9282861), that was uniformly
associated with both very low TS PST activity and low thermal stability.
The variant allele, 638G-A transition in exon 7, resulted in an
arg213-to-his (R213H) substitution. The allele frequency of SULT1A1*2 in
a population sample of 150 Caucasian blood donors was 0.31 (31%),
indicating that approximately 9% of this population would be homozygous
for that allele. Overall, Raftogianis et al. (1997) identified 13
SULT1A1 alleles encoding 4 allozymes.

Coughtrie et al. (1999) found the variant SULT1A1*2 allele at
frequencies of 0.321 and 0.269 in 293 U.K. Caucasian and 52 Nigerian
African individuals, respectively. This allele codes for an allozyme
with low enzyme activity and stability compared to the wildtype
(SULT1A1*1) enzyme. Therefore, the SULT1A1 genotype may influence
susceptibility to mutagenicity following exposure to heterocyclic amines
and other environmental toxins. Accordingly, Coughtrie et al. (1999)
found an age-related difference in SULT1A1 genotype within the Caucasian
population, with increasing incidence of SULT1A1*1 homozygosity and
decreasing incidence of SULT1A1*2 homozygosity with increasing age.
These findings suggested a possible association of SULT1A1*1 allozyme
with protection against cell or tissue damage during aging.

Bamber et al. (2001) compared the frequency of the most common SULT1A1
alleles in 226 colorectal cancer patients and 293 previously described
control patients. There was no significant difference in allele
frequency between the control and cancer patient populations, nor was
there a significant association with any of the clinical parameters
studied, including Duke classification, differentiation, site, nodal
involvement, and survival. However, when the age-related difference in
allele frequency was considered, a significantly reduced risk of
colorectal cancer was associated with homozygosity for SULT1A1*1 (odds
ratio = 0.47) in subjects under the age of 80 years. These results
suggested that the high activity SULT1A1*1 alloallele protects against
dietary and/or environmental chemicals involved in the pathogenesis of
colorectal cancer.

Using a quantitative multiplex PCR assay, Hebbring et al. (2007) found
that 17 (4.7%) of 362 Caucasian American individuals had 1 copy of the
SULT1A1 gene (i.e., a deletion) and 26% had 3 or more copies. Among 99
African Americans tested, 62 (62.6%) had 3 or more copies. The
variability in the level of enzyme activity among 23 human platelet and
267 human liver samples was best explained by gene copy number
differences when all sources of genetic variability, including the
SULT1A1*2 allele, were considered (p less than 0.0001). Overall, these
results indicated that the presence of SULT1A1 gene deletions and
duplications represent the major source of variability in the metabolic
activity of this enzyme.

HISTORY

Early studies showed the existence of 2 phenol SULT isoforms based on
biochemical studies: a thermolabile, or monoamine-metabolizing (SULT1A3;
600641), form and a thermostable, or phenol-metabolizing, form (SULT1A1)
(summary by Raftogianis et al., 1997).

120105	TITLE *120105 COLIPASE, PANCREATIC; CLPS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pancreatic colipase is a 12-kD polypeptide cofactor for pancreatic
lipase (EC 3.1.1.3; 246600), an enzyme essential for the absorption of
dietary long-chain triglyceride fatty acids. Colipase is thought to
anchor lipase noncovalently to the surface of lipid micelles,
counteracting the destabilizing influence of intestinal bile salts
(summary by Davis et al., 1991).

CLONING

Using primers derived from the known amino acid sequence, Davis et al.
(1991) employed the PCR to produce a cDNA clone corresponding to the
complete coding region of the human procolipase mRNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sims and Lowe (1992) found that the CLPS gene has 3 exons and that the
5-prime-flanking region contains a TATA box, a GC box, and a 28-bp
region with homology to the rat pancreatic-specific enhancer.

MAPPING

By the study of mouse/human somatic cell hybrids, Davis et al. (1991)
determined that the CLPS gene is located in the region 6pter-p21.1.

Sims and Lowe (1992) confirmed the assignment of the CLPS gene to
chromosome 6 by blots of hamster-human somatic cell hybrid DNA using the
entire colipase cDNA.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhang et al. (2006) reported a mechanism by which constant darkness
regulates the gene expression of fat catabolic enzymes in mice. Genes
for murine procolipase (Clps) and pancreatic lipase-related protein-2
(Plrp2; 604423) are activated in a circadian manner in peripheral organs
during 12-hour dark:12-hour dark (DD) but not light-dark (LD) cycles.
This mechanism is deregulated in circadian-deficient Per1/Per2 double
mutant mice. Zhang et al. (2006) identified circadian-regulated
5-prime-AMP, which is elevated in the blood of DD mice, as a key
mediator of this response. Synthetic 5-prime-AMP induced torpor (a
hibernation-like state) and murine Clps expression in LD mice. Torpor
induced by metabolic stress was associated with elevated 5-prime-AMP
levels in DD mice. Levels of glucose and nonesterified fatty acid in the
blood were reversed in DD and LD mice. Induction of murine Clps
expression by 5-prime-AMP in LD mice was reciprocally linked to blood
glucose levels. Zhang et al. (2006) concluded that their findings
uncovered a circadian metabolic rhythm in mammals.

607707	TITLE *607707 CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE II-BETA; CAMK2B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CAMK2B belongs to a family of type II multifunctional calcium- and
calmodulin (see 114180)-dependent protein kinases. There are at least 4
CAMK2 genes, and each yields several isoforms through alternative
splicing. CAMK2B is a prominent kinase in the central nervous system and
may function in long-term potentiation and neurotransmitter release.

CLONING

Tombes and Krystal (1997) cloned a number of CAMK2B variants from
several human tumor cell line and brain cDNA libraries. CAMK2B showed
wide tissue and cell distribution, but 1 variant predominated in adult
brain. The expression of other variants depended upon the tissue of
origin and whether the source was normal or tumor tissue.

By searching an EST database using rat Camk2 as query, followed by
screening a brain cDNA library, Li et al. (2001) obtained a full-length
cDNA encoding CAMK2B. The deduced protein contains 542 amino acids. A
comparison of CAMK2B and CAMK2A (114078) detected no amino acid changes
within the functional domains, including the ATP-binding site, the
calmodulin-binding domain, and autophosphorylation sites. Northern blot
analysis detected a major 3.9-kb transcript in adult and fetal brain;
expression was slightly lower in fetal brain. Using PCR primers designed
to identify alternatively spliced isoforms, Li et al. (2001) identified
3 CAMK2B isoforms in adult and fetal brain. Like other CAMK2 isoforms,
the CAMK2B isoforms have an insertion or deletion of 11 to 39 amino
acids within the central variable region.

Wang et al. (2000) identified and cloned CAMK2B by searching an EST
database using mouse Camk2b. They obtained a full-length cDNA by 5-prime
RACE of a brain cDNA library. Wang et al. (2000) also identified 5
splice variants resulting from alternative splicing within 7 central
variable domains, termed V1 to V7. The deduced proteins have calculated
molecular masses between 49 and 60 kD. Transient transfection of 3
CAMK2B variants in HEK293 cells revealed that all 3 were cytosolic
proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2000) showed that full-length CAMK2B and a variant lacking
V1 displayed Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase activity against a
peptide substrate. Another variant lacking V1 through V5 did not exhibit
significant kinase activity under the same conditions.

By Western blot analysis, Thiagarajan et al. (2002) found that the
protein levels of Camk2a and Camk2b were inversely related during
activity in cultured rat pup hippocampal neurons. The levels of Camk2a
increased with heightened activity, and the levels of Camk2b increased
with suppression of activity. Thiagarajan et al. (2002) hypothesized
that the change in the ratio may help tune the Camk2 holoenzyme to
changing intensities of Ca(2+) signaling.

Novak et al. (2000) determined that expression of CAMK2B mRNA was
elevated about 2-fold in postmortem frontal cortex of schizophrenia
(181500) patients relative to controls.

Konig et al. (2010) used an integrative systems approach, based on
genomewide RNA interference screening, to identify 295 cellular
cofactors required for early-stage influenza virus replication. Within
this group, those involved in kinase-regulated signaling,
ubiquitination, and phosphatase activity are the most highly enriched,
and 181 factors assemble into a highly significant host-pathogen
interaction network. Moreover, 219 of the 295 factors were confirmed to
be required for efficient wildtype influenza virus growth, and further
analysis of a subset of genes showed 23 factors essential for viral
entry, including members of the vacuolar ATPase (see 192132) and COPI
(see 601924) protein families, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)
proteins, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-beta (605004).
Furthermore, 10 proteins were confirmed to be involved in post-entry
steps of influenza virus replication. These include nuclear import
components, proteases, and CAMK2B. Notably, growth of swine-origin HIN1
influenza virus is also dependent on the identified host factors, and
Konig et al. (2010) showed that small molecule inhibitors of several
factors, including vATPase and CAMK2B, antagonize influenza virus
replication.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang et al. (2000) determined that the variable region of the CAMK2B
protein is encoded by at least 7 exons. Alternative splicing within this
region gives rise to CAMK2B variants.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wang et al. (2000) mapped the CAMK2B gene
to chromosome 7.

602235	TITLE *602235 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-GATED, KQT-LIKE SUBFAMILY, MEMBER 2; KCNQ2
;;POTASSIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-GATED, SUBFAMILY Q, MEMBER 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The KCNQ2 gene encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel that is
expressed in the brain (Biervert et al., 1998).

CLONING

In the course of a search for the mutational basis of benign familial
neonatal seizures (BFNS1; 121200) mapping to chromosome 20, Singh et al.
(1998) identified a novel voltage-gated potassium channel gene that
showed significant homology to KVLQT1 (also known as KCNQ1 and KCNA9),
the chromosome 11 potassium channel gene responsible for long QT
syndrome-1 (192500) and a form of Jervell and Lange-Nielsen
cardioauditory syndrome (220400). A single cDNA isolated with the D20S24
probe in this region showed significant homology with KVLQT1. Singh et
al. (1998) found that the KCNQ2 cDNA hybridized to transcripts of
approximately 1.5, 3.8, and 9.5 kb on Northern blots made from brain.

By positional cloning from the 20q13.3 region where 1 form of benign
familial neonatal seizures is known to map, Biervert et al. (1998)
independently isolated the KCNQ2 gene and found that it was expressed in
brain.

Yang et al. (1998) described the cloning, tissue distribution, and
functional expression of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 (602232), both of which are
associated with benign neonatal epilepsy. The deduced 871-amino acid
KCNQ2 protein has features of a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Northern blot analysis of 8 human tissues detected an 8.5-kb KCNQ2
transcript in brain only. Within brain, highest expression of KCNQ2 was
detected in cerebellar cortex, amygdala, caudate nucleus, and
hippocampus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Biervert and Steinlein (1999) determined that the KCNQ2 gene has at
least 18 exons, occupying more than 50 kb of genomic DNA. Splice
variants were identified. For example, in fetal brain, exon 8 was absent
in all transcripts, while this exon was present in clones derived from
adult brain RNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Biervert et al. (1998) found that expression of human KCNQ2 in Xenopus
laevis oocytes led to potassium-selective currents that activated slowly
with depolarization.

The M channel is a slowly activating and deactivating potassium
conductance that plays a critical role in determining the subthreshold
electroexcitability of neurons as well as the responsiveness to synaptic
inputs. The M current was first described in peripheral sympathetic
neurons, and differential expression of this conductance produces
subtypes of sympathetic neurons with distinct firing patterns. The M
channel is also expressed in many neurons in the central nervous system.
Wang et al. (1998) showed that the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 channel subunits can
coassemble to form a channel with essentially identical biophysical
properties and pharmacologic sensitivities to the native M channel and
that the pattern of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 gene expression is consistent with
these genes encoding the native M channel.

Yang et al. (1998) demonstrated that KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, both of which are
associated with benign neonatal epilepsy, interact functionally with
each other and with KCNE1 (176261), which is mutant in a form of Jervell
and Lange-Nielsen syndrome and in 1 form of long QT syndrome.

Cooper et al. (2000) provided information regarding the in vivo
distribution and biochemical characteristics of human brain KCNQ2 and
KCNQ3, the 2 channel subunits that form M channels when expressed in
vitro, and, when mutated, cause the dominantly inherited epileptic
syndrome, benign familial neonatal seizures. They found that the KCNQ2
and KCNQ3 proteins are colocalized in a somatodendritic pattern on
pyramidal and polymorphic neurons in the human cortex and hippocampus.
Immunoreactivity for KCNQ2, but not KCNQ3, is also prominent in some
terminal fields, suggesting a presynaptic role for a distinct subgroup
of M channels in the regulation of action potential propagation and
neurotransmitter release. KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 could be coimmunoprecipitated
from brain lysates. Further, both proteins were coassociated with
tubulin (see 602529) and protein kinase A (see 176911) within a triton
X-100-insoluble protein complex. Cooper et al. (2000) suggested that
these studies provided a view of a signaling complex that may be
important for cognitive function as well as epilepsy, and that analysis
of this complex may shed light on the transduction pathway linking
muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (see 118510) activation to M-channel
inhibition.

By recording channel currents produced in cRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes,
Zhang et al. (2003) found that phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate
(PIP2) activated all members of the KCNQ channel family analyzed,
including human KCNQ2 and heterodimers of human KCNQ2 and rat Kcnq3.
Similar results were obtained with mammalian cells expressing KCNQ2 and
Kcnq3. Mutation of his328-to-cys in KCNQ2 and his330-to-cys in Kcnq3
reduced or eliminated PIP2-mediated channel activation. Wortmannin, a
pharmacologic inhibitor of PIP2 regeneration, slowed the recovery from
PIP2 hydrolysis and decreased the sensitivity of the KCNQ2/Kcnq3 channel
to PIP2. Zhang et al. (2003) concluded that PIP2 acts as a
membrane-diffusible second messenger to regulate the activity of KCNQ
currents.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Benign Familial Neonatal Seizures 1

In affected members of a family with benign familial neonatal seizures-1
(BFNS1; 121200), Singh et al. (1998) identified a small deletion on
chromosome 20q encompassing the KCNQ2 gene. The finding was confirmed by
fluorescence in situ hybridization in an affected individual who
presented with seizures beginning at 3 days and had 118 generalized
seizures until the age of 23 days. A single seizure was observed at 3.5
months in conjunction with an acute infection of the middle ear with
fever, but no seizures were observed thereafter. Singh et al. (1998)
also identified different heterozygous mutations in the KCNQ2 gene (see,
e.g., 602235.0001 and 602235.0002) in additional families with BFNS1.

In a large pedigree with BFNS1, Biervert et al. (1998) found a 5-bp
insertion (602235.0003) that was predicted to delete more than 300 amino
acids from the C terminus of KCNQ2. Expression of the mutant channel did
not yield measurable currents. Thus, impairment of potassium-dependent
repolarization was indicated as the cause of this age-specific epileptic
syndrome.

Dedek et al. (2001) reported a Caucasian family in which BFNS was
followed later in life by myokymia, involuntary contractions of skeletal
muscles (see 121200). All affected members of the family carried an
arg207-to-trp mutation (R207W; 602235.0006) that neutralized a charged
amino acid in the S4 voltage-sensor segment of KCNQ2. This substitution
led to a shift of voltage-dependent activation of KCNQ2 and a dramatic
slowing of activation upon depolarization. Myokymia was thought to
result from hyperexcitability of the lower motoneuron; indeed both KCNQ2
and KCNQ3 mRNAs were detected in the anterior horn of the spinal cord
where the cells of the lower motoneurons arise. Dedek et al. (2001)
proposed that a difference in firing patterns between motoneurons and
central neurons, combined with the drastically slowed voltage activation
of the R207W mutant, explained by this particular KCNQ2 mutant caused
myokymia in addition to BFNC. Wuttke et al. (2007) identified a mutation
in the KCNQ2 gene (R207Q; 602235.0011) in a patient with isolated
myokymia.

Heron et al. (2007) identified 3 deletions and 1 duplication of more
than 1 exon of the KCNQ2 gene in 4 (44%) of 9 unrelated families with
benign familial neonatal seizures who had previously tested negative for
coding or splice site mutations. The changes were predicted to result in
haploinsufficiency. The authors suggested that multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) should be a second-tier
testing strategy in candidate cases.

- Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 7

In a mother and son with severe epilepsy, Dedek et al. (2003) identified
a heterozygous mutation in the KCNQ2 gene (602235.0008). Both patients
had an atypical course characterized by drug-resistant seizures
necessitating ACTH treatment. In addition, the son developed early
infantile epileptic encephalopathy with delayed psychomotor development
(EIEE7; 613720). Functional expression studies showed that the S247W
mutation reduced channel currents by more than 50% in homomeric KCNQ2
channels. Dedek et al. (2003) emphasized that some KCNQ2 mutations may
be associated with a more severe phenotype than is typical for BFNC.

Weckhuysen et al. (2012) identified 7 different heterozygous mutations
in the KCNQ2 gene (see, e.g., 602235.0012-602235.0014) in 8 (10%) of 80
patients with neonatal or early infantile seizures and associated
psychomotor retardation. The mutations arose de novo in 7 cases; in 1
case, a severely affected patient inherited the mutation from her
father, who had a milder phenotype and was mosaic for the mutation. The
findings indicated that KCNQ2 mutations can occur in a substantial
proportion of patients with EIEE.

ANIMAL MODEL

The electroconvulsive threshold (ECT) test has been used extensively to
determine the protection conferred by antiepileptic drug candidates
against induced seizures in rodents. Yang et al. (2003) adopted the ECT
test to screen the progeny of ethylnitrosourea-treated male C57BL/6J
mice. In a small-scale screen, several mutant lines conferring a low
threshold to ECT minimal clonic seizures were mapped to the telomeric
region of mouse chromosome 2 in independent founder families. Genetic
and physical mapping data indicated that several lines shared a single
mutation, Szt1 (seizure threshold-1), consisting of a 300-kb deletion of
genomic DNA involving 3 known genes. Two of these genes, Kcnq2 and
Chrna4 (118504), are known to be mutated in human epilepsy families.
Szt1 homozygotes and heterozygotes displayed similar phenotypes to those
found in the respective Kcnq2 knockout mutant mice, suggesting that
Kcnq2 haploinsufficiency may lie at the root of the Szt1 seizure
sensitivity.

In affected members of a family with benign familial neonatal seizures
(121200), Singh et al. (1998) demonstrated a TAC-to-TGC transition
converting codon 284 from tyrosine to cysteine. The family was too small
to permit demonstration of linkage to chromosome 20. The mutation
occurred in the pore region of the channel.

In their BFNS kindred 1705, Singh et al. (1998) demonstrated that
individuals affected with benign familial neonatal seizures (121200) had
an ala306-to-thr (A306T) amino acid substitution in the S6 transmembrane
segment. This alanine residue was conserved in all members of the
Shaker, Shab, Shaw, and Shal subfamilies of potassium channels.

KCNQ2, 5-BP INS

Biervert et al. (1998) identified an insertional mutation in the KCNQ2
gene in a large Australian Caucasian pedigree with benign familial
neonatal seizures (121200) previously reported by Berkovic et al.
(1994). Biervert et al. (1998) found a heterozygous 5-bp insertion at
the triplet encoding amino acid 534 in a segment highly conserved
between KCNQ2 and KCNQ1 (607542), which is mutated in type 1 long QT
syndrome (192500). The resulting frameshift was predicted to cause a
premature stop, which would truncate more than 300 amino acids. Of 13
affected family members, 10 had known neonatal seizures. Two patients
had afebrile seizures later, 1 of whom did not have neonatal seizures.
One mutation carrier was unaffected, indicating reduced penetrance.
Berkovic et al. (1994) noted the phenotypic heterogeneity in this
family.

KCNQ2, 1-BP DEL, 1846T

In a patient with benign familial neonatal seizures (121200), Biervert
and Steinlein (1999) identified a 1-bp deletion, 1846delT, in the KCNQ2
gene which caused a frameshift in exon 16, removing 228 amino acids from
the predicted wildtype sequence and replacing them with a stretch of 283
amino acids showing a completely different sequence. The mutation was
also present in the DNA sample obtained from the father but not in that
from the mother. The paternal grandmother reportedly had also suffered
from neonatal seizures but was not available for study.

KCNQ2, ARG214TRP

In a 4-generation Italian family segregating benign familial neonatal
seizures (121200), del Giudice et al. (2000) identified a 686C-T
mutation in exon 3 of the KCNQ2 gene, resulting in an arg214-to-trp
substitution. The mutation was found in the 8 affected members of the
pedigree and in 1 unaffected subject who was an obligate carrier. The
mutation occurred in the transmembrane domain S4, neutralizing one of
the conserved, positively charged residues of that segment. The
substitution abolished an AgeI restriction site and was not detected in
150 Italian controls.

SEIZURES, BENIGN FAMILIAL NEONATAL, 1, AND/OR MYOKYMIA
KCNQ2, ARG207TRP

In 5 affected members of a Caucasian family with BFNS and/or myokymia
(see 121200), Dedek et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous C-to-T
transition in exon 3 of the KCNQ2 gene, resulting in an arg207-to-trp
(R207W) substitution in the fourth transmembrane domain. Three mutation
carriers had BFNS with myokymia, 1 had isolated myokymia without
seizures, and 1 had neonatal seizures with no clinical signs of
myokymia, although electromyography demonstrated spontaneous discharges
of grouped motor unit potentials. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutation resulted in a shift of voltage-dependent
activation of KCNQ2 and a dramatic slowing of activation upon
depolarization. The loss of potassium current was more severe compared
to other KCNQ2 mutations and showed a dominant-negative effect.

In a patient with isolated myokymia and no history of neonatal seizures,
Wuttke et al. (2007) identified an R207Q mutation (602235.0011) in the
same codon as the R207W mutation. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that mutant R207W and R207Q channels had large depolarizing
shifts and marked slowing of activation time compared to wildtype
channels. Coexpression with wildtype channels showed a dominant-negative
effect reducing the current amplitude by 70% after short depolarization.

KCNQ2, LYS526ASN

In 4 affected members of a family with BFNS1 (121200), Borgatti et al.
(2004) identified a heterozygous 1620G-A transition in the KCNQ2 gene,
resulting in a lys526-to-asn (K526N) substitution in the C-terminal
region of the protein. The mutation is located in a highly conserved
region within alpha-helix B that is necessary for calmodulin binding.
Functional expression studies showed that the K526N mutation decreased
the voltage-dependence of the channel. Although 2 patients had a
phenotype consistent with typical BFNS, the other 2 patients had a
complex phenotype that was atypical and severe, consistent with an
encephalopathy (EIEE7; 613720). One developed an extremely unfavorable
outcome, profound mental retardation, and spastic quadriparesis. The
other continued to have focal seizures until late infancy with a
moderate degree of mental retardation and a mild cerebellar syndrome.
Borgatti et al. (2004) noted that some patients with BFNS may experience
seizures later in life or a different set of epileptic subtypes
sometimes associated with severe neurologic and intellectual impairment.
Overall, the clinical, genetic, and functional data did not provide a
definitive explanation for the wide range of phenotypic variability
observed in the described family, therefore preventing
genotype-phenotype correlations. The authors postulated that the
phenotypic variability could be due to the interplay of pathogenic
mutations, modifier genes, and more subtle environmental factors.

For a similar EIEE7 phenotype, see Dedek et al. (2003) and 602235.0008.

KCNQ2, SER247TRP

In a mother and son with severe epilepsy, Dedek et al. (2003) identified
a heterozygous C-to-G transversion in exon 5 of the KCNQ2 gene,
resulting in a ser247-to-trp (S247W) substitution in the fifth
transmembrane residue of the protein. The mutation was not identified in
202 control chromosomes. Both patients had an atypical course
characterized by drug-resistant seizures necessitating ACTH treatment.
In addition, the son developed epileptic encephalopathy with delayed
psychomotor development (EIEE7; 613720). Functional expression studies
showed that the S247W mutation reduced channel currents by more than 50%
in homomeric KCNQ2 channels. Dedek et al. (2003) emphasized that some
KCNQ2 mutations may be associated with a more severe phenotype than is
typical for BFNS.

KCNQ2, 10-BP DEL/1-BP INS, NT761

In 9 affected members of a large Italian family with BFNS1 (121200),
Bassi et al. (2005) identified a heterozygous 10-bp deletion and 1-bp
insertion (761del10insA) in the KCNQ2 gene, resulting in a truncated
N-terminal peptide of 194 residues. The resultant mutant protein lacks
the S4 domain, which is critical for voltage sensing. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the mutant KCNQ2 subunit was
unable to form functional homomeric potassium channels, suggesting
haploinsufficiency rather than a dominant-negative effect. One affected
family member developed severe epilepsy associated with mild mental
retardation and persistent neurologic problems in adult life (EIEE7;
613720); this phenotypic variability was considered by the authors to be
consistent with the fact that 10 to 15% of BFNS individuals experience
seizure manifestations later in life.

heterozygous 1-bp deletion (2127delT) in the last exon of the KCNQ2
gene, resulting in a replacement of the C terminus with 219 new amino
acids and a protein that is 56 residues longer than the wildtype

In a 25-year-old Egyptian man with isolated myokymia (see 121200),
Wuttke et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition in the
KCNQ2 gene, resulting in an arg207-to-gln (R207Q) substitution in a
highly conserved residue in the voltage sensor region of the potassium
channel. He had no history of neonatal seizures and no family history of
epilepsy or peripheral nerve hyperexcitability. Clinically, he had
permanent muscle overactivity in the distal upper extremities and small
amplitude movements of the fingers, which were not disabling. However,
he also reported exercise-induced cramps of both hands since childhood
and 4 episodes of exercise-induced generalized muscle stiffness. EMG
showed spontaneous irregular discharges consistent with myokymia. Wuttke
et al. (2007) noted that a mutation in the same codon (R207W;
602235.0006) had been associated with neonatal epilepsy and/or myokymia.
In vitro functional expression studies showed that mutant R207W and
R207Q channels had large depolarizing shifts and marked slowing of
activation time compared to wildtype channels. Coexpression with
wildtype channels showed a dominant-negative effect reducing the current
amplitude by 70% after short depolarization.

arg213-to-gln (R213Q) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
transmembrane domain. The mutation was not found in 276 control
individuals. The patient had onset of multiple daily seizures on the
second day of life, and the mother had noted jerking movements during
pregnancy. The patient had poor response to treatment, but the seizures
remitted at age 14 months. However, at age 2 years 10 months, she had
severe psychomotor retardation, could not roll over, was nonverbal, had
severe spastic quadriplegia, and some dysmorphic features. Her father,
who had benign neonatal seizures and myokymia, was mosaic for the
mutation, which was found in 30% of his lymphocytes.

resulting in a met546-to-val (M546V) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in one of the calmodulin binding domains in the C-terminal
region. The mutation was not found in 276 control individuals. On the
third day of life, the patient had onset of multiple daily tonic
seizures resistant to treatment and associated with a burst suppression
pattern on EEG that evolved into multifocal epileptic activity. Seizures
remitted at age 3 years and the EEG was normal at age 8. However, he had

300089	TITLE *300089 ISOCITRATE DEHYDROGENASE 3, GAMMA SUBUNIT; IDH3G
;;ISOCITRATE DEHYDROGENASE, NAD(+)-SPECIFIC, MITOCHONDRIAL, GAMMA SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION Brenner et al. (1997) presented the entire genomic sequence, as well as
the cDNA sequence, of the human gene encoding the gamma subunit of the
NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH-gamma). The gene,
symbolized IDH3G, is located in the region Xq28, approximately 70 kb
telomeric to the ABCD1 gene (300371) and adjacent to the TRAP-delta gene
(300090), which they also cloned. The sequences of the transcripts of
IDH-gamma and TRAP-delta were obtained by searching the EST database
with genomic data. Identified ESTs were completely sequenced and
assembled to cDNAs comprising the entire coding region. For IDH-gamma,
several EST clones indicated differential splicing. The 2 genes are
arranged in a compact head-to-head manner. The nontranscribed intergenic
region comprises only 133 bp and is embedded in a CpG island. Brenner et
al. (1997) concluded that the CpG island functions as a bidirectional
promoter to initiate the transcription of both functionally unrelated
genes with quite distinct expression patterns. Brenner et al. (1997)
showed that in both rat and mouse, this region of the genome is
similarly compact and comprises less than 249 bp in rat and not more
than 164 bp in mouse. In both cases this intergenic region is embedded
in a CpG island and is highly conserved, with nucleotide identity values
ranging from 70.1% between human and rat to 92.6% between mouse and rat.

In a male patient with periventricular heterotopia (300049) and a large
duplication of Xq28 reported by Fink et al. (1997), Fox et al. (1998)
found that the centromeric boundary of the duplicated segment of Xq28
was base 3377 of the 3,395 bases of intron 1 of the IDH3G gene,
approximately 600 kb distal to DXS15.

609561	TITLE *609561 CARBOXYPEPTIDASE A5; CPA5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Carboxypeptidases have functions ranging from digestion of food to
selective biosynthesis of neuroendocrine peptides. Members of the A/B
subfamily of carboxypeptidases, such as CPA5, contain an approximately
90-amino acid pro region that assists in the folding of the active
carboxypeptidase domain. Cleavage of the pro region activates the enzyme
(Wei et al., 2002).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to CPA1 (114850) and CPB1
(114852), Wei et al. (2002) identified CPA5. The deduced 436-amino acid
protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a pro domain
and a carboxypeptidase catalytic domain that includes residues involved
in zinc coordination and substrate catalysis and a single disulfide
bond. CPA5 ESTs were found in testis, adult brain, and fetal heart cDNA
libraries. One of the CPA5 sequences from testis contains an alternative
exon 2 (exon 2B) not found in the other CPA5 sequences. Northern blot
analysis of mouse tissues detected Cpa5 expression in testis, but not in
kidney, liver, brain, and lung. RT-PCR detected expression in mouse
testis and pancreas and in a mouse pituitary corticotrophic cell line,
but not in any other mouse tissues examined. In situ hybridization
revealed stage-specific expression of Cpa5 in germ cells of mouse
testis. Cpa5 was also expressed in the anterior and intermediate lobes
of the pituitary, but not in the neural lobe.

GENE FUNCTION

Modeling analysis by Wei et al. (2002) predicted that, like CPA1, CPA2
(600688), and CPA3 (114851), CPA5 cleaves substrates with C-terminal
hydrophobic residues. Wei et al. (2002) found that CPA5 cleaved a
synthetic substrate, furylacryloyl-gly-leu, following removal of its pro
domain. CPA5 activity was much greater at pH 7.4 than at pH 5.6.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wei et al. (2002) determined that the CPA5 gene contains 14 exons,
including 2 alternative second exons, exons 2A and 2B. Exons 1, 2A, and
2B of CPA5 are noncoding.

MAPPING

Wei et al. (2002) mapped the CPA5 gene to a CPA gene cluster on
chromosome 7. The order of the genes is CPA2--CPA4 (607635)--CPA5--CPA1.
Bentley et al. (2003) determined that the CPA gene cluster containing
CPA5 maps to chromosome 7q32.

PROTOONCOGENE BCD1;;
TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR ZF9; ZF9;;
CORE PROMOTER ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN; COPEB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) family and related
genes do not have TATA boxes or the initiator in their promoter regions.
To identify proteins that regulate PSG gene expression, Koritschoner et
al. (1997) screened a placenta expression library with the core promoter
element (CPE) from PSG5 (176394). They isolated cDNAs encoding a protein
that they called 'core promoter element-binding protein' (CBPB or
COPEB). By sequence analysis, Koritschoner et al. (1997) found 2
possible translation initiation codons, use of which would produce
predicted proteins of either 283 or 290 amino acids. COPEB contains an
N-terminal acidic domain, a serine/threonine-rich central region, and 3
contiguous zinc finger domains in the C-terminal region. The in vitro
COPEB translation product had a mass of 32 kD by SDS-PAGE. Using
mammalian cells expressing COPEB, Koritschoner et al. (1997) showed that
COPEB is capable of activating transcription approximately 4-fold from
the PSG5 promoter. A Gal4-COPEB fusion protein activated transcription
from a heterologous promoter containing Gal4 binding sites. Northern
blot analysis revealed that COPEB is expressed as a 4.5-kb mRNA in
several tissues, with the highest levels in placenta.

El Rouby and Newcomb (1996) identified a novel protooncogene expressed
in B cells, designated BCD1 by them. They cloned it from the peripheral
blood lymphocytes of a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient
through its capacity to transform NIH 3T3 cells. The expression of the
BCD1 gene was limited to 2 tissues, CD19+ B-cells and testis of normal
individuals. Malignant B cells from 50% of patients with B-cell chronic
lymphocytic leukemia studied showed no detectable BCD1 gene transcripts;
however, when malignant B cells were stimulated to undergo terminal
differentiation into plasma cells, BCD1 gene expression was induced,
suggesting an association with B-cell maturation. Since the BCD1
sequence was isolated from a leukemia patient, Patrito and Bocco (1998)
suggested that the sequence differences between COPEB and BCD1 arose as
a consequence of tumor development. The differences may be due to a
rearrangement between COPEB and another ubiquitously expressed protein,
resulting in a fusion protein, or to multiple mutations in COPEB.

Wound repair in parenchymal tissues requires coordinate changes in
resident mesenchymal cells that ultimately lead to fibrosis. In the
liver, this response involves hepatic stellate cells, which are a
nonparenchymal cell type located in the subendothelial space of the
sinusoid. Stellate cells express the myogenic intermediate filament
desmin, and, in normal liver, are the primary storage site for
retinoids, which are found in cytoplasmic droplets in retinyl esters.
Analogous cells in other organs include mesangial cells in kidney and
pulmonary fibroblasts in lung. The response of stellate cells to injury
is termed 'activation' and represents a cellular program with a distinct
temporal sequence involving both up- and downregulation of gene
expression. The methods for isolating and culturing stellate cells are
useful for exploring molecular mechanisms of stellate cell activation.
To broaden the search for transcription factors involved in the
activation process, subtraction hybridization was used to identify
transcripts induced early in rat stellate cells in vivo after a single
dose of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), a known precipitant of hepatic
fibrosis. In this way cDNA showing homology to zinc finger proteins was
isolated. Ratziu et al. (1998) isolated full-length rat and human cDNAs,
which they termed ZF9, and characterized production of ZF9 protein. They
established that ZF9 is a nuclear DNA-binding protein in activated cells
that, in a context-dependent manner, transactivates a key promoter
driving stellate cell fibrogenesis. The ZF9 nucleotide sequence predicts
that it is a member of the Kruppel-like family with a unique N-terminal
domain rich in serine-proline clusters and leucines. ZF9 binds
specifically to a DNA oligonucleotide containing a GC-box motif. Ratziu
et al. (1998) noted that COPEB/BCD1 is the human homolog of Zf9.

MAPPING

El Rouby et al. (1997) determined the chromosomal assignment of BCD1 by
Southern blot analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids that contain
a single chromosome or several different human chromosomes in one or
more hybrid cell lines. The assignment to chromosome 10 was confirmed
and refined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which
localized the gene to 10p15-p14. By FISH, Onyango et al. (1998) further
refined the map position to 10p15. By the same method, Ratziu et al.
(1998) assigned the ZF9 gene to 10p.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Narla et al. (2001) demonstrated that KLF6 is mutated in a subset of
human prostate cancer. Loss of heterozygosity analysis revealed that 1
KLF6 allele is deleted in 77% (17 of 22) of primary prostate tumors.
Sequence analysis of the retained KLF6 allele revealed mutations in 71%
of these tumors. Functional studies confirmed that whereas wildtype KLF6
upregulates p21 (WAF1/CIP1; 116899) in a p53-independent manner and
significantly reduces cell proliferation, tumor-derived KLF6 mutants do
not. Furthermore, Narla et al. (2001) demonstrated that separate
malignant foci within prostate cancers from the same patient contained
different KLF6 mutations. Narla et al. (2001) observed that 18 of 33
prostate tumors had KLF6 mutations. Of the 26 mutations identified, 23
were within the KLF6 transactivation domain. These mutations resulted in
25 nonconservative amino acid changes and the introduction of a
premature stop codon. None of these mutations was present in the
patient's normal prostate tissue DNA or in germline DNA from 100
chromosomes of 50 unaffected, unrelated individuals. The majority of the
mutations affected highly conserved amino acids, suggesting that these
residues are functionally important.

In a set of 80 sporadic gastric cancers, Cho et al. (2005) identified 4
missense mutations in exon 2 of the KLF6 gene (see, e.g., 602053.0006);
the mutations were absent from corresponding normal tissue, suggesting
somatic mutation. In addition, 16 (43.2%) of 37 informative cases showed
allelic loss at the KLF6 locus. All of the cases with mutation and 13 of
the 16 with allelic loss were of advanced intestinal-type gastric cancer
with lymph node metastasis.

DESCRIPTION The serotonin 1D receptor was initially characterized by radioligand
binding procedures using membranes derived from bovine caudate nucleus.
The 5-HT-1D receptor is known to be a G protein-coupled receptor.
Sumatriptan, an agent effective in the treatment of acute migraine, is
the only ligand yet identified that is selective for the 5-HT-1D
receptor. Weinshank et al. (1992) reported the cloning, deduced amino
acid sequences, pharmacologic properties, and second-messenger coupling
of a pair of human 5-HT-1D receptor genes, which they designated alpha
and beta due to their strong similarities. Both genes have no introns in
their coding regions, are expressed in the human cerebral cortex, and
can couple to inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. Their
pharmacologic binding properties match closely those of human, bovine,
and guinea pig 5-HT-1D sites. Libert et al. (1991) obtained cDNA clones
encoding 4 receptors of the G protein-coupled receptor family by
selective amplification and cloning from thyroid cDNA. One of these
clones, termed RDC4 by them, showed close structural similarity with the
serotonin 5HT1A receptor (109760). By in situ hybridization, they
demonstrated that the gene (HTR1D) is located on chromosome 1 at
1p36.3-p34.3. By Southern blot analysis of a hybrid cell panel, Jin et
al. (1992) showed that the HTR1D gene is located on chromosome 1. Wilkie
et al. (1993) showed that the homologous gene in the mouse is located on
chromosome 4.

610257	TITLE *610257 SEC31, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, A; SEC31A
;;SEC31-LIKE 1; SEC31L1;;
KIAA0905
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SEC31A is a subunit of coat protein complex II (COPII)-coated vesicles,
which are essential for secretion (Jin et al., 2012).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned SEC31L1, which they designated
KIAA0905. The deduced protein contains 1,220 amino acids. RT-PCR
detected moderate expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific
brain regions examined.

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to yeast Sec31,
followed by screening a pancreas cDNA library, Tang et al. (2000) cloned
SEC31L1, which they called SEC31A. The deduced 1,218-amino acid protein
shares 25.8% identity with yeast Sec31. It contains 5 WD40 or WD40-like
repeats at its N terminus and a proline-rich region in its C-terminal
half. Northern blot analysis detected a 4-kb transcript that was
abundantly and ubiquitously expressed. In rat kidney cells, Sec31a
colocalized with Sec13 (SEC13L1; 600152) in vesicular-tubular structures
characteristic of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunostaining for Sec31a in intact and permeabilized rat kidney
cells, Tang et al. (2000) found that Sec31a was not tightly associated
with the membrane. Binding of Sec31a to specific membrane structures was
restored by incubating washed cells with cytosol, indicating that Sec31a
was recruited to membranes. The membrane association of Sec31a was
greatly enhanced in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog. Tang
et al. (2000) demonstrated that Sec31A and Sec13 coimmunoprecipitated
and that the proteins existed in a 600- to 700-kD complex.
Immunodepletion studies showed that rat Sec31a was required for
ER-to-Golgi vesicular transport.

Jin et al. (2012) found that monoubiquitination of Sec31 in mouse
embryonic stem cells by Klhl12 (614522) and the Cul3 (603136) E3
ubiquitin ligase complex was required for COPII vesicle expansion to
accommodate large cargo proteins, such as procollagens (see 120150). A
Sec31-binding mutant of Klhl12 neither colocalized with Sec31 at
intracellular vesicles nor induced formation of large vesicles.
Disruption of KLHL12-CUL3 function in human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells
impaired COPII vesicle expansion and collagen export, but it had no
effect on export of smaller cargo by small COPII vesicles. Jin et al.
(2012) concluded that KLHL12-CUL3 monoubiquitination of SEC31 is
required for COPII vesicle expansion to accommodate large or bulky cargo
molecules.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the SEC31L1
gene to chromosome 4.

611973	TITLE *611973 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S6; MRPS6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPS6 is 1 of more
than 70 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes that are encoded
by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human MRPS6. The deduced 125-amino acid MRPS6 protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 14.2 kD. Koc et al. (2001) identified MRPS6
orthologs in mouse, Drosophila, C. elegans, yeast, and E. coli. Highest
conservation is in the N-terminal end and central region of MRPS6
orthologs. Mouse and human MRPS6 share 84.8% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS map,
Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRPS6 gene to chromosome
21q21.3-q22.1.

606599	TITLE *606599 THIOREDOXIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN; TXNIP
;;VITAMIN D3-UPREGULATED PROTEIN 1; VDUP1;;
THIOREDOXIN-BINDING PROTEIN 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Exposure to vitamin D3 (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) or phorbol ester
induces the bipotent HL-60 cell promyelocytic leukemia cell line to
differentiate into monocytes/macrophages, whereas retinoic acid and
dimethylsulfoxide induce differentiation towards granulocytes. The
differentiation is accompanied by regulation of MYC (190080), FOS
(164810), FMS (CSF1R; 164770), and myeloblastin (PRTN3; 177020). By
differential screening of HL60 cell lines, Chen and DeLuca (1994)
identified a cDNA encoding TXNIP, which they termed VDUP1. The deduced
TXNIP protein has 391 amino acids. Ribonuclease protection analysis
showed dramatically increased expression of TXNIP in response to vitamin
D3 but not to phorbol ester. Chen and DeLuca (1994) concluded that TXNIP
is not involved in the differentiation process.

Junn et al. (2000) cloned mouse Vdup1. The deduced 395-amino acid
protein shares 94% identity with human VDUP1. Northern blot analysis
detected expression of Vdup1 in all tissues examined. Expression was
relatively low in brain and liver. Transient transfected HeLa cells
expressed Vdup1 in the cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Junn et al. (2000) found that the C-terminal half of mouse Vdup1
interacted with the redox-active center of thioredoxin (TRX, or TXN;
187700). Mutation of 2 critical cysteines in the Trx active center
abrogated the interaction with Vdup1. Transfection of mouse Vdup1 into
human embryonic kidney cells reduced the endogenous reducing activity of
TRX or the activity of cotransfected TRX. Overexpression of Vdup1
inhibited interaction between Trx and a thiol-specific antioxidant, Pag
(PRDX1; 176763), and it inhibited interaction between Trx and Ask1.
Treatment of mouse fibroblasts and T-cell hybridoma cells with various
stress stimuli, such as hydrogen peroxide or heat shock, induced Vdup1
expression. Exposure of mouse fibroblasts overexpressing Vdup1 to stress
resulted in reduced cell proliferation and elevated apoptotic cell
death. Junn et al. (2000) concluded that VDUP1 functions as an oxidative
stress mediator by inhibiting TRX activity.

Wang et al. (2002) found that biomechanical strain or hydrogen peroxide
downregulated expression of Vdup1, but not Trx, in rat cardiomyocytes.
The rapid response occurred through transcriptional control and led to
increased Trx activity. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Vdup1
suppressed Trx activity and induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis.
Furthermore, Vdup1 overexpression sensitized cells to hydrogen
peroxide-induced apoptosis, whereas Trx overexpression protected cells
against injury. Wang et al. (2002) concluded that VDUP1 is a key
stress-responsive inhibitor of thioredoxin activity in cardiomyocytes.

Yoshioka et al. (2004) overexpressed TXN in rat cardiomyocytes and
observed the induction of protein synthesis; overexpression of TXNIP
reduced protein synthesis in response to mechanical strain,
phenylephrine, and angiotensin II (see 106150). In vivo, myocardial TXN
activity increased 3.5-fold compared to sham controls after transverse
aortic constriction; however, aortic constriction did not increase TXN
expression but reduced TXNIP expression by 40%. Gene transfer studies
revealed that cells overexpressing TXNIP developed less hypertrophy
after aortic constriction than control cells in the same animals.
Yoshioka et al. (2004) concluded that TXN has a dual function as both an
antioxidant and a signaling protein involved in the development of
pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy, and suggested that TXNIP is a
critical regulator of biomechanical signaling.

Tissing et al. (2007) found that 8 hours of prednisolone treatment
altered expression of 51 genes in leukemic cells from children with
precursor-B- or T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared with nonexposed
cells. The 3 most highly upregulated genes were FKBP5 (602623), ZBTB16
(176797), and TXNIP, which were upregulated 35.4-, 8.8-, and 3.7-fold,
respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ludwig et al. (2001) determined that the mouse Txnip gene contains 8
exons and spans 2.3 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TXNIP
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP WI-8000).

Using FISH, Ludwig et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Txnip gene to
chromosome 3 in a region showing homology of synteny to human chromosome
1q21.

ANIMAL MODEL

Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL; 144250) is a common,
multifactorial and heterogeneous dyslipidemia predisposing to premature
coronary artery disease and characterized by elevated plasma
triglycerides, cholesterol, or both. Castellani et al. (1998) identified
a mouse mutant strain, HcB-19, that shares features with FCHL, including
hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, elevated plasma
apolipoprotein B, and increased secretion of triglyceride-rich
lipoproteins. This disorder was shown to result from spontaneous
mutation at a locus, designated Hyplip1 (602491), on distal mouse
chromosome 3 in a region syntenic to 1q21-q23, where a locus for FCHL
was identified in Finnish, German, Chinese, and U.S. families. By
positional cloning, Bodnar et al. (2002) demonstrated that the mouse
Hyplip1 gene is Txnip, and they demonstrated a Txnip nonsense mutation
in the HcB-19 strain that was absent in its normolipidemic parental
strains. The causative mutation was found to be a T-to-A transversion at
position 337 in the 1,456-bp cDNA. This spontaneous mutation changed a
tyrosine (TAT) to a stop codon (TAA) at amino acid 97; the protein
normally consists of 395 amino acid residues. Txnip encodes a
cytoplasmic protein that binds and inhibits thioredoxin, a major
regulator of cellular redox state. The mutant mice had decreased CO(2)
production but increased ketone body synthesis, suggesting that altered
redox status downregulates the citric acid cycle, sparing fatty acids
for triglyceride and ketone body production. Castellani et al. (1998)
suggested further studies to elucidate the potential role of the human
homolog in FCHL and other metabolic disorders. Although hyperlipidemia
in mice is associated with mutation in the Txnip gene, the human
disorder is associated with the USF1 gene (191523).

Sheth et al. (2005) created Txnip-deficient mice on a variety of genetic
backgrounds. Homozygous mutant mice were similar in weight and activity
to wildtype or heterozygous littermates, and there were no differences
in food consumption. However, Txnip-deficient mice in the fed state
exhibited a metabolic profile similar to fasted mice, with increased
plasma ketone bodies and free fatty acids, decreased glucose, and
increased expression of metabolic enzymes in liver and other tissues.
Txnip-deficient mice also showed an altered redox status, with a
significantly increased ratio of NADH to NAD+. The fat-to-muscle ratio
of Txnip-deficient mice was increased by about 40%, primarily due to
decreased muscle mass. Txnip deficiency did not result in significantly
increased liver thioredoxin activity in either the fasted or fed states.
Some Txnip-deficient mice developed liver adenomas and carcinomas at
about 9 months of age.

By comparing Txnip-null mice with mice lacking Txnip specifically in
muscle or liver, Hui et al. (2008) determined that deficiency of Txnip
in skeletal muscle and heart is responsible for the inability of
Txnip-null mice to modify fuel metabolism in response to fasting. They
found that Txnip deficiency in skeletal muscle and heart impaired the
ability of thioredoxin NADPH-dependent disulfide reduction to maintain
Pten (601728) in a sufficiently active state to oppose Akt (see AKT1;
164730) signaling. Unopposed, Akt activation in Txnip-deficient skeletal
muscle and heart prevented switching of fuel away from glucose toward
3-hydroxybutyrate and fatty acids, resulting in an inappropriate
metabolic adaptation to food deprivation.

Lee et al. (2005) generated healthy and viable mice lacking Vdup1. Flow
cytometric and functional assays revealed only slight alterations in B-
and T-cell populations, but there was a severe defect in NK-cell
function and development. NK cells from Vdup1 -/- mice showed reduced
Cd122 (IL2RB; 146710) expression and reduced responsiveness to Il15
(600554) in the absence of vitamin D3, suggesting that CD122 expression
is dependent on VDUP1. Vdup1 -/- mice were less able to reject NK
cell-sensitive tumor cells compared with wildtype mice. Lee et al.
(2005) concluded that VDUP1 is necessary for NK-cell growth and
cytotoxic function, and that it is also involved in regulation of
intestinal intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Pall et al. (2004) cloned mouse Mospd3 and identified the human MOSPD3
gene. The deduced 235-amino acid MOSPD3 protein contains an N-terminal
major sperm protein domain and 2 transmembrane domains.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Pall et al. (2004) mapped the MOSPD3 gene
to chromosome 7q22. They mapped the mouse Mospd3 gene to a region of
chromosome 5 that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 7q22.

ANIMAL MODEL

phenotypic defect was dependent on the genetic background, indicating
the presence of modifier loci.

HIV-1 INDUCER OF SHORT TRANSCRIPTS-BINDING FACTOR 1;;
HIV-1 IST-BINDING FACTOR 1; FBI1;;
LEUKEMIA/LYMPHOMA-RELATED FACTOR; LRF;;
POKEMON
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

BTB/POZ domains can form homomeric or heterodimeric complexes and are
found in some viral and cellular proteins that may not be associated
with transcription. By screening mouse embryo cDNA libraries using
RT-PCR with degenerate primers to detect cDNAs encoding BTB/POZ
domain-containing proteins, followed by screening a mouse heart cDNA
library and a human genomic library, Davies et al. (1999) obtained cDNAs
encoding mouse and human LRF (leukemia/lymphoma-related factor). The
mouse and human LRF proteins share 88% amino acid identity. Northern
blot analysis revealed wide expression of 3 transcripts in various cell
lines as well as in skin, lung, and liver, but not in spleen or thymus.
Whole mount in situ hybridization analysis showed expression of Lrf in
the first 2 pharyngeal arches, limb buds, tail buds, and the neural tube
of mouse embryos, suggesting a role in stimulating cell proliferation.

By biochemical purification, micropeptide sequence analysis, EST
database searching, and screening a human embryonic carcinoma cDNA
library, Morrison et al. (1999) independently isolated a cDNA encoding
LRF, which they called FBI1 for 'factor that binds to IST,' the HIV-1
inducer of short transcripts. Sequence analysis predicted that the
584-amino acid protein contains 4 C-terminal Kruppel-type zinc fingers,
a bipartite nuclear localization signal, and an N-terminal POZ domain.
Northern blot analysis detected expression in peripheral blood
leukocytes, colon, small intestine, and ovary. SDS-PAGE and Western blot
analysis showed that FBI1 is expressed as an 86-kD protein, which is
significantly higher than its calculated molecular mass of 61.5 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

PLZF (176797) and BCL6 (109565) are BTB/POZ domain-containing zinc
finger proteins implicated in oncogenesis as well as in myelopoiesis and
lymphopoiesis, respectively. By coimmunoprecipitation and yeast 2-hybrid
analyses, Davies et al. (1999) found that LRF interacted with BCL6 but
not with PLZF. The interaction required both the BTB/POZ and zinc finger
domains of the 2 proteins. Confocal microscopy demonstrated
colocalization of LRF and BCL6 in the nucleus.

By EMSA and supershift analysis, Morrison et al. (1999) determined that
the first 2 zinc fingers of FBI1 associated with the HIV-1 IST element
and with wildtype Tat. In addition, they found that FBI1 self-associated
through its POZ domain in vitro and in vivo and through its zinc finger
domains in vivo only.

Maeda et al. (2005) identified the transcriptional repressor FBI1, which
they called Pokemon (POK erythroid myeloid ontogenic factor), as a
critical factor in oncogenesis. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking
Zbtb7 were completely refractory to oncogene-mediated cellular
transformation. Conversely, FBI1 overexpression led to overt oncogenic
transformation both in vitro and in vivo in transgenic mice. FBI1 can
specifically repress the transcription of the tumor suppressor gene ARF
(600160) through direct binding. Maeda et al. (2005) found that FBI1 is
aberrantly overexpressed in human cancers, and its expression levels
predict biologic behavior and clinical outcome.

MAPPING

Davies et al. (1999) mapped the LRF gene to 19p13.3 by FISH.

ANIMAL MODEL

Maeda et al. (2007) found that Lrf -/- mice exhibited embryonic
lethality at 16.5 days postcoitum due to severe anemia, which was
preceded by reduced numbers of fetal liver B lymphocytes after the pro-B
stage of differentiation. In contrast, T-cell levels in mice with a
conditionally deleted Lrf gene were comparable to those in control mice,
but polyclonal extrathymic Cd4/Cd8 double-positive cells accumulated in
the marrow. Treatment of Lrf conditional knockout mice with a
gamma-secretase inhibitor, which also inhibits Notch (see 190198)
signaling, rescued abnormal B- and T-cell commitment and led to
resumption of Vpreb1 (605141) expression. Maeda et al. (2007) concluded
that LRF acts as a master regulator in determination of B versus T
lymphoid fate by negatively regulating T-lineage commitment by opposing
NOTCH function. Thus, loss of LRF results in aberrant activation of the
NOTCH pathway, with upregulation of NOTCH target genes in hemopoietic
stem cells and common lymphoid progenitors.

611574	TITLE *611574 SPHINGOMYELIN SYNTHASE 2; SGMS2
;;SMS2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sphingomyelin (SM) is a major component of plasma membranes. It is
preferentially concentrated in the outer leaflet and has a role in the
formation of lipid rafts. SM synthases (EC 2.7.8.27), such as SGMS2,
produce SM in the lumen of the Golgi and on the cell surface through the
transfer of phosphocholine from phosphatidylcholine onto ceramide,
yielding diacylglycerol as a side product (Huitema et al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences encoding motifs characteristic of
SM synthases, Huitema et al. (2004) identified SGMS2, which they called
SMS2. The deduced 366-amino acid protein contains 5 membrane-spanning
alpha helices connected by hydrophilic extramembrane loops as well as 4
highly conserved motifs, designated D1 to D4. Protease protection
analysis of transfected HeLa cells revealed that the C terminus was
cytosolic, indicating that the putative active site residues are in the
extracellular space. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected a
1.9-kb transcript in brain, heart, kidney, liver, muscle, and stomach.
SGMS2 localized primarily to the plasma membrane as well as to the Golgi
apparatus.

GENE FUNCTION

By heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae, Huitema et al. (2004)
showed that human SGMS2 formed SM in the presence of choline and
ceramide. Both phosphatidylcholine and SM itself were utilized as
phosphorylcholine group donors, but lysophosphatidylcholine was a very
poor substrate, and other donors, including other phospholipids, did not
support SM formation. Huitema et al. (2004) concluded that SGMS2
requires 2 fatty chains on the phosphocholine donor molecule for it to
be utilized as a substrate. SGMS2 could also catalyze the reverse
reaction.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SGMS2
gene to chromosome 4 (TMAP STS-H01973).

607170	TITLE *607170 CYSTEINE-RICH PROTEIN WITH EGF-LIKE DOMAINS 1; CRELD1
;;CIRRIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530)-like repeats are a class of
cysteine-rich domains that mediate interactions between proteins of
diverse function. EGF domains are found in proteins that are either
completely secreted or have transmembrane regions that tether the
protein to the cell surface. CRELD1 is the founding member of a family
of matricellular proteins.

CLONING

By screening EST clones mapped to chromosome 3p25-p24.2, Rupp et al.
(2002) identified CRELD1, which shows sequence similarity to
extracellular matrix proteins. The full-length clone encodes a deduced
420-amino acid protein. Structural analysis suggested that CRELD1 is a
cell adhesion molecule that contains an N-terminal signal sequence; 2
type III transmembrane domains separated by a short cytoplasmic loop; a
tandem array of EGF-like repeats; and a region rich in glutamate and
tryptophan residues (WE domain). It also has 2 putative N-linked
glycosylation sites and several possible serine, threonine, and tyrosine
phosphorylation sites. Utilization of an alternative exon 9 (exon 9b
within intron 9) results in a protein with a unique C terminus that has
no predicted transmembrane domain. Rupp et al. (2002) also cloned the
cow and mouse orthologs of CRELD1, which share 94% and 92% amino acid
identity with human CRELD1, respectively. Database analysis revealed
that the CRELD1 gene is highly conserved across species, including
Drosophila and C. elegans.

Using Northern blot analysis, Rupp et al. (2002) detected ubiquitous
expression of a major 2.1-kb CRELD1 transcript, with highest expression
in fetal lung, liver, and kidney, and in adult heart, brain, and
skeletal muscle. Adult brain also showed an alternative transcript of
2.5 kb, and several heart regions showed an additional transcript of 2.3
kb. By Northern array analysis, Rupp et al. (2002) determined that the
variant that utilizes exon 9b is expressed in adult brain, thymus, lymph
node, and several areas of the gastrointestinal tract, and in fetal
spleen, thymus, and lung. In situ hybridization in developing chick
embryos revealed expression of Creld1 at all time points and localized
high levels of expression in the developing heart, limb buds, mandible,
branchial arches, and brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rupp et al. (2002) determined that the CRELD1 gene contains 11 exons
spanning approximately 12 kb. The major 2.1-kb transcript utilizes exons
1 through 10. There are repetitive elements (SINE and LINE class) in
introns 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9 and a simple hexanucleotide repeat in intron
6.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of a BAC contig, Rupp et al.
(2002) mapped the CRELD1 gene to chromosome 3p25.3. Radiation hybrid
analysis localized the mouse Creld1 gene to distal chromosome 6, which
shows homology of synteny with human chromosome 3p25.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Rupp et al. (2002) noted that the CRELD1 gene is in a region of loss of
heterozygosity for several types of cancer.

In a patient with an isolated atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD2;
606217), Robinson et al. (2003) identified an arg329-to-cys mutation
(R329C; 607170.0001) in the CRELD1 gene, which was present but not
expressed in the proband's father, brother, or sister. These findings
were consistent with previous observations of incomplete penetrance in
AVSD (Pierpont et al., 2000). Given the low penetrance observed in this
family, Robinson et al. (2003) proposed that CRELD1 is an AVSD
susceptibility gene and that CRELD1 mutations increase the risk of
developing a heart defect, rather than being directly causative. In 2
other patients, Robinson et al. (2003) identified thr311-to-ile (T311I;
607170.0002) and arg107-to-his (R107H; 607170.0003) mutations,
respectively.

Among 49 patients with AVSD, Zatyka et al. (2005) identified 5 novel
sequence variants in the CRELD1 gene. Three of the novel variants were
also identified in normal controls, 1 was a silent change, and 1 was
also seen in 2 family members without congenital heart disease
(607170.0004). Genetic analysis of 12 patients with 3p- syndrome
(613792) showed that the CRELD1 gene was deleted in all 5 patients with
an AVSD but was also deleted in 4 patients without congenital heart
disease. Zatyka et al. (2005) concluded that CRELD1 deletions are
unlikely to account for AVSD in children with 3p deletions but that rare
missense mutations may confer susceptibility to AVSD in a subset of
patients.

Because trisomy 21 (190685) is by far the most common finding associated
with AVSD, Maslen et al. (2006) analyzed the CRELD1 gene in 39
individuals with Down syndrome and complete AVSD. They identified
heterozygosity for missense mutations in 2 infants (607170.0001 and
607170.0005, respectively), and suggested that defects in CRELD1 may
contribute to the pathogenesis of AVSD in the context of trisomy 21.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CRELD1, ARG329CYS

In an individual with an isolated partial atrioventricular septal defect
(606217), Robinson et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous 4201C-T
transition in exon 9 of the CRELD1 gene, resulting in an arg329-to-cys
(R329C) substitution in the second cb-EGF domain. The addition of a free
cysteine residue to a cb-EGF domain disrupted its disulfide bonding
pattern. The mutation was inherited from the father who, like a brother
and sister of the proband who also carried the mutation, did not report
having a heart defect. Special studies likewise showed structurally
normal hearts. These findings were consistent with previous observations
of incomplete penetrance in AVSD (Pierpont et al., 2000).

In an infant with Down syndrome (190685) and complete atrioventricular
septal defect, Maslen et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for the
R329C mutation. The infant also had patent ductus arteriosus, tricuspid
regurgitation, anomalous hepatic drainage to the right atrium, and
pulmonary hypertension. The mutation was inherited from the mother, a
normal euploid individual with no evidence of a heart defect. The
mutation was not found in 30 individuals with Down syndrome and no heart
defect by echocardiography.

Ackerman et al. (2012) identified this mutation in 2 individuals with
Down syndrome and atrioventricular septal defect. The mutation was not
seen in 141 controls who had Down syndrome but no AVSD.

In an individual with an isolated partial atrioventricular septal defect
(606217), Robinson et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous 4148C-T
transition in exon 9 of the CRELD1 gene, resulting in a thr311-to-ile
(T311I) mutation in the second cb-EGF domain.

.0003
ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT, PARTIAL, WITH HETEROTAXY SYNDROME

In a patient of mixed Hispanic and African American descent with partial
atrioventricular septal defect and features of heterotaxy syndrome
(dextrocardia, right ventricle aorta with pulmonary atresia, and right
aortic arch) (see 606217), Robinson et al. (2003) identified a
heterozygous 1566G-A transition in exon 3 of the CRELD1 gene, resulting
in an arg107-to-his (R107H) mutation in the highly conserved WE domain
of the gene. No extracardiac abnormalities were detected.

.0004
ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CRELD1, PRO162ALA

In a patient with sporadic partial atrioventricular septal defect
(600309) and a 47,XXX karyotype, Zatyka et al. (2005) identified a
484C-G transversion in exon 5 of the CRELD1 gene, resulting in a
pro162-to-ala (P162A) substitution. The mutation was not identified in
200 control chromosomes but was found in the patient's mother and
maternal grandmother, neither of whom had congenital heart disease.
Zatyka et al. (2005) suggested that the P162A mutation, if causative,
showed reduced penetrance.

.0005
ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CRELD1, GLU414LYS

In an infant with Down syndrome (190685) and complete balanced
atrioventricular septal defect and tricuspid regurgitation, Maslen et
al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a 1240G-A transition in exon 10
of the CRELD1 gene, resulting in a glu414-to-lys (E414K) substitution.
The mutation was not found in either parent, in 400 race-relevant
chromosomes, or in 30 individuals with Down syndrome and no heart defect
by echocardiography.

Ackerman et al. (2012) identified this mutation in 1 patient with Down
syndrome and AVSD; it was not identified in 141 individuals with Down
syndrome and no congenital heart defect.

602479	TITLE *602479 POU DOMAIN, CLASS 3, TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 1; POU3F1
;;OCT6;;
SCIP
DESCRIPTION The vertebrate class III POU transcription factors consist of 4 members:
POU3F1 (Oct6), POU3F2 (600494), POU3F3 (Brain-1), and POU3F4 (Brain-4;
300039). The chromosomal locations of the murine class III POU genes
were determined by interspecific backcross analysis (Avraham et al.,
1993; Xia et al., 1993). On the basis of mouse-human chromosomal
homologies, human POU3F1 and POU3F3 were expected to map to 1p and 2q,
respectively. Sumiyama et al. (1998) found that the location of POU3F1
was consistent with this position, mapping to 1p34.1 by FISH. Contrary
to the prediction, however, POU3F3 was mapped to 3p14.2 by the same
method. The human POU3F2 and POU3F4 genes map to 6q16 and Xq21.1,
respectively. Thus, the 4 human class III POU genes map to different
chromosomes. A phylogenetic tree of these 4 genes shows that they
emerged in a common ancestor of vertebrates. Studies of the genome
structure of vertebrates suggest that genome duplication occurred at
least twice in the early stage of vertebrate evolution; 4 homologous
complexes such as Hox and MHC are interspersed in the mammalian genome.
The findings with the 4 class III POU genes are consistent with the idea
of 2 genome duplications.

Xia et al. (1993) mapped the mouse homolog of the POU3F1 gene, called
Tst1 by them, to chromosome 4.

Most mice homozygous for a mutant Pou3f1 die soon after birth
(Bermingham et al., 1996; Jaegle et al., 1996). Bermingham et al. (1996)
and Jaegle et al. (1996) showed that sciatic nerves of Oct6 -/- mice
showed a delay in Schwann cell differentiation, with a transient arrest
at the promyelination stage before axonal wrapping, suggesting that Oct6
is required for the transition of promyelin cells to myelinating cells.
Arroyo et al. (1998) confirmed these findings and used
beta-galactosidase expression to show that promyelinating Schwann cells
expressed the highest levels of Oct6, both in developing and
regenerating nerves.

In rat sciatic nerves, Nickols et al. (2003) found that expression of
the activated p65 subunit (164014) of the transcription factor NFKB was
high in the nuclei of premyelinating Schwann cells and then
progressively declined until it was nearly absent in adults. NFKB
expression preceded and was necessary for the upregulation of Oct6. The
authors concluded that NFKB is upstream of Oct6 induction and is also
required for the formation of peripheral myelin.

Ghazvini et al. (2002) created mice with a Schwann cell-specific
deficiency in Oct6 expression. Mice homozygous for this deficiency were
viable but showed a delay in peripheral nerve development. In the
absence of Oct6, Krox20 (129010) expression was delayed but was
eventually activated at the time of extensive myelination. Sciatic nerve
regeneration following crush lesion was also delayed in the absence of
Oct6 gene function.

The transient nature of the Schwann cell defect in Oct6-deficient mice
observed by Ghazvini et al. (2002) suggested some redundancy in
transcription factor function during Schwann cell development. In
sciatic nerve extracts from chick embryos, young chicks, and mice,
Jaegle et al. (2003) showed that the POU transcription factor Brn2
(POU3F2; 600494) is expressed and regulated in developing Schwann cells
in a manner similar to that of Oct6, and that Brn2 gene activation does
not depend on Oct6. Overexpression of Brn2 in Oct6-deficient Schwann
cells of mice showed partial rescue of peripheral nerve developmental
delay with an increase in the number of actively myelinating Schwann
cells, suggesting that Brn2 can functionally substitute for Oct6 in
promoting the transition from promyelinating to myelinating Schwann
cells. Compound disruption of both Oct6 and Brn2 resulted in a much more
severe phenotype with abnormal nerve morphology. Jaegle et al. (2003)
concluded that Brn2 and Oct6 share roles as positive regulators of
Schwann cell development.

612220	TITLE *612220 BETA-1,4-N-ACETYLGALACTOSAMINYLTRANSFERASE 3; B4GALNT3
;;B4GalNAcT3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

B4GALNT3 transfers N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) onto glucosyl residues
to form N,N-prime-diacetyllactosediamine (LacdiNAc, or LDN), a unique
terminal structure of cell surface N-glycans (Ikehara et al., 2006).

CLONING

By searching a human database for sequences encoding
beta-1,4-glycosyltransferase (beta-4GT) motifs, followed by 5-prime RACE
and PCR of a human stomach cDNA library, Sato et al. (2003) cloned
B4GALNT3, which they designated B4GalNAcT3. The deduced 999-amino acid
protein has a typical type II topology, with an N-terminal transmembrane
domain, 4 potential N-glycosylation sites, a DXH sequence thought to
participate in divalent cation binding, and a C-terminal WGGED motif
characteristic of beta-4GTs. Sato et al. (2003) also identified mouse
B4galnt3, which encodes a deduced 986-amino acid protein that shares
82.2% identity with human B4GALNT3. RT-PCR of human tissues detected
high B4GALNT3 expression in stomach, colon, and testis, and lower
expression in other tissues. B4GALNT3 was also expressed in colon and
stomach cancer cell lines and some other cell lines.

Using Western blot analysis with reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE,
Ikehara et al. (2006) found that recombinant soluble B4GalNAcT3, lacking
the N-terminal transmembrane domain, was processed into N- and
C-terminal fragments that were coupled through disulfide bonds.
Immunohistochemical analysis of human gastric tissues showed that
B4GalNAcT3 was expressed only in surface mucous cells of pyloric and
fundic glands and in the glandular compartment of fundic glands.
Confocal microscopy showed that B4GalNAcT3 localized specifically to the
trans-Golgi region.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a variety of UDP donors and monosaccharide acceptors, Sato et al.
(2003) found that a soluble form of B4GalNAcT3 expressed in human
embryonic kidney cells transferred GalNAc to N-acetylglucosyl (GlcNAc)
beta-benzyl through a beta-1,4-linkage to form LDN. B4GalNAcT3
transferred GalNAc to all N- and O-glycans examined that contained
GlcNAc at their nonreducing termini. Some glycohormones contain
N,N-prime-LDN structures in their N-glycans. Sato et al. (2003) showed
that B4GalNAcT3 could synthesize this structure using modified fetal
calf fetuin as a model protein substrate.

Using fluorescence-labeled plant lectin Wisteria floribunda agglutinin
(WFA), which binds to terminal GalNAc residues of N-glycans, and an
anti-B4GalNAcT3 monoclonal antibody, Ikehara et al. (2006) showed that
LDN and B4GalNAcT3 localized to the same human gastric mucous cells,
with LDN appearing on the cell surface and B4GalNAcT3 in the apical side
of the nucleus in association with the trans-Golgi network.

Using real-time RT-PCR, Huang et al. (2007) found that expression of
B4GalNAcT3 was upregulated in 29 (72.5%) of 40 primary colon tumors
compared with normal colon tissue. B4GalNAcT3 overexpression in a human
colon cancer cell line enhanced cell-extracellular matrix adhesion,
migration, anchorage-independent growth, and invasion. B4GalNAcT3
overexpression increased tumor growth and metastasis and decreased
survival of tumor-bearing nude mice. The increase in malignant
phenotypes was associated with activation of focal adhesion kinase
(PTK2; 600758) and ERK/MAPK signaling. Huang et al. (2007) concluded
that upregulation of B4GalNAcT3 may contribute to the malignant behavior
of colon cancer cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sato et al. (2003) determined that the B4GALNT3 gene contains at least
20 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sato et al. (2003) mapped the B4GALNT3
gene to chromosome 12p13.3.

610400	TITLE *610400 MACRO DOMAIN-CONTAINING 1; MACROD1
;;LRP16 PROTEIN; LRP16
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By restriction landmark genomic analysis of human lymphocytes, followed
by PCR and RACE, Han et al. (2001) cloned MACROD1, which they called
LRP16. Zhao et al. (2005) noted that LRP16 encodes a 325-amino acid
protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhao et al. (2005) reported that ectopic expression of LRP16 stimulated
proliferation of MCF7 breast cancer cells. LRP16 expression was
stimulated by 17-beta-estradiol (E2), and a 2.6-kb fragment upstream of
the translation start site of LRP16 contains ESR1 (133430)
responsiveness. Using 5-prime deletion constructs in MCF7 and HeLa
cells, Zhao et al. (2005) showed that the LRP16 proximal region of -251
to -214 bp contributed to E2-induced transactivation, via an
estrogen-responsive element half-site and an SP1 (189906) binding site.
Gel mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that
ESR1 and SP1 bound directly to DNA and were required for E2-induced
transactivation of LRP16.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MACROD1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP STS-RH38365).
