DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Filamins, such as FLNC, are a family of actin (see ACTA1;
102610)-binding proteins involved in reshaping of the cytoskeleton. See
FLN1 (FLNA; 300017) for background information on the filamin gene
family.

CLONING

Xie et al. (1998) cloned FLNC, which they called ABPL, from a heart cDNA
library. The deduced 2,705-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 289 kD. ABPL contains an N-terminal actin-binding domain,
followed by 24 repeats of about 94 amino acids. It has hinge sequences
prior to repeats 16 and 24. Xie et al. (1998) also identified an
alternatively spliced transcript that encodes a protein lacking hinge 1.
PCR analysis detected transcripts encoding the hinge 1-containing
isoform in stomach, uterus, umbilical vein endothelial cells, and
prostate. Transcripts encoding both isoforms were detected in heart,
thyroid, fetal brain, fetal lung, retina, spinal cord, skeletal muscle,
and bone marrow.

Using sarcoglycan-gamma (SGCG; 608896) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a skeletal muscle cDNA library, followed by EST database
analysis and screening of a skeletal muscle cDNA library, Thompson et
al. (2000) cloned FLNC, which they called FLN2. The deduced 2,688-amino
acid protein shares 74% and 71% identity with FLN1 and filamin-beta
(FLNB; 603381), respectively, and the 3 proteins are nearly 100%
identical in the actin-binding domains. FLN2 lacks the first hinge
region present in FLN1 and FLNB, but it has the second hinge region.
Like FLN1 and FLNB, FLNC has a C-terminal domain containing binding
sites for several receptor proteins. Western blot analysis detected a
280-kD protein in heart and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Thompson et al. (2000) found that
sarcoglycan-gamma and -delta (SGCD; 601411) interacted with FLN2, but
sarcoglycan-alpha (SGCA; 600119) and -beta (SGCB; 600900) did not. In
vitro binding assays indicated that FLN2 interacted directly with
sarcoglycan-gamma and -delta, but not with dystrophin (DMD; 300377) and
syntrophin beta-1 (SNTB1; 600026). Coimmunoprecipitation analysis of
transfected proteins and of endogenous proteins in mouse myotube lysates
confirmed that FLN2 interacted with sarcoglycans-gamma and -delta. Fln2
was detected predominantly in the soluble fraction of lysed mouse
myotube cultures. Immunoelectron microscopy detected 2 pools of Fln2,
one adjacent to the sarcolemmal membrane and the other more diffuse.
Thompson et al. (2000) found elevated levels of membrane-associated FLN2
in 2 patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2C (LGMD2C;
253700), a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD; 310200), and
dystrophic mice.

The KY protein (605739) has been implicated in a neuromuscular dystrophy
in the mouse, but its role in muscle function remains unclear. Beatham
et al. (2004) showed that KY interacted with several sarcomeric
cytoskeletal proteins including filamin C and the slow isoform of the
myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC1; 160794). A role for KY in regulating
filamin C function in vivo was supported by the expression analysis of
filamin C in the Ky-null mouse mutant, where distinct irregular
subcellular localization of filamin C was found in subsets of muscle
fibers, which appeared to be a specific outcome of KY deficiency. In
vitro assays showed that KY has protease activity, and specific
degradation of filamin C by KY was shown in transfected cells. Beatham
et al. (2004) suggested that KY may be an intrinsic part of the protein
networks underlying the molecular mechanism of several limb-girdle
muscular dystrophies, particularly those where interactions between
filamin C and disease-causing proteins have been shown.

MAPPING

Gariboldi et al. (1994) mapped the FLN2 gene to human chromosome
7q32-q35 by analysis of somatic cell hybrids containing portions of
chromosome 7. Chakarova et al. (2000) assigned the FLNC gene to 7q32 by
radiation hybrid analysis.

By interspecific backcross analysis, Gariboldi et al. (1994) mapped the
mouse homolog to chromosome 6 in a region showing homology of synteny to
human chromosome 7.

- Pseudogene

An FLNC pseudogene maps to chromosome 7q32-q35 about 53.7 kb downstream
from the functional FLNC gene. The pseudogene is 98% homologous to exons
46, 47, and 48 of the functional gene (van der Ven et al., 2010).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Myofibrillar Myopathy 5

In affected members of a German family with autosomal dominant
myofibrillar myopathy-5 (MFM5; 609524), Vorgerd et al. (2005) identified
a heterozygous mutation in the FLNC gene (102565.0001).

In a German mother and daughter with adult-onset limb-girdle muscle
weakness, Shatunov et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous deletion in
the FLNC gene (102565.0002). This family was the only 1 of 127 families
with a myopathy examined that was found to have an FLNC mutation,
indicating that this subtype of myofibrillar myopathy is rare.

- Distal Myopathy 4

By linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing of an
Australian family with distal myopathy-4 (MPD4; 614065), reported by
Williams et al. (2005), Duff et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous
mutation in the FLNC gene (M251T; 102565.0003). A different heterozygous
mutation (A193T; 102565.0004) was found in affected members of an
Italian family with the same phenotype. Both mutations occurred in the
actin-binding domain, and in vitro cellular expression studies showed
that both mutations resulted in increased affinity for actin.

HISTORY

Kono et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (8107delG) in
exon 48 of the FLNC gene in affected members of a Japanese family with
adult-onset myofibrillar myopathy primarily affecting the distal limbs,
with later involvement of proximal muscles. However, the paper was later
retracted by the authors after the mutation was found to occur in the
FLNC pseudogene, based on the report of van der Ven et al. (2010). Van
der Ven et al. (2010) noted that the pseudogene is 98% homologous to
exons 46, 47, and 48 of the functional FLNC gene and that the pseudogene
contains the 8107delG variant.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYOPATHY, MYOFIBRILLAR, 5
FLNC, TRP2710TER

In affected members of a German family with autosomal dominant
myofibrillar myopathy-5 (MFM5; 609524), Vorgerd et al. (2005) identified
a heterozygous 8130G-A transition in exon 48 of the FLNC gene, resulting
in a trp2710-to-ter (W2710X) substitution. The mutation leads to a
truncation of the filamin C immunoglobulin domain that is responsible
for dimerization. Functional expression studies showed that the W2710X
protein had improper folding, was unable to form dimers, and showed
abnormal aggregation. The findings implied that dimer formation is
essential for the biologic function of filamin. The mutation was not
identified in 220 control chromosomes.

By in vitro functional expression studies, Lowe et al. (2007) showed
that W2710X-mutant protein was less stable and more susceptible to
proteolysis compared to wildtype. The mutant protein did not dimerize
properly and formed filamin aggregates in cultured cells. Aggregation of
mutant protein did not affect dimerization of wildtype filamin C, and
the mutant protein still showed normal binding to actin and
sarcoglycans.

.0002
MYOPATHY, MYOFIBRILLAR, 5
FLNC, 12-BP DEL, NT2997

In a German mother and daughter with autosomal dominant myofibrillar
myopathy-5 (609524), Shatunov et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous
12-bp deletion (2997_3008del) in exon 18 of the FLNC gene, predicted to
result in an in-frame deletion of 4 residues (val930 to thr933) in the
seventh repeat and confirmed by RT-PCR analysis of muscle tissue from
the affected daughter. The phenotype was characterized by adult-onset
muscle weakness initially involving proximal muscles of the lower limbs
and spreading to the upper limbs and distal muscles of lower
extremities. Both had paraspinal and abdominal muscle involvement and
winging of the scapula. Cardiac and respiratory muscles were not
affected. Skeletal muscle biopsy from the daughter showed marked
variation in fiber size, some fibers with internal nuclei, and type 1
fiber predominance. Several fibers showed polymorphous hyaline and
nonhyaline myofibrillary FLNC-positive inclusions with a convoluted,
serpentine appearance. Ultrastructural examination showed major
myofibrillar abnormalities, with accumulation of Z disc debris,
granulofilamentous material, and nemaline rods. There were also
mitochondrial aggregates.

.0003
MYOPATHY, DISTAL, 4
FLNC, MET251THR

In affected members of a large Australian family with autosomal dominant
distal myopathy-4 (MPD4; 614065) originally reported by Williams et al.
(2005), Duff et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 752T-C transition
in exon 4 of the FLNC gene, resulting in a met251-to-thr (M251T)
substitution in a highly conserved residue in the CH2 domain in the
actin-binding domain. The mutation was not found in 400 control
chromosomes. The mutant protein had slightly decreased thermal stability
and showed increased actin-binding activity compared to the wildtype
protein. Transfection of the mutant M251T protein into cells showed
significantly decreased nuclear localization compared to wildtype and
resulted in the formation of intracellular protein aggregates. Duff et
al. (2011) concluded that the disease mechanism somehow involves
increased affinity for actin. The phenotype was characterized by adult
onset of distal muscle weakness and atrophy affecting the upper and
lower limbs, with nonspecific findings on muscle biopsy.

.0004
MYOPATHY, DISTAL, 4
FLNC, ALA193THR

In affected members of an Italian family with autosomal dominant distal
myopathy-4 (MPD4; 614065), Duff et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous
577G-A transition in exon 2 of the FLNC gene, resulting in an
ala193-to-thr (A193T) substitution in a highly conserved residue in the
CH2 domain in the actin-binding domain. The mutation was not found in
204 control chromosomes. The mutant protein had slightly decreased
thermal stability and showed increased actin-binding activity compared
to the wildtype protein. Nuclear localization was unaltered, but
transfection resulted in the formation of intracellular protein
aggregates. Duff et al. (2011) concluded that the disease mechanism
somehow involves increased affinity for actin. The phenotype was
characterized by adult onset of distal muscle weakness and atrophy
affecting the upper and lower limbs, with nonspecific findings on muscle
biopsy.

603429	TITLE *603429 ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY F, MEMBER 1; ABCF1
;;ATP-BINDING CASSETTE 50; ABC50
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins (e.g., 601691) is
extensive and is responsible for the transport of a variety of molecules
across biologic membranes. Using differential display PCR to identify
genes that are modulated by TNF-alpha (191160) in synoviocytes, Richard
et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA encoding a novel member of the ABC family,
named ABC50. The deduced 807-amino acid ABC50 protein has 2 ABC
transporter family signature motifs, 2 ATP/GTP-binding site A motifs,
and 3 nuclear localization patterns. The authors found that ABC50 also
contains a signature sequence that is characteristic of yeast cluster IV
ABC proteins. Unlike most previously reported family members, ABC50 does
not contain a transmembrane domain. Northern blot analysis demonstrated
ubiquitous expression of a 3.7-kb ABC50 transcript in human tissues.
TNF-alpha stimulation increased the expression of the ABC50 mRNA in
cultured synoviocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Berezikov et al. (2007) determined that intron 13 of the ABCF1 gene
contains the microRNA MIRN877 (611619).

MAPPING

Richard et al. (1998) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the
human ABC50 gene to chromosome 6p21.33.

614215	TITLE *614215 ACTIVATING SIGNAL COINTEGRATOR 1 COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 1; ASCC1
;;ASC1 COMPLEX, 50-KD SUBUNIT;;
p50
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing peptides that copurified with the 650-kD ASC1 (TRIP4;
604501) complex from HeLa cells, followed by database analysis and PCR
of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Jung et al. (2002) cloned ASCC1, which they
designated p50. The deduced 357-amino acid protein contains a KH-type
RNA-binding motif near its N terminus. Northern blot analysis detected
variable expression of an approximately 2.1-kb transcript in all tissues
examined. P50 localized to both nuclei and cytoplasm of HeLa cells.
Database analysis revealed orthologs of p50 in mouse, fly, frog, and
nematode.

GENE FUNCTION

Jung et al. (2002) identified a 650-kD protein complex containing ASC1,
p50, p100 (ASCC2; 614216), and p200 (ASCC3; 614217). Immunodepletion of
p50 from HeLa cell nuclear extracts almost completely eliminated phorbol
ester-induced AP1 (see 165160) transactivation of a reporter gene. Yeast
2-hybrid analysis, coimmunoprecipitation of in vitro-translated
proteins, and protein pull-down experiments confirmed direct interaction
between p50 and p200. Domain analysis revealed that the KH motif of p50
was required its interaction with p200.

Gastrin (GAS; 137250) regulates the expression of a variety of genes
involved in the control of acid secretion. It also triggers tissue
response to damage, infection, and inflammation in cells expressing
gastrin receptor (CCKBR; 118445) and, indirectly, in nearby cells via a
paracrine mechanism. Almeida-Vega et al. (2009) found that gastrin
directly induced upregulation of the antiapoptotic regulator PAI2
(SERPINB2; 173390) in CCKBR-positive cells. CCKBR-positive cells also
released IL8 (146930) and prostaglandin E2 into the culture medium in
response to gastrin, which resulted in elevated PAI2 expression in
cocultured CCKBR-negative cells. IL8 signaling in CCKBR-negative cells
upregulated PAI2 via binding of the ASC1 complex to the PAI2 promoter.
Prostaglandin E2 independently upregulated PAI2 via RHOA
(165390)-dependent signaling that induced binding of MAZ (600999) to the
PAI2 promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that MAZ and the p50 subunit of
the ASC1 complex bound directly to sites in the PAI2 promoter. Mutation
of the putative MAZ site in the PAI2 promoter reduced responses to RHOA.
Knockdown of the p50 or p65 (TRIP4) subunits of the ASC1 complex via
small interfering RNA significantly reduced PAI2 upregulation in
response to gastrin.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the ASCC1 gene to chromosome 10q22.1 based on an
alignment of the ASCC1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF132952) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Orloff et al. (2011) identified a germline asn290-to-ser (N290S;
614215.0001) mutation in the ASCC1 gene in 2 (2.1%) of 116 patients of
European descent with Barrett esophagus and/or esophageal adenocarcinoma
(614266). The mutation was not found in 125 controls. This genomic
region was studied after being identified by genomewide linkage analysis
of 21 concordant and 11 discordant sib pairs with the disorders.

603200	TITLE *603200 REGULATORY FACTOR X, ANKYRIN REPEAT-CONTAINING; RFXANK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Major histocompatibility (MHC) class II molecules are transmembrane
proteins that have a central role in development and control of the
immune system. They are encoded by a multigene family and their
expression is tightly regulated. MHC class II deficiency (209920) is an
autosomal recessive immunodeficiency syndrome resulting from defects in
transacting factors essential for transcription of MHC class II genes.
There are 4 genetic complementation groups (A, B, C, and D), reflecting
the existence of 4 MHC class II regulators. The factor defective in
group A is CIITA, or MHC class II transactivator (MHCTA; 600005); in
group C, regulatory factor-5 (RFX5; 601863); and in group D, regulatory
factor X-associated protein (RFXAP; 601861). CIITA is a non-DNA-binding
coactivator that controls the cell type specificity and inducibility of
MHC class II expression. RFX5 and RFXAP are 2 subunits of RFX, a
multiprotein complex that binds the X box motif of MHC class II
promoters. Mutations in the genes encoding RFX5 or RFXAP abolish binding
of RFX to DNA. Similar to groups C and D, group B is characterized by a
defect in RFX binding, and although it accounts for the majority of
patients, the factor defective in group B remained unknown until
Masternak et al. (1998) isolated RFX by a novel single-step DNA-affinity
purification approach and identified RFXANK, the gene encoding the third
subunit of RFX. RFXANK restored MHC class II expression in cell lines
from patients in group B and was found to be mutated in these patients.
RFXANK contains a protein-protein interaction region consisting of 3
ankyrin repeats. Its interaction with RFX5 and RFXAP is essential for
binding of the RFX complex to MHC class II promoters. The gene was
symbolized RFXANK because the protein contains 3 ankyrin repeats.
Wiszniewski et al. (2000) stated that, since the first description of
combined immunodeficiency due to absence of MHC class II molecule
expression, about 70 patients from 50 families had been reported. Of the
4 complementation groups described, the largest had been group B. Most
of the patients in this category had been of North African origin.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Nekrep et al. (2000) demonstrated a direct interaction between the C
terminus of RFXAP and RFXANK; mutant RFXAP or RFXANK proteins failed to
bind. The authors found that RFX5 binds only to the RFXANK-RFXAP
scaffold and not to either protein alone. However, neither the scaffold
nor RFX5 alone can bind DNA. Nekrep et al. (2000) concluded that the
binding of the RFXANK-RFXAP scaffold to RFX5 leads to a conformational
change in the latter that exposes the DNA-binding domain of RFX5. The
DNA-binding domain of RFX5 anchors the RFX complex to the MHC class II X
and S promoter boxes. Another part of the RFX5 protein interacts with
MHC2TA. The authors pointed out that mutation of either protein in
complementation group B or group D of BLS patients prevents its binding
to the other protein, explaining why MHC class II promoters are bare in
the bare lymphocyte syndrome.

GENE STRUCTURE

Masternak et al. (1998) found that the RFXANK gene is composed of 10
exons spanning approximately 10 kb.

MAPPING

Masternak et al. (1998) reported that the RFXANK gene is located on
19p12 between MEF2B (600661) and CSPG3 (600826). This mapping was
accomplished by genomic DNA sequence information which referred them to
specific cosmids that were part of the Lawrence-Livermore chromosome 19
sequencing work.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lennon-Dumenil et al. (2001) described a patient of North African origin
with the classic features of MHC class II deficiency. The patient had a
homozygous mutation affecting a splice donor site downstream of exon 4
of the RFXANK gene (603200.0003), resulting in a premature stop codon
and an inactive protein lacking all 3 ankyrin domains. Northern and
Western blot analyses of a cell line established from the patient
revealed a lack of expression of HLA-DPA (142880), HLA-DRB (142857),
HLA-DQB (604305), and HLA-DPB (142858), but near normal expression of
HLA-DRA (142860) and HLA-DQA (146880). The authors identified an
alternatively spliced RFXANK gene product that lacks exon 4, resulting
in a 28-amino acid deletion, and complementation and cytofluorometric
analyses confirmed that this alternative RFXANK cDNA could rescue
HLA-DRA and HLA-DRB expression.

Wiszniewski et al. (2003) stated that 7 different RFXANK mutations had
been reported in 26 unrelated patients with MHC class II deficiency.
They reported 2 novel mutations, including D121V (603200.0004),
resulting in loss of function of the gene.

RFXANK, 26-BP DEL, NT752

In 2 unrelated patients with bare lymphocyte syndrome type II,
complementation group B (209920), Masternak et al. (1998) found a 26-bp
deletion of genomic DNA that removed the splice acceptor site and the
first nucleotide of exon 6 of the RFXANK gene. In 1 of these families,
reported by Lisowska-Grospierre et al. (1994), the parents were known to
be consanguineous. In both families, homozygosity was confirmed by
analysis of DNA from other family members.

Wiszniewski et al. (2000) performed a mutation analysis in 20 additional
patients belonging to complementation group B and detected the 26-bp
deletion beginning with 752G in 17 patients, all of North African
origin. A founder effect was documented, since all tested patients,
except 1, displayed a common haplotype spanning the RFXANK locus.

In a patient with bare lymphocyte syndrome type II, complementation type

DNA that removed the last 23 nucleotides and the splice donor site of
exon 6 of the RFXANK gene.

Lennon-Dumenil et al. (2001) described a patient of North African origin
with MHC class II deficiency (209920). The patient had a homozygous 1-bp
transversion (G to C) that abolished the splice site downstream of exon
4 of the RFXANK gene, resulting in a premature stop codon and an
inactive protein lacking all 3 ankyrin domains. Northern and Western
blot analyses of a cell line established from the patient revealed a
lack of expression of HLA-DPA (142880), HLA-DRB (142857), HLA-DQB
(604305), and HLA-DPB (142858), but near normal expression of HLA-DRA
(142860) and HLA-DQA (146880). The authors identified an alternatively
spliced RFXANK gene product that lacks exon 4, resulting in a 28-amino

confirmed that this alternative RFXANK cDNA could rescue HLA-DRA and
HLA-DRB expression.

Wiszniewski et al. (2003) identified an asp121-to-val (D121V) missense
mutation in the RFXANK gene. The D121V mutant was unable to form the RFX
complex, indicating that D121 is required for RFXAP binding.

603819	TITLE *603819 STEROID RECEPTOR RNA ACTIVATOR 1; SRA1
;;SRA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screening system, Lanz et al. (1999) isolated a
transcriptional coactivator of steroid nuclear receptors, termed steroid
receptor RNA activator (SRA). Northern blot analysis revealed that the
SRA gene was expressed in all human tissues tested as major transcripts
of approximately 0.7 to 0.85 kb and minor transcripts of approximately
1.3 to 1.5 kb; SRA was expressed at high levels in liver and skeletal
muscle and at a low level in brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Lanz et al. (1999) found that SRA was selective for steroid hormone
receptors and mediated transactivation via their N-terminal activation
function. The authors provided functional and mechanistic evidence that
SRA acts as an RNA transcript; transfected SRA, unlike other steroid
receptor coregulators, functioned in the presence of cycloheximide, and
SRA mutants containing multiple translational stop signals retained
their ability to activate steroid receptor-dependent gene expression.
Biochemical fractionation showed that SRA exists in distinct
ribonucleoprotein complexes, one of which contains steroid receptor
coactivator-1 (602691). Lanz et al. (1999) suggested that SRA may act to
confer functional specificity upon multiprotein complexes recruited by
liganded receptors during transcriptional activation.

By immunoprecipitation analysis, Caretti et al. (2006) found that p68
(DDX5; 180630), p72 (DDX17; 608469), and the noncoding RNA SRA
associated with MYOD (MYOD1; 159970) in MYOD-transfected HeLa cells. In
vitro and in vivo experiments identified p68, p72, and SRA as
coactivators of MYOD, and their knockdown in C2C12 mouse myoblast cells
prevented proper muscle gene expression and cell differentiation.

MAPPING

By sequence comparisons, Lanz et al. (1999) identified partial SRA
sequences isolated as HepG2 3-prime untranslated region (GenBank GENBANK
D16861), EST clones, and chromosome 5 BAC clone 319C17 (GenBank GENBANK
AC005214), providing a preliminary mapping of the SRA gene to chromosome
5.

608503	TITLE *608503 POLY(rC)-BINDING PROTEIN 4; PCBP4
;;ALPHA-CP4;;
MCG10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The poly(rC)-binding proteins are a subfamily of KH-domain-containing
RNA-binding proteins that bind C-rich pyrimidine tracts and play pivotal
roles in a broad spectrum of posttranscriptional events (Chkheidze and
Liebhaber, 2003).

CLONING

By subtraction hybridization for genes induced by p53 (191170) in a lung
cancer cell line, Zhu and Chen (2000) cloned PCBP4, which they
designated MCG10. They also identified an alternatively spliced
transcript, which they designated MCG10as. The deduced proteins contain
424 and 369 amino acids. Each protein contains an N-terminal KH (HNRNPK
(600712)-homology) domain, a C-terminal KH domain, 3 proline-rich
domains, a potential nuclear export signal, and a potential nuclear
localization signal.

Based on its sequence similarity with mouse and human PCBP2 (601210),
Makeyev and Liebhaber (2000) cloned mouse Pcbp4, and using this sequence
as query to search an EST database, they identified human PCBP4. Both
mouse and human PCBP4 encode 403-amino acid proteins with calculated
molecular masses of 41.5 kD. PCBP4 contains 2 KH domains in the
N-terminal half, and 1 near the C terminus. Quantitative RT-PCR detected
expression in all mouse tissues examined.

Chkheidze and Liebhaber (2003) cloned a PCBP4 transcript that encodes a
deduced 329-amino acid protein. Epitope-tagged PCBP4 localized to the
cytosol of transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhu and Chen (2000) found that PCBP4 was induced following p53
expression in a lung cancer cell line. Expression of a p53 mutant
defective in transactivation, and a p53 lacking the proline-rich domain,
did not induce PCBP4 expression. Chemically-induced DNA damage also led
to p53-dependent PCBP4 upregulation. By generating cell lines that
inducibly expressed either wildtype or mutated forms of the 2 PCBP4
splice variants, Zhu and Chen (2000) found that both variants suppressed
cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in
G(2)-M. Through their KH domains, both variants bound poly(rC) and their
RNA-binding activity was necessary to induce apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhu and Chen (2000) identified 3 potential p53-binding sites in the
untranslated region upstream of the PCBP4 transcription start site.
Makeyev and Liebhaber (2000) determined that the PCBP4 gene contains 14
exons and spans 9.8 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhu and Chen (2000) and Makeyev and
Liebhaber (2000) mapped the PCBP4 gene to chromosome 3p21. By FISH,
Makeyev and Liebhaber (2000) mapped the mouse Pcbp4 gene to a syntenic
region of mouse chromosome 9F1-F2.

136836	TITLE *136836 FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE 6; FUT6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferases constitute a large family of
glycosyltransferases with a high degree of homology. The enzymes of this
family comprise 3 main activity patterns called myeloid, plasma, and
Lewis, based on their capacity to transfer alpha-L-fucose to distinct
oligosaccharide acceptors, their sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide
inhibition, their cation requirements, and their tissue-specific
expression patterns. The different categories of
alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferases are sequentially expressed during
embryo-fetal development. FUT6 encodes a 'plasma type' of
alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase (summary by Mollicone et al., 1994).

CLONING

Weston et al. (1992) isolated and cloned a novel
alpha(1,3)fucosyltransferase gene, which they designated FUT6, which
encodes a deduced 358-amino acid protein. FUT6 shares 85% and 89% amino
acid sequence identity with FUT3 (111100) and FUT5 (136835),
respectively, but differs substantially in its acceptor substrate
requirements.

Koszdin and Bowen (1992) amplified FUT6 by PCR of a squamous carcinoma
cell line and a myeloid leukemia cell line.

Cameron et al. (1995) studied the tissue distribution of FUT6 by RT-PCR,
RACE, and Northern blot analysis. They found that FUT6 was expressed at
high levels as a 3.5-kb transcript in kidney and liver and as a 2.5-kb
transcript in colon and liver. They identified alternate polyadenylation
sites as well as splice variants resulting in deletion of the catalytic
domain. By RT-PCR, Schnyder-Candrian et al. (2000) found FUT6 to be the
major fucosyltransferase of human umbilical vein endothelial cells.
Immunolocalization showed that FUT6 colocalizes with
beta-4-galactosyltransferase-1 (B4GALT1; 137060) in compact juxtanuclear
structures typical of the Golgi apparatus. Antibodies raised against
another epitope of FUT6 localized the enzyme to Weibel-Palade bodies,
endothelial storage granules.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNAs, Weston et al. (1992)
demonstrated that the FUT6 gene is located on chromosome 19, where the
Lewis blood group gene (FUT3; 111100) had long been known to be located.

McCurley et al. (1995) demonstrated that FUT5, FUT3, and FUT6 are
located in the 19p13.3 region in an interval of about 40 kb. They are
situated in close proximity and the direction of transcription of all 3
is toward the telomere. The organization may suggest coordinate
regulation.

GENE FUNCTION

Weston et al. (1992) found that when FUT6 was transfected into mammalian
cells, it was capable of directing expression of the Lewis x, sialyl
Lewis x, and difucosyl sialyl Lewis x epitopes.

Koszdin and Bowen (1992) also showed that transfection of FUT6 cDNA into
mammalian cells conferred alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase activity to the
cells, resulting in cell surface expression of Lewis x and sialyl Lewis
x carbohydrates.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Whereas most humans express an alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase in plasma,
9% of individuals on the isle of Java (Indonesia) do not express this
enzyme. The Lewis negative phenotype is found on red cells of 95% of
these FUT-deficient individuals, suggesting strong linkage
disequilibrium between these 2 traits. To define a molecular basis for
this plasma FUT deficiency (613852) and to determine which of 2
candidate human FUT genes, FUT5 (136835) and FUT6, encode this enzyme,
Mollicone et al. (1994) cloned and analyzed alleles at these 2 loci from
an Indonesian individual with fucosyltransferase deficiency. Single
basepair changes were identified in the coding region of each gene,
yielding 3 codon changes in FUT5 and 3 in FUT6. Only the changes in the
FUT6 alleles inactivated the gene when tested by expression in
transfected COS-1 cells. One of these inactivating changes was a
missense mutation (glu247-to-lys) within the enzyme's catalytic domain.
The other inactivating mutation, a nonsense tyr315-to-ter change,
truncated the C terminus of the enzyme by 45 amino acids. The
glu247-to-lys missense mutation was present in homozygous state in 9
plasma FUT-deficient individuals tested, whereas the nonsense mutation
at tyrosine-315 was present in homozygous state in only 1 of these 9
persons. These results demonstrated that the
alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase activity in human plasma is encoded by the
FUT6 gene and that the missense mutation within codon 247 of this gene
is responsible for the Indonesian deficiency of this activity.

Brinkman-Van der Linden et al. (1996) found that all individuals with a
homozygous gly739-to-ala FUT6 mutation showed no fucosylation of
alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The same result was found for
alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and alpha-1-protease inhibitor. On the other
hand, in all individuals with alpha-3-fucosyltransferase activity in the
plasma, alpha-3-fucosylated glycoforms of the glycoproteins studied were
found. Thus, their data suggested that the product of FUT6, but not of
FUT3 or of FUT5, is responsible for the alpha-3-fucosylation of
glycoproteins produced in liver and suggested that this organ is a major
source of alpha-3-fucosyltransferase activity in plasma.

Pang et al. (1999) sequenced the 1080-bp coding region of the FUT6 gene
in 161 individuals (322 chromosomes) drawn from 3 populations: 56
Africans (Xhosa), 52 European-Africans of South Africa, and 53 Japanese.
In addition to 6 base substitutions previously reported, 11 new base
substitutions and a single base insertion were found. They also
identified 11 functional and 4 null alleles, of which 10 were novel. The
allelic distributions of FUT6 were different among these 3 populations.
The heterozygosity of FUT6 was 0.860, 0.699, and 0.632 in the 3
populations, respectively. Pang et al. (1999) suggested that the
extensive DNA sequence diversity of FUT6 may make it suitable as a tool
in genetic studies of modern human evolution.

609178	TITLE *609178 MIS12, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF; MIS12
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to yeast Mis12, followed by PCR of a
HeLa cell cDNA library, Goshima et al. (2003) cloned MIS12. The deduced
205-amino acid protein contains 2 conserved blocks in its N-terminal 100
amino acids, followed by a coiled-coil region of about 50 amino acids.
Endogenous HeLa cell MIS12 had an apparent molecular mass of about 25
kD. Immunolocalization showed MIS12 colocalized at kinetochores with
CENPA (117139) and CENPC (117141), and its position during the cell
cycle was that of a typical kinetochore protein. The level of MIS12 did
not fluctuate during the cell cycle.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RNA interference (RNAi) in HeLa cells, Goshima et al. (2003)
demonstrated that reduced MIS12 resulted in misaligned metaphase
chromosomes, abnormally extended metaphase spindle length, lagging
anaphase chromosomes, and interphase micronuclei without mitotic delay.
Spindle checkpoint protein MAD2 (601467) temporally localized at
kinetochores at early mitotic stages after MIS12 RNAi. Kinetochore
localization of MIS12 was unaffected by CENPA RNAi.

Following MIS12 overexpression in HeLa cells, Obuse et al. (2004)
immunoprecipitated MIS12 in a kinetochore-associated complex that
contained PMF1 (609176), DC8 (609174), C20ORF172 (609175), and HP1-alpha
(CBX5; 604478). ZWINT (609177) also associated with the complex at
kinetochores during mitosis. Immunoprecipitation of transfected cells
indicated that MIS12 could form stable complexes with C20ORF172 and DC8.
Much weaker interaction was detected between MIS12 and ZWINT. Exclusion
chromatography revealed 3 peaks containing MIS12 and C20ORF172, but only
the middle peak, which had a mass of 669 kD, contained HP1-alpha. MIS12
knockdown by RNAi abolished the kinetochore association of ZWINT, DC8,
and C20ORF172.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MIS12
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP SHGC-36031).

;;UBIQUITIN-BINDING PROTEIN P62; P62
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Src homology type 2 (SH2) domain is a highly conserved motif of
about 100 amino acids which mediates protein-protein interactions by
binding to phosphotyrosine. p56-lck (153390), a T-cell-specific src
family tyrosine kinase with an SH2 domain, is involved in T-cell signal
transduction. A 62-kD protein (p62) was identified by Park et al. (1995)
as a ligand of the p56-lck SH2 domain.

Joung et al. (1996) cloned the gene for p62 by purifying the p62 protein
to obtain peptide microsequences, producing a PCR product with
degenerate oligonucleotides, and then using this PCR product to screen a
HeLa cell cDNA library. Sequence analysis of full-length cDNAs by Joung
et al. (1996) revealed that the p62 gene encodes a 440-amino acid
polypeptide with the following conserved domains: (1) a cysteine-rich
domain, predicted to be a metal-binding site involved in protein-protein
or protein-DNA interaction; (2) a region with homology to the cdc42
GTPase binding-site; and (3) a PEST motif which is a degradation signal
found in many short-lived proteins. Northern blot analysis suggested
that p62 is expressed ubiquitously in all tissues examined.

Gong et al. (1999) screened a yeast 2-hybrid library made from rat
hippocampal mRNA against full-length Kv-beta-2 (601142). Two previously
unknown interacting proteins were identified, one of which was identical
to Zip (PKC-zeta (176982)-interacting protein), the rat homolog of p62.
Zip1 and Zip2, which arise from alternative splicing, are identical
except for 27 residues missing from Zip2.

GENE FUNCTION

Park et al. (1995) found that the p56-lck SH2 domain binds to p62 at the
ser59 of p62 only when that serine is phosphorylated. Moreover, Park et
al. (1995) found that p62 is associated with a serine/threonine kinase
activity and also binds to ras GTP-ase-activating protein, a negative
regulator of the ras signaling pathway.

Joung et al. (1996) expressed epitope-tagged p62 in HeLa cells and
showed that the expressed protein bound to the lck SH2 domain and that
this binding was dependent on the N-terminal 50 amino acids of p62 but
not on the tyrosine residue in this region. Thus Joung et al. (1996)
proposed that the mechanism of binding of p62 to the p56-lck SH2 domain
is by a mechanism different from the previously characterized modes of
binding of SH2 domains and their ligands.

Vadlamudi et al. (1996) used the yeast 2-hybrid system to identify
proteins that interact with p62. They isolated 46 clones that tested
positively for specific interaction with p62. Forty-three of the 46
clones were found by sequencing to be members of the ubiquitin family.
Ubiquitination of cellular proteins is a crucial feature in regulation
of signal transduction and cell cycle progression through
ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal degradation of important cellular
proteins. Vadlamudi et al. (1996) studied the interaction of p62 with
ubiquitin by in vitro binding studies which showed that p62 binds
noncovalently to ubiquitin. Vadlamudi et al. (1996) noted that p62
contains no homology with any known ubiquitin-binding protein and thus
represents a new class of ubiquitin-binding protein.

Gong et al. (1999) found that the rat Zip1 and Zip2 isoforms
differentially stimulated phosphorylation of Kv-beta-2 by PKC-zeta. Zip1
and Zip2 interacted to form heteromultimers, allowing for a hybrid
stimulatory activity to PKC-zeta. Gong et al. (1999) found that Zip1 and
Zip2 coexisted in the same cell type and were elevated differentially by
neurotrophic factors. They suggested that these results provide a
mechanism for specificity and regulation of PKC-zeta-targeted
phosphorylation.

By small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Rab factors in a murine
macrophage line, Pilli et al. (2012) showed that inhibition of Rab8b
(613532) caused a decrease in conversion of Mycobacterium bovis BCG
phagosomes to degradative compartments after the induction of autophagy
and autophagic killing of mycobacteria. Knockdown of Rab8b-interacting
partners showed that Tbk1 (604834) was critical for autophagic killing
of BCG by suppressing the maturation of autophagosomes.
Coimmunoprecipitation, proximity ligation in situ analysis, and confocal
microscopy revealed that Tbk1 associated with Rab8b on autophagic
organelles. High-content imaging analysis showed that Tbk1 was required
in bone marrow macrophages for phosphorylation of p62 on ser403, which
was in turn required for autophagic function and clearance of p62 and
associated cargo. Further analysis revealed that Il1b was necessary for
the induction of autophagy in mycobacteria-infected macrophages and that
Tbk1 was required for Il1b-induced autophagic elimination of M.
tuberculosis.

Lee et al. (2012) showed that the atypical (i.e., nontuberculous)
mycobacterium M. abscessus (Mabc) robustly activated the NLRP3 (606416)
inflammasome in human macrophages via dectin-1 (CLEC7A; 606264)/SYK
(600085)-dependent signaling and the cytoplasmic scaffold protein
SQSTM1. Both dectin-1 and TLR2 (603028) were required for Mabc-induced
expression of IL1B (147720), CAMP (600474), and DEFB4 (DEFB4A; 602215).
Dectin-1-dependent SYK signaling, but not MYD88 (602170) signaling, led
to activation of CASP1 (147678) and secretion of IL1B through a
potassium efflux-dependent NLRP3/ASC (PYCARD; 606838) inflammasome.
Mabc-induced SQSTM1 expression was also critically involved in NLRP3
inflammasome activation. Lee et al. (2012) concluded that the NLRP3/ASC
inflammasome is critical for antimicrobial responses and innate immunity
to Mabc infection.

GENE STRUCTURE

The 2,870-nucleotide SQSTM1 transcript is contained within 8 exons
distributed over a 16-kb genomic segment (Laurin et al., 2002).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the p62
gene to chromosome 5q35 (TMAP sts-Z40707).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using 24 French Canadian families and 112 unrelated individuals with
Paget disease of bone (602080), Laurin et al. (2002) confined the PDB3
locus (602080) on 5q35-qter to a region of approximately 300 kb. Within
this interval, 2 disease-related haplotype signatures were observed in
11 families and 18 unrelated patients. This region encoded the SQSTM1
gene, which is a candidate gene for PDB because of its association with
the RANK pathway (see 603499). Screening SQSTM1 for mutations led to the
identification of a recurrent nonconservative change (P392L;
601530.0001) flanking the ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA; position
394-440) of the protein that was not present in 291 control individuals.
The data demonstrated that 2 independent mutational events at the same
position in SQSTM1 cause Paget disease of bone in a high proportion of
French Canadian patients.

Kurihara et al. (2007) found that osteoclast precursors from PDB
patients with the P392L mutation and osteoclast precursors transduced
with p62 protein carrying the P392L mutation were hyperresponsive to
RANKL (TNFSF11; 602642) and TNF (191160) compared with control
osteoclast precursors. Mice transgenic for P392L developed increased
osteoclast numbers and progressive bone loss, but they did not manifest
the increased osteoblast numbers seen in PDB. Kurihara et al. (2007)
concluded that expression of P392L in osteoclasts is necessary to cause
predisposition to PDB, but it is not sufficient for the full PDB
phenotype.

ANIMAL MODEL

Inactivation of constitutive autophagy results in formation of
cytoplasmic protein inclusions and leads to liver injury and
neurodegeneration. Using proteomic, immunoprecipitation, and
immunofluorescence microscopy analyses, Komatsu et al. (2007) found that
p62 interacted with LC3 (MAP1LC3A; 601242) in mouse lysosomes and
autophagosomes. p62 accumulated in autophagy-deficient mouse livers and
neurons lacking Atg5 (604261) or Atg7 (608760). Mice lacking p62 were
fertile and lived more than 1 year, although they developed adult-onset
obesity and diabetes. p62 -/- Atg7 -/- double-knockout mice did not
accumulate ubiquitin protein inclusions in neurons or livers. Komatsu et
al. (2007) concluded that p62 levels are regulated by autophagy and that
the pathology of autophagy deficiency is cell type specific.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PAGET DISEASE OF BONE
SQSTM1, PRO392LEU

In 8 families showing linkage of Paget disease (602080) to the PDB3
locus on 5q, Laurin et al. (2002) used a haplotype signature strategy to
find ancestral haplotypes shared by affected individuals to narrow the
mapping interval. The SQSTM1 gene, which maps to that interval, was
found to have a C-to-T transition at position 1215 in exon 8 in all 5
affected individuals tested. This change caused the substitution of
proline-392 to a leucine (P392L). The P392L mutation was found in 18
(16%) of 112 sporadic cases and in 11 (46%) of 24 families with Paget
disease tested. Haplotype analysis by means of intragenic SNPs showed
that the P392L mutation was associated with 2 distinct haplotypes and
probably originated from 2 independent events. This mutation, occurring
at a hypermutable CpG dinucleotide, may have arisen by deamination of a
methylated cytosine.

.0002
PAGET DISEASE OF BONE
SQSTM1, 1-BP INS, 1224T

Hocking et al. (2002) identified 4 of 62 PDB (602080) families whose
affected members were heterozygous for a T insertion after base 1224 in
the SQSTM1 gene. The mutation was predicted to result in premature
termination at codon 396 in the ubiquitin-binding domain.

.0003
PAGET DISEASE OF BONE
SQSTM1, IVS7, G-A, +1

Hocking et al. (2002) identified an Australian family with PDB (602080)
whose affected members were heterozygous for a G-to-A substitution at
splice donor site IVS7+1 of the SQSTM1 gene. The mutation was predicted
to result in skipping of exon 7, which encodes part of the
ubiquitin-binding domain.

604783	TITLE *604783 CLEFT LIP- AND PALATE-ASSOCIATED TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 1; CLPTM1
DESCRIPTION Yoshiura et al. (1998) identified a family in which cleft lip and palate
(119530) segregated in 2 of 3 generations with a balanced chromosomal
translocation t(2;19)(q11.2;q13.3). They identified a novel gene on
chromosome 19, which they named 'cleft lip- and palate-associated
transmembrane protein-1' (CLPTM1), by positional cloning. Assembled cDNA
sequences and comparison with genomic sequences predicted a gene with 13
exons encoding a putative protein with 7 transmembrane domains highly
conserved between human and C. elegans. Yoshiura et al. (1998) found
ubiquitous expression of a 2.6-kb transcript using Northern blot
analysis of various adult human tissues and whole-mount in situ
hybridization to day 10-12 postconception mouse embryos. Using SSCP
analysis in sporadic cases of clefting and direct sequencing of coding
sequences in familial cases, Yoshiura et al. (1998) identified no
pathologic mutations.

612606	TITLE *612606 LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE PROTEIN 1D; LCE1D
;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 4; LEP4
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE1D,
which they called LEP4.

Using real-time PCR with primers that did not differentiate between
LCE1D and LCE1E (612607), Jackson et al. (2005) detected moderate
LCE1D/E expression in human fetal, arm, penal, and abdominal skin. Much
lower expression was detected in vulva, and little to no expression was
detected in tongue and esophagus.

GENE FUNCTION

Marshall et al. (2001) showed that Lep4 was expressed in cultured mouse
keratinocytes only after calcium induction. It was not associated with
cornified cells until 4 to 5 days after calcium induction. In situ
assays showed that Lep4 was a transglutaminase substrate and was
incorporated at the cell periphery in a calcium-dependent manner. The
incorporated protein was resistant to heat and detergent, consistent
with stable crosslinking of Lep4 into the cornified envelope.

Jackson et al. (2005) showed that expression LCE1 genes, including
LCE1D/E, was upregulated in cultured normal human keratinocytes by
ultraviolet irradiation, but not by calcium. Real-time PCR of skin
biopsies from 4 normal individuals revealed an individual who lacked
LCE1D/E almost completely. This individual did not have a major skin
defect, suggesting that loss of 1 of these genes has only minor
consequences.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that the LCE1D gene contains 2 exons.
Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE1D
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) stated that the mouse Lce1d gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene
cluster on chromosome 3F1.

614463	TITLE *614463 NMYC DOWNSTREAM-REGULATED GENE 4; NDRG4
;;SMOOTH MUSCLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 8; SMAP8;;
KIAA1180
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Hirosawa et al. (1999) cloned NDRG4. The deduced protein
contains 273 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest expression in
adult and fetal brain and adult heart, followed by lung and testis.
Lower expression was detected in other adult tissues examined, but
little to no expression was detected in fetal liver. High NDRG4
expression was detected in all specific adult brain regions examined,
with highest expression in amygdala, cerebellum, and thalamus.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to NDRG1 (605262),
followed by 3-prime and 5-prime RACE of human brain and heart cDNA
libraries and cap-site hunting, Zhou et al. (2001) cloned 3 splice
variants of NDRG4. The variants NDRG4B and NDRG4B-var, which were
obtained from the brain library, encode deduced proteins of 339 and 352
amino acids with calculated molecular masses of 37.1 and 38.5 kD,
respectively. Compared with NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var has a 14-amino acid
insertion near the C terminus. The variant NDRG4H, which was obtained
from the heart library, encodes a deduced 371-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of 40.6 kD. NDRG4H differs from NDRG4B and
NDRG4B-var at its N-terminal end, and it lacks the 14-amino acid
insertion. Northern blot analysis detected NDRG4 transcripts of about
3.2 kb in brain and heart only. Variant-specific probes showed NDRG4B
expression in brain only, whereas NDRG4H was expressed in both brain and
heart, with higher expression in heart. RT-PCR confirmed expression of
all 3 variants in brain and of NDRG4H in heart. RNA dot-blot analysis
revealed NDRG4 expression in spinal cord, all specific brain regions
examined, and all specific heart regions examined except aorta.
Expression was also detected in spleen, lymph node, testis, adrenal
gland, and fetal brain and heart, but not in other tissues examined. In
situ hybridization of normal adult brain detected NDRG4 mRNA in
cytoplasm of neurons in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, mesencephalon,
pons, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. No signal was detected in
peripheral nerves or other cell types, such as glial cells. Western blot
analysis of endogenous or exogenously expressed proteins showed that
NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var, and NDRG4H had apparent molecular masses of 37, 39,
and 41 kD, respectively.

Using expression profiling to identify genes expressed in aortic smooth
muscle, followed by screening a heart cDNA library, Nishimoto et al.
(2003) cloned NDRG4, which they called SMAP8. The deduced 371-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 40.7 kD. Northern blot
analysis detected high expression of an approximately 3.3-kb transcript
in heart and brain, with little to no expression in other tissues
examined. PCR analysis showed moderate expression in aorta and vascular
smooth muscle cells. Western blot analysis of heart and brain detected
SMAP8 at an apparent molecular mass of about 45 kD. SMAP8 localized to
the cytoplasmic fraction of transfected A10 embryonic rat aortic smooth
muscle cells.

By in situ hybridization of adult mouse brain, Yamamoto et al. (2011)
detected wide distribution of Ndrg4 in neurons, but not in astrocytes.
Western blot analysis of adult mouse brain detected 3 Ndrg4 isoforms
representing orthologs of human NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var, and NDRG4H.

GENE FUNCTION

Nishimoto et al. (2003) showed that homocysteine upregulated SMAP8
expression in primary human aortic smooth muscle cells and rat A10
cells, but not in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Proliferation
and migration of A10 cells significantly decreased following expression
of human SMAP8. SMAP8 was phosphorylated by a serine/threonine kinase
via activation of a PDGF (see 173430) signaling pathway. In addition,
ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948) and MEK1 (MAP2K1; 176872)/MEK2
(MAP2K2; 601263) were activated in SMAP8-transfected A10 cells.

Hongo et al. (2006) found that overexpression of 1 of the 6 isoforms of
rat Ndrg4, Ndrg4c2, in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells reduced NGF (see
162030)-induced phosphorylation of Elk1 (311040), a nuclear target of
Erk. Reporter gene assays revealed that Ndrg4c2 suppressed Elk1-mediated
activation of a serum response element.

By RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis, Schilling et al. (2009)
found that NDRG4 expression was increased in glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM; see 137800) compared with normal human astrocytes. Knockdown of
NDRG4 via short hairpin RNA reduced the viability of GBM cells via G1
cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis. Knockdown of NDRG4 also
reduced the viability of several GBM cell lines and primary astrocytes.
Knockdown of NDRG4 in GBM tumor xenografts reduced tumor growth
following intracranial injection in immunocompromised mice.
Overexpression of NDRG4B or NDRG4H did not affect cell viability.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhou et al. (2001) determined that the NDRG4 gene contains 17 exons and
spans 26 kb. Exons 1 and 2 are specific for NDRG4H, exon 3 is specific
for NDRG4B and NDGR4B-var, and exon 16 is specific for NDRG4B-var. The
region upstream of exon 1 contains a GGCG sequence that may represent a
TATA-less promoter for NDRG4H expression. The region upstream of exon 3
contains a consensus TATA box and 2 CCAAT sequences and may represent
the promoter for NDRG4B and NDRG4B-var expression.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhou et al. (2001) mapped the NDRG4 gene
to chromosome 16q21-q22.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yamamoto et al. (2011) found that Ndrg4 -/- mice were born at the
expected mendelian ratio, appeared normal, and were fertile. However,
Ndrg4 -/- mice showed deficits in spatial learning and memory, and they
exhibited increased sensitivity to ischemic stress following middle
cerebral artery occlusion. Consistent with these findings, Ndrg4 -/-
mice had reduced expression of the neuroprotective factor Bdnf (113505).

;;CHONDROITIN SULFATE PROTEOGLYCAN 2; CSPG2;;
CHONDROITIN SULFATE PROTEOGLYCAN CORE PROTEIN, CARTILAGE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans were first identified in hyaline
cartilage, where they specifically interact with hyaluronan and form
large supramolecular complexes. Together with other matrix
glycoproteins, they provide mechanical support and a fixed negative
charge. Such molecules exist also in a variety of soft tissues where
they may play additional physiologic roles (Kjellen and Lindahl, 1991).

CLONING

Zimmermann and Ruoslahti (1989) cloned and sequenced the cDNA of the
core protein of fibroblast chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. They
designated it versican in recognition of its versatile modular
structure. Decorin (125255) and biglycan (301870) are 2 other soft
tissue proteoglycans.

Naso et al. (1995) reported that the mouse versican protein is 89%
identical to human versican and is highly expressed in mouse embryos at
days 13, 14, and 18.

Dours-Zimmermann and Zimmermann (1994) provided evidence for the
existence of 3 versican splice variants, designated V0, V1, and V2,
which differ in the length of their glycosaminoglycan attachment portion
inserted between the globular modules at the N- and C-terminal ends of
the core proteins. Versican V1 and V2 include either the GAG-alpha or
the GAG-beta domain providing attachment sites for about 5 to 8 or 12 to
15 glycosaminoglycan chains, respectively. In the V0 variant, both
GAG-alpha and GAG-beta are present. Zako et al. (1995) demonstrated the
existence of another splice variant, designated V3, which lacks a
chondroitin sulfate attachment region, the most distinctive portion of a
proteoglycan molecule.

Bode-Lesniewska et al. (1996) studied the distribution of versican by
using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies that recognize the core
protein of the prominent versican splice variants V0 and V1. Versican
was present in the loose connective tissues of various organs and was
often associated with the elastic fiber network. It was localized in
most smooth muscle tissues and in fibrous and elastic cartilage.
Versican staining was noted in the central and peripheral nervous
system, in the basal layer of the epidermis, and on the luminal surface
of some glandular epithelia. In blood vessels, versican was present in
all 3 wall layers of veins and elastic arteries. In muscular arteries
the immunoreactivity was normally restricted to the tunica adventitia.
However, it appeared in the media and the split elastica interna of
atherosclerotically transformed vessel walls.

GENE STRUCTURE

Naso et al. (1994) showed that the human versican gene contains 15 exons
spanning more than 90 kb. One of these, exon 7, is used in an
alternative splice variant. The authors sequenced the 5-prime
promoter-containing region of the gene and found that it contained
numerous binding sites for transactivators such as AP2 (107580) and Sp1
(189906). They used transient transfection studies to show that the
promoter functioned well in both mesenchymal and epithelial cells. The
authors used deletion studies to show that this 5-prime region (to
approximately -630) contains both strong enhancer and strong negative
regulatory elements.

MAPPING

The distinctness of CSPG1 (AGC1; 155760) and CSPG2 was uncertain until
both genes had been mapped. Whereas CSPG1 is located on chromosome 15,
Iozzo et al. (1992) demonstrated that the CSPG2 gene is located on
chromosome 5. They used a combination of human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids including a panel of hybrids containing partial deletions of
chromosome 5 and narrowed the assignment to 5q12-q14, with the precise
site likely to be 5q13.2, by in situ hybridization.

Using interspecific backcross analysis, Naso et al. (1995) assigned the
Cspg2 gene to mouse chromosome 13 in a region that is syntenic with 5q.

GENE FUNCTION

To determine whether TP53 (191170) gene dosage affects transcriptional
regulation of target genes, Yoon et al. (2002) performed oligonucleotide
array gene expression analysis by using human cells with wildtype p53 or
with 1 or both TP53 alleles disrupted by homologous recombination. They
identified 35 genes, including CSPG2, whose expression was significantly
correlated to the dosage of TP53. Motif search analysis revealed that
CSPG2 contains a p53 consensus binding site in its first intron. In
vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that CSPG2 is directly
transactivated by p53.

To understand how cancer cells infect the inflammatory microenvironment,
Kim et al. (2009) conducted a biochemical screen for
macrophage-activating factors secreted by metastatic carcinomas. They
demonstrated that, among the cell lines screened, Lewis lung carcinoma
(LLC) were the most potent macrophage activators leading to production
of interleukin-6 (IL6; 147620) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-alpha; 119160) through activation of the Toll-like receptor family
members TLR2 (603028) and TLR6 (605403). Both TNF-alpha and TLR2 were
found to be required for LLC metastasis. Biochemical purification of
LLC-conditioned medium led to identification of the extracellular matrix
proteoglycan versican, which is upregulated in many human tumors
including lung cancer, as a macrophage activator that acts through TLR2
and its coreceptors TLR6 and CD14 (158120). By activating TLR2:TLR6
complexes and inducing TNF-alpha secretion by myeloid cells, versican
strongly enhances LLC metastatic growth. Kim et al. (2009) concluded
that their results explained how advanced cancer cells usurp components
of the host innate immune system, including bone marrow-derived myeloid
progenitors, to generate an inflammatory microenvironment hospitable for
metastatic growth.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wagner vitreoretinopathy (WGVRP; 143200) is an autosomal dominant
vitreoretinopathy. Miyamoto et al. (2005) demonstrated a heterozygous
A-to-G transversion at the second base of the 3-prime acceptor splice
site of intron 7 of the CSPG2 gene that cosegregated with the disease in
a Japanese family (118661.0001).

In the large 5-generation Swiss family with vitreoretinopathy originally
described by Wagner (1938), Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2006) identified
a heterozygous splice site mutation in intron 8 of the VCAN gene
(118661.0002) that segregated fully with disease.

In affected members of 7 Dutch families with vitreoretinopathy,
Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for 3 splice site
mutations in intron 7 of the VCAN gene (118661.0003-118661.0005).
Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient blood samples revealed a highly
significant (p less than 0.0001) and consistent increase in the V2 and
V3 splice variants (more than 38-fold and more than 12-fold,
respectively) in all patients with intron 7 nucleotide changes, as well
as in a Chinese family with vitreoretinopathy in which a causal variant
was not identified. Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) suggested that Wagner
vitreoretinopathy is caused by an imbalance of versican isoforms,
mediated by intronic variants.

In a 4-generation French family with a severe vitreoretinal disorder
mapping to 5q13-q14, Brezin et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous
splice site mutation in intron 7 of the VCAN gene (118661.0006) that
segregated with disease and was not found 100 French controls.

In a British family and a French family with Wagner vitreoretinopathy,
Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) sequenced the VCAN gene and identified
2 heterozygous splice site mutations, in intron 8 and intron 7 of the
VCAN gene, respectively, that segregated with disease in each family
(118661.0007 and 118661.0008). The levels of splice variants V2 and V3
were significantly increased in all patient fibroblast and blood samples
from these families as well as samples from the Swiss family with
vitreoretinopathy originally described by Wagner (1938), although the
magnitude of the increase varied between tissues and mutations. There
were no statistically significant differences in V0 and V1 levels in
fibroblasts or blood between patients and controls.

In a Japanese family with Wagner syndrome (143200) in which members of 4
generations, to a total of 13 with 11 living at the time of study, were
affected, Miyamoto et al. (2005) described a heterozygous splice
acceptor site mutation in the CSPG2 gene: 4004-2 A-G. Results of RT-PCR
analysis indicated that the mutation activated a cryptic splice site
located 39 bp downstream from the authentic 3-prime splice acceptor
site.

VCAN, IVS8DS, G-A, +1

In a large 5-generation Swiss family with vitreoretinopathy (143200),
originally described by Wagner (1938), Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous transition (9265+1G-A) at the highly conserved
splice donor sequence in intron 8 of the VCAN gene, which segregated
with the phenotype in 21 affected and 26 unaffected family members and
was not found in 104 control alleles. RT-PCR analysis using patient RNA
from venous blood revealed 2 aberrant CSPG2 transcripts, 1 lacking the
entire exon 8 and the other missing only the last 21 bp of exon 8.

Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) analyzed fibroblasts from a member of
the Swiss family with vitreoretinopathy originally described by Wagner
(1938) and found a 700-fold and a 150-fold increase in versican isoforms
V2 and V3, respectively, compared to controls. In patient blood samples,
amounts of V2 and V3 were increased 48-fold and 32-fold, respectively.

.0003
WAGNER VITREORETINOPATHY
VCAN, IVS7AS, T-C, -5

In all affected individuals from 5 Dutch families with vitreoretinopathy
(143200), including 4 families diagnosed with Wagner syndrome and 1 with
erosive vitreoretinopathy, Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) identified
heterozygosity for a transition in intron 7 (4004-5T-C) of the VCAN
gene. The mutation was not found in unaffected individuals from any of
the 5 families, or in 250 Dutch controls. The 5 families shared a common
haplotype on chromosome 5q14, suggesting a founder mutation.
Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient blood samples revealed a highly
significant (p less than 0.0001) and consistent increase in the V2 and
V3 splice variants (more than 38-fold and more than 12-fold,
respectively) compared to controls.

.0004
WAGNER VITREORETINOPATHY
VCAN, IVS7AS, T-A, -5

In affected members of a Dutch family with Wagner vitreoretinopathy
(143200), Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a
transition in intron 7 (4004-5T-A) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was
not found in unaffected members of the family, or in 250 Dutch controls.
RT-PCR analysis of mutant versican transcripts showed activation of a
cryptic splice site resulting in a 39-nucleotide in-frame deletion of
exon 8 in splice variant V0. Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient
blood samples revealed a highly significant (p less than 0.0001) and
consistent increase in the V2 and V3 splice variants (more than 45-fold
and more than 13-fold, respectively) compared to controls.

.0005
WAGNER VITREORETINOPATHY
VCAN, IVS7AS, G-A, -1

In affected members of a Dutch family with Wagner vitreoretinopathy
(143200), Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a
transition in intron 7 (4004-1G-A) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was
not found in unaffected members of the family, or in 250 Dutch controls.
RT-PCR analysis of mutant versican transcripts showed activation of a
cryptic splice site resulting in a 39-nucleotide in-frame deletion of
exon 8 in splice variant V0. Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient
blood samples revealed a highly significant (p less than 0.0001) and
consistent increase in the V2 and V3 splice variants (more than 137-fold
and more than 22-fold, respectively) compared to controls.

.0006
WAGNER VITREORETINOPATHY
VCAN, IVS7AS, A-T, -2

In 10 affected members of a 4-generation French family with severe
vitreoretinopathy (1432300), Brezin et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a transversion within the highly conserved acceptor
splice site of intron 7 (4004-2A-T) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was
not found in 6 unaffected family members or in 100 French controls.
Patients in this kindred had a highly variable phenotype, including
exudative vascular abnormalities, and exhibited severe visual
impairment. RT-PCR analysis of patient lymphoblastoid cell RNA indicated
that the mutation activates a cryptic acceptor splice site within exon
8, located 39 bp downstream from the authentic 3-prime splice acceptor
site. Direct sequencing of a shortened RNA fragment showed loss of the
first 39 bp of exon 8, predicted to cause in-frame deletion of 13 amino
acid residues from the beginning of the GAG-beta domain of mature
versican. RT-PCR also indicated aberrant expression of a versican mRNA
lacking the entire exon 8.

WAGNER VITREORETINOPATHY
VCAN, IVS7, T-A, +2

In 3 affected members of a 4-generation British family with Wagner
vitreoretinopathy (143200), previously studied by Fryer et al. (1990),
Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a
transition within the conserved splice donor site of intron 8
(9265+2T-A) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was not found in 300 control
alleles. In patient blood samples, there was a 230-fold and a 143-fold
increase in versican isoforms V2 and V3, respectively, compared to
controls.

WAGNER VITREORETINOPATHY
VCAN, IVS7, G-C, -1

In 19 affected members of a 4-generation French family with Wagner
vitreoretinopathy (143200), originally reported by Zech et al. (1999),
Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a
transversion within the conserved splice acceptor site of intron 7
(4004-1G-C) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was not found in 19
unaffected family members or in 300 control alleles. In patient
fibroblasts, there was an 80-fold and a 150-fold increase in versican
isoforms V2 and V3, respectively, compared to controls, whereas in
patient blood samples, amounts of V2 and V3 increased 64-fold and
6-fold, respectively.

;;BET5, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF;;
MELANOMA UBIQUITOUS MUTATED 2; MUM2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a PAC library with a cDNA clone isolated from a melanoma
cell line, followed by 5-prime RACE, Chiari et al. (1999) obtained
TRAPPC1, which they called MUM2. The deduced 145-amino acid protein is
homologous to yeast Bet5. Northern blot analysis detected TRAPPC1 at 0.8
kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Chiari et al. (1999) noted that yeast Bet5 is implicated in vesicular
transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. They
found that wildtype TRAPPC1 could complement Bet5 function in yeast with
a disrupted Bet5 gene. They concluded that the function of TRAPPC1 is
conserved in eukaryotic cells and that it is involved in vesicular
transport of proteins.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chiari et al. (1999) determined that the TRAPPC1 gene contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Chiari et al. (1999) mapped the TRAPPC1
gene to chromosome 17p13.

120240	TITLE *120240 COLLAGEN, TYPE VI, ALPHA-2; COL6A2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The COL6A2 gene encodes the alpha-2 subunit of type VI collagen, an
ubiquitously expressed extracellular matrix protein. It is 1 of the 3
subunits comprising the full collagen VI protein (see also COL6A1,
120220 and COL6A3, 120250) (summary by Zhang et al., 2010).

CLONING

Weil et al. (1988) isolated clones corresponding to the COL6A2 gene from
a human placenta expression library. Northern blot analysis detected a
3.5-kb mRNA transcript. The molecular mass of the protein is
approximately 140 kD.

Chu et al. (1989) determined that the COL6A2 protein contains 998 amino
acids with 31% identity to COL6A1 in the N-terminal and C-terminal
globular domains, which are connected by a triple helical segment. Both
COL6A1 and COL6A2 contain small signal peptide sequences. Internal
alignment of the globular sequences showed a repetitive 200-residue
structure (15 to 23% identity) occurring 3 times (N1, C1, C2) in each
chain. Sequencing of COL6A2 cDNA clones revealed 2 variant chains with a
distinct C2 subdomain and 3-prime noncoding region. The repetitive
segments C1, C2 and, to a lesser extent, N1 showed significant identity
(15 to 18%) to the collagen-binding A domains of von Willebrand factor
(VWF; 613160). These results suggested that the globular domains of the
COL6 proteins bind to collagenous structures.

Saitta et al. (1992) found that the human COL6A2 gene uses alternative
processing to produce multiple mRNA transcripts differing in the 5-prime
untranslated region as well as in the 3-prime coding and noncoding
sequences.

GENE STRUCTURE

Saitta et al. (1992) demonstrated that the COL6A2 gene contains 30 exons
and spans 36 kb.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and FISH analysis, Weil et al. (1988) mapped the
COL6A2 gene to chromosome 21q22.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Klewer et al. (1998) studied COL6A2 gene expression in the developing
mammalian heart. The pattern of expression was identical to that of
COL6A1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 9 kindreds with the Bethlem form of autosomal dominant myopathy with
contractures (158810), Jobsis et al. (1996) demonstrated genetic linkage
to the COL6A1-COL6A2 cluster on 21q22.3. By sequence analysis in 4
families, Jobsis et al. (1996) identified a mutation in COL6A1 in 1
kindred and a mutation in COL6A2 in 2 others. Both mutations disrupted
the Gly-X-Y motif of the triple helical domain by substitution of gly
for either val or ser. Analogous to the putative perturbation of the
anchoring function of the dystrophin-associated complex in congenital
muscular dystrophy with mutations in the alpha-2-subunit of laminin
(156225), the observation suggested a similar mechanism in Bethlem
myopathy.

Ullrich scleroatonic muscular dystrophy, also known as Ullrich
congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD; 254090), shares some clinical
features with Bethlem myopathy, such as joint contractures, but displays
a more severe course. Vanegas et al. (2001) demonstrated recessive
mutations in the COL6A2 gene (see 120240.0002) leading to UCMD.

Lampe et al. (2005) developed a method for rapid direct sequence
analysis of all 107 coding exons of the COL6 genes (COL6A1, COL6A2,
COL6A3; 120250) using single condition amplification/internal primer
(SCAIP) sequencing. They sequenced all 3 COL6 genes from genomic DNA in
79 patients with UCMD or Bethlem myopathy, and found putative mutations
in 1 of the COL6 genes in 62% of patients. Some patients showed changes
in more than one of the COL6 genes, and some UCMD patients appeared to
have dominant rather than recessive disease. Lampe et al. (2005)
concluded that these findings may explain some or all of the cases of
UCMD that are unlinked to the COL6 gene under a recessive model.

In 2 unrelated patients with Bethlem myopathy, Baker et al. (2007)
identified 2 different heterozygous mutations in the COL6A2 gene
(120240.0009; 120240.0010). In vitro studies indicated defective
collagen VI synthesis and secretion.

In 2 sibs with autosomal recessive myosclerosis (255600), Merlini et al.
(2008) identified a homozygous truncating mutation in the COL6A2 gene
(120240.0011).

Nadeau et al. (2009) identified a homozygous COL6A2 mutation (C777R;
120240.0012) in 3 patients with autosomal recessive UCMD. Two additional
patients had 2 different heterozygous COL6A2 mutations (see, e.g.,
G283R, 120240.0013), consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.
Another patient was compound heterozygous for a mutation in the COL6A1
gene (G281R; 120220.0014) and a mutation in the COL6A2 gene (R498H;
120240.0014), consistent with digenic inheritance.

- Role of COL6A2 in Atrioventricular Septal Defect

Ackerman et al. (2012) used a candidate gene approach among individuals
with Down syndrome and complete atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD)
(141 cases) and Down syndrome with no congenital heart defect (141
controls) to determine whether rare genetic variants in genes involved
in atrioventricular valvuloseptal morphogenesis contribute to AVSD in
this sensitized population. Ackerman et al. (2012) found a significant
excess (p less than 0.0001) of variants predicted to be deleterious in
cases compared to controls. At the most stringent level of filtering,
they found potentially damaging variants in nearly 20% of cases but in
fewer than 3% of controls. The variants with the highest probability of
being damaging in cases only were found in 6 genes: COL6A1, COL6A2,
CRELD1 (607170) (already identified as a cause of AVSD; see 606217),
FBLN2 (135821), FRZB (605083), and GATA5 (611496). Several of the
case-specific variants were recurrent in unrelated individuals,
occurring in 10% of cases studied. No variants with an equal probability
of being damaging were found in controls, demonstrating a highly
specific association with AVSD. Of note, all of these genes are in the
VEGFA (192240) pathway, suggesting to Ackerman et al. (2012) that rare
variants in this pathway might contribute to the genetic underpinnings
of AVSD in humans.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Gualandi et al. (2009) reported 2 unrelated patients with Bethlem
myopathy who were each compound heterozygous for a truncating and a
missense mutation in the COL6A2 gene (Q819X, 120240.0011 and
R830Q/R843W, 120240.0017; R366X, 120240.0018 and D871N; 120240.0019,
respectively). Both patients remained ambulatory as adults, and muscle
biopsies and studies of fibroblasts showed variable degrees of aberrant
collagen VI microfilament formation. Gualandi et al. (2009) noted that
autosomal recessive inheritance had not been reported in Bethlem
myopathy and suggested that collagen VI-related myopathies comprise a
spectrum of conditions with variable severity. In addition, the findings
did not support pure haploinsufficiency as a causative mechanism for
Bethlem myopathy, and suggested that some previously reported patients
may harbor a second missed mutation. The genotype findings in these
patients had important implications for genetic counseling.

BETHLEM MYOPATHY
COL6A2, GLY250SER

In 2 kindreds with Bethlem myopathy (158810), Jobsis et al. (1996)
demonstrated that affected members had a heterozygous missense mutation
(898G-A) resulting in a G250S amino acid substitution in the triple
helical region.

ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, 1-BP INS, 1151C

In an Italian family, Vanegas et al. (2001) found that a son with
Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (254090) had a homozygous
insertion of a C leading to a premature termination codon in the triple
helical domain of COL6A2 mRNA. Both healthy consanguineous parents were
carriers. The insertion of the C was in a stretch of 5 cytosines between
nucleotides 1147 and 1151 of the COL6A2 cDNA, causing a slippage of the
reading frame with a premature termination codon at nucleotides
1347-1349. The affected patient in this family showed reduced fetal
movements. At birth he was unusually long (55 cm), showed multiple joint
contractures of his knees and elbows, a kyphotic contracture of the
spine, a left hip dislocation, bilateral congenital convex pes valgus,
long and slender fingers and toes with adducted thumbs, ogival palate,
micrognathia, and a short neck with torticollis. He also showed marked
bilateral distal hyperlaxity of fingers, toes, calcanei, and wrists. The
child walked at the age of 13 months, but generalized muscle weakness
persisted thereafter, and progressive scoliosis and respiratory failure
developed. He underwent tracheostomy and nocturnal positive pressure
mechanical ventilation at the age of 8 years, with signs of
diaphragmatic insufficiency. At the age of 11 years, he was still
ambulant and had normal intelligence.

In fibroblasts from the patient reported by Vanegas et al. (2001), Zhang
et al. (2002) showed almost complete absence of COL6A2 mRNA by Northern
blot analysis, suggesting that the mutation led to nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay. There was complete absence of secreted COL6A2 protein in the
medium of the patient's cells, suggesting that the mutation in the
triple helical domain prevented microfibrillar assembly and secretion.
Although both parents showed decreased levels of COL6A2 mRNA, long-term
collagen VI deposition was essentially normal.

.0003
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, IVS17, A-G, -2

In an Italian family, Vanegas et al. (2001) found that 2 brothers with
Ullrich scleroatonic muscular dystrophy (254090) had a splice acceptor
site mutation in the COL6A2 gene. Deletion of 28 nucleotides was caused
by an A-to-G substitution at nucleotide -2 of intron 17, causing
activation of a cryptic acceptor site within exon 18. The normal parents
were unrelated. Severe contractures of elbows and knees, rigidity of the
spine, ogival (gothic) palate, and hypotonia were present. In 1 brother
there was distal hyperlaxity and marked weakness of head flexors but
almost complete disappearance of limb joint contractures at the age of 2
years. In the brothers, this mutation was found in compound
heterozygosity with a splice site mutation in intron 23 (120240.0004).
The first mutation was present in the healthy mother, whereas the second
mutation was carried by the healthy father. In another Italian family,
Vanegas et al. (2001) found the same 28-bp deletion but did not find the
mutation in the other allele. This mutation occurred de novo in the
patient.

In fibroblasts from 1 of the patients reported by Vanegas et al. (2001)
who was a compound heterozygote for mutations in the COL6A2 gene, Zhang
et al. (2002) showed decreased levels of COL6A2 mRNA by Northern blot
analysis, suggesting that the mutations led to nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay. Low levels of COL6A2 protein were detected in the medium of the
patient's cells, suggesting that the mutations, which occurred at the
distal part of the triple helical domain, allowed secretion of a small
amount of mutant collagen VI protein. Further analysis showed that the
truncated proteins were able to form triple helical monomers, but unable
to assemble into dimers and tetramers for the completed collagen VI
protein. Zhang et al. (2002) noted that the IVS23 mutation (120240.0004)
retains the triple helical domain and thus can assemble into monomers,
but has a shorter C-terminal globular domain which prevents further
assembly into higher ordered structures. Although both parents showed
decreased levels of COL6A2 mRNA, long-term collagen VI deposition was
essentially normal.

COL6A2, IVS23, G-A, -1

Vanegas et al. (2001) described 2 brothers with Ullrich scleroatonic
muscular dystrophy (254090) who were compound heterozygotes for 2 splice
site mutations in the COL6A2 gene, one in intron 17 (120240.0003) and
the other a G-to-A substitution at nucleotide -1 in intron 23.

BETHLEM MYOPATHY
COL6A2, ASP620ASN

In a Caucasian family from Mississippi and North Carolina, Scacheri et
al. (2002) found 9 members with an autosomal dominant limb-girdle
muscular dystrophy phenotype. A causative missense mutation, asp620 to
asn (D620N), was present in heterozygous state. This mutation did not
overtly affect the expression of proteins of the extracellular matrix
(ECM), but did alter the expression of laminin beta-1 (150240) in the
basement membrane of muscle fibers. Type VI collagen was thought to
anchor the basal lamina to the extracellular matrix by interacting with
collagen type IV, which in turn was thought to bind laminin beta-1 (Kuo
et al., 1997). Scacheri et al. (2002) suggested that their studies widen
the clinical spectrum of Bethlem myopathy (158810) and indicated that
autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy should be studied for
possible collagen VI etiology.

.0006
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, 26-BP DEL, NT731

In a patient with Ullrich disease (254090), Higuchi et al. (2001)
identified a homozygous 26-bp deletion (nucleotides 731-756) in exon 14
of the COL6A2 gene, causing a frameshift and premature termination
codon, and resulting in a truncated collagen VI alpha-2 chain. Collagen
VI expression was absent from the patient's skeletal muscle and skin
samples.

.0007
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, IVS12AS, A-G, -10

In a patient with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (254090),
Lucarini et al. (2005) identified a homozygous A-to-G transition in
intron 12 of the COL6A2 gene, resulting in deletion of exon 13, which
removed 21 amino acids from the N terminus of the triple helical domain.
The misaligned N-terminal region was predicted to interfere with the
assembly of collagen VI microfibrils. The intron mutation activated
numerous cryptic acceptor sites, generating both normal and exon
13-deleted COL6A2 mRNA as well as multiple transcripts containing
frameshifts that were degraded through nonsense-mediated decay.

.0008
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
COL6A2, 1.3-KB DEL

In a patient with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (254090), Baker
et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for a 1,332-bp deletion of the
COL6A2 gene, which included part of intron 5, all of exon 6 and intron
6, and part of exon 7 and was predicted to result in loss of 27 amino
acids in the triple helical region. The patient's mother was a mosaic
carrier of the deletion.

.0009
BETHLEM MYOPATHY
COL6A2, IVS10AS, A-G, -2

In a 40-year-old man with Bethlem myopathy (158810), Baker et al. (2007)
identified a heterozygous A-to-G transition in intron 10 of the COL6A2
gene, resulting in the skipping of exon 11. Exon 11 codes for the only
cysteine residue in the triple helical domain of the protein, which is
predicted to form a disulfide bond critical for dimerization. This would
result in decreased assembly of the collagen VI protein. Further
evidence indicated nonsense-mediated decay of an mRNA with a premature
stop codon, and reduced secretion of structurally abnormal collagen. The
patient had proximal muscle weakness, decreased motor capacity, joint
contractures, and dystrophic features on muscle biopsy.

BETHLEM MYOPATHY
COL6A2, PRO932LEU

In a 42-year-old Australian man with Bethlem myopathy (158810), Baker et
al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 2795C-T transition in exon 28 of
the COL6A2 gene, resulting in a pro932-to-leu (P932L) substitution in
the globular C2 A-domain. Three first cousins and a niece were affected
and also carried the mutation. The proband had proximal muscle weakness
and joint contractures. Further studies indicated that the mutant P932L
resulted in reduced intracellular collagen VI assembly and secretion.

.0011
MYOSCLEROSIS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
BETHLEM MYOPATHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, GLN819TER

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with autosomal recessive
myosclerosis (255600), Merlini et al. (2008) identified a homozygous
2537C-T transition in exon 27 in the COL6A2 gene, resulting in a
gln819-to-ter (Q819X) substitution in the C1 domain. RT-PCR studies
showed that the mutation did not result in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay;
the translated truncated protein lacked the C2 domain. Studies in
patient fibroblasts showed decreased COL6A2 transcripts and decreased
amounts of collagen VI deposited in the extracellular matrix. The
secreted collagen VI microfibrils were abnormally organized and did not
assemble properly into tetramers. The heterozygous parents were
unaffected, suggesting that the mutation is not pathogenic in the
heterozygous state.

Gualandi et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for the Q819X
mutation and a complex missense allele (R830Q/R843W; 120240.0017) in a
25-year-old woman with Bethlem myopathy (158800). Although this genotype
suggested autosomal recessive inheritance, the R819X mutation escaped
nonsense-mediated decay and was thought not to be pathogenic in the
heterozygous state, based on the report of Merlini et al. (2008).
However, the fact that the woman reported by Gualandi et al. (2009)
carried COL6A2 mutations on both alleles had implications for genetic
counseling.

ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, CYS777ARG

In 3 patients with UCMD (254090), including 2 cousins, Nadeau et al.
(2009) identified a homozygous 2329T-C transition in exon 26 of the
COL6A2 gene, resulting in a cys777-to-arg (C777R) substitution. Onset
ranged from birth to 2 years. One child had congenital hip dislocation.
All had proximal muscle weakness and learned to walk independently at
about 1 year of age, but became wheelchair-bound at ages 6.8, 9, and
11.5 years, respectively. Other features included spinal rigidity,
scoliosis, and kyphosis. All also required nocturnal ventilation, and 1
needed gastrostomy for chewing difficulties. Only 1 had follicular
hyperkeratosis.

COL6A2, GLY283ARG

In a 20-year-old patient with UCMD (254090), Nadeau et al. (2009)
identified a heterozygous 847G-A transition in exon 6 of the COL6A2
gene, resulting in a gly283-to-arg (G283R) substitution. The patient had
onset at birth with hypotonia, contractures, scoliosis, and delayed
motor development. Walking with support was achieved at age 3.3 years,
but the patient became wheelchair-bound at age 10. Nocturnal ventilation
was also required. Skin changes included follicular hyperkeratosis and
keloid formation.

ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, DIGENIC, COL6A1/COL6A2
COL6A2, ARG498HIS

In a 25-year-old patient with UCMD (254090), Nadeau et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in 2 different genes:
a 1493G-A transition in exon 18 of the COL6A2 gene, resulting in an
arg498-to-his (R498H) substitution, and a substitution in the COL6A1
gene (G281R; 120220.0014). The findings were consistent with digenic
inheritance. The patient had onset at age 1.5 years of delayed motor
development with proximal muscle weakness. Independent walking was
achieved, but the patient became wheelchair-bound at age 19. Spinal
rigidity, scoliosis, and contractures were also present, as well as
follicular hyperkeratosis and a requirement for nocturnal ventilation.

.0015
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, GLU624LYS

In a Brazilian girl with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (254090),
Zhang et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 1870G-A transition in the
COL6A2 gene, resulting in a glu624-to-lys (E624K) substitution in the C1
globular subdomain. Sequence alignment and molecular modeling indicated
that the mutation occurred in a consensus metal ion-dependent adhesion
site (MIDAS). Patient fibroblasts deposited abundant collagen VI
microfibrils that were thick and abnormally knotty. HEK293 cells
transfected with the mutation assembled low levels of short collagen VI
microfibrils. The E624K mutation did not affect collagen VI formation
and assembly and did not exert a dominant-negative effect, as
heterozygous family members were unaffected. However, the E624K-mutant
chain was less efficient in supporting microfibrillar assembly than
wildtype.

.0016
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, ARG876SER

In a young man, born of consanguineous Filipino parents, with Ullrich
congenital muscular dystrophy (254090), Zhang et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 2626C-A transversion in the COL6A2 gene, resulting in an
arg876-to-ser (R876S) substitution in the beta-2 strand of the C2
globular subdomain. Patient fibroblasts produced almost no collagen VI
microfibrils in the extracellular matrix. The minute amounts of COL6A2
that were produced consisted of the C2a splice variant with a shorter
alternative C2 subdomain not affected by the missense mutation. The C2a
splice variant COL6A2 was not assembled into a triple-helical collagen
VI molecule. HEK293 cells transfected with the R876S mutation showed
intracellular retention of the mutant chain and were unable to
synthesize normal collagen VI microfibrils. However, the patient showed
a slightly less severe phenotype than another affected patient with a
different mutation (see 120240.0015), suggesting that the low levels of
COL6A2 with alternatively spliced C2a may have functionally compensated
for loss of normal COL6A2.

BETHLEM MYOPATHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, ARG830GLN AND ARG843TRP

In a 25-year-old woman with Bethlem myopathy (158810), Gualandi et al.
(2009) identified compound heterozygosity for variations in the COL6A2
gene. The maternal allele carried a 2571G-A and a 2609C-T transition,
both in exon 28, resulting in an arg830-t-gln (R830Q) and an
arg843-to-trp (R843W) substitution, respectively, in the C2 domain. Both
mutations affected highly conserved residues. The paternal allele
carried a Q819X (120240.0011) substitution. The patient had onset of
progressive proximal muscle weakness at age 2 years. During the course
of the disorder, she developed prominent joint contractures and
decreased forced vital capacity (65% of predicted), but retained
independent ambulation. Muscle biopsy showed a myopathic pattern and
fibrosis with mildly decreased collagen VI staining. Studies of
fibroblasts showed absence of collagen VI tetramer formation, but
electron microscopy showed correct filamentous and interconnected
collagen VI microfilaments. Gualandi et al. (2009) concluded that this
woman showed rare autosomal recessive inheritance of Bethlem myopathy
based on her genotype. However, the authors noted that the R819X
mutation escaped nonsense-mediated decay and was thought not to be
pathogenic in the heterozygous state, based on the report of Merlini et
al. (2008). The fact that the woman reported by Gualandi et al. (2009)
carried COL6A2 mutations on both alleles had implications for genetic
counseling.

BETHLEM MYOPATHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, ARG366TER

In a 47-year-old man with Bethlem myopathy (158810), Gualandi et al.
(2009) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the COL6A2 gene: a
1178C-T transition in exon 12, resulting in an arg366-to-ter (R366X)
substitution, and a de novo 2693G-A transition in exon 28, resulting in
an asp871-to-asn (D871N; 120240.0019) substitution in a conserved region
of the C2 domain. The nonsense mutation was demonstrated to undergo
nonsense-mediated decay. The patient's unaffected mother carried the
heterozygous R377X mutation, suggesting that it is not pathogenic in the
heterozygous state. The patient was born with talipes equinovarus and
had Achilles contractures in childhood. He had limb-girdle weakness with
joint contractures and reduced vital capacity (64% of predicted). At age
47, he could walk with aid, but could no longer rise from the floor.
Muscle biopsy showed dystrophic features and decreased collagen VI.
Studies of fibroblasts showed severely decreased levels of all forms of
collagen VI, and electron microscopy showed irregular collagen VI
microfilaments with absence of normal network structure. Gualandi et al.
(2009) concluded that this patient had autosomal recessive Bethlem
myopathy because of the genotype and his ability to remain ambulatory.
The authors stated that the combination of a missense and a nonsense
mutation in the COL6A2 gene had not previously been reported, yielding
implications for genetic counseling.

ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A2, 6-BP DEL, 1855

In a girl with UCMD (254090), Tooley et al. (2010) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the COL6A2 gene: a 6-bp deletion in
exon 25 (1855_1860del6) causing an in-frame deletion of 2 amino acids in
the N-terminal C1 VWA domain (V619_I620del2), and a G-to-T transversion
in intron 23 (1771-1G-T; 120240.0021), resulting in the skipping of exon
24, a frameshift, and premature termination. Each mutation was inherited
from an unaffected parent. Northern blot analysis of patient fibroblasts
showed that the intron 23 mutation resulted in nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay. Patient fibroblasts showed reduced, but present, collagen VI
production, indicating that the COL6A1 and COL6A3 chains could associate
with mutant COL6A2, forming monomers, dimers, and tetramers. However,
kinetic studies showed that the mutation delayed the assembly and
secretion of collagen VI compared to controls, and several additional
approaches showed that the mutation prevented the association of
secreted tetramers into collagen VI microfibrils. Recombinant C1 domains
containing the mutation were insoluble and retained intracellularly as
disulfide-bonded aggregates, consistent with misfolding. The findings
indicated that a correctly folded COL6A2 C1 domain is important for
microfibril assembly.

300083	TITLE *300083 PROTEIN KINASE, X-LINKED; PRKX
;;PROTEIN KINASE PKX1; PKX1
DESCRIPTION Klink et al. (1995) isolated a gene designated PKX1 by virtue of its
position within the candidate region for chondrodysplasia punctata in
Xp22.3. PKX1 appeared to encode a novel type of protein kinase that is
related to the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinases and
has striking homology to the DC2 protein kinase of Drosophila
melanogaster. PKX1 is part of a family of at least 4 genes or
pseudogenes, of which 3 map to the human sex chromosomes. In contrast to
all other genes from the X-specific region of Xp22.3, PKX1 has a homolog
on Yp (PRKY; 400008) rather than Yq. This suggests that the single
pericentric inversion event hypothesized to have occurred during primate
evolution is not sufficient to explain the present X/Y homology pattern
of Xp22.3. Klink et al. (1995) found that a high proportion of the
chromosomal rearrangements in Xp22.3 or Yp occurred within the PKX1
locus. This suggests that the PKX1 gene, besides harboring a previously
described hotspot for illegitimate Xp/Yp recombination, contains
additional sequences which predispose the X chromosome to breakage
events.

PRKX (formerly PKX1) is a novel serine/threonine subtype of protein
kinase that appears to encode a protein related to the catalytic subunit
of the cAMP-dependent protein kinases which are key players in the
cellular responses to the second messenger cAMP. Klink et al. (1995)
found that somatic cell hybrid analysis of PRKX under high stringency
conditions revealed at least 3 further loci closely related to this gene
in the human, constituting a small subfamily. Schiebel et al. (1997)
used FISH analysis to map the Y homolog of PRKX (PRKY) to Yp11.2 in
close proximity to AMELY (410000); the autosomal copy, a pseudogene
(PRKXP1), to 15q26; and a further X-linked pseudogene (PRKXP2) to
Xq12-q13.

Renal expression of the PRKX gene is developmentally regulated and
restricted to the ureteric bud epithelium of the fetal metanephric
kidney. Li et al. (2002) found aberrant adult kidney expression of PRKX
in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD1; 601313). PRKX
kinase expression markedly activated migration of cultured renal
epithelial cells in the presence of cAMP; this effect was blocked by
cell treatment with the PKA inhibitor H89 and was not observed in
PKA-transfected cells. These and other results suggested that the PRKX
kinase may regulate epithelial morphogenesis during mammalian kidney
development.

102680	TITLE *102680 ADDUCIN 1; ADD1
;;ADDUCIN, ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Adducin is a 200-kD heterodimeric protein associated with the
erythrocyte membrane skeleton, which binds to Ca(2+)/calmodulin (see
114180), promotes binding of spectrin to actin, and is a substrate for
protein kinases C and A (Gardner and Bennett, 1986; Bennett et al.,
1988). The name adducin comes from the Latin 'adducere,' meaning 'to
bring together.'

CLONING

Adducin was first purified from human erythrocytes by Gardner and
Bennett (1986) and subsequently isolated from bovine brain membranes
(Bennett et al., 1988).

Joshi and Bennett (1990) investigated the structure and function of the
separate domains of alpha adducin. Joshi et al. (1991) isolated
reticulocyte cDNAs for alpha- and beta- (ADD2; 102681) adducin. The
deduced alpha-adducin protein contains 737 amino acids and shares
approximately 49% sequence identity with beta adducin, suggesting
evolution by gene duplication. Each adducin subunit has 3 distinct
domains: a 39-kD N-terminal globular protease-resistant domain,
connected by a 9-kD domain to a 33-kD C-terminal protease-sensitive tail
comprised almost entirely by hydrophilic amino acids. The head domains
of both alpha- and beta-adducin have limited sequence similarity with
the N-terminal actin-binding motif present in members of the spectrin
superfamily and actin gelation proteins. The C termini of both proteins
contain an identical 22-amino acid sequence showing similarity to the
MARCKS protein (177061). Northern blot analysis of rat tissues, K562
erythroleukemia cells, and reticulocytes demonstrated ubiquitous
expression of alpha adducin.

Goldberg et al. (1992) identified a 4-kb alpha-adducin transcript that
was abundantly expressed in the caudate nucleus, the site of major
neuronal loss in Huntington disease (HD; 143100). No sequence
alterations specific to HD were discovered in sequencing the brain
alpha-adducin cDNA from 2 HD patients and an age-matched control. Brain
cDNA from both patients and controls showed 2 alternately spliced brain
exons not previously described in erythrocyte cDNA.

In a comprehensive assay of gene expression, Gilligan et al. (1999)
showed the ubiquitous expression of alpha- and gamma-adducin (ADD3;
601568), in contrast to the restricted expression of beta-adducin.
Beta-adducin was expressed at high levels in brain and hematopoietic
tissues (bone marrow in humans, spleen in mice).

See Gilligan and Bennett (1993) for a review of adducin and the other
components of the junctional complex of the cell membrane skeleton.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Joshi et al. (1991) provisionally
assigned the ADD1 gene to chromosome 4 and the ADD2 gene to chromosome
2. Both alpha- and beta-adducin show alternative splicing; thus, there
may be several different heterodimeric or homodimeric forms of adducin,
each with a different functional specificity.

Using the technique of 'exon trapping' devised by Buckler et al. (1991),
Taylor et al. (1992) identified exons corresponding to the alpha subunit
of adducin within the 4p16.3 region where Huntington disease appeared to
be located. They mapped the ADD1 gene immediately telomeric to D4S95.

Goldberg et al. (1992) reported the isolation and cloning of cDNA for
the brain alpha-adducin gene, which they found to be located within 20
kb of D4S95.

Nasir et al. (1994) used an interspecific backcross to map the mouse
Add1 gene to chromosome 5, within the region of syntenic homology with
the short arm of human chromosome 4. Grosson et al. (1994) also mapped
the mouse Add1 gene to chromosome 5 in a continuous linkage group that
included the Huntington disease homolog.

GENE FUNCTION

Kuhlman et al. (1996) found that purified human erythrocyte adducin
completely blocked elongation and depolymerization at the fast-growing
barbed ends of actin filaments in vitro, thus functioning as a barbed
end capping protein. This barbed end capping activity required the
intact adducin molecule and was downregulated by calmodulin in the
presence of calcium. Kuhlman et al. (1996) concluded that adducin
restricts actin filament length in erythrocytes.

To investigate the molecular involvement of alpha-adducin in controlling
Na/K pump activity, Torielli et al. (2008) transfected wildtype or
mutated rat and human ADD1 into several renal cell lines and
demonstrated that the rat and human mutated forms increased Na/K pump
activity and the number of pump units; both variants
coimmunoprecipitated with the Na/K pump. The increased pump activity was
not due to changes in its basolateral location, but to an alteration of
Na/K pump residential time on the plasma membrane. Both the rat and
human mutated variants reduced constitutive Na/K pump endocytosis and
similarly affected transferrin receptor (190010) trafficking and
fluid-phase endocytosis. Alpha-adducin was also detected in clathrin
(see 118955)-coated vesicles and coimmunoprecipitated with clathrin.
Torielli et al. (2008) suggested that adducin, in addition to having
modulatory effects on actin cytoskeleton dynamics, might play a direct
role in clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and that the constitutive
reduction of Na/K pump endocytic rate induced by mutated adducin
variants might be relevant in sodium-dependent hypertension (see
145500).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a case-control study involving 190 patients with primary hypertension
and 126 controls, Casari et al. (1995) found an association between
essential hypertension (see 145500) and allelic markers near the
alpha-adducin locus.

Cusi et al. (1997) found significant linkage of the alpha-adducin locus
to essential hypertension and greater sensitivity to changes in sodium
balance among patients with a particular ADD1 allele, trp460
(102680.0001), suggesting that alpha adducin is associated with a
salt-sensitive form of essential hypertension.

Manunta et al. (1998) analyzed the pressure-natriuresis relationship in
108 hypertensive individuals and found that patients with a G/W or W/W
ADD1 genotype showed lower plasma renin activity and fractional
excretion of sodium as well as reduced slope of the pressure-natriuresis
relationship after sodium depletion or sodium loading compared to G/G
patients. These findings supported the hypothesis that individuals with
at least 1 ADD1 460W allele have increased renal tubular sodium
reabsorption.

Using endogenous lithium and uric acid as markers of proximal tubular
sodium reabsorption, Manunta et al. (1999) investigated the relationship
between renal sodium handling and ADD1 polymorphism in untreated
hypertensive patients and found that adducin genotype was significantly
and directly related to the fractional excretion of lithium. Manunta et
al. (1999) concluded that ADD1 represents a 'renal hypertensive gene'
that modulates the capacity of tubular epithelial cells to transport
sodium and thus affects blood pressure levels.

Allayee et al. (2001) performed a genomewide scan for blood pressure in
18 Dutch families exhibiting the common lipid disorder familial combined
hyperlipidemia (144250). They found a locus on chromosome 4 that
exhibited a significant lod score of 3.9 for systolic blood pressure. In
addition, this locus appeared to influence plasma free fatty acid levels
(lod = 2.4). After adjustment for age and gender, the lod score for
systolic blood pressure increased to 4.6, whereas the lod score for free
fatty acid levels did not change. Allayee et al. (2001) tested for an
association between 2 intragenic ADD1 polymorphisms and systolic blood
pressure in this sample and found none.

Lanzani et al. (2005) examined the association between polymorphisms in
the ADD1, ADD2, and ADD3 genes (G460W, C1797T, and IVS11+386A-G,
respectively) and ambulatory blood pressure and plasma levels of renin
activity and endogenous ouabain in 512 newly discovered and
never-treated hypertensive patients. Relative to carriers of the
wildtype (G/G) ADD1 gene, carriers of the mutant 460W allele had higher
blood pressure and lower plasma renin activity and endogenous ouabain
levels. Polymorphisms in the ADD2 and ADD3 genes taken alone were not
associated with these variables, but the blood pressure difference
between the 2 ADD1 genotypes was greatest in carriers of the ADD3 G
allele (increased by approximately 8 mm Hg; p = 0.020 to 0.006,
depending on the genetic model applied). The authors suggested that
there were epistatic effects between the ADD1 and ADD3 loci affecting
variation in blood pressure.

ANIMAL MODEL

The Milan hypertensive strain of rats develops a genetic form of renal
hypertension that, when compared to its normotensive control, shows
renal dysfunction similar to that of a subset of human patients with
primary hypertension. Bianchi et al. (1994) showed that 1 point mutation
in each of the 2 genes coding for adducin is associated with blood
pressure level in this strain of rats. The hypertensive and normal rats
differed, respectively, by the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine at
position 316 of the alpha subunit; at the beta-adducin locus, the
hypertensive strain was always homozygous for arginine at position 529,
while the normal strain showed either arginine or glutamine in that
position. The arg/gln heterozygotes showed lower blood pressure than any
of the homozygotes. In vitro phosphorylation studies suggested that both
of these amino acid substitutions occurred within protein kinase
recognition sites. Analysis of an F2 generation demonstrated that Y
(tyrosine) alleles segregated with a significant increment in blood
pressure. This effect was modulated by the presence of the R (arginine)
allele of the beta subunit. Bianchi et al. (1994) stated that, taken
together, these findings strongly supported a role for adducin
polymorphisms in causing variation of blood pressure in the Milan strain
of rats. In the rat, the beta- and alpha-adducin genes were said to be
located on chromosomes 4 and 14, respectively.

Tripodi et al. (1996) studied the effects of the Milan hypertensive rat
316Y and 529R mutations in Add1 and Add2, respectively, on actin
polymerization and bundling in a cell-free system and found that
double-mutated adducin exerted only a slight inhibitory effect with a
much higher final extent of polymerization compared to wildtype. Adducin
heterodimer mutated only in the beta subunit behaved as normal adducin,
whereas adducin heterodimer mutated only in the alpha subunit exhibited
an intermediate phenotype, consistent with the associated levels of
blood pressure previously described by Bianchi et al. (1994). Studies of
the actin cytoskeleton in transfected rat kidney epithelial cell lines
showed that cells overexpressing the mutated alpha-adducin chain
exhibited larger microfilament bundles and larger focal contacts with
patchy aggregates of alpha-v integrin (193210), compared to cells
overexpressing wildtype adducin, in which the microfilament bundles were
organized in a much looser texture and alpha-v integrin was present in a
diffuse punctate pattern with small focal contacts. The surface
expression of the Na-K pump alpha subunit was considerably increased in
cells overexpressing the mutated alpha-adducin chain, and Na-K pump
activity at V(max) was increased with respect to normal transfected
lines and untransfected cells. Tripodi et al. (1996) suggested that
adducin has a role in the constitutive capacity of the renal epithelia
both to transport ions and to expose adhesion molecules.

Efendiev et al. (2004) studied Milan rats carrying the hypertensive
adducin phenotype and observed higher renal tubule Na/K-ATPase activity
and found that their Na/K-ATPase molecules did not undergo endocytosis
in response to dopamine like those of normotensive rats. In the
hypertensive rats, dopamine failed to promote the interaction between
adaptins (see 601026) and the Na/K-ATPase, required for endocytosis,
because of adaptin-mu-2 subunit (602296) hyperphosphorylation.
Expression of the hypertensive rat or human variant of ADD1 into normal
renal epithelial cells recreated the hypertensive phenotype with higher
Na/K-ATPase activity, mu-2-subunit hyperphosphorylation, and impaired
Na/K-ATPase endocytosis. The authors concluded that increased renal
Na/K-ATPase activity and altered sodium reabsorption in certain forms of
hypertension could be attributed to a mutant form of adducin that
impairs the dynamic regulation of renal Na/K-ATPase endocytosis in
response to natriuretic signals.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPERTENSION, SALT-SENSITIVE ESSENTIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
ADD1, GLY460TRP

Cusi et al. (1997) found a significant association between a
gly460-to-trp polymorphism (G460W) in the ADD1 gene and salt sensitivity
in patients with essential hypertension (see 145500). Patients with the
W460 allele showed greater sensitivity to changes in sodium balance, and
heterozygous hypertensive patients (G/W) showed a greater fall in mean
arterial pressure in response to 2 months' treatment with
hydrochlorothiazide, than did wildtype homozygous (G/G) hypertensive
patients. In controls in an Italian cohort, the G460 allele had a
frequency of 86.4% and the W460 allele 13.6%.

Manunta et al. (1998) analyzed the pressure-natriuresis relationship in
108 hypertensive individuals, 80 of whom were wildtype homozygous (G/G),
26 G/W heterozygous, and 2 W/W homozygous. At baseline, the G/W and W/W
patients showed lower plasma renin activity and fractional excretion of
sodium; these patients also had reduced slope of the
pressure-natriuresis relationship after sodium depletion or sodium
loading compared to G/G patients. These findings supported the
hypothesis that individuals with at least 1 ADD1 460W allele have
increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption.

Using endogenous lithium and uric acid as markers of proximal tubular
sodium reabsorption, Manunta et al. (1999) investigated the relationship
between renal sodium handling and ADD1 polymorphism in 54 untreated
hypertensive patients, 29 with the G/G genotype and 25 with the G/W
genotype. Fractional excretions of lithium and uric acid were
significantly decreased in G/W patients compared to G/G patients;
multiple regression analysis showed that adducin genotype was
significantly and directly related to the fractional excretion of
lithium. Manunta et al. (1999) concluded that ADD1 represents a 'renal
hypertensive gene' that modulates the capacity of tubular epithelial
cells to transport sodium and thus affects blood pressure levels.

600744	TITLE *600744 T-CELL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR EB; TFEB
;;TCFEB
TFEB/ALPHA FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix zipper (bHLH-ZIP)
family contain a basic domain, used for DNA binding, and HLH and ZIP
domains, both used for oligomerization. TFEB was isolated from a human
B-cell cDNA library using a binding sequence from the adenovirus major
late promoter (Carr and Sharp, 1990).

MAPPING

By interspecific backcross analysis, Steingrimsson et al. (1995) mapped
the Tcfeb gene in the mouse to chromosome 17 in a region of homology to
human 6p21, which can be presumed to be the location of the human
homolog.

CYTOGENETICS

Argani et al. (2001) identified a class of renal tumors containing a
translocation t(6;11)(p21.1;q12). Whereas these tumors exhibited
epitheloid morphology suggestive of renal carcinoma, they were
distinctive in their nonimmunoreactivity for epithelial markers
(cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen) and positive immunoreactivity
for melanocytic markers. Davis et al. (2003) reported that TFEB is
targeted by this translocation in both of 2 tumors examined. TFEB fuses
with the Alpha gene at 11q13, an intronless gene that does not
contribute coding sequence to the fusion product. In the 2 primary
tumors the Alpha gene rearranged with the first intron of TFEB, just
upstream of TFEB's initiation ATG, preserving the entire TFEB coding
sequence. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the involvement
of both TFEB and Alpha in this translocation. Although the Alpha
promoter drives expression of this fusion gene, the Alpha gene does not
contribute to the ORF.

Whereas TFE3 (314310) is typically fused to partner proteins in subsets
of renal tumors, Davis et al. (2003) found that wildtype, unfused TFE3
stimulates clonogenic growth in a cell-based assay, suggesting that
dysregulated expression, rather than altered function of TFEB or TFE3
fusions, may confer neoplastic properties, a mechanism reminiscent of
MYC (190080) activation by promoter substitution in Burkitt lymphoma.
Alpha-TFEB is thus identified as a fusion gene in a subset of renal
neoplasms in children and young adults. Two patients studied by Davis et
al. (2003) were an 18-year-old female with a history of obesity,
hirsutism, and polycystic ovary syndrome. A right renal mass was
detected, and partial nephrectomy was performed. Postoperatively, she
was well without evidence of recurrent neoplastic disease and continued
to require spironolactone for control of hirsutism. The second patient
was an 18-year-old male with clinical details reported by Argani et al.
(2001).

Kuiper et al. (2003) collected 3 cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC;
605074) from patients 14 to 42 years of age, wherein a t(6;11)(p21;q13)
translocation was the sole cytogenetic abnormality. Molecular analysis
revealed fusion of the TFEB gene on chromosome 6 to the Alpha gene
(607924) on chromosome 11. The Alpha/TFEB fusion gene linked all coding
exons of the TFEB gene to 5-prime upstream regulatory sequences of the
Alpha gene. Alpha/TFEB mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in
primary tumor cells as compared with wildtype TFEB mRNA levels in normal
kidney samples, resulting in a dramatic upregulation of TFEB protein
levels. The TFEB protein encoded by the Alpha/TFEB fusion gene was
efficiently targeted to the nucleus. Kuiper et al. (2003) speculated
that this resulted in severely unbalanced nuclear ratios of MITF
(156845)/TFE subfamily members and that this imbalance may lead to
changes in the expression of downstream target genes, ultimately
resulting in the development of RCC.

GENE FUNCTION

Sardiello et al. (2009) found that most lysosomal genes exhibit
coordinated transcription behavior and are regulated by the
transcription factor EB (TFEB). They found that 68 of 96 lysosomal genes
had a palindromic 10-bp GTCACGTGAC motif, either as a single sequence or
as tandem multiple copies, in the 5-prime untranslated region. Sardiello
et al. (2009) named this motif the Coordinated Lysosomal Expression and
Regulation (CLEAR) element. Under aberrant lysosomal storage conditions,
TFEB translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, resulting in the
activation of its target genes. TFEB overexpression in cultured cells
induced lysosomal biogenesis and increased degradation of complex
molecules such as glucosaminoglycans and polyQ-expanded huntingtin.

Settembre et al. (2011) found that starvation activates a
transcriptional program that controls major steps of the autophagic
pathway, including autophagosome formation, autophagosome-lysosome
fusion, and substrate degradation. The transcription factor EB, the
master gene for lysosomal biogenesis, coordinated this program by
driving expression of autophagy and lysosomal genes. Nuclear
localization and activity of TFEB were regulated by serine
phosphorylation mediated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2
(ERK2; 176948), whose activity was tuned by the levels of extracellular
nutrients. Thus, Settembre et al. (2011) concluded that a
mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent mechanism regulates autophagy
by controlling the biogenesis and partnership of 2 distinct cellular
organelles.

612647	TITLE *612647 RADIAL SPOKE HEAD 4, CHLAMYDOMONAS, HOMOLOG OF, A; RSPH4A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Radial spokes are regularly spaced along cilia, sperm, and flagella
axonemes and have a multisubunit 'stalk' and 'head' that form a signal
transduction scaffold between the central microtubule pair and dynein
(see 603297) arms. RSPH4A is predicted to be a component of the radial
spoke head based on homology with proteins in the biflagellate alga
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and other ciliates (Castleman et al., 2009).

CLONING

By genomewide linkage analysis and positional candidate gene analysis in
5 families with primary ciliary dyskinesia linked to chromosome 6q22
(CILD11; 612649) and central microtubule pair abnormalities, Castleman
et al. (2009) identified the RSPH4A and RSPH9 genes (612648). The
deduced RSPH4A protein contains 716 amino acids and shares about 30%
identity with the Chlamydomonas radial spoke head proteins Rsp4 and
Rsp6.

GENE STRUCTURE

Castleman et al. (2009) determined that the RSPH4A gene contains 6
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Castleman et al. (2009) mapped the RSPH4A
gene to chromosome 6q22.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 4 Pakistani families with CILD11, Castleman et
al. (2009) identified a homozygous mutation in the RSPH4A gene
(612647.0001). In affected members of a family of northern European
descent with CILD11, they identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the RSPH4A gene (612647.0001; 612647.0002). The patients
had classic respiratory features of CILD, but no situs abnormalities.
Electron microscopic studies showed complete absence of the central
microtubule pair of the ciliary axoneme. These findings suggested that
radial spoke proteins are not essential for embryonic nodal ciliary
function, which is important in the determination of left-right axis
development.

Kott et al. (2013) identified pathogenic mutations in the RSPH4A gene
(see, e.g., 612647.0004-612647.0005) in 7 (14%) of 48 families with with
a specific CILD phenotype characterized by ciliary central complex and
radial spoke defects. None of the patients had situs inversus.

In all 10 affected members of 4 Pakistani families with primary ciliary
dyskinesia-11 (612649), Castleman et al. (2009) identified a homozygous
460C-T transition in exon 1 of the RSPH4A gene, resulting in a
gln154-to-ter (Q154X) substitution. The patients had classic respiratory
features of CILD, but no situs abnormalities. Electron microscopic
studies showed complete absence of the central microtubule pair of the
ciliary axoneme.

In affected individuals in a family of northern European descent with
CILD11 (612649), Castleman et al. (2009) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the RSPH4A gene: a 325C-T transition
in exon 1 resulting in a gln109-to-ter (Q109X) substitution, and a
1468C-T transition in exon 3 resulting in an arg490-to-ter (R490X;
612647.0003) substitution. The patients had classic respiratory features
of CILD, but no situs abnormalities. Electron microscopic studies showed
complete absence of the central microtubule pair of the ciliary axoneme.

In a family with primary CILD11 (612649) without situs inversus, Kott et

gene: a 1-bp deletion (667delA), resulting in premature termination
(Ser223AlafsTer15), and a 1-bp deletion (c.1720delA; 612647.0005),
resulting premature termination (Thr424GlnfsTer19). Transmission
electron microscopy showed that a variable proportion of cilia on
respiratory epithelial cells had central complex defects. Radial spokes
were absent in cilia with no central microtubule complex.

605370	TITLE *605370 RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 26; ARHGAP26
;;GTPase REGULATOR ASSOCIATED WITH FOCAL ADHESION KINASE; GRAF;;
KIAA0621
GRAF/MLL FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Borkhardt et al. (2000) stated that mutual translocations involving
11q23 in acute leukemias had been demonstrated to show fusion between
the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL; 159555) gene and a variety of different
partner genes to a total of 23. The detection of a unique
t(5;11)(q31;q23) in an infant with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia
(JMML; 607785) and an MLL gene rearrangement provided an opportunity to
clone another MLL fusion partner gene. By cloning the breakpoints in
this translocation, Borkhardt et al. (2000) recovered a member of the
GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family, which they identified as the
human homolog of the avian GRAF gene (Hildebrand et al., 1996).

Ishikawa et al. (1998) cloned a GRAF cDNA, which they designated
KIAA0621, from a human brain cDNA library and found that it encodes a
deduced 753-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 87 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Hildebrand et al. (1996) determined that the GRAF gene is highly
homologous to the BCR gene (151410), which is also involved in a
leukemia-associated translocation. The avian GRAF protein binds to the
C-terminal domain of pp125(FAK), one of the tyrosine kinases predicted
to be a critical component of the integrin signaling transduction
pathway, in an SH3 domain-dependent manner and stimulates the GTPase
activity of the GTP-binding protein RhoA. Thus, GRAF acts as a negative
regulator of RhoA.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, in vitro binding assays, and
immunoprecipitation analysis, Shibata et al. (2001) showed that PKN-beta
(PKN3; 610714) interacted with GRAF and GRAF2 (ARHGAP10; 609746). A
constitutively active form of PKN-beta phosphorylated recombinant GRAF
and GRAF2. Mutation analysis showed that the linker region of PKN-beta
bound to the SH3 domains of GRAF and GRAF2.

MAPPING

Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the GRAF gene to chromosome 5. Borkhardt
et al. (2000) found that the GRAF gene maps outside the 5q31 region that
is commonly deleted in hematologic malignancies; however, inactivation
of both alleles in at least some cases suggests that deletions and
mutations of the GRAF gene may be instrumental in the development and
progression of hematologic disorders with a del(5q). By FISH, Borkhardt
et al. (2000) confirmed the assignment of GRAF to 5q31.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Borkhardt et al. (2000) sequenced several cDNA clones from 13 cases of
hematologic malignancy in which 1 allele of GRAF was deleted. In 1
patient with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML; 607785), they found
a point mutation within the GAP domain of the second GRAF allele
(605370.0001). In 2 additional patients, they found an insertion of 52
or 74 bp within the GRAF cDNA, which generated a reading frameshift
followed by a premature stop codon (605370.0002-605370.0003). The
mutations were apparently somatic events.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LEUKEMIA, JUVENILE MYELOMONOCYTIC, SOMATIC
ARHGAP26, ASN417SER

In a leukemic cells derived from a patient with juvenile myelomonocytic
leukemia (JMML; 607785) and a fusion between the MLL gene on 11q and the
GRAF gene on 5q, Borkhardt et al. (2000) identified in the other GRAF
allele an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 1255 that resulted in the
substitution of a serine for an asparagine at amino acid 417. This was
thought to be a second hit in a leukemogenic process.

.0002
LEUKEMIA, JUVENILE MYELOMONOCYTIC, SOMATIC
ARHGAP26, 52-BP INS

In leukemic cells from a patient with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia
(JMML; 607785) and a reciprocal translocation t(5;11)(q31;q23) involving
the GRAF and MLL genes, Borkhardt et al. (2000) found that the other
allele of the GRAF gene carried a 52-bp insertion at the splice junction
of exons 12 and 13. The exon/intron boundary was located at nucleotides
1290/91. The insertion led to a reading frameshift that generated a stop
codon. The predicted truncated GRAF protein lacked almost the entire GAP
domain and therefore was most likely not functional. The 52-bp insertion
(nucleotides 32560-32611) originated from a 524-bp long sequence located
upstream of the 3-prime splice site of the adjacent nearly 13-kb long
intron. Because the insertion is imbedded in perfect splice donor and
acceptor sites, it was thought to be the result of aberrant splicing.

.0003
LEUKEMIA, JUVENILE MYELOMONOCYTIC, SOMATIC
ARHGAP26, 74-BP INS

In leukemic cells from a patient with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia
(JMML; 607785) and a t(5;11)(q31;q23) involving the N-terminal part of
MLL and the C-terminal part of the GRAF gene, Borkhardt et al. (2000)
found that the GRAF allele on the other chromosome 5 carried a 74-bp
insertion located in the 60-kb long intron between exons 15 and 16. The
insertion presumably generated a stop codon. The predicted protein
lacked the SH3 domain of GRAF that was shown to be necessary for the
interaction with the focal adhesion kinase.

602892	TITLE *602892 KILLER CELL LECTIN-LIKE RECEPTOR, SUBFAMILY C, MEMBER 3; KLRC3
;;NKG2E
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes that can mediate lysis of
certain tumor cells and virus-infected cells without previous
activation. Members of the NKG2 gene family encode NK cell-specific
lectin-like molecules that may have receptor function. See 161555. By
screening an NK cell library with an NKG2C (KLR2C; 602891) cDNA,
Adamkiewicz et al. (1994) identified cDNAs corresponding to a member of
the NKG2 family that they called NKG2E. The sequence of the predicted
261-amino acid protein is 95% identical to that of NKG2C over the first
191 amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Glienke et al. (1998) determined that the NKG2C, NKG2E, and NKG2F
(602893) genes are highly similar except for variability at their
3-prime ends. The NKG2C gene contains 6 exons, whereas NKG2E has 7 exons
and NKG2F has only 4 exons.

MAPPING

By analysis of a cosmid contig, Plougastel and Trowsdale (1998) found
that the NKG2E gene and other members of the NKG2 gene family are
clustered within 350 kb on 12p13.2-p12.3. This cluster is located within
the NK complex, a region that contains C-type lectin genes
preferentially expressed on NK cells.

604941	TITLE *604941 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2, REGULATORY SUBUNIT B, ALPHA; PPP2R2A
;;PR55-ALPHA;;
B55-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Protein phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues by protein
kinases is responsible for the communication of many intracellular
signals. Equally important is the dephosphorylation of proteins by
serine/threonine phosphatases. Protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A; see
176915), a heterotrimeric serine/threonine phosphatase, has a
particularly complex set of regulatory subunits controlling its function
and localization. By screening lung fibroblast and fetal brain cDNA
libraries using 2 overlapping oligonucleotides corresponding to a
tryptic peptide derived from the 55-kD subunit of rabbit PP2A (PR55),
Mayer et al. (1991) isolated human cDNAs encoding PPP2R2A and PPP2R2B
(604325), which they termed PR55-alpha and PR55-beta, respectively. The
deduced 447-amino acid PPP2R2A protein has a calculated molecular mass
of approximately 52 kD. SDS-PAGE analysis, however, showed that PPP2R2A
was expressed as a 55-kD protein. The nucleotide sequence of PPP2R2A is
75% identical to PPP2R2B in the coding region. Northern blot analysis
detected PPP2R2A transcripts of 2.3 and 2.5 kb, as well as a less
abundant one of 4.4 kb, in all cell lines examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Hyperphosphorylation of Tau (MAPT; 157140) contributes to Alzheimer
disease (104300), and PP2A dephosphorylates Tau, reducing its
deleterious effect. Using an in vitro assay with recombinant human
proteins, Xu et al. (2008) showed that the B-alpha subunit specifically
and markedly facilitated dephosphorylation of phosphorylated Tau by
heterotrimeric PP2A.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PPP2R2A
gene to chromosome 8 (TMAP WI-18898).

605675	TITLE *605675 RING FINGER PROTEIN 14; RNF14
;;ANDROGEN RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 54; ARA54
DESCRIPTION The RING finger motif is a unique zinc-chelating domain involved in
mediating protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. Using the
sequence of the partial cDNA clone HFB30 isolated by Ueki et al. (1998)
to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library, Ueki et al. (1999) cloned
the full-length cDNA, which encoded a novel ring finger protein, RNF14.
The deduced 474-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
approximately 53 kD. RT-PCR analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of
RNF14 in a wide variety of human tissues.

Kang et al. (1999) independently cloned RNF14, which they called ARA54
(androgen receptor-associated protein-54), by a yeast 2-hybrid screen of
a prostate cDNA library. Northern blot analysis detected a major 3-kb
transcript, with highest expression in testis, followed by thymus,
spleen, colon, prostate, and uterus. Low expression was detected in
small intestine and blood leukocytes. The RNF14 transcript was also
strongly detected in 2 other prostate cell lines. A second transcript of
2 kb was detected in testis only. Kang et al. (1999) demonstrated that
RNF14 can function as a coactivator for androgen-dependent transcription
on both wildtype and mutant androgen receptor (313700). They also showed
that in the presence of a certain amount of 17-beta-estradiol or
hydroxyflutamide, the transcriptional activity of a specific AR mutant
was significantly enhanced, whereas that of wildtype and another AR
mutant was not. The authors suggested that both RNF14 and the positions
of the AR mutation might contribute to the specificity of AR-mediated
transactivation.

Ueki et al. (1999) determined that the RNF14 gene contains 9 exons and
spans approximately 20 kb of genomic DNA. By somatic cell hybrid and
radiation hybrid analyses, Ueki et al. (1999) mapped the RNF14 gene to
chromosome 5q23.3-q31.1.

601633	TITLE *601633 N-ETHYLMALEIMIDE-SENSITIVE FACTOR; NSF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mammalian N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive protein was first described by
Glick and Rothman (1987) as the protein that restored the ability of
Golgi membranes that had been inactivated with the reagent
N-ethylmaleimide to re-engage in vesicular transport. The NSF gene was
subsequently cloned from Chinese hamster cells by Block et al. (1988)
and Wilson et al. (1989). NSF is a member of the AAA (ATPases associated
with diverse cellular activities) gene family. Hoyle et al. (1996)
stated that the genes are most related throughout the approximately
200-amino acid domain (the AAA domain) that binds ATP; however, the
family is notable not only for its conservation but also for diverse
functions of its proteins in eukaryotic cells. The family can be
subdivided into those with either 1 or 2 ATP-binding domains. NSF is a
2-domain member of the AAA family. Valosin-containing protein (601023),
which is also involved in membrane fusion, is another 2-AAA domain
protein.

GENE FUNCTION

The process of vesicle targeting and fusion in the secretory and
endocytic pathways has been described by the SNAREs hypothesis (Rothman,
1994). This proposes that vesicles dock with specific target membranes
by binding to membrane-specific SNAREs (soluble
N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factors attachment protein receptors) (see
604026). Hoyle et al. (1996) noted that targeting specificity is also
affected by the Rabs, a group of small soluble GTPases. After the
vesicle has bound to the target membrane, the SNARE multimer is joined
by the soluble SNAP proteins and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor
(NSF). The resulting large complex is thought to allow membrane fusion
and the ATPase activity of the NSF appears to be essential for the
process. Hoyle et al. (1996) stated that while many of different SNAREs,
Rabs, and SNAPs are involved in membrane fusion, there is only 1 NSF,
and the SNARE hypothesis describes NSF-dependent fusion.

By use of microarray expression profiling of prefrontal cortex from
matched pairs of patients with schizophrenia (181500) and control
subjects and hierarchical data analysis, Mirnics et al. (2000) found
that transcripts encoding proteins involved in the regulation of
presynaptic function were decreased in all subjects with schizophrenia.
Genes of presynaptic function showed a different combination of
decreased expression across subjects. Over 250 other gene groups did not
show altered expression. Selected presynaptic function gene microarray
observations were verified by in situ hybridization. Two of the most
consistently changed transcripts in the presynaptic functional gene
group, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor and synapsin-2 (600755), were
decreased in 10 of 10 and 9 of 10 subjects with schizophrenia,
respectively. The combined data suggested that subjects with
schizophrenia share a common abnormality in presynaptic function.

MAPPING

By PCR amplification in a human monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid
mapping panel, Hoyle et al. (1996) mapped the NSF gene to human
chromosome 17. To determine a regional mapping position for NSF and to
confirm their cell hybrid results, they isolated NSF-containing human
cosmids for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) mapping. The
results showed that the gene mapped to 17q21-q22. They mapped the mouse
homolog, Nsf, to mouse chromosome 11 by analysis of DNA from
interspecific backcrosses. Hoyle et al. (1996) noted that there are
neurologic disorders mapping in that region of chromosome 17, such as
DDBAC (600274) and PPND (600274), which may be allelic disorders. They
noted that NSF is preferentially expressed in the mammalian nervous
system. An aberrant Nsf gene in Drosophila results in defective synaptic
transmission.

612911	TITLE *612911 NADH DEHYDROGENASE 1 ALPHA SUBCOMPLEX, ASSEMBLY FACTOR 3; NDUFAF3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hartmann and Stamm (1997) cloned rat Ndufaf3, which they called E3-3,
and identified the human ortholog by EST database analysis. RT-PCR
detected E3-3 expression in all rat tissues examined, with highest
expression in testis.

Using human SOB1 (AKAP3; 604689) in a low-stringency screen of a mouse
germinal cell cDNA library, Hammami-Hamza et al. (2003) cloned mouse
Ndufaf3, which they called 2P1. Northern blot analysis detected
expression only in mouse testis. In situ hybridization detected 2P1 in
stage I pachytene spermatocytes, and expression persisted until stage
XII of the spermatogenic cycle. No expression was detected in
interstitial tissue.

Saada et al. (2009) stated that the NDUFAF3 gene encodes 2 isoforms, A
and B, which share a 'domain of unknown function' (DUF498). The longer A
isoform harbors a predicted N-terminal mitochondrial-targeting sequence
of about 35 amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

The NDUFAF3 gene contains 4 exons (Saada et al., 2009).

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the NDUFAF3 gene to chromosome 3p21.31 based on an
alignment of the NDUFAF3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AL049955) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

GENE FUNCTION

Using subcellular fractionation experiments, Saada et al. (2009) showed
that NDUFAF3 was predominantly localized to mitochondria and remained in
the pellet after carbonate extraction, suggesting a strong interaction
with the mitochondrial membrane, although NDUFAF3 has no predicted
transmembrane helices. Localization appeared identical to that of
NDUFAF4 (611776). RNA interference studies indicated that the NDUFAF3
gene product is necessary for mitochondrial complex I assembly. The
activity of NDUFAF3 showed functional interdependence with NDUFAF4. Gene
conservation analysis linked NDUFAF3 to the bacterial-membrane-insertion
gene cluster SecF/SecD/YajC and C8ORF38 (612392), suggesting a
translation-dependent early assembly mechanism.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 5 patients with severe mitochondrial complex I deficiency (252010)
and lactic acidosis, Saada et al. (2009) identified homozygous or
compound heterozygous mutations in the NDUFAF3 gene
(612911.0001-612911.0003). All patients died before age 6 months.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NDUFAF3, GLY77ARG

In 3 Muslim sibs with severe mitochondrial complex I deficiency (252010)
resulting in death by age 3 months, Saada et al. (2009) identified a
homozygous 229G-C transversion in the NDUFAF3 gene, resulting in a
gly77-to-arg (G77R) substitution. The parents were consanguineous.

.0002
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NDUFAF3, ARG122PRO

In a male infant with severe mitochondrial complex I deficiency
(252010), Saada et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 365G-C
transversion in the NDUFAF3 gene, resulting in an arg122-to-pro (R122P)
substitution at the C-terminal end of the protein. The child was born of
consanguineous Arab Muslim parents. At 3 weeks of age, he became
hypoactive and sucked poorly. Physical examination revealed
macrocephaly, a weak cry, wide anterior fontanel, and axial hypotonia.
He had intermittent generalized tonic movements, and funduscopy showed
pallor of the optic discs. At 3 months of age, there was no eye contact
and marked axial hypotonia with brisk tendon reflexes. He died at age 4
months.

.0003
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NDUFAF3, MET1THR

In a female infant with severe mitochondrial complex I deficiency
(252010), Saada et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for
mutation in the NDUFAF3 gene: a 2T-C transition, resulting in a
met1-to-thr (M1T) substitution, and the R122P (612911.0002) mutation.
She was the daughter of unrelated parents of Jewish origin. At age 3
months, she developed myoclonic seizures, and brain MRI revealed diffuse
brain leukomalacia. She died at age 6 months of respiratory failure.
Complex I activity was markedly decreased.

611550	TITLE *611550 NATURAL CYTOTOXICITY TRIGGERING RECEPTOR 3; NCR3
;;1C7;;
ACTIVATING NATURAL KILLER RECEPTOR p30; NKp30;;
CD337 ANTIGEN; CD337
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs), such as NCR3, are activating
natural killer (NK) cell receptors that belong to the immunoglobulin
(Ig) superfamily. NCR3 is expressed in all resting and activated NK
cells and forms a complex with CD3-zeta (CD3Z, or CD247; 186780) (Sato
et al., 2001).

CLONING

Pende et al. (1999) generated monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and identified
one that reacted with a 30-kD integral membrane protein, NKp30, on NK
cells and cell lines. By screening an NK cell cDNA expression library,
they isolated a cDNA encoding NKp30. The deduced 190-amino acid protein
has a signal peptide followed by a 120-amino acid extracellular region
that forms a V-type Ig-like domain with 2 potential N-linked
glycosylation sites; a hydrophobic transmembrane region with a
positively charged arg residue; and a 33-amino acid cytoplasmic tail
lacking an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif (ITAM).
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.0-kb transcript only in NK cells.

Using Northern blot analysis, Sivakamasundari et al. (2000) detected a
1.35-kb 1C7 transcript in human spleen, lymph node, and blood
leukocytes, with lower expression in appendix. They noted that the 3
principal IC7 splice variants differ in exon 4, and RT-PCR showed that
all 3 were expressed in human tonsil and NKL cells. However, a unique
splicing pattern was observed in human liver, including differential
usage of exon 2. Fluorescence microscopy of transfected COS-7 cells
showed cytoplasmic and perinuclear expression of IC7.
Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed expression of
IC7 in tonsillar NK germinal center cells. Western blot analysis
detected IC7 protein in human tonsil, NKL cells, and brain.
Sivakamasundari et al. (2000) noted that Ic7 is a pseudogene in mouse,
but not rat.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Neville and Campbell (1999) mapped the NCR3 gene
centromeric to LST1 (LY117; 109170) and telomeric to AIF1 (601833) on
chromosome 6p21.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Pende et al. (1999) found that treatment of NK cells with anti-NKp30
inhibited natural cytotoxicity against normal target cells and most
tumor cells. Further analysis determined that NKp30 sometimes cooperated
with NKp44 (NCR2; 604531) and NKp46 (NCR1; 604530) in mediating
cytotoxicity. Western blot analysis showed that NKp30 associated with
CD3Z. Thus, NKp30 can transduce activating signals by its association
with ITAM-containing CD3Z polypeptides.

Using flow cytometric analysis, Arnon et al. (2005) showed that pp65,
the main tegument protein of human cytomegalovirus, inhibited NK cell
cytotoxicity by interacting directly and specifically with NKp30. The
interaction led to dissociation of CD3Z from NKp30 and, consequently,
reduced killing.

Using RT-PCR analysis, Mulcahy et al. (2006) detected significantly
increased expression of LST1 (109170) in blood of rheumatoid arthritis
(RA; 180300) patients and of NCR3 in blood and synovium of RA patients
compared with controls. The increased LST1 and NCR3 expression was
independent of any increase in inflammatory cells. Both genes were also
significantly upregulated in response to lipopolysaccharide, IFNG
(147570), and bacterial infection. Mulcahy et al. (2006) concluded that
LST1 and NCR3 are involved in infection, autoimmune-related
inflammation, and dendritic cell/NK cell-associated functions.

Mavoungou et al. (2007) found that NKp30- and NKp46-Ig fusion proteins
interacted with the Duffy binding-like-1-alpha (Dbl1a) domain of P.
falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 on the surface of infected red
cells. The interaction was functional, leading NK cells to produce
perforin (PRF1; 170280) and granzyme B (GZMB; 123910) and to lyse
infected erythrocytes.

Using NKp30-Fc fusion proteins to screen for molecules binding NKp30 and
triggering NKp30-mediated cytolysis, followed by proteomic and mass
spectrometric analyses, Brandt et al. (2009) identified B7H6 (613714).
Using surface plasmon resonance experiments, they confirmed interaction
between B7H6 and NKp30, and interaction of the 2 proteins could be
blocked by anti-NKp30. Expression of B7H6 in a murine mastocytoma line
enabled cytotoxicity by an NKp30-expressing NK cell line and by IL2
(147680)-activated primary human NK cells.

In transfection studies of a human NK cell line, Delahaye et al. (2011)
observed functional differences between the 3 alternatively spliced exon
4 isoforms of NCR3. The 3 isoforms transmitted distinct signals: both
NCR3a and NCR3b stimulated Th1 cytokine release, including IL12 (see
161561) and gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570), whereas NCR3a was the only
isoform that triggered cytotoxicity. These functions were consistent
with an immunostimulatory effect. In contrast, NCR3c promoted IL10
(124092) production, relaying an immunosuppressive signal through rapid
phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase (MAPK14; 600289).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Li et al. (2011) determined the structure of NKp30 in complex with B7H6.
NKp30 uses both front and back beta sheets of its Ig-like domain to bind
B7H6, in contrast to CTLA4 (123890) and PD1 (PDCD1; 600244), which only
use the front beta sheet to bind ligands. B7H6 contacts NKp30 through
the complementarity-determining region-like loops of its V-like domain
in an antibody-like interaction not seen for B7 (CD80; 112203) or PDL
(PDCD1LG1; 605402). Li et al. (2011) proposed that the NKp30-B7H6
structure may be useful in designing molecules to stimulate
NKp30-mediated cytolytic activity for tumor immunotherapy.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Sato et al. (2001) identified SNPs in the promoter region and in exon 2
of the NCR3 gene.

A susceptibility locus for mild malaria maps to the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6 (MALS; 609148),
and polymorphisms in TNF (191160), which is 15 kb proximal to NCR3, are
associated with mild malaria. By genotyping 10 NCR3 SNPs in a
malaria-endemic Burkina Faso population, Delahaye et al. (2007)
identified an association between mild malaria and the -412G-C
(611550.0001; dbSNP rs2736191) SNP in the NCR3 promoter. Carriers with
the -412C variant had more frequent mild malaria attacks than -412GG
individuals. NCR3 -412C and a haplotype containing -412C were
significantly associated with increased risk of mild malaria, and the
association was independent of TNF. Delahaye et al. (2007) concluded
that at least 2 centrally located MHC region genes are involved in
genetic control of malaria. They proposed that genetic variation in
NK-cell receptors may account for the heterogeneity of NK-cell
reactivity to P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes.

Delahaye et al. (2011) found an association between alternatively
spliced exon 4 isoforms of NCR3 and prognosis in gastrointestinal
stromal tumors (GIST; 606764). In a study of 44 GIST tumors,
tumor-infiltrating NK cells showed downregulation of NCR3 compared to
circulating cells of healthy volunteers. The density of the NK cell
infiltrate was inversely correlated with the presence of metastasis at
diagnosis, suggesting an NK cell-mediated immunosurveillance mechanism
in these tumors. RT-PCR studies of peripheral blood from 80 patients
with GIST showed preferential expression of the immunosuppressive NCR3c
isoform in 53%, compared to healthy volunteers, of whom only 30%
expressed isoform NCR3c (p = 0.02). NK cells from GIST patients with the
NCR3c isoform showed a defect in NCR3-driven NK effector functions. A
retrospective analysis of 80 GIST patients treated with imatinib showed
decreased overall survival in those with the NRC3c isoform compared to
those with NRC3a and NRC3b isoforms (p = 0.001). Delahaye et al. (2011)
also found an association between a 3790T-C SNP (dbSNP rs986475) in the
promoter region of the NCR3 gene, as well as other SNPs, and expression
of the NCR3c isoform. The findings suggested that the genetically
determined NCR3 status may predict clinical outcome in patients with
GIST.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MALARIA, MILD, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
NCR3, -412G-C, 5-PRIME UTR

By genotyping 10 NCR3 SNPs in 34 families comprising 53 parents and 140
sibs in a P. falciparum malaria-endemic region of Burkina Faso, Delahaye
et al. (2007) identified a significant association between mild malaria
(609148) and a SNP in the NCR3 promoter, a G-to-C change at position
-412 (dbSNP rs2736191) relative to the transcription start site.
Carriers with the -412C variant had more frequent mild malaria attacks
than -412GG individuals, and -412C and a haplotype containing -412C were
significantly associated with increased risk of mild malaria.
