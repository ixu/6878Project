602775	TITLE *602775 SUPPRESSOR OF CLEAR, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF; SHOC2
;;RAS-BINDING PROTEIN SUR8, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF; SUR8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Activation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors elicits diverse
cellular responses, including growth, mitogenesis, migration, and
differentiation. Selfors et al. (1998) shed light on the intracellular
signaling pathways that mediate these processes by studies in
Caenorhabditis elegans. In this organism, they screened for genes that
suppress the activity of an activated form of the EGL-15 FGF receptor
consistent with the functioning of these genes downstream of EGL-15. Two
of these genes were soc1 and soc2, symbolized thus for 'suppressor of
clear (Clr)' phenotype; the third was sem5. Selfors et al. (1998) showed
that soc2 encodes a protein composed almost entirely of leucine-rich
repeats, a domain implicated in protein-protein interactions. They
identified a putative human homolog, SHOC2, which is 54% identical to
soc2. They showed that SHOC2 mRNA was expressed in all tissues assayed
and that the SHOC2 protein is localized to the cytoplasm.

Selfors et al. (1998) showed that within the leucine-rich repeats of
both soc2 and SHOC2 are 2 YXNX motifs that are potential
tyrosine-phosphorylated docking sites for the SEM5/GRB2 Src homology 2
domain. However, phosphorylation of these residues was not required for
soc2 function in vivo, and SHOC2 was not observed to be tyrosine
phosphorylated in response to FGF stimulation. Selfors et al. (1998)
concluded that this genetic system identified a conserved gene
implicated in mediating FGF receptor signaling in C. elegans.

MAPPING

By FISH analysis, Selfors et al. (1998) mapped the SHOC2 gene to
chromosome 10q25.

GENE FUNCTION

Sieburth et al. (1998) identified and characterized the sur8 gene in C.
elegans, which positively regulates Ras-mediated signal transduction
during vulval development. The authors found that reduction of sur8
function suppresses an activated Ras mutation and dramatically enhances
phenotypes of mpk1/sur1 MAP kinase (see 176948) and ksr1 (601132)
mutations, whereas increase of sur8 dosage enhances an activated Ras
mutation. Sur8 appears to act downstream of or in parallel to Ras but
upstream of Raf. Sur8 encodes a conserved protein that is composed
predominantly of leucine-rich repeats. The sur8 protein interacts
directly with Ras but not with the Ras(P34G) mutant protein, suggesting
that sur8 may mediate its effects through Ras binding. By use of EST
primers and 5-prime RACE, Sieburth et al. (1998) cloned a structural and
functional SUR8 homolog in humans that specifically binds K-Ras (190070)
and N-Ras (164790) but not H-Ras (190020) in vitro.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using a systems biology approach based on in silico protein network
analysis that identified SHOC2 as a candidate gene, Cordeddu et al.
(2009) sequenced SHOC2 coding exons in a Noonan syndrome (see 163950)
cohort that included 96 individuals who were negative for mutations in
known disease genes. The authors identified a heterozygous mutation
(S2G; 602775.0001) in the SHOC2 gene in 4 unrelated individuals. They
then analyzed the SHOC2 gene in a cohort of 410 mutation-negative
patients with Noonan syndrome or a related phenotype and identified 21
individuals with the same S2G mutation. All of the patients with the S2G
mutation had a relatively consistent Noonan syndrome-like disorder with
loose anagen hair (NSLH; 607721). Functional studies of S2G-mutant SHOC2
demonstrated introduction of an N-myristoylation site, resulting in
aberrant localization and signaling.

In a male infant with typical dysmorphic facial features and other signs
of Noonan syndrome, who died of congestive heart failure at 4 months of
age, Hoban et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for the S2G mutation
in SHOC2.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NOONAN SYNDROME-LIKE DISORDER WITH LOOSE ANAGEN HAIR
SHOC2, SER2GLY

In 21 patients with a Noonan syndrome-like disorder with loose anagen
hair (NSLH; 607721), Cordeddu et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity
for a 4A-G transition in exon 2 of the SHOC2 gene, resulting in a
ser2-to-gly (S2G) substitution. The mutation was shown to be de novo in
the 15 patients for whom parental DNA was available. Functional studies
demonstrated that the S2G mutation introduces an N-myristoylation site,
resulting in aberrant targeting of SHOC2 to the plasma membrane and
impaired translocation to the nucleus upon growth factor stimulation. In
vitro expression of mutant SHOC2 enhanced MAPK (176948) activation in a
cell type-specific fashion. Induction of mutant SHOC2 in C. elegans
engendered protruding vulva, a neomorphic phenotype previously
associated with aberrant signaling.

In a male infant with typical dysmorphic facial features and other signs
of Noonan syndrome, who died of congestive heart failure at 4 months of
age, Hoban et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for the S2G mutation
in SHOC2. The authors noted that the 'loose anagen hair' phenotype and
skin features previously reported in patients with the S2G mutation were
not present in this young infant, and stated that the cardiac anomaly
expanded the clinical phenotype associated with the SHOC2 mutation.

605446	TITLE *605446 RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA GTPase REGULATOR-INTERACTING PROTEIN; RPGRIP1
;;RPGR-INTERACTING PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mutations in the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator gene (RPGR;
312610) cause X-linked retinitis pigmentosa-3 (RP3), a severe,
progressive, and degenerative retinal dystrophy that eventually leads to
complete blindness. RPGR is ubiquitously expressed, yet mutations in the
RPGR gene lead to a retina-restricted phenotype. Using the yeast
2-hybrid system, Boylan and Wright (2000) screened a bovine retina cDNA
library for RPGR-interacting proteins and identified a novel protein,
which they called RPGRIP1. They confirmed the specificity of the
interaction between RPGR and RPGRIP1 by coimmunoprecipitation of in
vitro translated protein and use of RPGR mutants. By EST database
searching, Boylan and Wright (2000) identified a human homolog of the
bovine gene. By PCR and 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, they isolated 2 human
RPGRIP1 cDNAs, which appeared to be alternatively spliced orthologs of
the bovine gene, encoding deduced proteins of 586 and 902 amino acids
Dryja et al. (2001) found that the cDNA sequence in this report lacked
the 5-prime end of the gene and deduced protein contains 1,259 amino
acids. Boylan and Wright (2000) found that the RPGRIP1 proteins are
predicted to form 2 coiled-coil domains at the N terminus, which are
seen in some proteins involved in vesicular trafficking. Northern blot
analysis detected a strong 2.0-kb and a weak 3.1-kb transcript in testis
only. RT-PCR analysis detected strong expression of RPGRIP1 in retina,
with weaker expression in testis. Roepman et al. (2000) also cloned
RPGRIP1 cDNAs and identified several alternatively spliced gene
products, some with retina-restricted expression, that interact
specifically with RPGR in vivo and in vitro. They demonstrated that RPGR
and RPGRIP1 colocalize in the outer segment of rod photoreceptors, which
is in agreement with the retinitis pigmentosa phenotype observed in RP3
patients.

Hong et al. (2001) cloned the mouse ortholog of RPGRIP1. Northern blot
analysis detected a retina-specific Rpgrip1 transcript of approximately
10.0 kb in wildtype mice but not in rd mice with photoreceptor
degeneration (see 180072). Immunoblot analysis showed retina
photoreceptor-specific expression of a 210-kD protein.
Immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated
localization of Rpgrip1 at the junction between the inner and outer
segments, suggesting a localization in the connecting cilia. Rpgrip1
localization was the same in the absence of Rpgr, suggesting that Rpgr
is anchored to the connecting cilium through its interaction with
Rpgrip1. Because mouse photoreceptors are overwhelmingly rods, Hong et
al. (2001) extended their localization studies to the 13-lined ground
squirrel, whose photoreceptors are 95% cones. The localization of
Rpgrip1 was the same, indicating that it is localized in the connecting
cilia of both rod and cone photoreceptors. The authors concluded that
RPGRIP1 is a structural component of the ciliary axoneme.

Gerber et al. (2001) determined that the RPGRIP1 gene encodes a
predicted protein product of 1,287 amino acids.

Roepman et al. (2005) identified 2 central Ca(2+)-binding C2 domains,
one of which is truncated, in RPGRIP1. The C2 domains are encoded by
exons 14 to 16 and are absent from some RPGRIP1 isoforms.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dryja et al. (2001) determined that the RPGRIP1 gene contains 25 exons.

Gerber et al. (2001) characterized the complete exon-intron structure of
the RPGRIP1 gene. RPGRIP1 encompasses 24 coding exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Mavlyutov et al. (2002) used isoform-specific antibodies to demonstrate
that RPGR and RPGRIP isoforms are distributed and colocalized at
restricted foci throughout the outer segments of human and bovine (but
not murine) rod photoreceptors. In humans, these proteins are also
localized in cone outer segments, and RPGRIP is expressed in other
neurons such as amacrine cells. The authors proposed the existence of
species-specific subcellular processes governing the function and/or
organization of the photoreceptor outer segment as reflected by the
species-specific localization of RPGR and RPGRIP protein isoforms in
this compartment. They contended that this may provide a rationale for
the disparity of phenotypes among species and among various human
mutations.

Castagnet et al. (2003) demonstrated the existence of RPGRIP1 isoforms
with distinct cellular and subcellular localizations and biochemical
properties in the retina. High mass RPGRIP1 isoforms p175/p150 were
enriched in the outer segment compartment of photoreceptors. The
remaining isoforms were present across subcellular fractions, including
nuclei, and were soluble. The p175/p150 isoforms were predominantly
sequestered in the cytoskeleton-insoluble fraction of outer segment and
nuclei. In selective amacrine cells and in the transformed photoreceptor
line 661W, RPGRIP1 isoforms localized at restricted foci in or near
nuclear pore complexes. Among the nucleoporins, RPGRIP1 isoforms
selectively associated in vivo with RAN-binding protein-2 (RANBP2;
601181). RPGRIP1 isoforms also decorated microtubules in 661W cells and
occasionally formed coiled-like inclusion bodies in the perikarya. These
results supported distinct but complementary functions of RPGRIP1
isoforms in cytoskeletal-mediated processes in photoreceptors and
amacrine neurons. Castagnet et al. (2003) concluded that their data
implicated a role of RANBP2 in the pathogenesis of neuroretinopathies
and as a docking station to mediate the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of
RPGRIP1 isoforms and their interaction with other partners in amacrine
and 661W neurons.

Lu and Ferreira (2005) identified expression of a novel RPGRIP1
transcript in human retina generated by use of an alternative donor
splice site that leads to the skipping of 33 nucleotides from the
canonical exon 13. This novel transcript is of very low abundance in
retina compared with the counterpart transcript isoform expressing
constitutive exons 13 and 14. The authors suggested that screening of
only the constitutive exons of the RPGRIP1 gene in patients with LCA
could result in underreporting of mutations, and considered it likely
that translationally silent and other types of mutations, sometimes
considered to be neutral polymorphisms, in the genomic region
encompassing exons 12 through 14 could lead to aberrant transcripts.

In cultured mammalian cells, Shu et al. (2005) showed that both the
RPGR-ORF15 isoform (312610) and RPGRIP1 localized to centrioles
throughout the cell cycle, and RPGR-ORF15 and RGRIP1 colocalized at
basal bodies in cells with primary cilia.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Roepman et al. (2005) determined that NPHP4
(607215) interacted with C2 domain-containing RPGRIP1 isoforms. Analysis
of the interaction in the presence of Ca(2+) chelators indicated that
the binding was Ca(2+) independent. NPHP1 colocalized with C2-containing
RPGRIP1 isoforms in bovine and mouse retina. Mutations in NPHP4
associated with Senior-Loken syndrome-4 (606996) and mutations in RPGRP1
associated with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA6; 613826) disrupted the
interaction between the 2 proteins.

Lu et al. (2005) showed that the bovine isoforms Rpgrip1 and Rgrip1b
underwent limited proteolysis constitutively in vivo in the cytoplasm
compartment. This led to the relocation and accumulation of a 7-kD
N-terminal domain to the nucleus, whereas the cytosolic C-terminal
domain of Rpgrip1 was degraded and short-lived. Rpgrip1 mutations
(605446.0007 and 605446.0008) in the RPGR-interacting domain (RID)
exhibited strong cis-acting and antagonistic biologic effects on the
nuclear relocation, subcellular distribution and proteolytic cleavage of
Rpgrip1 and/or domains thereof. Lu et al. (2005) proposed distinct and
spatiotemporal subcellular-specific roles for RPGRIP1 and further
hypothesized a RPGRIP1-mediated nucleocytoplasmic crosstalk and
transport pathway regulated by RID, and hence by RPGR.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and radiation hybrid analysis, Boylan
and Wright (2000) and Roepman et al. (2000) mapped the RPGRIP1 gene to
chromosome 14q11. Roepman et al. (2000) suggested that the localization
of RPGRIP1 at 14q11 makes it a strong candidate gene for RP16.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Leber Congenital Amaurosis 6

Dryja et al. (2001) surveyed 57 unrelated patients who had Leber
congenital amaurosis for mutations in RPGRIP1 and found recessive
mutations involving both alleles in 3 (6%) patients (see LCA6, 613826).
All 4 mutations (605446.0001-605446.0004) created premature termination
codons and are likely to be null alleles.

Gerber et al. (2001) performed direct sequencing of the 24 coding exons
of the RPGRIP1 gene in 2 consanguineous families with Leber congenital
amaurosis in whom a genomewide screen had detected homozygosity at the
14q11 chromosomal region. A homozygous missense mutation and a
homozygous null mutation were identified in the 2 families,
respectively. Among 142 unrelated LCA patients, Gerber et al. (2001)
found RPGRIP1 mutations in 8 patients (5.6%). Among the 8 distinct
mutations (see, e.g., 605446.0007 and 605446.0008) detected, 5 were
truncating and 3 (2 missense and 1 in-frame deletion) concerned highly
conserved amino acids in bovine and murine sequences.

- Cone-Rod Dystrophy 13

In affected members of consanguineous Pakistani families with cone-rod
dystrophy-13 (CORD13; 608194), Hameed et al. (2003) identified
homozygosity for mutations in the RPGRIP1 gene
(605446.0005-605446.0006).

ANIMAL MODEL

Cone-rod dystrophy-1 (Cord1) is a recessive condition that occurs
naturally in miniature longhaired dachshunds. In affected dogs, Mellersh
et al. (2006) identified a 44-bp insertion in exon 2 of the Rpgrip1 gene
that altered the reading frame and introduced a premature stop codon.
All affected and carrier dogs within an extended inbred pedigree were
homozygous and heterozygous, respectively, for the mutation. Mellersh et
al. (2006) concluded that this canine disease is a model for human LCA.

Won et al. (2009) described a mouse model carrying a splice acceptor
site mutation (nmf247) in the Rpgrip1 gene that is phenotypically
distinct from Rpgrip1(tm1Tili) mice, which carry a null allele for the
long isoform. Photoreceptor degeneration in homozygous Rpgrip1(nmf247)
mice was earlier in onset and more severe than that of Rpgrip1(tm1Tili)
mice. Ultrastructural studies revealed that whereas Rpgrip1(nmf247)
mutants had a normal structure and number of connecting cilia, unlike
Rpgrip1(tm1Tili) mice, they did not elaborate rod outer segments. Won et
al. (2009) concluded that in addition to its role in outer segment disc
morphogenesis, RPGRIP1 may be essential for rod outer segment formation,
and that different isoforms may play different roles in photoreceptors.

Dryja et al. (2001) described a patient with Leber congenital

(T) at codon asp1176 and a trp65-to-ter nonsense mutation (605446.0002).
Both mutations led to premature termination and were likely to be null
alleles.

In a patient with Leber congenital amaurosis-6 (613826), Dryja et al.
(2001) identified homozygosity for a frameshift mutation, a 1-bp (T)
insertion at codon gln893.

LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 6
RPGRIP1, 1-BP DEL, LYS342

In a patient with Leber congenital amaurosis-6 (613826), Dryja et al.
(2001) identified homozygosity for a frameshift mutation in the RPGRIP1
gene. The mutation consisted of a 1-bp deletion (A) at codon lys342.

.0005
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 13
RPGRIP1, ARG827LEU

In a consanguineous Pakistani family, Hameed et al. (2003) identified
homozygosity for a 2480G-T transversion in exon 16 of the RPGRIP1 gene,
which changed codon 827 from CGC (arg) to CTC (leu), in all affected
members with cone-rod dystrophy (608194).

.0006
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 13
RPGRIP1, ALA547SER

In 3 Pakistani families, Hameed et al. (2003) found that recessive
cone-rod dystrophy (608194) segregated with homozygosity for a 1639G-T
substitution in exon 13 of the RPGRIP1 gene, which changed codon 547
from GCT (ala) to TCT (ser).

.0007
LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 6
RPGRIP1, ASP1114GLY

In a patient with Leber congenital amaurosis-6 (613826), born to
consanguineous parents of Moroccan origin, Gerber et al. (2001)
identified homozygosity for an 3341A-G transition in exon 21 of the
RPGRIP1 gene, resulting in an asp1114-to-gly (D1114G) substitution in
the RPGR-interacting domain (RID).

Lu et al. (2005) found that the D1114G mutation abolished the
interaction of RPGRIP1 in vivo with RPGR without affecting the stability
of the RID and that this interaction was not resistant to stress
stimuli. The D1114G mutation caused a redistribution of the processed
N-terminal domain fragment of RPGRIP1 between the nuclear and cytosolic
compartments.

.0008
LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 6
RPGRIP1, 3-BP DEL, 3835GAG

In a French patient with Leber congenital amaurosis-6 (613826), Gerber
et al. (2001) identified heterozygosity for a 3-bp deletion, resulting
in loss of glu1279 (delE1279) located 8 residues upstream to the stop
codon. The deletion was inherited from the patient's healthy father and
was not identified in 252 control chromosomes. A second mutation was not
identified.

Lu et al. (2005) found that the delE1279 mutation enhanced the
interaction of RPGRIP1 in vivo with RPGR without affecting the stability
of the RID. The interaction of delE1279 with RPGR was resistant to
various stress treatments such as osmotic, pH, and heat-shock stimuli,
and the delE1279 mutation caused a significant increase of the
N-terminal fragment of RPGRIP1 in the cytosolic compartment.

601961	TITLE *601961 PROTEIN ARGININE N-METHYLTRANSFERASE 2; PRMT2
;;HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN METHYLTRANSFERASE 1-LIKE 1;
HRMT1L1;;
HMT1-LIKE 1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Katsanis et al. (1997) isolated HRMT1L1, a novel transcript from
chromosome 21 similar to the rat protein arginine N-methyltransferase-1
gene (PRMT1; 602950) reported by Lin et al. (1996). Katsanis et al.
(1997) found that HRMT1L1 was expressed in all tissues they
investigated.

Scott et al. (1998) further characterized HRMT1L1 and HRMT1L2. By
Northern blot analysis, they found that HRMT1L1 is expressed as a 2.4-kb
transcript in various adult and fetal tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Katsanis et al. (1997) noted that the function of protein
methyltransferases is posttranslational methylation of arginine
residues. Two types of activity had been described, attributed to
different classes of enzymes. One methylates myelin protein zero (MPZ;
159440); the other was originally thought to methylate histones, but was
later found to methylate hnRNPs far more efficiently. The authors
suggested that HRMT1L1, a human homolog of yeast RMT1, associates with
hnRNPs.

Scott et al. (1998) found that HRMT1L1 could not methylate HNRNPA1
(164017) or any other tested substrate in vitro, and did not complement
a yeast arginine methyltransferase mutant strain.

MAPPING

Katsanis et al. (1997) mapped the PRMT2 gene to chromosome 21 by study
of monochromosomal cell hybrids and fine mapped the gene by PCR analysis
of a partial chromosome 21 hybrid panel to a telomeric position on
21q22.3. Hybridization to a YAC that was positive for S100B (176990)
indicated that PRMT2 is no more than 10 kb from S100B. S100B was the
most telomeric chromosome 21 gene known at that time.

605939	TITLE *605939 PHOSPHOLIPASE C, DELTA-4; PLCD4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC) plays an important
role in receptor-mediated signal transduction by generating 2 second
messenger molecules, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and
diacylglycerol, from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). PLC
comprises a diverse family of enzymes that differ in structure and
tissue distribution (Berridge, 1993).

CLONING

By PCR with degenerate oligonucleotide primers, Lee and Rhee (1996)
cloned PLCD4 from a rat brain cDNA library. The encoded polypeptide
contains 772 amino acids and is similar in primary structure to
delta-type PLC isozymes, with overall sequence identities of 45% to
PLC-delta-1 (602142), 72% to PLC-delta-2, and 47% to PLC-delta-3.
Recombinant PLCD4 was purified from extracts of HeLa cells that had been
infected with vaccinia virus containing the corresponding cDNA. The
purified PLCD4 protein exhibited an apparent molecular mass of 90 kD.
Specific activity and its dependence on calcium were similar to those of
PLCD1. The distribution of PLCD4 in 16 different rat tissues was studied
by immunoblot analysis with PLCD4-specific antibodies of fractions
obtained after an enzyme-enrichment procedure. The 90-kD immunoreactive
protein was detected unambiguously in only 8 tissues (testis, brain,
skeletal muscle, thyroid gland, stomach, thymus, aorta, and heart) and
was present at concentrations that were low compared to those of other
major PLC isozymes. An 86-kD band was detectable in spleen. A 93-kD
immunoreactive protein was also prominent in testis but was not detected
in the other 7 positive tissues. The 93-kD enzyme appears to be derived
from a splice variant of the mRNA that encodes the 90-kD PLCD4 and
contains an additional 32 amino acids between the X and Y catalytic
domains.

Kim et al. (1999) stated that human PLCD4 was cloned from an
oligodendroglioma cDNA library (GenBank GENBANK AI366170).

MAPPING

Kim et al. (1999) mapped the human PLCD4 gene to chromosome band 2q35 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

ANIMAL MODEL

Fukami et al. (2001) generated mice deficient in PLCD4 by targeted
disruption. Male Plcd4-deficient mice either produced few small litters
or were sterile. In vitro fertilization studies showed that insemination
with Plcd4 -/- sperm resulted in significantly fewer eggs becoming
activated and that the calcium transients associated with fertilization
were absent or delayed. Plcd4 -/- sperm were unable to initiate the
acrosome reaction, an exocytotic event required for fertilization and
induced by interaction with the egg coat, the zona pellucida. Fukami et
al. (2001) concluded that PLCD4 functions in the acrosome reaction
during mammalian fertilization.

600026	TITLE *600026 SYNTROPHIN, BETA-1; SNTB1
;;SNT2B1;;
DYSTROPHIN-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, BASIC A1; A1B;;
DAPA1B
DESCRIPTION Dystrophin-associated protein A1 is a heterogeneous group of
phosphorylated proteins consisting of distinct acidic and basic
components, designated alpha-A1 and beta-A1, respectively. From the
partial peptide sequence of A1 complex purified from rabbit muscle, Ahn
et al. (1994) designed oligonucleotide probes that were used to isolate
a cDNA for 1 human isoform of A1. This cDNA was found to encode a basic
A1 isoform that was distinct from the previously described syntrophins
in Torpedo and mouse and was expressed in many tissues with at least 5
distinct mRNA species. Comparison of the human cDNA sequence with the
GenBank expressed sequence tag (EST) database identified a sequence
related to human skeletal muscle EST25263, which was thought to be a
human homolog of mouse syntrophin-2 (see 600027). By study of a panel of
rodent/human somatic cell hybrids followed by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Ahn et al. (1994) mapped the A1B gene to 8q23-q24.

Yang et al. (1994) reviewed the heterogeneity of the 59-kD DAP which is
an intracellular protein triplet component of the
dystrophin-glycoprotein complex of muscle.

Any of the dystrophin-associated proteins are candidates for the site of
mutation in neuromuscular disease. The map location of the A1B gene
appears to exclude it as the basis of any of the human neuromuscular
diseases with known map location. However, due to the wide tissue
distribution of the A1 transcript, it is possible that a defect of this
gene would result in a nonmuscular disorder.

124095	TITLE *124095 CYTOPLASMIC TYROSINE KINASE; CSK
;;c-SRC TYROSINE KINASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Partanen et al. (1991) cloned a novel cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase
designated CSK. The CSK gene was ubiquitously expressed in human tissues
as 2 mRNA species of 2.6 and 3.4 kb, although in some tissues and cell
lines, only the larger mRNA was detected.

GENE FUNCTION

CSK downregulates tyrosine kinase activity of the SRC oncoprotein
(190090) through tyrosine phosphorylation of the SRC carboxy terminus.
Since cell transformation by SRC oncoproteins is caused by various
mechanisms that interfere with this phosphorylation, the CSK gene might
function as an antioncogene (Armstrong et al., 1992).

Cloutier and Veillette (1996) used the yeast 2-hybrid system to identify
proteins associated with CSK. They found that the Src homology-3 (SH3)
domain of CSK associates with a proline-rich region of PEP (600716), a
protein-tyrosine phosphatase expressed in hemopoietic cells. Cloutier
and Veillette (1996) showed that this association is highly specific and
speculated that PEP may be an effector and/or regulator of CSK in T
cells and other hemopoietic cells.

MAPPING

Armstrong et al. (1992) used in situ hybridization to map the CSK gene
to 15q23-q25.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Associations Pending Confirmation

CSK physically interacts with the intracellular phosphatase LYP (PTPN22;
600716) and can modify the activation state of downstream Src kinases,
such as LYN (165120), in lymphocytes. Manjarrez-Orduno et al. (2012)
identified an association of CSK with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE;
152700) and refined its location to the intronic polymorphism dbSNP
rs34933034 (odds ratio = 1.32; p = 1.04 x 10(-9)). The risk allele at
this SNP is associated with increased CSK expression and augments
inhibitory phosphorylation of LYN. In carriers of the risk allele, there
is increased B-cell receptor-mediated activation of mature B cells, as
well as higher concentrations of plasma IgM, relative to individuals in
the nonrisk haplotype. Moreover, the fraction of transitional B cells is
doubled in the cord blood of carriers of the risk allele, due to an
expansion of late transitional cells in a stage targeted by selection
mechanisms. Manjarrez-Orduno et al. (2012) concluded that their results
suggested that the LYP-CSK complex increases susceptibility to lupus at
multiple maturation and activation points in B cells.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lowry et al. (2002) found that actin stress fiber formation induced by G
proteins and G protein receptors was completely blocked in Csk-deficient
mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Reintroduction of Csk into Csk-deficient
cells restored G protein-induced actin stress fiber formation. Rescue
experiments with catalytic mutants of Csk demonstrated that Csk
catalytic activity was required for stress fiber formation. Lowry et al.
(2002) found that G-beta (see GNB1; 139380)/G-gamma (see GNG2; 606981)
dimers translocated Csk to the plasma membrane and directly increased
Csk kinase activity. They concluded that CSK plays a critical role in
mediating G protein signals in the reorganization of the actin
cytoskeleton.

614531	TITLE *614531 RASGEF DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 1A; RASGEF1A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RAS proteins (see HRAS; 190020) are small GTPases that are
interconvertible between an active GTP-bound form and an inactive
GDP-bound form. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), such as
RASGEF1A, induce release of GDP, permitting reloading of GTP onto RAS
and activation of cell signaling (Ura et al., 2006).

CLONING

Using microarray analysis to identify genes upregulated in intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma, Ura et al. (2006) identified RASGEF1A. The deduced
protein contains a RASGEF domain and a RAS exchange motif, and it shares
30% and 29% identity with PDZGEF2 (RAPGEF6; 610499) and PDZGEF1
(RAPGEF2; 609530), respectively. Northern blot analysis detected a
transcript of about 3.3 kb that was moderately expressed in brain and
spinal cord and weakly expressed in lymph node and adrenal gland, but
not in any of 19 other tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Ura et al. (2006) found that recombinant RASGEF1A stimulated
radiolabeled GDP dissociation from KRAS (190070), HRAS, and NRAS
(164790). In transfected COS-7 cells, exogenous RASGEF1A activated Ras,
which increased its affinity for Raf1 (164760). Overexpression of
RASGEF1A in COS-7 cells increased cell migration, but it had no effect
on colony-forming ability. Knockdown of RASGEF1A via small interfering
RNA reduced cell growth of COS-7 and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
cells.

Yaman et al. (2009) presented evidence that RASGEF1A and RASGEF1B
(614532) function as specific GEFs for RAP2 (RAP2A; 179540), but not for
RAP1 (RAP1A; 179520) or other members of the RAS family.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the RASGEF1A gene to chromosome 10q11.21 based on an
alignment of the RASGEF1A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK095136) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

164873	TITLE *164873 ETS VARIANT GENE 3; ETV3
;;ONCOGENE PE1; PE1;;
MITOGENIC ETS TRANSCRIPTIONAL SUPPRESSOR; METS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The ETS oncogene (164720) was first described as part of a fusion gene
transduced by the avian retrovirus E26. In E26, v-ets and v-myb (189990)
were fused to a portion of GAG to form the transforming gene. The ETS
oncogene family shares a conserved peptide motif called the ETS domain
that mediates sequence-specific DNA binding. This motif is unique among
transcription factor families. Using partially degenerate
oligonucleotides from conserved regions of the ETS domain and the
polymerase chain reaction, Klemsz et al. (1994) isolated a new member of
the ETS family, designated PE1, from HL60 cells. The PE1 gene was
expressed as an approximately 5-kb transcript in most cell lines tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Klappacher et al. (2002) described a mechanism in which induction of the
ETS repressor METS links terminal differentiation to cell cycle arrest.
Using macrophages as a model, they provided evidence that METS blocks
RAS (190020)-dependent proliferation without inhibiting RAS-dependent
expression of cell type-specific genes by selectively replacing ETS
activators on the promoters of cell cycle control genes. The
antiproliferative effects of METS required its interaction with DP103
(DDX20; 606168), a DEAD box-containing protein that assembles a novel
corepressor complex. Functional interactions between the METS/DP103
complex and E2F (see 189971)/RB1 (614041) family proteins were also
necessary for inhibition of cellular proliferation, suggesting a
combinatorial code that directs permanent cell cycle exit during
terminal differentiation.

MAPPING

Using both in situ hybridization and study of human/hamster cell
hybrids, Klemsz et al. (1994) demonstrated that the PE1 gene is located
on 1q21-q23.

NUCLEOSIDE DIPHOSPHATE KINASE 7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In a review of human Nm23/nucleoside diphosphate kinases (EC 2.7.4.6),
Lacombe et al. (2000) stated that the NME7 gene encodes a deduced
376-amino acid protein containing 2 kinase-like domains, each of which
lacks 3 residues deemed crucial for catalysis. RT-PCR detected highest
NME7 expression in testis, and weaker expression in liver, heart, brain,
ovary, small intestine, and spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

Hutchins et al. (2010) showed that mouse Nme7 associated with the
centralspindlin complex (see KIF23, 605064) in transfected HeLa cells.
This complex is believed to have a role in spindle assembly and
cytokinesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lacombe et al. (2000) determined that the NME7 gene contains 12 exons
spanning over 180 kb.

MAPPING

Lacombe et al. (2000) mapped the NME7 gene to chromosome 1q24. They
noted that NME7 and ATP1B1 (182330) lie on opposite strands, with
overlapping 3-prime UTRs.

611135	TITLE *611135 KLOTHO, BETA; KLB
;;BETA-KLOTHO; BKL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of Klotho (KL; 604824), Ito et al.
(2000) identified a partial human cDNA encoding KLB. They cloned
full-length mouse Klb and found that it encodes a 1,043-amino acid
protein that shares 41.2% identity with mouse Kl. Like Kl, Klb contains
an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by 2 tandemly repeated
glycosidase-like domains, a C-terminal transmembrane domain, and a short
cytoplasmic tail. Both Kl and Klb lack 2 key glutamates in the predicted
active centers of the glycosidase-like domains. Northern blot analysis
of adult mouse tissues showed that Klb was predominantly expressed in
liver and pancreas, with lower levels in skin and weak expression in
stomach, skeletal muscle, small intestine, and lung. In mouse embryos,
Klb expression became detectable at day 11 and increased in intensity as
development progressed. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos revealed
strong Klb expression in yolk sac, gut, brown and white adipose tissue,
liver, and pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Ogawa et al. (2007) noted that FGF23 (605380) requires KL to bind FGFRs
and activate FGF signaling in various cell types. Using immunoblot
analysis, they found that human embryonic kidney cells overexpressing
KLB, but not those overexpressing KL, responded to FGF21 (609436).
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that FGF21 required KLB to bind
FGFR1c (136350) and FGFR4 (134935). FGF21 stimulated glucose uptake in
adipocytes, which Ogawa et al. (2007) found expressed KLB, but not in
preadipocytes, which did not express KLB. Small interfering RNA-mediated
knockdown of KLB in adipocytes abolished the effect of FGF21 on glucose
uptake. Mice injected with Fgf21 displayed Erk1 (MAPK3; 601795)/Erk2
(MAPK1; 176948) phosphorylation in white adipose tissue, which expressed
Klb, but not in kidney or skeletal muscle, which did not express Klb.
Phosphorylation in kidney, which expressed Kl, occurred only in response
to Fgf23. Ogawa et al. (2007) concluded that KLB is an essential
cofactor for FGF21 activity and suggested that the Klotho gene family
may have evolved to confer tissue-specific bioactivity on FGF19 (603891)
subfamily members.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ito et al. (2000) mapped the KLB gene to
chromosome 4.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ito et al. (2005) found that Klb -/- mice were viable, fertile, and
appeared grossly normal, although they had slightly decreased body
weight compared with wildtype and heterozygous mice. Klb -/- mice showed
dramatically elevated synthesis and secretion of bile acids and strong
upregulation of 2 key bile acid synthase genes, Cyp7a1 (118455) and
Cyp8b1 (602172). Nuclear receptor pathways and enterohepatic
circulation, which regulates bile acid synthesis, were largely intact,
but bile acid-dependent induction of Nr0b2 (604630), a negative
regulator of Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1, was significantly attenuated.
Suppression of Cyp7a1 expression by dietary bile acids was impaired in
Klb -/- mice, whereas that of Cyp8b1 expression was not significantly
altered. Ito et al. (2005) concluded that KLB may contribute to
CYP7A1-selective regulation. In addition, Klb -/- mice exhibited
resistance to gallstone formation, suggesting a potential clinical
relevance of the KLB system.

RETINAL DEGENERATION GENE B, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, ALPHA; RDGBA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PITPNM1 belongs to a family of membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol
transfer domain-containing proteins that share homology with the
Drosophila retinal degeneration B (rdgB) protein (Ocaka et al., 2005).

CLONING

The Drosophila rdgB gene encodes a 116-kD transmembrane protein
expressed in the eye and central nervous system (CNS). Mutations in rdgB
cause light-induced retinal degeneration (Vihtelic et al., 1991). By
screening an EST database for homologs of Drosophila rdgB, followed by
probing a teratocarcinoma/neuron cDNA library, Rubboli et al. (1997)
obtained a full-length cDNA encoding human PITPNM1, which they called
DRES9. The predicted 1,242-amino acid PITPNM1 protein shares 96% and 66%
amino acid identity with mouse Pitpnm1 and Drosophila rdgB,
respectively. Northern blot analysis showed ubiquitous expression of a
4.4-kb PITPNM1 transcript, with highest levels in brain, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and heart. In situ hybridization analysis of murine
embryo tissues at various developmental stages revealed high Pitpnm1
expression in the neural retina and in the CNS.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to bovine rdgB, Chang
et al. (1997) identified partial human PITPNM1 sequences, which they
used to obtain genomic clones. The deduced 1,059-amino acid protein
shares 92% identity with mouse Pitpnm1, with highest similarity in the
N- and C-terminal regions. Northern blot analysis indicated that bovine
and mouse Pitpnm1 were expressed strongly in retina and more weakly in
brain, but not in any other tissue examined. In situ hybridization of
mouse retina detected Pitpnm1 mRNA in photoreceptors and the inner
nuclear layer. Immunocytochemistry detected Pitpnm1 in photoreceptors,
particularly in the inner segments and the outer plexiform layer, the
inner plexiform layer, and possibly the ganglion cell layer.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a brain cDNA library, Lev et al. (1999)
cloned PITPNM1, which they called NIR2, as one of a family of proteins
that interact with the tyrosine kinase PYK2 (PTK2B; 601212). The deduced
1,244-amino acid PITPNM1 protein shares structural domains with other
family members, including an N-terminal phosphatidylinositol (PI)
transfer domain, an acidic calcium-binding region, 6 transmembrane
domains, and a conserved C-terminal domain. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression of PITPNM1, with highest levels in brain,
heart, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Chang et al. (1997) demonstrated the mouse Pitpnm1 fully rescued the
rdgB-dependent retinal degeneration and abnormal electroretinogram in
flies.

Lev et al. (1999) determined that the C terminus of PITPNM1 bound PYK2.
Analysis of PITPNM1 or PYK2 immunoprecipitates of cells coexpressing
PITPNM1 and PYK2 demonstrated that both proteins were tyrosine
phosphorylated. Agonists known to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of
PYK2 also induced strong phosphorylation of PITPNM1, and both proteins
were associated in a stable complex. Chang et al. (1997) concluded that
PITPNM1 is a direct or indirect substrate for PYK2 tyrosine
phosphorylation.

Tian et al. (2002) showed that PITPNM1 contains a novel N-terminal Rho
(see RhoA; 165390)-inhibitory domain (RID) that binds to GDP-bound Rho.
Ectopic expression of the PITPNM1 RID domain caused loss of F-actin
staining and inhibited Rho-mediated stress fiber formation and
lysophosphatidic acid-induced RhoA activation. Expression of the RID
domain along with the PI transfer domain removed these effects. Blocking
of PITPNM1 function by PITPNM1 antibody injection reduced neurite
extension in neuronal cells, while PITPNM1 overexpression reduced
Rho-mediated neurite retraction.

Litvak et al. (2002) showed that PITPNM1 is essential for cytokinesis.
PITPNM1 localized to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis, and
blocking of PITPNM1 function by PITPNM1 antibody injection caused
multinucleate cell formation. Overexpression of a deletion construct
lacking the N-terminal RID and PI domains caused specific blockage of
cytokinesis. Overexpression of the RID domain of PITPNM1 caused abnormal
cytokinesis, resulting in formation of a long bridge-like structure
between putative daughter cells. Coimmunoprecipitation showed that
PITPNM1 bound to RhoA in mitotic cells, and confocal microscopy showed
the 2 proteins localized together at the cleavage furrow during cell
division.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chang et al. (1997) determined that the PITPNM1 gene contains 21 exons
and spans about 12 kb. Ocaka et al. (2005) determined that the PITPNM1
gene contains 23 exons and spans approximately 13 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Chang et al. (1997) mapped the PITPNM1 gene to chromosome
11q13.1. They mapped the mouse Pitpnm1 gene to a proximal region of
chromosome 19 that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome
11q13.1.

613288	TITLE *613288 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 72; TRIM72
;;MITSUGUMIN, 53-KD; MG53
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cai et al. (2009) cloned mouse Trim72, which they called Mg53, from a
skeletal muscle cDNA library. By database analysis, they identified
human MG53. Both the mouse and human proteins contain 477 amino acids
and have an N-terminal tripartite motif consisting of RING, B-box, and
coiled-coil domains, followed by a C-terminal SPRY domain. Northern and
Western blot analyses of mouse tissues detected Mg53 RNA and protein
only in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Fluorescence-tagged Mg53 and
endogenous Mg53 localized to the sarcolemmal membrane and intracellular
vesicles of mouse skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Cai et al. (2009) showed that overexpression of Mg53 increased vesicular
trafficking and plasma membrane fusion events in C2C12 mouse myogenic
cells. Scrape-wounding of C2C12 cells resulted in dense accumulation of
fluorescence-tagged Mg53 at the site of membrane damage, and this
accumulation required Mg53 oligomerization and was associated with
nucleation of vesicles into a membrane patch. Oligomerization of Mg53
required oxidation of cys242, and interaction of Mg53 with
phosphatidylserine mediated recruitment of vesicles to sites of injury.
Translocation of fluorescence-tagged Mg53 to sites of injury showed both
Ca(2+)-dependent and -independent components.

Zhu et al. (2011) showed that mouse Mg53 and Ptrf (603198) interacted
with each other and functioned together in muscle membrane repair. Ptrf
was required for the translocation of Mg53 to the site of membrane
injury in cell culture models and in mice irradiated with a UV laser to
cause localized sarcolemma damage. A mouse mutant ortholog of the PTRF
525delG mutation (603198.0002) resulted in mislocalization of Ptrf to
the nucleus in transfected human cell lines. Consequently, mutant Ptrf
was unable to target Mg53 to the plasma membrane for repair of
detergent-induced membrane damage. The authors also showed that
cholesterol, which is exposed during membrane damage, was critical for
membrane repair. Cholesterol, bound by Ptrf, functioned as a nucleation
site for the recruitment of Mg53-containing vesicles. Zhu et al. (2011)
hypothesized that, upon cell membrane disruption, PTRF recognizes
exposed cholesterol at the site of injury and tethers MG53 and its
associated intracellular vesicles to the damage site, allowing formation
of a membrane repair patch.

Song et al. (2013) showed in mice that muscle-specific Mg53 mediates the
degradation of the insulin receptor (147670) and insulin receptor
substrate-1 (IRS1; 147545), and when upregulated causes metabolic
syndrome featuring insulin resistance, obesity, hypertension, and
dyslipidemia. Mg53 expression is markedly elevated in models of insulin
resistance, and Mg53 overexpression suffices to trigger muscle insulin
resistance and metabolic syndrome sequentially. Conversely, ablation of
Mg53 prevents diet-induced metabolic syndrome by preserving the insulin
receptor, Irs1, and insulin signaling integrity. Mechanistically, Mg53
acts as an E3 ligase targeting the insulin receptor and Irs1 for
ubiquitin-dependent degradation, comprising a central mechanism
controlling insulin signal strength in skeletal muscle. Song et al.
(2013) concluded that these findings defined MG53 as a novel therapeutic
target for treating metabolic disorders and associated cardiovascular
complications.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cai et al. (2009) determined that the TRIM72 gene contains 6 coding
exons.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Cai et al., 2009 determined that the TRIM72 gene
maps to chromosome 16p11.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Cai et al. (2009) found that Mg53 -/- mice were viable until at least 11
months of age. However, Mg53 -/- mice developed progressive skeletal
muscle pathology, with increased number of central nuclei in myotubes,
decreased diameter of muscle fibers, and compromised contractile
function. Skeletal muscle pathology was exacerbated by exercise stress
in Mg53 -/- muscle and involved susceptibility to skeletal muscle
membrane injury. Primary cultures of wildtype muscle could reseal
sarcolemmal membranes following puncture wounding, but Mg53 -/- muscle
could not, resulting in Ca(2+)-induced contraction. Electron microscopy
revealed limited recruitment of vesicles to damaged sarcolemma in Mg53
-/- mice. The defect in membrane repair in Mg53 -/- muscle appeared to
be upstream of a Ca(2+)-dependent membrane-resealing process.

112262	TITLE *112262 BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN 4; BMP4
;;BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN 2B; BMP2B;;
BMP2B1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BMP4 is a vital regulatory molecule that functions throughout
development in mesoderm induction, tooth development, limb formation,
bone induction, and fracture repair. BMP4 is a member of the BMP family
and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFB1; 190180) superfamily of
secretory signaling molecules that play essential roles in embryonic
development (summary by Bakrania et al., 2008).

CLONING

Bakrania et al. (2008) stated that the BMP4 protein is 408 amino acids
long and consists of a TGFB1 propeptide domain and a TGFB domain that
forms an active dimer.

GENE STRUCTURE

The transcriptional unit of the human BMP4 gene is encoded by 5 exons
and spans approximately 7 kb (van den Wijngaard et al., 1996). The human
BMP4 gene has at least 2 functional promoters, which are used in a cell
type-specific manner.

Shore et al. (1998) determined that alternate first exons may be used
and that the first 2 exons are untranslated. The promoter region is
GC-rich and contains no obvious TATA or CAAT consensus sequences. Both
positive and negative transcriptional regulatory elements are contained
within the 5-prime flanking region.

Bakrania et al. (2008) stated that the BMP4 gene contains 4 exons. The
first 2 exons are noncoding.

MAPPING

Dickinson et al. (1990) demonstrated that in the mouse the Bmp2b1 gene
is located on chromosome 14 and maps to the same area as 'pug nose'
(pn). The mutation in that disorder may reside in the Bmp2b1 gene.
Arguing from homology of synteny, Dickinson et al. (1990) suggested that
the human BMP2B1 gene may be located on chromosome 14. Furthermore, they
suggested that a human homolog of the murine Bmp2b2 gene resides on the
X chromosome, as it does in the mouse. There is, however, no direct
evidence of a second BMP2B gene in the human (McAlpine, 1992).

By analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids, Tabas et al. (1993)
assigned the BMP4 gene to human chromosome 14. Using fluorescence in
situ hybridization, van den Wijngaard et al. (1995) localized the BMP4
gene to 14q22-q23. By FISH, Shore et al. (1998) mapped the BMP4 gene to
chromosome 14q21, a region more centromeric than previously reported.

GENE FUNCTION

Shafritz et al. (1996) found overexpression of BMP4 in lymphoblastoid
cell lines from 26 of 32 patients with FOP (135100), but from only 1 of
12 normal subjects (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, BMP4 and its mRNA
were detected in the lymphoblastoid cell lines from a man with FOP and
his 3 affected children, but not from the children's unaffected mother.
Cosegregation of DNA markers for the BMP4 locus on chromosome 14 in the
rare families in which FOP is inherited would strengthen the candidacy
of BMP4, and the demonstration of mutations in the BMP4 gene, especially
in the promoter sequences, would be confirmatory.

In a series of expression studies in mouse, Tucker et al. (1998)
demonstrated that BMP4 activates the expression of Msx1 (142983),
leading to incisor tooth development. BMP4 inhibited expression of Barx1
(603260), which marks presumptive molar teeth, and limits expression to
the proximal, presumptive molar mesenchyme at embryonic day 10.
Fibroblast growth factor-8 (FGF8; 600483) stimulated Barx1 expression.
When BMP4 signaling in early development was inhibited by application of
exogenous noggin (NOG; 602991) protein, ectopic Barx1 expression
resulted in transformation of tooth identity from incisor to molar.

Dlx1 (600029) and Dlx2 (126255) are involved in the patterning of murine
dentition, since loss of these transcription factors results in early
developmental failure in upper molar teeth. Thomas et al. (2000) found
that Bmp4 was coexpressed with Dlx2 in distal oral epithelium and that
it regulated Dlx2 expression by planar signaling. They presented
evidence that Bmp4 and Fgf8 cooperate and regulate the strict expression
of Dlx2 in the epithelium and the mesenchyme in the first branchial arch
in developing mice.

Dooley et al. (2000) investigated the effect of BMP4 on androgen
production in a human ovarian theca-like tumor (HOTT) cell culture
model. BMP4 decreased forskolin-stimulated HOTT cell secretion of
androstenedione and 17-alphahydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) by 50% but
increased progesterone production 3-fold above forskolin treatment
alone. BMP4 markedly inhibited forskolin stimulation of CYP17 (609300)
expression but had little effect on 3-beta-HSD (see 109715), CYP11A1
(118485), or STAR (600617) protein levels. The authors identified the
presence of mRNA for 3 BMP receptors in the HOTT cells model: BMPR1A
(601299), BMPR1B (603248), and BMPR2 (600799). The authors concluded
that BMP4 inhibits HOTT cell expression of CYP17, leading to an
alteration of the steroidogenic pathway resulting in reduced
androstenedione accumulation and increased progesterone production. They
also noted that the effects of BMP4 seem similar to those caused by
activin (see 147290), another member of the transforming growth
factor-beta (TGFB; see 190180) superfamily of proteins.

In chick embryos, the first signs of left-right asymmetry are detected
in Hensen's node, essentially by left-sided Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725)
expression. After a gap of several hours, Shh induces polarized gene
activities in the left paraxial mesoderm. Monsoro-Burq and Le Douarin
(2001) showed that during this time period, Bmp4 signaling is necessary
and sufficient to maintain Shh asymmetry within the node. Shh and Bmp4
proteins negatively regulate each other's transcription, resulting in a
strict complementarity between these 2 gene patterns on each side of the
node. Noggin, which is present in the midline at this stage, limits Bmp4
spreading. Moreover, Bmp4 is downstream to activin signals and controls
Fgf8. Thus, the authors concluded that early Bmp4 signaling coordinates
left and right pathways in Hensen's node.

Chen et al. (2002) studied BMP4 gene transfer and osteoinduction by BMP4
using an adenoviral vector to transduce mouse myoblast cells. BMP4
expressed by transduced myoblasts was located in the cytoplasm, and the
differentiation pathway utilized by these cells was converted from a
myogenic to an osteogenic pathway. Injection of the adenoviral vector
carrying BMP4 into the hindlimb muscles of male athymic nude rats
resulted in new bone formation that could be visualized on x-ray films
as early as 3 weeks post injection. Histologic staining of bone tissue
revealed a typical remodeled bone structure.

Cheng et al. (2003) measured the ability of 14 human BMPs to induce
osteogenic transformation in a mouse pluripotential stem cell line, a
mouse mesenchymal stem cell line, and a mature human osteoblastic cell
line. Osteogenic activity was determined by measuring induction of
alkaline phosphatase (see 171760), osteocalcin (112260), and matrix
mineralization upon BMP stimulation. All BMPs except BMP3 (112263) and
BMP12 (604651) were able to stimulate alkaline phosphatase activity in
the mature osteoblasts. BMP4 was able to induce all markers of
osteoblast differentiation in pluripotential and mesenchymal stem cells;
however, BMP4 was a weaker inducer than BMP2 (112261), BMP6 (112266),
and BMP9 (GDF2; 605120).

Paez-Pereda et al. (2003) stated that there is little doubt that
estrogens and growth factors are involved in the control of lactotroph
cell proliferation in the pituitary and that the tumorigenic action of
estrogen in prolactinomas had been demonstrated by in vitro and clinical
evidence. Thus, the number of lactotroph cells increases during
pregnancy. Prolactinomas occur more frequently in women and increase in
size during pregnancy or estrogen treatment, and, at least in human
prolactinomas, estrogen receptor expression is positively related to
size. Paez-Pereda et al. (2003) reported a previously undescribed
mechanism for prolactinoma growth that involved BMP4, SMAD4 (600993),
and estrogens.

By in situ hybridization, Zhu et al. (2004) found overlapping expression
of Bmp4 and Nkx2.1 (600635) in embryonic mouse lung. They presented
evidence that Nkx2.1 activated Bmp4 transcription through 2 Nkx2.1
elements in each of the 2 Bmp4 promoters.

Haramis et al. (2004) used mouse models to demonstrate that BMP4
expression occurs exclusively in the intravillus mesenchyme of the
intestine. Villus epithelial cells respond to the BMP signal. Inhibition
of BMP signaling by transgenic expression of noggin results in the
formation of numerous ectopic crypt units perpendicular to the
crypt-villus axis. These changes phenocopy the intestinal histopathology
of patients with the cancer predisposition syndrome juvenile polyposis
(174900), including the frequent occurrence of intraepithelial
neoplasia. Many juvenile polyposis cases are known to harbor mutations
in BMP pathway genes. Haramis et al. (2004) concluded that their data
indicated that intestinal BMP signaling represses de novo crypt
formation and polyp growth.

The mouse C3H10T1/2 stem cell line can be induced to differentiate into
adipocytes by exposing proliferating cells to BMP4 during a specific
time window prior to induction of differentiation (Tang et al., 2004).
Bowers et al. (2006) identified a subclone of these cells, the A33 cell
line, that was committed to the adipocyte lineage. A33 cells expressed
and secreted Bmp4 during the critical time point in the proliferative
stage. Inhibition of Bmp4 activity by the addition of noggin at the
critical time blocked the ability of A33 cells to differentiate into
adipocytes.

Piccirillo et al. (2006) reported that bone morphogenetic proteins,
among which BMP4 elicits the strongest effect, trigger a significant
reduction in the stem-like, tumor-initiating precursors of human
glioblastomas. Transient in vitro exposure to BMP4 abolished the
capacity of transplanted glioblastoma cells to establish intracerebral
glioblastomas. Most importantly, in vivo delivery of BMP4 effectively
blocked the tumor growth and associated mortality that occurred in 100%
of mice after intracerebral grafting of human glioblastoma cells.
Piccirillo et al. (2006) demonstrated that BMPs activate their cognate
receptor BMPRs and trigger the SMAD signaling cascade in cells isolated
from human glioblastomas. This is followed by a reduction in
proliferation, and increased expression of markers of neural
differentiation, with no effect on cell viability. The concomitant
reduction in clonogenic ability, in the size of the CD133
(604365)-positive population, and in the growth kinetics of glioblastoma
cells indicated that BMP4 reduces the tumor-initiating cell pool of
glioblastomas. These findings showed that the BMP-BMPR signaling
system--which controls the activity of normal brainstem cells--may also
act as a key inhibitory regulator of tumor-initiating, stem-like cells
from glioblastomas and the results also identified BMP4 as a novel,
noncytotoxic therapeutic effector, which may be used to prevent growth
and recurrence of glioblastomas in humans.

Wordinger et al. (2007) studied the effects of altered BMP signaling on
intraocular pressure (IOP) in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG; see
137760). They found that the human trabecular meshwork (TM) synthesized
and secreted BMP4 as well as expressed the BMP receptor subtypes BMPR1
(see BMPR1A; 601299) and BMPR2 (600799). TM cells responded to exogenous
BMP4 by phosphorylating SMAD signaling proteins. Cultured human TM cells
treated with TGFB2 significantly increased fibronectin (FN; 135600)
levels, and BMP4 blocked this FN induction. There was significant
elevation of mRNA and protein levels of the BMP antagonist Gremlin
(GREM1; 603054) in glaucomatous TM cells. In addition, Gremlin was
present in human aqueous humor. Gremlin blocked the negative effect of
BMP4 on TGFB2 induction of FN. Addition of recombinant Gremlin to the
medium of ex vivo perfusion-cultured human eye anterior segments caused
the glaucoma phenotype of elevated IOP. Wordinger et al. (2007)
concluded that these results were consistent with the hypothesis that,
in POAG, elevated expression of Gremlin by TM cells inhibited BMP4
antagonism of TGFB2 and led to increased extracellular matrix deposition
and elevated IOP.

Using RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometric analyses, Cejalvo
et al. (2007) demonstrated that human thymus and cortical epithelial
cells produced BMP2 and BMP4 and that both thymocytes and thymic
epithelium expressed the molecular machinery to respond to these
proteins. The receptors BMPR1A and BMPR2 were mainly expressed by
cortical thymocytes, whereas BMPR1B was expressed in the majority of
thymocytes. BMP4 treatment of chimeric human-mouse fetal thymic organ
cultures seeded with CD34 (142230)-positive human thymic progenitors
resulted in reduced cell recovery and inhibition of differentiation of
CD4 (186940)/CD8 (see 186910) double-negative to double-positive stages.
Cejalvo et al. (2007) concluded that BMP2 and BMP4 have a role in human
T-cell differentiation.

A hair follicle cycles through anagen (growth), catagen (involution),
and telogen (resting) phases and then reenters the anagen phase. Plikus
et al. (2008) demonstrated that unexpected periodic expression of BMP2
and BMP4 in the dermis regulates the process of hair follicle
regeneration. This BMP cycle is out of phase with the WNT/beta catenin
cycle (see 116806), thus dividing the conventional telogen into new
functional phases: one refractory and the other competent for hair
regeneration, characterized by high and low BMP signaling, respectively.
Overexpression of noggin (602991), a BMP antagonist, in mouse skin
resulted in a markedly shortened refractory phase and faster propagation
of the regenerative wave. Transplantation of skin from this mutant onto
a wildtype host showed that follicles and donor and host can affect
their cycling behaviors mutually, with the outcome depending on the
equilibrium of BMP activity in the dermis. Administration of BMP4
protein caused the competent region to become refractory. The existence
of a substance termed 'chalone' had been proposed to explain the
phenomenon of telogen refractivity, which can inhibit anagen
development. Plikus et al. (2008) suggested that BMPs may be the
long-sought chalone postulated by classical experiments. Plikus et al.
(2008) concluded that, taken together, the results presented in this
study provided an example of hierarchical regulation of local organ stem
cell homeostasis by the interorgan macroenvironment. The expression of
Bmp2 in subcutaneous adipocytes indicates physiologic integration
between the 2 thermoregulatory organs.

Using in situ hybridization in human embryos, Bakrania et al. (2008)
authors demonstrated expression of BMP4 in optic vesicle, developing
lens, the diencephalic floor, consistent with a role in pituitary
development, and in the interdigital mesenchyme and the joint primordium
at the stage at which limb buds have formed and are starting to
differentiate into fingers. Because BMP4 interacts with hedgehog
signaling genes in animals, Bakrania et al. (2008) evaluated gene
expression in embryos and demonstrated cotemporal and cospatial
expression of BMP4 and hedgehog signaling genes.

Wang et al. (2008) demonstrated binding between human full-length
triple-helical type IV collagen (see 120130) and BMP4. Based on
experiments in Drosophila, Wang et al. (2008) predicted that a conserved
sequence in type IV collagen functions as a BMP-binding module, and that
type IV collagens affect BMP signaling during vertebrate development.

Limb development is regulated by epithelial-mesenchymal feedback loops
between sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)
signaling involving the bone morphogenetic protein antagonist Grem1. By
combining mouse molecular genetics with mathematical modeling, Benazet
et al. (2009) showed that BMP4 first initiates and SHH then propagates
epithelial-mesenchymal feedback signaling through differential
transcriptional regulation of Grem1 to control digit specification. This
switch occurs by linking a fast BMP4/GREM1 module to the slower
SHH/GREM1/FGF epithelial-mesenchymal feedback loop. This self-regulatory
signaling network results in robust regulation of distal limb
development that is able to compensate for variations by
interconnectivity among the 3 signaling pathways.

Wandzioch and Zaret (2009) investigated how BMP4, transforming growth
factor-beta (TGF-beta; 190180), and fibroblast growth factor signaling
pathways converge on the earliest genes that elicit pancreas and liver
induction in mouse embryos. These genes include ALB1 (103600), PROX1
(601546), HNF6 (604164), HNF1B (189907), and PDX1 (600733). The
inductive network was found to be dynamic; it changed within hours.
Different signals functioned in parallel to induce different early
genes, and 2 permutations of signals induced liver progenitor domains,
which revealed flexibility in cell programming. Also, the specification
of pancreas and liver progenitors was restricted by the TGF-beta
pathway.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bakrania et al. (2008) considered BMP4 as a candidate gene for ocular
malformation and digit anomalies (MCOPS6; 607932) and screened 215
individuals with ocular defects, mainly microphthalmia, for cytogenetic
defects by chromosomal analysis, for gene deletions by multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and for mutations in the
BMP4 gene by direct sequencing. They identified 2 individuals with a
14q22-q23 deletion associated with anophthalmia-microphthalmia, 1 with
associated pituitary anomaly. Sequence analysis of the BMP4 gene
identified 2 mutations: a frameshift mutation (112262.0001) in a family
with anophthalmia-microphthalmia, retinal dystrophy, myopia, poly-
and/or syndactyly, and brain anomalies, and a missense mutation
(112262.0002) in an individual with anophthalmia-microphthalmia and
brain anomalies. The finding of expression of BMP4 in developing human
optic vesicle, retina and lens, pituitary region, and digits strongly
supported BMP4 as a causative gene for anophthalmia-microphthalmia with
pituitary abnormalities and digit anomalies. Bakrania et al. (2008) also
identified 4 cases, some of which had retinal dystrophy, with 'low
penetrant' mutations in both BMP4 and hedgehog signaling genes, namely,
Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) or Patched (PTCH1; 601309). Bakrania et al.
(2008) concluded that BMP4 is a major gene for
anophthalmia-microphthalmia and/or retinal dystrophy and brain anomalies
and may be a candidate for myopia and poly/syndactyly. The finding of
low-penetrant variants of BMP4 and hedgehog signaling partners suggested
an interaction between the 2 pathways in humans.

Suzuki et al. (2009) identified mutations in the BMP4 gene (see, e.g.,
112262.0003-112262.0005 and 112262.0007) in patients with cleft lip and
cleft palate (OFC11; 600625). The parents, who also carried the
mutation, had subtle defects in the orbicularis oris muscle on
ultrasound. Overall, BMP4 mutations were identified in 1 of 30 patients
with microform clefts, 2 of 87 patients with subepithelial defects in
the orbicularis oris muscle, and 5 of 968 patients with overt cleft
lip/palate (CL/P). These results indicated that microforms and
subepithelial defects in the orbicularis oris muscle are part of the
spectrum of CL/P and should be considered during the clinical evaluation
of families with clefts.

Reis et al. (2011) analyzed the BMP4 coding region in 133 patients with
various ocular conditions, including 60 with clinical
anophthalmia/microphthalmia (34 syndromic), 38 with anterior segment
anomalies (including 3 patients with SHORT syndrome, 269880), 16 with
cataract, 4 with coloboma, 5 with high myopia, and 10 with other
disorders. In 1 patient with SHORT syndrome, they identified a
heterozygous 2.263-Mb deletion encompassing BMP4 and 13 other genes. In
3 probands with syndromic microphthalmia, they identified heterozygosity
for a 158-kb deletion involving only the BMP4 gene (112262.0006), a
nonsense mutation (R198X; 122262.0007), and a frameshift mutation
(112262.0008), respectively; the affected sister of the proband with the
frameshift mutation carried both the frameshift and a missense mutation
(H121R; 112262.0009).

ANIMAL MODEL

Connor (1996) speculated that transgenic mice with selective
overexpression of Bmp4 may serve as animal models of fibrodysplasia
ossificans progressiva (FOP; 135100) and may make it possible to
evaluate potential therapies directed at influencing the expression of
BMP4 or its 2 types of cell-surface receptors. Not only may this
knowledge provide a rational basis for therapy for FOP, but possibly
also measures for the control of local ectopic bone development, which
occurs in 10 to 20% of patients who have undergone surgical hip
replacement. According to Connor (1996), there appears to be an
individual propensity to the phenomenon of secondary ectopic
ossification of soft tissue. In the 10 to 20% of patients who develop
local ectopic bone formation after hip replacement, if surgical removal
of that bone is attempted or the opposite hip is replaced, ectopic bone
almost invariably recurs or occurs.

Furuta and Hogan, (1998) showed that Bmp4, which is expressed strongly
in the mouse optic vesicle and weakly in surrounding mesenchyme and
surface ectoderm, plays a crucial role in lens induction. In Bmp4-null
mouse embryos, lens induction was absent but could be rescued by
exogenous BMP4 protein applied into the optic vesicle in explant
cultures. In Bmp4-null embryos, Msx2 (123101) expression was absent, and
expression mutant eye explants was rescued by BMP4-carrying beads,
suggesting that BMP4 functions to regulate specific gene expression in
the optic vesicle. No change in Pax6 (607108) was detected in Bmp4-null
eyes.

Using a hypomorphic Bmp4 allele and conditional gene inactivation, Jiao
et al. (2003) circumvented the early lethality of Bmp4 null mouse
embryos and manipulated Bmp4 expression specifically in developing
cardiomyocytes. They found that Bmp4 was dispensable for cushion
formation but was required for proper atrioventricular septation after
cushions had formed. Defects in septation caused atrioventricular canal
defects (AVCD; 600309) that recapitulated the range of AVCDs diagnosed
in patients.

Kan et al. (2004) generated mice overexpressing BMP4 under the control
of the neuron-specific enolase promoter (ENO2; 131360) and observed the
development of progressive postnatal heterotopic endochondral
ossification, a phenotype that matches the anatomic, spatial, and
temporal characteristics of human FOP. The phenotype was completely
rescued in double-transgenic mice that also overexpressed the BMP4
inhibitor noggin, confirming the role of BMP4 in the pathogenesis of the
disease.

Liu et al. (2005) demonstrated that mice with conditional inactivation
of the Bmpr1a gene in the facial primordia developed completely
penetrant, bilateral cleft lip/palate (119530) with arrested tooth
formation. The cleft secondary palate of Bmpr1a-mutant embryos was
associated with diminished cell proliferation in maxillary process
mesenchyme and defective anterior posterior patterning. In contrast, the
mutant mice showed elevated apoptosis in the fusing lip region of the
medial nasal process. Conditional inactivation of the Bmp4 gene resulted
in delayed fusion of the medial nasal process to form the lip, resulting
in isolated cleft lip in all mouse embryos at 12 days after conception.
However, cleft lip was only present in 22% of mouse embryos at 14.5 days
after conception, indicating spontaneous repair of cleft lip in utero
(see 600625). The findings implicated a BMP4-BMPR1A genetic pathway that
functions in lip fusion, and revealed that BMP signaling has distinct
roles in lip and palate fusion.

Fuller et al. (2007) found that Bmp4 and Bmp7 (112267) increased rapidly
at the site of chemically-induced demyelinating lesions in adult rat
spinal cord. The Bmp proteins stimulated Smad (see, e.g., SMAD1; 601595)
activation in mature astrocytes, resulting in increased expression of
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and glial scar formation.

Goldman et al. (2009) used Bmp4-hypomorphic mice to investigate the
regulation of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and the maintenance
of steady-state hematopoiesis in adults. Reporter gene analysis showed
that Bmp4 was expressed in osteoblasts, endothelial cells, and
megakaryocytes. Resting hematopoiesis was normal in Bmp4-deficient mice,
but cells expressing Kit (164920) and Sca1 (also known as Ly6a, a
mouse-specific gene) were significantly reduced. Serial transplantation
revealed that Bmp4-deficient recipients had a microenvironmental defect
that reduced the repopulating activity of wildtype HSCs. When wildtype
HSCs did engraft in Bmp4-deficient bone marrow, they showed a marked
decrease in functional stem cell activity. Goldman et al. (2009)
concluded that BMP4 is a critical component of the hematopoietic
microenvironment and is involved in regulating HSC number and function.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 6
BMP4, 2-BP DEL, 226AG

Bakrania et al. (2008) described a kindred in which members of 3
generations had eye, brain, and digit developmental anomalies (MCOPS6;
607932) related to a frameshift mutation in the BMP4 gene (222del2AG,
S76fs104X). The proband had clinical anophthalmia with no light
perception on the right; the left eye showed microcornea, coloboma,
retinal dystrophy, and tilted optic disc. He had mild learning
difficulties and polydactyly. Cranial MRI showed enlarged trigones,
hypoplastic corpus callosum, and sulcal widening. The maternal
grandmother, who carried the same mutation, showed on MRI enlarged
ventricles, hypoplastic corpus callosum, and marked sulcal widening
associated with diffuse brain atrophy; additionally, she had polydactyly
and finger webbing.

In a patient with eye, brain, and digit developmental anomalies (MCOPS6;
607932), Bakrania et al. (2008) identified a 278A-G transition in the
BMP4 gene that resulted in a glu93-to-gly substitution (E93G). The right
eye of the patient showed microphthalmia, sclerocornea, and orbital
cyst; the left eye showed microphthalmia, coloboma, and microcornea.
Cranial MRI showed delayed myelination and mild reduction in white
matter. The proband had developmental delay, seizures, undescended
testes, simple prominent ears, broad hands, low-placed thumbs, and
dysplastic nails.

In a child with a microform cleft lip and cleft palate (OFC11; 600625),
Suzuki et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 1037C-T transition in the
BMP4 gene, resulting in an ala346-to-val (A346V) substitution. His
father, who also carried the mutation, had subtle right microform cleft
lip and a bifid uvula. The microform cleft lip was confirmed by
ultrasound, which detected defects in the orbicularis oris muscle in
both patients.

In a child with a cleft lip and cleft palate (OFC11; 600625), Suzuki et
al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 271A-T transversion in the BMP4
gene, resulting in a ser91-to-cys (S91C) substitution. The child's
parent, who also carried the mutation, had defects of the orbicularis
oris muscle on ultrasonography.

resulting in an arg287-to-his (R287H) substitution. The child's parent,
who also carried the mutation, had defects of the orbicularis oris
muscle on ultrasonography.

MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 6
BMP4, DEL

In a 12-year-old Caucasian girl with bilateral microphthalmia and other
eye anomalies, facial dysmorphism, cognitive impairment, and a history
of hypotonia (MCOPS6; 607932), Reis et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a 158-kb deletion on chromosome 14q22.2, with a
minimum interval chr14:53,361,728-53,520,165 and a maximum interval
chr14:53,352,059-53,520,859 (NCBI36), deleting only the BMP4 gene. In
addition to bilateral microphthalmia, the patient had bilateral
persistence of the pupillary membrane, high myopia, strabismus, and
nystagmus. Her dysmorphic facial features included maxillary hypoplasia
with midface flattening, thin upper lip, broad nasal bridge and tip, and
telecanthus, with a preauricular ear tag on the right. She had normal
growth, head circumference, umbilicus, hands, and feet. The patient was
adopted, and no family members were available for study.

OROFACIAL CLEFT 11
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 6, INCLUDED
BMP4, ARG198TER

In a Mongolian patient with cleft lip and palate (OFC11; 600625), Suzuki
et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a 592C-T transition in exon
4 of the BMP4 gene, resulting in an arg198-to-ter (R198X) substitution.
The parents were unavailable for testing.

In a 19-month-old boy with right clinical anophthalmia and left
microphthalmia, sclerocornea, facial asymmetry, and right-sided
diaphragmatic hernia (MCOPS6; 607932), Reis et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for the R198X mutation in BMP4. The boy also had mild to
moderate laryngomalacia, with indentation from the innominate artery,
and bilateral inguinal hernias. He was macrocephalic with a large
anterior fontanel, and had hydrocephalus that was treated with a large
subdural-peritoneal shunt. Brain MRI at 4 months of age confirmed the
ocular findings and showed macrocrania with very prominent subarachnoid
spaces, superimposed overlying subdural collections, as well as diffuse
cerebral atrophy with ventricular prominence. The mutation was not found
in 179 Caucasian, 89 African American, 91 Asian, and 93 Hispanic
controls.

.0008
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 6
BMP4, 1-BP DUP, 171C

In a 3.5-year-old Caucasian girl with bilateral clinical anophthalmia,
small ears, and small left renal cyst (MCOPS6; 607932), Reis et al.
(2011) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp duplication (171dupC) in
exon 2 of the BMP4 gene, predicted to cause a frameshift and premature
termination. The proband had normal development, without craniofacial
dysmorphism or anomalies of the hands or feet. Head CT in the neonatal
period showed significantly small globes, minimal ocular tissue, and
absent optic nerves, but otherwise normal brain structures. Her affected
9-year-old maternal half sister was found to be compound heterozygous
for 171dupC and a 362A-G transition in exon 2 of BMP4, resulting in a
his121-to-arg (H121R; 112262.0009) substitution at a conserved residue.
The sister had unilateral clinical anophthalmia, blepharophimosis,
telecanthus, and bilateral postaxial polydactyly of the hands. She had
poor growth, with height and weight less than the third centile, and
relative macrocephaly with frontal bossing. Head CT showed atrophic left
globe and small left orbit. Their asymptomatic mother was heterozygous
for the frameshift mutation, with no evidence of mosaicism; the mutation
was apparently de novo, as the maternal grandparents carried wildtype
BMP4 alleles. The mother was unavailable for examination, so mild ocular
anomalies could not be ruled out, and the father was also unavailable
for study. Neither mutation was found in 179 Caucasian, 89 African
American, 91 Asian, and 93 Hispanic controls.

602854	TITLE *602854 PROTEASOME SUBUNIT, ALPHA-TYPE, 1; PSMA1
;;PROTEASOME SUBUNIT NU;;
HC2;;
PROS30
DESCRIPTION DeMartino et al. (1991) cloned the PSMA1 gene, termed 'subunit nu' by
them. The cDNA encoded a 263-amino acid polypeptide. The calculated and
observed molecular masses are 29.5 kD and 35 kD, respectively. Northern
blot analysis revealed an 1.4-kb mRNA in human placenta and HeLa cells.
Coux et al. (1996) noted that 2 proteins, HC2 (29.5 kD) and Pros30 (30.2
kD), are encoded by the PSMA1 gene.

Coux et al. (1996) reviewed the structures and functions of the 20S
proteasome subunits. The alpha subunits comprise the outer rings of the
proteasome. Some alpha subunits contain a functional nuclear
localization signal; proteasomes are found in both the nuclear and
cytoplasmic compartments of the cell. Alpha subunits may constitute a
physical barrier that limits access of cytosolic proteins into the inner
proteolytic chamber.

Bey et al. (1993) mapped the PSMA1 gene to chromosome 11p15.1 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

603444	TITLE *603444 FAR UPSTREAM ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 1; FUBP1
;;FAR UPSTREAM ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN; FUBP;;
FUSE-BINDING PROTEIN; FBP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The far upstream element (FUSE) of the human MYC (190080) protooncogene
stimulates expression in undifferentiated cells. Duncan et al. (1994)
purified a 70-kD FUSE-binding protein, or FBP, that is present in
undifferentiated but not differentiated cells. FBP exhibited DNA binding
specificity for the noncoding strand of the FUSE site in vitro. By PCR
of human cell line cDNA with degenerate primers based on a partial FBP
protein sequence, the authors isolated partial FBP cDNAs. They recovered
additional cDNAs from several libraries and used them to assemble a
full-length FBP cDNA sequence. The central region of the predicted
644-amino acid protein contains 4 copies of a repeat unit. In vitro
binding assays with mutant protein constructs indicated that the third
and fourth copies constituted the minimum single-stranded DNA-binding
domain. Using potassium permanganate to probe DNA conformation in vivo,
Duncan et al. (1994) determined that the pattern of sensitivity of
genomic DNA was consistent with the binding of FBP to the noncoding
strand of FUSE, which displaced the coding strand. Expression of FBP in
human leukemia cells stimulated the activity of a MYC promoter in a
FUSE-dependent manner. Northern blot analysis revealed that expression
of the 2.6-kb FBP mRNA declined upon differentiation, suggesting that
FUSE-binding activity may be regulated transcriptionally. In addition,
by sequence analysis of FBP cDNAs, the authors found evidence that FBP
activity may also be regulated by alternative splicing, translation
efficiency, and posttranslational modification.

GENE FUNCTION

Inherited mutations of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) helicase
subunits XPB (133510) or XPD (278730) yield overlapping DNA repair and
transcription syndromes. The high risk of cancer in these patients is
not fully explained by the repair defect. The transcription defect,
however, is subtle and more difficult to evaluate. Liu et al. (2001)
showed that XPB and XPD mutations block transcription activation by FBP,
a regulator of MYC expression, and block repression by the
FBP-interacting repressor (FIR; 604819). Through TFIIH, FBP facilitates
transcription until promoter escape, whereas after initiation, FIR uses
TFIIH to delay promoter escape. Mutations in TFIIH that impair
regulation by FBP and FIR affect proper regulation of MYC expression and
have implications in the development of malignancy.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bettegowda et al. (2011) performed exonic sequencing of 7
oligodendrogliomas. Among other changes, they found that the CIC gene
(612082) (homolog of the Drosophila gene capicua) on chromosome 19q was
somatically mutated in 6 cases and that the FUBP1 gene on chromosome 1p
was somatically mutated in 2 tumors. Examination of 27 additional
oligodendrogliomas revealed 12 and 3 more tumors with mutations of CIC
and FUBP1, respectively, 58% of which were predicted to result in
truncations of the encoded proteins. Bettegowda et al. (2011) concluded
that their results suggested a critical role for these genes in the
biology and pathology of oligodendrocytes.

608122	TITLE *608122 PARVIN, GAMMA; PARVG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the parvin family, including PARVG, are actin-binding
proteins associated with focal contacts.

CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to mouse Parva
(608120), followed by RT-PCR of a human T-cell line cDNA library, Olski
et al. (2001) cloned human PARVG. Mouse and human PARVG encode a deduced
331-amino acid protein that contains a single actin-binding domain made
up of 2 calponin (600806) homology domains separated by a linker region.
Unlike PARVA and PARVB (608121), the N terminus of PARVG does not
contain nuclear localization signals or SH3-binding domains.

By analyzing PARVG ESTs, Korenbaum et al. (2001) identified
alternatively spliced sequences and a single polyadenylation site.
Northern blot analysis revealed a strong smeared signal in heart, liver,
and several other tissues. Bands of about 1.6 and 4.0 kb were detected
in peripheral blood and spleen. RNA dot blot analysis detected highest
expression in lymphatic organs (spleen, thymus, lymph node, bone marrow,
and peripheral blood leukocytes) and moderate expression in the
digestive tract (stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, ileocecum, and
appendix), lung, and liver. In contrast, mouse Parvg showed highest
expression in testis, where there were at least 6 mRNA species. A 2.8-kb
Parvg transcript was expressed highly in spleen, moderately in lung, and
weakly in brain and heart. Parvg was expressed throughout mouse
embryonic development, with downregulation at embryonic day 11.
Korenbaum et al. (2001) stated that fluorescence-tagged PARVG, like
PARVA, localized at focal contacts.

GENE STRUCTURE

Korenbaum et al. (2001) determined that the PARVG gene contains 15 exons
and spans about 25 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Korenbaum et al. (2001) mapped the PARVG
gene to chromosome 22q13.31, where it lies head to tail about 12 kb
telomeric to the PARVB gene.

610726	TITLE *610726 TRUB PSEUDOURIDINE SYNTHASE, E. COLI, HOMOLOG OF, 1; TRUB1
;;PUS4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pseudouridine is an abundant component of rRNAs and tRNAs and is
enzymatically generated by isomerization of uridine by pseudouridine
synthase (Zucchini et al., 2003).

CLONING

Using database analysis and EST clone assembly, Zucchini et al. (2003)
identified TRUB1. The 349-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular
mass of 37.3 kD and contains 1 TruB domain. Northern blot analysis
showed ubiquitous expression of 5.2-, 3.8-, and 1.75-kb transcripts,
with highest expression seen in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver. TRUB1
shares 30% identity and 45% similarity with TRUB2 (610727). Phylogenetic
analysis showed that TRUB1 and TRUB2 group together with the original
eubacterial tRNA synthases, distinct from DKC1 (300126).

GENE STRUCTURE

Zucchini et al. (2003) determined that the TRUB1 gene consists of 8
exons spanning approximately 40 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zucchini et al. (2003) mapped the TRUB1
gene to chromosome 10.

604146	TITLE *604146 SYNAPTOTAGMIN 7; SYT7
;;PROSTATE CANCER-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 7; PCANAP7;;
IPCA7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Synaptotagmins, such as SYT7, are brain-specific calcium-dependent
phospholipid-binding proteins that play a role in synaptic exocytosis
and neurotransmitter release. See 600782.

CLONING

While constructing a transcript map of the human chromosomal 11q13
interval associated with Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (153700), By
RT-PCR, Li et al. (1995) determined that rat Syt7 is expressed at high
levels in brain and is widely distributed in non-neural tissues,
particularly heart and lung. Cooper et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs
encoding the human homolog of rat synaptotagmin 7. The predicted
403-amino acid human and rat proteins are 98% identical. Northern blot
analysis revealed that synaptotagmin 7 is expressed as 4.4- and 7.5-kb
mRNAs in a variety of human adult and fetal tissues, including those
from different regions of the brain.

Fukuda et al. (2002) identified 1 major and 2 minor isoforms of mouse
Syt7. The 2 minor isoforms contain unique insertions in the spacer
domain between the transmembrane and C2 domains. Similar results were
obtained with respect to human SYT7. Expression of fluorescence-tagged
Syt7 in rat pheochromocytoma cells revealed localization in the
perinuclear region, where it colocalized with a Golgi marker protein,
and localization in the tips of neurites.

By Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy, Caler et al.
(2001) demonstrated expression of a 65-kD SYT7 antigen on membrane
lysosomes, and SYT7 colocalized with LAMP1 (153330) on a number of cell
types.

Using a method called 'Guilt-by-Association' (GBA), which searches for
novel genes whose expression patterns mimic those of known
disease-associated genes, Walker et al. (1999) examined the pairwise
coexpression patterns of 40,000 human genes in 522 cDNA libraries and
identified several novel genes associated with prostate cancer,
including SYT7, which they named IPCA7. IPCA7 expression was
significantly associated with the expressions of the known prostate
cancer-associated genes PSA (KLK3; 176820), PAP (ACPP; 171790), KLK2
(147960), MSMB (157145), and TGM4 (600585).

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro characterization of recombinant rat Syt7, Li et al. (1995)
determined that Syt7 showed Ca(2+)-dependent binding to phospholipids
and Ca(2+)-independent binding to adaptor protein-2 (see 601026). Both
C2 domains also showed Ca(2+)-dependent binding to syntaxins (see
186590).

Sugita et al. (2001) presented evidence that SYT7 functions as a plasma
membrane Ca(2+) sensor in synaptic exocytosis. Alternatively spliced
forms of rodent Syt7 were expressed in a developmentally regulated
pattern in brain and were concentrated in presynaptic active zones of
central synapses. In a rat neuroendocrine cell line, both C2 domains of
Syt7 were potent inhibitors of Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis, but only
when they bound Ca(2+).

Shin et al. (2002) used gain-of-function C2-domain mutants of
synaptotagmin-1 and loss-of-function C2-domain mutants of
synaptotagmin-7 to examine how synaptotagmins function in dense-core
vesicle exocytosis. Their data indicated that phospholipid, but not
SNARE, binding by plasma membrane synaptotagmins is the primary
determinant of calcium-triggered dense-core vesicle exocytosis. Shin et
al. (2002) concluded that their results support a general lipid-based
mechanism of action of synaptotagmins in exocytosis, with the
specificity of various synaptotagmins for different types of fusion
governed by their differential localizations and calcium affinities.

Chronic infection with the intracellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is
prevalent in extensive areas of South and Central America. The parasite
enters cells by a nonphagocytic mechanism. Entry requires mobilization
of host cell lysosomes to the invasion site, as well as the triggering
of a signaling cascade that results in localized elevation of free
calcium. Thus, T. cruzi cell entry has several features resembling
regulated exocytosis. By glass bead loading of cells with antibody to
the C2A calcium-binding and exocytosis-regulating domain of SYT7, Caler
et al. (2001) showed that T. cruzi, but not Toxoplasma gondii or
Salmonella typhimurium, was markedly inhibited from entering the cells.
Likewise, wildtype SYT7 C2A peptides but not those of other SYTs (e.g.,
SYT1; 185605) could block parasite entry. Caler et al. (2001) concluded
that T. cruzi subverts the calcium-regulated lysosomal exocytic
machinery involving the widely expressed SYT7 protein as a strategy for
cell entry.

Roy et al. (2004) found that the lysosomal synaptotagmin SYT7 is
required for a mechanism that promotes phagolysosomal fusion and limits
the intracellular growth of pathogenic bacteria. SYT7 was required for a
form of calcium-dependent phagolysosome fusion that is analogous to
calcium-regulated exocytosis of lysosomes, which can be triggered by
membrane injury. Bacterial type III secretion systems, which
permeabilize membranes and cause calcium influx in mammalian cells,
promote lysosomal exocytosis and inhibit intracellular survival in Syt7
wildtype but not null cells. Thus, the lysosomal repair response can
also protect cells against pathogens that trigger membrane
permeabilization.

Zhao et al. (2008) found that Syt7 was associated with lysosomes in
mouse osteoclasts and with bone matrix protein-containing vesicles in
mouse osteoblasts. Absence of Syt7 inhibited cathepsin K (CTSK; 601105)
secretion and formation of the ruffled border in osteoclasts and bone
matrix protein deposition in osteoblasts. Furthermore, Syt7-deficient
mice were osteopenic due to impaired bone resorption and formation. Zhao
et al. (2008) concluded that SYT7 is involved in bone remodeling and
homeostasis by modulating secretory pathways in osteoclasts and
osteoblasts.

ANIMAL MODEL

Maximov et al. (2008) found that homozygous Syt7-null mice were viable
and fertile. Mutations in Syt7 that inactivated Ca(2+) binding to both
C2 domains destabilized the protein, whereas inactivation of Ca(2+)
binding to only the second C2 domain did not. Inhibitory neurons from
Syt7-null mice were similar to wildtype neurons in synchronous and
asynchronous neurotransmitter release and in presynaptic short-term
plasticity. Maximov et al. (2008) concluded that Ca(2+) binding to SYT7
stabilizes the protein, but it does not regulate synaptic vesicle
exocytosis.

Gustavsson et al. (2008) found that Syt7-null mice had impaired
glucose-induced insulin secretion. Insulin sensitivity and production,
pancreatic islet architecture and ultrastructural organization, and
metabolic and calcium responses were normal in Syt7-null mice.

Loss of Syt1 abolishes fast exocytosis in chromaffin cells, but overall
secretion is reduced by only 20% because slow exocytosis persists. Since
Syt7 has the properties of a slow Ca(2+) sensor, with higher Ca(2+)
affinity and slower binding kinetics than Syt1, Schonn et al. (2008)
examined Ca(2+)-triggered exocytosis in chromaffin cells from
Syt7-knockout mice and from knockin mice containing normal levels of a
mutant Syt7 lacking the second Ca(2+)-binding domain. Both types of
mutant chromaffin cells showed dramatically decreased Ca(2+)-triggered
exocytosis. Moreover, in chromaffin cells lacking both Syt1 and Syt7,
only a very slow release component persisted. Schonn et al. (2008)
concluded that SYT7, together with SYT1, mediates almost all
Ca(2+)-triggered exocytosis in chromaffin cells.

MAPPING

By transcript mapping of the 11q13 gene-rich region, Cooper et al.
(1998) mapped the SYT7 gene to 11q13.

;;GLNRS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GLnRS is a class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (Lamour et al., 1994).
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are enzymes that charge tRNAs with their
cognate amino acids. The specificity of this reaction determines the
fidelity of mRNA translation. At least 1 synthetase exists in the
cytoplasm for each amino acid.

CLONING

Lamour et al. (1994) isolated cDNAs encoding human GlnRS. Northern blot
analysis detected GlnRS expression as an approximately 2.5-kb mRNA in a
variety of tumor cell lines. The predicted 775-amino acid protein
contains the HIGH and KMSKS sequence motifs characteristic of class I
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Human and S. cerevisiae GlnRS are 41%
identical. Both eukaryotic enzymes have a large N-terminal extension
compared to prokaryotic GlnRS.

EVOLUTION

Lamour et al. (1994) noted that GlnRS is present in eukaryotes but is
absent from many prokaryotes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts, in which
Gln-tRNA(Gln) is formed by transamidation of the misacylated
Glu-tRNA(Gln). Sequence comparisons revealed that the eukaryotic
glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS; 612799) has more extensive sequence
similarities with prokaryotic and eukaryotic GlnRS than with the
functionally homologous prokaryotic GluRS. Lamour et al. (1994)
presented evidence that bacterial GlnRS has a eukaryotic origin and was
acquired by a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Lamour et al. (1994) mapped
the GlnRS gene to chromosome 3.

HISTORY

Lamour et al. (1994) noted that a previously cloned gene (EPRS; 138295)
was originally considered to be GlnRS, but was subsequently shown to
encode a multifunctional protein with glutamyl- and prolyl-tRNA
synthetase activities.
