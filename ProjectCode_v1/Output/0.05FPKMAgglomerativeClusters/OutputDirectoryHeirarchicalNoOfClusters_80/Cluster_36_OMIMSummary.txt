C17ORF1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Misalignment of CMT1A-REP elements on chromosome 17p11.2 causes 2
peripheral neuropathies, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1a (118220)
and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (162500).
Using a sequence detected within the proximal CMT1A-REP repeat element,
Kennerson et al. (1997) isolated a fetal brain cDNA for C17ORF1A.
Kennerson et al. (1998) found that C17ORF1A encodes a 252-amino acid
protein with no transmembrane domains and only 1 potential
N-glycosylation site. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a
3.2-kb transcript in skeletal muscle and heart (Kennerson et al., 1997).

GENE STRUCTURE

Kennerson et al. (1998) determined that the C17ORF1A gene contains at
least 6 exons and spans about 17 kb.

MAPPING

Kennerson et al. (1997) mapped the C17ORF1A gene centromeric to and
partially within proximal CMT1A-REP on chromosome 17p11.2. C17ORF1A and
COX10 (602125) are oriented in opposite directions and transcribed from
opposite strands, with exon 6 of C17ORF1A and a duplicated exon 6
('pseudo-exon') of COX10 juxtaposed on the strands. The authors stated
that the presence of these expressed genes may explain the maintenance
of a disease-causing binary repeat within the human genome.

604174	TITLE *604174 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L15; RPL15
DESCRIPTION The mammalian ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species (see 180450) and
approximately 80 different proteins (see 180466).

Adams et al. (1992) isolated an RPL15 cDNA as a human brain EST that
shows sequence similarity to the yeast ribosomal protein YL10 gene.

The complete coding sequence of the human RPL15 gene has been deposited
in GenBank (GENBANK L25899). The deduced RPL15 protein has 205 amino
acids.

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid mapping analyses, Kenmochi
et al. (1998) mapped the human RPL15 gene to 3p.

;;HCMOGT1;;
NSP
HCMOGT1/PDGFRB FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for cDNA clones encoding novel structural proteins,
followed by 3-prime and 5-prime RACE of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Sang
et al. (2004) cloned 4 splice variants of the SPECC1 gene, which they
called NSP. Database analysis showed that the SPECC1 gene is almost
identical to the human sperm antigen, HCMOGT1. There are 2 possible
5-prime ends and 2 possible 3-prime ends. The major coding sequence
shared by all isolated transcripts encodes an ATPase domain similar to
that of SMC family members (see SMC1A; 300040) and a coiled-coil domain
commonly seen in motor or structure proteins. Northern blot analysis
detected strong expression of 4.0- and 2.5-kb transcripts in testis. The
larger transcript was also expressed in spleen, but all other normal
tissues examined showed little or no SPECC1 expression. Variable
expression was detected in some human cancer cell lines, including HeLa
cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of HeLa cells detected SPECC1 in the
nucleus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sang et al. (2004) determined that the SPECC1 gene contains 17 exons and
spans at least 227 kb.

MAPPING

Morerio et al. (2004) identified the HCMOGT1 gene as the fusion partner
on chromosome 17p11.2 of the PDGFRB gene in a t(5;17)(q33;p11.2)
translocation.

By FISH, Sang et al. (2004) mapped the SPECC1 gene to chromosome
17p11.2.

CYTOGENETICS

Morerio et al. (2004) identified the HCMOGT1 gene as a novel fusion
partner to the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, beta gene
(PDGFRB; 173410) by study of the translocation t(5;17)(q33;p11.2) in a
case of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (607785). The HCMOGT1 cDNA
sequence was fused in-frame to PDGFRB at nucleotide 1936 and situated
5-prime to the PDGFRB portion, as in previous studies of PDGFRB fusion
partners. PDGFRB, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, is
constitutively activated by gene fusion with different partners in
myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorders with peculiar clinical
characteristics. The patient studied by Morerio et al. (2004) presented
all the features common to patients with PDGFRB rearrangement: male sex,
splenomegaly, monocytosis, and eosinophilia. Nevertheless, peculiar and
noteworthy were both the age at presentation (18 months) and the
hematologic diagnosis (juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia). Most reported
cases with demonstrated PDGFRB involvement present at a median age of 50
to 60 years; pediatric cases are rare.

614570	TITLE *614570 KINESIN FAMILY MEMBER 18B; KIF18B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KIF18B belongs to the kinesin superfamily of ATPases that move cargo
molecules or organelles along microtubules from the center of the cell
toward the cell periphery. Kinesins contain 4 major domains: a globular
motor domain with binding sites for microtubules and ATP; a short linker
region; a long coiled-coil stalk for dimerization; and a cargo-binding
C-terminal tail domain (summary by Lee et al., 2010).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of HeLa cell mRNA, Lee et al. (2010) cloned KIF18B. The
deduced 842-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 92 kD.
The motor and stalk domains of KIF18B share 60% identity with the
corresponding region of KIF18A (611271). RT-PCR of several human cell
lines revealed a KIF18B splice variant encoding a deduced 873-amino acid
protein, which the authors called isoform-2. Compared with isoform-1,
isoform-2 contains a unique C-terminal end that includes 3 overlapping
PxxP motifs. Northern blot analysis of HeLa cell RNA revealed a 3.0-kb
transcript. RNA dot-blot analysis of several tissues revealed high
KIF18B expression only in amygdala, with weak expression in a limited
number of other adult tissues, fetal tissues, and human cell lines.
RT-PCR analysis revealed variable KIF18B expression in all human cell
lines examined. Western blot analysis of synchronized HeLa cells showed
that KIF18B expression was elevated at late G2 through metaphase and
that KIF18B had an apparent molecular mass of 120 kD.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that KIF18B was present
predominantly in the nucleus and to a lesser extent in the cytoplasm of
interphase cells. During mitosis, most KIF18B was closely associated
with the plus end of astral microtubules emanating from the spindle pole
during prometaphase and metaphase. KIF18B was not detected at anaphase
and telophase. Database analysis revealed orthologs of KIF18B in several
vertebrate species.

Tanenbaum et al. (2011) found that KIF18B localized to microtubule plus
ends during early prometaphase in human U2OS osteosarcoma cells. KIF18B
was not expressed in G1 and was sequestered in the nucleus in G2. KIF18B
was completely degraded at the metaphase-anaphase transition.

GENE FUNCTION

By mutation analysis, Lee et al. (2010) found that only 1 of 3 putative
nuclear localization signals in KIF18B directed nuclear localization.

Using U2OS human osteosarcoma cells, Tanenbaum et al. (2011) identified
KIF18B as an essential component of a microtubule-depolymerizing complex
containing MCAK (KIF2C; 604538) and EB1 (MAPRE1; 603108). KIF18B
interacted independently with MCAK and a subset of EB1 at microtubule
plus ends. All 3 proteins, in addition to KIF18B motor activity, were
required for efficient plus-end microtubule depolymerization. Knockdown
of either KIF18B or MCAK reduced the localization of the other protein
at microtubule plus ends and reduced microtubule depolymerization.
Disruption of the MCAK-KIF18B interaction by mutation of the interacting
domains, or phosphorylation of MCAK by the microtubule-polymerizing
agents Aurora A (AURKA; 603072) or Aurora B (AURKB; 604970), similarly
blocked microtubule depolymerization. Use of a KIF5B (602809)/KIF18B
chimera revealed that the major role of KIF18B motor domain in this
process was to provide plus end-directed movement along microtubules.
Tanenbaum et al. (2011) hypothesized that KIF18B, released into the
cytoplasm upon mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown, is recruited to
microtubule plus ends through interaction with EB1 and MCAK. The motor
activity of KIF18B directs the complex to the tip of microtubules, and
the depolymerizing activity of the complex is modulated by Aurora A and
Aurora B.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lee et al. (2010) determined that the KIF18B gene contains 15 exons, the
last of which is alternatively spliced.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the KIF18B gene to chromosome 17q21.31 based on an
alignment of the KIF18B sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC044933) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;VIRUS-INDUCED SIGNALING ADAPTOR; VISA;;
IFNB PROMOTER STIMULATOR 1; IPS1;;
CARD ADAPTOR INDUCING IFNB; CARDIF;;
KIAA1271
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Double-stranded RNA viruses are recognized in a cell type-dependent
manner by the transmembrane receptor TLR3 (603029) or by the cytoplasmic
RNA helicases MDA5 (606951) and RIGI (DDX58; 609631). These interactions
initiate signaling pathways that differ in their initial steps but
converge in the activation of the protein kinases IKKA (CHUK; 600664)
and IKKB (IKBKB; 603258), which activate NFKB (see 164011), or TBK1
(604834) and IKKE (IKBKE; 605048), which activate IRF3 (603734).
Activated IRF3 and NFKB induce transcription of IFNB (IFNB1; 147640).
For the TLR3 pathway, the intermediary molecule before the pathways
converge is the cytoplasmic protein TRIF (TICAM1; 607601). For RIGI, the
intermediary protein is mitochondria-bound IPS1 (Sen and Sarkar, 2005).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned KIAA1271. The transcript contains
several repetitive elements in its 3-prime UTR, and the deduced protein
contains 542 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected intermediate expression
in all tissues and specific brain regions examined except testis and
fetal brain, in which expression was low.

By screening for proteins that activated the NFKB and MAPK (see MAPK1;
176948) signaling pathways, followed by database analysis, Xu et al.
(2005) identified 2 VISA splice variants. Both transcripts encode a
deduced 540-amino acid protein with an N-terminal CARD module followed
by a TRAF2 (601895)-binding motif and 2 TRAF6 (602355)-binding motifs.
Northern blot analysis detected 9.5- and 3.4-kb VISA transcripts in all
tissues examined. Western blot analysis detected endogenous VISA at
about 62 kD in human cell lines.

Independently, Seth et al. (2005), Kawai et al. (2005), and Meylan et
al. (2005) also cloned and characterized VISA, which they called MAVS,
IPS1, and CARDIF, respectively. Seth et al. (2005) identified a
C-terminal transmembrane domain in MAVS that targets the protein to
mitochondria.

GENE FUNCTION

Xu et al. (2005) demonstrated that VISA is critical in the IFNB (147640)
signaling pathway and is required for both Sendai virus-triggered
TLR3-mediated and TLR3-independent signaling. In the TLR3-mediated
signaling pathway, VISA interacted with TRIF and TRAF6 and mediated
bifurcation of the NFKB and IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE)
activation pathways. In the TLR3-independent signaling pathway, VISA and
RIGI interacted via their respective CARD modules, and VISA functioned
as an adaptor to recruit downstream components, such as IRF3, to the
RIGI complex. Xu et al. (2005) concluded that VISA plays essential roles
in antiviral responses by participating in 2 virus-triggered IFN
signaling pathways.

Seth et al. (2005) showed that silencing of MAVS through RNA
interference abolished NFKB and IRF3 activation by viruses, leading to
increased viral replication. In contrast, MAVS overexpression induced
IFNB expression following NFKB and IRF3 activation. Additional
interference, knockdown, and mutation analyses indicated that MAVS
functions downstream of RIGI and that its CARD is essential for MAVS
signaling. Seth et al. (2005) confirmed by mutation analysis, confocal
microscopy, and subcellular fractionation that the C-terminal
transmembrane domain of MAVS is required for IFNB activation and for
localization to the outer mitochondrial membrane. When targeted to other
membrane locations, MAVS failed to activate IFNB. Seth et al. (2005)
concluded that MAVS function leads to stronger antiviral immunity and
proposed that mitochondria may have a role in innate immunity.

Kawai et al. (2005) also characterized IPS1 function and found that the
CARD of IPS1 interacted with the CARDs of RIGI and MDA5. Overexpression
of IPS1 resulted in activation of IFNB, IP10 (CXCL10; 147310), and
RANTES (CCL5; 187011). IPS1 overexpression also enhanced IFNA4 (147564)
and IFNA6 (147566) expression when coexpressed with IRF7 (605047).

In addition to the interactions documented by Seth et al. (2005) and
Kawai et al. (2005), Meylan et al. (2005) found that the NS3-4A serine
protease from hepatitis C virus (HCV; see 609532) targets and
inactivates CARDIF. They determined that NS3-4A cleaves CARDIF after
cys508, thereby blocking IRF3 activation and IFNB production.

Independently, Li et al. (2005) demonstrated that HCV NS3-4A cleaves
MAVS at cys508. Immunoprecipitation analysis and confocal microscopy
showed that NS3-4A bound to and colocalized with MAVS in mitochondria.
Li et al. (2005) proposed that sequence variation in MAVS might account
for the exposed individuals who mount a successful immune response
against HCV and other viruses that inhibit IFN production by attacking
MAVS or other mitochondrial proteins.

Moore et al. (2008) showed that NLRX1 (611947), a highly conserved
nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing
(NLR) family member, localizes to the mitochondrial outer membrane and
interacts with MAVS. Expression of NLRX1 resulted in the potent
inhibition of RIG (609631)-like helicase (RLH) family and MAVS-mediated
IFNB promoter activity and in the disruption of virus-induced RLH-MAVS
interactions. Depletion of NLRX1 with small interference RNA promoted
virus-induced type I interferon (see 147570) production and decreased
viral replication. Moore et al. (2008) concluded that their work
identified NLRX1 as a check against mitochondrial antiviral responses
and represented an intersection of 3 ancient cellular processes: NLR
signaling, intracellular virus detection, and the use of mitochondria as
a platform for antipathogen signaling. They also concluded that their
work represented a conceptual advance, in that NLRX1 is a modulator of
pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptors rather than a receptor,
and identified a key therapeutic target for enhancing antiviral
responses.

Using a cell-free system, Hou et al. (2011) showed that after viral
infection MAVS formed large aggregates that potently activated IRF3. The
aggregates formed self-perpetuating, fiber-like polymers that
efficiently converted endogenous MAVS into functional aggregates. These
properties closely resembled those of prions (see 176640), including
fibrous aggregates, detergent and protease resistance, and the ability
to 'infect' endogenous protein and convert the native conformation into
fibrous aggregates. The formation of MAVS aggregates resulted in a gain
of function, and the conformational change was tightly regulated by
viral infection. Incubation of endogenous MAVS with RIGI, mitochondria,
and lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains also converted MAVS into
functional aggregates. Hou et al. (2011) proposed that a prion-like
conformational switch of MAVS activates and propagates the antiviral
signaling cascade.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the KIAA1271
gene to chromosome 20.

ANIMAL MODEL

Sun et al. (2006) found that deletion of Mavs in mice abolished viral
induction of interferon and prevented activation of Nfkb and Irf3 in
multiple cell types, but not plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Interferon
expression in response to cytosolic DNA or Listeria monocytogenes was
not affected by Mavs deficiency, and viability and fertility were not
compromised. Mavs -/- mice challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus
had significantly higher viral titers than Mavs +/- or wildtype mice 12
to 48 hours after infection, but not 72 hours after infection. Mavs -/-
and Mavs +/- mice, but not most wildtype mice, succumbed to infection in
a dose- and Mavs-dependent manner. Sun et al. (2006) concluded that
cytosolic viral signaling through MAVS is required for innate immune
responses against viral infection.

Kumar et al. (2006) found that Ips1-deficient mice had defective
induction of type I Ifn and inflammatory cytokines after infection with
various RNA viruses and were susceptible to the RNA virus infection.
However, Ips1 was not essential for responses to DNA viruses. Kumar et
al. (2006) concluded that IPS1 is an essential component in RIGI- and
MDA5-dependent signaling that triggers the host response to infection
with various RNA viruses.

610464	TITLE *610464 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 156; GPR156
;;GABABL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a large superfamily of
proteins that transmit signals from extracellular messenger molecules
and sensory stimuli to intracellular signaling pathways. GPR156 belongs
to the glutamate receptor subfamily of GPCRs (Bjarnadottir et al.,
2005).

CLONING

By database searching for sequences homologous to those of the GABA-B
receptor subunits GABBR1 (603540) and GABBR2 (607340), Calver et al.
(2003) identified GPR156, which they called GABABL, and subsequently
cloned a full-length GPR156 cDNA from a fetal brain cDNA library. The
deduced 814-amino acid protein contains a putative coiled-coil domain
and dileucine and several RXR(R) endoplasmic reticulum retention motifs
in the C terminus. Semiquantitative RT-PCR showed expression of GPR156
at high levels in human testis, moderate levels in fetal brain, and low
levels in all other tissues and brain regions tested. Within neural
tissues, expression was highest in the pituitary gland. Northern blot
analysis detected transcripts of 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0 kb in testis,
suggesting alternative splicing. Antibodies developed against
GPR156-specific peptides detected a protein of 87 kD in rat brain and in
membranes from HEK293 cells. Studies of rat brain showed abundant
expression in the olfactory tubercles, islands of Calleja, nucleus
accumbens, piriform cortex, and all fields of the hippocampus.

By database analysis, Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) identified GABABL
orthologs in mouse and fish. The deduced mouse protein contains 798
amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) determined that the GPR156 gene contains 9
exons.

GENE FUNCTION

By cotransfection of HEK293 cells with GPR156 and either GABBR1 or
GABBR2, Calver et al. (2003) demonstrated that GPR156 could not
substitute for either GABA-B subunit in a functional GABA-B receptor.
Human GPR156 protein expression could only be detected with the addition
of an exogenous signal sequence.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Calver et al. (2003) mapped the GPR156
gene to chromosome 3q13-q22.

By genomic sequence analysis, Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) mapped the
GPR156 gene to chromosome 3q13.33. They mapped the mouse Gpr156 gene to
chromosome 16.

607023	TITLE *607023 POLO-LIKE KINASE 2; PLK2
;;SERUM-INDUCIBLE KINASE; SNK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Serum-inducible kinase is a member of the 'polo' family of
serine/threonine protein kinases that have a role in normal cell
division.

CLONING

Liby et al. (2001) identified SNK in a database search of sequences with
significant homology to the polo kinases PRK (CNK; 602913) and PLK
(602098). The deduced 685-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 78 kD and contains an ATP-binding motif within the kinase
domain and a conserved polo box. SNK shares about 97% sequence identity
with the mouse and rat proteins. Dot blot analysis indicated a
ubiquitous low level of SNK expression. Highest expression was found in
adult testis, spleen, putamen, and occipital lobe, and in fetal lung,
spleen, kidney, and heart.

GENE FUNCTION

By Northern blot analysis, Liby et al. (2001) found rapid induction of
SNK mRNA in human lung fibroblasts upon reintroduction of serum
following 36 hours of serum deprivation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SNK
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP WI-13092).

604037	TITLE *604037 RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB5C; RAB5C
;;RAB-LIKE, FORMERLY; RABL, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the Rab protein family are small GTPases of the Ras
superfamily that are thought to ensure fidelity in the process of
docking and/or fusion of vesicles with their correct acceptor
compartment (Han et al., 1996).

CLONING

Han et al. (1996) isolated fetal lung cDNAs encoding a RAB protein that
they designated RABL (RAB5-like). The predicted 216-amino acid RABL
protein shares 86% identity with RAB5A (179512) and RAB5B (179514) and
contains the conserved GTP-binding site characteristic of RAS proteins.
RT-PCR analysis revealed that RABL is expressed ubiquitously.

MAPPING

By analysis of cloned segments, Albertsen et al. (1994) determined that
the RAB5C gene, which they called BC1-16, is located in the BRCA1
(113705) gene region on chromosome 17q12-q21. Han et al. (1996) refined
the map position to 17q21.2 using FISH.

;;KALLIKREIN 7;;
PROTEASE, SERINE, 6; PRSS6;;
STRATUM CORNEUM CHYMOTRYPTIC ENZYME; SCCE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KLK7 belongs to the kallikrein subfamily of serine proteases, which are
involved in a variety of enzymatic processes (Gan et al., 2000).

CLONING

The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis, i.e., the
stratified squamous epithelium lining the body surface. The cells of the
stratum corneum, the corneocytes, represent the end stage of the
epidermal differentiation process. Corneocytes are highly resistant
anucleated cells mainly consisting of keratin filaments surrounded by a
crosslinked protein envelope. The mechanical resistance of the stratum
corneum is dependent on the cohesion between individual corneocytes,
which is mediated to a major extent by modified desmosomes. Since a
fraction of epidermal cells continuously leaves the proliferating basal
layer and goes through differentiation, there is a continuous de novo
production of corneocytes. This is balanced to give a constant and
well-regulated stratum corneum thickness by cell shedding at the skin
surface in a process called desquamation. Desquamation means elimination
of stratum corneum cell cohesion in superficial cell layers. It has been
established that proteolysis of intercellular cohesive structures is of
major importance in the series of events preceding desquamation. Stratum
corneum chymotryptic enzyme (SCCE), or kallikrein-7 (KLK7), is a serine
proteinase with an inhibitor profile, pH dependence, and tissue
localization compatible with a role in desquamation. Egelrud (1993)
purified SCCE from human plantar corneocytes. SDS-PAGE indicated that
the purified preparation contained 1 major component with an apparent
molecular mass of 25 kD and 1 minor component with a slightly higher
apparent molecular mass. Both of these components were associated with
chymotrypsin-like activity, although SCCE differed significantly from
bovine chymotrypsin, human cathepsin G (116830), and human mast cell
chymases (see 118938) in its relative activity toward various substrates
and in its inhibitor profile. Hansson et al. (1994) sequenced the
N-terminal region of the native SCCE enzyme. By screening a human
keratinocyte cDNA library with a degenerate oligonucleotide based on the
amino acid sequence of SCCE, they isolated 2 forms of SCCE cDNA that
differed only in the 3-prime untranslated region. The predicted
253-amino acid protein consists of a 22-amino acid signal peptide and a
7-amino acid propeptide followed by the active enzyme. SCCE contains the
conserved active site regions of serine proteinases and a potential
N-glycosylation site. The amino acid sequence homology between SCCE and
human chymotrypsin, cathepsin G, and mast cell chymase, all of which
have chymotryptic activity, did not exceed 40%. Hansson et al. (1994)
demonstrated that SCCE is heterogenously glycosylated. Northern blot
analysis detected 1.2- and 2.0-kb SCCE transcripts in human skin.
Abundant SCCE mRNA expression was restricted to skin, with very low
levels of expression found in brain and kidney. Immunohistochemical
analyses had shown that the SCCE protein is present in high suprabasal
keratinocytes in the epidermis and in the keratinizing inner root sheet
of the hair follicle (Sondell et al., 1994). In the human oral cavity,
only suprabasal keratinocytes at sites where a stratum corneum is formed
contained SCCE.

Yousef et al. (2000) noted the presence of 12 cysteine residues in KLK7,
10 of which are conserved in all serine proteases, and 2 of which are
also found in other KLK proteins. RT-PCR analysis revealed expression
primarily in brain, mammary gland, cerebellum, spinal cord, kidney, and
skin, with lower levels or none detected in other tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Yousef et al. (2000) observed the upregulation of KLK7 expression in a
breast cancer cell in response to estrogens and glucocorticoids.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Yousef et al. (2000) determined that the
KLK7 gene contains 6 exons, 5 of which are coding. The gene spans 6 kb.

MAPPING

By computational analysis, Yousef et al. (2000) mapped the KLK7 gene to
chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4 between KLK6 (602652) and KLK8 (605644).

111730	TITLE *111730 BETA-1,4-N-ACETYL-GALACTOSAMINYLTRANSFERASE 2; B4GALNT2
;;GALGT2;;
CT-GalNAc TRANSFERASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

B4GALNT2 catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of the human Sd(a)
antigen, which is found on more than 90% of Caucasian red blood cells,
through the addition of an N-acetylgalactosamine residue via a beta-1,4
linkage to a subterminal galactose residue substituted with an
alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid. B4GALNT2 also catalyzes the last step in
the biosynthesis of the Cad antigen, which is related both serologically
and biochemically to the Sd(a) antigen (summary by Montiel et al.,
2003).

CLONING

CT1 and CT2 are monoclonal antibodies that recognize an oligosaccharide
structure that is identical, at least in part, to Sd(a). Using
expression cloning to identify a mouse cDNA that synthesized an epitope
recognized by CT2, Smith and Lowe (1994) cloned B4galnt2, which they
designated CT-GalNAc transferase. The deduced 510-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 58.3 kD. It has characteristics of a type
II transmembrane glycosyltransferase, with a short N-terminal tail,
followed by a transmembrane domain and a 478-amino acid C-terminal
catalytic domain predicted to face the Golgi lumen. The mouse CT-GalNAc
transferase cDNA shares 51% nucleotide identity with the human cDNA
encoding GM2/GD2 synthase (B4GALNT1; 601873), with highest identity in
the region encoding the catalytic domain.

Dohi et al. (1996) obtained a partial human B4GALNT2 sequence by RT-PCR
of gastric mucosa RNA using primers based on mouse CT-GalNAcT. The human
cDNA fragment shared 86% nucleotide identity with mouse CT-GalNAc
transferase and 63% identity with human GM2/GD2 GalNAc transferase.
Northern blot analysis detected a 2-kb B4GALNT2 transcript in normal
gastric mucosa. RT-PCR detected expression in normal human stomach,
jejunum, and ileum, with a proximal-to-distal gradient of expression in
colon.

By searching databases for sequence similar to mouse B4galnt2, followed
by RT-PCR and 5-prime RACE of a human colon carcinoma cell line, Montiel
et al. (2003) cloned 2 variants of B4GALNT2. The longer transcript
encodes a deduced 566-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular
mass of 63.3 kD. It contains an N-terminal cytosolic domain, followed by
a transmembrane domain and a long catalytic domain. The shorter
transcript encodes a deduced 506-amino acid protein with calculated
molecular mass of 57.0 kD. It has a different N-terminal cytosolic
domain than the full-length form. Northern blot analysis detected
B4GALNT2 transcripts of 8.8, 6.1, 4.7, 3.8, and 1.65 kb. Highest
expression was in colon, with lower expression in kidney, stomach,
ileum, and rectum. RNA dot blot analysis showed basal and low expression
of B4GALNT2 in all normal tissues examined, and RT-PCR detected
expression in several cancer cell lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Montiel et al. (2003) determined that the B4GALNT2 gene contains at
least 12 exons, including 2 alternatively spliced first exons, and spans
more than 36 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Montiel et al. (2003) mapped the B4GALNT2
gene to chromosome 17q23.1. The mouse gene maps to chromosome 11 in a
region that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 17 (Mohlke et
al., 1999).

GENE FUNCTION

By biochemical analysis, Smith and Lowe (1994) confirmed that mouse
CT-GalNAc transferase synthesized the epitope recognized by human
anti-Sd(a) serum.

Using RT-PCR, Dohi et al. (1996) found that 6 of 9 cases of gastric
cancer and 9 of 13 cases of colonic cancer lacked B4GALNT2 transcript.
These results correlated with a lack of B4GALNT2 activity measured in
the same samples. Dohi et al. (1996) concluded that reduced B4GALNT2
transcription results in disappearance of the Sd(a) epitope in
gastrointestinal cancer.

Montiel et al. (2003) found that a soluble B4GALNT2 protein N-terminally
truncated at gly89 could transfer N-acetylgalactosamine to several
natural and synthetic acceptor substrates, but it required a galactose
residue to be beta-1,3-linked to an N-acetylglucosamine or
N-acetylgalactosamine residue or beta-1,4-linked to glucose or an
N-acetylglucosamine residue.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

ANIMAL MODEL

Type I von Willebrand disease (VWD1; 193400), characterized by reduced
levels of plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF; 613160), is the most common
inherited bleeding disorder in humans. Mohlke et al. (1996) noted that
penetrance of VWD is incomplete, and expression of the bleeding
phenotype is highly variable. In addition, plasma VWF levels vary widely
among normal individuals. It is likely that the wide range of severity,
variable expressivity, and incomplete penetrance of von Willebrand
disease eventually may be explained through a complex series of
interactions between the VWF gene and a variety of modifier genes,
including proteins involved in posttranslational processing and other
aspects of VWF biosynthesis and clearance. To identify genes that
influence VWF level, Mohlke et al. (1996) analyzed a genetic cross
between 2 strains of mice that exhibit a 20-fold difference in plasma
Vwf levels (Sweeney et al., 1990). DNA samples from F2 progeny
demonstrating either extremely high or extremely low plasma Vwf levels
were pooled and phenotyped for 41 markers spanning the autosomal genome.
A novel locus accounting for 63% of the total variance in Vwf levels was
mapped to distal mouse chromosome 11, a site distinct from the murine
Vwf locus on chromosome 6. Mohlke et al. (1996) designated the locus
Mvwf for 'modifier of Vwf.' Additional genotyping of as many as 2,407
meioses established a high resolution genetic map placing the gene
between Ngfr (162010) and Hoxb9 (142964), and it was closely linked to
Gip (137240). The Mvwf candidate interval between Ngfr and Hoxb9 was
approximately 0.5 cM. The results of Mohlke et al. (1996) demonstrated
that a single dominant gene accounted for the low Vwf phenotype of 1
strain of mice and crosses with several other strains. The pattern of
inheritance suggested a gain-of-function mutation in a unique component
of Vwf biosynthesis or processing. They commented that characterization
of the human homolog for Mvwf may have relevance for a subset of type 1
VWD cases and may define an important genetic factor modifying
penetrance and expression of mutations at the VWF locus.

GALGT2 is expressed primarily in the gut epithelium in both mice and
humans. Mohlke et al. (1999) found that Mvwf, the gene responsible for
modifying plasma levels of Vwf in a strain of mice, was Galgt2. They
showed that the mutation causing deficiency of Vwf changed expression of
the gene from gut specific to the vascular endothelium. Ginsburg (1999)
expressed the opinion that the same alteration is highly unlikely in
humans. However, the Mvwf modifier gene effect may be a useful paradigm
for understanding genetic modification of plasma VWF levels.

126255	TITLE *126255 DISTAL-LESS HOMEOBOX 2; DLX2
;;TES1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To isolate genes involved in forebrain development, Porteus et al.
(1992) used subtractive hybridization of cDNA libraries to enrich for
cDNAs that are encoded by genes preferentially expressed in mouse
gestational day-15 telencephalon. In an attempt to find genes that are
candidates for the regulation of forebrain development, the subtracted
cDNA library was screened with probes homologous to the homeobox, a
conserved motif found in transcriptional regulators that often control
development. A novel cDNA, named Tes1, that encodes a homeodomain was
identified. Its sequence showed that Tes1 was a member of the
'Distal-less' family of homeodomain-encoding genes. Related by amino
acid homology within their homeodomains, the known members of the family
are Tes1, Dlx1 (600029), and Dll (a Drosophila melanogaster gene).

McGuinness et al. (1996) reported the DNA sequence of the human DLX2
gene and compared it to the murine gene. The deduced sequence of the
human DLX2 protein shows that the human and mouse DLX2 proteins are 92%
identical. The human DLX2 protein is 330 amino acids in length, while
the mouse DLX2 protein contains 332 amino acids. The introns have 63 to
71% identity. Domains identified in the human and mouse DLX2 protein
include a homeodomain and short stretches of homology to several
transcription factors.

GENE STRUCTURE

McGuinness et al. (1996) determined that the human DLX2 gene has 3
exons.

MAPPING

Ozcelik et al. (1992) determined the chromosomal location of the DLX2
gene in mouse and human. By Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrid
lines, they assigned the human locus to chromosome 2cen-q33 and the
mouse locus to chromosome 2. An EcoRI dimorphism was used for
recombinant inbred strain mapping in the mouse. The results placed the
Dlx2 gene near the Hox4 cluster on mouse chromosome 2.

Simeone et al. (1994) found that the DLX1 and DLX2 genes are localized
to chromosome 2q32 near the HOXD (formerly HOX4; 142980-142989) cluster
at 2q31, as had previously been suggested for the mouse. The mapping was
done by study of rodent/human hybrid cells and by fluorescence in situ
hybridization. The genes were found to be closely linked, i.e., about 8
kb apart, in an inverted convergent (i.e., tail-to-tail) configuration.

Zerucha et al. (2000) reported that the vertebrate Dlx1 and Dlx2 genes
are organized in a conserved tail-to-tail arrangement.

GENE FUNCTION

Using retroviral labeling in organotypic slice cultures of the embryonic
human forebrain, Letinic et al. (2002) demonstrated the existence of 2
distinct lineages of neocortical GABAergic neurons. One lineage
expresses DLX1 and DLX2 and MASH1 (100790) transcription factors,
represents 65% of neocortical GABAergic neurons in humans, and
originates from MASH1-expressing progenitors of the neocortical
ventricular and subventricular zone of the dorsal forebrain. The second
lineage, characterized by the expression of DLX1 and DLX2 but not MASH1,
forms around 35% of the GABAergic neurons and originates from the
ganglionic eminence of the ventral forebrain. Letinic et al. (2002)
suggested that modifications in the expression pattern of transcription
factors in the forebrain may underlie species-specific programs for the
generation of neocortical local circuit neurons and that distinct
lineages of cortical interneurons may be differentially affected in
genetic and acquired diseases of the human brain.

PITX2 (601542) and DLX2 are transcription markers observed during early
tooth development. Espinoza et al. (2002) demonstrated that PITX2 binds
to bicoid and bicoid-like elements in the DLX2 promoter and activates
this promoter 30-fold in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Mutations in PITX2
associated with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (see 180500) provided the first
link of this homeodomain transcription factor to tooth development. One
mutation produces Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome with iris hypoplasia but
without tooth anomalies; this allele has a similar DNA binding
specificity compared to wildtype PITX2 and transactivates the DLX2
promoter. In contrast, a different PITX2 mutation produces Rieger
syndrome with the full spectrum of developmental anomalies, including
tooth anomalies; this allele is unable to transactivate the DLX2
promoter. Since DLX2 expression is required for tooth and craniofacial
development, the lack of tooth anomalies in the patient with iris
hypoplasia may be due to the residual activity of this mutant in
activating the DLX2 promoter. The authors proposed a molecular mechanism
for tooth development involving DLX2 gene expression in Axenfeld-Rieger
patients.

Thomas et al. (2000) identified regulatory regions of the mouse Dlx2
upstream sequence that drove epithelial but not mesenchymal expression
of Dlx2 in the first branchial arch. Epithelial expression of Dlx2 was
regulated by planar signaling by Bmp4 (112262), which was coexpressed in
distal oral epithelium. Mesenchymal expression was regulated by a
different mechanism involving Fgf8 (600483), which was expressed in the
overlying epithelium. Fgf8 also inhibited expression of Dlx2 in the
epithelium by a signaling pathway that required the mesenchyme. Thomas
et al. (2000) concluded that Bmp4 and Fgf8 maintain the strict
epithelial and mesenchymal expression of Dlx2 in the first branchial
arch of developing mice.

Zerucha et al. (2000) found that, like DLX1 and DLX2, the mouse and
human DLX5 (600028) and DLX6 (600030) genes, as well as their zebrafish
orthologs, Dlx4 and Dlx6, respectively, are arranged in a tail-to-tail
orientation. The intergenic region between zebrafish, mouse, and human
DLX5 and DLX6 is highly conserved, with 2 nucleotide stretches reaching
about 85% nucleotide identity among these species. Using knockdown and
reporter gene assays, Zerucha et al. (2000) showed that the zebrafish
Dlx4/Dlx6 intergenic region drove expression of mouse Dlx5 and Dlx6
reporter genes in the ventral thalamus/hypothalamus and in basal
telencephalon in transgenic mouse forebrain. Although their expression
patterns overlapped, the Dlx5 reporter was more highly expressed in the
subventricular zone, whereas the Dlx6 reporter was more highly expressed
in the mantle zone, similar to endogenous mouse Dlx5 and Dlx6. Activity
of the zebrafish intergenic enhancer was reduced in the subventricular
zone, but not in the mantle zone, in mice lacking Dlx1 and Dlx2,
consistent with decreased endogenous Dlx5 and Dlx6 expression. In
zebrafish forebrain, Dlx1 and Dlx2 were expressed in more immature cells
than Dlx4 and Dlx6. Cotransfection and DNA-protein binding experiments
with mouse and zebrafish proteins suggested that Dlx1 and/or Dlx2 are
required for Dlx5 and Dlx6 expression in forebrain and that this
regulation is mediated by the intergenic enhancer sequence.

Glutamic acid decarboxylases (see GAD1; 605363) are required for
synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in GABAergic neurons. Using
electroporation to introduce Dlx1, Dlx2, and Dlx5 plasmids in embryonic
mouse cerebral cortex, Stuhmer et al. (2002) found that Dlx2 and Dlx5,
but not Dlx1, induced expression of the glutamic acid decarboxylases
Gad65 (GAD2; 138275) and Gad67 (GAD1) to variable degrees. Dlx2 induced
expression of endogenous Dlx5, but not Dlx6. Dlx2 and Dlx5 induced
expression of a mouse Dlx5/Dlx6 intergenic region reporter in all brain
regions examined, whereas Dlx1 induced expression of the reporter in a
more restricted pattern.

ANIMAL MODEL

Qiu et al. (1995) utilized information about the genomic structure of
the murine Dlx2 gene to carry out gene targeting experiments and made
deletions in the Dlx2 gene in mouse embryonic stem cells for use in
transgenic mice. They reported that heterozygous mice appeared normal
and homozygous mice died on the day of birth. The mutant mice had
altered differentiation of interneurons in the olfactory bulb and
abnormal morphogenesis of the cranial neural crest-derived skeletal
structures formed from the proximal first and second branchial arches,
causing cleft palate.

Kraus and Lufkin (2006) reviewed mouse studies of Dlx gene family loss-
and gain-of-function mutations and the role of Dlx homeobox genes in
craniofacial, limb, and bone development.

610284	TITLE *610284 LIPOYLTRANSFERASE 1; LIPT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In mammals, lipoyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.181) catalyzes the second of 2
steps in the covalent attachment of lipoic acid to lipoate-dependent
proteins, including the glycine cleavage system H protein (GCSH; 238330)
and the dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2) subunits of the pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex (DLAT; 608770), the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
complex (DLST; 126063), and the branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase
complex (DBT; 248610) (Fujiwara et al., 1999).

CLONING

Using a bovine lipoyltransferase cDNA fragment as probe, Fujiwara et al.
(1999) cloned human LIPT1 from a liver cDNA library. The deduced
373-amino acid precursor protein shares 88% and 31% sequence identity
with bovine lipoyltransferase II and E. coli lipoate-protein ligase A,
respectively. By alignment of LIPT1 with the bovine lipoyltransferase
amino acid sequence, Fujiwara et al. (1999) predicted that the
N-terminal 26 amino acids comprise a mitochondrial targeting sequence,
with the threonine-27 corresponding to the first residue of the mature
enzyme. Thus, the deduced mature LIPT1 enzyme contains 347 amino acids
with a calculated molecular mass of 39.539 kD. Northern blot analysis
detected a major 1.5-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in skeletal muscle and heart, followed by liver, brain,
placenta, and lung.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fujiwara et al. (1999) determined that the LIPT1 gene contains 4 exons
and spans 8 kb of genomic DNA. They found evidence of several LIPT1
transcripts resulting from alternative splicing in the 5-prime
untranslated region.

MAPPING

By FISH, Fujiwara et al. (1999) mapped the LIPT1 gene to chromosome
2q11.2.
