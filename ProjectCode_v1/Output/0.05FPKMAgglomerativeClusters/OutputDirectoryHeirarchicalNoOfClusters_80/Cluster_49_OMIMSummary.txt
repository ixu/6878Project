;;MEMBRANE-TYPE MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 5; MT5-MMP
DESCRIPTION The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent
endopeptidases that degrade the different protein components of the
extracellular matrix and basement membranes. Based on their primary
structures, substrate specificity, and cellular localization, the human
MMPs can be classified into at least 4 main subfamilies: the
collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, and membrane-type MMPs
(MT-MMPs). By searching an EST database for sequences similar to
previously described MMPs, Llano et al. (1999) identified MMP24, which
they called MT5-MMP. They isolated a complete MMP24 coding sequence. The
predicted 645-amino acid MMP24 protein displays a number of features
characteristic of MMPs, including a signal sequence, a prodomain with a
cysteine residue essential for maintaining latency, a catalytic domain
of approximately 170 residues that contains a consensus sequence
involved in zinc binding, and an approximately 200-amino acid segment
with sequence similarity to hemopexin (142290). In addition, MMP24
contains 3 insertions characteristic of the MT subclass of MMPs,
including a C-terminal extension consisting of putative transmembrane
and cytoplasmic domains. The authors demonstrated that recombinant MMP24
protein expressed in mammalian cells localizes to the plasma membrane.
They showed that the catalytic domain of MMP24 exhibits potent
proteolytic activity against progelatinase A (MMP2; 120360). Northern
blot analysis of normal human tissues detected an approximately 4.5-kb
MMP24 transcript predominantly in brain and slightly smaller MMP24
transcripts in kidney, pancreas, and lung. Analysis of MMP24 expression
in a variety of brain tumors, including astrocytomas, anaplastic
astrocytomas, glioblastomas, mixed gliomas, oligodendrogliomas,
ependymomas, neurocytomas, and meningiomas, indicated that MMP24 was
significantly overexpressed in several astrocytomas, anaplastic
astrocytomas, and glioblastomas, as compared to normal brain tissue. In
contrast, MMP24 was expressed at very low or undetectable levels in all
meningiomas tested.

By FISH, Llano et al. (1999) mapped the MMP24 gene to 20q11.2. By
radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Kinoh et al. (1999) mapped the human
MMP24 gene to 20q11.2-q12 and the mouse homolog to chromosome 2.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The SLC20A2 gene encodes an inorganic phosphate transporter that belongs
to the type III sodium-dependent phosphate transporter family (see
SLC20A1, 137570). These genes show broad expression in a variety of
tissues and likely play a housekeeping role in cellular phosphate uptake
(summary by Wang et al., 2012).

CLONING

The host range of retroviruses is determined primarily by the presence
of specific receptors on target cells which are recognized by the
retroviral envelope glycoprotein. Kaelbling et al. (1991) described a
receptor for the gibbon ape leukemia retrovirus. In an effort to isolate
related human genes to determine if these function as receptors for any
other retroviruses, van Zeijl et al. (1993, 1994) screened a human cDNA
library at low stringency using GLVR1 (137570) as a probe. A single
GLVR1-related cDNA (designated GLVR2) was isolated and found to have 62%
identity to GLVR1 and its amino acid sequence. Expression of GLVR2 in
CHO-K1 cells, which are resistant to infection by amphotropic virus
because of the absence of a receptor, rendered the cells sensitive to
infection by the virus. Thus, GLVR2 is a receptor for amphotropic virus.
Van Zeijl et al. (1994) pointed out that expression of the GLVR2 protein
might be a requirement for infection of human cells by amphotropic
retroviral vectors for purposes of gene therapy.

MAPPING

Using human-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids and a retroviral
vector, Garcia et al. (1991) mapped the receptor for the amphotropic
murine leukemia virus to the pericentromeric region of human chromosome
8.

Using a somatic cell hybrid panel, van Zeijl et al. (1994) mapped the
GLVR2 gene to human chromosome 8, a location distinct from that for
GLVR1, which maps to human chromosome 2. The location of GLVR2 on
chromosome 8 highlighted the possibility that the locus may encode a
receptor for the murine amphotropic virus because a receptor gene
(MLVAR) for this virus was mapped to chromosome 8 by Garcia et al.
(1991).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 7 families with idiopathic basal ganglia
calcification-1 (213600), Wang et al. (2012) identified 7 different
heterozygous mutations in the SLC20A2 gene (see, e.g.,
158378.0001-158378.0005) that segregated with the disorder. Three
families were of Chinese origin, 3 of Spanish origin, and 1 was
Brazilian. In vitro functional expression studies in Xenopus oocytes
showed that all the missense mutations resulted in substantially
impaired transport of inorganic phosphate. However, expression of 2
mutant missense proteins with wildtype SLC20A2 did not result in
diminished transport activity, suggesting haploinsufficiency as a
pathogenic mechanism. Wang et al. (2012) postulated that functional loss
of SLC20A2 in the brain may result in regional accumulation of inorganic
phosphate in the extracellular matrix, causing calcium phosphate
deposition. No genotype/phenotype correlations were observed.

In 13 (41%) of 29 families with IGBC, Hsu et al. (2013) identified 13
different heterozygous mutations in the SLC20A2 gene (see, e.g.,
158378.0003 and 158378.0006-158378.0008). Variants predicted to be
deleterious cosegregated with the disease in 5 families. No carriers of
SLC20A2 variants were unaffected, suggesting 100% sensitivity of the
clinical or CT evaluation. In contrast, several individuals in 3 large
families who received an affected disease status based upon clinical
examination or CT scan did not carry mutations. Hsu et al. (2013) noted
that CT calcifications may be found in up to 1% of the general
population, and that a wide range of neuropsychiatric manifestations can
be considered part of the disorder. The findings established SLC20A2 as
a key gene for familial IBGC.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BASAL GANGLIA CALCIFICATION, IDIOPATHIC, 1
SLC20A2, GLY498ARG

In affected members of a 5-generation Chinese family with idiopathic
basal ganglia calcification-1 (IBGC1; 213600) originally reported by Dai
et al. (2010), Wang et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 1492G-A
transition in the SLC20A2 gene, resulting in a gly498-to-arg (G498R)
substitution in a highly conserved residue in transmembrane domain VIII.
The mutation was not found in 508 Chinese controls, in the 1000 Genomes
Project database, or in 2,439 control exomes. In vitro functional
expression studies in Xenopus oocytes showed that the mutation resulted
in substantially impaired transport of inorganic phosphate. In this
family, 9 individuals had idiopathic basal ganglia calcification, but
only 4 had clinical symptoms of headache, 1 also with depression; 5 were
asymptomatic. Brain imaging of the 36-year-old proband showed symmetric
calcium deposition in the caudate nucleus, lentiform nucleus, globus
pallidus, inferior part of thalamus, and occipitalis lobes. All were
adults, except for 1 asymptomatic 9-year-old boy, who had calcifications
only in the globus pallidus.

.0002
BASAL GANGLIA CALCIFICATION, IDIOPATHIC, 1
SLC20A2, SER601TRP

In affected members of a 4-generation Chinese family with IBGC1
(213600), Wang et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 1802C-G
transversion in the SLC20A2 gene, resulting in a ser601-to-trp (S601W)
substitution in a highly conserved residue in transmembrane domain XI.
The mutation was not found in 508 Chinese controls, the 1000 Genomes
Project, or 2,439 control exomes. In vitro functional expression studies
in Xenopus oocytes showed that the mutation resulted in substantially
impaired transport of inorganic phosphate. However, expression of the
mutant protein with wildtype SLC20A2 did not result in diminished
transport activity. Five patients were clinically asymptomatic and 1 had
parkinsonism and cerebral infarction at age 73 years. Brain imaging
showed calcium deposition primarily limited to the basal ganglia and
inferior part of the thalamus. However, 2 affected sisters had a much
more severe disorder, with early-onset epilepsy, developmental delay,
and mental retardation. Brain imaging of these 2 girls showed marked
symmetric calcium deposition in the basal ganglia, inferior part of the
thalamus, cerebellum, frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices, and
subcortex. These 2 girls were found to carry a heterozygous S601W
mutation inherited from their affected father, as well as a
ser121-to-cys (S121C) substitution in the SLC20A2 gene inherited from
their unaffected mother. The S121C substitution was not found in 508
Chinese controls, but did not show a significant impairment of SLC20A2
transport activity. Thus, its contribution to the severe phenotype
lacked clearly supportive evidence.

.0003
BASAL GANGLIA CALCIFICATION, IDIOPATHIC, 1
SLC20A2, SER601LEU

In 2 affected members of a Chinese family with IBGC1 (213600), Wang et
al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 1802C-T transition in the SLC20A2
gene, resulting in a ser601-to-leu (S601L) substitution in a highly
conserved residue in transmembrane domain XI. The mutation was not found
in 508 Chinese controls, the 1000 Genomes Project, or in 2,439 control
exomes. In vitro functional expression studies in Xenopus oocytes showed
that the mutation resulted in substantially impaired transport of
inorganic phosphate.

Hsu et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous S601L substitution in the
SLC20A2 gene in a patient (family F23) with IBGC1 who was of Ashkenazi
Jewish and Russian descent.

.0004
BASAL GANGLIA CALCIFICATION, IDIOPATHIC, 1
SLC20A2, GLU575LYS

In 2 affected members of a Spanish family with IBCG1 (213600), Wang et
al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 1723G-A transition in the SLC20A2
gene, resulting in a glu575-to-lys (E575K) substitution in a highly
conserved residue in transmembrane domain X. The mutation was not found
in 288 Spanish controls, the 1000 Genomes Project, or in 2,439 control
exomes. In vitro functional expression studies in Xenopus oocytes showed
that the mutation resulted in substantially impaired transport of
inorganic phosphate. However, expression of the mutant protein with
wildtype SLC20A2 did not result in diminished transport activity.

.0005
BASAL GANGLIA CALCIFICATION, IDIOPATHIC, 1
SLC20A2, THR595MET

In a Spanish patient with IBGC1 (213600), Wang et al. (2012) identified
a heterozygous 1784C-T transition in the SLC20A2 gene, resulting in a
thr595-to-met (T595M) substitution in a highly conserved residue in
transmembrane domain XI. The mutation was not found in 288 Spanish
controls, the 1000 Genomes Project, or 2,439 control exomes. In vitro
functional expression studies in Xenopus oocytes showed that the
mutation resulted in substantially impaired transport of inorganic
phosphate.

.0006
BASAL GANGLIA CALCIFICATION, IDIOPATHIC, 1
SLC20A2, 1-BP DEL, 508T

In 9 affected members of a large multigenerational family (F1) with
IBGC1 (213600), originally reported by Geschwind et al. (1999), Hsu et
al. (2013) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (c.508delC) in exon 4
of the SLC20A2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination
(Leu170Ter). The family was previously reported to show linkage to a
locus on chromosome 14q13, but Hsu et al. (2013) demonstrated that the
mutation responsible for the phenotype was in the SLC20A2 gene on
chromosome 8p. Two individuals who were clinically affected and were
part of the original linkage study were found not to carry the mutation,
which may have contributed to the previous erroneous linkage results.
The variant was not present in the dbSNP, NHLBI Exome Variant Server, or
1000 Genomes Project databases.

.0007
BASAL GANGLIA CALCIFICATION, IDIOPATHIC, 1
SLC20A2, 4-BP DEL, 1828TCCC

In 9 affected members of a family (F2) with IBGC1 (213600), originally
reported by Brodaty et al. (2002), Hsu et al. (2013) identified a
heterozygous 4-bp deletion (c.1828_1831delTCCC) in exon 11 of the
SLC20A2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination
(Ser610AlafsTer17). The variant was not present in the dbSNP, NHLBI
Exome Variant Server, or 1000 Genomes Project databases. One clinically
affected family member did not carry the mutation.

.0008
BASAL GANGLIA CALCIFICATION, IDIOPATHIC, 1
SLC20A2, 2-BP DEL, 583GT

In 8 affected members of a family (F5) of Irish-English descent with
IBGC1 (213600), previously reported by Manyam et al. (2001) and Oliveira
et al. (2004), Hsu et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous 2-bp deletion
(c.583_584GT) in exon 5 of the SLC20A2 gene, resulting in a frameshift
and premature termination (Val195LeufsTer61). The variant was not
present in the dbSNP, NHLBI Exome Variant Server, or 1000 Genomes
databases. Two clinically affected family members did not carry the
mutation.

605920	TITLE *605920 STAUFEN, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 2; STAU2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The STAU2 gene encodes a protein homologous to both human STAU1 (601716)
and Drosophila staufen, a double-stranded RNA-binding protein required
both for the localization of maternal determinants to the posterior pole
of the Drosophila egg and for bicoid RNA to localize correctly to the
anterior pole (summary by Buchner et al., 1999).

CLONING

Buchner et al. (1999) determined that a transcriptional unit thought to
map to chromosome Xp showed 100% sequence homology with a cDNA clone
mapped to chromosome 8q13-q21. Using a segment of this clone to screen a
neural precursor cell cDNA library, they cloned the full-length cDNA,
the sequence of which matched 2 ESTs on chromosome 8q13-q21.1. A related
sequence matched an EST on chromosome Xq, but was considered to be a
pseudogene. The full-length cDNA on chromosome 8, designated STAU2,
encodes a deduced 479-amino acid protein that shares 48.5% and 59.9%
similarity to the Drosophila staufen and the human staufen-1 (STAU;
601716) proteins, respectively. The STAU2 protein contains 3 predicted
double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs), including a conserved
dsRBD, present in Drosophila staufen and human STAU, which has been
demonstrated to be responsible for RNA binding. Using the full-length
STAU2 cDNA as query, Buchner et al. (1999) identified 40 different ESTs
derived from different tissues, demonstrating that STAU2 is ubiquitously
expressed.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Buchner et al. (1999) mapped the STAU2 gene to
chromosome 8q13-q21.

615275	TITLE *615275 IMMUNORESPONSIVE GENE 1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; IRG1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IRG1 is a highly conserved gene that encodes an enzyme that catalyzes
the decarboxylation of cis-aconitate to itaconic acid. Itaconic acid
inhibits isocitrate lyase, a key enzyme of the glyoxylate shunt, a
pathway essential for bacterial growth in macrophages (Michelucci et
al., 2013).

CLONING

Xiao et al. (2011) found that the predicted human IRG1 protein is highly
homologous to Irg1 proteins in chicken and various other mammals. By
RT-PCR of human fetal tissues, they detected IRG1 expression in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) only. IRG1 expression in
adult PBMCs increased rapidly 18 hours after stimulation with
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but IRG1 showed little to no expression before
this time point or 24 hours after stimulation. IRG1 expression was not
detected in unstimulated or LPS-stimulated leukemia cell lines.
Immunoblot analysis revealed a protein of about 80 kD, likely
representing full-length IRG1, in unstimulated fetal PBMCs and in adult
PBMCs 18 after LPS stimulation, with lower expression in adult PBMCs 24
hours after LPS stimulation.

GENE FUNCTION

Michelucci et al. (2013) performed metabolomic analysis of a mouse
macrophage cell line treated with Irg1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and
stimulated with LPS and observed that the metabolite most affected by
Irg1 silencing was itaconic acid. Kinetic analysis showed that Irg1
expression preceded that of itaconic acid in mouse macrophages, and
purified human IRG1 catalyzed decarboxylation of cis-aconitate to
itaconic acid. Treatment of human macrophages with LPS also induced
expression of IRG1, but itaconic acid levels produced were lower than
those in mouse. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS increased expression of
mouse Irg1 and itaconic acid. Treatment of Salmonella enterica and
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, both of which synthesize isocitrate lyase
for biosynthesis through the glyoxylate shunt, with itaconic acid
resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of growth in minimal media.
Treatment of macrophages with Irg1 siRNA allowed increased bacterial
growth. Michelucci et al. (2013) concluded that IRG1 is upregulated upon
macrophage activation and mediates itaconic acid production, thereby
contributing to macrophage antimicrobial activity.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Xiao et al. (2011) mapped the IRG1 gene to
chromosome 13q22.3.

613299	TITLE *613299 FAMILY WITH SEQUENCE SIMILARITY 13, MEMBER A; FAM13A
;;FAM13A1;;
KIAA0914
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned FAM13A, which they designated
KIAA0914. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its 3-prime
end, and the deduced protein contains 683 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected highest expression of FAM13A in brain and ovary, followed by
lung and kidney. Variable expression was detected in all other tissues
examined.

By EST database analysis and PCR of a human mammary gland cDNA library,
Cohen et al. (2004) cloned 2 splice variants of FAM13A. Variant-1 (V1)
corresponds to KIAA0914 and encodes a protein with 2 coiled-coil domains
and 3 nuclear localization signals. V2 encodes a deduced 1,023-amino
acid protein that has an N-terminal extension containing a RhoGAP (see
602732) domain that is absent in V1. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous expression of the 5-kb V1 transcript, with highest expression
in skeletal muscle, thymus, brain, and lung. The 6-kb V2 transcript was
less abundant and was detected predominantly in kidney, pancreas, liver,
lung, and thymus. Other shorter transcripts were variable expressed.
Fam13a expression was detected in mouse mammary gland, and expression
did not change during mammary gland development and differentiation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cohen et al. (2004) determined that the FAM13A gene contains 25 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the FAM13A
gene to chromosome 4.

By genomic sequence analysis, Cohen et al. (2004) mapped the FAM13A gene
to chromosome 4q22.1. The last exon of the FAM13A gene overlaps the last
exon of the FAM13AOS gene (613300) on the opposite strand.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For a discussion of an association between variation in the FAM13A gene
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, see COPD (606963).

602777	TITLE *602777 SMALL NUCLEAR RNA-ACTIVATING PROTEIN COMPLEX, POLYPEPTIDE 4; SNAPC4
;;SMALL NUCLEAR RNA-ACTIVATING PROTEIN COMPLEX, 190-KD SUBUNIT; SNAP190;;
PSE-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, ALPHA;;
PTF-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNAPC4 encodes a subunit of the snRNA-activating protein complex
(SNAPc), which is required for transcription of both RNA polymerase II
and III snRNA genes (see SNAPC1, 600591).

CLONING

Wong et al. (1998) reported that SNAPc consists of at least 4 subunits,
3 of which, SNAPC1, SNAPC2 (605076), and SNAPC3 (602348), had been
cloned. Using sequences derived from purified SNAPc, Wong et al. (1998)
assembled a cDNA open reading frame for SNAPC4 (SNAP190), the largest
known subunit of the SNAP complex (190 kD), by a combination of library
screens and direct RT-PCR. The 1,469-amino acid protein encoded by this
sequence contains a Myb protein domain followed by arginine- and
serine-rich regions, and a carboxy-terminal region with a leucine
zipper-like motif.

GENE FUNCTION

Wong et al. (1998) showed that SNAPC4 is required for both RNA
polymerase II and III transcription of snRNA genes and that it interacts
strongly with SNAPC2 but not with SNAPC1 or SNAPC3. In addition, they
found that whereas full-length SNAPC4 protein did not bind to the PSE, a
truncated protein containing the Rc and Rd repeats within the Myb domain
was able to bind DNA specifically. The carboxy-terminal half of SNAPC4
can interact with DNA-bound transcription activator OCT1 (164175).

602045	TITLE *602045 RING FINGER PROTEIN 1; RING1
;;RING1A;;
RNF1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The RING finger motif is a specialized zinc finger domain found in many
transcriptional regulatory proteins. This motif was defined by Lovering
et al. (1993) in their characterization of the human RING1 gene.
Lovering et al. (1993) identified and cloned the RING1 gene based on its
location within the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class
II region (syntenic to the mouse t complex) on chromosome 6p21.3. The
sequence of RING1 predicts a 377-amino acid polypeptide with a
glycine-rich region and an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain containing a
putative nuclear localization signal. Northern blot analysis showed that
the gene is expressed as a 1.6-kb transcript in a variety of cell lines.

While screening for proteins that interact with the polycomb group (PcG)
protein BMI1 (164831), Satijn et al. (1997) isolated the RING1 protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Lovering et al. (1993) showed that the RING finger domain of RING1 was
able to bind zinc with tetrahedral coordination, as well as DNA.

Satijn et al. (1997) showed that RING1 binds to and colocalizes with BMI
and that RING1 can act as a transcriptional repressor.

Wang et al. (2004) showed that an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which
they designated Polycomb repressive complex-1-like (PRC1L), specifically
monoubiquitinates histone-2A (H2A; see 142711) at lys119. They found
that PRC1L is composed of several PcG proteins, including RING1, RNF2
(608985), BMI1, and HPH2 (EDR2; 602979). Reduction of RNF2 expression
resulted in a dramatic decrease in the level of ubiquitinated H2A in
HeLa cells. Wang et al. (2004) proposed that H2A ubiquitination is
linked to Polycomb silencing.

De Napoles et al. (2004) found that the PRC1 proteins Mel18 (600346) and
Ring1B (RNF2) were transiently enriched on inactive X chromosomes (Xi)
during early mouse development. Xi was also highly enriched in
ubiquitylated H2A (uH2A), and this occurred coincident with PRC1
recruitment. Analysis of cells lacking Ring1b and Ring1a proteins
demonstrated that Ring1b is required to maintain global uH2A levels in
embryonic stem cells and that Ring1a and Ring1b have an overlapping
function in maintaining uH2A on Xi in differentiated cells.

Yokobayashi et al. (2013) identified gene dosage-dependent roles in
primordial germ cell (PGC) development for Ring1 and Rnf2, 2 central
components of PRC1. Both paralogs are essential for PGC development
between days 10.5 and 11.5 of gestation. Rnf2 is subsequently required
in female PGCs to maintain high levels of Oct4 (164177) and Nanog
(607937) expression and to prevent premature induction of meiotic gene
expression and entry into meiotic prophase. Chemical inhibition of
retinoic acid signaling partially suppresses precocious Oct4
downregulation and Stra8 (609987) activation in Rnf2-deficient female
PGCs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that Stra8 is a
direct target of PRC1 and PRC2 in PGCs. Yokobayashi et al. (2013)
concluded that their data demonstrated the importance of PRC1 gene
dosage in PGC development and in coordinating the timing of sex
differentiation of female PGCs by antagonizing extrinsic retinoic acid
signaling.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kikuti et al. (1997) reported that the RING1 gene contains 5 exons
spanning 3 kb.

MAPPING

Lovering et al. (1993) mapped the RING1 gene within the MHC class II
region (syntenic to the mouse t complex) on chromosome 6p21.3.

Kikuti et al. (1997) examined YAC clone Y42, which contains the MHC
class II region. This region has a relatively high gene density. They
identified the following human genes (in order from centromere toward
telomere): HSET (603763)--HKE1.5--HKE2--HKE3--RING1--HKE6 (601417)--HKE4
(601416)--RXRB (180246)--COL11A2 (120290)--DPB2.

612945	TITLE *612945 RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB4B; RAB4B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RAB proteins, such as RAB4B, are members of the RAS superfamily of small
GTPases that are involved in vesicular trafficking (He et al., 2002).

CLONING

By searching databases for RAS family members, followed by PCR, He et
al. (2002) cloned RAB4B. The deduced 212-amino acid RAB4B protein
contains 4 highly conserved GTPase motifs and a C-terminal
geranylgeranylation motif. Northern blot analysis detected a major
transcript of about 1.2 kb that showed highest expressed in ovary,
followed by thymus and prostate. Lower expression was detected in
spleen, testis, small intestine, colon, peripheral blood, lung,
pancreas, heart, and kidney. Little to no expression was detected in
brain, placenta, liver, and skeletal muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

He et al. (2002) determined that the RAB4B gene contains 8 exons and
spans over 20 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, He et al. (2002) mapped the RAB4B gene to
chromosome 19q13.2-q13.3.

Barbosa et al. (1995) mapped the mouse Rab4b gene to proximal chromosome
7.

605515	TITLE *605515 FORKHEAD BOX P1; FOXP1
;;GLUTAMINE-RICH FACTOR 1; QRF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FOXP1 is a transcriptional repressor that plays a critical role in
monocyte differentiation and macrophage function (Shi et al., 2008).

CLONING

Li and Tucker (1993) cloned a glutamine-rich factor, which they
designated QRF1, that was expressed preferentially at the terminal
differentiation stage of B cells and in skeletal muscle. The deduced
707-amino acid QRF1 protein contains an 84-amino acid segment that shows
significant sequence homology with the DNA-binding domains of the
hepatocyte nuclear factor-3/forkhead (see FOXA1; 602294) family of
proteins.

By expression cloning using blood and testis cDNA libraries to identify
the target of a monoclonal antibody (JC12), Banham et al. (2001)
obtained a full-length cDNA encoding FOXP1. The predicted 677-amino acid
protein contains coiled-coil, glutamine-rich, and serine/threonine-rich
domains in its N-terminal half; a central zinc finger domain; and
coiled-coil, serine/threonine/proline-rich, winged helix, and acidic
domains in its C-terminal half. FOXP1 also has numerous putative
phosphorylation sites, 2 nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in its
C-terminal half, and 2 PEST motif in its C-terminal acidic region.
Multiple-tissue array analysis showed ubiquitous expression of FOXP1 in
normal adult and fetal tissues, with highest expression in lymphoid and
gastrointestinal tissues. Immunohistochemistry showed that FOXP1 protein
was widely expressed, with a predominantly nuclear localization, in
normal tissues.

Wang et al. (2003) stated that there are 4 splice variants of mouse
Foxp1, designated Foxp1a through Foxp1d. They identified and cloned
Foxp1d, which encodes a Foxp1 isoform lacking the N-terminal
polyglutamine domain found in Foxp1a and Foxp1b. Northern blot analysis
and RNase protection assays showed tissue-specific expression of all 4
variants in mouse. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected
tissue-specific expression of FOXP1 variants, with highest levels in
peripheral blood lymphocytes and in caudate nucleus of brain. Western
blot analysis detected variable expression of Foxp1a, Foxp1c, and Foxp1d
in mouse tissues, with high expression of all 3 isoforms in lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2003) found that mouse Foxp1a, Foxp1c, Foxp1d, and the
related Foxp2 (605317) protein bound a 7-nucleotide core sequence,
TATTT(G/A)T. These Foxp proteins repressed gene transcription via
binding to this consensus site, which was identified within the SV40 and
IL2 (147680) promoters. In some cases, the strength of Foxp1 repression
was mediated by the polyglutamine domain. Mouse Foxp1 proteins also
formed homodimers or heterodimers with subfamily members, and the
conserved C2H2 zinc finger and leucine zipper motifs mediated
dimerization.

Using genetic manipulations, Rousso et al. (2008) demonstrated that
Foxp1 established the pattern of LIM-homeodomain protein (see 601999)
expression in embryonic mice and, accordingly, organized motor axon
projections, their connectivity with peripheral targets, and the
establishment of motor pools. Hox proteins (see 142950) dictated the
pattern of Foxp1 expression in spinal cord, and both Foxp1 and Hox were
required for segment-appropriate generation of motor columns and pools
in mouse.

Shi et al. (2008) generated transgenic mice overexpressing human FOXP1
in monocyte/macrophage lineage cells. Circulating blood monocytes from
these mice had reduced expression of macrophage colony-stimulating
factor receptor (CSF1R; 164770), impaired migratory capacity, and
diminished accumulation as splenic macrophages. Macrophage functions
were globally impaired, and osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption were
attenuated. Forced overexpression of Csf1r reversed many of the
deficits, suggesting that repression of Csf1r is likely the dominant
mechanism responsible for FOXP1 effects on monocyte differentiation and
macrophage function.

- Association of FOXP1 With Cancer

By analysis of a tumor/normal tissue expression array, Banham et al.
(2001) found that expression of FOXP1 was lower in colon tumors and
higher in stomach and prostate tumors compared with matched normal
tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis showed frequent loss of
expression, increased expression, and cytoplasmic mislocalization of the
predominantly nuclear FOXP1 protein in solid tumors.

By immunohistochemical analysis of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (BCL)
tissue microarray, Banham et al. (2005) found that untreated patients
with a high percentage of FOXP1-positive nuclei had significantly
reduced survival and earlier progression compared with FOXP1-negative
patients.

Of 275 BCLs, Haralambieva et al. (2005) found that only 5 (3
gastrointestinal, 1 thyroid, and 1 cervical lymph node) carried a
chromosomal breakpoint in the FOXP1 gene and strong nuclear FOXP1
expression. All were diffuse large BCLs rather than marginal zone BCLs.
Haralambieva et al. (2005) concluded that genetic alterations at 3p13
are associated with strong FOXP1 expression.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Banham et al. (2001) mapped the FOXP1 gene
to chromosome 3p14.1.

CYTOGENETICS

Streubel et al. (2005) noted that 3 chromosomal translocations,
t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(14;18)(q32;q21), and t(1;14)(p22;q32), are
associated with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. They
identified a t(3;14)(p14;q32) in a case of MALT lymphoma of the thyroid.
FISH studies showed that the IGH locus (147100) was rearranged, and
long-distance inverse PCR identified FOXP1 as the partner gene on
chromosome 3. Using FISH assays to screen 91 MALT lymphomas negative for
3 common translocations, Streubel et al. (2005) identified
t(3;14)(p14;q32) in 9 cases (3 thyroid, 4 ocular adnexa, and 2 skin).
Most t(3;14)(p14;q32)-positive MALT lymphomas also harbored additional
genetic abnormalities, such as trisomy 3. All 4 of the MALT-associated
translocations were mutually exclusive. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed
upregulated expression of FOXP1 in MALT cases with t(3;14)(p14;q32) or
trisomy 3. Streubel et al. (2005) concluded that FOXP1 is a
translocation partner of IGH in a site-dependent subset of MALT
lymphomas.

Carr et al. (2010) reported a boy with severe speech delay and delayed
motor development (see 613670) who carried a de novo heterozygous 1.0-Mb
interstitial deletion of chromosome 3p14.1 that involved only the FOXP1
gene. The phenotype was confounded by a Chiari I malformation, which was
surgically corrected at age 30 months. The patient had delayed gross
motor skills and walked at 16 months. After surgery for the Chiari
malformation, he had some improvement in motor skills. The most
significant feature was speech delay with limited verbal output and
difficulty in articulating entire words and multisyllabic speech,
although he did not have a deficit in oromotor coordination. At age 4
years, he developed staring spells with motor arrest associated with
epileptiform discharges. He had mild dysmorphic facial features,
including broad forehead, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral
fissures, ptosis, short nose, broad nasal tip, and smooth philtrum. Carr
et al. (2010) concluded that FOXP1 may play a role in the development of
verbal and motor skills.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hamdan et al. (2010) identified 2 different de novo heterozygous
mutations in the FOXP1 gene (605515.0001 and 605515.0002, respectively)
in 2 unrelated children of French Canadian origin with moderate mental
retardation, expressive language deficits, and autistic features
(613670). The first mutation (605515.0001) was a small deletion found
using array-based comparative genomic hybridization of a cohort of 80
patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 30 with intellectual
disability. The second mutation (R525X; 605515.0002) was found by direct
sequencing of the FOXP1 gene in a cohort of 110 patients with
intellectual disability, 84 with ASD, and 51 with both. Hamdan et al.
(2010) chose to examine the FOXP1 gene specifically because of the role
of the FOXP2 gene (605317) in a speech and language disorder (SPCH1;
602081); patients with intellectual disability and ASD often show
language impairment. The results indicated that disruption of FOXP1 has
a global impact on brain development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hu et al. (2006) found that mice lacking Foxp1 died at embryonic day
14.5 due to heart valve and outflow tract abnormalities. Reconstitution
of Rag2 (179616)-deficient mice with Foxp1 -/- or Foxp1 +/- fetal liver
cells resulted in decreased mature B cells, but normal thymocytes, in
the recipients. Foxp1 -/- pro-B cells had reduced IgM, Rag1 (179615),
and Rag2 expression, and V(D)J rearrangement was also impaired in Foxp1
-/- B cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and EMSA analyses showed that
Foxp1 bound to Foxp site-2 (Fkh2) in the Erag enhancer, which is
upstream of Rag2, in a B-lineage specific way. Hu et al. (2006)
concluded that FOXP1 influences B-cell development at an early stage,
and that FOXP1 deficiency results in a phenotype that resembles double
haploinsufficiency of E2A (TCF3; 147141) and EBF (164343).

Feng et al. (2010) generated mice with a conditional deletion of Foxp1
in double-positive thymocytes and found that peripheral Cd4 (see 186940)
and Cd8 (see 186910) cells also lacked Foxp1 and that single-positive
thymocytes acquired an activated phenotype in thymus. Peripheral cells
also exhibited an activated phenotype and increased apoptosis and
readily produced cytokines upon T-cell receptor engagement. Feng et al.
(2010) concluded that FOXP1 is an essential transcriptional regulator
for thymocyte development and the generation of quiescent naive T cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION WITH LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT AND AUTISTIC FEATURES
FOXP1, 390-KB DEL

In a French Canadian girl who had mental retardation with language
impairment and autistic features (613670), Hamdan et al. (2010)
identified a de novo heterozygous 390-kb intragenic deletion in the
FOXP1 gene. The deletion encompassed exons 4 to 14 of the longest FOXP1
isoform, including the translation initiation site and leucine zipper
and zinc finger domains important for transcriptional activity.

.0002
MENTAL RETARDATION WITH LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT AND AUTISTIC FEATURES
FOXP1, ARG525TER

In a French Canadian boy who had mental retardation with language
impairment and autistic features (613670), Hamdan et al. (2010)
identified a de novo heterozygous 1573C-T transition in the FOXP1 gene,
resulting in an arg525-to-ter (R525X) substitution. The mutation was
predicted to abolish the last 152 residues of the protein, including
part of the forkhead DNA-binding (FHD) domain and a conserved nuclear
localization signal. The mutation was not found in 570 controls. In
vitro functional expression studies in HEK293 cells showed that the
R525X mutant impaired the transcriptional repression ability of FOXP1,
consistent with a loss of function.

PROTEASOME SUBUNIT BETA-1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

DeMartino et al. (1991) cloned a partial cDNA encoding the PSMB6
subunit, termed 'subunit delta.' Akiyama et al. (1994) cloned the
full-length cDNA, which encoded a 239-amino acid polypeptide. The amino
acid sequence has significant homology to other proteasome beta
subunits. See PSMB5 (600306).

GENE FUNCTION

Coux et al. (1996) reviewed the structures and functions of the 20S
proteasome subunits. The beta subunits are believed to form the inner
rings of the proteasome and to mediate proteolysis.

MAPPING

Belich et al. (1994) mapped the PSMB6 gene to 17p13 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization.

611305	TITLE *611305 ACTIN-BINDING LIM PROTEIN FAMILY, MEMBER 3; ABLIM3
;;KIAA0843
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The LIM domain is a double zinc finger structure that promotes
protein-protein interactions. LIM domain proteins, such as ABLIM3, play
roles in embryonic development, cell lineage determination, and cancer
(Krupp et al., 2006).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned ABLIM3, which they designated
KIAA0843. The transcript contains a repetitive element at its 3-prime
end, and the deduced 683-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with ABLIM1 (602330). RT-PCR ELISA detected highest
expression in adult liver, with moderate expression in all other adult
and fetal tissues examined except adult pancreas and testis, which
showed little to no expression. Expression was high in cerebellum and
moderate in all other adult brain regions examined.

By searching for genes similar to ABLIM1, Krupp et al. (2006) identified
ABLIM3. The deduced protein contains 4 LIM domains, a C-terminal VHD
domain, and a putative nuclear localization signal. Mouse and human
ABLIM3 share 98% amino acid identity. ABLIM3 is conserved in
vertebrates, but not in invertebrates.

GENE FUNCTION

Barrientos et al. (2007) showed that both ABLIM2 (612544) and ABLIM3
bound strongly to F-actin, localized to actin stress fibers in a mouse
myoblast cell line, and synergistically enhanced Stars (ABRA;
609747)-dependent activation of Srf (600589) in reporter gene assays.
Knockdown of endogenous Ablim1, Ablim2, and Ablim3 expression via small
interfering RNA blunted Srf-dependent transcription in mouse skeletal
muscle cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krupp et al. (2006) determined that the ABLIM3 gene contains 24 exons
and spans 119 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the ABLIM3
gene to chromosome 5. Krupp et al. (2006) mapped the ABLIM3 gene to
chromosome 5q32 by genomic sequence analysis.

613974	TITLE *613974 DEAD BOX POLYPEPTIDE 60; DDX60
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DDX60 is a type I interferon (e.g., IFNA1; 147660)-stimulated gene (ISG)
that encodes a protein that has activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV;
see 609532) (Schoggins et al., 2011).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of HeLa cell total RNA, Miyashita et al. (2011) cloned
full-length DDX60. The deduced 1,712-amino acid protein contains an RNA
helicase domain spanning amino acids 760 to 1330 that consists of a
DEXD/H box motif and a C-terminal RNA helicase motif. Northern blot
analysis detected variable expression of a 5.5-kb transcript in all
human tissues examined. Confocal microscopy localized epitope-tagged
DDX60 in the cytoplasm of transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an overexpression screening approach to test more than 380 ISGs,
including DDX60, for their ability to inhibit replication of various
human and animal viruses, including HCV, yellow fever virus, West Nile
virus (see 610379), chikungunya virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis
virus, and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (see 609423), Schoggins et al.
(2011) found that DDX60 had activity against HCV.

Using microarray analysis, Miyashita et al. (2011) found that viral
infection upregulated RIGI (DDX58; 609631)-like receptors (RLRs) and
Ddx60 in mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. In human cell lines,
DDX60 coprecipitated with the antiviral RNA exosome components EXOSC1
(606493) and EXOSC4 (606491). DDX60 also associated with RIGI and the
RLRs MDA5 (IFIH1; 606951) and LGP2 (DHX58; 608588). In HEK293 cells,
endogenous RIGI bound DDX60 after vesicular stomatitis virus infection,
but not in its absence. Knockdown analysis of human cells showed that
DDX60 was required for RIGI- and MDA5-dependent type I interferon and
interferon-inducible gene expression in response to viral infection. The
antiviral activity of DDX60 was independent of the RNA exosome. The
isolated RNA helicase domain of DDX60 (amino acids 752 to 1337) bound
single-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA, and double-stranded DNA in
vitro. Miyashita et al. (2011) concluded that DDX60 is an antiviral
helicase that promotes RIGI-like receptor-mediated signaling.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the DDX60 gene to chromosome 4q32.3 based on an
alignment of the DDX60 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC038115) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

603002	TITLE *603002 TRANSPORTIN 2; TNPO2
;;TRN2;;
KARYOPHERIN BETA-2B; KPNB2B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transportin-1 (KPNB2; 602901) interacts directly and specifically with
M9, the bidirectional transport signal of the nuclear shuttling protein
hnRNPA1 (164017) and mediates hnRNPA1 nuclear import. In the course of
isolating additional transportin-1 cDNAs, Siomi et al. (1997) isolated
cDNAs encoding a related protein that they designated 'transportin-2.'
The sequence of the predicted 894-amino acid protein shares 84% identity
with that of transportin-1. One notable difference is that transportin-2
contains a short extra sequence within the region corresponding to the
M9-interacting domain of transportin-1. Far Western blotting showed that
transportin-2 and transportin-1 have different substrate specificities.
Siomi et al. (1997) suggested that the insert in transportin-2 modifies
its interaction with import substrates.

GENE FUNCTION

Transport of macromolecules between the cell nucleus and cytoplasm
occurs through the nuclear pores and is mediated by soluble carriers
known as karyopherins, transportins, importins, or exportins. Shamsher
et al. (2002) found that transportin-2 forms complexes with the mRNA
export factor TAP (NXF1; 602647) that strictly depend on the presence of
RanGTP. The data supported the conclusion that transportin-2
participates directly in the export of a large proportion of cellular
mRNAs, and that TAP connects transportin-2 to mRNAs to be exported.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TRN2
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP WI-30101).

602986	TITLE *602986 DEVELOPMENTALLY REGULATED GTP-BINDING PROTEIN 2; DRG2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a subtractive hybridization strategy, Schenker et al. (1994)
identified embryonic lung fibroblast cDNAs whose expression was
selectively repressed in SV40-transformed cells. One cDNA encoded a
predicted 364-amino acid protein that was designated DRG2. DRG2 contains
the 5 sequence motifs that are conserved in all GTP-binding proteins.
Northern blot analysis detected DRG2 expression as a major 2-kb and a
minor 1.5-kb transcript in various tissues. The shorter mRNA appeared to
result from use of an alternative polyadenylation site.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Schenker and Trueb (1997) mapped
the DRG2 gene to 17p13-p12. Vlangos et al. (2000) mapped the DRG2 gene
to 17p11.2 within the Smith-Magenis syndrome critical region by somatic
cell hybrid analysis.

164875	TITLE *164875 VAV1 ONCOGENE; VAV1
;;ONCOGENE VAV;;
ONCOGENE VAV1
DESCRIPTION The VAV oncogene was generated by genomic rearrangement that replaced
the 5-prime domain of the VAV protooncogene by sequences from a
bacterial gene present in the cotransfecting DNA used as a selectable
marker during gene transfer assay (Katzav et al., 1989). A high level of
expression of the VAV oncogene leads to morphologic transformation of
NIH 3T3 cells in culture and to the efficient induction of tumors in
immunocompromised mice. The VAV gene directs the synthesis of a 3.0-kb
transcript that is specifically expressed in cells of hematopoietic
origin, including those of erythroid, lymphoid, and myeloid lineages.
The predicted amino acid sequence of the gene product exhibits motifs
characteristic of transcriptional factors, including a highly acidic
amino-terminal region, separated from 2 putative nuclear localization
signals by a proline-rich sequence, and 2 zinc finger-like domains.

Bustelo and Barbacid (1992) presented results suggesting that the VAV
protooncogene participates in the signaling processes that mediate the
antigen-induced activation of B lymphocytes.

Fackler et al. (1999) identified the protooncogene and guanine
nucleotide exchange factor VAV as the specific binding partner of Nef
proteins from HIV-1. The interaction between Nef and VAV led to
increased activity of VAV and its downstream effectors. Both
cytoskeletal changes and the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (see
602896) were observed. Fackler et al. (1999) concluded that the
interaction between Nef and VAV initiates a signaling cascade that
changes structural and physiologic parameters in the infected cell.

By analysis of a rodent-human hybrid DNA panel and by chromosomal in
situ hybridization, Martinerie et al. (1990) assigned the VAV locus to
19p13.2-p12. VAV and INSR, the insulin receptor gene (147670), appeared
to be closely linked; INSR and VAV migrated together in high molecular
weight DNA fragments created with rare cutting restriction enzymes that
were subjected to pulsed field gel electrophoresis. It may be worth
noting that transcription factor-3 (147141), which has been implicated
in acute lymphoblastic leukemia associated with translocations (p1;19),
is located at 19p13.3-p13.2. By fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Trask et al. (1993) assigned the VAV gene to 19p13.3-p13.2.

Studies by Tarakhovsky et al. (1995), Zhang et al. (1995), and Fischer
et al. (1995) demonstrated functional consequences of VAV gene deletion.
The investigators used homologous recombination to introduce a null
mutation into embryonic stem (ES) cells. Tarakhovsky et al. (1995)
reported that in the absence of VAV antigen, receptor mediated
proliferative responses of B and T cells are severely reduced. Fischer
et al. (1995) demonstrated that VAV-dependent signaling pathways
regulate the maturation of T cells. The studies reported by Zhang et al.
(1995) confirmed that VAV plays a role in T- and B-cell development and
activation.

Using genomic sequence analysis, Denkinger et al. (2000) determined that
the VAV1 gene contains 27 exons and spans 77 kb on chromosome 19. Its
overall exon organization is similar to that of VAV2 (600428). They also
identified several differences from the original VAV cDNA sequence,
notably, that there is an isoleucine at position 718 rather than a
threonine, which changes the classification of the VAV SH2 domain from
type 3 to type 2. Promoter analysis indicated that a 23-bp segment that
includes a potential CBF/AML1 (see 151385)-binding site is essential for
VAV expression in a monocytoid cell line.

Moores et al. (2000) expressed VAV1, VAV2, and VAV3 (605541) at
equivalent levels and found that each responds to similar surface
receptor tyrosine kinases. Integrin-induced phosphorylation required the
presence of SYK (600085). Only VAV1 could efficiently cooperate with
T-cell receptor (TCR; see 186880) signaling to enhance NFAT
(600489)-dependent transcription, while only VAV1 and VAV3 could enhance
nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011)-dependent transcription.

Bustelo (2000) presented a comprehensive review of the regulatory and
signaling properties of the VAV family.

603731	TITLE *603731 CCR4-NOT TRANSCRIPTION COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 8; CNOT8
;;CAF1-LIKE FACTOR; CALIF;;
PKG PROMOTER-DIRECTED OVERPRODUCTION 2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF;
POP2
DESCRIPTION The yeast CCR4-NOT protein complex is a global regulator of RNA
polymerase II transcription. It is comprised, in part, of CCR4 (see
608951), NOT1 to NOT5, and CAF1 (also referred to as POP2). By searching
sequence databases, Albert et al. (2000) identified human ESTs encoding
homologs of yeast NOT1, NOT2, NOT3, NOT4, and CAF1. The deduced
293-amino acid human homolog of yeast CAF1 shares 75% amino acid
sequence identity with human CAF1 (604913). Thus, the authors stated
that they had identified a second human homolog of yeast CAF1 and called
this novel homolog CALIF for CAF1-like factor. Comparative analysis of
the protein sequences of human CALIF, human CAF1, and yeast CAF1
revealed 34% overall identity between CALIF and yeast CAF1 and 35%
identity between human CAF1 and yeast CAF1. Albert et al. (2000)
concluded that it cannot be determined from these numbers alone whether
CALIF or human CAF1 is the true human ortholog of yeast CAF1. Both CALIF
and human CAF1 are shorter than yeast CAF1, which contains an N-terminal
extension of approximately 140 amino acids. Using the yeast 2-hybrid
assay, Albert et al. (2000) demonstrated that recombinant CALIF can
interact with yeast NOT1, an N-terminally truncated human NOT1 protein
(604917), human NOT3 (604910), and yeast CCR4. Immunoprecipitation
studies indicated that CALIF and NOT3 physically associate in vivo.
Northern blot analysis detected a major 2.5-kb CALIF transcript in all
human tissues tested, namely brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, small
intestine, colon, spleen, thymus, peripheral blood leukocytes, skeletal
muscle, and placenta. Like the expression of human NOT1, NOT2 (604909),
and NOT3, CALIF expression was high in brain, kidney, and placenta and
very low in skeletal muscle and colon. The authors suggested that CALIF
is a bona fide component of the human CCR4-NOT complex. They found that
recombinant CALIF could not complement the caffeine-sensitive phenotype
conferred by the yeast caf1 null mutation.

The 5q- syndrome (153550) is a myelodysplastic syndrome associated with
an interstitial deletion of the 5q31-q33 region. Fidler et al. (1999)
found that the human POP2 gene is located within this region. The
predicted 292-amino acid human protein shares 75%, 44%, and 38% sequence
identity with mouse Caf1, C. elegans CAF1, and yeast POP2, respectively.
Northern blot analysis revealed that human POP2 was expressed as an
approximately 2.5-kb mRNA in all tissues tested. The authors concluded
that POP2 is a candidate for the tumor suppressor gene associated with
the development of 5q- syndrome.

134350	TITLE *134350 COMPLEMENT FACTOR D; CFD
;;FACTOR D; DF;;
ADIPSIN; ADN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CFD gene encodes complement factor D, a serine protease that acts in
the alternative complement pathway to complete the formation of the C3
convertase enzyme by cleaving factor B (CFB; 138470) bound to C3b
(120700), yielding C3bBb. Factor D is the initial obligatory and
rate-limiting catalytic component in the alternative complement pathway
(summary by White et al., 1992 and Biesma et al., 2001).

CLONING

White et al. (1992) isolated clones corresponding to the human CFD gene
from a human glioma cDNA library. The deduced mature protein contains
228 amino acids and was determined to be the same as the adipsin protein
identified in mice (Rosen et al., 1989). Northern blot analysis detected
a 1.1-kb mRNA transcript in adipocytes, monocytes, and macrophages. The
recombinant protein showed enzymatic activity of complement factor D,
cleaving factor B only when B was complexed with activated component
C3b. The findings suggested that adipose tissue may have a role in
immune system biology.

GENE FUNCTION

White et al. (1992) found that adipose cells are the main source of
factor D. There is a gradient in the concentration of factor D in the
fat cells of the body; more is present in the upper than in the lower
half of the body (Mathieson and Peters, 1997). In a review of the
complement system, Walport (2001) noted that the C3 nephritic
autoantibody can be associated with acquired partial lipodystrophy
(613913). The C3 nephritic autoantibody stabilizes the C3bBb C3
convertase that forms in the immediate vicinity of adipocytes. The
abnormally stabilized enzyme may then cleave enough C3 to allow assembly
of the membrane-attack complex, which lyses adipocytes. The pattern of
fat loss, which involves the upper half of the body, may reflect the
content of factor D.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Forneris et al. (2010) presented crystal structures of the proconvertase
C3bB at 4-angstrom resolution and its complex with factor D at
3.5-angstrom resolution. Their data showed how factor B (138470) binding
to C3b forms an open 'activation' state of C3bB. Factor D specifically
binds the open conformation of factor B through a site distant from the
catalytic center and is activated by the substrate, which displaces
factor D's self-inhibitory loop. This concerted proteolytic mechanism,
which if cofactor-dependent and substrate-induced, restricts complement
amplification to C3b-tagged target cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Factor D is unusual among serum proteins in having a single-banded
pattern in isoelectric focusing. Hobart and Lachmann (1976) found a
variant in 3 persons of West African parentage (2 Nigerians and a West
Indian) among 120 tested. No variants were found among 115 British and
26 Asian Indians. The presence of the variant band was associated with
weakening of the normal band. Both bands were of equal strength (Martin
et al., 1976).

- Complement Factor D Deficiency

In a Dutch family with factor D deficiency (CFDD; 613912), Biesma et al.
(2001) identified a homozygous mutation in the CFD gene (134350.0001).
The proband was a 23-year-old woman who presented with septic shock due
to Neisseria meningitidis in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. A deceased
family member had a history of recurrent bacterial meningitis.
Laboratory studies showed absence of factor D activity in the proband.
However, 3 other family members who did not have a history of recurrent
infections also showed absence of factor D activity.

Sprong et al. (2006) described the clinical course of meningococcal
disease in 2 children of a Turkish family with a novel factor D gene
mutation (134350.0002) leading to undetectable factor D plasma
concentrations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Adipsin is a serine protease that is secreted by adipocytes into the
bloodstream. It is deficient in several animal models of obesity. Rosen
et al. (1989) purified recombinant mouse adipsin and studied its
biochemical and enzymatic properties. Activated adipsin had little or no
proteolytic activity toward most substrates but had the same activity as
human complement factor D.

To assess the contribution of the alternative pathway in complement
activation and host defense and its possible role in the regulation of
systemic energy balance in vivo, Xu et al. (2001) generated factor
D-deficient mice by gene targeting. Mutant mice had no apparent
abnormality in development and their body weights were similar to those
of factor D-sufficient littermates. Complement activation could not be
initiated in the serum of deficient mice by alternative pathway
activators, namely, rabbit erythrocytes and zymosan. Injection of cobra
venom factor caused a profound and reproducible reduction in serum C3
levels, whereas, as expected, there was no C3 reduction in factor
B-deficient mice treated similarly. Studies of C3 and factor B
activation in vitro by cobra venom factor demonstrated that in factor
D-deficient serum the alpha chain of C3 was cleaved gradually over a
period of 60 minutes without detectable cleavage of factor B. Kinetics
of opsonization of Streptococcus pneumoniae by C3 fragments was much
slower in factor D-deficient serum, suggesting a significant
contribution of the alternative pathway to antibacterial host defense
early after infection.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COMPLEMENT FACTOR D DEFICIENCY
CFD, SER42TER

In 5 affected members of a consanguineous Dutch family with complement
factor D deficiency (613912), Biesma et al. (2001) identified a
homozygous C-to-A transversion in the CFD gene, resulting in a
ser42-to-ter (S42X) substitution. The proband was a 23-year-old woman
who presented with septic shock due to Neisseria meningitidis in blood
and CSF. A deceased family member had a history of recurrent bacterial
meningitis. Laboratory studies showed absence of factor D activity in
the proband. However, 3 other family members who did not have a history
of recurrent infections also showed absence of factor D activity.

.0002
COMPLEMENT FACTOR D DEFICIENCY
CFD, VAL213GLY AND CYS214ARG

In a sister and brother, born of consanguineous parents, with invasive
meningococcal disease due to complement factor D deficiency (613912)
Sprong et al. (2006) identified homozygosity for a mutant allele
containing 2 missense mutations in cis in the CFD gene: a 638T-G
transversion, resulting in a val213-to-gly (V213G) substitution, and a
640T-C transition, resulting in a cys214-to-arg (C214R) substitution.
These mutations both occurred in conserved residues, and the C214R
change destroyed an internal disulfide bond between 2 conserved
cysteines. The unaffected parents and an unaffected sib were
heterozygous for the complex allele. The 19-month-old girl developed N.
meningitis and died in refractory shock about 47 hours after hospital
admission. Four years later, the 13-month-old brother was admitted to
the same hospital because of sudden onset of fever and a petechial rash.
At the age of 4 months, he had been hospitalized for a respiratory
syncytial virus infection complicated by bacterial superinfection. Blood
cultures grew N. meningitidis. Immunologic studies indicated that factor
D was undetectable. Because of this deficiency, the boy was put on
antibiotic prophylaxis and was vaccinated for N. meningitidis.

613358	TITLE *613358 ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE 16 FAMILY, MEMBER A1; ALDH16A1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mass spectrometry to identify proteins that coimmunoprecipitated
with maspardin (ACP33; 608181) from HeLa cell lysates, followed by
database analysis, Hanna and Blackstone (2009) identified ALDH16A1.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected a punctate cytoplasmic ALDH16A1
distribution in HeLa cells. Western blot analysis showed that the
protein had an apparent molecular mass of 85 kD. RT-PCR detected
Aldh16a1 in mouse brain. In situ hybridization of cultured mouse
cortical neurons revealed prominent punctate Aldh16a1 staining in cell
bodies and growth cones.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down assays, Hanna
and Blackstone (2009) showed that endogenous maspardin and ALDH16A1
interacted directly.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the ALDH16A1 gene to chromosome 19q13.33 based on an
alignment of the ALDH16A1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY007096) with the
genomic sequence (GRCH37).

610055	TITLE *610055 COILED-COIL AND C2 DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1A; CC2D1A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes along a region of chromosome 19 associated with
autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation, Basel-Vanagaite et
al. (2006) identified CC2D1A. The deduced 950-amino acid protein
contains a C2 domain and a DM14 motif. A deduced 338-amino acid isoform
does not contain the DM motif. In situ hybridization of day 12 mouse
embryos detected Cc2d1a throughout the ventricular zone and developing
cortical plate and ganglionic eminences. By embryonic day 16, expression
was strongest in the cortical plate; from postnatal day 3 into
adulthood, expression was strongest in the cerebral cortex and
hippocampus, particularly in hippocampal region CA3. Western blot
analysis of normal human lymphoblastoid cells detected CC2D1A at an
apparent molecular mass of 104 kD. Immunohistochemical analysis detected
CC2D1a in the cytoplasm of human osteosarcoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Gallagher and Knoblich (2006) and Jaekel and Klein (2006) found that
Drosophila Lgd, an ortholog of CC2D1A and CC2D1B, regulated endocytosis
and was required for endosomal trafficking of Notch (190198). Jaekel and
Klein (2006) showed that, in the absence of Lgd, Notch was activated in
a ligand-independent manner. They also found that murine Cc2d1a and
Cc2d1b could substitute for loss of Lgd function in flies.

GENE STRUCTURE

Basel-Vanagaite et al. (2006) determined that the CC2D1A gene contains
31 exons and spans 37 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Basel-Vanagaite et al. (2006) mapped the
CC2D1A gene to chromosome 19p13.12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 9 consanguineous Israeli-Arab families with
nonsyndromic mental retardation-3 (MRT3; 608443) from the same village
and with the same family name, Basel-Vanagaite et al. (2006) identified
homozygosity for a protein-truncating mutation in the CC2D1A gene
(610055.0001). The parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was
not found in 300 control chromosomes.

homozygosity for a deletion of 3,589 nucleotides beginning in intron 13
and ending in intron 16 of the CC2D1A gene. The deletion introduces a
frameshift, creating a 30-amino acid nonsense peptide and a stop codon
at position 438 of the mutant protein. The parents were heterozygous for
the mutation, which was not found in 300 control chromosomes.

107740	TITLE *107740 APOLIPOPROTEIN D; APOD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) is a member of the alpha(2mu)-microglobulin
superfamily of carrier proteins also known as lipocalins (e.g.,
lipocalin-1; 151675). It is a protein component of high-density
lipoprotein in human plasma, comprising about 5% of total high-density
lipoprotein (Fielding and Fielding, 1980). It is a glycoprotein of
estimated molecular weight 33,000 Da. ApoD is closely associated with
the enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT; 606967) (summary
by Drayna et al., 1986).

CLONING

Drayna et al. (1986) reported the amino acid sequence of apoD based on
the nucleotide sequence of the coding portion of the APOD gene and on
the cloned cDNA sequence. The 169-amino acid protein bore little
similarity to other lipoprotein sequences but had a high degree of
homology to plasma retinol-binding protein (180250, 180260, 180280,
180290), a member of the alpha(2mu)-globulin superfamily. This
structural similarity may indicate some functional homology of these
proteins. ApoD mRNA has been detected in many tissues. Drayna et al.
(1987) described multiple RFLPs at the APOD locus. Kamboh et al. (1989)
demonstrated for the first time polymorphism of apolipoprotein D by an
isoelectric focusing-immunoblotting technique.

Zeng et al. (1996) identified apoD as apocrine secretion odor-binding
protein-2 (ASOB2), 1 of 2 glycoproteins that bind E-3-methyl-2-hexenoic
acid (E-3M2H), the most abundant axillary odor component in human males.
The authors used mass spectrometry to determine the amino acid sequence
and glycosylation pattern of ASOB2. The pattern of glycosylation for
axillary apoD differs from that reported for plasma apoD, suggesting to
Zeng et al. (1996) that there are different sites of expression for the
2 glycoproteins. In situ hybridization of an oligonucleotide probe
against apoD mRNA with axillary tissue demonstrated that the message for
synthesis of this protein is specific to the apocrine glands. These
results suggested a remarkable similarity between human axillary
secretions and nonhuman mammalian odor sources, where lipocalins have
been shown to carry the odoriferous signals used in pheromonal
communication.

GENE FUNCTION

Zeng et al. (1996) noted several studies in humans suggesting that
axillary odors and secretions from both males and females are a source
of chemical signals containing physiologically active components capable
of altering the female menstrual cycle. These alterations include the
menstrual synchrony effect first documented by McClintock (1971) in an
all-female living group and later replicated by others in coeducational
facilities (Graham and McGrew, 1980; Quadagno et al., 1981). In nonhuman
mammals such as rodents, estrous synchrony has been shown to be mediated
by airborne chemical signals (McClintock, 1978). Certain axillary
components currently function as chemical signals involved in the
regulation of reproductive function via alteration of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis; chemical signals for this mode of
action are termed primer pheromones. Characterization of the source of
the odor in the human axillary region is not only of commercial interest
but is also important biologically because axillary extracts can alter
the length and timing of the female menstrual cycle. In males, the most
abundant odor component is known to be E-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid
(E-3M2H), which is liberated from nonodorous apocrine secretions by
axillary microorganisms. In the apocrine gland secretions, 3M2H is
carried on the skin surface bound to 2 proteins, apocrine secretion
odor-binding proteins 1 and 2 (ASOB1 and ASOB2) with apparent molecular
masses of 45 kD and 26 kD, respectively (summary by Zeng et al., 1996).

MAPPING

Drayna et al. (1987) assigned the gene for APOD to 3p14.2-qter by dot
blot hybridization to DNA from sorted human chromosomes and by in situ
hybridization. Cellular retinol-binding proteins (180260, 180280) are
coded by chromosome 3; interstitial RBP (180290) is coded by a gene on
chromosome 10. Warden et al. (1992) demonstrated that the ApoD gene is
located on mouse chromosome 16.

609925	TITLE *609925 DIPEPTIDASE 2; DPEP2
;;MEMBRANE-BOUND DIPEPTIDASE 2; MBD2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DPEP2 belongs to the membrane-bound dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.19) family.
These enzymes hydrolyze a variety of dipeptides, including leukotriene
D4, the beta-lactam ring of some antibiotics, and cystinyl-bis-glycine
(cys-bis-gly) formed during glutathione degradation (Habib et al.,
2003).

CLONING

Habib et al. (2003) cloned mouse Dpep2, which they called Mbd2, and
identified human MBD2 by database analysis. The deduced 578-amino acid
mouse protein contains several residues conserved among MBDs, including
6 cysteines, 3 histidines, and a glutamic acid that is important for
catalytic activity. Mouse and human MBD2 share 80% amino acid identity.
Northern blot analysis detected 2 Mbd2 RNAs in mouse heart and lung, but
only 1 in testis. Spleen, liver, and skeletal muscle expressed low Mbd2
levels, and no expression was detected in kidney and brain.
Phospholipase treatment released Mbd2 from transfected COS-7 cell
membranes, indicating that Mbd2 is anchored to the membrane through
glycosylphosphatidylinositol modification.

GENE FUNCTION

Habib et al. (2003) demonstrated that COS-7 cells transfected with mouse
Mbd2 could convert leukotriene D4 to leukotriene E4, but they could not
hydrolyze cys-bis-gly or beta-lactam. Inhibition of Mbd2 by
penicillamine indicated that it is a metallopeptidase.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the DPEP2
gene to chromosome 16 (TMAP SHGC-60762).

602666	TITLE *602666 MYOSIN XVA; MYO15A
;;MYOSIN XV; MYO15
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Wang et al. (1998) isolated a partial MYO15A cDNA from a human
chromosome 17-specific human cDNA library. The deduced 1,585-amino acid
partial protein shares 99% amino acid identity with a mouse partial
protein isolated by Probst et al. (1998). MYO15A contains an N-terminal
motor domain, 2 light-chain binding IQ motifs, and a tail region
containing a MyTH4 and a talin (186745)-like domain. The extent of
sequence divergence of the MYO15A motor domain from other reported
myosins qualified MYO15A as a new branch of the myosin superfamily.
Northern blot analysis detected MYO15A expression in human fetal and
adult brain, and RT-PCR analysis detected expression in human fetal
cochlea. RNA dot-blot analysis showed expression in ovary, testis,
kidney, and pituitary gland.

Probst et al. (1998) isolated a partial mouse Myo15a clone. Northern
blot analysis detected Myo15a in adult mouse brain and kidney.

Liang et al. (1999) characterized the complete MYO15A sequence. The
3,530-residue protein has a calculated molecular mass of 395 kD. The
corresponding mouse protein contains 3,511 residues and shares 82%
overall identity. A full-length 11.9-kb mRNA, not including the poly(A)
tail, was detected. The MYO15A protein sequence was found to be unusual
for myosins in that it contains a 1,200-residue N-terminal extension,
encoded by exon 2, that precedes the conserved motor domain. Several
alternatively spliced transcripts were identified in both species,
including 1 transcript that skipped exon 2. There was high expression in
the adult pituitary gland.

Belyantseva et al. (2005) noted that the C terminus of MYO15A contains 2
repeats each composed of a MyTH4 and a FERM domain, separated by an SH3
domain, with a PDZ ligand at the C-terminal tip.

GENE FUNCTION

Belyantseva et al. (2005) determined that the C-terminal PDZ ligand of
mouse Myo15a interacted with the third PDZ domain of whirlin (WHRN;
607928), and this interaction was required for the targeting of whirlin
to the tips of stereocilia. Reintroduction of Myo15a into hair cells of
Myo15a-deficient mice restored the recruitment of endogenous whirlin to
the tips of stereocilia. Belyantseva et al. (2005) concluded that the
interaction of MYO15A with whirlin is a key event in hair bundle
morphogenesis.

Delprat et al. (2005) showed that whirlin, like myosin XVa, is present
at the very tip of rat stereocilium in the developing and mature hair
bundles of the cochlear and vestibular system. The myosin XVa SH3-MyTH4
region bound to the short isoform of whirlin (PR-PDZ3), whereas the
C-terminal MyTH4-FERM region of myosin XVa bound to the PDZ1 and PDZ2
domains of the long whirlin isoform. Delprat et al. (2005) concluded
that a direct myosin XVa/whirlin interaction at the stereocilia tip is
likely to control the elongation of stereocilia.

Manor et al. (2011) determined that Myo15a and whirlin interacted with
Eps8 (600206) at the tips of stereocilia in mouse inner and outer
cochlear and vestibular hair cells. Knockout of Eps8, like knockout of
Myo15a and whirlin, caused shortening of stereocilia and profound
deafness. Knockdown studies showed that Eps8 was dependent upon Myo15a
for its stereocilia localization. Knockdown of whirlin reduced
expression of both Myo15a and Eps8 at stereocilia tips. Overexpression
of Eps8 with Myo15a resulted in stereocilia elongation. In transfected
COS-7 cells, Myo15a and Eps8 expression cooperatively elongated actin
protrusions. Protein pull-down experiments with truncated proteins
revealed that the second MyTh4-FERM domain of the Myo15a tail interacted
predominantly with the C terminus of Eps8. The N terminus of Eps8
interacted with whirlin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liang et al. (1999) determined that the MYO15A gene contains 66 exons
and spans about 71 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected individuals from 3 unrelated families with autosomal
recessive congenital deafness (DFNB3; 600316), Wang et al. (1998)
identified homozygous mutations in the MYO15A gene
(602666.0001-602666.0003).

In 3 consanguineous families from Pakistan and India with DFNB3, Liburd
et al. (2001) identified homozygous mutations in the MYO15A gene
(602666.0004-602666.0006). In addition, a hemizygous missense mutation
(602666.0007) was found in a patient with Smith-Magenis syndrome
(182290) due to a deletion in chromosome 17p11.2. The patient had
moderately severe hearing loss. The unaffected mother was heterozygous
for the mutation.

Nal et al. (2007) identified 16 novel MYO15A mutations that cosegregated
with DFNB3 hearing loss in 20 families from Turkey, India, and Pakistan.
Two mutations (E1105X; 602666.0008 and 3334delG; 602666.0009) were
located in the alternatively-spliced exon 2 that encodes the large
N-terminal extension of the MYO15A protein. The findings indicated that
the long isoform of MYO15A is necessary for normal auditory function.

In a large multigenerational consanguineous Brazilian pedigree with
prelingual severe to profound sensorineural deafness, negative for
mutations in the deafness-associated GJB2 (121011) and GJB6 (604418)
genes and for the A1555G mitochondrial mutation in the MTRNR1 gene
(561000.0001), Lezirovitz et al. (2008) identified unexpected genetic
heterogeneity: 15 affected individuals from 'branch 2' of the family
were homozygous for a 1-bp deletion (10573delA; 602666.0012) in the
MYO15A gene, whereas 4 affected sibs from 'branch 1' and 1 individual
from 'branch 2' were compound heterozygous for 10573delA and a 4-bp
deletion (602666.0013) in MYO15A. In 1 patient, only the 10573delA
mutation could be identified. No mutations in MYO15A were identified in
5 patients from 2 additional branches of the family.

ANIMAL MODEL

Shaker-2 (sh2) is a recessive mouse mutation on chromosome 11 that arose
in the progeny of an x-ray irradiated mouse. Affected mice lack a normal
startle response to sound and show no auditory brainstem responses to
sound pressure levels up to high levels, indicating profound deafness.
Associated vestibular defects cause head-tossing and circling behavior.
The stereociliary bundles on both the inner and outer hair cells of
1-month-old shaker-2 mice are short and dysmorphic, but are arrayed in a
nearly normal pattern. Complete 1-Mb yeast artificial chromosome (YAC)
and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contigs that spanned the
shaker-2 critical region were generated. Probst et al. (1998) used a BAC
transgene from the shaker-2 critical region to correct the vestibular
defects, deafness, and inner ear morphology of shaker-2 mice. Using this
approach, the authors identified an unconventional myosin gene,
designated Myo15. Shaker-2 mice were found to have an amino acid
substitution at a highly conserved position within the motor domain of
this myosin. Auditory hair cells of shaker-2 mice have very short
stereocilia and a long actin-containing protrusion extending from the
basal end. This histopathology suggested that Myo15 is necessary for
actin organization in the hair cells of the cochlea.

Anderson et al. (2000) described the shaker-2(J) lesion, which is a
14.7-kb deletion that removes the last 6 exons from the 3-prime terminus
of the Myo15 transcript. These exons encode a FERM (F, ezrin, radixin,
and moesin) domain that may interact with integral membrane proteins.
Despite the deletion of 6 exons, in situ hybridization revealed that
Myo15 mRNA transcripts and protein were present in the postnatal day 1
shaker-2J inner ear, suggesting that the FERM domain is critical for the
development of normal hearing and balance. Myo15 transcripts were first
detectable at embryonic day 13.5 in wildtype mice. Myo15 transcripts in
the mouse inner ear were restricted to the sensory epithelium of the
developing cristae ampularis, macula utriculi, and macula sacculi of the
vestibular system, as well as to the developing organ of Corti. Similar
to shaker-2, shaker-2J alleles result in abnormally short hair cell
stereocilia in the cochlear and vestibular systems. The authors
suggested that Myo15 may be important for both the structure and
function of these sensory epithelia.

The MYO15, MYO6 (600970), and MYO7A (276903) genes are essential for
hearing in both humans and mice. Despite widespread expression,
homozygosity for mutations in these genes only results in auditory or
ocular dysfunction. The pirouette (pi) mouse exhibits deafness and inner
ear pathology resembling that of Myo15 mutant mice. Karolyi et al.
(2003) crossed shaker-2 mice to Myo6, Myo7a, and pi mutant mouse
strains. Viable double-mutant homozygotes were obtained from each cross,
and hearing in doubly heterozygous mice was similar to singly
heterozygous mice. All critical cell types of the cochlear sensory
epithelium were present in double-mutant mice, and cochlear stereocilia
exhibited a superimposition of single-mutant phenotypes. Karolyi et al.
(2003) suggested that the function of Myo15 is distinct from that of
Myo6, Myo7a, or pi in development and/or maintenance of stereocilia.

MYO15A, ILE892PHE

In affected individuals with recessive congenital deafness (DFNB3;
600316) from a kindred in Bengkala, an Indonesian village on the north
shore of Bali, Wang et al. (1998) found homozygosity for an
ile892-to-phe (I892F) mutation in the MYO15 gene.

Friedman et al. (1995) had reported that 2% of the residents of Bengkala
had DFNB3. The remote village dated to at least the 13th century as
documented by charters inscribed in Sanskrit on metallic plates. Of the
2,185 residents, 47 had profound deafness of the type described as
DFNB3. As an adaptation to the high percentage of deaf individuals, the
citizens of Bengkala had developed a unique sign language used by most
of the hearing persons as well as the deaf villagers. Deaf couples
produced all deaf progeny. In 4- and 5-generation Bengkala kindreds, 2
of which were illustrated, there were no consanguineous marriages.

moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss (DFNB3; 600316) was

612688	TITLE *612688 RING FINGER PROTEIN 168; RNF168
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The complex repair response elicited by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)
includes recruitment of several DNA repair proteins and ubiquitination
of H2A-type histones (see 613499). RNF168 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase
critical for DSB repair (Stewart et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using RNA interference to identify proteins required for accumulation of
53BP1 (TP53BP1; 605230) at sites of DNA damage, Doil et al. (2009) and
Stewart et al. (2009) independently identified RNF168. The deduced
571-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal RING finger domain,
followed by 2 'motifs interacting with ubiquitin' (MIU) domains. Doil et
al. (2009) noted that the first MIU domain is located within a
coiled-coil region.

GENE FUNCTION

Independently, Doil et al. (2009) and Stewart et al. (2009) found that
RNF168 was required to sustain conjugated ubiquitin (191339) at DSBs.
RNF168 assembled at DSBs in an RNF8 (611685)-dependent manner and
functioned as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that acted with UBC13 (UBE2N;
603679) to catalyze formation of lys63-linked ubiquitin conjugates and
promote ubiquitination of H2A and H2AX (H2AFX; 601772). Ubiquitinated
H2A and H2AX in turn mediated accumulation of 53BP1 and BRCA1 (113705)
at DSBs to promote DSB repair and DNA damage checkpoints.

Nakada et al. (2010) reported that OTUB1 (608337), a deubiquitinating
enzyme, is an inhibitor of double-stranded break-induced chromatin
ubiquitination. Surprisingly, they found that OTUB1 suppresses
RNF168-dependent polyubiquitination independently of its catalytic
activity. OTUB1 does so by binding to and inhibiting UBC13, the cognate
E2 enzyme for RNF168. Nakada et al. (2010) suggested that this unusual
mode of regulation is unlikely to be limited to UBC13 because analysis
of OTUB1-associated proteins revealed that OTUB1 binds to E2s of the
UBE2D and UBE2E subfamilies. Finally, OTUB1 depletion mitigates the
double-stranded break repair defect associated with defective ATM
(607585) signaling, indicating that pharmacologic targeting of the
OTUB1-UBC13 interaction might enhance the DNA damage response.

Okamoto et al. (2013) addressed the molecular properties of TRF2
(602027) that are both necessary and sufficient to protect chromosome
ends in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and stated that their data
supported a 2-step mechanism for TRF2-mediated end protection. First,
the dimerization domain of TRF2 is required to inhibit ATM (607585)
activation, the key initial step involved in the activation of a DNA
damage response (DDR). Next, TRF2 independently suppresses the
propagation of DNA damage signaling downstream of ATM activation. This
novel modulation of the DDR at telomeres occurs at the level of the E3
ubiquitin ligase RNF168. Inhibition of RNF168 at telomeres involves the
deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC3 (300617) and the ubiquitin ligase UBR5
(608413), and is sufficient to suppress chromosome end-to-end fusions.
Okamoto et al. (2013) concluded that this 2-step mechanism for
TRF2-mediated end protection helped to explain the apparent paradox of
frequent localization of DDR proteins at functional telomeres without
concurrent induction of detrimental DNA repair activities.

GENE STRUCTURE

Stewart et al. (2009) determined that the RNF168 gene contains at least
6 exons.

MAPPING

Doil et al. (2009) stated that the RNF168 gene maps to chromosome 3q29.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with RIDDLE syndrome (611943), Stewart et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 truncating mutations in the
RNF168 gene (612688.0001 and 612688.0002). The authors noted that the
patient's father, who was heterozygous for 1 of the mutations, had
developed chronic B-cell leukemia, suggesting that RNF168 may also act
as a tumor suppressor gene.

RIDDLE SYNDROME
RNF168, 1-BP DUP, 397G

In a patient with RIDDLE syndrome (611943), Stewart et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the RNF168 gene: a
1-bp duplication (397dupG) and a 4-bp deletion (1323delACAA;
612688.0002). Both mutations resulted in a frameshift and premature
protein truncation. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1 of the
mutations. Immunostudies failed to detect any RNF168 protein in the
patient's cells, and expression of wildtype RNF168 restored
radioresistance. Stewart et al. (2009) concluded that lack of RNF168
resulted in the inability to repair double-stranded DNA breaks.

184753	TITLE *184753 STEROID 5-ALPHA-REDUCTASE 1; SRD5A1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Steroid 5-alpha-reductase (EC 1.3.99.5) catalyzes the conversion of
testosterone into the more potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT).
Also see SRD5A2 (607306).

CLONING

Andersson and Russell (1990) described the structure of a cDNA encoding
human steroid 5-alpha-reductase. Sequence analysis indicated that the
enzyme is a hydrophobic protein of 259 amino acids with a predicted
molecular mass of 29,462 Da. The human and rat proteins share 60%
sequence identity.

MAPPING

Using a cDNA isolated from a prostate cDNA library for analysis of
Chinese hamster/human somatic cell hybrid lines, Hsieh et al. (1991)
demonstrated that the steroid 5-alpha-reductase gene is located on
chromosome 5 and on 5pter-q13 in a regional mapping panel. By in situ
hybridization, the gene was localized to 5p15.

Hsieh et al. (1991) mapped the homologous gene (Srd5a-1) to mouse
chromosome 13 in a panel of Chinese hamster or rat/mouse somatic cell
hybrids and by study of recombinant inbred strains. A human pseudogene
was found in the Xq24-qter region; no such gene was found in the mouse.
Also see Jenkins et al. (1991).

GENE FAMILY

By bioinformatic analysis of SRD5A gene family members, Cantagrel et al.
(2010) showed that proteins with a steroid 5-alpha-reductase domain
could be separated into 3 groups. SRD5A1 and SRD5A1 belonged to 1 group,
whereas SRD5A3 (611715), which is a polyprenol reductase, and its yeast
ortholog Dfg10, constituted a second group. The third group consisted of
TECR (610057), which is an enoyl reductase, and TECRL (or SRD5A2L2). The
phylogenetic analysis supported the idea that different classes of
lipids can be substrates for these enzymes and suggested that the
substrate of the enzyme encoded by the common ancestral gene was
potentially not a steroid.

GENE FUNCTION

Harris et al. (1992) concluded that SRD5A1 is a minor component of the
reductase activity in prostate although the gene was originally cloned
from prostate. On the other hand, SRD5A1 appears to be the predominant
isozyme of steroid 5-alpha-reductase in the scalp and elsewhere in the
skin. The possibility of scalp-selective inhibitors being useful in the
treatment of male pattern baldness, acne, and hirsutism, all 'disorders'
that appear to be dihydrotestosterone dependent, was raised.

Investigating by immunoblotting the tissue-specific and developmental
expression patterns of the 5-alpha-reductase isozymes, Thigpen et al.
(1993) showed that the type 1 isozyme is not detectable in the fetus, is
transiently expressed in newborn skin and scalp, and is permanently
expressed in skin from the time of puberty. There was no qualitative
difference in 5-alpha-reductase type 1 expression between adult balding
versus nonbalding scalp. The type 2 isozyme was transiently expressed in
skin and scalp of newborns. Type 2 is the predominant isozyme detectable
in fetal genital skin, in male accessory sex organs, and in the
prostate, including benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate
adenocarcinoma tissues. These results were considered consistent with
5-alpha-reductase type 1 being responsible for the virilization in type
2-deficient subjects (see 264600) during puberty and suggested that the
type 2 isozyme may be an initiating factor in the development of male
pattern baldness.

From a population survey of 828 healthy families comprising 3,000
individuals, Ellis et al. (1998) identified 58 young bald men (aged 18
to 30 years) and 114 older nonbald men (aged 50 to 70 years) for a
case-control comparison. No significant differences were found between
cases and controls in allele, genotype, or haplotype frequencies for
RFLPs related to either the SRD5A1 or the SRD5A2 gene. These findings
suggested that the genes encoding these 5-alpha-reductase isoenzymes are
not associated with male pattern baldness. Ellis et al. (1998) failed to
find a clear inheritance pattern of male pattern baldness.

Jakimiuk et al. (1999) sought to determine if there is increased SRD5A
activity or mRNA expression in polycystic ovaries. SRD5A1 and SRD5A2
mRNAs were measured in thecal (TC) and granulosa (GC) cells from
individual follicles of 18 women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS;
184700) and 26 regularly cycling control women. SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 mRNA
expression was higher in GC than in TC, and SRD5A2 mRNA levels were
approximately 3-fold higher than SRD5A1 mRNA. SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 mRNA
expression was similar in GC from PCOS and control women, but SRD5A mRNA
was decreased in TC from PCOS follicles. The total SRD5A activity was
approximately 4-fold higher in PCOS follicles than in control follicles.
These data demonstrated elevated SRD5A activity in polycystic ovaries
and supported the hypothesis that 5-alpha-reduced androgens may play a
role in the pathogenesis of PCOS.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Jenkins et al. (1992) used RFLPs of the SRD5A1 gene to exclude the gene
as the site of the mutation in classic 5-alpha-reductase deficiency
(pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias; 264600). They further showed
that in contrast to the major steroid 5-alpha-reductase in the prostate
and cultured skin fibroblasts, which was designated SRD5A2, the
cDNA-encoded enzyme, representing SRD5A1, exhibited a neutral to basic
pH optimum and was much less sensitive to inhibition by the 4-aza
steroid finasteride.

Goodarzi et al. (2006) tested the hypothesis that haplotypes in the
SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 genes are risk factors for PCOS and the severity of
hirsutism in affected women. A total of 287 white women with PCOS and
187 controls participated. Haplotypes within both genes were associated
with PCOS risk. Haplotypes in SRD5A1 but not SRD5A2 were also associated
with the degree of hirsutism in affected women. That only SRD5A1
haplotypes were associated with hirsutism suggested to Goodarzi et al.
(2006) that only this isoform is important in the hair follicle.

124070	TITLE *124070 CYTOCHROME P450, SUBFAMILY IIF, POLYPEPTIDE 1; CYP2F1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

CYP2F1 encodes a P450 enzyme capable of metabolizing several
monooxygenase substrates, with the highest activity toward
ethoxycoumarin. Nhamburo et al. (1990) cloned a cDNA coding for a P450,
designated CYP2F1, from a human lung lambda-gt11 library. The
cDNA-encoded protein had 491 amino acids.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, Mitchell et al. (1989) demonstrated
that, like CYP2A (see 122720) and CYP2B (123930), CYP2F1 is located on
human chromosome 19 and mouse chromosome 7.

Based on Southern blotting analysis with multiple restriction enzymes,
Nhamburo et al. (1990) concluded that the CYP2F1 gene is flanked by a
second highly similar gene.

In more than 50 meioses, Bale et al. (1991) found no recombinants
between CYP2F1 and CYP2B and 1 recombinant between CYP2F1 and CYP2A.
Pulsed field gel electrophoresis showed that the 3 loci lie within a
240-kb region. Multipoint analysis of the haplotyped CYP cluster with 4
other chromosome 19 loci yielded the order
D19S7--D19S9--APOC2--D19S8--CYP.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Trask et al. (1993) assigned the
CYP2F gene to 19q13.2.

609410	TITLE *609410 SYNAPTOJANIN 2; SYNJ2
;;KIAA0348
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Synaptojanin-2 is a ubiquitously expressed inositol polyphosphate
5-phosphatase (Malecz et al., 2000).

CLONING

By sequencing clones isolated from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) cloned SYNJ2, which they designated
KIAA0348. The deduced protein shares 42.4% amino acid identity with rat
synaptojanin (SYNJ1; 604297) over 932 amino acids. RT-PCR detected low
SYNJ2 expression in kidney, pancreas, thymus, prostate, and ovary.

Seet et al. (1998) cloned several mouse Synj2 isoforms. The longest
deduced protein, designated Synj2-alpha, contains 1,216 amino acids and
has a calculated molecular mass of 140 kD. Synj2 contains an N-terminal
Sac1 (SACM1L; 606869) homology domain, a central inositol
5-prime-phosphatase domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich region. The
nucleotide sequence of Synj2-alpha shares 86% identity with the human
SYNJ2 clone isolated by Nagase et al. (1997). Synj2 variants arise from
the use of 2 possible initiation sites and at least 6 different exons
encoding C-terminal domains. Initiation from the alternative start sites
results in isoforms that vary in the presence of 84 amino acids in the
N-terminal part of the Sac1 homology domain. Database analysis indicated
the presence of a third putative initiation site in human SYNJ2,
resulting in a protein that lacks most of the Sac1 homology domain. Seet
et al. (1998) suggested that variation in the C-terminal proline-rich
region, which includes PxxP motifs, may alter interactions between SYNJ2
and SH3 domain-containing proteins.

Nemoto et al. (2001) cloned 2 splice variants of rat Synj2. They
designated these variants Synj2b1 and Synj2b2 and referred to the
original rat Synj2 cloned by Nemoto et al. (1997) as Synj2a. Synj2a
contains a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain, whereas Synj2b1 and Synj2b2
contain multiple potential SH3 domain-binding regions in their C
termini. Synj2b2 has a 46-amino acid C-terminal sequence absent in
Synj2b1. By RT-PCR of human lung, peripheral leukocytes, placenta, and
brain using primers based on the KIAA0348 sequence isolated by Nagase et
al. (1997), Nemoto et al. (2001) obtained a human SYNJ2 cDNA encoding a
1,443-amino acid protein. Nemoto et al. (2001) suggested that this human
isoform is homologous to rat Synj2b2 and is incomplete at its 5-prime
end, lacking the region that encodes the most N-terminal 50 amino acids.
By immunofluorescence microscopy, Nemoto et al. (2001) localized the
Synj2b isoforms to nerve terminals in rat brain and at spermatid
manchette in rat testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Nemoto and DeCamilli (1999) found that the PDZ domain of rat Omp25
(SYNJ2BP; 609411) interacted with a C-terminal domain of Synj2a.
Overexpression of Omp25 resulted in perinuclear clustering of
mitochondria in transfected cells, and this effect was mimicked by
enforced expression of Synj2a on the mitochondrial outer membrane but
not by a Synj2a mutant lacking the inositol 5-phosphatase domain. Nemoto
and DeCamilli (1999) concluded that OMP25 mediates recruitment of SYNJ2A
to mitochondria.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and in vitro binding assays, Malecz et al.
(2000) showed that a 56-amino acid domain in the C terminus of human
SYNJ2 interacted with RAC1 (602048). Expression of constitutively active
RAC1 caused the translocation of SYNJ2 from the cytoplasm to the plasma
membrane. Both activated RAC1 and a membrane-targeted version of SYNJ2
inhibited endocytosis of EGF receptor (EGFR; 131550) and transferrin
receptor (TFRC; 190010), a process that depends on
polyphosphoinositides.

Nemoto et al. (2001) found that both amphiphysin (AMPH; 600418) and
endophilin (see SH3GL2; 604465) bound rat Synj2b2, but only amphiphysin
bound Synj2b1. Nemoto et al. (2001) identified an endophilin-binding
site within Synj2b2 that could affinity purify endophilin from rat
brain. The SAC1 domain of Synj2 showed phosphoinositide phosphatase
activity similar to the Sac1 domain of Synj1.

By Northern and Western blot analyses, Spaenij-Dekking et al. (2003)
showed that SYNJ2 expression was increased in hairy cell leukemia (HCL)
samples compared with other B cells. They also found that an epitope of
SYNJ2 was an autoantigen for HCL-specific T cells.

Chuang et al. (2004) found that small interfering RNA-mediated depletion
of RAC1 or SYNJ2 in 2 human glioblastoma cell lines inhibited migration
of the cells through 3-dimensional gel and rat brain slices, and it
inhibited cell migration on glioma-derived extracellular matrix.
Depletion of RAC1 or SYNJ2 inhibited formation of lamellipodia and
invadopodia, specialized membrane structures involved in extracellular
matrix degradation. Chuang et al. (2004) concluded that SYNJ2 and RAC1
contribute to cell invasion and migration by regulating the formation of
invadopodia and lamellipodia.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the SYNJ2 gene
to chromosome 6. By FISH, Seet et al. (1998) mapped the mouse Synj2 gene
to chromosome 17A2-A3.1.

;;CHEMOKINE-LIKE FACTOR SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 6; CKLFSF6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the chemokine-like factor superfamily, including CKLFSF6,
share similarity with both the chemokine (see 604852) and the
transmembrane 4 (see 300191) superfamilies of signaling molecules.

CLONING

By screening databases for sequences that share homology with
chemokine-like factor (CKLF), followed by RT-PCR of a prostate cDNA
library, Han et al. (2003) cloned CKLFSF6. The deduced 183-amino acid
CKLFSF6 protein has 4 transmembrane segments. It shares about 31%
sequence identity with CKLFSF4 (607887). Northern blot analysis detected
a transcript of 3.88 kb expressed in leukocytes, placenta, and testis. A
smaller transcript was also detected in leukocytes. Han et al. (2003)
cloned mouse Cklfsf6, which shares about 88.5% sequence similarity with
CKLFSF6.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Han et al. (2003) mapped the CKLFSF6 gene
to chromosome 3, where it resides within a gene cluster with the CKLFSF7
(607890) and CKLFSF8 (607891) genes. They mapped the mouse Cklfsf6 gene
to chromosome 9, where it is located within a similar gene cluster.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By large-scale sequence analysis of a fetal brain cDNA library, Dai et
al. (2003) cloned ZNF461. The deduced 563-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 66 kD. ZNF461 contains a double KRAB domain
at the N terminus and 11 C2H2-type zinc finger motifs at the C terminus,
suggesting a role in DNA binding. It shares 68% amino acid identity with
rat Giot1. RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression, with highest levels in
liver, kidney, pancreas, thymus, and small intestine.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dai et al. (2003) determined that the ZNF461 gene contains 6 exons and
spans about 26 kb.

608159	TITLE *608159 PROTEASE, SERINE, 21; PRSS21
;;EOSINOPHIL SERINE PROTEASE 1; ESP1;;
TESTISIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PRSS21 is a membrane-type serine protease that shows highest expression
in premeiotic testicular germ cells.

CLONING

By PCR of an eosinophil cDNA library using degenerate primers based on
the active site of serine proteases, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime
RACE, Inoue et al. (1998) cloned PRSS21, which they called ESP1. The
deduced 314-amino acid ESP1 precursor protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 33.1 kD, and the 273-amino acid active form has a calculated
molecular mass of 30.6 kD. ESP1 contains an N-terminal signal peptide, a
propeptide, an active site catalytic triad of conserved his, asp, and
ser residues, and a hydrophobic C terminus, which suggests that ESP1 is
a membrane-type serine protease. ESP1 shares about 41% amino acid
identity with prostasin (PRSS8; 600823). Northern blot analysis detected
a 1.2- to 1.4-kb transcript in HeLa cells. RT-PCR detected high
expression of ESP1 in testis and prostate, moderate expression in lung,
pancreas, and spleen, and low expression in thymus, colon, and
peripheral blood leukocytes. No expression was detected in kidney and
skeletal muscle. Western blot analysis of transfected human embryonic
kidney cells showed that ESP1 has an apparent molecular mass of 35 kD.

Using PCR, Hooper et al. (1999) cloned PRSS21, which they designated
testisin, from a HeLa cell cDNA library. They identified 3 putative
N-glycosylation sites and 10 conserved cysteine residues in the PRSS21
protein. By analogy to other serine proteases, Hooper et al. (1999)
concluded that 8 of these cysteines likely form disulfide bridges within
the catalytic region, while the remaining 2 probably link the propeptide
and catalytic regions. PRSS21 shares 26 to 38% amino acid identity with
hepsin (142440), acrosin (102480), chymotrypsin (see 118890), and PSA
(176820). Hooper et al. (1999) identified a PRSS21 splice variant that
encodes a 312-amino acid precursor lacking 2 residues near the catalytic
histidine. Northern blot analysis of several human tissues detected a
1.4-kb transcript only in testis. RNA dot blot analysis detected
abundant expression in testis and weak expression in salivary gland,
bone marrow, lung, and trachea. Immunostaining of normal testicular
tissue showed PRSS21 expression in the cytoplasm and on the plasma
membrane of premeiotic germ cells. No staining was detected in 8 germ
cell-derived testicular tumors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Inoue et al. (1999) and Hooper et al. (2000) determined that the PRSS21
gene contains 6 exons and spans 4.5 to 4.6 kb. Using a reporter plasmid,
Inoue et al. (1999) identified a GC-rich 5-prime flanking region
containing an AP1 (see 165160)/SP1 (189906)-binding site as the minimum
promoter for expression in HeLa cells. Hooper et al. (2000) determined
that the promoter region lacks a TATA consensus sequence but contains a
CCAAT box and a CpG island, as well as binding sites for several
testis-specific elements. They noted that the PRSS21 gene has a
structure similar to that of the PRSS8 gene, which maps to chromosome
16p11.2, near PRSS21, suggesting that the 2 genes may have evolved
through gene duplication.

MAPPING

By FISH, Hooper et al. (1999) mapped the PRSS21 gene to chromosome
16p13.3, a region associated with allelic imbalance and loss of
heterozygosity in sporadic testicular tumors. Inoue et al. (1999) mapped
the PRSS21 gene to chromosome 16p13.3 by radiation hybrid analysis and
FISH.

609263	TITLE *609263 SEH1-LIKE PROTEIN; SEH1L
;;SEH1, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; SEH1;;
SEC13-LIKE PROTEIN; SEC13L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Bidirectional transport of macromolecules between the cytoplasm and
nucleus occurs through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) embedded in the
nuclear envelope. NPCs are composed of subcomplexes, and SEH1L is part
of one such subcomplex, Nup107-160 (Loiodice et al., 2004).

CLONING

By proteomic analysis and mass spectrometry, Cronshaw et al. (2002)
identified 94 proteins associated with NPCs purified from rat liver
nuclei. Seh1l, which they referred to as Sec13l and Seh1, was abundant,
with 16 to 32 copies per NPC. By database analysis, Cronshaw et al.
(2002) identified the deduced amino acid sequence of human SEH1L, which
contains WD repeats and has a calculated molecular mass of 40 kD. SEH1L
shares 34% amino acid identity with yeast Seh1 and 30% identity with
yeast Sec13 (600152). Transient transfection of fluorescence-tagged
SEH1L in HeLa cells resulted in punctate rim localization typical of
nucleoporins.

GENE FUNCTION

Loiodice et al. (2004) found that SEH1L was loosely associated with the
Nup107-160 complex biochemically. SEH1L depletion by RNA interference
led to phenotypes similar to knockdown of other constituents of this
complex, including delocalization of some nucleoporins from the nuclear
envelope. All constituents of the Nup107-160 complex, including SEH1L,
were targeted to kinetochores from prophase to anaphase during mitosis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Nup85 (170285) and Seh1 constitute a module
in the heptameric Nup84 (NUP107) complex. Brohawn et al. (2008)
determined the structure of a complex of S. cerevisiae Nup85 residues 1
to 564 (of 744) and intact Seh1 at 3.5-angstrom resolution. Structural,
biochemical, and genetic analyses positioned the Nup84 complex in 2
peripheral nuclear pore complex rings. Brohawn et al. (2008) established
a conserved tripartite element, the ancestral coatomer element ACE1,
that reoccurs in several nucleoporins and vesicle coat proteins,
providing structural evidence of coevolution from a common ancestor.
They identified interactions that define the organization of the Nup84
complex on the basis of comparison with vesicle coats and confirmed the
sites by mutagenesis. Brohawn et al. (2008) proposed that the nuclear
pore complex scaffold, like vesicle coats, is composed of polygons with
vertices and edges forming a membrane-proximal lattice that provides
docking sites for additional nucleoporins.

MAPPING

Hartz (2005) mapped the SEH1L gene to chromosome 18p11.21 based on an
alignment of the SEH1L sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF136976) with the
genomic sequence.

602509	TITLE *602509 GOLGI AUTOANTIGEN, GOLGIN SUBFAMILY A, 4; GOLGA4
;;TRANS-GOLGI p230;;
GOLGIN 245
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To characterize the Golgi complex, Kooy et al. (1992) used serum from a
Sjogren syndrome (270150) patient with a high titer of anti-Golgi
autoantibodies. The serum immunoprecipitated a 230-kD protein that was
specifically localized to the cytosolic surface of what was probably the
trans-face of the Golgi stack. The 230-kD Golgi protein appeared to be a
peripheral membrane component. The authors detected the 230-kD antigen
in several cell types and species. By screening a HeLa cell cDNA
expression library with the anti-Golgi autoantibodies, Erlich et al.
(1996) identified a p230 cDNA. The 7.7-kb p230 mRNA encodes a
2,230-amino acid protein with a predicted coiled-coil structure,
stabilized by heptad repeats. The p230 protein also contains a granin
motif (see 113705). By SDS-PAGE, p230 from HeLa cells migrated as a
230-kD protein.

Independently, Fritzler et al. (1995) cloned a partial GOLGA4 cDNA,
using serum from a Sjogren syndrome patient. Based on its predicted
molecular mass, they designated the GOLGA4 protein golgin-245.

GENE FUNCTION

Using live-cell imaging, Lieu et al. (2008) showed that tubules and
carriers expressing p230 selectively mediated TNF (191160) transport
from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in HeLa cells. Lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) activation of macrophages caused a dramatic increase in
p230-labeled tubules and carriers emerging from the TGN. Depletion of
p230 in macrophages reduced cell surface delivery of TNF more than
10-fold compared with control cells. Mice with RNA interference-mediated
silencing of p230 also had dramatically reduced surface expression of
Tnf. Lieu et al. (2008) concluded that p230 is a key regulator of TNF
secretion and that LPS activation of macrophages increases Golgi
carriers for export.

GENE STRUCTURE

Daigo et al. (1999) determined that the GOLGA4 gene contains at least 11
exons.

MAPPING

By analysis of a cloned segment from 3p22-p21.3, Daigo et al. (1999)
determined that the GOLGA4 gene is located in this region.
