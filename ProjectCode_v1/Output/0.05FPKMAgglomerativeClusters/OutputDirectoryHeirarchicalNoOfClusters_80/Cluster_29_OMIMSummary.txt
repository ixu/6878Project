607986	TITLE *607986 S100 CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN A14; S100A14
;;BCMP84
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

S100A14 is a member of a subfamily of proteins related by Ca(2+)-binding
motifs to the EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding protein superfamily.

CLONING

By analyzing a human lung cancer cell line subtractive cDNA library,
Pietas et al. (2002) identified and characterized S100A14, which encodes
a deduced 104-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of
11,662 Da. It contains 2 EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding domains, a
myristoylation motif, a glycosylation site, and several potential
protein kinase phosphorylation sites. Pietas et al. (2002) also cloned
the mouse homolog. S100A14 shares 38% amino acid sequence identity with
human S100A13 (601989) and 97% similarity with mouse S100a14. Northern
blot analysis detected expression of an approximately 1.1-kb transcript
at highest levels in colon and at moderate levels in thymus, kidney,
liver, small intestine, and lung. Low expression of an approximately
1.35-kb transcript was detected in heart and no expression was seen in
brain, skeletal muscle, spleen, placenta, and peripheral blood
leukocytes. S100A14 was found to be overexpressed in ovary, breast, and
uterus tumors and underexpressed in kidney, rectum, and colon tumors.
Transfection experiments indicated localization to the cytoplasm,
particularly in the perinuclear region.

Using a proteomics approach to identify genes upregulated in breast
cancer, followed by database analysis and PCR of a breast carcinoma cell
line, Adam et al. (2003) cloned S100A14, which they called BCMP84.
BCMP84 expression in normal tissue was restricted to stratified squamous
epithelium of skin, cervix, and tonsil. Weak staining was seen in normal
breast ductal tissue, but strong immunoreactivity was detected in 10 of
58 (17%) breast cancer tissues. BCMP84 was expressed in the plasma
membrane of transiently transfected breast carcinoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Adam et al. (2003) found that BCMP84
interacted with nucleobindin (NUCB1; 601323).

GENE STRUCTURE

Pietas et al. (2002) determined that the S100A14 gene contains 4 exons.
Exon 1 is untranslated.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Pietas et al. (2002) mapped the
S100A14 gene to chromosome 1q21 in a cluster with at least 15 other S100
genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Chen et al. (2009) identified 4 SNPs in the S100A14 gene that were in
linkage disequilibrium among Han Chinese individuals. One SNP, 461G-A
(dbSNP rs11548103) in the 5-prime untranslated region, was shown to
diminish a binding site for the transcription factor P53 (TP53; 191170),
and was associated with decreased expression of S100A14 in vitro and in
vivo. A study of S100A14 RNA levels in surgically removed normal
esophageal tissues showed that individuals with the 461GG genotype had
significantly higher S100A14 RNA levels compared to those with at least
one 461A allele. A case-control study of 1,021 Han Chinese patients with
squamous cell esophageal carcinoma (133239) and 1,253 control subjects
found a significant association between the 461A allele and increased
susceptibility to esophageal cancer among smokers (odds ratio of 2.01
and 2.10 for the 461GA or 461AA genotypes, respectively, compared to the
461GG genotype). Chen et al. (2009) suggested that S100A14 may function
as a cancer suppressor in the P53 pathway and play a role in esophageal
carcinogenesis.

610369	TITLE *610369 HEAT-SHOCK 70-KD PROTEIN 14; HSPA14
;;HSP70-LIKE 1; HSP70L1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing a human dendritic cell cDNA library, Wan et al. (2004)
obtained a full-length cDNA encoding HSPA14, which they called HSP70L1.
The deduced 509-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
54.8 kD. It has an N-terminal ATPase domain and 2 potential
N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.1-kb
transcript in all tissues examined, with highest levels in testis,
spleen, and thymus. RT-PCR detected HSP70L1 expression in various cell
lines, with highest levels in immune cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Wan et al. (2004) transfected HeLa cells with HSP70L1 and found that
HSP70L1 expression was upregulated by heat stress, TNF-alpha (191160),
and phorbol esters. HSP70L1 interacted with human dendritic cells (DCs),
resulting in DC maturation and activation. Although HSP70L1 shared
common cell surface receptors with HSP70 (HSPA1A; 140550), including
TLR2 (603028) and TLR4 (603030), there were functional differences
between the 2 proteins. HSP70L1 and HSP70 stimulated DC secretion of the
proinflammatory cytokines IL1B (147720) and TNF-alpha at comparable
levels, but HSP70L1 was a more potent stimulator of IL12p70 (see
161560). HSP70L1 induced secretion of the chemokines MIP1A (CCL3;
182283), MIP1B (CCL4; 182284), and RANTES (CCL5; 187011) and expression
of the chemokine receptors CCR7 (600242) and CXCR4 (162643) more
potently than HSP70. In addition, HSP70L1, but not HSP70, could induce
IP10 (CXCL10; 147310) secretion.

Otto et al. (2005) found that MPP11 and HSP70L1 formed a complex in HeLa
cells, rat liver, and rabbit reticulate lysate. The 2 proteins coeluted
on cation and anion exchange columns, and sucrose density gradients
showed that they comigrated with polysomes and ribosomes. The 200-kD
dimeric ribosome-associated complex (RAC) formed by MPP11 and HSP70L1
was sensitive to salt treatment and could rescue growth defects in yeast
strains lacking functional RAC.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wan et al. (2004) mapped the HSPA14 gene
to chromosome 10p12.33.

615262	TITLE *615262 METHYLTRANSFERASE-LIKE 23; METTL23
;;CHROMOSOME 17 OPEN READING FRAME 95; C17ORF95
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from a donor,
generally S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), to acceptor molecules,
including proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids, and small metabolites. METTL23
belongs to a family of protein lysine methyltransferases that methylate
nonhistone proteins (Cloutier et al., 2013).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to METTL22 (615261),
Cloutier et al. (2013) identified METTL23. The deduced protein is made
up predominantly of a Rossmann fold of alternating beta strands and
alpha helices, with a conserved AdoMet-binding site near the N terminus.
Epitope-tagged METTL23 was predominantly expressed in cytoplasmic
membrane-like structures in transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By affinity purification, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry, Cloutier et
al. (2013) found that METTL23 expressed in HEK293 cells interacted with
HSPA5 (138120), tubulin (see 602529), and UGGT1 (605897). UGGT2 (605898)
and HSP90B1 (191175) were also detected in the immunoprecipitate.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the METTL23 gene to chromosome 17q25.1 based on an
alignment of the METTL23 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC033998) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

610560	TITLE *610560 PROTEASE, SERINE, 36; PRSS36
;;POLYSERASE 2;;
POLYSERINE PROTEASE 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching human genomic databases with TMPRSS9 (610477) as query,
followed by PCR of liver RNA, Cal et al. (2005) cloned PRSS36, which
they called polyserase-2. The deduced 855-amino acid protein has a
predicted molecular mass of 93 kD and contains 9 potential
N-glycosylation sites. PRSS36 contains a signal peptide, followed by a
propeptide domain, an active serine protease domain with the catalytic
his, asp, and ser residues, and 2 serine protease domains predicted to
be catalytically inactive. The first serine protease domain shares amino
acid identity of 40 to 42% with gamma-1 tryptase (TPSG1; 609341),
pancreasin (608018), matriptase (ST14; 606797), matriptase-2 (TMPRSS6;
609862), and polyserase-1 (TMPRSS9). Northern blot analysis detected a
5-kb transcript in fetal kidney and adult skeletal muscle, liver,
placenta, and heart. A 2.2-kb transcript was detected in placenta,
prostate, and colon and lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, and may be
produced by alternative splicing. Immunolocalization studies and Western
blot analysis indicated that PRSS36 is secreted as a glycosylated
protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Cal et al. (2005) showed that purified recombinant PRSS36 constructs
lacking the prodomain hydrolyzed a variety of synthetic serine protease
substrates and that serine protease inhibitors inhibited these
activities. Activity of the first serine protease domain was higher than
that of the entire PRSS36 polyprotein.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Cal et al. (2005) mapped the PRSS36 gene
to chromosome 16p11.2.

606692	TITLE *606692 TNF RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED FACTOR 7; TRAF7
;;RING FINGER AND WD REPEAT DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; RFWD1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF; see 191160) receptor-associated factors,
such as TRAF7, are signal transducers for members of the TNF receptor
superfamily (see 191190). TRAFs are composed of an N-terminal
cysteine/histidine-rich region containing zinc RING and/or zinc finger
motifs; a coiled-coil (leucine zipper) motif; and a homologous region
that defines the TRAF family, the TRAF domain, which is involved in
self-association and receptor binding.

CLONING

Using an integrated approach comprising tandem affinity purification,
liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, network analysis, and directed
functional perturbation studies with RNA interference (RNAi) to map the
TNF/NFKB (see 164011) pathway, Bouwmeester et al. (2004) identified
RFWD1, which they termed TRAF7, as an interactor with MEKK3 (MAP3K3;
602539). The predicted 670-amino acid protein has an N-terminal RING
finger domain, followed by a noncanonical TRAF domain, a coiled-coil
(CC) domain, and 7 C-terminal WD40 repeats.

GENE FUNCTION

By mutation and coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Bouwmeester et al.
(2004) determined that the WD40 repeats of TRAF7 bind MEKK3, whereas
homodimerization of TRAF7 occurs through the central TRAF and CC
domains. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated TRAF7 localization in a
vesicular pattern in the cytosol in the presence or absence of MEKK3.
SDS-PAGE analysis suggested that MEKK3 phosphorylates sites in the
N-terminal region of TRAF7 and induces ubiquitination. In the presence
of E1 (UBE1; 314370) and E2 (see UBE2E2; 602163) activating and
conjugating enzymes, a TRAF7 fragment containing the RING domain was
ubiquitinated, indicating that TRAF7 may have E3 ubiquitin ligase (see
UBE3A; 601623) activity. Luciferase reporter and RNAi analysis
established that coexpression of wildtype TRAF7 and MEKK3 resulted in a
synergistic activation of NFKB and AP1 (165160). Bouwmeester et al.
(2004) proposed that TRAF7, in conjunction with MEKK3, might act like
TAK1 (MAP3K7; 602614) and TRAF6 (602355) in relaying signals, impinging
on the activation of JNK (601158) and p38 MAP kinases (see MAPK14;
600289), most likely by means of intermediate effectors.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RFWD1
gene to chromosome 16 (TMAP SHGC-601344).

180989	TITLE *180989 PROLINE-RICH PROTEIN, BstNI SUBFAMILY, 1; PRB1

SALIVARY PROTEIN Pe, INCLUDED;;
PAROTID MIDDLE BAND PROTEIN, INCLUDED; Pm, INCLUDED;;
PmF, INCLUDED;;
PmS, INCLUDED;;
CON2, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION Azen and Maeda (1988) reviewed the proline-rich proteins (PRP) of
saliva, which are encoded by 6 closely linked loci on chromosome 12p.
The proteins fall into acidic and basic groups. The 2 genes that encode
acidic proteins are PRH1 (168730) and PRH2 (168790), and these genes
contain repeated sequences that have a cleavage site for the restriction
enzyme HaeIII. The PRH1 locus codes for the Pa, Db, and PIF proteins.
The PRH2 locus codes for the Pr protein. The 4 genes that encode basic
proline-rich proteins are PRB1, PRB2 (168810), PRB3 (168840), and PRB4
(180990), and these genes contain repeated sequences that have a
cleavage site for the restriction enzyme BstNI. The PRB1 locus encodes
the PmF, PmS, Pe, and Con2 proteins. The PRB2 locus encodes the Ps and
Con1 proteins. The PRB3 locus encodes the G1 protein. The PRB4 locus
encodes the Po protein.

In parotid saliva of a Japanese population, Ikemoto et al. (1977) found
2 phenotypes by electrophoresis in acid-urea starch gels. The protein
showing polymorphism was located in the zone between Pa and the protein
labeled Pb (for protein basic) and thus was termed the parotid middle
band protein (Pm). Inheritance was autosomal dominant. The frequency of
the Pm(+) allele was about 0.38 in Japanese.

Azen and Denniston (1980) showed linkage of Pm and Ps to the Pa-Pr-Db-G1
cluster. On the basis of weak linkage disequilibrium, Ps may be closer
to G1 and Db than to Pa or Pr. Azen and Denniston (1980) provided
evidence for close linkage to 5 other parotid salivary protein loci.

Yu et al. (1980) presented evidence for linkage between Pa and Pr and
between Pr and Db. No significant sex heterogeneity in recombination was
found. Significant sex heterogeneity of recombination between Pa and Db
was found, but the lod score for males did not reach the level usually
accepted as proof of linkage. Population studies suggested linkage
disequilibrium among the three loci. Kauffman et al. (1982) found a
single amino acid difference between PmF and PmS proteins when a portion
of their primary structure was compared. From somatic cell genetic
studies using a human genomic probe, Goodman et al. (1984) concluded
that the cluster of genes encoding proline-rich proteins is located on
chromosome 12 and possibly on 12p since it could be excluded from the
12cen-q24 segment. The human SPC (salivary protein complex) may extend
over a map length of about 15 cM; in comparison, the major
histocompatibility complex has a map length of about 1.8 cM. Against the
proposed genetic length of 15 cM is the conclusion of Maeda (1986) that
the 6 genes of the complex are contained in a 500-kb segment of DNA.
(One cM is approximately 1,000 kb.) (Pm consists of 2 proteins, a fast
and a slow electrophoretic form, called PmF and PmS, respectively.)

Azen and Yu (1984) defined another polymorphism in the proteins of
parotid saliva. Called Pe, it was typed after protein staining in
alkaline polyacrylamide slab gels. The Pe+ allele had a frequency of
about 0.76 in both whites and blacks. From randomly collected samples,
the Pe+ protein was most strongly associated with the Con1 and Ps
proteins, less strongly associated with Pr and Pa proteins, and not
significantly associated with PmF, PmS, PIF, Db, Con2, or G1 proteins.
If it is assumed that the strength of these associations is related in
part to map distance, then these data roughly fit the preferred linear
order of PRP genes as previously determined by family linkage studies:
Ps-Pa-Pr-Pm-G1-Db. Pe was linked to Pa with maximum lod score of 2.69 at
theta = 0.0.

In a full review of salivary proteins, Azen and Maeda (1988) stated that
the 6 genes encoding proline-rich proteins are in a 700-kb interval in
the following order: PRB2--(60 kb)--PRB1--(70 kb)--PRB4--(190
kb)--PRH2--(160 kb)--PRB3--(190 kb)--PRH1.

Kim et al. (1993) presented the nucleotide sequences of 4 members of the
6-member human salivary proline-rich protein family: PRB1 and PRB2,
which encode basic PRPs, and PRB3 and PRB4, which encode glycosylated
PRPs. Each gene is approximately 4 kb long and contains 4 exons, the
third of which is entirely composed of 63-bp tandem repeats and encodes
the proline-rich portion of the protein products. Exon 3 contains
different numbers of tandem repeats in the different PRB genes.
Variation in the numbers of these repeats is also responsible for length
variations in different alleles of the PRB genes.

Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the 6 PRP genes by Kim et al.
(1993) suggested that they probably evolved from a single ancestral gene
by 4 sequential gene duplications, leading to 6 genes that fall into 3
subsets, each consisting of 2 genes. During this evolutionary process,
multiple rearrangements in gene conversion events occurred mainly in the
region between the 3-prime end of IVS2 and the 3-prime end of exon 3.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Merberg et al. (1993) first detected megakaryocyte-stimulating factor
(MSF) in the urine of patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation
during a period of acute thrombocytopenia. Subsequent cloning studies
demonstrated that this 20- to 25-kD urinary metabolite of MSF was an
N-terminal cysteine-rich polypeptide component derived from a larger,
highly glycosylated precursor protein of approximately 400 kD. The
smaller urinary metabolite was shown to stimulate growth in both pure
and mixed megakaryocyte colonies from bone marrow fibrin cultures. MSF
precursor is a multifunctional domain protein with polypeptide sequence
homologies to both serum adhesive glycoproteins and secretory mucins
(see 158370). Articular cartilage MSF precursor contains large (76 to 78
repeats) and small (6 to 8 repeats) mucin-like O-ringed
oligosaccharide-rich repeat domains flanked by cysteine-rich N- and
C-terminal domains that are homologous to the somatomedin B and
hemopexin domains of vitronectin (193190), respectively.

Schumacher et al.(1994) described superficial zone protein (SZP), an
approximately 345-kD proteoglycan specifically synthesized by
chondrocytes located at the surface of bovine articular cartilage, and
also by some synovial lining cells. They demonstrated that SZP is
secreted by superficial zone chondrocytes and not by chondrocytes from
other zones of articular cartilage. SZP contains both chondroitin
sulfate and keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. SZP is extensively
degraded by papain, trypsin (276000), and pronase, but limited pepsin
(see 169700) treatment decreases its molecular mass only to 315 kD. SZP
is predominantly found in the media of explant and cell cultures.

Flannery et al. (1999) used cDNA sequencing and homology analysis to
elucidate the complete amino acid composition for the superficial zone
protein from human and bovine cartilage. They established that human
cartilage SZP is homologous with the proteoglycan first described as the
precursor protein of a megakaryocyte-stimulating factor by Merberg et
al. (1993). The cDNA encodes a protein of 1,404 amino acids with a
somatomedin B homology domain, heparin-binding domains, multiple
mucin-like repeats, a hemopexin domain, and an aggregation domain. There
are 3 consensus sequences for N-glycosylation and 1 chondroitin sulfate
substitution site. Bovine SZP and human MSF precursor sequences are
about 75% identical at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels.

Using a positional cloning approach, Marcelino et al. (1999) identified
the MSF gene within the chromosome 1q25-q31 critical region for the
autosomal recessive camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis
syndrome (CACP; 208250) locus. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that
a 4.5-kb MSF mRNA is expressed in several tissues, including liver,
lung, and heart, and is highly expressed in synovial tissue. A 30-kD
N-terminal MSF fragment was detectable in serum and urine.

By Northern blot analysis, Ikegawa et al. (2000) demonstrated limited
expression of the human PRG4 gene as 4.2- and 1.7-kb transcripts;
expression was strongest in liver, but was also observed in heart,
brain, and muscle. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated strong expression in
cartilage. RT-PCR also detected 4 types of alternative splicing. Type A
consisted of exons 1-6, type B of exons 1 and 3-5, type C of exons 1-3,
and type D of exons 1 and 3. Resultant deletions caused by skipping
these exons were all in-frame. Types A and B were expressed
ubiquitously; types C and D showed tissue-limited expression.

The cells of hematopoietic and vascular endothelial cell lineages are
believed to share a common precursor, termed the hemangioblast. Liu et
al. (2004) reported the identification of hemangiopoietin (HAPO), a
novel growth factor acting on both hematopoietic and endothelial cell
lineages. The cDNA clone encoding HAPO is an alternative splicing
variant lacking exon 5 of PRG4, as demonstrated by a comparative cDNA
sequence analysis of HAPO and PRG4. Liu et al. (2004) suggested that
HAPO may have a clinical potential in the treatment of various
cytopenias and radiation injury and in the expansion of hematopoietic
and endothelial stem/progenitor cells.

Jay et al. (2000) purified lubricin from pooled synovial fluid with
normal lubricating activity that was obtained from patients with
osteoarthritis. Purified lubricin has an apparent molecular mass of 280
kD by SDS-PAGE; deglycosylation decreased the apparent molecular mass to
120 kD. Sequencing revealed a 100% match with exons 6 to 9 of the MSF
gene. Lubricin exhibited boundary-lubricating activity similar to that
of whole synovial fluid. Jay et al. (2000) concluded that lubricin is
secreted by synovial fibroblasts. They stated that lubricin is the only
lubricating component in the final lubricating fraction of human
synovial fluid.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ikegawa et al. (2000) determined that the human and mouse PRG4 genes
each contain 12 exons and that they span 18 and 16 kb, respectively.

MAPPING

Using a positional cloning approach, Marcelino et al. (1999) identified
the MSF gene within the chromosome 1q25-q31 critical region for the
autosomal recessive camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis
syndrome (CACP; 208250) locus.

By FISH, Ikegawa et al. (2000) mapped the human PRG4 gene to chromosome
1q24-q25. By the same method they mapped the mouse mouse Prg4 gene to
chromosome 1G, in a region showing syntenic homology to human 1q24-q25.

GENE FUNCTION

Jay et al. (2007) used a multiple-particle-tracking microrheology
technique to study the molecular interaction between lubricin and
hyaluronic acid in bovine synovial fluid. They found that lubricin
affects the diffusive behavior of synovial fluid and contributes to the
elastic absorption and energy dissipation of synovial fluid at
physiologic shear frequencies. In studies involving synovial fluid from
a patient with camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis,
hyaluronic acid molecules adopted an extended and more rigid
conformation, suggesting that synovial fluid lacking lubricin would be
less able to dissipate the energy of impact that occurs during mammalian
locomotion. Jay et al. (2007) concluded that lubricin provides a
chondroprotective feature to synovial fluid that is distinct from the
role lubricin plays at the cartilage surface as a boundary lubricant.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Marcelino et al. (1999) identified 8 likely disease-causing mutations in
the MSF gene in patients with CACP from consanguineous families. Four
were homozygous deletions. Additionally, they detected a dinucleotide
transversion that created a nonsense codon, and a 41-bp insertion 14
nucleotides upstream of the intron 6 splice acceptor site that disrupted
the polypyrimidine tract of the splice site. Each of these mutations was
predicted to result in a truncated protein. Due to its high
glycosylation content and mucin-like repeats, Marcelino et al. (1999)
suggested that MSF may act as a joint/intimal cell lubricant. Both
synovial and pericardial cell hyperplasia may represent secondary
consequences of insufficient cell surface lubrication. Alternatively,
cell overgrowth may be primary to the pathogenesis of CACP.

ANIMAL MODEL

Rhee et al. (2005) generated Prg4 -/- mice, in which joints appeared
normal at birth; with aging there were abnormal protein deposits on the
cartilage surface, disappearance of underlying superficial zone
chondrocytes, and hyperplasia of intimal cells in the synovium. Purified
or recombinant lubricin inhibited the growth of those synoviocytes in
vitro. Tendon and tendon sheath involvement was present in the ankle
joints, with morphologic changes and abnormal calcification. Rhee et al.
(2005) concluded that lubricin has multiple functions in articulating
joints and tendons that include the protection of surfaces and control
of synovial cell growth.

608711	TITLE *608711 CTD SMALL PHOSPHATASE 2; CTDSP2
;;SMALL CTD PHOSPHATASE 2; SCP2;;
CONSERVED GENE AMPLIFIED IN OSTEOSARCOMA 4; OS4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing genes within a region of chromosome 12 amplified in
sarcomas and brain tumors, Su et al. (1997) cloned CTDSP2, which they
designated OS4. The deduced 283-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 31.8 kD. Northern blot analysis detected expression in
all tissues examined, with highest expression in pancreas and lowest
expression in brain, lung, and liver.

Yeo et al. (2003) determined that the phosphatase domain of CTDSP2
shares more than 90% homology with the phosphatase domains of CTDSP1
(605323) and CTDSPL (608592).

GENE FUNCTION

Su et al. (1997) found that expression of CTDSP2 mRNA was enhanced in
several cancer cell lines with amplification of the CTDSP2 and CDK4
(123829) genes. CTDSP2 was also coamplified with CDK4 in 5 of 5 primary
sarcomas. Su et al. (1997) hypothesized that CTDSP2 may contribute to
the development of a subset of sarcomas.

Using the synthetic substrate para-nitrophenylphosphate in an in vitro
phosphatase assay, Yeo et al. (2003) determined that CTDSP2 has
phosphatase activity similar to that of SCP1, with Mg(2+)-dependent
activity and a pH optimum near 5.0.

Neuronal gene transcription is repressed in nonneuronal cells by the
repressor element-1 (RE1)-silencing transcription
factor/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF; 600571) complex.
To understand how this silencing is achieved, Yeo et al. (2005) examined
CTDSP1, CTDSP2, and CTDSPL, the small CTD phosphatases (SCP), whose
expression is restricted to nonneuronal tissues. Yeo et al. (2005)
showed that REST/NRSF recruits SCPs to neuronal genes that contain RE1
elements, leading to neuronal gene silencing in nonneuronal cells.
Phosphatase-inactive forms of SCP interfere with REST/NRSF function and
promote neuronal differentiation of P19 stem cells. Likewise, small
interfering RNA directed to the single Drosophila SCP unmasks neuronal
gene expression in S2 cells. Thus, Yeo et al. (2005) concluded that SCP
activity is an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulator that
acts globally to silence neuronal genes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chang et al. (2008) showed that the CTDSP2 gene has 8 exons and that
intron 5 contains the microRNA MIRN26A2.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Su et al. (1997) mapped the CTDSP2 gene to
chromosome 12q13-q15, where it lies about 60 kb telomeric to the CDK4
gene.

603761	TITLE *603761 RAD9, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF, A; RAD9A
;;RAD9, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF; RAD9
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In S. pombe, rad9 is one of 6 genes essential for both the incomplete
DNA replication (S-M) and DNA damage checkpoints. See HUS1 (603760). By
searching an EST database, Lieberman et al. (1996) identified a partial
cDNA encoding HRAD9, a human rad9 homolog. The authors used the partial
cDNA to recover additional human RAD9 cDNAs corresponding to the entire
coding region. The predicted 391-amino acid human protein is 25%
identical to S. pombe rad9.

GENE FUNCTION

Lieberman et al. (1996) found that the human RAD9 gene partially
complemented the hydroxyurea sensitivity, radiosensitivity, and
checkpoint defects of rad9-null mutant cells.

On immunoblots of mammalian cell extracts, Volkmer and Karnitz (1999)
found that human RAD9 migrated at 70 kD, even though it has a predicted
molecular mass of 45 kD. The authors attributed this discrepancy to
complex posttranslational modifications. In vivo, the human RAD9 protein
was phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, suggesting that it
participates in a DNA damage-inducible signaling pathway.
Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that the fully modified form of
RAD9 interacts selectively with RAD1 (603153) and HUS1 in a stable
complex. Volkmer and Karnitz (1999) concluded that these 3 proteins are
central components of a DNA damage-responsive protein complex in human
cells.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by analysis of somatic cell
hybrids, Lieberman et al. (1996) mapped the RAD9 gene to 11q13.1-q13.2.
They found that the 3-prime end of the RAD9 cDNA contains sequences from
the 3-prime untranslated region of PPP1CA (176875), indicating that the
2 genes are transcribed in opposite orientations.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Maniwa et al. (2005) found that a functional human RAD9 protein
accumulated in the nuclei of nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (211980)
cells. Maniwa et al. (2006) examined the RAD9 sequence in tumor and
peripheral normal lung tissues, and the expression of its mRNA using
RT-PCR. No sequence alterations were detected in the RAD9 gene, which
was found to be normally transcribed in surgically resected lung
carcinoma cells. However, in 8 (16%) cases a SNP was observed at the
second position of codon 239 (his/arg heterozygous variant) of the gene.
This frequency was significantly higher than that found in the normal
population.

603940	TITLE *603940 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, SUBFAMILY K, MEMBER 7; KCNK7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the tandem pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, such
as TWIK1 (601745) and TREK (603219), contain 4 transmembrane domains and
2 pore-forming (P) domains. See KCNK6 (603939). By searching an EST
database for sequences related to mouse Kcnk6, Salinas et al. (1999)
isolated a human cDNA encoding a novel potassium channel, which they
designated KCNK7. RT-PCR revealed that exon skipping gives rise to 5
mRNA species encoding 3 protein forms, KCNK7-A, -B, and -C. The
predicted 307-amino acid KCNK7A form is the longest; KCNK7B and KCNK7C
have truncated cytoplasmic C termini. Sequence analysis revealed that
the KCNK7 protein contains 4 potential transmembrane segments and 2 P
domains. The P2 domain contains a very unconventional GLE motif instead
of the GLG found in TWIK1 and KCNK6 or the GFG found in other K2P
channels. The core region spanning the 4 transmembrane domains of KCNK7A
shares 80% and 42% protein sequence identity with those of Kcnk6 and
TWIK1, respectively. As with Kcnk6, none of the KCNK7 protein forms were
able to generate channel activity when expressed in mammalian cells.

MAPPING

By analysis of radiation hybrids, Salinas et al. (1999) mapped the KCNK7
gene to 11q13.

607309	TITLE *607309 ADAPTOR-RELATED PROTEIN COMPLEX 1, MU-2 SUBUNIT; AP1M2
;;MU-1B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AP1M2 is a member of the medium chain family of the clathrin-associated
adaptor complex AP1. It is expressed exclusively in epithelial cells and
may mediate basolateral sorting of membrane proteins in polarized
epithelial cells.

CLONING

By EST database searching using mouse Ap1m1 (603535) as the query,
followed by screening a placenta cDNA library, Ohno et al. (1999) cloned
a full-length cDNA encoding AP1M2, which they designated mu-1B. The
deduced 423-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 48 kD
and shares 97% sequence identity with the mouse Ap1m2 protein. Northern
blot analysis revealed expression restricted to placenta, lung, kidney,
pancreas, prostate, testis, small intestine, and colon. Dot blot
analysis revealed mRNA in stomach, pituitary gland, salivary gland, and
trachea. Northern blot analysis of cultured cell lines showed expression
restricted to most, but not all, polarized epithelial cells. In situ
hybridization on mouse embryos revealed highest levels of Ap1m2 mRNA
within intestinal mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, acinar cells of
the pancreas, epithelial cells of hair follicles, and secretory cells
(ameloblasts and odontoblasts) in developing teeth. In vivo
transcription/translation resulted in a protein with an apparent
molecular mass of about 47 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Ohno et al. (1999) determined that AP1M2
interacts with a subset of tyrosine-based sorting signals. Folsch et al.
(1999) noted that LLC-PK1 porcine kidney epithelial cells do not express
Ap1m2 and missort basolateral proteins, which are normally targeted
through a tyrosine-based sorting signal, to the apical surface. Stable
expression of AP1M2 selectively restored basolateral targeting, improved
the overall organization of LLC-PK1 monolayers, and had no effect on
apical targeting.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nakatsu et al. (1999) determined that the mouse Ap1m2 gene consists of
11 exons and spans approximately 21 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Nakatsu et al. (1999) mapped the AP1M2 gene to chromosome
19p13.2. Using interspecific backcross analysis, they mapped the mouse
Ap1m2 gene to the proximal region of chromosome 9, which shows homology
of synteny to human 19p13.2.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chicheportiche et al. (1997) isolated a novel tumor necrosis factor
(TNF; 191160) family member from mouse peritoneal macrophage mRNA. They
also cloned a homologous human cDNA encoding a predicted 249-amino acid
protein they called TWEAK. The TWEAK protein sequence contains the
single transmembrane domain common to TNF family members. Northern blot
analysis revealed that the 1.4-kb mRNA was expressed at varying levels
in many human tissues and cells.

- TWEAK/APRIL Spliced Read-Through Transcript

By RACE, RT-PCR, and screening of a T-cell cDNA library, Pradet-Balade
et al. (2002) isolated a hybrid transcript formed by intergenic splicing
of exons 1 through 6 of TWEAK to exons 2 through 6 of APRIL (TNFSF13;
604472) using the splice donor/acceptor sites of TWEAK and APRIL mRNAs.
The deduced in-frame fusion protein, which the authors called TWEPRIL,
has a calculated molecular mass of 38 kD. TWEPRIL begins at the
initiation codon of TWEAK and contains the intracellular, transmembrane,
and stalk regions of TWEAK fused to the extracellular receptor-binding
domain of APRIL. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.5-kb TWEPRIL
transcript in resting and activated human primary T cells, in monocytic
cell lines, and in colorectal carcinoma cell lines. Transfected human
embryonic kidney cells expressed TWEPRIL as a 48-kD membrane protein.
TWEPRIL appeared to form SDS-stable aggregates that were likely trimers.
Western blot analysis revealed a 48-kD endogenous TWEPRIL protein in
human primary T cells and monocytic cell lines.

Using Northern blot analysis, Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) found that
relative expression of the 1.9-kb APRIL transcript was about 6-fold
higher than that of the 2.5-kb TWEPRIL transcript in resting T cells.
However, in activated T cells, both transcripts were expressed at
similar levels. A similar expression pattern for APRIL and TWEPRIL was
detected in CD4 (186940)-positive and CD8 (see 186910)-positive T-cell
subpopulations. TWEAK expression was similar between resting and
activated T cells. TWEAK was found predominantly in ribosome-free
fractions in both resting and activated T cells, whereas APRIL and
TWEPRIL increased their association with polyribosomes following T-cell
activation, suggesting that translational efficiency of APRIL and
TWEPRIL increases upon T-cell activation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the TNFSF12 gene contains 7
exons.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid panel, Marsters et al. (1998) mapped
the APO3L gene to 17p13. Using the same technique, Chicheportiche et al.
(1997) refined the map position to 17p13.3.

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the TNFSF12 gene lies 878 bp
upstream of the putative transcriptional start site of the TNFSF13 gene
on chromosome 17p13.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Chicheportiche et al. (1997) found that expressed TWEAK protein was
secreted from cells, probably following proteolytic cleavage. TWEAK
could induce synthesis of IL8 (146930) from several cell types. Purified
TWEAK induced apoptotic death of HT29 cells cultured with human
interferon-gamma (147570).

Marsters et al. (1998) found that TNFSF12, which they called APO3L,
binds to the death domain-containing receptor DR3 (TNFRSF25; 603366).
They characterized the expression pattern of APO3L, as well as its
ability to induce apoptosis and NF-kappa-B (see 164011) activation in
human cell lines, and found that APO3L has overlapping signaling
functions with TNF, but displays a much wider tissue distribution.
Schneider et al. (1999), however, showed that soluble TWEAK induced
apoptosis of a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line through the
autocrine/paracrine action of induced TNF and proposed that TWEAK used a
receptor distinct from TNFRSF25. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated
binding of TWEAK to a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, but Western blot and
RNase protection analyses failed to detect the presence of TNFRSF25 on
the cells.

Using flow cytometry and binding analyses, Kaptein et al. (2000) could
not detect binding of TWEAK or any other known TNF ligand to WSL1
(TNFRSF25). They observed that cells devoid of WSL1 or cells from
knockout mice lacking Wsl1 were TWEAK responsive.

Using techniques similar to those of Marsters et al. (1998), Wiley et
al. (2001) could not reproduce their results showing a TWEAK-APO3
interaction. Wiley et al. (2001) identified TWEAKR (TNFRSF12A; 605914),
a small protein with a cysteine-rich motif and a TRAF (see TRAF5;
602356)-binding site, as the TWEAK receptor. TWEAKR shares homology with
some TNFRs and is a fully functional member of the TNFR family. Blocking
of TWEAKR signaling inhibited the migration of renal microvascular cells
in vitro, indicating that endogenous TWEAK regulates endothelial cell
wound closure rates. Wiley et al. (2001) concluded that the TWEAK-TWEAKR
system plays a role in endothelial cell growth and migration.

Tian et al. (2004) demonstrated a direct interaction between TWEAK and
VG5Q (608464), a secreted angiogenic factor that is mutated in some
cases of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (149000).

Jain et al. (2009) analyzed circulating TWEAK levels in 56 patients with
heart failure and 14 age-matched controls, and found that circulating
TWEAK levels were differentially upregulated in patients with idiopathic
dilated cardiomyopathy (see CMD1A, 115200) compared to patients with
coronary artery disease (see CHDS1, 607339) or hypertension (145500) or
controls. Circulating TWEAK levels did not, however, correlate with
clinical functional parameters in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

- TWEAK/APRIL Spliced Read-Through Transcript

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) found that Jurkat human T cells and Ramos
human B cells cocultured with TWEPRIL-transfected 293T cells showed an
even greater increase in cell growth compared with controls than did
Jurkat human T cells cocultured with APRIL-transfected 293T cells. They
concluded that TWEPRIL is a membrane-bound protein that can induce
proliferation in a manner comparable with APRIL.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using transgenic or adenoviral-mediated gene expression in mice, Jain et
al. (2009) induced elevated circulating levels of TWEAK and observed the
development of dilated cardiomyopathy with subsequent severe cardiac
dysfunction. This phenotype was mediated exclusively by Tweakr,
independent of TNFA, and was associated with cardiomyocyte elongation
and cardiac fibrosis but not cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

KIAA0157
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In a bioinformatics analysis to reveal proteins related to Abraxas
(ABRA1; 611143), Wang et al. (2007) identified the KIAA0157 protein
(Nagase et al., 1995). The 415-amino acid protein, which Wang et al.
(2007) designated ABRO1 for 'Abraxas brother-1,' shares 39% identity to
ABRA1 in the N-terminal two-thirds of the protein (amino acids 1 to
260), including a coiled-coil domain and a region called the ABR domain.
However, ABRO1 lacks the phosphorylated ser-X-X-phe motif of ABRA1 and,
unlike ABRA1, does not bind to BRCA1 (113705).

MAPPING

By PCR of a panel of human-rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al.
(1995) mapped the FAM175B gene to chromosome 10.

;;EIF3-p35;;
EIF3-ALPHA;;
EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 3, SUBUNIT 1, FORMERLY; EIF3S1,
FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Eukaryotic initiation factor-3 (EIF3) has a molecular mass of about 600
kD and contains 13 nonidentical protein subunits, including EIF3J. EIF3
plays a central role in binding of initiator methionyl-tRNA and mRNA to
the 40S ribosomal subunit to form the 40S initiation complex (Fraser et
al., 2004; Fraser et al., 2007).

CLONING

By searching an EST database with partial protein sequences of the human
eIF3-p35 and eIF3-p44 (EIF3G; 603913) subunits, Block et al. (1998)
isolated cDNAs encoding p35 and p44. The predicted p35 protein contains
258 amino acids. Both p44 and p35 coimmunoprecipitated with p170,
indicating that they are components of the eIF3 complex. Northern blot
analysis revealed that p35 is expressed as an approximately 2.4-kb mRNA
in HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using insect cells to express EIF3 subunits and an in vitro binding
assay, Fraser et al. (2004) identified EIF3J as the EIF3 component
required for stable 40S binding. EIF3J promoted binding of a core
subcomplex made up of EIF3B (603917), EIF3G, and EIF3I (603911).
Purified EIF3 lacking EIF3J bound 40S ribosomal subunits weakly, but it
bound tightly when EIF3J was added. Cleavage of a 16-residue C-terminal
peptide from EIF3J by caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636) reduced its affinity for
the 40S ribosomal subunit, and the cleaved form provided substantially
less stabilization of purified EIF3-40S complexes.

Fraser et al. (2007) found that EIF3J bound directly to the mRNA entry
channel and aminoacyl site of the 40S subunit, placing EIF3J directly in
the ribosomal decoding center. EIF3J also interacted with EIF3A (602039)
and reduced 40S subunit affinity for mRNA. High affinity for mRNA was
restored upon recruitment of initiator tRNA, even though EIF3J remained
in the mRNA-binding cleft in the presence of tRNA. Fraser et al. (2007)
concluded that EIF3J governs the binding of initiation factors and mRNA
to form the initiation complex.

607402	TITLE *607402 INTERFERON, LAMBDA-3; IFNL3
;;INTERLEUKIN 28B; IL28B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IL28B is a class II cytokine receptor (e.g., IFNAR1; 107450) ligand
related to type I interferons (e.g., IFNA2; 147562). These ligands play
a critical role in response to microbial challenge and activate the JAK
(e.g., JAK1; 147795)/STAT (e.g., STAT1; 600555) signaling system
(Sheppard et al., 2003).

CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sheppard et al. (2003) identified genes
encoding IL28A (607401), IL28B, and IL29 (607403). The deduced 200-amino
acid IL28B protein is 96% identical to IL28A and 81% identical to IL29,
but it shares only low homology with IL10 (124092), IFNA2, and IL22
(605330). IL28B has a conserved cysteine pattern and amphipathic profile
similar to other helical cytokine family members.

GENE FUNCTION

By RT-PCR analysis, Sheppard et al. (2003) determined that treatment of
mononuclear cells and other cell types with double-stranded RNA or viral
infection induced transcription of IL28 and IL29. Addition of IL28,
IL29, or IFNA2 also induced protection from virus challenge infection,
but IL28 and IL29 did not display antiproliferative activity. Luciferase
reporter analysis indicated that IL28 and IL29 signal through
IFN-stimulated response elements. However, IL28 and IL29 did not bind to
IFNAR1, but instead bound to and signaled through a novel receptor,
IL28RA (607404), partnered with IL10RB (123889). Sheppard et al. (2003)
proposed that IL28 and IL29 represent an evolutionary link between type
I IFNs and the IL10 family and may serve as an alternative therapeutic
choice to type I IFNs.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Sheppard et al. (2003) determined that the
IL28B gene contains 6 exons, in contrast to the related type I IFNs,
which are encoded by a single exon. Analysis of 5-prime regulatory
regions suggested the presence of DNA-binding elements involved in type
I IFN regulation.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sheppard et al. (2003) mapped the IL28A,
IL28B, and IL29 genes to chromosome 19q13.13, a localization distinct
from that of the related type I IFNs, which are colocalized on
chromosome 9.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Association with Hepatitis C Virus Treatment Response

Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV; see 609532) affects 170
million people worldwide and is the leading cause of cirrhosis in North
America. The recommended treatment for chronic HCV infection involves a
48-week course of pegylated interferon-alpha-2b or -alpha-2a combined
with ribavirin (RBV). However, many patients are not cured by treatment,
and patients of European ancestry have a significantly higher
probability of being cured than patients of African ancestry. Ge et al.
(2009) performed a genomewide association study on more than 1,600
individuals chronically infected with HCV who were participating in a
clinical treatment trial. They identified a SNP 3 kb upstream of the
IL28B gene, dbSNP rs12979860, that was strongly associated with
sustained virologic response (SVR), defined as the absence of detectable
virus at the end of follow-up evaluation. The CC genotype of dbSNP
rs12979860 was associated with an approximately 2-fold greater rate of
SVR compared with the TT genotype, both among patients of European
ancestry (P of 1.06 x 10(-25)) and African Americans (P of 2.06 x
10(-3)). Because the CC genotype was substantially more frequent in
European than African populations, Ge et al. (2009) estimated that dbSNP
rs12979860 could explain approximately half of the difference in SVR
between African Americans and patients of European ancestry. They
sequenced the IL28B gene in 96 individuals and identified 2 variants
that were highly associated with dbSNP rs12979860: a G-C SNP 37 bp
upstream of the translation initiation codon (dbSNP rs28416183), and a
nonsynonymous coding SNP that produces a lys70-to-arg (K70R)
substitution (dbSNP rs8103142). Ge et al. (2009) could not resolve
which, if any, of these 3 SNPs was uniquely responsible for the
association with SVR and suggested that functional studies were needed.

To address the role of dbSNP rs12979860 in HCV clearance, Thomas et al.
(2009) genotyped 1,008 people from 6 independent HCV cohorts. The
frequency of the C allele was greater in individuals of European than
those of African ancestry in both HCV clearance (P of 3 x 10(-10)) and
persistence (P of 1 x 10(-21)) groups. However, the frequency of the C
allele versus the T allele was much greater in the clearance group in
both ethnic groups, with frequencies of 80.3% versus 66.7%,
respectively, in individuals of European ancestry (P of 7 x 10(-8)) and
56.2% versus 37%, respectively, in individuals of African ancestry (P of
1 x 10(-5)). Patients with the CC genotype were 3 times more likely to
clear HCV relative to patients with CT and TT genotypes combined (OR =
0.33, P = 10(-12) for combined ethnic groups), and the protective effect
of the C allele seemed to be recessive. The protective effect of the C
allele was independent of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B
virus surface antigen status, route of HCV acquisition, and other known
host genetic factors. Genotyping of populations worldwide showed that
the C allele was nearly fixed throughout east Asia, had an intermediate
frequency in Europe, and was a minor allele in Africa. The frequencies
in Central and South America were also intermediate, suggesting
selective pressure since migration from Asia. Thomas et al. (2009) noted
that dbSNP rs12979860 is in strong linkage disequilibrium with a
nonsynonymous coding SNP, dbSNP rs8103142, that could alter the function
of IL28B and explain the association, but that tests for functional
differences were needed to define the biologic mechanism. Thomas et al.
(2009) concluded that dbSNP rs12979860 is associated with both HCV
treatment response and with natural clearance of HCV.

To identify genetic variants associated with HCV treatment response,
Suppiah et al. (2009) conducted a genomewide association study of SVR to
PEG-IFN-alpha/RBV combination therapy in 293 Australian individuals with
genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C, with validation in an independent
replication cohort consisting of 555 individuals. They reported an
association to SVR with the SNP dbSNP rs8099917 (combined P = 9.25 x
10(-9), OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.57-2.52), within the gene region encoding
IL28B. IL28B contributes to viral resistance and is known to be
upregulated by interferons and by RNA virus infection. Suppiah et al.
(2009) concluded that their data suggested that host genetics may be
useful for the prediction of drug response, and also supported the
investigation of the role of IL28B in the treatment of HCV and in other
diseases treated with IFNA.

Tanaka et al. (2009) reported a genomewide association study to null
virologic response (NVR) in the treatment of patients with hepatitis C
virus genotype 1 within a Japanese population. Tanaka et al. (2009)
found 2 SNPs near the gene IL28B on chromosome 19 to be strongly
associated with NVR (dbSNP rs12980275, P = 1.93 x 10(-13), and dbSNP
rs8099917, P = 3.11 x 10(-15)). Tanaka et al. (2009) replicated these
associations in an independent cohort (combined P values, 2.84 x 10(-27)
(OR = 17.7; 95% CI = 10.0-31.3) and 2.68 x 10(-32) (OR = 27.1; 95% CI =
14.6-50.3), respectively). These SNPs were also associated with SVR
(dbSNP rs12980275, P = 3.99 x 10(-24), and dbSNP rs8099917, P = 1.11 x
10(-27)). In further fine mapping of the region, 7 SNPs located in the
IL28B region showed the most significant associations (P = 5.52 x
10(-28) to 2.68 x 10(-32); OR = 22.3-27.1). Real-time quantitative PCR
assays in peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed lower IL28B
expression levels in individuals carrying the minor alleles (P = 0.015).

;;VTI1RP2
VTI1A/TCF7L2 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

VTI1A is a soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment
protein (SNAP; see 603215) receptor (SNARE) that functions in the
transport of vesicles between the Golgi apparatus and the plasma
membrane (Flowerdew and Burgoyne, 2009).

CLONING

Xu et al. (1998) cloned mouse Vti1a, which they called Vti1rp2. The
deduced 217-amino acid protein has 4 putative coiled-coil regions and a
C-terminal transmembrane domain. The final coiled-coil region includes
an ATP/GTP-binding motif A (P loop). Northern blot analysis detected a
2.6-kb transcript in all mouse tissues examined except testis, which
expressed a 1.5-kb Vti1a transcript. Western blot analysis and
differential extraction of fractionated rat liver membranes revealed
that Vti1a was an integral Golgi membrane protein.

By immunohistochemical analysis of HeLa cells, Flowerdew and Burgoyne
(2009) found that human VTI1A showed a punctate vesicular distribution.

GENE FUNCTION

Using protein pull-down assays, Xu et al. (1998) showed that mouse Vti1a
interacted with alpha-SNAP (NAPA; 603215). Coimmunoprecipitation
analysis revealed that Vti1a interacted with 2 distinct SNARE complexes
that contained either syntaxin-5 (STX5; 603189) or syntaxin-6 (STX6;
603944). Immunodepletion of Vti1a from Vero monkey kidney cells
interfered with plasma membrane trafficking of vesicular-stomatitis
virus G protein (VSVG), resulting in accumulation of VSVG in the Golgi
apparatus.

Flowerdew and Burgoyne (2009) showed that potassium channel-interacting
protein-1 (KCHIP1, or KCNIP1; 604660) interacted with the
channel-forming Kv4.2 potassium channel subunit (KCND2; 605410) and was
required for Kv4.2 trafficking to the plasma membrane. Using HeLa and
mouse Neuro2A neuroblastoma cells, they found that KCHIP1 and Kv4.2 used
an intracellular vesicle trafficking pathway that included VTI1A and
VAMP7 (300053) and required the GTPase RAB1 (179508), which is shared
with more conventional vesicle-trafficking pathways. Knockdown of VTI1A
or VAMP7 inhibited transport of Kv4.2 and KCHIP1 to the plasma membrane,
but it had no effect on membrane transport of VSVG.

CYTOGENETICS

- VTI1A/TCF7L2 Fusion Gene

Bass et al. (2011) reported whole-genome sequencing from 9 individuals
with colorectal cancer (114500), including primary colorectal tumors and
matched adjacent nontumor tissues, at an average of 30.7x and 31.9x
coverage, respectively. They identified an average of 75 somatic
rearrangements per tumor, including complex networks of translocations
between pairs of chromosomes. Eleven rearrangements encode predicted
in-frame fusion proteins, including a fusion of VTI1A and TCF7L2
(602278) found in 3 out of 97 colorectal cancers. Although TCF7L2
encodes TCF4, which cooperates with beta-catenin (116806) in colorectal
carcinogenesis, the fusion lacks the TCF4 beta-catenin-binding domain.
Bass et al. (2011) found a colorectal carcinoma cell line harboring the
fusion gene to be dependent on VTI1A-TCF7L2 for anchorage-independent
growth using RNA interference-mediated knockdown.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the VTI1A gene to chromosome 10q25.2 based on an
alignment of the VTI1A sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC017052) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;CYTOCHROME P450, SUBFAMILY IVF, POLYPEPTIDE 8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By RT-PCR of human seminal vesicles using degenerate CYP4 primers as
probe, Bylund et al. (1999) cloned CYP4F8. The deduced 520-amino acid
protein has a heme-binding region and conserved heme ligand cys468.
CYP4F8 shares 81.2% and 76.7% amino acid identity with CYP4F2 (604426)
and CYP4F3 (601270), respectively. Northern blot analysis of human
seminal vesicles detected 2.1-kb and 2.3-kb transcripts.

By immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis of a wide range of
tissues, Stark et al. (2003) localized CYP4F8 to human seminal vesicle
epithelium, epidermis, corneal epithelium, and proximal renal tubules.
Staining in healthy epidermis extended from the basal cell to granular
cell layers. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected 2.1-,
2.5-, and 5.8-kb transcripts in kidney and liver, and 2.1- and 2.5-kb
transcripts in seminal vesicles. RT-PCR analysis confirmed CYP4F8
expression in scalp hair roots. RT-PCR and immunohistochemical studies
showed increased CYP4F8 mRNA and protein expression in psoriatic lesions
compared to unaffected epidermis in 4 patients with psoriasis (see
177900).

By RT-PCR, immunohistochemical analysis, and in situ hybridization,
Stark et al. (2005) detected CYP4F8 expression in epithelial linings of
seminal vesicles and the ampulla of the vas deferens and in transitional
epithelium of the ureter and bladder. Immunofluorescence studies
colocalized CYP4F8 protein with PTGS2 (600262) in distal vas deferens
epithelium.

GENE FUNCTION

Using CYP4F8 expressed in yeast, Bylund et al. (2000) demonstrated that
CYP4F8 catalyzed omega-2-hydroxylation of prostaglandin H1 (PGH1) and
prostaglandin H2 (PGH2). CYP4F8 showed little activity against
prostaglandins D2, E1, E2, F2-alpha, and leukotriene B4. Stark et al.
(2005) showed that CYP4F8 metabolized prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) and a
stable analog of PGI2 to 19-hydroxyl compounds.

Stark et al. (2005) characterized CYP4F8 enzyme activity against
polyunsaturated long chain fatty acids. CYP4F8 catalyzed epioxidation of
docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) and docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-3) and
omega-3-hydroxylation of 22:5n-6, the latter forming 20-hydroxy-22:5n-6
as the main product. Single amino acid substitutions in substrate
recognition site-1 (SRS1) and SRS4 of CYP4F8 affected oxygenation of
arachidonic acid but did not affect oxygenation of PGH2 analogs.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bylund et al. (1999) determined that the CYP4F8 gene contains 13 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Bylund et al. (1999) mapped the CYP4F8
gene to chromosome 19p13.1.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Caspases are cysteine proteases that play a central role in apoptosis.
Caspase-8 (FLICE; 601763) may be the first enzyme of the proteolytic
cascade that is activated by the FAS ligand (FASL; 134638) and tumor
necrosis factor (TNF; 191160). Caspase-8 is recruited to FAS (134637)
and TNF receptor-1 (TNFR1; 191190) through interaction of its prodomain
with the death effector domain (DED) of the receptor-associating protein
FADD (602457). By searching EST databases for sequences related to FADD,
Shu et al. (1997) identified cDNAs encoding a protein that they
designated CASPER. The predicted 480-amino acid CASPER protein contains
2 DED-like modules at its N terminus and a C-terminal caspase-like
protease domain. However, CASPER is not a caspase since it lacks several
conserved amino acids found in all identified caspases. Northern blot
analysis detected several CASPER transcripts, with highest expression in
human skeletal muscle, pancreas, and heart.

The viral FLICE inhibitory proteins (v-FLIPs) contain 2 DEDs and block
the early signaling events of the cellular death receptors. By searching
EST databases for cellular homologs of v-FLIPs, Irmler et al. (1997)
isolated human cDNAs encoding 2 isoforms of FLIP. FLIP(L), the longer
isoform, contains 2 DEDs and a caspase-like domain, and FLIP(S), the
shorter isoform, contains only the 2 DEDs followed by a C-terminal
extension of approximately 50 amino acids.

Goltsev et al. (1997), Han et al. (1997), Hu et al. (1997), Inohara et
al. (1997), and Srinivasula et al. (1997) isolated FLIP cDNAs; they
designated the gene CASH (caspase homolog), MRIT (MACH-related inducer
of toxicity; 'mrit' also means 'death' in Sanskrit), I-FLICE (inhibitor
of FLICE), CLARP (caspase-like apoptosis regulatory protein), and FLAME1
(FADD-like antiapoptotic molecule-1), respectively. Han et al. (1997)
cloned a cDNA encoding an MRIT isoform, which they called MRIT-alpha-2,
that lacks the first DED.

Irmler et al. (1997) and Goltsev et al. (1997) isolated cDNAs encoding
the mouse homolog of FLIP.

By microarray analysis, Jun et al. (2001) demonstrated expression of the
CFLAR gene in human donor corneas.

GENE FUNCTION

Shu et al. (1997) showed that CASPER interacted with FADD, caspase-8
(601763), caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636), TRAF1 (601711), and TRAF2 (601895)
through distinct domains. Overexpression of CASPER or its C-terminal
protease-like domain potently induced apoptosis, whereas a deletion
mutant lacking 45 C-terminal residues inhibited TNF- and FAS-induced
apoptosis. Since this truncated form is encoded by a natural splice
variant of CASPER, Shu et al. (1997) suggested that alternative splicing
of CASPER may provide a mechanism to regulate apoptosis triggered by
cell death pathways.

Irmler et al. (1997) found that activation of T cells induced a
transient resistance to FAS-induced apoptotic signals that correlated
with increased expression of FLIP(L). High levels of FLIP(L) protein
were detected in melanoma cell lines and malignant melanoma tumors. The
authors concluded that FLIP may be implicated in tissue homeostasis as
an important regulator of apoptosis.

Han et al. (1997) found that, when expressed in mammalian cells, MRIT
simultaneously and independently interacted with FLICE and BCLX(L)
(600039), an antiapoptotic member of the BCL2 family. Han et al. (1997)
suggested that MRIT may function as a link between cell survival and
cell death pathways in mammalian cells.

In human islets, elevated glucose concentrations impair beta-cell
proliferation and induce beta-cell apoptosis via upregulation of the FAS
receptor. Maedler et al. (2002) observed expression of FLIP in human
pancreatic beta-cells of nondiabetic individuals and decreased
expression in tissue sections of type 2 diabetic patients. In vitro
exposure of islets from nondiabetic organ donors to high glucose levels
decreased FLIP expression and increased the percentage of apoptotic
beta-cells, in which FLIP was no longer detectable. Upregulation of
FLIP, by incubation with transforming growth factor beta (TGFB1; 190180)
or by transfection with an expression vector coding for FLIP, protected
beta cells from glucose-induced apoptosis, restored beta-cell
proliferation, and improved beta-cell function. The beneficial effects
of FLIP overexpression were blocked by an antagonistic anti-FAS
antibody, indicating the dependence of these effects on FAS receptor
activation. The data provided evidence for expression of FLIP in the
human beta cell and suggested a novel approach to prevent and treat
diabetes by switching FAS signaling from apoptosis to proliferation.

The biologic outcome of TNF treatment is determined by the balance
between NF-kappa-B (see 164011), which promotes survival, and JNK (see
601158), which promotes cell death. Chang et al. (2006) found that Jnk
activity controlled Tnf-induced cell death through proteasomal
processing of Flip(L) in mice. Instead of direct phosphorylation of
Flip(L), Jnk promoted accelerated decay of Flip(L) through
phosphorylation and activation of the ubiquitin ligase Itch (606409).
Jnk1 or Itch deficiency or treatment with a Jnk inhibitor rendered mice
resistant in 3 distinct models of Tnf-induced liver failure, and cells
from these mice did not show inducible Flip(L) ubiquitination and
degradation. Chang et al. (2006) concluded that JNK antagonizes
NF-kappa-B during TNF signaling by promoting proteasomal elimination of
FLIP(L).

Oberst et al. (2011) showed that development of caspase-8-deficient mice
is completely rescued by ablation of receptor-interacting protein
kinase-3 (RIPK3; 605817). Adult animals lacking both caspase-8 and Ripk3
displayed a progressive lymphoaccumulative disease resembling that seen
with defects in Cd95 (FAS; 134637) or Cd95 ligand (FASL; 134638), and
resisted the lethal effects of Cd95 ligation in vivo. Oberst et al.
(2011) found that caspase-8 prevents RIPK3-dependent necrosis without
inducing apoptosis by functioning in a proteolytically active complex
with CFLAR and that this complex is required for the protective
function.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hadano et al. (2001) determined that the CFLAR gene contains 14 exons
and spans about 48 kb. It is transcribed in the centromere-to-telomere
direction.

MAPPING

Han et al. (1997) used fluorescence in situ hybridization and
Srinivasula et al. (1997) used radiation hybrid mapping to localize the
FLIP gene to 2q33-q34. Based on sequence similarity to STSs, Irmler et
al. (1997) and Inohara et al. (1997) tentatively mapped the FLIP gene to
2q33. Irmler et al. (1997) noted that the FLIP gene colocalizes with
caspase-10 (CASP10; 601762) on 2q33, suggesting that these genes arose
by gene duplication. Hadano et al. (2001) determined that the CFLAR,
CASP10, and CASP8 (601763) genes are tandemly located within 200 kb.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yeh et al. (2000) observed that mice deficient in Cflar failed to
survive beyond embryonic day 10.5 and exhibited impaired heart
development, similar to mice lacking Fadd or Casp8. Unlike mice lacking
Fadd or Casp8, however, Cflar -/- embryonic fibroblasts were highly
sensitive to FASL- or TNF-induced apoptosis, showing rapid induction of
Casp3 and Casp8 activities. Both nuclear factor kappa-B and Jnk/Sapk
were activated in Cflar-deficient and wildtype cells in response to TNF.
Yeh et al. (2000) proposed that CFLAR cooperates with CASP8 and FADD
during embryonic development and regulates death factor-induced
apoptosis induced by FAS or TNFR1 engagement.

Huang et al. (2010) generated mice with conditional loss of Flip
expression in myeloid cells. These mice exhibited growth retardation,
premature death, and splenomegaly with extramedullary hematopoiesis.
They also showed increased circulating neutrophils with multiorgan
neutrophil infiltration. Monocytes were also increased, but macrophages
were reduced. In vitro, differentiation to macrophages was Flip
dependent. Huang et al. (2010) concluded that FLIP is necessary for
macrophage differentiation and homeostatic regulation of granulopoiesis.

;;ALK LYMPHOMA OLIGOMERIZATION PARTNER ON CHROMOSOME 17; ALO17;;
KIAA1618
RNF213/ALK FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RNF213 gene encodes a protein that possesses both ubiquitin ligase
activity and ATPase activity (Liu et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned partial RNF213, which they
designated KIAA1618. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its
3-prime end, and the deduced protein contains 1,415 amino acids. RT-PCR
ELISA detected moderate RNF213 expression in all adult and fetal tissues
and adult brain regions examined except skeletal muscle, where RNF213
expression was low.

By database analysis and 5-prime RACE of the immature human myeloid
leukemia cell line K562, Cools et al. (2002) cloned 2 splice variants of
RNF213, which they called ALO17. The deduced proteins contain 1,599 and
1,550 amino acids. Both proteins contain a potential N-terminal zinc
finger motif, but they differ in the presence or absence of a sequence
near the N terminus.

Kamada et al. (2011) noted that full-length RNF213 contains 5,256 amino
acids and contains a RING finger domain, suggesting E3 ubiquitin ligase
function, as well as an HMG-CoA reductase degradation domain and an AAA
ATPase domain. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis detected strong RNF213
expression in adult human spleen and leukocytes, followed by placenta
and lymph node. Strong expression was detected in human fetal leukocytes
and thymus, with low expression in both adult and fetal human brain.
RNF213 expression was detected in both polymorphonuclear and mononuclear
cell fractions and in B and T cell fractions. There was low but
significant expression of RNF213 in human umbilical vein endothelial
cells and human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Cellular
expression of mouse Rnf213 was detected in the white pulp of the spleen,
primary lymph node follicles, and thymocytes in the medulla of the
thymus.

Liu et al. (2011) cloned RNF213 and found that their sequence included a
2,500-bp longer 3-prime untranslated region (UTR) compared to a
previously registered sequence and also lacked exon 4. Two splicing
variants differing by exclusion or inclusion of exon 4 were detected in
cDNAs isolated from various tissues. The short isoform, which skips exon
4, was the major variant and was detected in all tissues examined.

MAPPING

By PCR of a human-rodent hybrid panel, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the
RNF213 gene to chromosome 17. Cools et al. (2002) mapped the RNF213 gene
to chromosome 17q25 by genomic sequence analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Liu et al. (2011) found that transfection of RNF213 into HeLa cells
resulted in expression of the protein throughout the cytosol with
partial association with the intracellular membrane and cytoskeleton.
The E3 activity of the RING finger domain was confirmed by
self-ubiquitination after transfecting full-length RNF213 cDNA into
HEK293 cells. In addition, ATPase activity was detected in vitro by free
phosphate releasing analysis using a recombinant RNF213 fragment
including the Walker motif. Thus, RNF213 is a protein that possesses
both ubiquitin ligase activity and ATPase activity.

CYTOGENETICS

In a patient with ALK (105590)-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma,
Cools et al. (2002) identified a t(2;17)(p23;q25) rearrangement that
resulted in splicing of exons of the ALO17 gene from chromosome 17q25 to
exons of the ALK gene from chromosome 2p23. The predicted fusion protein
contains 1,172 N-terminal amino acids of ALO17 fused to 562 amino acids
of ALK, including the ALK kinase domain. FISH analysis confirmed the
presence of 2 copies of the AOL17-ALK fusion in the neoplastic cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By linkage analysis and genomewide association analysis of 63 Japanese
patients with moyamoya disease (MYMY2; 607151) and 45 controls, Kamada
et al. (2011) found a significant association between disease and a
variant in the RNF213 gene (R4859K; 613768.0001).

In affected members of 41 Japanese families and 1 Korean family with
moyamoya disease, Liu et al. (2011) identified an R4810K substitution
(dbSNP ss179362673) in the RNF213 gene (613768.0002). The variant
segregated with the disorder, although some carriers of the variant did
not have moyamoya disease, indicating incomplete penetrance. The
mutation was initially found by linkage analysis followed by exome
sequencing in eight 3-generation families. Haplotype analysis indicated
a founder effect. A case-control study of 251 East Asian patients and
707 controls showed a significant association between R4810K and the
disorder (odds ratio of 111.8, p = 10 x 10(-119)). In vitro functional
expression studies in HEK293 cells showed that the R4810K protein was
expressed and localized normally within the cell, and had normal
ubiquitin activity. Direct sequencing identified 5 additional RNF213
variants in 7 of 64 East Asian cases, and 4 variants in 4 (8%) of 50
Caucasian cases (see, e.g., 613768.0003). Although these variants were
not found in controls, pathogenicity was difficult to prove. Liu et al.
(2011) postulated that variation in the RNF213 gene acts with
environmental factors to result in moyamoya disease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Liu et al. (2011) demonstrated that knockout of the RNF213 homologs in
zebrafish caused abnormal vascular development, including abnormal
sprouting vessels particularly in the head region.

MOYAMOYA DISEASE 2, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
RNF213, ARG4859LYS

In Japanese patients with moyamoya disease (607151), Kamada et al.
(2011) found a significant association between disease and a 14576G-A
transition in exon 60 of the RNF213 gene, resulting in an arg4859-to-lys
(R4859K) substitution. In 19 of 20 families, heterozygosity for the
variant was found in 39 (92.9%) of 41 patients with the disorder and in
13 (46.4%) of 28 family members without the disorder. Three (7.1%)
patients had the variant in the homozygous state. The overall p value
among familial cases was 4.2 x 10(-7). None of 15 family members without
the variant developed the disease. The variant was also present in
heterozygosity and homozygosity in 45 (71.4%) and 1 (1.6%) of 63
Japanese patients with sporadic disease, respectively, and in 6 (1.4%)
of 429 controls. There was no phenotypic difference between homozygous
and heterozygous carriers. Overall, carrying the variant conferred an
odds ratio of 190.8 for development of the disorder (p = 1.2 x 10(-43)).
The R4859K variant was not found in 400 Caucasian controls.

Miyatake et al. (2012) found the 14576G-A transition in 39 (95.1%) of 41
Japanese patients with familial moyamoya disease, in 129 (79.2%) of 163
Japanese patients with sporadic moyamoya disease, and in 5 (1.8%) of 283
Japanese control individuals. Fifteen of the 168 patients with the
variant carried it in the homozygous state, whereas all 5 controls
carried it in the heterozygous state. Most patients inherited the allele
from either or both unaffected parents; all parents were heterozygous
for the variant. Miyatake et al. (2012) concluded that heterozygosity
for the 14576G-A variant confers an odds ratio of 236 for development of
the disorder. Patients with the 14576G-A variant had an earlier age at
onset (as early as age 4 years) and tended to have a higher frequency of
infarcts, posterior cerebral artery involvement, bilateral involvement,
seizures, and intellectual impairment compared to patients without the
variant. However, heterozygosity for the variant was also found in adult
patients. Comparisons of clinical features between 5 parent-offspring
pairs who were heterozygous for the variant showed anticipation.

Miyatake et al. (2012) reported a Japanese brother and sister who were
heterozygous and homozygous for the 14576G-A mutation, respectively. The
homozygous brother had onset of recurrent strokes in early childhood,
with deterioration in cognitive function and residual symptoms,
including paresis, headache, and visual loss, whereas the heterozygous
sister had only 1 stroke at age 17 years and no residual symptoms. Brain
imaging showed more severe vascular occlusion in the homozygous brother.
The findings suggested a dosage effect for this variant.

MOYAMOYA DISEASE 2, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
RNF213, ARG4810LYS

In affected members of 41 Japanese families and 1 Korean family with
moyamoya disease (607151), Liu et al. (2011) identified a G-to-A
transition in the RNF213 gene, resulting in an arg4810-to-lys (R4810K)
substitution (dbSNP ss179362673) in a conserved residue. The variant
segregated with the disorder, although some carriers of the variant did
not have moyamoya disease, indicating incomplete penetrance. The
mutation was initially found by linkage analysis followed by exome
sequencing in eight 3-generation families. Haplotype analysis indicated
a founder effect. A case-control study of 251 East Asian patients and
707 controls showed a significant association between R4810K and the
disorder (odds ratio of 111.8, p = 10 x 10(-19)). The variant was found
in about 1% of controls in East Asian populations, and some Japanese
controls were homozygous for the variant, arguing against a gene dosage
effect. Although R4810K was identified in 3 populations, the population
attributable risks in the Japanese (145/161; 90%) and Korean (30/38;
79%) populations were larger than that in the Chinese population (12/52;
23%). In addition, R4810K was not present among Caucasian cases or
controls. In vitro functional expression studies in HEK293 cells showed
that the R4810K protein was expressed and localized normally within the
cell; the variant protein also had normal ubiquitin activity. Knockout
of the homologs in zebrafish caused abnormal vascular development,
including abnormal sprouting vessels particularly in the head region.
Liu et al. (2011) postulated that variation in the RNF213 gene acts with
environmental factors to result in moyamoya disease.

MOYAMOYA DISEASE 2, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
RNF213, ASP4013ASN

In an affected Caucasian father of Czech descent and 3 of his children
with moyamoya disease (607151), Liu et al. (2011) identified a G-to-A
transition in the RNF213 gene, resulting in an asp4013-to-asn (D4013N)
substitution. The variant was not found in 384 Caucasian controls. The
father had a mild ischemic stroke at age 30 years, and his mother had
died of ischemic stroke at age 35. The 3 children developed moyamoya
disease at ages 5, 9, and 3 years. One had involuntary movements and
another had signs of ischemic stroke. Diagnosis of the disorder was
confirmed by brain MRI. The variant was relatively highly conserved,
especially in mammals. In vitro functional expression studies in HEK293
cells showed that the D4013N protein had normal ubiquitin activity.

;;B-CELL CLL/LYMPHOMA 7; BCL7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chromosome 12q24.1 is the site of a recurrent breakpoint in high-grade
B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (BNHL). To identify the gene(s) in the
12q24.1 region, Zani et al. (1996) performed molecular cloning of a
3-way translocation t(8;14;12)(q24.1;q32.3;q24.1) in a Burkitt lymphoma
cell line; all translocation breakpoints were cloned and sequenced.
Analysis of the der(12)(12;14)(q24.1;q32.3) breakpoint showed a CpG
island from 12q24.1 juxtaposed in a tail-to-tail configuration with a
productively rearranged V-D-J heavy chain gene. A total of 4.5 kb of
genomic DNA was shown to contain a potential 92-bp exon within the
centromeric boundary of the CpG island. This was used as a probe to
identify an RNA transcript of 3.8 kb expressed at low levels in a wide
variety of normal tissues. The longest open reading frame predicted a
serine-rich protein of 231 amino acids. This protein, designated BCL7A
by the authors, showed homology with the actin-binding protein caldesmon
(114213).

Jadayel et al. (1998) identified 2 genes, BCL7B (605846) and BCL7C
(605847), encoding proteins that share 90% identity with the N-terminal
51 amino acids of BCL7A as well as 41% identity in the same region with
Drosophila and C. elegans sequences. They suggested that the 3 genes are
members of an evolutionarily conserved gene family.

CYTOGENETICS

In the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Wein 133 containing a 3-way
translocation, Zani et al. (1996) found that the BCL7A breakpoint
occurred within the first intron and resulted in a free-of-fusion
transcript between MYC (190080) and BCL7A, with exon 1 of BCL7A being
replaced by MYC exon 1. The normal, untranslocated allele of BCL7A was
also expressed without mutation. Another BNHLs with 12q24.1 cytogenetic
abnormalities showed biallelic rearrangement within the first intron of
BCL7A, which was adjacent to the breakpoint observed in Wein 133. Zani
et al. (1996) concluded that disruption of the N terminus of BCL7A
defined a new mechanism in the pathogenesis of a subset of high-grade
BNHL.

MAPPING

The BCL7A gene maps to chromosome 12q24.1 (Zani et al., 1996).

604725	TITLE *604725 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 2; USP2
;;UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE, 41-KD; UBP41
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitin (191339), a highly conserved protein involved in the
regulation of intracellular protein breakdown, cell cycle regulation,
and stress response, is released from degraded proteins by disassembly
of the polyubiquitin chains. The disassembly process is mediated by
ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs). Also see USP1 (603478).

CLONING

Using a double-screening method of bacteria expressing chick skeletal
muscle cDNA, Baek et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding a deduced
357-amino acid protein expressing deubiquitinating activity. Because
SDS-PAGE analysis indicated a 41-kD purified protein, the authors termed
the protein Ubp41.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the USP2
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP SHGC-132662).

131360	TITLE *131360 ENOLASE 2; ENO2
;;ENOLASE, GAMMA;;
ENOLASE, NEURON-SPECIFIC; NSE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The enolases (phosphopyruvate hydratase; EC 4.2.1.11) catalyze the
interconversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate in the
glycolytic pathway. The functional enzyme is a dimer made up of subunits
referred to as alpha, beta, and gamma. In mammals there are at least 3
isoforms of enolase characterized by different tissue distributions as
well as by distinct biochemical and immunologic properties. The gamma-,
or neuron-specific, enolase (ENO2) is the major form found in mature
neurons and in cells of neuronal origin. The alpha-, or nonneuronal,
enolase (ENO1; 172430) is a nearly ubiquitous form, found in almost all
tissues, and its expression precedes that of the other isoforms in the
early stage of embryonic development. The beta-, or muscle-specific,
enolase (ENO3; 131370) is present in adult skeletal muscle (summary by
Oliva et al., 1991).

GENE FUNCTION

Muller et al. (2012) proposed that homozygous deletions in passenger
genes in cancer deletions can expose cancer-specific therapeutic
vulnerabilities when the collaterally deleted gene is a member of a
functionally redundant family of genes carrying out an essential
function. The glycolytic gene ENO1 in the 1p36 locus is deleted in
glioblastoma, which is tolerated by the expression of ENO2. Muller et
al. (2012) showed that short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of ENO2
selectively inhibits growth, survival, and the tumorigenic potential of
ENO1-deleted GBM cells, and that the enolase inhibitor
phosphonoacetohydroxamate is selectively toxic to ENO1-deleted GBM cells
relative to ENO1-intact GBM cells or normal astrocytes. Muller et al.
(2012) suggested that the principle of collateral vulnerability should
be applicable to other passenger-deleted genes encoding functionally
redundant essential activities and provide an effective treatment
strategy for cancers containing such genomic events.

MAPPING

Enolase-2 is determined by a gene on chromosome 12 (Grzeschik, 1976).
Herbschleb-Voogt et al. (1978) confirmed assignment to chromosome 12 by
showing synteny with LDHB and PEPB in man-mouse hybrids. Mattei et al.
(1982) assigned ENO2 to 12p11-qter by study of cells trisomic for
12pter-p11. Law and Kao (1982) also assigned the gene to chromosome 12.
By in situ hybridization, Craig et al. (1989, 1990) localized ENO2 to
12p13. Oliva et al. (1991) demonstrated that the ENO2 gene contains 12
exons distributed over 9,213 nucleotides. The putative promoter region
lacks canonical TATA and CAAT boxes, is very G+C-rich, and contains
several potential regulatory sequences.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chow and Lee (1996) reported the cDNA sequence of DENN, a novel human
gene that is differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cells
(hence, the symbol DENN). Northern blot analysis revealed differential
levels of expression of a 6.5-kb DENN transcript in malignant cell lines
compared to normal human tissues, where expression was highest in fetal
brain and kidney and in adult testis, ovary, brain, and heart. In fetal
liver and in several human cancer cell lines, the authors identified
cDNAs representing alternative transcripts of DENN that harbor a
deletion of 129 bp encoding 43 amino acids. Present within the serine-
and leucine-rich DENN gene product is an arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid
(RGD) cellular adhesion motif and a leucine zipper-like motif.

Using the yeast interaction trap system to identify proteins that
interact with the death domain of the type-1 tumor necrosis factor
receptor (TNFR1; 191190), Schievella et al. (1997) isolated cDNAs
encoding 'MAP kinase-activating death domain' (MADD) protein.
Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitated proteins from various human cell
lines detected an approximately 200-kD MADD protein. The deduced
1,588-amino acid MADD protein contains a C-terminal death domain.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) cloned KIAA0358. The deduced protein
contains 1,581 amino acids and is nearly identical to DENN.

Chow et al. (1998) stated that the DENN and MADD cDNAs and proteins are
virtually identical. From genomic studies, they traced the alternative
splicing of a 129-bp fragment to an alternative 5-prime donor site
involving exon 7. The deduced longer DENN isoform has 1,587 amino acids.
Western blot analysis of human MOLT-4 T-lymphoblastic leukemic cell
proteins detected a doublet consisting of 138- and 142-kD polypeptides.
The authors found the DENN protein concentrated predominantly in the
cytosolic compartment of MOLT-4 cells but was restricted to the nuclear
compartment of PLC/PRF/5 hepatoma cells.

Efimova et al. (2004) identified 7 putative splice variants of MADD:
IG20 full-length (IG20FL), IG20, KIAA0358, MADD (also referred to as
DENN), IG20 short variant-2 (IG20SV2), DENNSV (also referred to as
IG20SV3), and IG20SV4. These variants arise from alternative splicing of
exons 13L, 16, 21, 26, and 34. IG20FL, the longest variant, is encoded
by all 36 exons of the MADD gene. RT-PCR detected variable expression of
IG20, MADD, IG20SV, and DENNSV in all human tissues examined. Expression
of KIAA0358, IG20FL, and IG20SV4 was not observed.

GENE FUNCTION

Schievella et al. (1997) found that the MADD protein associated with
TNFR1 through a death domain-death domain interaction. Overexpression of
MADD activated the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK2 (176948),
and expression of the MADD death domain stimulated both the ERK2 and
JNK1 (601158) MAP kinases and induced the phosphorylation of cytosolic
phospholipase A2 (600522). The authors suggested that MADD links TNFR1
with MAP kinase activation and arachidonic acid release.

Al-Zoubi et al. (2001) showed that HeLa cells permanently transfected
with IG20 or DENNSV were more susceptible or resistant to TNF-alpha
(TNFA; 191160)-induced apoptosis, respectively. All MADD variants tested
could interact with TNFR1 and activate ERK and NF-kappa-B (see 164011).
However, relative to control cells, only those expressing IG20 showed
enhanced TNF-alpha-induced activation of caspase-8 (CASP8; 601763) and
CASP3 (600636). Cowpox virus CrmA, an inhibitor of caspase-induced
apoptosis, inhibited apoptosis when transfected in IG20-expressing HeLa
cells.

Using specific small hairpin RNAs targeted to splice variants of the
MADD gene, Mulherkar et al. (2006) found that knockdown of the MADD
variant resulted in spontaneous apoptosis in HeLa cells and in a human
ovarian carcinoma cell line, and they demonstrated that the MADD variant
alone was necessary and sufficient for cancer cell survival. Mulherkar
et al. (2006) hypothesized that since the MADD variant can bind to death
receptors, it may prevent apoptotic signaling by interfering with death
receptor oligomerization.

Efimova et al. (2004) found that overexpression of DENNSV enhanced cell
replication and resistance to treatment with proapoptotic stimuli. In
contrast, IG20 expression suppressed cell replication and increased
susceptibility to proapoptotic stimuli. Moreover, cells that were
resistant or susceptible to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis exclusively
expressed endogenous DENNSV and IG20, respectively. Transfection of IG20
in a DENNSV-expressing cell line overrode endogenous DENNSV function and
increased susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli. Dominant-negative
I-kappa-B (see NFKBIA; 164008) reversed the effects of DENNSV, but not
IG20, indicating that DENNSV functions through NF-kappa-B activation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chow et al. (1998) determined that the MADD gene spans at least 28 kb
and contains 15 exons, ranging in size from 73 to 1,230 bp.

Efimova et al. (2004) determined that the MADD gene contains 36 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the MADD gene
to chromosome 11. Using FISH, Chow et al. (1998) mapped the MADD gene to
chromosome 11p11.2.

108732	TITLE *108732 ATPase, Ca(2+)-TRANSPORTING, PLASMA MEMBRANE, 4; ATP2B4
;;PLASMA MEMBRANE Ca(2+)-ATPase, TYPE 4; PMCA4;;
ATP2B2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Ca(2+)-ATPases are a family of plasma membrane pumps encoded by at
least 4 genes: ATP2B1 (108731) on chromosome 12q21; ATP2B2 (108733) on
3q26; ATP2B3 (300014) on Xq28; and ATP2B4.

CLONING

By PCR, Brandt et al. (1992) detected expression of the PMCA4a variant
in all tissues examined. They identified a second variant, PMCA4b, that
was primarily expressed in skeletal muscle, small intestine, heart,
spinal cord, and brain. Brandt et al. (1992) isolated the full-length
PMCA4b cDNA from a fetal brain cDNA library. The deduced 473-amino acid
protein lacks a large portion of the C terminus found in PMCA4a.

By RT-PCR, Santiago-Garcia et al. (1996) found variable expression of
the PMCA and SERCA (see 108730) genes during human fetal heart
development. PMCA4 and PMCA1 were expressed in 8-, 12-, and 20-week
fetal heart and in adult heart. Two PMCA4 splice variants were detected
in heart tissue, whereas only 1 was detected in placenta.

Okunade et al. (2004) examined Pmca1 and Pmca4 expression in mouse
tissues. Pmca1 was expressed in all tissues examined, and Pmca4 was
expressed in all tissues examined except liver. Pmca1 predominated in
brain, intestine, kidney, lung, and stomach, whereas Pmca4 predominated
in aorta, portal vein, bladder, diaphragm, seminal vesicles, and testis.
Immunostaining localized Pmca4 to the principal piece of the sperm tail,
the location of Catsper (606389), the major Ca(2+) channel required for
sperm motility.

MAPPING

Olson et al. (1991) mapped the PMCA4 gene to chromosome 1q25-q32 by
Southern analysis of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids, in situ
hybridization of human metaphase spreads, and genetic linkage analysis
in the CEPH pedigrees. No evidence was obtained for multiple copies of
the gene at this locus; however, a cross-hybridizing sequence was
detected on Xq13-qter at low stringency.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Associations Pending Confirmation

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the ATP2B4
gene and resistance to severe malaria, see 611162.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chen et al. (2004) expressed mouse Cd22 (107266) in mouse and chicken
B-cell lines devoid of Cd22 and examined B cells from mice deficient in
Cd22 or Pmca4. They identified an activation-dependent interaction
between phosphorylated Cd22 and Pmca4 and found that Cd22 together with
Shp1 (PTPN6; 176883) provided negative control of B-cell activation by
enhancing Pmca4-mediated calcium efflux after B-cell receptor
stimulation.

Okunade et al. (2004) found that loss of both copies of the mouse Pmca4
gene resulted in no overt phenotype. Loss of Pmca4 impaired phasic
contractions and caused apoptosis in portal vein smooth muscle in vitro,
but this phenotype was dependent on the mouse strain employed. On a
Black Swiss background, the phenotype was not expressed unless the mice
also carried a null mutation in 1 copy of the Pmca1 gene. Pmca4 -/- male
mice were infertile but had normal spermatogenesis and mating behavior.
Pmca4 -/- sperm that had not undergone capacitation exhibited normal
motility but did not achieve hyperactivated motility needed to traverse
the female genital tract. Ultrastructure of the motility apparatus of
mutant sperm tails showed mitochondrial condensation, indicating Ca(2+)
overload. Okunade et al. (2004) concluded that PMCA4 expression in the
principal piece of sperm tail is essential for hyperactivated motility
and male fertility.

609405	TITLE *609405 RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 8; ARHGAP8
;;GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN, RHO, 8;;
BCH DOMAIN-CONTAINING, PROLINE-RICH, AND CDC42GAP-LIKE PROTEIN 1;
BPGAP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Small GTPases control cell dynamics during growth and development.
Proteins with a GTPase-activating domain (GAP) domain, such as ARHGAP8,
catalyze the conversion of small GTPases from their active, GTP-bound
form to their inactive, GDP-bound form (Lua and Low, 2004).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to CDC42GAP (ARHGAP1;
602732), followed by PCR of a mammary carcinoma cell line, Shang et al.
(2003) cloned a splice variant of ARHGAP8, which they designated BPGAP1.
The deduced 433-amino acid protein contains a BNIP2 (603292) and
CDC42GAP homology (BCH) domain, followed by a proline-rich region and a
C-terminal GAP domain with a conserved arginine necessary for catalytic
activity. Database analysis identified 3 possible splice variants
encoding BPGAP1-like proteins that differ in their N-terminal halves.
RT-PCR detected expression of BPGAP1 in all human cell lines and mouse
tissues tested.

Using a candidate gene approach to identify putative tumor suppressors
in a region of chromosome 22 involved in loss of heterozygosity,
Johnstone et al. (2004) identified the ARHGAP8 gene. They characterized
3 different ARHGAP8 transcripts resulting from alternative splicing of
exon 5. The variant containing exon 5 encodes a deduced 464-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 53.5 kD. This isoform
contains a putative N-terminal BCH lipid-binding domain, a central
proline-rich SH3 domain-binding motif, and a C-terminal RhoGAP domain
with a conserved catalytic arginine. The variant lacking exon 5 encodes
a protein with a 31-amino acids deletion in the BCH domain, and the
variant with a truncation of exon 5 encodes a protein with a 5-amino
acid deletion in the BCH domain. Northern blot analysis detected ARHGAP8
expression in colon, skeletal muscle, small intestine, stomach, and
testis, with highest expression in kidney and placenta. Johnstone et al.
(2004) also identified mouse Arhgap8. The mouse gene lacks an exon
equivalent to human exon 5 and encodes a 325-amino acid protein that
shares 80% identity with human ARHGAP8. Johnstone et al. (2004) noted
that a mouse gene reported as Arhgap8 by Shan et al. (2003) actually
represents a distinct gene, Prr5 (609406), located immediately
centromeric to Arhgap8.

GENE FUNCTION

Shang et al. (2003) found that BPGAP1 selectively enhanced RhoA (ARHA;
165390) GTPase activity in vitro, although it also interacted strongly
with CDC42 (116952) and RAC1 (602048). Pull-down and
coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that BPGAP1 formed homophilic and
heterophilic complexes with other BCH domain-containing proteins.
Epitope-tagged BPGAP1 induced pseudopodia and increased cell mobility in
a transfected breast cancer cell line. Formation of pseudopodia required
the BCH and GAP domains of BPGAP1, but not the proline-rich region.
BPGAP1-induced pseudopodia formation was differentially inhibited by
coexpression of a constitutively active RhoA mutant or by
dominant-negative mutants of CDC42 and RAC1. A BPGAP1 mutant without the
proline-rich region failed to increase cell migration despite the
induction of pseudopodia.

By protein precipitations and matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, Lua and Low (2004) found that
BPGAP1 interacted directly with cortactin (EMS1; 164765) in several
human cell lines. Progressive deletion studies indicated that the SH3
domain of cortactin interacted directly with the proline-rich motif at
amino acids 182 to 189 of BPGAP1. Cotransfection of human embryonic 293T
cells with cortactin and BPGAP1 resulted in colocalization of the 2
proteins at the cell periphery and enhanced cell migration. Substitution
of pro184 and pro186 in BPGAP1 with alanines abolished the interaction,
and mutant BPGAP1 failed to facilitate translocation of cortactin to the
periphery or enhance cell migration.

GENE STRUCTURE

Johnstone et al. (2004) determined that the ARHGAP8 gene contains 13
exons and spans 110 kb. Exon 1 is embedded in a CpG island.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Johnstone et al. (2004) mapped the ARHGAP8
gene to chromosome 22q13.31, immediately centromeric to the PRR5 gene.
They mapped the mouse Arhgap8 gene to chromosome 15E2, a region that
shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 22q13.

;;LEFT-RIGHT DETERMINATION, FACTOR B; LEFTY B;;
LEFTY1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF;;
LEFTB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Vertebrates exhibit numerous left-right (L-R) asymmetries, such as the
position of the heart and spleen on the left side. L-R polarity is
determined early during development, around the presomite stage in
mammals. Several genes have been shown to be expressed asymmetrically
relative to the L-R axis. Meno et al. (1996, 1997) identified 2
transforming growth factor-beta-related genes, Lefty1 and Lefty2
(601887), that are expressed on the left side of developing mouse
embryos. A human sequence corresponding to the mouse Lefty2 gene has
been deposited in the GenBank database (GENBANK AF081507).

Kosaki et al. (1999) characterized 2 homologs of the murine Lefty1 and
Lefty2 genes, which they designated LEFTY B and LEFTY A, respectively.
Both genes encode proteins with 366 amino acids. The deduced amino acid
sequences of LEFTY B and LEFTY A are more similar to each other than to
mouse Lefty1 or Lefty2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kosaki et al. (1999) determined that the LEFTY1 and LEFTY2 genes each
comprise 4 exons spliced at identical positions. The genes are separated
by approximately 50 kb on chromosome 1q42.

MAPPING

Kosaki et al. (1999) mapped the LEFTY1 and LEFTY2 genes to chromosome
1q42 by FISH.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For a discussion of LEFTY2 and the mutations identified in that gene in
cases of left-right axis malformations, see 601877.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lefty1, Lefty2, and Nodal (601265) are expressed on the left side of
developing mouse embryos and are implicated in L-R determination. Meno
et al. (1998) examined the role of Lefty1 by analyzing mutant mice
lacking this gene. The Lefty1-deficient mice showed a variety of L-R
positional defects in visceral organs. The most common feature of Lefty1
-/- mice was thoracic left isomerism (rather than right isomerism). The
lack of Lefty1 resulted in bilateral expression of Nodal, Lefty2, and
Pitx2 (601542), a homeobox gene normally expressed on the left side.
These observations suggested that the role of Lefty1 is to restrict the
expression of Lefty2 and Nodal to the left side, and that Lefty2 or
Nodal encode a signal for 'leftness.'

In mouse embryos, Takaoka et al. (2006) found that Lefty1 was
asymmetrically expressed in the primitive endoderm of the implanting
blastocyst. Lefty1 expression began randomly in the inner cell mass of
the blastocyst but became regionalized to one side of the tilted inner
cell mass shortly after implantation. Asymmetric Lefty1 expression was
established by in vitro culture, indicating that it does not require
interaction with the uterus. Asymmetric Lefty1 expression was induced by
Nodal signaling, although Nodal and genes for its effectors were
expressed symmetrically. Takaoka et al. (2006) concluded that asymmetric
patterning of the mouse embryo along the anteroposterior axis begins in
the periimplantation stage.

Reaction-diffusion models postulated that differences in signaling range
are caused by differential diffusivity of inhibitor and activator. Other
models suggested that differential clearance underlies different
signaling ranges. To test these models, Muller et al. (2012) measured
the biophysical properties of the Nodal/Lefty activator/inhibitor system
during zebrafish embryogenesis. Analysis of Nodal and Lefty gradients
revealed that Nodals have a shorter range than Lefty proteins.
Pulse-labeling analysis indicated that Nodals and Leftys have similar
clearance kinetics, whereas fluorescence recovery assays revealed that
Leftys have a higher effective diffusion coefficient than Nodals. Muller
et al. (2012) concluded that their results indicated that differential
diffusivity is the major determinant of the differences in Nodal/Lefty
range and provided biophysical support for reaction-diffusion models of
activator/inhibitor-mediated patterning.

191340	TITLE *191340 UBIQUITIN C; UBC
;;POLYUBIQUITIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Studies of ubiquitin cDNAs and genes show 2 unusual gene structural
arrangements (Schlesinger and Bond, 1987). The first type of arrangement
is the polyubiquitin gene, consisting of tandem repeats of a ubiquitin
coding unit, with the number of repeats varying considerably even within
species. Presumably posttranslational cleavage produces ubiquitin
monomers from the primary translation product. The second structural
type is the ubiquitin fusion gene, which encodes a single ubiquitin
moiety fused to an unrelated tail protein. Three types of ubiquitin have
been identified: A, B (191339), and C. The ubiquitin C (UBC) mRNA
corresponds to a 9-coding-unit polyubiquitin gene.

MAPPING

During Northern blot analysis of ubiquitin mRNA, Baker and Board (1989)
observed a UBC mRNA length polymorphism. They characterized this 'mRLP',
showed that it correlated precisely with an HaeIII RFLP, and explained
the origin of the polymorphism on the basis of unequal crossover events.
Using a 5-prime flanking fragment to probe Southern blots of DNA
obtained from somatic cell hybrid cell lines, Board et al. (1992)
determined that the UBC gene is located on chromosome 12. In situ
hybridization with the same probe refined the assignment to 12q24.3.

602327	TITLE *602327 PLECKSTRIN AND SEC7 DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN; PSD
;;TYL;;
EXCHANGE FACTOR FOR ARF6; EFA6;;
EFA6A
DESCRIPTION Perletti et al. (1997) identified a novel human gene on 10q24,
contiguous to the 3-prime end of the NFKB2 gene (164012) in a
tail-to-tail arrangement. They described a cDNA of 4,307 bp, isolated
from an adult human brain cDNA library, which contains an open reading
frame encoding a putative protein of 645 amino acids with a predicted
molecular weight of 71 kD. Database homology searches indicated that the
novel gene codes for a putative protein containing 2 discrete domains
with significant homology to the Sec7 and pleckstrin-homology (PH)
domains, respectively. They used the gene symbol PSD for
'pleckstrin-Sec7 domains.' Northern blot analysis of a panel of RNAs
from normal human tissues using the PSD cDNA as probe revealed the
presence of 3 different tissue-specific transcripts of approximately
4.3, 2.3, and 1.8 kb, the longest of which was expressed only in brain.
The data suggested that the PSD gene may encode a protein related to the
protein family containing both the Sec7 in the PH domains and thought to
be involved in signaling transduction processes. Other human proteins in
the same family include cytohesin-1 (Kolanus et al., 1996) and ARNO
(602488) (Chardin et al., 1996).

Derrien et al. (2002) reported that PSD, which they called EFA6A, is 63%
identical to EFA6B (PSD4; 614442) and contains a Sec7 domain adjacent to
a PH domain, followed by a C-terminal coiled-coil motif. Northern blot
analysis showed that EFA6A expression was largely restricted to brain,
with a smaller transcript expressed in small intestine, colon, and
ovary. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated punctate cell surface
expression of ARF6 (600464) and EFA6A, like EFA6B, in transfected baby
hamster kidney cells. Both EFA6 proteins also colocalized with F-actin
(see 102610).

GENE FUNCTION

Derrien et al. (2002) found that recombinant EFA6A stimulated nucleotide
exchange on myristoylated ARF6, with only low activity on ARF1 (103180).
The C-terminal region was involved in microvilli lengthening. Derrien et
al. (2002) concluded that EFA6 family guanine exchange factors are
modular proteins that work through the coordinated action of the
catalytic Sec7 domain to promote ARF6 activation, through the PH domain
to regulate association with specific subdomains of the plasma membrane,
and through the C-terminal region to control actin cytoskeletal
reorganization.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the PSD gene to chromosome 10q24.32 based on an
alignment of the PSD sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC142689) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heterotrimeric G proteins transduce extracellular signals received by
cell surface receptors into integrated cellular responses. GPSM2 belongs
to a group of proteins that modulate activation of G proteins (Blumer et
al., 2002).

CLONING

Using GNAI2 (139360) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a B-cell cDNA
library, followed by screening a HeLa cell cDNA library, Mochizuki et
al. (1996) cloned full-length GPSM2, which they designated LGN due to
the presence of 10 leu-gly-asn repeats in the protein. The deduced
677-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 76 kD. The
N-terminal half of LGN contains the leu-gly-asn repeats, which are
located within 7 repeats of about 40 amino acids that form alpha helices
interrupted by turns. The C-terminal half of LGN contains 4 GoLoco
motifs (G-alpha-i/o-Loco), which are involved in guanine nucleotide
exchange. LGN also has several potential protein kinase phosphorylation
sites. RT-PCR detected LGN expression in all tissues examined.

Blumer et al. (2002) determined that human LGN shares 59% amino acid
identity with rat activator of G protein signaling-3 (AGS3, or GPSM1;
609491), with most similarity in the 7 N-terminal tetratricopeptide
repeat (TPR) motifs and the 4 C-terminal G protein regulatory motifs.
Western blot analysis detected Lgn in all rat tissues and specific brain
regions examined. Lgn was expressed in all cell lines tested and in
primary cultures of rat cortical neurons, astroglia, and microglia. In
primary neuronal cultures, Lgn was nonhomogeneously distributed in the
cell body, neuronal processes, and nucleus.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Blumer et al. (2002) mapped the GPSM2 gene
to chromosome 1p13.1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Blumer et al. (2002) determined that the GPSM2 gene contains 14 exons
and spans about 44.7 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Blumer et al. (2002) found that activation of NMDA receptors (see
138252) and elevated intracellular calcium in primary rat neuronal
cultures caused redistribution of Lgn into punctate structures in the
cell body and neuronal processes. Distribution of Lgn was dynamic in
actively dividing rat pheochromocytoma cells and COS-7 cells. During the
cell cycle, Lgn relocalized from the nucleus to the midbody, where it
colocalized with F-actin at the site of daughter cell separation during
cytokinesis.

Nair et al. (2005) investigated the presence of a guanosine diphosphate
(GDP) dissociation inhibitor (GDI) for transducin (139330) in rod
photoreceptor cells. Western blot analysis showed Lgn (but not Ags3 or
Ags1) in mouse and bovine retina. By immunofluorescence microscopy of
mouse retinal sections, Lgn was localized mostly in the inner segments
and outer plexiform layer of photoreceptor cells in both light and dark
conditions. Lgn was present in the cytosol, membrane, and the
detergent-resistant cytoskeletal fraction. The ratio of Lgn to
transducin was at least 1:15. The alpha subunit of transducin in its
GDP-bound state interacted with endogenous and recombinant Lgn, and the
recombinant G protein regulatory motif of Lgn reduced the rate of
guanosine triphosphate (GTP) exchange. Nair et al. (2005) concluded that
photoreceptor inner segments contain Lgn, which can bind to the alpha
subunit of transducin and potentially regulate its function.

Walsh et al. (2010) evaluated inner ear expression of Gpsm2 in mice
using immunohistochemistry. There was embryonic and perinatal expression
of Gpsm2 at the apical surfaces of the hair and supporting cells in the
cochlea, utricle, saccule, and cristae. In the cochlea, Gpsm2
localization extended throughout the greater epithelial ridge. At
postnatal day (P) 0, cochlear hair cells showed asymmetric localization
of Gpsm2 at the lateral edge, a pattern that was not present in hair
cells at embryonic day (E) 16.5. Gpsm2 also localized in pillar cells in
P0 inner ears. By P15, Gpsm2 had disappeared at the apical surface of
the cells but persisted in pillar cells. In adult mice, Gpsm2 was
concentrated specifically in the head region of the inner pillar cells.
RT-PCR studies showed that Gpsm2 expression decreased rapidly between
E16.5 and P30, dropping to a level in adult mice that was approximately
20% of that at E16.5, indicating developmental regulation.

Using in vivo skin-specific lentiviral RNA interference, Williams et al.
(2011) investigated spindle orientation regulation and provided direct
evidence that LGN, NuMA (164009), and dynactin (DCTN1; 601143) are
involved. In compromising asymmetric cell divisions, Williams et al.
(2011) uncovered profound defects in stratification, differentiation,
and barrier formation, and implicate Notch (190198) signaling as an
important effector. Williams et al. (2011) concluded that asymmetric
cell division components act by reorienting mitotic spindles to achieve
perpendicular divisions, which in turn promote stratification and
differentiation. Furthermore, the resemblance between their knockdown
phenotypes and Rbpj (147183) loss-of-function mutants provided important
clues that suprabasal Notch signaling is impaired when asymmetric cell
divisions do not occur.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a Palestinian kindred with Chudley-McCullough
syndrome (CMCS; 604213), Walsh et al. (2010) identified a homozygous
mutation in the GPSM2 gene (R127X; 609245.0001). All unaffected parents
were heterozygous for the mutation. The findings indicated that GPSM2 is
essential to the development of normal hearing, and Walsh et al. (2010)
postulated that the R127X mutation caused a defect in the maintenance of
cell polarity and spindle orientation in hair and supporting cells of
the developing inner ear. By homozygosity mapping followed by candidate
gene analysis, Yariz et al. (2012) identified a homozygous truncating
mutation in the GPSM2 gene (Q562X; 609245.0002) in affected members of a
consanguineous Turkish family with CMCS. Although the families reported
by Walsh et al. (2010) and Yariz et al. (2012) were originally reported
to have autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness 82 (DFNB82),
neuroimaging studies by Doherty et al. (2012) found abnormalities,
including short, thin corpus callosum, heterotopia, frontal
polymicrogyria, cerebellar dysplasia, and an arachnoid cyst, consistent
with a diagnosis of Chudley-McCullough syndrome.

By homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing of patients with
Chudley-McCullough syndrome, Doherty et al. (2012) identified homozygous
or compound heterozygous mutations in the GPSM2 gene
(609245.0003-609245.0006). The disorder was characterized by severe to
profound deafness and characteristic brain abnormalities on
neuroimaging, including ventriculomegaly, partial agenesis of the corpus
callosum, heterotopia, frontal polymicrogyria, cerebellar dysplasia, and
arachnoid cysts. Despite these abnormalities, neurodevelopment was
essential normal, except in 1 child who had mild to moderate
intellectual disability. Only 2 patients had seizures, which were well
controlled. There were no apparent genotype/phenotype correlations.
Doherty et al. (2012) postulated that the disorder results from
asymmetric cell divisions in the brain during development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lee et al. (2006) tested whether cell polarity genes, known to regulate
embryonic neuroblast asymmetric cell division, also regulate neuroblast
self-renewal. Clonal analysis in Drosophila larval brains showed that
pins mutant neuroblasts rapidly fail to self-renew, whereas lgl (600966)
mutant neuroblasts generate multiple neuroblasts. Notably, lgl pins
double-mutant neuroblasts all divide symmetrically to self-renew,
filling the brain with neuroblasts at the expense of neurons. The lgl
pins neuroblasts show ectopic cortical localization of atypical protein
kinase C (aPKC; see 176960), and a decrease in aPKC expression reduces
neuroblast numbers, suggesting that aPKC promotes neuroblast
self-renewal. In support of this hypothesis, Lee et al. (2006) found
that neuroblast-specific overexpression of membrane-targeted aPKC, but
not a kinase-dead version, induced ectopic neuroblast self-renewal. Lee
et al. (2006) concluded that cortical aPKC kinase activity is a potent
inducer of neuroblast self-renewal.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHUDLEY-MCCULLOUGH SYNDROME
GPSM2, ARG127TER

In 7 members of a consanguineous Palestinian kindred with
Chudley-McCullough syndrome (CMCS; 604213), Walsh et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 875C-T transition in the GPSM2 gene, resulting
in an arg127-to-ter (R127X) substitution that truncated the protein
between the second and third TPR motifs. Analysis of lymphoblast RNA
showed that the nonsense allele produced a stable mutant transcript. All
unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation. Walsh et al.
(2010) postulated a defect in the maintenance of cell polarity and
spindle orientation in hair and supporting cells of the developing inner
ear. Although the family was originally reported to have autosomal
recessive nonsyndromic deafness 82 (DFNB82), neuroimaging of 1 patient
by Doherty et al. (2012) found abnormalities, including short, thin
corpus callosum, heterotopia, frontal polymicrogyria, cerebellar
dysplasia, and an arachnoid cyst, consistent with a diagnosis of
Chudley-McCullough syndrome.

.0002
CHUDLEY-MCCULLOUGH SYNDROME
GPSM2, GLN562TER

In 3 affected members of a consanguineous Turkish kindred with CMCS
(604213), Yariz et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 1684C-T transition
in exon 15 of the GPSM2 gene, resulting in a gln562-to-ter (Q562X)
substitution in the second GoLoco motif repeat in the C terminus. The
mutation was predicted to interfere with the association of GPSM2 with
G-alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. Analysis of lymphoblast
RNA showed that the mutant transcript was stable. All unaffected parents
were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 173 controls.
The mutation was identified by homozygosity mapping followed by
candidate gene analysis. Yariz et al. (2012) suggested that the hearing
loss was related to inadequate cell polarity relating to defective
spindle orientation, resulting in impaired hair cell transduction in the
inner ear. Although the family was originally reported to have autosomal
recessive nonsyndromic deafness 82 (DFNB82), neuroimaging of all 3
patients by Doherty et al. (2012) found abnormalities, including short,
thin corpus callosum, heterotopia, frontal polymicrogyria, arachnoid
cysts, and variable cerebellar dysplasia, consistent with a diagnosis of
Chudley-McCullough syndrome.

.0003
CHUDLEY-MCCULLOUGH SYNDROME
GPSM2, 1-BP DEL, 1473G

In 5 individuals from 4 Mennonite families with Chudley-McCullough
syndrome (CMCS; 604213), Doherty et al. (2012) identified a homozygous
1-bp deletion (1473delG) in the GPSM2 gene, predicted to result in a
frameshift and premature termination (Gly491GlyfsTer6). These
individuals shared a common disease haplotype, consistent with a founder
effect. The mutations were identified by whole-exome sequencing and
confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

.0004
CHUDLEY-MCCULLOUGH SYNDROME
GPSM2, 1-BP DEL, 741C

In 2 Mennonite sibs and an unrelated European American patient, all with
Chudley-McCullough syndrome (604213), Doherty et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous 1-bp deletion (742delC) in the GPSM2 gene, predicted to cause
a frameshift and premature termination (Asn247AsnfsTer34). Affected sibs
of Dutch ancestry with the disorder were compound heterozygous for
741delC and a premature termination mutation (S554X; 609245.0005).

.0005
CHUDLEY-MCCULLOUGH SYNDROME
GPSM2, SER554TER (dbSNP rs145191476)

In sibs of Dutch ancestry with Chudley-McCullough syndrome (604213),
Doherty et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for a 1-bp
deletion in the GPSM2 gene (609245.0004) on the paternal allele and a
1661C-A transversion, resulting in a ser554-to-ter (S554X) substitution,
on the maternal allele. This variant, which was found in the
heterozygous state in 1 of 3,510 subjects in the Exome Sequencing
Project, was designated dbSNP rs145191476.

.0006
CHUDLEY-MCCULLOUGH SYNDROME
GPSM2, IVS9DS, G-T, +1

In 2 Mexican American sibs with Chudley-McCullough syndrome (604213),
Doherty et al. (2012) identified a homozygous G-to-T transversion in the
donor splice site of exon 9 of the GPSM2 gene. The mutation caused a
transcript missing exon 9 and was predicted to result in a truncated
protein (R318RfsX8). The mutation was not found in 3,510 European
American individuals.

611194	TITLE *611194 RUN AND FYVE DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN 3; RUFY3
;;SINGLE AXON-RELATED 1; SINGAR1;;
RAP2-INTERACTING PROTEIN X; RIPX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomly sequencing clones from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) obtained a cDNA encoding RUFY3, which they
called KIAA0871, encoding a deduced 469-amino acid protein.

Using 2-dimensional electrophoresis analysis of proteins in stage 2 and
stage 3 hippocampal neurons, Mori et al. (2007) identified RUFY3, which
they called single axon-related-1 (singar1), in human, mouse, and rat.
The deduced proteins in all 3 species have 469 amino acids and contain a
RUN domain. The mouse and rat proteins contain a splice variant,
designated singar2, of 487 amino acids. Expression of singar1 in rat
brain was relatively low on embryonic day 15, peaked around postnatal
day 4, and decreased in the adult brain. Immunocytochemical analysis
showed that rat singar1 and singar2 accumulate in growth cones of minor
processes and axons.

GENE FUNCTION

Mori et al. (2007) found that rat singar1 became upregulated during
polarization of cultured hippocampal neurons and remained at high levels
thereafter. Reduction of singar1 expression by RNAi led to an increase
in the population of neurons bearing surplus axons. Overexpression of
singar1 suppressed the formation of surplus axons induced by excess
amounts of shootin1 (611171), without affecting normal polarization
processes.

MAPPING

Scott (2007) mapped the RUFY3 gene to chromosome 4q13.3 based on an
alignment of the RUFY3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB020678) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

120250	TITLE *120250 COLLAGEN, TYPE VI, ALPHA-3; COL6A3
DESCRIPTION The COL6A3 gene encodes the alpha-3 chain of type VI collagen. See also
COL6A1 (120220).

CLONING

Chu et al. (1990) isolated and sequenced human cDNA clones corresponding
to the COL6A3 gene.

Klewer et al. (1998) studied COL6A3 gene expression in the developing
mammalian heart. The pattern of expression was identical to that of
COL6A1.

By microarray analysis, Jun et al. (2001) demonstrated expression of the
COL6A3 gene in human donor corneas.

GENE STRUCTURE

Stokes et al. (1991) reported information on the exons for part of the
COL6A3 gene.

MAPPING

Weil et al. (1987, 1988) localized the COL6A3 gene to chromosome 2q37 by
Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ
hybridization. At least 3 other extracellular matrix genes are also
located on 2q: 2 collagen genes, COL3A1 (120180) and COL5A2 (120190),
and the fibronectin gene (135600).

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Speer et al. (1996) localized
the COL6A3 gene to chromosome 2q37 within a 17-cM region spanned by
D2S336 and D2S395. By linkage analysis, they mapped a candidate gene for
Bethlem myopathy (158810) to the same chromosomal region.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pan et al. (1998) identified a mutation in the COL6A3 gene (120250.0001)
in affected members of a large American pedigree with Bethlem myopathy
(158810), a rare autosomal dominant proximal myopathy characterized by
early childhood onset and joint contractures.

Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD; 254090) is an autosomal
recessive disorder characterized by generalized muscular weakness,
contractures of multiple joints, and distal hyperextensibility. Demir et
al. (2002) demonstrated linkage of UCMD to 2q37 in 3 families, each of
which demonstrated homozygous mutation in the COL6A3 gene (see, e.g.,
120250.0002 and 120250.0003). One family had a phenotype of intermediate
severity, a second an unusually mild phenotype, and a third with a
severe phenotype as previously described in patients with UCMD. This was
the first description of mutations in COL6A3 in UCMD; previously
mutations had been described in COL6A2 (120240).

Lampe et al. (2005) developed a method for rapid direct sequence
analysis of all 107 coding exons of the COL6 genes (COL6A1, COL6A2,
COL6A3) using single condition amplification/internal primer (SCAIP)
sequencing. They sequenced all 3 COL6 genes from genomic DNA in 79
patients with UCMD or Bethlem myopathy, and found putative mutations in
1 of the COL6 genes in 62% of patients. Some patients showed changes in
more than one of the COL6 genes, and some UCMD patients appeared to have
dominant rather than recessive disease. Lampe et al. (2005) concluded
that these findings may explain some or all of the cases of UCMD that
are unlinked to the COL6 genes under a recessive model.

In 2 unrelated patients with Bethlem myopathy, Baker et al. (2007)
identified 2 different heterozygous mutations in the COL6A3 gene
(120250.0005; 120250.0006).

Nadeau et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous COL6A3 mutation
(120250.0004) in 2 unrelated individuals with autosomal dominant UCMD.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BETHLEM MYOPATHY
COL6A3, GLY1679GLU

In affected members of a large American kindred with Bethlem myopathy
(158810) linked to chromosome 2, Pan et al. (1998) identified a
heterozygous G-to-A transition in the COL6A3 gene, resulting in a
gly1679-to-glu (G1679E) substitution in the N-terminal globular domain
of the protein, rather than in the triple-helical domain where mutations
had been found in the COL6A1 (120220) and COL6A2 (120240) genes. The
mutation occurred in the N2 subdomain, 1 of the von Willebrand factor
type A domains of the COL6A3 gene.

.0002
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A3, IVS29, A-G, +5

In 3 sibs, a brother and 2 sisters, with consanguineous parents
originating from Morocco, Demir et al. (2002) identified homozygosity
for a splice donor site mutation in intron 29 (6930+5A-G) as the cause
of autosomal recessive Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (254090).
The phenotype was of intermediate severity. The mutation caused skipping
of exon 29 and partial reduction of collagen VI in muscle biopsy.
Neonatal hypotonia, severe in most cases, was found in all 5 cases in
the 3 families reported by Demir et al. (2002). In this family the 2
eldest sibs were never able to walk without support (calipers or walking
frame). Generalized muscle weakness, associated with predominantly
distal amyotrophy, became evident in the first years of life. Axial
muscles (mainly neck flexors), pelvic girdle muscles, and intrinsic
muscles in hands and feet were the most severely affected ones. Lower
limbs tended to be more severely affected than upper limbs; in most
cases, hip extensors and abductors were weaker than hip flexors, leading
to hip contractures that interfered with standing position. No
significant facial weakness was observed. CK levels were normal or
moderately raised (up to 4 times the normal values).

.0003
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A3, ARG465TER

In a girl of Italian extraction with unusually mild Ullrich congenital
muscular dystrophy (254090), Demir et al. (2002) found a homozygous
nonsense mutation in exon 5 of the COL6A3 gene: arg465 to ter (R465X).
Analysis of the patient's COL6A3 transcript showed the presence of
various mRNA species, one of which lacks several exons, including the
exon containing the nonsense mutation. The patient in this case was
still ambulant at age 18 and showed an unusual combination of
hyperlaxity and finger contractures (see Fig. 2). When the wrist was
extended, the retraction of finger flexor muscles impeded complete
finger extension, causing flexion contractures of fingers, which is
regarded as a characteristic 'Bethlem' sign. When the wrist was not
extended, the finger laxity became evident. The patient was able to
overlap, cross, or extend fingers beyond the normal range of motion
('Ullrich sign').

.0004
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
COL6A3, IVS16DS, G-A, +1

In a patient with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (254090), Baker
et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for a de novo splice site
mutation (IVS16DS+1G-A) in intron 16 of the COL6A3 gene. The mutation
was predicted to result in loss of exon 16, which encodes amino acids 13
to 33 of the triple helical region of COL6A3.

Nadeau et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous IVS16DS+1G-A mutation in
2 unrelated patients with UCMD. The first patient was a 30-year-old
individual who had onset at birth with hypotonia, congenital hip
dislocation, delayed motor development, and feeding difficulties.
Independent walking was not achieved, and the patient became
wheelchair-bound at age 12 years. There was spinal rigidity, scoliosis,
and kyphosis, as well as follicular hyperkeratosis, keloid formation,
and need for nocturnal ventilation. The second patient had onset at age
1.5 years but never achieved independent walking and was
wheelchair-bound by age 3.5 years. This patient died at age 10 years
during a respiratory illness.

BETHLEM MYOPATHY
COL6A3, IVS15DS, GT-TC, +1

In a 40-year-old Australian man with Bethlem myopathy (158810), Baker et
al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 2-bp change (GT-to-TC) in intron 15
of the COL6A3 gene, resulting in the skipping of exon 16, which encodes
the cysteine-rich linker region and the most N-terminal 15 amino acids
of the triple helix. Further studies showed that the mutation also
resulted in a premature stop codon and nonsense-mediated decay. There
was decreased collagen VI in the extracellular matrix, indicating
impaired microfibril formation. The patient had delayed motor
development, diffuse muscle weakness, decreased motor capacity,
kyphosis, and dystrophic features on muscle biopsy.

.0006
BETHLEM MYOPATHY
COL6A3, LEU1726ARG

In a 20-year-old man with Bethlem myopathy (158810), Baker et al. (2007)
identified a heterozygous 5177T-G transversion in a highly conserved
residue in exon 11 of the COL6A3 gene, resulting in a leu1726-to-arg
(L1726R) substitution in the globular N2 A domain. The patient had
reduced motor capacity, proximal muscle weakness, joint contractures,
and dystrophic findings on muscle biopsy. Further studies showed normal
levels of collagen VI in the extracellular matrix, indicating that the
mutant protein was able to fold and incorporate into collagen VI.

;;FRUCTOSE-1,6-BISPHOSPHATE ALDOLASE A;;
ALDOLASE A; ALDA;;
ALDOLASE 1;;
FRUCTOALDOLASE A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13) is a glycolytic enzyme
that catalyzes the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The enzyme is
a tetramer of identical 40-kD subunits. Vertebrates have 3 aldolase
isozymes, aldolases A, B (ALDOB; 612724), and C (ALDOC; 103870), which
are distinguished by their electrophoretic and catalytic properties. The
sequence of the aldolases around the active-site lysine is highly
conserved in evolution. Mammalian tissues express aldolase isozymes in a
well-characterized pattern. Developing embryo produces aldolase A, which
continues to be expressed in many adult tissues, sometimes at much
higher levels than in embryo. In adult muscle, aldolase A can be as much
as 5% of total cellular protein. In adult liver, kidney, and intestine,
aldolase A expression is repressed and aldolase B is produced. In brain
and other nervous tissue, aldolase A and C are expressed about equally.
In transformed liver cells, aldolase A replaces aldolase B (Rottmann et
al., 1984).

CLONING

Electrophoretic variants of fructoaldolase were reported by Charlesworth
(1972).

Sakakibara et al. (1985) cloned aldolase A from a human liver cDNA
library. The deduced protein contains 363 amino acids. RNA blot analysis
revealed a 1.6-kb ALDOA mRNA in skeletal muscle and a 1.7-kb ALDOA mRNA
in liver and placenta.

Freemont et al. (1988) presented the complete amino acid sequence of
human skeletal muscle fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, comprising 363
residues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Izzo et al. (1988) found that the ALDOA gene spans 7.5 kb and contains
12 exons. It occurs as a single copy per haploid human genome. Eight
exons containing the coding sequence were common to all mRNAs extracted
from several mammalian sources. Four additional exons were identified in
the 5-prime UTR: the first was contained in the ubiquitous mRNA, the
second in the muscle-specific mRNA, and the third and fourth in a minor
mRNA in human liver. S(1)-nuclease-protection analysis of the 5-prime
end of mRNA from cultured fibroblasts, muscle, and hepatoma cell lines
revealed 4 different transcription initiation sites. The presence of
conventional sequences for 4 eukaryotic promoters was also demonstrated.
The nucleotide similarities in the coding region and the intron-exon
organization of aldolases A, B, and C confirmed that they arose from a
common ancestral gene, with aldolase B diverging first.

MAPPING

Harris (1974) concluded that 3 loci determine aldolase. Cohen-Haguenauer
et al. (1985) assigned aldolase A to chromosome 16, whereas Kukita et
al. (1985) assigned it to chromosome 22. However, Kukita et al. (1987)
mapped the ALDOA gene to chromosome 16 by 3 different methods: molecular
hybridization to hybrid cell DNA, molecular hybridization to DNA of
sorted metaphase chromosomes, and in situ hybridization. In situ
hybridization indicated that the gene is located on the chromosome
16q22-q24 band. Serero et al. (1988) also assigned the aldolase A gene
to chromosome 16 by Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA with a
cDNA probe. Aldolase A pseudogenes were found on chromosomes 3 and 10.
The map location of the 3 aldolase genes and the aldolase pseudogene
(see 612724) is of considerable interest from the point of view of
chromosome evolution. The 4 genes are found on 2 pairs of
morphologically similar chromosomes, 9 and 10, and 16 and 17. These
homeologous (i.e., of similar origin) chromosome pairs may have arisen
from 1 or 2 tetraploidization events (Comings, 1972; Ohno, 1973). As
predicted by the chromosomal locations, the coding sequences of the
expressed aldolase A and C genes on chromosomes 16 and 17, respectively,
are more homologous to each other than either of them is to the
expressed aldolase B gene on chromosome 9.

Amberger (2008) mapped the ALDOA gene to chromosome 16p11.2 based on an
alignment of the ALDOA sequence (GenBank GENBANK M11560) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kishi et al. (1987) studied a patient with red cell aldolase deficiency,
or glycogen storage disease XII (GSD12; 611881), and identified a
mutation in the ALDOA gene that resulted in an asp128-to-gly (D128G;
103850.0001) substitution in the protein. The patient's enzyme from red
cells and from cultured lymphoblastoid cells was highly thermolabile,
and the enzyme expressed in E. coli was likewise thermolabile. The
parents had intermediate levels of red cell aldolase A. Southern blot
analysis of genomic DNA showed that the patient was homozygous for a
mutation that was heterozygous in both parents.

In a boy with aldolase A deficiency, Kreuder et al. (1996) identified a
homozygous germline mutation in the ALDOA gene that resulted
substitution of a negatively charged glutamic acid with a positively
charged lysine at the highly conserved residue 206 (E206L; 103850.0002).
The affected residue is highly conserved within the subunit interface
region.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE XII
ALDOA, ASP128GLY

In a patient with red cell aldolase deficiency, or glycogen storage
disease XII (GSD12; 611881), Kishi et al. (1987) identified an A-G
transversion at nucleotide 386 in the codon for the 128th amino acid,
leading to a change from aspartic acid (GAU) to glycine (GGU) (D128G) in
the aldolase protein. The patient's enzyme from red cells and from
cultured lymphoblastoid cells was highly thermolabile, and the enzyme
expressed in E. coli was likewise thermolabile. Since asp128 is
conserved in aldolase A, B (612724), and C (103870) of eukaryotes,
including Drosophila, this residue likely has a crucial role in
maintaining the correct spatial structure or in performing the catalytic
function of the enzyme. The parents had intermediate levels of red cell
aldolase A. The change in the aspartic acid codon extinguished an Fok1
restriction site (GGATG to GGGTG). Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA
showed that the patient was homozygous for a mutation that was
heterozygous in both parents.

.0002
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE XII
ALDOA, GLU206LYS

Kreuder et al. (1996) described a 4 1/2-year-old boy with predominantly
myopathic symptoms of aldolase A deficiency (611881) due to substitution
of a single amino acid within the subunit interface most essential for
the tetrameric structure of the enzyme. The patient showed muscle
weakness and premature muscle fatigue. He was unable to walk for more
than 10 minutes or climb more than 20 steps at a time. Several
unexplained episodes of jaundice and anemia required blood transfusions
during the first year of life. The parents were healthy and
nonconsanguineous. The patient showed slight jaundice, diminished muscle
mass, reduced muscle tone, and proximal muscle weakness. The liver and
spleen were somewhat enlarged. Creatine kinase was markedly elevated in
the blood of this patient, and several muscle enzymes, as well as serum
bilirubin, were increased. Codon 206 of the ALDOA gene was found to have
a homozygous transition from GAG (glu) to AAG (lys) (E206K). The authors
noted that a glutamate is present in all human aldolases at position 206
of the enzyme. Both parents and a healthy brother were heterozygous for
the mutation.

;;SMALL INDUCIBLE CYTOKINE SUBFAMILY A, MEMBER 8; SCYA8;;
MONOCYTE CHEMOTACTIC PROTEIN 2; MCP2
DESCRIPTION Chemokines, a family of small cytokines, attract leukocytes and possess
various immunomodulating functions. The C-C chemokines, which Van
Coillie et al. (1997) stated to be located on 17q11.2, influence
mononuclear cell types. Van Damme et al. (1992) isolated MCP2 from
stimulated osteosarcoma cells, determined its nearly complete amino acid
sequence, and identified it as a monocyte chemotactic factor based on a
pattern of conserved cysteine residues. By degenerate PCR with primers
based on C-C chemokine consensus sequences, Van Coillie et al. (1997)
isolated the MCP2 gene from a YAC contig from human chromosome 17q11.2.
Van Coillie et al. (1997) stated that the MCP2 gene contains 3 exons in
a span of about 3 kb and encodes a predicted 109-amino acid protein. The
mature MCP2 protein is approximately 75 amino acids long Van Damme et
al. (1992). Van Coillie et al. (1997) deduced that intron/exon structure
was conserved among MCP1 (158105), MCP2, and MCP3 (158106), and reported
that these genes share 77% coding nucleotide sequence homology. Van
Coillie et al. (1997) stated that the predicted protein sequence matches
the sequence of purified mature MCP2 reported by Van Damme et al. (1992)
with the exception of 1 lysine-to-glutamine change, which Van Coillie et
al. (1997) considered a polymorphism or cloning artifact. By Northern
blot analysis, Van Coillie et al. (1997) detected a major 1-kb
transcript in most tissues tested, with greatest expression in small
intestine and peripheral blood cells. Transcripts of 1.5 and 2.4 kb were
also observed.

;;p34;;

MCPIP4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZC3H12D is a CCCH-type zinc finger protein, like TTP (ZFP36; 190700),
ZAP (ZC3HAV1; 607312), and ROQUIN (RC3H1; 609424), whereas most
mammalian zinc finger proteins are CCHH- or CCCC-type proteins. Liang et
al. (2008) found that ZC3H12B, also known as MCPIP2, and other MCPIP
proteins, MCPIP1 (ZC3H12A; 610562), MCPIP2 (ZC3H12B; 300889), and MCPIP3
(ZC3H12C; 615001), regulate macrophage activation.

CLONING

Wang et al. (2007) reported frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on
chromosome 6q25.1 in sporadic lung tumors (211980) and determined a
2.2-Mb minimum region of LOH. By direct sequencing and SNP genotyping
using genomic DNAs from lung cancer pedigrees showing linkage to this
region, they identified a novel candidate gene, ZC3H12D, and identified
a nonsynonymous A/G SNP at codon 106 that changes a lysine to an
arginine. The deduced 321-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular
mass of 34 kD and contains a zinc finger CCCH (C-x8-C-x5-C-x3-H) motif.
The protein shares significant blocks of conservation with homologs in
other mammals and in lower organisms such as zebrafish and Drosophila.

By database searching for genes similar to MCPIP1, Liang et al. (2008)
identified MCPIP4, a 527-amino acid protein containing a single central
CCCH-type zinc finger and no other identifiable motifs. Mouse
macrophages treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but not Ifng
(147570), showed some induction of MCPIP4 by Northern blot analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2007) performed in vitro clonogenic and in vivo nude mouse
studies which showed that overexpression of the ZC3H12D 106A allele
exerts tumor suppressor function compared with the G allele.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wang et al. (2007) found that approximately 73% (8/11) of heterozygous
lung cancer tissues with LOH and the A/G SNP also exhibited loss of the
A allele. Wang et al. (2007) noted that the ZC3H12D gene was located
within a region containing a lung cancer susceptibility locus (608935),
but association studies of the A/G SNP demonstrated no association
between the less frequent 106G (arginine) allele and lung cancer
susceptibility in the families studied by Bailey-Wilson et al. (2004).

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang et al. (2007) determined that the ZC3H12D gene contains 6 coding
exons and 2 untranslated exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wang et al. (2007) mapped the ZC3H12D gene
to chromosome 6q25.1 (build 36.2).

611685	TITLE *611685 RING FINGER PROTEIN 8; RNF8
;;KIAA0646
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones from a size-fractionated brain cDNA library,
Ishikawa et al. (1998) cloned RNF8, which they designated KIAA0646. The
cDNA contains repetitive elements in its 3-prime end. The deduced
485-amino acid protein contains a C3HC4-type zinc finger signature,
suggesting that it is involved in nucleic acid management. RT-PCR
analysis detected moderate RNF8 expression in brain, testis, and ovary,
with little to no expression in all other tissues examined. In vitro
translation resulted in a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 62
kD by SDS-PAGE.

Using oligo capping, Seki et al. (1998) cloned RNF8 from a neuroblastoma
cDNA library. The deduced 485-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 56 kD. RT-PCR analysis detected variable expression in
all human tissues examined except spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis and protein pull-down assays, Takano et
al. (2004) showed that RNF8 and retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXRA; 180245)
interacted via their N-terminal regions. Overexpression of RNF8 in COS-7
cells resulted in interaction and colocalization of RNF8 and RXRA in the
nucleus. A point mutation in RNF8 that disrupted the RING finger or
deletion of the N-terminal region of RNF8 prevented localization of RNF8
to the nucleus without affecting nuclear localization of RXRA. Transient
overexpression of RNF8 enhanced RXRA-mediated transactivation of an
RXR-responsive element (RXRE) in a dose-dependent and retinoic
acid-independent manner and upregulated expression of genes downstream
of RXRE. Enhancement of transactivation was not seen with RNF8 carrying
the RING finger-disrupting mutation or the N-terminal deletion. Takano
et al. (2004) concluded that RNF8 is a regulator of RXRA-mediated
transcriptional activity.

Kolas et al. (2007) determined that the ubiquitin ligase RNF8 mediates
ubiquitin conjugation and 53BP1 (605230) and BRCA1 (113705) focal
accumulation at sites of DNA lesions. Moreover, Kolas et al. (2007)
established that MDC1 recruits RNF8 through phosphodependent
interactions between the RNF8 forkhead-associated domain and motifs in
MDC1 that are phosphorylated by the DNA damage-activated protein kinase
ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM; 607585). They showed that depletion
of the E2 enzyme UBC13 (603679) impairs 53BP1 recruitment to sites of
damage, which suggests that it cooperates with RNF8. RNF8 was also shown
to promote the G(2)/M DNA damage checkpoint and resistance to ionizing
radiation. Kolas et al. (2007) concluded that their results demonstrated
how the DNA damage response is orchestrated by ATM-dependent
phosphorylation of MDC1 and RNF8-mediated ubiquitination.

Yan et al. (2012) noted that RNF8 works with UBC13 to catalyze
lys63-linked polyubiquitination of H2A (see 613499)-type histones at
sites of DNA damage. They found that depletion of RNF8 in HeLa cells
abrogated the recruitment of FAAP20 (C1OR86; 615183) to sites of DNA
damage. Knockdown of either RNF8 or FAAP20 abrogated the recruitment of
FANCA (607139) and FANCD2 (613984) to sites of DNA damage.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the RNF8
gene to chromosome 6. Seki et al. (1998) mapped the RNF8 gene to
chromosome 6p21.3 by somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses.

ANIMAL MODEL

Santos et al. (2010) reported that Rnf8 -/- mice were defective in class
switch recombination (CSR) and accumulated immunoglobulin heavy chain
(IgH; see 147100)-associated double-strand breaks (DSB). The CSR DSB
repair defect was milder than that in 53bp1 -/- mice, but similar to
that in H2ax (601772) -/- mice. Like H2ax -/- mice, Rnf8 -/- males were
sterile, and this was associated with defective XY chromatin
ubiquitylation. Mice lacking both H2ax and Rnf8 did not have further
impairment of CSR. Although 53bp1 foci formation is Rnf8 dependent,
53bp1 could bind to chromatin in the absence of Rnf8. Santos et al.
(2010) proposed that there is a 2-step mechanism for 53BP1 association
with chromatin in which constitutive loading is dependent on
interactions with methylated histones, whereas DNA damage-inducible
RNF8-dependent ubiquitylation allows its accumulation at damaged
chromatin.

Li et al. (2010) studied Rnf8 -/- mice and observed growth retardation,
reduced hematopoietic populations, impaired spermatogenesis, impaired
CSR, and increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation in vitro and in
vivo. Activated Rnf8 -/- B cells were able to recruit reduced amounts of
53bp1 via Rnf8-independent mechanisms. Rnf8 -/- mice also had a somewhat
increased cancer predisposition. Li et al. (2010) concluded that RNF8 is
a tumor suppressor whose loss also results in increased
non-cancer-related mortality, likely due to immunodeficiency.

602334	TITLE *602334 EPITHELIAL MEMBRANE PROTEIN 2; EMP2
DESCRIPTION By homology screening of databases, Ben-Porath and Benvenisty (1996) and
Taylor and Suter (1996) independently identified a cDNA encoding
epithelial membrane protein-2 (EMP2). The predicted 167-amino acid EMP2
protein contains 4 membrane-spanning domains and 3 N-linked
glycosylation motifs in the first extracellular loop. Taylor and Suter
(1996) showed that the EMP2 cDNA generates an 18-kD protein in vitro.
The EMP2 protein shares 43% amino acid identity with peripheral myelin
protein-22 (PMP22; 601097); they are particularly homologous in their
transmembrane domains. Due to the high amino acid sequence homology
among PMP22, EMP1 (602334), EMP2, and EMP3 (602335), Ben-Porath and
Benvenisty (1996) stated that these proteins belong to a novel family.
Based on the suggested functions of PMP22, Ben-Porath and Benvenisty
(1996) and Taylor and Suter (1996) proposed that EMP2 is involved in
cell proliferation and cell-cell interactions. Using Northern blot
analysis, Taylor and Suter (1996) found prominent EMP2 expression in
adult ovary, heart, lung, and intestine and lower expression in most
other tissues, including the liver. In the fetus, they found high EMP2
mRNA levels in the lung and kidney and lower levels in the liver and
brain.

By somatic cell hybridization, radiation hybrid analysis, and YAC
library screening, Liehr et al. (1999) mapped the EMP2 gene to
chromosome 16p13.2. Ben Porath et al. (1998) mapped the homologous gene
in the mouse to chromosome 16.

613666	TITLE *613666 ALG11, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; ALG11
;;ASPARAGINE-LINKED GLYCOSYLATION 11, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF;;
KIAA0266
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ALG11 is a mannosyltransferase that uses GDP-mannose to sequentially add
the fourth and fifth mannose residues to growing dolichol-linked
oligosaccharide side chains at the outer leaflet of the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER). Upon completion, the lipid-linked polyoligosaccharides
are translocated to the ER lumen for subsequent transfer to substrate
asparagine residues of newly synthesized glycoproteins (Rind et al.,
2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated KG-1 immature
myeloid cell line, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned ALG11, which they
designated KIAA0266. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its
3-prime end, and the deduced protein contains 766 amino acids. Northern
blot analysis revealed low and uniform expression of ALG11 in all human
tissues and cell lines examined.

Rind et al. (2010) predicted that human ALG11 contains 2 Rossmann-like
type B domains, which are separated by a catalytic flexible hinge
region, and a conserved C-terminal nucleotide sugar-binding region.
ALG11 also has 2 predicted transmembrane domains and 2 putative
N-glycosylation sites. Immunofluorescence analysis of human fibroblasts
revealed colocalization of ALG11 with an ER marker, calnexin (CANX;
114217).

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the ALG11 gene
to chromosome 13. Hartz (2010) mapped the ALG11 gene to chromosome
13q14.3 based on an alignment of the ALG11 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
AK025456) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 Turkish sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with congenital
disorder of glycosylation type Ip (CDG1P; 613661), Rind et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous mutation (L86S; 613666.0001) in the ALG11 gene.
The phenotype was a multisystem metabolic disorder characterized by
hypotonia, seizures, developmental retardation, deafness, and death by
age 2 years. One affected child showed mild dysmorphic features.

In 3 unrelated patients with CDG1P, Thiel et al. (2012) identified
compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations in the ALG11 gene
(613666.0002-613666.0006). All mutations occurred in conserved residues,
and the cellular biochemical defects could be rescued by retroviral
complementation with wildtype ALG11. Glucose starvation prior to
metabolic labeling of patient-derived fibroblasts was a crucial step for
the correct biochemical diagnosis.

In 2 Turkish sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with congenital
disorder of glycosylation type Ip (CDG1P; 613661), Rind et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 257T-C transition in exon 2 of the ALG11 gene,
resulting in a leu86-to-ser (L86S) substitution in a highly conserved
region in the N terminus between 2 hydrophobic helices at the end of a
glycine-rich motif. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the
mutation, which was not found in 100 control alleles. Introduction of
wildtype ALG11 in patient fibroblasts and yeast deficient in the enzyme
complemented the biochemical abnormality. Immunofluorescent studies
showed that the mutation did not affect protein localization and did not
appear to affect the stability of the mannosyltransferase complex.
However, studies in yeast showed that the mutant L86S protein had some
residual activity, but not as much as wildtype, suggesting that it is a
leaky mutation.

compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ALG11 gene: an 18-bp
deletion (623_642) resulting in a frameshift and premature truncation
after 210 amino acids, and an 836A-C transversion resulting in a
tyr279-to-ser (Y279S; 613666.0003) substitution. The patient had
developmental delay, mental retardation, axial hypotonia, slight
peripheral hypertonia, no communication and poor social interaction,
seizures, and strabismus. Neither mutation was found in 120 control
alleles. Biochemical analysis showed a CDG type I pattern. However, the
pathologic glycosylation phenotype was only apparent after glucose
starvation in patient fibroblasts; then, analysis of dolichol-linked
oligosaccharides led to the emergence of pathologic shortened
intermediate dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, indicating a defect in
biosynthesis which could be rescued by retroviral complementation with
wildtype ALG11.

and a 1192G-A transition resulting in a glu398-to-lys (E398K;

603925	TITLE *603925 SYNAPTOGYRIN 1; SYNGR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Rat synaptogyrin, or RATSYNGR1, is an integral membrane protein
associated with presynaptic vesicles in neuronal cells. See SYNGR2
(603926). As part of an effort to sequence the long arm of human
chromosome 22, Kedra et al. (1998) identified the human homolog of
RATSYNGR1, synaptogyrin-1 (SYNGR1). By a combination of EST database
searching and library screening, the authors isolated cDNAs
corresponding to 3 alternatively spliced transcripts, which they
designated SYNGR1a-c. The predicted 1a, 1b, and 1c proteins contain 234,
191, and 192 amino acids, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed
that the 4.5-kb SYNGR1a mRNA is expressed at high levels in brain. The
other transcript forms are expressed at low levels in nonneuronal
tissues. In situ hybridization to embryonic and adult mouse tissues
confirmed that SYNGR1a, the most abundant transcript form, shows
predominantly neuronal expression. Kedra et al. (1998) also identified
cDNAs encoding the related human proteins SYNGR2 and SYNGR3 (603927) and
mouse Syngr1b. Like RATSYNGR1, the mouse and human synaptogyrin family
members contain 4 membrane-spanning domains. The conserved central
portion of SYNGR1a shares 54%, 61%, and 92% identity with that of
SYNGR2, SYNGR3, and RATSYNGR1, respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kedra et al. (1998) determined that the SYNGR1 gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

By inclusion within mapped clones, Kedra et al. (1998) mapped the SYNGR1
gene to chromosome 22q13. These authors found that SYNGR2 is located on
17qter and noted that the synaptogyrins and several other gene families
contain paralogous genes located on chromosomes 17 and 22. They stated
that this result supports the hypothesis that 17q and 22q are
evolutionarily closely related, and that these 2 regions in the human
genome are the result of a large chromosome duplication.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using gene targeting, Janz et al. (1999) generated mice lacking Syngr1.
They bred these Syngr1 knockout mice against Syp (313475) knockout mice
generated by McMahon et al. (1996) to create double knockout mice
deficient in both Syp and Syngr1. Both single and double knockout mice
were viable and fertile. Morphologic and biochemical analysis showed
that the architecture and composition of synapses were unaltered in the
brains of Syngr1 single knockout and Syngr1/Syp double knockout mutant
mice. Electrophysiologic recordings in the hippocampal CA1 region
revealed that short- and long-term synaptic plasticity was severely
reduced in the Syngr1/Syp double knockout mice without changes in the
fundamental release apparatus, vesicle cycling, or release probability.
Janz et al. (1999) concluded that Syngr1 and Syp perform essential and
redundant functions in synaptic plasticity without being required for
synaptic transmission as such.

From the results of cotransfection experiments, Janz et al. (1999)
concluded that Syp and Syngr1 are phosphorylated by c-fyn and c-src
tyrosine kinases. The absence of Syp and Syngr1 in knockout mice did not
markedly affect tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins.

ZINC FINGER CCHC DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; ZCCHC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching with the sequence of C. elegans lin28, a regulator
of developmental timing, Moss and Tang (2003) identified homologs in
several species from Drosophila to human. In each species the protein
contains a conserved combination of RNA-binding motifs: a cold shock
domain (CSD) and a pair of retroviral-type CCHC zinc knuckles. The human
and mouse LIN28A proteins share 97% sequence identity. Yang and Moss
(2003) showed that in mammals, LIN28A protein is stage-specifically
expressed in embryonic muscle, neurons, and epithelia, as well as in
embryonic carcinoma cells; however, it is suppressed in most adult
tissues except for skeletal and cardiac muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

Moss and Tang (2003) determined that the LIN28A gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Moss and Tang (2003) mapped the human LIN28A gene
to chromosome 1 and the mouse Lin28a gene to a region of syntenic
homology on chromosome 4.

Scott (2007) mapped the LIN28A gene to chromosome 1p36.11 based on an
alignment of the LIN28A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF521099) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

GENE FUNCTION

Wu and Belasco (2005) showed that human LIN28 mRNA is a target of the
micro RNAs miR-125b (610104) and miRNA-125a (611191). They identified 2
miRNA-responsive elements (miREs) that mediate repression in the 3-prime
UTR of LIN28. When the miREs were deleted, miRNA control over LIN28
nearly vanished. Lin28 downregulation by miR-125 involved reductions in
both translational efficiency and mRNA abundance.

By use of loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays in cultured
myoblasts, Polesskaya et al. (2007) showed that expression of Lin28 was
essential for skeletal muscle differentiation in mice and that Lin28
binds to polysomes, thereby increasing the efficiency of protein
synthesis. An important target of Lin28 is Igf2 (147470), a growth and
differentiation factor for muscle tissue. Interaction of Lin28 with
translation initiation complexes in skeletal myoblasts and in the
embryonic carcinoma cell line P19 was confirmed by localization of Lin28
to the stress granules, temporary structures that contain stalled
mRNA-protein translation complexes.

Yu et al. (2007) showed that 4 factors, OCT4 (164177), SOX2 (184429),
NANOG (607937), and LIN28, are sufficient to reprogram human somatic
cells to pluripotent stem cells that exhibit the essential
characteristics of embryonic stem cells. These induced pluripotent human
stem cells have normal karyotypes, express telomerase activity, express
cell surface markers and genes that characterize human ES cells, and
maintain the developmental potential to differentiate into advanced
derivatives of all 3 primary germ layers.

Viswanathan et al. (2008) showed that Lin28 selectively blocks the
processing of Let7 (see 605386) primary (pri-Let7) miRNAs in embryonic
cells. Using in vitro and in vivo studies, they found that Lin28 is
necessary and sufficient for blocking Microprocessor-mediated cleavage
of pri-Let7 miRNAs. Viswanathan et al. (2008) concluded that their
results identified Lin28 as a negative regulator of miRNA biogenesis,
and suggested that Lin28 may play a central role in blocking
miRNA-mediated differentiation in stem cells and in certain cancers.

Viswanathan et al. (2009) found that overexpression of murine Lin28 and
Lin28b (611044) in NIH/3T3 cells depleted levels of multiple mature
miRNAS in the LET7 family and resulted in increased c-Myc (190080) as
well as colony formation. Cells expressing either Lin28 or human LIN28B
formed tumors in nude mice. In vitro and in vivo studies with
cytokine-dependent BaF/3 cells showed that overexpression of LIN28 could
facilitate cellular transformation. LIN28 and LIN28B were found to be
overexpressed in primary human tumors and human cancer cell lines
(overall frequency of about 15%), and overexpression was linked to
repression of LET7 family miRNAs and derepression of LET7 target genes.
The findings provided a mechanism for the coordinate repression of LET7
miRNAs observed in a subset of human cancers, and associated activation
of LIN28 and LIN28B with poor clinical prognosis.

West et al. (2009) differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells carrying a
Stella (DPPA3; 608408) transgenic reporter into putative primordial germ
cells (PGCs) in vitro. The Stella-positive cells possessed a
transcriptional profile similar to embryo-derived PGCs, and like their
counterparts in vivo, lost imprints in a time-dependent manner. Using
inhibitory RNAs to screen candidate genes for effects on the development
of Stella-positive cells in vitro, West et al. (2009) found that Lin28,
a negative regulator of let7 microRNA processing, is essential for
proper PGC development. Furthermore, Blimp1 (PRDM1; 603423), a let7
target and a master regulator of PGC specification, rescued the effect
of Lin28 deficiency during PGC development, thereby establishing a
mechanism of action for Lin28 during PGC specification. Overexpression
of Lin28 promotes formation of Stella-positive cells in vitro and PGCs
in chimeric embryos, and is associated with human germ cell tumors.

Hanna et al. (2009) demonstrated that the reprogramming by Oct4, Sox2,
Klf4, and Myc transcription factors is a continuous stochastic process
where almost all mouse donor cells eventually give rise to induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cells on continued growth and transcription
factor expression. Additional inhibition of the p53 (191170)/p21
(116899) pathway or overexpression of Lin28 increased the cell division
rate and resulted in an accelerated kinetics of iPS cell formation that
was directly proportional to the increase in cell proliferation. In
contrast, Nanog overexpression accelerated reprogramming in a
predominantly cell division rate-independent manner. Quantitative
analyses defined distinct cell division rate-dependent and -independent
modes for accelerating the stochastic course of reprogramming, and
suggested that the number of cell divisions is a key parameter driving
epigenetic reprogramming to pluripotency.

The pluripotency factor LIN28 blocks the expression of LET7 microRNAs in
undifferentiated cells during development by binding to pre-LET7 RNAs
and recruiting RNA uridyltransferases ZCCHC11 (613692) and ZCCHC6 to
uridylate pre-let7. The identity of the RNase that degrades uridylated
pre-LET7 was unknown. Chang et al. (2013) identified Dis3l2 (614184) as
the 3-prime-5-prime exonuclease responsible for the decay of uridylated
pre-let7 in mouse embryonic stem cells. Biochemical reconstitution
assays showed that 3-prime oligouridylation stimulates Dis3l2 activity
in vitro, and knockdown of Dis3l2 in mouse embryonic stem cells leads to
the stabilization of pre-let7. Chang et al. (2013) concluded that their
study established 3-prime oligouridylation as an RNA decay signal for
DIS3L2 and identified the first physiologic RNA substrate of this
exonuclease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhu et al. (2010) generated transgenic mice expressing Lin28a and
observed increased body size and crown-rump length, with increased bone
mineral content and density, and delayed onset of puberty. The
transgenic mice also had increased glucose metabolism and insulin
sensitivity. Zhu et al. (2010) noted that this phenotype models that of
human phenotypes (see MENAQ2, 612882) associated with genetic variation
in the LIN28-LET7 pathway.

;;GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN, RHO, 1;;
RHOGAP1;;
RHOGAP;;
CDC42GAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Rho family of GTP-binding proteins modulates cytoskeletal changes.
Garrett et al. (1991) purified a 29-kD cytoplasmic GTPase-activating
protein (GAP), called RHOGAP by them, from human spleen extracts. RHOGAP
stimulated the GTPase activity of p21-Rho but not other small molecular
mass GTP-binding proteins. Diekmann et al. (1991) reported a partial
amino acid sequence of RHOGAP. Using PCR with primers based on the
RHOGAP protein sequence, Lancaster et al. (1994) isolated a human
fibrosarcoma cell line cDNA encoding RHOGAP. Northern blot analysis
revealed that RHOGAP is expressed as a 3.6-kb mRNA. The RHOGAP cDNA
encodes a predicted 439-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular
mass of 50 kD. Since antibodies against RHOGAP detected a 50-kD protein
on Western blots of cell extracts, Lancaster et al. (1994) suggested
that the previously observed 29-kD protein was a C-terminal proteolytic
fragment of RHOGAP that was generated during protein purification.

Barfod et al. (1993) cloned human platelet-precursor cell cDNAs encoding
CDC42GAP, a protein that inactivates CDC42 by stimulating GTP
hydrolysis. They found that CDC42GAP contains a functional SH3-binding
domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Lancaster et al. (1994) found that the Rho family members Rho, RAC, and
CDC42 (116952) were substrates for RHOGAP, with CDC42 the preferred
substrate.

Shen et al. (2008) showed that Nudel (NDEL1; 607538) colocalized with
Cdc42gap at the leading edge of migrating NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts. This
localization of Nudel required its phosphorylation by Erk1 (MAPK3;
601795)/Erk2 (MAPK1; 176948). Shen et al. (2008) found that Nudel
competed with Cdc42 for binding Cdc42gap. Consequently, Nudel inhibited
Cdc42gap-mediated inactivation of Cdc42 in a dose-dependent manner.
Depletion of Nudel by RNA interference or overexpression of a
nonphosphorylatable Nudel mutant abolished Cdc42 activation and cell
migration. Shen et al. (2008) concluded that NUDEL facilitates cell
migration by sequestering CDC42GAP at the leading edge to stabilize
active CDC42 in response to extracellular stimuli.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RHOGAP1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP RH79109).

;;KIAA0415;;
SPG48 GENE; SPG48
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1997) cloned KIAA0415. The deduced 634-amino
acid protein shares weak similarity with cyclin A1 (CCNA1; 604036).
RT-PCR detected variable KIAA0415 expression in all tissues examined. In
vitro-translated KIAA0415 had an apparent molecular mass of 68 kD by
SDS-PAGE.

Using RNA interference to screen HeLa cells for proteins involved in
homologous recombination DNA double-strand break repair, followed by
database analysis, Slabicki et al. (2010) identified KIAA0415, which
they called SPG48. KIAA0415 has a putative C-terminal helicase domain
characteristic of superfamily 2 (SF2)-type helicases. Western blot
analysis detected 2 possible KIAA0415 isoforms. Cell fractionation
revealed that the shorter isoform was predominantly nuclear, whereas the
longer isoform was predominantly cytoplasmic.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis of HeLa cells, Slabicki et al. (2010)
showed that KIAA0415 exists in a core protein complex containing SPG11
(610844), SPG15 (ZFYVE26; 612012), C20ORF29 (AP5S1; 614824), and
DKFZp761E198 (614367). Knockdown of KIAA0415, C20ORF29, or SPG15 in HeLa
cells reduced homologous recombination in a test substrate, whereas
knockdown of SPG11 or DKFZp761E198 had no effect. Knockdown of KIAA0415
also reduced homologous recombination in U2OS human osteosarcoma cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Slabicki et al. (2010) determined that the KIAA0415 gene contains 17
coding exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the KIAA0415
gene to chromosome 7. Gross (2010) mapped the KIAA0415 gene to
chromosome 7p22.1 based on an alignment of the KIAA0415 sequence
(GenBank GENBANK AB007875) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By direct sequencing of the KIAA0415 gene in 166 unrelated patients with
unexplained hereditary spastic paraplegia, Slabicki et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous truncating mutation (613653.0001) in 2 affected
French sibs. Another patient with sporadic disease was heterozygous for
a deletion (613653.0002), but a second mutation was not identified. The
phenotype was consistent with adult-onset SPG48 (613647). Studies of
lymphoblastoid cells derived from 1 patient showed increased sensitivity
to DNA-damaging drugs. The findings suggested a link between this form
of spastic paraplegia, which could be considered a neurodegenerative
disease, and defects in DNA repair. Slabicki et al. (2010) studied
KIAA0415 as a candidate gene in this disorder because of its role in a
complex with the other SPG-related genes SPG11 and SPG15.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 48, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
KIAA0415, 4-BP DEL/22-BP INS, NT80

In 2 French sibs with autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia-48 (SPG48;
613647), Slabicki et al. (2010) identified a homozygous complex
insertion/deletion mutation in exon 2 of the KIAA0415 gene. The mutation
comprised a 4-bp deletion (80del4) and a 22-bp insertion (84ins22),
resulting in a frameshift and premature stop codon following residue 29.
The insertion was found to be an imperfect quadruplication of a
sequence, suggesting DNA polymerase slippage during DNA synthesis as the
pathogenetic mechanism. The patients presented with progressive spastic
paraplegia associated with urinary incontinence from ages 50 and 49
years, respectively. One had a normal cerebral MRI, whereas the other
had spinal hyperintensities in the cervical spine. The unaffected
parents were not known to be consanguineous, but they originated from 2
neighboring villages. The mutation was not found in 156 Caucasian or 242
North African control chromosomes. Studies of lymphoblastoid cells
derived from 1 patient showed increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging
drugs. The findings suggested a link between this form of spastic
paraplegia, which could be considered a neurodegenerative disease, and
defects in DNA repair.

SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 48

In a patient with sporadic SPG48 (613647), Slabicki et al. (2010)
identified a heterozygous 14-bp deletion (1413del14) in the KIAA04015
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination following
residue 56. No family members were available for study, and no copy
number variations were found on chromosome 7, but a second small change
affecting the KIAA0415 gene could not be completely excluded. The
mutation was not found in 158 Caucasian or 84 North African control
chromosomes.

611312	TITLE *611312 CORNULIN; CRNN
;;CHROMOSOME 1 OPEN READING FRAME 10; C1ORF10;;
PDRC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display PCR to compare genes expressed in esophageal
cancer tissues to those expressed in adjacent normal esophageal mucosa,
Xu et al. (2000) identified a differentially expressed transcript, which
they named C1ORF10. The C1ORF10 cDNA encodes a deduced 490-amino acid
protein with 1 transmembrane domain, an N-terminal EF-hand
calcium-binding motif of about 90 amino acids that shares 25 to 35%
identity to human S100 calcium-binding proteins (e.g., 114085), and a
conserved consecutive repeat sequence of about 60 amino acids. Northern
blot analysis of 16 human adult tissues revealed restricted expression
of an approximately 2.0-kb C1ORF10 transcript in esophagus. Expression
in esophageal cancer tissue was greatly reduced or absent compared to
the expression in matched adjacent normal esophageal mucosa.

Contzler et al. (2005) further characterized the C10ORF10 protein, which
they called cornulin. They found that the protein contains 2 EF-hand
domains in the N terminus and shares sequence and structural identity
with members of the 'fused protein' family (e.g., repetin) as well as
with members of the S100 protein family. RT-PCR analysis detected
expression of cornulin in fetal bladder, scalp skin, foreskin, and in
cultured primary keratinocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a Ca2+ overlay assay, Contzler et al. (2005) demonstrated that the
EF-hand domains of cornulin bind calcium. Confocal microscopy of HeLa
cells transfected with EGFP-labeled cornulin showed that cornulin was
distributed throughout the cytoplasm with denser staining occurring
around the nucleus; deletion of the EF-hand domains resulted in a
granular pattern of staining throughout the whole cell.
Immunofluorescence studies showed cornulin staining in the granular and
lower cornified cells of foreskin and also in the granular layer and
inner root sheath of the hair follicle in scalp skin; prominent staining
was observed on esophagus sections at the periphery of the cells of the
granular and the upper spinous layers. Because expression of cornulin
was especially high in Ca(2+)-differentiating cells, Contzler et al.
(2005) suggested that cornulin is a marker of late epidermal
differentiation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Xu et al. (2000) determined that the C1ORF10 gene contains 3 exons, the
first of which is noncoding, and spans 5 kb.

Contzler et al. (2005) found that the gene structure of C1ORF10 is
similar to that of members of the 'fused gene' family. C1ORF10 has a
short first noncoding exon, a long intron 1, a second exon containing
the initiation codon and the first EF-hand motif, and a third exon
containing the second EF-hand motif.

MAPPING

Using a radiation hybrid panel, Xu et al. (2000) mapped the
C1ORf10/cornulin gene to human chromosome 1q21. By sequence analysis,
Contzler et al. (2005) mapped the gene within the epidermal
differentiation complex on 1q21, very close to other members of the
'fused gene' family.

;;KIAA1036
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned VASH1, which they called KIAA1036.
The deduced protein contains 365 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected
intermediate expression in adult heart, brain, lung, liver, kidney,
ovary, and spinal cord, as well as in fetal brain. Lower expression was
detected in skeletal muscle, testis, pancreas, and fetal liver, and
little to no expression was detected in spleen. All specific adult brain
regions examined showed low to moderate expression.

By microarray analysis, Watanabe et al. (2004) found that the KIAA1036
gene was upregulated in endothelial cells (ECs) by VEGF (192240), and
they renamed the gene vasohibin. The deduced vasohibin protein contains
a cluster of basic amino acids in its C terminus and no classic
secretion signal sequence. Northern blot analysis revealed prominent
expression in brain and placenta, and lower expression in heart and
kidney. Vasohibin expression was robust between embryonic weeks 6 to 12
in heart, brain, kidney, lung, skeletal muscle, and whole embryo.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected vasohibin at the endothelial layer
of placenta and brain. Western blot analysis detected vasohibin at an
apparent molecular mass of 42 kD in intact human umbilical vein ECs and
at 30 kD in the medium, indicating proteolytic processing during
secretion.

GENE FUNCTION

Following expression in insect cells, Watanabe et al. (2004) found that
recombinant vasohibin inhibited the migration, proliferation, and
network formation by ECs as well as angiogenesis in vivo. The inhibitory
effect was selective to ECs, as the protein did not affect the migration
of smooth muscle cells or fibroblasts. Eliminating the expression of
vasohibin in ECs restored their responsiveness to higher concentrations
of VEGF. Expression of vasohibin was selective to ECs, and hypoxia or
TNFA (191160) abrogated its inducible expression. Transfection of Lewis
lung carcinoma cells with the vasohibin gene did not affect the
proliferation of the cancer cells in vitro, but did inhibit tumor growth
and tumor angiogenesis in vivo in mice. Watanabe et al. (2004) concluded
that vasohibin is an endothelium-derived negative feedback regulator of
angiogenesis.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the VASH1
gene to chromosome 14 (TMAP RH80381).

188300	TITLE *188300 THYMIDINE KINASE, SOLUBLE; TK1
DESCRIPTION Thymidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.21) catalyzes the phosphorylation of
thymidine to deoxythymidine monophosphate. Genetic variation in soluble
thymidine kinase has not been identified in man. Weiss and Green (1967)
found that fusion of mouse cells lacking this enzyme with normal human
cells could be achieved, that progressive loss of human chromosomes from
the hybrid occurred with passage of time, and that at a stage when only
one human chromosome remained the cell still had the capacity to
synthesize thymidine kinase. The assumption was that the remaining
chromosome, now identified as chromosome 17 (Migeon and Miller, 1968;
Miller et al., 1971), carries the TK locus. Boone et al. (1972)
presented evidence that TK is on the long arm of chromosome 17.
McDougall et al. (1973) showed that adeno-12 virus causes a gap in the
long arm of chromosome 17. Since the adeno-12 virus causes a 2- or
3-fold increase in TK, the gap may represent the TK locus and may be
comparable to a puff. By study of an 11-17 translocation in mouse-man
hybrid cells, Francke and Busby (1974) located the TK locus to the
region distal to q21. In the African green monkey, the thymidine kinase
and galactokinase (604313) loci are both on a chromosome similar to
human E-17 in size, shape and Giemsa banding pattern (Croce et al.,
1974). This is another striking example of chromosomal homology. Lin et
al. (1983) cloned the TK1 gene and estimated its maximal size to be 14
kilobase pairs and its minimal size between 4 and 5 kilobase pairs. The
gene contains many noncoding inserts and numerous Alu sequences.
Nucleotide sequencing indicated considerable evolutionary conservation
of the TK gene; Bradshaw and Deininger (1984) found about 70% homology
between the human and chicken genes. Flemington et al. (1987) sequenced
the entire 12.9-kb human TK gene, along with flanking regions. TK is
composed of 7 exons. Within the introns, 13 Alu family repeated
sequences and a polypyrimidine stretch were found. Sherley and Kelly
(1988) purified and characterized the enzyme from HeLa cells.
Kucherlapati et al. (1974) assigned the TK1 locus to 17q21-q22. By
chromosome-mediated gene transfer (CMGT), Klobutcher and Ruddle (1979)
transferred the genes for thymidine kinase, galactokinase, and type I
procollagen (120150). The data indicated the following gene order:
cen--GALK--(TK1--COL1A1). Studies by vanTuinen and Ledbetter (1987) led
to the conclusion that TK is located in the segment 17q23-qter, which is
consistent with the conclusion of Sparkes et al. (1986). Xu et al.
(1988) mapped the TK locus to 17q23-q25 by in situ hybridization. Xu et
al. (1988) also used CMGT in the generation of a physical map of
chromosome 17. This is an established method of constructing hybrid
cells containing subchromosomal fragments of a selected donor
chromosome. The generation of transfectants for chromosome 17 is helped
by the presence of the selectable marker TK. Xu et al. (1988) generated
a panel of more than 50 transfectants containing different transgenomic
fragments of chromosome 17. By analyzing cotransfection frequencies, Xu
et al. (1988) found groups of loci that are closely situated on
chromosome 17. Their results confirmed, however, that although
substantial lengths of DNA may be transferred intact, interstitial
deletions occur frequently. Furthermore, multiple fragments of
transfected chromatin can be found in the same clone, and there is
selection for centromeric sequences. Their overall results indicated the
following order:
pter--(TP53--POLR2--D17S1)--(MYHSA2--MYHSA1)--D17Z1--CRYB1--
(ERBA1--GCSF--NGL)--acute promyelocytic leukemia
breakpoint--RNU2--HOX2--
(NGFR--COL1A1--MPO)--GAA--UMPH--GHC--TK1--GALK--qter. In the 5-prime
flanking region of the TK gene, Sauve et al. (1990) located the position
of nucleotide sequences that can act as binding sites for transacting
factors as well as potential cis-acting sequences. The latter were
compared with those of the promoter of the human PCNA gene (176740).
Both TK and PCNA are maximally expressed at the G1/S boundary of the
cell cycle.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Kuo et al. (1996) mapped both GAA
(232300) and the thymidine kinase gene to 17q25.2-q25.3 and showed that
GAA is distal to TK1.

604720	TITLE *604720 TRANSFERRIN RECEPTOR 2; TFR2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

While attempting to isolate genes encoding new transcriptional factors
from a TF-1 (erythroid leukemia) cell cDNA library, Kawabata et al.
(1999) cloned an 831-bp human cDNA fragment that had significant amino
acid homology to the middle portion of the classic transferrin receptor
protein (TFRC; 190010). Using 5-prime/3-prime RACE, they cloned a
full-length, 2.9-kb cDNA, which they designated TFR2. They identified 2
transcripts: a 2.9-kb transcript, called alpha, and an approximately
2.5-kb transcript, called beta, which was cloned from an HL60 (myeloid
leukemia) cell cDNA library. The alpha form predicts an 801-amino acid
type II membrane protein that shares 45% identity and 66% similarity in
its extracellular domain with TFRC. The beta form, which may be an
alternative product of splicing or promoter usage, lacks the
amino-terminal portion of TFR2-alpha, including the putative
transmembrane domain. Northern blot analysis showed that the alpha form
is predominantly expressed in the liver and also in the K562
erythromegakaryocytic cell line; no expression of the beta form was
found. By RT-PCR analysis, TFR2-alpha was expressed in the liver,
spleen, lung, muscle, prostate, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells,
whereas expression of TFR-beta was found in all tissues tested.
Expression of human TFR2 conferred binding of holotransferrin and uptake
of transferrin-bound iron to a Chinese hamster ovary cell line lacking
endogenous TFRC. Kawabata et al. (1999) concluded that TFR2-alpha may be
a second transferrin receptor that can mediate cellular iron transport.

GENE FUNCTION

The majority of hepatic iron uptake under normal circumstances is
transferrin-mediated. However, expression of TFRC in hepatocytes, as in
other nonreticuloendothelial cell types, is downregulated in response to
increased intracellular iron. As a consequence, TFRC expression in liver
is undetectable in hereditary hemochromatosis (235200) patients with
hepatic iron loading. Nonetheless, hepatic iron loading in
hemochromatosis patients is progressive. Fleming et al. (2000) provided
support for a mechanism that involves the uptake of transferrin-bound
iron by TFR2. By screening a murine EST database for Tfrc sequences,
they identified a cDNA encoding a protein homologous to murine Tfrc.
They characterized the murine TFR2 ortholog and compared expression of
murine Tfrc and Tfr2 in normal mice, mice with iron deficiency, and mice
with iron overload. Unlike Tfrc, the Tfr2 transcript was highly
expressed in hepatocytes, was not regulated by tissue iron status, and
was not downregulated in a murine model of hereditary hemochromatosis.
From these observations, Fleming et al. (2000) proposed that TFR2
continues to mediate uptake of transferrin-bound iron by the liver after
TFRC is downregulated by iron overload, and thus may explain increased
susceptibility of the liver to iron loading in hereditary
hemochromatosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kawabata et al. (1999) determined the genomic structure of the TFR2
gene. The alpha transcript contains 18 exons. The beta transcript lacks
exons 1 through 3 and has an additional 142 bases at the 5-prime end of
exon 4.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Kawabata et al. (1999) mapped the TFR2
gene to chromosome 7q22.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Camaschella et al. (2000) identified a premature termination mutation at
codon 250 in the TFR2 gene in homozygosity in a Sicilian family
segregating hemochromatosis type 3 (HFE3; 604250). The Y250X mutation
(604720.0001) identified by Camaschella et al. (2000) is located in a
region shared by both the alpha and beta transcripts of TFR2. A
phenotype of iron overload associated with the absence of the functional
gene suggested TFR2 is more likely involved in iron regulation rather
than iron uptake. Although TFR2 is highly expressed in an erythroid cell
line, none of the HFE3 patients that they studied showed erythrocyte
abnormalities. Rather, the patients tolerated long-term phlebotomies
without developing anemia. Thus, Camaschella et al. (2000) concluded
that TFR2, in contrast to TFRC, is not essential during erythroid
maturation.

Feder et al. (1996) found that about 15% of heriditary hemochromatosis
patients of northern European descent do not carry the C282Y mutation of
the HFE gene (613609.0001). Mattman et al. (2002) studied a group of
non-C282Y hemochromatosis patients and identified several sequence
variants, including a homozygous missense mutation in exon 17 of the
TFR2 gene, which resulted in a gln690-to-pro amino acid change
(604720.0005).

Hofmann et al. (2002) performed mutation analysis of the TFR2 gene in
patients with atypical hemochromatosis. They also questioned whether
differences in penetrance of the HFE C282Y mutation (613609.0001) were
associated with mutations in the TFR2 gene. They studied sib pairs
homozygous for cys282-to-tyr with a discordant phenotype. The most
common discordance between homozygous sibs was in serum transferrin
concentration. Many of these patients, however, also exhibited
significant differences in liver fibrosis and liver enzyme levels. They
also studied individuals who were not homozygous for C282Y with evidence
of iron excess, and other atypical groups. In a pair of brothers
homozygous for the C282Y mutation, they found an arg455-to-gln mutation
in TFR2 (604720.0004) only in the brother with liver fibrosis,
suggesting that TFR2 functions as a modifier for penetrance of the
hemochromatosis phenotype when present with homozygosity for C282Y.
Unlike TFR1 expression, TFR2 expression is not downregulated in the
liver of iron-loaded mice (Fleming et al., 2000). The screening for
mutations in all 18 exons indicated that mutations of the TFR2 gene are
rare.

ANIMAL MODEL

To characterize the role of TFR2 in iron homeostasis, Fleming et al.
(2002) generated a premature stop codon (Y245X), which was introduced by
targeted mutagenesis in the murine Tfr2 coding sequence. Codon 245 is
the mouse ortholog of codon 250, which is involved in the C250Y mutation
(604720.0001) of TFR2 in human hemochromatosis, and is located in a
region that is conserved between the mouse and human genomes. Fleming et
al. (2002) observed that by 4 weeks of age, mice homozygous for the
Y245X mutation developed periportal hepatic iron loading, splenic iron
sparing, and elevated serum transferrin saturations. Thus, the mutant
mice seemed to provide a faithful model for the abnormalities in iron
homeostasis observed in patients with loss of TFR2. Heterozygous mice
did not differ in any measured parameter from wildtype mice.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 3
TFR2, TYR250TER

In 2 families from Sicily who met diagnostic criteria for
hemochromatosis (604250) but were not linked to HFE, one of which was
consanguineous, Camaschella et al. (2000) identified a C-to-G
transversion in exon 6 at position 750 of the TFR2 cDNA sequence,
resulting in a tyrosine (TAC)-to-stop (TAG) substitution at residue 250
(Y250X). This substitution created a MaeI site. All affected members of
the consanguineous family were homozygous for Y250X, whereas obligate
carriers were heterozygous. One patient in the nonconsanguineous family
was homozygous for this mutation. Camaschella et al. (2000) did not find
the Y250X mutation in 100 normal chromosomes or in 12 hemochromatosis
patients who did not have mutations in HFE.

.0002
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 3
TFR2, 1-BP INS, 84C

In all affected members of a large inbred family in Campania in southern
Italy segregating hemochromatosis (604250), Roetto et al. (2001) found a
1-bp insertion of a cytosine residue in homozygous state in exon 2 in a
polyC tract (84-88 insC). The mutation resulted in a frameshift followed
by a premature stop codon, a glu60-to-ter (E60X) substitution. Because
of consanguinity, a pseudodominant pedigree pattern was observed in an
affected father and his 3 affected children in one branch of the family.
Heterozygosity was not associated with iron overload, even in
individuals also heterozygous for H63D (613609.0002) at the HFE locus or
for the beta-thalassemia trait.

.0003
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 3
TFR2, MET172LYS

In a family in which the proband had severe hemochromatosis (604250),
Roetto et al. (2001) found homozygosity for a T-to-A transversion
(515T-A) in exon 4 of TFR2 cDNA, resulting in a met172-to-lys (M172K)
substitution of the protein. The proband had cirrhosis, hypogonadism,
and cardiac disease. He had inherited beta-thalassemia in heterozygous
state from his mother.

.0004
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 1, MODIFIER OF
TFR2, ARG455GLN

Hofmann et al. (2002) studied 2 brothers who were homozygous for the
common hemochromatosis-causing mutation of the HFE gene, cys282 to tyr
(613609.0001). Direct nucleotide sequencing found a G-to-A transversion
at nucleotide 1391, resulting in an arg455-to-gln (R455Q) amino acid
change in the TFR2 gene. The R455Q mutation was present in only 1 of the
brothers homozygous for C282Y; that brother had evidence of liver
fibrosis, whereas the other brother did not.

.0005
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 3
TFR2, GLN690PRO

In a Portuguese man with severe hemochromatosis (604250) and in 2 family
members, Mattman et al. (2002) found a gln690-to-pro (Q690P) mutation in
the TFR2 gene. The patient presented at 29 years of age with fatigue,
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, hyperpigmentation, mild elevation of
liver transaminases, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. He had
markedly elevated serum iron indices and had had more than 12 g of iron
removed via phlebotomy in the previous 4 years. Additional hematologic
abnormalities included mild normocytic anemia and lymphopenia. He was
heterozygous for the H63D mutation in the HFE gene (613609.0002).
Mattman et al. (2002) stated that this patient was the only one of 89
non-C282Y hereditary chromatosis patients of predominately mixed
European descent in whom mutation of the TFR2 gene had been found.

600540	TITLE *600540 TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR Sp4; SP4
;;HF1B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transcriptional regulation is exerted through protein factors that bind
to distinct DNA elements in the vicinity of target genes. Many control
elements are recognized by different members of transcription factor
families, opening combinatorial possibilities of the regulatory
interactions. Among the most widely distributed control elements are GC
boxes and related motifs bound by SP1 (189906). Hagen et al. (1992)
performed recognition site screening for factors which bind to the
uteroglobin promoter sequence GT box and cloned cDNAs encoding the
DNA-binding proteins SP3 (601804) and SP4, thus revealing the existence
of a multigene family of SP proteins. They found that SP1, SP3, and SP4
exhibit similar structural features: all contain DNA-binding domains
composed of 3 zinc fingers of the cys2/his2 type near the C terminus,
and all recognize GC- and GT-box sequences. Additionally, the N termini
of all 3 proteins are composed of long serine/threonine- and
glutamine-rich regions that have been identified in SP1 as
transactivation domains. Hagen et al. (1992) showed by Northern blot
analysis that SP4 is abundantly expressed as a 7.5-kb message in brain,
but barely detectable in other human cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Hagen et al. (1995) used cotransfection experiments to show that SP4 is
an activator protein like SP1. However, in contrast to SP1, they found
that SP4 is not able to act synergistically through adjacent binding
sites.

Hirose and Horvitz (2013) showed that the C. elegans Sp1 transcription
factor SPTF3, which is most similar to human SP4, specifies the
programmed cell deaths of at least 2 cells, the sisters of the
pharyngeal M4 motor neuron and the AQR sensory neuron, by
transcriptionally activating both caspase-dependent and -independent
apoptotic pathways. SPTF3 directly drives the transcription of the gene
egl-1, which encodes a BH3-only protein that promotes apoptosis through
the activation of the CED3 caspase. In addition, SPTF3 directly drives
the transcription of the AMP-activated protein kinase-related gene
pig-1, which encodes a protein kinase closely related to mammalian MELK
(607025), and functions in apoptosis of the M4 sister and AQR sister
independently of the pathway that activated CED3. Hirose and Horvitz
(2013) concluded that a single transcription factor controls 2 distinct
cell-killing programs that act in parallel to drive apoptosis.

MAPPING

Kalff-Suske et al. (1995) assigned the SP4 gene to human chromosome 7
using Southern blot hybridization to a human-rodent somatic cell hybrid
panel. Subsequently, they narrowed the assignment to 7p21-p13 by PCR
amplification of genomic template DNA from somatic cell hybrids
containing fragments of this chromosome. The chromosomal localization
was further refined by fluorescence in situ hybridization to 7p15. The
previous assignment of the SP1 gene to chromosome 12q13, together with
the assignment of the SP4 gene to chromosome 7p15, increases the number
of known paralogous relationships between human chromosomes 7 and 12.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nguyen-Tran et al. (2000) reported that mice deficient in Hf1b/Sp4
survived to term and exhibited normal cardiac structure and function but
displayed sudden cardiac death and a complete penetrance of conduction
system defects, including spontaneous ventricular tachycardia and a high
incidence of AV block. Continuous electrocardiographic recordings
clearly documented cardiac arrhythmogenesis as the cause of death.
Single-cell analysis revealed an anatomic substrate for
arrhythmogenesis, including a decrease and mislocalization of connexins
and a marked increase in action potential heterogeneity. Two independent
markers revealed defects in the formation of ventricular Purkinje
fibers. The authors concluded that these studies identified a novel
genetic pathway for sudden cardiac death via defects in the transition
between ventricular and conduction system cell lineages.

Gollner et al. (2001) found that Sp4 knockout mice, with a complete
absence of Sp4 expression due to targeted deletion of the exons encoding
the N-terminal activation domains, showed a complex phenotype. They
developed until birth without obvious abnormalities. After birth,
two-thirds died within 4 weeks. Surviving mice were growth retarded.
Males homozygous for the null mutation did not breed; the reason for
this remained obscure since they showed complete spermatogenesis, and
pheromone receptor genes in the vomeronasal organ appeared unaffected.
Female null mice had a smaller thymus, spleen, and uterus and exhibited
a pronounced delay in sexual maturation. Thus, the phenotype of the
Sp4-null mice differed significantly from those described for the Sp1-
and Sp3-null mice. The authors concluded that the structural
similarities, the common recognition motif, and the overlapping
expression pattern of these 3 transcription factors do not reflect
similar physiologic functions.

Zhou et al. (2010) stated that mice with hypomorphic Sp4 expression
display subtle vacuolization of the hippocampus and deficits in
sensorimotor gating and contextual memory. They found that Sp4
hypomorphic mice also showed deficits in spatial learning and memory.
Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses of Sp4 hypomorphic brain
revealed reduced protein expression of the NMDA receptor subunit Nr1
(GRIN1; 138249) in hippocampus and cortex. No difference was observed in
expression of the 4 Nr2 proteins (e.g., GRIN2A; 138253), and RT-PCR
detected no difference in Nr1 mRNA levels between Sp4 hypomorphic and
wildtype hippocampus. Zhou et al. (2010) suggested that the Sp4
hypomorphic mouse may represent a novel hypoglutamatergic model for
psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (see 181500).

609548	TITLE *609548 LMAN1-LIKE PROTEIN; LMAN1L
;;ERGIC53-LIKE PROTEIN; ERGL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences highly expressed in prostate,
Yerushalmi et al. (2001) identified LMAN1L, which they called ERGL. The
deduced 527-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal signal sequence,
followed by a long extracellular lectin domain, a transmembrane domain,
and a short intracellular domain. ERGL has 1 possible glycosylation site
and 2 possible intracellular phosphorylation sites. The lectin and
transmembrane domains of ERGL share significant similarity with ERGIC53
(LMAN1; 601567). Northern blot analysis detected a strong, broad signal
between 4.4 and 7.5 kb in prostate and spleen, but not in other tissues.
Weaker but distinct 1.8- and 2.0-kb transcripts were detected in
prostate, and a 1.8-kb transcript was detected in spleen. RNA dot blot
analysis showed strongest ERGL expression in prostate, spleen, salivary
gland, and cardiac atrium. Weaker expression was observed in cerebellum,
spinal cord, appendix, adrenal gland, fetal spleen, and testis. PCR
analysis revealed 2 splice variants in prostate and a single variant in
salivary gland and spleen. In situ hybridization detected ERGL in normal
and neoplastic prostate epithelial cells, in acinar and duct epithelial
cells of salivary gland, in neurons and astrocytes of cerebral cortex,
in Purkinje cells of cerebellum, in motor neurons of the spinal cord
ventral horn, and in marginal zones of B-cell follicles in spleen.
Diffuse ERGL expression was detected in cardiac atrial muscle sarcoplasm
and in isolated subendocardial cells, but not in cardiac ventricles.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Yerushalmi et al. (2001) mapped the LMAN1L
gene to chromosome 15q22-q23.

612960	TITLE *612960 EPITHELIAL SPLICING REGULATORY PROTEIN 2; ESRP2
;;RNA-BINDING MOTIF PROTEIN 35B; RBM35B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ESPR2 is an epithelial cell-type-specific splicing regulator (Warzecha
et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using a cell-based cDNA expression screen with human embryonic kidney
293T cells, Warzecha et al. (2009) identified mouse Esrp1 (612959) and
Esrp2 as regulators of FGFR2 (176943) splicing. By database analysis,
they identified human ESRP2, which encodes a deduced protein containing
3 central RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). Comparison of ESRP orthologs in
diverse species showed significant sequence conservation within the RRM
domains, particularly RRM1. In mouse embryos, expression of Esrp2
appeared to be specific to epithelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Cell type-specific expression of epithelial and mesenchymal isoforms of
FGFR2 is achieved through tight regulation of mutually exclusive exons
IIIb and IIIc, respectively. Warzecha et al. (2009) showed that
expression of epitope-tagged mouse Esrp1 or Esrp2 in 293T cells induced
a substantial switch of endogenous FGFR2 transcripts from the
mesenchymal form with exon IIIc to the epithelial form with exon IIIb.
Microarray analysis revealed that cell lines classified as epithelial
expressed higher levels of ESRP1 and/or ESRP2 than cell lines classified
as mesenchymal. Depletion of ESRP1 and ESRP2 in a human prostate
epithelial cell line via RNA interference (RNAi) caused a significant
switch from exon IIIb to exon IIIc splicing in the endogenous FGFR2
transcript. Rescue experiments with mouse cDNAs showed that FGFR2-IIIb
splicing was more dependent on ESRP1 than ESRP2. RNAi experiments
revealed that ESRP1 and ESRP2 also regulated splicing of CD44 (107269),
CTNND1 (601045), and ENAH (609061), transcripts that undergo changes in
splicing during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the ESRP2 gene to chromosome 16q22.1 based on an
alignment of the ESRP2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK025571) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;KIAA1284;;
PDZ DOMAIN-CONTAINING 6; PDZK6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned INTU, which they designated
KIAA1284. The deduced 953-amino acid protein contains a PDZ domain.
RT-PCR ELISA detected highest expression in kidney, ovary, and fetal
brain, intermediate expression in heart, adult brain, liver, lung, and
skeletal muscle, and little to no expression in pancreas, spleen, and
fetal liver. INTU was expressed in all specific adult brain regions
examined with highest levels in amygdala, corpus callosum, caudate
nucleus, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and spinal cord.

By in situ hybridization of Xenopus embryos, Park et al. (2006) found
that Xint, the frog homolog of INTU, was expressed in the neural plate
during neural tube closure, with subsequent strong expression in the
ventral neural tube and in facial mesenchyme.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the INTU gene
to chromosome 4. By genomic sequence analysis, Park et al. (2006) mapped
the INTU gene to chromosome 4q28.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using an antisense morpholino-oligonucleotide, Park et al. (2006)
disrupted Xint expression in Xenopus embryos. Knockdown of Xint
disrupted Hedgehog (600725) signaling and caused defects in neural tube
closure, including exencephaly, spina bifida, and holoprosencephaly-like
features. The authors found that the Hedgehog defect in Xint-deficient
embryos was secondary to a failure of ciliogenesis and that Xint and
Fuzzy (FUZ; 610622) controlled the assembly of an apical actin network
that is essential for the normal orientation of ciliary microtubules.
Fluorescence microscopy revealed colocalization of Xint and Dishevelled
(601365) at the apical surface of ciliated Xenopus epidermal cells. Park
et al. (2006) concluded that Inturned, Fuzzy, and Dishevelled regulate
ciliogenesis in Hedgehog-responsive cells through a conserved planar
cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway.

NKX6.2, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Homeobox genes act as master genes that control pattern formation and
positional information during embryonic development. In the adult, they
are thought to maintain the differentiated states of cell populations
and to direct the renewal of specific cell types. While homeobox genes
are widely expressed in the developing vertebrate nervous system, only a
few, including NKX6B, continue to be expressed in the adult brain
(summary by Lee et al., 2001).

CLONING

Nkx6.2 was isolated in mouse by Komuro et al. (1993). Expression of
Nkx6.2 appeared to be tissue specific and developmentally regulated. In
day-18 mouse embryos, it was expressed in part of the forebrain as well
as in mid- and hindbrain, whereas in the adult CNS, expression was most
abundant in areas rich in oligodendrocyte cell bodies and astrocytes.
Together with DNA binding assays, these expression studies suggested
that the Nkx6.2 gene product may be important for differentiated
oligodendrocyte function and in the regulation of myelin gene
expression.

Lee et al. (2001) cloned and characterized NKX6B, the human homolog of
mouse Nkx6.2. The predicted 277-amino acid NKX6B protein shares 97%
identity with mouse Nkx6.2 and 52% homology with NKX6A (602563).
Northern blot analysis showed that NKX6B expression is tightly
controlled in a tissue-specific fashion, with highest expression in
brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

By DNA sequence analysis of an 11-kb genomic fragment, Lee et al. (2001)
demonstrated that the NKX6B gene spans 1.2 kb and contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

Using STS content mapping and radiation hybrid analysis, Lee et al.
(2001) mapped NKX6B gene to 10q26, a region where loss of heterozygosity
has frequently been observed in various malignant brain tumors. Lee et
al. (2001) suggested that NKX6B may be a tumor suppressor gene for brain
tumors, particularly for oligodendrogliomas.

Komuro et al. (1993) mapped the mouse Nkx6b gene to the distal portion
of chromosome 7.

603369	TITLE *603369 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE INHIBITOR 2C; CDKN2C
;;p18(INK4C)
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) are a group of low molecular
weight proteins that associate with cyclin-CDK complexes or CDKs alone
and inhibit their activity. Members of the INK4 family of CKIs, which
includes CDKN2C, specifically bind and inhibit CDK4 (123829) and CDK6
(603368), thereby preventing cyclin D-dependent phosphorylation of RB1
(614041). See INK4D (600947).

CLONING

By using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to search for CDK6-interacting
proteins, Guan et al. (1994) isolated a partial cDNA encoding a protein
that they designated p18 based on its molecular mass of 18 kD. They used
the partial cDNA to screen a HeLa cell library and recovered additional
cDNAs corresponding to the entire p18 coding region. Sequence analysis
revealed that the predicted 168-amino acid p18 protein shares 38% and
42% sequence identity with p16/INK4A (600160) and p14/INK4B (600431),
respectively. Like p14 and p16, p18 contains an ankyrin repeat domain.
Using Northern blot analysis, Guan et al. (1994) found that p18 is
expressed as multiple transcripts in various human tissues, with the
strongest expression in skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Guan et al. (1994) showed that, both in vivo and in vitro, p18
interacted strongly with CDK6 and weakly with CDK4, but not with the
other CDKs tested. Recombinant p18 inhibited the kinase activity of
cyclin D-CDK6 in vitro. Ectopic expression of either p16 or p18
suppressed the growth of human cells in a manner that appears to
correlate with the presence of a wildtype RB1 function.

GENE STRUCTURE

Blais et al. (1998) determined that the p18, or INK4C, gene contains 3
exons and spans more than 7.5 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Guan et al. (1994) mapped the p18
gene to 1p32, a chromosomal region associated with abnormalities in a
variety of human tumors.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lapointe et al. (1996) identified a single amino acid substitution
(ala72 to pro; A72P) in BT-20 human breast cancer cells that abrogated
the ability of p18 to interact with CDK6 and to suppress cell growth.
These authors suggested that p18 inactivation by point mutations may
contribute to deregulated growth control in certain cell lines and/or
tumors. Blais et al. (1998) found this p18 variant in 3 of 35 breast
tumors examined, and suggested that it may be a polymorphism.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zindy et al. (2001) determined that both Ink4c and Ink4d were expressed
in the seminiferous tubules of postnatal wildtype mice, being largely
confined to postmitotic spermatocytes undergoing meiosis. Loss of either
Ink4c or Ink4d alone was associated with male fertility, but
double-knockout males were sterile. Spermatogonia did not differentiate
properly and became apoptotic. Residual spermatozoa had reduced motility
and decreased viability. Loss of Ink4c alone or in combination with loss
of Ink4d was associated with impaired differentiation of Leydig cells
and reduced testosterone levels, but there was no effect on the levels
of luteinizing hormone produced by the anterior pituitary. Loss of Ink4c
or Ink4d, either singly or in combination, had no effect on female
reproductive function.

Bai et al. (2003) noted that targeted disruption of Ink4c in mice leads
to spontaneous pituitary tumors and lymphomas later in life. Treatment
of Inc4c null and heterozygous mice with a chemical carcinogen resulted
in tumor development at an accelerated rate. Bai et al. (2003) concluded
that, since the remaining wildtype allele of Ink4c was neither mutated
nor silenced in tumors derived from heterozygotes, Ink4c is a
haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in mice.

Using reconstituted mice with p18-deficient hematopoietic cells and in
vivo evaluation of stem cell function, Yuan et al. (2004) found that p18
inhibited cell division in hematopoietic stem cells and early
hematopoietic progenitor cells.

Nmyc (164840) promotes rapid cell division of granule neuron progenitors
(GNPs) in mice, and its conditional loss during embryonic cerebellar
development results in severe GNP deficiency, perturbs foliation, and
leads to reduced cerebellar mass. Since Nmyc loss triggers precocious
expression of Kip1 (CDKN1B; 600778) and Ink4c in the cerebellar
primordium, Zindy et al. (2006) disrupted Kip1 and Ink4c in Nmyc-null
cerebella and found that this partially rescued GNP cell proliferation
and cerebellar foliation. They concluded that expression of NMYC and
concomitant downregulation of INK4C and KIP1 contribute to the proper
development of the cerebellum.

611782	TITLE *611782 DOWN SYNDROME CELL ADHESION MOLECULE-LIKE 1; DSCAML1
;;DSCAM-LIKE 1;;
KIAA1132
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Hirosawa et al. (1999) obtained a partial cDNA encoding
DSCAML1, which they designated KIAA1132. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate
expression in adult and fetal brain and in all specific adult brain
regions examined. Low expression was detected in kidney and ovary, and
little to no expression was detected in all other tissues examined.

Agarwala et al. (2001) cloned full-length DSCAML1 by screening a fetal
brain cDNA library with the partial KIAA1132 cDNA. The deduced
2,053-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 224 kD. It
has a 1,573-amino acid extracellular domain, a 21-amino acid
transmembrane domain, and a 441-amino acid cytoplasmic domain. The
extracellular domain contains 10 Ig C2-type domains, 6 fibronectin (see
135600) type III domains, 15 N-glycosylation sites, an RGD-type cell
attachment sequence, and a carboxypeptidase (see CPA1; 114850)
zinc-binding region-2. The cytoplasmic domain contains 7 putative
phosphorylation sites and 6 N-myristoylation sites. The domain
structures of DSCAML1 and DSCAM (602523) are identical, and they share
64% and 45% amino acid identity in their extracellular and cytoplasmic
domains, respectively. Northern blot analysis detected a 7.6-kb
transcript in fetal and adult brain and in all adult brain sections
examined, except amygdala. A weak signal was detected in adult kidney.
Northern blot analysis of whole mouse embryos detected expression at 17
days postcoitum and in all postnatal stages tested. In adult mouse,
expression was detected only in brain. In situ hybridization revealed
Dscaml1 in the Purkinje cell layer of mouse cerebellum, in granule cells
of the dentate gyrus and in pyramidal cells of the CA1 and CA3 regions
of the hippocampus, and in olfactory bulb, with moderate expression in
cerebral cortex and thalamus. Immunohistochemical analysis of
transfected mouse fibroblasts and rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells showed
expression on the cell surface. In differentiated transfected PC12
cells, human DSCAML1 associated with axons, but not with dendrites.
Southern blot analysis suggested that DSCAML1 is highly conserved in
vertebrates.

By RT-PCR of adult human brain, Barlow et al. (2002) identified DSCAML1
splice variants lacking either exon 3 or 4, resulting in removal of
either the N- or C- terminal half of the Ig2 domain, respectively.
Barlow et al. (2002) noted that their full-length DSCAML1 cDNA has an
in-frame ATG 180 bp upstream of the translational start site reported by
Agarwala et al. (2001), resulting in a 60-amino acid N-terminal
extension to the protein. Northern blot analysis detected several
DSCAML1 splice variants in all human adult tissues examined. The 7.5-kb
transcript was expressed predominantly in brain, but was also present in
kidney, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and lung, along with smaller
variants. Expression was detected in all adult brain regions examined,
including amygdala. Mouse tissues showed an expression pattern
significantly different than that in human.

GENE FUNCTION

Agarwala et al. (2001) found that mouse cells expressing human DSCAML1
adhered to each other in large aggregates. Aggregation was mediated by
homophilic interactions between DSCAML1 molecules expressed on the cell
surface and did not require calcium.

Yamagata and Sanes (2008) demonstrated that 4 closely related
immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) adhesion molecules--Dscam (602523),
DscamL, Sidekick-1 (SDK1; 607216), and SDK2 (607217)--are expressed in
chick by nonoverlapping subsets of interneurons and retinal ganglion
cells that form synapses in distinct inner plexiform layer (IPL)
sublaminae. Moreover, each protein is concentrated within the
appropriate sublaminae and each mediates homophilic adhesion. Loss- and
gain-of-function studies in vivo indicated that these IgSF members
participate in determining the inner plexiform layer sublaminae in which
synaptic partners arborize and connect. Thus, vertebrate Dscams, like
Drosophila Dscams, play roles in neural connectivity. Yamagata and Sanes
(2008) concluded that, taken together, their results on Dscams and
Sidekicks suggested the existence of an IgSF code for laminar
specificity in retina and, by implication, in other parts of the central
nervous system.

GENE STRUCTURE

Agarwala et al. (2001) determined that the DSCAML1 gene contains at
least 32 exons. Barlow et al. (2002) identified 33 exons in DSCAML1.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hirosawa et al. (1999) mapped the DSCAML1
gene to chromosome 11. Using FISH, Agarwala et al. (2001) mapped the
human DSCAML1 gene to chromosome 11q23 and the mouse Dscaml1 gene to
chromosome 9B.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Fc receptor with low affinity for IgG (FCGR3, or CD16) is encoded by
2 nearly identical genes, FCGR3A (146740) and FCGR3B, resulting in
tissue-specific expression of alternative membrane-anchored isoforms.
FCGR3A encodes a transmembrane protein expressed on activated
monocytes/macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and a subset of T
cells. In contrast, FCGR3B encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored protein that is expressed constitutively by neutrophils
and after gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) stimulation by eosinophils
(summary by Gessner et al., 1995).

CLONING

Ory et al. (1989) reported the cDNA sequences encoding the NA1 and NA2
forms of FCGR3 on neutrophils, which are encoded by the FCGR3B gene.

By Western blot and flow cytometric analyses, Ravetch and Perussia
(1989) demonstrated differential expression of FCGR3 on
polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and NK cells. The glycoprotein on
NK cells (FCGR3A) had a molecular mass 6 to 10 kD larger than that on
neutrophils (FCGR3B) and was resistant to phosphatidylinositol-specific
phospholipase C. Transcripts derived from FCGR3A and FCGR3B in NK cells
and PMNs, respectively, have multiple single nucleotide differences,
including 1 that converts a termination codon to a codon encoding arg,
thereby extending the cytoplasmic domain by 21 amino acids and
introducing a transmembrane anchor for FCGR3A in NK cells. The deduced
FCGR3A protein contains 254 amino acids, whereas the deduced FCGR3B
protein contains 233 amino acids. Ravetch and Perussia (1989) concluded
that cell type-specific expression of 2 genes encoding alternative FCGR3
proteins has a significant effect on the biologic functions of the
molecules.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gessner et al. (1995) isolated and sequenced genomic clones of FCGR3A
and FCGR3B, located their transcription initiation sites, identified the
different organizations of their 5-prime regions, and demonstrated 4
distinct classes of FCGR3A transcripts compared with a single class of
FCGR3B transcripts. The gene promoters displayed different
tissue-specific transcriptional activities reflecting expression of
FCGR3A in NK cells and FCGR3B in neutrophils.

MAPPING

By spot blot analysis, Grundy et al. (1989) mapped the FCGR2A (146790)
and FCGR2B genes, which are separated by about 200 kb, to chromosome 1q.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Sondermann et al. (2000) described the crystal structures of a soluble
FCGR3 (CD16B), an Fc fragment from human IgG1 (Fc1), and their complex.
In the 1:1 complex, the receptor binds to the 2 halves of the Fc
fragment in contact with residues of the C-gamma-2 domains and the hinge
region. Upon complex formation, the angle between the 2 soluble CD16B
domains increases significantly and the Fc fragment opens
asymmetrically. The high degree of amino acid conservation between
soluble CD16B and other Fc receptors, and similarly between Fc1 and
related immunoglobulins, suggested similar structures and modes of
association.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Genetic polymorphism of Fc receptor III on neutrophils is detectable by
several means, including reaction with antibodies against the biallelic
neutrophil-specific antigen system NA; differences in electrophoretic
mobility on SDS-PAGE; and differences in mRNAs encoding the allelic
forms of Fc receptor III. Ory et al. (1989) described the relationship
between structural and antigenic polymorphisms of FCGR3B and showed that
these reflect differences at the level of primary protein structure.

In a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700), Clark et
al. (1990) found that neutrophils were not recognized by either
monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to Fc receptor III, but reacted
normally with antibodies to Fc receptor II (FCGR2A), as well as with
antibodies to complement receptor-1, complement receptor-3 (120980), and
decay-accelerating factor (DAF; 125240). Analysis of genomic DNA showed
that failure of the patient's neutrophils to express Fc receptor III was
most likely due to an abnormality of the gene encoding the receptor.

Huizinga et al. (1990) described a case of neonatal isoimmune
neutropenia in which the mother was completely lacking FcRIII (CD16) on
neutrophils, but normal expression of FcRIII on natural killer cells.
The mother had isoantibodies in her blood against CD16 antigen,
apparently produced during pregnancy and responsible for the neutropenia
in her child. Fc receptor III is encoded by 2 separate genes: FcRIII-1,
which encodes the neutrophil receptor, and FcRIII-2, which encodes the
transmembrane receptor on natural killer cells and macrophages. The
neutrophil FcRIII deficiency appeared to be due to deletion of the
FcRIII-1 gene, while the FcRIII-2 gene was normally present. Her parents
were found to be heterozygous for the defect.

Neutrophil-specific antigens have been identified in the course of study
of isoimmune neonatal neutropenia due to fetomaternal incompatibility.
(Since it occurs in multiple sibs, neonatal neutropenia might simulate a
recessive disorder.) Two loci, termed NA and NB (162860), were
identified (Lalezari and Radel, 1974), with 2 alleles known at the NA
locus. These are NA1 and NA2 and have a frequency of 0.377 and 0.633,
respectively, in Caucasians and 0.651 in 0.302, respectively, in
Japanese (Ohto and Matsuo, 1989). The 'NA-null' status of the mother
reported by Huizinga et al. (1990) indicated that CD16 and NA are the
same molecule. Fromont et al. (1992) described a healthy woman who after
multiple pregnancies developed an antibody directed against CD16 which
caused transient neonatal alloimmune neutropenia (NAIN). The woman's
polymorphonuclear leukocytes did not react with monoclonal NA1 and NA2
antibodies, indicating the NA-null phenotype. Fromont et al. (1992)
determined that in a healthy, white population of 3,377 random blood
donors there were only 4 other instances of the NA-null phenotype. Their
proposita was the only one with an allo-CD16 antibody. The gene
frequency was calculated to be 0.0274 +/- 0.0059.

The neutrophil-specific antigen NC1 was defined by an antibody (Vaz) in
the serum of a multiparous mother who gave birth to a child with
alloimmune neonatal neutropenia (Lalezari et al., 1970). This antigen
has a gene frequency of about 0.80 (Lalezari et al., 1970). NC1 was
found to be associated with the neutrophil-specific antigen NA2,
although the precise relationship of NC1 and NA2 was unclear. Using the
antigen capture assay MAIGA and the granulocyte (GIFT) and lymphocyte
(LIFT) immunofluorescence tests, Bux et al. (1995) obtained results
indicating that NC1 and NA2 antigens are identical.

Aitman et al. (2006) showed that copy number variation (CNV) of the
orthologous rat and human Fcgr3 (FCGR3A; 146740) genes is a determinant
of susceptibility to immunologically mediated glomerulonephritis.
Positional cloning identified loss of the rat-specific Fcgr3 paralog
'Fcgr3-related sequence' (Fcgr3rs) as a determinant of macrophage
overactivity and glomerulonephritis in Wistar Kyoto rats. In humans, low
copy number of FCGR3B, an ortholog of rat Fcgr3, was associated with
glomerulonephritis in the autoimmune disorder SLE. Aitman et al. (2006)
concluded that their finding that gene CNV predisposes to
immunologically mediated renal disease in 2 mammalian species provides
direct evidence for the importance of genome plasticity in the evolution
of genetically complex phenotypes, including susceptibility to common
human disease.

Following up on the study of Aitman et al. (2006) in a larger sample,
Fanciulli et al. (2007) confirmed and strengthened their previous
finding of an association between low FCGR3B copy number and
susceptibility to glomerulonephritis in SLE patients. Low copy number
was also associated with risk of systemic SLE with no known renal
involvement as well as with microscopic polyangiitis and Wegener
granulomatosis (608710), but not with organ- specific Graves disease
(275000) or Addison disease (240200), in British and French cohorts.
Fanciulli et al. (2007) concluded that low FCGR3B copy number or
complete FCGR3B deficiency has a key role in the development of specific
autoimmunity.

Willcocks et al. (2008) confirmed that low copy number of FCGR3B was
associated with SLE (152700) in a Caucasian U.K. population, but they
were unable to find an association in a Chinese population.
Investigations of the functional effects of FCGR3B CNV revealed that
FCGR3B CNV correlated with cell surface expression, soluble FCGR3B
production, and neutrophil adherence to and uptake of immune complexes
both in a patient family and in the general population. Willcocks et al.
(2008) found that individuals from 3 U.K. cohorts with antineutrophil
cytoplasmic antibody-associated systemic vasculitis (AASV) were more
likely to have high FCGR3B CNV. They proposed that FCGR3B CNV is
involved in immune complex clearance, possibly explaining the
association of low CNV with SLE and high CNV with AASV.

Among 1,115 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) and 654
controls, Robinson et al. (2012) found a significant association between
FCGR3B deletions and disease (OR = 1.50, p = 0.028). The association was
more apparent in rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive disease (OR = 1.61, p =
0.011). Robinson et al. (2012) noted that the general association (p =
0.028) would not remain significant if corrected for multiple testing,
but the evidence was strengthened by the stronger association in the
RF-positive group of patients. The level of FCGR3B expression on
neutrophils was shown to correlate with gene copy number. The results
implicated an important role for neutrophils in the pathogenesis of RA,
potentially through reduced FCGR3B-mediated immune complex clearance.
The authors used a novel quantitative sequence variant assay in the
study.

In a metaanalysis of 8 published studies examining the association of
FCGR3B CNVs in autoimmune diseases, McKinney and Merriman (2012) found
that low (less than 2) gene copy number was associated with SLE (OR of
1.59, p = 9.1 x 10(-7)), but not with rheumatoid arthritis (OR of 1.36,
p = 0.15). A combined autoimmune phenotype analysis, including
vasculitis, ulcerative colitis (see 266600), Kawasaki disease (611775),
and other disorders, supported FCGR3B deletions as a risk factor for
non-organ-specific autoimmunity (OR = 1.44, p = 2.9 x 10(-9)). The
findings implicated defects in the clearance of immune complexes in the
etiology of non-organ-specific autoimmune disease.

Mueller et al. (2013) found that the increased risk of SLE associated
with reduced copy number of FCGR3B can be explained by the presence of a
chimeric gene, FCGR2B-prime, that occurs as a consequence of FCGR3B
deletion on FCGR3B zero-copy haplotypes. The FCGR2B-prime gene consists
of upstream elements and a 5-prime coding region that derive from FCGR2C
(612169), and a 3-prime coding region that derives from FCGR2B (604590).
The coding sequence of FCGR2B-prime is identical to that of FCGR2B, but
FCGR2B-prime would be expected to be under the control of 5-prime
flanking sequences derived from FCGR2C. Mueller et al. (2013) found by
flow cytometry, immunoblotting, and cDNA sequencing that presence of the
chimeric FCGR2B-prime gene results in the ectopic presence of
Fc-gamma-RIIb on natural killer cells, providing an explanation for SLE
risk associated with reduced FCGR3B copy number. To pursue the
underlying mechanism of SLE disease association with FCGR3B copy number
variation, Mueller et al. (2013) aligned the reference sequence (GRCh37)
of the proximal block of the FCGR locus (chr1:161,480,906-161,564,008)
to that of the distal block (chr1:161,562,570-161,645,839).
Identification of informative paralogous sequence variants (PSVs)
enabled Mueller et al. (2013) to narrow the potential breakpoint region
to a 24.5-kb region of paralogy between then 2 ancestral duplicated
blocks. The complete absence of nonpolymorphic PSVs in the 24.5-kb
region prevented more precise localization of the breakpoints in
FCGR3B-deleted or FCGR3B-duplicated haplotypes.

EVOLUTION

By determining the nature and rate of copy number variation (CNV)
mutation and investigating the global variation of disease-associated
variation at the FCGR locus, Machado et al. (2012) determined that CNV
of the FCGR3 genes is mediated by recurrent nonallelic homologous
recombination between the 2 segmental duplications that carry FCGR3A and
FCGR3B. They showed that pathogen richness, particularly helminth
pathogens, is likely to have influenced the patterns of variation in
FCGRs in humans. Machado et al. (2012) proposed that alterations to IgG
binding in the context of helminth infection have driven positive
selection in FCGR among different mammalian species, linking
evolutionary pressure of helminth infection with autoimmune disease via
adaptation at the genetic level. This model supports the 'hygiene
hypothesis,' which states that in the absence of chronic helminth
infection in modern populations, previously selected alleles respond to
immune system challenges differently and therefore may alter
susceptibility to autoimmune disease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) found that Fcrg (FCER1G; 147139) -/-
mice showed reduced mortality in an acute peritonitis model caused by
cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) compared with wildtype mice. The
reduced mortality in Fcrg -/- mice was associated with lower serum and
peritoneal Tnf (191160) and significantly increased capacity of
neutrophils and macrophages to phagocytose E. coli. Mice lacking Fcgr3
(the only Fcgr3 gene in mice) also had reduced sepsis after CLP. Fcgr3
bound E. coli, inducing Fcrg phosphorylation, recruitment of tyrosine
phosphatase Shp1 (PTPN6; 176883), and dephosphorylation of
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K; see 171834). Decreased Pi3k
activity inhibited E. coli phagocytosis and increased Tnf production
through Tlr4 (603030). Confocal microscopy demonstrated negative
regulation of Marco (604870) by Fcrg. Interaction of E. coli with Fcgr3
induced recruitment of Shp1 to Marco and inhibited E. coli phagocytosis.
Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) concluded that binding of E. coli to
FCGR3 triggers an inhibitory FCRG pathway that impairs MARCO-mediated
bacterial clearance and activates TNF secretion.

Ory et al. (1989) found nucleotide changes in the FCGR3B gene predicting
4 amino acid differences between the NA1 and NA2 alloantigens of
neutrophils involved in alloimmune neonatal neutropenia. As a result,
NA1 FCGR3 has only 4 potential N-linked glycosylation sites compared
with 6 in NA2 FCGR3. In addition, Ory et al. (1989) found a silent
nucleotide change at codon 38: CTC (leu38) in NA1; CTT (leu38) in NA2.

611993	TITLE *611993 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S33; MRPS33
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPS33
is a component of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human MRPS33. The deduced 106-amino acid MRPS33 protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 12.6 kD. Removal of a predicted 26-amino
acid N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal results in a mature
9.7-kD protein. Koc et al. (2001) identified MRPS33 orthologs in mouse,
Drosophila, and C. elegans, but not in yeast or E. coli. Mouse and human
MRPS33 share 80.2% amino acid identity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang and Gerstein (2003) determined that the MRPS33 gene has no introns
in its coding region.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang and Gerstein (2003) mapped the
MRPS33 gene to chromosome 7q32-q34. They identified 4 MRPS33 pseudogenes
scattered throughout the genome.

BETA-TRACE;;
LIPOCALIN-TYPE PROSTAGLANDIN D SYNTHASE; LPGDS;;
PROSTAGLANDIN D SYNTHASE, LIPOCALIN-TYPE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) functions as a neuromodulator and/or trophic
factor in the central nervous system. Glutathione (GSH)-independent PGD
synthase catalyzes the conversion of prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) to PGD2 in
the presence of various sulfhydryl compounds. The enzyme is responsible
for biosynthesis of PGD2 in the brain (Nagata et al., 1991).

CLONING

Nagata et al. (1991) isolated cDNAs for GSH-independent PGD2 synthase
from cDNA libraries of human brain. The longest insert contained a
coding region of 570 basepairs corresponding to 190 amino acid residues
with a calculated molecular mass of 21,016.

GENE FUNCTION

Tanaka et al. (1997) analyzed the binding of recombinant rat brain Ptgds
to retinoids by measuring fluorescence, UV, and circular dichroism
spectra after incubation of Ptgds with various isoforms of retinoid.
They found that Ptgds binds all-trans-retinoic acid, 9-cis-retinoic
acid, all-trans-retinal, and 13-cis-retinal, but not all-trans-retinol,
with affinities sufficient for function as a retinoid transporter.
All-trans-retinoic acid inhibited Ptgds activity in a noncompetitive
manner, suggesting that it binds to the same hydrophobic pocket as PGH2,
the substrate for Ptgds, but at a different site in this pocket. Tanaka
et al. (1997) suggested that PTGDS is a bifunctional protein that acts
as both a retinoid transporter and a PGD2-producing enzyme.

Kanekiyo et al. (2007) detected PTGDS within amyloid plaques in the
brain of a human patient with late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300)
and in mouse models of AD. In vitro studies showed that human PTGDS
inhibited the aggregation of beta-amyloid (APP; 104760) fibrils in a
dose-dependent manner. Ptgds-knockout mice showed acceleration of brain
beta-amyloid deposition, and transgenic mice overexpressing human PTGDS
showed decreased amyloid deposition, compared to wildtype. Since PTGDS
is present in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), Kanekiyo et al. (2007)
concluded that PTGDS acts as an endogenous beta-amyloid chaperone by
binding to a particular area of APP and preventing a conformational
shape change from soluble to insoluble peptides. The findings suggested
that quantitative or qualitative changes in PTGDS may be involved in the
pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.

Both SRY (480000) and SOX9 (608160) are necessary for testis development
in humans and mice. Prostaglandin D2 contributes to the development of
the testis by recruiting cells of the supporting cell lineage to a
Sertoli cell fate (Wilhelm et al., 2005). Wilhelm et al. (2007) found
that Pgds was expressed in embryonic mouse Sertoli cells immediately
after the onset of Sry and Sox9 expression. Pgds upregulation was
mediated by Sox9, but not Sry, and required the binding of dimeric Sox9
to a paired SOX recognition site within the Pgds 5-prime flanking
region.

GENE STRUCTURE

White et al. (1992) isolated the PTGDS gene from a genomic library. It
spans 3,600 bp and contains 7 exons. The transcriptional start site was
mapped to a G residue 74 bp 5-prime of the ATG initiation codon. A TATA
box-like element (ATAAATA) was situated 21 bp upstream of the mRNA start
site. The gene for PGDS had a close structural resemblance to those for
murine major urinary protein (MUP) and ovine beta-lactoglobulin.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), White et al. (1992)
localized the PGDS2 gene to 9q34.2-q34.3. By dual-color FISH, they
demonstrated the following order: cen--HXB (187380)--ABL
(189980)--PGDS--tel. Southern blot analysis indicated that there is a
single copy of the gene in the haploid genome.

By linkage analyses in an interspecific backcross progeny in the mouse,
Chan et al. (1994) mapped the Ptgds gene to chromosome 2 in a region of
homology to human 9q34 and in the same region as other genes of the
lipocalin family. By interspecific backcross linkage analysis, Pilz et
al. (1995) mapped the Ptgds gene to mouse chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Miwa et al. (2004) identified 6 SNPs in the LPGDS gene in a Japanese
population, including a common 4111A-C SNP in the 3-prime UTR. Serum
levels of high density lipoprotein were significantly higher in
individuals with the AA genotype of 4111A-C compared with those with the
AC or CC genotypes. The maximum intima-media thickness in the common
carotid artery (CIMT-max) was significantly smaller in subjects with the
AA genotype than in those with AC or CC. Logistic regression analysis
revealed that the presence of the AA genotype significantly reduced the
risk for increased CIMT-max, even after adjustment for other risk
factors. Miwa et al. (2004) concluded that the 4111A-C SNP in the LPGDS
gene contributes to development of carotid atherosclerosis in Japanese
hypertensive patients.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pinzar et al. (2000) noted that PGD2 is the most abundant prostanoid
produced in the central nervous system of mammals and one of the most
potent sleep-inducing substances. It induces excess sleep in rats and
monkeys after intracerebral ventricular infusion. Sleep induced by PGD2
is indistinguishable from physiologic sleep, as judged by
electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), brain temperature,
locomotor activities, heart rate, and general behavior of animals (Onoe
et al., 1988). PGD2 is produced in the arachidonic acid cascade from a
common precursor of various prostanoids, PGH2, by the action of PTGDS.
In the CNS, PGDS is produced mainly in the leptomeninges and choroid
plexus and secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid as beta-trace, the
second most abundant protein in CSF after albumin. To examine the
function of PTGDS, as well as endogenously produced PGD2 in sleep
regulation in vivo, Pinzar et al. (2000) generated transgenic mice that
overexpressed the human PTGDS gene to study their sleep behavior.
Although no differences were observed in the sleep/wake patterns between
wildtype and transgenic mice, a striking time-dependent increase in
nonrapid eye movement (NREM), but not in rapid eye movement (REM), sleep
was observed in 2 independent lines of transgenic mice after stimulation
by tail clipping. Concomitantly, the spontaneous locomotor activity of
transgenic mice was drastically decreased in response to the tail clip.
Induction of NREM sleep in transgenic mice was positively correlated
with the PGD2 production in the brain. Sleep, locomotion, and PGD2
content were essentially unchanged in wildtype mice after tail clipping.
The results demonstrated the involvement of the PTGDS gene in the
regulation of NREM sleep. Thus, the PTGDS gene appears to be responsible
for the regulation of NREM sleep, in contrast to the orexin/hypocretin
gene (HCRT; 602358), which is involved in the pathogenesis of narcolepsy
and possibly in the regulation of REM sleep.

Ragolia et al. (2005) found that Lpgds-knockout mice became glucose
intolerant and insulin resistant at an accelerated rate compared with
controls. Adipocytes were significantly larger in Lpgds-knockout mice
compared with controls on the same diets. Cell culture data revealed
significant differences between insulin-stimulated MAP kinase
phosphatase-2 (DUSP4; 602747), protein tyrosine phosphatase-1D (PTPN21;
603271), and phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (PTK2; 600758)
expression levels in Lpgds-knockout vascular smooth muscle cells and
controls. Only Lpgds-knockout mice developed nephropathy and an aortic
thickening reminiscent of the early stages of atherosclerosis when fed a
'diabetogenic' diet.

Qu et al. (2006) found that selenium tetrachloride (SeCl4), an inhibitor
of prostaglandin D synthase, inhibited sleep in wildtype mice
dose-dependently and immediately after administration. SeCl4-induced
insomnia was observed in hematopoietic Pgds (HPGDS; 602598)-knockout
mice, but not in Lpgds-knockout mice, Lpgds/Hpgds double-knockout mice,
or prostaglandin D receptor (PTGDR; 604687)-knockout mice.
Administration of a Ptgdr antagonist reduced sleep of rats by 30%.

Philibert et al. (2013) found that 24% of Ptgds -/- mice and 16% of
Ptgds +/- mice presented with random unilateral undescended testes. All
other parts of the male reproductive system appeared normal. The
undescended testis located cranially to the inguinal canal in a
suprascrotal position. The phenotype was accompanied by decreased Rxfp2
(606655) mRNA expression in the gubernaculum and was similar to that
observed in mice with conditional inactivation of androgen receptor (AR;
313700) in the gubernaculum.

611864	TITLE *611864 ARMADILLO REPEAT-CONTAINING 10; ARMC10
;;SPLICING VARIANT INVOLVED IN HEPATOCARCINOGENESIS; SVH
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By representational difference analysis, followed by database analysis,
and screening a hepatoma cell line cDNA library, Huang et al. (2003)
cloned ARMC10, which they called SVH. The deduced 343-amino acid protein
contains an armadillo repeat, an N-terminal cell attachment sequence, an
N-terminal transmembrane domain, and 3 PKC and 6 casein kinase II
phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected a major 2.6-kb
transcript in all tissues tested with high expression in placenta,
liver, kidney, heart, and brain. RT-PCR analysis identified 4 splice
variants, resulting from alternative splicing of exons 2 and 5, which
they designated SVHA, SVHB, SVHC, and SVHD. Confocal microscopy and
immunofluorescence studies localized all splice variants to the
endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and the N-terminal transmembrane domain
was required for ER subcellular localization. Quantitative RT-PCR showed
that only SVHB, which lacks exon 2, was upregulated in hepatocellular
carcinoma samples.

GENE FUNCTION

Huang et al. (2003) showed that overexpression of the SVHB variant
accelerated cell growth in a normal liver cell line and promoted tumor
formation in nude mice. Antisense inhibition of SVHB mRNA decreased cell
growth and induced apoptosis in a hepatoma cell line.

GENE STRUCTURE

Huang et al. (2003) determined that the ARMC10 gene contains 7 exons
spanning approximately 25 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Huang et al. (2003) mapped the ARMC10 gene
to chromosome 7q11.2.

610378	TITLE *610378 GLIS FAMILY ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 1; GLIS1
;;GLI-SIMILAR PROTEIN 1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GLIS1 is a GLI (165220)-related Kruppel-like zinc finger protein that
functions as an activator and repressor of transcription (Kim et al.,
2002).

CLONING

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis with the ligand-binding domain of nuclear
orphan receptor ROR-gamma (RORC; 602943) as bait, Kim et al. (2002)
obtained a partial Glis1 cDNA from a mouse lymphoma cDNA library. Using
this fragment to screen a mouse kidney cDNA library, followed by PCR and
5-prime RACE, they cloned full-length Glis1. The deduced 789-amino acid
protein contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal, a proline-rich
region, and a zinc finger domain consisting of 5 tandem C2H2-type zinc
finger motifs. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected highest
expression of Glis1 in placenta and kidney, lower expression in testis,
and little expression in other tissues examined. RT-PCR analysis
detected high expression in kidney, low expression in brain, colon,
brown fat, testis, and thymus, and no expression in lung, spleen, liver,
pancreas, and muscle, In situ hybridization of mouse embryos showed that
Glis1 was expressed primarily in the mesodermal lineages, including
craniofacial regions, branchial arches, somites, vibrissal and hair
follicles, limb buds, and myotomes. By confocal microscopy of monkey
kidney fibroblast CV1 cells expressing full-length and mutant mouse
Glis1, Kim et al. (2002) localized Glis1 to the nucleus in a speckled
pattern similar to that observed for many transcription factors.

GENE FUNCTION

By EMSA analysis, Kim et al. (2002) showed that mouse Glis1 is able to
bind oligonucleotides containing the Gli-binding site consensus
sequence.

Using monohybrid and deletion analyses, Kim et al. (2002) showed that
Glis1 contains a strong activation domain in the C terminus and a
repressor domain in the N terminus. Glis1-mediated transactivation
activity varied among different cell lines tested, and Kim et al. (2002)
suggested that these differences may be related to different levels of
expression or activation of Glis1 coactivators. By cotransfection of
Glis1 and CaMKiV (CAMK4; 114080), Kim et al. (2002) showed that CAMK4
stimulates Glis1 transactivation activity.

By in situ hybridization analysis, Nakanishi et al. (2006) showed that
Glis1 mRNA is not expressed in normal human epidermis or in normal mouse
skin, but is highly induced in the epidermis of psoriatic patients and
in PMA-treated mouse skin. GLIS1 expression was undetectable in human
epidermal keratinocytes but increased significantly after treatment with
proinflammatory agents PMA or interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570). PMA
induction of GLIS1 expression was cell type-specific and confined to
cell types in which PMA induction is accompanied by cell
differentiation. Nakanishi et al. (2006) showed that in human
keratinocytes immortalized by HPV-E6, full-length mouse Glis1 localized
to the cytoplasm and a C-terminal truncated form of Glis1 that retains
the zinc finger domain localized to the nucleus. By microarray analysis
of a human epidermal keratinocyte cell line expressing the C-terminal
truncated form of mouse Glis1, Nakanishi et al. (2006) found that Glis1
induced several genes known to be differentially regulated during
epidermal differentiation, including S100A9 (123886), KLK7 (604438),
SPRR/cornifin (SPRR1B; 182266), involucrin (IVL; 147360), and
transglutaminase-1 (TGM1; 190195). Nakanishi et al. (2006) suggested
that Glis1 may play a role in the aberrant differentiation observed in
psoriatic epidermis.

Maekawa et al. (2011) showed that Glis1 markedly enhances the generation
of induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) from both mouse and human
fibroblasts when it is expressed together with Oct3/4 (164177), Sox2
(184429), and Klf4 (602253). Mouse IPSCs generated using this
combination of transcription factors can form germline-competent
chimeras. Glis1 is enriched in unfertilized oocytes and in embryos at
the 1-cell stage. DNA microarray analyses show that Glis1 promotes
multiple pro-reprogramming pathways, including Myc (190080), Nanog
(607937), Lin28 (611043), Wnt (see 606359), Esrrb (602167), and the
mesenchymal-epithelial transition. Maekawa et al. (2011) concluded that
Glis1 effectively promotes the direct reprogramming of somatic cells
during iPSC generation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GLIS1
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SHGC-34268). By FISH, Kim et al. (2002)
mapped the mouse Glis1 gene to chromosome 4C6.

VACUOLAR PROTON PUMP, SUBUNIT 1; VPP1
DESCRIPTION ATP-driven proton pumps associated with the clathrin-coated vesicles and
synaptic vesicles are a group of polypeptides involved in basic cellular
processes through acidification of intracellular organelles. These
functions include intracellular targeting of enzymes to lysosomes and
secretory granules, and receptor-ligand dissociation in
receptor-mediated endocytosis. Eight or 9 polypeptides had been
identified from clathrin-coated vesicles. Using a rat cDNA clone for the
116-kD subunit of the vacuolar proton pump, Ozcelik et al. (1991) mapped
the gene to human chromosome 17 by study of rodent-human hybrid cell
lines and the homologous gene to mouse chromosome 11 by a study of
Chinese hamster or rat/mouse hybrid cell lines. In hybrid cell lines
with fragments of chromosome 17, the VPP1 gene was shown to be located
in region 17q21-qter.

In the course of constructing a transcription map of approximately 600
kb of genomic DNA surrounding the BRCA1 (113705) gene, Brody et al.
(1995) identified the VPP1 gene, thus regionalizing it to 17q21.

;;DNAX-ACTIVATION PROTEIN 10; DAP10
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Many immune receptors are composed of separate ligand-binding and
signal-transducing subunits. In natural killer (NK) and T cells, Wu et
al. (1999) identified DAP10 as a cell surface adaptor protein in an
activating receptor complex with NKG2D (602893), a receptor for the
stress-inducible and tumor-associated major histocompatibility complex
molecule MICA (600169). Wu et al. (1999) identified an EST with homology
to DAP12 (TYROBP; 604142). The DAP10 cDNA encodes a 93-amino acid type I
membrane protein. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses detected DAP10
expression as an approximately 500-kb transcript primarily in
hematopoietic cells. Protein immunoblot analysis revealed multiple bands
migrating more slowly than the predicted 10 kD, primarily due to
O-linked glycosylation. Within the DAP10 cytoplasmic domain, an SH2
domain-binding site was capable of recruiting the p85 subunit of the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (see 171833), providing for
NKG2D-dependent transduction. Thus, NKG2D-DAP10 receptor complexes may
activate NK and T-cell responses against MICA-bearing tumors.
Cotransfection of Flag-DAP10 and NKG2D resulted in surface expression of
both proteins, whereas alone they were minimally expressed. Wu et al.
(1999) concluded that the finding that NKG2D-DAP10 complex is a receptor
for the nonclassical MHC class I molecule MICA and evidence that these
molecules are stress-inducible and broadly expressed in epithelial
tumors suggest that the activating NKG2D-DAP10 complex may be involved
in innate immune surveillance.

GENE FUNCTION

Billadeau et al. (2003) noted that DAP10, which is associated with
NKG2D, lacks an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in
its cytoplasmic tail. They identified a crucial tyr-ile-asn-met motif in
the DAP10 cytoplasmic tail that couples receptor stimulation to
downstream activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, VAV1 (164875),
Rho family GTPases (see 165390), and phospholipase C (see 600220).
Billadeau et al. (2003) concluded that activation of NKG2D-DAP10
proceeds independently of Syk family protein tyrosine kinases (see
600085) and ITAM-containing subunits, but it is capable of initiating
signals that induce killing.

MAPPING

Wu et al. (1999) reported that the human HCST gene resides on chromosome
19q13.1 in opposite transcriptional orientation to the DAP12 gene. The 2
genes are separated by 130 basepairs.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gilfillan et al. (2002) showed that CD8-positive T cells from
Dap10-deficient mice lacked Nkg2d expression and were unable to mount
tumor-specific responses. In contrast, NK cells from these animals
expressed a functional Nkg2d receptor through association with another
adaptor molecule, Dap12, which recruited protein tyrosine kinases.

;;KIAA0940
CPEB3 RIBOZYME, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned CPEB3, which they designated
KIAA0940. RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression in brain, intermediate
expression in kidney, heart, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, testis,
ovary, pancreas, and fetal liver, and low expression in spleen and fetal
brain. CPEB3 was expressed in all specific adult brain regions examined,
with highest levels in amygdala and substantia nigra.

Salehi-Ashtiani et al. (2006) stated that CPEB3 transcripts use 2
alternate untranslated first exons, one expressed in liver and testis,
and the other expressed in brain. The 698-amino acid CPEB3 protein has
an N-terminal glutamine-rich domain, followed by 2 RNA recognition
motifs and a C-terminal zinc finger domain. The glutamine-rich domain is
not present in other CPEBs.

- CPEB3 Ribozyme

Using an in vitro self-selection technique, Salehi-Ashtiani et al.
(2006) identified self-cleaving ribozymes associated with olfactory
receptor OR4K15, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R; 147370),
a LINE-1 retrotransposon (see LRE1; 151626), and CPEB3. The CPEB3
ribozyme is located within intron 3 and is structurally related to
ribozymes from human hepatitis delta virus (HDV), a single-stranded RNA
satellite virus for hepatitis B infection (see 610424). EST database
analysis and RT-PCR of human and mouse total RNA extracts indicated that
the CPEB3 ribozyme is expressed and self-cleaves in vivo.
Salehi-Ashtiani et al. (2006) identified the CPEB3 ribozyme only in
mammalian vertebrates. They proposed that HDV ribozymes and the CPEB3
ribozyme are evolutionarily related, and that HDV arose from the human
transcriptome.

GENE FUNCTION

- CPEB3 Ribozyme

Salehi-Ashtiani et al. (2006) narrowed the active sequence of the CPEB3
ribozyme to 81 nucleotides. This 81-nucleotide construct cleaved to
produce a 9-nucleotide upstream fragment containing a 2-prime-to-3-prime
cyclic phosphate, and a 72-nucleotide downstream fragment containing a
5-prime terminal hydroxyl that could be phosphorylated with
polynucleotide kinase (PNKP; 605610). The ribozyme had a low Mg(2+)
requirement, and was also active in the presence of Mn(2+) and Ca(2+).
Ribozyme activity was almost constant between pH 5.5 and 8.5, suggesting
the presence of 2 functional groups.

GENE STRUCTURE

Salehi-Ashtiani et al. (2006) reported that the CPEB3 gene spans 242 kb
and contains 11 exons, including 2 alternatively spliced, untranslated
first exons. Intron 3 spans 46 kb and contains a ribozyme.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the CPEB3 gene
to chromosome 10.

DILUTE, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Engle and Kennett (1994) cloned the human homolog of the mouse 'dilute'
gene, MYO5A. They suggested Griscelli syndrome (see 214450) and
neuroectodermal melanolysosomal disease (256710) as candidates for
mutations in the myoxin gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Several findings indicate that class V myosins perform multiple
functions within the cell. Espreafico et al. (1998) used a green
fluorescent protein (GFP) tag to characterize myosin V localization in
cultured mammalian cells and in primary cultures of rat hippocampus. In
all cells investigated, myosin V immunoreactivity was associated with
the centrosome. In interphase cells, myosin V was found in
pericentriolar material, and in both mother and daughter centrioles.
During cell division, myosin V staining was intense throughout the
cytoplasm and was concentrated in a trail between migrating centrioles
and in the mitotic spindle poles and spindle fibers. The consistent
association of myosin V with the centrosome was observed at all stages
of the cell cycle by all methods used. Espreafico et al. (1998) noted
that melanocytes isolated from 'dilute lethal' mice divide at half the
rate of melanocytes isolated from wildtype mice. They suggested that
myosin V function in the centrosome of human lymphocytes may be
essential either for cellular proliferation or for the polarized
movement of the centrosome that occurs during T-killer or T-helper cell
response.

Mehta et al. (1999) demonstrated that myosin V is a processive motor.
Processivity means that the motor undergoes multiple catalytic cycles
and coupled mechanical advances for each diffusional encounter with its
track. This allows single motors to support movement of an organelle
along its track. Mehta et al. (1999) provided direct evidence that
myosin V is a processive actin-based motor that can move in large steps
approximating the 36-nm pseudo-repeat of the actin filament. Rief et al.
(2000) provided a molecular model for myosin V processivity. The
findings of Rief et al. (2000) were discussed by Yanagida and Iwane
(2000).

Myosin V has heads of about 31 nm that could span the 36-nm actin
helical repeat and thus allow single 2-headed molecules to transport
cargo by walking straight. Walker et al. (2000) used electron microscopy
to show that while working, myosin V spans the helical repeat. The heads
are mostly 13 actin subunits apart, with values of 11 or 15 also found.
Typically the structure is polar and one head is curved, the other
straighter. Single particle processing reveals the polarity of the
underlying actin filament, showing that the curved head is the leading
one. The shape of the leading head may correspond to the beginning of
the working stroke of the motor. Walker et al. (2000) also observed
molecules attached by one head in this conformation. To test Walker's
hypothesis, Tanaka et al. (2002) measured the mechanical properties of
single molecules of myosin V truncation mutants with neck domains only
one-sixth of the native length. Tanaka et al. (2002) demonstrated that
the processivity and step distance along actin are both similar to those
of full-length myosin V. Thus, Tanaka et al. (2002) concluded that the
long neck domain is not essential for either the large steps or
processivity of myosin V. Their results challenged the lever-arm model.

El-Husseini and Vincent (1999) determined that an endogenous
brain-expressed ring finger (RNF22; 605493) interacts with class V
myosins. The authors hypothesized that interactions between RNF22 and
class V myosins may be important in organelle transport and neurite
outgrowth.

Fukuda et al. (2002) characterized the interaction between mouse MyoVa
and Rab27a (603868) in their studies of pigment granule transport. By
deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, they determined that
melanophilin (606526) interacts with both proteins. The tripartite
protein complex could be immunoprecipitated from mouse melanocytes.

Organelle transport by myosin V is downregulated during mitosis,
presumably by myosin V phosphorylation. Karcher et al. (2001) used mass
spectrometry phosphopeptide mapping to show that the tail of myosin V
was phosphorylated in mitotic Xenopus egg extract on a single serine
residue localized in the carboxyl-terminal organelle-binding domain.
Phosphorylation resulted in the release of the motor from the organelle.
The phosphorylation site matched the consensus sequence of
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK2; see 114078), and
inhibitors of CAMK2 prevented myosin V release.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Forkey et al. (2003) reported 3-dimensional measurements of the
structural dynamics of the light chain domain of brain myosin V using a
single-molecule fluorescence polarization technique that determines the
orientation of individual protein domains with 20- to 40-ms time
resolution. Single fluorescent calmodulin (see 114180) light chains
tilted back and forth between 2 well-defined angles as the myosin
molecule processively translocated along actin. These results provided
evidence for lever arm rotation of the calmodulin-binding domain in
myosin V, and supported a hand-over-hand mechanism for the translocation
of double-headed myosin V molecules along actin filaments.

Myosin V is a dimeric molecular motor that moves processively on actin,
with the center of mass moving about 37 nanometers for each ATP
hydrolyzed. Yildiz et al. (2003) labeled myosin V with a single
fluorophore at different positions in the light chain domain and
measured the step size with a standard deviation of less than 1.5
nanometers, with 0.5-second temporal resolution, and observation times
of minutes. The step size alternates between 37 + 2x nanometers and 37 -
2x, where x is the distance along the direction of motion between the
dye and the midpoint between the 2 heads. Yildiz et al. (2003) concluded
that these results strongly support a hand-over-hand model of motility,
not an inchworm model.

Liu et al. (2006) showed the first 3-dimensional structure of the myosin
V inactive state. Each myosin V molecule consists of 2 heads that
contain an N-terminal motor domain followed by a lever arm that binds 6
calmodulins. The heads are followed by a coiled-coil dimerization domain
(S2) and a C-terminal globular cargo-binding domain. In the inactive
structure, bending of myosin V at the head-S2 junction places the
cargo-binding domain near the motor domain's ATP-binding pocket,
indicating that ATPase inhibition might occur through decreased rates of
nucleotide exchange. The actin-binding interfaces are unobstructed, and
the lever arm is oriented in a position typical of strong actin-binding
states. Liu et al. (2006) concluded that this structure indicates that
motor recycling after cargo delivery might occur through transport on
actively treadmilling actin filaments rather than by diffusion.

Thirumurugan et al. (2006) described the structure of folded myosin and
the role of the globular tail domains in regulating activity. Electron
microscopy showed that the 2 heads lie on either side of the tail,
contacting the globular tail domains at a lobe of the motor domain
(approximately pro117 to pro137) that contains conserved acidic side
chains, suggesting ionic interactions between motor domain and globular
tail domains. Myosin V heavy meromyosin, a constitutively active
fragment lacking the globular tail domains, was inhibited and folded by
a dimeric GST-globular tail domain fusion protein. Motility assays
revealed that at nanomolar calcium levels heavy meromyosin moves
robustly on actin filaments whereas few myosins bind or move.
Thirumurugan et al. (2006) concluded that with no cargo, the globular
tail domains bind in an intramolecular manner to the motor domains,
producing an inhibited and compact structure that binds weakly to actin
and allows the molecule to recycle towards new cargoes.

To observed under a microscope how the necks of myosin V move,
Shiroguchi and Kinosita (2007) attached a micrometer-sized rod to one of
the necks. The leading neck swings unidirectionally forward, whereas the
trailing neck, once lifted, undergoes extensive Brownian rotation in all
directions before landing on a site ahead of the leading neck. The
neck-neck joint is essentially free, and the neck motion supports a
mechanism where the active swing of the leading neck biases the random
motion of the lifted head to let it eventually land on a forward site.

MAPPING

Engle and Kennett (1994) assigned the MYO5A gene to human chromosome 15
by Southern blot analysis of a panel of human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids. The 'dilute' gene maps to mouse chromosome 9, distal to a group
of 3 loci of which the human homologs are located in the region
15q22-q26.

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and in situ hybridization, Moore et al.
(1995) mapped the MYH12 gene to 15q21, thus extending distally the
region of chromosome 15 with syntenic homology to mouse chromosome 9.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Griscelli syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized
by pigmentary dilution and either central nervous system (Griscelli
syndrome type 1, or GS1; 214450) or immunologic (GS2; 607624) defects.
Pastural et al. (1997) mapped a locus for Griscelli syndrome to 15q21 by
linkage to polymorphic markers in 3 consanguineous families and in 1
nonconsanguineous family. Pastural et al. (1997, 2000) demonstrated
mutations in the MYO5A gene in patients with GS1 (160777.0002,
160777.0003).

Anikster et al. (2002), Menasche et al. (2002), Huizing et al. (2002),
and Bahadoran et al. (2003, 2003) suggested that Elejalde syndrome
(256710) in some patients and GS1 represent the same entity.

In a patient with hypopigmentation without any immunologic or neurologic
manifestations (Griscelli syndrome type 3, 609227), Menasche et al.
(2003) identified a homozygous deletion of the F-exon of the MYO5A gene
(160777.0004).

ANIMAL MODEL

In the mouse, hundreds of 'dilute' mutations have been identified and
analyzed, making the 'dilute' locus one of the best characterized
genetically of all mammalian loci. The recessive 'dilute' (d) coat color
mutation carried by many inbred strains of mice produces a lightening of
coat color, caused by an abnormal adendritic melanocyte morphology that
results in an uneven release of pigment granules into the developing
hair shaft (Russell, 1949; Markert and Silvers, 1956). Most 'dilute'
alleles also produce a neurologic defect characterized by convulsions
and opisthotonos, apparent at 8 to 10 days of age, and continuing until
the death of the animal at 2 to 3 weeks of age. Jenkins et al. (1981)
discovered that the original 'dilute' allele was the result of the
integration of an ecotropic murine leukemia provirus. Copeland et al.
(1983) and Strobel et al. (1990) cloned genomic DNA of the 'dilute'
locus and Mercer et al. (1991) studied cDNA from the 'dilute' locus. The
predicted amino acid sequence of the gene product indicated that
'dilute' encodes a novel type of myosin heavy chain, with a C-terminal
region that has elements of both type II (alpha-helical coiled-coil) and
type I (non-coiled-coil) myosin heavy chains. 'Dilute' transcripts were
differentially expressed in both embryonic and adult tissues and were
abundant in neurons of the central nervous system, cephalic ganglia, and
spinal ganglia. The results suggested an important role for the gene
product called myoxin in the elaboration, maintenance, or function of
cellular processes of melanocytes and neurons.

The 'flailer' (flr) mouse exhibits a phenotype consisting of frequent
falling, convulsive limb movements (leg flailing), and ataxia persistent
into adulthood. The phenotype is similar to that of homozygotes for null
alleles of Myo5a. Jones et al. (2000) determined that the flailer mouse
expresses a novel gene combining the promoter and first 2 exons of
guanine nucleotide-binding protein beta-5 (GNB5; 604447) with the
C-terminal exons of the closely linked myosin-5A (MyoVA) gene (Myo5a).
Biochemical and genetic studies indicated that the flailer protein,
which is expressed predominantly in brain, competes with wildtype MyoVA
in vivo, preventing the localization of smooth endoplasmic reticulum
vesicles in the dendritic spines of cerebellar Purkinje cells. The
flailer protein thus has a dominant-negative mechanism of action with a
recessive mode of inheritance due to the dependence of competitive
binding on the ratio between mutant and wildtype proteins. The
chromosomal arrangement of Myo5a upstream of Gnb5 is consistent with
nonhomologous recombination as the mutational mechanism.

GRISCELLI SYNDROME, TYPE 1
MYO5A, 2332C-T

Pastural et al. (1997) found a homozygous C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 2332, resulting in premature termination and presumptive
truncation of the polypeptide at codon 779, in a girl with presumed
Griscelli syndrome (214450). The patient did not suffer from recurrent
infections, although she displayed the characteristic pigmentary
dilution. In addition, she had had marked motor developmental delay with
hypotonia and mental retardation since the age of 3 months. The family
was from Turkey and the parents were consanguineous. The truncated
protein was predicted to lack the last 1,078 amino acids.

Anikster et al. (2002) suggested that the patients of Pastural et al.
(1997) and other patients with primary central nervous system
complications and MYO5A mutations have not Griscelli syndrome but the
related disorder neuroectodermal melanolysosomal disease (256710). They
offered several lines of evidence to support their thesis.

4634, corresponding to residue 1545, that predicted a truncated protein
lacking most of the globular domain.

2,439-bp deletion spanning the entire F-exon of the MYO5A gene,
including part of the flanking 5-prime and 3-prime intronic sequences.
Microscopic analysis of the patient's hair shafts revealed large clumps
of pigment, a characteristic feature of Griscelli syndrome, but the
patient had no immunologic or neurologic symptoms at 8 years of
follow-up.

140750	TITLE *140750 SUPPRESSOR OF TUMORIGENICITY 5; ST5
;;HELA TUMOR SUPPRESSION; HTS1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The tumorigenicity of HeLa cells in nude mice can be suppressed by the
addition of a normal human chromosome 11 in somatic cell hybrids
(Stanbridge, 1976; Klinger, 1980); see 191181 for description of a
tumor-suppressor gene located on 11q. Lichy et al. (1992) isolated a
HeLa cell line that displayed morphologic features of the nontumorigenic
hybrids, demonstrated reduced tumorigenicity in nude mice, and showed an
85% reduction in alkaline phosphatase, a consistent marker of the
tumorigenic phenotype in these cells. This cell line, designated F2,
contained a single exogenous cDNA, which was recovered by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) and designated HTS1 because of its probable
association with 'HeLa tumor suppression.' In nontumorigenic hybrids,
RNA species of 2.8, 3.1, and 4.6 kb were identified. In 2 tumorigenic
hybrid lines, the 2.8-kb species was markedly reduced or absent. Whereas
3 nontumorigenic human keratinocyte lines expressed all 3 RNA species,
several tumorigenic cervical carcinoma cell lines lacked the 2.8-kb
species.

Gohring et al. (2010) noted that the ST5 gene encodes 3 isoforms with
all 3 isoforms containing a C-terminal DENN domain but only isoforms 1
and 3 containing an ABL1-interacting domain. Quantitative PCR analysis
detected a relatively uniform ST5 expression pattern in human fetal
tissue. Expression in most human adult tissue was lower than in
corresponding fetal tissues; however, adult expression was 2.5 to 3-fold
higher in adult brain, kidney, and skeletal muscle compared to fetal
tissue. In situ hybridization analysis of mouse embryos showed that St5
was expressed in neuroepithelium of the midbrain, telencephalon, and
hindbrain, and later in the ventricular and marginal zone of the frontal
cortex. Adult mice showed St5 expression in the cerebellum and
hippocampus. Expression was also found in the heart and tubular
structures of the kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gohring et al. (2010) noted that the ST5 gene contains at least 23 exons
spanning 207.6 kb and that the first 4 exons are noncoding.

MAPPING

Lichy et al. (1992) localized the HTS1 gene to 11p15 by in situ
hybridization, confirming the assignment to chromosome 11 by somatic
cell hybrid analysis. They reviewed previous evidence indicating the
presence of a tumor suppressor gene in the 11p15 region; see 194071 and
185440.

By genomic sequence analysis, Amid et al. (2001) mapped the ST5 gene to
chromosome 11p15.3. They mapped the mouse St5 gene to distal chromosome
7 in a region that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome
11p15.3. In both genomes, ST5 lies telomeric to the CEGF1 gene and
centromeric to the LMO1 gene (186921).

CYTOGENETICS

Gohring et al. (2010) reported a boy, first seen at age 3.5-years, with
severe mental retardation, hypotonia, seizures, and sensorineural
hearing loss associated with a de novo t(11;20)(p15.4;q13.2)
translocation that interrupted the ST5 gene. Dysmorphic facial features
included high forehead, high-arched and laterally placed eyebrows,
narrow upslanting palpebral fissures, mild hypertelorism, broad
glabella, small mouth with thin upper lip, cleft palate, broad nasal
bridge, and hypoplastic nasal wings. Other features included persistent
ductus arteriosus, unilateral cystic kidney dysplasia, and frequent
infections. At age 7 years, he could walk with orthoses but had no
speech development. He was born of healthy, unrelated parents who did
not carry the translocation. Breakpoint analysis showed that the
chromosome 11 breakpoint was in intron 4 in the 5-prime untranslated
region of the ST5 gene, before the first coding exon 5. This was
predicted to separate the complete coding sequence of the gene from its
promoter region. The breakpoint on chromosome 20 did not occur in any
known genes. Screening of the ST5 gene in 220 additional patients with
mental retardation did not identify pathogenic mutations.

607240	TITLE *607240 SET DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 8; SETD8
;;SET8;;
PR/SET DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 7; PR/SET7;;
PR/SET07;;
HISTONE H4-LYSINE 20-SPECIFIC METHYLTRANSFERASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SETD8 is a lysine methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.43) that predominantly
monomethylates lysine-20 (K20) of histone H4 (see 602822). Through its
methyltransferase activity, SETD8 influences transcriptional regulation,
heterochromatin formation, genomic stability, cell cycle progression,
and development (Yang et al., 2012).

CLONING

By purifying histone H4 lysine methyltransferase activity from HeLa cell
nuclear lysates, followed by peptide sequencing, database analysis, and
PCR of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Nishioka et al. (2002) cloned SETD8,
which they designated PR/SET7. The deduced 322-amino acid protein has a
C-terminal SET domain but lacks pre- and post-SET domains found in other
histone methyltransferases. Database analysis revealed orthologs of
SETD8 in worms, flies, and vertebrates, but not in lower eukaryotes.

Yang et al. (2012) showed that full-length SET8 contains 352 amino
acids; the SET domain encompasses amino acids 216 through 343.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the SETD8 gene to chromosome 12q24.31 based on an
alignment of the SETD8 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF287261) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Nishioka et al. (2002) showed that a mutation in Drosophila Pr/set7 was
lethal: second instar larval death coincided with the loss of H4-lys20
methylation, indicating a fundamental role for Pr/set7 in development.
Transcriptionally competent regions lacked H4-lys20 methylation, but the
modification coincided with condensed chromosomal regions on polytene
chromosomes, including chromocenter and euchromatic arms. The Drosophila
male X chromosome, which is hyperacetylated at H4-lys16, had
significantly decreased levels of lys20 methylation compared with that
of females. In vitro, methylation of lys20 and acetylation of lys16 on
the H4 tail were competitive. Taken together, these results supported
the hypothesis that methylation of H4-lys20 maintains silent chromatin,
in part, by precluding neighboring acetylation on the H4 tail.

Shi et al. (2007) showed that SET8 monomethylated p53 (TP53; 191170) in
human cell lines. This monomethylation suppressed p53-mediated
transcriptional activation of highly responsive target genes, such as
p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) and PUMA (BBC3; 605854), but it had little
influence on weak p53 targets. Depletion of SET8 augmented the
proapoptotic and checkpoint activation functions of p53, and SET8
expression was downregulated upon DNA damage.

Song et al. (2009) found evidence that expression of SET8 is regulated
by the microRNA MIR502 (300893; see MOLECULAR GENETICS).

Kudithipudi et al. (2012) synthesized peptides based on the SET8
recognition site surrounding monomethylated H4K20. They found that the
isolated SET domain of SET8 had a relatively long recognition sequence
covering 7 amino acids. SET8 methylated a number of the synthesized
peptides, suggesting that it could potentially methylate several
nonhistone proteins in addition to p53.

By immunoprecipitation analysis of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, Yang
et al. (2012) found that SET8 interacts with TWIST (TWIST1; 601622), a
basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional factor that regulates
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Domain analysis revealed that
the N-terminal half of SET8 was required for the interaction. TWIST and
SET8 cooperated to promote EMT and metastasis in breast cancer cells
following implantation in mice. In knockdown and overexpression studies,
TWIST recruited SET8 to the promoter regions of E-cadherin (CDH1;
192090) and N-cadherin (CDH2; 114020), and histone H4K20 monomethylation
by SET8 resulted in downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of
N-cadherin.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Song et al. (2009) identified a SNP (dbSNP rs16917496C-T) in the SET8
miR502 (300893)-binding site that influenced SET8 expression. Breast
cancer tissues with the CC genotype, which represents the perfect
complementary seed sequence for miR502, had lower expression of SET8
mRNA than those with the TT genotype.

606592	TITLE *606592 VANIN 3; VNN3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database analysis, Granjeaud et al. (1999) identified a novel
human VNN gene, VNN3. Martin et al. (2001) cloned a full-length VNN3
cDNA encoding a deduced 501-amino acid protein with strong similarity to
the mouse vnn3 molecule. Both the mouse and human proteins lack the
GPI-anchor motif found in VNN1 (603570) and VNN2 (603571). Northern blot
analysis detected a 1.8-kb VNN3 mRNA in human liver, placenta, and
peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs). A 3.8-kb mRNA was observed in PBLs.

GENE FUNCTION

Martin et al. (2001) found that all vanin proteins are ectoenzymes with
pantetheinase activity. They showed that mouse vanin-3 and, by analogy,
human VNN3 are secreted molecules.

GENE STRUCTURE

Martin et al. (2001) determined that the human VNN1, VNN2, and VNN3
genes, as well as the mouse vnn1 and vnn3 genes, all contain 7 exons.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Martin et al. (2001) mapped the VNN3 gene to human
chromosome 6q23-q24 and mouse chromosome 10 in a cluster with VNN1 and
VNN2. All 3 genes are aligned in the same transcriptional orientation.

610711	TITLE *610711 TESTIS-SPECIFIC SERINE/THREONINE KINASE 4; TSSK4
;;TSSK5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TSSK4 belongs to a family of serine/threonine kinases highly expressed
in testis (Chen et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching databases for TSSK-like sequences, followed by PCR of a
testis cDNA library, Chen et al. (2005) cloned TSSK4, which they called
TSSK5. The deduced 328-amino acid protein is a putative serine/threonine
kinase. Northern blot analysis failed to detect TSSK4 expression, but
RT-PCR revealed TSSK4 expression in testis only.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and in vitro pull-down experiments, Chen et
al. (2005) showed the TSSK4 interacted with CREB (123810). TSSK4
phosphorylated CREB at ser133 and activated a CRE/CREB reporter gene in
transfected HEK293T cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (2005) determined that the TSSK4 gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chen et al. (2005) mapped the TSSK4 gene
to chromosome 14q11.2.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ST3GAL3 gene encodes
beta-galactoside-alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase-III, a Golgi resident
membrane protein that forms the sialyl Lewis a (sLe-a) epitope on
glyocoproteins. These glycoproteins form the glycocalyx, composed of
sialic acids that act as key determinants of a variety of cellular
recognition and communication processes (summary by Hu et al., 2011).

CLONING

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with a probe based on the
sialyl motif (a highly conserved region in the catalytic domain of
sialyltransferases), Kitagawa and Paulson (1993) isolated a cDNA
encoding SIAT6, which they termed ST3N (EC 2.4.99.6). The deduced
375-amino acid protein is 97% identical to the rat protein. SDS-PAGE
analysis showed expression of an 80-kD protein having sialyltransferase
activity. Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript with abundant expression in skeletal muscle and high
expression in fetal tissue but low expression in placenta.

Using Northern blot analysis, Kitagawa and Paulson (1994) evaluated the
differential expression of 5 human sialyltransferase genes in adult and
fetal tissues. A 2.7-kb ST3N transcript was expressed highly in skeletal
muscle and moderately in most other tissues examined. A 3.8-kb
transcript was also expressed in testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Taniguchi et al. (2003) determined that the 5-prime UTR of the ST3GAL3
gene consists of 2 exons. The 5-prime flanking region of the promoter
lacks canonical TATA or CCAAT boxes, but it contains several putative
transcriptional factor binding sites.

Hu et al. (2011) stated that the ST3GAL3 gene contains 15 exons, 12 of
which are coding exons.

MAPPING

The International RH Mapping Consortium mapped the SIAT6 gene to
chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG22084).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Recessive Mental Retardation 12

In affected members of 2 unrelated consanguineous Iranian families with
autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090),
Hu et al. (2011) used linkage analysis, chromosome sorting, and
next-generation sequencing to identify 2 different homozygous mutations
in the ST3GAL3 gene (A13D, 606494.0001 and D370Y, 606494.0002,
respectively.) Neither mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl
motifs, but rather affected the N-terminal transmembrane domain and
catalytic domain, respectively. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutant proteins were mislocalized to the endoplasmic
reticulum and that one (D370Y) had loss of catalytic activity. The
findings demonstrated a link between the glycoprotein complex,
sialyltransferase activity, and higher cognitive functioning.

- Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 15

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous mutation in the ST3GAL3 gene (A320P;
606494.0003). The mutation was identified by linkage analysis combined
with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. The mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl motif S,
which is crucially involved in binding of both donor and acceptor
substrate. In vitro functional expression studies showed that secretion
of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of control levels and it had no
detectable enzymatic activity. The phenotype was severe: patients showed
delayed psychomotor development and had onset of refractory infantile
spasms between ages 3 and 7 months associated with hypsarrhythmia on
EEG. Other features included hypotonia, poor eye contact, and inability
to speak or walk, even later in childhood. All were profoundly mentally
retarded. Edvardson et al. (2013) noted that the phenotype was more
severe than that observed by Hu et al. (2011), who had identified
ST3GAL3 mutations outside of the highly conserved and functionally
important sialyl motifs.

ST3GAL3, ALA13ASP

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), previously reported by
Najmabadi et al. (2007), Hu et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 38C-A
transversion in exon 2 of the ST3GAL3 gene, resulting in an ala13-to-asp
(A13D) substitution in the transmembrane domain. The mutation was not
found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls or
in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that most of the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. Catalytic activity of the A13D mutant enzyme was similar to
wildtype.

ST3GAL3, ASP370TYR

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), Hu et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1108G-T transversion in exon 14 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an asp370-to-tyr (D370Y) substitution in the
catalytic domain at the C-terminal end of the protein. The mutation was
not found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls
or in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. The D370Y mutant protein also showed a complete lack of enzyme
activity. Studies of recombinant proteins in CHO cells indicated that
secretion of the D370Y mutant protein was dramatically reduced compared
to wildtype. Hu et al. (2011) concluded that the mutant protein was
cleared by the endoplasmic reticulum-mediated system, suggesting that
the C terminus is important for the proper folding of functional
ST3GAL3.

ST3GAL3, ALA320PRO

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous 958G-C transversion in exon 12 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an ala320-to-pro (A320P) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in the sialyl motif S. The mutation was identified by
linkage analysis combined with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual
and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. It segregated with the disorder in
the family and was not found in 123 controls of the same ethnic origin
or in 5,379 control exomes. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that secretion of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of
control levels and that the protein had no detectable enzymatic
activity.

612317	TITLE *612317 ATPase FAMILY, AAA DOMAIN-CONTAINING, MEMBER 3B; ATAD3B
;;TOB3;;
AAA-TOB3;;
KIAA1273
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATAD3A (612316) and ATAD3B are mitochondrial membrane proteins that
contribute to the stabilization of large mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA)-protein complexes called nucleoids (He et al., 2007).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned ATAD3B, which they designated
KIAA1273. The deduced protein contains 606 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected low ATAD3B expression in testis and ovary, with weaker
expression in liver. Little to no expression was detected in other adult
and fetal tissues examined. Within specific adult brain regions, weak
expression was detected in caudate nucleus, and little to no expression
was detected in other brain regions.

By database analysis and 5-prime RACE, Schaffrik et al. (2006) obtained
cDNAs encoding long and short isoforms of ATAD3B, which they called
AAA-TOB3. The variants arise from alternative transcription initiation
sites, and the short variant includes the 3-prime sequence of intron 2,
which contains an alternate, in-frame ATG start site. The deduced 606-
and 648-amino acid ATAD3B proteins have unique N-terminal ends
containing 52 and 94 amino acids, respectively, followed by a common
transmembrane region and a C-terminal AAA-ATPase domain. RT-PCR detected
both transcripts in head and neck carcinoma and cervix carcinoma cell
lines. Both fluorescence-tagged ATAD3B isoforms localized to
mitochondria in transfected HeLa cells and in GHD-1 cells established
from a hypopharynx carcinoma.

By searching for sequences similar to rat Atad3, He et al. (2007)
identified human ATAD3A and ATAD3B. The deduced 648-amino acid ATAD3B
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 72 kD. In its C-terminal
half, ATAD3B contains Walker A and B motifs, followed by ATP-binding
sensor-1 and sensor-2 motifs. An alpha helix is located N-terminal to
the Walker A motif, and an arginine finger separates the sensor motifs.
An antibody that did not differentiate between ATAD3A and ATAD3B
detected ATAD3 in a punctate pattern within mitochondria of human
osteosarcoma cells. The pattern frequently coincided with
mtDNA-containing nucleoids, but not all nucleoids contained ATAD3.

Bogenhagen et al. (2008) stated that ATAD3B contains a central
transmembrane domain. Using immunofluorescence and protease
susceptibility studies, they found that ATAD3B was embedded in the inner
membrane of HeLa cell mitochondria, with the C-terminal AAA domain
directed toward the matrix and the N terminus exposed to the cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Da Cruz et al. (2003) found that prolonged expression of epitope-tagged
mouse Atad3b, which they called Tob3, in HeLa cells resulted in
fragmentation of the mitochondrial network and cell death.

Using laser capture microdissection, Schaffrik et al. (2006) found that
ATAD3B was overexpressed in 3 of 4 head and neck carcinomas compared
with healthy oral mucosa. In situ hybridization confirmed ATAD3B
overexpression in 5 head and neck carcinomas compared with normal
tissue. Expression of both ATAD3B isoforms was induced by MYC (190080).
In contrast to the findings of Da Cruz et al. (2003), Schaffrik et al.
(2006) found that knockdown of both human ATAD3B variants via small
interfering RNA (siRNA), but not their overexpression, caused cell
line-specific apoptotic phenotypes. In GHD-1 cells, siRNA treatment
resulted in apoptosis associated with decreased proliferation, cell
enlargement and vacuolization, and generation of polynucleated cells due
to failure of cytokinesis. In HeLa cells, siRNA treatment induced
apoptosis rapidly, with no formation of polynucleated cells.

He et al. (2007) found that depletion of ATAD3 via siRNA in human
osteosarcoma cells led to increased negative supercoiling of mtDNA,
although mitochondria maintained essentially normal morphology. A
recombinant N-terminal fragment of ATAD3B containing residues 44 through
247 displayed sequence-independent binding of tightly supercoiled mtDNA
that included a short, triple-stranded noncoding region called a
displacement loop, or D loop. This ATAD3B fragment also bound duplex DNA
and single-stranded DNA, but with lower affinity. The N-terminal ATAD3B
fragment and RecA (RAD51; 179617) bound to a synthetic D loop, and the
pronounced mobility shift effected by the ATAD3B fragment suggested that
it accrues multiple mtDNA molecules or that each D loop is bound by a
large number of ATAD3B molecules.

Bogenhagen et al. (2008) found that, although both ATAD3A and ATAD3B
were present in native HeLa cell nucleoids, neither ATAD3 protein was
crosslinked with mtDNA in isolated formaldehyde crosslinked HeLa cell
nucleoids, indicating that they are unlikely to bind mtDNA. In addition,
protease susceptibility studies suggested that the putative N-terminal
DNA-binding regions of ATAD3A and ATAD3B reside outside the
mitochondrial inner membrane.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schaffrik et al. (2006) determined that the ATAD3B gene contains 16
exons. Intron 1 contains a canonical MYC-binding E-box sequence, and
intron 2 contains an alternate translation initiation site.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the ATAD3B
gene to chromosome 1. By genomic sequence analysis, Schaffrik et al.
(2006) mapped the ATAD3B gene to chromosome 1p36.33

608337	TITLE *608337 OTU DOMAIN-CONTAINING UBIQUITIN ALDEHYDE-BINDING PROTEIN 1; OTUB1
;;OTU DOMAIN-CONTAINING UBAL-BINDING PROTEIN 1;;
OTUBAIN 1; OTU1; OTB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Otubains, such as OTB1, are deubiquitylating cysteine proteases (DUBs;
see 602519) that belong to the ovarian tumor (OTU) protein superfamily.
Like other DUBs, otubains cleave proteins precisely at the ubiquitin
(UB; see 191339)-protein bond (Balakirev et al., 2003).

CLONING

By affinity purification of DUBs from HeLa cells using UB aldehyde
(UBAL), followed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrophotometric analysis,
Balakirev et al. (2003) obtained cDNAs encoding OTB1 and OTB2 (608338).
The 271-amino acid, 31-kD OTB1 protein contains UB-interaction motifs
(UIMs) and UB-associated (UBA) domains, as well as putative nuclear
localization signals and a consensus LxxLL motif. RT-PCR and Western
blot analyses revealed wide expression of OTB1, with 2 isoforms in
leukocytes.

By PCR and immunoblot analysis, Soares et al. (2004) identified an
815-bp OTB1 isoform, which was expressed ubiquitously, and a 950-bp
isoform, which was expressed only in lymphoid tissue. The 815-bp isoform
encodes the 31-kD protein reported by Balakirev et al. (2003), whereas
the 950-bp isoform encodes a 35-kD, 315-amino acid protein, OTB1ARF1
(OTB1 alternative reading frame-1), that lacks the asp and cys residues
in the OTU cysteine proteinase catalytic core and retains only the
C-terminal flanking region of the OTU domain. The OTB1ARF1 transcript is
produced from the same transcription start site as OTB1 but uses an AUG
codon located in exon 2 and in a different reading frame from that of
OTB1. In addition, there is no splicing between exons 4 and 5 in
OTB1ARF1, which causes a frameshift back to the same reading frame as
OTB1.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Soares et al. (2004) showed that GRAIL
(RNF128; 300439) binds to OTB1. Although OTB1 was found to have DUB
activity, it failed to deubiquitinate polyubiquitinated GRAIL.
Immunoprecipitation and coexpression analysis indicated that OTB1, but
not OTB1ARF1, binds to the C-terminal UCH catalytic domain of USP8
(603158) in a trimolecular complex with GRAIL. Soares et al. (2004)
studied cells from T-cell receptor-transgenic mice expressing the
alternative forms of OTB1. OTB1-expressing cells contained negligible
amounts of Grail, proliferated well, and produced large amounts of
interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) after antigenic stimulation. In contrast,
cells expressing OTB1ARF1 contained large amounts of Grail and were
functionally anergic, proliferating poorly and not producing Il2. Soares
et al. (2004) concluded that the balance of OTB1 and OTB1ARF1 in T cells
is an important factor that regulates GRAIL stability and the outcome of
immune responses in secondary lymphoid organs.

Nakada et al. (2010) reported that OTUB1, a deubiquitinating enzyme, is
an inhibitor of double stranded break induced chromatin ubiquitination.
Surprisingly, they found that OTUB1 suppresses RNF168 (612688)-dependent
polyubiquitination independently of its catalytic activity. OTUB1 does
so by binding to and inhibiting UBC13 (UBE2N; 603679), the cognate E2
enzyme for RNF168. Nakada et al. (2010) suggested that this unusual mode
of regulation is unlikely to be limited to UBC13 because analysis of
OTUB1-associated proteins revealed that OTUB1 binds to E2s of the UBE2D
and UBE2E subfamilies. Finally, OTUB1 depletion mitigates the
double-stranded break repair defect associated with defective ATM
(607585) signaling, indicating that pharmacologic targeting of the
OTUB1-UBC13 interaction might enhance the DNA damage response.

Using immunoblot analysis, Lin et al. (2009) demonstrated expression of
GRAIL in naive mouse and human CD4 (186940) T lymphocytes. They found
that, upon CD4 T-cell activation, OTUB1 was expressed and GRAIL was
degraded, allowing proliferation to proceed. Preventing OTUB1 expression
with CTLA4 (123890)-Ig, anti-IL2, or rapamycin, all of which target MTOR
(FRAP1; 601231), resulted in maintenance of GRAIL and inhibition of CD4
T-cell proliferation. Lin et al. (2009) concluded that a pathway
sequentially links CD28 (186760) costimulation, IL2 expression, IL2R
(IL2RA; 147730) signaling, and MTOR activation as important requirements
for naive CD4 T-cell proliferation through the regulation of OTUB1 and
GRAIL expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Soares et al. (2004) determined that the OTB1 gene contains 7 exons.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Wiener et al. (2012) described structural and biochemical studies
elucidating how OTUB1 inhibits UBC13 and other E2 enzymes. They
unexpectedly found that OTUB1 binding to UBC13-Ub (the ubiquitin
thiolester) is allosterically regulated by free ubiquitin, which binds
to a second site in OTUB1 and increases its affinity for UBC13-Ub, while
at the same time disrupting interactions with UEV1A (602995) in a manner
that depends on the OTUB1 N terminus. Crystal structures of an
OTUB1-UBC13 complex and of OTUB1 bound to ubiquitin aldehyde and a
chemical UBC13-Ub conjugate showed that binding of free ubiquitin to
OTUB1 triggers conformational changes in the OTU domain and formation of
a ubiquitin-binding helix in the N terminus, thus promoting binding of
the conjugated donor ubiquitin in UBC13-Ub to OTUB1. The donor ubiquitin
thus cannot interact with the E2 enzyme, which has been shown to be
important for ubiquitin transfer. The N-terminal helix of OTUB1 is
positioned to interfere with UEV1A binding to UBC13, as well as with
attack on the thiolester by an acceptor ubiquitin, thereby inhibiting
K63Ub synthesis. OTUB1 binding also occludes the RING E3 binding site on
UBC13, thus providing a further component of inhibition. Wiener et al.
(2012) concluded that the general features of the inhibition mechanism
explained how OTUB1 inhibits other E2 enzymes in a noncatalytic manner.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Balakirev et al. (2003) mapped the OTUB1
gene to chromosome 11q13.1.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Synaptotagmins, such as SYT6, share a common domain structure that
includes a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic region composed of 2
C2 domains. Some synaptotagmins are involved in synaptic membrane
fusion, while others have a more general function in endocytosis. For
further information on synaptotagmins, see 185605.

CLONING

Li et al. (1995) cloned rat Syt6. RT-PCR detected expression of Syt6 in
all tissues examined. By in vitro assay of recombinant protein, Li et
al. (1995) showed that Syt6 bound adaptor protein-2 (see 601026) in a
Ca(2+)-independent manner. However, unlike several other synaptotagmins,
Syt6 did not bind phospholipids, and binding to syntaxin (see 186590)
was Ca(2+)-independent.

MAPPING

The International Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SYT6 gene to
chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG22846).

;;T2R46;;
T2R54
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TAS2R46 belongs to the large TAS2R receptor family. TAS2Rs are expressed
on the surface of taste receptor cells and mediate the perception of
bitterness through a G protein-coupled second messenger pathway (Conte
et al., 2002). For further information on TAS2Rs, see 604791.

CLONING

By screening the human genome for sequences related to TAS2Rs, Conte et
al. (2002) cloned TAS2R46, which they called T2R54. The deduced
309-amino acid protein contains the 7-transmembrane structure and short
N- and C-terminal domains conserved in TAS2Rs. The intracellular domains
share significant conservation with other TAS2R family members. TAS2R46
shares highest sequence similarity with TAS2R43 (612668) and TAS2R44
(TAS2R31; 612669).

GENE FUNCTION

Shah et al. (2009) found that motile cilia emerging from human airway
epithelial cells express sensory bitter taste receptors, including T2R4
(604869), T2R43, T2R38 (607751), and T2R46. Only ciliated epithelial
cells expressed these receptors, and they specifically localized in
cilia. The receptors appeared to localize preferentially at different
places along the cilium. T2R46 appeared to reside proximally in cilia.
Bitter compounds increased the intracellular calcium ion concentration
and stimulated ciliary beat frequency. Shah et al. (2009) found that
alpha-gustducin (139395) and the enzyme phospholipase C-beta-2 (PLCB2;
604114) are also expressed in airway epithelia. Alpha-gustducin resides
in the cilia, and PLCB2 appears to sit below the cilia in the apical
portion of the cell. Shah et al. (2009) concluded that airway epithelia
contain a cell-autonomous system in which motile cilia both sense
noxious substances entering airways and initiate a defensive mechanism
to eliminate the offending compound. Hence, like primary cilia,
classical motile cilia also contain sensors to detect the external
environment.

Brockhoff et al. (2010) found that exchanging 2 residues within
C-terminal transmembrane domain-7 of the related human taste receptors
TAS2R46, which is activated by strychnine, and TAS2R31, which is
activated by aristolochic acid, was sufficient to invert their agonist
selectivity. Transfer of functionally relevant amino acids in TAS2R46 to
the corresponding positions of TAS2R43 and TAS2R31 resulted in
pharmacologic properties indistinguishable from parental TAS2R46.

MAPPING

By screening of a human-rodent somatic cell hybrid panel, Conte et al.
(2002) assigned the TAS2R46 gene to chromosome 12, within the cluster on
12p13.2 that also contains TAS2R43 and TAS2R44.

603085	TITLE *603085 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 31 (COPPER TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 1; SLC31A1
;;COPPER TRANSPORTER 1; COPT1; CTR1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Copper is an element essential for life, but excessive copper can be
toxic or even lethal to the cell. Therefore, cells have developed
sophisticated ways to maintain a critical copper balance, with the
intake, export, and intracellular compartmentalization or buffering of
copper strictly regulated. The 2 related genes ATP7A (300011) and ATP7B
(606882), responsible for the human diseases Menkes syndrome (309400)
and Wilson disease (277900), respectively, are involved in copper
export. In S. cerevisiae, the copper uptake genes CTR1, CTR2, and CTR3
have been identified, and in human the CTR1 and CTR2 (603088) genes have
been identified.

CLONING

Zhou and Gitschier (1997) isolated a human cDNA encoding COPT1, which
they called CTR1, by functional complementation of the yeast
high-affinity copper uptake mutant ctr1. The deduced 190-amino acid
human CTR1 protein is similar to yeast CTR1 and Arabidopsis COPT1, a
copper transporter also isolated by functional complementation of yeast
ctr1. All 3 predicted proteins have 3 transmembrane domains and an N
terminus that is rich in methionine and serine residues; the N terminus
of human CTR1 is also abundant in histidines. Northern blot analysis
detected 2 major CTR1 transcripts of approximately 2 kb and 5.5 kb and a
less abundant transcript of about 8.5 kb in all human organs and tissues
examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhou and Gitschier (1997) proposed that CTR1 is a high-affinity copper
uptake gene because it could complement the yeast ctr1 mutation, it
could rescue multiple defects in ctr1 yeast, its expression in ctr1
yeast increased the concentration of cellular copper, and its
overexpression in yeast led to a vulnerability to the toxicity of copper
overload.

Moller et al. (2000) found that cells expressing CTR1 but not those
expressing CTR2 showed a dramatic hyperaccumulation of radioactive
copper, comparable to that seen in fibroblasts from Menkes disease
patients. However, in contrast to the Menkes syndrome fibroblasts, the
CTR1-expressing fibroblasts had an efflux rate similar to normal
fibroblasts.

By cross-linking CTR1 transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, Lee et al.
(2002) demonstrated that CTR1 forms a homotrimer as part of a copper
transport channel. Functional assays revealed that it stimulates the
initial rate of radiolabeled copper uptake. CTR1 transports copper with
high affinity in a time-dependent and saturable manner and is
copper-specific. Transport is an energy-independent process and is
stimulated by extracellular acidic pH and high K+ concentrations.

Using pulse-chase labeling followed by immunoprecipitation, Klomp et al.
(2002) found that endogenous CTR1 is synthesized in HeLa cells as a
28-kD precursor containing N-linked oligosaccharides, and it is
processed into a 35-kD mature protein. Immunofluorescent microscopy
showed that the subcellular localization of CTR1 differed between cell
types. In some cells, including HeLa, lung, and hepatocellular carcinoma
cell lines, it predominantly localized in a vesicular perinuclear
compartment, while in other cells, including choriocarcinoma and colon
carcinoma cell lines, it localized predominantly at the plasma membrane.
The localization of CTR1 was not influenced by copper concentration, but
inhibition of endocytosis caused a partial redistribution of CTR1 to the
cell surface of HeLa cells.

Using accessibility of epitopes to antibody before or after cell
permeabilization, Eisses and Kaplan (2002) determined that CTR1,
expressed at the surface of transfected sf9 insect cells, has an
extracellular N terminus and an intracellular C terminus. Using
mutagenic analysis, they determined that neither of the 2 cys residues,
cys161 and cys189, play a role in copper uptake, and that glycosylation
of CTR1 is not required for function.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURE {1:Aller and Unger (2006)} reported the 6-angstrom

projection structure of human CTR1. The projection of CTR1 revealed a
symmetrical trimer less than 40 angstroms wide. The center 3-fold axis
of each trimer formed a region of very low electron density likely to be
involved in copper translocation. The structure of the putative pore was
more closely related to channel proteins than to typical primary and
secondary active transporters.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Moller et al. (2000) determined that the
CTR1 gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

Zhou and Gitschier (1997) found that the 3-prime untranslated region of
the human CTR1 gene contains a CA repeat marker (D9S262) that had
previously been mapped to 9q31-q32. By analysis of YAC clones, they
showed that CTR1 and CTR2, which is also located in 9q31-q32, are not
adjacent genes. Moller et al. (2000) identified an apparent CTR1
pseudogene (CTR1P) on 3q25-q27.

ANIMAL MODEL

To test the hypothesis that CTR1 is required for copper delivery to
mammalian cells, Kuo et al. (2001) inactivated the Ctr1 gene in mice by
targeted mutagenesis. They observed early embryonic lethality in
homozygous mutant embryos and a deficiency in copper uptake in the
brains of heterozygous animals. A study of the spatial and temporal
expression pattern of Ctr1 during mouse development and adulthood
further showed that Ctr1 is ubiquitously transcribed with highest
expression observed in the specialized epithelia of the choroid plexus
and renal tubules and in connective tissues of the eye, ovary, and
testis. Similarly, Lee et al. (2001) showed that the mouse Ctr1 gene
encodes a component of the copper transport machinery and that mice
heterozygous for Ctr1 exhibit tissue-specific defects in copper
accumulation and in the activities of copper-dependent enzymes. Mice
completely deficient for Ctr1 exhibited profound growth and
developmental defects and died in utero in midgestation.

610528	TITLE *610528 CHROMODOMAIN HELICASE DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 8; CHD8
;;AXIS DUPLICATION INHIBITOR; DUPLIN;;
KIAA1564
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA library,
Nagase et al. (2000) cloned CHD8, which they designated KIAA1564. The
deduced protein contains 1,417 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected
moderate expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific brain
regions examined.

Sakamoto et al. (2000) cloned rat Chd8, which they called Duplin. The
deduced 749-amino acid protein was expressed mainly in the nuclear
fraction of transfected COS cells.

Ishihara et al. (2006) cloned mouse Chd8. The deduced 2,582-amino acid
protein has 2 chromodomains, followed by a central helicase/ATPase
domain and 2 C-terminal BRK domains. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous Chd8 expression in mouse tissues, with highest levels in
heart and testis. Western blot analysis of HeLa cells detected
endogenous CHD8 at an apparent molecular mass of 240 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Sakamoto et al. (2000) found that rat Duplin bound directly to the
armadillo repeats of beta-catenin (see CTNNB1; 116806) in the nuclei of
mammalian cells, thereby inhibiting binding of TCF4 (TCF7L2; 602228) to
beta-catenin and beta-catenin-dependent activation of TCF4. Expression
of Duplin in Xenopus embryos inhibited axis formation and beta
catenin-dependent axis duplication, and it countered the ability of
beta-catenin to rescue ventralizing phenotypes induced by ultraviolet
irradiation. Sakamoto et al. (2000) concluded that Duplin is a nuclear
protein that negatively regulates Wnt (see 164820) signaling by binding
beta-catenin.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse brain cDNA library, followed by
studies in COS cells, Kobayashi et al. (2002) found that importin-alpha
(see KPNA2; 600685) bound a cluster of basic amino acids in rat Duplin.
Interaction with importin-alpha caused Duplin to translocate to the
nucleus, and nuclear localization of Duplin was essential for inhibition
of Wnt-dependent activation of TCF4 in mammalian cells and
ventralization in Xenopus embryos. Additional experiments in Xenopus
embryos showed that Duplin also inhibited the Wnt signaling pathway
downstream of beta-catenin target genes.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis and pull-down assays, Ishihara et al.
(2006) found that the C-terminal region of mouse Chd8 interacted with
the zinc finger domain of Ctcf (604167). Chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis of a human hepatoma cell line revealed that CHD8 was present at
CTCF target sites, such as the differentially methylated region of H19
(103280), the locus control region of beta-globin (141900), and the
promoter regions of the BRCA1 (113705) and MYC (190080) genes.
Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated an endogenous complex of CHD8
and CTCF in HeLa cells. Knockdown of CHD8 in HeLa cells by RNA
interference abolished the CTCF-dependent insulator activity of the H19
differentially methylated region, leading to reactivation of imprinted
IGF2 (147470) from the maternal chromosome. Lack of CHD8 affected CpG
methylation and histone acetylation around the CTCF-binding sites, which
are adjacent to heterochromatin, of the BRCA1 and MYC genes. Ishihara et
al. (2006) concluded that CTCF-CHD8 has a role in insulation and
epigenetic regulation at active insulator sites.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid library screen, Batsukh et al. (2010) identified
CHD8 as an interacting partner of CHD7 (608892), mutations in which
cause the autosomal dominant malformation syndrome CHARGE (214800). In a
direct yeast 2-hybrid system, the CHD7-CHD8 interaction was disrupted by
CHD7 missense mutations found in CHARGE patients, including gly2108 to
arg (608892.0011), whereas in coimmunoprecipitation studies disruption
of the CHD7-CHD8 interaction by the mutations could not be observed. The
authors hypothesized that CHD7 and CHD8 proteins interact directly and
indirectly via additional linker proteins. Disruption of the direct
CHD7-CHD8 interaction may change the conformation of a putative large
CHD7-CHD8 complex and could be a disease mechanism in CHARGE syndrome.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nishiyama et al. (2004) determined that the mouse Chd8 gene contains 9
exons and spans about 13 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CHD8
gene to chromosome 14 (TMAP G36016).

Nishiyama et al. (2004) mapped the mouse Duplin gene to chromosome 14.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

O'Roak et al. (2012) performed whole-exome sequencing for parent-child
trios exhibiting sporadic autism spectrum disorders, including 189 new
trios and 20 that were previously reported (O'Roak et al., 2011). In
addition, O'Roak et al. (2012) sequenced the exomes of 50 unaffected
sibs corresponding to 31 of the new and 19 of the previously reported
trios, for a total of 677 individual exomes from 209 families. In
proband exomes, O'Roak et al. (2012) found 2 de novo disruptive
mutations in CHD8, a nonsense mutation and a frameshift indel.

Sanders et al. (2012) combined all de novo events in their sample with
those identified in the study of O'Roak et al. (2012) and observed from
a total of 414 probands that the CHD8 gene carried 2 highly disruptive
mutations.

In a study of exonic de novo mutations in autism spectrum disorders (see
209850), Neale et al. (2012) identified 3 loss-of-function mutations in
the CHD8 gene among 935 cases and no mutations in CHD8 among 870
controls.

O'Roak et al. (2012) identified 9 de novo mutations in the CHD8 gene
among 2,446 autism spectrum probands. Seven were nonsense or frameshift
mutations, 1 was a splice site mutation, and 1 was an in-frame deletion.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nishiyama et al. (2004) found that development of Duplin -/- mouse
embryos was arrested at gastrulation, with the embryos manifesting
massive apoptosis. In contrast, Duplin +/- mice appeared normal and were
fertile. Expression of beta-catenin target genes was not increased in
Duplin -/- embryos, suggesting that the lack of Duplin did not result in
constitutive activation of Wnt signaling during embryogenesis.

606210	TITLE *606210 SELENOPROTEIN N, 1; SEPN1
;;SELN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Selenium deficiency can interfere with normal embryonic development and
fertility or promote the occurrence of certain cancers and viral
diseases. Selenocysteine, the major form of selenium in animals, is
directly involved in the catalytic reaction of selenoproteins.
Selenocysteine is encoded by an in-frame UGA codon. Avoidance of a
translational stop requires the presence of a selenocysteine insertion
sequence (SECIS), a hairpin conserved in the 3-prime untranslated region
(UTR) of all selenoprotein mRNAs. By searching an EST database for
sequences that can adopt a SECIS-like secondary structure, followed by
glutathione peroxidase functional analysis, further database searching,
and 5-prime RACE, Lescure et al. (1999) identified a partial cDNA
encoding SEPN1, which they termed SELN. Sequence analysis detected a
SECIS in the 3-prime UTR of SEPN1. Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous expression of a 4.5-kb SEPN1 transcript, with highest levels
in pancreas, ovary, prostate, and spleen. Hemagglutinin-tagged SEPN1 was
expressed as a 60-kD protein in the presence of a wildtype SECIS element
but not a mutant SECIS element. Lescure et al. (1999) concluded that the
3-prime UTR is a repository of functional RNA motifs instrumental in
posttranscriptional control.

By 5-prime RACE and RT-PCR analysis, Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001)
characterized the full-length SEPN1 cDNA. They found that SEPN1 produces
a 4.5-kb transcript with an open reading frame encoding a 590-amino acid
protein. EST database searches and RT-PCR experiments predicted that
there are 2 isoforms of SEPN1. Isoform 1 corresponds to the full-length
transcript, whereas exon 3 is spliced out in isoform 2. Both transcripts
were detected in skeletal muscle, brain, lung, and placenta, but isoform
2 was always predominant. The exon 3 sequence corresponds to an Alu
cassette and contains a second in-frame selenocysteine codon.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) determined
that the SEPN1 gene contains 13 exons and spans 18.5 kb.

MAPPING

By PAC analysis, Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) mapped the SEPN1 gene to
1p36-p35, where the locus for rigid spine muscular dystrophy-1 (RSMD1;
602771) maps.

GENE FUNCTION

Using polyclonal antibodies directed against SEPN1 and cDNA constructs
encoding the 2 isoforms, Petit et al. (2003) showed that the main SEPN1
gene product corresponds to a 70-kD protein containing a single
selenocysteine residue. Subcellular fractionation experiments and
endoglycosidase H sensitivity indicated that SEPN1 is a glycoprotein
localized within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Immunofluorescence
analyses confirmed this subcellular localization, and GFP fusion
experiments demonstrated the presence of an ER-addressing and -retention
signal within the N terminus. SEPN1 was present at a high level in
several human fetal tissues and at a lower level in adult tissues,
including skeletal muscle. Its high expression in cultured myoblasts was
also downregulated in differentiating myotubes, suggesting a role for
SEPN1 in early development and in cell proliferation or regeneration.

Jurynec et al. (2008) found that the zebrafish ortholog of Sepn1 was
required for development of the slow muscle fiber lineage.
Downregulation of Sepn1 resulted in disorganized muscle myofibrils and
prominent Z-band anomalies not seen in wildtype muscle. Ryr1a (see RYR1;
180901) and Ryr3 (180903) were also required for formation of
normal-appearing slow muscle cells. Sepn1 stably associated with Ryr
proteins and functioned as a modifier of Ryr calcium flux activity and
redox responsiveness.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The association between selenium deficiency and muscular dystrophy in
livestock suggests a role for selenium in the pathophysiology of
striated muscles. In humans, selenium deficiency is associated with a
cardiomyopathy known as Keshan disease, reported from selenium-deficient
areas of China (Ge et al., 1983). In 10 families with RSMD1,
Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) identified 2 frameshift, 1 nonsense, and 3
missense mutations in the SEPN1 gene. The nonsense mutation
(606210.0002) identified in a French family transformed the
selenocysteine codon into a stop codon, preventing selenocysteine
incorporation and leading to a shorter protein. The missense mutations
changed residues that are conserved in vertebrates. Two of these mutated
residues were clustered in 1 region, the third being in close proximity
to the selenocysteine residue.

Multiminicore disease is an autosomal recessive congenital myopathy
characterized by the presence of multiple, short core lesions (known as
minicores) in most muscle fibers. On the basis of clinical and
morphologic data, Ferreiro et al. (2002) suspected a relationship
between classic multiminicore disease and RSMD1 due to mutation in the
SEPN1 gene. A genomewide screen, followed by the analysis of 1p36
microsatellite markers in 27 informative families with multiminicore
disease, demonstrated linkage to the RSMD1 locus in 8 families. All
showed axial myopathy with scoliosis and respiratory failure, consistent
with the most severe end of the classic multiminicore disease spectrum;
spinal rigidity was evident in some, but not all, patients. Screening of
SEPN1 in the 8 families that showed linkage and in 14 patients with
classic sporadic disease revealed 9 mutations affecting 17 patients in
12 families; 6 were novel mutations and 3 had been described in patients
with RSMD1. Analysis of 3 deltoid biopsy specimens from patients with
typical RSMD revealed a wide myopathologic variability, ranging from a
dystrophic to a congenital myopathy pattern. A variable proportion of
minicores was found in all samples. The authors concluded that RSMD1 and
the most severe form of classic multiminicore disease are the same
entity.

Clarke et al. (2006) identified a homozygous mutation in the SEPN1 gene
(606210.0008) in patients with congenital fiber-type disproportion
(CFTD; 255310), a congenital muscular dystrophy that has clinical
features similar to those observed in RSMD1.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, GLY273GLU

In affected members of 2 Iranian and 3 Turkish families with rigid spine
muscular dystrophy-1 (602771), Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) identified a
G-to-A transition at nucleotide 817 of the SEPN1 gene, causing a
gly273-to-glu substitution.

.0002
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, SEC462TER

In a French family with rigid spine muscular dystrophy (602771),
Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide
1385 of the SEPN1 gene. The mutation changed the selenocysteine (sec)
codon (TGA) into a stop codon (TAA), preventing selenocysteine
incorporation and leading to a shorter protein.

.0003
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, MET1VAL

In 3 unrelated families of Italian, Belgian, and German origin with
multiminicore disease (602771), Ferreiro et al. (2002) identified a
homozygous A-to-G transition in the start codon of the SEPN1 gene,
resulting in a met1-to-val (M1V) substitution. In the family from
Germany consanguinity was known. Two children in the family from Italy
were affected.

.0004
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, ARG466GLN

In patients with rigid spine muscular dystrophy (602771), Moghadaszadeh
et al. (2001) identified homozygosity for a G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 1397 of the SEPN1 gene, resulting in an arg466-to-gln (R466Q)
substitution.

In patients with multiminicore disease, Ferreiro et al. (2002)
identified the R466Q mutation in compound heterozygous state with a
trp453-to-ser (W453S) substitution resulting from a G-to-C transversion
at nucleotide 1358 (606210.0005). They also identified the R466Q
mutation in a compound heterozygous state with a 1-bp insertion (A) at
nucleotide 713 (606210.0006), resulting in a frameshift.

Jurynec et al. (2008) found that ryanodine receptors (RYRs; see 180901)
in muscle lysates prepared from muscle from a patient with congenital
myopathy and the R466Q mutation showed reduced ryanodine binding
compared with control tissue. Addition of wildtype zebrafish Sepn1
partially restored the binding capacity of diseased muscle lysates and
fully restored the ability of human RYRs from diseased muscle lysates to
respond to changes in the redox potential of the binding environment.

RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, SEC462GLY

In a Portuguese family in which 2 children had multiminicore disease
(602771), Ferreiro et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for a T-to-G
transversion at nucleotide 1384 in exon 10 of the SEPN1 gene, resulting
in a sec462-to-gly (U462G) substitution.

.0008
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
MYOPATHY, CONGENITAL, WITH FIBER-TYPE DISPROPORTION, INCLUDED
SEPN1, GLY315SER

In 2 unrelated families with multiminicore disease (602771) from Belgium
and the U.K. that shared identical RSMD1 haplotypes, suggesting a
founder effect, Ferreiro et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for a
943G-A transition in the SEPN1 gene, resulting in a gly315-to-ser
(G315S) substitution. A German patient with sporadic multiminicore
disease presented the same mutation in the compound heterozygous state
with R466Q (606210.0004).

Venance et al. (2005) identified the homozygous G315S mutation in a
patient with rigid spine muscular dystrophy who presented at age 26
years with cor pulmonale characterized by rapidly progressive
respiratory and right heart failure with cough, orthopnea, and daytime
sleepiness. Two sibs who were heterozygous carriers of the mutation had
mild neck restriction. Venance et al. (2005) emphasized the importance
of early nocturnal ventilatory assistance in these patients.

Clarke et al. (2006) reported 2 sisters, ages 32 and 30, respectively,
with a diagnosis of congenital fiber-type disproportion (CFTD; 255310)
who were homozygous for the G315S substitution. Skeletal muscle biopsies
showed that type 1 fibers were at least 12% smaller than type 2 fibers,
and there was no evidence of multiminicore disease or other findings
typical of RSMD1. Clinically, the women had a severe congenital myopathy
with truncal hypotonia in infancy, progressive scoliosis, progressive
respiratory impairment, and osteopenia. One woman was wheelchair-bound
and had had bilateral hip fractures in her twenties. Three additional
patients from another family with congenital muscular dystrophy were
homozygous for the G315S substitution; however, skeletal muscle biopsy
from 1 of these patients showed only nonspecific myopathy and did not
fulfill the pathologic criteria for CFTD. All 5 patients had abnormal
glucose tolerance tests and showed biochemical abnormalities suggesting
insulin resistance.

.0009
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, 92-BP DEL

In 4 affected patients with Mallory-body myopathy (602771) who came from
a genetic isolate in northern Germany (Goebel et al., 1980), Ferreiro et
al. (2004) identified a homozygous 92-bp deletion in the SEPN1 gene
starting 19 bp upstream of exon 1 and including the first 73 bp of exon
1 (del92, -19/+73). The deletion caused loss of the translation starting
codon. The parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

600233	TITLE *600233 GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC ACID RECEPTOR, GAMMA-3; GABRG3
;;GABA-A RECEPTOR, GAMMA-3 POLYPEPTIDE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors are a family of proteins
involved in the GABAergic neurotransmission of the mammalian central
nervous system. GABRG3 is a member of the GABA-A receptor gene family of
heteromeric pentameric ligand-gated ion channels through which GABA, the
major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, acts. GABA-A
receptors are the site of action of a number of important pharmacologic
agents including barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and ethanol (summary by
Whiting et al., 1999).

For additional general information about the GABA-A receptor gene
family, see GABRA1 (137160).

CLONING

Greger et al. (1995) cloned the gene for the gamma-3 subunit.

MAPPING

Russek and Farb (1994) stated that the GABRG3 is located on 15q11-q13 in
a cluster with GABRA5 (137142) and GABRB3 (137192). Thus, there is an
alpha/beta/gamma cluster of GABA receptor subunit subtype genes on 3
chromosomes, 15, 5, and 3. Russek and Farb (1994) suggested that these
may have originated from chromosome 15 because the centromere of that
chromosome is associated with increased amounts of satellite DNA and
translocations occur more frequently around such centromeres. Thus, it
can be speculated that the ancestral GABA-A receptor gene cluster formed
on chromosome 15 and thereafter spawned the clusters on chromosomes 4
and 5.

Greger et al. (1995) showed that the GABRG3 gene is 35 kb from the
alpha-5 subunit gene which, in turn, is about 100 kb from the beta-3
subunit locus. The latter is located at the centromeric end of the
cluster and is transcribed in the opposite direction of GABRG3 and
GABRA5. This orientation of the cluster is opposite that reported by
Russek and Farb (1994). Greger et al. (1995) confirmed that the GABRG3
gene maps to 15q11-q13 and they verified the order of the genes by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coding SNPs within the GABA receptor gene cluster on chromosome
15q11-q13, Hogart et al. (2007) demonstrated that the GABRG3, GABRB3,
and GABRA5 genes were biallelically expressed in the cerebral cortex of
21 postmortem human brain samples.

607797	TITLE *607797 SMALL NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN, 40-KD; SNRNP40
;;U5 snRNP-SPECIFIC PROTEIN, 40-KD;;
SPLICING FACTOR, 38-KD; SPF38;;
PRPF8-BINDING PROTEIN; PRPF8BP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNRNP40 is a component of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP)
particle. The U5 snRNP is part of the spliceosome, a multiprotein
complex involved in the removal of introns from nuclear pre-mRNAs
(Achsel et al., 1998).

CLONING

By 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis of spliceosomes from HeLa cell
nuclear extracts, followed by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry and
comparison with EST databases, Neubauer et al. (1998) cloned SPF38.
SPF38 has a calculated molecular mass of 38.4 kD and shows an apparent
molecular mass of 30 kD in 2-dimensional gels.

By microsequencing tryptic fragments and EST database searching, Achsel
et al. (1998) cloned SPF38. The deduced 357-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 39.3 kD. Except for 63 N-terminal amino
acids, the entire SPF38 protein is made up of 7 WD40 repeats. Highly
homologous protein sequences were found in rat, mouse, fruit fly, and
plant EST databases.

GENE FUNCTION

By sedimentation analysis, radioimmunoprecipitations, and Far Western
(overlay) analysis, Achsel et al. (1998) determined that SPF38 interacts
directly with PRPF8 (607300).

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the SNRNP40 gene to chromosome 1p35.2 based on an
alignment of the SNRNP40 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF090988) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

614953	TITLE *614953 SCHLAFEN FAMILY, MEMBER 11; SLFN11
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Schlafen (SFLN) family contains 9 mouse and 6 human genes that
encode proteins with a conserved N terminus containing a putative AAA
ATPase domain. Longer SLFN proteins, such as SLFN11, have C-terminal
motifs resembling DNA/RNA helicase domains. Studies in mouse have
implicated SLFN proteins in regulation of cell growth and T-cell
development (summary by Geserick et al. (2004) and Li et al. (2012)).

CLONING

Geserick et al. (2004) identified mouse Slfn5 (614952), Slfn8, Slfn9,
and Slfn10, which encode proteins that share significant homology with
mouse Slfn1 through Slfn4 in their N-terminal halves, but contain unique
C-terminal extensions with motifs homologous to DNA/RNA helicases.
Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10 share 85 to 87% amino acid identity with one
another, whereas Slfn5 is more distantly related to the former group,
sharing 40% identity.

Van Zuylen et al. (2011) noted that human SLFN11 and SLFN13 (614957) are
orthologous to mouse Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10.

Li et al. (2012) stated that the 901-amino acid human SLFN11 protein has
an AAA domain in its N-terminal half and a putative helicase sequence in
its C-terminal half. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that SLFN5 and SLFN11
were the most prominently expressed SLFN family members in several human
cell lines.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the SLFN11 gene to chromosome 17q12 based on an
alignment of the SLFN11 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC052586) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Bustos et al. (2009) found that the SLFN genes are clustered within the
same orthologous region flanked by the UNC45 (UNC45B; 611220) and PEX12
(601758) genes in all mammalian genomes examined. The human and mouse
SLFN clusters are located on chromosomes 17 and 11, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (2012) noted that levels of mouse SLFN proteins are elevated
after infection with Brucella or Listeria. Using quantitative RT-PCR,
they showed that lipopolysaccharide, poly-IC, or interferon (IFN)-alpha
(147660)/beta (147640) treatment of murine macrophages resulted in
induction of several SLFN genes. Treatment of human foreskin fibroblasts
with IFN-beta, poly-IC, or poly-dAdT revealed similar induction of SLFN
genes, including SLFN5 and SLFN11. Li et al. (2012) found that human
SLFN11, but not SLFN5, potently and specifically abrogated production of
retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see 609423),
and diminished the number of viral particles released from cells. The
inhibitory activity resided in the 579-residue N-terminal half of
SLFN11, which includes the AAA domain. Rather than affecting early steps
of the retroviral infection cycle, including reverse transcription,
integration, and transcription, SLFN11 selectively inhibited expression
of viral proteins in a codon-usage-dependent manner. SLFN11 bound tRNA
and counteracted changes in the tRNA pool elicited by HIV. Li et al.
(2012) concluded that SLFN11 is a potent, IFN-inducible restriction
factor against retroviruses that mediates its antiviral effects on the
basis of codon usage discrimination.

- Putative Mouse Orthologs of SLFN11

Using Northern blot analysis, Geserick et al. (2004) detected expression
of most mouse SLFN genes examined in Listeria monocytogenes-infected
mouse splenocytes, with little or no expression in uninfected mouse
cells. Ifngr (107470) was required for Slfn5, Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10
upregulation. Further analysis showed that mouse SLFNs were
differentially regulated in developing thymocytes, in activated
peripheral T cells, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or interferon-gamma
(IFNG; 147570)-activated macrophages, or during terminal myeloid
differentiation of M1 leukemia cells. Transgenic expression in mice
revealed that dysregulated expression of Slfn8 negatively influenced
thymocyte development and impaired the response of peripheral T cells to
T-cell receptor (see 186880)-mediated stimulation. Geserick et al.
(2004) concluded that SLFN genes are integrated into regulatory networks
that control T-cell development and activation.

EVOLUTION

Bustos et al. (2009) used genomic and phylogenetic studies to
investigate the evolution and role of the SLFN gene family. They found
that the SLFN family is widely distributed in mammals, with 4 major
clades that underwent lineage-specific expansions or contractions in
various orders, including primates and rodents. Bustos et al. (2009)
also identified SLFN family members in Chondrichthyes and Amphibia. They
found evidence that positive selection has acted on many SLFN genes. A
member of the SLFN family was horizontally transferred from mouse to
orthopoxviruses, where the authors hypothesized it plays a role in
allowing the virus to survive host defense mechanisms. The viral SLFN
sequences are evolving under purifying selection, indicating their
functional relevance.

Van Zuylen et al. (2011) noted that only 2 SLFN family members, SLFN5
and SLFN14 (614958), have direct orthologs in mouse and human,
consistent with rapid evolution of the SLFN family across mammalian
species. Human SLFN12 (614955) and SLFN12L (614956) have 4 orthologs in
mice (Slfn1, Slfn2, Slfn3, and Slfn4), and human SLFN11 and SLFN13 have
3 orthologs in mice (Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10).

600339	TITLE *600339 HEPATOMA-DERIVED GROWTH FACTOR; HDGF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nakamura et al. (1994) purified a novel hepatoma-derived growth factor
from the conditioned medium of human hepatoma-derived cell line HuH-7.
Molecular cloning of a cDNA from the cDNA library of the same cell line
was done on the basis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence. The cDNA
was 2.4 kb long and the deduced amino acid sequence contained 240 amino
acids without a signal peptide-like N-terminal hydrophobic sequence. The
primary sequence shared homology with the high mobility group-1 protein
(163905); they showed 23.4% amino acid identity and 35.6% amino acid
similarity.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunofluorescence study, Nakamura et al. (1994) showed that HDGF is
localized in the cytoplasm of hepatoma cells and northern blots showed
that it is expressed ubiquitously in normal tissues and tumor cell
lines. Nakamura et al. (1994) suggested that it is a novel
heparin-binding protein with mitogenic activity for fibroblasts.

MAPPING

By PCR screening of a commercial monochromosomal hybrid panel, Wanschura
et al. (1996) mapped HDGF to the X chromosome. By FISH, they refined the
localization to Xq25. Subsequently, however, the International Radiation
Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the HDGF gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP
SHGC-132090). Amberger (2007) refined the localization to 1q21 based on
an alignment of the HDGF sequence (GenBank GENBANK D16431) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

614638	TITLE *614638 DESUMOYLATING ISOPEPTIDASE 2; DESI2
;;PPPDE PEPTIDASE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; PPPDE1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The modification of proteins by small ubiquitin-like modifier, or SUMO
(see SUMO1; 601912), is crucial for the regulation of diverse cellular
processes. DESI2 is predicted to have a papain-like fold and to function
as a cysteine protease that removes SUMO from SUMO-modified proteins
(Shin et al., 2012).

CLONING

Shin et al. (2012) cloned mouse Desi2, which encodes a deduced 194-amino
acid protein with a central isopeptidase domain. By database analysis,
they identified the human and rat orthologs. Western blot analysis
detected Desi2 in all mouse tissues examined. Epitope-tagged Desi2
localized mainly to the cytoplasm of transfected 293T cells.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the DESI2 gene to chromosome 1q44 based on an
alignment of the DESI2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF151904) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

186760	TITLE *186760 ANTIGEN CD28; CD28
;;T-CELL ANTIGEN CD28;;
Tp44
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CD28 costimulation is essential for CD4 (186940)-positive T-cell
proliferation, survival, interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) production, and
T-helper type-2 (Th2) development.

CLONING

Monoclonal antibodies recognize 3 antigens, CD3 (186790), CD2 (186990),
and CD28 (Tp44), that cause human T cells to proliferate in the presence
of phorbol esters. Whereas CD3 appeared to be involved in transduction
of the signal generated by antigen binding to the T-cell receptor, the
role of the CD2 and CD28 antigens in physiologic proliferation was not
understood. Aruffo and Seed (1987) isolated a cDNA clone encoding CD28
by a simple and highly efficient cloning strategy based on transient
expression. In COS cells the CD28 encodes a highly glycosylated membrane
protein with homology to the immunoglobulin superfamily.

Magistrelli et al. (1999) identified 3 CD28 splice variants in
nonactivated T cells: CD28a, which lacks exon 3, leading to loss of the
transmembrane domain; CD28b, which lacks most of the 3-prime end of exon
2 and exon 3; and CD28c, which lacks exon 2 and exon 3. CD28b and CD28c
were expressed at a low level relative to CD28a. Magistrelli et al.
(1999) suggested that resting T cells may constitutively express both
membrane and soluble CD28, potentially regulating the T-cell response at
different levels.

GENE FUNCTION

Harada et al. (2003) noted that the CD28 cytoplasmic domain contains a
YMNM motif, which binds PI3K (see 601232) and GRB2 (108355), whereas the
corresponding region of ICOS (604558) contains a YMFM motif, which binds
the former but not the latter. Harada et al. (2003) hypothesized that
the reason CD28 signaling, but not ICOS signaling, induces IL2
production is its ability to bind GRB2. To test this hypothesis, they
generated mutant ICOS containing the YMNM motif of CD28. This alteration
allowed ICOS to activate the IL2 promoter, and further analysis showed
that GRB2 binding to ICOS led to activation of the NFAT (see 600490)/AP1
(165160) site in the IL2 promoter. Harada et al. (2003) concluded that
the difference of a single amino acid defines a functional difference
between CD28- and ICOS-mediated costimulatory signals.

By a comprehensive structure-function analysis of the mouse Cd28
cytoplasmic tail, Andres et al. (2004) found that Il2 production and
T-cell proliferation did not require a particular cytoplasmic domain.
However, Il4 (147780) production was driven by cooperative activity of
at least 2 structural motifs, a pro-rich motif at residues 187 to 190
and tyr residues at positions 170 and 188, within the Cd28 cytoplasmic
tail. A gene complementation approach determined that Pdk1 (605213), but
not Itk (186973) or Akt (164730), in an Akt-independent pathway,
mediated a component of the Il4 signal induced by Cd28.

CTLA4 shares 2 ligands, CD80 (112203) and CD86 (601020), with a
stimulatory receptor, CD28. Qureshi et al. (2011) showed that CTLA4 can
capture its ligands from opposing cells by a process of
trans-endocytosis. After removal, these costimulatory ligands are
degraded inside CTLA4-expressing cells, resulting in impaired
costimulation via CD28. Acquisition of CD86 from antigen-presenting
cells is stimulated by T cell receptor engagement and observed in vitro
and in vivo. Qureshi et al. (2011) concluded that their data revealed a
mechanism of immune regulation in which CTLA4 acts as an effector
molecule to inhibit CD28 costimulation by the cell-extrinsic depletion
of ligands, accounting for many of the features of the CD28-CTLA4
system.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lee et al. (1990) found that the CD28 gene is present in single copy and
is organized into 4 exons, each of which defines a functional domain of
the predicted protein. Posttranslational processing appears to result in
variant isotypes of CD28 with potentially different physiologic roles on
the cell surface.

MAPPING

Using in situ hybridization on prometaphase cells, Lafage-Pochitaloff et
al. (1990) demonstrated that the CD28 gene maps to 2q33-q34. The CTLA4
gene (123890) maps to the same region. Both are members of the Ig
superfamily, where they define a subgroup of membrane-bound single V
domains. The chromosomal proximity of CD28 and CTLA4 and their close
structural relationship suggest that these 2 genes resulted from
duplication of a common evolutionary precursor and that they share some
functional properties. By means of intersubspecific crosses, Howard et
al. (1991) mapped the Cd28 gene to the proximal part of mouse chromosome
1. By study of yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC), Buonavista et al.
(1992) demonstrated that the CD28 and CTLA4 genes were in the same
fragment, indicating that they were separated by only 25 to 150 kb. A
CpG island was found between these genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

CD28 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation after interacting with its
ligand, B7 (CD80; 112203). Phosphorylation of tyr173 (tyr170 in mouse)
in the cytoplasmic domain of CD28 allows the recruitment of signaling
proteins such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (see PIK3R1; 171833),
GRB2 (108355), and GADS (GRAP2; 604518) via their SH2 domains. Okkenhaug
et al. (2001) reconstituted CD28 knockout mice with transgenes encoding
wildtype Cd28 or Cd28 carrying a tyr170-to-phe mutation. Mutant Cd28 did
not bind to the SH2 domain of PIK3R1, resulting in diminished protein
kinase B (164730) activation. Mutant Cd28 was able to prevent the
induction of anergy, to promote T-cell proliferation and IL2 secretion,
and to provide B-cell help, but was unable to upregulate expression of
the prosurvival protein BCLXL (600039). The defect in BCLXL upregulation
was correlated with increased susceptibility of the T cells to gamma
radiation. Okkenhaug et al. (2001) suggested that other tyrosine
residues or asn172 may be critical to functions not affected by the
tyr170-to-phe mutation.

611501	TITLE *611501 CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 1; CAMTA1
;;KIAA0833
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned CAMTA1, which they designated
KIAA0833. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression in adult brain and
in all specific brain regions examined. Little to no expression was
detected in all other tissues examined, including fetal brain.

Nakajima et al. (2002) obtained a full-length CAMTA1 cDNA. The deduced
protein contains 1,734 amino acids.

By searching for genes similar to a plant Camta, Bouche et al. (2002)
identified human CAMTA1 and CAMTA2 (611508). Both deduced proteins
contain an N-terminal DNA-binding CG1 domain, followed by a central
transcription factor immunoglobulin (TIG) domain, 2 ankyrin repeats for
protein-protein interactions, and 4 C-terminal calmodulin
(114180)-binding IQ motifs. The CG1 domain includes a nuclear
localization signal.

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 1 frequently deleted in
neuroblastomas, Katoh and Katoh (2003) identified CAMTA1. The deduced
protein contains 1,673 amino acids and shares 94.1% identity with mouse
Camta1.

By immunohistochemical analysis of a neuroblastoma cell line, Nakatani
et al. (2004) found that CAMTA1 was cytosolic.

Thevenon et al. (2012) found that embryonic mice had global brain
expression of Camta1 that became restricted to the cerebellum,
hippocampi, and olfactory bulbs later in development. Camta1 was
expressed in the whole brain at embryonic day 15.5. At embryonic day
18.5, staining was marked in the cortical plate and reduced in the
ventricular zone. The olfactory system and the cerebellar anlage were
also positive. At P4, staining was found in the olfactory system, the
superficial layer of the cortical plate, the gyrus dentate of the
hippocampus, and in the vermian external granular layer of the
cerebellum. At P14, staining was restricted to the olfactory system and
the internal granular layer of the cerebellar vermis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2003) determined that the CAMTA1 gene contains 23
exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the CAMTA1
gene to chromosome 1. Nakatani et al. (2004) stated that the CAMTA1 gene
maps to chromosome 1p36.

GENE FUNCTION

Bouche et al. (2002) found that CAMTA1 and CAMTA2 activated
transcription of a reporter gene in yeast.

Song et al. (2006) showed that mouse Camta1 and Camta2 activated the Anf
(NPPA; 108780) promoter.

Using RT-PCR, Nakatani et al. (2004) found that expression of CAMTA1 was
highest in S and M phases and lowest in G0/G1 phase in synchronized
neuroblastoma cells. CAMTA2 levels did not change with the cell cycle.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using array CGH, Thevenon et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous
intragenic deletion in the CAMTA1 gene (611501.0001) in affected members
of a large family with early-onset nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia and
mild mental retardation (CANPMR; 614756). Another family with a similar
phenotype had a heterozygous intragenic duplication in the CAMTA1 gene
(611501.0002). Both of these disruptions were predicted to lead to a
frameshift and premature termination. An unrelated child with ataxia but
milder cognitive involvement had a different in-frame deletion within
the gene (611501.0003). All of the rearrangements affected the CG1
domain of the protein. DNA sequencing analysis of the CAMTA1 gene in a
cohort of 197 patients with intellectual disability or nonprogressive
cerebellar ataxia did not identify any point mutations, suggesting that
microrearrangements of the CAMTA1 are the most frequent mutations.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CEREBELLAR ATAXIA, NONPROGRESSIVE, WITH MENTAL RETARDATION
CAMTA1, 81-KB DEL, EX4

In affected members of a family with nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia
with mild mental retardation (CANPMR; 614756), Thevenon et al. (2012)
identified a heterozygous 81-kb deletion in the DNA-binding CG1 domain
of the CAMTA1 gene, resulting in the deletion of exon 4, a frameshift,
and premature termination. The deletion was identified using array CGH,
and the effects were confirmed by analysis of mRNA from patient
fibroblasts. In this family, 2 adult half sisters had mild mental
retardation, attended schools for special needs, and worked at simple
jobs. Both had ataxic gait with static instability; 1 had mild intention
tremor. Brain MRI of both women showed mild hippocampal atrophy,
simplified gyration of the dentate gyri, posterior cortical atrophy, and
cerebellar atrophy. PET scan of 1 woman showed hypometabolism of several
cerebral brain regions. One of the women had 2 affected sons, and the
other had 3 affected children. All patients had mental retardation,
usually with delayed psychomotor development, and all had gait
instability or frank ataxia. More variable features included strabismus,
infantile hypotonia, delayed speech, and myoclonic seizures of the upper
arm (1 patient). Some patients had mild dysmorphic facial features. The
mother of the women reportedly had mild intellectual disability.

.0002
CEREBELLAR ATAXIA, NONPROGRESSIVE, WITH MENTAL RETARDATION
CAMTA1, 539-KB DUP, EX3-5

In affected members of a family with nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia
and mild mental retardation (614756), Thevenon et al. (2012) identified
a heterozygous 539-kb duplication in the CG1 domain of the CAMTA1 gene.
RT-PCR analysis of patient fibroblasts showed only normal mRNA; the
quantity of mutant mRNA was lower than the sensitivity of the
experiment. In this family, a mother and her son and daughter were
affected. All had mild intellectual disability, and the mother and
daughter had ataxic gait. The 2 children had delayed psychomotor
development with speech delay. One had neonatal hypotonia and the other
had autistic features, poor interactive skills, and bursts of
aggression. Mild facial dysmorphism was noted.

.0003
CEREBELLAR ATAXIA, NONPROGRESSIVE, WITH MENTAL RETARDATION
CAMTA1, 49-KB DEL, EX2-3

In a girl with nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia with mild mental
retardation (614756), Thevenon et al. (2012) identified a de novo
heterozygous 49-kb deletion in the CG1 domain of the CAMTA1 gene,
resulting in the deletion of exons 2-3, which would not alter the
reading frame. The developmental delay in this child was not as severe
as in those with truncating mutations (see 611501.0001 and 611501.0002).

180465	TITLE *180465 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S25; RPS25
DESCRIPTION The mammalian ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species (see 180450) and
approximately 80 different proteins.

Li et al. (1991) isolated a full-length cDNA clone encoding human
ribosomal protein S25 (RPS25). The cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 125
amino acids with a deduced relative molecular weight of 13,750.

Through generation of sequence tagged sites for chromosome 11, Miwa et
al. (1993) found that 1 cosmid marker contained part of the RPS25 gene.
Imai et al. (1994) further validated its identity and, by direct
fluorescence in situ hybridization, mapped it to 11q23.3. Kenmochi et
al. (1998) confirmed the RPS25 mapping assignment reported by Imai et
al. (1994).

300375	TITLE *300375 CARBOHYDRATE SULFOTRANSFERASE 7; CHST7
;;CHONDROITIN 6-SULFOTRANSFERASE 2; C6ST2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sulfotransferases generate sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) moities
during chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis. They create considerable
structural diversity among chondroitin sulfates by transferring sulfate
with remarkable specificity for the underlying oligosaccharide
substrate. The regulated expression of each member of the
sulfotransferase gene family may be an important determinant of sulfated
GAGs expression and the associated function of chondroitin sulfates as
regulators of many biologic processes.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for members of the sulfotransferase gene
family, followed by 5-prime race using brain cDNA, Kitagawa et al.
(2000) obtained a full-length cDNA encoding CHST7, which they called
C6ST2. Sequence analysis predicted that the 486-amino acid CHST7 protein
has 4 potential N-glycosylation sites and a type II transmembrane
topology characteristic of many Golgi-localized sulfotransferases. CHST7
shares 24% and 40% amino acid identity with C6ST1 (CHST3; 603799) and
CHST2 (603798), respectively. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.4-kb
CHST7 transcript in all brain tissues tested. RT-PCR analysis showed
CHST7 expression in most fetal and adult tissues tested; a notable
exception was adult skin. In fetal tissues, expression was most abundant
in heart, lung, skeletal muscle, and spleen, while in adult tissues,
expression was most abundant in spleen. The authors noted that the CHST7
expression pattern was distinct from that of CHST3.

GENE FUNCTION

Kitagawa et al. (2000) expressed a soluble recombinant form of CHST7 in
COS-1 cells and produced an active sulfotransferase with marked
specificity for polymer chondroitin. The authors found that CHST7 and
CHST3 have distinct but overlapping acceptor substrate specificities,
with CHST7 having a more strict specificity for polymer chondroitin.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Kitagawa et al. (2000) determined that the
CHST7 gene has 2 exons and spans more than 24 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kitagawa et al. (2000) mapped the CHST7
gene to chromosome Xp11.

172470	TITLE *172470 PHOSPHORYLASE KINASE, MUSCLE, GAMMA-1; PHKG1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphorylase kinase (EC 2.7.1.38) is a crucial glycogenolytic
regulatory enzyme. The holoenzymes are composed of 16 subunit proteins
containing equimolar ratios of 4 subunit types known as alpha, beta,
gamma, and delta. Skeletal muscle contains the highest amount of
phosphorylase kinase enzymatic activity, although activity is also
observed in liver, cardiac muscle, brain, and several other tissues.
Kinetic differences exist between the cardiac and adult skeletal muscle
enzymes, and the liver and skeletal muscle enzymes are known to be
separate isozymes.

CLONING

Chamberlain et al. (1987) isolated a mouse cDNA probe for the gamma
subunit of phosphorylase kinase of muscle. RNA gel blot analysis showed
that the muscle gamma-phosphorylase kinase probe hybridized to mRNA in
skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain, but did not hybridize to
liver RNA.

Using a murine muscle phosphorylase kinase-gamma cDNA fragment to screen
a human muscle cDNA library, Wehner and Kilimann (1995) isolated the
human PHKG1 cDNA. The 387-amino acid protein shows 93 to 94% identity
with rabbit, mouse, and rat Phkg1 sequences. Northern blot analysis
revealed an approximately 3.0-kb transcript.

MAPPING

Chamberlain et al. (1987) demonstrated that the gamma subunit of
phosphorylase kinase maps to human chromosome 7, with a single band
hybridizing to chromosome 11.

Jones et al. (1990) used a rabbit skeletal muscle cDNA for the gamma
subunit of phosphorylase kinase to map the human gene to 7p12-q21
through analysis of somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization. They
interpreted the data as indicating that the gene is located just above
the centromere of chromosome 7, with further cross-hybridizing sequences
at 7q21 and 11p14-p11. The liver gamma subunit is distinct and its mRNA
did not cross-hybridize with the skeletal muscle gamma subunit cDNA. The
results indicated that the autosomal human phosphorylasse kinase
deficiency of both liver and mascle (261750) is caused by a defect in
the autosomally determined beta subunit (172490) rather than in the
gamma subunit.

Burwinkel et al. (2003) identified 2 PHKG1 pseudogene sequences on
chromosome 7q11.1 and 1 on chromosome 11p11.1-q11, which they designated
PHKG1P1-3, respectively.

Maichele and Chamberlain (1994) mapped the mouse Phkg1 gene to
chromosome 5 near the locus for beta-glucuronidase (611499).

GENE STRUCTURE

Burwinkel et al. (2003) determined that the PHKG1 gene contains 10 exons
spanning approximately 12 kb. Exon 1 is noncoding.

609870	TITLE *609870 RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 21; ARHGAP21
;;GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN, RHO, 21;;
KIAA1424;;
RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 10, FORMERLY; ARHGAP10, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ARHGAP21 functions preferentially as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP)
for CDC42 (116952) and regulates the ARP2/3 complex (604221) and F-actin
dynamics at the Golgi through control of CDC42 activity (Dubois et al.,
2005).

CLONING

By screening an adult brain cDNA library for cDNAs likely to encode
large proteins, Nagase et al. (2000) isolated a partial cDNA encoding
ARHGAP21, which they called KIAA1424. RT-PCR ELISA detected wide
expression of KIAA1424, with highest expression in brain and spinal
cord. Within brain, highest expression was in corpus callosum and
hippocampus, followed by amygdala, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, and
substantia nigra.

By searching databases for potential cytoskeletal proteins, followed by
PCR of a brain cDNA library and RACE, Basseres et al. (2002) obtained a
full-length cDNA encoding ARHGAP21, which they termed ARHGAP10. The
predicted 1,957-amino acid protein contains a pleckstrin homology (PH)
domain, a RHOGAP domain, and a PDZ domain with a glycine-rich
nucleotide-binding P loop. Northern blot analysis revealed wide
expression of a 7.5-kb transcript, with highest expression in brain,
heart, skeletal muscle, and placenta. Expression was variable in several
cancer cell lines.

Using immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses, Dubois et al. (2005)
found that ARHGAP21 was expressed as a juxtanuclear Golgi complex
protein of more than 250 kD. Its association with the Golgi complex was
reminiscent of ARF1 (103180) distribution.

GENE FUNCTION

Using real-time RT-PCR analysis, Basseres et al. (2002) showed that
hemopoietic stem cells stimulated towards myeloid or erythroid
differentiation had a marked increase in ARHGAP21 expression. They
concluded that ARHGAP21 is a cytoskeletal RHOGAP protein involved in
cell differentiation.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Dubois et al. (2005) isolated ARHGAP21
via its interaction with activated mutants of ARF6 (600464) and ARF1.
GST pull-down and mutation analyses showed that the interactions
occurred through the PH domain of ARHGAP21. RHOGAP assays indicated that
ARHGAP21 acted preferentially on CDC42 over RHOA (ARHA; 165390) and RAC1
(602048). Small interfering (siRNA) treatment of ARHGAP21 led to
constitutive activation of CDC42 that resulted in actin cytoskeleton
remodeling, suggesting that ARHGAP21 is required for Golgi complex
organization. Loss of ARHGAP21 also caused a massive
activation/recruitment of the ARP2/3 complex in the juxtanuclear region.
Dubois et al. (2005) concluded that ARHGAP21 is a downstream partner of
ARF1 that regulates Golgi structure and function through control of
CDC42 activity.

Alpha-catenin (CTNNA1; 116805) is recruited by beta-catenin (CTNNB1;
116806) after interaction of CTNNB1 with the cytoplasmic domain of
E-cadherin (CDH1; 192090), a receptor for the Listeria monocytogenes
InlA protein. By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Sousa et al. (2005) identified
ARHGAP21 as a CTNNA1-interacting partner. ARHGAP21 and CTNNA1
colocalized at cell-cell junctions, and ARHGAP21 was recruited to L.
monocytogenes entry sites. Knockdown of ARHGAP21 impaired both L.
monocytogenes entry and CTNNA1 recruitment at cell-cell contacts. In
contrast, overexpression of ARHGAP21 enhanced CTNNA1 levels at cell-cell
junctions and inhibited entry of the bacterium.

GENE STRUCTURE

Basseres et al. (2002) determined that the ARHGAP21 gene contains 25
exons and spans at least 88 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Basseres et al. (2002) mapped the ARHGAP21
gene to chromosome 10p12.32. They identified an intronless copy on
chromosome 6 that may represent a retropseudogene.

609134	TITLE *609134 UBIQUITIN-PROTEIN LIGASE E3 COMPONENT N-RECOGNIN 2; UBR2
;;CHROMOSOME 6 OPEN READING FRAME 133; C6ORF133;;
KIAA0349
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome system controls the
concentration of many regulatory proteins. The selectivity of
ubiquitylation is determined by ubiquitin E3 ligases, which recognize
the substrate's destabilization signal, or degron. The E3 ligase UBR2
participates in the N-end rule pathway, which targets proteins bearing
an N-terminal degron, or N-degron (Kwon et al., 2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) cloned UBR2, which they designated
KIAA0349. The deduced 1,275-amino acid protein shares 19.9% identity
over 710 amino acids with an S. cerevisiae N-end-recognizing protein.
RT-PCR of several tissues detected UBR2 expression only in testis.

Kwon et al. (2003) cloned mouse Ubr2. The deduced protein has a
calculated molecular mass of about 200 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Kwon et al. (2003) determined that mouse Ubr2 bound to type-1 (arg) and
type-2 (leu or phe) destabilizing N-terminal residues of a test
substrate or a 12-residue peptide. It did not bind to stabilizing (met
or gly), secondary destabilizing (asp), or type-3 destabilizing (ser,
thr, or ala) residues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kwon et al. (2003) determined that the mouse Ubr2 gene contains 48 exons
and spans about 98 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the UBR2 gene
to chromosome 6. Using radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Kwon et al.
(2003) mapped the UBR2 gene to chromosome 6p21-p11 and the mouse Ubr2
gene to the middle of chromosome 17.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kwon et al. (2003) found that Ubr2 knockout in mice was embryonic lethal
depending on both the gender and genetic background. In an inbred
strain, the Ubr2 -/- genotype was lethal to most embryos of either
gender. In a mixed background, most Ubr2 -/- females died as embryos and
Ubr2 -/- males were viable but infertile due to postnatal degeneration
of the testes. The gross architecture of Ubr2 -/- testes was normal and
spermatogonia were intact, but spermatocytes were arrested between
leptotene/zygotene and pachytene, and died through apoptosis. A
conspicuous defect of Ubr2 -/- spermatocytes was the absence of intact
synaptonemal complexes. Ubr2 +/- heterozygotes were produced at
approximately mendelian frequency and were phenotypically normal except
for reduced fertility compared with wildtype mice.

607558	TITLE *607558 SEC14-LIKE 2; SEC14L2
;;SEC14, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, 2;;
TOCOPHEROL-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; TAP1;;
TAP KIAA1186
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Hirosawa et al. (1999) cloned a partial cDNA encoding SEC14L2,
which they designated KIAA1186. RT-PCR followed by ELISA detected
moderate expression in kidney, spleen, testis, ovary, and fetal liver.
Lower levels were detected in whole brain, lung, and adult liver.

Zimmer et al. (2000) sequenced peptide fragments from bovine SEC14L2,
which they called TAP, and searched a database using these sequences to
identify human TAP. Using RT-PCR they cloned full-length TAP from human
small intestine total RNA. The deduced 403-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of about 46 kD and contains a conserved
hydrophobic lipid-binding pocket called the CRAL (cis-retinal
binding)/TRIO (triple function) domain. Human and bovine TAP share about
84% amino acid identity. mRNA dot blot analysis detected broad tissue
distribution, with highest expression in liver, prostate, and brain.
Northern blot analysis detected a major transcript of 2.8 kb and 2 minor
transcripts of approximately 4.2 and 2.8 kb expressed at highest levels
in liver and brain and more weakly in kidney.

By immunocytochemical studies, Kempna et al. (2003) showed that SEC14L2
localized to intracellular membranes of the cytoplasm in HeLa cells,
including partial localization to the ER and Golgi, with more intense
staining surrounding but not within the nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a biotinylated alpha-tocopherol derivative, Zimmer et al. (2000)
demonstrated that recombinant TAP binds alpha-tocopherol at physiologic
concentrations. Binding was dose dependent and saturable.

By ligand competition analysis, Yamauchi et al. (2001) confirmed
specific interaction between recombinant TAP and alpha-tocopherol. TAP
did not significantly interact with any other tocopherols or
tocotrienols examined. Alpha-tocopherol induced the translocation of TAP
from the cytosol to the nucleus of transfected COS-7 cells. Transient
transfection experiments showed that TAP activated transcription of a
reporter gene in an alpha-tocopherol-dependent manner. Yamauchi et al.
(2001) hypothesized that alpha-tocopherol is not only an antioxidant,
but also a transcriptional regulator via its association with TAP.

Kempna et al. (2003) showed that in HeLa cells deletion of the
C-terminal Golgi dynamics (GOLD) domain reduced SEC14L2 localization in
the region surrounding the nucleus with some tubular sacs emerging. They
suggested that the SEC14L2 GOLD domain may play a role in docking to
other proteins or in intracellular transport of bound ligands. Using
several assays, Kempna et al. (2003) demonstrated that SEC14L2 bound
tocopherol, squalene, and phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine,
phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol). Although SEC14L2 bound
phospholipids, it failed to complement an S. cerevisiae
temperature-sensitive Sec14 allele in yeast. Using immunoprecipitation
assays, Kempna et al. (2003) showed that SEC14L2 may interact with and
regulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, and SEC14L2 displayed
low basal GTPase activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zimmer et al. (2000) determined that the SEC14L2 gene contains 12 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hirosawa et al. (1999) mapped the SEC14L2
gene to chromosome 22. By genomic sequence analysis, Zimmer et al.
(2000) mapped the SEC14L2 gene to chromosome 22q12.1-qter.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Merberg et al. (1993) first detected megakaryocyte-stimulating factor
(MSF) in the urine of patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation
during a period of acute thrombocytopenia. Subsequent cloning studies
demonstrated that this 20- to 25-kD urinary metabolite of MSF was an
N-terminal cysteine-rich polypeptide component derived from a larger,
highly glycosylated precursor protein of approximately 400 kD. The
smaller urinary metabolite was shown to stimulate growth in both pure
and mixed megakaryocyte colonies from bone marrow fibrin cultures. MSF
precursor is a multifunctional domain protein with polypeptide sequence
homologies to both serum adhesive glycoproteins and secretory mucins
(see 158370). Articular cartilage MSF precursor contains large (76 to 78
repeats) and small (6 to 8 repeats) mucin-like O-ringed
oligosaccharide-rich repeat domains flanked by cysteine-rich N- and
C-terminal domains that are homologous to the somatomedin B and
hemopexin domains of vitronectin (193190), respectively.

Schumacher et al.(1994) described superficial zone protein (SZP), an
approximately 345-kD proteoglycan specifically synthesized by
chondrocytes located at the surface of bovine articular cartilage, and
also by some synovial lining cells. They demonstrated that SZP is
secreted by superficial zone chondrocytes and not by chondrocytes from
other zones of articular cartilage. SZP contains both chondroitin
sulfate and keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. SZP is extensively
degraded by papain, trypsin (276000), and pronase, but limited pepsin
(see 169700) treatment decreases its molecular mass only to 315 kD. SZP
is predominantly found in the media of explant and cell cultures.

Flannery et al. (1999) used cDNA sequencing and homology analysis to
elucidate the complete amino acid composition for the superficial zone
protein from human and bovine cartilage. They established that human
cartilage SZP is homologous with the proteoglycan first described as the
precursor protein of a megakaryocyte-stimulating factor by Merberg et
al. (1993). The cDNA encodes a protein of 1,404 amino acids with a
somatomedin B homology domain, heparin-binding domains, multiple
mucin-like repeats, a hemopexin domain, and an aggregation domain. There
are 3 consensus sequences for N-glycosylation and 1 chondroitin sulfate
substitution site. Bovine SZP and human MSF precursor sequences are
about 75% identical at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels.

Using a positional cloning approach, Marcelino et al. (1999) identified
the MSF gene within the chromosome 1q25-q31 critical region for the
autosomal recessive camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis
syndrome (CACP; 208250) locus. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that
a 4.5-kb MSF mRNA is expressed in several tissues, including liver,
lung, and heart, and is highly expressed in synovial tissue. A 30-kD
N-terminal MSF fragment was detectable in serum and urine.

By Northern blot analysis, Ikegawa et al. (2000) demonstrated limited
expression of the human PRG4 gene as 4.2- and 1.7-kb transcripts;
expression was strongest in liver, but was also observed in heart,
brain, and muscle. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated strong expression in
cartilage. RT-PCR also detected 4 types of alternative splicing. Type A
consisted of exons 1-6, type B of exons 1 and 3-5, type C of exons 1-3,
and type D of exons 1 and 3. Resultant deletions caused by skipping
these exons were all in-frame. Types A and B were expressed
ubiquitously; types C and D showed tissue-limited expression.

The cells of hematopoietic and vascular endothelial cell lineages are
believed to share a common precursor, termed the hemangioblast. Liu et
al. (2004) reported the identification of hemangiopoietin (HAPO), a
novel growth factor acting on both hematopoietic and endothelial cell
lineages. The cDNA clone encoding HAPO is an alternative splicing
variant lacking exon 5 of PRG4, as demonstrated by a comparative cDNA
sequence analysis of HAPO and PRG4. Liu et al. (2004) suggested that
HAPO may have a clinical potential in the treatment of various
cytopenias and radiation injury and in the expansion of hematopoietic
and endothelial stem/progenitor cells.

Jay et al. (2000) purified lubricin from pooled synovial fluid with
normal lubricating activity that was obtained from patients with
osteoarthritis. Purified lubricin has an apparent molecular mass of 280
kD by SDS-PAGE; deglycosylation decreased the apparent molecular mass to
120 kD. Sequencing revealed a 100% match with exons 6 to 9 of the MSF
gene. Lubricin exhibited boundary-lubricating activity similar to that
of whole synovial fluid. Jay et al. (2000) concluded that lubricin is
secreted by synovial fibroblasts. They stated that lubricin is the only
lubricating component in the final lubricating fraction of human
synovial fluid.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ikegawa et al. (2000) determined that the human and mouse PRG4 genes
each contain 12 exons and that they span 18 and 16 kb, respectively.

MAPPING

Using a positional cloning approach, Marcelino et al. (1999) identified
the MSF gene within the chromosome 1q25-q31 critical region for the
autosomal recessive camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis
syndrome (CACP; 208250) locus.

By FISH, Ikegawa et al. (2000) mapped the human PRG4 gene to chromosome
1q24-q25. By the same method they mapped the mouse mouse Prg4 gene to
chromosome 1G, in a region showing syntenic homology to human 1q24-q25.

GENE FUNCTION

Jay et al. (2007) used a multiple-particle-tracking microrheology
technique to study the molecular interaction between lubricin and
hyaluronic acid in bovine synovial fluid. They found that lubricin
affects the diffusive behavior of synovial fluid and contributes to the
elastic absorption and energy dissipation of synovial fluid at
physiologic shear frequencies. In studies involving synovial fluid from
a patient with camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis,
hyaluronic acid molecules adopted an extended and more rigid
conformation, suggesting that synovial fluid lacking lubricin would be
less able to dissipate the energy of impact that occurs during mammalian
locomotion. Jay et al. (2007) concluded that lubricin provides a
chondroprotective feature to synovial fluid that is distinct from the
role lubricin plays at the cartilage surface as a boundary lubricant.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Marcelino et al. (1999) identified 8 likely disease-causing mutations in
the MSF gene in patients with CACP from consanguineous families. Four
were homozygous deletions. Additionally, they detected a dinucleotide
transversion that created a nonsense codon, and a 41-bp insertion 14
nucleotides upstream of the intron 6 splice acceptor site that disrupted
the polypyrimidine tract of the splice site. Each of these mutations was
predicted to result in a truncated protein. Due to its high
glycosylation content and mucin-like repeats, Marcelino et al. (1999)
suggested that MSF may act as a joint/intimal cell lubricant. Both
synovial and pericardial cell hyperplasia may represent secondary
consequences of insufficient cell surface lubrication. Alternatively,
cell overgrowth may be primary to the pathogenesis of CACP.

ANIMAL MODEL

Rhee et al. (2005) generated Prg4 -/- mice, in which joints appeared
normal at birth; with aging there were abnormal protein deposits on the
cartilage surface, disappearance of underlying superficial zone
chondrocytes, and hyperplasia of intimal cells in the synovium. Purified
or recombinant lubricin inhibited the growth of those synoviocytes in
vitro. Tendon and tendon sheath involvement was present in the ankle
joints, with morphologic changes and abnormal calcification. Rhee et al.
(2005) concluded that lubricin has multiple functions in articulating
joints and tendons that include the protection of surfaces and control
of synovial cell growth.

610034	TITLE *610034 VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 33, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, A; VPS33A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By PCR of a pancreas cDNA library, Pevsner et al. (1996) obtained a
partial cDNA of human VPS33A. They cloned full-length rat Vps33a, which
encodes a deduced 597-amino acid protein. Northern blot analysis
detected several Vps33a transcripts in all rat tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

- Role of VPS33A in Ebola Virus Infection

Infections by the Ebola and Marburg filoviruses cause a rapidly fatal
hemorrhagic fever in humans for which no approved antivirals are
available. Filovirus entry is mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein
(GP), which attaches viral particles to the cell surface, delivers them
to endosomes, and catalyzes fusion between viral and endosomal
membranes. Additional host factors in the endosomal compartment are
likely required for viral membrane fusion. Using a replication-competent
vesicular stomatitis virus bearing Ebola virus GP (rVSV-GP-EboV) for a
genomewide haploid genetic screen in human cells, followed by selection
of rVSV-GP-EboV-resistant cells, Carette et al. (2011) confirmed a role
for cathepsin B (CTSB; 116810) and identified roles for NPC1 (607623)
and all 6 subunits of the HOPS complex, VPS11 (608549), VPS16 (608550),
VPS18 (608551), VPS33A, VPS39 (612188), and VPS41 (605485), in Ebola
virus entry. Subcloned cells lacking VPS11, VPS33A, or NPC1 displayed
marked resistance to rVSV-GP-EboV or Marburg virus-GP, and
susceptibility could be restored by expression of the corresponding
cDNAs. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that cells lacking
NPC1, VPS11, or VPS33A had an altered distribution of virus within
cells. Carette et al. (2011) concluded that most of the genes involved
in filovirus entry are involved in lysosome function, indicating that
filoviruses exploit this organelle differently than other viruses.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the VPS33A
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP RH44549).

602738	TITLE *602738 KARYOPHERIN BETA-1; KPNB1
;;IMPORTIN BETA-1
DESCRIPTION The import of proteins into the nucleus proceeds through the nuclear
pore complex. Cytoplasmic proteins with a nuclear localization signal
(NLS) bind to an importin-alpha (see 600685)/importin-beta heterodimer.
The trimeric complex docks to the cytoplasmic periphery of the nuclear
pore complex and is subsequently translocated through as a single
entity. The import reaction is terminated by the direct binding of RAN
(601179) to KPNB, which dissociates the importin heterodimer.

CLONING

Gorlich et al. (1995) purified a 90-kD subunit of importin (importin-90)
from Xenopus egg extracts and obtained a 188-amino acid partial protein
sequence from internal peptides. Using the partial amino acid sequence,
they isolated cDNAs encoding human importin-90, or KPNB1, from a HeLa
cell cDNA library. The sequence of the predicted 876-amino acid human
KPNB1 protein is 93% identical to the 188-amino acid partial sequence of
Xenopus importin-90. Gorlich et al. (1995) showed that Xenopus
importin-60 and importin-90 cooperate to form an import receptor that
distinguishes functional NLSs from nonfunctional ones and selectively
binds import substrates to the nuclear envelope. Independently, Chi et
al. (1995) identified cDNAs encoding human KPNB1. Based on the 97-kD
product of in vitro translation, they designated the protein p97. Using
a monoclonal antibody against bovine p97, Chi et al. (1995) localized
p97 to the cytoplasm and nuclear envelope of bovine kidney cells. These
authors found that recombinant human p97 binds zinc and that a bound
metal ion is required for nuclear envelope-binding activity. Kutay et
al. (1997) identified the regions of KPNB1 that interact with RAN,
importin-alpha, and the nuclear pore complex.

GENE FUNCTION

The guanosine triphosphatase Ran (601179) stimulates assembly of
microtubule asters and spindles in mitotic Xenopus egg extracts. A
carboxy-terminal region of the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NUMA;
164009), a nuclear protein required for organizing mitotic spindle
poles, mimics Ran's ability to induce asters. This NUMA fragment also
specifically interacted with importin-beta. Wiese et al. (2001) showed
that importin-beta is an inhibitor of microtubule aster assembly in
Xenopus egg extracts and that Ran regulates the interaction between
importin-beta and NUMA. Importin-beta therefore links NUMA to regulation
by Ran. Wiese et al. (2001) concluded that this suggests that similar
mechanisms regulate nuclear import during interphase and spindle
assembly during mitosis.

The survival of motor neuron (SMN1; 600354) protein is mutated in
patients with spinal muscular atrophy. SMN is part of a multiprotein
complex required for biogenesis of the Sm class of small nuclear
ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). Following assembly of the Sm core domain,
snRNPs are transported to the nucleus via importin-beta. Sm snRNPs
contain a nuclear localization signal (NLS) consisting of a
2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (TMG) cap and the Sm core. Snurportin-1
(607902) is the adaptor protein that recognizes both the TMG cap and
importin-beta. Narayanan et al. (2002) reported that a mutant snurportin
construct lacking the importin-beta-binding (IBB) domain, but containing
an intact TMG cap-binding domain, localized primarily to the nucleus,
whereas full-length snurportin localized to the cytoplasm. Snurportin
interacted with SMN, Gemin3 (606168), Sm snRNPs, and importin-beta. In
the presence of ribonucleases, the interactions with SMN and Sm proteins
were abolished, suggesting that snRNAs may mediate this interplay. Cell
fractionation studies showed that snurportin bound preferentially to
cytoplasmic SMN complexes. Additionally, SMN directly interacted with
importin-beta in a GST-pull-down assay, suggesting that the SMN complex
may represent the Sm core NLS receptor predicted by previous studies.
The authors concluded that, following Sm protein assembly, the SMN
complex may persist until the final stages of cytoplasmic snRNP
maturation, and may provide somatic cell RNPs with an alternative NLS.

Using a library of endoribonuclease-prepared short interfering RNAs
(esiRNAs), Kittler et al. (2004) identified 37 genes required for cell
division, one of which was KPNB1. These 37 genes included several
splicing factors for which knockdown generates mitotic spindle defects.
In addition, a putative nuclear-export terminator was found to speed up
cell proliferation and mitotic progression after knockdown.

Caudron et al. (2005) reported that the spatial cues necessary for
microtubules to reproducibly self-organize during cell division are
provided by chromosome-mediated interaction gradients between the small
guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Ran and importin-beta. This produces
activity gradients that determine the spatial distribution of
microtubule nucleation and stabilization around chromosomes and that are
essential for the self-organization of microtubules into a bipolar
spindle.

Kalab et al. (2006) examined the Ran-importin-beta system in cells by
conventional and fluorescence lifetime microscopy using a biosensor,
termed Rango, that increases its fluorescence resonance energy transfer
signal when released from importin-beta by RanGTP. Rango is
predominantly free in mitotic cells, but is further liberated around
mitotic chromatin. In vitro experiments and modeling showed that this
localized increase of free cargoes corresponds to changes in RanGTP
concentration sufficient to stabilize microtubules in extracts. In
cells, the Ran-importin-beta-cargo gradient kinetically promotes spindle
formation but is largely dispensable once the spindle has been
established. Kalab et al. (2006) observed that the Ran system also
affects spindle pole formation and chromosome congression in vivo. Kalab
et al. (2006) concluded that conserved Ran-regulated pathways are
involved in multiple, parallel processes required for spindle function,
but that their relative contribution differs in chromatin- versus
centrosome/kinetochore-driven spindle assembly systems.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Bayliss et al. (2000) described the crystal structure of a complex
between KPNB1 residues 1 to 442 and 5 tandem FxFG nucleoporin repeats
from yeast Nsp1.

Lee et al. (2003) showed the crystal structure of importin-beta
complexed with the active form of SREBP2 (600481). Importin-beta uses
characteristic long helices like a pair of chopsticks to interact with
an SREBP2 dimer. Importin-beta changes its conformation to reveal a
pseudo-2-fold symmetry on its surface structure so that it can
accommodate a symmetric dimer molecule.

To provide a basis for understanding the crucial cargo-release step of
nuclear import, Lee et al. (2005) presented the crystal structure of
full-length yeast importin-beta (Kap95) complexed with RanGTP (see
602362). Lee et al. (2005) identified a key interaction site where the
RanGTP switch I loop binds to the carboxy-terminal arch of Kap95. This
interaction produced a change in helicoidal pitch that locks Kap95 in a
conformation that cannot bind importin-alpha (see 600685) or cargo. Lee
et al. (2005) suggested an allosteric mechanism for nuclear import
complex disassembly by RanGTP.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ayala-Madrigal et al. (2000)
mapped the KPNB1 gene to chromosome 17q21. By FISH, Matsuda et al.
(1996) mapped the mouse Kpnb1 gene to the proximal end of chromosome
11D.

610097	TITLE *610097 OUTER DENSE FIBER OF SPERM TAILS 4; ODF4
;;OPPO1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nakamura et al. (2002) cloned mouse Oppo1 (Odf4), which encodes a
protein localized to the outer dense fibers of the mature sperm tail.
Using a human EST with sequence homology to mouse Odf4, Kitamura et al.
(2003) isolated human ODF4 cDNA from a testis cDNA library and ODF4
genomic clones from whole blood. The deduced 257-amino acid ODF4 protein
shares 39.9% identity with the mouse protein. By RT-PCR analysis,
Kitamura et al. (2003) detected a 768-bp transcript expressed
exclusively in testis and, by Western analysis, a 30-kD ODF4 protein in
testis and sperm. Immunofluorescence staining of ejaculated sperm
localized ODF4 to a restricted region from the neck to the middle and
principal pieces of sperm flagellae.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kitamura et al. (2003) determined that the ODF4 gene contains 3 exons
and differs from the 5-exon structure of the mouse gene; most notably,
ODF4 exon 1 extends over mouse exons 1 and 2, and the ODF4 gene lacks an
exon corresponding to exon 3 of the mouse gene.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kitamura et al. (2003) identified the ODF4
gene on chromosome 17 and the mouse homolog in a region of syntenic
homology on chromosome 11.

137780	TITLE *137780 GLIAL FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN; GFAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Glial fibrillary acidic protein is an intermediate-filament (IF) protein
that is highly specific for cells of astroglial lineage. Reeves et al.
(1989) isolated a cDNA encoding GFAP and determined its nucleotide
sequence. The predicted amino acid sequence indicated that GFAP shares
structural similarities--particularly in the central rod domain and to a
lesser degree in the carboxyl-terminal domain--with other IF proteins
found in nonepithelial cell types. Considerable sequence divergence in
the amino-terminal region of GFAP suggested that the tissue-specific
functions of this IF protein may be mediated through this region of the
molecule. GFAP is a useful marker of astroglia in the brain.

Using PS1 (104311) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Nielsen et al.
(2002) cloned a splice variant of GFAP, which they called GFAP-epsilon,
from a fetal brain cDNA library. GFAP-epsilon contains 42 amino acids
encoded by exon 7a at its C terminus in place of the 43-amino acid C
terminus encoded by exons 8 and 9 of GFAP-alpha, the originally
identified GFAP transcript.

MAPPING

Bernier et al. (1988) used cDNA probes to determine the chromosomal
location of the GFAP gene in the mouse by following its segregation in a
panel of interspecies somatic cell hybrids. Furthermore, they defined
RFLPs associated with the gene. Patterns of inheritance of these RFLPs
in recombinant inbred strains of mice showed that GFAP is encoded by a
single genetic locus on mouse chromosome 11. The murine gene is in close
proximity to the genes encoding p53 and myeloperoxidase. By Southern
blot hybridization of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization,
Bongcam-Rudloff et al. (1991) mapped the GFAP gene to human 17q21.
Brownell et al. (1991) also assigned the GFAP gene to chromosome 17 by
screening a mouse/human somatic cell hybrid panel with a GFAP cDNA
fragment.

GENE FUNCTION

Using binding assays with recombinant proteins, Nielsen et al. (2002)
determined that the unique C terminus of the GFAP-epsilon splice variant
was required for interaction with PS1, as were the coiled-coil 2 and
linker 1-2 regions shared with GFAP-alpha. GFAP-alpha did not interact
with PS1. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis of point mutations introduced into PS1
indicated that 2 nonconservative amino acid substitutions abolished
interaction with GFAP-epsilon, but 2 conservative substitutions, both
associated with Alzheimer disease, did not effect GFAP-epsilon binding.
By transfection in human embryonic kidney cells and in mouse
neuroblastoma cells, Nielsen et al. (2002)found that GFAP-epsilon
associated with intermediate filaments and perfectly colocalized with
GFAP-alpha, suggesting that both isoforms are polymerized into the same
filamentous structures. A subpopulation of GFAP-epsilon also colocalized
with PS1 in the perinuclear region and in cytoplasmic granules.

Radomska et al. (2013) stated that 3 major GFAP splice variants,
GFAP-alpha, -delta, and -kappa, are present in human central nervous
system. They found that GFAP-alpha was the dominant GFAP variant in
primary cultured human astrocytes. Knockdown of the RNA-binding protein
QKI (609590), predominantly the QKI7 variant, reduced astrocyte content
of GFAP-alpha mRNA. Treatment of astrocytes with the antipsychotic drug
haloperidol increased the expression of both QKI7 and GFAP-alpha.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Alexander disease (203450) is a rare disorder of the central nervous
system. Infants with Alexander disease develop a leukoencephalopathy
with macrocephaly, seizures, and psychomotor retardation, leading to
death usually within the first decade; patients with juvenile or adult
forms typically experience ataxia, bulbar signs and spasticity, and a
more slowly progressive course. The pathologic hallmark of all forms of
Alexander disease is the presence of Rosenthal fibers, cytoplasmic
inclusions in astrocytes that contain the intermediate filament protein
GFAP in association with small heat-shock proteins. By sequence analysis
of DNA from patients representing different Alexander disease
phenotypes, Brenner et al. (2001) found that most cases were associated
with nonconservative mutations in the coding region of the GFAP gene.
Alexander disease, therefore, represents the first example of a primary
genetic disorder of astrocytes, one of the major cell types in the
vertebrate CNS. Each mutation identified in the GFAP gene was
heterozygous, suggesting a dominant mutation. Because parental DNA was
normal in all instances where it was available, the authors concluded
that most cases of Alexander disease result from de novo mutations. It
was noteworthy that mutations in only 4 codons accounted for Alexander
disease in 10 of 11 patients, and these were all arginine codons.
Arginine codons are recognized as particularly prone to mutation,
presumably due to methylation of the CpG dinucleotide. Brenner et al.
(2001) suggested that the GFAP mutations in Alexander disease most
likely act in a dominant gain-of-function manner, as the phenotype of
Gfap-null mice is subtle and does not resemble Alexander disease. They
pointed out that the results do not exclude the possibility that defects
in other genes may be responsible for some cases of Alexander disease.
For example, Schuelke et al. (1999) reported a child with a phenotype
resembling Alexander disease (but without pathologic confirmation) who
was homozygous for a mutation in the NDUFV1 gene (161015.0003).

Rodriguez et al. (2001) searched for GFAP mutations in a series of
patients who had heterogeneous clinical symptoms but were candidates for
Alexander disease on the basis of suggestive neuroimaging abnormalities.
De novo heterozygous missense GFAP mutations were found in exon 1 or
exon 4 in 14 of the 15 patients analyzed, including patients without
macrocephaly. Nine patients carried arginine mutations that had been
described elsewhere: 4 had arg239 to cys (137780.0001); 1 had arg239 to
his (137780.0002); and 1 had arg79 to his (137780.0004). The other 5
patients had 1 of 4 novel mutations, of which 2 affected arginine and 2
affected nonarginine residues. All mutations were located in the rod
domain of GFAP, and there was a correlation between clinical severity
and the affected amino acid.

Li et al. (2005) identified mutations in the GFAP gene in 41 patients
with Alexander disease. They stated that a total of 42 different GFAP
mutations had been identified, and almost all mutations resulted in a
gain-of-function dominant effect. There was a suggestion of male
predominance of the disorder.

Li et al. (2006) determined that the paternal chromosome carried the
GFAP mutation in 24 of 28 unrelated cases of Alexander disease analyzed,
suggesting that most mutations occur during spermatogenesis rather than
in the embryo. No effect of paternal age was observed.

In 13 unrelated Italian patients with Alexander disease, including 8
with the infantile, 2 with the juvenile, and 3 with the adult form,
Caroli et al. (2007) identified 11 different mutations in the GFAP gene
(see, e.g., 137780.0005), including 4 novel mutations. Ten mutations
occurred in the rod domains and 1 in the tail domain.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Rodriguez et al. (2001) could discern a genotype-phenotype correlation
for the 2 most frequently mutated arginine residues, R79 (8 patients)
and R239 (10 patients), with the phenotype of the R79 mutations
appearing much less severe than that of the R239 mutations. The 4
patients they found with R79 mutations appeared to be the least severely
affected: none developed macrocephaly, 3 achieved independent walking,
and, at the time of report, all were alive at ages 2.5 to 20 years.
Similarly, among the 4 patients with R79 mutations who were reported by
Brenner et al. (2001), 2 lived until the ages of 14 and 48 years, the
other 2 were still alive, at ages 7 and 8 years, at the time of report
by Rodriguez et al. (2001). Patients with R239 mutations, reported by
both Brenner et al. (2001) and Rodriguez et al. (2001), had marked
impairment of psychomotor development, and some had progressive
macrocephaly.

Gorospe et al. (2002) reported 12 genetically confirmed cases of
Alexander disease caused by 9 heterozygous point mutations in the GFAP
gene. The cases demonstrated variable ages of onset and symptoms. The
authors stated that no clear-cut genotype-phenotype correlations were
apparent.

ANIMAL MODEL

Messing et al. (1998) found that overexpression of human GFAP in
astrocytes of transgenic mice was fatal and was accompanied by the
presence of inclusion bodies indistinguishable from human Rosenthal
fibers, the pathologic hallmark of all forms of Alexander disease. These
results suggested that a primary alteration in the GFAP gene may be
responsible for Alexander disease.

Gomi et al. (1995), Pekny et al. (1995), Shibuki et al. (1996), and
Liedtke et al. (1996) independently reported generation of
GFAP-deficient mice. In all cases, the mutant mice are normal at birth
and develop grossly normal. Using immunohistochemical analysis, Pekny et
al. (1995) concluded that GFAP knockout mice are lacking intermediate
filaments in astrocytes of the hippocampus and in the white matter of
the spinal cord. Using microscopic analysis of brain sections, Liedtke
et al. (1996) observed a mutant phenotype characterized by abnormal
myelination, alterations in the blood-brain barrier, disorganization of
white matter architecture and vascularization, and hydrocephalus in
older mice associated with loss of white matter. They concluded that
GFAP is necessary for the long-term maintenance of normal CNS
myelination. Shibuki et al. (1996) observed that long-term depression at
parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses is deficient in GFAP knockout
mice. Furthermore, GFAP mutant mice exhibited a significant impairment
of eyeblink conditioning without any detectable deficits in motor
coordination tasks. They concluded that GFAP may be required for
communications between Bergmann glia and Purkinje cells during long-term
depression induction and maintenance.

Hagemann et al. (2005) performed gene expression analysis on olfactory
bulbs of transgenic mice overexpressing wildtype human GFAP at 2
different ages. Expression profiles revealed a stress response that
included genes involved in glutathione metabolism, peroxide
detoxification, and iron homeostasis. Many of these genes are regulated
by the transcription factor Nfe2l2 (600492), which is also increased in
expression at 3 weeks. An immune-related response occurred with
activation of cytokine and cytokine receptor genes, complement
components, and acute phase response genes. These transcripts were
further elevated with age, with additional induction of
macrophage-specific markers, such as Mac1 (ITGAM; 120980) and CD68
(153634), suggesting activation of microglia. At 4 months, decreased
expression of genes for microtubule-associated proteins, vesicular
trafficking proteins, and neurotransmitter receptors became apparent.
Interneuron-specific transcription factors, including Dlx family members
and Pax6 (607108), were downregulated as well as Gad1 (605363) and Gad2
(138275), suggesting impairment of GABAergic granule cells. Hagemann et
al. (2005) proposed a mechanism wherein an initial stress response by
astrocytes results in the activation of microglia and compromised
neuronal function.

Hagemann et al. (2009) noted that Rosenthal fibers in the complex
astrocytic inclusions characteristic of Alexander disease contain GFAP,
vimentin (VIM; 193060), plectin (PLEC1; 601282), ubiquitin (UBB;
191339), HSP27 (HSPB1; 602195), and alpha-B-crystallin (CRYAB; 123590).
CRYAB regulates GFAP assembly, and elevation of CRYAB is a consistent
feature of Alexander disease; however, its role in Rosenthal fibers and
disease pathology is not known. In a mouse model of Alexander disease,
Hagemann et al. (2009) showed that loss of Cryab resulted in increased
mortality, whereas elevation of Cryab rescued animals from terminal
seizures. When mice with Rosenthal fibers induced by overexpression of
GFAP were crossed into a Cryab-null background, over half died at 1
month of age. Restoration of Cryab expression through the GFAP promoter
reversed this outcome, showing the effect was astrocyte-specific.
Conversely, in mice carrying an Alexander disease-associated mutation
and in mice overexpressing wildtype GFAP, which, despite natural
induction of Cryab also died at 1 month, transgenic overexpression of
Cryab resulted in a markedly reduced CNS stress response, restored
expression of the glutamate transporter Glt1 (SLC1A2; 600300), and
protected these animals from death.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG239CYS

Brenner et al. (2001) found that 5 unrelated patients with Alexander
disease (203450) were heterozygous for mutations in codon 239 of the
GFAP gene. In 4 of these, a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 729 led to
an arg239-to-cys mutation (R239C). Age at death in these 4 patients
varied from 4 years to 11 years. The fifth patient had an arg239-to-his
mutation (137780.0002). DNA was normal in the parents where available.

In a 1-year-old female with typical features of Alexander disease,
Shiroma et al. (2001) identified the frequent R239C missense mutation.
The patient was born of nonconsanguineous parents. Early developmental
milestones were normal, but at the age of 1 year she had the first
febrile seizure, and after 2 weeks she had status epilepticus with
fever. Thereafter, she lost the ability to stand with help and to speak
words. Examination showed increased head circumference (+2.3 SD) and
good social response. Plantar responses were bilaterally extensor. In
addition to the typical manifestations of macrocephaly, psychomotor
retardation, spasticity, and seizures, the radiologic findings were
typical of Alexander disease.

Rodriguez et al. (2001) found the arg239-to-cys mutation in heterozygous
state in 4 of 14 patients with infantile Alexander disease. One of the
patients was 18 months old at the time of onset, underwent deterioration
of psychomotor development at the age of 6 years, had a head
circumference of 1.5 standard deviations above the mean, and was alive
at age 8 years.

Li et al. (2005) reported 2 unrelated patients with juvenile-onset
Alexander disease who were heterozygous for the R239C mutation. One
patient had onset at age 2 years and the other at age 4 years.

.0002
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG239HIS

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450), Brenner et al. (2001)
identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 730 of the GFAP gene,
causing an arg239-to-his substitution. This infant died at the age of 11
months. Four other patients had an arg239-to-cys mutation; see
137780.0001.

Li et al. (2005) reported 5 unrelated patients with Alexander disease
resulting from the R239H mutation. All patients had a severe form of the
disease, with onset by age 6 months and death by age 5 years.

.0003
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG416TRP

In 2 unrelated patients with Alexander disease (203450) that led to
death at ages 7 and 8, respectively, Brenner et al. (2001) identified a
C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1260 of the GFAP gene, resulting in an
arg416-to-trp substitution.

Li et al. (2005) noted that the R416W mutation had been identified in
patients with infantile-, juvenile-, and adult-onset Alexander disease.

A pathologic hallmark of Alexander disease is the abundance of protein
aggregates in astrocytes. These aggregates, termed Rosenthal fibers,
contain the protein chaperones alpha-B crystallin (123590) and HSP27
(602195) as well as GFAP. Perng et al. (2006) showed that the R416W
mutation in GFAP significantly perturbs in vitro filament assembly. The
filamentous structures formed resemble assembly intermediates but
aggregated more strongly. Consistent with the heterozygosity of the
mutation, this effect was dominant over wildtype GFAP in coassembly
experiments. Transient transfection studies demonstrated that R416W GFAP
induces the formation of GFAP-containing cytoplasmic aggregates in a
wide range of different cell types, including astrocytes. Monoclonal
antibodies specific for R146W GFAP revealed, for the first time for any
intermediate filament-based disease, the presence of the mutant protein
in the characteristic histopathologic features of the disease, namely,
Rosenthal fibers. The data confirmed that the effects of the R416W GFAP
are dominant, changing the assembly process in a way that encourages
aberrant filament-filament interactions that then lead to protein
aggregation and chaperone sequestration as early events in Alexander
disease.

.0004
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG79HIS

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450) with onset at age 10 years
and death at age 48 years, Brenner et al. (2001) identified a G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 250 of the GFAP gene, leading to an
arg79-to-his substitution. Brenner et al. (2001) found the same mutation
in a patient with Alexander disease still living at the age of 8 years.

.0005
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG79CYS

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450) with onset at 3 months and
death at 14 years, Brenner et al. (2001) identified a C-to-T transition
at nucleotide 249 of the GFAP gene, leading to an arg79-to-cys (R79C)
substitution. Brenner et al. (2001) found the same mutation in a patient
with Alexander disease still living at the age of 7 years.

Caroli et al. (2007) identified the R79C mutation in 3 unrelated Italian
boys with Alexander disease. All had onset before age 10 months. One of
the patients died at age 19 years.

.0006
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG88CYS

In 2 unrelated patients with Alexander disease (203450), Rodriguez et
al. (2001) found an arg88-to-cys (R88C) mutation in the GFAP gene.

.0007
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG88SER

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450), Rodriguez et al. (2001)
found an arg88-to-ser (R88S) missense mutation in heterozygous state in
the GFAP gene.

.0008
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, LEU76PHE

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450), Rodriguez et al. (2001)
found a leu76-to-phe (L76F) heterozygous missense mutation in the GFAP
gene.

.0009
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ASN77TYR

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450), Rodriguez et al. (2001)
found a de novo, heterozygous missense mutation, asn77-to-tyr (N77Y), in
the GFAP gene.

.0010
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, GLU362ASP

In a patient with juvenile-onset Alexander disease (203450), Sawaishi et
al. (2002) identified a homozygous 1100G-C transition in the GFAP gene,
resulting in a glu362-to-asp substitution. A brother and the parents did
not carry the mutation. The mutation occurred in the C-terminal end of
the central rod domain, a highly conserved region of GFAP and other
types of intermediate filaments (e.g., vimentin (193060), desmin
(125660), keratin-1 (139350)).

.0011
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG276LEU

In 2 Japanese brothers with Alexander disease (203450), Namekawa et al.
(2002) described an 841G-T transition at nucleotide 841, resulting in an
arg276-to-leu (R276L) substitution. Both brothers had spastic paresis
without palatal myoclonus, and MRI showed marked atrophy of the medulla
oblongata and cervicothoracic cord. The autopsy showed severely involved
shrunken pyramids but scarce Rosenthal fibers. Moderate numbers of
Rosenthal fibers were observed in the stratum subcallosum and
hippocampal fimbria. One patient was well until age 33; the second
brother developed regressive spastic gait at the age of 48 years and
gradually noticed that he could not raise his left arm. The parents were
nonconsanguineous and both died in their eighth decade without apparent
evidence of a neurologic disorder. They had only the 2 offspring, both
of whom had no children. The R276L mutation was heterozygous in both
brothers. Assuming accurate attribution of paternity, one might suggest
that this represented an example of parental gonadal mosaicism.

.0012
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, LEU352PRO

In a patient with a severe form of infantile Alexander disease (203450),
Bassuk et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous 1055T-C transition in the
GFAP gene, resulting in a leu352-to-pro (L352P) substitution. Residue
352 is a highly conserved amino acid that is found in all intermediate
filament proteins and across species.

.0013
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ASP78GLU

In a family with an autosomal dominant adult form of Alexander disease
(203450), Stumpf et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous C-to-A change
in exon 1 of the GFAP gene, resulting in an asp78-to-glu (D78E)
substitution. Amino acid 78 lies in the rod domain of the protein. The
clinical phenotype varied in severity, but the pattern of evolution was
similar in all affected members. Although sleep disturbances and
dysautonomia, primarily constipation, began in childhood, the major
neurologic features began in the third or fourth decade of life. MRI of
the older patients showed atrophy of the medulla without signal
abnormalities.

114180	TITLE *114180 CALMODULIN 1; CALM1
;;PHOSPHORYLASE KINASE, DELTA SUBUNIT; PHKD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Calmodulin is the archetype of the family of calcium-modulated proteins
of which nearly 20 members have been found. They are identified by their
occurrence in the cytosol or on membranes facing the cytosol and by a
high affinity for calcium. Calmodulin contains 149 amino acids and has 4
calcium-binding domains. Its functions include roles in growth and the
cell cycle as well as in signal transduction and the synthesis and
release of neurotransmitters.

CLONING

Until the studies of Sen Gupta et al. (1987), only 1 human calmodulin
cDNA had been reported. These authors found evidence of a second
actively transcribed calmodulin gene in man. Calmodulin is the delta
subunit of phosphorylase kinase, which has 3 other types of subunits.
Although only 1 form of calmodulin has been found in humans, 3 distinct
human cDNAs have been isolated that encode the identical polypeptide
(Koller et al., 1990; Pegues and Friedberg, 1990). The existence of 3
expressible genes for calmodulin may indicate that one is a housekeeping
gene and that the additional copies are differentially regulated to
modulate calmodulin function.

Rhyner et al. (1994) detected expression of CALM1 in all human tissues
tested, although at varying levels. They identified 2 different
CALM1-related pseudogenes.

Toutenhoofd et al. (1998) found that all 3 CALM genes were expressed in
human teratocarcinoma cells. CALM1 was expressed as a major 1.7-kb
transcript and a minor 4.1-kb transcript. CALM1 was at least 5-fold less
actively transcribed than CALM3 (114183).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

To determine how calcium/calmodulin activates
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CAMK1; 604998), Chin et
al. (1997) characterized CAMK1 activation by calmodulin mutants with
substitutions at hydrophobic residues. They found that CAMK1 activity is
dependent on met124 within the C-terminal domain of calmodulin as well
as on N-terminal hydrophobic residues of calmodulin.

Kretsinger et al. (1986) described the crystal structure of calmodulin
to 3.6-angstrom resolution.

Schumacher et al. (2001) determined the crystal structure of calmodulin
bound to KCNN2 (605879). The calmodulin-binding domain forms an
elongated dimer with a calmodulin molecule bound at each end; each
calmodulin wraps around 3 alpha-helices, 2 from 1 calmodulin-binding
domain subunit and 1 from the other.

Edema factor, the exotoxin of the anthrax bacillus, is transported into
host cells by an anthrax-derived transporter, protective antigen.
Together with lethal factor (see 603060), edema factor contributes
significantly to both cutaneous and systemic anthrax and is an adenylyl
cyclase activated by CALM1. Drum et al. (2002) described the crystal
structures of edema factor alone and edema factor with CALM1 and
3-prime-deoxy-ATP. On calmodulin binding, an edema factor helical domain
of 15 kD undergoes a 15-angstrom translation and a 30-degree rotation
away from the edema factor catalytic core, which stabilizes a disordered
loop and leads to enzyme activation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rhyner et al. (1994) found that the CALM1 gene contains 6 exons spread
over about 10 kb of genomic DNA. The exon-intron structure was identical
to that of CALM3. A cluster of transcription-start sites was identified
200 bp upstream of the ATG translation-start codon, and several putative
regulatory elements were found in the 5-prime flanking region, as well
as in intron 1. A short CAG trinucleotide repeat region was identified
in the 5-prime untranslated region of the gene.

Toutenhoofd et al. (1998) determined that of the 3 CALM genes, only
CALM1 contains a canonical TATA box. Like CALM3, the 5-prime region of
CALM1 is highly GC rich.

MAPPING

McPherson et al. (1991) used a panel of human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids to demonstrate that the cDNA probe for CALM1 was localized to
chromosome 14 with cross-hybridization evident on chromosome 7 and very
weak on the X chromosome. The assignments to chromosomes 14 and 7
confirmed an earlier report by Scambler et al. (1987). McPherson et al.
(1991) tentatively assigned the CALM2 (114182) gene to chromosome 10,
but the gene was subsequently shown to be on chromosome 2. They assigned
the cDNA probe for CALM3 unequivocally to chromosome 19. There was no
apparent cross-hybridization to other chromosomes. A calmodulin
pseudogene is located on chromosome 17 (Sen Gupta et al., 1989) and
there are probably more on several other chromosomes. Berchtold et al.
(1993) assigned the CALM1 gene to chromosome 14 by PCR-based
amplification of CALM1-specific sequences using DNA from human/hamster
cell hybrids as template. Regional sublocalization was performed by in
situ hybridization using CALM1-specific DNA probes of intronic or
flanking parts of the gene; the regional localization was found to be
14q24-q31.

GENE FUNCTION

To understand the relationship between the number of calmodulin
molecules regulating each L-type calcium channel (see 114205) and the
number of calmodulin molecules privy to the local calcium signal from
each channel, Mori et al. (2004) fused L-type calcium channels to single
calmodulin molecules. These chimeric molecules revealed that a single
calmodulin molecule directs L-type channel regulation. Similar fusion
molecules were used to estimate the local calmodulin concentration near
calcium channels. This estimate indicates marked enrichment of local
calmodulin, as if a school of nearby calmodulins were poised to enhance
the transduction of local calcium entry into diverse signaling pathways.

Junge et al. (2004) identified a conserved calmodulin-binding site in
Munc13s (see 605836), which are essential regulators of synaptic vesicle
priming and synaptic efficacy. They showed that Ca(2+) sensor/effector
complexes consisting of calmodulin and Munc13s regulate synaptic vesicle
priming and synaptic efficacy in response to a residual Ca(2+)
concentration signal and thus shape short-term plasticity
characteristics during periods of sustained synaptic activity.

Dick et al. (2008) showed that the spatial calcium ion selectivity of
N-lobe calmodulin regulation is not invariably global but can be
switched by a novel calcium ion/calmodulin binding site within the amino
terminus of channels (NSCaTE, for N-terminal spatial calcium ion
transforming element). Native Ca(v)2.2 channels lack this element and
show N-lobe regulation with a global selectivity. On the introduction of
NSCaTE into these channels, spatial calcium ion selectivity transforms
from a global to local profile. Given this effect, Dick et al. (2008)
examined Ca(v)1.2/Ca(v)1.3 channels, which naturally contain NSCaTE, and
found that their N-lobe selectivity is indeed local. Disruption of this
element produces a global selectivity, confirming the native function of
NSCaTE. Thus, Dick et al. (2008) concluded that differences in spatial
selectivity between advanced Ca(v)1 and Ca(v)2 channel isoforms are
explained by the presence or absence of NSCaTE. Beyond functional
effects, the position of NSCaTE on the channel's amino terminus
indicates that calmodulin can bridge the amino terminus and carboxy
terminus of channels. Finally, the modularity of NSCaTE offers practical
means for understanding the basis of global calcium ion selectivity.

Liu et al. (2010) combined electrophysiology to characterize channel
regulation with optical fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)
sensor determination of free-apoCaM concentration in live cells. This
approach translates quantitative calmodulin biochemistry from the
traditional test-tube context into the realm of functioning holochannels
within intact cells. From this perspective, Liu et al. (2010) found that
long splice forms of Ca(V)1.3 (CACNA1D; 114206) and Ca(V)1.4 (CACNA1F;
300110) channels include a distal carboxy tail that resembles an enzyme
competitive inhibitor that retunes channel affinity for apocalmodulin
such that natural calmodulin variations affect the strength of Ca(2+)
feedback modulation. Given the ubiquity of these channels, the
connection between ambient calmodulin levels and Ca(2+) entry through
channels is broadly significant for Ca(2+) homeostasis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia 4

In a large 4-generation Swedish family with autosomal dominant
catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT4; 614916),
Nyegaard et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for a missense mutation
in the CALM1 gene (N53I; 114180.0001) that segregated fully with disease
in the family and was not found in 1,200 controls. A de novo missense
mutation in CALM1 (N97S; 114180.0002) was subsequently identified in a
23-year-old Iraqi woman with a history of cardiac arrest at 4 years of
age due to ventricular fibrillation while running. Both substitutions
demonstrated compromised calcium binding.

- Association with Osteoarthritis

In 2 independent Japanese populations totaling 428 osteoarthritis (OA;
165720) patients and 1,008 controls, Mototani et al. (2005) identified
significant association between hip OA and a -16C-T promoter SNP (dbSNP
rs12885713) in the CALM1 gene. Functional analysis indicated that the
-16T allele decreased CALM1 transcription in vitro and in vivo. CALM1
was expressed in cultured chondrocytes and articular cartilage, and its
expression was increased in OA. Inhibition of CALM1 in chondrogenic
cells reduced expression of the major cartilage matrix genes COL2A1
(120140) and AGC1 (155760). Mototani et al. (2005) suggested that the
transcriptional level of CALM1 may be associated with susceptibility for
hip OA through modulation of chondrogenic activity.

ANIMAL MODEL

A classic textbook example of adaptive radiation under natural selection
is the evolution of 14 closely related species of Darwin's finches,
whose primary diversity lies in the size and shape of their beaks. The
precise dimensions (length, depth, and width) of each species' beak are
crucial to their lifestyle and survival, and fluctuations in the
environment lead to selection that changes the relative success of birds
with various beak shapes. These evolutionary processes are evident in
real time on the Galapagos Islands (Grant and Grant, 2006). Abzhanov et
al. (2004) showed that the BMP4 gene (112262), which plays a role in
skeletal and cartilaginous development in mice, is more broadly
expressed during the embryonic development of the deep and wide beaks of
ground finches than during the development of finches with narrower
beaks. Using a cDNA microarray analysis of the transcripts expressed in
the beak primordia to find previously unknown genes and pathways whose
expression correlates with specific beak morphologies, Abzhanov et al.
(2006) found that calmodulin is expressed at much higher levels in the
long and pointed beaks of cactus finch embryos than in the beaks of
other finch embryos. They showed further that when upregulation of the
calmodulin-dependent pathway is artificially replicated in the chick
frontonasal prominence, it causes an elongation of the upper beak,
recapitulating the beak morphology of the cactus finches. The results
indicated that local upregulation of the calmodulin-dependent pathway is
likely to have been a component in the evolution of Darwin's finch
species with elongated beak morphology and provide a mechanistic
explanation for the independence of beak evolution along different axes,
e.g., broad versus elongated. More generally, their results implicated
the calmodulin-dependent pathway in the developmental regulation of
craniofacial skeletal structures.

HISTORY

Scambler et al. (1987) identified a calmodulin-like locus, designated
CALML1, on chromosome 7pter-p13 by study of somatic cell hybrids. Based
on map and other indirect evidence, Scott (2007) concluded that this
locus is a pseudogene (CALM1P2).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA, CATECHOLAMINERGIC POLYMORPHIC, 4
CALM1, ASN53ILE

In 10 affected members of a large 4-generation Swedish family with
catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT4; 614916),
Nyegaard et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for a 161A-T
transversion in exon 3 of the CALM1 gene, resulting in an asn53-to-ile
(N53I) substitution at a highly conserved residue within the first
alpha-helix of Ca(2+)-binding site II. The mutation was not found in
unaffected family members or in 1,200 controls. Functional analysis
demonstrated that the mutant had significantly reduced Ca(2+) affinity
compared to wildtype.

.0002
VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA, CATECHOLAMINERGIC POLYMORPHIC, 4
CALM1, ASN97SER

In a 23-year-old Iraqi woman with catecholaminergic polymorphic
ventricular tachycardia (CPVT4; 614916), Nyegaard et al. (2012)
identified heterozygosity for a de novo 293A-G transition in exon 5 of
the CALM1 gene, resulting in an asn97-to-ser (N97S) substitution at a
highly conserved Ca(2+)-binding residue within the high-affinity
binding-site III in the calmodulin C domain. The mutation was not found
in her unaffected parents or in 500 Danish controls, and the patient was
negative for mutation in 8 other arrhythmia-associated genes. At age 4
years, the patient underwent cardiac arrest due to ventricular
fibrillation while running; she was stabilized by treatment with a
beta-1 adrenergic receptor blocker. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed
prominent U-waves in anterior leads but no evidence for long QT or
Brugada syndromes. At 12 years of age, an off-medication exercise ECG
demonstrated ventricular ectopy with couplets and triplets of varying
morphology, which appeared to be bidirectional at times. At age 15, she
suffered a second cardiac arrest and underwent implantation of an
internal cardiac defibrillator (ICD). Functional analysis demonstrated
that the mutant had significantly reduced Ca(2+) affinity compared to
wildtype calmodulin. In addition, for the N97S mutant, calmodulin-RYR2
(180902) interaction was defective at low intracellular Ca(2+)
concentrations and restored at moderate to high Ca(2+) concentrations.

610576	TITLE *610576 RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 9; ARHGAP9
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the RHO (see ARHA; 165390) family of small GTPases are
involved in multiple signaling processes, and they are active in their
GTP-bound form and inactive in their GDP-bound form. RHO GAPs, such as
ARHGAP9, inactivate RHO GTPases by stimulating their intrinsic GTPase
activity (Furukawa et al., 2001).

CLONING

By screening a human thymus cDNA library, followed by 5-prime RACE,
Furukawa et al. (2001) cloned ARHGAP9. The deduced 731-amino acid
protein contains an N-terminal SH3 domain, followed by a WW domain, a
pleckstrin homology domain, and a C-terminal GAP domain. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.6-kb transcript in peripheral blood, spleen, and
thymus only. By phylogenetic analysis, Peck et al. (2002) determined
that the GAP domain of ARHGAP9 is most closely related to the GAP domain
of ARHGAP12 (610577).

Using RT-PCR, Takefuji et al. (2010) detected strong expression of
ARHGAP9 in T cells and monocytes, with much weaker expression in human
aortic smooth muscle cells; the product was barely detected in human
umbilical vein and human coronary artery endothelial cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Furukawa et al. (2001) determined that the ARHGAP9 gene contains 18
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Peck et al. (2002) mapped the ARHGAP9 gene
to chromosome 12q14.

GENE FUNCTION

In vitro, Furukawa et al. (2001) demonstrated that recombinant ARHGAP9
showed substantial GAP activity toward CDC42 (116952) and RAC1 (602048),
and less toward ARHA. Exogenous ARHGAP9 expression repressed the
adhesion of a human leukemia cell line to fibronectin (135600) and
collagen IV (see COL4A1; 120130). Furukawa et al. (2001) concluded that
ARHGAP9 regulates the adhesion of hematopoietic cells to extracellular
matrix.

Takefuji et al. (2010) performed a Boyden chamber assay and found that
ARHGAP9 negatively regulates cell migration. Transfection studies in
COS-7 cells demonstrated that ARHGAP9 reduced the activity of RAC1
(602048) and RAC2 (602049).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

See 610576.0001 for discussion of a possible association between
variation in the ARHGAP9 gene and susceptibility to coronary artery
spasm.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKOWN SIGNIFICANCE
ARHGAP9, ALA370SER (dbSNP rs11544238)

This variant, formerly titled CORONARY ARTERY SPASM 3, SUSCEPTIBILITY
TO, has been reclassified because its contribution to the phenotype has
not been confirmed.

Takefuji et al. (2010) analyzed 67 missense SNPs in Rho-family GTPases
and their regulators in 103 unrelated Japanese individuals with
acetylcholine-induced coronary artery spasm and 102 Japanese controls
without acetylcholine-induced coronary artery spasm. They found a
significant association between coronary artery spasm and a C-A
transversion (dbSNP rs11544238) in the ARHGAP9 gene, resulting in an
ala370-to-ser (A370S) substitution in the PH domain (odds ratio, 2.67).
Boyden chamber assay demonstrated that the ser370 mutant had a weaker
inhibitory effect on cell migration, spreading, and adhesion than
wildtype protein. Takefuji et al. (2010) suggested that ARHGAP9
variation has a critical function in the infiltration of hematopoietic
cells into the endothelium and inflammation leading to endothelial
dysfunction.

603054	TITLE *603054 GREMLIN 1 HOMOLOG, CYSTINE KNOT SUPERFAMILY; GREM1
;;GREMLIN;;
CYSTINE KNOT SUPERFAMILY 1, BMP ANTAGONIST 1; CKTSF1B1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a Xenopus expression-cloning screen, Hsu et al. (1998) isolated
GREM1, an antagonist of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP; see 112264)
signaling that is expressed in the neural crest. Gremlin-1 belongs to a
novel gene family that includes the head-inducing factor cerberus (CER1;
603777) and the tumor suppressor DAN (600613). Hsu et al. (1998) showed
that all family members are secreted proteins and that they act as BMP
antagonists in embryonic explants. They also provided support for the
model that gremlin, cerberus, and DAN block BMP signaling by binding
BMPs, preventing them from interacting with their receptors. They
proposed that gremlin, cerberus, and DAN control diverse processes in
growth and development by selectively antagonizing the activities of
different subsets of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta ligands.
By homology searches, Hsu et al. (1998) cloned the human homolog of
Xenopus gremlin. The human gremlin cDNA encodes a predicted 184-amino
acid protein.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, Topol et al.
(2000) mapped the GREM1 gene to human chromosome 15q13-q15.

GENE FUNCTION

Zuniga et al. (1999) reported that the secreted BMP antagonist gremlin
relays the Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) signal from the polarizing
region to the apical ectodermal ridge. Mesenchymal gremlin expression is
lost in limb buds of mouse embryos homozygous for the 'limb deformity'
(ld) mutation, which disrupts establishment of the Shh/Fgf4 (164980)
feedback loop. Grafting gremlin-expressing cells into ld mutant limb
buds rescued Fgf4 expression and restored the Shh/Fgf4 feedback loop.
Analysis of Shh-null mutant embryos revealed that Shh signaling is
required for maintenance of gremlin and formin (FMN1; 136535), the gene
disrupted by the ld mutations. In contrast, formin, gremlin, and Fgf4
activation were independent of Shh signaling. Zuniga et al. (1999)
concluded that the study uncovered the cascade by which the SHH signal
is relayed from the posterior mesenchyme to the apical ectodermal ridge
and established that formin-dependent activation of the BMP antagonist
gremlin is sufficient to induce Fgf4 and establish the SHH/Fgf4 feedback
loop.

Vertebrate limb outgrowth is driven by a positive feedback loop
involving SHH, gremlin, and FGF4. By overexpressing individual
components of the loop at a time after these genes are normally
downregulated in chicken embryos, Scherz et al. (2004) found that Shh no
longer maintains gremlin in the posterior limb. Shh-expressing cells and
their descendants cannot express gremlin. The proliferation of these
descendants forms a barrier separating the Shh signal from
gremlin-expressing cells, which breaks down the Shh-Fgf4 loop and
thereby affects limb size and provides a mechanism explaining regulative
properties of the limb bud.

Developmentally regulated programmed cell death sculpts the limbs and
other embryonic organs in vertebrates. In chickens and mice, Bmps
trigger apoptosis of the interdigital mesenchyme, leading to freed
digits, whereas in ducks, Bmp antagonists inhibit the apoptotic program,
resulting in webbed feet. Weatherbee et al. (2006) found the bat C.
perspicillata utilizes a unique combination of high Fgf8 (600483) and
gremlin expression to maintain interdigit tissue in the forelimb,
resulting in simultaneously elevated Fgf signaling and inhibited Bmp
signaling.

Wordinger et al. (2007) studied the effects of altered BMP signaling on
intraocular pressure (IOP) in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG; see
137760). They found that the human trabecular meshwork (TM) synthesized
and secreted BMP4 (112262) as well as expressed the BMP receptor
subtypes BMPR1 (see 601299) and BMPR2 (600799). TM cells responded to
exogenous BMP4 by phosphorylating SMAD signaling proteins (see 601595).
Cultured human TM cells treated with TGFB2 (190220) significantly
increased fibronectin (FN; 135600) levels, and BMP4 blocked this FN
induction. There was significant elevation of mRNA and protein levels of
the BMP antagonist gremlin in glaucomatous TM cells. In addition,
gremlin was present in human aqueous humor. Gremlin blocked the negative
effect of BMP4 on TGFB2 induction of FN. Addition of recombinant gremlin
to the medium of ex vivo perfusion-cultured human eye anterior segments
caused the glaucoma phenotype of elevated IOP. Wordinger et al. (2007)
concluded that these results were consistent with the hypothesis that,
in POAG, elevated expression of gremlin by TM cells inhibited BMP4
antagonism of TGFB2 and led to increased extracellular matrix deposition
and elevated IOP.

Limb development is regulated by epithelial-mesenchymal feedback loops
between SHH and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling involving the
bone morphogenetic protein antagonist gremlin-1. By combining mouse
molecular genetics with mathematical modeling, Benazet et al. (2009)
showed that BMP4 first initiates and SHH then propagates
epithelial-mesenchymal feedback signaling through differential
transcriptional regulation of Grem1 to control digit specification. This
switch occurs by linking a fast BMP4/GREM1 module to the slower
SHH/GREM1/FGF epithelial-mesenchymal feedback loop. This self-regulatory
signaling network results in robust regulation of distal limb
development that is able to compensate for variations by
interconnectivity among the 3 signaling pathways.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 8 Ashkenazi Jewish families segregating autosomal
dominant hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome mapping to chromosome
15q13.3 (HMPS1; 601228), Jaeger et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity
for an approximately 40-kb duplication centered on chr. 15:30.77 Mb that
was not found in 188 unselected Ashkenazi controls or in 935 controls
from the Colorectal Tumour Gene Identification (CORGI) study. PCR
amplification across the duplication breakpoints mapped it to chr.
15:30,752,231-30,792,051 (NCBI36), and the change was found to be a
simple tandem tail-head duplication with insertion of a 30-bp sequence
of unknown origin that had no homology to known sequences between the
duplicons. The duplication extended from intron 2 of the SCG5 gene to a
site just upstream of the GREM1 CpG island; however, only the normal
SCG5 mRNA species was found, and there were no significant differences
in SCG5 expression compared to controls. In contrast, markedly increased
GREM1 transcript levels were detected in the normal epithelium of HMPS
patients compared to controls, and allele-specific expression analysis
showed significantly increased expression of the duplicated allele in
HMPS crypts. In normal colorectal crypts of controls and unaffected
relatives, GREM1 expression was restricted to intestinal subepithelial
myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) at the crypt base, whereas in normal colorectal
crypts of HMPS patients, GREM1 was expressed not only in basal ISEMFs
but also at very high levels in epithelial cells, predominantly
colonocytes, with expression extending most of the way up the sides of
the crypts. Increased GREM1 expression was also seen in HMPS polyps, but
to a lesser extent than in normal epithelium. Jaeger et al. (2012)
demonstrated that a 3-kb region within the duplication (chr.
15:30,779,000-30,782,000, NCBI36) enhanced GREM1 expression 4-fold in
the SW948 CRC cell line and that the region interacts directly with the
GREM1 promoter. Increased GREM1 expression was predicted to cause
reduced BMP (see 112264) pathway activity, a mechanism that also
underlies tumorigenesis in juvenile polyposis of the large bowel
(174900).

ANIMAL MODEL

During limb outgrowth, signaling by BMPs must be moderated to maintain
the signaling loop between the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) and the
apical ectodermal ridge (AER). Gremlin, an extracellular BMP antagonist,
has been proposed to fulfill this function and therefore be important in
limb patterning. Khokha et al. (2003) tested this model directly by
mutating the mouse gene encoding gremlin. In the mutant limb, the
feedback loop between the ZPA and the AER was interrupted, resulting in
abnormal skeletal pattern. The phenotype is apparently identical to that
of ld, which results from a mutation in the Fmn1 gene (136535). The
relationship between Grem1 and Fmn1 is interesting because of their
proximity in the mouse genome. The Fmn1 transcript comprises a large
number of exons with the most 3-prime exon located approximately 40 kb
from the gremlin open reading frame. Given the apparently identical
phenotype of ld mice to gremlin mutant mice and the proximity of Fmn1 to
Grem1, Khokha et al. (2003) tested whether gremlin would complement ld.
They found that gremlin fails to complement ld and thus identified
another ld allele. Although a complex interaction between Fmn1 and
gremlin is possible, Khokha et al. (2003) favored the idea that the ld
mutations affect gremlin expression directly and that they lie in
cis-regulatory elements for gremlin expression.

Limb bud outgrowth is driven by signals in a positive feedback loop
involving fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) genes, Sonic hedgehog (Shh;
600725), and Grem1. Precise termination of these signals is essential to
restrict limb bud size. That the sequence in mouse limb buds is
different from that in chick limb buds drove Verheyden and Sun (2008) to
explore alternative mechanisms. By analyzing compound mouse mutants
defective in genes comprising the positive loop, Verheyden and Sun
(2008) provided genetic evidence that Fgf signaling can repress Grem1
expression, revealing a novel Fgf/Grem1 inhibitory loop. The repression
occurs in both mouse and chick limb buds and is dependent on high Fgf
activity. These data supported a mechanism where the positive Fgf/Shh
loop drives outgrowth and an increase in Fgf signaling, which triggers
the Fgf/Grem1 inhibitory loop. The inhibitory loop then operates to
terminate outgrowth signals in the order observed in either mouse or
chick limb buds. Verheyden and Sun (2008) concluded that their study
unveils the concept of a self-promoting and self-terminating circuit
that may be used to attain proper tissue size in a broad spectrum of
developmental and regenerative settings. Verheyden and Sun (2008)
demonstrated that Fgf8 (600483) repression of Fgf4 (164980) expression
is dependent on Grem1 but not Shh.

137025	TITLE *137025 FYN ONCOGENE RELATED TO SRC, FGR, YES; FYN
;;FYN TYROSINE KINASE PROTOONCOGENE;;
SRC-LIKE KINASE; SLK;;
SYN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a genomic library with a YES1 (164880) gene probe, Semba et
al. (1986) identified a related gene, which they called SYN
(src/yes-related novel gene). Northern blot analysis revealed that the
2.8-kb SYN mRNA was expressed in various cell types. The tyrosine kinase
domain of the predicted 537-amino acid SYN protein is 77 to 80%
identical to those of the YES1, FGR (164940), and chicken SRC (190090)
tyrosine kinase oncogenes. Therefore, Semba et al. (1986) concluded that
SYN is a new member of the tyrosine kinase oncogene family.

GENE FUNCTION

PrPc, the cellular, nonpathogenic isoform of prion protein (Prp;
176640), is a ubiquitous glycoprotein expressed strongly in neurons.
Mouillet-Richard et al. (2000) used the murine 1C11 neuronal
differentiation model to search for PrPc-dependent signal transduction
through antibody-mediated crosslinking. The 1C11 clone is a committed
neuroectodermal progenitor with an epithelial morphology that lacks
neuron-associated functions. Upon induction, 1C11 cells develop a
neural-like morphology, and may differentiate either into serotonergic
or noradrenergic cells. The choice between the 2 differentiation
pathways depends on the set of inducers used. Ligation of PrPc with
specific antibodies induced a marked decrease in the phosphorylation
level of the tyrosine kinase FYN in both serotonergic and noradrenergic
cells. The coupling of PrPc to FYN was dependent upon caveolin-1
(601047). Mouillet-Richard et al. (2000) suggested that clathrin (see
118960) might also contribute to this coupling. The ability of the 1C11
cell line to trigger PrPc-dependent FYN activation was restricted to its
fully differentiated serotonergic or noradrenergic progenies. Moreover,
the signaling activity of PrPc occurred mainly at neurites.
Mouillet-Richard et al. (2000) suggested that PrPc may be a signal
transduction protein.

Parravicini et al. (2002) noted that Lyn (165120) deficiency impairs
some mast cell functions, but degranulation and cytokine production are
intact. In Gab2 (606203)-deficient mice, on the other hand,
degranulation and cytokine production are impaired. Using immunoblot
analysis, they showed that although Lyn is essential for Syk (600085)
activation and Lat (602354) phosphorylation after Fcer1 (see FCER1G;
147139) aggregation, neither Lyn nor Lat are necessary for Gab2
phosphorylation. RT-PCR and coimmunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated
abundant Fyn expression in mast cells and an association with Gab2. In
cells lacking Fyn, neither Gab2 nor Akt (164730) were phosphorylated.
Functional analysis showed that Lyn -/- mast cells exhibited
hyperdegranulation and enhanced PI3K (see 601232) activity and Akt
phosphorylation, whereas in Fyn -/- mast cells the degranulation
response was inhibited. The inhibition was associated with decreased
binding of PI3K with Gab2. Parravicini et al. (2002) observed that the
degranulation response was independent of Fcer1 stimulation in
Fyn-deficient mast cells and that degranulation was dependent on PI3K in
wildtype and mutant cell lines. The degranulation response was dependent
on a rise in intracellular calcium that was inhibited in Lyn-deficient
mast cells but intact in Fyn-deficient cells. Degranulation proceeded in
Lyn -/- cells due to increased activation and constitutive
phosphorylation of the calcium-independent protein kinase C delta
isoform (PRKCD; 176977). Parravicini et al. (2002) concluded that Fyn-
and Lyn-initiated pathways synergize in late events at the level of
protein kinase C and calcium, respectively, to regulate mast cell
degranulation.

Using yeast 2-hybrid, immunoblot, and structural analyses, Chan et al.
(2003) showed that the SH2 domain of SAP (SH2D1A; 300490) bound to the
SH3 domain of FYN in a noncanonical manner and directly coupled FYN to
SLAM (SLAMF1; 603492).

Netrin-1 (601614) plays a role in the developing nervous system by
promoting both axonal outgrowth and axonal guidance in pathfinding. Liu
et al. (2004), Li et al. (2004), and Ren et al. (2004) simultaneously
reported a complex network of intracellular signaling downstream from
netrin-1 involving DCC (120470), focal adhesion kinase (FAK; 600758),
and FYN. In neurons cultured from rat cerebral cortex, Liu et al. (2004)
found that netrin-1 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and FYN, and
coimmunoprecipitation studies showed direct interaction of FAK and FYN
with DCC. Inhibition of FYN inhibited FAK phosphorylation, and FYN
mutants inhibited the attractive turning responses to netrin. Neurons
lacking the FAK gene showed reduced axonal outgrowth and attractive
turning responses to netrin. In cultured neurons from chick and mouse,
Li et al. (2004) found that netrin increased tyrosine phosphorylation of
DCC and FAK. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that DCC interacted
directly with FAK and SRC to form a complex and that FAK and SRC
cooperated to stimulate DCC phosphorylation by SRC. Li et al. (2004)
suggested that phosphorylated DCC acts as a kinase-coupled receptor and
that FAK and SRC act downstream of DCC in netrin signaling. Ren et al.
(2004) found that inhibition of FAK phosphorylation inhibited
netrin-1-induced axonal outgrowth and guidance. The authors suggested
that FAK may also function as a scaffolding protein and play a role in
cytoskeletal reorganization that is necessary for neurite outgrowth and
turning.

MAPPING

Semba et al. (1986) assigned the SYN gene to chromosome 6 by analysis of
somatic cell hybrids. Popescu et al. (1987) mapped the FYN gene to 6q21
by use of in situ hybridization. Boyle et al. (1992) confirmed the
assignment to the proximal part of 6q21 by study of a panel of 13 hybrid
cell lines containing various fragments of chromosome 6. Using a single
interspecific backcross, Justice et al. (1990) demonstrated the location
of the Fyn gene in relation to other genes on mouse chromosome 10.

ANIMAL MODEL

Grant et al. (1992) found that mice homozygous for a fyn null mutation
had impaired long-term potentiation and spatial learning. Yagi et al.
(1993) generated fyn-deficient mice by inserting the lacZ gene into the
fyn gene. Homozygous mutant mice appeared normal. However, the
homozygous fyn mutant neonates from homozygous fyn mutant parents died
because of a suckling problem. The mutant neonates suckled normally when
the fyn mutant mothers' mammary glands had been activated by suckling of
a heterozygous or wildtype pup. In homozygous mutant pups, the modified
glomerular complex of the olfactory bulb, thought to be involved in
pheromone perception, was abnormally shaped and reduced in size and the
hippocampal cell-layer was undulated. Since suckling is mediated by
pheromones, Yagi et al. (1993) speculated that the suckling problem
might be due to altered pheromone sensitivity. Yagi et al. (1993) noted
that Grant et al. (1992) did not observe a suckling defect in fyn mutant
mice. Yagi et al. (1993) suggested that this might be due to the fact
that the mice with a suckling defect had an insertional mutation in fyn,
while Grant et al. (1992) were studying mice with a null allele.

Cain et al. (1995) studied electrical kindling in mice containing a null
mutation in the fyn tyrosine kinase gene. Electrical kindling is
achieved by applying brief low intensity electrical stimuli over a
period of days to the brain, resulting in an electrical seizure focus
that may persist for months to years. The fyn mutants showed a striking
retardation in the rate of kindling, even though the phenomenon crucial
for kindling (i.e., the threshold duration and stability of epileptiform
after discharges) were normal. This implied to the authors that function
of the fyn gene is required for normal epileptogenesis.

SYK controls pre-B cell development but does not affect NFKB (164011)
induction. Saijo et al. (2003) showed that mice triple-deficient in the
Src family protein tyrosine kinases (SFKs) Blk (191305), Fyn, and Lyn,
but not single-deficient or Syk-deficient mice, had impaired Nfkb
induction and B-cell development. The impairment of Nfkb induction could
be overcome by protein kinase C-lambda (see 176982) activation. Saijo et
al. (2003) suggested that there are 2 separate pathways in pre-B cell
receptor signaling, one SFK-dependent and the other SYK-dependent, that
contribute critically to pre-B cell development.

601613	TITLE *601613 CHEMOKINE, CXC MOTIF, RECEPTOR 5; CXCR5
;;BURKITT LYMPHOMA RECEPTOR 1; BLR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dobner et al. (1992) and Kaiser et al. (1993) identified a novel member
of the G protein-coupled receptor family termed BLR1 (BLR1 having been
identified from Burkitt lymphoma).

GENE FUNCTION

B lymphocytes recirculate between B cell-rich compartments (follicles or
B zones) in secondary lymphoid organs, surveying for antigen. After
antigen binding, B cells move to the boundary of B and T zones to
interact with T-helper cells. Reif et al. (2002) demonstrated that
antigen-engaged B cells have increased expression of CCR7 (600242), the
receptor for the T-zone chemokines CCL19 (602227) and CCL21 (602737),
and that they exhibit increased responsiveness to both chemoattractants.
In mice lacking lymphoid CCL19 and CCL21 chemokines, or with B cells
that lack CCR7, antigen engagement fails to cause movement to the T
zone. Using retroviral-mediated gene transfer, the authors demonstrated
that increased expression of CCR7 is sufficient to direct B cells to the
T zone. Reciprocally, overexpression of CXCR5, the receptor for the
B-zone chemokine CXCL13 (also known as BLC), is sufficient to overcome
antigen-induced B-cell movement to the T zone. Reif et al. (2002)
concluded that their findings defined the mechanism of B-cell
relocalization in response to antigen, and established that cell
position in vivo can be determined by the balance of responsiveness to
chemoattractants made in separate but adjacent zones.

Chan et al. (2003) investigated the expression of chemokines and
chemokine receptors in eyes with primary intraocular B-cell lymphoma
(PIOL). All 3 PIOL eyes showed similar pathology, with typical diffuse
large B-lymphoma cells between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and
Bruch membrane. The eyes also showed a similar chemokine profile with
the expression of CXCR4 (162643) and CXCR5 in the lymphoma cells. CXCL13
(BLC) and CXCL12 (600835) transcripts were found only in the RPE and not
in the malignant cells. No chemokine expression was detected on the RPE
cells of a normal control eye. Since chemokines and chemokine receptors
selective for B cells were identified in RPE and malignant B cells in
eyes with PIOL, inhibition of B-cell chemoattractants might be a future
strategy for the treatment of PIOL.

The germinal center (GC) is organized into dark and light zones. B cells
in the dark zone, called centroblasts, undergo rapid proliferation and
somatic hypermutation of their antibody variable genes. Centroblasts
then become smaller, nondividing centrocytes and undergo selection in
the light zone based on the affinity of their surface antibody for the
inducing antigen. The light zone also contains helper T cells and
follicular dendritic cells that sequester antigen. Failure to
differentiate results in centrocyte apoptosis, whereas centrocytes that
bind antigen and receive T-cell help emigrate from the GC as long-lived
plasma cells or memory B cells. Some centrocytes may also return to the
dark zone for further proliferation and mutation. Using genetic and
pharmacologic approaches, Allen et al. (2004) showed that CXCR4 was
essential for GC dark and light zone segregation. In the presence of the
antiapoptotic BCL2 (151430), B cells had robust chemotactic responses to
the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12, as well as to CXCL13, the ligand for CXCR5.
CXCL12 was more abundant in the dark zone, and CXCR4 was more abundant
on centroblasts than centrocytes. In contrast, CXCR5 helped direct cells
to the CXCL13-positive light zone, but was not essential for segregation
of the 2 zones. CXCL13 and CXCR5 were required for correct positioning
of the light zone. Allen et al. (2004) concluded that these chemokines
and their receptors are critical for movement of cells to different
parts of the GC and for creating the distinct histologic appearance of
the GC.

Using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, Cagigi et al. (2008)
found that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see
609423)-seropositive patients, particularly those with low CD4
(186940)-positive T-cell counts, had reduced expression of CXCR5 on B
cells, whereas expression of its ligand, CXCL13, was increased. CXCL13
was secreted upon B-cell activation. CXCL13-positive B cells were
present in lymph nodes of HIV-1-seropositive patients, but not in
control tissue. Cagigi et al. (2008) concluded that altered expression
of CXCR5 and CXCL13 may be involved in B-cell dysfunction during HIV-1
infection.

ANIMAL MODEL

Forster et al. (1996) described the phenotype of gene-targeted mice
lacking the putative chemokine receptor Blr1. In normal mice, this
receptor is expressed on mature B cells and a subpopulation of T helper
cells. Blr1-mutant mice lack inguinal lymph nodes and possess no or only
a few phenotypically abnormal Peyer patches. The migration of
lymphocytes into splenic follicles was severely impaired, resulting in
morphologically altered primary lymphoid follicles. Furthermore,
activated B cells failed to migrate from the T cell-rich zone into
B-cell follicles of the spleen, and despite high numbers of germinal
center founder cells, no functional germinal centers developed in this
organ. These results identified BLR1 as the first G protein-coupled
receptor involved in B cell migration and localization of these cells
within specific anatomic compartments.

CXCR5 was known to be required for B cell migration to splenic
follicles, but the requirements for homing to B-cell areas and lymph
nodes remained to be defined. Ansel et al. (2000) demonstrated that
lymph nodes contain 2 types of B cell-rich compartment: follicles
containing follicular dendritic cells, and areas lacking such cells.
Ansel et al. (2000) generated mice deficient in the B-lymphocyte
chemoattractant (BLC; 605149), for which CXCR5 is the receptor, by
targeted disruption. BLC-deficient mice were similar in appearance to
mice deficient in CXCR5. However, CXCR5-deficient mice have less severe
deficiency in Peyer patches. Using BLC-deficient mice, Ansel et al.
(2000) established that BLC and CXCR5 are needed for B-cell homing to
follicles in lymph nodes as well as in spleen. They also found that BLC
is required for the development of most lymph nodes and Peyer patches.
In addition to mediating chemoattraction, BLC induces B cells to
upregulate membrane lymphotoxin alpha-1-beta-2 (see 600978), a cytokine
that promotes follicular dendritic cell development and BLC expression,
establishing a positive feedback loop thought to be important in
follicle development and homeostasis. In germinal centers, the feedback
loop is overridden, with B cell lymphotoxin alpha-1-beta-2 expression
being induced by a mechanism independent of BLC.

Voigt et al. (2000) found that B cells and dendritic cells do
colocalize, albeit aberrantly, even in the absence of CXCR5. In mice
lacking Cxcr5, both cell types were found in a broad ring around the
sinuses of the marginal zones. Voigt et al. (2000) concluded that in
Cxcr5-deficient mice, the organization of splenic primary follicles is
severely impaired. However, within the T cell zone a microenvironment is
built up, which provides all requirements needed for the affinity
maturation to take place.

Prinz et al. (2003) found that in mice deficient in Cxcr5 the follicular
dendritic cells (FDCs) are juxtaposed to major splenic nerves and the
transfer of intraperitoneally-administered prions (see 176640) into the
spinal cord is accelerated. Neuroinvasion velocity correlated
exclusively with the relative locations of FDCs and nerves; transfer of
Cxcr5 -/- bone marrow to wildtype mice induced perineural FDCs and
enhanced neuroinvasion, whereas reciprocal transfer to Cxcr5 -/- mice
abolished them and restored normal efficiency of neuroinvasion.
Suppression of lymphotoxin signaling depleted FDCs, abolished splenic
infectivity, and suppressed acceleration of pathogenesis in Cxcr5 -/-
mice. Prinz et al. (2003) concluded that their data suggests that prion
neuroimmune transition occurs between FDCs and sympathetic nerves, and
relative positioning of FDCs and nerves controls the efficiency of
peripheral prion infection.

602284	TITLE *602284 BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN 8B; BMP8B
;;BMP8;;
OSTEOGENIC PROTEIN 2; OP2
DESCRIPTION The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a family of secreted
signaling molecules that can induce ectopic bone growth. Many BMPs,
including BMP8B, are part of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB)
superfamily (see 190180) (Ozkaynak et al., 1992).

CLONING

Using a mouse Op2 probe, Ozkaynak et al. (1992) isolated a novel BMP
cDNA, which they designated OP2, from a human hippocampus library. The
predicted 402-amino acid OP2 protein is processed into a 139-amino acid
mature form. In the TGFB domain, OP2 shows 74% amino acid sequence
identity to OP1 (BMP7; 112267), and 55 to 74% identity to other BMPs. In
mice, Northern blot analysis revealed high levels of Op2 mRNA as 3- and
5-kb transcripts in early embryos, but no detectable levels in any
organs studied.

Using quantitative RT-PCR, Whittle et al. (2012) detected variable Bmp8b
expression in all mouse tissues examined, with high expression in testis
and brown adipose tissue, much lower expression in brain and
subcutaneous white adipose tissue, and very low expression in gonadal
white adipose tissue, liver, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle.

MAPPING

By interspecific backcross analysis, DiLeone et al. (1997) mapped the
mouse Bmp8 gene to chromosome 4. Based on homology of synteny, they
mapped the human gene to 1p35-p32.

Hartz (2012) mapped the BMP8B gene to chromosome 1p34.2 based on an
alignment of the BMP8B sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC023526) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Whittle et al. (2012) found that expression of Bmp8b in mice was
upregulated by refeeding after fasting and by activation of thermogenic
responses. Reporter gene assays revealed that the Bmp8b promoter could
be induced by thermogenic thyroid hormone receptor beta-1 (THRB; 190160)
and by PPAR-alpha (PPARA; 170998) or PPAR-gamma (PPARG; 601487).
Treatment of mouse brown adipocytes with recombinant human BMP8B
increased Smad (see 601595) phosphorylation and activation of
hormone-sensitive lipase (LIPE; 151750) and AMPK (see 602739). BMP8B
increased the lipolytic response to norepinephrine, and inhibition of
Alk7 (ACVR1C; 608981) antagonized this effect.

ANIMAL MODEL

Whittle et al. (2012) reported that Bmp8b -/- mice were viable and
healthy but infertile due to defective primordial germ cell formation. A
significant number of Bmp8b -/- pups suffered early death, but survival
increased in a warm environment. Bmp8b -/- mice were prone to weight
gain, particularly on a high fat diet, and they showed reduced core body
temperature and impaired adrenergic-dependent thermogenic capacity.
Intracerebroventricular treatment of Bmp8b -/- mice with recombinant
human BMP8B resulted in marked weight loss and increased core body
temperature. The central thermogenic action of BMP8B was dependent upon
activation levels of hypothalamic Ampk. Whittle et al. (2012) concluded
that BMP8B has a fundamental role in energy balance regulation in both
the hypothalamus and brown adipose tissue.

602204	TITLE *602204 BICAUDAL D, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; BICD1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

From the early part of the 20th century, embryologists recognized that
the cytoplasmic asymmetry established in the egg during oogenesis
directs the proper spatial development of the embryo. Development of
this polarity in the Drosophila oocyte depends also on the correct
sorting of maternal RNAs. Bicaudal D is a Drosophila protein that is
involved in establishing the asymmetric cytoplasm in the developing
oocyte. The gene encodes a cytoskeleton-like coiled-coil polypeptide,
with a leucine zipper and 5 alpha-helix domains or heptad repeats
showing sequence similarity to the tail domains of myosin heavy chains
(e.g., 160730), the microtubule motor kinesin (see 600025), and
intermediate filament proteins. Baens et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA
fragment homologous to bicaudal D using a hybridization selection
procedure with cosmids derived from 12p. A PCR-mediated cDNA cloning
strategy was applied by Baens and Marynen (1997) to obtain the coding
sequence of the human homolog (BICD1) and to generate a partial mouse
gene cDNA. They found that predicted amino acid sequence similarity of
the BICD1 cDNA was limited essentially to the amphipatic helices and the
leucine zipper, but the conserved order of these domains suggested a
function of the protein in mammals similar to that in Drosophila. A
database search further indicated the existence of a second human
homolog on 9q and a Caenorhabditis elegans homolog. Northern blot
analysis indicated that both the human and the murine homologs produce
an mRNA species of approximately 9.5 kb expressed in brain, heart, and
skeletal muscle, as well as during mouse embryonic development. The
conserved structural characteristics of BICD1 protein and its expression
in muscle and especially brain suggested to Baens and Marynen (1997)
that BICD1 is a component of a cytoskeleton-based mRNA sorting mechanism
conserved during evolution.

GENE FUNCTION

Bullock and Ish-Horowicz (2001) demonstrated in Drosophila that the same
machinery and RNA signals drive specific accumulation of maternal RNAs
in the early oocyte and apical transcript localization in blastoderm
embryos. They demonstrated in vivo that Egalitarian (Egl) and bicaudal D
(BicD), maternal proteins required for oocyte determination, are
selectively recruited by, and cotransported with, localizing transcripts
in blastoderm embryos, and that interfering with the activities of Egl
and BICD blocks apical localization.

the BICD1 gene and leukocyte telomere length in humans, see 609113.

612897	TITLE *612897 SEPTIN 1; SEPT1
;;DIFF6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nottenburg et al. (1990) cloned mouse Sept1, which they called Diff6.
The deduced protein has a putative leucine zipper and a calculated
molecular mass of 43.5 kD.

Using full-length Aurora B kinase (AURKB; 604970) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a fetal liver cDNA library, Qi et al. (2005) cloned
human SEPT1. SEPT1 belongs to a conserved family of GTPases.
Fluorescence-tagged SEPT1 localized to the midbody of HeLa cells during
cytokinesis, but it remained at the centrosomes and nearby microtubule
region throughout mitosis. It colocalized with Aurora B during
cytokinesis.

GENE FUNCTION

Using protein pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation of
epitope-tagged proteins, Qi et al. (2005) confirmed that SEPT1
interacted with Aurora B. Aurora B phosphorylated SEPT1 on ser248,
ser307, and ser315 in vitro.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the SEPT1 gene to chromosome 16p11.2 based on an
alignment of the SEPT1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC012161) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

606467	TITLE *606467 ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE 8 FAMILY, MEMBER A1; ALDH8A1
;;ALDH12
DESCRIPTION Retinal dehydrogenase isozymes (e.g., RALDH1; 100640) are members of the
ALDH family. Short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases convert all-trans- and
9-cis-retinol to all-trans- and 9-cis-retinal, while RALDH isozymes
convert these into all-trans-retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid,
respectively.

CLONING

By biochemical purification of rat kidney and liver Raldh isozymes,
micropeptide sequencing, and genomic database analysis, followed by
5-prime and 3-prime RACE and PCR of a human kidney cDNA library, Lin and
Napoli (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding ALDH8A1, which they termed
ALDH12. Sequence analysis predicted that the 487-amino acid ALDH8A1
protein contains the 23 invariant residues and 4 conserved regions
typical of the ALDH superfamily. It also has a cofactor-binding motif
and a cys residue that serves as an active-site nucleophile. Northern
blot analysis revealed expression of a 2.5-kb ALDH8A1 transcript only in
liver and kidney. Dot-blot analysis detected low expression in brain and
spinal cord and detectable expression in mammary gland, thymus, adrenal,
testis, prostate, and parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Functional
analysis showed increased RALDH activity of ALDH8A1, with greater
efficiency for 9-cis-retinal, from pH7 to pH9 in vitro and in intact
cells in the presence of type-1 cis-retinol androgen dehydrogenase
(CRAD1). Lin and Napoli (2000) also identified an ALDH8A1 splice variant
missing 1 exon and encoding a 433-amino acid protein that lacks 2 of the
invariant residues, including the active-site nucleophile.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ALDH8A1
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP sts-N70701).

603071	TITLE *603071 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 17; GPR17
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily contain 7
transmembrane domains and transduce extracellular signals through
heterotrimeric G proteins. By PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides
based on regions conserved between IL8RA (146929) and the angiotensin II
chemokine GPCR (106165), Raport et al. (1996) isolated the GPR17 gene,
which they called R12. Independently, Blasius et al. (1998) used RT-PCR
to identify novel P2 nucleotide (P2Y) GPCRs (see 601167) and isolated
GPR17 cDNAs. They identified 2 GPR17 splice variants, designated HIP4
and FB1, which encode predicted proteins of 339 and 367 amino acids,
respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that human GPR17 is
expressed as 2.3- and 6.3-kb mRNAs exclusively in brain. The 2
transcripts appear to represent alternatively polyadenylated variants.
Based on protein sequence homology and the conservation of certain key
residues, GPR17 appears to be closely related to the P2Y family of
GPCRs. However, Blasius et al. (1998) stated that preliminary functional
data did not support the hypothesis that classical P2Y agonists serve as
ligands for this receptor.

GENE FUNCTION

Ciana et al. (2006) expressed GPR17 in different cell lines and found
that stimulation with both uracil nucleotides and cysteinyl-leukotrienes
(CysLTs) resulted in specific and concentration-dependent responses. In
vivo, knockdown of Gpr17 by either CysLT receptor (CYSLTR1; 300201) or
P2Y receptor (e.g., P2RY12; 600515) antagonists or by antisense
technology prevented evolution of brain damage in a rat focal ischemia
model. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of GPR17 in human and rat
organs prone to ischemic damage, including brain, kidney, and heart.
GPR17 appeared to possess 2 distinct binding sites, one for nucleotides
and the other for CysLTs. Ciana et al. (2006) concluded that GPR17 is a
common molecular target that may mediate ischemia and inflammatory
effects induced by nucleotides and CysLTs.

Using mouse cDNAs, Maekawa et al. (2009) showed that Gpr17 downregulated
the function, but not the membrane localization, of the cysteinyl
leukotriene receptor Cyslt1r (CYSLTR1; 300201). Cotransfection of Gpr17
with Cyslt1r suppressed LTD4 binding and inhibited Cyslt1r-mediated Erk
(see MAPK1; 176948) phosphorylation in response to LTD4.
Coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed that Gpr17 and Cyslt1r interacted
directly. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed colocalization
of GPR17 and CYSLT1R on the surface of human peripheral blood monocytes.
Silencing of Gpr17 in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages increased
Cyslt1r membrane expression and increased the magnitude and sensitivity
to LTD4-induced calcium flux. Gpr17 deficiency in mice increased
Cyslt1r-mediated vascular permeability in IgE-dependent mast
cell-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. The vascular leak in
Gpr17-deficient mice was markedly and significantly suppressed by
pharmacologic inhibition of Cyslt1r. Maekawa et al. (2009) concluded
that GPR17 functions as a negative regulator of CYSLT1R.

Mouse hypothalamic neurons expressing Agrp (602311) are involved in
feeding behavior. Ren et al. (2012) found that ablation of Foxo1
(136533) specifically in Agrp-positive hypothalamic neurons resulted in
reduced food intake, leanness, improved glucose homeostasis, and
increased sensitivity to leptin and insulin in mice. Quantitative PCR
and microarray analysis showed that Gpr17 was highly expressed in
Agrp-positive mouse neurons and that Gpr17 expression increased during
fasting. Gpr17 expression was decreased in Foxo1-deficient Agrp-positive
neurons. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that Foxo1
bound the Gpr17 promoter. Ren et al. (2012) concluded that
downregulation of Gpr17, at least in part, mediates the anorexigenic
phenotype of Foxo1-deficient Agrp-positive neurons.

GENE STRUCTURE

Blasius et al. (1998) noted that the organization of the GPR17 gene
differs from that of many other GPCRs in that the ORF is distributed on
2 exons, with an additional exon containing the 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Raport et al. (1996) mapped the R12
gene to chromosome 2. Blasius et al. (1998) regionalized the HIP4/FB1
gene to chromosome 2q21 using fluorescence in situ hybridization.

610909	TITLE *610909 MINICHROMOSOME MAINTENANCE COMPLEX-BINDING PROTEIN; MCMBP
;;CHROMOSOME 10 OPEN READING FRAME 119; C10ORF119
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNA replication is a carefully orchestrated process involving many
proteins that assemble at origins of replication. Among these are the 6
proteins of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex (e.g., MCM2;
116945), which form a hexamer. Each MCM subunit performs an essential
function in initiation and elongation of DNA replication. MCMBP can
replace MCM2 in the MCM complex, thus forming an alternative MCM hexamer
(Sakwe et al., 2007).

CLONING

By purifying MCM6 (601806)- and MCM7 (600592)-containing complexes from
human 293T cells, followed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, Sakwe et
al. (2007) identified MCMBP as a 65-kD MCM complex-binding protein. The
640-amino acid MCMBP protein shares limited homology with members of the
MCM family and is highly conserved in multicellular eukaryotes.
Immunofluorescence microscopy showed extensive nuclear localization of
MCMBP in HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunofluorescence microscopy and cellular fractionation, Sakwe et
al. (2007) showed that MCMBP bound to chromatin in a manner typical of
MCM proteins, and that MCMBP was preferentially associated with a
cellular origin in G1 but not S phase. In vivo tagging experiments,
coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous MCM proteins in HeLa cells, and
analysis of recombinant MCM complexes in insect cells revealed that
MCMBP formed a hexamer with MCM3 (602693) through MCM7 that excluded
MCM2; conversely, the hexamer of MCM2 through MCM7 excluded MCMBP. MCMBP
also formed a complex with the MCM4 (602638)/MCM6/MCM7 core helicase in
vitro, but, unlike MCM2, MCMBP did not inhibit helicase activity. Sakwe
et al. (2007) concluded that 2 forms of MCM complexes occur, those with
MCM2 and those in which MCMBP replaces MCM2.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MCMBP
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP A005M41).

611911	TITLE *611911 IRON-SULFUR CLUSTER SCAFFOLD, E. COLI, HOMOLOG OF; ISCU
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are prosthetic groups found in respiratory
chain complexes and numerous mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes.
Assembly of Fe-S clusters requires scaffold proteins, such as ISCU, as
well as cysteine desulfurases, iron donors, and chaperones (Li et al.,
2006).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologs of yeast Isu proteins,
followed by 5-prime RACE of heart and liver RNA, Tong and Rouault (2000)
cloned 2 ISCU splice variants, ISCU1 and ISCU2. Both variants share the
same transcription initiation site, but they differ in the presence
(ISCU1) or absence (ISCU2) of exon 1B. ISCU1 encodes a deduced 142-amino
acid protein with 13 unique N-terminal residues, and ISCU2 encodes a
deduced 167-amino acid protein with 38 unique N-terminal residues,
including a mitochondrial targeting signal. They have predicted
molecular masses of 15.4 and 17.9 kD, respectively. Northern blot
analysis with specific probes detected endogenous ISCU1 and ISCU2
transcripts of 1.4 and 1.3 kb, respectively, in heart and RD4
rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Northern blot analysis of a human tissue panel
using a common probe detected a 1.35-kb transcript expressed
predominantly in heart and skeletal muscle. Immunofluorescence
microscopy of transfected COS cells showed that ISCU1 localized to
cytosol and nucleus, whereas ISCU2 colocalized with a mitochondrial
marker. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of fractionated
RD4 cells detected an endogenous ISCU1 protein of 15 kD. ISCU2 appeared
to undergo rapid 2-step processing, with proteolytic cleavage at glu27
and then at tyr35, resulting in a mature protein of about 14 kD. A 19-kD
form of cytosolic ISCU was also detected.

GENE STRUCTURE

Olsson et al. (2008) noted that the ISCU gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ISCU
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP D12S1907).

In a study of patients with hereditary myopathy and lactic acidosis
(255125), Mochel et al. (2008) found that the ISCU gene lies in a region
of homozygosity for that disorder on chromosome 12q24.11.

GENE FUNCTION

ISCS (NFS1; 603485) is a cysteine desulfurase thought to sequester
inorganic sulfur for Fe-S cluster assembly. By coimmunoprecipitation and
Western blot analysis of fractionated RD4 cells, Tong and Rouault (2000)
found that the mitochondrial and cytosolic ISCU isoforms associated with
the mitochondrial and cytosolic ISCS isoforms in their respective
fractions, suggesting that separate Fe-S cluster assembly complexes
exist in the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments.

Using isoform-specific small interfering RNA in HeLa cells, Tong and
Rouault (2006) showed that the mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms of
ISCU were necessary for the activities of mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2;
100850) and cytosolic aconitase (ACO1; 100880), respectively. In
addition, knockdown of the ISCU isoforms inappropriately activated the
iron regulatory element-binding activities and iron regulatory functions
of ACO1 and IREB2 (147582) and disrupted intracellular iron homeostasis.
Endogenous ISCU levels were depressed by iron deprivation. Tong and
Rouault (2006) concluded that ISCU is involved in a coordinated response
to iron deficiency that includes activation of iron uptake,
redistribution of intracellular iron, and decreased utilization of iron
in Fe-S proteins.

Li et al. (2006) found that the cytosolic isoforms of human ISCS and
ISCU formed a complex in vitro. When incubated with IRP1 (ACO1),
cysteine, and iron, the cytosolic forms of ISCS and ISCU facilitated
formation of a 4Fe-4S cluster on IRP1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

A myopathy with severe exercise intolerance and myoglobinuria (255125)
has been described as an autosomal recessive trait in patients from
northern Sweden, with associated deficiencies of succinate dehydrogenase
and aconitase in skeletal muscle. Mochel et al. (2008) identified the
ISCU gene as a candidate within a region of shared homozygosity on
chromosome 12q in 3 patients from 3 families with this disorder. They
identified a homozygous intronic G-to-C transversion (7044G-C, or
IVS5+382G-C; 611911.0001) in the ISCU gene in all 3 affected
individuals. The mutation strengthened a weak splice acceptor site
within intron 5, leading to retention of a 100-bp intronic sequence and
resulting in 15 amino acids and a premature stop codon. A marked
reduction of ISCU mRNA and mitochondrial ISCU protein in patient muscle
was associated with a decrease in the iron regulatory protein IRP1
(100880) and intracellular iron overload in skeletal muscle, consistent
with a muscle-specific alteration of iron homeostasis in this disorder.
ISCU interacts with the Friedreich ataxia (FRDA; 229300) gene product
frataxin (FXN; 606829) in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis.

In 15 affected members from 9 families with hereditary myopathy and
lactic acidosis, Olsson et al. (2008) independently mapped the locus to
chromosome 12q23.2-q24.11 (maximum lod score of 5.26 at D12S84). They
identified homozygosity for the intronic G-to-C transversion in the ISCU
gene in all affected individuals.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nordin et al. (2011) found that Iscu -/- mice were embryonic lethal. No
homozygous null embryos were identified at embryonic day (E) 7.5 to
10.5, but at E3.5, 2 of 9 embryos were homozygous for the null allele,
suggesting that Iscu is important for the implantation or early
development of the embryo. In contrast, Iscu +/- mice showed no apparent
physical impairment and were similar to the wildtype mice. Tissue from
heterozygous mice showed decreased levels of Iscu protein, but the
reduction was less than 50%, suggesting upregulation of the functional
allele.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYOPATHY WITH LACTIC ACIDOSIS, HEREDITARY
ISCU, IVS5, G-C, +382

from northern Sweden, Mochel et al. (2008) found homozygosity for an
intronic G-to-C transversion (7044G-C, or IVS5+382G-C) in the ISCU gene.
There were 3 heterozygous carriers of the mutation among 568 Swedish
chromosomes, resulting in a frequency of approximately 1 in 188 in this
population. Western blot analysis of patient muscle showed a substantial
reduction of the normal mitochondrial isoform (ISCU2) compared to
controls. The mutation was thought to strengthen a weak splicing
acceptor site, with consequent retention of a 100-bp intronic sequence
upstream of the known terminal exon, introduction of a stop codon, and
decreased levels of ISCU mRNA and protein. The depletion of
mitochondrial ISCU in muscle would account for the biochemical and
clinical phenotype, which is characterized by a deficiency in
mitochondrial iron-sulfur proteins and impaired muscle oxidative
metabolism.

Independently, Olsson et al. (2008) identified homozygosity the G-to-C
transversion in intron 5 of the ISCU gene in 15 affected members from 9
families with hereditary myopathy and lactic acidosis. RT-PCR studies
showed aberrant splicing of the ISCU mRNA in patient muscle biopsies
compared to controls, with significantly decreased levels of the
mitochondrial ISCU2 isoform. However, patient mRNA did not correspond to
the cytosolic ISCU1 isoform; rather, patient mRNA contained a 100-bp
sequence from intron 5, inserted between exons 4 and 5. This was due to
activation of cryptic acceptor and donor splice sites. The added intron
sequence resulted in an alternative C-terminal 15 amino acids followed
by a stop codon.

Kollberg and Holme (2009) demonstrated that an antisense oligonucleotide
specifically targeting activated cryptic splice sites in the ISCU gene
induced by the 7044G-C mutation was able to restore the correct reading
frame in cultured fibroblasts derived from patients with homozygous
mutation. The restoration in cells was stable, with correctly spliced
mRNA remaining the dominant RNA species after 21 days.

Sanaker et al. (2010) reported a Norwegian woman with the disorder who
was homozygous for the 7044G-C mutation. Activities of mitochondrial
complexes I, II, and III were decreased in skeletal muscle samples,
whereas cultured myoblasts and fibroblasts had nearly normal activity.
Western blot analysis showed decreased ISCU type I in muscle, myoblasts,
and fibroblasts. The steady-state level of ISCU mRNA was significantly
decreased in patient myoblasts (20% of controls), moderately decreased
in muscle (54% of controls), and normal in fibroblasts. The mutant
transcript containing exons 5, 5A, and 6 was the predominant (90%)
species in patient muscle, although low levels (10%) of the normal
transcript with exons 5 and 6 were also found. Control samples had low
levels of the mutant transcript as well, suggesting that the mutation
strengthens a preexisting weak splice site. Patient blood, myoblasts,
and fibroblasts had equal amounts of both transcripts. Patient muscle
also specifically showed an increase in mitochondrial content compared
to controls, perhaps representing a compensatory mechanism. These
findings suggested that the ratio between normally spliced and
abnormally spliced transcript is important in determining tissue
specificity of the defect.

Nordin et al. (2011) demonstrated tissue-specific expression of the
mutant spliced ISCU protein. RT-PCR analysis of postmortem tissue
samples from a patient with the IVS5 mutation showed that the muscle had
the highest relative amount of mutant mRNA (80%), with the transcript
containing the 100-bp insert being the most common. In heart and liver,
the wildtype mRNA predominated, representing 70% total mRNA in heart and
54% in liver. The findings were confirmed by Western blot analysis of
the tissues. The results indicated that tissue-specific differential
splicing underlies the muscle-specific phenotype in patients with this
ISCU mutation.

Nordin et al. (2012) found that the RNA-binding factor IGF2BP1 (608288)
had a higher affinity for mutant ISCU than wildtype ISCU. PTBP1
(600693), implicated in repression of incorrect splicing, bound strongly
to both wildtype and mutant ISCU. In vitro studies using an ISCU
minigene showed that PTBP1 dramatically repressed incorrect splicing
when coexpressed with the mutant minigene, resulting in a 0.13-fold
change of the mutant:normal transcript ratio. In contrast, IGF2B1 and
RBM39 (604739) resulted in an increased mutant:normal transcript ratio
and were able to counteract the effect of PTBP1. Nordin et al. (2012)
suggested that IGF2BP1 in particular may be a factor that promotes the
inclusion of the pseudoexon in mutant ISCU by interfering with PTBP1
binding and repression of mutant ISCU.

.0002
MYOPATHY WITH LACTIC ACIDOSIS, HEREDITARY
ISCU, GLY50GLU

(255125), Kollberg et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for
the common intronic G-to-C mutation (611911.0001) and a 149G-A
transition in exon 3 of the ISCU gene, resulting in a gly50-to-glu
(G50E) substitution. The G50E mutation was inherited from their
unaffected Finnish mother and was not found in 100 Finnish controls.
Western blot analysis of skeletal muscle mitochondria showed only
slightly reduced levels of ISCU protein in the 2 brothers, suggesting
that the missense mutation gives rise to a nonfunctional protein. The
boys had a more severe phenotype than patients homozygous for the
intronic 7044G-C mutation. The brothers had progressive and severe
muscle weakness and muscle wasting beginning at age 2 years. They also
showed evidence of cardiac involvement, with EKG changes and mild
cardiac hypertrophy without dilatation. Kollberg et al. (2009) noted
that the boys did not complain of exercise intolerance, and suggested
that they were too weak to even elicit symptoms such as tachycardia,
palpitations, or shortness of breath.

607698	TITLE *607698 LIGAND-DEPENDENT NUCLEAR RECEPTOR COREPRESSOR; LCOR
;;MBLK1-RELATED PROTEIN 2; MLR2;;
KIAA1795
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LCOR is a transcriptional corepressor widely expressed in fetal and
adult tissues that is recruited to agonist-bound nuclear receptors
through a single LxxLL motif, also referred to as a nuclear receptor
(NR) box (Fernandes et al., 2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned LCOR, which they called KIAA1795.
The deduced KIAA1795 protein contains 572 amino acids. RT-PCR followed
by ELISA detected highest expression in liver, testis, and ovary,
followed by kidney and brain. Within brain, highest expression was
detected in amygdala, corpus callosum, and caudate nucleus.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a fetal kidney cDNA library using the
ligand-binding domain of ESR1 (133430) as bait, followed by screening a
prostate cDNA library and searching EST databases, Fernandes et al.
(2003) cloned LCOR. The predicted 433-amino acid LCOR protein has a
calculated molecular mass of approximately 47 kD. It contains an LxxLL
motif, a nuclear localization signal, and a helix-loop-helix domain.
Northern blot analysis detected broad expression of LCOR transcripts at
varying levels in human adult and fetal tissues, with highest expression
in placenta, cerebellum and corpus callosum of brain, adult kidney, and
a number of fetal tissues.

Kunieda et al. (2003) cloned mouse Lcor, which they called Mlr2, based
on its homology with the honeybee transcription factor Mblk1. The
deduced 433-amino acid protein contains a DNA-binding motif and a motif
conserved in Mlr1 (LCORL; 611799). Northern blot analysis detected
expression of Mlr2 in mouse kidney, liver, and heart, with weak
expression in brain and no expression in testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Fernandes et al. (2003) determined that binding of LCOR to ESR1 depends
in part on residues in the coactivator-binding pocket of ESR1 distinct
from those bound by TIF2 (601993). Repression by LCOR could be abolished
by histone deacetylase (HDAC; see 601241) inhibitor trichostatin A in a
receptor-dependent fashion, indicating HDAC-dependent and -independent
modes of action. LCOR bound directly to specific HDACs in vitro and in
vivo. Moreover, LCOR was shown to function by recruiting
C-terminal-binding protein (CTBP; see 602618) corepressors through 2
consensus binding motifs and to colocalize with CTBPs in the nucleus.
Fernandes et al. (2003) concluded that LCOR represents a class of
corepressor that attenuates agonist-activated nuclear receptor signaling
by multiple mechanisms.

Using a reporter gene assay, Kunieda et al. (2003) showed that mouse
Mlr2 bound and activated transcription from the DNA element recognized
by honeybee Mblk1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fernandes et al. (2003) determined that the LCOR gene contains 7 exons,
including 4 short 5-prime untranslated region exons that contain several
in-frame stop codons.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the LCOR gene to chromosome 10 by radiation
hybrid analysis. By genomic sequence analysis, Fernandes et al. (2003)
mapped the LCOR gene to chromosome 10q24.1.

148070	TITLE *148070 KERATIN 18; KRT18
;;K18;;
CYTOKERATIN 18; CYK18
DESCRIPTION Intermediate filaments (IFs) are a structurally related family of
cellular proteins that appear to be intimately involved with the
cytoskeleton. The common structural motif shared by all IFs is a central
alpha-helical 'rod domain' flanked by variable N- and C-terminal
domains. The rod domain, the canonical feature of IFs, has been highly
conserved during evolution. The variable terminals, however, have
allowed the known IFs to be classified into 6 distinct types by virtue
of their differing amino acid sequences (Steinert and Roop, 1988).
Keratins compose types I and II; intermediate filaments desmin,
vimentin, GFAP, and peripherin, type III; neurofilaments, type IV, and
nuclear lamins, type V. Nestin (600915) has been classed as type VI
(Lendahl et al., 1990). The acidic keratins are coded by genes KRT9
(607606) to KRT19 (148020). These genes are located on mouse chromosome
11 and human chromosome 17, except for KRT18 which may be located on
human chromosome 12 (see later). The basic keratins are coded by genes
KRT1 (139350) to KRT8 (148060), which are located on mouse chromosome 15
and human chromosome 12.

Human keratin 18 and the homologous mouse Endo B are type I IF protein
subunits whose expression is restricted in adults to a variety of simple
epithelial tissues. Endo B and its coexpressed type II keratin, Endo A
(the mouse equivalent of human keratin 8), appear to be the first IF
proteins expressed during murine development. Type I and type II
keratins are usually expressed as preferential pairs in equal
proportions in cells, although filaments can be formed in vitro from
heterologous IF subunits. KRT18 is the most divergent of the type I
keratins with N-terminal and C-terminal domains that are quite different
from those of epidermal keratins. According to Kulesh and Oshima (1989),
the genes that code for 12 diverse IF proteins had been cloned and
characterized. Kulesh and Oshima (1989) isolated the human KRT18 gene as
a 10-kb fragment of genomic DNA. Following transfection, the gene was
expressed in several different mouse cell lines including nonepithelial
cells that do not express the homologous endogenous Endo-B gene. The
KRT18 gene is 3,791 bp long and the keratin 18 protein is coded for by 7
exons. The exon structure of KRT18 has been conserved compared to that
of other keratin genes, with the exception of a single 3-prime terminal
exon that codes for the tail domain of the protein that is represented
by 2 exons in epidermal keratins. Waseem et al. (1990) used
human-specific primers from within introns of the published gene
sequence for human type I keratin 18 and PCR to amplify this gene
specifically. By Southern blotting using the genomic DNA PCR product,
they assigned the gene for keratin 18 to chromosome 12. Other human type
I keratins have been assigned to chromosome 17. Waseem et al. (1990)
suggested that the findings indicate the early divergence of the genes
for stratifying cell keratins from that of simple, or embryonic, keratin
18.

By in situ hybridization, Heath et al. (1990) localized a human
cytokeratin 18 cDNA sequence to 17p12-p11. They presented the findings
as evidence for a clustering of cytokeratin genes and related sequences
on the p and q arms of chromosome 17. The findings are, however,
inconsistent with those of Waseem et al. (1990).

By analysis of a YAC contig from 12q13, Yoon et al. (1994) demonstrated
that the KRT18 type I keratin gene is located next to its type II
partner, KRT8, in a cluster of type II keratin genes.

Ku et al. (1995) described transgenic mice that express point-mutant K18
and develop chronic hepatitis and hepatocyte fragility in association
with disruption of hepatocyte keratin filaments. They showed that
transgenic mice expressing mutant K18 are highly susceptible to
hepatotoxicity after acute administration of acetaminophen or chronic
ingestion of griseofulvin. The authors concluded that the predisposition
to hepatotoxicity results directly from the keratin mutation since
nontransgenic or transgenic mice that express normal human K18 are more
resistant. Hepatotoxicity was manifested by a significant difference in
lethality, liver histopathology, and biochemical serum testing. Keratin
glycosylation decreased in all griseofulvin-fed mice, whereas keratin
phosphorylation increased dramatically preferentially in mice expressing
normal K18. The phosphorylation increase in normal K18 after
griseofulvin feeding appeared to involve sites that are different from
those that increased after partial hepatectomy. Ku et al. (1996) stated
that this dramatic phosphorylation increase in nonmutant keratins could
provide survival advantage to hepatocytes. Although the potential for
K18 mutations to cause human disease remain to be investigated, they
considered it possible that K8/18 mutations may not directly cause
disease but may predispose to it; for example, mutations may confer
susceptibility to liver disease upon exposure to an environmental factor
such as a virus or hepatotoxin.

Although mutations had been described in 11 of the more than 20 keratin
intermediate filaments (as the basis of epidermal and oral disorders),
no disease-associated mutations had been described in keratin 8 (KRT8;
148060) or KRT18 until the report by Ku et al. (1997). K8/18 is the
major keratin pair in epithelia of the type found in liver, pancreas,
and intestine. Transgenic mice that express mutant keratin 18, as
already noted, develop chronic hepatitis, and have an increased
susceptibility to drug-induced hepatotoxicity. By studying patients with
liver disease of unknown cause for mutations in KRT18, Ku et al. (1997)
described a his127leu (H127L) KRT mutation in a patient with cryptogenic
cirrhosis (see 215600) that was germline transmitted (148070.0001). The
mutant KRT18 isolated from the liver explant, or after expression in
bacteria, showed an altered migration on 2-dimensional gel analysis as
compared with normal human liver or bacterially expressed KRT18.
Electron microscopy of in vitro assembled mutant KRT18 and wildtype KRT8
showed an assembly defect as compared with normal KRT8/18 assembly. The
results suggested that mutations in KRT18 predispose to cryptogenic
cirrhosis in humans.

Among 120 patients with cirrhosis of undetermined cause (see 215600), Ku
et al. (1997) found 1 patient with a heterozygous A-to-T transversion in
the KRT18 gene that resulted in a his127-to-leu substitution. The
mutation was germline since sequencing of amplified genomic DNA,
isolated from a blood sample of the daughter of the patient, showed the
same H127L mutation in heterozygous form.

Ku et al. (2003) found a his127-to-leu mutation in noncryptogenic
cirrhosis and concluded that the mutation functions as a susceptibility
gene.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ron and Habener (1992) cloned mouse Ddit3, which they called Chop.
Antisera raised against Chop recognized a nuclear protein with a
molecular mass of 29 kD.

Park et al. (1992) isolated the DDIT3 gene, which they called GADD153,
from human cells. The DDIT3 gene shows a high level of conservation in
both the structural and regulatory regions to the previously described
hamster gene. The human and hamster proteins share 91% amino acid
identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Ron and Habener (1992) showed that CHOP serves as a dominant-negative
inhibitor of the transcription factors C/EBP (116897, 116898) and LAP
(189965). They found that bacterially expressed CHOP inhibited the
DNA-binding activity of C/EBP and LAP by forming heterodimers that could
not bind DNA.

Using differential expression and immunohistochemical analyses of benign
nevi and melanomas of different levels, Korabiowska et al. (1997)
observed p53 (TP53; 191170) negativity and high expression of GADD34
(PPP1R15A; 611048), GADD45 (GADD45A; 126335), and GADD153 in all nevi.
However, in melanomas, p53 expression increased and GADD expression
decreased with the Clark level of melanoma thickness. Patient survival
time correlated negatively with p53 positivity and positively with
GADD45 and GADD153 expression. Korabiowska et al. (1997) concluded that
GADD proteins play an important role in the malignant transformation of
nevus to melanoma.

CHOP is activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress imposed by
unfolded and malfolded proteins. By transcriptional profiling, Marciniak
et al. (2004) compared gene expression in unstressed and ER-stressed
wildtype and Chop -/- primary mouse embryo fibroblasts. They found that
Chop directly activated Gadd34, which promoted ER protein biosynthesis
by dephosphorylating Eif2-alpha (EIF2S1; 603907) in stressed cells,
causing accumulation of high molecular mass protein complexes in the
stressed ER. Chop also activated Ero1-alpha (ERO1L; 615435), which
encodes an ER oxidase. Consequently, the ER of stressed Chop -/- cells
was hypooxidized relative to the ER of stressed wildtype cells.
Pharmacologic and genetic manipulations promoting a hypooxidized ER
reduced abnormal high molecular mass protein complexes and protected
cells from the lethal consequences of ER stress. Marciniak et al. (2004)
concluded that Chop deletion protected cells from ER stress by
decreasing ER protein load and changing redox conditions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Park et al. (1992) determined that the human and hamster DDIT3 genes
both contain 4 exons, with the intron/exon junctions maintained at
identical positions.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and in situ hybridization, Park et al.
(1992) mapped the DDIT3 gene to chromosome 12q13.1-q13.2.

CYTOGENETICS

CHOP is consistently rearranged in myxoid liposarcomas (613488) (Aman et
al., 1992). In the characteristic chromosomal translocation
t(12;16)(q13;p11), Crozat et al. (1993) showed that the CHOP gene is
fused with a gene on chromosome 16 provisionally designated TLS
(translocated in liposarcoma). The same gene was called FUS by Rabbitts
et al. (1993); see 137070. The TLS gene was found to be a novel nuclear
RNA-binding protein with extensive sequence similarity to EWS (133450),
the product of a gene commonly translocated in Ewing sarcoma (612219).
In TLS-CHOP, the RNA-binding domain of TLS is replaced by the
DNA-binding and leucine zipper dimerization domain of CHOP. Targeting of
a conserved effector domain of RNA-binding proteins to DNA may play a
role in tumor formation.

In an analysis of peripheral blood samples from 19 patients with myxoid
liposarcoma due to t(12;16) and in 1 patient with myxoid liposarcoma due
to t(12;22;20), resulting in the fusion of the CHOP and EWS genes,
Panagopoulos et al. (1996) found FUS/CHOP hybrid fragments in 3 patients
with t(12;16) and a EWS/CHOP hybrid in the patient with the latter
translocation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Endo et al. (2006) found that mice challenged intratracheally with
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) expressed Chop and Bip (HSPA5; 138120).
Compared with wildtype mice, mice lacking Chop showed reduced lung
inflammation in response to LPS, diminished Il1b (147720) activity, and
suppression of Casp11 (SFRS2IP; 603668) induction in bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid. Inflammation of lung in response to Il1b was not
attenuated in Chop-deficient mice. Endo et al. (2006) concluded that
CHOP is critical in LPS-induced lung injury and in induction of CASP11,
which mediates activation of pro-CASP1 (147678) and pro-IL1B.

CLONING

Liu et al. (2000) cloned mouse Scyl1, which they called p105, from an

a calculated molecular mass of about 89 kD. Scyl1 shares significant
sequence similarity with kinases, but its putative kinase domain lacks
subdomain 1 of the 12 characteristic subdomains, and it is missing
highly conserved residues in other subdomains, suggesting that Scyl1 is
not a functional kinase. Western blot analysis of mouse tissues found
that Scyl1 has an apparent molecular mass of about 105 kD and is present
in all tissues examined. Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions
indicated that mouse Scyl1 is primarily cytosolic and that it is present
in low density microsomes.

By large-scale sequencing of a mammary gland cDNA library, followed by
nested PCR and 5-prime RACE, Kato et al. (2002) cloned SCYL1, which they
called NTKL. The deduced 808-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 89.6 kD. Kato et al. (2002) also cloned 2 splice
variants that harbor internal deletions and encode proteins of 791 and
707 amino acids, which they termed variant 1 and variant 2,
respectively. NTKL has an N-terminal kinase-like domain and a C-terminal
cluster of basic amino acids. NTKL shares 90% amino acid identity with
mouse Ntkl, and like mouse Ntkl, it does not contain kinase subdomain 1.
NTKL also shares sequence similarity with the S. cerevisiae Scy1
protein. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.8-kb transcript in all
tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Using NTKL carrying 2 different epitope tags, Kato et al. (2002) found
that NTKL forms multimers following transfection into COS-7 cells. They
determined that NTKL forms a 300-kD trimer using crosslinking reagents.
Biochemical analysis revealed no phosphorylation or autophosphorylation
activity. Kato et al. (2002) found that the 707-amino acid NTKL variant,
variant 2, localized to centrosomes during mitosis. During interphase,
fluorescence-tagged variant 2 localized in the cytoplasm as well as
centrosomes. However, at the beginning of mitosis, the fluorescence
appeared as a pair of bright nuclear foci that followed centrosome
localization throughout mitosis, while maintaining diffuse cytoplasmic
labeling. Endogenous variant 2 in HeLa cells showed a similar staining
pattern. Centrosomal localization was independent of microtubules.

Di et al. (2003) identified an Ntkl-binding protein (GORAB; 607983) in
mouse that colocalized with Ntkl in cytoplasm and showed ubiquitous
expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kato et al. (2002) determined that the SCYL1 gene contains 18 exons and
spans about 15 kb. Alternative splicing produces variant 1, which lacks
half of exon 14, and variant 2, which lacks most of exon 14, all of exon
15, and half of exon 16.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Liu et al. (2000) and Kato et al. (2002)
mapped the SCYL1 gene to chromosome 11q13.

607758	TITLE *607758 CATENIN, BETA-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; CTNNBIP1
;;INHIBITOR OF BETA-CATENIN AND TCF4; ICAT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tago et al. (2000) cloned mouse Ctnnbip1, which they designated Icat.
Western blot analysis showed that the deduced 81-amino acid protein has
an apparent molecular mass of 9.0 kD. Tago et al. (2000) also identified
an EST clone for human ICAT. The deduced mouse and human proteins are
identical except for 2 amino acid changes. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected a 2.6-kb transcript expressed at high levels in
heart, brain, liver, and skeletal muscle, at low levels in kidney,
testis, and lung, and at undetectable levels in spleen. Icat was also
expressed at fairly constant levels during embryonic mouse development.

GENE FUNCTION

Tago et al. (2000) determined that mouse Icat interacts with
beta-catenin (116806) in vitro and in vivo. By mutation analysis, they
determined that the central region of Icat, specifically glu37, glu38,
and glu39, interacts with armadillo repeats 10 through 12 of
beta-catenin. Icat inhibited the interaction of beta-catenin with Tcf4
(TCF7L2; 602228) and repressed beta-catenin-Tcf4-mediated
transactivation. Icat inhibited Xenopus axis formation by interfering
with Wnt (see 164820) signaling. Tago et al. (2000) concluded that Icat
negatively regulates Wnt signaling via inhibition of the interaction
between beta-catenin and Tcf, and that Icat is required for development
and cell proliferation.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Graham et al. (2002) determined the crystal structure at 2.5-angstrom
resolution of a complex between CTNNB1 and ICAT, a protein that prevents
interaction between CTNNB1 and TCF/LEF family transcription factors.
ICAT contains a 3-helix bundle that binds armadillo repeats 10 to 12 and
a C-terminal tail that, like TCF and E-cadherin (192090), binds in the
groove formed by armadillo repeats 5 to 9 of CTNNB1. Graham et al.
(2002) showed that ICAT selectively inhibits CTNNB1/TCF binding in vivo,
without disrupting CTNNB1/cadherin interactions. They concluded that it
should be possible to design cancer therapeutics that inhibit
CTNNB1-mediated transcriptional activation without interfering with cell
adhesion.

Daniels and Weis (2002) determined the crystal structure of ICAT bound
to the armadillo repeat domain of CTNNB1. ICAT contains an N-terminal
helical domain that binds to repeats 11 and 12 of CTNNB1, and an
extended C-terminal region that binds to repeats 5 to 10 in a manner
similar to that of TCFs and other CTNNB1 ligands.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
CTNNBIP1 gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG2532).

604982	TITLE *604982 HPS1 GENE; HPS1
;;PALE EAR, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Oh et al. (1996) identified the HPS1 gene by positional cloning. The
HPS1 gene encodes a novel transmembrane protein that is thought to be a
component of multiple cytoplasmic organelles and is apparently crucial
for their normal development and function.

Wildenberg et al. (1998) demonstrated an apparent alternative transcript
of the HPS1 gene. By RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis, 2 polyadenylated
transcripts were found in normal human melanocytes, human bone marrow
cells, human melanoma cells, lymphoblastoid cell lines, and
megakaryocytic leukemia cells. Thus, the HPS1 gene is complex and may
have more than 1 biologically active transcript. Wildenberg et al.
(1998) noted that the same type of alternative splicing occurs in the
IGHM gene (147020), resulting in membrane-bound and secreted protein
products.

GENE FUNCTION

Martina et al. (2003) determined that HPS1 and HPS4 (606682) form a
lysosomal complex that they termed BLOC3 (biogenesis of lysosome-related
organelles complex-3). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated
that epitope-tagged and endogenous HPS1 and HPS4 proteins assembled with
each other in vivo. The complex was predominantly cytosolic, with a
small amount peripherally associated with membranes. Size exclusion
chromatography and sedimentation velocity analysis of the cytosolic
fraction indicated that HPS1 and HPS4 formed a moderately asymmetric
complex with a molecular mass of about 175 kD. Hps4-deficient
fibroblasts from light ear mice displayed normal distribution and
trafficking of a lysosomal protein and an apparently normal accumulation
of Zn(2+) in intracellular vesicles. In contrast, fibroblasts of AP3
(see AP3B1; 603401)-deficient pearl mice showed deficits in both of
these measures. Martina et al. (2003) concluded that HPS1 and HPS4 are
components of a cytosolic complex that is involved in the biogenesis of
lysosomal-related organelles through a mechanism distinct from that
operated by the AP3 complex.

MAPPING

Fukai et al. (1995) used the linkage disequilibrium mapping approach to
localize the HPS1 locus in 2 groups in whom the Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome (203300) is particularly frequent: a group in Puerto Rico and a
group in an isolated village in the Swiss Alps. They localized the HPS1
locus in both groups to a 0.6-cM interval in chromosome segment
10q23.1-q23.2. Wildenberg et al. (1995) likewise mapped the HPS1 locus
to 10q. They collected blood samples from a relatively homogeneous
population in Puerto Rico, where Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome has a
frequency of about 1 in 1,800, giving a carrier frequency estimated to
be 1 in 21. Analysis of pooled DNA samples allowed them to screen the
genome rapidly for candidate loci and identify linkage with a marker on
10q. The result was verified with additional markers, and a maximum lod
score of 5.07 at theta = 0.001 was calculated for marker D10S198.
Haplotype analysis placed the HPS1 locus in a region of approximately 1
cM that contains the markers D10S198 and D10S1239.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Oh et al. (1996) identified homozygous frameshifts in the HPS1 gene in
Puerto Rican, Swiss, Irish, and Japanese HPS patients.

Oh et al. (1998) performed mutation analysis on 44 unrelated Puerto
Rican and 24 unrelated non-Puerto Rican HPS patients. A 16-bp frameshift
duplication (604982.0001), the result of an apparent founder effect, was
nearly ubiquitous among Puerto Rican patients. A frameshift at codon 322
may be the most frequent HPS mutation in Europeans. The mutation in
these cases was a 1-bp insertion (or duplication) in a poly(C) tract at
codons 322 to 324. Oh et al. (1998) also described 6 novel HPS1
mutations: a 5-prime splice-junction mutation of IVS5, 3 frameshifts, a
nonsense mutation, and a 1-codon in-frame deletion. These mutations
defined an apparent frameshift hotspot at codons 321-322. Overall,
however, they detected mutations in the HPS1 gene in only about half of
non-Puerto Rican patients, and presented evidence suggesting locus
heterogeneity for HPS.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

The different clinical HPS phenotypes associated with different HPS1
frameshifts suggested to Oh et al. (1996) that differentially truncated
HPS1 polypeptides may have somewhat different consequences for
subcellular function.

ANIMAL MODEL

Two genetically distinct mouse loci, 'pale ear' (ep) and 'ruby-eye'
(ru), both with mutant phenotypes similar to human Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome, map close together in the homologous region of murine
chromosome 19, which suggested that one of these loci might be
homologous to human HPS. Feng et al. (1997) characterized the mouse Hps
cDNA and genomic locus, and identified pathologic Hps gene mutations in
ep but not in ru mice, establishing mouse 'pale ear' as an animal model
for human Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. The phenotype of homozygous ep
mutant mice encompasses those of both Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and
Chediak-Higashi syndrome, suggesting that these disorders may be closely
related. In addition, the mouse and human HPS genes both contain a rare
'AT-AC' intron (i.e., an intron with nonconsensus splice sites), and
comparison of the sequences of this intron in the mouse and human genes
identified conserved sequences that suggest a possible role for pre-mRNA
secondary structure in excision of this rare class of introns. (See
601428 and 601429 for a discussion of small nuclear RNAs necessary for
AT-AC intron splicing, and see Hall and Padgett (1994) for a discussion
of introns with nonconsensus splice sites.)

To test for in vivo interactions between the HPS1 and HPS2 genes in the
production and function of intracellular organelles, Feng et al. (2002)
created mice doubly heterozygous for the 2 mutant genes by appropriate
breeding. Cooperation between the 2 genes in melanosome production was
evident in increased hypopigmentation of the coat together with dramatic
quantitative and qualitative alterations of melanosomes of the retinal
pigment epithelium and choroid of double-mutant mice. Lysosomal and
platelet dense granule abnormalities, including hyposecretion of
lysosomal enzymes from kidneys and depression of serotonin
concentrations of platelet dense granules were likewise more severe in
double than in single mutants. Also, lysosomal enzyme concentrations
were significantly increased in lungs of double-mutant mice. Interaction
between the 2 genes was specific in that effects on organelles were
confined to melanosomes, lysosomes, and platelet dense granules.
Together, the evidence indicated that these 2 HPS genes function largely
independently at the whole-organism level to affect the production and
function of all 3 organelles. Furthermore, the increased lysosomal
enzyme levels in lung of double-mutant mice suggested a cause of a major
clinical problem of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, lung fibrosis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, 16-BP DUP

By SSCP/heteroduplex analysis and DNA sequencing, Oh et al. (1996) found
that 22 Puerto Rican patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (203300)
were homozygous for a 16-bp duplication within exon 15 of the HPS gene,
resulting in a frameshift distal to codon pro496, with termination of
the nonsense polypeptide at codon 586. Similarly, all 11 obligate
heterozygotes tested were heterozygous, whereas they did not observe
this mutation in 5 Puerto Rican or 15 Asian controls, or in 11
non-Puerto Rican Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome patients. Although
Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome is frequent on the island of Puerto Rico, it
has not been reported elsewhere in the Caribbean. Apparent homogeneity
of the 16-bp frameshift duplication among Puerto Rican Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome patients suggests that this mutation arose in Puerto Rico
during its early population or colonization and that the frequency of
the mutation was amplified as a founder effect due to occult inbreeding
and genetic drift. The mutation was easily identified, even by simple
agarose electrophoresis of the exon 15 PCR product, which appears
abnormally large; furthermore, heterozygotes additionally exhibit a
prominent aberrant heteroduplex band. Thus, diagnosis, prenatal
diagnosis, and carrier testing for Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome in the
Puerto Rican population, in which the expected frequency of heterozygote
may be as high as 1 in 21 persons, is possible.

All identified patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome in northwest
Puerto Rico were found to be homozygous for the 16-bp duplication in
exon 15 of the HPS gene. Gahl et al. (1998) compared the clinical and
laboratory characteristics of these patients with those of patients
without the 16-bp duplication. They studied 49 patients: 27 Puerto
Ricans and 22 patients from mainland United States who were not of
Puerto Rican descent. The diagnosis was based on the presence of
albinism and the absence of platelet dense bodies. Homozygosity for the
16-bp duplication was found in 25 of the 27 Puerto Rican patients,
whereas none of the non-Puerto Rican patients carried this mutation.
Like the patients without the duplication, the patients with the 16-bp
duplication had a broad variation in pigmentation. Nine of 16 adults
with the duplication, but none of the 10 without it, had a diffusing
capacity for carbon monoxide that was less than 80% of the predicted
value. High-resolution computed tomography in all 12 patients with the
16-bp duplication revealed minimal fibrosis in 8, moderate fibrosis in
1, severe fibrosis in 1, and no fibrosis in 2. Computed tomography in 8
patients without the duplication revealed minimal fibrosis in 3 and no
fibrosis in the rest. Inflammatory bowel disease developed in 8 patients
(4 in each group) between 3 and 25 years of age. Thus, the 16-bp
duplication in exon 15 of the HPS gene, which had been found only in
Puerto Rican patients, is associated with a broad range of pigmentation
and an increased risk of restrictive lung disease in adults.

.0002
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, 1-BP INS, 322C

In the inbred Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (203300) kindred studied by
Schallreuter et al. (1993), Oh et al. (1996) identified homozygosity for
a frameshift at codon pro324, due to an additional cytosine in a run of
8 cytosines, in the HPS gene. This same mutation (T322insC) was found in
an unrelated Irish-German patient (Oh et al., 1998). The 2 patients were
divergent for intragenic polymorphisms that flank this mutation; the
findings suggested that this frameshift arose independently in the 2
populations. A third patient was homozygous for the frameshift mutation
and for the polymorphic haplotype found in the patient of Irish-German
origin. Patient 4 was a compound heterozygote for the Swiss type
mutation but associated, however, with the Irish-German haplotype; the
other allele in this patient had a novel nonsense mutation, glu666 to
ter (604982.0003).

.0003
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, GLU666TER

In a non-Puerto Rican case of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (203300), Oh et
al. (1998) found compound heterozygosity for the T322insC frameshift
mutation (604982.0002) and a novel nonsense mutation, glu666 to ter
(E666X).

.0004
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, 1-BP DEL, 322C

Oh et al. (1998) described a Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (203300) patient
who was homozygous for a novel frameshift mutation in the HPS gene,
T322delC, that involved the same poly(C) tract involved in the T322insC
frameshift (604982.0002).

.0005
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, GLU133TER

Shotelersuk et al. (1998) studied 18 non-Puerto Rican Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome (203300) families and identified HPS mutations in 3 of them. In
1 patient, one of the newly identified mutations, E133X, was present in
compound state with a previously described mutation, T322insC
(604982.0002). The patient was a 6-year-old girl of Italian, German, and
Ukrainian ancestry. Born with pale skin, she was noted to have nystagmus
at 2 months of age and pale retinas at 3 months of age, when
oculocutaneous albinism was diagnosed. Bruising began at 7 to 8 months
of age, and Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome was diagnosed at 18 months of age
based on abnormal platelet aggregation studies. Epistaxis occurred in
the winter months and prolonged bleeding accompanied a cut lip and
placement of myringotomy tubes. Asthma was diagnosed at 1 year of age.
There were no signs of colitis or pulmonary fibrosis.

.0006
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, 1-BP INS, 962G

Horikawa et al. (2000) reported a Japanese man with Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome (203300), who had oculocutaneous albinism and a bleeding
diathesis. The patient was a compound heterozygote for 2 HPS1 mutations:
a frameshift mutation (962-963insG) at codon 321 in exon 11; and a
5-prime splice-junction mutation (IVS5+5G-A). The content of eumelanin
in the patient's hairs was significantly reduced. Histologic analysis
using light and electron microscopy revealed that melanocytes in the
patient's epidermis contained giant melanosomes.

613632	TITLE *613632 WAS PROTEIN FAMILY HOMOLOG 1; WASH1
;;WASH
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Linardopoulou et al. (2007) cloned WASH1, which they called WASH. The
deduced protein contains 468 amino acids. WASH has 2 WASH homology
domains (WHD1 and WHD2) in its N-terminal half. In its C-terminal half,
WASH has a proline-rich stretch followed by a WH2 actin (see
102560)-binding domain (V), a central region (C), and an acidic stretch
(A) that together form the VCA module found in all WASP proteins (see
WASF1; 605035). The VCA module mediates binding to actin and the ARP2/3
protein complex (604221) and stimulates actin nucleation. Northern blot
analysis detected an approximately 1.8-kb transcript in all tissues
examined. RNA dot blot analysis and RT-PCR confirmed ubiquitous and
variable WASH1 expression. Database analysis revealed WASH orthologs in
both vertebrates and invertebrates. Vertebrates showed highest
conservation in the WASH C terminus. Fluorescence-tagged WASH1
colocalized with cytoskeletal actin and accumulated in filopodia and
lamellipodia.

Using Western blot analysis of Jurkat human T cells, Gomez and Billadeau
(2009) detected WASH at an apparent molecular mass of 70 kD. HeLa cells
expressed a WASH isoform lacking the N-terminal region.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a punctate cytoplasmic WASH
distribution in Jurkat, HeLa, and U-87MG glioblastoma cell lines.

- Copy Number Variation

Linardopoulou et al. (2007) identified numerous subtelomeric copies of
the WASH gene distributed among multiple human chromosomes. FISH
analysis revealed variation in their copy number and location among
primate species and human individuals. Sequencing of long-range PCR
products from 3 unrelated individuals revealed up to 5 potentially
functional WASH variants and multiple pseudogenes per individual human
genome.

GENE FUNCTION

Linardopoulou et al. (2007) found that the isolated VCA module of
recombinant human WASH1 stimulated in vitro actin polymerization in the
presence of the ARP2/3 complex.

Gomez and Billadeau (2009) found that WASH was required for retrograde
transport of cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (IGF2R;
147280) via the retromer complex (see 601272). WASH functioned in a
multiprotein complex of over 600 kD that also contained FAM21 (see
FAM21C; 613631) and APR2/3. Mutation analysis revealed that the N
terminus of WASH interacted with FAM21, the WHD2 domain interacted with
alpha-tubulin (see 602529), and the VCA region interacted with actin.
WASH interaction with FAM21 was required for its endosomal localization.
Knockdown of WASH blocked retromer-mediated endosome sorting.

GENE STRUCTURE

Linardopoulou et al. (2007) determined that the WASH1 gene contains 11
exons and spans 15 kb. The first exon is noncoding and lies within a CpG
island.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Linardopoulou et al. (2007) mapped the
WASH1 gene to the subtelomeric region of chromosome 9p, where it ends
within 5 kb of the telomere array. Linardopoulou et al. (2007)
identified WASH pseudogenes on similar subtelomeric regions of
chromosomes 15q, 1p, Xq/Yq, and 16p. The single-copy mouse Wash ortholog
maps to an internal location on chromosome 17.

ANIMAL MODEL

Linardopoulou et al. (2007) found that knockout of the Drosophila WASH
ortholog, which they called washout, was early embryonic lethal.

182465	TITLE *182465 SON DNA-BINDING PROTEIN; SON
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SON is a nuclear speckle-localized protein that shares homology with
pre-mRNA splicing accessory factors (Wynn et al., 2000).

CLONING

Berdichevskii et al. (1988) cloned a fragment designated Son3 from a
human embryonic cDNA bank. The nucleotide sequence was found to be 1,454
bp long with 6 possible open reading frames, only 1 of which did not
contain terminating codons. Translation of that open reading frame into
an amino acid sequence and database analysis showed that the Son3 region
codes for a protein with the following distinctive features: (1) the
presence of a cluster of short tandem repeats from 7 to 19 amino acids
long, located in the central part of the sequence; (2) the presence of
lengthy regions of homology with certain DNA-binding structural
proteins, such as gallin (55%), and also with oncoproteins encoded by
protooncogenes of the MYC family; and (3) the presence of a region of
homology with an oncoprotein encoded by the MOS protooncogene (190060).

Wynn et al. (2000) independently identified human SON, which shares
84.2% amino acid identity with its mouse homolog. SON has a basic
serine/arginine-rich C-terminal domain that shares homology with
proteins involved in mRNA processing. Immunofluorescence studies
localized endogenous SON to interchromatin granules of the interphase
nucleus in human epithelial cells. The nuclear speckled staining pattern
was similar to that observed with mRNA splicing factors, suggesting that
SON may play a role in mRNA processing.

GENE FUNCTION

From a human keratinocyte cDNA library, Khan et al. (1994) isolated a
clone for the DNA-binding protein SON. Using this clone, they found that
the SON gene is expressed in various cell types and that homologous
sequences can be detected in vertebrate and insect genomic DNA.

Using a combination of proteomics, cytology, and functional analysis in
C. elegans, Chu et al. (2006) reduced 1,099 proteins copurified with
spermatogenic chromatin to 132 proteins for functional analysis. This
strategy to find fertility factors conserved from C. elegans to mammals
achieved its goal: of mouse gene knockouts corresponding to nematode
proteins, 37% (7 of 19) cause male sterility. This list includes PPP1CC
(176914), H2AX (601772), SON, TOP1 (126420), DDX4 (605281), DBY
(400010), and CENPC (117141).

Karlas et al. (2010) reported the discovery of 287 human host cell genes
influencing influenza A virus replication, including SON, in a
genomewide RNA interference screen. Using an independent assay, Karlas
et al. (2010) confirmed 168 hits (59%) inhibiting either the endemic
HIN1 (119 hits) or the pandemic swine-origin (121 hits) influenza A
virus strains, with an overlap of 60%. SON was found to be important for
normal trafficking of influenza virions to late endosomes early in
infection.

GENE STRUCTURE

Slavov et al. (2000) predicted that the SON gene contains 10 exons
spanning 25 kb. Wynn et al. (2000) determined that the SON gene contains
12 exons.

MAPPING

Using PCR to amplify SON sequences from a panel of somatic cell hybrids,
Khan et al. (1994) assigned the human SON gene to chromosome 21. By use
of hybrids containing regions of chromosome 21, the localization was
refined to 21q22.1-q22.2.

Wynn et al. (2000) determined that both human and mouse SON and DONSON
(611428) are in tail-to-tail orientation and in the following order:
GART (138440)-SON-DONSON.
