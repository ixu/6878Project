;;SORORIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential expression analysis for genes coexpressed with cell
cycle genes (e.g., CDC2; 116940), Walker (2001) identified CDCA5.

Rankin et al. (2005) identified Xenopus Cdca5, which they called p35, by
a proteomic screen for anaphase-promoting complex (APC) substrates. By
searching databases for sequences similar to Xenopus p35, they
identified human and mouse CDCA5. The deduced human and mouse proteins
contain 252 and 264 amino acids, respectively. Both contain a KEN box
for APC-dependent ubiquitination. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed a
punctate nuclear distribution of CDCA5 during interphase and a diffuse
distribution of CDCA5 throughout the cell during mitosis. There was no
apparent concentration of CDCA5 on chromatin in mitotic cells. The level
of CDCA5 dropped in synchronized HeLa cells during interphase.

Nishiyama et al. (2010) found that epitope-tagged mouse sororin
accumulated on chromatin in transfected HeLa cells between early S and
G2 phases and became dispersed in the cytoplasm following nuclear
envelope breakdown. It was also enriched at centromeres in prometaphase
and metaphase.

GENE FUNCTION

Rankin et al. (2005) found that overexpression of CDCA5 in Xenopus
embryos caused failure to resolve and segregate sister chromatids in
mitosis and increased the amount of cohesin associated with metaphase
chromosomes. In cultured human and mouse cells, depletion of CDCA5
caused mitotic arrest and the complete failure of sister chromatid
cohesion. Rankin et al. (2005) hypothesized that CDCA5 regulates the
ability of the cohesin complex to mediate sister chromatid cohesion.
They proposed calling the CDCA5 protein sororin, from the Latin word
soror, meaning sister, because of its role in sister chromatid cohesion.

Using RNA interference, Nishiyama et al. (2010) found that knockdown of
sororin in HeLa cells caused failure of chromosome congression,
consistent with a cohesion defect prior to metaphase. Depletion of Scc1
(RAD21; 606462) or Sgo1 (SGOL1; 609168) in Xenopus oocytes reduced
chromosomal sororin staining, suggesting that association of sororin
with mitotic chromosomes depends upon cohesin. Geminin (GMNN; 602842), a
protein that inhibits cohesin loading onto DNA, abolished association of
sororin with chromatin. Inhibition of DNA replication in HeLa cells also
reduced sororin levels on chromatin. Knockdown studies revealed that
sororin was only required for chromosome cohesion in the presence of
WAPL (WAPAL; 610754), which functions to destabilize chromosome
cohesion. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that sororin interacted
with the WAPL-binding protein PDS5 (see PDS5A; 613200) and displaced
WAPL from its interaction with PDS5. Nishiyama et al. (2010) concluded
that sororin maintains sister chromatid cohesion by inhibiting
WAPL-induced dissociation of cohesin from DNA.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the CDCA5 gene to chromosome 11q13.1 based on an
alignment of the CDCA5 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC011000) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

601437	TITLE *601437 Fc FRAGMENT OF IgG, RECEPTOR TRANSPORTER, ALPHA; FCGRT
;;IMMUNOGLOBULIN RECEPTOR, INTESTINAL, HEAVY CHAIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The intestinal epithelium of neonatal mice and rats expresses an Fc
receptor (FcRn) that mediates the selective uptake of immunoglobulin G
(IgG) in mothers' milk, thereby helping newborn animals to acquire
passive immunity. Kandil et al. (1996) noted that the IgG in the milk is
bound to FcRn at the apical surface of the intestinal epithelium, and
the resultant FcRn-IgG complexes are transcytosed across the epithelium.
At the basolateral surface of intestinal epithelial cells, IgG is
released from FcRn into blood or tissue fluids. FcRn is structurally
similar to the major histocompatibility complex class I molecule, which
presents antigenic peptides to T cells. Like the MHC class I molecule,
FcRn is made up of a heavy chain (approximately 48 kD) and
beta-2-microglobulin (109700; approximately 12 kD). Its heavy chain
shows approximately 35% amino acid sequence identity to that of a
typical MHC class I molecule. Furthermore, the genomic organizations of
the MHC class I and mouse FcRn heavy chain genes are similar in that the
signal peptide, the 3 extracellular domains, the transmembrane region,
and the cytoplasmic region are all encoded by separate exons. Story et
al. (1994) cloned a cDNA encoding the human gene and symbolized it FcRn.
Kandil et al. (1996) isolated human genomic clones for the gene
(symbolized FCGRT by them) using 2 murine Fcgrt probes. The exonic
sequences of the genomic clones are identical to the cDNA sequence
described by Story et al. (1994).

GENE FUNCTION

Plasma protein catabolism occurs in vascular endothelium by endocytotic
processing of plasma contents. Vascular endothelium is the most active
endocytic tissue in the body and the principal site for plasma protein
catabolism. Plasma proteins diffusing or transported into extravascular
sites are isolated from catabolism while extravascular. The receptor
encoded by the FCGRT gene, alternatively called the Brambell receptor,
the protection receptor, or the neonatal receptor, is located in
endosomes of vascular endothelial cells and selectively recycles IgG to
the cell surface, thus protecting IgG from lysosomal catabolism that is
the fate of other, nonprotected plasma proteins. In mice with knockout
of this receptor, the fractional catabolic rate for IgG may be
accelerated up to 10-fold relative to wildtype animals in which
protection is intact (Junghans and Anderson, 1996). This protection
mechanism is directly responsible for making IgG the longest lived of
all plasma proteins (Waldmann and Strober, 1969).

Junghans et al. (2001) postulated that long-range cis inactivation of
the FCGRT gene is responsible for hypercatabolism of IgG in myotonic
dystrophy (DM; 160900). The FCGRT gene is closely situated to the DMPK
gene (605377), which is mutant in DM.

MAPPING

Ahouse et al. (1993) found that the mouse FcRn heavy chain gene,
designated Fcgrt, maps to chromosome 7 and thus is not encoded by the
MHC. Kandil et al. (1996) showed by fluorescence in situ hybridization
that the human gene, FCGRT, maps to 19q13.3. Thus, like its mouse
counterpart, FCGRT is not encoded by the MHC.

ANIMAL MODEL

Akilesh et al. (2004) showed that mice lacking FcRn were resistant to
transient inflammatory arthritis induced in wildtype mice upon transfer
of serum from arthritic K/BxN mice, which are universally susceptible to
autoimmune arthritis due to pathogenic anti-GPI (172400) IgG antibodies.
K/BxN mice deficient in FcRn had significantly delayed onset of
arthritis or only intermittent ankle inflammation without arthritic
disease, and they had low anti-GPI antibody titers without high B-cell
levels in popliteal lymph nodes during the experimental period.
Heterozygote and sick homozygote mice had lymphocytes expressing the
B-cell maturation markes Prdm1 (603423) and Tnfrsf17 (109545), the Th2
cytokines IL1b (147720) and IL10 (124092), the chemokines Scya20 (CCL20;
601960) and Scya3 (CCL3; 182283), and Fcgr1 (146760). Treatment of mice
with high-dose intravenous Ig (IVIg) reduced or eliminated arthritis
dependent on the presence of Fcgr2 (146790) and/or FcRn. Akilesh et al.
(2004) concluded that these findings provide a rational basis for the
use of IVIg and suggested that FcRn is a potential therapeutic target
linking the initiation and effector phases of humoral autoimmune
disease.

In contrast to rodents, in humans FcRn is expressed in adults, in
placenta--where it serves to transport IgG from mother to fetus (Story
et al., 1994)--and in several absorptive epithelial tissues, including
the lung, kidney, and intestine. The expression of FcRn in absorptive
epithelia, coupled with the description by Dickinson et al. (1999) of
FcRn transport of IgG through human intestinal epithelial cells in
vitro, suggested to Bitonti et al. (2004) that FcRn might be exploited
for the delivery of therapeutic proteins by conjugation of the proteins
to an FcRn-binding ligand, such as the Fc fragment of IgG1, which would
allow their transport across the epithelium. Bitonti et al. (2004)
showed that FcRn-mediated transport is functional in the lung of
nonhuman primates and that this transport system can be used to deliver
erythropoietin (EPO; 133170) when it is conjugated to the Fc region of
IgG1. Erythropoietin is a hormone used to stimulate red blood cell
production but requiring chronic therapy with either intravenous or
subcutaneous injection, making an alternative noninvasive method of
delivery desirable. FcRn-dependent absorption was more efficient when
the EPO-Fc fusion protein was deposited predominantly in the upper and
central airways of the lung, where epithelial expression FcRn was most
prominently detected. The bioavailability of an EPO-Fc monomer when
delivered through the lung was approximately equal to that reported for
unconjugated EPO delivered subcutaneously in humans. These studies
showed that FcRn can be harnessed to noninvasively deliver bioactive
proteins into the systemic circulation in therapeutic quantities.

186973	TITLE *186973 IL2-INDUCIBLE T-CELL KINASE; ITK
;;TYROSINE KINASE EXPRESSED MAINLY IN T CELLS; EMT;;
T-CELL ITK/TSK TYROSINE KINASE, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ITK gene encodes IL2 (147680)-inducible T-cell kinase, which is
important for proper T-cell development, T-cell receptor (TCR)
signaling, cytokine release, and regulation of differentiation. ITK is
analogous to Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK; 300300), which is specifically
expressed in B cells and instrumental for their undisturbed development,
differentiation, and signaling (summary by Linka et al., 2012).

CLONING

Signal transduction through the T-cell receptor (TCR; see 186880) and
cytokine receptors on the surface of T lymphocytes occurs largely via
tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrates. Signal
transduction is thought to occur via association of these receptors with
intracellular protein tyrosine kinases. To identify unique T-cell
tyrosine kinases, Gibson et al. (1993) used PCR-based cloning with
degenerate oligonucleotides directed at highly conserved motifs of
tyrosine kinase domains. In this way, they cloned the complete cDNA for
a unique human tyrosine kinase that is expressed mainly in T lymphocytes
and natural killer (NK) cells. The cDNA predicted an open reading frame
of 1,866 bp encoding a protein with a predicted size of 72 kD, which was
in keeping with its size on Western blotting. A single 6.2-kb mRNA and
72-kD protein were detected in T lymphocytes and NK-like cell lines, but
were not detected in other cell lineages. Sequence comparisons suggested
that the protein is probably the human homolog of a murine
interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK). However, unlike ITK, the
message and protein levels for the new entity did not vary markedly on
stimulation of human IL-2 responsive T cells with IL-2. They referred to
the gene and its protein product as EMT ('expressed mainly in T cells').
They concluded that EMT is a member of a new family of intracellular
kinases that includes BPK (the kinase mutant in X-linked
agammaglobulinemia, 300300). The expression of EMT message and protein
in thymocytes and mature T cells, combined with its homology to BPK and
its chromosomal localization, suggested that EMT may play a role in
thymic ontogeny and growth regulation of mature T cells.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

ITK is the T-cell-specific homolog of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK),
which is mutant in X-linked agammaglobulinemia (300300). Cheng et al.
(1994) showed that BTK interacts with 3 protein-tyrosine kinases that
get activated upon stimulation of B- and T-cell receptors. These
interactions are mediated by two 10-amino acid motifs in BTK; an
analogous site with the same specificity is also present in ITK.

GENE FUNCTION

Integrin adhesion receptors mediate critical interactions of T cells
with other cells and extracellular matrix components during trafficking,
as well as during antigen-specific recognition events in tissue.
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K; see 601232) has a role in the
regulation of integrin activity by CD3 (see 186790)-TCR and in the
regulation of ITK. Woods et al. (2001) determined that TCR-mediated
activation of beta-1 integrins (see ITGB1; 135630) requires activation
of ITK and PI3K-dependent recruitment of ITK to detergent-insoluble
glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (DIGs) via binding of the
pleckstrin homology domain of ITK to the PI3K product PI(3,4,5)-P3.
Likewise, activation of PI3K and LCK (153390) via CD4 (186940)
coreceptor stimulation can initiate beta-1 integrin activation dependent
on ITK function. CD4 stimulation, together with targeting of ITK to
DIGs, also activates TCR-independent beta-1 integrin function. Changes
in beta-1 integrin function mediated by TCR-induced activation of ITK
are accompanied by ITK-dependent modulation of the actin cytoskeleton.
Woods et al. (2001) concluded that TCR-mediated activation of beta-1
integrin involves membrane relocalization and activation of ITK via
coordinate action of PI3K and an SRC family tyrosine kinase.

Hwang et al. (2005) reported that TBET (604895) represses Th2 lineage
commitment through tyrosine kinase-mediated interaction between itself
and GATA3 (131320) that interferes with the binding of GATA3 to its
target DNA. Hwang et al. (2005) concluded that their results provide a
novel function for tyrosine phosphorylation of a transcription factor in
specifying alternate fates of a common progenitor cell. Hwang et al.
(2005) showed that TBET phosphorylation is restricted to the TEC kinases
ITK and RLK (600058). Coexpression studies demonstrated that this was
most efficiently performed by ITK. In primary CD4 T cells isolated from
ITK-, RLK-, or double ITK/RLK-deficient mice, the greatest diminution of
TBET tyrosine phosphorylation was seen in the absence of ITK.
Furthermore, mutation of TBET at tyrosine residue 525, but not control
tyrosine residue 437, resulted in greatly reduced phosphorylation by
ITK, revealing that ITK phosphorylates TBET at residue Y525 after T cell
receptor stimulation.

Huang et al. (2007) showed that phosphorylation of inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) into IP4 promoted pleckstrin homology domain
binding to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and was required for
full activation of Itk in primary mouse thymocytes. They proposed that
IP4 establishes a feedback loop of phospholipase C-gamma-1 (PLCG1;
172420) activation through ITK that is essential for T-cell development.

MAPPING

Gibson et al. (1993) mapped the EMT gene to chromosome 5q31-q32 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Janis et al. (1994) mapped the human ITK gene to
5q32-q33. By Southern blot analysis of DNA from the progeny of 2
multilocus crosses, the murine Itk gene was mapped to chromosome 11 in a
region of homology to human 5q. The region in humans is frequently
deleted in the myelodysplastic syndrome.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 sisters with autosomal recessive fatal EBV-associated
lymphoproliferative syndrome-1 (LPFS1; 613011), Huck et al. (2009)
identified a homozygous mutation in the ITK gene (R355W; 186973).

In 3 members of a consanguineous Arab family with lymphoproliferative
syndrome-1, Stepensky et al. (2011) identified a homozygous truncating
mutation in the ITK gene (Y588X; 186973.0002). The mutation, which was
found by homozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene sequencing,
segregated with the disorder in the family.

In a patient, born of consanguineous Moroccan parents, with
lymphoproliferative syndrome-1, Linka et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous missense mutation in the ITK gene (R29H; 186973.0003). Linka
et al. (2012) performed functional studies on cells from the patients
reported by Huck et al. (2009), Stepensky et al. (2011), and Linka et
al. (2012), and found that all had a reduced calcium signaling response
after TCR stimulation and were unable to enhance calcium response in
Itk-null mouse cells, consistent with a loss of function. In vitro
studies showed that all mutant proteins had reduced half-lives; the R29H
mutation impeded membrane targeting of ITK.

ANIMAL MODEL

By homologous recombination, Schaeffer et al. (1999) disrupted the Rlk
(TXK; 600058) gene in mice. Heterozygotes were completely normal.
Homozygous null Rlk mice showed increased amounts of Itk mRNA. The
authors hypothesized that upregulation of related Tec kinases may
partially compensate for the lack of Rlk. Schaeffer et al. (1999)
therefore generated Rlk -/- Itk -/- mice by interbreeding. Itk-deficient
mice have reduced numbers of mature T cells, particularly CD4+ cells,
causing a decreased CD4-to-CD8 ratio. Rlk -/- Itk -/- mutants, however,
had normal T cell numbers. Both CD4+ and CD8+ cell numbers are increased
relative to Itk -/- mice. The persistent abnormal ratio of CD4+ to CD8+
cells suggested an altered regulation of lymphoid development and
homeostasis in the double mutants. The double mutants had marked defects
in T-cell receptor responses including proliferation, cytokine
production, and apoptosis in vitro and adaptive immune responses to
Toxoplasma gondii in vivo. Molecular events immediately downstream from
the T-cell receptor were intact in Rlk -/- Itk -/- cells, but
intermediate events including inositol trisphosphate production, calcium
mobilization, and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation were
impaired, establishing Tec kinases as critical regulators of T-cell
receptor signaling required for phospholipase C-gamma activation.

Using flow cytometry, Dubois et al. (2006) found that Il15 (600554) -/-
mice lacked Cd44 (107269)-hi/Cd122 (IL2RB; 146710)-hi memory phenotype
Cd8-positive T cells in both the periphery and thymus, whereas Itk -/-
mice lacked Cd44-lo/Cd122-lo naive Cd8-positive T cells in the periphery
and thymus. Mice lacking both Itk and Il15 had a severe reduction of all
CD8-positive T cells. Dubois et al. (2006) proposed that there are 2
distinct populations of CD8-positive T cells dependent on ITK or IL15,
and that the IL15-dependent CD44-hi/CD122-hi memory phenotype
CD8-positive T cells have functions in both innate and adaptive
immunity.

Broussard et al. (2006) found that Cd8-positive T cells from mice
lacking Itk or both Itk and Rlk expressed memory markers (e.g., Cd44 and
Cd122) and rapidly produced Ifng (147570). Itk deficiency greatly
increased the number of cells selected by MHC class Ib. Broussard et al.
(2006) concluded that the absence of TEC kinases prevents conventional
CD8-positive T-cell development and leads to generation of a large
population of nonconventional innate-type CD8-positive T cells. Atherly
et al. (2006) presented similar findings.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE SYNDROME 1
ITK, ARG335TRP

In 2 Turkish sisters, born of consanguineous parents, with fatal
EBV-associated lymphoproliferative syndrome-1 (LPFS1; 613011), Huck et
al. (2009) identified a homozygous 1085C-T transition in exon 11 of the
ITK gene, resulting in an arg335-to-trp (R335W) substitution in a highly
conserved residue in the BG loop of the SH2 domain. Attempts to
functionally express the R335W mutant in bacteria failed due to
aggregation of the recombinant protein, whereas wildtype protein was
stable and expressed functionally at high levels. Functional expression
in 293T cells showed mRNA expression of the mutant transcript, but
nearly undetectable ITK protein, consistent with severe protein
instability. Both girls developed chronic active EBV infection in early
childhood that was resistant to treatment. The disorder progressed to
lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, B-cell proliferation, and Hodgkin
lymphoma in 1 girl. There were extremely low levels of the protein in
lymph node biopsy from 1 of the girls. Both unaffected parents were
heterozygous for the mutation. The mutation was not identified in 100
Turkish and 100 German children.

Linka et al. (2012) showed that cells from the patients reported by Huck
et al. (2009) had a reduced calcium signaling response after TCR
stimulation and were unable to enhance calcium response in Itk-null
mouse cells, consistent with a loss of function.

.0002
LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE SYNDROME 1
ITK, TYR588TER

In 3 members of a consanguineous Arab family with lymphoproliferative
syndrome-1 (613011), Stepensky et al. (2011) identified a homozygous
c.1764C-G transversion in exon 16 of the ITK gene, resulting in a
tyr588-to-ter (Y588X) substitution that would disrupt the ITK kinase
domain. The mutation, which was found by homozygosity mapping followed
by candidate gene sequencing, segregated with the disorder in the
family. The patients presented between ages 3 and 5 years with fever,
lymphadenopathy, and Hodgkin lymphoma associated with EBV infection. One
patient was treated successfully with chemotherapy but later developed
fatal hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis; the second patient was treated
successfully with chemotherapy but later developed autoimmune renal
disease and was treated successfully with antiviral therapy; and the
third patient underwent successful bone marrow transplant from a donor
sib who was heterozygous for the mutation.

Linka et al. (2012) showed that cells from the patient reported by
Stepensky et al. (2011) had a reduced calcium signaling response after
TCR stimulation and were unable to enhance calcium response in Itk-null
mouse cells, consistent with a loss of function.

.0003
LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE SYNDROME 1
ITK, ARG29HIS

In a patient, born of consanguineous Moroccan parents, with
lymphoproliferative syndrome-1 (613011), Linka et al. (2012) identified
a homozygous c.86G-A transition in the ITK gene, resulting in an
arg29-to-his (R29H) substitution in the pleckstrin homology domain. The
patient was diagnosed at age 11 years with an EBV-associated B-cell
lymphoproliferative disorder. He also had autoimmune hemolytic anemia,
thrombocytopenia, and progressive lymphopenia. He died at age 26 years.
Patient cells had a reduced calcium signaling response after TCR
stimulation and were unable to enhance calcium response in Itk-null
mouse cells, consistent with a loss of function. In vitro studies showed
that the R29H mutation impeded membrane targeting of ITK.

611575	TITLE *611575 STERILE ALPHA MOTIF DOMAIN-CONTAINING 8; SAMD8
;;SPHINGOMYELIN SYNTHASE-RELATED; SMSR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences encoding motifs characteristic of
SM synthases (see 611573), Huitema et al. (2004) identified SAMD8, which
they called SMSR. The deduced 415-amino acid protein contains 5
membrane-spanning alpha helices connected by hydrophilic extramembrane
loops. SMSR also contains 4 highly conserved motifs, designated D1 to
D4.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the SAMD8 gene to chromosome 10q22.2 based on an
alignment of the SAMD8 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK057811) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

609451	TITLE *609451 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 90, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; ZFP90
;;NK10;;
KIAA1954
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lange et al. (1995) cloned mouse Zfp90, which they designated Nk10. The
predominant cDNA encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of
72.4 kD. The N-terminal half of Zfp90 contains KRAB A and B domains, and
the C-terminal half contains 13 C2H2-type zinc finger motifs. Lange et
al. (1995) also identified alternatively spliced Zfp90 cDNAs with
5-prime extensions of exons 4 and 5. Northern blot analysis detected a
2.4-kb transcript expressed at highest levels in brain, heart, spleen,
and thymus. RT-PCR of mouse embryos detected Zfp90 expression
predominantly in brain. At about postnatal week 2, it was expressed in
most other tissues tested. At postnatal days 18 to 20, it was detected
in testicular tissue, simultaneous with the appearance of haploid cells.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) obtained a partial ZFP90 clone, which they
designated KIAA1954. The transcript contains 2 SINEs in its 3-prime UTR.
The deduced protein shares 50% identity with ZNF471 and 85% identity
with Halobacterium transcription initiation factor IIB5. RT-PCR ELISA
detected intermediate to high expression in all adult and fetal tissues
and specific brain regions examined. Within whole tissues, highest ZPF90
expression was in spleen. Within specific brain regions, highest
expression was in caudate nucleus and substantia nigra.

GENE FUNCTION

Lange et al. (1995) demonstrated that mouse Zfp90 could bind DNA.
Binding was zinc dependent and required zinc fingers 2 through 8. The
KRAB domains of Zfp90 repressed reporter gene expression. The KRAB A
domain alone reduced reporter gene expression by 75 to 80%, and the KRAB
B domain reduced expression by 10 to 20%. Both domains together
repressed reporter gene expression nearly completely.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lange et al. (1995) determined that the mouse Zfp90 gene contains 5
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the ZFP90 gene
to chromosome 16. Using backcross analysis, Lange et al. (1995) mapped
the mouse Zfp90 gene to a region of chromosome 8D3 that shares homology
of synteny with human chromosome 16q22.1.

146740	TITLE *146740 Fc FRAGMENT OF IgG, LOW AFFINITY IIIa, RECEPTOR FOR; FCGR3A
;;IMMUNOGLOBULIN G Fc RECEPTOR III-2;;
FCRIII-2;;
CD16A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Fc receptor with low affinity for IgG (FCGR3, or CD16) is encoded by
2 nearly identical genes, FCGR3A and FCGR3B (610665), resulting in
tissue-specific expression of alternative membrane-anchored isoforms.
FCGR3A encodes a transmembrane protein expressed on activated
monocytes/macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and a subset of T
cells. In contrast, FCGR3B encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored protein that is expressed constitutively by neutrophils
and after gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) stimulation by eosinophils
(summary by Gessner et al., 1995).

CLONING

By Western blot and flow cytometric analyses, Ravetch and Perussia
(1989) demonstrated differential expression of FCGR3 on
polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and NK cells. The glycoprotein on
NK cells (FCGR3A) had a molecular mass 6 to 10 kD larger than that on
neutrophils (FCGR3B) and was resistant to phosphatidylinositol-specific
phospholipase C. Transcripts derived from FCGR3A and FCGR3B in NK cells
and PMNs, respectively, have multiple single nucleotide differences,
including 1 that converts a termination codon to a codon encoding arg,
thereby extending the cytoplasmic domain by 21 amino acids and
introducing a transmembrane anchor for FCGR3A in NK cells. The deduced
FCGR3A protein contains 254 amino acids, whereas the deduced FCGR3B
protein contains 233 amino acids. Ravetch and Perussia (1989) concluded
that cell type-specific expression of 2 genes encoding alternative FCGR3
proteins has a significant effect on the biologic functions of the
molecules.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gessner et al. (1995) isolated and sequenced genomic clones of FCGR3A
and FCGR3B, located their transcription initiation sites, identified the
different organizations of their 5-prime regions, and demonstrated 4
distinct classes of FCGR3A transcripts compared with a single class of
FCGR3B transcripts. The gene promoters displayed different
tissue-specific transcriptional activities reflecting expression of
FCGR3A in NK cells and FCGR3B in neutrophils.

MAPPING

Le Coniat et al. (1990) mapped the FCGR3A gene to chromosome 1q23 by in
situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Anderson et al. (1990) concluded that CD16 is included in the zeta
natural killer cell receptor complex (CD3Z; 186780).

Some gamma-delta T cells (see TCRG, 186970 and TCRD, 186810) express
CD16. Using flow cytometric analysis, Bodman-Smith et al. (2000)
examined the relative proportions of CD16+ gamma-delta T cells in the
blood and synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) patients
and the blood of control subjects. There was a significant reduction in
CD16+ gamma-delta T cells in synovial fluid compared with the
circulation. Mitogenic stimulation of circulating gamma-delta T cells
resulted in an increased expression of the HLA-DR activation marker and
a concomitant time-dependent decrease in the expression of CD16.
Bodman-Smith et al. (2000) concluded that CD16 expression is lost in the
synovial compartment as a result of activation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

On the natural killer (NK) cells of a 3-year-old boy who suffered from
recurrent viral respiratory tract infections since birth, de Vries et
al. (1996) found an unusual CD16 phenotype. The child also had severe
clinical problems with BCG vaccination and after Epstein-Barr virus and
varicella-zoster virus infections. His peripheral blood lymphocytes
contained a normal percentage and absolute number of CD3(-)CD7(+) cells,
which were positively stained with CD16 monoclonal antibodies. FCGR3
expression on granulocytes appeared to be normal. Sequence analysis of
the FCGR3A gene, encoding CD16 on NK cells and macrophages, showed a
T-to-A nucleotide substitution at position 230 on both alleles,
predicting a leucine to histidine amino acid change at position 48
(146740.0002).

By cloning and sequencing FCGR3A cDNA from NK cells and macrophages of a
heterozygous donor, de Haas et al. (1996) identified a 230T-G SNP that
resulted in a leu48-to-arg (L48R) substitution in the first
extracellular Ig-like domain and caused a higher electrophoretic
mobility of deglycosylated FCGR3A. PCR and restriction analysis
identified a 230T-A SNP, resulting in a leu48-to-his (L48H)
substitution, in another donor. Genotype analysis revealed a gene
frequency of 86% for 230T (L48), 6% for 230G (R48), and 8% for 230A
(H48) in 93 FCGR3B-positive individuals. In contrast, the frequency of
the 230G allele was significantly higher in 12 FCGR3B-deficient donors.
The H48 and R48 variants exhibited a higher binding capacity for IgG1,
IgG3, and IgG4 than did the common L48 variant. De Haas et al. (1996)
concluded that SNPs at position 230 of FCGR3A influence IgG binding, as
well as reactivity of CD16 monoclonal antibodies.

Koene et al. (1997) used PCR-based restriction analysis to genotype 87
donors for a 559T-G SNP in FCGR3A that results in a phe158-to-val
(F158V) substitution. They found gene frequencies of 57% and 43% for
F158 and V158, respectively. F158 was linked to L48, and V158 was linked
to R48 or H48. Through functional analysis, Koene et al. (1997)
determined that the previously identified differences in IgG binding
among the 3 FCGR3A variants at position 48 are a consequence of the
linked polymorphism at position 158.

Among 1,115 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) and 654
controls, Robinson et al. (2012) found no significant association
between FCGR3A copy number and disease.

Although nearly all adults have been exposed to herpes simplex virus
(HSV)-1, the clinical course of infection varies remarkably. By
analyzing the contribution of gene families on chromosomes 1, 6, 12, and
19 to susceptibility to HSV-1 infection in 302 individuals, Moraru et
al. (2012) identified no specific susceptibility locus. However, they
found that the risk of suffering clinical HSV-1 infection was modified
by MHC class I allotypes, HLA-C1 (142840) interaction with KIR2DL2
(604937), and the phe/val polymorphism at codon 158 of CD16A.

EVOLUTION

By determining the nature and rate of copy number variation (CNV)
mutation and investigating the global variation of disease-associated
variation at the FCGR locus, Machado et al. (2012) determined that CNV
of the FCGR3 genes is mediated by recurrent nonallelic homologous
recombination between the 2 segmental duplications that carry FCGR3A and
FCGR3B. They showed that pathogen richness, particularly helminth
pathogens, is likely to have influenced the patterns of variation in
FCGRs in humans. Machado et al. (2012) proposed that alterations to IgG
binding in the context of helminth infection have driven positive
selection in FCGR among different mammalian species, linking
evolutionary pressure of helminth infection with autoimmune disease via
adaptation at the genetic level. This model supports the 'hygiene
hypothesis,' which states that in the absence of chronic helminth
infection in modern populations, previously selected alleles respond to
immune system challenges differently and therefore may alter
susceptibility to autoimmune disease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) found that Fcrg (FCER1G; 147139) -/-
mice showed reduced mortality in an acute peritonitis model caused by
cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) compared with wildtype mice. The
reduced mortality in Fcrg -/- mice was associated with lower serum and
peritoneal Tnf (191160) and significantly increased capacity of
neutrophils and macrophages to phagocytose E. coli. Fcgr3 -/- mice also
had reduced sepsis after CLP. Fcgr3 bound E. coli, inducing Fcrg
phosphorylation, recruitment of tyrosine phosphatase Shp1 (PTPN6;
176883), and dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K;
see 171834). Decreased Pi3k activity inhibited E. coli phagocytosis and
increased Tnf production through Tlr4 (603030). Confocal microscopy
demonstrated negative regulation of Marco (604870) by Fcrg. Interaction
of E. coli with Fcgr3 induced recruitment of Shp1 to Marco and inhibited
E. coli phagocytosis. Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) concluded that
binding of E. coli to FCGR3 triggers an inhibitory FCRG pathway that
impairs MARCO-mediated bacterial clearance and activates TNF secretion.

FCGR3A, LEU48HIS

In a 3-year-old boy who had suffered from recurrent viral respiratory
tract infections since birth, de Vries et al. (1996) found an unusual
CD16 phenotype on the natural killer (NK) cells. Sequence analysis of
the IGFR3 gene showed a T-to-A nucleotide substitution at position 230
on both alleles, predicting a leucine-to-histidine amino acid change at
position 48 in the first extracellular Ig-like domain of the FCGR3A
protein. The child had also had severe problems with BCG vaccination and
with Epstein-Barr virus and varicella-zoster virus infections. The
clinical pattern was considered compatible with an in vivo dysfunction
of NK cells. Only 1 patient with absolute NK cell deficiency had been
previously described. Biron et al. (1989) reported the case of an
adolescent with recurrent life-threatening herpesvirus infections, who
completely lacked CD16 and/or CD56 positive cells in vivo and
NK-activity in vitro. In a note added in proof, de Vries et al. (1996)
called attention to the case of homozygosity for a IGFR3 mutation
reported by Jawahar et al. (1996).
