DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ST3GAL3 gene encodes
beta-galactoside-alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase-III, a Golgi resident
membrane protein that forms the sialyl Lewis a (sLe-a) epitope on
glyocoproteins. These glycoproteins form the glycocalyx, composed of
sialic acids that act as key determinants of a variety of cellular
recognition and communication processes (summary by Hu et al., 2011).

CLONING

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with a probe based on the
sialyl motif (a highly conserved region in the catalytic domain of
sialyltransferases), Kitagawa and Paulson (1993) isolated a cDNA
encoding SIAT6, which they termed ST3N (EC 2.4.99.6). The deduced
375-amino acid protein is 97% identical to the rat protein. SDS-PAGE
analysis showed expression of an 80-kD protein having sialyltransferase
activity. Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript with abundant expression in skeletal muscle and high
expression in fetal tissue but low expression in placenta.

Using Northern blot analysis, Kitagawa and Paulson (1994) evaluated the
differential expression of 5 human sialyltransferase genes in adult and
fetal tissues. A 2.7-kb ST3N transcript was expressed highly in skeletal
muscle and moderately in most other tissues examined. A 3.8-kb
transcript was also expressed in testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Taniguchi et al. (2003) determined that the 5-prime UTR of the ST3GAL3
gene consists of 2 exons. The 5-prime flanking region of the promoter
lacks canonical TATA or CCAAT boxes, but it contains several putative
transcriptional factor binding sites.

Hu et al. (2011) stated that the ST3GAL3 gene contains 15 exons, 12 of
which are coding exons.

MAPPING

The International RH Mapping Consortium mapped the SIAT6 gene to
chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG22084).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Recessive Mental Retardation 12

In affected members of 2 unrelated consanguineous Iranian families with
autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090),
Hu et al. (2011) used linkage analysis, chromosome sorting, and
next-generation sequencing to identify 2 different homozygous mutations
in the ST3GAL3 gene (A13D, 606494.0001 and D370Y, 606494.0002,
respectively.) Neither mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl
motifs, but rather affected the N-terminal transmembrane domain and
catalytic domain, respectively. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutant proteins were mislocalized to the endoplasmic
reticulum and that one (D370Y) had loss of catalytic activity. The
findings demonstrated a link between the glycoprotein complex,
sialyltransferase activity, and higher cognitive functioning.

- Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 15

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous mutation in the ST3GAL3 gene (A320P;
606494.0003). The mutation was identified by linkage analysis combined
with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. The mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl motif S,
which is crucially involved in binding of both donor and acceptor
substrate. In vitro functional expression studies showed that secretion
of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of control levels and it had no
detectable enzymatic activity. The phenotype was severe: patients showed
delayed psychomotor development and had onset of refractory infantile
spasms between ages 3 and 7 months associated with hypsarrhythmia on
EEG. Other features included hypotonia, poor eye contact, and inability
to speak or walk, even later in childhood. All were profoundly mentally
retarded. Edvardson et al. (2013) noted that the phenotype was more
severe than that observed by Hu et al. (2011), who had identified
ST3GAL3 mutations outside of the highly conserved and functionally
important sialyl motifs.

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), previously reported by
Najmabadi et al. (2007), Hu et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 38C-A
transversion in exon 2 of the ST3GAL3 gene, resulting in an ala13-to-asp
(A13D) substitution in the transmembrane domain. The mutation was not
found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls or
in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that most of the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. Catalytic activity of the A13D mutant enzyme was similar to
wildtype.

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), Hu et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1108G-T transversion in exon 14 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an asp370-to-tyr (D370Y) substitution in the
catalytic domain at the C-terminal end of the protein. The mutation was
not found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls
or in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. The D370Y mutant protein also showed a complete lack of enzyme
activity. Studies of recombinant proteins in CHO cells indicated that
secretion of the D370Y mutant protein was dramatically reduced compared
to wildtype. Hu et al. (2011) concluded that the mutant protein was
cleared by the endoplasmic reticulum-mediated system, suggesting that
the C terminus is important for the proper folding of functional
ST3GAL3.

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile

identified a homozygous 958G-C transversion in exon 12 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an ala320-to-pro (A320P) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in the sialyl motif S. The mutation was identified by
linkage analysis combined with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual
and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. It segregated with the disorder in
the family and was not found in 123 controls of the same ethnic origin
or in 5,379 control exomes. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that secretion of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of
control levels and that the protein had no detectable enzymatic
activity.

190450	TITLE *190450 TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE 1; TPI1
;;TPI
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Triosephosphate isomerase (TPI; EC 5.3.1.1) catalyzes the
interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (summary by Ationu et al., 1999).

CLONING

Electrophoretic variants of triosephosphate isomerase were identified by
the Galton Laboratory group (Hopkinson and Harris, 1971).

Brown et al. (1985) isolated the functional gene and 3 intronless
pseudogenes for human TPI from a recombinant DNA library. The
pseudogenes share a high degree of homology with the functional gene but
contain mutations that preclude synthesis of active TPI enzyme. Sequence
divergence indicated origin of the pseudogenes about 18 million years
ago. Brown et al. (1985) concluded that the human TPI gene family has
only 1 functional gene.

Yuan et al. (1979), on the basis of structural analysis, concluded that
the TPI-A and TPI-B isozymes are products of distinct structural loci.
Decker and Mohrenweiser (1981) presented evidence that triosephosphate
isomerase isozymes are the expression of a single structural locus. (The
existence of 2 TPI loci, both probably coded by chromosome 12, had been
suggested to explain the observed isozyme patterns.) They identified a
rare electrophoretic variant and found that the variant phenotype was
expressed in the TPI-B isozyme of both red cells and circulating
lymphocytes and was also expressed in the TPI-A isozyme of
mitogen-stimulated lymphoblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

TPI is a dimeric enzyme of identical subunits that is characterized by a
high constitutive level of activity in all tissues. It is involved in
both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, catalyzing the interconversion of
DHAP and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. TPI is one of the most efficient
enzymes known, enhancing proton transfer by a factor of 10(10), and is
the least rate-limiting step in glycolysis (summary by Watanabe et al.,
1996).

GENE STRUCTURE

Brown et al. (1985) found that the functional TPI1 gene spans 3.5 kb and
is split into 7 exons.

MAPPING

From study of 3 patients with different deletions of chromosome 12,
Rethore et al. (1976, 1977) concluded that the GAPD locus (138400) is on
the distal part of 12p, between 12p12.2 and 12pter, and that the LDHB
locus (150100) is on the middle third between 12p12.1 and 12p12.2. The
results for TPI were like those for GAPD, suggesting the same distal
localization.

Law and Kao (1978) summarized data suggesting the order
12pter--TPI--GAPD--SHMT (SHMT2; 138450) on chromosome 12. SHMT lies on
the proximal part of 12q between the centromere and PEPB (169900).

Brown et al. (1985) confirmed that the functional TPI gene is on
chromosome 12 whereas the pseudogenes are on other chromosomes.

Asakawa and Iida (1985) also found support for a single TPI locus. GPI
(172400) and PEPD (613230), which are on chromosome 19 in man, are on
chromosome 9 of the Chinese hamster, and TPI, which is on chromosome 12
of man, is on Chinese hamster chromosome 8 (Siciliano et al., 1983).

OTHER FEATURES

TPI was 1 of 4 representative 'ancient' proteins used by Stoltzfus et
al. (1994) to test the exon theory of genes. Spliceosomal introns are
present in the nuclear protein-coding genes of most eukaryotic
organisms, but they have not been detected in several eukaryotic protist
phyla or in eubacteria, archaebacteria, and organelles. Two major
theories had emerged in the continuing debate on the origin of these
introns. The exon theory of genes (sometimes called the introns-early
view) proposed that exons are the descendants of ancient mini-genes and
introns are the descendants of the spaces between them; genes large
enough to encode contemporary proteins were first assembled from sets of
exons; the machinery of splicing originated in an ancient RNA world; and
introns were lost completely from both kingdoms of bacteria as well as
several protist groups. In contrast, the insertional theory of intron
origin (also known as the introns-late view) holds that split genes
arise from uninterrupted genes by insertion of introns; genes large
enough to encode contemporary proteins first arose (presumably from
smaller genes) without the participation of introns; the machinery of
spliceosomal splicing arose from fragmented self-splicing introns; and
spliceosomal introns were never present in the ancestors of those
organisms that now lack them. The analysis performed by Stoltzfus et al.
(1994) on TPI, the globins, pyruvate kinase, and alcohol dehydrogenase
demonstrated no significant correspondence between exons and units of
protein structure, suggesting that the putative correspondence does not
exist and that the exon theory of genes is untenable.

The chicken-and-egg question of which came first--exons or introns--was
studied, using TPI as a model, also by Kwiatowski et al. (1995) and
Logsdon et al. (1995). Each group looked at the positions of introns in
homologous TPI genes from a number of phylogenetically diverse species.
Both groups concluded that introns were gained comparatively recently in
eukaryotic evolution by insertion into preexisting genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Eber et al. (1979) identified 5 persons heterozygous for a TPI null
allele.

Maquat et al. (1985) concluded that the genetic basis of TPI deficiency
is heterogeneous: normal levels of TPI mRNA were found in 1 homozygote
and about 40% of normal in another. The rare homozygous deficient
persons usually have 3 to 10% of normal enzyme activity.

Daar et al. (1986) and Pekrun et al. (1995) identified homoygosity for a
glu104-to-asp (E104D; 190450.0001) mutation in the TPI1 gene in patients
with triosephosphate deficiency. Arya et al. (1997) found that among 7
unrelated Northern European kindreds with clinical TPI deficiency, the
glu104-to-asp mutation accounted for 11 of 14 (79%) mutant alleles.
Haplotype analysis supported a founder effect.

Studies by Boyer et al. (1989) and Boyer and Maquat (1990) identified
several sequences in the 5-prime region that appear to be required for
maintenance of normal levels of gene expression. These include a CAP
proximal element (CPE) spanning nucleotides -6 and -12. The -5A-G and
-8G-A substitutions identified by Watanabe et al. (1996) are located
within the CPE region. The observation that all 7 affected individuals
shared the same variant CPE allele, an allele that does not exist at
higher frequency in the general African American population, suggested
to the authors a common origin for this TPI-deficiency allele; how the
allele frequency is maintained at such a high level was unclear.

Watanabe et al. (1996) undertook the molecular characterization of the
variant alleles from 7 African American and 3 Caucasian individuals from
the unrelated group identified in the frequency studies. In Caucasians
they found 3 amino acid substitutions, all in residues that are not
directly involved in the enzyme's active site but are highly conserved
through evolutionary time, suggesting important roles for these residues
in maintenance of subunit structure and conformation. One of the amino
acid substitutions, glu104-to-asp (190450.0001), had been previously
identified in cases of hemolytic anemia due to TPI deficiency. The
variant allele in the 7 African American individuals had nucleotide
changes at positions -8 and -5 on the 5-prime side of the
transcription-initiation site.

In a study of 424 African American subjects and 75 white subjects,
Schneider et al. (1998) found that the -5 (592A-G), -8 (382G-A), and -24
(573T-G) variants in the triosephosphate isomerase gene occurred
frequently (41%) in the African American subjects but did not occur in
whites. These data suggested that this set of polymorphisms may be one
of the higher-incidence molecular markers of African lineage. Although
the variant substitutions (occurring in 3 haplotypes: -5 alone, -5 -8,
and -5 -8 -24) were associated with moderate reduction in enzyme
activity, severe deficiency heterozygotes could not be identified with
certainty, and none of the haplotypes was restricted to subjects with
marked reduction of enzyme activity. Three subjects were homozygous for
the -5 -8 haplotype, a finding inconsistent with the putative role of
this haplotype as the cause of a null variant incompatible with life in
homozygotes, as had been suggested in the past for the rarity of
homozygotes with TPI deficiency in African Americans. Despite these
findings, Schneider et al. (1998) admitted the possibility that the -5
-8 or -5 -8 -24 haplotypes may in some instances contribute to compound
heterozygosity and clinical TPI deficiency.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gnerer et al. (2006) identified a recessive hypomorphic mutation in
Drosophila, which they called 'wasted away' (wstd), that causes
progressive motor impairment, vacuolar neuropathology, and severely
reduced life span. They found that wstd was caused by a mutation in the
Tpi1 gene. The mutation did not result in a significant deficit in ATP,
and the authors suggested that the lack of TPI1 activity may cause the
accumulation of toxic metabolites upstream of the enzymatic block.

HISTORY

From studies in the cri-du-chat syndrome (123450), Sparkes et al. (1969)
suggested that the TPI locus is on the short arm of chromosome 5. Others
failed to confirm this (Brock and Singer, 1970). Cell hybridization
studies indicated that the TPI locus is on chromosome 12.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, GLU104ASP

In 2 unrelated patients with TPI deficiency (615512), Daar et al. (1986)
found a guanine-to-cytosine transversion in the codon for amino acid
104, resulting in a structurally altered protein in which a glutamate
residue was replaced by an aspartate residue. The importance of
glutamate-104 to enzyme structure and function was indicated by its
conservation in the TPI protein of all species characterized to date.
The glutamate-to-aspartate substitution resulted in a thermolabile
enzyme. The same mutation was identified in an Australian family by
Chang et al. (1993). The alteration of codon 104 was from GAG to GAC.

Pekrun et al. (1995) found this same mutation in a family with severe
TPI deficiency. The 1-year-old index patient suffered from hemolytic
anemia, neuromuscular impairment, and recurrent pneumonia, with the
necessity of intermittent mechanical ventilation. TPI activity in red
cells was reduced to about 20% of normal. Heat stability of the enzyme
was strongly reduced; concentration of the physiologic substrate,
dihydroxyacetone phosphate, was increased 20-fold due to the metabolic
block. During a second pregnancy, examination of a cord blood sample
obtained in the nineteenth gestational week showed that the infant was
homozygous normal. An unaffected, healthy newborn was delivered. The
parents were consanguineous and of Turkish origin.

Arya et al. (1997) found that among 7 unrelated Northern European
kindreds with clinical TPI deficiency, the glu104-to-asp mutation
accounted for 11 (79%) of 14 mutant alleles. In 3 families, molecular
analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for glu104 to asp and novel
missense mutations (see 190450.0004 and 190450.0005). The origin of the
glu104-to-asp mutation was defined by haplotype analysis using a novel
G/A polymorphism at nucleotide 2898 of the TPI gene. Cosegregation of
the low frequency 2898A allele with the G-to-C base change at nucleotide
315, responsible for the glu104-to-asp amino acid substitution,
supported a single origin for that mutation, i.e., founder effect.

TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE MANCHESTER
TPI-MANCHESTER
TPI1, GLY122ARG

In a screening of more than 3,400 persons in an Ann Arbor, Michigan,
population, Perry and Mohrenweiser (1992) found only 1 example of a TPI
electromorph variant. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA products and subsequent
direct sequencing identified a G-to-A transition causing a replacement
of gly122 with arg in this electrophoretic mobility variant of TPI which
was referred to as TPI-Manchester. The substitution was at the amino
terminus or solvent interaction end of the fifth beta sheet of the
alpha/beta barrel structure. TPI-Manchester was found to be thermolabile
but the stability of the variant enzyme was not sensitive to other
denaturants.

.0003
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI-HUNGARY
TPI1, PHE240LEU

In a Hungarian family, Chang et al. (1993) found that the proband with
TPI deficiency (615512), who had chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia
but no neuromuscular disabilities, was a genetic compound. One of the
mutations was a missense mutation within codon 240 that changed TTC
(phe) to CTC (leu) and created a thermolabile protein. The substitution
occurred in a phylogenetically conserved amino acid and affected enzyme
activity by disrupting intersubunit contacts or substrate binding, as
deduced from enzyme structural studies. The nature of the other mutation
was not identified (see 190450.0006), but it had the effect of reducing
the abundance of TPI mRNA 10- to 20-fold. The same family was also
reported by Hollan et al. (1993) who gave clinical details on the
13-year-old boy with congenital hemolytic anemia and hyperkinetic
torsion dyskinesia associated with severe TPI deficiency, and on his
brother, a 23-year-old amateur wrestler, who also had congenital
hemolytic anemia but no neurologic symptoms. The latter was the proband
in the study of Chang et al. (1993), which demonstrated compound
heterozygosity. (Hollan et al. (1993) incorrectly referred to the
brothers as being double heterozygotes.) Both had less than 10% TPI
activity and a greatly increased dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) level
in their red blood cells. Their TPI had a slow electrophoretic mobility
and was heat unstable. Both parents and a third brother were healthy
heterozygotes. The older brother represented a unique phenotype since
all published homozygotes had severe neurologic alterations from infancy
or early childhood except 1 infant who died at 11 months, probably too
young for neurologic symptoms to be noted. Furthermore, in contrast to
the 2 affected Hungarian brothers, all but 1 homozygote had died before
the age of 6 years.

TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, CYS41TYR

In 2 families with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency (615512), Arya
et al. (1997) found compound heterozygosity for the common glu104-to-asp
mutation (190450.0001) and a previously unknown missense mutation, cys41
to tyr, due to a TGT-to-TAT transition.

.0005
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, ILE170VAL

In a family with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency (615512), Arya et
al. (1997) found that affected individuals showed compound
heterozygosity for the common glu104-to-asp substitution (190450.0001)
and a novel ile170-to-val missense mutation.

.0006
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, GLU145TER

In a Hungarian family with severe TPI deficiency (615512) originally
described by Chang et al. (1993), Orosz et al. (2001) analyzed 2
germline-identical but phenotypically different brothers who were
compound heterozygotes for the F240L mutation (190450.0003) and a
glu145-to-ter (E145X) mutation. The kinetic, thermodynamic, and
associative properties of the recombinant human wildtype and F240L
mutant enzymes were compared with those of TPIs in normal and deficient
erythrocyte hemolysates. The specific activity of the recombinant mutant
enzyme relative to the wildtype was much higher (30%) than expected from
the activity (3%) measured in hemolysates. Comparative studies of the
hemolysate from a British patient with glu104-to-asp (190450.0001)
homozygosity (Ationu et al., 1999) and the platelet lysates from the
Hungarian family suggested that the microcompartmentation of TPI is not
unique for the hemolysates from the Hungarian TPI-deficient brothers.

147360	TITLE *147360 INVOLUCRIN; IVL
DESCRIPTION The crosslinked envelope of the keratinocyte is formed in the last stage
of its terminal differentiation. This envelope is made up of membrane
and cytosolic proteins crosslinked by glutamyl lysine isopeptide bonds.
The most abundant component is involucrin, a keratinocyte protein that
appears first in the cytoplasm but ultimately becomes crosslinked to
membrane proteins by transglutaminase. Eckert and Green (1986) cloned
the involucrin gene and studied its structure and evolution. The gene
consists of 585 amino acids, 390 of which form a central decapeptide
repeat, rich in glutamine and glutamic acid. Teumer and Green (1989)
described the divergent evolution of the IVL gene in gorilla and human.
Green and Djian (1992) reviewed the alterations in the involucrin gene
during evolution of primates from nonprimates. As reflected in the 17
species examined, the changes involved short tandem repeats. Evolution
of the IVL gene took place through mechanisms that shortened the length
of the repeats, increased their number, and changed their codon
sequence. As part of this trend, one entire segment of repeats was
replaced by another located elsewhere in the coding region.

Stroh et al. (1987) used a genomic clone to probe a panel of
human-rodent somatic cell hybrids and map the involucrin gene to
chromosome 1. By in situ hybridization using the same probe, maximal
hybridization was observed to bands 1q21-q22, with weak hybridization to
1p35-p36. They concluded that band 1q21 is the most likely location of
the IVL gene. Simon et al. (1989) presented the data for mapping of the
IVL gene. They also described a PstI RFLP, which they demonstrated in 1
individual to be the absence of 39 repeats that make up two-thirds of
the coding region of the IVL gene. Simon et al. (1991) gave further
information on the polymorphism in the coding region in the involucrin
gene in higher primates, which results from the variable number of
tandem repeats (VNTR) of a 10-codon sequence. Confirmation of the
localization of the IVL gene to 1q21 was provided by Volz et al. (1993),
who demonstrated physical linkage within 2.05 Mb of DNA to several other
genes involved in epidermal differentiation and known to be located in
that area.

Green (1993) pointed to the relevance of the expanded poly(CAG) in the
coding region of genes leading to 3 disorders: spinal and bulbar
muscular atrophy (313200), Huntington disease (143100), and
spinocerebellar ataxia type I (164400). Multiple glutamine residues,
usually encoded by CAG, are necessary for the crosslinking of involucrin
to other proteins by the keratinocyte transglutaminase during terminal
differentiation in the keratinocytes with formation of the insoluble
envelope of the corneocyte. Reiteration of the CAG codon appears to be
very frequent. Of all the animal and plant protein sequences in 2
databases, Green (1993) found that 33 contained a sequence of 16 or more
reiterated glutamines, but not one contained a run of more than 38
glutamines; hence, all showed a number of repeats lower than that in the
abnormal alleles of the 3 human diseases of CAG reiteration. Therefore,
reiteration must in some way be restricted in order to prevent genomic
havoc.

The IVL gene has evolved rapidly in higher primates (Green and Djian,
1992). Djian et al. (1995) observed that, although all mammalian IVL
genes examined to date possess a segment of short tandem repeats in the
coding region, the higher primates possess a segment of repeats that is
different from that of other mammals. This segment has enlarged
progressively mainly in the region not far from the 5-prime end of the
segment of repeats. The site of recent repeat additions is located in
the late region, which is polymorphic with respect to number of repeats
in most higher primates, including the human. The repeat pattern in the
late region of the human IVL gene does not resemble that of other
hominoids. Caucasians and Africans were found by Simon et al. (1991) and
by Urquhart and Gill (1993) to differ in repeat patterns within this
region and at certain nucleotide positions. Djian et al. (1995) observed
that there are over 8 polymorphic forms based on the number and kind of
10-codon tandem repeats in that part of the coding region most recently
added in the human lineage. The IVL alleles of Caucasians and Africans
differ both in nucleotide sequence and repeat patterns. Djian et al.
(1995) showed that the IVL alleles in East Asians (Chinese and Japanese)
can be divided into 2 populations according to whether they possess the
2 marker nucleotides typical of Africans or Caucasians. The Asian
population bearing Caucasian-type marker nucleotides had repeat patterns
similar to those of Caucasians, whereas Asians bearing African-type
marker nucleotides had repeat patterns resembling those of Africans more
than those of Caucasians. The existence of 2 populations of East Asian
IVL alleles gave support for the existence of a Eurasian stem lineage
from which Caucasians and a part of the Asian population originated.

Lopez-Bayghen et al. (1996) characterized the 5-prime noncoding region
of IVL and concluded that the region contains a distal
CaCl(2)-responsive enhancer, a putative transcriptional silencer, and a
proximal enhancer.

604769	TITLE *604769 PEROXIREDOXIN 3; PRDX3
;;PRX3;;
ANTIOXIDANT PROTEIN 1; AOP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Peroxiredoxins inactivate H2O2 by oxidizing a key cysteine residue in
their catalytic center, which is subsequently reduced by thioredoxins
(see 187700). The thioredoxins are subsequently reduced by electrons
from NADPH via thioredoxin reductases (see TXNRD1; 601112). PRDX3 is
localized exclusively in mitochondria (summary by Chiribau et al.,
2008).

CLONING

The mouse Aop1 protein, also called Mer5, may promote early events in
the differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells (Nemoto et
al., 1990). Tsuji et al. (1995) found that mouse Aop1 shares 38% amino
acid sequence identity with the C22 subunit of Salmonella typhimurium
alkylhydroperoxide reductase.

By screening a human leukemia cell line cDNA library with a mouse Aop1
cDNA, Tsuji et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA encoding human AOP1. The
deduced 256-amino acid human AOP1 protein shares 86% amino acid sequence
similarity with mouse Aop1, and significant similarity with both the
human proliferation-associated gene A product (PAGA; 176763) and the
mouse stress-induced peritoneal macrophage protein Msp23. AOP1 also
shows sequence similarity to the S. cerevisiae thiol-specific
antioxidant protein TSA; a surface antigen of Entamoeba histolytica,
which is a pathogenic protozoan that causes diarrhea and organ abscess
formation; and a protein of H. pylori, which is a causative agent in
gastritis, ulcers, and gastric adenocarcinoma.

GENE FUNCTION

Tsuji et al. (1995) demonstrated that recombinant mouse Aop1 could
complement an alkylhydroperoxide reductase mutation in E. coli,
suggesting that Aop1 functions as an antioxidant protein.

Shih et al. (2001) determined that AOP1 interacts with Abrin A-chain
(ABRA), which inhibits protein synthesis and can induce apoptosis. By
immunolocalization studies, they determined that both AOP1 and ABRA
colocalize within the mitochondria. By assays of thiol-dependent
antioxidant activity, they determined that ABRA can attenuate AOP1
activity in a dose-dependent manner. Ectopic expression of AOP1 also
blocked the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and inhibited
apoptosis in ABRA-treated cells.

Deregulated expression of the MYC transcription factor (190080) is found
in a wide variety of human tumors. The primary transforming activity of
MYC is thought to arise through transcriptional regulation of numerous
target genes. Wonsey et al. (2002) showed that PRDX3, which encodes a
mitochondrial protein of the peroxiredoxin gene family, is such a
target. Expression of PRDX3 is induced by MYC and is reduced in c-myc
-/- cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis spanning the entire
PRDX3 genomic sequence revealed that MYC binds preferentially to a
930-bp region surrounding exon 1. Wonsey et al. (2002) showed that PRDX3
is required for MYC-mediated proliferation, transformation, and
apoptosis after glucose withdrawal. Results using mitochondria-specific
fluorescent probes demonstrated that PRDX3 is essential for maintaining
mitochondrial mass and membrane potential in transformed rat and human
cells. These data provided evidence that PRDX3 is a MYC target gene that
is required to maintain normal mitochondrial function.

Chiribau et al. (2008) found that the forkhead box transcription factor
FOXO3A (602681) was required for basal expression of PRX3 in human
cardiac fibroblasts. They identified 2 FOXO regulatory sequences in the
promoter region of PRX3 and showed that binding of FOXO3A to both
regulatory sequences was required for FOXO3A-mediated activation of a
PRX3 reporter plasmid. Chiribau et al. (2008) concluded that FOXO3A
mediates PRX3 expression and suggested that this regulation may play a
critical role in the resistance to oxidative stress in cardiac
fibroblasts.

MAPPING

By FISH, Tsuji et al. (1995) mapped the human AOP1 gene, also known as
PRDX3, to 10q25-q26. They mapped the mouse Aop1 gene to the distal
region of chromosome 19.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening human brain cDNAs for the potential to encode proteins that
are at least 50 kD, Nagase et al. (1998) isolated an SLC21A9 cDNA, which
they called KIAA0880, that contains a complete coding sequence. The
predicted 709-amino acid SLC21A9 protein contains 8 membrane-spanning
regions. SLC21A9 shares 42.8% amino acid sequence identity with a rat
prostaglandin transporter across 678 residues. RT-PCR followed by ELISA
detected SLC21A9 expression in all human tissues examined, with the
highest expression in liver, lower expression in lung, ovary, brain,
heart, kidney, pancreas, spleen, and testis, and lowest expression in
skeletal muscle.

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to OATP (SLCO1A2;
602883), followed by RT-PCR of adult brain RNA, Tamai et al. (2000)
cloned SLCO2B1, which they designated OATPB. The deduced 709-amino acid
protein has 12 potential transmembrane regions and several
phosphorylation and N-glycosylation sites. RT-PCR detected OATPB
expression in adult pancreas, liver, lung, gut, ovary, testis, and
spleen, and in all fetal tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) are a family of
multispecific carriers that mediate the sodium-independent transport of
steroid hormone and conjugates, drugs, and numerous anionic endogenous
substrates. St-Pierre et al. (2002) investigated whether members of the
OATP gene family could mediate fetal-maternal transfer of anionic
steroid conjugates in the human placenta. They isolated OATPB from a
placenta cDNA library. An antiserum to OATPB detected an 85-kD protein
in basal but not apical syncytiotrophoblast membranes.
Immunohistochemistry of first-, second-, and third-trimester placenta
showed staining in the cytotrophoblast membranes and at the basal
surface of the syncytiotrophoblast. Trophoblasts that reacted with an
antibody to Ki-67, a proliferation-associated antigen, expressed lower
levels of OATPB. OATPB mRNA levels were measured in isolated
trophoblasts under culture conditions that promoted syncytia formation.
Real-time quantitative PCR estimated an 8-fold increase in OATPB
expression on differentiation to syncytia. Pregnenolone sulfate
partially inhibited OATPB-mediated transport of estrone-3-sulfate in an
oocyte expression system. The authors concluded that these findings
suggested a physiologic role for OATPB in the placental uptake of
fetal-derived sulfated steroids.

Tamai et al. (2000) overexpressed OATPB in HEK293 cells and found that
it mediated transport of estrone-3-sulfate and, more weakly,
prostaglandin E2.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid mapping panel, Nagase et al. (1998)
mapped the SLC21A9 gene to chromosome 11. By radiation hybrid analysis,

614206	TITLE *614206 CHROMATIN TARGET OF PRMT1; CHTOP
;;CHROMOSOME 1 OPEN READING FRAME 77; C1OORF77;;
SMALL PROTEIN RICH IN ARGININE AND GLYCINE; SRAG;;
FRIEND OF PRMT1; FOP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By PCR of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Zullo et al. (2009) cloned 3 splice
variants of CHTOP, which they called SRAG, SRAG3, and SRAG5. SRAG
encodes the full-length 248-amino acid protein, which contains a central
arginine- and glycine-rich domain similar to that found in nucleolin
(NCL; 164035) and fibrillarin (FBL; 134795). Compared with the
full-length SRAG protein, SRAG3 contains an N-terminal deletion, and
SRAG5 encodes a protein with a partial deletion within the arginine- and
glycine-rich domain. Western blot analysis of mouse tissues revealed
widespread Srag expression, with highest levels in thymus, spleen, and
lymph node. Srag3 was expressed in lung only, and Srag5 was expressed in
stomach only. Endogenous HEK293 cell SRAG protein migrated as a doublet
with an apparent molecular mass of about 28 kD. Cell fractionation and
extraction experiments revealed that SRAG was predominantly a nuclear
protein, with some nucleolar localization. SRAG5, but not SRAG3, was
also detected in nucleoli. However, immunofluorescence microscopy of
transfected HeLa cells revealed that fluorescence-tagged SRAG and SRAG5
were nucleolar in 25 to 35% of cells, whereas SRAG3 was nucleolar in
nearly 100% of cells. Database analysis revealed SRAG orthologs in
vertebrates, but not invertebrates.

Van Dijk et al. (2010) cloned mouse Chtop, which they designated Fop,
and by database analysis, they identified full-length human FOP. The
mouse and human FOP proteins both contain 249 amino acids. A second FOP
isoform may be translated from a conserved internal methionine at
residue 26. Full-length FOP has a central glycine- and arginine-rich
(GAR) domain and 2 copies of a 9-amino acid sequence near the C
terminus. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse erythroleukemia (MEL)
cells revealed a punctate nuclear distribution. In day-16.5 mouse
embryos, Fop protein was expressed in heart, lung, gut, kidney,
submandibular gland, thymus, follicles of the vibrissae, muscle, brown
fat, and neuronal cells of brain, olfactory epithelium, and dorsal root
ganglia. Fop tightly associated with facultative heterochromatin in MEL
cells. Time-lapse imaging showed that fluorescence-tagged Fop released
from condensed chromosomes during mitosis and relocalized to chromatin
after cell division.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mutation analysis, Zullo et al. (2009) showed that the N-terminal
40 amino acids of full-length SRAG functioned as a nucleolar exclusion
signal. Treatment with an RNase or disruption of nucleolar ribosomal RNA
reduced nucleolar SRAG localization, suggesting that nucleolar SRAG
depends upon RNA. Srag protein expression was reduced following
activation of mouse thymocytes and during the G2/M phase of the cell
cycle in HeLa cells. Overexpression of SRAG in HeLa cells slowed cell
growth by reducing entry into the G2/M phase and by enhancing cell
death.

Using fetal mouse liver cells expressing the entire human beta-globin
cluster (see HBB; 141900), van Dijk et al. (2010) found that knockdown
of Fop via lentivirus infection upregulated the expression of human
fetal gamma-globin (see HBG1; 142200) within the beta-globin cluster, in
addition to upregulating expression of the embryonic mouse beta-globin
genes, epsilon-Y and beta-H1. Silencing of Fop did not alter expression
of the adult mouse globin genes beta-major and alpha-globin (see HBA1;
141800). Depletion of FOP from adult human erythroid progenitor cells
increased expression of embryonic epsilon-globin (HBE1; 142100) and
gamma-globin and decreased expression of adult beta-globin mRNA. The
embryonic zeta-globin gene (HBZ; 142310) within the alpha-globin cluster
was also reactivated following FOP depletion. FOP appeared to modulate
SOX6 (607257)-dependent silencing of gamma-globin in the adult erythroid
progenitor cells. Van Dijk et al. (2010) concluded that FOP is a
critical regulator of fetal globin gene expression.

Using yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, van Dijk et al.
(2010) found that mouse Fop interacted with the methyltransferase Prmt1
(602950). The GAR domain of Fop was heavily methylated by Prmt1 and
Prmt5 (604045) in vitro and in vivo, and both methyltransferases
competed for Fop binding. Knockdown of FOP in estrogen-responsive MCF7
human breast cancer cells via small interfering RNA almost completely
blocked estrogen-induced promoter occupancy by ER-alpha (ESR1; 133430)
and reduced expression of the estrogen-responsive genes PS2 (TFF1;
113710), lactoferrin (LTF; 150210), and TGF-alpha (TGFA; 190170).

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the CHTOP gene to chromosome 1q21.3 based on an
alignment of the CHTOP sequence (GenBank GENBANK AL050260) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Zullo et al. (2009) found that Srag knockout in mice was embryonic
lethal and incompatible with viability in mouse embryonic fibroblasts
and stem cells.

;;SPFH DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; SPFH2;;
CHROMOSOME 8 OPEN READING FRAME 2; C8ORF2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, followed by PCR and RACE of adult and
fetal cDNA libraries, Ikegawa et al. (1999) cloned 2 splice variants of
ERLIN2, which they designated C8ORF2. The deduced 339- and 152-amino
acid proteins share the first 141 N-terminal amino acids, then diverge.
Both proteins have an N-glycosylation site and type-2 membrane topology,
and the longer protein has a lysine- and glutamic acid-rich region.
Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of 1.6- and 2.5-kb
transcripts; a minor 4.4-kb transcript was also observed.

Using monoclonal antibodies to human lipid raft proteins, Browman et al.
(2006) identified ERLIN1 (611604) and ERLIN2 as components of lipid
rafts. Immunohistochemical analysis of endogenous and
fluorescence-tagged proteins revealed that ERLIN1 and ERLIN2 localized
specifically to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope. The
2 proteins share 83% identity, and both contain a conserved prohibitin
(PHB; 176705) homology domain of about 160 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

The ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway removes aberrant proteins
and metabolically regulated native proteins from the ER. Pearce et al.
(2007) found that SPFH2 associated rapidly with activated IP3 receptors
(see IP3R1; 147265), which are substrates for the ERAD pathway, in
various mammalian cell lines. A proportion of SPFH2 associated with
several components of the ERAD pathway, and RNA interference-mediated
depletion of SPFH2 inhibited polyubiquitination and degradation of IP3R1
and turnover of model ERAD substrates. Pearce et al. (2007) concluded
that SPFH2 is a key ERAD pathway component that may act as a substrate
recognition factor.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ikegawa et al. (1999) determined that the ERLIN2 gene contains 16 exons
and spans more than 16.5 kb. The first 4 exons encode alternative
5-prime UTRs, exon 5 contains the initiating methionine, and exons 10
and 16 encode alternative 3-prime UTRs.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ikegawa et al. (1999) mapped the ERLIN2
gene to chromosome 8p11.2.

CYTOGENETICS

By autozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene sequencing in a
consanguineous Saudi family with complicated SPG18 (611225), Alazami et
al. (2011) identified a homozygous 20-kb deletion on chromosome 8, with
the distal breakpoint near physical position 37,694,857 (NCBI36) and the
proximal breakpoint near 37,714,575 immediately upstream of exon 2 of
the ERLIN2 gene. This 20-kb interval spans 2 protein-coding genes,
ERLIN2 and FLJ34378. RT-PCR analysis of patient lymphoblasts showed loss
of ERLIN2 transcription, consistent with a null allele. Alazami et al.
(2011) noted that ERLIN2 is involved in the endoplasmic
reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, and postulated that
loss of ERLIN2 may result in persistent activation of IP3 signaling and
neuronal channel activity since ERAD normally degrades IP3 receptors.
Alazami et al. (2011) concluded that ERLIN2 depletion caused the
phenotype, although they could not exclude a role for FLJ34378.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with autosomal
recessive spastic paraplegia-18 (SPG18; 611225), Yildirim et al. (2011)
identified a truncation mutation in the ERLIN2 gene (611605.0001) by
linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing. The authors
termed the disorder 'intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, and
contractures (IDMDC).' Affected individuals presented between ages 6
months and 2 years with an arrest and regression of motor function. They
developed progressive severe contractures of all joints, resulting in
severe motor disability and a fixed position. All had severe
intellectual disability, and none could speak, read, or write. Features
suggestive of spasticity included hyperactive reflexes, ankle clonus,
and extensor plantar responses, but the neurologic examination was
difficult to perform in most. Electron microscopy of white blood cells
from 2 affected sibs showed large membrane-bound vacuoles containing
flocculent material in 7 to 10% of cells, and these vacuoles appeared to
be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum.

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with autosomal
recessive intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, and contractures,
or spastic paraplegia-18 (SPG18; 611225), Yildirim et al. (2011)
identified a 2-bp insertion (812insAC) in exon 11 of the ERLIN2 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination in the
oligomerization domain. The protein was predicted to be truncated by
20%, but the mutant transcript did not appear to undergo
nonsense-mediated decay. The mutation was not found in 109 control
individuals.

176945	TITLE *176945 EPHRIN RECEPTOR EphA8; EPHA8
;;EPH- AND ELK-RELATED KINASE; EEK;;
PROTEIN TYROSINE KINASE EEK;;
HEK3
DESCRIPTION See EPH (EPHA1; 179610) for background on Eph receptors and their
ligands, the ephrins. Chan and Watt (1991) identified human and rat DNAs
encoding 2 novel members of the EPH subclass of putative receptor
protein-tyrosine kinases. Rat cDNA clones encoding EEK (EPH- and
ELK-related kinase) were isolated from a brain cDNA library probed with
DNA encoding the kinase region of the insulin receptor-related receptor
(INSRR; 147671). The EEK protein was predicted to contain all the amino
acid residues conserved in the catalytic domains of protein-tyrosine
kinases and was most similar to 2 putative receptor protein-tyrosine
kinases of the EPH subclass, ELK (EPHB1; 600600) and EPH, showing 69 and
57% identity, respectively. Human genomic DNAs, encoding part of EEK as
well as another putative protein tyrosine kinase most similar to ELK
(90%) and symbolized ERK (EPHB2; 600997) for ELK-related kinase, were
isolated and partially characterized. The novel identity of these 2
EPH-family genes was further supported by Southern blot analysis and
localization to human chromosome 1. In Northern blot analysis of rat
RNA, DNAs encoding rat EEK and human ERK hybridized to transcripts most
abundant in brain and lung, respectively. These 2 new members of the EPH
subclass of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, EEK and ERK, may
therefore have tissue-specific functions distinct from those of the
other EPH family members.

ANIMAL MODEL

Park et al. (1997) generated mice homozygous for a mutation that
disrupts the gene encoding EPHA8, a member of the Eph family of tyrosine
proteinase receptors. EphA8 -/- mice developed to term, were fertile,
and did not display obvious anatomical or physiologic defects. The mouse
EphA8 gene is expressed primarily in a rostral to caudal gradient in the
developing tectum. Axonal tracing experiments revealed that in these
mutant mice, axons from a subpopulation of tectal neurons located in the
superficial layers of the superior colliculus did not reach targets
located in the contralateral inferior colliculus. Moreover, EphA8-null
animals displayed an aberrant ipsilateral axonal tract that projected to
the ventral region of the cervical spinal cord. Retrograde labeling
revealed that these abnormal projections originated from a small
subpopulation of superior colliculus neurons that normally express the
EPHA8 gene. Park et al. (1997) suggested that EPHA8 receptors play a
role in axonal pathfinding during development of the mammalian nervous
system.

612962	TITLE *612962 DYNACTIN 5; DCTN5
;;p25
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dynactin (see 601143) is a multimeric protein essential for
minus-end-directed transport driven by the microtubule-based motor
dynein (see DYNC1H1; 600112). DCTN5 is a subunit of the pointed-end
subcomplex of dynactin that is thought to interact with membranous cargo
(Parisi et al., 2004).

CLONING

Eckley et al. (1999) identified Dctn5, which they called p25, as a
component of the pointed-end dynactin subcomplex in bovine brain. By
database analysis, they identified mouse p25, which encodes a 182-amino
acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 20.1 kD. Eckley et al.
(1999) also identified p25 orthologs in fly and worm.

By searching databases for proteins containing an isoleucine-patch motif
predicted to adopt a left-handed parallel beta-helix fold, Parisi et al.
(2004) identified mouse p25.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the DCTN5 gene to chromosome 16p12.2 based on an
alignment of the DCTN5 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK027387) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

607047	TITLE *607047 ATAXIN 3; ATXN3
;;AT3;;
MJD GENE; MJD1;;
SCA3 GENE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATXN3 has deubiquitinase activity and appears to be a component of the
ubiquitin proteasome system. It may also have roles in transcriptional
regulation and neuroprotection (summary by Haacke et al., 2006).

CLONING

To identify the gene affected by CAG expansion in Machado-Joseph disease
(MJD; 109150), Kawaguchi et al. (1994) isolated a cDNA with a CAG repeat
from a human brain cDNA library using an oligonucleotide probe with 13
CTG repeats, complementary to the CAG repeats. The cDNA, which they
designated MJD1, encodes a deduced 359-amino acid protein.

Goto et al. (1997) obtained 3 ATXN3 cDNAs from a human brain cDNA
library. Two of the cDNAs represent an ATXN3 variant that differs from
the cDNA reported by Kawaguchi et al. (1994) in splicing of the 3-prime
exons, resulting in a different C-terminal sequence in the protein. The
third cDNA has a stop codon polymorphism that results in additional
C-terminal amino acids. The deduced ATXN3 proteins, which range in size
from 360 to 374 amino acids, differ only at their C termini and in the
number of glutamines in the polyglutamine (polyQ) tract.

Schmitt et al. (1997) isolated rat Atxn3. They found that the rat and
human ATXN3 genes are highly homologous, with an overall sequence
identity of approximately 88%. However, the C-terminal end of the
putative rat protein differs strongly from the human sequence published
by Kawaguchi et al. (1994). The (CAG)n block in the rat cDNA consists of
only 3 interrupted units, suggesting that a long polyQ stretch is not
essential for normal function of the Atxn3 protein in rodents.
Transcription of rat Atxn3 was detected in most rat tissues, including
brain. In human brain sections, Schmitt et al. (1997) did not find
significantly higher ATXN3 mRNA levels in regions predominantly affected
in MJD, suggesting that additional molecules and/or regulatory events
are necessary to explain the exclusive degeneration of certain brain
areas in MJD.

Using immunohistochemistry of normal and MJD brain, Paulson et al.
(1997) showed that expression of ATXN3 was restricted to a limited
subset of neurons, particularly to those in the striatum. In normal and
diseased brain and in transfected cells, immunolocalization studies
revealed that ATXN3 was predominantly a cytoplasmic protein that
localized to neuronal processes as well.

Tait et al. (1998) studied the subcellular localization of full-length
ataxin-3 protein with a glutamine sequence in the normal range in 2
mammalian cell lines. By immunofluorescence and confocal laser scanning
microscopy, and by biochemical subcellular fractionations, they detected
the protein predominantly, but not exclusively, in the nucleus. The
ataxin-3 present in the nucleus of neuroblastoma cells associated with
the inner nuclear matrix. The authors concluded that the ataxin-3
protein, which contains a putative nuclear localization signal very
close to the glutamine tract, per se has the ability to be transported
into the nucleus and that an expanded glutamine repeat is not essential
for this transport.

Using Northern blot analysis, Ichikawa et al. (2001) showed that ATXN3
mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. They detected at least
4 ATXN3 transcripts of 1.4, 1.8, 4.5, and 7.5 kb and suggested that the
different mRNA species probably result from differential splicing and
polyadenylation.

Burnett et al. (2003) stated that the major human AT3 isoform contains
an N-terminal deubiquitinating domain, called the Josephin domain,
followed by 2 ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) and a polyQ tract near
the C terminus. In some isoforms, the polyQ tract is followed by a third
UIM. Burnett et al. (2003) identified a catalytic triad of cys14,
his119, and asn134 and other highly conserved residues within the
Josephin domain of AT3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ichikawa et al. (2001) determined that the ATXN3 gene spans 48,240 bp
and contains 11 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Kawaguchi et al. (1994) mapped the ATXN3 gene to chromosome
14q32.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a 2-hybrid system, Wang et al. (2000) found that ataxin-3
interacted with 2 human homologs of the yeast DNA repair protein RAD23,
HHR23A (RAD23A; 600061) and HHR23B (RAD23B; 600062). Both normal and
mutant ataxin-3 proteins interacted with the ubiquitin-like domain at
the N terminus of the HHR23 proteins, which is a motif important for
nucleotide excision repair. However, in HEK 293 cells, HHR23A was
recruited to intranuclear inclusions formed by the mutant ataxin-3 (see
MOLECULAR GENETICS) through its interaction with ataxin-3. The authors
suggested that this interaction may be associated with the normal
function of ataxin-3, and that some functional abnormality of the HHR23
proteins may exist in MJD.

By combining profile-based sequence analysis with genomewide functional
data in model organisms, Scheel et al. (2003) determined that ataxin-3
belongs to a novel group of cysteine proteases and is predicted to be
active against ubiquitin chains or related substrates. The catalytic
site of this enzyme class is similar to that found in UBP (see USP1;
603478)- and UCH (see UCHL3; 603090)-type ubiquitin proteases. They
suggested the finding had implications for disease pathogenesis by
providing a direct connection between SCA3 and ubiquitin metabolism.

Doss-Pepe et al. (2003) showed that both normal and polyQ-expanded human
ATXN3 associated with a number of proteasome subunits and with
ubiquitinated proteins. Truncation analysis showed that the UIMs of
ATXN3 bound polyubiquitin, but other factors in the full-length protein
increased the affinity of ATXN3 for polyubiquitin. Both normal and
polyQ-expanded ATXN3 inhibited formation of ubiquitin-conjugated histone
H2B (see 609904).

Burnett et al. (2003) showed that the UIM domain of AT3 bound ubiquitin
chains containing 4 or more ubiquitin units, the chain length required
for proteasome degradation. PolyQ-expanded AT3 showed similar binding to
ubiquitin chains. Both wildtype and pathologic AT3 also decreased the
degree of polyubiquitination of the test protein, iodinated lysosome,
suggesting that AT3 is a ubiquitin protease. AT3 was sensitive to a
specific ubiquitin protease inhibitor. Mutation of cys14 within the
Josephin domain to alanine reduced the ability of AT3 to remove
polyubiquitin chains from iodinated lysosome.

Winborn et al. (2008) showed that human ATXN3 bound both lys48- and
lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains, but preferentially cleaved lys63
linkages. ATXN3 showed greater activity toward mixed-linkage
polyubiquitin, cleaving lys63 linkages in chains that contained both
lys48 and lys63 linkages. PolyQ expansion did not alter the binding or
catalytic properties of ATXN3. The authors concluded that ATXN3 is a
mixed-linkage, chain-editing enzyme and that the UIM region of ATXN3
regulates its substrate specificity.

Mueller et al. (2009) showed that protein casein kinase-2 (CK2, see
115440)-dependent phosphorylation controlled the nuclear localization,
aggregation, and stability of ataxin-3. Ser340 and ser352 within the
third ubiquitin-interacting motif of ATXN3 were particularly important
for nuclear localization of normal and expanded ATXN3, and mutation of
these sites robustly reduced the formation of nuclear inclusions. A
putative nuclear leader sequence was not required. ATXN3 associated with
CK2-alpha (CSNK2A1; 115440), and pharmacologic inhibition of CK2
decreased nuclear ATXN3 levels and the formation of nuclear inclusions.
ATXN3 shifted to the nucleus upon thermal stress in a CK2-dependent
manner, suggesting a key role of CK2-mediated phosphorylation of ATXN3
in SCA3 pathophysiology.

Reina et al. (2010) showed that interactions of ATXN3 with
valosin-containing protein (VCP; 601023) and HHR23B were dynamic and
modulated by proteotoxic stresses. Heat shock, a general proteotoxic
stress, also induced wildtype and pathogenic ATXN3 to accumulate in the
nucleus. Mapping studies showed that 2 regions of ATXN3, the Josephin
domain and the C terminus, regulated heat shock-induced nuclear
localization. Atxn3-null mouse cells were more sensitive to toxic
effects of heat shock, suggesting that ATXN3 had a protective function
in the cellular response to heat shock. Oxidative stress also induced
nuclear localization of ATXN3; both wildtype and pathogenic ATXN3
accumulated in the nucleus of SCA3 patient fibroblasts following
oxidative stress. Heat shock and oxidative stress were the first
processes identified that increased nuclear localization of ATXN3. Reina
et al. (2010) suggested that the nucleus may be a key site for early
pathogenesis of SCA3.

Koch et al. (2011) showed that L-glutamate-induced excitation of
patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons
initiates calcium-dependent proteolysis of ATXN3 followed by the
formation of SDS-insoluble aggregates. This phenotype could be abolished
by calpain (see 114220) inhibition, confirming a key role of this
protease in ATXN3 aggregation. Aggregate formation was further dependent
on functional sodium and potassium channels as well as ionotropic and
voltage-gated calcium channels, and was not observed in iPSCs,
fibroblasts, or glia, thereby providing an explanation for the
neuron-specific phenotype of Machado-Joseph disease. Koch et al. (2011)
concluded that iPSCs enable the study of aberrant protein processing
associated with late-onset neurodegenerative disorders in
patient-specific neurons.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down studies, Araujo
et al. (2011) found that endogenous ATXN3 interacted directly with the
transcription factor FOXO4 (300033) in nuclear extracts of HeLa cells,
rat CSM14.1 mesencephalic cells, and mouse brain. The interaction
required the N-terminal Josephin domain of ATXN3. Expression of ATXN3
enhanced FOXO4-dependent expression of the antioxidant enzyme SOD2
(147460) in a manner independent of ATXN3 deubiquitinase activity.
Treatment of HeLa cells with H2O2 induced nuclear translocation of FOXO4
and ATXN3, enhanced binding of FOXO4 and ATXN3 to the SOD2 promoter, and
induced SOD2 expression. Coexpression of mutant ATXN3 with an expanded
polyglutamine tract or knockdown of ATXN3 via short hairpin RNA reduced
FOXO4 nuclear translocation and induction of SOD2. Lymphocytes from SCA3
patients exposed to oxidative stress showed reduced binding of FOXO4 to
the SOD2 promoter, concomitant with impaired upregulation of SOD2 and
enhanced oxidative cytotoxicity. Araujo et al. (2011) concluded that
ATXN3 stabilizes FOXO4 and acts as a transcriptional coactivator with
FOXO4 in the oxidative stress response.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- CAG Expansion in ATXN3 in Machado-Joseph Disease

In 8 of 9 patients with clinically diagnosed MJD, Kawaguchi et al.
(1994) identified CAG expansions of between 68 to 79 in the ATXN3 gene
(607047.0001). In normal individuals, the ATXN3 gene was found to
contain between 13 and 36 CAG repeats.

Kawaguchi et al. (1994) found a negative correlation between age of
onset and CAG repeat numbers. Southern blot analyses and genomic cloning
demonstrated the existence of related genes and raised the possibility
that similar abnormalities in related genes may give rise to diseases
similar to MJD.

- Pathogenic Effects of Polyglutamine Expansion in ATXN3

Paulson et al. (1997) showed that ATXN3 with a polyglutamine sequence in
the pathologic range accumulated in ubiquitinated intranuclear
inclusions selectively in neurons of affected brain regions. They
provided evidence in vitro for a model of disease in which an expanded
polyglutamine-containing fragment recruits full-length protein into
insoluble aggregates.

Evert et al. (1999) generated ataxin-3-expressing rat mesencephalic
CSM14.1 cells to study the effects of long-term expression of ataxin-3.
The isolated stable cell lines provided high level expression of human
full-length ataxin-3 with either the normal nonexpanded CAG repeats
(SCA3-Q23) or the pathogenic expanded CAG repeats (SCA3-Q70). When
cultured at a nonpermissive temperature (39 degrees C), CSM14.1 cells
expressing the expanded full-length ataxin-3 developed nuclear inclusion
bodies, strong indentations of the nuclear envelope, and cytoplasmic
vacuolation, whereas cells expressing the nonexpanded form and control
cells did not. The ultrastructural alterations resembled those found in
affected neurons of SCA3 patients. Cells with such changes exhibited
increased spontaneous nonapoptotic cell death.

Gaspar et al. (2000) explored the possibility that frameshift mutations
in expanded CAG tracts of ATXN3 can generate polyalanine mutant proteins
and form intranuclear inclusions. Antisera were raised against a
synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of ATXN3, which would
result from a frameshift within the CAG repeat motif with an intervening
polyalanine stretch. Corresponding proteins were evident in MJD patients
by Western blot analysis of lymphoblastoid proteins and in situ
hybridization of MJD pontine neurons. Transfection experiments suggested
that frameshifts are more likely to occur in longer CAG repeats and that
alanine polymers alone may be harmful to cells. The authors suggested
that a similar pathogenic mechanism may occur in other CAG repeat
disorders.

Toulouse et al. (2005) established a cellular model of transcript
frameshifting of expanded CAG tracts, resulting from ribosomal slippage
to the -1 frame exclusively. Ribosomal frameshifting depended on the
presence of long CAG tracts, and polyalanine-frameshifted proteins may
enhance polyglutamine-associated toxicity, possibly contributing to
pathogenesis. Anisomycin, a ribosome-interacting drug that reduces -1
frameshifting, also reduced toxicity, suggesting a therapeutic
opportunity for these disorders.

Haacke et al. (2006) found that full-length recombinant human AT3 formed
detergent-resistant fibrillar aggregates in vitro with extremely low
efficiency, even when it contained a pathogenic polyQ tract of 71
residues (AT3Q71). However, an N-terminally truncated form, called
257cQ71, which began with residue 257 and contained only the C terminus
with an expanded polyQ region, readily formed detergent-insoluble
aggregates and recruited full-length nonpathogenic AT3Q22 into the
aggregates. The efficiency of recruitment increased with expansion of
the polyQ stretch. FRET analysis revealed that the interaction of AT3Q22
with the polyQ tract of 257cQ71 caused a conformational change that
affected the active-site cysteine within the Josephin domain of AT3Q22.
Similar results were found in vivo with transfected mouse neuroblastoma
cells: 257cQ71 formed inclusions in almost all cells, and full-length
AT3 proteins did not readily aggregate unless coexpressed with 257cQ71.
AT3Q71 also formed inclusions, but it appeared to do so following its
partial degradation. Use of an engineered protease-sensitive form of AT3
suggested that release of expanded polyQ fragments initiates the
formation of cellular inclusions. Haacke et al. (2006) concluded that
recruitment of functional AT3 into aggregates by expanded
polyQ-containing fragments reduces cellular AT3 content and thus impairs
its function.

- Suppression of Mutant ATXN3

In animal cell models, Miller et al. (2003) demonstrated that
allele-specific silencing of disease genes with small interfering RNA
(siRNA) could be achieved by targeting either a linked SNP or the
disease mutation directly. They determined that selective targeting of
the disease-causing CAG repeat in the ATXN3 gene was not possible and
then took advantage of an associated SNP to generate siRNA that
exclusively silenced the mutant ATXN3 allele while sparing expression of
the wildtype allele. Allele-specific suppression was accomplished with
all 3 siRNA delivery approaches in use at the time: in vitro-synthesized
duplexes and plasmid and viral expression of short hairpin RNA.

In vitro, Li et al. (2004) found that an siRNA targeted to a C/G
polymorphism immediately after the CAG repeat that is expanded in MJD
effectively suppressed expression of mutant ataxin-3 (79 repeats) by 96%
without significant effect on the wildtype protein. In addition, siRNA
decreased cell death by 63 to 76%.

- Susceptibility to Late-Onset Parkinson Disease

In a family of African descent in which 3 members presented with
phenotypic features reminiscent of typical Parkinson disease (168600),
Gwinn-Hardy et al. (2001) identified pathogenic expansions in the ATXN3
gene. Features suggestive of PD included bradykinesis, facial masking,
rigidity, postural instability, shuffling, asymmetric onset, dopamine
responsiveness, and lack of atypical features often associated with
SCA3. A fourth, mildly symptomatic patient also carried the repeat
expansion. The authors suggested that the low numbers of repeats in this
family (67-75; normal, 16-34) presenting with parkinsonism may be
associated with ethnic background and that evaluation for SCA3 should be
considered in similar cases.

EVOLUTION

By comparing wildtype haplotypes encompassing the ATXN3 CAG repeat in
431 chromosomes of European, Asian, and African origin, Martins et al.
(2006) concluded that the main mutation mechanism occurring in the
evolution of the polymorphic CAG repeat is a multistep process resulting
from gene conversion or DNA slippage, as opposed to a stepwise process.
The 4 most frequent haplotypes showed a bimodal CAG repeat length
frequency distribution, particularly in the European population, and
genetic distances among all the alleles from each population did not
reflect allele size differences.

ANIMAL MODEL

- Transgenic Rodent Models of Machado-Joseph Disease

Cemal et al. (2002) generated transgenic mice by introducing pathologic
ATXN3 alleles with polyglutamine tract lengths of 64, 67, 72, 76, and 84
repeats, as well as the wildtype with 15 repeats. The mice with expanded
alleles demonstrated a mild and slowly progressive cerebellar deficit,
manifesting as early as 4 weeks of age. As the disease progressed,
pelvic elevation became markedly flattened and was accompanied by
hypotonia and motor and sensory loss. Neuronal intranuclear inclusion
formation and cell loss was prominent in the pontine and dentate nuclei,
with variable cell loss in other regions of the cerebellum from 4 weeks
of age. Peripheral nerve demyelination and axonal loss was also detected
in symptomatic mice from 26 weeks of age. In contrast, transgenic mice
carrying the wildtype (CAG)15 allele of the ATXN3 locus appeared
completely normal at 20 months. Disease severity increased with the
level of expression of the expanded protein and the size of the repeat.

Boy et al. (2009) generated a conditional mouse model of SCA3.
Transgenic mice developed a progressive neurologic phenotype
characterized by neuronal dysfunction in the cerebellum, reduced
anxiety, hyperactivity, impaired performance on the rotarod test, and
lower body weight gain. When mutant ataxin-3 expression was turned off
in symptomatic mice in an early disease state, the transgenic mice were
indistinguishable from negative controls after 5 months of treatment.
Boy et al. (2009) concluded that reducing the production of pathogenic
ataxin-3 may be a promising approach to treat SCA3, provided that such
treatment is applied before irreversible damage has taken place and that
it is continued for a sufficiently long time.

Alves et al. (2010) both overexpressed and silenced wildtype ATX3 in the
rat model of MJD developed by Alves et al. (2008). They found that
overexpression of wildtype ATX3 did not protect against MJD pathology,
that knockdown of wildtype ATX3 did not aggravate MJD pathology, and
that non-allele-specific silencing of ataxin-3 strongly reduced
neuropathology.

- Transgenic Drosophila Models of Machado-Joseph Disease

Warrick et al. (2005) expressed normal and pathogenic forms of human
ATXN3 in Drosophila and found that the normal activity of ATXN3
mitigated polyQ-induced neurodegeneration. When both normal and
pathogenic proteins were expressed together throughout the nervous
system, flies lived longer and showed improved brain cortical structure
compared with flies expressing only the pathogenic protein. Normal ATXN3
reduced accumulation of pathogenic ATXN3 and of other polyQ disease
proteins. Mutations in the ubiquitin interaction motif or in the
ubiquitin protease domain of ATXN3 abrogated the protective effect.
Protection also required proteasome activity, indicating that the normal
function of ATXN3 requires the ubiquitin pathway of protein quality
control.

Jung and Bonini (2007) showed that a transgenic Drosophila model for
spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 recapitulated key features of human CAG
repeat instability, including large repeat changes and strong expansion
bias. Instability was dramatically enhanced by transcription and
modulated by nuclear excision repair and CREB-binding protein (600140),
a histone acetyltransferase whose decreased activity contributes to
polyglutamine disease. Pharmacologic treatment normalized
acetylation-suppressed instability. Thus, Jung and Bonini (2007)
concluded that toxic consequences of pathogenic polyglutamine protein
may include enhancing repeat instability.

Li et al. (2008) provided evidence of a pathogenic role for ATXN3 CAG
repeat RNA in polyQ toxicity. In a screen for modifiers of polyQ
degeneration induced by ATXN3 in a transgenic Drosophila model, the
authors isolated an upregulation allele of muscleblind (see MBNL1;
606516), a gene implicated in the RNA toxicity of CUG expansion
diseases. Upregulation of muscleblind enhanced ATXN3 toxicity. Altering
the ATXN3 repeat sequence to an interrupted CAACAG repeat within the
polyQ-encoding region resulted in dramatically mitigated toxicity in
flies. Expressing an untranslated CAG repeat of pathogenic length in
flies resulted neuronal degeneration. Li et al. (2008) concluded that
these studies reveal a role for RNA in polyQ toxicity, highlighting
common components in RNA-based and polyQ protein-based trinucleotide
repeat expansion diseases.

To gain insight into the significance of ataxin-3 cleavage, Jung et al.
(2009) developed a Drosophila SL2 cell-based model as well as transgenic
fly models of SCA3. Ataxin-3 protein cleavage was conserved in the fly
and may be caspase-dependent as reported previously. Comparison of flies
expressing either wildtype or caspase-site mutant proteins indicated
that ataxin-3 cleavage enhanced neuronal loss in vivo.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MACHADO-JOSEPH DISEASE
PARKINSON DISEASE, LATE-ONSET, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
ATXN3, (CAG)n EXPANSION

Machado-Joseph disease (109150), also known as spinocerebellar ataxia-3,
results from an expansion of a (CAG)n repeat in the ATXN3 gene. In
normal individuals, the gene contains between 13 and 36 CAG repeats,
whereas most patients with clinically diagnosed MJD and all of the
affected members of a family with clinical and pathologic MJD showed
expansion of the repeat number in the range of 68 to 79 copies
(Kawaguchi et al., 1994).

Susceptibility to Late-Onset Parkinson Disease

In a family of African descent in which 3 members presented with
phenotypic features reminiscent of typical Parkinson disease (168600),
Gwinn-Hardy et al. (2001) identified pathogenic expansions in the ATXN3
gene. Features suggestive of PD included bradykinesis, facial masking,
rigidity, postural instability, shuffling, asymmetric onset, dopamine
responsiveness, and lack of atypical features often associated with
SCA3. A fourth, mildly symptomatic patient also carried the repeat
expansion. The authors suggested that the low numbers of repeats in this
family (67-75; normal, 16-34) presenting with parkinsonism may be
associated with ethnic background and that evaluation for SCA3 should be
considered in similar cases.

600327	TITLE *600327 SYNAPTOTAGMIN 3; SYT3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Synaptotagmin-1 (SYT1; 185605), an integral membrane protein of synaptic
vesicles, is thought to be involved in calcium-dependent exocytosis of
synaptic vesicles. Mizuta et al. (1994) cloned a novel isoform of
synaptotagmin, designated synaptotagmin-3, from a rat brain cDNA library
and studied its tissue distribution. The protein contains 588 amino
acids having 40.5, 38.3, and 64.0% identity with rat synaptotagmin-1,
rat synaptotagmin-2 (SYT2; 600104), and a third synaptotagmin isoform of
the marine ray, respectively. The region of the 2 internal repeats
homologous to the regulatory domain of protein kinase C was highly
conserved among the 3 synaptotagmins. RNA blot studies demonstrated that
synaptotagmin-3 mRNA is expressed in brain, various endocrine tissues,
and hormone-secreting clonal cells. It appeared to be involved in
Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis of secretory vesicles in endocrine cells, as
well as in neurons.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro characterization of recombinant rat Syt3, Li et al. (1995)
determined that Syt3 showed Ca(2+)-dependent binding to phospholipids,
Ca(2+)-dependent binding to syntaxins (see 186590), and
Ca(2+)-independent binding to adaptor protein-2 (see 601026).

MAPPING

Using an interspecific backcross DNA panel, Jones et al. (1995)
demonstrated that the mouse Syt3 gene is located on mouse chromosome 7;
no recombinants were observed between Syt3 and the kallikrein gene
family (Kal) in 94 meioses. To map human SYT3, they probed a Southern
blot containing genomic DNAs from a somatic cell mapping panel and found
segregation with chromosome 19. Thus, SYT3 appears to be located in the
conserved linkage group on proximal mouse chromosome 7 and human
chromosome 19q that is known to include at least 28 genes (Holdener et
al., 1993). Kwon et al. (1995) likewise mapped Syt3 to mouse chromosome
7.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PLPLA2 is a triglyceride lipase (EC 3.1.1.3) that localizes to lipid
droplets and catalyzes the initial step in triglyceride hydrolysis
(Zimmermann et al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching for genes expressed exclusively in mouse adipose tissue,
Villena et al. (2004) cloned Pnpla2, which they designated desnutrin.
The deduced 486-amino acid protein contains a highly conserved 180-amino
acid N-terminal patatin domain with a glycine-rich region, an active
serine hydrolase motif, and an aspartate active site motif. By database
analysis, Villena et al. (2004) identified human PNPLA2, which shows 88%
amino acid homology to mouse desnutrin. Northern blot analysis detected
a 2.0-kb transcript expressed at high levels in mouse brown and white
adipose tissue and at intermediate levels in heart and testis. Very low
expression was detected in all other mouse tissues examined. Expression
of desnutrin was lower in gonadal fat deposits of genetically obese mice
compared with wildtype mice. Desnutrin mRNA was found only in mature
adipocytes and not in proliferating or confluent mouse preadipocytes.
Expression was rapidly increased in cells induced to differentiate.

GENE FUNCTION

Villena et al. (2004) found that desnutrin mRNA levels were regulated by
the nutritional status of mice, being transiently induced during
fasting. In vitro desnutrin gene expression was upregulated by
dexamethasone in a dose-dependent manner, but not by cAMP, suggesting
that glucocorticoids could mediate the increased desnutrin mRNA levels
observed during fasting.

Zimmermann et al. (2004) reported that an enzyme besides
hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; 151750) that they called 'adipose
triglyceride lipase (ATGL)' catalyzes the initial step in triglyceride
hydrolysis in mammalian adipose tissue. ATGL contains a 'patatin domain'
common to plant acyl-hydrolases. ATGL is highly expressed in adipose
tissue of mice and humans. It exhibits high substrate specificity for
triacylglycerol and is associated with lipid droplets. Inhibition of
ATGL markedly decreased total adipose acyl-hydrolase activity. Thus,
Zimmermann et al. (2004) concluded that ATGL and hormone-sensitive
lipase coordinately catabolize stored triglycerides in adipose tissue of
mammals.

Jenkins et al. (2004) found that purified recombinant PNPLA3 (609567),
PNPLA2, and GS2 (PNPLA4; 300102) expressed in insect cells showed
abundant triacylglycerol lipase activity. The recombinant enzymes also
showed acylglycerol transacylase activity by transferring the acyl donor
mono-olein to mono-olein or diolein acceptors to form diolein and
triolein, respectively.

Using a cell culture model and various biochemical approaches, Wang et
al. (2011) investigated the mechanisms by which perilipin-1 (PLIN1;
170290), PLIN2 (103195), and PLIN5 (613248) control lipolysis by ATGL
and its colipase, CGI58 (ABHD5; 604780). PLIN5 exerted a negative
regulatory role in lipid droplet hydrolysis by binding and inhibiting
ATGL activity at the lipid droplet surface under basal conditions. Even
after protein kinase A (PKA; see 188830) activation, release of fatty
acid was only modestly increased. In contrast, recruitment of CGI58,
followed by interaction with ATGL, increased lipolysis. Neither PLIN1
nor PLIN2 directly interacted with ATGL. Wang et al. (2011) proposed
that PLIN5 plays a critical role in oxidative tissues (e.g., heart and
skeletal muscle) to protect mitochondria from a rapid increase of fatty
acid during lipolysis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fischer et al. (2007) reported that the PNPLA2 gene comprises 9 coding
exons.

MAPPING

The Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PNPLA2 gene to
chromosome 11 (TMAP A009K14). Villena et al. (2004) mapped the mouse
Pnpla2 gene to chromosome 7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 patients with a neutral lipids storage disorder (NLSD) associated
with mild myopathy but not ichthyosis (NLSDM; 610717), Fischer et al.
(2007) detected mutations in the PNPLA2 gene. One individual was a
compound heterozygote for a 1-bp deletion (808delC; 609059.0001) and a
missense mutation (P195L; 609059.0002). The second was homozygous for a
1-bp deletion (847delC; 609059.0003). The third was homozygous for a
nonsense mutation (Q289X; 609059.0004). Fischer et al. (2007) considered
the PNPLA2 gene as a good candidate for mutations causing this disorder
because PNPLA2 is activated by ABHD5 (604780), mutations in which cause
another NLSD, that with ichthyosis (NLSDI), also called Chanarin-Dorfman
syndrome (CDS; 275630). Fischer et al. (2007) noted that the 808delC,
847delC, and Q289X mutations severely alter and delete the C-terminal
region of the protein, which includes the putative lipid-binding site.
They suggested that loss of the C-terminal region could explain the low
activity of the lipid droplet-associated lipase and the defect in
triglyceride catabolism, while the intact N-terminal region containing
the catalytic site may retain lipase activity, explaining the normal in
vitro lipase activity in whole lysate of fibroblasts.

Reilich et al. (2011) identified biallelic mutations in the PNPLA2 gene
(see, e.g., 609059.0002; 609059.0009-609059.0010) in 6 patients,
including 2 sibs, with NLSDM. Mutations in 5 of the patients resulted in
a lack of protein expression. The patients had adult onset of muscle
weakness affecting primarily the shoulder girdle but sometimes affecting
the lower limbs and distal muscles of the fingers and feet. Some
patients developed cardiac involvement later in the disease course. All
had increased serum creatine kinase, most had increased serum
triglycerides, and all had Jordans bodies on peripheral blood smear,
consistent with multisystem lipid accumulation. Other, more variable
features included diabetes, hepatic steatosis, and sensorineural hearing
loss. Activation of hormone-sensitive lipase by beta-adrenergic agents
such as clenbuterol appeared to bypass the enzymatic block in
PNPLA2-deficient patient cells in vitro, suggesting a possible
therapeutic approach.

In 3 unrelated Han Chinese patients with adult-onset neutral lipid
storage disease with myopathy, Lin et al. (2012) identified 4 different
mutations in the PNPLA2 gene (609059.0005-609059.0008). All mutations
occurred in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state.

ANIMAL MODEL

Das et al. (2011) showed that inhibition of lipolysis through genetic
ablation of Atgl or hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; 151750) ameliorated
certain features of cancer-associated cachexia. In wildtype C57BL/6
mice, the injection of Lewis lung carcinoma or B16 melanoma cells causes
tumor growth, loss of white adipose tissue, and a marked reduction of
gastrocnemius muscle. In contrast, Atgl-deficient mice with tumors
resisted increased white adipose tissue lipolysis, myocyte apoptosis,
and proteasomal muscle degradation and maintained normal adipose and
gastrocnemius muscle mass. Hsl-deficient mice with tumors were also
protected, although to a lesser degree. Das et al. (2011) concluded that
functional lipolysis is essential in the pathogenesis of
cancer-associated cachexia.

Haemmerle et al. (2011) found that Atgl knockout in mice resulted in
cardiac insufficiency and premature death. Cardiac dysfunction was
associated with excessive lipid and glycogen accumulation, disrupted
substrate oxidation and respiration in predominantly subsarcolemmal
mitochondria, reduced expression of Ppar-alpha (PPARA; 170998) and
Ppar-delta (PPARD; 600409) target genes, including genes directly
involved in fatty acid and glucose metabolism, and reduced expression of
Pgc1-alpha (PPARGC1A; 604517) and Pgc1-beta (PPARGC1B; 608886).
Atgl-null mice also showed defective expression of Ppar-alpha and
Ppar-delta target genes in liver, but decreased expression of Pgc1-alpha
and Pgc1-beta was specific to cardiac muscle. Conditional Atgl deletion
in heart and skeletal muscle only resulted in a cardiac phenotype
identical to that in Atgl -/- mice. Reexpression of an Atgl transgene in
hearts of Atgl -/- mice entirely rescued the lethal cardiac phenotype,
increased expression of Ppar-alpha and Ppar-delta target genes and
Pgc1-alpha and Pgc1-beta, restored the metabolic profile, and increased
life span to a level indistinguishable from wildtype. Treatment of Atgl
-/- mice with Ppar-alpha agonists, but not Ppar-delta agonists,
completely reversed all pathologic effects of Atgl deletion. Haemmerle
et al. (2011) concluded that ATGL is required for cardiac mitochondrial
function and activation of lipids as signaling molecules.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DEL, 808C

In a female from the Netherlands with neutral lipid storage disease with
myopathy (NLSDM; 610717), Fischer et al. (2007) detected compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the PNPLA2 gene. A 1-bp deletion in exon
7 (808delC) led to frameshift and a premature stop codon at amino acid
position 319. The other allele carried a missense mutation
(609059.0002).

.0002
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, PRO195LEU

The patient of Fischer et al. (2007) from the Netherlands with neutral
lipid storage disease with myopathy (NLSDM; 610717) carried a 584C-T
transition in exon 5 of the PNPLA2 gene that led to a pro195-to-leu
substitution (P195L). This mutation is localized on the border of the
N-terminal patatin domain in a region that is conserved in 5 proteins of
the PNPLA family and in homologous genes conserved in bilateral animals.
The other allele of the patient carried a 1-bp deletion (609059.0001).

Reilich et al. (2011) reported a 45-year-old woman from Newfoundland
with NLSDM and a homozygous P195L mutation in the PNPLA2 gene. She had
onset of slowly progressive myopathy in her twenties, followed by severe
congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy by her late thirties. She
also developed diabetes mellitus. The proximal muscles were more
severely affected. Her father died of dilated cardiomyopathy at age 57.
The proband also carried a homozygous G483R substitution in the PNPLA2
gene, which was of uncertain significance.

.0003
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DEL, 847C

In a French patient with neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy
(NLSDM; 610717), Fischer et al. (2007) detected homozygosity for a 1-bp
deletion in exon 7 of the PNPLA2 gene, 847delC, leading to frameshift
and a premature stop codon at amino acid position 319. This patient
developed diabetes at age 12 and died from cardiovascular complications
at age 34.

.0004
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, GLN289TER

In an Algerian patient with neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy
(NLSDM; 610717), Fischer et al. (2007) found homozygosity for an 865C-T
transition in exon 7 of the PNPLA2 gene that substituted a stop codon
for the glutamine at codon 289 (Q289X).

.0005
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, IVS6DS, T-C, +2

In a 44-year-old Han Chinese man with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Lin et
al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
PNPLA2 gene: a T-to-C transition in intron 6, and a 749A-C transversion
resulting in a gln250-to-pro (Q250P; 609059.0006) substitution. RT-PCR
of patient skeletal muscle detected only the Q250P mutant mRNA,
indicating that absence of the transcript results from the splice site
mutation. The Q250P mutation was not found in 50 controls.

.0006
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, GLN250PRO

See 609059.0005 and Lin et al. (2012).

.0007
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, IVS6DS, G-T, +1

In a 48-year-old Han Chinese woman with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Lin
et al. (2012) identified a homozygous G-to-T transversion in intron 6 of
the PNPLA2 gene. No PNPLA2 transcript was detected by RT-PCR analysis of
mRNA from skeletal muscle.

.0008
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DEL, 467C

In a 39-year-old Han Chinese man with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Lin et
al. (2012) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (467delC) in the PNPLA2
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination
(Pro156LeufsTer100).

.0009
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DUP, 613C

In 2 Turkish sibs with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Reilich et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1-bp duplication (c.613dupC) in exon 5 of the
PNPLA2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The
mutant transcript was predicted to undergo nonsense-mediated mRNA decay,
resulting in a lack of protein. Muscle weakness primarily affected the
proximal upper limbs, although both patients also had some distal
involvement, including of the lower limbs in 1. Serum creatine kinase
and triglycerides were increased. Both patients had hepatic steatosis,
but neither had cardiac involvement. Jordans bodies were present in
peripheral blood.

.0010
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DEL, 543C

In a British man with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Reilich et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (c.543delC) in exon 5 of the
PNPLA2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The
mutant transcript was predicted to undergo nonsense-mediated mRNA decay,
resulting in a lack of protein. At age 28 years, the patient developed
slowly progressive muscle weakness affecting the proximal upper and
lower limbs. At age 52 years, he had Gowers sign, distal muscle weakness
of the upper and lower extremities, and cardiac involvement. He also had
sensorineural hearing loss since childhood. Jordans bodies were present
in peripheral blood.

.0011
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 4-BP DUP, 475CTCC

In a 35-year-old Japanese woman with NLSDM (610717), Akiyama et al.
(2007) identified a homozygous 4-bp duplication (c.475_478dupCTCC) in
exon 4 of the PNPLA2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination in the patatin domain (Gln160ProfsTer19). The mutation was
not found in 100 control alleles or in 50 unrelated Japanese
individuals. She had delayed walking and slow running from childhood,
with severe upper and lower limb involvement as an adult. However, she
did not have cardiac involvement. Imaging showed fatty replacement of
multiple skeletal muscles, and skeletal muscle biopsy showed
accumulation of neutral lipid droplets.

609787	TITLE *609787 UBIQUITIN-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; UBAP1
;;UBAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening the expression patterns of ESTs located in a region at
9p22-p21 undergoing loss of heterozygosity in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(NPC), Yang et al. (1999) identified an EST that is downregulated in
NPC. Using the clone for this EST and 5-prime RACE, Qian et al. (2001)
identified the full-length cDNA sequence, which they designated UBAP1.
The deduced 502-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular mass of 55
kD and contains 2 putative tandem UBA domains at the C terminus, a
coiled-coil domain, 2 possible N-glycosylation sites, 5 PKC
phosphorylation sites, 7 casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, and 3
N-myristoylation sites. Qian et al. (2001) also identified mouse Ubap1.
The human and mouse proteins share 90% sequence identity. Northern blot
analysis of human tissues detected ubiquitous expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript, with highest expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and
liver. RT-PCR of mouse tissues also revealed ubiquitous expression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using RT-PCR and direct sequencing, Qian et al. (2001) screened the NPC
cell line HNE1 and 10 primary NPCs for mutations in the UBAP1 gene. They
found no sequence alterations.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Qian et al. (2001) mapped the UBAP1 gene to
chromosome 9p22-p21.

609168	TITLE *609168 SHUGOSHIN-LIKE 1; SGOL1
;;SGO; SGO1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kitajima et al. (2004) cloned yeast Sgo1 and Sgo2, and by database
analysis, they identified 2 similar human proteins, SGOL1 and SGOL2
(612425), which they referred to as Q9BVA8 and tripin, respectively. All
Sgo-like proteins contain an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a
C-terminal basic region.

By searching for sequences similar to Xenopus Sgo, Salic et al. (2004)
identified mouse and human SGOL1, which they called SGO. The human
protein shares significant similarity with mouse and frog Sgo at the N-
and C-terminal ends.

Wang et al. (2008) noted that full-length SGO1 contains 527 amino acids.
An SGO1 splice variant lacking exon 6 encodes a 292-amino acid isoform
designated sSGO1. Using fluorescence microscopy, Wang et al. (2008)
showed that full-length SGO1 localized to kinetochores during mitosis.
In contrast, sSGO1 localized to centrosomes at interphase and to spindle
poles at mitosis, but not to kinetochores.

GENE FUNCTION

Salic et al. (2004) determined that the N terminus of mouse Sgo bound
and stabilized microtubules. Following transfection in HeLa cells,
epitope-tagged mouse Sgo localized to kinetochores between the fibrous
corona and the underlying centromeric chromatin, around the inner or
outer kinetochore plate. Endogenous HeLa cell SGOL1 was degraded by both
CDC20 (603618)- and CDH1 (603619)-activated anaphase-promoting complex
(APC), resulting in loss of SGOL1 from kinetochores during the
metaphase-to-anaphase transition. SGOL1 depletion by RNA interference
(RNAi) caused mitotic arrest with loss of sister kinetochore cohesion.
Chromosomes and their centromeres did not align to form a metaphase
plate; instead they scattered throughout the cell. SGOL1 depletion also
destabilized kinetochore microtubules. Salic et al. (2004) concluded
that SGOL1 is required for mitotic progression and chromosome
segregation and provides a link between sister centromere cohesion and
microtubule interactions at kinetochores.

Tang et al. (2004) found that depletion of BUB1 (602452) and SGO1 in
HeLa cells by RNAi caused massive missegregation of sister chromatids
that originated at centromeres. Loss of chromatid cohesion in BUB1 and
SGO1 RNAi cells did not appear to require activation of separase (see
604143), but instead triggered mitotic arrest dependent on MAD2 (601467)
and Aurora B (604970). Tang et al. (2004) determined that BUB1 maintains
the steady-state level and centromeric localization of SGO1, and they
concluded that BUB1 protects centromeric cohesion in mitosis through
SGO1.

Riedel et al. (2006) showed in both fission and budding yeast that Sgo1
recruited to centromeres a specific form of protein phosphatase-2A
(PP2A; 176915). Its inactivation caused loss of centromeric cohesin (see
RAD21; 606462) at anaphase I and random segregation of sister
centromeres at the second meiotic division. Artificial recruitment of
PP2A to chromosome arms prevented Rec8 (608193) phosphorylation and
hindered resolution of chiasmata. Riedel et al. (2006) concluded that
their data were consistent with the notion that efficient cleavage of
Rec8 requires phosphorylation of cohesin and that this is blocked by
PP2A at meiosis I centromeres.

In mitotic cells, phosphorylation of cohesin promotes its dissociation
from chromosomes, but centromeric cohesin is protected from
phosphorylation until kinetochores are properly captured by the spindle
microtubules. Kitajima et al. (2006) found that a shugoshin complex made
up of SGO1, SGO2, and a specific subtype of PP2A containing the
regulatory B56 subunit (see 601643) was required for protection of
centromeric cohesin in HeLa cells. The shugoshin-PP2A complex protected
cohesin by reversing phosphorylation of the cohesin subunit SA2 (STAG2;
300826). Both SGO1 and SGO2 bound PP2A directly, although SGO1 appeared
to bind the regulatory subunit PP2A-B56, while SGO2 appeared to bind the
core subunit PP2A-A (see 605983). Knockdown studies showed that SGO2
tethered PP2A to the centromere, whereas SGO1 had the more important
role in centromere protection and appeared to facilitate PP2A function
at centromeres.

Brar et al. (2006) showed that phosphorylation of the cohesin subunit
REC8 contributes to stepwise cohesin removal. Their data further
implicated 2 other key regulators of meiotic chromosome segregation, the
cohesin protector SGO1 and meiotic recombination in bringing about the
stepwise loss of cohesins and thus the establishment of the meiotic
chromosome segregation pattern.

Wang et al. (2008) found that SGO1 depletion via RNA interference
induced formation of multiple centrosome-like structures in mitotic HeLa
cells due to separation of paired centrioles. Sgo1 +/- mouse embryonic
fibroblasts displayed split centrosomes. sSGO1 interacted with PLK1
(602098) in HeLa cells, and mutation of PLK1 phosphorylation sites in
sSGO1 (ser73 and thr146) resulted in mislocalization of sSGO1 from
mitotic spindle poles. Centriole splitting induced by SGO1 depletion or
expression of a dominant-negative mutant was suppressed by ectopic
expression of sSGO1 or by PLK1 knockdown. Wang et al. (2008) concluded
that sSGO1 plays an essential role in protecting centriole cohesion,
which is partly regulated by PLK1.

Yamagishi et al. (2008) showed that the requirement of heterochromatin
for mitotic chromosome segregation is largely replaced by forcibly
enriching cohesin at centromeres in fission yeast. However, this
enrichment of cohesin is not sufficient to replace the meiotic
requirement for heterochromatin. Yamagishi et al. (2008) found that the
heterochromatin protein Swi6 (whose human homolog is HP1, 604478)
associates directly with meiosis-specific shugoshin Sgo1, a protector of
cohesin at centromeres. A point mutation of Sgo1 (V243E), which
abolishes the interaction with Swi6, impairs the centromeric
localization and function of Sgo1. The forced centromeric localization
of Sgo1 restores proper meiotic chromosome segregation in swi6-delta
cells. Yamagishi et al. (2008) also showed that the direct link between
HP1 and shugoshin is conserved in human cells. Yamagishi et al. (2008)
suggested that the recruitment of shugoshin is the important primary
role for centromeric heterochromatin in ensuring eukaryotic chromosome
segregation.

Kawashima et al. (2010) demonstrated that BUB1 (602452) phosphorylates
the conserved ser121 of histone H2A in fission yeast S. pombe. The
h2a-SA mutant, in which all cellular H2A-S121 is replaced with alanine,
phenocopies the Bub1 kinase-dead mutant (bub1-KD) in losing the
centromeric localization of shugoshin proteins. Artificial tethering of
shugoshin to centromeres largely restores the h2a-SA or bub1-KD-related
chromatin instability defects, a function that is evolutionarily
conserved. Kawashima et al. (2010) concluded that Bub1 kinase creates a
mark for shugoshin localization and the correct partitioning of
chromosomes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2005) mapped the SGOL1 gene to chromosome 3p24.3 based on an
alignment of the SGOL1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF308299) with the
genomic sequence.
