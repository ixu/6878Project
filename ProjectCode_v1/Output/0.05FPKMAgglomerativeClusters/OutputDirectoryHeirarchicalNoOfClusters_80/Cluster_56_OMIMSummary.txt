;;MIDGESTATION AND KIDNEY; MK;;
NEURITE GROWTH-PROMOTING FACTOR 2, FORMERLY; NEGF2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Midkine is a retinoic acid-responsive, heparin-binding growth factor
expressed in various cell types during embryogenesis. It promotes
angiogenesis, cell growth, and cell migration. Midkine is also expressed
in several carcinomas, suggesting that it may play a role in
tumorigenesis, perhaps through its effects on angiogenesis (summary by
Reynolds et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using mouse Mk to screen a midgestation human embryonic kidney cDNA
library, followed by screening a placenta genomic library, Tsutsui et
al. (1991) cloned human MDK, which they called MK. The deduced 121-amino
acid protein has a signal sequence and shares 87% identity with mouse
Mk. Orthologs of MK were detected in rat, cow, and chicken. The chicken
ortholog, Rihb, is a retinoic acid-induced heparin-binding protein. MK
shares about 50% amino acid homology with the human heparin-binding
protein pleiotrophin (PTN; 162095), with highest conservation in the
central part of the molecule and complete conservation of cysteine
residues. Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of about 1 kb in
adult human kidney and PA1 human teratocarcinoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Reynolds et al. (2004) found that hypoxia induced midkine expression in
alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary vasculature in a strain of mice
sensitive to hypoxia. Hypoxia induced expression of both HIF1-alpha
(603348) and midkine in human placental adenocarcinoma, mouse fetal lung
mesenchyme, and human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell lines. HIF1-alpha
induced midkine expression via regulatory elements in the mouse midkine
promoter. Chronic expression of midkine during embryonic development in
transgenic mice resulted in pulmonary arterial remodeling and
muscularization, but only during the postnatal phase of lung
development. In fetal mouse lung mesenchymal cells and transgenic mice,
midkine upregulated expression of myocardin (MYOCD; 606127), a regulator
of smooth muscle cell differentiation.

Intraperitoneal adhesions between organs or between organs and
peritoneal walls occur in more than 90% of cases involving major
abdominal operations. Using a model of postoperative adhesions and
Mk-null mice, Inoh et al. (2004) showed that midkine was fundamentally
involved in the formation of intraperitoneal adhesions, at least partly
by promoting migration of macrophages and neutrophils to the omentum.

Hobo et al. (2009) found that 5/6 nephrectomy in mice, a model of
chronic kidney disease, induced expression of midkine in lung, leading
to elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; 106180) activity and
plasma angiotensin II (106150) levels and subsequent hypertension.
Exposure to midkine enhanced ACE expression in primary cultured human
lung microvascular endothelial cells. Oxidative stress may have
contributed to midkine expression, since 5/6 nephrectomy induced
expression of NADH/NADPH oxidase-1 (NOX1; 300225), Nox2 (CYBB; 300481),
and Nox4 (605261). Furthermore, an antioxidant reduced midkine
expression and plasma angiotensin II levels and ameliorated hypertension
in 5/6 nephrectomized mice.

GENE STRUCTURE

Uehara et al. (1992) determined that the MDK gene contains 4 exons. The
5-prime flanking region adjacent to the start site contains 5 GC boxes,
a steroid/thyroid hormone receptor-binding site, and an A/T-rich island,
but there is no obvious CAAT box. Further upstream there is a region
with high GC content. The mouse Mdk gene has a similar organization,
with conservation of exons and significant homology in the 5-prime
region adjacent to the start site. There are 3 additional regions of
homology between mouse and human MDK in the 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, Eddy et al. (1991) demonstrated that
the MDK gene segregates concordantly with chromosome 11 and, using cell
hybrids carrying translocations involving chromosome 11, they mapped the
gene regionally to 11p13-p11. Kaname et al. (1993) mapped the MDK gene
to human chromosome 11p11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Simon-Chazottes et al. (1992) mapped the mouse Mdk gene to chromosome 2,
using an interspecific backcross panel and microsatellite polymorphisms
as markers. O'Hara et al. (1995) used somatic cell hybrid analysis and
interspecific backcross analysis, respectively, to map human Mdk to
chromosome 11p13-p11 and mouse Mdk to a syntenic region of mouse
chromosome 2. They also mapped an Mdk pseudogene to mouse chromosome 11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using microarray analysis, Ezquerra et al. (2005) found that aortae of
Mk -/- mice showed elevated expression of renin (REN; 179820),
angiotensinogen (106150), angiotensin II receptor-1 (AGTR1; 106165), and
angiotensin II receptor-2 (AGTR2; 300034) and decreased expression of
Ace.

614553	TITLE *614553 N6 ADENINE-SPECIFIC DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1, PUTATIVE; N6AMT1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to yeast Mtq2, Ren et
al. (2011) identified human N6AMT1. N6AMT1 shares about 25% identity
with the arsenic methyltransferase AS3MT (611806), but it contains only
1 of 3 motifs conserved in AS3MT orthologs. Real-time quantitative PCR
detected N6AMT1 expression in all 48 human tissues examined. Highest
expression was in parathyroid and pituitary glands, followed by adrenal
gland and kidney, and lowest expression was in leukocytes and mammary
gland.

GENE FUNCTION

Using the normal human uroepithelium cell line UROtsa, Ren et al. (2011)
found that overexpression of N6AMT1 increased cellular resistance to
treatment with trivalent inorganic arsenic (iAs(3+)). N6AMT1
overexpression had a more pronounced effect following treatment with the
more toxic trivalent monomethylarsonic acid (MMA(3+)). Analysis of the
arsenic metabolic profile revealed no methylated metabolites following
iAs(3+) treatment, but higher content of MMA(5+) and appearance of
dimethylarsonic acid (DMA(5+)) following MMA(3+) treatment.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the N6AMT1 gene to chromosome 21q21.3 based on an
alignment of the N6AMT1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF139682) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

611980	TITLE *611980 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S17; MRPS17
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPS17 is 1 of more
than 70 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes that are encoded
by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human MRPS17. The deduced 130-amino acid MRPS17 protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 14.5 kD. Removal of a predicted 20-amino
acid N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal results in a mature
12.4-kD protein. Koc et al. (2001) identified MRPS17 orthologs in mouse,
Drosophila, C. elegans, yeast, and E. coli. Highest conservation is in
the N-terminal and central regions of MRPS17 orthologs. Mouse and human
MRPS17 share 84.2% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS
map, Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRPS17 gene to chromosome
7p11-q11.21. By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang and Gerstein (2003)
identified 9 MRPS17 pseudogenes scattered throughout the genome.

605865	TITLE *605865 TASTE RECEPTOR TYPE 1, MEMBER 3; TAS1R3
;;T1R3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The TAS1R3 gene encodes the human homolog of mouse Sac, a major
determinant of differences between sweet-sensitive and -insensitive
mouse strains in their responsiveness to sucrose, saccharine, and other
sweeteners (Max et al., 2001).

CLONING

The ability to taste the sweetness of carbohydrate-rich foodstuffs has a
critical role in the nutritional status of humans. Although several
components of bitter transduction pathways had been identified, the
receptors and other sweet transduction elements remained unknown at the
time of studies by Max et al. (2001). The Sac locus in mouse, mapped to
the distal end of chromosome 4 (Li et al., 2001), is the major
determinant of differences between sweet-sensitive and -insensitive
strains of mice in their responsiveness to saccharine, sucrose, and
other sweeteners (Fuller, 1974). To identify the human Sac locus, Max et
al. (2001) searched for candidate genes within a region of approximately
1 million basepairs of the sequenced human genome on 1p36.33 syntenous
(the adjective used by the authors) to the region containing Sac in
mouse. From this search, they identified a likely candidate: T1R3, a
previously unknown G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and the only GPCR
in this region. Mouse Tas1r3, encoding T1r3, maps to within 20,000
basepairs of the marker closest to Sac (Li et al., 2001) and, like human
TAS1R3, is expressed selectively in taste receptor cells. The human
TAS1R3 gene encodes a protein of 843 amino acids with 7 transmembrane
domains and an extracellular domain of 558 amino acids. The T1R3 protein
is most similar to T1R1 (TAS1R1; 606225) and T1R2 (TAS1R2; 606226), 2
other GPCRs expressed in taste cells (Hoon et al., 1999) that were
identified by Max et al. (2001) in the 1pter-1p33 region. Northern blot
analysis of mouse tissues detected expression of 3 transcripts: a 7.2-kb
mRNA in taste tissue that was not detected in control lingual tissue
devoid of taste buds; a 7.8-kb mRNA expressed at moderate levels in
testis and very low levels in brain; and a 6.7-kb mRNA expressed in very
low levels in thymus.

By in situ hybridization, Liao and Schultz (2003) found that all 3 T1R
genes were expressed selectively in human taste receptor cells in the
fungiform papillae, consistent with their role in taste perception.

Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) stated that the deduced TAS1R3 protein
contains 852 amino acids. The deduced mouse protein contains 858 amino
acids. Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) also identified the fish TAS1R3
ortholog.

GENE STRUCTURE

Max et al. (2001) predicted that the human TAS1R3 gene spans 4 kb and
contains 7 exons.

Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) determined that the TAS1R3 gene contains 8
exons.

MAPPING

Max et al. (2001) determined that the human TAS1R3 gene is located about
20 kb from the pseudouridine synthase-like gene and adjacent to DVL1
(601365) on 1p36.33. The mouse Tas1r3 gene maps to distal chromosome 4.

By searching the human genome database, Liao and Schultz (2003) found
that the T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3 genes are all located within a small
region of chromosome 1p36.

GENE FUNCTION

Nelson et al. (2001) characterized the mammalian sweet taste receptors
T1r1, T1r2, and T1r3. Transgenic rescue experiments proved that the Sac
locus encodes T1r3. Human, rat, and mouse T1Rs are only 70% identical.
The authors presented a detailed analysis of the patterns of expression
of T1Rs and T2Rs (bitter taste receptors), thus providing a view of the
representation of sweet and bitter taste at the periphery. Nelson et al.
(2001) predicted a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 sweet receptor genes.

Nelson et al. (2002) identified and characterized a mammalian amino acid
taste receptor, T1R1+3, as a heteromer of the T1R1 and T1R3 G
protein-coupled receptors. Nelson et al. (2002) demonstrated that T1R1
and T1R3 combine to function as a broadly tuned L-amino acid sensor
responding to most of the 20 standard amino acids, but not to their
D-enantiomers or other compounds. They also demonstrated that sequence
differences in T1R receptors within and between species (human and
mouse) can significantly influence the selectivity and specificity of
taste responses. Most amino acids that are perceived as sweet (e.g.,
alanine, glutamine, serine, threonine, or glycine) activate T1R1+3. The
responses are strictly dependent on the combined presence of T1R1 and
TIR3. T1R1+3 is prominently expressed in fungiform taste buds, which are
innervated by chorda tympani fibers. Nelson et al. (2002) generated
heteromeric receptors consisting of human and rodent T1R subunits and
assayed for activation by amino acids and artificial sweeteners. The
presence of human T1R1 or T1R2 greatly altered the sensitivity of the
amino acid receptor and the specificity of the sweet receptor. Cells
expressing human T1R1 are more than an order of magnitude more sensitive
to glutamate than to other amino acids, and cells expressing human T1R2
robustly respond to aspartame, cyclamate, and intensely sweet proteins.

Xu et al. (2004) demonstrated the different functional roles of T1R
extracellular and transmembrane domains in ligand recognition and G
protein coupling. Similar to other G protein-coupled receptors of family
C, the N-terminal venus flytrap domain of T1R2 is required for
recognizing sweeteners, such as aspartame and neotame. The G protein
coupling requires the transmembrane domain of T1R2. Surprisingly, the
C-terminal transmembrane domain of T1R3 is required for recognizing
sweetener cyclamate and sweet taste inhibitor lactisole. Because T1R3 is
the common subunit of the sweet taste receptor and the umami taste
receptor, Xu et al. (2004) tested the interaction of lactisole and
cyclamate with the umami taste receptor. Lactisole inhibited the
activity of the human T1R1/T1R3 receptor and, as predicted, blocked the
umami taste of L-glutamate in human taste tests. Cyclamate did not
activate the T1R1/T1R3 receptor by itself, but potentiated the
receptor's response to L-glutamate. Taken together, these findings
demonstrated the different functional roles of T1R3 and T1R2 and the
presence of multiple ligand binding sites on the sweet taste receptor.

'Water tastes' are gustatory after-impressions elicited by water
following the removal of a chemical solution from the mouth, akin to
color after-images appearing on white paper after fixation on colored
images. Galindo-Cuspinera et al. (2006) demonstrated that a sweet
'water-taste' is elicited when sweet-taste inhibitors are rinsed away.
Responses of cultured cells expressing the human sweetener receptor
directly parallel the psychophysical responses: water rinses remove the
inhibitor from the heteromeric sweetener receptor TAS1R2-TAS1R3, which
activates cells and results in the perception of strong sweetness from
pure water. This 'rebound' activity occurs when equilibrium forces on
the 2-state allosteric sweet receptors result in their coordinated shift
to the activated state upon being released from inhibition by rinsing.

Jang et al. (2007) examined human duodenal biopsy specimens and found
expression of T1R2, T1R3, alpha-gustducin (GNAT3; 139395), and other
taste transduction elements in the enteroendocrine L cells. Mouse
intestinal cells also expressed alpha-gustducin, and ingestion of
glucose by Gnat3-null mice revealed deficiencies in secretion of
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1; see 138030) and the regulation of plasma
insulin (176730) and glucose. Isolated small bowel and intestinal villi
from Gnat3-null mice showed markedly defective GLP1 secretion in
response to glucose. In human NCI-H716 L cells, GLP1 release was
promoted by sugars and the artificial sweetener sucralose and blocked by
the sweet-receptor antagonist lactisole or siRNA for alpha-gustducin.
Jang et al. (2007) concluded that L cells of the gut 'taste' glucose
through the same mechanism used by taste cells of the tongue.

Margolskee et al. (2007) demonstrated that dietary sugar and artificial
sweeteners increased sodium-dependent glucose transporter isoform-1
(SGLT1; 182380) mRNA and protein expression and increased glucose
absorptive capacity in wildtype mice but not in knockout mice lacking
T1R3 or alpha-gustducin. In mouse GLUTag enteroendocrine cells,
sucralose increased release of GLP1 and GIP (137240), gut hormones
implicated in SGLT1 upregulation, and increased intracellular calcium;
inhibition of the T1R2-T1R3 sweet taste receptor by gurmarin blocked the
sucralose-stimulated release of GLP1 and GIP and the sucralose-dependent
mobilization of calcium in GLUTag cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By comparing the sequence of Tas1r3 from several independently derived
strains of mice, Max et al. (2001) identified a specific polymorphism,
I60T, that assorts between taster and nontaster strains. According to
models of its structure, T1r3 from nontasters is predicted to have an
extra N-terminal glycosylation site that, if used, would interfere with
dimerization.

In 144 unrelated individuals, consisting of 92 Europeans, 37 Asians, and
15 Africans, Fushan et al. (2009) genotyped SNPs from the TAS1R2 and
TAS1R3 genes and flanking regions, and found a significant association
between decreased sucrose taste perception and 2 SNPs in the promoter
region of the TAS1R3 gene: dbSNP rs307355 (-1572C-T) and dbSNP
rs35744813 (-1266C-T) (Bonferroni corrected p = 1.08 x 10(-4) and 2 x
10(-5), respectively). No SNPs at the TAS1R2 locus displayed significant
association with the phenotype. The dbSNP rs307355 and dbSNP rs35744813
SNPs together accounted for 16% of the observed trait variability and
appeared on the same haplotype block in all except 6 individuals.
Carriers of the C/T alleles at either SNP showed a 25% decrease in
sucrose sensitivity, and homozygotes for the T/T alleles were more
affected, showing a 50% decrease in their sucrose concentration-response
scores. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the T allele
of both SNPs resulted in significantly reduced luciferase transcription
in comparison to the C allele of both SNPs, although there was no
cumulative effect on transcription when both T alleles were present
simultaneously. When stratified by population, the C alleles were more
frequent outside of Africa, whereas the T alleles were most prevalent in
sub-Saharan African populations. Fushan et al. (2009) hypothesized that
individuals in colder geographic regions developed the ability to taste
sugars at lower concentrations, ensuring increased survival, and that
evolutionary pressure favoring high sweet sensitivity alleles in
nontropical geographic regions may have driven these alleles to high
frequency in these populations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Damak et al. (2003) generated T1r3 mice by targeted disruption. The T1r3
knockout mice were healthy and fertile with no obvious anatomic or
behavioral abnormalities. The gross anatomy of the taste tissue and
number of taste buds appeared normal in the T1r3-null mice. Knocking out
the T1r3 gene did not alter expression of T1r1 (606225) or T1r2
(606226). T1r3-null mice showed no preference for artificial sweeteners
and had diminished but not abolished behavioral and nerve responses to
sugars and umami (the taste of monosodium glutamate) compounds. Damak et
al. (2003) concluded that T1r3-independent sweet- and umami-responsive
receptors and/or pathways exist in taste cells.

Sweet and umami are the main attractive taste modalities in humans. T1Rs
are mammalian taste receptors that combine to assemble 2 heteromeric G
protein-coupled receptor complexes: T1R1+3, an umami sensor, and T1R2+3,
a sweet receptor. Zhao et al. (2003) reported the behavioral and
physiologic characterization of T1r1, T1r2, and T1r3 knockout mice. They
demonstrated that sweet and umami taste were strictly dependent on T1R
receptors and showed that selective elimination of T1R subunits
differentially abolished detection and perception of these 2 taste
modalities. To examine the basis of sweet tastant recognition and
coding, they engineered animals expressing either the human T1R2
receptor or a modified engineered opioid receptor, RASSL, in sweet
cells. Expression of T1R2 in mice generated animals with humanized sweet
taste preferences, while expression of RASSL drove strong attraction to
a synthetic opiate, demonstrating that sweet cells trigger dedicated
behavioral outputs, but their tastant selectivity is determined by the
nature of the receptors.

141850	TITLE *141850 HEMOGLOBIN--ALPHA LOCUS 2; HBA2
;;5-PRIME @ALPHA-GLOBIN GENE;;
ALPHA-GLOBIN LOCUS, SECOND;;
MAJOR ALPHA-GLOBIN LOCUS
DESCRIPTION Since at least as early as 1970, 2 alpha loci have been known to exist
in some humans (Brimhall et al., 1970): hemoglobins G (Pest) and J
(Buda) showed the existence of at least 2 alpha chains in the Hungarians
studied (141800.0041, 141850.0008), whereas hemoglobin J (Tongariki)
indicated that in Melanesians only 1 alpha locus exists (141800.0077).
The alpha locus is apparently double in Chinese (Kan, 1974), whereas in
American blacks, chromosomes with single or double alpha loci are about
equally frequent (Huisman, 1974). Rucknagel and Dublin (1974) estimated
that a chromosome with a single alpha locus has a frequency of about
0.27 in American blacks and about 0.36 in African blacks. Rucknagel and
Rising (1975) studied an American black family in which of 5 persons
heterozygous for hemoglobin G (Philadelphia), an alpha-chain mutant, 3
had about 30% Hb G and 2 had 40%. They suggested that the former persons
have 2 alpha hemoglobin loci and the latter persons 1 such locus. Three
members of a Hungarian family had 2 alpha-chain variants (Hb J Buda and
Hb G Pest), each variant accounting for 25% of hemoglobin, the rest
being Hb A (Brimhall et al., 1974). From studies of hemoglobin G
(Philadelphia), Baine et al. (1976) also concluded that there is
variability in the number of alpha-chain genes in the American black
population. In heterozygotes the proportion of Hb G (Philadelphia) was
trimodally distributed with modes at about 20%, 30%, and 40%. The
workers concluded that gene dosage accounts for this: 1 G gene out of 4
alpha genes leads to 20% Hb G; 1 G gene out of 3 alpha genes leads to
30% Hb G; 1 G gene out of 2 alpha genes or 2 G genes out of 4 alpha
genes leads to 40% Hb G. In Melanesians, Eng et al. (1974) observed
homozygous Hb Constant Spring and Hb A. The products of the 2
alpha-chain genes appear to have the same primary structure. Although
there is no direct proof, they are probably closely linked
(Politis-Tsegos et al., 1976). Unequal crossingover may be responsible
for the type of alpha-thalassemia with deleted alpha loci. From study of
Hb J(Mexico) in an Algerian family, Trabuchet et al. (1977) also
concluded that the alpha gene was duplicate in some chromosomes and
single in others. Two types of deletional alpha-plus-thalassemia are
identified by molecular genetic studies. One, termed leftward, shows a
deletion of 4.2 kb and removes the entire alpha-2 gene; the other,
termed rightward, has a deletion of 3.7 kb and gives rise to a hybrid
alpha-2/alpha-1 gene. The 3.7-kb rightward deletion can also remove the
entire alpha-1 gene and is 'possibly the most common mutation known to
produce a genetic disorder' (Bowden et al., 1987). It is prevalent in
most tropical and subtropical populations that have been studied,
including African and American blacks, Mediterraneans, Southeast Asians,
and some Pacific Island populations. In contrast, the 4.2-kb deletion of
the alpha-2 gene is very rare in African blacks and Mediterraneans. The
leftward one was found only in Asian cases until the report of a case in
East Sicily (Troungos et al., 1984).

El-Hazmi (1986) found several persons with the leftward deletion
alpha-thalassemia in Saudi Arabia, including homozygotes and
heterozygotes. Remarkably, in north coastal Papua New Guinea, the 4.2-kb
deletion is found in more than 80% of the population and appears to be
going to fixation (Oppenheimer et al., 1984). From comparison of the
level of hemoglobin Bart's at birth in homozygotes for each of the 2
deletions, Bowden et al. (1987) demonstrated that the alpha-2 gene, when
alone on the chromosome, reduces more alpha-globin than does the alpha-1
gene. (Since hemoglobin Bart's (142309) is a tetramer of gamma chains,
the level of this hemoglobin reflects in an inverse manner the amount of
alpha chains produced.) In a case of alpha-thalassemia, Whitelaw and
Proudfoot (1986) showed that the mutation in the 3-prime poly(A) site
leads to transcription of the mutant alpha-2 globin gene through into
the intergenic sequence past the normal termination site. They
interpreted these results as demonstrating that transcriptional
termination and 3-prime end processing of mRNA are coupled events for
the alpha-2 globin gene. Liebhaber et al. (1986) studied 8 separate
alpha-globin mutants mapped to the alpha-1 or the alpha-2 locus and
demonstrated that the alpha-2 gene encodes 2- to 3-fold more protein
than the alpha-1 gene. These results suggested that the human
alpha-globin cluster contains a major and a minor locus and that
deletions in the alpha-2 gene are more significant in the generation of
the alpha-thalassemia phenotype than are deletions in the alpha-1 gene.

N.B.: Alpha-globin variants for which it is unknown whether HBA1 or HBA2
is involved have been arbitrarily listed under HBA1 (141800).

Straub et al. (2012) reported a model for the regulation of nitric oxide
(NO) signaling by demonstrating that hemoglobin alpha, encoded by the
HBA1 (141800) and HBA2 genes, is expressed in human and mouse arterial
endothelial cells and enriched at the myoendothelial junction, where it
regulates the effects of NO on vascular reactivity. Notably, this
function is unique to hemoglobin alpha and is abrogated by its genetic
depletion. Mechanistically, endothelial hemoglobin alpha heme iron in
the Fe(3+) state permits NO signaling, and this signaling is shut off
when hemoglobin alpha is reduced to the Fe(2+) state by endothelial
cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3; 613213). Genetic and pharmacologic
inhibition of CYB5R3 increased NO bioactivity in small arteries. Straub
et al. (2012) concluded that their data revealed a mechanism by which
the regulation of the intracellular hemoglobin alpha oxidation state
controls nitric oxide synthase (NOS; see 163729) signaling in
nonerythroid cells. The authors suggested that this model may be
relevant to heme-containing globins in a broad range of NOS-containing
somatic cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HEMOGLOBIN CONSTANT SPRING
HEMOGLOBIN H DISEASE, NONDELETIONAL, INCLUDED
HBA2, TER142GLN

In this variant hemoglobin, named for the community in Jamaica where it
was first discovered (Clegg et al., 1971), alpha chains have 172 amino
acids rather than the normal 141. Clegg et al. (1971) suggested that
this may reflect a chain termination mutation. Hb Constant Spring
represents 1 to 2% of the hemoglobin of heterozygotes. When combined
with an alpha-thalassemia mutation, Hb H disease (613978) results. It is
the alpha-2 or 5-prime alpha-globin gene that is mutant in hemoglobin
Constant Spring. Hemoglobin Tak (141900.0279) is a termination defect of
the beta chain.

Hunt and Dayhoff (1972) searched 518 known protein sequences for a
31-amino acid sequence with the largest number of identities to that of
the extra piece on hemoglobin Constant Spring. The sequence that had the
greatest identity (9 amino acids) was the region 68-98 of the normal
alpha chain. See hemoglobin Wayne (141850.0004) for further discussion.

By use of allele-specific oligonucleotide probes, Kosasih et al. (1988)
demonstrated that Hb Constant Spring in a Batak Indonesian family was
due to replacement of T by C in the TAA terminal codon of the
alpha-2-globin gene, changing it to CAA, the codon for glutamine. This
resulted in read-through of the untranslated sequence of the mRNA.

Hsia et al. (1989) described a sensitive and specific DNA-based
screening test for improved detection of the Constant Spring variant
using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and allele-specific
oligonucleotide slot-blot hybridization. Since the Constant Spring
protein is difficult to detect by electrophoresis, Hsia et al. (1989)
suspected that the true incidence of the Constant Spring variant may be
greater than previously suspected on the basis of protein
electrophoresis.

Laig et al. (1990) found Hb CS gene frequencies between 0.05 and 0.06 in
northeastern Thailand. The Lao-speaking populations of the Mekong River
basin were found to have the highest frequencies of the gene in
Southeast Asia.

To identify nondeletion types of Hb H disease in Guangxi, China, Wen et
al. (1992) designed 3 primers: one specific for HBA1 DNA, another
specific for HBA2 DNA, and a third that was common to the 2. In 27 of 59
Hb H cases (45.8%), it was possible to confirm the disorder as
nondeletional in type. Of these, 22 (81.5%) had the Hb Constant Spring
mutation and one had the Hb Quong Sze mutation (141850.0005). The
nondeletion Hb H disease in Guangxi seemed to be more severe than the
deletion types.

.0002
HEMOGLOBIN ICARIA
HEMOGLOBIN H DISEASE, NONDELETIONAL, INCLUDED
HBA2, TER142LYS

Abnormally long alpha chain. Lysine is the 142nd amino acid. Glutamine
is the corresponding amino acid in the abnormally long alpha chain of Hb
Constant Spring (141850.0001), which like Hb Icaria is the result of a
terminator mutation (Clegg et al., 1974). The mutation is a TAA-to-AAA
change in codon 142 of the alpha-2 chain, converting it from 'stop' to
lysine. In a Yugoslavian teenager with moderate anemia with severe
microcytosis and hypochromia and 16% Hb H, Efremov et al. (1990)
identified the TAA-to-AAA mutation at codon 142 of the alpha-2 globin
gene. The patient also had an alpha-thalassemia-1 deletion of about 20.5
kb, common in Mediterranean populations. The one remaining alpha-1
globin gene was apparently able to compensate sufficiently for the loss
of the 3 alpha-globin genes to maintain a hemoglobin level of 8-9 g/dl.

The interaction of Hb Icaria with the Mediterranean type of alpha
thalassemia resulted in severe Hb H disease (613978); splenectomy
resulted in marked amelioration of clinical features (Kanavakis et al.,
1996).

.0003
HEMOGLOBIN KOYA DORA
HBA2, TER142SER

Excessive length of alpha-like chain (with at least 156 amino acids
rather than 141). De Jong et al. (1975) found that about 10% of members
of the Koya Dora tribe in Andhra Pradesh, India, carry this variant
hemoglobin. They found 2 persons with 2 alpha chain variants, Hb Rampa
and Hb Koya Dora, plus normal Hb A. This indicates that this population
carries 2 alpha chain loci. Hb Koya Dora resembles Hb Constant Spring
(141850.0001) in many respects including its alpha-thalassemia-like
expression. Serine is substituted at position 142 of the alpha-2 chain
(glutamine in Hb Constant Spring and lysine in Hb Icaria).

.0004
HEMOGLOBIN WAYNE
HBA2, LYS139ASN

Two hemoglobins, Hb W1 and Hb W2, with anomalous alpha chains were
observed in several members of a family. The alpha T-14 peptide was
replaced by a new peptide which was different in the 2. The sequence in
Hb A which was missing was thr-ser-lys-tyr-arg-COOH. In W1 it was
replaced by thr-ser-asn-thr-val-lys-leu-glu-pro-arg-COOH. Hb W2 had the
same peptide except that aspartic acid had been substituted for
asparagine in the third position. This was believed to represent the
result of enzymatic deamidation of Hb W1. This was the first reported
frameshift mutation in man. Deletion of a single nucleotide yields the
sequence observed in Hb W1. If the usual nucleotide sequence in the
alpha chain gene is ACX.UCX.AAA(G).UAC.CGU.UAA signifying
thr-ser-lys-tyr-arg-terminator, then hemoglobin Wayne has had a deletion
of the third nucleotide of codon 139 resulting in frameshift to
ACX.UCX.AAU.ACC.GUU.AAG.CUG.GAG etc., which reads
thr-ser-asn-thr-val-lys-leu-glu-etc. This interpretation agrees with
that for hemoglobin Constant Spring (141850.0001), which appears to be a
change in the first nucleotide of the terminator codon so that the above
sequence becomes ACX.UCX.AAA.UAC.CGU.CAA.GCU.GGA etc., which is read as
thr-ser-lys-tyr-arg-gln-ala-gly-etc. The mutation in Hb Wayne is in the
alpha-2 gene. See Seid-Akhavan et al. (1976) and Stamatoyannopoulos et
al. (1980). In a Canadian family of Scandinavian descent, Salkie et al.
(1992) described Hb Wayne in a mother and all of her 4 children.

.0005
HEMOGLOBIN QUONG SZE
HBA2, LEU125PRO

Goossens et al. (1982) described another nondeletion mechanism: mutation
in the 125th codon of the alpha-2 gene resulted in substitution of
proline for leucine in a region of the H helix of the alpha-globin
chain, which is critical for alpha-beta contact, resulting in impediment
to alpha-beta dimer formation, the initial step in hemoglobin tetramer
assembly. Thus, the alpha-thalassemia phenotype results from a novel
posttranslational mechanism. Goossens et al. (1982) named the mutant
Quong Sze, after the province in China where the mother of their proband
was born. Liang et al. (1991) reported a second example of this mutation
in a Chinese family in Guangxi (Quong Sze). Hb Quong Sze is a highly
unstable alpha-chain variant; because the abnormal alpha chains are
rapidly catabolized, the abnormal hemoglobin is difficult to detect in
reticulocytes. Identification was made through gene analysis.

.0006
HEMOGLOBIN EVANS
HBA2, VAL62MET

In the alpha-2 chain of hemoglobin from a Caucasian female with mild
hemolytic anemia, Wilson et al. (1989) demonstrated substitution of
methionine for valine at position 62. Dot-blot analysis of amplified DNA
using synthetic oligonucleotide probes confirmed the suspected G-to-A
mutation in the first position of codon 62; GTG was changed to ATG.

.0007
HEMOGLOBIN SUAN-DOK
HBA2, LEU109ARG

See Sanguansermsri et al. (1979). Hb Suan-Dok has an
alpha-thalassemia-like effect due to low production and instability of
the altered alpha-globin chain. Since the mutation (CTG to CGG) creates
a new SmaI restriction site, Hundrieser et al. (1990) diagnosed the
mutation by restriction analysis. Furthermore, they confirmed location
of the mutation in the HBA2 gene. The hemoglobin was identified in a
family from the province of Lampang in Northern Thailand. Weiss et al.
(1990) concluded that the thalassemia associated with the Suan-Dok
mutation results from instability of the mutant alpha-globin.

Regtuijt et al. (2004) described Hb Suan-Dok in a 58-year-old black
female from Curacao (West Indies) with persistent microcytic hypochromic
anemia.

.0008
HEMOGLOBIN J (BUDA)
ERYTHROCYTOSIS
HBA2, LYS61ASN

Hb J (Buda) and Hb G (Pest) (141800.0041), both alpha-chain mutants,
occurred together in a Hungarian male with erythrocytosis. The
occurrence of some normal Hb A in this man showed the existence of at
least 2 alpha loci. See Hollan et al. (1972) and Brimhall et al. (1974).
By selectively amplifying the alpha-1 and alpha-2-globin cDNAs and
hybridizing them to allele-specific oligonucleotides, Mamalaki et al.
(1990) demonstrated that the J-Buda variant has a change in the alpha-2
gene, namely, a change from AAG to AAC in codon 61.

.0009
HEMOGLOBIN SPANISH TOWN
HBA2, GLU27VAL

See Ahern et al. (1976). Cash et al. (1989) demonstrated that the
Spanish Town mutation is located in the HBA2 gene.

.0010
HEMOGLOBIN J (OXFORD)
HEMOGLOBIN I (INTERLAKEN);;
HEMOGLOBIN N (COSENZA)
HBA2, GLY15ASP

See Liddell et al. (1964), Marti et al. (1964), Silvestroni et al.
(1967), and Harano et al. (1984). This is a mutation of the HBA2 gene
(Cash et al., 1989).

.0011
HEMOGLOBIN I
HEMOGLOBIN I (BURLINGTON);;
HEMOGLOBIN I (PHILADELPHIA);;
HEMOGLOBIN I (SKAMANIA);;
HEMOGLOBIN I (TEXAS)
HBA2, LYS16GLU

The hemoglobin I mutation is curious in that it is encoded at both the
HBA1 locus (see 141800.0055) and at the HBA2 locus (Liebhaber et al.,
1984). This is presumably an example of gene conversion.

.0012
HEMOGLOBIN L (FERRARA)
HEMOGLOBIN HASHARON;;
HEMOGLOBIN SINAI;;
HEMOGLOBIN SEALY
HBA2, ASP47HIS

See Silvestroni et al. (1960, 1960), Bianco et al. (1963), Halbrecht et
al. (1967), Ostertag and Smith (1968), Charache et al. (1969), Nagel et
al. (1969), Lehmann and Vella (1974), Tentori (1977), and Pich et al.
(1978). The family in which hemoglobin Sealy was found was Ashkenazi
(Schneider et al., 1968). (Hemoglobin Beilinson was also found in an
Ashkenazi Jewish family and has a substitution of glycine for aspartic
acid at alpha 47.) See Benesch et al. (1982). This is a mutation of the
HBA2 gene (Cash et al., 1989).

.0013
HEMOGLOBIN MONTGOMERY
HEMOGLOBIN BIRMINGHAM (USA)
HBA2, LEU48ARG

See Brimhall et al. (1975), Huisman et al. (1980), and Mrad et al.
(1988). The designation of this hemoglobin was changed to Hb Montgomery
when it was discovered that Hb Birmingham had already been used for an
alpha variant hemoglobin from Birmingham, England (Hb J Birmingham)
(Schneider, 1974). This is a mutation of the HBA2 gene (Cash et al.,
1989).

.0014
HEMOGLOBIN G (BRISTOL)
HEMOGLOBIN D (BALTIMORE);;
HEMOGLOBIN D (ST. LOUIS);;
HEMOGLOBIN D (WASHINGTON);;
HEMOGLOBIN G (AZAKUOLI);;
HEMOGLOBIN G (KNOXVILLE);;
HEMOGLOBIN G (PHILADELPHIA);;
HEMOGLOBIN KNOXVILLE-1;;
HEMOGLOBIN STANLEYVILLE-I
HBA2, ASN68LYS

See Dherte et al. (1959), Atwater et al. (1960), Raper et al. (1960),
Baglioni and Ingram (1961), Gammack et al. (1961), Huehns and Shooter
(1961), McCurdy et al. (1961), Minnich et al. (1962), Weatherall et al.
(1962), Dance et al. (1964), Chernoff and Pettit (1965), Schroeder and
Jones (1965), Sancar et al. (1980), Surrey et al. (1980), Brudzdinski et
al. (1984), and Morle et al. (1984). This is a mutation of the HBA2 gene
(Cash et al., 1989).

.0015
HEMOGLOBIN INKSTER
HBA2, ASP85VAL

See Reed et al. (1974). This is a mutation of the HBA2 gene (Cash et
al., 1989).

Aguinaga et al. (2000) found the same hemoglobin variant in a nonsmoking
49-year-old Caucasian male who presented with polycythemia. The authors
stated that this was the first report of Hb Inkster associated with
polycythemia in a patient with an otherwise unexplained erythrocytosis.

(Polycythemia, erythrocytosis, and erythemia are synonyms meaning
increased red blood cell mass. Authors use the terms interchangeably,
although erythemia is now almost obsolete.)

.0016
HEMOGLOBIN COLUMBIA MISSOURI
HBA2, ALA88VAL

In a 22-year-old white man who was undergoing assessment for
erythrocytosis, Perry et al. (1991) found a hemoglobin variant resulting
from substitution of valine for alanine-88 in the alpha-2 chain.

.0017
HEMOGLOBIN SUN PRAIRIE
HBA2, ALA130PRO

Harkness et al. (1990) and Plaseska et al. (1990) identified this
variant hemoglobin in an Asiatic Indian child and an Asiatic Indian
adult, respectively. The child was apparently homozygous for a G-to-C
mutation in codon 130 of the alpha-2-globin gene resulting in marked
microcytosis and hypochromia. The patient reported by Plaseska et al.
(1990) was heterozygous. The change at codon 130 was GCT-to-CCT.

Ho et al. (1996) found Hb Sun Prairie in an Asian-Indian family in which
2 daughters were homozygous for this unstable alpha-2-globin variant.
They showed chronic hemolysis, whereas the heterozygous parents were
asymptomatic with a thalassemia carrier phenotype, distinct from the
chronic hemolytic state previously described in a heterozygote. Unlike
the earlier cases in which family studies were not available, this
family clearly exhibited autosomal recessive inheritance, unusual among
variants within the same region of helix H. Globin chain biosynthesis
ratios initially suggested a beta-thalassemic hemoglobinopathy; this was
excluded by normal sequence analysis of both beta-globin genes.

Sarkar et al. (2005) studied the effects of coinheritance of the Hb Sun
Prairie mutation with a point mutation in the 5-prime UTR on the same
HBA2 chromosome in both heterozygous and homozygous states in the
eastern Indian population. Depression of translation because of the
second mutation of a conserved base in the 5-prime UTR was thought to
account for clinical severity.

.0018
HEMOGLOBIN BOYLE HEIGHTS
HBA2, ASP6DEL

See Johnson et al. (1981, 1983). Hb Boyle Heights was originally
observed in an adult Mexican male. Zhao et al. (1990) observed it in a
Caucasian family living in South Carolina. They demonstrated that the
mutation is in the major alpha-globin gene, Hb A(2).

.0019
HEMOGLOBIN DAVENPORT
HBA2, ASN78HIS

Wilson et al. (1990) found a new, stable alpha-chain variant in 2
members of a Caucasian family living in Iowa. Hematologic data were
within normal limits. The hemoglobin moved between Hb A and Hb F in
isoelectric focusing (IEF) and eluted slightly faster than Hb A2 in
cation exchange HPLC. The family was of German descent. Replacement of
asparagine by histidine at position 78 was identified.

.0020
ALPHA-THALASSEMIA
HBA2, MET1THR

Pirastu et al. (1984) demonstrated that a nondeletion form of
alpha-thalassemia was due to an initiation codon mutation (AUG to ACG)
changing methionine to threonine.

Ayala et al. (1996) studied 10 Spanish families with nondeletional
alpha-thalassemia. In 9, they identified a 5-bp deletion at the donor
site of IVS1; in 1 case, they identified the ATG-to-ACG transition in
the initiation codon.

.0021
ALPHA-THALASSEMIA
HBA2, GLU116TER

In an American black woman with alpha-thalassemia, Liebhaber et al.
(1987) demonstrated a premature termination mutation at codon 116 (GAG
to UAG) changing a glu residue to 'stop.'

.0022
HEMOGLOBIN H DISEASE, NONDELETIONAL
HBA2, MET1VAL

In a family ascertained on the basis of hemoglobin H disease (613978),
Olivieri et al. (1987) found a new nondeletion form of alpha-thalassemia
mutation, an A-to-G substitution in the initiation codon of the HBA2
gene that changed methionine to valine. This mutation abolished an NcoI
restriction site and was therefore detectable in genomic DNA by Southern
blot analysis.

.0023
HEMOGLOBIN HANAMAKI
HBA2, LYS139GLU

In a 56-year-old Japanese female who by HPLC appeared to have an
abnormally high level of Hb A(1c), Orisaka et al. (1992) found a
lys139-to-glu mutation. The mother and 1 of 3 brothers also had the
abnormal hemoglobin. The mutation in Hb Tokoname (141800.0149) resides
in the same codon. The oxygen affinity properties of the 2 hemoglobins
are similar. A second case of Hb Hanamaki was described by Rahbar et al.
(1994) in an American family with erythrocytosis.

.0024
ALPHA-THALASSEMIA-2, NONDELETIONAL
HEMOGLOBIN H DISEASE, NONDELETIONAL, INCLUDED
HBA2, 3-UNT, A-G, +4

In a large family from southern Turkey, Yuregir et al. (1992) observed
nondeletional alpha-thalassemia-2 resulting from an A-to-G mutation at
nucleotide 4 in the polyadenylation signal of the HBA2 gene: AATAAA to
AATGAA. The same A-to-G replacement was present in the alpha-1
pseudogene. The mutation must cause a considerable alpha-chain
deficiency as evidenced by the hematologic data in 5 members of a family
with Hb H disease (613978) due to compound heterozygosity for
alpha-thalassemia-1 and the newly discovered poly(A) mutation.

.0025
HEMOGLOBIN KURDISTAN
HBA2, ASP47TYR

Giordano et al. (1994) reported a new alpha chain variant (Hb Kurdistan)
in a 15-year-old Kurdish refugee girl and her family from Amdea, Iraq.
Amplification and DNA analysis of both alpha genes indicated an
asp-to-tyr substitution (GAC-to-TAC) at position 47 of the HBA2 gene.
Replacement with the larger aromatic side chain of tyrosine at this
position does not induce any significant instability in the hemoglobin
molecule. In the proband's brother, this variant was associated with a
beta-thalassemia nonsense mutation at codon 39.

.0026
HEMOGLOBIN AGRINIO
HEMOGLOBIN H DISEASE, NONDELETIONAL, INCLUDED
HBA2, LEU29PRO

Hb Agrinio was discovered by Hall et al. (1993) in 3 individuals of
Greek origin with an atypical form of Hb H disease (613978)
characterized by a severe hypochromic, microcytic anemia. Hall et al.
(1993) indicated that the mutation consisted of a T-to-C transition in
codon 29 of the HBA2 gene causing a leucine-to-proline transition.
Although each affected individual was a compound heterozygote for Hb
Agrinio and a previously described mutation affecting the poly(A)
addition signal of the HBB gene (141900.0383), simple heterozygotes for
the leu29-to-pro mutation have the phenotype of the alpha-thalassemia
trait.

Traeger-Synodinos et al. (1998) reported the first case of homozygosity
for Hb Agrinio. The leu29-to-pro amino acid substitution in
alpha-2-globin was caused by a CTG-to-CCG transition. The 12-month-old
Greek proband presented with marked hypochromic microcytic anemia, a
very low level of Hb H, rare Hb H inclusions, and a balanced
alpha/non-alpha biosynthesis ratio. At the age of 13 years, the proband
had a clinical phenotype compatible with mild thalassemia intermedia
with moderate anemia (Hb = 7-8 g/dL), normal growth and development,
slight splenomegaly, and minimal bone changes, while Hb H and inclusion
bodies were not detected.

.0027
HEMOGLOBIN PAKSE
HEMOGLOBIN H DISEASE, NONDELETIONAL, INCLUDED
HBA2, TER142TYR

In a Laotian girl with hemoglobin H disease (613978), Waye et al. (1994)
found a TAA-to-TAT mutation converting the termination codon to a
tyrosine residue. The mutation gave rise to an elongated mRNA that would
code for an alpha-globin chain of 172 amino acid residues instead of the
normal 141 residues. The proband's father also carried the mutation. The
proband was a compound heterozygote for the Southeast Asian
alpha-thalassemia-1 deletion and the novel termination codon mutation.
Four previous mutations involving the termination codon of the
alpha-2-globin gene had been reported: Hb Constant Spring (141850.0001);
Hb Icaria (141850.0002); Hb Koya Dora (141850.0003); and Hb Seal Rock
(141850.0028).

.0028
HEMOGLOBIN SEAL ROCK
HBA2, TER142GLU

Hemoglobin Seal Rock carries a TAA-to-GAA mutation that converts the
termination codon of the HBA2 gene to glu (Bradley et al., 1975; Bunn
and Forget, 1986). Like 4 other mutations in the termination codon of
the HBA2 gene, the mutant allele codes for an alpha-chain variant of 172
amino acid residues that result in unstable elongated mRNA molecules.

.0029
HEMOGLOBIN ANAMOSA
HBA2, ALA111VAL

So-called 'silent' hemoglobin variants are characterized by the
replacement of an amino acid with one having a similar charge. These are
usually detected by separations in isoelectric focusing or HPLC because
of differences in hydrophobicity. The substitution occasionally may
affect the function of physicochemical properties of the variant to
determine the clinical or hematologic condition of its carrier. Kazanetz
et al. (1995) identified an ala111-to-val substitution in the core
peptide of HBA2 due to a change from GCC to GTC. The variant was
discovered in a Caucasian baby born in the Anamosa Community Hospital in
Anamosa, Iowa, and in his father. Stability tests on all red cell
lysates gave negative results, indicating stability of the variant
hemoglobin.

.0030
HEMOGLOBIN BIBBA
HBA2, LEU136PRO

In a large Caucasian family, Prchal et al. (1995) found that members
with congenital Heinz body hemolytic anemia were carriers of Hb Bibba.
Instability of the variant complicated isolation of the protein from
shipped blood samples. The mutation at codon 136 of the alpha-2 gene
resulted in a change from CTG to CCG and a leu136-to-pro substitution.
The first Hb Bibba heterozygote, characterized in 1968 by Kleihauer et
al. (1968), was believed to be a member of this family. The clinical
expression of the disease was surprisingly variable in severity.
Affected persons in 4 generations of the Alabama family had been
observed. (Please note that the mutation here is located in the HBA2
gene rather than in the HBA1 gene, as previously indicated in
141800.0011.)

.0031
HEMOGLOBIN SALLANCHES
HEMOGLOBIN H DISEASE, NONDELETIONAL, INCLUDED
HBA2, CYS104TYR

Morle et al. (1995) found homozygosity for a mutation in the HBA2 gene
resulting in hemolytic anemia associated with a low level of hemoglobin
H. The mutation was a TGC-to-TAC transition involving codon 104 and
resulting in replacement of a cysteine by tyrosine. In vitro and in vivo
biosynthetic studies suggested that the mechanism leading to Hb H
disease (613978) in this homozygous patient was related mostly to a
significant instability of the dimers between normal beta chains and
variant alpha chains.

Khan et al. (2000) identified Hb Sallanches in a Pakistani family having
3 homozygous patients with transfusion-dependent Hb H disease. The 2
previous reports had been of a French patient and a West Indian patient.
The Pakistani cases were thought to have originated as an independent
mutation.

.0032
ALPHA-THALASSEMIA TRAIT
HBA2, 9-BP DEL/8-BP INS

Efstratiadis et al. (1980) suggested that slipped strand mispairing
(SSM) is enhanced by short (2 to 8) direct repeats, which may induce
short deletions in mammalian DNA. SSM was later suggested to play an
important in the expansion of trinucleotide repeats, causing
neurodegenerative disorders such as spinocerebellar ataxia and
Huntington disease. In addition, the size variation of microsatellite
repeats, such as polymorphic markers, is also thought to result from
SSM. SSM probably also leads to the variability in microsatellite
repeats seen in tumor cells, reflecting the high degree of genomic
instability in those tissues. Thus, SSM appears to be occur both in
germline and in somatic cells. Slippage of the replication fork is not
in itself sufficient to explain the more complex mutations in which
small deletions are combined with insertions. Oron-Karni et al. (1997)
described a deletion/duplication mutation in the HBA2 gene that allowed
them to formulate a novel mechanism accounting for the generation of
this mutation, as well as a number of other human mutations. They found
a deletion of 9 bp (codons 39 to 41), which was replaced by a nucleotide
insertion, duplicating the adjacent downstream sequence. They proposed
that the mutation arose by SSM, creating a single-stranded loop,
followed by DNA elongation, strand breathing, and the formation of a
mismatch bubble. They found in the literature 6 additional
deletion/insertion mutations in humans in which the inserted nucleotides
came from the same DNA strand. Their model explained all 6 mutations,
suggesting that rearrangement of a mismatch loop or bubble during DNA
replication may be not uncommon. The patients in whom they made their
initial observations were 2 unrelated individuals of Yemenite-Jewish
origin, referred for evaluation of unexplained mild microcytic anemia.
The hematologic data were compatible with alpha-thalassemia trait.
Because of the rarity of the mutation and the fact that it had been
found only in the 2 individuals of Yemenite-Jewish origin, The subjects
may have had a common ancestor.

.0033
HEMOGLOBIN NATAL
HBA2, TYR140TER

See Jogessar et al. (1988). This variant resulted from a TAC
(tyr)-to-TAA (stop) transversion in codon 140 of the alpha-globin gene.

.0034
HEMOGLOBIN WATTS
HBA2, 3-BP DEL, ASP74DEL OR ASP75DEL

Rahbar et al. (1997) described the first example of a trinucleotide
deletion in the HBA2 gene. In a Mexican-American family, they found that
a slightly unstable alpha-chain hemoglobin variant was due to deletion
of an aspartic acid residue through the deletion of GAC at codon 74 or
codon 75 of the HBA2 gene.

.0035
HEMOGLOBIN CONAKRY
HBA2, LEU80VAL

Cohen-Solal et al. (1998) studied a Guinean woman who was heterozygous
for hemoglobin S and had episodes of marked anemia, repeated typical
metaphyseal painful crises, and hemosiderosis. Her sickling syndrome
resulted from the association of Hb S trait with a severe pyruvate
kinase (PK) deficiency (266200) leading to a 2,3-diphosphoglycerate
(DPG) concentration of twice normal. Sequencing of the PKLR gene
revealed a previously undescribed mutation within exon 5: a 2670C-A
transversion, leading to a ser130-to-tyr amino acid substitution
(609712.0010), which the authors referred to as 'PK Conakry.' In
addition, the patient carried a new hemoglobin variant, leu80 to val,
referred to as 'Hb Conakry,' which seemed to have a mild effect. The
high intraerythrocytic 2,3-DPG concentration induced by the PK
deficiency resulted in a decreased oxygen affinity which favored
sickling to a level almost similar to that of S/C compound heterozygous
patients.

.0036
HEMOGLOBIN J (SARDEGNA)
HBA2, HIS50ASP

See Tangheroni et al. (1968) and Manca and Masala (1989).

Paleari et al. (1999) provided molecular characterization of hemoglobin
J (Sardegna), which is particularly widespread in northern Sardinia.
They characterized the variant at the DNA level as a change of codon 50
of the HBA2 gene from CAC to AAC, predicting a his-to-asn substitution.
Protein analysis, however, showed a his-to-asp substitution in the same
position. A possible explanation for these findings is that a C-to-A
mutation caused the substitution of his for asn, and that the new asn
residue subsequently underwent a posttranslational partial deamidation
to asp. Indeed, Paleari et al. (1999) identified both the asp and the
asn forms of Hb J (Sardegna).

In addition to J (Sardegna), 6 other rare Hb variants had been reported
in which deamidation of an asn residue to an asp occurred as a
spontaneous posttranslational modification: Hb J (Singapore)
(141800.0075), Hb La Roche-sur-Yon (141900.0482), Hb Osler
(141900.0211), Hb Providence (141900.0227), Hb Redondo (141900.0404),
and Hb Wayne (141850.0004).

.0037
HEMOGLOBIN TARRANT
HBA2, ASP126ASN

Perea et al. (1999) provided the molecular characterization of a
hemoglobin variant in a Mexican family. Located in the HBA2 gene, an
asp126-to-asn amino acid substitution resulted in a variant with high
oxygen affinity. Previously described in 4 families with Mexican
ancestors, the variant was known as Hb Tarrant (Moo-Penn et al., 1977).

.0038
HEMOGLOBIN ANTANANARIVO
HBA2, VAL1GLY

During a systematic hematologic study, Kister et al. (1999) identified a
val1-to-gly mutation in the HBA2 gene in a 24-year-old woman who came
from Madagascar. The mutation is a clinically silent variant in which
the structural modification disturbs the oxygen-linked chloride binding.

.0039
HEMOGLOBIN BOGHE
HBA2, HIS58GLN

Lacan et al. (1999) found Hb Boghe in a 12-month-old girl who was
treated for malignant histiocytosis at 9 months of age and received a
bone marrow transplant from her sister. Hb Boghe was undetectable by
isoelectrofocusing and high performance liquid chromatography of
hemoglobins. It was only revealed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
of globin chains in the presence of urea-Triton X-100 and accounted for
10% of the total hemoglobin. The amino acid change resulted from a
CAC-to-CAA mutation in codon 58.

.0040
HEMOGLOBIN TOULON
HBA2, PRO77HIS

In 2 apparently unrelated diabetic women living in different parts of
France, Badens et al. (1999) found a hemoglobin variant during
chromatographic measurement of glycated Hb. Codon 77 of the HBA2 gene
was found to be changed from CCC (pro) to CAC (his).

Waye et al. (2000) reported a second instance of Hb Toulon in a Canadian
family of Italian descent.

Caruso et al. (2002) described what they referred to as the first
Italian case of Hb Toulon.

.0041
HEMOGLOBIN CAMPINAS
HBA2, ALA26VAL

Wenning et al. (2000) identified an electrophoretically silent
hemoglobin variant in a healthy 9-year-old Caucasian Brazilian boy and
his mother. The variant, which the authors called Hb Campinas, was a
single base substitution at codon 26 of the alpha-2 globin gene: GCG
(ala) to GTG (val).

.0042
HEMOGLOBIN NIKAIA
HBA2, HIS20ASP

Prehu et al. (2000) identified Hb Nikaia, a CAC-to-GAC change in the
HBA2 gene resulting in a his20-to-asp substitution, in a 50-year-old
French Caucasian man during measurement of glycated hemoglobin. The name
of the variant was derived from the ancient Greek name of the city of
Nice.

.0043
HEMOGLOBIN CLINICO-MADRID
HBA2, LYS90ARG

In a newborn in Madrid, Spain, Villegas et al. (2000) found an A-to-G
transition in exon 2 of the HBA2 gene, changing codon 90 from AAG (lys)
to AGG (arg).

.0044
HEMOGLOBIN CLINICO-MADRID
HEMOGLOBIN H DISEASE, NONDELETIONAL, INCLUDED
HBA2, IVS2AS, G-A, -1

In an Argentinian patient with Hb H disease (613978) and her daughter,
Noguera et al. (2001) found a splice acceptor consensus point mutation
changing AG to AA in intron 2. Their patient was of Arab and Italian
ancestry. The phenotypic expression observed in the heterozygote, namely
microcytic erythrocytes, slightly hypochromic, was rather more severe
than in individuals with a deleted gene. This observation was thought to
be in accord with the fact that the mutation affects HBA2, whose level
of expression is 3 times higher than that of the HBA1 gene.

.0045
HEMOGLOBIN DARTMOUTH
HBA2, LEU66PRO

McBride et al. (2001) reported a mutation in monozygotic twins and
designated it Hb Dartmouth, after the medical center at which the
patients were cared for. The mother, of Khmer ancestry, was heterozygous
for alpha-thalassemia-1 due to deletion of both HBA1 and HBA2, common in
Southeast Asians. The father, of Scottish-Irish ancestry, was a silent
carrier of a leu66-to-pro mutation of the HBA2 gene. The twins had
severe neonatal anemia requiring transfusion and were compound
heterozygotes for the 2 mutations.

.0046
HEMOGLOBIN GERLAND
HBA2, VAL55ALA

In studies of a 6-year-old boy with mild microcytic anemia, Lacan et al.
(2001) found a neutral alpha-chain variant involving the HBA2 gene and
designated it Hb Gerland. A GTT-to-GCT mutation of codon 55 was
predicted to result in a substitution of alanine for valine.

.0047
HEMOGLOBIN MANITOBA
HBA2, SER102ARG

Hb Manitoba (ser102 to arg) was discovered in a Canadian family by
Crookston et al. (1970) and was subsequently found in an Italian patient
by Sciarratta et al. (1984). Chang et al. (2001) observed the same
variant for the first time in an Asian family in Taiwan.

.0048
HEMOGLOBIN PARK RIDGE
HBA2, ASN9LYS

In an apparently well, 6-month-old Caucasian child, Hoyer et al. (2002)
found an AAC-to-AAG transversion in codon 9 of the HBA2 gene resulting
in an asn9-to-lys (N9K) change. Hb Delfzicht (141800.0208) has the same
mutation in the HBA1 gene.

.0049
HEMOGLOBIN NORTON
HBA2, HIS72ASP

In a 7-month-old Caucasian child who was apparently well and
hematologically normal, Hoyer et al. (2002) found a his72-to-asp
mutation in the alpha-2 chain. Three other alpha-chain variants had been
reported at this site with no apparent abnormality: Hb Gouda
(141800.0198), Hb Fuchu-I (141800.0196), and Hb Daneshgah-Tehran
(141800.0026). Hoyer et al. (2002) stated that 4 previously reported
beta chain variants with substitution of his77 in the beta-globin chain
likewise appeared to be without hematologic effect.

.0050
HEMOGLOBIN LOMBARD
HBA2, HIS103TYR

In a 34-year-old male of Italian (Calabrian) ancestry who was clinically
well and without hematologic abnormality, Hoyer et al. (2002) described
a CAC-to-TAC transition in codon 103 of the HBA2 gene, resulting in a
his103-to-tyr substitution. The same mutation had been reported in the
HBA1 gene as Hb Charolles (141800.0203) in a person of Sardinian origin,
who also had microcytosis that may have been due to mutation of the
3-prime polyadenylation site of the HBA2 gene.

.0051
HEMOGLOBIN SAN ANTONIO
HBA2, LEU113ARG

In a 1-year-old Caucasian male who was asymptomatic and hematologically
normal, Hoyer et al. (2002) found a CTC-to-CGC transversion in codon 113
of the HBA2 gene resulting in a leu113-to-arg (L113R) change.

.0052
HEMOGLOBIN RAMPA
HBA2, PRO95SER

Hb Rampa, a pro95-to-ser (P95S) change in the HBA2 gene, was first
described in a few members of the Koya Dora tribe of Andhra Pradesh,
India (De Jong et al., 1971). Additional cases were reported in a person
of north European origin (Smith et al., 1972) and a French-Canadian
family (Huisman et al., 1978). Hoyer et al. (2002) described Hb Rampa in
a 53-year-old asymptomatic male of German ancestry living in the United
States.

.0053
HEMOGLOBIN MANAWATU
HBA2, PRO37LEU

Brennan et al. (2002) described Hb Manawatu, a pro37-to-leu (P37L)
variant of the HBA2 gene, in a 28-year-old female of British descent
living in New Zealand who was heterozygous for a CCC-to-CTC transition.
The authors stated that the only other recorded mutation at position
alpha-37(C2) was Hb Bourmedes, a pro37-to-arg (P37R; 141800.0012) change
in the HBA1 gene.

.0054
HEMOGLOBIN G (HONOLULU)
HEMOGLOBIN G (HONG KONG);;
HEMOGLOBIN G (SINGAPORE);;
HEMOGLOBIN G (CHINESE)
HBA2, GLU30GLN

See Schneider and Jim (1961), Lehmann (1962), Swenson et al. (1962), and
Lie-Injo et al. (1979). The original Hb G (Chinese) variant was thought
to have a beta-chain substitution (Gammack et al., 1961).

Chang et al. (2002) observed this variant in a Taiwanese family and
found that it was caused by a G-to-C substitution at the first base of
codon 30 (GAG-to-CAG) of the HBA2 gene, resulting in the substitution of
a glutamic acid residue by glutamine (E30Q). The mutation created a PstI
restriction site and abolished an authentic BstNI site.

Shih et al. (2003) identified Hb G (Chinese) with alpha-thalassemia-1 of
the Thai type in a Taiwanese family.

.0055
HEMOGLOBIN PRATO
HBA2, ARG31SER

Marinucci et al. (1979) described this hemoglobin variant in a family of
Sicilian origin living in Prato (near Florence in northern Italy). De
Marco et al. (1992) found Hb Prato in a Calabrian family. The
replacement of the arginine residue by serine occurs at position 31
(arg31 to ser; R31S) of the alpha-2-globin chain. Shih et al. (2003)
observed this variant in a Taiwanese individual who was a compound
heterozygote for Hb Prato and alpha-thalassemia.

.0056
ALPHA-THALASSEMIA, DUTCH TYPE
HBA2, IVS1, A-G, -116

Harteveld et al. (1996) described an IVS1-116A-G acceptor splice site
mutation in the HBA2 gene, causing a very mild alpha(+)-thalassemia
phenotype, in 2 Dutch families.

Harteveld et al. (2003) reported a third independent case of this
alpha-thalassemia point mutation in a healthy 23-year-old Dutch woman;
this was the first case defining the phenotype in combination with a
frequent alpha(+)-thalassemia deletion defect.

.0057
ALPHA-THALASSEMIA, ZF TYPE
HBA2, METHYLATION SILENCING DUE TO ANTISENSE TRANSCRIPT

Barbour et al. (2000) reported an individual (called ZF) with
alpha-thalassemia due to a unique deletion (called alpha(-)-ZF) that
removed the HBA1 gene (141800) and the HBQ1 gene (142240) and juxtaposed
a region that normally lies approximately 18 kb downstream of the
alpha-globin cluster to a site next to the structurally normal HBA2
gene. The alpha(-)-ZF deletion did not remove any positive cis-acting
sequences, but expression of the structurally intact alpha-globin gene
was stably silenced and, during development, its CpG island became
densely methylated and insensitive to endonucleases over a region of
approximately 2 kb. Tufarelli et al. (2003) showed that the deletion had
truncated the widely expressed gene LUC7L (607782), which is transcribed
from the opposite DNA strand. They showed that in the affected
individual, in a transgenic model, and in differentiating embryonic stem
cells, transcription of antisense RNA mediated silencing and methylation
of the associated CpG island. This was identified as a novel mechanism
underlying human genetic disease.

.0058
HEMOGLOBIN CHARTRES
HBA2, PHE33SER

Prehu et al. (2003) found a new phe33-to-ser (F33S) variant (designated
Hb Chartres) in the HBA2 gene in a 31-year-old female of French origin
presenting with mild microcytic hypochromic anemia. No family studies
could be performed.

.0059
HEMOGLOBIN FUKUI
HBA2, LYS139ASN

Harano et al. (2003) found a lys139-to-asn (K139N) missense mutation,
resulting from an AAA-to-AAC transversion, in a 52-year-old Japanese
male. The change was in the same position 139 of the alpha-2 chain as
hemoglobin Tokoname (K139T; 141800.0149) and Hb Hanamaki (K139E;
141850.0023), 2 variants found in Japanese, both of which show high
oxygen affinity. Harano et al. (2003) found that the nucleotide sequence
of Hb Tokoname was ACA instead of AAA at codon 139 of the alpha-2-globin
gene. In the case of Hb Hanamaki, 9 of 12 Japanese families found
Honshu, the main island of Japan, were investigated, and the nucleotide
sequence GAA instead of AAA was identified at codon 139 of the
alpha-1-globin gene. However, in 1 family found in Kyushu, the western
most main island, the mutation was identified in the alpha-2-globin
gene. Thus, 3 different types of mutation at the same codon of the
alpha-globin gene were discovered in the same population and, moreover,
in the case of Hb Hanamaki, the nucleotide mutation was observed in both
the alpha-1- and the alpha-2-globin genes.

.0060
HEMOGLOBIN PART-DIEU
HBA2, ALA65THR

In a 58-year-old man of French Caucasian origin living in Lyon, France,
Lacan et al. (2004) identified an ala65-to-thr (A65T) mutation in the
HBA2 gene. The patient suffered from type II diabetes (125853) and had
hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, microlithiasis, hypercholesterolemia, and
hypertriglyceridemia.

.0061
HEMOGLOBIN DECINES-CHARPIEU
HBA2, ALA69THR

In a 34-year-old man of French Caucasian origin living in the city of
Decines-Charpieu in the south of France, Lacan et al. (2004) identified
an ala69-to-thr (A69T) mutation in the HBA2 gene.

.0062
HEMOGLOBIN VAL DE MARNE
HEMOGLOBIN FOOTSCRAY
HBA2, SER133ARG

Two different research teams, Wajcman et al. (1993) and Owen and Hendy
(1994), independently reported this hemoglobin variant, a ser133-to-arg
(S133R) substitution. Wajcman et al. (1993) discovered the mutation
(named Hb Val de Marne) in 2 French newborns who were first cousins.
Owen and Hendy (1994) found the hemoglobin variant (named Hb Footscray)
in a 27-year-old male of Polish-Hungarian descent. Position 133 is an
internal residue located near the heme pocket and the C-terminal end of
the alpha subunit. The mutation from serine to arginine at this position
may facilitate the access of oxygen, or water, to the heme iron. When
compared to adult hemoglobin (Hb A), the variant hemoglobin's oxygen
affinity is increased 1.7-fold and the autooxidation rate is slightly
increased.

Ma et al. (2004) demonstrated that the S133R mutation, caused by an
AGC-to-AGA transversion, is due to mutation in the HBA2 gene and not in
the HBA1 gene. They found the variant in a 15-year-old Chinese girl and
her father.

.0063
ALPHA-THALASSEMIA
HBA2, GLU23TER

Siala et al. (2004) described a 3-year-old Tunisian girl who had Hb
Bart's (gamma-4) at birth, later on presenting with moderate anemia,
microcytosis, and hypochromia; she had a normal HBA2 level and no
abnormal hemoglobin fraction. After excluding most of the common
Mediterranean mutations, sequencing of the HBA2 gene identified a
heterozygous change of codon 23 from GAG (glu) to TAG (ter) (glu23 to
ter). The E23X mutation was also found in the mother in heterozygous
state.

.0064
ALPHA-PLUS-THALASSEMIA
HBA2, GLY22GLY

In a 79-year-old woman of Surinamese-Hindustani origin with moderate
microcytic hypochromic anemia, Harteveld et al. (2004) identified a
silent mutation at codon 22 of the HBA2 gene, GGC (gly) to GGT (gly)
(gly22 to gly), resulting in a splice donor site consensus sequence
between codons 22 and 23. The abnormally spliced mRNA led to a premature
termination between codons 48 and 49. The presence of a downstream
intron was thought to induce the intracellular degradation of the
affected mRNA, through the pathway of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD),
thus explaining the alpha(+)-thalassemia phenotype of the patient. The
C-to-T transition was said to be the first reported mutation creating a
splice donor site in 1 of the alpha-globin genes.

.0065
HEMOGLOBIN ZURICH ALBISRIEDEN
ALPHA-PLUS-THALASSEMIA, INCLUDED
HBA2, GLY59ARG

In a patient presenting with persistent hypochromic microcytosis and
erythrocytosis, Dutly et al. (2004) identified a G-to-C transversion in
the HBA2 gene, resulting in a gly59-to-arg (G59R) substitution. The
defect, designated Hb Zurich Albisrieden, was not detected at the
protein level and led to alpha-plus-thalassemia.

.0066
HEMOGLOBIN PASSY
HBA2, SER81PRO

In a 3-month-old Turkish boy investigated for anemia with hypochromia
and microcytosis, Lacan et al. (2005) identified a TCC-to-CCC transition
in codon 81 of the HBA2 gene, resulting in substitution of proline for
serine (S81P).

.0067
HEMOGLOBIN PLASENCIA
HBA2, LEU125ARG

In a Spanish family residing in Plasencia with moderate microcytosis and
hypochromia, Martin et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for a
CTG-to-CGG transversion at codon 125 of the HBA2 gene, resulting in a
leu125-to-arg substitution.

.0068
HEMOGLOBIN KUROSAKI
HBA2, LYS7GLU

In the course of assaying glycosylated hemoglobin in a diabetic patient,
Harano et al. (1995) found a new alpha-chain variant, which they named
Hb Kurosaki after the city where the patient lived. Structural analysis
demonstrated substitution of glutamic acid for lysine at position 7.
From studies of a 30-year-old Thai male with normal hematologic profile
at the steady state, Ngiwsara et al. (2005) found the same hemoglobin
variant and demonstrated that the mutation was localized to the HBA2
gene and was caused by heterozygosity for an AAG-to-GAG transition in
codon 7.

.0069
HEMOGLOBIN H DISEASE, NONDELETIONAL
HBA2, 1-BP DEL, 2T

Viprakasit et al. (2005) stated that in Thailand at least 7,000 new
cases of Hb H disease (613978) are expected each year, because nearly
25% of the population is heterozygous for either deletional or
nondeletional alpha-thalassemia determinants. The clinical phenotypes of
affected individuals with Hb H disease are highly variable, ranging from
stillbirths in Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis to very mild clinical symptoms.
Viprakasit et al. (2005) described a rare initiation codon mutation of
the HBA2 gene, a 1-bp deletion of thymine at the second nucleotide of
the ATG initiation codon, in compound heterozygous state with
alpha-0-thalassemia. Other reported changes in the initiation codon of
HBA2 are met1 to thr (141850.0020) and met1 to val (141850.0022).

This mutation was described for the first time by Waye et al. (1997) in
an 8-year-old Canadian girl of Vietnamese descent. Pallor had been
evident since birth, and hypochromic microcytic anemia was first
documented at age 20 months.

.0070
HEMOGLOBIN AL-HAMMADI RIYADH
HBA2, ASP75VAL

During a routine hemoglobin analysis for anemia in a 16-month-old boy
who lived in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Burnichon et al. (2006) identified
heterozygosity for an A-T transversion in exon 2 of the HBA2 gene,
resulting in an asp75-to-val (D75V) substitution. The child had no
hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. This was the sixth hemoglobin variant
described at position 75 of the alpha-globin chain.

.0071
ALPHA-THALASSEMIA, HMONG TYPE
HBA2, 1-BP DEL, 1A

Eng et al. (2006) studied a newborn male of Hmong descent who had an
elevated level of Hb Bart's (more than 25%) indicative of Hb H disease.
Deletion-specific PCR demonstrated that he was heterozygous for the
Southeast Asian alpha-0-thal deletion. PCR amplification and direct
nucleotide sequence analysis of the intact alpha-globin gene cluster
revealed a 1-bp deletion of adenine from the translation initiation
codon (ATG) of the HBA2 gene.

.0072
HEMOGLOBIN H HYDROPS FETALIS SYNDROME
HBA2, 3-BP DEL, GLU30

In a patient with hemoglobin H hydrops fetalis (see 236750), Chan et al.
(1997) detected a deletion of codon 30 (deltaGAG, glu) in the hemoglobin
alpha-2 gene on one chromosome The other chromosome carried a large
deletion that removed both alpha-globin genes and the zeta-globin
(142310) gene. The mutant protein was apparently highly unstable since
there was no detectable radioactive or protein peak upon in vitro globin
chain synthesis. HbH was 2.5%, Hb Bart's 31%, HbF 28%, and HbA 38.5%. In
a review of the literature, Lorey et al. (2001) noted that this patient
died minutes after birth at 39 weeks' gestation, with ascites,
hepatomegaly, and placentomegaly present.

.0073
HEMOGLOBIN H HYDROPS FETALIS SYNDROME
HBA2, GLY59ASP

In a patient with hemoglobin H hydrops fetalis (see 236750), Chan et al.
(1997) detected a gly59-to-asp (G59D) substitution on one allele of the
HBA2 gene, resulting from a G-to-A transition. Both alpha-globin genes
on the other chromosome were removed by the Southeast Asian deletion
(Lorey et al., 2001). Fetal blood sampling at 28 weeks' gestation
revealed Hb Bart's of 39%, HbF 39%, and HbA 9%. An intrauterine
transfusion was given at 29 weeks, and the patient was delivered by
cesarean section at 34 weeks. The baby survived a turbulent neonatal
period and was discharged at 3 months of age. He required monthly
transfusions and at age 2 years had passed normal developmental
milestones. Chan et al. (1997) noted that this same mutation had been
reported in the HBA1 gene (Hb Adana; 141800.0174) and had been
coinherited with an alpha-thalassemia-1 deletion on the other allele,
resulting in hemoglobin H disease. Chan et al. (1997) suggested that the
more severe phenotype in their patient had resulted from the missense
mutation's occurrence in the HBA2 gene, which transcribes up to twice as
much mRNA as the HBA1 gene.

.0074
HEMOGLOBIN H HYDROPS FETALIS SYNDROME
HBA2, SER35PRO

In a patient of Filipino ancestry with hemoglobin H hydrops fetalis
syndrome (see 236750), Lorey et al. (2001) detected a ser35-to-pro
(S35P) substitution in the paternal allele of the HBA2 gene that had
resulted from a T-to-C transition. The maternal chromosome carried the
Filipino deletion removing the alpha-1 (141800), alpha-2, and
zeta-globin (142310) genes. Clinical manifestations at birth by cesarean
section at 34 weeks included pericardial effusion, fetal distress,
jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, ambiguous genitalia with fourth-degree
hypospadias, and bilateral inguinal testes. He required 6 transfusions
in the first 4 months of life; thereafter, hemoglobin levels stabilized.
At 13 months of age developmental milestones were consistent with an
estimated chronologic age of 10 months.

300384	TITLE *300384 EMERIN; EMD
;;STA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The EMD gene encodes a ubiquitous protein, emerin, that is found along
the nuclear rim of many cell types and is a member of the nuclear
lamina-associated protein family. Mutation in the EMD gene has been
found to cause the Emery-Dreifuss type of muscular dystrophy (EDMD;
310300).

CLONING

Bione et al. (1993) constructed a transcriptional map of the 2-Mb region
of Xq28 to which the Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy locus had been
mapped by linkage studies. Within this region, they identified the STA
gene. Bione et al. (1994) determined that STA (EMD) encodes a 254-amino
acid protein, termed emerin, which lacks a signal peptide, contains a
long N-terminal domain, and is hydrophilic except for a highly
hydrophobic 20-amino acid sequence at the C-terminal region. It has
several putative phosphorylation sites and 1 potential glycosylation
site. Northern blot analysis demonstrated ubiquitous expression of a
major, approximately 1-kb transcript, with highest expression in
skeletal muscle and heart and abundant expression in other tissues,
including colon, testis, ovary, and placenta. Bione et al. (1994)
suggested that emerin belongs to a class of tail-anchored membrane
proteins of the secretory pathway involved in vesicular transport.

Manilal et al. (1996) developed a panel of 12 monoclonal antibodies to a
large fragment of emerin cDNA prepared by PCR and expressed as a
recombinant protein in E. coli. These antibodies detected 4 different
epitopes on emerin. All monoclonal antibodies recognized a 34-kD protein
in all tissues tested. Immunofluorescence and cell fractionation studies
confirmed that emerin is located in the nuclear membrane. Amino acid
sequence similarities and cellular localization suggested that emerin is
a member of the nuclear lamina-associated protein family.

Small et al. (1997) isolated and characterized the complete mouse emerin
gene. The 2.9-kb mouse emerin gene comprises 6 exons and encodes a
protein 73% identical to that of the human protein. As in the human, the
gene encodes a serine-rich protein similar to lamina-associated
protein-2 (LAP2; 188380) and shows critical LAP2 phosphorylation sites.

GENE FUNCTION

Cartegni et al. (1997) reported that emerin localizes to the inner
nuclear membrane via its hydrophobic C-terminal domain, but that in
heart and cultured cardiomyocytes, it is also associated with the
intercalated discs. They proposed a general role for emerin in membrane
anchorage to the cytoskeleton. In the nuclear envelope, emerin plays a
ubiquitous and indispensable role in association of the nuclear membrane
with the lamina. In heart, it is specifically located to desmosomes and
fasciae adherentes. Desmosomes and fasciae adherentes anchor
desmin-containing intermediate filaments and the bundles of sarcomeric
myofilaments, respectively. They consist of transmembrane adhesive
glycoproteins, members of the cadherin superfamily, and of cytoplasmic
proteins such as vinculin (193065), catenins, and actin-binding
proteins. Different assortments of the same or similar proteins in
desmosomes, fasciae adherentes, focal adhesions, and other adhesive
junctions seem to confer specific functions to ensure cell-cell
communication and tight adhesion between cells and to the extracellular
matrix. The role of this complex assortment of proteins is best
demonstrated by the existence of many genetic diseases that perturb
adhesion and in the heart by the dramatic consequences of plakoglobin
(gamma-catenin) knockout (Ruiz et al., 1996): plakoglobin -/- mice die
at midgestation due to rupture of the ventricles. In heart, the specific
localization of emerin to desmosomes and fasciae adherentes could
account for the characteristic conduction defects described in patients
with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.

Yorifuji et al. (1997) likewise demonstrated that emerin is localized at
the inner nuclear membrane. Studies for ultrastructural localization of
the protein in human skeletal muscle and HeLa cells, using ultrathin
cryosections, showed that immune-labeled colloidal gold particles were
localized on the nucleoplasmic surface of the inner nuclear membrane,
but not on the nuclear pore. They interpreted their results as
indicating that emerin anchors at the inner nuclear membrane through the
hydrophobic stretch and protrudes from the hydrophilic region to the
nuclear plasm where it interacts with the nuclear lamina. They
speculated that emerin contributes to maintenance of the nuclear
structure and stability, as well as nuclear functions, particularly in
muscle tissues that have severe stress with rigorous
contraction-relaxation movements and calcium flux.

By mutation analysis, Lee et al. (2001) determined that several, but not
all, disease mutations in emerin map to a central lamin A (LMNA;
150330)-binding domain, and that mutations in this region disrupt
emerin-lamin A interaction. They also found that emerin binds directly
to BAF (BANF1; 603811), a DNA-bridging protein, and this binding
required conserved residues in the N-terminal LEM domain of emerin. The
disease-linked emerin proteins all remained active for BAF binding both
in vitro and in vivo.

Haraguchi et al. (2001) visualized colocalization between emerin and BAF
at the 'core' region of chromosomes during telophase in HeLa cells. An
emerin mutant defective in BAF binding in vitro failed to localize at
the core in vivo and subsequently failed to localize at the reformed
nuclear envelope. In HeLa cells expressing a BAF mutant that did not
show core localization, endogenous emerin failed to localize at the core
region during telophase and did not assemble into the nuclear envelope
during the subsequent interphase. This BAF mutant also dominantly
dislocalized LAP2-beta (188380) and lamin A from the nuclear envelope.
Haraguchi et al. (2001) concluded that BAF is required for the assembly
of emerin and A-type lamins at the reforming nuclear envelope during
telophase and may mediate their stability in the subsequent interphase.

Jacque and Stevenson (2006) examined susceptibility of primary
macrophages to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection following
short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of nuclear lamins and
several lamin-associated proteins. They found that silencing of emerin
and BAF prevented infection with HIV-1, but not murine leukemia virus,
by preventing integration of the virus into host DNA. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis identified emerin and BAF as cooperative
cofactors of HIV-1, and mutation analysis showed that viral cDNA did not
associate with BAF defective in emerin binding or with emerin lacking
the LEM domain. Jacque and Stevenson (2006) concluded that HIV-1 cDNA,
upon entering the nucleus, must interact with emerin to contact
chromatin, and they suggested that molecules that prevent this
interaction might promote abortive HIV-1 infection of a cell.

Ho et al. (2013) demonstrated that ectopic expression of emerin, which
is mislocalized in Lmna-null and Lmna(N195K/N195K) (see 150330.0007)
mutant cells, restored nuclear translocation of the mechanosensitive
transcription factor megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (MKL1; 606078) and
rescued actin dynamics. These data indicated that emerin is a crucial
modulator of actin polymerization and that loss of emerin from the
nuclear envelope causes disturbed actin dynamics and impaired MKL1
signaling. Ho et al. (2013) concluded that these and other findings
suggested a novel mechanism that could provide insight into the disease
etiology for the cardiac phenotype in many laminopathies, whereby lamin
A/C and emerin regulate gene expression through modulation of nuclear
and cytoskeletal actin polymerization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bione et al. (1995) reported the sequence of the EMD gene, which is
2,100 bp long. The gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

Bione et al. (1994) identified the EMD gene on a transcriptional map of
Xq28.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 5 patients with X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD1;
310300), Bione et al. (1994) identified mutations in the EMD gene
(300384.0001-300384.0005). These mutations resulted in the loss of all
or part of the protein.

Ellis et al. (1999) stated that more than 70 different mutations had
been identified in the emerin gene. They described 2 missense mutations
involving proline-183: P183H (300384.0008) and P183T (300384.0009).
Biochemical analyses had demonstrated that the mobility and expression
levels of the mutant forms of emerin are indistinguishable from those of
wildtype emerin, but that they have weakened interactions with nuclear
lamina components.

In a large consanguineous Algerian family segregating isolated atrial
cardiac conduction defects and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, Ben
Yaou et al. (2007) identified a deletion of lys37 (delK37) in the EMD
gene. Two men with EDMD were hemizygous for the mutation and homozygous
for an LMNA mutation (150330.0020). Three males who were hemizygous for
delK37 developed isolated atrial cardiac conduction defects in their
forties; 1 asymptomatic male carrier was 32 years old. Three of 5 women
heterozygous for delK37 also had cardiac disease. Ben Yaou et al. (2007)
stated that this was the first report of an EMD mutation giving rise to
isolated cardiac disease.

Brown et al. (2011) identified pathogenic mutations in the EMD gene in
23 (9.0%) of 255 North American patients referred for testing for EDMD.
There were 8 novel and 10 recurrent mutations. Most (90.5%) of the
mutations were predicted to result in a severely truncated or lack of
protein. Analysis of 130 EMD mutations indicated that exon 2 may be a
hotspot, perhaps owing to the high GC content.

ANIMAL MODEL

Frock et al. (2006) found that most cultured muscle cells from Lmna
knockout mice exhibited impaired differentiation kinetics and reduced
differentiation potential. Similarly, knockdown of Lmna or emerin
expression by RNA interference in normal muscle cells impaired
differentiation potential and reduced expression of muscle-specific
genes, Myod (159970) and desmin (125660). To determine whether impaired
myogenesis was linked to reduced Myod or desmin levels, Frock et al.
(2006) individually expressed these proteins in Lmna-null myoblasts and
found that both increased the differentiation potential of mutant
myoblasts. Frock et al. (2006) concluded that LMNA and emerin are
required for myogenic differentiation, at least in part, through an
effect on expression of critical myoblast proteins.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, X-LINKED
EMD, 2-BP DEL, NT564

Bione et al. (1994) described deletion of nucleotides 564 and 565 in the
EMD gene in affected members of a family with Emery-Dreifuss muscular
dystrophy (310300). This resulted in a frameshift and a stop codon after
amino acid 207.

.0002
EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, X-LINKED
EMD, MET1VAL

In affected members of a family with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
(310300), Bione et al. (1994) described an A-to-G transition at
nucleotide 59 of the EMD gene, abolishing the ATG methionine initiator
codon.

.0003
EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, X-LINKED
EMD, 29-BP DEL, NT113

In the affected members of a family with Emery-Dreifuss muscular
dystrophy (310300), Bione et al. (1994) found deletion of nucleotides
113 to 141 of the EMD gene, resulting in a frameshift and a stop codon
after amino acid 21.

.0004
EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, X-LINKED
EMD, 2-BP INS, NT198

In affected members of a family with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
(310300), Bione et al. (1994) found insertion of 2 basepairs after
nucleotide 198 of the EMD gene, resulting in a frameshift and a stop
codon after amino acid 64.

.0005
EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, X-LINKED
EMD, IVSAS, A-G, -3, 214-BP INS

In affected members of a family with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
(310300), Bione et al. (1994) found an A-to-G transition at the -3
position in a 3-prime splice junction of the EMD gene. The mutation was
first detected as an abnormality in the sequence of an RT-PCR product
which showed insertion of 214 bp at nucleotide 324. The nucleotide
sequence of the genomic fragments confirmed that the 214-bp insertion
was an unspliced intron. In the presence of the mutation, alternative
3-prime splice junctions were used at position -87 of the same intron
and position 365 in the next exon, giving 2 additional bands of size
intermediate between the normal and the band reflecting the 214-bp
insertion.

EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, X-LINKED
EMD, GLN43TER

Klauck et al. (1995) identified novel mutations in 3 families with
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (310300). One of these was a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 188, resulting in a change of codon 43 from CAG
(gln) to a stop codon.

.0007
EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, X-LINKED
EMD, 1-BP DEL, FS236TER

In a patient with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (310300), Yamada and
Kobayashi (1996) found that the emerin gene carried a 1-bp deletion of C
at nucleotide 672 or 673. This deletion caused a frameshift leading to
change in the amino acid sequence (amino acids 206-235) and generating
an early stop codon.

EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, X-LINKED
EMD, PRO183HIS

In a man with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (310300), Ellis et al.
(1999) identified a pro183-to-his mutation in the EMD gene, which they
called the STA gene. The patient was first referred to a neurologist at
age 31 because of back pain, weakness in the legs greater than the arms,
and leg numbness. As a child, he had been limited in his participation
in athletics in school. Upper limb weakness was noticed in childhood,
but no lower limb weakness was noted until age 25. He developed a
burning-quality low back pain at age 27 which radiated into the
posterior aspect of both legs. He had developed third-degree heart block
requiring a pacemaker. There were mild contractures of both ankles but
no elbow contractures.

EMD, PRO183THR

In a family with 4 brothers and a maternal cousin with Emery-Dreifuss
muscular dystrophy (310300), Ellis et al. (1999) identified a
pro183-to-thr mutation in the EMD gene, which they referred to as the
STA gene. Yates et al. (1999) identified the P183T mutation in a family
with an unusually mild EDMD phenotype and normal amounts of emerin.

602201	TITLE *602201 EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX PROTEIN 1; ECM1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mathieu et al. (1994) identified a novel 85-kD protein secreted by a
mouse osteogenic stromal cell line. Bhalerao et al. (1995) showed that
the full-length cDNA is 1.9 kb and contains an open reading frame of
1,677 bp that codes for a protein of 559 amino acids.

Smits et al. (1997) described a genomic clone containing the human
homolog, termed extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1), from a chromosome
1 cosmid library. The ECM1 gene appeared to be expressed as a 1.8-kb
transcript predominantly in placenta and heart, while an additional
1.4-kb alternatively spliced message was detected in tonsils. The
full-length human ECM1 transcript contains 1,838 bp and has an overall
homology of 79.6% with the mouse Ecm1 cDNA. The transcript codes for a
protein of 540 amino acids that is 69.4% identical and 81.3% similar to
the corresponding mouse protein. The alternatively spliced variant,
1,450 bp long, encodes a protein of 415 amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Smits et al. (1997) demonstrated that the coding region of the human
ECM1 gene comprises 10 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Oyama et al. (2003) noted that HLA-subtype susceptibility and high rates
of other autoimmune disorders suggest that autoantibodies to specific
mucocutaneous antigens may be involved in the etiology of lichen
sclerosis (151590). The clinicopathologic similarities between lichen
sclerosis and lipoid proteinosis, which results from mutations in ECM1,
suggested that this protein may be an autoantigen in lichen sclerosis.
By immunoblotting, IgG autoantibodies to ECM1 were found in 20 of 30
lichen sclerosis serum samples. The highest titer was 1 in 20. These
samples, and those from 56 other patients with lichen sclerosis, showed
immunoreactivity to the recombinant ECM1 protein; 6 of 85 control serum
samples were positive. The findings suggested that specific humeral
immune response to ECM1 may be involved in the etiology of lichen
sclerosis and may offer help in disease diagnosis, monitoring, and
approaches to treatment.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Smits et al. (1997) mapped the
ECM1 gene to 1q21 outside the epidermal differentiation complex region
(see 152445). Bhalerao et al. (1995) mapped the gene to mouse chromosome
3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lipoid proteinosis, also known as hyalinosis cutis et mucosae or
Urbach-Wiethe disease (247100), is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder
typified by generalized thickening of skin, mucosae, and certain
viscera. Classic features include beaded eyelid papules and laryngeal
infiltration leading to hoarseness. Histologically, there is widespread
deposition of hyaline (glycoprotein) material and
disruption/reduplication of basement membrane. Using DNA from 6
consanguineous families, Hamada et al. (2002) mapped the disorder to
chromosome 1q21 at marker D1S498 (lod = 21.85 at theta = 0), within a
2.3-cM critical region. Using a candidate gene approach, the authors
identified 6 different homozygous loss-of-function mutations in ECM1.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LIPOID PROTEINOSIS OF URBACH AND WIETHE
ECM1, 1-BP DEL, 1019A

In affected individuals of a consanguineous Kuwaiti family with lipoid
proteinosis (247100), Hamada et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for a
single-basepair deletion (A1019) in exon 7 of the ECM1 gene. The
mutation resulted in a premature stop codon 108 bp downstream.

.0002
LIPOID PROTEINOSIS OF URBACH AND WIETHE
ECM1, GLN346TER

Hamada et al. (2002) identified a 14-year old Pakistani boy with lipoid
proteinosis (247100); he was the product of a consanguineous mating, and
was homozygous for a C-to-T transition at position 1036 in exon 7 of the
ECM1 gene. The mutation resulted in conversion of codon gln346 to a
premature stop codon (Q346X).

.0003
LIPOID PROTEINOSIS OF URBACH AND WIETHE
ECM1, 1163-BP DEL

Hamada et al. (2002) reported 4 sibs affected with lipoid proteinosis
(247100) within a consanguineous Saudi family. All affected individuals
were homozygous for an 1163-bp deletion in the ECM1 gene, which
eliminated part of intron 8 and all of exons 9 and 10.

.0004
LIPOID PROTEINOSIS OF URBACH AND WIETHE
ECM1, 1-BP DEL, 507T

In 2 unrelated subjects with lipoid proteinosis (247100) with different
ECM1 haplotypes, Hamada et al. (2003) identified a 507delT mutation in
exon 6 of the ECM1 gene. The authors suggested that the deletion, which
causes a frameshift and premature termination 23 bp downstream, may
represent a recurrent mutation in lipoid proteinosis.

.0005
LIPOID PROTEINOSIS OF URBACH AND WIETHE
ECM1, ARG53TER

In a patient with lipoid proteinosis (247100), Hamada et al. (2003)
identified a homozygous arg53-to-ter (R53X) mutation in exon 3 of the
ECM1 gene.

.0006
LIPOID PROTEINOSIS OF URBACH AND WIETHE
ECM1, PHE167ILE

In a 2 year-old boy with lipoid proteinosis (247100) from a
nonconsanguineous family, Hamada et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous
phe167-to-ile (F167I) mutation in exon 6 of the ECM1 gene. He carried a
trp160-to-ter (W160X) mutation, also in exon 6, on the other allele.

613283	TITLE *613283 GLUTAREDOXIN, CYSTEINE-RICH, 1; GRXCR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Schraders et al. (2010) cloned human GRXCR1, which encoded a deduced
290-amino acid protein containing a putative glutaredoxin catalytic
domain and a cysteine-rich C-terminal region. The glutaredoxin domain is
predicted to function in the reversible S-glutathionylation of proteins.
Quantitative PCR detected high GRXCR1 expression in fetal cochlea,
moderate expression in adult testis, low expression in fetal heart and
adult duodenum and brain, and little to no expression in other adult and
fetal tissues examined.

Hunker et al. (2005) stated that the mouse Grxcr1 gene contains 290
amino acids. They found that transfected Grxcr1 was closely associated
with actin filament-like structures on the dorsal/apical surface of
cultured cells.

Odeh et al. (2010) found that 2 groups of 4 cysteines in the C-terminal
cysteine-rich domain of mouse Grxcr1 were predicted to fold into a zinc
finger configuration. They found that the central glutaredoxin-like
domain and cysteine-rich C terminus of GRXCR1 was highly conserved
between vertebrates. Grxcr1 was expressed in sensory epithelial of the
mouse inner ear and localized along the length of stereocilia of
auditory and vestibular hair cells in mouse cochlear explants. It also
localized along the length of actin filament-rich structures in
filopodia in monkey fibroblasts and in microvilli at the apical surface
of porcine kidney epithelial cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schraders et al. (2010) determined that the GRXCR1 gene contains 4
exons.

MAPPING

Schraders et al. (2010) mapped the GRXCR1 gene to chromosome 4p13. Odeh
et al. (2004) mapped the mouse pirouette (pi) locus, containing the
Grxcr1 gene, to a region of mouse chromosome 5 that shares syntenic
homology with human chromosome 4.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 sibs from a nonconsanguineous Dutch family, 1 sporadic Dutch
patient, and affected members of 2 consanguineous Pakistani families
with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB25; 613285)
mapping to 4p13, Schraders et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for 1
missense, 1 nonsense, and 2 splice site mutations in the GRXCR1 gene
(613283.0001-613283.0004, respectively) that cosegregated with disease
and were not found in 180 Dutch or 240 Pakistani controls.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pirouette (pi) is an autosomal recessive mutation that arose
spontaneously in the C3H inbred strain of mice. Pi/pi mice are fertile
and have a normal life span. They show circling, head-tossing behavior,
and hyperactivity, and develop profound hearing loss in the early
postnatal period. Sensory hair cells in the organ of Corti in pi/pi mice
show early degeneration, and beyond 1 month of age, pi/pi mice exhibit
degeneration of other cell types, including spinal ganglion and cells in
the stria vascularis. Odeh et al. (2004) found that pi and 2 additional
strains of mice with inner ear dysfunction, transgenic line 370
(pi-tg370) and Tasmanian devil (pi-tde), represent 3 independent allelic
mutations at the pi locus. Hunker et al. (2005) reported that pi is a
mutation of the mouse Grxcr1 gene.

Odeh et al. (2010) identified 2 additional mouse strains, nm2766 (pi-2j)
and nm3325 (pi-3j), that exhibit similar vestibular and auditory
deficits due to spontaneous recessive mutations in the Grxcr1 gene. Odeh
et al. (2010) showed that loss of Grxcr1 function in pirouette mice
resulted in abnormally thin and slightly shortened stereocilia.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 25
GRXCR1, IVS2, C-A, -9

In 3 affected sibs from a nonconsanguineous Dutch family with autosomal
recessive deafness-25 (613285), Schraders et al. (2010) identified
homozygosity for a splice site mutation (628-9C-A) in intron 2 of the
GRXCR1 gene, predicted to create a different splice acceptor site. The
mutation was not found in unaffected family members or in 180 Dutch
controls. Analysis of GRXCR1 cDNA from 2 of the affected sibs
demonstrated the presence of 7 additional base pairs between exons 2 and
3, leading to a frameshift and a premature stop codon.

GRXCR1, IVS2, A-T, +19

In a sporadic case of autosomal recessive deafness-25 (613285) in a
Dutch patient, Schraders et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a
splice site mutation (627+19A-T) in intron 2 of the GRXCR1 gene,
predicted to create an additional donor splice site. The mutation was
not found in unaffected family members or in 180 Dutch controls.

homozygosity for a 229C-T transition in the GRXCR1 gene, resulting in a
gln77-to-ter (Q77X) substitution. The mutation was not found in
unaffected family members or in 240 Pakistani controls.

resulting in an arg138-to-cys (R138C) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. The mutation was not found in unaffected family members or in
240 Pakistani controls.

603742	TITLE *603742 SLIT, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; SLIT1
;;SLIL1;;
MULTIPLE EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR-LIKE DOMAINS 4; MEGF4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the SLIT family, such as SLIT1, are secreted glycoproteins
that bind and activate ROBO receptors (see ROBO1; 602430) and function
in axon guidance during development (Xiao et al., 2011).

CLONING

In Drosophila embryogenesis, the 'slit' gene has been shown to play a
critical role in central nervous system midline formation. Itoh et al.
(1998) cloned SLIT1, a human homolog of the Drosophila 'slit' gene. They
also cloned 2 additional human 'slit' homologs, which they termed SLIT2
(603746) and SLIT3 (603745), as well as the rat homolog, Slit1. Each
SLIT gene encodes a putative secreted protein that contains conserved
protein-protein interaction domains, including leucine-rich repeats and
epidermal growth factor-like (see 131530) motifs, similar to those of
the Drosophila protein. The SLIT1 cDNA encodes a 1,534-amino acid
polypeptide with 43.5% similarity to the Drosophila 'slit' protein.
Northern blot analysis revealed that the human SLIT1 gene was expressed
as a major 8.4- and a minor 5.9-kb transcript primarily in the brain.
SLIT2 and SLIT3 mRNAs were primarily expressed in the spinal cord and
thyroid, respectively. In situ hybridization studies indicated that the
rat Slit1 mRNA was specifically expressed in the neurons of fetal and
adult forebrains. These data suggested that the SLIT genes form an
evolutionarily conserved group in vertebrates and invertebrates, and
that the mammalian SLIT proteins may participate in the formation and
maintenance of the nervous and endocrine systems by protein-protein
interactions.

GENE FUNCTION

Wu et al. (1999) reported that the secreted protein Slit repels neuronal
precursors migrating from the anterior subventricular zone in the
telencephalon to the olfactory bulb. They provided direct demonstration
of a molecular cue whose concentration gradient guides the direction of
migrating neurons. Both the Slit1 and Slit2 genes are expressed in the
murine postnatal septum and the neocortex. Wu et al. (1999) concluded
that their data support a common guidance mechanism for axon projection
and neuronal migration, and suggested that Slit may provide a molecular
tool with potential therapeutic applications in controlling and
directing cell migration.

Using cocultured explants of mouse embryonic retina, Plump et al. (2002)
found that Slit1, like Slit2, is a potent inhibitor of retinal axon
growth, inducing a similar decrease in the extent of outgrowth to that
seen in the presence of Slit2.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of radiation hybrid panels, Nakayama et al. (1998)
mapped the SLIT1 gene, which they referred to as the MEGF4 gene, to
chromosome 10q23.3-q24.

ANIMAL MODEL

To investigate the role of Slit proteins in retinal ganglion cell axon
guidance, Plump et al. (2002) used gene targeting to generate mice
deficient in either Slit1 or Slit2. The knockout mice exhibited few
retinal ganglion cell axon guidance defects and the authors concluded
that Slit1 and Slit2 deficiency alone does not cause significant defects
in axon guidance within the developing visual system. In contrast, they
demonstrated that Slit1/2 double mutants develop severe and persistent
axon guidance defects in the visual system. Using lipophilic dye tracing
and immunohistochemistry, they detected defects in the double knockout
mice including the formation of a second, ectopic optic chiasm; aberrant
growth of retinal axons into the contralateral optic nerve; and axon
wandering defects in the ventral diencephalon. Plump et al. (2002)
concluded that Slit1 and Slit2 play a critical role in channeling
retinal axons toward their appropriate midline crossing point, serving
as inhibitors for growth into inappropriate regions of the brain. The
authors hypothesized that the complementary domains of Slit1 and Slit2
expression surrounding the path of the ingrowing retinal axons establish
a corridor through which retinal axons can travel, resulting in the
correct positioning of the optic chiasm within the brain.

Using immunohistochemistry and axon tracing experiments, Bagri et al.
(2002) presented a detailed characterization of abnormal axonal
projections within the forebrain of Slit2 knockout and Slit1/2 double
knockout mice (Plump et al. (2002)). They provided in vivo evidence that
Slit proteins are regulators of guidance of corticofugal, callosal,
thalamocortical, serotonergic, and dopaminergic projections in the
embryonic forebrain. The authors concluded that Slit proteins in the
brain appear to contribute to the maintenance of dorsal position by
prevention of axonal growth into ventral regions, the prevention of
axonal extension toward and across the midline, and the channeling of
axons toward particular regions.

In the mouse ventral spinal cord, Hochstim et al. (2008) identified 3
subtypes of white matter astrocytes with differential gene expression
corresponding to position. Astrocytes expressing both Reln (600514) and
Slit1 were in the ventrolateral domain, those expressing Reln only were
at the dorsolateral domain, and those expressing Slit1 only were at the
ventromedial domain. The distinct positions of these astrocytes were
specified by varying expression of the homeodomain transcription factors
Pax6 (607108) and Nkx6.1 (602563). The findings indicated that
positional identity is an organizing principle underlying phenotypic
diversity among white matter astrocytes, as well as among neurons, and
that this diversity is prespecified within precursor cells in the
germinal zone of the CNS.

Using a zebrafish model, Xiao et al. (2011) showed that the type IV
collagen Col4a5 (303630) on the surface of the tectum basement membrane
bound Slit1 and guided retinal ganglion cell axons expressing Robo2.

TYW4;;
tRNA-YW-SYNTHESIZING PROTEIN 4, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF;;
KIAA0547
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Wybutosine (yW) is a hypermodified guanosine at the 3-prime position
adjacent to the anticodon of phenylalanine tRNA that stabilizes
codon-anticodon interactions during decoding on the ribosome. LCMT2 is
the human homolog of a yeast gene essential for yW synthesis (Noma and
Suzuki, 2006).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a brain cDNA library, Nagase et al.
(1998) cloned LCMT2, which they designated KIAA0547. The transcript
contains several repetitive elements in its 3-prime UTR, and the deduced
protein contains 686 amino acids. RT-PCR detected LCMT2 expression in
kidney only. In vitro-translated LCMT3 had an apparent molecular mass of
61 kD by SDS-PAGE.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the LCMT2 gene
to chromosome 4. However, Hartz (2013) mapped the LCMT2 gene to
chromosome 15q15.3 based on an alignment of the LCMT2 sequence (GenBank
GENBANK AF265443) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;BLOC1, SUBUNIT 2; BLOS2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BLOC1S2 is a component of the ubiquitously expressed BLOC1 multisubunit
protein complex. BLOC1 is required for normal biogenesis of specialized
organelles of the endosomal-lysosomal system, such as melanosomes and
platelet dense granules (Starcevic and Dell'Angelica, 2004).

CLONING

Using the BLOC1 subunit pallidin (PLDN; 604310) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Starcevic and Dell'Angelica
(2004) cloned BLOC1S2, which they called BLOS2. The deduced BLOS2
protein contains coiled-coil regions and has a calculated molecular mass
of 16 kD. Western blot analysis detected endogenous HeLa cell BLOS2 at
an apparent molecular mass of 18 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By mass spectrometry of BLOC1 proteins purified from bovine liver, mouse
liver, and HeLa cells, Starcevic and Dell'Angelica (2004) identified
BLOS2 as a subunit of BLOC1. Other BLOC1 subunits identified were
pallidin, muted (607289), dysbindin (DTNBP1; 607145), cappuccino
(605695), snapin (SNAPAP; 607007), BLOC1S1 (601444), and BLOC1S3
(609762). Coimmunoprecipitation and yeast 2-hybrid analyses confirmed
that these proteins interact within the BLOC1 complex.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the BLOC1S2
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP RH47426).

602705	TITLE *602705 SYNAPSIN III; SYN3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Synapsins are a family of neuron-specific synaptic vesicle-associated
phosphoproteins that have been implicated in synaptogenesis and in the
modulation of neurotransmitter release. In mammals, distinct genes for
synapsins I (SYN1; 313440) and II (SYN2; 600755) have been identified,
each of which encodes 2 alternatively spliced isoforms. Kao et al.
(1998) cloned and characterized a third member of the synapsin gene
family, synapsin III, from human DNA. Synapsin III gives rise to at
least 1 protein isoform, designated synapsin IIIa, in several mammalian
species. Synapsin IIIa is associated with synaptic vesicles, and its
expression appears to be neuron-specific. The primary structure of
synapsin IIIa conforms to the domain model previously described for the
synapsin family, with domains A, C, and E exhibiting the highest degree
of conservation. Synapsin IIIa contains a novel domain, termed domain J,
located between domains C and E. The similarities among synapsins I, II,
and III in domain organization, neuron-specific expression, and
subcellular localization suggested a possible role for synapsin III in
the regulation of neurotransmitter release and synaptogenesis.

Hosaka and Sudhof (1998) identified the human SYN3 gene. Among the rat
tissues tested, they found that Syn3 was expressed only in brain. As in
other synapsins, the C domain of Syn3 bound ATP with high affinity and
ADP with a lower affinity, consistent with a cycle of ATP binding and
hydrolysis. However, unlike with Syn1 and Syn2, calcium inhibited ATP
binding to Syn3. The authors concluded that calcium has distinct
regulatory effects on Syn1, Syn2, and Syn3.

MAPPING

Kao et al. (1998) found that an anonymous marker from 22q12-q13,
D22S280, was located within an intron between exons 2 and 4 of the SYN3
gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Kao et al. (1998) noted that the 22q12-q13 region had previously been
identified as a potential schizophrenia susceptibility locus (600850).
D22S278, which was shown by the Schizophrenia Collaborative Linkage
Group (Chromosome 22) (1996) to be significantly associated with
schizophrenia, was approximately 4.5 cM removed from D22S280, located
within an intron of the SYN3 gene.

From a study in Taiwan, Tsai et al. (2002) presented data that did not
support a large effect of the synapsin III gene in the pathogenesis of
schizophrenia. They performed systematic sequencing of the protein
coding and 5-prime promoter regions in 62 Han Chinese schizophrenic
patients with a positive family history. Further case-control
association studies were performed using genetic polymorphic markers.

609080	TITLE *609080 F-BOX AND LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT PROTEIN 13; FBXL13
;;FBL13
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXL13, are characterized
by an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by
SKP1 (601434), cullin (see CUL1; 603134), and F-box proteins, act as
protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the
F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other
protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004).

CLONING

Jin et al. (2004) reported that the human FBXL13 protein contains an
N-terminal F box, followed by a tandem array of 4 leucine-rich repeats,
a short spacer, and a second tandem array of 7 leucine-rich repeats.

By Northern blot analysis, Curtiss et al. (2005) identified 2 FBXL13
mRNA splice variants in a leukemia cell line. A message of about 1.6 kb
encodes a protein with an F-box domain and 5 leucine-rich repeats, and a
message of about 2.3 kb encodes a protein with an F-box domain and 12
leucine-rich repeats.

GENE STRUCTURE

Curtiss et al. (2005) determined that the FBXL13 gene contains 19 exons
and spans 261 kb.

MAPPING

Jin et al. (2004) stated that the FBXL13 gene maps to chromosome 7q22.1
and the mouse Fbxl13 gene maps to chromosome 5A3.

607582	TITLE *607582 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 22 (ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 6; SLC22A6
;;ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER 1; OAT1;;
PARA-AMINOHIPPURATE TRANSPORTER; PAHT;;
PAH TRANSPORTER
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SLC22A6 is a member of a family of organic anion transporters. Within
renal proximal tubules, these transporters mediate the secretion of
endogenous and exogenous metabolites, including many clinically
important drugs.

CLONING

Using the sequence of the rat PAH transporter as query, Lu et al. (1999)
identified fetal brain ESTs for SLC22A6, which they designated PAHT.
They obtained the full-length clone by RT-PCR of adult kidney mRNA. The
deduced 550-amino acid protein contains 12 transmembrane spans, 4
protein kinase C (see 176960) phosphorylation sites, 4 protein kinase A
(see 176911) phosphorylation sites, and 5 putative N-glycosylation
sites. SLC22A6 shares 87% identity with rat Oat1, 85% identity with
mouse Oat1, and 32% and 29% identity with the cation transporters OCT1
(SLC22A1; 602607) and OCTN2 (SLC22A5; 603377), respectively. Northern
blot analysis of several tissues detected a 2.4-kb transcript only in
kidney.

Race et al. (1999) cloned SLC22A6, which they designated OAT1, from a
kidney cDNA library. The deduced protein has a calculated molecular mass
of 60.3 kD. SLC22A6 has 12 transmembrane-spanning domains that are
separated by 5 intracellular loops and 6 extracellular loops; the N and
C termini are intracellular. SLC22A6 also contains 3 motifs conserved in
the amphiphilic solute facilitator family of proteins. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.4-kb transcript expressed strongly in kidney and
weakly in brain.

Bahn et al. (2000) identified a splice variant of OAT1 that has a 132-bp
in-frame deletion, resulting in the loss of transmembrane domain 11 and
half of transmembrane domain 12.

GENE FUNCTION

By analyzing PAHT transiently expressed in HeLa cells, Lu et al. (1999)
demonstrated time-dependent and saturable radiolabeled PAH uptake.
Preincubation with unlabeled alpha-ketoglutaric or with glutaric acid
stimulated PAH uptake, and preincubation with unlabeled PAH stimulated
uptake of radiolabeled alpha-ketoglutarate, consistent with
PAH/alpha-ketoglutarate exchange. Transport of radiolabeled PAH was
inhibited by furosemide, indomethacin, probenecid, and
alpha-ketoglutarate. It was not inhibited by prostaglandins or
methotrexate, indicating substrate specificity that is different than
that of rat Oat1. PAH uptake was also inhibited by phorbol esters in a
dose- and time-dependent fashion, indicating inhibition of transport by
phosphorylation through protein kinase C.

Race et al. (1999) demonstrated PAH uptake in Xenopus oocytes injected
with OAT1 mRNA. PAH uptake was dependent on chloride. Inhibitor studies
gave results similar to those reported by Lu et al. (1999).

GENE STRUCTURE

Bahn et al. (2000) determined that the SLC22A6 gene contains 10 exons
and spans 8.2 kb. The promoter region contains TATA and CCAAT boxes, a
thyroid hormone-binding site, and putative binding sites for nuclear
factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011), AP2 (107580), C/EBP-alpha (116897),
and SP1 (189906).

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid analysis, Lu et al. (1999) mapped the SLC22A6
gene to chromosome 11. By radiation hybrid analysis, Race et al. (1999)
mapped the SLC22A6 gene to chromosome 11. Bahn et al. (2000) mapped the
SLC22A6 gene to chromosome 11q13.1-q13.2 using FISH.

;;HOX ANTISENSE INTERGENIC RNA;;
LONG INTERGENIC NONCODING RNA HOTAIR;;
lincRNA HOTAIR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), such as HOTAIR, regulate
dosage compensation, imprinting, and developmental gene expression by
establishing chromatin domains in an allele- and cell-type specific
manner. HOTAIR coordinates histone modifications by serving as a modular
scaffold for multiple histone modification complexes (Tsai et al.,
2010).

CLONING

During embryonic development, fibroblasts show patterns of HOX gene
expression that reflect their position along the anterior-posterior and
proximal-distal axes of the developing body. Adult human fibroblasts
retain many features of the embryonic pattern of HOX gene expression,
including positional effects. Using HOX tiling arrays to profile
transcripts from fibroblasts representing 11 different positions of the
adult body, Rinn et al. (2007) identified more than 200 HOX ncRNAs,
including HOTAIR. Molecular cloning and Northern blot analysis confirmed
that the 2,158-nucleotide HOTAIR transcript is spliced and
polyadenylated. Tiling array data and RT-PCR showed that HOTAIR was
preferentially expressed in fibroblasts obtained from posterior and
distal sites in adult human, with highest expression in fibroblasts
obtained from the foot. In situ hybridization of developing mouse
embryos confirmed that Hotair was expressed in posterior and distal
sites, indicating conservation of the anatomic expression pattern from
development to adulthood. The HOTAIR nucleotide sequence is highly
conserved in vertebrates, whereas the amino acid sequence contains
numerous stop codons and is not conserved, suggesting that HOTAIR
functions as a long ncRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Rinn et al. (2007) showed that depletion of HOTAIR ncRNA by RNA
interference in primary human fibroblasts led to dramatic
transcriptional activation across 40 kb of the HOXD locus on chromosome
2, including HOXD8 (142985), HOXD9 (142982), HOXD10 (142984), HOXD11
(142986), and multiple ncRNAs. Depletion of HOTAIR resulted in global
loss of histone-3 (see 602810) trimethylation on lys27 over the HOXD
locus, with greatest loss in the intergenic region between HOXD4
(142981) and HOXD8. HOTAIR depletion also caused a modest but consistent
loss of SUZ12 (606245) occupancy on the HOXD locus, suggesting that
HOTAIR is required to target Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2)
occupancy and activity to silence transcription of the HOXD locus.
Immunoprecipitation of SUZ12 from nuclear extracts of foot and foreskin
primary human fibroblasts retrieved endogenous HOTAIR ncRNA. Reciprocal
protein-binding assays with HeLa cell lysates showed that the PRC2
components SUZ12 and EZH2 (601573), but not PRC1 components, bound
HOTAIR.

Gupta et al. (2010) showed that lincRNAs in HOX loci become
systematically dysregulated during breast cancer progression. The
lincRNA termed HOTAIR is increased in expression in primary breast
tumors and metastases, and HOTAIR expression level in primary tumors is
a powerful predictor of eventual metastasis and death. Enforced
expression of HOTAIR in epithelial cancer cells induced genomewide
retargeting of Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2; see 601674) to an
occupancy pattern more resembling embryonic fibroblasts, leading to
altered histone H3 lysine-27 (H3K27) methylation, gene expression, and
increased cancer invasiveness and metastasis in a manner dependent on
PRC2. Conversely, loss of HOTAIR can inhibit cancer invasiveness,
particularly in cells that possess excessive PRC2 activity. Gupta et al.
(2010) concluded that lincRNAs have active roles in modulating the
cancer epigenome and may be important targets for cancer diagnosis and
therapy.

Tsai et al. (2010) showed that HOTAIR serves as a scaffold for at least
2 distinct histone modification complexes. A 5-prime domain of HOTAIR
binds polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), whereas a 3-prime domain of
HOTAIR binds the LSD1/CoREST/REST complex (see 609132). The ability to
tether 2 distinct complexes enables RNA-mediated assembly of PCR2 and
LSD1 and coordinates targeting of PRC2 and LSD1 to chromatin for coupled
H3K27 methylation and H3K4 demethylation. Tsai et al. (2010) concluded
that lincRNAs may serve as scaffolds by providing binding surfaces to
assemble select histone modification enzymes, thereby specifying the
pattern of histone modifications on target genes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rinn et al. (2007) mapped the HOTAIR gene
to chromosome 12. It is located on the opposite strand within the
intergenic region between HOXC11 (605559) and HOXC12 (142975).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kumada et al. (2002) cloned a partial cDNA for mouse Tmem57. PCR
detected Tmem57 in all mouse tissues examined. Expression was high in
testis, lung, spleen, and pancreas, intermediate in brain, thymus, and
liver, and low in heart, kidney, small intestine, and muscle.
Fluorescence-tagged Tmem57 accumulated in nuclei of transfected HeLa
cells.

Kuvbachieva et al. (2004) cloned mouse Tmem57, which they called C61,
and identified human TMEM57 by database analysis. Both deduced proteins
contain 664 amino acids and share 99% identity. TMEM57 has 5 domains,
including an N-terminal LAG1 (606919) domain and a central ERM (see
123900)-myosin filament (see 601478) domain. The LAG1 domain contains 3
putative transmembrane domains. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos
showed that Tmem57 was brain specific. It was primarily associated with
postmigratory neurons and less so with neural proliferating cells, and
Tmem57 expression was progressively downregulated during brain
maturation. Fluorescence-tagged Tmem57 outlined the nuclear membrane
when expressed in nonneuronal cells. In primary hippocampal neurons,
Tmem57 was found in neurites and their terminals, and it partially
colocalized with synapsin-1 (SYN1; 313440), a presynaptic marker.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kuvbachieva et al. (2004) determined that the mouse and human TMEM57
genes contain 11 coding exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kuvbachieva et al. (2004) mapped the
TMEM57 gene to chromosome 1p36.13-p35.1. Kumada et al. (2002) mapped the
mouse Tmem57 gene to a region of chromosome 4 that shares homology of
synteny with human chromosome 1p.
