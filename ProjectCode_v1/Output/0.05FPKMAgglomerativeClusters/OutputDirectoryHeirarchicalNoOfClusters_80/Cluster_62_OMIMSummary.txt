430000	TITLE *430000 INTERLEUKIN 3 RECEPTOR, Y-CHROMOSOMAL; IL3RA
;;IL3RY;;
IL3RAY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The receptor for interleukin-3 (IL3; 147740) is a heterodimer that
shares a beta chain (CSF2RB; 138981) in common with the receptors for
IL5 (IL5R; 147851) and GMCSF (CSF2R; 306250), and, like these other
cytokine receptors, has a ligand-specific alpha chain (IL3RA).

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Kremer et al. (1993) demonstrated
that the IL3RY gene is located in the pseudoautosomal region of the X
and Y chromosomes. See 308385.

608457	TITLE *608457 CHROMOBOX HOMOLOG 7; CBX7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening for mouse cDNAs that could extend the life span of cultured
normal human prostate primary epithelial cells, Gil et al. (2004) cloned
Cbx7. They cloned human CBX7 by searching databases for sequences
similar to mouse Cbx7 and by PCR of a human embryo cDNA library. CBX7
contains an N-terminal chromodomain and a C-terminal Pc box.
Phylogenetic analysis showed that CBX7 shares highest similarity with
CBX2 (602770), CBX4 (603079), CBX6, and CBX8. CBX7 mRNA was highly
expressed in brain, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle, and weakly
expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Gil et al. (2004) observed that, during serial passage of mouse
embryonic fibroblasts, expression of Cbx7 gradually decreased with
passage number and totally disappeared in senescent mouse embryonic
fibroblasts. Expression of either mouse or human CBX7 could extend the
cellular life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human cells by
downregulating expression of the Ink4a/Arf gene (CDKN2A; 600160).
Expression of human CBX7 mutants lacking the Pc box or with mutations in
critical residues of the chromodomain did not extend the life span of
cultured cells. CBX7 interacted with itself and with RING1 (602045) in
an in vitro pull-down assay, and CBX7 colocalized with RING1 in distinct
nuclear foci-like structures termed Pc bodies.

By database and immunohistochemical analyses, Scott et al. (2007)
detected high expression of CBX7 in germinal center lymphocytes and
germinal center-derived follicular lymphomas, where elevated expression
correlated with high MYC (190080) expression and advanced tumor grade.
Using mice with lymphoid-specific expression of Cbx7, Scott et al.
(2007) showed that Cbx7, acting through Ink4a/Arf, cooperated with Myc
to promote aggressive B-cell lymphomagenesis. They concluded that
CBX7-mediated repression of INK4A/ARF transcription is important for
tumorigenesis.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CBX7
gene to chromosome 22 (TMAP HSC0XA102).

182350	TITLE *182350 ATPase, Na+/K+ TRANSPORTING, ALPHA-3 POLYPEPTIDE; ATP1A3
;;SODIUM-POTASSIUM-ATPase, ALPHA-3 POLYPEPTIDE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The alpha subunit of the Na,K-ATPase is the catalytic subunit. Three
isoforms are expressed in the nervous system: ATP1A1 (182310), ATP1A2
(182340), and ATP1A3 (de Carvalho Aguiar et al., 2004).

GENE FUNCTION

Agrin (AGRN; 103320) mediates accumulation of acetylcholine receptors at
the developing neuromuscular junction through its interaction with MUSK
(601296), and it has also been implicated in brain development. Through
biochemical studies, Hilgenberg et al. (2006) found that agrin bound
Atp1a3 in mouse cortical neurons. Immunohistochemical analysis showed
that Atp1a3 colocalized with agrin-binding sites at synapses. Agrin
inhibited Atp1a3 activity, resulting in membrane depolarization and
increased action potential frequency in mouse cortical neurons in
culture and acute slice. An agrin fragment that acted as a competitive
antagonist depressed action potential frequency, indicating that
endogenous agrin regulates native Atp1a3 function. Hilgenberg et al.
(2006) concluded that agrin regulates activity-dependent processes in
neurons through its interaction with ATP1A3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ovchinnikov et al. (1988) determined that the ATP1A3 gene has about
25,000 basepairs and that its protein-coding region includes 23 exons.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of DNA from panels of rodent/human somatic cell
hybrid lines, Yang-Feng et al. (1988) mapped the ATP1A3 gene to
chromosome 19q12-q13.2. Harley et al. (1988) concluded that the order is
qter--DM--APOC2--ATP1A3--cen.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Dystonia 12

In 7 unrelated families with rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism, or
dystonia-12 (DYT12; 128235), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004) identified
6 different heterozygous mutations in the ATP1A3 gene
(182350.0001-182350.0006). Functional expression studies and structural
analysis suggested that the mutations impaired enzyme activity or
stability.

Anselm et al. (2009) and Blanco-Arias et al. (2009) reported de novo
heterozygous ATP1A3 mutations (182350.0007 and 182350.0008,
respectively) in patients with DYT12.

- Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood 2

In 82 of 105 patients with alternating hemiplegia of childhood-2 (AHC2;
615820), Heinzen et al. (2012) identified 19 different heterozygous
mutations in the ATP1A3 gene (see, e.g., 182350.0009-182350.0012). The
first mutations were identified through exome sequencing of affected
individuals. Thirteen of the 18 mutations observed in sporadic cases
were confirmed to occur de novo. Since it was possible that some
variants represented polymorphisms, Heinzen et al. (2012) estimated that
mutations in the ATP1A3 gene may be responsible for up to 74% of
patients with sporadic, typical AHC. Several mutations were recurrent,
and some occurred within hypermutable sequences. All patients had
infantile onset of hemiplegia attacks, usually associated with episodes
of quadriparesis, abnormal eye movements, autonomic signs, seizures,
dystonia, ataxia, chorea, and developmental delay. Transfection of
several of the mutations in HeLa cells showed protein levels similar to
wildtype, but ATP1A3 activity was significantly decreased. In contrast,
transfection of DYT12-associated mutations resulted in decreased protein
levels as well as decreased activity. The report expanded the spectrum
of phenotypes associated with mutations in the ATP1A3 gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ashmore et al. (2009) identified 6 different EMS-induced missense
mutations in the Atp1a2 and Atp1a3 genes in Drosophila. All mutations
resulted in reduced respiration activity consistent with a loss of
ATPase function and a hypomorphic effect. Different mutant strains
exhibited some abnormalities, including progressive
temperature-dependent paralysis, progressive stress-sensitive paralysis,
and decreased locomotor activity in response to startle, suggesting a
decrease in maximal locomotion capacity. Neuromuscular studies showed
allele-specific pathology, including brain vacuoles and myopathology,
and biochemical studies showed decreased metabolic rates. An unexpected
finding was the some mutant strains had increased longevity, which was
not related to caloric restriction. Low doses of ouabain showed a
similar effect on longevity in control groups. Ashmore et al. (2009)
suggested that these findings may be relevant for studying the
pathogenesis of FHM2 and DYT12 (128235).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, THR613MET

In a sporadic patient (Linazasoro et al., 2002) and affected members of
a second family (Zaremba et al., 2004) with dystonia-12 (DYT12; 128235),
de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 1838C-T
transition in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in a thr613-to-met (T613M)
substitution in a highly conserved residue near the phosphorylation
domain on the cytoplasmic face of the protein. The mutation was not
identified in 500 northern European control chromosomes.

Brashear et al. (2007) identified the T613M mutation in a family with
DYT12 reported by Pittock et al. (2000).

.0002
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, ILE274THR

In a patient with dystonia-12 (128235), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004)
identified a heterozygous 821T-C transition in the ATP1A3 gene,
resulting in an ile274-to-thr (I274T) substitution in a highly conserved
residue in the transmembrane domain of the protein. The mutation was not
identified in 500 northern European control chromosomes. The patient had
disease onset at age 37 years.

.0003
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, GLU277LYS

In a patient with dystonia-12 (128235), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004)
identified a heterozygous 829G-A transition in exon 8 of the ATP1A3
gene, resulting in a glu277-to-lys (E277K) substitution in a highly
conserved residue in the transmembrane domain of the protein. The
mutation was not identified in 500 northern European control
chromosomes. The patient had disease onset at age 20 years.

Tarsy et al. (2010) identified the E277K mutation in a 29-year-old woman
of African Caribbean descent with DYT12. She had onset at age 26 years
of weakness and flexion of the left hand and ankle, which progressed
rapidly over the next few years to become frank dystonia of the left arm
and bulbar symptoms, including dysphagia, laryngeal dysfunction with
task-specific dysphonia, and oropharyngeal dysmotility. She also had
mild parkinsonism, with hypomimia and wide-based gait. Treatment with
oral trihexyphenidyl and botulinum injection into selected laryngeal
muscles resulted in clinical improvement.

.0004
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, ILE758SER

In 12 affected members of a family with dystonia-12 (128235) reported by
Dobyns et al. (1993), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004) identified a
heterozygous 2273T-G transversion in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in an
ile758-to-ser (I758S) substitution in a highly conserved residue in the
transmembrane domain of the protein. The mutation was not identified in
500 northern European control chromosomes.

.0005
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, PHE780LEU

In 2 affected members of a family with dystonia-12 (128235), de Carvalho
Aguiar et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 2338T-C transition in the
ATP1A3 gene, resulting in a phe780-to-leu (F780L) substitution in a
highly conserved residue in the transmembrane region of the protein
close to the extracellular surface. The mutation was not identified in
500 northern European control chromosomes.

.0006
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, ASP801TYR

In 4 affected members of a family with dystonia-12 (128235) reported by
Brashear et al. (1997), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004) identified a
heterozygous 2401G-T transversion in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in an
asp801-to-tyr (D801Y) substitution in a highly conserved residue in the
transmembrane region of the protein. The mutation was not identified in
500 northern European control chromosomes.

.0007
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, ASP923ASN

In a boy with early-onset DYT12 (128235) at age 4 years, Anselm et al.
(2009) identified a heterozygous de novo 2767G-A transition in exon 20
of the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in an asp923-to-asn (D923N) substitution.
The mutation was not found in 338 Caucasian control chromosomes. The
substitution was predicted to occur in a residue buried in the membrane
close to the ion-binding residue gln920, suggesting that it may affect
enzyme activity. He was born of an unaffected Caucasian father and
Chinese mother. The onset of dystonia was abrupt, occurring after mild
trauma to the forehead. He developed mutism, eye convergence, and
inability to walk, which later evolved into severe dystonia, severe
dysarthria, and drooling. The condition stabilized over several months,
and he showed mild improvement over the next 8 years. About a year after
onset, he developed unusual episodes of flaccidity lasting for hours,
later replaced by shorter episodes of stiffness. Treatment with L-dopa
was not effective. At the time of the report, he had bulbar symptoms,
striking oromotor dystonia with inability to speak or swallow well, and
apraxia.

.0008
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, 3-BP DUP, 3191TAC

In a 16-year-old female with DYT12 (128235), Blanco-Arias et al. (2009)
reported a de novo heterozygous 3-bp duplication (3191dupTAC) in exon 23
of the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in duplication of tyr1013, the C-terminal
amino acid of the protein before the stop codon. The mutation was not
found in either parent, her brother, or in 218 control individuals. HeLa
cells expressing the mutant protein showed decreased survival in
response to ouabain challenge, but no defect was detected in protein
expression or plasma membrane targeting. Functional analysis
demonstrated a drastic 40- to 50-fold reduction in Na(+) affinity in the
mutant. Blanco-Arias et al. (2009) suggested a crucial role for the C
terminus of the alpha-subunit in the function of the Na+/K+-ATPase and
emphasized a key impact of Na(+) affinity in the pathophysiology of
DYT12.

.0009
ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2
ATP1A3, ASP801ASN

In 36 of 95 unrelated patients with alternating hemiplegia of childhood
(614820), Heinzen et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 2401G-A
transition in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in an asp801-to-asn (D801N)
substitution in the sixth transmembrane domain. The mutation was
demonstrated to occur de novo in cases where parental material was
available. All patients had infantile onset of hemiplegia attacks,
usually associated with episodes of quadriparesis, abnormal eye
movements, autonomic signs, seizures, dystonia, ataxia, chorea, and
developmental delay. Transfection of the mutation in HeLa cells showed
protein levels similar to wildtype, but ATP1A3 activity was
significantly decreased. Evaluation of the crystal structure of the
protein predicted that the D801N substitution would prevent the binding
of potassium ions to the pump.

.0010
ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2
ATP1A3, GLU815LYS

In 19 patients with alternating hemiplegia of childhood-2 (614820),
Heinzen et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 2443G-A transition in
the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in a glu815-to-lys (E815K) substitution in
the sixth transmembrane domain. The mutation was shown to occur de novo
in all patients whose parents were available for study. Transfection of
the mutation in HeLa cells showed protein levels similar to wildtype,
but ATP1A3 activity was significantly decreased.

.0011
ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2
ATP1A3, SER811PRO

In 4 unrelated patients with AHC2 (614820), Heinzen et al. (2012)
identified a de novo heterozygous 2431T-C transition in the ATP1A3 gene,
resulting in a ser811-to-pro (S811P) substitution in the sixth
transmembrane domain. Transfection of the mutation in HeLa cells showed
protein levels similar to wildtype, but ATP1A3 activity was
significantly decreased.

.0012
ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2
ATP1A3, GLY947ARG

In 5 patients with AHC2 (614820), Heinzen et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous 2839G-A transition in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in a
gly947-to-arg (G947R) substitution in the ninth transmembrane domain.
The mutation was shown to occur de novo in all patients whose parents
were available for study.

;;KIR2.4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channel family are
characterized by a channel structure with 2 transmembrane segments
surrounding putative pore loop. The Kir2 subfamily contains channels
characterized by their strong current rectification. By screening a rat
brain library with a bovine PCR fragment based on a human Kir-like EST
(GenBank GENBANK W25800), Topert et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA encoding
Kir2.4, a Kir2 subfamily member. In situ hybridization revealed that
Kir2.4 is expressed predominantly in motoneurons of cranial nerve motor
nuclei within the general somatic and special visceral motor cell
column. The unique Kir2.4 expression pattern and in situ measurements of
the functional characteristics of Kir2.4 in rat brainstem led the
authors to conclude that these channels serve an important function in
controlling the excitability of brainstem motoneurons. Northern blot
analysis revealed that Kir2.4 is expressed specifically in human brain.

;;MSS1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; MSS1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mss1 is a yeast mitochondrial GTP-binding protein that functionally
interacts with 15S rRNA. By searching an EST database for sequences
similar to Mss1, followed by RT-PCR using hepatoma cell line total RNA
and 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Li and Guan (2002) cloned 5 variants of
GTPBP3, an Mss1 homolog. The variants are generated by alternative
splicing and through the use of alternate polyadenylation signals. Two
variants differ only in their 3-prime UTRs and encode an identical
492-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 52.0 kD. Two
other variants encode an identical 471-amino acid protein, and another
variant encodes a 524-amino acid protein. GTPBP3 contains a typical
mitochondria targeting presequence, 2 GTP-binding domains, a p21 RAS
(see 190020)-like domain, and an SRC (190090) homology-3 (SH3) domain.
GTPBP3 shows extensive conservation of amino acid sequences with Mss1
homologs from several diverse species, including bacteria, yeast, and
nematode. Mouse and human GTPBP3 share 81% amino acid identity. Northern
blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of 2.6- and 1.9-kb
transcripts. Expression was highest in skeletal muscle, kidney, liver,
and heart, moderate in whole brain, thymus, spleen, and small intestine,
and low in colon, lung, and leukocytes. GTPBP3 was also expressed in all
individual brain regions examined. The larger transcript was more
abundant in most tissues. GTPBP3 colocalized with a mitochondrial marker
in transfected osteosarcoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Yeast cells carrying mutant alleles of Mss1 coupled with a 15S rRNA
mutation that corresponds to the 1555A-G mutation of human 12S rRNA
(561000.0001) fail to synthesize subunit 1 of cytochrome oxidase (see
516030) and manifest a respiratory-deficient phenotype. Li and Guan
(2002) found that overexpression of GTPBP3 complemented the respiration
defect of yeast carrying the Mss1 and 15S rRNA mutations. They suggested
that, like yeast Mss1, GTPBP3 may influence the phenotypic expression of
the 1555A-G mutation in 12S rRNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Li and Guan (2002) determined that the GTPBP3 gene contains 9 exons and
spans more than 6 kb. There are 2 putative polyadenylation signals.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Li and Guan (2002) mapped the GTPBP3 gene
to chromosome 19.

614176	TITLE *614176 ZINC FINGER FYVE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 28; ZFYVE28
;;LST2, C. ELEGANS, ORTHOLOG OF; LST2;;
KIAA1643
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned ZFYVE28, which they designated
KIAA1643. The deduced protein contains 993 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA of
human tissues detected very high ZFYVE28 expression in whole adult
brain, followed by fetal brain, with much lower expression in all other
tissues examined. Within specific adult brain regions, highest
expression was detected in amygdala, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and
thalamus, followed by substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus.

By searching a human database for sequences similar to C. elegans Lst2,
Mosesson et al. (2009) identified ZFYVE28, which they called LST2. The
deduced 887-amino acid protein contains a C-terminal FYVE domain and 2
conserved regions, an N-terminal domain, called NDom, and a central
domain, called the CBox. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis of mouse
tissues detected high Lst2 expression in brain. LST2 was also detected
in human cell lines. The most prominent protein had an apparent
molecular mass of 130 to 140 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Mosesson et al. (2009) found that LST2 regulated internalization and
degradation of EGFR (131550), thereby terminating EGFR signaling. LST2
was monoubiquitinated on lys87 within the NDom domain, and
ubiquitination required the CBox. In the absence of ubiquitination, the
FYVE domain of LST2 bound the endosomal phospholipid
phosphoinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P), and LST2 localized to early
endosomes with EGFR and promoted receptor degradation. Ubiquitination of
LST2 inhibited its PI3P-binding ability and released it from endosomes.
Yeast 2-hybrid analysis of mouse brain lysates showed LST2 also bound
Trim3 (605493), a coordinator of endosomal trafficking.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the ZFYVE28
gene to chromosome 4. Mosesson et al. (2009) stated that the ZFYVE28
gene maps to chromosome 4p16.
