606343	TITLE *606343 POLYMERASE, DNA, LAMBDA; POLL
DESCRIPTION DNA polymerases can participate in both replication of the genome and
DNA repair processes. The human genome contains multiple DNA polymerase
genes.

CLONING

By searching sequence databases to identify new members of the polX
family, Aoufouchi et al. (2000) identified EST clones representing 2 DNA
polymerases, POLM (606344) and POLL, which they called pol mu and pol
lambda, respectively. By screening bone marrow and lymph node cDNA
libraries, they isolated a full-length POLL cDNA. POLL encodes a deduced
575-amino acid protein predicted to contain a polX domain, a BRCA-1
C-terminal (BRCT) domain, and 2 helix-hairpin-helix (HHH) DNA-binding
motifs. POLL structurally resembles terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase
(TDT; 187410). It shares 34% amino acid identity with DNA polymerase
beta (POLB; 174760) and 82% identity with mouse Poll. Aoufouchi et al.
(2000) found that POLL has template-dependent DNA polymerase activity in
vitro. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.7-kb POLL transcript with
highest expression in testis and fetal liver and very weak expression in
many other tissues. They identified POLL splice variants which they
considered to be nonfunctional. Using semiquantitative RT-PCR
amplification, Aoufouchi et al. (2000) concluded that POLL mRNA
expression is downregulated in a dose- and time-dependent manner upon
cell exposure to DNA damaging agents.

Aoufouchi et al. (2000) provided a phylogenetic comparison of yeast and
human proteins of the polX family.

GENE STRUCTURE

Aoufouchi et al. (2000) determined that POLL is encoded by 8 exons and
spans approximately 9 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the POLL
gene to human chromosome 10 (TMAP sts-W69567).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Aminoacylase-3 is a hydrolase that removes the acyl group from several
acylated aromatic amino acids and from S-benzyl-N-acetylcysteine
(Pushkin et al., 2004).

CLONING

Pushkin et al. (2004) cloned mouse Acy3, which encodes a deduced
318-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of about 35.2
kD. Acy3 has no membrane domain, but it contains consensus sites for
N-glycosylation, tyrosine sulfation, tyrosine and threonine
phosphorylation, and myristoylation. Northern blot analysis detected
high expression of an approximately 1.4-kb Acy3 transcript in kidney,
followed by liver. Weaker expression was detected in heart, small
intestine, brain, lung, testis, and stomach. Testis expressed an
additional transcript of about 2.2 kb. Immunocytochemical analysis of
mouse kidney revealed Acy3 localization to the apical membrane of S1
convoluted proximal tubule cells and in the cytoplasm of S2 and S3
proximal straight tubule cells. Gel-filtration and transmission electron
microscopy showed that Acy3 formed tetramers.

GENE FUNCTION

By assaying mouse Acy3 expressed in HEK293 cells, Pushkin et al. (2004)
found that it used all acetylated substrates examined, which included
N-acetyl-L-histidine, N-acetyl-L-tyrosine, N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine, and
S-benzyl-N-acetyl-L-cysteine. It showed highest affinity for
S-benzyl-N-acetyl-L-cysteine and had a pH optimum of 7.5 to 7.7.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the ACY3 gene to chromosome 11q13.2 based on an
alignment of the ACY3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF359506) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Pushkin et al. (2004) stated that mouse Acy3 maps to chromosome 19.

606696	TITLE *606696 KATANIN, p60 SUBUNIT, A1; KATNA1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Microtubules are dynamic polymers of alpha-tubulin (e.g., TUBA3; 602529)
and beta-tubulin (TUBB; 191130) that are used to organize membranous
organelles during interphase and to segregate chromosomes during
mitosis. Microtubule-severing proteins generate internal breaks within
microtubules during metaphase but not during interphase. Katanin is an
ATP-dependent microtubule-severing protein composed of p60 and p80
subunits. Katanin p80 (KATNB1; 602703) is concentrated at centrosomes
during interphase.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologs of sea urchin p60 katanin,
followed by 3-prime RACE with fibroblast cDNA, McNally and Thomas (1998)
isolated a cDNA encoding KATNA1. Sequence analysis predicted that the
491-amino acid KATNA1 protein contains a central consensus cyclin B
(CCNB1; 123836)/CDC2 (116940) phosphorylation site (TPLK). The
N-terminal 80 residues of KATNA1 and sea urchin p60 katanin are 50%
identical, and the C-terminal 318-residue AAA (for 'ATPase associated
with a variety of cellular activities') ATPase domain of KATNA1 and sea
urchin p60 katanin are 75% identical. Immunoblot analysis revealed wide
expression of a 55- to 60-kD protein that was coexpressed with p80
katanin in frog eggs. Anti-KATNA1 antibody inhibited
microtubule-severing activity in Xenopus eggs. Immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated diffuse expression and focal colocalization with
gamma-tubulin (TUBG; 191135) in interphase fibroblast microtubule
asters, as is also seen with KATNB1. McNally and Thomas (1998) observed
that the area occupied by KATNA1 is twice that occupied by TUBG during
metaphase. McNally and Thomas (1998) proposed that CCNB1/CDC2 activates
KATNA1 microtubule-severing activity near centrosomes during mitosis.

Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis, Karabay et
al. (2004) showed that Katna1 localizes along the length of axons at
early stages of neuronal development in the rat and mouse, with
expression generally higher in and near growth cones of extending axons
and in distal regions. Katna1 expression declined upon neuronal
maturation.

GENE FUNCTION

Toyo-Oka et al. (2005) identified KATNA1 as a molecular target of NDEL1
(607538). Phosphorylation of Ndel1 by Cdk5 (123831) facilitated
interaction between NDEL1 and KATNA1, suggesting that phosphorylated
NDEL1 may regulate the distribution of KATNA1. Abnormal accumulation of
Katna1 in the nucleus of Ndel1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts
supported an essential role for NDEL1 in KATNA1 regulation. Complete
loss of Ndel1 or expression of dominant-negative Katna1 mutants in
migrating neurons resulted in defective migration and elongation of
nuclear-centrosomal distance. Toyo-Oka et al. (2005) suggested that
NDEL1 may be essential for mitotic cell division and neuronal migration,
not only via regulation of cytoplasmic dynein function, but also by
modulation of KATNA1 localization and function.

Postmitotic neurons require microtubules for dynamic scaffolding within
axons, dendrites, and growth cones. Microtubules are nucleated
exclusively at centrosomes and must be severed from the centrosome for
transport into the axon; shorter microtubules are transported along
axons more quickly than long microtubules. Using overexpression and
knockdown studies with cultured rodent neurons, Karabay et al. (2004)
showed that Katna1 is an active microtubule-severing enzyme with a
critical role in neuronal microtubule dynamics. Katna1 expression
dropped when axons were presented with target cells that caused them to
stop growing.

Iwaya et al. (2010) showed that the N-terminal microtubule interacting
and trafficking (MIT) domains of mouse and human KATNA1 bound
unpolymerized, but not polymerized, tubulin. The isolated MIT domain of
KATNA1 formed an antiparallel 3-stranded helix, with a hydrophobic core
of partly conserved alanine residues. Mutagenesis experiments revealed
that positively charged arg49 and lys67 of helix 3 are required for
tubulin binding. A coiled-coil region that follows the MIT domain
mediates dimer formation and when included in the protein fragment
interfered with binding of the MIT domain to tubulin.

Using cDNA constructs based on mouse p60 and p80 (602703), Iwaya et al.
(2012) showed that the N-terminal MIT domain of p60 interacted with the
C-terminal domain (CTD) of p80. Binding of either microtubules or the
p80-CTD to the p60 MIT domain stimulated the ATPase and
microtubule-severing activity of p60. Ca(2+) bound to a separate region
of the MIT domain of p60 and negatively regulated microtubule- or
p80-enhanced p60 activity. Ca(2+) did not inhibit the basal ATPase
activity of p60 or the binding of p60 to microtubules.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the KATNA1
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP EST392905).

Hartz (2012) mapped the KATNA1 gene to chromosome 6q25.1 based on the
alignment of the KATNA1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF056022) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;BRCC4;;
BRCC45
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Li et al. (1995) cloned BRE from a placenta cDNA library. The deduced
protein contains 383 amino acids. Northern blot analysis of normal human
fibroblasts detected a single BRE mRNA at 1.7 to 1.9 kb. Northern blot
analysis of several rat tissues detected highest expression in testis
and intermediate expression in brain and ovary. Using the juxtamembrane
domain of the p55 TNF receptor (TNFRSF1A; 191190) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen, Gu et al. (1998) cloned Bre from a mouse cerebellum
cDNA library.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (1995) found that the expression of BRE decreased following
DNA damage in normal human fibroblasts caused by UV irradiation or
4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) exposure. Similar decreased BRE
expression was observed in retinoic acid-treated human brain glioma
cells and promyelocytic cells. BRE expression was unchanged in cells
following growth inhibition.

Using protein-binding assays and immunoprecipitation analysis in HEK293
cells, Gu et al. (1998) confirmed the interaction between mouse Bre and
Tnfrsf1a. Bre specifically interacted with Tnfrsf1a but not with other
TNF family members. Overexpression of Bre inhibited TNF-induced
NF-kappa-B activation.

Dong et al. (2003) demonstrated that in human cell lines BRE and BRCC3
(300617) are components of a holoenzyme complex containing BRCA1
(113705), BRCA2 (600185), BARD1 (601593), and RAD51 (179617), which they
called the BRCA1- and BRCA2-containing complex (BRCC). The complex
showed UBC5 (see UBE2D1; 602961)-dependent ubiquitin E3 ligase activity.
Inclusion of BRE and BRCC3 enhanced ubiquitination by the complex, and
cancer-associated truncations in BRCA1 reduced the association of BRE
and BRCC3 with the complex. RNA interference of BRE and BRCC3 in HeLa
cells increased cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation and resulted in a
defect in G2/M checkpoint arrest. Dong et al. (2003) concluded that the
BRCC is a ubiquitin E3 ligase that enhances cellular survival following
DNA damage.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the BRE
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP RH66226).

;;PEROXIN 14;;
NFE2-ASSOCIATED POLYPEPTIDE 2; NAPP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Working with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Albertini et al. (1997) described
peroxin-14 (PEX14), the first membrane-bound peroxisomal protein that
binds to the peroxisomal type-2 targeting signal (PTS2) receptor, PEX7
(601757). Thus, the PEX14 protein may represent the functional docking
site for PTS2-dependent protein import to the peroxisome. In addition to
the interaction with the PTS2 receptor, PEX14 protein was found to
interact with PEX5 protein (600414), the PTS1 receptor. This observation
suggested the overlapping of 2 import pathways, with PEX14 being the
point of convergence. Moreover, PEX14 also interacted with 2 other
membrane-bound peroxins, including the SH3 domain protein PEX13
(601789), the putative docking protein for PTS1-dependent protein
import. Albertini et al. (1997) proposed that these 3 peroxins are
components of a common translocation machinery.

Using yeast Pex14 sequences to probe EST databases, Fransen et al.
(1998) identified a cDNA encoding PEX14. The deduced 377-amino acid
protein contains a nonmembrane-spanning hydrophobic region, a
coiled-coil region, and a charged, acidic C terminus; it has no class II
SH3-binding motif. Western blot analysis showed expression of a 57-kD
protein.

By searching an EST database using S. cerevisiae Pex14 as query, Will et
al. (1999) identified a cDNA encoding PEX14 in a breast cell library.
The deduced protein contains 2 conserved coiled-coil region and has a
calculated molecular mass of about 41 kD. The human and yeast proteins
share 26% identity. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a
2.1-kb transcript in all tissues examined. Western blot analysis of
human fibroblast and in vitro translated protein revealed an apparent
molecular mass of about 55 kD, which may reflect its high content of
acidic amino acids. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed
colocalization with peroxisomal catalase. PEX14 was found in the
particulate fraction of fractionated cells and resisted salt or alkali
extraction, suggesting that it is an integral membrane protein. Protease
protection assays indicated that the C terminus is cytosolic and that
the N terminus likely protrudes into the peroxisomal lumen.

Gavva et al. (2002) identified PEX14, which they called NAPP2, as a
protein in an erythroleukemia expression library that interacted with
nuclear factor erythroid-2 (NFE2; 601490). Northern blot analysis
revealed a transcript of about 2 kb expressed in all cell lines tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Ligand blot analysis by Fransen et al. (1998) determined that PEX14
binds to both the PTS1 receptor (PEX5) and weakly with the SH3 domain of
PEX13. Biochemical analysis indicated that PEX14 is required for the
import of PTS1-containing proteins into peroxisomes.

Will et al. (1999) found that Pex14 deficiency in S. cerevisiae could
not be rescued by expression of human PEX14, indicating that the
proteins are not functionally interchangeable. Overexpression of PEX14
in normal skin fibroblasts led to the decoration of tubular structures
and mislocalization of peroxisomal catalase to the cytosol. Unlike the
findings in yeast, PEX14 did not form homooligomers or interact with
PTS2 receptor or PEX13.

By in vitro binding assays of truncated recombinant proteins, Gavva et
al. (2002) found that interaction between PEX14 and NFE2 occurs through
the N-terminal 203 amino acids of PEX14 and the N-terminal 114 amino
acids of NFE2. Expression of PEX14 inhibited NFE2-directed
transcriptional activation. PEX14 also functioned as a corepressor and
interacted specifically with HDAC1 (601241), but not with HDAC2 (605164)
or HDAC3 (605166).

MAPPING

By FISH, Gavva et al. (2002) mapped the PEX14 gene to chromosome 1p36.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with Zellweger syndrome (PBD13A; 614887), Shimozawa et al.
(2004) identified a gln185-to-ter mutation in the PEX14 gene (Q185X;
601791.0001). Although PEX14 mutants had been identified in yeast and in
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, this was said to be the first
reported case of human PEX14 deficiency. Shimozawa et al. (2004) stated
that PEX14 is a member of the complementation group of peroxisome
biogenesis disorders, and designated it complementation group K. PEX14
rescued the import of a PTS1-dependent as well as a PTS2-dependent
protein into the peroxisomes in fibroblasts from the patient. The
patient's fibroblasts lacked PEX14, as determined by immunocytochemical
analysis.

PEX14, GLN185TER

In an infant with Zellweger syndrome (PBD13A; 614887), Shimozawa et al.
(2004) identified a homozygous 553C-T transition in the PEX14 gene,
resulting in a gln185-to-ter (Q185X) substitution in a putative
coiled-coil region of the protein. At birth the patient showed typical
craniofacial dysmorphia of Zellweger syndrome, including large open
fontanels, high forehead, flat occiput, low/broad nasal bridge, and
micrognathia, as well as neurologic abnormalities including hypotonia.
Plasma analysis showed elevated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) and
di- and trihydroxycholestanoic acid, and a normal phytanic acid level.
Erythrocyte plasmalogens were undetectable. The patient died at 10 days
of age.

In a Pakistani patient with Zellweger syndrome (PBD13A; 614887), born of

deletion in the PEX14 gene, resulting in the deletion of exon 3,
frameshift, and premature protein truncation. Cultured skin fibroblasts
from the patient showed absence of PEX14 protein and absence of normal
peroxisomes. The patient had severe cholestasis and hepatomegaly,
neuronal migration defect, and progressive hypotonia.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Neurotrophic factors, such as GDNF (600837), NTN (602018), and PSPN
(602921), orchestrate multiple aspects of the development and
maintenance of the central and peripheral nervous systems. These GDNF
family ligands signal though a multicomponent receptor system composed
of a high affinity binding component, (GFRA1-GFRA4; see 601496) and a
common signaling component, the RET (164761) receptor tyrosine kinase.
By searching databases for sequences related to NTN, Baloh et al. (1998)
identified human and mouse genomic clones and cDNAs encoding a novel
member of the GDNF family, which they named Artemin. Northern blot
analysis revealed that Artemin is expressed at low levels in many
peripheral adult tissues. Using in situ hybridization analysis of rat
embryos at E14, the authors found that Artemin is expressed in regions
that are likely to influence the development of peripheral neurons, such
as the nerve roots, but not the developing neurons, of the dorsal root
ganglia. The predicted human Artemin protein contains a signal peptide
and a large proregion. The mature protein contains 113 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Baloh et al. (1998) demonstrated that Artemin, like GDNF and NTN,
supports the survival of neurons from all peripheral ganglia examined,
including sympathetic, neural crest, and placodally derived sensory
neurons. In addition, Artemin can support the survival of at least 1
population of central nervous system neurons, the dopaminergic midbrain
neurons. Artemin is a ligand for the GFR-alpha-3 (GRFA3; 605710)
coreceptor, which together with RET, represents the preferred
multicomponent receptor for Artemin signaling.

In a mouse model of neuropathic pain, Gardell et al. (2003) found that
systemic, intermittent administration of artemin produced dose- and
time-related reversal of nerve injury-induced pain behavior as well as
partial to complete normalization of multiple morphologic and
neurochemical features of the injury state. After spinal injury, there
was an increase in dorsal root ganglion cells that were GFR-alpha-3
reactive, the primary site of artemin action.

GENE STRUCTURE

Baloh et al. (1998) determined that the Artemin gene contains 3 introns.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Baloh et al. (1998) mapped the Artemin
gene to chromosome 1p33-p32.

ANIMAL MODEL

Honma et al. (2002) found that Artn- and Gfra3-deficient mice shared
abnormalities in the migration and axonal projection pattern of the
entire sympathetic nervous system, resulting in abnormal innervation of
target tissues and cell death due to lack of neurotrophic support. They
visualized Artn expression in transgenic mice expressing
fluorescence-tagged Artn in order to characterize these defects.
Fluorescence was detected along blood vessels and in cells nearby to
sympathetic axonal projections. Honma et al. (2002) confirmed the
chemoattractive properties of Artn by demonstrating that sympathetic

;;MANNOSIDASE, ALPHA B, LYSOSOMAL; MANB;;
LAMAN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Alpha-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.24) is a lysosomal hydrolase that cleaves
alpha-linked mannose residues from the nonreducing end of N-linked
glycoproteins (Gotoda et al., 1998).

See also beta-mannosidase (MANBA; 609489).

CLONING

Nebes and Schmidt (1994) isolated and sequenced a cDNA for
alpha-mannosidase. Liao et al. (1996) used RT-PCR to clone 2 cDNAs
encoding human lysosomal alpha-mannosidase. The shorter of the 2 cDNAs
encodes a 3-kb open reading frame which, when expressed, produces a
functional alpha-mannosidase enzyme; the longer cDNA, encoding a 3.6-kb
open reading frame, produced no alpha-mannosidase activity when
expressed. Northern blot analysis identified a major 3-kb mRNA
transcript in all human tissues tested and a minor 3.6-kb mRNA
transcript in several adult tissues.

Nilssen et al. (1997) reported purification and characterization of
lysosomal alpha-mannosidase, which they symbolized LAMAN, from human
placenta. They found that the enzyme was synthesized as a single-chain
precursor which is processed into 3 glycopeptides of 70, 42, and 15 kD.
The 70-kD peptide is further partially proteolyzed into 3 more peptides
that are joined by disulfide bridges. The deduced amino acid sequence
contains a putative signal peptide of 48 amino acids followed by a
polypeptide sequence of 962 amino acids. Northern blot analysis revealed
a single transcript of approximately 3.5 kb present in all tissues
examined, but at varying levels.

Berg et al. (1997) reported the purification of feline liver lysosomal
alpha-mannosidase and determination of its cDNA sequence. The active
enzyme consists of 3 polypeptides, with molecular masses of 72, 41, and
12 kD, joined by noncovalent forces. They demonstrated that the enzyme
is synthesized as a single-chain precursor with a putative signal
peptide of 50 amino acids followed by a polypeptide chain of 957 amino
acids, which is cleaved into the 3 polypeptides of the mature enzyme.
The deduced amino acid sequence was 81.1% and 83.2% identical with the
human and bovine sequences, respectively. Tollersrud et al. (1997)
purified the bovine kidney enzyme to homogeneity and cloned the gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Riise et al. (1997) determined that the MANB gene spans 21.5 kb and
contains 24 exons. By primer extension analysis, the major transcription
initiation sites were mapped to positions -309, -196, and -191 relative
to the first in-frame ATG. No CAAT or TATA sequences were identified
within the 134 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site, but the
5-prime flanking region contains several GC-rich regions with putative
binding sites for the transcription factors Sp1 (189906), AP-2 (107580),
and ETF.

MAPPING

By analysis of human-mouse hybrid cells, Kaneda et al. (1987) assigned
the MANB gene to chromosome 19p13.2-q12. By PCR analysis of DNA from 2
human/rodent somatic cell hybrid mapping panels, Nebes and Schmidt
(1994) mapped the MANB gene to the proximal portion of chromosome 19. In
combination with earlier findings, the gene could be mapped to
19cen-q12.

Beccari et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Man2b1 gene to chromosome 8 using
the Jackson Laboratory interspecific panel DNA.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 Palestinian sibs with alpha-mannosidosis (MANSA; 248500) originally
reported by Bach et al. (1978), Nilssen et al. (1997) identified a
homozygous mutation in the MAN2B1 gene (609458.0001).

In unrelated patients with alpha-mannosidosis, Gotoda et al. (1998)
identified 5 mutations in the MAN2B1 gene (609458.0001-609458.0005). All
mutations were either in the homozygous or compound heterozygous states.

In a screening of 43 patients with mannosidosis from 39 families, mainly
of European origin, Berg et al. (1999) identified 21 novel
disease-causing mutations in the MAN2B1 gene, and 4 polymorphic amino
acid variations. Disease-causing mutations were identified in 72% of the
patients' alleles and included 8 splicing, 6 missense, and 3 nonsense
mutations, as well as 2 small insertions and 2 small deletions. In
addition, Southern blot analysis indicated rearrangements in some
alleles. Most mutations were private or occurred in 2 or 3 families,
except for the R750W substitution (609458.0004), which was found in 13
patients from different European countries and accounted for 21% of the
disease alleles. No correlation between the types of mutations and the
clinical manifestations was evident.

Riise Stensland et al. (2012) identified 96 different pathogenic
mutations in the MAN2B1 gene, including 83 novel mutations, in 130
unrelated patients with alpha-mannosidosis from 30 countries. Most of
the mutations were private, but R750W was found in 50 patients from 16
countries and accounted for 27.3% of disease alleles. Haplotype analysis
indicated at least 4 independent events causing R750W, with 1 haplotype
accounting for 95% of the alleles. Population-based analysis suggested
that the mutant allele arose in eastern Europe. Other recurrent
mutations included a splice site mutation in intron 14 (609458.0006),
found in 13 disease alleles, and L809P (609458.0007), found in 8 disease
alleles. Twenty-nine novel missense mutations were identified. Most did
not show any residual enzyme activity when expressed in COS7 cells, but
10 showed some activity, including 5 with 30% or more residual activity.
There were no apparent genotype/phenotype correlations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Roces et al. (2004) reported correction of storage of neutral
oligosaccharides in a mouse model of alpha-mannosidosis after
intravenous administration of Man2b1 from bovine kidney and human and
mouse recombinant MAN2B1. The bovine and human enzymes were barely
phosphorylated, whereas the bulk of the mouse Man2b1 contained mannose
6-phosphate recognition markers. Clearance and apparent half-life of the
internalized enzyme was dependent on the enzyme source as well as tissue
type. The corrective effect was time-, tissue- and dose-dependent, and
the effects were observed to be transient. After a single dose injection
of MAN2B1, the maximum corrective effect was observed between 2 and 6
days. Injection of 250 microU of human MAN2B1 per gram of body weight
followed by a subsequent injection 3.5 days later was sufficient to
clear liver, kidney, and heart of neutral oligosaccharides. A decrease
in mannose-containing oligosaccharides was also observed in the brain,
with storage levels in treated mice less than 30% of levels found in
control mice.

Blanz et al. (2008) demonstrated that the neuropathology of a mouse
model for alpha-mannosidosis could be efficiently treated using
recombinant human alpha-mannosidase (rhLAMAN). After intravenous
administration of various doses (25-500 U/kg), rhLAMAN was widely
distributed among tissues, and immunohistochemistry revealed lysosomal
delivery of the injected enzyme. Whereas low doses (25 U/kg) led to a
greater than 70% clearance of stored substrates in visceral tissues and
doses of 250 U/kg were sufficient for clearance in peripheral neurons of
the trigeminal ganglion, repeated high-dose injections (500 U/kg) were
required to achieve a greater than 50% reduction of brain storage.
Successful transfer across the blood-brain barrier was evident as the
injected enzyme was found in hippocampal neurons, leading to nearly
complete disappearance of storage vacuoles. In addition, the decrease in
neuronal storage in the brain correlated with an improvement of the
neuromotor disabilities found in untreated alpha-mannosidosis mice.
Uptake of rhLAMAN seemed to be independent of mannose-6-phosphate
receptors, consistent with the low phosphorylation profile of the
enzyme.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, HIS71LEU

In 2 sibs with alpha-mannosidosis (MANSA; 248500), born of
consanguineous parents, Nilssen et al. (1997) identified a homozygous
212A-T transversion in exon 2 of the MANB gene, resulting in a
his71-to-leu (H71L) substitution. Residue his71 is conserved among
lysosomal alpha-mannosidases from several species. The sibs were thought
to be mildly affected and residual acidic alpha-mannosidase activity of
20% of normal was detected in the patient's fibroblasts, according to
the report of this family by Bach et al. (1978). Nevertheless, the
patients showed vacuolated leukocytes and fibroblasts consistent with
the disease phenotype. The authors suggested that mutant mannosidase
enzymes, even though containing residual activity upon testing at the
appropriate pH, may be mislocalized to nonlysosomal compartments and
therefore functionally inactive.

Gotoda et al. (1998) identified the same mutation, which they designated
HIS72LEU in keeping with the codon numbering system of Wakamatsu et al.
(1997). The patient, represented by cell line GM2051, was one of the
patients reported by Nilssen et al. (1997).

.0002
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, ARG760TER

In a 47-year-old Japanese woman with mannosidosis (248500), born to
first-cousin parents, Gotoda et al. (1998) identified a homozygous
C-to-T transition in exon 19 of the MAN2B1 gene, resulting in an
arg760-to-ter (R760X) substitution. The lysosomal alpha-mannosidase
activity of the peripheral leukocytes was decreased to less than 1% of
control values.

.0003
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, GLN639TER

In fibroblast cell lines from a 7-year-old Finnish boy with
alpha-mannosidosis (248500), who was originally described by Autio et
al. (1973), Gotoda et al. (1998) identified compound heterozygosity for
2 mutations in the MAN2B1 gene: a C-to-T transition in exon 15,
resulting in a gln639-to-ter (Q639X) substitution, and a C-to-T
transition in exon 18, resulting in an arg750-to-trp substitution
(R750W; 609458.0004). Alpha-mannosidase activity was reduced to
approximately 2% of normal.

.0004
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, ARG750TRP

See 609458.0003 and Gotoda et al. (1998).

Berg et al. (1999) identified the arg750-to-trp (R750W) mutation in 13
patients with alpha-mannosidosis (248500) from different European
countries. R750W accounted for 21% of disease alleles.

Riise Stensland et al. (2012) identified the R750W mutation in 50 of 130
unrelated patients with alpha-mannosidosis from 30 countries. It was the
most common mutation, accounting for 27.3% of disease alleles. Haplotype
analysis indicated at least 4 independent events causing R750W, with 1
haplotype accounting for 95% of the alleles. Population-based analysis
suggested that the mutant allele arose in eastern Europe. The mutation
was found in patients with mild, moderate, and severe disease.

.0005
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, PRO356ARG

In a fibroblast cell line from a 2-year-old girl with severe
alpha-mannosidosis (248500), Gotoda et al. (1998) identified a
homozygous C-to-T transversion in exon 8 of the MAN2B1 gene, resulting
in a pro356-to-arg (P356R) substitution. The patient showed severe
growth failure with hypotonia, psychomotor retardation, and
hepatosplenomegaly.

.0006
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, IVS14DS, G-C, +1

In a study of 130 unrelated patients with alpha-mannosidosis (248500)
from 30 countries, Riise Stensland et al. (2012) found that a G-to-C
transversion in intron 14 (IVS14+1G-C) of the MAN2B1 gene (Berg et al.,
1999) was present on 13 disease alleles, making it the second most
common mutation after R750W (609458.0004).

.0007
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, LEU809PRO

In a study of 130 unrelated patients with alpha-mannosidosis (248500)
from 30 countries, Riise Stensland et al. (2012) found that a 2426T-C
transition in exon 20 of the MAN2B1 gene (Berg et al., 1999) was present
on 8 disease alleles, making it the third most common mutation after
R750W (609458.0004) and a splice site mutation in intron 14
(609458.0006).

609867	TITLE *609867 UBIQUITIN-LIKE DOMAIN-CONTAINING CTD PHOSPHATASE 1; UBLCP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

During large-scale cDNA sequencing, Zheng et al. (2005) cloned a novel
phosphatase, which they named ubiquitin-like domain-containing CTD
phosphatase-1 (UBLCP1), from a human fetal brain cDNA library. UBLCP1
encodes a 318-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 36.8
kD. It has a CTD phosphatase catalytic domain containing several
residues essential for catalytic activity that are conserved with those
in the CTD phosphatases CTDSP1 (605323) and CTDP1 (604927). UBLCP1 also
contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain that harbors a
proteasome-interacting motif. RT-PCR detected relatively high expression
of UBLCP1 in placenta, lung, testis, and ovary, with weaker expression
in heart, liver, kidney, spleen, thymus, colon, and peripheral blood
leukocytes. UBLCP1 expression was particularly high in breast, lung,
colon, prostate, ovarian, and pancreas tumor tissues. Immunofluorescence
analysis localized UBLCP1 to the nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro phosphatase assays, Zheng et al. (2005) demonstrated that
UBLCP1 shows magnesium-dependent phosphatase activity towards the
substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate that is optimal at pH 5. In vitro
assays also showed that UBLCP1 dephosphorylates the C-terminal domain of
RNA polymerase II (180660), with highest activity at serine-5.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zheng et al. (2005) determined that the UBLCP1 gene contains 11 exons
spanning over 22.7 kb.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Zheng et al. (2005) mapped the UBLCP1 gene to
chromosome 5q33.3.

600442	TITLE *600442 AQUAPORIN 5; AQP5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Aquaporin water channels, such as AQP5, play a fundamental role in
transmembrane water movement in plant and animal tissues (see AQP1;
107776).

CLONING

Since the molecular pathway by which water is secreted by salivary
glands was unknown, Raina et al. (1995) isolated cDNA from rat
submandibular gland by homology cloning. In vitro translation yielded a
27-kD polypeptide, and expression of the cRNA in Xenopus oocytes
conferred a 20-fold increase in osmotic water permeability, which was
reversibly inhibited by HgCl(2). Northern blot analysis demonstrated a
1.6-kb mRNA in submandibular, parotid, and sublingual salivary glands,
lacrimal gland, eye, trachea, and lung. In situ hybridization
demonstrated strong hybridization over the corneal epithelium of the eye
and over the secretory lobules in salivary glands. This member of the
mammalian aquaporin water channel family, designated AQP5, was
implicated in the generation of saliva, tears, and pulmonary secretions.

Lee et al. (1996) isolated and characterized the human AQP5 cDNA and
gene. The AQP5 cDNA from a human submaxillary gland library contained a
795-bp open reading frame encoding a 265-amino acid polypeptide. The
deduced amino acid sequences of human and rat AQP5 are 91% identical,
with 6 substitutions in the 22-amino acid COOH-terminal domain. Lee et
al. (1996) identified a transcription initiation site 518 bp upstream of
the initiating methionine.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Lee et al. (1996) mapped the AQP5
gene to chromosome 12q13. The AQP5 gene resides within a 7.4-kb
SalI-EcoRI restriction fragment. The homologous mouse gene was localized
to distal chromosome 15.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (1996) showed that microinjection of human AQP5 in Xenopus
oocytes conferred mercurial-sensitive osmotic water permeability
equivalent to other aquaporins.

Tsubota et al. (2001) examined the distribution of AQP5 in lacrimal
gland biopsy specimens. Healthy controls and patients with either
Mikulicz disease or non-Sjogren syndrome dry eye had the expected apical
distribution of AQP5 in lacrimal acinar cells. Patients with Sjogren
syndrome, however, had diffuse cytoplasmic staining for AQP5, with
almost no labeling at the apical membrane. Sodium channel and
sodium-potassium ATPase distribution were normal in all groups. Tsubota
et al. (2001) concluded that there is a selective defect in lacrimal
gland AQP5 trafficking in Sjogren syndrome that might contribute to
decreased lacrimation and dry eye in these patients.

Sidhaye et al. (2006) observed a dose-responsive decrease in Aqp5
abundance in mouse lung epithelial cells exposed to hypotonic medium.
Hypotonic reduction of Aqp5 was augmented and reduced, respectively, by
conditions that activated or inhibited Trpv4 (605427). Hypotonic
reduction of Aqp5 required extracellular calcium and was associated with
increased intracellular calcium. The response to hypotonicity was
recapitulated by coexpression of TRPV4 and AQP5 in human embryonic
kidney cells. Sidhaye et al. (2006) concluded that AQP5 abundance is
tightly controlled along a spectrum of extracellular osmolalities and
that its abundance in hypotonic conditions can be regulated by TRPV4
activation.

By immunohistochemistry, Blaydon et al. (2013) observed strong
localization of AQP5 to the plasma membrane in keratinocytes of the
stratum granulosum. Levels of AQP5 in the palmar epidermis were much
lower than those seen in cells of the sweat glands.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using linkage data in combination with exome sequencing followed by
Sanger sequencing in families segregating autosomal dominant diffuse
nonepidermolytic PPK (PPKB; 600231), Blaydon et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for 5 different missense mutations in the AQP5 gene
(600442.0001-600442.0005) in affected members of 7 Swedish families, 3
British families, and a Scottish family. The mutations all segregated
with disease in the respective families and were not found in the dbSNP
or 1000 Genomes Project databases. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed
that the mutant AQP5 variants retained the ability to traffic to the
plasma membrane; the analyses also showed an increase in levels of
acetylated alpha-tubulin (see 602529) in a patient palm biopsy compared
to a control palm, suggesting increased levels of microtubule
stabilization in diffuse NEPPK palmar epidermis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ma et al. (2000) presented results from studies of Aqp5-null knockout
mice indicating that AQP5 is responsible for the majority of water
transport across the apical membrane of type I alveolar epithelial
cells. The unimpaired alveolar fluid clearance in Aqp5-null mice
indicated that high alveolar water permeability is not required for
active, near-isosmolar fluid transport. King et al. (2000) stated that 5
aquaporin-null phenotypes had been reported: AQP0, AQP1, AQP2, AQP4, and
AQP5.

Nejsum et al. (2002) studied the localization of AQPs 1 through 5 in rat
and mouse skin and sweat glands and investigated the potential roles of
AQPs in sweat secretion. The studies demonstrated that AQP5 resides in
plasma membranes of sweat secretory cells and is essential for sweat
secretion. Aqp5-null mice showed no apparent differences in the number
or morphologic appearance of sweat glands. However, these mice showed a
marked reduction in pilocarpine-induced sweat response. Nejsum et al.
(2002) raised the possibility that dysregulation of AQP5 in sweat glands
may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypohidrosis observed in patients
with Sjogren syndrome (270150) who show markedly decreased sweating in
response to methacholine stimulation. In contrast, hyperhidrosis
(144110) is a chronic idiopathic disorder of excessive sweating which
may affect the palms, axillae, soles, and face. They suggested that AQP5
inhibition may be a therapeutic option in these patients.

Two AQP water channels are expressed in mammalian cornea, AQP1 in
endothelial cells and AQP5 in epithelial cells. Thiagarajah and Verkman
(2002) examined the effect of Aqp1 or Aqp5 knockout in mice. Corneal
thickness in fixed sections was reduced in Aqp1 null mice and increased
in Aqp5 null mice. After exposure of the external corneal surface to
hypotonic saline, the rate of corneal swelling was reduced by Aqp5
deletion. After exposure of the endothelial surface to hypotonic saline
by anterior chamber perfusion, the rate of corneal swelling was reduced
by Aqp1 deletion. The recovery of corneal transparency and thickness
after hypotonic swelling was delayed in Aqp1 null mice. Thiagarajah and
Verkman (2002) concluded that AQP1 and AQP5 provide the principal routes
for corneal water transport across the endothelial and epithelial
barriers, respectively.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PALMOPLANTAR KERATODERMA, BOTHNIAN TYPE
AQP5, ALA38GLU

In affected individuals of 7 Swedish families with Bothnian-type diffuse
nonepidermolytic PPK (PPKB; 600231), including a family previously
studied by Lind et al. (1994), Blaydon et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a c.113C-A transversion in exon 1 of the AQP5 gene,
resulting in an ala38-to-glu (A38E) substitution at a residue located on
the extracellular surface of the protein. The mutation segregated with
disease in each family and was not found in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes
Project databases. Affected individuals carrying the A38E mutation all
shared the same haplotype, indicating that A38E represents a founder
mutation. In 1 of the Swedish families, however, most affected
individuals carried a different missense mutation in AQP5 (R188C;
600442.0002); the A38E founder mutation was present in only 1 branch of
the family and was inherited from an affected individual who married
into the family.

.0002
PALMOPLANTAR KERATODERMA, BOTHNIAN TYPE
AQP5, ARG188CYS

In affected individuals of a Swedish family with Bothnian-type diffuse
nonepidermolytic PPK (600231), Blaydon et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a c.562C-T transition in exon 3 of the AQP5 gene,
resulting in an arg188-to-cys (R188C) substitution at a highly conserved
residue lining the extracellular end of the water channel. The mutation,
which was not found in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes Project databases,
segregated with disease in most of the family. In 1 branch of the
family, however, affected individuals carried the A38E founder mutation
(600442.0001), which was inherited from an affected individual who
married into the family.

PALMOPLANTAR KERATODERMA, BOTHNIAN TYPE
AQP5, ILE45SER

In affected individuals of 2 families of British descent with
Bothnian-type diffuse nonepidermolytic PPK (600231), Blaydon et al.
(2013) identified heterozygosity for a c.134T-G transversion in exon 1
of the AQP5 gene, resulting in an ile45-to-ser (I45S) substitution at a
residue lining the extracellular end of the water channel. The mutation
segregated with disease in both families and was not found in the dbSNP
or 1000 Genomes Project databases.

.0004
PALMOPLANTAR KERATODERMA, BOTHNIAN TYPE
AQP5, ILE177PHE

In affected members of a large British family with Bothnian-type diffuse
nonepidermolytic PPK (600231), Blaydon et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a c.529A-T transversion in exon 3 of the AQP5 gene,
resulting in an ile177-to-phe (I177F) substitution at a residue lining
the extracellular end of the water channel. The mutation segregated with
disease in the family and was not found in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes
Project databases.

AQP5, ASN123ASP

In affected members of a family from Scotland with Bothnian-type diffuse
nonepidermolytic PPK (600231), Blaydon et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a c.367A-G transition in exon 2 of the AQP5 gene,
resulting in an asn123-to-asp (N123D) substitution at a residue located
on the extracellular surface of the protein. The mutation segregated
with disease in the family and was not found in the dbSNP or 1000
Genomes Project databases.

;;BNIP2-SIMILAR; BNIPS;;
BNIPL1;;
BNIPL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis using full-length BNIP2 (603292) or its BNIP2 and
CDC42GAP (ARHGAP1; 602732) homology (BCH) domain as probe, followed by
5-prime RACE of human kidney epithelial cells, Zhou et al. (2002) cloned
BNIPL, which they called BNIPS. They identified 2 alternative splicing
isoforms, a deduced 275-amino acid BNIPS-alpha isoform and a deduced
204-amino acid BNIPS-beta isoform. The BNIPS-alpha isoform shared 46%
identity with BNIP2 with higher similarity over the BCH domain, which is
predicted to comprise several alpha helices. PCR analysis detected
differing levels of expression of the BNIPS-alpha and BNIPS-beta
isoforms in a number of human cancer cell lines including breast cancer
MCF-7, HeLa cells, 293T embryonic transformed kidney epithelial cells,
and stomach and colon cancer cell lines. PCR analysis of mouse tissues
detected expression of BNIPS-alpha in all tissues examined.
Immunofluorescence studies localized the BNIPS-alpha isoform to the
cytosol and BNIPS-beta primarily to the nucleus.

Using a high-throughput transfection screen for suppressors of cell
growth from a human placental cDNA library, followed by 5-prime RACE,
Qin et al. (2003) independently cloned BNIPL. They identified 2
alternatively spliced isoforms that used different start codons: a
deduced 275-amino acid isoform, BNIPL1, isoform identical to the
BNIPS-alpha isoform isolated by Zhou et al. (2002) and a longer
357-amino acid isoform, BNIPL2, containing 82 additional N-terminal
amino acids, followed by the 275-amino acid sequence identical to
BNIPL1. By Northern blot analysis of human tissues, Shen et al. (2003)
detected a 2.4-kb BNIPL transcript in placenta and lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhou et al. (2002) showed that overexpression of the BNIPS-alpha isoform
in human breast cancer cells caused cell rounding, which was accompanied
by annexin V (ANXA5; 131230) binding, cell shrinkage, and detachment.
BNIPS-beta showed no change in cell morphology. The BCH domain was
required for proapoptotic activity. Zhou et al. (2002) concluded that
BNIPS-alpha induces apoptosis.

Using yeast 2-hybrid and pull-down affinity studies, Qin et al. (2003)
showed that the BCH domain of the BNIPL2 isoform interacted with Bcl2
(151430), Cdc42GAP, and with itself. They demonstrated that the BCH
domain was responsible for the ability of BNIPL2 to suppress GAP
activity of Cdc42GAP toward CDC42 (116952) and for the proapoptotic
function of BNIPL2. Shen et al. (2003) showed that overexpression of
BNIPL inhibited cell growth in human hepatocarcinoma cells. Using in
vivo and in vitro assays, they found that BNIPL interacted with MIF
(153620) and GFER (600924).

GENE STRUCTURE

Qin et al. (2003) determined that the BNIPL gene contains 10 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Qin et al. (2003) mapped the BNIPL gene to
chromosome 1q21.1.

;;NEUROTROPHIC TYROSINE KINASE RECEPTOR-RELATED 3; NTRKR3;;
TYROSINE KINASE RECEPTOR RELATED TO NEUROTROPHIC TRK; TKT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a PCR-mediated approach, Karn et al. (1993) characterized cDNAs
from human and mouse representing a novel type of receptor protein
tyrosine kinase (RTK). The deduced 855-amino acid sequence of the
longest ORF has a unique extracellular region encompassing a factor
VIII-like domain, not previously described for RTKs. The most closely
related RTKs are members of the neurotrophin receptors (TRKs; see TRKA,
191315), which show 47 to 49% homology with the kinase domain of the
novel RTK. Therefore, Karn et al. (1993) called the novel gene TKT
(pronounced 'ticket') for 'tyrosine-kinase related to TRK.' TKT
orthologs from man and mouse are 98% similar. Northern blot analysis
detected a 10-kb transcript that was highly expressed in heart and lung,
with lower expression in brain, placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, and
kidney. In mouse, highest expression was also detected in heart and
lung, with lower expression in brain and testis.

Using in situ hybridization with 1-week-old mice, Labrador et al. (2001)
found that Ddr2 was expressed along chondrocyte columns in the
proliferative region of the growth plate. Ddr2 mRNA was also present,
although dispersed, at areas of calcified cartilage in the
cartilage-bone junction, as well as in the trabecular bone surface. Ddr2
protein was detected in most mouse tissues examined. Highest levels of
phosphorylated Ddr2 were detected in lung, ovary, and skin, which did
not correlate with Ddr2 protein levels.

MAPPING

By analysis of human/mouse somatic cell hybrids using PCR with primers
that amplified human but not mouse genomic DNA, Karn et al. (1993)
demonstrated that the TKT gene segregates with human chromosome 1 and is
located in the region 1q12-qter.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bargal et al. (2009) mapped the short limb-hand type of
spondyloepiphyseal-metaphyseal dysplasia (SMED-SL; 271665) to a region
on chromosome 1 that included that DDR2 gene. They considered DDR2 to be
a strong candidate for the disorder because of the similarity between
the phenotype of the Ddr2 knockout mouse and that of SMED-SL patients.
In 8 patients from 7 different consanguineous families with SMED-SL,
they identified homozygous missense mutations in exon 17 of the DDR2
gene: an R752C substitution (191311.0001) in 6 Arab Muslims living in
the Jerusalem area, an I726R (191311.0002) substitution in 1 Algerian,
and a T713I (191311.0003) substitution in 1 Pakistani. Bargal et al.
(2009) also identified a splice site mutation (191311.0004) in the DDR2
gene, which resulted in the skipping of exon 17, in one of the Jewish
families with SMED-SL originally reported by Borochowitz et al. (1993).
All of the mutations occurred in the active site of the DDR2 tyrosine
kinase domain.

Ali et al. (2010) reported homozygous DDR2 missense mutations in 2
consanguineous families with SMED-SL in the United Arab Emirates. One
was a novel mutation (E113K; 191311.0005) in 2 sibs from a family of
Pakistani origin, and the other the R752C mutation (191311.0001) in 2
Egyptian sibs. The authors expressed DDR2 constructs with the identified
point mutations in human cell lines and evaluated their localization and
functional properties. All SMED-SL missense mutants were defective in
collagen-induced receptor activation, and the 3 missense mutations
reported by Bargal et al. (2009) were retained in the endoplasmic
reticulum. In contrast, the novel mutation trafficked normally but
failed to bind collagen.

ANIMAL MODEL

Labrador et al. (2001) obtained Ddr2 -/- mice at the expected mendelian
ratio. Ddr2 -/- mice appeared normal at birth, but they failed to
thrive, resulting in proportionate smaller body size and reduced body
mass. They developed a progressive skeletal phenotype characterized by
shortening of long bones, irregular growth of flat bones, and shorter
snout. Reduced bone growth in Ddr2 -/- mice appeared to be due to
reduced chondrocyte proliferation rather than apoptosis or a defect in
chondrocyte differentiation. Ddr2 -/- embryonic fibroblasts and Ddr2 -/-
adult skin fibroblasts proliferated more slowly and showed a diminished
wounding response compared with wildtype fibroblasts.

In 6 patients with the short limb-hand type of spondylometaepiphyseal
dysplasia (271665) from 5 Arab Muslim families living in the Jerusalem
area, Bargal et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for a 2254C-T
transition in exon 17 of the DDR2 gene, resulting in an arg752-to-cys
(R752C) substitution. All of the parents were heterozygous for the
mutation, which was not found in 200 chromosomes of matched healthy
unrelated individuals. Haplotype analysis indicated that this is a
founder mutation.

Ali et al. (2010) found that the 2 affected sibs from the consanguineous
Egyptian family originally reported by Al-Gazali et al. (1996) carried
the R752C mutation in homozygosity. Both sibs died, one of respiratory
failure at age 13 years and the other of cord compression at age 8
years. In severity the phenotype was similar to the patients described
by Bargal et al. (2009).

Ali et al. (2010) expressed R752C mutant protein in human cells and
found that it was retained in endoplasmic reticulum and was defective in
collagen-induced receptor activation.

for a 2177T-G transversion in exon 17 of the DDR2 gene, resulting in an
ile726-to-arg (I726R) substitution. The parents were heterozygous for
the mutation, which was not found in 200 chromosomes of matched healthy
unrelated individuals.

Ali et al. (2010) expressed I726R mutant protein in human cells and
found that it was retained in endoplasmic reticulum and was defective in

for a 2138C-T transition in exon 17 of the DDR2 gene, resulting in a
thr713-to-ile (T713I) substitution. The parents were heterozygous for
the mutation, which was not found in 200 chromosomes of matched healthy
unrelated individuals.

Ali et al. (2010) expressed T713I mutant protein in human cells and
found that it was retained in endoplasmic reticulum and was defective in
collagen-induced receptor activation.

.0004
SPONDYLOMETAEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, SHORT LIMB-HAND TYPE
DDR2, IVS17, G-A, +1

In the parents of the affected members of one of the original
consanguineous Jewish families with spondylometaepiphyseal dysplasia,
short limb-hand type (271665), described by Borochowitz et al. (1993),
Bargal et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for an IVS17+1G-A
mutation in the DDR2 gene, which resulted in the skipping of exon 17.

.0005
SPONDYLOMETAEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, SHORT LIMB-HAND TYPE
DDR2, GLU113LYS

In 2 brothers from a consanguineous Pakistani family with
spondylometaepiphyseal dysplasia, short limb-hand type (271665), Ali et
al. (2010) detected homozygosity for a c.337G-A transition in DDR2
resulting in a glu-to-lys substitution at codon 113 (E113K). The E113K
mutation is located in the extracellular discoidin domain and affects a
surface-exposed residue important in the DDR2 collagen-binding site. The
brothers had bowing of lower limbs in addition to short limbs and hands.
Both had repeated respiratory infections. Neurologic development was
normal in both.

Ali et al. (2010) expressed E113K mutant protein in human cells and
found that, while it trafficked normally, it was defective in
collagen-induced receptor activation and failed to bind collagen.

USH3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching and sequencing of the Usher syndrome type IIIA
(276902) critical region on chromosome 3q21-q25, Joensuu et al. (2001)
identified several genes, including CLRN1, which they called USH3A gene.
The USH3A protein has a cytosolic N terminus, 2 helical transmembrane
domains, and an endoplasmic reticulum membrane retention signal, TKGH,
in the C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression
of 3 USH3A transcripts of 4.5 kb, 1.4 kb, and 2.0 kb in adult human
tissues. RT-PCR analysis detected expression in retina. No expression of
USH3A was detected in human lymphoblasts by either method.

Fields et al. (2002) found that the USH3A gene encodes a deduced
232-amino acid protein. The mature form of the protein is predicted to
contain 3 transmembrane domains and 204 residues.

Adato et al. (2002) assembled a 500-kb genomic interval spanning the
USH3A gene and determined the full-length coding sequence of the USH3A
gene, expected to encode a 232-amino acid protein with 4 transmembrane
domains, which they named clarin-1. Adato et al. (2002) detected
expression of USH3A in retina, skeletal muscle, testis, and olfactory
epithelium. In mouse inner ear, expression was specific to the inner and
outer hair cells of the organ of Corti and to the spiral ganglion cells.

By sequencing CLRN1 clones obtained from a human retina cDNA library,
Vastinsalo et al. (2011) identified 10 alternative splice variants in
addition to the main variant, which contains exons 0, 2, and 3 and
encodes a 232-amino acid protein. Other transcripts containing ORFs were
predicted to encode proteins of 30 to 245 amino acids, and all but the
30-amino acid peptide have 1 to 4 transmembrane segments. Some splice
variants include premature stop codons and may be untranslated. EST
database analysis suggested that exon 2 may also be spliced onto
additional downstream exons. PCR analysis detected weak expression of
the main CLRN1 variant in most tissues examined. The variant encoding
the 245-amino acid protein was detected in retina, cochlea, heart,
brain, placenta, lung, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and ovary.

GENE STRUCTURE

Joensuu et al. (2001) determined that the CLRN1 gene contains 4 exons
spanning approximately 18 kb of genomic DNA. They also identified a
splice variant, designated isoform b, comprising an additional 87-bp
exon (exon 1b).

Fields et al. (2002) provided a revised structure of the CLRN1 gene,
including a new translation start site, 5-prime untranslated region, and
a transcript encoding a 232-amino acid protein. They stated that no
portion of exon 1, exon 1b, or exon 4 was present in their revised CLRN1
cDNA.

Adato et al. (2002) determined the genomic structure and alternative
transcripts of the CLRN1 gene. A longer transcript than those reported
by Joensuu et al. (2001) began with a newly identified exon 0, continued
with exon 2, had exons 3 and 4 transcribed together with their
intervening intron, but did not include the previously identified exons
1 and 1b.

Vastinsalo et al. (2011) determined that the CLRN1 gene contains at
least 8 exons, which they termed exons 0, 0b, 1, 1b, 2, 2b, 3a, and 3b.
Exons 3a and 3b are joined, along with the intervening intron, to form
exon 3 in the main splice variant. The region upstream of exon 1, which
is not transcribed in the main variant, contains a CpG island. Regions
upstream of exons 0, 1, 2, and 3 contain putative transcription
factor-binding sites. Functional analysis revealed that highest promoter
activity was associated with the region upstream of exon 0. A
pseudogene, CLRN1OS, is located on the opposite strand and has a 5-prime
UTR running in the opposite direction and overlapping the 5-prime UTR of
the CLRN1 gene.

GENE FAMILY

Adato et al. (2002) performed sequence database searches and identified
2 additional clarin-1 human paralogs: clarin-2 and clarin-3. No
orthologs were identified in the genomes of prokaryotes, yeast, plants,
nematodes, and insects, suggesting that this gene family is limited to
vertebrates. Four transmembrane domains, conserved sequence motifs, and
a single glycosylation consensus site between TM1 and TM2 characterized
the clarin family members, with a total of 14 identified clarins in
different species. In a wider context the clarins appeared to belong to
a large superfamily of small integral membrane glycoproteins with 4
transmembrane domains, including connexins and claudins, previously
shown to be involved in forms of deafness. The only protein showing
significant sequence similarity to the 3 clarins was stargazin, a
cellular synapse protein encoded by the CACNG2 gene (602911). Because of
the sequence homology to stargazin, Adato et al. (2002) suggested a role
for clarin-1 in hair cell and photoreceptor cell synapses.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Joensuu et al. (2001) mapped the CLRN1 gene to
chromosome 3q21-q25. Fields et al. (2002) stated 3q25 as the cytogenetic
location of the CLRN1 gene.

Fields et al. (2002) showed that the orthologous gene in the mouse is on
chromosome 3 and in rat on chromosome 2. They identified 2 human
paralogs on chromosomes 4 and 10.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Usher Syndrome Type IIIA

In 2 Finnish families reported by Sankila et al. (1995) and Joensuu et
al. (1996) and an Italian family reported by Gasparini et al. (1998)
with Usher syndrome type IIIA (276902), Joensuu et al. (2001) identified
mutations in the USH3A gene (606397.0001-606397.0003).

Fields et al. (2002) described 4 novel disease-causing mutations in the
USH3A gene, including one that appeared to be relatively common in the
Ashkenazi Jewish population (N48K; 606937.0004).

Adato et al. (2002) detected 3 USH3A mutations among 11 affected
individuals from 6 families with Usher syndrome type IIIA. They were a
missense mutation (606397.0004), a nonsense mutation (606397.0006), and
a 23-bp deletion (606397.0007), likely rendering clarin-1 functionally
inactive.

Aller et al. (2004) screened for mutations in the USH3A gene in Spanish
patients with Usher syndrome and found mutations in only 2 families.
They identified 1 patient with Usher syndrome type IIIA who was
homozygous for a C40G mutation (606397.0008). They noted that only 1
other mutation had been reported in the USH3A gene in Spanish families
with Usher syndrome (606397.0006). These 2 families accounted for only
1.7% of Spanish families with Usher syndrome.

- Retinitis Pigmentosa 61

In affected members of 2 consanguineous Pakistani families segregating
nonsyndromic autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP61; 614180),
Khan et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for missense mutations in the
CLRN1 gene (606397.0009-606397.0010), both of which occurred in a
transmembrane domain. Khan et al. (2011) concluded that these
RP-associated mutations might represent hypomorphic mutations, because
the substituted amino acids located in the transmembrane domains
remained polar, whereas more severe changes had been detected in
patients with USH3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Geng et al. (2009) developed a Clrn1 -/- mouse model for Usher syndrome
type IIIA. Clrn1 was expressed as early as embryonic day 16.5 in the
auditory and vestibular hair cells and associated ganglionic neurons,
with its expression being higher in outer hair cells than inner hair
cells. Clrn1 -/- mice showed early-onset hearing loss that rapidly
progressed to severe levels. Two to 3 weeks after birth (postnatal day
14 to 21), Clrn1-null mice showed elevated auditory-evoked brainstem
response (ABR) thresholds and prolonged peak and interpeak latencies. By
postnatal day 21, approximately 70% of Clrn1-null mice had no detectable
ABR, and by postnatal day 30, these mice were deaf. Distortion product
otoacoustic emissions were not recordable from Clrn1-null mice.
Vestibular function in Clrn1-null mice mirrored the cochlear phenotype,
although it deteriorated more gradually than cochlear function.
Disorganization of outer hair cell stereocilia was seen as early as
postnatal day 2 and by postnatal day 21 outer hair cell loss was
observed. Geng et al. (2009) concluded that CLRN1 is necessary for hair
cell function and associated neural activation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, TYR176TER

Fields et al. (2002) demonstrated that the Fin(major) USH3A mutation in
exon 3 of the USH3A gene, which had been identified by Joensuu et al.
(2001) as 300C-T (TYR100TER), should be referred to as 528T-G, resulting
in a tyr176-to-ter substitution. Joensuu et al. (2001) had identified
homozygosity for this mutation in a Finnish family segregating Usher
syndrome type IIIA (276902) and found it in a further 52 Finnish
patients. Fields et al. (2002) found this mutation in 11 of 28 mutated
alleles from affected individuals of Finnish and other northern European
ancestry.

.0002
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, MET120LYS

In 4 Finnish patients from 2 families segregating Usher syndrome type
IIIA (276902), Joensuu et al. (2001) identified heterozygosity for the
Fin(major) mutation (606397.0001) and a T-to-A transversion resulting in
a met-to-lys substitution. Whereas Joensuu et al. (2001) referred to
this mutation, designated Fin(minor), as 131T-A (MET44LYS), Fields et
al. (2002) showed that this mutation should be referred to as 359T-A
(met120 to lys; M120K). The mutation occurred in exon 1 of the USH3A
gene.

.0003
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, 3-BP DEL, 459ATT

In a consanguineous Italian family segregating Usher syndrome type IIIA
(276902), Joensuu et al. (2001) identified a 3-bp deletion in exon 3 of
the USH3A gene, resulting in the substitution of one methionine for
isoleucine and leucine. Fields et al. (2002) showed that this mutation,
referred to as 231-233delATT by Joensuu et al. (2001), should be
referred to as 459-461delATT.

.0004
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, ASN48LYS

Of a total of 28 mutated alleles of the USH3A gene detected by Fields et
al. (2002) in patients with Usher syndrome type IIIA (276902), 11 had a
missense mutation, asn48 to lys (N48K), due to a 144T-G transversion in
exon 1. The mutation occurred only in Ashkenazi Jewish subjects and was
present in homozygous state in all except 1, in whom it was found in
compound heterozygous state with a leu150-to-pro mutation (L150P;
606397.0005).

Adato et al. (2002) detected the N48K missense mutation in 6 affected
individuals from 4 unrelated families of Eastern European Jewish origin.
Five patients were homozygous, while 1 patient carried the substitution
only on 1 allele and the second USH3A mutation was not detected. Shared
microsatellite and SNP haplotypes on carrier chromosomes suggested the
existence of a founder effect for this mutation.

In a cohort of 40 Ashkenazi Jewish patients with Usher syndrome, Ness et
al. (2003) found that the 16 (40%) who were clinically classified as
having Usher syndrome type III were homozygous for the N48K mutation.
The carrier frequency of N48K was 0.7% (95% CI = 0.0-1.6%) among
Ashkenazi Jews in the New York area, with a predicted Usher syndrome
type III prevalence of 1.2 per 100,000. Despite the genetic homogeneity
of Usher syndrome type III in this group, there was a wide range of
phenotypic severity displayed by the N48K homozygotes. Age at onset of
the auditory phenotype varied from infancy to more than 35 years. A
56-year-old woman had onset of the ocular phenotype in early childhood
ending with no useful vision, whereas hearing loss began after age 35
years, progressing to moderate to severe.

.0005
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, LEU150PRO

In an Ashkenazi Jewish subject with type IIIA Usher syndrome (276902)
who was living in the United States, Fields et al. (2002) found that the
common Jewish mutation asn48 to lys (606397.0004) was combined, in
compound heterozygous state, with a 449T-C transition in exon 3,
resulting in a leu150-to-pro (L150P) mutation.

.0006
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, TYR63TER

Adato et al. (2002) detected a 189C-A substitution, which was expected
to cause a tyr63-to-ter (Y63X) nonsense mutation in homozygous state in
3 sibs with Usher syndrome type IIIA (276902) from a nonconsanguineous
Spanish family.

Aller et al. (2004) stated that the family with the Y63X mutation
reported by Adato et al. (2002) could be diagnosed clinically as Usher
syndrome type I because hearing impairment was profound and stable.
Aller et al. (2004) considered that progressive hearing loss is not the
definitive parameter in distinguishing Usher syndrome type III from
Usher syndrome types I and II.

.0007
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, 23-BP DEL, NT187

In 2 sibs with Usher syndrome type IIIA (276902) from a
nonconsanguineous family of Yemenite Jewish origin, Adato et al. (2002)
detected a 23-bp deletion in homozygous state. The deletion spanned
nucleotides 187-209 downstream from the first methionine codon, and was
predicted to cause a frameshift at amino acid 63 and stop codon after 25
amino acids.

.0008
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, CYS40GLY

In a patient with type IIIA Usher syndrome, Aller et al. (2004)
identified homozygosity for a 118T-G transversion, resulting in a
cys40-to-gly (C40G) mutation in the USH3A gene. Both parents and an
unaffected sister were heterozygous for the mutation.

.0009
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 61
CLRN1, LEU154TRP

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with
nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP61; 614180), Khan et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 461T-G transversion in exon 3 of the CLRN1
gene, resulting in a leu154-to-trp (L154W) substitution in a
transmembrane domain. Subcellular localization studies demonstrated
retention of the mutant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas
the wildtype protein was mainly present at the cell membrane. The
mutation was not found in 81 unrelated Pakistani RP patients or in 90
ethnically matched control individuals.

.0010
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 61
CLRN1, PRO31LEU

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with
nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP61; 614180), Khan et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 92C-T transition in exon 1 of the CLRN1
gene, resulting in a pro31-to-leu (P31L) substitution in a transmembrane
domain. Subcellular localization studies demonstrated retention of the
mutant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the wildtype
protein was mainly present at the cell membrane. The mutation was not
found in 81 unrelated Pakistani RP patients or in 90 ethnically matched
control individuals.

185880	TITLE *185880 VESICLE-ASSOCIATED MEMBRANE PROTEIN 1; VAMP1
;;SYNAPTOBREVIN 1; SYB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Synaptobrevins 1 and 2 (185881) are small integral membrane proteins
specific for synaptic vesicles in neurons.

CLONING

Archer et al. (1990) isolated and characterized cosmid clones containing
the human genes encoding synaptobrevins 1 and 2. Their coding regions
are highly homologous, being interrupted at identical positions by
introns of different size and sequence.

GENE STRUCTURE

The genes encoding synaptobrevins 1 and 2 have 5 exons whose boundaries
correspond to those of the protein domains (Archer et al., 1990). Exon 1
contains part of the initiator methionine codon, whereas exon 2 encodes
the variable and immunogenic amino-terminal domain. The third exon
comprises the highly conserved central domain, exon 4 encodes most of
the transmembrane region, and exon 5 contains the last residues of the
transmembrane region and the small intravesicular carboxyl terminus.

GENE FUNCTION

Neuronal exocytosis is triggered by calcium and requires 3 SNARE
proteins: synaptobrevin on the synaptic vesicle, and syntaxin (e.g.,
186590) and SNAP25 (600322) on the plasma membrane. Neuronal SNARE
proteins form a parallel 4-helix bundle that is thought to drive the
fusion of opposing membranes. Hu et al. (2002) demonstrated that whereas
syntaxin and SNAP25 in target membranes are freely available for SNARE
complex formation, availability of synaptobrevin on synaptic vesicles is
very limited. Calcium at micromolar concentrations triggers SNARE
complex formation and fusion between synaptic vesicles and reconstituted
target membranes. Although calcium does promote interaction of SNARE
proteins between opposing membranes, it does not act by releasing
synaptobrevin from synaptic vesicle restriction. Hu et al. (2002)
concluded that their data suggests a mechanism in which
calcium-triggered membrane apposition enables syntaxin and SNAP25 to
engage synaptobrevin, leading to membrane fusion.

Tucker et al. (2004) investigated the effect of synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1;
185605) on membrane fusion mediated by neuronal SNARE proteins SNAP25,
syntaxin, and synaptobrevin, which were reconstituted into vesicles. In
the presence of calcium, the cytoplasmic domain of SYT1 strongly
stimulated membrane fusion when synaptobrevin densities were similar to
those found in native synaptic vesicles. The calcium dependence of
SYT1-stimulated fusion was modulated by changes in lipid composition of
the vesicles and by a truncation that mimics cleavage of SNAP25 by
botulinum neurotoxin A. Stimulation of fusion was abolished by
disrupting the calcium-binding activity, or by severing the tandem C2
domains, of SYT1. Thus, SYT1 and SNAREs are likely to represent the
minimal protein complement for calcium-triggered exocytosis.

By use of the large calyx of Held presynaptic terminal from rats, Sakaba
et al. (2005) demonstrated that cleavage of different SNARE proteins by
clostridial neurotoxins caused distinct kinetic changes in
neurotransmitter release. When elevating calcium ion concentration
directly at the presynaptic terminal with the use of caged calcium,
cleavage of SNAP25 by botulinum toxin A produced a strong reduction in
the calcium sensitivity for release, whereas cleavage of syntaxin using
botulinum toxin C1 and synaptobrevin using tetanus toxin produced an all
or nothing block without changing the kinetics of remaining vesicles.
When stimulating release by calcium influx through channels, a
difference between botulinum toxin C1 and tetanus toxin emerged, which
suggests that cleavage of synaptobrevin modifies the coupling between
channels and release-competent vesicles.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids, Archer et al.
(1990) assigned the SYB1 gene to 12p; by analysis of DNA from Chinese
hamster-mouse somatic cell hybrids, they mapped the Syb1 gene to mouse
chromosome 6.

ANIMAL MODEL

The 'lethal-wasting' (lew) mouse is a spontaneous autosomal recessive
mutant that manifests as a neurologic phenotype characterized by
generalized lack of movement, wasting and prewean death by age 15 days.
By positional cloning, Nystuen et al. (2007) determined that the lew
phenotype results from a 190G-T transversion in the coding region of the
Vamp1 gene, predicted to result in truncation of nearly half of the
protein. Western blot analysis showed no detectable Vamp1 protein in
mutant mice. The authors noted that the phenotype was milder than that
of Vamp2 (185881)-null mice, which die at birth. By immunostudies of
normal mice, Nystuen et al. (2007) showed that Vamp1 is expressed
primarily in certain neuronal tissues, including the retina and areas of
the diencephalon and midbrain such as the zona incerta (subthalamus) and
rostral periolivary region. The findings suggested that Vamp1 has a
vital role in a subset of central nervous system tissues.

611088	TITLE *611088 COILED-COIL DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 65; CCDC65
;;NYD-SP28
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CCDC65 is a sperm tail protein that is posttranslationally modified
during sperm capacitation (Zheng et al., 2006).

CLONING

By differential display of genes upregulated in human adult versus fetal
testis, Zheng et al. (2006) cloned CCDC65, which they called NYD-SP28.
The deduced 484-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 57
kD and contains 2 potential sites for N-glycosylation, 2 for
N-myristoylation, and many potential phosphorylation sites. Western blot
analysis detected high CCDC65 expression in adult human testis, but no
detectable expression in fetal testis. Immunohistochemical studies of
CCDC65 expression in spermatozoa detected protein primarily in the
spermatocyte and spermatid, with weak expression in spermatogonia and no
signal in Leydig cells. Immunofluorescence analysis detected CCDC65
throughout the entire sperm tail in human noncapacitated, capacitated,
and acrosome-reacted spermatozoa. Using 2-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis
of proteins from human noncapacitated and capacitated sperm extracts,
Zheng et al. (2006) concluded that CCDC65 is posttranslationally
modified during capacitation. Transfection experiments in 7721 cells
localized CCDC65 to the cytoplasm.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zheng et al. (2006) determined that the CCDC65 gene contains 8 exons
spanning more than 17 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zheng et al. (2006) mapped the CCDC65 gene
to chromosome 12q13.12.

GENE FUNCTION

Austin-Tse et al. (2013) noted that the Chlamydomonas CCDC65 ortholog
Fap250 is a subunit of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC). The
Chlamydomonas ida6 motility mutant with inner arm dynein defects was
rescued by transformation with Fap250, and a causative mutation was
identified in the Fab250/Ccdc65 gene. Analysis of isolated ida6 axonemes
showed defects in the assembly of both the inner dynein arms and the
N-DRC. These data, together with the predicted size of the FAP250
polypeptide, strongly suggested that FAP250 corresponds to the DRC2
subunit of N-DRC and that DRC2/FAP250/CCDC65 plays a critical role in
the assembly of the N-DRC.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 Ashkenazi Jewish patients, including 2 brothers, with primary
ciliary dyskinesia-27 (CILD27; 615504), Austin-Tse et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous truncating mutation in the CCDC65 gene
(611088.0001). The patients were ascertained from a larger cohort of 295
individuals with CILD. The patients had recurrent bronchitis, sinusitis,
and/or otitis media, but no situs inversus. Fertility status could not
be ascertained. Cilia ultrastructure showed normal outer dynein arms,
radial spokes, and central pairs, but there was a reduction in inner
dynein arms and nexin links. Microtubule disorganization was also
observed in 5 to 15% of cilia cross sections, suggesting that the
reduction in nexin links may lead to overall structural instability in a
subset of cilia. Live imaging of patient nasal epithelial cilia showed a
stiff, dyskinetic cilia waveform.

ANIMAL MODEL

Austin-Tse et al. (2013) found that morpholino knockdown of the CCDC65
gene in zebrafish resulted in a strong ciliopathy phenotype, including
pronephric cysts, axis curvature, left-right asymmetry defects, and
hydrocephalus. Immunostaining for certain ciliary proteins did not
detect structural abnormalities, and ultrastructure analysis showed that
the outer dynein arms were not missing. High-speed video microscopy
showed stiff, dyskinetic cilia, consistent with a motility defect.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 27, WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS
CCDC65, 2-BP DEL, 877AT

In 2 brothers of Ashkenazi Jewish descent with primary ciliary
dyskinesia-27 without situs inversus (CILD27; 615504), Austin-Tse et al.
(2013) identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion (877delAT) in exon 6 of the
CCDC65 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination
(Ile293ProfsTer2). An unrelated girl of Ashkenazi Jewish descent was
also found to be homozygous for the mutation; her unaffected parents
were heterozygous for the mutation. The patients had recurrent
bronchitis, sinusitis, and/or otitis media. Fertility status could not
be ascertained. Cilia ultrastructure showed normal outer dynein arms,
radial spokes, and central pairs, but there was a reduction in inner
dynein arms and nexin links. Microtubule disorganization was also
observed in 5 to 15% of cilia cross sections, suggesting that the
reduction in nexin links may lead to overall structural instability in a
subset of cilia. Live imaging of patient nasal epithelial cilia showed a
stiff, dyskinetic cilia waveform.

609511	TITLE *609511 ZINC FINGER FYVE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 20; ZFYVE20
;;RABENOSYN 5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a gel overlay assay, Nielsen et al. (2000) identified ZFYVE20,
which they called rabenosyn-5, as a protein that directly interacts with
RAB5 (179512). By peptide analysis, EST database analysis, and PCR of a
HeLa cell cDNA library, they cloned rabenosyn-5 cDNA. The deduced
784-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal C2H2-type zinc finger
domain, a central FYVE finger domain, and 5 copies of the amino acid
motif NPF at its C terminus. SDS-PAGE showed rabenosyn-5 with an
apparent molecular mass of 110 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Nielsen et al. (2000) determined that rabenosyn-5 colocalized with EEA1
(605070) on RAB5-positive endosomes in HeLa cells. Recruitment of
rabenosyn-5 and EEA1 was dependent upon phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(see 601232). Mutation analysis indicated that the FYVE domain of
rabenosyn-5 was required for endosome targeting. Rabenosyn-5 was
complexed with the Sec1-like protein VPS45 (VPS45A; 610035), and
rabenosyn-5 appeared to serve as a molecular link between VPS45 and
RAB5. Both EEA1 and rabenosyn-5 were required for early endosomal
fusion, but only rabenosyn-5 overexpression inhibited processing of
procathepsin D (116840) to its 47-kD intermediate, suggesting that the 2
proteins play distinct roles in endosomal trafficking.

By immunofluorescence microscopy of HeLa cells, Naslavsky et al. (2004)
detected rabenosyn-5 partly colocalized with EHD1 (605888) in vesicular
and tubular structures. Depletion of either EHD1 or rabenosyn-5 in HeLa
cells by RNA interference (RNAi) delayed recycling of transferrin
(190000) and its receptor (TFRC; 190010), as well as major
histocompatibility complex class I (see HLA-A; 142800), to the plasma
membrane. Depletion of EHD1 caused accumulation of internalized cargo in
a compact juxtanuclear compartment, but depletion of rabenosyn-5 caused
retention of cargo within a dispersed peripheral compartment.
Simultaneous depletion of both rabenosyn-5 and EHD1 resulted in a
phenotype similar to that observed with rabenosyn-5 RNAi alone,
suggesting that rabenosyn-5 acts before EHD1 in the regulation of
endocytic recycling. Naslavsky et al. (2004) concluded that rabenosyn-5
and EHD1 act sequentially in the transport of proteins from early
endosomes to the endosomal recycling compartment and back to the plasma
membrane.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Using a structural proteomic approach, Eathiraj et al. (2005) determined
the specificity and structural basis underlying the interaction of the
multivalent effector rabenosyn-5 with the Rab family. The results
demonstrated that even the structurally similar effector domains in
rabenosyn-5 can achieve highly selective recognition of distinct subsets
of Rab GTPases exclusively through interactions with the switch and
interswitch regions. The observed specificity is determined at a
family-wide level by structural diversity in the active conformation,
which governs the spatial disposition of critical conserved recognition
determinants, and by a small number of both positive and negative
sequence determinants that allow further discrimination between Rab
GTPases with similar switch conformations.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ZFYVE20
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP STS-N59228).

612212	TITLE *612212 PLASMINOGEN-LIKE A; PLGLA
;;PLASMINOGEN-RELATED GENE A; PRGA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using primers based on PRGB (PLGLB1; 173340) for PCR amplification of
placental genomic DNA, Lewis et al. (1999) cloned PLGLA, which they
called PRGA. The deduced 96-amino peptide has a signal sequence followed
by a 77-amino acid stretch that is identical to the N terminus of
plasminogen (PLG; 173350) and differs from the homologous PRGB sequence
at only 4 positions. Northern blot analysis using a probe that did not
differentiate between PRGA and PRGB detected PRG only in liver and in a
lymphoblastic leukemia cell line.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lewis et al. (1999) determined that the PLGLA gene contains 4 coding
exons.

Kida et al. (1997) characterized the 5-prime flanking region of the
human PLGLA gene and found 3 TATA boxes 550 to 600 bp upstream of the
transcription initiation site, a TATA-like sequence (TGTAA) at position
-16, and putative binding sites for several transcription factors. The
1.1-kb 5-prime flanking sequence directed basal liver-specific
expression in HepG2 cells, and deletion analysis identified 2 negative
elements in the PLGLA promoter.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PLGLA
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP D2S2643)

600641	TITLE *600641 SULFOTRANSFERASE FAMILY 1A, PHENOL-PREFERRING, MEMBER 3; SULT1A3
;;SULFOTRANSFERASE, MONOAMINE-PREFERRING; STM
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sulfate conjugation is a key metabolic process controlled by a number of
genes. These include STD (125263), the dehydroepiandrosterone
(DHEA)-preferring sulfotransferase; STE (600043), the
estrogen-preferring form; STP1 (171150) and STP2 (601292), the
phenol-preferring forms; and STM, the monoamine-preferring form. STM,
the thermolabile or monoamine-metabolizing form of phenol
sulfotransferase, is responsible for the sulfate conjugation of
monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine, over 95% of which is
sulfate conjugated (Aksoy and Weinshilboum, 1995).

CLONING

Zhu et al. (1993) and Wood et al. (1994) cloned the STM cDNA from brain
and liver libraries, respectively. The same cDNA was later isolated by
Jones et al. (1995). The 3 sequences were in agreement and predicted a
295-amino acid protein.

Aksoy et al. (1994) expressed the STM cDNA in COS-1 cells as a 35.5-kD
protein. Northern blots showed a 1.4-kb mRNA in liver, kidney, lung,
small intestine, spleen and leukocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Aksoy and Weinshilboum (1995) determined that the STM gene has a total
length of approximately 8.4 kb and includes 10 exons, the first 3 of
which are untranslated. Many of the exon-intron borders are at the same
positions as in the human DHEA sulfotransferase gene. The first 2 exons
are present in the 5-prime UTR of a longer mRNA expressed in brain and
liver, while exon 3 is present in the 5-prime UTR of a shorter mRNA also
present in these tissues.

Dooley and Huang (1996) determined the genomic organization of the human
STP1, STP2, and STM genes. These 3 genes each have 8 exons with the
initiator methionine on exon 2. All 3 colocalize on a single cosmid from
chromosome 16p12.1-p11.2 and have a high degree of sequence homology,
suggesting that these 3 genes arose by gene duplication. Dooley and
Huang (1996) stated that the previously identified PST gene sequences
HAST3 and M-PST are isolates of the STM gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Weinshilboum et al. (1997) reviewed the molecular biology of the
sulfotransferases. These enzymes catalyze sulfate conjugation of many
hormones, neurotransmitters, drugs, and xenobiotic compounds. They
stated that at that time the 5 known human cytosolic sulfotransferases
were STE (symbolized EST by them), a hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase
STD, and 3 phenol-preferring sulfotransferases (STP1, STP2, and STM).
The genes for these human enzymes, as well as those of other mammalian
cytosolic sulfotransferases that had been cloned, showed a high degree
of structural homology, with conservation of location of most
intron-exon splice junctions. Genetic polymorphisms of several of these
that have been demonstrated through family studies are suspected on the
basis of large differences among individuals in the expression.

MAPPING

Aksoy et al. (1994) used PCR screening of DNAs from human-rodent somatic
cell hybrid mapping panels to assign the STM gene to chromosome 16.
Regional localization to 16p11.2 was achieved by PCR analysis of a
high-resolution mouse-human somatic cell hybrid panel containing defined
portions of human chromosome 16.

Bernier et al. (1994) assigned the placental estrogen sulfotransferase
to chromosome 16 using DNA from panels of human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids and PCR amplification. Weinshilboum (1995) pointed out that the
'placental estrogen sulfotransferase' gene that Bernier et al. (1994)
mapped to chromosome 16 is, in fact, the STM gene. Bernier et al. (1994)
reported, on the basis of expression data, that the mRNA encoded by
their gene can catalyze the sulfate conjugation of estrogens, although
with a much lower affinity than the mRNA encoded by the human STE gene
that is localized on 4q13.1 (600043).

The STM gene, a thermolabile phenol sulfotransferase, maps very near the
location of the thermostable phenol sulfotransferase, STP1. Her et al.
(1996) showed that a second thermolabile phenol sulfotransferase, STP2
(601292), also maps to chromosome 16.

607292	TITLE *607292 SEMAPHORIN 4A; SEMA4A
;;SEMAPHORIN B; SEMAB; SEMB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SEMA4A is a member of the semaphorin family of soluble and transmembrane
proteins. Semaphorins are involved in guidance of axonal migration
during neuronal development and in immune responses.

CLONING

Using degenerate PCR primers based on motifs conserved in members of the
semaphorin family, Kumanogoh et al. (2002) identified mouse Sema4a,
which was originally identified as SemB (Puschel et al., 1995). RT-PCR
analysis detected prominent expression in adult mouse brain, spleen,
lung, kidney, and testis. Flow cytometric analysis showed expression in
B cells and dendritic cells (DCs) but not in resting T cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Kumanogoh et al. (2002) showed that activation upregulated expression of
mouse Sema4a in both B and T cells, and proliferation and interleukin-2
(IL2; 147680) production by T cells were enhanced in the presence of
Sema4a. However, Sema4a, unlike CD100 (SEMA4D; 601866), did not enhance
the activation of B cells or DCs. Mice treated with Sema4a had enhanced
priming of antigen-specific T cells secreting both IL4 (147780) and
gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570). Treatment of mice with anti-Sema4a
early after immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
suppressed the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
In these mice, infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells was
ablated by inhibition of the generation of antigen-specific T cells by
anti-Sema4a. Expression cloning determined that the high-affinity
receptor for Sema4a is Tim2. Sema4a stimulation of cells expressing Tim2
induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Tim2 but not of Tim3 (606652).
Kumanogoh et al. (2002) concluded that Sema4a and CD100 have crucial
roles in the reciprocal stimulation between T cell and
antigen-presenting cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Abid et al. (2006) screened 135 Pakistani patients with retinitis
pigmentosa (RP35; 610282), 25 with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD10; 610283),
and 30 with congenital blindness for mutations in the SEMA4A gene. They
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 substitutions
(607292.0001-607292.0002) in 2 RP and 2 CORD patients and heterozygosity
for another substitution (607292.0003) in 3 patients with RP and 1
patient with congenital blindness. No mutations in SEMA4A were found in
affected members of a Pakistani family with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD8;
605549) previously mapped to chromosome 1q12-q24 (Ismail et al., 2006).

In 2 Pakistani patients with retinitis pigmentosa-35 (610282) and 2 with
cone-rod dystrophy-10 (610282), Abid et al. (2006) identified compound
heterozygosity for a G-to-C transversion in codon 345 and a T-to-G
transversion in codon 350 in exon 10 of the SEMA4A gene, resulting in an
asp345-to-his (D345H) and a phe350-to-cys (F350C; 607292.0002)
substitution in the conserved semaphorin domain, respectively. Sequence
analysis of the unaffected parents of 1 of the CORD patients revealed
that his father was heterozygous for the D345H mutation and his mother
was heterozygous for the F350C mutation. Neither mutation was found in
100 ethnically matched controls.

identified heterozygosity for a G-to-A transition in codon 713 of exon
15 of the SEMA4A gene, resulting in an arg713-to-gln (R713Q)
substitution in the cytoplasmic tail. Sequence analysis of family
members of 1 of the RP patients confirmed that the R713Q mutation
segregated with the disease phenotype in an autosomal dominant mode of
inheritance, and the mutation was not found in 100 ethnically matched
controls.

606238	TITLE *606238 IKAROS FAMILY ZINC FINGER 5; IKZF5
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN, SUBFAMILY 1A, MEMBER 5; ZNFN1A5;;
PEGASUS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the Ikaros (ZNFN1A1; 603023) family of transcription factors,
which includes Pegasus, are expressed in lymphocytes and are implicated
in the control of lymphoid development.

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen on an erythroleukemia cDNA library with
the C-terminal dimerization domain of Aiolos (606221) as bait, followed
by RT-PCR, Perdomo et al. (2000) isolated cDNAs encoding Eos (606239)
and Pegasus. Sequence analysis predicted that the Pegasus protein
contains 419 amino acids. Like the other Ikaros family members, Pegasus
has a conserved C-terminal zinc finger cluster. However, Pegasus has
little homology in its other regions to Ikaros family proteins, and it
has 3 divergent N-terminal zinc fingers rather than the 4 N-terminal
fingers conserved in the other members. GST pull-down experiments showed
that the C-terminal zinc fingers of Pegasus interact with other Ikaros
proteins and with Pegasus itself, establishing the presence of
functional dimerization domains. DNA binding analysis indicated that
Eos, but not Pegasus, interacts with high affinity with sequences
similar to those bound by Ikaros and other family members. Pegasus was
found to preferentially recognize GnnTGTnG rather than the tGGGAatacc
site recognized by other Ikaros family members. Reporter analysis
demonstrated that Pegasus acts as a transcriptional repressor at its
sites but not at Eos sites. Northern blot analysis revealed broad
expression of 3 Pegasus transcripts in hemopoietic cell lines and in
tissues, a pattern that contrasts with the immune tissue-restricted
expression of other Ikaros family members.
