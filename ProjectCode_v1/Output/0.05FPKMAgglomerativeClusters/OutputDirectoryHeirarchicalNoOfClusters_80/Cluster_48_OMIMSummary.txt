DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sialophorin (leukosialin) is a major sialoglycoprotein on the surface of
human T lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and some B lymphocytes,
which appears to be important for immune function and may be part of a
physiologic ligand-receptor complex involved in T-cell activation.

CLONING

Pallant et al. (1989) stated that sialophorin had been identified by the
L10 monoclonal antibody. Pallant et al. (1989) isolated a cDNA clone
encoding leukosialin from a library constructed from human peripheral
blood cells. Southern blot analysis suggested that the gene is present
in single copy.

Shelley et al. (1988, 1989) isolated and sequenced cDNA clones for
sialophorin. The longest sequenced clone was 1.7 kb and encoded 5 of 7
isolated tryptic peptides. Northern blot analysis indicated that the
sialophorin transcript is 2.5 kb long. The nucleotide sequence of the
1.7-kb clone showed that the sialophorin transcript has a
3-prime-noncoding region of 587 nucleotides, is polyadenylated, and has
the AATAAA polyadenylation signal. The derived sequence of 341 amino
acids showed that the sialophorin protein has 3 domains: an
extracellular domain of 195 amino acids, a hydrophobic transmembrane
domain of 23 amino acids, and a C-terminal intracellular domain of 123
amino acids which contains a number of sites that might be
phosphorylated by protein kinase C.

GENE FUNCTION

By introducing a cDNA encoding the human CD43 protein into an
antigen-responsive murine T-cell hybridoma, Park et al. (1991) found
that the antigen-specific activation of T cells was enhanced. The
intracellular domain of CD43, which is hyperphosphorylated during T-cell
activation, was required for this function.

Schmid et al. (1992) presented evidence that the galactoglycoprotein of
plasma represents the extracellular portion of CD43 derived by
proteolytic cleavage from the transmembrane portion. Bazil and
Strominger (1993) showed that CD43 is proteolytically cleaved from the
surface of stimulated lymphocytes and granulocytes. They suggested that
induced enzymatic cleavage of leukocyte receptors may represent a
general mechanism regulating surface expression of these molecules.

Using immunoprecipitation and cell-binding analyses, van den Berg et al.
(2001) showed that both the 240-kD SELPLG (600738) and the 130-kD CD43
proteins bind to macrophage-restricted SIGLEC1 (SN; 600751) in solution.
However, only T cell-bound CD43, and not SELPLG, in either the branched
or unbranched glycoform binds when expressed on the cell surface. Thus,
CD43 is the T-cell counterreceptor for SN.

The immunologic synapse is the T cell-APC (antigen-presenting cell)
contact site where T-cell receptors (TCRs), coreceptors, signaling
molecules, and adhesion receptors polarize upon antigen recognition. The
formation of the immunologic synapse is thought to be important for
receptor signal transduction and full T-lymphocyte activation. CD43 is a
large sialoprotein diffusely expressed in unactivated T cells. Using
antigen-activated T cells and confocal microscopy, Delon et al. (2001)
demonstrated that moesin (309845) is excluded from the region of T
cell-APC contact and colocalizes with CD43. Western blot and
immunocytochemical analyses showed that moesin is rapidly
dephosphorylated upon antigen recognition and then rephosphorylated on
threonine residues. Only phosphorylated moesin was able to bind CD43.
Delon et al. (2001) concluded that T-cell activation requires the
removal of CD43 from the immunologic synapse to allow efficient
engagement of the TCR with molecules on the APC.

Using mouse helper T cell lines and confocal microscopy, Allenspach et
al. (2001) determined that the cytoplasmic tail of CD43 is necessary and
sufficient for CD43 removal from the immunologic synapse. In at least
some cells, CD43 is located at the distal pole of the T cell together
with ezrin (123900) and moesin. No differences in the behavior of ezrin
and moesin were noted throughout the study. Using cells from Cd43 -/-
mice, Allenspach et al. (2001) observed that ezrin-radixin
(179410)-moesin (ERM) family proteins move independently of the large
CD43 mucin. Overexpression of a dominant-negative ERM mutant containing
the N-terminal 320 amino acids of ezrin inhibited the activation-induced
movement of CD43 without affecting conjugate formation. The
dominant-negative mutant reduced cytokine production but not the
expression of T-cell activation markers.

GENE STRUCTURE

Shelley et al. (1990) reported that the CD43 gene has a single intron of
378 bp that interrupts the sequence specifying the 5-prime untranslated
region of the mRNA. The gene is, therefore, unusual in that the discrete
extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular regions of the protein,
including repeat sequences in the extracellular region, are not encoded
by separate exons.

MAPPING

Shelley et al. (1989) determined that the human sialophorin gene appears
to be unique within the haploid genome, and they assigned it to
chromosome 16 by Southern blot analysis of DNA from rodent-human cell
hybrids. By study of somatic cell hybrids, Pallant et al. (1989)
demonstrated that the leukosialin gene is not X-linked; by in situ
hybridization, they mapped the gene to 16p11.2. Baecher et al. (1990)
demonstrated that the mouse leukosialin gene, designated Ly48, is
encoded by chromosome 7.

PATHOGENESIS

Sialophorin is defective in lymphocytes of patients with Wiskott-Aldrich
syndrome (301000). Since the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is X-linked, its
primary cause must reside in a defect of a gene other than the
structural gene for sialophorin. (The existence of an autosomal form of
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome has been suggested (277970).) Specific
interaction of CD43 with a ligand on the surface of T cells appears to
contribute to T-cell activation. Rosenstein et al. (1991) presented
evidence that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1, or CD54; 147840)
is a ligand for CD43. Rosenstein et al. (1991) suggested that the defect
in T-cell function in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome may result from defective
CD43/ICAM1 interaction. Many patients with HIV infection have
circulating anti-CD43 antibodies; these autoantibodies may contribute to
the severe immunodeficiency found in AIDS patients.

613907	TITLE *613907 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 652; ZNF652
;;KIAA0924
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned ZNF652, which they designated
KIAA0924. The deduced protein contains 606 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected moderate ZNF652 expression in all tissues and specific brain
regions examined except spleen, where expression was low.

Using a sequence from CBFA2T3 (603870) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a human breast cDNA library, Kumar et al. (2006) cloned
ZNF652. The deduced 606-amino acid protein contains 7 central C2H2-type
zinc finger motifs. RNA dot-blot analysis revealed ubiquitous ZNF652
expression, with highest levels in breast, vulva, prostate, and
pancreas. ZNF652 expression was reduced in a number of cancers compared
with matched normal tissue. Western blot analysis detected ZNF652 at an
apparent molecular mass of 85 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis of cotransfected HEK293T cells, Kumar et
al. (2006) confirmed that ZNF652 interacted with CBFA2T3. Deletion
analysis revealed that the C-terminal 109-amino acids of ZNF652 were
required for the interaction, and inclusion of the ZNF652 central zinc
finger domain stabilized the interaction. Reporter gene assays showed
that ZNF652 functioned as a transcriptional repressor. CBFA2T3 enhanced
the repressor activity of ZNF652 in a dose-dependent manner.

Kumar et al. (2008) found that ZNF652 alone or in complex with CBFA2T3
bound the consensus ZNF652 response element (AAGGGTTAA) found in the
promoter region of the HEB (TCF12; 600480) gene. In HEK293T cells, which
express endogenous ZNF652 and CBFA2T3, overexpression of either
repressor downregulated HEB expression, and repression was enhanced by
coexpression of both ZNF652 and CBFA2T3. Mutation analysis revealed that
the NHR3 and NHR4 motifs of CBFA2T3 interacted with the proline-rich
stretch in the C terminus of ZNF652.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the ZNF652
gene to chromosome 17. Kumar et al. (2006) mapped the ZNF652 gene to
chromosome 17q21.32 by database analysis.

603420	TITLE *603420 CALUMENIN; CALU
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Many calcium-binding proteins are reported to be localized in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and involved in such ER functions as protein
folding and sorting. Among these are RCN1 (602735), RCN2 (602584), and
calumenin (CALU), which form a novel family of calcium-binding proteins
in the ER and Golgi apparatus. By searching sequence databases with a
mouse Calu cDNA sequence (Yabe et al., 1997), Yabe et al. (1998)
identified a human CALU EST, which they used to clone a full-length CALU
cDNA. The cDNA encodes a deduced 315-amino acid protein containing 6
EF-hand motifs, 1 potential N-glycosylation site, and a C-terminal ER
retention signal. The human and mouse CALU proteins are 98% identical.
Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the 3.4-kb CALU mRNA is
ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. Southern blot analysis using a
human CALU cDNA probe detected bands in a variety of species.

MAPPING

Yabe et al. (1997) mapped the mouse Calu gene to the proximal portion of
chromosome 7. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Yabe et al. (1998)
localized the human CALU gene to 7q32, which was an unexpected result
due to the homology of synteny between proximal mouse chromosome 7 and
human 19q13.2-q13.3.

612603	TITLE *612603 LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE PROTEIN 1A; LCE1A
;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 1; LEP1
LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE GENE CLUSTER, INCLUDED;;
LCE GENE CLUSTER, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LCE1A belongs to the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene cluster within
the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) on chromosome 1. The LCE
cluster contains multiple conserved genes that encode stratum corneum
proteins, and these genes are expressed relatively late during fetal
assembly of the skin cornified envelope (Jackson et al., 2005). For
further information on the LCE gene cluster, see GENE FAMILY below.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified human
LCE1A, which they called LEP1. RT-PCR analysis detected LEP1 in human
skin, but not in heart or esophagus. In situ hybridization of mouse
embryos showed that group 1 LEP genes, such as Lep1, were expressed just
before barrier formation in the epidermal barrier formation pattern.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) found that LCE1A, like other
LCE1 genes, was predominantly expressed in human fetal, arm, penal, and
abdominal skin. Little to no LCE1A expression was detected in vulva,
tongue, and esophagus.

GENE FUNCTION

Jackson et al. (2005) showed that expression of LCE1 genes, including
LCE1A, was upregulated in cultured normal human keratinocytes by
ultraviolet irradiation, but not by calcium.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that the LCE1A gene, like most LCE
genes, contains 2 exons. Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE1A
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) stated that the mouse Lce1a gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene
cluster on chromosome 3F1.

GENE FAMILY

- LCE Gene Cluster

Jackson et al. (2005) stated that the LCE gene cluster spans over 320 kb
within the EDC on chromosome 1q21 and can be divided into 3 gene groups,
designated LCE1, LCE2, and LCE3, based on chromosomal position and
protein homology. The LCE1, LCE2, and LCE3 subclusters are interspersed
with 2 individual LCE genes, LCE4A (612618) and LCE5A (612619), 4 LCE
pseudogenes, and several non-LCE genes. The LCE genes appear to have
arisen by gene amplification. Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005)
found that the LCE1 and LCE2 genes were expressed in skin, whereas the
LCE3 genes showed low-level, tissue-specific expression in all
barrier-forming epithelia tested, including internal epithelia. The LCE
genes responded in a group-specific manner to calcium and ultraviolet
light, with calcium causing upregulation of LCE2 genes, and ultraviolet
light causing upregulation of LCE1 and LCE2 genes.

De Guzman Strong et al. (2010) used a computational approach to identify
conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in the EDC queried for regulatory
function. Coordinate expression of EDC genes during mouse embryonic skin
development and a striking degree of synteny and linearity in the EDC
locus across a wide range of mammalian (placental and marsupial) genomes
suggested an evolutionary conserved regulatory milieu in the EDC. CNEs
identified by comparative genomics exhibited dynamic regulatory activity
(enhancer or repressor) in differentiating or proliferating conditions.
Epidermal-specific, developmental in vivo enhancer activities (DNaseI
and transgenic mouse assays) were demonstrated in CNEs, including one
within the psoriasis-associated LCE3C (612615)_LCE3B (612614) deletion
(see 603935).

120650	TITLE *120650 COMPLEMENT COMPONENT RECEPTOR 2; CR2
;;COMPLEMENT COMPONENT 3d RECEPTOR; C3DR;;
EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS RECEPTOR;;
EBV RECEPTOR;;
CD21
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Complement component receptor-2 (CR2, CD21) is the membrane protein on B
lymphocytes to which the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) binds during infection
of these cells. See also CR1 (120620). Yefenof et al. (1976) found
complete overlapping of EBV receptors and C3 (120700) receptors on human
B lymphocytes.

CD21, together with CD19 (107265), CD81 (186845), and CD225 (IFITM1;
604456), forms the B-cell coreceptor complex, which lowers the
activation threshold of the B-cell antigen receptor (summary by Thiel et
al., 2012).

CLONING

Rodriguez de Cordoba and Rubinstein (1986) demonstrated that
quantitative variations of the C3b/C4b receptor (CR1) in human
erythrocytes are controlled by genes within the regulator of complement
activation (RCA) gene cluster. Rodriguez de Cordoba and Rubinstein
(1986) symbolized this gene as C3bRQ. Moore et al. (1987) presented the
nucleotide and derived amino acid sequence of the CR2 gene. They pointed
out the close similarity to CR1 and to factor H, which are closely
linked loci in 1q32.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Szakonyi et al. (2001) described the x-ray structure of CR2 in complex
with its ligand C3d at 2.0 angstroms. The structure revealed extensive
main chain interactions between C3d and only 1 short consensus repeat
(SCR) of CR2 and substantial SCR side-to-side packing.

The 2 N-terminal SCRs (SCR1-SCR2) of CD21 interact with the EBV
glycoprotein gp350/220 and also with the natural CD21 ligand, C3d. Prota
et al. (2002) described the crystal structure of the CD21 SCR1-SCR2
fragment in the absence of ligand and demonstrated that it is able to
bind EBV. Based on a functional analysis of wildtype and mutant CD21 and
molecular modeling, they identified a likely region for EBV attachment
and demonstrated that this region is not involved in the interaction
with C3d. A comparison with the structure of CD21 SCR1-SCR2 in complex
with C3d showed that, in both cases, CD21 assumes compact V-shaped
conformations. However, the analysis revealed a surprising degree of
flexibility at the SCR1-SCR2 interface, suggesting that the interactions
between the 2 domains are not specific.

GENE FUNCTION

Using surface plasmon resonance analysis and ELISA, Asokan et al. (2006)
showed that IFNA (IFNA1; 147660) bound CR2 in the same affinity range as
the CR2 ligands EBV-gp350, C3d/iC3b, and CD23 (FCER2; 151445). IFNA
interacted with SCR1 and SCR2 within the same region of CR2 that serves
as the binding site for the other CR2 ligands. Treatment of B cells with
anti-CR2 diminished induction of IFNA-responsive genes. Asokan et al.
(2006) proposed that the roles of CR2 and IFNA in development of
autoimmunity may be mechanistically linked to pathogenesis of systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700).

MAPPING

Weis et al. (1987) demonstrated by Southern analysis of DNA from somatic
cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization using partial cDNA clones that
the CR2 gene is located on band 1q32.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Susceptibility to Systemic Lupus Erythematosis

Wu et al. (2007) found evidence of linkage at chromosome 1q32.2 in a
targeted genome scan of 1q21-q43 in 126 SLE multiplex families (see
SLEB9, 610927) containing 151 affected sib pairs (nonparametric linkage
score, 2.52; p = 0.006). The authors then analyzed the CR2 gene in 1,416
individuals from 258 Caucasian and 142 Chinese SLE simplex families and
demonstrated that a common 3-SNP haplotype (120650.0001) was associated
with SLE susceptibility (p = 0.00001) with a 1.54-fold increased risk
for development of disease. Wu et al. (2007) concluded that the CR2 gene
is likely a susceptibility gene for SLE.

- Common Variable Immunodeficiency-7

In a patient with a mild form of combined variable immunodeficiency-7
(CVID7; 614699), Thiel et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygous
mutations in the CD21 gene (120650.0002 and 120650.0003). Both mutations
caused functionally null alleles, with lack of CD21 expression on the
patient's B cells. The patient had hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent
infections. However, antibodies against recall antigens, such as
measles, mumps, and varicella, were normal, and he had antibodies
against EBV, suggesting that CD21 is not absolutely required for EBV
entry. The B cells showed a mature antigen phenotype, but there was a
reduction in class-switched memory B cells. Together with the
demonstrated defects in CD19 (107265) and CD81 (186845), this CD21
deficiency was the third genetic defect affecting the B-cell coreceptor
complex in humans. All 3 defects share the features of severely
decreased memory B-cell numbers, hypogammaglobulinemia, and recurrent
infections.

ANIMAL MODEL

Fairweather et al. (2006) found that mice deficient in both Cr1 and Cr2
had increased acute myocarditis and pericardial fibrosis due to
coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), leading to early progression to dilated
cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Increased inflammation was not
associated with increased viral replication. Immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated increased numbers of macrophages, higher Il1b
(147720) levels, and immune complex deposition in the heart. The mouse
complement regulatory protein, Crry, was increased in cardiac
macrophages, while immature B cells were increased in mutant mice after
CVB3 infection. Fairweather et al. (2006) concluded that CR1/CR2
expression is not necessary for CVB3 clearance, but it is involved in
protection against immune-mediated damage to the heart.

Wu et al. (2007) analyzed the CR2 gene in 1,416 individuals from 258
Caucasian and 142 Chinese SLE simplex (610927) families and demonstrated
that the major allele 3-SNP haplotype (+21T-C, dbSNP rs3813946; a
synonymous G-A SNP, dbSNP rs1048971; and a G-A SNP resulting in an S639N
substitution, dbSNP rs17615) was associated with SLE susceptibility (p =
0.00001) with a 1.54-fold increased risk for development of disease.
Studies using luciferase constructs revealed that the +21T-C SNP located
in the 5-prime untranslated region alters transcriptional activity.

CR2, IVS6DS, G-C, +1

In a 28-year-old man with common variable immunodeficiency-7 (CVID7;
614699), Thiel et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the CR2 gene: a G-to-C transversion in the donor site of
exon 6 (1225+1G-C), resulting in the in-frame skipping of exon 6, and a
2297G-A transition in exon 13, resulting in a trp766-to-ter (W766X;
120650.0003) substitution, which was demonstrated to result in
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The splice site mutation resulted in a
shorter mRNA that putatively codes for a truncated CD21 protein
predicted to lack the extracellular short consensus repeats 5 and 6.
Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1 of the mutations, neither
of which were found in 100 controls. Transfection of the mutations in
293T cells showed absence of CD21 expression at the cell surface,
consistent with complete absence of CD21 on the patient's B cells. The
patient had recurrent infections, splenomegaly, and
hypogammaglobulinemia affecting mainly IgG. IgA values were slightly
reduced and IgM levels were low-normal. Antibodies against recall
antigens, such as measles, mumps, and varicella, were normal, and he had
antibodies against EBV, suggesting that CD21 is not absolutely required
for EBV entry. The B cells showed a mature antigen phenotype, but there
was a reduction in class-switched memory B cells. Patient B cells showed
reduced binding to a C3d (see 120700)-containing immune complex and to
EBV compared to control cells, and also showed no costimulatory activity
via the B-cell receptor complex. Patient cells showed normal
proliferative response and production of immunoglobulin upon stimulation
with anti-IgM and anti-CD40 (109535), and the patient mounted a normal
antibody response to protein vaccination, although his response to
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination was somewhat impaired.

604780	TITLE *604780 ABHYDROLASE DOMAIN-CONTAINING 5; ABHD5
;;COMPARATIVE GENE IDENTIFICATION 58; CGI58;;
NCIE2 GENE; NCIE2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ABHD5 functions as an acyltransferase for the synthesis of phosphatidic
acid, the major intermediate in membrane and storage lipid biosynthesis.
It also functions as a coactivator of adipocyte triglyceride lipase
(ATGL, or PNPLA2; 609059) (Ghosh et al., 2008).

CLONING

By examining the critical region for Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (CDS;
275630), a rare autosomal recessive form of NCIE (see 242300), on
chromosome 3p21, Lefevre et al. (2001) identified several candidate
genes, one of which, designated CGI58, was identified by Lai et al.
(2000) as having homology to a protein from C. elegans. Lefevre et al.
(2001) determined that CGI58 encodes a 349-amino acid protein of
approximately 39 kD that has strong homology with several members of a
large family defined by an alpha/beta hydrolase fold. CGI58 contains 3
sequence motifs that correspond to a catalytic triad found in the
esterase/lipase/thioesterase subfamily but differs in that its putative
catalytic triad contains an asparagine in place of the usual serine
residue. Database analysis showed wide expression of CGI58 in various
tissues, including skin, lymphocytes, liver, skeletal muscle, and brain.
Database analysis also revealed conservation of CGI58 from bacteria to
human.

Ghosh et al. (2008) noted that human CGI58 contains esterase,
hydrolase/acyltransferase, and lysophospholipase domains.

Using Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses of differentiated
mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Yamaguchi et al. (2004) detected Cgi58
predominantly at the surface of lipid droplets, where it colocalized
with perilipin (PLIN1; 170290) and Adrp (PLIN2; 103195). Some Cgi58 was
also detected in the cytosol of differentiated adipocytes, but it was
not detected prior to differentiation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lefevre et al. (2001) determined that the ABHD5 gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

Lefevre et al. (2001) identified the ABHD5 gene in the critical region
for Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome on chromosome 3p21.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid and protein pull-down assays, Yamaguchi et al. (2004)
found that rat Cgi58 bound directly to mouse perilipin and Adrp.

Ghosh et al. (2008) found that purified recombinant human CGI58 had
acyltransferase activity and converted lysophosphatidic acid to
phosphatidic acid using palmitoyl-CoA or oleoyl-CoA as acyl donors.
CGI58 did not use any other lysophospholipid as acyl acceptor; rather,
its activity was inhibited by all other lysophospholipids or
phospholipids examined, predominantly lysophosphatidylcholine.
Biochemical and Western blot analyses of mouse white adipose tissue
suggested that Cgi58 functions in the cytosol as well as on lipid
droplets. Expression of human CGI58 complemented the metabolic defect in
yeast lacking the acyltransferase Ict1. Overexpression of CGI58 in yeast
increased the amount of all major phospholipids examined and reduced the
amount of triacylglycerol. The CGI58 mutations gln130 to pro (Q130P;
604780.0004) and glu260 to lys (E260K; 604780.0007), which eliminate the
ability of CGI58 to activate ATGL, had no effect on CGI58
acyltransferase activity. Ghosh et al. (2008) concluded that CGI58 has
independent ATGL coactivation and acyltransferase activities.

Using a cell culture model and various biochemical approaches, Wang et
al. (2011) investigated the mechanisms by which PLIN1, PLIN2, and PLIN5
(613248) control lipolysis by ATGL and its colipase, CGI58. PLIN5
exerted a negative regulatory role in lipid droplet hydrolysis by
binding and inhibiting ATGL activity at the lipid droplet surface under
basal conditions. Even after protein kinase A (PKA; see 188830)
activation, release of fatty acid was only modestly increased. In
contrast, recruitment of CGI58, followed by interaction with ATGL,
increased lipolysis. Neither PLIN1 nor PLIN2 directly interacted with
ATGL. Wang et al. (2011) proposed that PLIN5 plays a critical role in
oxidative tissues (e.g., heart and skeletal muscle) to protect
mitochondria from a rapid increase of fatty acid during lipolysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 9 families from the Mediterranean basin segregating Chanarin-Dorfman
syndrome (275630), Lefevre et al. (2001) identified 8 different
haplotypes and homozygous mutations in the ABHD5 gene
(604780.0001-604780.0008).

ANIMAL MODEL

Radner et al. (2010) obtained Cgi58 -/- mice at the expected mendelian
frequency, but they died within 16 hours after birth. Cgi58 -/- newborns
were smaller and weighed less than wildtype littermates, and they showed
abnormally low plasma lipid and glucose levels, ectopic lipid
accumulation, granulocyte vacuolization, and hepatic steatosis. Cgi58
-/- epidermis exhibited characteristics of lamellar ichthyosis with
impaired barrier function. Isolated fibroblasts from Cgi58 -/- embryos
showed excessive lipid storage due to impaired activation of
Atgl-mediated triglyceride hydrolysis. Immunohistochemical analysis of
Cgi58 -/- epidermis revealed delayed keratinocyte differentiation and
corneocyte formation. Unlike wildtype epidermis, Cgi58 -/- epidermis
transplanted onto nude mice exhibited severe growth retardation and
lacked fur development, suggesting that the skin defect in Cgi58 -/-
mice is inherent to the skin and not due to systemic Cgi58 deficiency.
Acylceramides are obligatory precursors for the covalent binding of
omega-OH-ceramides to corneocyte proteins. Characterization of the
corneal lipid envelope revealed reduced abundance of covalently bound
omega-OH-ceramides, elevated levels of free omega-OH-ceramides, and
undetectable acylceramides in Cgi58 -/- skin compared with wildtype or
Atgl -/- samples. Radiolabeled oleic acid was not released from the
triglyceride pool and was not converted to phospholipids or
acylceramides. The function of Cgi58 in skin appeared to be independent
of Atgl. Radner et al. (2010) concluded that CGI58 has a crucial role in
epidermal triglyceride catabolism for acylceramide synthesis, in
addition to its role in triglyceride homeostasis and energy catabolism.

613939	TITLE *613939 SPERMATOGENESIS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 20; SPATA20
;;SPERM-SPECIFIC PROTEIN 411; SSP411
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Shi et al. (2004) cloned rat Spata20, which they called Ssp411, and they
identified human SSP411 by database analysis. The deduced 787-amino acid
human protein shares 87% identity with rat Ssp411. SSP411 contains an
N-terminal CxxC thioredoxin (TXN; 187700)-like motif (CHWC) that is
conserved in human, mouse, and rat. Rat Ssp411 also has putative sites
for N- and O-glycosylation and phosphorylation. The N-terminal region of
rat Ssp411 was predicted to assume a thioredoxin fold with a potential
active-site disulfide bond between the cysteines of the CHWC motif.
Northern blot and semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses of rat tissues
detected Ssp411 in testis only, where it was expressed in spermatids,
but not in spermatocytes or spermatogonia. In situ hybridization of
adult rat testis detected Ssp411 in round spermatids and early elongated
spermatids. Immunohistochemical analysis detected Ssp411 protein
predominantly in elongated spermatids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Shi et al. (2004) determined that the SPATA20 gene contains 16 exons and
spans 8.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Shi et al. (2004) mapped the SPATA20 gene
to chromosome 17. They mapped the mouse Spata20 gene to chromosome 11.

Hartz (2011) mapped the SPATA20 gene to chromosome 17q21.33 based on an
alignment of the SPATA20 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK025000) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

615295	TITLE *615295 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 34; USP34
;;KIAA0570
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitin (191339)-specific proteases, like USP34, remove ubiquitin
modifications from ubiquitinated proteins and thereby rescue these
proteins from proteasomal degradation (Lui et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) obtained a partial USP34 clone, which they
designated KIAA0570. RT-PCR detected variable USP34 expression in all
tissues examined.

Lui et al. (2011) stated that full-length USP34 contains 3,546 amino
acids and possesses a central ubiquitin hydrolase domain characteristic
of deubiquitinating enzymes.

GENE FUNCTION

AXIN1 (603816) functions within a 'destruction complex' to inhibit
signaling through the Wnt (see 164820)-beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806)
pathway, which modulates multiple cellular processes during embryonic
development and adult tissue homeostasis. Lui et al. (2011) found that
USP34 interacted directly with ubiquitinated AXIN1 in AXIN1-containing
complexes in human cell lines. USP34 conferred deubiquitinating activity
to AXIN1 complexes and promoted AXIN1 nuclear accumulation. Knockdown of
USP34 reduced AXIN1 content and beta-catenin signaling, and AXIN1 levels
could be rescued by inhibition of the proteasome. In vitro, the isolated
recombinant USP34 hydrolytic core region exhibited robust ubiquitin
isopeptidase activity that required the catalytic residue cys1903. Lui
et al. (2011) concluded that nuclear AXIN1 has a positive regulatory
role in Wnt-beta-catenin signaling that is controlled by USP34.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the USP34 gene
to chromosome 2.

Hartz (2013) mapped the USP34 gene to chromosome 2p15 based on an
alignment of the USP34 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB011142) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

specific brain regions examined. Highest expression was found in adult
brain, followed by adult kidney, ovary, lung, liver, heart, and fetal
brain and liver. Within specific adult brain regions, highest expression
was detected in amygdala and caudate nucleus.

Kubota et al. (2004) noted that the human LRRC8A gene contains 810 amino
acids and shares 99% amino acid sequence identity with the mouse
ortholog. They identified 4 N-terminal transmembrane domains and 16
C-terminal extracellular leucine-rich repeats (LRRs).

GENE FUNCTION

Using semiquantitative PCR, Kubota et al. (2004) observed that mRNA
expression of LRRC8A in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was
eventually decreased by long-term stimulation by phytohemagglutinin,
contrary to the expression of other LRRC8 family members.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the LRRC8
gene to chromosome 9 (TMAP SGC34869).

Kubota et al. (2004) mapped the LRRC8A gene to chromosome 9q34.11 by
genomic sequence analysis. They localized the orthologous mouse gene to
chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Sawada et al. (2003) studied a girl with a balanced translocation,
t(9;20)(q33.2;q12), who had congenital agammaglobulinemia (AGM5; 613506)
and minor facial anomalies; she lacked B cells in peripheral blood and
showed epicanthic folds, mild hypertelorism, high-arched palate, and
lowered ears. Sawada et al. (2003) isolated the LRRC8 gene at the
translocation site on chromosome 9. The LRRC8 gene has 4 transmembrane
helices with 1 isolated and 8 sequentially located leucine-rich repeats
(LRRs). It was expressed on T cells as well as on B-lineage cells. The
translocation truncated the LRRC8 gene, resulting in deletion of the
eighth, ninth, and half of the seventh LRR domains (608360.0001) located
close to the C terminus. Protein products derived from the truncated
gene were coexpressed on white blood cells with the intact LRRC8 protein
from the untranslocated allele. Transplantation experiments with murine
bone marrow cells that were forced to express the truncated LRRC8 showed
that expression of the truncated protein inhibited B cell development,
producing a dominant-negative effect. The results indicated that LRRC8
is required for B cell development.

Conley (2003) commented on the variety of genes in which mutations can
cause congenital agammaglobulinemia through failure of B-cell
development. The genes encode components of the pre-B cell receptor or
proteins that are activated by crosslinking of the pre-B cell receptor.
Defects in these genes result in a block in B-cell differentiation at
the pro-B to pre-B cell transition. The defect in the LRRC8 gene in the
patient described by Sawada et al. (2003) caused a block at exactly the
same point in B-cell differentiation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA 5 (1 family)
LRRC8A, 1-BP INS, 2681T, TRANSLOCATION 20

In a patient with agammaglobulinemia-5 (613506), Sawada et al. (2003)
identified a reciprocal translocation, t(9;20)(q33.2;q12), and
demonstrated truncation of the LRRC8A gene, which was located at the
chromosome 9 breakpoint. The truncation resulted in deletion of the
eighth, ninth, and half of the seventh LRR domains located close to the
C terminus. The truncated gene encoded 754 amino acides, including 719
derived from exon 1 of the LRCC8A gene. In white cells, protein products
derived from the truncated gene were coexpressed with the intact LRRC8A
protein from the untranslocated allele. Experiments in mouse bone marrow
cells indicated that the truncated protein inhibited B-cell development.
A dominant-negative mechanism for expression of the defect in the
heterozygote was proposed.

606944	TITLE *606944 ERBB2 INTERACTING PROTEIN; ERBB2IP
;;DENSIN-180-LIKE PROTEIN; ERBIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a mouse kidney cDNA library with the 9
C-terminal residues of Erbb2 (164870) as bait, Borg et al. (2000) cloned
Erbb2ip, which they called Erbin. They cloned human ERBB2IP by RT-PCR of
a human B-lymphocyte cell line. The deduced 1,371-amino acid protein
contains 16 canonical LRR (leucine-rich repeat) motifs at the N
terminus, followed by an LRR-like domain, proline-rich stretches that
may represent binding sites for SH3 and WW domains, and a C-terminal PDZ
domain. Northern blot analysis revealed a 7.2-kb transcript in most
human and mouse tissues. Western blot analysis indicated a 180-kD
doublet in all tissues tested.

Favre et al. (2001) cloned ERBB2IP in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human
keratinocyte cDNA library with the N terminus of bullous pemphigoid
antigen-1 (BPAG1; 113810) as bait. They observed several splice
variants. ERBB2IP was expressed as a doublet of about 6.9 to 7.4 kb in
human keratinocytes and in a keratinocyte cell line. Semiquantitative
RT-PCR indicated numerous transcripts expressed in most tissues. Western
blot analysis showed a 200-kD in differentiated cells but not in
undifferentiated keratinocytes.

Huang et al. (2001) cloned Erbb2ip from mouse muscle, brain, and heart
cDNA libraries in a yeast 2-hybrid screen using Erbb2 as bait. Erbb2ip
was expressed as a 180-kD protein in brain, skeletal muscle, primary
muscle cultures, and muscle cell lines. Erbb2ip expression was found at
a similar level in myoblasts and myotubes, suggesting that expression is
not differentially regulated in muscle. By immunolocalization studies,
they colocalized Erbb2ip with the acetylcholine receptor at the
neuromuscular junction. Both Erbb2 and Erbb2ip were also found in
synaptosomes from adult mouse brain and copurified with postsynaptic
densities.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation, mutation analysis, and GST pull-down
experiments, Borg et al. (2000) determined that ERBB2IP interacts with
nonactivated ERBB2 and that the interaction requires the PDZ domain of
ERBB2IP. They further showed by immunolocalization studies that the 2
proteins colocalize to the basolateral surface of polarized human colon
carcinoma cells and that mutation of the PDZ domain of ERBB2IP causes
mislocalization of ERBB2 in stably transfected canine kidney cells.

By mutation analysis and in vitro binding assays, Favre et al. (2001)
determined that ERBB2IP interacts specifically with BPAG1 and integrin
beta-4 (147557).

Huang et al. (2001) found that mouse Erbb2ip associates with Psd95
(602887). Mutation analysis indicated that the interaction is dependent
upon the PDZ domain of Psd95.

GENE STRUCTURE

Favre et al. (2001) determined that the ERBB2IP gene contains at least
26 exons. Sequence comparison of ERBB2IP variants indicated that the
variants are likely caused by alternate splicing between exons 21 and
26.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ERBB2IP
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP WI-31186). Favre et al. (2001) stated that
sequence analysis places the ERBB2IP gene on the long arm of chromosome
5 between D5S427 and D5S647.

176740	TITLE *176740 PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN; PCNA
;;DNA POLYMERASE DELTA AUXILIARY PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Travali et al. (1989) isolated a cDNA clone of the entire human PCNA
gene and flanking sequences.

PCNA was originally identified by immunofluorescence as a nuclear
protein whose appearance correlated with the proliferative state of the
cell. A cell cycle-dependent protein described by Bravo (1986) and
called cyclin was shown to be identical to PCNA. The PCNA protein has
been highly conserved during evolution; the deduced amino acid sequences
of rat and human differ by only 4 of 261 amino acids. The human
anti-PCNA autoantibodies react not only with the nuclei of proliferating
cells of all experimental animals so far examined but also with the
nuclei of plant cells. Suzuka et al. (1989) demonstrated the presence of
the PCNA/cyclin-related genes in higher plants.

GENE FUNCTION

PCNA is required for replication of SV40 DNA in vitro and has been
identified as the auxiliary protein (cofactor) for DNA polymerase delta
(174761). Unlike DNA polymerases alpha (312040), beta (174760), and
gamma (174763), DNA polymerase delta has exonuclease activity. Since the
exonuclease activity is in the 3-prime-to-5-prime direction, DNA
polymerase delta has a proofreading activity and is expected to play a
significant role in the maintenance of the fidelity of mammalian DNA
replication (Suzuka et al., 1989).

It had been speculated that genetic engineering could improve the
long-term function of vascular grafts that are prone to atherosclerosis
and occlusion. Mann et al. (1995) showed that an 'intraoperative gene
therapy approach' using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to block medial
smooth muscle cell proliferation can prevent the accelerated
atherosclerosis that is responsible for autologous vein graft failure.
Selective prevention of the expression of genes for 2 cell cycle
regulatory proteins, PCNA and cell division cycle kinase-2 (CDK2;
116953), was achieved in the smooth muscle cells of rabbit jugular veins
grafted into the carotid arteries. This alteration of gene expression
successfully redirected vein graft biology away from neointimal
hyperplasia and toward medial hypertrophy, yielding conduits that more
closely resembled normal arteries. Furthermore, the genetically
engineered grafts proved resistant to diet-induced atherosclerosis.

Hasan et al. (2001) demonstrated that p300 (602700) may have a role in
DNA repair synthesis through its interaction with PCNA. Hasan et al.
(2001) demonstrated that in vitro and in vivo p300 forms a complex with
PCNA that does not depend on the S phase of the cell cycle. A large
fraction of both p300 and PCNA colocalized to speckled structures in the
nucleus. Furthermore, the endogenous p300-PCNA complex stimulates DNA
synthesis in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicated
that p300 is associated with freshly synthesized DNA after ultraviolet
irradiation. Hasan et al. (2001) suggested the p300 may participate in
chromatin remodeling at DNA lesion sites to facilitate PCNA function in
DNA repair synthesis.

The RAD6 pathway (312180, 179095) is central to postreplicative DNA
repair in eukaryotic cells. Two principal elements of this pathway are
the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes RAD6 and the MMS2 (603001)-UBC13
(603679) heterodimer, which are recruited to chromatin by the RING
finger proteins RAD18 (605256) and RAD5 (608048), respectively. Hoege et
al. (2002) showed that UBC9 (601661), a SUMO (see 601912)-conjugating
enzyme, is also affiliated with this pathway and that PCNA, a DNA
polymerase sliding clamp involved in DNA synthesis and repair, is a
substrate. PCNA is monoubiquitinated through RAD6 and RAD18, modified by
lys63-linked multiubiquitination, which additionally requires MMS2,
UBC13, and RAD5, and is conjugated to SUMO by UBC9. All 3 modifications
affect the same lysine residue of PCNA, lys164, suggesting that they
label PCNA for alternative functions. Hoege et al. (2002) demonstrated
that these modifications differentially affect resistance to DNA damage,
and that damage-induced PCNA ubiquitination is elementary for DNA repair
and occurs at the same conserved residue in yeast and humans.

SUMO uses a ubiquitin conjugation system to counteract the effects of
ubiquitination. Ubiquitin and SUMO compete for modification of PCNA, an
essential processivity factor for DNA replication and repair. Whereas
multiubiquitination is mediated by components of the RAD6 pathway and
promotes error-free repair, SUMO modification is associated with
replication. Stelter and Ulrich (2003) demonstrated that RAD6-mediated
monoubiquitination of PCNA activates translesion DNA synthesis by the
damage-tolerant polymerases eta (603968) and zeta (602776) in yeast.
Moreover, polymerase zeta is differentially affected by monoubiquitin
and SUMO modification of PCNA. Whereas ubiquitination is required for
damage-induced mutagenesis, both SUMO and monoubiquitin contribute to
spontaneous mutagenesis in the absence of DNA damage. Stelter and Ulrich
(2003) concluded that their data assigned a function to SUMO during S
phase and demonstrated how ubiquitin and SUMO, by regulating the
accuracy of replication and repair, contribute to overall genomic
stability.

Poot et al. (2004) identified 4 potential PCNA-binding motifs in
Williams syndrome transcription factor (WSTF, or BAZ1B; 605681). By
immunoprecipitation and in vitro protein pull-down experiments with HeLa
cell nuclear extracts, they confirmed a direct interaction between PCNA
and WSTF that did not require DNA. The complex containing PCNA was
distinct from the WSTF-including nucleosome assembly complex (WINAC).
Poot et al. (2004) found that PCNA targeted WSTF to DNA replication
foci, and WSTF, in turn, recruited SNF2H (SMARCA5; 603375) to
replication sites. RNA interference-mediated depletion of WSTF or SNF2H
caused compaction of newly replicated chromatin and increased the amount
of heterochromatin markers.

In yeast, chromatid cohesion is essential for viability and is triggered
by the conserved protein Eco1. Moldovan et al. (2006) found that yeast
Eco1 and its human homolog, ESCO2 (609353), interacted directly with
PCNA via a conserved PIP box variant in their N termini. Yeast Eco1
mutants deficient in Eco1-Pcna interaction were defective in chromatid
cohesion and inviable. Moldovan et al. (2006) concluded that PCNA is
crucially involved in the establishment of cohesion in S phase.

Maga et al. (2007) analyzed the effects of human PCNA and replication
protein A (RPA; 179835) on 6 different human DNA polymerases belonging
to the B, Y, and X classes during in vitro bypass of different lesions.
The mutagenic lesion 8-oxo-guanine has high miscoding potential. A major
and specific effect was found for 8-oxo-G bypass with DNA pol-lambda
(606343) and -eta (603968). PCNA and RPA allowed correct incorporation
of dCTP opposite an 8-oxo-G template 1,200-fold more efficiently than
the incorrect dATP by DNA pol-lambda, and 68-fold by DNA pol-eta,
respectively. Experiments with DNA pol-gamma (174763)-null cell extracts
suggested an important role for DNA pol-lambda. On the other hand, DNA
pol-iota (605252) together with DNA pol-alpha (312040), -delta (174761),
and -beta (174760), showed a much lower correct bypass efficiency. Maga
et al. (2007) concluded that their findings showed the existence of an
accurate mechanism to reduce the deleterious consequences of oxidative
damage and, in addition, pointed to an important role for PCNA and RPA
in determining a functional hierarchy among different DNA pols in lesion
bypass.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Bowman et al. (2004) reported the crystal structure of the 5-protein
clamp loader complex (replication factor-C, RFC; see 102579) of the
yeast S. cerevisiae, bound to the sliding clamp (PCNA). Tight
interfacial coordination of the ATP analog ATP-gamma-S by RFC resulted
in a spiral arrangement of the ATPase domains of the clamp loader above
the PCNA ring. Placement of a model for primed DNA within the central
hole of PCNA revealed a striking correspondence between the RFC spiral
and the grooves of the DNA double helix. Bowman et al. (2004) concluded
that this model, in which the clamp loader complex locks into primed DNA
in a screwcap-like arrangement, provides a simple explanation for the
process by which the engagement of primer-template junctions by the
RFC:PCNA complex results in ATP hydrolysis and release of the sliding
clamp on DNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Travali et al. (1989) showed that the human PCNA gene is present in
single copy and has 6 exons. It spans 4,961 bp, from the cap site to the
poly(A) signal. An unusual feature was the presence of extensive
sequence similarities among introns and between introns and exons.

MAPPING

Ku et al. (1989) mapped the PCNA gene to chromosome 20 by Southern
analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNA. Two pseudogenes were identified,
one mapping to Xpter-q13 and a second mapping to 6pter-p12. By in situ
hybridization, Webb et al. (1990) assigned the locus to 20p13. They also
found 2 strong secondary peaks of grains over 11p15.1 and Xp11.4. From
studies by in situ hybridization, Rao et al. (1991) concluded that the
PCNA gene is located at or close to 20p12.

- PSEUDOGENES

Taniguchi et al. (1996) characterized 2 'new' PCNA pseudogenes that are
tandemly localized on 4q24. One is a pseudogene and the other is a
truncated pseudogene.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Peshavaria and Day (1991) determined that the ENO3 gene encodes a
deduced 433-amino acid protein.

MAPPING

Chen and Giblett (1976) and Pearce et al. (1976) presented evidence for
3 enolase loci. By in situ hybridization studies using a probe for ENO2
(131360), Craig et al. (1989) found small aggregates of grains at
1pter-p36, the site of ENO1 (172430), and some at 17pter-p12.

Feo et al. (1990) mapped the muscle-specific beta-enolase (ENO3) to
chromosome 17pter-p11 by analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids
and transfectant cell lines carrying different portions of chromosome
17. This muscle-specific enzyme maps to the region encoding the gene
cluster for the sarcomeric myosin heavy chains (MYH1; 160730).

GENE STRUCTURE

Peshavaria and Day (1991) determined that the ENO3 gene contains 12
exons and spans approximately 6 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a man with glycogen storage disease XIII (GSD13; 612932), Comi et al.
(2001) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ENO3
gene (G156D, 131370.0001; G374E, 131370.0002). Immunohistochemistry and
immunoblotting detected dramatically reduced beta-enolase protein in
this patient, while alpha-enolase was normally represented.
