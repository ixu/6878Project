601832	TITLE *601832 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L29; RPL29
;;HP/HS-INTERACTING PROTEIN; HIP;;
HEPARIN/HEPARAN SULFATE-BINDING PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Liu et al. (1996) used RT-PCR to identify transcripts encoding cell
surface heparin/heparan sulfate- (HP/HS-) binding peptides. One clone
isolated in this manner had a predicted peptide sequence with features
of an HP/HS-binding motif; the authors termed this transcript HIP, for
'HP/HS interacting protein.' Liu et al. (1996) cloned the corresponding
cDNA from a HeLa cell cDNA library and found that it encodes a 159-amino
acid polypeptide 80% similar to the rodent ribosomal protein L29.
Transfection of HIP cDNA demonstrated cell surface expression, and the
sequence encodes neither a membrane-spanning region nor a glycosylation
site. Northern blot analysis revealed that HIP is expressed as a 1.3-kb
message in a variety of human cell lines and tissues.

Mammalian ribosome proteins are members of multigene families that are
composed predominantly of multiple processed pseudogenes and 1
functional-containing gene, although some, such as human ribosomal
protein L37a, are present as single-copy genes. During a large-scale
partial sequencing of human heart cDNA clones, Law et al. (1996) found a
novel clone that was very similar to the rat ribosomal protein L29 in
both DNA and amino acid sequences. The cDNA encodes a protein that shows
80.4% homology to protein L29 from the large ribosomal subunit of rat.
The putative protein has a large excess of basic residues over acidic
residues, with a unique lysine-rich tandem repeat structure that
suggested a binding function. Liu et al. (1996) showed that RPL29 had
the same nucleotide sequence as does cell surface heparin/heparan
sulfate-binding protein, also designated HB/HS interacting protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Rohde et al. (1996) demonstrated direct binding between heparin and HIP.
They showed that HIP is expressed on the surfaces of intact RL95 uterine
epithelial cells and that RL95 cell suspensions form aggregates when
incubated with antibodies directed against HIP. Using
immunofluorescence, Rohde et al. (1996) demonstrated that HIP is
expressed in both luminal and glandular epithelium of normal human
endometrium.

MAPPING

Garcia-Barcelo et al. (1997) used a PCR-based strategy to distinguish
the functional intron-containing gene RPL29 from multiple pseudogenes.
By somatic cell hybrid analysis, radiation hybrid mapping, and
fluorescence in situ hybridization, they localized RPL29 to the
telomeric region of 3q, where it was the most distal marker identified
to that time. The gene is close to RPL35A (180468), which maps to
3q29-qter.

Kirn-Safran et al. (2000) mapped the single-copy mouse Rpl29 gene to
distal chromosome 9. Promoter analysis indicated the presence of binding
motifs for ubiquitously expressed transcription factors and for nuclear
factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011), as well as the lack of a TATA box.

608125	TITLE *608125 XYLOSYLTRANSFERASE 2; XYLT2
;;XT2;;
UDP-D-XYLOSE:PROTEOGLYCAN CORE PROTEIN BETA-D-XYLOSYLTRANSFERASE 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

For background information on xylosyltransferases, see XYLT1 (608124).

CLONING

Using degenerate primers based on the sequences of XT1 tryptic peptides,
Gotting et al. (2000) cloned XT2 by PCR and RACE of a placenta cDNA
library. The deduced 865-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 97 kD. XT2 has a potential type II transmembrane region, a
proline-rich sequence, and 3 potential N-glycosylation sites. XT2 shares
about 55% amino acid identity with XT1, including stretches that share
more than 80% identity. Alignment of the XT1 and XT2 proteins with Xt1
and Xt2 from rat liver revealed highly conserved sequences in the
central and C-terminal regions of the proteins. RT-PCR detected XT2
expression in all tissues examined, with greatest abundance in kidney
and pancreas.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gotting et al. (2000) determined that the XYLT2 gene contains 11 exons
and spans 15 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Gotting et al. (2000) mapped the XYLT2
gene to chromosome 17q21.3-q22.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

On the basis of the altered proteoglycan metabolism in pseudoxanthoma
elasticum (PXE; 264800), which suggested that enzymes from this pathway
function as a genetic cofactor in the severity of the disorder, Schon et
al. (2006) proposed the XYLT genes XYLT1 (608124) and XYLT2 as candidate
genes for this cofactor role. They screened all exons of these 2 genes
in 65 German PXE patients using denaturing high performance liquid
chromatography and analyzed the influence of variations on clinical
characteristics. They identified 22 variations in the XYLT genes. The
missense mutation ala115 to ser in XYLT1 (608124.0001) was associated
with higher serum XT activity (p = 0.005). The amino acid substitution
thr801 to arg in the XYLT2 gene (608125.0001) occurred with
significantly higher frequency in patients under 30 years of age at
diagnosis; all PXE patients with this variation suffered from skin
lesions compared to only 75% of the wildtype patients. The other
variants in the XYLT2 gene were found to be more frequent in patients
with higher organ involvement.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM, MODIFIER OF SEVERITY OF
XYLT2, THR801ARG

Schon et al. (2006) found that the amino acid substitution thr801 to arg
(T801R) in XYLT2 occurred with significantly higher frequency in
pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE; 264800) patients under 30 years of age at
diagnosis (43% vs 26%; p = 0.04); all PXE patients with this variation
suffered from skin lesions compared to only 75% of the wildtype patients
(p = 0.002). This variant was also more frequent in patients with organ
involvement (p = 0.02). The amino acid substitution arose from a 2402C-G
transversion in XYLT2 exon 11.

602178	TITLE *602178 CHONDROADHERIN; CHAD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chondroadherin (CHAD) was initially described by Larsson et al. (1991)
as a 36-kD matrix protein isolated from bovine cartilage. It was shown
to mediate chondrocyte-matrix interactions. Analysis of cDNA generated
from a bovine chondrocyte mRNA demonstrated that chondroadherin belongs
to the family of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins. Of the LRR
proteins, chondroadherin is most closely related to the proteoglycans
decorin (125255), biglycan (301870), fibromodulin (600245), and lumican
(600616), and the matrix protein PRELP (601914). Each of these molecules
is present in the extracellular matrix of cartilage, each possesses 10
adjacent LRR regions flanked by disulfide-bonded domains, and each
possesses consensus motifs within the LRR regions for N-linked
glycosylation.

Grover et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA of the human CHAD gene using
PCR-based techniques. The gene encodes a protein of 359 amino acids, of
which the first 21 amino acids represent a putative signal peptide
sequence. It possesses 11 leucine-rich repeats flanked by cysteine-rich
regions. The cDNA has a 5-prime untranslated region of 149 bp, a coding
region of 1,080 bp including the stop codon, and a 3-prime untranslated
region of 561 bp terminating in a poly(A) tail. The cDNA hybridized with
a single messenger RNA of 1.9 kb, which is present in chondrocytes at
all ages.

GENE STRUCTURE

Grover et al. (1997) determined that the CHAD gene contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

Using a cosmid clone spanning the CHAD gene, Grover et al. (1997)
assigned the gene to 17q21.33 by PCR analysis of human/hamster somatic
cell hybrids and by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

600284	TITLE *600284 ELONGATION FACTOR RNA POLYMERASE II; ELL
;;ELEVEN NINETEEN LYSINE-RICH LEUKEMIA GENE
DESCRIPTION Thirman et al. (1994) cloned the gene that fuses to MLL (159555) in
patients with acute myeloid leukemia associated with the translocation
t(11;19)(q23;p13.1). This translocation is distinct from another type of
11;19 translocation with a 19p13.3 breakpoint that results in the fusion
of MLL to the ENL gene (159556). By PCR screening of a cDNA library
prepared from a patient's leukemia cells with this translocation,
Thirman et al. (1994) obtained a fusion transcript containing exon 7 of
MLL and sequence of an unknown gene. The sequence of this gene was
amplified and used as a probe to screen a fetal brain cDNA library. On
Northern blot analysis, this cDNA detected a 4.4-kb transcript that was
abundant in peripheral blood leukocytes, skeletal muscle, placenta, and
testis and expressed at lower levels in spleen, thymus, heart, brain,
lung, kidney, liver, and ovary. In addition, a 2.8-kb transcript was
present in peripheral blood, testis, and placenta. On zoo blots, this
gene was shown to be evolutionarily conserved in 10 mammalian species,
as well as in chicken, frog, and fish. They named the gene ELL (for
'eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia' gene). A highly basic,
lysine-rich motif of the predicted ELL protein was homologous to similar
regions of several proteins, including the DNA-binding domain of
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (173870).

ELL was shown by Shilatifard et al. (1996) to encode an elongation
factor that can increase the catalytic rate of RNA polymerase II
transcription by suppressing transient pausing by the polymerase at
multiple sites along the DNA. The authors noted that ELL is the second
elongation factor to be implicated in oncogenesis (elongin (see 600786),
which is a transcription factor regulated by the product of the von
Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene (608537), was the first), and
they stated that these findings provide further support for a close
connection between the regulation of transcription and cell growth.

In studies of the transforming properties of the MLL-ELL fusion gene,
Lavau et al. (2000) retrovirally transduced primary murine hematopoietic
progenitors and assessed their growth properties both in vitro and in
vivo. MLL-ELL increased the proliferation of myeloid colony-forming
cells in methylcellulose cultures upon serial replating, whereas
overexpression of ELL alone had no effect. Reconstitution of lethally
irradiated congenic mice with bone marrow progenitors transduced with
MLL-ELL resulted in the development of monoclonal or pauciclonal acute
myeloid leukemias within 100 to 200 days. The leukemic cells were
readily transplantable to secondary recipients and could be established
as immortalized cell lines in liquid cultures.

600187	TITLE *600187 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 5A; EIF5A
;;EIF5A1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The eukaryotic initiation factor 5A is an 18-kD protein composed of 154
amino acids. It contains a unique amino acid residue, hypusine, that is
formed posttranslationally via the transfer and hydroxylation of the
butylamino-group from the polyamine spermidine to a lys50 within the
EIF5A protein. Koettnitz et al. (1994) isolated and characterized the
human EIF5A pseudogene. Subsequently, Koettnitz et al. (1995) identified
a genomic clone encoding a functional EIF5A. The authors showed that
this sequence could successfully complement yeast carrying the HYP2
mutation (the homolog of EIF5A), whereas the pseudogenes could not.

GENE STRUCTURE

Koettnitz et al. (1995) found that the human EIF5A gene contains at
least 4 exons and spans at least 4.8 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Saini et al. (2009) used molecular genetic and biochemical studies to
show that EIF5A promotes translation elongation. Depletion or
inactivation of EIF5A in the yeast S. cerevisiae resulted in the
accumulation of polysomes and an increase in ribosomal transit times.
Addition of recombinant EIF5A from yeast, but not a derivative lacking
hypusine, enhanced the rate of tripeptide synthesis in vitro. Moreover,
inactivation of EIF5A mimicked the effects of the EEF2 (130610)
inhibitor sordarin, indicating that EIF5A might function together with
EEF2 to promote ribosomal translocation. Because EIF5A is a structural
homolog of the bacterial protein EF-P, Saini et al. (2009) proposed that
EIF5A/EF-P is a universally conserved translation elongation factor.

To identify tumor suppressor genes in lymphoma (605027), Scuoppo et al.
(2012) screened a short hairpin RNA library targeting genes deleted in
human lymphomas and functionally confirmed those in a mouse lymphoma
model. Of the 9 tumor suppressors identified, 8 corresponded to genes
occurring in 3 physically linked 'clusters,' suggesting that the common
occurrence of large chromosomal deletions in human tumors reflects
selective pressure to attenuate multiple genes. Among the newly
identified tumor suppressors were adenosylmethionine decarboxylase-1
(AMD1; 180980) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A),
2 genes associated with hypusine, a unique amino acid produced as a
product of polyamine metabolism through a highly conserved pathway.
Through a secondary screen surveying the impact of all polyamine enzymes
on tumorigenesis, Scuoppo et al. (2012) established the
polyamine-hypusine axis as a new tumor suppressor network regulating
apoptosis. Unexpectedly, heterozygous deletions encompassing AMD1 and
eIF5A often occur together in human lymphomas, and cosuppression of both
genes promotes lymphomagenesis in mice. Thus, Scuoppo et al. (2012)
concluded that some tumor suppressor functions can be disabled through a
2-step process targeting different genes acting in the same pathway.

Translation elongation factor P (EF-P) is critical for virulence in
bacteria. EF-P is present in all bacteria and orthologous to archaeal
and eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (a/eIF5A). Ude et al. (2013)
demonstrated that EF-P is an elongation factor that enhances translation
of polyproline-containing proteins: in the absence of EF-P, ribosomes
stall at polyproline stretches, whereas the presence of EF-P alleviates
the translational stalling. Moreover, Ude et al. (2013) demonstrated the
physiologic relevance of EF-P to fine-tune the expression of the
polyproline-containing pH receptor CadC to levels necessary for an
appropriate stress response. Bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic cells
have hundreds to thousands of polyproline-containing proteins of diverse
function, suggesting that EF-P and a/elF5A are critical for copy number
adjustment of multiple pathways across all kingdoms of life.

Doerfel et al. (2013) showed that EF-P prevents the ribosome from
stalling during synthesis of proteins containing consecutive prolines,
such as PPG, PPP, or longer proline strings, in natural and engineered
model proteins. EF-P promotes peptide-bond formation and stabilizes the
peptidyl-transfer RNA in the catalytic center of the ribosome. EF-P is
posttranslationally modified by a hydroxylated beta-lysine attached to a
lysine residue. The modification enhances the catalytic proficiency of
the factor mainly by increasing its affinity to the ribosome. Doerfel et
al. (2013) proposed that EF-P and its eukaryotic homolog, elF5A, are
essential for the synthesis of a subset of proteins containing proline
stretches in all cells.

MAPPING

Steinkasserer et al. (1995) mapped the EIF5A gene to 17p13-p12 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Three pseudogenes were mapped to
10q23.3, 17q25, and 19q13.2.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The 'pallid' mouse mutant represents a platelet storage pool deficiency
(SPD) manifesting with prolonged bleeding time, pigment dilution, and
other features. Huang et al. (1999) described the physical mapping,
positional cloning, and mutational and functional analysis of the gene
that is defective in pallid mice. The gene encodes a ubiquitously
expressed, highly charged 172-amino acid protein, which they called
pallidin, with no homology to known proteins. Huang et al. (1999)
isolated the orthologous gene encoding human pallidin and found that the
predicted protein has 86% amino acid identity with the mouse protein.
The first 60 amino acids give rise to an unstructured protein, followed
by 2 highly alpha-helical coiled-coil regions, essential for palladin
self-binding and binding to syntaxin-13 (see STX12, 606892).

Cullinane et al. (2011) noted that PLDN transcript-1, which they called
PLDN1, contains 172 amino acids and is encoded by exons 1 to 5.
Transcript-2, which they called PLDN2, contains 101 amino acids and is
encoded by exon A, exon 2, and exon B. PCR analysis of adult and fetal
human tissues showed ubiquitous expression of transcript-1 except for
absence in adult and fetal brain. Transcript-2 showed limited expression
in adult brain, testis, and leukocytes, and in fetal lung, brain, and
thymus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cullinane et al. (2011) determined that the PLDN gene contains 7 exons
with alternative splicing of exons A and B.

MAPPING

Huang (2000) stated that ESTs of the human PLDN gene had been mapped to
chromosome 15q15 by radiation hybrid mapping.

By ancestral chromosome mapping, Huang et al. (1999) localized the mouse
pallidin gene to chromosome 2E. The pallidin gene is closely linked to
mouse Epb42 (171070) and B2m (109700), 68 cM from the centromere.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Huang et al. (1999) discovered that
pallidin interacts with syntaxin-13 (see STX12, 606892), a t-SNARE
protein that mediates vesicle docking and fusion. Huang et al. (1999)
confirmed this interaction by coimmunoprecipitation assay.
Immunofluorescence studies corroborated that the cellular distribution
of pallidin overlaps that of syntaxin-13.

By coimmunoprecipitation and immunodepletion experiments of mouse skin
fibroblasts, Falcon-Perez et al. (2002) identified pallidin as a
component of BLOC1 (biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1;
see 601444), which also contains 'muted' (607289). A yeast 2-hybrid
screen found no direct interaction between muted and pallidin, but
pallidin was found to interact with itself. Residues that include 2
putative coiled-coil domains of human pallidin were necessary and
sufficient for self-assembly. Falcon-Perez et al. (2002) also determined
that pallidin/BLOC1 could interact with actin filaments in vitro and in
transfected cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Cullinane et al. (2011) analyzed the exonic regions of all 8 BLOC1
subunit-encoding genes in 38 patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome
(HPS)-like symptoms, who were negative for mutations in genes associated
with HPS1 through HPS6 (see 203300), and identified homozygosity for a
nonsense mutation in exon 3 of the PLDN gene in 1 patient (Q78X;
604310.0001). Noting that exon 3 is present only in the PLDN1
transcript, Cullinane et al. (2011) demonstrated that expression of the
PLDN2 transcript was not upregulated as a compensatory mechanism in the
patient's cells, suggesting that PLDN1 and PLDN2 have different
promoters and different functions within cells.

In a 17-year-old Italian girl with an HPS-like primary immunodeficiency
syndrome, Badolato et al. (2012) performed whole-exome sequencing and
identified homozygosity for the Q78X mutation in the PLDN gene; no
mutations were found in other immunodeficiency-associated genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

'Pallid' is 1 of 13 platelet SPD mouse mutants. Pallid (pa) animals
suffer from prolonged bleeding time, pigment dilution, kidney lysosomal
enzyme elevation, serum alpha-1-antitrypsin activity deficiency
(613490), and abnormal otolith formation. As with other mouse mutants of
this class, characterization of pallid mice suggested a defect in
organelle biosynthesis. Huang et al. (1999) detected a nonsense mutation
at codon 69 of this gene in the pallid mutant. Whereas the 'mocha'
(607246) and 'pearl' (603401) SPD mutants have defects in Ap3, the
findings of Huang et al. (1999) suggested that pallid SPD mutants are
defective in a more downstream event of vesicle trafficking, namely
vesicle docking and fusion. Huang et al. (1999) stated that pallid was
the fifth SPD mutant to be described at the molecular level. These
mutants are characterized by abnormalities in platelet-dense granules,
melanosomes, and lysosomes, and in each case, the predicted protein is
involved in organelle biogenesis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 9
BLOC1S6, GLN78TER

In a 9-month-old boy of Indian ancestry with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome-9
(HPS9; 614171), Cullinane et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a
232C-T transition in exon 3 of the PLDN gene, resulting in a
gln78-to-ter (Q78X) substitution, which would abolish a SC35 binding
site and is predicted to result in loss of exon 3 and a frameshift.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of PLDN transcript-1 showed normal mRNA
expression in patient fibroblasts and melanocytes; however, immunoblot
analysis showed that full-length palladin protein was absent from
patient cells. PCR analysis of patient fibroblast and melanocyte cDNA
did detect a faint lower band of PLDN, consistent with an alternative
transcript skipping exon 3. Cullinane et al. (2011) demonstrated that
even if the mutant transcript is translated into protein, although it
correctly localizes to early endosomes, it does not interact with
syntaxin-13 (see 606892). In patient melanocytes, the melanogenic
protein TYRP1 (115501) showed aberrant localization, an increase in
plasma-membrane trafficking, and a failure to reach melanosomes, thus
explaining the boy's severe albinism and establishing the diagnosis of
HPS9.

In a 17-year-old Italian girl with an HPS-like primary immunodeficiency
syndrome, Badolato et al. (2012) performed whole-exome sequencing and
identified homozygosity for the Q78X mutation in the PLDN gene. Sanger
sequencing confirmed the mutation, which was present in heterozygosity
in her unaffected parents but was not found in approximately 250 control
exomes or in the NHLBI exome collection. An increased proportion of both
resting and IL2 (147680)-activated NK cells from the patient expressed
CD107A (LAMP1; 153330) on the surface compared to controls, and patient
NK cells also showed moderately increased cell surface expression of
CD63 (155740). In addition, IL2-activated NK cells from the patient had
decreased granulation, and both resting and activated NK cells showed
reduced cytolytic activity compared to controls.

601555	TITLE *601555 RHO FAMILY GTPase 2; RND2
;;RAS HOMOLOG GENE FAMILY, MEMBER N; RHON;;
ARHN;;
GTP-BINDING PROTEIN RHO7; RHO7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the course of a complete genomic sequence analysis of 117 kb from
chromosome 17 containing the BRCA1 gene (113705) located on 17q21, Smith
et al. (1996) identified just centromeric to the BRCA1 gene a novel gene
they designated RHO7. RHO7 was identified initially as a homolog to the
RHO family (see 165370) of GTP-binding proteins (Chardin, 1991) by a
database search using deduced amino acid sequences from predicted exons.
The gene was found to be highly similar to the mouse EST homolog, with
more than 90% identity between the 2 nucleotide sequences.

By screening a human fetal brain cDNA library using bovine Rnd1 (609038)
as probe, Nobes et al. (1998) cloned RND2. The deduced protein contains
227 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 25.3 kD. It has 3
guanine-binding motifs, 2 loops and a threonine involved in phosphate
binding, and 3 major residues that coordinate magnesium in the GTP-bound
state. However, RND2 lacks the residues important for the intrinsic
GTPase activity of RAS (see 190020). RND2 ends with a CAAX box motif and
a terminal methionine residue, suggesting that RND2 is farnesylated.
Northern blot analysis detected high expression of a 1.5-kb RND2
transcript only in testis, with little to no expression in all other
adult and fetal tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Heng et al. (2008) demonstrated that the proneural protein neurogenin-2
(Neurog2; 606624), which controls neurogenesis in the embryonic cortex,
directly induces the expression of the small GTP-binding protein Rnd2 in
newly generated mouse cortical neurons before they initiate migration.
Rnd2 silencing leads to a defect in radial migration of cortical neurons
similar to that observed when the Neurog2 gene is deleted. Remarkably,
restoring Rnd2 expression in Neurog2-mutant neurons is sufficient to
rescue their ability to migrate. Heng et al. (2008) concluded that their
results identified Rnd2 as a novel essential regulator of neuronal
migration in the cerebral cortex and demonstrated that Rnd2 is a major
effector of Neurog2 function in the promotion of migration. Thus, a
proneural protein controls the complex cellular behavior of cell
migration through a remarkably direct pathway involving the
transcriptional activation of a small GTP-binding protein.

MAPPING

By FISH, Nobes et al. (1998) mapped the RND2 gene to chromosome 17q21.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gjerstorff and Ditzel (2008) stated that the GAGE12F gene is contained
within a 9.5-kb GAGE repeat. The GAGE12F gene contains 5 exons spanning
about 6.3 kb and has a LINE insertion.

606298	TITLE *606298 PROTOCADHERIN-GAMMA, SUBFAMILY A, MEMBER 11; PCDHGA11
;;PCDH-GAMMA-A11
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules, and
protocadherins constitute a subfamily of nonclassic cadherins. PCDHGA11
is 1 of 22 tandemly arranged genes within the PCDHG gene cluster
(604968) on chromosome 5q31. The 22 PCDHG genes function as 'variable'
exons that are individually spliced to a downstream constant region to
form distinct PCDHG transcripts. The variable PCDHG exons encode the
extracellular and transmembrane domains of the protocadherin protein,
and the common region encodes the intracellular domain (Wu et al.,
2001). For further information on the PCDHG genes, see 604968.

CLONING

By PCR of a brain cDNA library, Wu and Maniatis (1999) cloned
full-length PCDHGA11.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2001) mapped the PCDHGA11 gene
to chromosome 5q31, between the PCDHGB7 gene (606304) and a pseudogene
adjacent to the PCDHGA12 gene (603059). They localized the mouse PCDHG
genes to chromosome 18c.

605125	TITLE *605125 GABA-A RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; GABARAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Type-A receptors for the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)
(see 137160) are ligand-gated chloride channels that mediate inhibitory
neurotransmission. By performing a yeast 2-hybrid screen on a fetal
brain cDNA library using the intracellular loop of the GABA-A receptor
gamma-2S subunit (GABRG2; 137164) as bait, followed by screening an
adult brain cDNA library, Wang et al. (1999) identified a cDNA encoding
GABARAP. Sequence analysis predicted that the 117-amino acid, 13.9-kD
GABARAP protein contains a basic N terminus and an acidic C terminus,
with an overall pI of 9.6. Northern blot analysis detected a 0.9-kb
GABARAP transcript in all tissues tested, namely heart, brain, placenta,
lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas. Western blot
analysis also detected GABARAP expression in all tissues tested,
suggesting that GABARAP is also involved in biologic events other than
interaction with GABA-A receptors.

MAPPING

Komoike et al. (2010) noted that the GABARAP gene maps to chromosome
17p13.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Binding analysis by Wang et al. (1999) showed that the N-terminal 21
amino acids of GABARAP formed an alpha helix that interacted with
tubulin (see TUBA1; 191110). Immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemical
analysis in rat brain tissues demonstrated association and
colocalization of GABARAP and GABA-A receptors.

Apg8 is a ubiquitin-like protein involved in autophagy in yeast. A
cysteine protease, Apg4, cleaves Apg8 to create a C-terminal glycine
required for ubiquitin-like modification reactions. There are at least 4
mammalian Apg8 homologs: GATE16 (GABARAPL2; 607452), GABARAP, MAP1LC3
(see 601242), and APG8L (GABARAPL1; 607420). Hemelaar et al. (2003)
found that mouse Atg4b (611338) acted on the C termini of these 4 Atg8
homologs, and that the reaction required the active-site cysteine of
Atg4b. Although the amino acid sequences of these Apg8 homologs differ
from one another by as much as 71%, their affinities for Atg4b were
roughly comparable in competition experiments.

Using coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analyses, Lee et al.
(2005) identified DDX47 (615428) as a binding partner of GABARAP in
human 2774 and SKOV-3 ovarian tumor cell lysates. Yeast 2-hybrid
analysis confirmed the interaction. Overexpression of either DDX47 or
GABARAP alone had no effect on proliferation of SKOV-3 cells; however,
their coexpression inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis.

Behrends et al. (2010) reported a proteomic analysis of the autophagy
interaction network (AIN) in human cells under conditions of ongoing
(basal) autophagy, revealing a network of 751 interactions among 409
candidate interacting proteins with extensive connectivity among
subnetworks. Many new AIN components have roles in vesicle trafficking,
protein or lipid phosphorylation, and protein ubiquitination, and affect
autophagosome number or flux when depleted by RNA interference. The 6
human orthologs of yeast autophagy-8 (ATG8), MAP1LC3A, MAP1LC3B
(609604), MAP1LC3C (609605), GABARAP, GABARAPL1, and GABARAPL2, interact
with a cohort of 67 proteins, with extensive binding partner overlap
between family members, and frequent involvement of a conserved surface
on ATG8 proteins known to interact with LC3-interacting regions in
partner proteins. Behrends et al. (2010) concluded that their studies
provided a global view of the mammalian autophagy interaction landscape
and a resource for mechanistic analysis of this critical protein
homeostasis pathway.

ANIMAL MODEL

Komoike et al. (2010) found that Gabarap was expressed in the
telencephalon, hindbrain, and rhombomere of zebrafish during development
and later expressed in other brain regions. Knockdown of Gabarap
resulted in dwarfism of the entire zebrafish body, as well as a severely
hypoplastic head and mandible. The findings suggested that the Gabarap
gene plays a role in brain development in zebrafish.

609509	TITLE *609509 INTERLEUKIN 31; IL31
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IL31, which is made principally by activated Th2-type T cells, interacts
with a heterodimeric receptor consisting of IL31RA (609510) and OSMR
(601743) that is constitutively expressed on epithelial cells and
keratinocytes. IL31 may be involved in the promotion of allergic skin
disorders and in regulating other allergic diseases, such as asthma
(Dillon et al., 2004).

CLONING

Dillon et al. (2004) isolated IL31 from an activated T-cell cDNA library
based on its ability to stimulate proliferation of cells bearing IL31RA
and OSMR when translated. The predicted 164-amino acid IL31 precursor
protein produces a 141-amino acid mature protein that shares 31%
identity with the mature mouse protein. Quantitative real-time PCR
detected low expression of IL31 in testis, bone marrow, skeletal muscle,
kidney, colon, thymus, small intestine, and trachea. Among lymphoid and
myeloid cell subsets, IL31 was expressed in activated CD4
(186940)-positive T lymphocytes and at lower levels in CD8 (see
186910)-positive T cells, but not in natural killer cells, monocytes, or
resting B cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using flow cytometric analysis, Dillon et al. (2004) found that IL31
activated STAT1 (600555), STAT3 (102582), and STAT5 (601511), but not
STAT6 (601512).

Ip et al. (2007) found that stimulation of a bronchial epithelial cell
line with IL31 resulted in dose- and time-dependent upregulation of EGF
(131530), VEGF (192240), and CCL2 (158105). Combination of IL31 with
either IL4 (147780) or IL13 (147683) further enhanced CCL2 production.
IL31 also activated p38 MAPK (MAPK14; 600289), ERK (e.g., MAPK1;
176948), and JNK (MAPK8; 601158), and inhibition of these signal
transduction molecules differentially inhibited production of EGF, VEGF,
and CCL2. Ip et al. (2007) concluded that MAP kinase activation can be
crucial for IL31-mediated activation of bronchial epithelial cells and
suggested that IL31 may have a role in bronchial inflammation.

MAPPING

Dillon et al. (2004) stated that the IL31 gene maps to chromosome
12q24.31 and the mouse gene maps to a syntenic region on chromosome 5.

ANIMAL MODEL

Dillon et al. (2004) observed alopecia, severe pruritus, skin
thickening, and conjunctivitis, but no internal organ changes, in
transgenic mice overexpressing mouse Il31. Microscopic analysis of
lesional skin revealed several hallmarks of human atopic dermatitis.
However, the alopecia and pruritus developed in an IgE-independent
manner, suggestive of nonatopic dermatitis. Treatment of Rag1 (179615)
-/- mice with exogenous Il31 demonstrated that the alopecia, but not the
pruritus, was lymphocyte dependent. Dillon et al. (2004) proposed that
IL31 is involved in promoting dermatitis in allergic and nonallergic
diseases.

608504	TITLE *608504 RHO GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTOR 15; ARHGEF15
;;EPHEXIN 5; E5;;
KIAA0915
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Rho GTPase functions as a molecular switch by cycling between an active
GTP-bound form and an inactive GDP-bound form. Guanine nucleotide
exchange factors (GEFs) initiate the exchange of GDP with GTP and
promote the association of Rho with its effector molecules. ARHGEF15
functions as a specific GEF for RHOA (165390) (summary by Ogita et al.,
2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned ARHGEF15, which they designated
KIAA0915. The transcript contains a repetitive element in the 3-prime
untranslated region, and the deduced 777-amino acid protein shares 35.9%
identity over 499 amino acids with ARHGEF5 (600888). In descending
order, RT-PCR ELISA detected intermediate to low expression of ARHGEF15
in lung, ovary, heart, liver, kidney, testis, skeletal muscle, and
brain. Little to no expression was detected in pancreas and spleen.

By Western blot analysis, Ogita et al. (2003) determined that rat
Arhgef15 is expressed in the vascular smooth muscle cells of all organs
examined. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated weak staining in rat
cardiomyocytes, but none in other parenchymal cells or blood cells.
ARHGEF15 expression was also detected in human coronary artery smooth
muscle cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Ogita et al. (2003) found that endogenous rat Arhgef15 was
coimmunoprecipitated by anti-Epha4 (602188) antibody in a rat aortic
smooth muscle cell line, and mouse Epha4 immunoprecipitated with human
ARHGEF15 when coexpressed in a human embryonic kidney cell line.
Mutation analysis indicated that the Dbl homology domain and the
pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of ARHGEF15, but not the PH domain
alone, mediated the interaction with Epha4. The authors presented
evidence that ARHGEF15 has a role in RHOA activation and the regulation
of vascular smooth muscle contractility.

Margolis et al. (2010) showed that E5 functioned as a GEF for Rhoa, but
not Rac1 (602048) or Cdc42 (116952), and that it regulated synapse
formation in developing mouse neurons. E5 specifically
coimmunoprecipitated with ephrin receptor Ephb2 (600997). Knockdown and
overexpression studies revealed that binding of E5 to Ephb2 inhibited
formation of excitatory synapses. The E5-Ephb2 interaction was
terminated by the binding of ephrin B (see EFNB1; 300035) to Ephb2.
Activation of Ephb2 by ephrin B resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation,
release, and destabilization of E5, permitting the formation of
excitatory synapses. Degradation of E5 required its binding to the E3
ubiquitin ligase Ube3a (601623), and E5 degradation was inhibited by an
inactive Ube3a mutant or proteasome inhibition. Margolis et al. (2010)
observed that E5 localized to newly formed filopodia prior to synapse
development and appeared to restrict filopodia motility and growth.
Thus,they suggested that E5 might function as an initial barrier to
synapse formation until its degradation following ephrin B-mediated
activation of Ephb2. Margolis et al. (2010) noted that mutations in
UBE3A can cause Angelman syndrome (105830), and they showed that E5
expression was elevated in a mouse model of Angelman syndrome. They
concluded that elevated E5 expression during development may contribute
to abnormal cognitive function in Angelman syndrome.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the ARHGEF15
gene to chromosome 17. Gross (2011) mapped the ARHGEF15 gene to

607837	TITLE *607837 CLN8 GENE; CLN8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ranta et al. (1999) reported the positional cloning of a novel gene,
CLN8, in the critical region of chromosome 8p for progressive epilepsy
with mental retardation (EPMR; 610003), or Northern epilepsy. The CLN8
gene encodes a deduced 286-amino acid transmembrane protein with a
molecular mass of 80 kD. Ranta et al. (1999) also cloned mouse Cln8.

To determine the intracellular localization of CLN8, Lonka et al. (2000)
transiently transfected BHK cell lines with CLN8 cDNA. Using CLN8- and
cell organelle-specific antibodies with confocal immunofluorescence
microscopy, they showed that the CLN8 protein localizes primarily in the
ER, with partial localization in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment
(ERGIC). The ER-ERGIC localization was not altered in the CLN8 protein
containing a human CLN8 mutation (600143.0001). However, the truncated
murine mnd mutant protein was found only in the ER. Mutations in the ER
retrieval signal KKRP resulted in localization of CLN8 to the Golgi
apparatus. The authors concluded that CLN8 is an ER resident protein
that recycles between ER and ERGIC.

MAPPING

Ranta et al. (1999) identified the CLN8 gene within the critical region
of chromosome 8p for neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis-8 (CLN8; 600143).
Ranta (1999) stated that the Cln8 gene is located in the centromeric
region of mouse chromosome 8p, between markers D8Mit124 and D8Mit61.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ranta et al. (1999) found that 22 Finnish patients with the Northern
epilepsy variant of CLN8, were homozygous for an arg24-to-gly mutation
in the CLN8 gene (607837.0001). The findings indicated a founder effect.

In 9 of 18 families with the so-called Turkish variant of late infantile
CLN, Ranta et al. (2004) identified 4 mutations in the CLN8 gene (see
607837.0002-607837.0004), indicating that these patients in fact had
CLN8.

In 3 unrelated Italian patients with CLN8, Cannelli et al. (2006)
identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the CLN8
gene (see, e.g., 607837.0005 and 607837.0006, respectively).

ANIMAL MODEL

Ranta et al. (1999) found conservation of the codon harboring the human
CLN8 mutation with the localization of a mutation in the 'motor neuron
degeneration' (mnd) mouse, a naturally occurring mouse NCL (Bronson et
al., 1993). In mnd/mnd mice, they identified a homozygous 1-bp insertion
(267-268insC at codon 90) predicting a frameshift and a truncated
protein. This was the first description of the molecular basis of a
naturally occurring animal model for NCL.

Katz et al. (2005) identified a leu164-to-pro (L164P) mutation in the
Cln8 gene in English setter dogs with autosomal recessive NCL.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS, NEURONAL, 8, NORTHERN EPILEPSY VARIANT
CLN8, ARG24GLY

In 22 Finnish patients with the Northern epilepsy variant of CLN8
(610003), Ranta et al. (1999) found homozygosity for an arg24-to-gly
(R24G) missense mutation which resulted from a C-to-G transversion at
nucleotide 70. The carrier frequency was 1 in 135, consistent with a
founder mutation.

.0002
CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS, NEURONAL, 8
CLN8, TRP263CYS

In affected members of 3 families with the so-called Turkish variant of
late infantile CLN, originally reported by Topcu et al. (2004), Ranta et
al. (2004) identified homozygosity for a 789G-C transversion in exon 3
of the CLN8 gene, resulting in a trp263-to-cys (W263C) mutation. The
findings indicated that these patients in fact had CLN8 (600143). In
affected members of another Turkish family reported by Topcu et al.
(2004), Ranta et al. (2004) found compound heterozygosity for W263C and
R204C (607837.0003).

.0003
CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS, NEURONAL, 8
CLN8, ARG204CYS

In affected members of 5 families with the so-called Turkish variant of
late infantile CLN, originally reported by Mitchell et al. (2001) and
Topcu et al. (2004), Ranta et al. (2004) identified a homozygous 610C-T
transition in exon 3 of the CLN8 gene, resulting in an arg204-to-cys
(R204C) mutation. The findings indicated that these patients in fact had
CLN8 (600143). In affected members of another Turkish family reported by
Topcu et al. (2004), Ranta et al. (2004) found compound heterozygosity
for R204C and W263C (607837.0002).

.0004
CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS, NEURONAL, 8
CLN8, 1-BP DEL, 88G

In affected members of a family with the so-called Turkish variant of
late-infantile CLN, originally reported by Mitchell et al. (2001), Ranta
et al. (2004) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (88delG) in the CLN8
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination of the
protein.

.0005
CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS, NEURONAL, 8
CLN8, ALA30PRO

In an Italian child with CLN8 (600143), born of consanguineous parents,
Cannelli et al. (2006) identified a homozygous 88G-C transversion in
exon 2 of the CLN8 gene, resulting in an ala30-to-pro (A30P)
substitution.

.0006
CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS, NEURONAL, 8
CLN8, 1-BP DEL, 66G

In 2 unrelated Italian children with CLN8 (600143), Cannelli et al.
(2006) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the CLN8
gene: a shared 1-bp deletion (66delG) and a different pathogenic
missense mutation in each child. Haplotype analysis of the 66delG
mutation suggested a common ancestor.

.0007
CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS, NEURONAL, 8
CLN8, 3-BP DEL, 180GAA

In an Italian boy with CLN8 (600143), Vantaggiato et al. (2009)
identified a homozygous 3-bp deletion (180delGAA) in exon 2 of the CLN8
gene, resulting in the deletion of residue lys61. Further studies showed
that the patient had complete isodisomy of maternal chromosome 8. In
vitro studies in human neuroblastoma cells and mouse neuronal cells
showed that the mutation did not affect protein localization neuronal
differentiation, or cellular migration, but did result in increased
cellular proliferation that was specific to neuronal cells. Cells with
the 180delGAA mutation also showed an increased apoptotic response to
NMDA. The findings suggested an indirect role for CLN8 in cell survival.

609554	TITLE *609554 INTEGRAL MEMBRANE PROTEIN 2C; ITM2C
;;BRI3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The integral membrane protein family (ITMs, e.g., ITM2B, 603904)
consists of integral type II membrane glycoproteins with an
extracellular C terminus. Using sequence analysis and 5-prime and
3-prime RACE, Vidal et al. (2001) isolated a cDNA corresponding to
integral membrane protein 2C (ITM2C, which the authors referred to as
BRI3), and showed that it encodes a 267-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of 30.2 kD. ITM2C shares several conserved
features with other human and murine ITM family members, including 1
N-glycosylation and 2 phosphorylation sites and a single transmembrane
domain. Mouse Itm2c shares 92.9% amino acid identity with human ITM2C.
ITM2C shares 43.7% amino acid identity with ITM2B, with greatest
identity in the C-terminal portion. EST homology searches identified
clones encoding a 219-amino acid ITM2C splice variant. The promoter
region of ITM2C is GC-rich and contains 3 SP1 and 5 AP-1 binding sites.
Northern blot analysis showed strong expression of a 2.1-kb ITM2C
transcript in brain and very weak expression in several other tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human brain library with the
C-terminus of the beta-amyloid protein-converting enzyme BACE (604252)
as bait, Wickham et al. (2005) identified ITM2C as an interacting
protein. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the interaction of
ITM2C and BACE. By in situ hybridization, Wickham et al. (2005) showed
that ITM2C is widely expressed in mouse brain, especially in the
hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, olfactory lobe, and striatum. In situ
hybridization analysis showed that ITM2C and BACE were expressed in
overlapping patterns in the brains of an Alzheimer disease patient,
normal mouse, and a mouse model of Alzheimer disease. A series of
pulse-chase experiments showed that ITM2C is cleaved to an approximately
4-kD C-terminal secreted product, and that the convertases furin
(136950), PC7 (604872), and to a lesser extent PC5A (600488) are
responsible for this cleavage.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using genomic sequence alignment, Vidal et al. (2001) showed that the
ITM2C gene contains 6 exons and spans more than 20 kb.

MAPPING

Vidal et al. (2001) identified the ITM2C gene within a genomic clone
mapping to chromosome 2.

;;IMMUNITY-ASSOCIATED NUCLEOTIDE 4-LIKE 1; IAN4L1;;
IAN4-LIKE 1;;
IMMUNITY-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 3; IMAP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Daheron et al. (2001) cloned mouse Ian4 from a myeloid precursor cell
line. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.1-kb transcript in myeloid
cells. Cell fractionation and immunocytochemical analysis revealed
mitochondrial localization. A truncation mutant lacking the C-terminal
20 amino acids localized diffusely throughout the cytoplasm.

By searching a sequence database using IMAP1 (608084) as probe, Stamm et
al. (2002) identified IAN4L1, which they called IMAP3. The deduced
307-amino acid protein contains 5 motifs conserved in GTP-binding
proteins and a putative C-terminal transmembrane region. IAN4L1 shares
46% identity with IMAP1. Phylogenetic analysis showed that IAN4L1 is
homologous to mouse Ian4.

By Western blot and confocal microscopy analyses, Keita et al. (2007)
found that rat Gimap5 was expressed as a 35-kD protein in T lymphocytes,
but not other mononuclear cells, in a sedimentable subcellular
compartment distinct from mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Gimap5
did not colocalize with Bcl2 (151430).

GENE STRUCTURE

Stamm et al. (2002) determined that the IAN4L1 gene contains 3 exons.
Exon 1 is untranslated, and exon 3 contains more than 94% of the coding
sequence.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Stamm et al. (2002) mapped the IAN4L1 gene
to a 100-kb IMAP gene cluster on chromosome 7q32-q36. Within this
cluster, IMAP1 is located on the negative strand, while IMAP2 (608085),
IMAP3, and IMAP4 (608087) are on the opposite positive strand.

By interspecific backcross mapping, Daheron et al. (2001) mapped the
mouse Ian4 gene to the central region of chromosome 6.

ANIMAL MODEL

Biobreeding diabetes-prone (BBDP) rats homozygous for a frameshift
mutation in the Gimap5 gene, termed the lyp mutation, exhibit
spontaneous apoptosis of T lymphocytes, resulting in marked lymphopenia
and development of autoimmune type I diabetes (see 222100). Using flow
cytometry, Keita et al. (2007) found that T cells from lyp/lyp rats
showed loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. They proposed that
GIMAP5 regulates T-lymphocyte survival by mechanisms operating upstream
of mitochondria.

Barnes et al. (2010) identified a chemically induced recessive mutation,
which they called sphinx, in the mouse Gimap5 gene. Homozygous sphinx
mice, like Gimap5 -/- mice, were lymphopenic, showed granulocyte
accumulation, exhibited liver abnormalities, and died by age 14 weeks.
Further analysis of sphinx mice suggested that Gimap5 has cell-intrinsic
roles in lymphocyte survival, quiescence, and antigen receptor-induced
proliferation. Early morbidity of sphinx mice appeared to be due to
antibiotic-suppressible, microflora-dependent intestinal inflammation
and wasting disease. Barnes et al. (2010) proposed that GIMAP5 is a key
regulator of hematopoietic integrity and lymphocyte homeostasis.

604744	TITLE *604744 DIMETHYLARGININE DIMETHYLAMINOHYDROLASE 2; DDAH2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH; EC 3.5.3.18) regulates
cellular methylarginine concentrations, which in turn inhibit nitric
oxide synthase (see 163731) activity.

CLONING

Leiper et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding DDAHI (604743) and, by
screening a database of translated open reading frames with the deduced
DDAHI peptide sequence, identified DDAHII. Both DDAHI and DDAHII cDNAs
encode 285-amino acid proteins. The DDAHII amino acid sequence shares
98% identity with that of its mouse homolog and 62% identity with the
sequence of DDAHI. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.0-kb DDAHII
transcript expressed at highest levels in heart, kidney, and placenta.

By RNA dot blot analysis, Tran et al. (2000) determined that DDAH2
expression predominates in more highly vascularized tissues and in
immune tissues, while DDAH1 expression predominates in tissues that also
express the neuronal isoform of NOS (163731).

GENE FUNCTION

Leiper et al. (1999) expressed a histidine-tagged DDAHII clone in E.
coli and assayed the cell lysate for DDAH activity. Recombinant DDAHII
metabolized ADMA and L-NMMA, but not SDMA or L-arginine, demonstrating
that DDAHII is a functional homolog of DDAHI.

By overexpression in human and murine endothelial cells, Smith et al.
(2003) determined that DDAH2 reduced the secretion of ADMA, increased
VEGF mRNA expression, and enhanced tube formation by cells grown in a
3-dimensional medium. A DDAH inhibitor reduced tube formation in human
umbilical vein endothelial cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Genomic sequence analysis by Tran et al. (2000) indicated that DDAH2
contains 8 exons with 3 transcription start sites that generate
alternatively spliced transcripts.

MAPPING

Tran et al. (2000) mapped the DDAH2 gene to 6p21.3 by radiation hybrid
and FISH analysis.

611056	TITLE *611056 SELENOCYSTEINE LYASE; SCLY
;;SCL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Selenocysteine lyase (SCLY; EC 4.4.1.16) catalyzes the pyridoxal 5-prime
phosphate-dependent conversion of L-selenocysteine to L-alanine and
elemental selenium (Mihara et al., 2000).

CLONING

By database analysis using porcine Scly as probe, followed by screening
a mouse liver cDNA library and human EST libraries, Mihara et al. (2000)
cloned a full-length mouse Scly cDNA and identified a partial human SCLY
cDNA sequence. The deduced mouse protein has 432 amino acids. RT-PCR
detected Scly expression in mouse brain, heart, lung, stomach, liver,
kidney, spleen, and testis. Western blot analysis detected expression in
all mouse tissues examined, with the highest expression in liver,
kidney, and testis. Mouse Scly localized to the cytosolic fraction in
mouse liver and formed homodimers.

GENE FUNCTION

Mihara et al. (2000) showed that mouse Scly catalyzed the conversion of
L-selenocysteine to L-alanine. Scly activity required pyridoxal 5-prime
phosphate, was specific to L-selenocysteine, and showed maximum
reactivity at pH 9.0.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the human
SCLY gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP SHGC-81267).

300272	TITLE *300272 HISTONE DEACETYLASE 6; HDAC6
;;KIAA0901
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Histone acetylation (see HAT1; 603053) and deacetylation (see HDAC1;
601241) alternately exposes and occludes DNA to transcription factors.
There are at least 2 classes of HDACs, class I consisting of proteins
homologous to yeast Rpd3 (e.g., HDAC1, HDAC2 (605164), and HDAC3
(605166)) and class II consisting of proteins homologous to yeast Hda1
(e.g., HDAC4; 605314). HDAC6 belongs to class II.

CLONING

Nagase et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA encoding HDAC6, which they called
KIAA0901, from a brain cDNA library. RT-PCR analysis detected HDAC6
expression in all tissues tested, with highest expression in brain and
lowest expression in heart, spleen, and pancreas.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to yeast Hda1,
followed by screening a cDNA library and PCR, Grozinger et al. (1999)
identified cDNAs encoding the class II HDACs HDAC4, HDAC5 (605315), and
HDAC6. Sequence analysis predicted that the 1,216-amino acid HDAC6
protein consists of an apparent internal dimer containing 2 highly
homologous catalytic domains, the first beginning at residue 215 and the
second at residue 610. Northern blot analysis detected expression of a
5.0-kb HDAC6 transcript that was highest in heart, liver, kidney, and
pancreas. Functional analysis confirmed that HDAC6 possesses
deacetylation activity against all 4 core histones and that the 2
catalytic domains function independently. Western blot analysis showed
that HDAC6 is expressed as a 131-kD protein that does not
coimmunoprecipitate with other HDACs or transcription factors. Grozinger
et al. (1999) speculated that HDAC6 may not interact with histones in
vivo but may deacetylate other substrates.

Bertos et al. (2004) determined that the human HDAC6 protein contains 8
consecutive serine- and glutamic acid-containing tetradecapeptide (SE14)
repeats between the second deacetylase domain and the C-terminal
ubiquitin-binding zinc finger. The SE14 domain is not present in
orthologs from C. elegans, Drosophila, and mouse. HDAC6 also contains 2
nuclear export signals and a nuclear localization signal.

GENE FUNCTION

Hubbert et al. (2002) demonstrated that HDAC6 functions as a tubulin
deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where it
associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor
complex (see 601143). In vivo the overexpression of HDAC6 led to a
global deacetylation of alpha-tubulin (see 602529), whereas a decrease
in HDAC6 increased alpha-tubulin acetylation. In vitro, purified HDAC6
potently deacetylated alpha-tubulin in assembled microtubules.
Furthermore, overexpression of HDAC6 promoted chemotactic cell movement,
supporting the idea that HDAC6-mediated deacetylation regulates
microtubule-dependent cell motility. Hubbert et al. (2002) concluded
that HDAC6 is the tubulin deacetylase, and provided evidence that
reversible acetylation regulates important biologic processes beyond
histone metabolism and gene transcription.

Aggregates of misfolded proteins are transported and removed from the
cytoplasm by dynein motors via the microtubule network to an organelle
termed the aggresome, where they are processed. Kawaguchi et al. (2003)
identified HDAC6 as a component of the aggresome in human cells. HDAC6
could bind both polyubiquitinated misfolded proteins and dynein motors,
thereby recruiting misfolded protein cargo to dynein motors for
transport to aggresomes. Cells deficient in HDAC6 failed to clear
misfolded protein aggregates from the cytoplasm, could not form
aggresomes properly, and were hypersensitive to accumulation of
misfolded proteins.

Bertos et al. (2004) determined that the SE14 domain of HDAC6 was
dispensable for the deacetylase and ubiquitin-binding activities of
HDAC6, but it conferred acetyl-microtubule targeting. They further found
that HDAC6 maintained a cytoplasmic distribution in the presence of
leptomycin B, an inhibitor of nuclear export signals, and that the SE14
domain conferred leptomycin B resistance. The SE14 domain formed a
unique structure that caused monomeric HDAC6 to migrate at a molecular
mass of about 500 kD by gel filtration, rather than the predicted mass
of about 150 kD. Bertos et al. (2004) concluded that the cytoplasmic
distribution of HDAC6 is differentially regulated in mice and humans,
and that the SE14 domain serves to stably retain human HDAC6 in the
cytoplasm.

Kovacs et al. (2005) found that inactivation of HDAC6 in human embryonic
kidney cells led to HSP90 (see 140571) hyperacetylation, dissociation of
HSP90 from an essential cochaperone, p23 (607061), and loss of chaperone
activity. In HDAC6-deficient cells, HSP90-dependent maturation of the
glucocorticoid receptor (GCCR; 138040) was compromised, resulting in a
receptor defective in ligand binding, nuclear translocation, and
transcriptional activation. Kovacs et al. (2005) concluded that HSP90 is
a target of HDAC6 and that reversible acetylation is a mechanism that
regulates HSP90 chaperone complex activity.

Pandey et al. (2007) demonstrated in Drosophila that autophagy acts as a
compensatory degradation system when the ubiquitin proteasome system
(UPS) is impaired, and that HDAC6, a microtubule-associated deacetylase
that interacts with polyubiquitinated proteins, is an essential
mechanistic link in this compensatory interaction. The authors found
that compensatory autophagy was induced in response to mutations
affecting the proteasome and in response to UPS impairment in a fly
model of the neurodegenerative disease spinobulbar muscular atrophy.
Autophagy compensated for impaired UPS function in an HDAC6-dependent
manner. Furthermore, expression of HDAC6 was sufficient to rescue
degeneration associated with UPS dysfunction in vivo in an
autophagy-dependent manner. Pandey et al. (2007) concluded that
impairment of autophagy (i.e., associated with aging or genetic
variation) might predispose to neurodegeneration. Moreover, their
findings suggested that it may be possible to intervene in
neurodegeneration by augmenting HDAC6 to enhance autophagy.

Pugacheva et al. (2007) found that AURKA (603072) and its activator HEF1
(NEDD9; 602265) localized to the basal body and the second centriole in
quiescent ciliated human retinal pigment epithelial cells. Association
of AURKA with HEF1 in response to extracellular cues was required for
ciliary disassembly. Activation of AURKA was independently sufficient to
induce rapid ciliary resorption, and AURKA acted in this process through
phosphorylation of HDAC6, leading to HDAC6-dependent tubulin
deacetylation and destabilization of the ciliary axoneme. Small molecule
inhibitors of AURKA and HDAC6 reduced regulated disassembly of cilia.

An immediate response to cell stress is reversible blockade of mRNA
translation. Stalled mRNAs are sequestered into cytoplasmic stress
granules (SGs), which are complex assemblies of initiation factors and
proteins involved in translational control and RNA remodeling or
degradation, as well as 40S ribosome subunits and polyadenylated mRNAs
whose translation has been arrested. Kwon et al. (2007) showed that the
SG protein G3BP (608431) interacted with HDAC6 in vivo and in vitro and
that HDAC6 was recruited to SGs. Inhibition of HDAC led to impaired SG
assembly, and Hdac6-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts failed to form
SGs, although they exhibited normal phosphorylation of Eif2a (609234) in
response to stress. Inactivating mutations in the catalytic domains or
the C-terminal zinc finger domain of HDAC6 impaired SG assembly. Kwon et
al. (2007) also found that HDAC6 was required for cells to recover from
oxidative stress. They proposed that HDAC6 is a central component of the
stress response that regulates SG formation and potentially contributes
to control of RNA metabolism and translation.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Mahlknecht et al. (2001) mapped the HDAC6 gene
to chromosome Xp11.23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Chassaing et al. (2005) reported a 4-generation family segregating an
apparent X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia (300863) with features
including intrauterine growth retardation, hydrocephaly, rhizomelic
shortening, facial dysmorphism, and microphthalmia. Using X-linked
polymorphic microsatellite markers, Simon et al. (2010) performed
linkage analysis in the family described by Chassaing et al. (2005) and
mapped the disease locus to a 24-Mb interval on chromosome Xp11.3-q13.1
(lod = 3.30). By exon sequencing, Simon et al. (2010) identified a
variant in exon 29 of HDAC6, 281 bp after the translation termination
codon (c.*281A>T; 300272.0001) that completely segregated with the
disorder. The variant was located in the sequence corresponding to the
seed sequence of miR433 (611711). Transduction experiments with an HDAC6
3-prime UTR-bearing transgene showed that the mutation abrogated the
posttranscriptional regulation normally exerted by this microRNA.

CHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH PLATYSPONDYLY, DISTINCTIVE BRACHYDACTYLY, HYDROCEPHALY,
AND MICROPHTHALMIA (1 family)
HDAC6, 4023A-T

In the 4-generation family with X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia
described by Chassaing et al. (2005), Simon et al. (2010) detected an
A-to-T transversion in exon 29 of the HDAC6 gene, in the 3-prime
untranslated region 281 basepairs after the TAA translation termination
codon (c.*281A-T). The mutation completely cosegregated with the
disorder and was not found in SNP databases or in 100 control
individuals. The variant was located in the sequence corresponding to
the seed sequence of miR433 (611711). In MG63 osteosarcoma cells, miR433
downregulated both the expression of endogenous HDAC6 and that of an
enhanced green fluorescent protein-reporter mRNA bearing the wildtype
3-prime UTR of HDAC6. This effect was totally abrogated when the
reporter mRNA bore the mutated HDAC6 3-prime UTR. The HDAC6 protein was
overexpressed in thymus from an affected male fetus. Concomitantly, the
level of total alpha-tubulin (see 602529), a target of HDAC6, was
increased in the affected fetal thymus, whereas the level of acetylated
alpha-tubulin was profoundly decreased. Skin biopsies from a female
patient with striking body asymmetry expressed a mutated HDAC6 allele in
31% of affected arm-derived fibroblasts, whereas it was not expressed in
the contralateral arm. Overexpression of HDAC6 was also observed in
affected arm-derived fibroblasts. The authors concluded that the HDAC6
3-prime UTR variant suppressed miR433-mediated posttranscriptional
regulation, causing overexpression of HDAC6 and resulting in this form
of X-linked chondrodysplasia.

603940	TITLE *603940 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, SUBFAMILY K, MEMBER 7; KCNK7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the tandem pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, such
as TWIK1 (601745) and TREK (603219), contain 4 transmembrane domains and
2 pore-forming (P) domains. See KCNK6 (603939). By searching an EST
database for sequences related to mouse Kcnk6, Salinas et al. (1999)
isolated a human cDNA encoding a novel potassium channel, which they
designated KCNK7. RT-PCR revealed that exon skipping gives rise to 5
mRNA species encoding 3 protein forms, KCNK7-A, -B, and -C. The
predicted 307-amino acid KCNK7A form is the longest; KCNK7B and KCNK7C
have truncated cytoplasmic C termini. Sequence analysis revealed that
the KCNK7 protein contains 4 potential transmembrane segments and 2 P
domains. The P2 domain contains a very unconventional GLE motif instead
of the GLG found in TWIK1 and KCNK6 or the GFG found in other K2P
channels. The core region spanning the 4 transmembrane domains of KCNK7A
shares 80% and 42% protein sequence identity with those of Kcnk6 and
TWIK1, respectively. As with Kcnk6, none of the KCNK7 protein forms were
able to generate channel activity when expressed in mammalian cells.

MAPPING

By analysis of radiation hybrids, Salinas et al. (1999) mapped the KCNK7
gene to 11q13.

;;CYTOCHROME P450, PHENOBARBITAL-INDUCIBLE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Miles et al. (1988) reported the isolation of cDNA clones that seemed,
on the basis of their sequence homology to the rat P450IIB1 cDNA, to be
encoded by part of the human P450IIB subfamily. Evidence of alternative
splicing at the CYP2B locus was presented. Yamano et al. (1989)
demonstrated 2 anomalous cDNAs derived from the CYP2B locus on
chromosome 19.

GENE FUNCTION

Santisteban et al. (1988) were unable to demonstrate directly that
either P450IIA (CYP2A; see 122720) or IIB is inducible by phenobarbital
in man. However, they showed that members of both gene subfamilies are
inducible by phenobarbital in the marmoset monkey.

Thum and Borlak (2000) investigated the gene expression of major human
cytochrome P450 genes in various regions of explanted hearts from 6
patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 1 with transposition of the
arterial trunk and 2 samples of normal heart. mRNA for cytochrome 2B6
was predominantly expressed in the right ventricle. A strong correlation
between tissue-specific gene expression and enzyme activity was found.
Thum and Borlak (2000) concluded that their findings showed that
expression of genes for cytochrome P450 monooxgenases and verapamil
metabolism are found predominantly in the right side of the heart, and
suggested that this observation may explain the lack of efficacy of
certain cardioselective drugs.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mizukami et al. (1983) determined the structure of a rat
phenobarbital-inducible P-450 gene. The gene spans about 14 kb and has 8
introns. The putative transcription start site is located 30 bp upstream
of the ATG initiation codon and a TATA-like sequence is present 27 bp
farther 5-prime-ward. The 3-prime end contains a putative
polyadenylation signal 25 to 26 bp upstream of the poly(A) attachment
site. Mizukami et al. (1983) concluded that the gene they sequenced is
P-450e (Cyp2b2) or a similar gene. Presumably, all P-450 genes have a
similar structure.

MAPPING

Using a cloned cDNA that codes for a human ortholog of the
phenobarbital-inducible cytochrome P450IIB subfamily in rodents,
Santisteban et al. (1988) localized the CYP2B gene(s) to 19cen-q13.3 by
Southern blot hybridization to DNA extracted from a panel of
human-rodent somatic cell hybrids. The CYP2A locus is also located on
chromosome 19. Other members of the P450II family are located on
chromosome 10 (2C) and chromosome 22 (2D).

By Southern blot analysis of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids, Miles et
al. (1988) established the chromosomal localization of the CYP2B gene
subfamily to be 19q12-19q13.2, close to the location of CYP2A. Rat
chromosome 1 shows homology to mouse chromosome 7 and human chromosome
19 and contains the rat P450IIB genes. Southern blot analysis indicated
the distinctness of the CYP2A and CYP2B clusters. Miles et al. (1988)
used RFLPs of these loci to establish the linkage relationships.

CYP2B is in the same NotI fragment as CYP2A (Spurr, 1988). Although
CYP2A and CYP2B map to the same 350-kb pulsed field gel electrophoresis
fragment, recombination between them was observed by Walsh et al.
(1989), suggesting that they are separated by a recombination hotspot.
Yamano et al. (1989) confirmed the assignment to chromosome 19 using the
somatic cell hybrid method. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Trask
et al. (1993) assigned the CYP2B gene to 19q13.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Efavirenz, an effective antiretroviral agent used in the treatment of
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; see 609423) infection, is associated
with central nervous system side (CNS) effects (see 614546). Population
differences in pharmacokinetics and treatment response to the drug are
known. Haas et al. (2004) examined associations between CNS side effects
and efavirenz plasma concentration-time profiles and polymorphisms in
several genes, including CYP2B6, in 157 American HIV-infected patients.
They found that homozygosity for a nonsynonymous CYP2B6 SNP, 516G-T
(dbSNP rs3745274; 123930.0001), was present in 20% of African Americans
compared with only 3% of European Americans and was associated with
higher efavirenz exposure in plasma (P less than 0.0001). The median
24-hour area under the curve of efavirenz was about 3-fold higher in
516T homozygotes than in 516G homozygotes, and was intermediate in 516GT
heterozygotes, regardless of ethnicity, suggesting a gene dosage effect.
Among all patients, CNS side effects at week 1 were associated with 516T
(P = 0.036). There were no significant immunologic or virologic
differences for polymorphisms in any of the genes studied. Haas et al.
(2004) concluded that interindividual differences in drug metabolism
may, in part, explain susceptibility to efavirenz CNS side effects.

Blievernicht et al. (2007) used multiplex PCR and MALDI-TOF mass
spectrometry to genotype 15 SNPs of CYP2B6.

Watanabe et al. (2010) expressed wildtype CYP2B6 and 26 CYP2B6 variants
in COS-7 cells and assessed kinetic parameters against 2 substrates,
selegiline and 7-ethoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (7-EFC). They found
that 2 variants, CYP2B6.10 and CYP2B6.14, had significantly lower
Vmax/Km values for selegiline N-demethylation compared with wildtype
CYP2B6. The kinetic parameters for 9 other variants could not be
determined because they were inactive in the deethylation of 7-EFC and
the N-demethylation/N-depropaglyation of selegiline.

POPULATION GENETICS

By genotyping 100 healthy Mongolians, Davaalkham et al. (2009) found
that 7% of Mongolians were homozygous for the T allele of 516G-T,
whereas 64% were homozygous for the G allele. They noted that the
overall CYP2B6 allele distribution was comparable to that in Japanese,
Korean, and Han Chinese populations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Paolini et al. (1999) found significant increases in the
carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes CYP1A1 (108330), CYP1A2 (124060), CYP3A
(124010), CYP2B, and CYP2A in the lungs of rats supplemented with high
doses of beta-carotene. The authors suggested that correspondingly high
levels of CYPs in humans would predispose an individual to cancer risk
from the widely bioactivated tobacco-smoke procarcinogens, thus
explaining the cocarcinogenic effect of beta-carotene in smokers.

Haas et al. (2004) studied 157 American HIV-infected patients and found
that homozygosity for a nonsynonymous SNP in CYP2B6, 516G-T (dbSNP
rs3745274), which results in a gln172-to-his (Q172H) substitution, was
present in 20% of African Americans compared with only 3% of European
Americans and was associated with higher efavirenz exposure in plasma (P
less than 0.0001). The median 24-hour area under the curve of efavirenz
was about 3-fold higher in 516T homozygotes than in 516G homozygotes,
and was intermediate in 516GT heterozygotes, regardless of ethnicity,
suggesting a gene dosage effect. Among all patients, CNS side effects at
week 1 were associated with 516T (P = 0.036). Higher efavirenz
concentrations had no effect on HIV viral load.

Carr et al. (2010) determined plasma efavirenz concentrations in 219
HIV-positive Chilean patients and identified 11 CYP2B6 SNPs that were
significantly associated with drug concentrations. Of these, only 516G-T
(P = 5.6 x 10(-20)) was exonic. However, a composite model in which
516G-T was combined 2 other SNPs was more strongly associated with
efavirenz plasma concentrations than 516G-T alone.

Elens et al. (2010) studied 50 HIV-infected patients from Belgium and
confirmed that minimum trough plasma level concentrations of efavirenz
were associated with CYP2B6 allelic status. They also found that
cell-associated concentrations of efavirenz were associated with CYP2B6
516G-T. Elens et al. (2010) concluded that knowledge of CYP2B6 genetic
status should be taken into account for efavirenz treatment.

607209	TITLE *607209 CASPASE RECRUITMENT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 10; CARD10
;;CARD-MAGUK PROTEIN 3; CARMA3;;
BCL10-INTERACTING MAGUK PROTEIN 1; BIMP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The caspase recruitment domain (CARD) is a protein module that consists
of 6 or 7 antiparallel alpha helices. It participates in apoptosis
signaling through highly specific protein-protein homophilic
interactions. Like several other CARD proteins, CARD10 belongs to the
membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family and activates
NF-kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011) through BCL10 (603517) (Wang et al.,
2001).

CLONING

By database searching for CARD proteins with high similarity to, and
therefore a greater likelihood of interacting with, BCL10, Gaide et al.
(2001) identified CARD11 (607210), CARD14 (607211), and CARD10, which
they termed CARMA1, CARMA2, and CARMA3, respectively.

Using a mammalian 2-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact
with BCL10 and induce luciferase activity, Wang et al. (2001) identified
CARD10, which interacted selectively with BCL10 and not other CARD
proteins. The deduced 1,032-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal
CARD domain that shares 58% identity with that of CARD11, a central
coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal tripartite structure comprised of a
PDZ domain, an SH3 domain, and a GUK domain. Northern blot analysis
revealed expression of a 4.4-kb transcript in a variety of adult
tissues, including heart, kidney, and liver. CARD10 was also expressed
in fetal lung, liver, and kidney, and in multiple cancer cell lines.

McAllister-Lucas et al. (2001) cloned mouse and human CARD10, which they
termed BIMP1, by EST database searching for clones homologous to the
CARD of CARD9 (607212). The mouse Card10 protein is 90% identical to the
human protein.

GENE FUNCTION

By mutation and immunoprecipitation analyses, Wang et al. (2001)
confirmed that the CARD domain of CARD10 is required for its interaction
with BCL10. Luciferase reporter analysis showed induction of NFKB
activity through IKKG (IKBKG; 300248) or IKKB (IKBKB; 603258), and this
induction required the N terminus of CARD10, as well as its SH3 and PDZ
domains, but not its GUK domain.

By coprecipitation analysis, McAllister-Lucas et al. (2001) showed that
BIMP1, in the presence of BCL10, interacts with MALT1 (604860) and
cooperates in a signaling pathway through a CARD-mediated mechanism.
Analysis of stimulated T cells suggested that BIMP1, through its
interaction with BCL10, functions to couple cell surface receptor
stimulation and protein kinase C (see 176982) activation to the
induction of NFKB.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CARD10
gene to chromosome 22 (TMAP stSG53029).

ANIMAL MODEL

Grabiner et al. (2007) found that Carma3 +/- mice had no developmental
defects, but about 50% of Carma3 -/- mice developed anencephaly, leading
to perinatal mortality. Anencephaly is also present in about 50% of
Bcl10 -/- mice, supporting the hypothesis that CARMA3 and BCL10 function
in the same signal transduction pathway. Using Carma3 -/- mouse
embryonic fibroblasts, Grabiner et al. (2007) showed that Carma3 was
required for G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR; see 600239)-induced
NF-kappa-B activation. The defect was specific, because other stimuli,
such as Tnf-alpha (TNF; 191160), lipopolysaccharide, and extracellular
matrix proteins, activated NF-kappa-B in Carma3 -/- cells. Grabiner et
al. (2007) concluded that CARMA3 is involved in a GPCR-induced signaling
pathway leading to NF-kappa-B activation.

613400	TITLE *613400 ACIREDUCTONE DIOXYGENASE 1; ADI1
;;SUBMERGENCE-INDUCED PROTEIN-LIKE; SIPL;;
MT1-MMP CYTOPLASMIC TAIL-BINDING PROTEIN 1; MTCBP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a cDNA expression library for clones that permitted
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in HEK293 cells expressing
Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-1 (293EBNA cells), followed by
5-prime RACE of a normal liver cDNA library, Yeh et al. (2001) cloned
ADI1, which they called SIPL. The transcript contains a short upstream
ORF in addition to the major ORF. The deduced protein shares significant
similarity with rice Sip, which is induced by submergence in water.
Database analysis revealed a putative splice variant encoding a protein
with 63 additional N-terminal amino acids, which Yeh et al. (2001)
called 'extended SIPL' (ESIPL). Northern blot analysis failed to detect
SIPL in any tissue; however, RT-PCR followed by Southern blot analysis
detected SIPL in all normal and tumor tissues examined. ESIPL
transcripts were detected only in skeletal muscle and in hepatocellular
carcinoma, ovarian cancer, and placenta choriocarcinoma. Epitope-tagged
SIPL was expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of transfected 293
cells, with perinuclear or nuclear clustering in some cells. Database
analysis revealed SIPL orthologs in all organisms examined, including
prokaryotes.

GENE FUNCTION

Yeh et al. (2001) showed that 293EBNA cells expressing SIPL were
permissive for HCV infection, while untransfected cells were not.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Uekita et al. (2004) found that the
isolated C-terminal tail of MMP14 (600754) interacted with MTCBP1.
MTCBP1 colocalized with MMP14 at the cell membrane, but it was also
detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus. MTCBP1 inhibited the activity of
MMP14 to promote cell migration and invasion.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the ADI1 gene to chromosome 2p25.3 based on an
alignment of the ADI1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK001775) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

607021	TITLE *607021 SEIZURE-RELATED 6-LIKE; SEZ6L
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Allelic losses on 22q are frequently found in small cell lung carcinomas
(SCLCs) and advanced non-small cell lung carcinomas, indicating the
presence of tumor suppressor gene(s) on that chromosome arm. In an SCLC
cell line, Nishioka et al. (2000) detected a homozygous deletion at
22q12.1. Cloning of the breakpoints revealed that the deletion was
interstitial and was 428,131 bp in size. The deleted region contained
the SEZ6L (seizure 6-like) gene, whose structure had been partially
determined by the chromosome 22 sequencing project (Dunham et al.,
1999). The SEZ6L cDNA contains a 3,072-bp open reading frame encoding a
1,024-amino acid transmembrane protein with multiple domains involved in
protein-protein interaction and signal transduction. SEZ6L expression
was detected in a variety of human tissues, including lung, while its
expression was detected in 14 (30%) of 46 lung cancer cell lines
examined. Missense mutations were detected in 3 (7%) of 46 cell lines,
and a 1-bp deletion in the polypyrimidine tract preceding exon 4 was
detected in 1 (2%) of 46 primary lung cancers. Therefore, Nishioka et
al. (2000) considered it possible that genetic and/or epigenetic SEZ6L
alterations are involved in the development and/or progression in a
subset of lung cancer, although functional analysis of the SEZ6L gene as
well as molecular analysis of other genes in the homozygously deleted
region would be necessary in order to understand the pathogenetic
significance of 22q deletions in human lung carcinogenesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nishioka et al. (2000) concluded that the SEZ6L gene consists of 17
exons within a 210-kb region.

MAPPING

Nishioka et al. (2000) identified the SEZ6L gene within a deletion at
chromosome 22q12.1.

GENE FUNCTION

SEZ6L was one of the genes studied by Suzuki et al. (2002) in a
microarray genome screen for genes upregulated by demethylation and
histone deacetylase inhibition in human colorectal cancer.

600285	TITLE *600285 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION TERMINATION FACTOR 1; ETF1
;;RELEASE FACTOR 1; RF1;;
ERF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Termination of protein biosynthesis and release of the nascent
polypeptide chain are signaled by the presence of an in-frame stop codon
at the aminoacyl site of the ribosome. The process of translation
termination is universal and is mediated by protein release factors
(RFs) and GTP. A class 1 RF recognizes the stop codon and promotes the
hydrolysis of the ester bond linking the polypeptide chain with the
peptidyl site tRNA, a reaction catalyzed at the peptidyl transferase
center of the ribosome. Class 2 RFs, which are not codon specific and do
not recognize codons, stimulate class 1 RF activity and confer GTP
dependency upon the process. In prokaryotes, both class 1 RFs, RF1 and
RF2, recognize UAA; however, UAG and UGA are decoded specifically by RF1
and RF2, respectively. In eukaryotes, eRF1, or ETF1, the functional
counterpart of RF1 and RF2, functions as an omnipotent RF, decoding all
3 stop codons (Frolova et al., 1994).

CLONING

Frolova et al. (1994) characterized a family of tightly related proteins
from lower and higher eukaryotes that are structurally and functionally
similar to rabbit RF. Two of these proteins, one from human and the
other from Xenopus laevis, were expressed in yeast and Escherichia coli,
respectively, purified, and shown to be active in the in vitro RF assay.
Another protein of this family, sup45 (sup1) of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, is involved in omnipotent suppression during translation.
The amino acid sequence of the RF1 family is highly conserved. Frolova
et al. (1994) concluded that the RF1 proteins are directly implicated in
the termination of translation in eukaryotes.

GENE FUNCTION

Eukaryotic RF1 and RF3 (see GSPT1; 139259) are involved in translation
termination. In vitro, RF1 catalyzes the release of the polypeptide
chain without any stop codon specificity; the GTP-binding protein RF3
confers GTP dependence to the termination process and stimulates RF1
activity. Le Goff et al. (1997) used tRNA-mediated nonsense suppression
of different stop codons in a CAT reporter gene to analyze the
polypeptide chain release factor activities of recombinant human RF1 and
RF3 proteins overexpressed in human cells. Using a CAT assay, they
measured the competition between the suppressor tRNA and the release
factors when a stop codon was present in the ribosomal A site.
Regardless of which of the 3 stop codons was present in the CAT open
reading frame, the overexpression of RF1 alone markedly decreased
translational read-through by suppressor tRNA. Thus, Le Goff et al.
(1997) concluded that RF1 has intrinsic antisuppressor activity. The
levels of antisuppression when both RF1 and RF3 were overexpressed were
almost the same as those when RF1 was overexpressed alone, suggesting
that RF1-RF3 complex-mediated termination may be controlled by the
expression level of RF1. Overexpression of RF3 alone had an inhibitory
effect on CAT gene expression. CAT mRNA stability studies suggested that
RF3 inhibits gene expression at the transcriptional level. Le Goff et
al. (1997) suggested that RF3 may perform other functions, including the
stimulation of RF1 activity, in vivo.

Alkalaeva et al. (2006) reconstituted eukaryotic translation initiation,
elongation, and termination processes in vitro on a model mRNA encoding
a tetrapeptide followed by a UAA stop codon using individual 40S and 60S
ribosomal subunits and the complete set of individual initiation,
elongation, and release factors. They found that binding of human ERF1
and ERF3A (GSPT1) and GTP to the ribosomal pretermination complex
induced a structural rearrangement characterized by a 2-nucleotide
forward shift of the toeprint attributed to the pretermination complex.
Subsequent GTP hydrolysis was required for rapid hydrolysis of peptidyl
tRNA in the pretermination complex. Cooperativity between ERF1 and ERF3A
in ensuring fast peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis required the ERF3A-binding
C-terminal domain of ERF1.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Song et al. (2000) determined the crystal structure of ETF1 to
2.8-angstrom resolution, which, when combined with mutagenesis analyses
of the universal GGQ motif, revealed the molecular mechanism of RF
activity. The overall shape and dimensions of ETF1 resemble a tRNA
molecule, with domains 1, 2, and 3 of ETF1 corresponding to the
anticodon loop, aminoacyl acceptor stem, and T stem of a tRNA molecule,
respectively. The position of the essential GGQ motif at an exposed tip
of domain 2 suggested to the authors that the gln residue coordinates a
water molecule to mediate the hydrolytic activity at the peptidyl
transferase center. Song et al. (2000) proposed that a conserved groove
on domain 1, 80 angstroms from the GGQ motif, forms the codon
recognition site.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lai et al. (2001) determined that the ETF1 gene contains 10 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hansen et al. (1999) mapped the ETF1 gene
to chromosome 5q31.1. Guenet et al. (2000) confirmed the mapping of the
ETF1 gene to 5q31 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

300162	TITLE *300162 ACETYLSEROTONIN METHYLTRANSFERASE-LIKE; ASMTL
;;ACETYLSEROTONIN METHYLTRANSFERASE-LIKE, X-LINKED; ASMTLX
DESCRIPTION The human Y chromosome is an extreme case with respect to recombination
frequencies. Over most of its entire length, the Y chromosome is
virtually a nonrecombining chromosome. At its distal ends, however,
within the 2 X-Y homologous pseudoautosomal regions (PAR1 and PAR2),
recombination frequencies are extremely high. Indeed, PAR1 on Xp/Yp
exhibits one of the highest recombination rates in male meiosis in the
human genome. This is due to the fact that males have an obligatory
crossover within the 2.6-Mb region of PAR1 (Rappold, 1993). The
preponderance of gene families expressed specifically in the testes has
been described on the nonrecombining portion of the human Y chromosome
(Lahn and Page, 1997). This has raised questions about the evolutionary
forces that led to their creation as well as to the molecular mechanisms
involved. In contrast, the evolution of genes and gene families in the
recombining portion of Y is likely to follow very different principles.
For example, the high frequency of recombination may have rendered this
region more prone to unequal crossing over, leading to gene duplications
in the ancestral PAR1 region. Ried et al. (1998) stated that to that
time 9 genes and 1 pseudogene had been characterized within PAR1. Only 2
of them, ASMT (300015) and XE7 (312095), had been characterized as
'single' genes, whereas all the others had close relatives in the genome
or were duplicated within PAR1. In this connection, Ried et al. (1998)
isolated a novel pseudoautosomal gene, ASMTL (N-acetylserotonin
O-methyltransferase-like), showing significant homology to the ASMT
gene. ASMT is an enzyme catalyzing the last step in the synthesis of
melatonin, a hormone that depresses body temperature and facilitates
sleep onset by inducing the circadian rhythm. It is exclusively
expressed in brain, retina, and pineal gland. Besides the homology of
ASMTL to ASMT in its 3-prime part, the N-terminal part of ASMTL is
similar to the entire length of the multicopy associated filamentation
(maf) protein of Bacillus subtilis and to orfE of Escherichia coli, gene
products involved in the regulation of cell division and growth. The
bipartite structure suggested that ASMTL is the product of a gene fusion
event, during which 2 different full-length genes are joined to form a
single gene. Ried et al. (1998) also detected the identity of 1 exon
(1A) of ASMT to exon 3 in yet another pseudoautosomal gene, XE7. The
data suggested that exon duplication and exon shuffling as well gene
fusion may represent common characteristics of the evolution of the
pseudoautosomal region.

Ried et al. (1998) found that ASMTL resides proximal to and in the close
vicinity of ANT3 (300151). The cosmid used in the initial cDNA selection
approach contained not only the 3-prime end of ASMTL but also the entire
ANT3 gene. ANT3 had previously been shown to be associated with a CpG
island located approximately 1,300 kb from the telomere. Sequencing
indicated that the 5-prime end of ASMTL is located approximately 1,350
kb from Xptel. Thus, the homologous genes ASMTL and ASMT (previously
mapped 1,700-1,800 kb from Xptel) reside within 500 kb in the middle
portion of PAR1.
