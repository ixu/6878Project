610284	TITLE *610284 LIPOYLTRANSFERASE 1; LIPT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In mammals, lipoyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.181) catalyzes the second of 2
steps in the covalent attachment of lipoic acid to lipoate-dependent
proteins, including the glycine cleavage system H protein (GCSH; 238330)
and the dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2) subunits of the pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex (DLAT; 608770), the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
complex (DLST; 126063), and the branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase
complex (DBT; 248610) (Fujiwara et al., 1999).

CLONING

Using a bovine lipoyltransferase cDNA fragment as probe, Fujiwara et al.
(1999) cloned human LIPT1 from a liver cDNA library. The deduced
373-amino acid precursor protein shares 88% and 31% sequence identity
with bovine lipoyltransferase II and E. coli lipoate-protein ligase A,
respectively. By alignment of LIPT1 with the bovine lipoyltransferase
amino acid sequence, Fujiwara et al. (1999) predicted that the
N-terminal 26 amino acids comprise a mitochondrial targeting sequence,
with the threonine-27 corresponding to the first residue of the mature
enzyme. Thus, the deduced mature LIPT1 enzyme contains 347 amino acids
with a calculated molecular mass of 39.539 kD. Northern blot analysis
detected a major 1.5-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in skeletal muscle and heart, followed by liver, brain,
placenta, and lung.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fujiwara et al. (1999) determined that the LIPT1 gene contains 4 exons
and spans 8 kb of genomic DNA. They found evidence of several LIPT1
transcripts resulting from alternative splicing in the 5-prime
untranslated region.

MAPPING

By FISH, Fujiwara et al. (1999) mapped the LIPT1 gene to chromosome
2q11.2.

;;REGULATOR OF CULLINS 2; ROC2;;

SENSITIVE TO APOPTOSIS GENE; SAG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Reactive oxygen species (ROS), a group of very reactive, short-lived
chemicals produced during normal respiratory processes or after
oxidative insults, may mediate apoptosis. Metal chelators and metal ions
are redox-sensitive agents that can mediate ROS generation. The metal
chelator 1,10-phenanthroline (OP) induces or suppresses apoptosis in a
cell line-dependent manner. Using differential display, Duan et al.
(1999) isolated mouse cDNAs associated with OP-induced apoptosis. One
cDNA encoded Gss (601002), and the other encoded a novel protein
produced by a gene that they designated Sag. The authors used the mouse
Sag cDNA to identify a HeLa cell cDNA corresponding to human SAG. The
predicted 113-amino acid human SAG protein is 97% identical to mouse
Sag. The C-terminal half of SAG consists of a zinc RING finger domain.
Northern blot analysis revealed that SAG was ubiquitously expressed,
with the highest levels in heart, skeletal muscle, and testis.
Immunofluorescent staining indicated that SAG localized in both the
cytoplasm and nuclei of mammalian cells.

By searching databases for homologs of ROC1 (RBX1; 603814), followed by
PCR of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Ohta et al. (1999) cloned RNF7, which
they called ROC2. The deduced 85-amino acid ROC2 protein shares 51%
identity with ROC1 and 35% identity with human APC11 (ANAPC11; 614534),
a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex. Both ROC proteins are
highly evolutionarily conserved. ROC1 and ROC2 both contain a RING
finger domain and are rich in tryptophan.

GENE FUNCTION

Duan et al. (1999) found that, in vitro, recombinant human SAG bound to
zinc and copper metal ions and prevented lipid peroxidation induced by
copper or a free radical generator. When overexpressed in human cell
lines, SAG protected cells from apoptosis induced by redox agents such
as OP. Duan et al. (1999) concluded that SAG is a cellular protective
molecule that appears to act as an antioxidant to inhibit apoptosis
induced by metal ions and ROS.

By yeast 2-hybrid and immunoprecipitation analyses, Ohta et al. (1999)
found that human ROC1 and ROC2 commonly interacted with all cullins (see
603134). They concluded that combinations of ROC/APC11 and cullin
proteins potentially constitute a wide variety of ubiquitin ligases.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Duan et al. (1999) mapped the SAG
gene to chromosome 3q22-q24.

600267	TITLE *600267 PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, NONRECEPTOR-TYPE, 13; PTPN13
;;PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE PTPL1;;
FAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE 1; FAP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a PCR-based approach, Saras et al. (1994) cloned a cytoplasmic
protein tyrosine phosphatase of nonreceptor type, which they designated
PTPL1. Overlapping cDNA clones encompassed an open reading frame of
7,398 bp, predicting a 2,466-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of
275 kD. PTPL1 was found to have a wide tissue distribution, a 9.5-kb
transcript being expressed in most tissues. PTPL1 has a protein-tyrosine
phosphatase domain located in the C terminus. In the nonenzymatic part
of PTPL1, 3 different structural motifs were identified; 2 of these are
often found in proteins at the interface between the plasma membrane and
the cytoskeleton, namely, a domain with similarity to the band 4.1
(130500) superfamily, and a region consisting of 5 copies of an 80-amino
acid repeat found in a variety of cytoskeleton-associated proteins. In
addition, PTPL1 has a leucine zipper motif. Saras et al. (1994) noted
that PTPL1 was the largest known PTP and the only one known to contain a
leucine zipper motif. Its structure suggests that it may be able to form
dimers and may localize to the submembranous cytoskeleton.

Both Banville et al. (1994) and Maekawa et al. (1994) isolated the same
nonreceptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase, PTPN13, which they
referred to as hPTP1E and PTP-BAS, respectively. Maekawa et al. (1994)
originally isolated a PCR product from basophil mRNA using degenerate
primers and RT-PCR. This was used as a probe to screen a
basophil-enriched KU812E cell cDNA library. The fully characterized cDNA
was over 8.1 kb and encoded a 2,485-amino acid predicted reading frame.
The Banville et al. (1994) cDNA was isolated by screening a ZR-75-1
breast carcinoma cell line at low stringency with a probe for LAR cDNA
(179590). The cDNA they identified was over 8.3 kb long and encoded a
2,490-amino acid reading frame. Both groups noted that the N-terminal
region contains motifs showing similarity to the GLGF motifs found in
guanylate kinase proteins that may play a role in the subcellular
distribution of these proteins within specialized structures of the cell
membrane where cell-cell interactions occur. Maekawa et al. (1994)
presented evidence for alternative splicing producing at least 3
different isoforms of PTPN13. Banville et al. (1994) expressed the
protein in E. coli and showed that the recombinant protein had the
expected protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity. Northern blot analysis
showed expression in a variety of tissues with especially high levels in
the kidney, lung, and fetal brain.

PTPN13 binds to a negative regulatory domain in Fas that inhibits
Fas-induced apoptosis; it has therefore also been called Fas-associated
protein-tyrosine-1 (FAP1) (Inazawa et al., 1996).

GENE STRUCTURE

Yoshida et al. (2002) determined that the PTPN13 gene is located only
633 bp upstream from JNK3 (602897) in a head-to-head orientation. A
short G/C-rich region between the cap sites of the 2 genes suggested
that they might share a bidirectional promoter region that appears to
contain multiple cis elements. They found that the PTPN13 gene, which
contains 48 exons, initiates transcription within exon 2 and terminates
in exon 48.

MAPPING

Banville et al. (1994) assigned the PTPN13 gene to chromosome 11 by PCR
of somatic cell hybrid DNAs. In an erratum, they stated that the gene
had been assigned to chromosome 4 and not 11 as reported.

Inazawa et al. (1996) localized the PTPN13 gene to 4q21.3 by both
fluorescence in situ hybridization and PCR analysis of somatic cell
hybrids. They noted that the 4q21.3 chromosomal region contains a gene
for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (173910) and is
frequently deleted in liver and ovarian cancers.

The assignment to 4q21 was confirmed by van den Maagdenberg et al.
(1996) who also mapped the gene to mouse chromosome 5.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wang et al. (2004) performed a mutational analysis of the tyrosine
phosphatase gene superfamily in human cancers and identified 83 somatic
mutations in 6 protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPRF, 179590; PTPRG,
176886; PTPRT, 608712; PTPN3, 176877; PTPN13; and PTPN14, 603155),
affecting 26% of colorectal cancers and a smaller fraction of lung,
breast, and gastric cancers. Fifteen mutations were nonsense,
frameshift, or splice site alterations predicted to result in truncated
proteins lacking phosphatase activity. Wang et al. (2004) biochemically
examined 5 missense mutations in PTPRT, the most commonly altered
protein-tyrosine phosphatase, and found that they reduced phosphatase
activity. Expression of wildtype but not a mutant PTPRT in human cancer
cells inhibited cell growth. Wang et al. (2004) concluded that their
observations suggested that the mutated tyrosine phosphatases are tumor
suppressor genes, regulating cellular pathways that may be amenable to
therapeutic intervention.

118661	TITLE *118661 VERSICAN; VCAN
;;CHONDROITIN SULFATE PROTEOGLYCAN 2; CSPG2;;
CHONDROITIN SULFATE PROTEOGLYCAN CORE PROTEIN, CARTILAGE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans were first identified in hyaline
cartilage, where they specifically interact with hyaluronan and form
large supramolecular complexes. Together with other matrix
glycoproteins, they provide mechanical support and a fixed negative
charge. Such molecules exist also in a variety of soft tissues where
they may play additional physiologic roles (Kjellen and Lindahl, 1991).

CLONING

Zimmermann and Ruoslahti (1989) cloned and sequenced the cDNA of the
core protein of fibroblast chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. They
designated it versican in recognition of its versatile modular
structure. Decorin (125255) and biglycan (301870) are 2 other soft
tissue proteoglycans.

Naso et al. (1995) reported that the mouse versican protein is 89%
identical to human versican and is highly expressed in mouse embryos at
days 13, 14, and 18.

Dours-Zimmermann and Zimmermann (1994) provided evidence for the
existence of 3 versican splice variants, designated V0, V1, and V2,
which differ in the length of their glycosaminoglycan attachment portion
inserted between the globular modules at the N- and C-terminal ends of
the core proteins. Versican V1 and V2 include either the GAG-alpha or
the GAG-beta domain providing attachment sites for about 5 to 8 or 12 to
15 glycosaminoglycan chains, respectively. In the V0 variant, both
GAG-alpha and GAG-beta are present. Zako et al. (1995) demonstrated the
existence of another splice variant, designated V3, which lacks a
chondroitin sulfate attachment region, the most distinctive portion of a
proteoglycan molecule.

Bode-Lesniewska et al. (1996) studied the distribution of versican by
using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies that recognize the core
protein of the prominent versican splice variants V0 and V1. Versican
was present in the loose connective tissues of various organs and was
often associated with the elastic fiber network. It was localized in
most smooth muscle tissues and in fibrous and elastic cartilage.
Versican staining was noted in the central and peripheral nervous
system, in the basal layer of the epidermis, and on the luminal surface
of some glandular epithelia. In blood vessels, versican was present in
all 3 wall layers of veins and elastic arteries. In muscular arteries
the immunoreactivity was normally restricted to the tunica adventitia.
However, it appeared in the media and the split elastica interna of
atherosclerotically transformed vessel walls.

GENE STRUCTURE

Naso et al. (1994) showed that the human versican gene contains 15 exons
spanning more than 90 kb. One of these, exon 7, is used in an
alternative splice variant. The authors sequenced the 5-prime
promoter-containing region of the gene and found that it contained
numerous binding sites for transactivators such as AP2 (107580) and Sp1
(189906). They used transient transfection studies to show that the
promoter functioned well in both mesenchymal and epithelial cells. The
authors used deletion studies to show that this 5-prime region (to
approximately -630) contains both strong enhancer and strong negative
regulatory elements.

MAPPING

The distinctness of CSPG1 (AGC1; 155760) and CSPG2 was uncertain until
both genes had been mapped. Whereas CSPG1 is located on chromosome 15,
Iozzo et al. (1992) demonstrated that the CSPG2 gene is located on
chromosome 5. They used a combination of human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids including a panel of hybrids containing partial deletions of
chromosome 5 and narrowed the assignment to 5q12-q14, with the precise
site likely to be 5q13.2, by in situ hybridization.

Using interspecific backcross analysis, Naso et al. (1995) assigned the
Cspg2 gene to mouse chromosome 13 in a region that is syntenic with 5q.

GENE FUNCTION

To determine whether TP53 (191170) gene dosage affects transcriptional
regulation of target genes, Yoon et al. (2002) performed oligonucleotide
array gene expression analysis by using human cells with wildtype p53 or
with 1 or both TP53 alleles disrupted by homologous recombination. They
identified 35 genes, including CSPG2, whose expression was significantly
correlated to the dosage of TP53. Motif search analysis revealed that
CSPG2 contains a p53 consensus binding site in its first intron. In
vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that CSPG2 is directly
transactivated by p53.

To understand how cancer cells infect the inflammatory microenvironment,
Kim et al. (2009) conducted a biochemical screen for
macrophage-activating factors secreted by metastatic carcinomas. They
demonstrated that, among the cell lines screened, Lewis lung carcinoma
(LLC) were the most potent macrophage activators leading to production
of interleukin-6 (IL6; 147620) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-alpha; 119160) through activation of the Toll-like receptor family
members TLR2 (603028) and TLR6 (605403). Both TNF-alpha and TLR2 were
found to be required for LLC metastasis. Biochemical purification of
LLC-conditioned medium led to identification of the extracellular matrix
proteoglycan versican, which is upregulated in many human tumors
including lung cancer, as a macrophage activator that acts through TLR2
and its coreceptors TLR6 and CD14 (158120). By activating TLR2:TLR6
complexes and inducing TNF-alpha secretion by myeloid cells, versican
strongly enhances LLC metastatic growth. Kim et al. (2009) concluded
that their results explained how advanced cancer cells usurp components
of the host innate immune system, including bone marrow-derived myeloid
progenitors, to generate an inflammatory microenvironment hospitable for
metastatic growth.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wagner vitreoretinopathy (WGVRP; 143200) is an autosomal dominant
vitreoretinopathy. Miyamoto et al. (2005) demonstrated a heterozygous
A-to-G transversion at the second base of the 3-prime acceptor splice
site of intron 7 of the CSPG2 gene that cosegregated with the disease in
a Japanese family (118661.0001).

In the large 5-generation Swiss family with vitreoretinopathy originally
described by Wagner (1938), Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2006) identified
a heterozygous splice site mutation in intron 8 of the VCAN gene
(118661.0002) that segregated fully with disease.

In affected members of 7 Dutch families with vitreoretinopathy,
Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for 3 splice site
mutations in intron 7 of the VCAN gene (118661.0003-118661.0005).
Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient blood samples revealed a highly
significant (p less than 0.0001) and consistent increase in the V2 and
V3 splice variants (more than 38-fold and more than 12-fold,
respectively) in all patients with intron 7 nucleotide changes, as well
as in a Chinese family with vitreoretinopathy in which a causal variant
was not identified. Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) suggested that Wagner
vitreoretinopathy is caused by an imbalance of versican isoforms,
mediated by intronic variants.

In a 4-generation French family with a severe vitreoretinal disorder
mapping to 5q13-q14, Brezin et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous
splice site mutation in intron 7 of the VCAN gene (118661.0006) that
segregated with disease and was not found 100 French controls.

In a British family and a French family with Wagner vitreoretinopathy,
Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) sequenced the VCAN gene and identified
2 heterozygous splice site mutations, in intron 8 and intron 7 of the
VCAN gene, respectively, that segregated with disease in each family
(118661.0007 and 118661.0008). The levels of splice variants V2 and V3
were significantly increased in all patient fibroblast and blood samples
from these families as well as samples from the Swiss family with
vitreoretinopathy originally described by Wagner (1938), although the
magnitude of the increase varied between tissues and mutations. There
were no statistically significant differences in V0 and V1 levels in
fibroblasts or blood between patients and controls.

In a Japanese family with Wagner syndrome (143200) in which members of 4
generations, to a total of 13 with 11 living at the time of study, were
affected, Miyamoto et al. (2005) described a heterozygous splice
acceptor site mutation in the CSPG2 gene: 4004-2 A-G. Results of RT-PCR
analysis indicated that the mutation activated a cryptic splice site
located 39 bp downstream from the authentic 3-prime splice acceptor
site.

In a large 5-generation Swiss family with vitreoretinopathy (143200),
originally described by Wagner (1938), Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous transition (9265+1G-A) at the highly conserved
splice donor sequence in intron 8 of the VCAN gene, which segregated
with the phenotype in 21 affected and 26 unaffected family members and
was not found in 104 control alleles. RT-PCR analysis using patient RNA
from venous blood revealed 2 aberrant CSPG2 transcripts, 1 lacking the
entire exon 8 and the other missing only the last 21 bp of exon 8.

Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) analyzed fibroblasts from a member of
the Swiss family with vitreoretinopathy originally described by Wagner
(1938) and found a 700-fold and a 150-fold increase in versican isoforms
V2 and V3, respectively, compared to controls. In patient blood samples,
amounts of V2 and V3 were increased 48-fold and 32-fold, respectively.

VCAN, IVS7AS, T-C, -5

In all affected individuals from 5 Dutch families with vitreoretinopathy
(143200), including 4 families diagnosed with Wagner syndrome and 1 with
erosive vitreoretinopathy, Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) identified
heterozygosity for a transition in intron 7 (4004-5T-C) of the VCAN
gene. The mutation was not found in unaffected individuals from any of
the 5 families, or in 250 Dutch controls. The 5 families shared a common
haplotype on chromosome 5q14, suggesting a founder mutation.
Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient blood samples revealed a highly
significant (p less than 0.0001) and consistent increase in the V2 and
V3 splice variants (more than 38-fold and more than 12-fold,
respectively) compared to controls.

In affected members of a Dutch family with Wagner vitreoretinopathy
(143200), Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a
transition in intron 7 (4004-5T-A) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was
not found in unaffected members of the family, or in 250 Dutch controls.
RT-PCR analysis of mutant versican transcripts showed activation of a
cryptic splice site resulting in a 39-nucleotide in-frame deletion of
exon 8 in splice variant V0. Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient
blood samples revealed a highly significant (p less than 0.0001) and
consistent increase in the V2 and V3 splice variants (more than 45-fold
and more than 13-fold, respectively) compared to controls.

In affected members of a Dutch family with Wagner vitreoretinopathy
(143200), Mukhopadhyay et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a
transition in intron 7 (4004-1G-A) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was
not found in unaffected members of the family, or in 250 Dutch controls.
RT-PCR analysis of mutant versican transcripts showed activation of a
cryptic splice site resulting in a 39-nucleotide in-frame deletion of
exon 8 in splice variant V0. Quantitative PCR using RNA from patient
blood samples revealed a highly significant (p less than 0.0001) and
consistent increase in the V2 and V3 splice variants (more than 137-fold
and more than 22-fold, respectively) compared to controls.

.0006
WAGNER VITREORETINOPATHY
VCAN, IVS7AS, A-T, -2

In 10 affected members of a 4-generation French family with severe
vitreoretinopathy (1432300), Brezin et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a transversion within the highly conserved acceptor
splice site of intron 7 (4004-2A-T) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was
not found in 6 unaffected family members or in 100 French controls.
Patients in this kindred had a highly variable phenotype, including
exudative vascular abnormalities, and exhibited severe visual
impairment. RT-PCR analysis of patient lymphoblastoid cell RNA indicated
that the mutation activates a cryptic acceptor splice site within exon
8, located 39 bp downstream from the authentic 3-prime splice acceptor
site. Direct sequencing of a shortened RNA fragment showed loss of the
first 39 bp of exon 8, predicted to cause in-frame deletion of 13 amino
acid residues from the beginning of the GAG-beta domain of mature
versican. RT-PCR also indicated aberrant expression of a versican mRNA
lacking the entire exon 8.

In 3 affected members of a 4-generation British family with Wagner
vitreoretinopathy (143200), previously studied by Fryer et al. (1990),
Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a
transition within the conserved splice donor site of intron 8
(9265+2T-A) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was not found in 300 control
alleles. In patient blood samples, there was a 230-fold and a 143-fold
increase in versican isoforms V2 and V3, respectively, compared to
controls.

WAGNER VITREORETINOPATHY
VCAN, IVS7, G-C, -1

In 19 affected members of a 4-generation French family with Wagner
vitreoretinopathy (143200), originally reported by Zech et al. (1999),
Kloeckener-Gruissem et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a
transversion within the conserved splice acceptor site of intron 7
(4004-1G-C) of the VCAN gene. The mutation was not found in 19
unaffected family members or in 300 control alleles. In patient
fibroblasts, there was an 80-fold and a 150-fold increase in versican
isoforms V2 and V3, respectively, compared to controls, whereas in
patient blood samples, amounts of V2 and V3 increased 64-fold and
6-fold, respectively.

300598	TITLE *300598 G ANTIGEN 5; GAGE5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Human melanoma cells express several distinct antigens that are
recognized by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs). One class of
these antigens is encoded by genes, such as MAGE1 (MAGEA1; 300016),
MAGE3 (MAGEA3; 300174), and BAGE (605167), that are expressed in a large
fraction of tumors of various histologic types but are silent in normal
adult tissues, except for testis. Van den Eynde et al. (1995) identified
GAGE1 (300594) as a gene encoding an antigen that is present on melanoma
MZ2-MEL cells and is recognized by autologous CTLs. By screening a
melanoma MZ2-MEL cDNA library with a GAGE1 cDNA, they isolated cDNAs
representing 5 genes with sequence similarity to GAGE1. They named the
genes GAGE2 (GAGE2C; 300595), GAGE3 (300596), GAGE4 (300597), GAGE5, and
GAGE6 (300599). The GAGE2 to -6 cDNAs differ mainly by single nucleotide
substitutions that are scattered throughout the sequence. The deduced
GAGE5 protein has 117 amino acids. RT-PCR using primers common to GAGE1
to -6 found expression of these genes in various tumors but no
expression in any normal adult tissue tested except testis.

MAPPING

Chen et al. (2006) determined that GAGE5 is 1 of several copies of a
GAGE gene repeated on chromosome Xp11.23.

601988	TITLE *601988 LIM DOMAIN KINASE 2; LIMK2
DESCRIPTION Okano et al. (1995) isolated a human cDNA encoding LIMK2, a second
member of the LIMK family, with a domain structure similar to LIMK1
(601329) and 50% overall amino acid identity with LIMK1. They also
identified 2 alternative transcripts, LIMK2a and LIMK2b, which are
probably due to variation in transcriptional initiation. The 3.7-kb
LIMK2 mRNA was detected in all tissues tested, with the highest level in
placenta and a moderate level in liver, lung, kidney, and pancreas,
whereas the 1.6-kb mRNA was detected only in skeletal muscle and heart.
The 3.7-kb transcript was detected in lung, stomach, and renal cancer
cell lines. Osada et al. (1996) found that LIMK2a transcripts were more
abundant than LIMK2b in liver, colon, stomach, and spleen, while in
brain, kidney, and placenta LIMK2b transcripts were the dominant form.
The former encodes a protein containing 2 LIM domains, a PDZ domain, and
a kinase domain, while the latter has only 1.5 LIM domains. (The LIM
domain is thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions; the
PDZ domain was originally recognized in a family of proteins related to
the Drosophila lethal discs-large tumor suppressor gene product Dlga
(see 601014) and was shown to function in protein-protein interactions
targeting the protein to the submembranous compartment.) Transfection
studies have shown an association of 63-kD and 58-kD proteins with the
LIMK2a and LIMK2b proteins. The former is distributed in the cytoplasm
and nucleus and the latter occurs mainly in the cytoplasm. A truncated
LIMK2-kinase has a nuclear location, not showing the protein
association. Okano et al. (1995) demonstrated the
serine/threonine-specific kinase activity of LIMK1 and LIMK2 by in vitro
analysis.

Maekawa et al. (1999) demonstrated that LIM kinase is phosphorylated and
activated by ROCK (601702), a downstream effector of Rho, and that LIM
kinase, in turn, phosphorylates cofilin (601442), inhibiting its
actin-depolymerizing activity. They concluded that this pathway
contributes to Rho-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.

603590	TITLE *603590 ACETYLGLUCOSAMINYLTRANSFERASE-LIKE PROTEIN; LARGE
;;KIAA0609;;
LIKE-GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Peyrard et al. (1999) investigated the gene content of a segment of
22q12.3-q13.1 that had been shown to contain meningioma-related genes
(156100) on the basis of studies of deletions. They characterized a
novel member of the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase gene family, which
they designated the LARGE gene. The expression pattern of the human and
mouse LARGE orthologs is similar. Both genes are expressed ubiquitously,
consistent with their function as housekeeping genes. These genes are
also evolutionarily well conserved, as Peyrard et al. (1999) identified
an ortholog in C. elegans encoding a polypeptide that is 33% identical
with the human protein.

Brockington et al. (2005) noted that the 756-amino acid LARGE protein
contains an N-terminal transmembrane domain, a coiled-coil domain, and 2
catalytic domains.

GENE STRUCTURE

Peyrard et al. (1999) determined that the LARGE gene spans more than 664
kb of genomic DNA, making it the fifth largest in the human genome,
after dystrophin (DMD; 300377), with 2.3 Mb; DCC (120470), with 1.4 Mb;
GRM8 (601116), with 1 Mb; and utrophin (UTRN; 128240), with 900 kb. The
LARGE gene contains 16 exons (4,326-bp cDNA) and has an exon content of
less than 0.66%, which is similar to the exon content of the DMD gene
(0.6%).

MAPPING

Peyrard et al. (1999) mapped the LARGE gene to chromosome 22q12.3-q13.1,
a segment apparently poor in genes. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Peyrard et al. (1999) mapped the mouse Large gene to 8C1
in a region of conserved synteny with 22q12.3-q13.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Kanagawa et al. (2004) showed that both the N-terminal domain and a
portion of the mucin-like domain of alpha-dystroglycan (DAG1; 128239)
are essential for high-affinity laminin receptor function. They found
that posttranslational modification of alpha-dystroglycan by LARGE
occurs within the mucin-like domain, but the N-terminal domain interacts
with LARGE, defining an intracellular enzyme-substrate recognition motif
necessary to initiate functional glycosylation. Gene replacement in
dystroglycan-deficient muscle demonstrated that the dystroglycan
C-terminal domain is sufficient only for dystrophin-glycoprotein complex
assembly. To prevent muscle degeneration, expression of a functional
dystroglycan through LARGE recognition and glycosylation was required.
The authors concluded that molecular recognition of dystroglycan by
LARGE is a key determinant in the biosynthetic pathway to produce mature
and functional dystroglycan.

Brockington et al. (2005) transfected various cell lines with a variety
of LARGE expression constructs in order to characterize their
subcellular localization and effect on alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation.
Wildtype LARGE colocalized with the Golgi marker GM130 and stimulated
alpha-dystroglycan hyperglycosylation. The 2 predicted catalytic domains
of LARGE contain 3 conserved DxD motifs. Systematically mutating each of
these motifs to NNN resulted in the mislocalization of 1 construct, and
all failed to have any effect on alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation. A
construct lacking the transmembrane domain also failed to localize at
the Golgi apparatus. Brockington et al. (2005) concluded that LARGE
needs to both physically interact with alpha-dystroglycan and function
as a glycosyltransferase in order to stimulate alpha-dystroglycan
hyperglycosylation.

Inamori et al. (2012) found that LARGE could act as a bifunctional
glycosyltransferase, with both xylosyltransferase and
glucuronyltransferase activities, which produced repeating units of
[-3-xylose-alpha-1,3-glucuronic acid-beta-1-]. This modification allowed
alpha-dystroglycan to bind laminin-G-domain-containing extracellular
matrix ligands.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mutation in the LARGE gene can cause 2 different forms of muscular
dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (MDDG): a severe congenital form with brain
and eye anomalies (type A6; MDDGA6, 613154), formerly designated
Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) or muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB), and a
less severe congenital form with mental retardation (type B6; MDDGB6;
608840), formerly designated congenital muscular dystrophy type 1D
(MDC1D).

Longman et al. (2003) studied 36 patients with congenital muscular
dystrophy (CMD) and either mental retardation, structural brain changes,
or abnormal alpha-dystroglycan immunolabeling, who were unlinked to any
known CMD loci. Among 29 families in which linkage to the LARGE gene was
not excluded, sequence analysis identified 1 patient who was compound
heterozygous for mutations in the LARGE gene: E509K (603590.0001) and a
1-bp insertion (1999insT; 603590.0002). The affected 17-year-old girl
presented with congenital muscular dystrophy, profound mental
retardation, and white matter changes and subtle structural
abnormalities on brain MRI (MDDGB6; 608840).

In a patient with muscle-eye-brain disease (MDDGA6; 613154), Clement et
al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
LARGE gene (603590.0005 and S331F, 603590.0006). The patient had
congenital muscular dystrophy, increased serum creatine kinase, mental
retardation, and myopia. Brain MRI showed ventricular dilatation,
abnormal white matter changes, cerebellar cysts, dysplastic cerebellar
vermis, posterior concavity of the brainstem, pontine hypoplasia with a
cleft, and frontoparietal polymicrogyria.

In 2 Saudi sibs with Walker-Warburg syndrome (613154), born of
consanguineous parents, van Reeuwijk et al. (2007) identified a
homozygous 63-kb intragenic deletion in the LARGE gene (603590.0003).

In 1 of 81 Italian patients with congenital muscular dystrophy and
defective glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, Mercuri et al. (2009)
identified a homozygous mutation in the LARGE gene (W495R; 603590.0004).
The phenotype was consistent with Walker-Warburg syndrome.

In a patient with LARGE-related congenital muscular dystrophy, Clement
et al. (2008) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the LARGE
gene (603590.0007 and 603590.0001).

In 2 sisters with LARGE-related congenital muscular dystrophy, Clarke et
al. (2011) identified a homozygous insertion/deletion in the LARGE gene
(603590.0008). Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the mutation.

EVOLUTION

Sabeti et al. (2007) reported an analysis of over 3 million
polymorphisms from the International HapMap Project Phase 2. The
analysis revealed more than 300 strong candidate regions that appeared
to have undergone recent natural selection. Examination of 22 of the
strongest regions highlighted 3 cases in which 2 genes in a common
biologic process had apparently undergone positive selection in the same
population: LARGE and DMD (300377), both related to infection by the
Lassa virus, in West Africa; SLC24A5 (609802) and SLC45A2 (606202), both
involved in skin pigmentation, in Europe; and EDAR (604095) and EDA2R
(300276), both involved in the development of hair follicles, in Asia.

ANIMAL MODEL

Grewal et al. (2001) found that the mouse myodystrophy (myd) mutation
resides in the mouse homolog of the LARGE gene. They found that an
intragenic deletion of exons 4-7 causes a frameshift in the resultant
mRNA and a premature termination codon before the first of the 2
catalytic domains. On immunoblots, a monoclonal antibody to
alpha-dystroglycan, a component of the dystrophin-associated
glycoprotein complex (DGC), showed reduced binding in myd, which they
attributed to altered glycosylation of this protein. They speculated
that abnormal posttranslational modification of alpha-dystroglycan may
contribute to the myd phenotype.

Michele et al. (2002) demonstrated in both muscle-eye-brain disease and
Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (see 253800) patients that
alpha-dystroglycan is expressed at the muscle membrane, but similar
hypoglycosylation in the diseases directly abolishes binding activity of
dystroglycan for the ligands laminin (see 150240), neurexin (see
600565), and agrin (103320). Michele et al. (2002) showed that this
posttranslational biochemical and functional disruption of
alpha-dystroglycan is recapitulated in the muscle and central nervous
system of myd mice. Michele et al. (2002) demonstrated that myd mice
have abnormal neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and
hippocampus, and show disruption of the basal lamina. In addition, myd
mice reveal that dystroglycan targets proteins to functional sites in
brain through its interactions with extracellular matrix proteins.
Michele et al. (2002) suggested that at least 3 mammalian genes function
within a convergent posttranslational processing pathway during the
biosynthesis of dystroglycan and that abnormal dystroglycan-ligand
interactions underlie the pathogenic mechanism of muscular dystrophy
with brain abnormalities.

Holzfeind et al. (2002) showed that the muscular dystrophy phenotype is
not confined to skeletal muscle in the myd (Large-myd) mouse.
Immunohistochemistry indicated disruption of the dystrophin-associated
glycoprotein complex in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Mutant skeletal
muscle showed a general increase in the expression of DGC proteins and
of dysferlin (DYSF; 603009) and caveolin-3 (CAV3; 601253). In contrast,
the expression of DGC proteins was reduced in cardiac muscle. Overlay
assays showed loss of laminin (LAM1; 150320) binding by
alpha-dystroglycan in Large-myd skeletal and cardiac muscle and in
brain. Electroretinograms of homozygous mutant mice showed gross
abnormalities of b-wave characteristics, indicative of a complex defect
in retinal transmission. The laminar architecture of the cortices of the
cerebrum and the cerebellum was disturbed, suggesting defective neuronal
migration.

Glycosyltransferase deficiency is a pathogenic mechanism that has been
identified in several congenital muscular dystrophies and results in
abnormal glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. In myd mice, Barresi et
al. (2004) found that overexpression of transduced Large ameliorated the
dystrophic phenotype and induced synthesis of glycan-enriched alpha-DG
with high affinity for extracellular ligands. In myoblasts from patients
with Fukuyama muscular dystrophy, muscle-eye-brain disease, and
Walker-Warburg syndrome, overexpression of LARGE resulted in increased
expression of glycosylated alpha-DG and organization of laminin on the
cell surface. The findings suggested that LARGE does not activate the
mutant enzyme in each disorder, but that it is an essential component of
the glycosylation machinery of alpha-DG. Rando (2004) reviewed this
approach to the treatment of muscular dystrophies by enhancing
glycosylation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY-DYSTROGLYCANOPATHY (CONGENITAL WITH MENTAL RETARDATION),
TYPE B, 6
LARGE, GLU509LYS

In a 17-year-old girl with congenital muscular dystrophy, profound
mental retardation, white matter changes, and subtle brain structural
abnormalities (MDDGB6; 608840), Longman et al. (2003) identified
compound heterozygosity for mutations in the LARGE gene. One mutation
was a 1525G-A transition in exon 13 resulting in a substitution of
lysine for glutamate-509, a highly conserved residue in the putative
second catalytic domain; the other was a 1-bp insertion (1999insT;
603590.0002) in exon 15, predicted to result in a frameshift and
premature stop signal at codon 693, truncating the putative second
catalytic domain. The patient's skeletal muscle biopsy showed reduced
immunolabeling of alpha-dystroglycan. Immunoblotting with an antibody to
a glycosylated epitope demonstrated a reduced molecular weight form of
alpha-dystroglycan that retained some laminin-binding activity.

Brockington et al. (2005) showed that LARGE mutants E509K and 1999insT
had no effect on alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation and failed to localize
correctly to the Golgi apparatus, confirming their pathogenicity.

In a patient with LARGE-related congenital muscular dystrophy and mental
retardation (608840), Clement et al. (2008) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the LARGE gene: E509K and a frameshift
(667fs; 603590.0007). The patient was a 14-year-old individual with had
mental retardation, nystagmus, abnormal electroretinogram, and increased
serum creatine kinase. Brain MRI showed periventricular and temporal
white matter changes, posterior concavity of the brainstem, hypoplastic
pons, and frontoparietal pachygyria. The patient was identified in a
larger study of 27 patients with a dystroglycanopathy.

LARGE, 63-KB DEL

In 2 Saudi sibs with Walker-Warburg syndrome (MDDGA6; 613154), born of
consanguineous parents, van Reeuwijk et al. (2007) identified a
homozygous 63-kb intragenic deletion in the LARGE gene, including part
of intron 8, exon 9, intron 9, exon 10, and most of intron 10. At birth,
both showed severe hypotonia, absent deep tendon reflexes, widened
anterior fontanels, and ophthalmic changes, including cataract, optic
atrophy, and retinal dysplasia. Both had increased serum creatine kinase
and dystrophic muscle biopsies. Brain CT scan showed ventricular
dilatation, absence of the inferior cerebellar vermis, and hypoplastic
cerebellum; 1 of the sibs had hydrocephalus and Dandy-Walker
malformation. The sibs died at age 6 and 2 months, respectively. The
unaffected parents were heterozygous for the deletion.

In a patient with Walker-Warburg syndrome (MDDGA6; 613154), Mercuri et
al. (2009) identified a homozygous 1483T-C transition in the LARGE gene,
resulting in a trp495-to-arg (W495R) substitution in a highly conserved
residue needed to correct nucleotide-disphosphosugar transferase
activity. The patient had increased serum creatine kinase, absent
alpha-dystroglycan (128239) on muscle biopsy, mental retardation, and
had only achieved head control.

In a patient with muscle-eye-brain disease (MDDGA6; 613154), Clement et
al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
LARGE gene: 1 resulting in a frameshift at gln87, and the other in a
ser331-to-phe substitution (S331F; 603590.0006). The patient had
congenital muscular dystrophy, increased serum creatine kinase, mental
retardation, and myopia. Brain MRI showed ventricular dilatation,
abnormal white matter changes, cerebellar cysts, dysplastic cerebellar
vermis, posterior concavity of the brainstem, pontine hypoplasia with a
cleft, and frontoparietal polymicrogyria.

LARGE, 42.9-KB INS/4.1-KB DEL

In 2 sisters, born of consanguineous Lebanese parents with congenital
muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy with mental retardation (608840),
Clarke et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 40.8- to 42.9-kb insertion
between exons 10 and 11 of the LARGE gene, predicted to introduce a
premature stop codon in the mRNA transcript, resulting in truncation of
the LARGE protein midway through translation. The insertion was
associated with 3.0- to 4.1-kb deletion of a central region of intron
10, but the exact breakpoints of the deletion/insertion were not found,
suggesting that an even more complex rearrangement may have occurred.
The abnormal insertion sequence mapped to a part of a spliced EST
normally located 100-kb centromeric to the LARGE gene. The girls had
moderate mental retardation, marked cerebellar hypoplasia, dilated
ventricles, and white matter abnormalities; 1 had pachygyria.

;;EIF3-p110;;
EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 3, SUBUNIT 8, FORMERLY; EIF3S8,
FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Eukaryotic initiation factor-3 (eIF3) is the largest of the eIFs and
consists of at least 10 nonidentical subunits, including EIF2C (Asano et
al., 1997).

CLONING

Asano et al. (1997) demonstrated that the 115-kD component of HeLa cell
eIF3 is actually composed of 2 proteins, p116 (PRT1; 603917) and p110.
By screening a HeLa cell expression library with antibodies against the
115-kD band, these authors identified cDNAs encoding p110. The predicted
913-amino acid p110 protein has a pI of 5.8 and is unrelated to p116.
p110 shares 31% identity to the S. cerevisiae Nip1 protein, which is
thought to be involved in nuclear import and the initiation phase of
protein synthesis. Asano et al. (1997) found that the p116, p110, and
p36 (603911) subunits localize on 40S ribosomes in cells active in
translation and coimmunoprecipitate with p170 (602039), indicating that
these proteins are integral components of eIF3. Northern blot analysis
revealed that p110 is expressed as a 3-kb mRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

By reciprocal yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses of the
human STS26T malignant schwannoma cell line, Scoles et al. (2006) showed
that isoforms 1 and 2 of schwannomin (NF2; 607379) interacted with
EIF3C. Mutation analysis revealed that the FERM domain of schwannomin
interacted with the C-terminal half of EIF3C. Immunofluorescence
microscopy of STS26T cells showed that the 2 proteins partly colocalized
at punctate perinuclear structures and at some membranous structures.
Overexpression of EIF3C in STS26T cells elevated cell proliferation, and
schwannomin countered this effect. Western blot analysis revealed an
inverse abundance of schwannomin and EIF3C in human meningiomas.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the EIF3C gene to chromosome 16p11.2 based on an
alignment of the EIF3C sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC000533) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37). A nearly identical copy of EIF3C, designated
EIF3CL, also maps to chromosome 16p11.2.

601627	TITLE *601627 SURVIVAL OF MOTOR NEURON 2; SMN2
;;SURVIVAL OF MOTOR NEURON, CENTROMERIC COPY; SMNC;;
C-BCD541
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The SMN1 (600354) and SMN2 genes lie within the telomeric and
centromeric halves, respectively, of a large, inverted duplication on
chromosome 5q13. These genes share more than 99% nucleotide identity,
and both are capable of encoding a 294-amino acid RNA-binding protein,
SMN, that is required for efficient assembly of small nuclear
ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes. Homozygous loss of the SMN1 gene
causes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA; 253300). Absence of SMN1 is
partially compensated for by SMN2, which produces enough SMN protein to
allow for relatively normal development in cell types other than motor
neurons. However, SMN2 cannot fully compensate for loss of SMN1 because,
although SMN2 is transcribed at a level comparable to that of SMN1, a
large majority of SMN2 transcripts lack exon 7, resulting in production
of a truncated, less stable SMN protein (Lefebvre et al., 1995; Kashima
et al., 2007).

CLONING

Lefebvre et al. (1995) described an inverted duplication of a 500-kb
element in normal chromosome 5q13, which contains the gene for spinal
muscular atrophy. Within the telomeric region, they identified the SMN1
gene. A highly homologous gene, referred to as C-BCD541 and also known
as SMNC or SMN2, was present in the duplicated centromeric element in
95% of controls. PCR amplification and sequence analysis revealed 5
nucleotide discrepancies between the centromeric and telomeric SMN
genes, 2 of which occur in exons 7 and 8. The centromeric SMN gene
undergoes alternative splicing of exon 7, resulting in a truncated mRNA
transcript lacking exon 7 and a putative protein with a different
C-terminal end.

Using a panel of anti-SMN antibodies, Coovert et al. (1997) demonstrated
that the SMN protein is expressed from both the SMN1 and SMN2 genes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Burglen et al. (1996) determined that the SMN gene has 9 exons and spans
approximately 20 kb. Burglen et al. (1996) referred to exon 2 as exons
2a and 2b.

Boda et al. (2004) determined that the first 4.6 kb of the SMN1 and SMN2
promoters are identical. The promoters contain 12 SP1 (189906), 8 AP1
(see 165160), 3 AP2 (107580), 6 HNF3 (see 602294), 24 Zeste (see
601674), and 4 RXR-beta (180246) sites. There are no RE1 elements. Boda
et al. (2004) transfected primary cultures of mouse embryonic spinal
cord and fibroblasts with constructs containing 1.8, 3.2, or 4.6 kb of
the promoter region fused to a reporter gene. Expression of the 1.8- and
3.2-kb constructs was stronger in spinal cord than in fibroblast
cultures; the 4.6-kb construct gave 5-fold higher expression in neurons
than in fibroblasts, with expression in fibroblasts lower than that
achieved with the 3.2-kb construct. Boda et al. (2004) concluded that
these results suggest the presence of an enhancer element between 1.8
and 3.2 kb upstream from the transcriptional start site of the SMN genes
that functions in both culture types, and a silencer between 3.2 and 4.6
kb that is active only in fibroblast cultures.

MAPPING

Lefebvre et al. (1995) determined that the SMN2 gene lies within the
centromeric half of a large inverted duplication on chromosome 5q13. The
SMN1 gene lies in the telomeric half of the duplication.

GENE FUNCTION

Monani et al. (1999) sequenced 3 genomic clones over 32 kb in length,
which spanned both the SMN1 and SMN2 genes. Of 35 sequence differences
noted between SMN1 and SMN2, only 3 were located in either exon 7 or
intron 7. Of note was a translationally silent 840C-T transition at
position +6 in exon 7, which affects splicing. Using minigene
constructs, the authors found that the presence of cytosine at position
+6 in exon 7 produced a normal splicing pattern retaining exon 7,
whereas thymine in this position resulted in the absence of exon 7 in
the majority of the transcripts. Since the majority of human SMN2
transcripts lack exon 7, the authors hypothesized that the 5-prime
portion of exon 7 in SMN1 contains an exonic splice enhancer (ESE), and
that low levels of full-length SMN transcript are responsible for the
SMA phenotype.

Andreassi et al. (2001) screened a library of compounds and found that
aclarubicin increased the retention of exon 7 into the SMN2 transcript
from the endogenous gene in type I SMA fibroblasts, as well as from an
SMN2 minigene in a motor neuron cell line. In type I fibroblasts,
treatment resulted in an increase in SMN protein and gems to normal
levels. The authors demonstrated the utility of high-throughput screens
in detecting compounds that affect the splicing pattern of a gene, and
suggested that alteration of splicing patterns may represent a feasible
approach to modification of gene expression in disease treatment.

Using in vivo splicing assays, Hofmann and Wirth (2002) identified the
protein hnRNPG (300199) and its paralog RBM (400006) as 2 novel splicing
factors that promote the inclusion of SMN2 exon 7. Both hnRNPG and RBM
nonspecifically bind RNA, but directly and specifically bind
Htra2-beta1, an SR-like splicing factor which stimulates inclusion of
exon 7 through a direct interaction with SMN2 exon 7 pre-mRNA. Using
deletion mutants of hnRNPG, the authors demonstrated a specific
protein-protein interaction of hnRNPG with Htra2-beta1 which mediates
the inclusion of SMN2 exon 7 rather than the nonspecific interaction of
hnRNPG with SMN pre-mRNA. These trans-acting splicing factors were also
effective on endogenous SMN2 transcripts and increased the endogenous
SMN protein level. The authors presented a model of how exon 7 mRNA
processing may be regulated by these splicing factors.

Kashima and Manley (2003) showed that the exonic splicing silencer in
SMN2 functions as a binding site for a known repressor protein, HNRNPA1
(164017), which binds to SMN2 but not SMN1 exon 7 RNA. By using small
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to reduce HNRNPA1 protein levels in living
cells, Kashima and Manley (2003) demonstrated efficient SMN2 exon 7
splicing. The findings not only defined a new mechanism underlying the
inefficient splicing of SMN2 exon 7 but also illustrated more generally
the remarkable sensitivity and precision that characterizes control of
mRNA splicing. The work also made it possible to consider therapeutic
approaches to spinal muscular atrophy that involved decreasing HNRNPA1
RNA binding to or function on SMN2 exon 7.

Helmken et al. (2003) stated that sibs with identical 5q13 homologs and
homozygous absence of SMN1 can have variable phenotypes, suggesting that
the spinal muscular atrophy phenotype is modified by other factors,
which function either on the transcriptional level, to produce more
full-length SMN (FL-SMN) transcripts, or on the translational level, to
increase the amount of SMN2 protein. By analyzing 9 SMA discordant
families, Helmken et al. (2003) demonstrated that in all families
unaffected sibs produced significantly higher amounts of SMN,
SMN-interacting protein-1 (SIP1; 602595), GEMIN3 (606168), ZPR1
(603901), and hnRNPQ protein in lymphoblastoid cell lines, but not in
primary fibroblasts, compared with their affected sibs. The results
suggested that the modifying factor or factors act on the SMN gene to
influence SMN protein levels, thus modifying the SMA phenotype, and not
through an independent pathway. In addition, the observed coregulations
appeared to be tissue-specific. SMN significantly coregulated its
interacting partners, including its own splicing factor, HTRA2-beta-1
(see 606441), due to an indirect feedback mechanism. Thus, Helmken et
al. (2003) showed that reduction of the SMN protein has a significant
impact on the expression level of a splicing factor.

Brichta et al. (2003) showed that in fibroblast cultures derived from
SMA patients treated with therapeutic doses of valproic acid, the level
of full-length SMN2 mRNA/protein increased 2- to 4-fold. This
upregulation of SMN was most likely attributable to increased levels of
HTRA2-beta-1 as well as to SMN gene transcription activation. Valproic
acid also increased SMN protein levels through transcription activation
in organotypic hippocampal rat brain slices. Additionally, valproic acid
increased the expression of other serine-arginine family proteins, which
may have important implications for other disorders affected by
alternative splicing.

Grzeschik et al. (2005) reported that cultured lymphocytes from patients
with SMA showed increased production of the full-length SMN mRNA and
protein in response to treatment with hydroxyurea. The findings
suggested that hydroxyurea promoted inclusion of exon 7 during SMN2
transcription.

Kernochan et al. (2005) investigated the levels of acetylated H3 and H4
histones and histone deacetylases (HDACs) associated with different
regions of the human and mouse SMN genes in both cultured cells and
tissues. The SMN gene had a reproducible pattern of histone acetylation
that was largely conserved among different tissues and species. A
limited region of the promoter surrounding the transcriptional start
site had relatively high levels of histone acetylation. After HDAC
inhibitor treatment, acetylated histone levels increased, particularly
at upstream regions, correlating with a 2-fold increase in promoter
activity. During development in mouse tissues, histone acetylation
levels decreased and associated HDAC2 (605164) levels increased at the
region closest to the transcriptional start site, correlating with a 40
to 60% decrease in SMN transcript and protein levels. Kernochan et al.
(2005) suggested that histone acetylation may modulate SMN gene
expression.

Skipping of SMN2 exon 7 had been attributed to either the loss of an
SF2/ASF-dependent exonic splicing enhancer or the creation of an hnRNP
A/B-dependent exonic splicing silencer, as a result of the C-to-T
transition. Cartegni et al. (2006) reported the extensive testing of the
enhancer-loss and silencer-gain models by mutagenesis, RNA interference,
overexpression, RNA splicing, and RNA-protein interaction experiments.
The results supported the enhancer-loss model but also demonstrated that
hnRNP A/B proteins antagonize SF2/ASF-dependent ESE activity and promote
exon 7 skipping by a mechanism that is independent of the C-to-T
transition and is, therefore, common to both SMN1 and SMN2. The findings
explained the basis of defective SMN2 splicing, illustrated the fine
balance between positive and negative determinants of exon identity and
alternative splicing, and underscored the importance of antagonistic
splicing factors and exonic elements in a disease context.

Kashima et al. (2007) showed that the 840C-T transition in SMN2 created
a high-affinity HNRNPA1-binding site. Depletion of HNRNPA1 in HeLa cells
restored exon 7 inclusion, indicating that splicing of exon 7 in SMN2 is
repressed by an HNRNPA1-dependent exonic splicing silencer.

Kashima et al. (2007) identified a novel single nucleotide difference
between SMN1 and SMN2, an A-to-G change at position +100 within intron 7
of SMN2, which creates a second high-affinity HNRNPA1-binding site
specific to SMN2. Base substitutions that disrupted this site in SMN2
restored exon 7 inclusion in vivo and prevented HNRNPA1 binding in
vitro. Kashima et al. (2007) proposed that interactions between HNRNPA1
molecules bound to the exonic and intronic sites cooperate to exclude
exon 7 in SMN2.

Angelozzi et al. (2008) found that salbutamol increased full-length SMN2
mRNA transcript levels in fibroblasts derived from patients with SMA.
The maximum increase (over 200%) was observed after 30 to 60 minutes.
This rapid rise correlated with decreased levels of SMN2 mRNA with
deletion of exon 7. Salbutamol treatment also resulted in increased SMN
protein levels and nuclear gems.

Using SMN minigenes, Gladman and Chandler (2009) identified 2 elements
within intron 7 of the SMN genes that influenced exon 7 splicing in a
cell type-independent manner.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Spinal Muscular Atrophy

Hahnen et al. (1996) reported molecular analysis of 42 SMA patients who
carried homozygous deletions of exon 7 but not of exon 8 in the
telomeric copy of the SMN gene (SMN1). Additional homozygous deletions
of exon 8 in the centromeric copy of SMN (SMN2) were found in 2 of the
patients. By a simple PCR test, they demonstrated the existence of
hybrid SMN genes, i.e., genes composed of both the centromeric SMN2 and
the telomeric SMN1. They reported a high frequency of hybrid SMN genes
in SMA patients with Czech or Polish background. Hahnen et al. (1996)
identified a single haplotype for half of the hybrid genes analyzed,
suggesting that in these cases the SMA chromosomes shared a common
origin.

Schwartz et al. (1997) used solid-phase minisequencing to determine the
ratio between the number of telomeric and centromeric copies of the SMN
gene in affected and unaffected members of 30 SMA families. Six
predominant haplotypes were identified, 3 for normal chromosomes and 3
for SMA chromosomes, characterized by having 0, 1, or 2 copies,
respectively, of SMN2. They found patients homozygous for a deletion of
SMN1 and with only one copy of SMN2, but found none deleted for all
copies of SMN2. Several asymptomatic carriers of SMA with only a single
copy of SMN1 and no copy of SMN2 were identified. Schwartz et al. (1997)
could not confirm the hypothesis that the presence of more copies of
SMN2 is correlated with a less severe course of the disease. The
frequencies of haplotypes characterized by having 0, 1, or 2 copies,
respectively, of SMN2 were found to differ significantly between normal
and SMA chromosomes. This distribution could be explained by an
underrepresentation of the haplotype completely lacking SMN genes, which
is expected to cause early embryonic death in homozygotes.

Srivastava et al. (2001) reported a 5-year-old boy with childhood-onset
SMA who had a homozygous deletion of SMN2. He had wasting, weakness, and
hyporeflexia, predominantly in the distal muscles. The affected muscles
showed chronic neurogenic changes on electromyography. There was no
sensory involvement. A nerve conduction study showed near-normal
conduction velocity with reduction in the amplitude of the compound
muscle action potential. The SMN2 deletion was demonstrated by studies
of exons 7 and 8 of the SMN genes. Base sequencing and densitometric
analysis of the critical exon 7 region did not show any microdeletion or
duplication of SMN1, but confirmed the deletion of SMN2. Srivastava et
al. (2001) concluded that deletion of SMN2 can also result in the SMA
phenotype.

Feldkotter et al. (2002) developed a quantitative test for either SMN1
or SMN2 to analyze SMA patients for their SMN2 copy number and to
correlate the SMN2 copy number with type of SMA and duration of
survival. The quantitative analysis of SMN2 copies in 375 patients with
type I, type II, or type III SMA showed a significant correlation
between SMN2 copy number and type of SMA as well as duration of
survival. Thus, 80% of patients with type I SMA carried 1 or 2 SMN2
copies and 82% of patients with type II SMA carried 3 SMN2 copies,
whereas 96% of patients with type III SMA carried 3 or 4 SMN2 copies.
Among 113 patients with type I SMA, 9 with 1 SMN2 copy lived less than
11 months, 88 of 94 with 2 SMN2 copies lived less than 21 months, and 8
of 10 with 3 SMN2 copies lived 33 to 66 months. On the basis of SMN2
copy number, Feldkotter et al. (2002) calculated the posterior
probability that a child with homozygous absence of SMN1 will develop
type I, type II, or type III SMA.

Ogino et al. (2004) analyzed all 'available and reliable' data to
calculate allele/haplotype frequencies and new mutation rates in the SMN
region. The authors stated that their data provided the basis for the
most accurate genetic risk calculations as well as evidence that
nucleotide position 840 constitutes a mutation hotspot. Ogino et al.
(2004) suggested that there is selection of the single-copy SMN1-SMN2
haplotype and that rare chromosomes with 3 copies of SMN1 exist.

Wirth et al. (2006) analyzed SMN2 copy number in 115 patients with SMA3
(253400) or SMA4 (271150) who had confirmed homozygous absence of SMN1
and found that 62% of SMA3 patients with age of onset less than 3 years
had 2 or 3 SMN2 copies, whereas 65% of SMA3 patients with age of onset
greater than 3 years had 4 to 5 SMN2 copies. Of the 4 adult-onset (SMA4)
patients, 3 had 4 SMN2 copies and 1 had 6 copies. Wirth et al. (2006)
concluded that SMN2 may have a disease-modifying role in SMA, with a
greater SMN2 copy number associated with later onset and better
prognosis.

Hauke et al. (2009) demonstrated that SMN2 is subject to gene silencing
by DNA methylation. SMN2 contains 4 CpG islands which present highly
conserved methylation patterns and little interindividual variation in
SMN1-deleted SMA patients. The comprehensive analysis of SMN2
methylation in patients suffering from severe versus mild SMA carrying
identical SMN2 copy numbers revealed a correlation of CpG methylation at
the positions -290 and -296 with disease severity and the activity of
the first transcriptional start site of SMN2 at position -296. The
methyl-CpG-binding protein-2 (MECP2; 300005), a transcriptional
repressor, bound to the critical SMN2 promoter region in a
methylation-dependent manner. The authors identified histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibitors (including vorinostat and romidepsin) that were able
to bypass SMN2 gene silencing by DNA methylation, while others (such as
valproic acid and phenylbutyrate) did not, due to HDAC isoenzyme
specificities. The authors concluded that DNA methylation is
functionally important regarding SMA disease progression, and
pharmacologic SMN2 gene activation might have implications for future
SMA therapy regimens.

- Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

Moulard et. al. (1998) found homozygous deletions of SMN2 in 36% of
individuals with sporadic adult-onset lower motor neuron disease (LMND),
but in only 6.2% of individuals with sporadic amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS; 105400) and 1.5% of individuals with familial ALS. The
authors argued that SMN2, but not SMN1, deletions are a susceptibility
factor for LMND, a disorder distinguishable from ALS by the absence of
upper motor neuron signs. LMND patients with SMN2 deletions differed
from those patients without such deletions by earlier age of onset (40
vs 56 years), more rapid disease progression (25 vs 36 months to death),
and a lower preponderance of males (M:F ratio of 1.5 vs 2.5).

Among 124 ALS patients, Gamez et al. (2002) found no association between
homozygous deletion of SMN2 and disease onset, respiratory decline, or
survival. A homozygous SMN2 deletion was identified in 11 (8.8%)
patients and 20 (10%) of 200 control individuals. Corcia et al. (2002)
found no difference in SMN2 gene copies among 167 ALS patients and 167
controls. Homozygous deletion of the SMN2 gene was found in 9 and 10% of
patients and controls, respectively. Among 600 patients with sporadic
ALS, Corcia et al. (2006) found no disease association with SMN2 copy
number.

Crawford and Skolasky (2002) briefly reviewed several reported
associations of SMN to ALS and concluded that the findings likely
represented nonsignificant or borderline significant fluctuations.
Corcia et al. (2002) responded that although they still supported a role
for the SMN2 gene in LMND (Moulard et al., 1998), the evidence of an
association between homozygous SMN2 deletion and ALS was less
convincing.

EVOLUTION

Rochette et al. (2001) used a number of approaches to probe the
evolutionary history of the SMN1 and SMN2 genes and showed that SMN gene
duplication and the appearance of SMN2 occurred at very distinct
evolutionary times. Molecular fossil and molecular clock data suggested
that this duplication may have occurred as recently as 3 million years
ago in that the position and repetitive elements are identical for both
human SMN genes and overall sequence divergence ranges from 0.15 to
0.34%. However, these approaches ignored the possibility of sequence
homogenization by means of gene conversion. Consequently, Rochette et
al. (2001) used quantitative polymerase chain reaction and analysis of
allelic variants to provide physical evidence for or against SMN gene
duplication in the chimpanzee, mankind's closest relative. These studies
revealed that chimpanzees have 2 to 7 copies of the SMN gene per diploid
genome; however, the 2 nucleotides diagnostic for exons 7-8 and the
SMNdel7 mRNA product of the SMN2 gene are absent in nonhuman primates.
In contrast, the SMN2 gene has been detected in all extant human
populations studied to date, including representatives from Europe, the
Central African Republic, and the Congo. These data provided conclusive
evidence that SMN gene duplication occurred more than 5 million years
ago, before the separation of human and chimpanzee lineages, but that
SMN2 appeared for the first time in Homo sapiens.

ANIMAL MODEL

Le et al. (2005) created transgenic mice expressing SMN2 lacking exon 7
(SMN-delta-7) and crossed them onto a severe SMA background. Expression
of SMN-delta-7 appeared to extend survival of SMA mice from 5 to 13
days. Unlike mice with selective deletion of SMN exon 7 in muscle, mice
with a small amount of full-length SMN (FL-SMN) did not show a
dystrophic phenotype. The authors suggested that low levels of FL-SMN
(as found in SMA patients) and absence of FL-SMN in muscle tissue may
have different effects, and raised the question of the importance of
high SMN levels in muscle in the presentation of SMA. SMN and
SMN-delta-7 can associate with each other; Le et al. (2005) suggested
that this association may stabilize SMN-delta-7 protein turnover and
ameliorate the SMA phenotype by increasing the amount of oligomeric SMN.

In SMA-like mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human SMN2-transfected motor
neuron cells, Ting et al. (2007) found that sodium vanadate,
trichostatin A, and aclarubicin effectively enhanced SMN2 expression by
inducing Stat5 (601511) activation. This resulted in enhanced SMN2
promoter activity with an increase in both full-length and deletion exon
7 SMN transcripts in human cells with SMN2. Knockdown of Stat5
expression disrupted the effects of sodium vanadate on SMN2 activation,
but did not influence SMN2 splicing, suggesting that Stat5 signaling is
involved in SMN2 transcriptional regulation. Constitutive expression of
the activated Stat5 mutant Stat5A1*6 profoundly increased the number of
nuclear gems in SMA patient lymphocytes and reduced SMA-like motor
neuron axon outgrowth defects.

Workman et al. (2009) showed that SMN(A111G), an allele capable of snRNP
assembly (A111G; 600354.0015), can rescue mice that lacked Smn and
contained either 1 or 2 copies of SMN2 (SMA mice). The correction of SMA
in these animals was directly correlated with snRNP assembly activity in
spinal cord, as was correction of snRNA levels. These data support snRNP
assembly as being the critical function affected in SMA and suggests
that the levels of snRNPs are critical to motor neurons. Furthermore,
SMN(A111G) could not rescue Smn-null mice without SMN2, suggesting that
both SMN(A111G) and SMN from SMN2 may undergo intragenic complementation
in vivo to function in heteromeric complexes that have greater function
than either allele alone. The oligomer composed of limiting full-length
SMN and SMN(A111G) had substantial snRNP assembly activity. The SMN(A2G)
(A2G; 600354.0002) and SMN(A111G) alleles in vivo did not complement
each other, leading to the possibility that these mutations could affect
the same function.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, MODIFIER OF
SMN2, GLY287ARG

In a 42-year-old woman with a mild form of SMA type III (253400),
despite a homozygous absence of SMN1 exon 7 (600354), Prior et al.
(2009) identified a homozygous 859G-C transversion in exon 7 of the SMN2
gene, resulting in a gly287-to-arg (G287R) substitution. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the change resulted in the
creation of an exonic splicing enhancer element and increased the amount
of full-length SMN2 transcripts compared to wildtype. The SMN1 genotype
(0 SMN1, 0 SNM2) predicted a more severe disorder (SMA1; 253300), but
the SMN2 variant increased SMN2 transcripts, resulting in a less severe
phenotype. The same 859G-C transversion was identified in heterozygosity
in 2 additional unrelated patients with mild forms of SMA, who were
predicted to have a more severe form of the disorder from their
genotypes (0 SMN1/1 SMN2 and 0 SMN1, 2 SMN2).

610346	TITLE *610346 CDC37-LIKE 1; CDC37L1
;;CELL DIVISION CYCLE 37, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG-LIKE 1; CDC37L1;;
HSP90-ASSOCIATING RELATIVE OF CDC37; HARC;;
FLJ20639
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CDC37L1 is a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein that exists in complex with
HSP90 (HSPCA; 140571) as well as several other proteins involved in
HSP90-mediated protein folding (Scholz et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases using CDC37 (605065) as a query, followed by
screening a signet ring cell gastric carcinoma cDNA library, Scholz et
al. (2001) cloned CDC37L1, which they named HARC. The deduced 337-amino
acid protein has a predicted molecular mass of 38.7 kD. HARC shares 31%
identity with CDC37 and 88% identity with mouse Harc. Northern blot
analysis detected high expression in human liver and skeletal muscle,
with lower levels in kidney, heart, brain, and placenta. By indirect
immunofluorescence and cell fractionation of kidney epithelial cells
transfected with HARC, Scholz et al. (2001) showed that HARC colocalized
to the cytosolic fraction with CDC37.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation experiments and analysis of HARC deletion
mutants, Scholz et al. (2001) showed that the central 120 amino acids of
HARC were required to bind HSP90. HARC and CDC37 binding to HSP90 were
mutually exclusive. HARC did not bind Src527F (SRC; 190090) or RAF1
(164760). By orthophosphate labeling and amino acid analysis, Scholz et
al. (2001) determined that HARC was serine phosphorylated by Src family
kinase Hck499F (HCK; 142370 ) and that both phosphorylated and
nonphosphorylated HARC forms associated with HSP90. By
coimmunoprecipitation, they showed that HARC also formed complexes with
HSP70 (HSPA1A; 140550), HOP (STIP1; 605063), an unidentified p22
protein, and immunophilins FKBP52 (FKBP4; 600611) and CYP40 (PPID;
601753); however, HARC did not associate with HSP90 cochaperone P23
(PTGES3; 607061).

GENE STRUCTURE

Scholz et al. (2001) determined that the CDC37L1 gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By database sequence analysis, Scholz et al. (2001) mapped the CDC37L1
gene to chromosome 9p24.1.

;;CLATHRIN ADAPTOR COMPLEX AP3, MU-3B SUBUNIT;;
CLA20
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Pevsner et al. (1994) cloned rat Ap3m2, which encodes a 47-kD protein
with about 80% amino acid identity to rat Ap3m1 (610366) and about 30%
amino acid identity to mouse mu-1 (see AP1M1; 603535) and rat mu-2
(AP2M1; 601024). Ap3m2 was expressed exclusively in rat brain and spinal
cord.

By amplifying exons from cosmid clones mapped to chromosome 8, followed
by screening a human fetal brain cDNA library, Koyama et al. (1995)
cloned AP3M2, which they designated CLA20. AP3M2 encodes a deduced
protein of 418 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous
expression of a major 3.5-kb transcript and low expression of a minor
1.7-kb transcript in liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas.

MAPPING

Koyama et al. (1995) localized the AP3M2 gene to a cosmid clone that had
previously been mapped by FISH to chromosome 8p11.2.

608753	TITLE *608753 tRNA SPLICING ENDONUCLEASE 2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; TSEN2
;;SEN2, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; SEN2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

tRNA splicing is a fundamental process required for cell growth and
division. SEN2 is a subunit of the tRNA splicing endonuclease, which
catalyzes the removal of introns, the first step in tRNA splicing
(Paushkin et al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching sequence databases using yeast Sen2 as probe, followed by
PCR of human cDNA libraries, Paushkin et al. (2004) isolated a
full-length SEN2 cDNA and a splice variant lacking exon 8. Full-length
SEN2 contains 465 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 51
kD. It shares a high degree of similarity with yeast Sen2 only in the
active site domain. The SEN2 variant lacking exon 8 contains 448 amino
acids. Northern blot analysis detected low expression of both SEN2
transcripts in all tissues examined. Immunofluorescence microscopy of
transfected HeLa cells localized both SEN2 isoforms to the nucleus. The
variant lacking exon 8 was frequently found in nucleoli in dot-like
structures.

GENE FUNCTION

Paushkin et al. (2004) identified and characterized the human tRNA
splicing endonuclease. This enzyme consists of SEN2, SEN34 (608754),
SEN15 (608756), and SEN54 (608755), homologs of the yeast tRNA
endonuclease subunits. Additionally, the SEN2 variant lacking exon 8 is
part of a complex with unique RNA endonuclease activity. Paushkin et al.
(2004) found that both human endonuclease complexes are associated with
pre-mRNA 3-prime end processing factors, including CLP1 (608757). Small
interfering RNA-mediated depletion of SEN2 led to defects in maturation
of both pre-tRNA and pre-mRNA. These findings demonstrated a link
between pre-tRNA splicing and pre-mRNA 3-prime end formation, suggesting
that the endonuclease subunits function in multiple RNA processing
events.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TSEN2
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP RH103927).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Budde et al. (2008) identified a homozygous missense mutation in a
patient of consanguineous Pakistani descent, resulting in
pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2 (277470).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PONTOCEREBELLAR HYPOPLASIA, TYPE 2B
TSEN2, TYR309CYS

In a Pakistani male, the product of a consanguineous union, with
pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2 (PCH2B; 612389) in whom no mutations
in TSEN54 (608755) were identified, Budde et al. (2008) identified a
homozygous A-to-G transition at nucleotide 926 of the TSEN2 gene,
resulting in a tyrosine-to-cysteine substitution at codon 309 (Y309C).
Each parent was heterozygous for the mutation, which was not identified
in 188 healthy Pakistani controls nor in 92 Dutch, 45 Chinese, or 28
Palestinian controls. The tyrosine at position 309 is strictly conserved
(tyrosine or phenylalanine) within eukaryotic organisms.

603632	TITLE *603632 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S10; RPS10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The mammalian ribosome is a macromolecular assembly of 4 RNA species
(see 180450) and approximately 80 different proteins (see 180466).

CLONING

Adams et al. (1992) isolated an RPS10 cDNA as a human brain EST.

By searching sequence databases with the partial sequences of randomly
selected cDNAs from a human colorectal cDNA library, Frigerio et al.
(1995) identified cDNAs encoding homologs of rat ribosomal proteins S5
(RPS5; 603630), S9 (RPS9; 603631), S10 (RPS10), S29 (RPS29; 603633), L5
(RPL5; 603634), L21 (RPL21; 603636), L27a (RPL27A; 603637), and L28
(RPL28; 603638). Frigerio et al. (1995) completed the cDNA sequences of
these human ribosomal proteins. The deduced 165-amino acid human RPS10
differs from rat Rps10 by 2 amino acids; neither protein contains
cysteine residues. Northern blot analysis suggested variable expression
of RPS10 in colorectal cancers compared to adjacent normal tissues,
although no correlation between the level of expression and the severity
of the disease was found.

GENE STRUCTURE

Boria et al. (2010) stated that the RPS10 gene contains 6 exons spanning
8.65 kb.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid mapping analyses, Kenmochi
et al. (1998) mapped the human RPS10 gene to chromosome 6p.

Boria et al. (2010) stated that the RPS10 gene maps to chromosome
6p21.31.

GENE FUNCTION

Using siRNA knockdown in HeLa cells to analyze the role of RPS10 in
pre-rRNA processing, Doherty et al. (2010) found that depletion of RPS10
led to decreased levels of 18S rRNA, indicating that RPS10 is necessary
for production of the small subunit. RNA blot analysis showed
accumulation of 43S, 26S, and 18S-E pre-rRNAs, consistent with defects
in cleavage at both ends of the 18S rRNA.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Doherty et al. (2010) sequenced 35 ribosomal protein genes in a cohort
of 117 patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (see DBA9, 613308) who were
negative for mutation in 7 known DBA genes and identified 3 mutations in
the RPS10 gene (603632.0001-603632.0003) in 5 patients.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DIAMOND-BLACKFAN ANEMIA 9
RPS10, MET1ILE

In a male patient with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (613308), Doherty et al.
(2010) identified heterozygosity for a 3G-A transition in exon 1 of the
RPS10 gene, causing a met1-to-thr (M1T) substitution that eliminates the
start codon and is predicted to result in a truncated 144-residue
protein. The mutation was not found in at least 520 control chromosomes.

.0002
DIAMOND-BLACKFAN ANEMIA 9
RPS10, 1-BP INS, 260C

In a female patient who was diagnosed with Diamond-Blackfan anemia
(613308) at 2 months of age, Doherty et al. (2010) identified
heterozygosity for a 1-bp insertion (260insC) in exon 3 of the RPS10
gene, resulting in a frameshift and a premature termination codon. The
mutation was not found in her unaffected father or in at least 520
control chromosomes.

.0003
DIAMOND-BLACKFAN ANEMIA 9
RPS10, ARG113TER

In a male and 2 female probands with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (613308),
Doherty et al. (2010) identified heterozygosity for a 337C-T transition
in exon 4 of the RPS10 gene, resulting in an arg113-to-ter (R113X)
substitution. Two of the patients were responsive to steroid therapy;
the third, a female with a de novo mutation who was diagnosed at birth,
was unresponsive to steroid therapy and was also noted to have a webbed
neck. The mutation was not found in at least 520 control chromosomes.

;;MIXED-LINEAGE KINASE 2; MLK2;;
MKN28 KINASE;;
SERINE/THREONINE KINASE, MKN28-DERIVED, NONRECEPTOR-TYPE; MST
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Katoh et al. (1995) described the putative serine/threonine kinase
MAP3K10, which they isolated as a cDNA fragment from an MKN28 gastric
cancer cell library using degenerate PCR. Additional cDNAs of the gene,
which they called MST (MKN28-derived nonreceptor type of
serine/threonine kinase), were isolated from a brain library. MST
encodes a predicted 953-amino acid protein with a Src homology (SH3)
domain, 2 leucine zipper domains, and a proline-rich domain. Northern
blot analysis showed that the gene is moderately expressed in brain,
skeletal muscle, and testis as a 3.8-kb mRNA.

By screening a human colonic cDNA library, Dorow et al. (1993)
identified a partial clone representing MAP3K10, which they called MLK2.
With the exception of a short C-terminal peptide, the MLK2 clone shares
75% predicted amino acid identity with MLK1 (600136). The 2 sequences
are also identical with respect to the distinctive features and spatial
arrangement of the catalytic domain motifs. Dorow et al. (1995) isolated
a full-length MAP3K10 cDNA from a brain cDNA library. The deduced
954-amino acid protein contains an SH3 domain, a kinase catalytic
domain, a double leucine zipper and basic domain, and a large C-terminal
domain. Northern blot analysis detected a single 3.8-kb transcript with
highest expression in brain and skeletal muscle, and lower expression in
pancreas.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Katoh et al. (1995) mapped the MAP3K10 gene to
19q13.1-q13.2. By FISH, Dorow et al. (1995) localized the gene to
19q13.2.
