614958	TITLE *614958 SCHLAFEN FAMILY, MEMBER 14; SLFN14
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Schlafen (SFLN) family contains 9 mouse and 6 human genes, including
SLFN14, that encode proteins with a conserved N terminus containing a
putative AAA ATPase domain. Longer SLFN proteins have C-terminal motifs
resembling DNA/RNA helicase domains. Studies in mouse have implicated
SLFN proteins in regulation of cell growth and T-cell development
(summary by Geserick et al. (2004) and Li et al. (2012)).

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the SLFN14 gene to chromosome 17q12 based on an
alignment of the SLFN14 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC140847) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Bustos et al. (2009) found that the SLFN genes are clustered within the
same orthologous region flanked by the UNC45 (UNC45B; 611220) and PEX12
(601758) genes in all mammalian genomes examined. The human and mouse
SLFN clusters are located on chromosomes 17 and 11, respectively.

EVOLUTION

Bustos et al. (2009) used genomic and phylogenetic studies to
investigate the evolution and role of the SLFN gene family. They found
that the SLFN family is widely distributed in mammals, with 4 major
clades that underwent lineage-specific expansions or contractions in
various orders, including primates and rodents. Bustos et al. (2009)
also identified SLFN family members in Chondrichthyes and Amphibia. They
found evidence that positive selection has acted on many SLFN genes. A
member of the SLFN family was horizontally transferred from mouse to
orthopoxviruses, where the authors hypothesized it plays a role in
allowing the virus to survive host defense mechanisms. The viral SLFN
sequences are evolving under purifying selection, indicating their
functional relevance.

Van Zuylen et al. (2011) noted that only 2 SLFN family members, SLFN5
(614952) and SLFN14, have direct orthologs in mouse and human,
consistent with rapid evolution of the SLFN family across mammalian
species. Human SLFN12 (614956) and SLFN12L (614957) have 4 orthologs in
mice (Slfn1, Slfn2, Slfn3, and Slfn4), and human SLFN11 (614953) and
SLFN13 (614957) have 3 orthologs in mice (Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10).

610396	TITLE *610396 TRAFFICKING PROTEIN PARTICLE COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 6A; TRAPPC6A
;;TRAPP COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 6A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRAPPC6A is a subunit of the TRAPPI and TRAPPII complexes (Gwynn et al.,
2006).

CLONING

Gwynn et al. (2006) cloned mouse Trappc6a, and they identified human
TRAPPC6A by database analysis. Mouse and human TRAPPC6A encode deduced
159-amino acid proteins that share 83% identity and have calculated
molecular masses of 17.4 kD. Both proteins contain 2 motifs conserved in
TRAPPC6B (610397) and several yeast TRAPP subunits, including Trs33, the
putative homolog of TRAPPC6A and TRAPPC6B. Northern blot analysis
detected Trappc6a expression in all mouse tissues examined, with highest
expression in kidney, liver, and testis. Expression of mouse Trappc6a
was higher in cultured melanocytes than in kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gwynn et al. (2006) determined that the mouse Trappc6a gene contains 6
exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
TRAPPC6A gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP RH98840). Gwynn et al. (2006)
mapped the mouse Trappc6a gene to chromosome 7.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gwynn et al. (2006) identified a recessive mutation in mice, designated
'mosaic hypopigmentation' (Mhyp), that caused mosaic loss of coat
pigmentation and patchy loss of pigmentation with abnormal melanosomes
in the retinal pigmented epithelial layer of the eye. They determined
that Mhyp resulted from integration of an 8.4-kb retrovirus into intron
1 of the Trappc6a gene.

;;ATF7-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2;;
MBD1-CONTAINING CHROMATIN-ASSOCIATED FACTOR 2; MCAF2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to the 2 conserved C-terminal domains
of MCAF1 (ATF7IP1; 613644), followed by PCR, Ichimura et al. (2005)
cloned ATF7IP2, which they called MCAF2. The deduced full-length protein
contains 681 amino acids. Conserved domains 1 and 2 of MCAF1 and MCAF2
share 27% and 56% amino acid identity, respectively. Database analysis
revealed that domain 2 shows highest conservation between species.
Western blot analysis of several human cell lines detected variable
ATF71IP2 expression at an apparent molecular mass of 100 kD.
Fluorescence-tagged MCAF1 and MCAF2 colocalized with MBD1 (156535) at
nuclear foci.

GENE FUNCTION

Ichimura et al. (2005) showed that both MCAF1 and MCAF2 bound to the
C-terminal transcriptional repression domain (TRD) of MBD1. Removal of
domain 2 of MCAF1 or MCAF2 abolished the interactions with MBD1 in vitro
and abolished colocalization of these proteins with MBD1 at nuclear foci
in cultured human cells. MCAF1 and MCAF2 also bound the transcriptional
regulators SETDB1 (604396) and SP1 (189906). Immunoprecipitation
analysis of K562 human erythroleukemia cells revealed that MCAF1 showed
higher affinity for SETDB1 than SP1, whereas MCAF2 showed higher
affinity for SP1 than SETDB1. Both MCAF proteins were also detected in
the same immunoprecipitates. Both MCAF1 and MCAF2 increased
transcription of a reporter gene activated by SP1, and the TRD of MBD1
moderately repressed transcription in the presence of either MCAF1 or
MCAF2. The combination of MCAF1, the TRD of MBD1, and SETDB1 caused
marked transcriptional repression in a SETDB1-dependent manner. In
contrast, SETDB1 had no effect on promoter activity in the presence of
MCAF2 and the TRD of MBD1. Knockdown of MCAF1 in HeLa cells abolished
repression by the TRD of MBD1, and exogenous expression of MCAF2 partly
compensated for MCAF1 knockdown.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the ATF7IP2 gene to chromosome 16p13.13 based on an
alignment of the ATF7IP2 gene (GenBank GENBANK AK022730) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;APOLIPOPROTEIN B mRNA-EDITING ENZYME, CATALYTIC POLYPEPTIDE 1-BINDING
PROTEIN 1;;
APOBEC1-BINDING PROTEIN 1; ABBP1;;
HNRPAB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Apolipoprotein B (APOB; 107730) mRNA editing is an intranuclear function
and is mediated by a multiprotein editosome complex (see APOBEC1;
600130). Using the yeast 2-hybrid system, Lau et al. (1997) identified
an APOBEC1-binding protein (ABBP1) that interacts with APOB mRNA. The
ABBP1 cDNA encodes a 331-amino acid protein that is identical to the
human type A/B heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) reported
by Khan et al. (1991), except for a 47-residue insertion in its
C-terminal region. Khan et al. (1991) identified the type A/B hnRNP as
an RNA-binding protein of unknown function in HeLa cells. Northern blot
analysis indicated that ABBP1 mRNA is distributed in multiple human
tissues as an approximately 2-kb transcript. The 47-amino acid insertion
of ABBP1 is encoded by an alternatively spliced exon.

GENE FUNCTION

Lau et al. (1997) found that ABBP1 contains typical RNP-type RNA-binding
motifs in its N-terminal half and glycine-rich motifs, which house the
APOBEC1-binding region, in its C-terminal region. ABBP1 binds to APOB
mRNA transcripts around the editing site and can be UV-crosslinked to
them. Editing is inhibited by ABBP1 immunodepletion or antisense ABBP1
cDNA transfection.

612610	TITLE *612610 LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE PROTEIN 2B; LCE2B
;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 10; LEP10;;
XP5
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

Using a selection cloning method to identify genes within the epidermal
differentiation complex (EDC) on chromosome 1, Zhao and Elder (1997)
identified LCE2B, which they called XP5. The deduced protein contains
110 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected XP5 expression in
normal and psoriatic skin, but not in other tissues and cell lines
examined, including normal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts.

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE2B,
which they called LEP10. RT-PCR detected high LEP10 expression in skin.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) detected LCE2B expression in
human fetal, arm, penal, and abdominal skin. Little to no expression was
detected in vulva, tongue, and esophagus.

GENE FUNCTION

Jackson et al. (2005) showed that expression of LCE2 genes, including
LCE2B, was upregulated in cultured normal human keratinocytes by both
ultraviolet irradiation and calcium.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that the LCE2B gene contains 2 exons.
Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Zhao and Elder (1997) mapped the LCE2B gene to chromosome
1q21. By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the
LCE2B gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et
al. (2005) stated that the mouse Lce2b gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene
cluster on chromosome 3F1.

606100	TITLE *606100 EGF-LIKE MODULE-CONTAINING, MUCIN-LIKE HORMONE RECEPTOR 2; EMR2
DESCRIPTION Epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530)-7-transmembrane (TM7) proteins are
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) found on monocytes and neutrophils.
They include mouse F4/80, mouse and human CD97 (601211), and EMR1
(600493), the likely human homolog of F4/80. EGF-TM7 glycoproteins have
variable numbers of N-terminal EGF-like repeats coupled to a family-B
GPCR-related moiety via a mucin-like stalk.

CLONING

By EST database searching, 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, and cDNA library
screening, Lin et al. (2000) obtained cDNAs encoding EMR2 and multiple
splice variants. Sequence analysis predicted that the 823-amino acid
EMR2 protein has an N-terminal signal peptide, 5 EGF-like domains, which
are nearly identical to those of CD97, and multiple N- and
O-glycosylation sites. EGF domains 2 through 5 have calcium-binding
sequences likely to play important roles in protein-protein
interactions. The spacer domain, which contains a cysteine-rich motif
involved in proteolytic cleavage, and the 248-residue 7-transmembrane
domain are each approximately 46% identical to those of CD97. The
41-amino acid cytoplasmic tail has 4 potential phosphorylation sites.
Northern blot analysis revealed expression of 3.3- and 6.1-kb EMR2
transcripts. Highest expression was found in peripheral blood
leukocytes, followed by spleen and lymph nodes, with intermediate to low
levels in thymus, bone marrow, fetal liver, placenta, and lung, and no
expression in heart, brain, skeletal muscle, kidney, or pancreas. RT-PCR
analysis detected EMR2 expression in monocyte/macrophage and Jurkat cell
lines but not in other cell lines tested, indicating expression of EMR2
is less broad than that observed for CD97. Flow cytometric analysis
demonstrated cross-reactivity with EGF domain-reactive anti-CD97
antibodies and specific reactivity with antibodies against spacer
sequences. Binding analysis, however, showed that EMR2 does not interact
with the CD97 ligand, CD55 (125240), suggesting that the association
between CD97 and CD55 is highly dependent on 3 or fewer amino acids
and/or the more diverse spacer region.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Lin et al. (2000) determined that the EMR2
gene contains 20 exons and spans 45 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lin et al. (2000) localized the EMR2 gene
between the NOTCH3 (600276) and RFX1 (600006) genes on 19p13.1, close to
the other EGF-TM7 genes.

;;MAPKAP3;;
MAPKAP KINASE 3;;
3PK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Sithanandam et al. (1996) identified a mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK)-activated protein kinase with a single potential SH3-binding site
in the proline-rich N terminus, a putative ATP-binding site, 2 MAP
kinase phosphorylation site motifs, and a putative nuclear localization
signal. They called the protein 3pK. The gene was cloned from NotI
linking clones and codes for a 2.5-kd mRNA that was expressed in all
human tissues examined, being especially high in the heart and skeletal
muscle. Sequence analysis revealed a 382-amino acid protein of 42 kD. It
shares 72% nucleotide and 75% amino acid identity with MAPKAP kinase-2
(602006). In HL60 cells and transiently transfected HEK293 cells,
activation of 3pK in vivo by the growth inducers serum and tetradecanoyl
phorbol acetate was Raf dependent and was mediated by the Raf/MEK/ERK
kinase cascade.

GENE FUNCTION

Ludwig et al. (1996) showed that 3pK is the first kinase to be activated
through all 3 MAPK cascades: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK;
see 176948), MAPKAP kinase-2, and Jun-N-terminal
kinases/stress-activated protein kinases. They showed also that 3pK has
a novel substrate specificity from other MAPKAPs. Thus, Ludwig et al.
(1996) concluded that 3pK functions as an integrative element of
signaling in both mitogen and stress responses.

Maizels et al. (2001) investigated the activation in vivo and regulation
of the expression of components of the p38 MAPK (600289) pathway during
gonadotropin-induced formation and development of the rat corpus luteum.
They postulated that the p38 MAPK pathway could serve to promote
phosphorylation of key substrates during luteal maturation, since
maturing luteal cells, thought to be cAMP-nonresponsive, nevertheless
maintain critical phosphoproteins. The p38 MAPK downstream protein
kinase target MAPKAPK3 was newly induced at both mRNA and protein levels
during luteal formation and maturation, while mRNA and protein
expression of the closely related MAPKAPK2 diminished. MAPKAPK3-specific
immune complex kinase assays provided direct evidence that MAPKAPK3 was
in an activated state during luteal maturation in vivo. Transient
transfection studies provided direct evidence that MAPKAPK3 was capable
of signaling to activate CREB (123810) transcriptional activity, as
assessed by means of GAL4-CREB fusion protein construct coexpressed with
GAL4-luciferase reporter construct. Introduction of wildtype, but not
kinase-dead mutant, MAPKAPK3 cDNA, into a mouse ovarian cell line
stimulated GAL4-CREB-dependent transcriptional activity approximately
3-fold. Maizels et al. (2001) concluded that MAPKAPK3 is uniquely poised
to support luteal maturation through the phosphorylation and activation
of the nuclear transcription factor CREB.

GENE STRUCTURE

Maizels et al. (2001) determined that the MAPKAPK3 gene contains 10
exons.

MAPPING

Maizels et al. (2001) mapped the MAPKAPK3 gene to chromosome 3p21.3.

148065	TITLE *148065 KERATIN 13; KRT13
;;K13;;
CYTOKERATIN 13
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) are assembled from heterodimeric
subunits comprised of a type I and a type II protein. Keratin-13 (KRT13)
is a member of the type I (acidic) subfamily of genes characteristic of
the internal stratified epithelia (Romano et al., 1991).

MAPPING

By PCR amplification with cytokeratin 13-specific DNA antimers of a
human-hamster somatic cell hybrid DNA panel, Romano et al. (1991) mapped
the KRT13 gene to chromosome 17. By means of in situ hybridization, they
determined the subchromosomal localization to be 17q12-q22. They further
analyzed this region by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and
demonstrated that the KRT13 gene is in the same large DNA fragment as
the KRT10 (148080) and KRT15 (148030) genes. Further experiments
performed with conventional agarose gel electrophoresis showed that the
KRT10 and KRT13 genes are located in the same 14-kb fragment. A
correlation of assignments of the 3 genes makes 17q21-q22 the likely
location of the cluster. Romano et al. (1992) gave the location as
17q12-q21.2.

Ceratto et al. (1997) isolated and analyzed a YAC clone that mapped to
17q12-q21 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. By Southern analysis
and pulsed field gel electrophoresis they concluded that KRT13, KRT14
(148066), KRT15, KRT16, and the linked type I genes KRT17 (148069) and
KRT19 (148020), are contained in less than 150 kb of genomic DNA.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a multigenerational Italian family segregating
white sponge nevus (193900), Richard et al. (1995) identified
heterozygosity for a missense mutation in the KRT13 gene (148065.0001).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
WHITE SPONGE NEVUS
KRT13, LEU15PRO

In a multigeneration Italian family with white sponge nevus (193900),
Richard et al. (1995) demonstrated a T-to-C transition changing codon 15
of the KRT13 gene from CTG (leu) to CCG (pro) (L15P). The mutation was
in the 1A subdomain of keratin 13. Substitution of C for T created a
unique MspI recognition site that resulted in cleavage of amplified DNA
on MspI digestion. Richard et al. (1995) mutations in the precise
corresponding residue have been described in keratin-9 (L15S;
607606.0008) in epidermolytic palmoplantar hyperkeratosis by Rothnagel
et al. (1995), in keratin 10 (L15S; 148080.0002) in epidermolytic
hyperkeratosis, and of keratin 16 (L15P; 148067.0001) in pachyonychia
congenita.

Richard et al. (1995) numbered this mutation starting with the first
residue in the 1A domain of KRT13. This mutation is also known as
LEU119PRO.

180530	TITLE *180530 RIBOSOMAL PHOSPHOPROTEIN, LARGE, P2; RPLP2
;;RIBOSOMAL PHOSPHOPROTEIN, ACIDIC, P2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Acidic ribosomal proteins, called A-proteins or P-proteins, are
generally present in multiple copies on the ribosome and have
isoelectric points in the range of pH 3 to 5, in contrast to most
ribosomal proteins, which are single copy and basic. A-proteins have
hydrophobic amino acid compositions, notably about 20% alanine.

CLONING

Rich and Steitz (1987) described the isolation and analysis of 3 cDNA
molecules that encode the human P-proteins, P2, P1 (180520), and P0
(180510). The human P1 and P2 cDNA nucleotide sequences and deduced
amino acid sequences of the proteins are very similar to the sequences
that have been determined for the corresponding rat, shrimp, and yeast
proteins and cDNAs. P0 sequences had not previously been described. To
demonstrate that the coding sequences are full length, Rich and Steitz
(1987) transcribed the P0, P1, and P2 cDNAs in vitro. The P0, P1, and P2
proteins produced were serologically and electrophoretically identical
to P-proteins extracted from HeLa cells. The deduced P2 protein contains
115 amino acids. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 0.60-kb
transcript in HeLa cells.

608951	TITLE *608951 CCR4-NOT TRANSCRIPTION COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 6; CNOT6
;;CCR4, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; CCR4;;
KIAA1194
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned CNOT6, which they called KIAA1194.
The deduced protein contains 575 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected
variable expression in all fetal and adult tissues and specific brain
regions examined. Highest expression was in adult brain, testis, ovary,
spinal cord, and caudate nucleus, and lowest expression was in pancreas
and spleen. Expression in fetal brain was lower than that in adult
brain.

Chen et al. (2002) identified CNOT6 as 1 of 2 human homologs of the S.
cerevisiae Ccr4 protein, which is part of a general transcriptional
regulatory complex involved in several aspects of mRNA metabolism,
including transcription initiation and elongation and mRNA degradation.
They determined that the C-terminal half of CNOT6, which they called
CCR4, contains 5 highly conserved motifs critical for
apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease activity. See 608468 for information
on the other human Ccr4 homolog, CCRN4L.

GENE FUNCTION

Chen et al. (2002) characterized human CNOT6 following expression in a
yeast strain lacking the endogenous yeast Ccr4 gene. CNOT6 showed
poly(A) exonuclease activity against a substrate containing five 3-prime
adenines. CNOT6 also interacted with mouse or human CAF1 (604913)
following coexpression in yeast.

Chang et al. (2004) presented evidence that CNOT6 functions as a poly(A)
nuclease involved in mRNA decay mediated by the major-protein-coding
determinant of instability (mCRD) of the FOS gene (164810). They found
that CNOT6 associated with UNR (191510) in the mCRD complex.

Garapaty et al. (2008) determined that CNOT6 augments the
ligand-dependent transcriptional activation of a wide variety of nuclear
receptors, including RARA (180240), THRA (190120), RXRA (180245), ESR1
(133430), and GCCR (138040), through an NIF1 (610827) coactivator
complex. siRNA-mediated silencing of endogenous CNOT6 resulted in a
marked decrease in nuclear receptor activation as well as attenuated
stimulation of RARA target genes, including SOX9 (608160) and HOXA1
(142955). siRNA knockdown of NIF1, with which CNOT6 associates in vivo,
blocked the ligand-dependent potentiating effect of CNOT6.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CNOT6
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP SHGC-32852).

604028	TITLE *604028 SECRETION DEFICIENT 22, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, C; SEC22C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

SNAP (see 603215) receptors, or SNAREs, determine the specificity of the
docking and fusion of vesicles to the correct target membranes. The S.
cerevisiae Sec22, Bet1 (605456), and Bos1 SNAREs are interacting
proteins that play a role in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi transport.
See GOSR2 (604027). By searching EST databases for sequences related to
rat SEC22A (612442), Tang et al. (1998) identified human cDNAs encoding
a protein that they designated SEC22C. Northern blot analysis revealed
that SEC22C is expressed ubiquitously as 1- and 5-kb mRNAs. The
predicted 250-amino acid SEC22C protein shares 36% and 19% sequence
identity with rat SEC22A and mouse Sec22b (604029), respectively. By
immunofluorescence of mammalian cells expressing epitope-tagged SEC22C,
Tang et al. (1998) found that SEC22C accumulated primarily at the ER. As
with Sec22b, overexpression of recombinant SEC22C protein disrupted the
localization of SNAREs involved in ER-Golgi transport, indicating that
SEC22C protein plays a role in ER-Golgi protein trafficking.

GENE FUNCTION

To fuse transport vesicles with target membranes, proteins of the SNARE
complex must be located on both the vesicle and the target membrane. In
yeast, 4 integral membrane proteins, Sed5, Bos1, Sec22, and Bet1 each
are believed to contribute a single helix to form the SNARE complex that
is needed for transport from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi. This
generates a 4-helix bundle, which ultimately mediates the actual fusion
event. Parlati et al. (2000) explored how the anchoring arrangement of
the 4 helices affects their ability to mediate fusion. Parlati et al.
(2000) reconstituted 2 populations of phospholipid bilayer vesicles,
with the individual SNARE proteins distributed in all possible
combinations between them. Of the 8 nonredundant permutations of 4
subunits distributed over 2 vesicle populations, only 1 resulted in
membrane fusion. Fusion occurred only when the v-SNARE Bet1 is on 1
membrane and the syntaxin heavy chain Sed5 and its 2 light chains, Bos1
and Sec22, are on the other membrane, where they form a functional
t-SNARE. Thus, each SNARE protein is topologically restricted by design
to function either as a v-SNARE or as part of a t-SNARE complex.

601929	TITLE *601929 ATPase, Ca(2+)-TRANSPORTING, UBIQUITOUS; ATP2A3
;;SARCOPLASMIC RETICULUM Ca(2+)-ATPase 3; SERCA3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases (SERCAs), such as ATP2A3, are
membrane-spanning proteins that transport Ca(2+) across membranes
bordering Ca(2+)-sequestering stores, such as the sarcoplasmic or
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Isoform diversity results by alternative
processing of the primary gene transcripts in a developmentally
modulated or tissue-specific manner.

CLONING

Dode et al. (1996) isolated cDNA and genomic clones of human SERCA3. The
deduced 109,237-Da protein contains 999 amino acids and is 94% similar
to rat SERCA3. Northern blot analysis provided evidence for alternative
processing of the SERCA3 transcript.

By RT-PCR, Santiago-Garcia et al. (1996) found variable expression of
the PMCA (see 108731) and SERCA genes during human fetal heart
development. SERCA3 was expressed at relatively constant levels at all
stages of fetal heart development examined and in adult heart and
placenta.

Poch et al. (1998) cloned 2 SERCA3 splice variants from a kidney cDNA
library and a Jurkat T-cell line cDNA library. The deduced proteins,
which contain 999 and 1,029 amino acids, both have 10 transmembrane
domains but differ at their C termini. They also cloned a third variant
encoding a 998-amino acid protein that differs from the 999-amino acid
protein at 3 amino acids; however, the origin of this variant was
unclear. Northern blot analysis detected a major transcript of about 5
kb expressed at highest levels in thymus, colon, pancreas, and spleen.
Intermediate to low expression was detected in all other tissues
examined. The SERCA3 proteins localized in the nuclear envelope and in
the ER throughout human embryonic kidney and Jurkat T-cell lines.

Dode et al. (1998) identified 3 SERCA3 splice variants that encode
proteins with 999, 1,043, and 1,024 amino acids. The proteins, which the
authors designated SERCA3a, SERCA3b, and SERCA3c, respectively, differ
only in their C termini. Mouse Serca3 is also expressed as 3 variants of
similar size.

By RT-PCR of human platelets, Martin et al. (2002) identified and cloned
2 additional SERCA3 splice variants, which they designated SERCA3d and
SERCA3e. The deduced proteins contain 1,044 and 1,052 amino acids,
respectively, and differ from each other and the previously identified
SERCA3 isoforms only in their C termini. RT-PCR detected all 5 SERCA3
splice variants in platelets, lung, and pancreas. Heart, brain,
placenta, and kidney expressed 3 or 4 splice variants, and skeletal
muscle expressed only 1 variant. Variation was also found in the
expression of SERCA3 variants in established cell lines.

Bobe et al. (2004) identified a sixth SERCA3 variant, which they
designated SERCA3f, that lacks exon 21 but retains exon 22. The deduced
SERCA3f protein contains 1,033-amino acids and differs from the other
SERCA3 isoforms at the C terminus. RT-PCR detected SERCA3f expression in
all tissues and cell lines examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Following isolation of the microsome fraction of transfected human
embryonic kidney cells, Poch et al. (1998) demonstrated that proteins
encoded by 2 SERCA3 splice variants supported Ca(2+) uptake and ATPase
activity.

Martin et al. (2002) found that all 5 SERCA3 isoforms pumped Ca(2+) with
similar affinities, and all pumped Ca(2+) toward the ER. However, the
isoforms modulated cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations and ER Ca(2+)
concentrations differently. Martin et al. (2002) concluded that the
SERCA3 isoforms have widespread roles in cellular Ca(2+) signaling.

Gelebart et al. (2002) found that expression of SERCA3 was significantly
reduced or lost in colon carcinomas compared with normal colonic
epithelial cells. Treatment of tumor cells with butyrate or other
differentiation inducers resulted in increased SERCA3 expression,
whereas SERCA2 (ATP2A2; 108740) expression was unaltered or was reduced.
SERCA3 expression was increased along with other differentiation markers
during spontaneous post-confluence differentiation of a colon carcinoma
cell line.

Because the SERCA3b and SERCA3f isoforms diverge at the beginning of the
C-terminal domain but share the same last 21 amino acids, Bobe et al.
(2004) investigated the relationship between structure, function, and
location of these isoforms. Immunofluorescence and/or confocal
microscopy showed that SERCA3f and SERCA3b localized in overlapping but
distinct ER locations. By transfection in human embryonic kidney cells,
Bobe et al. (2004) found that SERCA3b and SERCA3f created distinct
resting cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations and ER Ca(2+) content. SERCA3b
and SERCA3f showed similar sensitivity to a SERCA inhibitor and similar
kinetics of Ca(2+) release and reuptake. They both demonstrated low
apparent Ca(2+) affinity and enhanced rates of dephosphorylation of the
phosphoenzyme intermediate relative to other SERCA Ca(2+) channels.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dode et al. (1998) determined that the ATP2A3 gene contains 22 exons and
spans more than 50 kb. Exon 21 is subject to alternative splicing and
may be included, partially included, or excluded. The promoter region
has no TATA box, but it has 14 putative Sp1 (189906) sites, 11 CACCC
boxes, 5 AP2 (107580)-binding motifs, 3 GGCTGGGG motifs, 3 CANNTG boxes,
a GATA (see 305371) site, and single sites for ETS1 (164720), MYC
(190080), and TFIIIC (see 603246). The authors showed that the GC-rich
region was critical for SERCA3 transcription in Jurkat cells.

Martin et al. (2002) identified a novel exon within what was previously
reported as the last intron of ATP2A3, indicating that the ATP2A3 gene
contains 23 exons.

MAPPING

Dode et al. (1996) assigned the ATP2A3 gene to human chromosome 17p13.3
by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

ANIMAL MODEL

Liu et al. (1997) found that Serca3-null mice were viable, fertile, and
did not exhibit an overt disease phenotype. However, mutant aortic ring
preparations showed diminished acetylcholine-induced intracellular
Ca(2+) signaling and relaxation, with reduced Ca(2+) transient and
nitric oxide production. Their response to other modifiers of vascular
tone was unaltered. Liu et al. (1997) concluded that SERCA3 plays a role
in Ca(2+) signaling mechanisms that mediate endothelium-dependent
relaxation of vascular smooth muscle.

Serca3 expression is restricted to beta cells in mouse pancreas.
Arredouani et al. (2002) found the Serca3 ablation was insufficient in
itself to alter glucose homeostasis or impair insulin secretion in mice.
However, Serca3 ablation altered the reuptake of Ca(2+) into the ER and
increased the insulin response of islets to glucose.

;;TBP1-INTERACTING PROTEIN; TBPIP;;
GT198;;
HOP2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; HOP2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PSMC3IP gene encodes a nuclear, tissue-specific protein with
multiple functions, including a role in meiotic recombination and as a
coactivator of ligand-dependent transcription mediated by nuclear
hormone receptors (summary by Zangen et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing putative genes centromeric to the BRCA1 gene (113705) on
chromosome 17, followed by screening a breast cancer cell line cDNA
library, Rommens et al. (1995) cloned GT198. The deduced protein
contains 203 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.6-kb
transcript in all adult and fetal tissues examined, with abundant
expression in testis, colon, a breast cancer cell line, and a lymphoma.

Tanaka et al. (1997) cloned Gt198, which they called Tbpip, from a mouse
testis cDNA library. The deduced 217-amino acid protein has several
putative phosphorylation sites. RT-PCR detected Tbpip expression in CD4
(186940)-positive T cells and in macrophages. In situ hybridization
found Tbpip mRNA colocalized with Tbp1 (186852) in seminiferous tubules
of adult mouse testis. Western blot analysis detected Tbpip at an
apparent molecular mass of 24 kD. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse
testis detected Tbpip in nuclei of primary and secondary spermatocytes.

By PCR using primers designed from mouse Tbpip, Ijichi et al. (2000)
cloned full-length human TBPIP from breast cancer cell line mRNA and a
testis cDNA library. The deduced 217-amino acid protein contains an
acidic region near the C terminus and several putative phosphorylation
sites. Mouse and human TBPIP share 88% amino acid homology.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rommens et al. (1995) mapped the TBPIP
gene to chromosome 17q21. Using radiation hybrid analysis, Ijichi et al.
(2000) mapped the TBPIP gene to chromosome 17q12-q21.

GENE FUNCTION

The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) regulatory protein Tat is
essential for HIV-1 gene expression and replication in infected cells.
TBP1 is a cellular protein that suppresses Tat-mediated transactivation
of HIV replication. Tanaka et al. (1997) found that mouse Tbpip
synergistically cooperated with Tbp1 to suppress Tat-mediated
transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter.

Ijichi et al. (2000) showed that human TBPIP interacted directly with
TBP1 and enhanced TBP1-mediated inhibition of HIV Tat-mediated
transactivation.

Enomoto et al. (2006) demonstrated that coexpression of human MND1
(611422) and HOP2 in E. coli resulted in the formation of stable
heterodimers. The HOP2-MND1 complex stimulated DMC1 (602721)- and RAD51
(179617)-mediated DNA strand exchange, and preferentially bound to a
3-stranded DNA branch, which mimics the strand-exchange intermediate.
Enomoto et al. (2006) concluded that the HOP2-MND1 complex may ensure
proper pairing between homologous chromosomes by stimulating strand
exchange during meiosis.

Chi et al. (2007) found that the Hop2 component of the mouse recombinant
Hop2-Mnd1 complex was the major DNA-binding subunit, and that Mnd1 was
the Rad51-interacting entity. Hop2-Mnd1 stabilized the
Rad51-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) nucleoprotein filament, and enhanced
the ability of the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament to capture duplex
DNA, which is an obligatory step in the formation of the synaptic
complex critical for DNA joint formation. Pezza et al. (2007) showed
that the mouse Hop2-Mnd1 complex stimulated Dmc1 to promote synaptic
complex formation on long duplex DNAs. Synaptic alignment was a
consequence of the ability of Hop2-Mnd1 to stabilize the Dmc1-ssDNA
nucleoprotein complex and facilitate the conjoining of DNA molecules
through the capture of double-stranded DNA by the Dmc1-ssDNA
nucleoprotein filament.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large consanguineous Arab Palestinian pedigree with
hypergonadotropic ovarian dysgenesis mapping to chromosome 17 (ODG3;
614324), Zangen et al. (2011) analyzed candidate genes and identified
homozygosity for a 3-bp deletion in the PSMC3IP gene (608665.0001) that
segregated with disease in the family. In cell lines, the glu201del
mutation abolished PSMC3IP activation of estrogen-driven transcription.

ANIMAL MODEL

Petukhova et al. (2003) found that Hop2 knockout mice showed no gross
anomalies in somatic tissues but developed a profound deficiency in
gametogenesis. Hop2 -/- spermatocytes arrested at the stage of
pachytene-like chromosome condensation. Axial elements were fully
developed, but synapsis was limited. While meiotic double-stranded
breaks were formed and processed in Hop2 -/- mice, they failed to be
repaired.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OVARIAN DYSGENESIS 3
PSMC3IP, 3-BP DEL, 600GAG

In affected members of a large consanguineous Arab Palestinian pedigree
with hypergonadotropic ovarian dysgenesis (ODG3; 614324), Zangen et al.
(2011) identified homozygosity for an in-frame 3-bp deletion in the
acceptor splice junction of exon 8 of the PSMC3IP gene, resulting in
deletion of glu201. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
deletion, which was not found in 254 ethnically matched chromosomes.
RT-PCR analysis of leukocyte DNA from affected and unaffected family
members showed no alternative splicing, suggesting that the mutation
does not affect PSMC3IP splicing. Transfection studies in the IGROV1
ovarian carcinoma and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines demonstrated that
the glu201del mutation abolished PSMC3IP activation of estrogen-driven
transcription.

611052	TITLE *611052 SET DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1A; SETD1A
;;SET1A;;
SET1;;
KIAA0339
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SET1A is a component of a histone methyltransferase (HMT) complex that
produces mono-, di-, and trimethylated histone H3 at Lys4. The complex
is the analog of the S. cerevisiae Set1/COMPASS complex (Lee and
Skalnik, 2005). Also see SET1B (611055).

CLONING

Wysocka et al. (2003) purified proteins associated with HCF1 (300019)
and identified a previously uncharacterized human trithorax
(159555)-related SET1/ASH2 (604782) histone methyltransferase complex
that included SET1A, the human homolog of S. cerevisiae Set1. The SET1A
protein contains 1,709 amino acids and, like yeast Set1, contains highly
conserved SET and post-SET domains at the C terminus that are related to
those of the human and Drosophila trithorax protein, as well as an
N-terminal region with similarity to the RRM RNA recognition motif found
in many RNA-binding proteins. Consistent with the presence of HCF1 in
animals but not yeast, the human and C. elegans, but not the yeast, Set1
proteins contain an HCF1-binding motif found in HCF1 Kelch
domain-binding proteins such as the transcriptional activator VP16.

GENE FUNCTION

Wysocka et al. (2003) showed that, as in yeast, the HCF1-associated
human SET1/ASH2 HMT complex possesses histone H3-K4 methylation
activity, which activates transcription. Furthermore, this activity is
blocked by premethylation of K9, a repressor of transcription,
indicating that there is crosstalk between K9 methylation and K4
methylation by the SET1/ASH2 complex. The human SET1/ASH2 HMT complex
associates with the HCF1 Kelch domain, whereas Sin3 histone deacetylase
(HDAC) (see 607776 and 601241), a chromatin-associated complex which
represses transcription, associates with the basic region. From
subsequent cosedimentation and immunoprecipitation experiments, Wysocka
et al. (2003) found that the human SET1/ASH2 complex, in mutually
exclusive interactions, can associate with HCF1 bound to Sin3 HDAC or to
HCF1 bound to VP16, indicating a diversity of transcriptional regulatory
roles.

Lee and Skalnik (2005) determined that SET1A associates with an
approximately 450-kD complex that contains 5 noncatalytic components
including ASH2, CXXC1 (609150), RBBP5 (600697), WDR5 (609012), and WDR82
(611059). By confocal microscopy, they demonstrated that SET1A and CXXC1
colocalize to nuclear speckles associated with euchromatin.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the SETD1A
gene, which they designated KIAA0339, to chromosome 16. Scott (2007)
mapped the gene to 16p11.2 based on an alignment of the SETD1A sequence
(GenBank GENBANK AB002337) with the genomic sequence (build 36.2).

608675	TITLE *608675 FUCOKINASE; FUK
;;L-FUCOSE KINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The sugar fucose is present in glycoproteins and glycolipids and is
involved in blood group antigen recognition, inflammation, and
metastasis. Fucokinase participates in a salvage pathway for
reutilization of fucose from oligosaccharide degradation (Hinderlich et
al., 2002).

CLONING

By searching sequence databases using peptides from pig fucokinase as
probes, Hinderlich et al. (2002) identified 2 full-length cDNAs encoding
human FUK. The deduced 990-amino acid FUK protein has a predicted
molecular mass of 107 kD. It contains 5 C-terminal motifs characteristic
of the ATP-binding sites of hexokinases, as well as 31 potential
phosphorylation sites evenly distributed throughout its sequence.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro assays, Hinderlich et al. (2002) showed that recombinant
FUK had fucokinase activity, with the active site located at the C
terminus.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the FUK
gene to chromosome 16 (TMAP RH44544).

607275	TITLE *607275 HOP HOMEOBOX; HOPX
;;HOMEODOMAIN-ONLY PROTEIN; HOP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database using the PAX3 (606597) homeodomain as
probe, Chen et al. (2002) identified mouse Hop. They identified human
HOP by further EST database searching. The human and mouse proteins
contain 73 amino acids, including a 60-amino acid motif homologous to
HOX proteins, and share 92% identity. They are most closely related to
the homeodomain proteins HOX6 and goosecoid (138890), with approximately
40% identity within the homeodomain-like domain. HOP lacks certain
conserved residues required for DNA binding. In mouse, Hop gene
expression initiates early in cardiogenesis and continues in
cardiomyocytes throughout embryonic and postnatal development. Northern
blot analysis of adult and embryonic mouse tissues detected a 1.2-kb
transcript in embryonic and adult heart and in adult brain, intestine,
and spleen. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that Hop is a nuclear
protein.

Shin et al. (2002) independently cloned mouse Hop and identified the
human homolog. They determined that Hop forms 3 alpha helices with a
helix-turn-helix motif characteristic of the homeodomain. Northern blot
analysis of mouse tissues detected a 1.3-kb transcript in heart, lung,
brain, and liver. Hop was highly expressed in developing heart, where
its expression was dependent on the cardiac-restricted homeodomain
protein Nkx2.5 (CSX; 600584).

GENE FUNCTION

Genetic and biochemical data indicated to Chen et al. (2002) that mouse
Hop functions directly downstream of Nkx2.5. They showed that Hop
physically interacts with serum response factor (SRF; 600589) and
inhibits activation of SRF-dependent transcription by inhibiting SRF
binding to DNA. Chen et al. (2002) concluded that HOP is an unusual
homeodomain protein that modulates SRF-dependent, cardiac-specific gene
expression and cardiac development.

Shin et al. (2002) confirmed that mouse Hop does not bind DNA and acts
as an antagonist of SRF, which regulates the opposing processes of
proliferation and myogenesis.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Kee et al. (2007) found that HOP interacted
with EPC1 (610999). Expression of Epc1 was upregulated during
differentiation of a rat myoblast cell line into skeletal myocytes.
Differentiation was induced by Epc1 overexpression and was severely
impaired in Epc1-knockdown cells. Cotransfection of Hop potentiated
Epc1-induced transactivation of myogenin (MYOG; 159980) and myotube
formation. Skeletal muscle of Hop-knockout mice showed decreased
expression of myosin heavy chain (see 160730) and myogenin, and
hamstring muscle of Hop-knockout mice showed delayed healing after
injury. Differentiation was impaired in skeletal myoblasts from
Hop-knockout mice. Kee et al. (2007) concluded that EPC1 plays a role in
initiation of skeletal muscle differentiation and that its interaction
with HOP is required for full activity.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the HOP
gene to chromosome 4 (TMAP WI-6363).

ANIMAL MODEL

Chen et al. (2002) found that inactivation of Hop in mice by homologous
recombination resulted in a partially penetrant embryonic lethal
phenotype with severe developmental cardiac defects involving the
myocardium. Inhibition of Hop activity in zebrafish embryos likewise
disrupted cardiac development and resulted in severely impaired cardiac
function.

Shin et al. (2002) showed that mice homozygous for a Hop null allele
segregated into 2 phenotypic classes characterized by an excess or
deficiency of cardiac myocytes. They proposed that Hop modulates SRF
activity during heart development and that its absence results in an
imbalance between cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation, with
consequent abnormalities in cardiac morphogenesis.

Using transgenic mice in which Hop was expressed in the heart under the
control of the alpha-MHC promoter, Kook et al. (2003) showed that Hop
can inhibit SRF-dependent transcriptional activation by recruiting
histone deacetylase (HDAC; see 601241) activity and can form a complex
that includes HDAC2 (605164). Transgenic mice overexpressing Hop
developed severe cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and premature
death. A mutant form of Hop, which does not recruit HDAC activity, did
not induce hypertrophy. Treatment of Hop transgenic mice with
trichostatin A, an HDAC inhibitor, prevented hypertrophy. Kook et al.
(2003) concluded that chromatin remodeling and repression of otherwise
active transcriptional processes can result in hypertrophy and heart
failure, and that this process can be blocked with chemical HDAC
inhibitors.

609959	TITLE *609959 MYELOID-ASSOCIATED DIFFERENTIATION MARKER; MYADM
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display analysis, Pettersson et al. (2000) identified
mouse myeloid-associated differentiation marker (Myadm) based upon its
varied expression during differentiation of an Il3 (147740)-dependent
myeloid progenitor cell line established from mouse bone marrow. The
deduced protein contains 8 potential transmembrane domains and several
potential phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis on hematopoietic
cell lines revealed restricted expression of Myadm to cells belonging to
the myeloid lineage. Expression was also seen in mature granulocytes and
macrophages. Tissue analysis showed high expression of Myadm in lung and
more moderate expression in bone marrow and brain. RT-PCR experiments
demonstrated expression of Myadm in multipotent cells
(c-kit+Sca-1+Lin-), erythroid progenitors, and early lymphoid
progenitors.

By database searching with mouse Myadm as query, Cui et al. (2002)
identified human MYADM and cloned a full-length MYADM sequence from a
human bone marrow cDNA library. The deduced 298-amino acid protein has a
predicted molecular mass of 32 kD. It contains 7 predicted transmembrane
domains and shows sequence homology with the T-cell differentiation
protein MAL (188860) and plasmolipin (PLMP; 600340). MYADM shares 75.8%
overall sequence identity with mouse Myadm, with highest levels of
conservation seen in the predicted transmembrane regions. Northern blot
analysis detected 3.3- and 2.2-kb MYADM transcripts. Expression of the
longer transcript was seen in all tissues tested except thymus;
expression of the shorter transcript was seen in heart, placenta, lung,
pancreas, testis, and peripheral blood leukocytes and was undetectable
in all other tissues. Semiquantitative PCR assays showed that expression
of MYADM was not only significantly higher in peripheral blood
leukocytes than in bone marrow cells, but was also upregulated in NB4
cells (derived from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia) that
were treated with the differentiation inducer all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA).

GENE FUNCTION

Using antisense Myadm oligonucleotides, Pettersson et al. (2000) showed
that downregulation of mouse Myadm expression in pluripotent
hematopoietic progenitor cells inhibited colony formation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cui et al. (2002) determined that the MYADM gene contains 3 exons and
spans 7.1 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Cui et al. (2002) mapped the MYADM gene to
chromosome 19q13.33-q13.4.

606801	TITLE *606801 MACROPHAGE ERYTHROBLAST ATTACHER; MAEA
;;ERYTHROBLAST MACROPHAGE PROTEIN; EMP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The association of erythroblasts with macrophages plays a central role
in the terminal maturation and enucleation of erythroblasts. MAEA
mediates attachment of erythroblasts to macrophages.

CLONING

Hanspal et al. (1998) cloned an MAEA cDNA from a human macrophage cDNA
expression library using antibody to the purified protein as probe. The
deduced 395-amino acid protein has a small N-terminal domain, a single
transmembrane domain, and a large cytoplasmic domain containing several
tyrosine residues that, when phosphorylated, could interact with protein
recognition modules. MAEA has a calculated molecular mass of 43 kD.
Recombinant protein, and protein expressed by transfected COS-7 cells,
showed an apparent molecular mass of 36 kD by SDS-PAGE. By Northern blot
analysis, Hanspal et al. (1998) found ubiquitous expression of a 2.1-kb
transcript in all tissues and cells examined. By Western blot analysis,
they identified 2 isoforms with apparent molecular masses of 36 kD and
33 kD in macrophage membranes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using several cell attachment assays, Hanspal et al. (1998) found that
both MAEA isoforms could bind erythroblasts and that binding was
mediated by the extracellular N terminus. They also determined that
MAEA-mediated cell-cell contact prevents apoptosis in maturing
erythroblasts.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MAEA
gene to chromosome 4 (TMAP WI-13069).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to YPEL1 (608082), followed by
screening a testis cDNA library, Hosono et al. (2004) cloned YPEL3. The
deduced 119-amino acid protein shares 100% amino acid identity with
mouse and monkey Ypel3 and 45.5% identity with Drosophila Yippee. YPEL3
shares 83.9 to 89.1% amino acid identity with YPEL1, YPEL2 (609723), and
YPEL4 (609725). All YPEL proteins contain an 86-amino acid YPEL
consensus sequence. PCR analysis detected YPEL3 expression in all adult
and fetal tissues examined. A second YPEL3 transcript was detected in
pancreas, placenta, and testis. Immunofluorescent staining of COS-7
green monkey kidney cells localized Ypel3 to the centrosome and
nucleolus during interphase and at several punctate structures around
the mitotic apparatus during the mitotic phase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hosono et al. (2004) determined that the YPEL3 gene contains 5 exons and
spans about 4 kb. Exon 1 is untranslated. The mouse Ypel3 gene has the
same structure.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hosono et al. (2004) mapped the human
YPEL3 gene to chromosome 16p11.2 and the mouse Ypel3 gene to chromosome
7F4.

;;MYOSIN 2, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; MYR2;;
NUCLEAR MYOSIN I; NMI
DESCRIPTION Myosins are molecular motors that, upon interaction with actin
filaments, utilize energy from ATP hydrolysis to generate mechanical
force. For further background information on myosins, see MYO1A
(601478).

CLONING

By screening a kidney cDNA library with a mouse Myo1c probe, Crozet et
al. (1997) obtained a human cDNA encoding MYO1C. The deduced 1,028-amino
acid protein, which is 96% identical to the mouse protein, contains ATP-
and actin-binding sequences in the motor (or head) domain, followed by
three 23-residue IQ motifs and a tail domain rich in basic residues that
is expected to interact with negatively charged membrane phospholipids.
Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of Myo1c in adult
mouse tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

MYO1C, also known as myosin I-beta and MYR2, was thought to mediate the
slow component of adaptation by hair cells, the sensory cells of the
inner ear. To test this hypothesis, Holt et al. (2002) mutated tyr61 of
MYO1C to gly, conferring susceptibility to inhibition by N6-modified ADP
analogs. They expressed the mutant MYO1C in utricular hair cells of
transgenic mice, delivered an ADP analog through a whole-cell recording
pipette, and found that the analog rapidly blocked adaptation to
positive and negative deflections in transgenic cells but not in
wildtype cells. The speed and specificity of inhibition suggested that
MYO1C participates in adaptation in hair cells.

Bose et al. (2002) reported that the unconventional myosin MYO1C is
present in GLUT4 (138190)-containing vesicles purified from 3T3-L1
adipocytes. MYO1C is highly expressed in primary and cultured
adipocytes. Insulin (176730) enhances the localization of MYO1C with
GLUT4 in cortical tubulovesicular structures associated with actin
filaments, and this colocalization is insensitive to wortmannin.
Insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 to the adipocyte plasma
membrane is augmented by the expression of wildtype MYO1C and inhibited
by a dominant-negative cargo domain of MYO1C. A decrease in the
expression of endogenous MYO1C mediated by small interfering RNAs
inhibited insulin-stimulated uptake of 2-deoxyglucose. Thus, Bose et al.
(2002) concluded that MYO1C functions in a
phosphatidylinositol-3-hydroxykinase (PI3K; see 601232)-independent
insulin signaling pathway that controls the movement of intracellular
GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane.

MAPPING

Using PCR and radiation hybrid analysis, Crozet et al. (1997) mapped the
MYO1C gene to 17p13.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the profilin family of actin-binding proteins (see PFN1;
176610), including PFN3, are key regulators of actin dynamics in living
cells (Braun et al., 2002).

CLONING

By database analysis using the rat Pfn3 cDNA as query, Braun et al.
(2002) identified human and mouse PFN3. The deduced 137-amino acid human
protein shares 89% amino acid identity with the mouse protein. Northern
blot analysis and RT-PCR of mouse tissues and testis detected Pfn3
expression in testis only. In situ hybridization of mouse testis
detected Pfn3 expression specifically in spermatocytes in the last
stages of spermatogenesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Braun et al. (2002) determined that the PFN3 gene contains a single
exon. It is in head-to-head orientation with the SLC34A1 gene (182309),
which is on the opposite strand.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Braun et al. (2002) mapped the PFN3 gene to

;;TESTIS-DETERMINING FACTOR; TDF;;
TESTIS-DETERMINING FACTOR ON Y; TDY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SRY encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the high mobility
group (HMG)-box family of DNA binding proteins.

CLONING

Sinclair et al. (1990) identified a gene, which they named SRY
(sex-determining region Y), within a 35-kb sex-determining region on the
human Y chromosome that was adjacent to the pseudoautosomal boundary.
The mouse homolog Sry was subsequently cloned and found to be present in
Sxr-prime mice, which have the smallest part of the Y chromosome known
to be sex-determining (Gubbay et al., 1990). Furthermore, Sry was
deleted from a mutant Y chromosome that was no longer sex-determining
(Gubbay et al., 1990).

Su and Lau (1993) found that the SRY open reading frame encodes a
deduced 204-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 24
kD. There is a DNA-binding HMG motif in the middle of the protein.

Capel et al. (1993) found that a circular Sry transcript consisting of a
single exon represented more than 90% of Sry transcripts in adult mouse
testis. In contrast, developing mouse genital ridge exclusively
expressed linear Sry transcripts. Circular Sry transcripts were not
detected in any other mouse tissue examined and were most likely
noncoding. Capel et al. (1993) noted that the human SRY gene is
transcribed into a linear form only and lacks the flanking inverted
repeats required for circular splicing.

GENOTYPE

Goodfellow and Lovell-Badge (1993) provided a major review of SRY and
sex determination in mammals.

From the study of normal males and females, persons with abnormal
numbers of sex chromosomes, and persons carrying variant Y chromosomes,
a factor (or factors) that determines the differentiation of the
indifferent gonads into testes is known to be located on the Y
chromosome and specifically on the short arm; this was designated
testis-determining factor (TDF) in the 1960s. (See Mendelian Inheritance
in Man, 4th ed., fig. 1, p. lix, 1975.)

Mittwoch (1992) argued that the 'dogma' that all differences
distinguishing male and female mammals can be traced to the presence or
absence of a single gene encoding a testis-determining factor lacks, as
she said, 'biological validity.' She suggested that the genotype of the
functional, i.e., fertile, male differs from that of a functional female
by the presence of multiple Y-chromosomal genes in association with but
a single X chromosome.

GENE FUNCTION

Lahr et al. (1995) used RT-PCR to investigate the transcription of the
Sry gene in mice. The gene was transcribed in the hypothalamus,
midbrain, and testis of adult male but not adult female mice. Whereas
the transcripts in the adult testis were circular, those in brain were
linear and therefore capable of translation. Lahr et al. (1995)
hypothesized that some male specific properties of the brain may be
generated directly by the SRY gene product.

With use of reporter plasmids, gel shift assays, and transfection
experiments, Hossain and Saunders (2001) determined that the product of
the WT1 gene (607102) transactivates SRY by binding to its promoter
region. They also found that WT1 carrying any of 4 common mutations
causing Denys-Drash syndrome failed to activate the SRY promoter.

Li et al. (2001) found that the R133W SRY mutation (607102.0019), which
lies within the HMG DNA-binding domain, had little or no effect on
specific DNA binding and bending assays, but resulted in a significant
change in cellular location of SRY upon transfection into COS-7 cells
and into a male rat gonadal ridge embryogenic cell line. In both model
cell systems, wildtype SRY localized to the nuclear compartment, whereas
the mutant SRY showed a broad distribution in the cytoplasm and nucleus
similar to that observed with deletion of the C-terminal nuclear
localization signal (NLS).

Sekido and Lovell-Badge (2008) demonstrated that Sry binds to multiple
elements within a Sox9 (608160) gonad-specific enhancer that they called
TESCO (testis-specific enhancer of Sox9 core) in mice, and that it does
so along with steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1) an orphan nuclear receptor
encoded by the gene Nr5a1 (184757). Mutation, cotransfection, and
sex-reversal studies all pointed to a feedforward, self-reinforcing
pathway in which SF1 and SRY cooperatively upregulate SOX9; then,
together with SF1, SOX9 also binds to the enhancer to help maintain its
own expression after that of SRY has ceased. Sekido and Lovell-Badge
(2008) concluded that their results permitted further characterization
of the molecular mechanisms regulating sex determination, their
evolution, and the failure of these mechanisms in cases of sex reversal.

Hansen et al. (2013) found that the mouse Sry circular RNA contains 16
putative microRNA-138 (MIR138; see 613394)-binding sites. They showed
that Sry bound Mir138 and functioned as an Mir138 sponge, reducing the
ability of Mir138 to downregulate expression of a reporter gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Su and Lau (1993) determined that SRY is an intronless gene that spans
3.8 kb. Analysis of the proximal flanking region revealed 2 GC-rich
regions containing several Sp1 (189906)-binding sites. The gene also
contains a TATAAA motif for the binding of TFIID (TAF5; 601787) and a
kappa B enhancer element for the binding of NF-kappa-B (see 164011).

MAPPING

TDF was ultimately mapped to the human Y chromosome by molecular
examination of sex-reversed patients. Analysis of 4 XX males with testes
who had minute portions of the Y material translocated to the X
chromosome was critical in defining the sex-determining region on the
human Y chromosome (Palmer et al., 1989; Sinclair et al., 1990). The
sex-determining region on the human Y chromosome was later defined to a
35-kb region of Y-specific DNA adjacent to the pseudoautosomal boundary
(Sinclair et al., 1990).

Behlke et al. (1993) found that 2 RNAs hybridized to a 4,741-bp genomic
segment of the sex-determining region of the human Y chromosome: one
transcript deriving from SRY, and a second transcript cross-hybridizing
to a pseudogene located 2.5 kb 5-prime of the SRY open reading frame.
Analysis of the SRY transcript suggested that the entire SRY protein is
encoded by a single exon.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- 46,XY Complete Gonadal Dysgenesis

Jager et al. (1990) analyzed the SRY gene in 12 XY sex-reversed females
(400044) and identified a de novo 4-bp deletion (480000.0001) in a
conserved DNA-binding motif in 1 patient.

Hawkins et al. (1992) studied the SRY gene in 5 phenotypic females with
complete gonadal dysgenesis and a 46,XY karyotype reported by Berkovitz
et al. (1991). They used single-strand conformation polymorphism assay
and DNA sequencing to screen the open reading frame and identified
mutations in 3 of the 5 patients. Like all the previously described SRY
mutations, these mutations--2 point mutations (480000.0006 and
480000.0007) and a single-base deletion (480000.0008)--altered the
putative DNA-binding region of the SRY protein.

Hawkins (1993) performed a mutation analysis of the SRY gene in XY
females. He noted that 11 mutations had been described at that time, and
all were within the DNA-binding HMG-box region of the protein.

Cameron and Sinclair (1997) stated that 26 different mutations in the
SRY gene have been found in individuals with a 46,XY karyotype. They
cited reports stating that no polymorphisms had been described in SRY
among 50 normal males. De novo mutations in the SRY HMG-box region
almost always resulted in 46,XY unambiguous females with no testicular
differentiation. They found 5 reports of familial 46,XY complete gonadal
dysgenesis associated with mutations in the SRY HMG-box region. In 4 of
these reports, the father carried the same SRY mutation as his 46,XY
daughter. None of the mutations appeared to be polymorphisms.
Explanations for the sex reversal associated with these familial SRY
mutations included paternal gonadal mosaicism for the mutation (yet to
be proven) and incomplete penetrance of the mutation. Support for a
penetrance effect came from murine studies in which at least 3 autosomal
recessive alleles were found to interact with Y-chromosome alleles,
resulting in the genesis of XY ovaries and true hermaphrodites (Eicher
and Washburn, 1986). Cameron and Sinclair (1997) noted that timing and
expression of SRY are exquisitely regulated and probably must reach a
threshold. Consequently, a given mutation in SRY against a particular
genetic background might produce sufficient SRY expression to reach the
threshold required; testis formation can then ensue, accounting for an
unaffected father.

Uehara et al. (2002) found missense mutations in the SRY gene in 2 of 3
patients with the complete form of XY gonadal dysgenesis. Combined with
the results of a previous study (Uehara et al., 1999) in which 2 of 3
complete-type patients showed SRY abnormalities, the incidence was
estimated at 67%, which is higher than previously thought. A
metaanalysis of patients with SRY abnormalities showed an incidence of
52.5% for gonadal tumor formation in patients with SRY abnormalities.
Uehara et al. (2002) gave a useful tabulation of the SRY abnormalities
that had been described.

Harley et al. (2003) examined the SRY gene from 4 XY females, each with
a missense mutation of a conserved arginine in either 1 of the 2 NLSs of
the SRY HMG box. In all cases, mutant SRY protein was partly localized
to the cytoplasm, whereas wildtype SRY was strictly nuclear. Each NLS
can independently direct nuclear transport of a carrier protein in vitro
and in vivo, with mutations in either affecting the rate and extent of
nuclear accumulation. The N-terminal NLS function is independent of the
conventional NLS-binding importins and requires cytoplasmic transport
factors, whereas the C-terminal NLS is recognized by importin-beta
(KPNB1; 602738). The SRY mutant R133W (480000.0019) showed reduced
importin-beta binding as a direct consequence of the sex-reversing
C-terminal NLS mutation. Of the 3 other N-terminal NLS mutants examined,
1 unexpectedly showed a marked reduction in importin-beta binding,
whereas the other 2 showed normal importin-beta binding, suggesting
defects in the importin-independent pathway. Harley et al. (2003)
concluded that SRY normally requires the 2 distinct NLS-dependent
nuclear import pathways to reach sufficient levels in the nucleus for
sex determination. The study documented cases of human disease that were
explained, at a molecular level, by the impaired ability of a protein to
accumulate in the nucleus.

- 46,XY True Hermaphroditism

Braun et al. (1993) reported a 46,XY true hermaphrodite who had a
mutation of SRY in gonadal DNA but not in leukocyte DNA, suggesting that
the mutation was postzygotic. Because of this finding, Fuqua et al.
(1997) attempted to determine whether postzygotic mutations of SRY might
explain the numerous cases of gonadal dysgenesis in which no SRY
mutation was detected in leukocyte DNA. They evaluated 16 subjects with
46,XY gonadal dysgenesis who had a normal SRY sequence in leukocyte DNA,
5 of them having 46,XY complete gonadal dysgenesis. They did not find
mutations in gonadal DNA from any of 16 subjects and concluded that
postzygotic mutations of SRY are a rare cause of 46,XY gonadal
dysgenesis.

Maier et al. (2003) reported a 46,XY true hermaphrodite who had a
mutation in the SRY gene (480000.0014). The father, his 3 brothers, and
his first-born son carried the identical mutation without phenotypic
effects. Maier et al. (2003) concluded that the mutated protein retained
enough activity to allow normal development in some individuals.

- 46,XX Gonadal Dysgenesis, Complete or Partial

Margarit et al. (2000) studied a 46,XX true hermaphrodite and found that
Yp-specific sequences, including the SRY gene, had been transferred to
the long arm of one of the X chromosomes at the Xq28 level. The
derivative X chromosome of the patient lacked q-telomeric sequences. The
authors suggested that this was the first report of a Yp/Xq
translocation. The coexistence of testicular and ovarian tissue in the
patient may have arisen by differential inactivation of the Y-bearing X
chromosome, in which Xq telomeric sequences were missing.

Sharp et al. (2005) studied causes of incomplete masculinization in 15
individuals with segments of Yp translocated onto Xp. Expression studies
showed little evidence for the spreading of X inactivation into Yp
chromatin; however, in several cases, disruption of gene expression
occurred independently of X inactivation, suggesting position effects
resulting from chromosomal rearrangement. In particular, 5 of 6
translocation carriers with an intersex phenotype had either
translocation breakpoints very close to SRY, or disrupted expression of
genes near SRY in a manner unrelated to X inactivation. Southern blot
analysis suggested the presence of a cryptic rearrangement 3 to 8 kb
proximal to SRY in 1 case. Sharp et al. (2005) suggested that incomplete
masculinization in cases of X/Y translocation is a result of disruption
of normal SRY expression by position effects rather than X inactivation.

Zenteno et al. (1997) described a Mexican family in which 2 brothers,
aged 28 and 26, were thought to be instances of 'classic' XX males
without genital ambiguity but were found to be negative for several
Y-chromosome sequences, including SRY. The data suggested that an
inherited loss-of-function mutation in a gene participating in the
sex-determining cascade can induce normal male sexual differentiation in
the absence of SRY.

- Mosaicism

Shahid et al. (2005) performed molecular genetics studies in 3 Turner
syndrome patients all presenting with 45,X/46,XY mosaic karyotype. Two
patients carried mutations within the HMG box, and 1 patient carried a
frameshift mutation downstream of the HMG box. The authors suggested
that lack of a second sex chromosome in a majority of cells (mosaic
karyotype and mutation in the SRY gene) in these patients may have
triggered the short stature.

Lange et al. (2009) identified 60 unrelated individuals with
isodicentric (idic) or isocentromeric (iso) Y chromosomes, 51 of which
apparently arose via a palindromic mechanism, yielding an idicYp in 49
cases and an idicYq in 2 cases, whereas the remaining 9 arose via
recombination in heterochromatic sequences, yielding an idicYp in 2
cases and an isoYp in 7 cases. As expected, the 2 individuals carrying
the idicYq chromosomes lacked the SRY gene and were phenotypic females;
however, 18 of the 58 idicYp and isoYp individuals, who had 2 copies of
SRY, were also 'sex-reversed' and raised as females or found in
childhood to have 1 degenerate ovary and 1 testis. Lange et al. (2009)
observed that the average intercentromeric distance in the feminized
individuals was twice that in the males (p less than 10(-6)), supporting
the hypothesis that mitotic instability and resultant XO mosaicism may
cause sex reversal.

EVOLUTION

Using a human SRY probe, Foster et al. (1992) identified and cloned
related genes from the Y chromosome of 2 marsupial species. Comparisons
of eutherian ('placental') and metatherian (marsupial) Y-located SRY
sequences suggested rapid evolution of these genes, especially outside
the region encoding the DNA-binding 'high mobility group' domain (HMG
box). The SRY homolog and the homolog of the mouse Ube1y were the first
genes to be identified on the marsupial Y chromosome. Whitfield et al.
(1993) and Tucker and Lundrigan (1993) likewise found that whereas the
central 'high mobility group' domain of about 78 amino acids of the SRY
protein is highly conserved, evolution in primates and in mice and rats
has been rapid in the regions flanking the conserved domain. The high
degree of sequence divergence and the frequency of nonsynonymous
mutations suggested either that the majority of the coding sequence has
no functional significance and therefore is not functionally constrained
or that it has been subject to directional selection with
species-specific adaptive divergence.

Foster and Graves (1994) identified a sequence on the marsupial X
chromosome that shares homology with SRY and shows near-identity with
the mouse and human SOX3 gene (313430; formerly called a3), the SOX gene
most closely related to SRY. Foster and Graves (1994) suggested that the
highly conserved X chromosome-linked SOX3 represents the ancestral SOX
gene from which the sex-determining SRY gene was derived.

In therian mammals (placentals and marsupials), sex is determined by an
XX female:XY male system in which the SRY gene on the Y chromosome
affects male determination. Birds have a ZW female:ZZ male system with
no homology with mammalian sex chromosomes. In birds, dosage of a
Z-borne gene, possibly DMRT1 (602424), affects male determination.
Platypus employ a sex-determining system of 5 X and 5 Y chromosomes.
Females have 2 copies of the 5 Xs; males have 5X and 5Y chromosomes,
which form an alternating XY chain during male meiosis. Veyrunes et al.
(2008) found no homology between the 10 platypus sex chromosomes and the
ancestral therian X chromosome, which is homologous to platypus
chromosome 6. Orthologs of genes in the conserved region of human X
(including SOX3, the gene from which SRY evolved) all map to platypus
chromosome 6, which therefore represents the ancestral autosome from
which the therian X and Y pair derived. The platypus X chromosomes have
substantial homology with the bird Z chromosome (including DMRT1), and
to segments syntenic with this region in the human genome. Veyrunes et
al. (2008) concluded that the therian X and Y chromosomes, including the
SRY gene, evolved from an autosomal pair after the divergence of
monotremes only 166 million years ago.

Hughes et al. (2010) finished sequencing the male-specific region of the
Y chromosome (MSY) in chimpanzee, achieving levels of accuracy and
completion previously reached for the human MSY. Comparison of the MSYs
of the 2 species showed that they differ radically in sequence structure
and gene content, indicating rapid evolution during the past 6 million
years. The chimpanzee MSY contains twice as many massive palindromes as
the human MSY, yet it has lost large fractions of the MSY protein-coding
genes and gene families present in the last common ancestor. Hughes et
al. (2010) suggested that the extraordinary divergence of the chimpanzee
and human MSYs was driven by 4 synergistic factors: the prominent role
of the MSY in sperm production, 'genetic hitchhiking' effects in the
absence of meiotic crossingover, frequent ectopic recombination within
the MSY, and species differences in mating behavior.

ANIMAL MODEL

The human and mouse Sry genes share 89% amino acid identity in their HMG
box domains, but they diverge significantly in their C termini. Coward
et al. (1994) found that Sry alleles from all mouse strains examined
encode a glutamine- and histidine-rich C-terminal domain. Sry alleles
encoding a polyglutamine tract of either 13 or 11 glutamine residues
were associated with partial (fetal) or complete sex reversal,
respectively, when introduced on a C57BL/6J background. Alleles encoding
a tract of 12 glutamine residues were not associated with sex reversal.

Only the HMG box region of the SRY gene has been conserved through
evolution, suggesting that SRY function depends solely on the HMG box
and therefore acts as an architectural transcription factor. In mice,
SRY includes a large CAG trinucleotide repeat region encoding a
C-terminal glutamine-rich domain that acts as a transcriptional
trans-activator in vitro. The absence of this or any other potential
trans-activating domain in other mammals, however, has raised doubts as
to its biologic relevance. To test directly whether the glutamine-rich
region is required for SRY function in vivo Bowles et al. (1999) created
truncation mutations of the Mus musculus SRY gene and tested their
ability to induce testis formation in XX embryos using a transgenic
mouse assay. SRY constructs that encoded proteins lacking a
glutamine-rich region were unable to effect male sex determination, in
contrast to their wildtype counterparts. Bowles et al. (1999) concluded
that the glutamine-rich repeat domain of the mouse SRY protein has an
essential role in sex determination in vivo and that SRY may act via a
fundamentally different biochemical mechanism in mice compared with
other mammals.

Nef et al. (2003) demonstrated that the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase
family, comprising INSR (147670), IGF1R (147370), and IRR (147671), is
required for the appearance of male gonads and thus for male sexual
differentiation in mice. XY mice that were mutant for all 3 receptors
developed ovaries and showed a completely female phenotype. Reduced
expression of both Sry and the early testis-specific marker Sox9
(608160) indicated that the insulin signaling pathway is required for
male sex determination.

In 6 sterile heifers that were female in appearance and in genital
organs, Kawakura et al. (1996) found that blood, skin, spleen, and
kidney showed a normal male 60,XY karyotype. Although the SRY gene was
detected by PCR in a normal bulls, it was not detected in normal cows or
in 3 60,XY female bovine cases studied.

HISTORY

Page et al. (1987) cloned part or all of what they thought to be the TDF
gene, found that some sequences were highly conserved in mammals and
even birds, and showed that the nucleotide sequence of the conserved DNA
codes for zinc finger domains. ZFY (zinc finger protein, Y-linked;
314980) was the designation approved by the HGM workshop committee, with
ZFX being the X-linked counterpart. ZFY proved, however, not to be TDF
(Palmer et al., 1989).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, 4-BP DEL, NT773

Jager et al. (1990) demonstrated a mutation in SRY in 1 of 12
sex-reversed XY females with gonadal dysgenesis (400044) who had no
large deletions of the short arm of the Y chromosome. They found a 4-bp
deletion (nucleotides 773-776) in the part of the SRY gene that encodes
a conserved DNA-binding motif. A frameshift presumably led to a
nonfunctional protein. Mutation occurred de novo, because the father had
a normal SRY sequence. This provided strong evidence that SRY is TDF.
The de novo G-to-A mutation led to a change from methionine to
isoleucine. Hawkins (1993) noted that the mutation is in the HMG box of
SRY.

46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, PHE109SER

In an XY female with gonadal dysgenesis (400044), her father, her 2
brothers and an uncle, Jager et al. (1992) found a T-to-C transition in
the region of the SRY gene coding for a protein motif known as the high
mobility group (HMG) box, a protein domain known to confer DNA-binding
specificity on the SRY protein. The mutation resulted in the
substitution, at amino acid position 109, of a serine residue for
phenylalanine, a conserved aromatic residue in almost all HMG box motifs
known. This F109S mutation was not found in 176 male controls. When
recombinant wildtype SRY and SRY(F109S) mutant protein were tested in
vitro for binding to the target site AAC AAAG, no differences in
DNA-binding activity were observed. These results implied that the F109S
mutation either is a rare neutral sequence variant, or produces an SRY
protein with slightly altered in vivo activity, the resulting sex
phenotype depending on the genetic background or environmental factors.
The proband had primary amenorrhea and was 180 cm tall. Prior to
therapy, mammary development was at stage III (Tanner). No signs of
virilization were found. At laparotomy, bilateral streak gonads,
atrophic fallopian tubes, and a rudimentary uterus with a narrow lumen
were detected. Although the paternal uncle with the F109S mutation had
an undescended right testis, the family was unremarkable with regard to
infertility, gynecologic tumors, and abnormal sex phenotypes.

.0004
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, VAL60LEU

Vilain et al. (1992) described a family in which all 5 XY individuals in
2 generations had a single basepair substitution resulting in an amino
acid change in the conserved domain of the SRY open reading frame. A
G-to-C transversion at nucleotide 588 resulted in substitution of
leucine for valine-60. Three of the individuals were XY sex-reversed
females (400044) and 2 were XY males. One of the males had 8 children;
all were phenotypic females, 2 of whom were the sex-reversed XY males
carrying the mutation mentioned. Several models were proposed to explain
association between a sequence variant in SRY and 2 alternative sex
phenotypes. These explanations included the existence of alleles at an
unlinked locus.

46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, GLN93TER

McElreavey et al. (1992) described an XY sex-reversed female with pure
gonadal dysgenesis (400044) who harbored a de novo nonsense mutation in
SRY, which resulted directly in the formation of a stop codon in the
putative DNA-binding motif. A C-to-T transition at nucleotide 687
changed a glutamine codon (CAG) to a termination codon (TAG). The
patient, referred to by the authors as the 'propositus,' was a
phenotypic female who presented at age 20 years for primary amenorrhea.
Treatment with estrogen induced menstruation and slight enlargement of
the breasts which were underdeveloped. Laparotomy showed 2 streak gonads
without germ cells or remnants of tubes.

.0006
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
46,XY TRUE HERMAPHRODITISM, INCLUDED
SRY, ILE90MET

In 'patient 213' (patient 4 in the report of Berkovitz et al., 1991), a
phenotypic female with complete gonadal dysgenesis and a 46,XY karyotype
(400044), Hawkins et al. (1992) identified a C-G transversion at
nucleotide 680, causing an isoleucine-to-methionine amino acid
substitution within the HMG box. The father and brother of patient 213
also carried the mutation, which was not found in 78 ethnically matched
unrelated males. The authors noted that in vitro studies by Harley et
al. (1992) demonstrated that the I90M mutant had reduced DNA-binding
activity.

Dork et al. (1998) observed this mutation in a patient unrelated to that
reported by Hawkins et al. (1992). None of the previously reviewed
mutations had been observed in more than a single family. In 3 cases,
however, fertile fathers were found to share the same SRY mutation with
their sex-reversed daughters (Berta et al., 1990; Jager et al., 1992;
Vilain et al., 1992). In the absence of mosaicism, there are plausible
explanations for these familiar variants. The variant could fortuitously
occur in a family segregating for a different sex-reversing gene, or the
variant may predispose toward sex reversal and cause a differentiation
effect only in association with other genetic or environmental factors.
In the case reported by Hawkins et al. (1992), I90M was likewise
associated with complete gonadal dysgenesis in the proband but was also
present in normal relatives of the patient, including the father. Thus,
Dork et al. (1998) concluded that this appears to be an instance of a
Y-linked inherited disorder with incomplete penetrance and suggested
that identification of unrelated individuals carrying the I90M mutation
may help to elucidate the mechanism.

Maier et al. (2003) reported a 46,XY true hermaphrodite (400045) who had
the I90M mutation in the SRY gene. The father, 3 uncles, and an older
brother carried the identical mutation without phenotypic effects. Maier
et al. (2003) concluded that the mutated protein retained enough
activity to allow normal development in some individuals.

In their 'patient 207' (patient 5 of Berkovitz et al., 1991) with
complete gonadal dysgenesis and a 46,XY karyotype (400044), Hawkins et
al. (1992) identified an A-T transversion at nucleotide 727, resulting
in a lysine-to-isoleucine substitution within the HMG box.

In their 'patient 208' (patient 6 of Berkovitz et al., 1991) with
complete gonadal dysgenesis and a 46,XY karyotype (400044), Hawkins et
al. (1992) found deletion of nucleotide 734 causing a frameshift. The
father and brother of patient 208 did not share the deletion, indicating
that the mutation was de novo. Hawkins (1993) noted that the mutation is
in the HMG box of SRY.

46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, ALA113THR

In a Chinese XY female with gonadal dysgenesis (Swyer syndrome; 400044),
Zeng et al. (1993) described a G-to-A transition in codon 113 resulting
in a change from alanine to threonine. This residue lies within the
putative DNA binding motif.

.0010
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, TRP107TER

Iida et al. (1994) identified a single basepair substitution within the
HMG box of the SRY gene in a 28-year-old married Japanese woman with a
history of primary amenorrhea and infertility. Physical examination
showed an apparently normal female with a weight of 62 kg and a height
of 170.5 cm. While the external genitalia were those of a female, they
were infantile with no hypertrophy of the clitoris. The vagina was
normal and a cervix was present. The uterus was normal in shape and
position. Laboratory examination demonstrated that the amenorrhea was
due to ovarian failure. There was no elevation of androgen levels. The
karyotype was 46,XY (400044). Both gonads were partially resected
because of the risk of malignant development and showed fibroadipose
tissue with no malignant cells and no ovarian or testicular components.
By single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by direct
sequencing, Iida et al. (1994) demonstrated a GGT to GAT substitution in
codon 107, counted from the initiation site of the gene, which predicted
a change from a tryptophan residue to a termination codon.

.0011
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, ILE68THR

This mutation, which caused sex reversal in a female patient with a
46,XY karyotype (400044), was used by Haqq et al. (1994) to demonstrate
that the structural interactions of the HMG box with DNA was altered to
result in failure to induce transcription of the gene for mullerian
inhibiting substance. The normal protein-DNA interaction consists of
partial side chain intercalation into a widened minor groove.

Studying this same mutation, Peters et al. (1995) demonstrated that 2
DNA-binding activities of SRY could be distinguished. The
sequence-specific recognition of duplex DNA must be required for male
sex determination because it was eliminated by this mutation in the SRY
HMG box. However, the sequence-independent binding to the sharp angles
of 4-way DNA junctions was not affected.

In an XY female (400044), Berta et al. (1990) identified a G-to-A
transition in the SRY gene resulting in a change from methionine-64 to
isoleucine. This residue lies within the HMG box. The mutation was
presumed to be de novo because it was not found in the patient's father
or brother.

.0013
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, TRP70TER

In an XY female (400044), Hawkins et al. (1992) identified a G-to-A
transition at codon 70 of SRY which results in a stop codon at trp70.
This residue lies within the HMG box.

46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, LYS92TER

In an XY female (400044), Muller et al. (1992) identified an A-to-T
transversion at codon 92 of the SRY gene which results in a stop codon
at lys92. This residue lies within the HMG box.

.0016
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, GLY95ARG

In an XY female (400044), Hawkins et al. (1992) identified a G-to-C
transversion resulting in a change from glycine-95 to arginine. This
residue lies within the HMG box.

46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, TYR4TER

Veitia et al. (1997) reported a T-to-A transversion occurring at
nucleotide 12 in the SRY gene, resulting in a premature termination
codon prior to the HMG box. This was a de novo substitution in a
completely sex-reversed patient (400044).

.0019
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, ARG133TRP

Veitia et al. (1997) found a de novo recurrence of the C-to-T transition
which gave rise to the arg133trp mutation first reported by Affara et
al. (1993). Both patients had pure gonadal dysgenesis (400044). The arg
at codon 133 was conserved in the SRY gene of all species studied at
that time.

.0020
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, GLN2TER

Brown et al. (1998) described a 28-year-old West Indian woman with the
primary complaint of infertility. She reported menarche and normal
breast development at age 13 to 14 years and had had regular monthly
menses until age 17 years, when she electively began oral
contraceptives, which she continued until age 25 years. Irregular menses
resumed with the discontinuation of oral contraception and for the 2
subsequent years she attempted to become pregnant. She had been treated
with clomiphene citrate for presumed anovulation. She appeared normally
feminized, and her physical examination, including her gynecological
examination, was entirely normal, except for the fact that she was 193
cm tall. Specifically, she was not hirsute and had no stigmata of Turner
syndrome. Breasts and pubic hair were Tanner stage 4. A chromosome
analysis showed a 46,XY karyotype (400044). At laparoscopy, the gonads
appeared to be white fibrous streaks and were removed without
difficulty. Study of all cells failed to detect any with either 2 X
chromosomes or without a Y chromosome. The excised gonad from the right
side consisted entirely of fibroadipose tissue; the left gonad contained
a small amount of ovarian stromal-like tissue. No follicles were seen;
however, a cluster of tubular structures was present. Fibroblast-like
cells cultured from both gonadal tissue samples also had a pure XY
karyotype. Analysis of the SRY gene revealed a C-to-T transition in the
second codon, predicted to create a stop codon (gln2ter). The same
mutation was found in the gonads of each side. There was no evidence of
mosaicism. The patient's father's SRY gene showed an entirely normal
sequence. Paternity was proved by the expected segregation of
polymorphic PCR-based markers.

A mouse with a heritable mutation in the testis-determining gene was
described by Lovell-Badge and Robertson (1990). XY mice with this
mutation are fertile females, although fertility is reduced and their
ovaries fail early, a picture similar to that in the patient reported by
Brown et al. (1998).

.0021
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, SER18ASN

In 1 of 21 Brazilian patients with 46,XY sex reversal (400044), Domenice
et al. (1998) found a ser18-to-asn (S18N) missense mutation upstream of
the 5-prime border of the HMG box of the SRY gene. The variant sequence
was also found in DNA obtained from blood and sperm of his father and in
blood cells of his normal brother. The S18N mutation was not found in 50
normal males, ruling out the possibility of a common polymorphism. The
patient had been evaluated at 4 years of age for ambiguous genitalia,
characterized by microphallus, perineal hypospadias, bifid scrotum, and
a gonad in the left inguinal region. His basal serum testosterone level
was 16 ng/dl rising to 189 ng/dl after hCG stimulation. Histologic study
showed a right streak gonad, a left dysgenic testis, and the presence of
both wolffian and mullerian ducts. His brother at 18 years of age had
normal male external genitalia with complete development of secondary
sexual characteristics. The father was a 43-year-old phenotypically
normal male.

Canto et al. (2000) performed molecular studies of the SRY gene in 3
patients with an Ullrich-Turner syndrome (see 163950) phenotype and
bilateral streaks; 2 were 45,X/46,XY mosaic, and the third had a Y
marker chromosome. In 2 of the patients, the authors identified an S18N
mutation in the 5-prime non-HMG box region in DNA from blood and both
streaks. This mutation was not identified in 5 normal males. Sequencing
of the DNA region was normal in the father and older brother of patient
1, demonstrating that in this patient the mutation was de novo. The
authors concluded that the previous report of a 46,XY patient with
partial gonadal dysgenesis and the same mutation indicates the probable
existence of a hotspot in this region of the SRY gene and strengthens
the possibility that all gonadal dysgeneses constitute a spectrum of the
same disorder. They also pointed out that this single genetic
abnormality can result in a wide range of phenotypic expression.

.0022
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, GLY95GLU

Schaffler et al. (2000) described a nonmosaic XY sex-reversed female
with pure gonadal dysgenesis (46,XY karyotype, completely female
external genitalia, normal mullerian ducts, absence of wolffian ducts,
and streak gonads; 400044) who harbored a yolk-sac tumor and was
referred for the assessment of primary amenorrhea. They identified a
novel de novo mutation, a G-to-A transition at position 284 within the
HMG box of the SRY gene, resulting in a gly95-to-glu substitution. This
mutation was not detected in the patient's father or in her male sibs.
The authors concluded that these data provide further evidence to
support the functional importance of the putative DNA-binding activity
of the SRY HMG box.

.0023
46,XY SEX REVERSAL 1
SRY, TYR127PHE

Jordan et al. (2002) reported an A-to-T transversion at nucleotide 380
(with respect to the initiation codon) in the SRY gene that resulted in
a tyr127-to-phe (Y127F) substitution in the protein. This sequence
variant was found not only in the XY female patient (400044) but also in
her father, a phenotypically normal male. However, the Y127F variant was
not found in the SRY sequences of 93 other randomly chosen males. This
substitution affects a highly conserved TYR residue in the HMG box of
SRY. Furthermore, electromobility shift studies demonstrate that SRY
protein harboring the Y127F variant is incapable of binding consensus
SRY binding sites in vitro. Taken together, these data suggested that
the variant is a novel mutation with functional consequences. The
authors concluded that this allelic SRY variant shared by both an
affected female and her normal father emphasizes the importance of
modifier genes in the sex determination pathway.

606194	TITLE *606194 KERATIN 23; KRT23
;;K23
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Keratin-23 is a member of the type I keratin family (Zhang et al.,
2001).

CLONING

Sodium butyrate (NaBu) induces differentiation and apoptosis in human
pancreatic cancer cell lines. By a suppression subtractive
hybridization-based technique, Zhang et al. (2001) identified a novel
intermediate filament protein, designated KRT23, that is highly induced
upon NaBu treatment of pancreatic cancer cells. The KRT23 cDNA expresses
a 1.65-kb mRNA encoding a deduced 422-amino acid protein that shares 42
to 46% sequence identity with other type I keratins within the
alpha-helical rod domain. Trichostatin A, a potent and specific
inhibitor of histone deacetylase, similarly induced KRT23 mRNA
expression. Treatment with either actinomycin D or cycloheximide
efficiently blocked the induction of KRT23 mRNA by either sodium
butyrate or trichostatin A. The results suggested that KRT23 is a novel
member of the acidic keratin family that is induced in pancreatic cancer
cells undergoing differentiation by a mechanism involving histone
hyperacetylation. The authors also showed that expression of
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) is necessary for
efficient induction of KRT23 mRNA bu histone deacetylase inhibitors.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using database analysis and protein profiling to identify human
orthologs of yeast cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly proteins,
followed by PCR of a heart cDNA library, Szklarczyk et al. (2012) cloned
PET100. Mouse heart Pet100 localized to mitochondria.

GENE FUNCTION

Szklarczyk et al. (2012) showed that epitope-tagged PET100 copurified
with the COX assembly protein COX17 (604813) from transfected HEK293
cells.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the PET100 gene to chromosome 19p13.2 based on an
alignment of the PET100 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK124717) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

604174	TITLE *604174 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L15; RPL15
DESCRIPTION The mammalian ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species (see 180450) and
approximately 80 different proteins (see 180466).

Adams et al. (1992) isolated an RPL15 cDNA as a human brain EST that
shows sequence similarity to the yeast ribosomal protein YL10 gene.

The complete coding sequence of the human RPL15 gene has been deposited
in GenBank (GENBANK L25899). The deduced RPL15 protein has 205 amino
acids.

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid mapping analyses, Kenmochi
et al. (1998) mapped the human RPL15 gene to 3p.

609618	TITLE *609618 NONCODING REPRESSOR OF NFAT; NRON
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a remarkably sensitive
transcription factor responsive to local changes in calcium signals, is
essential for T cell receptor-mediated immune response and plays a
critical role in the development of heart and vasculature, musculature,
and nervous tissue. See 600489. Willingham et al. (2005) selected 512
mouse noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) with significant human homology and
designed short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against the human orthologs of
these sequences. Using cell-based knockdown assays, they identified 1
ncRNA that, when targeted with shRNAs, resulted in a dramatic activation
of NFAT activity. Willingham et al. (2005) termed this ncRNA 'noncoding
repressor of NFAT' (NRON). The NRON gene has 2 large 300- to 400-bp
regions of near-perfect sequence conservation between rodents and
primates. NRON is a relatively rare transcript that is enriched in
placenta, muscle, and lymphoid tissues such as the thymus, spleen, and
lymph node. Northern blot analysis of mouse RNA showed significant NRON
expression in embryo and thymus. Willingham et al. (2005) demonstrated a
distinct tissue-specific distribution of NRON splice forms which,
particularly in its enrichment in lymphoid tissues, is consistent with
its role as a modulator of NFAT signaling.

GENE FUNCTION

Willingham et al. (2005) found that NRON specifically interacts with 11
proteins, including 3 members of the importin-beta superfamily, factors
which directly mediate the nucleocytoplasmic transport of cargoes such
as NFAT. Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) directed against 4 of these 11
putative interactors, a calmodulin-binding protein (IQGAP1; 603379), a
nuclear transport factor (KPNB1; 602738), the structural subunit of a
phosphatase (PPP2R1A; 605983), and a component of the proteasome
(PSMD11; 604449), all activated NFAT activity. cDNA overexpression of
these 4 interactors had the opposite effect and repressed NFAT activity.
Therefore, these 4 proteins, together with NRON, have a repressive
effect on NFAT signaling. Willingham et al. (2005) demonstrated that
cell extracts containing overexpressed importin beta-1 (KPNB1) bound
significantly more NRON than did a nonspecific RNA control, suggesting
that importin beta-1 and NRON directly associate. These and other
findings suggested to Willingham et al. (2005) that NRON functions as an
RNA component of a protein complex that acts to repress NFAT activity.
The authors observed that NRON modulates the calcium-regulated
transcriptional activity of NFATC1 (600849), NFATC2 (600490), NFATC3
(602698), and NFATC4 (602699). Additional data suggested that rather
than directly modulating the transcriptional activity of NFAT itself,
NRON likely regulates NFAT's subcellular localization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Willingham et al. (2005) found that the NRON gene is composed of 3 exons
that can be alternatively spliced to yield transcripts ranging from 0.8
to 3.7 kb.

180535	TITLE *180535 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S15; RPS15
;;RAT INSULINOMA GENE HOMOLOG; RIG
DESCRIPTION The gene called Rig (rat insulinoma gene) was first isolated from a cDNA
library of rat insulinomas. Its cognate gene has been found to be
activated in various human tumors such as insulinomas, esophageal
cancers, and colon cancers. Inoue et al. (1987) isolated a human
insulinoma cDNA encoding the human homolog of Rig. Structural analysis
indicated that the predicted 145-amino acid RIG protein may be a
DNA-binding protein. Shiga et al. (1990) isolated the genomic sequence
of human RIG from a genomic DNA library constructed from a human
esophageal carcinoma and determined its complete nucleotide sequence.
The gene is composed of about 3,000 nucleotides and divided into 4 exons
separated by 3 introns. The transcription initiation site was located
-46 bp upstream from the first ATG codon. Because of CpG islands in the
5-prime region and regions with a high GC content and because of the
wide expression of RIG in tissues and cells, Shiga et al. (1990)
suggested that RIG may belong to the class of 'housekeeping' genes,
whose products are necessary for the growth of all cell types. The human
genome contains at least 6 copies of RIG pseudogenes, 4 of which have
the characteristics of processed pseudogenes. Kitagawa et al. (1991)
demonstrated the normal function of Rig. They showed that the
immunoreactivity to a monoclonal antibody against the deduced Rig
protein and the translation product of Rig mRNA comigrated with
ribosomal protein S15. The amino acid sequence of ribosomal protein S15
purified from rat liver coincided with that deduced from the nucleotide
sequence of Rig mRNA, but there were indications that the initiator
methionine was removed and the succeeding alanyl residue was
monoacetylated. The authors concluded that the product of the Rig gene
is ribosomal protein S15.

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid mapping analyses, Kenmochi
et al. (1998) mapped the human RPS15 gene to 19p.

603762	TITLE *603762 PHOSPHORIBOSYLPYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; PRPSAP2
;;PAP41
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) is a primary substrate and a critical
control factor for de novo synthesis of purine and pyrimidine
nucleotides, histidine, tryptophan, and NAD. The enzyme PRPP synthetase
(PRPS), which catalyzes the formation of PRPP, exists in an aggregate
composed of 2 catalytic subunits, PRPS I (PRPS1; 311850) and PRPS II
(PRPS2; 311860), and 2 associated subunits, PAP39 (601249) and PAP41. By
searching an EST database for sequences related to PAP39, Katashima et
al. (1998) identified cDNAs encoding PAP41. The predicted 369-amino acid
protein exhibited 72%, 51%, and 50% sequence identity with PAP39, PRPS2,
and PRPS2, respectively. The rat and human PAP41 proteins are 99%
identical. Northern blot analysis revealed that PAP41 is expressed as a
2.1-kb mRNA in several human cell lines.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Katashima et al. (1998) mapped
the PRPSAP2 gene to 17p12-p11.2.

607764	TITLE *607764 3-@BETA-HYDROXY-DELTA-5-C27-STEROID OXIDOREDUCTASE; HSD3B7
;;C27-3-BETA-HSD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Schwarz et al. (2000) used expression cloning to isolate cDNAs encoding
a microsomal 3-beta-hydroxy-delta-5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase that is
expressed predominantly in the liver. The predicted product showed 34%
sequence identity with the C19 and C21 3-beta-HSD enzymes, which
participate in steroid hormone metabolism. Schwarz et al. (2000)
observed that, when transfected into cultured cells, the enzyme encoded
by the C27 3-beta-HSD cDNA was active against four 7-alpha-hydroxylated
sterols, indicating that a single C27 3-beta-HSD enzyme can participate
in all pathways of bile acid synthesis known to that time. The expressed
enzyme did not metabolize several different C19/21 steroids as
substrates. The levels of hepatic C27 3-beta-HSD mRNA in the mouse were
not sexually dimorphic and did not change in response to dietary
cholesterol or to changes in bile acid pool size. The human C27
3-beta-HSD gene encodes a protein of 369 amino acids that is about 86%
identical to the mouse protein.

MAPPING

Schwarz et al. (2000) mapped the human HSD3B7 gene to chromosome
16p12-p11.2 by analysis of radiation hybrid panels.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schwarz et al. (2000) determined that the HSD3B7 gene contains 6 exons
and spans 3 kb of DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Schwarz et al. (2000) observed that the C27 3-beta-HSD enzymes are
active only against 7-alpha hydroxylated sterol substrates. Human C27
3-beta-HSD enzymes were active against the 7-alpha hydroxylated forms of
24-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol
and showed no preference for any of those compounds. Northern blot
analysis identified a single 2.4-kb species present at high levels in
liver, pancreas, and kidney, and at lower levels in heart, skeletal
muscle, and placenta.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Schwarz et al. (2000) identified a 2-bp deletion in the C27 3-beta-HSD
gene (607764.0001) in a patient with a congenital defect in bile acid
synthesis (CBAS1; 607765) and neonatal cholestasis.

Cheng et al. (2003) performed a molecular analysis of 15 additional
patients from 13 kindreds with C27 3-beta-HSD deficiency deficiency and
identified 12 different mutations in the HSD3B7 gene (see, e.g.,
607764.0001-607764.0005). They studied 10 mutations in detail; these
were shown to cause complete loss of enzyme activity and, in 2 cases,
alterations in the size or amount of the transcribed RNA. Mutations were
homozygous in 13 patients from 10 families and heterozygous in 4
patients from 3 families. Cheng et al. (2003) concluded that a diverse
spectrum of HSD3B7 mutations underlies this rare form of neonatal
cholestasis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BILE ACID SYNTHESIS DEFECT, CONGENITAL, 1
HSD3B7, 2-BP DEL, NT1057

In a Saudi Arabian boy with neonatal progressive intrahepatic
cholestasis (607765), the fifth child of consanguineous parents in the
family originally described by Clayton et al. (1987), Schwarz et al.
(2000) identified a 2-bp deletion in exon 6 of the HSD3B7 gene. This
mutation was found in homozygosity and was not present in 25 healthy
controls. It was predicted to shift the translational reading frame,
causing premature termination and the removal of 23 amino acids from the
carboxy terminus of the protein. In vitro studies showed that the
protein carrying the 2-bp deletion prevented the production of enzyme
capable of isomerizing and oxidizing the 7-alpha-hydroxylated forms of
24-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol.

Cheng et al. (2003) confirmed this mutation in the family of Clayton et
al. (1987) and found it in a second consanguineous Saudi family. They
determined that the 1057deltaCT mutation gives rise to a protein in
which the first 346 amino acids of the normal protein are fused to a
5-residue extension. The mutation was found to produce mRNAs that were
similar in size and amount to those derived from the normal gene but
failed to encode an active enzyme when introduced into HEK293 cells. It
was not known whether inactivation resulted from elimination of the
normal C-terminal sequences or addition of the spurious residues.

In 2 French families with neonatal cholestasis caused by C27 3-beta-HSD
deficiency (607765), Cheng et al. (2003) found a missense mutation in
HSD3B7, glu147 to lys (E147K). The amino acid substitution resulted from
a G-to-A transition in exon 4. Although an apparently stable mRNA of
normal abundance was transcribed from the mutant gene, no enzyme
activity was detected in transfected cells. Glutamate-147 is conserved
among all members of the 3-beta-HSD enzyme family in human, mouse, and
rat.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A cascade of protease reactions is believed to be responsible for the
apoptotic changes observed in mammalian cells undergoing programmed cell
death. This cascade involves members of the aspartate-specific cysteine
proteases of the ICE/CED3 (147678) family, also known as the caspase
family.

CLONING

Fernandes-Alnemri et al. (1996) identified the novel gene MCH5 when they
found a human EST sequence with significant homology to the newly
identified cysteine protease MCH4 (601762). They used PCR to clone a
cDNA of the MCH5 gene from a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library. Sequence
analysis revealed that it encodes a polypeptide of 496 amino acids with
greatest homology to MCH4. The authors found that MCH4 and MCH5 both
contain the active site pentapeptide QACQG instead of the QACRG present
in all other known members of the family. Furthermore, the authors found
that the sequences of MCH4 and MCH5 contain Fas-associating protein with
death domain (FADD)-like domains, suggesting possible interaction with
FADD. Fernandes-Alnemri et al. (1996) stated that MCH5, like other
members of the ICE/CED3 family, forms an active protease only after
cleavage of its proenzyme into 2 subunits which dimerize to form the
active enzyme.

Using MORT1 (FADD; 602457) in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a B-cell cDNA
library, Boldin et al. (1996) cloned several splice variants of CASP8,
which they called MACH. The isoforms could be divided into 2 main
subgroups. All isoforms share a common 182-amino acid N-terminal region,
including 2 MORT modules (i.e., death effector domains, or DEDs), but
they have different C termini. Subgroup alpha isoforms have C termini
containing a CED3/ICE homology domain that contains the catalytic site
and the substrate-binding pocket, while subgroup beta isoforms are
truncated and lack the CED3/ICE homology domain. The longest isoform,
MACH-alpha-1, encodes a deduced 479-amino acid protein. The CED3/ICE
domain of MACH-alpha-1 shares 41% and 34% identity with the homologous
regions in CPP32 (CASP3; 600636) and C. elegans CED3, respectively.
Northern blot analysis detected MACH transcripts ranging in size between
2.85 and 3.5 kb in all tissues examined, with highest levels in resting
peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes and lowest levels in testis and
skeletal muscle.

Eckhart et al. (2001) identified several CASP8 splice variants that
preferentially use a distant splice donor site at the 3-prime end of
exon 8. Use of this distant site, which they called exon 8b, results in
mRNAs with truncated open reading frames. RT-PCR indicated equal
expression of both mRNA species in tonsil, spleen, bone marrow, thymus,
and lymph nodes. Peripheral blood leukocytes, heart, and epidermis
predominantly expressed mRNA containing exon 8b, as did a promyelocytic
cell line and a T-cell line. Liver and nearly all immortalized cell
lines, as well as primary endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and
keratinocytes, expressed mRNA lacking the 8b extension.

GENE FUNCTION

Using fluorogenic peptide substrates corresponding to a sequence within
the nuclear protein PARP (173870), Boldin et al. (1996) confirmed that
MACH-alpha-1 is a thiol protease. By site-directed mutagenesis, they
identified cys360 as the catalytic cysteine. Using mutation analysis,
Boldin et al. (1996) determined that MACH binds to the N terminus of
MORT1. They also found that it self-associates, but it does not interact
directly with FAS/APO1 (TNRFSF6; 134637). Transfection of human
embryonic kidney cells and breast carcinoma cells with MACH-alpha-1 or
MACH-alpha-2 resulted in massive cell death.

Muzio et al. (1996) determined that CASP8, which they called FLICE,
interacts with wildtype FADD but not with FADD lacking the DED. They
also determined that granzyme B (GZMB; 123910) can remove the prodomain
and generate the active p20/p10 dimeric cysteine protease. Cleavage of
PARP by CASP8 resulted in the appearance of signature apoptotic
fragments. Transfection and overexpression of CASP8 in transfected
breast cancer cells resulted in apoptosis.

Expression of cDNAs that encode truncated polypeptides containing mostly
expanded polyglutamine repeats, but not of those that encode the
corresponding full-length proteins, has been shown to induce cell death
by apoptosis. Such truncated proteins have been shown to form aggregates
or inclusions (Ikeda et al., 1996). Sanchez et al. (1999) studied the
role of caspases in polyglutamine-induced cell death in established
cultures of primary cortical, striatal, and cerebellar neurons from
embryonic day 17 rat embryos, transfected with an expression construct
encoding truncated ataxin-3 that contained 79 glutamine (Q79) residues.
The authors showed that the apoptosis inhibitors Bcl2, CrmA, and a
truncated Fas/APO1-associated death domain protein (FADD DN) inhibited
polyglutamine repeat-induced neuronal cell death. A mutant Jurkat cell
line specifically lacking caspase-8 was resistant to
polyglutamine-induced cell death. Cells transfected with Q79 showed
insoluble inclusions. Caspase-8 was recruited and activated by these Q79
inclusions. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of activated
caspase-8 in the insoluble fraction of affected brain regions from
Huntington disease (143100) patients but not in those from controls. The
authors suggested that caspase-8 has an essential role in
Huntington-related neurodegenerative diseases.

Eckhart et al. (2001) found that different CASP8 isoforms were expressed
in resting and activated lymphocytes. Activation of lymphocytes shifted
the expression from mRNA species containing an exon 8b extension to
mRNAs that lack it. Differentiation in a promyelocytic cell line was
associated with the opposite shift, from mRNAs containing the shorter
exon 8 to mRNAs that include the exon 8b extension.

Gervais et al. (2002) found that HIP1 (601767) binds to the HIP1 protein
interactor (HIPPI; 606621), which has partial sequence homology to HIP1
and similar tissue and subcellular distribution. The availability of
free HIP1 is modulated by polyglutamine length within huntingtin
(613004), with disease-associated polyglutamine expansion favoring the
formation of proapoptotic HIPPI-HIP1 heterodimers. This heterodimer can
recruit procaspase-8 into a complex of HIPPI, HIP1, and procaspase-8,
and launch apoptosis through components of the extrinsic cell death
pathway. Gervais et al. (2002) proposed that huntingtin polyglutamine
expansion liberates HIP1 so that it can form a caspase-8 recruitment
complex with HIPPI, possibly contributing to neuronal death in
Huntington disease.

Yu et al. (2004) defined a novel molecular pathway in which activation
of the receptor-interacting protein (RIP; 603453), a serine-threonine
kinase, and Jun amino-terminal kinase (601158) induced cell death with
the morphology of autophagy. Autophagic death required the genes ATG7
(GSA7; 608760) and beclin-1 (604378) and was induced by caspase-8
inhibition. Yu et al. (2004) cautioned that clinical therapies involving
caspase inhibitors may arrest apoptosis but also have the unanticipated
effect of promoting autophagic cell death.

Poulaki et al. (2005) found that human retinoblastoma (RB1; 614041) cell
lines were resistant to death receptor (see DR5; 603612)-mediated
apoptosis because of a deficiency of CASP8 expression secondary to
epigenetic gene silencing by overmethylation. Treatment with a
demethylating agent restored CASP8 expression and sensitivity to
apoptosis.

Su et al. (2005) showed that caspase-8 deficiency (607271) in humans and
mice specifically abolishes activation of the transcription factor NF
kappa-B (164011) after stimulation through antigen receptors, Fc
receptors, or Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4; 603030) in T, B, and natural
killer cells. Caspase-8 also causes the alpha-beta complex of the
inhibitor of NF-kappa-B kinase (IKK; 600644 and 300248, respectively) to
associate with the upstream BCL10 (603517)-MALT1 (604860) adaptor
complex. Recruitment of the IKK-alpha,beta complex, its activation, and
the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa-B require enzyme activity of
full-length caspase-8. Su et al. (2005) concluded that their findings
explained the paradoxical association of defective apoptosis and
combined immunodeficiency in human caspase-8 deficiency.

Stupack et al. (2006) showed that suppression of caspase-8 expression
occurs during the establishment of neuroblastoma (256700) metastases in
vivo, and that reconstitution of caspase-8 expression in deficient
neuroblastoma cells suppressed their metastases. Caspase-8 status was
not a predictor of primary tumor growth; rather, caspase-8 selectively
potentiated apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells invading the collagenous
stroma at the tumor margin. Apoptosis was initiated by unligated
integrins (see 605025) by means of a process known as integrin-mediated
death. Loss of caspase-8 or integrin rendered the cells refractory to
integrin-mediated death, allowed cellular survival in the stromal
microenvironment, and promoted metastases. Stupack et al. (2006)
concluded that these findings define caspase-8 as a metastasis
suppressor gene that, together with integrins, regulates the survival
and invasive capacity of neuroblastoma cells.

Oberst et al. (2011) showed that development of caspase-8-deficient mice
is completely rescued by ablation of receptor-interacting protein
kinase-3 (RIPK3; 605817). Adult animals lacking both caspase-8 and Ripk3
displayed a progressive lymphoaccumulative disease resembling that seen
with defects in Cd95 (FAS; 134637) or Cd95 ligand (FASL; 134638), and
resisted the lethal effects of Cd95 ligation in vivo. Oberst et al.
(2011) found that caspase-8 prevents RIPK3-dependent necrosis without
inducing apoptosis by functioning in a proteolytically active complex
with CFLAR (603599) and that this complex is required for the protective
function.

Kaiser et al. (2011) found that Ripk3 is responsible for the
midgestational death of Casp8-deficient embryos. Remarkably,
Casp8-null/Rip3-null-double mutant mice were viable and matured into
fertile adults with a full immune complement of myeloid and lymphoid
cell types. These mice seemed immunocompetent but developed
lymphadenopathy by 4 months of age marked by accumulation of abnormal T
cells in the periphery, a phenotype reminiscent of mice with Fas
deficiency. Thus, Kaiser et al. (2011) concluded that Casp8 contributes
to homeostatic control in the adult immune system; however, RIPK3 and
CASP8 are together completely dispensable for mammalian development.

Burguillos et al. (2011) showed that the orderly activation of caspase-8
and caspase-3/7 (600636/601761), known executioners of apoptotic cell
death, regulate microglia activation through a protein kinase C-delta
(PPKCD; 176977)-dependent pathway. Burguillos et al. (2011) found that
stimulation of microglia with various inflammogens activates caspase-8
and caspase-3/7 in microglia without triggering cell death in vitro and
in vivo. Knockdown or chemical inhibition of each of these caspases
hindered microglia activation and consequently reduced neurotoxicity.
The authors observed that these caspases are activated in microglia in
the ventral mesencephalon of Parkinson disease (168600) and the frontal
cortex of individuals with Alzheimer disease (104300). Burguillos et al.
(2011) concluded that caspase-8 and caspase-3/7 are involved in
regulating microglia activation, and suggested that inhibition of these
caspases could be neuroprotective by targeting the microglia rather than
the neurons themselves.

Gunther et al. (2011) demonstrated a critical role for caspase-8 in
regulating necroptosis of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and
terminal ileitis. Mice with a conditional deletion of caspase-8 in the
intestinal epithelium (Casp8-delta-IEC) spontaneously developed
inflammatory lesions in the terminal ileum were highly susceptible to
colitis. These mice lacked Paneth cells and showed reduced numbers of
goblet cells, indicating dysregulated antimicrobial immune cell
functions of the intestinal epithelium. Casp8-delta-IEC mice showed
increased cell death in the Paneth cell area of small intestinal crypts.
Epithelial cell death was induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA;
191160), was associated with increased expression of
receptor-interacting protein-3 (RIP3; 605817) and could be inhibited on
blockade of necroptosis. Lastly, Gunther et al. (2011) identified high
levels of RIP3 in human Paneth cells and increased necroptosis in the
terminal ileum of patients with Crohn disease, suggesting a potential
role of necroptosis in the pathogenesis of this disease. Gunther et al.
(2011) concluded that their data demonstrated a critical function of
caspase-8 in regulating intestinal homeostasis and in protecting IECs
from TNFA-induced necroptotic cell death.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Varfolomeev et al. (1998) determined that
the CASP8 gene contains 8 exons. Hadano et al. (2001) determined that
the CASP8 gene contains 13 exons and spans 51.2 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Kischkel et al. (1998)
mapped the CASP8 gene to human chromosome 2q33-q34 and mouse chromosome
1B-proximal C. This mapping further extended the known homology of
synteny between these regions of human chromosome 2 and mouse chromosome
1. By FISH, Grenet et al. (1999) also mapped the CASP8 gene to 2q33-q34.
They noted that CASP10 (601762), whose product is closely related to
that of CASP8, has been mapped to the same location, indicating that the
2 genes have evolved by tandem duplication.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Liu et al. (2002) identified a naturally occurring deletion of leu62
within the first DED of CASP8 in A431 human vulva squamous carcinoma
cells. This deletion resulted in defective CASP8-dependent apoptosis.
Unlike wildtype CASP8, CASP8 lacking leu62 failed to form oligomers with
wildtype CASP8 and failed to interact with FADD. The mutation did not
effect proteolytic activation by granzyme B, nor did it effect catalytic
activity against PARP.

In 2 affected sibs from a consanguineous family with caspase-8
deficiency (607271), Chun et al. (2002) identified a homozygous mutation
in the CASP8 gene (601763.0001). The patients had defects in the
activation of T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, which led to
immunodeficiency.

Soung et al. (2005) analyzed the entire coding region of the CASP8 gene
in 69 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC; 114550), 2 with low-grade
dysplastic nodule (LGDN), 2 with high-grade dysplastic nodule (HGDN),
and 65 without dysplastic nodules, and detected a total of 9 somatic
mutations (13%). All 9 mutations were an identical 2-bp deletion
(nucleotides 1225-1226; 601763.0002), which was predicted to result in
frameshift and premature termination of amino acid synthesis in the p10
protease subunit. The change was detected both in HCC and in LGDN
lesions, suggesting that CASP8 mutation may be involved in the early
stage of HCC carcinogenesis. Soung et al. (2005) found that expression
of the tumor-derived caspase-8 mutant in cells abolished cell death
activity of caspase-8.

Cox et al. (2007) reported the findings of the Breast Cancer Association
Consortium (BCAC), which had been established to conduct combined
case-control analyses with augmented statistical power to try to confirm
putative genetic associations with breast cancer. They genotyped 9 SNPs
for which there was some prior evidence of an association with breast
cancer (114480). They included data from 9 to 15 studies, comprising
11,391 to 18,290 cases and 14,753 to 22,670 controls. They found
evidence of a protective association with breast cancer for a D302H
polymorphism in CASP8 (601763.0003), and weaker evidence for an L10P SNP
in the TGFB1 gene (190180.0007). These results demonstrated that common
breast cancer susceptibility alleles with small effects on risk can be
identified, given sufficiently powerful studies.

Caspases are important in the life and death of immune cells and
therefore influence immune surveillance of malignancies. Sun et al.
(2007) tested whether genetic variants in CASP8, CASP10, (601762), and
CFLAR (603599), 3 genes important for death receptor-induced cell
killing residing in tandem order on chromosome 2q33, are associated with
cancer susceptibility. Using a haplotype-tagging SNP approach, they
identified a 6-nucleotide deletion (-652 6N del) variant in the CASP8
promoter (601763.0004) associated with decreased risk of lung cancer.
The deletion destroyed a binding site for stimulatory protein-1 (SP1;
189906) and decreased transcription. Biochemical analyses showed that T
lymphocytes with the deletion variant had lower caspase-8 activity and
activation-induced cell death upon stimulation with cancer cell
antigens. Case-control analyses of 4,995 individuals with cancer and
4,972 controls in a Chinese population showed that this genetic variant
is associated with reduced susceptibility to multiple cancers, including
lung, esophageal, gastric, colorectal, cervical, and breast cancers,
acting in an allele dose-dependent manner. The results supported the
hypothesis that genetic variants influencing immune status modify cancer
susceptibility. Haiman et al. (2008) did not find an association between
this SNP and breast (114480), colorectal (114500), or prostate (176807)
cancer among 2,098, 1,139, and 2,825 patients, respectively. The study
included patients in Hawaii and California of various ethnic groups.

ANIMAL MODEL

Varfolomeev et al. (1998) generated mice deficient in Casp8 by
disrupting exons 1 and 2, which encode the N-terminal death effector
domains (DEDs) that interact with MORT1/FADD. Whereas wildtype and
heterozygous mice appeared normal, no homozygous mutant mice survived
beyond approximately embryonic day 13.5. Histopathologic analysis
revealed marked abdominal hyperemia with erythrocytosis in the liver,
major blood vessels, capillaries, and other organs. Cardiac ventricular
musculature was thin and similar to early mesenchyme. Colony forming
assays showed that hemopoietic precursor cells were markedly reduced in
the mutant mice. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis indicated
that fibroblasts from mutant mice responded normally to the noncytocidal
effects of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR; 191190) and death
receptor-3 (DR3, or TNFRSF12; 603366) stimulation, whereas wildtype
fibroblasts were killed by TNF (191160) treatment or FAS cross-linking.
Agents such as ultraviolet irradiation and protein kinase inhibitors
were lethal for mutant and normal fibroblasts. Varfolomeev et al. (1998)
concluded that CASP8 is necessary for death induction by receptors of
the TNF/nerve growth factor (see NGFR; 162010) family and is vital in
embryonal development.

Zender et al. (2003) evaluated the efficacy of small interfering RNA
(siRNA) in vivo in different mouse models with acute liver failure. They
directed 21-nucleotide siRNAs against caspase-8, which is a key enzyme
in death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Systemic administration of
caspase-8 siRNA resulted in inhibition of caspase-8 gene expression in
the liver, therefore preventing CD95-mediated apoptosis. Protection of
hepatocytes by caspase-8 siRNA significantly attenuated acute liver
damage induced by CD95 antibody or by adenovirus expressing FAS ligand.
In a clinical situation, siRNAs would most likely be administered after
the onset of acute liver failure. Therefore, Zender et al. (2003)
injected caspase-8 siRNA at a time during experimentally-induced liver
failure with already elevated liver transaminases. Improvement of
survival due to RNA interference was significant even when caspase-8
siRNA was applied during ongoing acute liver failure.

Salmena and Hakem (2005) used the Cre/lox recombinase system to generate
mice lacking Casp8 only in T cells (Tcasp8 -/- mice). Tcasp8 -/- mice
developed an age-dependent lethal lymphoproliferative and
lymphoinfiltrative immune disorder characterized by lymphoadenopathy,
splenomegaly, and T-cell infiltrates in lung, liver, and kidney.
Although there was lymphopenia in young Tcasp8 -/- mice, peripheral T
cells in old Tcasp8 -/- mice proliferated in the absence of infection or
stimulation. Salmena and Hakem (2005) proposed that Tcasp8 -/- mice may
serve as a model of human CASP8 deficiency and that CASP8 in T cells is
required for lymphocyte homeostasis.

To define the contribution of reduced caspase-8 to a wound healing
response, Lee et al. (2009) generated an epidermal knockout of
caspase-8. By postnatal day 10 the conditional knockout mouse had flaky
skin throughout its body, was slightly runted, and its epidermis was
dramatically thickened. Lee et al. (2009) found that even though
caspase-8 is normally expressed in the granular layer, it was the basal
and spinous layers that were markedly expanded in the knockout
epidermis. Lee et al. (2009) demonstrated that the loss of epidermal
caspase-8, an important mediator of apoptosis, recapitulated several
phases of a wound healing response in the mouse. The epidermal
hyperplasia in the caspase-8 null skin is the culmination of signals
exchanged between epidermal keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and
leukocytic cells. This reciprocal interaction is initiated by the
paracrine signaling of interleukin 1-alpha (IL1-alpha; 147760), which
activates both skin stem cell proliferation and cutaneous inflammation.
The noncanonical secretion of IL1-alpha is induced by a p38-MAPK
(600289)-mediated upregulation of NALP3 (606416), leading to
inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation. Notably, the increased
proliferation of basal keratinocytes is counterbalanced by the growth
arrest of suprabasal keratinocytes in the stratified epidermis by
IL1-alpha-dependent NF-kappa-B (see 164011) signaling. Lee et al. (2009)
concluded that their findings illustrated how the loss of caspase-8 can
affect more than programmed cell death to alter the local
microenvironment and elicit processes common to wound repair and many
neoplastic skin disorders.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CASPASE 8 DEFICIENCY
CASP8, ARG248TRP

In 2 affected sibs from a consanguineous family with caspase-8
deficiency (607271), Chun et al. (2002) identified a homozygous C-to-T
transition in the CASP8 gene, resulting in an arg248-to-trp (R248W)
substitution within the p18 protease subunit of the protein. The
asymptomatic mother, father, and sister were heterozygous carriers of
the mutation. In 13 extended family members, Chun et al. (2002)
identified 7 asymptomatic heterozygous carriers but found no additional
homozygous or immunodeficient individuals.

.0002
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, SOMATIC
CASP8, 2-BP DEL, 1225TG

In 9 unrelated patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (114550) and HBV
infection, Soung et al. (2005) identified the same somatic mutation, a
2-bp deletion (1225_1226delTG) in exon 7 that was predicted to result in
frameshift and premature termination of amino acid synthesis in the p10
protease subunit.

.0003
BREAST CANCER, PROTECTION AGAINST
CASP8, ASP302HIS

MacPherson et al. (2004) and Frank et al. (2005) found evidence that the
presence of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CASP8 gene
resulting in an asp302-to-his (D302H) substitution (dbSNP rs1045485)
could reduce susceptibility to breast cancer (114480) in British and
German cohorts, respectively. Cox et al. (2007) found evidence for a
protective effect of the D302H polymorphism in an allele dose-dependent
manner in 16,423 cases and 17,109 controls from 14 studies that
contributed data to the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). The
study achieved odds ratios of 0.89 and 0.74 for heterozygotes and rare
homozygotes, respectively, compared with common homozygotes. This site
was not found to be polymorphic in Korean, Han Chinese, or Japanese
women. Cox et al. (2007) noted that the functional consequences of the
aspartic acid-to-histidine substitution were not known, and further
experiments were required to establish whether D302H itself or another
variant in strong linkage disequilibrium with it is causative.

.0004
LUNG CANCER, PROTECTION AGAINST
CASP8, 6-BP DEL, NT-652

Sun et al. (2007) identified a 6-nucleotide insertion/deletion
polymorphism in the CASP8 promoter, -652 AGTAAG ins/del (dbSNP
rs3834129), the deletion variant of which was associated with decreased
risk of developing lung cancer (211980) in a population of Han Chinese
subjects. The -652 6N deletion was also associated with decreased risk
of cancer of various other forms including esophageal, gastric,
colorectal, cervical, and breast, acting in an allele dose-dependent
manner. The frequency of the -652 6N deletion was significantly lower in
individuals with lung cancer (P = 4.1 x 10(-5)).

Haiman et al. (2008) did not find an association between this SNP and
breast (114480), colorectal (114500), or prostate (176807) cancer among
2,098, 1,139, and 2,825 patients, respectively. The study included
patients in Hawaii and California of various ethnic groups.

610925	TITLE *610925 INTERLEUKIN 17 RECEPTOR C; IL17RC
;;INTERLEUKIN 17 RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN; IL17RL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IL17RC is widely expressed in nonleukocyte tissues and forms a
heteromeric receptor for IL17 (603149) with IL17R (IL17RA; 605461)
(Haudenschild et al., 2002; Toy et al., 2006).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences with homology to IL17R,
Haudenschild et al. (2002) identified IL17RC, which they termed IL17RL.
The predicted full-length 720-amino acid protein has an N-terminal
signal peptide, followed by an acidic extracellular domain with 9
potential N-glycosylation sites, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and
a basic cytoplasmic region with multiple phosphorylation sites. It has a
calculated molecular mass of 76.4 kD and shares 22% amino acid identity
with IL17R. By database analysis, Haudenschild et al. (2002) identified
numerous IL17RL splice variants with the potential to produce at least
12 protein isoforms, including both transmembrane receptors and soluble
decoy receptors. Northern blot analysis detected strongest expression in
prostate, kidney, liver, heart, and muscle, with barely detectable
levels in thymus and peripheral blood leukocytes. The major transcript
was 2.5 kb, and diffuse bands between 2.1 and 3.1 kb were also detected.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated frequent absence of exon 7,
possibly in a tissue-specific manner. Immunoblot analysis showed
multiple bands of 33 to 60 kD, suggesting the presence of numerous
IL17RL isoforms. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated expression in
skeletal muscle, prostate, kidney, and placenta. Prostate cancers showed
decreased reactivity in epithelial cells and increased reactivity in
stromal regions relative to normal prostate.

GENE FUNCTION

Using flow cytometric, ELISA, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot
analyses, Toy et al. (2006) showed that expression of both human IL17RA
and IL17RC on Il17ra-deficient mouse fibroblasts was necessary for
either human IL17 or IL17F (606496) to fully bind cells and induce
secretion of CXCL1 (155730). Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed a
physical association between IL17RA and IL17RC. Toy et al. (2006)
concluded that the functional IL17R is a heteromeric complex consisting
of at least IL17RA and IL17RC.

GENE STRUCTURE

Haudenschild et al. (2002) determined that the IL17RC gene contains 19
exons and spans 16.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Haudenschild et al. (2002) mapped the
IL17RC gene to chromosome 3p25.3-p24.1.

606043	TITLE *606043 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 331; ZNF331
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 463; ZNF463;;
REARRANGED IN THYROID ADENOMAS; RITA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc finger proteins have been shown to interact with nucleic acids and
to have diverse functions. The zinc finger domain is a conserved amino
acid sequence motif containing 2 specifically positioned cysteines and 2
histidines that are involved in coordinating zinc. Kruppel-related
proteins form one family of zinc finger proteins. See ZFP93 (604749) for
additional information on zinc finger proteins.

CLONING

Using a differential display/PCR method, Wu et al. (2001) identified a
novel Kruppel-related zinc finger gene, which they designated ZNF463,
encoding a 463-amino acid protein with an N-terminal KRAB domain and 12
C-terminal C2H2 zinc finger units. Northern blot analysis revealed
testis-restricted expression of a 1.9-kb ZNF463 transcript. RT-PCR
analysis demonstrated higher expression of ZNF463 in normal fertile
adults than in fetuses or patients with azoospermia, suggesting that
ZNF463 may play a role in spermatogenesis.

MAPPING

By FISH, Wu et al. (2001) mapped the ZNF463 gene to chromosome
19q13.3-q13.4. This localization is consistent with the finding of the
ZNF331 gene in the region of 19q13 breakpoints involved in follicular
adenomas of the thyroid gland (Rippe et al., 1999).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Translocations involving 19q13 are a frequent finding in follicular
adenomas of the thyroid and may represent the most frequent type of
structural aberration in human epithelial tumors (Belge et al., 1998).
By positional cloning of the 19q13 breakpoints found in follicular
adenomas of the thyroid gland, Rippe et al. (1999) identified a
candidate gene that they initially referred to as RITA (rearranged in
thyroid adenomas) and renamed ZNF331. Meiboom et al. (2003) reported
unique expression of a 3.4-kb ZNF331 transcript in thyroid adenoma cell
lines with 19q13 aberrations which was not detected either in normal
tissues or in thyroid carcinoma cell lines.

611159	TITLE *611159 KERATIN 78; KRT78
;;KERATIN 5B; K5B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Keratins, such as KRT78, are filament proteins that make up one of the
major structural fibers of epithelial cells (Rogers et al., 2005).

CLONING

Using database analysis to identify keratin genes within the type II
keratin gene domain on chromosome 12, Rogers et al. (2005) identified
KRT78, which they called K5B. The deduced 520-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 56.8 kD. Like other type II keratins, K5B
has N- and C-terminal domains and a central rod domain consisting of 4
alpha-helical regions separated by 3 non-helical linker sequences.
Northern blot analysis detected expression of a 1.9-kb K5B transcript in
tongue, but not in skin or in any other tissues or organs examined.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rogers et al. (2005) mapped the KRT78 gene
to chromosome 12q13.13.

606672	TITLE *606672 GLYCOPROTEIN Ib, PLATELET, ALPHA POLYPEPTIDE; GP1BA
;;GP Ib, ALPHA SUBUNIT;;
PLATELET GLYCOPROTEIN Ib, ALPHA POLYPEPTIDE
GLYCOCALICIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glycoprotein Ib (GP Ib) is a platelet surface membrane glycoprotein that
functions as a receptor for von Willebrand factor (VWF; 613160). The
main portion of the receptor is a heterodimer composed of 2 polypeptide
chains, an alpha chain and a beta chain (GP1BB; 138720), that are linked
by disulfide bonds. The GP1BA gene encodes the alpha subunit. The
complete receptor complex includes noncovalent association of the alpha
and beta subunits with platelet glycoprotein IX (GP9; 173515) and
platelet glycoprotein V (GP5; 173511) (review by Lopez et al., 1998).

CLONING

The alpha subunit of GP Ib is susceptible to cleavage by trypsin or by
the calcium-dependent protease calpain, giving rise to a soluble heavily
glycosylated N-terminal fragment known as 'glycocalicin.' By screening a
human cDNA library with an antibody to glycocalicin, Lopez et al. (1987)
isolated a potential alpha subunit cDNA encoding a 610-amino acid
protein with a molecular mass of approximately 145 kD. The predicted
protein has an extracytoplasmic leucine-rich domain composed of a
24-amino acid motif that contains 7 conserved leucine positions. The
extracytoplasmic domain is followed by a 29-amino acid transmembrane
domain and a 100-amino acid intracellular domain at the carboxyl end of
the molecule. The GP1B beta subunit, GP9, and GP5 have similar
leucine-rich domains.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization using a genomic clone, Wenger et al. (1989)
demonstrated that the GP1BA gene is located on chromosome 17pter-p12.

GENE FUNCTION

The binding of platelet GP Ib to von Willebrand factor facilitates
initial platelet adhesion to vascular subendothelium after vascular
injury. The binding of VWF to the GP Ib complex also initiates signaling
events within the platelet that lead to enhanced platelet activation,
thrombosis, and hemostasis (Lopez et al., 1998). Michelson et al. (1986)
presented evidence that a portion of the oligosaccharide chains on
glycocalicin contributes to the VWF binding activity of GP Ib. Harmon
and Jamieson (1986) found that GP Ib was a receptor for thrombin
(176930), and that glycocalicin was the site of thrombin binding.
Michelson et al. (1988) showed that there is a large intraplatelet pool
of GP Ib.

Andrews and Fox (1992) noted that the GP Ib complex is a major site of
attachment of the platelet membrane skeleton to the plasma membrane,
mediated by the interaction of actin-binding protein with the receptor
complex. They showed that a region between thr536 and phe568 of the
cytoplasmic domain of the alpha subunit participates in the interaction.

Steinberg et al. (1987) measured plasma concentration of glycocalicin,
as an aid to classification of thrombocytopenia; values were low in
situations of bone marrow suppression and normal or elevated when there
was accelerated platelet turnover. Beer et al. (1994) also suggested
that glycocalicin is a useful platelet marker in certain diseases.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Huizinga et al. (2002) presented the crystal structure of the GP1BA
amino-terminal domain and its complex with the VWF (613160) domain A1.
In the complex, GP1BA wraps around one side of A1, providing 2 contact
areas bridged by an area of solvated charge interaction. The structures
explain the effects of gain-of-function mutations related to bleeding
disorders and provide a model for shear-induced activation.

Celikel et al. (2003) determined that the structure of platelet GP1BA
bound to thrombin at 2.3 angstrom resolution and defined 2 sites that
bind to exosite II and exosite I of 2 distinct alpha-thrombin molecules,
respectively. GP1BA occupancy may be sequential, as the site binding to
alpha-thrombin exosite I appears to be cryptic in the unoccupied
receptor but exposed when a first thrombin molecule is bound through
exosite II. Celikel et al. (2003) suggested that these interactions may
modulate alpha-thrombin function by mediating GP1BA clustering and
cleavage of protease-activator receptors, which promote platelet
activation, while limiting fibrinogen clotting through blockade of
exosite I.

Dumas et al. (2003) independently determined the crystal structure of
the GP1BA-thrombin complex at 2.6 angstrom resolution. They found that
in the crystal lattice, the periodic arrangement of GP1BA-thrombin
complexes mirrors a scaffold that could serve as a driving force for
tight platelet adhesion.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Polymorphisms

By SDS-PAGE, Moroi et al. (1984) studied GP Ib from 131 Japanese
subjects and identified 4 slightly different species of GP Ib
corresponding to different molecular masses (see also 606672.0002). On
the assumption of a 4-allele system, the gene frequencies calculated
were: A, 0.073; B, 0.011; C, 0.561; and D, 0.355. Platelets of different
GP Ib phenotypes showed the same functional properties. Furthermore, no
individual had more than 2 types; the relative amounts of the 2 bands on
SDS-PAGE were about equal in each person; the phenotype was constant on
multiple testings and the phenotypes of children were consistent with
those of their parents: e.g., the parents of a person with the rare
phenotype BC were CC and BD.

Polymorphisms described in the GP1BA gene include the Kozak T/C
polymorphism at position -5, the variable number of tandem repeats
(VNTR; 606672.0002), and the thr145-to-met polymorphism.

The platelet-specific alloantigen Sib(a), located within the GP Ib alpha
subunit, is involved in the pathogenesis of platelet transfusion
refractoriness. Murata et al. (1992) identified a threonine/methionine
dimorphism at position 145 of the GP Ib-alpha sequence and determined
that the Sib(a) antigen corresponds to the molecule containing
methionine-145. The diallelic codons were detected by restriction enzyme
analysis of amplified genomic DNA fragments from the GP1BA gene. Among
61 healthy blood donors, the allele frequencies were 89% and 11% for the
threonine-145 and methionine-145 codons, respectively. A positive
correlation existed between platelet reactivity with the anti-Sib(a)
antibody and the presence of a methionine-145 encoding allele. The
findings provide methods useful in transfusion medicine to match donor
and recipient platelets. Baker et al. (2001) referred to the thr145
polymorphism as human platelet antigen-2a (HPA-2a) and met145 as HPA-2b.

T/C polymorphism at the -5 position from the initiator ATG codon of the
GP1BA gene was first reported by Kaski et al. (1996) and is located
within the 'Kozak' consensus nucleotide sequence. The presence of a
cytosine (C) at this position significantly increases the surface
expression of the GP Ib/V/IX complex (Afshar-Kharghan et al., 1999).
This result prompted Ishida et al. (2000) to examine the presence of
Kozak sequence polymorphism of GP1BA in Asian populations and to
determine whether this polymorphism has a role in coronary artery
disease. The frequency of cytosine was 0.283 and 0.219 in Japanese and
Korean populations, respectively. The C allele is linked with human
platelet antigen-2a and smaller types of variable number of tandem
repeats (VNTR). No association was observed between these alleles and
coronary artery disease in a case-control study.

Baker et al. (2001) noted that platelets are pivotal to the process of
arterial thrombosis resulting in ischemic stroke and that thrombosis is
initiated by the interaction of VWF and GP Ib. They studied whether
GP1BA polymorphisms are candidate genes for first-ever ischemic stroke.
The frequency (22.8%) of T/C heterozygotes in the Caucasian Australian
population studied was similar to that in other populations. The
heterozygous genotype was elevated in the stroke group (32.2%) and the
increased relative risk was still apparent after adjusting for
conventional cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes,
hyperlipidemia, smoking, and previous vascular events. CC homozygotes
were uncommon and the study was not powered to examine the role of the
CC genotype alone. The authors hypothesized that the Kozak polymorphism
influences the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke because the C allele
increases the level of platelet glycoprotein GP Ib-alpha on the platelet
surface.

- Disease-causing Mutations

In a patient with autosomal recessive Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSSA1;
231200), Ware et al. (1990) identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in
the GP1BA gene (606672.0001).

In a Caucasian family in which 5 members over 2 generations were
affected with an autosomal dominant form of Bernard-Soulier syndrome
(BSSA2; 153670), Miller et al. (1992) identified a heterozygous mutation
in the GP1BA gene (606672.0004).

Platelet-type von Willebrand disease (177820), also known as pseudo-von
Willebrand disease, is an autosomal dominant bleeding disorder
characterized by abnormally enhanced binding of von Willebrand factor by
patients' platelets. In 7 affected members of a family with pseudo-VWD,
Miller et al. (1991) identified a heterozygous mutation in the GP1BA
gene (606672.0003).

ANIMAL MODEL

Bergmeier et al. (2006) generated mice expressing Gp1ba in which the
extracellular domain was replaced by that of the human IL4 receptor
(IL4R; 147781). Platelet adhesion to ferric chloride-treated mesenteric
arteries was virtually absent in transgenic mice compared to avid
adhesion in wildtype mice, and resulted in complete inhibition of
arterial thrombus formation. When infused into wildtype mice, transgenic
IL4R/Gp1ba platelets or wildtype platelets lacking the 45-kD N-terminal
domain of Gp1ba failed to incorporate into growing arterial thrombi,
even if the platelets were activated before infusion. Bergmeier et al.
(2006) concluded that GP1BA is required for recruitment of platelets to
both exposed subendothelium and thrombi under arterial flow conditions
and that it contributes to arterial thrombosis by adhesion mechanisms
independent of binding to VWF.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BERNARD-SOULIER SYNDROME, TYPE A1
GP1BA, TRP343TER

In a patient with Bernard-Soulier syndrome (231200), Ware et al. (1990)
identified a nonsense mutation in the GP1BA gene (W343X). Immunoblotting
of the patient's solubilized platelets demonstrated absence of normal GP
Ib-alpha but presence of a smaller immunoreactive species. The authors
hypothesized that the truncated polypeptide could not be properly
inserted into the platelet membrane. The truncated polypeptide was also
present, along with normal protein, in platelets from the patient's
mother and 2 of his 4 children.

NONARTERITIC ANTERIOR ISCHEMIC OPTIC NEUROPATHY, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO,
INCLUDED
GP1BA, 92-BP DUP, SER399-THR411 DUP, VARIABLE REPEATS

Moroi et al. (1984) described 4 polymorphic variants of platelet von
Willebrand factor receptor. Meyer and Schellenberg (1990) showed that
the polymorphism is due to size differences in the heavily glycosylated
macroglycopeptide region of the alpha chain of GP Ib. Because this
region of the alpha subunit contains tandemly repeated sequences (Lopez
et al., 1987), Lopez and Ludwig (1991) amplified genomic DNA
corresponding to this region from 120 persons of diverse ethnic origins.
They found in the group 3 alleles of different sizes which varied in the
number of repeats of a 39-bp sequence that led to perfect duplication of
the 13-amino acid sequence, ser399 to thr411 (numbering based on
published sequence). The smallest isoform contained 1 such sequence, the
next larger 2 repeats, and the largest 3 repeats. The repeat sequence
contains 5 sites for potential O-glycosylation, which together with the
repeated amino acids would result in incremental differences in
molecular weight of approximately 6,000 between the different isoforms.
Differences in the number of repeats were predicted to change the length
of the elongated glycosylated region and to change the distance between
the amino-terminal ligand-binding domain and the plasma membrane, an
effect that might have a subtle bearing on the binding of VWF or on the
sensitivity of this interaction to shear forces.

Salomon et al. (2004) reported that the presence of the VNTR B allele of
GP1BA confers a significant risk for nonarteritic anterior ischemic
optic neuropathy (NAION; 258660), with an odds ratio of 4.25 (95% CI
1.67-10.82, P = 0.013). Nine of 16 patients who bore the VNTR B allele
(56.3%) had second eye involvement, whereas only 17 of 72 patients
(23.6%) without the allele had second eye involvement (P = 0.009),
indicating that the presence of the VNTR B allele may predispose
affected patients to second eye involvement.

.0003
VON WILLEBRAND DISEASE, PLATELET-TYPE
GP1BA, GLY233VAL

Platelet-type von Willebrand disease (177820), also known as pseudo-von
Willebrand disease, is an autosomal dominant bleeding disorder
characterized by abnormally enhanced binding of von Willebrand factor by
patients' platelets. In 7 affected members of a family with pseudo-VWD,
Miller et al. (1991) identified a heterozygous mutation in the GP1BA
gene resulting in the substitution of gly233-to-val (G233V). The
mutation was absent in 6 unaffected family members. To evaluate the
functional consequences of the G233V mutation, Murata et al. (1993)
constructed a recombinant analog of the alpha subunit of GP Ib
containing val233. The recombinant fragment with the val233 substitution
reproduced the functional abnormality of the GP Ib-IX complex in
platelet-type von Willebrand disease.

.0004
BERNARD-SOULIER SYNDROME, TYPE A2, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
GP1BA, LEU57PHE

In a Caucasian family in which 5 members over 2 generations were
affected with an autosomal dominant form of Bernard-Soulier syndrome
(153670), Miller et al. (1992) identified a heterozygous leu57-to-phe
(L57F) substitution within the highly conserved GP Ib-alpha leucine
tandem repeat that segregated with the disease. The proband was a
13-year-old male who was referred for evaluation of thrombocytopenia
which had been noted before dental extractions. He had frequent episodes
of epistaxis, one of which was severe enough to require hospitalization.
The mother had a long history of bleeding problems as did the other
affected family members except for one who had 'an essentially negative
bleeding history.' The affected individual showed increased mean
platelet volume.

.0005
VON WILLEBRAND DISEASE, PLATELET-TYPE
GP1BA, MET239VAL

In a father and 2 daughters with pseudo-von Willebrand disease (177820),
Russell and Roth (1993) demonstrated an A-to-G transition in codon 239
that resulted in substitution of valine for methionine (M239V). The
abnormal receptor displayed increased affinity for its ligand, von
Willebrand factor.

.0006
BERNARD-SOULIER SYNDROME, TYPE A1
BERNARD-SOULIER SYNDROME, TYPE A2, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, INCLUDED
GP1BA, ALA156VAL

In a patient with Bernard-Soulier syndrome (231200), Ware et al. (1993)
identified a homozygous ala156-to-val substitution (A156V) in the GP Ib
alpha protein. This mutation is situated in a leucine-rich repeat of the
protein and is associated with a loss of binding with the von Willebrand
factor.

In 6 Italian families with autosomal dominant inheritance of mild
bleeding symptoms, including petechiae, epistaxis, and mucosal bleeding,
Savoia et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous A156V substitution in the
GP1BA gene. The findings were consistent with autosomal dominant
Bernard-Soulier syndrome (153670). The 6 probands with the A156V
mutation and 2 others were found to have a reduction of platelet
membrane glycoproteins comparable to that found in a BSS heterozygous
condition.

.0007
BERNARD-SOULIER SYNDROME, TYPE A1
GP1BA, TRP498TER

In a 73-year-old male with Bernard-Soulier syndrome (231200) and
life-long bleeding problems, Holmberg et al. (1997) found a homozygous
trp498-to-ter mutation in the GP1BA gene, resulting in a truncated
polypeptide chain. In contrast to previously reported truncated forms,
this one contained a portion of the transmembranous domain as well as
the juxtamembranous cysteines engaged in a disulfide bond with the
beta-polypeptide. The patient had suffered subdural hematomas and severe
episodes of gastric hemorrhage. Thrombocytopenia had been diagnosed in
childhood. The patient's parents had common ancestors in the late
seventeenth century. The diagnosis of Bernard-Soulier syndrome was based
on thrombocytopenia with giant platelets, absent ristocetin aggregation,
and no detectable GP Ib on the platelets with an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (Waldenstrom et al., 1991).

.0008
BERNARD-SOULIER SYNDROME, TYPE A1
GP1BA, TRP126TER

Noda et al. (1995) and Iwanaga et al. (1998) identified a trp126-to-ter
nonsense mutation in 3 unrelated Japanese patients with BSS (231200).
Although these seemingly unrelated patients lived in the same geographic
area in the vicinity of Kyushu, Japan, haplotype analysis suggested that
any founder effect must have been very ancient. The mutation was not
identified in 100 normal volunteers from the same area.

611990	TITLE *611990 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S28; MRPS28
;;MRPS35
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPS28 is 1 of more
than 70 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes that are encoded
by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, O'Brien et al. (2000) and
Koc et al. (2001) independently identified full-length human MRPS28.
O'Brien et al. (2000) determined that the MRPS28 protein contains 188
amino acids. Koc et al. (2001) determined that the MRPS28 protein, which
they designated MRPS35, contains 187 amino acids and has a calculated
molecular mass of 20.8 kD. Removal of a predicted 28-amino acid
N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal results in a mature 17.6-kD
protein. O'Brien et al. (2000) and Koc et al. (2001) identified MRPS28
orthologs in mouse, rat, Drosophila, and C. elegans, but not in yeast or
E. coli. Koc et al. (2001) reported that mouse and human MRPS28 share
72.5% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS map,
Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRPS28 gene to chromosome
8q21.1-q21.2.

614471	TITLE *614471 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 19; USP19
;;KIAA0891
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

USP19 is a ubiquitin protein ligase (EC 3.4.19.12) with a role in
regulating cell cycle progression (Lu et al., 2009).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned USP19, which they designated
KIAA0891. The deduced 1,371-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with the ubiquitin protease UNPH (USP4; 603486). RT-PCR ELISA
detected highest expression in fetal liver, followed by adult spinal
cord. All other tissues, including adult and fetal brain, showed much
lower expression, and no expression was detected in spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

p27(KIP1) (CDKN1B; 600778) is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that
regulates the G1/S transition. Using rat myoblast and fibroblast cell
lines, Lu et al. (2009) showed that Usp19 regulated p27(KIP1) levels by
deubiquitinating and stabilizing Kpc1 (RNF123; 614472), an E3 ubiquitin
ligase that ubiquitinates cytosolic p27(KIP1) and targets it for
proteasomal degradation at G1 phase. Immunoprecipitation analysis
revealed that Usp19 interacted directly with Kpc1. Knockdown of Usp19
resulted in loss of Kpc1, accumulation of p27(KIP1), inhibition of cell
proliferation, and slower progression from G0/G1 to S phase.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the USP19 gene
to chromosome 3.

Hartz (2011) mapped the USP19 gene to chromosome 3p21.31 based on an
alignment of the USP19 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB020698) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;STROMELYSIN 1 PDGF-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN; SPBP;;
SPRE-BINDING PROTEIN;  AR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Sanz et al. (1995) screened a mouse fibroblast expression library to
identify factors that bind to a 19-nucleotide promoter element called
the SPRE (stromelysin-1 PDGF-responsive element), which controls
stromelysin-1 (185250) expression in response to mitogen stimulation.
They isolated a cDNA encoding a predicted 937-amino acid protein
designated SPBP for 'SPRE-binding protein.' SPBP contains several
features characteristic of transcription factors, including a putative
leucine zipper region, a nuclear localization signal, and a basic domain
similar to the DNA-binding domain found in the Fos (164810)-Jun (165160)
family of transcription factors. However, whereas in Fos and Jun the ZIP
and DNA-binding domains lie very close together, in SPBP they are widely
separated. Sanz et al. (1995) found that expression of SPBP in mammalian
cells activated transcription of a reporter gene construct containing
either the full-length stromelysin promoter or a single copy of the SPRE
inserted upstream of a heterologous promoter.

Rajadhyaksha et al. (1998) identified cDNAs encoding AR1, a human SPBP
homolog.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Rajadhyaksha et al. (1998) localized the AR1 gene to
22q13.3.

605320	TITLE *605320 6-@PHOSPHOFRUCTO-2-KINASE/FRUCTOSE-2,6-BISPHOSPHATASE 4; PFKFB4
;;PFKFB, TESTIS
DESCRIPTION The bifunctional 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (EC
2.7.1.105)/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.46) (PFKFB) regulates
the steady-state concentration of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a potent
activator of a key regulatory enzyme of glycolysis, phosphofructokinase.
Isozymes of PFKFB differ in the regions surrounding the catalytic core,
which are important for the differential response to allosteric
effectors and hormonal signals in different tissues.

By screening a placental cDNA library with human and frog liver PFKFB
(PFKFB1; 311790) as probes, Sakai et al. (1996) obtained a partial cDNA
encoding PFKFB4, which they termed 2K-1. Manzano et al. (1999) isolated
a cDNA encoding PFKFB4 by screening a human testis cDNA library with a
rat liver Pfkfb probe, followed by RT-PCR. The predicted 469-amino acid
PFKFB4 protein, which is 97% homologous to the rat sequence and
approximately 70% identical to the human PFKFB isoforms, contains
multiple phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis of rat brain,
heart, liver, muscle, placenta, adipose tissue, ovary, fallopian tubes,
and testis with the human PFKFB4 sequence as probe detected
testis-specific expression of 2.4- and 3.3-kb transcripts. Western blot
analysis showed expression of a 55-kD protein, close to the predicted
value.

Manzano et al. (1999) mapped the PFKFB4 gene to 3p22-p21 by FISH.

;;RAPID INDUCER OF G2/M PROGRESSION IN OOCYTES, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF,
C;;
RINGO C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SPDYC activates cyclin-dependent kinases (e.g., CDK2; 116953) and
positively regulates cell cycle progression during the late S and G2
phases (Cheng and Solomon, 2008).

CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to Xenopus Speedy/Ringo
(see SPDYA; 614029), followed by RT-PCR of placenta RNA, Cheng et al.
(2005) cloned SPDYC, which they called Speedy/Ringo C. The deduced
293-amino acid protein contains a highly conserved region of about 140
amino acids, which Cheng et al. (2005) called the Speedy/Ringo box.
Orthologs of SPDYC were detected in cow and pig, but not in mouse and
rat. RT-PCR detected SPDYC expression in human bone marrow, kidney,
small intestine, liver, placenta, and testis, but not in 14 other
tissues.

Using RT-PCR, Cheng and Solomon (2008) found that Speedy/Ringo C was
expressed in K562 erythroleukemia cells and HEK293 cells, but not in
A549 lung carcinoma cells or HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Cheng et al. (2005) found that recombinant human SPDYC bound and
activated CDC2 (CDK1; 116940) and CDK2 in vitro and in transfected
HEK293 cells.

Cheng and Solomon (2008) showed that downregulation of SPDYC via RNA
interference in HEK293 cells inhibited cell growth, reduced the fraction
of cells in G1, and increased the fraction of cells in S and G2.
Conversely, ectopic expression of SPDYC caused cell cycle arrest at the
G1-to-S transition, elevated levels of p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) and p27
(CDKN1B; 600778), increased cell death, and decreased the fraction of
cells in S and G2/M. Consistent with its role as a CDK activator, FACS
analysis indicated that overexpression of SPDYC accelerated late S phase
progression and disrupted the G2 DNA damage checkpoint. Cheng and
Solomon (2008) concluded that, in contrast with SPDYA, which functions
during the G1/S transition and S phase progression, SPDYC regulates S
and G2 phase progression and may trigger mitotic entry.

Mouron et al. (2010) found that knockdown of Ringo C in U2OS human
osteosarcoma cells resulted in premature mitotic exit and misaligned
chromosomes. Ringo C-depleted cells showed checkpoint defects, resulting
in chromosome missegregation and an increased number of micronuclei and
binucleated structures. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that Ringo C was
involved in the spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC). Depletion of Ringo C
resulted in impaired recruitment of the SAC components MAD2 (MAD2L1;
601467), BUB1 (602452), and BUBR1 (BUB1B; 602860) and triggered
premature activation of anaphase-promoting complex (see 608473)-mediated
degradation of cyclin B (CCNB1; 123836). Ringo C associated with the
mitotic kinase Aurora B (AURKB; 604970) via a domain separate from its
CDK-binding domain. Downregulation of Ringo C produced mislocalization
of the active form of Aurora B in prometaphase. Mouron et al. (2010)
concluded that Ringo C has a role in mitotic checkpoint, recruitment of
SAC components, and proper localization of Aurora kinase B.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the SPDYC gene to chromosome 11q13.1 based on an
alignment of the SPDYC sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY820305) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

613357	TITLE *613357 FIBRINOGEN C DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; FIBCD1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FIBCD1 is a conserved type II transmembrane endocytic receptor that
binds chitin and is located primarily in the intestinal brush border
(Schlosser et al., 2009).

CLONING

By searching databases for L-ficolin (FCN2; 601624) homologs that might
bind acetyl groups, Schlosser et al. (2009) identified human FIBCD1. The
predicted 461-amino acid protein has a 31-amino acid cytoplasmic tail at
its N terminus, followed by a 23-amino acid transmembrane helix and a
408-amino acid ectodomain. The cytoplasmic tail has 2 potential
phosphorylation sites. The ectodomain contains an acetyl group-binding
fibrinogen (see 134820)-related domain (FRED) and sequences with
homology to coiled-coil regions of myosins (see 601478) and
angiopoietins (see 601667). FIBCD1 shares significant homology with
FCN2, M-ficolin (FCN1; 601252), and horseshoe crab tachylectin-5A
(Tl5a). When expressed in HEK293 cells as a secreted protein, the FIBCD1
ectodomain had a molecular mass of 55 kD in the reduced state and 250 kD
in the unreduced state by SDS-PAGE, and chemical cross-linking
experiments showed that it formed disulfide-linked homotetramers. FACS
analysis and confocal microscopy of transfected Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) cells showed cell surface localization of full-length FIBCD1.
RT-PCR detected FIBCD1 mRNA in nearly all human tissues examined.
Immunohistochemical analysis of human tissues demonstrated high
expression of FIBCD1 in small and large intestine epithelial cells on
the apical surface corresponding to the brush border and in salivary
gland ducts. Little to no expression was detected in stomach epithelial
cells, respiratory cells, and urogenital epithelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using ELISA and fluorescence microscopy analysis, Schlosser et al.
(2009) showed that human FIBCD1 could bind to and mediate uptake of
acetylated bovine serum albumin (BSA) in a manner that depended on
calcium or manganese, but not magnesium. Pull-down analysis revealed
that FIBCD1 bound chitin, but not other pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs). Schlosser et al. (2009) concluded that FIBCD1 is a
membrane-bound FRED molecule that binds chitin.

By chemical cross-linking and electron microscopy analyses, Thomsen et
al. (2010) showed that FIBCD1 FREDs formed noncovalent tetramers
independent of the coiled-coil. Using surface plasmon resonance and
pull-down assays with mutation analysis, they found that the central
residues in the hydrophobic funnel were necessary for binding of FIBCD1
to acetylated BSA and chitin. Thomsen et al. (2010) concluded that
FIBCD1 FREDs form noncovalent tetramers with an acetyl-binding site
homologous to those of Tl5a and FCN1, but not to that of FCN2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schlosser et al. (2009) determined that the FIBCD1 gene contains 7 exons
and spans 36 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Schlosser et al. (2009) mapped the FIBCD1
gene to chromosome 9q34.12-q34.13.

;;ZINC TRANSPORTER 5; ZNT5;;
ZNT1-LIKE 1; ZTL1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cragg et al. (2002) identified an EST containing mouse Slc30a5, which
they designated Ztl1. Using this sequence to design primers, they cloned
human ZTL1 by 5-prime RACE of a small intestine cDNA library and by
RT-PCR of a CaCo2 (small intestine cell line) cDNA library. The deduced
523-amino acid protein contains 12 predicted membrane-spanning domains
with extracellular N and C termini. Between transmembrane domains 9 and
10, ZTL1 has a zinc-binding histidine-rich intracellular loop. ZTL1
shares 34% identity with ZNT1 (SLC30A1; 609521) over a 122-amino acid
stretch, and it shares significant homology with several rodent zinc
transporters. Northern blot analysis detected 2.0- and 5.0-kb
transcripts in CaCo2 cell line RNA. RT-PCR of mouse tissues detected
ubiquitous expression, with highest level in kidney and lowest level in
liver.

Using homology with an S. cerevisiae zinc transporter, Kambe et al.
(2002) identified ESTs containing mouse Znt5. Using the mouse ESTs, they
obtained a full-length human ZNT5 cDNA by a combination of rapid cDNA
PCR screening and primer extension technique. The deduced 765-amino acid
protein has 15 predicted membrane-spanning domains and a calculated
molecular mass of about 84 kD. Western blot analysis of the full-length
protein expressed in HeLa cells indicated an apparent molecular mass of
about 55 kD. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of 3-
and 4-kb transcripts, with highest expression in pancreas, followed by
kidney and liver. Immunohistochemical examination of pancreas showed
colocalization of ZNT5 with insulin (176730) in beta cells, and electron
microscopy revealed association of ZNT5 with secretory granule
membranes. ZNT5 expressed by transfected HeLa cells localized in Golgi
membranes.

GENE FUNCTION

By heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes, Cragg et al. (2002)
confirmed zinc transport by ZTL1. Zn(2+) uptake across oocyte membranes
was saturable and pH dependent.

Kambe et al. (2002) determined that ZNT5 expressed in HeLa cell Golgi
membranes mediated Zn(2+) transport. Transport was temperature- and
concentration-dependent and was saturable. Yeast expressing ZNT5 showed
poor growth in medium containing 10 mM zinc compared with control cells.
Transfected yeast cells also showed cobalt sensitivity, suggesting that
cobalt may be a ZNT5 substrate.

Using chicken B cells lacking Znt5, Znt6 (611148), and Znt7 (611149),
followed by reexpression of the human transgenes, Suzuki et al. (2005)
showed that ZNT5 and ZNT6 had to be coexpressed to transport zinc for
activation of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP, or ALPL;
171760) in the Golgi lumen, whereas ZNT7 acted alone to perform the same
function. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses showed
that ZNT5 and ZNT6 formed heterooligomers and that ZNT7 formed
homooligomers.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cragg et al. (2002) determined that the SLC30A5 gene contains 11 exons
and spans about 21 kb. The promoter region contains a putative TATA box
and a core consensus metal response element.

Seve et al. (2004) stated that the human SLC30A5 gene contains 15 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Cragg et al. (2002) mapped the SLC30A5
gene to chromosome 5. Seve et al. (2004) stated that the SLC30A5 gene
maps to chromosome 5q11.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Inoue et al. (2002) reported that mice deficient for SLC30A5 showed poor
growth and decreased bone density, due to impairment of osteoblast
maturation. More than 60% of male null mice died suddenly because of
bradyarrhythmias. Analysis of gene expression profiles in murine hearts
by means of an oligonucleotide microarray disclosed that a subset of
genes encoding immediate-early response factors (IEGs) and heat shock
proteins (HSPs) were downregulated in Znt5-null mice. The authors
concluded that SLC30A5 plays an important role in maturation of
osteoblasts and in maintenance of the cells involved in the cardiac
conduction system, perhaps through regulating expression of IEGs and
HSPs.

611148	TITLE *611148 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 30 (ZINC TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 6; SLC30A6
;;ZINC TRANSPORTER 6; ZNT6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc functions as a cofactor for numerous enzymes, nuclear factors, and
hormones and as an intra- and intercellular signal ion. Members of the
zinc transporter (ZNT)/SLC30 subfamily of the cation diffusion
facilitator family, such as SLC30A6, permit cellular efflux of zinc
(Seve et al., 2004).

CLONING

Huang et al. (2002) identified mouse and human SLC30A6, which they
called ZNT6. The deduced mouse and human proteins contain 460 amino
acids and share 92% identity. Mouse Znt6 has 6 transmembrane domains, a
loop between transmembrane domains 4 and 5, and cytoplasmic N and C
termini. In contrast to other Znt proteins, the loop region of Znt6
lacks multiple histidines. Northern blot analysis detected 2 Znt6
transcripts expressed at variable levels in all mouse tissues examined,
with highest levels in liver and brain. Normal rat kidney cells
expressed Znt6 in a perinuclear location and in a punctate/tubular
pattern throughout the cytoplasm and under the plasma membrane.
Disruption of the Golgi compartment also disrupted Znt6 localization.

By EST database analysis, Seve et al. (2004) found evidence of high
SLC30A6 expression in B cells, colon, eye, and lung. Lower expression
was present in bone, brain, cervix, ear, heart, kidney, muscle, nerve,
pancreas, prostate, skin, stomach, and testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast mutants defective in zinc transport, Huang et al. (2002)
provided evidence that mouse Znt6 could export cytoplasmic zinc out of
the cell or transport it into an intracellular pool. The intracellular
localization of Znt6 in normal rat kidney cells was regulated by
extracellular zinc in a concentration-dependent manner, with zinc
causing Znt6 to diffuse from the perinuclear region toward cytoplasmic
structures and the cell periphery.

Using chicken B cells lacking Znt5 (607819), Znt6, and Znt7 (611149),
followed by reexpression of the human transgenes, Suzuki et al. (2005)
showed that ZNT5 and ZNT6 had to be coexpressed to transport zinc for
activation of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP, or ALPL;
171760) in the Golgi lumen, whereas ZNT7 acted alone to perform the same
function. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses showed
that ZNT5 and ZNT6 formed heterooligomers and that ZNT7 formed
homooligomers.

GENE STRUCTURE

Huang et al. (2002) determined that the SLC30A6 gene contains 14 exons
and spans 56 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Huang et al. (2002) mapped the SLC30A6
gene to chromosome 2p22-p21. The mouse Slc30a6 gene maps to a region of
chromosome 17 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
2p22-p21.

607263	TITLE *607263 EPSIN 2; EPN2
;;KIAA1065
DESCRIPTION For background information on epsins, see EPN1 (607262).

CLONING

Rosenthal et al. (1999) obtained a full-length cDNA encoding EPN2 by
ligating overlapping cDNA fragments identified by screening cerebellum
and brain cDNA libraries using a fragment of EPN1 as the probe. The
deduced 431-amino acid EPN2 protein has a domain structure similar to
that of EPN1, consisting of an epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) region,
a central region containing DPW repeats and an LLDL clathrin-binding
sequence, and a C-terminal EPS15 (600051) homology (EH) domain-binding
region containing 3 NPF repeats. However, unlike EPN1, EPN2 has no CDC2
(116940) phosphorylation site. The N-terminal region is well conserved
between EPN1 and EPN2, while the central and C-terminal domains are less
conserved. Rosenthal et al. (1999) also identified an EPN2 splice
variant that has a 58-amino acid deletion between the ENTH and DPW
domains. Western blot analysis revealed a doublet of 74 and 65 kD in
human brain, and a single band at 74 kD in rat brain and in transfected
CHO cells. Western blot analysis of several human and rat tissues
revealed a widespread tissue distribution, with highest levels in brain.

Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned EPN1, which they called KIAA1065, from a
size-fractionated brain cDNA library. The deduced protein contains 641
amino acids. RT-PCR and ELISA detected ubiquitous, moderate-to-high
expression of EPN2, with highest levels in several brain regions and
spinal cord.

GENE FUNCTION

Using EPN2 fragments to capture proteins contained within extracts of
rat brain, Rosenthal et al. (1999) determined that the NPF domain of
EPN2 bound specifically to EPS15, while the DPW domain bound AP2 (see
601026) and clathrin (see 118960). At low-to-moderate levels of
expression in CHO cells, fluorescence-tagged EPN2 appeared as fine
puncta throughout the cell, particularly in a central region where the
Golgi complex is localized; the distribution was similar to that of
clathrin. At high levels of expression, EPN2 showed intense continuous
labeling of the cell surface and 1 or more bright, compact masses in the
central region of the cell. In these cells, Rosenthal et al. (1999)
observed the redistribution and collapse of clathrin, EPS15, and AP2
into the same central mass(es), and these cells were deficient in

to chromosome 17.

;;THYMIDYLATE SYNTHASE, ANTISENSE; RTS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By RT-PCR of KB cells (a human oral epidermoid carcinoma cell line),
Dolnick (1993) cloned a cDNA, which he designated 3-prime rTS, that is
antisense to thymidylate synthase (TS, or TYMS; 188350) mRNA. He cloned
the full-length cDNA by 5-prime RACE of a squamous cell carcinoma cell
line. The mRNA contains 4 possible open reading frames. Dolnick (1993)
determined that the 3-prime end of rTS shares 99.5% identity with the
antisense strand of the 3-prime untranslated region of TS and contains 2
discontinuities. All of TS exon 7 and part of intron 6 are overlapped by
3-prime rTS. Northern blot analysis of fractionated KB cells and other
carcinoma cell lines revealed rTS transcripts of 1.8 and 6.3 kb, as well
as several larger mRNA species. The presence and relative abundance of
the larger transcripts varied between cell lines, and in vitro
translation generated multiple translation products.

By screening a KB cell cDNA library for homology with rTS, Dolnick and
Black (1996) identified an alternatively spliced transcript, which they
called rTS-beta. The rTS-beta transcript has an insertion of 116
nucleotides in its 5-prime region and an altered 3-prime noncoding
region that is not complementary to TS mRNA. Dolnick and Black (1996)
determined that the original rTS transcript, which they renamed
rTS-alpha, encodes a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 41 kD
that shares homology with a superfamily of proteins that includes
mandelate racemase and muconate-lactonizing enzyme from Pseudomonas
putida. The rTS-beta protein was expressed by KB cells and by a colon
tumor cell line at an apparent molecular mass of 48 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Dolnick and Black (1996) stated that rTS-alpha was overexpressed at both
the RNA and protein level in a leukemic cell line selected for
methotrexate resistance and that the overexpressing cell line lost its
ability to downregulate TS. Selection for 5-fluorouracil resistance in a
colon tumor cell line increased the expression of rTS-alpha and
rTS-beta, with highest expression of rTS-beta.

Chu and Dolnick (2002) found that rTS-alpha RNA and TS mRNA levels
varied inversely when the growth of HEp2 cells progressed from a
late-log phase to plateau phase. Transfection and expression of the
antisense region of rTS-alpha alone was sufficient to downregulate TS
mRNA. Downregulation was also associated with increased site-specific
cleavage of TS mRNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dolnick and Black (1996) determined that the ENOSF1 gene contains at
least 8 exons.

MAPPING

Dolnick (1993) identified the ENOSF1 gene on the complementary strand of
the TYMS gene, which maps to chromosome 18p11.32.

603518	TITLE *603518 TIA1 CYTOTOXIC GRANULE-ASSOCIATED RNA-BINDING PROTEIN; TIA1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The TIA1 gene encodes an RNA-binding protein involved in splicing
regulation and translational repression. It is a key component of stress
granules, which are cytoplasmic foci that sequester untranslated mRNAs
during different types of cellular stress. TIA1 is widely expressed,
including in skeletal muscle (summary by Hackman et al., 2013).

CLONING

TIA1 is a 15-kD cytoplasmic granule-associated protein expressed in
cytolytic lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer cells (Anderson et al.,
1990). Upon activation with mitogens or with antibodies reactive with
the T-cell receptor complex, the expression of TIA1 greatly increases
and 28-, 40-, and 53-kD forms of the protein are induced.

Tian et al. (1991) described the cDNA cloning and functional
characterization of 2 TIA1 isoforms. By immunoscreening a cytolytic
T-cell cDNA expression library with a monoclonal antibody against TIA1,
they isolated a 1.6-kb TIA1 cDNA encoding a deduced 146-amino acid
protein, referred to as rp15-TIA1, that has an apparent molecular mass
of 15 kD by SDS-PAGE. Using the 1.6-kb cDNA to screen a
phytohemagglutinin-activated T-cell cDNA library, the authors isolated a
2.2-kb cDNA encoding a deduced 375-amino acid protein, referred to as
rp40-TIA1, that has an apparent molecular mass of 40 kD by SDS-PAGE. The
1.6-kb cDNA is identical in sequence to the last 1,618 bp of the 2.2-kb
cDNA. The rp40-TIA1 protein contains 3 RNA-binding domains, each with 2
ribonucleoprotein consensus octapeptide sequences, at the N terminus,
and a glutamine-rich domain and a lysosomal membrane-targeting motif at
the C terminus; the rp15-TIA1 protein contains the glutamine-rich domain
and the lysosomal membrane-targeting motif. Tian et al. (1991) suggested
that the 15-kD TIA1 isoform may be derived from the 40-kD isoform by
proteolytic processing and showed that peripheral blood lymphocytes
express a protease capable of specifically cleaving rp40-TIA1, resulting
in the release of its 15-kD C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected
2.7- and 4.0-kb TIA1 transcripts in lymphocytes and 1.7-, 2.2-, 2.7-,
and 4.0-kb TIA1 transcripts in a cytotoxic T-cell clone.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kawakami et al. (1994) determined that the TIA1 gene contains 13 exons
and spans over 46 kb of genomic DNA. Although they identified the
transcription start site of the mRNA encoding the 40-kD TIA1 protein,
they could not identify a second promoter capable of initiating an mRNA
encoding the 15-kD TIA1 protein. This supports the possibility that the
15-kD isoform is derived from the 40-kD isoform by proteolysis.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Kawakami et al. (1994) mapped the TIA1 gene to
chromosome 2p13.

GENE FUNCTION

Tian et al. (1991) demonstrated that TIA1 is a nucleic acid-binding
protein that preferentially recognizes poly(A) homopolymers and induces
DNA fragmentation in permeabilized thymocytes. They suggested that TIA1
may be involved in the induction of apoptosis in CTL targets.

Forch et al. (2000) reported that the apoptosis-promoting protein TIA1
regulates alternative pre-mRNA splicing of the Drosophila male-specific
lethal-2 gene (MSL2; 614802) and of the human apoptotic gene FAS
(TNFRSF6; 134637). TIA1 associates selectively with pre-mRNAs that
contain 5-prime splice sites followed by U-rich sequences. TIA1 binding
to the U-rich stretches facilitates 5-prime splice site recognition by
U1 snRNP (see 180740). This activity is critical for activation of the
weak 5-prime splice site of Msl2 and for modulating the choice of splice
site partner in FAS. Structural and functional similarities with the S.
cerevisiae splicing factor Nam8 suggest striking evolutionary
conservation of a mechanism of pre-mRNA splicing regulation that
controls biologic processes as diverse as meiosis in yeast, dosage
compensation in fruit flies, or programmed cell death in humans.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By targeted high-throughput sequencing and Sanger sequencing of the
candidate Welander distal myopathy (WDM; 604454) region on chromosome
2p13, Hackman et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous mutation in the
TIA1 gene (E384K; 603518.0001) that segregated with the disorder in all
57 Swedish and Finnish patients studied. The same mutation was also
found in 3 patients from Great Britain, who had a partially shared
haplotype with the Nordic patients, indicating common ancestry.
Immunofluorescence microscopy of patient muscle showed diffuse
TIA1-labeled cytoplasmic aggregates or granules in some atrophic fibers
and fibers containing rimmed vacuoles. Expression of the mutant protein
in HeLa cells resulted in a mild increase (10-20%) of stress granule
numbers compared to controls. The increased number was apparently due to
a change in stress-granule dynamics, which Hackman et al. (2013)
concluded resulted from a gain of function.

Klar et al. (2013) also restricted the WDM-associated haplotype and
performed exome sequencing of 43 patients from 35 families with the
disorder. They identified a heterozygous E384K mutation in the TIA1 gene
in all patients. Patient muscle biopsies showed increased splicing of
exon 7 of the SMN2 gene (601627), reflecting impaired TIA1 function.
Klar et al. (2013) hypothesized that reduced activity of TIA1 may result
in decreased response to cellular stress, such as oxidative stress, that
may cause age-related cellular atrophy in patients carrying the
mutation. The mutation was estimated to have arisen 1,050 years earlier,
coinciding with the epoch of early seafaring across the Baltic Sea.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
WELANDER DISTAL MYOPATHY
TIA1, GLU384LYS

By targeted high-throughput sequencing and Sanger sequencing of the
candidate Welander distal myopathy (WDM; 604454) region on chromosome
2p13, Hackman et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous 1362G-A transition
in exon 13 of the TIA1 gene, resulting in a glu384-to-lys (E384K;
603518.0001) substitution that segregated with the disorder in all 57
Swedish and Finnish patients studied. The same mutation was also found
in 3 patients from Great Britain who had a partially shared haplotype
with the Nordic patients, indicating common ancestry. The mutation was
not found in 202 Finnish control samples. The E384K mutation occurred at
a highly conserved residue in the RNA-binding domain of the protein at
the C terminus, also known as the prion-related domain that is required
for TIA1 aggregation in stress granules. Immunofluorescence microscopy
of patient muscle showed diffuse TIA1-labeled cytoplasmic aggregates or
granules in some atrophic fibers and fibers containing rimmed vacuoles.
However, most fibers appeared normal and had normal TIA1 nuclear
localization. Analysis of TIA1 splice isoforms and protein stability
showed no consistent differences between WDM muscle and control muscle.
Expression of the mutant protein in HeLa cells resulted in a mild
increased (10-20%) of stress granule numbers compared to controls. The
increased number was apparently due to a change in stress-granule
dynamics resulting from a gain of function.

Klar et al. (2013) also restricted the WDM-associated haplotype and
performed exome sequencing of 43 patients from 35 families with the
disorder. They identified a heterozygous E384K mutation resulting from a
1150G-A transition in the TIA1 gene and occurring in a Q-rich domain.
The mutation was not found in 800 control chromosomes. Patient muscle
biopsies showed increased splicing of exon 7 of the SMN2 gene (601627),
reflecting impaired TIA1 function. Klar et al. (2013) hypothesized that
reduced activity of TIA1 may result in decreased response to cellular
stress, such as oxidative stress, that may cause age-related cellular
atrophy in patients carrying the mutation. The age of the mutation was
estimated to be 1,050 year ago, coinciding with the epoch of early
seafaring across the Baltic Sea.

609397	TITLE *609397 STORKHEAD BOX 1; STOX1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing genes within the critical region defined for a
preeclampsia locus on chromosome 10 (609404), van Dijk et al. (2005)
identified STOX1. RT-PCR detected 4 STOX1 splice variants in early
placenta, including invasive extravillous trophoblasts. The variants
encode 3 different proteins of 989 (isoform A), 227 (isoform B), and 169
(isoform C) amino acids. Isoform A has an 87-amino acid DNA-binding
winged helix domain, a nuclear localization signal, and a nuclear export
signal. The winged helix domain does not have the characteristic Y/F
sequence conserved in the related FOXO protein family. Isoform B lacks
the nuclear export signal, and isoform C lacks the nuclear export signal
and part of the winged helix domain. Immunolocalization of
fluorescence-tagged proteins localized isoform A to either the nucleus
or the cytoplasm of transfected immortalized normal diploid extravillous
trophoblasts, but no cells showed both nuclear and cytoplasmic
fluorescence. Isoform B localized to the nucleus, and isoform C to the
nucleolus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Van Dijk et al. (2005) determined that the STOX1 gene contains 5
alternatively spliced exons. Exons 1 and 2 are separated by an intron of
54 kb, and the start codon in exon 1 is contained within a CpG island of
about 1.5 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, van Dijk et al. (2005) mapped the STOX1
gene to chromosome 10q22.1 in a region that contains a cluster of DNA-
and RNA-binding proteins.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In preeclamptic sib pairs from 24 Dutch families, van Dijk et al. (2005)
identified 5 different missense mutations in the STOX1 gene, including
tyr153 to his (Y153H; 609397.0001) and glu608 to asp (E608D;
609397.0002); all 5 mutations were identical between affected sisters,
cosegregated with the preeclamptic phenotype, and followed matrilineal
inheritance. The Y153H mutation was the most common, occurring in 23 of
the 24 sib pairs; 6 sib pairs carried more than 1 mutation. Van Dijk et
al. (2005) concluded that STOX1 is a maternal-effect gene and that loss
of function of STOX1 in the placenta underlies preeclampsia (PEE4;
609404) in Dutch females.

Iglesias-Platas et al. (2007) concluded that their data did not support
the hypothesis that STOX1 has a role in maternal transmission of the
preeclampsia phenotype, either through an epigenetic mechanism or
through matrilineal transmission of polymorphic variants. In their
cohorts, the amino acid changes observed behaved as simple polymorphisms
rather than as mutations associated with a pathogenic condition. They
observed a high frequency of the CC genotype of the Y153H variation
(609397.0001) in uncomplicated pregnancies, demonstrating that this
allele cannot be considered a mutation predisposing to preeclampsia. In
the reply to Iglesias-Platas et al. (2007), van Dijk et al. (2007)
pointed out that preeclampsia occurs in at least 2 forms, placental and
maternal, which differ in etiology and in genetic risk and inheritance
(Oudejans et al., 2007). The placental form runs in families, with
recurrence across generations and occurrence within families. The
maternal form is likely to involve a maternal susceptibility gene with
low effect. By design, affected sib pair studies described by van Dijk
et al. (2005) target the familial form. The high incidence of
intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) confirms the early placental
origin of the familial form.

Kivinen et al. (2007) failed to find evidence in support of STOX1 as a
preeclampsia gene in a cohort of 245 Finnish women with preeclampsia
using genetic linkage analysis and haplotype analysis. They noted that
STOX1 expression studies with RNA from placentas of 8 preeclamptic and 6
uncomplicated deliveries failed to show a significant difference in
expression levels.

By using complementary in vitro and ex vivo approaches, van Dijk et al.
(2010) showed that the STOX1 risk allele Y153H 609397.0001 negatively
regulated trophoblast invasion by upregulation of the cell-cell adhesion
protein alpha-T-catenin (CTNNA3; 607667). This was effectuated at the
crucial epithelial-mesenchymal transition from proliferative into
invasive extravillous trophoblast. The STOX1-CTNNA3 interaction was
direct and included Akt (164730)-mediated phosphorylated control of
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and ubiquitin-mediated degradation similar
to that of FOX multigene family members (see, e.g., FOXO3A, 602681). The
authors concluded that Y153H directly limits first-trimester
extravillous trophoblast invasion, the earliest hallmark of
preeclampsia.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PREECLAMPSIA/ECLAMPSIA 4
STOX1, TYR153HIS

In 23 preeclamptic Dutch sib pairs (609404), van Dijk et al. (2005)
identified a tyr153-to-his (Y153H) substitution in exon 2 of the STOX1
gene. The substitution arose from a 458T-C transition. The authors
traced informative nucleotide variations across 3 generations in 6 of
the 23 families and found that the mutation on the maternal allele in
the second generation was transmitted to 13 children in the third
generation who were born from preeclamptic pregnancies, whereas the 2
children who were born of normal pregnancies did not carry the mutated
maternal allele.

Iglesias-Platas et al. (2007) observed a high frequency of the CC
genotype of the Y153H variation in uncomplicated pregnancies, which led
them to conclude that this allele cannot be considered a mutation
predisposing to preeclampsia.

.0002
PREECLAMPSIA/ECLAMPSIA 4
STOX1, GLU608ASP

In 2 preeclamptic Dutch sib pairs (609404), van Dijk et al. (2005)
identified a glu608-to-asp (E608D) substitution in exon 3 of the STOX1
gene. The mutation was also found in their mothers, who had a history of
pregnancy-induced hypertension (see 189800). One sib pair also carried
the Y153H mutation (609397.0001): 1 third-generation daughter carried
both mutations and was born of a preeclamptic pregnancy; the other
carried neither and was born of a normal pregnancy.

;;RIBOSOMAL RNA-PROCESSING PROTEIN 42, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; RRP42;;
KIAA0116
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing cDNAs randomly selected from a cDNA library derived from
the human immature myeloid cell line KG-1, Nagase et al. (1995) isolated
a cDNA encoding RRP42, which they designated KIAA0116. The predicted
290-amino acid KIAA0116 protein is 26.7% identical to the 75-kD
autoantigen (PMSCL1; 606180) over a 225-amino acid region. Northern blot
analysis detected expression of KIAA0116 in all tissues tested.

Inherently unstable mammalian mRNAs contain AU-rich elements (AREs)
within their 3-prime untranslated regions. In yeast, 3-prime-to-5-prime
mRNA degradation is mediated by the exosome, a multisubunit particle.
Chen et al. (2001) purified and characterized the human exosome by mass
spectrometry and found its composition to be similar to its yeast
counterpart. They identified the following protein subunits within the
human exosome: p7, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp4 protein
(602238); p8, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp42 protein; p9, which
is homologous to the yeast Rrp43 protein (OIP2; 606019); p10, which is
homologous to the yeast Rrp40 protein (606489); p11, which is homologous
to the yeast Mtr3 protein (606490); p12A, which is homologous to the
yeast Rrp41 protein (606491); p12B, which is homologous to the yeast
Rrp46 protein (606492); and p13, which is homologous to the yeast Csl4
protein (606493). They also identified 2 exosome-associated factors, p1
(600478) and p14 (MPP6; 605500), that were not homologous to any yeast
exosome components.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a cell-free RNA decay system, Chen et al. (2001) demonstrated that
the mammalian exosome is required for rapid degradation of
ARE-containing RNAs but not for poly(A) shortening. They found that the
mammalian exosome does not recognize ARE-containing RNAs on its own. ARE
recognition required certain ARE-binding proteins that could interact
with the exosome and recruit it to unstable RNAs, thereby promoting
their rapid degradation.

Using mammalian 2-hybrid and GST pull-down analyses, Raijmakers et al.
(2002) found that the CSL4 protein, but not mutant forms lacking N- or
C-terminal residues, interacted directly with RRP42 and RRP46. The
deletion mutants were also unable to interact with the exosome. RRP42
and RRP46 did not interact with each other.

MAPPING

By analysis of a panel of human/rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al.
(1995) mapped the KIAA0116 gene to chromosome 3.

165161	TITLE *165161 ONCOGENE JUN-B; JUNB
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FUNCTION

Jacobs-Helber et al. (2002) studied the role of JUNB in erythroid
differentiation in an erythropoietin (EPO; 133170)-dependent cell line
and in primary mouse and human erythroid cells. They identified an
initial EPO-dependent induction of JUNB expression that was insufficient
to induce differentiation. A second EPO-independent peak of JUNB
expression was associated with erythroid cell differentiation as
measured by increased expression of erythroid-specific proteins.

Mathas et al. (2002) found AP1 constitutively activated, with robust JUN
(165160) and JUNB overexpression, in all cell lines derived from
patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (236000) and anaplastic large
cell lymphoma (ALCL), but not in other lymphoma types. AP1 supported
proliferation of Hodgkin cells, but suppressed apoptosis of ALCL cells.
Mathas et al. (2002) noted that, whereas JUN is upregulated by an
autoregulatory process, JUNB is under the control of nuclear factor
kappa-B (NFKB; 164011). They found that AP1 and NFKB cooperate and
stimulate expression of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D2 (123833), the
protooncogene MET (164860), and the lymphocyte homing receptor CCR7
(600242), which are all strongly expressed in primary
Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells.

Gao et al. (2004) found in the case of c-JUN and JUNB that extracellular
stimuli modulate protein turnover by regulating the activity of an E3
ligase by means of its phosphorylation. Activation of the Jun
amino-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
cascade after T cell stimulation accelerated degradation of c-JUN and
JUNB through phosphorylation-dependent activation of the E3 ligase ITCH
(606409). Gao et al. (2004) found that this pathway modulates cytokine
production by effector T cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

In comparisons of the murine and human junB loci, Phinney et al. (1995)
found 9 regions of distal 5-prime and 3-prime flanking DNA that
exhibited greater than 72% sequence identity. More than 50% of the JUNB
locus is contained in these flanking evolutionarily conserved sequences
(FECSs), which may be required for effecting the proper transcriptional
regulation of the gene. Comparative sequence analyses involving
kilobases of distal flanking DNAs for only a small number of vertebrate
genes suggested that FECSs may emerge as common yet important functional
components of genes. If they account for a large fraction of the
conserved sequence within a disease-related locus, then deleterious
mutations might frequently occur in these regions and go undetected with
current strategies.

Zenz et al. (2005) found reduced JunB expression in lesional skin of
severe psoriasis and intermediate expression in mild psoriasis.

MAPPING

Mattei et al. (1990) mapped 3 members of the JUN protooncogene family in
the mouse: JUN to mouse chromosome 4 and JUNB and JUND (165162) to the
same region of mouse chromosome 8. RFLP analysis of interspecific
hybrids confirmed the mapping of JUNB and JUND and showed that they are
situated about 7.3 cM apart. Using the same probes for in situ
hybridization, Mattei et al. (1990) showed that the human genes are
located on 19p13.2, a region that is involved in chromosome
translocations in cases of leukemia. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Trask et al. (1993) assigned the JUNB gene to 19p13.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Passegue et al. (2001) created transgenic mice specifically lacking JunB
expression in the myeloid lineage. These mice developed a transplantable
myeloproliferative disease, eventually progressing to blast crisis, that
resembled human chronic myeloid leukemia. Similarly, mice reconstituted
with embryonic stem cell-derived JunB -/- fetal liver cells also
developed a myeloproliferative disease. In both cases, the absence of
JunB expression resulted in increased numbers of granulocyte progenitors
that displayed enhanced granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GMCSF, or CSF2; 138960)-mediated proliferation and extended survival,
associated with changes in the expression levels of the GMCSF
receptor-alpha (CSF2RA; 306250), the antiapoptotic proteins BCL2
(151430) and BCLX (600039), and the cell cycle regulators p16INK4A
(CDKN2A; 600160) and JUN. Ectopic expression of JunB fully reverted the
immature and hyperproliferative phenotype of JunB-deficient myeloid
cells. These results identified JUNB as a key transcriptional regulator
of myelopoiesis and a potential tumor suppressor gene.

Passegue et al. (2004) investigated the function of JunB during normal
and leukemic hematopoiesis using a JunB transgenic mouse model
associated with myeloproliferative disorder (Passegue et al., 2001), as
well as several models of conditional inactivation and overexpression of
JunB in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). They showed that JunB regulates
the numbers of HSCs. JunB overexpression decreased the frequency of
long-term HSCs, while JunB inactivation specifically expanded the
numbers of long-term HSCs and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors,
resulting in chronic myeloproliferative disorder. Passegue et al. (2004)
demonstrated that JunB inactivation must have taken place in long-term
HSCs, and not at later stages of myelopoiesis, to induce
myeloproliferative disorder, and that only JunB-deficient long-term HSCs
were capable of transplanting the myeloproliferative disorder to
recipient mice. These results demonstrated a stem cell-specific role for
JunB in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis and provided experimental
evidence that leukemic stem cells can reside at the long-term HSC stage
of development in a mouse model of myeloproliferative disorder.

The JUN and JUNB components of the AP1 transcription factor are known to
have antagonistic functions. Passegue et al. (2002) showed, by a knockin
strategy and a transgenic complementation approach, that JunB can
substitute for absence of Jun during mouse development. JunB can rescue
both liver and cardiac defects in Jun-null mice in a manner dependent on
gene dosage. JunB restores the expression of genes regulated by Jun/Fos
(164810), but not those regulated by Jun/ATF (ATF1; 123803), thereby
rescuing Jun-dependent defects in vivo as well as in primary fibroblasts
and fetal hepatoblasts in vitro. Thus, the transcriptionally less active
JunB has the potential to substitute for Jun, indicating that the
spatial and temporal regulation of expression of the transcription
factor AP1 may be more important than the coding sequence of its
components.

Zenz et al. (2005) designed inducible, conditional, single- and
double-knockout mice for JunB and c-Jun. Mutant mice and littermate
controls were treated with tamoxifen at 8 weeks of age. Single-mutant
mice did not show any skin phenotype up to 2 months after deletion.
However, in JunB/c-Jun double-mutant mice, alterations to the hairless
skin appeared 8 to 10 days after tamoxifen induction. After 18 days of
tamoxifen treatment, 100% of the double-mutant mice showed a strong
phenotype with scaly plaques affecting primarily ears, paws, and tail,
and less frequently the hairy back skin. Histology of affected skin from
mutant mice showed the hallmarks of psoriasis, such as a strongly
thickened epidermis with prominent rete ridges, thickened keratinized
upper layers (hyperkeratosis) and parakeratosis (nucleated keratinocytes
in the cornified layer) and increased subepidermal vascularization.
Arthritic lesions strongly reminiscent of psoriatic arthritis were
observed with 100% penetrance.

DROSOPHILA RHOMBOID-LIKE;;
RHOMBOID-RELATED PROTEIN; RRP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Drosophila Rhomboid protein has been implicated in the modulation of
epidermal growth factor receptor (see 131550) signaling. By searching
sequence databases for Rhomboid homologs, Pascall and Brown (1998)
identified a human genomic clone containing the RRP (Rhomboid-related
protein) gene. Using a PCR strategy with cDNA derived from a human
leukemic cell line, the authors cloned cDNAs corresponding to the entire
RRP coding region. Sequence analysis indicated that the predicted
438-amino acid protein has 7 transmembrane domains and an intracellular
N terminus. RRP and Rhomboid share 30% amino acid sequence identity. By
Northern blot analysis, Pascall and Brown (1998) determined that RRP is
expressed as a 1.7-kb mRNA in brain and kidney; larger transcripts were
detected in heart, skeletal muscle, and brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pascall and Brown (1998) determined that the RRP gene contains 7 exons
that span approximately 2.2 kb.

MAPPING

Pascall and Brown (1998) stated that the genomic clone containing the
RRP gene was derived from human chromosome 16.

604470	TITLE *604470 CD2 ANTIGEN-BINDING PROTEIN 2; CD2BP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Human CD2 (186990) facilitates both adhesion and activation of T
lymphocytes on binding to its ligand CD58 (LFA3; 153420). This binding
augments interleukin-12 (IL12; see 161560)-driven T-cell responsiveness.
By use of interaction trap cloning with the yeast 2-hybrid system and
5-prime RACE PCR, Nishizawa et al. (1998) identified a T-cell line cDNA
encoding a 341-amino acid protein, termed CD2BP2, that interacts with
the cytoplasmic tail of CD2. The authors noted that a segment near the C
terminus contains a consensus site for tyrosine phosphorylation. RNA
blot analysis indicated that CD2BP2 is expressed in a wide variety of
organs as approximately 1.35- and 4-kb transcripts. Immunoprecipitation
experiments showed that CD2BP2 expressed in J77 Jurkat and COS-7 cells
associates specifically with CD2. Mutation analysis suggested that a
21-amino acid motif is critical for CD2 binding and that 2 PPPGHR
sequences within the CD2 cytoplasmic tail mediate the binding to CD2BP2.
Additional transfection studies showed that CD2BP2 expression
selectively enhances IL2 (147680) production on crosslinking of CD2.

DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

Cannizzaro et al. (1993) mapped a member of the KOX gene family, ZNF23
(KOX16), to 16q22 by in situ hybridization. The map location is near 2
fragile sites, FRA16B and FRA16C. The 16q22 region is involved,
furthermore, in chromosomal alterations characteristic of acute myeloid
leukemia. The ZNF19 gene (194525) maps to the same region. Analogous
genes in the mouse map to chromosome 8 in a region of syntenic homology.
By pulsed field gel electrophoresis experiments, Rousseau-Merck et al.
(1993) showed that the ZNF19 and ZNF23 genes lie within a 200-300 kb DNA
fragment.

604449	TITLE *604449 PROTEASOME 26S SUBUNIT, NON-ATPase, 11; PSMD11
;;PROTEASE 26S, SUBUNIT 9; S9;;
p44.5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PSMD11 gene encodes a non-ATPase subunit of the PA700 regulatory
subcomplex of the 26S proteasome. The 26S proteasome is responsible for
the ATP-dependent degradation of a variety of cellular proteins.
Selective breakdown of these proteins is mediated by the ubiquitin
pathway. The 26S proteasome is a 2,000-kD protein complex composed of
the 20S proteasome, which is the catalytic subcomplex, and PA700, which
is the regulatory subcomplex. The approximately 700-kD PA700 complex
consists of approximately 20 heterogeneous proteins ranging from 25 to
112 kD. These subunits can be divided into 2 classes, those that are
members of the AAA (ATPases associated with various cellular activities)
family and those that are not (summary by Hoffman and Rechsteiner, 1997,
Saito et al., 1997).

CLONING

Hoffman and Rechsteiner (1997) sequenced peptides from subunit 9 of the
human 26S proteasome. Using the amino acid sequences, they cloned HeLa
cell cDNAs encoding subunit 9, also called PSMD11. The predicted
422-amino acid protein has 9 dileucine repeats, possible coiled-coil
domains, and potential myristylation and phosphorylation sites. PSMD11
is not a member of the ATPase family. Whereas the calculated molecular
mass of PSMD11 is 47,469 Da, it migrates as an approximately 46-kD
protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels.

Saito et al. (1997) sequenced peptides from the p44.5 subunit of the
bovine PA700 complex. They identified human ESTs encoding homologous
proteins and used these ESTs to isolate hepatoblastoma HepG2 cell cDNAs
encoding human p44.5. The authors stated that the p44.5 subunit is
equivalent to subunit 9 (Hoffman and Rechsteiner, 1997), or PSMD11.
Saito et al. (1997) identified a putative S. cerevisiae homolog, which
they named NAS4, that shares 45.4% amino acid sequence identity with
PSMD11. Disruption of the NAS4 gene resulted in lethality.

GENE FUNCTION

Vilchez et al. (2012) demonstrated that human embryonic stem cells
exhibit high proteasome activity that is correlated with increased
levels of the 19S proteasome subunit PSMD11 and a corresponding
increased assembly of the 26S/30S proteasome. Ectopic expression of
PSMD11 is sufficient to increase proteasome assembly and activity. FOXO4
(300033), an insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF1;
147440)-responsive transcription factor associated with long lifespan in
invertebrates, regulates proteasome activity by modulating the
expression of PSMD11 in human embryonic stem cells. Proteasome
inhibition in human embryonic stem cells affects the expression of
pluripotency markers and the levels of specific markers of the distinct
germ layers. Vilchez et al. (2012) concluded that their results
suggested a new regulation of proteostasis in human embryonic stem cells
that links longevity and stress resistance in invertebrates to human
embryonic stem cell function and identity.

607290	TITLE *607290 SHISA, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF, 5; SHISA5
;;SCOTIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zhang et al. (2000) cloned a cDNA encoding Scotin, which they called
HSPC217, from CD34 (142230)-positive hematopoietic stem/progenitor
cells. The deduced 170-amino acid protein contains an MYB (189990)
DNA-binding domain repeat signature. Microarray analysis of 5
hematopoietic cell lines detected low-level expression of Scotin in NB4
and Jurkat cells, but no expression was detected in HL60, K562, and U937
cells.

Bourdon et al. (2002) identified mouse Scotin by differential display of
spleen and thymus of normal and p53 (191170) null mice after gamma
irradiation of whole animals. The induced 1.85-kb transcript encodes a
deduced 235-amino acid protein. By searching an EST database using the
mouse sequence as probe, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Bourdon
et al. (2002) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding Scotin from a placenta
cDNA library. The deduced 240-amino acid human protein shares 70%
identity with mouse Scotin. Both the human and the mouse proteins
contain an N-terminal signal sequence, a central transmembrane domain
composed of 18 hydrophobic amino acids, and a proline/tyrosine domain,
and both show an apparent molecular mass of 25 kD by Western blot
analysis. Immunolocalization of exogenously expressed Scotin revealed
colocalization with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers. By mutation
analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the proline-rich domain
is required for ER localization.

GENE FUNCTION

Bourdon et al. (2002) noted that mouse thymus and spleen cells underwent
massive p53-dependent apoptosis following ultraviolet irradiation or
exposure to actinomycin D. They found that Scotin mRNA was induced
coincident with apoptosis and was expressed only in spleen and thymus of
irradiated wildtype mice and not in the spleen or thymus of irradiated
p53 null mice. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, they
confirmed direct binding between p53 and Scotin, and using a luciferase
reporter plasmid driven by the mouse Scotin promoter, they confirmed
dose-dependent p53 transactiviation. Furthermore, Bourdon et al. (2002)
showed that the apoptosis induced by the p53/Scotin pathway is caspase
dependent.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the
human Scotin gene contains 6 exons. They identified a p53-responsive
element of 9 decamers within the mouse Scotin promoter.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Zhang et al. (2000) mapped the human
Scotin gene to chromosome 3. By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et
al. (2002) mapped the Scotin gene to chromosome 3p21.3. They also
identified a Scotin pseudogene on chromosome Xq13.1-q13.3.

607990	TITLE *607990 UBIQUITIN-LIKE PROTEIN CONTAINING PHD AND RING FINGER DOMAINS 1; UHRF1
;;INVERTED CCAAT BOX-BINDING PROTEIN, 90-KD; ICBP90;;
NUCLEAR PHOSPHOPROTEIN, 95-KD; NP95
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

UHRF1 binds to an inverted CCAAT box in the promoter of topoisomerase
II-alpha (TOP2A; 126430). TOP2A introduces transient double-stranded
breaks in DNA, which are required during the cell cycle for DNA
replication, chromosome condensation, and segregation. UHRF1 is likely
involved in TOPO2A expression (Hopfner et al., 2000).

CLONING

By yeast 1-hybrid analysis of a Jurkat leukemia cell line cDNA library
using the second inverted CCAAT box (ICB2) of the TOP2A promoter as
bait, followed by screening an adult thymus cDNA library, Hopfner et al.
(2000) cloned UHRF1, which they called ICBP90. The deduced 793-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 90 kD. ICBP90
contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain partially overlapped by a
leucine zipper domain, followed by a central zinc finger of the PHD
finger type and a C-terminal zinc finger of the ring finger type. It
also has 2 nuclear localization signals, phosphorylation sites for
several kinases, and a consensus Rb1 (614041)-binding sequence. RNA dot
blot analysis detected expression of ICBP90 at highest levels in adult
and fetal thymus, followed by fetal liver, adult bone marrow, testis,
lung, heart, and fetal kidney. Highly differentiated tissues, such as
central nervous system and peripheral blood leukocytes, showed no
detectable expression. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed nuclear
expression of both endogenous HeLa cell ICBP90 and ICBP90 ectopically
expressed in COS-1 cells. Western blot analysis detected ICBP90 at an
apparent molecular mass of 97 kD in confluent HeLa cells; a minor 50-kD
band was also detected. Other bands were observed in proliferating HeLa
cells. Histochemical analysis of appendix showed expression restricted
to areas of cell proliferation (germinal centers and glandular crypts),
where ICBP90 colocalized with TOP2A. Expression of both proteins was
elevated in high-grade breast carcinomas and slightly elevated in
low-grade breast carcinomas.

By Northern blot analysis, Hopfner et al. (2001) detected transcripts of
5.1 and 4.3 kb in several cancer cell lines. The relative amount of each
transcript depended upon the tissue of origin.

GENE FUNCTION

Hopfner et al. (2000) determined that ICBP90 bound the ICB2 of TOP2A in
vivo and in vitro, and that expression of ICBP90 was concomitant with
expression of TOP2A in human lung fibroblasts and several cell lines.
Transfection of ICBP90 into COS-1 cells resulted in enhanced expression
of both ICBP90 and TOP2A.

Bonapace et al. (2002) determined that mouse Np95 is an early target of
the oncogenic DNA virus, adenovirus E1A, during induced proliferation.
E1A induced Np95 expression in terminally differentiated mouse myotubes.
The concomitant expression of Np95 and of cyclin E (123837)-Cdk2
(116953) was sufficient to induce S phase in these cells. In mouse
fibroblasts, expression of Np95 was tightly regulated during the cell
cycle, and its functional ablation abrogated DNA synthesis. Bonapace et
al. (2002) concluded that Np95 is essential for S phase entry.

Bostick et al. (2007) showed that the protein UHRF1, also known as NP95
in mouse and ICBP90 in human, is required for maintaining DNA
methylation. UHRF1 colocalizes with the maintenance DNA
methyltransferase protein DNMT1 (126375) throughout S phase. UHRF1
appears to tether DNMT1 to chromatin through its direct interaction with
DNMT1. Furthermore, UHRF1 contains a methyl DNA binding domain, the SRA
(SET- and RING-associated) domain, that shows strong preferential
binding to hemimethylated CG sites, the physiologic substrate for DNMT1.
Bostick et al. (2007) concluded that UHRF1 may help recruit DNMT1 to
hemimethylated DNA to facilitate faithful maintenance of DNA
methylation.

Sharif et al. (2007) demonstrated that localization of mouse Np95 to
replicating heterochromatin is dependent on the presence of
hemimethylated DNA. Np95 forms complexes with Dnmt1 and mediates the
loading of Dnmt1 to replicating heterochromatic regions. By using
Np95-deficient embryonic stem cells and embryos, Sharif et al. (2007)
showed that Np95 is essential in vivo to maintain global and local DNA
methylation and to repress transcription of retrotransposons and
imprinted genes. Sharif et al. (2007) concluded that the link between
hemimethylated DNA, Np95, and Dnmt1 thus establishes key steps of the
mechanism for epigenetic inheritance of DNA methylation.

Sen et al. (2010) showed that DNMT1 (126375) is essential for epidermal
progenitor cell function. DNMT1 protein was found enriched in
undifferentiated cells, where it was required to retain proliferative
stamina and suppress differentiation. In tissue, DNMT1 depletion led to
exit from the progenitor cell compartment, premature differentiation,
and eventual tissue loss. Genomewide analysis showed that a significant
portion of epidermal differentiation gene promoters were methylated in
self-renewing conditions but were subsequently demethylated during
differentiation. Furthermore, UHRF1, a component of the DNA methylation
machinery that targets DNMT1 to hemimethylated DNA, is also necessary to
suppress premature differentiation and sustain proliferation. In
contrast, Gadd45A (126335) and B (604948), which promote active DNA
demethylation, are required for full epidermal differentiation gene
induction. Sen et al. (2010) concluded that proteins involved in the
dynamic regulation of DNA methylation patterns are required for
progenitor maintenance and self-renewal in mammalian somatic tissue.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Avvakumov et al. (2008) reported the 1.7-angstrom crystal structure of
the SRA domain of human UHRF1 and the 2.2-angstrom structure of the SRA
domain in complex with a 12-bp double-stranded DNA with a central
hemimethylated CpG. In the SRA-DNA complex, the 5-methylcytosine was
flipped out of the duplex DNA and interacted with a binding pocket of
the SRA domain. Two loops in the SRA domain reached through the
resulting gap in the DNA from both the major and minor grooves to read
the other 3 bases of the CpG duplex. The major groove loop appeared to
confer both specificity for the CpG dinucleotide and discrimination
against methylation of deoxycytidine of the complementary strand.

Arita et al. (2008) and Hashimoto et al. (2008) determined the crystal
structure of the SRA domain of mouse Uhrf1 in complex with
hemimethylated CpG and presented findings similar to those of Avvakumov
et al. (2008).

GENE STRUCTURE

Hopfner et al. (2001) determined that the ICBP90 gene contains 8 exons
and spans about 35 kD. Exons 1 and 2 are noncoding. The promoter region
contains 3 Sp1 (189906)-binding sites.

MAPPING

By FISH, Hopfner et al. (2001) mapped the UHRF1 gene to chromosome
19p13.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Muto et al. (2002) determined that inactivation of mouse Np95 was lethal
to midgestation embryos. Using Np95 null embryonic stem cells, they
found that lack of Np95 expression increased cell sensitivity to
inhibition of DNA replication and to DNA damaging agents, including
x-rays, ultraviolet light, and alkylation.

608613	TITLE *608613 TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR Sp6; SP6
;;KRUPPEL-LIKE FACTOR 14; KLF14;;
EPIPROFIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SP6 belongs to a family of transcription factors that contain 3
classical zinc finger DNA-binding domains consisting of a zinc atom
tetrahedrally coordinated by 2 cysteines and 2 histidines (C2H2 motif).
These transcription factors bind to GC-rich sequences and related GT and
CACCC boxes (Scohy et al., 2000).

CLONING

By searching for sequences related to the zinc finger DNA-binding domain
of SP1 (189906), followed by screening a fetal mouse liver cDNA library,
Scohy et al. (2000) cloned mouse Sp6, which they designated Klf14. By
database analysis, they identified human SP6. Mouse and human SP6 encode
deduced 376-amino acid proteins that share 96% amino acid identity.
Residues within each of the 3 zinc fingers that establish specific
contacts with DNA are completely conserved in SP6, suggesting that mouse
and human SP6 recognize a classical GC box. RT-PCR analysis revealed SP6
expression in all mouse tissues examined.

Nakamura et al. (2004) cloned mouse Sp6, which they called epiprofin.
The 5-prime sequence of mouse epiprofin differs from the sequence
reported by Scohy et al. (2000) and shares 80% identity with the 5-prime
sequence of human SP6. The Sp6 open reading frames reported by Nakamura
et al. (2004) and Scohy et al. (2000) are identical. Nakamura et al.
(2004) identified 2 C-terminal nuclear localization signals in the Sp6
protein. Northern blot analysis of several mouse tissues detected a
3.6-kb transcript only in newborn mouse molar RNA. RT-PCR analysis
detected expression in newborn mouse molar and incisor RNA, with faint
expression in skin, but not in any other tissue. In situ hybridization
of developing mouse embryos revealed epiprofin expressed primarily by
proliferating epithelial cells of teeth, hair follicles, developing
limbs, and the posterior neuropore. Fluorescence-labeled epiprofin
localized to the nucleus of transfected COS-7 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Nakamura et al. (2004) determined that endogenous epiprofin expressed by
primary mouse dental epithelial cells and epiprofin expressed by
transfected COS-7 cells promoted cell proliferation. Transfection of an
N-terminally truncated vector containing only the zinc finger domain
resulted in no activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Scohy et al. (2000) determined that the mouse and human SP6 genes
contain 2 exons. Exon 1 contains a potential ATG translation initiator
codon and an upstream TATAA box. Exon 2 contains a second potential ATG
start codon. Both potential initiator codons are in-frame with the zinc
finger protein sequence.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, Scohy et al. (2000) mapped the
SP6 gene to chromosome 17q21.3-q22.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Small et al. (2011) showed that the lipid phenotype-associated
cis-acting expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), represented by
dbSNP rs4731702, of the maternally expressed transcription factor KLF14
is a master trans regulator of adipose gene expression. Expression
levels of genes regulated by this trans-eQTL were highly correlated with
concurrently measured metabolic traits, and a subset of the
trans-regulated genes harbored variants directly associated with
metabolic phenotypes.

603571	TITLE *603571 VANIN 2; VNN2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mouse vanin-1 (see VNN1; 603570) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored cell surface molecule that is involved in the thymus
homing of bone marrow cells. By screening cDNA libraries with a mouse
vanin-1 cDNA, Galland et al. (1998) identified a partial human cDNA
encoding vanin-2 (VNN2), a vanin-like protein. Using RACE PCR to isolate
additional cDNAs, they determined the entire VNN2 coding sequence. The
deduced VNN2 protein shares 64% sequence identity with mouse vanin-1 and
VNN1, the human homolog of mouse vanin-1. Like VNN1, VNN2 contains a
C-terminal GPI cleavage motif; however, it lacks a leader peptide. VNN2
translated in vitro migrated as a 53-kD protein. Northern blot analysis
revealed that the 2.3-kb VNN2 mRNA is expressed in spleen, thymus,
peripheral blood lymphocytes, and kidney.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and analysis of somatic cell
hybrids, Galland et al. (1998) mapped the VNN2 gene to 6q23-q24. They
identified a YAC clone from 6q23-q24 that contained both the VNN1 and
VNN2 genes.

604627	TITLE *604627 INTERLEUKIN 17B; IL17B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Interleukin-17 (IL17; 603149) is a T cell-derived cytokine that may play
an important role in the initiation or maintenance of the
proinflammatory response. Whereas expression of IL17 is restricted to
activated T cells, IL17 receptor (IL17R; 605461) has been shown to be
widely expressed, a finding consistent with the pleiotropic activities
of IL17. Li et al. (2000) cloned and expressed 2 novel human cytokines,
IL17B and IL17C (604628), that are related to IL17 (approximately 27%
amino acid identity). Northern blot analysis detected an 800-bp IL17B
mRNA in adult pancreas, small intestine, and stomach, whereas IL17C mRNA
was not detected in several adult tissues. No expression of IL17B or
IL17C mRNA was found in activated T cells. The authors found that IL17B
and IL17C differ from IL17 in their patterns of expression and biologic
activities. These findings, coupled with the lack of interaction with
the known IL17 receptor, suggested an expanded role for the IL17 family
in the proinflammatory immune response.

Shi et al. (2000) cloned a cDNA encoding IL17B, which they initially
designated IL20. The deduced 184-amino acid protein, 88% identical to
the mouse sequence, has a 20-amino acid leader sequence, 1 potential
N-glycosylation site, and 8 cysteine residues. Northern blot analysis
detected a 1.0-kb transcript in spinal cord, testis, and small
intestine, with less pronounced expression in prostate, colon mucosal
lining, and ovary. SDS-PAGE analysis determined that IL17B is expressed
as 23-, 22-, and 18-kD proteins under reducing conditions.
Size-exclusion analysis suggested that IL17B is a nondisulfide-linked
dimer.

GENE FUNCTION

Using BIAcore, flow cytometric, and Western blot analyses, Shi et al.
(2000) showed that IL17B bound with high affinity to IL17RB (605458),
but only poorly to IL17R. Analysis of cultured cells showed that IL17B,
in contrast to IL17, did not activate nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see
164011) or induce production of cytokine message or protein.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Li et al. (2000) mapped the IL17B gene to
chromosome 5q32-q34. However, Shi et al. (2000) mapped the IL17B gene to
chromosome 6p21.2 using somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid
analysis

ANIMAL MODEL

Yamaguchi et al. (2007) used a mouse collagen-induced arthritis (CIA)
model to study the expression and effects of IL17 family members in
arthritis. They detected increased mRNA expression of Il17a, Il17b,
Il17c, Il17d (607587), Il17e (605658), and Il17f (606496) and of their
receptors, Il17ra and Il17rb, in the arthritic paws of CIA mice.
However, Il17a and Il17f were expressed in Cd4 (186940)-positive T
cells, whereas Il17b and Il17c were expressed in cartilage and other
cell populations. Mouse peritoneal cells stimulated with Il17a, Il17b,
Il17c, and Il17f produced Tnf (191160). Adoptive transfer of Il17b- and
Il17c-transduced Cd4-positive T cells exacerbated arthritis after CIA
induction. Treating CIA mice with antibody to IL17b suppressed arthritis
progression and bone destruction. Yamaguchi et al. (2007) concluded
that, in addition to IL17A, IL17B and IL17C also play an important role
in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis.

608760	TITLE *608760 AUTOPHAGY 7, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; ATG7
;;APG7, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, APG7;;
APG7-LIKE; APG7L;;
GSA7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Autophagy is a process of bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components by
the lysosomal/vacuolar system. ATG7 is a ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1
(see 314370)-like protein essential for the Apg12 (ATG12; 609608)
conjugation system that mediates membrane fusion in autophagy (Tanida et
al., 2001).

CLONING

Yuan et al. (1999) identified several APG7L ESTs by searching a database
for sequences similar to P. pastoris Apg7, and they sequenced an APG7L
cDNA from an infant brain cDNA library. The deduced 703-amino acid
protein contains a central putative E1-like ATP-binding site (GxGxxG),
conserved charged amino acids flanking the GxGxxG motif, and a putative
E1 active site with a conserved catalytic cysteine. APG7L shares
similarity with the E1 enzymes UBA2 and UBA3 (UBE1C; 603172), and it
shares 38% identity with yeast Apg7. EST database analysis indicated
that APG7L is expressed by many diverse tissues.

Tanida et al. (2001) found that APG7L expressed by transfected human
embryonic kidney cells had an apparent molecular mass of about 80 kD.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the ATG7 gene to chromosome 3p25.3 based on an
alignment of the ATG7 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC000091) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Tanida et al. (2001) found that APG7L
interacts with APG12L. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that cys572 of
APG7L is an active site cysteine essential for formation of the
APG7L-APG12L intermediate. Overexpression of APG7L enhanced the
formation of the APG5L (ATG5; 604261)-APG12L conjugate, indicating that
APG7L is an E1-like enzyme essential for the APG12 conjugation system.
Cross-linking experiments and glycerol-gradient centrifugation analysis
showed that APG7L forms homodimers. Coimmunoprecipitation studies
indicated that 3 human Apg8 counterparts, GATE16 (GABARAPL2; 607452),
GABARAP (605125), and MAP1ALC3 (601242), also form conjugates with
APG7L. Like E1 enzymes, APG7L carrying a mutation of the active site
cysteine (cys572 to ser) formed a stable intermediate via an O-ester
bond instead of a thioester bond.

Tanida et al. (2002) found that ATG7 coimmunoprecipitated with ATG3
(609606), indicating that ATG3 forms an E1-E2 complex with ATG7, similar
to the yeast Apg3-Apg7 complex.

Yu et al. (2004) defined a novel molecular pathway in which activation
of the receptor-interacting protein (RIP; 603453), a serine-threonine
kinase, and Jun amino-terminal kinase (601158) induced cell death with
the morphology of autophagy. Autophagic death required the genes ATG7
(GSA7) and beclin-1 (604378) and was induced by caspase-8 (601763)
inhibition. Yu et al. (2004) cautioned that clinical therapies involving
caspase inhibitors may arrest apoptosis but also have the unanticipated
effect of promoting autophagic cell death.

Sanjuan et al. (2007) demonstrated that a particle that engages
Toll-like receptors on a murine macrophage while it is phagocytosed
triggers the autophagosome marker LC3 (601242) to be rapidly recruited
to the phagosome in a manner that depends on the autophagy pathway
proteins ATG5 and ATG7; this process is preceded by recruitment of
beclin-1 and phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase activity. Translocation of
beclin-1 and LC3 to the phagosome was not associated with observable
double-membrane structures characteristic of conventional
autophagosomes, but was associated with phagosome fusion with lysosomes,
leading to rapid acidification and enhanced killing of the ingested
organism.

Nishida et al. (2009) showed that mouse cells lacking Atg5 or Atg7 can
still form autophagosomes/autolysosomes and perform autophagy-mediated
protein degradation when subjected to certain stressors. Lipidation of
LC3 to form LC3-II, generally considered to be a good indicator of
macroautophagy, did not occur during the Atg5/Atg7-independent
alternative process of macroautophagy. Nishida et al. (2009) also found
that this alternative process of macroautophagy was regulated by several
autophagic proteins, including Unc51-like kinase-1 (ULK1; 603168) and
beclin-1. Unlike conventional macroautophagy, autophagosomes seemed to
be generated in a Rab9 (300284)-dependent manner by the fusion of
isolation membranes with vesicles derived from the trans-Golgi and late
endosomes. In vivo, Atg5-independent alternative macroautophagy was
detected in several embryonic tissues. It also had a function in
clearing mitochondria during erythroid maturation. Nishida et al. (2009)
concluded that their results indicate that mammalian macroautophagy can
occur through at least 2 different pathways: an Atg5/Atg7-dependent
conventional pathway and an Atg5/Atg7-independent alternative pathway.

Lee et al. (2012) found that starved mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking
the essential autophagy gene product Atg7 failed to undergo cell cycle
arrest. Independent of its E1-like enzymatic activity, Atg7 could bind
to the tumor suppressor p53 (191170) to regulate the transcription of
the gene encoding the cell cycle inhibitor p21(CDKN1A) (116899). With
prolonged metabolic stress, the absence of Atg7 resulted in augmented
DNA damage with increased p53-dependent apoptosis. Inhibition of the DNA
damage response by deletion of the protein kinase Chk2 (604373)
partially rescued postnatal lethality in Atg7 -/- mice. Thus, Lee et al.
(2012) concluded that when nutrients are limited, Atg7 regulates
p53-dependent cell cycle and cell death pathways.

ANIMAL MODEL

Komatsu et al. (2006) reported that loss of ATG7, a gene essential for
autophagy, leads to neurodegeneration. They found that mice lacking Atg7
specifically in the central nervous system showed behavioral defects,
including abnormal limb clasping reflexes and a reduction in coordinated
movement, and died with 28 weeks of birth. Atg7 deficiency caused
massive neuronal loss in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. Notably,
polyubiquitinated proteins accumulated in autophagy-deficient neurons as
inclusion bodies, which increased in size and number with aging. Komatsu
et al. (2006) commented that there was no obvious alteration in
proteasome function. The authors concluded that autophagy is essential
for the survival of neural cells, and that impairment of autophagy is
implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders involving
ubiquitin-containing inclusion bodies.

Komatsu et al. (2007) found that conditional knockout mice with Purkinje
cell-specific deletion of Atg7 developed abnormal axonal swellings and
dystrophy of Purkinje cell axon terminals in the deep cerebellar nuclei.
The distal axons of Purkinje cells in the knockout mice accumulated
aberrant membranous structures that were different from double-membrane
vacuole-like structures found in the distal axons of Purkinje cells from
wildtype animals. The findings indicated impaired autophagic activity in
the axons of mutant cells, which resulted in cell-autonomous axonopathy
and Purkinje cell death. Dendritic spines were comparatively much less
affected. Mutant mice subsequently developed deficits in locomotion and
motor coordination. Komatsu et al. (2007) concluded that autophagy is
required for normal axon terminal membrane trafficking and turnover and
plays an essential role in the maintenance of axonal homeostasis and
prevention of axonal degeneration.

Cadwell et al. (2009) generated mice with a conditional deletion of Atg7
in the intestinal epithelium and observed that the ileal pathology was
indistinguishable from that of mice with disruption of Atg16l1 (610767)
or Atg5: the Paneth cells displayed a reduced number of granules,
dramatically increased cytoplasmic vesicles, abnormal mitochondria, and
lysozyme (153450) with striking defects in distribution including
diffuse cytoplasmic expression. Cadwell et al. (2009) concluded that a
defect in the autophagy pathway in the intestinal epithelium is
responsible for the observed Paneth cell pathology.

300110	TITLE *300110 CALCIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT, ALPHA-1F SUBUNIT; CACNA1F
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The human Xp11.23-p11.22 interval is involved in several hereditary
diseases. Fisher et al. (1997) noted that in constructing YAC contigs
spanning this region, it was found that the region of Xp surrounding the
synaptophysin gene (SYP; 313475) was refractory to cloning in YACs, but
highly stable in cosmids. Preliminary analysis of the cosmid suggested a
high density of coding sequences and prompted complete sequencing of an
SYP-containing cosmid. Fisher et al. (1997) identified 29 putative exons
organized into 3 genes, in addition to the 7 exons of the complete SYP
coding region, all mapping within a 44-kb interval. Two genes were
novel: one (CACNA1F) shows high homology to alpha-1 subunits of calcium
channels (see CACNA2; 114204), whereas the other (LMO6; 300111) encodes
a product with significant similarity to LIM-domain proteins. RT-PCR and
Northern blot studies confirmed that these loci were indeed transcribed.
The third locus (A4; 300112) had been previously described but not
localized to a specific chromosomal site. The region has an elevated GC
content (more than 53%), and Fisher et al. (1997) identified CpG islands
associated with the 5-prime ends of SYP, A4, and LMO6.

Naylor et al. (2000) cloned the mouse Cacna1f gene. The deduced
1,985-amino acid channel protein shares 90% identity with the
1,977-amino acid human protein, with almost perfect conservation between
the functional domains and only a single amino acid substitution within
the transmembrane segments. RT-PCR of several mouse tissues detected
Cacna1f expression only in eye. In situ hybridization detected Cacna1f
in the outer nuclear layer, the inner nuclear layer, and the ganglion
cell layer of mouse retina.

GENE FUNCTION

To study the electrophysiologic and pharmacologic properties of the
L-type calcium channel CACNA1F, Baumann et al. (2004) cloned and
functionally expressed the complete Cacna1f cDNA from the mouse retina.
The data indicated that CACNA1F constitutes the major molecular
correlate of the retinal L-type calcium current. Its intrinsic
biophysical properties, in particular its unique inactivation
properties, enable it to provide a sustained calcium current over the
voltage range required for tonic glutamate release at the photoreceptor
synapse.

Liu et al. (2010) combined electrophysiology to characterize channel
regulation with optical fluorescence resonance energy transfer sensor
determination of free-apocalmodulin (CALM1; 114180) concentration in
live cells. This approach translates quantitative calmodulin
biochemistry from the traditional test-tube context into the realm of
functioning holochannels within intact cells. From this perspective, Liu
et al. (2010) found that long splice forms of Ca(V)1.3 (CACNA1D; 114206)
and Ca(V)1.4 (CACNA1F) channels include a distal carboxy tail that
resembles an enzyme competitive inhibitor that retunes channel affinity
for apocalmodulin such that natural calmodulin variations affect the
strength of Ca(2+) feedback modulation. Given the ubiquity of these
channels, the connection between ambient calmodulin levels and Ca(2+)
entry through channels is broadly significant for Ca(2+) homeostasis.

MAPPING

Fisher et al. (1997) determined that the order of loci in the
Xp11.23-p11.22 interval is Xpter-A4-LMO6-SYP-CACNA1F-Xcen, with
intergenic distances ranging from approximately 300 bp to approximately
5 kb. The density of transcribed sequences in this area (more than 80%)
is comparable to that found in the highly gene-rich band Xq28.

Naylor et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Cacna1f gene to a region of the X
chromosome that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome Xp11.23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Incomplete Congenital Stationary Night Blindness, Type 2A

Conducting mutation analysis in 13 families with the incomplete form of
X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2A; 300071), Strom
et al. (1998) identified 9 different mutations in 10 families, including
3 nonsense and 1 frameshift mutation. Similarly, by mutation analysis of
the CACNA1F gene in 20 families with incomplete CSNB, Bech-Hansen et al.
(1998) found 6 different mutations, all of which predicted premature
protein truncation.

Boycott et al. (2001) summarized 20 CACNA1F mutations that had been
identified in 36 families with incomplete X-linked congenital stationary
night blindness. Three of the mutations accounted for incomplete CSNB in
2 or more families, and a founder effect was demonstrable for one of
these mutations. Of the 20 mutations identified, 14 (70%) were predicted
to cause premature protein truncation and 6 (30%) to cause amino acid
substitutions or deletions at conserved positions in the alpha-1F
protein.

Wutz et al. (2002) reported comprehensive mutation analysis of the 48
exons of the CACNA1F gene in 34 unrelated cases (33 families and 1
sporadic case) diagnosed with the incomplete form of X-linked congenital
stationary night blindness, based on ERG data and dark adaptation tests.
Ten of the families had been partially characterized previously (Strom
et al., 1998). The patients were of German (32), Belgian (1), and French
(1) origin. Mutation analysis was also performed in 2 patients with an
Aland Island disease (300600)-related phenotype. A total of 30 different
mutations (20 of which were novel) were identified in 33 patients, 31
CSNB2 familial cases, and the 2 patients with an AIED-like phenotype.
Reevaluation of the AIED-like phenotype indicated full compatibility of
the patients' ophthalmologic findings with CSNB2. The mutations were
equally distributed over the entire gene sequence and included 13
missense, 8 nonsense, 5 splice site, 3 deletion, and 1 insertion
mutations. RT-PCR experiments in mouse strains with photoreceptor
degeneration showed that the Cacna1f gene is not exclusively expressed
in photoreceptors but in the outer nuclear, the inner nuclear, and the
ganglion cell layer as well.

Nakamura et al. (2003) described 2 Japanese brothers with retinal and
optic disc atrophy and progressive decrease of visual function with
increasing age. Although these clinical features are atypical of
patients with incomplete CSNB, both patients had an in-frame mutation
with deletion and insertion in exon 4 of the CACNA1F gene. In both
patients, the bright flash, mixed rod-cone ERG had a negative
configuration, characteristic of incomplete CSNB. However, the
full-field scotopic and photopic ERGs were nonrecordable, indicating
severe, diffuse retinal malfunction, not typical of incomplete CSNB.
These findings underscored the phenotypic variability of incomplete
CSNB.

Hemara-Wahanui et al. (2005) identified an ile745-to-thr mutation
(I745T; 300110.0006) in the CACNA1F gene in a New Zealand family with a
visual disorder more severe than typical CSNB2.

- Cone-Rod Dystrophy 3

In a large Finnish family with X-linked cone-rod dystrophy-3 (CORDX3;
300476), previously reported by Jalkanen et al. (2003), Jalkanen et al.
(2006) identified a splice site mutation in the CACNA1F gene
(300110.0007).

- Aland Island Eye Disease

In affected members of the original family with Aland Island eye disease
(300600) described by Forsius and Eriksson (1964), Jalkanen et al.
(2007) identified homozygosity for a 425-bp deletion mutation
encompassing exon 30 and portions of adjacent introns of the CACN1F gene
(300110.0008). The mutation was found in heterozygous state in carrier
females of this family and was not found in samples from 121 Finnish
male control subjects.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mansergh et al. (2005) generated a mouse with a loss-of-function
mutation in exon 7 of the mouse Cacna1f gene. Electroretinography of the
mutant mouse revealed a scotopic a-wave of marginally reduced amplitude
compared with the wildtype mouse and absence of the postreceptoral
b-wave and oscillatory potentials. Cone ERG responses together with
visual evoked potentials and multi-unit activity in the superior
colliculus were also absent. Calcium imaging of retinal slices
depolarized with KCl showed 90% less peak signal in the photoreceptor
synapses of the Cacna1f mutant than in wildtype mice. The absence of
postreceptoral ERG responses and the diminished photoreceptor calcium
signals were consistent with a loss of Ca(2+) channel function in
photoreceptors. Immunocytochemistry showed no detectable Cav1.4 protein
in the outer plexiform layer of Cacna1f-mutant mice, profound loss of
photoreceptor synapses, and abnormal dendritic sprouting of second-order
neurons in the photoreceptor layer. Mansergh et al. (2005) concluded
that the Cav1.4 calcium channel is vital for the functional assembly
and/or maintenance and synaptic functions of photoreceptor ribbon
synapses.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A
CACNA1F, GLY369ASP

One of the missense mutations identified by Strom et al. (1998) in cases
of incomplete X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2A;
300071) was a gly369-to-asp (G369D) amino acid substitution resulting
from a transition of nucleotide 1106 in exon 8.

.0002
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A
CACNA1F, ARG958TER

One of the nonsense mutations identified in families with incomplete
X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2A; 300071) by Strom
et al. (1998) was an arg958-to-ter (R958X) mutation due to a C-to-T
transition of nucleotide 2172 in exon 24.

.0003
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A
CACNA1F, 1-BP INS, 991C

In 15 CSNB2A (300071) families with the common Mennonite haplotype,
suggesting that these families share a founder mutation (Boycott et al.
(1998)), Bech-Hansen et al. (1998) found insertion of a single C
nucleotide at codon 991 for leucine (L991insC). The insertion caused a
frameshift with stop codon 1001.

.0004
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A
CACNA1F, ARG830TER

Among families with CSNB2A (300071), one of the truncating mutations
found by Bech-Hansen et al. (1998) was a C-to-T transition in exon 21 of
the CACNA1F gene, resulting in an arg830-to-ter (R830X) nonsense amino
acid change.

.0005
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A
CACNA1F, 1-BP DEL, 4548C

In 2 affected members of a French family segregating X-linked congenital
stationary night blindness type 2, Jacobi et al. (2003) identified a
1-bp deletion (C) at nucleotide 4548 in the CACNA1F gene, resulting in a
frameshift with a predicted premature termination at codon 1524.

.0006
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A, SEVERE
CACNA1F, ILE745THR

Hemara-Wahanui et al. (2005) identified a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 2234 in exon 17 of the CACNA1F gene in a New Zealand family
with a retinal disorder similar to, but more severe than, X-linked
congenital stationary night blindness-2 (CSNB2A; 300071). The transition
resulted in the substitution of a conserved isoleucine with threonine at
residue 745 (I745T) within transmembrane segment IIS6. Affected males
had congenital nystagmus, decreased visual acuity, frequent
hypermetropia, and normal fundi. Female family members had congenital
nystagmus, decreased visual acuity, and frequent high myopia, in
contrast to typical CSNB2A families, in which female heterozygotes are
unaffected. Electroretinography showed CSNB2A-like features in males and
similar, but less severe, features in females. In addition, some
visually impaired males had intellectual impairment and were autistic.
Hemara-Wahanui et al. (2005) found that the I745T mutation caused
altered channel activity following expression in human embryonic kidney
cells. The channel showed a dramatic shift of about -30 mV in the
voltage dependence of activation and significantly slower inactivation
kinetics. Hemara-Wahanui et al. (2005) concluded that the I745T mutation
increases the number of mutant channels open at physiologic membrane
potential and allows for persistent Ca(2+) entry due to reduced channel
inactivation, resulting in a gain-of-function defect.

.0007
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY, X-LINKED, 3
CACNA1F, 5-BP DEL/3-BP INS

In a large Finnish family with X-linked cone-rod dystrophy-3 (CORDX3;
300476), previously reported by Jalkanen et al. (2003), Jalkanen et al.
(2006) identified a deletion/insertion (IVS28-1 GCGTC-TGG) at -1
position in the splice acceptor site of intron 28 of the CACNA1F gene.
The mutation cosegregated completely with the disease phenotype in the
family, which included 7 affected males, 10 carrier females, and 33
unaffected family members; it was not found in 200 control chromosomes.
RNA studies revealed that the mutation caused altered splicing of the
CACNA1F transcript, resulting in 5 variants with predicted premature
termination and exonic deletions of the encoded protein.

.0008
ALAND ISLAND EYE DISEASE
CACNA1F, 425-BP DEL

In affected members of the original family with Aland Island eye disease
(300600) described by Forsius and Eriksson (1964), Jalkanen et al.
(2007) identified homozygosity for a 425-bp deletion mutation
encompassing exon 30 and portions of adjacent introns of the CACN1F
gene. The mutation was found in heterozygous state in carrier females of
this family and was not found in samples from 121 Finnish male control
subjects. The mutation is predicted to cause a deletion of the
transmembrane domain IVS2 and the preceding extracellular loop and
consequently an altered membrane topology for the C-terminal part of the
protein.

605581	TITLE *605581 BETA-1,3-N-ACETYLGLUCOSYAMINYLTRANSFERASE 2; B3GNT2
;;BETA-1,3-N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINYLTRANSFERASE 1, FORMERLY; B3GNT1, FORMERLY;;
B3GNT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

B3GNT2 encodes a poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthase enzyme (EC 2.4.1.149)
that catalyzes both the initiation and elongation of N-acetyllactosamine
chains (Zhou et al., 1999).

CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to beta-3 GalT enzymes,
PCR, and probing a fetal brain cDNA library, Zhou et al. (1999) isolated
a cDNA encoding B3GNT2, which they called B3GNT. In an erratum, the
authors noted that a laboratory designation error resulted in the
publication of the sequence and expression pattern of B3GNT6 (615291) in
the original paper instead of those of B3GNT2. The correct B3GNT2
sequence, published in the erratum, encodes a 397-amino acid protein
that is 87% identical to the 397-amino acid mouse protein. B3GNT2
contains 3 potential N-glycosylation sites and 3 conserved cysteines.
Northern blot analysis detected a single major 3.3-kb B3GNT2 transcript
that was ubiquitously expressed.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analysis by Zhou et al. (1999) showed that B3GNT had a marked
preference for Gal(beta1-4)GlcNAc-based acceptors, whereas it had no
activity on type-1 Gal(beta1-3)GlcNAc or O-glycan core-1
Gal(beta1-3)GalNAc acceptors. B3GNT could both initiate and elongate
poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains, activities that confirmed its identity
with poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthase (EC 2.4.1.149).

Seko and Yamashita (2008) stated that a mixture of soluble forms of
B3GNT2 and B3GNT8 (615337) in vitro had increased enzymatic activity
over that shown for either enzyme alone (Seko and Yamashita, 2005). By
coimmunoprecipitation analysis they found that the 2 enzymes interacted
in transfected COS-7 cells. Mutation in the DDD motif of B3GNT2 or QDD
motif of B3GNT8 inactivated the enzymes but did not abrogate their
interaction. Mixing active and inactive enzymes revealed that the
activity of B3GNT2, but not B3GNT8, was increased by the interaction.
B3GNT8 did not alter the substrate specificity of B3GNT2, but augmented
its turnover velocity. Murine B3gnt8 also activated human B3GNT2, and
human B3GNT8 activated murine B3gnt2, indicating conservation of effect.
Levels of both B3GNT8 and poly-N-acetyllactosamine (polyLacNAc) moieties
increased in differentiated HL-60 cells. Overexpression of either active
or inactive B3GNT8, but not B3GNT2, increased polyLacNAc content in
differentiated HL-60 cells, suggesting that exogenous B3GNT8 activated
preexisting free B3GNT2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhou et al. (1999) noted that the GC content of the human and mouse
B3GNT2 genes is elevated, at 75% and 67%, respectively.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the B3GNT2 gene to chromosome 2p15 based on an
alignment of the B3GNT2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB049584) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Togayachi et al. (2010) stated that the mouse B3gnt2 gene maps to
chromosome 11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Togayachi et al. (2010) observed a reduced number of repeating
polylactosamine chains on N-glycans in tissues of B3gnt2 -/- mice.
N-glycan core structures were unaltered. B3gnt2 -/- splenic T cells
showed hyperactivation with prolonged calcium influx upon T-cell
receptor (see 186830) stimulation, resulting in an elevated
proliferative response. B3gnt2 -/- B cells also exhibited
hyperproliferation upon B-cell receptor (see 147020) stimulation.
Togayachi et al. (2010) concluded that B3GNT2 encodes a major
polylactosamine synthase and that the lack of polylactosamine repeats on
B3gnt2 -/- mouse lymphocyte receptor molecules results in lymphocyte
hyperactivation.

606428	TITLE *606428 UDP-GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE 1 FAMILY, POLYPEPTIDE A3; UGT1A3
;;UGT1C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Enzymes of the UDP glycosyltransferase (UGT; EC 2.4.1.17) superfamily
covalently link glycosyl groups to lipophilic substrates. UGT1A enzymes,
such as UGT1A3, efficiently use UDP-glucuronic acid as the glycosyl
donor and are invaluable in detoxifying both endogenous and foreign
chemicals, because the glycosylated chemical is more water soluble and
therefore more readily excreted. Several UGT1A enzymes, including
UGT1A3, are encoded by the UGT1A gene complex on chromosome 2q37. Within
this complex, 9 viable first exons are independently spliced to 4 common
exons to generate 9 UGT1A transcripts with unique 5-prime ends and
identical 3-prime ends. UGT1A3, like each first exon within the UGT1A
gene complex, is considered a unique gene linked to the 4 common exons
(Gong et al., 2001; Mackenzie et al., 2005). See 191740 for further
information on the UGT1A gene complex.

CLONING

By screening a colon cDNA library, followed by RT-PCR of liver mRNA,
Mojarrabi et al. (1996) obtained a cDNA encoding UGT1A3. The deduced
534-amino acid protein has 5 potential N-glycosylation sites and its
first exon is identical to that of UGT1 exon 1c (Ritter et al., 1992).
Expression in COS-7 cells revealed a major protein of 55 kD. By RT-PCR
analysis, Mojarrabi et al. (1996) detected expression of UGT1A3 in human
liver and colon.

GENE FUNCTION

Expression of UGT1A3 in COS-7 cells by Mojarrabi et al. (1996) revealed
glucuronidation activity toward estrone, 2-hydroxyestrone, and
metabolites of benzo[a]pyrene.

MAPPING

Using DNA probes prepared from the 5-prime terminal portion of 4 cDNA
clones for UGT1 and a sequence common to all 4 clones isolated from the
3-prime terminal portion of one of the clones, Moghrabi et al. (1992)
analyzed a panel of 16 human/rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs by Southern
blot analysis to locate the gene on chromosome 2.

605802	TITLE *605802 ZINC FINGER E BOX-BINDING HOMEOBOX 2; ZEB2
;;ZINC FINGER HOMEOBOX 1B; ZFHX1B;;
SMAD-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; SMADIP1;;
SIP1;;
KIAA0569
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ZEB2 gene is a member of the ZEB1 (189909)/Drosophila Zfh1 family of
2-handed zinc finger/homeodomain proteins and functions as a DNA-binding
transcriptional repressor that interacts with activated SMADs (see
601595), the transducers of TGF-beta (190180) signaling, and interacts
with the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation (NURD) complex
(Verstappen et al., 2008).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned ZEB2, which they designated
KIAA0569. The deduced 1,214-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with rat Zeb1. RT-PCR analysis of human tissues detected
highest ZEB2 expression in heart, brain, lung, placenta, and kidney,
with moderate expression in ovary, skeletal muscle, liver, and small
intestine.

Using the yeast 2-hybrid analysis of mouse embryos, Verschueren et al.
(1999) identified Zeb2, which they called Smadip1. The Smadip1 protein
contains a SMAD-binding domain, a homeodomain-like sequence, and 2
separate clusters of zinc fingers, one N-terminal and the other
C-terminal.

Comparison of human and mouse homologs of ZEB2 at nucleotide and amino
acid levels revealed 93% and 97% similarities, respectively (Wakamatsu
et al., 2001).

By immunohistochemical analysis of mouse embryos, Seuntjens et al.
(2009) found that Sip1 was expressed in the cortical plate, but not in
neural progenitor cells. In the medial/cingulate cortex at late
gestation (embryonic day 18.5), Sip1 expression was restricted to cells
of the deep cortical layers.

GENE STRUCTURE

The ZEB2 gene spans approximately 70 kb and consists of 10 exons
(Wakamatsu et al., 2001).

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the ZEB2 gene
to chromosome 2. Wakamatsu et al. (2001) mapped the ZEB2 gene to
chromosome 2q22.

GENE FUNCTION

Verschueren et al. (1999) found that, although SMADIP1 interacted with
the MH2 domain of receptor-regulated SMADs in yeast and in vitro, its
interaction with full-length SMADs (see 601595) in mammalian cells
required receptor-mediated SMAD activation. Like delta-EF1, SMADIP1
bound to 5-prime-CACCT sequences in different promoters, including the
Xenopus 'brachyury' (Xbra) promoter (Remacle et al., 1999).
Overexpression of either full-length SMADIP1 or its C-terminal zinc
finger cluster, which bound to the Xbra2 promoter in vitro, prevented
expression of the endogenous Xbra gene in early Xenopus embryos.
Therefore, SMADIP1 is likely to be a transcriptional repressor that may
be involved in the regulation of at least 1 immediate response gene for
activin-dependent signal transduction pathways. Verschueren et al.
(1999) concluded that identification of this SMAD-interacting protein
opens routes to investigate the mechanisms by which TGF-beta (190180)
members exert their effects on expression of target genes in responsive
cells and in the vertebrate embryo.

Comijn et al. (2001) reported that expression of wildtype but not
mutated SIP1 downregulated mammalian E-cadherin (192090) transcription
via binding to both conserved E2 boxes of the minimal E-cadherin
promoter. SIP1 and Snail (SNAI1; 604238) bound to partly overlapping
promoter sequences and showed similar silencing effects. SIP1 could be
induced by TGFB treatment and showed high expression in several
E-cadherin-negative human carcinoma cell lines. Conditional expression
of SIP1 in E-cadherin-positive MDCK cells abrogated E-cadherin-mediated
intercellular adhesion and simultaneously induced invasion. The authors
concluded that SIP1 therefore appears to be a promoter of invasion in
malignant epithelial tumors.

To explore telomerase regulation, Lin and Elledge (2003) employed a
general genetic screen in HeLa cells to identify negative regulators of
TERT (187270). They discovered 3 tumor suppressor/oncogene pathways
involved in TERT repression, including SIP1, which mediates
TGF-beta-regulated repression of TERT.

Vandewalle et al. (2005) showed that expression of mouse Sip1 in human
epithelial cells caused a morphologic change from an epithelial to a
mesenchymal phenotype. Dedifferentiation was accompanied by repression
of several cell junction proteins and their corresponding mRNAs. In
addition to E-cadherin, other genes encoding crucial proteins of tight
junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions were downregulated by Sip1.
Reporter gene assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated
direct repression of promoters of some of these genes by Sip1.

TGF-beta is a key regulator of extracellular matrix collagens in
mesangial cells (MCs) in diabetic nephropathy. Kato et al. (2007) found
that TGF-beta increased miR192 (MIRN192; 610939) levels in primary mouse
MCs, and they identified Sip1 as a target of miR192 in mouse MCs.
TGF-beta treatment or transfection with miR192 decreased expression of
endogenous Sip1 and activity of a reporter construct containing the
3-prime UTR of Sip1. Conversely, inhibition of miR192 enhanced reporter
activity, confirming Sip1 to be an miR192 target. Glomeruli isolated
from streptozotocin-injected diabetic mice and diabetic db/db mice (see
601007) showed elevated miR192 levels relative to corresponding
nondiabetic controls, which paralleled increased Tgf-beta and Col1a2
(120160) expression. Transfection of mouse MCs with miR192 and short
hairpin RNAs targeting delta-EF1 synergistically enhanced activity of a
reporter construct containing upstream E-box elements of the Col1a2
gene. Kato et al. (2007) concluded that TGF-beta-mediated collagen
regulation in MCs involves crosstalk between miR192 and the E-box
repressors delta-EF1 and SIP1.

Expression of SNAI1 in epithelial cells triggers an
epithelial-mesenchyme transition. Beltran et al. (2008) showed that
synthesis of ZEB2 was upregulated following SNAI1 expression in human
cell lines. SNAI1 did not alter ZEB2 mRNA levels, but it prevented
processing of a large intron in the 5-prime UTR of ZEB2 that contains an
internal ribosome entry site (IRES) necessary for ZEB2 expression.
Maintenance of the 5-prime ZEB2 intron was dependent on expression of an
antisense transcript that overlapped the 5-prime splice site in the
intron. Ectopic overexpression of this antisense transcript in
epithelial cells prevented splicing of the ZEB2 5-prime UTR, resulting
in elevated ZEB2 protein expression and, consequently, downregulation of
E-cadherin mRNA and protein.

Park et al. (2008) found that expression of the miR200 family of
microRNAs (e.g., MIRN200A; 612090) in human cell lines was associated
with an epithelial phenotype and with expression of E-cadherin, an
epithelial cell marker. They identified multiple miR200 target sequences
in the 3-prime UTRs of the E-cadherin transcriptional repressors ZEB1
and ZEB2. Using the 3-prime UTRs of mouse and human ZEB1 and ZEB2, they
showed that endogenous miR200s suppressed ZEB1 and ZEB2 expression.
Increasing miR200 levels induced mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition
(MET) in human cancer cell lines, reducing their aggressiveness.
Conversely, reducing miR200 levels induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT). Park et al. (2008) concluded that the miR200 family
regulates EMT/MET by targeting ZEB1 and ZEB2, which control expression
of E-cadherin.

Using mass spectrometry, Verstappen et al. (2008) found that ZEB2
associated with multiple subunits of the NURD complex, which plays a key
role in transcriptional repression. Mi2-beta (CHD4; 603277) was
identified as a specific cofactor for ZEB2-mediated repression of
E-cadherin (CDH1; 192090). The N-terminal 289 amino acids of ZEB2 were
sufficient for interaction with NURD complex subunits. In vitro studies
in Xenopus oocytes showed broad Zeb2 expression at the gastrula stage,
with stronger expression in neural tissues and neural crest cells at the
neurula stage, suggesting a role in neural development. Endogenous
Mi2-beta expression broadly overlapped Zeb2 expression, and antisense
morpholino knockdown of Mi2-beta resulted in reduced Zeb2-mediated
repression of Bmp4 (112262) and decreased induction of neural marker
Ncam (116930). Further studies showed that a mutant ZEB2 protein
(605802.0014), differing in the first 24 amino acids from the wildtype
protein and causing a mild form of Mowat-Wilson syndrome (235730), was
unable to interact with the NURD complex and showed decreased
transcriptional repression of Bmp4.

Uterine quiescence during pregnancy is mediated by increased
progesterone, which represses factors involved in contraction. Renthal
et al. (2010) identified MIRN200 family members (MIRN200B, 612091;
MIRN429, 612094) as microRNAs that mediate myometrial transition to a
contractile phenotype. In human and mouse uterus during pregnancy,
Renthal et al. (2010) found that ZEB1 and ZEB2 were transcriptional
repressors of the contraction-associated genes connexin-43 (GJA1;
121014) and the oxytocin receptor (OXTR; 167055) in myometrial cells.
ZEB1 was directly upregulated by progesterone at the ZEB1 promoter.
During preterm labor in mice, there was an unregulation of
Mirn200b/Mirn429, which downregulated Zeb1 and Zeb2, resulting in
derepression of transcription of the contractility-associated proteins.
In addition, Zeb1 was found to directly bind and repress
Mirn200b/Mirn429, indicating a feedback mechanism. The findings
implicated MIRN200B/MIRN429 and their targets, ZEB1 and ZEB2, as unique
progesterone-mediated regulators of uterine quiescence and contractility
during pregnancy and labor.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with Hirschsprung disease associated with microcephaly,
mental retardation, hypertelorism, submucous cleft palate, and short
stature, consistent with Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MOWS; 235730), Wakamatsu
et al. (2001) identified nonsense or frameshift mutations in the SMADIP1
gene. These mutations represented null alleles, suggesting that
haploinsufficiency for SMADIP1 is sufficient to cause this phenotype.
Wakamatsu et al. (2001) found that the SMADIP1 gene resides in a segment
on 2q22 deleted in 3 patients with the Hirschsprung disease-mental
retardation syndrome. They concluded that the SMADIP1 gene appears to be
essential to embryonic neural and neural crest development.

To investigate the breadth of clinical variation associated with
mutations in ZFHX1B, Yamada et al. (2001) studied DNA samples from 6
patients with clinical features similar to those described for ZFHX1B
deficiency, except that they did not have Hirschsprung disease. The
results showed the R695X mutation (605802.0002) to be present in 3
cases, with 3 novel mutations being identified in the other 3 patients.
All mutations occurred in 1 allele and were de novo events. The results
demonstrated that ZFHX1B deficiency is an autosomal dominant complex
developmental disorder and that individuals with functional null
mutations present with mental retardation, delayed motor development,
epilepsy, and a wide spectrum of clinically heterogeneous features
suggestive of neurocristopathies at the cephalic, cardiac, and vagal
levels.

Amiel et al. (2001) found that 8 of 19 patients with Hirschsprung
disease and mental retardation had large-scale ZFHX1B deletions or
truncating mutations. These results allowed further delineation of the
spectrum of malformations ascribed to haploinsufficiency of this gene,
which includes frequent features such as hypospadias and agenesis of the
corpus callosum. Thus, the ZFHX1B gene, which encodes a transcriptional
corepressor of Smad target genes, may play a role not only in the
patterning of neural crest-derived cells and of the central nervous
system but also in the development of midline structures in humans.

Zweier et al. (2002) analyzed the ZFHX1B gene in 5 patients, 3 of whom
had Hirschsprung disease syndrome, 2 with and 1 without the facial
phenotype described by Mowat et al. (1998), and 2 of whom had the
distinct facial gestalt without Hirschsprung disease. Zweier et al.
(2002) excluded large deletions in all 5 patients and found truncating
ZFHX1B mutations (605802.0007-605802.0010) in all 4 patients with the
characteristic facial phenotype but not in the patient with syndromic
Hirschsprung disease without the distinct facial appearance. Zweier et
al. (2002) suggested the name Mowat-Wilson syndrome (235730) for the
clinical entity of distinct facial appearance, mental retardation, and
variable multiple congenital anomalies (MCA).

Ishihara et al. (2004) identified 5 novel nonsense and frameshift
mutations in the ZFHX1B gene in patients with Mowat-Wilson syndrome and
characterized the clinical features and molecular basis of a total of 27
cases with mutations or deletions in ZFHX1B. All of the deletions were
of paternal origin, and clinical features in cases with deletions of up
to about 5 Mb overlapped those found in cases with nonsense and
frameshift mutations. However, 2 of their patients with large deletions
(10.42 Mb and 8.83 Mb) had significantly delayed psychomotor
development, and 1 of them also had a cleft palate and complicated heart
disease, features not previously reported in patients with Mowat-Wilson
syndrome.

Zweier et al. (2006) reported a 5-year-old boy with a facial gestalt
similar to that seen in Mowat-Wilson syndrome but who exhibited an
unusually mild phenotype and in whom they identified heterozygosity for
a splice site mutation in the ZFHX1B gene (605802.0014).

Heinritz et al. (2006) described a 2.5-year-old boy with a heterozygous
missense mutation in the ZFHX1B gene (605802.0015) who had bilateral
cleft lip and palate and brachytelephalangy, features unusual in
Mowat-Wilson syndrome.

Dastot-Le Moal et al. (2007) stated that more than 110 different
mutations in the ZEB2 gene had been described. Nonsense mutations
accounted for approximately 41% of the known punctual mutations and were
localized mainly in exon 8. No obvious genotype-phenotype correlations
had been observed.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

The majority of ZEB2 mutations identified in patients with Mowat-Wilson
syndrome lead to haploinsufficiency through premature termination or
large gene deletions. In 3 unrelated patients with a mild form of MOWS,
Ghoumid et al. (2013) identified 3 different missense mutations in the
ZEB2 gene (see, e.g., S1071P, 605802.0016 and H1045R, 605802.0017). All
3 mutations occurred in the conserved C-terminal zinc finger cluster
domain. In vitro functional expression studies showed that these 3
missense mutations lost the ability to bind to the E-cadherin (CDH1;
192090) promoter and to repress transcription of this target gene,
consistent with a loss of function and without a dominant-negative
effect. However, these mutant mRNAs showed significant phenotypic rescue
of morpholino knockout zebrafish embryos: complete rescue with S1071P
(84%) and partial rescue with H1045R (55%), indicating that they are
hypomorphic alleles; wildtype mRNA showed 81% rescue. The patients had
mild facial gestalt of MOWS and moderate intellectual disability, but no
microcephaly, heart defects, or HSCR. The variable embryonic rescue
correlated with the severity of the patients' phenotype.

ANIMAL MODEL

To clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical features of
Hirschsprung disease-mental retardation syndrome, Van de Putte et al.
(2003) generated mice that carried a Zfhx1b mutation comparable to those
found in several human patients. They showed that Zfhx1b knockout mice
did not develop postotic vagal neural crest cells, the precursors of the
enteric nervous system that is affected in patients with Hirschsprung
disease, and displayed a delamination arrest of cranial neural crest
cells, which form the skeletomuscular elements of the vertebral head.
This suggests that the gene product is essential for the development of
vagal neural crest precursors and the migratory behavior of cranial
neural crest in the mouse. Furthermore, they showed that the gene
product is involved in the specification of neuroepithelium.
Sip1-knockout embryos died around embryonic day 9.5, with failed neural
tube closure, lack of a sharp boundary between the neural plate and the
rest of the ectoderm, and lack of the first branchial arch.

Van de Putte et al. (2007) found that conditional deletion of Zeb2 in
mouse neural crest precursors was embryonic lethal. Mutant mice
displayed craniofacial and gastrointestinal malformations similar to
those of patients with Mowat-Wilson syndrome. In addition, mutant mice
had defects in the heart, melanoblasts, and sympathetic and
parasympathetic anlagen.

A single layer of neuroepithelial cells lining the embryonic neural tube
gives rise to the entire repertoire of neurons, astrocytes, and
oligodendrocytes in the adult central nervous system. Seuntjens et al.
(2009) found that conditional Sip1 deletion in young mouse neurons
induced premature production of upper layer neurons at the expense of
deep layers, precocious and increased generation of glial precursors,
and elevated numbers of astrocytes at early postnatal stages. Microarray
analysis showed that Ntf3 (162660) and Fgf9 (600921) were over- and
prematurely expressed in mutant brains. In the absence of Sip1, there
was also a premature peak of MAPK (see 176948) signaling in neural
progenitor cells. Seuntjens et al. (2009) concluded that SIP1 functions
in the postmitotic compartment of the neocortex to control the
expression of growth factor genes that feed back to progenitors to
regulate production of the neurons and glial cells required for
corticogenesis.

Ghoumid et al. (2013) found that morpholino knockout of the zebrafish
Zeb2 ortholog sip1b in zebrafish embryos resulted in severe
neurodevelopmental abnormalities, including small brains and defects of
tectum development, as well as impaired neuronal crest cell migration
with a lack of development of pharyngeal arches and jaw cartilages.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MOWAT-WILSON SYNDROME
ZEB2, ARG549TER

In a patient with Hirschsprung disease associated with microcephaly,
mental retardation, hypertelorism, submucous cleft palate, and short
stature (235730), Wakamatsu et al. (2001) identified an A-to-T
transversion at nucleotide 1645 of the SMADIP1 gene, resulting in an
arg-to-ter substitution at codon 549 (R549X).

.0002
MOWAT-WILSON SYNDROME
ZEB2, ARG695TER

In a patient with Hirschsprung disease associated with microcephaly,
mental retardation, hypertelorism, submucous cleft palate, and short
stature (235730), Wakamatsu et al. (2001) identified a C-to-T transition
at nucleotide 2083 of the SMADIP1 gene, resulting in an arg-to-ter
substitution at codon 695 (R695X).

In a study of 6 patients with clinical features similar to those
reported in patients with ZFHX1B mutations but without Hirschsprung
disease, Yamada et al. (2001) found that 3 had the R695X mutation. Thus,
Hirschsprung disease is not a consistent feature.

.0003
MOWAT-WILSON SYNDROME
ZEB2, 4-BP DEL, NT1173

In a patient with Hirschsprung disease associated with microcephaly and
mental retardation, hypertelorism, submucous cleft palate, and short
stature (235730), Wakamatsu et al. (2001) identified a 4-bp deletion
(AACA) at nucleotide 1173 of the SMADIP1 gene, resulting in a frameshift
at codon 392 leading to a termination codon at amino acid residue 394 in
exon 8.

.0004
MOWAT-WILSON SYNDROME
ZEB2, 1-BP INS, 1421A

In a patient with Hirschsprung disease associated with microcephaly and
mental retardation, hypertelorism, submucous cleft palate, and short
stature (235730) originally reported by Mowat et al. (1998), Cacheux et
al. (2001) identified insertion of an adenine residue following
nucleotide 1421 of the SMADIP1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and
leading to a termination codon at amino acid residue 481 in exon 8.

.0005
MOWAT-WILSON SYNDROME
ZEB2, 2-BP INS, 760CA

In a 25-year-old male patient with many features of the Hirschsprung
disease-mental retardation syndrome but without Hirschsprung disease
(235730), Yamada et al. (2001) found a 2-bp insertion (760insCA) in the
ZFHX1B gene. The patient showed hypertelorism and microcephaly (head
circumference 2 standard deviations below the mean) at birth. He
developed epilepsy at age 1 year. He showed delayed motor development,
with neck control developing at age 8 months and walking without support
at age 2 years. He was severely mentally retarded, with only a few words
of speech.

.0006
MOWAT-WILSON SYNDROME
ZEB2, 1-BP INS, 2453T

In a patient with Hirschsprung disease-mental retardation syndrome
(235730), Amiel et al. (2001) found a 1-bp insertion (2453insT) in the
ZFHX1B gene. The patient had the characteristic facies, with sunken
eyes, downslanting palpebral fissures, strabismus, thick eyebrows with
lateral flaring, saddle nose, pointed chin, thick antehelix, and rotated
ears with uplifted, fleshy earlobes. The patient did not have agenesis
of the corpus callosum but did have hydronephrosis as well as heart
defects: atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects, and pulmonic
stenosis.

.0007
MOWAT-WILSON SYNDROME
ZEB2, 1-BP DEL, 1892A

In a patient with Hirschsprung disease-mental retardation syndrome
(235730), Zweier et al. (2002) found a heterozygous 1-bp deletion
(1892delA) in exon 8 of the ZFHX1B gene, resulting in a premature stop
codon after 14 amino acids.

.0008
MOWAT-WILSON SYNDROME
ZEB2, 2-BP INS, 553TG

In a patient with many features of the Hirschsprung disease-mental
retardation syndrome (235730) but without Hirschsprung disease, Zweier
et al. (2002) found a heterozygous 2-bp insertion in exon 5 in the
ZFHX1B gene, leading to a stop codon after 27 amino acids. To
investigate if this truncating mutation led to mRNA decay, Zweier et al.
(2002) performed RT-PCR of mRNA from the patient's peripheral blood and
found the mutated transcript.

.0009
MOWAT-WILSON SYNDROME
ZEB2, SER852TER

In a patient with many features of the Hirschsprung disease-mental
retardation syndrome (235730) but without Hirschsprung disease, Zweier
et al. (2002) found a heterozygous C-to-G substitution in exon 8 of the
ZFHX1B gene, resulting in a ser852-to-ter substitution.

.0010
MOWAT-WILSON SYNDROME
ZEB2, 2-BP INS, 3567CC

In a patient with Hirschsprung disease-mental retardation syndrome
(235730), Zweier et al. (2002) found a heterozygous 2-bp insertion
(3567insCC) in exon 10, resulting in a frameshift and an enlarged
protein of 1,241 amino acids.

.0011
HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE-MENTAL RETARDATION SYNDROME, LATE INFANTILE
ZEB2, 3-BP DEL, 295AAC

Yoneda et al. (2002) reported a 48-year-old woman with late
infantile-onset mental retardation who developed megacolon. Although the
patient had no typical clinical features of Hirschsprung disease-mental
retardation syndrome (235730), a 3-bp deletion eliminating asn99 was
identified in exon 3 of the ZFHX1B gene. The woman was born of
nonconsanguineous parents. She was noted to have mental retardation but
received a full education in elementary school. She sometimes had
constipation but did not require medication until age 48 years, when she
presented with severe constipation and was found to have megacolon. This
patient would appear to represent an intermediate stage between the
full-blown Hirschsprung disease-mental retardation syndrome and
Hirschsprung disease-mental retardation syndrome without Hirschsprung
disease.

.0012
MOWAT-WILSON SYNDROME
ZEB2, 300-KB DEL

In a patient with typical features of Mowat-Wilson syndrome (235730),
Zweier et al. (2003) described a deletion of approximately 300 kb on
chromosome 2q22, encompassing the ZFHX1B gene, as defined by FISH and
marker analysis. The patient was pictured at age 10 years with a facial
gestalt typical of Mowat-Wilson syndrome. Birth weight and length were
at the 90th centile. He had ventricular septal defect and pulmonary
stenosis. He was described as being affectionate and happy.

.0013
MOWAT-WILSON SYNDROME
ZEB2, 1-BP DEL, 1862T

In a sister and brother with Mowat-Wilson syndrome (235730), McGaughran
et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (1862delT)
in exon 8 of the ZFHX1B gene, resulting in a stop codon at position 645
and predicting a truncated protein missing the homeodomain and the
C-terminal zinc finger domain. The mutation was not found in the
unaffected parents' lymphocyte-derived DNA, suggesting germline
mosaicism in the sibs. McGaughran et al. (2005) stated that this was the
first report of a sib recurrence of Mowat-Wilson syndrome.

.0014
MOWAT-WILSON SYNDROME
ZEB2, IVS1AS, G-A, -1

In a 5-year-old boy with a facial gestalt of Mowat-Wilson syndrome
(235730) and an unusually mild phenotype, Zweier et al. (2006)
identified heterozygosity for a G-to-A transition at the -1 position in
the splice acceptor site of exon 2 of the ZFHX1B gene (alternatively,
-70G-A), predicted to result in skipping of exon 2 including the start
codon. The aberrant transcript contains an alternative upstream start
codon, resulting in a mutant protein differing only for the first 24
amino acids from the wildtype protein. The mutation was excluded in both
parents, revealing its de novo origin. The patient's facial gestalt was
less striking than the majority of MWS patients, and his psychomotor
development was much better than expected in classic MWS. Except for
increased disposition for seizures on EEG and body measurements at the
third centile, he showed no other anomalies frequently observed in MWS.

Verstappen et al. (2008) showed the protein resulting from the -70G-A
mutation was unable to interact with the NURD complex, which plays a key
role in transcriptional repression, as well as decreased transcriptional
repression of Bmp4 (112262). The findings were important because they
demonstrated the effect of aberrant function of a single domain of the
ZEB2 protein, which resulted in a relatively milder phenotype compared
to complete haploinsufficiency.

.0015
MOWAT-WILSON SYNDROME
ZEB2, GLN1119ARG

In a 2.5-year-old boy with the overall facial phenotype of Mowat-Wilson
syndrome (235730) but with cleft lip and palate and lacking the
characteristic eyebrows, Heinritz et al. (2006) identified
heterozygosity for a de novo 3356A-G transition in exon 10 of the ZFHX1B
gene, resulting in a gln1119-to-arg (Q1119R) substitution. The patient
also had brachytelephalangy, which the authors stated had never been
described before in Mowat-Wilson syndrome.

.0016
MOWAT-WILSON SYNDROME
ZEB2, SER1071PRO

In a boy with a relatively mild form of Mowat-Wilson syndrome (235730),
Ghoumid et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous c.3211T-C transition in
the ZEB2 gene, resulting in a ser1071-to-pro (S1071P) substitution at a
highly conserved residue in the C-terminal zinc finger domain. The
mutation was not present in the mother, in 200 control chromosomes, or
in SNP databases; DNA from the father was not available. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the mutant protein lost the
ability to bind to the E-cadherin (CDH1; 192090) promoter and to repress
transcription of this target gene, consistent with a loss of function
and without a dominant-negative effect. However, this mutant mRNA showed
complete phenotypic rescue of morpholino knockout zebrafish embryos,
indicating that it is a hypomorphic allele. The patient had the typical
facial gestalt of the disorder, moderate intellectual disability,
delayed walking, and seizures, but no microcephaly and no cardiac or
gastrointestinal abnormalities.

.0017
MOWAT-WILSON SYNDROME
ZEB2, HIS1045ARG

In a boy with a relatively mild form of Mowat-Wilson syndrome (235730),
Ghoumid et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous de novo c.3134A-G
transition in the ZEB2 gene, resulting in a his1045-to-arg (H1045R)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the C-terminal zinc finger
domain. The mutation was not present in 200 control chromosomes or in
SNP databases. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutant protein lost the ability to bind to the E-cadherin (CDH1; 192090)
promoter and to repress transcription of this target gene, consistent
with a loss of function and without a dominant-negative effect. However,
this mutant mRNA showed 53% phenotypic rescue of morpholino knockout
zebrafish embryos, indicating that it is a hypomorphic allele. The
patient had a mild facial gestalt of the disorder, moderate intellectual
disability, delayed walking, hippocampal abnormalities, frontal cortical
atrophy, and hypospadias, but no microcephaly and no cardiac or
gastrointestinal abnormalities.

604977	TITLE *604977 SERINE/THREONINE PROTEIN KINASE 19; STK19
;;HLA-RP1
DESCRIPTION Phosphorylation events are key to most nuclear and cytoplasmic
processes. Cellular protein kinases and phosphatases are involved in the
regulation of differentiation, cell division, transcription, and DNA
repair. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation can either activate or
inactivate other proteins.

In addition to the class I, II, and III genes of the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) in 6p21.3, other genes may be involved
in the susceptibility to autoimmune and immunodeficiency diseases
associated with various MHC types. By screening cDNA libraries using a
DNA fragment upstream of the C4A gene (120810), which is localized to
the class III region of the MHC, followed by RT-PCR, Shen et al. (1994)
isolated a cDNA encoding STK19, which they named RP in honor of the
Nobel laureate immunochemist Sir Rodney R. Porter. The predicted
364-amino acid STK19 protein has an extremely hydrophilic N-terminal
half and a C-terminal half with alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic
regions. STK19 contains a positively charged putative nuclear
localization signal, multiple potential phosphorylation sites, 2
amidation sites, 9 potential N-myristoylation sites, and no
N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis of various cell lines
revealed ubiquitous expression of a 1.6- to 1.8-kb STK19 transcript.
Shen et al. (1994) determined that the STK19 gene contains 9 exons and
is located 611 bp upstream of the C4A gene. The 5-prime region of the
STK19 gene is rich in CpG sequences, which is typical of a housekeeping
gene, and there are 8 Alu elements in intron 4.

By screening BamHI-digested DNA on a zoo blot using a CpG island-rich
probe derived from an MHC cosmid clone, followed by screening a phorbol
ester-stimulated monocytic cell line using a genomic DNA fragment
upstream of the C4A gene, Sargent et al. (1994) isolated a cDNA encoding
a 258-amino acid STK19 protein. The authors referred to the STK19 gene
as G11 and the 258-amino acid protein as G11-Y. They also identified an
inphase STK19 splice variant of 254 amino acids. Homology searches found
limited sequence similarity with a number of proteins; the most
significant similarity was with the tyrosine kinase transforming protein
of fujinami sarcoma virus. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.4-kb
STK19 transcript in multiple cell lines, suggesting ubiquitous
expression. Genomic sequence analysis using the G11-Y cDNA indicated
that the STK19 gene contains 7 exons and spans 9.1 kb.

Gomez-Escobar et al. (1998) showed that the 368-amino acid STK19 protein
(Shen et al., 1994), which they termed G11-Z, and the 258-amino acid
STK19 protein (G11-Y; Sargent et al., 1994), which lacks the N-terminal
110 amino acids present in G11-Z, are both intracellular proteins.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses determined that the STK19
gene is expressed as 41.5-kD (G11-Z) and 30-kD (G11-Y) proteins.
Functional analysis demonstrated that STK19 has a manganese-dependent
protein kinase activity that phosphorylates alpha-casein (CSN1; 115450)
at ser/thr residues and histone (see 142711) at ser residues.
Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that STK19 is localized primarily
in the nucleus.

613447	TITLE *613447 SPINDLE- AND CENTRIOLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; SPICE1
;;SPINDLE AND CENTRIOLE PROTEIN; SPICE;;
COILED-COIL DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 52, FORMERLY; CCDC52, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mass spectrometry, Archinti et al. (2010) identified SPICE as a
centriole-associated protein. The deduced 856-amino acid protein
contains central and C-terminal coiled-coil domains. Immunohistochemical
analysis of HeLa and U2OS cells revealed that endogenous SPICE localized
to centrioles throughout the cell cycle and to spindle microtubules
during mitosis. Fluorescence-tagged SPICE showed the same localization
pattern in transfected cells. SPICE colocalized with centrin (see
603187) in foci at the proximal part of centrioles. Database analysis
revealed orthologs of SPICE only in vertebrates.

GENE FUNCTION

Using gene tagging on BACs, protein localization, and tandem-affinity
purification-mass spectrometry, Hutchins et al. (2010) found that CCDC52
interacted with CEP120 (613446), a protein required for centriole
duplication.

By mutation analysis, Archinti et al. (2010) found that distinct regions
of SPICE mediated its targeting to spindles and centrioles and that the
central conserved coiled-coil region was required for centriole
localization. Depletion of SPICE expression in HeLa and U2OS cells via
RNA interference impaired centriole duplication and caused severe
mitotic defects. SPICE depletion compromised spindle architecture,
spindle pole integrity, and chromosome congression, even in cells in
which centriole duplication had occurred. Archinti et al. (2010)
concluded that SPICE is an important dual-function regulator required
for centriole duplication and for proper bipolar spindle formation and
chromosome congression in mitosis.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the CCDC52 gene to chromosome 3q13.2 based on an
alignment of the CCDC52 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK057966) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

194549	TITLE *194549 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 76; ZNF76
;;D6S229E
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ragoussis et al. (1992) identified a novel testis-expressed zinc finger
gene, ZNF76, by screening cDNA libraries with cosmids derived from 6p21.
ZNF76 is a member of the GLI-Kruppel family of DNA binding proteins. It
is conserved in mouse where transcription in testis is initiated at day
20 after birth. The mouse tcp-11 gene is located in the distal inversion
of the t-complex and is developmentally regulated in the same manner as
ZNF76. They are expressed in testis at exactly the same time. Ragoussis
et al. (1992) isolated the human homolog of tcp-11 (186982) by use of a
combination of somatic cell hybrids, radiation hybrids, metaphase and
interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization, and pulsed field gel
electrophoresis.

Staf is a Xenopus transcriptional activator that enhances transcription
of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and snRNA-type genes by RNA polymerases II
(pol II) and III (pol III), and can also stimulate expression from a pol
II mRNA promoter. See ZNF143 (603433). Myslinski et al. (1998) found
that both ZNF76 and ZNF143 had homology to Staf. The predicted 515-amino
acid ZNF76 protein shares 64% and 63% identity with Staf and ZNF143,
respectively. Like Staf, both ZNF76 and ZNF143 contain 7 zinc fingers
and an activation domain with the mRNA and snRNA activation regions.
Both proteins bound Staf-responsive elements in vitro. When expressed in
Drosophila cells, both activated transcription from an mRNA promoter
through the Staf binding site. Chimeric ZNF76 and ZNF143 proteins
activated a pol II mRNA promoter, as well as pol II and pol III snRNA
promoters, in Xenopus oocytes. Northern blot analysis revealed that the
2.9-kb ZNF76 mRNA was expressed in all tissues tested, with the
strongest expression in testis. Myslinski et al. (1998) concluded that
ZNF76 is a novel DNA-binding protein related to Staf and ZNF143.

MAPPING

Ragoussis et al. (1992) mapped the human ZNF76 and TCP11 genes to the
chromosome 6p21.3-p21.2 region and linked them to each other within 300
kb of DNA, approximately 2 Mb centromeric to the major
histocompatibility complex. (The D number assigned to ZNF76 was
D6S229E.)

;;LANTHIONINE-SYNTHETASE COMPONENT C-LIKE 1 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR;;
G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 69A; GPR69A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By affinity chromatography of solubilized human erythrocyte membrane
proteins, Mayer et al. (1998) identified p40, a 40-kD protein that
interacts with the C-terminus of the membrane protein stomatin (133090).
They used the sequence of p40 peptides to identify partial cDNAs in an
EST database, and then cloned cDNAs corresponding to the entire coding
region using a PCR strategy. The predicted 399-amino acid protein
contains the characteristic features of G protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs), including 7 transmembrane domains. Northern blot analysis
revealed that p40 is expressed as a major 4.8-kb mRNA and as a minor
1.9-kb mRNA in all tissues. Dot blot experiments indicated that the
highest levels of expression were in brain, spinal cord, testis,
pituitary gland, and kidney. Using in situ hybridization to monkey
tissues, Mayer et al. (1998) determined that p40 is expressed at high
levels in neurons of the brain and spinal cord, in thymocytes,
megakaryocytes, and macrophages.

Bauer et al. (2000) determined that LANCL1 is not an integral membrane
protein, but rather a weakly associated peripheral membrane protein, and
is not a GPCR. They found that LANCL1 contains 7 highly conserved
hydrophobic repeats and may play a role in peptide modification. Western
blot analysis showed that LANCL1 is mainly expressed in brain, testis,
ovary, and kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2009) showed that LANCL1 exhibited Zn(2+)-dependent
glutathione binding. LANCL1 also bound the SH3 domain of mouse Eps8
(600206), but not other SH3-containing proteins. The interaction between
LANCL1 and Eps8 did not require either of the PxxP motifs of LANCL1, but
it was inhibited by glutathione. Overexpression of LANCL1 in rat PC12
cells had no effect on NGF (see 162030)-induced neurite outgrowth, but
overexpression of an LANCL1 mutant defective in Eps8 binding inhibited
NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by 50%.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Zhang et al. (2009) reported the crystal structure of LANCL1, which
consists of 2 concentric alpha-helical barrels made up of 7 helices
each. A GxxG-containing bulge that mediates Zn(2+) binding is located at
the N terminus of each of the 7 inner helices. LANCL1 had a similar
structure when cocrystalized with glutathione. In addition to
Zn(2+)-mediated binding, there were extensive interactions between
LANCL1 and glutathione.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mayer et al. (2001) determined that the human and mouse LANCL1 genes
span 45 kb and 38 kb, respectively, each comprising 10 exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the LANCL1
gene to 2q33-q35 (TMAP WI-13674). By FISH, Mayer et al. (2001) mapped
the LANCL1 gene to 2q34 and the mouse homolog to a region of conserved
synteny at chromosome 1C2-C5.

;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 95; ZFP95;;
KIAA1015
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a brain cDNA library, Nagase et al.
(1999) cloned ZKSCAN5, which they designated KIAA1015. The transcript
contains a repetitive element in its 3-prime UTR, and the deduced
protein contains 839 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected low to moderate
expression in all tissues and specific brain regions examined.

By screening a fetal cartilage cDNA library with a degenerate probe
corresponding to the Kruppel zinc finger motif, followed by screening
amniocyte and testis cDNA libraries, Dreyer et al. (1999) obtained a
full-length cDNA encoding ZKSCAN5, which they called ZFP95. The deduced
839-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal SCAN box, followed by a
KRAB A domain and a C-terminal zinc finger domain. Dreyer et al. (1999)
also identified 2 alternatively spliced transcripts, one encoding a
protein lacking the KRAB A domain, and the other encoding a protein
lacking the KRAB A domain and an additional 26 amino acids. Northern
blot analysis detected 4.2- and 4.6-kb transcripts in all tissues
examined, with highest expression in testis. A 3.8-kb transcript was
also detected in adult testis.

Weissig et al. (2003) cloned 3 cDNAS for mouse Zfp95. The longest
deduced protein contains 819 amino acids and has 12 zinc finger domains
in its C-terminal half. Northern blot analysis detected highest Zfp95
expression in testis, with lower levels in brain, heart, kidney, liver,
tongue, lung, and striated muscle. A second transcript was expressed
exclusively in testis. Expression of the testis-specific Zfp95
transcript in isolated germ cells was highest in pachytene
spermatocytes, followed by round spermatids. Mice with the recessive
atrichosis (at) mutation are almost hairless and sterile, with small
gonads that contain few germ cells. Weissig et al. (2003) found
homozygous at mutant mice lacked expression of the testis-specific Zfp95
transcript, whereas the more widely expressed Zfp95 transcript was
expressed in testis, epididymis, seminal vesicle, and prostate. They
concluded that Zfp95 shows differential splicing in meiotic and
postmeiotic germ cells only.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dreyer et al. (1999) determined that the ZKSCAN5 gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the ZKSCAN5
gene to chromosome 7. Using radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Dreyer
et al. (1999) mapped the ZKSCAN5 gene to chromosome 7q22.

Weissig et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Zkscan5 gene to chromosome 5.

139250	TITLE *139250 GROWTH HORMONE 1; GH1
;;GH;;
GROWTH HORMONE, NORMAL; GHN;;
GROWTH HORMONE, PITUITARY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Growth hormone (GH) is synthesized by acidophilic or somatotropic cells
of the anterior pituitary gland. Human growth hormone has a molecular
mass of 22,005 and contains 191 amino acid residues with 2 disulfide
bridges (Niall et al., 1971).

CLONING

By 1977, not only had the amino acid sequence of GH been determined, but
the sequence of nucleotides in the structural gene for GH had been
determined as well (Baxter et al., 1977).

By molecular cloning of cDNA, Masuda et al. (1988) demonstrated that the
20-kD variant of human GH is produced by the same gene (GHN or GH1) as
the 22-kD form, and that a process of alternative splicing is involved.

Chen et al. (1989) sequenced the entire 66,500 bp of the GH gene
cluster. The expression of the 5 genes in this cluster was examined by
screening pituitary and placenta cDNA libraries, using gene-specific
oligonucleotides. According to this analysis, the GHN gene is
transcribed exclusively in the pituitary, whereas the other 4 genes
(CSL, 603515; CSA, 150200; GHV, 139240; and CSB, 118820) are expressed
only in placental tissues. The CSL gene carries a G-to-A transition in a
sequence used by the other 4 genes as an intronic 5-prime splice donor
site. The mutation results in a different splicing pattern and, hence,
in a novel sequence of the CSL gene mRNA and the deduced polypeptide.

GH and CSH (CSA) have 191 amino acid residues and show about 85%
homology in amino acid sequence (Owerbach et al., 1980). Their messenger
RNAs have more than 90% homology.

GENE FUNCTION

Human GH binds 2 GHR (600946) molecules and induces signal transduction
through receptor dimerization. Sundstrom et al. (1996) noted that at
high concentrations, GH acts as an antagonist because of a large
difference in affinities at the respective binding sites. This
antagonist action can be enhanced further by reducing binding in the
low-affinity binding site. A possible mechanism by which mutant,
biologically inactive GH may have its effect is to act as an antagonist
to the binding of normal GH to its receptor, GHR.

The regulation of GH synthesis and release is modulated by a family of
genes that include the transcription factors PROP1 (601538) and PIT1
(173110). PROP1 and PIT1 regulate differentiation of pituitary cells
into somatotrophs, which synthesize and release GH. Genes that are
important in the release of GH include the GHRH (139190) and GHRHR
(139191) genes. After GHRH is synthesized and released from the
hypothalamus, it travels to the anterior pituitary where it binds to
GHRHR, resulting in transduction of a signal into the somatotroph which
promotes release of presynthesized GH that is stored in secretory
granules. Other gene products that are important in GH synthesis and
release are GHR and the growth hormone-binding proteins (GHBP). The
GHBPs are derived from the membrane bound receptor (GHR) and they remain
bound to GH in the circulation. Following binding of GH to 2 GHR
molecules, the signal to produce IGF1 (147440) is transduced. The GH
molecules that are bound to membrane-anchored GH receptors can be
released into the circulation by excision of the extracellular portion
of the GHR molecules. At this point, the extracellular portion of the
GHR, which is referred to as the GHBP, serves to stabilize GH in the
circulation. The final genes in the GH synthetic pathway include IGF1
and its receptor (IGF1R; 147370), whose products stimulate growth in
various tissues including bones and muscle (Phillips, 1995; Rimoin and
Phillips, 1997).

Boguszewski et al. (1997) investigated the proportion of circulating
non-22-kD GH1 isoforms in prepubertal children with short stature
(height less than -2 SD score) of different etiologies. The study groups
consisted of 17 girls with Turner syndrome (TS), aged 3 to 13 years; 25
children born small for gestational age (SGA) without postnatal catch-up
growth, aged 3 to 13 years; and 24 children with idiopathic short
stature (ISS), aged 4 to 15 years. The results were compared with those
from 23 prepubertal healthy children of normal stature (height +/- 2 SD
score), aged 4 to 13 years. Serum non-22-kD GH levels, expressed as a
percentage of the total GH concentration, were determined by the 22-kD
GH exclusion assay. The median proportion of non-22-kD GH isoforms was
8.1% in normal children; it was increased in children born SGA (9.8%; P
= 0.05) and in girls with TS (9.9%; P = 0.01), but not in children with
ISS (8.9%). In children born SGA, the proportion of non-22-kD GH
isoforms directly correlated with different estimates of spontaneous GH
secretion and inversely correlated with height SD score. The authors
concluded that the ratio of non-22-kD GH isoforms in the circulation may
have important implications for normal and abnormal growth.

Mendlewicz et al. (1999) studied the contributions of genetic and
environmental factors in the regulation of the 24-hour GH secretion. The
24-hour profile of plasma GH was obtained at 15-minute intervals in 10
pairs of monozygotic and 9 pairs of dizygotic normal male twins, aged 16
to 34 years. A major genetic effect was evidenced on GH secretion during
wakefulness (heritability estimate of 0.74) and, to a lesser extent, on
the 24-hour GH secretion. Significant genetic influences were also
identified for slow-wave sleep and height. These results suggested that
human GH secretion in young adulthood is markedly dependent on genetic
factors.

Hindmarsh et al. (1999) studied GH secretory patterns in the elderly by
constructing 24-hour serum GH profiles in 45 male and 38 female
volunteers, aged 59.4 to 73.0 years, and related patterns to IGF1,
IGFBP3 (146732), and GH-binding protein levels; body mass index; and
waist/hip ratio. There was a highly significant difference in mean
24-hour serum GH concentrations in females compared to males as a result
of significantly higher trough GH levels in females. Peak values were
not significantly different. Serum IGF1 levels were significantly higher
in males. Peak GH values were related to serum IGF1 levels, whereas
trough GH levels were not. GH was secreted with a dominant periodicity
of 200 minutes in males and 280 minutes in females. GH secretion
assessed by ApEn was more disordered in females, and increasing disorder
was associated with lower IGF1 levels. Body mass index was negatively
related to GH in both sexes. In males, trough values were the major
determinant, whereas in females, the peak value was the major
determinant. Trough GH levels were inversely related in both sexes to
waist/hip ratio and to increasing secretory disorder. These data
demonstrated a sexually dimorphic pattern of GH secretion in the
elderly.

De Groof et al. (2002) evaluated the GH/IGF1 axis and the levels of
IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), IGFBP3 protease, glucose, insulin
(176730), and cytokines in 27 children with severe septic shock due to
meningococcal sepsis during the first 3 days after admission. The median
age was 22 months. Significant differences were found between
nonsurvivors and survivors for the levels of total IGF1, free IGF1,
IGFBP1 (146730), IGFBP3 protease activity, IL6 (147620), and TNFA
(191160). The pediatric risk of mortality score correlated significantly
with levels of IGFBP1, IGFBP3 protease activity, IL6, and TNFA and with
levels of total IGFI and free IGFI. Levels of GH and IGFBP1 were
extremely elevated in nonsurvivors, whereas total and free IGFI levels
were markedly decreased and were accompanied by high levels of the
cytokines IL6 and TNFA.

In rodents and humans there is a sexually dimorphic pattern of GH
secretion that influences the serum concentration of IGF1. Geary et al.
(2003) studied the plasma concentrations of IGF1, IGF2 (147470), IGFBP3,
and GH in cord blood taken from the offspring of 987 singleton Caucasian
pregnancies born at term and related these values to birth weight,
length, and head circumference. Cord plasma concentrations of IGF1,
IGF2, and IGFBP3 were influenced by factors related to birth size:
gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, maternal height, and
parity of the mother. Plasma GH concentrations were inversely related to
the plasma concentrations of IGF1 and IGFBP3; 10.2% of the variability
in cord plasma IGF1 concentration and 2.7% for IGFBP3 was explained by
sex of the offspring and parity. Birth weight, length, and head
circumference measurements were greater in males than females (P less
than 0.001). Mean cord plasma concentrations of IGF1 and IGFBP3 were
significantly lower in males than females. Cord plasma GH concentrations
were higher in males than females, but no difference was noted between
the sexes for IGF2. After adjustment for gestational age, parity, and
maternal height, cord plasma concentrations of IGF1 and IGFBP3 along
with sex explained 38.0% of the variability in birth weight, 25.0% in
birth length, and 22.7% in head circumference.

Ho et al. (2002) noted that the human GH gene cluster encompasses GHN,
which is expressed primarily in pituitary somatotropes, and 4 genes,
CSA, CSB, CSL, and GHV, which are expressed specifically in
syncytiotrophoblast cells lining the placental villi. A multicomponent
locus control region (LCR) is required for transcriptional activation in
both pituitary and placenta. In addition, 2 genes overlap with the GH
LCR: SCN4A (603967) on the 5-prime end and CD79B (147245) on the 3-prime
end. Ho et al. (2002) studied mice carrying an 87-kb human transgene
encompassing the GH LCR and most of the GH gene cluster. By deleting a
fragment of the transgene, they showed that a single determinant of the
human GH LCR located 14.5 kb 5-prime to the GHN promoter has a critical,
specific, and nonredundant role in facilitating promoter trans factor
binding and activating GHN transcription. Ho et al. (2002) found that
this same determinant plays an essential role in establishing a 32-kb
acetylated domain that encompasses the entire GH LCR and the contiguous
GHN promoter. These data supported a model for long-range gene
activation via LCR-mediated targeting and extensive spreading of core
histone acetylation.

Using mice carrying the 87-kb human GH transgene, Ho et al. (2006) found
that insertion of a Pol II terminator within the GH LCR blocked
transcription of the CD79B gene adjacent to the LCR and repressed GHN
expression. However, the insertion had little effect on acetylation
within the GH locus. Selective elimination of CD79B also repressed GHN
expression. Ho et al. (2006) concluded that Pol II tracking and histone
acetylation are not linked and that transcription, but not translation,
of the CD79B gene is required for GHN expression.

In addition to expression in pituitary and placenta and functions in
growth and reproduction, prolactin (PRL; 176760), GH, and placental
lactogen (CSH1; 150200) are expressed in endothelial cells and have
angiogenic effects. Ge et al. (2007) found that BMP1 (112264) and
BMP1-like proteinases processed PRL and GH in vitro and in vivo to
produce approximately 17-kD N-terminal fragments with antiangiogenic
activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

The GH, PL (CSH1), and PRL genes contain 5 exons separated by 4 introns.
The introns occur at the same sites, supporting evolutionary homology
(Baxter, 1981). All 5 genes in the GH gene cluster are in the same
transcriptional orientation (Ho et al., 2002).

Baxter (1981) found evidence for the existence of at least 3 GH and 3
CSH, also called placental lactogen (PL), genes on chromosome 17.
Whether they are situated GH:GH:GH:PL:PL:PL or arranged
GH:PL:GH:PL:GH:PL was not clear.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Sundstrom et al. (1996) crystallized a GH antagonist mutant, gly120 to
arg, with its receptor as a 1-to-1 complex and determined the crystal
structure at 2.9-angstrom resolution. The 1-to-1 complex with the
agonist is remarkably similar to the native GHR 1-to-2 complex. A
comparison between the 2 structures revealed only minimal differences in
the conformations of the hormone or its receptor in the 2 complexes.

EVOLUTION

Owerbach et al. (1980) estimated that the GH and CSH genes diverged
about 50 to 60 million years ago, whereas the PRL and GH genes diverged
about 400 million years ago.

Human PL and human GH are more alike than are rat GH and human GH. (PL
has more growth-promoting effects than milk-producing effects.) Baxter
(1981) proposed that in evolution the prolactin gene diverged early from
the gene that was the common progenitor of the GH and PL genes.
(Placental lactogen was the official Endocrine Society designation;
Grumbach (1981) promoted the term chorionic somatomammotropin, which has
functional legitimacy.)

MAPPING

By a combination of restriction mapping and somatic cell hybridization,
Owerbach et al. (1980) assigned genes for growth hormone, chorionic
somatomammotropin (CSH), and a third growth hormone-like gene (GH2;
139240) to the growth hormone gene cluster that is assigned to
chromosome 17.

Lebo (1980) corroborated the assignment of the GH gene to chromosome 17
by the technique of fluorescence-activated chromosome sorting. George et
al. (1981) assigned the genes for GH and CSH to the 17q21-qter region.

Ruddle (1982) found that the GH family of genes is between galactokinase
(604313) and thymidine kinase (TK1; 188300), with galactokinase being
closer to the centromere.

Harper et al. (1982) used in situ hybridization to assign the GH gene
cluster to 17q22-q24. A gene copy number experiment showed that both
genes are present in about 3 copies per haploid genome. The sequence of
genes in the GH gene cluster is thought to be GHN--CSL--CSA--GHV--CSB
(Phillips, 1983). Normal growth hormone (GHN, referred to now as GH1)
encodes GH. CSA and CSB both encode chorionic somatomammotropin. GHV, or
growth hormone variant, is now designated GH2.

Xu et al. (1988) assigned the growth hormone complex to 17q23-q24 by in
situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using GH cDNA as a specific DNA probe in Southern blot analyses,
Phillips et al. (1981) found that the GHN (GH1) gene was deleted in 2
families with type IA growth hormone deficiency (Illig type; 262400). On
the other hand, the GH genes of persons with type IB (612781) (in 6
families) had normal restriction patterns. Two affected sibs in 2 of the
6 families were discordant for 2 restriction markers closely linked to
the GH cluster.

Braga et al. (1986) reported the cases of a son and daughter of
first-cousin Italian parents who had isolated growth hormone deficiency
(IGHD) resulting from homozygosity for a 7.6-kb deletion within the GH
gene cluster. Both developed antibodies in response to treatment with
human GH, but in neither was there interference with growth. The
deletion affected not only the structural gene for GH (GH1) but also
sequences adjacent to CSL.

Goossens et al. (1986) described a double deletion in the GH gene
cluster in cases of inherited growth hormone deficiency. A total of
about 40 kb of DNA was absent due to 2 separate deletions flanking the
CSL gene (603515). Two affected sibs were homozygous. The parents were
'Romany of French origin' (i.e., French gypsies) and related as first
cousins once removed. Restriction patterns in them were consistent with
heterozygosity.

Vnencak-Jones et al. (1988) described the molecular basis of deletions
within the human GH gene cluster in 9 unrelated patients. Their results
suggested that the presence of highly repetitive DNA sequences flanking
the GH1 gene predisposed to unequal recombinant events through
chromosomal misalignment.

In a Chinese family, He et al. (1990) found that 2 sibs with GH
deficiency had a deletion of approximately 7.1 kb of DNA. The parents,
who were related as second cousins, were heterozygous but of normal
stature. The affected children had not received exogenous GH, but the
authors suspected that their disorder represented IGHD type IA.

Akinci et al. (1992) described a Turkish family in which 3 children had
IGHD type IA. A homozygous deletion of approximately 45 kb encompassing
the GH1, CSL, CSA, and GH2 genes was found. The end points of the
deletion lay within 2 regions of highly homologous DNA sequence situated
5-prime to the GH1 gene and 5-prime to the CSB gene. The parents, who
were consanguineous, were both heterozygous for the deletion.

Mullis et al. (1992) analyzed GH1 DNA from circulating lymphocytes of 78
subjects with severe IGHD. The subjects analyzed were broadly grouped
into 3 different populations: 32 north European, 22 Mediterranean, and
24 Turkish. Of the 78 patients, 10 showed a GH1 deletion; 8 had a 6.7-kb
deletion, and the remaining 2 had a 7.6-kb GH1 deletion. Five of the 10
subjects developed anti-hGH antibodies to hGH replacement followed by a
stunted growth response. Parental consanguinity was found in all
families, and heterozygosity for the corresponding deletion was present
in each parent. The proportion of deletion cases was about the same in
each of the 3 population groups.

Phillips and Cogan (1994) tabulated mutations found in the GH gene.

Takahashi et al. (1996) reported the case of a boy with short stature
and heterozygosity for a mutant GH gene (139250.0008). In this child,
the GH not only could not activate the GH receptor (GHR; 600946) but
also inhibited the action of wildtype GH because of its greater affinity
for GHR and GH-binding protein (GHBP), which is derived from the
extracellular domain of the GHR. Thus, a dominant-negative effect was
observed. See Kowarski syndrome, 262650.

Splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts is regulated by consensus sequences at
intron boundaries and the branch site. In vitro studies showed that the
small introns of some genes also require intron splice enhancers (ISE)
to modulate splice site selection. An autosomal dominant form of
isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD II; 173100) can be caused by
mutations in intron 3 (IVS3) of the GH1 gene that cause exon 3 skipping,
resulting in truncated GH1 gene products that prevent secretion of
normal GH. Some of these GH1 mutations are located 28 to 45 nucleotides
into IVS3 (which is 92 nucleotides long). McCarthy and Phillips (1998)
localized this ISE by quantitating the effects of deletions within IVS3
on skipping of exon 3. The importance of individual nucleotides to ISE
function was determined by analyzing the effects of point mutants and
additional deletions. The results showed that (1) an ISE with a
G(2)X(1-4)G(3) motif resides in IVS3 of the GH1 gene; (2) both runs of
Gs are required for ISE function; (3) a single copy of the ISE regulates
exon 3 skipping; and (4) ISE function can be modified by an adjacent AC
element. The findings revealed a new mechanism by which mutations can
cause inherited human endocrine disorders and suggested that (1) ISEs
may regulate splicing of transcripts of other genes, and (2) mutations
of these ISEs or of the transacting factors that bind them may cause
other genetic disorders.

Hasegawa et al. (2000) studied polymorphisms in the GH1 gene that were
associated with altered GH production. The subjects included 43
prepubertal short children with GHD without gross pituitary
abnormalities, 46 short children with normal GH secretion, and 294
normal adults. A polymorphism in intron 4 (A or T at nucleotide 1663,
designated P1) was identified. Two additional polymorphic sites (T or G
at nucleotide 218, designated P2, and G or T at nucleotide 439,
designated P3) in the promoter region of the GH1 gene were also
identified and matched with the P1 polymorphism (A or T, respectively)
in more than 90% of the subjects. P1, P2, and P3 were considered to be
associated with GH production. For example, the allele frequency of T at
P2 in prepubertal short children with GHD without gross pituitary
abnormalities (58%) was significantly different from that in short
children with normal GH secretion and normal adults (37% and 44%,
respectively). Furthermore, significant differences were observed in
maximal GH peaks in provocative tests, IGF1 (147440) SD scores, and
height SD scores in children with the T/T or G/G genotypes at P2. In the
entire study group, significant differences in IGF1 SD scores and height
SD scores were observed between the T/T and G/G genotypes at P2.
Hasegawa et al. (2000) concluded that GH secretion is partially
determined by polymorphisms in the GH1 gene, explaining some of the
variations in GH secretion and height.

Dennison et al. (2004) examined associations between common SNPs in the
GH1 gene and weight in infancy, adult bone mass and bone loss rates, and
circulating GH profiles. Genomic DNA was examined for 2 SNPs in the GH
gene, 1 in the promoter region and 1 in intron 4. Homozygotes at loci
GH1 A5157G and T6331A displayed low baseline bone density and
accelerated bone loss; there was also a significant (P = 0.04)
interaction among weight at 1 year, GH1 genotype, and bone loss rate.
There was a graded association between alleles and circulating GH
concentration among men. The authors concluded that common diversity in
the GH1 region predisposes to osteoporosis via effects on the level of
GH expression.

The proximal promoter region of the GH1 gene is highly polymorphic,
containing at least 15 SNPs. This variation is manifest in 40 different
haplotypes, the high diversity being explicable in terms of gene
conversion, recurrent mutation, and selection. Horan et al. (2003)
showed by functional analysis that 12 haplotypes were associated with a
significantly reduced level of reporter gene expression, whereas 10
haplotypes were associated with a significantly increased level. The
former tended to be more prevalent in the general population than the
latter (p less than 0.01), possibly as a consequence of selection.
Haplotype partitioning identified 6 SNPs as major determinants of GH1
gene expression, which is influenced by an LCR located between 14.5 and
32 kb upstream of the GH1 gene (Jones et al., 1995). Horan et al. (2003)
used a series of LCR-GH1 proximal promoter constructs to demonstrate
that the LCR enhanced proximal promoter activity by up to 2.8-fold
depending upon proximal promoter haplotype, and that the activity of a
given proximal promoter haplotype was also differentially enhanced by
different LCR haplotypes. The genetic basis of interindividual
differences in GH1 gene expression thus appeared to be extremely
complex.

Millar et al. (2003) sought to identify subtle mutations in the GH1
gene, which had been regarded as a comparatively rare cause of short
stature, in 3 groups: 41 individuals selected for short stature, reduced
height velocity, and bone age delay, 11 individuals with short stature
and IGHD, and 154 controls. Heterozygous mutations were identified in
all 3 groups but disproportionately in the individuals with short
stature, both with and without IGHD. Twenty-four novel GH1 gene lesions
were found. Fifteen novel GH1 gene mutations were considered to be of
probable phenotypic significance. Although most such lesions may be
insufficient on their own to account for the observed clinical
phenotype, they were considered likely to play a contributory role in
the etiology of short stature.

In a screen of the GH1 gene for mutations in a group of 74 children with
familial short stature, Lewis et al. (2004) identified 4 mutations, 2 of
which were novel: an ile179-to-met (I179M) substitution and a
single-basepair substitution in the promoter region. Resistance to
proteolysis and secretion from rat pituitary cells of I179M GH were
consistent with a lack of significant misfolding. Receptor binding
studies were normal, but molecular modeling studies suggested that the
I179M substitution might perturb interactions between GH and the GH
receptor loop containing residue trp169, thereby affecting signal
transduction. In contrast to its ability to activate STAT5 (601511)
normally, activation of ERK (see 176948) by the I179M variant was
reduced to half that observed with wildtype. The subject exhibited
normal GH secretion after pharmacologic stimulation. That the I179M
variant did not cosegregate with the short stature phenotype in the
family strongly suggested to Lewis et al. (2004) that this variant was
on its own insufficient to fully account for the observed clinical
phenotype.

Cogan et al. (1995, 1997) and Moseley et al. (2002) described 3
mutations (139250.0016; 139250.0011; 139250.0012) that are not located
at the 5-prime splice site in intron 3 but still alter splicing of GH1
to cause increased production of a 17.5-kD isoform. All 3 mutations
reside within purine-rich sequences that resemble exonic and intronic
splicing enhancers (ESE and ISE). Since splicing enhancers often
activate specific splice sites to facilitate exon definition, Ryther et
al. (2003) considered that the splicing defects caused by these
mutations could be due to a defect in exon definition, resulting in exon
skipping. They showed that overexpression of the dominant-negative
17.5-kD isoform also destroyed the majority of somatotrophs, leading to
anterior pituitary hypoplasia in transgenic mice. They demonstrated that
dual splicing enhancers are required to ensure exon 3 definition to
produce full-length 22-kD hormone. They also showed that splicing
enhancer mutations that weaken exon 3 recognition produce variable
amounts of the 17.5-kD isoform, a result that could potentially explain
the clinical variability observed in IGHD II. Noncanonical splicing
mutations that disrupt splicing enhancers, such as those represented by
the 3 mutations discussed, demonstrate the importance of enhancer
elements in regulating alternative splicing to prevent human disease.

Mullis et al. (2005) studied a total of 57 subjects with IGHD type II
(173100) belonging to 19 families with different splice site as well as
missense mutations within the GH1 gene. The subjects presenting with a
splice site mutation within the first 2 bp of intervening sequence 3
(5-prime IVS +1/+2 bp; 139250.0009) leading to a skipping of exon 3 were
more likely to present in the follow-up with other pituitary hormone
deficiencies. In addition, although the patients with missense mutations
had been reported to be less affected, a number of patients presenting
with a missense GH form showed some pituitary hormone impairment. The
development of multiple hormonal deficiencies is not age-dependent, and
there is a clear variability in onset, severity, and progression, even
within the same families. Mullis et al. (2005) concluded that the
message of clinical importance from these studies is that the pituitary
endocrine status of all such patients should continue to be monitored
closely over the years because further hormonal deficiencies may evolve
with time.

Shariat et al. (2008) studied a 4-generation family segregating
autosomal dominant growth hormone deficiency and identified a
heterozygous missense mutation in the GH gene (EX3+1G-A; 139250.0025) in
affected individuals. Analysis of the effects of this variant as well as
G-T and G-C changes at the first nucleotide of exon 3 illustrated the
multiple mechanisms by which changes in sequence can cause disease:
splice site mutations, splicing enhancer function, messenger RNA decay,
missense mutations, and nonsense mutations. The authors noted that for
IGHD II, only exon skipping leads to production of the dominant-negative
isoform, with increasing skipping correlating with increasing disease
severity.

Horan et al. (2006) observed an association between 4 core promoter
haplotypes in the GH1 gene and increased risk for hypertension and
stroke in a study of 111 hypertensive patients and 155 stroke patients.
The association was more significant for females than males. Horan et
al. (2006) also observed an association between an isoform of the GHR
gene lacking exon 3 (GHRd3) and hypertension in female stroke patients.
The authors postulated a complex interaction between variants in the GH1
and GHR genes involving height.

Giordano et al. (2008) studied the contribution to IGHD of genetic
variations in the GH1 gene regulatory regions. The T allele of a G-to-T
polymorphism at position -57 (dbSNP rs2005172), within the vitamin
D-responsive element, showed a positive significant association when
comparing patients with normal (P = 0.006) or short stature (P = 0.0011)
controls. The genotype -57TT showed an odds ratio of 2.93 (1.44-5.99)
and 2.99 (1.42-6.31), respectively. Giordano et al. (2008) concluded
that the common -57G-T polymorphism contributes to IGHD susceptibility,
indicating that it may have a multifactorial etiology.

ANIMAL MODEL

By Southern analysis of DNA from mouse-rat somatic cell hybrids, Cooke
et al. (1986) found that the GH gene is on rat chromosome 10 and the PRL
gene (176760) is on rat chromosome 17. Thus, in the rat, as in man,
these genes are on different chromosomes even though they show an
evolutionary relationship.

Morgan et al. (1987) showed that retrovirus-mediated gene transfer can
be used to introduce a recombinant human GH1 gene into cultured human
keratinocytes. The transduced keratinocytes secreted biologically active
GH into the culture medium. When grafted as an epithelial sheet onto
athymic mice, these cultured keratinocytes reconstituted a
normal-appearing epidermis from which, however, human growth hormone
could be extracted. Transduced epidermal cells may be a general vehicle
for the delivery of gene products by means of grafting.

Smith et al. (1997) demonstrated a role of GH in retinal
neovascularization, which is the major cause of untreatable blindness.
They found that retinal neovascularization was inhibited in transgenic
mice expressing a GH antagonist gene and in normal mice given an
inhibitor of GH secretion. In these mice retinal neovascularization was
inhibited in inverse proportion to serum levels of GH and IGF1.
Inhibition was reversed with exogenous IGF1 administration. GH
inhibition did not diminish hypoxia-stimulated retinal vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 192240) or VEGF receptor (VEGFR;
191306) expression. Smith et al. (1997) suggested that systemic
inhibition of GH or IGF1, or both, may have therapeutic potential in
preventing some forms of retinopathy.

Growth hormones from primates are unique in that they are able to bind
with and activate both primate and nonprimate GHRs, whereas GHs from
nonprimates are ineffective in primates. Behncken et al. (1997)
investigated the basis of primate specificity of binding by the GHR.
They examined the interaction between GHR residues arg43 (primate) or
leu43 (nonprimate) and their complementary hormone residues asp171
(primate) and his170 (nonprimate). They found that the interaction
between arg43 and his170/171 is sufficient to explain virtually all of
the primate species specificity.

In mouse preadipocytes, Wolfrum et al. (2003) found that Foxa2 (600288)
inhibited adipocyte differentiation by activating transcription of
preadipocyte factor-1 (DLK1; 176290), and that expression of both Foxa2
and Dlk1 was enhanced by growth hormone in primary preadipocytes.
Wolfrum et al. (2003) suggested that the antiadipogenic activity of
growth hormone is mediated by Foxa2.

Using GH-deficient Socs2 (605117) -/- mice, Greenhalgh et al. (2005)
demonstrated that the Socs2 -/- phenotype is dependent upon the presence
of endogenous GH. Treatment with exogenous GH induced excessive growth
in terms of overall body weight, body and bone lengths, and the weight
of internal organs and tissues. Microarray analysis on liver RNA
extracts after exogenous GH administration revealed a heightened
response to GH. The conserved C-terminal SOCS-box motif was essential
for all inhibitory function. SOCS2 was found to bind 2 phosphorylated
tyrosines on the GH receptor, and mutation analysis of these amino acids
showed that both were essential for SOCS2 function. Greenhalgh et al.
(2005) concluded that SOCS2 is a negative regulator of GH signaling.

ISOLATED GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY, TYPE IA
GH1, 2-BP DEL, FS132TER

Igarashi et al. (1993) identified a Japanese patient with growth
retardation (IGHD IA; 262400) with a compound heterozygous pattern
consisting of total deletion of 1 GH1 gene and retention of a GH1 gene
of apparently normal size. DNA sequence analysis demonstrated deletion
of 2 bases of exon 3 of 1 GH1 allele of the mother and the patient. The
father carried a 6.7-kb deletion (139250.0003), present also on the
patient's paternal allele. The patient was a 13-year-old female, the
offspring of healthy, nonconsanguineous parents. GH therapy, begun at
the age of 9 years and 2 months, resulted in catch-up growth without
development of anti-GH antibodies. Deletion of the 2 bases in exon 3 was
predicted to introduce a termination codon after the codon of amino acid
residue 131 in exon 4.

In a Turkish family with IGHD IA (262400), Cogan et al. (1993) found a
G-to-A transition converting codon 20 from tryptophan (TGG) to stop
(TAG) in the signal peptide of GH1. The mutation resulted in termination
of translation after residue 19 of the signal peptide and no production
of mature GH. Patients homozygous for the mutation had no detectable GH
and produced anti-GH antibodies in response to exogenous GH treatment.

ISOLATED GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY, TYPE IA
GH1, 6.7-KB DEL

Duquesnoy et al. (1990) described the cases of 2 sibs with IGHD IA
(262400) who were found to be compound heterozygotes for deletion and
frameshift mutations of the GH1 gene. Southern blot analysis showed them
to be heterozygous for a 6.7-kb GH deletion; DNA sequence analysis
demonstrated deletion of a cytosine at position 371, resulting in a
frameshift within the signal peptide coding region which prevented the
synthesis of any mature GH protein (139250.0004). The patients presented
with severe growth failure, and after an initial growth response to
treatment with exogenous GH, developed high titers of anti-GH
antibodies.

Vnencak-Jones et al. (1990) and Igarashi et al. (1993) also described
patients with 6.7-kb deletions deleting 1 GH1 allele.

GH1, IVS4, G-C, +1

In a consanguineous Saudi Arabian family with IGHD IB (612781), Cogan et
al. (1993) detected a G-to-C transversion of the first base of the donor
splice site of intron 4 as the basis of growth hormone deficiency. The
effect of this mutation on mRNA splicing was determined by transfecting
the mutant gene into cultured mammalian cells and DNA sequencing the
resulting GH cDNAs. Mutation was found to cause the activation of a
cryptic splice site 73 bases upstream of the exon 4 donor splice site.
The altered splicing resulted in loss of amino acids 103 to 126 of exon
4 and created a frameshift that altered the amino acids encoded by exon
5.

ISOLATED GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY, TYPE IB

In another consanguineous Saudi family with IGHD IB (612781), Phillips
and Cogan (1994) found a mutation at the same nucleotide as that
described in 139250.0005. A G-to-T transversion in the first base of the
donor splice site of intron 4 had the same effect on splicing as the
G-to-C transversion. Patients homozygous for these 2 different defects
in 2 different families responded well to exogenous GH treatment and did
not develop anti-GH antibodies. Analogous splicing mutations occurred in
the beta-globin gene, causing milder forms of beta-thalassemia called
beta-plus-thalassemia.

.0007
ISOLATED GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY, TYPE II
GH1, IVS3, T-C, +6

Phillips and Cogan (1994) demonstrated a T-to-C transition in the sixth
base of the donor splice site of intron 3 in a Turkish family with IGHD
II (173100). The mutant GH gene was transfected into cultured mammalian
cells, and the GH mRNA transcripts were analyzed by direct sequencing of
their corresponding cDNAs. The mutation was found to inactivate the
donor splice site of intron 3, resulting in alternative use of the donor
splice site of intron 2 in conjunction with the acceptor site of intron
3. This alternative splicing pattern deleted or skipped exon 3,
resulting in the loss of amino acids 32 to 71 from the corresponding
mature GH protein products. All affected members of the family were
heterozygous for the mutation and had low but measurable GH levels after
stimulation. All responded well to treatment with exogenous GH. The
mechanism of the dominant-negative effect is unknown; the mutant GH
allele may inactivate the normal GH allele by formation of GH dimers or
disruption of normal intracellular protein transport.

KOWARSKI SYNDROME
GH1, ARG77CYS

Takahashi et al. (1996) reported a patient with short stature in whom
the bioactivity of growth hormone was below the normal range (Kowarski
syndrome; 262650). The patient was heterozygous for a C-to-T transition
in the GH1 gene that converted codon 77 from CGC (arg) to TGC (cys)
(R77C). Isoelectric focusing of the proband's serum revealed the
presence of an abnormal growth hormone peak in addition to the normal
peak. Further studies demonstrated that the child's growth hormone not
only could not activate the growth hormone receptor but also inhibited
the action of wildtype growth hormone because of its greater affinity
for growth hormone-binding protein and growth hormone receptor.

Petkovic et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for the R77C mutation
in a Syrian boy with short stature and partial GH insensitivity. His
mother and grandfather had the same mutation and showed partial GH
insensitivity with modest short stature. Functional analyses showed no
differences in the binding affinity or bioactivity between wildtype and
GH-R77C, nor were differences found in the extent of subcellular
localization within endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, or secretory vesicles
between wildtype and GH-R77C. There was, however, a reduced capability
of GH-R477C to induce GHR/GHBP gene transcription rate when compared to
wildtype GH. Petkovic et al. (2007) concluded that reduced GHR/GHBP
expression might be a cause of the partial GH insensitivity with delay
in growth in this family.

GH1, IVS3, G-A, +1

Cogan et al. (1995) reported a G-to-A transition of the first base of
the donor splice site of intron 3 (+1G to A) in IGHD II (173100)
subjects from 3 unrelated kindreds from Sweden, North America, and South
Africa. This transition created an NlaIII site that was used to
demonstrate that all affected individuals in all 3 families were
heterozygous for the mutation. In expression studies the transition was
found to destroy the GH intron 3 donor splice site, causing skipping of
exon 3 and loss of amino acids 32 to 71 of the mature GH peptide from
the mutant GH mRNA. Microsatellite analysis indicated that the mutation
arose independently in each family. In 1 family, the finding that
neither grandparent had the mutation suggests that it arose de novo.

Hayashi et al. (1999) identified 2 mutations in Japanese patients with
IGHD II, G-to-A transitions at the first (mutA) and fifth (mutE;
139250.0014) nucleotides of intron 3. GH1 mRNAs skipping exon 3 were
transcribed from both mutant genes. The authors studied the synthesis
and secretion of GH encoded by the mutant GH1 genes and tested whether
inhibition of wildtype GH secretion by mutant products could be
demonstrated in cultured cell lines. A metabolic labeling study in COS-1
cells revealed that a mutant GH with a reduced molecular mass was
synthesized from the mutant mRNAs and retained in the cells for at least
6 hours. On the other hand, the wildtype GH was rapidly secreted into
the medium. Coexpression of mutant and wildtype GH did not result in any
inhibition of wildtype GH secretion in COS-1 or HepG2 cells. However,
coexpression of mutant GH resulted in significant inhibition of wildtype
GH secretion in somatotroph-derived MtT/S cells as well as in
adrenocorticotroph-derived AtT-20 cells, without affecting cell
viability. Hayashi et al. (1999) concluded that the dominant-negative
effect of mutant GH on the secretion of wildtype GH is at least in part
responsible for the pathogenesis of IGHD II. They also suggested that
neuroendocrine cell type-specific mechanisms, including intracellular
storage of the secretory proteins, are involved in the inhibition.

Saitoh et al. (1999) described a 1-year-old Japanese boy and his father
with IGHD II, both of whom had a G-to-A transition of the first base of
the donor splice site of intron 3 of the GH1 gene. The mutation occurred
de novo in the father. No unaffected family members had the mutation.

GH1, IVS3, G-C, +1

Binder and Ranke (1995) reported a G-to-C transversion of the first base
of the donor splice site of intron 3 (+1G to C) in a sporadic case of
IGHD II (173100) in a German patient. This mutation was dominant
negative and arose de novo. They also reported RT-PCR data suggesting
overexpression of the mutant GH1 allele and speculated that the
dominant-negative effect might occur because of this imbalance in
expression of the mutant and normal alleles. However, Binder et al.
(1996) found equal quantities of transcripts in studies using an RNA
protection assay to determine the relative expression of the intron 3 +1
G-to-C mutant and normal GH1 alleles. In normal pituitary, they found 3
GH1 mRNA species with the variant lacking exon 3, which comprised
approximately 5% of the total GH1 mRNA. In contrast, lymphoblasts from
the proband, who was heterozygous for the transition at intron 1,
contained equal amounts of mRNA with or without exon 3. Furthermore,
secreted GH1, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was present
in equal concentrations in media from normal and mutant cells. Thus, GH1
mRNA lacking exon 3 was expressed in proportion to the dosage of the
mutant gene, and dominant-negative effects on GH1 secretion were not
seen in lymphoblasts. Their findings are compatible with a
dominant-negative mechanism involving interaction between normal and
mutant proteins in secretory vesicles of somatotropes, as suggested by
Cogan et al. (1995).

.0011
ISOLATED GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY, TYPE II
GH1, IVS3, G-A, +28

Cogan et al. (1997) reported 2 intron 3 mutations in 2 unrelated
kindreds with autosomal dominant growth hormone deficiency (173100).
These mutations perturbed splicing and caused exon 3 skipping; however,
the mutations did not occur within the intron 3 branch consensus sites
or the 5-prime or 3-prime splice sites. Instead, these mutations
deranged sequences homologous to XGGG repeats that regulate alternative
mRNA splicing in other genes. Eukaryotic pre-mRNA splicing is regulated
by consensus sequences at the intron boundaries and branch site.
Sirand-Pugnet et al. (1995) demonstrated the importance of an additional
intronic sequence, an (A/U)GGG repeat in chicken beta-tropomyocin that
is a binding site for a protein required for spliceosome assembly. The
mutations found by Cogan et al. (1997) in the third intron of the GH
gene affected a putative, homologous consensus sequence and disturbed
splicing. The first mutation was a G-to-A transition base 28 of intron 3
and the second deleted 18 bp (del+28-45; 139250.0012) of intron 3 of the
human GH gene. The findings suggested that XGGG repeats may regulate
alternative splicing in the human growth hormone gene and that mutations
of these repeats cause growth hormone deficiency by perturbing
alternative splicing.

See 139250.0011 and Cogan et al. (1997). McCarthy and Phillips (1998)
presented evidence that this mutation and the G-to-A transition at
position +28 of IVS3 (139250.0011) disturb an intron splice enhancer
(ISE) that is critical for the proper splicing of transcripts of the GH1
gene.

KOWARSKI SYNDROME
GH1, ASP112GLY

In a child presenting with short stature, Takahashi et al. (1997)
demonstrated a biologically inactive growth hormone (262650) resulting
from a heterozygous single-base substitution (A to G) in exon 4 of the
GH1 gene. This change resulted in an asp112-to-gly amino acid
substitution. At age 3 years, the girl's height was 3.6 standard
deviations below the mean for age and sex. Bone age was delayed by 1.5
years. She had a prominent forehead and a hypoplastic nasal bridge with
normal body proportions. She showed lack of growth hormone action
despite high immunoassayable GH levels in serum and marked catch-up
growth to exogenous GH administration. Results of other studies were
compatible with the production of a bioinactive GH, which prevented
dimerization of the growth hormone receptor, a crucial step in GH signal
transduction.

GH1, IVS3, G-A, +5

In a father and his 2 daughters with autosomal dominant isolated growth
hormone deficiency (173100), Kamijo et al. (1999) found a G-to-A
transition at the fifth base of intron 3 of the GH1 gene. The paternal
grandparents did not show the mutation, indicating that it was a new
mutation in the case of the father. Kamijo et al. (1999) studied 2 other
(sporadic) cases of IGHD II. It is curious and undoubtedly significant
that so many mutations have been found in the splice donor site of IVS3
in cases of isolated growth hormone deficiency type II.

ISOLATED GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY, TYPE IB
GH1, IVS4, G-C, +5

Abdul-Latif et al. (2000) identified an extended, highly inbred Bedouin
kindred with IGHD that clinically fulfilled the criteria for type IB
(612781). Molecular studies demonstrated a novel mutation in the GH1
gene: a G-to-C transversion of the fifth base of intron 4, which
appeared to cause GH deficiency through the use of a cryptic splice site
and, consequently, formation of a different protein. Clinical
observations suggested that apparently healthy, non-GH-deficient
individuals in this family were of relatively short stature. Leiberman
et al. (2000) correlated height measurements of potential heterozygotes
with carrier status for the newly identified mutation. Indeed, they
found that carriers of the mutant allele in heterozygous state had
significantly shorter stature than normal homozygotes. They found that
11 of 33 (33%) of heterozygotes, but only 1 of 17 (5.9%) of normal
homozygotes had their height at 2 or more standard deviations below the
mean. Overall, 48.5% of studied heterozygotes were found to be of
appreciably short stature with height at or lower than the 5th centile,
whereas only 5.9% of the normal homozygotes fell into that range (P less
than 0.004).

ISOLATED GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY, TYPE II
GH1, EX3, A-G, +5

Moseley et al. (2002) reported an A-to-G transition of the fifth base of
exon 3 (exon 3+5A-G) in affected individuals from an IGHD II (173100)
family. This mutation disrupts a (GAA)n exon splice enhancer (ESE) motif
immediately following the weak IVS2 3-prime splice site. The mutation
also destroys a MboII site used to demonstrate heterozygosity in all
affected family members. To determine the effect of ESE mutations on GH
mRNA processing, GH3 cells were transfected with expression constructs
containing the normal ESE, +5A-G, or other ESE mutations, and cDNAs
derived from the resulting GH mRNAs were sequenced. All ESE mutations
studied reduced activation of the IVS2 3-prime splice site and caused
either partial exon 3 skipping, due to activation of an exon 3 +45
cryptic 3-prime splice site, or complete exon 3 skipping. Partial or
complete exon 3 skipping led to loss of the codons for amino acids 32-46
or 32-71, respectively, of the mature GH protein. They concluded that
the exon 3 +5A-G mutation causes IGHD II because it perturbs an ESE
required for GH splicing.

.0017
ISOLATED GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY, TYPE II
GH1, EX3DEL

In affected members of a Japanese family with autosomal dominant
isolated growth hormone deficiency (173100), Takahashi et al. (2002)
found a heterozygous G-to-T transversion at the first 5-prime site
nucleotide of exon 3. Analysis of the GH1 cDNA, synthesized from
lymphoblasts of the patients, revealed an abnormally short transcript as
well as a normal-sized transcript. Direct sequencing of the abnormal
transcript showed that it completely lacked exon 3. In IGHD II, several
heterozygous mutations have been reported at the donor splice site in
intron 3 of the GH1 gene or inside intron 3 (e.g., 139250.0007,
139250.0009, 139250.0010), which cause aberrant growth hormone mRNA
splicing, resulting in the deletion of exon 3. Loss of exon 3 results in
lack of amino acid residues 32 to 71 in the mature growth hormone
protein. This mutant growth hormone exerts a dominant-negative effect on
the secretion of mature normal growth hormone protein. Thus, in the
family reported by Takahashi et al. (2002), the G-to-T transversion at
the first nucleotide resulted in deletion of exon 3 and caused growth
hormone deficiency. Takahashi et al. (2002) suggested that the first
nucleotide of exon 3 is critical for the splicing of GH1 mRNA.

GH1, IVS2, A-T, -2

Fofanova et al. (2003) studied mutations in 28 children from 26 families
with total IGHD living in Russia. They found 3 dominant-negative
mutations causing IGHD type II (173100): 1) an A-to-T transversion of
the second base of the 3-prime acceptor splice site of intron 2 (IVS2
-2A-T); 2) a T-to-C transition of the second base of the 5-prime donor
splice site of intron 3 (IVS3 +2T-C; 139250.0019); 3) and a G-to-A
transition of the first base of the 5-prime donor splice site of intron
3 (IVS3 +1G-A; 139250.0009). The IVS -2A-T mutation was the first
identified mutation in intron 2 of GH1. The authors concluded that the
5-prime donor splice site of intron 3 of GH1 is a mutation hotspot, and
the IVS3 +1G-A mutation can be considered to be a common molecular
defect in IGHD II in Russian patients.

KOWARSKI SYNDROME
GH1, CYS53SER

In a Serbian patient with short stature and bioinactive growth hormone
(Kowarski syndrome; 262650) Besson et al. (2005) detected a homozygous
cys53-to-ser (C53S) mutation in the GH1 gene. The mutation arose from a
G-to-C transversion at nucleotide position 705 (G705C). The
phenotypically normal first-cousin parents were heterozygous for the
mutation. This mutation was predicted to lead to the absence of the
disulfide bridge cys53 to cys165. In GH receptor (GHR; 600946) binding
and Jak2 (147796)/Stat5 (601511) activation experiments, Besson et al.
(2005) observed that at physiologic concentrations (3-50 ng/ml), both
GHR binding and Jak2/Stat5 signaling pathway activation were
significantly reduced in the mutant GH-C53S, compared with wildtype.
Higher concentrations (400 ng/ml) were required for this mutant to
elicit responses similar to wildtype GH. Besson et al. (2005) concluded
that the absence of the disulfide bridge cys53 to cys165 affects the
binding affinity of GH for the GHR and subsequently the potency of GH to
activate the Jak2/Stat5 signaling pathway.

GH1, IVS3, 22-BP DEL

In a 2-year-old child and her mother with severe growth failure at
diagnosis (IGHD II; 173100) (-5.8 and -6.9 SD score, respectively),
Vivenza et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous 22-bp deletion in IVS3
of the GH1 gene, designated IVS3del+56-77, removing the putative branch
point sequence (BPS). Both patients showed 2 principal mRNA species
approximately in equal amount, i.e., a full-length species encoded by
the normal allele, and an aberrant splicing product with the skipping of
exon 3 encoded by the mutant allele. Their clinical phenotype correlated
with that observed in other IGHD II patients harboring splice site
mutations.

ISOLATED GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY, TYPE II
GH1, ARG183HIS

In a large kindred with dominant growth hormone deficiency (IGHD II;
173100) Gertner et al. (1998) detected a heterozygous G-to-A transition
at nucleotide 6664 in exon 5 of the GH1 gene, resulting in an
arg183-to-his substitution (R183H).

Hess et al. (2007) studied the phenotype-genotype correlation of
subjects with IGHD II caused by a R183H mutation in the GH1 gene in 34
affected members of 2 large families. Twenty-four of the 52 members from
family 1 and 10 of the 14 from family 2 carried the same mutation in a
heterozygous state. The affected subjects in family 1 were significantly
shorter (-2.6 vs -0.1 standard deviation score (SDS), p less than
0.0001) and had significantly lower IGF1 (147440) serum levels (-1.9 vs
-0.5 SDS, p less than 0.0001), compared with family members with a
normal genotype. The affected adults exhibited great variability in
their stature, ranging from -4.5 to -1.0 SD (mean -2.8 SDS), with 5
members being of normal height (greater than -2 SDS). Twelve children
were diagnosed with IGHD. Two affected children had normal peak GH
levels, although 1 of these subsequently demonstrated GH insufficiency.
The affected children from both families exhibited large variability in
their height, growth velocity, delay in bone age, age at diagnosis, peak
GH response, and IGF1 levels. Hess et al. (2007) concluded that these
detailed phenotypic analyses show the variable expressivity of patients
bearing the R183H mutation, reflecting the spectrum of GH deficiency in
affected patients, even within families, and the presence of additional
genes modifying height determination.

ISOLATED GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY, TYPE II
GH1, EX3, A-C, +2

In 2 independent pedigrees with IGHD II (173100), Petkovic et al. (2007)
identified a heterozygous splice enhancer mutation in exon 3, exon
3+2A-C, that encodes a glutamic acid-to-alanine change at position 32 in
the GH protein (E32A) and leads to missplicing at the mRNA level,
producing large amounts of the 17.5-kD GH isoform. Mouse pituitary cells
coexpressing both wildtype and mutant GH-E32A protein presented a
significant reduction in cell proliferation as well as GH production
after forskolin stimulation when compared with the cells expressing
wildtype GH. These results were complemented with confocal microscopy
analysis, which revealed a significant reduction of the GH-E32A-derived
isoform colocalized with secretory granules, compared with wildtype GH.
Petkovic et al. (2007) concluded that the GH-E32A mutation, which
occurred in the exon splice enhancer (ESE1), weakens recognition of exon
3 directly, and therefore increases production of the exon 3-skipped
17.5-kD GH isoform in relation to the 22-kD, wildtype GH isoform.

GH1, EX3, G-A, +1

In affected members of a 4-generation family segregating autosomal
dominant growth hormone deficiency (173100), Shariat et al. (2008)
identified heterozygosity for a +1G-A transition in exon 3 of the GH
gene. The change was predicted to encode a glu32-to-lys (E32K)
substitution; however, transfection studies showed that when the mutant
was expressed, there was an approximately 6-fold increase in skipping of
exon 3 compared to wildtype (39% and 6%, respectively). Functional
analysis revealed that the variant weakens the 3-prime splice site and
simultaneously disrupts a splicing enhancer located within the first 7
bases of exon 3.

606420	TITLE *606420 ENGULFMENT AND CELL MOTILITY GENE 1; ELMO1
;;CED12, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, 1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The C. elegans genes Ced2, Ced5, and Ced10 and their mammalian homologs
CRKII (164762), DOCK180 (601403), and RAC1 (602048), respectively,
mediate cytoskeletal rearrangements during phagocytosis of apoptotic
cells and cell motility. Gumienny et al. (2001) identified Ced12, an
additional member of the C. elegans signaling pathway, and mouse and
human Ced12 homologs, which they termed ELMO1, ELMO2 (606421), and ELMO3
(606422). They cloned a full-length human cDNA encoding ELMO1 from a
macrophage cDNA library. The predicted 727-amino acid ELMO1 polypeptide
is 44% similar to C. elegans Ced12, 75% identical to ELMO2, and 98%
identical to mouse Elmo1. Northern blot analysis detected wide
expression of a 4.2-kb ELMO1 transcript. Computer analysis predicted
that ELMO1 and ELMO2 are soluble cytoplasmic proteins.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gumienny et al. (2001) mapped the ELMO1
gene to chromosome 7.

GENE FUNCTION

Gumienny et al. (2001) determined that in C. elegans, Ced12 is required
for engulfment of dying cells and for cell migrations. In mammalian
cells, ELMO1 functionally cooperated with CRKII and DOCK180 to promote
phagocytosis and cell shape changes. Ced12/ELMO1 bound directly to
Ced5/DOCK180. This evolutionarily conserved complex stimulated a
Rac-GEF, leading to RAC1 activation and cytoskeletal rearrangements.
These studies identified Ced12/ELMO as an upstream regulator of RAC1
that affects engulfment and cell migration from C. elegans to mammals.

Using mass spectrometric analysis, Scott et al. (2002) identified 25
potential binding partners in a human monocyte cell line for the SH3
domain of HCK (142370). Analysis with purified proteins and in intact
cells confirmed the interactions with WIP (WIPF1; 602357), WASP (WAS;
300392), and ELMO1. ELMO1 was heavily tyrosine phosphorylated in cells
coexpressing HCK and ELMO1, suggesting that ELMO1 is a HCK substrate.
Pull-down analysis showed that binding of ELMO1 to the HCK SH3 domain
could be inhibited by polyproline peptides, indicating that an ELMO1
polyproline motif interacts with HCK. Scott et al. (2002) concluded that
WIP, WASP, and ELMO1 may be activators or effectors of HCK.

Park et al. (2007) identified brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor-1
(BAI1; 602682) as a receptor upstream of ELMO and as a receptor that can
bind phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells. BAI1 is a 7-transmembrane
protein belonging to the adhesion-type G protein-coupled receptor family
with an extended extracellular region. Park et al. (2007) showed that
BAI1 functions as an engulfment receptor in both the recognition and
subsequent internalization of apoptotic cells. Through multiple lines of
investigation, Park et al. (2007) identified phosphatidylserine, a key
'eat-me' signal exposed on apoptotic cells, as a ligand for BAI1. The
thrombospondin type 1 (188060) repeats within the extracellular region
of BAI1 mediate direct binding to phosphatidylserine. As with
intracellular signaling, BAI1 forms a trimeric complex with ELMO and
Dock180, and functional studies suggested that BAI1 cooperates with
ELMO/Dock180/Rac to promote maximal engulfment of apoptotic cells. Last,
Park et al. (2007) found that decreased BAI1 expression or interference
with BAI1 function inhibited the engulfment of apoptotic targets ex vivo
and in vivo. Thus, Park et al. (2007) concluded that BAI1 is a
phosphatidylserine recognition receptor that can directly recruit a
Rac-GEF complex to mediate the uptake of apoptotic cells.

Shimazaki et al. (2005) performed in situ hybridization using kidney
from normal and diabetic mice and observed ELMO1 expression primarily in
tubular and glomerular epithelial cells that was weak in normal kidney
but clearly elevated in diabetic kidney. In vitro analysis revealed
increased ELMO1 expression in cells cultured under high glucose
conditions compared to those under normal glucose conditions. Expression
of extracellular matrix protein genes such as type I collagen (120150)
and fibronectin (135600) was increased in cells overexpressing ELMO1,
whereas the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (see MMP2, 120360)
was decreased.

Thirty percent of all cortical interneurons arise from a relatively
novel source within the ventral telencephalon, the caudal ganglionic
eminence (CGE) (summary by De Marco Garcia et al., 2011). Owing to their
late birth date, these interneurons populate the cortex only after the
majority of other interneurons and pyramidal cells are already in place
and have started to functionally integrate. De Marco Garcia et al.
(2011) demonstrated in mice that for CGE-derived reelin
(600514)-positive and calretinin (114051)-positive, but not vasoactive
intestinal peptide (VIP; 192320)-positive, interneurons, activity is
essential before postnatal day 3 for correct migration, and that after
postnatal day 3, glutamate-mediated activity controls the development of
their axons and dendrites. Furthermore, De Marco Garcia et al. (2011)
showed that Elmo1, a target of the transcription factor distal-less
homeobox-1 (Dlx1; 600029), is selectively expressed in reelin-positive
and calretinin-positive interneurons and is both necessary and
sufficient for activity-dependent interneuron migration. De Marco Garcia
et al. (2011) concluded that their findings revealed a selective
requirement for activity in shaping the cortical integration of specific
neuronal subtypes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of a possible association between microvascular
complications of diabetes and variation in the ELMO1 gene, see MVCD1
(603933).

ANIMAL MODEL

Elliott et al. (2010) generated mice deficient in Elmo1 by targeted
disruption and found them, unexpectedly, to be viable and grossly
normal. However, Elmo1-null mice had a striking testicular pathology,
with disrupted seminiferous epithelium, multinucleated giant cells,
uncleared apoptotic germ cells, and decreased sperm output. Subsequent
in vitro and in vivo analyses revealed a crucial role for Elmo1 in the
phagocytic clearance of apoptotic germ cells by Sertoli cells lining the
seminiferous epithelium. The engulfment receptor Bai1 and Rac1 (602048),
upstream and downstream of Elmo1, respectively, were also important for
Sertoli cell-mediated engulfment. Elliott et al. (2010) concluded that
collectively, their findings uncovered a selective requirement for ELMO1
Sertoli cell-mediated removal of apoptotic germ cells and made a
compelling case for a relationship between engulfment and tissue
homeostasis in vivo.

611574	TITLE *611574 SPHINGOMYELIN SYNTHASE 2; SGMS2
;;SMS2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sphingomyelin (SM) is a major component of plasma membranes. It is
preferentially concentrated in the outer leaflet and has a role in the
formation of lipid rafts. SM synthases (EC 2.7.8.27), such as SGMS2,
produce SM in the lumen of the Golgi and on the cell surface through the
transfer of phosphocholine from phosphatidylcholine onto ceramide,
yielding diacylglycerol as a side product (Huitema et al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences encoding motifs characteristic of
SM synthases, Huitema et al. (2004) identified SGMS2, which they called
SMS2. The deduced 366-amino acid protein contains 5 membrane-spanning
alpha helices connected by hydrophilic extramembrane loops as well as 4
highly conserved motifs, designated D1 to D4. Protease protection
analysis of transfected HeLa cells revealed that the C terminus was
cytosolic, indicating that the putative active site residues are in the
extracellular space. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected a
1.9-kb transcript in brain, heart, kidney, liver, muscle, and stomach.
SGMS2 localized primarily to the plasma membrane as well as to the Golgi
apparatus.

GENE FUNCTION

By heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae, Huitema et al. (2004)
showed that human SGMS2 formed SM in the presence of choline and
ceramide. Both phosphatidylcholine and SM itself were utilized as
phosphorylcholine group donors, but lysophosphatidylcholine was a very
poor substrate, and other donors, including other phospholipids, did not
support SM formation. Huitema et al. (2004) concluded that SGMS2
requires 2 fatty chains on the phosphocholine donor molecule for it to
be utilized as a substrate. SGMS2 could also catalyze the reverse
reaction.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SGMS2
gene to chromosome 4 (TMAP STS-H01973).

602352	TITLE *602352 GONADOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE 2; GNRH2
DESCRIPTION Gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GNRH1; 152760) is a decapeptide widely
known for its role in regulating reproduction by serving as a signal
from the hypothalamus to pituitary gonadotropes. This function for GNRH1
has been highly conserved during 500 million years of vertebrate
evolution despite the fact that its amino acid sequence varies by 50%.
In addition to the hypothalamic GNRH1 of variable sequence, many
vertebrate species express a second, invariant GNRH form, GNRH-II (or
GNRH2), with the primary structure
gln-his-trp-ser-his-gly-trp-tyr-pro-gly. Antibody staining demonstrates
GNRH2 in the midbrain of all species where its location has been
described (Kasten et al., 1996). Furthermore, nucleic acid probes have
been used to identify GNRH2 expression in the midbrain of several fish
species and one mammal. White et al. (1998) showed that a gene encoding
GNRH2 is expressed in humans and is located on chromosome 20p13,
distinct from the GNRH1 gene on 8p21-p11.2. The genomic and mRNA
structures of GNRH2 parallel those of GNRH1. However, in contrast to
GNRH1, GNRH2 is expressed at significantly higher levels outside the
brain (up to 30-fold), particularly in the kidney, bone marrow, and
prostate. The widespread expression of GNRH2 suggests it may have
multiple functions. Molecular phylogenetic analysis shows that GNRH2 is
likely the result of a duplication before the appearance of vertebrates,
and predicts the existence of a third GNRH form in humans and other
vertebrates. White et al. (1998) used fluorescence in situ hybridization
to map GNRH2 to 20p13.

Chen et al. (2002) found that human normal and leukemic T cells produce
GNRH2 and GNRH1. Exposure of normal or cancerous human or mouse T cells
to GNRH2 or GNRH1 triggered de novo gene transcription and cell-surface
expression of the laminin receptor (150370), which is involved in
cellular adhesion and migration and in tumor invasion and metastasis.
GNRH2 or GNRH1 also induced adhesion to laminin and chemotaxis toward
SDF1A (600835), and augmented entry in vivo of metastatic T-lymphoma
into the spleen and bone marrow. Homing of normal T cells into specific
organs was reduced in mice lacking GNRH1. A specific GNRH1 receptor
antagonist blocked GNRH1 but not GNRH2-induced effects, which was
suggestive of signaling through distinct receptors. Chen et al. (2002)
suggested that GNRH2 and GNRH1, secreted from nerves or autocrine or
paracrine sources, interact directly with T cells and trigger gene
transcription, adhesion, chemotaxis, and homing to specific organs.

611996	TITLE *611996 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S36; MRPS36
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPS36
is a component of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human MRPS36. The deduced 102-amino acid MRPS36 protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 11.3 kD. Koc et al. (2001) identified
MRPS36 orthologs in mouse, C. elegans, and yeast, but not in Drosophila
or E. coli. Mouse and human MRPS36 share 84.3% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang and Gerstein (2003) mapped the
MRPS36 gene to chromosome 5q12.1. They identified 6 MRPS36 pseudogenes
scattered throughout the genome.

158372	TITLE *158372 MUCIN 4, TRACHEOBRONCHIAL; MUC4
DESCRIPTION From a lambda-gt11 cDNA library constructed from human tracheobronchial
mucosa, Porchet et al. (1991) isolated a partial cDNA clone that reacted
with a polyclonal antiserum raised to chemically deglycosylated pronase
glycopeptides from human bronchial mucins. The novel tracheobronchial
mucin gene, referred to as mucin 4, was mapped to chromosome 3 by
analysis of somatic cell hybrids. By in situ hybridization, Van Cong et
al. (1991) mapped MUC4 to 3q29. They also demonstrated a VNTR
polymorphism useful for family linkage studies. The full report was
given by Gross et al. (1992). (Note that Nguyen Van Cong's name is
sometimes published as Nguyen, V. C. rather than Van Cong, N. Nguyen is
indeed the surname.)

Using real-time RT-PCR, Moehle et al. (2006) found that MUC4 was highly
expressed in adult trachea and colon, and in fetal lung. Expression was
moderate in adult testis, prostate, mammary gland, lung and stomach, and
weak in spinal cord, thymus, and salivary gland. No expression was
detected in other tissues examined.

;;FGFR1 ONCOGENE PARTNER; FOP
FOP/FGFR1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using 5-prime RACE with FGFR1 primers on t(6;8) malignant cell cDNA,
followed by database searches, Popovici et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA
encoding FOP from a PAC localized on 6q27. The deduced 399-amino acid,
hydrophilic FOP protein has N- and C-terminal alpha helices harboring
leucine-rich repeats. Popovici et al. (1999) identified additional cDNAs
encoding a variant 331-amino acid protein, in which exon 11 is not
spliced out, resulting in a truncation due to an in-frame stop codon.
EST database searches suggested that FOP may be a member of a novel gene
family. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of major
FOP transcripts of 1.2 and 1.7 kb. Highest expression, with an
additional 3.0-kb transcript, was found in heart. RT-PCR analysis
detected expression in hematopoietic cells and various malignant cell
lines.

- FOP-FGFR1 Fusion Gene

The 8p11 myeloproliferative disorder (613523) is caused by
translocations involving the tyrosine kinase-bearing FGFR1 gene (136350)
on chromosome 8p11 and various partner genes. Using RT-PCR, Popovici et
al. (1999) detected both FGFR1-FOP and FOP-FGFR1 fusion transcripts,
with the break occurring in intron 8 of FGFR1 or intron 6 of FOP, in 2
patients with the disorder but not in normal subjects or those with
other tumors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Popovici et al. (1999) determined that the FOP gene contains 13 exons
and spans more than 40 kb.

611605	TITLE *611605 ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM LIPID RAFT-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; ERLIN2
;;SPFH DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; SPFH2;;
CHROMOSOME 8 OPEN READING FRAME 2; C8ORF2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, followed by PCR and RACE of adult and
fetal cDNA libraries, Ikegawa et al. (1999) cloned 2 splice variants of
ERLIN2, which they designated C8ORF2. The deduced 339- and 152-amino
acid proteins share the first 141 N-terminal amino acids, then diverge.
Both proteins have an N-glycosylation site and type-2 membrane topology,
and the longer protein has a lysine- and glutamic acid-rich region.
Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of 1.6- and 2.5-kb
transcripts; a minor 4.4-kb transcript was also observed.

Using monoclonal antibodies to human lipid raft proteins, Browman et al.
(2006) identified ERLIN1 (611604) and ERLIN2 as components of lipid
rafts. Immunohistochemical analysis of endogenous and
fluorescence-tagged proteins revealed that ERLIN1 and ERLIN2 localized
specifically to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope. The
2 proteins share 83% identity, and both contain a conserved prohibitin
(PHB; 176705) homology domain of about 160 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

The ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway removes aberrant proteins
and metabolically regulated native proteins from the ER. Pearce et al.
(2007) found that SPFH2 associated rapidly with activated IP3 receptors
(see IP3R1; 147265), which are substrates for the ERAD pathway, in
various mammalian cell lines. A proportion of SPFH2 associated with
several components of the ERAD pathway, and RNA interference-mediated
depletion of SPFH2 inhibited polyubiquitination and degradation of IP3R1
and turnover of model ERAD substrates. Pearce et al. (2007) concluded
that SPFH2 is a key ERAD pathway component that may act as a substrate
recognition factor.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ikegawa et al. (1999) determined that the ERLIN2 gene contains 16 exons
and spans more than 16.5 kb. The first 4 exons encode alternative
5-prime UTRs, exon 5 contains the initiating methionine, and exons 10
and 16 encode alternative 3-prime UTRs.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ikegawa et al. (1999) mapped the ERLIN2
gene to chromosome 8p11.2.

CYTOGENETICS

By autozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene sequencing in a
consanguineous Saudi family with complicated SPG18 (611225), Alazami et
al. (2011) identified a homozygous 20-kb deletion on chromosome 8, with
the distal breakpoint near physical position 37,694,857 (NCBI36) and the
proximal breakpoint near 37,714,575 immediately upstream of exon 2 of
the ERLIN2 gene. This 20-kb interval spans 2 protein-coding genes,
ERLIN2 and FLJ34378. RT-PCR analysis of patient lymphoblasts showed loss
of ERLIN2 transcription, consistent with a null allele. Alazami et al.
(2011) noted that ERLIN2 is involved in the endoplasmic
reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, and postulated that
loss of ERLIN2 may result in persistent activation of IP3 signaling and
neuronal channel activity since ERAD normally degrades IP3 receptors.
Alazami et al. (2011) concluded that ERLIN2 depletion caused the
phenotype, although they could not exclude a role for FLJ34378.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with autosomal
recessive spastic paraplegia-18 (SPG18; 611225), Yildirim et al. (2011)
identified a truncation mutation in the ERLIN2 gene (611605.0001) by
linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing. The authors
termed the disorder 'intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, and
contractures (IDMDC).' Affected individuals presented between ages 6
months and 2 years with an arrest and regression of motor function. They
developed progressive severe contractures of all joints, resulting in
severe motor disability and a fixed position. All had severe
intellectual disability, and none could speak, read, or write. Features
suggestive of spasticity included hyperactive reflexes, ankle clonus,
and extensor plantar responses, but the neurologic examination was
difficult to perform in most. Electron microscopy of white blood cells
from 2 affected sibs showed large membrane-bound vacuoles containing
flocculent material in 7 to 10% of cells, and these vacuoles appeared to

SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 18, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
ERLIN2, 2-BP INS, 812AC

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with autosomal
recessive intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, and contractures,
or spastic paraplegia-18 (SPG18; 611225), Yildirim et al. (2011)
identified a 2-bp insertion (812insAC) in exon 11 of the ERLIN2 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination in the
oligomerization domain. The protein was predicted to be truncated by
20%, but the mutant transcript did not appear to undergo
nonsense-mediated decay. The mutation was not found in 109 control
individuals.

ATXN1, ALTERNATIVE READING FRAME, INCLUDED;;
ALT-ATXN1, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATXN1 binds RNA, associates with large protein complexes, and interacts
with a vast network of proteins. ATXN1 is thought to be involved in
transcriptional repression and to regulate Notch (see 190198)- and
Capicua (CIC; 612082)-controlled developmental processes (summary by
Bergeron et al., 2013).

CLONING

Using DNA fragments from a cosmid clone shown to contain the CAG
trinucleotide repeat identified as the cause of spinocerebellar ataxia-1
(SCA1; 164400) by Orr et al. (1993), Banfi et al. (1994) screened 2
human fetal brain and 1 human adult cerebellar cDNA libraries to isolate
the ATXN1 transcript. Banfi et al. (1994) demonstrated that the ATXN1
gene encodes an 816-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 87 kD.
The (CAG)n repeat, coding for a polyglutamine tract, lies within the
coding region, and the protein is transcribed from both the wildtype and
the CAG-expanded ATXN1 allele.

Mizutani et al. (2005) stated that the deduced 816-amino acid ATXN1
protein has an N-terminal BOAT (ATXN1L; 614301) and ataxin-1 (NBA)
domain, followed by the polyglutamine tract, a self-association region
(SAR), and a C-terminal ATXN1 and HBP1 (AXH) domain.

By immunoblot analysis, Servadio et al. (1995) demonstrated that the
ATXN1 protein was present in various brain regions and in nonneuronal
tissues, such as heart, skeletal muscle, and liver. Whereas it was
located predominantly in cytoplasm in nonneuronal tissue, it was found
in nuclei in neurons of the basal ganglia, pons, and cortex, and in both
cytoplasm and nuclei of Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Servadio et
al. (1995) found that the protein varied in its size and electrophoretic
migration properties according to the size of the (CAG)n repeat.

- Alternative ATXN1

Bergeron et al. (2013) identified an alternative translation initiation
codon in the +3 reading frame of ATXN1. Translation of alternative ATXN1
(ALT-ATXN1) begins 30 nucleotides downstream of the initiation codon of
full-length ATXN1 and ends at nucleotide 587, just prior to the CAG
repeat region. The deduced 185-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 21 kD. ALT-ATXN1 contains 26 proline residues
distributed throughout the molecule, and it has a putative N-terminal
proline-lysine (PY)-type nuclear localization signal. ALT-ATXN1 shares
no sequence similarity with ATXN1. Bergeron et al. (2013) also
identified a second putative 151-amino acid ALT-ATXN1 protein that is
N-terminally truncated compared with the longer ALT-ATXN1 protein.
Database analysis revealed orthologs of ALT-ATXN1 in several mammalian
species and in chicken. Western blot analysis detected both ATXN1 and
ALT-ATXN1 in normal human cerebellum and in primary cells cultured from
a glioblastoma patient. Epitope-tagged ALT-ATXN1 colocalized with ATXN1
in nuclear inclusions and in the nucleoplasm of transfected cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Banfi et al. (1994) determined that ATXN1 gene spans 450 kb of genomic
DNA and is organized into 9 exons. The first 7 fall in the 5-prime
untranslated region, whereas the last 2 contain the coding region and a
7,277 bp 3-prime untranslated region. The first 4 noncoding exons
undergo alternative splicing in several tissues. These features suggest
that the transcriptional and translational regulation of ataxin-1 may be
complex.

MAPPING

Detailed linkage studies of families with SCA1 established the disease
locus on chromosome 6 (see 164400), and Volz et al. (1994) reported that
the ATXN1 gene had been mapped to 6p23 by in situ hybridization.

Servadio et al. (1995) mapped the mouse homolog of the ATXN1 gene to
mouse chromosome 13.

GENE FUNCTION

Servadio et al. (1995) found that ATXN1 protein exhibited a normal
nuclear/cytoplasmic localization in cultured cells and tissues from
individuals with SCA1. Thus, the data showed that the mutant expanded
ATXN1 alleles are faithfully translated into proteins of apparently
normal stability and distribution.

Cummings et al. (1999) found that wildtype ataxin-1 and mutant ataxin-1
with an expanded polyglutamine tract were polyubiquitinated equally well
in transfected HeLa cells in vitro, but the mutant form was 3 times more
resistant to degradation. Inhibiting proteasomal degradation promoted
aggregation of mutant ataxin-1. Mouse Purkinje cells expressing mutant
ataxin-1 but not the ubiquitin-protein ligase Ube3a (601623) showed
fewer ubiquitin-positive nuclear inclusions than Sca1 mice, but the
Purkinje cell pathology was markedly worse. Cummings et al. (1999)
concluded that nuclear inclusions are not necessary to induce
neurodegeneration, but impaired proteasomal degradation of mutant
ataxin-1 may contribute to SCA1 pathogenesis.

Davidson et al. (2000) identified an ataxin-1-interacting protein, A1U
(605440), that localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm of transfected
COS-1 cells. A1U contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like region and has
substantial homology to human UBQLN2 (300264), a protein that binds the
ATPase domain of the HSP70-like Stch protein (601100). The authors
suggested that A1U may link ataxin-1 with the chaperone and
ubiquitin/proteasome pathways, and that ataxin-1 may function in the
formation and regulation of multimeric protein complexes within the
nucleus.

Using an in vitro RNA-binding assay, Yue et al. (2001) demonstrated that
ataxin-1 binds RNA, and that this binding diminishes as the length of
its polyglutamine tract increases. The authors suggested that ataxin-1
plays a role in RNA metabolism and that the expansion of the
polyglutamine tract may alter this function.

Okazawa et al. (2002) proposed that modified transcription may underlie
polyglutamine-mediated pathology and that polyglutamine-binding
protein-1 (PQBP1; 300463) may be involved in the pathology of SCA1.
Using in vitro and in vivo assays, they showed that interaction between
ataxin-1 and PQBP1 was positively influenced by expanded polyglutamine
sequences. In immunoprecipitation experiments, mutant ataxin-1 enhanced
interaction between PQBP1 and the RNA polymerase II (pol II) large
subunit (180660), and the authors proposed that a ternary complex is
formed by PQBP1 in the presence of mutant ataxin-1. PQBP1 and mutant
ataxin-1 acted cooperatively in cell lines to repress transcription and
induce cell death. Okazawa et al. (2002) hypothesized that high
expression of PQBP1 in the cerebellum promotes mutant ataxin-1-induced
cell death, contributing to the region-specific neurodegeneration seen
in SCA1 patient tissues.

To investigate the effect of expanded poly(Q) repeats on
ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent proteolysis, Verhoef et al. (2002)
targeted these proteins for proteasomal degradation by the introduction
of an N-end rule degradation signal (i.e., N-terminal arginine residue).
While soluble poly(Q) proteins were degraded, they resisted proteasomal
degradation once present in the aggregates. Stabilization was also
observed for proteins that are co-aggregated via interaction with the
expanded poly(Q) domain. Introduction of a degradation signal in
ataxin-1/Q92 reduced the incidence of nuclear inclusions and the
cellular toxicity, conceivably by accelerating the clearance of the
soluble substrate.

Chen et al. (2003) discovered that the 14-3-3 protein (see 113508), a
multifunctional regulatory molecule, mediates the neurotoxicity of
ataxin-1 by binding and stabilizing it, thereby slowing its normal
degradation. The association of ataxin-1 with 14-3-3 was found to be
regulated by AKT (164730) phosphorylation, and in a Drosophila model of
SCA1, both 14-3-3 and Akt modulated neurodegeneration. The authors
concluded that their finding that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt
signaling and 14-3-3 cooperate to modulate the neurotoxicity of ataxin-1
provides insight into SCA1 pathogenesis and identifies potential targets
for therapeutic intervention.

The pathologic hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders associated with
expanded polyglutamine repeats (polyQ) is the cytoplasmic or
intranuclear accumulation of polyglutamine inclusions. Emamian et al.
(2003) noted that the expanded tract may influence the behavior of the
host protein and that elements of the protein outside of the
polyglutamine tract may influence the course of disease. In vitro,
Emamian et al. (2003) found that ataxin-1 is phosphorylated at ser776
and that most cells expressing ataxin-1(82Q)-ser776 contained large
nuclear inclusions (60%), compared to cells expressing a mutant
ataxin-1(82Q)-ala776 (less than 0.1%). Ataxin-1(82Q)-ala776 transgenic
mice expressed the protein in Purkinje cell nuclei, but progression and
manifestations of disease were substantially reduced. The authors
concluded that polyglutamine tract expansion and intranuclear
localization are not sufficient to induce disease, and that the ser776
phosphorylation site has a critical role in SCA1 pathogenesis.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Hong et al. (2003) found that ataxin-1
interacted with coilin (COIL; 600272). Mutation analysis indicated that
the C-terminal regions of both proteins mediated the interaction. HeLa
cells cotransfected with ataxin-1 and coilin showed colocalization of
the 2 proteins in aggregates in the nucleoplasm. A mutant form of
ataxin-1 containing a polyglutamine expansion also interacted with
coilin and localized with some coiled bodies, but it had no effect on
their normal nuclear distribution.

Skinner et al. (1997) and Matilla et al. (1997) showed that, in
transfected cells, both wildtype (30 glutamines) and mutant (82
glutamines) Atx1 localized to small dense nuclear bodies. Tsai et al.
(2004) demonstrated that Atx1 interacts with the transcriptional
corepressor SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone
receptors; 600848) and with histone deacetylase-3 (HDAC3; 605166). Atx1
binds chromosomes and mediates transcriptional repression when tethered
to DNA. Interaction with SMRT-related factors is a conserved feature of
Atx1, because Atx1 also binds SMRTER, a Drosophila cognate of SMRT.
Significantly, mutant Atx1 forms aggregates in Drosophila, and such
mutant Atx1-mediated aggregates sequester SMRTER. Consistently, the
neurodegenerative eye phenotype in Drosophila caused by mutant Atx1 was
enhanced by a Smrter mutation and, conversely, was suppressed by a
chromosomal duplication that contained the wildtype Smrter gene. Tsai et
al. (2004) interpreted their results as suggesting that Atx1 is a
transcriptional factor whose mutant form exerts its deleterious effects
in part by perturbing corepressor-dependent transcriptional pathways.

By yeast 2-hybrid and mutation analysis, Mizutani et al. (2005) showed
that AXH domain of ATXN1 was required for its interaction with SMRT.
Yeast 2-hybrid analysis also showed that ATXN1 interacted with BOAT
(ATXN1L), and Mizutani et al. (2005) confirmed the interaction between
BOAT and ATXN1 in human cell culture and Drosophila. Truncation analysis
showed that the NBA domain of BOAT mediated its self-association and
interaction with ATXN1, whereas the SAR and NBA domains of ATXN1
mediated its self-association and interaction with BOAT. Mutation
analysis and reporter gene assays revealed that the AXH domain of ATXN1
was required for transcriptional repression, likely due to its
interaction with SMRT. Truncation analysis and reporter gene assays
revealed that ATXN1 contains a C-terminal transcriptional repressive
domain, whereas BOAT contains independent N- and C-terminal
transcriptional repressive domains. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed
that endogenous BOAT, SMRT, and ATXN1 interacted in a complex in HeLa
cells. Expression of ATXN1 with a polyglutamine expansion (82Q) caused
an abnormal eye phenotype in Drosophila, and this phenotype was reversed
by coexpression of BOAT. Expression of ATXN1 without the polyglutamine
tract (0Q) also caused an abnormal eye phenotype in Drosophila, although
it was less severe than that caused by ATXN1(82Q). SCA1 mice, which
express human mutant ATXN1 in Purkinje cells, showed reduced expression
of both Boat and Smrt compared with wildtype mice. Mizutani et al.
(2005) hypothesized that BOAT inhibits mutant ATXN1 toxicity by
dimerizing with ATXN1 and reducing mutant ATXN1 self-association.

Lam et al. (2006) examined soluble protein complexes from mouse
cerebellum and found that the majority of wildtype and expanded Atxn1
assembles into large stable complexes containing the transcriptional
repressor Capicua (Cic; 612082). Atxn1 directly bound Cic and modulated
Cic repressor activity in Drosophila and mammalian cells, and its loss
decreased the steady state level of Cic. Interestingly, the S776A
mutation, which abrogates the neurotoxicity of expanded Atxn1,
substantially reduced the association of mutant Atxn1 with Cic in vivo.
Lam et al. (2006) concluded that their data provided insight into the
function of Atxn1 and suggested that the neuropathology of SCA1
(164400), caused by expansion of the ATXN1 polyglutamine tract, depends
on native, not novel, protein interactions. Lam et al. (2006) found that
the majority of CIC associates with ATXN1 in vivo and that ATXN1 binds
CIC through an 8-amino-acid sequence conserved across species.

Using yeast 2-hybrid screens, coaffinity purification analysis of
transfected HEK293 cells, and bioinformatic analysis, Lim et al. (2006)
developed an interaction network for 54 human proteins involved in 23
inherited ataxias. By database analysis, they expanded the core network
to include more distantly related interacting proteins that could
function as genetic modifiers. A majority (18 of 23) of ataxia-causing
proteins interacted either directly or indirectly. ATXN1 showed strong
direct interactions with ATXN2 (601517) and RBPMS (601558), and the
N-terminal portion of ATXN1 was required for interaction with RBPMS.
RBPMS was a main hub in the network and interacted with many proteins,
including 2 cerebellar ataxia-associated proteins, ATN1 (607462) and QK1
(609590). The ATXN1 interactor COIL also interacted with the
ataxia-associated protein puratrophin-1 (PLEKHG4; 609526).

Lim et al. (2008) demonstrated that the expanded polyglutamine tract of
ATXN1 differentially affects the function of the host protein in the
context of different endogenous protein complexes. Polyglutamine
expansion in ATXN1 favors the formation of a particular protein complex
containing RBM17 (606935), contributing to SCA1 neuropathology by means
of a gain-of-function mechanism. Concomitantly, polyglutamine expansion
attenuates the formation and function of another protein complex
containing ATXN1 and capicua, contributing to SCA1 through a partial
loss-of-function mechanism. Lim et al. (2008) concluded that their model
provides mechanistic insight into the molecular pathogenesis of SCA1 as
well as other polyglutamine diseases.

Notch signaling involves proteolytic release of the Notch intracellular
domain (NICD), followed by NICD-dependent gene activation. Tong et al.
(2011) found that expression of human BOAT1 in Drosophila wing disrupted
Notch signaling, leading to wing defects. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis
of HEK293 cells revealed that both BOAT1 and ATXN1 precipitated CBF1
(RBPJ; 147183), which functions as a transcriptional activator when
associated with NICD. Protein pull-down and yeast 2-hybrid analyses
confirmed the interactions and showed that BOAT1 and ATXN1 competed for
CBF1 binding. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that NICD
disrupted CBF1-BOAT/ATXN1 interactions. Reporter gene assays revealed
that both BOAT1 and ATXN1 inhibited CBF1 activity at the HEY1 (602953)
promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Boat1 and
Atxn1, in addition to Smrt, occupied the Hey1 promoter in
differentiating mouse C2C12 myoblasts. Atxn1 bound the Hey1 promoter
transiently, whereas Boat1 and Smrt remained bound to the Hey1 promoter
under the same conditions. Tong et al. (2011) concluded that BOAT1 and
ATXN1 are chromatin-binding factors that repress Notch signaling in the
absence of NCID by acting as CBF1 corepressors.

- Alternative ATXN1

Using coimmunoprecipitation and protein pull-down assays, Bergeron et
al. (2013) found that ALT-ATXN1 interacted directly with ATXN1. Deletion
analysis revealed that ALT-ATXN1 interacted with an N-terminal domain of
ATXN1 and not with the polyglutamine track. Neither ATXN1 nor ALT-ATXN1
directly affected expression or solubility of the other protein, and
ALT-ATXN1 translation was independent of the number of CAG repeats in
the transcript. ATXN1 spontaneously formed intranuclear inclusion in the
absence of ALT-ATXN1 and recruited ALT-ATXN1 to these inclusions.
ALT-ATXN1 also bound to poly(A) RNA.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- ATXN1 Polyglutamine Expansion in SCA1

Orr et al. (1993) demonstrated that the basic defect in spinocerebellar
ataxia-1 (164400) consists of expansion of a trinucleotide CAG repeat
(601556.0001) and Banfi et al. (1994) identified the gene as ataxin-1.
Both groups showed that the repeat is present not only in genomic DNA
but also in a 10-kb mRNA transcript.

Sisodia (1998) reviewed the significance of nuclear inclusions in
glutamine repeat disorders.

Orr and Zoghbi (2001) reviewed the history of unraveling the molecular
pathogenesis of SCA1.

- Genetic Anticipation

Chung et al. (1993) found that 63% of paternal transmissions of the
mutant allele show an increase in repeat number, whereas 69% of maternal
transmissions show no change or a decrease in repeat number. Sequence
analysis showed that 98% of unexpanded alleles had an interrupted repeat
configuration, whereas a contiguous repeat (CAG)n was found in expanded
alleles. This indicated that the repeat instability in ATXN1 is more
complex than a simple variation in repeat number and that the loss of an
interruption predisposes the ATXN1 (CAG)n to expansion. Matilla et al.
(1993) studied the expansion of the ATXN1 gene CAG repeat in a large
family in which spinocerebellar ataxia showed the phenomenon of
anticipation. There were 41 affected members with no juvenile cases of
SCA1, the mean age of onset being 36 years. The family also showed the
phenomenon of parental male bias; i.e., the age of onset was younger and
the duration of illness before death was shorter in the members of the
family who inherited the disorder from the father. In this large Spanish
kindred, Matilla et al. (1993) found 9 clinically unaffected persons
between ages 18 and 40 years who had expansions of the CAG repeat within
the pathogenetic range. In 22 other genetically 'at risk' individuals,
they found that the number of (CAG)n repeats in the ATXN1 gene was
within the normal range.

Jodice et al. (1994) found trinucleotide repeat expansion in 64 subjects
from 19 families: 57 patients with SCA1 and 7 subjects predicted, by
haplotype analysis, to carry the mutation. Comparison with a large set
of normal chromosomes showed 2 distinct distributions with a much wider
variation among expanded chromosomes. The sex of the transmitting parent
played a major role in the size distribution of expanded alleles, those
with more than 54 repeats being transmitted by affected fathers
exclusively. Alleles with 46 to 54 repeats were transmitted by affected
fathers and mothers in equal proportions. On the other hand, the sex
ratio of offspring receiving either more than 54 or less than 54 repeats
approached the expected 50:50. If a steady-state distribution of repeat
numbers is assumed to persist through the generations, this raises the
question as to why affected females transmitting alleles with more than
54 repeats are lacking, while females receiving more than 54 repeats
exist. This may be explained, at least in part, by reduced biologic
fitness. Detailed clinical follow-up of a subset of patients by Jodice
et al. (1994) demonstrated significant relationships between increasing
repeat number on expanded chromosomes and earlier age at onset, faster
progression of the disease, and earlier age at death.

- Association with Schizophrenia

Wang et al. (1996) reported evidence for linkage disequilibrium between
schizophrenia and the ATXN1 CAG repeat. The study was undertaken because
of the report by several groups of linkage between a
schizophrenia-susceptibility gene and markers on 6p (see 600511). The
authors suggested that, if the evidence of linkage disequilibrium with
the ATXN1 gene is valid, this narrows substantially the region
containing the gene, since linkage disequilibrium may be detectable over
regions much smaller than those implicated by linkage analyses. In the
second place, given the known biologic function of the ATXN1 gene in the
brain and the possible relevance of anticipation and CAG repeat
expansion in some rare cases of schizophrenia, ATXN1 may become a
promising candidate for schizophrenia.

EVOLUTION

In order to determine how the human ATXN1 gene acquired the CAG repeat
structure with interruptions, Kurosaki et al. (2006) analyzed the Atxn1
gene in many primate species, rat, and mouse. They found no repeats in
the corresponding region of rodent, prosimian, and New World monkey
Atxn1 genes. They found perfect uninterrupted CAG repeats in Old World
monkeys and interrupted CAG repeats in hominoids. Kurosaki et al. (2006)
concluded that there was no repetitive CAG structure in the common
ancestor of primates and that the interrupted repetitive structure of
the human ATXN1 gene was gradually acquired during evolution of the
simian lineage.

ANIMAL MODEL

Banfi et al. (1996) found that murine Sca1 and human ataxin-1 are highly
homologous but the CAG repeat is virtually absent in the mouse sequence,
suggesting that the polyglutamine stretch is not essential for the
normal function of ataxin-1 in mice. Cellular and developmental
expression of the murine homolog was examined using RNA in situ
hybridization. During cerebellar development, there is a transient burst
of Sca1 expression at postnatal day 14, when the murine cerebellar
cortex becomes physiologically functional. There was also marked
expression of Sca1 in mesenchymal cells of the intervertebral discs
during development of the spinal column. The results suggested to the
authors that the normal Sca1 gene has a role at specific stages of both
cerebellar and vertebral column development.

PQBP1 (300463) is a polyglutamine-binding nuclear protein which has been
shown to interact with ataxin-1. Okuda et al. (2003) generated
transgenic mice overexpressing human PQBP1. The mice showed a late-onset
and gradually progressive motor neuron disease-like phenotype suggestive
of the neurogenic muscular atrophy observed in SCA1 patients. Ataxia
could not be discriminated from predominant progressive weakness.
Pathologic examinations of the transgenic mice revealed loss of Purkinje
and granular cells in the cerebellum as well as loss of motor neurons in
the spinal anterior horn, corresponding to the pathology of human SCA1.
Okuda et al. (2003) concluded that excessive action of PQBP1 causes
neuronal dysfunction and that PQBP1 may be involved in the pathology of
SCA1.

Watase et al. (2003) investigated the pattern of CAG repeat instability
in a knockin mouse model of SCA1. Small pool (SP)-PCR analysis on DNA
from various neuronal and nonneuronal tissues revealed that somatic
repeat instability was highest in the striatum. In the 2 SCA1-vulnerable
tissues, cerebellum and spinal cord, there were substantial differences
in the profile of mosaicism. Watase et al. (2003) suggested that in SCA1
there is no clear causal relationship between the degree of somatic
instability and selective neuronal vulnerability. The finding that
somatic instability is most pronounced in the striatum of various
knockin models of polyglutamine diseases may suggest a role of
trans-acting tissue- or cell-specific factors in mediating the
instability.

Serra et al. (2004) used DNA microarrays to determine the pattern of
gene expression in SCA1 transgenic mice at 5 weeks (prior to onset of
pathology) and at 12 weeks (midpoint of disease progression). By
comparing the pattern of gene expression in the SCA1 ataxic
B05-ataxin-1(82Q) transgenic mouse line with those seen in 2 nonataxic
lines, A02-ataxin-1(30Q) and K772T(82Q), 9 genes were identified whose
expression was consistently altered in the cerebellum of B05(82Q) mice
at 5 and 12 weeks of age. Five of the genes formed a biologic cohort
centered on glutamate signaling pathways in Purkinje cells.

Using a conditional transgenic mouse model of SCA1, Serra et al. (2006)
showed that delaying postnatal expression of mutant human ATXN1 until
completion of cerebellar maturation led to a substantial reduction in
disease severity in adults compared with early postnatal expression of
mutant ATXN1. Microarray analysis revealed that genes regulated by Rora
(600825), a transcription factor critical for cerebellar development,
were downregulated at an early stage of disease in Purkinje cells of
SCA1 transgenic mice. Rora mRNA and protein levels were reduced in
Purkinje cells of SCA1 transgenic mice, and the effect of mutant ATXN1
on Rora protein levels appeared to be independent of its effect on Rora
mRNA levels. Partial loss of Rora enhanced the pathogenicity of mutant
ATXN1 in transgenic mice. Coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down analyses
suggested the existence of a complex containing Atxn1, Rora, and the
Rora coactivator Tip60 (HTATIP; 601409), with Atxn1 and Tip60
interacting directly. Serra et al. (2006) concluded that RORA and TIP60
have a role in SCA1 and proposed that their findings provide a mechanism
by which compromised cerebellar development contributes to the severity
of neurodegeneration in an adult.

Lam et al. (2006) determined that wildtype and polyglutamine-expanded
Atxn1 associate into a group of large protein complexes containing the
transcriptional repressor Capicua (CIC; 612082) in mouse cerebellum and
differentially modify CIC activity. However, although specific
interactions had been clearly implicated in neurotoxicity, it was
unclear whether the neurotoxicity of the mutant protein occurred in its
native state by association into normal endogenous protein complexes or
by the aberrant interactions and new complexes formed by the misfolding
or aggregating Atxn1.

Studies of the pathogenesis of SCA1 supported a model in which the
expanded glutamine tract in the ATXN1 gene causes toxicity by modulating
the normal activities of that gene. To explore native interactions that
modify the toxicity of ATXN1, Bowman et al. (2007) generated a targeted
duplication of mouse Ataxn1l and tested the role of this protein in SCA1
pathology. Using a knockin mouse model of SCA1 that recapitulates the
selective neurodegeneration seen in affected individuals, Bowman et al.
(2007) found that elevated Atxn1l levels suppress neuropathology by
displacing mutant Atxn1 from its native complex with Capicua. The
results provided genetic evidence that the selective neuropathology of
SCA1 arises from modulation of a core functional activity of ATXN1, and
they underscored the importance of studying the paralogs of genes
mutated in neurodegenerative diseases to gain insight into mechanisms of
pathogenesis.

Duvick et al. (2010) observed that transgenic Atxn1 mice with a wildtype
glutamine tract (30Q) and expression of a ser776-to-asp (S776D)
phosphogenic substitution developed pathologic changes in cerebellar
Purkinje cells, such as dendritic atrophy and decreased arborization of
climbing fibers, that resembled those of mice carrying only an expanded
polyglutamine tract (82Q). D776/30Q mice also showed progressive motor
dysfunction, similar to S776/82Q mice. However, the D776/30Q genotype
did not induce cell death. The study showed that a single amino acid
substitution outside of the polyQ tract converted wildtype Atxn1 into a
toxic protein with the pathogenic capabilities of the protein with an
expanded polyQ tract. Moreover, the D776 substitution enhanced the
pathogenicity of Atxn1(82Q). The results supported a model in which
disease pathogenesis involves changes in regions of the protein in
addition to the polyglutamine tract. Alteration at ser776 was critical
for neuronal dysfunction, but an expanded polyglutamine tract was
necessary for neuronal death. Duvick et al. (2010) concluded that
disease initiation and late-stage induction of neuronal death are
distinct disease phases, and suggested that inhibiting phosphorylation
may be a therapeutic strategy.

To determine the long-term effects of exercise, Fryer et al. (2011)
implemented a mild exercise regimen in a mouse model of SCA1 and found a
considerable improvement in survival accompanied by upregulation of
epidermal growth factor and consequential downregulation of Capicua,
which is an ATXN1 interactor. Offspring of Capicua mutant mice bred to
Sca1 mice showed significant improvement of all disease phenotypes.
Although polyglutamine-expanded Atxn1 caused some loss of Capicua
function, further reduction of Capicua levels--either genetically or by
exercise--mitigated the disease phenotypes by dampening the toxic gain
of function. Fryer et al. (2011) concluded that exercise might have
long-term beneficial effects in other ataxias and neurodegenerative
diseases.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 1
ATXN1, (CAG)n EXPANSION

The cause of spinocerebellar ataxia-1 (SCA1; 164400) is an expansion of
a (CAG)n repeat in the gene encoding ataxin-1 located on 6p (Orr et al.,
1993; Banfi et al., 1994). Most unexpanded alleles have an interrupted
repeat configuration, whereas a contiguous repeat (CAG)n is found in
expanded alleles. The repeat instability in ATXN1 is probably more
complex than a simple variation in repeat number; the loss of an
interruption predisposes the ATXN1 (CAG)n repeat to expansion.

Zuhlke et al. (2002) analyzed the CAG repeat length and composition in
the ATXN1 gene in 16 individuals with alleles ranging from 36 to 43
triplets. Alleles with 36 to 38 triplets were present in individuals
with ataxia but without additional characteristic features of SCA1. SCA1
phenotypes were found for patients with 41 and 43 triplets. The 39
triplet allele missing CAT interruptions was associated with symptoms
characteristic for SCA1 in 4 patients, whereas the interrupted allele
with 39 triplets did not cause characteristic SCA1 features in 1
individual. These findings suggested a change from normal to pathologic
alleles at 39 triplets depending on the presence of CAT interruptions in
the CAG repeat. Stable inheritance of the uninterrupted 39 triplet
allele was observed in 1 familial case of SCA1.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The study of patients with partial trisomy 21 has defined an area of
approximately 3 Mb at chromosomal region 21q22 as the minimal candidate
region for the Down syndrome phenotype (190685). Using a novel exon
cloning strategy, Fuentes et al. (1995) identified several putative
exons from region 21q22.1-q22.2. One exon was used to isolate fetal
brain cDNAs corresponding to the RCAN1 gene, which the authors
designated DSCR1. The predicted 171-amino acid protein contains 2
proline-rich regions, a putative DNA-binding domain, and an acidic
region. Northern blot analysis revealed that the 2.2-kb DSCR1 transcript
is expressed at the highest levels in fetal brain and adult heart and at
lower levels in various other tissues. An additional 2-kb mRNA was
detected in fetal and adult liver. Increased expression in the brains of
young rats compared with adults suggested to Fuentes et al. (1995) that
DSCR1 plays a role during central nervous system development.

By screening a human liver cDNA library and by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE
of whole human fetus, fetal brain, adult cerebellum, and adult brain,
Fuentes et al. (1997) identified splice variants of DSCR1 containing 4
alternative first exons. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of
transcripts containing exon 1 or exon 4 in a wide range of tissues, and
both transcripts were about 2.2 kb. Transcripts containing exon 1 were
expressed at highest levels in fetal brain and adult heart, brain, and
skeletal muscle. Transcripts containing exon 4 were expressed at highest
levels in fetal kidney and adult heart, skeletal muscle, and placenta.
RT-PCR detected transcripts containing exon 2 in fetal brain and liver,
but no transcripts containing exon 3 were observed.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fuentes et al. (1997) determined that RCAN1 spans nearly 45 kb and
contains 7 exons, including 4 alternative first exons. They identified
potential promoter regions upstream of exons 1, 2, and 4. The promoter
regions associated with exons 1 and 2 contain CpG islands with numerous
SP1 (189906)-binding sites, but no CAAT or TATA box elements. The
promoter region associated with exon 4 contains a possible TATA box, but
no SP1-binding sites.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids and YACs, Fuentes et al. (1995)
confirmed that the RCAN1 gene is located at chromosome 21q22.1-q22.2.
Strippoli et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Rcan1 gene to chromosome 16.

GENE FUNCTION

Fuentes et al. (2000) demonstrated that DSCR1 protein is overexpressed
in the brain of Down syndrome fetuses, and interacts physically and
functionally with calcineurin A (114105), the catalytic subunit of the
Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase PP2B. The DSCR1-binding
region in calcineurin A is located in the linker region between the
calcineurin A catalytic domain and the calcineurin B-binding domain,
outside of other functional domains previously defined in calcineurin A.
DSCR1 belongs to a family of evolutionarily conserved proteins with 3
members in humans: DSCR1, RCAN2 (604876), and RCAN3 (605860).
Overexpression of DSCR1 and RCAN2 inhibited calcineurin-dependent gene
transcription through the inhibition of NFAT (see 600489) translocation
to the nucleus. The authors hypothesized that members of this family of
human proteins are endogenous regulators of calcineurin-mediated
signaling pathways and may be involved in many physiologic processes.

In mice and humans, MCIP1 (RCAN1) is expressed primarily in cardiac and
skeletal muscles (Rothermel et al., 2000), and transcription of the
MCIP1 gene, but not of the MCIP2 (RCAN2) gene, is potently stimulated by
activated calcineurin, thereby establishing a negative feedback
mechanism that presumably serves to protect cells from otherwise
deleterious consequences of unrestrained calcineurin activity (Yang et
al., 2000). Yang et al. (2000) identified an alternative
calcineurin-responsive promoter 5-prime of exon 4 in the MCIP1 gene.

Kingsbury and Cunningham (2000) referred to the proteins encoded by the
MCIP genes as calcipressins. Functional analysis showed that when
expressed in yeast, DSCR1 and RCAN2 inhibited calcineurin function. The
authors proposed that increased expression of DSCR1 in trisomy-21
individuals may contribute to the neurologic, cardiac, or immunologic
defects of Down syndrome.

Ermak et al. (2001) showed significant expression of DSCR1 in brain,
spinal cord, kidney, liver, mammary gland, skeletal muscle, and heart.
Within the brain, DSCR1 was predominantly expressed in neurons of the
cerebral cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra, thalamus, and medulla
oblongata without regard to age in humans or rats. Postmortem studies of
8 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300) and 8 controls showed
that DSCR1 expression in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of AD
patients was approximately double that of controls, and moreover, that
DSCR1 levels in brains with extensive neurofibrillary tangles were 3
times higher than in controls. Previous studies had shown that decreased
calcineurin phosphatase activity allowed accumulation of
hyperphosphorylated tau protein and cytoskeletal changes in the brain
similar to those observed in AD (Kayyali et al., 1997). Since DSCR1
inhibits calcineurin activity, Ermak et al. (2001) suggested that
increased DSCR1 levels may cause accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau
protein and production of neurofibrillary tangles, thereby promoting the
development of AD. Cell studies showed that toxic levels of aggregated
amyloid beta 1-42 peptide directly stimulated DSCR1 expression, perhaps
as a protective mechanism against calcineurin-induced apoptosis. The
authors suggested that while DSCR1 overexpression may initially be
protective, chronic overexpression may eventually lead to the formation
of neurofibrillary tangles associated with AD.

Yao and Duh (2004) demonstrated that DSCR1 was induced in human
endothelial cells in response to VEGF (192240), TNFA (191160), and
calcium mobilization, and this upregulation was inhibited by inhibitors
of the calcineurin (see 114105)-NFAT (see 600490) signaling pathway, as
well as by PKC (see 176960) inhibition and a calcium chelator. Yao and
Duh (2004) hypothesized that upregulation of DSCR1 in endothelial cells
may act as an endogenous feedback inhibitor of angiogenesis by
regulating the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway.

Using DNA microarray analysis, Minami et al. (2004) found that treatment
of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with VEGF or thrombin
(F2; 176930) upregulated expression of DSCR1 variant-4, which contains
exons 4 through 7. DSCR1 expression was induced by VEGF and thrombin via
KDR (191306) and PAR1 (F2R; 187930), respectively, and involved
cooperative binding of NFATC and GATA2 (137295)/GATA3 (131320) to
neighboring consensus motifs in the DSCR1 internal promoter between
exons 3 and 4. Cyclosporine A, a calcineurin inhibitor, inhibited both
VEGF- and thrombin-induced DSCR1 induction. In HUVECs, VEGF induced
formation of capillary or tube-like structures, and DSCR1 overexpression
reduced tube formation. DSCR1 treatment also reduced blood vessel
density and tumor size in mice injected subcutaneously with B16 melanoma
cells. Minami et al. (2004) concluded that VEGF- and thrombin-mediated
induction of endothelial cell proliferation triggers a negative feedback
loop of DSCR1 induction leading to reduced NFAT signaling.

Arron et al. (2006) reported that 2 genes, DSCR1 and DYRK1A (600855),
that lie within the Down syndrome critical region of human chromosome 21
act synergistically to prevent nuclear occupancy of NFATc transcription
factors (see 600489), which are regulators of vertebrate development.
Arron et al. (2006) used mathematical modeling to predict that
autoregulation within the pathway accentuates the effects of trisomy of
DSCR1 and DYRK1A, leading to failure to activate NFATc target genes
under specific conditions. The authors' observations of calcineurin- and
Nfatc-deficient mice, Dscr1- and Dyrk1a-overexpressing mice, mouse
models of Down syndrome, and human trisomy 21 are consistent with these
predictions. Arron et al. (2006) suggested that the 1.5-fold increase in
dosage of DSCR1 and DYRK1A cooperatively destabilizes a regulatory
circuit, leading to reduced NFATc activity and many of the features of
Down syndrome. Arron et al. (2006) concluded that more generally, their
observations suggest that the destabilization of regulatory circuits can
underlie human disease.

To investigate the role of DSCR1 overexpression in Down syndrome and
development, Kluetzman et al. (2005) injected mouse embryos with
full-length human DSCR1, including extensive upstream and downstream
sequence. They found that DSCR1 overexpression was embryonic lethal and
proposed that other genes overrepresented in trisomy 21 may suppress the
lethality of DSCR1 overexpression.

Kim et al. (2006) stated that DSCR1 inhibits the induction of genes
involved in the inflammatory response. They found that overexpression of
the DSCR1 variant-4 attenuated phorbol ester-induced COX2 (PTGS2;
600262) upregulation in a human glioblastoma cell line. This response
was independent of calcineurin and involved stabilization
I-kappa-B-alpha (NFKBIA; 164008), an inhibitor of the transcription
factor NF-kappa-B (see 164011). Both full-length DSCR1 variant-4 and an
N-terminally truncated variant-4 decreased the steady-state activity of
NF-kappa-B as well as phorbol ester-induced activation of NF-kappa-B.

Using mouse cortical neurons, Porta et al. (2007) showed that Rcan1
increased neuronal susceptibility to oxidative stress.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human fetal brain library, Lee et al.
(2008) showed that DSCR1 interacted with NF-kappa-B-inducing kinase
(NIK, or MAP3K14; 604655). NIK phosphorylated the C-terminal region of
Dscr1 in a rat hippocampal cell line and in primary cortical neurons.
NIK-mediated phosphorylation of Dscr1 increased its protein stability
and blocked its proteasomal degradation, which led to increased levels
of soluble and insoluble Dscr1. Insoluble Dscr1 formed cytosolic
aggregates. Whereas formation of Dscr1 aggregates was not neurotoxic,
overexpression of Dscr1 without formation of aggregates led to
apoptosis.

Using microarray and RT-PCR analyses, Belmont et al. (2008) showed that
Rcan1 variant-4 was induced in mouse heart by activation of the Atf6
gene (605537), a transcription factor involved in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress response that fosters cell survival. Rcan1 was
also induced in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes following ER stress.
Overexpression of activated Atf6 in cultured cardiomyocytes induced the
Rcan1 promoter, upregulated Rcan1 mRNA, inhibited calcineurin
phosphatase activity, and inhibited cell growth. These effects were
inhibited by Rcan1-targeted small interfering RNA.

Baek et al. (2009) demonstrated that DSCR1 expression is increased in
tissue samples from Down syndrome (190685) patients and in a mouse model
of Down syndrome. Furthermore, the modest increase in expression
afforded by a single extra transgenic copy of Dscr1 in mice is
sufficient to confer significant suppression of tumor growth, and such
resistance is a consequence of a deficit in tumor angiogenesis arising
from suppression of the calcineurin pathway. Baek et al. (2009) also
provided evidence that attenuation of calcineurin activity by DSCR1,
together with another chromosome 21 gene Dyrk1a, may be sufficient to
markedly diminish angiogenesis. Baek et al. (2009) concluded that their
data provided a mechanism for the reduced cancer incidence of Down
syndrome and identified the calcineurin signaling pathway, and its
regulators DSCR1 and DYRK1A, as potential therapeutic targets in cancer
arising in all individuals.

Using an integrative genomics approach, Lee et al. (2010) identified
DSCR1 (RCAN1) as an NFAT-dependent injury-response gene in mouse smooth
muscle cells (SMC). Induction of DSCR1 inhibited calcineurin/NFAT
signaling through a negative feedback mechanism. DSCR1 overexpression
attenuated NFAT transcriptional activity and COX2 protein expression,
whereas knockdown of endogenous DSCR1 enhanced NFAT transcriptional
activity. Lee et al. (2010) concluded that DSCR1 is a novel
NFAT-dependent, injury-inducible, early gene that may serve to
negatively regulate SMC phenotypic switching.

CYTOGENETICS

Eggermann et al. (2010) reported a patient with a paternally inherited
0.46-Mb duplication of chromosome 21q22, including the KCNE1 (176261)
and RCAN1 genes, who did not have typical facial or cardiac features of
Down syndrome. The patient had a clinical phenotype resembling
Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS; 180860), which is characterized by poor
growth, but typical epigenetic changes associated with SRS were
excluded. The duplication was inherited from his unaffected father.
Eggermann et al. (2010) concluded that the RCAN1 gene is not sufficient
for generating the phenotypic features associated with Down syndrome.

ANIMAL MODEL

To investigate the involvement of MCIP1 in cardiac hypertrophy in vivo,
Vega et al. (2003) generated Mcip1-null mice and subjected them to a
variety of stress stimuli that induced cardiac hypertrophy. In the
absence of stress, Mcip1 -/- animals exhibited no overt phenotype.
However, the lack of Mcip1 exacerbated the hypertrophic response to
activated calcineurin expressed from a muscle-specific transgene,
consistent with the role of MCIP1 as the negative regulator of
calcineurin signaling. Paradoxically, however, cardiac hypertrophy in
response to pressure overload or chronic adrenergic stimulation was
blunted in Mcip1 -/- mice. These findings suggested that MCIP1 can
facilitate or suppress cardiac calcineurin signaling depending on the
nature of the hypertrophic stimulus. These opposing roles of MICP1 have
important implications for therapeutic strategies to regulate cardiac
hypertrophy through modulation of calcineurin-MCIP1 activity.

Ryeom et al. (2003) showed that Csp1-deficient mice had altered
transactivation thresholds for a number of genes triggered in an immune
response. The transactivation thresholds were shifted due to enhanced
calcineurin activity, which drove Fasl (TNFSF6; 134638) expression and
led to premature death of Th1 cells, resulting in defective Th1
responses. Ryeom et al. (2003) concluded that CSP1 acts to ensure that
high-threshold genes, such as FASL, remain silent during the primary
stimulation associated with the clonal expansion of T cells.

182465	TITLE *182465 SON DNA-BINDING PROTEIN; SON
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SON is a nuclear speckle-localized protein that shares homology with
pre-mRNA splicing accessory factors (Wynn et al., 2000).

CLONING

Berdichevskii et al. (1988) cloned a fragment designated Son3 from a
human embryonic cDNA bank. The nucleotide sequence was found to be 1,454
bp long with 6 possible open reading frames, only 1 of which did not
contain terminating codons. Translation of that open reading frame into
an amino acid sequence and database analysis showed that the Son3 region
codes for a protein with the following distinctive features: (1) the
presence of a cluster of short tandem repeats from 7 to 19 amino acids
long, located in the central part of the sequence; (2) the presence of
lengthy regions of homology with certain DNA-binding structural
proteins, such as gallin (55%), and also with oncoproteins encoded by
protooncogenes of the MYC family; and (3) the presence of a region of
homology with an oncoprotein encoded by the MOS protooncogene (190060).

Wynn et al. (2000) independently identified human SON, which shares
84.2% amino acid identity with its mouse homolog. SON has a basic
serine/arginine-rich C-terminal domain that shares homology with
proteins involved in mRNA processing. Immunofluorescence studies
localized endogenous SON to interchromatin granules of the interphase
nucleus in human epithelial cells. The nuclear speckled staining pattern
was similar to that observed with mRNA splicing factors, suggesting that
SON may play a role in mRNA processing.

GENE FUNCTION

From a human keratinocyte cDNA library, Khan et al. (1994) isolated a
clone for the DNA-binding protein SON. Using this clone, they found that
the SON gene is expressed in various cell types and that homologous
sequences can be detected in vertebrate and insect genomic DNA.

Using a combination of proteomics, cytology, and functional analysis in
C. elegans, Chu et al. (2006) reduced 1,099 proteins copurified with
spermatogenic chromatin to 132 proteins for functional analysis. This
strategy to find fertility factors conserved from C. elegans to mammals
achieved its goal: of mouse gene knockouts corresponding to nematode
proteins, 37% (7 of 19) cause male sterility. This list includes PPP1CC
(176914), H2AX (601772), SON, TOP1 (126420), DDX4 (605281), DBY
(400010), and CENPC (117141).

Karlas et al. (2010) reported the discovery of 287 human host cell genes
influencing influenza A virus replication, including SON, in a
genomewide RNA interference screen. Using an independent assay, Karlas
et al. (2010) confirmed 168 hits (59%) inhibiting either the endemic
HIN1 (119 hits) or the pandemic swine-origin (121 hits) influenza A
virus strains, with an overlap of 60%. SON was found to be important for
normal trafficking of influenza virions to late endosomes early in
infection.

GENE STRUCTURE

Slavov et al. (2000) predicted that the SON gene contains 10 exons
spanning 25 kb. Wynn et al. (2000) determined that the SON gene contains
12 exons.

MAPPING

Using PCR to amplify SON sequences from a panel of somatic cell hybrids,
Khan et al. (1994) assigned the human SON gene to chromosome 21. By use
of hybrids containing regions of chromosome 21, the localization was
refined to 21q22.1-q22.2.

Wynn et al. (2000) determined that both human and mouse SON and DONSON
(611428) are in tail-to-tail orientation and in the following order:
GART (138440)-SON-DONSON.

613114	TITLE *613114 FAMILY WITH SEQUENCE SIMILARITY 134, MEMBER B; FAM134B
;;JK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a region of chromosome 5p amplified in esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma (ESCC; see 133239) in a Chinese population, Tang et al.
(2007) identified FAM134B, which they called JK1. The deduced 39.3-kD
protein has an EGF (131530)-like domain, 3 N-glycosylation sites, 3
N-myristoylation sites, and numerous possible phosphorylation sites.

Kurth et al. (2009) stated that the human FAM134B protein contains 497
amino acids. Structure analysis showed that the N-terminal half of
FAM134B has 2 unusually long hydrophobic segments of about 35 amino
acids each that are separated by a hydrophilic loop of about 60 amino
acids. This structure is similar to that of reticulon proteins (see
600865) that shape the curvature of endoplasmic reticulum membranes. The
C terminus of FAM134B contains a coiled-coil domain. Northern blot
analysis of adult mouse tissues detected at least 4 Fam134b transcripts.
High expression of an approximately 1.5-kb transcript was detected in
testis only. Transcripts of about 3.5 kb were more weakly expressed in
dorsal root ganglia, esophagus, skeletal muscle, and kidney, and many
other tissues showed much weaker Fam134b expression. In situ
hybridization of day-14.5 mouse embryos showed prominent staining of
sensory and autonomic ganglia. In cultured mouse dorsal root ganglia,
Fam134b colocalized with a cis-Golgi marker and partly colocalized with
a trans-Golgi marker.

GENE FUNCTION

Using multiplex RT-PCR, Tang et al. (2007) found that JK1 was
overexpressed in a significant number of ESCC cell lines and tumors
compared with normal esophageal cells and tissues. Overexpression of JK1
in NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts and HEK293 cells caused an increase in
growth rate, colony formation in soft agar, and foci formation in
confluent cultures. High-grade sarcomas were formed in athymic nude mice
following subcutaneous injection of JK1-overexpressing NIH-3T3 cells.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tang et al. (2007) mapped the FAM134B gene
to chromosome 5p15.1, downstream of the delta-catenin gene (CTNND2;
604275).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 4 unrelated families with hereditary sensory and
autonomic neuropathy type IIB (HSAN2B; 613115), Kurth et al. (2009)
identified 4 different homozygous truncating loss-of-function mutations
in the FAM134B gene (613114.0001-613114.0004).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY AND AUTONOMIC, TYPE IIB
FAM134B, SER309TER

In 4 affected members of a consanguineous Saudi Arabian family with
hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 2B (613115), Kurth et
al. (2009) identified a homozygous 926C-G transversion in the FAM134B
gene, resulting in a ser309-to-ter (S309X) substitution.

.0002
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY AND AUTONOMIC, TYPE IIB
FAM134B, 2-BP DEL, 17CT

In a patient with HSAN2B (613115), Kurth et al. (2009) identified a
homozygous 2-bp deletion in exon 1 of the FAM134B gene resulting in
frameshift and premature termination at residue 133 (Pro7GlyfsTer133).

.0003
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY AND AUTONOMIC, TYPE IIB
FAM134B, GLN145TER

In 2 sibs with HSAN2B (613115), Kurth et al. (2009) identified a
homozygous mutation in the FAM134B gene resulting in a gln145-to-ter
(Q145X) substitution.

.0004
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY AND AUTONOMIC, TYPE IIB
FAM134B, IVS7DS, T-C, +2

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with HSAN2B (613115), Kurth
et al. (2009) identified a homozygous T-to-C transition in intron 7 of
the FAM134B gene (873+2T-C). The mutation results in a stop codon after
4 additional amino acids.

TASTE RECEPTOR, TYPE 2, MEMBER 44, FORMERLY; TAS2R44, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TAS2R31 belongs to the large TAS2R receptor family. TAS2Rs are expressed
on the surface of taste receptor cells and mediate the perception of
bitterness through a G protein-coupled second messenger pathway (Conte
et al., 2002). For further information on TAS2Rs, see 604791.

CLONING

By screening the human genome for sequences related to TAS2Rs, Conte et
al. (2002) cloned TAS2R44, which they called T2R53. The deduced
309-amino acid protein contains the 7-transmembrane structure and short
N- and C-terminal domains conserved in TAS2Rs. The intracellular domains
share significant conservation with other TAS2R family members. TAS2R44
shares highest sequence similarity with TAS2R43 (612668).

By in situ hybridization, Kuhn et al. (2004) confirmed the presence of
TAS2R44 on human circumvallate papilla.

GENE FUNCTION

Using human embryonic kidney cells transfected with an experimental
construct that coupled activation of TAS2R43 or TAS2R44 to measurable
Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores, Kuhn et al. (2004) showed that
both receptors responded to a subset of bitter-tasting compounds. Both
receptors were activated by the sulfonyl amide sweeteners, saccharine
and acesulfame K, although TAS2R43 showed a weaker response. Both
receptors were highly sensitive to aristolochic acid, a purely
bitter-tasting compound, and neither was activated by compounds
eliciting sweet or umami taste. Consistent with the in vitro data,
cross-adaptation studies in human subjects supported the existence of
common receptors for both sulfonyl amide sweeteners. Kuhn et al. (2004)
concluded that TAS2R43 and TAS2R44 could contribute to the bitter
aftertaste of saccharine and acesulfame K.

Deshpande et al. (2010) found that bitter taste receptor agonists evoked
increased intracellular calcium in cultured human airway smooth muscle
(ASM) cells at levels comparable to GPCR agonists, such as bradykinin
and histamine. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis detected multiple TAS2R
transcripts in ASM cells, with highest expression of TAS2R10 (604791),
TAS2R14 (604790), and TAS2R31, intermediate expression of TAS2R5
(605062), TAS2R4 (604869), and TAS2R19 (613961), and detectable
expression of 11 other TAS2Rs, with results normalized for expression of
ADRB2 (109690). Expression of 8 other TAS2Rs and TAS1R1 (606225) and
TAS1R2 (606226) was undetectable. Using isolated intact mouse airways,
Deshpande et al. (2010) observed dose-dependent relaxation in response
to bitter taste receptor agonists, such as chloroquine, denatorium, and
quinine, after challenge with contracting agents, such as acetylcholine
or serotonin. Magnet twisting cytometry showed that isolated ASM cells
challenged with histamine relaxed after treatment with bitter taste
receptor agonists. Bitter taste receptor agonists were a more effective
treatment than albuterol in a mouse model of allergic airway
inflammation. Deshpande et al. (2010) proposed that agents that bind
bitter taste receptors and cause bronchodilation may provide an
alternative and/or supplement to beta agonist for the treatment of
asthma.

Brockhoff et al. (2010) found that exchanging 2 residues within
C-terminal transmembrane domain-7 of the related human taste receptors
TAS2R46 (612774), which is activated by strychnine, and TAS2R31, which
is activated by aristolochic acid, was sufficient to invert their
agonist selectivity. Transfer of functionally relevant amino acids in
TAS2R46 to the corresponding positions of TAS2R43 and TAS2R31 resulted
in pharmacologic properties indistinguishable from parental TAS2R46.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and genomic sequence analysis, Conte et al.
(2002) mapped the TAS2R31 gene to a 1.2-Mb TAS2R gene cluster on
chromosome 12p.

601290	TITLE *601290 STRATIFIN; SFN
;;14-3-3-SIGMA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SFN, or 14-3-3-sigma, is a regulator of mitotic translation that
interacts with a variety of translation and initiation factors (Wilker
et al., 2007).

CLONING

Leffers et al. (1993) obtained peptide sequence and subsequently cloned
a T-cell cDNA of the 14-3-3 family (see 113508) of conserved proteins.
The protein, called stratifin, was shown to be diffusely distributed in
the cytoplasm and was present in cultured epithelial cells. It was most
abundant in tissues enriched in stratified keratinizing epithelium.

MAPPING

Hermeking et al. (1997) mapped the SFN gene to chromosome 1p35 using
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Through a quantitative analysis of gene expression patterns in
colorectal cancer cell lines, Hermeking et al. (1997) discovered that
14-3-3-sigma, or stratifin, is strongly induced by gamma irradiation and
other DNA-damaging agents. The induction of 14-3-3-sigma is mediated by
a p53 (191170)-responsive element located 1.8 kb upstream of its
transcription start site. Exogenous introduction of 14-3-3-sigma into
cycling cells results in a G2 arrest. As the fission yeast 14-3-3
homologs rad24 and rad25 mediate similar checkpoint effects, Hermeking
et al. (1997) concluded that the results document a molecular mechanism
for G2/M control that is conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution and
regulated in human cells by p53.

Chan et al. (1999) described an improved approach to the generation of
human somatic cell knockouts, which they used to generate human
colorectal cancer cells in which both 14-3-3-sigma alleles were
inactivated. After DNA damage, these cells initially arrested in the G2
phase of the cell cycle, but unlike cells containing 14-3-3-sigma, the
14-3-3-sigma -/- cells were unable to maintain cell cycle arrest. The
14-3-3-sigma -/- cells died (mitotic catastrophe) as they entered
mitosis. This process was associated with a failure of the
14-3-3-sigma-deficient cells to sequester the proteins (cyclin B,
123836; CDC2, 116940) that initiate mitosis and prevent them from
entering the nucleus. Chan et al. (1999) concluded that these results
indicated a mechanism for maintaining the G2 checkpoint and preventing
mitotic death.

Expression of 14-3-3-sigma is induced in response to DNA damage, and
causes cells to arrest in G2. By SAGE, Ferguson et al. (2000) identified
sigma as a gene whose expression is 7-fold lower in breast carcinoma
cells than in normal breast epithelium. Although genetic alterations at
the SFN locus such as loss of heterozygosity were rare and no mutations
were detected, the authors found that hypermethylation of CpG islands in
the SFN gene could be detected in 91% of breast tumors and was
associated with lack of gene expression. Treatment of
sigma-nonexpressing breast cancer cell lines with the drug
5-aza-2-prime-deoxycytidine resulted in demethylation of the gene and
synthesis of sigma mRNA. Breast cancer cells lacking sigma expression
showed an increased number of chromosomal breaks and gaps when exposed
to gamma-irradiation. Ferguson et al. (2000) thought it possible that
loss of sigma expression contributes to malignant transformation by
impairing the G2 cell cycle checkpoint function, thus allowing an
accumulation of genetic defects. They suggested that hypermethylation
and loss of sigma expression were the most consistent molecular
alterations identified in breast cancer.

Urano et al. (2002) demonstrated that EFP (600453) is a
RING-finger-dependent ubiquitin ligase (E3) that targets proteolysis of
14-3-3-sigma, a negative cell cycle regulator that causes G2 arrest.
Urano et al. (2002) demonstrated that tumor growth of breast cancer MCF7
cells implanted in female athymic mice is reduced by treatment with
antisense Efp oligonucleotide. Efp-overexpressing MCF7 cells in
ovariectomized athymic mice generated tumors in the absence of estrogen.
Loss of Efp function in mouse embryonic fibroblasts resulted in an
accumulation of 14-3-3-sigma, which was responsible for reduced cell
growth. Urano et al. (2002) concluded that their data provide an insight
into the cell cycle machinery and tumorigenesis of breast cancer by
identifying 14-3-3-sigma as a target for proteolysis by EFP, leading to
cell proliferation.

Wilker et al. (2007) reported a previously unknown function for
14-3-3-sigma as a regulator of mitotic translation through its direct
mitosis-specific binding to a variety of translation/initiation factors,
including eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (EIF4B; 603928) in a
stoichiometric manner. Cells lacking 14-3-3-sigma, in marked contrast to
normal cells, cannot suppress cap-dependent translation and do not
stimulate cap-independent translation during and immediately after
mitosis. This defective switch in the mechanism of translation results
in reduced mitotic-specific expression of the endogenous internal
ribosomal entry site (IRES)-dependent form of the cyclin-dependent
kinase CDK11 (p58 PITSLRE; 176873), leading to impaired cytokinesis,
loss of Polo-like kinase-1 (602098) at the midbody, and the accumulation
of binucleate cells. The aberrant mitotic phenotype of
14-3-3-sigma-depleted cells can be rescued by forced expression of CDK11
or by extinguishing cap-dependent translation and increasing
cap-independent translation during mitosis by using rapamycin. Wilker et
al. (2007) concluded that their findings showed how aberrant mitotic
translation in the absence of 14-3-3-sigma impairs mitotic exit to
generate binucleate cells and provides a potential explanation of how
14-3-3-sigma-deficient cells may progress on the path to aneuploidy and
tumorigenesis.

A large proportion of aggressive squamous cell carcinomas in humans and
mice express markedly reduced IKKA (CHUK; 600664), and somatic mutations
in IKKA have been identified in human squamous cell carcinomas. Zhu et
al. (2007) identified 14-3-3-sigma as a downstream target of Ikka in
cell cycle regulation in response to DNA damage and found that the
14-3-3-sigma locus was hypermethylated in Ikka -/- mouse keratinocytes,
but not in wildtype keratinocytes. Trimethylated histone H3-lys9 (see
602810) associated with Suv39h1 (300254) and Dnmt3a (602769) in the
methylated 14-3-3-sigma locus. Reintroduction of Ikka restored
14-3-3-sigma expression by associating with H3 and preventing access of
Suv39h1 to H3, thereby preventing hypermethylation of 14-3-3-sigma. Zhu
et al. (2007) concluded that IKKA protects the 14-3-3-sigma locus from
hypermethylation, which serves as a mechanism of maintaining genomic
stability in keratinocytes.

Choi et al. (2011) showed that the ubiquitin ligase COP1 (RFWD2; 608067)
targeted 14-3-3-sigma for ubiquitin-mediated degradation in human cell
lines. The COP9 signalosome subunit COPS6 (614729) stabilized COP1 by
reducing COP1 autoubiquitination, resulting in elevated 14-3-3-sigma
ubiquitination and degradation.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

The 14-3-3 family of proteins mediates signal transduction by binding to
phosphoserine-containing proteins. Using phosphoserine-oriented peptide
libraries to probe all mammalian and yeast 14-3-3s, Yaffe et al. (1997)
identified 2 different binding motifs, RSXpSXP and RXY/FXpSXP, present
in nearly all known 14-3-3 binding proteins. The crystal structure of
YWHAZ (601288) complexed with the phosphoserine motif in polyoma
middle-T was determined to 2.6-angstrom resolution. The authors showed
that the 14-3-3 dimer binds tightly to single molecules containing
tandem repeats of phosphoserine motifs, implicating bidentate
association as a signaling mechanism with molecules such as Raf, BAD
(603167), and Cbl.

ANIMAL MODEL

Stratifin is highly expressed in differentiating epidermis and mediates
cell cycle arrest. To extend understanding of skin development, Herron
et al. (2005) set out to identify the causal mutation in 'repeated
epilation' (Er) mutant mice. The heterozygous mutant (Er/+) mouse was
originally identified in the offspring of a male exposed to gamma
radiation; the mutant had a disheveled appearance at 3 weeks of age.
Older heterozygous mice had an increased incidence of papillomas and
squamous cell carcinomas. Linkage studies localized the Er gene to mouse
chromosome 4 in an 820-kb region containing 22 genes. Among these genes,
Sfn was considered a good candidate for underlying the Er mutation
because it has a role in keratinocyte differentiation and because Sfn
expression is abnormal in epithelial cancers. Sequencing of the Sfn open
reading frame in genomic DNA from homozygous Er/Er and wildtype mice
detected a single T insertion at basepair 622 in homozygous mutant mice.
This frameshift mutation at amino acid 207 truncates the C terminus of
the protein encoded by the Er allele, eliminating residues required for
ligand interaction and the nuclear export sequence.

By gene expression analysis of skin and embryonic fibroblasts from
wildtype and Er mice, Li et al. (2005) identified a 1-bp insertion
(642insT) in the Sfn gene that results in the Er phenotype. The
insertion causes a frameshift leading to a truncated protein lacking 40
amino acids at the C terminus. Li et al. (2005) noted that Er/+ adult
mice showed repeated hair loss, whereas Er/Er mutant mice died at birth
due to respiratory distress and skin defects, with hyperplastic
epidermis, failure of keratinocyte differentiation, and abnormal
craniofacial development. Ectopic overexpression of Sfn in Er/Er
keratinocytes rescued the defects of keratinocyte differentiation.

609928	TITLE *609928 MYOSIN, HEAVY CHAIN 7B, CARDIAC MUSCLE, BETA; MYH7B
;;MYOSIN HEAVY CHAIN 14; MYH14;;
KIAA1512
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned MYH7B, which they designated
KIAA1512. The deduced 1,692-amino acid protein shares 71% identity with
MYH7 (160760). RT-PCR ELISA detected high MYH7B expression in heart,
skeletal muscle, testis, adult and fetal brain, and all specific adult
brain regions examined. Slightly lower expression was detected in ovary
and kidney, and intermediate expression was detected in lung, pancreas,
spleen, and adult and fetal liver.

By screening genomic cosmid libraries for myosin heavy chain genes,
followed by cDNA hybridization and PCR amplification, Desjardins et al.
(2002) cloned MYH7B, which they called MYH14. The deduced protein
contains several class II myosin consensus sequences and has a tail
region of about 1,100 amino acids with homology to both class II myosins
and dimerization domains of leucine zipper proteins. In its N-terminal
catalytic domain, MYH14 has novel surface loop sequences, including
substitutions in the aliphatic sequence of loop 1 and paired prolines in
loop 2. Desjardins et al. (2002) compared the motor domain of MYH14 with
those of other MYHs and concluded that MYH14 is a slow-twitch myosin.
Database analysis identified MYH14 ESTs in libraries obtained from whole
embryo, pooled human tissue cDNA, and well-differentiated endometrial
adenocarcinoma.

By scanning mouse myosin genes for intronic microRNAs (miRNAs), van
Rooij et al. (2009) identified Mir499 (613614) within intron 19 of the
Myh7b gene. Northern blot analysis showed that Mir499 and Myh7b were
highly expressed in mouse heart and the slow-twitch soleus muscle, but
not in the fast-twitch gastrocnemius/plantaris, tibialis anterior, and
extensor digitorum longus muscles.

GENE STRUCTURE

Desjardins et al. (2002) determined that the MYH7B gene contains at
least 40 coding exons and spans about 24 kb.

Van Rooij et al. (2009) identified an miRNA, Mir499 (613614), within
intron 19 of the mouse Myh7b gene.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the MYH7B gene
to chromosome 20. Desjardins et al. (2002) confirmed this localization
by genomic sequence analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Van Rooij et al. (2009) found that expression of Myh7b and its
intronically encoded miRNA, Mir499, was upregulated in mouse heart by
hypothyroidism caused by inhibition of triiodothyronine (T3; see 188450)
synthesis. This upregulation was reversed by T3 administration. Gain-
and loss-of-function experiments in mice showed that expression of Myh7b
and Mir499 was controlled by the dominant miRNA in mouse heart, Mir208a
(611116).

603420	TITLE *603420 CALUMENIN; CALU
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Many calcium-binding proteins are reported to be localized in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and involved in such ER functions as protein
folding and sorting. Among these are RCN1 (602735), RCN2 (602584), and
calumenin (CALU), which form a novel family of calcium-binding proteins
in the ER and Golgi apparatus. By searching sequence databases with a
mouse Calu cDNA sequence (Yabe et al., 1997), Yabe et al. (1998)
identified a human CALU EST, which they used to clone a full-length CALU
cDNA. The cDNA encodes a deduced 315-amino acid protein containing 6
EF-hand motifs, 1 potential N-glycosylation site, and a C-terminal ER
retention signal. The human and mouse CALU proteins are 98% identical.
Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the 3.4-kb CALU mRNA is
ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. Southern blot analysis using a
human CALU cDNA probe detected bands in a variety of species.

MAPPING

Yabe et al. (1997) mapped the mouse Calu gene to the proximal portion of
chromosome 7. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Yabe et al. (1998)
localized the human CALU gene to 7q32, which was an unexpected result
due to the homology of synteny between proximal mouse chromosome 7 and
human 19q13.2-q13.3.

606091	TITLE *606091 SIALIC ACID-BINDING IMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE LECTIN 10; SIGLEC10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SIGLECs are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily that are expressed
on the cell surface. Most SIGLECs have 1 or more cytoplasmic immune
receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, or ITIMs. SIGLECs are
typically expressed on cells of the innate immune system, with the
exception of the B-cell expressed SIGLEC6 (604405).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences resembling CD33 (SIGLEC3;
159590) and screening a spleen cDNA library, Munday et al. (2001)
isolated a cDNA encoding SIGLEC10. Sequence analysis predicted that the
697-amino acid SIGLEC10 protein contains a signal peptide, an N-terminal
V-set Ig-like domain and 4 C2-set Ig-like domains, 5 potential N-linked
glycosylation sites, a transmembrane region, and a 126-residue
cytoplasmic tail with 3 putative ITIMs. Northern blot analysis detected
a major 3.0-kb SIGLEC10 transcript, with highest levels in spleen, lymph
node, blood leukocytes, and appendix. Little or no expression was
observed in pancreas, thyroid, and testis. Flow cytometric analysis
demonstrated eosinophil-specific expression of SIGLEC10, but at a lower
level than that of SIGLEC8 (605639). Expression was also detected on
monocytes and a CD16 (146740)-positive/CD56-negative natural killer-like
lymphocyte population. After sialidase treatment, which is necessary for
unmasking the sialic acid-binding site on SIGLECs interacting with cell
surface sialic acids, cells expressing SIGLEC10 bound to red blood
cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated expression of a 100- to
120-kD monomeric protein, higher than the predicted molecular mass,
suggesting that SIGLEC10 is glycosylated.

By random sequencing and by comparison with known SIGLEC sequences, Li
et al. (2001) independently cloned SIGLEC10 from a dendritic cell cDNA
library. The cDNA predicted a deduced 607-amino acid protein containing
3 C2-set domains and 3 putative N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot
analysis of multiple human tissues revealed a transcript of about 3.3 kb
in peripheral blood lymphocytes, ovary, and spleen, and a transcript of
about 1.8 kb in liver, spleen, thymus, and lung.

Using the positional candidate cloning approach, Yousef et al. (2001)
identified SIGLEC10 and found that it encodes 3 variants: a deduced
protein of 697 amino acids, a shorter variant missing exon 8, and a
variant with multiple combined exons including intronic sequences.
RT-PCR detected expression of SIGLEC10 primarily in bone marrow, spleen,
brain, small intestine, colon, and spinal cord.

GENE FUNCTION

With use of SIGLEC10-transfected COS-7 cells, Li et al. (2001) found
moderate red blood cell binding and rosette formation that was augmented
by sialidase pretreatment to eliminate sialylated (cis ligands) on the
COS-7 cell surface. With use of polyacrylamide glycoconjugates, they
determined that SIGLEC10 preferentially bound glycoconjugates carrying
sialic acid in either alpha-2,3 or alpha-2,6 linkages, similar to the
binding observed for SIGLEC5 (604200).

Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger (cell
injury)-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) both trigger activation of
the innate immune system. Chen et al. (2009) reported that Cd24
(600074)-deficient mice exhibit increased susceptibility to DAMPs but
not PAMPs. CD24 associates with high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1;
163905), heat shock protein-70 (HSP70; 140550), and heat shock
protein-90 (HSP90; 140571). CD24 negatively regulates their stimulatory
activity and inhibits nuclear factor kappa-B (see 164011) activation.
Chen et al. (2009) reported that this occurs at least in part through
CD24 association with SIGLEC10 in humans or SiglecG in mice. Chen et al.
(2009) concluded that the CD24-SiglecG pathway protects the host against
a lethal response to pathologic cell death and discriminates danger-
versus pathogen-associated molecular patterns.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yousef et al. (2001) determined that the SIGLEC10 gene contains 11 exons
and spans about 6.5 kb.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Munday et al. (2001) mapped the SIGLEC10 gene to 19q13.3,
where it is closely linked to other CD33-related SIGLECs. Yousef et al.
(2001) identified the SIGLEC10 gene on overlapping BAC clones localized
to chromosome 19q13.4. SIGLEC10 lies 278 kb telomeric to SIGLEC9
(605640) and 35 kb centromeric to SIGLEC8.

610303	TITLE *610303 V-MAF AVIAN MUSCULOAPONEUROTIC FIBROSARCOMA ONCOGENE HOMOLOG A; MAFA
;;RIPE3B1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MAFA is a transcription factor that binds RIPE3b, a conserved enhancer
element that regulates pancreatic beta cell-specific expression of the
insulin gene (INS; 176730) (Olbrot et al., 2002).

CLONING

By searching a genomic database for sequences similar to hamster Mafa,
followed by PCR of genomic DNA, Olbrot et al. (2002) cloned human MAFA.
The deduced 352-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal activation
domain rich in serine, proline, and threonine, followed by 2
glycine-rich regions separated by a histidine-rich region, and a
C-terminal DNA-binding and dimerization domain containing a basic
leucine zipper. Northern blot analysis detected Mafa in mouse and
hamster insulinoma cells, in mouse thymus, and in mouse embryos at
embryonic day 14, and there was evidence of alternative splicing. No
expression was detected in other mouse tissues examined or in a
glucagon-producing cell line.

GENE FUNCTION

Using EMSA, Olbrot et al. (2002) found that full-length and N-terminally
truncated MAFA bound a RIPE3b probe, and it appeared to bind as a
homodimer. Following transfection in HeLa cells, only the full-length
protein activated insulin gene expression from the RIPE3b element,
although the N-terminally truncated form localized to the nucleus.

Expression of MAFA, as well as PDX1 (600733) and BETA2 (NEUROD1;
601724), 2 other transcription factors that bind enhancer elements in
the insulin gene, is enriched in beta cells. Following their
transfection into non-beta cell lines, Zhao et al. (2005) found that
rodent Pdx1 and Beta2 showed little or no activation of a reporter
construct driven by the insulin promoter in the absence of Mafa. Mafa
together with Pdx1 or Beta2 produced synergistic activation, and insulin
promoter activity was even higher when all 3 proteins were present.
Stimulation was attenuated upon compromising either Mafa transactivation
or DNA-binding activity. Coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro pull-down
assays showed that Mafa directly bound endogenous rodent Pdx1 and Beta2.
Dominant-negative and small interfering RNAs of Mafa profoundly reduced
insulin promoter activity in rodent beta cell lines. Mafa was induced in
parallel with insulin mRNA in glucose-stimulated rat islets, and insulin
mRNA levels were elevated in rat islets by adenovirus-mediated Mafa
expression. Zhao et al. (2005) concluded that MAFA plays a key role in
coordinating and controlling the level of insulin gene expression in
islet beta cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Olbrot et al. (2002) determined that the coding region of the MAFA gene
is intronless.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Olbrot et al. (2002) mapped the MAFA gene
to chromosome 8q24.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhang et al. (2005) found that Mafa-null mice were born at the expected
frequency and survived until adulthood. Mafa-null mice displayed
intolerance to glucose and developed diabetes mellitus. Glucose-,
arginine-, or KCl-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic beta
cells was severely impaired, although insulin content per se was not
significantly affected. Mafa-null mice also showed age-dependent
pancreatic islet abnormalities. Molecular analysis revealed that Ins1,
Ins2, Pdx1, Beta2, and Glut2 (SLC2A2; 138160) transcripts were
diminished in Mafa-deficient mice.

Zhou et al. (2008) used a strategy of reexpressing key developmental
regulators in vivo to identify a specific combination of 3 transcription
factors, Neurog3 (604882), Pdx1 (600733), and Mafa, that reprogrammed
differentiated pancreatic exocrine cells in adult mice into cells that
closely resembled beta cells. Induced beta cells were indistinguishable
from endogenous islet beta cells in size, shape, and ultrastructure.
They expressed genes essential for beta cell function and could
ameliorate hyperglycemia by remodeling local vasculature and secreting
insulin. Zhou et al. (2008) concluded that their study provided an
example of cellular reprogramming using defined factors in an adult
organ and suggested a general paradigm for directing cell reprogramming
without reversion to a pluripotent stem cell state.

162096	TITLE *162096 MIDKINE; MDK
;;MIDGESTATION AND KIDNEY; MK;;
NEURITE GROWTH-PROMOTING FACTOR 2, FORMERLY; NEGF2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Midkine is a retinoic acid-responsive, heparin-binding growth factor
expressed in various cell types during embryogenesis. It promotes
angiogenesis, cell growth, and cell migration. Midkine is also expressed
in several carcinomas, suggesting that it may play a role in
tumorigenesis, perhaps through its effects on angiogenesis (summary by
Reynolds et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using mouse Mk to screen a midgestation human embryonic kidney cDNA
library, followed by screening a placenta genomic library, Tsutsui et
al. (1991) cloned human MDK, which they called MK. The deduced 121-amino
acid protein has a signal sequence and shares 87% identity with mouse
Mk. Orthologs of MK were detected in rat, cow, and chicken. The chicken
ortholog, Rihb, is a retinoic acid-induced heparin-binding protein. MK
shares about 50% amino acid homology with the human heparin-binding
protein pleiotrophin (PTN; 162095), with highest conservation in the
central part of the molecule and complete conservation of cysteine
residues. Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of about 1 kb in
adult human kidney and PA1 human teratocarcinoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Reynolds et al. (2004) found that hypoxia induced midkine expression in
alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary vasculature in a strain of mice
sensitive to hypoxia. Hypoxia induced expression of both HIF1-alpha
(603348) and midkine in human placental adenocarcinoma, mouse fetal lung
mesenchyme, and human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell lines. HIF1-alpha
induced midkine expression via regulatory elements in the mouse midkine
promoter. Chronic expression of midkine during embryonic development in
transgenic mice resulted in pulmonary arterial remodeling and
muscularization, but only during the postnatal phase of lung
development. In fetal mouse lung mesenchymal cells and transgenic mice,
midkine upregulated expression of myocardin (MYOCD; 606127), a regulator
of smooth muscle cell differentiation.

Intraperitoneal adhesions between organs or between organs and
peritoneal walls occur in more than 90% of cases involving major
abdominal operations. Using a model of postoperative adhesions and
Mk-null mice, Inoh et al. (2004) showed that midkine was fundamentally
involved in the formation of intraperitoneal adhesions, at least partly
by promoting migration of macrophages and neutrophils to the omentum.

Hobo et al. (2009) found that 5/6 nephrectomy in mice, a model of
chronic kidney disease, induced expression of midkine in lung, leading
to elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; 106180) activity and
plasma angiotensin II (106150) levels and subsequent hypertension.
Exposure to midkine enhanced ACE expression in primary cultured human
lung microvascular endothelial cells. Oxidative stress may have
contributed to midkine expression, since 5/6 nephrectomy induced
expression of NADH/NADPH oxidase-1 (NOX1; 300225), Nox2 (CYBB; 300481),
and Nox4 (605261). Furthermore, an antioxidant reduced midkine
expression and plasma angiotensin II levels and ameliorated hypertension
in 5/6 nephrectomized mice.

GENE STRUCTURE

Uehara et al. (1992) determined that the MDK gene contains 4 exons. The
5-prime flanking region adjacent to the start site contains 5 GC boxes,
a steroid/thyroid hormone receptor-binding site, and an A/T-rich island,
but there is no obvious CAAT box. Further upstream there is a region
with high GC content. The mouse Mdk gene has a similar organization,
with conservation of exons and significant homology in the 5-prime
region adjacent to the start site. There are 3 additional regions of
homology between mouse and human MDK in the 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, Eddy et al. (1991) demonstrated that
the MDK gene segregates concordantly with chromosome 11 and, using cell
hybrids carrying translocations involving chromosome 11, they mapped the
gene regionally to 11p13-p11. Kaname et al. (1993) mapped the MDK gene
to human chromosome 11p11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Simon-Chazottes et al. (1992) mapped the mouse Mdk gene to chromosome 2,
using an interspecific backcross panel and microsatellite polymorphisms
as markers. O'Hara et al. (1995) used somatic cell hybrid analysis and
interspecific backcross analysis, respectively, to map human Mdk to
chromosome 11p13-p11 and mouse Mdk to a syntenic region of mouse
chromosome 2. They also mapped an Mdk pseudogene to mouse chromosome 11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using microarray analysis, Ezquerra et al. (2005) found that aortae of
Mk -/- mice showed elevated expression of renin (REN; 179820),
angiotensinogen (106150), angiotensin II receptor-1 (AGTR1; 106165), and
angiotensin II receptor-2 (AGTR2; 300034) and decreased expression of
Ace.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned ANKRD12, which they designated
KIAA0874. The deduced protein contains 601 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected moderate expression in brain, kidney, heart, lung, liver,
testis, and ovary. Low expression was detected in skeletal muscle,
pancreas, and spleen.

Using the p19(Arf) isoform of mouse Cdkn2a (600160) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cDNA library, Tompkins
et al. (2006) cloned Ankrd12. The deduced protein contains an ankyrin
repeat. Tompkins et al. (2006) referred to Ankrd12 as Anco1.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an in vitro binding assay, Tompkins et al. (2006) confirmed
binding between mouse p19(Arf) and Ankrd12.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the ANKRD12
gene to chromosome 18.

610284	TITLE *610284 LIPOYLTRANSFERASE 1; LIPT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In mammals, lipoyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.181) catalyzes the second of 2
steps in the covalent attachment of lipoic acid to lipoate-dependent
proteins, including the glycine cleavage system H protein (GCSH; 238330)
and the dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2) subunits of the pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex (DLAT; 608770), the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
complex (DLST; 126063), and the branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase
complex (DBT; 248610) (Fujiwara et al., 1999).

CLONING

Using a bovine lipoyltransferase cDNA fragment as probe, Fujiwara et al.
(1999) cloned human LIPT1 from a liver cDNA library. The deduced
373-amino acid precursor protein shares 88% and 31% sequence identity
with bovine lipoyltransferase II and E. coli lipoate-protein ligase A,
respectively. By alignment of LIPT1 with the bovine lipoyltransferase
amino acid sequence, Fujiwara et al. (1999) predicted that the
N-terminal 26 amino acids comprise a mitochondrial targeting sequence,
with the threonine-27 corresponding to the first residue of the mature
enzyme. Thus, the deduced mature LIPT1 enzyme contains 347 amino acids
with a calculated molecular mass of 39.539 kD. Northern blot analysis
detected a major 1.5-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in skeletal muscle and heart, followed by liver, brain,
placenta, and lung.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fujiwara et al. (1999) determined that the LIPT1 gene contains 4 exons
and spans 8 kb of genomic DNA. They found evidence of several LIPT1
transcripts resulting from alternative splicing in the 5-prime
untranslated region.

MAPPING

By FISH, Fujiwara et al. (1999) mapped the LIPT1 gene to chromosome
2q11.2.

602649	TITLE *602649 COLD-INDUCIBLE RNA-BINDING PROTEIN; CIRBP
;;CIRP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cold stress induces in microorganisms the synthesis of several proteins
that are involved in various cellular processes such as transcription,
translation, and recombination. The cold-inducible RNA-binding protein
(Cirp) is induced in rodent cells by mild cold stress (32 degrees C).
Cirp consists of an N-terminal RNA-binding domain and a C-terminal
gly-rich domain, and plays an essential role in cold-induced suppression
of cell proliferation. Nishiyama et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA encoding an
18-kD protein with 95.3% amino acid sequence identity to the mouse Cirp
protein. CIRBP mRNA was constitutively expressed in all cell lines
examined. In all of the cell lines, the levels of CIRBP mRNA and protein
were increased within 12 hours after a temperature downshift from 37
degrees C to 32 degrees C. These results demonstrated that CIRBP is a
cold-shock protein in human cells.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Nishiyama et al. (1997) mapped
the CIRBP gene to chromosome 19p13.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Morf et al. (2012) showed that simulated body temperature cycles, but
not peripheral oscillators, controlled the rhythmic expression of
cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP) in cultured fibroblasts. In
turn, loss-of-function experiments indicated that CIRBP was required for
high-amplitude circadian gene expression. The transcriptomewide
identification of CIRBP-bound RNAs by a biotin-streptavidin-based
crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) procedure revealed several
transcripts encoding circadian oscillator proteins, including CLOCK
(601851). Moreover, CLOCK accumulation was strongly reduced in
CIRBP-depleted fibroblasts. Because ectopic expression of CLOCK improved
circadian gene expression in these cells, Morf et al. (2012) concluded
that CIRBP confers robustness to circadian oscillators through
regulation of CLOCK expression.

KIAA1880. The BTBD9 transcript has an MIR repetitive element in its
5-prime UTR. The deduced 642-amino acid protein contains a BTB/POZ
domain. RT-PCR detected high expression of BTBD9 in kidney and moderate
expression in all other adult and fetal tissues and specific brain
regions examined.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the BTBD9 gene
to chromosome 6.

606090	TITLE *606090 CARNITINE OCTANOYLTRANSFERASE; CROT
;;COT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Carnitine octanoyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.137) is a carnitine
acyltransferase that catalyzes the reversible transfer of fatty acyl
groups between CoA and carnitine. This provides a crucial step in the
transport of medium- and long-chain acyl-CoA out of the mammalian
peroxisome to the cytosol and mitochondria. See also CRAT (600184).

Van der Leij et al. (2000) reviewed the function, structural features,
and phylogenetics of human carnitine acyltransferase genes, including
CROT.

CLONING

By screening an EST database with rat and bovine CROT sequences,
Ferdinandusse et al. (1999) identified human CROT EST sequences. Using
RT-PCR with human skin fibroblast RNA, they cloned a CROT cDNA encoding
a 612-amino acid, 66-kD protein containing a putative C-terminal
peroxisomal targeting signal type 1. CROT shares 85% sequence identity
with both the bovine and rat CROT proteins.

Using enzyme activity measurements of CROT expressed in a carnitine
acetyltransferase-deficient yeast strain, Ferdinandusse et al. (1999)
demonstrated that CROT efficiently converts a branched-chain fatty
acyl-CoA (4,8-dimethylnonanoyl-CoA) to its corresponding carnitine
ester. They hypothesized that CROT plays a crucial role in the
beta-oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids including pristanic acid.

GENE STRUCTURE

Van der Leij et al. (2000) determined that the CROT gene contains 18
exons spanning 54 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

Using database analysis, van der Leij et al. (2000) identified the CROT
sequence on a chromosome 7q21.1 YAC contig.

610398	TITLE *610398 SAP30-LIKE PROTEIN; SAP30L
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display analysis to search for genes upregulated by
TGFB1 (190180) in differentiating intestinal epithelial cells, followed
by screening a human heart cDNA library, Lindfors et al. (2003) cloned
SAP30L. The deduced 183-amino acid protein contains 2 potential
N-glycosylation sites, 1 N-myristoylation site, and several
phosphorylation sites. Transient transfection studies showed that SAP30L
localized to the nucleus in small dense bodies that are not PML bodies.
Mutation of the SAP30L nuclear localization signal caused the protein to
also be expressed throughout the cytoplasm. SAP30L shares 70% identity
with SAP30 (603378) and 97% identity with mouse Sap30l. Northern blot
detected a 1.30-kb transcript in all human tissues examined, with
highest expression in testis, followed by heart, kidney, and placenta. A
6.5-kb transcript had high expression in brain and lung.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lindfors et al. (2003) determined that the SAP30L gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lindfors et al. (2003) mapped the SAP30L
gene to chromosome 5q33.2.

607824	TITLE *607824 HOOK, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 2; HOOK2
;;HK2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Hook proteins are cytosolic coiled-coil proteins that contain conserved
N-terminal domains, which attach to microtubules, and more divergent
C-terminal domains, which mediate binding to organelles. The Drosophila
Hook protein is a component of the endocytic compartment (summary by
Walenta et al., 2001).

CLONING

Using homology with the Drosophila Hook gene, Kramer and Phistry (1999)
identified ESTs containing the HOOK2 sequence, which they called HK2. By
5-prime RACE of a placenta cDNA library, they cloned a full-length HOOK2
cDNA. The deduced 728-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal domain,
a central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal domain. HOOK2 shares 30%
identity with Drosophila Hook, with highest conservation in the
N-terminal domain. Kramer and Phistry (1999) also identified a shorter,
alternatively spliced transcript.

By Western blot analysis, Walenta et al. (2001) determined that
endogenous HOOK2 detected in HEK293 cells had an apparent molecular mass
of about 83 kD. Endogenous HOOK2 localized to discrete punctate
subcellular structures that were often observed in linear tracks that
colocalized with microtubule markers.

GENE FUNCTION

By Western blot analysis of HEK293 immunoprecipitates, Walenta et al.
(2001) determined that HOOK2 exists in a protein complex that is
distinct from complexes containing HOOK1 (607820) and HOOK3 (607825). By
microtubule spin-down assay, they determined that full-length HOOK2 and
a C-terminal truncation mutant bound to microtubules.

601263	TITLE *601263 MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE KINASE 2; MAP2K2
;;PROTEIN KINASE, MITOGEN-ACTIVATED, KINASE 2; PRKMK2;;
MKK2; MAPKK2;;
MAPK/ERK KINASE 2; MEK2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zheng and Guan (1993) isolated and sequenced 2 human cDNAs encoding
members of the MAP kinase kinase (MAP2K) family, designated MEK1
(176872) and MEK2 by them. The MEK2 cDNA encodes a predicted 400-amino
acid protein that shares 80% sequence identity with human MEK1.

Brott et al. (1993) cloned the mouse Mek2 gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Zheng and Guan (1993) showed that recombinant MEK2 and MEK1 both could
activate human ERK1 (601795) in vitro. They further characterized
biochemically the 2 MAP2Ks.

A virulence factor from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, YopJ, is a 33-kD
protein that perturbs a multiplicity of signaling pathways. These
include inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK,
c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathways and inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa B
(NF-kappa-B; see 164011) pathway. The expression of YopJ has been
correlated with the induction of apoptosis by Yersinia. Using a yeast
2-hybrid screen based on a LexA-YopJ fusion protein and a HeLa cDNA
library, Orth et al. (1999) identified mammalian binding partners of
YopJ. These included the fusion proteins of the GAL4 activation domain
with MAPK kinases MKK1 (176872), MKK2, and MKK4/SEK1 (601335). YopJ was
found to bind directly to MKKs in vitro, including MKK1, MKK3 (602315),
MKK4, and MKK5 (602448). Binding of YopJ to the MKK blocked both
phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the MKKs. These results
explain the diverse activities of YopJ in inhibiting the ERK, JNK, p38,
and NF-kappa-B signaling pathways, preventing cytokine synthesis and
promoting apoptosis. YopJ-related proteins that are found in a number of
bacterial pathogens of animals and plants may function to block MKKs so
that host signaling responses can be modulated upon infection.

Mittal et al. (2006) found that the Yersinia YopJ virulence factor
inhibited the host inflammatory response and induced apoptosis of immune
cells by catalyzing acetylation of 2 ser residues in the activation loop
of MEK2, thereby blocking MEK2 activation and signal propagation. YopJ
also caused acetylation of a thr residue in the activation loop of both
IKKA (CHUK; 600664) and IKKB (IKBKB; 603258). Mittal et al. (2006)
concluded that ser/thr acetylation is a mode of action for bacterial
toxins that may also occur under nonpathogenic conditions to regulate
protein function.

Influenza A viruses are significant causes of morbidity and mortality
worldwide. Annually updated vaccines may prevent disease, and antivirals
are effective treatment early in disease when symptoms are often
nonspecific. Viral replication is supported by intracellular signaling
events. Using U0126, a nontoxic inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2, and thus an
inhibitor of the RAF1 (164760)/MEK/ERK pathway (see Favata et al.
(1998)), Pleschka et al. (2001) examined the cellular response to
infection with influenza A. U0126 suppressed both the early and late ERK
activation phases after virus infection. Inhibition of the signaling
pathway occurred without impairing the synthesis of viral RNA or
protein, or the import of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNP) into
the nucleus. Instead, U0126 inhibited RAF/MEK/ERK signaling and the
export of viral RNP without affecting the cellular mRNA export pathway.
Pleschka et al. (2001) proposed that ERK regulates a cellular factor
involved in the viral nuclear export protein function. They suggested
that local application of MEK inhibitors may have only minor toxic
effects on the host while inhibiting viral replication without giving
rise to drug-resistant virus variants.

Scholl et al. (2007) found that conditional deletion of either Mek1 or
Mek2 in mouse skin had no effect on epidermal development, but combined
Mek1/Mek2 deletion during embryonic development or in adulthood
abolished Erk1/Erk2 (MAPK1; 176948) phosphorylation and led to
hypoproliferation, apoptosis, skin barrier defects, and death.
Conversely, a single copy of either allele was sufficient for normal
development. Combined Mek1/Mek2 loss also abolished Raf-induced
hyperproliferation. To examine the effect of combined MEK deletion on
human skin, Scholl et al. (2007) used small interfering RNA to delete
MEK1 and MEK2 expression in normal primary human keratinocytes and used
these cells to regenerate human epidermal tissue on human dermis, which
was grafted onto immune-deficient mice. Control keratinocytes or those
lacking either MEK1 or MEK2 were able to regenerate 6 days after
grafting. In contrast, combined depletion of MEK1 and MEK2 led to either
graft failure or markedly hypoplastic epidermis that nonetheless
contained an intact stratum corneum. ERK2 expression rescued the defect.
Scholl et al. (2007) concluded that MEK1 and MEK2 are functionally
redundant in the epidermis and function in a linear relay in the MAPK
pathway.

MAPPING

Brott et al. (1993) mapped the mouse Mek2 gene to chromosome 10.

Puttagunta et al., (2000) constructed a cosmid/BAC map of human
chromosome 19p13.3 and localized over 50 genes, including MAP2K2, to the
contig. The 19p13.3 region shows syntenic homology with mouse chromosome
10.

Meloche et al. (2000) had erroneously mapped the MAP2K2 gene to 7q32.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome

In 23 patients with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC4; 615280),
Rodriguez-Viciana et al. (2006) searched for mutations in downstream
effectors of RAS and found a missense mutation in MEK2 in 1 patient
(F57C; 601263.0001). The F57 codon of MEK2 is equivalent to codon F53 of
MEK1, which was mutated in another CFC patient (176872.0001).

In 3 (5.9%) of 51 CFC patients, Schulz et al. (2008) identified 2
different mutations in the MAP2K2 gene (F57V; 601263.0002 and Y134H;
601263.0003).

Rauen et al. (2010) and Linden and Price (2011) independently reported 2
unrelated families with autosomal dominant transmission of CFC due to
heterozygous mutations in the MAP2K2 gene (P128Q, 601263.0004 and G132D,
601263.0005, respectively).

- Somatic Mutations

Nikolaev et al. (2012) performed exome sequencing to detect somatic
mutations in protein-coding regions in 7 melanoma cell lines and
donor-matched germline cells. All melanoma samples had high numbers of
somatic mutations, which showed the hallmark of UV-induced DNA repair.
Such a hallmark was absent in tumor sample-specific mutations in 2
metastases derived from the same individual. Two melanomas with
noncanonical BRAF mutations harbored gain-of-function MAP2K1 (MEK1;
176872) and MAP2K2 mutations, resulting in constitutive ERK
phosphorylation and higher resistance to MEK inhibitors. Screening a
larger cohort of individuals with melanoma revealed the presence of
recurring somatic MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 mutations, which occurred at an
overall frequency of 8%.

ANIMAL MODEL

Belanger et al. (2003) developed Mek2-deficient mice. Mutant mice were
viable and fertile and showed no phenotypic abnormalities. Mutant
embryonic fibroblasts and purified lymphocytes proliferated normally,
demonstrating that Mek2 is not required for reentry into the cell cycle
or for T-cell development. Belanger et al. (2003) concluded that MEK1
can compensate for a lack of MEK2 function.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CARDIOFACIOCUTANEOUS SYNDROME 4
MAP2K2, PHE57CYS

In a patient with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC4; 615280),
Rodriguez-Viciana et al. (2006) identified a T-to-G transversion at
nucleotide 170 of the MEK2 gene, resulting in a
phenylalanine-to-cysteine substitution at codon 57 (F57C).

By in vitro studies, Senawong et al. (2008) found that MEK1 mutants F53S
(176872.0001) and Y130C (176872.0002) and the MEK2 mutant F57C could not
induce ERK signaling unless phosphorylated by RAF at 2 homologous serine
residues in the regulatory loop. When these serine residues were
replaced with alanines, ERK phosphorylation was significantly reduced in
the presence of RAF. However, the F57C MEK2 mutant was less dependent on
RAF signaling than the other mutants. This difference resulted in F57C
MEK2 being resistant to the selective RAF inhibitor SB-590885. However,
all 3 mutants were sensitive to the MEK inhibitor U0126. Senawong et al.
(2008) suggested that MEK inhibition could have potential therapeutic
value in CFC.

.0002
CARDIOFACIOCUTANEOUS SYNDROME 4
MAP2K2, PHE57VAL

In 2 patients with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC4; 615280), Schulz
et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous de novo 169T-G transversion in
exon 2 of the MAP2K2 gene, resulting in a phe57-to-val (F57V)
substitution. This same codon is affected in F57C (601263.0001). Both
patients had a unique facial phenotype with a long narrow face, tall
forehead, low-set ears, severe ptosis, epicanthal folds, and prominent
supraorbital ridges.

.0003
CARDIOFACIOCUTANEOUS SYNDROME 4
MAP2K2, TYR134HIS

In a patient with CFC (CFC4; 615280), Schulz et al. (2008) identified a
heterozygous 400T-C transition in exon 3 of the MAP2K2 gene, resulting
in a tyr134-to-his (Y134H) substitution.

.0004
CARDIOFACIOCUTANEOUS SYNDROME 4
MAP2K2, PRO128GLN

In affected members of a 4-generation Caucasian Cajun family with CFC
(CFC4; 615280), Rauen et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 383C-A
transversion in exon 3 of the MAP2K2 gene, resulting in a pro128-to-gln
(P128Q) substitution. In vitro functional expression studies showed that
the mutant protein had increased kinase activity, but not as much as
other CFC-associated MAP2K2 mutations (e.g., F57C; 601263.0001), and was
considered a weak hypermorphic mutation. This was the first reported
case of vertical transmission of a MAP2K2 mutation in CFC. The phenotype
was variable, and included the classic craniofacial features, pulmonic
stenosis, ectodermal abnormalities, and variable degrees of learning
delays and disabilities. One of the mutation carriers died of acute
lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) at age 41 years, which the authors postulated
may have resulted from increased activity of the RAS pathway.

.0005
CARDIOFACIOCUTANEOUS SYNDROME 4
MAP2K2, GLY132ASP

In a mother and her 2 sons with CFC4 (615280), Linden and Price (2011)
identified a heterozygous 395G-A transition in exon 3 of the MAP2K2
gene, resulting in a gly132-to-asp (G132D) substitution in a conserved
residue. The proband was a 46-year-old man with mildly delayed
development, pulmonary stenosis as a child, myopia, short stature,
tightly curled short hair, absent eyebrows, hyperelastic skin, and
multiple lentigines. His 40-year-old brother and 68-year-old mother had
similar features. Linden and Price (2011) emphasized the rarity of
autosomal dominant transmission of CFC, and noted that the mild
cognitive phenotype in these patients suggests greater reproductive
success.

601337	TITLE *601337 REGULATORY FACTOR X, 3; RFX3
DESCRIPTION The RFX1 gene product (600006) is a transactivator of the human
hepatitis B viral enhancer I. Reith et al. (1994) commented that the RFX
family members (in particular RFX1 and RFX3) constitute the nuclear
complexes referred to previously as enhancer factor C (EF-C), EP, and
methylation-dependent DNA-binding protein (MDBP), or rpL30-alpha. They
identified and cloned 3 members of this gene family from both human and
mouse using lambda gt11 cDNA libraries. Reith et al. (1994) found that
the gene for RFX3 encodes a 707-amino acid polypeptide. Homology between
the 3 RFX proteins is restricted largely to 5 conserved regions,
including the 2 domains required for DNA binding and dimerization. RFX1,
RFX2 (142765), and RFX3 all have similar DNA-binding specificities. The
RFX monomers can heterodimerize both in vivo and in vitro but all 3 are
capable of binding DNA as monomers. They showed that the RFX3 transcript
is expressed in many mouse tissues, with highest expression in the
brain, intestine, and testis but low expression in the seminal vesicle.

DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

Kwiatkowski et al. (1991) identified highly informative dinucleotide
repeat polymorphisms in the TCTE1 locus, previously called D6S46.
Linkage mapping positioned this marker midway between the centromere and
HLA with recombination fractions as follows:
D6Z1--0.21--TCTE1--0.24--HLA. Two-color fluorescence in situ
hybridization placed TCTE1 proximal to D6S19, which in turn is proximal
to D6S29 and HLA.

612733	TITLE *612733 THO COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 5; THOC5
;;FMS-INTERACTING PROTEIN; FMIP;;
PK1.3;;
FSAP79
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In yeast, the TREX (transcription/export) complex contains the THO
transcription elongation complex, which functions in cotranscriptional
recruitment of mRNA export proteins to the nascent transcript. The human
TREX complex contains ALY (THOC4; 604171), UAP56 (DDX39B; 142560), and
the human counterpart of the THO complex, which includes THOC5. The
human TREX complex appears to be recruited to spliced mRNAs late in the
splicing reaction rather than by direct cotranscriptional recruitment,
as in yeast (Masuda et al., 2005).

CLONING

Using exon amplification to identify genes in a region of chromosome 22
associated with meningioma (607174), followed by screening a fetal brain
cDNA library, Xie et al. (1993) cloned THOC5, which they called PK1.3.
The deduced 683-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
78.5 kD. Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript in all tissues examined, with highest expression in skeletal
muscle, followed by heart and pancreas. A 10-kb transcript was also
detected in brain, placenta, and skeletal muscle.

Tamura et al. (1999) cloned mouse Thoc5, which they called Fmip. Mouse
and human THOC5 share 95.6% amino acid identity. Both contain a central
WW domain-binding motif, followed by an acidic region with 3 potential
phosphorylation sites, and a leucine zipper with 4 heptad repeats. They
also have 2 clusters of basic residues that may act as nuclear
localization signals. Northern blot analysis detected Thoc5 in all mouse
tissues examined, with highest expression in testis, liver, and heart.
Among human fetal tissues, THOC5 was highly expressed in kidney and
liver, with lower expression in lung and brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis and in vitro protein interaction assays,
Tamura et al. (1999) showed that the N-terminal domain of mouse and
human FMIP interacted with the cytoplasmic domain of activated FMS
(CSF1R; 164770), a tyrosine kinase that functions as a receptor for
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF, or CSF1; 120420). Binding
induced rapid FMS-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of FMIP within its
FMS-binding domain, which was followed by dissociation of the 2
molecules. FMIP did not interact with other receptor tyrosine kinases
examined. MCSF treatment induced a bipotential mouse myeloid progenitor
cell line to differentiate into macrophages, but MCSF stimulation in the
presence of overexpressed FMIP induced the same cells to differentiate
into granulocytes. Tamura et al. (1999) concluded that the level of FMIP
determines the differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells into either
macrophages or granulocytes.

Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis of HeLa cell
nuclear extracts, Masuda et al. (2005) found that the human TREX complex
contained THO2 (THOC2; 300395), FSAP79 (THOC5), HPR1 (THOC1; 606930),
UAP56, TEX1 (THOC3; 606929), FSAP35 (THOC6; 615403), ALY, and FSAP24
(THOC7; 611965). Immunodepletion and gel-filtration analyses revealed
that THO2, HPR1, FSAP79, FSAP35, and FSAP24 were tightly associated in
the THO complex, whereas UAP56, ALY, and TEX1 were more loosely
associated. Immunoprecipitation of any TREX component efficiently
immunoprecipitated spliced mRNA and cDNA transcripts, but not unspliced
pre-mRNAs. Immunodepletion of any component had no effect on spliceosome
assembly, splicing, or RNA stability. The TREX complex assembled on
every mRNA examined. Mutation analysis showed that the C terminus of ALY
was required for binding of both UAP56 and the THO complex. The C
terminus of UAP56 was sufficient for ALY binding. The N terminus of
UAP56 interacted weakly with the THO complex and TEX1, suggesting that
other regions of UAP56 are required for maximal binding. Masuda et al.
(2005) concluded that recruitment of the human TREX complex is not
directly coupled to transcription, as in yeast.

Pierce et al. (2008) showed that expression of the human oncogenic
fusion protein TEL (ETV6; 600618)/PDGFRB (173410) in murine myeloid
FDCP-Mix cells increased the expression and phosphorylation of Thoc5.
Inhibition of TEL/PDGFRB with imatinib partially reversed Thoc5
upregulation. Elevated Thoc5 expression led to increased levels of
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdInsP3), suggesting that the
elevated PtdInsP3 levels observed with TEL/PDGFRB expression were due,
at least in part, to Thoc5 upregulation. Thoc5 upregulation also
decreased apoptosis, whereas knockdown of Thoc5 via small interfering
RNA led to rapid cell death. TEL/PDGFRB and several other leukemogenic
tyrosine kinases phosphorylated Thoc5 on tyr225.

Carney et al. (2009) showed that MCSF-stimulated maturation of a mouse
myelogenous leukemia cell line was associated with enhanced Thoc5
expression and phosphorylation. Thoc5 also formed a complex with
Cebp-beta (CEBPB; 189965). Ectopic expression of human THOC5 mimicked
MCSF-mediated cell maturation and enhanced the expression of several
myeloid transcription factors, including CEBP-beta. Increased THOC5
expression also mimicked the MCSF-stimulated increase in PtdInsP3.
Inhibition of the THOC5-induced increase in PtdInsP3 abrogated the
effects of elevated Cebp-beta. Carney et al. (2009) concluded that THOC5
stabilizes transcription factors to potentiate monocytic cell line
development.

GENE STRUCTURE

Xie et al. (1993) estimated that the THOC5 gene spans 100 to 150 kb.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and analysis of a YAC and cosmid contig,
Xie et al. (1993) mapped the THOC5 gene to chromosome 22q12, adjacent
and centromeric to the NF2 gene (607379).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using Thoc5-knockout mice, Pierce et al. (2008) showed that Thoc5 was
required to maintain hematopoietic cells in vivo.

609666	TITLE *609666 TWO-PORE SEGMENT CHANNEL 1; TPCN1
;;TWO-PORE CHANNEL 1; TPC1;;
KIAA1169
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Voltage-gated Ca(2+) and Na+ channels have 4 homologous domains, each
containing 6 transmembrane segments, S1 to S6. TPCN1 is similar to these
channels, but it has only 2 domains containing S1 to S6 (Ishibashi et
al., 2000).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Hirosawa et al. (1999) cloned TPCN1, which they designated
KIAA1169. The deduced 775-amino acid protein, which may be N-terminally
truncated, contains motifs associated with ion transport proteins.
RT-PCR ELISA detected robust expression in all adult and fetal tissues
and specific brain regions examined. Highest expression was in heart and
kidney, and lowest expression was in spleen.

Ishibashi et al. (2000) cloned rat Tpcn1, which they called Tpc1. The
deduced 819-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 94.6
kD. It contains 2 homologous domains, each of which has 6 transmembrane
segments (S1 to S6) and a putative pore loop between S5 and S6. Northern
blot analysis detected a 5-kb transcript expressed at highest levels in
rat kidney, followed by liver, lung, and spleen. In rat kidney, Tpc1 was
expressed at the apical membrane of medullary collecting ducts. By EST
database analysis, Ishibashi et al. (2000) identified likely human and
plant orthologs of Tpc1.

GENE FUNCTION

Calcraft et al. (2009) showed that 2-pore channels (TPCs) comprise a
family of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP)
receptors, with human TPC1 and chicken TPC3 being expressed on endosomal
membranes, and human TPC2 on lysosomal membranes when expressed in
HEK293 cells. Membranes enriched with TPC2 show high affinity NAADP
binding, and TPC2 underpins NAADP-induced Ca(2+) release from
lysosome-related stores that is subsequently amplified by Ca(2+)-induced
Ca(2+) release by inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs).
Responses to NAADP were abolished by disrupting the lysosomal proton
gradient and by ablating TPC2 expression, but were only attenuated by
depleting endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores or by blocking InsP3Rs.
Thus, TPCs form NAADP receptors that release Ca(2+) from acidic
organelles, which can trigger further Ca(2+) signals via
sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum. Calcraft et al. (2009) concluded
that TPCs provide insights into the regulation and organization of
Ca(2+) signals in animal cells.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TPCN1
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP D12S1195E).

605650	TITLE *605650 POLYMERASE, DNA, KAPPA; POLK
;;DINB1;;
POLQ
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

External and internal DNA-damaging agents continually threaten the
integrity of genetic material in cells. Although a variety of repair
mechanisms exist to remove the resulting lesions, some lesions escape
repair and block the replication machinery. Members of the Y family of
DNA polymerases, such as POLK, permit the continuity of the replication
fork by allowing replication through such DNA lesions. Each Y family
polymerase has a unique DNA-damage bypass and fidelity profile. POLK is
specialized for the extension step of lesion bypass (summary by Lone et
al., 2007).

CLONING

The E. coli DinB protein, which is homologous to the S. cerevisiae Rev1
and Rad30 (POLH; 603968) proteins and the E. coli UmuC protein, is
involved in DNA damage-induced mutagenesis. By PCR of mouse fibroblast
cDNA with degenerate primers based on the E. coli DinB sequence,
followed by screening of a HeLa cell cDNA library with the mouse probe,
Gerlach et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA encoding POLK, which they termed
DINB1. The deduced 870-amino acid POLK protein contains an N-terminal
conserved nucleotidyl transferase domain, 2 tandem helix-hairpin-helix
domains implicated in DNA binding, and a nonconserved C terminus
containing 2 zinc clusters. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous
expression of a 5.0-kb transcript at low but varying levels in all
tissues tested. Highest expression was found in testis, which also had
abundant 3.2- and 4.4-kb transcripts.

By EST database searching and screening of a human testis cDNA library,
Ogi et al. (1999) independently isolated a POLK cDNA.

By EST database searching for homologs of yeast Rad30 and screening of a
fetal brain cDNA library, Johnson et al. (2000) also cloned POLK, which
they termed POL-theta (POLQ) because it encodes the eighth known
eukaryotic polymerase.

GENE FUNCTION

Ogi et al. (1999) showed that transient expression of mouse Dinb1 cDNA
in cultured cells subjected to 6-thioguanine selection resulted in a
10-fold increase in the incidence of point mutations, 30% of which were
frameshift mutations.

Using functional analysis, Johnson et al. (2000) showed that purified
POLK can incorporate all 4 nucleotides almost to the end of the
template. In contrast to POLH, POLK, which lacks a proofreading
exonuclease function, is unable to bypass DNA lesions, namely cis-syn
T-T dimers, T-T photoproducts, or an abasic site. Assays of fidelity of
replication indicated that POLK misincorporated deoxynucleotides with a
frequency of 1/1000 to 1/10,000, a rate 10-fold lower than that of POLH.

Ohashi et al. (2000) also found that POLK is unable to bypass T-T
dimers. Unlike Johnson et al. (2000), however, they did observe
bypassing of abasic sites, the most common lesions in DNA within cells
which are generated by spontaneous hydrolysis of the N glycoside bond
during the course of repairing base-damage generated by carcinogenic
agents and ionizing radiation. Ohashi et al. (2000) noted that their
finding was heavily dependent on sequence context and enzyme
concentration.

In order to understand how DNA mismatching impacts the DNA-binding step,
the nucleotide-binding step, and the nucleotide-incorporation step,
Carlson et al. (2006) performed pre-steady-state kinetic studies with an
active recombinant N-terminal fragment of human POLK. When DNA contained
matched primer-terminal basepairs, they found that most of the POLK-DNA
complexes were nonproductive and that the concentration of active POLK
was low; however, when POLK was bound to DNA with mismatched
primer-terminal basepairs, they found that nonproductive complexes were
not formed and that the concentration of active POLK was high. Carlson
et al. (2006) concluded that POLK evolved to specifically function on
DNA substrates with aberrant primer-terminal basepairs.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Ohashi et al. (2009) showed that the
C-terminal domain of REV1 (REV1L; 606134) interacted with POLK, and they
identified 2 consecutive phenylalanines in POLK that were required for
the interaction. A POLK mutant lacking REV1-binding activity did not
complement the genotoxic sensitivity of Polk -/- mouse embryonic
fibroblasts, demonstrating that interaction with REV1 is essential for
POLK function in vivo.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Lone et al. (2007) stated that POLK has a Y family polymerase
architecture with palm, fingers, and thumb domains in the shape of the
right hand and a polymerase-associated domain (PAD) or 'little finger.'
They presented the crystal structure of the POLK catalytic core (amino
acids 19 to 526) bound to a template-primer and an incoming nucleotide.
POLK almost completely encircles the DNA and has a constrained active
site cleft that can accommodate only a single Watson-Crick basepair.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, Gerlach et al. (1999)
mapped the POLK gene to chromosome 5q13.1.
