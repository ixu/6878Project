DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CSF2RB gene encodes the high-affinity beta subunit of a receptor for
interleukin-5 (IL5R; 147851), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (CSF2R; 306250)
(Tavernier et al., 1991), and interleukin-3 (IL3RA; 308385) (Kitamura et
al., 1991).

See also the low-affinity alpha subunit of the receptor (CSF2RA; 306250)

CLONING

Hayashida et al. (1990) isolated cDNA clones corresponding to the beta
subunit of the GMCSF receptor from a human erythroleukemia cDNA library.
The deduced 897-amino acid protein had a molecular mass of approximately
120 kD and shares 56% sequence identity with the mouse AIC2B protein.

In the mouse, 2 distinct but related genes, AIC2A (Csf2rb2) and AIC2B
(Csf2rb1), encode the beta subunit common to Csf2r, Il5r, and Il3r
(Gorman et al., 1992). Hara and Miyajima (1992) stated that the mouse
AIC2B gene encodes a common beta subunit for the mouse Gmcsf and Il5
receptors, whereas AIC2A encodes a low-affinity Il3-binding protein by
itself. Hara and Miyajima (1992) found that AIC2A formed a high-affinity
Il3-binding protein when coexpressed with a mouse protein homologous to
the human alpha subunit. In addition, AIC2B formed a high-affinity
Il3-binding protein when coexpressed with the alpha subunit. Thus, the
mouse has 2 high-affinity Il3 receptors, but only the AIC2B gene encodes
a common beta subunit for the mouse Gmcsf, Il5, and Il3 receptors. Robb
et al. (1995) referred to the mouse AIC2B gene as 'beta-c' (for common)
and the AIC2A gene as 'beta-Il3.'

MAPPING

Shen et al. (1992) mapped the human CSF2RB gene to chromosome 22 by PCR
analysis of a series of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization to normal human chromosomes and 2
translocations involving chromosome 22 as well as the chromosome
expressing the rare fragile site FRA22A, they regionalized the gene to
22q12.2-q13.1, proximal to the fragile site.

Gorman et al. (1992) demonstrated that the 2 mouse genes, provisionally
designated Il3rb1 and Il3rb2, are located in the same 250-kb restriction
fragment and map to chromosome 5, closely linked to the Sis locus
(PDGFB; 190040).

GENE FUNCTION

Tavernier et al. (1991) stated that the common receptor subunit, CSF2RB,
that is shared between IL5R and CSF2R provides a molecular basis for the
observation that IL5 (147850) and CSF2 (138960) can partially interfere
with each other's binding and have highly overlapping biologic
activities on eosinophils.

D'Andrea et al. (1994) isolated a mutant form of the IL5RB gene from
growth factor-independent cells that arose spontaneously after infection
of a murine factor-dependent hematopoietic cell line with a retroviral
expression construct of the common beta chain gene. The mutation
consisted of a 37-amino acid duplication of extracellular sequence that
included 2 conserved sequence motifs and conferred ligand-independent
growth on the cells. The results suggested that members of the large
family of cytokine receptors have the capacity to become oncogenically
active.

Jenkins et al. (1995) reported the identification of 2 activating point
mutations in the CSF2RB gene that were generated using a PCR-based
random mutagenesis procedure. By combining this procedure with a
retroviral expression cloning system, they isolated these mutants by
virtue of their ability to confer factor independence on a
factor-dependent hematopoietic cell line. The ability of point mutations
to activate the gene supported the possibility that such mutations could
contribute to human leukemia. In addition, the nature and properties of
these mutants had important implications for the mechanisms of signaling
by the 3 receptors that utilize the common beta subunit. One mutation,
val449-to-glu, was located within the transmembrane domain and, by
analogy with a similar mutation in the NEU oncogene (164870), might act
by inducing dimerization of the common beta subunit. The other mutation,
ile374-to-asn, lay in the extracellular, membrane-proximal portion of
the common beta molecule.

Dirksen et al. (1998) described expression defects of the CSF2RB and/or
the CSF2RA genes in 3 pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Leukemic cells from all 3
patients failed to express express normal levels of beta-c. In addition,
leukemic cells from 2 of the patients lacked expression of CSF2RA, as
shown by flow cytometry. Strikingly reduced or absent function of beta-c
was demonstrated in clonogenic progenitor assays with absent
colony-forming unit growth after GMCSF or IL3 stimulation. The response
to growth factors acting via a growth factor receptor distinct from the
GMCSF/IL3/IL5 system was normal. After antileukemic treatment, the
pulmonary symptoms resolved and beta-c or beta-c plus CSF2RA expression
was normal. Dirksen et al. (1998) concluded that a defect in the CSF2RB
and/or CSF2RA on AML blasts can be associated with respiratory failure
in patients with AML.

Kondo et al. (2000) showed that a clonogenic common lymphoid progenitor,
a bone marrow-resident cell that gives rise exclusively to lymphocytes
(T, B, and natural killer cells), can be redirected to the myeloid
lineage by stimulation through exogenously expressed interleukin-2
receptor (146710) and GMCSF receptor. Analysis of mutants of the beta
chain of the IL2 receptor revealed that the granulocyte and monocyte
differentiation signals are triggered by different cytoplasmic domains,
showing that the signaling pathways responsible for these unique
developmental outcomes are separable. Finally, Kondo et al. (2000)
showed that the endogenous myelomonocytic cytokine receptors for GMCSF
and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1R; 164770) are expressed
at low to moderate levels on the more primitive hematopoietic stem
cells, are absent on common lymphoid progenitors, and are upregulated
after myeloid lineage induction by IL2 (147680). Kondo et al. (2000)
concluded that cytokine signaling can regulate cell fate decisions and
proposed that a critical step in lymphoid commitment is downregulation
of cytokine receptors that drive myeloid cell development.

Using yeast 2-hybrid, protein pull-down, and coimmunoprecipitation
assays, Kao et al. (2008) showed that CBAP (TMEM102; 613936) interacted
with the box-2 motif of beta-c. Removal of GMCSF increased the amount of
beta-c and CBAP that immunoprecipitated from TF1 erythroleukemia cells
and that colocalized in intracellular compartments. Overexpression of
CBAP in IL3 (147740)-dependent Ba/F3 pro-B cells increased the
percentage of cells showing mitochondrial changes characteristic of
apoptosis and enhanced the apoptotic effect of GMCSF deprivation.
Conversely, knockdown of CBAP in TF1 cells reduced cell sensitivity to
GMCSF deprivation, but not to other proapoptotic stimuli. Kao et al.
(2008) concluded that CBAP binds the isolated beta-c molecule and has a
role in GMCSF deprivation-induced apoptosis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Freeburn et al. (1996) failed to find pathogenic mutations in the CSF2RB
gene in 35 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Although different
patterns were detected in 25 (71%) AML patients and 8 (80%) of 10
healthy controls, all nucleotide changes were found to be polymorphisms.
The authors concluded that the CSF2RB is highly polymorphic, but point
mutations do not appear to contribute to the pathogenesis of AML.

Dirksen et al. (1997) described an expression defect of the CSF2RB gene
in 4 of 7 pediatric patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (see
614370). The patients failed to express normal levels of beta-c, as
shown by flow cytometry. Reduced or absent function of beta-c was
demonstrated by ligand binding studies and progenitor clonogenic assays.
Although molecular analysis of 1 patient identified what the authors
referred to as a pro602-to-thr (P602T) mutation, this change was shown
by Freeburn et al. (1996) to be a polymorphism (P603T with revised
sequence).

In a Japanese woman with adult-onset pulmonary surfactant metabolism
dysfunction-5 (SMDP5; 614370), manifest as pulmonary alveolar
proteinosis, Tanaka et al. (2011) identified a homozygous truncating
mutation in the CSF2RB gene (138981.0001). Each unaffected parent was
heterozygous for the mutation. Tanaka et al. (2011) speculated that the
late onset in this patient may have been due to compensatory factors
such as increased serum GMCSF acting through an intact CSF2RA subunit
(306250) or increased levels of other inflammatory cells.

ANIMAL MODEL

Robb et al. (1995) used gene targeting to create mice with a null
mutation of the common beta subunit of the Csf2rb1 gene (AIC2B). In the
homozygous mice, high-affinity binding of GMCSF (138960) was abolished,
while cells from heterozygous animals showed an intermediate number of
high-affinity receptors. Binding of IL3 (147740) was unaffected,
confirming that the IL3-specific beta-chain remained intact. Homozygous
animals showed reduced eosinophil numbers in peripheral blood and bone
marrow, while other hematologic parameters were normal. In clonal
cultures of homozygous null bone marrow cells, even high concentrations
of GMCSF and IL5 failed to stimulate colony formation, but the cells
exhibited normal quantitative responsiveness to stimulation by IL3 and
other growth factors. The mice exhibited normal development and survived
to young adult life, although they developed pulmonary
peribronchovascular lymphoid infiltrates and areas resembling alveolar
proteinosis. There was no detectable difference in the systemic
clearance and distribution of GMCSF.

D'Andrea et al. (1998) produced transgenic mice expressing a spontaneous
mutation in the murine Csf2rb1 gene that confers growth
factor-independent proliferation on primary committed myeloid
progenitors. All transgenic mice displayed a myeloproliferative disorder
characterized by splenomegaly, erythrocytosis, and granulocytic and
megakaryocytic hyperplasia. This disorder resembled the human disease
polycythemia vera (263300), suggesting that activating mutations in the
CSF2RB gene may play a role in the pathogenesis of that
myeloproliferative disorder. In addition, the transgenic mice developed
a sporadic, progressive neurologic disorder and displayed bilateral,
symmetrical foci of necrosis in the white matter of the brainstem
associated with an accumulation of macrophages. D'Andrea et al. (1998)
concluded that chronic CSF2RB activation also has the potential to
contribute to pathologic events in the central nervous system.

CSF2RB, 1-BP DEL, 631C

In a Japanese woman with adult-onset pulmonary surfactant metabolism
dysfunction-5 (SMDP5; 614370), manifest as pulmonary alveolar
proteinosis and respiratory insufficiency, Tanaka et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (631delC) in exon 6 of the CSF2RB
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. Each
unaffected parent was heterozygous for the mutation. GMCSF was very high
in the patient's serum and bronchoalveolar lavage, but autoantibodies to
GMCSF were not found. In vitro studies showed that the patient's
monocytes failed to differentiate into macrophages after stimulation
with GMCSF. There was also a lack of STAT5 (601511) phosphorylation in
response to GMCSF or IL3 stimulation, suggesting defective signaling by
the common beta-subunit of the GMCSF receptor (CSF2RB). Flow cytometry
of patient monocytes showed lack of CSF2RB expression, and CSF2RB mRNA
was not detected in patient cells. Tanaka et al. (2011) speculated that
the late onset in this patient may have been due to compensatory
factors, such as increased serum GMCSF acting through an intact CSF2RA
subunit (306250) or increased levels of other inflammatory cells.

300108	TITLE *300108 DIAPHANOUS, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 2; DIAPH2
;;DIA;;
DIA2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the course of cloning the DIAPH1 gene (602121), which is mutant in
nonsyndromic deafness DFNA1 (124900), Lynch et al. (1997) identified
DIAPH2, a second human homolog of the Drosophila 'diaphanous' (dia)
gene. Mutant alleles of dia affect spermatogenesis or oogenesis and lead
to sterility. Castrillon and Wasserman (1994), who identified the dia
locus in Drosophila by screening for male-sterility mutations, found
that alterations in cytokinesis were associated with mutated dia
alleles.

Bione et al. (1998) identified DIAPH2, which they called DIA, as the
gene disrupted by a breakpoint in a family with premature ovarian
failure (POF2A; 300511), and they isolated several cDNAs. The use of
alternative last exons results in 2 DIAPH2 proteins that differ in their
C termini: DIAPH2-156, which uses exon 156 and contains 1,101 amino
acids, and DIAPH2-12C, which uses exon 12C and contains 1,096 amino
acids. The sequence encoded by exon 156 is significantly similar to the
comparable sequence of Drosophila dia, while the sequence encoded by
exon 12C is quite different. DIAPH2-156 and Drosophila dia share about
39% amino acid identity. Both DIAPH2 isoforms contain formin homology-1
(FH1) and FH2 domains that are flanked by 2 coiled-coil domains. DIAPH2
also has a predicted nuclear localization signal near its C terminus.
Bione et al. (1998) stated that DIAPH2 is the first human member of the
FH1/FH2 protein family. Members of this family affect cytokinesis and
other actin-mediated morphogenetic processes that are required in early
steps of development. Northern blot analysis of human adult and fetal
tissues detected 4 DIAPH2 transcripts, 3 of which were expressed
ubiquitously and the fourth exclusively in adult testis. Bione et al.
(1998) showed that the Diaph2 gene was expressed in developing ovaries
and testis of the mouse, as well as in all other tissues, from the E16
stage.

Using ARHD (605781) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell
cDNA library, Gasman et al. (2003) cloned a splice variant of DIAPH2
that they designated DIA2C. Compared with the DIAPH2-12C isoform, which
Gasman et al. (2003) referred to as DIA2B, DIA2C contains a deletion of
11 amino acids and an insertion of 7 amino acids in the N-terminal part
containing the GTPase-binding domain. Immunolocalization revealed that
epitope-tagged DIA2C was cytosolic, but when coexpressed with ARHD, the
2 proteins colocalized to early endosomes.

GENE FUNCTION

Gasman et al. (2003) demonstrated that the DIA2C splice variant
interacted with ARHD both in vivo and in vitro and that ARHD recruited
cytosolic DIA2C onto early endosomes. Coimmunoprecipitation of
cotransfected HeLa cells indicated that DIA2C interacted with ARHD in
the GTP-bound form. The interaction induced the alignment of early
endosomes along actin filaments and reduced their motility. In the
absence of ARHD, deletion of the DIA2C GTPase-binding domain led to
DIA2C localization to endosomes and blocked about 85% of endosomes in a
nonmotile state. Coexpression of DIA2C and ARHD in HeLa cells stimulated
SRC kinase (CSK; 124095) activity, which was required to alter endosome
motility. Gasman et al. (2003) concluded that DIA2C and SRC (190090) are
sequentially activated by ARHD to regulate the motility of early
endosomes through interaction with the actin cytoskeleton.

Yasuda et al. (2004) demonstrated that Cdc42 (116952) and mDia3, the
mouse homolog of DIAPH2, regulate microtubule attachment to
kinetochores.

Cheng et al. (2011) found that human DIA3 had an essential role in
metaphase chromosome alignment that depended on microtubule binding and
interaction with EB1 (MAPRE1; 603108), but not on actin binding.
Knockdown of DIA3 in human cell lines resulted in mitotic errors,
including anaphase delay and presence of unaligned chromosomes.
Coimmunoprecipitation and mutation analysis revealed that DIA3
independently interacted with EB1 and APC (611731), and interaction of
DIA3 with EB1 was required for metaphase chromosome alignment. Aurora B
(AURKB; 604970) phosphorylated DIA3 within its FH2 domain.
Dephosphorylated DIA3 bound along the length of purified microtubules,
and phosphorylation of DIA3 by Aurora B was essential for release of
DIA3 from microtubules and chromosome alignment.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bione et al. (1998) determined that the DIAPH2 gene spans about 1 Mb.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Bione et al. (1998) showed that a human EST corresponding to
DIAPH2 maps to chromosome Xq22. Banfi et al. (1997) had indicated that a
human homolog of diaphanous maps to Xq22. Lynch et al. (1997) noted that
a nonsyndromic form of X-linked deafness, DFN2 (304500), also maps to
Xq22, making the DIAPH2 gene a candidate for DFN2 hearing loss.

CYTOGENETICS

Bione et al. (1998) demonstrated that a balanced X(12) translocation
(300108.0001) in a family with premature ovarian failure (POF2A; 300511)
reported by Sala et al. (1997) had a breakpoint in the last intron of
the DIAPH2 gene. As a consequence of the translocation, Bione et al.
(1998) predicted that the DIAPH2 gene on the derivative X chromosome
could be fused to sequences from chromosome 12, resulting in the
possible synthesis of an altered protein. Alternatively, in the absence
of the last coding exon and of the 3-prime untranslated region,
truncated transcripts might be both unstable and prone to degradation
soon after transcription. Bione et al. (1998) commented that no deafness
was present in this family.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PREMATURE OVARIAN FAILURE 2A
DIAPH2, INTRONIC BREAKPOINT

In the family of patient BC studied by Sala et al. (1997), a balanced
X;12 translocation, t(X;12)(q21;p1.3), was associated with premature
ovarian failure (300511). Patient BC had secondary amenorrhea, with no
other associated features, at the age of 17 years. Her mother, who
carried the same chromosomal rearrangement, was diagnosed with premature
menopause at the age of 32 years. At diagnosis, both mother and daughter
had high gonadotropin levels and inactivation of the normal X chromosome
(Philippe et al., 1993). The breakpoint was mapped, by FISH, to a
specific YAC. The translocation breakpoint was found to be in the last
200-kb intron of the gene.

613918	TITLE *613918 HLA COMPLEX GROUP 22; HCG22
;;PANBRONCHIOLITIS-RELATED MUCIN-LIKE 2; PBMUCL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 6 linked to diffuse
panbronchiolitis (DPB; 604809), Hijikata et al. (2011) identified
PBMUCL1 (613917) and PBMUCL2, which they initially called G4 and G2,
respectively. They cloned the genes by RT-PCR and RACE of primary
cultured human bronchial epithelial cells. The deduced 251-amino acid
PBMUCL2 protein has an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by a
mucin-like domain of 15 tandem serine-, threonine-, and proline-rich
repeats of 11 amino acids each. The serines and threonines within the
mucin-like domain may be O-glycosylated, and PBMUCL2 has a putative
N-glycosylation site. RT-PCR analysis revealed expression in brain,
lung, spleen, thymus, and prostate, but not in 10 other tissues
examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hijikata et al. (2011) determined that the PBMUCL2 gene contains 4
coding exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hijikata et al. (2011) mapped the PBMUCL2
gene to a mucin gene cluster on chromosome 6p21.3. The order of the
clustered genes, from telomere to centromere, is DPCR1 (613928), MUC21,
PBMUCL1, and PBMUCL2.

611418	TITLE *611418 SMALL G PROTEIN SIGNALING MODULATOR 2; SGSM2
;;KIAA0397
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching with the sequence of small G protein signaling
modulator-1 (SGSM1; 611417) as query, followed by RT-PCR and RACE of a
human brain cDNA library, Yang et al. (2007) cloned SGSM2, which had
previously been cloned and named KIAA0397 by Ishikawa et al. (1997). The
deduced 1,051-amino acid SGSM2 protein contains an N-terminal RUN domain
and a C-terminal TBC domain. Like SGSM1 and SGSM3 (611418), SGSM2
contains a RAP (see RAP1A, 179520)-interacting domain (RAPID) (amino
acids 301-350), containing 5 blocks of conserved sequence following the
RUN motif. Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of 6.0-
and 9.4-kb SGSM2 transcripts in several human tissues. Mouse tissues
showed a similar expression profile of Sgsm2, with evidence of splice
variants.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses of proteins
expressed by transfected human embryonic kidney cells, Yang et al.
(2007) showed that SGSM1, SGSM2, and SGSM3 coimmunoprecipitated with all
RAP proteins examined, including RAP1A, RAP1B (179530), RAP2A (179540),
and RAP2B (179541). Yang et al. (2007) also found that endogenous Rab4
(179511) and Rab11 (see RAB11A, 605570) interacted with all of the SGSM
proteins in the mouse neuroblastoma cell line; however, Rab3 (see RAB3A,
179490), Rab5 (see RAB5A, 179512), and Rab8 (see RAB8A, 165040)
interacted only with SGSM1 and SGSM3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yang et al. (2007) determined that the SGSM2 gene contains 23 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the SGSM2
gene to chromosome 17. By genomic sequence analysis, Yang et al. (2007)
localized the gene to 17p13.3.
