DESCRIPTION See KRTHA1 (601077) for general information on hair keratins.

Rogers et al. (1998) and Langbein et al. (1999) reported the
identification of the KRTHA6 gene, which they called HA6. Rogers et al.
(1998) found that the deduced KRTHA6 protein has 468 amino acids. They
stated that KRTHA6 is probably identical to the minor type I hair
keratin HAX (Heid et al., 1988). The KRTHA6 gene contains 7 exons. By
RT-PCR, Rogers et al. (1998) showed that KRTHA6 is expressed in the
human hair follicle. See Langbein et al. (1999) for further details on
the expression pattern of the KRTHA6 gene in the hair follicle.

Rogers et al. (1998) isolated and characterized 2 overlapping human PAC
clones that cover 190 kb on 17q12-q21 and contain 9 type I hair keratin
genes, 1 transcribed hair keratin pseudogene, and 1 orphan exon. The
order of the genes is 5-prime--KRTHA6--KRTHA5 (602764)--KRTHA2
(602760)--orphan exon--KRTHA8 (604542)--KRTHA7
(604541)--pseudogene--KRTHA1--KRTHA4 (602763)--KRTHA3B (602762)--KRTHA3A
(602761)--3-prime. The hair keratin genes range in size from 4.2 to 7.5
kb, and the genes are separated from each other by 5.5 to 18.4 kb; all
are located within about 140 kb. Each gene is transcribed from the
5-prime to 3-prime direction. Based on sequence homologies, the genes
can be grouped into 3 subclusters of tandemly arranged genes. One
subcluster, group A, consists of KRTHA1, KRTHA3A, KRTHA3B, and KRTHA4,
which share 89% overall amino acid identity. A second subcluster, group
B, contains KRTHA7 and KRTHA8, as well as the hair keratin pseudogene,
which the authors called HAA. The functional hair keratins and
hypothetical HAA hair keratin share approximately 81% overall amino acid
identity. The third subcluster, group C, consists of the structurally
less related hair keratins KRTHA2, KRTHA5, and KRTHA6, which share about
70% amino acid identity.

613534	TITLE *613534 FANCD2/FANCI-ASSOCIATED NUCLEASE 1; FAN1
;;MYOTUBULARIN-RELATED PROTEIN 15; MTMR15;;
KIAA1018
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FAN1 is a DNA endo- and exonuclease involved in the repair of DNA damage
caused by crosslinking agents. FAN1 is recruited to sites of interstrand
cross linkage damage by interacting with the FANCI (611360)-FANCD2
(227646) complex (MacKay et al., 2010; Kratz et al., 2010; Smogorzewska
et al., 2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned FAN1, which they designated
KIAA1018. The deduced protein contains 1,017 amino acids. RT-PCR
analysis detected relatively uniform FAN1 expression in all adult and
fetal tissues and specific adult brain regions examined.

Kratz et al. (2010) stated that the FAN1 protein contains a predicted
N-terminal RAD18 (605256)-like ubiquitin (191339)-binding zinc finger
domain and a C-terminal nuclease domain.

Zhou et al. (2012) found expression of the FAN1 gene in multiple
parenchymatous human tissues, including the kidney, liver, neuronal
tissue, and female reproductive organs. The expression pattern differed
from that of FANCD2, which was found primarily in lymphatic and bone
marrow-derived sources, as well as in skin and testes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using tandem affinity purification and large-scale immunoprecipitation
analysis, followed by mass spectroscopy, Cannavo et al. (2007)
identified FAN1 as a protein that interacted with the mismatch repair
proteins MLH1 (120436), PMS1 (600258), and PMS2 (600259).

Independently, MacKay et al. (2010) and Kratz et al. (2010) found that
recombinant human FAN1 exhibited DNA endonuclease activity toward
5-prime flaps and had 5-prime exonuclease activity mediated by its
C-terminal nuclease domain. Only DNA damage caused by interstrand
crosslinking agents resulted in recruitment of FAN1 to sites of DNA
damage, and this recruitment required interaction of FAN1 with
monoubiquitinated FANCD2. Depletion of FAN1 sensitized human cell lines
to interstrand crosslinking agents and caused chromosomal instability.
Smogorzewska et al. (2010) reported similar findings and showed that
FAN1 required both FANCI and FANCD2 for localization at sites of DNA
damage.

A central event in the Fanconi pathway is monoubiquitylation of the
FANCI-FANCD2 protein complex. Liu et al. (2010) characterized FAN1,
which promotes interstrand crosslink repair in a manner strictly
dependent on its ability to accumulate at or near sites of DNA damage
and that relies on monoubiquitylation of the FANCI-FANCD2 complex. Liu
et al. (2010) concluded that the monoubiquitylated complex recruits the
downstream repair protein FAN1 and facilitates repair of DNA interstrand
crosslinks.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the FAN1
gene to chromosome 15.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 9 unrelated families with karyomegalic
interstitial nephritis (KMIN; 614817), Zhou et al. (2012) identified 12
different homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the FAN1 gene
(see, e.g., 613534.0001-613534.0008). Eight of the 12 mutations resulted
in a truncated protein. The first mutation was identified by
homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing in 1 affected family. Upon
exposure to mitomycin C, FAN1 mutant cells showed genomic instability,
as manifest by increased chromatid breaks and radial chromosomes on
metaphase spreads. Although the results of the test for Fanconi anemia
(see, e.g., 227650), diepoxybutane-induced breakage, were negative in
FAN1-mutant cells lines, these cells still showed decreased survival in
response to either inducer of interstrand crosslink repair (ICL)
compared to controls. Thus, there were subtle differences in cell
reaction between FANCA (607139)-mutant and FAN1-mutant cells, suggesting
that these proteins act in somewhat distinct manners. None of the FAN1
mutant proteins was able to correct mitomycin C-induced decreased
survival in cells lacking FAN1 nuclease activity. Morpholino knockdown
of Fan1 in zebrafish embryos resulted in a nephronophthisis (NPHP;
256100)-like phenotype, with shortened and curved body axis, as well as
a Fanconi anemia-like phenotype, with microcephaly, microphthalmia, and
massive apoptosis. There was evidence of activation of the DNA damage
repair pathway, as demonstrated by increased signaling for gamma-H2AX
(H2AFX; 601772). Knockdown of born Fan1 and p53 (191170) in zebrafish
caused renal cysts, reminiscent of a ciliopathy. In the fawn-hooded
hypertensive rat, an animal model of chronic kidney disease, as well as
in kidney samples from humans with genetically heterogeneous forms of
chronic kidney disease, Zhou et al. (2012) found increased nuclear
staining for gamma-H2AX, indicating activation of the DNA damage
response pathway. These findings supported the hypothesis that DNA
lesions and DNA damage response pathways may partially drive renal
damage in NPHP-related ciliopathies and in chronic kidney disease.

In 2 brothers of Maori descent with karyomegalic interstitial nephritis
(KMIN; 614817) (Palmer et al., 2007), Zhou et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous 2120G-A transition in exon 8 of the FAN1 gene, resulting in a
trp707-to-ter (W707X) substitution. The mutation was found by
homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing of the candidate region. The
mutation was not found in 96 controls.

In affected members of 2 French families with karyomegalic interstitial
nephritis (614817), Zhou et al. (2012) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the FAN1 gene. Both families carried a
T-to-A transition in intron 2 (1234+2T-A), resulting in a splice site
mutation on 1 allele. One family (Godin et al., 1996) carried a 2-bp
deletion in exon 7 (2036_7delGA; 613534.0003) on the second allele, and
the other family carried a 2245C-T transition in exon 9, resulting in an
arg749-to-ter (R749X; 613534.0004) substitution on the second allele.
None of the mutations were found in 96 controls, and haplotype analysis
suggested a founder effect for the splice site mutation.

and a 2810G-A transition in exon 13, resulting in a gly937-to-asp

610606	TITLE *610606 CYTOPLASMIC POLYADENYLATION ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 3; CPEB3
;;KIAA0940
CPEB3 RIBOZYME, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned CPEB3, which they designated
KIAA0940. RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression in brain, intermediate
expression in kidney, heart, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, testis,
ovary, pancreas, and fetal liver, and low expression in spleen and fetal
brain. CPEB3 was expressed in all specific adult brain regions examined,
with highest levels in amygdala and substantia nigra.

Salehi-Ashtiani et al. (2006) stated that CPEB3 transcripts use 2
alternate untranslated first exons, one expressed in liver and testis,
and the other expressed in brain. The 698-amino acid CPEB3 protein has
an N-terminal glutamine-rich domain, followed by 2 RNA recognition
motifs and a C-terminal zinc finger domain. The glutamine-rich domain is
not present in other CPEBs.

- CPEB3 Ribozyme

Using an in vitro self-selection technique, Salehi-Ashtiani et al.
(2006) identified self-cleaving ribozymes associated with olfactory
receptor OR4K15, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R; 147370),
a LINE-1 retrotransposon (see LRE1; 151626), and CPEB3. The CPEB3
ribozyme is located within intron 3 and is structurally related to
ribozymes from human hepatitis delta virus (HDV), a single-stranded RNA
satellite virus for hepatitis B infection (see 610424). EST database
analysis and RT-PCR of human and mouse total RNA extracts indicated that
the CPEB3 ribozyme is expressed and self-cleaves in vivo.
Salehi-Ashtiani et al. (2006) identified the CPEB3 ribozyme only in
mammalian vertebrates. They proposed that HDV ribozymes and the CPEB3
ribozyme are evolutionarily related, and that HDV arose from the human
transcriptome.

GENE FUNCTION

- CPEB3 Ribozyme

Salehi-Ashtiani et al. (2006) narrowed the active sequence of the CPEB3
ribozyme to 81 nucleotides. This 81-nucleotide construct cleaved to
produce a 9-nucleotide upstream fragment containing a 2-prime-to-3-prime
cyclic phosphate, and a 72-nucleotide downstream fragment containing a
5-prime terminal hydroxyl that could be phosphorylated with
polynucleotide kinase (PNKP; 605610). The ribozyme had a low Mg(2+)
requirement, and was also active in the presence of Mn(2+) and Ca(2+).
Ribozyme activity was almost constant between pH 5.5 and 8.5, suggesting
the presence of 2 functional groups.

GENE STRUCTURE

Salehi-Ashtiani et al. (2006) reported that the CPEB3 gene spans 242 kb
and contains 11 exons, including 2 alternatively spliced, untranslated
first exons. Intron 3 spans 46 kb and contains a ribozyme.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the CPEB3 gene
to chromosome 10.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Sidow et al. (1999) reported the positional cloning of the gene
disrupted in the mouse mutant dactylaplasia (Dac). The Dac gene belongs
to the F-box/WD40 gene family, which encodes adaptors that target
specific proteins for destruction by presenting them to the
ubiquitination machinery. In connection with biochemical studies, this
report demonstrated the importance of this gene family in vertebrate
embryonic development. Sidow et al. (1999) designated the Dac protein
product dactylin. Two different alleles of Dac were found to be due to
insertions, a common mechanism of mutation in the mouse (see ANIMAL
MODEL).

By positional cloning in the critical region for the split-hand/foot
malformation-3 locus (SHFM3; 246560) on chromosome 10q24, EST database
searching, and RT-PCR, Ianakiev et al. (1999) generated a cDNA encoding
human dactylin. Sequence analysis predicted that the 412-amino acid
putative cytoplasmic protein contains an N-terminal F box and 4
C-terminal WD40 domains. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous
expression of a 2.8-kb transcript that is strongest in fetal brain,
followed by kidney, lung, and liver. In situ hybridization of a
5.5-week-old mouse embryo confirmed the expression of dactylin in the
central nervous system and liver as well as at low levels in the
mesoderm and ectoderm of the developing limb. The data suggested to
Ianakiev et al. (1999) that dactylin is likely to be involved in
signaling pathways crucial for normal limb development and that it is a
candidate gene for SHFM3.

Ilyin et al. (2000) independently cloned human dactylin, which they
termed FBWD4.

By sequence and computational analyses, Salzman et al. (2012) identified
hundreds of transcripts that showed noncanonical ordering of exons in
pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples and normal human
leukocytes. The most abundant transcripts with scrambled exons
originated from the FBXW4, CAMSAP1 (613774), and ZKSCAN1 (601260) genes.
RT-PCR of human cells confirmed the findings. Transcripts with scrambled
exons appeared to be circular, as they showed lack of polyadenylation
and resistance to 5-prime exoribonuclease activity. Endogenous circular
and linear FBXW4 and CAMSAP1 transcripts were detected in both the
cytoplasm and nucleus of fractionated HeLa cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ianakiev et al. (1999) determined that the DAC gene contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ianakiev et al. (1999) identified the
human DAC gene in the critical region for the SHFM3 locus on chromosome
10q24. Using FISH, Ianakiev et al. (1999) mapped the DAC gene to
chromosome 10q24.3. They identified a pseudogene at the breakpoint
cluster region on chromosome 22q11.2 that shares greater than 93%
nucleotide identity with the DAC gene.

Jin et al. (2004) reported that the mouse Fbxw4 gene maps to chromosome
19C3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

De Mollerat et al. (2003) conducted mutation analysis of the dactylin
gene in 7 patients with split-hand/foot malformation (SHFM) and found no
point mutations. However, Southern blot, pulsed field gel
electrophoresis, and dosage analyses demonstrated a complex
rearrangement associated with a 0.5-Mb tandem duplication in all the
patients. The distal and proximal breakpoints were within 80- and 130-kb
regions, respectively; the smallest duplicated region common to all
patients was 444 kb and contained a disrupted extra copy of the dactylin
gene from exon 9 to exon 6, as well as the entire LBX1 (604255), BTRC
(603482), and POLL (606343) genes.

Because structural alterations of the gene encoding dactylin lead to
reduced levels of transcript in the mouse mutant Dac, which resembles
human SHFM, Basel et al. (2003) studied several individuals with SHFM
and reported a significant decrease of dactylin transcript. This
observation supported a central role for dactylin in the pathogenesis of
SHFM3.

Kano et al. (2005) screened 28 Japanese families with nonsyndromic SHFM
for tandem genomic duplication of chromosome 10q24 by Southern blot and
sequence analysis of the dactylin gene. No mutations were found in
coding regions and flanking intronic sequences of the dactylin gene, but
2 families had genomic rearrangements. One was a 511.6-kb tandem
duplication, and the other was a 447.3-kb duplication containing the
LBX1, BTRC, POLL, and DPCD genes and a disrupted extra copy of the
dactylin gene. Kano et al. (2005) noted that the smaller duplicated
region was almost identical to that described by de Mollerat et al.
(2003).

ANIMAL MODEL

Dactylaplasia, a mouse model of SHFM3, is an inherited limb malformation
that depends on 2 loci. The first locus, Dac, is an insertional mutation
around the dactylin gene that is inherited as a semidominant trait. Two
independent, spontaneous Dac alleles, Dac(1J) and Dac(2J), have been
identified. The second locus, Mdac, is a modifier on chromosome 13 that
is polymorphic in inbred strains. The dominant Mdac allele suppresses
the dactylaplasia phenotype in Dac mice, whereas the recessive Mdac
allele does not. Thus, dactylaplasia is observed only in mice homozygous
for the recessive Mdac allele. Kano et al. (2007) showed that the Dac
insertion is an LTR retrotransposon caused by the type D mouse
endogenous provirus element (MusD), which contains intact ORFs for the
viral gag, pro, and pol genes. In Dac(2J), MusD is inserted in intron 5
of the dactylin gene and no dactylin transcripts are expressed. In
Dac(1J), MusD is inserted in the upstream region of dactylin and neither
the size nor the amount of dactylin transcripts are affected. Kano et
al. (2007) refined the Mdac locus to a 9.4-Mb region on chromosome 13.
Dac mutants homozygous for the recessive Mdac allele had unmethylated
CpGs and active chromatin at the LTR of the MusD insertion, as well
ectopic expression of MusD elements. In contrast, Dac mutants carrying
the dominant Mdac allele had heavily methylated CpGs and inactive
chromatin at the LTR of the insertion, correlating with inhibition of
the dactylaplasia phenotype. Ectopic expression of MusD was not observed
in mice carrying the dominant Mdac allele. Kano et al. (2007) concluded
that ectopic expression of the MusD insertion, rather than lack of
dactylin expression, correlates with the dactylaplasia phenotype. They
proposed the Mdac acts a defensive factor to protect the host genome
from pathogenic MusD insertions.

614715	TITLE *614715 TRANSMEMBRANE AND IMMUNOGLOBULIN DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; TMIGD2
;;IMMUNOGLOBULIN AND PROLINE-RICH RECEPTOR 1; IGPR1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TMIGD2 is widely expressed on the plasma membrane of endothelial and
epithelial cells and contributes to cell adhesion and migration (Rahimi
et al., 2012).

CLONING

By searching databases for genes encoding proteins with an
immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain, Rahimi et al. (2012) identified TMIGD2,
which they called IGPR1. The deduced 282-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 31 kD. It contains an N-terminal signal
sequence, followed by an extracellular Ig-like domain, a transmembrane
domain, and a cytoplasmic proline-rich C-terminal domain. The N-terminal
extracellular region contains 2 putative glycosylation sites. The Ig
domain was predicted to assume an Ig V (variable) fold structure.
Orthologs of IGPR1 were detected in several mammalian species, but not
in rat or mouse. Quantitative PCR revealed high IGPR1 expression in
artery, vein, and brain, with low to moderate expression in other
tissues. Western blot analysis detected an IGPR1 protein with an
apparent molecular mass of 55 kD in thymus, placenta, heart, small
intestine, skin, and kidney. An IGPR1 protein with an apparent molecular
mass of 35 kD was expressed in skeletal muscle, brain, colon, lung, and
ovary. Immunohistochemical analysis showed IGPR1 expression mainly in
epithelial and endothelial cells, and IGPR1 was expressed on the plasma
membrane of transfected porcine aorta endothelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Rahimi et al. (2012) found that overexpression of IGPR1 in porcine or
human endothelial cells increased tube formation in 3-dimensional
cultures. IGPR1 overexpression also increased angiogenesis in mouse
melanoma cells following injection into mice. In contrast, knockdown of
IGPR1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells reduced capillary tube
formation. IGPR1 overexpression also altered adhesion, migration, and
morphology of actin stress fibers in transfected cells. Protein
interaction assays revealed that the isolated proline-rich cytoplasmic
region of IGPR1 interacted with SH3 domains in several proteins, notably
SPIN90 (NCKIPSD; 606671). In porcine or human endothelial cells,
overexpression or knockdown of SPIN90 increased and decreased,
respectively, tube formation in 3-dimensional culture. Rahimi et al.
(2012) hypothesized that interaction between IGPR1 and SPIN90 regulates
angiogenesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rahimi et al. (2012) reported that the TMIGD2 gene contains at least 4
exons.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the TMIGD2 gene to chromosome 19p13.3 based on an
alignment of the TMIGD2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC015655) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

602981	TITLE *602981 AE-BINDING PROTEIN 1; AEBP1
;;AORTIC CARBOXYPEPTIDASE-LIKE PROTEIN; ACLP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Vascular smooth muscle cells originate from diverse cell types during
embryonic development and acquire different phenotypes in disease
states. The interactions of these cells with the extracellular matrix
(ECM) are important in governing these processes. By screening a human
aortic smooth muscle cell expression library for proteins that interact
with the E47 product of E2A (TCF3; 147141), Layne et al. (1998) isolated
a full-length cDNA encoding ACLP. The deduced 1,158-amino acid ACLP
protein contains a putative signal peptide; an 11-residue lys/pro-rich
motif repeated 4 times in the N terminus; a domain with 30% identity to
the slime mold adhesion protein discoidin I; and a C-terminal 500-amino
acid domain with 39% identity to carboxypeptidase E (CPE; 114855).
Northern blot analysis detected a 4.0-kb ACLP transcript. Immunoblot
analysis showed expression of a 175-kD ACLP protein. Western blot
analysis and in situ hybridization established that expression of ACLP
is largely restricted to aorta, particularly to smooth muscle cells.
Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated perinuclear staining in mouse
aortic smooth muscle cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By purification of aortic smooth muscle cells from day-18.5 mouse
embryos, followed by immunoblot analysis, Layne et al. (2001) showed
that Aclp is a secreted protein that associates with the ECM, as
predicted from its primary structure. Immunohistochemistry of day-15.5
mouse embryos revealed wide expression of Aclp in vascular smooth muscle
cells, in bony and cartilaginous skeleton (skull, vertebrae, and ribs),
in the basement membrane of lung airways, and in the dermis.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Layne et al. (2001) determined that the
mouse Aclp gene contains 21 exons.

ANIMAL MODEL

By homologous recombination, Layne et al. (2001) generated Aclp -/-
mice. Although heterozygotes were phenotypically normal, most Aclp -/-
mice succumbed around the time of birth with gastroschisis, an extrusion
of the abdominal viscera through the ventral body wall. Gastoschisis
appeared as early as day 13.5. Many dead neonates were pale and had
missing abdominal organs, such as liver and intestine. Aclp -/- mice
that survived to adulthood had large, nonhealing skin lesions, deficient
wound repair, and poor fibroblast proliferation. Layne et al. (2001)
concluded that ACLP has important roles in both embryonic development
and adult tissue repair.

HISTORY

Layne et al. (1998) found that the C terminus of ACLP is highly
homologous to AEBP1, which was originally identified in mouse by He et
al. (1995) as a factor that specifically binds AE1 and acts as a
repressor of aP2 gene (600434) expression. Aebp1 contains a region that
is 40% identical to the regulatory carboxypeptidases CPH/E, CPN
(212070), and CPM (114860). He et al. (1995) found that CP activity was
important for the transcriptional repression activity of Aebp1 and
suggested that Aebp1 regulates transcription by cleavage of factors
involved in transcription. Ohno et al. (1996) identified human AEBP1 as
a gene whose cDNAs were found exclusively in osteoblast and adipose
tissue libraries. The predicted 845-amino acid human AEBP1 protein is
95% identical to mouse Aebp1 except for an additional 105 amino acids in
the N terminus of the human protein. This N-terminal extension contains
a nuclear targeting signal. Northern blot analysis of various human
tissues detected a 3-kb AEBP1 mRNA only in osteoblasts and adipose
tissues.

Song and Fricker (1997), however, reported that AEBP1 has no
carboxypeptidase activity; in contrast, CPZ (603105), CPE, and CPD
(603102) were found to have modest or abundant activity. Layne et al.
(1998) determined that the Aebp1 sequence described by He et al. (1995)
lacks a G residue 11 bases 5-prime of the proposed start codon and is
likely an incomplete clone of mouse Aclp. Northern blot analysis, even
with Aepb1-derived probes, detected a single 4.0-kb transcript, which is
consistent with the size of the human and mouse ACLP cDNAs. Furthermore,
Layne (2001) stated that they have never detected nuclear localization
of ACLP, nor have they detected any ACLP splice variants that might
account for the discrepant data, suggesting that the human sequence
reported by Ohno et al. (1996) is also a truncated clone.
