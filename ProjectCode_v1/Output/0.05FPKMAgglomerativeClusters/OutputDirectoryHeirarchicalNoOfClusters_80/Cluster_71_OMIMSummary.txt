613904	TITLE *613904 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 569; ZNF569
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZNF569 belongs to a large family of transcription factors characterized
by an N-terminal Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain and tandem
C-terminal C2H2-type zinc fingers (Huang et al., 2006).

CLONING

Using the KRAB domain consensus sequence to search EST databases,
followed by PCR of an early embryonic human heart cDNA library, Huang et
al. (2006) cloned ZNF569. The deduced 686-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 79.6 kD. It has a classical N-terminal
KRAB-A domain, followed by 18 tandem Kruppel C2H2-type zinc fingers
extending to the C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected high
expression of a 2.06-kb ZNF569 transcript in adult heart, skeletal
muscle, and liver and in fetal heart, skeletal muscle, and brain. It was
also expressed more weakly in adult and fetal pancreas and placenta,
with little to no expression detected in other tissues.
Fluorescence-tagged ZNF569 localized predominantly to nuclei of
transfected COS-7 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By cotransfecting COS-7 cells with ZNF569 and a reporter gene system,
Huang et al. (2006) showed that ZNF569 suppressed the endogenous
transcriptional activities of the serum response element (SRE) and AP1
(165160). Domain analysis revealed that both the KRAB domain and the
zinc finger motifs of ZNF569 suppressed transcriptional activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Huang et al. (2006) determined that the ZNF569 gene contains 6 exons and
spans approximately 56.3 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Huang et al. (2006) mapped the ZNF569 gene
to chromosome 19q13.12.
