147582	TITLE *147582 IRON-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 2; IREB2
;;IRE-BINDING PROTEIN 2; IRP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Rouault et al. (1990) identified a second IRE-binding protein, for which
the degenerate screening of the oligonucleotide used in identifying the
cDNA for IREB1 (100880) also served as a successful sequencing primer.
The second IREBP, represented by 'clone 10.1,' contained an inserted
stretch of 73 amino acids between amino acids 37 and 38 of IREB1; the
IREB2 gene product lacked a region homologous to the sequences between
amino acids 436 and 470 of IREB1.

GENE FUNCTION

Hentze and Kuhn (1996) reviewed the function of IRP2. IRP2 is less
abundant than IRP1 (IREB1) in most cells. The strongest expression is in
intestine and brain (Henderson et al., 1993). Human IRP2 is 57%
identical to human IRP1. IRP2 has a molecular mass of 105 kD, which is
slightly larger than that of IRP1 due to a 73-amino acid insertion. Iwai
et al. (1995) demonstrated that the 73-amino acid insertion mediates
IRP2 degradation in iron-replete cells. Guo et al. (1994) and Samaniego
et al. (1994) showed that IRP2 has no aconitase activity.

Wu et al. (1999) demonstrated that the c-myc (190080) protein stimulates
expression of IRP2.

Meyron-Holtz et al. (2004) found that IRP2-null cells misregulated iron
metabolism when cultured in 3 to 6% oxygen, which is comparable to
physiologic tissue concentrations, but not in 21% oxygen, a
concentration that activated IRP1 (100880) and allowed it to substitute
for IRP2. Thus, IRP2 dominates regulation of mammalian iron homeostasis
because it alone registers iron concentrations and modulates its
RNA-binding activity at physiologic oxygen tensions.

Vashisht et al. (2009) found that a SKP1 (601434)-CUL1 (603134)-FBXL5
(605655) ubiquitin ligase protein complex associates with and promotes
the iron-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of IRP2. The F-box
substrate adaptor protein FBXL5 was degraded upon iron and oxygen
depletion in a process that required an iron-binding hemerythrin-like
domain in its N terminus. Thus, Vashisht et al. (2009) concluded that
iron homeostasis is regulated by a proteolytic pathway that couples IRP2
degradation to intracellular iron levels through the stability and
activity of FBXL5.

Salahudeen et al. (2009) independently found that the E3 ubiquitin
ligase complex containing the FBXL5 protein targets IRP2 for proteasomal
degradation. The stability of FBXL5 itself was regulated, accumulating
under iron- and oxygen-replete conditions and degraded upon iron
depletion. FBXL5 contains an iron- and oxygen-binding hemerythrin domain
that acted as a ligand-dependent regulatory switch mediating FBXL5's
differential stability. Salahudeen et al. (2009) concluded that these
observations suggested a mechanistic link between iron sensing via the
FBXL5 hemerythrin domain, IRP2 regulation, and cellular responses to
maintain mammalian iron homeostasis.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNAs, Rouault et al. (1990)
assigned the IREB2 gene to chromosome 15.

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the IREB2
gene and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, see 606963.

ANIMAL MODEL

LaVaute et al. (2001) showed that in mice, targeted disruption of the
Ireb2 gene resulted in misregulation of iron metabolism in the
intestinal mucosa and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous
system. In adulthood, Ireb2 -/- mice developed a movement disorder
characterized by ataxia, bradykinesia, and tremor. Significant
accumulations of iron in white matter tracts and nuclei throughout the
brain preceded the onset of neurodegeneration and movement disorder
symptoms by many months. Ferric iron accumulated in the cytosol of
neurons and oligodendrocytes in distinctive regions of the brain.
Abnormal accumulations of ferritin colocalized with iron accumulations
in populations of neurons that degenerated. Ireb2 -/- mice initially
grew and developed normally. Mice older than 6 months of age developed a
progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized initially by an
unsteady, wide-based gait and subtle kyphosis followed by gradual onset
of ataxia, vestibular dysfunction, tremor, bradykinesia, and postural
abnormalities. Balance and grip strength measured using the hanging wire
test indicated severe impairment, whereas heterozygous mice showed an
intermediate degree of impairment.

Ghosh et al. (2008) reported that administration of tempol, a stable
nitroxide, to Irp2-null mice attenuated the progression of neuromuscular
impairment. In cell lines derived form Irp2-null mice and in the
cerebellum, brainstem, and forebrain of animals maintained on the tempol
diet, Irp1 was converted from a cytosolic aconitase to an IRE-binding
protein that stabilized the transferrin receptor-1 (TFRC; 190010)
transcript and repressed ferritin synthesis. Ghosh et al. (2008)
suggested that tempol protected Irp2-null mice by disassembling the
cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster of Irp1 and activating IRE binding
activity, which stabilized the TFRC transcript, repressed ferritin
synthesis, and partially restored normal cellular iron homeostasis in
the brain.

605176	TITLE *605176 HYDROXYACID OXIDASE 2; HAO2
;;HAOX2;;
HYDROXYACID OXIDASE, LONG-CHAIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

2-Hydroxyacid oxidases can oxidize a broad range of 2-hydroxyacids,
ranging from glycolate to long-chain 2-hydroxy fatty acids such as
2-hydroxypalmitate. These enzymes utilize a flavin cofactor and convert
2-hydroxyacids to 2-ketoacids with the concomitant reduction of
molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide.

CLONING

The plant glycolate oxidase (GOX; EC 1.1.3.15), which has an essential
role in photorespiration, is a prototypic 2-hydroxyacid oxidase. By
searching an EST database for human cDNAs capable of encoding proteins
with sequence similarity to spinach GOX, Jones et al. (2000) identified
HAO1 (605023) and HAO2; they stated in an erratum that the cDNA they had
identified as human HAO3 (HAOX3) actually belonged to mouse. The
predicted 351-amino acid HAO2 protein, which the authors called HAOX2,
terminates in the consensus type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1)
serine-arginine-leucine. Indirect immunofluorescence indicated that HAO2
localizes to the peroxisome. HAO2 shares 46.7% amino acid sequence
identity identity with spinach GOX and 46.0% identity with HAO1.
Recombinant HAO2 had 2-hydroxyacid oxidase activity, with highest
activity toward 2-hydroxypalmitate. Northern blot analysis of 16 human
tissues detected an approximately 2.0-kb HAO2 transcript at high levels
in both liver and kidney, and at a low level in thymus.

MAPPING

Jones et al. (2000) noted that a region of the HAO2 gene corresponds to
an STS on chromosome 1.

605765	TITLE *605765 DELETED IN LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA, 1; DLEU1
;;LEU1;;
B-CELL NEOPLASIA-ASSOCIATED GENE WITH MULTIPLE SPLICING; BCMS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Loss of chromosome 13q14 is a frequent cytogenetic change in B-cell
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL; see 109543), suggesting the presence
of a putative tumor suppressor gene at this locus. By constructing a
detailed restriction and transcriptional map of a 130-kb minimally
deleted region, screening a panel of primary BCLL clones, EST database
searching, and deletion mapping, Liu et al. (1997) identified 2 genes,
DLEU1 and DLEU2 (605766), which they called Leu1 and Leu2, in a 10-kb
minimally deleted area. The DLEU1 gene encodes a deduced 72-amino acid
protein. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 1.1-kb
transcript, with strong expression in testis, thymus, and small
intestine and lower expression in prostate, spleen, peripheral blood
lymphocytes, and ovary.

Wolf et al. (2001) determined that DLEU1 is only a small portion of a
large gene, which they designated B-cell neoplasia-associated gene with
multiple splicing (BCMS), that spans all critical subregions for BCLL,
including the distal subregion. They found that the gene is expressed in
more than 20 RNA splicing variants. While tissue-specific expression of
RNA variants was observed, there was no evidence for the expression of a
variant specific for BCLL. Sequence analysis of the RNA variants
suggested that BCMS transcripts belong to the group of noncoding RNAs.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liu et al. (1997) determined that the DLEU1 gene lacks a TATA box but
has several potential cis-acting DNA elements. Genomic sequence analysis
determined that DLEU1 and DLEU2 are approximately 300 bp apart, arranged
in a head-to-head manner, and transcribed in opposite directions.
Mutation analysis failed to detect any intragenic or point mutations,
but the first exon of each gene was deleted in all cases of 13q14 loss
examined. Liu et al. (1997) proposed that DLEU1 and DLEU2 are candidate
tumor suppressor genes in BCLL.

Wolf et al. (2001) determined that the BCMS gene contains at least 50
exons spanning 560 kb or more of genomic DNA. The alignment of the gene
with all critical subregions for BCLL was consistent with BCMS being the
most likely candidate for the tumor suppressor gene in 13q14 involved in
the leukemogenesis of BCLL.

603320	TITLE *603320 MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 23A; MMP23A
;;MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 21, FORMERLY; MMP21, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The matrix metalloproteinases are secreted glycoproteins that are
involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix. By analysis of
the genomic region surrounding the duplicated genes CDC2L1 (176873) and
CDC2L2 (116951), Gururajan et al. (1998) identified 2 novel matrix
metalloproteinase genes, MMP23A, which they called MMP21, and MMP23B
(603321), which they called MMP22. The nucleotide sequences of MMP21 and
MMP22 are nearly identical. Using a combination of techniques, the
authors isolated cDNAs corresponding to alternatively spliced
transcripts that encode 3 protein isoforms, MMP21/22A, MMP21/22B, and
MMP21/22C. The MMP21 and MMP22 proteins contain prepro-, catalytic,
cysteine-rich, IL1R (147810)-related, and proline-rich domains. Northern
blot analysis revealed that a 1.4-kb MMP21/22 transcript was expressed
in heart, placenta, ovary, testis, and prostate. A 0.8-kb mRNA was
detected in heart and pancreas, and an additional 2.4-kb mRNA was
detected in ovary.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gururajan et al. (1998) determined that the MMP21 and MMP22 genes
contain 8 exons each, and the exons generally correspond to the
structural domains of the putative protein products.

MAPPING

Gururajan et al. (1998) reported that the MMP21 and MMP22 genes are
located within an approximately 140-kb region on chromosome 1p36.3. This
region consists of 2 identical genomic segments, each of which contains
a CDC2L gene linked to an MMP gene. The 3-prime end of the MMP gene is
500 to 800 bp from the 3-prime end of the adjacent CDC2L gene. The genes
are arranged in the order
telomere--MMP22--CDC2L2--CDC2L1--MMP21--centromere. The 2 CDC2L genes
are separated by approximately 50 kb. Gururajan et al. (1998) stated
that although the functional significance of the reiteration of selected
genes within the 1p36.3 region is not known, it might reflect
instability relevant to the observed deletion of 1p36 during
tumorigenesis.

612466	TITLE *612466 GUANYLATE-BINDING PROTEIN 4; GBP4
;;GUANYLATE-BINDING PROTEIN 3, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Guanylate-binding proteins, such as GBP4, are induced by interferon and
hydrolyze GTP to both GDP and GMP (Vestal, 2005).

CLONING

Vestal (2005) reported that the 642-amino acid GBP4 protein shares 50 to
55% identity with GBP1 (600411), GBP2 (600412), and GBP5 (611467). GBP4
contains a GTP-binding domain, but it lacks a C-terminal CaaX
isoprenylation motif found in the other 3 GBPs.

Olszewski et al. (2006) found that GBP4 shares 74% and 81% amino acid
identity with GBP6 (612467) and GBP7 (612468), respectively. All GBPs,
including GBP4, have a conserved N-terminal globular GTP-binding domain
containing 2 consensus sequences and a third T(L/V)RD sequence not found
in other GTPases. GBP4 has a unique 15-amino acid group at its N
terminus that is not found in other GBPs. EST database analysis
indicated wide expression of GBP4 in human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RT-PCR, Tripal et al. (2007) detected expression of GBP4 in
endothelial cells after stimulation with IFNG (147570), but not after
stimulation with TNF (191160) or IL1B (147720). Immunofluorescence
analysis demonstrated nucleocytoplasmic expression of GBP4.

GENE STRUCTURE

Olszewski et al. (2006) determined that the GBP4 gene contains 11 exons,
like other GBPs. However, unlike other GBPs, translation of GBP4 begins
in exon 1 rather than exon 2.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Olszewski et al. (2006) mapped the GBP4
gene to the GBP gene cluster on chromosome 1p22.2. It is located
telomeric to GBP5 and centromeric to GBP7.

602931	TITLE *602931 MOTHERS AGAINST DECAPENTAPLEGIC, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 6; SMAD6
;;MADH6;;
SMA- AND MAD-RELATED PROTEIN 6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MAD-related proteins, named for Drosophila 'mothers against
decapentaplegic,' act as second messengers distal to the transforming
growth factor-beta family of receptors (e.g., TGFBR1; 190181).

CLONING

Using a differential display approach in cultured endothelial cells
subjected to multiple soluble and biomechanical stimuli, Topper et al.
(1997) isolated a human endothelial cell cDNA encoding MADH6, which they
called SMAD6. The predicted 235-amino acid MADH6 protein exhibits
significant sequence similarity to other human MAD-related proteins,
including the presence of a C-terminal MH2 domain; however, it lacks the
conserved N-terminal MH1 domain, and certain conserved C-terminal serine
residues that are involved in receptor-mediated phosphorylation. In situ
hybridization and immunohistochemical studies on human tissues showed
that MADH6 is expressed predominantly in vascular endothelium.

MAPPING

Riggins et al. (1996) reported an expressed sequence tag containing the
C-terminal sequence of MADH6. By PCR screening of a somatic cell hybrid
panel and YACs, they mapped the MADH6 gene to 15q21-q22.

GENE FUNCTION

Topper et al. (1997) demonstrated that MADH6 and MADH7 (602932) can form
complexes in endothelial cells. MADH6 was induced in cultured vascular
endothelium by fluid mechanical forces, and it modulated endothelial
gene expression in response to both humoral and biomechanical stimuli in
vitro.

Galvin et al. (2000) explored the role of an inhibitory SMAD in vivo by
targeted mutation of Madh6, which encodes the Smad6 protein, in mice.
Targeted insertion of a LacZ reporter demonstrated that Smad6 expression
is largely restricted to the heart and blood vessels, and that Madh6
mutants have multiple cardiovascular abnormalities. Hyperplasia of the
cardiac valves and outflow tract septation defects indicated a function
of Smad6 in the regulation of endocardial cushion transformation. The
role of Smad6 in the homeostasis of the adult cardiovascular system was
indicated by the development of aortic ossification and elevated blood
pressure in viable mutants. These defects highlighted the importance of
SMAD6 in the tissue-specific modulation of TGFB superfamily signaling
pathways in vivo.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 patients with bicuspid aortic valve and aortic valve stenosis
(AOVD2; 614823), 1 of whom also had aortic coarctation, Tan et al.
(2012) identified heterozygosity for missense mutations in the SMAD6
gene (602931.0001, 602931.0002). Neither mutation was found in more than
1,800 controls, and both mutants had significantly lower activity than
wildtype SMAD6.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AORTIC VALVE DISEASE 2
SMAD6, CYS484PHE

In a man with bicuspid aortic valve, aortic valve stenosis, and
coarctation and calcification of the aorta (AOVD2; 614823), Tan et al.
(2012) identified heterozygosity for a nonsynonymous variant in exon 4
of SMAD6, resulting in a cys484-to-phe (C484F) substitution at a highly
conserved residue within the MH2 domain. The mutation was not found in
1,000 Caucasian controls of British ancestry, in 629 individuals in the
1000 Genomes project, or in 200 individuals in the Danish Exome Project.
Functional analysis demonstrated that the MH2 domain of the mutant
protein inhibited BMP (see 112264) signaling less efficiently than the
equivalent domain of wildtype SMAD6, with relative luciferase readings
that were 24-fold higher than wildtype. Tan et al. (2012) suggested that
C484F could be considered a null allele, since there was almost no
inhibitory effect on BMPR1A (601299) activity in the assay.

.0002
AORTIC VALVE DISEASE 2
SMAD6, PRO415LEU

In an infant with bicuspid aortic valve and moderate aortic stenosis
(AOVD2; 614823), Tan et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for a
nonsynonymous variant in exon 4 of SMAD6, resulting in a pro415-to-leu
(P415L) substitution at a highly conserved residue within the MH2
domain. The mutation was not found in 1,000 Caucasian controls of
British ancestry, in 629 individuals in the 1000 Genomes project, or in
200 individuals in the Danish Exome Project. Functional analysis
demonstrated that the MH2 domain of the mutant protein inhibited BMP
(see 112264) signaling less efficiently than the equivalent domain of
wildtype SMAD6, with relative luciferase readings that were 7-fold
higher than wildtype, consistent with a hypomorphic allele.

;;PCTAIRE PROTEIN KINASE 3; PCTK3;;
PCTAIRE3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The PCTAIRE protein kinases comprise a distinct subfamily of the CDC2
(116940)-related serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. See PCTK1
(311550). Meyerson et al. (1992) isolated a partial cDNA encoding
PCTAIRE3. Like other members of the PCTAIRE subfamily, the predicted
PCTAIRE3 protein contains an N-terminal extension relative to CDC2. The
CDC2-related region of PCTAIRE3, excluding the N-terminal extension,
shares 51%, 79%, and 80% protein sequence identity with CDC2, PCTK1, and
PCTK2 (603440), respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that
PCTAIRE3 is expressed in a variety of human cell lines and tissues.
Okuda et al. (1992) identified the mouse homolog of PCTK3.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Okuda et al. (1994) mapped the
CDK18 gene to 1q31-q32.

602521	TITLE *602521 MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 7; MAPK7
;;PROTEIN KINASE, MITOGEN-ACTIVATED, 7; PRKM7;;
EXTRACELLULAR SIGNAL-REGULATED KINASE 5; ERK5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs, or PRKMs) are activated by an
upstream cascade of kinases in response to a wide variety of
extracellular stimuli. Specific PRKM kinases (MAPKKs, or PRKMKs) have
been shown to phosphorylate and activate specific PRKMs in a given
signaling pathway. Using the yeast 2-hybrid system with mutant forms of
PRKMK5 (602520) as baits, Zhou et al. (1995) identified a cDNA encoding
MAPK7, called ERK5 by them. They demonstrated that MAPK7 interacts
specifically with PRKMK5, but not with PRKMK1 (176872) or PRKMK2
(601263), suggesting that the PRKMK5/MAPK7 protein cascade is a novel
signaling pathway. The 815-amino acid MAPK7 contains the conserved
thr-glu-tyr activation motif of ERK-type MAPKs. MAPK7 has an
uncharacteristic 400-amino acid C-terminal domain with sequences
indicating that it may be targeted to the cytoskeleton. Zhou et al.
(1995) found that full-length MAPK7 has no detectable kinase activity in
vitro, whereas removal of the C terminus results in autophosphorylation,
suggesting that the C terminus may play a role in regulating MAPK7.
Northern blot analysis detected a 3.1-kb transcript in a number of human
tissues, with the highest levels in heart and skeletal muscle.

By degenerate PCR, Lee et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA encoding a PRKM
which they named BMK1. BMK1 shows 98% amino acid identity to ERK5; they
differ in a short span of residues at the N terminus. Lee et al. (1995)
speculated that these kinases are derived from the same gene, possibly
via differential mRNA splicing.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Purandare et al. (1998)
mapped the MAPK7 gene to human chromosome 17p11.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Thymocyte emigration after positive selection requires KLF2 (602016)
expression. Although KLF2 expression by endothelial cells requires ERK5,
which is phosphorylated in response to IL7 (146660), Weinreich et al.
(2011) found that Erk5-deficient mouse T cells underwent normal
development and had no Klf2 deficiency. They concluded that IL7 and ERK5
do not control KLF2 or the semimature to mature single-positive
thymocyte transition.

ANIMAL MODEL

To assess the biologic role of MAPK7 (called ERK5 by them), Regan et al.
(2002) deleted the gene in mice. Inactivation of the gene resulted in
defective blood vessel and cardiac development leading to embryonic
lethality around embryonic day 9.5 to 10.5. Cardiac development was
retarded, and the heart failed to undergo normal looping. Endothelial
cells that line the developing myocardium of erk5 -/- embryos displayed
a disorganized, rounded morphology. Vasculogenesis occurred, but
extraembryonic and embryonic blood vessels were disorganized and failed
to mature. Furthermore, the investment of embryonic blood vessels with
smooth muscle cells was attenuated.

Hayashi et al. (2004) found that targeted ablation of MAPK7 using the
Mx1-Cre transgene in adult mice led to lethality within 2 to 4 weeks
after the induction of Cre recombinase. Physiologic analysis showed that
blood vessels became abnormally leaky after deletion of the MAPK7 gene;
histologically, the endothelial cells lining the leaky blood vessels
were round, irregularly aligned, and ultimately apoptotic. In vitro
removal of MAPK7 also led to the death of endothelial cells, partially
due to the downregulation of transcriptional factor MEF2C (600662),
which is a direct substrate of MAPK7. In addition, endothelial-specific
Mapk7 knockout led to cardiovascular defects identical to that of global
Mapk7 -/- mice, but mice lacking Mapk7 only in cardiomyocytes developed
to term with no apparent defects. Hayashi et al. (2004) concluded that
the MAPK7 pathway is critical for endothelial function and maintenance
of blood vessel integrity.

143023	TITLE *143023 RAS ASSOCIATION DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 7; RASSF7
;;CHROMOSOME 11 OPEN READING FRAME 13; C11ORF13;;
HRAS1-RELATED CLUSTER 1; HRC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Weitzel et al. (1992) cloned RASSF7, which they called HRC1. An HRC1
cDNA probe recognized fragments on Southern blots of DNA from other
vertebrate species. In human DNA, multiple homologous fragments were
detected in addition to the predicted ones containing HRC1. HRC1
expression was upregulated with HRAS1 in a bladder carcinoma cell line,
suggesting coordinate regulation. The deduced 373-amino acid protein
contains regions rich in glutamine and proline and a region similar to
the helix-loop-helix motif adjacent to a C-terminal leucine zipper
dimerization motif with 4 heptad repeats.

GENE FUNCTION

Sherwood et al. (2008) found that Xenopus Rassf7 was expressed in
several embryonic tissues, including skin, eye, and neural tube, and
localized to centrosomes in a microtubule-dependent manner. Knockdown of
Rassf7 in Xenopus embryos caused mitotic spindle failure, arrest in
mitosis, nuclear breakdown, apoptosis, and loss of tissue architecture
in neural tube.

MAPPING

Weitzel et al. (1992) characterized a 55-kb region of DNA surrounding
HRAS1 (190020) on chromosome 11. They found that it contains a cluster
of 2, and possibly 3, genes associated with CpG islands within the 32 kb
immediately upstream of HRAS1. One of these loci, located 29 kb upstream
of HRAS1 and provisionally designated HRC1, is divergently transcribed.

;;ILEAL DIPEPTIDYLPEPTIDASE;;
I100, RAT, HOMOLOG OF;;
NAALADase L
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Shneider et al. (1997) purified a novel ileal brush border membrane
protein, which they termed I100, by affinity chromatography. They used
polyclonal antibodies raised against this protein to clone and
characterize I100 in rats. They also identified a partial human I100
cDNA by hybridization screening. The rat I100 cDNA sequence encodes a
predicted 746-amino acid polypeptide with a single membrane-spanning
domain at the N terminus. The I100 protein is glycosylated and has a
core molecular weight of 80 kD. It has homology to folate hydrolase
(600934) and dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP4; 102720). Immunofluorescent
staining revealed that the I100 protein is localized to the brush border
membrane of ileal villus enterocytes. Northern blot analysis of rat and
human tissues detected an approximately 2.6-kb mRNA in ileum, but not in
any other tissues.

By searching databases for sequences similar to NAALADase I (NAALAD1, or
FOLH1; 600934), followed by PCR and 5-prime RACE of a human small
intestine cDNA library, Pangalos et al. (1999) cloned NAALADL1. The
deduced 740-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 80.6
kD. NAALADL1 contains an N-terminal transmembrane domain, 2 putative
catalytic domains, and 7 potential N-glycosylation sites. The first
catalytic domain is similar to bacterial and yeast Zn(2+)-dependent
peptidase domains, and the second is related to members of the
alpha/beta-hydrolase fold family of proteins. NAALADL1 shares 35% and
37% amino acid identity with NAALADase I and NAALADase II (NAALAD2;
611636), respectively. Several NAALADL1 splice variants were also
identified in small intestine, colon, and adult and fetal brain cDNA
libraries. RT-PCR detected variable NAALADL1 expression, with highest
levels in small intestine, spleen, and testis, and lowest levels in
brain and muscle. NAALADL1 was also expressed in some subregions of
adult brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Shneider et al. (1997) found that cells transfected with rat I100 cDNA
had peptidase activity on a gly-pro dipeptide.

By assaying cellular homogenates of transfected COS cells, Pangalos et
al. (1999) showed that human NAALADL1 had DPP4-like activity against a
synthetic peptide, but it lacked NAALADase activity against radiolabeled
N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamate.

MAPPING

By FISH, Pangalos et al. (1999) mapped the NAALADL1 gene to chromosome
11q12.

;;IGFBP, SOLUBLE;;
ACID-LABILE SUBUNIT; ALS
ACID-LABILE SUBUNIT DEFICIENCY, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In vivo, insulin-like growth factors I (IGF1; 147440) and II (IGF2;
147470) are always complexed to one of a family of 6 IGF-binding
proteins, IGFBP1 (146730), IGFBP2 (146731), IGFBP3 (146732), IGFBP4
(146733), IGFBP5 (146734), and IGFBP6 (146735). Until birth, binary
IGFBP/IGF complexes of 50 kD predominate in serum, with IGFBP2 being the
most frequently occurring IGFBP moiety. In juvenile and adult mammals,
however, 80% to 85% of serum IGFs are found in a ternary complex of 150
kD composed of 1 molecule each of IGF, IGFBP3, and a protein that is
found only in serum, the acid-labile subunit (ALS). ALS migrates at an
apparent molecular mass of 84-86 kD. ALS retains the IGFBP3/IGF
complexes in the vascular compartment and extends the half-life of IGFs
in the circulation. Synthesis of ALS occurs mainly in liver after birth
and is stimulated by growth hormone (139250) (summary by Boisclair et
al., 1996).

CLONING

Dai and Baxter (1992) and Baxter and Dai (1994) studied the acid-labile
subunit of the rat IGF binding protein complex. Boisclair et al. (1996)
cloned and characterized the mouse Igfals gene.

Leong et al. (1992) isolated full-length clones encoding the acid-labile
subunit of the IGF binding protein complex from human liver cDNA
libraries by using probes based on amino acid sequence data from the
purified protein. These clones encode a mature protein of 578 amino
acids preceded by a 27-amino acid hydrophobic sequence indicative of a
secretion signal. Expression of the cDNA clones in mammalian tissue
culture cells resulted in the secretion into the culture media of ALS
activity that could form the expected complex with IGF1 and IGFBP3. The
amino acid sequence of ALS is largely composed of 18 to 20 leucine-rich
repeats of 24 amino acids. These repeats are found in a number of
diverse proteins that, like ALS, participate in protein-protein
interactions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Boisclair et al. (1996) found that the mouse Igfals gene contains 2
exons. Domene et al. (2004) stated that the human IGFALS gene contains 2
exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the IGFALS
gene to chromosome 16 (TMAP WI-7742).

Boisclair et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Igfals gene to chromosome 17 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Domene et al. (2004) described a 17-year-old boy who had delayed onset
of puberty, slow pubertal progress, and only minimal slowing of linear
growth in association with inactivation of the IGFALS gene caused by a
homozygous mutation (601489.0001).

ANIMAL MODEL

To evaluate the importance of IGFALS and ternary complexes, Ueki et al.
(2000) generated mice in which the Igfals gene had been inactivated. The
mutation was inherited in a mendelian manner, without any effects on
survival rates and birth weights. A growth deficit was observed in null
mice after 3 weeks of age and reached 13% by 10 weeks. This modest
phenotype was observed despite reductions of 62% and 88% in the
concentrations of plasma IGF1 and IGFBP-3, respectively. Increased
turnover accounted for these reductions because indices of synthesis in
liver and kidney were not decreased. Surprisingly, absence of Igfals did
not affect glucose and insulin homeostasis. Therefore, Igfals is
required for postnatal accumulation of IGF1 and IGFBP3 but, consistent
with findings supporting a predominant role for locally produced IGF1,
is not critical for growth.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ACID-LABILE SUBUNIT DEFICIENCY
IGFALS, 1-BP DEL, 1338G

Domene et al. (2004) described a 17-year-old boy with delayed onset of
puberty and slow pubertal progress. Childhood medical history was
unremarkable, and psychomotor and neurologic development were normal. He
was first referred at 14 years of age for evaluation of growth pubertal
delay, at which time his height was 145.2 cm (2.05 SD below the mean)
and his weight was 35.9 kg. He was Tanner stage 1 for both sexual
development and pubic hair. Both testes were 3 ml in volume. Bone age
was 12.5 years. Growth hormone responses to provocative tests were
normal, but there was marked reduction of both IGF1 (147440) and IGFBP3
(146732), which remained unchanged after stimulation with growth
hormone. The acid-labile subunit was undetectable in the serum before
and after growth hormone stimulation. Sequencing of exons 1 and 2 of the
IGFALS gene revealed a 1-bp deletion, 1338delG, which involved 1 of 5
consecutive guanines at positions 1334-1338. This frameshift point
mutation resulted in the substitution of a lysine for a glutamic acid at
codon 35 (E35K) and the appearance of a premature stop codon at position
120 of the precursor form of the acid-labile subunit. The patient was
thought to be homozygous for the mutation; parental DNA was not
available because the patient had been adopted. After 6 months of
treatment with recombinant human growth hormone, reduction in the
subscapular skinfold thickness was observed but there was no beneficial
effect on either the velocity of growth or the serum levels of IGF1,
IGFBP3, and the acid-labile subunit.

.0002
ACID-LABILE SUBUNIT DEFICIENCY
IGFALS, CYS540ARG

Domene et al. (2007) described a family with 3 affected sibs with
complete acid-labile subunit deficiency. The index case was an
adolescent male with delayed growth and pubertal development (Tanner
stage I, -2.00 standard deviation (SD) score for height at the age of
15.3 years) and poor response to GH (139250) treatment. Complete
sequencing of the IGFALS gene revealed compound heterozygosity for
mutations in exon 2: a 1618C-T transition resulting in a cys540-to-arg
(C540R) substitution on the maternal allele, and a 9-bp duplication on
the paternal allele (601489.0003). The index patient's affected brother
and sister carried the same mutations; a fourth sib carried the
duplication mutation. The 3 affected sibs had marked reduction of IGF1
(147440) and IGFBP3 (146732) levels, undetectable serum levels of
acid-labile subunit, inability to form ternary complexes, and moderate
insulin resistance. All of them attained a normal adult height that was
nonetheless lower than that of their heterozygous brother. The IGF
system was only modestly affected in the heterozygous carriers. Domene
et al. (2007) concluded that haploinsufficiency of the IGFALS gene has
no discernible clinical effects, with only modest impact on the IGF
system.

.0003
ACID-LABILE SUBUNIT DEFICIENCY
IGFALS, 9-BP DUP

The 3 affected sibs with acid-labile subunit deficiency described by
Domene et al. (2007) as well as their unaffected father and brother
carried a 9-bp duplication, 583_591dup9, that predicted the insertion of
3 extra amino acids in the seventh leucine-rich repeat of IGFALS
(S195_197Rdup).

611772	TITLE *611772 NUF2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; NUF2
;;NUF2R;;
CELL DIVISION CYCLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; CDCA1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Wigge and Kilmartin (2001) purified a protein complex from S. cerevisiae
that contained various components of the centromere, including Ndc80
(607272) and Nuf2. By database analysis, they identified human NUF2.
Immunofluorescence studies showed that both NUF2 and NDC80 localized at
the centromeres of mitotic HeLa cells.

Nabetani et al. (2001) cloned human NUF2, which encodes a deduced
464-amino acid coiled-coil protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Nabetani et al. (2001) found that disruption of the Nuf2 gene in S.
pombe resulted in defects in chromosome segregation and the spindle
checkpoint. In particular, the spindles became elongated but without
chromosome segregation. Nabetani et al. (2001) suggested that NUF2
establishes a connection between the spindle and the centromere.

DeLuca et al. (2002) showed that NUF2 specifically functions at
kinetochores and acts to stabilize microtubule attachment in HeLa cells.
Using RNA interference to block NUF2 translation, they found that
spindle formation occurred normally but that kinetochores did not form
attachments to active spindle checkpoints. Depletion of NUF2 also
induced mitotic cells to undergo cell death. DeLuca et al. (2002)
proposed that NUF2 is part of a linker between the kinetochore and
tubulin subunits of the spindle.

Liu et al. (2007) demonstrated that NUF2 binds to the C-terminal domain
of CENPE (117143) and is required for stabilizing CENPE in the
kinetochore. When siRNA blocked NUF2 synthesis, CENPE was no longer
detected in the kinetochore and aberrant chromosome segregation
occurred. Liu et al. (2007) concluded that both proteins are essential
for stable kinetochores and proper chromosome segregation during
mitosis.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nabetani et al. (2001) mapped the NUF2
gene to chromosome 1q23.

300160	TITLE *300160 DEAD/H BOX 3, X-LINKED; DDX3X
;;DDX3;;
DBX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

DEAD box proteins are putative RNA helicases that have a characteristic
asp-glu-ala-asp (DEAD) box as 1 of 8 highly conserved sequence motifs.
Chung et al. (1995) cloned cDNAs encoding DDX3, a member of the DEAD box
protein family.

Lahn and Page (1997) identified DDX3, which they called DBX, as 1 of 5
X-linked genes that have homologs located in the nonrecombining region
of the Y chromosome (NRY). They determined that these 5 X-linked genes
escape X inactivation. Lahn and Page (1997) postulated that these 5
genes are cases in which gene expression is maintained at comparable
levels in males and females by preservation of homologous genes on both
the X and the NRY, with male and female cells expressing both copies of
each gene. Sequence analysis revealed that DBX shares 91% protein
sequence identity with DBY (400010), the Y-linked homolog.

GENE FUNCTION

A single transcript in its unspliced and spliced forms directs synthesis
of all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 proteins. Although nuclear
export of intron-containing cellular transcripts is restricted in
mammalian cells, HIV-1 has evolved the viral Rev protein to overcome
this restriction for viral transcripts. CRM1 (XPO1; 602559) is a
cellular cofactor for Rev-dependent export of intron-containing HIV-1
RNA. Yedavalli et al. (2004) presented evidence that Rev/CRM1 activity
uses the ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX3. They showed that DDX3 is a
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that binds CRM1 and localizes to
nuclear membrane pores. Knockdown of DDX3 using either antisense vector
or dominant-negative mutants suppressed Rev-RRE (Rev response element)
function in the export of incompletely spliced HIV-1 RNAs. Yedavalli et
al. (2004) concluded that DDX3 is the human RNA helicase that functions
in the CRM1 RNA export pathway analogously to the postulated role for
Dbp5 (605812) in yeast mRNA export.

Cruciat et al. (2013) identified the DEAD box RNA helicase DDX3 as a
regulator of the Wnt (see 164820)-beta-catenin (116806) network, where
it acts as a regulatory subunit of CK1-epsilon (600863): in a
Wnt-dependent manner, DDX3 binds CK1-epsilon and directly stimulates its
kinase activity, and promotes phosphorylation of the scaffold protein
dishevelled (see 601365). DDX3 is required for Wnt-beta-catenin
signaling in mammalian cells and during Xenopus and C. elegans
development. Cruciat et al. (2013) concluded that their results
suggested that the kinase-stimulatory function extends to other DDX and
CK1 members.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Park et al. (1998) mapped the
DDX3X gene to Xp11.3-p11.23.

608288	TITLE *608288 INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR 2 mRNA-BINDING PROTEIN 1; IGF2BP1
;;IGF2 mRNA-BINDING PROTEIN 1; IMP1;;
CODING REGION DETERMINANT-BINDING PROTEIN, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; CRDBP;;
ZIPCODE-BINDING PROTEIN 1; ZBP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nielsen et al. (1999) purified several IMP proteins from the
rhabdomyosarcoma (268210) cell line RD that bound to the leader 3 mRNA
in the 5-prime untranslated region of IGF2 (147470). Using degenerate
primers designed from tryptic fragments of IMP1 for RT-PCR of total RD
mRNA, followed by screening an EST database, they cloned IMP1. The
deduced 577-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 63 kD.
IMP1 contains 6 characteristic RNA-binding modules, including 2
N-terminal RRM domains and 4 central and C-terminal KH domains. It
shares 59% amino acid identity with IMP2 (IGF2BP2; 608289) and IMP3
(IGF2BP3; 608259), 95% identity with chicken zipcode-binding protein,
and 99% identity with mouse Crdbp. Immunocytochemical analysis of
cultured cells showed a dynamic subcellular localization for IMP1 that
was dependent upon the cell type, the degree of cell differentiation,
and exposure of the cells to serum factors that differ between newborn
and fetal calf serum. Northern blot analysis detected no expression of
Imp1, Imp2, or Imp3 in adult mouse tissues. However, analysis of mouse
embryos showed that expression of all 3 Imp transcripts peaked at
embryonic day 12.5 and declined toward birth. RNA dot blot analysis
detected moderate IMP1 expression in placenta and in all human fetal
tissues of mixed first-trimester age examined. Immunohistochemical
staining of developing human skeletal muscle cells showed IMP1 beneath
the plasma membrane along the circumference of myoblasts and myotubes.
IMP1 was also detected in trophoblasts of human term placenta.
Immunostaining of frozen mouse embryos detected expression of Imp1 at
the basal plasma cell membrane of developing epidermis, in epithelia of
the lung and intestines, and in skeletal muscle throughout development.

GENE FUNCTION

By mobility shift analysis, Nielsen et al. (1999) determined that IGF2
leader 3 mRNA contains at least 6 binding sites for IMP1; no binding
sites were found on IGF2 leader 4 mRNA. IMP1 competed with PTB (600693)
for IGF2 leader 3 mRNA binding in a Mg(2+)-dependent manner, and binding
was mutually exclusive. PTB was the predominant species at low Mg(2+)
concentrations, while IMP1 was predominant at higher Mg(2+)
concentrations. IMP1 inhibited translation from a leader 3 reporter mRNA
in vivo.

By FISH, Doyle et al. (2000) determined that the CRDBP gene was
magnified in 14 of 40 breast cancer samples, and the amplification was
found only in the tumor cells in each sample. In 7 of these 14 cases,
the HER2 gene (164870) was coamplified.

By RT-PCR, Ioannidis et al. (2003) detected expression of CRDBP in 69 of
118 (58.5%) primary breast tumors, but not in any normal breast tissue
examined. There was no significant association between CRDBP expression
and patient age, histologic tumor type, tumor size, nodal status, or
invasion. However, there was a borderline association between CRDBP
expression and advanced tumor grade (grade I/II vs grade III, p of
0.054), and a highly significant inverse association between CRDBP
expression and estrogen receptor (see 133430) expression (p of 0.005).
Copy number gains in the region encompassing the CRDBP gene were found
in 11 of 60 (18.3%) tumor samples, but 3 of these samples were negative
for CRDBP expression.

Localization of beta-actin (102630) mRNA to sites of active actin
polymerization modulates cell migration during embryogenesis,
differentiation, and possibly carcinogenesis. This localization requires
the oncofetal protein ZBP1, which binds to a conserved 54-nucleotide
element in the 3-prime untranslated region of the beta-actin mRNA known
as the 'zipcode.' ZBP1 promotes translocation of the beta-actin
transcript to actin-rich protrusions in primary fibroblasts and neurons.
Huttelmaier et al. (2005) showed that chicken ZBP1 modulates the
translation of beta-actin mRNA. ZBP1 associates with the beta-actin
transcript in the nucleus and prevents premature translation in the
cytoplasm by blocking translation initiation. Translation occurs only
when the ZBP1-RNA complex reaches its destination at the periphery of
the cell. At the endpoint of mRNA transport, the protein kinase Src
(190090) promotes translation by phosphorylating a key tyrosine residue
in ZBP1 that is required for binding to RNA. These sequential events
provide both temporal and spatial control over beta-actin mRNA
translation, which is important for cell migration and neurite
outgrowth.

Noubissi et al. (2006) demonstrated that beta-catenin (see 116806)
stabilizes the mRNA encoding the F-box protein beta-TrCP1 (BTRCP1;
603482), and identified the RNA-binding protein CRDBP as a target of
beta catenin/Tcf transcription factor. CRDBP binds to the coding region
of BTRCP1 mRNA. Overexpression of CRDBP stabilized BTRCP1 mRNA and
elevated BTRCP1 levels both in cells and in vivo, resulting in the
activation of the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein (SCF)-BTRCP1 E3 ubiquitin
ligase and in accelerated turnover of its substrates including I-kappa-B
(see 164008) and beta-catenin. CRDBP is essential for the induction of
both BTRCP1 and c-Myc (190080) by beta-catenin signaling in colorectal
cancer cells. Noubissi et al. (2006) concluded that high levels of CRDBP
that are found in primary human colorectal tumors exhibiting active
beta-catenin/Tcf signaling implicates CRDBP induction in the
upregulation of BTRCP1, in the activation of dimeric transcription
factor NF-kappa-B (see 164011), and in the suppression of apoptosis in
these cancers.

GENE STRUCTURE

Doyle et al. (2000) determined that the mouse Crdbp gene contains 15
exons and spans about 40 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Doyle et al. (2000) mapped the CRDBP (IGF2BP1) gene to
chromosome 17q21.3. It lies distal to the HER2 and RARA (180240) genes
and proximal to the MPO gene (606989). Doyle et al. (2000) mapped the
mouse Crdbp gene to chromosome 11.

600516	TITLE *600516 BCL2 ANTAGONIST KILLER 1; BAK1
;;BAK;;
BCL2L7
BAK-LIKE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The BCL2 oncogene (151430), which is activated in follicular lymphomas,
functions as a potent suppressor of apoptosis under diverse conditions.
Chittenden et al. (1995) and Kiefer et al. (1995) described the cDNA
cloning of a novel BCL2 homolog, BAK.

Kim et al. (2004) identified a 101-amino acid splice variant of BAK1,
which they called BAK-like, that contains BH1, BH2, and TM domains, but
lacks a BH3 domain. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.4-kb transcript
in most human tissues and cell lines examined. Confocal microscopy
studies localized the variant to a diffuse cytosolic pattern that
redistributed to a mitochondrial staining pattern upon apoptosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Herberg et al. (1998) found that the BAK1 gene spans 7.6 kb and contains
6 exons. The first exon is noncoding, and most of the largest, final
exon is untranslated.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids, Kiefer et al. (1995) localized the BAK gene to chromosome 6.
Ulrich et al. (1997) mapped the mouse homolog of BAK1 to chromosome 17
in region B by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Because of the
location of the bak gene on mouse chromosome 17, the human BAK1 gene was
expected to be located on 6p. By FISH, Herberg et al. (1998) mapped the
BAK1 gene to 6p21.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Chittenden et al. (1995) and Kiefer et al. (1995) described the
functional analysis of BAK, which promotes cell death and counteracts
the protection from apoptosis provided by BCL2. Chittenden et al. (1995)
found that enforced expression of BAK induced rapid and extensive
apoptosis of serum-deprived fibroblasts. This suggested that BAK may be
directly involved in activating the cell death machinery. Kiefer et al.
(1995) pointed out that, like BAX (600040), the BAK gene product
primarily enhances apoptotic cell death following an appropriate
stimulus. Unlike BAX, however, BAK can inhibit cell death in an
Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cell line.

During transduction of an apoptotic signal into the cell, there is an
alteration in the permeability of the membranes of the cell's
mitochondria, which causes the translocation of the apoptogenic protein
cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, which in turn activates death-driving
proteolytic proteins known as caspases (see 147678). The BCL2 family of
proteins, whose members may be antiapoptotic or proapoptotic, regulates
cell death by controlling this mitochondrial membrane permeability
during apoptosis. Shimizu et al. (1999) created liposomes that carried
the mitochondrial porin channel VDAC (604492) to show that the
recombinant proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak accelerate the opening of
VDAC, whereas the antiapoptotic protein BCLXL (600039) closes VDAC by
binding to it directly. Bax and Bak allow cytochrome c to pass through
VDAC out of liposomes, but passage is prevented by BCLXL. In agreement
with this, VDAC1-deficient mitochondria from a mutant yeast did not
exhibit a Bax/Bak-induced loss in membrane potential and cytochrome c
release, both of which were inhibited by BCLXL. Shimizu et al. (1999)
concluded that the BCL2 family of proteins bind to the VDAC in order to
regulate the mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of
cytochrome c during apoptosis.

The caspase-activated form of BID (601997), tBID, triggers the
homooligomerization of multidomain conserved proapoptotic family members
BAK or BAX, resulting in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria.
Wei et al. (2001) found that cells lacking both BAK and BAX, but not
cells lacking only one of these components, are completely resistant to
tBID-induced cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Moreover, doubly
deficient cells are resistant to multiple apoptotic stimuli that act
through disruption of mitochondrial function: staurosporine, ultraviolet
radiation, growth factor deprivation, etoposide, and the endoplasmic
reticulum stress stimuli thapsigargin and tunicamycin. Thus, Wei et al.
(2001) concluded that activation of a 'multidomain' proapoptotic member,
BAK or BAX, appears to be an essential gateway to mitochondrial
dysfunction required for cell death in response to diverse stimuli.

Cheng et al. (2003) found that in viable cells, BAK complexed with the
mitochondrial outer membrane protein VDAC2 (193245), a VDAC isoform
present in low abundance that interacts specifically with the inactive
conformer of BAK. Cells deficient in VDAC2, but not cells lacking the
more abundant VDAC1, exhibited enhanced BAK oligomerization and were
more susceptible to apoptotic death. Conversely, overexpression of VDAC2
selectively prevented BAK activation and inhibited the mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway. Death signals activate 'BH3-only' molecules such as
tBID, BIM (603827), or BAD (603167), which displace VDAC2 from BAK,
enabling homooligomerization of BAK and apoptosis. Thus, Cheng et al.
(2003) concluded that VDAC2, an isoform restricted to mammals, regulates
the activity of BAK and provides a connection between mitochondrial
physiology and the core apoptotic pathway.

Fannjiang et al. (2003) examined the ability of Bak1-null and
Bak1-overexpressing mice to resist various neuronal injuries, including
neuronotropic Sindbis virus infection, Parkinson disease,
ischemia/stroke, and seizure. The results showed that Bak1 could promote
or inhibit neuronal death depending on the specific death stimulus and
the maturity of the animal. Bak1 protected immature mice and neurons
from Sindbis virus and excitotoxic stimuli. Deletion of the hydrophobic
C terminus converted Bak1 from an antiapoptotic to a proapoptotic
protein. In older mice, Bak1 could be anti- or proapoptotic depending on
the neuronal subtype and the neuronal injury. Bak1 protected older mice
from excitotoxic cell death and seizure, but it promoted Sindbis virus
toxicity. Bak1-deficient adult mice showed enhanced sensitivity to
kainate-induced seizures, and this increased sensitivity was associated
with reduced neurotransmitter release from inhibitory GABAergic nerve
terminals and increased release from excitatory glutamatergic neurons,
indicating that BAK1 modifies synaptic activity of hippocampal neurons.

The p53 protein (191170) is an important proapoptotic regulator. Leu et
al. (2004) found that after cell stress, p53 interacted with BAK. This
interaction caused oligomerization of BAK and release of cytochrome c
from mitochondria. Formation of the p53-BAK complex coincided with loss
of an interaction between BAK and the antiapoptotic protein MCL1
(159552). Leu et al. (2004) suggested that p53 and MCL1 have opposing
effects on mitochondrial apoptosis by modulating BAK activity.

Hetz et al. (2006) investigated the unfolded protein response signaling
events in mice in the absence of proapoptotic BCL2 family members Bax
(600040) and Bak using double-knockout mice. Double-knockout mice
responded abnormally to tunicamycin-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress in the liver, with extensive tissue damage and decreased
expression of the IRE1 substrate X box-binding protein-1 (XBP1; 194355)
and its target genes. ER-stressed double-knockout cells showed deficient
Ire1-alpha (604033) signaling. Bax and Bak formed a protein complex with
the cytosolic domain of Ire1-alpha that was essential for Ire1-alpha
activation. Thus, Hetz et al. (2006) concluded that BAX and BAK function
at the ER membrane to activate IRE1-alpha signaling and to provide a
physical link between members of the core apoptotic pathway and the
unfolded protein response.

Two members of the BCL2 family, BAX and BAK, change intracellular
location early in the promotion of apoptosis to concentrate in focal
clusters at sites of mitochondrial division. Karbowski et al. (2006)
reported that in healthy cells, BAX or BAK is required for normal fusion
of mitochondria into elongated tubules. BAX seems to induce
mitochondrial fusion by activating assembly of the large GTPase MFN2
(608507) and changing its submitochondrial distribution and membrane
mobility--properties that correlate with different GTP-bound states of
MFN2. Karbowski et al. (2006) concluded that BAX and BAK regulate
mitochondrial dynamics in healthy cells and that BCL2 family members may
also regulate apoptosis through organelle morphogenesis machineries.

A central issue in the regulation of apoptosis by the BCL2 family is
whether its BH3-only members initiate apoptosis by directly binding to
the essential cell death mediators BAX and BAK, or whether they can act
indirectly, by engaging their prosurvival BCL2-like relatives. Contrary
to the direct-activation model, Willis et al. (2007) showed that BAX and
BAK can mediate apoptosis without discernable association with the
putative BH3-only activators (BIM, 603827; BID, 601997; and PUMA,
605854), even in cells with no BIM or BID and reduced PUMA. Willis et
al. (2007) concluded that BH3-only proteins induce apoptosis at least
primarily by engaging with multiple prosurvival relatives guarding BAX
and BAK.

Liver is generally refractory to apoptosis induced by p53. Leu and
George (2007) found that p53 activation led to enhanced expression of
IGFBP1 (146730) in human hepatoma cells. A portion of intracellular
IGFBP1 localized to mitochondria, where it bound the proapoptotic
protein BAK. Binding of IGFBP1 to BAK impaired formation of the
proapoptotic p53/BAK complex and induction of apoptosis in cultured
human and mouse cells and in mouse liver. In contrast, livers of
Igfbp1-deficient mice exhibited spontaneous apoptosis accompanied by p53
mitochondrial accumulation and evidence of Bak oligomerization. Leu and
George (2007) concluded that IGFBP1 is a negative regulator of the
p53/BAK-dependent pathway of apoptosis.

BHRF1 is a prosurvival molecule from Epstein-Barr virus that is
homologous to BCL2. Desbien et al. (2009) showed that, in mouse T cells,
BHRF1 bound Bak, and that in cell cultures without cytokines, BHRF1
associated with Bim. BHRF1 with a point mutation in its BH3-binding
groove that eliminated binding to Bak retained its ability to bind Bim
and to protect cells. Desbien et al. (2009) concluded that binding of
BHRF1 to BIM, rather than BAK, provides protection.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the BAK1
gene and testicular germ cell tumors, see 273300.

ANIMAL MODEL

Proapoptotic Bcl2 family members have been proposed to play a central
role in regulating apoptosis, yet mice lacking Bax display limited
phenotypic abnormalities. Lindsten et al. (2000) found that Bak -/- mice
were developmentally normal and reproductively fit and failed to develop
any age-related disorders. However, when Bak-deficient mice were mated
to Bax-deficient mice to create mice lacking both genes, the majority of
Bax-/- Bak-/- animals died perinatally, with fewer than 10% surviving
into adulthood. Bax-/- Bak-/- mice displayed multiple developmental
defects, including persistence of interdigital webs, an imperforate
vaginal canal, and accumulation of excess cells within both the central
nervous and hematopoietic systems. Thus, the authors concluded that Bax
and Bak have overlapping roles in the regulation of apoptosis during
mammalian development and tissue homeostasis.

Scorrano et al. (2003) found that mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient
for Bax (600040) and Bak had a reduced resting concentration of calcium
in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that resulted in decreased uptake of
calcium by mitochondria after calcium release from the ER. Expression of
SERCA (sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium adenosine
triphosphatase; see 108740) corrected ER calcium concentration and
mitochondrial calcium uptake in double knockout cells, restoring
apoptotic death in response to agents that release calcium from
intracellular stores, such as arachidonic acid, C2-ceramide, and
oxidative stress. In contrast, targeting of Bax to mitochondria
selectively restored apoptosis to 'BH3-only' signals. A third set of
stimuli, including many intrinsic signals, required both ER-released
calcium and the presence of mitochondrial Bax or Bak to fully restore
apoptosis. Scorrano et al. (2003) concluded that BAX and BAK operate in
both the ER and the mitochondria as an essential gateway for selected
apoptotic signals.

Takeuchi et al. (2005) generated mice conditionally deficient in both
Bax and Bak in B cells, but not T cells, and compared them with Bim -/-
mice. Deletion of Bak and Bax in B cells caused accumulation of immature
and mature follicular B cells and abrogation of apoptosis, whereas Bim
deficiency caused accumulation of mature splenic B cells only and
partial resistance to apoptosis. B cells from the Bax- and Bak-deficient
mice were also defective in cell cycling in response to B-cell receptor
crosslinking and lipopolysaccharide. Induced Bax and Bak deficiency in
adult mice resulted in development of severe autoimmune glomerular
nephritis. Takeuchi et al. (2005) concluded that BAX and BAK are
essential for apoptosis and maintenance of B-cell homeostasis.

The C57BL/6J mouse strain shows a classic pattern of age-related hearing
loss (612448) by 12 to 15 months of age. Someya et al. (2009) found that
mice with deletion in the Bak gene had significantly less age-related
hearing loss compared to wildtype mice. Preservation of hearing was
associated with reduced oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of spiral
ganglion cells and cochlear hair cells. Bax-null mice did not show such
resistance to hearing loss. In vitro studies on primary cochlear cells
showed that oxidative stress was associated with overexpression of Bak
and apoptosis. Oral supplementation of wildtype mice with the
mitochondrial antioxidants alpha-lipoic acid and coenzyme Q10 suppressed
Bak expression in the cochlea, reduced cochlear cell death, and
prevented age-related hearing loss. Someya et al. (2009) suggested that
BAK is required for the development of age-related hearing loss, and
that induction of a BAK-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis program in
response to oxidative stress is a key pathogenic mechanism.

Ren et al. (2010) provided in vivo evidence demonstrating an essential
role of the proteins BID (601997), BIM (603827), and PUMA (605854) in
activating BAX and BAK. Bid, Bim, and Puma triple-knockout mice showed
the same developmental defects that are associated with deficiency of
Bax and Bak, including persistent interdigital webs and imperforate
vaginas. Genetic deletion of Bid, Bim, and Puma prevented the
homooligomerization of Bax and Bak, and thereby cytochrome c
(123970)-mediated activation of caspases in response to diverse death
signals in neurons and T lymphocytes, despite the presence of other
BH3-only molecules. Thus, Ren et al. (2010) concluded that many forms of
apoptosis require direct activation of BAX and BAK at the mitochondria
by a member of the BID, BIM, or PUMA family of proteins.

RH-NULL DISEASE, AMORPH TYPE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION Rh, elliptocytosis, PGM1, and 6PGD are all on the same chromosome. The
first 2 loci appear to lie between the latter 2 (Renwick, 1971).
Information from cell hybridization studies placed the
Rh-elliptocytosis-PGM(1)-6PGD linkage group on chromosome 1. Jacobs et
al. (1970) reported data suggesting a loose linkage between a
translocation breakpoint near the end of the long arm of chromosome 1
and Rh. Lamm et al. (1970) published family data consistent with loose
linkage of Duffy and PGM1. Renwick (1971) suggested that PGM1 is on the
side of Rh, remote from 6PGD and about 30 centimorgans from Rh. Cook et
al. (1972) confirmed this interval. Although the Rh and Duffy loci are
both on chromosome 1, they are too far apart to demonstrate linkage in
family studies (Sanger et al., 1973). Marsh et al. (1974) found
Rh-negative erythrocytes in an Rh-positive man suffering from
myelofibrosis. Nucleated hemopoietic precursors were circulating in his
blood, and these cells had an abnormal chromosome complement from which
part of the short arm of chromosome 1 had been deleted. They concluded
that the Rh locus probably lies on the distal segment of the short arm
at some point between 1p32 and the end of the short arm. The conclusion
is consistent with the finding of Douglas et al. (1973) that the PGM1
locus, which is linked to Rh, is on the short arm of chromosome 1. Since
the patient of Marsh et al. (1974) did not have deletion of the PGM1
locus in the mutant clone, the Rh locus is probably distal to the PGM1
locus. Corney et al. (1977) observed only 1 recombination in 58
opportunities between the alpha-fucosidase locus (FUCA1; 612280) and the
Rh locus. Rh antigen still eludes chemical definition (Tippett, 1978),
but it is thought to be a lipoprotein. No completely certain example of
recombination within a postulated gene complex has been described.
Steinberg (1965) described a Hutterite family in which the father was
CDe-cde, mother cde-cde, 4 children cde-cde, 3 children CDe-cde, and 1
child (the 6th born) Cde-cde. Steinberg (1965) thought this was an
instance of crossing-over. Mutation and, much less likely, a recessive
suppressor of the D antigen were mentioned as other possibilities. Race
and Sanger (1975) considered a recessive suppressor likely.
(Illegitimacy was excluded by the mores of the sect and by marker
studies.) Rosenfield (1981) wrote: 'We still know nothing about Rh.
Except for Steinberg's one crossover, there have been no exceptions to
the inheritance of Rh antigens in tight haplotype packages. Hopefully,
Rh antigen will be isolated for characterisation but there has been
nothing published since the report of Plapp et al. (1979).' Steinberg et
al. (1984) reexamined the Hutterite family, making use of other markers
thought to be on 1p (6PGD, Colton, UMPK1) and concluded that crossover
or mutation indeed had occurred. (Colton is probably not on chromosome
1p; UMPK1 was not informative in the critical parent (Lewis, 1989).)
They concluded further that if, as seems likely from other evidence, C
lies between D and E, their data indicate that the D gene (116800) is
distal (telomeric) in the Rh complex. This order is consistent with the
rare Rh haplotype D. Race et al. (1950, 1951) considered this haplotype
to represent a probable or possible deletion in a human Rh chromosome.
Race and Sanger (1975) listed 20 homozygotes for this haplotype.
Originating from various populations, they were, in about 80% of the
cases, the products of consanguineous matings. Olafsdottir et al. (1983)
concluded that this Rhesus haplotype is not very rare in Iceland. They
estimated the frequency to be about 1 in 214 persons. They discovered
the haplotype in 2 unrelated women because of difficulty with
crossmatching. Both had formed Rh antibodies, one provoked by
transfusions and the other by 3 pregnancies.

Saboori et al. (1988) purified Rh protein in relatively large amounts
from Rh(D)-positive and -negative blood. Differences in the peptide maps
of the 2 proteins were found. Blanchard et al. (1988) presented indirect
data based on immunologic and biochemical investigations demonstrating
that the Rh D, c, and E polypeptides of the erythrocyte membrane are
homologous but distinct molecular species that can be physically
separated and analyzed. These polypeptides have a molecular weight of
about 32,000. Polypeptides c and E were found by Blanchard et al. (1988)
to be more closely related to each other than to D. All the observations
were consistent with partial divergence among homologous members of a
family of Rh proteins. In a review completed in early 1988, Issitt
(1988) suggested that current molecular genetic methods could finally
end 50 years of speculation as to the genetic determination of the Rh
blood groups. Cherif-Zahar et al. (1990) isolated cDNA clones encoding a
human blood group Rh polypeptide from a human bone marrow cDNA library
using a PCR amplified DNA fragment encoding the known common N-terminal
region of the Rh proteins. Translation of the open reading frame
indicated that the Rh protein is composed of 417 amino acids, including
the initiator methionine, which is removed in the mature protein, that
it lacks a cleavable N-terminal sequence, and that it has no consensus
site for potential N-glycosylation. Hydropathy analysis and predictions
of secondary structure suggested the presence of 13 membrane-spanning
domains, indicating that the Rh polypeptide is highly hydrophobic and
deeply buried within the phospholipid bilayer. In Northern analysis, the
Rh cDNA probe detected a major 1.7-kb and a minor 3.5-kb mRNA species in
erythroid tissues but not in adult liver and kidney tissues or lymphoid
and promyelocytic cell lines. By in situ hybridization using an Rh
protein probe, Cherif-Zahar et al. (1991) mapped the Rh gene to
1p36.1-p34.3.

Whether the 3 sets of Rh antigens--D, Cc, and Ee--that are inherited en
bloc represent separate epitopes on a single protein (as maintained by
Wiener, 1944) or multiple independent proteins encoded by closely linked
genes (as first suggested by Fisher in 1944 (Race, 1944)) has been
controversial since the discovery of the Rh antigens in the early 1940s.
Cherif-Zahar et al. (1990) quoted work of Blanchard et al. (1988)
suggesting that the Rh D, c, and E antigens are carried by 3 distinct
but homologous membrane proteins that share a common N-terminal protein
sequence. It is possible that these are the product of one gene with
multiple splicing alternatives. See also review by Agre and Cartron
(1991). Colin et al. (1991) used Rh cDNA as a probe in Southern analysis
of the Rh locus. They demonstrated that in all Rh D-positive persons 2
strongly related Rh genes are present per haploid genome, whereas 1 of
these 2 genes is missing in Rh D-negative donors. Colin et al. (1991)
concluded that 1 of the 2 genes of the Rh locus encodes the Rh C/c and
Rh E/e polypeptides while the other encodes the Rh D protein. (Both
Fisher and Wiener were partly right.) The absence of any D gene and of
its postulated allelic form d in the Rh D-negative genome explains why
no Rh d antigen has ever been demonstrated.

Using cDNAs amplified from reticulocyte mRNA, Mouro et al. (1993)
investigated CcEe gene differences in Rh-negative individuals homozygous
for dCe, dcE, and dce haplotypes. The RNA analysis was followed by PCR
amplification of specific exons using genomic DNA from donors carrying a
range of common Rh haplotypes. The Ee polypeptide was shown to be
synthesized from the full-length transcript of the CcEe gene and to be
identical in length (417 residues) and very similar in sequence to the D
polypeptide. The Cc polypeptides were synthesized from shorter
transcripts of the same CcEe gene sequence, but spliced so as to exclude
exons 4, 5, and 6 or exons 4, 5 and 8. In both cases, the residue at 226
in exon 5 associated with Ee antigenicity was omitted from the
polypeptide product; see 111700.0001 and 111700.0002. Also see review by
Hopkinson (1993).

The Rh-null phenotype is of 2 types. The most common type, called the
'regulator type,' occurs by an inhibition mechanism; see 268150. This
form is caused by homozygosity for an autosomal recessive suppressor
gene that is genetically independent of the Rh locus, mapping to
chromosome 3 rather than to chromosome 1. The second type of Rh-null,
which was first described in a Japanese family (Ishimori and Hasekura,
1967), is called the 'amorph type' and results from homozygosity for a
silent allele at the Rh locus. In a survey of 42 examples of the Rh-null
phenotype, Nash and Shojania (1987) found that only 5 were of the amorph
type. Perez-Perez et al. (1992) described a Spanish family in which a
silent Rh gene was segregating, giving rise to the amorph type of
Rh-null in the proposita whose parents were first cousins. She suffered
from severe hemolytic anemia. Western blot analysis carried out with
glycosylation-independent antibodies directed against the Rh polypeptide
and the LW glycoprotein, respectively, confirmed that these protein
components were absent from the red cells of the proposita.

Investigations by Cherif-Zahar et al. (1993) failed to reveal any
alteration of the RH genes and transcripts in Rh-null of the silent
type, and they suspected that these variants have a transcriptional or
post-transcriptional alteration of RH genes. Cherif-Zahar et al. (1996)
analyzed the RH locus and sequenced the Rh transcripts from 5
Rh-deficient phenotypes caused by an autosomal suppressor gene (reg and
mod types). They were unable to detect any abnormality; these variants
did not express RH genes but did convey a functional RH locus from one
generation to the next. They also detected no gross alteration in the
CD47 gene structure; transcripts were easily amplified and the
nucleotide sequence was identical to that from controls. This agreed
with binding studies indicating that CD47 is present on the red cell
surface of Rh-deficient cells, although severely reduced (10-15% of
controls). In general, their findings suggested that the low expression
of CD47 on Rh-null erythrocytes results from the defective assembly or
transport to the cell surface when Rh proteins are absent.

Cherif-Zahar et al. (1994) demonstrated that the RHCE gene has 10 exons
distributed over 75 kb. Exons 4 to 8 are alternatively spliced in the
different RNA isoforms. Primary extension analysis indicated that the
transcription initiation site is located 83 bp upstream of the
initiation codon. Study of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic (HeLa)
cell lines and Northern blot analysis suggested that the expression of
the RH locus is restricted to the erythroid/megakaryocytic lineage.
Consistent with this, putative binding sites for SP1, GATA-1, and Ets
proteins, nuclear factors known to be involved in erythroid and
megakaryocytic gene expression, were identified in the promoter of the
RHCE gene.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

Mollison (1994) reviewed the genetic basis of the Rh blood group system,
giving a brief survey of the early history. Rosenfield (1989) had
described the bitter disagreements between Wiener and Levine,
particularly over priority of discovery. Mollison (1994) reviewed the
disagreement between A. S. Wiener, who postulated multiple alleles at a
single locus (Wiener, 1943), and R. A. Fisher, who interpreted the data
of R. R. Race (1944) as most compatible with the existence of 3 closely
linked genes. Cartron and Agre (1993) reviewed the protein and gene
structure of the Rh blood group antigens. In summary, Rh-positive
persons have 2 Rh genes, 1 encoding the Cc- and Ee-bearing protein or,
more likely, proteins, and a second encoding the D-bearing protein,
while Rh-negative persons have only 1 Rh gene, the first of the 2
described above.

Cartron et al. (1995) defended the 2-gene model of the Rh blood group
system. They suggested that the RHCE gene encodes the C/c and E/e
proteins through alternative splicing of the primary transcript.
D-positive and D-negative individuals differ on the basis of the
presence or absence of the RHD gene (111680), as a rule; in some
Australian Aborigines and Blacks, a fragment of the RHD gene or a
nonfunctional RHD gene is present. Smythe et al. (1996) found that both
c and E antigens were expressed after transduction of K562 cells with a
single cDNA, indicating that the c antigen does not arise by alternative
splicing (exon skipping) of the product of the RHCE gene.

Valenzuela et al. (1991) reported a strong association between plasma
total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and Cc Rh specificity in a Chilean
primary school population in Santiago. Valenzuela et al. (1995) found
similar results in university students from Medellin, Colombia.

In a 3-generation family ascertained through the East of Scotland Blood
Transfusion Service in Dundee, Scotland, Huang et al. (1996) found that
a cataract-causing mutation was cosegregating with an autosomal dominant
anomaly of Rh type known as the Evans phenotype. The geography and the
genetic linkage suggested that the form of cataract may be the same as
that in the Danish family. The red cell Evans phenotype is produced by a
hybrid RH gene in which exons 2-6 from the RHD gene is transferred to
the RHCE gene. Kemp et al. (1996) also examined 5 unrelated Rh D--
homozygotes and found that, in 4 of them, RHCE sequences had been
replaced by RHD sequences. The 5-prime end of these rearrangements
occurred within a 4.2-kb interval around exon 2. There was, however,
heterogeneity at the 3-prime end of the rearranged genes, indicating
that they were not identical by descent, but rather that independent
recombination events had occurred within a small genomic interval--a
recombination hotspot.

Fisher and Race (1946) proposed a model for the evolution of the RH
polymorphism in which the less common haplotypes (CDE, Cde, cdE, and
CdE) are generated and maintained by recombination from those found at
higher frequency. The frequency ratios of the supposed parental and
recombinant haplotypes suggested that the arrangement D-C-E was most
likely under the crossing-over hypothesis. At the time, they assumed
that the 3 series of antigens were encoded in 3 separate genes; the work
outlined earlier indicated that there are 2. Thus recombination between
the sites encoding C/c and E/e would be intragenic, and occur between
exons that are separated by approximately 30 kb (Cherif-Zahar et al.,
1994). Carritt et al. (1997) presented direct evidence for nonreciprocal
intergenic exchange (gene conversion) occurring once in human history to
generate the common RHCE allele, Ce. They also used new polymorphisms to
construct haplotypes which suggested that intragenic recombination
played a major role in the generation of the less common haplotypes, but
only if RHD lies 3-prime of RHCE, i.e., the order is C-E-D. They
provided both genetic and physical evidence supporting this arrangement.

The high degree of homology between the coding regions of the RHCE and
RHD genes is consistent with an ancestral gene duplication. Carritt et
al. (1997) concluded that the human lineage started with the haplotype
cDe. This is consistent with its very high incidence in black Africans
and their descendants (0.4 to 0.5, compared to less than 0.1 elsewhere).
The common haplotype underlying the RhD- phenotype (cde) almost
certainly represented a loss of RHD from cDe. This haplotype is entirely
absent from some aboriginal groups, e.g., Australian, Eskimo, and
Navajo. How the RhD- haplotype became established in a predominantly
RhD+ population, given the moderate to strong selection against RHD+/-
heterozygotes imposed by fetomaternal incompatibility, was still
unknown. As first pointed out in 1942 by Haldane (1942) and reexamined
by Hogben (1943), Li (1953), and others, selection against heterozygotes
results in unstable population equilibria. In an extended simulation
study, Feldman et al. (1969) concluded that, while reproductive
compensation on the part of RhD- mothers can, in principle, lead to
stable equilibria in the face of such selection, other forces, for
example, heterozygote advantage, must operate to maintain RhD+:RhD-
ratios at their observed levels.

Suto et al. (2000) analyzed the organization of the RH genes by 2-color
fluorescence in situ hybridization on DNA fibers released from
lymphocytes (fiber-FISH) and by using DNA probes of introns 3 and 7 of
the RHCE and RHD genes. Six Rh-positive samples (2 with the D+C-c+E+e-,
2 with the D+C+c-E-e+, and 2 with the D+C+c+E+e+ phenotype) showed the
presence of 2 RH genes within a region of less than 200 kb. Of great
interest was the finding that the genes were arranged in antidromic
order starting from the telomere: tel--RHCE (5-prime to 3-prime)--RHD
(3-prime to 5-prime)--centromere. On the other hand, 2 typical
Rh-negative samples (D-C-c+E+e+) showed the presence of only 1 RHCE
gene, as expected.

Wagner and Flegel (2000) showed that the RH locus represents a gene
cluster: RHD (111680) and RHCE face each other by their 3-prime tail
ends, and a third gene, SMP1 (605348), is interspersed between the 2
rhesus genes. The RHD gene deletion was parsimoniously explained by an
unequal crossing-over event. The inverse orientation of the RH genes may
facilitate gene conversion among both rhesus genes, which would explain
the high frequency of hybrid alleles.

The duplication of the rhesus gene occurred during primate evolution
(Matassi et al., 1999), giving rise to the RHD and RHCE genes in humans.
Thus nonprimate mammals, such as mice, may reveal the ancient state of
the RH locus. With this in mind, Wagner and Flegel (2002) analyzed the
sequence of the region. Based on the gene positions and orientations,
RHCE was determined to represent the ancestral state. The close
proximity of SMP1 and RH known in humans was also observed in the mouse
RH locus. Wagner and Flegel (2002) concluded that RHD arose by
duplication of RHCE. The orientation of RHD was probably inverted during
this event. The so-called rhesus boxes, two 9,000-bp DNA segments of
identical orientation flanking the RHD gene, may have been instrumental
for the duplication.

Avent and Reid (2000) provided a comprehensive review of the Rh blood
group system.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RH E/e POLYMORPHISM
RHCE, PRO226ALA

Mouro et al. (1993) showed that the difference between the classic
allelic antithetical E and e antigens depends on a point mutation in
exon 5 which changes proline to alanine at residue 226 in the e allele.

.0002
RH C/c POLYMORPHISM
RHCE, CYS16TRP, ILE60LEU, SER68ASN, AND SER103PRO

Mouro et al. (1993) showed that the difference between the classic
allelic antithetical C and c antigens depends on point mutations leading
to 4 amino acid substitutions in exons 1 and 2 in the c allele.

RH-NULL DISEASE, AMORPH TYPE
RHCE, 2-BP DEL, 966T AND 968A

As noted earlier, RH-null disease (which includes the amorphic and
regulator (268150) types) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by
stomatocytosis and chronic hemolytic anemia. Huang et al. (1998) studied
a German family transmitting a putative amorph Rh-null disease gene.
They analyzed the genomic and transcript structure of Rh30, Rh50
(180297), and CD47 (601028), the 3 loci thought to be most critical for
expression of the Rh complex in the red blood cell membrane. They showed
that in this family the Rh50 and CD47 transcripts were normal in primary
sequence. However, the Rh30 locus contained an unusual double mutation
in exon 7 of the RHCE gene, in addition to a deletion of the RhD gene.
The mutation targeted 2 adjacent codons in multiple arrangements,
probably via the mechanism of microgene conversion. One scheme entailed
a noncontiguous deletion of 2 nucleotides, ATT(ile322) to AT and
CAC(his323) to CC, whereas the other involved a T-to-C transition,
ATT(ile322) to ATC, and a dinucleotide deletion, CAC(his323) to C. They
caused the same shift in open reading frame predicted to encode a short
protein with 398 amino acids. The loss of 2 transmembrane domains and
gain of a new C-terminal sequence probably altered the protein
conformation and impaired the Rh complex assembly. The findings
established the molecular identity of an amorph Rh-null disease gene,
showing that Rh30 and Rh50 are both essential for the functioning of the
Rh structures as a multisubunit complex in the plasma membrane.

612041	TITLE *612041 RING FINGER PROTEIN 212; RNF212
;;ZHP3, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF; ZHP3;;
ZIP3-RELATED PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Jantsch et al. (2004) identified the human ring finger protein RNF212 as
an expressed sequence tag, Q86W82. It has considerable sequence homology
to the Caenorhabditis elegans protein Zhp3, which was shown by Jantsch
et al. (2004) to play a role in meiotic recombination.

Reynolds et al. (2013) cloned full-length mouse Rnf212. The deduced
307-amino acid protein has an N-terminal ring finger domain, followed by
a coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal serine-rich domain. The ring
finger domain is characteristic of E3 ligase enzymes that catalyze
protein modification by ubiquitin (see 191339)-like molecules. The human
RNF212 protein shares significant identity with the full-length mouse
protein and has a similar domain structure. Reynolds et al. (2013) also
identified 2 splice variants of mouse Rnf212 that encode C-terminally
truncated proteins of 133 and 52 amino acids. Immunohistochemical
analysis of mouse spermatocyte and oocyte nuclei revealed dynamic
localization of Rnf212 to synaptonemal complexes, including
pseudoautosomal regions of X-Y chromosomes. Rnf212 localized more weakly
to DNA double-strand break sites.

MAPPING

Kong et al. (2008) identified the RNF212 gene within a linkage
disequilibrium block on chromosome 4p16.3 associated with recombination
rate.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mutant mouse spermatocytes, Reynolds et al. (2013) found that
mouse Rnf212 localized to synaptonemal complexes due to high binding
affinity for the synaptonemal complex central element. Absence of the
central element caused defective localization of Rnf212.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kong et al. (2008) found 2 SNPs within the RNF212 gene, dbSNP rs3796619
(612041.0001) and dbSNP rs1670533 (612041.0002), that are associated
with inverse recombination rates in males and females. Haplotype CT was
associated with high male recombination rate and low female
recombination; the opposite was true for haplotype TC. A phylogenetic
analysis of a 55-kb region containing the SNPs dbSNP rs3796619 and dbSNP
1670533 in the HapMap data revealed 3 well-differentiated clusters of
haplotypes showing notable differences in frequency between the Yoruban
Nigerians and CEU and East Asians. The CT and TC haplotypes that
associated most strongly with recombination rate had a combined
frequency of only 17% in the Yoruban sample, but reached a frequency of
91% and 98% in the CEU and East Asian samples, respectively. Several
SNPs in this region showed an unusual degree of divergence among the
HapMap groups, on the basis of rank percentile of their F(ST) values
(the Wright coefficient, a measure of variance in allele frequencies
among populations) among all autosomal SNPs with the same overall
frequency in the HapMap.

ANIMAL MODEL

Jantsch et al. (2004) showed that Zhp3 knockout worms showed normal
homolog pairing and synaptonemal complex formation. The timing of
appearance and the nuclear localization of the recombination protein
Rad51 (179617) seemed normal in these animals, suggesting proper
initiation of meiotic recombination by DNA double-strand breaks.
However, the occurrence of univalents during diplotene indicated that C.
elegans Zhp3 protein is essential for reciprocal recombination between
homologous chromosomes and thus chiasma formation. In the absence of
Zhp3, reciprocal recombination was abolished and double-strand breaks
seemed to be repaired via alternative pathways, leading to achiasmatic
chromosomes and the occurrence of univalents during meiosis I.

Reynolds et al. (2013) found that both male and female Rnf212 -/- mice
appeared normal but were sterile. Male Rnf212 -/- mice showed reduced
testis size and absence of post-anaphase I cells. Rnf212 -/- ovaries
were similar in size to those of wildtype animals, and high numbers of
oocytes were present in mature animals. Both Rnf212 -/- spermatocyte and
oocyte nuclei showed apparently normal pachytene nuclei and fully
synapsed autosomes. However, X-Y synapsis was destabilized and crossover
complexes were absent in Rnf212 -/- spermatocytes. Reynolds et al.
(2013) found that Rnf212 was required to stabilize the meiosis-specific
factors Msh4 (602105) and Tex11 (300311).

RNF212, IVS, C/T

In a genomewide scan for variants associated with recombination rate
(612042), Kong et al. (2008) identified a SNP in the RNF212 gene, dbSNP
rs3796619, that was strongly associated. The SNP dbSNP rs3796619 was
strongly associated with male recombination rate (P = 3.2 x 10(-24)),
and each copy of allele T (compared with C) was estimated to decrease
recombination rate by 70.7 cM. This and another associated SNP in
RNF212, dbSNP rs1670533 (612041.0002), are in strong linkage
disequilibrium; for males, haplotype CT was associated with
significantly higher recombination rate than both TT and TC (P = 3.2 x
10(-7) and 7.0 x 10(-23), respectively). For females, haplotype TC was
associated with significantly higher recombination rate than both
haplotypes TT (P = 6.6 x 10(-7)) and CT (P = 5.4 x 10(-11)), although
there was not a significant difference between the latter 2 haplotypes.

In a genomewide scan for variants associated with recombination rate
(612042), Kong et al. (2008) identified a SNP in the RNF212 gene, dbSNP
rs1670533, that was strongly associated. The SNP dbSNP rs1670533 was
strongly associated with female recombination rate (P = 1.9 x 10(-12))
and, relative to the TT homozygote, each copy of allele C was estimated
to increase recombination rate by 88.2 cM. See also 612041.0001.

185620	TITLE *185620 SURFEIT 1; SURF1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mouse Surf1 cDNA as probe, Lennard et al. (1994) cloned human
SURF1 from placenta and HeLa cell cDNA libraries. The deduced 300-amino
acid protein shares 77% identity with mouse Surf1. Although mouse Surf1
is expressed as 3 alternatively spliced transcripts, Lennard et al.
(1994) found evidence for only 1 human SURF1 cDNA by PCR analysis.

Zhu et al. (1998) reported that the SURF1 gene encodes a deduced
300-amino acid protein that shares 25.6% sequence homology with the
yeast SHY1 homolog. Both proteins have a characteristic mitochondrial
targeting sequence in the N terminus and 2 putative conserved
transmembrane domains. Expression of human SURF1 cDNA with a C-terminal
tag in COS-7 cells colocalized SURF1 with a mitochondrial marker.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lennard et al. (1994) found that the major start sites of the SURF1 and
SURF2 (185630) genes are separated by 97 bp, although both genes have
multiple transcription start sites. The intergenic region is expected to
have bidirectional promoter activity, as is found in mouse. This region
lacks a TATA box, but is GC-rich. DNase footprint analysis showed 4
regions that interacted with HeLa cell nuclear factor complexes.

Duhig et al. (1998) stated that the 5-prime end of each of the surfeit
genes, including SURF1, is contained within a CpG island.

MAPPING

The mouse surfeit gene cluster contains 6 closely spaced housekeeping
genes, designated Surf1 to Surf6, unrelated by sequence homology
(Williams et al., 1988; Colombo et al., 1992). No more than 73 basepairs
separate any 2 of the 4 well-characterized surfeit cluster genes. Using
an interspecies backcross, Stubbs et al. (1990) mapped the surfeit and
Hox-5 gene clusters to the proximal portion of mouse chromosome 2. Surf
is close to the protooncogene Abl, near the centromere of mouse
chromosome 2. Williams et al. (1988) found that juxtaposition of 4 of
the genes was conserved in the human surfeit gene cluster.

By methods of nucleic acid hybridization using somatic cell hybrids and
by in situ hybridization, Yon et al. (1989) localized the human surfeit
gene cluster to chromosome bands 9q33-q34. Yon et al. (1993) confirmed
the localization of the surfeit cluster in 9q34 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization and showed that the organization and juxtaposition of the
human surfeit locus genes are the same as in the mouse. Furthermore,
analysis by FISH of metaphase spreads from human chronic myeloid
leukemic cells containing the t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation involving
the ABL gene (189980) at 9q34.1 and acute nonlymphocytic leukemic cells
containing the t(6;9)(p23;q34) translocation involving the CAN gene
(114350) at 9q34.1 demonstrated that the surfeit cluster is telomeric to
these 2 genes. Yon et al. (1993) commented that tuberous sclerosis-1
(191100) and nail-patella syndrome (NPS1; 161200) are distal to ABL.

EVOLUTION

Colombo et al. (1992) found that tight clustering and juxtaposition of
at least 5 of the surfeit genes, numbered 1 through 5, and their
associated CpG-rich islands are conserved over the 600 million years of
divergent evolution that separates birds and mammals. They suggested
that surfeit represents a different form of gene cluster in which gene
organization may play both a positive and a negative regulatory role in
gene expression, possibly via cis interactions between the closely
spaced genes.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhu et al. (1998) presented data indicating that SURF1 encodes a
putative assembly or maintenance factor which, in humans, appears to be
specific for the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) complex. See MOLECULAR
GENETICS section.

Using antibodies against a recombinant, labeled SURF1 protein in COS-7
cells, Tiranti et al. (1999) demonstrated that the protein is imported
into the mitochondria as a larger 35-kD precursor which is then
processed into the mature 30-kD product by the cleaving off of a
40-amino acid N-terminal leader polypeptide. Western blot analysis
showed that SURF1 is localized in and tightly bound to the inner
mitochondrial membrane. Cell lines with loss-of-function SURF1 mutations
had no detectable protein and no SURF1 transcripts, suggesting severe
mRNA instability. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis experiments on
SURF1 mutant and control cell lines showed that COX assembly in SURF1
mutants was blocked at an early step, most likely before the
incorporation of subunit II in the nascent intermediates composed of
subunit I alone or subunit I plus subunit IV.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Leigh syndrome (256000), also known as infantile subacute necrotizing
encephalopathy (SNE), is a severe neurologic disorder characterized by
bilaterally symmetric necrotic lesions in subcortical brain regions that
is commonly associated with systemic cytochrome c oxidase (COX)
deficiency (220110). COX deficiency is an autosomal recessive trait, and
most patients belong to a single genetic complementation group. Using
microcell-mediated chromosome transfer, Zhu et al. (1998) mapped the
gene defect in COX deficiency to 9q34 by complementation of the
respiratory chain deficiency in patient fibroblasts. SURF1 became a
positional candidate gene. Analysis of SURF1 revealed several mutations,
all of which predicted a truncated protein. The findings suggested a
role for SURF1 in the biogenesis of the COX complex and defined a new
class of gene defects causing human neurodegenerative disease.

In the mapping done by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer, Zhu et
al. (1998) transferred all 22 autosomes and the X chromosome, one at a
time, into a patient fibroblast line, to demonstrate correction of the
metabolic defect by chromosome 9. To refine the map position of the
defective gene on chromosome 9, Zhu et al. (1998) introduced deleted
versions of chromosome 9. The localization was narrowed further by
excluding regions of 9q by use of DNA markers in 2 small families.

Zhu et al. (1998) showed that the COX deficiency could be 'rescued' by
SURF1 cDNA in patient fibroblasts. They suggested that the functional
complementation approach could serve as a paradigm to map and clone
other nuclear genes associated with respiratory chain disorders, such as
mtDNA depletion syndrome (251880) or complex I-deficient Leigh syndrome
(252010).

Tiranti et al. (1998) used complementation assays based on the fusion of
cytochrome c oxidase-negative Leigh disease cell lines with several
rodent/human hybrid cells that had been made rho(0), i.e., deprived of
their own mtDNA by prolonged exposure to high doses of ethidium bromide,
to identify a COX-negative Leigh disease locus. Complementation of the
COX defect was obtained only with rodent/human rho(0) hybrids that
contained human chromosome 9. Linkage analysis restricted the disease
locus to the subtelomeric region of 9q, within the 7-cM interval between
markers D9S1847 and D9S1826. They sought mutations in candidate genes in
the region, including SURF1, the yeast homolog (SHY1) of which encodes a
mitochondrial protein necessary for the maintenance of COX activity and
respiration. Tiranti et al. (1998) found that SURF1 was mutated in the
probands of 9 COX-negative Leigh disease families; in the probands of 6
families, loss-of-function mutations were found on both alleles.

Poyau et al. (2000) studied fibroblasts from 3 patients suffering from
Leigh syndrome associated with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. Their
mitochondrial DNA was functional and all nuclear COX subunits had normal
sequences. The expression of transcripts encoding mitochondrial and
nuclear COX subunits was normal or slightly increased. Similarly, the
OXA1 (601066) transcript coding for a protein involved in COX assembly
was increased. However, several COX-protein subunits were severely
depressed, indicating deficient COX assembly. Sequence analysis of SURF1
in these 3 patients revealed 7 heterozygous mutations, 6 of which were
new: an insertion, a nonsense mutation, a splicing mutation at intron 7,
and 3 missense mutations. The gly124-to-glu mutation (185620.0012)
changed a gly that is strictly conserved in Surf1 homologs of 12
species.

Pequignot et al. (2001) stated that 30 different mutations in SURF1 had
been reported in 40 unrelated patients. Twenty mutations had been
described only once. The most frequent mutation involved a deletion of
10 bp and an insertion of 2 bp (AT) (185620.0003); this mutation was
found in 12 of 40 patients, and was homozygous in 3 of them. The second
most frequent mutation was a deletion of 2 bp, CT at position 845-846
(185620.0014); this mutation was found in 9 of 40 patients.

In 18 of 24 (75%) patients with COX-deficient LS, Tiranti et al. (1999)
identified 13 different mutations in the SURF1 gene. All of the
mutations, including frameshift, nonsense, and splice site mutations,
were predicted to result in loss of protein function. No missense
mutations were identified. In addition, no SURF1 mutations were found in
6 patients with COX deficiency classified as 'Leigh-like' or in 16
patients with COX deficiency classified as 'non-LS.' Tiranti et al.
(1999) concluded that SURF1 mutations are specifically associated with
LS and that SURF1 is the gene responsible for most of the COX-deficient
cases of LS.

In 3 cases with LS with COX deficiency, Moslemi et al. (2003) identified
4 pathogenic mutations in the SURF1 gene, including 2 novel mutations.
In all cases, the patients' fibroblasts showed reduced COX activity,
which was restored after transfection with normal SURF1 cDNA.

Najmabadi et al. (2011) performed homozygosity mapping followed by exon
enrichment and next-generation sequencing in 136 consanguineous families
(over 90% Iranian and less than 10% Turkish or Arabic) segregating
syndromic or nonsyndromic forms of autosomal recessive intellectual
disability. In family G008, they identified homozygosity for a missense
mutation in the SURF1 gene (185620.0015) in 2 sibs with mild
intellectual disability, ataxia, short stature, and facial dysmorphism,
diagnosed as a mild form of Leigh syndrome. The parents were first
cousins and had 2 healthy children.

ANIMAL MODEL

Agostino et al. (2003) created a constitutive knockout mouse for Surf1
by replacing exons 5 to 7 of Surf1 with a neomycin-resistance (neo)
cassette. Postimplantation embryonic lethality affected 90% of Surf1 -/-
homozygotes; approximately 30% of liveborn animals died within the first
postnatal month, and an additional 15% died within the first 6 months of
life. Significant deficit in muscle strength and motor performance was
observed, without obvious abnormalities in brain morphology or overt
neurologic symptoms. A profound and isolated defect of COX activity in
skeletal muscle and liver was detected, and reduced histochemical
reaction to COX and mitochondrial proliferation in skeletal muscle was
present.

Dell'Agnello et al. (2007) created Surf1 -/- mice by inserting a loxP
sequence in exon 7, which resulted in a truncated Surf1 protein that was
not expressed. These Surf1 -/- mice were born at the expected mendelian
frequency, indicating that the lethality observed in the previous Surf1
-/- mouse model (Agostino et al., 2003) was not caused by ablation of
Surf1 itself, but rather by the presence of the neo cassette or by the
elimination of regulatory elements in the deleted region. The Surf1 -/-
mice created by Dell'Agnello et al. (2007) showed no neurologic or
extraneurologic defects, although they had a mild defect in COX assembly
and activity. Surf1 -/- animals had a prolonged life span and resistance
to the Ca(2+)-dependent excitotoxic activity of kainic acid compared
with wildtype animals. Primary cultures of Surf1 -/- neurons showed
resistance to glutamate toxicity, reduced glutamate-induced increase in
Ca(2+) in both cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments, and reduced
mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake compared with controls. Dell'Agnello et al.
(2007) concluded that the effects of Surf1 ablation on Ca(2+)
homeostasis, and possibly on longevity, may be independent from those on
COX assembly and mitochondrial bioenergetics.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX IV DEFICIENCY
SURF1, 765C-T

In a patient with Leigh syndrome (256000), Zhu et al. (1998) identified
compound heterozygosity for a 765C-T nonsense mutation in exon 7 and a
337+2T-C mutation in the donor splice site of intron 4 (185620.0002) of
the SURF1 gene.

.0002
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX IV DEFICIENCY
SURF1, IVS4, T-C, +2

See 185620.0001 and Zhu et al. (1998). The donor splice site mutation
led to deletion of exon 4; this appeared to result from the use of a
cryptic donor sequence (GT) at the 5-prime end of exon 4, which caused
the removal of exon and intron 4 when the wildtype donor consensus
sequence in intron 4 was mutated.

.0003
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX IV DEFICIENCY
SURF1, 2-BP INS/10-BP DEL, NT326

In a patient with Leigh syndrome (256000), Zhu et al. (1998) identified
compound heterozygosity for an insertion/deletion mutation in exon 4
(326insATdelTCTGCCAGCC), which created a nonsense codon at the site of
the mutation, and a 2-bp deletion in exon 9 which removed 1 of the 3 CT
repeats between positions 855 and 860. The latter mutation was
designated 855delCT (185620.0004).

Poyau et al. (2000) found the insertion/deletion mutation in compound
heterozygosity with a gly124-to-glu mutation (185620.0012).

.0005
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX IV DEFICIENCY
SURF1, 1-BP INS, 882T

In a patient with Leigh syndrome (256000), Zhu et al. (1998) found
homozygosity for insertion of a T into a string of Ts, creating a
nonsense codon. The mutation was designated 882insT. This and 4 other
mutations found by Zhu et al. (1998) in cases of Leigh syndrome
predicted a truncated protein product.

.0006
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX IV DEFICIENCY
SURF1, GLN251TER

In their family G with Leigh syndrome (256000), Tiranti et al. (1998)
found homozygosity for a 751C-T transition in exon 7 of the SURF1 gene,
resulting in a change from gln to stop at codon 251.

Tiranti et al. (1999) reported monozygotic twin females with Leigh
syndrome as a result of inheritance of this mutation through uniparental
disomy of maternal chromosome 9.

.0007
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX IV DEFICIENCY
SURF1, 1-BP INS, 868T

In their family C with Leigh syndrome (256000), Tiranti et al. (1998)
found homozygosity for a frameshift due to insertion of a T after
nucleotide 868 in exon 9 of the SURF1 gene.

.0008
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX IV DEFICIENCY
SURF1, IVS5DS, T-G, +2

In their family B with Leigh syndrome (256000), Tiranti et al. (1998)
found that COX-negative Leigh syndrome was associated with compound
heterozygosity for a splice mutation and a frameshift deletion: 516+2T-G
in exon 5 and deletion of AG after nucleotide 550 in exon 60
(185620.0009).

LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX IV DEFICIENCY
SURF1, TYR274ASP

In a Japanese patient with Leigh syndrome (256000), Teraoka et al.
(1999) found compound heterozygosity for mutations in the SURF1 gene: a
T-to-G transversion at nucleotide 820, resulting in a tyr274-to-asp
substitution, and a 2-bp deletion at nucleotide 790 (185620.0011). The
patient was the offspring of nonconsanguineous parents. From the age of
10 months, the patient showed neurologic signs and symptoms, starting
with impairment of movement. At the age of 14 months, he could no longer
crawl. At the age of 17 months, his height and weight were far below
normal. At the age of 18 months, tendon reflexes were hypoactive and
intentional tremor of the limbs developed. There were ocular motor
abnormalities, including slow saccades and bilateral internal
strabismus. Respiratory failure gradually developed, necessitating
intermittent assisted ventilation. Magnetic resonance imaging showed
bilateral, symmetric signal increases in basal ganglia, cerebellum
dentate nucleus, and around the aqueduct of the midbrain. Cerebrospinal
fluid lactate and pyruvic acid concentrations were elevated. However,
blood lactate and pyruvic acid concentrations were not elevated. On
muscle biopsy, no mitochondrial alterations were found, and none of the
3 mitochondrial DNA mutations associated with Leigh syndrome was
detected. The enzyme activity of COX was diffusely and severely
decreased in muscle, and no COX activity was demonstrable in blood
vessels, peripheral nerves, and fibroblasts.

MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX IV DEFICIENCY
SURF1, 2-BP DEL, 790AG

See 185620.0010 and Teraoka et al. (1999).

Rahman et al. (2001) described a 2-year-old girl, born of healthy,
consanguineous Bengali parents, who presented with failure to thrive,
global neurodevelopmental regression, and lactic acidosis. MRI of the
brain showed leukodystrophy with involvement of the corticospinal
tracts. There were no basal ganglia necrotic lesions characteristic of
Leigh syndrome. Respiratory chain enzyme assays on biopsied muscle
revealed a severe isolated deficiency of COX (220110). Sequence analysis
of the SURF1 gene showed homozygosity for a 2-bp deletion at nucleotides
790-791. The patient's parents were heterozygotes. The authors suggested
assaying respiratory chain enzymes in patients with leukodystrophy and
lactic acidosis and sequencing SURF1 in patients with isolated COX
deficiency.

.0012
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX IV DEFICIENCY
SURF1, GLY124GLU

Poyau et al. (2000) identified a 385G-A transition in the SURF1 gene
predicted to cause a gly124-to-glu (G124E) amino acid change. The
parents were unrelated. The patient showed normal early motor and
intellectual milestones but developed a progressive neurologic disease
with motor and intellectual regression leading to a fatal
encephalopathy. The patient was a compound heterozygote; the other
allele carried a 2-bp insertion/10-bp deletion (185620.0003).

.0013
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX IV DEFICIENCY
SURF1, 4-BP INS, 572CCCT

In a 10-year-old boy with an unusually mild clinical course of Leigh
syndrome (256000), Salviati et al. (2004) found compound heterozygosity
for mutations in the SURF1 gene. A 4-bp insertion (CCCT) at nucleotide
572 of exon 6, which was associated with a common polymorphism (573C-G)
on the same allele, caused a predicted premature termination signal 7
codons downstream. The other mutation was a 10-bp deletion/2-bp
insertion in exon 4 (185620.0003). His mother harbored the exon 4
mutation and his father carried the exon 6 mutation. At age 39 months,
the patient had no MRI lesions; at 8 years of age, MRI showed only
brainstem and cerebellar involvement without lesions in the basal
ganglia or subthalamic nuclei. Salviati et al. (2004) concluded that the
spectrum of MRI findings in Leigh syndrome is variable and that SURF1
mutations should be considered in patients with encephalopathy and COX
deficiency even when early MRI findings are negative.

.0014
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX IV DEFICIENCY
SURF1, 2-BP DEL, 845CT

In 9 of 40 unrelated patients with Leigh syndrome due to cytochrome c
oxidase deficiency (256000), Pequignot et al. (2001) identified a 2-bp
deletion in the SURF1 gene (845delCT).

Bohm et al. (2006) found that the 845delCT mutation was the most common
SURF1 mutation in 47 patients from 35 families with Leigh syndrome and
cytochrome c oxidase deficiency (see 220110) due to SURF1 mutations. The
deletion was present in 89% of independent alleles.

.0015
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX IV DEFICIENCY
SURF1, TRP227ARG

In family G008, Najmabadi et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for an
A-to-G transition in the SURF1 gene at genomic coordinate Chr9:135209194
(NCBI36), resulting in a trp227-to-arg (W227R) substitution, in 2 sibs
with mild intellectual disability, ataxia, short stature, and facial
dysmorphism, diagnosed as a mild form of Leigh syndrome. The
first-cousin parents were heterozygous for the mutation and had 2
healthy children.

606305	TITLE *606305 PROTOCADHERIN-GAMMA, SUBFAMILY C, MEMBER 4; PCDHGC4
;;PCDH-GAMMA-C4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules, and
protocadherins constitute a subfamily of nonclassic cadherins. PCDHGC4
is 1 of 22 tandemly arranged genes within the PCDHG gene cluster
(604968) on chromosome 5q31. The 22 PCDHG genes function as 'variable'
exons that are individually spliced to a downstream constant region to
form distinct PCDHG transcripts. The variable PCDHG exons encode the
extracellular and transmembrane domains of the protocadherin protein,
and the common region encodes the intracellular domain (Wu et al.,
2001). For further information on the PCDHG genes, see 604968.

CLONING

Using PCR on a brain cDNA library, Wu and Maniatis (1999) obtained cDNAs
encoding PCDHGC4. Sequence analysis predicted that the 938-amino acid
PCDHGC4 protein (GenBank GENBANK AAD43732) is 48% identical to PCDHGA3
(606290). The C-terminal 134 amino acids of PCDHGC4 and PCDHGA3 are
identical and have a lysine-rich motif. PCDHGC4 has a signal peptide, 2
putative N-linked glycosylation sites, 6 cadherin ectodomains, a
transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic domain.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2001) mapped the PCDHGC4 gene
to chromosome 5q31, between PCDHGC3 (603627) and PCDHGC5 (606306). They
localized the mouse PCDHG genes to chromosome 18c.

190170	TITLE *190170 TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR, ALPHA; TGFA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Transforming growth factors (TGFs) are biologically active polypeptides
that reversibly confer the transformed phenotype on cultured cells.
TGF-alpha shows about 40% sequence homology with epidermal growth factor
(EGF; 131530) and competes with EGF for binding to the EGF receptor
(131550), stimulating its phosphorylation and producing a mitogenic
response.

GENE STRUCTURE

Collin et al. (1999) determined the exon-intron structure of the TGFA
gene and excluded it as a candidate for Alstrom syndrome (203800).

MAPPING

Brissenden et al. (1985) used a human genomic DNA clone to map the TGFA
locus to chromosome 2p13-2p11 in somatic cell hybrids with confirmation
by in situ hybridization. They commented on the possible significance of
the fact that in Burkitt lymphoma with 2;8 translocation, the breakpoint
is at chromosome 2p13-p11. Thus, t(2;8) might place TGFA near the MYC
oncogene. Tricoli et al. (1985, 1986) likewise assigned TGFA to
chromosome chromosome 2p13 by in situ hybridization. Fowler et al.
(1993) demonstrated that the murine Tgfa gene is linked to Igkc
(147200), Fabp1 (134650), and Ly-2 (CD8A; 186910) on chromosome 6.

GENE FUNCTION

Ellis et al. (1987) presented evidence that TGFA plays a role in certain
paraneoplastic manifestations of melanoma: the sign of Leser-Trelat (the
sudden appearance of, or increase in the number and size of, seborrheic
keratoses), acanthosis nigricans, and eruptive acrochordons (sudden
onset of multiple skin tags).

Fernandez-Larrea et al. (1999) used the 2-hybrid screen to identify
pro-TGF-alpha cytoplasmic domain-binding proteins, which they referred
to as TACIPs (pro-TGF-alpha cytoplasmic domain-interacting proteins),
involved in the trafficking of pro-TGF-alpha. They cloned 2 such
proteins, which they designated TACIP1 (601017) and TACIP18 (602217).

The circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus is thought to drive
daily rhythms of behavior by secreting factors that act locally within
the hypothalamus. In a systematic screen, Kramer et al. (2001)
identified TGFA as a likely suprachiasmatic nucleus inhibitor of
locomotion. TGFA is expressed rhythmically in the suprachiasmatic
nucleus, and when infused into the third ventricle it reversibly
inhibited locomotor activity and disrupted circadian sleep-wake cycles.
These actions were mediated by EGF receptors on neurons in the
hypothalamic subparaventricular zone. Mice with a hypomorphic EGF
receptor mutation exhibited excessive daytime locomotor activity and
failed to suppress activity when exposed to light. Kramer et al. (2001)
concluded that their results implicate EGF receptor signaling in the
daily control of locomotor activity. They identified a neural circuit in
the hypothalamus that likely mediates the regulation of behavior both by
the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the retina using TGFA and EGF receptors
in the retinohypothalamic tract.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

orofacial clefting, see OFC2 (602966).

614459	TITLE *614459 TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 138; TMEM138
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TMEM138 is required for the assembly and function of cilia (Lee et al.,
2012).

CLONING

Lee et al. (2012) identified the TMEM138 gene near the TMEM216 (613277)
gene in a region of chromosome 11 linked to Joubert syndrome-2 (JBTS2;
608091). They obtained TMEM138 clones, including potential variants,
from a human fetal brain cDNA library. The deduced major isoform of
TMEM138 contains 162 amino acids and has an N-terminal signal sequence
followed by 3 transmembrane domains. Expression profiling showed TMEM138
expression in all tissues examined. In situ hybridization of human
embryos at 4 to 8 weeks' gestation revealed ubiquitous TMEM138
expression that increased with time. TMEM138 expression appeared to
parallel TMEM216 expression in all tissues examined. Immunohistochemical
analysis of mouse IMCD3 cells and transfected COS-7 cells revealed that
Tmem138 localized to ciliary axoneme/basal body and that Tmem216
localized to basal body and to the Golgi apparatus surrounding the base
of cilium. The 2 proteins also appeared to localize to different vesicle
pools that moved toward the primary cilia over time. Tmem138 vesicles,
but not Tmem216 vesicles, colocalized with endogenous Cep290 (610142) in
IMCD3 cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lee et al. (2012) determined that the TMEM138 gene contains 5 exons, the
first of which is noncoding. The 23-kb intergenic region between TMEM138
and TMEM216 contains a functional conserved RFX4 (603958)-binding site.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lee et al. (2012) mapped the TMEM138 gene
to chromosome 11q12.2, 23 kb from the TMEM216 gene. TMEM138 and TMEM216
are in a head-to-tail orientation.

Lee et al. (2012) mapped the mouse Tmem138 gene to a region of
chromosome 19 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
11q12.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (2012) found that RFX4 mediated coordinated expression of
TMEM138 and TMEM216 by binding to a regulatory element within their
intergenic region. Knockdown of either Tmem138 or Tmem216 in mouse IMCD3
cells resulted in short cilia and a defect in ciliogenesis. Knockdown of
Tmem216 disrupted vesicular trafficking of Tmem138 and Cep290, whereas
knockdown of Tmem138 had little effect on vesicular movement of Tmem216.
Knockdown of Trappc9 (611966), a component of the transport protein
particle (TRAPP) II complex, disrupted vesicular tethering of both
proteins and reduced ciliogenesis.

EVOLUTION

Lee et al. (2012) found that the TMEM138 and TMEM216 genes are aligned
in a head-to-tail orientation, with a conserved intergenic region, in
higher vertebrates only. They determined that the 2 genes came into
close association during an ancient chromosomal rearrangement at the
amphibian-to-reptile transition about 340 million years ago.
Conservation in the intergenic region becomes progressively weaker from
human to anolis lizard, and the orthologous genes map to different
chromosomes in zebrafish.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By repeat sequencing of candidate genes in 6 consanguineous Arab
families with Joubert syndrome showing linkage to the JBTS2 locus
(608091) on chromosome 11q13, but who were negative for mutations in the
TMEM216 gene (613277), Lee et al. (2012) identified homozygous mutations
in the TMEM138 gene (614459.0001-614459.0005). None of the mutations was
found in 400 controls. Two additional patients from consanguineous Arab
families were also found to carry homozygous TMEM138 mutations. The
phenotype included the molar tooth sign on brain imaging, oculomotor
apraxia, variable coloboma, and rare kidney involvement. The phenotype
was indistinguishable from that caused by mutation in TMEM216 gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lee et al. (2012) found that knockdown of zebrafish Tmem138 or Tmem216
resulted in similar, but distinct, phenotypes. Knockdown of either gene
resulted in pericardial effusion, curved or kinked tail, and
gastrulation defects. However, only knockdown of Tmem16 resulted in
hydrocephalic brains.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
JOUBERT SYNDROME 16
TMEM138, IVS2DS, G-A, +5

In affected members of 2 consanguineous Arab families with Joubert
syndrome-16 (JBTS16; 614465), Lee et al. (2012) identified a homozygous
G-to-A transition in exon 2 of the TMEM138 gene, resulting in a splice
site mutation at a highly conserved position. Features were somewhat
variable, but included the molar tooth sign on brain imaging, oculomotor
apraxia, and coloboma. One patient had cystic kidneys and another had
polydactyly.

In 2 Arab sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with JBTS16 (614465),
Lee et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 287A-G transition in the
TMEM138 gene, resulting in a his96-to-arg (H96R) substitution in a
highly conserved residue. A 17-year-old boy had the molar tooth sign and
a Dandy-Walker malformation, oculomotor apraxia, and nephronophthisis.
An affected fetus had an encephalocele and was diagnosed with Meckel
syndrome. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant
H96R protein was expressed at about 40% of control levels, suggesting a
loss of function as the disease mechanism.

TMEM138 gene, resulting in a tyr130-to-cys (Y130C) substitution in a
highly conserved residue. The patient had the molar tooth sign,
oculomotor apraxia, coloboma, and cystic kidneys. Six deceased sibs were
reportedly affected.

601340	TITLE *601340 MELANOMA INHIBITORY ACTIVITY PROTEIN; MIA
;;CARTILAGE-DERIVED RETINOIC ACID-SENSITIVE PROTEIN; CDRAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Growth and expansion of tumor cells including malignant melanomas are
modulated by a complex network of growth factors, which regulate
proliferation and cell-matrix interaction through a variety of different
signal transduction pathways. Blesch et al. (1994) purified a protein
they called melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) which is secreted by
malignant melanoma cells and elicits growth inhibition of melanoma cells
in vitro. Bosserhoff et al. (1996) cloned the gene encoding MIA and
described its genomic organization. The gene encodes a 131-amino acid
prepropolypeptide with a 24-residue secretion signal peptide sequence.
The authors identified the transcription start site of the gene and
studied the expression characteristics of the gene promoter in human
melanoma, epithelial, and undifferentiated cells. Bosserhoff et al.
(1996) found by Northern blot analysis that the MIA gene was expressed
in all melanoma cell lines tested but was not expressed in fibroblast or
epithelial cell lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bosserhoff et al. (1996) determined that the MIA gene comprises 4 exons.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Bosserhoff et al. (1997) determined that MIA levels in patients with
metastatic malignant melanoma were significantly above the 97th
percentile level (6.5 ng/ml) determined for 72 normal controls. In a
blinded, multicenter trial, Bosserhoff et al. (2000) analyzed serum MIA
levels by ELISA in 259 patients with stage III and stage IV metastatic
malignant melanoma. MIA levels were elevated in both groups and
decreased significantly after surgery. MIA levels subsequently increased
in 29 of 34 patients with rapid disease progression and decreased in 5
patients who responded to immunochemotherapy. Bosserhoff et al. (2000)
suggested that MIA levels have prognostic value in staging and
monitoring tumor load in malignant melanoma.

- Crystal Structure

Lougheed et al. (2001) reported the crystal structure of human MIA. They
stated that this was the first structural characterization of a secreted
protein with an SH3 subdomain.

MAPPING

Koehler et al. (1996) mapped the MIA gene to 19q13.32-q13.33 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

;;ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR, NEURONAL NICOTINIC, BETA-4 SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are members of a
superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast signal
transmission at synapses. The nAChRs are thought to be (hetero)pentamers
composed of homologous subunits. See 118508 for additional background
information on AChRs.

Tarroni et al. (1992) cloned a partial beta-4 subunit cDNA by screening
a human neuroblastoma cDNA library with a rat beta-4 subunit probe.
Using Northern blots and RT-PCR, Tarroni et al. (1992) found that the
human beta-4 subunit is expressed as a 3.1-kb mRNA in neuroblastoma and
small-cell lung carcinoma cell lines. Elliott et al. (1996) isolated a
complete beta-4 clone from a neuroblastoma cell line cDNA library. The
predicted 498-amino acid protein is 84% identical to rat beta-4 protein.
They demonstrated that human beta-4 encoded a functional receptor when
expressed in combination with alpha-2 (118502), alpha-3 (118503), or
alpha-4 (118504) subunits in Xenopus oocytes. Groot Kormelink and Luyten
(1997) also cloned a complete beta-4 cDNA from neuroblastoma cell line
mRNA. On Northern blots of a neuroblastoma cell line, Groot Kormelink
and Luyten (1997) found that the human beta-4 subunit is expressed as a
2.4-kb mRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Transmitter-gated cation channels are detectors of excitatory chemical
signals at synapses in the nervous system. Khakh et al. (2000) showed
that structurally distinct alpha-3-beta-4 nicotinic and P2X(2) (600844)
channels influence each other when coactivated. The activation of one
channel type affects distinct kinetic and conductance states of the
other, and coactivation results in nonadditive responses owing to
inhibition of both channel types. State-dependent inhibition of
nicotinic channels was revealed most clearly with mutant P2X(2)
channels, and inhibition was decreased at lower densities of channel
expression. In synaptically coupled myenteric neurons, nicotinic fast
excitatory postsynaptic currents were occluded during activation of
endogenously coexpressed P2X channels. Khakh et al. (2000) concluded
that their data provide a molecular basis and a synaptic context for
cross-inhibition between transmitter-gated channels.

Lou et al. (2007) reported a generalized MDR (GMDR) method that
permitted adjustment for discrete and quantitative covariates and was
applicable to both dichotomous and continuous phenotypes in
population-based studies of various designs. They applied the method to
a genetic study of 4 genes that were reported to be associated with
nicotine dependence (188890): CHRNA2 (118502), CHRNB4, BDNF (113503),
and NTRK2 (600456). They found significant joint action between CHRNB4
and NTRK2. Lou et al. (2007) commented that ubiquity of joint actions
appears to be a natural property of complex inherited traits and that
the term 'epistasis,' coined for a specific type of gene-by-gene
interaction, has evolved to have different meanings in biologic and
statistical genetics.

By using a combination of pharmacologic, molecular genetic,
electrophysiologic, and feeding studies, Mineur et al. (2011) found that
activation of hypothalamic alpha-3 (118503)-beta-4 nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors leads to activation of proopiomelanocortin
(POMC; 176830) neurons. POMC neurons and subsequent activation of
melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4R; 155541) were critical for
nicotinic-induced decreases in food intake in mice. The study of Mineur
et al. (2011) demonstrated that nicotine decreases food intake and body
weight by influencing the hypothalamic melanocortin system and
identified critical molecular and synaptic mechanisms involved in
nicotine-induced decreases in appetite.

MAPPING

Raimondi et al. (1992) mapped the CHRNA3 (118503), CHRNA5 (118505), and
CHRNB4 genes to 15q24 by in situ hybridization and demonstrated that the
3 genes are physically linked.

Amos et al. (2008) placed the CHRNA3, CHRNA5, CHRNB4, and PSMA4 (176846)
genes within a 100-kb region on chromosome 15q25.1.

;;SCOTIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zhang et al. (2000) cloned a cDNA encoding Scotin, which they called
HSPC217, from CD34 (142230)-positive hematopoietic stem/progenitor
cells. The deduced 170-amino acid protein contains an MYB (189990)
DNA-binding domain repeat signature. Microarray analysis of 5
hematopoietic cell lines detected low-level expression of Scotin in NB4
and Jurkat cells, but no expression was detected in HL60, K562, and U937
cells.

Bourdon et al. (2002) identified mouse Scotin by differential display of
spleen and thymus of normal and p53 (191170) null mice after gamma
irradiation of whole animals. The induced 1.85-kb transcript encodes a
deduced 235-amino acid protein. By searching an EST database using the
mouse sequence as probe, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Bourdon
et al. (2002) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding Scotin from a placenta
cDNA library. The deduced 240-amino acid human protein shares 70%
identity with mouse Scotin. Both the human and the mouse proteins
contain an N-terminal signal sequence, a central transmembrane domain
composed of 18 hydrophobic amino acids, and a proline/tyrosine domain,
and both show an apparent molecular mass of 25 kD by Western blot
analysis. Immunolocalization of exogenously expressed Scotin revealed
colocalization with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers. By mutation
analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the proline-rich domain
is required for ER localization.

GENE FUNCTION

Bourdon et al. (2002) noted that mouse thymus and spleen cells underwent
massive p53-dependent apoptosis following ultraviolet irradiation or
exposure to actinomycin D. They found that Scotin mRNA was induced
coincident with apoptosis and was expressed only in spleen and thymus of
irradiated wildtype mice and not in the spleen or thymus of irradiated
p53 null mice. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, they
confirmed direct binding between p53 and Scotin, and using a luciferase
reporter plasmid driven by the mouse Scotin promoter, they confirmed
dose-dependent p53 transactiviation. Furthermore, Bourdon et al. (2002)
showed that the apoptosis induced by the p53/Scotin pathway is caspase
dependent.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the
human Scotin gene contains 6 exons. They identified a p53-responsive
element of 9 decamers within the mouse Scotin promoter.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Zhang et al. (2000) mapped the human
Scotin gene to chromosome 3. By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et
al. (2002) mapped the Scotin gene to chromosome 3p21.3. They also
identified a Scotin pseudogene on chromosome Xq13.1-q13.3.

610781	TITLE *610781 GUANOSINE MONOPHOSPHATE REDUCTASE 2; GMPR2
;;GMP REDUCTASE 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching with the sequence of GMPR1 (GMPR; 139265) as
query, Deng et al. (2002) identified and subsequently cloned GMPR2 from
a human fetal brain cDNA library. The deduced 348-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 37.9 kD and shares 90% sequence identity
with GMPR1 and 69% identity with E. coli GMPR. Northern blot analysis
detected relatively high levels of both GMPR1 and GMPR2 in heart,
skeletal muscle, and kidney, and relatively low levels of both in colon,
thymus, and peripheral blood leukocyte. Strong signals of GMPR2 were
detected in brain, liver, and placenta, whereas weak signals of GMPR1
were observed in these tissues. The apparent Km of GMPR2 for NADPH and
GMP are 26.6 and 17.4 microM, respectively.

Zhang et al. (2003) cloned GMPR2 from a human dendritic cell cDNA
library. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of an
approximately 2.2-kb transcript, with high expression in testis, ovary,
prostate, heart, liver, spleen, skeletal muscle, and kidney. An
additional transcript of about 1.3 kb was detected in placenta.
Expression was also detected in most cancer cell lines studied.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2003) showed that recombinant GMPR2 protein was able to
reduce GMP. Transfection experiments demonstrated that overexpression of
GMPR2 promoted the monocytic differentiation of HL-60 leukemia cells.

EVOLUTION

Deng et al. (2002) presented evidence that the 2 types of GMP reductase
are derived from duplication of an ancient gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Deng et al. (2002) determined that the GMPR2 gene contains 10 exons and
spans more than 6.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Deng et al. (2002) mapped the GMPR2 gene
to chromosome 14p11.2-p11.1. By the same method, Zhang et al. (2003)
mapped the gene to chromosome 14q11-q21.

;;KIR4.2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The potassium channel inward rectifiers (Kir) constitute a family of
potassium channels that maintain the resting membrane potential close to
the equilibrium potential for potassium ions.

CLONING

By isolating, mapping, and sequencing trapped exons and captured cDNAs
from cosmids of the Down syndrome (190685) chromosome region (DSCR) on
21q22.2, Gosset et al. (1997) discovered a gene, designated KCNJ15,
encoding a member of the Kir family. The deduced protein contains 375
amino acids. Gosset et al. (1997) found that KCNJ15 is expressed in
kidney and lung during human development and in several adult tissues
including kidney and brain.

Okamoto et al. (2010) stated that expression of KCNJ15 in the pancreas
is relatively high, as is that in the kidney, thymus, and whole blood.
Immunofluorescence staining of tissue from nondiabetic patients revealed
that expression of KCNJ15 in Langerhans islets of the pancreas was
prominent compared to that of the exocrine glands.

MAPPING

Gosset et al. (1997) identified the KCNJ15 gene within the Down syndrome
chromosome region on 21q22.2. Another inwardly rectifying potassium
channel gene, that encoding Kir3.2 (KCNJ6; 600877), had been mapped
within the DSCR.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Okamoto et al. (2010) identified a synonymous SNP in exon 4 of the
KCNJ15 gene (dbSNP rs3746876, C566T) that showed significant association
with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; 125853) affecting lean individuals
in 3 independent Japanese sample sets (p = 2.5 x 10(-7); odds ratio,
2.54) and with unstratified T2DM (p = 6.7 x 10(-6); OR, 1.76). The
diabetes risk allele frequency was, however, very low among Europeans
and no association between the variant and T2DM could be shown in a
Danish case-control study. Functional analysis in HEK293 cells
demonstrated that the risk T allele increased KCNJ15 expression via
increased mRNA stability, which resulted in higher expression of protein
compared to the C allele.

603291	TITLE *603291 BCL2/ADENOVIRUS E1B 19-KD PROTEIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; BNIP1
;;NIP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with
discrete domains of the E1B 19-kD protein, which is involved in
suppression of cell death, Boyd et al. (1994) cloned human B-cell cDNAs
encoding NIP1, NIP2 (603292), and NIP3 (603293). The deduced NIP1
protein has 228 amino acids and contains a putative membrane-spanning
hydrophobic domain. Although the authors found no significant sequence
homology between NIP1 and other proteins, they identified a 59- to
83-amino acid region of NIP1 that shows 29% to 36% identity to a
conserved region within the catalytic domain of 3 mammalian
3-prime-5-prime-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases. Boyd et al. (1994)
localized NIP1 to the nuclear envelope region and to other cytoplasmic
structures.

GENE FUNCTION

Adenovirus E1B 19-kD protein protects against cell death induced by
viral infection and certain external stimuli. Using yeast 2-hybrid
analysis, Boyd et al. (1994) showed that NIP1, NIP2, and NIP3 interacted
with the adenovirus E1B 19-kD protein and with human BCL2 (151430),
which can functionally substitute for the 19-kD protein during
adenovirus infection. The interactions occurred at bipartite sequence
motifs common to both the E1B 19-kD and BCL2 proteins.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the BNIP1 gene to chromosome 5q35.1 based on an
alignment of the BNIP1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF083956) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

606591	TITLE *606591 MUS81, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; MUS81
;;SLX3, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; SLX3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for sequences with similarity to S. pombe and S. cerevisiae
Mus81, followed by PCR using a cerebellum cDNA library, Chen et al.
(2001) cloned the human homolog of yeast Mus81. The open reading frame
of human MUS81 predicts a translation product of 551 amino acids with a
molecular mass of 59 kD. The predicted protein has 25% identity to Mus81
of fission yeast. Sequence alignment of the human, mouse, fission yeast,
and budding yeast proteins revealed that the similarity is highest
around the VERKX3D motif, which is conserved in the XPF family of
nucleases. Helix-hairpin-helix DNA-binding domains in the N and C
termini of the protein also appeared to be conserved. Northern blot
analysis showed that MUS81 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in several
human cell types and cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Chen et al. (2001) showed that MUS81 has associated endonuclease
activity against structure-specific oligonucleotide substrates,
including synthetic Holliday junctions. MUS81-associated endonuclease
resolved Holliday junctions into linear duplexes by cutting across the
junction exclusively on strands of like polarity. In addition, MUS81
protein abundance increased in cells following exposure to agents that
block DNA replication. Taken together, these findings suggested a role
for MUS81 in resolving Holliday junctions that arise when DNA
replication is blocked by damage or by nucleotide depletion. The authors
stated that MUS81 is not related by sequence to previously characterized
Holliday junction-resolving enzymes, and it has distinct enzymatic
properties that suggest it uses a novel enzymatic strategy to cleave
Holliday junctions.

Ciccia et al. (2003) showed that recombinant MUS81 interacted with
recombinant EME1 (610885) and EME2 (610886). EME1/MUS81 heterodimers
showed DNA endonuclease activity against 3-prime flap and replication
fork substrates, but activity was much lower against splayed arm and
Holliday junction substrates. Neither EME1 nor MUS81 alone showed
nuclease activity.

Ciccia et al. (2007) found that the EME2/MUS81 heterodimer exhibited DNA
endonuclease activity against 3-prime flap and splayed arm substrates.

Zeng et al. (2009) showed that MUS81 contributes to the alternative
lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway for maintenance of telomere
length in telomerase-negative human cancer cell lines that utilized the
ALT pathway. In ALT cells only, MUS81 localized to PML (102578)-positive
nuclear bodies and with telomeric DNA, which was enriched during the G2
phase of the cell cycle in synchronized ALT cells. Depletion of MUS81
via short hairpin RNA in ALT cells resulted in reduced ALT-specific
recombination, defective S phase and proliferation, and loss of telomere
signals. MUS81 did not participate in global telomere maintenance in
non-ALT cell lines. Mutation analysis showed that the endonuclease
activity of MUS81 was required for recombination-based ALT cell
survival. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis and mass spectrometry revealed
that MUS81 interacted with TRF2 (TERF2; 602027) as well as EME1. The
interaction of MUS81 with TRF2 inhibited the nuclease activity of MUS81;
chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the binding of MUS81
to TRF2 interfered with the binding of MUS81 to DNA. Zeng et al. (2009)
concluded that MUS81 is involved in the maintenance of ALT cell survival
at least in part by homologous recombination of telomeres.

Wechsler et al. (2011) used Bloom syndrome (210900) cells, in which the
BLM gene (604610) is inactive, to analyze human cells compromised for
the known Holliday junction dissolution/resolution pathways. Wechsler et
al. (2011) showed that depletion of MUS81 and GEN1 (612449), or SLX4
(613278) and GEN1, from Bloom syndrome cells results in severe
chromosome abnormalities, such that sister chromatids remain interlinked
in a side-by-side arrangement and the chromosomes are elongated and
segmented. Wechsler et al. (2011) concluded that normally replicating
human cells require Holliday junction processing activities to prevent
sister chromatid entanglements and thereby ensure accurate chromosome
condensation. This phenotype was not apparent when both MUS81 and SLX4
were depleted from Bloom syndrome cells, suggesting that GEN1 can
compensate for their absence. Additionally, Wechsler et al. (2011)
showed that depletion of MUS81 or SLX4 reduces the high frequency of
sister chromatid exchanges in Bloom syndrome cells, indicating that
MUS81 and SLX4 promote sister chromatid exchange formation, in events
that may ultimately drive the chromosome instabilities that underpin
early-onset cancers associated with Bloom syndrome.

MAPPING

Chen et al. (2001) mapped the MUS81 gene to chromosome 11q13 by FISH and
confirmed the localization by genomic sequence analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

McPherson et al. (2004) used gene targeting to study the physiologic
requirements of Mus81 in mammals. Mus81-null mice were viable and
fertile, which indicates that mammalian Mus81 is not essential for
recombination processes associated with meiosis. Mus81-deficient mice
and cells were hypersensitive to the DNA crosslinking agent mitomycin C
but not to gamma-irradiation. Remarkably, both homozygous Mus81-null
mice and heterozygous Mus81 +/- mice exhibited a similar susceptibility
to spontaneous chromosomal damage and a profound and equivalent
predisposition to lymphomas and other cancers. McPherson et al. (2004)
concluded that their studies demonstrated a critical role for the proper
biallelic expression of the mammalian Mus81 in the maintenance of
genomic integrity and tumor suppression.

;;POSTSYNAPTIC DENSITY 95; PSD95;;
SYNAPSE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 90; SAP90
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DLG4 belongs to the discs large (DLG) subfamily of the
membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family (see DLG1; 601014).
DLG4 interacts with both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (see
138249) and Shaker-type potassium channels (see 176260) and plays an
important role in the formation and maintenance of synaptic junctions
(Zhou and Blumberg, 2003).

CLONING

Proteins related to Drosophila 'discs large' (Dlg) are associated with
the cortical actin cytoskeleton and appear to have both structural and
functional roles. By screening a human mammary gland cDNA library with a
human EST showing homology to rat Psd95, which is also known as Sap90
(Kistner et al., 1993), Stathakis et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA encoding
DLG4, which they called PSD95. The predicted 723-amino acid DLG4 protein
has 3 PSD95-DLG-Z01 (PDZ) domains in its N-terminal half, a central src
homology-3 (SH3) motif, and a C-terminal guanylate kinase
(GUK)-homologous domain. The human DLG4 protein is 99% identical to the
rat and mouse Psd95 proteins and 56% identical to the Drosophila Dlg
protein. Northern blot analysis detected 6 DLG4 transcripts with
different expression patterns, including a 4.2-kb transcript that was
variably expressed in all 17 human tissues examined. Western blot
analysis using antibodies against DLG4 detected multiple proteins with
complex distribution patterns, including a ubiquitous 85-kD and
tissue-specific variants.

By examining human brain, mammary gland, pancreas, and testis cDNA
libraries, Stathakis et al. (1999) identified 3 splice variants of DLG4.
A transcript lacking exon 3 was detected in brain, but not in other
tissues. This variant introduces an early frameshift and encodes a
predicted 45-amino acid peptide. However, a downstream ORF from exons 4
through 22 has the potential to encode a 664-amino acid protein
containing all functional domains of DLG4, with a single residue before
the first PDZ domain. A variant lacking exon 20 was detected in mammary
gland and testis, but not in brain or pancreas. This variant encodes a
deduced 670-amino acid protein that lacks part of the C-terminal GUK
domain. A variant containing a 99-nucleotide extension of exon 4 (exon
4b) was detected in testis, but not in other tissues. This variant
encodes a deduced 803-amino acid protein with 33 additional amino acids
inserted before the first PDZ domain.

Zhou and Blumberg (2003) stated that the N terminus of DLG4 is modified
by thioester-linked palmitate, which targets the protein to cell
membranes. Palmitoylation is also a critical regulatory mechanism for
receptor interactions with DLG4. Real-time RT-PCR detected DLG4
expression in all tissues examined, with highest expression in brain,
followed by heart, placenta, lung, pancreas, spleen, thymus, testis,
ovary, and small intestine.

GENE FUNCTION

The proper distribution of voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channels
on the neuronal surface is critical for the processing and transmission
of electrical signals in neurons. Kim et al. (1995) and Kim et al.
(1996) demonstrated that PSD95 and chapsyn-110 (603583) mediated
clustering of both NMDA receptors and potassium channels. Chapsyn-110
and PSD95 heteromultimerized with each other and were recruited into the
same NMDA receptor and potassium channel clusters. Kim et al. (1996)
suggested that these 2 proteins may interact at postsynaptic sites to
form a multimeric scaffold for the clustering of receptors, ion
channels, and associated signaling proteins.

In cultured cortical neurons, Sattler et al. (1999) suppressed
expression of the NMDA receptor scaffolding protein PSD95 and observed
selective attenuation of excitotoxicity triggered via NMDA receptors,
but not by other glutamate or calcium ion channels. NMDA receptor
function was unaffected because receptor expression, NMDA currents, and
calcium-45 loading were unchanged. Suppressing PSD95 blocked
calcium-activated nitric oxide production by NMDA receptors selectively
without affecting neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression or function.
Thus, PSD95 is required for efficient coupling of NMDAR activity to
nitric oxide toxicity and imparts specificity to excitotoxic calcium
signaling.

El-Husseini et al. (2000) found that overexpression of PSD95 in
hippocampal neurons could drive maturation of glutamatergic synapses.
PSD95 expression enhanced postsynaptic clustering and activity of
glutamate receptors. Postsynaptic expression of PSD95 also enhanced
maturation of the presynaptic terminal. These effects required synaptic
clustering of PSD95 but did not rely on its guanylate kinase domain.
PSD95 expression also increased the number and size of dendritic spines.
El-Husseini et al. (2000) concluded that PSD95 can orchestrate synaptic
development and suggested that PSD95 has a role in synapse stabilization
and plasticity.

Neuregulins and their receptors, the ERBB protein tyrosine kinases, are
essential for neuronal development, but their functions in the adult
central nervous system are unknown. Huang et al. (2000) reported that
ERBB4 (600543) is enriched in the postsynaptic density and associates
with PSD95. Heterologous expression of PSD95 enhanced NRG (142445)
activation of ERBB4 and MAP kinase (see 176948). Conversely, inhibiting
expression of PSD95 in neurons attenuated NRG-mediated activation of MAP
kinase. PSD95 formed a ternary complex with 2 molecules of ERBB4,
suggesting that PSD95 facilitates ERBB4 dimerization. Finally, NRG
suppressed induction of long-term potentiation in the hippocampal CA1
region without affecting basal synaptic transmission. Thus, NRG
signaling may be synaptic and regulated by PSD95. Huang et al. (2000)
concluded that a role of NRG signaling in the adult central nervous
system may be modulation of synaptic plasticity.

El-Husseini et al. (2002) identified palmitate cycling on PSD95 at the
synapse and found that palmitate turnover on PSD95 is regulated by
glutamate receptor activity. Acutely blocking palmitoylation dispersed
synaptic clusters of PSD95 and caused a selective loss of synaptic AMPA
receptors (e.g., GRIA1; 138248). The authors also found that rapid
glutamate-mediated AMPA receptor internalization requires
depalmitoylation of PSD95. In a nonneuronal model system, clustering of
PSD95, stargazin (602911), and AMPA receptors was also regulated by
ongoing palmitoylation of PSD95 at the plasma membrane. El-Husseini et
al. (2002) concluded that palmitate cycling on PSD95 can regulate
synaptic strength and activity-dependent plasticity.

To treat stroke without blocking NMDA receptors, Aarts et al. (2002)
transduced neurons with peptides that disrupted the interaction of NMDA
receptors with the postsynaptic density protein PSD95. This procedure
dissociated NMDA receptors from downstream neurotoxic signaling without
blocking synaptic activity or calcium influx. The peptides, when applied
either before or 1 hour after an insult, protected cultured neurons from
excitotoxicity, reduced focal ischemic brain damage in rats, and
improved their neurologic function. Aarts et al. (2002) concluded that
their approach circumvents the negative consequences associated with
blocking NMDA receptors and may constitute a practical stroke therapy.

In cotransfection experiments, Tanemoto et al. (2002) showed that Kir5.1
(KCNJ16; 605722) assembled to form a functional homomeric potassium
channel by interacting with PSD95. The authors observed that Kir5.1
expressed alone was distributed mostly in the cytoplasm, but Kir5.1
coexpressed with PSD95 was located on the plasma membrane in a clustered
manner. Using GST pull-down studies, Tanemoto et al. (2002) identified
domains responsible for Kir5.1/PSD95 interaction. They reported that
protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of Kir5.1 disrupted the
binding of Kir5.1 with PSD95. Tanemoto et al. (2002) hypothesized that
Kir5.1/PSD95 forms a functional brain potassium channel that may be a
physiologic target of PKA-mediated signaling. They concluded that PSD95
mediates formation of a functional potassium channel in the brain.

Conroy et al. (2003) showed that PDZ-containing proteins of the Psd95
family were required for maturation of functional nicotinic synapses in
embryonic chicken ciliary ganglia. These proteins also helped mediate
downstream activation of transcription factors.

Colledge et al. (2003) found that Psd95 interacted with and was
ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase Mdm2 (164785). In response to NMDA
receptor activation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, Psd95 was
ubiquitinated and rapidly removed from synaptic sites by
proteasome-dependent degradation. Mutations that blocked Psd95
ubiquitination prevented NMDA-induced AMPA receptor endocytosis.
Likewise, proteasome inhibitors prevented NMDA-induced AMPA receptor
internalization and synaptically induced long-term depression. Colledge
et al. (2003) concluded that ubiquitination of PSD95 through an
MDM2-mediated pathway regulates AMPA receptor surface expression during
synaptic plasticity.

Bao et al. (2004) found that sound-induced synaptic activity in the
mouse cochlea increased the level of nuclear neuregulin-1 intracellular
domain (Nrg-ICD) and upregulated PSD95 in postsynaptic spiral ganglion
neurons. Nrg-ICD enhanced the transcriptional activity of the PSD95
promoter by binding to Eos (606239), a zinc finger transcription factor.
The findings identified a molecular basis for activity-dependent
synaptic plasticity.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse brain cDNA library, Li et al.
(2006) found that Gng13 (607298) interacted with Psd95. Mutation
analysis showed that the interaction involved the third PDZ domain of
Psd95 and the C-terminal CAAX motif of Gng13. Coexpression of Gng13 with
its G protein partner, Gnb1 (139380), did not interfere with the
interaction. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the interaction
between Psd95 and Gng13.

Aartsen et al. (2006) found that Mpp4 -/- mouse retinas showed
downregulation of Psd95 and mislocalization of both Psd95 and Veli3
(LIN7C; 612332) at the photoreceptor presynaptic membrane. They proposed
that MPP4 may function as a recruitment factor to organize signal
transducers at the photoreceptor synapse.

Kim et al. (2007) showed that phosphorylation of Psd95 in rat
hippocampal neurons enhanced Psd95 synaptic accumulation and the ability
of Psd95 to recruit surface AMPA receptors and potentiate excitatory
postsynaptic currents. They determined that the Rac1 (602048)-Jnk1
(MAPK8; 601158) signaling pathway mediated this phosphorylation.
Overexpression of a phosphomimicking mutant of Psd95 inhibited
NMDA-induced AMPA receptor internalization and blocked induction of
long-term depression.

Using PSD95 inhibitors, which uncouple postsynaptic density protein
PSD95 from neurotoxic signaling pathways, in gyrencephalic nonhuman
primates (cynomolgus macaques), Cook et al. (2012) showed that stroke
damage can be prevented when a PSD95 inhibitor is administered after
stroke onset in clinically relevant situations. The treatment reduced
infarct volumes as gauged by MRI and histology, preserved the capacity
of ischemic cells to maintain gene transcription in genomewide screens
of ischemic brain tissue, and significantly preserved neurologic
function in neurobehavioral assays. The degree of tissue neuroprotection
by MRI corresponded strongly to the preservation of neurologic function,
supporting the intuitive but unproven dictum that integrity of brain
tissue can reflect functional outcome. Cook et al. (2012) concluded that
their findings established that tissue neuroprotection and improved
functional outcome after stroke is unequivocally achievable in
gyrencephalic nonhuman primates treated with PSD95 inhibitors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Stathakis et al. (1999) determined that the DLG4 gene contains 22 exons
and spans about 30 kb. All splice sites conform to the GT-AG rule,
except for the splice acceptor site of intron 5, which is TG instead of
AG. The promoter region contains no TATA or CAAT boxes, but has a large
GC-rich domain with characteristics of a CpG island.

Zhang et al. (2003) noted that the VLCAD (609575) and the DLG4 genes are
located in a head-to-head orientation on chromosome 17p. The transcribed
regions of the 2 genes overlap by about 220 bp. Using serial promoter
partial deletion constructs in a reporter gene assay, they found that
the essential promoter activity of DLG4 is carried within a region of
about 400 bp and covers the entire VLCAD minimal promoter, which spans
about 270 bp. The results from di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate
(DEHP)-treated HepG2 cells revealed that the minimal VLCAD promoter can
upregulate VLCAD expression in response to DEHP treatment. Site-directed
mutagenesis experiments showed that a mutated AP2 (107580)-binding site
markedly reduced the transcriptional activity of both the VLCAD and DLG4
promoters and abolished the minimal VLCAD promoter's response to DEHP
treatment.

Independently, Zhou and Blumberg (2003) determined that the VLCAD and
DLG4 genes overlap. The 2 genes share 245 nucleotides at their 5-prime
ends, and the transcription start site for DLG4 extends into the coding
region of VLCAD exon 1. The upstream regions of the VLCAD and DLG4
genes, including the overlapping region, contain 2 potential TATA-less
promoters with potential binding sites for several common transcription
factors. RT-PCR detected unique patterns of expression for VLCAD and
DLG4, indicating that, although they share common regulatory elements,
VLCAD and DLG4 also have distinct tissue-specific elements. The mouse
Dlg4 and Vlcad genes are oriented in a head-to-head manner, but they do
not overlap and are separated by almost 3.5 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid mapping, Stathakis et al. (1997) localized the DLG4
gene to chromosome 17p13.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Specific patterns of neuronal firing induce changes in synaptic strength
that may contribute to learning and memory. If the postsynaptic NMDA
receptors are blocked, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term
depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission and the learning of spatial
information are prevented. The NMDA receptor can bind PSD95, which may
regulate the localization of and/or signaling by the receptor. Migaud et
al. (1998) found that in mutant mice lacking Psd95, the frequency
function of NMDA-dependent LTP and LTD was shifted to produce strikingly
enhanced LTP at different frequencies of synaptic stimulation. In
keeping with neural-network models that incorporate bidirectional
learning rules, this frequency shift was accompanied by severely
impaired spatial learning. Synaptic NMDA-receptor currents, subunit
expression, localization, and synaptic morphology were all unaffected in
the mutant mice. PSD95 thus appears to be important in coupling the NMDA
receptor to pathways that control bidirectional synaptic plasticity and
learning.

Using microarray analysis, Yao et al. (2004) identified Psd95 among a
small number of genes whose expression was downregulated in Dat (SLC6A3;
126455) -/- mice, Net (SLC6A2; 163970) -/- mice, and Vmat2 (SLC18A2;
193001) +/- mice, all of which are models of dopamine supersensitivity,
as well as in mice chronically treated with cocaine. In all 4 models,
Psd95 mRNA and protein levels were downregulated in nucleus accumbens
and caudate putamen. Psd95 protein was also decreased specifically in
striatum, but not in cortex and hippocampus, of cocaine-treated animals.
Enhanced long-term potentiation of frontocortico-accumbal glutamatergic
synapses correlated with reduced Psd95 levels in all 4 models. Yao et
al. (2004) also found that Psd95 -/- mice were supersensitive to cocaine
and lacked chronic cocaine-induced behavioral plasticity.

Beique et al. (2006) found that Psd95-null mice had decreased glutamate
AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission but NMDA receptors were not
affected. Although most of the affected synapses were located on
morphologically mature dendritic spines, a significant population of
synapses appeared unaffected by Psd95 depletion, suggesting that the
functional role of Psd95 displays synapse specificity.

DESCRIPTION The bacterial enzyme 3-methyladenine (3MeA) DNA glycosylase repairs the
lethal lesion 3MeA that blocks DNA replication in Escherichia coli. The
removal of 3MeA is mediated by two 3MeA DNA glycosylases in E. coli,
encoded by the alkA and tag genes. Using a human cDNA library cloned
into a bacterial expression vector, Boosalis et al. (1991) cloned a
1.15-kb cDNA that rescued alkA(-) tag(-) glycosylase-deficient E. coli
from alkylation-induced killing, and produced a 5-fold increase in 3MeA
DNA glycosylase activity in the E. coli strain. The cDNA hybridized to
human genomic DNA but did not hybridize to E. coli or yeast DNA. DNA
sequence analysis defined an open reading frame coding for a 33-kD
protein that showed extensive amino acid homology with rat 3MeA DNA
glycosylase. The gene (designated N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase, MPG)
was mapped to human chromosome 16 by analysis of a panel of DNAs from
mouse/human and hamster/human hybrid cell lines. Samson et al. (1991)
suggested that because of the 85% identity of 1 part of the human
glycosylase with the middle of the rat glycosylase polypeptide and,
hence, the likely common origin of the rat and human glycosylases, the
human gene should be called AAG for 3-alkyladenine DNA glycosylase.
Vickers et al. (1993) also isolated a cDNA corresponding to the human
MPG gene. They showed that the gene comprises 5 exons and lies within a
group of closely spaced genes in the terminal region of chromosome 16p.
The MPG gene was expressed in all cell lines and tissues examined, but
was found at particularly high levels in a colon adenocarcinoma cell
line (HT29). The completely characterized human MPG gene was found to
span 7 to 8 kb of genomic DNA and to be localized 75 kb upstream of the
embryonic zeta-globin gene (HBZ; 142310).

Kielman et al. (1995) described the genomic organization of the mouse
Mpg gene. Preliminary analyses by Kielman et al. (1993) and Kielman et
al. (1994) indicated that as in the human, the gene is upstream of the
alpha-globin gene cluster on mouse chromosome 11.

The human enzyme 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase removes a diverse group
of damaged bases from DNA, including cytotoxic and mutagenic alkylation
adducts of purines. Lau et al. (1998) reported the crystal structure of
human 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase complexed to a mechanism-based
pyrrolidine inhibitor. The enzyme had intercalated into the minor groove
of DNA, causing the abasic pyrrolidine nucleotide to flip into the
enzyme active site, where a bound water was poised for nucleophilic
attack.

ANIMAL MODEL

By targeted homologous recombination, Engelward et al. (1997) generated
mice deficient in the 3MeA DNA glycosylase encoded by the Aag gene. In
several mouse tissues, the Aag gene product appears to be the only DNA
glycosylase that is active against 3MeA, hypoxanthine, and
1,N6-ethenoadenine. Although the Aag protein has the capacity to remove
8-oxoguanine DNA lesions, it does not appear to be the major glycosylase
for 8-oxoguanine repair.

To assess the contribution of Apng to the repair of several mutagenic
lesions in vivo, Hang et al. (1997) biochemically analyzed cell-free
extracts of tissues from mice with a targeted deletion of the Apng gene.
They found that both 1,N6-ethenoadenine and hypoxanthine are substrates
for Apng, but 3,N4-ethenocytosine and 8-oxoguanine are not.

Elder et al. (1998) developed mice deficient in
alkylpurine-DNA-N-glycosylase by targeted disruption. Following
treatment with DNA-methylating agents, increased persistence of
7-methylguanine (meG) was found in liver sections of APNG knockout mice
in comparison with wildtype mice, demonstrating an in vivo phenotype for
the APNG-null animals. Unlike other null mutants of the basic excision
repair pathway, the APNG knockout mice exhibited a very mild phenotype,
showed no outward abnormalities, were fertile, and had an apparently
normal life span. Neither a difference in the number of leukocytes in
peripheral blood nor a difference in the number of bone marrow
polychromatic erythrocytes was found when knockout and wildtype mice
were exposed to methylating or chloroethylating agents. Treatment with
methyl methanesulfonate resulted in 3- to 4-fold more HPRT (308000)
mutations in splenic T lymphocytes from APNG knockout mice than in those
from wildtype mice. These mutations were predominantly single-basepair
changes that most likely were caused by 3-meA and 3- or 7-meG,
respectively.

COMPLEMENT COMPONENT 1, q SUBCOMPONENT, GAMMA POLYPEPTIDE; C1QG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

C1q, the first subcomponent of C1, has a complicated 18-chain structure:
6 A, 6 B, and 6 C chains. Each chain has a stretch of about 80 amino
acids with the collagenous triplet Gly-X-Y where X and Y can include
hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine. The A (120550), B (120570), and C
chains combine to form 6 heteromeric triple helices in the collagenous
regions of the chains (Sellar et al., 1991).

MAPPING

Sellar et al. (1991) found that the genes encoding the A, B, and C
chains of human C1q are aligned, 5-prime to 3-prime, in the same
orientation in the order A-C-B on a 24-kb stretch of DNA on chromosome
1p. A and C are separated by 4 kb and B and C are separated by 11 kb.
Hybridization of cDNA probes to a hybrid cell line containing the
derived X chromosome from an X;1(q21.2;p34) translocation described in a
female patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Lindenbaum et al.,
1979; Boyd et al., 1988) showed that the A and B genes are located in
the region 1p36.3-p34.1 (Sellar et al., 1992).

GENE STRUCTURE

The A- (120550), B- (120570), and C-chain C1q genes are approximately
2.5, 2.6, and 3.2 kb long, respectively, and each contains 1 intron
located within a codon for a glycine residue found halfway along the
collagen-like region present in each chain. These glycine residues are
located just before the point where the triple-helical portions of the
C1q molecule appear to bend when viewed by electron microscopy. Southern
blot analysis showed that there is only one gene per chain.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with C1q deficiency (613652), Slingsby et al. (1996)
identified homozygous mutations in the C1QC gene
(120575.0001-120575.0003).

;;ARVP;;
VASOPRESSIN-NEUROPHYSIN II;;
ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE; ADH
NEUROPHYSIN II, INCLUDED; NPII, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The arginine vasopressin (AVP) gene encodes prepro-AVP, which consists
of a signal peptide, AVP, neurophysin II (NPII), and a glycoprotein,
copeptin (summary by Mahoney et al., 2002).

CLONING

Land et al. (1982) sequenced a cDNA clone that encoded bovine arginine
vasopressin-neurophysin II (AVP-NpII) precursor.

GENE FUNCTION

Sachs et al. (1969) suggested that arginine vasopressin and its
corresponding neurophysin are synthesized in the form of a common
precursor which is cleaved by proteolysis to yield the biologically
functional peptides. Rats with hereditary diabetes insipidus are
deficient in synthesis of both arginine vasopressin and one species of
neurophysin (Sunde and Sokol, 1975). Both of the nonapeptide hormones
arginine vasopressin and oxytocin (OXT; 167050) are synthesized in the
supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the
hypothalamus together with their respective 'carrier' proteins, the
neurophysins (Brownstein et al., 1980). Vasopressin and oxytocin are
produced by separate populations of magnocellular neurons in both
nuclei. Together with the neurophysins they are packaged into
neurosecretory vesicles and transported axonally to the nerve endings in
the neurohypophysis, where they are either stored or secreted into the
bloodstream. In addition to having 9 amino acids, each has a disulfide
bond between the cysteines at positions 1 and 6. Ganz et al. (1989)
provided evidence that the hormone regulates pH in the presence of
bicarbonate by stimulating 3 acid-base transport systems.

Gabreels et al. (1998) showed 7B2 (173120) immunoreactivity in the
supraoptic nucleus or the paraventricular nucleus in only 3 of 5
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) patients. In contrast with 5 other PWS
patients, the neurons in the hypothalamic SON and PVN of the two
7B2-immunonegative PWS patients also failed to show any reaction using 2
antibodies directed against processed vasopressin (VP). On the other
hand, even these 2 cases reacted normally with 5 antibodies that
recognize different parts of the VP precursor. This finding pointed to a
processing defect. The same patients had no PC2 (162151)
immunoreactivity in the SON or PVN, whereas PC1 (162150)
immunoreactivity was only slightly diminished. The authors concluded
that in the VP neurons of 2 PWS patients, the amounts of 7B2 and PC2
present are greatly reduced, resulting in diminished VP precursor
processing.

The PVN and the SON in the rat contain estrogen-regulated oxytocin and
arginine-vasopressin systems, but little or no estrogen receptor-alpha
(133430). Using estradiol-treated ovariectomized young adult
Sprague-Dawley rats and dual-labeled immunocytochemistry, Alves et al.
(1998) showed that OXT-ir (OXT-immunoreactivity) colocalized with
ESR-beta (601663)-ir in the parvicellular subnuclei of PVN but there was
little AVP-/ESR-beta-ir. In contrast, in the SON, most nuclear
ESR-beta-ir colocalized with AVP-ir, whereas few OXT-/ESR-beta-ir
dual-labeled cells were observed. These results suggested that estrogen
can directly modulate specific OXT and AVP systems through an
ESR-beta-mediated mechanism, in a tissue specific manner.

Growth hormone (GH; 139250) secretagogues (GHSs) act via specific
receptors in the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland to release GH (see
601898). GHSs also stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
axis via central mechanisms probably involving corticotropin-releasing
hormone (CRH; 122560) or AVP. Korbonits et al. (1999) studied the
effects of the GHS hexarelin, CRH, and desmopressin, an AVP analog, on
stimulation of the HPA axis in 15 healthy young male volunteers. They
concluded that the effect of GHSs on the HPA axis does not involve CRH,
but may occur through the stimulation of AVP release.

Tobin et al. (2010) reported that the rat olfactory bulb contains a
large population of interneurons which express vasopressin, that
blocking the actions of vasopressin in the olfactory bulb impairs the
social recognition abilities of rats, and that vasopressin agonists and
antagonists can modulate the processing of information by olfactory bulb
neurons. Tobin et al. (2010) concluded that social information is
processed in part by a vasopressin system intrinsic to the olfactory
system.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vasopressin is synthesized as a much larger precursor which
includes--besides the hormone--its carrier protein, neurophysin, and a
glycoprotein. The functional domains of the protein precursor are coded
by 3 exons separated by 2 introns. The first exon encodes the hormone,
the second most of the carrier protein, and the third the glycoprotein
(summary by Schmale et al., 1984).

Sausville et al. (1985) found that the genes for
prepro-arginine-vasopressin-neurophysin II (AVP) and
prepro-oxytocin-neurophysin I (OXT; 167050) have a similar intron-exon
structure, are linked (on chromosome 20) with 12 kb intervening DNA, and
are transcribed from opposite DNA strands. In a human small cell lung
cancer (182280) cell line, they found that the first but not the second
strand was actively transcribed.

MAPPING

The structural gene for AVP was assigned to chromosome 20 by means of a
gene probe in somatic cell hybrids (Riddell et al., 1985); the gene
probe was for arginine vasopressin/neurophysin II.

By use of a RFLP located near the ARVP/OXT complex, Summar et al. (1990)
accumulated linkage data showing that the AVP and OXT genes are located
on the distal short arm of chromosome 20 about 15 cM toward the telomere
from the D20S5 locus, which is located near the middle of the short arm
of 20p12.21. Thus, the location of the gene can be stated as
20pter-p12.21. The mapping of the neighboring gene OXT to 20p13 by both
isotopic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (Gopal Rao et al., 1992)
means that AVP is also in band 20p13.

In the mouse, Marini et al. (1993) noted that Avp and Oxt are separated
by only 3.5 kb of intergenic sequence. By interspecific backcross
analysis, they mapped this pair of genes to mouse chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ito et al. (1991) showed that central diabetes insipidus (125700) was
caused by a gly57-to-ser substitution (192340.0001) of the AVP gene in 2
patients.

Rittig et al. (1996) identified 13 new mutations in the AVP gene in 17
unrelated kindreds with familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus.
They sequenced all 3 exons of the gene by using a rapid, direct
dye-terminator method and found the site of mutation in each case. Four
of the mutations had been described previously. There were 2 missense
mutations that altered the cleavage region of the signal peptide, 7
missense mutations in exon 2, which codes for the conserved portion of
the protein, 1 nonsense mutation in exon 2, and 3 nonsense mutations in
exon 3. The affected individuals were heterozygous for the mutations as
expected in this autosomal dominant disorder.

Repaske et al. (1996) examined the AVP gene in 3 unrelated kindreds with
autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus. They identified
3 different mutations, each of which represented a recurrence of a
previously described mutation. All 3 were transitions; 2 occurred in the
NPII moiety and 1 in the last amino acid at the C terminus of the signal
peptide. To determine if these apparent recurrent mutations arose
independently rather than from ancestral founder mutations, Repaske et
al. (1996) examined family origins, polymorphic markers on chromosome 20
in close proximity to AVP, and/or the occurrence of a de novo mutation
in these 3 families and compared the data to 4 previously reported
families. The results suggested that the mutations probably arose
independently in 2 of the 3 families but that 1 family may share an
ancestral founder mutation with a previously reported family.

Christensen et al. (2004) screened for mutations in the AVP gene in 1 or
more affected members of 15 unrelated kindreds in which diabetes
insipidus appeared to be segregating. In each of 6 kindreds, they
identified a unique novel mutation, 2 in the translation initiation
codon of the AVP pre-prohormone signal peptide and 4 that predict
substitutions in the NPII moiety of the AVP prohormone. In the other 9
kindreds, 7 different previously described mutations were identified.
Christensen et al. (2004) suggested that mutations in the AVP gene
causing familial central diabetes insipidus affect amino acid residues
known or presumed to be important for the proper folding and/or
dimerization of the NPII moiety of the AVP prohormone.

Ito et al. (1997) expressed wildtype and different mutant AVP genes in
neuro2A neuroblastoma cells. When cells were treated with valproic acid
to induce neuronal differentiation, each of the mutants caused reduced
viability. Metabolic labeling revealed diminished intracellular
trafficking of mutant AVP precursors and confirmed inefficient secretion
of immunoreactive AVP. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated marked
accumulation of mutant AVP precursors within the endoplasmic reticulum.
These studies suggested that the cellular toxicity in familial
neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus may be caused by the intracellular
accumulation of mutant precursor proteins.

To elucidate the mechanism of neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus,
Nijenhuis et al. (1999) stably expressed 5 vasopressin prohormones with
a mutation in the neurophysin moiety in 2 neuroendocrine cell lines. The
mutations studied included G57S (192340.0001) and G65V (192340.0008).
Metabolic labeling demonstrated that the processing and secretion of all
5 mutants was impaired, albeit to different extents, the impairment
being greatest in G65V and least in G57S. Persisting endoglycosidase H
sensitivity showed that these defects were associated with retention of
mutant prohormone in the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutant prohormones that
partially passed the endoplasmic reticulum were normally targeted to the
regulated secretory pathway. This also included mutants with mutations
in residues involved in binding of vasopressin to neurophysin, a process
implicated in targeting of the prohormone. To mimic the high expression
in vasopressin-producing neurons, mutant vasopressin prohormones were
transiently expressed in one of the 2 neuroendocrine cell lines.
Immunofluorescence displayed formation of large accumulations of mutant
prohormone in the endoplasmic reticulum, accompanied by redistribution
of an endoplasmic reticulum marker. The data suggested that prolonged
perturbation of the endoplasmic reticulum eventually leads to
degeneration of neurons expressing mutant vasopressin prohormones,
explaining the dominant nature of the disease.

Christensen et al. (2004) compared the cellular handling of the
recessive P26L (see 192340.0016) and dominant Y21H (see 192340.0018)
prohormones and demonstrated that the recessive mutation does not seem
to affect the intracellular trafficking but rather the final processing
of the prohormone. The authors determined that their results provided an
important negative control in support of the hypothesis that autosomal
dominant inheritance of familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus is
caused by mutations in the AVP gene that alter amino acids important for
folding and/or dimerization of the neurophysin II moiety of the AVP
prohormone and subsequent transport from the endoplasmic reticulum.

ANIMAL MODEL

A single-nucleotide deletion is found in the second exon in the
Brattleboro rat with diabetes insipidus (Schmale et al., 1984). Diabetes
insipidus in the Brattleboro rat is autosomal recessive (Valtin et al.,
1965); in man, a recessive form is probably a rarity (see 125800). In
studies of the homozygous (di/di) Brattleboro rat with severe diabetes
insipidus, Evans et al. (1994) found evidence indicating that
nondividing neurons can be subject to somatic mutations at high
frequency. They reported specific frameshift mutations occurring in
postmitotic neurons. The mutations were identified in vasopressin
transcripts in magnocellular neurons of the homozygous rats and
consisted predominantly of a GA deletion in GAGAG motifs.
Immunocytochemistry provided evidence for similar events in wildtype
rats. However, the diseased state of the Brattleboro rat, resulting in a
permanent activation of vasopressin neurons, enhanced the mutation rate.

In Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300) and Down syndrome (190685) patients,
van Leeuwen et al. (1998) demonstrated the cellular colocalization of
truncated forms of ubiquitin-B (UBB; 191339) and beta-amyloid precursor
protein (APP; 104760) and involvement with a similar type of mutation
operating at the transcriptional level or by posttranscriptional editing
of RNA. They suggested that transcript mutation may be a widely
occurring phenomenon. The frequently mutated motif in exon 9 of the APP
gene transcript (GAGAGAGA) is an extended version of the GAGAG motif of
the AVP transcript that is frequently involved in a GA dinucleotide
deletion in the homozygous Brattleboro rat.

DIABETES INSIPIDUS, NEUROHYPOPHYSEAL
AVP, GLY57SER

In 2 patients with central diabetes insipidus (125700) from a pedigree
consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance, Ito et al. (1991) used
PCR to amplify fragments including the promoter region and all coding
regions from genomic DNA. Direct sequencing showed that 1 of the 2 ARVP
genes contained a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1859 in the second
exon, resulting in substitution of serine for glycine at amino acid
position 57 in the neurophysin II moiety of the gene. Ito et al. (1991)
also sequenced the AVP-NPII gene in 10 patients with idiopathic central
diabetes insipidus, of whom 5 had juvenile onset. No difference in
sequence was found compared with normal subjects. Autoimmunity has been
proposed as one cause of idiopathic diabetes insipidus (Scherbaum and
Bottazzo, 1983).

DIABETES INSIPIDUS, NEUROHYPOPHYSEAL
AVP, GLY17VAL

In a Dutch family in which autosomal dominant diabetes insipidus
(125700) could be traced back for 5 generations, Bahnsen et al. (1992)
identified a G-to-T transversion within the neurophysin-encoding exon B,
which converted a highly conserved glycine (gly17 of neurophysin) to a
valine residue.

Olias et al. (1996) examined whether this point mutation affects the
processing and transport of the vasopressin-neurophysin precursor. They
stably expressed the normal and mutant vasopressin cDNAs under the
control of the cytomegalovirus promoter in the mouse pituitary cell line
AtT20. The mutant precursor was synthesized, but processing and
secretion were dramatically reduced compared to the normal. The mutant
neurophysin staining was restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum and
never reached the trans-Golgi network, whereas the normal neurophysin
concentrated in the tips of the cell processes where secretory granules
accumulate. These results suggested that the mutation alters the
conformation of the precursor, impairs its intracellular transport, and
triggers its retention.

AVP, ALA-1THR

In 23 individuals with central diabetes insipidus (125700) spanning 4
generations of a Japanese family, Ito et al. (1993) discovered a G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 279 in exon 1 of the ARVP gene, causing
substitution of thr (ACG) for ala (GCG) at -1 position (A-1T), the
carboxy end, of the signal peptide of prepro-VP. They suggested that
insufficient processing of prepro-VP produced by the mutant allele is
involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes insipidus in this family. A
similar defect in cleavage by signal peptidase occurs in factor X (Santo
Domingo) with resulting bleeding diathesis (227600.0005). Similarly, a
point mutation in the signal peptide-encoding region of the PTH gene has
been demonstrated as the cause of familial isolated hypoparathyroidism
(168450.0001). Precisely the same mutation was found by McLeod et al.
(1993) in a Caucasian American kindred with 14 affected members. The
mutation was also found in 2 infants in whom AVP was normal when tested
at 6 and 9 months of age. This led McLeod et al. (1993) to hypothesize
that a mutation in exon 1 of the AVP-neurophysin-II gene causes
neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus by making an abnormally processed
precursor that gradually destroys vasopressinergic neurons. Krishnamani
et al. (1993) found the same mutation in 15 members of a 4-generation
family, some members of which were reported by Doherty-Fuller and
Copeland (1988).

Siggaard et al. (1999) carried out genetic analysis and clinical studies
of AVP secretion, urinary AVP, and urine output in 16 affected and 16
unaffected family members and 11 spouses of a Danish kindred with
neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus who carried the A-1T mutation.
Mutant cDNA carrying the same mutation was expressed in a neurogenic
cell line, and the cellular effects were studied by Western blot
analysis, immunocytochemistry, and AVP measurements. Clinical studies
showed a severe progressive deficiency of plasma and urinary AVP that
manifested during childhood. Expression studies demonstrated that the
A-1T mutant cells produced 8-fold less AVP than wildtype cells and
accumulated excessive amounts of 23-kD NPII protein corresponding to
uncleaved prepro-AVP-NPII. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the
intracellular AVP-NPII precursor appeared to be colocalized with an
endoplasmic reticulum antigen (Grp78). The authors concluded that the
A-1T mutation produces neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus by directing
the production of a mutant preprohormone that accumulates in the
endoplasmic reticulum, because it cannot be cleaved from the signal
peptide and transported to neurosecretory vesicles for further
processing and secretion.

AVP, 3-BP DEL, NT1824

In a family with central diabetes insipidus (125700) in an autosomal
dominant pedigree pattern, Yuasa et al. (1993) demonstrated a 3-bp
deletion (AGG) out of 2 consecutive AGG sequences (nucleotides
1824-1829) in 1 AVP allele. Cosegregation of the mutation with the DI
phenotype in the family was confirmed by restriction enzyme analyses.
The mutation was predicted to yield an abnormal AVP precursor lacking
glu47 (E47) in its neurophysin-II moiety. Since glu47 (E47) is essential
for NP molecules to form a salt bridge with AVP, the function of NP as a
carrier protein for AVP would be impaired. As a result, AVP probably
undergoes accelerated proteolytic degradation.

To determine whether the clinical course of autosomal dominant NDI is
compatible with the hypothesis that the neuropathologic findings are
attributable to a progressive loss of magnocellular neurons beginning in
early life, Mahoney et al. (2002) performed posterior pituitary magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and water deprivation tests, including plasma
adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) measurements, on 17 affected members of a
kindred with the delta-E47 neurophysin mutation whose ages ranged from 3
months to 54 years. Nine adult unaffected members aged 20 to 56 years
underwent these tests as controls. All 6 children undergoing MRI
demonstrated a posterior pituitary hyperintense signal (PPHS). Eight of
9 affected adults showed an absent or barely visible PPHS, whereas 8 of
9 age-matched unaffected adults produced a normal size PPHS. During
water deprivation tests, infants concentrated their urine normally, and
a 3-month-old infant produced a high plasma AVP level of 15.7
pmol/liter. By school age, affected children were no longer able to
concentrate their urine or prevent hypernatremia. Affected adults became
dehydrated; their median plasma AVP level was less than 1.0 pmol/liter,
but their median fasting plasma ACTH was 2-fold greater than the level
of unaffected adults (10.0 vs 5.0 pmol/liter; P = 0.008). The authors
concluded that autosomal dominant NDI is a progressive disease
associated with chronic loss of the magnocellular neurons that supply
AVP to the posterior pituitary but preservation of the parvocellular
neurons that supply AVP and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH;
122560) to the median eminence and stimulate ACTH production during
hypernatremia.

AVP, CYS67TER

In a Japanese pedigree with familial central diabetes insipidus
(125700), Nagasaki et al. (1995) demonstrated a TGC-to-TGA transition at
nucleotide position 1891 that generated a cys67-to-ter (C67X) change. As
the premature termination eliminated part of the COOH domain of the NPII
moiety and the glycoprotein moiety, the conformation of the protein was
probably markedly changed. A history of diabetes insipidus was obtained
in 3 members of the family spanning 3 generations.

Russell et al. (2003) established a murine knockin model of the human
C67X mutation. Heterozygous mice exhibited polyuria and polydipsia by 2
months of age, and these features of diabetes insipidus progressively
worsened with age. In addition, Avp gene products were not detected in
the neuronal projections, suggesting retention of wildtype and mutant
AVP precursors within the cell bodies. This murine model recapitulated
many features of the human disorder and demonstrated that expression of
the mutant AVP precursor leads to progressive neuronal cell loss, a
'dominant-negative' effect.

In a Japanese kindred with familial central diabetes insipidus (125700),

Rutishauser et al. (1996) identified a novel single base deletion (G227)
in the translation initiation codon of the AVP signal peptide in a
3-generation kindred with familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus
(125700). The mutation deletes nucleotide 227, the third base of the
initiation codon (ATG), and this may cause alternative use of an ATG
which is 4 triplets downstream. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies
showed the 'bright spot' that is characteristic of the posterior
pituitary in 2 unaffected family members whereas this was absent in all
4 affected family members studied. This absence may reflect the
deficient posterior pituitary function.

In a Japanese family with familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus
(125700), Ueta et al. (1996) found a G-to-T transversion of nucleotide
1884 in exon 2, resulting in a gly65-to-val substitution in the AVP
gene. (Note: the authors stated incorrectly in the abstract that the
substitution was 'glycine (Gly) for valine (Val)'.) To examine the
presence of this mutation in affected subjects, they designed 2 mutated
primers: by PCR amplification, 1 of the primers induced a new
endonuclease restriction site in the PCR fragment from normal persons,
while the other induced a different endonuclease restriction site from
patients with the mutation. Subsequently, restriction analysis of PCR
fragments and sequencing of genomic DNA indicated that affected subjects
were heterozygous for normal and mutant alleles.

AVP, ALA-1VAL

Repaske et al. (1997) identified a C-to-T transition in exon 1 of the
AVP gene causing an ala280-to-val substitution in the coding sequence
for the C terminus of the signal peptide (-1 amino acid) of the
prepro-AVP-NPII precursor in 2 independent families with autosomal
dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (125700). This mutation
predicts the complete inability of signal peptidase to cleave the signal
peptide from the preproprecursor and supports the hypothesis that the
progressive neurodegeneration that underlies neurohypophyseal diabetes
insipidus is caused by accumulation of malprocessed precursor.
Considerable heterogeneity in the age of onset (1 to 28 years of age)
and the severity of diabetes insipidus among affected members of these 2
families suggested that additional factors modulate the rate and extent
of progression of the neurodegeneration that results from this specific
mutation.

Heppner et al. (1998) found the same mutation in 2 children of an
affected father. Both children had onset of symptoms by 1 year of age.

In a girl with familial central diabetes insipidus (125700) who
presented at 9 months of age, and in her similarly affected younger
brother and father, Gagliardi et al. (1997) identified a 1758G-T
transversion in the AVP gene, resulting in a gly23-to-val substitution
in NPII. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the father's
pituitary gland showed an attenuated posterior pituitary bright spot.
The authors concluded that studies of this mutation may be useful in
developing models of dominantly inherited neurodegeneration because the
early age of onset of symptoms suggests that this mutation may be
particularly deleterious to the magnocellular neuron.

In all affected individuals of a Spanish kindred with familial
neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus, Calvo et al. (1999) identified
heterozygosity for a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1757 of the AVP
gene, resulting in a gly23-to-arg substitution in the NPII domain. The
substitution was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis.
Additionally, one of the asymptomatic relatives, an 8-month-old girl,
was identified as being heterozygous for the same mutation and developed
the disease 3 months later.

Calvo et al. (1998) analyzed 2 families with familial neurohypophyseal

novel nonsense mutation in exon 3 of the AVP gene, consisting in a
G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 2101, which produces a stop signal in
codon 82 (glu) of NPII. The premature termination eliminates part of the
C-terminal domain of NPII, including a cysteine residue in position 85,
which may be involved in correct folding of the prohormone. In the
second family, heterozygosity for a 279G-A transition resulting in a
change of alanine to threonine at position -1 of the signal peptide
(192340.0003) was observed in all affected individuals.

Grant et al. (1998) identified 2 novel mutations of the AVP gene in 2
kindreds with familial diabetes insipidus (125700). In each kindred, the
inheritance of the diabetes insipidus phenotype was consistent with an
autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The proband and 2 other members
of 1 kindred were heterozygous for a C-to-T transition at nucleotide
1857, predicting a ser-to-phe substitution at residue 56 of the
vasopressin-related neurophysin peptide encoded by the mutant allele.
The proband of the other kindred was heterozygous for a G-to-A

In a consanguineous Palestinian family with neurohypophyseal diabetes
insipidus (125700), Willcutts et al. (1999) identified a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 301 (C301T) in exon 1 of the AVP gene,
replacing proline-7 of mature AVP with leucine (Leu-AVP). All 3 affected
children were homozygous for the mutation, and the parents were
heterozygous. The authors determined that Leu-AVP is a weak agonist with
approximately 30-fold reduced binding to the human V2 receptor. Serum
Leu-AVP levels were elevated in all 3 children and further increased
during water deprivation to as high as 30 times normal, as measured by
radioimmunoassay. The youngest child (2 years old) was only mildly
affected, but had Leu-AVP levels similar to her severely affected
8-year-old brother, suggesting to the authors that unknown mechanisms
may partially compensate for a deficiency of active AVP in very young
children.

Christensen et al. (2004) investigated the cellular handling of the P26L
prohormone (P7L in the mature AVP protein) by heterologous expression in
neurogenic and neuronal cell lines. Secretion of P26L prohormone was
unaffected compared to wildtype prohormone. Confocal laser scanning
microscopy showed localization of the P26L prohormone and/or processed
products in secretory granules in the cellular processes. Christensen et
al. (2004) concluded that the recessive P26L mutation does not seem to
affect intracellular trafficking but rather the final processing of the
AVP prohormone.

In a Dutch family in which familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus
(125700) had been diagnosed, Abbes et al. (2000) identified a cysteine
(TGC)-to-glycine (GGC) substitution at codon 116 of the AVP gene.
Nijenhuis et al. (2001) analyzed the intracellular transport of the
mutant vasopressin prohormone in stably transfected cell lines that
contained a regulated secretory pathway. Nijenhuis et al. (2001)
referred to the mutation as NP85C-G. In 2 children from this kindred
they found that growth retardation was an important early sign that
responded to substitution therapy with 1-desamino-8-D-arginine
vasopressin. To obtain clues about the basis for the dominant
inheritance of familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus, they
analyzed the trafficking and processing of the mutant vasopressin
prohormone in cell lines by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation.
The mutant vasopressin prohormone was retained in the endoplasmic
reticulum and thus was not processed to vasopressin. The defect was not
caused by dimerization of the vasopressin prohormone via its unpaired
cysteine residue. High-level expression of the mutant vasopressin
prohormone in cell lines resulted in strong accumulation in the
endoplasmic reticulum and an altered morphology of this organelle. The
authors hypothesized that disturbance of the endoplasmic reticulum
results in dysfunction and ultimately cell death of the cells expressing
the mutant prohormone.

Rittig et al. (2002) reported a 3-generation Turkish kindred in which
severe familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (125700)
cosegregated with a novel missense mutation in the part of the AVP-NPII
gene encoding the AVP moiety. A heterozygous T-to-C transition at
position 285 in the genomic sequence predicted a tyr2-to-his (Y2H)
substitution. Like other mutations in the AVP gene that result in
diabetes insipidus, this substitution was expected to impair folding and
processing of the precursor, in this case by interfering with normal
binding of the AVP and NPII moieties. It was associated clinically with
inability to concentrate urine during fluid deprivation, a greater than
80% deficiency of AVP secretion, and absence of the posterior pituitary
bright spot on magnetic resonance imaging.

Christensen et al. (2004) investigated the cellular handling of the Y21H
prohormone (Y2H in the mature AVP protein) by heterologous expression in
neurogenic and neuronal cell lines. Immunoprecipitation demonstrated
retarded processing and secretion of the Y21H prohormone. Confocal laser

substitution (V67A). The authors noted that the mutation affects a
region of NPII unaffected by known AVP mutations and produces only a
minor change in the protein. They also noted that the inheritance
pattern was atypical and suggested incomplete penetrance. The proband
apparently inherited the disease through his affected mother, although
allegedly neither of his maternal grandparents had a history of
polyuria, but a brother of the maternal grandmother was affected.

In an American kindred with autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes

nucleotides in exon 1 of the AVP gene, either CTT or TTC, resulting in
deletion of the phenylalanine at codon 3 (F3del). The index patient was
a 78-year-old man noted to have hypotonic polyuria after a surgical
procedure. He had experienced polyuria and polydipsia since childhood
but had avoided medical attention by assiduously maintaining access to
water at all times. His family had recognized that some members required
large volumes of water, and to accommodate these individuals (known in
the family as 'water dogs'), a number of extra wells had been dug on the
family farm. Neuro 2A cells stably transfected with the mutant AVP-NP
construct showed increased rates of apoptosis as assessed by flow
cytometric methods. These observations supported the concept that
cellular toxicity of abnormal AVP-NP gene products underlies the
development of ADNDI, and the data further demonstrated that mutations
affecting the AVP moiety can result in initiation of these pathologic
processes.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The P518 precursor protein can be processed into several RF
(arg-phe)-amide peptides, including P518. RF-amide peptides share a
common C-terminal motif and are involved in cell signaling through G
protein-coupled receptors (Jiang et al., 2003).

CLONING

By searching a database for genes encoding RF-amide peptides, followed
by PCR of a kidney cDNA library, Jiang et al. (2003) cloned the P518
precursor gene. The deduced 126-amino acid protein contains a putative
N-terminal 22-amino acid signal peptide and no transmembrane domain,
suggesting that the protein or cleavage products can be secreted. The
26-amino acid P518 peptide sequence is located at the C terminus of the
precursor protein. Quantitative PCR detected significant expression of
P518 precursor mRNA in several specific brain regions, particularly in
cerebellum, medulla, retina, and vestibular nucleus. In peripheral
tissues, P518 precursor mRNA was detected in prostate, testis, colon,
thyroid, parathyroid, coronary artery, and bladder.

By searching for sequences similar to frog 26RFA, Chartrel et al. (2003)
identified human and rat cDNAs encoding prepro-26RFA. The deduced
136-amino acid human protein contains a 17-amino acid signal peptide,
followed by a dibasic processing site (arg-arg) and the 26RFA sequence,
which is identical to the P518 peptide sequence reported by Jiang et al.
(2003), at the C terminus. The human proprotein contains an additional
putative RF-amide peptide of 9 amino acids upstream of the 26RFA region
that is not found in rat.

By database analysis and RT-PCR of human brain RNA, Fukusumi et al.
(2003) isolated a cDNA encoding QRFP precursor protein. The 43-amino
acid QRFP peptide is located at the C terminus of the 136-amino acid
precursor protein.

Using in situ hybridization analysis in mouse brains, Takayasu et al.
(2006) demonstrated that QRFP is expressed exclusively in the
periventricular and lateral hypothalamus.

GENE FUNCTION

Jiang et al. (2003) found that the P518 peptide functioned as a
high-affinity ligand of GPR103 (606925) in GPR103-transfected human
embryonic kidney cells. The ability of P518 to mobilize intracellular
Ca(2+) via GPR103 appeared to be coupled to the G-alpha-q (GNAQ; 600998)
signaling pathway. In a human tissue RNA panel, both GPR103 and P518
precursor mRNA exhibited highest expression in brain, but their
expression in peripheral tissues was more divergent.

Chartrel et al. (2003) found that 26RFA induced a dose-dependent
stimulation of cAMP production by rat pituitary cells in vitro and
markedly increased food intake in mice.

In studies in CHO cells, Fukusumi et al. (2003) demonstrated that the
43-amino acid QRFP peptide was necessary to exhibit full agonistic
activity with GPR103. Intravenous administration of human QRFP into rats
caused release of aldosterone, suggesting that QRFP regulates adrenal
function.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the P518
precursor gene to chromosome 9 (TMAP RH48985).

ANIMAL MODEL

Takayasu et al. (2006) showed that QRFP administered centrally in mice
induced feeding behavior accompanied by increased general locomotor
activity and metabolic rate, as well as highly sustained elevations of
blood pressure and heart rate. QRFP-induced food intake was abolished by
preadministration of a specific antagonist for neuropeptide Y receptor
Y1 (162641). Hypothalamic prepro-QRFP mRNA expression was upregulated
upon fasting and in genetically obese ob/ob and db/db mice. Takayasu et
al. (2006) suggested that QRFP and GPR103 may regulate diverse
neuroendocrine and behavioral functions, and that this neuropeptide
system may be involved in metabolic syndrome (605552).

;;CALCIUM PLACENTAL PROTEIN; CAPL;;
FIBROBLAST-SPECIFIC PROTEIN 1; FSP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

S100 proteins, such as S100A4, are small, acidic calcium-binding
proteins that transduce Ca(2+)-signals via interaction with
intracellular target proteins (Mandinova et al., 1998).

CLONING

Engelkamp et al. (1992) cloned S100A4, which they called CAPL, from a
human heart cDNA library. The deduced 101-amino acid protein has the
domain structure of an S100 protein, with N- and C-terminal hydrophobic
regions and 2 central calcium loops. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous expression of a 650-bp transcript, with highest expression in
thymus, lung, and heart.

Ambartsumian et al. (1995) described 2 alternative splice variants of
S100A4 that differ in their 5-prime untranslated regions.

Using immunofluorescence analysis and confocal laser scanning
microscopy, Mandinova et al. (1998) showed that S100A1 (176940), S100A2
(176993), S100A4, and S100A6 (114110) localized to distinct
intracellular compartments in cultured human vascular and intestinal
smooth muscle cells. S100A1 and S100A4 were associated predominantly
with the sarcoplasmic reticulum and with actin stress fibers.

GENE FUNCTION

Mandinova et al. (1998) showed that elevated cytosolic Ca(2+) led to
relocalization of S100A1, S100A4, and S100A6 from sarcoplasmic reticulum
to vesicle-like structures around the nucleus in human vascular smooth
muscle cells. The localization of stress fiber-associated S100A1 and
S100A4 remained unchanged.

Fernandez-Fernandez et al. (2005) found that S100B (176990) and S100A4
bound the C-terminal tetramerization domain of p53 (191170) when the
domain was exposed in lower oligomerization states, disrupting p53
tetramerization. S100B bound to the negative regulatory and nuclear
localization domains of p53, resulting in very tight binding. Because
trafficking of p53 depends on its oligomerization state,
Fernandez-Fernandez et al. (2005) proposed that S100B and S100A4 may
regulate subcellular localization of p53 but with different effects on
p53 function in cell cycle control due to their differences in binding
p53.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ambartsumian et al. (1995) showed that the S100A4 gene consists of 4
exons.

MAPPING

Jackson-Grusby et al. (1987) isolated a probe for the mouse placental
protein for which the human equivalent was symbolized CAPL by van
Heyningen et al. (1989). By Southern blot analysis of DNAs from somatic
cell hybrids, van Heyningen et al. (1989) and Dorin et al. (1990) showed
that the CAPL gene in man cosegregates with CAGA (123885), CAGB
(123886), and calcyclin (114110). In the hands of van Heyningen et al.
(1989), Southern blot analysis of DNA from BxD recombinant inbred strain
mice showed a TaqI polymorphism for CAPL probe 18A2 to distinguish the
parental strains. CAPL cosegregated in the BxD mice with a fifth member
of this gene family, the p11 protein (mouse symbol Cal11) which had been
mapped to chromosome 3 by Saris et al. (1987). In the mouse Capl is
within 8 kb of Cacy; thus, by homology, the CAPL gene in man is probably
in region 1q21-q25 where the CACY gene has been mapped.

Schafer et al. (1995) isolated a YAC clone from the 1q21 region on which
9 different genes coding for S100 calcium-binding proteins could be
localized. The clustered organization of S100 genes allowed introduction
of a new logical nomenclature based on their physical arrangement on the
chromosome, with S100A1 (176940) being closest to the telomere and
S100A9 being closest to the centromere. In this revised nomenclature,
CAPL became S100A4.

;;HEAT-SHOCK 40-KD PROTEIN 2; HSPF2;;
MCG18
DESCRIPTION The E. coli heat-shock protein DnaJ is the founding member of a family
of proteins that are associated with protein folding, complex assembly,
and export. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic DnaJ homologs contain an
approximately 70-amino acid J domain, which is thought to mediate
interaction with 70-kD heat-shock proteins (e.g., 603012). During
sequence characterization of the VEGFB (601398) promoter region in
11q13, Silins et al. (1997) identified an EST corresponding to the
3-prime untranslated region of a novel gene, HSPF2, which they named
MCG18 for 'multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 candidate gene-18.'
Silins et al. (1998) sequenced the HSPF2 gene from a cosmid and
identified additional HSPF2 ESTs. The HSPF2 gene is located
approximately 250 bp centromeric of the VEGFB gene. The HSPF2 coding
sequence is contained in 5 exons. The deduced 241-amino acid HSPF2
protein has a J domain followed by a predicted transmembrane domain. The
human and mouse HSPF2 proteins are 71% identical. Northern blot analysis
detected an approximately 1.4-kb HSPF2 transcript in all human cell
lines examined.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TFE3, a member of the helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors,
binds to the mu-E3 motif of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer and
is expressed in many cell types (Henthorn et al., 1991).

CLONING

Macchi et al. (1995) cloned the TFE3 gene. They corrected the earlier
cDNA sequence and showed that the predicted protein is 371 amino acids
long and more similar to the mouse protein of 326 amino acids than had
been previously reported.

GENE STRUCTURE

Macchi et al. (1995) showed that the TFE3 gene consists of 7 exons. The
activation domain is in exon 2, the leucine zipper in exon 6, and the
basic helix-loop-helix motif occurs from exons 4 to 6.

MAPPING

Henthorn et al. (1991) localized the TFE3 gene to the proximal short arm
of the X chromosome using a somatic cell hybrid panel. A frequent RsaI
RFLP detected by the TFE3 cDNA was found and used to confirm this
location by linkage analysis, which placed TFE3 near markers in Xp11.22.
In the course of high-resolution comparative mapping of the proximal
region of the mouse X chromosome, Blair et al. (1995) mapped the Tfe3
gene to the same region as the Gata1 gene (305371).

GENE FUNCTION

Using an expression cloning strategy, Nakagawa et al. (2006) identified
TFE3 as a transactivator of metabolic genes that are regulated through
an E box in their promoters. Adenovirus-mediated expression of TFE3 in
hepatocytes in culture and in vivo strongly activated expression of
insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS2; 600797) and AKT (164730) and
enhanced phosphorylation of insulin-signaling kinases such as AKT,
glycogen synthase kinase-3-beta (605004), and p70S6 kinase (see 608939).
TFE3 also induced hexokinase II (HK2; 601125) and insulin-induced gene-1
(INSIG1; 602055). These changes led to metabolic consequences such as
activation of glycogen and protein synthesis, but not lipogenesis, in
liver. Collectively, plasma glucose levels were markedly reduced both in
normal mice and in different mouse models of diabetes. Activation of
insulin signals in both insulin depletion and resistance suggested that
TFE3 could be a therapeutic target for diabetes.

CYTOGENETICS

Translocations involving Xp11.2 have been found in synovial sarcoma and
in a subgroup of renal adenocarcinomas, namely, papillary renal cell
carcinoma (RCCX1; 300854) (Meloni et al., 1993). Of particular interest
is the similar localization of the breakpoints within Xp11 despite the
distinct histologic origin. Sinke et al. (1993) undertook to define the
precise location of the translocations in the 2 cases, making use of
tumor-derived interspecies somatic cell hybrids in conjunction with
Southern blot analysis. The resulting mapping data made it possible to
distinguish between the 2 translocations, to review the physical map of
the proximal Xp region, and to provide a basis for the eventual
isolation of the breakpoints and the genes involved in the development
of these 2 types of solid tumors. The chromosomal break in papillary
renal cell carcinoma was found to lie between PFC (300383), OATL1
(311240), TIMP (305370), SYP (313475), and TFE3, distally; and OATL2
(258870), together with a number of DNA markers (DXS226, DXS146, DXS255,
DXS14), proximally.

Shipley et al. (1995) studied 2 RCCP cell lines carrying a
t(X;1)(p11.2;q21.2) translocation; one was derived from the first female
case to be reported. By fluorescence in situ hybridization used to
position YACs along contigs in the Xp11.2 region relative to the
breakpoint and by correlation with mapping information from the region,
they concluded that the breakpoint is situated centromeric to SYP
(131475) and telomeric to DXS255 and CLCN5 (300008).

- Fusion Genes

The specific translocation reported by Meloni et al. (1993) was between
the X chromosome and chromosome 1: t(X;1)(p11;q21). Sidhar et al. (1996)
showed that in papillary renal cell carcinoma associated with the
translocation t(X;1)(p11.2;q21.2), the TFE3 gene is fused with the PRCC
gene (179755). They noted that a frequent theme for translocations in
sarcomas is the fusion of a transcription factor activation domain to a
transcription factor DNA-binding domain.

Clark et al. (1997) identified cases of papillary renal cell carcinoma
in which the splicing factor gene SFPQ (605199) was partnered with the
TFE3 gene as a result of a translocation, t(X;1)(p11.2;p34).

Cytogenetic studies identified a recurrent der(17) due to a
nonreciprocal t(X;17)(p11.2;q25) in cases of alveolar soft part sarcoma
(ASPS) (Joyama et al., 1999). By Southern blot analysis using a TFE3
probe, Ladanyi et al. (2001) identified nongermline bands in several
ASPS cases, consistent with rearrangement and possible fusion of TFE3
with a gene on 17q25. By amplification of the 5-prime portion of cDNAs
containing the 3-prime portion of TFE3 in 2 ASPS cases, they identified
a novel sequence, ASPSCR1 (606236), fused in-frame to TFE3 exon 4 or
exon 3. RT-PCR analysis detected an ASPSCR1/TFE3 fusion transcript in
all 12 ASPS cases studied. The ASPSCR1/TFE3 fusion replaces the
N-terminal portion of TFE3 by the fused ASPSCR1 sequences, while
retaining the TFE3 DNA-binding domain, implicating transcriptional
deregulation in the pathogenesis of ASPS.

Heimann et al. (2001) identified the ASPSCR1 gene, which they called
RCC17, partnered with TFE3 in two 5-year-old Belgian girls of African
origin in whom papillary renal cell carcinomas carried the translocation
t(X;17)(p11.2;q25). In both patients, the t(X;17) fused the N terminal
region of RCC17 to the C-terminal region of TFE3 including the bHLH
DNA-binding domain and the leucine zipper dimerization domain. The
reciprocal fusion transcript TFE3/RCC17 was also expressed.

Argani et al. (2003) reported a case of renal cell carcinoma in which
the 3-prime exons of the TFE3 gene were fused with the 5-prime exons of
the CLTC gene (118955) as a result of a translocation,
t(X;17)(p11.2;q23). The patient was a 14-year-old boy who presented with
gross hematuria and was found by CT to have a finely calcified left
renal mass.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Basigin is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, with a structure
related to the putative primordial form of the family. As members of the
immunoglobulin superfamily play fundamental roles in intercellular
recognition involved in various immunologic phenomena, differentiation,
and development, basigin is thought also to play a role in intercellular
recognition (Miyauchi et al., 1991; Kanekura et al., 1991).

CLONING

Basigin was cloned as a carrier of an oncodevelopmental carbohydrate
marker expressed in teratocarcinoma stem cells. It is expressed broadly
in both embryos and adults. (Miyauchi et al., 1990, 1991; Kanekura et
al., 1991).

By biochemical, immunochemical, and micropeptide sequencing analyses,
Spring et al. (1997) determined that the OK blood group antigen (see
111380) is identical to the M6 leukocyte activation antigen and BSG.
Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated ubiquitous expression in
leukocytes. Immunohistochemistry indicated that OK antigen is expressed
in a number of normal human tissues as well as in malignant cells.
Immunoblot analysis showed expression of a 34-kD protein and a 50- to
70-kD protein of similar size to that seen in erythrocyte membranes.

By PCR using primers designed from purified peptide fragments, followed
by RACE, Biswas et al. (1995) cloned EMMPRIN. The deduced 269-amino acid
protein encodes a 21-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a
185-amino acid extracellular domain, a putative transmembrane region,
and a short C-terminal domain. The extracellular domain contains 2
immunoglobulin-like subdomains, and the putative transmembrane region
has features of a leucine zipper motif. Northern blot analysis detected
a 1.7-kb EMMPRIN transcript in a human hepatic stellate cell line.

Wu et al. (2011) stated that there are 4 splice variants of BSG. RT-PCR
showed that only variant-2 was expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells. Variant-2 lacks exon 3 and encodes a protein with a deletion in
its N-terminal region compared with the full-length protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Guo et al. (1998) determined that the BSG gene contains 8 exons and
spans 10.8 kb. Exon 1 contains the 5-prime UTR and the translation start
site, which falls within a CpG island. The 5-prime flanking sequence
contains 3 consensus binding sites for SP1 (189906) and 2 sites for AP2
(107580), but no TATA or CAAT boxes.

Wu et al. (2011) reported that the BSG gene contains 10 exons. The first
4 exons, including 2 alternative first exons, are subject to alternative
splicing.

MAPPING

Kaname et al. (1993) mapped the human BSG gene to 19p13.3 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Using an interspecific backcross
panel and microsatellite polymorphisms as markers, Simon-Chazottes et
al. (1992) mapped the gene for basigin (Bsg) to mouse chromosome 10.

GENE FUNCTION

Pushkarsky et al. (2001) identified CD147 as a receptor for
extracellular cyclophilin A (CYPA; 123840). They found that CD147
enhanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection through
interaction with CYPA incorporated into virions. Virus-associated CYPA
coimmunoprecipitated with CD147 from infected cells, and antibody to
CD147 inhibited HIV-1 entry. Viruses whose replication did not require
CYPA were resistant to the inhibitory effect of anti-CD147 antibody.
Pushkarsky et al. (2001) concluded that HIV-1 entry depends on an
interaction between virus-associated CYPA and CD147 on a target cell.

Yurchenko et al. (2001) determined that CD147 also serves as a receptor
for cyclophilin B (CYPB; 123841). CYPB induced Ca(2+) flux, ERK (see
MAPK3; 601795) phosphorylation, and chemotaxis in CD147-transfected
Chinese hamster ovary cells, but not in control cells. The chemotactic
response of primary human neutrophils to CYPB was blocked by antibodies
to CD147.

Using expression cloning, Renno et al. (2002) identified CD147 as a
molecule expressed on the surface of cycling thymocytes. CD147
expression correlated with immature thymocyte cycling, and ligation of
the molecule on these cells inhibited their development into mature T
cells.

Zhou et al. (2005) identified CD147 as a subunit of native
gamma-secretase complexes (see PSEN1; 104311) purified from HeLa cell
membranes. Coimmunoprecipitation studies confirmed the presence of CD147
in HeLa cell complexes and in soluble complexes from a human neural cell
line and embryonic kidney cells. Depletion of CD147 by RNA interference
increased production of amyloid-beta (see APP; 104760) peptides without
changing the expression of other gamma-secretase components or APP
substrates. Zhou et al. (2005) concluded that the presence of CD147
within the gamma-secretase complex downmodulates production of
amyloid-beta peptides.

Schreiner et al. (2007) found that SHREW1 (AJAP1; 610972), a protein
associated with cellular invasion, interacted with CD147 in epithelial
cells. Downregulation of SHREW1 or CD147 using small interfering RNA in
HeLa cells decreased invasiveness without affecting proliferation.
Schreiner et al. (2007) concluded that SHREW1-CD147 interaction is
associated with regulation of cellular invasion.

By systematic screening of a library of erythrocyte proteins, Crosnier
et al. (2011) identified basigin as a receptor for PfRh5, a Plasmodium
falciparum ligand essential for blood stage growth of the parasite, the
causative agent of malaria (see 611162). Soluble basigin or basigin
knockdown inhibited erythrocyte invasion by all P. falciparum strains,
and complete blocking was achieved by anti-basigin antibodies. OK(a-)
red blood cells, which express the glu92-to-lys (E92K; 109480.0001)
variant of basigin, had reduced binding to PfRh5 due to slower
association and faster dissociation rates. Another basigin variant,
leu90 to pro (L90P), did not interact with PfRh5 at all. Crosnier et al.
(2011) concluded that the dependence on a single receptor-ligand pair
across many P. falciparum strains may provide novel possibilities for
therapeutic intervention.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wu et al. (2011) noted that a psoriasis susceptibility locus, PSORS6
(605364), is located on chromosome 19p13, where the BSG gene maps. They
genotyped a T-to-A SNP, dbSNP rs8259, in the 3-prime UTR of the BSG gene
in 668 psoriasis patients and 1,143 healthy controls from a central
south Chinese population. The T allele was associated with significantly
decreased susceptibility to psoriasis (odds ratio = 0.758; p = 0.002).
Wu et al. (2011) found that the T allele of dbSNP rs8259 created a
functional binding site for microRNA-492 (MIR492; 614384), leading to
reduced translation of the BSG transcript. In contrast, the A allele
abolished the MIR492-binding site and was associated with increased
expression of BSG variant-2 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

ANIMAL MODEL

Naruhashi et al. (1997) generated mice deficient in basigin by targeted
disruption. Bsg -/- mice showed worse performance than their wildtype
and heterozygous littermates in the Y-maze task, which assesses
short-term memory, and in the water-finding task, which examines latent
learning, without any motor dysfunction. Moreover, the mutant mice
showed less acclimation in the habituation task compared with the
wildtype mice. The mutant mice were also more sensitive to electric foot
shock. Naruhashi et al. (1997) found these findings consistent with the
expression profile of basigin in the central nervous system and
suggested that basigin may play an important role in learning and memory
as well as in sensory functions.

Kuno et al. (1998) demonstrated that female mice deficient in basigin
are infertile due to failure of female reproductive processes including
not only implantation but also fertilization. Bsg mRNA expression in
cumulus cells and basolateral localization of the Bsg protein in the
endometrial epithelium further support the importance of Bsg in these
processes.

In Bsg -/- mice, Philp et al. (2003) found severe reduction in
accumulation of MCT1 (600682) and MCT3 (610409) proteins in the retinal
pigment epithelium and concomitant reduction in the MCT1 and MCT4
(603877) proteins in the neural retina, supporting a role for basigin in
the targeting of these transporters to the plasma membrane. The authors
concluded that decreased expression of MCT1 and MCT4 on the surfaces of
Muller and photoreceptor cells might compromise energy metabolism in the
outer retina, leading to abnormal photoreceptor cell function and
degeneration.

In order to determine the contribution of genetic background on the
Bsg-null phenotype, Chen et al. (2004) developed 3 strains of Bsg-null
mice. In 2 strains, lack of Bsg caused a high rate of embryonic
lethality, sterility in both sexes, and blindness associated with
abnormal electroretinograms and retinal degeneration predominantly in
the photoreceptor layer. The third strain showed higher embryonic
survival, but infertility and blindness persisted.

BSG, GLU92LYS

Spring et al. (1997) determined that a G-to-A transition at nucleotide
331 of the BSG gene, leading to a glu92-to-lys substitution, resulted in
the OK(a-) phenotype (111380) in 2 Japanese sisters and an unrelated
Japanese donor. The authors noted that the OK(a-) phenotype had only
been identified in 8 families, all of which were Japanese.

609139	TITLE *609139 RECEPTOR EXPRESSION-ENHANCING PROTEIN 1; REEP1
;;CHROMOSOME 2 OPEN READING FRAME 23; C2ORF23
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transport of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the cell surface
membrane is critical for receptor-ligand recognition. However, mammalian
GPCR odorant receptors (ORs), when heterologously expressed in cells,
are poorly expressed on the cell surface. By screening for genes that
induced cell surface expression of ORs expressed in human embryonic
kidney cells, Saito et al. (2004) identified mouse and human REEP1. The
deduced mouse Reep1 protein contains 201 amino acids. Reep1 has 2
transmembrane domains, the first of which may function as a signal
peptide. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected expression of
Reep1 in olfactory and vomeronasal organs and in brain. In situ
hybridization of mouse olfactory epithelium revealed specific expression
of Reep1 in olfactory neurons. In situ hybridization of mouse brain
detected Reep1 expression in a subset of brain cells.

Beetz et al. (2012) found expression of the Reep1 gene in large motor
neurons of the ventral horn of the murine spinal cord. In HeLa cells,
wildtype human REEP1 localized to a cytoplasmic network consistent with
the tubular portion of the peripheral endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

GENE FUNCTION

Saito et al. (2004) showed that mouse Reep1 promoted functional cell
surface expression of ORs expressed in human embryonic kidney cells.
Reep1 was associated with OR proteins and enhanced the OR responses to
odorants, but its effects were much weaker than those shown by Rtp1
(609137) and Rtp2 (609138).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the REEP1
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP D2S1982).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Zuchner et al. (2006) identified mutations in the REEP1 gene causing
hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG31; 610250) in 6.5% of patients in
their sample, making REEP1 the third most common HSP gene after spastin
(SPAST; 604277) and atlastin (ATL1; 606439). Since REEP1 is widely
expressed and localized to mitochondria, the findings underscored the
importance of mitochondrial function in neurodegenerative disease.

Beetz et al. (2008) identified 16 different mutations, including 14
novel mutations, in the REEP1 gene (see, e.g., 609139.0003-609139.0004)
in 16 (3.0%) of 535 unrelated patients with familial or sporadic SPG.
Small frameshift mutations were the most common type of REEP1 mutation.
Most patients with confirmed SPG31 had a pure phenotype, although some
also reported impaired distal vibration sense, urge incontinence, or
distal amyotrophy. There was a bimodal distribution of age onset: most
(71%) patients had onset in the first or second decade, whereas the rest
had onset after age 30 years. Mutations were distributed throughout the
gene, except for exon 3, and there were no apparent genotype/phenotype
correlations. Beetz et al. (2008) postulated haploinsufficiency as the
main molecular genetic mechanism.

In affected members of an Austrian family with autosomal dominant distal
hereditary motor neuronopathy type VB (HMN5B; 614751), Beetz et al.
(2012) identified a heterozygous splice site mutation in the REEP1 gene
(609139.0006), resulting in skipping of exon 5 and a mutant protein
lacking residues 102-139. The mutation was found by linkage analysis
followed by exome sequencing. The patients had a purely lower motor
neuron phenotype, with weakness and atrophy of the intrinsic hand
muscles and milder peroneal weakness and atrophy. There were no signs of
spasticity. A mutant REEP1 protein lacking exon 5 showed some
localization similar to wildtype, but also accumulated in cytoplasmic
compact structures of varying sizes, with the largest in the perinuclear
regions. REEP1 lacking exon 5 showed colocalization with atlastin-1
(606439), including in the abnormal cytoplasmic structures. In contrast,
the A20E mutant protein (609139.0004) associated with SPG31 showed
severely altered localization to numerous punctate small structures
throughout the cytoplasm and no localization to the ER. Moreover, A20E
did not colocalize with atlastin. These findings suggested a different
pathomechanism of these 2 mutations, which may explain the different
associated phenotypes. Beetz et al. (2012) postulated that
loss-of-function REEP1 mutations (i.e., A20E) may cause upper motor
neuron disease, whereas possible gain-of-function mutations (102_139del)
may cause lower motor neuron disease. The findings expanded the
phenotypic spectrum associated with REEP1 mutations, similar to that
observed with BSCL2 (606158).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 31, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
REEP1, 1-BP DEL, 507C

In a family with hereditary spastic paraplegia showing linkage to 2p12
(SPG31; 610250), Zuchner et al. (2006) identified a single-basepair
deletion, 507delC, in the REEP1 gene.

.0002
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 31, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
REEP1, IVS3AS, A-G, -2

In a family with hereditary spastic paraplegia showing linkage to 2p12
(SPG31; 610250), Zuchner et al. (2006) identified a splice site
mutation, 182-2A-G, in the REEP1 gene.

.0003
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 31, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
REEP1, 606+43G-T, 3-PRIME UTR

In patients with SPG31 (610250), Zuchner et al. (2006) identified a
heterozygous G-to-T transversion in a highly conserved domain of the
3-prime untranslated region (606+43G-T) of the REEP1 gene. The mutation
occurred in a microRNA-binding site (MIRN140; 611894), and was predicted
to foster suppressive miRNA-mediated effects on translation, leading to
less available REEP1 protein.

Beetz et al. (2008) identified the 606+43G-T mutation in 2 unrelated
probands with SPG31.

Hewamadduma et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 606+43G-T mutation
in affected members of 2 unrelated British families with SPG31. The
proband of the first family developed unsteady gait and increased tone
and hyperreflexia in the upper and lower limbs at age 25 years. The
disease progressed, and she became wheelchair-bound. She also had mild
distal sensory loss. The proband of the second family had difficulties
in running and walking since age 9. At age 27, she had severe spastic
tetraparesis with spastic dysarthria and dysphagia, indicating bulbar
involvement. The findings indicated an expanded phenotypic spectrum
associated with REEP1 mutations.

.0004
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 31, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
REEP1, ALA20GLU

In 2 unrelated probands with SPG31 (610250), Beetz et al. (2008)
identified a heterozygous 59C-A transversion in exon 2 of the REEP1
gene, resulting in an ala20-to-glu (A20E) substitution in the first
transmembrane domain. One of the patients had a family history of the
disorder.

In HeLa cells, Beetz et al. (2012) found that the A20E mutant protein
showed severely altered localization to numerous punctate small
structures throughout the cytoplasm and no localization to the ER, as
was found with wildtype REEP1. The mutant A20E REEP1 protein showed no
interaction with atlastin-1 (606439).

.0005
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 31, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
REEP1, ARG113TER

In 3 affected members of a British family with SPG31 (610250),
Hewamadduma et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 337C-T transition in
exon 5 of the REEP1 gene, resulting in an arg113-to-ter (R113X)
substitution. The mutation was not identified in 132 British control
individuals. The age at onset ranged between 15 and 30 years. The
proband had increased tone and hyperreflexia of all 4 limbs. Both he and
his affected father also had profound lower limb wasting. All 3 had pes
cavus and severe gait disturbances, necessitating wheelchair use by the
early thirties. Neurophysiologic studies of the proband showed chronic
denervation in the peroneal and quadriceps muscles, consistent with a
motor neuropathy. The amyotrophy and neuropathy in this family were
reminiscent of distal motor neuronopathy type VB (614751) (Beetz et al.,
2012). Beetz et al. (2012) suggested that the R113X mutation may
partially escape nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and thus also have a toxic
gain-of-function effect causing lower motor neuron disease.

.0006
NEURONOPATHY, DISTAL HEREDITARY MOTOR, TYPE VB
REEP1, IVS4AS, A-G, -2

In affected members of an Austrian family with autosomal dominant distal
hereditary motor neuronopathy type VB (HMN5B; 614751), Beetz et al.
(2012) identified a heterozygous A-to-G transition in intron 4 of the
REEP1 gene (305-2A-G), resulting in the skipping of exon 5. The mutant
transcript was translated into a protein with internal deletion of a
highly conserved portion of the protein (102_139del). The variant was
not detected in over 10,000 available control chromosomes or in 88 local
control individuals. The patients had a purely lower motor neuron
phenotype, with weakness and atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles and
milder peroneal weakness and atrophy. There were no signs of spasticity.
In HeLa cells, human wildtype REEP1 localized to a cytoplasmic network
consistent with the tubular portion of the peripheral endoplasmic
reticulum. Mutant REEP1 lacking exon 5 showed some localization similar
to wildtype, but also accumulated in cytoplasmic compact structures of
varying sizes, with the largest in the perinuclear regions. REEP1
lacking exon 5 showed colocalization with atlastin-1 (606439), including
in the abnormal cytoplasmic structures. The A20E mutant protein
(609139.0004) showed severely altered localization to numerous punctate
small structures throughout the cytoplasm and no localization to the ER.
Moreover, A20E did not colocalize with atlastin. These findings
suggested a different pathomechanism of these 2 mutations, which may
explain the different associated phenotypes. Beetz et al. (2012)
postulated that loss-of-function REEP1 mutations (i.e., A20E) may cause
upper motor neuron disease, whereas possible gain-of-function mutations
(102_139del) may cause lower motor neuron disease.

606605	TITLE *606605 ATR-INTERACTING PROTEIN; ATRIP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cortez et al. (2001) searched for substrates of ATM (see 607585) and ATR
(601215) and identified a protein of 86 kD, which they called ATRIP for
'ATR-interacting protein.' The full-length cDNA encodes a deduced
791-amino acid protein with a coiled-coil domain near its N terminus.
RNA blotting indicated that ATRIP is expressed in all tissues tested.
Cortez et al. (2001) also identified an alternatively spliced exon
encoding amino acids 658 to 684 near the C-terminus. RT-PCR from 2 cell
lines indicated that both forms were expressed.

GENE FUNCTION

ATRIP is phosphorylated by ATR, regulates ATR expression, and is an
essential component of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway. Cortez et al.
(2001) demonstrated that ATR and ATRIP both localize to intranuclear
foci after DNA damage or inhibition of replication. Deletion of ATR
mediated by the Cre recombinase caused the loss of ATR and ATRIP
expression, loss of DNA damage checkpoint responses, and cell death.
Therefore, ATR is essential for the viability of human somatic cells.
Small interfering RNA directed against ATRIP caused the loss of both
ATRIP and ATR expression and the loss of checkpoint responses to DNA
damage. Cortez et al. (2001) concluded that ATRIP and ATR are mutually
dependent partners in cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathways.

The function of the ATR-ATRIP protein kinase complex is crucial for the
cellular response to replication stress and DNA damage. Zou and Elledge
(2003) demonstrated that replication protein A (RPA) complex, which
associates with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), is required for recruitment
of ATR to sites of DNA damage and for ATR-mediated CHK1 (603078)
activation in human cells. In vitro, RPA stimulates the binding of ATRIP
to single-stranded DNA. The binding of ATRIP to RPA-coated
single-stranded DNA enables the ATR-ATRIP complex to associate with DNA
and stimulates phosphorylation of the RAD17 (603139) protein that is
bound to DNA. Furthermore, Ddc2, the budding yeast homolog of ATRIP, is
specifically recruited to double-stranded DNA breaks in an RPA-dependent
manner. A checkpoint-deficient mutant of RPA, rfa1-t11, is defective for
recruiting Ddc2 to single-stranded DNA both in vivo and in vitro. Zou
and Elledge (2003) concluded that RPA-coated single-stranded DNA is the
critical structure at sites of DNA damage that recruits the ATR-ATRIP
complex and facilitates its recognition of substrates for
phosphorylation and the initiation of checkpoint signaling.

By mutation analysis, Namiki and Zou (2006) identified 2 major
RPA-ssDNA-interacting domains of ATRIP in regions flanking the conserved
coiled-coil domain. They also identified an internal region of ATRIP
that exhibited affinity to single-stranded DNA. Namiki and Zou (2006)
concluded that there are multiple interactions between ATRIP and
RPA-ssDNA and that ATRIP may interact directly with ssDNA in the
ATRIP-RPA-ssDNA complex.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATP2C1 is a Golgi-localized ATPase that mediates Golgi uptake of
cytosolic Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) and has a role in regulating Ca(2+) and
Mn(2+) cellular content (Ton et al., 2002).

CLONING

Hu et al. (2000) identified an EST corresponding to the ATP2C1 gene
within a 1.3-Mb YAC/BAC contig spanning the region of chromosome
3q21-q24 deleted in a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD; 169600).
This EST had been annotated as homologous to a yeast gene encoding a
calcium ATPase with a function predicted to be related to that of SERCA2
(ATP2A2; 108740). Hu et al. (2000) isolated the full-length cDNA
corresponding to the human EST. Similar to other Ca(2+) ATPase genes,
the ATP2C1 gene encodes 2 alternatively spliced transcripts, ATP2C1a and
ATP2C1b. These transcripts differed in their C termini (encoding amino
acids 877 to the end), but had the same expression patterns in all
tissues examined. ATP2C1a was predicted to encode 919 amino acids, and
ATP2C1b was predicted to encode 888 amino acids. The protein encoded by
ATP2C1 was highly homologous (97% identity) to rat Pmr1, which in turn
is homologous to the yeast calcium pump Pmr1, but less homologous to
other calcium pumps. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb ATP2C1
transcript in keratinocytes and in all 12 whole tissues examined.
Highest expression was in kidney and heart, and lowest expression was in
colon, thymus, and leukocytes. Patients with HHD are not known to have
extracutaneous manifestations of the disease. Hu et al. (2000) found no
differences in ATP2C1 mRNA levels between skin taken from the axilla and
skin from the buttock (sites particularly prone vs resistant to
blistering, respectively, in HHD patients) of one normal individual and
little change in ATP2C1 mRNA levels in normal human epidermal
keratinocytes cultured with glucocorticoid.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned ATP2C1 clone, which they designated
KIAA1347. The deduced 918-amino acid protein shares 97% identity with
its rat ortholog, a calcium-transporting ATPase. RT-PCR ELISA detected
variable ATP2C1 expression in all adult and fetal tissues examined, with
highest expression in ovary, followed by lung, testis, brain, liver, and
kidney. Within specific adult brain regions, highest expression was
detected in thalamus, followed by amygdala and substantia nigra.

Ton et al. (2002) showed that epitope-tagged human SPCA1 localized to
the Golgi compartment following expression in yeast and Chinese hamster
ovary cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hu et al. (2000) detected 27 exons in the ATP2C1 gene. Dobson-Stone et
al. (2002) detected 28 translated exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the ATP2C1
gene to chromosome 3. Hu et al. (2000) mapped the ATP2C1 gene to
chromosome 3q21-q24.

GENE FUNCTION

Pmr1, the yeast ortholog of SPCA1, is expressed in the Golgi compartment
and functions as a high-affinity Ca(2+)/Mn(2+) pump involved in Ca(2+)
and Mn(2+) secretion. Deletion of Pmr1 in yeast causes hypersensitivity
to Ca(2+) chelators and Mn(2+) toxicity, with defects in protein
glycosylation, processing, sorting, and endoplasmic reticulum
(ER)-related glycosylation. Ton et al. (2002) found that heterologous
expression of human SPCA1, but not SERCA-type Ca(2+)-transporting
ATPases, reduced Mn(2+) toxicity and complemented Ca(2+)-related
phenotypes in Pmr1-null yeast. Yeast Golgi vesicles expressing human
SPCA1 showed high-affinity Ca(2+) transport activity that was
inhibitable by Mn(2+), but not by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of
SERCA-type ATPases. Ton et al. (2002) proposed that SPCA1 plays a role
in maintaining Ca(2+) and Mn(2+) concentrations in Golgi and the
secretory pathway.

Using RNA interference with HeLa cells, Van Baelen et al. (2003) showed
that SPCA1 was completely responsible for thapsigargin-insensitive
Ca(2+) uptake into Golgi vesicles. Knockdown of SPCA1 did not alter
Ca(2+) handling in the ER and had only a small effect on baseline
histamine-induced Ca(2+) oscillations in whole cells.

Mukhopadhyay and Linstedt (2011) found that exposure of HeLa cells to
increased extracellular Mn(2+), but not Ca(2+), induced trafficking of
the Golgi phosphoprotein GPP130 (GOLIM4; 606805) from the Golgi to
multivesicular bodies and then to lysosomes, followed by GPP130
degradation. They showed that a gln747-to-ala (Q747A) point mutation in
SPCA1 increased Golgi uptake of cellular Mn(2+), leading to increased
GPP130 degradation and reduced Mn(2+) toxicity via secretion. In
contrast, SPCA1 containing either an asp350-to-ala (D350A) mutation,
which blocks autophosphorylation and transport of Mn(2+) and Ca(2+), or
a gly309-to-cys (G309C) mutation, which blocks transport of Mn(2+), but
not Ca(2+), reduced Golgi uptake of Mn(2+), resulting in reduced GPP130
degradation and increased Mn(2+) toxicity.

Kourtis et al. (2012) demonstrated that heat stroke triggers pervasive
necrotic cell death and neurodegeneration in C. elegans. Preconditioning
of animals at a mildly elevated temperature strongly protected from
heat-induced necrosis. The heat-shock transcription factor HSF1 (140580)
and the small heat-shock protein HSP-16.1 mediate cytoprotection by
preconditioning. HSP-16.1 localizes to the Golgi, where it functions
with the calcium- and magnesium-transporting ATPase PMR1 to maintain
calcium homeostasis under heat stroke. Preconditioning also suppresses
cell death inflicted by diverse insults, and protects mammalian neurons
from heat cytotoxicity. Kourtis et al. (2012) concluded that their
findings revealed an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that defends
against diverse necrotic stimuli. In mouse cortical neurons and striatal
cells, Kourtis et al. (2012) found that overexpression of crystallin
alpha-A (123580), which colocalizes with the Golgi marker
alpha-mannosidase-II (154582) and the PMR1 ATPase, was sufficient to
protect mammalian neurons from heat stroke-induced death, even in the
absence of preconditioning. Heat stroke caused massive necrotic death
and axonal degeneration in neurons expressing short hairpin RNAs against
Pmr1, even after preconditioning.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD; 169600) is an autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by persistent blisters and erosions of the skin. By family
linkage studies, the HHD region was localized to 3q21-q24. Study of a
family carrying a deletion helped narrow the location. To screen HHD
patients for ATP2C1 mutations, Hu et al. (2000) identified intron sites
by comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences, designed primers flanking
the 27 identified exons, and assessed PCR products from patients and
controls by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) or
conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) analyses. Among 51
unrelated kindreds of European descent and 10 of Japanese descent, they
identified 21 abnormalities (16/51 and 5/10). Of the abnormal sequences,
6 predicted single amino acid substitutions, 2 predicted aberrant
splicing, and 13 predicted prematurely truncated products through
frameshifts or single-basepair substitution. A high frequency of the
last type of mutation supported a haploinsufficiency pathogenesis
consistent with the complete deletion of the gene in 1 kindred and
further suggested that calcium pumps of the PMR1 family function as
monomers. The mechanism by which mutant ATPC1 causes acantholysis is
unknown, but it may be through abnormally elevated cytoplasmic calcium
or abnormally low Golgi Ca(2+) levels. Elevated cytoplasmic calcium
might act by altering posttranslational modification of proteins or by
inducing changes in gene expression.

Sudbrak et al. (2000) identified 13 different mutations, including
nonsense, frameshift insertion and deletions, splice-site mutations, and
nonconservative missense mutations, in ATP2C1 in patients with
Hailey-Hailey disease. The identification of ATP2A2 as the gene
defective in Darier disease (124200) provided further evidence of the
critical role of Ca(2+) signaling in maintaining epidermal integrity.

Ikeda et al. (2001) reported ATP2C1 mutations in 11 Japanese patients
with Hailey-Hailey disease. Some affected individuals had unique
clinical features (generalization of Hailey-Hailey disease and
generalized skin eruption resembling keratotic papules in Darier
disease), but other affected individuals did not, suggesting the
presence of intrafamilial phenotypic variations. These findings
reinforced the conclusion that differences in clinical phenotypes in
Hailey-Hailey disease are probably related to factors other than the
type of causative mutation.

Chao et al. (2002) identified 7 different ATP2C1 mutations, 6 of them
novel, in 7 Taiwanese kindreds with Hailey-Hailey disease. They found 3
deletion mutations, 2 nonsense mutations, 1 missense mutation, and 1
splicing mutation.

Dobson-Stone et al. (2002) screened all 28 translated exons of ATP2C1 in
24 Hailey-Hailey disease families and 3 sporadic cases and identified 22
mutations (18 novel) in 25 probands. The novel mutations comprised 3
nonsense, 6 insertion/deletion, 3 splice site, and 6 missense mutations,
and were distributed throughout the ATP2C1 gene. They noted that 6 of
the mutations were found in multiple families in their study as well as
in the studies of Sudbrak et al. (2000) and Hu et al. (2000). Haplotype
analysis revealed that 2 of these were recurrent mutations. Comparison
between genotype and phenotype in 23 families failed to yield any clear
correlation between the nature of the mutation and clinical features of
Hailey-Hailey disease. The extensive inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic
variability suggested that modifying genes and/or environmental factors
may greatly influence the clinical features of this disease.

In a patient with unilateral segmental exacerbations of Hailey-Hailey
disease, Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2004) identified heterozygosity for a
splice site mutation in exon 22 of the ATP2C1 gene (604384.0009).
Haplotype analysis of the more severely affected segmental skin regions
revealed consistent loss of the paternal wildtype allele, confirming the
authors' hypothesis that such segmental exacerbations represent a form
of mosaicism with hemizygosity for the mutation.

HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, 4-BP INS, 767CCCT

In a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al. (2000) found
a 4-bp insertion after nucleotide 767 in exon 10 of the ATP2C1 gene. The
insertion resulted in a frameshift with a premature termination codon 42
amino acids downstream of the mutation.

.0002
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, ALA304THR

In a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al. (2000)
identified a G-to-T transversion of nucleotide 910 of the ATP2C1 gene,
resulting in an ala304-to-thr amino acid substitution.

.0003
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, ARG468TER

In a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al. (2000) found
a 1402C-T transition in the ATP2C1 gene that altered codon 468 from
arginine to stop.

.0004
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, 4-BP DEL, 2374TTTG

In 2 unrelated families with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al.
(2000) found an identical 4-bp deletion of 2374delTTTG in the ATP2C1
gene. The 2 families had different alleles of the D3S1587 marker, a
locus less than 100 kb from the mutant gene, on the mutant chromosome.
This may indicate that these were independent mutations. The deletion
resulted in a premature termination codon 10 amino acids downstream of
the mutation.

.0005
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, IVS11, G-A, -1

Sudbrak et al. (2000) identified a G-to-A transition at the 3-prime end
of intron 11 (nucleotide position 852) of the ATP2C1 gene in a family
with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600). The effect on the cDNA was not
determined.

In a Japanese patient who represented a sporadic occurrence of
Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Yokota et al. (2002) reported a
cys490-to-phe (C490F) amino acid substitution that arose from a 1469G-T
transversion in exon 17 of the ATP2C1 gene.

In a Japanese patient who represented a sporadic occurrence of
Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Yokota et al. (2002) reported a T-to-C
transition at nucleotide 1751 in exon 19 of the ATP2C1 gene, resulting
in a leu584-to-pro (L584P) amino acid substitution.

.0009
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, IVS22, G-A, +1

In a patient with unilateral segmental exacerbations of Hailey-Hailey
disease (169600), originally reported by Vakilzadeh and Kolde (1985),
Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2004) identified heterozygosity for a G-to-A
transition at the first base of the consensus splice donor site of exon
22 of the ATP2C1 gene. The mutation, which they designated 2146+1G-A,
resulted in the skipping of the 69-bp exon 22. Haplotype analysis of the
more severely affected segmental skin regions revealed consistent loss
of the paternal wildtype allele, confirming the authors' hypothesis that
such segmental exacerbations represent a form of mosaicism with
hemizygosity for the mutation.

601506	TITLE *601506 SEPTIN 2; SEPT2
;;NEURAL PRECURSOR CELL EXPRESSED, DEVELOPMENTALLY DOWNREGULATED 5;
NEDD5;;
DIFF6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mori et al. (1996) isolated a human cDNA that encodes a protein
homologous to murine H5 and Diff6 and to yeast CDC10 (603151). The NEDD5
cDNA encodes a predicted protein of 406 amino acids. The deduced peptide
sequence contains conserved domains rich in basic residues, a motif of
the GTPase superfamily. Different poly(A) sites account for generation
of 2 transcripts. The major 3.5-kb transcript was expressed ubiquitously
in all human tissues examined, and a 2.0-kb alternative transcript
lacking any long AU-rich element in the 3-prime noncoding region was
expressed abundantly only in testis, heart, and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Low and Macara (2006) noted that specific combinations of septins can
hetero-oligomerize and form filaments in vitro and in vivo. Using
fluorescence resonance energy transfer, size exclusion chromatography,
and multi-angle light scattering analyses, they characterized the
complex formed by SEPT2, SEPT6 (300683), and SEPT7 (603151). SEPT6 and
SEPT7 interacted through a parallel coiled-coil domain, and SEPT2
interacted with SEPT6 through its C-terminal coiled-coil domain.

Kremer et al. (2007) showed that knockdown of SEPT2, SEPT6, and SEPT7 in
HeLa cells caused actin stress fibers to disintegrate and cells to lose
polarity. They found that these septins acted through SOCS7 (608788) to
restrict nuclear accumulation of NCK (NCK1; 600508). In the absence of
septin filaments, SOCS7 recruited NCK into the nucleus. Moreover,
depletion of NCK from the cytoplasm triggered dissolution of actin
stress fibers and loss of cell polarity. Kremer et al. (2007) also
showed that the association between septins, SOCS7, and NCK played a
role in the DNA damage checkpoint response. NCK entered the nucleus
following DNA damage and was required for ultraviolet (UV)-induced cell
cycle arrest. Furthermore, nuclear NCK was essential for activation of
p53 (TP53; 191170) in response to UV-induced DNA damage. Kremer et al.
(2007) concluded that septins, SOCS7, and NCK are part of a signaling
pathway that couples regulation of the DNA damage response to the
cytoskeleton.

Hu et al. (2010) demonstrated that ciliary membrane proteins are highly
mobile, but their diffusion is impeded at the base of the cilium by a
diffusion barrier. Sept2, a member of the septin family of guanosine
triphosphatases that form a diffusion barrier in budding yeast,
localized at the base of the ciliary membrane. Sept2 depletion resulted
in loss of ciliary membrane protein localization and Sonic hedgehog
(SHH; 600725) signal transduction, and inhibited ciliogenesis. Thus, Hu
et al. (2010) concluded that SEPT2 is a part of a diffusion barrier at
the base of the ciliary membrane and is essential for retaining
receptor-signaling pathways in the primary cilium. These experiments
used IMCD3 (mouse kidney inner medullary collecting duct) cells and
murine embryonic fibroblasts.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Sirajuddin et al. (2007) presented the crystal structures of the human
SEPT2 G domain and the heterotrimeric human SEPT2-SEPT6-SEPT7 complex.
This structure revealed a universal bipolar polymer building block,
composed of an extended G domain, which forms oligomers and filaments by
conserved interactions between adjacent nucleotide-binding sites and/or
the amino- and carboxy-terminal extensions. Unexpectedly, x-ray
crystallography and electron microscopy showed that the predicted coiled
coils are not involved in or required for complex and/or filament
formation. The asymmetrical heterotrimers associate head-to-head to form
a hexameric unit that is nonpolarized along the filament axis but is
rotationally asymmetrical. Sirajuddin et al. (2007) concluded that the
architecture of septin filaments differs fundamentally from that of
other cytoskeletal structures.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Mori et al. (1996) mapped the
NEDD5 gene to 2q37.

606374	TITLE *606374 BETA-1,3-GLUCURONYLTRANSFERASE 3; B3GAT3
;;GLUCURONOSYLTRANSFERASE I; GLCATI
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using PCR with degenerate primers based on the sequence of rat Glcatp
(B3GAT1; 151290) to screen a placenta cDNA library, Kitagawa et al.
(1998) obtained a cDNA encoding B3GAT3, which they termed GLCATI. The
deduced 335-amino acid type II transmembrane protein, which is 43%
identical to rat Glcatp, has a potential N-glycosylation site and a
proline-rich domain, which is adjacent to its transmembrane region.
Functional analysis of soluble B3GAT3 showed that it is a
glycoserine-specific glucuronyltransferase.

By Northern blot analysis, Kitagawa et al. (2001) found ubiquitous
expression of a 1.5-kb B3GAT3 transcript, with highest levels in brain,
placenta, and liver, and lower levels in heart, lung, skeletal muscle,
kidney, and pancreas.

Using reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR on corresponding mouse
tissues, Baasanjav et al. (2011) demonstrated expression of B3GAT3 in
heart, aorta, bone, and osteoblasts. In addition, B3GAT3 protein was
present in human aorta.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kitagawa et al. (2001) determined that the B3GAT3 gene spans 7 kb and
contains 5 exons. Sequence analysis of the promoter region revealed 2
putative start sites and consensus binding sites for several
transcription factors.

MAPPING

Kitagawa et al. (2001) mapped the B3GAT3 gene to chromosome 11q12-q13 by
in situ hybridization. They mapped a B3GAT3 pseudogene to chromosome 3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a consanguineous family in the United Arab Emirates in which 5 of 7
sibs had multiple joint dislocations, short stature, craniofacial
dysmorphism, and congenital heart defects mapping to chromosome 11q12
(245600), Baasanjav et al. (2011) sequenced 30 functional candidate
genes and identified homozygosity for a missense mutation at a highly
conserved residue in the B3GAT3 gene (R277Q; 606374.0001) that
segregated with disease in the family. Functional studies revealed a
significant reduction of glucuronyltansferase activity in mutant
fibroblasts compared to controls, and patient fibroblasts showed
decreased levels of all 3 lines of O-glycanated proteoglycans.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MULTIPLE JOINT DISLOCATIONS, SHORT STATURE, CRANIOFACIAL DYSMORPHISM,
AND CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS
B3GAT3, ARG277GLN

In 5 sibs from a consanguineous family with multiple joint dislocations,
short stature, craniofacial dysmorphism, and congenital heart defects
(245600), Baasanjav et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for an 830G-A
transition in exon 4 of the B3GAT3 gene, resulting in an arg277-to-gln
(R277Q) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the GlcA-binding
domain. The mutation segregated with disease in the family and was not
found in 294 population-matched chromosomes or in 850 chromosomes from
Berlin blood donors. Patient fibroblasts showed a significant reduction
of glucuronyltransferase activity, to levels that were only 3 to 5% of
age-matched control levels. In addition, patient fibroblasts
demonstrated decreased levels of dermatan sulfate (see 125255),
chondroitin sulfate (see 155760), and heparan sulfate (see 142460)
proteoglycans, indicating that the defect in linker synthesis affected
all 3 lines of O-glycanated proteoglycans.

607003	TITLE *607003 THYMIC STROMAL LYMPHOPOIETIN; TSLP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Several cytokines, including interleukin-7 (IL7; 146660), play a key
role in the development of B lymphocytes. TSLP is a member of this
family of B cell-stimulating factors.

CLONING

By EST and genomic database screening for sequences similar to IL7,
followed by screening a lung fibroblast sarcoma cDNA library, Reche et
al. (2001) obtained a cDNA encoding TSLP. The deduced 159-amino acid
protein, which is only 43% identical to mouse Tslp, contains a
28-residue signal sequence, 6 cysteines, and 2 N-glycosylation sites.
SDS-PAGE analysis showed expression of a 23-kD protein, larger than the
predicted 15 kD, suggesting that TSLP is glycosylated. PCR analysis of a
panel of cDNA libraries and cultured cell lines indicated that
expression of a 1.3-kb TSLP transcript may be restricted to a few lung
libraries. Reche et al. (2001) also identified TSLP receptor, which is
composed of TSLPR (CRLF2; 300357) and IL7R (146661) subunits. Dendritic
cells (DCs) and monocytes coexpress IL7R and TSLPR.

Quentmeier et al. (2001) also cloned and characterized TSLP. They noted
the presence of 7 basic C-terminal amino acids (KKRRKRK) in the protein
and that 6 of the 7 cysteines in the mouse protein (those involved in
disulfide bond formation) are conserved in human, whereas the sites for
N-glycosylation are distinct. Northern blot analysis revealed wide
expression of an approximately 1.1-kb transcript, with highest levels in
heart, liver, testis, and prostate.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Quentmeier et al. (2001) mapped the
TSLP gene to chromosome 5 in a region showing homology of synteny to
mouse chromosome 18, where the mouse Tslp gene is localized.

GENE FUNCTION

Reche et al. (2001) showed that incubation of DCs or monocytes with TSLP
enhanced the expression of CCL17 (601520), CCL18 (603757), CCL22
(602957), and CCL19 (602227). IL7, on the other hand, induced expression
of CCL17, CCL22, and CCL19, but also CXCL8 (146930), CXCL7 (121010),
CXCL5 (600324), CXCL1 (155730), CXCL2 (139110), and CXCL3 (139111).
Functional analysis indicated that TSLP enhances the DC maturation
process, as evidenced by upregulation of DC markers and costimulatory
molecules and stronger T-cell proliferation.

By screening myeloid cell lines, Quentmeier et al. (2001) established
that an acute myeloid leukemia line, MUTZ-3, responds by proliferating
in response to TSLP. TSLP also inhibited apoptosis in these cells.
Proliferation in response to TSLP could not be attributed to the
production of other growth factors tested and could be inhibited by
relatively high concentrations of anti-IL7R. TSLP, like IL7, stimulated
phosphorylation of STAT5 (601511), but unlike IL7, it did not activate
JAK3 (600173). TSLP did not phosphorylate mitogen-activated protein
kinases (e.g., ERK1; 601795).

By flow cytometric analysis, Soumelis et al. (2002) showed that
TSLP-activated DCs (TSLP-DCs) express higher levels of HLA-DR and DCLAMP
(605883) than do nonactivated or IL7-activated DCs, and that TSLP-DCs
induce marked proliferation and expansion of allogeneic naive CD4
(186940)-positive T cells. Quantitative mRNA screening and ELISA
analysis showed that TSLP-DCs do not produce detectable proinflammatory
cytokines, but do produce high levels of TARC (CCL17) and MDC (CCL22)
chemokines, which preferentially attract CCR4 (604836)-expressing Th2
lymphocytes. TSLP-DCs induced CD4 cells to produce high amounts of IL13
(147683), IL5 (147850), and the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis
factor (TNF; 191160), but only low amounts of IL10 (124092) and
gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570). RT-PCR analysis did not detect TSLP in
most hemopoietic cells, the exception being mast cells. Keratinocytes,
epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and lung fibroblasts also
expressed high levels of TSLP. Within tonsils, highest levels were in
crypt epithelial cells. Soumelis et al. (2002) suggested that TSLP may
contribute to constitutive inflammation in this tissue and sporadic
inflammation in squamous epithelium. Immunohistochemical analysis of
allergic inflammatory tissue showed high expression of TSLP in
keratinocytes of acute and chronic atopic dermatitis lesions, but no
expression in normal skin. Strong TSLP expression in atopic dermatitis
was associated with the disappearance of langerin (604862)-positive
Langerhans cells within the epidermis and the concurrent appearance of
many DCLAMP-activated DCs within the dermis, many of which expressed
langerin. Soumelis et al. (2002) proposed that TSLP expression by
keratinocytes in atopic dermatitis lesions may contribute directly to
the activation of Langerhans cells, which may migrate into the dermis
and then the draining lymph nodes where they can prime allergen-specific
Th2 responses.

Watanabe et al. (2005) reported that human Hassall corpuscles express
TSLP. Human TSLP activates thymic CD11c+ (151510) dendritic cells to
express high levels of CD80 (112203) and CD86 (601020). These
TSLP-conditioned cells are then able to induce the proliferation and
differentiation of CD4+/CD8-(186910)/CD25-(147730) thymic T cells into
CD4+/CD25+/FOXP3+ (300292) regulatory T cells. This induction depends on
peptide-MHC class II interactions and the presence of CD80 and CD86 as
well as IL2 (147680). Immunohistochemistry studies revealed that
CD25+/CTLA4+(123890) regulatory T cells associate in the thymic medulla
with activated or mature dendritic cells and TSLP-expressing Hassall
corpuscles. Watanabe et al. (2005) concluded that Hassall corpuscles
have a critical role in dendritic cell-mediated secondary positive
selection of medium to high affinity self-reactive T cells, leading to
the generation of CD4+/CD25+ regulatory T cells within the thymus.

Siracusa et al. (2011) demonstrated that TSLP promotes systemic
basophilia, that disruption of TSLP-TSLPR interactions results in
defective basophil responses, and that TSLPR-sufficient basophils can
restore TH2-cell-dependent immunity in vivo. TSLP acted directly on bone
marrow-resident progenitors to promote basophil responses selectively.
Critically, TSLP could elicit basophil responses in both IL3
(147740)-IL3R (see 308385)-sufficient and -deficient environments, and
genomewide transcriptional profiling and functional analyses identified
heterogeneity between TSLP-elicited versus IL3-elicited basophils.
Furthermore, activated human basophils expressed TSLPR, and basophils
isolated from eosinophilic esophagitis (see 610247) patients were
distinct from classical basophils. Siracusa et al. (2011) concluded that
collectively, their studies identified previously unrecognized
heterogeneity within the basophil cell lineage and indicated that
expression of TSLP may influence susceptibility to multiple allergic
diseases by regulating basophil hematopoiesis and eliciting a population
of functionally distinct basophils that promote TH2 cytokine-mediated
inflammation.

gene and eosinophilic esophagitis, see EOE2 (613412).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using mice deficient in Il7r and/or the common cytokine receptor gamma
chain, Il2rg (308380), Vobhenrich et al. (2003) determined the cytokines
responsible for fetal and perinatal lymphopoiesis in the absence of Il7.
Fetal and perinatal B-cell lymphopoiesis occurred in the bone marrow of
Il2rg -/- mice until 12 weeks of age, but it was absent in Il7r -/- mice
by 4 weeks of age. Lymphopoiesis in Il7r -/- mice was restricted to
fetal liver and was dependent on the presence of Tslp. The residual
lymphopoiesis that occurred in Il7r -/- mice was dependent on Flk2
(136351). Vobhenrich et al. (2003) concluded that TSLP is the main
factor driving IL7-independent fetal and perinatal lymphopoiesis,
although FLK2 is involved.

Using a mouse model of allergic skin inflammation elicited by repeated
epicutaneous (EC) sensitization with ovalbumin (OVA) to tape-stripped
skin, which mimics the scratching-inflicted injury associated with
atopic dermatitis (see 603165), He et al. (2008) found that Tslpr -/-
mice had reduced inflammation, with fewer eosinophils and local Th2
cytokine expression, but unchanged splenocyte secretion of these
cytokines. Addition of Tslp significantly enhanced Th2 cytokine
secretion in vitro by targeting Tlspr on antigen-specific T cells.
Intradermal injection of anti-Tlsp blocked the development of allergic
skin inflammation after EC antigen challenge of OVA-immunized wildtype
mice. He et al. (2008) proposed that TLSP is essential for
antigen-driven Th2 cytokine secretion by skin-infiltrating effector T
cells.

614758	TITLE *614758 DYNACTIN 4; DCTN4
;;DYN4;;
DYNACTIN, 62-KD SUBUNIT;;
p62
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DCTN4 is a subunit of the 20S dynactin complex. The dynactin complex is
involved in microtubule-dependent vesicular transport, spindle assembly,
and cell division (summary by Karki et al., 2000).

CLONING

By gene dosage analysis and sequencing candidate genes in a YAC contig
covering the critical region of the 5q deletion syndrome (153550),
followed by database analysis, Boultwood et al. (2000) identified a
DCTN4 clone designated 605d01. Northern blot analysis detected a 7.5-kb
DCTN4 transcript in all 15 human tissues examined.

By mass spectrometric analysis of the 62-kD protein that affinity
purified with human dynactin, followed by EST database analysis and PCR
of an NT2 human teratocarcinoma cDNA library, Karki et al. (2000) cloned
DCTN4, which they called p62. The deduced 460-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 52.3 kD. It has an N-terminal domain with
11 cysteines, the last 8 of which fit the consensus sequence for a RING
domain predicted to bind 2 Zn(2+) atoms. Northern blot analysis detected
variable expression of an approximately 4.2-kb transcript in all tissues
examined, with highest expression in heart and skeletal muscle.
Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that p62 had a punctate cytoplasmic
distribution as well as a centrosomal distribution typical of dynactin.

By immunohistochemical analysis, Ayalon et al. (2008) showed that Dyn4
colocalized with other dynactin subunits in adult mouse muscle fibers.
Dyn4 localized in a punctate distribution along costamere lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Karki et al. (2000) stated that p62 is present in the dynactin complex
at a stoichiometry of 1 copy per complex and that it localizes at 1 end
of the central ARP1 (ACTR1A; 605143) polymeric filament. Using
biochemical and immunoprecipitation analyses, they showed that p62
associated with the rat 20S dynactin complex. Recombinant human p62
bound immobilized in vitro-translated human ARP1. Overexpression of p62
in PtK2 porcine kidney cells did not disrupt microtubule organization or
the integrity of the Golgi, but it resulted in some p62 nuclear
localization.

ATP7B (606882) localizes to the trans-Golgi network, where it transports
copper to apoceruloplasmin (CP; 117700). When copper levels are in
excess, ATP7B redistributes to a vesicular compartment near the biliary
canalicular membranes, where excess copper is eliminated into bile.
Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human liver cDNA library, Lim et al.
(2006) found that the N-terminal domain of ATP7B, which contains 6
N-terminal metal-binding sites, interacted with the C-terminal domain of
p62. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that ATP7B, but not ATP7A
(300011), interacted with endogenous p62 in a human fibroblast line.
Depletion of copper reduced interaction of ATP7B with p62. Mutation
analysis revealed that the metal-binding CxxC motifs of ATP7B were
required for its interaction with p62, predominantly CxxC motifs 4
through 6. Lim et al. (2006) concluded that ATP7B is transported along
liver cell microtubules in a copper-dependent manner via interaction
with p62.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse heart cDNA library, Ayalon et al.
(2008) found that Ankb (ANK2; 106410) interacted with Dyn4. Protein
pull-down assays confirmed the interaction. Depletion of Ankb in adult
mouse skeletal muscle fibers disrupted costamere-associated
microtubules, concomitant with loss of costamere-associated Dyn4
expression.

MAPPING

By database and YAC contig analyses, Boultwood et al. (2000) mapped the
DCTN4 gene to chromosome 5q31-q32.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Emond et al. (2012) used exome sequencing and an extreme phenotype study
design to discover genetic variants influencing Pseudomonas aeruginosa
infection in cystic fibrosis. Forty-three individuals with early age of
onset of chronic P. aeruginosa infection (all below the tenth percentile
of age at onset), and the 48 oldest individuals who had not reached
chronic P. aeruginosa infection (all past the mean age of onset) were
sequenced. After Bonferroni adjustment, a single gene, DCTN4, was
significantly associated with time to chronic P. aeruginosa infection
(naive P = 2.2 x 10(-6); adjusted P = 0.025). Twelve of the 43
individuals in the early extreme sample carried a missense variant in
DCTN4, 9 a phe349-to-leu substitution (F349L; dbSNP rs11954652) and 3 a
tyr270-to-cys substitution (Y270C; dbSNP rs35772018). None of the 48
individuals in the late P. aeruginosa extreme sample had either missense
variant. Subsequently, 696 individuals with varied CFTR genotypes were
studied. Seventy-eight participants were heterozygous and 9 were
homozygous for the F349L (614758.0001) mutation; 15 were heterozygous
for the Y270C (614758.0002) mutation; 1 individual was heterozygous for
both mutations. The presence of at least 1 DCTN4 missense variant was
significantly associated with both early age of first P.
aeruginosa-positive culture (p = 0.01, hazard ratio = 1.4) and with
early age of onset of chronic P. aeruginosa infection (p = 0.004, hazard
ratio = 1.9). The risk was highest in individuals with less selective
bias toward a P. aeruginosa-negative history, i.e., children enrolled
before 1.5 years of age and 103 enrollees who participated in the study
despite a history of P. aeruginosa-positive cultures. No significant
interaction was found between CFTR genotypes and DCTN4 mutations,
although power to detect such an interaction was low.

610630	TITLE *610630 PROTEIN TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, NONRECEPTOR-TYPE, 20A; PTPN20A
;;PTPN20, CENTROMERIC COPY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Protein tyrosine phosphorylation plays an integral role in cellular
signaling and controls diverse cellular responses. Tyrosine
phosphorylation is a reversible and dynamic process controlled by the
activities of protein tyrosine kinases, which mediate the
phosphorylation reaction, and protein tyrosine phosphatases, such as
PTPN20A, which catalyze tyrosine dephosphorylation (Fodero-Tavoletti et
al., 2005).

CLONING

Using differential display to identify genes upregulated during
differentiation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, followed by
5-prime RACE of human testis and umbilical vein endothelial cell mRNA,
Fodero Tavoletti et al. (2005) cloned multiple PTPN20A splice variants.
The most widely expressed variant encodes a deduced 411-amino acid
protein with a 280-amino acid PTP catalytic domain containing 10
conserved catalytic motifs. Northern blot analysis detected high
expression of a 3.0-kb PTPN20A transcript in testis. RT-PCR detected the
primary PTPN20A transcript in all human cell lines examined, whereas the
other variants showed more restricted and variable expression. Western
blot analysis detected PTPN20A at an apparent molecular mass of 47.4 kD.
In nonsynchronized transfected COS-1 cells, epitope-tagged PTPN20A
showed an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi localization in some
cells, and diffuse cytoplasmic and cell peripheral staining in others.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro analysis, Fodero-Tavoletti et al. (2005) found that
recombinant PTPN20A exhibited catalytic activity toward
tyrosyl-phosphorylated substrates. In serum-starved COS-1 cells, PTPN20A
was targeted to the nucleus and the microtubule network, colocalizing
with the microtubule-organizing center and intracellular membrane
compartments, including the ER and Golgi apparatus. Stimulation of cells
with EGF (131530), osmotic shock, a PTP inhibitor, or integrin ligation
targeted PTPN20A to actin-rich structures that included membrane
ruffles.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fodero-Tavoletti et al. (2005) determined that the PTPN20A gene contains
12 exons and spans 92 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and FISH, Fodero-Tavoletti et al. (2005)
mapped the PTPN20A gene to chromosome 10q11.2. A nearly identical copy
of PTPN20A, PTPN20B (610631), is located telomeric to PTPN20A (Hartz,
2006).

602874	TITLE *602874 UDP-GLUCOSE CERAMIDE GLUCOSYLTRANSFERASE; UGCG
;;GLUCOSYLCERAMIDE SYNTHASE; GCS;;
CERAMIDE GLUCOSYLTRANSFERASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG; EC 2.4.1.80) catalyzes
the first glycosylation step in glycosphingolipid (GSL) biosynthesis.
The product, glucosylceramide, is the core structure of more than 300
GSLs. GSLs are a group of membrane components that contain lipid and
sugar moieties. They are present in essentially all animal cells and are
believed to have important roles in various cellular processes (summary
by Ichikawa et al., 1996).

CLONING

Ichikawa et al. (1996) cloned a UGCG cDNA by expressing a human melanoma
cell cDNA library in a UGCG-deficient cell line and screening for UGCG
complementation. The predicted 394-amino acid UGCG protein has a
potential signal-anchor sequence and a single transmembrane domain near
the N terminus, and very hydrophobic regions close to the C terminus,
which may interact with the membrane. Northern blot analysis detected a
3.5-kb UGCG transcript in all human tissues examined.

By Western blot analysis using antibodies against GCS, or UGCG, Watanabe
et al. (1998) detected an approximately 38-kD protein in human
keratinocytes. They showed that GCS transcription is upregulated during
keratinocyte differentiation.

MAPPING

Ichikawa et al. (1997) mapped the UGCG gene to 9q31 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization. Ichikawa et al. (1998) mapped the mouse Ugcg gene to
chromosome 4B3.

138130	TITLE *138130 GLUTAMATE DEHYDROGENASE 1; GLUD1
;;GLUD;;
GDH
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

L-glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.3) has a central role in nitrogen
metabolism in plants and animals. Glutamate dehydrogenase is found in
all organisms and catalyzes the oxidative deamination of 1-glutamate to
2-oxoglutarate (Smith et al., 2001). Glutamate, the main substrate of
GLUD, is present in brain in concentrations higher than in other organs.
In nervous tissue, GLUD appears to function in both the synthesis and
the catabolism of glutamate and perhaps in ammonia detoxification
(Mavrothalassitis et al., 1988).

CLONING

Hanauer et al. (1985) detected a cDNA clone expressed in skeletal muscle
that they concluded is homologous with GLUD because of close
similarities of its deduced amino acid sequence to that of the bovine
protein. Mavrothalassitis et al. (1988) reported the characterization of
4 human liver cDNA clones encoding the entire sequence of GLUD.
Blot-hybridization analysis of genomic DNA suggested that the human
enzyme is encoded by a small multigene family. Multiple GLUD-related
transcripts were identified in human, monkey, and rabbit tissues.
Nakatani et al. (1988) reported the complete sequence of GLUD cDNA.

Son et al. (2013) reported that whereas most cells use GLUD1 to convert
glutamine-derived glutamate into alpha-ketoglutarate in the mitochondria
to fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(see 260350) cells rely on a distinct pathway in which glutamine-derived
aspartate is transported into the cytoplasm, where it can be converted
into oxaloacetate by aspartate transaminase (GOT1; 138180). Son et al.
(2013) found that knockdown of KRAS (190070) in PDAC cells resulted in a
marked increase in GLUD1 and a decrease in GOT1 expression at both the
transcriptional and the protein levels. Additionally, they showed that
expression on GOT1 increased and GLUD1 decreased in an oncogenic
KRAS-dependent manner in vivo. Son et al. (2013) concluded that their
findings demonstrated that the reprogramming of glutamine metabolism is
mediated by oncogenic KRAS, the signature genetic alteration in PDAC,
through the transcriptional upregulation and repression of key metabolic
enzymes in this pathway.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Hanauer et al. (1985) mapped the GLUD1 gene to
10q23-q24.

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization,
Anagnou et al. (1989) confirmed the assignment of GLUD1 to chromosome
10, but concluded that the precise localization is 10q21.1-q21.2. By in
situ hybridization, Jung et al. (1989) mapped the gene to 10q23, and
Deloukas et al. (1993) refined the localization to 10q23.3.

Using a RFLP in the study of recombinant inbred strains, Shaughnessy et
al. (1989) found that the murine Glud locus cosegregates with Rib1
(180440) and Tcra (see 186880), which are known to be on mouse
chromosome 14. By genomic Southern analysis of a panel of Chinese
hamster/mouse somatic cell hybrids, Tzimagiorgis et al. (1991) concluded
that there are 2 independent mouse GLUD loci, termed Glud and Glud2,
which map to chromosome 14 and 7, respectively. By homology, the Glud
locus on chromosome 14 is likely to be the functional one. On the other
hand, their evidence appeared to indicate that the Glud2 gene on mouse
chromosome 7 is not a processed pseudogene. Both chromosome 7 and 14 of
the mouse have regions of linkage homology to human 10q.

- Pseudogenes

Several GLUD pseudogenes have been identified. Hanauer et al. (1985) and
Anagnou et al. (1989) confirmed the presence of a pseudogene, GLUDP1, on
Xq26-28. Jung et al. (1989) mapped the GLUDP1 pseudogene to Xq24.
Michaelidis et al. (1993) identified 4 presumed truncated pseudogenes,
at least 2 of which may have been generated by retrotransposition.
Deloukas et al. (1993) concluded that there are 2 GLUD pseudogenes on
10q which are not linked to the functional gene: GLUDP2 at 10q11.2 and
GLUDP3 at 10q22.1. Tzimagiorgis et al. (1993) mapped another locus,
termed GLUDP5, to 10p11.2. They pointed out that the work of their group
(Michaelidis et al., 1993) raised the number of human GLUD loci to 6.

GENE STRUCTURE

Michaelidis et al. (1993) determined that the GLUD1 gene is about 45 kb
long and contains 13 exons.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Hanauer et al. (1985) suggested that the GLUD clones they detected may
be useful in study of the postulated relationship of partial glutamate
dehydrogenase deficiency and a form of olivopontocerebellar atrophy
(OPCA). Plaitakis et al. (1980, 1982, 1984) and Duvoisin et al. (1983)
found partial deficiency of GLUD in fibroblasts and leukocytes of some
patients with OPCA. Yamaguchi et al. (1982) and Sorbi et al. (1986)
found a similar deficiency in platelets of OPCA patients. Barbeau et al.
(1980) could find no abnormality of GLUD in 8 patients with a dominant
form of OPCA.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 infants with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia
(606762), Stanley et al. (1997) identified heterozygosity for activating
mutations in the GLUD1 gene (138130.0001 and 138130.0002).

In a study of 4 sporadic and 2 familial cases, Stanley et al. (1998)
identified 5 missense mutations that alter 1 of 4 amino acids between
residues 446 and 454 in exons 11 and 12 of the GLUD1 gene (see, e.g.,
138130.0003-138130.0005), a region that encodes the allosteric domain.
All of these mutations were associated with a diminished inhibitory
effect of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) on glutamate dehydrogenase
activity.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 6
GLUD1, HIS454TYR

In an infant with the syndrome of hypoglycemia due to congenital
hyperinsulinism combined with persistent unexplained hyperammonemia
(606762), Stanley et al. (1997) identified heterozygosity for a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 1519 in the GLUD1 gene, predicted to cause a
his454-to-tyr (H454Y) substitution in the mature protein. The patient
was a sporadic case. Also see 138130.0002.

.0002
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 6
GLUD1, SER445LEU

In an infant with the syndrome of hypoglycemia due to congenital
hyperinsulinism combined with persistent unexplained hyperammonemia
(606762), Stanley et al. (1997) identified heterozygosity for a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 1493 in the GLUD1 gene, predicted to cause a
ser445-to-leu (S448L) substitution in the mature GDH peptide. Both of
the mutations reported by Stanley et al. (1997) (see 138130.0001)
affected only 1 of the 2 GDH alleles and were not present in the
parents, indicating that the disorder is autosomal dominant.

In 3 unrelated Japanese infants with congenital
hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia, Miki et al. (2000) identified
heterozygosity for the S445L mutation in the allosteric domain of the
GLUD1 gene.

.0003
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 6
GLUD1, SER448PRO

In affected members of 2 separate families with hyperinsulinemic
hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia (606762), one from Canada and the other
from Italy, Stanley et al. (1998) identified heterozygosity for a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 1514, resulting in a ser448-to-pro (S448P)
substitution. In each family, a mother and child were affected. This
mutation results in less severe hypoglycemia than that seen in patients
with a sporadic mutation. Basal enzyme activity was 38% of normal.

In family 2 studied by Thornton et al. (1998), Glaser et al. (1998)
identified the S448P mutation in the GLUD1 gene.

.0004
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 6
GLUD1, GLY446SER

In 2 unrelated individuals with hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome
(606762), Stanley et al. (1998) identified heterozygosity for a G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 1508 of the GLUD1 gene, resulting in a
gly446-to-ser (G446S) substitution at codon 446. This dominant mutation
causes severe hypoglycemia and a 2- to 5-fold increase in plasma
ammonium concentration due to decreased sensitivity to GTP-induced
inhibition, which was demonstrated in the patients' lymphoblasts.

.0005
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 6
GLUD1, GLY446ASP

In 2 unrelated individuals with the hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia
syndrome (606762), Stanley et al. (1998) identified heterozygosity for a
G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1509 of the GLUD1 gene, resulting in a
gly446-to-asp (G446D) substitution. This dominant mutation results in
severe hypoglycemia and a 2- to 5-fold increase in plasma ammonium
concentration due to decreased sensitivity to GTP-induced inhibition,
which was demonstrated in the patients' lymphoblasts.

.0006
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 6
GLUD1, GLU296ALA

In a 6-month-old Japanese girl with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and
hyperammonemia (606762), Miki et al. (2000) identified heterozygosity
for a 1059A-C transversion in exon 7 of the GLUD1 gene, resulting in a
glu296-to-ala (E296A) substitution within the catalytic domain.

.0007
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 6
GLUD1, ARG265LYS

In a 6-day-old Japanese boy with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and
hyperammonemia (606762), Miki et al. (2000) identified heterozygosity
for a 966G-A transition in exon 7 of the GLUD1 gene, resulting in an
arg265-to-lys (R265K) substitution within the catalytic domain.

.0008
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 6
GLUD1, ARG221CYS

In 5 affected members of a 3-generation family with hyperinsulinemic
hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia (606762), Santer et al. (2001)
identified heterozygosity for an 833C-T transition in exon 6 of the
GLUD1 gene, resulting in an arg221-to-cys (R221C) substitution within
the catalytic domain.

.0009
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 6
GLUD1, ARG269HIS

In 9 affected members of 6 unrelated families with hyperinsulinemic
hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia (606762), Santer et al. (2001)
identified heterozygosity for a 978G-A transition in exon 7 of the GLUD1
gene, resulting in an arg269-to-his (R269H) substitution within the
catalytic domain.

606154	TITLE *606154 MUCIN 16; MUC16
;;OVARIAN CARCINOMA ANTIGEN CA125
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

CA125 is a tumor antigen widely used in monitoring ovarian cancer. Using
a rabbit polyclonal antibody produced to purified CA125 antigen to
screen cells from an ovarian cancer cell (OVCAR-3) cDNA library in E.
coli, Yin and Lloyd (2001) cloned a long partial cDNA, which they
designated MUC16, corresponding to the CA125 antigen. The deduced
1,890-amino acid protein contains characteristic features of a
mucin-type molecule, including a high serine, threonine, and proline
content in an N-terminal region of 9 partially conserved tandem repeats
and a C-terminal region nontandem repeat sequence containing a possible
transmembrane region and a potential tyrosine phosphorylation site.
MUC16 also has a high leucine content. Northern blot analysis showed
that the level of MUC16 mRNA correlated with the expression of CA125 in
a panel of cell lines.

Argueso et al. (2003) demonstrated that the membrane-associated mucin
MUC16 was expressed by the human ocular surface and that MUC16 carried
the H185 carbohydrate epitope. The authors proposed further studies on
the expression of MUC16 and the characterization of the molecular
structure of the H185 carbohydrate epitope to determine their biologic
significance on the healthy ocular surface and in dry eye syndrome.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Yin and Lloyd (2001) provisionally assigned the
MUC16 gene to chromosome 19.

615263	TITLE *615263 FAMILY WITH SEQUENCE SIMILARITY 86, MEMBER A; FAM86A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from a donor,
generally S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), to acceptor molecules,
including proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids, and small metabolites. FAM86A
belongs to a family of protein lysine methyltransferases that methylate
nonhistone proteins (Cloutier et al., 2013).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to METTL22 (615261),
Cloutier et al. (2013) identified FAM86A. The deduced protein is made up
predominantly of a Rossmann fold of alternating beta strands and alpha
helices, with a conserved AdoMet-binding site near the N terminus.
Epitope-tagged FAM86A was predominantly expressed in a diffuse
cytoplasmic distribution in transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By affinity purification, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry, Cloutier et
al. (2013) found that FAM86A expressed in HEK293 cells interacted with
FAM86B and FAM86C.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the FAM86A gene to chromosome 16p13.3 based on an
alignment of the FAM86A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY037162) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;TESTICAN 2;;
KIAA0275
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteoglycans, which consist of a core protein and covalently linked
glycosaminoglycans, are components of the extracellular matrix. SPOCK2
encodes a member of a novel Ca(2+)-binding proteoglycan family (summary
by Vannahme et al., 1999).

CLONING

By screening an immature myeloid cell line for cDNAs with the potential
to encode large proteins, Nagase et al. (1996) identified a SPOCK2 cDNA,
which they called KIAA0275, encoding a protein with sequence similarity
to testican (SPOCK1; 602264) and with a thyroglobulin type-1 repeat.
Northern blot analysis detected highest expression in brain, thymus, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

By screening a human brain cDNA library with a fragment of an EST
showing sequence similarity to the follistatin-like domain of a
BM-40/SPARC/osteonectin (182120), Vannahme et al. (1999) cloned a SPOCK2
cDNA, which they called testican-2, encoding a deduced precursor protein
of 424 amino acids with a 22-amino acid signal peptide and a calculated
molecular mass of 46.8 kD. The mature 402-amino acid protein has 5
domains: a follistatin-like domain, a Ca(2+)-binding domain, a
thyroglobulin-like domain, and a C-terminal region with 2 putative
glycosaminoglycan attachment sites. The SPOCK2 protein shares 43%
overall sequence identity with SPOCK1. Northern blot analysis of adult
mouse tissues revealed expression of a major 6.1-kb transcript at high
levels in brain and at low levels in lung and testis. Minor bands of 4.4
and 2.6 kb were also detected. In situ hybridization demonstrated
widespread expression in multiple neuronal cell types in olfactory bulb,
cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, cerebellum, pons, and medulla. A
recombinant fragment consisting of the Ca(2+)-binding EF-hand domain and
the thyroglobulin-like domain showed a reversible Ca(2+)-dependent
conformational change in circular dichroism studies.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the SPOCK2
gene to chromosome 10. By sequence analysis, Vannahme et al. (1999)
localized the gene to 10q21-q23.

607860	TITLE *607860 YY1 ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; YY1AP1
;;YY1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; YAP;;
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; HCCA2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display PCR of normal hepatic tissue and hepatocellular
carcinomas, followed by screening a placenta cDNA library, Wang et al.
(2001) cloned YY1AP1, which they called HCCA2. The deduced 467-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 50.65 kD. HCCA2 contains
2 SH3-binding domains, 2 N-glycosylation sites, 6 N-myristoylation
sites, and numerous phosphorylation sites, but it does not have a
transmembrane domain, signal peptide, or targeting sequences. Northern
blot analysis detected 1.8- and 2.5-kb transcripts in all adult tissues
examined except liver. Expression was also detected in fetal liver,
lung, brain, and spleen. Western blot analysis of transfected embryonic
kidney fibroblasts detected HCCA2 at an apparent molecular mass of about
50 kD. Immunohistochemical staining showed that HCCA2 protein was
localized in the cytoplasm of liver cancer tissues, and it was not found
in surrounding nontumor hepatocytes.

Kuryshev et al. (2006) determined that YY1AP1 was formed by fusion of
the 5-prime region of the ASH1L gene (607999) and the 3-prime region of
the GON4L gene (610393) during a tandem segmental duplication on
chromosome 1. YY1AP1 contains the partial promoter and untranslated
first exon of ASH1L and coding exons 13 to 21 of GON4L. The 3-prime
region of YY1AP1 originated from a long terminal repeat of an endogenous
retrovirus, known as the MER51A repeat, that was inserted into exon 21
of GON4L after the duplication. The deduced YY1AP1 protein contains 750
amino acids, 748 of which correspond to amino acids 590 to 1,337 of the
GON4L protein. The last 2 C-terminal residues of YY1AP1 come from the
long terminal repeat of MER51A. RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression of
YY1AP1, with highest levels in testis and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2001) determined that HCCA2 was not expressed in normal
adult liver tissue, but it was expressed in 79% of hepatocellular
carcinomas tested. HCCA2 expression was associated with invasion of the
tumor capsule.

614443	TITLE *614443 EBNA1-BINDING PROTEIN 2; EBNA1BP2
;;EBP2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

EBNA1BP2 binds to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA1),
the viral protein required for replication and stable maintenance of EBV
(Shire et al., 1999). EBNA1BP2 also functions in a dynamic scaffold for
ribosome biogenesis (Hirano et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a lymphocyte cDNA library to detect
EBNA1-interacting proteins, Shire et al. (1999) identified EBNA1BP2,
which they termed EBP2. The 306-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 35 kD. It contains coiled-coil and helix-loop-helix
domains.

By separating proteins in the ribonucleoprotein-containing nuclear
matrix fraction of HeLa cells, followed by peptide mass fingerprint
analysis, Hirano et al. (2009) identified EBNA1BP2. Fluorescence
microscopy localized EBNA1BP2 to nucleolus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Shire et al. (1999) confirmed that
EBP2 interacted with full-length EBNA1 containing a gly-ala repeat. EBP2
also bound DNA-bound EBNA1 in a 1-hybrid system. Shire et al. (1999)
concluded that the EBNA1-EBP2 interaction is important for stable
integration of EBV episomes during cell division, but not for
replication of the episomes.

Using RNA interference knockdown analysis in HeLa cells, Hirano et al.
(2009) found evidence suggesting that EBNA1BP2 and BXDC1 (RPF2) function
in a dynamic scaffold for ribosome biogenesis.

Huber et al. (2000) found that the N-terminal region of the yeast
homolog of EBP2 contains nucleolar-associated KKE motifs. Fluorescence
microscopy demonstrated nucleolar localization. Deletion analysis
revealed that the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal region of yeast
Ebp2 was required for protein activity. Mutants in Ebp2 were defective
in processing the 27 SA into the 27 SB precursor rRNA.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the EBNA1BP2 gene to chromosome 1p35-p33 based on an
alignment of the EBNA1BP2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC009175) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

603413	TITLE *603413 TIA1 CYTOTOXIC GRANULE-ASSOCIATED RNA-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 1; TIAL1
;;TIA1-RELATED PROTEIN; TIAR;;
T CLUSTER-BINDING PROTEIN; TCBP
DESCRIPTION Cytotoxic lymphocytes can induce target cells to activate apoptosis.
Central to this autolytic pathway is the activation of an endogenous
endonuclease that degrades target cell DNA. By screening a human
phytohemagglutinin-activated T-cell cDNA library with a TIA1 (603518)
cDNA, Kawakami et al. (1992) cloned a cDNA encoding TIA1-related protein
(TIAR). Both TIAR and TIA1 are members of a family of RNA-binding
proteins containing 3 RNA-binding domains and a C-terminal auxiliary
domain. Like TIA1, TIAR possesses a lysosome-targeting motif in its
C-terminal auxiliary domain, suggesting that TIAR is also a cytotoxic
granule-associated protein. The authors demonstrated that TIAR binds
specifically to poly(A) homopolymers, fragments DNA in permeabilized
target cells, and is expressed in a wide variety of hematopoietic and
nonhematopoietic cell types.

Using a Southwestern approach to identify proteins capable of binding to
the T cluster of the platelet factor-4 (PF4; 173460) promoter, Doi et
al. (1997) isolated a human erythroleukemia (HEL) cell cDNA encoding an
isoform of TIAL1, which they called TCBP. This deduced 265-amino acid
isoform differs from the isoform identified by Kawakami et al. (1992) at
the C terminus, where a hydrophobic sequence replaces the
lysosome-targeting motif. Doi et al. (1997) demonstrated that TCBP
specifically binds to the T cluster and the proximal T-rich region of
the PF4 promoter in vitro and that TCBP reduces gene expression from the
PF4 promoter. TCBP mRNA expression was reduced when HEL cells were
induced to differentiate to megakaryocytes.

By hybridization to YACs and radiation hybrid mapping, Doi et al. (1997)
localized the TIAL1 gene to 10q, 4.92 cR distal to WI-5255.

604142	TITLE *604142 TYRO PROTEIN TYROSINE KINASE-BINDING PROTEIN; TYROBP
;;DNAX-ACTIVATION PROTEIN 12; DAP12
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Natural killer (NK) cells express cell surface receptors that recognize
major histocompatibility complex class I peptides (e.g., 142800) and
inhibit NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. NK cell receptors belong to 2
distinct groups: the immunoglobulin superfamily for the killer cell
inhibitory receptors (KIRs; e.g., 602992), and the C-type lectin
superfamily for the NKG2 receptors (e.g., 161555). These inhibitory
receptors possess 'immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs'
(ITIMs) in their cytoplasmic domains that recruit SH2 domain-containing
protein-tyrosine phosphatases, resulting in inactivation of NK cells.
Certain isoforms of NK cell receptors lack ITIM sequences, and these
non-inhibitory receptors activate, rather than inhibit, NK cells. Cell
surface immunoglobulin receptors, T-cell antigen receptors (e.g.,
186880), and certain Fc receptors noncovalently associate with small
transmembrane proteins, such as CD3-delta (CD3D; 186790), -gamma (CD3G;
186740), -epsilon (CD3E; 186830), -zeta (CD3Z; 186780), CD79-alpha
(112205), -beta (147245), and FCER1G (147139), that contain an
'immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif' (ITAM) sequence and are
required for signal transduction by these receptor complexes. Lanier et
al. (1998) hypothesized that non-inhibitory NK cell receptors might
require an associated protein with similar properties to mediate
positive signal transduction. By searching an EST database with the
protein sequences of CD3D, CD3G, CD3E, CD3Z, and FCER1G, they isolated a
human CD1+ dendritic cell EST encoding an ITAM-containing protein, which
they named DAP12. The predicted 113-amino acid DAP12 protein is composed
of a signal peptide, a 14-amino acid extracellular domain, a
transmembrane segment, and a 48-amino acid cytoplasmic domain. Although
DAP12 shares less than 25% similarity with the human CD3D, CD3G, CD3E,
CD3Z, and FCER1G proteins, its cytoplasmic domain contains a sequence
that precisely corresponds to the prototype ITAM consensus. Potential
sites for phosphorylation are also present in the DAP12 cytoplasmic
region. The transmembrane domain of DAP12 contains the charged amino
acid aspartic acid, which is conserved in the transmembrane domain of
the CD3 subunits.

Tomasello et al. (1998) cloned the full-length coding sequence of mouse
Tyrobp, which they called Karap for 'killer cell-activating
receptor-associated protein.' The deduced human and mouse TYROBP
proteins are 73% identical and are more similar to CD3Z and FCER1G than
to other known ITAM-bearing molecules. RT-PCR analysis of a variety of
hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic mouse cell lines revealed almost
ubiquitous expression of Tyrobp.

GENE FUNCTION

Lanier et al. (1998) demonstrated that the DAP12 protein is expressed on
the cell surface as a disulfide-bonded homodimer. DAP12 noncovalently
associated with KIR2DS2, a KIR family member that lacks an ITIM.
Crosslinking of KIR2DS2/DAP12 complexes, but not of KIR2DS2 alone,
resulted in cellular activation, as indicated by tyrosine
phosphorylation of cellular proteins and upregulation of
early-activation antigens. In addition, crosslinking of KIR2DS2/DAP12
complexes induced tyrosine phosphorylation of DAP12 and resulted in the
association of phosphorylated DAP12 with the protein-tyrosine kinase SYK
(600085). Peptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of DAP12
formed complexes with the protein-tyrosine kinases SYK and ZAP70
(176947) only if the tyrosine residues in the ITAM of DAP12 were
phosphorylated. Northern blot analysis detected an abundant 0.7-kb DAP12
transcript in human peripheral blood leukocytes and spleen but not in
thymus or the other tissues examined. The authors found DAP12 expression
in human NK cell lines but not in a T leukemia cell line or a B
lymphoblastoid cell line. Lanier et al. (1998) suggested that DAP12
associates with the non-inhibitory isoforms of the KIR molecules in NK
cells and permits cellular activation through these receptors, in a way
similar to the function of the CD3 subunits in the T-cell receptor
complex and the CD79 subunits in the B-cell receptor complex.

DAP12 associates with the cell surface receptor TREM2 (605086), and the
DAP12-TREM2 complex is involved in dendritic cell maturation. Paloneva
et al. (2003) analyzed differentiation of peripheral blood mononuclear
cells from DAP12- and TREM2-deficient Finnish or German polycystic
lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy
(PLOSL; 221770) patients into osteoclasts. They found that homozygous
loss-of-function mutations in DAP12 or TREM2 resulted in inefficient,
aberrant, and delayed differentiation into osteoclasts and significantly
diminished bone resorption capability in vitro. RT-PCR analysis detected
no differences between patient and control cells in the expression of
several genes, but expression of DAP12 and TREM2 increased in control
cells during osteoclastic differentiation. Paloneva et al. (2003)
concluded that the DAP12-TREM2 signaling complex is important in the
differentiation and function of osteoclasts.

MAPPING

Lanier et al. (1998) stated that the human TYROBP genomic sequence is
contained within a cosmid (GenBank GENBANK AD000833) that maps to
19q13.1. By FISH, Tomasello et al. (1998) mapped the mouse Tyrobp gene
to 7B. They noted that human 19q13 shows homology of synteny with mouse
chromosome 7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing
leukoencephalopathy (PLOSL; 221770), also known as Nasu-Hakola disease,
is a recessively inherited disorder characterized by a combination of
psychotic symptoms rapidly progressing to presenile dementia and bone
cysts restricted to wrists and ankles. Identification of a shared 153-kb
ancestor haplotype in all Finnish disease alleles on 19q13.1 was the
first step in characterizing the molecular defect. The TYROBP gene was
one of those located in the critical DNA region for PLOSL. Paloneva et
al. (2000) failed to obtain products by PCR amplification of the coding
region of TYROBP in the genomic DNA of Finnish PLOSL patients with
primers flanking exons 1-4, whereas exon 5 was amplified normally. This
indicated that the patients carried a homozygous deletion encompassing
exons 1-4 of TYROBP (604142.0001). They located the 5-prime deletion
breakpoint 2,900 bp upstream of the initiation methionine, and the
3-prime breakpoint in the last intron of TYROBP, 1,300 bp upstream of
the termination codon. Sequence analysis of the 342-bp coding region of
TYROBP from the genomic DNA of a Japanese PLOSL patient demonstrated
homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion in exon 3 (604142.0002). This mutation
created a frameshift in the open reading frame, predicting premature
termination of the polypeptide chain after 52 amino acids. The mutation
also changed the aspartic acid residue in the transmembrane domain that
is essential in mediating the interaction between the TYROBP homodimer
and the associated ligand-binding receptors on the surface of natural
killer (NK) cells. On the plasma membrane of NK cells, TYROBP associates
with activating receptors recognizing major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class III molecules. No abnormalities in NK cell function were
detected in PLOSL patients homozygous for a null allele of TYROBP. In 1
Norwegian and 1 Swedish patient with the typical clinical features of
PLOSL, linkage to 19q13.1 was excluded, and no sign of mutation of
TYROBP was found in them or their families.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kaifu et al. (2003) noted that DAP12 is expressed in the
monocyte-macrophage lineage, and that osteoclasts and microglial cells
share a myeloid origin, providing a link between lesions in the brain
and bone in patients with presenile dementia with bone cysts due to
mutation in the DAP12 gene. In Dap12 -/- mice, Kaifu et al. (2003) found
progressive osteopetrosis beginning at about 6 weeks of age. Bone marrow
cells of Dap12 -/- mice failed to yield mature or functional osteoclasts
in vitro. Brain sections from mutant mice showed hypomyelinosis,
synaptic degeneration, and immature oligodendrocytes in the region of
the thalamus. The Dap12 -/- mice showed a reduced startle reflex in
response to acoustic stimuli and reduced prepulse inhibition, suggesting
an impairment of sensorimotor gating. Northern blot analysis of brain
tissue from wildtype mice detected Dap12 mRNA in oligodendrocytes and
microglial cells, but not in astrocytes or neurons.

Koga et al. (2004) showed that mice lacking immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-harboring adaptors Fc receptor
common gamma subunit (147139) and DAP12 exhibit severe osteopetrosis
owing to impaired osteoclast differentiation. In osteoclast precursor
cells, Fc receptor-gamma and DAP12 associated with multiple
immunoreceptors and activated calcium signaling through phospholipase
C-gamma (see 172420). Thus, ITAM-dependent costimulatory signals
activated by multiple immunoreceptors are essential for the maintenance
of bone homeostasis. Koga et al. (2004) concluded that RANKL (602642)
and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (120420) are not sufficient to
activate the signals required for osteoclastogenesis.

Hamerman et al. (2005) found that macrophages from Dap12-deficient mice
produced more Tnf (191160), Il6 (147620), and Il12b (161561) after
stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs; see 603030) with various
pathogen products than did macrophages from wildtype mice. Inflammatory
cytokine production returned to wildtype levels after Dap12
reconstitution, but not after reconstitution with Dap12 lacking the
ITAM. Macrophages lacking Syk, which signals downstream of Dap12, showed
a phenotype identical to that of Dap12-deficient macrophages.
Dap12-deficient mice produced Tnf at the same rate as wildtype mice but
at higher levels in response to treatment with lipopolysaccharide
combined with the Tnf-sensitizing agent D-galactosamine, and none
survived endotoxic shock. Three days after infection with Listeria
monocytogenes, Dap12-deficient mice had substantially fewer bacteria in
spleen and liver compared with wildtype mice. Hamerman et al. (2005)
proposed that 1 or more DAP12-pairing receptors negatively regulate
signaling through TLRs. They noted that Nasu-Hakola patients are not
immunodeficient and, based on their findings, suggested that these
patients may have enhanced resistance to certain pathogens.

In contrast to the findings of Hamerman et al. (2005), Turnbull et al.
(2005) found that Dap12 -/- mice were less susceptible to septic shock
induced by simple endotoxemia or cecal ligation and puncture than
wildtype mice. They concluded that, during sepsis, DAP12 signaling
augments the response to microbial products, amplifying inflammation and
contributing to mortality.

Turnbull et al. (2006) found that mice lacking Trem2 were unable to
inhibit cytokine production in response to microbial products. There was
no difference in cytokine production by macrophages from Trem2-deficient
mice and Dap12-deficient mice, leading Turnbull et al. (2006) to
conclude that Trem2 is the receptor operative in the increased
macrophage cytokine production observed in Dap12-deficient cells.

In all 26 Finnish patients with PLOSL (221770) as well as in 2 Swedish
patients with known ancestors in Finland, Paloneva et al. (2000) found
homozygosity for a genomic deletion of 5,265 bp, including 343 bp (exons
1-4 and 5-prime untranslated region) of the 604-bp transcribed region of
the TYROBP gene.

created a frameshift in the open reading frame, predicting premature

In 2 unrelated Japanese patients with PLOSL (221770), both born to

the second nucleotide of the TYROBP gene, changing the start codon from
ATG (met) to ACG (thr). The patients had developed neuropsychiatric
signs at age 30 to 35 years and both had x-ray signs of bone cysts.

603071	TITLE *603071 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 17; GPR17
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily contain 7
transmembrane domains and transduce extracellular signals through
heterotrimeric G proteins. By PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides
based on regions conserved between IL8RA (146929) and the angiotensin II
chemokine GPCR (106165), Raport et al. (1996) isolated the GPR17 gene,
which they called R12. Independently, Blasius et al. (1998) used RT-PCR
to identify novel P2 nucleotide (P2Y) GPCRs (see 601167) and isolated
GPR17 cDNAs. They identified 2 GPR17 splice variants, designated HIP4
and FB1, which encode predicted proteins of 339 and 367 amino acids,
respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that human GPR17 is
expressed as 2.3- and 6.3-kb mRNAs exclusively in brain. The 2
transcripts appear to represent alternatively polyadenylated variants.
Based on protein sequence homology and the conservation of certain key
residues, GPR17 appears to be closely related to the P2Y family of
GPCRs. However, Blasius et al. (1998) stated that preliminary functional
data did not support the hypothesis that classical P2Y agonists serve as
ligands for this receptor.

GENE FUNCTION

Ciana et al. (2006) expressed GPR17 in different cell lines and found
that stimulation with both uracil nucleotides and cysteinyl-leukotrienes
(CysLTs) resulted in specific and concentration-dependent responses. In
vivo, knockdown of Gpr17 by either CysLT receptor (CYSLTR1; 300201) or
P2Y receptor (e.g., P2RY12; 600515) antagonists or by antisense
technology prevented evolution of brain damage in a rat focal ischemia
model. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of GPR17 in human and rat
organs prone to ischemic damage, including brain, kidney, and heart.
GPR17 appeared to possess 2 distinct binding sites, one for nucleotides
and the other for CysLTs. Ciana et al. (2006) concluded that GPR17 is a
common molecular target that may mediate ischemia and inflammatory
effects induced by nucleotides and CysLTs.

Using mouse cDNAs, Maekawa et al. (2009) showed that Gpr17 downregulated
the function, but not the membrane localization, of the cysteinyl
leukotriene receptor Cyslt1r (CYSLTR1; 300201). Cotransfection of Gpr17
with Cyslt1r suppressed LTD4 binding and inhibited Cyslt1r-mediated Erk
(see MAPK1; 176948) phosphorylation in response to LTD4.
Coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed that Gpr17 and Cyslt1r interacted
directly. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed colocalization
of GPR17 and CYSLT1R on the surface of human peripheral blood monocytes.
Silencing of Gpr17 in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages increased
Cyslt1r membrane expression and increased the magnitude and sensitivity
to LTD4-induced calcium flux. Gpr17 deficiency in mice increased
Cyslt1r-mediated vascular permeability in IgE-dependent mast
cell-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. The vascular leak in
Gpr17-deficient mice was markedly and significantly suppressed by
pharmacologic inhibition of Cyslt1r. Maekawa et al. (2009) concluded
that GPR17 functions as a negative regulator of CYSLT1R.

Mouse hypothalamic neurons expressing Agrp (602311) are involved in
feeding behavior. Ren et al. (2012) found that ablation of Foxo1
(136533) specifically in Agrp-positive hypothalamic neurons resulted in
reduced food intake, leanness, improved glucose homeostasis, and
increased sensitivity to leptin and insulin in mice. Quantitative PCR
and microarray analysis showed that Gpr17 was highly expressed in
Agrp-positive mouse neurons and that Gpr17 expression increased during
fasting. Gpr17 expression was decreased in Foxo1-deficient Agrp-positive
neurons. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that Foxo1
bound the Gpr17 promoter. Ren et al. (2012) concluded that
downregulation of Gpr17, at least in part, mediates the anorexigenic
phenotype of Foxo1-deficient Agrp-positive neurons.

GENE STRUCTURE

Blasius et al. (1998) noted that the organization of the GPR17 gene
differs from that of many other GPCRs in that the ORF is distributed on
2 exons, with an additional exon containing the 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Raport et al. (1996) mapped the R12
gene to chromosome 2. Blasius et al. (1998) regionalized the HIP4/FB1
gene to chromosome 2q21 using fluorescence in situ hybridization.

DESCRIPTION Heat-shock proteins, or stress proteins, are expressed in response to
heat shock and a variety of other stress stimuli including oxidative
free radicals and toxic metal ions. The human HSP70, or HSPA, multigene
family encodes several highly conserved 70-kD proteins with structural
and functional properties in common, but which vary in their
inducibility in response to metabolic stress. Sargent et al. (1989)
identified a duplicated HSP70 locus in the class III region of the major
histocompatibility complex on 6p21.3. These loci, HSP70-1 (HSPA1A;
140550) and HSP70-2 (HSPA1B), are 12 kb apart and lie 92 kb telomeric to
the C2 gene (613927). Milner and Campbell (1990) determined that the
HSP70-2 gene, like HSP70-1, lacks introns. The HSP70-1 and -2 coding
sequences, which differ by 8 bp that do not alter the derived amino acid
sequence, encode identical 641-amino acid proteins; the 3-prime
untranslated regions of these genes are completely divergent. Northern
blot analysis of HeLa cell RNA detected an approximately 2.4-kb HSP70-2
transcript that was expressed at elevated levels following heat shock.

Milner and Campbell (1992) investigated the presence of sequence
variation in the HSP70-2 gene among different HLA haplotypes. They found
only very limited sequence variation, which did not result in amino acid
substitutions.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hematopoietic precursor cells migrate to the thymus, where they
differentiate into mature T lymphocytes. Aurrand-Lions et al. (1996)
reported the cDNA cloning and functional analysis of mouse vanin-1
(vascular noninflammatory molecule-1), a novel cell surface molecule
that is involved in the thymus homing of bone marrow cells. Vanin-1 is a
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored molecule expressed by
perivascular thymic stromal cells. Antibody against vanin-1 blocked
thymus colonization by hematopoietic progenitor cells in both short- and
long-term assays and interfered with lymphostromal cell adhesion. The
authors suggested that vanin-1 regulates late adhesion steps of thymus
homing under physiologic, noninflammatory conditions.

By searching an EST database with mouse vanin-1 and human vanin-2 (VNN2;
603571) cDNA sequences, Galland et al. (1998) identified cDNAs encoding
human vanin-1 (VNN1). The deduced 513-amino acid VNN1 protein shares
78%, 64%, and 43% sequence identity with mouse vanin-1, VNN2, and
biotinidase (609019), respectively. Like mouse vanin-1, human VNN1 has a
leader peptide and a C-terminal GPI cleavage motif. VNN1 protein
translated in vitro migrated as 55- and 53-kD polypeptides. Northern
blot analysis revealed that the 3.4-kb VNN1 mRNA is expressed in spleen,
thymus, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and small intestine; minor
transcripts were also detected.

Martin et al. (2001) found that the vanin family is encoded by at least
2 mouse genes, vanin-1 and vanin-3, and 3 human orthologous genes, VNN1,
VNN2, and VNN3 (606592). They showed that the vanin genes encode
different isoforms of the mammalian pantetheinase activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Martin et al. (2001) reported the structural characterization of the
human and mouse vanin genes. All contain 7 exons.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Galland et al. (1998) mapped the mouse vanin-1
gene to the proximal third of chromosome 10, which shows homology of
synteny with human 6q21-q24. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization
and analysis of somatic cell hybrids, they localized the human VNN1 gene
to 6q23-q24. Galland et al. (1998) identified a YAC clone from 6q23-q24
that contained both the VNN1 and VNN2 genes.

Martin et al. (2001) found that the 3 human vanin genes are closely
linked on 6q23-q24 and are aligned in the same transcriptional
orientation. The 2 mouse vanin genes are located on chromosome 10A2B1.

GENE FUNCTION

The mouse vanin-1 molecule plays a role in thymic reconstitution
following damage by irradiation. Pitari et al. (2000) demonstrated that
the mouse vanin-1 molecule is a pantetheinase, i.e., an amidohydrolase
that catalyzes the hydrolysis of D-pantetheine, permitting the recycling
of pantothenate (vitamin B5) and the generation of an antioxidant
metabolite, cysteamine.

The mammalian sex-determining pathway is controlled by the presence or
absence of SRY (480000) expression in the embryonic gonad. To identify
additional sex-determining or gonadal differentiation genes, Grimmond et
al. (2000) screened for genes exhibiting sexually dimorphic patterns of
expression in the mouse gonad at 12.5 and 13.5 days postcoitum, after
overt gonad differentiation, by comparing complex cDNA probes derived
from male and female gonadal tissue at these stages on microarrays
constructed from a normalized urogenital ridge library. Using in situ
hybridization analysis, they determined that mouse protease nexin-1
(177010) and Vnn1 exhibit male-specific expression prior to overt
gonadal differentiation and are detected in the somatic portion of the
developing gonad, suggesting to the authors a possible direct link to
the testis-determining pathway for both genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Quantitative differences in gene expression are thought to contribute to
phenotypic differences between individuals. Goring et al. (2007)
generated genomewide transcriptional profiles of lymphocyte samples from
1,240 participants in the San Antonio Family Heart Study. Evidence of
significant heritability was found for the expression levels of 85% of
the 19,648 detected autosomal transcripts. By linkage analysis, the
authors uncovered more than 1,000 cis-regulated transcripts and showed
that the expression quantitative trait loci with the most significant
linkage evidence are often located at the structural locus of a given
transcript. To highlight the usefulness of this much-enlarged map of
cis-regulated transcripts for the discovery of genes that influence
complex traits in humans, Goring et al. (2007) selected high density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) concentration as a phenotype of clinical
importance, and identified the cis-regulated VNN1 gene as harboring
sequence variants that influence HDLC concentrations. Several VNN1
promoter variants showed highly significant association with HDLC
concentration. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that one of these, the
-137T allele (603570.0001), is embedded in a consensus Sp1 binding site.
This and other information provided indirect support for functionality
of this promoter variant.

ANIMAL MODEL

Martin et al. (2004) generated Vnn1-deficient mice that lacked free
cysteamine and examined their susceptibility to intestinal inflammation,
either acute (NSAID administration) or chronic (Schistosoma mansoni
infection). They found that Vnn1 -/- mice better controlled inflammatory
reaction and intestinal injury in both experiments, and had increased
gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (see 606857) activity and increased
stores of reduced glutathione, as well as reduced inflammatory cell
activation in inflamed tissues. Oral administration of cystamine
reversed all aspects of the deficient phenotype. Martin et al. (2004)
concluded that the pantetheinase activity of the vanin-1 molecule is a
major regulator of intestinal inflammation, acting through cysteamine
release.

600435	TITLE *600435 CARDIOTROPHIN 1; CTF1
;;CT1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. A hallmark of
the disease is dilated cardiac hypertrophy, which is accompanied by a
reactivation of genes expressed in fetal heart development. Reasoning
that fetal or embryonic growth factors may mediate the onset of cardiac
hypertrophy, Pennica et al. (1995) coupled expression cloning with an
embryonic stem cell-based model of cardiogenesis to isolate a 21.5-kD
protein, cardiotrophin-1, that potently induces cardiac myocyte
hypertrophy in vitro. Amino acid similarity data indicated that CT1 is a
member of the family of cytokines that includes leukemia inhibitory
factor (LIF; 159540), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF; 118945),
oncostatin M (OSM; 165095), interleukin-6 (IL6; 147620), and
interleukin-11 (IL11; 147681). Several members of this family that are
known to signal through the transmembrane protein gp130 (IL6ST; 600694)
stimulate cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, like cardiotrophin-1, suggesting
that the gp130 signaling pathway may play a role in cardiac hypertrophy.
The 1.4-kb CT1 mRNA is present in the heart and several other mouse
tissues.

By screening a heart cDNA library with a mouse Ct1 probe, Pennica et al.
(1996) isolated a cDNA encoding human CTF1. The deduced CTF1 protein
contains 201 amino acids and shares 80% amino acid identity with the
203-amino acid mouse Ct1 sequence; however, unlike the mouse protein,
CTF1 has 2 rather than 1 cys and has no N-glycosylation site. Although
other gp130-signaling cytokines have similar structures with 4 alpha
helices, they share only 14 to 23% identity with CTF1. Despite lacking a
signal sequence, secreted CTF1 and mouse Ct1 induce cardiac myocyte
hypertrophy in cell culture and bind to both mouse and human LIFR
(151443) but not to OSMR (601743). Northern blot analysis detected a
1.7-kb CTF1 transcript at high levels in heart, skeletal muscle,
prostate, and ovary. Low levels were detected in lung, kidney, pancreas,
thymus, testis, and small intestine, with little or no expression
detected in brain, placenta, spleen, colon, and peripheral blood
leukocytes. Pennica et al. (1996) also observed strong expression in
fetal lung and kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pennica et al. (1996) determined by genomic analysis that the CTF1 gene
contains 3 exons and spans over 6 to 7 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in situ hybridization and RT-PCR, Pennica et al. (1996) detected
mouse Ctf1 expression in embryonic limb bud at high levels during
motoneuron death and markedly reduced after the period of motoneuron
cell death. Pennica et al. (1996) concluded that Ctf1 expression is
consistent with a role for Ctf1 in regulating motoneuron numbers during
development. Western blot analysis demonstrated that myotubes in culture
secrete a Ctf1 gene product with an apparent molecular weight of 30 kD.

Using a purified motoneuron culture system, Pennica et al. (1996)
demonstrated that Ctf1 is a potent long-term survival factor for a
fraction of motoneurons similar to those kept alive in culture by CNTF
or LIF. The authors also demonstrated that Ctf1 keeps lesioned
motoneurons alive in vivo after neonatal axotomy. They observed a
reduction in Ctf1-dependent motoneuron survival in culture upon
treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (see
600220). Because phospholipase C can specifically cleave the GPI linkage
that attaches certain molecules to the cell surface, Pennica et al.
(1996) hypothesized that the Ctf1 receptor, like the CNTFR (118946), has
an essential GPI-linked component. Several methods were unable to detect
binding of Ctf1 to GPI-linked CNTFR alpha-subunit and hypothesized that
the GPI-linked component of the Ctf1 receptor complex on motoneurons may
therefore be a novel cytokine receptor subunit. Pennica et al. (1996)
hypothesized that Ctf1 may be important in normal motoneuron development
and as a potential tool for slowing motoneuron degeneration in human
diseases.

Development of the cerebral cortex is achieved through a common pool of
precursor cells that sequentially generate neurons and glial cells.
Barnabe-Heider et al. (2005) demonstrated that murine cortical neurons
synthesized and secreted cardiotrophin-1, which acted as gliotrophic
factor and activated the gp130-JAK (147795)-STAT (102582) pathway.
Secretion of Ctf1 was essential for the timed genesis of astrocytes as
shown in vitro and in vivo. The findings described a neural feedback
mechanism ensuring that gliogenesis does not occur until neurogenesis is
largely complete.

MAPPING

By FISH and radiation hybrid analysis, Pennica et al. (1996) mapped the
CTF1 gene to 16p11.2-p11.1, a location distinct from other IL6 cytokine
family members.

Derouet et al. (2004) determined that the mouse Ctf1 gene maps to
chromosome 7F3 in tandem with the neuropoietin gene (Np). The authors
suggested that Ctf1 and Np arose from a gene duplication event. In
human, NP has evolved into a pseudogene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; 105400) is a mainly sporadic
neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of cortical and spinal
motoneurons. Some familial ALS (FALS) cases have been linked to dominant
mutations in the gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1;
147450). Transgenic mice overexpressing a mutated form of human SOD1
with a gly93-to-ala substitution (147450.0008) develop progressive
muscle wasting and paralysis as a result of spinal motoneuron loss and
die at 5 to 6 months. Bordet et al. (2001) investigated the effects of
neurotrophic factor gene delivery in this FALS model. Intramuscular
injection of an adenoviral vector encoding CTF1 in SOD1(G93A) newborn
mice delayed the onset of motor impairment as assessed in the rotarod
test. By CTF1 treatment, axonal degeneration was slowed, skeletal muscle
atrophy was largely reduced, and the time-course of motor impairment was
significantly decreased.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA1; 253300) is an autosomal recessive
disorder characterized by degeneration of lower motor neurons caused by
mutations of the survival motor neuron gene (SMN1; 600354).
Conditionally mutant mice homozygous for a deletion of Smn exon 7
(directed to neurons) display skeletal muscle denervation, moderate loss
of motor neuron cell bodies, and severe axonal degeneration. Lesbordes
et al. (2003) reported therapeutic benefits of systemic delivery of
CTF1. Intramuscular injection of adenoviral vector expressing CTF1, even
at very low dose, improved median survival, delayed motor defect, and
exerted a protective effect against loss of proximal motor axons and
aberrant cytoskeletal organization of motor synaptic terminals. In spite
of the severity of SMA phenotype in mutant mice, CTF1 was able to slow
disease progression.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NFE2-binding sites and Maf recognition elements (MAREs) are essential
cis-acting elements in the regulatory regions of erythroid-specific
genes recognized by the erythroid transcription factor NFE2, which is
composed of p45 (NFE2; 601490) and a small MAF protein (e.g., MAFK;
600197). The p45 subunit and p45-related factors, such as NFE2L3,
contain a cap'n'collar (CNC)-type basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain and
are collectively grouped as the CNC family. CNC factors bind to MARE
through heterodimer formation with small Maf proteins (summary by
Kobayashi et al., 1999).

CLONING

Kobayashi et al. (1999) searched a human EST database for novel CNC
factors and identified an EST clone encoding an amino acid sequence
similar to that of NRF1 (NFE2L1; 163260). They isolated cDNAs
corresponding to this EST by screening a human placenta cDNA library
with the EST. The cDNA sequence encodes a 694-amino acid polypeptide,
NFE2L3, which the authors called NRF3. NRF3 contains a bZIP domain that
is similar to those of other CNC transcription factors. Northern blot
analysis detected 2 human NRF3 transcripts in all tissues examined, with
the highest levels in placenta. NRF3 was expressed in B-cell and
monocytic cell lines but not in T-cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Kobayashi et al. (1999) demonstrated that mouse Nrf3 could bind to a
MARE as a heterodimer with Mafk and that Nrf3 functioned as a
transcriptional activator.

MAPPING

By FISH, Kobayashi et al. (1999) mapped the NFE2L3 gene to chromosome
7p15-p14, near the HOXA gene cluster (see 142955).

ANIMAL MODEL

Chevillard et al. (2011) stated that Nrf3 deletion in mice causes no
obvious abnormalities. However, they found that Nrf3 -/- mice were more
sensitive than wildtype mice to the carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene, which is
found in cigarette smoke. Benzo(a)pyrene, delivered weekly by gavage
over 4 weeks, caused premature death in 6 (32%) of 19 of Nrf3 -/- mice,
but in only 1 (6%) of 16 wildtype animals. All Nrf3 -/- animals that
died had lymphomas originating mostly from thymus, with a few
originating from spleen, and a majority exhibited metastasis to the
lung. Chevillard et al. (2011) concluded that NRF3 is a tumor suppressor
transcription factor that is protective against hematopoietic
malignancies.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By 2-dimensional electrophoresis of nuclear matrix proteins from various
types of human cells, Holzmann et al. (1998) detected a common nuclear
matrix protein that they designated NMP238. Using a partial protein
sequence, they searched an EST database and identified a cDNA encoding
NMP238. The calculated molecular mass and pI of the predicted 456-amino
acid protein were close to the experimentally determined values of 54 kD
and 6.5. By immunofluorescence, Holzmann et al. (1998) determined that
NMP238 is found primarily in the nucleus, although it is also present in
the cytoplasm. The NMP238 staining pattern appeared as punctate signals
in both in situ prepared nuclear matrices and in the nucleoplasm of
whole cells. Northern blot and RNA dot blot analysis revealed that
NMP238 is expressed ubiquitously as an approximately 1.8-kb mRNA.

Bacterial RuvB proteins function as DNA helicases that promote branch
migration of Holliday junctions that form during genetic recombination.
Independently, Qiu et al. (1998) isolated NMP238 cDNAs, designating the
protein RUVBL1 (E. coli RuvB-like-1). They reported that RUVBL1 has
homology to bacterial RuvB proteins. The regions of homology contained,
among other motifs, Walker A and B motifs characteristic of DNA/RNA
helicases.

Makino et al. (1998) identified RUVBL1 as the human homolog of rat
TIP49, a 49-kD TATA box-binding protein (TBP; 600075)-interacting
protein. Rat and human TIP49 differ at only 1 amino acid position.

Bauer et al. (1998) demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy that
RUVBL1 is present in small dot-like structures in the nucleus but not in
nucleoli.

GENE FUNCTION

Qiu et al. (1998) found that RUVBL1 coimmunoprecipitated with several
cellular proteins and was present in the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme
complex purified over multiple chromatographic steps. Qiu et al. (1998)
identified 2 S. cerevisiae RuvB homologs, scRuvBL1 and scRuvBL2, which
share 70% and 42% protein sequence identity with RUVBL1, respectively.
They determined that scRuvBL1 is essential for viability in yeast.

Wood et al. (2000) used the MYC (190080) transactivation domain to
affinity purify tightly associated nuclear proteins. They identified 2
of these proteins as RUVBL1 and a novel related protein, RUVBL2
(604788). RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 are both highly conserved in evolution and
contain ATPase/helicase motifs. The authors showed that RUVBL1 and
RUVBL2 are complexed with MYC in vivo and that binding is dependent on a
MYC domain essential for oncogenic activity. A missense mutation in the
RUVBL1 ATPase motif acted as a dominant inhibitor of MYC oncogenic
activity but did not inhibit normal cell growth, indicating that
functional RUVBL1 protein is an essential mediator of MYC oncogenic
transformation. Wood et al. (2000) concluded that the RUVBL1 and RUVBL2
ATPase/helicase proteins represent a class of cofactors recruited by
transcriptional activation domains that function in diverse pathways.

Using the N-terminal 284 amino acids of beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806),
Bauer et al. (1998) identified RUVBL1, which they termed pontin-52, as a
52-kD binding partner of CTNNB1. Using binding analysis, they confirmed
that RUVBL1 serves as a bridge between CTNNB1 (residues 187-284) and TBP
as predicted by sequence analysis. Bauer et al. (1998) also observed
interaction between RUVBL1 and the CTNNB1-lymphoid enhancer-binding
factor-1 (LEF1; 153245) complex.

Hawley et al. (2001) identified TIP49 as a plasminogen (173350)-binding
protein on the surface of a monocytic cell line. Monocytic cells treated
with carboxypeptidase B (CPB1; 114852) lost the ability to bind and
activate plasminogen, and TIP49 was found to be the plasminogen-binding
protein altered by the CPB1 treatment. With use of recombinant rat TIP49
in an in vitro binding assay, Hawley et al. (2001) confirmed binding of
plasminogen to immobilized TIP49. They demonstrated activation of
TIP49-bound plasminogen by cleavage of a plasmin substrate.

The NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex is responsible for
acetylation of the N-terminal tails of histone H4 (see 602822) and H2A
(see 613499) in yeast. Its catalytic subunit, Esa1, is homologous to
human TIP60 (HTATIP; 601409). Using affinity purification, Western blot
analysis, cell fractionation, immunoprecipitation, and mass
spectrometry, Doyon et al. (2004) found that TIP60 and its splice
variant, TIP60B/PLIP, were part of a multisubunit NuA4 complex with HAT
activity in several human cell lines. They identified RUVBL1 as 1 of 3
subunits specific to the human NuA4 HAT complex.

Using RNA interference in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, Fazzio et al.
(2008) found that depletion of any of 7 components of the Tip60-p400
(EP400; 606265) HAT and nucleosome remodeling complex, including Ruvbl1,
caused the same phenotype. Unlike normal ES cells, which grow in
spherical 3-dimensional colonies, ES cells depleted of any the 7
Tip60-p400 HAT components showed a flattened and elongated morphology,
with monolayer growth and reduced cell-cell contacts. These knockdown
cells continued to cycle, with reduced cells in S phase and increased
cells in G2 phase. The effect of Tip60-p400 HAT component knockdown was
unique to ES cells, as negligible changes were observed following
knockdown in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

Makino et al. (1998) detected a high level of autoantibodies against
TIP49 in sera of patients with the autoimmune diseases
polymyositis/dermatomyositis and autoimmune hepatitis.

Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex consisting of a protein
subunit, TERT (187270), an RNA subunit, TERC (602322), and the
TERC-binding protein dyskerin (DKC1; 300126). Using affinity
chromatography and mass spectrometry, Venteicher et al. (2008)
identified pontin and reptin (RUVBL2) as components of the telomerase
complex in HeLa cells. Pontin interacted directly with both TERT and
dyskerin. The amount of TERT bound to pontin and reptin peaked in S
phase. Depletion of pontin and reptin impaired telomerase RNP
accumulation, indicating an essential role for these proteins in
telomerase assembly.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Qiu et al. (1998) mapped the
RUVBL1 gene to chromosome 3q21.

613903	TITLE *613903 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 540; ZNF540
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZNF540 belongs to a large family of transcription factors characterized
by an N-terminal Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain and tandem
C-terminal C2H2-type zinc fingers (Qi et al., 2006).

CLONING

Using degenerate primers based on conserved sequences of KRAB
domain-containing zinc finger proteins to screen a 20-week-old embryonic
human heart cDNA library, followed by EST database analysis and 5-prime
and 3-prime RACE, Xiang et al. (2006) cloned ZNF540. The deduced
660-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 77.1 kD. It
has an N-terminal KRAB-A domain, followed by 17 tandem Kruppel C2H2-type
zinc fingers. Northern blot analysis detected variable ZNF540 expression
in all fetal tissues examined. Fluorescence-tagged ZNF540 localized to
both cytoplasm and nuclei of transfected COS-7 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By cotransfecting COS-7 cells with ZNF540 and a reporter gene system,
Xiang et al. (2006) showed that ZNF540 repressed serum response element
(SRE)- and ELK1 (311040)-mediated transcriptional activation, suggesting
that it functions in the MAP kinase (see 176948) signal transduction
pathway. Deletion analysis identified the KRAB-A domain of ZNF540 as the
main repressive domain. Small interfering RNA directed against ZNF540
reduced the transcriptional repression by ZNF540.

GENE STRUCTURE

Xiang et al. (2006) determined that the ZNF540 gene contains 5 exons and
spans approximately 62.8 kb.

MAPPING

Xiang et al. (2006) mapped the ZNF540 gene to chromosome 19q13.13 by
genomic sequence analysis.

300482	TITLE *300482 GRB2-ASSOCIATED BINDING PROTEIN 3; GAB3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to GAB1 (604439),
followed by screening dendritic cell and eosinophil cDNA libraries, Wolf
et al. (2002) cloned GAB3. The deduced 586-amino acid protein contains
an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and potential SH2- and
SH3-binding motifs. The PH domains of GAB1, GAB2 (606203), and GAB3
share about 50% amino acid identity, while the remainder of the proteins
share about 14% identity. Wolf et al. (2002) also cloned mouse Gab3,
which encodes a deduced 595-amino acid protein. RT-PCR detected mouse
Gab3 expressed at high levels in spleen and thymus and at lower levels
in brain, heart, lung, kidney, uterus, and embryonic stem cells, but not
in other tissues examined. Gab3 was expressed in all myeloid and
macrophage cell lines examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Wolf et al. (2002) examined the role of Gab3 in macrophage
differentiation and signal transduction using a mouse myeloid progenitor
cell line exogenously expressing Fms (164770), the receptor for
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF; 120420). Gab3 was tyrosine
phosphorylated following receptor stimulation, and it associated
transiently with the SH2 domain-containing proteins Shp2 (176876) and
p85 of the PI3K complex (see 171833). Overexpression of exogenous Gab3
dramatically accelerated macrophage differentiation upon MCSF
stimulation. Examination of phosphorylation mutants suggested that Gab3
is important for macrophage differentiation and that differentiation
requires the early phosphorylation of Gab2, followed by induction and
subsequent phosphorylation of Gab3.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GAB3
gene to chromosome X (TMAP RH80611).

ANIMAL MODEL

Seiffert et al. (2003) found normal hematopoiesis in mice lacking Gab3,
and macrophages developed in normal numbers and exhibited normal
function. Gab3-deficient mice had no major immune deficiency in T- and
B-lymphocyte responses to protein antigens or during viral infection.
Allergic responses also appeared normal.

607177	TITLE *607177 IMMEDIATE-EARLY RESPONSE GENE 5; IER5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Williams et al. (1999) cloned a novel member of the slow-kinetics
immediate-early response gene family, designated Ier5, from a mouse
brain cDNA library. Mouse Ier5 encodes a deduced 308-amino acid protein
with a predicted molecular mass of 31.9 kD. The N-terminal 49 amino
acids show 57% sequence identity with those of the Ier2 protein. Ier5
contains 3 potential nuclear targeting signals, a possible PEST
sequence, which suggests rapid protein degradation, and several
potential phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis of total
cellular RNA from serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells showed no detectable
transcription in quiescent cells, but detected a single transcript
within 30 minutes after exposure to serum. Transcription was also
stimulated by the growth factors TPA (173370), FGF (see 131220), and
PDGF (see 173430), and did not appear to be dependent on protein kinase
C (see 176960) activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Williams et al. (1999) identified 2 possible Ets-1 sites, a number of
potential Sp1 sites, and 3 potential AP1-binding sites in the promoter
region of the mouse Ier5 gene. The IER5 genes in humans and mice are
highly homologous to their counterpart in zebrafish. In all of these
organisms, IER5 is an intronless gene (Gottgens et al., 2002).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the IER5
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG23644).

PROGESTIN-INDUCED PROTEIN;;
HYPERPLASTIC DISCS, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; HYD;;
KIAA0896
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from an adult brain cDNA library, Nagase
et al. (1998) cloned KIAA0896. The deduced protein contains 1,230 amino
acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected expression in all tissues and specific
brain regions examined. Highest expression was in ovary, thalamus, and
spinal cord, and lowest expression was in pancreas and spleen.

By differential display to identify progestin-induced genes expressed in
breast cancer cells, followed by 5-prime RACE and screening of heart and
placenta cDNA libraries, Callaghan et al. (1998) cloned EDD (E3
identified by differential display). The deduced 2,799-amino acid
protein contains 2 putative nuclear localization signals, a region
sharing homology with polyadenylate-binding proteins (see 604679), and a
C-terminal HECT domain, which contains a conserved cysteine that binds
ubiquitin via a thioester linkage. Northern blot analysis detected a
9.5-kb transcript in all tissues examined. RNA dot blot analysis found
highest expression in testis, followed by brain, pituitary, and kidney.
Western blot of in vitro-translated EDD detected a protein with an
apparent molecular mass of 300 kD.

In addition to the domains identified by Callaghan et al. (1998) in EDD,
Henderson et al. (2002) identified an N-terminal ubiquitin-associated
(UBA) domain, a central UBR1 (605981)-like zinc finger motif, and a
third putative nuclear localization signal.

GENE FUNCTION

By Northern blot analysis, Callaghan et al. (1998) demonstrated that
expression of EDD was enhanced in breast cancer cells following exposure
to a synthetic progestin. Inhibitors of both transcription and
translation could block the induction of EDD. In vitro, EDD reversibly
bound ubiquitin through a cysteine residue within the conserved
C-terminal HECT domain.

Honda et al. (2002) found that HYD bound to the C-terminal BRCA1
(113705) domains of DNA topoisomerase-binding protein-1 (TOPBP1;
607760). Several ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, UBCH4, UBCH5B (602962),
and UBCH5C (602963), transferred ubiquitin molecules to HYD, leading to
ubiquitination of TOPBP1. Honda et al. (2002) concluded that HYD is a
ubiquitin ligase.

Henderson et al. (2002) showed that EDD interacted with importin alpha-5
(600686) through 2 consensus basic nuclear localization signals in its N
terminus and was localized in cell nuclei. EDD also bound progesterone
receptor (PGR; 607311) and potentiated progestin-mediated gene
transactivation. The interaction with PGR did not require the LxxLL
receptor-binding motif of EDD. EDD also bound calcium- and
integrin-binding protein/DNA-dependent protein kinase-interacting
protein (KIP; 602293), and the interaction between EDD and KIP was
altered in response to DNA damage.

By analyzing several cancers of diverse tissue origin, Clancy et al.
(2003) found that allelic imbalance at the EDD locus was common in
several carcinomas. The EDD gene was also frequently overexpressed in
breast and ovarian cancers.

Okamoto et al. (2013) addressed the molecular properties of TRF2
(602027) that are both necessary and sufficient to protect chromosome
ends in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and stated that their data
supported a 2-step mechanism for TRF2-mediated end protection. First,
the dimerization domain of TRF2 is required to inhibit ATM (607585)
activation, the key initial step involved in the activation of a DNA
damage response (DDR). Next, TRF2 independently suppresses the
propagation of DNA damage signaling downstream of ATM activation. This
novel modulation of the DDR at telomeres occurs at the level of the E3
ubiquitin ligase RNF168 (612688). Inhibition of RNF168 at telomeres
involves the deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC3 (300617) and the ubiquitin
ligase UBR5, and is sufficient to suppress chromosome end-to-end
fusions. Okamoto et al. (2013) concluded that this 2-step mechanism for
TRF2-mediated end protection helped to explain the apparent paradox of
frequent localization of DDR proteins at functional telomeres without
concurrent induction of detrimental DNA repair activities.

MAPPING

By FISH, Callaghan et al. (1998) mapped the EDD1 gene to chromosome
8q22.3.

606738	TITLE *606738 OXYSTEROL-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE PROTEIN 10; OSBPL10
;;OSBP-RELATED PROTEIN 10; ORP10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

OSBPL10 is a member of the OSBP family of intracellular lipid receptors.
For background information on OSBPs, see OSBP2 (606729).

CLONING

Lehto et al. (2001) used database searching and RT-PCR analysis to
identify a full-length cDNA encoding OSBPL10, which they called ORP10.
Sequence analysis predicted that the 764-amino acid protein contains a
C-terminal sterol-binding (SB) domain of approximately 400 residues that
includes the OSBP motif (EQVSHHPP). It has a pleckstrin homology (PH)
domain in its N terminus. OSBPL10 is 75% and 58% identical to OSBPL11
(606739) in the SB and PH domains, respectively. Dot blot analysis
revealed wide expression that was strongest in kidney and placenta,
followed by heart, skeletal muscle, liver, small intestine, spleen,
lung, and testis.

Jaworski et al. (2001) cloned multiple OSBPs, including OSBPL10. RT-PCR
analysis detected weak expression limited to brain, retinal pigment
epithelium choroid, and cultured retinal pigment epithelial cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

By sequence analysis, Lehto et al. (2001) determined that the OSBPL10
gene contains at least 8 exons.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Lehto et al. (2001) mapped the OSBPL10 gene to
chromosome 3. Jaworski et al. (2001) refined the localization to 3p22 or
3p25.3-p24.1.

607268	TITLE *607268 CHROMATIN ACCESSIBILITY COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 1; CHRAC1
;;CHROMATIN ACCESSIBILITY COMPLEX, 15-KD SUBUNIT; CHRAC15;;
NFYC-LIKE PROTEIN 1; YCL1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CHRAC1 is a histone-fold protein that interacts with other histone-fold
proteins to bind DNA in a sequence-independent manner. These
histone-fold protein dimers combine within larger enzymatic complexes
for DNA transcription, replication, and packaging.

CLONING

Poot et al. (2000) identified CHRAC1, which they designated CHRAC15, or
p15, within a chromatin remodeling complex, CHRAC, purified from HeLa
cell nuclear extracts. The protein contains 131 amino acids and shows an
apparent molecular mass of 15 kD by SDS-PAGE. The putative histone-fold
domain of CHRAC1 has similarity to the H2A-type histone-fold domain of
CBFC (NFYC; 605344). Northern blot analysis revealed variable but
ubiquitous expression of a 2.4-kb transcript that paralleled the
expression of another histone-fold protein, CHRAC17 (POLE3; 607267).

Bolognese et al. (2000) cloned mouse Chrac1, which they designated Ycl1.
The deduced 129-amino acid protein is highly acidic and contains a short
N terminus, a central 65-amino acid histone-fold motif, and a short C
terminus that is rich in lysine and acidic residues. The authors noted
that there is a high degree of phylogenetic conservation that extends
beyond the histone-fold motif. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of a 1.2-kb transcript in all mouse cell lines tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Poot et al. (2000) affinity purified a human chromatin remodeling
complex, CHRAC, from HeLa cell nuclear extracts using antibody that
cross-reacts with the SNF2H (SMARCA5; 603375) and SNF2L (see 300012)
isoforms of human ISWI but does not distinguish between them. POLE3,
CHRAC1, and BAZ1A (605680), which the authors called ACF1,
coimmunoprecipitated within this ISWI-containing complex, and the
authors determined that the complex contains predominantly the SNF2H
isoform of ISWI. Using pull-down assays with recombinant proteins, Poot
et al. (2000) found that POLE3 and CHRAC1 interact directly with each
other, and they concluded that the H2B-type histone-fold domain of POLE3
likely interacts with the H2A-type histone-fold domain of CHRAC1. They
confirmed high-affinity DNA-binding activity for the POLE3-CHRAC1
complex, with a dissociation constant in the submicromolar range. POLE3
and CHRAC1 did not interact individually with DNA, and the POLE3-CHRAC1
complex did not interact well with nucleosomes.

Using an in vitro protein-protein interaction assay between recombinant
mouse proteins and nuclear extracts, Bolognese et al. (2000) confirmed
heterodimerization between Pole3 and Chrac1. In nucleosome
reconstitution assays, the Pole3-Chrac1 dimer formed complexes with
histones in solution and on DNA.

MAPPING

Based on sequence similarity to an EST (GenBank GENBANK AI931369),
Bolognese et al. (2000) mapped the CHRAC1 gene to chromosome 8q11-q12.

300617	TITLE *300617 BRCA1/BRCA2-CONTAINING COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 3; BRCC3
;;C6.1A;;
BRCC36
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kenwrick et al., 1992 identified cDNA clones corresponding to the BRCC3
and MTCP1 (300116) genes, which they called C6.1A and C6.1B,
respectively. The C6.1A gene was highly conserved between species and
expressed abundantly in many human and mouse tissues.

Dong et al. (2003) determined that the BRCC3 gene encodes a 316-amino
acid protein with a molecular mass of 36 kD. BRCC3 shares sequence
homology with the JAMM domain of POH1 (PSMD14; 607173) and COPS5
(604850).

GENE FUNCTION

Dong et al. (2003) demonstrated that in human cell lines BRCC3 and BRE
(610497) are components of a holoenzyme complex containing BRCA1
(113705), BRCA2 (600185), BARD1 (601593), and RAD51 (179617), which they
called the BRCA1- and BRCA2-containing complex (BRCC). The complex
showed UBC5 (see UBE2D1; 602961)-dependent ubiquitin E3 ligase activity.
Inclusion of BRE and BRCC3 enhanced ubiquitination by the complex, and
cancer-associated truncations in BRCA1 reduced the association of BRE
and BRCC3 with the complex. RNA interference of BRE and BRCC3 in HeLa
cells increased cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation and resulted in a
defect in G2/M checkpoint arrest. Dong et al. (2003) concluded that BRCC
is a ubiquitin E3 ligase that enhances cellular survival following DNA
damage.

Okamoto et al. (2013) addressed the molecular properties of TRF2
(602027) that are both necessary and sufficient to protect chromosome
ends in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and stated that their data
supported a 2-step mechanism for TRF2-mediated end protection. First,
the dimerization domain of TRF2 is required to inhibit ATM (607585)
activation, the key initial step involved in the activation of a DNA
damage response (DDR). Next, TRF2 independently suppresses the
propagation of DNA damage signaling downstream of ATM activation. This
novel modulation of the DDR at telomeres occurs at the level of the E3
ubiquitin ligase RNF168 (612688). Inhibition of RNF168 at telomeres
involves the deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC3 and the ubiquitin ligase UBR5
(608413), and is sufficient to suppress chromosome end-to-end fusions.
Okamoto et al. (2013) concluded that this 2-step mechanism for
TRF2-mediated end protection helped to explain the apparent paradox of
frequent localization of DDR proteins at functional telomeres without
concurrent induction of detrimental DNA repair activities.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Kenwrick et al. (1992) mapped the BRCC3
gene to chromosome Xq28.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 3 unrelated families with an X-linked recessive
syndromic form of moyamoya disease (MYMY4; 300845), Miskinyte et al.
(2011) identified 3 different deletions on chromosome Xq28. The critical
region of overlap was a 3.4-kb region including exon 1 of the
MTCP1/MTCP1NB gene (300116) and the first 3 exons of the BRCC3 gene,
resulting in loss of BRCC3 and MTCP1NB expression in patient
lymphoblastoid cell lines. Morpholino knockdown of Brcc3 in zebrafish
resulted in defective angiogenesis that could be rescued by endothelial
expression of Brcc3, suggesting that loss of BRCC3 function was
responsible for the human disorder. The phenotype is a multisystem
disorder characterized by moyamoya disease, short stature,
hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and facial dysmorphism. Other variable
features include dilated cardiomyopathy and premature graying of the
hair. Miskinyte et al. (2011) noted that some of the features of the
disorder were reminiscent of chromosome breakage syndromes.

612679	TITLE *612679 CUGBP- AND ELAV-LIKE FAMILY, MEMBER 4; CELF4
;;CUGBP- AND ETR3-LIKE FACTOR 4;;
BRUNO-LIKE 4; BRUNOL4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the CELF family, such as CELF4, play various roles in
cotranscriptional and posttranscriptional RNA processing. All CELF
proteins appear to affect pre-mRNA splicing, but individual CELFs have
divergent roles in regulating mRNA stability and translation (summary by
Wagnon et al., 2012).

CLONING

By searching databases for human sequences similar to Xenopus Brunol1
(TNRC4; 612678), followed by genomic sequence analysis, Good et al.
(2000) identified BRUNOL4. The deduced protein contains 2 N-terminal
RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs), a long linker region, and a C-terminal
RRM. Good et al. (2000) also identified BRUNOL4 splice variants that
encode proteins lacking 20 or 48 amino acids of the third RRM.

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to CUGBP (601074),
followed by PCR of a human brain cDNA library, Ladd et al. (2001) cloned
BRUNOL4, which they called CELF4. In addition to the 3 RRMs, the deduced
486-amino acid CELF4 protein contains multiple potential phosphorylation
sites and a consensus nuclear localization signal near the C terminus.
Western blot analysis of adult mouse tissues detected multiple CELF4
isoforms that were expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle and brain.

Using RNA dot blot analysis, Ladd et al. (2004) found that CELF4 was
expressed in all adult and fetal human tissues examined, with highest
expression throughout brain and in glandular tissues. Expression was
moderate in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver, and low in all other
tissues examined.

Using Northern blot analysis, Yang et al. (2007) found high Brunol4
expression in adult mouse brain. In situ hybridization revealed
strongest Brunol4 expression in hippocampus, with lower expression in
cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, and granule cell layer of cerebellum.
Within hippocampus, highest expression was detected in pyramidal neurons
of the CA2 and CA3 region.

Wagnon et al. (2012) found that Celf4 was enriched in the polysome
fraction, but not synaptosome fractions, of cortical mouse brain
lysates. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed Celf4 in cell bodies and
proximal processes, but not synapses, in several mouse brain regions.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Good et al. (2000) mapped the BRUNOL4 gene
to chromosome 18q12.

Yang et al. (2007) mapped the Celf4 gene to mouse chromosome 8.

GENE FUNCTION

Ladd et al. (2001) showed that all human CELF proteins, including CELF4,
bound RNA containing muscle-specific splicing enhancer (MSE) elements
and could activate MSE-dependent exon inclusion of cardiac troponin T
(TNNT2; 191045) minigenes in transfected quail fibroblasts.

By analyzing mRNAs with which Celf4 crosslinked, Wagnon et al. (2012)
determined that Celf4 interacted with at least 15% of the transcriptome
in wildtype mouse brain. Celf4 showed specificity for the 3-prime UTRs
of target transcripts and predominantly bound an (A/U)UGU motif.
Comparison of transcripts bound by wildtype and Celf4-deficient mouse
brain revealed that Celf4 controlled a wide variety of transcripts, with
prominent effects on membrane-associated synaptic proteins and
regulators of synaptic plasticity, including transporters and ion
channels, and cell adhesion molecules. Celf4 did not alter splicing
patterns, but appeared to regulate mRNA expression, translation, and
localization.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yang et al. (2007) described a mouse mutation in transgenic mice, called
frequent flyer (Ff), that showed genotype-, age-, and strain- dependent
severity of neurologic features beginning at 3 months of age. Defects
included recurrent limbic and tonic-clonic seizures upon routine
handling, spike-wave discharges, and rearing and falling followed by a
running and bouncing phase for which the mutation was named. On a
C57BL/6L background, homozygous (Ff/Ff) mutant mice died perinatally.
Ff/+ heterozygotes also showed hyperactivity and developed late-onset
obesity, but they had a normal life span. Neither Ff/Ff nor Ff/+ mutants
showed abnormal brain morphology. Yang et al. (2007) identified the Ff
mutation as an insertion of the transgene into intron 1 of the Brunol4
gene, where it was predicted to interfere with Brunol4 splicing. RT-PCR
detected no Brunol4 transcripts in Ff/Ff brain and a 45% reduction of
Brunol4 in Ff/+ brain. Microarray analysis of Ff/Ff newborns revealed
downregulation of 94 transcripts, including Brunol4 itself and 4 genes
known or predicted to be involved in neuroexcitability: Htr2c (312861),
Syn2 (600755), Nsf (601633), and Snca (163890).

Wagnon et al. (2011) found that knockout of Celf4 in mice resulted in a
genetically complex seizure disorder similar to that see in Ff mice.
Spatial and temporal conditional knockout of Celf4 alleles showed that
deletion of Celf4 within the first postnatal week resulted in
absence-like nonconvulsive seizures, whereas Celf4 deletion in adult
mice resulted in convulsive seizures. Selective deletion of Celf4 from
cerebral cortex and hippocampal excitatory neurons lowered seizure
threshold and promoted spontaneous convulsions. Deletion of Celf4 from
inhibitory neurons appeared to increase seizure threshold.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed Celf4 expression predominantly in
excitatory neurons of cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and
reticular thalamus. Patch-clamp recordings of cortical layer V pyramidal
neurons revealed that Celf4 deletion increased response frequency and
amplitude, suggesting that Celf4-deficient mice have altered excitatory,
but not inhibitory, neurotransmission.

600940	TITLE *600940 LIGASE III, DNA, ATP-DEPENDENT; LIG3
;;DNA LIGASE III
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chen et al. (1995) purified DNA ligase II and DNA ligase III to near
homogeneity from bovine liver and testis, respectively. Amino acid
sequencing studies indicated that these enzymes are encoded by the same
gene. Chen et al. (1995) isolated human and murine cDNA clones encoding
DNA ligase III (LIG3) with probes based on the peptide sequences. The
LIG3 cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 862 amino acids, whose sequence is
more closely related to those of the DNA ligases encoded by poxviruses
than to replicative DNA ligases, such as human DNA ligase I (126391).

GENE FUNCTION

Chen et al. (1995) observed elevated levels of DNA ligase III mRNA in
primary spermatocytes undergoing recombination prior to the first
meiotic division. Therefore, they suggested that DNA ligase III seals
DNA strand breaks that arise during the process of meiotic recombination
in germ cells and as a consequence of DNA damage in somatic cells.

Using primary human fibroblasts, Moser et al. (2007) showed that XRCC1
(194360) and LIG3 were essential core components of nucleotide excision
repair (NER). Downregulation of LIG3 impaired removal of ultraviolet
(UV)-induced lesions and rejoining of UV-induced nicks in chromosomal
DNA. Moreover, XRCC1-LIG3 and polymerase-delta (see POLD1; 174761)
interacted and colocalized with NER components in a UV-specific manner
throughout interphase. In contrast, recruitment of LIG1 (126391) and
polymerase-epsilon (POLE; 174762) to UV-irradiated sites was only
observed in proliferating cells. Moser et al. (2007) concluded that DNA
ligases and polymerases are differentially recruited for NER-mediated
DNA repair during the cell cycle.

Gao et al. (2011) reported that DNA ligase III is essential for
mitochondrial DNA integrity but dispensable for nuclear DNA repair.
Inactivation of ligase III in the mouse nervous system resulted in mtDNA
loss leading to profound mitochondrial dysfunction, disruption of
cellular homeostasis, and incapacitating ataxia. Similarly, inactivation
of ligase III in cardiac muscle resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction
and defective heart-pump function leading to heart failure. However,
ligase III inactivation did not result in nuclear DNA repair deficiency,
indicating that essential DNA repair repair functions of Xrcc1 (194360)
can occur in the absence of ligase III. Instead, Gao et al. (2011) found
that ligase I was critical for DNA repair, but acted in a cooperative
manner with ligase III. Additionally, ligase III deficiency did not
recapitulate the hallmark features of neural Xrcc1 inactivation such as
DNA damage-induced cerebellar interneuron loss, further underscoring
functional separation of these DNA repair factors. Therefore, Gao et al.
(2011) concluded that the biological role of ligase III is to maintain
mtDNA integrity and not Xrcc1-dependent DNA repair.

Simsek et al. (2011) demonstrated a crucial role for DNA ligase III in
mitochondria but not in XRCC1-dependent repair. Simsek et al. (2011)
used preemptive complementation to determine the viability requirement
for Lig3 in mammalian cells and its requirement in DNA repair. Various
forms of Lig3 were introduced stably into mouse embryonic stem cells
containing a conditional allele of Lig3 that could be deleted with Cre
recombinase. With this approach, Gao et al. (2011) found that the
mitochondrial, but not nuclear, Lig3 is required for cellular viability.
Although the catalytic function of Lig3 is required, the zinc finger and
BRAC1 C-terminal-related domains of Lig3 are not. Remarkably, the
viability requirement for Lig3 can be circumvented by targeting Lig1 to
the mitochondria or expressing Chlorella virus DNA ligase, the minimal
eukaryal nick-sealing enzyme, or Escherichia coli LigA, an
NAD(+)-dependent ligase. Lig3-null cells are not sensitive to several
DNA-damaging agents that sensitize Xrcc1-deficient cells. Simsek et al.
(2011) concluded that their results established a role for Lig3 in
mitochondria, but distinguished it from its interacting protein XRCC1.

MAPPING

Chen et al. (1995) mapped the LIG3 gene to human chromosome 17 by PCR
analysis of a human-rodent somatic cell hybrid mapping panel. Wei et al.
(1995) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the human DNA
ligase III gene to human chromosome 17q11.2-q12.

610900	TITLE *610900 CHMP FAMILY, MEMBER 5; CHMP5
;;CHROMATIN-MODIFYING PROTEIN 5;;
CHARGED MULTIVESICULAR BODY PROTEIN 5;;
HSPC177
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CHMP5 belongs to the chromatin-modifying protein/charged multivesicular
body protein (CHMP) family. These proteins are components of ESCRT-III
(endosomal sorting complex required for transport III), a complex
involved in degradation of surface receptor proteins and formation of
endocytic multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Some CHMPs have both nuclear and
cytoplasmic/vesicular distributions, and one such CHMP, CHMP1A (164010),
is required for both MVB formation and regulation of cell cycle
progression (Tsang et al., 2006).

CLONING

Ward et al. (2005) stated that CHMP5 is a small coiled-coil protein.
Cell fractionation of COS-7 cells followed by Western blot analysis
showed that endogenous Chmp5 was primarily a cytosolic protein.
Fluorescence-tagged human CHMP5 localized to vesicles near the nucleus
in transfected COS-7 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using affinity purification experiments, Ward et al. (2005) showed that
LIP5 (610902) specifically interacted with CHMP5. Depletion of CHMP5 by
small-interfering RNA did not alter the distribution of early or late
endocytic markers in HeLa and 293T cells, but it altered EGFR (131550)
trafficking and reduced EGFR degradation in lysosomes. Depletion of
CHMP5 in 293T cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1
increased release of infectious particles.

Tsang et al. (2006) performed a systematic yeast 2-hybrid analysis of
human ESCRT-III components, including CHMP5. CHMP5 interacted with
SMARCA4 (603254), which may be involved in chromatin remodeling. In
addition, CHMP5 interacted with the SUMO (see SUMO1; 601912)-conjugating
enzyme UBE2I (601661) and appeared to be part of a network connecting
CHMP1A, CHMP4B (610897), and CHMP5 with UBE2I, SUMO1, PIAS2 (603567),
and HIPK2 (606868), all of which are involved in nuclear sumoylation
processes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the CHMP5 gene to chromosome 9p13.3 based on an
alignment of the CHMP5 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF132968) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

;;MAMMALIAN STERILE 20-LIKE 1; MST1;;
KINASE RESPONSIVE TO STRESS 2; KRS2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Protein kinase activation is a frequent response of cells to treatment
with growth factors, chemicals, heat shock, or apoptosis-inducing
agents. This protein kinase activation presumably allows cells to resist
unfavorable environmental conditions. The yeast 'sterile 20' (Ste20)
kinase acts upstream of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
cascade that is activated under a variety of stress conditions. By
screening a lymphocyte cDNA library using degenerate PCR primers
corresponding to the catalytic domains of serine/threonine kinases
(STKs) and using an Ste20-like probe, Creasy and Chernoff (1995)
obtained a cDNA encoding STK4, which they called MST1. Sequence analysis
indicated that the N terminus of the deduced 487-amino acid STK4 protein
contains the 11 subdomains typical of an STK. The C terminus of STK4 is
highly acidic. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of
an approximately 7.0-kb STK4 transcript; abundant expression of a 3.4-kb
potential splice variant in kidney, placenta, and skeletal muscle was
also detected. Western blot analysis detected expression of a 56-kD STK4
protein in all cell lines examined.

Taylor et al. (1996) purified 61- and 63-kD protein kinases, referred to
as p61 and p63, that were activated by a subset of stress conditions but
not by common mitogenic stimuli. By screening a Jurkat cell cDNA library
using PCR primers corresponding to a peptide sequence derived from p61
and a predicted sequence from a previously reported partial cDNA, they
isolated cDNAs encoding STK3 (p63; 605030) and STK4 (p61), which they
designated KRS1 and KRS2, respectively. STK3 and STK4 share 94% amino
acid identity in the catalytic domain and 78% identity overall.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the STK4 gene to chromosome 20q13.12 based on an
alignment of the STK4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC005231) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analyses by Creasy and Chernoff (1995) showed that STK4 can
phosphorylate itself or myelin basic protein (MBP; 159430) on serine and
threonine residues. Overexpression of STK4 did not activate the ERK1
(MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948) MAPK pathway, and STK4 activity
decreased with epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530) treatment but
increased with protein phosphatase-2A (see PPP2CA; 176915) treatment.

DNA in eukaryotic cells is associated with histone proteins; hence,
hallmark properties of apoptosis, such as chromatin condensation, may be
regulated by posttranslational histone modifications. Cheung et al.
(2003) reported that phosphorylation of histone H2B (see 609904) at
ser14 correlates with cells undergoing programmed cell death in
vertebrates. They identified a 34-kD apoptosis-induced H2B kinase as
caspase-cleaved MST1. MST1 could phosphorylate H2B at ser14 in vitro and
in vivo, and the onset of H2B ser14 phosphorylation was dependent upon
cleavage of MST1 by caspase-3 (600636). These data revealed a histone
modification uniquely associated with apoptotic chromatin in species
ranging from frogs to humans and provided insights into a physiologic
substrate for MST1. These data also provided evidence for a potential
apoptotic 'histone code.'

Using human and other mammalian cells, Lehtinen et al. (2006) found that
MST1 phosphorylated FOXO transcription factors at a site conserved
within the forkhead domain of FOXO proteins from mammals to C. elegans.
Oxidative stress induced MST1-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO3 (FOXO3A;
602681) at ser207, which disrupted interaction of FOXO3 with 14-3-3
proteins (see 113508), promoted FOXO3 nuclear translocation, and induced
cell death. Knockdown of the C. elegans MST1 ortholog Cst1 shortened
life span and accelerated tissue aging, whereas Cst1 overexpression
promoted life span and delayed tissue aging. The Cst1-induced life span
extension was dependent on the FOXO ortholog Daf16.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 consanguineous unrelated Turkish families with 4 patients affected
by combined immunodeficiencies with multiple bacterial and viral
infections, autoimmunity, and progressive CD4 and naive CD8 T-cell
lymphopenia (614868), Nehme et al. (2012) identified putative truncation
mutations in the STK4 gene. The patient in the first family was
homozygous for an arg117-to-ter substitution (604965.0001). The 3
affected sibs in the second family were homozygous for a 1-bp deletion
that resulted in a frameshift at residue 368 and a contiguous nonsense
codon at residue 369 (604965.0002). Parents and healthy sibs in both
families were heterozygous for the mutations, indicating autosomal
recessive inheritance. RT-PCR analysis showed loss of function and
expression of STK4 in patients. Lymphoproliferative responses and
lymphocyte survival were also impaired. FOXO1 (136533), IL7R (146661),
and BCL2 (151430) were poorly expressed in patient T cells, whereas FAS
(TNFRFS6; 134637) expression was upregulated. Nehme et al. (2012)
concluded that the STK4/FOXO1 pathway has a role in controlling the
death of naive T cells.

In 3 members of a consanguineous Iranian kindred with T- and
B-lymphopenia, neutropenia, cardiac malformations, and recurrent
bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, warts, and abscesses,
Abdollahpour et al. (2012) identified a homozygous premature termination
mutation in the STK4 gene (W250X; 604965.0003). Parents and healthy sibs
were heterozygous, indicating autosomal recessive inheritance. Western
blot analysis showed that patients with homozygous mutations expressed
no STK4, whereas heterozygous carriers expressed intermediate levels
compared to wildtype homozygous subjects. STK4-deficient lymphocytes and
neutrophils exhibited enhanced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential
and increased susceptibility to apoptosis.

In a Turkish patient with T-cell immunodeficiency leading to multiple
bacterial and viral infections (614868), Nehme et al. (2012) identified
a homozygous 349C-T transition in exon 4 of the STK4 gene, resulting in
an arg117-to-ter (R117X) substitution. The boy's parents, who were
consanguineous, were heterozygous for the mutation. At age 5 years, the
boy was successfully treated for Epstein-Barr virus-positive Hodgkin
B-cell lymphoma and was alive at age 17 years with the support of
immunoglobulin replacement therapy and antiinfective prophylaxis.

In 3 Turkish sisters with T-cell immunodeficiency leading to multiple
bacterial and viral infections (614868), Nehme et al. (2012) identified
a homozygous 1-bp deletion (1103T) in the STK4 gene that created a
frameshift mutation at codon 368 followed by a contiguous nonsense codon
(369X) downstream of the CASP3 (600636) cleavage site. The girls'
parents, who were consanguineous, were heterozygous for the mutation.
The eldest daughter developed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) B-cell
lymphoproliferative syndrome at age 9 years and died from
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and infectious complications after
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The second daughter
developed autoimmune hemolytic anemia with persistent EBV viremia and
died of GVHD and infectious complications after HSCT at age 14.5 years.
The third daughter received a T-cell depleted HSCT at age 4 years and
appeared to be cured 2 years later.

substitution, in 3 members of a consanguineous Iranian family with
T-cell immunodeficiency leading to multiple bacterial and viral
infections (614868). Two of the patients were sibs, and 2 of their sibs
had died in infancy due to septicemia. The other patient was their
niece. The parents of the patients were heterozygous for the mutation.
The patients, aged 24, 20, and 9 years, had all experienced recurrent
respiratory tract bacterial and viral infections and pneumonias,
neutropenia, and lymphopenia with low numbers of CD4 (186940) T cells
and B cells and elevated CD8 (see 186910) T cells. The patients had
cutaneous warts caused by various human papillomavirus types, as well
recurrent oral herpes, and all 3 exhibited cardiac malformations.

;;PRP8;;
PRPC8;;
U5 snRNP-SPECIFIC PROTEIN, 220-KD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PRPF8 is a component of mammalian spliceosomes, large multiprotein
complexes involved in the removal of introns from mRNA precursors
(summary by Luo et al., 1999).

CLONING

By searching EST databases using yeast and nematode Prp8, screening a
HeLa cell cDNA library, and 5-prime RACE of a placenta cDNA library, Luo
et al. (1999) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding PRP8. The deduced
2,335-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 274 kD.
Overall, PRP8 shares 86% identity with the nematode protein and 62%
identity with S. cerevisiae Prp8. A central 290-amino acid stretch shows
the highest identity, and the least conserved regions are located at the
N and C termini. Northern blot analysis revealed highest expression of a
7.8-kb transcript in skeletal muscle and heart, with lower expression in
pancreas, kidney, lung, placenta, and brain, and almost undetectable
expression in liver.

GENE FUNCTION

By sedimentation analysis, radioimmunoprecipitations, and Far Western
(overlay) analysis, Achsel et al. (1998) determined that the 220-kD
PRPF8 protein has a central structural role in the architecture of the
U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) particle. The 220-kD protein
is directly bound by the 40-kD component (SPF38; 607797) and by the
116-kD component (603892).

Luo et al. (1999) determined that antibodies to PRPF8 immunoprecipitated
the major U2 (180690)-dependent spliceosome. The precipitate included
pre-mRNA in addition to splicing intermediates and products, suggesting
that PRPF8 joined the spliceosome prior to the first chemical step and
remained associated with the complex through both splicing reactions.
Antibodies also immunoprecipitated the minor U12-dependent spliceosome,
with coimmunoprecipitation of pre-mRNA, lariat intermediate, lariat
product, and ligated exons.

GENE STRUCTURE

Luo et al. (1999) determined that the PRPF8 gene contains 43 exons. The
first exon is untranslated.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Luo et al. (1999) mapped the PRPF8 gene to
chromosome 17p13.3. By Southern blot analysis, they determined that
PRPF8 is represented by a single gene.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Mozaffari-Jovin et al. (2013) showed by crystal structure and
biochemical analyses that the Prp8 protein, a major regulator of the
spliceosome, can insert its C-terminal tail into the RNA-binding tunnel
of Brr2 (601664), thereby intermittently blocking Brr2's RNA-binding,
adenosine triphosphatase, and U4/U6-unwinding activities. Inefficient
Brr2 repression is the only recognizable phenotype associated with
certain retinitis pigmentosa-linked Prp8 mutations that map to its
C-terminal tail. Mozaffari-Jovin et al. (2013) concluded that their data
showed how a Ski2-like RNA helicase can be reversibly inhibited by a
protein cofactor that directly competes with RNA substrate binding.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By linkage mapping, the RP13 locus (600059) for autosomal dominant
retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) was mapped to chromosome 17p13.3 in a large
South African adRP family of British descent (Greenberg et al., 1994).
Using a positional cloning and candidate gene strategy, McKie et al.
(2001) identified 7 different missense mutations in the PRPF8 splicing
factor gene in adRP families (see, e.g., 607300.0001-607300.0005). Three
of the mutations cosegregated within 3 RP13-linked families including
the original large South African pedigree, and 4 additional mutations
had been identified in other unrelated adRP families. The 7 mutations
are clustered within a 14-codon stretch within the last exon of this
large 7-kb transcript. The altered amino acid residues at the C terminus
exhibited a high degree of conservation across species as diverse as
humans, Arabidopsis, and trypanosome, suggesting that some functional
significance may be associated with this part of the protein.

Towns et al. (2010) identified 3 mutations in PRPF8, including the first
documented mutation outside exon 42 (607300.0006) and the first de novo
mutation (607300.0002). They compared clinical data for 75 RP13
patients, which revealed that whereas the effect on peripheral retinal
function is severe, patients generally retain good visual acuity in at
least one eye until the fifth or sixth decade. They noted that the
H2309P (607300.0002) and H2309R (607300.0001) mutations seemed to be
associated with a worse prognosis than the R2310K mutation
(607300.0003), an observation that correlated with results of studies in
yeast.

Maubaret et al. (2011) presented detailed genotype/phenotype correlation
in 2 British RP13 families, including the one with an exon 38 mutation
reported by Towns et al. (2010).

By quantitating RNA content in Northern blots, Tanackovic et al. (2011)
determined that normal human retina expressed about 7 times more major
snRNAs than other tissues tested. Retina also expressed about twice as
many minor snRNAs than other tissues, except for testis, which had
comparable minor snRNA content. Retina also showed higher content of
processed pre-mRNAs. Compared with normal human lymphocytes, patient
lymphocyte cell lines with mutations in the PRPF31 (606419), PRPF3
(607301), and PRPF8 genes showed mutation- and gene-specific changes in
the stoichiometry of snRNAs and altered composition of the precatalytic
U4/U6.U5 complex. Mutations in the PRPF genes caused delayed spliceosome
assembly, with transcript-specific splicing defects and altered patterns
of alternative splicing. Tanackovic et al. (2011) concluded that
retinitis pigmentosa is a systemic splicing disease, but that retina is
more sensitive to the defect due to elevated splicing activity in retina
compared with other tissues.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 13
PRPF8, HIS2309ARG

In a large South African family with retinitis pigmentosa-13 (600059),
McKie et al. (2001) found affected individuals heterozygous for an
A-to-G transition at position 6967 in exon 42 of the PRPF8 gene, which
resulted in a his2309-to-arg (H2309R) substitution. Histidine-2309 is
one of several highly conserved residues in this region of the protein.

.0002
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 13
PRPF8, HIS2309PRO

In a large British family with retinitis pigmentosa-13 (600059), McKie
et al. (2001) found affected individuals heterozygous for an A-to-C
transversion at position 6967 in exon 42 of the PRPF8 gene, which
resulted in a his2309-to-pro (H2309P) substitution. Histidine-2309 is
one of several highly conserved residues in this region of the protein.

Towns et al. (2010) detected this mutation de novo in a 9-year-old
Caucasian boy. They commented that this observation could imply that
this codon, and potentially this region of the gene, may represent a
mutational hotspot. This was said to be the first report of a de novo
mutation in PRPF8 resulting in retinitis pigmentosa.

.0003
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 13
PRPF8, ARG2310LYS

In a Dutch family with retinitis pigmentosa-13 (600059), McKie et al.
(2001) found affected individuals heterozygous for a G-to-A transition
at position 6970 in exon 42 of the PRPF8 gene, which resulted in an
arg2310-to-lys (R2310K) substitution. Arginine-2310 is one of several
highly conserved residues in this region of the protein.

.0004
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 13
PRPF8, PRO2301THR

In 2 British families with retinitis pigmentosa-13 (600059), McKie et
al. (2001) found affected individuals heterozygous for a C-to-A
transversion in exon 42 of the PRPF8 gene, which resulted in a
pro2301-to-thr (P2301T) substitution. Proline-2301 is one of several
highly conserved residues in this region of the protein.

.0005
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 13
PRPF8, PHE2304LEU

In 2 British families with retinitis pigmentosa-13 (600059), McKie et
al. (2001) found affected individuals heterozygous for a C-to-G
transversion at position 6953 in exon 42 of the PRPF8 gene, which
resulted in a phe2304-to-leu (F2304L) substitution. Phenylalanine-2304
is one of several highly conserved residues in this region of the
protein.

.0006
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 13
PRPF8, SER2118PHE

Towns et al. (2010) detected a 6353C-T transition in exon 38 of the
PRPF8 gene, resulting in a ser2118-to-phe substitution (S2118F), in the
proband of a British family with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa
(RP13; 600059). This was said to be the first report of a PRPF8 mutation
occurring outside exon 42.

Maubaret et al. (2011) presented a detailed genotype/phenotype
correlation of this 6-generation family, which demonstrated marked
variation in the clinical phenotype.

.0007
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 13
PRPF8, ARG2310SER

In the proband of a 3-generation British family with autosomal dominant
retinitis pigmentosa (RP13; 600059), Maubaret et al. (2011) reported a
6930G-C transversion in exon 42 of the PRPF8 gene, resulting in an
arg2310-to-ser substitution (R2310S).

DESCRIPTION

Thymosin-beta-4 induces the expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase activity in vivo and in vitro, inhibits the migration of
macrophages, and stimulates the secretion of hypothalamic luteinizing
hormone-releasing hormone (Clauss et al., 1991).

CLONING

By differential screening of a cDNA library prepared from leukocytes of
an acute lymphocytic leukemia patient, Gondo et al. (1987) isolated a
cDNA encoding thymosin-beta-4. Using Northern blot analysis, they
studied the expression of the 830-nucleotide thymosin-beta-4 mRNA in
various primary myeloid and lymphoid malignant cell lines and in
hemopoietic cell lines. Gondo et al. (1987) stated that the pattern of
thymosin-beta-4 gene expression suggests that it may be involved in an
early phase of the host defense mechanism.

Clauss et al. (1991) noted that the protein was originally isolated from
a partially purified extract of calf thymus, thymosin fraction 5, which
induced differentiation of T cells and was partially effective in some
immunocompromised animals. Further studies demonstrated that the
molecule is ubiquitous; it had been found in all tissues and cell lines
analyzed. It is found in highest concentrations in spleen, thymus, lung,
and peritoneal macrophages. Clauss et al. (1991) isolated a cDNA clone
for the human interferon-inducible gene 6-26 (Friedman et al., 1984) and
showed that its sequence was identical to that for the human
thymosin-beta-4 gene.

Clauss et al. (1991) stated that rat thymosin-beta-4 is synthesized as a
44-amino acid propeptide which is processed into a 43-amino acid peptide
by removal of the first methionyl residue. The molecule does not have a
signal peptide. Human thymosin-beta-4 has a high degree of homology to
rat thymosin-beta-4; the coding regions differ by only 9 nucleotides,
and these are all silent base changes.

Li et al. (1996) established that in the mouse there is a single Tmsb4
gene and that the lymphoid-specific transcript is generated by extending
the ubiquitous exon 1 with an alternate downstream splice site.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (1996) stated that thymosin-beta-4 is an actin monomer
sequestering protein that may have a critical role in modulating the
dynamics of actin polymerization and depolymerization in nonmuscle
cells. Its regulatory role is consistent with the many examples of
transcriptional regulation of T-beta-4 and of tissue-specific
expression. Lymphocytes have a unique T-beta-4 transcript relative to
the ubiquitous transcript found in many other tissues and cells.

Lahn and Page (1997) determined that the TB4X gene escapes X
inactivation, and suggested that it should be investigated as a
candidate gene for Turner syndrome. See 400010.

Commenting on the use of high-density DNA microarrays in gene expression
profiling, Ridley (2000) pointed out that the results of Clark et al.
(2000) indicated that thymosin beta-4 is required for the metastasis of
melanoma cells.

Bock-Marquette et al. (2004) demonstrated that the G-actin sequestering
peptide thymosin beta-4 promoted myocardial and endothelial cell
migration in the embryonic heart and retained this property in postnatal
cardiomyocytes. Survival of embryonic and postnatal cardiomyocytes in
culture was also enhanced by thymosin beta-4. Thymosin beta-4 formed a
functional complex with PINCH1 (602567) and integrin-linked kinase (ILK;
602366), resulting in activation of the survival kinase AKT, also known
as protein kinase B (164730). After coronary artery ligation in mice,
thymosin beta-4 treatment resulted in upregulation of Ilk and Akt
activity in the heart, enhanced early myocyte survival, and improved
cardiac function. Bock-Marquette et al. (2004) concluded that thymosin
beta-4 promotes cardiomyocyte migration, survival, and repair.

By subtractive hybridization and real-time RT-PCR, Ji et al. (2003)
found that TMSB4X was one of several genes whose expression was
increased in nonsmall cell lung cancers prior to metastasizing. TMSB4X
expression was associated with cancers in a stage- and
histology-specific manner. Ji et al. (2003) suggested that TMSB4X
expression may be a prognostic parameter for patient survival in stage I
nonsmall cell lung cancer.

Smart et al. (2007) identified thymosin beta-4 as essential for all
aspects of coronary vessel development in mice, and demonstrated that
T-beta-4 stimulates significant outgrowth from quiescent adult
epicardial explants, restoring pluripotency and triggering
differentiation of fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial
cells. T-beta-4 knockdown in the heart is accompanied by significant
reduction in the proangiogenic cleavage product
N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (AcSDKP). Although injection of
this cleavage product was unable to rescue T-beta-4 mutant hearts, it
significantly enhanced endothelial cell differentiation from adult
epicardially-derived precursor cells. Smart et al. (2007) concluded that
their study identifies T-beta-4 and AcSDKP as potent stimulators of
coronary vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, and reveals T-beta-4-induced
adult epicardial cells as a viable source of vascular progenitors for
continued renewal of regressed vessels at low basal level or sustained
neovascularization following cardiac injury.

In mice, Smart et al. (2011) demonstrated that the adult heart contains
a resident stem or progenitor cell population, which has the potential
to contribute bona fide terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes after
myocardial infarction. Smart et al. (2011) revealed a novel genetic
label of the activated adult progenitors via reexpression of a key
embryonic epicardial gene, Wilms tumor-1 (WT1; 607102), through priming
by thymosin beta-4, a peptide shown to restore vascular potential to
adult epicardium-derived progenitor cells with injury. Cumulative
evidence indicated an epicardial origin of the progenitor population,
and embryonic reprogramming resulted in the mobilization of this
population and concomitant differentiation to give rise to de novo
cardiomyocytes. Cell transplantation confirmed a progenitor source and
chromosome painting of labeled donor cells revealed transdifferentiation
to a myocyte fate in the absence of cell fusion. Smart et al. (2011)
showed that derived cardiomyocytes are able to structurally and
functionally integrate with resident muscle; as such, stimulation of
this adult progenitor pool represented a significant step towards
resident cell-based therapy in human ischemic heart disease.

MAPPING

By use of a panel of human rodent somatic cell hybrids, Clauss et al.
(1991) showed that the 6-26 cDNA, corresponding to the human
thymosin-beta-4 gene, recognized 7 genes, members of a multigene family,
present on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 9, 11, 20, and X. These genes are
symbolized TMSL1, TMSL2, etc., respectively.

By interspecific backcross mapping, Li et al. (1996) located the mouse
gene, which they symbolized Ptmb4, to the distal region of the mouse X
chromosome, linked to Btk (300300) and Gja6. Thus, the human gene could
be predicted to reside on the X chromosome in the general region of
Xq21.3-q22, where BTK is located. By analysis of somatic cell hybrids,
Lahn and Page (1997) mapped the thymosin-beta-4, or TB4X, gene to the X
chromosome. They noted that a homologous gene, TB4Y (400017), is present
on the Y chromosome.

601530	TITLE *601530 SEQUESTOSOME 1; SQSTM1
;;UBIQUITIN-BINDING PROTEIN P62; P62
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Src homology type 2 (SH2) domain is a highly conserved motif of
about 100 amino acids which mediates protein-protein interactions by
binding to phosphotyrosine. p56-lck (153390), a T-cell-specific src
family tyrosine kinase with an SH2 domain, is involved in T-cell signal
transduction. A 62-kD protein (p62) was identified by Park et al. (1995)
as a ligand of the p56-lck SH2 domain.

Joung et al. (1996) cloned the gene for p62 by purifying the p62 protein
to obtain peptide microsequences, producing a PCR product with
degenerate oligonucleotides, and then using this PCR product to screen a
HeLa cell cDNA library. Sequence analysis of full-length cDNAs by Joung
et al. (1996) revealed that the p62 gene encodes a 440-amino acid
polypeptide with the following conserved domains: (1) a cysteine-rich
domain, predicted to be a metal-binding site involved in protein-protein
or protein-DNA interaction; (2) a region with homology to the cdc42
GTPase binding-site; and (3) a PEST motif which is a degradation signal
found in many short-lived proteins. Northern blot analysis suggested
that p62 is expressed ubiquitously in all tissues examined.

Gong et al. (1999) screened a yeast 2-hybrid library made from rat
hippocampal mRNA against full-length Kv-beta-2 (601142). Two previously
unknown interacting proteins were identified, one of which was identical
to Zip (PKC-zeta (176982)-interacting protein), the rat homolog of p62.
Zip1 and Zip2, which arise from alternative splicing, are identical
except for 27 residues missing from Zip2.

GENE FUNCTION

Park et al. (1995) found that the p56-lck SH2 domain binds to p62 at the
ser59 of p62 only when that serine is phosphorylated. Moreover, Park et
al. (1995) found that p62 is associated with a serine/threonine kinase
activity and also binds to ras GTP-ase-activating protein, a negative
regulator of the ras signaling pathway.

Joung et al. (1996) expressed epitope-tagged p62 in HeLa cells and
showed that the expressed protein bound to the lck SH2 domain and that
this binding was dependent on the N-terminal 50 amino acids of p62 but
not on the tyrosine residue in this region. Thus Joung et al. (1996)
proposed that the mechanism of binding of p62 to the p56-lck SH2 domain
is by a mechanism different from the previously characterized modes of
binding of SH2 domains and their ligands.

Vadlamudi et al. (1996) used the yeast 2-hybrid system to identify
proteins that interact with p62. They isolated 46 clones that tested
positively for specific interaction with p62. Forty-three of the 46
clones were found by sequencing to be members of the ubiquitin family.
Ubiquitination of cellular proteins is a crucial feature in regulation
of signal transduction and cell cycle progression through
ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal degradation of important cellular
proteins. Vadlamudi et al. (1996) studied the interaction of p62 with
ubiquitin by in vitro binding studies which showed that p62 binds
noncovalently to ubiquitin. Vadlamudi et al. (1996) noted that p62
contains no homology with any known ubiquitin-binding protein and thus
represents a new class of ubiquitin-binding protein.

Gong et al. (1999) found that the rat Zip1 and Zip2 isoforms
differentially stimulated phosphorylation of Kv-beta-2 by PKC-zeta. Zip1
and Zip2 interacted to form heteromultimers, allowing for a hybrid
stimulatory activity to PKC-zeta. Gong et al. (1999) found that Zip1 and
Zip2 coexisted in the same cell type and were elevated differentially by
neurotrophic factors. They suggested that these results provide a
mechanism for specificity and regulation of PKC-zeta-targeted
phosphorylation.

By small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Rab factors in a murine
macrophage line, Pilli et al. (2012) showed that inhibition of Rab8b
(613532) caused a decrease in conversion of Mycobacterium bovis BCG
phagosomes to degradative compartments after the induction of autophagy
and autophagic killing of mycobacteria. Knockdown of Rab8b-interacting
partners showed that Tbk1 (604834) was critical for autophagic killing
of BCG by suppressing the maturation of autophagosomes.
Coimmunoprecipitation, proximity ligation in situ analysis, and confocal
microscopy revealed that Tbk1 associated with Rab8b on autophagic
organelles. High-content imaging analysis showed that Tbk1 was required
in bone marrow macrophages for phosphorylation of p62 on ser403, which
was in turn required for autophagic function and clearance of p62 and
associated cargo. Further analysis revealed that Il1b was necessary for
the induction of autophagy in mycobacteria-infected macrophages and that
Tbk1 was required for Il1b-induced autophagic elimination of M.
tuberculosis.

Lee et al. (2012) showed that the atypical (i.e., nontuberculous)
mycobacterium M. abscessus (Mabc) robustly activated the NLRP3 (606416)
inflammasome in human macrophages via dectin-1 (CLEC7A; 606264)/SYK
(600085)-dependent signaling and the cytoplasmic scaffold protein
SQSTM1. Both dectin-1 and TLR2 (603028) were required for Mabc-induced
expression of IL1B (147720), CAMP (600474), and DEFB4 (DEFB4A; 602215).
Dectin-1-dependent SYK signaling, but not MYD88 (602170) signaling, led
to activation of CASP1 (147678) and secretion of IL1B through a
potassium efflux-dependent NLRP3/ASC (PYCARD; 606838) inflammasome.
Mabc-induced SQSTM1 expression was also critically involved in NLRP3
inflammasome activation. Lee et al. (2012) concluded that the NLRP3/ASC
inflammasome is critical for antimicrobial responses and innate immunity
to Mabc infection.

GENE STRUCTURE

The 2,870-nucleotide SQSTM1 transcript is contained within 8 exons
distributed over a 16-kb genomic segment (Laurin et al., 2002).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the p62
gene to chromosome 5q35 (TMAP sts-Z40707).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using 24 French Canadian families and 112 unrelated individuals with
Paget disease of bone (602080), Laurin et al. (2002) confined the PDB3
locus (602080) on 5q35-qter to a region of approximately 300 kb. Within
this interval, 2 disease-related haplotype signatures were observed in
11 families and 18 unrelated patients. This region encoded the SQSTM1
gene, which is a candidate gene for PDB because of its association with
the RANK pathway (see 603499). Screening SQSTM1 for mutations led to the
identification of a recurrent nonconservative change (P392L;
601530.0001) flanking the ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA; position
394-440) of the protein that was not present in 291 control individuals.
The data demonstrated that 2 independent mutational events at the same
position in SQSTM1 cause Paget disease of bone in a high proportion of
French Canadian patients.

Kurihara et al. (2007) found that osteoclast precursors from PDB
patients with the P392L mutation and osteoclast precursors transduced
with p62 protein carrying the P392L mutation were hyperresponsive to
RANKL (TNFSF11; 602642) and TNF (191160) compared with control
osteoclast precursors. Mice transgenic for P392L developed increased
osteoclast numbers and progressive bone loss, but they did not manifest
the increased osteoblast numbers seen in PDB. Kurihara et al. (2007)
concluded that expression of P392L in osteoclasts is necessary to cause
predisposition to PDB, but it is not sufficient for the full PDB
phenotype.

ANIMAL MODEL

Inactivation of constitutive autophagy results in formation of
cytoplasmic protein inclusions and leads to liver injury and
neurodegeneration. Using proteomic, immunoprecipitation, and
immunofluorescence microscopy analyses, Komatsu et al. (2007) found that
p62 interacted with LC3 (MAP1LC3A; 601242) in mouse lysosomes and
autophagosomes. p62 accumulated in autophagy-deficient mouse livers and
neurons lacking Atg5 (604261) or Atg7 (608760). Mice lacking p62 were
fertile and lived more than 1 year, although they developed adult-onset
obesity and diabetes. p62 -/- Atg7 -/- double-knockout mice did not
accumulate ubiquitin protein inclusions in neurons or livers. Komatsu et
al. (2007) concluded that p62 levels are regulated by autophagy and that
the pathology of autophagy deficiency is cell type specific.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PAGET DISEASE OF BONE
SQSTM1, PRO392LEU

In 8 families showing linkage of Paget disease (602080) to the PDB3
locus on 5q, Laurin et al. (2002) used a haplotype signature strategy to
find ancestral haplotypes shared by affected individuals to narrow the
mapping interval. The SQSTM1 gene, which maps to that interval, was
found to have a C-to-T transition at position 1215 in exon 8 in all 5
affected individuals tested. This change caused the substitution of
proline-392 to a leucine (P392L). The P392L mutation was found in 18
(16%) of 112 sporadic cases and in 11 (46%) of 24 families with Paget
disease tested. Haplotype analysis by means of intragenic SNPs showed
that the P392L mutation was associated with 2 distinct haplotypes and
probably originated from 2 independent events. This mutation, occurring
at a hypermutable CpG dinucleotide, may have arisen by deamination of a
methylated cytosine.

.0002
PAGET DISEASE OF BONE
SQSTM1, 1-BP INS, 1224T

Hocking et al. (2002) identified 4 of 62 PDB (602080) families whose
affected members were heterozygous for a T insertion after base 1224 in
the SQSTM1 gene. The mutation was predicted to result in premature
termination at codon 396 in the ubiquitin-binding domain.

.0003
PAGET DISEASE OF BONE
SQSTM1, IVS7, G-A, +1

Hocking et al. (2002) identified an Australian family with PDB (602080)
whose affected members were heterozygous for a G-to-A substitution at
splice donor site IVS7+1 of the SQSTM1 gene. The mutation was predicted
to result in skipping of exon 7, which encodes part of the
ubiquitin-binding domain.

610837	TITLE *610837 BCL2-LIKE 12; BCL2L12
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BCL2L12 belongs to the BCL2 family of apoptosis-regulating proteins (see
BCL2; 151430) (Scorilas et al., 2001).

CLONING

Scorilas et al. (2001) identified a BAC clone encoding a BH2 domain,
which is conserved among BCL2 proteins, and by database analysis,
RT-PCR, and 3-prime and 5-prime RACE, they obtained a full-length cDNA
encoding BCL2L12. The deduced 334-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 36.8 kD. It contains several PxxP motifs, a C-terminal
BH2 domain, and multiple sites for O-glycosylation, phosphorylation, and
N-myristoylation. Scorilas et al. (2001) also cloned a BCL2L12 splice
variant lacking exon 3, which encodes a C-terminally truncated 176-amino
acid protein that lacks several PxxP motifs and the BH2 domain. RT-PCR
detected both variants in all adult and fetal tissues examined. The
full-length transcript showed highest expression in thymus, prostate,
fetal liver, mammary gland, colon, placenta, small intestine, kidney,
and bone marrow. The splice variant showed highest expression in
skeletal muscle, fetal liver, and spinal cord. The full-length
transcript was expressed at higher levels than the splice variant in all
tissues examined except skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

By microarray analysis, Stegh et al. (2007) found that BCL2L12
expression was upregulated in 53 of 55 human primary glioblastomas
relative to surrounding normal brain tissue. Immunohistochemical
analysis detected BCL2L12 in tumor cell cytoplasm and in endothelial
cells within abnormal tumor vasculature. A modest amount was detected in
normal neurons, but no staining was detected in normal glia. Expression
of human BCL2L12 conferred marked resistance to apoptosis in mouse
primary cortical astrocytes. Conversely, knockdown of BCL2L12 via RNA
interference sensitized human glioma cell lines to apoptotic stimuli and
impaired tumor growth in mouse xenografts via increased intratumoral
apoptosis. BCL2L12 expression did not affect cytochrome c (123970)
release or protect the mitochondrial membrane, but instead inhibited
postmitochondrial apoptotic signaling at the level of effector caspase
activation. BCL2L12 interacted directly with and neutralized caspase-7
(CASP7; 601761), and it neutralized caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636) by an
indirect mechanism. While BCL2L12 overexpression inhibited apoptosis, it
also induced a necrotic state following activation of apoptotic
signaling.

GENE STRUCTURE

Scorilas et al. (2001) determined that the SLC2L12 gene contains 7
coding exons and spans 8.8 kb. The promoter region contains a TATA box.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Scorilas et al. (2001) mapped the BCL2L12
gene to chromosome 19q13.3, between the RRAS gene (165090) and the PRMT1
gene (602950).

607021	TITLE *607021 SEIZURE-RELATED 6-LIKE; SEZ6L
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Allelic losses on 22q are frequently found in small cell lung carcinomas
(SCLCs) and advanced non-small cell lung carcinomas, indicating the
presence of tumor suppressor gene(s) on that chromosome arm. In an SCLC
cell line, Nishioka et al. (2000) detected a homozygous deletion at
22q12.1. Cloning of the breakpoints revealed that the deletion was
interstitial and was 428,131 bp in size. The deleted region contained
the SEZ6L (seizure 6-like) gene, whose structure had been partially
determined by the chromosome 22 sequencing project (Dunham et al.,
1999). The SEZ6L cDNA contains a 3,072-bp open reading frame encoding a
1,024-amino acid transmembrane protein with multiple domains involved in
protein-protein interaction and signal transduction. SEZ6L expression
was detected in a variety of human tissues, including lung, while its
expression was detected in 14 (30%) of 46 lung cancer cell lines
examined. Missense mutations were detected in 3 (7%) of 46 cell lines,
and a 1-bp deletion in the polypyrimidine tract preceding exon 4 was
detected in 1 (2%) of 46 primary lung cancers. Therefore, Nishioka et
al. (2000) considered it possible that genetic and/or epigenetic SEZ6L
alterations are involved in the development and/or progression in a
subset of lung cancer, although functional analysis of the SEZ6L gene as
well as molecular analysis of other genes in the homozygously deleted
region would be necessary in order to understand the pathogenetic
significance of 22q deletions in human lung carcinogenesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nishioka et al. (2000) concluded that the SEZ6L gene consists of 17
exons within a 210-kb region.

MAPPING

Nishioka et al. (2000) identified the SEZ6L gene within a deletion at
chromosome 22q12.1.

GENE FUNCTION

SEZ6L was one of the genes studied by Suzuki et al. (2002) in a
microarray genome screen for genes upregulated by demethylation and
histone deacetylase inhibition in human colorectal cancer.

605276	TITLE *605276 APOPTOSIS-ASSOCIATED TYROSINE KINASE; AATK
;;AATYK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomly selecting cDNA clones from size-fractionated human brain
cDNA libraries, Ishikawa et al. (1998) identified a full-length cDNA
clone, which they called KIAA0641, encoding a protein with significant
homology to the mouse Aatyk protein identified by Gaozza et al. (1997).
The deduced human AATK protein contains 1,207 amino acids and has an
observed molecular mass greater than 100 kD. By RT-PCR, Ishikawa et al.
(1998) detected expression of AATK in brain, lung, kidney, and pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

From studies of the mouse Aatyk gene, Gaozza et al. (1997) hypothesized
that Aatyk is a necessary prerequisite for the induction of growth
arrest and/or apoptosis of myeloid precursor cells. They found that
expression of Aatyk is dramatically upregulated during apoptotic death
of 32D bone marrow-derived cells during IL3 (147740) deprivation as well
as during GCSF (138970)-induced terminal differentiation of 32D cells.
Additionally, the expression of Aatyk is blocked in v-abl or bcr-abl
transformed myeloid cells, which are unable to apoptose when deprived of
IL3.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the AATK
gene to chromosome 17. By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, Seki et
al. (1999) refined the localization to 17q25.3

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Paris and Williams (2000) identified several genes, including CDHR5,
which they called MUCDHL, by constructing a physical map of chromosome
11p15.5. They found that MUCDHL contains nonpolymorphic tandem repeats
similar to mucin proteins and a consensus calcium-binding motif found in
all cadherins.

111730	TITLE *111730 BETA-1,4-N-ACETYL-GALACTOSAMINYLTRANSFERASE 2; B4GALNT2
;;GALGT2;;
CT-GalNAc TRANSFERASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

B4GALNT2 catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of the human Sd(a)
antigen, which is found on more than 90% of Caucasian red blood cells,
through the addition of an N-acetylgalactosamine residue via a beta-1,4
linkage to a subterminal galactose residue substituted with an
alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid. B4GALNT2 also catalyzes the last step in
the biosynthesis of the Cad antigen, which is related both serologically
and biochemically to the Sd(a) antigen (summary by Montiel et al.,
2003).

CLONING

CT1 and CT2 are monoclonal antibodies that recognize an oligosaccharide
structure that is identical, at least in part, to Sd(a). Using
expression cloning to identify a mouse cDNA that synthesized an epitope
recognized by CT2, Smith and Lowe (1994) cloned B4galnt2, which they
designated CT-GalNAc transferase. The deduced 510-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 58.3 kD. It has characteristics of a type
II transmembrane glycosyltransferase, with a short N-terminal tail,
followed by a transmembrane domain and a 478-amino acid C-terminal
catalytic domain predicted to face the Golgi lumen. The mouse CT-GalNAc
transferase cDNA shares 51% nucleotide identity with the human cDNA
encoding GM2/GD2 synthase (B4GALNT1; 601873), with highest identity in
the region encoding the catalytic domain.

Dohi et al. (1996) obtained a partial human B4GALNT2 sequence by RT-PCR
of gastric mucosa RNA using primers based on mouse CT-GalNAcT. The human
cDNA fragment shared 86% nucleotide identity with mouse CT-GalNAc
transferase and 63% identity with human GM2/GD2 GalNAc transferase.
Northern blot analysis detected a 2-kb B4GALNT2 transcript in normal
gastric mucosa. RT-PCR detected expression in normal human stomach,
jejunum, and ileum, with a proximal-to-distal gradient of expression in
colon.

By searching databases for sequence similar to mouse B4galnt2, followed
by RT-PCR and 5-prime RACE of a human colon carcinoma cell line, Montiel
et al. (2003) cloned 2 variants of B4GALNT2. The longer transcript
encodes a deduced 566-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular
mass of 63.3 kD. It contains an N-terminal cytosolic domain, followed by
a transmembrane domain and a long catalytic domain. The shorter
transcript encodes a deduced 506-amino acid protein with calculated
molecular mass of 57.0 kD. It has a different N-terminal cytosolic
domain than the full-length form. Northern blot analysis detected
B4GALNT2 transcripts of 8.8, 6.1, 4.7, 3.8, and 1.65 kb. Highest
expression was in colon, with lower expression in kidney, stomach,
ileum, and rectum. RNA dot blot analysis showed basal and low expression
of B4GALNT2 in all normal tissues examined, and RT-PCR detected
expression in several cancer cell lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Montiel et al. (2003) determined that the B4GALNT2 gene contains at
least 12 exons, including 2 alternatively spliced first exons, and spans
more than 36 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Montiel et al. (2003) mapped the B4GALNT2
gene to chromosome 17q23.1. The mouse gene maps to chromosome 11 in a
region that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 17 (Mohlke et
al., 1999).

GENE FUNCTION

By biochemical analysis, Smith and Lowe (1994) confirmed that mouse
CT-GalNAc transferase synthesized the epitope recognized by human
anti-Sd(a) serum.

Using RT-PCR, Dohi et al. (1996) found that 6 of 9 cases of gastric
cancer and 9 of 13 cases of colonic cancer lacked B4GALNT2 transcript.
These results correlated with a lack of B4GALNT2 activity measured in
the same samples. Dohi et al. (1996) concluded that reduced B4GALNT2
transcription results in disappearance of the Sd(a) epitope in
gastrointestinal cancer.

Montiel et al. (2003) found that a soluble B4GALNT2 protein N-terminally
truncated at gly89 could transfer N-acetylgalactosamine to several
natural and synthetic acceptor substrates, but it required a galactose
residue to be beta-1,3-linked to an N-acetylglucosamine or
N-acetylgalactosamine residue or beta-1,4-linked to glucose or an
N-acetylglucosamine residue.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

ANIMAL MODEL

Type I von Willebrand disease (VWD1; 193400), characterized by reduced
levels of plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF; 613160), is the most common
inherited bleeding disorder in humans. Mohlke et al. (1996) noted that
penetrance of VWD is incomplete, and expression of the bleeding
phenotype is highly variable. In addition, plasma VWF levels vary widely
among normal individuals. It is likely that the wide range of severity,
variable expressivity, and incomplete penetrance of von Willebrand
disease eventually may be explained through a complex series of
interactions between the VWF gene and a variety of modifier genes,
including proteins involved in posttranslational processing and other
aspects of VWF biosynthesis and clearance. To identify genes that
influence VWF level, Mohlke et al. (1996) analyzed a genetic cross
between 2 strains of mice that exhibit a 20-fold difference in plasma
Vwf levels (Sweeney et al., 1990). DNA samples from F2 progeny
demonstrating either extremely high or extremely low plasma Vwf levels
were pooled and phenotyped for 41 markers spanning the autosomal genome.
A novel locus accounting for 63% of the total variance in Vwf levels was
mapped to distal mouse chromosome 11, a site distinct from the murine
Vwf locus on chromosome 6. Mohlke et al. (1996) designated the locus
Mvwf for 'modifier of Vwf.' Additional genotyping of as many as 2,407
meioses established a high resolution genetic map placing the gene
between Ngfr (162010) and Hoxb9 (142964), and it was closely linked to
Gip (137240). The Mvwf candidate interval between Ngfr and Hoxb9 was
approximately 0.5 cM. The results of Mohlke et al. (1996) demonstrated
that a single dominant gene accounted for the low Vwf phenotype of 1
strain of mice and crosses with several other strains. The pattern of
inheritance suggested a gain-of-function mutation in a unique component
of Vwf biosynthesis or processing. They commented that characterization
of the human homolog for Mvwf may have relevance for a subset of type 1
VWD cases and may define an important genetic factor modifying
penetrance and expression of mutations at the VWF locus.

GALGT2 is expressed primarily in the gut epithelium in both mice and
humans. Mohlke et al. (1999) found that Mvwf, the gene responsible for
modifying plasma levels of Vwf in a strain of mice, was Galgt2. They
showed that the mutation causing deficiency of Vwf changed expression of
the gene from gut specific to the vascular endothelium. Ginsburg (1999)
expressed the opinion that the same alteration is highly unlikely in
humans. However, the Mvwf modifier gene effect may be a useful paradigm
for understanding genetic modification of plasma VWF levels.

607380	TITLE *607380 TRAF3-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; TRAF3IP1
;;MICROTUBULE-INTERACTING PROTEIN ASSOCIATED WITH TRAF3; MIPT3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using TRAF3 (601896) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Ling and
Goeddel (2000) obtained a partial MIPT3 sequence, which they used as
probe to obtain the full-length cDNA from a HeLa cell cDNA library. The
deduced 625-amino acid protein contains a KKE motif and a C-terminal
coiled-coil domain. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of 4.4-
and 2.4-kb transcripts in all tissues examined. Testis also expressed a
2.7-kb transcript. Ling and Goeddel (2000) determined that the 4.4- and
2.4-kb transcripts encode the same open reading frame, with the longer
transcript containing an extra 2 kb of 3-prime untranslated region.
Western blot analysis revealed that endogenous MIPT3 has an apparent
molecular mass of 83 kD.

MAPPING

Scott (2002) mapped the MIPT3 gene to chromosome 2q37.3 based on
sequence similarity between the MIPT3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
AF230877) and the chromosome 2 clones RP11-7908 (GenBank GENBANK
AC013400) and RP11-40B20 (GenBank GENBANK AC016999).

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation studies, Ling
and Goeddel (2000) determined that the interaction between MIPT3 and
TRAF3 is specific. MIPT3 did not significantly interact with any other
TRAF family members tested. By in vitro binding studies of truncated
proteins, Ling and Goeddel (2000) found that the interaction required
the coiled-coil TRAF-N domain of TRAF3 and the C-terminal coiled-coil
domain of MIPT3. When expressed separately, both MIPT3 and TRAF3 showed
a cytosolic localization, but when coexpressed, both proteins
colocalized with tubulin (see 191130) in cytoskeletal structures. MIPT3
bound to Taxol-stabilized microtubules and to tubulin in vitro, and
MIPT3 recruited TRAF3 to microtubules when both proteins were
overexpressed in HeLa cells. Mutation analysis of in vitro translated
MIPT3 revealed that the tubulin-binding domain of MIPT3 resides within
the N-terminal region.

Omori et al. (2008) identified elipsa, the zebrafish ortholog of
TRAF3IP1, as a component of intraflagellar transport particles, which
are involved in the formation and function of cilia. Elipsa interacted
with rabaptin-5 (RABEP1; 603616), a regulator of endocytosis, and
rabaptin-5 in turn interacted with Rab8 (RAB8A; 165040), a small GTPase
localized to cilia. Omori et al. (2008) concluded that elipsa,
rabaptin-5, and Rab8 provide a bridge between the intraflagellar
transport particle and protein complexes that assemble at the ciliary
membrane.

;;GNP1;;
GNPI;;
OSCILLIN, HAMSTER, HOMOLOG OF;;
KIAA0060
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (EC 3.5.99.6) is an allosteric enzyme
that catalyzes the reversible conversion of D-glucosamine-6-phosphate
into D-fructose-6-phosphate and ammonium (Arreola et al., 2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from the KG-1 immature myeloid cell line,
Nomura et al. (1994) cloned GNPDA1, which they designated KIAA0060. The
deduced protein contains 289 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
detected GNPDA1 expression in all human tissues and cell lines examined,
with highest expression in ovary and colon and in KG-1 and HeLa cell
lines.

The hamster sperm oscillin protein is responsible for oocyte calcium
oscillations. By screening a testis cDNA library for a homolog of
hamster oscillin, Shevchenko et al. (1998) obtained a cDNA encoding
GNPI. The deduced 289-amino acid protein is 96% identical to the hamster
sequence. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis showed that GNPI was
expressed as a 33-kD cytosolic protein in various cell lines.

By screening a mouse EST database for sequences similar to hamster
oscillin, followed by screening human BAC genomic libraries by PCR,
Nakamura et al. (2000) identified the GNPI gene. Northern and dot blot
analyses revealed ubiquitous expression that was highest in spleen,
ovary, kidney, uterus, and testis. Promoter analysis indicated that GNPI
is most likely a housekeeping gene.

GENE FUNCTION

In the course of investigating hexosamine catabolism in the human
malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, Weidanz et al. (1995) became
aware of deficiencies in understanding the relevant enzymatic reactions
in the host erythrocyte. For that reason, they undertook studies of
human glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase using a newly developed
sensitive radiometric assay. They characterized biochemically the
erythrocyte enzyme and reported data on its kinetics, temperature
stability, and chromatographic purification. Weidanz et al. (1995) noted
that the nucleotide sequence of the nagB gene, encoding the deaminase in
E. coli K12, had been determined (Rogers et al., 1988).

Functional analysis by Shevchenko et al. (1998) showed that GNPI had
glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase activity. However, it did not induce
calcium oscillations in mammalian eggs.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Arreola et al. (2003) solved the crystal structure of human GNP1 in the
presence of an allosteric activator, a competitive inhibitor, ammonia,
inorganic sulfate, and a cryoprotectant to 1.75-angstrom resolution.
They found that, like E. coli Gnp1, human GNP1 formed a 6-monomer unit.
However, each of the 6 GNP1 monomers showed a different conformation for
the active-site lid, and all conformations differed from that observed
in the E. coli enzyme. Moreover, all human GNP1 monomers differed from
E. coli Gnp1 in the phosphate-binding loop.

GENE STRUCTURE

Shevchenko et al. (1998) determined that the single-copy GNPI gene
contains 8 exons.

Nakamura et al. (2000) found that the GNPI gene spans approximately 12.4
kb and contains 8 exons.

Arreola et al. (2003) determined that the GNPDA1 gene contains 6 exons.

5q31.

601613	TITLE *601613 CHEMOKINE, CXC MOTIF, RECEPTOR 5; CXCR5
;;BURKITT LYMPHOMA RECEPTOR 1; BLR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dobner et al. (1992) and Kaiser et al. (1993) identified a novel member
of the G protein-coupled receptor family termed BLR1 (BLR1 having been
identified from Burkitt lymphoma).

GENE FUNCTION

B lymphocytes recirculate between B cell-rich compartments (follicles or
B zones) in secondary lymphoid organs, surveying for antigen. After
antigen binding, B cells move to the boundary of B and T zones to
interact with T-helper cells. Reif et al. (2002) demonstrated that
antigen-engaged B cells have increased expression of CCR7 (600242), the
receptor for the T-zone chemokines CCL19 (602227) and CCL21 (602737),
and that they exhibit increased responsiveness to both chemoattractants.
In mice lacking lymphoid CCL19 and CCL21 chemokines, or with B cells
that lack CCR7, antigen engagement fails to cause movement to the T
zone. Using retroviral-mediated gene transfer, the authors demonstrated
that increased expression of CCR7 is sufficient to direct B cells to the
T zone. Reciprocally, overexpression of CXCR5, the receptor for the
B-zone chemokine CXCL13 (also known as BLC), is sufficient to overcome
antigen-induced B-cell movement to the T zone. Reif et al. (2002)
concluded that their findings defined the mechanism of B-cell
relocalization in response to antigen, and established that cell
position in vivo can be determined by the balance of responsiveness to
chemoattractants made in separate but adjacent zones.

Chan et al. (2003) investigated the expression of chemokines and
chemokine receptors in eyes with primary intraocular B-cell lymphoma
(PIOL). All 3 PIOL eyes showed similar pathology, with typical diffuse
large B-lymphoma cells between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and
Bruch membrane. The eyes also showed a similar chemokine profile with
the expression of CXCR4 (162643) and CXCR5 in the lymphoma cells. CXCL13
(BLC) and CXCL12 (600835) transcripts were found only in the RPE and not
in the malignant cells. No chemokine expression was detected on the RPE
cells of a normal control eye. Since chemokines and chemokine receptors
selective for B cells were identified in RPE and malignant B cells in
eyes with PIOL, inhibition of B-cell chemoattractants might be a future
strategy for the treatment of PIOL.

The germinal center (GC) is organized into dark and light zones. B cells
in the dark zone, called centroblasts, undergo rapid proliferation and
somatic hypermutation of their antibody variable genes. Centroblasts
then become smaller, nondividing centrocytes and undergo selection in
the light zone based on the affinity of their surface antibody for the
inducing antigen. The light zone also contains helper T cells and
follicular dendritic cells that sequester antigen. Failure to
differentiate results in centrocyte apoptosis, whereas centrocytes that
bind antigen and receive T-cell help emigrate from the GC as long-lived
plasma cells or memory B cells. Some centrocytes may also return to the
dark zone for further proliferation and mutation. Using genetic and
pharmacologic approaches, Allen et al. (2004) showed that CXCR4 was
essential for GC dark and light zone segregation. In the presence of the
antiapoptotic BCL2 (151430), B cells had robust chemotactic responses to
the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12, as well as to CXCL13, the ligand for CXCR5.
CXCL12 was more abundant in the dark zone, and CXCR4 was more abundant
on centroblasts than centrocytes. In contrast, CXCR5 helped direct cells
to the CXCL13-positive light zone, but was not essential for segregation
of the 2 zones. CXCL13 and CXCR5 were required for correct positioning
of the light zone. Allen et al. (2004) concluded that these chemokines
and their receptors are critical for movement of cells to different
parts of the GC and for creating the distinct histologic appearance of
the GC.

Using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, Cagigi et al. (2008)
found that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see
609423)-seropositive patients, particularly those with low CD4
(186940)-positive T-cell counts, had reduced expression of CXCR5 on B
cells, whereas expression of its ligand, CXCL13, was increased. CXCL13
was secreted upon B-cell activation. CXCL13-positive B cells were
present in lymph nodes of HIV-1-seropositive patients, but not in
control tissue. Cagigi et al. (2008) concluded that altered expression
of CXCR5 and CXCL13 may be involved in B-cell dysfunction during HIV-1
infection.

ANIMAL MODEL

Forster et al. (1996) described the phenotype of gene-targeted mice
lacking the putative chemokine receptor Blr1. In normal mice, this
receptor is expressed on mature B cells and a subpopulation of T helper
cells. Blr1-mutant mice lack inguinal lymph nodes and possess no or only
a few phenotypically abnormal Peyer patches. The migration of
lymphocytes into splenic follicles was severely impaired, resulting in
morphologically altered primary lymphoid follicles. Furthermore,
activated B cells failed to migrate from the T cell-rich zone into
B-cell follicles of the spleen, and despite high numbers of germinal
center founder cells, no functional germinal centers developed in this
organ. These results identified BLR1 as the first G protein-coupled
receptor involved in B cell migration and localization of these cells
within specific anatomic compartments.

CXCR5 was known to be required for B cell migration to splenic
follicles, but the requirements for homing to B-cell areas and lymph
nodes remained to be defined. Ansel et al. (2000) demonstrated that
lymph nodes contain 2 types of B cell-rich compartment: follicles
containing follicular dendritic cells, and areas lacking such cells.
Ansel et al. (2000) generated mice deficient in the B-lymphocyte
chemoattractant (BLC; 605149), for which CXCR5 is the receptor, by
targeted disruption. BLC-deficient mice were similar in appearance to
mice deficient in CXCR5. However, CXCR5-deficient mice have less severe
deficiency in Peyer patches. Using BLC-deficient mice, Ansel et al.
(2000) established that BLC and CXCR5 are needed for B-cell homing to
follicles in lymph nodes as well as in spleen. They also found that BLC
is required for the development of most lymph nodes and Peyer patches.
In addition to mediating chemoattraction, BLC induces B cells to
upregulate membrane lymphotoxin alpha-1-beta-2 (see 600978), a cytokine
that promotes follicular dendritic cell development and BLC expression,
establishing a positive feedback loop thought to be important in
follicle development and homeostasis. In germinal centers, the feedback
loop is overridden, with B cell lymphotoxin alpha-1-beta-2 expression
being induced by a mechanism independent of BLC.

Voigt et al. (2000) found that B cells and dendritic cells do
colocalize, albeit aberrantly, even in the absence of CXCR5. In mice
lacking Cxcr5, both cell types were found in a broad ring around the
sinuses of the marginal zones. Voigt et al. (2000) concluded that in
Cxcr5-deficient mice, the organization of splenic primary follicles is
severely impaired. However, within the T cell zone a microenvironment is
built up, which provides all requirements needed for the affinity
maturation to take place.

Prinz et al. (2003) found that in mice deficient in Cxcr5 the follicular
dendritic cells (FDCs) are juxtaposed to major splenic nerves and the
transfer of intraperitoneally-administered prions (see 176640) into the
spinal cord is accelerated. Neuroinvasion velocity correlated
exclusively with the relative locations of FDCs and nerves; transfer of
Cxcr5 -/- bone marrow to wildtype mice induced perineural FDCs and
enhanced neuroinvasion, whereas reciprocal transfer to Cxcr5 -/- mice
abolished them and restored normal efficiency of neuroinvasion.
Suppression of lymphotoxin signaling depleted FDCs, abolished splenic
infectivity, and suppressed acceleration of pathogenesis in Cxcr5 -/-
mice. Prinz et al. (2003) concluded that their data suggests that prion
neuroimmune transition occurs between FDCs and sympathetic nerves, and
relative positioning of FDCs and nerves controls the efficiency of
peripheral prion infection.

600505	TITLE *600505 CASEIN KINASE I, ALPHA-1; CSNK1A1
;;CK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tapia et al. (1994) isolated a cDNA encoding human casein kinase I from
a fetal brain library using PCR primers based on the bovine sequence.
The cDNA was sequenced and shown to have a predicted amino acid sequence
identical to the bovine protein except that it contains 12 additional
amino acids at the carboxyl end.

GENE FUNCTION

Jia et al. (2004) showed that protein kinase A (PKA; see 188830) and
casein kinase I (CKI) regulate Smo (601500) cell surface accumulation
and activity in response to hedgehog (Hh; see 600725). Blocking PKA or
CKI activity in the Drosophila wing disc prevented Hh-induced Smo
accumulation and attenuated pathway activity, whereas increasing PKA
activity promoted Smo accumulation and pathway activation. Jia et al.
(2004) showed that PKA and CKI phosphorylate Smo at several sites, and
that phosphorylation-deficient forms of Smo fail to accumulate on the
cell surface and are unable to transduce the Hh signal. Conversely,
phosphorylation-mimicking Smo variants showed constitutive cell surface
expression and signaling activity. Furthermore, Jia et al. (2004) found
that the levels of Smo cell surface expression and activity correlated
with its levels of phosphorylation. Jia et al. (2004) concluded that Hh
induces progressive Smo phosphorylation by PKA and CKI, leading to
elevation of Smo cell surface levels and signaling activity.

Bidere et al. (2009) conducted parallel screens involving a mass
spectrometry analysis of CARMA1 (607210) binding partners and an RNA
interference screen for growth inhibition of the CBM-dependent
'activated B cell-like' (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL; see 605027). Bidere et al. (2009) reported that both screens
identified CK1-alpha as a bifunctional regulator of NF-kappa-B (164011).
CK1-alpha dynamically associates with the CBM complex on T cell receptor
engagement to participate in cytokine production and lymphocyte
proliferation. However, CK1-alpha kinase activity has a contrasting role
by subsequently promoting the phosphorylation and inactivation of
CARMA1. CK1-alpha has thus a dual 'gating' function which first promotes
and then terminates receptor-induced NF-kappa-B. ABC DLBCL cells
required CK1-alpha for constitutive NF-kappa-B activity, indicating that
CK1-alpha functions as a conditionally essential malignancy gene.

Elyada et al. (2011) showed that casein kinase I-alpha, a component of
the beta-catenin (116806) destruction complex, is a critical regulator
of the Wnt signaling (see 164820) pathway. Inducing the ablation of
Csnk1a1 in the gut triggers massive Wnt activation, surprisingly without
causing tumorigenesis. CKI-alpha-deficient epithelium shows many of the
features of human colorectal tumors in addition to Wnt activation, in
particular the induction of the DNA damage response and cellular
senescence, both of which are thought to provide a barrier against
malignant transformation. The epithelial DNA damage response in mice is
accompanied by substantial activation of p53 (191170), suggesting that
the p53 pathway may counteract the protumorigenic effects of Wnt
hyperactivation. Notably, the transition from benign adenomas to
invasive colorectal cancer in humans is typically linked to p53
inactivation, underscoring the importance of p53 as a safeguard against
malignant progression; however, the mechanism of p53-mediated tumor
suppression is unknown. Elyada et al. (2011) showed that the maintenance
of intestinal homeostasis in CKI-alpha-deficient gut requires
p53-mediated growth control, because the combined ablation of Csnk1a1
and either p53 or its target gene p21 (116899) triggered high-grade
dysplasia with extensive proliferation. Unexpectedly, these ablations
also induced nonproliferating cells to invade the villous lamina propria
rapidly, producing invasive carcinomas throughout the small bowel.
Furthermore, in p53-deficient gut, loss of heterozygosity of the gene
encoding CKI-alpha caused a highly invasive carcinoma, indicating that
CKI-alpha caused a highly invasive carcinoma, indicating that CKI-alpha
functions as a tumor suppressor when p53 is inactivated. Elyada et al.
(2011) identified a set of genes (the p53-suppressed invasiveness
signature, PSIS) that is activated by the loss of both p53 and CKI-alpha
and which probably accounts for the brisk induction of invasiveness.
PSIS transcription and tumor invasion were suppressed by p21,
independently of cell cycle control. Restraining tissue invasion through
suppressing PSIS expression is thus a novel tumor suppressor function of
wildtype p53. PROX1 (601546), IFITM2 (605578), and IFITM3 (605579) are
all PSIS genes.

MAPPING

Tapia et al. (1994) identified YAC genomic clones containing the human
gene and used them to map CKI to chromosome 13q13. Fish et al. (1995)
mapped the CSNK1A1 gene to chromosome 13q13.1-q14.1 by FISH. However,
Gross (2011) mapped the CSNK1A1 gene to chromosome 5q32 based on an
alignment of the CSNK1A1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC008717) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lahn and Page (1997) isolated PRY2 among testis cDNAs corresponding to
genes located in the nonrecombining portion of the Y chromosome. PRY2 is
1 of 3 PRY genes they identified in this region. Northern blot analysis
of several tissues detected PRY expression only in testis.

MAPPING

By analysis of a panel of partial Y chromosomes, Lahn and Page (1997)
mapped PRY genes to regions 6C (PRY2) and 6E (PRY1; 400019) on the long
arm of the Y chromosome, and to region 4A on Yp. Skaletsky et al. (2003)
determined that the region of chromosome Yq containing PRY1 and PRY2 is
palindromic.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Repping et al. (2004) identified the b2/b3 deletion within the AZFc
region (415000) of the Y chromosome, in which both PRY1 and PRY2 are
deleted. The b2/b3 deletion has no obvious effect on fitness.

600367	TITLE *600367 CLEAVAGE STIMULATION FACTOR, 3-PRIME PRE-RNA, SUBUNIT 3, 77-KD; CSTF3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Polyadenylation of mRNA precursors is a complex process that requires
multiple protein factors, including cleavage stimulation factor (CSTF),
a cleavage-polyadenylation specificity factor (see 603052), 2 cleavage
factors, and poly(A)+ polymerase. CSTF is composed of 3 subunits: CSTF1
(600369), CSFT2 (300907), and CSTF3 (Takagaki and Manley, 1994).

CLONING

Takagaki and Manley (1994) cloned human CSTF3, which encodes a 77-kD
protein homologous to Drosophila 'suppressor of forked' (suf) and yeast
Rna14, both of which are involved in mRNA processing.

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 11 associated with WAGR
syndrome (194072), Gawin et al. (1999) identified and cloned CSTF3.
Northern blot analysis of several human tissues detected a 3.2-kb
transcript predominantly in lung. In mouse, Cstf3 expression was strong
during embryonic development beginning at embryonic day 11 and much
weaker in adult tissues.

MAPPING

By analysis of a PAC contig covering chromosome 11p14.1-p13, Gawin et
al. (1999) mapped the CSTF3 gene to chromosome 11p13, centromeric to the
TR2 gene (DEPDC7; 612294) and telomeric to the G2 gene (C11ORF41;
612297).

By sequencing cDNAs randomly selected from a cDNA library derived from

a cDNA encoding RRP42, which they designated KIAA0116. The predicted
290-amino acid KIAA0116 protein is 26.7% identical to the 75-kD
autoantigen (PMSCL1; 606180) over a 225-amino acid region. Northern blot
analysis detected expression of KIAA0116 in all tissues tested.

Inherently unstable mammalian mRNAs contain AU-rich elements (AREs)
within their 3-prime untranslated regions. In yeast, 3-prime-to-5-prime
mRNA degradation is mediated by the exosome, a multisubunit particle.
Chen et al. (2001) purified and characterized the human exosome by mass
spectrometry and found its composition to be similar to its yeast
counterpart. They identified the following protein subunits within the
human exosome: p7, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp4 protein
(602238); p8, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp42 protein; p9, which
is homologous to the yeast Rrp43 protein (OIP2; 606019); p10, which is
homologous to the yeast Rrp40 protein (606489); p11, which is homologous
to the yeast Mtr3 protein (606490); p12A, which is homologous to the
yeast Rrp41 protein (606491); p12B, which is homologous to the yeast
Rrp46 protein (606492); and p13, which is homologous to the yeast Csl4
protein (606493). They also identified 2 exosome-associated factors, p1
(600478) and p14 (MPP6; 605500), that were not homologous to any yeast
exosome components.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a cell-free RNA decay system, Chen et al. (2001) demonstrated that
the mammalian exosome is required for rapid degradation of
ARE-containing RNAs but not for poly(A) shortening. They found that the
mammalian exosome does not recognize ARE-containing RNAs on its own. ARE
recognition required certain ARE-binding proteins that could interact
with the exosome and recruit it to unstable RNAs, thereby promoting
their rapid degradation.

Using mammalian 2-hybrid and GST pull-down analyses, Raijmakers et al.
(2002) found that the CSL4 protein, but not mutant forms lacking N- or
C-terminal residues, interacted directly with RRP42 and RRP46. The
deletion mutants were also unable to interact with the exosome. RRP42
and RRP46 did not interact with each other.

MAPPING

By analysis of a panel of human/rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al.
(1995) mapped the KIAA0116 gene to chromosome 3.

604885	TITLE *604885 MYB-BINDING PROTEIN 1A; MYBBP1A
;;P160
DESCRIPTION The protooncogene MYB (189990) is predominantly expressed in immature
hemopoietic cells where it plays an important role in hemopoietic cell
proliferation and differentiation. Oncogenically activated forms of MYB
are generally N- and/or C-terminal truncations of the normal MYB
protein. Removal of the C terminus of MYB disrupts or deletes a region
termed the negative regulatory domain (NRD), resulting in an increase in
DNA binding, transactivation, and transformation by MYB. One feature of
the NRD is a leucine zipper-like motif. Point mutations that disrupt
this motif also enhance the transactivating and transforming potential
of MYB. Murine Myb-binding protein-1a (Mybbp1a), originally called P160,
was identified by its ability to interact specifically with Myb via this
leucine zipper-like motif (Favier and Gonda, 1994, Tavner et al., 1998).
Thus, it was suggested that Mybbp1a may modulate MYB activity upon
binding to the MYB NRD. Mybbp1a is ubiquitously expressed. By screening
a human genomic library with a mouse Mybbp1a cDNA, Keough et al. (1999)
isolated a portion of the human MYBBP1A gene, which they also called
P160. Using the genomic sequence, they cloned a full-length human
MYBBP1A cDNA. The predicted 1,328-amino acid MYBBP1A contains a central
acidic region, C-terminal basic amino acid repeats, and a number of
potential leucine charged domain motifs throughout the protein. Human
MYBBP1A shares approximately 80% amino acid sequence similarity with
both mouse and rat Mybbp1a. Northern blot analysis detected an
approximately 4.5-kb MYBBP1A transcript in all human cell lines
examined, namely kidney epithelial, erythroleukemic, cervical carcinoma,
and foreskin fibroblast cell lines. Keough et al. (1999) found that
human ESTs corresponding to MYBBP1A are expressed in a wide range of
tissues, suggesting that MYBBP1A is expressed ubiquitously.

By FISH, Keough et al. (1999) mapped the human MYBBP1A gene to 17p13.3.
Using radiation hybrid mapping, they found that the MYBBP1A gene is
closely associated with marker D17S816E, which is located between
markers D17S1828 and D17S938 in 17p13. Tavner et al. (1998) mapped the
mouse Mybbp1a gene to chromosome 11.

605424	TITLE *605424 MASTERMIND-LIKE 1; MAML1
;;MASTERMIND, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; MAM1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Notch receptors (see NOTCH2; 600275) are involved in cell-fate
determination in organisms as diverse as flies, frogs, and humans. The
'mastermind' gene has been identified in multiple genetic screens for
modifiers of Notch mutations in Drosophila. Using a yeast 2-hybrid
system on a HeLa cell cDNA library, Wu et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA
encoding MAML1, a human homolog of Drosophila mastermind. The MAML1 gene
encodes a 130-kD, 1,016-amino acid protein that localizes to nuclear
bodies. MAML1 shares 24% amino acid identity with Drosophila mastermind
and is identical to the KIAA0200 protein reported by Nagase et al.
(1996). Northern blot analysis detected a single 6-kb MAML1 transcript
in all tissues tested, with an additional 1-kb transcript in placenta.

GENE FUNCTION

Wu et al. (2000) found that MAML1 bound to the ankyrin repeat domain of
all 4 mammalian Notch receptors and amplified Notch-induced
transcription of HES1 (139605). They concluded that MAML1 functions as a
transcriptional coactivator for Notch signaling.

Moellering et al. (2009) reported the design of synthetic,
cell-permeable, stabilized alpha-helical peptides that target a critical
protein-protein interface in the NOTCH transactivation complex. The
authors demonstrated that direct, high-affinity binding of the
hydrocarbon-stapled peptide SAHM1 (stapled alpha-helical peptide derived
from MAML1) prevents assembly of the active transcriptional complex.
Inappropriate NOTCH activation is directly implicated in the
pathogenesis of several disease states, including T-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). The treatment of leukemic cells with
SAHM1 resulted in genomewide suppression of NOTCH-activated genes.
Direct antagonism of the NOTCH transcriptional program caused potent,
NOTCH-specific antiproliferative effects in cultured cells and in a
mouse model of NOTCH1 (190198)-driven T-ALL.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the MAML1 gene
to chromosome 5.

ANIMAL MODEL

Maml1 -/- mice fail to thrive, exhibit severe muscular dystrophy, and
die within 10 days of birth (Shen et al., 2006). To study the
hematopoietic effects of Maml1 deficiency, Wu et al. (2007) transplanted
Maml1 -/- fetal liver cells into lethally irradiated wildtype recipient
mice. Maml1 deficiency minimally affected T-cell development, but it
eliminated development of marginal zone B cells, a phenotype similar to
that of Notch2 deficiency. Moreover, the number of marginal zone B cells
correlated with Maml1 gene dosage. Since all 3 Maml genes were expressed
in marginal zone B cells and their precursors, Wu et al. (2007)
concluded that Maml1 is specifically required for Notch2 signaling in
marginal zone B cells.

;;WILLIAMS-BEUREN SYNDROME CHROMOSOME REGION 1; WBSCR1;;
WSCR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Osborne et al. (1996) identified the WBSCR1 gene within the
Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; 194050) critical region at 7q11.23. The
WSCR1 gene encodes a deduced 232 amino acids, including an RNA-binding
domain consensus sequence. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.5-kb
WBSCR1 transcript in all human cell lines analyzed.

Richter-Cook et al. (1998) identified the eukaryotic initiation factor
(EIF) 4H protein from rabbit reticulocyte lysate on the basis of its
ability to stimulate translation in an in vitro globin synthesis assay
deficient in EIF4B (603928) and EIF4F. Amino acid sequence analysis of 3
EIF4H tryptic fragments revealed 100% sequence identity to the human
WBSCR1 protein. The authors demonstrated that the 25-kD rabbit EIF4H
protein stimulates the in vitro activities of EIF4B and EIF4F in globin
synthesis, as well as the in vitro RNA-dependent ATPase activities of
EIF4A (e.g., 601102), EIF4B, and EIF4F.

MAPPING

Osborne et al. (1996) characterized a 500-kb region in 7q11.23 that was
deleted in a collection of 30 William-Beuren syndrome patients. They
constructed a detailed physical map of the region consisting of cosmids,
P1 artificial chromosomes, and yeast artificial chromosomes. They
identified 9 transcription units from the area, including the previously
characterized genes ELN (130160), LIMK1 (601329), and RFC2 (600404), and
the novel genes WSCR1 and WSCR4 (603432).

GENE STRUCTURE

Osborne et al. (1996) determined that the WSCR1 gene has 6 exons.

602617	TITLE *602617 FORKHEAD BOX E1; FOXE1
;;FORKHEAD, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG-LIKE 15; FKHL15;;
THYROID TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2; TTF2;;
TITF2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The 'forkhead' gene family, originally identified in Drosophila, encodes
transcription factors with a conserved 100-amino acid DNA-binding motif
called the 'forkhead domain'. Chadwick et al. (1997) isolated FKHL15
cDNAs from a cDNA library enriched for transcripts from 9q22. The
predicted 376-amino acid FKHL15 protein contains a 19-residue
polyalanine tract and 2 putative nuclear localization signals which
flank the forkhead domain. Northern blot analysis detected a single
4.5-kb FKHL15 mRNA in a variety of tissues and multiple FKHL15
transcripts in others.

Clifton-Bligh et al. (1998) found by a database search against the rat
TTF2 gene more than 90% homology with FKHL15. A probe specific to the
3-prime UTR of FKHL15 detected a 5.3-kb transcript that was highly
expressed in thyroid tissues, and a second 3.2-kb transcript seen in
both thyroid and testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Clifton-Bligh et al. (1998) found that the FKHL15 gene consists of a
single exon.

MAPPING

Chadwick et al. (1997) localized the FKHL15 gene to 9q22 by somatic cell
hybrid analysis and by its inclusion in cosmids that map to that region.

GENE FUNCTION

Thyroid gland organogenesis involves the dorso-caudal migration of a
median endodermal bud that originates from the posterior region of the
pharyngeal floor. The thyroid primordium migrates to the area located
between the fourth pharyngeal pouches and eventually fuses with them.
The adult thyroid gland is composed of cells derived from all 3 germ
layers, but thyroid follicular cells (TFCs), which are responsible for
thyroid hormone biosynthesis, appear to derive primarily from the median
primordium, though a contribution from the endoderm of the pharyngeal
pouches has also been proposed (Manley and Capecchi, 1998). Functional
differentiation, as shown by the expression of thyroglobulin, occurs in
TFCs following migration, suggesting that migration and functional
differentiation may be mutually exclusive. Three transcription factors,
TTF1 (NKX2-1; 600635), TTF2, and PAX8 (167415), are present from the
start of thyroid morphogenesis. TTF2, which is also expressed in most of
the foregut endoderm, in the craniopharyngeal ectoderm involved in
palate formation and in the Rathke pouch, is transiently expressed at
these sites from embryonic day (E) 8-8.5 to E13.5. The mRNA encoding
TTF2 is downregulated in TFC precursors following their migration and
just before their differentiation (summary by De Felice et al., 1998).
De Felice et al. (1998) reported that Zannini et al. (1997) suggested
that TTF2 is involved either in promoting the migration process or in
repressing differentiation of the TFCs until migration has occurred.
Thus, De Felice et al. (1998) predicted that the absence of TTF2 would
result in alteration of thyroid primordium migration and/or precocious
functional differentiation.

Brancaccio et al. (2004) reported that Foxe1 was specifically expressed
in the lower undifferentiated compartment of hair follicles in mouse
skin, at a time and site that parallel activation of the Shh (600725)
signaling pathway. Foxe1 protein was also expressed in human and mouse
basal cell carcinoma in which hedgehog signaling is constitutively
activated, whereas it was undetectable in normal epidermis and squamous
cell carcinoma. Expression of a dominant-negative form of Gli2 (165230)
in mouse skin resulted in complete suppression of Foxe1 expression in
hair follicles, whereas transcriptionally active Gli2 stimulated
activity of the Foxe1 promoter. Foxe1-null skin that was grafted to
immunodeficient mice displayed thin and curly pelage hairs, as well as
disoriented, misaligned, and aberrantly shaped hair follicles.
Brancaccio et al. (2004) concluded that the defect in Bamforth-Lazarus
syndrome is due to altered FOXE1 function in the hair follicle and is
independent of systemic defects present in affected individuals. They
further hypothesized that Foxe1 is a downstream target of the Shh/Gli
pathway in hair follicle morphogenesis and plays a crucial role in
correct hair follicle orientation into the dermis and subcutis.

To gain insight into human thyroid development and thyroid
dysgenesis-associated malformations, Trueba et al. (2005) studied the
expression patterns of the PAX8, TITF1, and FOXE1 genes during human
development. PAX8 and TITF1 were first expressed in the median thyroid
primordium. Interestingly, PAX8 was also expressed in the thyroglossal
duct and the ultimobranchial bodies. Human FOXE1 expression was detected
later than in the mouse. PAX8 was also expressed in the developing
central nervous system and kidney, including the ureteric bud and the
main collecting ducts. TITF1 was expressed in the ventral forebrain and
lung. FOXE1 expression was detected in the oropharyngeal epithelium and
thymus. The expression patterns of these genes in human show some
differences from those reported in the mouse; Pax8, Titf1, and Foxe1 are
expressed in the mouse thyroid bud as soon as it differentiates on the
pharyngeal floor. The authors concluded that the expression patterns of
these 3 genes correlate well with the phenotypes observed in patients
carrying mutations of the corresponding gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Hypothyroidism, Athyroidal, with Spiky Hair and Cleft Palate

Clifton-Bligh et al. (1998) demonstrated that the FKHL15 gene, which is
the human homolog of the mouse Titf2 gene, was homozygously mutated
(602617.0001) in 2 sibs with thyroid agenesis, cleft palate, and choanal
atresia, previously reported by Bamforth et al. (1989); see
Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome (241850). Spiky or curly hair was also a
feature, as was bifid epiglottis. Polyhydramnios, which was present in
the 2 pregnancies of the brothers and in another reported case of
Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome, may have been caused by the choanal atresia.

In 2 brothers with congenital hypothyroidism, athyreosis, and cleft
palate, Castanet et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for a missense
mutation in the FOXE1 gene (S57N; 602617.0002). The authors noted that
these patients had an incomplete clinical phenotype, lacking choanal
atresia and bifid epiglottis.

In a girl with Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome, Baris et al. (2006) identified
homozygosity for a missense mutation (R102C; 602617.0003) in the FOXE1
gene. The patient had congenital hypothyroidism, bilateral choanal
atresia, cleft palate, and spiky hair, but was not athyreotic.

- Thyroid Dysgenesis

Carre et al. (2007) analyzed FOXE1 alanine tract length in 115 patients
with thyroid dysgenesis (see CHNG1, 275200) and 129 controls. They found
that 16/16 and 16/14 genotypes were inversely associated with thyroid
dysgenesis (OR, 0.39; p = 0.0005), suggesting that FOXE1 with 16
alanines protects against occurrence of thyroid dysgenesis; the
protective effect was confirmed by transmission disequilibrium analysis
in 39 parent-proband trios. Conversely, the 14/14 genotype was
associated with an increased risk of thyroid dysgenesis (OR, 2.59; p =
0.0005). Expression studies showed that transcription activity of FOXE1
with 16 alanines was 1.55-fold higher than FOXE1 with 14 alanines (p
less than 0.003); nuclear localization of FOXE1 was not affected. Carre
et al. (2007) suggested that FOXE1 alanine tract length modulates
genetic susceptibility to thyroid dysgenesis.

- Nonsyndromic Orofacial Clefting

Nonsyndromic orofacial clefts are a common complex birth defect caused
by genetic and environmental factors and/or their interactions. In a
cohort of cleft lip and palate (CL/P; see 119530) families from
Colombia, United States, and the Philippines, Moreno et al. (2009)
tested 397 SNPs spanning 9q22-q33 for association. Significant SNP and
haplotype association signals narrowed the interval to a 200-kb region
containing FOXE1, C9ORF156, and HEMGN (610715). Association results were
replicated in CL/P families of European descent; when all populations
were combined, the 2 most associated SNPs, dbSNP rs3758249 (P =
5.01E-13) and dbSNP rs4460498 (P = 6.51E-12), were located inside a
70-kb high linkage disequilibrium block containing FOXE1. Association
signals for Caucasians and Asians clustered 5-prime and 3-prime of
FOXE1, respectively. Isolated cleft palate (CP) was also associated,
indicating that FOXE1 may play a role in 2 phenotypes thought to be
genetically distinct. Foxe1 expression was found in the epithelium
undergoing fusion between the medial nasal and maxillary processes.
Mutation screens of FOXE1 identified 2 family-specific missense
mutations (ile59 to ser and pro208 to arg) at highly conserved amino
acids. Although predicted to be benign by a computer program, both
mutations are near previously identified deleterious mutations. The
authors concluded that FOXE1 may be a major gene for CL/P and CP.

- Association with Thyroid Cancer

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
FOXE1 gene and thyroid cancer, see 188550 and 188470.

ANIMAL MODEL

Many members of the forkhead/winged-helix transcription factor family
are key regulators of embryogenesis (summary by Kaufmann and Knochel,
1996). Thyroid transcription factor-2 (TTF2), a forkhead
domain-containing transcription factor, was cloned by Zannini et al.
(1997) and the mouse gene, designated Titf2, was mapped to chromosome 4.
De Felice et al. (1998) showed that Titf2-null mutant mice exhibit cleft
palate and either a sublingual or completely absent thyroid gland. Thus,
the Titf2-/- mutation results in neonatal hypothyroidism that showed
similarity to thyroid dysgenesis in humans. Among the 1 in 3,000 or
4,000 newborns in which congenital hypothyroidism is detected, 80% have
either an ectopic, small and sublingual thyroid, or have no thyroid
tissue (Toublanc, 1992). Most of these cases appear sporadically,
although a few cases of recurring familial thyroid dysgenesis (218700)
have been reported.

HISTORY

By screening a human fetal brain cDNA library with the forkhead domain
of rat HNF3A (602294) as probe, Wiese et al. (1997) identified what they
considered to be a novel member of the forkhead family of transcription
factors, which they called HFKL5 and was later designated FOXE2 by the
HUGO gene nomenclature committee. As described by Wiese et al. (1997),
the full-length cDNA encodes a deduced 500-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of approximately 55 kD. The protein shows
little homology in the forkhead domain with other members of the
forkhead family. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb transcript in
all fetal and adult tissues tested. In situ hybridization studies
detected expression in differentiated fetal and adult neurons but not in
undifferentiated neurons, such as those in the periventricular matrix.
Expression was also detected in neuron-derived cells in various tissues,
such as the parasympathetic ganglia of the intestine, and in a subset of
hepatocytes, lymphatic tissue cells, and kidney tubule cells. Although
Wiese et al. (1997) stated that the HFKL5 gene maps to chromosome 22,
Scott (2007) found that this mapping is not supported by the human
genome build 36.2.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOTHYROIDISM, ATHYROIDAL, WITH SPIKY HAIR AND CLEFT PALATE
FOXE1, ALA65VAL

In 2 brothers with a syndrome of thyroid agenesis, cleft palate, and
choanal atresia originally reported by Bamforth et al. (1989) (see
241850), Clifton-Bligh et al. (1998) identified homozygosity for a
missense mutation at nucleotide 196, causing an ala-to-val substitution
at codon 65 in the predicted structure of the TTF2 protein.

.0002
HYPOTHYROIDISM, ATHYROIDAL, WITH SPIKY HAIR AND CLEFT PALATE
FOXE1, SER57ASN

Castanet et al. (2002) described 2 male sibs, born to consanguineous
parents, with congenital hypothyroidism, athyreosis, and cleft palate
(see 241850). Unlike previous cases, these patients had an incomplete
clinical phenotype, lacking choanal atresia and bifid epiglottis. They
were homozygous for a 169G-A transition, which was predicted to result
in a ser57-to-asn (S57N) substitution in the forkhead DNA binding domain
of FOXE1. The mutant protein showed impaired DNA binding and partial
loss of transcriptional function.

.0003
HYPOTHYROIDISM, THYROIDAL, WITH SPIKY HAIR AND CLEFT PALATE

Baris et al. (2006) reported a female child with Bamforth-Lazarus
syndrome (241850) who presented with congenital hypothroidism, bilateral
choanal atresia, cleft palate, and spiky hair but who was not
athyreotic. Thyroid ultrasonography and computed tomography examination
indicated thyroid tissue in a eutopic location, although biochemical
measurements and radioisotope scanning showed that it was nonfunctional.
The child was homozygous for a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 304 that
resulted in an arginine-to-cysteine mutation at codon 102 (R102C), a
highly conserved residue within the forkhead DNA-binding domain of
FOXE1. Her consanguineous Turkish parents were unaffected heterozygotes,
and the mutation was not detected in 100 control chromosomes. Consonant
with its location, the R102C mutant FOXE1 protein showed loss of DNA
binding and was transcriptionally inactive.

608085	TITLE *608085 GTPase, IMAP FAMILY, MEMBER 2; GIMAP2
;;IMMUNITY-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; IMAP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a sequence database using IMAP1 (608084) as probe, Stamm et
al. (2002) identified IMAP2. The deduced 337-amino acid protein contains
5 motifs conserved in GTP-binding proteins and a putative C-terminal
transmembrane region. IMAP2 shares 43% amino acid identity with IMAP1
(608084).

GENE STRUCTURE

Stamm et al. (2002) determined that the IMAP1 gene contains 3 exons.
Exon 1 is untranslated, and exon 3 contains more than 94% of the coding
sequence.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Stamm et al. (2002) mapped the IMAP2 gene
to a 100-kb IMAP gene cluster on chromosome 7q32-q36. Within this
cluster, IMAP1 is located on the negative strand, while IMAP2, IMAP3
(IAN4L1; 608086), and IMAP4 (608087) are on the opposite positive
strand.

607003	TITLE *607003 THYMIC STROMAL LYMPHOPOIETIN; TSLP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Several cytokines, including interleukin-7 (IL7; 146660), play a key
role in the development of B lymphocytes. TSLP is a member of this
family of B cell-stimulating factors.

CLONING

By EST and genomic database screening for sequences similar to IL7,
followed by screening a lung fibroblast sarcoma cDNA library, Reche et
al. (2001) obtained a cDNA encoding TSLP. The deduced 159-amino acid
protein, which is only 43% identical to mouse Tslp, contains a
28-residue signal sequence, 6 cysteines, and 2 N-glycosylation sites.
SDS-PAGE analysis showed expression of a 23-kD protein, larger than the
predicted 15 kD, suggesting that TSLP is glycosylated. PCR analysis of a
panel of cDNA libraries and cultured cell lines indicated that
expression of a 1.3-kb TSLP transcript may be restricted to a few lung
libraries. Reche et al. (2001) also identified TSLP receptor, which is
composed of TSLPR (CRLF2; 300357) and IL7R (146661) subunits. Dendritic
cells (DCs) and monocytes coexpress IL7R and TSLPR.

Quentmeier et al. (2001) also cloned and characterized TSLP. They noted
the presence of 7 basic C-terminal amino acids (KKRRKRK) in the protein
and that 6 of the 7 cysteines in the mouse protein (those involved in
disulfide bond formation) are conserved in human, whereas the sites for
N-glycosylation are distinct. Northern blot analysis revealed wide
expression of an approximately 1.1-kb transcript, with highest levels in
heart, liver, testis, and prostate.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Quentmeier et al. (2001) mapped the
TSLP gene to chromosome 5 in a region showing homology of synteny to
mouse chromosome 18, where the mouse Tslp gene is localized.

GENE FUNCTION

Reche et al. (2001) showed that incubation of DCs or monocytes with TSLP
enhanced the expression of CCL17 (601520), CCL18 (603757), CCL22
(602957), and CCL19 (602227). IL7, on the other hand, induced expression
of CCL17, CCL22, and CCL19, but also CXCL8 (146930), CXCL7 (121010),
CXCL5 (600324), CXCL1 (155730), CXCL2 (139110), and CXCL3 (139111).
Functional analysis indicated that TSLP enhances the DC maturation
process, as evidenced by upregulation of DC markers and costimulatory
molecules and stronger T-cell proliferation.

By screening myeloid cell lines, Quentmeier et al. (2001) established
that an acute myeloid leukemia line, MUTZ-3, responds by proliferating
in response to TSLP. TSLP also inhibited apoptosis in these cells.
Proliferation in response to TSLP could not be attributed to the
production of other growth factors tested and could be inhibited by
relatively high concentrations of anti-IL7R. TSLP, like IL7, stimulated
phosphorylation of STAT5 (601511), but unlike IL7, it did not activate
JAK3 (600173). TSLP did not phosphorylate mitogen-activated protein
kinases (e.g., ERK1; 601795).

By flow cytometric analysis, Soumelis et al. (2002) showed that
TSLP-activated DCs (TSLP-DCs) express higher levels of HLA-DR and DCLAMP
(605883) than do nonactivated or IL7-activated DCs, and that TSLP-DCs
induce marked proliferation and expansion of allogeneic naive CD4
(186940)-positive T cells. Quantitative mRNA screening and ELISA
analysis showed that TSLP-DCs do not produce detectable proinflammatory
cytokines, but do produce high levels of TARC (CCL17) and MDC (CCL22)
chemokines, which preferentially attract CCR4 (604836)-expressing Th2
lymphocytes. TSLP-DCs induced CD4 cells to produce high amounts of IL13
(147683), IL5 (147850), and the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis
factor (TNF; 191160), but only low amounts of IL10 (124092) and
gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570). RT-PCR analysis did not detect TSLP in
most hemopoietic cells, the exception being mast cells. Keratinocytes,
epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and lung fibroblasts also
expressed high levels of TSLP. Within tonsils, highest levels were in
crypt epithelial cells. Soumelis et al. (2002) suggested that TSLP may
contribute to constitutive inflammation in this tissue and sporadic
inflammation in squamous epithelium. Immunohistochemical analysis of
allergic inflammatory tissue showed high expression of TSLP in
keratinocytes of acute and chronic atopic dermatitis lesions, but no
expression in normal skin. Strong TSLP expression in atopic dermatitis
was associated with the disappearance of langerin (604862)-positive
Langerhans cells within the epidermis and the concurrent appearance of
many DCLAMP-activated DCs within the dermis, many of which expressed
langerin. Soumelis et al. (2002) proposed that TSLP expression by
keratinocytes in atopic dermatitis lesions may contribute directly to
the activation of Langerhans cells, which may migrate into the dermis
and then the draining lymph nodes where they can prime allergen-specific
Th2 responses.

Watanabe et al. (2005) reported that human Hassall corpuscles express
TSLP. Human TSLP activates thymic CD11c+ (151510) dendritic cells to
express high levels of CD80 (112203) and CD86 (601020). These
TSLP-conditioned cells are then able to induce the proliferation and
differentiation of CD4+/CD8-(186910)/CD25-(147730) thymic T cells into
CD4+/CD25+/FOXP3+ (300292) regulatory T cells. This induction depends on
peptide-MHC class II interactions and the presence of CD80 and CD86 as
well as IL2 (147680). Immunohistochemistry studies revealed that
CD25+/CTLA4+(123890) regulatory T cells associate in the thymic medulla
with activated or mature dendritic cells and TSLP-expressing Hassall
corpuscles. Watanabe et al. (2005) concluded that Hassall corpuscles
have a critical role in dendritic cell-mediated secondary positive
selection of medium to high affinity self-reactive T cells, leading to
the generation of CD4+/CD25+ regulatory T cells within the thymus.

Siracusa et al. (2011) demonstrated that TSLP promotes systemic
basophilia, that disruption of TSLP-TSLPR interactions results in
defective basophil responses, and that TSLPR-sufficient basophils can
restore TH2-cell-dependent immunity in vivo. TSLP acted directly on bone
marrow-resident progenitors to promote basophil responses selectively.
Critically, TSLP could elicit basophil responses in both IL3
(147740)-IL3R (see 308385)-sufficient and -deficient environments, and
genomewide transcriptional profiling and functional analyses identified
heterogeneity between TSLP-elicited versus IL3-elicited basophils.
Furthermore, activated human basophils expressed TSLPR, and basophils
isolated from eosinophilic esophagitis (see 610247) patients were
distinct from classical basophils. Siracusa et al. (2011) concluded that
collectively, their studies identified previously unrecognized
heterogeneity within the basophil cell lineage and indicated that
expression of TSLP may influence susceptibility to multiple allergic
diseases by regulating basophil hematopoiesis and eliciting a population
of functionally distinct basophils that promote TH2 cytokine-mediated
inflammation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the TSLP
gene and eosinophilic esophagitis, see EOE2 (613412).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using mice deficient in Il7r and/or the common cytokine receptor gamma
chain, Il2rg (308380), Vobhenrich et al. (2003) determined the cytokines
responsible for fetal and perinatal lymphopoiesis in the absence of Il7.
Fetal and perinatal B-cell lymphopoiesis occurred in the bone marrow of
Il2rg -/- mice until 12 weeks of age, but it was absent in Il7r -/- mice
by 4 weeks of age. Lymphopoiesis in Il7r -/- mice was restricted to
fetal liver and was dependent on the presence of Tslp. The residual
lymphopoiesis that occurred in Il7r -/- mice was dependent on Flk2
(136351). Vobhenrich et al. (2003) concluded that TSLP is the main
factor driving IL7-independent fetal and perinatal lymphopoiesis,
although FLK2 is involved.

Using a mouse model of allergic skin inflammation elicited by repeated
epicutaneous (EC) sensitization with ovalbumin (OVA) to tape-stripped
skin, which mimics the scratching-inflicted injury associated with
atopic dermatitis (see 603165), He et al. (2008) found that Tslpr -/-
mice had reduced inflammation, with fewer eosinophils and local Th2
cytokine expression, but unchanged splenocyte secretion of these
cytokines. Addition of Tslp significantly enhanced Th2 cytokine
secretion in vitro by targeting Tlspr on antigen-specific T cells.
Intradermal injection of anti-Tlsp blocked the development of allergic
skin inflammation after EC antigen challenge of OVA-immunized wildtype
mice. He et al. (2008) proposed that TLSP is essential for
antigen-driven Th2 cytokine secretion by skin-infiltrating effector T
cells.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mediator is a multiprotein complex that can function in transcriptional
activation or repression depending on the factors with which it
interacts. The Mediator subunit MED12 has roles in both transcriptional
activation and repression (Ding et al., 2008).

CLONING

Nagase et al. (1996) cloned a cDNA, which they referred to as KIAA0192,
from the human cell line KG-1. They found that the cDNA contains
stretches of CAG (gln) repeats and encodes a 2,124-amino acid protein.

Using a HeLa cell line, Ito et al. (1999) cloned the same gene, TRAP230,
which encodes the 230-kD subunit of the thyroid hormone
receptor-associated protein (TRAP) complex (see 300182). The sequence of
the TRAP230 protein was found in 2 other reports of partial sequences:
CAG H45 (Margolis et al., 1997), and an opposite paired (OPA)-containing
protein called HOPA by Philibert et al. (1998) located on chromosome
Xq13. TRAP230 also contains 2 overlapping ligand-dependent nuclear
hormone receptor signature recognition motifs (LXXLL motifs) near the N
terminus and a highly glutamine-rich C-terminal region that results from
the CAG trinucleotide repeats. Sequence comparisons revealed that
TRAP230 also has significant homology with a hypothetical C. elegans
protein (CEF47A4). This protein has a regional identity of 23% and
similarity of 40% with TRAP230 and also possesses a characteristic
glutamine-rich sequence near the C terminus. Northern blot analysis of
multiple human tissues showed that the TRAP230 gene is ubiquitously
expressed as an approximately 7.6-kb transcript.

By Northern blot analysis of the HOPA gene transcript and its murine
ortholog, Mopa1, Philibert et al. (1999) demonstrated that only 1
transcript is expressed throughout the central nervous system and other
tissues, and that the transcript is highly expressed during early fetal
development. The presence of an OPA (opposite paired) element strongly
suggested that HOPA is under tissue- or developmental-specific control
(Grabowski et al., 1991).

GENE STRUCTURE

Philibert et al. (1999) sequenced the HOPA gene and found that it is 25
kb long and contains 44 exons. A promoter scan analysis demonstrated 2
possible transcription initiation sites without TATA boxes upstream from
the putative translation initiation start site. Risheg et al. (2007)
stated that the MED12 gene comprises 45 exons.

MAPPING

By use of human/rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped
the MED12 gene to the X chromosome.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human embryo cDNA expression library,
Zhou et al. (2002) found that the transcription activation domain of
SOX9 (608160) interacted with the proline-, glutamine-, and leucine-rich
(PQL) domain of TRAP230. In vitro and in vivo assays confirmed that the
proteins interact endogenously and associate with several other TRAP
complex proteins in HeLa cell nuclear lysates. SOX9 and TRAP230
colocalized in nuclei of cultured human embryo chondrocytes. The
isolated PQL domain of TRAP230 acted as a dominant-negative inhibitor of
SOX9 activity.

p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) is a key mediator of p53 (TP53; 191170)-dependent
cell cycle arrest. Donner et al. (2007) found that transcriptional
activity of the p21 promoter in human cell lines varied in response to
distinct p53-activating stimuli. Core Mediator subunits MED1 (PPARBP;
604311) and MED17 (603810) were recruited to the p21 gene regardless of
the p53-activating stimuli used. In contrast, 3 subunits of the CDK
module of Mediator, CDK8 (603184), MED12, and cyclin C (CCNC; 123838),
were recruited following treatment with nutlin-3, a nongenotoxic drug
that activates p53, but not in response to DNA damage induced by
ultraviolet light C.

Ding et al. (2008) showed that MED12 was required for transcriptional
repression of a subset of neuron-specific genes in human nonneuronal
cell lines, and that this repression was independent of CDK8 and CYCC.
Yeast 2-hybrid analysis showed that the C-terminal domain of MED12
interacted directly with the H3K9 histone methyltransferase G9A (EHMT2;
604599). Mutation analysis revealed that the pro-glu-leu (PQL) domain of
MED12 interacted with an ankyrin-repeat domain on G9A and, more weakly,
with a cys-rich domain on G9A. Purified HeLa cell Mediator complexes
that included MED12 interacted directly with G9A and REST (600571), a
gene repressor that functions through repressor element-1 (RE1).
Endogenous REST in HEK293 cells suppressed expression of a reporter gene
bearing RE1 sites, and knockdown of either MED12 or G9A abrogated the
suppression. Depletion of MED12 significantly reduced the association of
G9A with RE1 elements and decreased the level of H3K9 dimethylation by
G9A without influencing RE1 site occupancy by REST. Both the MED12
arg961-to-trp (R961W; 300188.0001) mutation associated with
Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome (305450) and the MED12 asn1007-to-ser (N1007S;
300188.0002) mutation associated with Lujan-Fryns syndrome (309520)
compromised recruitment of Mediator to RE1 elements and selectively
interfered with repression of REST target genes. Ding et al. (2008)
concluded that MED12 within the Mediator complex links REST with G9A in
epigenetic silencing of neuronal genes.

A class of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) termed noncoding RNA-activating
(ncRNA-a) functions to activate their neighboring genes using a
cis-mediated mechanism. Lai et al. (2013) reported that the depletion of
the components of the coactivator complex, Mediator, specifically and
potently diminished the noncoding RNA-induced activation of
transcription in a heterologous reporter assay using human HEK293 cells.
In vivo, Mediator is recruited to ncRNA-a target genes and regulates
their expression. Lai et al. (2013) showed that ncRNA-a interact with
Mediator to regulate its chromatin localization and kinase activity
towards histone H3 serine-10. The Mediator complex harboring
disease-causing MED12 mutations displayed diminished ability to
associate with activating ncRNAs. Chromosome conformation capture
confirmed the presence of DNA looping between the ncRNA-a loci and its
targets. Importantly, depletion of Mediator subunits or ncRNA-a reduced
the chromatin looping between the 2 loci. Lai et al. (2013) concluded
that their results identified the human Mediator complex as the
transducer of activating ncRNAs and highlighted the importance of
Mediator and activating ncRNA association in human disease.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Opitz-Kaveggia Syndrome

Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome (305450), also known as FG syndrome, is an
X-linked disorder characterized by mental retardation, relative
macrocephaly, hypotonia, and constipation. Risheg et al. (2007) reported
that the original family from which the designation FG was derived and 5
other families had a recurrent mutation in the MED12 gene, 2881C-T
(R961W; 300188.0001). MED12 was considered a candidate gene because of
its mapping to Xq13 and because it encodes a thyroid hormone
receptor-associated protein (TRAP). Risheg et al. (2007) sequenced the
45 exons of MED12 in 24 index cases from XLMR families with linkage to
Xq13. Two of the 24 index cases had the identical R961W missense
mutation. In both of these individuals, the diagnosis of Opitz-Kaveggia
syndrome had been made a priori. In all affected males who survived long
enough for mental or cognitive assessment, mental retardation was
present. Partial or complete absence of the corpus callosum was noted in
all 6 cases in which brain imaging was available. High, prominent
forehead and small, low-set, simple ears were the most consistent
craniofacial manifestations. Imperforate anus, wide flat thumbs, and
wide great toes were present in 7 of 10 cases. Cryptorchidism, inguinal
hernia, cardiac defects, and short stature were noted in fewer than half
of affected males. Risheg et al. (2007) proposed that the Opitz-Kaveggia
syndrome designation be reserved for those individuals with MED12
mutations.

- Lujan-Fryns Syndrome

In 4 affected members of a family with Lujan-Fryns syndrome (309520)
originally reported by Lujan et al. (1984), Schwartz et al. (2007)
identified a mutation in the MED12 gene (300188.0002). The same mutation
was found in affected members of an unrelated family. The findings
indicated that Lujan-Fryns syndrome and Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome are
allelic disorders. Clinically, Lujan-Fryns syndrome could be
distinguished by tall stature, hypernasal voice, hyperextensible digits,
and high nasal root. Schwartz et al. (2007) suggested that the
Lujan-Fryns syndrome designation be used only for those cases with a
compatible clinical phenotype and mutations in the MED12 gene.

- Ohdo Syndrome, X-linked

Vulto-van Silfhout et al. (2013) performed exome sequencing in 2
families segregating X-linked Ohdo syndrome (OHDOX; 300895), including
the family originally studied by Maat-Kievit et al. (1993) and another
family with 2 affected males, and identified hemizygous missense
mutations in the MED12 gene (R1148H, 300188.0003 and S1165P,
300188.0004) that segregated with the disorder in each family. By
analysis of an additional cohort of 9 simplex male patients with Ohdo
syndrome, they identified another MED12 missense mutation (H1729N;
300188.0005) in 1 patient.

Vulto-van Silfhout et al. (2013) comparatively examined siRNA-resistant
wildtype FLAG-tagged MED12 (FLAG-MED12) and its corresponding R1148H and
S1165P mutant derivatives for their respective abilities to suppress
enhanced REST target gene expression triggered by RNAi-mediated
depletion of endogenous MED12 in HEK293 cells. MED12 knockdown triggered
derepression of REST target genes, including CHRM4 (118495), SNAP25
(600322), and SYN1 (313440). Introduction of wildtype FLAG-MED12 in
these cells reversed this effect; in contrast, the R1148H and S1165P
mutants were significantly compromised in this ability. Vulto-van
Silfhout et al. (2013) also showed that neither amino acid change
deleteriously affected the incorporation of MED12 into Mediator or its
direct interaction with G9A, indicating that the MED12 mutations in Ohdo
syndrome do not disrupt the function of MED12 as a stable G9A interface
in Mediator.

- Susceptibility to Mental Retardation

Philibert et al. (1998) reported a strong association of a variant
polymorphism, a 12-bp duplication (CAGCAACACCAG), in the HOPA gene with
an X-linked mental retardation/hypothyroidism syndrome in several
independent cohorts.

Friez et al. (2000) concluded that the 12-bp duplication in the HOPA
gene is not associated with mental retardation. They determined the
incidence of the dodecamer duplication in cohorts of non-fragile X males
with mental retardation from 3 countries, cohorts of fragile X males
from 2 countries, 43 probands from families with X-linked mental
retardation, and control cohorts from 3 countries. The duplication was
found in 3.6 to 4.0% of male patients from 2 non-fragile X groups, in
1.2% from another non-fragile X group, but in no male patients from
families with X-linked mental retardation. The dodecamer duplication was
also found in several white males with fragile X syndrome from France
(5%) and South Africa (22.2%). Additionally, the duplication was found
in 1.5% of South Carolinian newborn males, 2.5% of South Carolinian male
college students, 5% of Italian male controls, and 4.5% of white South
African controls. The duplication appeared to be rare in the black South
African population. The incidence of the duplication was not
significantly different between any of the groups in the study.

A study by Beyer et al. (2002) also failed to sustain the hypothesis
that the HOPA gene is a significant susceptibility factor for infantile
autism and mental retardation. The 12-bp duplication in the HOPA gene
appeared to function as a benign polymorphism.

- Uterine Leiomyoma

Makinen et al. (2011) performed whole-exome sequencing on 18 uterine
leiomyomas derived from 17 different patients and identified
tumor-specific mutations in the MED12 gene in 10. Analysis of 207
additional tumors identified MED12 mutations in 70% (159/225) of tumors
from a total of 80 patients. The Mediator complex is a 26-subunit
transcriptional regulator that bridges DNA regulatory sequences to the
RNA polymerase II initiation complex. All mutations identified by
Makinen et al. (2011) resided in exon 2, suggesting that aberrant
function of this region of MED12 contributes to tumorigenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hong et al. (2005) showed that med12-deficient zebrafish embryos showed
defects in brain, neural crest, and kidney development and do not
survive beyond 1 week after fertilization. Rau et al. (2006) showed,
also in zebrafish, that med12 is required as a coactivator of Sox9
(608160)-dependent neural crest, cartilage, and ear development.
Mutations in med12 are responsible for the zebrafish mutant 'motionless'
(mot), and med12 transcripts are enriched in brain, where the gene is
responsible for regulating the expression of other neuronal
determination genes (Wang et al., 2006). These and other studies
suggested that a variety of signaling pathways interact with MED12.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OPITZ-KAVEGGIA SYNDROME
MED12, ARG961TRP

In the original family with what was designated the FG syndrome (305450)
after the family initials, Risheg et al. (2007) found a 2881C-T
transition in exon 21 of the MED12 gene that caused an arg961-to-trp
amino acid substitution (R961W). They also found the same mutation in 5
other families. Failure to find the change in 451 normal men and in 343
consecutive newborn males suggested that it is not a rare polymorphic
variant. The finding of the mutation in patients of various ethnic
backgrounds suggested that families did not share a common ancestor.

Ding et al. (2008) showed that both the R961W mutation associated with
Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome and the MED12 asn1007-to-ser (N1007S;
300188.0002) mutation associated with Lujan-Fryns syndrome (309520)
compromised recruitment of Mediator to RE1 elements and selectively
interfered with repression of REST (600571) target genes. The authors
noted that these mutations do not alter the ability of MED12 to support
beta-catenin (see CTNNB1; 116806) transactivation.

.0002
LUJAN-FRYNS SYNDROME
MED12, ASN1007SER

In 4 affected members of a family with Lujan-Fryns syndrome (309520)
originally reported by Lujan et al. (1984), Schwartz et al. (2007)
identified a 3020A-G transition in exon 22 of the MED12 gene, resulting
in an asn1007-to-ser (N1007S) substitution. Affected members of an
unrelated family carried the same mutation.

Ding et al. (2008) showed that both the N1007S mutation associated with
Lujan-Fryns syndrome and the MED12 arg961-to-trp (R961W; 300188.0001)
mutation associated with Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome (305450) compromised
recruitment of Mediator to RE1 elements and selectively interfered with
repression of REST (600571) target genes. The authors noted that these
mutations do not alter the ability of MED12 to support beta-catenin (see
CTNNB1; 116806) transactivation.

.0003
OHDO SYNDROME, X-LINKED
MED12, ARG1148HIS

By exome sequencing in a family in which 2 males had Ohdo syndrome
(OHDOX; 300895), originally described by Maat-Kievit et al. (1993) and
Verloes et al. (2006), Vulto-van Silfhout et al. (2013) identified a
hemizygous c.3443G-A transition in the MED12 gene, resulting in an
arg1148-to-his (R1148H) substitution, that segregated with the
phenotype. Arg1148 is a highly conserved residue, and the mutation was
predicted to be damaging to protein function.

.0004
OHDO SYNDROME, X-LINKED
MED12, SER1165PRO

By exome sequencing in a family in which 2 males had Ohdo syndrome
(OHDOX; 300895), Vulto-van Silfhout et al. (2013) identified a
hemizygous c.3493T-C transition in the MED12 gene, resulting in a
ser1165-to-pro (S1165P) substitution, that segregated with the
phenotype. Ser1165 is a highly conserved residue, and the mutation was
predicted to be damaging to protein function.

.0005
OHDO SYNDROME, X-LINKED
MED12, HIS1729ASN

Vulto-van Silfhout et al. (2013) sequenced the MED12 in a cohort of 9
simplex male individuals with Ohdo syndrome (OHDOX; 300895) and
identified a hemizygous de novo c.5185C-A transversion, resulting in a
his1729-to-asn (H1729N) substitution in the PQL domain. His1729 is a
highly conserved residue, and the mutation was predicted to be damaging
to protein function.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Le Coniat et al. (1992) cloned a cDNA encoding a nuclear 43-kD
glycoprotein, identified as the G hnRNP protein. They designated the
gene HNRPG. The HNRPG cDNA has 60% homology with RBMY1A1.

Mazeyrat et al. (1999) isolated and sequenced 2 Rbmx mouse cDNA clones,
which they named Rbmx1 and Rbmx2, with distinct 3-prime ends. RT-PCR
showed that both Rbmx transcripts are ubiquitously expressed. Mazeyrat
et al. (1999) concluded that, based on the absence of intronic sequence,
the mouse Hnrpg gene is a retroposon derived from Rbmx.

GENE FUNCTION

The genes on the human Y chromosome fall into 2 classes with distinct
evolutionary origins. Widely expressed, single-copy genes with X
homologs that escape inactivation (X-Y shared genes) derive from the
ancient proto X-Y chromosome pair. Testis-specific, multicopy genes with
no X homologs originate from autosomes and have accumulated on a
'selfish Y' because of their male-specific function. Copies of genes in
the RBMY gene family (see RBMY1A1, 400006) are candidate spermatogenesis
genes because they are found in all 3 azoospermia factor (AZF) deletion
intervals on the human Yq, which are associated with oligospermia or
azoospermia (Vogt et al., 1997). An active X-borne homolog of the
Y-borne RBMY gene was demonstrated in humans and marsupials by Delbridge
et al. (1999) and in the mouse by Mazeyrat et al. (1999). Delbridge et
al. (1999) stated that, like other gene pairs on the X and Y chromosomes
(e.g., DFFRX/DFFRY; see 400005), RBMX retained a widespread function and
RBMY evolved a male-specific function in spermatogenesis. Thus, RBMY1A1,
far from belonging to a 'second class' of testis-specific elements, is a
diverged X-Y shared gene.

Venables et al. (2000) used a yeast 2-hybrid system to show that the
RBMY gene product hnRNPG and a novel testis-specific relative (termed
hnRNPG-T) interact with Tra2-beta (TRA2B; 602719), an activator of
pre-mRNA splicing that is ubiquitous but highly expressed in testis. The
RBMY gene product and Tra2-beta colocalized in 2 major domains in human
spermatocyte nuclei. Incubation with the protein interaction domain of
the RBMY gene product inhibited splicing in vitro of a specific pre-mRNA
substrate containing an essential enhancer bound by Tra2-beta. The
RNA-binding domain of RBM affected 5-prime splice site selection. The
authors concluded that the hnRNPG family of proteins is involved in
pre-mRNA splicing and hypothesized that RBM may be involved in
Tra2-beta-dependent splicing in spermatocytes.

Using in vivo splicing assays, Hofmann and Wirth (2002) identified
hnRNPG and its paralog RBM as splicing factors that promoted the
inclusion of SMN2 (601627) exon 7. Both hnRNPG and RBM nonspecifically
bound RNA, but directly and specifically bound Htra2-beta1, an SR-like
splicing factor which stimulates inclusion of exon 7 through a direct
interaction with SMN2 exon 7 pre-mRNA. Using deletion mutants of hnRNPG,
the authors demonstrated a specific protein-protein interaction of
hnRNPG with Htra2-beta1, which mediated the inclusion of SMN2 exon 7
rather than the nonspecific interaction of hnRNPG with SMN pre-mRNA.
These trans-acting splicing factors were also effective on endogenous
SMN2 transcripts and increased the endogenous SMN protein level. The
authors presented a model of how exon 7 mRNA processing may be regulated
by these splicing factors.

Nasim et al. (2003) showed that HNRNPG and the splicing activator
protein TRA2B have opposite effects upon the incorporation of several
exons, and that both are capable of acting as either an activator or a
repressor. HNRNPG acts via a specific sequence to repress the skeletal
muscle-specific exon (SK) of human slow skeletal alpha-tropomyosin
(TPM3; 191030), and stimulates inclusion of the alternative nonmuscle
exon. The binding of HNRNPG to the exon is antagonized by TRA2B. The 2
proteins also have opposite effects upon a dystrophin (300377)
pseudoexon. This exon was incorporated to a higher level in patient
heart muscle than skeletal muscle, causing X-linked dilated
cardiomyopathy. Cotransfection with HNRNPG repressed incorporation in
cardiac myoblasts, whereas TRA2B increased it in skeletal myoblasts. The
authors proposed that the HNRNPG/TRA2B ratio may contribute to cellular
splicing preferences, and that the higher proportion of HNRNPG in
skeletal muscle may play a role in preventing the incorporation of the
pseudoexon and thus in preventing skeletal muscle dystrophy.

MAPPING

Delbridge et al. (1999) mapped the RBMX gene to human Xq26 by FISH. By
PCR analysis of human/mouse hybrid cell lines, Mazeyrat et al. (1999)
demonstrated mapping of the HNRPG-homologous structural gene to the
human X chromosome. By FISH, they mapped the mouse Rbmx gene to XA3-XA5,
a region sharing homology of synteny with human Xq26. Mazeyrat et al.
(1999) localized the Hnrpg retroposon, which they renamed Rbmxrt, to
mouse chromosome 14.

- PSEUDOGENES

Le Coniat et al. (1992) had mapped the HNRPG gene to chromosome 6p12 by
radioactive in situ hybridization. Delbridge et al. (1999) found that
the HNRPG locus on 6p12 represents a processed pseudogene and considered
it likely that this and other intronless copies with nucleotide homology
to the HNRPG cDNA on chromosomes 1, 4, 9, 11, and the X chromosome were
derived by retrotransposition from RBMY-like sequence on the human X
chromosome. They suggested that the erroneous localization of the HNRPG
cDNA probably occurred because of the preferential hybridization of the
cDNA clone to the processed pseudogene on chromosome 6. Delbridge et al.
(1999) proposed that the HNRPG locus be renamed RBMXP1.

205100	TITLE #205100 AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS 2, JUVENILE; ALS2
;;ALS, JUVENILE; ALSJ
DESCRIPTION A number sign (#) is used with this entry because juvenile amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis-2 (ALS2) can be caused by homozygous mutation in the
gene encoding alsin (ALS2; 606352) on chromosome 2q33.

Juvenile primary lateral sclerosis (PLSJ; 606353) and infantile-onset
ascending spastic paralysis (IAHSP; 607225) are allelic disorders with
overlapping phenotypes.

For a phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity
of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), see ALS1 (105400).

CLINICAL FEATURES

In an Amish isolate, Gragg et al. (1971) observed 2 brothers with onset
in the first decade of the ALS symptom complex: distal muscular atrophy,
increased deep tendon reflexes, spasticity, and fasciculations. Refsum
and Skillicon (1954) described the same phenotype in 2 brothers and a
sister, with onset between 3 and 5 years of age. They stated that the
condition was indistinguishable from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS;
105400).

Hentati et al. (1992, 1994) reported a Tunisian family in which 10
members had juvenile-onset ALS with symptoms beginning between ages 3
and 23 years. The disorder was characterized by progressive spasticity
of the limb, facial, and pharyngeal muscles with spastic gait and
spastic dysarthria. Some patients had amyotrophy of the hands and
peroneal muscles. Several patients had uncontrolled laughter and
weeping, consistent with pseudobulbar symptoms. This family had also
been reported in a larger series of affected families by Ben Hamida et
al. (1990).

Kress et al. (2005) reported a Turkish man, born of consanguineous
parents, with juvenile ALS confirmed by mutation in the ALS2 gene
(606352.0011). He had a severe disease course with onset at age 2 years
of difficulty walking, spastic gait, hyperreflexia, and extensor plantar
responses. Spastic tetraparesis and pseudobulbar paralysis developed at
ages 12 and 15 years, respectively. He became wheelchair-bound at age 16
and anarthric at 18. He also had mild distal amyotrophy of the upper and
lower limbs.

Shirakawa et al. (2009) reported 2 Japanese brothers, born of unrelated
parents, with juvenile ALS. The older brother, who was more severely
affected, started walking on tiptoes at age 13 months and had never run.
He developed dysarthria at age 11 years and lost the ability to speak at
14. At age 32, he had lower limb spasticity, extensor plantar responses,
and complete paralysis of the tongue. He had mild signs of lower motor
neuron involvement, with distal muscle atrophy of the limbs, and normal
cognition. The younger brother had a milder disease course, with walking
at age 3 years, but ability to participate in gym during elementary
school. At age 23, he had unintelligible speech, mild muscle atrophy in
the extremities, and normal cognition.

MAPPING

By linkage analysis of a large consanguineous Tunisian family with
juvenile ALS, Hentati et al. (1992) established linkage to chromosome
2q33-q35 (maximum lod score of 7.67 at marker D2S72). Haplotype analysis
indicated a 20- to 25-cM interval between CRYG (123660) and COL3A1
(120180). By further linkage analysis in this family, Hentati et al.
(1994) refined the ALS2 locus to an 8-cM region between D2S115 and
D2S155. By linkage and haplotype analyses, Hosler et al. (1998) refined
the ALS2 locus to a 1.7-cM region. Hadano et al. (1999) assigned the
ALS2 gene to 2q33-q34 by inclusion within a YAC contig.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of the Tunisian family reported by Ben Hamida et al.
(1990) and Hentati et al. (1992, 1994), Yang et al. (2001) and Hadano et
al. (2001) identified a homozygous mutation in the ALS2 gene
(606352.0001).

606293	TITLE *606293 PROTOCADHERIN-GAMMA, SUBFAMILY A, MEMBER 6; PCDHGA6
;;PCDH-GAMMA-A6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules, and
protocadherins constitute a subfamily of nonclassic cadherins. PCDHGA6
is 1 of 22 tandemly arranged genes within the PCDHG gene cluster
(604968) on chromosome 5q31. The 22 PCDHG genes function as 'variable'
exons that are individually spliced to a downstream constant region to
form distinct PCDHG transcripts. The variable PCDHG exons encode the
extracellular and transmembrane domains of the protocadherin protein,
and the common region encodes the intracellular domain (Wu et al.,
2001). For further information on the PCDHG genes, see 604968.

CLONING

By PCR of a brain cDNA library, Wu and Maniatis (1999) cloned
full-length PCDHGA6.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2001) mapped the PCDHGA6 gene
to chromosome 5q31, between the PCDHGB3 gene (606301) and the PCDHGA7
gene (606294). They localized the mouse PCDHG genes to chromosome 18c.

611654	TITLE *611654 CENTROSOME SPINDLE POLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; CSPP1
;;CSPP
CSPP1-S, INCLUDED;;
CSPP1-L, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CSPP1 interacts with centrosomes and microtubules and plays a role in
cell-cycle progression and spindle organization (Patzke et al., 2005;
Patzke et al., 2006).

CLONING

By cDNA representational difference analysis to search for genes
associated with high-grade human non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma, followed
by screening a human testis cDNA library, Patzke et al. (2005) cloned a
partial CSPP1 cDNA, herein termed CSPP1-S. The deduced 876-amino acid
protein is highly charged and has a calculated molecular mass of 101.5
kD. CSPP1 has an N-terminal bipartite nuclear localization signal, a
proline-rich region, a central domain consisting of 3 coiled-coil
regions, and a C-terminal domain. Immunofluorescence studies localized
CSPP1-S along microtubules, accumulating mainly around the centrosome in
transfected interphase HEK293T cells. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected a 4.4-kb transcript in testis.

By database analysis, Patzke et al. (2006) identified a CSPP1 isoform,
which they called CSPP1-L, of 1,221 amino acids and a calculated
molecular mass of 142 kD. CSPP1-L contains an N-terminal addition of 294
amino acids and a 51-amino acid insertion in the coiled-coil domain.
RT-PCR detected CSPP1-L expression at higher levels than CSPP1-S in
human testis and in asynchronously growing HEK293T cells and Reh cells.
Relative expression levels of CSPP1-S and CSPP1-L behaved inversely in
asynchronously growing Reh cells; CSPP1-S expression decreased from G1
to S and G2/M phase, whereas CSPP1-L levels increased throughout the
cell cycle. Immunofluorescence studies localized CSPP1-L to the
microtubules and centrosomes, accumulating at the microtubule
organization center in interphase, similar to CSPP1-S. By nocodazole
exposure, Patzke et al. (2006) showed that both CSPP1-S and CSPP1-L
localized to centrosomes independently of microtubules.

GENE FUNCTION

Patzke et al. (2005) showed that overexpression of CSPP1-S in HEK293T
cells blocked cell-cycle progression in G1 phase and perturbed spindle
formation and chromosome congression in mitosis, displaying multiple
spindle poles and condensed chromosomes aligned in ring-like structures
around the spindle poles. RNAi depletion of CSPP1-S perturbed cell-cycle
progression in late S phase under activation of the DNA replication
checkpoint.

Patzke et al. (2006) showed that overexpression of both CSPP1-S and
CSPP1-L impaired mitotic progression; however, different phenotypes were
associated with each isoform. Cells overexpressing CSPP1-L displayed
frequent bipolar spindles with lagging chromosomes as well as formation
of monopolar spindles. However, overexpression of CSPP1-S caused
multipolar spindles and seldom showed metaphase alignment. Using CSPP1-S
and CSPP1-L mutant constructs, they showed that the 294-amino acid
N-terminal extension was associated with increased multipolar spindles,
decreased numbers of monopolar spindles, and bipolar spindles with
lagging chromosomes. Both CSPP1-S and CSPP1-L-expressing cells impaired
cell-cycle progression in the G1 phase but to different degrees.
C-terminal truncated mutants containing a domain common to both CSPP1-S
and CSPP1-L localized to the centrosomes throughout the cell cycle.

GENE STRUCTURE

Patzke et al. (2006) determined that the CSPP1 gene contains 30 exons.
The CSPP1-S isoform results from alternative splicing of exon 4 and
lacks exon 17. The CSPP1-L isoform contains 29 exons and lacks exon 4.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Patzke et al. (2005) mapped the CSPP1 gene
to chromosome 8q13.2.

614693	TITLE *614693 ATM INTERACTOR; ATMIN
;;ATM SUBSTRATE CHK2-INTERACTING ZINC FINGER PROTEIN; ASCIZ;;
KIAA0431
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATMIN functions in the DNA damage response and in embryonic development
(Jurado et al., 2012).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1997) cloned ATMIN, which they designated
KIAA0431. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its 3-prime
end, and the deduced protein contains 667 amino acids. RT-PCR detected
variable ATMIN expression in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in placenta, lung, and kidney.

Jurado et al. (2012) stated that there are 2 isoforms of ASCIZ that
differ only in their N-terminal ends. The full-length 823-amino acid
ASCIZ isoform contains 4 N-terminal zinc finger motifs, followed by a
central core domain and a C-terminal transcription activation domain
containing multiple SQ/TQ and TQT motifs. It also has several potential
ATM (607585)/ATR (601215) phosphorylation sites. The 667-amino acid
ASCIZ isoform has only 2 N-terminal zinc finger motifs.

GENE FUNCTION

Jurado et al. (2012) found that knockdown of ASCIZ resulted in
significantly reduced expression of DYNLL1 (601562) in mouse, chicken,
and human cells. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis revealed that DYNLL1 bound to
both isoforms of ASCIZ. DYNLL1 bound to each of 10 single TQT motifs
within the transactivation domain of ASCIZ, and DYNLL1 binding inhibited
ASCIZ-dependent transactivation of a reporter gene. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that ASCIZ bound directly to the
human DYNLL1 promoter and regulated its activity in a manner dependent
on the ASCIZ zinc finger domain. However, high DYNLL1 levels inhibited
the transcriptional activity of ASCIZ. DYNLL1 was also required for DNA
damage-induced ASCIZ focus formation. Jurado et al. (2012) concluded
that ASCIZ has the dual ability to activate DYNLL1 gene expression and
to sense free DYNLL1 protein levels, resulting in simple feedback loop
to adjust cellular content of DYNLL1.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the ATMIN
gene to chromosome 16.

Hartz (2012) mapped the ATMIN gene to chromosome 16q23.2 based on an
alignment of the ATMIN sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB007891) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

609024	TITLE *609024 KDEL ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM PROTEIN RETENTION RECEPTOR 2; KDELR2
;;ERD2-LIKE PROTEIN 1; ELP1;;
ERD2.2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Resident soluble proteins within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) are retained there by virtue of a C-terminal tetrapeptide ER
retention signal, commonly lys-asp-glu-leu (KDEL) in mammals. KDELR2 is
one of the receptors that cycle between the Golgi apparatus and the ER,
returning proteins containing the KDEL signal to the ER (Lewis and
Pelham, 1992).

CLONING

By screening cDNA libraries with a KDELR1 (131235) sequence, followed by
5-prime RACE of a Burkitt lymphoma cell line cDNA library, Lewis and
Pelham (1992) cloned KDELR2, which they designated ERD2.2. The deduced
212-amino acid protein contains 7 transmembrane domains and shares 83.5%
identity with KDELR1, with most differences between the 2 receptors in
the transmembrane spans.

Using degenerate PCR primers designed from a conserved region of KDELR1
to amplify related cDNAs from an erythroleukemia cell line cDNA library,
followed by screening a T-cell cDNA library, Hsu et al. (1992) cloned
KDELR2, which they called ELP1. The deduced 214-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 24.6 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a
KDELR2 transcript of about 1.2 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Lewis and Pelham (1992) observed that KDELR2 transfected into COS-7
cells accumulated predominantly in the Golgi complex, but when the
receptor was coexpressed with a target protein containing the KDEL ER
retention signal, it redistributed to the ER, mirroring the behavior of
KDELR1 under the same conditions.

Hsu et al. (1992) found that about half of KDELR1- or KDELR2-transfected
COS cells expressed the receptors in a juxtanuclear, Golgi-like pattern,
while the remainder showed a reticular, ER-like pattern with nuclear
envelope staining. Overexpression of the KDEL receptors led to the
ER-like pattern and was associated with the collapse of the Golgi
apparatus into the ER, as seen in cells treated with brefeldin A. In
addition to the loss of the Golgi apparatus as a distinct organelle,
overexpression resulted in redistribution of the Golgi coat protein,
beta-COP (COPB; 600959), to the cytosol, addition of complex
oligosaccharides to resident ER glycoproteins, and blockage of
anterograde traffic. Hsu et al. (1992) concluded that the KDEL receptors
provide signals that regulate retrograde traffic between the Golgi and
the ER.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the KDELR2
gene to chromosome 7 (TMAP SHGC-55953).

609948	TITLE *609948 RING FINGER PROTEIN 216; RNF216
;;TRIAD DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 3; TRIAD3;;
ZINC FINGER PROTEIN INHIBITING NFKB; ZIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRIAD proteins, such as TRIAD3, contain 2 RING fingers flanking a
conserved cysteine-rich (C6HC) zinc-binding domain called a double RING
finger-linked (DRIL) domain. Like other RING finger proteins, TRIADs
interact with a variety of proteins (van der Reijden et al., 1999).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a B-cell cDNA library using RIP (RIPK1;
603453) as bait, followed by database searching and 5-prime RACE, Chen
et al. (2002) cloned TRIAD3, which they called ZIN. The predicted
488-amino acid protein contains 4 central RING-like domains (RLDs) and a
C-terminal proline-rich domain. Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous expression of 3.0- and 6.0-kb transcripts, with highest
levels in peripheral blood leukocytes and testis. Western blot analysis
showed a 56-kD protein in several human cell lines. Immunofluorescence
microscopy suggested a cytoplasmic localization for ZIN, like that of
RIP.

By yeast-2 hybrid screening of a human leukocyte cDNA library using the
cytoplasmic TIR domain of TLR9 (605474) as bait, followed by database
analysis and screening a placenta cDNA library, Chuang and Ulevitch
(2004) cloned 5 splice variants of TRIAD3 that they designated TRIAD3A
to TRIAD3E. TRIAD3A and TRIAD3B encode predicted proteins of 866 and 923
amino acids, respectively. TRIAD3C, TRIAD3D, and TRIAD3E encode
identical proteins of 489 amino acids. All TRIAD3 isoforms contain a
C-terminal TRIAD domain and differ in their N-terminal halves. RT-PCR
analysis showed that TRIAD3A was the most abundant form and was
expressed widely in cell lines and tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chuang and Ulevitch (2004) determined that the TRIAD3 gene contains 17
exons and spans about 160 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chuang and Ulevitch (2004) mapped the
RNF216 gene to chromosome 7p22.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation experiments and mutation analysis, Chen et
al. (2002) found that interaction of ZIN and RIP required the RLDs of
ZIN. Luciferase and Western blot analysis showed that ZIN inhibited
RIP-, IKKB (IKBKB; 603258)-, TNF (191160)-, and IL1 (see 147720)-induced
NFKB (see 164011) activation in an RLD-dependent manner. ZIN also
potentiated RIP-induced apoptosis. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments
showed that ZIN did not compete with TRAF2 (601895) for interaction with
RIP.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Chuang and Ulevitch (2004) found that
TRIAD3 interacted with the cytoplasmic domains of TLR3 (603029), TLR4
(603030), TLR5 (603031), and TLR9, but not with that of TLR2 (603028).
Immunoblot analysis showed that expression of TRIAD3A with ubiquitin
(see 191339) resulted in TRIAD3A autoubiquitination and promoted
ubiquitination of TLR9 by acting through UBCH7 (UBE2L3; 603721). TRIAD3A
overexpression caused nearly complete degradation of TLR4 and TLR9
protein, but not TLR2 protein, while its effects on TLR3 and TLR5 were
smaller. The TRIAD3A-induced reduction in TLR protein expression was
paralleled by reductions in signal-specific activation for TLRs, as
shown by RT-PCR and small interfering RNA analyses. Chuang and Ulevitch
(2004) concluded that TRIAD3A is an intracellular protein that regulates
TLR expression and limits the potentially harmful effects that occur
after TLR activation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a 7-generation consanguineous Palestinian family with cerebellar
ataxia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CAHH; 212840), Margolin et al.
(2013) performed exome sequencing and identified homozygosity for 2
missense mutations in 2 different genes, RNF216 (R751C; 609948.0001) and
OTUD4 (G333V; 611744.0001), that segregated with disease in the family.
Sequencing both genes in 9 more patients revealed no further mutations
in the OTUD4 gene, although 1 proband was compound heterozygous for
mutations in RNF216 (609948.0002 and 609948.0003). In addition, several
patients carried heterozygous mutations in RNF216 that were also
detected in unaffected parents and sibs. Margolin et al. (2013)
suggested that the most parsimonious explanation for the observed
patterns in these patients would be oligogenic inheritance.

ANIMAL MODEL

Margolin et al. (2013) injected splice-blocking morpholino
oligonucleotides against the zebrafish genes rnf216 or odud4 (611744)
and observed defects in the eye, optic tetum, and cerebellum.
Combinatorial suppression of both genes exacerbated these phenotypes,
which were rescued by wildtype but not mutant human RNF216 or OTUD4
messenger RNA.

CEREBELLAR ATAXIA AND HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM
RNF216, ARG751CYS

In 3 affected sibs from a 7-generation consanguineous Palestinian family
with cerebellar ataxia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CAHH; 212840),
originally reported by Seminara et al. (2002), Margolin et al. (2013)
identified homozygosity for 2 missense mutations in 2 genes: a c.2251C-T
transition in the RNF216 gene, resulting in an arg751-to-cys (R751C)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the second RING domain,
and a missense mutation in the OTUD4 gene (G333V; 611744.0001). The
mutations segregated with disease in the family and neither was found in
672 Middle Eastern control chromosomes, including 36 Palestinian
chromosomes; furthermore, the RNF216 R751C mutation was not found in
13,006 chromosomes from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, although the
OTUD4 G333V variant was detected in 2 of those chromosomes. The
phenotype of mutant zebrafish injected with splice-blocking morpholino
oligonucleotides against rnf216 could be rescued by wildtype but not
mutant RNF216 mRNA, suggesting that the R751C mutation affects protein
function. The 3 sibs had prominent cerebellar and mild cortical atrophy
with hypodensities in the cerebral white matter on CT scan, and all died
in the fifth decade of life after the development of dementia, 2 from
aspiration pneumonia and 1 from possible pulmonary embolism.
Neuropathologic examination of the brain of 1 sib revealed neuronal loss
in cerebellar pathways and the hippocampus; surviving hippocampal
neurons contained ubiquitin-immunoreactive intranuclear inclusions.

CEREBELLAR ATAXIA AND HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM
RNF216, CYS597TER

In a Caucasian man with cerebellar ataxia and hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (212840), who developed dementia at 22 years of age and
died at age 36, Margolin et al. (2013) identified compound
heterozygosity for a c.1791T-A transversion in the RNF216 gene,
resulting in a cys597-to-ter (C597X) substitution in the first RING
finger domain, and a 2-bp deletion (c.615_616delGA; 609948.0003),
causing a frameshift predicted to result in a premature termination
codon (glu505aspfsX15). The patient's unaffected parents were each
heterozygous for 1 of the mutations, neither of which was found in
13,006 chromosomes from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project.

604657	TITLE *604657 TRANSMEMBRANE 4 SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 5; TM4SF5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

See TM4SF6 (300191) for general information on members of the
transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF).

CLONING

By screening for genes differentially expressed in pancreatic tumors and
normal pancreatic tissue, Gress et al. (1996) identified TM4SF5, a gene
that was highly overexpressed in pancreatic cancer. Muller-Pillasch et
al. (1998) isolated a cDNA representing a full-length TM4SF5 coding
sequence. The predicted 197-amino acid TM4SF5 protein contains 4
transmembrane domains, with a large extracellular domain containing 2
potential N-glycosylation sites located between transmembrane domains 3
and 4. Like other TM4SF proteins, TM4SF5 is cysteine-rich. TM4SF5 shares
50% amino acid identity with the tumor-associated antigen L6 (TM4SF1;
191155). Northern blot analysis of various normal human tissues, namely
intestine, pancreas, stomach, colon, esophagus, bladder, uterus,
placenta, and adipose tissue, detected TM4SF5 expression only in
intestine and 1 of 14 pancreas samples. TM4SF5 was overexpressed in 13
of 14 pancreatic adenocarcinomas, as compared with both normal
pancreatic and chronic pancreatitis tissues. TM4SF5 expression was also
found in 2 of 2 gastric cancers, 1 of 2 colon carcinomas, 1 of 1
carcinoma of the papilla vateri, and 1 of 1 soft-tissue sarcoma. TM4SF5
was expressed as an approximately 1-kb transcript in the pancreatic
tumors.

The POMC gene (176830) is occasionally expressed in nonpituitary tumors
leading to Cushing syndrome (219080). Bronchial carcinoid tumors, one of
the most frequent sources for ectopic ACTH secretion, often display
numerous features of the corticotroph phenotype. To identify new markers
of corticotroph differentiation in these tumors, Le Tallec et al. (2002)
compared the pattern of POMC expression in ACTH-secreting (ACTH+) and
nonsecreting (ACTH-) bronchial carcinoids by differential
display/RT-PCR. In ACTH+ tumors, beside the expected POMC gene, they
identified cFos and KIAA1775, a large expressed sequence tag encoding a
putative protocadherin-related protein. On the other hand, the
tetraspanin TM4SF5 gene was specifically expressed in ACTH- tumors. The
authors concluded that corticotroph differentiation of bronchial
carcinoid tumors is accompanied by induction and repression of specific
genes.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (2008) found that expression of TM4SF5 was upregulated in
human hepatocarcinomas and that expression in clinical samples and
hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines correlated with enhanced p27(Kip1)
(CDKN1B; 600778) expression and cytosolic stabilization, and morphologic
elongation mediated by RhoA (ARHA; 165390) inactivation. These
TM4SF5-mediated effects resulted in epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) via loss of E-cadherin (CDH1; 192090) expression, leading to
aberrant cell growth, anchorage-independent growth, and tumor formation
in nude mice. Suppressing TM4SF5 or cytosolic p27(Kip1) expression or
reconstituting E-cadherin expression abolished these effects.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid mapping panel, Muller-Pillasch et
al. (1998) mapped the TM4SF5 gene to chromosome 17. They localized the
TM4SF5 gene to 17p13.3 using a radiation hybrid mapping panel.

PROTOCADHERIN J, INCLUDED; PCDHJ, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases using a cadherin (see 192090) motif, Hong et al.
(2004) identified CDHJ and PCDHJ. CDHJ has 25 exons and encodes a
deduced 2,916-amino acid protein containing a long N-terminal ectodomain
with numerous individual cadherin domains, followed by a transmembrane
domain and a C-terminal domain. PCDHJ has 2 exons and encodes a deduced
702-amino acid protein with 5 cadherin domains. PCR analysis detected 2
CDHJ variants in cerebral cortex and testis only. Hartz (2008)
determined that the CDHJ and PCDHJ transcripts use nonoverlapping
5-prime and 3-prime exons of the full-length DCHS2 gene, respectively.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hong et al. (2004) mapped the DCHS2 gene
to chromosome 4q31.3. They mapped the mouse Dchs2 gene to a syntenic
region of mouse chromosome 3.

614518	TITLE *614518 GATA ZINC FINGER DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; GATAD1
;;OCULAR DEVELOPMENT-ASSOCIATED GENE; ODAG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tsuruga et al. (2002) cloned mouse Gatad1, which they called Odag, and
they identified human GATAD1 by database analysis. The deduced mouse and
human proteins contain 266 and 269 amino acids, respectively. Both
proteins have an N-terminal zinc finger, and they share 92% identity.
Northern blot analysis detected expression of a 2.5-kb Gatad1 transcript
in all mouse tissues examined, with highest levels in testis and lung.
RT-PCR of developing mouse eye revealed high Gatad1 expression from
embryonic day 13, the earliest day examined, until postnatal day 6.
Expression was reduced at postnatal day 10 and absent by postnatal day
14. In situ hybridization of mouse eye revealed Gatad1 expression in
lens, ciliary body, retina, sclera, and conjunctiva at postnatal days 2
and 7. Postnatal day-7 retina showed Gatad1 expression in the inner
nuclear layer, outer plexiform layer, and outer nuclear layer. No
expression was observed in retina at postnatal day 14, suggesting that
GATAD1 functions specifically during development.

Using immunohistochemistry in healthy left ventricular tissue, Theis et
al. (2011) demonstrated localization of GATAD1 to the nucleus and
cytoplasm with a homogeneous striated staining pattern.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsuruga et al. (2002) determined that the GATAD1 gene contains 5 coding
exons that span about 9 kb.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the GATAD1 gene to chromosome 7q21.2 based on an
alignment of the GATAD1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK26142) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 affected sibs from a consanguineous family of Norwegian ancestry
segregating autosomal recessive dilated cardiomyopathy mapping to
chromosome 7q21 (CMD2B; 614672), Theis et al. (2011) identified
homozygosity for a missense mutation in the GATAD1 gene (614518.0001).
Screening of GATAD1 in an additional 273 probands with CMD did not
reveal any mutations.

exon 2 of the GATAD1 gene, resulting in a ser102-to-pro (S102P)
substitution at a conserved residue. Their 6 unaffected sibs were either
heterozygous or homozygous for the wildtype GATAD1 allele, and the
mutation was not found in 474 controls of similar ancestry with normal
echocardiograms. Immunohistochemical analysis of cardiac biopsy tissue
from the proband revealed a marked disturbance in extranuclear
distribution of GATAD1 compared to controls. In addition, myocyte nuclei
in the proband had a unique globular morphology, contrasting with the
elongated spindle shape observed in controls.

102680	TITLE *102680 ADDUCIN 1; ADD1
;;ADDUCIN, ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Adducin is a 200-kD heterodimeric protein associated with the
erythrocyte membrane skeleton, which binds to Ca(2+)/calmodulin (see
114180), promotes binding of spectrin to actin, and is a substrate for
protein kinases C and A (Gardner and Bennett, 1986; Bennett et al.,
1988). The name adducin comes from the Latin 'adducere,' meaning 'to
bring together.'

CLONING

Adducin was first purified from human erythrocytes by Gardner and
Bennett (1986) and subsequently isolated from bovine brain membranes
(Bennett et al., 1988).

Joshi and Bennett (1990) investigated the structure and function of the
separate domains of alpha adducin. Joshi et al. (1991) isolated
reticulocyte cDNAs for alpha- and beta- (ADD2; 102681) adducin. The
deduced alpha-adducin protein contains 737 amino acids and shares
approximately 49% sequence identity with beta adducin, suggesting
evolution by gene duplication. Each adducin subunit has 3 distinct
domains: a 39-kD N-terminal globular protease-resistant domain,
connected by a 9-kD domain to a 33-kD C-terminal protease-sensitive tail
comprised almost entirely by hydrophilic amino acids. The head domains
of both alpha- and beta-adducin have limited sequence similarity with
the N-terminal actin-binding motif present in members of the spectrin
superfamily and actin gelation proteins. The C termini of both proteins
contain an identical 22-amino acid sequence showing similarity to the
MARCKS protein (177061). Northern blot analysis of rat tissues, K562
erythroleukemia cells, and reticulocytes demonstrated ubiquitous
expression of alpha adducin.

Goldberg et al. (1992) identified a 4-kb alpha-adducin transcript that
was abundantly expressed in the caudate nucleus, the site of major
neuronal loss in Huntington disease (HD; 143100). No sequence
alterations specific to HD were discovered in sequencing the brain
alpha-adducin cDNA from 2 HD patients and an age-matched control. Brain
cDNA from both patients and controls showed 2 alternately spliced brain
exons not previously described in erythrocyte cDNA.

In a comprehensive assay of gene expression, Gilligan et al. (1999)
showed the ubiquitous expression of alpha- and gamma-adducin (ADD3;
601568), in contrast to the restricted expression of beta-adducin.
Beta-adducin was expressed at high levels in brain and hematopoietic
tissues (bone marrow in humans, spleen in mice).

See Gilligan and Bennett (1993) for a review of adducin and the other
components of the junctional complex of the cell membrane skeleton.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Joshi et al. (1991) provisionally
assigned the ADD1 gene to chromosome 4 and the ADD2 gene to chromosome
2. Both alpha- and beta-adducin show alternative splicing; thus, there
may be several different heterodimeric or homodimeric forms of adducin,
each with a different functional specificity.

Using the technique of 'exon trapping' devised by Buckler et al. (1991),
Taylor et al. (1992) identified exons corresponding to the alpha subunit
of adducin within the 4p16.3 region where Huntington disease appeared to
be located. They mapped the ADD1 gene immediately telomeric to D4S95.

Goldberg et al. (1992) reported the isolation and cloning of cDNA for
the brain alpha-adducin gene, which they found to be located within 20
kb of D4S95.

Nasir et al. (1994) used an interspecific backcross to map the mouse
Add1 gene to chromosome 5, within the region of syntenic homology with
the short arm of human chromosome 4. Grosson et al. (1994) also mapped
the mouse Add1 gene to chromosome 5 in a continuous linkage group that
included the Huntington disease homolog.

GENE FUNCTION

Kuhlman et al. (1996) found that purified human erythrocyte adducin
completely blocked elongation and depolymerization at the fast-growing
barbed ends of actin filaments in vitro, thus functioning as a barbed
end capping protein. This barbed end capping activity required the
intact adducin molecule and was downregulated by calmodulin in the
presence of calcium. Kuhlman et al. (1996) concluded that adducin
restricts actin filament length in erythrocytes.

To investigate the molecular involvement of alpha-adducin in controlling
Na/K pump activity, Torielli et al. (2008) transfected wildtype or
mutated rat and human ADD1 into several renal cell lines and
demonstrated that the rat and human mutated forms increased Na/K pump
activity and the number of pump units; both variants
coimmunoprecipitated with the Na/K pump. The increased pump activity was
not due to changes in its basolateral location, but to an alteration of
Na/K pump residential time on the plasma membrane. Both the rat and
human mutated variants reduced constitutive Na/K pump endocytosis and
similarly affected transferrin receptor (190010) trafficking and
fluid-phase endocytosis. Alpha-adducin was also detected in clathrin
(see 118955)-coated vesicles and coimmunoprecipitated with clathrin.
Torielli et al. (2008) suggested that adducin, in addition to having
modulatory effects on actin cytoskeleton dynamics, might play a direct
role in clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and that the constitutive
reduction of Na/K pump endocytic rate induced by mutated adducin
variants might be relevant in sodium-dependent hypertension (see
145500).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a case-control study involving 190 patients with primary hypertension
and 126 controls, Casari et al. (1995) found an association between
essential hypertension (see 145500) and allelic markers near the
alpha-adducin locus.

Cusi et al. (1997) found significant linkage of the alpha-adducin locus
to essential hypertension and greater sensitivity to changes in sodium
balance among patients with a particular ADD1 allele, trp460
(102680.0001), suggesting that alpha adducin is associated with a
salt-sensitive form of essential hypertension.

Manunta et al. (1998) analyzed the pressure-natriuresis relationship in
108 hypertensive individuals and found that patients with a G/W or W/W
ADD1 genotype showed lower plasma renin activity and fractional
excretion of sodium as well as reduced slope of the pressure-natriuresis
relationship after sodium depletion or sodium loading compared to G/G
patients. These findings supported the hypothesis that individuals with
at least 1 ADD1 460W allele have increased renal tubular sodium
reabsorption.

Using endogenous lithium and uric acid as markers of proximal tubular
sodium reabsorption, Manunta et al. (1999) investigated the relationship
between renal sodium handling and ADD1 polymorphism in untreated
hypertensive patients and found that adducin genotype was significantly
and directly related to the fractional excretion of lithium. Manunta et
al. (1999) concluded that ADD1 represents a 'renal hypertensive gene'
that modulates the capacity of tubular epithelial cells to transport
sodium and thus affects blood pressure levels.

Allayee et al. (2001) performed a genomewide scan for blood pressure in
18 Dutch families exhibiting the common lipid disorder familial combined
hyperlipidemia (144250). They found a locus on chromosome 4 that
exhibited a significant lod score of 3.9 for systolic blood pressure. In
addition, this locus appeared to influence plasma free fatty acid levels
(lod = 2.4). After adjustment for age and gender, the lod score for
systolic blood pressure increased to 4.6, whereas the lod score for free
fatty acid levels did not change. Allayee et al. (2001) tested for an
association between 2 intragenic ADD1 polymorphisms and systolic blood
pressure in this sample and found none.

Lanzani et al. (2005) examined the association between polymorphisms in
the ADD1, ADD2, and ADD3 genes (G460W, C1797T, and IVS11+386A-G,
respectively) and ambulatory blood pressure and plasma levels of renin
activity and endogenous ouabain in 512 newly discovered and
never-treated hypertensive patients. Relative to carriers of the
wildtype (G/G) ADD1 gene, carriers of the mutant 460W allele had higher
blood pressure and lower plasma renin activity and endogenous ouabain
levels. Polymorphisms in the ADD2 and ADD3 genes taken alone were not
associated with these variables, but the blood pressure difference
between the 2 ADD1 genotypes was greatest in carriers of the ADD3 G
allele (increased by approximately 8 mm Hg; p = 0.020 to 0.006,
depending on the genetic model applied). The authors suggested that
there were epistatic effects between the ADD1 and ADD3 loci affecting
variation in blood pressure.

ANIMAL MODEL

The Milan hypertensive strain of rats develops a genetic form of renal
hypertension that, when compared to its normotensive control, shows
renal dysfunction similar to that of a subset of human patients with
primary hypertension. Bianchi et al. (1994) showed that 1 point mutation
in each of the 2 genes coding for adducin is associated with blood
pressure level in this strain of rats. The hypertensive and normal rats
differed, respectively, by the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine at
position 316 of the alpha subunit; at the beta-adducin locus, the
hypertensive strain was always homozygous for arginine at position 529,
while the normal strain showed either arginine or glutamine in that
position. The arg/gln heterozygotes showed lower blood pressure than any
of the homozygotes. In vitro phosphorylation studies suggested that both
of these amino acid substitutions occurred within protein kinase
recognition sites. Analysis of an F2 generation demonstrated that Y
(tyrosine) alleles segregated with a significant increment in blood
pressure. This effect was modulated by the presence of the R (arginine)
allele of the beta subunit. Bianchi et al. (1994) stated that, taken
together, these findings strongly supported a role for adducin
polymorphisms in causing variation of blood pressure in the Milan strain
of rats. In the rat, the beta- and alpha-adducin genes were said to be
located on chromosomes 4 and 14, respectively.

Tripodi et al. (1996) studied the effects of the Milan hypertensive rat
316Y and 529R mutations in Add1 and Add2, respectively, on actin
polymerization and bundling in a cell-free system and found that
double-mutated adducin exerted only a slight inhibitory effect with a
much higher final extent of polymerization compared to wildtype. Adducin
heterodimer mutated only in the beta subunit behaved as normal adducin,
whereas adducin heterodimer mutated only in the alpha subunit exhibited
an intermediate phenotype, consistent with the associated levels of
blood pressure previously described by Bianchi et al. (1994). Studies of
the actin cytoskeleton in transfected rat kidney epithelial cell lines
showed that cells overexpressing the mutated alpha-adducin chain
exhibited larger microfilament bundles and larger focal contacts with
patchy aggregates of alpha-v integrin (193210), compared to cells
overexpressing wildtype adducin, in which the microfilament bundles were
organized in a much looser texture and alpha-v integrin was present in a
diffuse punctate pattern with small focal contacts. The surface
expression of the Na-K pump alpha subunit was considerably increased in
cells overexpressing the mutated alpha-adducin chain, and Na-K pump
activity at V(max) was increased with respect to normal transfected
lines and untransfected cells. Tripodi et al. (1996) suggested that
adducin has a role in the constitutive capacity of the renal epithelia
both to transport ions and to expose adhesion molecules.

Efendiev et al. (2004) studied Milan rats carrying the hypertensive
adducin phenotype and observed higher renal tubule Na/K-ATPase activity
and found that their Na/K-ATPase molecules did not undergo endocytosis
in response to dopamine like those of normotensive rats. In the
hypertensive rats, dopamine failed to promote the interaction between
adaptins (see 601026) and the Na/K-ATPase, required for endocytosis,
because of adaptin-mu-2 subunit (602296) hyperphosphorylation.
Expression of the hypertensive rat or human variant of ADD1 into normal
renal epithelial cells recreated the hypertensive phenotype with higher
Na/K-ATPase activity, mu-2-subunit hyperphosphorylation, and impaired
Na/K-ATPase endocytosis. The authors concluded that increased renal
Na/K-ATPase activity and altered sodium reabsorption in certain forms of
hypertension could be attributed to a mutant form of adducin that
impairs the dynamic regulation of renal Na/K-ATPase endocytosis in
response to natriuretic signals.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPERTENSION, SALT-SENSITIVE ESSENTIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
ADD1, GLY460TRP

Cusi et al. (1997) found a significant association between a
gly460-to-trp polymorphism (G460W) in the ADD1 gene and salt sensitivity
in patients with essential hypertension (see 145500). Patients with the
W460 allele showed greater sensitivity to changes in sodium balance, and
heterozygous hypertensive patients (G/W) showed a greater fall in mean
arterial pressure in response to 2 months' treatment with
hydrochlorothiazide, than did wildtype homozygous (G/G) hypertensive
patients. In controls in an Italian cohort, the G460 allele had a
frequency of 86.4% and the W460 allele 13.6%.

Manunta et al. (1998) analyzed the pressure-natriuresis relationship in
108 hypertensive individuals, 80 of whom were wildtype homozygous (G/G),
26 G/W heterozygous, and 2 W/W homozygous. At baseline, the G/W and W/W
patients showed lower plasma renin activity and fractional excretion of
sodium; these patients also had reduced slope of the
pressure-natriuresis relationship after sodium depletion or sodium
loading compared to G/G patients. These findings supported the
hypothesis that individuals with at least 1 ADD1 460W allele have
increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption.

Using endogenous lithium and uric acid as markers of proximal tubular
sodium reabsorption, Manunta et al. (1999) investigated the relationship
between renal sodium handling and ADD1 polymorphism in 54 untreated
hypertensive patients, 29 with the G/G genotype and 25 with the G/W
genotype. Fractional excretions of lithium and uric acid were
significantly decreased in G/W patients compared to G/G patients;
multiple regression analysis showed that adducin genotype was
significantly and directly related to the fractional excretion of
lithium. Manunta et al. (1999) concluded that ADD1 represents a 'renal
hypertensive gene' that modulates the capacity of tubular epithelial
cells to transport sodium and thus affects blood pressure levels.

604751	TITLE *604751 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 266; ZNF266
;;HZF1
DESCRIPTION Zinc finger proteins have been shown to interact with nucleic acids and
to have diverse functions. The zinc finger domain is a conserved amino
acid sequence motif containing 2 specifically positioned cysteines and 2
histidines that are involved in coordinating zinc. Kruppel-related
proteins form 1 family of zinc finger proteins. See ZFP93 (604749) for
additional information on zinc finger proteins.

CLONING

By screening a human monoblast cell line (U-937) cDNA library with a
degenerate oligonucleotide based on a conserved region of
Kruppel-related zinc finger proteins that encompasses the H/C link,
Abrink et al. (1995) isolated cDNAs encoding 42 distinct Kruppel-related
zinc finger proteins, including ZNF266, which they called HZF1. The
partial ZNF266 cDNA, which lacks 5-prime coding sequence, encodes 7
C-terminal zinc finger domains. Northern blot analysis detected a major
4.5-kb ZNF266 transcript in HeLa cells, U-937 cells, and PMA-induced
U-937 cells, with higher expression in the monocyte/macrophage lineages.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ZNF266
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP A008Z15).

603332	TITLE *603332 DYNEIN, AXONEMAL, HEAVY CHAIN 1; DNAH1
;;HL11;;
DNAHC1;;
HDHC7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dyneins are microtubule-associated motor protein complexes composed of
several heavy, light, and intermediate chains. The axonemal dyneins,
found in cilia and flagella, are components of the outer and inner
dynein arms attached to the peripheral microtubule doublets. See 603297.
Chapelin et al. (1997), Neesen et al. (1997), and Vaughan et al. (1996)
isolated partial cDNAs encoding a human dynein heavy chain (DHC) that
they designated DNAHC1, HDHC7, and HL-11, respectively. By sequence
analysis, Chapelin et al. (1997) determined that DNAHC1 belongs to the
putative axonemal inner dynein arm DHC group and is homologous to rat
DLP1. RT-PCR assays indicated that DNAHC1 is expressed primarily in
trachea and testis, 2 tissues containing axonemal structures.

Neesen et al. (1997) cloned partial cDNAs encoding Mdhc7, the mouse
DNAH1 homolog.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Chapelin et al. (1997) mapped the
human DNAHC1 gene to chromosome 3. Using fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Neesen et al. (1997) localized the HDHC7 gene to human
chromosome 3p21.3 and mouse chromosome 14, region B-C. These regions
share homology of synteny. Vaughan et al. (1996) confirmed the map
position of the mouse homolog using an interspecific backcross.

ANIMAL MODEL

Neesen et al. (2001) generated mice lacking the dynein heavy chain-7
(Mdhc7) gene. Both Mdhc7 +/- and Mdhc7 -/- mice were viable and showed
no malformations; however, homozygous males produced no offspring. In
comparison to spermatozoa of Mdhc7 +/- and wildtype mice, those of Mdhc7
-/- mice revealed a dramatically reduced straight line velocity and
progressive movement, resulting in the inability of Mdhc7-deficient
sperm to move from the uterus into the oviduct. Additionally, a
decreased beat frequency in tracheal cilia of 50% was observed in Mdhc7
-/- mice. The reduction in both ciliary and flagellar motility was not
correlated with any gross defects in the axonemal structure. The
phenotype of Mdhc7 -/- mice is similar to that observed in some patients
suffering from primary ciliary dyskinesia (see 244400), and the authors
suggested that mutations in DNAH1 may be responsible for PCD in some
patients.

611589	TITLE *611589 PATATIN-LIKE PHOSPHOLIPASE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5; PNPLA5
;;GS2-LIKE PROTEIN; GS2L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Human patatin-like phospholipases, such as PNPLA5, have been implicated
in regulation of adipocyte differentiation and have been induced by
metabolic stimuli (Wilson et al., 2006).

CLONING

By database analysis, followed by screening of human EST databases,
Wilson et al. (2006) identified PNPLA5, which encodes a 429-amino acid
protein containing a patatin-like domain and 2 glycosaminoglycan sites.
Structural analysis determined that the patatin-like domain was composed
of a beta-sheet sandwiched by alpha-helices in approximately 3 layers.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that PNPLA5 was expressed at
moderate levels in brain and at very low levels in liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Gao and Simon (2007) measured retinol transacylation activity and found
that PNPLA5 appeared to inhibit transacylation catalyzed by endogenous
enzymes, but it had measurable retinylester hydrolysis activity.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PNPLA5
gene to chromosome 22 (TMAP G65439).

;;KIAA1951
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned ZNF526, which they designated
KIAA1951. The cDNA has several repetitive elements in its 3-prime UTR.
The deduced protein contains 679 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected
variable ZNF526 expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific
adult brain regions examined. Highest expression was in ovary, followed
by lung, pancreas, spleen, testis, spinal cord, and fetal liver.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the ZNF526 gene to chromosome 19q13.2 based on an
alignment of the ZNF526 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB075831) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

607977	TITLE *607977 HEADCASE, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; HECA
;;HDC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HECA is a homolog of the Drosophila 'headcase' protein (hdc). In
Drosophila, hdc is required for adult development and is an inhibitor of
epithelial sprouting and branching morphogenesis.

CLONING

By searching an EST database and screening cDNA libraries to identify
genes located in a region of chromosome 6q that is commonly deleted in
pancreatic cancers, Makino et al. (2001) cloned HECA, which they called
HDC. The deduced protein contains 543 amino acids and the transcript has
a long 3-prime untranslated region. HECA shares 40% identity over 320
amino acids with Drosophila hdc. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous expression of a 5.6-kb transcript.

GENE FUNCTION

Makino et al. (2001) found low expression of HECA in 17 of 21 (81%)
pancreatic cancer cell lines and in 4 of 5 (80%) renal cell carcinoma
cell lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Makino et al. (2001) determined that the HECA gene contains 4 exons. The
last exon is large and contains an Alu repeat in the 3-prime
untranslated region in the opposite strand.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Makino et al. (2001) mapped the HECA gene
to chromosome 6q24.

TACC1/FGFR1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Amplification of various chromosomal regions in human breast carcinomas
has lead to the identification of protooncogenes involved in
tumorigenesis. For example, MYC (190080) in 8q24, CCND1 (168461) in
11q13, and ERBB2 (164870) in 17q12 are each observed in 20% of all
breast tumors. Still et al. (1999) noted that 8p11 is amplified in 10 to
15% of breast tumor samples but the only gene assigned to this region,
FGFR1 (136350), is typically expressed at the same levels in normal and
tumor breast tissue. By PCR analysis with primers obtained from an EST
database, generation of a BAC contig spanning 380 kb of the 8p11 breast
cancer amplicon-1, and probing fetal tissue libraries, Still et al.
(1999) isolated a cDNA encoding TACC1. The predicted 805-amino acid
TACC1 protein is rich in serine, proline, and acidic residues, has a
20-amino acid N terminus rich in tryptophan, contains 2 nuclear
localization signals but no DNA- or RNA-binding domains, and has a
200-residue C terminus with extensive alpha-helical segments expected to
adopt a coiled-coil structure. Northern blot analysis detected a major
8.0-kb TACC1 transcript in all tissues tested, with relatively weak
expression in liver and lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Still et al. (1999) found that introduction of TACC1 into stable cell
lines resulted in morphologic changes consistent with a transformed
phenotype and in anchorage-independent growth.

By yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, Lauffart et al.
(2002) showed that TACC1 interacted with C-terminal regions of CHTOG
(CKAP5; 611142) and GAS41 (YEATS4; 602116).

During neurogenesis, the nuclei of progenitor cells of the proliferative
ventricular zone oscillate in a cell cycle-dependent manner called
interkinetic nuclear migration (INM). In most cell types, the nucleus
closely follows the centrosome during migration; however, in neural
progenitors, centrosomes remain near the ventricular zone during INM.
Xie et al. (2007) showed that INM in mice was dependent on the
regulation of centrosome-associated microtubules by Cep120 (613446) and
Taccs. Cep120 and Taccs regulated the integrity of microtubules coupling
the centrosome and the nucleus. Cep120 interacted with Taccs and
regulated the localization of Tacc3 (605303) to the centrosome. Both
Cep120 and Taccs were essential for maintaining the neural progenitor
pool during mouse neocortical development.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Singh et al. (2012) reported that a small subset of glioblastoma
multiforme tumors (GBMs; 137800) (3.1%; 3 of 97 tumors examined) harbors
oncogenic chromosomal translocations that fuse in-frame the tyrosine
kinase coding domains of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes
FGFR1 (136350) or FGFR3 (134934) to the transforming acidic coiled-coil
(TACC) coding domains of TACC1 or TACC3 (605303), respectively. The
FGFR-TACC fusion protein displayed oncogenic activity when introduced
into astrocytes or stereotactically transduced in the mouse brain. The
fusion protein, which localizes to mitotic spindle poles, has
constitutive kinase activity and induces mitotic and chromosomal
segregation defects and triggers aneuploidy. Inhibition of FGFR kinase
corrected the aneuploidy, and oral administration of an FGFR inhibitor
prolonged survival of mice harboring intracranial FGFR3-TACC3-initiated
glioma. Singh et al. (2012) concluded that FGFR-TACC fusions could
potentially identify a subset of GBM patients who would benefit from
targeted FGFR kinase inhibition.

603157	TITLE *603157 PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3-KINASE, REGULATORY SUBUNIT 2; PIK3R2
;;PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3-KINASE, REGULATORY SUBUNIT, 85-KD, BETA;;
p85-BETA
PIK3R2/UPS8 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is a lipid kinase that
phosphorylates the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol and related
compounds at the 3-prime position. The products of these reactions serve
as second messengers in growth signaling pathways. The kinase itself is
made up of a catalytic subunit of molecular mass 110 kD (PIK3CA; 171834)
and a regulatory subunit of either 85 kD, 55 kD, or 50 kD. Otsu et al.
(1991) showed that the bovine PI3K p85 subunit consists of 2 closely
related proteins, p85-alpha (171833) and p85-beta. They cloned cDNAs
encoding both p85 subunits, each of which is 724 amino acids long. The
subunits share 62% amino acid identity across their entire length. Both
sequences contain an N-terminal SH3 region, 2 SH2 regions, and a region
of homology to BCR (151410).

Janssen et al. (1998) determined the human p85-beta cDNA sequence.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional expression studies by Otsu et al. (1991) showed that both
bovine p85 subunits bound tyrosine kinase receptors.

Hale et al. (2006) generated a laryngeal carcinoma cell line
constitutively expressing influenza A virus NS1 protein and found that
NS1 bound specifically to p85-beta. The NS1 protein from various
influenza strains also bound p85-beta, but not p85-alpha. Expression of
NS1 led to induction of PI3K signaling, including phosphorylation of AKT
(164730) at ser473. Binding of p85-beta and activation of PI3K required
tyr89 of NS1, and mutant viruses expressing NS1 with a tyr89-to-phe
substitution grew more slowly in cell culture than wildtype viruses.
Hale et al. (2006) proposed that activation of PI3K signaling in
influenza A virus-infected cells is important for efficient virus
replication.

Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Park et al. (2010) showed that, in
addition to regulating PI3K function, p85-alpha and p85-beta regulated
the function of Xbp1s (XBP1; 194355), a transcription factor that
orchestrates the unfolded protein response (UPR) following endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress. Both p85-alpha and p85-beta bound Xbp1s and
increased its nuclear translocation, and it appeared that the p110 PI3K
catalytic subunit and Xbp1s competed for binding of these regulatory
subunits. p85-alpha and p85-beta formed an inactive dimer that was
disrupted by insulin in a time-dependent manner, which promoted their
association with Xbp1s. Refeeding of wildtype mice after fasting induced
ER stress that was quickly resolved, as measured by Xbp1s levels. In
contrast, obese and insulin-resistant ob/ob (LEP; 164160) mice could not
resolve the ER stress induced during refeeding, and nuclear
translocation of Xbp1s was absent in ob/ob mice. Overexpression of
p85-alpha or p85-beta in livers of ob/ob mice increased glucose
tolerance and reduced blood glucose concentrations.

To assess the impact of the AKT3 (611223), PIK3R2, and PIK3CA mutations
in individuals with megalencephaly-capillary malformation-polymicrogyria
syndrome (MCAP; 602501) and megalencephaly polymicrogyria-polydactyly
hydrocephalus syndrome (MPPH; 603387) on PI3K activity, Riviere et al.
(2012) used immunostaining to compare PIP3 amounts in lymphoblastoid
cell lines derived from 4 mutation carriers with megalencephaly to those
in control and PTEN (601728)-mutant cells. Consistent with elevated PI3K
activity, and similar to what is seen with PTEN loss, all 3 lines with
PIK3R2 or PIK3CA mutations showed significantly more PIP3 staining than
control cells, as well as greater localization of active
phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDPK1; 605213) to the cell
membrane. Treatment with the PI3K inhibitor PI-103 resulted in less PIP3
in the PIK3R2 G373R (603157.0001) and PIK3CA E453del (171834.0014)
mutant lines, confirming that these results are PI3K-dependent. Riviere
et al. (2012) found no evidence for increased PI3K activity in the
AKT3-mutant line, consistent with a mutation affecting a downstream
effector of PI3K. Protein blot analysis showed higher amounts of
phosphorylated S6 protein and 4E-BP1 in all mutant cell lines compared
to controls. Although PI-103 treatment reduced S6 phosphorylation in
control and mutant lines, the latter showed relative resistance to PI3K
inhibition, consistent with elevated signaling through the pathway.
Riviere et al. (2012) concluded that the megalencephaly-associated
mutations result in higher PI3K activity and PI3K-mTOR signaling.

MAPPING

Volinia et al. (1992) used in situ hybridization to map the PIK3R2 gene
to human chromosome 19q13.2-q13.4.

CYTOGENETICS

Janssen et al. (1998) analyzed DNA from a patient with chronic
myeloproliferative disorder. They identified an oncogenic fusion of the
5-prime end of p85-beta and the 3-prime end of HUMORF8 (USP8; 603158).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Riviere et al. (2012) performed exome sequencing in the oldest of 3
affected sibs with MPPH and identified a heterozygous mutation in the
PIK3R2 gene (G373R; 603157.0001). Sanger sequencing confirmed the
presence of the mutation in all 3 affected sibs and its absence in the
saliva and blood of both parents and the unaffected sister, showing
germline mosaicism in 1 parent. Sequencing of the PIK3R2 gene in 40
individuals with megalencephaly identified the same nucleotide change in
10 additional subjects with MPPH, and this mutation was shown to be de
novo in all subjects for whom parental DNA was available. The mutation
occurred at a CpG dinucleotide, which might explain its recurrence.

ANIMAL MODEL

Oak et al. (2006) crossed mice with a floxed Pik3r1 allele and a null
Pik3r2 allele with Lck (153390)-Cre transgenic mice to generate a strain
in which class IA Pi3k expression and function were essentially
abrogated in T cells beginning at the double-negative stage.
Histopathologic analysis of these mice showed development of
organ-specific autoimmunity resembling Sjogren syndrome (SS; 270150). By
3 to 8 months of age, mutant mice developed corneal opacity and eye
lesions due to irritation and constant scratching. Mutant mice showed
marked lymphocytic infiltration of lacrimal glands and serum antinuclear
and anti-Ssa (SSA1; 109092) antibodies, but no kidney pathology.
Cd4-positive T cells, which were the predominant infiltrating cells in
lacrimal glands of mutant mice, exhibited aberrant differentiation in
vitro. Oak et al. (2006) concluded that impaired class IA PI3K signaling
in T cells can lead to organ-specific autoimmunity, and they proposed
that class IA Pi3k-deficient mice manifest the cardinal features of
human primary SS.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MEGALENCEPHALY-POLYMICROGYRIA-POLYDACTYLY-HYDROCEPHALUS SYNDROME
PIK3R2, GLY373ARG

In 13 individuals with
megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome (MPPH;
603387) from 11 unrelated families, Riviere et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous 1117G-A transition in the PIK3R2 gene, resulting in a
gly373-to-arg (G373R) substitution in the PIK3R2 gene. This mutation was
shown to be de novo in all subjects for whom parental DNA was available.
The mutation occurred at a CpG dinucleotide, which might explain its
recurrence.

604528	TITLE *604528 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-GATED, SUBFAMILY H, MEMBER 4; KCNH4
;;POTASSIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-GATED, ETHER-A-GO-GO-RELATED SUBFAMILY,
MEMBER 4;;
BRAIN-SPECIFIC EAG-LIKE CHANNEL 2; BEC2
DESCRIPTION Voltage-gated potassium channels play an essential role in controlling
cellular excitability in the nervous system by regulating a variety of
neuronal properties, such as interspike membrane potential, action
potential waveform, and firing frequency. These channels constitute an
evolutionarily related superfamily that can be classified into 2 groups,
the Shaker family and the ether-a-go-go (eag) family. The eag family
includes Drosophila eag, human EAG (KCNH1; 603305), rat Eag, Drosophila
eag-related gene (erg), human ERG (KCNH2; 152427), and rat Elk. Members
of the eag family are related to cyclic nucleotide-gated cation
channels, hyperpolarization-activated cation channels, and plant
hyperpolarization-activated potassium channels. A common feature of the
C terminus of eag-type channels is a putative cyclic nucleotide-binding
(CNB) domain. By RT-PCR of human brain RNA using oligonucleotides based
on a rat Kcnh4 cDNA, Miyake et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding
KCNH4, which they named BEC2. The predicted 1,017-amino acid KCNH4
protein has 6 transmembrane domains, the pore region of voltage-gated
potassium channels, a CNB domain, and putative N-glycosylation sites.
KCNH4 shares 89% amino acid sequence identity with rat Kcnh4 and 48%
identity with human BEC1 (KCNH3; 604527). The authors concluded that
KCNH4, BEC1, and Elk form a subfamily within the eag family. Expression
of recombinant KCNH4 in mammalian cells induced a voltage-gated outward
current without a fast inactivation component. Northern blot analysis
and RT-PCR of human tissues showed KCNH4 expression only in brain; 4.4-,
7.5-, and 10-kb KCNH4 transcripts were detected on Northern blots.
Within brain, KCNH4 expression was restricted to the telencephalon. It
was predominantly expressed in the striatal regions, such as the putamen
and caudate nucleus, but was also expressed in the cerebral cortex and
hippocampus. Miyake et al. (1999) suggested that KCNH4 is involved in
cellular excitability of restricted neurons in the human central nervous
system.

300161	TITLE *300161 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 2, SUBUNIT 3; EIF2S3
;;EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 2, GAMMA; EIF2G
DESCRIPTION Translation initiation factor eIF-2 is a heterotrimeric GTP-binding
protein involved in the recruitment of methionyl-tRNA(i) to the 40 S
ribosomal subunit. Gaspar et al. (1994) cloned a human cDNA encoding the
largest subunit of eIF-2, EIF2G. The EIF2G cDNA encodes a 472-amino acid
protein with a molecular mass of 51.8 kD and contains 3 consensus
GTP-binding elements. Human EIF2G is highly related to the yeast
homolog, GCD11, exhibiting 71% sequence identity and an additional 13%
similarity.

Genes controlling the functions of spermatogenesis, Spy, and expression
of the male-specific minor transplantation antigen H-Y, Hya (426000),
map to a region of the short arm of the mouse Y chromosome,
delta-Sxr(b), that lies between the zinc finger genes Zfy1 and Zfy2
(490000) and is deleted in Sxr(b) mutant mice. These Sxr(b) mice arose
from an original sex-reversed mutation, Sxr(a), that carries a
duplication of most of the Y chromosome short arm translocated to the
telomeric end of the pseudoautosomal region of the Y chromosome. Several
genes were mapped to that interval of the mouse Y chromosome and each
was found to have a homolog on the X chromosome. Four of them, Zfy1 and
Zfy2 (490000), Ube1y (489000), and Dffry (400005), are expressed
specifically in the testis and their X homologs (Zfx, 314980; Ube1x,
314370; Dffrx, 300072) are not transcribed from the inactive X
chromosome. A further 2, Smyc (426000) and Uty (400009), are
ubiquitously expressed and their X homologs (Jarid1c/Smcx, 314690; Utx,
300128) escape X inactivation. Ehrmann et al. (1998) identified another
gene from this region of the mouse Y chromosome. It was found to encode
the highly conserved eukaryotic translation initiation factor
eIF-2-gamma. In the mouse this gene was found to be ubiquitously
expressed, to have an X chromosome homolog that maps close to Dmd
(300377), and to escape X inactivation. The coding regions of the X and
Y genes show 86% nucleotide identity and encode the putative products
with 98% amino acid identity. Ehrmann et al. (1998) found that the human
homolog is located on Xp21 and also escapes X inactivation. No evidence
of a Y copy of this gene was found in humans, however. In both humans
and mice, Ehrmann et al. (1998) identified autosomal retroposons of
EIF2G in both humans and mice and an additional retroposon on the X
chromosome in some mouse strains. Ark blot analysis of eutherian and
metatherian genomic DNA indicated that X-Y homologs are present in all
species tested except in simian primates and kangaroo and that
retroposons are common to a wide range of mammals. ('Zoo blots' are
Southern blots of genomic DNA from multiple species without regard to
gender; 'ark blots' are Southern blots used to compare male and female
from multiple species.)

Ehrmann et al. (1998) mapped the human EIF2S3 gene to Xp21 by isotopic
in situ hybridization. The largest number of grains were located on the
region Xp22.2-p22.1. A secondary hybridization repeat was detected on
12p13.2-p12.3. No significant accumulation of grains was detected on the
human Y chromosome.

;;GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATASE, CATALYTIC, 1; G6PC1;;
G6PT, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9), the key enzyme in the homeostasis
regulation of blood glucose concentrations, catalyzes the terminal step
in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis (summary by Lei et al., 1993).

CLONING

Lei et al. (1993) cloned human G6PC from a liver cDNA library. G6PC
encodes a predicted 357-amino acid protein with an endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) retention signal and 6 putative membrane-spanning segments. The
expressed protein is indistinguishable from human microsomal G6Pase. Lei
et al. (1993) stated that the gene had previously eluded molecular
characterization primarily because of its tight association with the ER
and nuclear membranes.

Shelly et al. (1993) isolated cDNAs encoding G6Pase by taking advantage
of an albino deletion mutant mouse that is known to express markedly
reduced levels of G6Pase activity. The primary defect of this mutant
mouse is a loss of the fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase gene (FAH; 613871)
located near the albino locus on chromosome 7. Fumarylacetoacetate
hydrolase (or fumarylacetoacetase) is the final enzyme in the tyrosine
degradation pathway, and a deficiency of this enzyme leads to the
accumulation of toxic tyrosine metabolites, resulting in reduced
expression of a group of liver-specific proteins, including G6Pase.
Newborn homozygous deletion mice develop hypoglycemia shortly after
birth, correlating with undetectable levels of G6Pase activity. Shelly
et al. (1993) isolated a full-length cDNA encoding murine liver
microsomal G6Pase by screening a normal mouse liver cDNA library
differentially with probes representing mRNA populations from the normal
and the albino deletion mutant mouse. They showed that the murine G6Pase
transcription unit spans approximately 10 kb and consists of 5 exons.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lei et al. (1993) determined that the G6PC gene contains 5 exons and
spans approximately 12.5 kb.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Lei et al. (1994) mapped the G6PC
gene to chromosome 17.

In the course of constructing a transcription map of approximately 600
kb of genomic DNA surrounding the BRCA1 gene (113705), Brody et al.
(1995) identified the G6PC gene, thus regionalizing its assignment to
17q21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 patients with glycogen storage disease Ia (GSD1a; 232200), Lei et
al. (1993) identified homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations,
respectively, in the G6PC gene (613742.0001-613742.0003).

Lei et al. (1995) used SSCP analysis and DNA sequencing to characterize
the G6PC gene of 70 unrelated patients with enzymatically confirmed
diagnosis of type Ia GSD and detected mutations in all except 17 alleles
(88%). They uncovered 16 mutations that were shown by expression to
abolish or greatly reduce G6Pase activity and that, therefore, were
responsible for the clinical disorder. R83C (613742.0002) and Q347X
(613742.0004) were the most prevalent mutations found in Caucasians;
130X (613742.0001) and R83C were most prevalent in Hispanics; R83H was
most prevalent in Chinese. The Q347X mutation was identified only in
Caucasians, and the 130X mutation was identified only in Hispanic
patients.

Kajihara et al. (1995) identified a splice mutation in exon 5 (727G-T)
of the G6PC cDNA from the liver of a Japanese patient with GSD type Ia
(613742.0005). Another 8 unrelated Japanese families with a total of 9
affected individuals were found to have the same mutation, thus
representing 91% of patients and carriers of GSD Ia in Japan.

Chevalier-Porst et al. (1996) sequenced both alleles of 24 French GSD
type Ia patients; 14 different mutations were found, allowing the
identification of complete genotypes for all the patients. These
included 9 new mutations. Five mutations, Q347X, R83C, D38V
(613742.0006), G188R (613742.0012), and 158Cdel, accounted for 75% of
the mutated alleles.

Parvari et al. (1997) reported the biochemical and clinical
characteristics as well as mutation analyses of 12 Israeli GSD Ia
patients of different families, who represent most of the GSD Ia
patients in Israel. All 9 Jewish patients, as well as a Muslim Arab
patient, were found to have the R83C mutation (613742.0002). Two Muslim
Arab patients had the val166-to-gly (V166G) mutation (613742.0014),
which had not been found in other populations.

Akanuma et al. (2000) identified G6PC mutations in all alleles from 51
unrelated Japanese patients with GSD Ia. A total of 7 mutations were
identified, including 3 novel mutations. The most prevalent mutation,
727G-T, accounting for 88 of 102 mutant alleles, creates an aberrant
3-prime splice site within exon 5. The authors demonstrated that
ectopically transcribed G6Pase mRNA can be detected in lymphoblastoid
cells and may be used for the characterization of mutations that affect
mRNA splicing. They concluded that noninvasive molecular diagnosis may
ultimately replace the conventional method of enzymatic diagnosis that
requires liver biopsy in Japanese patients.

Stroppiano et al. (1999) analyzed the G6Pase gene in 53 unrelated
Italian patients and identified 88 mutant alleles (82.6%) with 18
(17.4%) remaining unidentified. The most prevalent mutation was R83C
(46.2%), followed by Q347X (20.7%); 3 other mutations (R295C, D38V, and
G270V) accounted for 5.6% of disease alleles. The authors suggested that
noninvasive screening could be used in Italian patients clinically
suspected of having GSD Ia, particularly in those from Sicily, where the
R83C mutation was present in 80% of mutant alleles. In all of 13
unrelated Korean patients with GSD Ia, Ki et al. (2004) identified
mutant alleles of the G6PC gene. Three known mutations and 2 novel
mutations were identified. The most frequent mutant allele was 727G-T,
present in 21 of 26 alleles (81%), which was slightly lower than that in
Japanese, where it was present in 86 alleles (92%), but much higher than
that in Taiwan Chinese (present in 44.4% of alleles).

G6PC, 2-BP INS, 459AT

In a patient with type Ia glycogen storage disease (232200), Lei et al.
(1993) found a 2-bp insertion at nucleotide 459 (ATins459) in exon 3 of
the G6PC gene. The insertion caused a frameshift with generation of a
stop codon at nucleotides 467-469. The predicted gene product was a
severely truncated protein of 129 amino acids. The patient was
homozygous for the TA insertion and the mother, the only parent
available, was heterozygous. Lei et al. (1995) referred to this mutation
as 130X referring to the number of the stop codon that was generated by
the frameshift. The 130X mutation had been identified only in Hispanic
patients.

.0002
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, ARG83CYS

Lei et al. (1993) concluded that a patient with type Ia glycogen storage
disease (232200) was a compound heterozygote for 2 different G6PC
mutations: arg83-to-cys (R83C) and arg295-to-cys (R295C; 613742.0003),
located in exons 2 and 5, respectively. The exon 5 mutation came from
the father and the exon 2 mutation from the mother. Both mutations were
thought to involve a CpG doublet. Lei et al. (1994) demonstrated that
the R83C mutant has no detectable phosphohydrolase activity.

In a patient originally reported by Burchell and Waddell (1990) as
having a novel form of type 1 glycogen storage disease due to a defect
in the 21-kD stabilizing protein SP, Lei et al. (1995) demonstrated that
in fact there was an R83C mutation in exon 2 of the G6PC gene. They
found the same mutation in both homozygous and heterozygous form in
patients with standard GSD type Ia.

Qu et al. (1996) performed prenatal diagnosis by chorionic villus
sampling in an Ashkenazi Jewish family in which a previous child was
homoallelic and both parents were heterozygous for the R83C mutation.
Molecular analysis showed that the fetus was not affected.

Parvari et al. (1997) found that the R83C mutation was present in all
Ashkenazi Jewish patients studied in Israel, suggesting that DNA-based
diagnosis may be used as an initial diagnostic step in this population,
thus avoiding liver biopsy.

Ekstein et al. (2004) tested 20,719 Ashkenazi Jewish subjects for the
R83C mutation and identified 290 carriers, giving a carrier frequency of
0.014. The authors noted that this carrier frequency translates into a
predicted disease prevalence of 1 in 20,000, 5 times higher than that
for the general Caucasian population, confirming a founder effect and
elevated frequency of type Ia glycogen storage disease in the Ashkenazi
population. They also tested 4,290 Ashkenazi subjects for the Q347X
(613742.0004) mutation and found no carriers. Of 30 Ashkenazi Jewish
patients with type Ia glycogen storage disease, all were homozygous for
the R83C mutation. Ekstein et al. (2004) concluded that R83C is the only
prevalent mutation for this disease in the Ashkenazi population.

GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, GLN347TER

In a patient with type Ia glycogen storage disease (232200), Lei et al.
(1994) demonstrated compound heterozygosity for an arg83-to-cys mutation
(613742.0002) in exon 2 and a gln347-to-ter mutation in exon 5. The
latter mutation was detected in homozygous form in 2 sibs of an
unrelated family. The predicted Q347X mutant G6Pase is a truncated
protein of 346 amino acids, 11 amino acids shorter than the wildtype
G6Pase. Site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression assays
demonstrated that the mutant protein is devoid of G6Pase activity.

.0005
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, IVS4AS, G-T, +86

In a 26-year-old man with GSD Ia (232200) and in 9 other Japanese
patients from 8 unrelated families, Kajihara et al. (1995) identified a
splicing mutation in the G6PC gene. The first patient was the progeny of
first-cousin parents and had a history of hepatomegaly and hypoglycemia
since childhood. The diagnosis of GSD Ia was based on the findings of
hypoglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia and liver biopsy
abnormalities. Residual G6Pase activity in the liver was 18% of normal
in both fresh and previously frozen liver biopsy specimens. A younger
brother was also affected. The cDNA prepared from the patient's liver
had a deletion of 91 nucleotides with no normal-sized cDNA. The mutation
resulted in a G6Pase polypeptide 146 amino acids shorter at the
carboxy-terminal portion than the normal gene product of 357 residues.
It was thought that the 18% of normal activity reflected nonspecific
phosphatase activity since the G6Pase activity was low or not detectable
in several unrelated GSD Ia patients homozygous for this mutation.
Analysis of mutant genomic DNA demonstrated a G-to-T transversion at
nucleotide 727 of their G6PC sequence. Although the patient's splice
site in intron 4 and exon 5 had a normal consensus sequence, normal
splicing did not occur. It is thought that the single base substitution,
located far from the splice junction, altered the splice site. Kajihara
et al. (1995) cited data indicating that 11% of aberrant splice
mutations represent the creation of new splice sites with no alteration
in the authentic splice site sequences. Nakai and Sakamoto (1994) found
that new 5-prime and 3-prime sites were created only in the upstream
region of the authentic 5-prime and 3-prime splice sites. However, this
characteristically Japanese GSD Ia mutation is an exception; a new
3-prime site occurred in the downstream region of a normal splice site.

Akanuma et al. (2000) found that the most prevalent mutation in a study
of 51 unrelated Japanese patients with GSD Ia was 727G-T, accounting for
88 of 102 mutant alleles.

.0006
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, ASP38VAL

In 4 unrelated French patients with GSD type Ia (232200),
Chevalier-Porst et al. (1996) found compound heterozygosity for a D38V
missense mutation in the G6PC gene. This resulted from an A-to-T
transversion of nucleotide 192 in exon 1. The mutation was predicted to
change an acidic amino acid (aspartic acid) to a nonpolar hydrophobic
amino acid (valine) in the middle of the first predicted transmembrane
spanning domain.

.0007
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, TRP77ARG

In a French patient with GSD type Ia (232200), Chevalier-Porst et al.
(1996) found compound heterozygosity for a W77R missense mutation in the
G6PC gene. The mutation changed a nonpolar hydrophobic amino acid
(tryptophan) to a basic one (arginine). The amino acid substitution
resulted from a T-to-C transition of nucleotide 308 in exon 1.

.0008
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, IVS1DS, A-G, +4

In a French patient with GSD Ia (232200), Chevalier-Porst et al. (1996)
found an A-to-G transition at position +4 of the 5-prime donor splice
site of intron 1 of the G6PC gene. The patient was a compound
heterozygote for this mutation and for the G188R mutation (613742.0012).

.0009
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, GLU110LYS

In a French patient with GSD Ia (232200), Chevalier-Porst et al. (1996)
found a E110K missense mutation in the G6PC gene. The mutation changed
an acidic amino acid (glutamic acid) to a basic amino acid (lysine). It
was due to a G-to-A transition of nucleotide 407 in exon 2. The mutation
was present in compound heterozygous state.

.0010
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, ALA124THR

In a French patient with GSD type Ia (232200), Chevalier-Porst et al.
(1996) identified a G-to-A transition of nucleotide 449 in exon 3 which
changed a nonpolar amino acid (alanine-124) to a polar one (threonine).
This mutation, inherited from the mother, was associated with the Q347X
mutation (613742.0004) in 2 sibs with GSD Ia.

.0011
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, GLY184GLU

In a French patient with type Ia glycogen storage disease (232200),
Chevalier-Porst et al. (1996) found a G-to-A transition of nucleotide
630 changing a nonpolar hydrophobic amino acid (glycine-184) to an
acidic one (glutamic acid). The G184E mutation is located in the
putative cytoplasmic domain of the enzyme. The mutation was present in
homozygous state in a family with no known consanguinity.

.0012
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, GLY188ARG

In 3 unrelated French patients with glycogen storage disease type Ia
(232200), Chevalier-Porst et al. (1996) found compound heterozygosity
for a G-to-C transversion of nucleotide 641, resulting in change of a
nonpolar hydrophobic amino acid (glycine-188) to a basic one (arginine).
This mutation, like G184E (613742.0011), is located in the putative
cytoplasmic domain of the enzyme.

Weston et al. (2000) identified a 5-month-old girl with hypoglycemia,
hepatomegaly, and lactic acidemia who was diagnosed with GSD Ia. She
also developed neutropenia, neutrophil dysfunction, and recurrent
infections characteristic of GSD Ib, but was found to be homozygous for
the G188R mutation of the G6PC gene. No mutations in the G6PC
translocase gene were identified. Weston et al. (2000) subsequently
identified a sib of this proband and 2 unrelated patients with similar
genotype-phenotype characteristics. They concluded that the unusual
association of neutrophil abnormalities in patients with homozygous
G188R mutations in the G6PC gene supports the modified
translocase/catalytic unit model.

.0013
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, ILE341ASP

In 2 sibs with type Ia GSD (232200), Lee et al. (1996) found compound
heterozygosity for an R83C substitution in exon 2 (613742.0002) and an
ile341-to-asp substitution in exon 5 of the G6PC gene. The nucleotide
substitutions were a G-to-A transition at base position 327 in exon 2
and a T-to-A transversion at base position 1101 in exon 5. The father
was heterozygous for the exon 2 mutation, while the mother was
heterozygous for the exon 5 mutation.

.0014
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, VAL166GLY

In 2 Muslim Arab patients in Israel with glycogen storage disease Ia
(232200), Parvari et al. (1997) identified a val166-to-gly (V166G)
missense mutation in the G6PC gene.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The HUWE1 gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase (summary by Froyen et al.,
2012).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) cloned HUWE1, which they designated
KIAA0312. RT-PCR analysis detected low HUWE1 expression in all tissues
examined.

By database analysis, Liu et al. (2005) identified full-length human
HUWE1, which they called LASU1. The deduced 4,374-amino acids protein
has a calculated molecular mass of 481.9 kD. It has 2 N-terminal domains
similar to domains found in an S. cerevisiae HECT domain ligase, Tom1,
followed by a ubiquitin (191339)-associated (UBA) domain, a
ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM), a WWE domain, and a C-terminal HECT
domain. The deduced full-length mouse Lasu1 protein contains 4,377 amino
acids.

Froyen et al. (2012) found expression of the Huwe1 gene in several mouse
tissues, including cortex, hippocampus, tongue, eye, kidney, liver,
adrenal gland, and fibroblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

Gu et al. (1994) found that a recombinant 310-amino acid Ureb1 protein
from rat brain specifically bound to the upstream regulatory element
(URE) in the promoter region of the rat preprodynorphin (PDYN; 131340)
gene. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Ureb1 increased transcription of a
reporter gene containing the URE.

Liu et al. (2005) showed that Lasu1 from bovine testis was a Ubc4
(UBE2D2; 602962)-dependent E3 ligase that ubiquitinated histones H1 (see
142709), H2A (see 613499), H2B (see 609904), H3 (see 602810), and H4
(see 602822) in vitro. Ubc4 isoform-1 and a testis-specific Ubc4 isoform
were the preferred E2s. Mass spectrometry and size analysis suggested
that Lasu1 functions as a monomer.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the HUWE1 gene
to chromosome X. Liu et al. (2005) mapped the mouse Huwe1 gene to
chromosome X.

CYTOGENETICS

Using X chromosome-specific array comparative genomic hybridization
(array-CGH), Froyen et al. (2008) identified overlapping
microduplications of chromosome Xp11.22 in affected individuals from 6
unrelated families with nonsyndromic X-linked mental retardation (MRX17;
300705). Subsequent PCR analysis showed that the duplicated regions
varied from 0.4 to 0.8 Mb with a common minimal overlapping region that
contained 2 candidate genes, HSD17B10 (300256) and HUWE1, both of which
showed 2- to 5-fold overexpression in blood cells from affected
individuals.

Froyen et al. (2012) reported 6 additional families with nonsyndromic
X-linked mental retardation associated with duplications at Xp11.22
(300705). All patients had mild to moderate intellectual disability, but
some were able to attend school. Most patients had some additional
variable features, but these features were not consistent enough to form
a discernible pattern. All female carriers were phenotypically normal.
Microarray analysis identified 6 different but overlapping duplications
of chromosome Xp11.22 ranging in size from 0.4 to 1.0 Mb that segregated
with the phenotype. Combined with the cytogenetic data from the 6
families reported by Froyen et al. (2008), Froyen et al. (2012) found
that the common minimal region of overlap is 228 kb, which contains the
HUWE1 gene and excludes the HSD17B10 gene. Cell lines from patients
showed 2-fold increased expression of HUWE1, and studies in 4 female
carriers showed skewed X inactivation. The authors concluded that HUWE1
is the dosage-sensitive gene for which a 2-fold overexpression results
in cognitive impairment in males. All proximal and distal breakpoints
differed, excluding nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) as the
common mechanism. Junction and in silico analysis of breakpoint regions
showed that some contained repetitive sequences, palindromes, increased
GC content, or microhomology-mediated rearrangements suggestive of
replication-based duplication events. The duplication was shown to be
due to NAHR in only 1 family, whereas it was due to other mechanisms in
the other families; however, many breakpoints could not adequately be
studied. The findings indicated that the Xp11.22 region is prone to
recombination- and replication-based rearrangements.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected individuals from 3 unrelated families with X-linked
syndromic mental retardation, Turner type (300706), Froyen et al. (2008)
identified a mutation in the HUWE1 gene (300697.0001-300697.0003). There
was some phenotypic variability between the families: 1 had associated
macrocephaly, whereas the others had mild and profound mental
retardation, respectively.

et al. (2008) identified a 12037C-T transition in the HUWE1 gene,
resulting in an arg4013-to-trp (R4013W) substitution. The mutation

an arg4187-to-cys (R4187C) substitution. The mutation segregated with
the disorder and was not identified in 750 control individuals. Affected
individuals were profoundly retarded and showed variable contractures.

607672	TITLE *607672 CARDIOTROPHIN-LIKE CYTOKINE FACTOR 1; CLCF1
;;CLC;;
B-CELL STIMULATORY FACTOR 3; BSF3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CLCF1 belongs to the interleukin-6 (IL6; 147620) family of cytokines,
which are involved in cell signaling through phosphorylation of gp130
(IL6ST; 600694). IL6 family members share similarity in gene structure
and have a 4-helix bundle in their protein structure.

CLONING

Senaldi et al. (1999) cloned BSF3, which they also referred to as novel
neurotrophin-1 (NNT1), by subtractive hybridization using a cDNA library
prepared from phorbol ester-activated Jurkat T cells. The deduced
protein contains 225 amino acids, including a 27-amino acid signal
peptide. The mature form is predicted to be a 198-amino acid peptide
with a molecular mass of 22 kD. BSF3 contains 4 cysteine residues, 2 of
which are in the signal peptide, and 1 potential N-linked glycosylation
site. The secondary structure is predicted to contain alpha helices.
BSF3 shares 19 to 27% homology with other IL6 family members and 96%
homology with mouse Bsf3. Northern blot analysis revealed a 2.2-kb
transcript expressed predominantly in lymph nodes, spleen, peripheral
blood lymphocytes, bone marrow, and fetal liver. Northern blot analysis
of mouse tissues revealed strongest expression in lymph nodes, spleen,
liver, lung, uterus, and ovary. N-terminal amino acid analysis of BSF3
expressed in HEK293 cells confirmed removal of the signal peptide.

Using cardiotrophin-1 (CTF1; 600435) as query in a database search, Shi
et al. (1999) identified a full-length clone of CLC. CLC shares 29%
identity with CTF1 and 20 to 26% identity with other neuropoietic
cytokines. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.9-kb transcript expressed
at high levels in spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes, at moderate
levels in ovary, placenta, and kidney, and at low levels in colon,
heart, lung, and pancreas. The transcript in lung was slightly smaller
than that in other tissues. Shi et al. (1999) also detected CLC clones
in cDNA libraries prepared from activated or resting neutrophils, bone
marrow stromal cells, and synovial fibroblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

Senaldi et al. (1999) found that treatment of human neuroblastoma cells
with recombinant BSF3 resulted in phosphorylation of gp130, LIFR-beta
(151443), and STAT3 (102582). BSF3 supported the survival of chick
embryo motor and sympathetic neurons in culture in a dose-dependent
manner and induced growth of murine myeloid leukemia cells. Treatment of
mice with recombinant BSF3 increased the level of serum amyloid A
(104750), potentiated the induction of corticosterone and IL6 by IL1
(see 147760), and caused body weight loss and B-cell hyperplasia with
elevated serum IgG and IgM levels.

Shi et al. (1999) found that recombinant CLC induced the activation of
NFKB (see 164011) and SRE reporter constructs in several mammalian cell
lines. The signal transduction pathway for CLC was characterized in a
neuroblastoma cell line, and tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 and STAT1
(600555), but not STAT3, was detected.

GENE STRUCTURE

Senaldi et al. (1999) determined that the CLCF1 gene contains 3 exons
and spans approximately 6 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In an Australian man with cold-induced sweating syndrome (CISS2;
610313), Rousseau et al. (2006) identified compound heterozygosity for a
truncating (607672.0001) and a missense mutation (607672.0002) in the
CLCF1 gene. The mutations were not found in 140 control chromosomes.

In 2 Hungarian sisters with CISS2, Hahn et al. (2010) identified
compound heterozygous mutations in the CLCF1 gene (607672.0003 and
607672.0004).

MAPPING

By FISH, Senaldi et al. (1999) mapped the CLCF1 gene to chromosome
11q13. By radiation hybrid analysis, Shi et al. (1999) mapped the CLCF1
gene to chromosome 11q13.3.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COLD-INDUCED SWEATING SYNDROME 2
CLCF1, TYR107TER

In an Australian man with cold-induced sweating syndrome-2 (CISS2;
610313), Rousseau et al. (2006) identified compound heterozygosity for a
321C-A transversion and a 590G-T transversion in the CLCF1 gene,
resulting in a tyr107-to-ter (Y107X) and an arg197-to-leu (R197L;
607672.0002) substitution, respectively. The mutations were not found in
140 control chromosomes. Transfection studies demonstrated that
truncated CLC containing a stop codon at position 107 cannot be
correctly processed and expressed in mammalian cells. Functional studies
of R197L CLC revealed an incapacity for the mutant protein to bind to
CNTFR (118946) and activate subsequent signaling events; structural and
docking interaction studies showed that the R197L substitution
destabilized the contact site between CLC and CNTFR.

the CLCF1 gene: a 46T-C transition resulting in a cys16-to-arg (C16R)
substitution, and a 676T-C transition (607672.0004) resulting in the

612895	TITLE *612895 NUCLEOREDOXIN; NXN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kurooka et al. (1997) cloned mouse nucleoredoxin from a neonatal skin
cDNA library. The deduced 435-amino acid protein is rich in acidic amino
acids, has an internal long direct repeat, and shares significant
similarity with thioredoxin (TXN; 187700). Northern blot analysis
detected several nucleoredoxin splice variants in adult mouse tissues,
with highest expression in testis and skin and lowest expression in
liver. In situ hybridization showed that expression of nucleoredoxin
varied during mouse embryonic development. Expression was widespread in
embryos at days 9.5 and 10.5, with expression in limb buds, somites,
dorsal root ganglia, branchial bars, and parts of the brain, but
expression was marginal at day 12.5. Epitope-tagged nucleoredoxin
localized to nuclei of transfected COS-7 cells. Southern blot analysis
detected nucleoredoxin orthologs in human, rat, and rabbit, but not in
frog, fly, nematode, and yeast.

GENE FUNCTION

Kurooka et al. (1997) showed that the recombinant C-terminal domain of
mouse nucleoredoxin had oxidoreductase activity toward the disulfide
bonds of insulin (INS; 176730), with kinetics similar to that of
purified E. coli thioredoxin. Deletion of 55 N-terminal amino acids from
the construct, including the putative redox active site, resulted in a
protein that failed to reduce insulin.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the NXN gene to chromosome 17p13.3 based on an
alignment of the NXN sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF086523) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

Kurooka et al. (1997) mapped the mouse Nxn gene to chromosome 11.

606101	TITLE *606101 EGF-LIKE MODULE-CONTAINING, MUCIN-LIKE HORMONE RECEPTOR 3; EMR3
DESCRIPTION Epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530)-7-transmembrane (TM7) proteins are
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) found on monocytes and neutrophils.
They include mouse F4/80, mouse and human CD97 (601211), and EMR1
(600493), the likely human homolog of F4/80. EGF-TM7 glycoproteins have
variable numbers of N-terminal EGF-like repeats coupled to a family-B
GPCR-related moiety via a mucin-like stalk.

CLONING

By searching DNA databases, using 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, and
screening a spleen cDNA library, Stacey et al. (2001) identified cDNAs
encoding EMR2 (606100), EMR3, and splice variants of each. The deduced
652-amino acid EMR3 protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide, 2
EGF-like domains, the first of which does not contain a calcium-binding
sequence, a mucin-like spacer region with several N- and O-linked
glycosylation sites, a putative GPCR proteolytic site, a TM7 region, and
a 51-residue cytoplasmic tail. A truncated EMR3 splice variant
containing only the 2 EGF-like domains and no transmembrane domain was
predicted to be a soluble protein. Northern blot analysis of tissues and
RT-PCR analysis of cell lines revealed that expression of 2.4- and
4.0-kb EMR3 transcripts was restricted to leukocytes. Flow cytometric
screening demonstrated that EMR3, but not EMR2, interacts with
monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils activated with fMLP but not
with CD55 (125240), the CD97 ligand. Stacey et al. (2001) noted that
EMR3 and EMR2 share a high degree of sequence identity in the TM domains
but not in the extracellular domains, whereas EMR2 and CD97 are highly
homologous in the EGF-like domains but not in the transmembrane domains,
suggesting different ligand-binding and intracellular signaling
activities.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Stacey et al. (2001) mapped the EMR3 gene
to 19p13.1, close to the other EGF-TM7 genes.

606442	TITLE *606442 ABL INTERACTOR 2; ABI2
;;ABL-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; AIP1
DESCRIPTION The ABL protein (ABL1; 189980) is the cellular homolog of the Abl
oncogene product of Abelson murine leukemia virus. ABL is a tyrosine
kinase that may regulate signal transduction events in the cytoplasm and
processes in the nucleus. The transforming Abl proteins are
constitutively active tyrosine kinases primarily localized in the
cytoplasm. They are repressed by SH3 domains and possibly by other
regions.

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a lymphocyte cDNA library with the ABL1
SH3 domain as bait, Dai and Pendergast (1995) isolated a cDNA encoding
ABI2. Sequence analysis predicted that the 401-amino acid ABI2 protein
is 65% identical to the Abi1 mouse protein and 70% identical to the frog
Xlan4 protein. ABI2 possesses a basic N terminus with homology to a
homeodomain protein; a central serine-rich region; 3 PEST sequences,
which are implicated in susceptibility to protein degradation; several
proline-rich stretches; and an acidic C terminus with multiple
phosphorylation sites and an SH3 domain. Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous but variable expression of 7.0- and 1.9-kb ABI2 transcripts.
Binding and mutational analyses showed that the interaction between the
N-terminal proline-rich stretch of ABI2 and the ABL1 SH3 domain is
highly specific, but that the ABI2 SH3 domain also binds to a
proline-rich stretch downstream of the nuclear localization signal in
the ABL1 C terminus. Immunoblot and autoradiographic analyses indicated
that ABI2 is phosphorylated by ABL1. ABI2 mutants lacking the N-terminal
proline-rich ABL1 SH3 domain-binding residues activated the transforming
capacity of ABL1. Dai and Pendergast (1995) suggested that the ABI
proteins may function to coordinate the cytoplasmic and nuclear
functions of the ABL1 tyrosine kinase.

MAPPING

By analysis of a YAC and a BAC, Machado et al. (2000) mapped the ABI2
gene to 2q31-q33.

605568	TITLE *605568 SMAD-SPECIFIC E3 UBIQUITIN PROTEIN LIGASE 1; SMURF1
;;SMAD UBIQUITINATION REGULATORY FACTOR 1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with frog Smad1 (601595) as bait, Zhu et
al. (1999) identified cDNAs encoding frog and human SMURF1. Frog and
human SMURF1 contain 731 amino acids, share 91% identity, are most
closely related to yeast Pub1, and have significant homology to the Hect
subclass of E3 ubiquitin ligases.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhu et al. (1999) found that expression of SMURF1 caused a
dose-dependent decrease in expression of SMAD1 and SMAD5 (603110), which
function in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP; see 603248) signaling, but
not in expression of SMAD2 (601366) or SMAD3 (603109), which function in
TGFB (190180) signaling. Pulse-chase analysis demonstrated that
degradation of SMAD proteins occurs by ubiquitination of the SMAD Hect
domain and transport to the proteasome. Mutational analysis indicated
that the WW motif of SMURF1 associates with SMAD1 and SMAD5 through
their PY motifs. In frog eggs, Smurf1 mRNA was localized to the animal
pole; ectopic Smurf1 in frog embryos inhibited the transmission of BMP
signals, affecting pattern formation.

Wang et al. (2003) found that Smurf1, a HECT domain E3 ubiquitin ligase,
regulated cell polarity and protrusive activity and was required to
maintain the transformed morphology and motility of a tumor cell.
Atypical protein kinase C-zeta (PKC2; 176982), an effector of the Cdc42
(116952)/Rac1 (602048)-PAR6 (607484) polarity complex, recruited Smurf1
to cellular protrusions, where it controlled the local level of RhoA
(165390). Smurf1 thus links the polarity complex to degradation of RhoA
in lamellipodia and filopodia to prevent RhoA signaling during dynamic
membrane movements.

Using RNA interference, Crose et al. (2009) showed that knockdown of
Ccm2 (607929) in mouse brain endothelial cells led to increased
monolayer permeability, decreased tubule formation, and reduced cell
migration following wounding. These effects were associated with
elevated levels of RhoA. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that
Ccm2 directly bound Smurf1. Domain analysis revealed that the PTB domain
of Ccm2 directly bound the HECT domain of Smurf1, and the interaction
targeted Smurf1 to Ccm2 complexes localized primarily at the cell
periphery. Coexpression of Ccm2 and Smurf1 led to cell rounding, likely
due to loss of RhoA. Crose et al. (2009) concluded that CCM2 contributes
to endothelial cell integrity by regulating SMURF1-directed RHOA
degradation

Orvedahl et al. (2011) performed a high-content, image-based, genomewide
small interfering RNA screen to detect genes required for the
colocalization of Sindbis virus capsid protein with autophagolysosomes.
They identified 141 candidate genes required for viral autophagy, which
were enriched for cellular pathways related to mRNA processing,
interferon signaling, vesicle trafficking, cytoskeletal motor function,
and metabolism. Ninety-six of these genes were also required for Parkin
(602544)-mediated mitophagy, indicating that common molecular
determinants may be involved in autophagic targeting of viral
nucleocapsids and autophagic targeting of damaged mitochondria. Murine
embryonic fibroblasts lacking one of these gene products, the C2
domain-containing protein SMURF1, are deficient in the autophagosomal
targeting of Sindbis and herpes simplex viruses and in the clearance of
damaged mitochondria. Moreover, SMURF1-deficient mice accumulated
damaged mitochondria in the heart, brain, and liver. Thus, Orvedahl et
al. (2011) concluded that their study identified candidate determinants
of selective autophagy, and defined SMURF1 as a mediator of both viral
autophagy and mitophagy.

MAPPING

Scott (2001) mapped the SMURF1 gene to 7q21.1-q31.1 based on sequence
similarity between the SMURF1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF199364) and
the chromosome 7 clone RP4-808A1 (GenBank GENBANK AC004893).

ANIMAL MODEL

Yamashita et al. (2005) found that Smurf1 -/- mice were born at the
expected mendelian ratio, developed normally, and were fertile, but
their bone mineral density increased with age due to enhanced osteoblast
activity. Osteoblast number appeared normal in Smurf1 -/- mice. Smurf1
-/- osteoblasts cultured from calvaria bones showed increased production
of collagen matrix and increased size and number of mineralized bone
nodules. Biochemical analysis revealed that Smurf1 promoted
ubiquitination and degradation of Mekk2 (MAP3K2; 609487), an upstream
kinase in the JNK (see 601158) signaling pathway. Loss of Smurf1
increased the sensitivity of Smurf1 -/- cells to BMP signaling.
Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed a direct interaction between
Smurf1 and Mekk2, and the interaction depended upon Mekk2
phosphorylation.

Guo et al. (2008) noted that transgenic mice overexpressing human TNF
(191160) exhibit reduced long bone volume, decreased mineralized bone
nodule formation, and arthritis. They showed that TNF overexpression
induced bone loss by increasing expression of Smurf1, resulting in
ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Smad1 and Runx2 (600211).
Deletion of Smurf1 in TNF-transgenic mice prevented systemic bone loss
and improved bone strength.

314998	TITLE *314998 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 81; ZNF81
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Marino et al. (1993) isolated a novel zinc finger protein gene (ZNF81)
from an X chromosome-specific library. The pattern of segregation in
human-hamster somatic cell hybrids with various deletions established
that the gene resides within the Xp22.1-p11 region.

MAPPING

Knight et al. (1994) confirmed the assignment to Xp22.11-p11.23 in a
region occupied also by ZNF21 (314993) and ZNF41 (314995) by
demonstrating that they were located in the same YAC contig spanning
approximately 1.5 Mb of DNA. The ELK1 gene (311040) was shown to be
linked to the PFC gene (300383), which had previously been shown to be
in a cluster with ARAF1 (311010), SYN1 (313440), and TIMP (305370); all
5 genes were contained within a distance of 120 kb. ZNF21 and ZNF81 lay
150 kb distal to the chromosomal breakpoint associated with synovial
sarcoma (312820).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kleefstra et al. (2004) characterized the breakpoints of a de novo
translocation, t(X;9)(p11.23;q34.3), in a female patient with severe
mental retardation and found that the translocation disrupted the ZNF81
gene. Mutation analysis in more than 300 families and patients with
nonspecific X-linked mental retardation revealed a ser179-to-asn
substitution (314998.0001) in ZNF81 in family MRX45 (300498), reported
by Hamel et al. (1999), that fully segregated with the phenotype.
Kleefstra et al. (2004) suggested that mutation in the ZNF81 gene may be
a rare cause of nonspecific X-linked mental retardation.

613599	TITLE *613599 ABHYDROLASE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 12; ABHD12
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The endocannabinoid lipid transmitter 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG)
acts on cannabinoid receptors CB1 (CNR1; 114610) and CB2 (CNR2; 605051)
and functions in synaptic plasticity and neuroinflammation. ABHD12
inactivates 2-AG by converting it into the metabolites arachidonate and
glycerol (Fiskerstrand et al., 2010).

CLONING

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 20 associated with
polyneuropathy, hearing loss, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, and cataract
(PHARC; 612674), Fiskerstrand et al. (2010) identified ABHD12. Abhd12
was expressed at variable levels in all mouse tissues examined, with
highest expression in microglia, followed by prostate and macrophages.
High expression was also detected in all mouse brain regions examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fiskerstrand et al. (2010) determined that the ABHD12 gene contains 13
coding exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Fiskerstrand et al. (2010) mapped the
ABHD12 gene to chromosome 20p11.21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 19 persons from 9 families from Norway, United Arab Emirates, United
States, and Algeria, with an autosomal recessive disorder characterized
by slowly progressive polyneuropathy, hearing loss, ataxia, retinitis
pigmentosa, and cataract (PHARC; 612674), Fiskerstrand et al. (2010)
identified 4 different homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the
ABHD12 gene (613599.0001-613599.0004). Common mutations were found in
families from Norway (613599.0001) and Algeria (613599.0003). All the
mutations were predicted to result in complete loss of enzyme function.
None of the patients had behavioral disturbances or appetite
abnormalities potentially related to increased levels of 2-AG. The
findings indicated that ABHD12 performs essential functions in the
central and peripheral nervous systems and the eye. Fiskerstrand et al.
(2010) noted that future drug-mediated interference with this enzyme to
treat neurodegenerative diseases must consider the potential risk of
long-term effects.

POLYNEUROPATHY, HEARING LOSS, ATAXIA, RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA, AND CATARACT
ABHD12, 2-BP DEL/3-BP INS, 337GA/TTT

In 8 affected members from 4 Norwegian families with polyneuropathy,
hearing loss, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, and cataract (PHARC;
612674), Fiskerstrand et al. (2010) identified a homozygous indel
mutation in exon 3 of the ABHD12 gene (337_338delGAinsTTT). The mutation
was predicted to result in a premature stop codon. Population-based
screening found that 2 of 190 healthy individuals were heterozygous
carriers of the mutation, resulting in an estimated incidence of 1 in
36,000 in this population. The phenotype was characterized by onset of
peripheral neuropathy in adulthood, although many had pes cavus,
decreased sensation, and sensorineural hearing loss from childhood. The
disorder was slowly progressive with retinitis pigmentosa and cataracts
developing in adulthood. Frank ataxia was variable and also showed a
later onset in adulthood.

In 3 affected members of a family from the United Arab Emirates with
polyneuropathy, hearing loss, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, and cataract
(612674), Fiskerstrand et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 14-kb
deletion and 2-bp insertion (del14007insGG) in the ABHD12 gene
encompassing the promoter region and exon 1 of the gene. Two patients
were in their twenties, and 1 was age 6 years. Common features included
absent tendon reflexes, hearing loss, ataxia, cataracts; hearing loss
occurred in childhood in all 3. Only the older 2 patients had retinitis
pigmentosa.

ABHD12, 7-BP DUP, NT846

In 7 patients from 4 Algerian families with PHARC (612674), Fiskerstrand
et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 7-bp duplication in exon 9 of the
ABHD12 gene (846_852dupTAAGAGC), resulting in a premature stop codon at
residue 285. The patients ranged in age from 10 to 44 years. The older
individuals were more severely affected. All patients had some evidence
of a polyneuropathy, with hyporeflexia, pes cavus, and/or sensory loss,
and most had gait ataxia with onset in the childhood. Four of the older
patients had hearing loss, but only 1 had retinitis pigmentosa and
cataract. Other common features included extensor plantar responses and
cerebellar atrophy.

ABHD12, ARG352TER

In a 50-year-old woman from the U.S., who was of French Canadian
descent, with PHARC (612674), Fiskerstrand et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 1054C-T transition in exon 12 of the ABHD12 gene, resulting
in an arg352-to-ter (R352X) substitution. She developed sensorineural
hearing loss at age 17 years, ataxia and dysarthria at 18, and retinitis
pigmentosa and cataracts in her twenties. She had pes cavus and
hammertoes, and a mild peripheral neuropathy when examined at age 34
years. She had myoclonic seizures, but cognition was not affected, and
the disease showed a slowly progressive course.

;;CYP7;;
CHOLESTEROL 7-ALPHA-HYDROXYLASE;;
CHOLESTEROL 7-ALPHA-MONOOXYGENASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase is a microsomal cytochrome P450 that
catalyzes the first step in bile acid synthesis.

CLONING

Noshiro and Okuda (1990) cloned human CYP7A1, using the rat homolog as
probe. The deduced 504-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 57.6 kD and contains putative heme and steroid-binding domains.
The human and rat proteins share 82% sequence identity.

GENE FUNCTION

By transfection of reporter constructs, mutation analysis, and DNase
footprinting, Molowa et al. (1992) identified areas of the CYP7A1
promoter region that showed hepatocyte-specific activation. They found
HNF3 (see 602294) to be an activator of CYP7A1 activity.

Nitta et al. (1999) identified a liver-specific regulatory element
within the CYP7A promoter and isolated a transcription factor, CPF (also
called LRH1 or NR5A2; 604453), that binds to the promoter of the human
CYP7A gene. Cotransfection of a CPF expression plasmid and a CYP7A
reporter gene resulted in specific induction of CYP7A-directed
transcription. These and other observations suggested that CPF is a key
regulator of human CYP7A gene expression in the liver.

In an elegant series of experiments designed to understand the effect of
retinoid X receptor (RXR; see 180245) activation on cholesterol balance,
Repa et al. (2000) treated animals with the rexinoid LG268. Animals
treated with rexinoid exhibited marked changes in cholesterol balance,
including inhibition of cholesterol absorption and repressed bile acid
synthesis. Studies with receptor-selective agonists revealed that
oxysterol receptors (LXRs, see 602423 and 600380) and the bile acid
receptor, FXR (603826), are the RXR heterodimeric partners that mediate
these effects by regulating expression of the reverse-cholesterol
transporter, ABC1 (600046), and the rate-limiting enzyme of bile acid
synthesis, CYP7A1, respectively. These RXR heterodimers serve as key
regulators in cholesterol homeostasis by governing reverse cholesterol
transport from peripheral tissues, bile acid synthesis in liver, and
cholesterol absorption in intestine. Activation of RXR/LXR heterodimers
inhibits cholesterol absorption by upregulation of ABC1 expression in
the small intestine. Activation of RXR/FXR heterodimers represses CYP7A1
expression and bile acid production, leading to a failure to solubilize
and absorb cholesterol. Studies have shown that RXR/FXR-mediated
repression of CYP7A1 is dominant over RXR/LXR-mediated induction of
CYP7A1, which explains why the rexinoid represses rather than activates
CYP7A1 (Lu et al., 2000). Activation of the LXR signaling pathway
results in the upregulation of ABC1 in peripheral cells, including
macrophages, to efflux free cholesterol for transport back to the liver
through high density lipoprotein, where it is converted to bile acids by
the LXR-mediated increase in CYP7A1 expression. Secretion of biliary
cholesterol in the presence of increased bile acid pools normally
results in enhanced reabsorption of cholesterol; however, with the
increased expression of ABC1 and efflux of cholesterol back into the
lumen, there is a reduction in cholesterol absorption and net excretion
of cholesterol and bile acid. Rexinoids therefore offer a novel class of
agents for treating elevated cholesterol.

Agellon et al. (2002) found that wildtype mice and mice transgenic for
human CYP7A1 respond differently to cholesterol feeding. Cholesterol
feeding stimulated Cyp7a1 mRNA abundance and enzymatic activity in
wildtype mice, but repressed human CYP7A1 mRNA and activity in
transgenic mice. In transfected hepatoma cells, cholesterol increased
mouse Cyp7a1 gene promoter activity, but had no effect on the human
CYYP7A1 gene promoter. By electrophoretic mobility shift assays, Agellon
et al. (2002) found interaction of LXR:RXR with the mouse promoter, but
no binding to the human promoter.

The catabolism of cholesterol into bile acids is regulated by oxysterols
and bile acids, which induce or repress transcription of the pathway's
rate-limiting enzyme, CYP7A1. The nuclear receptor LXR-alpha (LXRA, or
NR1H3; 602423) binds oxysterols and mediates feed-forward induction. Lu
et al. (2000) showed that repression is coordinately regulated by a
triumvirate of nuclear receptors, including the bile acid receptor, FXR;
the promoter-specific activator, LRH1; and the promoter-specific
repressor, SHP (NR0B2; 604630). Feedback repression of CYP7A1 is
accomplished by the binding of bile acids to FXR, which leads to
transcription of SHP. Elevated SHP protein then inactivates LRH1 by
forming a heterodimeric complex that leads to promoter-specific
repression of both CYP7A1 and SHP. These results revealed an elaborate
autoregulatory cascade mediated by nuclear receptors for the maintenance
of hepatic cholesterol catabolism.

Goodwin et al. (2000) used a potent, nonsteroidal FXR ligand to show
that FXR induces expression of SHP1, an atypical member of the nuclear
receptor family that lacks a DNA-binding domain. SHP1 represses
expression of CYP7A1 by inhibiting the activity of LRH1, an orphan
nuclear receptor that regulates CYP7A1 expression positively. This bile
acid-activated regulatory cascade provides a molecular basis for the
coordinate suppression of CYP7A1 and other genes involved in bile acid
biosynthesis.

Drover et al. (2002) examined the molecular basis by which
triiodothyronine (T3) regulates the human CYP7A1 promoter. T3 decreased
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity in hepatoma cells
cotransfected with a plasmid encoding the T3 receptor TR-alpha and a
chimeric gene containing nucleotides -372 to +61 of the human CYP7A1
gene fused to the CAT structural gene. DNase I footprinting revealed
that recombinant TR-alpha protected 2 regions in this segment of the
human CYP7A1 gene promoter. The binding was competed by oligonucleotides
bearing an idealized TR-alpha binding motif and abolished by mutation of
these elements. The results indicated that T3-dependent repression of
human CYP7A1 gene expression is mediated via a novel site in the human
CYP7A1 gene promoter.

Inborn errors in bile acid synthesis represent one category of metabolic
liver disease. Specific defects are recognized in the enzymes catalyzing
reactions responsible for changes to the steroid nucleus of cholesterol
and its intermediates in the pathway leading to the formation of cholic
and chenodeoxycholic acids: 3-beta-hydroxy-delta-5 ceroid
dehydrogenase/isomerase in neonatal giant cell hepatitis (231100) and
delta(4)-3-oxysteroid 5-beta-reductase in neonatal cholestatic hepatitis
(235555). Other specific defects have been identified in enzymes
catalyzing reactions responsible for changes to the side chain of
cholesterol and its intermediates in this pathway, e.g., sterol
27-hydroxylase in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (213700). These
familial conditions are clinically manifest as syndromes of progressive
cholestatic liver disease, neurologic disease, and fat-soluble vitamin
malabsorption. Early diagnosis is important because patients with these
disorders can be successfully treated by oral administration of cholic
acid; normalization in serum liver enzymes and bilirubin, and resolution
of the histologic lesion are consistent responses to bile acid therapy,
and the need for liver transplantation in most cases can be
circumvented. Recognition of defects in bile acid synthesis has relied
on mass spectrometric analysis of the urine and serum to establish an
absence or marked reduction in synthesis of the normal primary bile
acids, cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids, concomitant with the presence
of excessive amounts of atypical bile acids and sterols that are
synthesized as a consequence of the enzyme deficiency.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cohen et al. (1992) determined that the CYP7 gene spans 10 kb and
contains 6 exons. The exon-intron boundaries are completely conserved
between human and rat genes. Sequencing of the 5-prime flanking region
revealed consensus recognition sequences for a number of liver-specific
transcription factors.

Molowa et al. (1992) identified a TATA box and a modified CAAT box in
the promoter region of the CYP7 gene. They also identified a modified
sterol response element and 3 potential recognition sites for hepatocyte
nuclear factor-3 (HNF3A; 602294).

MAPPING

Using both mouse-human somatic cell hybrids and in situ chromosomal
hybridization, Cohen et al. (1992) mapped the CYP7 gene to 8q11-q12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Cohen et al. (1992) found 4 single-stranded conformation-dependent DNA
polymorphisms and an Alu sequence-related polymorphism in the CYP7 gene.
Of the 20 unrelated Caucasians analyzed, 80% were heterozygous for at
least one of these 5 polymorphisms. The localization and
characterization of the CYP7 gene as well as the identification of
polymorphisms provided molecular tools for investigating the role of the
gene in disorders of cholesterol and bile acid metabolism. Paumgartner
and Sauerbruch (1991) suggested that cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase is
a candidate for a defect in gallstone disease and Angelin et al. (1978,
1987) suggested that it might be involved in familial
hypertriglyceridemia. The central role of the enzyme in cholesterol
homeostasis renders the CYP7 gene a candidate for determination of both
primary hyper- and hypocholesterolemia.

Wang et al. (1998) investigated the relationship between plasma
concentrations of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) and 3 genes
with pivotal roles in LDL metabolism: the low density lipoprotein
receptor (LDLR; 606945), apolipoprotein B (APOB; 107730), and CYP7.
Their investigation involved sib-pair linkage analyses, variant
component linkage analyses, and association studies. Analysis of 150
nuclear families indicated statistically significant linkage between
plasma LDLC concentrations and CYP7, but not LDLR or APOB. Further
sib-pair analyses using individuals with high plasma LDLC concentrations
as probands indicated that the CYP7 locus is linked to high plasma LDLC,
but not to low plasma LDLC concentrations. This finding was replicated
in an independent sample. DNA sequencing revealed 2 linked polymorphisms
in the 5-prime flanking region of CYP7. The allele defined by these
polymorphisms was associated with increased plasma LDLC concentrations,
both in sib pairs and in unrelated individuals. Common polymorphisms in
LDLR and APOB account for little of the heritable variability in plasma
LDLC concentrations in the general population. On the other hand, the
findings of the study by Wang et al. (1998) indicate that polymorphisms
in CYP7 contribute to heritable variability in these concentrations.

Teslovich et al. (2010) performed a genomewide association study for
plasma lipids in more than 100,000 individuals of European ancestry and
reported 95 significantly associated loci (P = less than 5 x 10(-8)),
with 59 showing genomewide significant association with lipid traits for
the first time. The newly reported associations included SNPs near known
lipid regulators (e.g., CYP7A1; NPC1L1, 608010; and SCARB1, 601040) as
well as in scores of loci not previously implicated in lipoprotein
metabolism. The 95 loci contributed not only to normal variation in
lipid traits but also to extreme lipid phenotypes and had an impact on
lipid traits in 3 non-European populations (East Asians, South Asians,
and African Americans).

609787	TITLE *609787 UBIQUITIN-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; UBAP1
;;UBAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening the expression patterns of ESTs located in a region at
9p22-p21 undergoing loss of heterozygosity in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(NPC), Yang et al. (1999) identified an EST that is downregulated in
NPC. Using the clone for this EST and 5-prime RACE, Qian et al. (2001)
identified the full-length cDNA sequence, which they designated UBAP1.
The deduced 502-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular mass of 55
kD and contains 2 putative tandem UBA domains at the C terminus, a
coiled-coil domain, 2 possible N-glycosylation sites, 5 PKC
phosphorylation sites, 7 casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, and 3
N-myristoylation sites. Qian et al. (2001) also identified mouse Ubap1.
The human and mouse proteins share 90% sequence identity. Northern blot
analysis of human tissues detected ubiquitous expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript, with highest expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and
liver. RT-PCR of mouse tissues also revealed ubiquitous expression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using RT-PCR and direct sequencing, Qian et al. (2001) screened the NPC
cell line HNE1 and 10 primary NPCs for mutations in the UBAP1 gene. They
found no sequence alterations.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Qian et al. (2001) mapped the UBAP1 gene to
chromosome 9p22-p21.

;;SPFH DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; SPFH2;;
CHROMOSOME 8 OPEN READING FRAME 2; C8ORF2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, followed by PCR and RACE of adult and
fetal cDNA libraries, Ikegawa et al. (1999) cloned 2 splice variants of
ERLIN2, which they designated C8ORF2. The deduced 339- and 152-amino
acid proteins share the first 141 N-terminal amino acids, then diverge.
Both proteins have an N-glycosylation site and type-2 membrane topology,
and the longer protein has a lysine- and glutamic acid-rich region.
Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of 1.6- and 2.5-kb
transcripts; a minor 4.4-kb transcript was also observed.

Using monoclonal antibodies to human lipid raft proteins, Browman et al.
(2006) identified ERLIN1 (611604) and ERLIN2 as components of lipid
rafts. Immunohistochemical analysis of endogenous and
fluorescence-tagged proteins revealed that ERLIN1 and ERLIN2 localized
specifically to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope. The
2 proteins share 83% identity, and both contain a conserved prohibitin
(PHB; 176705) homology domain of about 160 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

The ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway removes aberrant proteins
and metabolically regulated native proteins from the ER. Pearce et al.
(2007) found that SPFH2 associated rapidly with activated IP3 receptors
(see IP3R1; 147265), which are substrates for the ERAD pathway, in
various mammalian cell lines. A proportion of SPFH2 associated with
several components of the ERAD pathway, and RNA interference-mediated
depletion of SPFH2 inhibited polyubiquitination and degradation of IP3R1
and turnover of model ERAD substrates. Pearce et al. (2007) concluded
that SPFH2 is a key ERAD pathway component that may act as a substrate
recognition factor.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ikegawa et al. (1999) determined that the ERLIN2 gene contains 16 exons
and spans more than 16.5 kb. The first 4 exons encode alternative
5-prime UTRs, exon 5 contains the initiating methionine, and exons 10
and 16 encode alternative 3-prime UTRs.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ikegawa et al. (1999) mapped the ERLIN2
gene to chromosome 8p11.2.

CYTOGENETICS

By autozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene sequencing in a
consanguineous Saudi family with complicated SPG18 (611225), Alazami et
al. (2011) identified a homozygous 20-kb deletion on chromosome 8, with
the distal breakpoint near physical position 37,694,857 (NCBI36) and the
proximal breakpoint near 37,714,575 immediately upstream of exon 2 of
the ERLIN2 gene. This 20-kb interval spans 2 protein-coding genes,
ERLIN2 and FLJ34378. RT-PCR analysis of patient lymphoblasts showed loss
of ERLIN2 transcription, consistent with a null allele. Alazami et al.
(2011) noted that ERLIN2 is involved in the endoplasmic
reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, and postulated that
loss of ERLIN2 may result in persistent activation of IP3 signaling and
neuronal channel activity since ERAD normally degrades IP3 receptors.
Alazami et al. (2011) concluded that ERLIN2 depletion caused the
phenotype, although they could not exclude a role for FLJ34378.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with autosomal
recessive spastic paraplegia-18 (SPG18; 611225), Yildirim et al. (2011)
identified a truncation mutation in the ERLIN2 gene (611605.0001) by
linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing. The authors
termed the disorder 'intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, and
contractures (IDMDC).' Affected individuals presented between ages 6
months and 2 years with an arrest and regression of motor function. They
developed progressive severe contractures of all joints, resulting in
severe motor disability and a fixed position. All had severe
intellectual disability, and none could speak, read, or write. Features
suggestive of spasticity included hyperactive reflexes, ankle clonus,
and extensor plantar responses, but the neurologic examination was
difficult to perform in most. Electron microscopy of white blood cells
from 2 affected sibs showed large membrane-bound vacuoles containing
flocculent material in 7 to 10% of cells, and these vacuoles appeared to
be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum.

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with autosomal

or spastic paraplegia-18 (SPG18; 611225), Yildirim et al. (2011)
identified a 2-bp insertion (812insAC) in exon 11 of the ERLIN2 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination in the
oligomerization domain. The protein was predicted to be truncated by
20%, but the mutant transcript did not appear to undergo
nonsense-mediated decay. The mutation was not found in 109 control
individuals.

601540	TITLE *601540 BROMODOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; BRD2
;;FEMALE STERILE HOMEOTIC-RELATED GENE 1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; FSRG1;;
RING3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BRD2 is a putative nuclear transcriptional regulator and a member of a
family of genes that are expressed during development.

CLONING

In a search for novel genes in the human major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class II region on chromosome 6p21.3, Okamoto et al.
(1991) and Beck et al. (1992) identified a gene that they termed RING3.
('RING' is an acronym for 'really interesting new gene.') Based on
mapping and genomic sequencing, RING3 was located in the middle of the
class II region between the genes HLA-DNA (142930) and HLA-DMA (142855).
In contrast to all the other genes encoded in the class II region, RING3
appeared to have no obvious function associated with the immune system
based on sequence comparisons. The striking sequence similarity to the
female sterile homeotic (fsh) gene in Drosophila, however, suggested a
conserved biologic function for RING3.

Denis and Green (1996) discovered that the RING3 product is, in fact, a
mitogen-activated nuclear kinase involved in signal transduction and
that it is upregulated in certain types of leukemia.

With the aim of learning more about the phylogeny of RING3, Thorpe et
al. (1996) identified further homologs in different species and
determined their gene structures. The functional analysis of RING3 had
been further complicated by the finding of a second, non-MHC-linked copy
of RING3 in humans by Nomura et al. (1994). This was referred to by them
as ORFX (601541).

GENE FUNCTION

Dawson et al. (2011) demonstrated that I-BET151, a novel small molecule
inhibitor of the BET family, of which BRD2 is a member, has profound
efficacy against human and murine MLL-fusion leukemia cell lines through
the induction of early cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. I-BET151
treatment in 2 human leukemia cell lines with different MLL fusions
altered the expression of a common set of genes whose function may
account for these phenotypic changes. The mode of action of I-BET151 is,
at least in part, due to the inhibition of transcription at key genes
BCL2 (151430), C-MYC (190080), and CDK6 (603368) through the
displacement of BRD3/4, PAFc, and SEC components from chromatin. In vivo
studies indicated that I-BET151 has significant therapeutic value,
providing survival benefit in 2 distinct mouse models of murine MLL-AF9
and human MLL-AF4 leukemia.

603473	TITLE *603473 LARGE TUMOR SUPPRESSOR, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; LATS1
DESCRIPTION In studies in Drosophila, Xu et al. (1995) used mosaic flies to screen
for tumor suppressors or negative regulators of cell proliferation. The
cellular composition of these flies resembled that of cancer patients
who are chimeric individuals carrying a small number of mutated somatic
cells. One of the genes they identified was the 'large tumor suppressor'
gene, lats (also known as wts), which encodes a putative
serine/threonine kinase. Somatic cells mutant for lats undergo extensive
proliferation and form large tumors in many tissues in mosaic adults.
Mutants homozygous for various lats alleles display a range of
developmental defects, including embryonic lethality. Although many
tumor suppressors were identified in Drosophila melanogaster, it was not
clear whether these fly genes were directly relevant to tumorigenesis in
mammals.

Tao et al. (1999) isolated mammalian homologs of Drosophila lats. Human
LATS1 and mouse Lats1 share 99% amino acid sequence identity in the
C-terminal kinase domain; human LATS1 and fly lats share 74% amino acid
sequence identity in this region. Northern blot analysis detected LATS1
expression in all fetal and adult tissues examined, with highest
expression in adult ovary. Human LATS1 suppressed tumor growth and
rescued all developmental defects, including embryonic lethality, in
flies. In mammalian cells, LATS1 was phosphorylated in a cell
cycle-dependent manner and complexed with CDC2 (116940) in early
mitosis. These and other biochemical observations indicated that LATS1
is a novel negative regulator of CDC2/cyclin A.

To elucidate further the function of mammalian LATS1, St. John et al.
(1999) generated Lats1 -/- mice. The homozygous deficient animals
exhibited a lack of mammary gland development, infertility, and growth
retardation. Accompanying these defects were hyperplastic changes in the
pituitary and decreased serum hormone levels. The reproductive hormone
defects of the homozygous deficient mice were reminiscent of isolated
LH-hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and corpus luteum insufficiency in
humans. Furthermore, the Lats1 -/- mice developed soft-tissue sarcomas
and ovarian stromal cell tumors and were highly sensitive to
carcinogenic treatments. The data demonstrated a role for LATS1 in
mammalian tumorigenesis and specific endocrine dysfunction. The
significance of the findings of Tao et al. (1999) and St. John et al.
(1999) were discussed by Kemp (1999).

;;C9ORF39;;
C9ORF101
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Makino et al. (2008) used ion exchange chromatography and tandem mass
spectrometry to study components of isolated centrosomes that
cosedimented with microtubules. They identified one of these components
as a 721-amino acid protein, called centlein, in rat brain. The protein
contains coiled-coil domains. Western blot analysis detected an
approximately 90-kD protein in all adult rat tissues tested and in
various cell lines. Transfection experiments in HeLa cells demonstrated
that centlein colocalizes with the centrosomal protein gamma-tubulin
(191135).

MAPPING

Scott (2008) mapped the CNTLN gene to chromosome 9p22.2 based on an
alignment of the CNTLN sequence (GenBank GENBANK AA492222) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

600027	TITLE *600027 SYNTROPHIN, BETA-2; SNTB2
;;SNT2B2;;
SYNTROPHIN-LIKE; SNTL
DESCRIPTION The syntrophin family of dystrophin (300377)-associated proteins
consists of 3 isoforms, alpha-1 (601017), beta-1 (600026), and beta-2,
each encoded by a distinct gene. Each syntrophin has approximately 50%
amino acid identity with the other 2. The 3 syntrophins can be separated
into 2 classes based on isoelectric point: the acidic isoform,
alpha-1-syntrophin (pI = 6.7) and the 2 basic forms, beta-1 and beta-2
(pI = 9.0). Adams et al. (1995) cloned the mouse beta-2-syntrophin gene,
which they found to be 33 kb long with 7 exons, all of which have
homologs at the corresponding position in the alpha-1-syntrophin gene.
Primer extension analysis revealed a single transcription initiation
site in the beta-2 gene.

Ahn et al. (1996) found that the deduced amino acid sequences of human
beta-2-syntrophin and alpha-1-syntrophin are nearly identical to their
homologs in mouse, suggesting a strong functional conservation among the
individual isoforms. Much like beta-1-syntrophin, human
beta-2-syntrophin has multiple transcript classes and is expressed
widely, although in a distinct pattern of relative abundance. In
contrast, human alpha-1-syntrophin is most abundant in heart and
skeletal muscle, and less so in other tissues.

By analysis of interspecific backcrosses, Adams et al. (1995) mapped the
mouse Sntb2 gene to chromosome 8. By Southern blot analysis of
hamster/human somatic cell hybrid DNAs, they mapped the human SNTB2 gene
to chromosome 16. By PCR analysis of somatic cell hybrids and
fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ahn et al. (1996) localized the
SNTB2 gene to 16q22-q23.

603249	TITLE *603249 NIPSNAP, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, 1; NIPSNAP1
;;4-@NITROPHENYLPHOSPHATASE DOMAIN AND NONNEURONAL SNAP25-LIKE 1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

A hypothetical protein encoded by C. elegans chromosome III contains a
4-nitrophenylphosphatase (NIP)-like domain and a nonneuronal SNAP25
(600322)-like domain flanking a central region. Seroussi et al. (1998)
stated that several lines of evidence suggest that these 3 domains are
encoded by a polycistronic operon rather than a single gene. They
designated the central domain NIPSNAP to reflect its position between
the NIP- and SNAP25-like regions. By sequence analysis of cloned genomic
DNA from 22q12 and of ESTs corresponding to that region, Seroussi et al.
(1998) identified a novel human gene encoding a protein with strong
sequence similarity to NIPSNAP. The predicted 284-amino acid protein,
which they called NIPSNAP1, shares 94% sequence identity with the mouse
ortholog, Nipsnap1. Northern blot analysis revealed that NIPSNAP1 is
expressed ubiquitously as a 2.1-kb mRNA, with the highest level in
liver. The authors determined that the NIPSNAP1 gene contains 10 exons
and spans 26 kb.

Using RT-PCR, Schoeber et al. (2008) detected variable Nipsnap1
expression in all mouse tissues examined except spleen.
Immunohistochemical analysis of kidney sections detected Nipsnap1 in the
inner medulla collecting ducts. Coprecipitation, protein pull-down, and
functional assays showed that Nipsnap1 interacted with Trpv6 (606680)
and regulated its channel activity. Electrophysiologic recordings
revealed that Nipsnap1 abolished Trpv6 currents, but it did not alter
the membrane localization of Trpv6.

MAPPING

Seroussi et al. (1998) found that the NIPSNAP1 gene is located between
the NF2 (607379) and PK1.3 (THOC5; 612733) genes on chromosome 22q12.

300522	TITLE *300522 IQ MOTIF- AND SEC7 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; IQSEC2
;;KIAA0522
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The IQSEC2 gene encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the ARF
family of GTP-binding proteins (see, e.g., ARF1; 103180) (Shoubridge et
al., 2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned IQSEC2, which they designated
KIAA0522. The deduced 1,560-amino acid protein shares weak homology with
rat Sec7a. RT-PCR detected high expression of IQSEC2 in brain, kidney,
and small intestine, and intermediate to low expression in placenta,
pancreas, ovary, prostate, and liver. No expression was detected in
other tissues examined.

Shoubridge et al. (2010) characterized 2 isoforms of the IQSEC2 gene
that are generated by alternative splicing. The longer isoform contains
15 exons and encodes a 1,488-residue protein, whereas the shorter
isoform contains 14 exons and encodes a 949-residue protein. The
proteins have 906 amino acids in common, which include the IQ, Sec7, and
PH functional domains, but vary at both the N and C termini. An
alternative transcript for the longer isoform, resulting in a
1,478-residue protein, was also proposed. Both the long and short
isoforms were expressed in fetal and adult human brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Filippova et al. (2005) determined that the mouse Iqsec2 gene is subject
to X inactivation, but human IQSEC2 escapes X inactivation. They
attributed this difference to the presence of a CTCF (604167)-binding
site at the 5-prime end of the upstream Jarid1c gene (314690) in mice
that is not present in humans.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the IQSEC2
gene to chromosome X. Filippova et al. (2005) noted that the mouse
Iqsec2 gene also maps to chromosome X. In both mice and humans, the
IQSEC2 gene lies between the JARID1C and SMC1A (300040) genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 4 unrelated families with X-linked nonsyndromic
mental retardation (MRX1; 309530), Shoubridge et al. (2010) identified 4
different hemizygous mutations in the IQSEC2 gene
(300522.0001-300522.0004). Some carrier females had learning
disabilities. The authors suggested that a defect in the GTP-binding
activity of mutant IQSEC2 may influence the regulation of actin
cytoskeleton organization and neuronal development in the brain.

resulting in an arg863-to-trp (R863W) substitution affecting a conserved
residue in the Sec7 domain. The mutation was not found in 1,310 control
individuals. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutant protein had significantly decreased GTP binding to ARF6 (600464)

gln801-to-pro (Q801P) substitution affecting a conserved residue in the
Sec7 domain. The mutation was not found in 1,310 control individuals. In

In affected members of a family with X-linked mental retardation
(309530), Shoubridge et al. (2010) identified a 2273G-A transition in
exon 5 of the IQSEC2 gene, resulting in an arg758-to-gln (R758Q)
substitution affecting a conserved residue in the Sec7 domain. The
mutation was not found in 1,310 control individuals. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the mutant protein had significantly
decreased GTP binding to ARF6 (600464) compared to wildtype.

In affected members of an Australian family with X-linked mental
retardation (309530), Shoubridge et al. (2010) identified a 1075C-T
transition in exon 4 of the IQSEC2 gene, resulting in an arg359-to-cys
(R359C) substitution affecting a conserved residue in the IQ-like
domain. The mutation was not found in 1,310 control individuals. In

603684	TITLE *603684 LIPASE, ENDOTHELIAL; LIPG
;;EL;;
ENDOTHELIAL CELL-DERIVED LIPASE; EDL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Endothelial lipase regulates the circulating level of high density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). It can also form a molecular bridge
between endothelial cells and lipoproteins or circulating macrophages
through interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans. This
nonenzymatic action can increase cellular lipoprotein uptake and
monocyte adhesion and contribute to atherosclerosis (summary by Ishida
et al., 2004).

CLONING

HDL-C levels are inversely associated with the risk of atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease. At least 50% of the variation in HDL cholesterol
levels is genetically determined. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL; 609708) and
hepatic lipase (HL, or LIPC; 151670), 2 members of the triacylglycerol
(TG) lipase family, both influence HDL metabolism, and the HL locus has
been associated with variation of HDL levels in humans. Jaye et al.
(1999) described the cloning and in vivo functional analysis of a novel
human TG lipase synthesized by endothelial cells in vitro, and thus
named endothelial lipase (EL). The EL protein sequence is 45%, 40%, and
27% identical to those of LPL, HL, and pancreatic lipase (PL),
respectively. Like other TG lipases, the EL protein commences with an
18-residue hydrophobic sequence characteristic of a secretory signal
peptide. The 482-amino acid sequence contains the characteristic GXSXG
lipase motif, a conserved catalytic triad, conserved heparin and
lipoprotein binding sites, and 5 potential N-linked glycosylation sites.
Cysteine residues, implicated in disulfide bonds necessary for enzymatic
activity of other TG lipases, are conserved. Unlike LPL and HL, EL has a
lid region of only 19 residues. The lid domain forms an amphipathic
helix covering the catalytic pocket of the enzyme and confers substrate
specificity to the enzymes of this family. Northern blot analysis
detected a 4.5-kb EL transcript in liver, lung, kidney, placenta, and
testis, but not in heart or skeletal muscle.

Using a PCR-based subtraction hybridization methodology, Hirata et al.
(1999) cloned human and mouse cDNA corresponding to the LIPG gene.
Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb mRNA in placenta, liver, lung,
ovary, thyroid, and testis. Expression was also seen in human umbilical
vein and coronary endothelial cells and murine yolk sac cells.

By searching for genes upregulated in human umbilical vein endothelial
cells, Ishida et al. (2004) cloned 2 splice variants of LIPG, which they
designated EDL2a and EDL2b. Both variants encode truncated proteins that
lack the first 80 amino acids of full-length LIPG, which the authors
called EDL1a. In addition, EDL2b also lacks a 74-amino acid region that
encodes a portion of the lid domain. RT-PCR confirmed expression of the
truncated isoforms in several human tissues and cultured cells. Western
blot analysis and immunofluorescence studies of stably transfected cells
indicated that both truncated variants localized to the cytosol, while
full-length LIPG was secreted into the culture medium.

GENE FUNCTION

Jaye et al. (1999) showed that EL has substantial phospholipase
activity, but less triglyceride lipase activity. Overexpression of EL in
mice reduced plasma concentration of HDL cholesterol and its major
protein, apolipoprotein A-1 (107680). The endothelial expression,
enzymatic profile and in vivo effects of EL suggested to Jaye et al.
(1999) that it may have a role in lipoprotein metabolism and vascular
biology.

Ishida et al. (2003) and Jin et al. (2003) found that a decrease in
endothelial lipase expression and activity, by gene deletion and
antibody inhibition, respectively, resulted in significant increases in
plasma HDL cholesterol particles in mice. The findings of both studies
showed that endothelial lipase is an important enzyme in the physiologic
regulation of HDL metabolism.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ishida et al. (2004) determined that the LIPG gene contains 11 exons and
spans about 71.4 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ishida et al. (2004) mapped the LIPG gene
to chromosome 18q21.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Yamakawa-Kobayashi et al. (2003) detected 2 common SNPs in the LIPG gene
associated with serum HDL-C levels in healthy school-aged children. The
data supported the hypothesis that variations in this gene are one of
the genetic determinants of HDL-C levels.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ishida et al. (2004) found that Lipg expression was increased in apoE
(107741) -/- mice, which were prone to the development of
atherosclerotic vascular disease compared with control mice.
Atherosclerotic lesions were markedly attenuated in apoE -/- Lipg -/-
double-knockout mice compared with apoE -/- single-knockout mice;
however, serum lipid profiling did not provide a clear mechanism for
this effect since both antiatherogenic HDL and atherogenic VLDL/LDL
levels were increased. Lipg was predominantly expressed by luminal
endothelial cells and by infiltrating monocytes/macrophages in
adventitia and atherosclerotic plaques. ApoE -/- Lipg -/- mice showed
reduced macrophage infiltration compared with apoE -/- animals. Ex vivo
adhesion assays revealed that monocyte/macrophage binding to apoE -/-
Lipg -/- aortic strips was significantly less than to strips from apoE
-/- mice. Heparin treatment significantly diminished the augmented cell
adhesion to aortic strips from apoE -/- mice, but not to those from apoE
-/- Lipg -/- mice, suggesting that upregulation of Lipg in aorta may
enhance cell adhesion to the vessel wall by interaction with heparan
sulfate proteoglycans.

606700	TITLE *606700 MIDNOLIN, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; MIDN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tsukahara et al. (2000) identified the murine Midn gene using a gene
trap method. By screening an embryonic mouse cDNA library, they obtained
Midn cDNA clones predicted to encode a 508-amino acid protein containing
a ubiquitin-like domain. Tsukahara et al. (2000) noted that 3 different
cDNAs are generated by alternative splicing. RT-PCR and whole-mount in
situ hybridization analyses detected strong expression of Midn during
embryogenesis in the mesencephalon from embryonic day 11.5 to 12.5. At
day 12.5, weaker and more widespread expression was detected in various
cell types. Northern blot analysis showed Midn expression in all adult
tissues tested, with high levels in heart, lung, liver, and kidney.
Tsukahara et al. (2000) localized Midn to the nucleus and nucleolus and
identified a C-terminal 28-amino acid peptide important for nucleolar
localization. They concluded that Midn is involved in the regulation of
genes related to neurogenesis in the nucleolus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsukahara et al. (2000) determined that the murine Midn gene contains 9
exons.

MAPPING

Scott (2002) mapped the human MIDN gene to chromosome 19 based on
similarity between the murine Midn sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB036882)
and a chromosome 19 clone (GenBank GENBANK AC004221).

;;LLGL;;
HUGL1;;
DLG4, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Strand et al. (1995) stated that in Drosophila more than 50 tumor
suppressor genes have been identified by mutations causing tissue
overgrowth during development (see 600723). Recessive mutations in these
genes interrupt the differentiation of primordial cells and result in
excessive cell proliferation. These malignancies occur in either the
presumptive adult optic centers of the larval brain, the imaginal discs,
or the hematopoietic organs. The development of the mutant animals is
arrested and they die as larvae or pseudopupae. Inactivation of the
tumor suppressor gene 'lethal(2) giant larvae' (D-lgl) of Drosophila
leads to malignant transformation of the presumptive adult optic centers
in the larval brain and tumors of the imaginal discs. These malignancies
result from the disorganization of a cytoskeletal network in which the
D-LGL protein participates. Strand et al. (1995) described the isolation
of a cDNA encoding the human homolog of the D-LGL gene, which they
designated HUGL. In Northern blots the cDNA recognized a 4.5-kb RNA
transcript. The HUGL gene (also symbolized LLGL) is expressed in brain,
kidney, and muscle but is barely seen in heart and placenta. The HUGL
cDNA has a long open reading frame with the potential to encode a
protein of 1,057 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 115
kD. To further substantiate and identify the HUGL protein, Strand et al.
(1995) prepared polyclonal rabbit antibodies against synthetic peptides
corresponding to the N and C termini of the predicted translation
product of the HUGL gene. The affinity-purified anti-HUGL antibodies
recognized a single protein with an apparent molecular weight of
approximately 115 kD. Similar to the Drosophila protein, HUGL is part of
a cytoskeletal network and is associated with nonmuscle myosin II heavy
chain (type A, 160775; type B, 160776) and a kinase that specifically
phosphorylates HUGL at serine residues.

Koyama et al. (1996) isolated cDNA clones from a human brain cDNA
library for the human homolog of the murine Llglh gene that was
originally isolated as a homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor gene
'lethal(2) giant larvae' (l(2)gl). The full-length cDNA encodes 1,033
amino acids with 40% identity to the Drosophila l(2)gl amino acid
sequence and 86% identity to the murine homolog. Northern analysis of
mRNA revealed that this gene was expressed as a 4.4-kb transcript in a
wide range of tissues; however, more abundant expression occurred in
brain and testes.

GENE FUNCTION

Ohshiro et al. (2000) demonstrated in Drosophila that lethal giant
larvae (Lgl) is essential for asymmetric cortical localization of all
basal determinants in mitotic neuroblasts, and is therefore
indispensable for neural fate decisions. Lgl, which itself is uniformly
cortical, interacts with several types of myosin to localize the
determinants. Another tumor suppressor protein, lethal discs large (Dlg)
(DLG1; 601014), participates in this process by regulating the
localization of Lgl. The localization of the apical components is
unaffected in Lgl or Dlg mutants. Thus, Lgl and Dlg act in a common
process that differentially mediates cortical protein targeting in
mitotic neuroblasts, and creates intrinsic differences between daughter
cells.

Peng et al. (2000) showed that the tumor suppressor genes Lgl and Dlg
regulate basal protein targeting, but not apical complex formation or
spindle orientation, in both embryonic and larval Drosophila
neuroblasts. Dlg protein is apically enriched and is required for
maintaining cortical localization of Lgl protein. Basal protein
targeting requires microfilament and myosin function, yet the Lgl
phenotype is strongly suppressed by reducing levels of myosin II. Peng
et al. (2000) concluded that Dlg and Lgl promote, and myosin II
inhibits, actomyosin-dependent basal protein targeting in neuroblasts.

Zarnescu et al. (2005) found that mouse Lgl was expressed at low levels
in the cytoplasm along with Fmr1 (309550). Overexpression of
fluorescence-tagged Fmr1 directed the assembly of endogenous Lgl into
perinuclear and cytoplasmic granules. In a mouse catecholaminergic cell
line, Fmr1 overexpression resulted in reorganization of endogenous Lgl
into Fmr1-containing granules in the perinuclear region and within
developing neurites.

Dollar et al. (2005) demonstrated that a vertebrate homolog of Lgl
associates with dishevelled (601365), an essential mediator of Wnt
signaling, and that dishevelled regulates the localization of Lgl in
Xenopus ectoderm and Drosophila follicular epithelium. Dollar et al.
(2005) showed that both Lgl and dishevelled are required for normal
apical-basal polarity of Xenopus ectodermal cells. In addition, Dollar
et al. (2005) showed that the Wnt receptor frizzled 8 (606146), but not
frizzled 7 (603410), causes Lgl to dissociate from the cortex with the
concomitant loss of its activity in vivo. Dollar et al. (2005) concluded
that their findings suggest a molecular basis for the regulation of cell
polarity by frizzled and dishevelled.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of DNA from rodent/human somatic cell hybrids
and by fluorescence in situ hybridization, Strand et al. (1995)
determined that the HUGL locus spans at least 25 kb on chromosome
17p12-p11.2 centromeric to the p53 gene (191170).

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Koyama et al. (1996) localized
the human gene to 17p11.2. They reported that in patients with
Smith-Magenis syndrome (182290) with microdeletions of chromosome
17p11.2, hybridization occurred only on one chromosome 17, i.e., on the
normal chromosome.

Campbell et al. (1997) reported that the LLGL1 gene is adjacent to FLII
(600362), and that the 3-prime ends of the 2 transcripts overlap. The
overlap region contains poly(A) signals for both genes and is highly
conserved between human and mouse.

ANIMAL MODEL

Klezovitch et al. (2004) found that loss of Lgl1 in mice resulted in
formation of neuroepithelial rosette-like structures, similar to the
neuroblastic rosettes in human primitive neuroectodermal tumors. Newborn
Lgl1 -/- pups developed severe hydrocephalus and died neonatally. A
large proportion of Lgl1 -/- neural progenitor cells failed to exit the
cell cycle and differentiate, and instead continued to proliferate and
died by apoptosis. Dividing Lgl1 -/- cells were unable to asymmetrically
localize the Notch inhibitor Numb (603728), and the resulting failure of
asymmetric cell divisions may have been responsible for the
hyperproliferation and lack of differentiation.

Lee et al. (2006) tested whether cell polarity genes, known to regulate
embryonic neuroblast asymmetric cell division, also regulate neuroblast
self-renewal. Clonal analysis in Drosophila larval brains showed that
pins (see 609245) mutant neuroblasts rapidly fail to self-renew, whereas
lgl mutant neuroblasts generate multiple neuroblasts. Notably, lgl pins
double mutant neuroblasts all divide symmetrically to self-renew,
filling the brain with neuroblasts at the expense of neurons. The lgl
pins neuroblasts show ectopic cortical localization of atypical protein
kinase C (aPKC; see 176960), and a decrease in aPKC expression reduces
neuroblast numbers, suggesting that aPKC promotes neuroblast
self-renewal. In support of this hypothesis, Lee et al. (2006) found
that neuroblast-specific overexpression of membrane-targeted aPKC, but
not a kinase-dead version, induced ectopic neuroblast self-renewal. Lee
et al. (2006) concluded that cortical aPKC kinase activity is a potent
inducer of neuroblast self-renewal.

600267	TITLE *600267 PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, NONRECEPTOR-TYPE, 13; PTPN13
;;PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE PTPL1;;
FAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE 1; FAP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a PCR-based approach, Saras et al. (1994) cloned a cytoplasmic
protein tyrosine phosphatase of nonreceptor type, which they designated
PTPL1. Overlapping cDNA clones encompassed an open reading frame of
7,398 bp, predicting a 2,466-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of
275 kD. PTPL1 was found to have a wide tissue distribution, a 9.5-kb
transcript being expressed in most tissues. PTPL1 has a protein-tyrosine
phosphatase domain located in the C terminus. In the nonenzymatic part
of PTPL1, 3 different structural motifs were identified; 2 of these are
often found in proteins at the interface between the plasma membrane and
the cytoskeleton, namely, a domain with similarity to the band 4.1
(130500) superfamily, and a region consisting of 5 copies of an 80-amino
acid repeat found in a variety of cytoskeleton-associated proteins. In
addition, PTPL1 has a leucine zipper motif. Saras et al. (1994) noted
that PTPL1 was the largest known PTP and the only one known to contain a
leucine zipper motif. Its structure suggests that it may be able to form
dimers and may localize to the submembranous cytoskeleton.

Both Banville et al. (1994) and Maekawa et al. (1994) isolated the same
nonreceptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase, PTPN13, which they
referred to as hPTP1E and PTP-BAS, respectively. Maekawa et al. (1994)
originally isolated a PCR product from basophil mRNA using degenerate
primers and RT-PCR. This was used as a probe to screen a
basophil-enriched KU812E cell cDNA library. The fully characterized cDNA
was over 8.1 kb and encoded a 2,485-amino acid predicted reading frame.
The Banville et al. (1994) cDNA was isolated by screening a ZR-75-1
breast carcinoma cell line at low stringency with a probe for LAR cDNA
(179590). The cDNA they identified was over 8.3 kb long and encoded a
2,490-amino acid reading frame. Both groups noted that the N-terminal
region contains motifs showing similarity to the GLGF motifs found in
guanylate kinase proteins that may play a role in the subcellular
distribution of these proteins within specialized structures of the cell
membrane where cell-cell interactions occur. Maekawa et al. (1994)
presented evidence for alternative splicing producing at least 3
different isoforms of PTPN13. Banville et al. (1994) expressed the
protein in E. coli and showed that the recombinant protein had the
expected protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity. Northern blot analysis
showed expression in a variety of tissues with especially high levels in
the kidney, lung, and fetal brain.

PTPN13 binds to a negative regulatory domain in Fas that inhibits
Fas-induced apoptosis; it has therefore also been called Fas-associated
protein-tyrosine-1 (FAP1) (Inazawa et al., 1996).

GENE STRUCTURE

Yoshida et al. (2002) determined that the PTPN13 gene is located only
633 bp upstream from JNK3 (602897) in a head-to-head orientation. A
short G/C-rich region between the cap sites of the 2 genes suggested
that they might share a bidirectional promoter region that appears to
contain multiple cis elements. They found that the PTPN13 gene, which
contains 48 exons, initiates transcription within exon 2 and terminates
in exon 48.

MAPPING

Banville et al. (1994) assigned the PTPN13 gene to chromosome 11 by PCR
of somatic cell hybrid DNAs. In an erratum, they stated that the gene
had been assigned to chromosome 4 and not 11 as reported.

Inazawa et al. (1996) localized the PTPN13 gene to 4q21.3 by both
fluorescence in situ hybridization and PCR analysis of somatic cell
hybrids. They noted that the 4q21.3 chromosomal region contains a gene
for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (173910) and is
frequently deleted in liver and ovarian cancers.

The assignment to 4q21 was confirmed by van den Maagdenberg et al.
(1996) who also mapped the gene to mouse chromosome 5.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wang et al. (2004) performed a mutational analysis of the tyrosine
phosphatase gene superfamily in human cancers and identified 83 somatic
mutations in 6 protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPRF, 179590; PTPRG,
176886; PTPRT, 608712; PTPN3, 176877; PTPN13; and PTPN14, 603155),
affecting 26% of colorectal cancers and a smaller fraction of lung,
breast, and gastric cancers. Fifteen mutations were nonsense,
frameshift, or splice site alterations predicted to result in truncated
proteins lacking phosphatase activity. Wang et al. (2004) biochemically
examined 5 missense mutations in PTPRT, the most commonly altered
protein-tyrosine phosphatase, and found that they reduced phosphatase
activity. Expression of wildtype but not a mutant PTPRT in human cancer
cells inhibited cell growth. Wang et al. (2004) concluded that their
observations suggested that the mutated tyrosine phosphatases are tumor
suppressor genes, regulating cellular pathways that may be amenable to
therapeutic intervention.

185641	TITLE *185641 MEDIATOR COMPLEX SUBUNIT 22; MED22
;;SURFEIT 5; SURF5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MED22, or SURF5, is a component of the Mediator complex, which is a
coactivator for DNA-binding factors that activate transcription via RNA
polymerase II (Sato et al., 2003). For background information on the
surfeit genes, see SURF1 (185620).

CLONING

Garson et al. (1996) stated that the mouse Surf5 protein contains 140
amino acids and is 98.5% identical to the human SURF5 protein. By
screening mouse brain and human fetal brain cDNA libraries, they cloned
a splice variant of SURF5 that they called SURF5B. Both mouse and human
SURF5B encode a deduced 200-amino acid protein that is identical to
SURF5 over the first 137 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected
Surf5 expression in all mouse tissues examined, whereas expression of
Surf5b was restricted to brain, heart, testis, and skeletal muscle. Both
mouse proteins were recovered in the cytoplasmic fraction of transfected
cells.

By PCR of a human teratocarcinoma cell line cDNA library, Angiolillo et
al. (2002) obtained 3 splice variants of SURF5. The longest cDNA,
SURF5a, encodes a deduced 140-amino acid protein with a calculated
molecular mass of 16.7 kD. SURF5b encodes a deduced 200-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 21 kD. The first 137 amino
acids of both proteins are identical. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected a 2.7-kb SURF5a transcript in all tissues and cell
lines examined. A 1.4-kb SURF5b transcript was detected only in heart,
brain, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, and in human teratocarcinoma
cells. Fluorescence-tagged SURF5a and SURF5b localized predominantly to
the cytoplasm of transfected HeLa cells.

Using HeLa cells overexpressing epitope-tagged MED10 (612382), Sato et
al. (2003) purified several components of the human Mediator complex,
including MED22, which they called SURF5, and subsequently cloned the
corresponding cDNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Garson et al. (1996) found that both mouse Surf5 and Surf5b were
expressed in undifferentiated mouse teratocarcinoma cells, but that
expression of Surf5b was upregulated 4-fold following their
differentiation into neuronal cells.

Using in vitro-translated epitope-tagged proteins for protein-binding
assays, Sato et al. (2003) found SURF5 directly interacted with the
Mediator complex subunits TRAP25 (MED30; 610237), HSPC296 (MED11;
612383), TRAP80 (MED17; 603810), and TRAP37 (MED27; 605044). Formation
of the SURF5-HSPC296 and SURF5-TRAP25 heterodimers were confirmed by
coimmunoprecipitation analysis of cotransfected insect cells and E.
coli, respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Angiolillo et al. (2002) determined that the MED22 gene contains 5 exons
and spans about 7.5 kb. The transcription start sites of the MED22 and
SURF3 (RPL7A; 185640) genes are separated by a 110-bp region that showed
bidirectional promoter activity. This promoter region lacks a TATA box
but is characterized by a CpG island that extends through the first exon
into the first intron of both genes.

MAPPING

By FISH analysis, Yon et al. (1993) identified the MED22 gene within the
surfeit gene cluster in chromosome 9q34.

608012	TITLE *608012 PROTEIN DISULFIDE ISOMERASE, FAMILY A, MEMBER 2; PDIA2
;;PROTEIN DISULFIDE ISOMERASE, PANCREATIC; PDIP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Protein disulfide isomerases (EC 5.3.4.1), such as PDIP, are endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) resident proteins that catalyze protein folding and
thiol-disulfide interchange reactions (Desilva et al., 1996).

CLONING

Desilva et al. (1996) cloned PDIP from an insulinoma subtraction cDNA
library. The deduced 511-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 56.6 kD and contains 2 thioredoxin (187700)-like catalytic
sites, a C-terminal ER retention sequence (KEEL), and 3 potential
N-glycosylation sites. PDIP shares about 46% identity with bovine,
mouse, rabbit, and human PDIs (176790). Northern blot analysis detected
a 2.0-kb transcript expressed exclusively in pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Desilva et al. (1996) determined that recombinant PDIP, expressed in E.
coli, catalyzed the reductive cleavage of radiolabeled insulin and
reactivated reduced RNase A.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, Desilva et al. (1996) mapped
the PDIP gene to chromosome 16p13.3.

142440	TITLE *142440 HEPSIN; HPN
;;TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEASE, SERINE 1; TMPRSS1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Hepsin is a cell surface serine protease.

CLONING

From cDNA libraries prepared from human liver and hepatoma cell line
mRNA, Leytus et al. (1988) isolated cDNA clones coding for a serine
protease called hepsin. The proteolytic enzymes of the serine protease
family exist as single- or 2-chain zymogenes that are activated by a
specific and limited proteolytic cleavage. They contain 3 principal
active-site amino acids, his, asp, and ser, that participate in peptide
bond hydrolysis. Among the best-studied serine proteases are those found
in plasma. These enzymes are involved in processes such as blood
coagulation, fibrinolysis, and complement activation. Tsuji et al.
(1991) showed that the hepsin mRNA is 1.85 kb in size and present in
most tissues, with the highest level in liver. It is present in the
plasma membrane in a molecular orientation of type II
membrane-associated proteins, with its catalytic subunit (C-terminal
half) at the cell surface and its N terminus facing the cytosol. Hepsin
is not found in cytosol. See also TMPRSS2 (602060), a related serine
protease.

MAPPING

Tsuji et al. (1991) mapped the hepsin gene to 19q11-q13.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Using cDNA microarrays, Dhanasekaran et al. (2001) examined gene
expression profiles of more than 50 normal and neoplastic prostate
specimens and 3 common prostate cancer cell lines. Signature expression
profiles of normal adjacent prostate, benign prostatic hypertrophy,
localized prostate cancer, and metastatic, hormone-refractory prostate
cancer were determined. Dhanasekaran et al. (2001) established many
associations between genes and prostate cancer. They assessed 2 of these
genes, hepsin, a transmembrane serine protease, and PIM1 (164960), a
serine/threonine kinase, at the protein level using tissue microarrays
consisting of over 700 clinically stratified prostate cancer specimens.
Expression of hepsin and PIM1 proteins was significantly correlated with
measures of clinical outcome.

In 3 different human cell lines, Guipponi et al. (2008) found that
TMPRSS1 was stably anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Since mutations in the TMPRSS3 gene (605511) cause a form of autosomal
recessive hearing loss (601072), Guipponi et al. (2008) systematically
investigated 16 TMPRSS genes as candidate genes for other forms of
hearing loss. No clear pathogenic mutations in the TMPRSS1 gene were
identified among 359 patients with sporadic hearing loss.

ANIMAL MODEL

To determine the functional importance of hepsin, Wu et al. (1998)
generated hepsin-deficient mice by homologous recombination. The
homozygous deficient mice were viable and fertile, and grew normally. In
functional assays, including tail bleeding time, plasma clotting times,
and tissue factor- or LPS-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation
models, no significant difference was found between hepsin -/- and
wildtype littermates. Liver weight and serum concentrations of
liver-derived proteins and enzymes were similar. Serum concentrations of
bone-derived alkaline phosphatase were approximately 2-fold higher in
hepsin -/- mice of both sexes when compared with wildtype littermates.
No obvious abnormalities were found in major organs in hepsin -/- mice
on histologic examination. The results indicated that hepsin is not
essential for embryonic development and normal hemostasis.

Guipponi et al. (2008) found that Tmprss1-null mice had poorly defined
or no auditory brainstem responses compared to wildtype mice at similar
decibel levels, indicating severe hearing impairment in the mutant mice.
Tmprss1 was found to be expressed in all inner ear tissues tested. The
protein was detected in spiral ganglion neurons but not in the organ of
Corti.

614783	TITLE *614783 POC1 CENTRIOLAR PROTEIN, CHLAMYDOMONAS, HOMOLOG OF, A; POC1A
;;PIX2;;
PROTEOME OF CENTRIOLE 1A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

POC1A and POC1B (614784) localize to centrioles and related structures
and appear to play roles in centriole duplication and/or maintenance
(Keller et al., 2009).

CLONING

By searching a human database for sequences similar to Xenopus Pix1,
Hames et al. (2008) identified POC1A, which they called PIX2, and
obtained the full-length cDNA clone. The deduced 407-amino acid PIX2
protein contains an N-terminal WD40 domain predicted to fold into a
7-bladed beta propeller and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. Variable
expression of PIX2 was detected in all human cell lines examined. Hames
et al. (2008) also identified Xenopus Pix2 and human PIX1 (POC1B) and 1
or 2 PIX orthologs in rodents, zebrafish, Drosophila, and amphioxus, but
not in C. elegans or yeast. Using an antibody that did not differentiate
between PIX1 and PIX2 for immunohistochemical analysis, Hames et al.
(2008) found that PIX associated with mitochondria, centrioles, and
basal bodies in human cell lines. Immunoelectron microscopic analysis of
human RPE1 retinal pigment epithelial cells revealed that PIX mostly
associated with the central region and distal end of the centriole
barrel, with concentration in the lumen. Epitope-tagged PIX1 and PIX2
were expressed in overlapping but distinct patterns in mitochondria,
centrosome, basal body, and spindle microtubules during the cell cycle
in transfected U2OS cells. Western blot analysis of several human cell
lines detected PIX2 at an apparent molecular mass of about 45 kD.

Shaheen et al. (2012) performed in situ hybridization on mouse embryos
at embryonic day 10.5 and quantitative RT-PCR on various mouse embryo
stages and adult tissues and found widespread expression of Poc1a.

EVOLUTION

Keller et al. (2009) stated that all organisms with standard triplet
microtubule-containing centrioles in at least part of their life cycle
have a POC1 gene. In vertebrates, the POC1 gene is duplicated.

MAPPING

Hames et al. (2008) stated that the human POC1A gene maps to chromosome
3p21.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Hames et al. (2008) found that epitope-tagged PIX2, and more weakly
PIX1, associated with microtubules in transfected HeLa cells. Inhibition
of PIX protein function via interfering antibodies disrupted cell
division in U2OS cells, resulting in a high proportion of cells that
were multinucleated or remained connected by a thin cytoplasmic bridge.

Shaheen et al. (2012) performed POC1A-knockdown experiments in
fibroblast cells using RNAi and demonstrated that POC1A deficiency
causes a severe ciliogenesis defect. A supernumerary centriole
phenotype, similar to that of a patient with a nonsense mutation in
POC1A (614783.0001), was observed in cells in which there was highly
efficient but low-frequency (5%) knockdown of POC1A.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 5 children with primordial dwarfism and distinctive facial features
(SOFT syndrome; 614813) from 3 consanguineous Saudi families, Shaheen et
al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a nonsense mutation in the POC1A
gene (R81X; 614783.0001). Cells derived from the index patient had
abnormal mitotic mechanics with multipolar spindles, in addition to
clearly impaired ciliogenesis, and RNAi knockdown of POC1A in
fibroblasts recapitulated this ciliogenesis defect.

In 2 consanguineous Israeli families of Arab Muslim origin segregating
autosomal recessive short stature, onychodysplasia, facial dysmorphism,
and hypotrichosis, Sarig et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a
missense mutation in the POC1A gene (L171P; 614783.0002) that segregated
with disease in both families and was not found in 300
population-matched controls. Functional analysis showed that the mutant
protein results in centrosome disorganization and an increase in
centrosome number, which is associated with abnormal trafficking from
the plasma membrane to the Golgi.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SHORT STATURE, ONYCHODYSPLASIA, FACIAL DYSMORPHISM, AND HYPOTRICHOSIS
POC1A, ARG81TER

In 5 children with primordial dwarfism and distinctive facial features
(SOFT syndrome; 614813) from 3 consanguineous Saudi families, Shaheen et
al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a 241C-T transition in exon 3 of
the POC1A gene, resulting in an arg81-to-ter (R81X) substitution.
Metaphase-stage fibroblast cells from the index patient showed
multipolar spindle formation at a frequency of 20% and supernumerary
centrioles at a frequency of 13%, whereas neither was observed in
control cells. In addition, control fibroblasts were almost uniformly
capable of forming normal cilia after serum starvation, whereas patient
fibroblasts were severely deficient in that regard (70% reduction).
Cilia from patient fibroblasts were also significantly shorter than
cilia from control cells.

.0002
SHORT STATURE, ONYCHODYSPLASIA, FACIAL DYSMORPHISM, AND HYPOTRICHOSIS
POC1A, LEU171PRO

In 8 affected members of 2 consanguineous Israeli families of Arab
Muslim origin with short stature, onychodysplasia, facial dysmorphism,
and hypotrichosis (614813), originally described by Shalev et al.
(2012), Sarig et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a 512T-C
transition in the POC1A gene, resulting in a leu171-to-pro (L171P)
substitution at a highly conserved residue. The mutation segregated with
disease in both families and was not found in 300 population-matched
controls. Analysis of patient fibroblasts showed that although
centrosomal structure was preserved, the number of centrosomes was
increased and their distribution was abnormal compared to controls. In
addition, the Golgi apparatus presented a dispersed morphology,
cholera-toxin trafficking from the plasma membrane to the Golgi was
aberrant, and large vesicles accumulated in the cytosol.

600491	TITLE *600491 MICROFIBRILLAR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 3; MFAP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Microfibrils of diameter 10-12 nm are found either in association with
elastin (130160) or independently and are an important component of the
extracellular matrix of many tissues. The proteins composing the
microfibrils are distinct from elastin. The largest and possibly the
most important of these are the fibrillins, 350-kD glycoproteins that
form integral parts of the microfibril structure; see fibrillin-1 (FBN1;
134797). Another component of microfibrils is microfibrillar-associated
protein-2 (MFAP2; 156790). Other proteins localized to the elastic fiber
microfibrils include the enzyme lysyl oxidase (LOX; 153455) and
microfibrillar-associated protein-1 (MFAP1; 600215). Abrams et al.
(1995) cloned and characterized microfibrillar-associated protein-3
(MFAP3). Monospecific antibodies prepared against the recombinant
expressed protein reacted with the microfibrils found in ocular zonules.

MAPPING

Abrams et al. (1995) localized the MFAP3 gene to chromosome 5q32-q33.3
by Southern analysis of a hybrid cell panel containing deletions or
translocations involving chromosome 5. The location was near the locus
5q21-q31 reported for the fibrillin-2 gene (FBN2; 612570), but clearly
mapped to a different region inasmuch as the FBN2 locus was not present
in hybrid cells containing the MFAP3 gene.

615143	TITLE *615143 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 20; USP20
;;VHL-INTERACTING DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME 2; VDU2;;
KIAA1003
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Deubiquitinating enzymes (EC 3.4.19.12), such as USP20, remove ubiquitin
peptides from ubiquitin-containing substrates. These enzymes have a
major role in rescuing ubiquitinated proteins from proteasome-mediated
degradation (Curcio-Morelli et al., 2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned USP20, which they designated
KIAA1003. The deduced 913-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with chicken Ubp41 (USP2; 604725). RT-PCR ELISA detected
relatively low USP20 expression in all adult and fetal tissues examined,
except spleen, which showed no USP20 expression. Highest levels were in
adult brain and ovary.

By searching databases for sequences similar to human VDU1 (USP33;
615146), followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE and PCR, Li et al. (2002)
cloned full-length human USP20, which they called VDU2. The deduced
protein contains 913 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of
102 kD. Human and mouse VDU2 share 92% amino acid identity, and human
VDU2 shares 59% amino acid identity with the human VDU1 type II isoform,
with strongest homology at the N- and C-terminal ends. VDU2 has 2 UCH
domains, which are crucial for deubiquitinating activity. Northern blot
analysis detected a 4.5-kb VDU2 transcript in all human tissues
examined, including brain, heart, placenta, lung, liver, muscle, kidney,
and pancreas.

By subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence analysis,
Curcio-Morelli et al. (2003) found that both epitope-tagged VDU1 and
VDU2 localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in transfected HEK
cells.

By database analysis, Thorne et al. (2011) identified 3 USP20 variants
that encode the same protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vivo and in vitro deubiquitination assays, Li et al. (2002)
showed that human VDU2 exhibited ubiquitin cleavage activity. They found
that human VDU1 and VDU2 competitively interacted with the E3 ubiquitin
ligase VHL (608537), resulting in ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated
degradation of both proteins.

Type II iodothyronine deiodinase (D2, or DIO2; 601413) converts
thyroxine into biologically active triiodothyronine (T3). T3 production
is terminated via ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of
D2. By coimmunoprecipitation analysis in transfected HEK293 cells,
Curcio-Morelli et al. (2003) found that both VDU1 and VDU2 bound D2.
Both VDU enzymes colocalized with D2 in the ER and reduced
ubiquitination and degradation of D2. Expression of Vdu1, but not Vdu2,
increased in mouse brown adipocytes following exposure to cold or
norepinephrine. Curcio-Morelli et al. (2003) concluded that VDU enzymes
recycle inactive ubiquitinated D2 to its active deubiquitinated form and
thereby regulate the supply of active thyroid hormone.

Thorne et al. (2011) found that knockdown of USP20 in HeLa cells
resulted in compensatory upregulation of USP33 expression.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the USP20 gene
to chromosome 9.

Hartz (2013) mapped the USP20 gene to chromosome 9q34.11 based on an
alignment of the USP20 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB023220) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

611005	TITLE *611005 MEX3, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, C; MEX3C
;;RING FINGER- AND KH DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; RKHD2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 18 linked to essential
hypertension (HYT8; 611014), Guzman et al. (2006) identified RKHD2
(MEX3C). The deduced protein contains a RING-type zinc finger domain and
a ribonucleoprotein K (HNRNPK; 600712) homology (KH) domain. Microarray
data showed that RKHD2 was expressed in most tissues and cell lines
analyzed.

C. elegans Mex3 is a regulator of translation that specifies posterior
blastomere identity in the early embryo and contributes to the
maintenance of germline totipotency. By database analysis and RT-PCR,
Buchet-Poyau et al. (2007) cloned a family of 4 human genes homologous
to C. elegans Mex3, including MEX3C. Like the other human MEX3 proteins,
the deduced 659-amino acid MEX3C protein has an N-terminal nuclear
export signal (NES), 2 KH domains, and a C-terminal RING finger domain.
The KH domains are present in C. elegans Mex3, but not the RING domain.
MEX3C also has a C-terminal nuclear localization signal. RT-PCR detected
variable expression of MEX3C in human tissues and cell lines, with
highest expression in testis.

Jiao et al. (2012) cloned mouse Mex3c, which encodes a deduced 464-amino
acid protein with 2 KH domains and a C-terminal zinc finger domain.
Database analysis revealed a splice variant of Mex3c that encodes a
deduced 653-amino acid protein with an N-terminal extension compared
with the shorter isoform. Mex3c was expressed in mouse testis, ovary,
brain, lung, and developing tibia, with lower expression in other
internal organs. It was also expressed in resting and proliferating
chondrocytes,

GENE FUNCTION

Using Western blot analysis of transfected human embryonic kidney cells
and kinase assays, Buchet-Poyau et al. (2007) showed that MEX3A
(611007), MEX3B (611008), and MEX3C were phosphoproteins. RNA
homopolymer-binding assays and immunoprecipitation analysis revealed
that MEX3A, MEX3B, and MEX3C bound RNA via their KH domains in vitro and
in vivo. Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected breast cancer cells
showed that MEX3A, MEX3B, and MEX3C shuttled between the nucleus and
cytoplasm in an NES-dependent manner.

Jiao et al. (2012) showed that mouse Mex3c bound multiple mRNA species.

Burrell et al. (2013) found evidence for impaired replication fork
progression and increased DNA replication stress in cancer chromosomal
instability (CIN)+ colorectal cancer cells relative to CIN- colorectal
cancer cells, with structural chromosome abnormalities precipitating
chromosome missegregation in mitosis. Burrell et al. (2013) identified 3
CIN suppressor genes (PIGN, 606097; MEX3C; and ZNF516, 615114) encoded
on chromosome 18q that are subject to frequent copy number loss in CIN+
colorectal cancer cells. Chromosome 18q loss was temporally associated
with aneuploidy onset at the adenoma-carcinoma transition. CIN
suppressor gene silencing led to DNA replication stress, structural
chromosome abnormalities, and chromosome missegregation. Supplementing
cells with nucleosides, to alleviate replication-associated damage,
reduced the frequency of chromosome segregation errors after CIN
suppressor gene silencing, and attenuated segregation errors and DNA
damage in CIN+ cells. Burrell et al. (2013) concluded that their data
implicated a central role for replication stress in the generation of
structural and numerical CIN.

GENE STRUCTURE

Guzman et al. (2006) determined that the MEX3C gene contains 2 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Guzman et al. (2006) mapped the MEX3C gene
to chromosome 18q21.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of an association between variation in the MEX3C gene and
susceptibility to hypertension, see HYT8 (611014).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a gene trap approach, Jiao et al. (2012) created mutant mice with
significant reduction in Mex3c expression. Homozygous gene trap mice
(tr/tr) showed about 2% residual Mex3c expression compared with
wildtype. Mex3c tr/tr embryos developed normally, but they showed
variable perinatal lethality depending on the genetic background. The
more susceptible Mex3c tr/tr strains died shortly after birth due to
respiratory distress, with poor expansion of alveolar spaces. More
resistant Mex3c tr/tr strains had a lower rate of mortality and were
fertile, but they were growth retarded and had reduced fat deposit,
likely due to elevated energy expenditure. Mex3c tr/tr mice had reduced
serum and bone Igf1 (147440) protein concentrations. Tissue Igf1 mRNA
content was normal, suggesting a defect in Igf1 translation in Mex3c
tr/tr mice.

611239	TITLE *611239 G PROTEIN-REGULATED INDUCER OF NEURITE OUTGROWTH 1; GPRIN1
;;GRIN1;;
KIAA1893
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chen et al. (1999) cloned mouse Gprin1, which they called Grin1. By
database analysis, they identified human GPRIN1. Northern blot analysis
of human brain regions showed wide distribution in brain tissue and the
central nervous system with highest expression in the spinal cord.
Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected expression in brain
only, and Western analysis detected protein in mouse neuroblastoma and
rat pheochromocytoma cells. Using immunofluorescence studies and Western
analysis of cell fractions, the authors found that both GPRIN1 and GNAO1
(139311) are membrane-bound proteins that are enriched in the growth
cones of neurites.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned GPRIN1, which they designated
KIAA1893. The deduced 800-amino acid protein shares 46% amino acid
identity with its mouse homolog. RT-PCR ELISA of human tissues detected
moderate expression in brain, with low expression in lung and spleen.
RT-PCR ELISA of specific brain regions detected high expression in
cerebellum, followed by amygdala, hippocampus, substantia nigra, caudate
nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, thalamus, and spinal cord, with low
expression in corpus callosum.

Iida and Kozasa, 2004 noted that the deduced 856-amino acid GPRIN1
sequence shares high homology with GPRIN2 (611240) and GPRIN3 (611241)
over the C-terminal region.

GENE FUNCTION

Using purified recombinant GPRIN1 and GPRIN2 expressed in insect cells,
as well as immunoprecipitation studies from transfected COS cells, Chen
et al. (1999) showed that both GPRIN1 and GPRIN2 interacted specifically
with G-alpha-o and G-alpha-z (GNAZ; 139160) bound to GTP-gamma-S or
GDP-AlF4(-), but did not interact with GDP-bound forms of either G
protein subunit. Chen et al. (1999) showed that coexpression of GPRIN1
or GPRIN2 with activated G-alpha-o caused formation and extension of
neurite-like processes in mouse neuroblastoma cells.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the GPRIN1 gene to
chromosome 5.

DRUG-INDUCED LIVER INJURY DUE TO FLUCLOXACILLIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION For background information on the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
and human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), see HLA-A (142800).

MAPPING

Cann et al. (1983) found a restriction fragment that segregated with
HLA-B8. Either the fragment carried the B8 specificity or represented
another class I gene (or pseudogene) in linkage disequilibrium with
HLA-B8.

Dunham et al. (1987) used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and 'cosmid
walking' to establish a molecular map of the MHC region. They concluded
that the MHC spans 3,800 kb. The HLA-B locus lies about 250 kb on the
telomeric side of the tumor necrosis factor genes (see TNFA; 191160).

Spies et al. (1989) found that the HLA-B gene is 210 kb from the TNFA
and TNFB (153440) genes. The class III gene C2 is separated from the
HLA-B gene by 600 kb.

Spies et al. (1989) concluded that a 600-kb DNA segment between C2 and
HLA-B contains a minimum of 19 genes. In addition to BAT1 (142560)
through BAT5 (142620), which had been localized to the vicinity of the
TNFA and TNFB genes, 4 genes, called BAT6 through BAT9, were mapped near
C2 within a 120-kb region that also includes a pair of heat-shock
protein genes (see 140550). A large number of BssHII and SacII
restriction sites, known to indicate the presence of multiple islands of
CPG-rich sequences and in turn the association of expressed genes,
occurred within 140 kb of DNA upstream from C2. In contrast, no gene was
found within the 175-kb interval between BAT1 and HLA-B, which is
relatively devoid of CPG-rich sequences.

Bronson et al. (1991) isolated yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones
carrying the HLA-B and HLA-C (142840) genes. The loci were found to be
located about 85 kb apart, each in close association with a CpG island.

GENE FUNCTION

Fleischhauer et al. (1990) demonstrated that a single amino acid
difference in the HLA-B molecule is sufficient for the development of
alloreactivity in vivo. They reported the case of a 29-year-old man with
chronic myelogenous leukemia who received a bone marrow transplant from
an unrelated female donor who was serologically HLA identical and
compatible in mixed lymphocyte culture. However, they differed with
respect to HLA-B44 subtypes B44.1 and B44.2, which were distinguishable
by their characteristic band patterns in isoelectric-focusing (IEF) gel
electrophoresis. The IEF difference, based on differences in charged
amino acids, was found to be due to leucine versus aspartic acid at
position 156.

Leinders-Zufall et al. (2004) showed that small peptides that serve as
ligands for MHC class I molecules function also as sensory stimuli for a
subset of vomeronasal sensory neurons located in the basal G-alpha-o-
(139311) and V2R receptor (see 605234)-expressing zone of the
vomeronasal epithelium. In behaving mice, the same peptides function as
individuality signals underlying mate recognition in the context of
pregnancy block. MHC peptides constitute a previously unknown family of
chemosensory stimuli by which MHC genotypic diversity can influence
social behavior.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Association With Protection From Severe Malaria

By means of a large case-controlled study of malaria (see 611162) in
West African children, Hill et al. (1991) showed that HLA-Bw53 and the
HLA class II haplotype, DRB1*1302/DQB1*0501, (see HLA-DRB1, 142857) are
independently associated with protection from severe malaria. The
antigens listed are common in West Africans but rare in other racial
groups. In this population, they account for as great a reduction in
disease incidence as the sickle-cell hemoglobin variant. Although the
relative strength of the protection is less than that of the sickle-cell
variant, the greater frequency of the DQB1 (see HLA-DQB1, 604305)
polymorphism makes the net effect on resistance to malaria comparable.
The findings support the hypothesis that the extraordinary polymorphism
of major histocompatibility complex genes has evolved primarily through
natural selection by infectious pathogens.

Hill et al. (1992) further investigated the protective association
between HLA-B53 and severe malaria by sequencing peptides eluted from
this molecule followed by screening of candidate epitopes from
pre-erythrocytic-stage antigens of Plasmodium falciparum in biochemical
and cellular assays. Among malaria-immune Africans, they found that
HLA-B53-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognized a conserved
nonamer peptide from liver-stage-specific antigen-1 (LSA-1), but no
HLA-B53-restricted epitopes were identified in other malaria antigens.
The findings of this 'reverse immunogenetic' approach indicated a
possible molecular basis for this HLA-disease association and supported
the candidacy of LSA-1 as a component for a malaria vaccine.

- Association With HIV-1 Disease Progression

Carrington et al. (1999) reported that the extended survival of 28 to
40% of HIV-1-infected Caucasian patients who avoided AIDS for 10 or more
years (see 609423) could be attributed to their being fully heterozygous
at HLA class I loci, to lacking the AIDS-associated alleles B*35 and
Cw*04, or to both.

Gao et al. (2001) examined subtypes of HLA-B*35 in 5 cohorts and
analyzed the relation of structural differences between subtypes to the
risk of progression to AIDS. Two subtypes were identified according to
peptide-binding specificity: the HLA-B*35-PY group, which consists
primarily of HLA-B*3501 and binds epitopes with proline in position 2
and tyrosine in position 9; and the more broadly reactive HLA-B*35-Px
group, which also binds epitopes with proline in position 2 but combines
several different amino acids (not including tyrosine) in position 9.
The influence of HLA-B*35 in accelerating progression to AIDS was
completely attributable to HLA-B*35-Px alleles, some of which differ
from HLA-B*35-Py alleles by only 1 amino acid residue. Gao et al. (2001)
concluded that the previously observed association of HLA-Cw*04 with
progression to AIDS was due to its linkage disequilibrium with
HLA-B*35-Px alleles. The fact that the association with B*35-Px was
observed in both blacks and whites supported the hypothesis that these
HLA-B alleles exert an effect on the immune response to HIV-1 infection.

Gao et al. (2005) found that HLA-B alleles acted during distinct
intervals after HIV infection. HLA-B35-Px and HLA-B57 were associated
with rate of progression to 4 outcomes: (1) progression to CD4+ T cells
less than 200 (CD4 less than 200), (2) CD4 less than 200 and/or an
AIDS-defining illness, (3) an AIDS-defining illness, and (4) death.
HLA-B27 (142830.0001), on the other hand, was only associated with the
last 3 outcomes. Protection mediated by HLA-B57 occurred early after
infection, whereas HLA-B27-mediated protection instead delayed
progression to an AIDS-defining illness after the decline in CD4 counts.
HLA-B35-Px showed an early susceptibility effect associated with rapid
progression from seroconversion to CD4 less than 200. Gao et al. (2005)
proposed that the presence of the various HLA-B alleles may lead to
different scenarios for viral escape from cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
pressure and virus subtypes with different fitnesses.

Martin et al. (2002) reported that the activating KIR allele KIR3DS1
(604946), in combination with HLA-B alleles that encode molecules with
isoleucine at position 80 (HLA-B Bw4-80Ile), is associated with delayed
progression to AIDS in individuals infected with HIV-1 (604946.0001). In
the absence of KIR3DS1, the HLA-B Bw4-80Ile allele was not associated
with any of the AIDS outcomes measured. By contrast, in the absence of
HLA-B Bw4-80Ile alleles, KIR3DS1 was significantly associated with more
rapid progression to AIDS. These observations strongly suggested a model
involving an epistatic interaction between the 2 loci. The strongest
synergistic effect of these loci was on progression to depletion of CD4+
T cells, which suggested that a protective response of NK cells
involving KIR3DS1 and its HLA class I ligands begins soon after HIV-1
infection.

Kiepiela et al. (2004) performed a comprehensive analysis of class I
restricted CD8+ T cell responses against HIV-1, immune control of which
depended upon virus-specific CD8+ T cell activity. In 375 HIV-1 infected
study subjects from southern Africa, a significantly greater number of
CD8+ T cell responses were HLA-B restricted compared to HLA-A (142800)
(2.5-fold; P = 0.0033). Kiepiela et al. (2004) showed that variation in
viral set point, in absolute CD4 count and, by inference, in rate of
disease progression in the cohort, was strongly associated with
particular HLA-B but not HLA-A allele expression (P less than 0.0001 and
P = 0.91, respectively). Moreover, substantially greater selection
pressure was imposed on HIV-1 by HLA-B alleles than by HLA-A (4.4-fold,
P = 0.0003). Kiepiela et al. (2004) concluded that their data indicated
that the principal focus of HIV-specific activity is at the HLA-B locus.
Furthermore, HLA-B gene frequencies in the population are those likely
to be most influenced by HIV disease, consistent with the observation
that B alleles evolve more rapidly than A alleles.

By testing the effects on HIV disease progression and viral load of
inhibitory KIR3DL1 subtypes in combination with HLA-B allelic groups,
Martin et al. (2007) determined that highly expressed, highly inhibitory
KIR3DL1*h alleles strongly enhance protection conferred by HLA-Bw4-80Ile
alleles, including HLA-B*57. Martin et al. (2007) proposed that greater
dependency on the expression of specific KIR3DL1-Bw4 receptor-ligand
pairs for NK cell inhibition in the resting state results in more
pronounced NK cell responses when the inhibition is abrogated in the
face of infection.

To define host genetic effects on the outcome of a chronic viral
infection, The International HIV Controllers Study (2010) performed
genomewide association analysis in a multiethnic cohort of HIV-1
controllers and progressors, and analyzed the effects of individual
amino acids within the classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins.
The International HIV Controllers Study (2010) identified more than 300
genomewide significant SNPs within the MHC and none elsewhere. Specific
amino acids in the HLA-B peptide binding groove, at positions 62, 63,
67, 70, and 97, as well as an independent HLA-C effect, explained the
SNP associations and reconciled both protective and risk HLA alleles.
The International HIV Controllers Study (2010) concluded that their
results implicated the nature of the HLA-viral peptide interaction as
the major factor modulating durable control of HIV infection.

- Association With Abacavir Hypersensitivity

Abacavir is a commonly used nucleoside analog with potent antiviral
activity against HIV-1. Approximately 5 to 9% of patients treated with
abacavir develop a hypersensitivity reaction characterized by
multisystem involvement that can be fatal in rare cases (Mallal et al.,
2002; Hetherington et al., 2002). Symptoms usually appear within the
first 6 weeks of treatment and include fever, rash, gastrointestinal
symptoms, and lethargy or malaise. Symptoms related to the
hypersensitivity reaction worsen with continued therapy and improve
within 72 hours of discontinuation of abacavir. Rechallenging with
abacavir after a hypersensitivity reaction typically results in
recurrence of symptoms within hours. Genetic predisposition for this
idiosyncratic hypersensitivity syndrome was suggested by its occurrence
in a small percentage of abacavir recipients during a short period of
drug exposure, and familial occurrence and decreased incidence in
individuals of African American origin (Symonds et al., 2002).
Consistent with these clinical observations, a strong predictive
association of HLA-B*5701 (142830.0003) was demonstrated, with further
evidence from recombinant haplotype mapping that the susceptibility
locus or loci reside specifically with the 57.1 ancestral haplotype,
identified by the haplospecific alleles HLA-B*5701 and C4A6 (see 120810)
and the HLA-DRB1*0701, HLA-DQ3 combination (Mallal et al., 2002). Martin
et al. (2004) reported that the combination of HLA-B*5701 and a
haplotypic M493T polymorphism of HSP70-HOM (140559) is highly predictive
of abacavir hypersensitivity.

- Association With Ankylosing Spondylitis

In a study of 15 multiplex families with ankylosing spondylitis
(106300), Rubin et al. (1992, 1994) found that 13 of 15 affected females
and 46 of 49 affected males were HLA-B27 (142830.0001) positive, as
compared with 22 of 43 unaffected females and 16 of 40 unaffected males.
The risk of ankylosing spondylitis for homozygotes was placed at 99.5%
and for heterozygotes at 43% with a sporadic risk of 0.1%. The B27
haplotype did not consistently segregate with disease in 2 families, but
both families still supported linkage to the major histocompatibility
complex. Identity-by-descent analyses showed a significant departure
from random segregation among affected avuncular (uncle/nephew-niece)
and cousin pairs. The presence of HLA-B40 in HLA-B27 positive
individuals increased the risk for disease more than 3-fold, confirming
previous reports. Disease susceptibility modeling suggested an autosomal
dominant pattern of inheritance with penetrance of approximately 20%. In
this study, which involved families from Toronto and Newfoundland, B27
alleles were detected by hybridization with sequence-specific
oligonucleotide probes after amplification of genomic DNA by PCR.

- Association With Age-Related Macular Degeneration

Goverdhan et al. (2005) investigated whether HLA genotypes were
associated with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD; see 603075).
They genotyped class I HLA-A, -B, and -Cw (see 142840) and class II DRB1
(142857) and DQB1 (604305) in 200 patients with ARMD, as well as in
controls. Allele Cw*0701 correlated positively with ARMD, whereas
alleles B*4001 and DRB1*1301 were negatively associated. These HLA
associations were independent of any linkage disequilibrium. Goverdhan
et al. (2005) concluded that HLA polymorphisms influenced the
development of ARMD and proposed modulation of choroidal immune function
as a possible mechanism for this effect.

- Association With Type I Diabetes

Nejentsev et al. (2007) used several large type I diabetes data sets to
analyze a combined total of 1,729 polymorphisms, and applied statistical
methods--recursive partitioning and regression--to pinpoint disease
susceptibility to the MHC class I genes HLA-B and HLA-A (142800) (risk
ratios greater than 1.5; P(combined) = 2.01 x 10(-19) and 2.35 x
10(-13), respectively) in addition to the established associations of
the MHC class II genes HLA-DQB1 (604305) and HLA-DRB1 (142857).
Nejentsev et al. (2007) suggested that other loci with smaller and/or
rarer effects might also be involved, but to find these future searches
must take into account both the HLA class II and class I genes and use
even larger samples. Taken together with previous studies, Nejentsev et
al. (2007) concluded that MHC class I-mediated events, principally
involving HLA-B*39, contribute to the etiology of type I diabetes.

- Association With Chronic Synovitis

Chronic synovitis occurs in about 10% of Indian patients with severe
hemophilia (HEMA, 306700; HEMB, 306900). Ghosh et al. (2003) reported an
association between the development of chronic synovitis in patients
with hemophilia and the HLA-B27 allele (142830.0001). Twenty-one (64%)
of 33 patients with both disorders had HLA-B27, compared to 23 (5%) of
440 with severe hemophilia without synovitis (odds ratio of 31.6). There
were 3 sib pairs with hemophilia in whom only 1 sib had synovitis; all
the affected sibs had the HLA-B27 allele, whereas the unaffected sibs
did not. Chronic synovitis presented as swelling of the joint with heat
and redness and absence of response to treatment with factor
concentrate. Ghosh et al. (2003) suggested that patients with HLA-B27
may ot be able to easily downregulate inflammatory mediators after
bleeding in the joints, leading to chronic synovitis.

- Association With Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction

Chung et al. (2004) studied 44 patients with carbamazepine-induced
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (608579), including 5 with overlapping toxic
epidermal necrolysis, in whom the clinical morphology fulfilled
Roujeau's diagnostic criteria (Roujeau, 1994). Controls included 101
patients who had been treated with carbamazepine for at least 3 months
without adverse reaction and 93 normal individuals. All participants
were Han Chinese residing in Taiwan. One hundred percent of the patients
who developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome carried the HLA-B*1502 allele
(142830.0002), while only 3% of the carbamazepine-tolerant individuals
and 8.6% of the normal controls carried this allele. When the
carbamazepine-tolerant group was used as the control, the presence of
HLA-B*1502 had a 93.6% positive predictive value for developing
carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome, whereas its absence had
a negative prediction value of 100%.

To identify genetic markers for allopurinol-induced severe cutaneous
adverse reaction (SCAR; 608579), Hung et al. (2005) genotyped 51
patients with allopurinol-SCAR and 228 controls (135
allopurinol-tolerant patients and 93 healthy individuals) for 823 SNPs
in genes related to drug metabolism and immune response. All
participants were unrelated Han Chinese residing in Taiwan. The
HLA-B*5801 allele (142830.0004) was present in all 51 of the patients
with allopurinol-SCAR, but in only 15% of allopurinol-tolerant controls
and 20% of healthy controls (p = 4.7 x 10(-24) and p = 8.1 x 10(-18),
respectively). Hung et al. (2005) concluded that the HLA-B*5801 allele
is an important genetic risk factor for severe cutaneous adverse
reactions to allopurinol in the Han Chinese population.

- Association With Drug-Induced Liver Injury Due To Flucloxacillin

In a genomewide association study of 51 patients with
flucloxacillin-induced liver injury and 282 controls, Daly et al. (2009)
found an association with dbSNP rs2395029 in the HCP5 gene (604676) in
the MHC region (p = 8.7 x 10(-33)). The SNP is in complete linkage
disequilibrium with HLA-B*5701 (142830.0003). Further MHC genotyping of
64 flucloxacillin-tolerant controls confirmed the association with
HLA-B*5701 (odds ratio of 80.6; p = 9.0 x 10(-19)). The association was
replicated in a second cohort of 23 patients. In HLA-B*5701 carriers,
dbSNP rs10937275 in the ST6GAL1 (109675) gene on chromosome 3q also
showed genomewide significance (odds ratio of 4.1; p = 1.4 x 10(-8)).

- Association With Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension
Without Deep Vein Thrombosis

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
HLA-B gene and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)
without deep vein thrombosis, see 612862.

- Reviews

Cooke and Hill (2001) reviewed the genetics of susceptibility to human
infectious disease. Association with class I HLA alleles and infectious
disease have been demonstrated mainly with HLA-B: B8 with susceptibility
to pulmonary tuberculosis, B35 with susceptibility to AIDS, B53 with
resistance to severe malaria, and B57 with resistance to AIDS (see Table
3 of Cooke and Hill, 2001).

EVOLUTION

All Amerindian groups show limited HLA polymorphism which probably
reflects the small founder populations that colonized America by
overland migration from Asia 11,000 to 40,000 years ago. Belich et al.
(1992) found that the nucleotide sequences of HLA-B alleles from 2
culturally and linguistically distinct tribes of Southern Brazil are
distinct from those in Caucasian, Oriental, and other populations. By
comparison, the HLA-A (142800) and HLA-C alleles are similar. These
results and those reported by Watkins et al. (1992) from studies of a
tribe in Ecuador showed that a marked evolution of HLA-B occurred after
humans first entered South America. New alleles were formed through
recombination between preexisting alleles, not by point mutation, giving
rise to distinctive diversification of HLA-B in different South American
Indian tribes. Segmental exchanges of this type, even if they occur at a
lower frequency than point mutations, could be useful in the development
of resistance to infectious disease, for example, inasmuch as the
probability of an adaptively useful variant is much higher when there is
segmental exchange of already structurally valid coding sequence rather
than random point mutation.

Although most of the human MHC loci are relatively stable, the HLA-B
locus appears to be capable of rapid changes, especially in isolated
populations. To investigate the mechanisms of HLA-B evolution, McAdam et
al. (1994) compared the sequences of 19 HLA-B homologs from chimpanzees
(Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) to 65 HLA-B sequences.
Despite obvious similarities between chimpanzee and human alleles in
exon 2, there was little conservation of exon 3 between human and the 2
chimpanzee species. This finding suggested to McAdam et al. (1994) that,
unlike all other HLA loci, recombination has characterized the HLA-B
locus and its homologs for over 5 million years.

By genotyping individuals from 30 distinct populations, Single et al.
(2007) detected strong negative correlations between the presence of
activating KIR genes and their corresponding HLA ligand groups across
populations, particularly for KIR3DS1 (604946) and its putative HLA-B
Bw4-80Ile ligands. Weak positive relationships, on the other hand, were
found between inhibitory KIR genes and their HLA ligands. A negative
correlation was observed between distance from East Africa and the
frequency of activating KIR genes and their corresponding ligands.
Single et al. (2007) concluded that activating, rather than inhibitory,
receptor-ligand pairs show the strongest signature of coevolution
between the complex KIR and HLA genetic systems.

In a study of 15 multiplex families with ankylosing spondylitis
(106300), Rubin et al. (1992, 1994) found that 13 of 15 affected females
and 46 of 49 affected males were HLA-B27 positive, as compared with 22

Chronic synovitis occurs in about 10% of Indian patients with severe
hemophilia (HEMA, 306700; HEMB, 306900). Ghosh et al. (2003) reported an
association between the development of chronic synovitis in patients
with hemophilia and the HLA-B27 allele. Twenty-one (64%) of 33 patients

hemophilia without synovitis (odds ratio of 31.6). There were 3 sib

sibs had the HLA-B27 allele, whereas the unaffected sibs did not.
Chronic synovitis presented as swelling of the joint with heat and

Ghosh et al. (2003) suggested that patients with HLA-B27 may ot be able
to easily downregulate inflammatory mediators after bleeding in the
joints, leading to chronic synovitis.

HLA-B, HLA-B*1502

Chung et al. (2004) studied 44 patients with carbamazepine-induced
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (608579), including 5 with overlapping toxic
epidermal necrolysis, in whom the clinical morphology fulfilled
Roujeau's diagnostic criteria (Roujeau, 1994). Controls included 101
patients who had been treated with carbamazepine for at least 3 months
without adverse reaction and 93 normal individuals. All participants
were Han Chinese residing in Taiwan. One hundred percent of the patients
who developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome carried the HLA-B*1502 allele,
while only 3% of the carbamazepine-tolerant individuals and 8.6% of the
normal controls carried this allele. When the carbamazepine-tolerant
group was used as the control, the presence of HLA-B*1502 had a 93.6%
positive predictive value for developing carbamazepine-induced
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, whereas its absence had a negative prediction
value of 100%.

In an expanded study of 60 Chinese patients with carbamazepine-induced
Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis, including the 44
patients reported by Chung et al. (2004), Hung et al. (2006) confirmed
the association between drug reaction and the HLA-B*1502 allele (p = 1.6
x 10(-41), odds ratio of 1,357). Fifty-nine of the 60 patients had the
susceptibility allele compared to 6 (4.2%) of 144 tolerant controls.
There was no association between HLA-B*1502 and 31 patients with
nonbullous adverse drug reactions, suggesting that HLA-B*1502 is
specific for bullous phenotypes.

Chen et al. (2011) recruited 4,877 candidate subjects from 23 hospitals
in Taiwan who had not taken carbamazepine. All were genotyped to
determine whether they carried the HLA-B*1502 allele. Those testing
positive (7.7% of the total) were advised not to take carbamazepine.
None of the 92.3% who were advised to take carbamazepine developed
Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. The estimated
historical incidence of carbamazepine-induced SJS-TEN (0.23%) would
translate into approximately 10 cases among study subjects (P less than
0.001).

ABACAVIR HYPERSENSITIVITY, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DRUG-INDUCED LIVER INJURY DUE TO FLUCLOXACILLIN, INCLUDED
HLA-B, HLA-B*5701

Abacavir is an HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor used in combination
with other antivirals in the treatment of HIV infection. Its efficacy is
equivalent to other HIV drugs, such as HIV protease inhibitors, and
different combinations of drugs are used in clinical practice depending
on patient response, side effects, and drug resistance profiles.
Hypersensitivity reactions occur in approximately 5% of abacavir
patients and are characterized by symptoms such as fever, rash, and
acute respiratory symptoms, and can lead to potentially life-threatening
hypotension if drug therapy is not discontinued (Clay, 2002). Veenstra
(2004) noted that 2 studies had shown that patients with the HLA-B*5701
genotype are at greater risk of a hypersensitivity reaction, with an
odds ratio of 117 (95% CI = 29-481) in 1 study (Mallal et al., 2002) and
23.6 (95% CI = 8-70) in another (Hetherington et al., 2002). Hughes et
al. (2004) presented a cost-effectiveness analysis of HLA-B*5701
genotyping in preventing abacavir hypersensitivity.

Martin et al. (2004) reported that the combination of HLA-B*5701 and a
haplotypic M493T polymorphism of HSP70-HOM (140559) is highly predictive
of abacavir hypersensitivity.

Mallal et al. (2008) found that HLA-B*5701 screening reduced the risk of
hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir used in the treatment of HIV
infection.

In a genomewide association study of 51 patients with
flucloxacillin-induced liver injury and 282 controls, Daly et al. (2009)
found an association with dbSNP rs2395029 in the MHC region (p = 8.7 x
10(-33)). The SNP is in complete linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B*5701.
Further MHC genotyping of 64 flucloxacillin-tolerant controls confirmed
the association with HLA-B*5701 (odds ratio of 80.6; p = 9.0 x 10(-19)).
The association was replicated in a second cohort of 23 patients. In
HLA-B*5701 carriers, dbSNP rs10937275 in the ST6GAL1 (109675) gene on
chromosome 3q also showed genomewide significance (odds ratio of 4.1; p
= 1.4 x 10(-8)).

HLA-B, HLA-B*5801

To identify genetic markers for allopurinol-induced severe cutaneous
adverse reaction (SCAR; 608579), Hung et al. (2005) genotyped 51
patients with allopurinol-SCAR and 228 controls (135
allopurinol-tolerant patients and 93 healthy individuals) for 823 SNPs
in genes related to drug metabolism and immune response. All
participants were unrelated Han Chinese residing in Taiwan. The
HLA-B*5801 allele was present in all 51 of the patients with
allopurinol-SCAR, but in only 15% of allopurinol-tolerant controls and
20% of healthy controls (p = 4.7 x 10(-24) and p = 8.1 x 10(-18),
respectively). Hung et al. (2005) concluded that the HLA-B*5801 allele
is an important genetic risk factor for severe cutaneous adverse
reactions to allopurinol in the Han Chinese population.

300061	TITLE *300061 ZINC FINGER, MYM-TYPE 3; ZMYM3
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 261; ZNF261;;
DXS6673E
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Van der Maarel et al. (1996) reported the cloning and characterization
of the ZNF261 gene, which the called DXS6673E. ZNF261 maps to the X
chromosome, is subject to X inactivation, and was disrupted in the
5-prime untranslated region by a balanced X;13 translocation in a
mentally retarded female. They identified a YAC clone that spanned the
breakpoint and used this YAC to isolate a cDNA from a fetal brain
library. The cDNA contains a 4,074-bp ORF encoding a predicted
1,358-amino acid polypeptide. By Northern analysis, van der Maarel et
al. (1996) showed that the DXS6673E gene is highly conserved among
vertebrates and that its expression is most abundant in brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Hakimi et al. (2003) identified a family of multiprotein corepressor
complexes that function through modifying chromatin structure to keep
genes silent. The polypeptide composition of these complexes includes a
common core of 2 subunits, HDAC1 (601241)/HDAC2 (605164) and the
FAD-binding protein BHC110 (AOF2; 609132). Other subunits of these
complexes include ZNF261, GTF2I (601679), and polypeptides associated
with cancer-causing chromosomal translocations.

GENE STRUCTURE

Van der Maarel et al. (1996) reported that the ZNF261 gene contains 25
exons, including 2 putative alternatively spliced noncoding exons (1A
and 1B).

MAPPING

Van der Maarel et al. (1996) mapped the ZNF261 gene to chromosome
Xq13.1.

CYTOGENETICS

Van der Maarel et al. (1996) reported a mentally retarded female whose
ZNF261 gene was disrupted in the 5-prime UTR by a balanced X;13
translocation. They noted that apart from mental retardation, the only
conspicuous clinical features in this patient were scoliosis and spotty
abdominal hypopigmentation.

603483	TITLE *603483 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 4E-BINDING PROTEIN 3; EIF4EBP3
;;4EBP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (EIF4F), which recognizes the cap
structure mediating translation initiation, consists of 3 polypeptides,
including EIF4E (133440), the cap-binding protein subunit. EIF4E
activity is regulated in part by 2 translational repressors, EIF4EBP1
(602223) and EIF4EBP2 (602224), which bind to it and prevent its
assembly into EIF4F. Poulin et al. (1998) isolated a prostate carcinoma
cell line cDNA encoding EIF4EBP3, which they designated 4EBP3, a new
member of the EIF4EBP family. The deduced 100-amino acid protein shares
57% and 59% identity with EIF4EBP1 and EIF4EBP2, respectively. Northern
blot analysis detected a major 800-bp transcript in almost every tissue
examined, although at varying levels. The authors demonstrated that the
14.6-kD EIF4EBP3 phosphoprotein is heat stable and binds to EIF4E in
vitro as well as in vivo. EIF4EBP3 overexpression specifically reduced
EIF4E-dependent translation.

By real-time quantitative RT-PCR of several mouse tissues, Poulin et al.
(2003) found 4Ebp3 highly expressed in liver, at a level 10-fold higher
than that in kidney. Other tissues expressed variable and significantly
lower levels of 4Ebp3 mRNA.

- MASK-BP3 Intergenic Splice Variant

Poulin et al. (2003) identified an mRNA of about 8.5 kb that hybridized
with a 4EBP3 probe in Northern blots and included exons 1 through 33 of
the MASK gene (ANKHD1; 610500) spliced to an intermediate exon 0,
followed by 4EBP3 exons B and C. The transcript lacked MASK exon 34 and
4EBP3 exon A.

GENE FUNCTION

By Western blot analysis, Kleijn et al. (2002) found 4EBP3 in the
cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of normal human primary T cells and of
HEK293 and HeLa cells. 4EBP3 was associated with EIF4E in both cell
compartments. The association of cytoplasmic 4EBP3 and EIF4E in HEK293
and HeLa cells was reduced by serum or interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680)
starvation. In primary T cells, the interaction was reduced by cell
activation.

Dowling et al. (2010) inhibited the mTORC1 (601231) pathway in cells
lacking EIF4EBP1, EIF4EBP2, and EIF4EBP3 and analyzed the effects on
cell size, cell proliferation, and cell cycle progression. Although the
EIF4EBPs had no effect on cell size, they inhibited cell proliferation
by selectively inhibiting the translation of mRNAs that encode
proliferation-promoting proteins and proteins involved in cell cycle
progression. Thus, Dowling et al. (2010) concluded that control of cell
size and cell cycle progression appear to be independent in mammalian
cells, whereas in lower eukaryotes, EIF4E binding proteins influence
both cell growth and proliferation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Poulin et al. (2003) determined that the EIF4EBP3 gene contains 3 exons
and spans 1.9 kb. The last exon is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Poulin et al. (2003) mapped the EIF4EBP3
gene to chromosome 5q31.3, where it lies downstream of the ANKHD1 gene.
Southern blot analysis demonstrated that EIF4EBP3 is present in single
copy. Poulin et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Eif4ebp3 gene to a region of
chromosome 18 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
5q31.

611425	TITLE *611425 CENTROSOMAL BRCA2-INTERACTING PROTEIN; CNTROB
;;CENTROBIN;;
LYST-INTERACTING PROTEIN LIP8; LIP8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CNTROB is a centrosomal protein that interacts with BRCA2 (600185) and
is required for centriole duplication and cytokinesis (Zou et al.,
2005).

CLONING

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis with the C-terminal 1,026 residues of
BRCA2 as bait followed by 5-prime RACE of human mammary gland cDNA, Zou
et al. (2005) cloned CNTROB, which they called centrobin. The authors
identified transcripts encoding a deduced 903-amino acid predominant
isoform called centrobin-alpha and a deduced 925-amino acid minor
isoform, centrobin-beta. CNTROB contains a predicted central coiled-coil
region with N- and C-terminal noncoiled regions, a structure common to
centrosomal proteins pericentrin (PCNT1; 170285) and ninein (NIN;
608684). Northern blot analysis detected a 3.8-kb transcript in most
human tissues with highest expression in testis, and in all cell lines
tested. Immunofluorescence studies using the normal mammary epithelial
cell line 76N and several cancer cell lines localized CNTROB to 1 or 2
perinuclear dots in interphase cells and to a single focus at the end of
each mitotic spindle in mitotic cells, in a pattern colocalizing with
that of centrosomal protein gamma-tubulin (TUBG1; 191135). Using
biochemical purification of centrosomes by sucrose-gradient
centrifugation and immunoblot analysis, Zou et al. (2005) localized
CNTROB to the centrosome fraction. Mitotic shake-off to synchronize 76N
TERT cells (a TERT (187270) immortalized 76N line) followed by
immunofluorescence and immunogold microscopy showed that CNTROB
localized to newly assembled daughter centrioles during centriole
assembly at late G1 or early S phase, and remained in the daughter
centrioles throughout the next cell cycle.

GENE FUNCTION

Following small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted knockdown of CNTROB in
HeLa cells, Zou et al. (2005) observed a reduction in the proportion of
interphase and mitotic cells containing 4 centrioles. The effect was
most pronounced in mitotic cells; while nearly all control cells
contained 4 centrioles, 51% of CNTROB-depleted cells contained 4
centrioles, 45% contained 2 centrioles, and 4% contained 1 centriole.
Further experiments with synchronized cells and anti-centrin 2 (CETN2;
300006) and anti-alpha tubulin (TUBA1; 191110) staining confirmed that
CNTROB depletion inhibited centriole duplication. Using time-lapse
photography of CNTROB-depleted cells, Zou et al. (2005) showed that
siRNA knockdown of CNTROB significantly reduced the number of cells
completing cytokinesis. Zou et al. (2005) concluded that depletion of
CNTROB impairs centriole duplication and cytokinesis.

609516	TITLE *609516 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 382; ZNF382
;;KRAB/ZINC FINGER SUPPRESSOR PROTEIN 1, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; KS1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor family, such as
ZNF382, play key roles in the regulation of cell proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis in response to a variety of stimuli
(Gebelein et al., 1998).

CLONING

Gebelein et al. (1998) cloned rat Znf382, which they called Ks1.
Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of Ks1, with
highest levels in lung, kidney, and testis. Immunofluorescence
localization detected epitope-tagged Ks1 in the nucleus following
transfection of a human pancreatic cell line.

By screening a fetal heart cDNA library using PCR primers designed to
amplify KRAB domain-encoding sequences, followed by EST database
analysis and RACE of fetal heart RNA, Luo et al. (2002) cloned ZNF382.
The deduced 548-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
about 64 kD. ZNF382 contains N-terminal KRAB A and KRAB B domains,
followed by a vestigial zinc finger, a nuclear localization signal, and
9 tandemly repeated Kruppel-type C2H2-zinc finger domains at its C
terminus. ZNF382 shares 91% and 83% amino acid identity with rat Ks1 in
the KRAB and zinc finger domains, respectively. Northern blot analysis
detected a 2.9-kb transcript abundantly expressed in heart. Weaker
expression was detected in skeletal muscle, but no expression was
detected in 6 other tissues examined. Expression of ZNF382 was more
widespread in human fetal tissues. Whole 34- and 40-day embryos showed
high ZNF382 expression. At later developmental stages, ZNF382 was
detected predominantly in cerebellum, kidney, and cerebrum, and to a
lesser extent in lung, heart, skeletal muscle, tongue, and adrenal
gland.

GENE FUNCTION

By biochemical analysis, Gebelein et al. (1998) determined that rat Ks1
contains 2 transcriptional repressor domains, R1 and R2. R1 corresponds
to the KRAB A motif, and R2 is located immediately after the KRAB B
motif. Expression of rat Ks1 in a mouse fibroblast line suppressed
neoplastic transformation mediated by Hras (190020) and other potent
oncogenes. Deletion analysis indicated that R2 was required to suppress
transformation.

Using a random oligonucleotide-binding assay, Gebelein and Urrutia
(2001) identified a 27-bp rat Ks1-binding element (KBE). Deletion and
site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the 9 C-terminal zinc fingers
and the KRAB domain of Ks1 were required for transcriptional repression
through the KBE site. The KRAB domain of Ks1 interacted with the KAP1
(TRIM28; 601742) corepressor, and mutations that abolished this
interaction alleviated Ks1-mediated transcriptional repression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Luo et al. (2002) determined that the ZNF382 gene contains 5 exons and
spans about 23 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Luo et al. (2002) mapped the ZNF382 gene
to chromosome 19q13.13.

;;NF-KAPPA-B-INDUCING KINASE; NIK;;
SERINE/THREONINE PROTEIN KINASE NIK;;
HSNIK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Several members of the tumor necrosis factor/nerve growth factor
receptor family (e.g., TNFR1; 191190) activate the transcription factor
NF-kappa-B (see NFKB1; 164011) through a common adaptor protein, TRAF2
(601895), whereas the type I interleukin-1 receptor (IL1R1; 147810)
activates NF-kappa-B independently of TRAF2. Using TRAF2 as bait in a
yeast 2-hybrid screening of a B-cell cDNA library and PCR, Malinin et
al. (1997) cloned a cDNA encoding MAP3K14, which they called NIK. The
deduced 947-amino acid NIK protein has a serine/threonine protein kinase
motif that resembles those of several MAP3Ks (see 600982). Northern blot
analysis detected a NIK transcript of 5 kb that was expressed at low
levels in testis, small intestine, spleen, thymus, peripheral blood
leukocytes, prostate, ovary, and colon.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Malinin et al. (1997) showed that TRAF2
interacted with NIK. Binding of full-length NIK to TRAF2 involved both
the N- and C-terminal regions of TRAF2. Overexpression of NIK in
293-EBNA cells induced NF-kappa-B, caused degradation of IKB-alpha
(164008), and did not directly affect REL (164910), a subunit of the
NK-kappa-B complex. Induction of NF-kappa-B by NIK required the NIK
kinase domain. TNFA (TNF; 191160), IL1 (see IL1A; 147760), and CD95
(134637) required intact NIK to activate NFKB, indicating that NIK
participates in a cascade common to the receptors of all 3 of these
activators.

By functional analysis of NIK and a kinase-deficient NIK expressed in
primary human cells and in inflamed rheumatoid arthritis tissue, Smith
et al. (2001) showed that NIK has a selective role in signaling by the
lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LTBR; 600979). They determined that NIK is
not required for signaling in response to lipopolysaccharide, IL1, and
TNFA and is not a generic IKK kinase.

Rosebeck et al. (2011) demonstrated that the API2 (BIRC2; 601712)/MALT1
(604860) fusion oncoprotein created by the recurrent t(11;18)(q21;q21)
in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma induced proteolytic
cleavage of NIK at arg325. NIK cleavage required the concerted actions
of both fusion partners and generated a C-terminal NIK fragment that
retained kinase activity and was resistant to proteasomal degradation.
The resulting deregulated NIK activity was associated with constitutive
noncanonical NF-kappa-B signaling, enhanced B-cell adhesion, and
apoptosis resistance. Rosebeck et al. (2011) concluded that their study
revealed the gain-of-function proteolytic activity of a fusion
oncoprotein and highlighted the importance of the noncanonical
NF-kappa-B pathway in B-lymphoproliferative disease.

GENE STRUCTURE

By PCR analysis of a cosmid containing NIK, Aronsson et al. (1998)
determined that NIK contains 15 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH and radiation hybrid analysis, Aronsson et al. (1998) mapped the
gene for NIK to chromosome 17q21. Shinkura et al. (1999) mapped the
mouse gene to chromosome 11 by linkage analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using exon-intron maps and mutation screening, Aronsson et al. (1998)
found no disease-specific alterations in the NIK gene in a pedigree with
frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17
(600274).

Thair et al. (2011) found that the CC genotype of the SNP dbSNP
rs7222094 within the NIK gene was associated with increased 28-day
mortality compared with the CT or TT genotypes in 2 cohorts of Caucasian
septic shock patients. In addition, patients with the CC genotype
experienced greater renal dysfunction. In lymphoblastoid cell lines, the
dbSNP rs7222094 genotype was most strongly associated with mRNA
expression of CXCL10 (147310). Accordingly , the CC genotype of dbSNP
rs7222094 was associated with significantly lower CXCL10 protein levels
compared with the TT genotype in both lymphoblastoid cell lines and
septic shock patients. Thair et al. (2011) proposed that the CC genotype
of dbSNP rs7222094 is associated with increased mortality and organ
dysfunction in septic shock patients, perhaps due to altered regulation
of NFKB pathway genes, including CXCL10.

ANIMAL MODEL

The alymphoplasia (aly) mutation of mouse is autosomal recessive and
characterized by the systemic absence of lymph nodes and Peyer patches
and disorganized splenic and thymic structures with immunodeficiency.
Shinkura et al. (1999) cloned the mouse Nik gene and determined that a
G-to-A transition leads to a gly855-to-arg substitution in the C
terminus of the protein, causing alymphoplasia in aly/aly mice.

Using gene targeting, Yin et al. (2001) generated Nik-deficient mice.
Nik -/- mice were grossly normal but lacked all lymph nodes, similar to
mice lacking LTBR. In addition, they had abnormal spleen and thymus
architecture and formed poor antibody responses upon immunization.
Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) showed that NFKB binding
of DNA by Nik -/- mouse fibroblasts and other cell types in response to
IL1, TNF, or LTB (600978) was normal compared with wildtype. However,
induction of the IKBA and MCP1 (158105) genes was defective in Nik -/-
cells after stimulation of LTBR but not after stimulation with TNF,
indicating a selective inability to transactivate at least some
NFKB-regulated genes. Yin et al. (2001) concluded that NIK is not the
common upstream regulatory kinase activating IKKs in the NFKB signaling
pathway. Instead, NIK acts in a receptor-selective manner. They also
proposed that different receptors that signal through NFKB may use
distinct serine kinases to regulate the transcriptional activity of the
NFKB complex.

Matsushima et al. (2001) found that both Nik -/- and Ikka -/- mice had
impaired NFKB activation in response to lymphotoxin B receptor
stimulation but not TNF receptor-1 stimulation. These mice also had
defective development of Peyer patches.

Claudio et al. (2002) showed that bone marrow (BM) cells from
Nfkb2-deficient mice, but not Nfkb1-deficient mice, failed to increase
relative and total IgD-positive transitional-1 (T1) stage B cells in
response to Baff (603969). In vivo, however, Nfkb2-deficient mice did
generate mature B cells, but at reduced numbers. Mice of the aly/aly
strain, which are naturally deficient in Nik, and mice of the A/WySNJ
strain, which have a mutation in Baffr (606269), also failed to produce
T1 B cells in response to Baff. Baff stimulation enhanced expression of
Bcl2 (151430) in T1 B cells, thereby promoting B-cell survival, and
caused the processing of the p100 form of Nfkb2 to p52, which again
required Baffr and Nik, but not Nemo (IKKG; 300248). Immunoblot analysis
showed that BM cells contained primarily p100. In contrast, T1 splenic
cells had higher levels of p52, and even higher amounts of p52 were
found in T2/mature B-cell subsets. Claudio et al. (2002) concluded that
through sustained exposure, BAFF activates NFKB in B cells primarily via
processing of p100 and contributes to B-cell survival in vivo probably
from the T1 stage onwards.

Using Nik -/- mice in a mouse model of inflammatory arthritis, Aya et
al. (2005) observed inflammation comparable to that seen in wildtype
controls but significantly less periarticular osteoclastogenesis and
bone erosion. The mutant mice were also completely resistant to
antigen-induced arthritis. Aya et al. (2005) suggested that NIK is a
possible therapeutic target in the immune and bone-destructive
components of inflammatory arthritis.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis to identify syntaxin-1 (see
186590)-interacting proteins, Chin et al. (2002) identified rat Rnf40,
which they called Staring. By searching EST databases, they identified
human RNF40. The human RNF40 protein contains 1,001 amino acids and
shares about 93% amino acid identity with the rat protein. Both proteins
have 6 coiled-coil domains and a C-terminal RING finger motif. Northern
blot analysis of human and rat tissue panels showed that RNF40 is
expressed ubiquitously. Western blot analysis showed expression of Rnf40
throughout rat brain, where it exists in both cytosolic and
membrane-associated pools.

Hwang et al. (2003) identified an S. cerevisiae protein, Bre1, as an
evolutionarily conserved RING finger protein that is required in vivo
for both ubiquitination of histone H2B and methylation of histone H3 on
lys4 (see 142711 for information on histones). They identified 2 human
homologs of Bre1, RNF20 (607699) and RNF40, which they termed BRE1A and
BRE1B, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Chin et al. (2002) showed that the rat Rpf40 protein binds and recruits
the brain-enriched E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubch8 (603890) to
syntaxin-1 and facilitates the ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent
degradation of syntaxin-1. These findings suggested that RPF40 is a
novel E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that targets syntaxin-1 for
degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

Hwang et al. (2003) showed that the S. cerevisiae Bre1 protein is
required in vivo for both H2B ubiquitination and H3 lys4 methylation.
They determined that the RING domain of Bre1 is essential for both of
these modifications, as is large-1 (Lge1), a protein required for cell
size control that copurifies with Bre1. In cells lacking the
euchromatin-associated histone variant H2A.Z, Bre1, Rad6 (see 312180),
and Lge1 were each essential for cell viability, supporting redundant
functions for H2B ubiquitination and H2A substitution in the formation
of active chromatin. Analysis of mutants demonstrated a function for
Bre1/Lge1-dependent H2B monoubiquitination in the control of cell size.

Wood et al. (2003) showed that the RING finger of S. cerevisiae Bre1 is
required for ubiquitination of H2B, methylation of lys4 and lys79 of H3,
and for telomeric silencing. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments
indicated that both Rad6 and Bre1 are recruited to a promoter. The
authors determined that Bre1 is essential for this recruitment of Rad6
and is dedicated to the transcriptional pathway of Rad6. The results
suggested that Bre1 is the likely E3 enzyme that directs Rad6 to modify
chromatin and ultimately to affect gene expression.

613586	TITLE *613586 NIN1/RPN12-BINDING PROTEIN 1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; NOB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In yeast, over 200 protein and RNA cofactors are required for ribosome
assembly, and these are generally conserved in eukaryotes. These factors
orchestrate modification and cleavage of the initial 35S precursor rRNA
transcript into the mature 18S, 5.8S, and 25S rRNAs, folding of the
rRNA, and binding of ribosomal proteins and 5S RNA. Nob1 is involved in
pre-rRNA processing. In a late cytoplasmic processing step, Nob1 cleaves
a 20S rRNA intermediate at cleavage site D to produce the mature 18S
rRNA (Lamanna and Karbstein, 2009).

CLONING

Fatica et al. (2003) cloned yeast Nob1 and, by database analysis, they
identified human NOB1. The deduced 412-amino acid human protein shares
significant homology with yeast Nob1 and its eukaryotic orthologs,
including a highly conserved PIN domain, which is predicted to be
involved in RNA degradation, and complete conservation of 4 cysteines in
the metal-binding zinc ribbon domain. Immunofluorescence microscopy of
yeast detected Nob1 in both the nucleus and cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Fatica et al. (2003) found that yeast Nob1 associated with pre-40S
ribosomal particles. Conditional Nob1 knockout in yeast led to
accumulation of the 20S rRNA intermediate and a block in processing of
the 20S pre-rRNA to the mature 18S rRNA. Fatica et al. (2003) concluded
that Nob1 is required for cytoplasmic conversion of the 20S pre-rRNA to
the mature 18S rRNA.

Lamanna and Karbstein (2009) showed that yeast Nob1 bound as a tetramer
to pre-18S rRNA fragments containing cleavage site D. RNA binding and
methylation protection experiments showed that Nob1 interacted with
helix 44 of 18S rRNA, around cleavage site D, as well as with part of
internal transcribed spacer-1, around cleavage site A2. Contacts at
cleavage site D were made by the PIN nuclease domain.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the NOB1 gene to chromosome 16q22.1 based on an
alignment of the NOB1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB026125) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PSME3 belongs to the proteasome activator subunit (PSME) gene family.
For background information on the PSME gene family, see PSME1 (600654).

CLONING

Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700) produce
autoantibodies against a number of nuclear antigens, including SNRP70
(180740), PCNA (176740), CDR1 (302650), and Ki. By screening a human
placenta cDNA library with a probe obtained by screening a bovine retina
cDNA library with anti-Ki sera from an SLE patient, Nikaido et al.
(1990) isolated a cDNA encoding PSME3, which they called Ki. Sequence
analysis predicted that the 254-amino acid, hydrophilic PSME3 protein
contains a nuclear localization signal and has a molecular mass of
approximately 30 kD, close to the 32 kD observed by Western blot
analysis. PSME3 shares over 99% amino acid identity with the bovine
sequence. RNA blot analysis of human placenta, bovine brain, and mouse
embryos detected 3.0- and 1.5-kb PSME3 transcripts.

GENE FUNCTION

Steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC3, or NCOA3; 601937) is an oncogene
frequently amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer. Using
immunoprecipitation analysis, Li et al. (2006) found that endogenous
SRC3 and REG-gamma interacted in HeLa cell nuclear extracts and MCF-7
breast cancer cells. Protein pull-down assays showed the REG-gamma
interacted specifically with the HAT domain of SRC3. Knockdown of
REG-gamma via RNA interference (RNAi) in breast cancer and human
embryonic kidney cell lines resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in SRC3
protein levels. Conversely, REG-gamma overexpression in HeLa cells
reduced SRC3 protein levels. In vitro proteasome assays using purified
proteins showed that REG-gamma promoted degradation of SRC3 by the 20S
proteasome in a ubiquitin- and ATP-independent manner. Knockdown of
REG-gamma via RNAi increased estrogen receptor (ER; see 133430) target
gene expression and enhanced estradiol-mediated cell growth in MCF-7
cells, and these effects were secondary to the effect of REG-gamma on
SRC3.

MAPPING

By analysis of overlapping YAC contigs and by FISH, Albertsen et al.
(1994) mapped the PSME3 gene to 17q12-q21. Kandil et al. (1997) mapped
the mouse Psme3 gene to chromosome 14 using interspecific backcross
analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Barton et al. (2004) found that mice lacking Psme3 had normal levels of
surface class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules,
slightly reduced Cd8 (see 186910)-positive T cells, and normal responses
to infection with influenza or SV40 virus. However, the ability of Psme3
-/- mice to clear the pulmonary fungal pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum
was slower than wildtype mice. Barton et al. (2004) proposed that PSME3
functions in the MHC class I antigen-processing pathway and that it
exerts an influence on proteasome cleavage specificity.

611411	TITLE *611411 CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE KINASE 1, ALPHA; CAMKK1
;;CAMKK-ALPHA; CAMKKA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CAMKK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation and activation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin
kinase (CaMK) as an upstream component of the CaMK cascade that has been
implicated in neuronal gene transcription, synaptic plasticity, and
long-term memory consolidation (Blaeser et al., 2006).

CLONING

By screening a rat brain cDNA library using partial amino acid sequence
of a 68-kD purified rat brain CaMK kinase, followed by 5-prime RACE,
Tokumitsu et al. (1995) cloned rat Camkk1. The deduced 505-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 56 kD. Camkk1 shares 30 to
40% amino acid identity over the catalytic domains of serine/threonine
kinases such as the CaM-kinase family (see CAMK2A; 114078). Camkk1
contains a 22-amino acid proline-, arginine-, and glycine-rich insert
between the ATP-binding motif and DGF kinase motif that is similar to
the insert in yeast Ste11. Northern blot analysis of rat tissues
detected high expression in forebrain, lower expression in cerebellum,
and detectable signal in thymus and spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Western blot analysis or gel overlay, Tokumitsu et al. (1995)
showed that Camkk1 binds calmodulin (CALM1; 114180) and activated Camk4
(114080) with a 6-fold increase in total activity and a 100-fold
increase in Camk4 Ca(2+)-independent activity. Camkk1 catalyzed a
10-fold increase in the total activity of Camk1 (604998) and had no
effect on Camk2 (see CAMK2A; 114078). Cotransfection of COS-7 cells with
Camkk1 and Camk4 resulted in a 14-fold increase in CRE-binding protein
(CREB1; 123810)-dependent transcription compared with Camk4 alone,
suggesting that Camkk1 enhances Camk4-mediated transcriptional
regulation.

Using pharmacologic inhibitors to block potential pathways involved in
cytomegalovirus (CMV)-mediated activation of glycolysis, McArdle et al.
(2011) found that inhibition of CAMKK, but not CAMK2 or protein kinase A
(PKA; see 176911), blocked CMV-mediated glycolysis activation. CMV
infection also induced CAMKK1 mRNA and protein expression. Inhibition of
CAMKK had a negligible impact on CMV immediate-early protein
accumulation, but it severely attenuated production of CMV viral
progeny, reduced expression of 1 early CMV gene, and blocked viral DNA
replication. CAMKK inhibition had no impact on herpes simplex virus
(HSV)-1-induced glycolytic activation and a limited impact on HSV-1
replication. McArdle et al. (2011) concluded that CAMKK has a role that
is CMV specific and that it is an important factor in both CMV
replication and glycolytic activation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CAMKK1
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP SHGC-32989).

ANIMAL MODEL

Blaeser et al. (2006) generated mice with targeted disruption of Camkk1
and carried out a variety of behavioral and learning and memory tests.
Mutant mice exhibited normal long-term spatial memory, cued fear memory,
basal synaptic transmission, and long-term potentiation. However, mutant
mice displayed deficient long-term contextual fear memory, as measured
in the post-shock freezing response. Mutant mice displayed decreased
stress-induced anxiety-like behavior; however, other measures of anxiety
such as the elevated plus maze and open field tests showed no difference
from wildtype. Blaeser et al. (2006) concluded that Camkk1 plays a
selective role in contextual fear memory. They showed that mice lacking
Camkk1 displayed decreased phosphorylation and activation of Camk4 and
Creb in specific brain areas involved in contextual fear memory
formation.

610735	TITLE *610735 MYOZENIN 3; MYOZ3
;;CALSARCIN 3;;
FATZ-RELATED PROTEIN 3; FRP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, followed by PCR of a human skeletal muscle cDNA
library, Frey and Olson (2002) cloned MYOZ3, which they called
calsarcin-3. The predicted 251-amino acid protein exhibits highest
homology to MYOZ1 (605603) and MYOZ2 (605602) at its N and C termini and
shares 75% identity with mouse Myoz3. Northern blot analysis of adult
human tissues revealed expression of a major 3.4-kb transcript, as well
as 2 other transcripts, in skeletal muscle only,

GENE FUNCTION

Frey and Olson (2002) showed that calsarcin-3 coimmunoprecipitated with
calcineurin (see 114105) and the Z disc proteins telethonin (TCAP;
604488), alpha-actinin-2 (ACTN2; 102573), and gamma-filamin (FLNC;
102565). Analysis of deletion mutants revealed 2 independent domains
that are sufficient to bind ACTN2, an N-terminal and a C-terminal
domain, with the former domain also required for calcineurin and
telethonin binding. A second N-terminal domain mediated binding to
gamma-filamin. By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, they showed that ZASP (LDB3;
605906) interacted strongly with all 3 calsarcins. Immunolocalization
experiments revealed a strong Z disc staining pattern in cryosections of
mouse hindlimb skeletal muscle, as indicated by colocalization with
alpha-actinin. Preferential expression of calsarcin-3 in fast-twitch
myofibers was observed using immunofluorescence. Frey and Olson (2002)
proposed that calsarcins may serve to crosslink Z disc proteins,
contributing to the formation and maintenance of the Z disc.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Frey and Olson (2002) mapped the MYOZ3
gene to chromosome 5q31.

GENE STRUCTURE

Frey and Olson (2002) determined that the MYOZ3 gene contains 7 exons
and spans approximately 19 kb.

602912	TITLE *602912 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 6; EIF6
;;INTEGRIN, BETA-4, BINDING PROTEIN OF; ITGB4BP;;
p27, BETA-4 INTEGRIN-BINDING PROTEIN; p27BBP;;
EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 3A; EIF3A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The integrin beta-4 subunit (ITGB4; 147557) is highly enriched in
hemidesmosomes, specialized structures providing firm mechanical links
between basal lamina and the intermediate filament cytoskeleton. A
303-amino acid segment of the ITGB4 cytoplasmic domain that encompasses
the first 2 N-terminal fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains and their
interconnecting sequence is necessary for mediating ITGB4 signaling
events and incorporation into hemidesmosomes. Using a yeast 2-hybrid
system to identify polypeptides that interact with this functional
region of the ITGB4 cytodomain, Biffo et al. (1997) isolated human
epithelial cell cDNAs encoding ITGB4-binding protein (ITGB4BP), which
they called p27BBP. Southern blot analysis showed that the human genome
contains a single copy of the ITGB4BP gene. Northern blot analysis and
in situ hybridization detected Itgb4bp mRNA in all mouse tissues
examined, with the highest levels mainly in proliferating epithelia and
in epithelial tissues containing Itgb4. The predicted human ITGB4BP
protein has 245 amino acids and lacks a signal sequence. Western blot
analysis using antibodies against ITGB4BP detected a 27-kD protein in
epithelial cell lysates, which is in agreement with the calculated
molecular mass of ITGB4BP. Both in yeast and in vitro, ITGB4BP
specifically bound to the first 2 FNIII domains of ITGB4. ITGB4BP is an
insoluble protein that is present in the nucleus and cytoplasm. It is
associated with the intermediate filament pool and is localized at the
submembrane level in close apposition with ITGB4. The authors suggested
that ITGB4BP links ITGB4 to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton.

Eukaryotic translation initiation factor-6 (EIF6) binds to the 60S
ribosomal subunit and prevents its association with the 40S ribosomal
subunit. Using antibodies against purified rabbit EIF6 protein to
immunoscreen a HeLa cell cDNA expression library, Si et al. (1997)
isolated a cDNA encoding EIF6. Northern blot analysis detected an
approximately 1.1-kb transcript in all human tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Ceci et al. (2003) demonstrated that the ribosomal 60S subunit is
activated by release of EIF6. In the cytoplasm, EIF6 is bound to free
60S but not to 80S subunits. Furthermore, EIF6 interacts in the
cytoplasm with RACK1 (176981), a receptor for activated protein kinase C
(PKC; see 176960). RACK1 is a major component of translating ribosomes,
which harbor significant amounts of PKC. Loading 60S subunits with EIF6
caused a dose-dependent translational block and impairment of 80S
formation, which were reversed by expression of RACK1 and stimulation of
PKC in vivo and in vitro. PKC stimulation led to EIF6 phosphorylation,
and mutation of a serine residue in the carboxy terminus of EIF6
impaired RACK1/PKC-mediated translational rescue. Ceci et al. (2003)
proposed that EIF6 release regulates subunit joining, and that RACK1
provides a physical and functional link between PKC signaling and
ribosome activation.

To elucidate how microRNAs mediate their repressive effects, Chendrimada
et al. (2007) performed biochemical and functional assays to identify
new factors in the microRNA pathway. Chendrimada et al. (2007) showed
that human RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) associated with a
multiprotein complex containing MOV10 (610742), the homolog of
Drosophila translational repressor Armitage, and proteins of the 60S
ribosome subunit. Notably, this complex contains the antiassociation
factor EIF6, a ribosome inhibitory protein known to prevent productive
assembly of the 80S ribosome. Depletion of EIF6 in human cells
specifically abrogated miRNA-mediated regulation of target protein and
mRNA levels. Similarly, depletion of EIF6 in C. elegans diminished Lin4
microRNA-mediated repression of the endogenous Lin14 and Lin28 (611043)
target protein and mRNA levels. Chendrimada et al. (2007) concluded that
their results uncovered an evolutionarily conserved function of the
ribosome antiassociation factor EIF6 in microRNA-mediated
posttranscriptional silencing.

Gandin et al. (2008) demonstrated that mammalian eIF6 is required for
efficient initiation of translation in vivo. Eif6-null mouse embryos
were lethal at preimplantation. Heterozygous mice had 50% reduction of
eIF6 levels in all tissues, and showed reduced mass of hepatic and
adipose tissues due to a lower number of cells and to impaired G1/S cell
cycle progression. eIF6 heterozygous cells retained sufficient nucleolar
eIF6 and normal ribosome biogenesis. The liver of eIF6 heterozygous mice
displayed an increase of 80S in polysomal profiles, indicating a defect
in initiation of translation. Consistently, isolated hepatocytes had
impaired insulin-stimulated translation. Heterozygous mouse embryonic
fibroblasts recapitulated the organism phenotype and had normal ribosome
biogenesis, reduced insulin-stimulated translation, and delayed G1/S
phase progression. Furthermore, eIf6 heterozygous cells were resistant
to oncogene-induced transformation. Thus, Gandin et al. (2008) concluded
that eIF6 is the first eIF associated with the large 60S subunit that
regulates translation in response to extracellular signals.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Sanvito et al. (1998) mapped the
ITGB4BP gene to 20q11.2.

602871	TITLE *602871 PERIPLAKIN; PPL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The intermediate filament cytoskeleton of keratinocytes, composed of
keratins (see 139350) that are expressed in specific expression pairs
according to tissue and differentiation state, are interconnected
through transmembrane protein complexes called desmosomes and connect
with the basement membrane via hemidesmosomes. The proteins thought to
make contact with the intermediate filaments of keratinocytes belong to
a family of proteins known as plakins, of which desmoplakin (125647),
envoplakin (601590), and periplakin are members. These proteins have a
similar overall domain structure that includes an N-terminal globular
domain, a central coiled-coil rod domain, and a C-terminal tail with
characteristic repeat sequences.

CLONING

Ruhrberg et al. (1997) cloned PPL from a keratinocyte expression library
using antibody to PPL as the probe. The deduced 1,666-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of about 205 kD. PPL shares extensive
sequence homology with other proteins of the plakin family, with highest
identities found in the N- and C-terminal domains. Immunoblots of
keratinocyte extracts revealed a protein with an apparent molecular mass
of 195 kD. Immunogold electron microscopy revealed association of PPL
with the desmosomal plaque and with keratin filaments in the
differentiated layers of the epidermis.

Aho et al. (1998) isolated PPL in a yeast 2-hybrid system by its
interactions with type XVII collagen, a component of hemidesmosomes. The
PPL clones from human keratinocyte and placenta libraries span
approximately 6.2 kb. The predicted 1,756-amino acid periplakin
polypeptide has a computed molecular mass of approximately 204 kD. PPL
shares 50.3% amino acid sequence similarity with envoplakin. Northern
blot analysis revealed that a 6.5-kb PPL message is expressed
predominantly in keratinocytes compared to fibroblasts; dot blot
analysis detected expression in tissues containing epithelial cells,
with the highest expression in trachea, and in nonepithelial tissues,
most notably in many areas of the brain.

By RT-PCR, Kazerounian et al. (2002) detected significant expression of
PPL in brain, heart, liver, pancreas, placenta, skeletal muscle, colon,
and small intestine.

GENE FUNCTION

Ruhrberg et al. (1997) noted that the influx of Ca(2+) that occurs
following treatment of confluent keratinocyte cultures with a detergent
or with a calcium ionophore stimulates the cross-linking of cornified
envelope precursors by transglutaminases (190195). PPL became
cross-linked following exposure of keratinocytes to these agents, and a
transglutaminase inhibitor blocked PPL cross-linking.
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed interaction between PPL and
envoplakin. Analysis of putative ionic interactions between the rod
domains suggested that both PPL and envoplakin could form homodimers and
heterodimers. Confocal immunofluorescent microscopy of cultured
epidermal keratinocytes suggested that envoplakin and PPL form a network
radiating from desmosomes.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Kazerounian et al. (2002) found that a
linker region within the C-terminal globular domain of periplakin
interacts with keratin-8 (K8; 148060) and vimentin (193060). In an in
vitro pull-down assay, K18 (148070) also coprecipitated with K8 with the
periplakin C-terminal tail, suggesting that periplakin can interact with
K8 within the K8/K18 heterodimer.

GENE STRUCTURE

Aho et al. (1999) determined that the PPL gene contains 22 exons and
spans 60 kb. The 5-prime flanking sequence is GC rich (80%) and contains
multiple AP2 (107580) and SP1 (189906) sites, but no canonical TATA or
CCAAT boxes. The gene also has multiple Alu repeats and numerous MIR and
L1 elements.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Aho et al. (1998) assigned the PPL gene to
chromosome 16p13. By use of an interspecific backcross panel, they
mapped the mouse periplakin gene to the proximal part of mouse
chromosome 16, a region syntenic with human chromosome 16. By somatic
cell hybrid analysis and FISH, Ruhrberg et al. (1998) mapped the PPL
gene to chromosome 16p13.3. They mapped the mouse Ppl gene to chromosome
16A-B1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Aho et al. (2004) found that Ppl -/- mice were born in the expected
mendelian frequency, developed normally, possessed grossly normal
epidermis and hair, and were healthy and fertile. The epidermal barrier
developed normally during embryonic days 15.5 to 16.5, and the cornified
envelope and desmosomes in the newborn mice were ultrastructurally
normal. No compensatory increase in the expression of other epithelial
proteins was detected in neonatal mouse epidermis lacking periplakin.
Aho et al. (2004) concluded that the primary role of periplakin may not
relate to the physiology of the cornified cell envelope in epidermal
keratinocytes.

610514	TITLE *610514 PHD FINGER PROTEIN 17; PHF17
;;GENE FOR APOPTOSIS AND DIFFERENTIATION IN EPITHELIA; JADE1;;
KIAA1807
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned PHF17, which they designated
KIAA1807. The deduced 702-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with the human zinc finger protein BR140 (BRPF1; 602410).
RT-PCR ELISA detected very high expression in whole adult brain and
intermediate expression in all other tissues examined, including all
specific brain regions tested.

Using VHL (608537) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of an adult human
kidney cDNA library, Zhou et al. (2002) cloned PHF17, which they called
JADE1. The deduced 509-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 58.4 kD. It has a PEST domain near its N-terminal end, 2 central
plant homeodomains (PHDs), and candidate sites for N-glycosylation,
myristoylation, and serine or threonine phosphorylation. Northern blot
analysis detected transcripts of 6.0 and 3.6 kb with high expression in
kidney, followed by moderate expression in pancreas and skeletal muscle,
and low expression in all other examined tissues. Western blot analysis
detected human and mouse Jade1 at 64 and 61 kD, respectively, with high
expression in mouse and human kidney, moderate expression in human
pancreas, liver, and heart and in mouse liver, and no expression in
human brain. Western blot analysis of mouse kidney cortex and cultured
cells revealed prominent expression in proximal tubule cells. Endogenous
JADE1 localized to prominent nuclear speckles and diffuse cytoplasmic
speckles in human renal cancer cells.

By database and genomic sequence analyses, Tzouanacou et al. (2003)
identified several splice variants of mouse and human JADE1 that encode
at least 2 protein isoforms, JADE1L and JADE1S. JADE1L likely
corresponds to the 6.0-kb transcript reported by Zhou et al. (2002). The
deduced 842-amino acid JADE1L protein has an N-terminal PEST motif,
followed by 2 PHD zinc finger domains, a bipartite nuclear localization
signal, and a C-terminal PEST motif. JADE1S corresponds to the JADE1
transcript cloned by Zhou et al. (2002). The deduced 510-amino acid
JADE1S protein lacks the nuclear localization signal and C-terminal PEST
motif of JADE1L. Jade1 was expressed in mouse primitive streak and tail
bud and in other embryonic regions containing pluripotent or
tissue-specific progenitor cells including early gastrulation epiblast
and the ventricular zone of the cerebral cortex. Jade1 was also
expressed in developing musculature and extraembryonic tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid and immunoprecipitation analysis of endogenous and
cotransfected proteins, Zhou et al. (2002) showed that VHL bound avidly
and selectively to JADE1. Analysis of the binding between truncated
proteins showed that the N terminus and the inter-PHD region of JADE1
were important for interaction with VHL. VHL increased the abundance of
JADE1, primarily by prolonging JADE1 protein half-life.

Using reporter gene constructs, Panchenko et al. (2004) showed that
JADE1 could activate transcription and that deletion of the PHD zinc
fingers abolished transcriptional activity. JADE1 also promoted histone
H4 (see 602822), but not histone H3 (see 602810) acetylation in a
dose-dependent manner, and acetylation required the PHDs. A JADE1 mutant
lacking the second PHD behaved in a dominant-negative manner. TIP60
(HTATIP; 601409), a histone acetyltransferase with histone H4/H2A
specificity, physically associated with JADE1 and augmented JADE1
acetyltransferase function.

Zhou et al. (2005) found that expression of JADE1 was very low in all
human renal carcinoma cell lines tested and was independent of VHL
expression. Inhibition of proteasome activity increased JADE1 protein
expression. JADE1 inhibited renal cancer cell growth, colony formation,
and tumor formation in nude mice, and reduced the branching of renal
cell growth in 3-dimensional cultures. JADE1 increased apoptosis and
decreased levels of antiapoptotic BCL2 (151430), and antisense JADE1
increased cell growth rates. Zhou et al. (2005) concluded that JADE1 is
a proapoptotic barrier to proliferation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tzouanacou et al. (2003) determined that the mouse Phf17 gene contains
13 exons, including 3 alternative noncoding first exons. They stated
that the human PHF17 gene has a similar structure.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PHF17
gene to chromosome 4 (TMAP SHGC-67603).

ANIMAL MODEL

Tzouanacou et al. (2003) found that Jade1-null mouse embryos were viable
and fertile and showed no obvious abnormalities compared to their
wildtype or heterozygote littermates. However, Jade1-null animals were
obtained at less than the expected mendelian ratio at weaning age.

126391	TITLE *126391 LIGASE I, DNA, ATP-DEPENDENT; LIG1
;;DNA LIGASE I
DESCRIPTION The major DNA ligase activity in proliferating mammalian cells is due to
the high molecular weight enzyme designated DNA ligase I. Barnes et al.
(1990) cloned cDNA for human DNA ligase I, both by functional
complementation of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc9 mutation and by
hybridization with oligonucleotide probes corresponding to peptide
sequences of the purified bovine enzyme. Hybridization between the
cloned sequences and mRNA as well as genomic DNA indicated that the
human enzyme is transcribed from a single-copy gene. Barnes et al.
(1990) mapped the DNA ligase I gene to chromosome 19 by hybridization to
DNAs from well-characterized rodent-human somatic cell hybrids retaining
subsets of human chromosomes. By analysis of rodent-human somatic cell
hybrids and by 2-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Barnes
et al. (1992) assigned the LIG1 gene to 19q13.2-q13.3 and demonstrated
that it is distal to ERCC1 (126380). By FISH, Trask et al. (1993)
assigned the LIG1 gene to 19q13.2-q13.3.

Using a mapping panel from an interspecific cross, Gariboldi et al.
(1995) mapped the Lig1 gene to the centromeric part of mouse chromosome
7, a region homologous to human 19q.

Noguiez et al. (1992) demonstrated that the LIG1 gene has 28 exons
spanning 53 kb of genomic DNA. The first exon is untranslated and uses a
GC dinucleotide instead of the canonical GT splice donor. The 5-prime
flanking region lacks a TATA box and is highly GC-rich, as is
characteristic of 'housekeeping' genes. In common with the promoters of
genes encoding other DNA replication enzymes, such as DNA polymerase
alpha (312040), the 5-prime flanking region of the LIG1 gene contains
recognition elements for several transcription factors that may mediate
increased expression in quiescent cells in response to growth factors.

It has been suggested that a defect in the DNA ligase I gene accounts
for the primary metabolic defect in Bloom syndrome; see 210900. By
screening the coding sequence of the LIG1 gene in 4 cases of Bloom
syndrome, Barnes et al. (1992) found no mutation. However, in a cell
line referred to as 46BR, derived from a patient who displayed
immunodeficiency, stunted growth, and sun sensitivity, they detected 2
missense mutations occurring in different alleles of the LIG1 gene (see
126391.0001). The identification of a definitive and different molecular
defect in Bloom syndrome (210900.0001) excludes further the involvement
of LIG1 in that disorder.

Lindahl and Barnes (1992) gave an extensive review of the mammalian DNA
ligases.

Although it had been reported that DNA ligase I is essential for cell
viability, Bentley et al. (1996) showed that cells lacking DNA ligase I
are, in fact, viable. Using gene targeting in embryonic stem (ES) cells,
they produced DNA ligase I-deficient mice. Embryos developed normally to
midterm, when hematopoiesis usually switches to the fetal liver.
Thereupon, acute anemia developed, despite the presence of
erythroid-committed progenitor cells in the liver. Thus, Bentley et al.
(1996) concluded that DNA ligase I is required for normal development
but is not essential for replication. They proposed that a previously
unsuspected redundancy must exist between mammalian DNA ligases.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure {8:Pascal et al. (2004)} reported the
crystal structure of human DNA ligase I (residues 233-919) in complex
with a nicked, 5-prime adenylated DNA intermediate. The structure shows
that the enzyme redirects the path of the double helix to expose the
nick termini for the strand-joining reaction. It also reveals a unique
feature of mammalian ligases: a DNA-binding domain that allows ligase I
to encircle its DNA substrate, stabilizes the DNA in a distorted
structure, and positions the catalytic core on the nick. Pascal et al.
(2004) suggested that similarities in the toroidal shape and dimensions
of DNA ligase I and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen sliding clamp
are suggestive of an extensive protein-protein interface that may
coordinate the joining of Okazaki fragments.

Webster et al. (1982) described a syndrome of immunodeficiency and
increased cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. The patient had
sun sensitivity and stunted growth and died at the age of 19 years with
lymphoma (Webster et al., 1992). Developmental milestones had been
delayed; she was able to sit at 2 years and did not walk or have normal
sphincter control until 3 years. Recurrent middle ear and chest
infections led to poor hearing and bronchiectasis. Secondary sexual
characteristics did not develop during adolescence. At the age of 17,
patches of venous dilatation appeared on her skin, mainly on the limbs.
There was also some telangiectasia on the bulbar conjunctivae. The
photographs showed the proband to have been less than 130 cm tall at age
14 years (Webster et al., 1992). The cell line derived from the patient,
called 46BR, was shown by Barnes et al. (1992) to contain 2 missense
mutations in different alleles of the DNA ligase I gene, i.e., the
patient was a compound heterozygote. One allele showed a substitution of
lysine for glutamic acid-566 and was presumably derived from the
deceased father because the other allele carried an arg771-to-trp
mutation (126391.0002) which was present also in the mother of the
proband. The cultured fibroblasts exhibited retarded joining of Okazaki
fragments during DNA replication and hypersensitivity to a variety of
DNA-damaging agents.

142370	TITLE *142370 HEMOPOIETIC CELL KINASE; HCK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HCK is an SRC (190090) family tyrosine kinase that is expressed
predominantly in granulocytic and monocytic cells. It has proposed
functional roles in phagocytosis and receptor-mediated signaling
(summary by Scott et al., 2002).

CLONING

During a search for a cDNA clone representing human SRC (190090),
Quintrell et al. (1987) encountered a previously unrecognized gene that
appeared to encode a protein-tyrosine kinase similar to SRC. Ziegler et
al. (1987) found the same gene by a different route. Expression of this
gene may be limited to certain hemopoietic cells and is especially
prominent in cells of myeloid lineage, particularly mature granulocytes
and monocytes. Therefore, Quintrell et al. (1987) designated the gene
HCK (pronounced 'hick') for hemopoietic cell kinase. They described the
nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone representing most or all of the mRNA
for HCK, the deduced amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by HCK,
and the distribution of RNA transcribed from HCK among various
hemopoietic cells. The deduced HCK protein contains 505 amino acids and
has a calculated molecular mass of about 57 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mass spectrometric analysis, Scott et al. (2002) identified 25
potential binding partners in a human monocyte cell line for the SH3
domain of HCK. Analysis with purified proteins and in intact cells
confirmed the interactions with WIP (WIPF1; 602357), WASP (WAS; 300392),
and ELMO1 (606420). ELMO1 was heavily tyrosine phosphorylated in cells
coexpressing HCK and ELMO1, suggesting that ELMO1 is a HCK substrate.
Pull-down analysis showed that binding of ELMO1 to the HCK SH3 domain
could be inhibited by polyproline peptides, indicating that an ELMO1
polyproline motif interacts with HCK. Scott et al. (2002) concluded that
WIP, WASP, and ELMO1 may be activators or effectors of HCK.

MAPPING

By spot-blot analysis of sorted chromosomes and by in situ
hybridization, Quintrell et al. (1987) assigned the HCK gene to
chromosome 20q11-q12. Since this region is affected by interstitial
deletions in some acute myeloid leukemias and myeloproliferative
disorders, they suggested that damage to HCK may contribute to the
pathogenesis of these conditions.

604632	TITLE *604632 VAC14, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; VAC14
;;ASSOCIATED REGULATOR OF PIKFYVE; ARPIKFYVE;;
TAX1-BINDING PROTEIN 2; TAX1BP2;;
TAX-REACTIVE PROTEIN X; TRX
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The content of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) in
endosomal membranes changes dynamically with fission and fusion events
that generate or absorb intracellular transport vesicles. VAC14 is a
component of a trimolecular complex that tightly regulates the level of
PtdIns(3,5)P2. Other components of this complex are the
PtdIns(3,5)P2-synthesizing enzyme PIKFYVE (609414) and the PtdIns(3,5)P2
phosphatase FIG4 (609390). VAC14 functions as an activator of PIKFYVE
(Sbrissa et al., 2007).

CLONING

Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) encodes Tax1, a 40-kD
protein that plays a key role in viral replication, transformation, and
gene regulation. By screening a human Jurkat T-cell cDNA expression
library with biologically active Tax1 protein to identify Tax1-binding
proteins, Mireskandari et al. (1996) isolated a cDNA encoding VAC14,
which they called TRX. The deduced 221-amino acid TRX protein is
predominantly hydrophilic in its C-terminal region. Northern blot
analysis of human tissues detected a major 3.5-kb TRX transcript in all
tissues examined, namely brain, heart, lung, liver, pancreas, kidney,
skeletal muscle, and placenta. However, Western blot analysis detected
TRX expression only in lymphocytes and lymphocytic-derived cell lines.

Sbrissa et al. (2004) obtained a full-length cDNA clone of human VAC14.
The deduced protein contains 782 amino acids. Western blot analysis of
human and other mammalian cell lines and of mouse tissues detected VAC14
at an apparent molecular mass of 82 kD. Fractionation and Western blot
analysis of HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells revealed endogenous
VAC14 in both cytosolic and membrane compartments. Immunohistochemical
analysis of transfected COS cells showed that human VAC14 localized
predominantly to the perinuclear region and also in more dispersed
vesicles.

HEAT repeats contain 2 antiparallel helices connected by a short loop
and provide surfaces for protein-protein interactions. Jin et al. (2008)
identified 17 HEAT repeats in mouse and human VAC14.

GENE FUNCTION

Mireskandari et al. (1996) demonstrated a specific interaction between
Tax1 and TRX by coimmunoprecipitation and Far Western blot analyses.

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Sbrissa et al. (2004) showed that
human VAC14 colocalized with mouse Pikfyve in the perinuclear region
following cotransfection of COS cells. Knockdown of VAC14 expression in
HEK293 cells did not alter cell morphology, but it sensitized cells to
brief treatment with a weak base, which resulted in formation of
cytoplasmic vacuoles and decreased production of PtsIns(3,5)P and
PtdIns(5)P by PIKFYVE. Conversely, overexpression of VAC14 in HEK293
cells increased PIKFYVE protein levels and PIKFYVE activity. Reciprocal
coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that endogenous Pikfyve and Vac14
interacted directly in rat PC12 cells, and the immunoprecipitates
synthesized PtdIns(5)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2. Sbrissa et al. (2004)
concluded that VAC14 is an activator of PIKFYVE, and thereby regulates
PtdIns(3,5)P2 synthesis and intracellular membrane homeostasis.

Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Sbrissa et al. (2007) showed that
endogenous PIKFYVE, ARPIKFYVE, and SAC3 (FIG4) formed a stable ternary
complex in HEK293 cells and other mammalian cell lines.

Sbrissa et al. (2008) found that ARPIKFYVE interacted with both SAC3 and
PIKFYVE and concluded that it is the principal organizer of the
PIKFYVE-ARPIKFYVE-SAC3 (PAS) complex.

MAPPING

Gross (2010) mapped the VAC14 to chromosome 16q22.1-q22.2 based on an
alignment of the VAC14 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK056433) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Jin et al. (2008) mapped the mouse Vac14 gene to chromosome 8.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhang et al. (2007) obtained Vac14-null mice at mendelian ratios, but
all died within 2 days of birth due to massive neurodegeneration,
particularly in the midbrain and in peripheral sensory neurons. Cell
bodies of affected neurons were vacuolated, and empty spaces were found
in areas where neurons should have been. Similar vacuoles were found in
cultured Vac14-null neurons and fibroblasts. Defects were observed in
intracellular trafficking, particularly in retrograde
endosome-to-trans-Golgi trafficking. Vac14-null cells showed abnormal
accumulation of PI(3)P and reduced levels of PI(3,5)P2 and PI(5)P
compared with wildtype cells. Overexpression of human FAB1 reversed the
effect of Vac14 deletion in mouse fibroblasts. Zhang et al. (2007) noted
that Fig4-null mice and Vac14-null mice show similar defects in PI(3,5)2
synthesis and acquire profound vacuolation in the same types of neurons.
They speculated that the neurodegeneration observed in both mouse
mutants is due to defects in metabolism of PI(3,5)P2 and/or PI(5)P, and
they concluded that VAC14 and FIG4 control FAB1 activity to maintain
normal levels of PI(3)P, PI(3,5)P2, and PI(5)P.

Mice homozygous for the spontaneous Ingls (infantile gliosis) mutation
exhibit reduced body size and diluted pigmentation. Homozygous Ingls
mice die within 3 weeks of birth and histologically show enlarged brain
ventricles. Jin et al. (2008) identified Ingls as a missense mutation
resulting in substitution of an invariant leu156 with arg within helix B
of HEAT repeat 4 in the Vac14 protein. Western blot analysis of Ingls
brains revealed normal Vac14 protein abundance, but cultured Ingls
fibroblasts showed reduced PtdIns(3,5)P2 levels. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis
showed that the leu156-to-arg mutation disrupted interaction of Vac14
with Fab1 (Pikfyve), but not Fig4.

Mutations affecting the conversion of PI3P to the signaling lipid
PI(3,5)P2 result in spongiform degeneration of mouse brain and are
associated with the human disorders Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Ferguson et al. (2009) reported
accumulation of the proteins Lc3II (MAP1LC3A; 601242), p62 (SQSTM1;
601530), and Lamp2 (309060) in neurons and astrocytes of mice with
mutations in 2 components of the PI(3,5)P2 regulatory complex, Fig4
(609390) and Vac14. Cytoplasmic inclusion bodies containing p62 and
ubiquitinated proteins were present in regions of the mutant brain that
underwent degeneration. Colocalization of p62 and LAMP2 in affected
cells indicated that formation or recycling of the autolysosome may be
impaired. The authors proposed a role for PI(3,5)P2 in autophagy in the
mammalian central nervous system and demonstrated that mutations
affecting PI(3,5)P2 may contribute to inclusion body disease.

611030	TITLE *611030 TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 30C; TMEM30C
;;CDC50, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, C; CDC50C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of yeast Cdc50 family proteins,
which are involved in polarized cell division, Katoh and Katoh (2004)
identified 3 human CDC50 genes, including TMEM30C, which they called
CDC50C. The predicted CDC50C protein contains 341 amino acids. The human
and yeast CDC50 proteins all have 2 transmembrane domains and an
extracellular loop with 3 cysteines and an N-glycosylation site.

Osada et al. (2007) obtained TMEM30C cDNAs by 3-prime RACE of human and
chimpanzee testis RNA. In both species, the TMEM30C transcripts were
truncated due to mutations in splicing or poly(A) signals relative to
the macaque gene, which encodes 2 splice variants derived from 7 or 8
exons that produce proteins with 1 or 2 transmembrane domains,
respectively. In contrast, the major human transcript originates from 3
exons and lacks a stop codon, suggesting it does not produce a
functional protein. A minor human transcript transcribed from 2 exons
encodes a predicted 113-amino acid protein with 1 transmembrane domain.
RT-PCR showed that TMEM30C was expressed exclusively in testis of human,
macaque, and mouse. Expression of exons 5 through 8 in human and exons 6
through 8 in chimpanzee was not detected, suggesting that the
2-transmembrane form of TMEM30C is dispensable in hominoids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2004) determined that the TMEM30C gene contains 7
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2004) mapped the TMEM30C
gene to chromosome 3q12.

EVOLUTION

By phylogenetic analysis, Osada et al. (2007) showed that an accelerated
rate of amino acid substitutions in TMEM30C occurred after the
divergence of chimps and humans from Old World monkeys. They suggested
that the excess of substitutions might result from positive selection
for a new function or, more likely, relaxation of selection, as occurs
in pseudogenes.

603464	TITLE *603464 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 10; CDK10
;;PISSLRE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are CDC2 (116940)-related kinases that
bind to cyclin to form active holoenzymes that play a pivotal role in
the regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle. To identify additional
CDC2-like protein kinases, Brambilla and Draetta (1994) performed RT-PCR
on human tumor cell line mRNA using degenerate oligonucleotides based on
regions conserved among CDC2- related proteins. They used a resulting
PCR product to screen a HeLa cell library and isolated a partial cDNA
encoding a novel protein kinase. The 5-prime end of the cDNA was
obtained using RACE. Brambilla and Draetta (1994) designated the
predicted 360-amino acid protein PISSLRE, based on the amino acid
sequence of the region corresponding to the conserved CDC2 PSTAIRE
motif. PISSLRE contains all the structural elements characteristic of
CDKs and unique extensions at both ends. Sequence comparisons revealed
that it shares 41% and 50% protein sequence identity with CDC2 and
CDC2L1 (176873), respectively. By Northern blot analysis, the authors
determined that PISSLRE was expressed broadly in human tissues as a 2-kb
mRNA. An additional 3.5-kb transcript was observed in some tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using a combination of library screening and 5-prime RACE, Grana et al.
(1994) isolated PISSLRE cDNAs that differed significantly at both ends
from those isolated by Brambilla and Draetta (1994). Brambilla and
Draetta (1994) attributed the differences to alternative splicing. Grana
et al. (1994) were unable to identify any ATG initiation codons upstream
of the sequence encoding the catalytic domain of the putative kinase.
They suggested that translation may initiate at 1 of 3 non-ATG
initiation codons.

Crawford et al. (1999) characterized the genomic structure of PISSLRE
and found that the splicing of the gene is complex. They identified a
variety of different transcripts, including those due to cryptic splice
sites, exon skipping, insertion of intronic sequences, and exon
scrambling.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Bullrich et al. (1995) mapped the
CDK10 gene to 16q24.

(RPP38; 606116), and 40 kD (RPP40; 606117). Patients with scleroderma
(181750) have serum reactive with RNase P, the Th antigen, which is also
referred to as the To antigen, and RPP30 and RPP38 (summary by Jarrous
et al., 1998, 1999).

CLONING

By biochemical purification of RNase P, micropeptide sequence analysis,
and EST database searching, Jarrous et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA
encoding RPP14. The deduced basic protein has 124 amino acids and a
predicted molecular mass of nearly 14 kD. Immunoblot analysis showed
that antibodies to RPP14 or RPP29 precipitate native RNase P.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the RPP14 gene to chromosome 3p14.3 based on an
alignment of the RPP14 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF001175) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

609742	TITLE *609742 INTERLEUKIN 4-INDUCED GENE 1; IL4I1
;;IL4-INDUCED GENE 1;;
FIG1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IL4I1 is induced by treatment with IL4 (147780), a cytokine associated
with antibody responses and, when in excess, autoimmune responses. IL4I1
is most similar to L-amino acid oxidases (LAAOs) and contains several
residues important for substrate binding and catalysis (Chavan et al.,
2002).

CLONING

By low-stringency probing of human genomic DNA with mouse Fig1, followed
by EST database analysis, screening genomic DNA libraries, and RT-PCR
and RACE of IL4-induced human B-cell RNA, Chavan et al. (2002) cloned
human IL4I1, which they called FIG1. The predicted 567-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 63 kD. It contains an
N-terminal signal peptide, a central region that shares homology with
nonmammalian LAAOs, and 3 conserved domains likely to be involved in FAD
binding. The C terminus of human IL4I1 is 63 residues shorter than that
of the mouse protein. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a
1.7-kb transcript primarily in immune tissues, with highest levels in
spleen and thymus, followed by placenta and lung. Expression of IL4I1
was induced by IL4 in human B cells.

Independently, Copie-Bergman et al. (2003) cloned and characterized
IL4I1. RT-PCR analysis indicated that IL4I1 was preferentially expressed
in primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphomas rather than nonmediastinal
diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.

Wiemann et al. (2005) identified an IL4I1 variant, IL4I1-2, containing
the first 2 exons of the upstream NUP62 gene (605815). They determined
that expression of IL4I1-2 is driven by the apparent promoter of NUP62
and is specific to non-B cells, such as testis Sertoli cells and brain
Purkinje cells. The IL4I1 and IL4I1-2 proteins differ only in the length
of the signal sequence, and the processed proteins are identical.

GENE FUNCTION

Mason et al. (2004) showed that IL4I1, like other LAAOs, has a
preference for aromatic amino acid substrates, particularly
phenylalanine. It could be inhibited by aromatic competitors, but not by
nonaromatic LAAO inhibitors. Confocal microscopy demonstrated
colocalization of IL4I1 with lysosomal dyes, confirming predictions
based on its higher enzymatic activity at acidic pH and its N-linked
glycosylation. Mason et al. (2004) proposed that IL4I1 may have an
important role in lysosomal antigen processing and presentation.

Using Western blot, enzymatic, and immunohistochemical analyses,
Boulland et al. (2007) identified IL4I1 as a secreted, N-glycosylated
enzyme located in germinal center macrophages and inflammatory myeloid
cells. Highest enzyme levels were found in dendritic cells. IL4I1
inhibited proliferation of CD4 (186940)-positive, CD8 (see
186910)-positive, and, in particular, memory T cells stimulated by CD3
(see 186740) in a manner dependent on its enzymatic activity and H2O2
production. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the IL4I1 inhibitory
effect was associated with transient downregulation of TCRZ (CD247;
186780) expression.

Santarlasci et al. (2012) noted that IL17A (603149)-producing T-helper
(Th17) cells have a critical pathogenic role in chronic inflammatory
disorders, but they are rarely found in inflammatory sites. Santarlasci
et al. (2012) found that, unlike Th1 cells, human CD161 (KLRB1;
602890)-positive Th17 precursor cells did not proliferate and produce
IL2 (147680) in response to anti-CD3/anti-CD28 (186760) stimulation.
Th17 cells also proliferated poorly in response to IL2, in part due to
lower expression of the transcription factors JUN (165160), FOS
(164810), and NFATC1 (600489) and reduced surface expression of CD3E
(186830) and CD3Z. Microarray and small interfering RNA analyses
revealed high expression of IL4I1 in Th17 precursor cells and showed
that IL4I1 upregulation was strictly dependent on RORC (602943), the
Th17 master regulatory gene. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that Th17
cells also exhibited high CD28 expression that was RORC dependent, and
stimulation of CD28 alone induced IL17 production and IL4I1 mRNA
upregulation. Th17 cells from synovial fluid of patients with juvenile
idiopathic arthritis (see 604302) also expressed higher levels of IL4I1
and CD28 than did Th1 cells. Santarlasci et al. (2012) concluded that
the rarity of human Th17 cells in inflamed tissues results from
RORC-dependent mechanisms that limit their expansion and, therefore,
reduce their potential to cause damage.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chavan et al. (2002) determined that the IL4I1 gene contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chavan et al. (2002) mapped the IL4I1 gene
to chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4, between the FUT1 (211100) and KLK1 (147910)
genes. The 5-prime end of IL4I1 is adjacent to NUP62.

DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

By isotopic in situ hybridization, Rousseau-Merck et al. (1995) assigned
the KOX9 gene to 8q24, where the KOX4 gene (194531) had been previously
mapped. From pulsed field gel electrophoresis data, they concluded that
KOX4 and KOX9 lie within less than 580 kb of each other. They tabulated
a total of 18 different KOX genes that are located in pairs within 9 DNA
fragments of 200 to 580 kb on 7 different chromosomes.

;;GREMLIN;;
CYSTINE KNOT SUPERFAMILY 1, BMP ANTAGONIST 1; CKTSF1B1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a Xenopus expression-cloning screen, Hsu et al. (1998) isolated
GREM1, an antagonist of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP; see 112264)
signaling that is expressed in the neural crest. Gremlin-1 belongs to a
novel gene family that includes the head-inducing factor cerberus (CER1;
603777) and the tumor suppressor DAN (600613). Hsu et al. (1998) showed
that all family members are secreted proteins and that they act as BMP
antagonists in embryonic explants. They also provided support for the
model that gremlin, cerberus, and DAN block BMP signaling by binding
BMPs, preventing them from interacting with their receptors. They
proposed that gremlin, cerberus, and DAN control diverse processes in
growth and development by selectively antagonizing the activities of
different subsets of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta ligands.
By homology searches, Hsu et al. (1998) cloned the human homolog of
Xenopus gremlin. The human gremlin cDNA encodes a predicted 184-amino
acid protein.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, Topol et al.
(2000) mapped the GREM1 gene to human chromosome 15q13-q15.

GENE FUNCTION

Zuniga et al. (1999) reported that the secreted BMP antagonist gremlin
relays the Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) signal from the polarizing
region to the apical ectodermal ridge. Mesenchymal gremlin expression is
lost in limb buds of mouse embryos homozygous for the 'limb deformity'
(ld) mutation, which disrupts establishment of the Shh/Fgf4 (164980)
feedback loop. Grafting gremlin-expressing cells into ld mutant limb
buds rescued Fgf4 expression and restored the Shh/Fgf4 feedback loop.
Analysis of Shh-null mutant embryos revealed that Shh signaling is
required for maintenance of gremlin and formin (FMN1; 136535), the gene
disrupted by the ld mutations. In contrast, formin, gremlin, and Fgf4
activation were independent of Shh signaling. Zuniga et al. (1999)
concluded that the study uncovered the cascade by which the SHH signal
is relayed from the posterior mesenchyme to the apical ectodermal ridge
and established that formin-dependent activation of the BMP antagonist
gremlin is sufficient to induce Fgf4 and establish the SHH/Fgf4 feedback
loop.

Vertebrate limb outgrowth is driven by a positive feedback loop
involving SHH, gremlin, and FGF4. By overexpressing individual
components of the loop at a time after these genes are normally
downregulated in chicken embryos, Scherz et al. (2004) found that Shh no
longer maintains gremlin in the posterior limb. Shh-expressing cells and
their descendants cannot express gremlin. The proliferation of these
descendants forms a barrier separating the Shh signal from
gremlin-expressing cells, which breaks down the Shh-Fgf4 loop and
thereby affects limb size and provides a mechanism explaining regulative
properties of the limb bud.

Developmentally regulated programmed cell death sculpts the limbs and
other embryonic organs in vertebrates. In chickens and mice, Bmps
trigger apoptosis of the interdigital mesenchyme, leading to freed
digits, whereas in ducks, Bmp antagonists inhibit the apoptotic program,
resulting in webbed feet. Weatherbee et al. (2006) found the bat C.
perspicillata utilizes a unique combination of high Fgf8 (600483) and
gremlin expression to maintain interdigit tissue in the forelimb,
resulting in simultaneously elevated Fgf signaling and inhibited Bmp
signaling.

Wordinger et al. (2007) studied the effects of altered BMP signaling on
intraocular pressure (IOP) in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG; see
137760). They found that the human trabecular meshwork (TM) synthesized
and secreted BMP4 (112262) as well as expressed the BMP receptor
subtypes BMPR1 (see 601299) and BMPR2 (600799). TM cells responded to
exogenous BMP4 by phosphorylating SMAD signaling proteins (see 601595).
Cultured human TM cells treated with TGFB2 (190220) significantly
increased fibronectin (FN; 135600) levels, and BMP4 blocked this FN
induction. There was significant elevation of mRNA and protein levels of
the BMP antagonist gremlin in glaucomatous TM cells. In addition,
gremlin was present in human aqueous humor. Gremlin blocked the negative
effect of BMP4 on TGFB2 induction of FN. Addition of recombinant gremlin
to the medium of ex vivo perfusion-cultured human eye anterior segments
caused the glaucoma phenotype of elevated IOP. Wordinger et al. (2007)
concluded that these results were consistent with the hypothesis that,
in POAG, elevated expression of gremlin by TM cells inhibited BMP4
antagonism of TGFB2 and led to increased extracellular matrix deposition
and elevated IOP.

Limb development is regulated by epithelial-mesenchymal feedback loops
between SHH and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling involving the
bone morphogenetic protein antagonist gremlin-1. By combining mouse
molecular genetics with mathematical modeling, Benazet et al. (2009)
showed that BMP4 first initiates and SHH then propagates
epithelial-mesenchymal feedback signaling through differential
transcriptional regulation of Grem1 to control digit specification. This
switch occurs by linking a fast BMP4/GREM1 module to the slower
SHH/GREM1/FGF epithelial-mesenchymal feedback loop. This self-regulatory
signaling network results in robust regulation of distal limb
development that is able to compensate for variations by
interconnectivity among the 3 signaling pathways.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 8 Ashkenazi Jewish families segregating autosomal
dominant hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome mapping to chromosome
15q13.3 (HMPS1; 601228), Jaeger et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity
for an approximately 40-kb duplication centered on chr. 15:30.77 Mb that
was not found in 188 unselected Ashkenazi controls or in 935 controls
from the Colorectal Tumour Gene Identification (CORGI) study. PCR
amplification across the duplication breakpoints mapped it to chr.
15:30,752,231-30,792,051 (NCBI36), and the change was found to be a
simple tandem tail-head duplication with insertion of a 30-bp sequence
of unknown origin that had no homology to known sequences between the
duplicons. The duplication extended from intron 2 of the SCG5 gene to a
site just upstream of the GREM1 CpG island; however, only the normal
SCG5 mRNA species was found, and there were no significant differences
in SCG5 expression compared to controls. In contrast, markedly increased
GREM1 transcript levels were detected in the normal epithelium of HMPS
patients compared to controls, and allele-specific expression analysis
showed significantly increased expression of the duplicated allele in
HMPS crypts. In normal colorectal crypts of controls and unaffected
relatives, GREM1 expression was restricted to intestinal subepithelial
myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) at the crypt base, whereas in normal colorectal
crypts of HMPS patients, GREM1 was expressed not only in basal ISEMFs
but also at very high levels in epithelial cells, predominantly
colonocytes, with expression extending most of the way up the sides of
the crypts. Increased GREM1 expression was also seen in HMPS polyps, but
to a lesser extent than in normal epithelium. Jaeger et al. (2012)
demonstrated that a 3-kb region within the duplication (chr.
15:30,779,000-30,782,000, NCBI36) enhanced GREM1 expression 4-fold in
the SW948 CRC cell line and that the region interacts directly with the
GREM1 promoter. Increased GREM1 expression was predicted to cause
reduced BMP (see 112264) pathway activity, a mechanism that also
underlies tumorigenesis in juvenile polyposis of the large bowel
(174900).

ANIMAL MODEL

During limb outgrowth, signaling by BMPs must be moderated to maintain
the signaling loop between the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) and the
apical ectodermal ridge (AER). Gremlin, an extracellular BMP antagonist,
has been proposed to fulfill this function and therefore be important in
limb patterning. Khokha et al. (2003) tested this model directly by
mutating the mouse gene encoding gremlin. In the mutant limb, the
feedback loop between the ZPA and the AER was interrupted, resulting in
abnormal skeletal pattern. The phenotype is apparently identical to that
of ld, which results from a mutation in the Fmn1 gene (136535). The
relationship between Grem1 and Fmn1 is interesting because of their
proximity in the mouse genome. The Fmn1 transcript comprises a large
number of exons with the most 3-prime exon located approximately 40 kb
from the gremlin open reading frame. Given the apparently identical
phenotype of ld mice to gremlin mutant mice and the proximity of Fmn1 to
Grem1, Khokha et al. (2003) tested whether gremlin would complement ld.
They found that gremlin fails to complement ld and thus identified
another ld allele. Although a complex interaction between Fmn1 and
gremlin is possible, Khokha et al. (2003) favored the idea that the ld
mutations affect gremlin expression directly and that they lie in
cis-regulatory elements for gremlin expression.

Limb bud outgrowth is driven by signals in a positive feedback loop
involving fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) genes, Sonic hedgehog (Shh;
600725), and Grem1. Precise termination of these signals is essential to
restrict limb bud size. That the sequence in mouse limb buds is
different from that in chick limb buds drove Verheyden and Sun (2008) to
explore alternative mechanisms. By analyzing compound mouse mutants
defective in genes comprising the positive loop, Verheyden and Sun
(2008) provided genetic evidence that Fgf signaling can repress Grem1
expression, revealing a novel Fgf/Grem1 inhibitory loop. The repression
occurs in both mouse and chick limb buds and is dependent on high Fgf
activity. These data supported a mechanism where the positive Fgf/Shh
loop drives outgrowth and an increase in Fgf signaling, which triggers
the Fgf/Grem1 inhibitory loop. The inhibitory loop then operates to
terminate outgrowth signals in the order observed in either mouse or
chick limb buds. Verheyden and Sun (2008) concluded that their study
unveils the concept of a self-promoting and self-terminating circuit
that may be used to attain proper tissue size in a broad spectrum of
developmental and regenerative settings. Verheyden and Sun (2008)
demonstrated that Fgf8 (600483) repression of Fgf4 (164980) expression
is dependent on Grem1 but not Shh.

605675	TITLE *605675 RING FINGER PROTEIN 14; RNF14
;;ANDROGEN RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 54; ARA54
DESCRIPTION The RING finger motif is a unique zinc-chelating domain involved in
mediating protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. Using the
sequence of the partial cDNA clone HFB30 isolated by Ueki et al. (1998)
to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library, Ueki et al. (1999) cloned
the full-length cDNA, which encoded a novel ring finger protein, RNF14.
The deduced 474-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
approximately 53 kD. RT-PCR analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of
RNF14 in a wide variety of human tissues.

Kang et al. (1999) independently cloned RNF14, which they called ARA54
(androgen receptor-associated protein-54), by a yeast 2-hybrid screen of
a prostate cDNA library. Northern blot analysis detected a major 3-kb
transcript, with highest expression in testis, followed by thymus,
spleen, colon, prostate, and uterus. Low expression was detected in
small intestine and blood leukocytes. The RNF14 transcript was also
strongly detected in 2 other prostate cell lines. A second transcript of
2 kb was detected in testis only. Kang et al. (1999) demonstrated that
RNF14 can function as a coactivator for androgen-dependent transcription
on both wildtype and mutant androgen receptor (313700). They also showed
that in the presence of a certain amount of 17-beta-estradiol or
hydroxyflutamide, the transcriptional activity of a specific AR mutant
was significantly enhanced, whereas that of wildtype and another AR
mutant was not. The authors suggested that both RNF14 and the positions
of the AR mutation might contribute to the specificity of AR-mediated
transactivation.

Ueki et al. (1999) determined that the RNF14 gene contains 9 exons and
spans approximately 20 kb of genomic DNA. By somatic cell hybrid and
radiation hybrid analyses, Ueki et al. (1999) mapped the RNF14 gene to
chromosome 5q23.3-q31.1.

613914	TITLE *613914 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 746; ZNF746
;;PARKIN-INTERACTING SUBSTRATE; PARIS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using parkin (PARK2; 602544) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a
human brain cDNA library, Shin et al. (2011) cloned ZNF746, which they
called PARIS. The deduced 644-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal
Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) and a C-terminal C2HC/C2H2-type zinc
finger. Northern blot analysis of human tissues and immunoblot analysis
of mouse tissues showed ubiquitous expression of PARIS.
Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse brain showed that Paris localized
to neurons. PARIS colocalized with parkin in cell bodies in primary rat
cortical neurons and in human SH-SY5Y dopaminergic-like cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Shin et al. (2011) showed that PARIS coimmunoprecipitated with parkin
from whole human striatum or mouse brain. Domain mapping indicated that
parkin bound to the C-terminal domain of PARIS. In SH-SY5Y cells, parkin
ubiquitinated epitope-tagged PARIS on lys48 in the presence of various
E2 enzymes (see 601661), leading to PARIS degradation via the proteasome
system. PARIS levels were elevated in the cingulate cortex of patients
with autosomal recessive parkinson disease (PD) (600116), in the
striatum and substantia nigra of patients with sporadic PD, and in an
adult mouse PD model following conditional parkin knockout. Using a pool
of random oligonucleotides with immobilized PARIS, followed by
electrophoretic mobility shift assays, Shin et al. (2011) showed that
PARIS bound the core sequence TATTTT(T/G), which is an insulin response
sequence (IRS) designated the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK;
see 261680)-like motif (PLM). PARIS also bound the 5-prime region of the
transcriptional coactivator PGC1-alpha (PPARGC1A; 604517), which
contains 3 IRS/PLM elements. PARIS repressed PGC1-alpha expression in
SH-SY5Y cells and in control and PD postmortem striatum, and it altered
the expression of a subset of PGC1-alpha-regulated genes, particularly
NRF1 (600879). Conditional parkin knockout in mouse led to Pgc1-alpha
and Nrf1 downregulation concomitant with Paris upregulation. Knockout of
Paris expression in parkin-knockout mice reduced the degeneration of
dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Conversely, overexpression of Paris in
substantia nigra of wildtype mice resulted in degeneration of DA neurons
and reduced expression of Pgcl1-alpha and Nrf1. Shin et al. (2011)
concluded that PARIS is predominantly expressed in the nigrostriatal
pathway and may contribute to the pathophysiology of PD.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the ZNF746 gene to chromosome 7q36.1 based on an
alignment of the ZNF746 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK055975) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

604993	TITLE *604993 PRECURSOR mRNA-PROCESSING FACTOR 18, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; PRPF18
;;PRP18
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pre-mRNA splicing occurs in 2 sequential transesterification steps.
PRPF18 is a pre-mRNA splicing factor required for the second catalytic
step of splicing (Horowitz and Krainer, 1997).

CLONING

By PCR analysis of a HeLa cell cDNA library using degenerate PCR primers
based on yeast, rice, and nematode Prp18 sequences, Horowitz and Krainer
(1997) obtained a cDNA encoding human PRP18. The deduced 342-amino acid
human PRP18 protein is 91 amino acids longer than the yeast Prp18
protein, but they share 31% amino acid identity. Homology is strongest
in the C-terminal third of the proteins. Western blot analysis showed
that PRP18 is expressed as a 40-kD protein, and anti-PRP18 cross-reacted
with a 55-kD protein. The 55-kD protein did not appear to be either a
modified form or an alternatively spliced form of PRP18 and was shown to
be associated with RNU4 and RNU6.

GENE FUNCTION

Horowitz and Krainer (1997) found that immunodepletion of PRP18 from
cell extracts abolished the second step of pre-mRNA splicing, and
recombinant PRP18 restored the activity for several pre-mRNAs. Binding
analyses suggested that PRP18 binds transiently to the spliceosome just
before the second transesterification reaction and after other stages
within the second step. Functional analyses indicated that yeast Prp18
can substitute for human PRP18 in the splicing reaction but not vice
versa.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PRP18
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP U51990).

608321	TITLE *608321 TIR DOMAIN-CONTAINING ADAPTOR MOLECULE 2; TICAM2
;;TOLL/INTERLEUKIN-1 RECEPTOR DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN; TIRP;;
TRIF-RELATED ADAPTOR MOLECULE; TRAM
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TIRP is a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (IL1R; 147810) (TIR)
domain-containing adaptor protein involved in Toll receptor signaling
(see TLR4; 603030).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for TIR domain-containing proteins, Bin et
al. (2003) identified a cDNA encoding TIRP. The predicted 235-amino acid
protein, which is 70% identical to the mouse protein, has a central TIR
domain that is most similar to that of TRIF (607601). Northern blot
analysis indicated that TIRP is expressed ubiquitously. Transcripts of
3.8, 3.6, and 2.0 kb were detected, and they were differentially
expressed in tissues. Independently, Fitzgerald et al. (2003) also
cloned TIRP, which they called TRAM.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Bin et al. (2003) found that TIRP
interacted with IL1R1, IL1RAP (602626), TIRAP (606252), and TRIF, but
not with MYD88 (602170), TLR2 (603028), or TLR4. Among IRAKs, TIRP
interacted with wildtype IRAK2 (603034) and IRAKM (IRAK3; 604459), both
of which lack kinase activity, but it interacted only with
kinase-inactive mutants of IRAK1 (300283) and IRAK4 (606883). Analysis
of deletion mutants determined that the TIR domain of TIRP interacted
specifically with the TRAF domain of TRAF6 (602355); TIRP did not
interact with TRAF5 (602356). Reporter gene analysis indicated that TIRP
weakly activated nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011) through IL1R1
or IL1RAP, and it could be inhibited by dominant-negative mutants of
IRAK1, IRAK2, TRAF6, and IKKB (IKBKB; 603258).

Using small interfering RNA studies, Fitzgerald et al. (2003) determined
that, like TRIF, TRAM interacts with and activates IRF3 (603734).
However, it does so only through the TLR4 pathway, not the TLR3 (603029)
pathway, and in a TRIF-dependent manner.

McGettrick et al. (2006) found that TRAM was phosphorylated by protein
kinase C-epsilon (PRKCE; 176975) after stimulation of monocytic cells
with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Mutation of ser6 or ser16 of TRAM to
alanine blocked phosphorylation, whereas mutation of ser10 or ser14 had
no effect. TRAM phosphorylation by PRKCE resulted in reduced membrane
expression of TRAM and activation of NFKB in human embryonic kidney
cells. Murine embryonic fibroblasts lacking Prkce exhibited a disruption
of Tram-dependent pathways for activation of Irf3 and induction of Ccl5
(187011). TRAM containing a ser16-to-ala mutation was unable to fully
reconstitute signaling in Tram-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts.
McGettrick et al. (2006) concluded that TRAM is a key target of PRKCE in
the LPS-TLR4 signaling pathway.

MAPPING

Fitzgerald et al. (2003) stated that the TRAM gene maps to chromosome 5.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yamamoto et al. (2003) generated Tram-deficient mice, which showed
defects in cytokine production, notably production of IFNB (147640), in
response to TLR4, but not other TLR ligands. Studies of Tram-deficient
embryonic fibroblasts indicated that Tram is not involved in IL1R
signaling. Yamamoto et al. (2003) concluded that TRAM provides
specificity for MYD88-independent TLR4 signaling.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned KIAA1082. The deduced protein
shares significant similarity with rat Tsga (JMJD1A; 611512), a protein
expressed only in testis. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate to high
expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific brain regions
examined.

Lai et al. (2000) identified C5ORF7 within a region of chromosome 5q
frequently deleted in malignant myelomas. By EST analysis, screening a
bone marrow cDNA library, 5-prime RACE, and RT-PCR, they cloned C5ORF7.
The deduced 1,417-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
about 155 kD. It contains a putative zinc finger domain and a bipartite
nuclear localization signal. Northern blot analysis of lymphoid tissues
detected a transcript of about 7.5 kb. RNA dot blot analysis detected
expression in all 50 tissues examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Lai et al. (2000) determined that the
C5ORF7 gene contains 24 exons and spans about 64 kb.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Kikuno et al. (1999) mapped KIAA1082 to
chromosome 5. By genomic sequence analysis, Lai et al. (2000) mapped the
C5ORF7 gene to chromosome 5q31.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hodzic et al. (2006) identified 8 paralogs
of the TBC1D3 gene (see 607741) on chromosome 17, including TBC1D3F,
which they called paralog E. All TBC1D3 paralogs encode a deduced
549-amino acid protein, but missense changes at 6 residues among the
paralogs result in 5 different TBC1D3 isoforms. The TBC1D3F and TBC1D3E
(610808) genes encode identical proteins. The TBC1D3 paralogs appeared
to be differentially expressed in human tissues.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hodzic et al. (2006) identified 8 TBC1D3
paralogs, including the TBC1D3E gene, on chromosome 17q12. The paralogs
are clustered in 2 groups of 4 genes, and each cluster spans
approximately 400 kb.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Fujiwara et al. (2001) described a patient with a subepidermal
blistering disease that resembled bullous pemphigoid both clinically and
pathologically. Using the patient serum, they obtained a cDNA clone for
the antigenic protein, which they called epiplakin, from a human
keratinocyte expression library. They obtained full-length EPPK1 cDNA
from HeLa cell and genomic cDNA libraries. The deduced protein contains
5,065 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of more than 552
kD. Epiplakin has 13 domains that are homologous to the C-terminal B
domain of desmoplakin (125647). B domains 9 through 13 and their
preceding 358-residue linker regions form 5 repeats that share almost
100% identity and contain a 7-residue epitope recognized by the patient
serum. Unlike desmoplakin, epiplakin lacks a coiled-coil rod domain, an
N-terminal domain, and a dimerization motif, which suggests that it
exists as a single-chain structure. Northern dot blot analysis detected
expression in a wide variety of tissues. Highest expression was in
liver, small intestine, colon, salivary glands, stomach, and appendix,
with lower expression in placenta, lung, brain, and bone marrow.
Immunofluorescence staining of human skin detected epiplakin in the
entire epidermis, with prominent staining of basal keratinocytes.
Staining was found in all layers of the stratified epithelium of
esophagus, in acinous cells of the parotid gland, and in mucous
epithelial cells of the stomach and colon.

;;RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE SMALL SUBUNIT 2-LIKE, p53-INDUCIBLE; P53R2;;
p53-INDUCIBLE AND RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE SMALL SUBUNIT 2-LIKE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RRM2B gene encodes the small subunit of p53 (191170)-inducible
ribonucleotide reductase, a heterotetrameric enzyme responsible for de
novo conversion of ribonucleoside diphosphates into the corresponding
deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates that are essential for DNA synthesis
(Bourdon et al., 2007).

CLONING

The p53 gene is frequently inactivated in human cancers. By using
differential display to examine mRNAs in a human colon cancer cell line
carrying a highly regulated wildtype p53 expression system, Tanaka et
al. (2000) detected a 5.5-kb transcript that was inducible by wildtype
p53 but not mutant p53. Using the differential display fragment
representing this transcript as a probe to screen a skeletal muscle cDNA
library, they isolated a cDNA sequence that incorporated an open reading
frame of 351 amino acids with 80% identity to the small subunit of human
ribonucleotide reductase (R2; 180390). Comparison of this sequence,
which they called p53R2 for 'p53-inducible ribonucleotide reductase
small subunit 2 homolog,' with those of yeast RNR2 and RNR4 revealed 60%
and 40% identity, respectively. Tanaka et al. (2000) considered p53R2 to
be a human counterpart of yeast RNR2. The protein has a ribonucleotide
reductase small subunit signature and 2 putative nuclear localization
signal sequences.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tanaka et al. (2000) found that the p53R2 gene consists of 9 exons and
spans a 30-kb genomic region. Electromobility shift assays identified a
20-nucleotide region in intron 1 as the p53 binding site.

MAPPING

Tanaka et al. (2000) mapped the p53R2 gene to chromosome 8q23.1 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Tanaka et al. (2000) found that expression of p53R2, but not R2, was
induced by ultraviolet and gamma-irradiation and adriamycin treatment in
a wildtype p53-dependent manner. Induction of p53R2 in p53-deficient
cells caused G2/M arrest and protected cells from death in response to
adriamycin. Inhibition of endogenous p53R2 expression in cells that had
an intact p53-dependent DNA damage checkpoint reduced ribonucleotide
reductase activity, DNA repair, and cell survival after exposure to
various genotoxins. Tanaka et al. (2000) demonstrated nuclear
accumulation of p53R2 protein in response to genotoxic stress induced by
gamma-irradiation. Tanaka et al. (2000) concluded that p53R2 encodes a
ribonucleotide reductase that is directly involved in the p53 checkpoint
for repair of damaged DNA. The discovery of p53R2 clarified a
relationship between a ribonucleotide reductase activity involved in
repair of damaged DNA and tumor suppression by p53. Tanaka et al. (2000)
proposed that inactivation of p53 directly interferes with the
transcription of p53R2 in response to DNA damage, with the result that
ribonucleotide reductase activity is insufficient for normal DNA repair.
Faulty regulation of p53R2 might also enhance misincorporation of
deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) and dysregulation of DNA
repair machinery and thereby increase the frequency of mutations. Tanaka
et al. (2000) suggested that the genomic instability often seen in
tumors lacking wildtype p53 may reflect dysfunction of ribonucleotide
reductase due to the failure of p53R2 induction.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Mitochondrial DNA Depletion Syndrome 8A (Encephalomyopathic
Type with Renal Tubulopathy)

In 7 patients from 4 families with severe autosomal recessive
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome-8A (MTDPS8A; 612075),
associated with renal tubulopathy, Bourdon et al. (2007) identified
homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the RRM2B gene (see,
e.g., 604712.0001-604712.0005). All patients had 1 to 2% residual mtDNA
in skeletal muscle and died in the first months of life with severe
lactic acidosis. Respiratory chain complex activities were severely
decreased in muscle from these patients. The findings indicated that
RRM2B plays a crucial role in dNTP supply, especially for the synthesis
of mtDNA.

- Mitochondrial DNA Depletion Syndrome 8B (MNGIE Type)

Shaibani et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the RRM2B gene (R110H, 604712.0008; R121H, 604712.0009) in
a 42-year-old woman with mtDNA depletion syndrome-8B, manifest as a
neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (see 612075). The authors stated
that this was the oldest reported patient with RRM2B mutations and that
her clinical course was different from that reported previously in
patients with MNGIE.

- Autosomal Dominant Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia
5

By linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing in a large
North American family with mild autosomal dominant progressive external
ophthalmoplegia-5 (PEOA5; 613077), Tyynismaa et al. (2009) identified a
heterozygous mutation in the RRM2B gene (R327X; 604712.0006) that
segregated with the disorder. Affected members of an unrelated Hungarian
family carried the same mutation, but there was no evidence of a common
origin.

By direct sequencing of the RRM2B gene in 75 unrelated probands with PEO
in whom mutations in other known PEO-related genes had been excluded,
Fratter et al. (2011) identified 3 different heterozygous truncating
mutations in the RRM2B gene (see, e.g., 604712.0010 and 604712.0011) in
7 (9.3%) patients. The findings suggested that truncating RRM2B
mutations are rather frequent in familial PEO with mtDNA deletions.
Three additional patients were found to carry 3 different heterozygous
missense variants, but the pathogenicity of the variants was considered
provisional in the absence of further supporting evidence.

ANIMAL MODEL

To determine whether ribonucleotide reductase is involved in DNA repair
by supplying deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) for resting cells in vivo,
Kimura et al. (2003) generated a strain of mice lacking Rrm2b. These
mice developed normally until they were weaned but from then on had
growth retardation and early mortality. Pathologic examination indicated
that multiple organs had failed, and all Rrm2b-null mice died from
severe renal failure by the age of 14 weeks. TUNEL staining showed a
greater number of apoptotic cells in kidneys of 8-week-old null mice
relative to wildtype. p53 (191170) was activated in kidney tissues of
the null mice, leading to transcriptional induction of p53 target genes.
Embryonic fibroblasts from null mice became immortal much earlier than
wildtype embryonic fibroblasts. dNTP pools were severely attenuated in
embryonic fibroblasts from null mice under oxidative stress. Rrm2b
deficiency caused higher rates of spontaneous mutation in the kidneys of
null mice. The results suggested that p53R2 has a pivotal role in
maintaining dNTP levels for repair of DNA in resting cells. Impairment
of this pathway may enhance spontaneous mutation frequency and activate
p53-dependent apoptotic pathways in vivo, causing severe renal failure,
growth retardation, and early mortality.

Bourdon et al. (2007) found that 12-week-old Rrm2b-null mice had
markedly decreased mtDNA content in kidney (5.57% of controls), muscle
(5.24%), and liver (21%).

In 3 sibs, born of consanguineous Moroccan parents, with mitochondrial
DNA depletion syndrome-8A (MTDPS8A; 612075), manifest as
encephalomyopathy and renal tubulopathy, Bourdon et al. (2007)
identified a homozygous 850C-T transition in the RRM2B gene, resulting
in a gln284-to-ter (Q284X) substitution. The substitution resulted in
the deletion of the last 68 C-terminal residues of the protein,
including part of the an alpha-helix as well as the heptapeptide
involved in the binding to R1. The sibs had hypotonia and lactic
acidosis and died within the first months of life. Severe mtDNA
depletion (less than 1% of controls) was found in muscle of 1 the sibs.

The sibs had lactic acidemia, hypotonia, tubulopathy, and seizures. Only
2% of normal mtDNA levels was detected in the muscle of 1 of the sibs.
Both died at 2 months of age.

MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8A (ENCEPHALOMYOPATHIC TYPE WITH
RENAL TUBULOPATHY)
RRM2B, GLU194LYS

In 2 French infants with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome-8A
(612075), manifest as encephalomyopathy with renal tubulopathy, Bourdon
et al. (2007) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
RRM2B gene: a 580G-A transition, resulting in a glu194-to-lys (E194K)
substitution, and a splice site mutation (604712.0002). Residue 194 is
involved in iron binding.

MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8A (ENCEPHALOMYOPATHIC TYPE WITH
RENAL TUBULOPATHY)
RRM2B, 3-BP DEL, 253GAG

In a French infant with severe mitochondrial DNA depletion with renal
tubulopathy (612075), Bourdon et al. (2007) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the RRM2B gene: a 3-bp deletion
(253delGAG), resulting in an in-frame deletion of glu85, and C236F
(604712.0005). The patient had neonatal hypotonia and increased plasma
and CSF lactate; she died at age 3 months. Muscle histology showed
ragged-red fibers, and mtDNA content was about 1% of normal. The
deletion of glu85 was predicted to disrupt the local subdomain structure
and the dimerization interface between R1 and R2.

RRM2B, CYS236PHE

In a French infant with severe mitochondrial DNA depletion with renal
tubulopathy (612075), Bourdon et al. (2007) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the RRM2B gene: a 707G-T transversion,
resulting in a cys236-to-phe (C236F) substitution, and a 3-bp deletion
(604712.0004).

PROGRESSIVE EXTERNAL OPHTHALMOPLEGIA WITH MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DELETIONS,
AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, 5
RRM2B, ARG327TER

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with autosomal dominant
progressive external ophthalmoplegia-5 (PEOA5; 613077), Tyynismaa et al.
(2009) identified a heterozygous 979C-T transition in the last exon of
the RRM2B gene, resulting in an arg327-to-ter (R327X) substitution. The
substitution was predicted to result in a protein lacking the last 25
amino acids. One family was North American of European origin, and the
second was Hungarian. The mutation was not observed in 380 control
European chromosomes, and there was no evidence of a founder effect. The
phenotype was characterized by late-onset of mild ophthalmoplegia and
mild muscle weakness. Skeletal muscle biopsies showed mtDNA deletions,
but normal mtDNA copy numbers. RNA studies showed that the R328X mRNA
escaped nonsense-mediated decay, and that the mutant protein was
expressed and stable. The findings suggested that the mutant RRM2B
protein can compete with wildtype in binding to ribonucleotide
reductase, causing a dominant-negative or gain-of-function effect.

MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8A (ENCEPHALOMYOPATHIC TYPE WITH
RENAL TUBULOPATHY)
RRM2B, GLY229VAL

In 2 Sudanese brothers, born of consanguineous parents, with
encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (612075),
Kollberg et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 686G-T transversion in
exon 7 of the RRM2B gene, resulting in a gly229-to-val (G229V)
substitution in the diferric iron center of the protein. Each unaffected
parent was heterozygous for the mutation. The phenotype was severe, with
hypotonia, seizures, poor visual contact, and lactic acidosis, and both
patients died by 5 months of age. One boy developed a proximal renal
tubulopathy. Southern blot analysis of patient cells showed severe mtDNA
depletion, about 1 to 4% of normal controls.

.0008
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8B (MNGIE TYPE)
RRM2B, ARG110HIS

In a 42-year-old woman with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome-8B,
manifest as mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome
(MNGIE; see 612075), Shaibani et al. (2009) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the RRM2B gene: a 329G-A transition
resulting in an arg110-to-his (R110H) substitution, and a 362G-A
transition resulting in an arg121-to-his (R121H; 604712.0009)
substitution. Both mutations occurred in highly conserved residues. The
patient developed recurrent nausea, vomiting, and weight loss at age 30
years. At age 37, she developed restriction of eye movements, ptosis,
dysarthria, unsteady gait, muscle weakness, and areflexia consistent
with a peripheral neuropathy. Skeletal muscle showed mtDNA depletion
(12% of controls). Shaibani et al. (2009) noted that this was the oldest
reported patient with RRM2B mutations and that her clinical course was
different from that reported previously in patients with MNGIE. The
findings also broadened the phenotype associated with RRM2B mutations to
include an MNGIE-like picture.

PROGRESSIVE EXTERNAL OPHTHALMOPLEGIA WITH MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DELETIONS,
AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, 5
RRM2B, 1-BP DEL, 950T

In 3 unrelated patients with PEOA5 (613077), Fratter et al. (2011)
identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (950delT) in the RRM2B gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination at leu317. The
patients had onset at ages 30, 53, and 46 years, and all had a family
history of the disorder. All had PEO and ptosis, but additional variable
features in 2 patients included fatigue, ataxia, proximal myopathy,
dysphagia, and glaucoma. Skeletal muscle biopsies of the probands showed
a mosaic defect of cytochrome c oxidase activity and multiple mtDNA
deletions. The mutation was not found in 352 control alleles.

RRM2B, 1-BP DUP, 965A

In 3 unrelated patients with PEOA5 (613077), Fratter et al. (2011)
identified a heterozygous 1-bp duplication (965dupA) in the RRM2B gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The patients had
onset at ages 30, 54, and 26 years, and all had a family history of the
disorder. All had PEO and fatigue, but additional features were variable
and included diabetes, gastrointestinal symptoms, dysphagia, dysphonia,
and proximal myopathy. Skeletal muscle biopsies of the probands showed a
mosaic defect of cytochrome c oxidase activity and multiple mtDNA
deletions. The mutation was not found in 352 control alleles.

.0012
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
RRM2B, PHE202LEU

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to progressive external ophthalmoplegia has not been
confirmed.

In a 14-year-old patient with early-onset progressive external
ophthalmoplegia at age 4 and hearing loss, Fratter et al. (2011)
identified compound heterozygous changes in the RRM2B gene: a 606T-A
transversion resulting in a phe202-to-leu (F202L) substitution, and an
817G-A transition resulting in a gly273-to-ser (G273S; 604712.0013)
substitution. Functional studies of the variants were not performed.
Skeletal muscle biopsy showed a mosaic defect of cytochrome c oxidase
activity and multiple mtDNA deletions. Neither variant was found in 352
control alleles, and both occurred in conserved residues. There was no
family history of a similar disorder, but information on the parents was
not provided. The findings suggested recessive inheritance of the
disorder.

RRM2B, GLY273SER

See 604712.0012 and Fratter et al. (2011).

.0014
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
RRM2B, PRO33SER

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to progressive external ophthalmoplegia has not been
confirmed.

In a 43-year-old Japanese man, born of consanguineous parents, with
adult-onset progressive external ophthalmoplegia, Takata et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 341G-A transition in the RRM2B gene, resulting
in a pro33-to-ser (P33S) substitution in a highly conserved residue in
the N terminus. The variant was found by whole-exome sequencing in
combination with runs of homozygosity analysis. Each unaffected parent
was heterozygous for the mutation, which was found in 1 of 718 control
chromosomes of Japanese origin. Functional studies of the variant were
not performed. The patient presented with hearing loss at age 16 years,
and later developed ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and muscle weakness. He
also had pigmentary degeneration of the retina and gonadal atrophy.
Other features included depressed mood, anxiety, and hypochondriacal
complaints. Muscle biopsy showed marked variation of fiber size,
ragged-red fibers, COX-negative fibers, and multiple mtDNA deletions.
There was no family history of a similar disorder. Mutations in other
candidate genes were excluded. Takata et al. (2011) suggested that this
was the first case of recessive inheritance of PEO due to RRM2B
mutations.

613113	TITLE *613113 NEUROFIBROMIN 1; NF1
;;NEUROFIBROMIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The NF1 gene encodes neurofibromin, a cytoplasmic protein that is
predominantly expressed in neurons, Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes, and
leukocytes. It is a multidomain molecule with the capacity to regulate
several intracellular processes, including the RAS (see 190020)-cyclic
AMP pathway, the ERK (600997)/MAP (see 600178) kinase cascade, adenylyl
cyclase, and cytoskeletal assembly (summary by Trovo-Marqui and Tajara,
2006).

CLONING

Buchberg et al. (1990) sequenced a portion of the murine NF1 gene and
showed that the predicted amino acid sequence is nearly the same as the
corresponding region of the human NF1 gene product. Computer searches
identified homology between the mouse NF1 gene and the Ira1 and Ira2
genes identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which negatively regulate
the RAS-cyclic AMP pathway. RAS proteins are involved in the control of
proliferation and differentiation in mammalian cells. Their activity is
modulated by their ability to bind and hydrolyze guanine nucleotides.
GTP-binding activates RAS, whereas GTP hydrolysis inactivates RAS.
Mutant forms of RAS found in human tumors have greatly decreased GTPase
activity, resulting in accumulation of RAS in the GTP-bound active form.

Xu et al. (1990) extended the known open reading frame of the human NF1
gene by cDNA walking and sequencing. The new sequence predicted 2,485
amino acids of the NF1 peptide. A 360-residue region showed significant
similarity to the catalytic domains of both human and bovine
GTPase-activating protein (GAP; 139150). Xu et al. (1990) suggested that
NF1 encodes a cytoplasmic GAP-like protein that may be involved in the
control of cell growth by interacting with proteins such as the RAS gene
product.

Marchuk et al. (1991) reported an extensive cDNA walk resulting in the
cloning of the complete coding region of the NF1 transcript. Analysis of
the sequences revealed an open reading frame of 2,818 amino acids,
although alternatively spliced products may code for different protein
isoforms.

To study the NF1 gene product, Gutmann et al. (1991) raised antibodies
against both fusion proteins and synthetic peptides. A specific protein
of about 250 kD was identified by both immunoprecipitation and
immunoblotting. The protein was found in all tissues and cell lines
examined and was detected in human, rat, and mouse tissues. Based on the
homology between the NF1 gene product and members of the GAP
superfamily, the name NF1-GAP-related protein (NF1-GRD) was suggested.
DeClue et al. (1991) raised rabbit antisera to a bacterially synthesized
peptide corresponding to the GAP-related domain of NF1 (NF1-GRD). The
sera specifically detected a 280-kD protein in lysates of HeLa cells.
This protein corresponded to the NF1 gene product, as shown by several
criteria. NF1 was present in a large molecular mass complex in
fibroblast and schwannoma cell lines and appeared to associate with a
very large (400-500 kD) protein in both cell lines.

Daston et al. (1992) raised antibodies against peptides coded by
portions of the NF1 cDNA. These antibodies specifically recognized a
220-kD protein, called neurofibromin, in both human and rat spinal cord.
Neurofibromin was most abundant in the nervous system. Immunostaining of
tissue sections indicated that neurons, oligodendrocytes, and
nonmyelinating Schwann cells contained neurofibromin, whereas astrocytes
and myelinating Schwann cells did not.

Trovo-Marqui and Tajara (2006) stated that 4 splicing exons (9a, 10a-2,
23a, and 48a) are responsible for the production of 5 human
neurofibromin isoforms (II, 3, 4 9a and 10a-2), which exhibit
differential expression in distinct tissues. Neurofibromin II, named
GRD2 (domain II-related GAP), is the result of the insertion of exon
23a, is expressed in Schwann cells, and has a reduced capacity of acting
as GAP. Neurofibromins 3 and 4, which contain exon 48a and both exons
23a and 48a, respectively, are expressed in muscle tissue, mainly in
cardiac and skeleton muscles. Neurofibromin 9a (also called 9br) is the
result of the inclusion of exon 9a and shows limited neuronal
expression. Isoform 10a is the result of insertion of exon 10a, which
introduces a transmembrane domain. This isoform has been observed in the
majority of human tissues analyzed.

GENE STRUCTURE

Xu et al. (1990) found that 3 active genes, called OMGP (164345), EVI2B
(158381), and EVI2A (158380), lie within an intron of NF1 but in
opposite orientation.

Xu et al. (1992) found a pseudogene of the AK3L1 gene (103030) in an
intron of the NF1 gene. It appeared to be a processed pseudogene since
it lacked introns and contained a polyadenylate tract; it nevertheless
retained coding potential because the open reading frame was not
impaired by any observed base substitutions.

Heim et al. (1994) cited evidence that the NF1 gene spans approximately
350 kb of genomic DNA, encodes an mRNA of 11 to 13 kb, and contains at
least 56 exons.

Li et al. (1995) showed that the 5-prime end of the NF1 gene is embedded
in a CpG island containing a NotI restriction site and that the
remainder of the gene lies in the adjacent 35-kb NotI fragment. In their
efforts to develop a comprehensive screen for NF1 mutations, they
isolated genomic DNA clones that together contain the entire NF1 cDNA
sequence. They identified all intron-exon boundaries of the coding
region and established that it contains at least 59 exons. The 3-prime
untranslated region of the NF1 gene was found to span approximately 3.5
kb and to be continuous with the stop codon.

Trovo-Marqui and Tajara (2006) stated that the NF1 gene contains 61
exons.

MAPPING

Barker et al. (1987) demonstrated that the gene responsible for
neurofibromatosis (NF1; 162200) is located in the pericentromeric region
of chromosome 17.

Wallace et al. (1990) identified a large transcript from the candidate
NF1 region on chromosome 17q11.2 that was disrupted in 3 patients with
neurofibromatosis type I. The changes disrupted expression of the NF1
transcript in all 3 patients, consistent with the hypothesis that it
acts as a tumor suppressor.

- Pseudogenes

Legius et al. (1992) characterized an NF1-related locus on chromosome
15. The nonprocessed NF1 pseudogene (NF1P1) can produce additional
fragments in Southern blotting, pulsed field gel, and PCR experiments
with some NF1 cDNA probes or oligonucleotides. In addition, certain
regions of the NF1 gene cross-hybridize with a locus on chromosome 14.
These loci can cause confusion in the mutation analysis of patients with
NF1.

Numerous NF1 pseudogenes have been identified in the human genome. Those
in 2q21, 14q11, and 22q11 form a subset with a similar genomic
organization and a high sequence homology. By PCR and fluorescence in
situ hybridization, Luijten et al. (2001) studied the extent of the
homology of the regions surrounding these NF1 pseudogenes. They found
that a fragment of at least 640 kb is homologous between the 3 regions.
Based on previous studies and these new findings, they proposed a model
for the spreading of the NF1 pseudogene-containing regions. A fragment
of approximately 640 kb was first duplicated in chromosome region 2q21
and transposed to 14q11. Subsequently, this fragment was duplicated in
14q11 and transposed to 22q11. A part of the 640-kb fragment in 14q11,
with a length of about 430 kb, was further duplicated to a variable
extent in 14q11. In addition, Luijten et al. (2001) identified sequences
that may facilitate the duplication and transposition of the 640-kb and
430-kb fragments.

GENE FUNCTION

DeClue et al. (1992) presented evidence implicating the NF1 protein as a
tumor suppressor gene product that negatively regulates p21(ras) (see
190020) and defined a 'positive' growth role for RAS activity in NF1
malignancies.

Basu et al. (1992) presented evidence supporting the hypothesis that NF1
is a tumor-suppressor gene whose product acts upstream of the RAS
proteins. They showed that the RAS proteins in malignant tumor cell
lines from patients with NF1 were in a constitutively activated state as
measured by the ratio of the guanine nucleotides bound to them, i.e.,
the ratio of GTP (active) to GDP (inactive). Transforming mutants of
p21(ras) bind large amounts of GTP, whereas wildtype p21(ras) is almost
entirely GDP-bound.

Nakafuku et al. (1993) took advantage of the yeast RAS system to isolate
mutants in the RAS GTPase activating protein-related domain of the NF1
gene product (NF1-GRD) that can act as antioncogenes specific for
oncogenic RAS. They demonstrated that these mutant NF1-GRDs, when
expressed in mammalian cells, were able to induce morphologic reversion
of RAS-transformed NIH 3T3 cells.

Johnson et al. (1993) stated that in schwannoma cell lines from patients
with neurofibromatosis, loss of neurofibromin is associated with
impaired regulation of GTP/RAS. They analyzed other neural crest-derived
tumor cell lines and showed that some melanoma and neuroblastoma cell
lines established from tumors occurring in patients without
neurofibromatosis also contained reduced or undetectable levels of
neurofibromin, with concomitant genetic abnormalities of the NF1 locus.
In contrast to the schwannoma cell lines, however, GTP/RAS was
appropriately regulated in the melanoma and neuroblastoma lines that
were deficient in neurofibromin, even when HRAS (190020) was
overexpressed. These results demonstrated that some neural crest tumors
not associated with neurofibromatosis have acquired somatically
inactivated NF1 genes and suggested a tumor-suppressor function for
neurofibromin that is independent of RAS GTPase activation.

Silva et al. (1997) cited several studies that suggested a role of
neurofibromin in brain function. The expression of the NF1 gene is
largely restricted to neuronal tissues in the adult. This
GTPase-activating protein may act as a negative regulator of
neurotrophin (see BDNF; 113505)-mediated signaling. They also noted
immunohistochemical studies that suggested that activation of astrocytes
may be common in the brain of NF1 patients.

In a review of the molecular neurobiology of human cognition, Weeber and
Sweatt (2002) presented an overview of the RAS-ERK-CREB pathway,
including the function of NF1. The authors discussed publications that
implicated dysfunction of this signal transduction cascade in cognitive
defects, including mental retardation caused by mutation in the NF1
gene.

Vogel et al. (1995) used a targeted disruption of the NF1 gene in mice
to examine the role of neurofibromin in the acquisition of neurotrophin
dependence in embryonic neurons. They showed that both neural crest- and
placode-derived sensory neurons isolated from NF1 -/- embryos develop,
extend neurites, and survive in the absence of neurotrophins, whereas
their wildtype counterparts die rapidly unless nerve growth factor
(162030) or BDNF is added to the culture medium. Moreover, NF1 -/-
sympathetic neurons survive for extended periods and acquire mature
morphology in the presence of NGF-blocking antibodies. These results
were considered by Vogel et al. (1995) as consistent with a model
wherein neurofibromin acts as a negative regulator of
neurotrophin-mediated signaling for survival of embryonic peripheral
neurons.

For the most part the NF1 tumor suppressor acts through the interaction
of its GRD with the product of the RAS protooncogene. Skuse et al.
(1996) discovered an mRNA editing site within the NF1 mRNA. Editing at
this site changes a cytidine at nucleotide 2914 to a uridine, creating
an in-frame translation stop codon. The edited transcript, if
translated, would produce a protein truncated in the N-terminal region
of the GRD, thereby inactivating the NF1 tumor-suppressor function.
Analysis of RNA from a variety of cell lines, tumors, and peripheral
blood cells revealed that the NF1 mRNA undergoes editing, to different
extents, in every cell type studied. Three tumors analyzed as part of
their study, an astrocytoma, a neurofibroma, and a neurofibrosarcoma,
each had levels of NF1 mRNA editing substantially higher than did
peripheral blood leukocytes. To investigate the role played by editing
in NF1 tumorigenesis, Cappione et al. (1997) analyzed RNA from 19 NF1
and 4 non-NF1 tumors. (The authors referred to the editing site as
nucleotide 3916.) They observed varying levels in NF1 mRNA editing in
different tumors, with a higher range of editing in more malignant
tumors (e.g., neurofibrosarcomas) compared to benign tumors (cutaneous
neurofibromas). Plexiform neurofibromas had an intermediate range of
levels of NF1 mRNA editing. The constitutional levels of NF1 mRNA
editing varied slightly in NF1 individuals but were consistent with the
levels observed in non-NF1 individuals. In every case, there was a
greater level of NF1 mRNA editing in the tumor than in the nontumor
tissue from the same patient. These results suggested to Cappione et al.
(1997) that inappropriately high levels of NF1 mRNA editing indeed plays
a role in NF1 tumorigenesis and that editing may result in the
functional equivalent of biallelic inactivation of the NF1 tumor
suppressor.

Mukhopadhyay et al. (2002) studied C-to-U RNA editing in peripheral
nerve sheath tumor samples (PNSTs) from 34 patients with NF1. Whereas
most showed low levels of RNA editing, 8 of the 34 tumors demonstrated 3
to 12% C-to-U editing of NF1 RNA. These tumors demonstrated 2
distinguishing characteristics. First, these PNSTs expressed APOBEC1
(600130) mRNA, the catalytic deaminase of the holoenzyme that edits APOB
(107730) RNA. Second, NF1 RNA from these PNSTs contained increased
proportions of an alternatively spliced exon, 23A, downstream of the
edited base in which editing occurs preferentially. These findings,
together with results of both in vivo and in vitro experiments with
APOBEC1, strongly suggested an important mechanistic linkage between NF1
RNA splicing and C-to-U editing and provided a basis for understanding
the heterogeneity of posttranscriptional regulation of NF1 expression.

The NF1 tumor suppressor protein is thought to restrict cell
proliferation by functioning as a Ras-specific guanosine
triphosphatase-activating protein. However, The et al. (1997) found that
Drosophila homozygous for null mutations of an NF1 homolog show no
obvious signs of perturbed RAS1-mediated signaling. Loss of NF1 resulted
in a reduction in size of larvae, pupae, and adults. This size defect
was not modified by manipulating RAS1 signaling but was restored by
expression of activated adenosine 3-prime, 5-prime-monophosphate
-dependent protein kinase (PKA; see 176911). Thus, NF1 and PKA appear to
interact in a pathway that controls the overall growth of Drosophila.
Guo et al. (1997) showed, from a study of Drosophila NF1 mutants, that
NF1 is essential for the cellular response to the neuropeptide PACAP38
(pituitary adenylyl cyclase-adenosine activating polypeptide) at the
neuromuscular junction. The peptide induced a 3-prime,
5-prime-monophosphate (cAMP) pathway. This response was eliminated in
NF1 mutants. NF1 appeared to regulate the rutabaga-encoded adenylyl
cyclase rather than the RAS-RAF pathway. Moreover, the NF1 defect was
rescued by the exposure of cells to pharmacologic treatment that
increased concentrations of cAMP.

Gutmann (2001) reviewed the functions of neurofibromin and merlin, the
product of the NF2 gene (607379), in tumor suppression and cell-cell
signaling, respectively.

Trovo-Marqui and Tajara (2006) provided a detailed review of
neurofibromin and its role in neurofibromatosis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Neurofibromatosis Type I

Using pulsed field gel electrophoresis, Upadhyaya et al. (1990)
identified a 90-kb deletion in the proximal portion of 17q in 1 of 90
unrelated patients with neurofibromatosis I. Viskochil et al. (1990)
detected deletions of 190, 40, and 11 kb in the gene located at the 17q
translocation breakpoint in 3 patients with NF1.

In an NF1 patient, Wallace et al. (1991) identified an insertion of an
Alu sequence in an intron of the NF1 gene, resulting in deletion of the
downstream exon during splicing and a frameshift (613113.0001).

Cawthon et al. (1990) identified 2 different point mutations in the NF1
gene (L348P; 613113.0003 and R365X; 613113.0004) in patients with NF1.

Upadhyaya et al. (1992) identified multiple germline NF1 mutations (see,
e.g., 613113.0006-613113.0009) in patients with NF1.

Weiming et al. (1992) identified mutations in the NF1 gene in at most 3%
of NF1 subjects in an analysis that covered 17% of the coding sequence
by SSCP and a larger region by Southern blotting. The results suggested
that most NF1 mutations lie elsewhere in the coding sequence or outside
it.

Collins (1993) developed FISH techniques to detect large deletions in
the NF1 gene.

By denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), Valero et al. (1994)
screened 70 unrelated NF1 patients for mutations in exons 29 and 31. Of
the 4 mutations that were identified, 3 consisted of C-to-T transitions
resulting in nonsense mutations: 2 in exon 29 (5242C-T; 613113.0004 and
5260C-T) and 1 in exon 31 (5839C-T). The fourth mutation consisted of a
2-bp deletion in exon 31, 5843delAA, resulting in a premature stop
codon. The 5839C-T mutation had previously been reported in 3
independent studies, suggesting that this position is a mutation hotspot
within the NF1 gene. It occurs in a CpG residue.

Heim et al. (1994) stated that although mutations had been sought in
several hundred NF1 patients, by August 1994, only 70 germline mutations
had been reported in a total of 78 individuals; only the R1947X
(613113.0012) mutation had been seen in as many as 6 unrelated patients.
NF1 mutations that had been identified included 14 large (more than 25
bp) deletions, 3 large insertions, 18 small (less than 25 bp) deletions,
8 small insertions, 6 nonsense mutations, 14 missense mutations, and 7
intronic mutations. At least 56 (80%) of the 70 mutations potentially
encode a truncated protein because of premature translation termination.

Abernathy et al. (1997) stated that about half of NF1 cases represent
new mutations and fewer than 100 constitutional mutations had been
reported. They used a combined heteroduplex/SSCP approach to search for
mutations in the NF1 gene in a set of 67 unrelated NF1 patients and
identified 26 mutations and/or variants in 45 of the 59 exons tested.
Disease-causing mutations were found in 19% (13 of 67) of cases studied.
The mutations included splice mutations, insertions, deletions, and
point changes.

Maynard et al. (1997) screened exon 16 of the NF1 gene in 465 unrelated
NF1 patients. Nine novel mutations were identified: 3 nonsense, 2
single-base deletions, 1 7-bp duplication, 2 missense, and 1 recurrent
splice site mutation. No mutations had been reported previously in exon
16, which is the largest exon (441 bp) of NF1. The previous absence of
mutation identification in exon 16 suggested to the authors that codons
in this region may have a lower propensity to mutate.

Stop, or nonsense, mutations can have a number of effects. In the case
of several genes, they affect mRNA metabolism and reduce the amount of
detectable mRNA. Also, in the NF1 gene, a correlation between a high
proportion of stop mutations and unequal expression of the 2 alleles is
demonstrable. A second, less common outcome is that mRNA containing a
nonsense mutation is translated and results in a truncated protein. A
third possible outcome is an abnormally spliced mRNA induced by a
premature-termination codon (PTC) in the skipped exon. This was
demonstrated in several disease genes, including the CFTR gene (Hull et
al., 1994) and the fibrillin gene (Dietz et al., 1993). Hoffmeyer et al.
(1998) characterized several stop mutations localized within a few
basepairs in exons 7 and 37 of the NF1 gene and noticed complete
skipping of either exon in some cases. Because skipping of exons 7 and
37 does not lead to a frameshift, premature termination codons are
avoided. Hoffmeyer et al. (1998) found that some other stop mutations in
the same general region did not lead to a skip. Calculations of
minimum-free-energy structures of the respective regions suggested that
both changes in the secondary structure of mRNA and creation or
disruption of exonic sequences relevant for the splicing process may in
fact cause these different splice phenomena observed in the NF1 gene.

Mutation analysis in NF1 has been hampered by the large size of the gene
(350 kb with 60 exons), the high rate of new mutations, lack of
mutational clustering, and the presence of numerous homologous loci.
Mutation detection methods based on the direct analysis of the RNA
transcript of the gene permit the rapid screening of large multiexonic
genes. However, detection of frameshift or nonsense mutations can be
limited by instability of the mutant mRNA species due to
nonsense-mediated decay. To determine the frequency of this allelic
exclusion, Osborn and Upadhyaya (1999) analyzed total lymphocyte RNA
from 15 NF1 patients with known truncation mutations and a panel of 40
NF1 patients with unknown mutations. The level of expression of the
mutant message was greatly reduced in 2 of the 15 samples (13%), and in
3 of the 18 informative samples from the panel of 40. A coupled RT-PCR
and protein truncation test method was subsequently applied to screen
RNA from the panel of 40 unrelated NF1 patients. Aberrant polypeptide
bands were identified and characterized in 21 samples (53%); each of
these had a different mutation. The mutations were uniformly distributed
across the gene, and 14 represented novel changes, providing further
information on the germline mutational spectrum of the NF1 gene.

The mutation rate in the NF1 gene is one of the highest known in humans,
with approximately 50% of all NF1 patients presenting with novel
mutations (review by Huson and Hughes, 1994). Despite the high frequency
of this disorder in all populations, relatively few mutations had been
identified at the molecular level, with most unique to 1 family. A
limited number of mutation 'hotspots' had been identified: R1947X in
exon 31 (613113.0012), and the 4-bp region between nucleotides 6789 and
6792 in exon 37, both implicated in about 2% of NF1 patients (review by
Upadhyaya and Cooper (1998)). Messiaen et al. (1999) identified another
mutation hotspot in exon 10b. By analyzing 232 unrelated NF1 patients,
they identified 9 mutations in exon 10b, indicating that this exon is
mutated in almost 4% of NF1 patients. Two mutations, Y489C (613113.0023)
and L508P (613113.0024), were recurrent, whereas the others were unique.
The authors suggested that since 10b shows the highest mutation rate of
any of the 60 NF1 exons, it should be given priority in mutation
analysis.

Fahsold et al. (2000) performed a mutation screen of the NF1 gene in
more than 500 unrelated patients with NF1. For each patient, the whole
coding sequence and all splice sites were studied for aberrations,
either by the protein truncation test (PTT), temperature-gradient gel
electrophoresis (TGGE) of genomic PCR products, or, most often, by
direct genomic sequencing of all individual exons. Of the variants
found, they concluded that 161 different ones were novel.
Mutation-detection efficiencies of the various screening methods were
similar: 47.1% for PTT, 53.7% for TGGE, and 54.9% for direct sequencing.
Of all sequence variants found, less than 20% represented C-to-T or
G-to-A transitions within a CpG dinucleotide, and only 6 different
mutations also occurred in NF1 pseudogenes, with 5 being typical C-to-T
transitions in a CpG. Thus, neither frequent deamination of
5-methylcytosines nor interchromosomal gene conversion can account for
the high mutation rate of the NF1 gene. As opposed to the truncating
mutations, the 28 (10.1%) missense or single-amino-acid-deletion
mutations identified clustered in 2 distinct regions, the GAP-related
domain and an upstream gene segment comprising exons 11 to 17. The
latter forms a so-called cysteine/serine-rich domain with 3 cysteine
pairs suggestive of ATP binding, as well as 3 potential cAMP-dependent
protein kinase recognition sites obviously phosphorylated by PKA.
Coincidence of mutated amino acids and those conserved between human and
Drosophila strongly suggested significant functional relevance of this
region, with major roles played by exons 12a and 15 and part of exon 16.

Ars et al. (2000) applied a whole NF1 cDNA screening methodology to the
study of 80 unrelated NF1 patients and identified 44 different
mutations, 32 being novel, in 52 of the patients. Mutations were
detected in 87% of the familial cases and in 51% of the sporadic ones.
At least 15 of the 80 NF1 patients (19%) had recurrence of a previously
observed mutation. The study showed that in 50% of the patients in whom
the mutations were identified, these resulted in splicing alterations.
Most of the splicing mutations did not involve the conserved AG/GT
dinucleotides of the donor and acceptor splice sites. One frameshift, 2
nonsense, and 2 missense mutations were also responsible for alterations
in mRNA splicing. Location and type of mutation within the NF1 gene and
its putative effect at the protein level did not indicate any
relationship to any specific clinical feature of NF1. The high
proportion of aberrant spliced transcripts detected in NF1 patients
stressed the importance of studying mutations at both the genomic and
RNA level. Ars et al. (2000) raised the possibility that part of the
clinical variability in NF1 is related to mutations affecting mRNA
splicing, which is the most common molecular defect in NF1.

Messiaen et al. (2000) studied 67 unrelated NF1 patients fulfilling the
NIH diagnostic criteria (Stumpf et al., 1988; Gutmann et al., 1997), 29
familial and 38 sporadic cases, using a cascade of complementary
techniques. They performed a protein truncation test starting from
puromycin-treated EBV cell lines and, if no mutation was found,
continued with heteroduplex, FISH, Southern blot, and cytogenetic
analysis. The authors identified the germline mutation in 64 of 67
patients, and 32 of the mutations were novel. The mutation spectrum
consisted of 25 nonsense, 12 frameshift, 19 splice mutations, 6 missense
and/or small in-frame deletions, 1 deletion of the entire NF1 gene, and
a translocation t(14;17)(q32;q11.2). Their data suggested that exons
10a-10c and 37 are mutation-rich regions and that together with some
recurrent mutations they may account for almost 30% of the mutations in
classic NF1 patients. Messiaen et al. (2000) found a high frequency of
unusual splice mutations outside of the AG/GT 5-prime and 3-prime splice
sites. As some of these mutations formed stable transcripts, it remained
possible that a truncated neurofibromin was formed.

Skuse and Cappione (1997) reviewed the possible molecular basis of the
wide clinical variability in NF1 observed even among affected members of
the same family (Huson et al., 1989). The complexities of alternative
splicing and RNA editing may be involved. Skuse and Cappione (1997)
suggested that the classical 2-hit model for tumor suppressor
inactivation used to explain NF1 tumorigenesis can be expanded to
include post-transcriptional mechanisms that regulate NF1 gene
expression. Aberrations in these mechanisms may play a role in the
observed clinical variability.

Eisenbarth et al. (2000) described a systematic approach of searching
for somatic inactivation of the NF1 gene in neurofibromas. In the course
of these studies, they identified 2 novel intragenic polymorphisms: a
tetranucleotide repeat and a 21-bp duplication. Among 7 neurofibromas
from 4 different NF1 patients, they detected 3 tumor-specific point
mutations and 2 LOH events. The results suggested that small subtle
mutations occur with similar frequency to that of LOH in benign
neurofibromas and that somatic inactivation of the NF1 gene is a general
event in these tumors. Eisenbarth et al. (2000) concluded that the
spectrum of somatic mutations occurring in various tumors from
individual NF1 patients may contribute to the understanding of variable
expressivity of the NF1 phenotype.

Klose et al. (1998) identified a novel missense mutation in the NF1 gene
(R1276P; 613113.0022) in a patient with a classic multisymptomatic NF1
phenotype, including a malignant schwannoma. The mutation specifically
abolished the Ras-GTPase-activating function of neurofibromin. The
authors suggested that therapeutic approaches aimed at the reduction of
the Ras-GTP levels in neural crest-derived cells may relieve NF1
symptoms.

Kluwe et al. (1999) stated that plexiform neurofibroma can be found in
about 30% of NF1 patients, often causing severe clinical symptoms. They
examined 14 such tumors from 10 NF1 patients for loss of heterozygosity
at the NF1 gene using 4 intragenic polymorphic markers. LOH was found in
8 tumors from 5 patients, and was suspected in 1 additional tumor from
another patient. They interpreted these findings as suggesting that loss
of the second allele, and thus inactivation of both alleles of the NF1
gene, is associated with the development of plexiform neurofibromas. The
14 plexiform neurofibromas were also examined for mutation in the TP53
gene; no mutations were found.

Faravelli et al. (1999) reported a family in which 7 members developed
brain tumors which in 4 were confirmed as gliomas. Three of these
individuals had a clinical history strongly suggestive of NF1. Two
individuals with very mild features of NF1 insufficient to meet
diagnostic criteria carried a splice site mutation in intron 29 of the
NF1 gene, creating a frameshift and premature protein termination.
Faravelli et al. (1999) noted the unusually high incidence of brain
tumors in this family with the NF1 phenotype and suggested that some
cases of familial glioma may be explained by mutations in the NF1 gene.

Kluwe et al. (2003) examined 20 patients with spinal tumors from 17
families for clinical symptoms associated with NF1 and for NF1
mutations. Typical NF1 features were found in 12 patients from 11
families. Typical NF1 mutations were found in 10 of the 11 index
patients in this group, including 8 truncating mutations, 1 missense
mutation, and 1 deletion of the entire NF1 gene. Eight patients from 6
families had no or only a few additional NF1-associated symptoms besides
multiple spinal tumors, which were distributed symmetrically in all
cases and affected all 38 nerve roots in 6 patients. Only mild NF1
mutations were found in 4 of the 6 index patients in the latter group,
including 1 splicing mutation, 2 missense mutations, and 1 nonsense
mutation in exon 47 at the 3-prime end of the gene. The data indicated
that patients with spinal tumors can have various NF1 symptoms and NF1
mutations; however, patients with no or only a few additional NF1
symptoms may be a subgroup or may have a distinct form of NF1, probably
associated with milder NF1 mutations or other genetic alterations.

The underestimates of NF1 gene mutations in neurofibromatosis type I
have been attributed to the large size of the NF1 gene, the considerable
frequency of gross deletions, and the common occurrence of splicing
defects that are only detectable by cDNA analysis. A number of splicing
errors do not affect the canonical GT splice donor or AG splice
acceptor, or create novel splice sites, but may exert their effect by
means of an altered interaction between an exonic splice enhancer (ESE)
and mRNA splicing factors (Messiaen et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2001).
Colapietro et al. (2003) reported skipping of exon 7 and sequence
alterations in ESEs in a patient with severe NF1 (613113.0036).

The analysis of somatic NF1 gene mutations in neurofibromas from NF1
patients shows that each neurofibroma results from an individual second
hit mutation; thus, factors that influence somatic mutation rates may be
regarded as potential modifiers of NF1. Wiest et al. (2003) performed a
mutation screen of numerous neurofibromas from 2 NF1 patients and found
a predominance of point mutations, small deletions, and insertions as
second hit mutations in both patients. Seven novel mutations were
reported. Together with the results of studies that showed LOH as the
predominant second hit in neurofibromas of other patients, these results
suggest that in different patients different factors may influence the
somatic mutation rate and thereby the severity of the disease.

Not only can mutations in nucleotides at the ends of introns result in
abnormalities of splicing, but nonsense, missense, and even
translationally silent mutations have been shown to cause exon skipping.
The analysis of individual mutations of this kind can shed light on
basic pre-mRNA splicing mechanisms. Using cDNA-based mutation detection
analysis, Zatkova et al. (2004) identified 1 missense and 6 nonsense
mutations (e.g., 613113.0042) that lead to different extents of
exon-lacking transcripts in NF1 patients. They confirmed
mutation-associated exon skipping in a heterologous hybrid minigene
context. Because of evidence that the disruption of functional ESE
sequences is frequently the mechanism underlying mutation-associated
exon skipping, Zatkova et al. (2004) examined the wildtype and mutant
NF1 sequences with 2 available ESE prediction programs. Either or both
programs predicted the disruption of ESE motifs in 6 of the 7 analyzed
mutations. To ascertain the function of the predicted ESEs, Zatkova et
al. (2004) quantitatively measured their ability to rescue splicing of
an enhancer-dependent exon, and found that all 7 mutant ESEs had reduced
splicing enhancement activity compared to the wildtype sequences. The
results suggested that the wildtype sequences function as ESE elements,
whose disruption is responsible for the mutation-associated exon
skipping observed in NF1 patients. Furthermore, this study illustrated
the utility of ESE prediction programs for delineating candidate
sequences that may serve as ESE elements.

In a girl with aniridia (106210), microphthalmia, microcephaly, and
cafe-au-lait macules, Henderson et al. (2007) identified heterozygous
mutations in the PAX6 (R38W; 607108.0026), NF1 (R192X; 613113.0046), and
OTX2 (Y179X; 600037.0004) genes. Her mother, who carried the NF1 and
PAX6 mutations, had NF1 with typical eye defects; in addition, although
her eyes were of normal size, she had small corneas, and also had
cataracts, optic nerve hypoplasia, nystagmus, and mild iris stromal
hypoplasia with normal-sized pupils. The proband's father, who had
multiple ocular defects (MCOPS5; 610125), had previously been studied by
Ragge et al. (2005) and was heterozygous for the OTX2 nonsense mutation.
Henderson et al. (2007) noted that the proband's phenotype was
surprisingly mild, given that mutations in PAX6, OTX2, or NF1 can cause
a variety of severe developmental defects.

Sabbagh et al. (2009) examined the phenotypic correlations between
affected relatives in 750 NF1 patients from 275 multiplex families
collected through the NF-France Network. Twelve NF1-related clinical
features, including 5 quantitative traits (number of cafe-au-lait spots
of small size and of large size, and number of cutaneous, subcutaneous,
and plexiform neurofibromas) and 7 binary ones, were scored. All
clinical features studied, with the exception of neoplasms, showed
significant familial aggregation after adjusting for age and sex. For
most of them, patterns of familial correlations indicated a strong
genetic component with no apparent influence of the constitutional NF1
mutation. Heritability estimates of the 5 quantitative traits ranged
from 0.26 to 0.62. Nine tag SNPs in NF1 were genotyped in 1,132
individuals from 313 NF1 families. No significant deviations of
transmission of any of the NF1 variants to affected offspring was found
for any of the 12 clinical features examined, based on single marker or
haplotype analysis. Sabbagh et al. (2009) concluded that genetic
modifiers, unlinked to the NF1 locus, contribute to the variable
expressivity of the disease.

- Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia

Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML; 607785) is a pediatric
myelodysplastic syndrome that is associated with neurofibromatosis type
I. The NF1 gene regulates the growth of immature myeloid cells by
accelerating guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis on RAS proteins. Side et
al. (1998) undertook a study to determine if the NF1 gene is involved in
the pathogenesis of JMML in children without a clinical diagnosis of
NF1. An in vitro transcription and translation system was used to screen
JMML marrows from 20 children for NF1 mutations that resulted in a
truncated protein. SSCP analysis was used to detect RAS point mutations
in these samples. Side et al. (1998) confirmed mutations of NF1 in 3
cases of JMML, 1 of which also showed loss of the normal NF1 allele. An
NF1 mutation was detected in normal tissue from the only patient tested,
suggesting that JMML may be the presenting feature of NF1 in some
children. Activating RAS mutations were found in 4 patients; as
expected, none of these samples harbored NF1 mutations. Because 10 to
14% of children with JMML had a clinical diagnosis of NF1, these data
were consistent with the existence of NF1 mutations in approximately 30%
of JMML cases.

The risk of malignant myeloid disorders in young children with NF1 is
200 to 500 times the normal risk. Neurofibromin, the protein encoded by
the NF1 gene, negatively regulates signals transduced by Ras proteins.
Genetic and biochemical data support the hypothesis that NF1 functions
as a tumor-suppressor gene in immature myeloid cells. This hypothesis
was further supported by the demonstration by Side et al. (1997) that
both NF1 alleles were inactivated in bone marrow cells from children
with NF1 complicated by malignant myeloid disorders. Using an in vitro
transcription and translation system, they screened bone marrow samples
from 18 such children for NF1 mutations that cause a truncated protein.
Mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing of genomic DNA from the
patients, and from the affected parents in cases of familial NF1. Side
et al. (1997) found that the normal NF1 allele was absent in bone marrow
samples from 5 of 8 children who had truncating mutations of the NF1
gene.

- Neurofibromatosis-Noonan Syndrome

The overlap syndrome neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (601321) shows
features of both disorders, as was first noted by Allanson et al.
(1985). Colley et al. (1996) examined 94 sequentially identified
patients with NF1 from their genetic register and found Noonan features
in 12. Carey et al. (1997) identified a 3-bp deletion of exon 17 of the
NF1 gene in a family with NFNS (613113.0033). Stevenson et al. (2006)
provided a follow-up of this family. Baralle et al. (2003) identified
mutations in the NF1 gene in 2 patients with the overlap syndrome
(613113.0034 and 613113.0035).

Bertola et al. (2005) provided molecular evidence of the concurrence of
neurofibromatosis and Noonan syndrome in a patient with a de novo
missense mutation in the NF1 gene (613113.0043) and a mutation in the
PTPN11 gene (176876.0023) inherited from her father. The proposita was
noted to have cafe-au-lait spots at birth. Valvar and infundibular
pulmonary stenosis and aortic coarctation were diagnosed at 20 months of
age and surgically corrected at 3 years of age. As illustrated, the
patient had marked hypertelorism and proptosis as well as freckling and
cafe-au-lait spots. Lisch nodules were present. At the age of 8 years, a
pilocytic astrocytoma in the suprasellar region involving the optic
chiasm (first presenting symptomatically at 2 years of age), was
partially resected. The father, who was diagnosed with Noonan syndrome,
had downslanting palpebral fissures and prominent nasal labial folds. He
was of short stature (159 cm) and had pectus excavatum.
Electrocardiogram showed left-anterior hemiblock and complete right
bundle branch block.

In a study of 17 unrelated subjects with NFNS, De Luca et al. (2005)
found NF1 gene defects in 16. Remarkably, there was a high prevalence of
in-frame defects affecting exons 24 and 25, which encode a portion of
the GAP-related domain. No defect was observed in PTPN11 (176876), which
is the usual site of mutations causing classic Noonan syndrome. De Luca
et al. (2005) stated that including their study, 18 distinct NF1 gene
mutations had been described in 22 unrelated patients with NFNS.

- Watson Syndrome

Watson syndrome (193520) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized
by pulmonic stenosis, cafe-au-lait spots, decreased intellectual
ability, and short stature. Most affected individuals have relative
macrocephaly and Lisch nodules and about one-third of those affected
have neurofibromas. Because of clinical similarities between Watson
syndrome and neurofibromatosis, Allanson et al. (1991) performed linkage
studies in families with Watson syndrome, using probes known to flank
the NF1 gene on chromosome 17, and found tight linkage. In a patient
with Watson syndrome, Upadhyaya et al. (1992) identified an 80-kb
deletion in the NF1 gene (613113.0011). Tassabehji et al. (1993)
demonstrated an almost perfect in-frame tandem duplication of 42 bases
in exon 28 of the NF1 gene in 3 members of a family with Watson syndrome
(613113.0010).

- Spinal Neurofibromatosis

In all 5 affected members of 3-generation family with spinal
neurofibromatosis (162210) and cafe-au-lait spots, Ars et al. (1998)
identified a frameshift mutation in the NF1 gene (613113.0018).

In affected members of 2 families with spinal neurofibromas but no
cafe-au-lait macules, Kaufmann et al. (2001) identified 2 different
mutations in the NF1 gene (613113.0028 and 613113.0029, respectively).
Both NF1 mutations caused a reduction in neurofibromin of approximately
50%, with no truncated protein present in the cells. The findings
demonstrated that typical NF1 null mutations can result in a phenotype
that is distinct from classic NF1, showing only a small spectrum of the
NF1 symptoms, such as multiple spinal tumors, but not completely fitting
the current clinical criteria for spinal NF.

- Role in Cancer

Desmoplastic neurotropic melanoma (DNM) is an uncommon melanoma subtype
that shares morphologic characteristics with nerve sheath tumors. For
that reason, Gutzmer et al. (2000) analyzed 15 DNMs and 20 melanomas
without morphologic features of desmoplasia or neuroid differentiation
(i.e., common melanomas) for LOH at the NF1 locus and flanking regions.
Allelic loss was detected in 10 of 15 (67%) DNMs but in only 1 of 20
(5%) common melanomas. LOH was most frequently observed at marker IVS38,
located in intron 38 of NF1. These data suggested a role for NF1 in the
pathogenesis of DNM and supported the hypothesis that exon 37 may encode
a functional domain.

The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (2008) reported the interim
integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression, and DNA
methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas and nucleotide sequence
alterations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. The RTK/RAS/PI3K signaling
pathway was altered in 88% of glioblastomas. NF1 was found to be an
important gene in glioblastoma, with mutation or homozygous deletion of
the NF1 gene present in 18% of tumors.

ANIMAL MODEL

See 162200 for a discussion of animal models of neurofibromatosis type
I.

Ruiz-Lozano and Chien (2003) commented on how it is possible to apply
Cre-loxP technology to track the cardiac morphogenic signals mediated by
neurofibromin. A growing list of mouse lines that express Cre in
specific cardiovascular cell lineages was available.

Gene transcription may be regulated by remote enhancer or insulator
regions through chromosome looping. Using a modification of chromosome
conformation capture and fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ling et al.
(2006) found that 1 allele of the Igf2 (147470)/H19 (103280) imprinting
control region (ICR) on mouse chromosome 7 colocalized with 1 allele of
Wsb1 (610091)/Nf1 on chromosome 17. Omission of CCCTC-binding factor
(CTCF; 604167) or deletion of the maternal ICR abrogated this
association and altered Wsb1/Nf1 gene expression. Ling et al. (2006)
concluded that CTCF mediates an interchromosomal association, perhaps by
directing distant DNA segments to a common transcription factory, and
the data provided a model for long-range allele-specific associations
between gene regions on different chromosomes that suggested a framework
for DNA recombination and RNA trans-splicing.

To investigate the function of NF1 in skeletal development, Kolanczyk et
al. (2007) created mice with Nf1 knockout directed to undifferentiated
mesenchymal cells of developing limbs. Inactivation of Nf1 in limbs
resulted in bowing of the tibia, diminished growth, abnormal
vascularization of skeletal tissues, and fusion of the hip joints and
other joint abnormalities. Tibial bowing was caused by decreased
stability of the cortical bone due to a high degree of porosity,
decreased stiffness, and reduction in the mineral content, as well as
hyperosteoidosis. Accordingly, cultured osteoblasts showed increased
proliferation and decreased ability to differentiate and mineralize. The
reduced growth in Nf1-knockout mice was due to reduced proliferation and
differentiation of chondrocytes.

HISTORY

Gervasini et al. (2002) reported a direct tandem duplication of the NF1
gene identified in 17q11.2 by high-resolution FISH. FISH on stretched
chromosomes with locus-specific probes revealed the duplication of the
NF1 gene from the promoter to the 3-prime untranslated region (UTR), but
with at least the absence of exon 22. Duplication was probably present
in the human-chimpanzee-gorilla common ancestor, as demonstrated by the
finding of the duplicated NF1 gene at orthologous chromosome loci. The
authors suggested that the NF1 intrachromosomal duplication may
contribute to the high whole-gene mutation rate by gene conversion. In
contrast to the findings of Gervasini et al. (2002), however,
Kehrer-Sawatzki et al. (2002) studied a female NF1 patient with
reciprocal translocation t(17;22)(q11.2; q11.2) and determined that
there is a single NF1 gene in the 17q11.2 region. Kehrer-Sawatzki and
Messiaen (2003) analyzed another reciprocal translocation, a
t(14;17)(q32;q11.2), described in a large family with NF1, which
disrupted the NF1 gene (Messiaen et al., 2000) and again reported
findings inconsistent with a duplication of the NF1 gene at 17q11.2 as
proposed by Gervasini et al. (2002).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, ALU INS

In a patient with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1; 162200), Wallace et al.
(1991) demonstrated a de novo heterozygous Alu repetitive element
insertion into an intron of the NF1 gene, which resulted in deletion of
the downstream exon during splicing and consequently shifted the reading
frame. The patient was an isolated case in his family. The insertion,
300-500 bp, began 44 bp upstream of exon 6. This previously undescribed
mechanism of mutation indicated that Alu retrotransposition is an
ongoing process in the human germline. Alu elements had been involved in
the generation of disease mutation by recombination (e.g., in familial
hypercholesterolemia (143890) and ADA deficiency) or point mutation
(e.g., in gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina 258870; 613349.0023),
but not as a new element.

.0002
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, 5-BP DEL

In 2 patients with neurofibromatosis type I (162200), a 35-year-old man
and his daughter, Stark et al. (1991) demonstrated a 5-bp deletion
(CCACC or CACCT) and an adjacent transversion, located about 500 bp
downstream from the region that codes for a functional domain of the NF1
gene product. The mutation was demonstrable by heteroduplex analysis.
The deletion removed the proximal half of a small potential stem-loop
and interrupted the reading frame in exon 1. A severely truncated
protein with a grossly altered carboxy terminus lacking one-third of its
sequence was the predicted consequence. Stark et al. (1992) found that
both alleles were expressed in primary cultures of neurofibroma cells
and melanocytes from a cafe-au-lait macule of the proband, thus
excluding loss of heterozygosity. The authors used the 5-bp deletion for
the presymptomatic diagnosis of the 18-month-old third son of the
proband.

.0003
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, LEU348PRO

Cawthon et al. (1990) identified point mutations in a 4-kb sequence of
the transcript of the NF1 gene at a translocation breakpoint associated
with neurofibromatosis type I (162200). One mutant allele contained a
T-to-C transition that caused a leu348-to-pro (L348P) substitution, and
the second harbored a C-to-T insertion that changed an arg365 to a stop
codon (R365X; 613113.0004).

.0004
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, ARG365TER

Independently, Cawthon et al. (1990) and Estivill et al. (1991)
identified a new mutation in exon 4 of the NF1 gene; a 1087C-T
transition (numbering of Cawthon et al., 1990), resulting in an
arg365-to-ter (R365X) substitution, in patients with neurofibromatosis I
(162200). Although a different numbering system was used, this is the
same mutation as that found by Valero et al. (1994) and designated
5242C-T in exon 29. They proposed that this site, in a CpG residue, is a
hotspot for mutation in the NF1 gene.

.0005
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, LYS1423GLU

In a patient with neurofibromatosis type I (162200) and affected members
of his family, Li et al. (1992) found an AAG-to-GAG transition at codon
1423, resulting in the substitution of glutamic acid for lysine
(K1423E).

The same mutation or a mutation in the same codon leading to
substitution of glutamine for lysine through an A-to-C transversion was
also observed by Li et al. (1992) as a somatic mutation in
adenocarcinoma of the colon, myelodysplastic syndrome, and anaplastic
astrocytoma.

.0006
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, 1-BP INS, 5662C

In 2 unrelated patients with type I neurofibromatosis (162200),
Upadhyaya et al. (1992) found insertion of a cytosine within codon 1818
that changed the reading frame and resulted in 23 altered amino acids
prior to the inappropriate introduction of a stop codon at amino acid
1841. The insertion created a recognition site for enzyme MnlI. (The
authors incorrectly stated in their abstract and the legend of their
Figure 3 that there was a nucleotide insertion at 'codon 5662.' The
nucleotide insertion at residue 5662 occurs within codon 1818 in their
cDNA clone of NF1, as correctly represented in the sequence shown in
their Figure 3.)

.0007
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, 1-BP INS, FS1841TER

In a patient with neurofibromatosis type I (162200), Upadhyaya et al.
(1992) found an insertion of thymidine in codon 1823, resulting in a
shift of the reading frame, the generation of 18 amino acids different
from those of the normal protein, and a gene product that terminated
prematurely at amino acid 1840 by the creation of a stop codon at 1841.

.0008
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, LEU2143MET

In a patient with neurofibromatosis type I (162200), Upadhyaya et al.
(1992) found a heterozygous 6639C-A transversion in the NF1 gene,
resulting in a leu2143-to-met (L2143M) substitution.

.0009
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, TYR2213ASN

In a patient with neurofibromatosis type I (162200), Upadhyaya et al.
(1992) found a heterozygous 6724T-G transversion in the NF1 gene,
resulting in a tyr2213-to-asn (Y2213N) substitution.

.0010
WATSON SYNDROME
NF1, 42-BP DUP

In a family in which Watson syndrome (193520) had occurred in 3
generations, Tassabehji et al. (1993) demonstrated an almost perfect
in-frame tandem duplication of 42 bases in exon 28 of the NF1 gene.
Unlike the mutations previously described in classic NF1 which result
predominantly in null alleles, the mutation in this family would be
expected to result in a mutant neurofibromin product. The affected
mother had multiple cafe-au-lait patches, freckling in the axillary and
groin, low-set posteriorly rotated ears, a squint, and an IQ of 56. She
had no Lisch nodules or neurofibromata. A daughter, aged 3.5 years, had
multiple cafe-au-lait spots, mild pectus carinatum, hypertelorism with
epicanthic folds, a squint, low-set posteriorly rotated ears, and
moderate global developmental delay. Her twin brother had ptosis, mild
cubitus valgus, bilateral undescended testes, and mild pulmonic valvular
stenosis by echocardiography. Neither child had Lisch nodules or
neurofibromata.

.0011
WATSON SYNDROME
NF1, 80-KB DEL

Upadhyaya et al. (1992) found an 80-kb deletion at the NF1 locus in a
patient with Watson syndrome (193520).

.0012
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, ARG1947TER

A C-to-T transition changing arginine-1947 to a stop codon (R1947X) in
the NF1 gene has been described in multiple Caucasian and Japanese
families with neurofibromatosis I (162200), suggesting that this codon,
CGA, is a hotspot for mutation, presumably because it contains a CpG
dinucleotide. (Numbering of codons is based on Marchuk et al. (1991).)
The mutation was described in 3 unrelated Caucasians (Ainsworth et al.,
1993; Cawthon et al., 1990; Estivill et al., 1991); at least 2 of these
cases were sporadic. Horiuchi et al. (1994) reported the same mutation
in 2 unrelated familial cases of NF1. That these represented independent
mutations was indicated by the fact that in the 2 families the affected
individuals differed with regard to a polymorphism located within the
NF1 gene. The frequency of the arg1947-to-ter mutation may be as high as
8% in Japanese and at least 1% in Caucasians. Studying one of the
patients with the arg1947-to-ter mutation, Horiuchi et al. (1994) showed
that both the normal and the mutant allele were transcribed in a
lymphoblastoid cell line.

Heim et al. (1994) referred to the arg1947-to-ter mutation as having
been identified in 6 unrelated patients with NF1.

Lazaro et al. (1995) presented 2 further cases of the arg1947-to-ter
mutation in the NF1 gene. They stated that a total of 9 cases of the
R1947X mutation had been reported, giving a frequency of about 2%. The
mutation occurs within a CpG dinucleotide. They developed an
allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization assay for the efficient
screening of a large number of samples for this relatively common
recurrent mutation.

In a sample of 56 unrelated Korean patients with NF1, Park et al. (2000)
identified 1 with the R1947X mutation.

.0013
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, IVS18DS, G-A, +1

Purandare et al. (1995) identified a G-to-A transition at position +1 of
intron 18 of the NF1 gene in a 41-year-old Caucasian female in whom the
diagnosis of neurofibromatosis (162200) was first made at the age of 28
years when she was admitted to hospital for a grand mal seizure. A son
was also affected. The mutation resulted in skipping of exon 18 which
did not cause a shift in the reading frame but resulted in an in-frame
loss of 123 nucleotides from the mRNA and the corresponding 41 amino
acids from the protein. Purandare et al. (1995) referred to 3 previously
reported splice donor site mutations in the NF1 gene.

.0014
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, 2-BP DEL, 1541AG

The arg1947-to-ter mutation (613113.0012) is one of the few recurrent
mutations found in the NF1 gene but is not a frequent recurrence, having
been found in only 6 of 363 patients with NF1 (162200). Robinson et al.
(1996) described a recurrent 2-bp deletion in exon 10c of the NF1 gene
in 2 unrelated patients: one sporadic and another familial case. The
mutation was designated 1541delAG by the authors.

.0015
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, MET1035ARG

Wu et al. (1996) suggested that some patients diagnosed with LEOPARD
syndrome (151100) may have a mutation in the NF1 gene, whereas others
may have a mutation in a different gene. They found a de novo M1035R
missense mutation resulting from a T-to-G transversion in exon 18 of the
NF1 gene in a 32-year-old woman with a prior diagnosis of LEOPARD
syndrome, who was found to have NF1 (162200). At birth, a heart murmur
was detected resulting from subvalvular muscular aortic stenosis and
valvular aortic stenosis. The skin showed multiple dark lentigines
together with a few larger cafe-au-lait patches. The same lentigines
were present in the armpits and groin and were not raised. The patient
attended a special school for mildly mentally retarded children. At the
age of 21 years, mitral insufficiency was demonstrated resulting from a
double orifice mitral valve. The patient had macrocrania (head
circumference 58 cm), apparent hypertelorism, and a coarse face with
broad neck. Neurofibromas were not present at the age of 32, and no
Lisch nodules were seen by slit-lamp examination. The mutation was
absent in the parents, who were clinically normal.

.0016
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, ARG1391SER

Upadhyaya et al. (1997) identified 14 novel mutations in the GAP-related
domain of neurofibromin in patients with neurofibromatosis I (162200).
One of these mutations was a change at nucleotide 4173 from A to T,
changing codon 1391 from AGA (arg) to AGT (ser) (R1391S). The effect of
this R1391S missense mutation was studied by in vitro expression of a
site-directed mutant and by GAP activity assay. The mutant protein was
found to be some 300-fold less active than wildtype NF1 protein.

NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, FAMILIAL SPINAL
NF1, 1-BP INS, 8042A

In 5 affected members of a family with spinal neurofibromatosis with
cafe-au-lait macules (162210), Ars et al. (1998) identified a 1-bp
insertion (8042insA) in exon 46 of the NF1 gene. The mutation was
predicted to result in a truncated protein.

.0019
LEUKEMIA, JUVENILE MYELOMONOCYTIC
NF1, TRP1538TER

Among 20 children with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML; 607785),
Side et al. (1998) found 3 with truncating mutations in the NF1 gene.
One of the children, a 3-year-old boy, had a G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 4614, which converted codon 1538 from tryptophan to stop in
exon 27a (W1538X).

.0020
LEUKEMIA, JUVENILE MYELOMONOCYTIC
NF1, IVS34, G-A, +18

In a 19-month-old boy with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML/Mo7;
607785), Side et al. (1998) found in cloned cDNA aberrant splicing
resulting in a shift in the reading frame. Genomic DNA showed an
alteration (6579,G-A,+18) in the splice donor consensus sequence
flanking exon 34. This mutation introduced an additional 17 nucleotides
containing a novel BglI restriction enzyme site into the patient's cDNA.
Side et al. (1998) identified this restriction site in amplified cDNA
derived from the patient's EBV cell line RNA, thus confirming that this
mutation existed in the germline. Furthermore, loss of heterozygosity
was demonstrated, indicating inactivation of another NF1 allele.

.0021
LEUKEMIA, JUVENILE MYELOMONOCYTIC
NF1, IVS11, A-G, -8

In a 6-month-old boy with JMML (607785), Side et al. (1998) described a
splice mutation. Cloned cDNA showed abnormal splicing of 7 nucleotides
between exons 10c and 11. They had previously found the same mutation in
a child with familial NF1 and myelodysplasia syndrome (Side et al.
(1997)); genomic DNA sequence showed an abnormal splice acceptor
sequence upstream of exon 11 (1642,A-G,-8) creating a cryptic splice
site and consequent frameshift and premature stop codon at codon 555.

.0022
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, ARG1276PRO

In a family with a classic multisymptomatic NF1 phenotype (162200),
including a malignant schwannoma, Klose et al. (1998) found an
arg1276-to-pro (R1276P) mutation in the arginine finger of the
GAP-related domain (GRD) of the neurofibromin gene, resulting in
disruption of the most essential catalytic element for Ras-GAP activity.
Klose et al. (1998) presented data demonstrating that the R1276P
mutation, unlike previously reported missense mutations of the GRD
region, did not impair the secondary and tertiary protein structure. It
neither reduced the level of cellular neurofibromin nor influenced its
binding to Ras substantially, but it did completely disable GAP
activity. The findings provided direct evidence that failure of
neurofibromin GAP activity is a critical element in NF1 pathogenesis.
The findings suggested that therapeutic approaches aimed at the
reduction of the Ras-GTP levels in neural crest-derived cells can be
expected to relieve most of the NF1 symptoms. The proband was the first
child of unaffected, nonconsanguineous parents. She developed multiple
cafe-au-lait spots within the first year of life. Her language and motor
development were mildly retarded, and she complained of incoordination
throughout life. Around puberty, multiple cutaneous neurofibromas
developed which worsened at the time of each of her 3 pregnancies. At
the age of 31 years, routine MRI of the brain revealed multiple areas of
increased T2 signal intensity in the midbrain and a small optic glioma.
Because of recurrent paresthesias in her left leg, an MRI scan of the
spine was done 2 years later which revealed multiple schwannomas within
the vertebral foramina. The largest tumor in the lumbar region, with a
volume of approximately 8 ml, was surgically removed. Histologically,
there was no evidence of malignancy at that time. Eight months later,
the patient suffered a relapse with rapid tumor growth. At the time of
reoperation, the retroperitoneal tumor had reached a volume of 800 ml
and showed numerous necrotic and anaplastic areas with a proliferation
rate up to 60%. The patient died of widespread metastatic disease at the
age of 34 years. Her 3 male children, ages 4, 8, and 12 years, all
fulfilled the NF1 diagnostic criteria. The 2 elder sons were
macrocephalic. Language and motor development of all children was
retarded to a similar extent and on the same time scale as in their
mother. A cranial MRI scan in the 2 elder brothers showed increased T2
signal intensities similar to those in their mother.

NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, TYR489CYS

Among the 9 NF1 exon 10b mutations identified by Messiaen et al. (1999)
in 232 unrelated patients with neurofibromatosis I (162200), 2 were
recurrent: an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 1466, resulting in a
tyr489-to-cys substitution (Y489C), and a T-to-C transition at
nucleotide 1523, resulting in a leu508-to-pro substitution (L508P;
613113.0024). The Y489C mutation caused skipping of the last 62
nucleotides of exon 10b, while the L508P mutation was undetectable by
the protein truncation test.

In a patient with type I neurofibromatosis (162200), Eisenbarth et al.
(2000) identified a germline G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1260+1, the
splice donor site of intron 9 of the NF1 gene, leading to the inclusion
of 13 bp of intervening sequence into the NF1 messenger. The mutant
allele was present in all tissues tested. In a neurofibroma from this
patient, an additional C-to-T transition at nucleotide 4021
(613113.0026), a presumed 'second hit' somatic mutation, was identified.
Another neurofibroma from the same patient showed a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 4084 (613113.0027), a presumed further 'second hit' somatic
mutation. Both somatic mutations led to premature stop codons in the NF1
message.

NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, FAMILIAL SPINAL
NF1, LEU2067PRO

In a patient with spinal neurofibromatosis but without cafe-au-lait
macules (162210), Kaufmann et al. (2001) identified a leu2067-to-pro
(L2067P) mutation in exon 33 of the NF1 gene. Her clinically unaffected
61-year-old father had the same NF1 mutation in his blood cells.
Additional molecular investigations to exclude mosaicism were not
feasible and additional clinical investigations through MRI scans could
not be performed. The L2067P mutation yielded an unstable product of
approximately 50% normal neurofibromin levels, indicating functional
haploinsufficiency.

NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, FAMILIAL SPINAL, INCLUDED
NF1, IVS31, A-G, -5

In a patient with neurofibromatosis type I (162200), Fahsold et al.
(2000) identified an A-to-G transition in the NF1 gene splice acceptor
site of exon 31 (IVS31-5A-G), resulting in the addition of 4 bases to
exon 32 and a premature stop codon at amino acid 1995.

In affected members of a family with spinal neurofibromatosis without
cafe-au-lait macules (162210), Kaufmann et al. (2001) identified the
exon 31 splice site mutation. Noting that the same mutation had been
reported in a patient with classic NF1, the authors concluded that a
modifying gene may compensate for some of the effects of neurofibromin
deficiency. The splice site NF1 mutation resulted in instability of the
neurofibromin protein.

.0030
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, DEL

Upadhyaya et al. (2003) described a Portuguese family in which 3 members
had clinical features of NF1 (162200) and each had a different
underlying defect in the NF1 gene. A 12-year-old boy who had multiple
cafe-au-lait spots on his trunk and legs as well as developmental delay
had a heterozygous 1.5-Mb deletion including the entire NF1 gene. The
mutation was associated with the maternally derived chromosomal
haplotype. His 10-year-old brother, who exhibited multiple cafe-au-lait
spots and macrocephaly but whose development was within the normal
range, was heterozygous for a CGA-to-TGA transition in exon 22 of the
NF1 gene, resulting in an arg1241-to-ter mutation (613113.0031). This
mutation had previously been described; its recurrence was thought to
have been mediated by 5-methylcytosine deamination because it occurred
in a hypermutable CpG dinucleotide. The brothers' 26-year-old female
first cousin once removed (a first cousin of their father) exhibited
multiple cafe-au-lait spots, bilateral Lisch nodules, and multiple
dermal neurofibromas. She also showed severe scoliosis and several
plexiform neurofibromas in the clavicular region, but her development
was within the normal range. She was found to carry a frameshift
mutation, 5406insT (613113.0032), in exon 29 of the NF1 gene. None of
the parents had any clinical evidence of NF1 and none had a mutation in
the NF1 gene. There was also no evidence of mosaicism. Upadhyaya et al.
(2003) speculated about the mechanism of this unusual situation.

NF1, 3-BP DEL, 2970AAT

Carey et al. (1997) described a 3-bp deletion in exon 17 of the NF1 gene
in affected members of a family with neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome
(601321). The 2970delAAT mutation resulted in deletion of met991. The
clinical features of the 3 subjects were tabulated by De Luca et al.
(2005). Stevenson et al. (2006) reported a follow-up of this family.

Upadhyaya et al. (2007) reported this mutation in 47 affected
individuals from 21 unrelated families with a similar phenotype, lacking
cutaneous neurofibromas or clinically obvious plexiform neurofibromas.
One of the families had been reported by Stevenson et al. (2006);
another was reported by Castle et al. (2003) and had a diagnosis of
Watson syndrome (193520). The in-frame 3-bp deletion in exon 17 was
predicted to result in the loss of 1 of 2 adjacent methionines, either
codon 991 or codon 992, in conjunction with a silent ACA-to-ACG change
of codon 990. These 2 methionine residues are located in a highly
conserved region of neurofibromin and are expected, therefore, to have a
functional role in the protein. This was said to have been the first
study to correlate a specific small mutation of the NF1 gene with the
expression of a particular clinical phenotype.

In a patient with neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (601321), Baralle et

gene. The patient was a 6-year-old boy with more than 6 cafe-au-lait
macules. There were no other features of neurofibromatosis type I, but
his mother had a single cafe-au-lait macule and Lisch nodules, low
hairline, and short neck. He had ptosis, epicanthal folds, low posterior
hairline, and low-set ears. On echocardiogram he had pulmonic stenosis.
No neurofibromas were present.

In a patient with neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (601321), Baralle et

NF1 gene. The patient was a 20-year-old man with 7 cafe-au-lait macules,
axillary freckling, 10 neurofibromas, Lisch nodules, and scoliosis with
a structural cervical vertebral abnormality. He had downslanting
palpebral fissures, ptosis, a short, broad neck, widely spaced nipples,
and an atrial septal defect. He was of short stature and needed extra
help in mainstream school. There was no family history of similar
findings.

NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE 1
NF1, 20075G-A, 20076C-A

In a patient with severe neurofibromatosis type I (162200), Colapietro
et al. (2003) found a G-to-A transition and a C-to-A transversion at
nucleotide positions 57 and 58, respectively, of the 154-bp long NF1
exon 7, neither of which was present in the proband's parents or 50
healthy controls. RT-PCR analysis showed the expected fragment from exon
4b to 8 together with a shortened one with in-frame skipping of exon 7.
Direct sequencing of genomic DNA revealed 2 exonic heterozygous changes
at nucleotides 20075 (G-A transition) and 20076 (C-A transversion),
which belong to contiguous codons. The first substitution occurred in
the third base of the codon, changing it from CAG to CAA, both encoding
glutamine (Q315Q); the second changed the CTG codon for leucine to the
ATG codon for methionine (L316M). The use of previously established
sequence matrices for the scoring of putative ESE motifs showed that the
adjacent silent and missense mutations were located within highly
conserved overlapping stretches of 7 nucleotides with a close similarity
to the ESE-specific consensus sequences recognized by the SC35 (600813)
and SF2/ASF (600812) arginine/serine-rich (SR) proteins. The combined
occurrence of both consecutive alterations decreased the motif score for
both SR proteins below their threshold levels. As the aberrant
transcript was consistently expressed, a protein lacking 58 amino acids
was predicted. Thus, the contiguous internal exon 7 mutations appear to
have caused exon 7 skipping as a result of the missplicing caused by
abrogation of functional ESEs (see Cartegni et al. (2002) and
Fairbrother et al. (2002)). The male proband in the study of Colapietro
et al. (2003) was the third child of healthy unrelated parents. At the
age of 1 year, he underwent uronephrectomy because of right renal
dysplasia. At the age of 3 years, an optic glioma was identified and
surgically excised. The diagnosis of NF1 was made when he was 9 years
old on the basis of the presence of cafe-au-lait spots, optic glioma,
and Lisch nodules of the iris. Cerebral MRI at the age of 11 years
revealed multiple hamartomas and a right hemisphere cerebral venous
angioma. The patient showed borderline mental retardation, a height in
the 10th percentile, and an occipitofrontal head circumference in the
97th percentile. At the age of 20 years, he showed macrocephaly,
numerous cafe-au-lait spots, small cutaneous neurofibromas, a plexiform
neck neurofibroma, and axillary and inguinal freckling. Scoliosis,
winged scapulae, and bilateral genu valgum were also present.

.0037
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, 1-BP DEL, 3775T

In a patient with neurofibromatosis type I (162200), Maris et al. (2002)
identified a 1-bp deletion in the NF1 gene, 3775delT. The mutation was
not present in the patient's parents.

Mosse et al. (2004) showed that the patient originally described by
Maris et al. (2002) was also affected with neuroblastoma (256700) and
Hirschsprung disease (142623), which were caused by a 1-bp deletion in
the PHOX2B gene (676delG; 603851.0007).

.0038
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, FAMILIAL SPINAL, INCLUDED
NF1, LEU357PRO

In a patient with neurofibromatosis type I (162200), Fahsold et al.
(2000) identified a 1070T-C transition in exon 8 of the NF1 gene,
resulting in a leu357-to-pro (L357P) substitution.

In 7 affected members of a family with spinal neurofibromatosis (162210)
originally reported by Poyhonen et al. (1997), Messiaen et al. (2003)
identified the L357P mutation. The mutation was not detected in 200
normal chromosomes.

.0039
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, FAMILIAL SPINAL
NF1, IVS39DS, A-C, +3

In affected members of a family with spinal neurofibromatosis (162210)
originally reported by Pulst et al. (1991), Messiaen et al. (2003)
identified an A-to-C transversion at position +3 of the donor splice
site of exon 39 of the NF1 gene (7126+3A-C), resulting in the skipping
of exon 39.

.0040
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, 1-BP DEL, 4071C

In a patient with neurofibromatosis type I (162200) who had onset of
neurofibromatous neuropathy at the age of 42 years, Ferner et al. (2004)
identified a 1-bp deletion (4071delC) in exon 23.2 of the NF1 gene,
resulting in a premature stop codon. The deletion was predicted to
generate a truncated neurofibromin of 1,383 amino acids. Neuroimaging
studies showed the presence of multiple spinal nerve root neurofibromas.
A high-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) had been
removed from the left iliac fossa previously, with no recurrence. Benign
flexiform neurofibroma was present in the left abdominal wall.

.0041
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, LEU1243PRO

In a patient with neurofibromatosis type I (162200) who had onset of
neurofibromatous neuropathy at the age of 17 years, Ferner et al. (2004)
identified a 1243T-C transition in the NF1 gene, resulting in a
leu1243-to-pro (L1243P) substitution.

.0042
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, GLU1904TER

By cDNA-based mutation detection analysis, Zatkova et al. (2004) studied
7 nonsense or missense alleles of NF1 that caused exon skipping and
showed that disruption of exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) elements was
responsible. One of the 7 mutations was a novel nonsense mutation, a
5719G-T transversion, resulting in a glu1904-to-ter (G1904X)
substitution in exon 30. The phenotype was NF1 (162200).

.0043
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, LEU844ARG

Bertola et al. (2005) described a 14-year-old girl with
neurofibromatosis type I (162200) and Noonan syndrome (163950) who had a
de novo mutation in the NF1 gene and a mutation in the PTPN11 gene
(176876.0023) inherited from her father. The NF1 mutation was a 2531A-G
transition resulting in a leu844-to-arg substitution. The proband had
pulmonary stenosis and aortic coarctation requiring surgery and also had
a pilocytic astrocytoma in the suprasellar region involving the optic
chiasm and forming the third ventricle. She had cafe-au-lait spots and
axillary freckling typical of neurofibromatosis and marked hypertelorism
characteristic of Noonan syndrome.

.0044
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, IVS27DS, G-C, +1

In a mother and son with a mild form of NF1 (162200), Thiel et al.
(2009) identified a heterozygous mutation (4661+1G-C) in intron 27 of
the NF1 gene, resulting in the skipping of exon 27a and potentially
affecting the GAP-related domain. Both patients had cafe-au-lait spots
and mild myopia, but no neurofibromas, Lisch nodules, or optic gliomas.
The daughter of the mother, who also carried the NF1 mutation, was found
to be compound heterozygous with a mutation in the PTPN11 gene (T2I;
176876.0027). In addition to features of neurofibromatosis I, she also
had features of Noonan syndrome (163950), including hypertelorism,
low-set ears, poor growth, sternal deformity, valvular pulmonic
stenosis, and delayed development. The PTPN11 mutation was predicted to
destabilize the inactive form of PTPN11, resulting in increased basal
activity and a gain of function. The girl also developed bilateral optic
gliomas before age 2 years, which may be explained by an additive effect
of both the NF1 and PTPN11 mutations on the Ras pathway. Compound
heterozygosity for mutations in NF1 and PTPN11 were also reported by
Bertola et al. (2005) in a patient with a combination of
neurofibromatosis I and Noonan syndrome.

.0045
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS-NOONAN SYNDROME
NF1, LEU1390PHE

In affected members of a 5-generation family with
neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (601321), Nystrom et al. (2009)
identified a heterozygous 4168C-T transition in exon 24 of the NF1 gene,
resulting in a leu1390-to-phe (L1390F) substitution in the highly
conserved GAP-related domain. The family was originally reported by
Edman Ahlbom et al. (1995) as having Noonan syndrome based on dysmorphic
facial features, short stature, pulmonary stenosis, and short neck. Upon
reevaluation, Nystrom et al. (2009) found that several family members
had cafe-au-lait spots, axillary freckling, Lisch nodules, and multiple
nevi, consistent with NF1, but that all family members lacked dermal and
superficial plexiform neurofibromas. The authors concluded that the
clinical diagnosis was consistent with NFNS. Nystrom et al. (2009)
postulated that the L1390F mutation resulted in impaired GTPase
activity.

.0046
NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, TYPE I
NF1, ARG192TER

In a girl with aniridia (106210), microphthalmia, microcephaly, and
cafe-au-lait macules, Henderson et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity
for a 574C-T transition in exon 4b of the NF1 gene, resulting in an
arg192-to-ter (R192X) substitution, as well as heterozygous mutations in
the PAX6 (R38W; 607108.0026) and OTX2 (Y179X; 600037.0004) genes. Her
mother, who carried the NF1 and PAX6 mutations, had NF1 with the typical
eye defects of retinal fibroma, optic nerve glioma, and gross Lisch
nodules on the iris; in addition, although her eyes were of normal size,
she had eyes were of normal size, she had small corneas, and also had
cataracts, optic nerve hypoplasia, nystagmus, and mild iris stromal
hypoplasia with normal-sized pupils. The proband's father, who had
multiple ocular defects (MCOPS5; 610125), had previously been studied by
Ragge et al. (2005) and was heterozygous for the OTX2 nonsense mutation.
Henderson et al. (2007) noted that the proband's phenotype was
surprisingly mild, given that mutations in PAX6, OTX2, or NF1 can cause
a variety of severe developmental defects.

602306	TITLE *602306 RAL GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE DISSOCIATION STIMULATOR-LIKE 2; RGL2
;;RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB2L; RAB2L
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Ras gene family of low molecular weight GTPases plays a central role
in membrane trafficking and is regulated in part by guanine nucleotide
dissociation stimulators (GDSs) such as RALGDS (601619). Isomura et al.
(1996) identified a fetal brain cDNA, designated RAB2L, that encodes a
predicted 122-amino acid protein with 39.5% homology to the C-terminal
(Ras-binding) region of RALGDS. However, since RAB2L has no apparent
homology to the GDS-activity domain of RALGDS, its function is likely to
be different from that of GDS proteins. By Northern blot analysis, RAB2L
was expressed as a 900-bp transcript in all tissues examined; a 3.2-kb
transcript was specifically expressed in heart and skeletal muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

Herberg et al. (1998) determined that the RGL2 gene contains 18 exons
and spans about 7.3 kb.

MAPPING

Isomura et al. (1996) mapped the RAB2L gene to 6p21.3 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization. By Southern hybridization analysis, Ando et al.
(1999) mapped the RAB2L gene, which they termed HKE1.5, approximately 5
kb centromeric of the HKE2 gene (605660). They mapped the mouse gene to
the proximal end of the H2 region.

606559	TITLE *606559 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 22; TRIM22
;;STIMULATED TRANS-ACTING FACTOR, 50-KD; STAF50
DESCRIPTION TRIM proteins are composed of 3 zinc-binding domains, a RING, a B-box
type 1, and a B-box type 2, followed by a coiled-coil region. They are
involved in development and cell growth.

CLONING

By differential screening of cDNA libraries from IFNA (147660)/IFNB
(147640) (type I IFN)-treated and untreated Daudi lymphoblastoid cells,
Tissot and Mechti (1995) isolated a cDNA encoding TRIM22, which they
termed STAF50. Sequence analysis predicted that the 442-amino acid
protein is 44% and 41% identical to mouse Rpt1 and human SSA/RO52 (SSA1;
109092), respectively. It contains a ring finger, an intermediate motif,
and a CHC3H2 zinc finger in its N terminus, as well as a central
bipartite nuclear localization signal. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of a 2.8-kb transcript in type I and, to a lesser extent,
type II IFN (IFNG; 147570)-treated cells with the appropriate receptors.
In the absence of IFN treatment, TRIM22 was strongly expressed in
peripheral blood leukocytes, spleen, thymus, and ovary; it was expressed
at basal levels in other tissues. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that TRIM22
is expressed as a 54-kD protein. Functional analysis indicated that
TRIM22 downregulates transcription directed by the long terminal repeat
of HIV-1 in transfected cells, suggesting that TRIM22 may be involved in
the transduction of IFN antiviral action.

By EST database searching for B-box-containing proteins, Reymond et al.
(2001) identified 37 TRIM members, including TRIM22. Northern blot
analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of 4.5- and 3.5-kb transcripts.
Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated expression in diffuse cytoplasmic
speckles. Confocal microscopy failed to identify a subcellular
localization. Interaction mating analysis indicated that TRIM22 does not
form a homodimer.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Tissot et al. (1996) mapped the TRIM22 gene to chromosome
11p15, near the SSA1 gene. Reymond et al. (2001) mapped it to the same
location by radiation hybrid analysis.

610734	TITLE *610734 ANKYRIN REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; ANKRD2
;;ANKYRIN REPEAT PROTEIN WITH PEST MOTIF AND PROLINE-RICH REGION; ARPP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ANKRD2 belongs to the conserved muscle ankyrin repeat protein (MARP)
family. Expression of MARPs is induced in response to physiologic
stress, injury, and hypertrophy (Miller et al., 2003).

CLONING

Kemp et al. (2000) cloned mouse Ankrd2 and obtained a partial human
ANKRD2 cDNA. The full-length 328-amino acid mouse protein contains an
ATP/GTP-binding domain in its N-terminal half and an ankyrin repeat
region in its C-terminal half. It also has a nuclear localization
signal, 2 protein-destabilizing PEST sequences, and 2 phosphorylation
sites. Northern blot and PCR analyses detected expression of mouse
Ankrd2 only in tissues containing striated muscle. In situ hybridization
of mouse embryos showed that Ankrd2 expression was restricted to the
myotome of somites at day 9.5. At later developmental stages, Ankrd2
expression was stronger in outer back muscles than intercostal muscles,
and it was not expressed in heart.

Pallavicini et al. (2001) obtained full-length human ANKRD2 from a
skeletal muscle EST database. The deduced 333-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 37.2 kD. It contains at least 4 ankyrin
repeats, several potential phosphorylation sites, a PEST sequence, and a
nuclear localization signal. ANKRD2 shares 89% amino acid identity with
mouse Ankrd2 and 43% identity with human CARP (ANKRD1; 609599). Northern
blot and RT-PCR analyses showed high ANKRD2 expression in skeletal
muscle and lower expression in heart, kidney, and prostate. Western blot
analysis detected a 42-kD ANKRD2 protein mainly in skeletal muscle, but
also in heart and kidney. Immunofluorescence analysis showed punctate
nuclear ANKRD2 staining in some human and mouse myoblasts in culture,
and ANKRD2 progressively accumulated in cytoplasm as differentiation
progressed. In adult skeletal muscle tissue sections, expression was
only detected in cytoplasm. ANKRD2 expression was restricted to slow
fibers of adult skeletal muscle, but not all slow fibers expressed
ANKRD2 at the same level. Expression of ANKRD2 was weak in human
dystrophic muscle.

Using Western blot analysis, Miller et al. (2003) detected a 55-kD
ANKRD2 protein in human heart. By RT-PCR of adult and fetal heart, they
obtained additional ANKRD2 sequence including an alternative upstream
ATG start codon that adds 113 N-terminal residues (13 kD) to the ANKRD2
protein. Miller et al. (2003) suggested that this predicted 50-kD ANKRD2
isoform is specific to heart. Immunofluorescence analysis did not detect
Ankrd2 in fetal rat cardiac myocytes. However, immunoelectron microscopy
showed colocalization of Ankrd2 with titin (TTN; 188840) in the I-band
region of adult cow heart. Ankrd2 also localized to the nucleus and
perinuclear region of adult rat heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Using suppression subtractive hybridization with mouse muscle organoid
cultures, Kemp et al. (2000) found that Ankrd2 expression increased
4-fold after 7 days of stretch. Ankrd2 expression also increased during
myoblast fusion and decreased upon differentiation to the prefusion
level.

Nakamura et al. (2002) found aberrant expression of CARP and ARPP in
atrophic muscles in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; see 105400).
ARPP was expressed in a checkerboard pattern in control skeletal muscle,
but the checkerboard pattern was absent in ALS muscle. Loss of the
checkerboard pattern was not restricted to severe cases, but also
occurred in mild cases with less atrophic muscles. ARPP was highly
expressed in nuclei of ALS muscle, and ARPP was frequently coexpressed
with fast MHC (see 160730), embryonic MHC (MYH3; 160720), and slow MHC
(MYH7; 160760) in ALS muscle fibers.

Using in vitro and in vivo binding experiments, Kojic et al. (2004)
showed that ANKRD2 interacted with the Z disc protein telethonin (TCAP;
604488), as well as with the transcription factors YB1 (NSEP1; 154030),
PML (102578) isoform IV, and p53 (TP53; 191170). ANKRD2 colocalized with
PML in punctate nuclear bodies in differentiated human myotubes. In
primary human myoblasts, no nuclear bodies were detected, and both
ANKRD2 and PML localized diffusely in the cytoplasm. ANKRD2 bound p53 in
vitro and in vivo and enhanced upregulation of the CDKN1A (116899)
promoter by p53. Kojic et al. (2004) hypothesized that ANKRD2 may be
involved in sensing stress signals and linking these to muscle gene
regulation.

Using immunohistochemical microscopy, Ishiguro et al. (2005) found that
ARPP was expressed in 33 (89.2%) of 37 of rhabdomyosarcomas tested.
Western blot analysis revealed ARPP in all rhabdomyosarcomas tested.
High ARPP expression was generally associated with morphologic evidence
of skeletal muscle differentiation of tumor cells. In contrast, ARPP was
expressed in only 8 (6.3%) of 126 non-rhabdomyosarcoma tumors examined.

Mckoy et al. (2005) found significant upregulation of Ankred2 mRNA and
protein in mouse tibialis anterior muscle following 4 and 7 days of
passive stretch. In fast muscles of kyphoscoliotic (see 605739) mutant
mice, which lack the hypertrophic response to overload but have a slower
muscle phenotype than wildtype mice, Ankrd2 expression was also
significantly upregulated. In contrast, denervation of rat soleus
muscle, which produces a shift toward the fast muscle phenotype, was
associated with marked downregulation of Ankrd2. Mckoy et al. (2005)
concluded that ANKRD2 is a stretch-response gene associated with slow
muscle function, and that it is part of a mechanotransduction system
separate from the one that regulates muscle mass.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pallavicini et al. (2001) determined that the ANKRD2 gene contains 9
exons and spans about 12 kb. The 5-prime flanking region contains a TATA
box and binding motifs for the muscle-specific transcription factors
MYOD (159970) and E47 (TCF3; 147141) and for NF-kappa-B (see 164011).

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Pallavicini et al. (2001) mapped the
ANKRD2 gene to chromosome 10q23.31-q23.32.

602016	TITLE *602016 KRUPPEL-LIKE FACTOR 2; KLF2
;;LUNG KRUPPEL-LIKE ZINC FINGER TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; LKLF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Kruppel-like factors (KLFs) are zinc finger transcription factors that
play key roles in differentiation, quiescence, and homeostasis of many
cell lineages. KLF2 promotes T-cell quiescence, in part by reducing MYC
(190080) expression. KLF2 also regulates T-cell migration by controlling
expression of key regulators of T-cell trafficking, including S1P1
(S1PR1; 601974) and CD62L (SELL; 153240) (summary by Richardson et al.,
2012).

CLONING

Anderson et al. (1995) identified and characterized the gene for a novel
zinc finger transcription factor that they symbolized LKLF for 'lung
Kruppel-like factor.'

Using 5-prime and 3-prime RACE on a melted GC-rich DNA fragment similar
to mouse Lklf, Kozyrev et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding KLF2,
which they termed LKLF. Sequence analysis predicted that the 355-amino
acid LKLF protein, which is 87% identical to the mouse protein, has
N-terminal proline-rich repeats, a putative activation domain, a
potential nuclear localization signal, and a C-terminal zinc finger
domain.

By EST database searching and RACE, Wani et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA
encoding KLF2. Northern blot analysis revealed highest expression of a
1.8-kb transcript in heart, with lower levels in lung, skeletal muscle,
pancreas, and placenta; no expression was detected in brain, liver, or
kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Buckley et al. (2001) showed that expression of LKLF in a T-cell line
induced reversible quiescence resulting in marked inhibition of
proliferation, decreases in cell size and protein synthesis, and reduced
expression of activation markers. They concluded that LKLF functions, in
part, by negatively regulating a MYC (190080)-dependent pathway.

To determine the mechanism of increased sensitivity to TNF
(191160)-induced apoptosis in Traf2 (601895)-null cells, Lin et al.
(2003) used microarray analysis to identify genes abnormally expressed
in Traf2-null mouse fibroblasts. They found that expression of Lklf was
dramatically decreased in Traf2-null fibroblasts. Ectopic expression of
Lklf protected Traf2-null cells from TNF-induced apoptosis. The results
suggested that TRAF2 regulates LKLF expression through a
mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (600289) pathway.

By microarray analysis, Parmar et al. (2006) found that KLF2 was induced
in human umbilical vein endothelial cells exposed to biomechanical
stress characteristic of blood flow in regions of the human carotid
artery that are relatively resistant to atherogenesis. Flow-mediated
increase in KLF2 expression occurred via the MEK5 (MAP2K5; 602520)-ERK5
(MAPK7; 602521)-MEF2 (see MEF2A; 600660) signaling pathway.
Overexpression and silencing of KLF2 in the context of flow, combined
with analysis of gene expression, demonstrated that induction of KLF2
results in the regulation of endothelial genes controlling inflammation,
thrombosis/hemostasis, vascular tone, and blood vessel development.
Parmar et al. (2006) also found that KLF2 modulated IL1B
(147720)-mediated endothelial activation. The authors concluded that
KLF2 is a mechanically activated transcription factor that integrates
multiple endothelial functions associated with resistance to
atherogenesis.

Carlson et al. (2006) showed that KLF2 is essential for T-cell
trafficking. KLF2-deficient thymocytes show impaired expression of
several receptors required for thymocyte emigration and peripheral
trafficking, including the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor S1P1 (EDG1;
601974), CD62L (153240), and beta-7 integrin (147559). Carlson et al.
(2006) showed also that KLF2 binds and transactivates the promoter for
S1P1, a receptor that is critical for thymocyte egress and recirculation
through peripheral lymphoid organs. Carlson et al. (2006) suggested that
KLF2 serves to license mature T cells for trafficking from the thymus
and recirculation through lymphoid tissues.

Vermot et al. (2009) exploited the relationship between oscillatory flow
and heart rate to manipulate the amount of retrograde flow in the
atrioventricular canal before and during valvulogenesis in zebrafish.
They found that decreased retrograde flow leads to arrested valve
growth. Using this manipulation, the authors determined that klf2a is
normally expressed in the valve precursors in response to reversing
flows and that it is dramatically reduced by treatments that decrease
such flows. Experimentally knocking down the expression of this
shear-responsive gene with morpholine antisense oligonucleotides
resulted in dysfunctional valves. Thus, Vermot et al. (2009) concluded
that KLF2A expression appears to be necessary for normal valve
formation. This, together with its dependence on intracardiac
hemodynamic forces, makes KLF2A expression an early and reliable
indicator of proper valve development. Vermot et al. (2009) concluded
that their results demonstrated a critical role for reversing flows
during valvulogenesis and showed how relatively subtle perturbations of
normal hemodynamic patterns can lead to both major alterations in gene
expression and severe valve dysgenesis.

To investigate the process of angiogenesis, Nicoli et al. (2010) studied
aortic arch blood vessels in zebrafish, which are known to remodel in
response to blood flow. By using 2-photon imaging of live zebrafish
embryos, Nicoli et al. (2010) observed that flow is essential for
angiogenesis during aortic arch development. They found that angiogenic
sprouting of aortic arch vessels requires a flow-induced genetic pathway
in which the mechanosensitive zinc finger transcription factor klf2a
induces expression of an endothelial-specific microRNA, mir126 (611767),
to activate Vegf (192240) signaling. Nicoli et al. (2010) concluded that
their work describes a novel genetic mechanism in which a microRNA
facilitates integration of a physiologic stimulus with growth factor
signaling in endothelial cells to guide angiogenesis.

Pei et al. (2011) generated knockin mice expressing point mutations in
both receptor-interacting domains (RIDs) of Smrt (NCOR2; 600848), which
disrupted its interaction with nuclear receptors. On a pure C57BL/6J
background, these mice, which Pei et al. (2011) called Smrt(mRID) mice,
died shortly after birth from acute respiratory distress syndrome due to
abnormal terminal differentiation of type I pneumocytes. Maternal
delivery of antithyroid drugs, but not antagonists of other nuclear
receptors, rescued lethality in Smrt(mRID) pups. Mice treated with
antithyroid drugs during the time of terminal lung differentiation were
born alive, showed no evidence of respiratory distress, and survived to
adulthood. Microarray analysis revealed that Klf2 expression was
downregulated in Smrt(mRID) mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis
of MLE-12 mouse lung carcinoma cells showed that both Smrt and thyroid
hormone receptor (see 190120) bound a conserved enhancer region
downstream of the mouse Klf2 gene. Overexpression of Klf2 in MLE-12
cells upregulated expression of type I pneumocyte markers, and targeted
disruption of Klf2 in mouse lung recapitulated the phenotype of
Smrt(mRID) mice. Pei et al. (2011) concluded that regulation of KLF2
expression by SMRT is required for terminal lung development.

Thymocyte emigration after positive selection requires KLF2 expression.
Although KLF2 expression by endothelial cells requires ERK5, which is
phosphorylated in response to IL7 (146660), Weinreich et al. (2011)
found that Erk5-deficient mouse T cells underwent normal development and
had no Klf2 deficiency. They concluded that IL7 and ERK5 do not control
KLF2 or the semimature to mature single-positive thymocyte transition.

CCR5 (601373) is a cell surface molecule critical for the transmission
and spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see 609423).
Richardson et al. (2012) found that CD4-positive T cells stimulated with
phytohemagglutinin plus IL2 (147680) had increased expression of KLF2
and CCR5 and increased susceptibility to infection with HIV-1 compared
with T cells stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 (see 186740) and
anti-CD28 (186760). Enhanced expression of KLF2 did not regulate
expression of chemokine receptor ligands (e.g., CCL3; 182283) that
downregulate CCR5 expression. Knockdown of KLF2 in CD4-positive T cells
via small interfering RNA resulted in reduced CCR5 expression. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis showed that KLF2 bound to the CCR5 promoter
in resting, but not CD3/CD28-activated, CD4-positive T cells.
Transduction of KLF2 induced CCR5 in some, but not all, transformed
T-cell lines. CCR5 upregulation after KLF2 transduction restored
susceptibility to CCR5-tropic HIV-1 in the Jurkat T-cell line, which
expresses little to no KLF2. Richardson et al. (2012) concluded that
KLF2 is a host factor that modulates CCR5 expression in CD4-positive T
cells and influences susceptibility to CCR5-tropic viruses.

GENE STRUCTURE

By PCR and genomic sequence analysis, Kozyrev et al. (1999) and Wani et
al. (1999) determined that the LKLF gene contains 3 exons and spans more
than 3 kb. The 5-prime flanking region has features of a GC-rich
promoter with multiple SP1-binding sites, but it also has 2 putative
TATA boxes.

MAPPING

Kozyrev et al. (1999) mapped the KLF2 gene to chromosome
19p13.13-p13.11, close to the KLF1 gene (600599), by radiation hybrid
analysis. Wani et al. (1999) mapped the KLF2 gene to 19p13.1 by somatic
cell hybrid analysis and FISH.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mature single-positive (i.e., CD4 (186940)-positive or CD8 (see
186910)-positive) T lymphocytes enter a 'resting' state in which they
are proliferatively quiescent and relatively resistant to apoptosis. Kuo
et al. (1997) found that the expression of Lklf is developmentally
induced in mice during the maturation of single-positive quiescent T
cells and rapidly extinguished after activation of these cells.
Lklf-deficient mouse T cells produced by gene targeting had a
spontaneously activated phenotype and died in the spleen and lymph nodes
from apoptosis induced by Fas ligand (FASL; 134638). Thus, the authors
concluded that LKLF is required to program the quiescent state of
single-positive T cells and to maintain their viability in the
peripheral lymphoid organs and blood. As pointed out by Freitas and
Rocha (1997), the work suggests that the survival of naive T cells is an
active process, probably dependent on the expression of particular sets
of genes by resting T cells.

Lee et al. (2006) found that Klf2 expression during mouse embryonic
development mirrored the rise of fluid shear forces, and that
conditional deletion of Klf2 in endothelial and hematopoietic cells
resulted in lethal embryonic heart failure due to high cardiac output.
Klf2 deficiency did not result in anemia or structural vascular defects,
and it could be rescued by administration of phenylephrine, a
catecholamine that raises vessel tone. Lee et al. (2006) concluded that
KLF2 is an essential hemodynamic regulator in vivo, and that hemodynamic
regulation in response to fluid shear stress is required for
cardiovascular development and function.

Using mice with a T cell-specific deficiency in Klf2 and flow cytometric
analysis, Weinreich et al. (2009) demonstrated upregulation of Cxcr3
(300574) in Klf2-deficient T cells, as well as on wildtype bystander
cells in mixed bone marrow chimeras. Klf2-deficient T cells also
overproduced Il4 (147780), leading to upregulation of Cxcr3,
particularly on naive Cd8 thymocytes and T cells, through an Il4r
(147781)- and eomesodermin (EOMES; 604615)-dependent pathway. Weinreich
et al. (2009) concluded that KLF2 is important in regulating naive
T-cell identity, promoting T-cell recirculation through secondary
lymphoid organs, and repressing rapid cytokine production.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) is a member of the large family
of 7-transmembrane-region receptors that couple to guanine
nucleotide-binding proteins (Nystedt et al., 1995).

CLONING

Nystedt et al. (1994) cloned the mouse Par2 sequence from genomic DNA.

Nystedt et al. (1995) cloned the human PAR2 gene. The deduced 397-amino
acid protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide and 7 transmembrane
domains. Human PAR2 shares 83% amino acid identity with the 399-amino
acid mouse Par2 protein. Northern blot analysis showed that the PAR2
transcript was widely expressed in human tissues, with especially high
levels in pancreas, liver, kidney, small intestine, and colon. Moderate
expression was detected in many organs, but no expression was found in
brain or skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Nystedt et al. (1994) found that, when expressed in frog oocytes, mouse
Par2 could be activated with nanomolar concentrations of the serine
protease trypsin (276000) but not with thrombin (176930) in doses up to
100 nM.

Nystedt et al. (1995) found that, when expressed in Chinese hamster
ovary cells, human PAR2 responded to trypsin and a peptide from the
receptor sequence. Nystedt et al. (1995) found that the physiologic
activator at PAR2 was apparently not activated by ordinary ligand
binding but by proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular N terminus. The
cleavage left the new amino terminus, a tethered ligand, free to
interact with some other region of the receptor, presumably to effect
receptor activation. Nystedt et al. (1995) noted that PAR2 shares this
special mode of activation with thrombin receptor (F2R, or PAR1;
187930), for which this mechanism was first described.

PAR2 is highly expressed in colon in epithelial and neuronal elements.
Fiorucci et al. (2001) showed that PAR2 activation prevents the
development and induces healing of T helper cell type 1-mediated
experimental colitis induced by intrarectal administration of
2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in mice. Protection exerted
by PAR2 in TNBS-treated mice was reverted by injecting mice with a
truncated form of calcitonin gene-related peptide (114130) and by
ablation of sensory neurons with the neurotoxin capsaicin. Collectively,
these studies showed that PAR2 is an antiinflammatory receptor in the
colon and suggested that PAR2 ligands might be effective in the
treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (see 266600).

Ferrell et al. (2003) demonstrated that PAR2 plays a key role in chronic
joint inflammation. Using an adjuvant monoarthritis mouse model of
chronic inflammation, they found that expression of PAR2 was
substantially upregulated in inflamed tissues. Proinflammatory effects
such as prolonged joint swelling and synovial hyperemia were also
induced by PAR2 agonists. Consistent with this, PAR2-deficient mice had
no joint swelling and virtually no histologic evidence of joint damage
after the administration of the adjuvant, whereas heterozygous mice
showed an intermediate phenotype.

Dai et al. (2007) provided evidence for a mechanism in which the
proteases trypsin or tryptase (191080) activate PAR2, which in turn
sensitizes the TRPA1 (604775) channel. Trpa1 and Par2 colocalized in
primary afferent neurons within rat dorsal root ganglia, and patch-clamp
studies in HEK293 cells showed that PAR2 agonists increased TRPA1
currents. The increased sensitivity of TRPA1 was due to phospholipase C
(see 172420), which hydrolyzes plasma membrane
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and thus releases
PIP2-mediated inhibition of TRPA1. Studies in rats showed that AITC- or
cinnamaldehyde-evoked pain behavior was enhanced by Par2 activation in
vivo.

Pepducins are lipid-conjugated, membrane-tethered, cell-penetrating
peptides that act as agonists or antagonists of their cognate receptor.
Kaneider et al. (2007) found that pepducin antagonists and agonists
based on the third intracellular loop of PAR1 had substantial beneficial
or harmful effects on survival, vascular integrity, and disseminated
intravascular coagulation in mice depending on the stage of sepsis. The
effects of the pepducins were lost in Par1-deficient mice. RNA
interference-mediated suppression of PAR2 expression in human
endothelial cells showed that the protective effects of PAR1 activation
required PAR2. Transactivation of PAR2 signaling by PAR1 was enhanced by
endotoxin-dependent recruitment of PAR1-PAR2 complexes to the
endothelial cell surface. Kaneider et al. (2007) proposed that
therapeutics that selectively activate PAR1-PAR2 complexes may be
beneficial in the treatment of sepsis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nystedt et al. (1995) determined that the F2RL1 gene contains 2 exons
separated by about 14 kb. Exon 1 encodes 27 amino acids, and exon 2
encodes the remainder of the protein.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Nystedt et al. (1995) mapped the
PAR2 gene to chromosome 5q13. They noted that the thrombin receptor gene
(F2R) also maps to 5q13, raising questions concerning the evolution of
proteinase-activated receptors.

ANIMAL MODEL

Badeanlou et al. (2011) found that tissue factor (TF) (F3; 134390)
activity was upregulated in plasma and epididymal visceral adipose
tissue extracts in mice fed a high-fat diet. Mutant mice lacking the
cytoplasmic domain of Tf (Tf-delta-CT mice) or deficient in Par2
expression (Par2 -/- mice) gained less weight than wildtype mice when
fed a high-fat diet. Tf-delta-CT or Par2 -/- mice also had lower plasma
concentrations of free fatty acids and fasting insulin and glucose, with
improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, compared with
wildtype mice fed a high-fat diet. Tf-delta-CT Par2 -/- double-mutant
mice showed no additive effects. In hematopoietic cells, ablation of
Tf/Par2 signaling reduced adipose tissue macrophage inflammation, and
specific inhibition of macrophage Tf signaling ameliorated insulin
resistance. In nonhematopoietic cells, Tf/activated factor VII (F7;
613878)/Par2 signaling promoted obesity.

608877	TITLE *608877 VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 13, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, D; VPS13D
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to VPS13A (605978),
followed by RT-PCR of lymphoid cell line and brain RNA, Velayos-Baeza et
al. (2004) cloned VPS13D. They identified 2 main splice variants,
variant 1A and variant 2A, based on the presence or absence of exon 40,
respectively, and they identified 4 different 3-prime end splice
variants in the databases. Variant 1A encodes a deduced 4,388-amino acid
protein, and variant 2A encodes a deduced 4,363-amino acid protein.
VPS13D shares significant similarity with yeast Vps13 and other human
VPS13 proteins, mostly in the N and C termini. Northern blot analysis
detected VPS13D expression in all tissues tested. Variant 2A
predominated in all tissues except brain and testis, in which variant 1A
predominated.

GENE STRUCTURE

Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) determined that the VPS13D gene contains 70
exons and spans 280 kb. The translation start codon is in exon 2.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) mapped the
VPS13D gene to chromosome 1p36. They mapped the mouse Vps13d gene to
chromosome 4E1.

603164	TITLE *603164 PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS FACTOR 3; PEX3
;;PEROXIN 3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of
functional peroxisomes. The S. cerevisiae Pex3 protein is a peroxisomal
integral membrane protein required for peroxisome biogenesis and
integrity. By searching an EST database for sequences similar to the
yeast Pichia pastoris Pex3 gene, Kammerer et al. (1998) identified human
PEX3 cDNAs. Two of the cDNAs represent alternatively polyadenylated
transcripts. The deduced 373-amino acid protein shares 23% and 20%
sequence identity with P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae Pex3, respectively.
The yeast and human proteins have 2 predicted transmembrane regions in
their N-terminal halves. Using immunofluorescence, the authors localized
epitope-tagged PEX3 to the peroxisome. Overexpression of PEX3 in
mammalian cells led to proliferation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
membranes, suggesting that the early steps of peroxisome formation may
be directed via the ER. Northern blot analysis revealed that PEX3 was
expressed as a predominant 2.3-kb mRNA and a 1.6-kb mRNA in all human
tissues tested.

GENE STRUCTURE

Muntau et al. (2000) reported the genomic organization of PEX3,
sequencing of the putative promoter region, chromosomal localization,
and physical mapping. The gene contains 12 exons and spans approximately
40 kb. They assigned the gene to chromosome 6q23-q24 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Peroxisome biogenesis disorders, of which several complementation groups
have been identified, are subdivided with regard to 2 major
dysfunctions: peroxisomal matrix protein import and peroxisomal membrane
synthesis. Detectable remnant membrane structures are evident only in
the former. Shimozawa et al. (2000) stated that molecular defects had
been defined in 10 PEX genes, including 8 related to protein import and
2 related to membrane synthesis. Shimozawa et al. (2000) determined that
the human cDNA encoding peroxin-3 rescued the import of both peroxin-3
and the matrix protein in fibroblasts from a Zellweger syndrome patient
of complementation group G (614882). The patient was homozygous for a
mutation in the PEX3 gene (603164.0001).

Muntau et al. (2000) studied 2 patients assigned to complementation
group G of Zellweger syndrome who had been found to display a cellular
phenotype characterized by a lack of even residual peroxisomal membrane
structures. They identified homozygous PEX3 mutations, each leading to
C-terminal truncation of PEX3, in the 2 patients, both of whom suffered
from a severe Zellweger syndrome phenotype; see 603164.0001 and
603164.002.

Ghaedi et al. (2000) studied a patient with Zellweger syndrome of
complementation group G and demonstrated a homozygous inactivating
mutation in PEX3.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 10A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX3, 1-BP INS, 543T

In a patient with Zellweger syndrome of complementation group G (PBD10A;
614882), Muntau et al. (2000) found homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion, a
thymine in exon 7, at nucleotide 543 of the coding region. This
frameshift mutation was predicted to result in a truncation of the
C-terminal 190 amino acids of the protein. The male infant, whose
parents were consanguineous, showed marked muscular hypotonia at birth.
Dysmorphic features included hypertelorism, prominent epicanthic folds,
and a high, broad forehead with round face. Seizures developed on day 1
but were controlled with treatment. His condition deteriorated rapidly,
with death at age 4 months.

In a patient with Zellweger syndrome of complementation group G,
Shimozawa et al. (2000) identified a homozygous 11-bp insertion at
nucleotide 544 in codon val182, resulting in a change of codon (182-183)
and introduction of a termination in codon 184. This mutation is
presumably the same as that described by Muntau et al. (2000).

.0002
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 10A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX3, IVS10AS, T-G, -8

In a patient with Zellweger syndrome of complementation group G (PBD10A;
614882), Muntau et al. (2000) found a T-to-G transversion at position -8
of the 3-prime acceptor splice site of intron 10 of the PEX3 gene. This
mutation led to deletion of exon 11 and a frameshift, with a premature
termination after 3 amino acids, predicting a 56-amino acid C-terminal
truncation of the protein. The male infant was cyanotic and markedly
hypotonic at birth with absent deep tendon reflexes. He had a prominent
midface and an antimongoloid slant of the palpebral fissures, ocular
hypertelorism, small low-set ears, a prominent nose, and a high-arched
palate. The patient died at age 19 days. A brother had been similarly
affected and died at age 15 days. Ghaedi et al. (2000) demonstrated the
same mutation in a study of material from the same patient.

608072	TITLE *608072 NHL REPEAT-CONTAINING 1 GENE; NHLRC1
;;EPM2B GENE; EPM2B;;
MALIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The NHLRC1 gene encodes malin, a single subunit E3 ubiquitin (UBB;
191339) ligase, which contains a RING-HC-type zinc finger and 6 NHL
domains and is subclassified as a member of the RING-HCa family (Gentry
et al., 2005).

CLONING

Within an 840-kb region on chromosome 6p22.3 in which the putative EPM2B
locus for Lafora disease (254780) was mapped, Chan et al. (2003)
identified a single-exon gene, termed NHLRC1. The gene is predicted to
encode a 395-amino acid protein, termed malin ('mal' for seizure in
French), containing a zinc finger of the RING type and 6 NHL-repeat
protein-protein interaction domains. The presence of the RING finger
predicts an E3 ubiquitin ligase function. Northern blot analysis
indicated 2 transcripts of 1.5 kb and 2.4 kb in all tissues examined,
including multiple subregions of the brain. In cultured cells, malin was
localized at the endoplasmic reticulum and, to a lesser extent, in the
nucleus. These results were similar to those observed for laforin
(EPM2A; 607566).

MAPPING

Chan et al. (2003) identified the NHLRC1 gene between markers D6S1688
and D6S1567 on chromosome 6p22.3.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library, Gentry et al.
(2005) found that malin directly bound and interacted with laforin in
HEK293T cells in vivo. Laforin is polyubiquitinated in a malin-dependent
manner, which leads to laforin degradation. Ubiquitination depended on
malin's RING domain but not on its NHL domains, whereas the NHL domains
functioned as a substrate-interacting motif to bind laforin. Mutations
in the NHLRC1 gene abolished both laforin polyubiquitination and
degradation. Gentry et al. (2005) concluded that malin is a
single-subunit E3 ligase, that laforin is a malin substrate, and that
malin regulates laforin protein concentration. They further suggested
that mutations in the NHLRC1 gene resulting in loss of the E3 ligase
activity of malin underlie the onset of Lafora disease.

Lohi et al. (2005) showed that laforin is a GSK3B (605004) ser9
phosphatase, and therefore capable of inactivating glycogen synthase
(GYS1; 138570) through GSK3. Laforin also interacted with malin, which
has been shown to bind GYS1. The authors proposed that laforin, in
response to appearance of polyglucosans, directs 2 negative feedback
pathways: polyglucosan-laforin-GSK3-GYS1 to inhibit GYS1 activity and
polyglucosan-laforin-malin-GYS1 to remove GYS1 through proteasomal
degradation.

Cori disease (232400) is a glycogen storage disease characterized by
deficiency of the glycogen debranching enzyme AGL (610860). Cheng et al.
(2007) showed that malin interacted with mouse Agl and promoted its
ubiquitination. Transfection studies in HepG2 cells showed that Agl was
cytoplasmic, whereas malin was predominantly nuclear. However, after
depletion of glycogen stores, about 90% of transfected cells exhibited
partial nuclear Agl staining. Elevation of cAMP increased malin levels
and malin/Agl complex formation. Cheng et al. (2007) concluded that
ubiquitination of AGL may play a role in the pathophysiology of both
Lafora disease and Cori disease.

Mittal et al. (2007) showed that laforin and malin were recruited to
aggresomes upon proteasomal blockade, possibly to clear misfolded
proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Garyali et al.
(2009) tested this possibility using a variety of cytotoxic misfolded
proteins, including the expanded polyglutamine protein, as potential
substrates. Laforin and malin, together with Hsp70 (HSPA1A; 140550) as a
functional complex, suppressed the cellular toxicity of misfolded
proteins; all 3 members of the complex were required for this function.
Laforin and malin interacted with misfolded proteins and promoted their
degradation through the UPS, and they were recruited to the
polyglutamine aggregates and reduced the frequency of aggregate-positive
cells. Garyali et al. (2009) suggested that the malin-laforin complex is
a novel player in the neuronal response to misfolded proteins.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 34 probands with Lafora disease, Chan et al. (2003) identified 17
different mutations in the NHLRC1 gene in 26 families, including 8
deletions, 1 insertion, 7 missense changes, and 1 nonsense change (see,
e.g., 608072.0001). Eighteen families were homozygous and 8 were
compound heterozygous for the mutations.

Gomez-Abad et al. (2005) identified 18 mutations, including 12 novel
mutations, in the malin gene (see, e.g., 608072.0005-608072.0007) in 23
of 25 patients with Lafora disease who did not have mutations in the
laforin gene. P69A (608072.0002) was the predominant mutation,
identified in 14 chromosomes from 9 unrelated patients; haplotype
analysis suggested a founder effect for only 2 of these families.

Singh et al. (2005) identified 6 different mutations in the NHLRC1 gene
in 5 of 8 Japanese families with Lafora disease. Another Japanese family
had a mutation in the EPM2A gene, and 2 Japanese families did not have
mutations in either gene. Singh et al. (2005) concluded that mutations
in the NHLRC1 gene are a common cause of Lafora disease in Japan.

Singh et al. (2006) identified 7 different mutations, including 2 novel
mutations, in the NHLRC1 gene in affected members of 8 families with
Lafora disease. The authors stated that 39 different mutations had been
identified in the NHLRC1 gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

More than 5% of purebred miniature wirehaired dachshunds (MWHDs) in the
United Kingdom suffer an autosomal recessive progressive myoclonic
epilepsy (PME), which Lohi et al. (2005) showed to be Lafora disease
(254780). Using homozygosity and linkage analysis, they mapped the MWHD
disease locus to canine chromosome 35, which is syntenic in its entirety
to human 6p25-p21. They then cloned canine Epm2b (NHLRC1). PCR
identified a repeat region in affected dogs and revealed biallelic
expansion of the dodecamer repeat with 19 to 26 copies of the D
sequence. Comparing the amount of Epm2b mRNA in skeletal muscle from 3
affected dogs and 2 controls with quantitative RT-PCR showed that
affected mRNA levels were more than 900 times reduced. To determine
whether the extra D sequence is specific to MWHDs, Lohi et al. (2005)
sequenced Epm2b from 2 normal unrelated dogs from each of 128 breeds.
Sixty percent of their chromosomes had 3 repeats (2 Ds and 1 T) and 40%,
2 repeats (1 D and 1 T). Almost all breeds had examples of both variants
in homozygous or heterozygous state. They tested the next non-MWHD PME
case to present to the clinic, a basset hound, and found a homozygous
14-copy expansion of the repeat. Lohi et al. (2005) devised a test to
detect and counteract the mutant allele through controlled breeding.

resulting in a cys26-to-ser (C26S) substitution in one of the 7
conserved cysteine residues critical for the zinc-binding ability of the
RING finger. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect. Singh et al.

the P69A mutation in compound heterozygosity with another mutation.

Gomez-Abad et al. (2005) identified the P69A mutation in 14 chromosomes
from 9 unrelated patients with Lafora disease; haplotype analysis
suggested a founder effect for only 2 of these families. One patient who
was homozygous for the mutation presented with hepatic failure and did

presented with partial seizures with secondary generalization at ages 5
and 14, respectively. The patient with onset at age 5 years also
developed cognitive decline and was unable to attend school.

presented at age 16 years with myoclonic and absence seizures and
developed cognitive decline at age 18 years.

603816	TITLE *603816 AXIS INHIBITOR 1; AXIN1
;;AXIN;;
FUSED, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

During embryonic development and tissue homeostasis in adults, the Wnt
(see 164820)-beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806) signaling pathway modulates
cellular differentiation, proliferation, movement, and polarity. AXIN1
has both positive and negative regulatory roles in Wnt-beta-catenin
signaling. AXIN1 is a core component of a 'destruction complex' that
promotes phosphorylation and polyubiquitination of cytoplasmic
beta-catenin, resulting in beta-catenin proteasomal degradation in the
absence of Wnt signaling. Nuclear accumulation of AXIN1 can positively
influence beta-catenin-mediated transcription during Wnt signaling (Lui
et al., 2011).

CLONING

In the vertebrate embryo, the formation of the dorsal-ventral axis
depends on the activity of the Wnt signaling pathway (see 164820).
Mutations in the mouse gene 'fused' (fu) cause axis duplication in
homozygous mouse embryos. Zeng et al. (1997) renamed the fu gene 'axin'
to distinguish it from the unrelated Drosophila 'fused' gene, and cloned
mouse and human axin cDNAs. The human AXIN gene encodes a 900-amino acid
polypeptide with 87% identity to the mouse protein. Although the
sequence contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal, Zeng et al.
(1997) did not find that the protein was localized to the nucleus. The
sequence also contains a regulator of G protein signaling domain (RGS;
see 602189) and a C-terminal region with homology to a conserved
sequence near the N terminus of Drosophila and vertebrate 'dishevelled'
proteins (see 601365).

GENE FUNCTION

Zeng et al. (1997) found that injection of axin mRNA into frog embryos
inhibited dorsal axis formation, apparently by interfering with
signaling through the Wnt pathway.

The WNT signaling pathway is essential for development and
organogenesis. WNT signaling stabilizes beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806),
which accumulates in the cytoplasm, binds to T-cell factor, also known
as lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 (LEF1; 153245), and then
upregulates downstream genes. Mutations in CTNNB1 or APC (611731) occur
in human neoplasms including colon cancers and hepatocellular carcinomas
(HCC; 114550). Because hepatocellular carcinomas tend to show
accumulation of beta-catenin more often than mutations in CTNNB1, Satoh
et al. (2000) looked for mutations in AXIN1, which encodes a key factor
for WNT signaling, in 6 HCC cell lines and 100 primary HCCs. Among the 4
cell lines and 87 HCCs in which they did not detect CTNNB1 mutations,
they identified AXIN1 mutations in 3 cell lines and 6 mutations in 5 of
the primary HCCs. In cell lines containing mutations in either gene,
they observed increased DNA binding of T-cell factor associated with
beta-catenin in nuclei. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of wildtype
AXIN1 induced apoptosis in hepatocellular and colorectal cancer cells
that had accumulated beta-catenin as a consequence of either APC,
CTNNB1, or AXIN1 mutation, suggested that axin may be an effective
therapeutic molecule for suppressing growth of hepatocellular and
colorectal cancers.

To investigate whether the '2-hit' mutation of AXIN1 occurred in 5
primary HCCs in which AXIN1 mutations were found, Satoh et al. (2000)
examined loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using 2 polymorphic markers and
found LOH in 3 tumors, indicating that AXIN1 is likely to function as a
tumor suppressor. All of the AXIN1 mutations detected in hepatoma cell
lines and primary HCCs predicted truncated proteins lacking the binding
site for beta-catenin; hence, these products would lack the ability to
form complexes with beta-catenin, which would thus not be degraded
properly.

To understand how the WNT coreceptor LRP5 (603506) is involved in
transducing the canonical WNT signals, Mao et al. (2001) identified axin
as a protein that interacts with the intracellular domain of LRP5. LRP5,
when expressed in fibroblast cells, showed no effect on the canonical
WNT signaling pathway by itself, but acted synergistically with WNT. In
contrast, LRP5 mutants lacking the extracellular domain functioned as
constitutively active forms that bound axin and that induced LEF1
activation by destabilizing axin and stabilizing beta-catenin. Addition
of WNT caused the translocation of axin to the membrane and enhanced the
interaction between axin and LRP5. In addition, the LRP5 sequences
involved in interactions with axin were found to be required for LEF1
activation. The authors concluded that the binding of axin to LRP5 is an
important part of the WNT signal transduction pathway. In Rat1 and P19
cells, Chen et al. (2006) found that Macf1 (608271) interacted directly
with Axin and translocated with the Axin complex to the cell membrane
upon Wnt stimulation.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have the ability to renew themselves and
to give rise to all lineages of the blood. Reya et al. (2003) showed
that the WNT signaling pathway has an important role in this process.
Overexpression of activated beta-catenin expands the pool of HSCs in
long-term cultures by both phenotype and function. Furthermore, HSCs in
their normal microenvironment activate a LEF1/TCF reporter, which
indicates that HSCs respond to WNT signaling in vivo. To demonstrate the
physiologic significance of this pathway for HSC proliferation, Reya et
al. (2003) showed that the ectopic expression of axin or a frizzled
(603408) ligand-binding domain, inhibitors of the WNT signaling pathway,
led to inhibition of HSC growth in vitro and reduced reconstitution in
vivo. Furthermore, activation of WNT signaling in HSCs induced increased
expression of HOXB4 (142965) and NOTCH1 (190198), genes previously
implicated in self-renewal of HSCs. Reya et al. (2003) concluded that
the WNT signaling pathway is critical for normal HSC homeostasis in
vitro and in vivo, and provide insight into a potential molecular
hierarchy of regulation of HSC development.

Huang et al. (2009) used a chemical genetic screen to identify a small
molecule, XAV939, which selectively inhibits beta-catenin-mediated
transcription. XAV939 stimulates beta-catenin degradation by stabilizing
axin, the concentration-limiting component of the destruction complex.
Using a quantitative chemical proteomic approach, Huang et al. (2009)
found that XAV939 stabilizes axin by inhibiting the
poly-ADP-ribosylating enzymes tankyrase-1 (603303) and tankyrase-2
(607128). Both tankyrase isoforms interact with a highly conserved
domain of axin and stimulate its degradation through the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

Kim et al. (2013) reported that WNT signaling is governed by
phosphorylation regulation of the axin scaffolding function.
Phosphorylation by GSK3 (see 605004) kept axin activated (open) for
beta-catenin (116806) interaction and poised for engagement of LRP6
(603507). Formation of the WNT-induced LRP6-axin signaling complex
promoted axin dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase-1 (see 176875)
and inactivated (closed) axin through an intramolecular interaction.
Inactivation of axin diminished its association with beta-catenin and
LRP6, thereby inhibiting beta-catenin phosphorylation and enabling
activated LRP6 to selectively recruit active axin for inactivation
reiteratively.

Lui et al. (2011) found that the deubiquitinating protease USP34
(615295) stabilized nuclear AXIN1 in human cell lines and promoted
expression of beta-catenin target genes. USP34 immunoprecipitated with
ubiquitinated AXIN1. Lui et al. (2011) noted that tankyrase-dependent
poly-ADP-ribosylation of AXIN1 is a prerequisite for AXIN1
ubiquitination. Knockdown of USP34 or both AXIN1 and AXIN2 together in
human cell lines reduced Wnt reporter activity, suggesting that rescue
of AXIN1 from proteasomal degradation contributes to the positive effect
of AXIN1 on Wnt signaling. Lui et al. (2011) concluded that nuclear
AXIN1 has a positive regulatory role in Wnt-beta-catenin signaling that
is controlled by USP34 opposing tankyrase-dependent ubiquitination of
AXIN1.

MAPPING

By inclusion within mapped cosmids, Zeng et al. (1997) mapped the human
AXIN1 gene to 16p13.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The high rate of discordance in monozygotic twin pairs for most complex
diseases is a puzzle. The possibility has been considered that
stochastically or environmentally triggered differences in the
epigenetic status of key genes may be responsible for some MZ
discordance and, indeed, for much of the burden of complex disease. For
most complex traits, there are very few identified genes whose
methylation status can be investigated or pertinent tissue is accessible
for methylation studies on living subjects. Until such genes for common
diseases become known, therefore, it is worth investigating cases of MZ
discordance for rare diseases in which the causal gene(s) are known or
strongly suspected. Caudal duplication anomaly (607864) resembles the
spinal duplication seen in Axin(Fu) mice, which carry a mutation in the
Axin locus (Zeng et al., 1997). Highly penetrant mice displayed
bifurcating tails as a result of caudal duplication in the distal
region.

Oates et al. (2006) studied a pair of monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant
for a caudal duplication anomaly (607864), in whom Kroes et al. (2002)
had found no mutation in the AXIN1 gene. Using bisulfite sequencing,
they examined methylation at the promoter region of the AXIN1 gene in
these twins and in age-related singleton controls. Methylation of the
promoter region (608271.0002) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was
variable among individuals, including MZ pairs. In the MZ pair
discordant for the caudal duplication, this region of the affected twin
was significantly more methylated than that of the unaffected twin (P
less than 0.0001), which was significantly more methylated than those of
the controls (P = 0.02). Oates et al. (2006) confirmed that this CpG
island functions as a promoter in vitro and that its activity is
inversely proportional to the extent of methylation. This finding raised
the possibility that hypermethylation of the AXIN1 promoter is
associated with the malformation. The authors suggested that this case
may be paradigmatic for some cases of MZ discordance.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, SOMATIC
AXIN1, 33-BP DEL

In a primary hepatocellular carcinoma (114550), Satoh et al. (2000)
found a 33-bp deletion in exon 3 of the AXIN1 gene, involving 2 glycogen
synthase kinase-3-beta (GSK3B; 605004) phosphorylation sites. In
addition to this deletion they found 12 missense mutations, of which 9
occurred in codons encoding serine or threonine residues. They confirmed
that all 13 mutations found in primary HCCs occurred as somatic events.

CAUDAL DUPLICATION ANOMALY
AXIN1, PROMOTER HYPERMETHYLATION

Oates et al. (2006) examined methylation at the promoter region of the
AXIN1 gene in monozygotic twins discordant for a caudal duplication
anomaly (607864). Methylation of the promoter region in the peripheral
blood mononucleated cells was variable among individuals. The promoter
region of the AXIN1 gene was significantly more methylated in the twin
with the caudal duplication than in the unaffected twin, which was
significantly more methylated than those in controls.

602309	TITLE *602309 TUBBY-LIKE PROTEIN 2; TULP2
DESCRIPTION Mice homozygous for a splicing defect in the C terminus of the 'tubby'
gene (tub) show progressive retinal and cochlear degeneration,
maturation-onset diabetes with insulin resistance, and impaired glucose
tolerance. Database searches revealed that sequences corresponding to
the C terminus of the tub protein are highly conserved across a number
of species, including humans, mice, C. elegans, Arabidopsis, rice, and
maize, and that tub is a member of a gene family. North et al. (1997)
described TUB (601197), the human homolog of mouse tub, and 2 new family
members, TULP1 (for tubby-like protein 1; 602280) and TULP2. These 3
genes, which differ in the N-terminal half of the protein, share 60 to
90% amino acid identity across their conserved C-terminal region and
have distinct tissue expression patterns. North et al. (1997) showed
that TULP2 maps to 19q13.1 by radiation hybrid mapping.

605504	TITLE *605504 KALLIKREIN-RELATED PEPTIDASE 9; KLK9
;;KALLIKREIN 9;;
KALLIKREIN-LIKE 3; KLKL3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KLK9 belongs to the kallikrein subgroup of serine proteases, which have
diverse physiologic functions in many tissues. For background
information on kallikreins, see 147960.

CLONING

Based on homology between the human and mouse kallikrein loci, Yousef
and Diamandis (2000) defined a 300-kb human kallikrein gene region on
chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4. Within this region, they identified a new
kallikrein gene, KLK9, which they designated KLKL3. The deduced
250-amino acid KLK9 protein has a predicted molecular mass of 27.5 kD
and shares 40% amino acid sequence identity with KLK11 (604434). RT-PCR
analysis showed that KLK9 is primarily expressed in thymus, testis,
spinal cord, cerebellum, trachea, mammary gland, prostate, brain,
salivary gland, ovary, and skin. Lower levels of expression are seen in
fetal brain, stomach, lung, thyroid, placenta, liver, small intestine,
and bone marrow. No expression is seen in uterus, heart, fetal liver,
adrenal gland, colon, spleen, skeletal muscle, pancreas, or kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Yousef and Diamandis (2000) determined that the KLK9 gene is regulated
by steroid hormones in a human breast cancer cell line.

Many members of the human kallikrein gene family are differentially
expressed in various malignancies, and some are useful cancer
diagnostic/prognostic markers. Yousef et al. (2001) performed a
quantitative analysis of KLK9 expression in ovarian cancer. The results
indicated that KLK9 is under steroid hormone regulation in ovarian and
breast cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemically, the protein was
localized in the cytoplasm, but not in the nuclei, of the epithelial
cells of ovarian cancer tissues. The authors concluded that KLK9 is a
potential independent favorable prognostic marker for early-stage,
low-grade, optimally debulked ovarian cancer patients.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yousef and Diamandis (2000) determined that the KLK9 gene contains 5
coding exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Yousef and Diamandis (2000) mapped the
KLK9 gene within a 300-kb human kallikrein gene region on chromosome
19q13.3-q13.4.

606944	TITLE *606944 ERBB2 INTERACTING PROTEIN; ERBB2IP
;;DENSIN-180-LIKE PROTEIN; ERBIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a mouse kidney cDNA library with the 9
C-terminal residues of Erbb2 (164870) as bait, Borg et al. (2000) cloned
Erbb2ip, which they called Erbin. They cloned human ERBB2IP by RT-PCR of
a human B-lymphocyte cell line. The deduced 1,371-amino acid protein
contains 16 canonical LRR (leucine-rich repeat) motifs at the N
terminus, followed by an LRR-like domain, proline-rich stretches that
may represent binding sites for SH3 and WW domains, and a C-terminal PDZ
domain. Northern blot analysis revealed a 7.2-kb transcript in most
human and mouse tissues. Western blot analysis indicated a 180-kD
doublet in all tissues tested.

Favre et al. (2001) cloned ERBB2IP in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human
keratinocyte cDNA library with the N terminus of bullous pemphigoid
antigen-1 (BPAG1; 113810) as bait. They observed several splice
variants. ERBB2IP was expressed as a doublet of about 6.9 to 7.4 kb in
human keratinocytes and in a keratinocyte cell line. Semiquantitative
RT-PCR indicated numerous transcripts expressed in most tissues. Western
blot analysis showed a 200-kD in differentiated cells but not in
undifferentiated keratinocytes.

Huang et al. (2001) cloned Erbb2ip from mouse muscle, brain, and heart
cDNA libraries in a yeast 2-hybrid screen using Erbb2 as bait. Erbb2ip
was expressed as a 180-kD protein in brain, skeletal muscle, primary
muscle cultures, and muscle cell lines. Erbb2ip expression was found at
a similar level in myoblasts and myotubes, suggesting that expression is
not differentially regulated in muscle. By immunolocalization studies,
they colocalized Erbb2ip with the acetylcholine receptor at the
neuromuscular junction. Both Erbb2 and Erbb2ip were also found in
synaptosomes from adult mouse brain and copurified with postsynaptic
densities.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation, mutation analysis, and GST pull-down
experiments, Borg et al. (2000) determined that ERBB2IP interacts with
nonactivated ERBB2 and that the interaction requires the PDZ domain of
ERBB2IP. They further showed by immunolocalization studies that the 2
proteins colocalize to the basolateral surface of polarized human colon
carcinoma cells and that mutation of the PDZ domain of ERBB2IP causes
mislocalization of ERBB2 in stably transfected canine kidney cells.

By mutation analysis and in vitro binding assays, Favre et al. (2001)
determined that ERBB2IP interacts specifically with BPAG1 and integrin
beta-4 (147557).

Huang et al. (2001) found that mouse Erbb2ip associates with Psd95
(602887). Mutation analysis indicated that the interaction is dependent
upon the PDZ domain of Psd95.

GENE STRUCTURE

Favre et al. (2001) determined that the ERBB2IP gene contains at least
26 exons. Sequence comparison of ERBB2IP variants indicated that the
variants are likely caused by alternate splicing between exons 21 and
26.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ERBB2IP
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP WI-31186). Favre et al. (2001) stated that
sequence analysis places the ERBB2IP gene on the long arm of chromosome
5 between D5S427 and D5S647.

600327	TITLE *600327 SYNAPTOTAGMIN 3; SYT3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Synaptotagmin-1 (SYT1; 185605), an integral membrane protein of synaptic
vesicles, is thought to be involved in calcium-dependent exocytosis of
synaptic vesicles. Mizuta et al. (1994) cloned a novel isoform of
synaptotagmin, designated synaptotagmin-3, from a rat brain cDNA library
and studied its tissue distribution. The protein contains 588 amino
acids having 40.5, 38.3, and 64.0% identity with rat synaptotagmin-1,
rat synaptotagmin-2 (SYT2; 600104), and a third synaptotagmin isoform of
the marine ray, respectively. The region of the 2 internal repeats
homologous to the regulatory domain of protein kinase C was highly
conserved among the 3 synaptotagmins. RNA blot studies demonstrated that
synaptotagmin-3 mRNA is expressed in brain, various endocrine tissues,
and hormone-secreting clonal cells. It appeared to be involved in
Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis of secretory vesicles in endocrine cells, as
well as in neurons.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro characterization of recombinant rat Syt3, Li et al. (1995)
determined that Syt3 showed Ca(2+)-dependent binding to phospholipids,
Ca(2+)-dependent binding to syntaxins (see 186590), and
Ca(2+)-independent binding to adaptor protein-2 (see 601026).

MAPPING

Using an interspecific backcross DNA panel, Jones et al. (1995)
demonstrated that the mouse Syt3 gene is located on mouse chromosome 7;
no recombinants were observed between Syt3 and the kallikrein gene
family (Kal) in 94 meioses. To map human SYT3, they probed a Southern
blot containing genomic DNAs from a somatic cell mapping panel and found
segregation with chromosome 19. Thus, SYT3 appears to be located in the
conserved linkage group on proximal mouse chromosome 7 and human
chromosome 19q that is known to include at least 28 genes (Holdener et
al., 1993). Kwon et al. (1995) likewise mapped Syt3 to mouse chromosome
7.

612969	TITLE *612969 TIGGER TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENT-DERIVED GENE 7; TIGD7
;;SANCHO
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNA transposons, such as Tiggers, are repetitive elements that move in
the genome by excision and reintegration without an RNA intermediate.
TIGD7 belongs to a family of genes derived from Tiggers (Smit and Riggs,
1996; Dou et al., 2004). For further information on Tiggers, see TIGD1
(612972).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a fetal brain cDNA library, Dou et
al. (2004) cloned full-length TIGD7. The deduced 511-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of 55.6 kD. Like other Tigger subfamily
proteins, TIGD7 contains a DDE domain, which is involved in catalysis of
DNA cleavage and the subsequent strand transfer reaction, and CENPBN and
CENPB domains, which are involved in DNA binding. PCR analysis detected
TIGD7 in all tissues examined, with highest expression in testis and
ovary. Database analysis suggested the existence of TIGD7 splice
variants.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dou et al. (2004) determined that the TIGD7 gene contains 2 exons and
spans 11.2 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Dou et al. (2004) mapped the TIGD7 gene to
chromosome 16p13.

;;ADAPTIN, DELTA;;
GARNET, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF;;
MOCHA, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AP3D1 is a subunit of the AP3 adaptor-like complex, which is not
associated with clathrin. The AP3D1 subunit is implicated in
intracellular biogenesis and trafficking of pigment granules and
possibly platelet dense granules and neurotransmitter vesicles.

CLONING

Using homology with the alpha- (see AP2A1; 601026) and gamma-adaptins
(see AP1G1; 603533) of the AP2 and AP1 complexes, respectively, Simpson
et al. (1997) identified an EST clone of AP3D1, and they obtained the
full-length cDNA by screening a heart cDNA library. The predicted
1,112-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 125 kD and
contains an N-terminal domain, a highly hydrophilic linker or 'hinge'
domain, and a C-terminal 'ear' domain. It also has a WIIGEY consensus
sequence found in adaptins and in beta-COP (600959). AP3D1 shares only
about 15% identity with the alpha- and gamma-adaptins, and the homology
is restricted to the extreme N-terminal portion. AP3D1 shares 96%
identity with the homologous Drosophila 'garnet' protein across an
N-terminal 100-amino acid stretch. Using coimmunoprecipitation of pig
brain cytosol, Simpson et al. (1997) determined that AP3D1, beta-3 (see
AP3B1; 603401), sigma-3 (see AP3S1; 601507), and mu-3 (see AP3M1;
610366), but not gamma-adaptins, interact in AP3 complexes.
Immunofluorescence localization of AP3D1 showed colocalization with
AP3B. Endogenous AP3 complexes showed perinuclear staining with punctate
labeling extending to the cell periphery. Staining did not colocalize
with endosomal or trans-Golgi markers, nor did it colocalize with
clathrin.

Ooi et al. (1997) independently cloned AP3D1 based on sequence
similarity with the alpha- and gamma-adaptins. The predicted 1,153-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 130 kD. Ooi et al.
(1997) noted that a C-terminal extension results in the hinge/ear domain
being about 2-fold larger than those of the alpha- and gamma-adaptins.
They also identified 3 variants containing in-frame deletions. Northern
blot analysis revealed a 5-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with
highest expression in skeletal muscle, heart, pancreas, and testis. A
minor 5.5-kb transcript was detected in skeletal muscle and heart, and a
minor 4-kb transcript was detected in testis. Coimmunoprecipitations of
human fibroblasts confirmed that AP3D1 interacts with the other subunits
of the AP3 complex. Western blot analysis of AP3 complex affinity
purified from Jurkat cell cytosol showed AP3D1 to have an apparent
molecular mass of 160 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Lefrancois et al. (2004) determined that
the ear domain of the AP3 delta subunit (AP3D1) interacts with both
isoforms of the sigma-3 subunit, sigma-3A (AP3S1) and sigma-3B (AP3S2;
602416). An extended C-terminal segment of sigma-3 was necessary for the
interaction with the delta subunit. The delta-sigma-3 interaction
interfered with the binding of AP3 to ARF (see 103180), but not with its
binding to dileucine-based sorting signals. As a consequence, the delta
subunit ear inhibited the recruitment of AP3 to membranes both in vitro
and in vivo and impaired the sorting of lysosomal membrane proteins.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Consortium mapped the AP3D1 gene to
chromosome 19 (TMAP stSG50005). Kantheti et al. (1998) mapped the mouse
Ap3d1 gene to chromosome 10 in a region showing homology of synteny to
human chromosome 19p13.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Simpson et al. (1997) and Ooi et al. (1997) showed that the garnet
mutation in Drosophila, which causes reduced pigmentation of the eyes
and other tissues, results from a mutation in the fly Ap3d1 gene.

The 'mocha' mouse mutant, a model for Hermansky-Pudlack syndrome
(203300), shows coat and eye color dilution, reduced levels of renal
lysosomal enzymes in urine, and prolonged bleeding due to storage pool
deficiency in the dense granules of platelets. Mocha mice have balance
problems due to otolith defects and eventually become deaf. They are
also hyperactive and have a unique hypersynchronized 6- to 7-Hz
electrocortigram. By Southern blot analysis of restriction digests of
mocha mouse DNA, Kantheti et al. (1998) determined that mocha is a null
allele of the Ap3d1 gene. They observed a lack of AP3 in mocha tissues
and reduced levels of the zinc transporter Znt3 (SLC30A3; 602878) in
brain, resulting in a lack of zinc-associated Timm historeactivity in
hippocampal mossy fibers.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The TCF3 gene, also called E2A, encodes 2 basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
transcription factors, E12 and E47, through alternative splicing. E12
and E47 are involved in regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression
(Bain et al., 1994).

CLONING

Expression of immunoglobulin genes depends on various sequence motifs in
their enhancer and promoter regions. One class of such sequences is the
E box, which is found in both heavy and light chain enhancers. The
kappa-E2 site has been shown to be important for light chain gene
transcription. To isolate cDNAs encoding kappa-E2-binding proteins,
Murre et al. (1989) screened a cDNA expression library derived from a
human B-cell lymphoma cell line (BJAB) with an oligonucleotide
containing a trimerized kappa-E2 site. They identified a partial cDNA
encoding a protein that they designated E12. Using the E12 cDNA to
rescreen the BJAB cDNA library, Murre et al. (1989) isolated a partial
cDNA encoding a protein that they designated E47. Sequence analysis
suggested that E12 and E47 are derived from a single gene, called E2A or
TCF3, via alternative splicing. E12 contains a leucine zipper; the
corresponding region of E47 was not cloned. Both the E12 and E47
proteins contain a region that is homologous to regions in MYOD
(159970), members of the MYC family (e.g., 190080), the Drosophila
'daughterless' gene product, and products of the Drosophila
'achaete-scute' and 'twist' gene families. The homologous regions have
the potential to form 2 amphipathic helices separated by an intervening
loop, and the hydrophobic residues present in the helices are highly
conserved.

Henthorn et al. (1990) independently cloned E2A and designated it ITF1.

GENE FUNCTION

Murre et al. (1989) showed that both E12 and E47 bound specifically to
the kappa-E2 sequence. They demonstrated that E47 bound kappa-E2 as a
dimer in vitro. Murre et al. (1989) demonstrated that the
helix-loop-helix motif of E12/E47 plays a crucial role in both
dimerization and DNA binding.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (101400) is an autosomal dominant
craniosynostosis syndrome characterized by premature fusion of coronal
sutures and limb abnormalities of variable severity. Mutations in TWIST
(601622), a class B basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor,
have been shown to be responsible for this phenotype. El Ghouzzi et al.
(2000) used a yeast 2-hybrid system to study interaction between TWIST
and E12, a potential partner in heterodimerization. Missense mutations
involving the helical domains of TWIST led to a complete loss of
heterodimerization with the E12 protein, and dramatically altered the
ability of the TWIST protein to localize in the nucleus of transfected
COS cells. The authors hypothesized that the E12-TWIST heterodimer may
serve as a negative regulator of transcription in osteoblastic cells.

TAL1 (187040) is necessary for establishment of the hematopoietic system
and can either activate or repress transcription depending upon other
factors recruited to TAL1-nucleated complexes. Goardon et al. (2006)
found that ETO2 (CBFA2T3; 603870) copurified with TAL1 complexes in
human and mouse erythroleukemia cells. Protein pull-down assays revealed
that ETO2 interacted with E2A and HEB (TCF12; 600480) within the TAL1
complex, but not with TAL1 itself. ETO2 also interacted with E2A in
erythroid cells independent of the TAL1 complex. Reporter gene assays
revealed that ETO2 repressed the transcriptional activity of the
complex. The ETO2 content in TAL1 complexes was high during the
proliferative phase in erythroid cells. In contrast, ETO2 was
downregulated upon terminal differentiation, concomitant with appearance
of histone modifications associated with gene activation and expression
of glycophorin A (GPA; 111300) and band 4.2 (EPB42; 177070), which are
markers of erythrocyte maturation. Knockdown of ETO2 via small
interfering RNA induced growth arrest and differentiation in human and
mouse erythroid progenitors. Goardon et al. (2006) concluded that ETO2
is required for expansion of erythroid progenitors, but that it is
dispensable for terminal maturation. They proposed that the
stoichiometry of ETO2 with the TAL1 complex controls the transition from
erythroid progenitor expansion to terminal differentiation.

The vitamin D receptor-interacting repressor (VDIR), a basic
helix-loop-helix transcription activator, regulates the transcription of
CYP27B1 (609506) by binding to the negative vitamin D response element
(nVDRE) in the CYP27B1 promoter (Kim et al., 2007).

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization and Southern analysis of rodent-human somatic
cell hybrids, Mellentin et al. (1989) demonstrated that the E2A gene
maps to 19p13.3-p13.2, a site associated with nonrandom translocations
in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL; 613065). By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Trask et al. (1993) assigned the TCF3 gene to 19p13.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a genomewide analysis of leukemic cells from 242 pediatric ALL
patients using high resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
arrays and genomic DNA sequencing, Mullighan et al. (2007) identified
mutations in genes encoding principal regulators of B-lymphocyte
development and differentiation in 40% of B-progenitor ALL cases.
Deletions were detected in TCF3, IKZF1 (603023), IKZF3 (606221), EBF1
(164343), and LEF1 (153245). The PAX5 (167414) gene was the most
frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7% of cases.

CYTOGENETICS

Evidence presented by Mellentin et al. (1989) suggested that most, and
perhaps all, t(1;19)(q23;p13) chromosomal translocations, a frequent
cytogenetic change in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, contain
rearrangements of the E2A gene.

Hunger (1996) reviewed clinical features and the molecular pathogenesis
of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) caused by chromosomal
translocations involving the E2A gene. E2A proteins play an
indispensable role in B-cell lymphopoiesis. The pathogenesis of a subset
of B-precursor ALLs involves replacement of the bHLH regions of the E2A
protein with heterologous DNA-binding domains.

- E2A/PBX1 Fusion Gene

Nourse et al. (1990) detected altered E2A transcripts, which lacked
sequences encoding the helix-loop-helix DNA-binding motif, in several
t(1;19)-carrying cell lines. They cloned fusion cDNAs that crossed the
t(1;19) breakpoint. These cDNAs encode an 85-kD protein consisting of
the N-terminal two-thirds of E2A fused to a chromosome 1-derived
protein. The fusion protein has the features of a chimeric transcription
factor in which the DNA-binding domain of E2A is replaced by the
putative DNA-binding domain of a homeoprotein from chromosome 1, which
Nourse et al. (1990) named PRL (PBX1; 176310) for 'pre-B cell leukemia.'
By PCR of 3 t(1;19)-carrying cell lines, the authors detected identical
E2A-PRL mRNA junctions, indicating that the fusion transcripts and
predicted chimeric protein are a consistent feature of this
translocation.

Kamps et al. (1990) found that a cell line with a t(1;19)(q23;p13.3)
translocation contains 2 novel chimeric mRNAs, both with the same
5-prime E2A sequences but with different lengths of 3-prime sequence
from a gene located on chromosome 1, which they called PRL (PBX1). The
chimeric RNAs encode proteins that lack 171 amino acids of E2A,
including its DNA-binding and dimerization motifs, but have instead a
homeobox-related sequence from PRL. Kamps et al. (1990) suggested that
the production of a chimeric E2A-PRL protein may contribute to the acute
lymphoblastic phenotype by directly altering the expression of genes
normally responsive to the PRL homeoprotein.

Wiemels et al. (2002) sequenced the genomic fusion between the E2A and
PBX1 genes in 22 pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemias and 2 cell lines.
The prenatal origin of the leukemia was assessed in 15 pediatric
patients by screening for the clonotypic E2A-PBX1 translocation in
neonatal blood spots, or Guthrie cards, obtained from the children at
birth. Two patients were weakly positive for the fusion at birth, in
contrast to previously studied childhood leukemia fusions, t(12;21),
t(8;21), and t(4;11), which are predominantly prenatal. The presence of
extensive N-nucleotides at the point of fusion in the E2A-PBX1
translocation as well as specific characteristics of the IGH
(147100)/TCR (see 186880) rearrangements provided additional evidence
for a postnatal, pre-B cell origin. Sixteen of 24 breakpoints on the
3.2-kb E2A intron 14 were located within 5 bp, providing evidence for a
site-specific recombination mechanism. Breakpoints on the 232-kb PBX1
intron 1 were more dispersed, but were highly clustered proximal to exon
2. Thus, the translocation breakpoints displayed evidence of unique
temporal, ontologic, and mechanistic formation in contrast to the
previously analyzed pediatric leukemia translocation breakpoints,
emphasizing the need to differentiate cytogenetic and molecular
subgroups for studies of leukemia causality.

- E2A/HLF Fusion Gene

Inaba et al. (1992) showed that a t(17;19) chromosomal translocation in
early B-lineage acute leukemia resulted in chimeric transcripts that
contained sequences from the E2A basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
transcription factor gene on chromosome 19, fused to sequences from a
gene on chromosome 17 that encodes a hepatic leukemia factor (HLF;
142385). The chimeric protein consisted of the amino-terminal
transactivation domain of E2A linked to the carboxyl-terminal basic
region-leucine zipper domain of HLF.

Kurosawa et al. (1999) found that E2A/HLF upregulated expression of
SRPUL (SRPX2; 300642) and annexin-8 (ANXA8; 602396) in pro-B cells.
Transfection of a human myeloid leukemia cell line with E2A/HLF induced
expression of ANXA8, but not SRPUL. E2A/HLF protected mouse pro-B cells
from apoptosis caused by IL3 (147740) deprivation, but neither ANXA8 or
SRPUL could block apoptosis, suggesting that they are not involved in
malignant transformation.

Using representational difference analysis, Dang et al. (2001) found
that the E2A/HLF fusion protein upregulated expression of several
groucho-related genes (GRGs), including Grg2 and Grg6 (TLE6; 612399),
following expression in a mouse pro-B cell line. A mutant E2A/HLF
protein lacking DNA-binding activity also stimulated expression of GRGs.
Among the transcription factors that interact with GRG proteins, only
Runx1 (151385) was appreciably downregulated by E2A/HLF.

- E2A/TFPT Fusion Gene

Brambillasca et al. (1999) identified 4 cases of acute lymphoblastic
leukemia displaying E2A/FB1 (TFPT; 609519) chimeric transcripts that
appeared to originate from a cryptic rearrangement of chromosome 19. The
5-prime portion of E2A was interrupted at different positions within
exons 13 or 14 and fused to FB1. The fusion was in-frame in 1 case, and
the remaining cases showed out-of-frame fusions leading to stop codons
in FB1 or to truncation of the predicted chimeric product. Brambillasca
et al. (1999) found no evidence of reciprocal chimeric transcripts.

ANIMAL MODEL

Heterodimers between tissue-specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
proteins and the products of the E2A gene play major roles in
determining tissue-specific cell fate. The E2A gene gives rise to 2
proteins, E12 and E47, by differential splicing of E12- and E47-specific
bHLH-encoding exons. Although they were initially identified in B cells
as immunoglobulin enhancer-binding proteins, they were subsequently
found to be present in most cell types. To understand the broad role of
E2A in development, Zhuang et al. (1994) generated E2A mutant mice
following homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Homozygous
mutant mice developed to full term without apparent abnormalities, but
then displayed a high rate of postnatal death. The surviving mice showed
retarded postnatal growth. Detailed examination of hematopoiesis
revealed that the homozygous mutant mice contained no B cells, whereas
other lineages, including the T cell, granulocyte, macrophage, and
erythroid lineages, were intact. The block to B-cell differentiation
occurred before the immunoglobulin gene D(H)-J(H) rearrangement.
Surprisingly, heterozygous embryos contained, on average, about half as
many B cells as did wildtype embryos, suggesting the existence of a
counting mechanism that translates levels of E2A into numbers of B
cells.

Sun (1994) generated transgenic mice in which the Id1 gene (600349) was
constitutively overexpressed in the B-cell lineage. The product of this
gene is an inhibitor of the DNA-binding activity of bHLH proteins such
as the E2A gene product. The phenotype of these transgenic mice depicted
severe defects in early B-cell development, suggesting that the bHLH
proteins play pivotal roles in B-cell development and that the
downregulation of Id1 gene expression is necessary for B cells to
differentiate.

Bain et al. (1994) likewise generated E2A-null mice by gene targeting
and found that they failed to generate mature B cells. The arrest of
B-cell development occurred at an early stage since no immunoglobulin DJ
rearrangements could be detected. The finding suggested a crucial role
for E2A products in the regulation of early B-cell differentiation.

To investigate the biologic role of the E2A-HLF fusion gene, Honda et
al. (1999) generated transgenic mice expressing E2A-HLF in the lymphoid
lineage. The transgenic mice exhibited abnormal development in the
thymus and spleen and were susceptible to infection. The thymus
contained small numbers of thymocytes and showed a high population of
thymocytes undergoing apoptosis. The spleen exhibited a marked reduction
in lymphocytes, and studies showed that B-cell maturation was blocked at
a very early developmental stage. Several transgenic mice developed
acute leukemia, classified as T-ALL. Smith et al. (1999) likewise
studied the function of the fusion gene in transgenic mice.
Approximately 60% of E2A-HLF mice developed lymphoid malignancies with a
mean latency of 10 months. Tumors were monoclonal, consistent with the
requirement for secondary genetic events. Smith et al. (1999) concluded
that the fusion gene disrupts the differentiation of T-lymphoid
precursors in vivo, leading to profound postnatal thymic depletion and
rendering B- and T-cell progenitors susceptible to malignant
transformation.

NOMENCLATURE

The TCF3 gene, also known as E2A, should not be confused with the the
TCF7L1 gene (604652), which was initially designated TCF3. TCF3 encodes
the bHLH transcription factors E12 and E47, whereas TCF7L1 encodes a
TCF/LEF transcription factor involved in Wnt (see 164820) signaling.

606299	TITLE *606299 PROTOCADHERIN-GAMMA, SUBFAMILY B, MEMBER 1; PCDHGB1
;;PCDH-GAMMA-B1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules, and
protocadherins constitute a subfamily of nonclassic cadherins. PCDHGB1
is 1 of 22 tandemly arranged genes within the PCDHG gene cluster
(604968) on chromosome 5q31. The 22 PCDHG genes function as 'variable'
exons that are individually spliced to a downstream constant region to
form distinct PCDHG transcripts. The variable PCDHG exons encode the
extracellular and transmembrane domains of the protocadherin protein,
and the common region encodes the intracellular domain (Wu et al.,
2001). For further information on the PCDHG genes, see 604968.

CLONING

By PCR of a brain cDNA library, Wu and Maniatis (1999) cloned
full-length PCDHGB1.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2001) mapped the PCDHGB1 gene
to chromosome 5q31, between the PCDHGA3 gene (606290) and the PCDHGA4
gene (606291). They localized the mouse PCDHG genes to chromosome 18c.

605358	TITLE *605358 GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR IIA, 1-LIKE; GTF2A1L
;;TFIIA-ALPHA/BETA-LIKE FACTOR; ALF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Synthesis of eukaryotic mRNA requires the assembly of RNA polymerase II
and various general transcription factors, such as the TFIIA subunits
alpha/beta (GTF2A1; 600520) and gamma (GTF2A2; 600519), which interact
with the TATA-binding protein (TBP; 600075) and a separate 4-helix
bundle positioned just upstream of the TBP-TATA complex. ALF is a germ
cell-specific transcription factor with a domain structure similar to
GTF2A1 (Upadhyaya et al., 1999).

CLONING

By searching databases for genes similar to GTF2A1, followed by 5-prime
RACE of a testis cDNA library, Upadhyaya et al. (1999) cloned ALF. The
478-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 53 kD. In
comparison with the organization of GTF2A1, ALF has conserved regions I
and IV and acidic region III, but it has a distinct region II. Northern
and dot blot analyses showed strong testis-restricted expression of a
1.8-kb ALF transcript, which differed from the widespread expression of
GTF2A1 and GTF2A2. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed a 69-kD ALF protein.
Upadhyaya et al. (1999) suggested that the difference between the
calculated and observed molecular masses may be due to the effect of
charged region III.

Han et al. (2001) cloned mouse Alf. The mouse protein shares highest
similarity with human ALF in regions I and IV. Northern blot analysis of
mouse and rat tissues detected expression only in testis. Expression was
first detected in mouse testis at postnatal day 14. Sedimentation
analysis and in situ hybridization showed that Alf was expressed in
pachytene spermatocytes and haploid spermatids.

In the process of cloning ALF, Upadhyaya et al. (1999) also cloned a
longer transcript, SALF, containing most of the ALF sequence at its
3-prime end. Han et al. (2001) determined that SALF is a chimeric
transcript that contains exons 1 through 3 of STON1 (605357) spliced to
exons 2 through 9 of ALF. See 605357 for further information on SALF.

GENE FUNCTION

Using gel shift analysis, Upadhyaya et al. (1999) demonstrated that,
like GTF2A1, ALF, in conjunction with GTF2A2 and TBP, bound DNA.
Functional analysis showed that ALF, together with GTF2A2, allowed mRNA
transcription.

Upadhyaya et al. (2002) found that mammalian ALF was able to stabilize
the binding of TBP to DNA, but it could not stabilize several TBP
mutants. Phosphorylation of ALF with casein kinase II (see CSNK2A1;
115440) resulted in partial restoration of complex formation using
mutant TBPs. Studies of ALF-TBP complexes formed on the adenovirus major
late promoter revealed protection of the TATA box and upstream sequences
from -38 to -20 on the top strand and -40 to -22 on the bottom strand.
The presence of ALF or TFIIA did not significantly alter the ability of
TBP to bind TATA elements from several testis specific genes. Analysis
of the distinct, nonhomologous internal regions II of ALF and GTF2A1
using circular dichroism spectroscopy suggested that these domains are
unordered. Upadhyaya et al. (2002) concluded that the role of ALF in the
assembly and stabilization of initiation complexes in germ cells is
likely to be similar or identical to the role of TFIIA in somatic cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Han et al. (2001) determined that the ALF gene contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

By PCR of a panel of human-rodent chromosomal hybrids and genomic
sequence analysis, Han et al. (2001) mapped the GTF2A1L gene to
chromosome 2p.

602228	TITLE *602228 TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 7-LIKE 2; TCF7L2
;;T-CELL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 4, FORMERLY; TCF4, FORMERLY
TCF7L2/VTI1A FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The TCL7L2 gene product is a high mobility group (HMG) box-containing
transcription factor implicated in blood glucose homeostasis. The study
of Yi et al. (2005) suggested that TCL7L2 acts through regulation of
proglucagon (138030) through repression of the proglucagon gene in
enteroendocrine cells via the Wnt signaling pathway.

CLONING

The HMG box is a DNA-binding domain. TCF7 (189908), also called TCF1,
and LEF1 (153245), also called TCF1-alpha, are human lymphoid
transcription factors that contain a virtually identical HMG box. By PCR
of human genomic DNA using degenerate oligonucleotides based on the HMG
boxes of TCF7 and LEF1, Castrop et al. (1992) identified the TCF7L1
(604652) and TCF7L2 genes, which they called TCF3 and TCF4,
respectively. TCF7L1 and TCF7L2 were not expressed in cells of the
lymphoid lineage. The deduced amino acid sequences of the HMG boxes of
TCF7L1, TCF7L2, and TCF7 show striking homology. The authors suggested
the existence of a subfamily of TCF7-like HMG box-containing
transcription factors.

Prokunina-Olsson et al. (2009) identified several TCF7L2 splice
variants. The full-length protein contains an N-terminal beta-catenin
(CTNNB1; 116806)-binding domain, followed by a Groucho (TLE1;
600189)-interacting domain, an evolutionarily conserved C-terminal CRARF
(MASP1; 600521)-type domain, and a C-terminal CTBP (602618)-binding
site. Using primers based on common exons for PCR analysis,
Prokunina-Olsson et al. (2009) detected highest overall TCF7L2
expression in pancreas, followed by colon, brain, small intestine,
monocytes, and lung. Lower expression was detected in all other tissues
examined, and little to no expression was detected in activated or
resting T and B cells. Exon-specific PCR showed tissue-specific
expression of several splice variants. Transcripts lacking exons 1 and 2
were predicted to encode proteins lacking the beta-catenin-binding
domain. Transcripts containing exon 13b, which encode proteins lacking
the CTBP-binding site, were detected only in pancreatic islets,
pancreas, and colon. Prokunina-Olsson et al. (2009) concluded that
alternative splicing results in TCF7L2 proteins that either repress or
activate the WNT signaling pathway.

GENE FUNCTION

Inactivation of the APC gene (611731) in colorectal cancers (114500)
allows beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806) to accumulate and complex with the
TCF4 transcription factor, thereby activating the expression of
TCF4-regulated genes (Korinek et al., 1997; Morin et al., 1997). That
gene activation by the beta-catenin/TCF4 complex is a critical event in
cancer development is indicated by the fact that a subset of colorectal
cancers that lack somatic mutations in APC show somatic mutations in the
beta-catenin gene. These mutations are presumed to render beta-catenin
insensitive to regulation by APC and GSK3B (605004). Consequently,
beta-catenin accumulates and activates TCF4-regulated genes (Morin et
al., 1997).

Rodova et al. (2002) presented evidence for beta-catenin-induced
expression of PKD1 (601313). They analyzed the promoter region of PKD1
and identified numerous transactivating factors, including 4 TCF-binding
elements (TBEs). Beta-catenin induced a reporter construct containing
TBE1 6-fold when cotransfected into HEK293T cells, which express TCF4.
Dominant-negative TCF4 or deletion of the TBE1 sequence inhibited the
induction. Gel shift assays confirmed that TCF4 and beta-catenin could
complex with the TBE1 site, and HeLa cells stably transfected with
beta-catenin responded with elevated levels of endogenous PKD1 mRNA.
Rodova et al. (2002) concluded that the PKD1 gene is a target of the
beta-catenin/TCF pathway.

Van de Wetering et al. (2002) showed that disruption of
beta-catenin/TCF4 activity in colorectal cancer cells induced a rapid G1
arrest and blocked a genetic program that was physiologically active in
the proliferative compartment of colon crypts. Coincidently, an
intestinal differentiation program was induced. The TCF4 target gene MYC
(190080) played a central role in this switch by direct repression of
the CDKN1A (116899) promoter. Following disruption of beta-catenin/TCF4
activity, the decreased expression of MYC released CDKN1A transcription,
which in turn mediated G1 arrest and differentiation. The authors
concluded that the beta-catenin/TCF4 complex constitutes the master
switch that controls proliferation versus differentiation in healthy and
malignant intestinal epithelial cells.

Batlle et al. (2002) showed that beta-catenin and TCF inversely control
the expression of the EphB2 (600997)/EphB3 (601839) receptors and their
ligand, ephrin B1 (EFNB1; 300035), in colorectal cancer and along the
crypt-villus axis. Disruption of EphB2 and EphB3 genes revealed that
their gene products restrict cell intermingling and allocate cell
populations within the intestinal epithelium. In EphB2/EphB3-null mice,
the proliferative and differentiated populations intermingled. In adult
EphB3 -/- mice, Paneth cells did not follow their downward migratory
path, but scattered along crypt and villus. The authors concluded that,
in the intestinal epithelium, beta-catenin and TCF couple proliferation
and differentiation to the sorting of cell populations through the
EphB/ephrin B system.

Nateri et al. (2005) showed that phosphorylated c-JUN (165160) interacts
with the HMG-box transcription factor TCF4 to form a ternary complex
containing c-JUN, TCF4, and beta-catenin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
assays revealed JNK (see 601158)-dependent c-JUN-TCF4 interaction on the
c-JUN promoter, and c-JUN and TCF4 cooperatively activated the c-JUN
promoter in reporter assays in a beta-catenin-dependent manner. In the
Apc(Min) mouse model of intestinal cancer (see 611731), genetic
abrogation of c-JUN N-terminal phosphorylation or gut-specific
conditional c-JUN inactivation reduced tumor number and size and
prolonged life span. Therefore, Nateri et al. (2005) concluded that the
phosphorylation-dependent interaction between c-JUN and TCF4 regulates
intestinal tumorigenesis by integrating JNK and APC/beta-catenin, 2
distinct pathways activating WNT (see 164820) signaling.

Glucuronic acid epimerase (GLCE; 612134) is responsible for
epimerization of D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) to L-iduronic acid (IdoA) of
the cell surface polysaccharide heparan sulfate (HS), endowing the
nascent HS polysaccharide chain with the ability to bind growth factors
and cytokines. Using stepwise deletion and site-directed mutagenesis,
Ghiselli and Agrawal (2005) identified 2 cis-acting binding elements for
the beta-catenin-TCF4 complex in the enhancer region of the GLCE
promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift analyses
confirmed binding of beta-catenin-TCF4 to these sequences of GLCE. GLCE
expression in human colon carcinoma cell lines correlated with the
degree of activation of the beta-catenin-TCF4 transactivation complex.
Furthermore, ectopic expression of beta-catenin-TCF4 increased the GLCE
transcript level and enhanced the rate of GlcA epimerization in HS.
Ghiselli and Agrawal (2005) concluded that the beta-catenin-TCF4
transactivation pathway plays a major role in modulating GLCE
expression, thus contributing to regulation of HS biosynthesis and its
structural organization.

Moore et al. (2008) showed that epitope-tagged mammalian Mtgr1 (CBFA2T2;
603672), Mtg8 (RUNX1T1; 133435), and Mtg16 (CBFA2T3; 603870) interacted
with human TCF4 in cotransfected COS-7 cells. Beta-catenin disrupted
interaction of Mtg proteins with TCF4. Additional studies demonstrated
that MTG proteins act downstream of beta-catenin in the Wnt signaling
pathway.

Shu et al. (2009) found decreased TCF7L2 protein levels in pancreatic
sections from 7 patients with T2DM (NIDDM; 125853) compared with 7
healthy controls. Expression of the receptors for glucagon-like
peptide-1 (GLP1R; 138032) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic
polypeptide (GIPR; 137241) was decreased in human T2DM islets as well as
in isolated human islets treated with siRNA to TCF7L2 (siTCF7L2).
Insulin secretion stimulated by glucose, GLP1, and GIP (137240), but not
KCl or cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), was impaired in
siTCF7L2-treated isolated human islets. Loss of TCF7L2 resulted in
decreased GLP1 and GIP-stimulated AKT (AKT1; 164730) phosphorylation,
and AKT-mediated Foxo-1 (FOXO1A; 136533) phosphorylation and nuclear
exclusion. Shu et al. (2009) suggested that beta-cell function and
survival may be regulated through an interplay between TCF7L2 and
GLP1R/GIPR expression and signaling in T2DM.

Nakano et al. (2010) identified a conserved region within intron 1 of
the mouse and human TMEPAI genes (606564). Using mouse and human
constructs and cell lines, they found that a reporter construct driven
by the conserved region of mouse intron 1 could be activated via
TGF-beta (190180) or Wnt (see 606359) signaling individually or by these
pathways synergizing to elevate activity. Wnt signaling included an
interaction between beta-catenin (116806) and Tcf7l2, with Tcf7l2 bound
to a specific Tcf7l2-binding site. The TGF-beta signaling components
included Smad3 (603109), Smad4 (600993), and Tcf7l2, with the 2 Smad
proteins bound directly to 3 Smad-binding elements adjacent to the
Tcf7l2-binding site.

Sotelo et al. (2010) identified a highly conserved enhancer element,
designated enhancer E, over 340 kb telomeric to the MYC gene. Reporter
gene assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that
beta-catenin/TCF4 interacted with enhancer E and activated expression of
a MYC reporter. Chromosome conformation capture assays suggested
formation of long-range DNA looping between the enhancer and the MYC
promoter.

GENE STRUCTURE

Duval et al. (2000) determined the genomic structure of TCF4. They
identified 17 exons, of which 5 were alternative. Either experimentally
or in silico by a BLAST approach in EST databases, they observed 4
alternative splice sites. The alternative use of 3 consecutive exons
located in the 3-prime part of the TCF4 gene changed the reading frames
used in the last exon, leading to the synthesis of a number of TCF4
isoforms with short, medium, or long C-terminal ends.

Prokunina-Olsson et al. (2009) identified 18 exons in the TCF7L2 gene,
including 6 alternative exons (3a, 4a, 12, 13, 13a, and 13b). They also
identified several short in-frame insertions in exons 4a, 6, and 8. Six
possible transcription start sites are located upstream of exon 2, and
translational start codons are present in exons 1 and 3.

CYTOGENETICS

- VTI1A/TCF7L2 Fusion Gene

Bass et al. (2011) reported whole-genome sequencing from 9 individuals
with colorectal cancer (114500), including primary colorectal tumors and
matched adjacent nontumor tissues, at an average of 30.7x and 31.9x
coverage, respectively. They identified an average of 75 somatic
rearrangements per tumor, including complex networks of translocations
between pairs of chromosomes. Eleven rearrangements encode predicted
in-frame fusion proteins, including a fusion of VTI1A (614316) and
TCF7L2 found in 3 out of 97 colorectal cancers. Although TCF7L2 encodes
TCF4, which cooperates with beta-catenin in colorectal carcinogenesis,
the fusion lacks the TCF4 beta-catenin-binding domain. Bass et al.
(2011) found a colorectal carcinoma cell line harboring the fusion gene
to be dependent on VTI1A-TCF7L2 for anchorage-independent growth using
RNA interference-mediated knockdown.

MAPPING

Duval et al. (2000) mapped the TCF7L2 gene to chromosome 10q25.3 by
FISH.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Duval et al. (2000) performed a mutation screen of a series of 24
colorectal cancer cell lines using denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis (DGGE) and/or direct sequencing. They found a total of
12 variants, of which 8 were in coding regions. The variants included 4
examples of the deletion of an A in an (A)9 coding repeat previously
identified in a colorectal cancer cell line by Duval et al. (1999).

Reynisdottir et al. (2003) found suggestive linkage of type 2 diabetes
mellitus (NIDDM; 125853) to 10q in an Icelandic population. The 10q
linkage region had also been observed in Mexican Americans (Duggirala et
al., 1999). Grant et al. (2006) genotyped 228 microsatellite markers in
Icelandic individuals with type 2 diabetes and controls throughout a
10.5-Mb interval on 10q. A microsatellite, DG10S478, within intron 3 of
the TCF7L2 gene was associated with type 2 diabetes; p = 2.1 x 10(-9).
This was replicated in a Danish cohort, p = 4.8 x 10(-3), and also in a
U.S. cohort, p = 3.3 x 10(-9). Two SNPs, dbSNP rs12255372 (602228.0002)
and dbSNP rs7903146 (602228.0001), were in strong linkage disequilibrium
with DG10S478 and showed similarly robust associations with type 2
diabetes (p less than 10(-15)). Compared with noncarriers, heterozygous
and homozygous carriers of the at-risk alleles (38% and 7% of the
population, respectively) have relative risks of 1.45 and 2.41. This
corresponds to a population-attributable risk of 21%.

Florez et al. (2006) tested whether the 2 SNPS identified by Grant et
al. (2006) predicted the progression to diabetes in persons with
impaired glucose tolerance in a diabetes prevention program in which
lifestyle intervention or treatment with metformin was compared with
placebo. The 2 SNPs appeared to be associated with an increased risk of
diabetes among persons with impaired glucose tolerance. The
risk-conferring genotypes in TCF7L2 were associated with impaired
beta-cell function but not with insulin resistance.

To find genetic variants influencing susceptibility to type 2 diabetes,
Sladek et al. (2007) tested 392,935 SNPs in a French case-control
cohort. Markers with the most significant difference in genotype
frequencies between cases of type 2 diabetes and controls were
fast-tracked for testing in a second cohort. This identified 4 loci
containing variants that confer type 2 diabetes risk, in addition to
confirming the known association with the TCF7L2 gene. These loci
included a nonsynonymous polymorphism in the zinc transporter SLC30A8
(611145), which is expressed exclusively in insulin-producing beta
cells, and 2 linkage disequilibrium blocks that contain genes
potentially involved in beta cell development or function: IDE
(146680)-KIF11 (148760)-HHEX (604420) and EXT2 (608210)-ALX4 (605420).
Sladek et al. (2007) concluded that these associations explained a
substantial portion of disease risk and constituted proof of principle
for the genomewide approach to the elucidation of complex genetic
traits.

Using a logistic regression model incorporating individual ancestry,
sex, age, body mass index, and education in 286 Mexican patients with
type 2 diabetes mellitus and 275 controls, Parra et al. (2007) analyzed
the DG10S478 microsatellite in intron 3 and 2 SNPs, dbSNP rs12255372 and
dbSNP rs7903146, in introns 4 and 3, respectively, of the TCF7L2 gene.
All 3 markers were in tight disequilibrium in this Mexican sample. Parra
et al. (2007) observed a significant association between dbSNP
rs12255372 and DG10S478 with type 2 diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.78, p =
0.017, and OR = 1.62, p = 0.041, respectively). The results for dbSNP
rs7903146 were not significant.

Zeggini et al. (2007) performed a genomewide association study of type 2
diabetes using data for 1,924 diabetic cases and 2,938 population
controls generated by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (2007)
and analysis of 3,757 additional cases and 5,346 controls, as well as
equivalent data from other international consortia. The strongest
association signals genomewide were observed for SNPs in the TCF7L2
gene. At SNP dbSNP rs7901695 an odds ratio of 1.37, CI = 1.25-1.49, p =
6.7 x 10(-13) was achieved. This SNP was in strong linkage
disequilibrium with dbSNP rs7903146. In a similar study by Scott et al.
(2007), the dbSNP rs7903146 SNP reached genomewide significance in the
all-data metaanalysis with an OR of 1.37, p = 1.0 x 10(-48). In the
study of the Diabetes Genetics Initiative of Broad Institute of Harvard
and MIT, Lund University, and Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Reserch
(2007), TCF7L2 was the third ranked association (P less than 10(-6)),
and the authors noted that this association was among the top results in
the whole-genome scans of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium
(2007), Scott et al. (2007), and Sladek et al. (2007). The consistency
of these findings suggested that TCF7L2 is the single largest effect of
a common SNP on type 2 diabetes risk in European populations.

In 2 cohorts of Scandinavian subjects followed for 22 years, Lyssenko et
al. (2007) found that the CT/TT genotypes of dbSNP rs7903146 strongly
predicted future type 2 diabetes. Extensive metabolic studies in a
subset of Swedish and Finnish individuals from the cohort indicated that
increased risk of type 2 diabetes conferred by TCF7L2 variants involves
the enteroinsular axis, enhanced expression of the gene in islets, and
impaired insulin secretion.

Ng et al. (2007) examined 22 SNPs spanning the TCF7L2 gene for
association with type 2 diabetes in Hong Kong Chinese. In a case-control
study, they replicated an association with dbSNP rs11196205
(602228.0003) (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.04-4.26), previously identified in
Japanese. They did not find an association with dbSNP rs7903146 (OR,
1.27; 95% CI, 0.71-2.29), previously identified in Caucasians, but did
identify another SNP, dbSNP rs11196218 G allele, located in an adjacent
linkage disequilibrium block, that conferred independent risk for type 2
diabetes (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.14-1.79) and contributed high-population
attributable risk of 42%. They replicated the association with dbSNP
rs11196218 and its haplotype for type 2 diabetes in a family sample (p
less than 0.05).

Miyake et al. (2008) analyzed 5 SNPs in the TCF7L2 gene in 2,214
Japanese individuals with type 2 diabetes and 1,873 controls and
replicated significant association with the minor alleles of dbSNP
rs7903146, dbSNP rs12255372, and dbSNP rs11196205, confirming that
TCF7S2 is an important susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes in the
Japanese population. They did not, however, replicate previously
reported associations with dbSNP rs11196218 or dbSNP rs290487.

ANIMAL MODEL

To study the physiologic role of Tcf4 (which is encoded by the Tcf7l2
gene), Korinek et al. (1998) disrupted Tcf7l2 by homologous
recombination. The homozygous-null mice died shortly after birth. A
single histopathologic abnormality was observed. An apparently normal
transition of intestinal endoderm into epithelium occurred at
approximately embryonic day (E) 14.5. However, no proliferative
compartments were maintained in the prospective crypt regions between
the villi. As a consequence, the neonatal epithelium was composed
entirely of differentiated, nondividing villus cells. Korinek et al.
(1998) concluded that the genetic program controlled by Tcf7l2 maintains
the crypt stem cells of the small intestine. The constitutive activity
of Tcf4 in APC-deficient epithelial cells may contribute to their
malignant transformation by maintaining stem cell characteristics.

Nguyen et al. (2009) found that knockout of Tcf3 or Tcf4 individually
had no overt effect on hair phenotype in mice, but Tcf3/Tcf4 double
knockout resulted in a severe skin and hair defects. Newborn
Tcf3/Tcf4-null skin was thinner than normal and often lacked whiskers.
Tcf3/Tcf4-null skin showed signs of apoptosis and, when grafted onto
nude mice, became shrunken, was unable to repair wounds, and was
progressively lost, showing an inability to maintain long-term
self-renewing populations of skin epithelia. Tcf3/Tcf4-null skin cells
grew poorly in culture and did not survive passaging. Microarray
analysis of mRNAs expressed by normal and Tcf3/Tcf4-null skin suggested
that Tcf3 and Tcf4 maintain skin epithelial stem cells through
Wnt-dependent and Wnt-independent signaling.

Shu et al. (2009) showed robust differences in TCF7L2 expression in
pancreatic beta cells of rodent models of type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM). While mRNA levels were approximately 2-fold increased in
isolated islets from the diabetic db/db mouse, the Vancouver Diabetic
Fatty (VDF) Zucker rat, and the high fat/high sucrose diet-treated mouse
compared with the nondiabetic rodent controls, protein levels were
decreased.

Savic et al. (2011) found that Tcf7l2 -/- mice were born at the expected
mendelian ratio, but they were hypoglycemic at birth and died within 24
hours. Tcf7l2 +/- mice were leaner than wildtype littermates and
displayed enhanced glucose tolerance when fed a high-fat diet. Mice
engineered to carry up to 3 extra copies of Tcf7l2 driven by a 92-kb
human TCF7L2 promoter region developed dose-dependent glucose
intolerance, with elevated fasting insulin levels compared with wildtype
littermates.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DIABETES MELLITUS, NONINSULIN-DEPENDENT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
TCF7L2, IVS3, C-T (dbSNP rs7903146)

In an Icelandic population, Grant et al. (2006) found strong linkage
disequilibrium between a SNP in the TCF7L2 gene, dbSNP rs7903146, and a
microsatellite marker in intron 3, DG10S478, associated with type 2
diabetes (125853) (p = 2.1 x 10(-9)).

Helgason et al. (2007) refined the definition of the TCF7L2 type 2
diabetes risk variant, HapB(T2D), to the ancestral T allele of the SNP
dbSNP rs7903146 through replication in West African and Danish type 2
diabetes case-control studies and an expanded Icelandic study. They also
identified another variant of the same gene, HapA, that shows evidence
of positive selection in East Asian, European, and West African
populations. Notably, HapA shows a suggestive association with body mass
index (BMI) and altered concentrations of the hunger-satiety hormones
ghrelin (GHRL; 605353) and leptin (LEP; 164160) in males, indicating
that the selective advantage of HapA may have been mediated through
effects on energy metabolism.

Type 2 diabetes genes may influence birthweight through maternal
genotype, by increasing maternal glycemia in pregnancy, or through fetal
genotype, by altering fetal insulin secretion. Freathy et al. (2007)
assessed the role of the TCF7L2 gene in birthweight. They genotyped the
polymorphism dbSNP rs7903146 in 15,709 individuals whose birthweight was
available from 6 studies and in 8,344 mothers from 3 studies. Each fetal
copy of the predisposing allele was associated with an 18-gram increase
in birthweight (p = 0.001) and each maternal copy with a 30-gram
increase in offspring birthweight (p = 2.8 x 10(-5)).. Stratification by
fetal genotype suggested that the association was driven by maternal
genotype. Analysis of diabetes-related traits in 10,314 nondiabetic
individuals suggested that the most likely mechanism is that the risk
allele reduces maternal insulin secretion, which results in increased
maternal glycemia in pregnancy and hence increased offspring
birthweight. Freathy et al. (2007) combined information from the other
common variant known to alter fetal growth, the -30G-A polymorphism of
glucokinase (138079). The 4% of offspring born to mothers carrying 3 or
4 risk alleles were 119 grams heavier than were the 32% born to mothers
with none, comparable to the impact of maternal smoking during
pregnancy. Freathy et al. (2007) concluded that this was the first type
2 diabetes susceptibility allele to be reproducibly associated with
birthweight. Thus, common gene variants can substantially influence
normal birthweight variation.

In a study of 286 Mexican patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 275
controls, Parra et al. (2007) did not find a significant association
between dbSNP rs7903146 and the disease.

In genomewide association studies of type 2 diabetes, The Diabetes
Genetics Initiative of Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Lund
University, and Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Reserch (2007),
Zeggini et al. (2007), and Scott et al. (2007) confirmed association of
the SNP dbSNP rs7903146 with diabetes susceptibility. Scott et al.
(2007) obtained an OR of 1.37, p = 1.0 x 10(-48) for dbSNP rs7903146 in
a metaanalysis of data from international consortia.

In a genomewide association study for type 2 diabetes in 1,399 Icelandic
cases and 5,275 controls, Steinthorsdottir et al. (2007) found that
dbSNP rs7903146 conferred the most significant risk, with an OR of 1.38
and p = 1.82 x 10(-10) in all individuals with type 2 diabetes.

Mayans et al. (2007) genotyped 4 SNPs in the TCF7L2 gene in 872 Swedish
patients with type 2 diabetes and 857 age-, sex-, and
geographically-matched controls and replicated the previously identified
association between dbSNP rs7093146 and disease (p = 0.00002).

In 2 cohorts of Scandinavian subjects followed for 22 years, Lyssenko et
al. (2007) found that the CT/TT genotypes of dbSNP rs7903146 strongly
predicted future type 2 diabetes. Extensive metabolic studies in a
subset of Swedish and Finnish individuals from the cohort showed that
the risk T allele was associated with impaired insulin secretion,
incretin effects, and an enhanced rate of hepatic glucose production.
TCF7L2 expression in human islets was increased 5-fold in type 2
diabetes, particularly in carriers of the TT genotype; overexpression of
TCF7L2 in human islets reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.

Ng et al. (2007) examined 22 SNPs spanning the TCF7L2 gene in 433 Hong
Kong Chinese hospitalized with early-onset type 2 diabetes and 419
controls and did not find a significant association with dbSNP
rs7903146.

Miyake et al. (2008) analyzed 5 SNPs in the TCF7L2 gene in 2,214
Japanese individuals with type 2 diabetes and 1,873 controls and
confirmed significant association with the minor allele of dbSNP
rs7903146 (OR, 1.48; p = 2.7 x 10(-4)). The association remained
significant after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI (adjusted p =
0.0011).

To identify regulatory DNA active in human pancreatic islets, Gaulton et
al. (2010) profiled chromatin by formaldehyde-assisted isolation of
regulatory elements coupled with high-throughput sequencing (FAIRE-seq).
By mapping sequence variants to open chromatin sites, they found that
dbSNP rs7903146 is located in islet-selective open chromatin. In
addition, human islet samples heterozygous for dbSNP rs7903146 showed
allelic imbalance in islet FAIRE signals, with the chromatin state more
open in chromosomes carrying the risk 'T' allele. Using allele-specific
luciferase reporter constructs in islet beta-cell lines, Gaulton et al.
(2010) demonstrated that the dbSNP rs7903146 variant alters enhancer
activity, indicating that genetic variation at this locus acts in cis
with local chromatin and regulatory changes.

Prokunina-Olsson et al. (2009) stated that dbSNP rs7903146 in intron 3
and dbSNP rs12255372 (602228.0002) in intron 4 are 50 kb apart and
within a 92-kb block of linkage disequilibrium. Savic et al. (2011)
found that the 92-kb region containing dbSNP rs7903146 had strong
enhancer activity when expressed in transgenic mice.

.0002
DIABETES MELLITUS, NONINSULIN-DEPENDENT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
TCF7L2, IVS4, G-T (dbSNP rs12255372)

In an Icelandic population, Grant et al. (2006) found strong linkage
disequilibrium between a SNP in intron 4 of the TCF7L2 gene, dbSNP
rs12255372, and a microsatellite marker in intron 3, DG10S478,
associated with type 2 diabetes (125853) (p = 2.1 x 10(-9)).

Using a logistic regression model incorporating individual ancestry,
sex, age, body mass index, and education in 286 Mexican patients with
type 2 diabetes mellitus and 275 controls, Parra et al. (2007) analyzed
the DG10S478 microsatellite in intron 3 and dbSNP rs12255372 in intron 4
of the TCF7L2 gene. All 3 markers were in tight disequilibrium in the
Mexican sample. Parra et al. (2007) observed a significant association
between dbSNP rs12255372 and DG10S478 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (OR =
1.78, p = 0.017, and OR = 1.62, p = 0.041, respectively).

Mayans et al. (2007) genotyped 4 SNPs in the TCF7L2 gene in 872 Swedish
patients with type 2 diabetes and 857 age-, sex-, and
geographically-matched controls and replicated the previously identified
association between dbSNP rs12255372 and disease (p = 0.000004).

Miyake et al. (2008) analyzed 5 SNPs in the TCF7L2 gene in 2,214
Japanese individuals with type 2 diabetes and 1,873 controls and
confirmed significant association with the minor allele of dbSNP
rs12255372 (OR, 1.70; p = 9.8 x 10(-5)). The association remained
significant after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI (adjusted p = 7.0 x
10(-4)).

Ng et al. (2007) examined 22 SNPs spanning the TCF7L2 gene for
association with type 2 diabetes in Hong Kong Chinese. In a case-control
study, they replicated an association with the at-risk C allele of dbSNP
rs11196205 (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.04-4.26), previously identified in a
Japanese population (see Hayashi et al., 2007).

Miyake et al. (2008) analyzed 5 SNPs in the TCF7L2 gene in 2,214
Japanese individuals with type 2 diabetes and 1,873 controls and
confirmed significant association with the minor allele of dbSNP
rs11196205 (OR, 1.39; p = 4.6 x 10(-4)). The association remained
significant after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI (adjusted p =
0.0053).

600864	TITLE *600864 CASEIN KINASE I, DELTA; CSNK1D
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CSNK1D gene encodes an isoform of casein kinase I, which is a
ubiquitous serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that constitutes
most of the kinase activity in eukaryotic cells, where it is distributed
in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and membrane fractions (summary by Kusuda et
al., 1996). CSNK1D is enriched in the brain (summary by Zhou et al.,
2010).

CLONING

Graves et al. (1993) cloned a full-length rat CKI-delta cDNA.

Kusuda et al. (1996) isolated and sequenced a cDNA clone for human
casein kinase I. An open reading frame of 415 amino acids was
identified, showing 97% homology to rat CKI-delta; within the kinase
domain of 284 amino acids the 2 were identical. The similarity of the
amino acid sequence of the kinase domain of human CSNK1D to yeast
enzymes that are involved in the repair of DNA strand breaks supported
speculation that the human gene product acts in DNA metabolism through
excision and recombinational repair.

MAPPING

Fish et al. (1995) mapped the human CKI-delta locus to 17q25 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and PCR analysis of human/rodent
hybrid cell panels, Kusuda et al. (1996) mapped CSNK1D to 17q25.2-q25.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Lord et al. (2011) used a yeast transport assay to demonstrate that an
endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicle retains its coat until it
reaches the Golgi. A Golgi-associated kinase, Hrr25p, which is a
CKI-delta ortholog, then phosphorylates the Sec23p (see 610511)/Sec24p
(see 607183) complex. Coat phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are
needed for vesicle fusion and budding, respectively. Additionally, Lord
et al. (2011) showed that Sec23p interacts in a sequential manner with
different binding partners, including the tethering factor complex
TRAPPI (see 610397) and Hrr25p, to ensure the directionality of ER-Golgi
traffic and prevent the back-fusion of a COPII vesicle with the ER. Lord
et al. (2011) stated that these events are conserved in mammalian cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Xu et al. (2005) identified a thr44-to-ala mutation in the CSNK1D gene
(T44A; 600864.0001) that cosegregated with familial advanced sleep phase
syndrome-2 (FASPS2; 615224) in a 3-generation family. The mutant kinase
showed decreased enzymatic activity in vitro. Transgenic Drosophila
carrying the human CKI-delta-T44A gene showed a phenotype with
lengthened circadian period. In contrast, transgenic mice carrying the
same mutation had a shorter circadian period, a phenotype mimicking
human FASPS. Xu et al. (2005) showed that CKI-delta is a central
component in the mammalian clock and that mammalian and Drosophila
clocks might have different regulatory mechanisms, despite the highly
conserved nature of their individual components.

Brennan et al. (2013) found that 5 of the mutation carriers with FASPS2
in the family reported by Xu et al. (2005) had migraine with or without
aura. One mutation carrier who did not have FASPS also had migraine.
However, 3 family members who were offspring of carriers but did not
carry the mutation also had migraine. In vitro functional expression
studies showed that the T44A mutant enzyme had significantly reduced
kinase activity compared to wildtype. Transgenic mice carrying the T44A
mutation were more sensitive to pain after treatment with the migraine
trigger nitroglycerin, and showed a reduced threshold for cortical
spreading depression, which is believed to be the physiologic analog of
migraine aura, as well as greater arterial dilation during cortical
spreading depression. The mutant enzyme showed decreased phosphorylation
of GJA1 (121014), which is a mediator of astrocyte signaling. Astrocytes
derived from mutant mice showed increased spontaneous and evoked calcium
signaling, which may underlie some of the vascular changes associated
with cortical spreading depression. These results suggested that
decreased CSNK1D activity can contribute to the pathogenesis of
migraine. Affected members of a second family with FASPS2 with or
without migraine carried a different heterozygous mutation in the CSNK1D
gene (H46R; 600864.0002).

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhou et al. (2010) found that mice with targeted overexpression of the
Csnk1d gene in the forebrain and striatum exhibited hyperactivity,
decreased anxiety, increased impulsivity, and defects in nesting
behavior compared to wildtype mice. Mutant mice also showed paradoxical
responses to dopamine receptor stimulation, showing hypoactivity
following injection of amphetamine or methylphenidate and certain
dopamine agonists. Csnk1d overexpression was also associated with
downregulation of DRD1 (126449) and DRD2 (126450) receptor levels. The
behavioral characteristics in these mice were reminiscent of the
symptoms and drug responses observed in attention deficit-hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD; 143465) in humans.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ADVANCED SLEEP PHASE SYNDROME, FAMILIAL, 2
CSNK1D, THR44ALA

In a 3-generation family segregating autosomal dominant familial
advanced sleep phase syndrome-2 (FASPS2; 615224), Xu et al. (2005)
identified a heterozygous A-to-G transition in the CSNK1D gene,
resulting in a thr44-to-ala substitution (T44A). This mutation occurs at
a residue that is conserved for mammalian CKIs through Drosophila CKI,
and was not identified in over 250 control DNA samples.

Brennan et al. (2013) found that 5 of the mutation carriers with FASPS2
in the family reported by Xu et al. (2005) had migraine with or without
aura. One mutation carrier who did not have FASPS also had migraine.
However, 3 family members who were offspring of carriers but did not
carry the mutation also had migraine. Brennan et al. (2013) noted that
the T44A substitution occurred at a highly conserved residue and was not
found in more than 2,600 control chromosomes. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the T44A mutant enzyme had significantly
reduced kinase activity compared to wildtype. Transgenic mice carrying
the T44A mutation were more sensitive to pain after treatment with the
migraine trigger nitroglycerin, and showed a reduced threshold for
cortical spreading depression, which is believed to be the physiologic
analog of migraine aura, as well as greater arterial dilation during
cortical spreading depression. The mutant enzyme showed decreased
phosphorylation of GJA1 (121014), which is a mediator of astrocyte
signaling. Astrocytes derived from mutant mice showed increased
spontaneous and evoked calcium signaling, which may underlie some of the
vascular changes associated with cortical spreading depression. These
results suggested that decreased CSNK1D activity can contribute to the
pathogenesis of migraine. The relationship between the sleep alterations
and migraine was unclear.

.0002
ADVANCED SLEEP PHASE SYNDROME, FAMILIAL, 2
CSNK1D, HIS46ARG

In affected members of a family with FASPS2 (615224), Brennan et al.
(2013) identified a heterozygous mutation in the CSNK1D gene resulting
in a his46-to-arg (H46R) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The
mutation was not found in over 2,600 control chromosomes. Only 1 family
member without the mutation had migraine. In vitro functional expression
studies showed that the H46R mutant enzyme had a 53% reduction in kinase
activity compared to wildtype.

600842	TITLE *600842 GLUCOKINASE REGULATORY PROTEIN; GCKR
;;GKRP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Glucokinase (GCK; 138079) in the liver and pancreatic beta cells is
subject to inhibition by a regulatory protein, GCKR. The inhibitory
effect of GCKR depends on the presence of fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) and
is antagonized by fructose-1-phosphate (F1P). Warner et al. (1995) noted
that mutations in GCKR might be diabetogenic if they resulted in the
synthesis of proteins with increased inhibitory activity, perhaps
reflecting increased sensitivity to fructose-6-phosphate or reduced
susceptibility to antagonism by fructose-1-phosphate. Warner et al.
(1995) determined the complete sequence of human GCKR cDNA. The GCKR
cDNA encodes a protein of 625 amino acids. Given the role of glucokinase
in the causation of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) type II
(125851), GCKR had been considered a candidate gene for a form of MODY.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hayward et al. (1998) determined that the GCKR gene contains 19 exons
and spans 27 kb.

MAPPING

Warner et al. (1995) isolated YAC clones containing human GCKR and
localized them to chromosome 2p23 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Vaxillaire et al. (1994) had previously assigned the GCKR gene to
chromosome 2p23-p22.3.

Hayward et al. (1996) demonstrated that the GCKR gene lies within 500 kb
of the gene encoding ketohexokinase (229800). By high-resolution
fluorescence in situ hybridization, they refined the localization of the
GCKR gene to chromosome 2p23.3-p23.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

A common GCKR variant (P446L; dbSNP rs1260326; 600842.0001) is
associated with triglyceride and fasting plasma glucose levels (FGQTL5;
613463) in the general population. In a series of transfection
experiments using wildtype and P446L-GKRP, Beer et al. (2009) reported
reduced regulation by physiologic concentrations of F6P in the presence
of P446L-GKRP, resulting indirectly in increased GCK activity. Assays
matched for GKRP activity demonstrated no difference in dose-dependent
inhibition of GCK activity or F1P-mediated regulation. Quantitative
RT-PCR analysis showed that GCKR is highly expressed relative to GCK in
human liver and has very low expression in human pancreatic islets
relative to GCK. The authors noted that altered GCK regulation in liver
is predicted to enhance glycolytic flux, promoting hepatic glucose
metabolism and elevating concentrations of malonyl-CoA (a substrate for
de novo lipogenesis). Beer et al. (2009) proposed this as a mutational
mechanism for the association of the leu446 allele with raised
triglycerides and lower glucose levels.

Suhre et al. (2011) reported a comprehensive analysis of
genotype-dependent metabolic phenotypes using a GWAS with nontargeted
metabolomics. They identified 37 genetic loci associated with blood
metabolite concentrations, of which 25 showed effect sizes that were
unusually high for GWAS and accounted for 10 to 60% differences in
metabolite levels per allele copy. These associations provided new
functional insights for many disease-related associations that had been
reported in previous studies, including those for cardiovascular and
kidney disorders, type 2 diabetes, cancer, gout, venous thromboembolism,
and Crohn disease. Suhre et al. (2011) identified dbSNP rs780094 in the
GCKR gene as associated with glucose/mannose ratio with a p value value
of 5.5 x 10(-53).

ANIMAL MODEL

To further understand the role of glucokinase regulatory protein, which
they symbolized GKRP, Farrelly et al. (1999) inactivated the mouse
homolog. With the knockout of the mouse gene, there was a parallel loss
of glucokinase protein and activity in mutant mouse liver. The loss was
primarily because of posttranscriptional regulation of glucokinase,
indicating a positive regulatory role for GKRP in maintaining
glucokinase levels and activity. As in rat hepatocytes, both glucokinase
and GKRP were localized in the nuclei of mouse hepatocytes cultured in
low glucose-containing medium. In the presence of fructose or high
concentrations of glucose, conditions known to relieve glucokinase
inhibition by GKRP in vitro, only glucokinase was translocated into the
cytoplasm. In the GKRP-mutant hepatocytes, glucokinase was not found in
the nucleus under any tested conditions. Farrelly et al. (1999) proposed
that GKRP functions as an anchor to sequester and inhibit glucokinase in
the hepatocyte nucleus, where it is protected from degradation. This
ensures that glucose phosphorylation is minimal when the liver is in the
fasting, glucose-producing phase. This also enables the hepatocytes
rapidly to mobilize glucokinase into the cytoplasm to phosphorylate and
store or metabolize glucose after the ingestion of dietary glucose. In
GKRP-mutant mice, the disruption of this regulation and the subsequent
decrease in GK activity led to altered glucose metabolism and impaired
glycemic control.

Grimsby et al. (2000) found that wildtype and Gckr-null mice had
comparable glucokinase activity at physiologic glucose concentrations.
However, following a glucose tolerance test, the homozygous knockout
mice showed impaired glucose clearance, indicating that they could not
recruit sufficient glucokinase due to the absence of a nuclear reserve.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE LEVEL QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCUS 5
GCKR, PRO446LEU (dbSNP rs1260326)

Beer et al. (2009) noted that the 1403C-T transition (dbSNP rs1260326)
in the GCKR gene results in a pro446-to-leu (P446L) substitution at a
conserved residue in the glucokinase regulatory protein. Residue 446
lies between 2 motifs thought to be directly involved in binding of
phosphate esters.

By genomewide association studies, Orho-Melander et al. (2008) showed
that the intronic dbSNP rs780094 variant of the GCKR gene was associated
with higher plasma triglyceride levels (p = 3 x 10(-56)) but lower
fasting plasma glucose levels (p = 1 x 10(-13)) (FGQTL5; 613463).
Fine-mapping by genotyping and imputing SNPs across the GCKR locus
identified a common 1403C-T transition, resulting in a pro446-to-leu
(P446L; dbSNP rs1260326) substitution, as the strongest signal for
association with triglycerides. The dbSNP rs1260326 SNP shows strong
linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 0.93) with dbSNP rs780094 and has a minor
allele frequency of 0.34.

In 4,833 middle-aged French individuals, Vaxillaire et al. (2008) found
that the minor T allele of the P446L (dbSNP rs1260326) SNP was strongly
associated with lower fasting glucose levels and fasting insulin levels,
and conversely, higher triglyceride levels.

Dupuis et al. (2010) performed metaanalyses of 21 genomewide association
studies informative for fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and indices of
beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in up to
46,186 nondiabetic participants. Follow-up of 25 loci in up to 76,558
additional subjects identified 16 loci associated with fasting glucose
and HOMA-B and 2 loci associated with fasting insulin and HOMA-IR.
Dupuis et al. (2010) identified association of elevation of fasting
blood glucose (p = 5.6 x 10(-38)) and decreased triglyceride levels (p =
9.6 x 10(-17)) with the C allele of the intronic C-T SNP (dbSNP
rs780094) in the GCKR gene on chromosome 2p23.3-p23.2. This variant was
also associated with fasting insulin levels (3.0 x 10(-24)).

In a series of transfection experiments using wildtype and P446L-GKRP,
Beer et al. (2009) reported reduced regulation by physiologic
concentrations of F6P in the presence of P446L-GKRP, resulting
indirectly in increased GCK activity. Assays matched for GKRP activity
demonstrated no difference in dose-dependent inhibition of GCK activity
or F1P-mediated regulation. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that
GCKR is highly expressed relative to GCK in human liver and has very low
expression in human pancreatic islets relative to GCK. The authors noted
that altered GCK regulation in liver is predicted to enhance glycolytic
flux, promoting hepatic glucose metabolism and elevating concentrations
of malonyl-CoA (a substrate for de novo lipogenesis). Beer et al. (2009)
proposed this as a mutational mechanism for the association of the
leu446 allele with raised triglycerides and lower glucose levels.

602876	TITLE *602876 OCCLUDIN; OCLN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Occludin is an integral membrane protein that is located at tight
junctions (Ando-Akatsuka et al., 1996). It is a member of a family of
proteins containing the highly conserved Marvel domain, which contains 4
transmembrane-helix regions. The Marvel domain has functional importance
in proteins involved in epithelial membrane apposition (review by
Sanchez-Pulido et al., 2002).

CLONING

By screening a human intestinal cell line cDNA library with a PCR
product that was generated using oligonucleotides based on the chicken
occludin-like sequence near the human NAIP gene (600355), Ando-Akatsuka
et al. (1996) cloned cDNAs encoding OCLN. The predicted 522-amino acid
protein has 4 transmembrane domains in its N-terminal half. The first
extracellular loop, which may be involved in tight cell-cell coupling,
contains 63% tyrosine or glycine residues. The C-terminal 150 amino
acids, which may interact with TJP1 (601009), contains a predicted
alpha-helical coiled-coil structure. Immunofluorescence analysis of a
human intestinal epithelial cell line detected OCLN specifically at
tight junctions.

By RT-PCR of human HT-29/B6 intestinal cell, placenta, and colon RNA,
Mankertz et al. (2002) obtained a full-length occludin clone identical
to that reported by Ando-Akatsuka et al. (1996), which they called type
I, as well as 3 additional splice variants, which they called types II,
III, and IV. Occludin types II, III, and IV have different in-frame
deletions relative to occludin type I, and occludin types II and III
encode proteins lacking transmembrane domain 4. Mankertz et al. (2002)
also identified occludin transcripts containing an alternative noncoding
first exon, exon 1A. Confocal microscopy of transfected HT-29/B6 cells
revealed fluorescence-tagged occludin types I and IV localized to the
plasma membrane, with high accumulation in tight junctions. In contrast,
occludin types II and III distributed in intracellular compartments.

In wildtype adult mice, O'Driscoll et al. (2010) found prominent
occludin expression in layers 2/3 of the cerebral cortex and in Purkinje
cells of the cerebellum.

Using immunofluorescence analysis, Du et al. (2010) found that occludin
localized to the leading edge of migrating MCDK canine kidney cells, in
addition to tight junctions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mankertz et al. (2002) determined that the OCLN gene contains 9 exons
plus an alternative first exon that they called exon 1A. Exons 1 and 1A
are noncoding and are associated with unique promoter regions. Exon 1A
contains potential binding sites for several transcription factors,
including AP2 (see 107580) and MYB (189990), as well as a GC box.

MAPPING

O'Driscoll et al. (2010) noted that the OCLN gene maps to chromosome
5q13.2.

- Pseudogene

O'Driscoll et al. (2010) noted that the full-length OCLN gene has a
pseudogene approximately 1.5 Mb away containing a copy of OCLN exons 6
to 9 within a 500-kb inverted duplication.

GENE FUNCTION

Using reporter gene analysis, Mankertz et al. (2002) showed that the
proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha (TNF; 191160) downregulated
expression mediated by the alternative promoter associated with occludin
exon 1A.

Barrios-Rodiles et al. (2005) developed LUMIER (luminescence-based
mammalian interactome mapping), an automated high-throughput technology,
to map protein-protein interaction networks systematically in mammalian
cells and applied it to the TGF-beta (see 190180) pathway. Analysis
using self-organizing maps and k-means clustering identified links of
the TGF-beta pathway to the p21-activated kinase (PAK1; see 602590)
network, to the polarity complex, and to occludin. Barrios-Rodiles et
al. (2005) showed the occludin regulates TGF-beta receptor type I
(190181) localization for efficient TGF-beta-dependent dissolution of
tight junctions during epithelial-mesenchymal transitions.

Using an iterative cDNA library screening approach, Ploss et al. (2009)
showed that human occludin is an essential hepatitis C virus (HCV) cell
entry factor that is able to render murine cells infectable with HCV
glycoproteins. Similarly, occludin is required for the HCV
susceptibility of human cells, because its overexpression in
uninfectable cells specifically enhanced HCV glycoprotein uptake,
whereas its silencing in permissive cells impaired infection both by HCV
glycoprotein and HCV produced in cell culture. In addition to occludin,
HCV glycoprotein infection of murine cells required expression of the
previously identified HCV entry factors CD81 (186845), scavenger
receptor class B type I (SCARB1; 601040) and claudin-1 (CLDN1; 603718).
Although the mouse versions of SCARB1 and CLDN1 function at least as
well as the human proteins in promoting HCV entry, both OCLN and CD81
must be of human origin to allow efficient infection. The
species-specific determinants of OCLN were mapped to its second
extracellular loop. Ploss et al. (2009) concluded that the
identification of OCLN as a new HCV entry factor further highlighted the
importance of the tight junction complex in the viral entry process, and
provided an important advance towards efforts to develop small animal
models for HCV.

Using RNA interference, Du et al. (2010) found that knockdown of
occludin impaired the localization of atypical PKC (aPKC; see 176982),
Par3 (PARD; 606745), and Patj (INADL; 603199) at the leading edge of
migrating MDCK cells and caused misorientation of the microtubule
organization center during wound repair. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis
revealed that occludin interacted directly with aPKC in the
occludin/aPKC/Par2/Patj complex. Occludin knockdown also impaired PI3
kinase (see 601232) activation and Rac1 (602048)-dependent lamellipodia
formation. Phosphorylated occludin interacted directly with the
p85-alpha regulatory subunit of PI3 kinase (PIK3R1; 171833). Du et al.
(2010) concluded that occludin is involved in cell migration and
functions to recruit active PI3 kinase to the leading edge, resulting in
RAC1 activation and formation of lamellipodia.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 9 individuals from 6 families with autosomal recessive band-like
calcification with simplified gyration and polymicrogyria (BLCPMG;
251290), O'Driscoll et al. (2010) identified homozygous or compound
heterozygous mutations in the OCLN gene (see, e.g.,
602876.0001-602876.0004). Microarray analysis identified homozygous
deletions of copy number probes within exons 3 and 4 in affected
individuals from 2 unrelated but consanguineous families from Egypt and
Turkey, respectively. Affected individuals had congenital microcephaly,
intracranial calcifications, and severe developmental delay. Five of 6
families had deletions or mutations affecting the Marvel domain,
suggesting that the mutations result in a protein product that fails to
locate to the cell membrane and hence to tight junctions. O'Driscoll et
al. (2010) postulated that patients lacking functional occludin may have
a compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) and may be vulnerable to tissue
damage. In addition, the defect may interrupt signaling between cells.
None of the patients had extracerebral abnormalities, suggesting
redundancy in other tissues. The findings indicated that mutations in
the OCLN gene can result in malformations of cortical development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Saitou et al. (2000) found that Ocln-null mice had significant postnatal
growth retardation. Ocln-null males produced no litters with wildtype
females, whereas Ocln-null females produced litters normally when mated
with wildtype males, but did not suckle them. Tight junctions appeared
normal, and the barrier function of intestinal epithelium was normal.
However, histologic abnormalities were found in several tissues,
including chronic inflammation and hyperplasia of the gastric
epithelium, calcification in the brain, testicular atrophy, loss of
cytoplasmic granules in striated duct cells of the salivary gland, and
thinning of the compact bone. These phenotypes suggested a complex role
for occludin in the functioning of tight junctions.

In mice with experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), a mouse model
of a central nervous system inflammatory disease, Argaw et al. (2009)
observed widespread breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
associated with upregulation of astrocyte-derived Vegf (192240) and
decreased expression of Cldn5 (602101) and occludin in the microvascular
endothelium. VEGF was found to specifically downregulate CLDN5 and OCLN
mRNA and protein in cultured human brain microvessel endothelial cells.
Microinjection of VEGF in mouse cerebral cortex disrupted Cldn5 and Ocln
and induced loss of barrier function. Functional studies revealed that
expression of recombinant Cldn5 protected brain microvascular
endothelial cell cultures from a VEGF-induced increase in permeability,
whereas recombinant Ocln expressed under the same promoter was not
protective. The findings implicated VEGF-mediated disruption of
endothelial CLDN5 as a significant mechanism of BBB breakdown in the
inflamed central nervous system. The significance of the role for OCLN
was less clear.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BAND-LIKE CALCIFICATION WITH SIMPLIFIED GYRATION AND POLYMICROGYRIA
OCLN, 22-BP DEL, NT171

In 2 Turkish sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with band-like
calcification with simplified gyration and polymicrogyria (BLCPMG;
251290), O'Driscoll et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 22-bp deletion
(171_193del22) in exon 3 of the OCLN gene, resulting in a frameshift and
deletion of the first 8 amino acids of the conserved Marvel domain. The
family was previously reported by Briggs et al. (2008). The mutation was
not found in 220 control chromosomes.

.0002
BAND-LIKE CALCIFICATION WITH SIMPLIFIED GYRATION AND POLYMICROGYRIA
OCLN, 1-BP DUP, 512A

In 2 British sibs with band-like calcification with simplified gyration
and polymicrogyria (BLCPMG; 251290), O'Driscoll et al. (2010) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in exon 3 of the OCLN gene: a
1-bp duplication (512dupA), resulting in a premature stop codon and
nonsense-mediated decay, and a 656T-C transition, resulting in a
phe219-to-ser (F219S; 602876.0003) substitution in a conserved amino
acid in the extracellular loop between the third and fourth
transmembrane domains. Neither mutation was found in 220 control
chromosomes.

BAND-LIKE CALCIFICATION WITH SIMPLIFIED GYRATION AND POLYMICROGYRIA
OCLN, IVS5DS, G-A, +5

In a Saudi Arabian patient with band-like calcification with simplified
gyration and polymicrogyria (BLCPMG; 251290), O'Driscoll et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous G-to-A transition in the splice donor site of
intron 5 of the OCLN gene, predicted to result in a severe splicing
mutation and exon skipping. The mutation was not found in 220 control
chromosomes.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ribonuclease P (RNase P) removes the 5-prime leader sequences from
precursor tRNA molecules. RNase P consists of an RNA species (H1 RNA),
the POP1 protein (602486), and at least 7 proteins called RPPs. The RPPs
have apparent molecular masses of 14 kD (RPP14), 20 kD (RPP20; 606113),
25 kD (RPP25), 29 kD (RPP29; 606114), 30 kD (RPP30; 606115), 38 kD
(RPP38; 606116), and 40 kD (RPP40; 606117). Patients with scleroderma
(181750) have serum reactive with RNase P, the Th antigen, which is also
referred to as the To antigen, and RPP30 and RPP38 (summary by Jarrous
et al., 1998, 1999).

CLONING

By biochemical purification of RNase P, micropeptide sequence analysis,
and EST database searching, Jarrous et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA
encoding RPP14. The deduced basic protein has 124 amino acids and a
predicted molecular mass of nearly 14 kD. Immunoblot analysis showed
that antibodies to RPP14 or RPP29 precipitate native RNase P.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the RPP14 gene to chromosome 3p14.3 based on an
alignment of the RPP14 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF001175) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

157132	TITLE *157132 MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 4; MAP4
DESCRIPTION Chapin and Bulinski (1991) used a polyclonal antiserum raised against a
HeLa cell microtubule-associated protein of M(r) 210,000 (210-kD MAP or
MAP4), an abundant nonneuronal MAP, to isolate cDNA clones from a human
fetal brain lambda gt11 cDNA expression library. They found that this,
the major human nonneuronal MAP, resembles 2 neuronal MAPs in its
microtubule-binding domain, while most of the molecule has sequences,
and presumably functions, distinct from those of the neuronal MAPs
(e.g., 157130).

West et al. (1991) reported the structure of MAP4 on the basis of
comparisons of the human, mouse, and bovine sequences.

Chapin et al. (1995) isolated clones encoding alternatively spliced
forms of MAP4. One isoform is similar to an isoform of tau (157140) in
structure. The authors mapped human MAP4 gene to 3p21 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization. Mangan and Olmsted (1996) demonstrated that the
murine homolog is located on mouse chromosome 9.

614971	TITLE *614971 TAURINE-UPREGULATED GENE 1, NONCODING; TUG1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), such as TUG1, are thought to
be involved in long-range control of chromatin structure and gene
expression (Khalil et al., 2009).

CLONING

Young et al. (2005) cloned 3 splice variants of mouse Tug1, and they
identified 4 possible splice variants of human TUG1. The human cDNAs
were 3.3, 5.9, 6.4, and 9.7 kb long. Only a single putative 51-residue
ORF within an adequate Kozak context was conserved between mouse and
human, but it was not included in all mouse and human TUG1 variants.
Northern blot analysis detected highest Tug1 expression in mouse cortex
and retina, with lower expression in heart and kidney and weak
expression in muscle and spleen. In situ hybridization revealed Tug1
expression in several areas of the mouse central nervous system at
postnatal day 0, including spinal cord, olfactory epithelium,
hippocampus, and cortex. In developing mouse retina, Tug1 expression
peaked between embryonic day 18 and postnatal day 6. EST database
analysis detected high TUG1 expression in a variety of human tissues.
Young et al. (2005) also detected weak expression of a mouse cDNA that
originated from the Tug1 opposite strand. Database analysis revealed
orthologs of TUG1 in several mammals, but not in lower vertebrates,
nematodes, or flies.

Khalil et al. (2009) developed a method of identifying lincRNAs based on
a distinctive chromatin signature that marked actively transcribed genes
and then selecting for genes that lacked protein-coding potential. Using
this method, they identified TUG1. TUG1 was ubiquitously expressed in
human and mouse tissues and cells. RNA FISH detected TUG1 localized to
nuclear and cytoplasmic foci in human fetal foot fibroblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

Young et al. (2005) showed that taurine upregulated expression of mouse
Tub1 in retina. Knockdown of Tug1 variants in mouse eyes via
electroporation of small interfering RNAs resulted in disrupted retinal
morphology, which was accompanied by signs of apoptosis and altered
retinal gene expression.

Khalil et al. (2009) showed that TUG1 coimmunoprecipitated with SUZ12
(606245), a component of polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2) in human
fetal lung and foot fibroblasts and HeLa cells. TUG1 also
coimmunoprecipitated with the COREST (RCOR; 607675) repressive complex.
TUG1 expression was induced by p53 (TP53; 191170) in response to DNA
damage. Depletion of TUG1 via small interfering RNA resulted in
upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle regulation in fetal lung
and foot fibroblasts. Khalil et al. (2009) concluded that TUG1 is
induced by p53 and represses gene expression via interaction with PCR2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Young et al. (2005) determined that the TUG1 gene contains 3 exons and
spans about 10 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Young et al. (2005) mapped the TUG1 gene
to chromosome 22q12.2. They mapped the mouse Tug1 gene to chromosome
11A1.

603210	TITLE *603210 JERKY, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; JRK
;;JH8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database, Morita et al. (1998) identified a human
infant brain cDNA encoding JRK, which they called JH8 (jerky homolog of
human on chromosome 8). Using this cDNA as a probe, they recovered
additional clones corresponding to the entire JH8 coding region. The
predicted 520-amino acid protein shares 76% and 41% sequence identity
with jerky and HHMJG (603211), respectively. Northern blot analysis
revealed that JH8 is expressed as a 9.5-kb mRNA in all tissues.
Additional smaller bands were also detected.

By realignment sequencing, Moore et al. (2001) determined that the JRK
gene encodes 2 isoforms of 568 and 556 amino acids, produced by
alternative splicing at the 3-prime end of the coding exon. The 48-amino
acid addition extends the highly conserved N terminus and may function
as a DNA-binding domain.

By analyzing the integration pattern of a transgene resulting in the
epilepsy phenotype of the 'jerky' mouse, Toth et al. (1995) isolated and
sequenced the jerky gene, which encodes a 370-amino acid protein with a
molecular mass of 41.7 kD. Toth et al. (1995) reported the sequence of
jerky and a corrected version in a published erratum. The predicted
protein has homology to several nuclear regulatory proteins, including
CENPB (117140), suggesting that jerky might function as a DNA-binding
protein. Moore et al. (2001) reported the revised mouse jerky sequence.
In mice, Donovan et al. (1997) found that the Jrk gene was expressed in
all tissues examined, including brain, liver, lung, spleen, testis, and
ovary. Expression in the central nervous system included the frontal
cortex, brainstem, hippocampus, thalamus, and olfactory bulb.

GENE STRUCTURE

Toth et al. (1995) stated that the JRK gene contains 1 exon.

MAPPING

Toth et al. (1995) mapped the jerky gene to mouse chromosome 15 by
analysis of an interspecific backcross.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and analysis of a radiation hybrid
panel, Morita et al. (1998) mapped the JH8 gene to 8q24. The mouse
chromosome region containing jerky shows homology of synteny with human
chromosome 8q24, suggesting that JH8, rather than HHMJG, is the human
homolog of jerky.

Morita et al. (1999) redefined the location of the JRK gene to be more
than 4 Mb distant from D8S502 and the locus for childhood absence
epilepsy-1 (ECA1; 600131). Moreover, in 2 families with ECA1, Morita et
al. (1999) did not identify mutations in the JRK gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with childhood absence epilepsy evolving to juvenile
myoclonic epilepsy (EIG1; 600669), Moore et al. (2001) identified a de
novo heterozygous variation in the JRK gene (T456M). The mutation was
not present in 200 unaffected controls or 172 patients with epilepsy.
However, no functional studies were reported.

ANIMAL MODEL

Toth et al. (1995) found that insertional inactivation of the mouse
jerky gene resulted in handling-induced whole body jerks, generalized
clonic seizures, and epileptic brain activity. All homozygous animals
displayed seizures. Homozygotes also displayed some degree of kyphosis
of the thoracic spine and were proportionate dwarfs. Approximately half
died before 3 months of age. Approximately 50% of the hemizygous animals
showed generalized clonic seizures. The other hemizygous animals either
displayed seizures limited to the head and limbs or showed no seizure
activity. There was no apparent correlation between the level of jerky
mRNA and the severity of seizures in hemizygotes.

Donovan et al. (1997) demonstrated that Jrk +/- mice had higher
susceptibility to a chemical seizure-provoking agent, resulting seizures
and even occasional death, compared to wildtype. After seizures, levels
of c-Fos (164810) were increased in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus
and to a lesser extent in the amygdala. Jrk -/- mice showed dwarfism,
kyphosis, and shortened life span, and male mice were sterile. The
seizure phenotype in Jrk -/- mice showed incomplete penetrance (71%),
which was not significantly different from the penetrance in hemizygous
mice (51%). These findings suggested a threshold effect in dosage
sensitivity for the seizure phenotype.

;;BETA-GLUCOSIDASE, BILE ACID;;
BILE ACID BETA-GLUCOSIDASE;;
KIAA1605;;
GLUCOSYLCERAMIDASE, NONLYSOSOMAL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The GBA2 gene encodes an enzyme initially identified as a microsomal
beta-glucosidase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of endogenous bile acid
3-O-glucosides (Matern et al., 2001). The enzyme is also a nonlysosomal
glucosylceramidase that catalyzes the conversion of glucosylceramide to
free glucose and ceramide, as well as the reverse reaction consisting in
the transfer of glucose to different lipid substrates. As an enzyme of
sphingolipid metabolism, it plays a role in a variety of cell signaling
responses and in structural components of the plasma membrane (summary
by Martin et al., 2013).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned GBA2, which they designated
KIAA1605. The deduced protein contains 922 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected high GBA2 expression in all adult and fetal tissues examined,
with highest expression in adult heart and brain. High expression was
also detected in all specific adult brain regions examined, with highest
expression in substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, thalamus, and
caudate nucleus.

By searching an EST database for sequences encoding peptide fragments
obtained from purified human liver GBA2, followed by PCR and RACE of a
human liver cDNA library, Matern et al. (2001) cloned GBA2. The 5-prime
UTR of the transcript has a high GC content. The deduced protein
contains 927 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 104.6
kD. GBA2 contains a putative membrane-spanning domain and 2 potential
N-glycosylation sites. However, glycosidase treatment indicated that
GBA2 is not a glycoprotein. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.6-kb
transcript in all tissues examined, with highest expression in brain,
heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and placenta. Lower expression was
detected in liver, spleen, small intestine, and lung, and very low
expression was detected in colon, thymus, and peripheral blood
leukocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Matern et al. (2001) determined that the GBA2 gene spans about 12 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Matern et al. (2001) mapped the GBA2 gene
to chromosome 9.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 11 patients from 4 unrelated families with autosomal recessive
hereditary spastic paraplegia-46 (SPG46; 614409), Martin et al. (2013)
identified 4 different biallelic mutations in the GBA2 gene
(609471.0001-609471.0004). Three of the mutations were truncating and 1
was a missense mutation that was shown to result in complete loss of
enzyme function. The mutations were found by exome sequencing of the
candidate region identified by linkage analysis. The phenotype was
characterized by early onset of progressive spastic paraparesis,
cerebellar ataxia, mental impairment, cataracts, cerebral, cerebellar
and corpus callosum atrophy, and infertility in males.

In 10 patients from 4 unrelated Tunisian families with autosomal
recessive cerebellar ataxia and spasticity, Hammer et al. (2013)
identified 3 different homozygous mutations in the GBA2 gene
(609471.0005-609471.0007). The first mutations were identified by
homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing. The patients presented with
cerebellar ataxia in the first 2 decades of life and later developed
spasticity and axonal neuropathy. Only 1 patient had mild intellectual
impairment, and only 1 had an abnormal brain MRI.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yildiz et al. (2006) generated Gba2-knockout mice and found that they
had normal bile acid metabolism; however, males exhibited impaired
fertility and had globozoospermia with abnormal acrosomes and defective
mobility. Glucosylceramides accumulated in the testes, brains, and
livers of the Gba2-knockout mice but did not cause obvious neurologic
symptoms, organomegaly, or reduction in life span. In GBA2-transfected
simian COS and human embryonic kidney cells, the authors demonstrated
that GBA2 hydrolyzes glucosylceramide to glucose and ceramide. Yildiz et
al. (2006) concluded that GBA2 is a glucosylceramidase, the loss of
which causes accumulation of glycolipids and an endoplasmic reticulum
storage disease.

Martin et al. (2013) found that morpholino knockout of Gba2 in zebrafish
induced a curly tail phenotype in 12.5% of morphants, but 73.8% had no
visible abnormalities. However, 24% of those that appeared normal showed
significant motility defects compared to control embryos. These defects
were associated with abnormal development of spinal motoneurons and
defects in axonal outgrowth. Some of these defects could be rescued when
coexpressed with wildtype human GBA2.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 46, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
GBA2, ARG630TRP

In affected members of a large consanguineous Tunisian family with
autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia-46 (SPG46; 614409),
Martin et al. (2013) identified a homozygous 1888C-T transition in exon
12 of the GBA2 gene, resulting in an arg630-to-trp (R630W) substitution
at a highly conserved residue in the six-hairpin-glucosidase-like domain
of the enzyme. The mutation, which segregated with the disorder and was
not found in 1,038 control chromosomes or 6,500 control exomes, was
found by sequencing all coding exons in the region on chromosome 9
identified by linkage analysis (Boukhris et al., 2010). Direct
sequencing of the GBA2 gene in 95 probands with autosomal recessive SPG
identified a homozygous R630W substitution in a Portuguese patient with
the disorder whose parents were related. Each unaffected parent was
heterozygous for the mutation. The mutation-carrying haplotypes differed
between the 2 families. Cells from the Portuguese patient showed a
complete lack of GBA2 activity, and in vitro functional expression
studies showed that the mutant enzyme had no GBA2 activity, consistent
with a complete loss of function. Morpholino knockout of the Gba2 gene
in zebrafish resulted in variable curly tail, motility defects, abnormal
development of spinal motoneurons, and defects in axonal outgrowth.
Coexpression of the R630W mutant protein could not rescue these defects,
although wildtype human GBA2 could rescue the defects.

found in 50 Tunisian controls or in 330 additional controls. The
patients presented in their teenage years with cerebellar ataxia and

;;TOLLOID, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; TLD;;
PROCOLLAGEN C-PROTEINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Bone morphogenetic protein-1/Tolloid is the prototype of a family of
metalloproteases implicated in embryonic patterning in diverse species.
Members of this family contain an astacin-like protease domain and
varying numbers of CUB protein-protein interaction domains and EGF
motifs (Bond and Beynon, 1995).

CLONING

The BMP1 locus encodes a protein that is capable of inducing formation
of cartilage in vivo (Wozney et al., 1988). Although other bone
morphogenetic proteins are members of the TGF-beta (190180) superfamily,
BMP1 encodes a novel protein that is not closely related to other known
growth factors.

In mammals, a single BMP1 gene apparently encodes alternatively spliced
transcript not only for BMP1 but also for a larger protein with a domain
structure identical to that of the Drosophila dorsal-ventral patterning
gene product Tolloid (Tld) (Takahara et al., 1994).

Kessler et al. (1996) showed that recombinantly expressed BMP1 and
purified procollagen C proteinase (PCP), a secreted metalloprotease
requiring calcium and needed for cartilage and bone formation, are, in
fact, identical. PCP cleaves the C-terminal propeptides of procollagen I
(120150), II (120140), and III (120180) and its activity is increased by
the procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer protein (600270). Reddi (1996)
discussed the significance of the finding that BMP1 is the same as
procollagen C-proteinase.

GENE FUNCTION

Amano et al. (2000) found that BMP1 cleaves the laminin-5 (LAMA3;
600805) chain at sites within the G4 subdomain and the IIIa domain and
that BMP1 cleaves the LAMC2 (150292) chain within the second EGF
(131530)-like repeat of domain III. Immunocytochemical analysis showed
that BMP1 is localized to the basal epithelial cell layer in embryonic
bovine skin, supporting the likelihood that BMP1 is involved in
laminin-5 processing in vivo as well as in vitro.

Scott et al. (1999) compared enzymatic activities and expression domains
of 4 mammalian BMP1/TLD-like proteases and found differences in their
ability to process fibrillar collagen precursors and to cleave chordin
(603475). As previously demonstrated for BMP1 and TLD, TLL1 (606742)
specifically processes procollagen C-propeptides at the physiologically
relevant site, whereas TLL2 (606743) lacks this activity. BMP1 and TLL1
cleave chordin, at sites similar to procollagen C-propeptide cleavage
sites, and counteract dorsalizing effects of chordin upon overexpression
on Xenopus embryos. Proteases TLD and TLL2 do not cleave chordin. Scott
et al. (1999) suggested that BMP1 is the major chordin antagonist in
early mammalian embryogenesis and in pre- and postnatal skeletogenesis.

In addition to expression in pituitary and placenta and functions in
growth and reproduction, prolactin (PRL; 176760), growth hormone (GH;
139250), and placental lactogen (CSH1; 150200) are expressed in
endothelial cells and have angiogenic effects. Ge et al. (2007) found
that BMP1 and BMP1-like proteinases processed PRL and GH in vitro and in
vivo to produce approximately 17-kD N-terminal fragments with
antiangiogenic activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Takahara et al. (1995) described the organization of the 46-kb, 22-exon
human BMP1/TLD gene. Exons corresponding to each of the alternatively
spliced transcripts were identified and comparison with the Drosophila
Tld gene revealed alignment of introns at only 3 positions. The major
BMP1/TLD transcription start site was found only 706 bp downstream of
the polyadenylation site of the SFTP2 surfactant gene (178620), and a
previously reported highly polymorphic CA repeat was found within the
BMP1/TLD first intron. These 2 findings placed the BMP1/TLD gene between
markers D8S298 and D8S5 on the genetic map.

MAPPING

Ceci et al. (1990) mapped murine Bmp1 to a region of mouse chromosome 14
close to esterase-10 and the murine homolog of the human RB1 gene
(614041); thus, it was considered possible for the human homolog of Bmp1
to be located on 13q14. However, using cDNA probes in the analysis of
somatic cell hybrid lines, Tabas et al. (1991) demonstrated that the
BMP1 gene maps to chromosome 8. By in situ hybridization, Yoshiura et
al. (1993) mapped the BMP1 gene to 8p21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By genomewide homozygosity mapping in a consanguineous Egyptian family
in which 2 sibs had a severe form of autosomal recessive osteogenesis
imperfecta (OI13; 614856), Martinez-Glez et al. (2012) identified a
region of homozygosity on 8p containing the BMP1 gene. By direct
sequencing of this gene in the proband, they identified homozygosity for
a missense mutation (F249L; 112264.0001). The same mutation was found in
homozygous state in the proband's affected brother and in heterozygous
state in their parents and unaffected sibs.

In 2 affected sibs of a consanguineous family from Turkey with increased
bone mineral density and multiple recurrent fractures, Asharani et al.
(2012) identified homozygosity for a missense mutation (G12R;
112264.0002) in the BMP1 gene. The mutation was identified by combined
whole-exome sequencing and filtering for homozygous stretches of
identified variants.

Yang et al. (2010) reported that holoprosencephaly (HPE; see 236100) in
mice can result from simultaneous reduction in both Nodal (601265)
signaling and expression levels of the Bmp antagonists chordin (CHRD;
603475) or Noggin (NOG; 602991). HPE defects are the result of reduced
production of tissues that promote forebrain and craniofacial
development. Nodal promotes the expression of genes in the anterior
primitive streak important for the development of these tissues, whereas
Bmp inhibits their expression. Pharmacologic and transgenic manipulation
of these signaling pathways suggested that the Bmp and Nodal pathways
antagonize each other prior to intracellular signal transduction. In
vitro experiments indicated that secreted Bmp2 (112261) and Nodal can
form extracellular complexes, potentially interfering with receptor
activation. Yang et al. (2010) concluded that the patterning of
forebrain and medial craniofacial elements requires a fine balance
between BMP and NODAL signaling during primitive streak development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Asharani et al. (2012) characterized a zebrafish bone mutant harboring
lesions in bmp1a, demonstrating conservation of BMP1 function in
osteogenesis across species. Genetic, biochemical, and histologic
analyses of this mutant and a comparison to a second, similar locus
revealed that Bmp1a is critically required for mature-collagen
generation, downstream of osteoblast maturation, in bone.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, TYPE XIII
BMP1, PHE249LEU

In 2 Egyptian children from a consanguineous family with severe
osteogenesis imperfecta and a large umbilical hernia (OI13; 614856),
Martinez-Glez et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 747C-G transversion
in exon 6 of the BMP1 gene, resulting in a phe249-to-leu (F249L)
substitution. Segregation analysis of the mutation within the family
showed that the unaffected sister and brother and parents carried the
mutation in heterozygous state. The mutation was not found in 100
chromosomes from ethnically matched controls or in 884 chromosomes from
European controls.

Martinez-Glez et al. (2012) performed type I procollagen analysis in
supernatants from cultured fibroblasts and demonstrated abnormal PICP
processing in patient-derived cells consistent with the F249L mutation
causing decreased BMP1 function. This was further confirmed by
overexpressing wildtype and mutant BMP1 longer isoform (mammalian
Tolloid protein; mTLD) in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and human primary
fibroblasts. Whereas overproduction of normal mTLD resulted in a large
proportion of pro-alpha-1(I) in the culture media being C-terminally
processed, pro-alpha-1(I) cleavage was not enhanced by an excess of the
mutant protein, proving that the mutation leads to a BMP1/mTLD protein
with deficient PICP proteolytic activity.

.0002
OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, TYPE XIII
BMP1, GLY12ARG

In 2 children from a consanguineous family from Turkey affected by
increased bone mineral density and multiple recurrent fractures (OI13;
614856), Asharani et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 34G-C
transversion in exon 1 of the BMP1 gene, resulting in a gly12-to-arg
(G12R) substitution within the signal peptide; this signal peptide is
essential for the protein's localization to the endoplasmic reticulum,
correct posttranslational glycosylation, and secretion. Asharani et al.
(2012) confirmed in in vitro assays that the mutation leads to severely
reduced posttranslational N-glycosylation of the protein and impairs
protein secretion. They also showed that the mutation leads to both
reduced secretion and subsequent reduced processing of the substrates
chordin and collagen I.

607179	TITLE *607179 RNA-BINDING MOTIF PROTEIN 12; RBM12
;;KIAA0765
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Stover et al. (2001) cloned a partial cDNA encoding a member of the
RNA-binding motif protein family, RBM12, from a human colon carcinoma
cell line cDNA library. They cloned the full-length cDNA from an acute
monocytic leukemia cell line cDNA library and found that it is identical
to a partial cDNA, KIAA0765, isolated from a brain cDNA library by
Nagase et al. (1998). The full-length cDNA encodes a deduced 932-amino
acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 97 kD. It contains 5
RNA-binding motifs, several potential transmembrane domains, and 2
proline-rich regions that coincide with 2 of the transmembrane domains.
The RBM12 protein has a nuclear targeting sequence and a mitochondrial
targeting sequence, but no signal sequence. Northern blot analysis
detected abundant expression of a 3.5-kb transcript in all cell lines
tested.

GENE STRUCTURE

Stover et al. (2001) determined that the RBM12 gene contains 2 exons and
spans approximately 10 kb. The structure of the gene is unusual in that
its 1 intron is located in the 5-prime untranslated region and the
complete coding sequence is transcribed from a single exon. Southern
blot analysis indicated that RBM12 is present in single copy.

MAPPING

By FISH, Stover et al. (2001) mapped the RBM12 gene to chromosome
20q11.2.

611201	TITLE *611201 KELCH-LIKE 9; KLHL9
;;KIAA1354
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned KLHL9, which they designated
KIAA1354. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its 3-prime
end, and the deduced 632-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with the actin-binding protein MAYVEN (KLHL2; 605774). RT-PCR
ELISA detected high KLHL9 expression in ovary and moderate expression in
all other tissues and specific brain regions examined.

Sumara et al. (2007) stated that KLHL9 contains a highly conserved BACK
(BTB and C-terminal Kelch) motif involved in spatially orienting
substrates in CUL3 (603136)-based ubiquitin E3 ligases.

GENE FUNCTION

Sumara et al. (2007) found that KLHL9, KLHL13 (300655), and CUL3
interacted directly in a 370-kD protein complex in HeLa cell lysates.
The CUL3/KLHL9/KLHL13 complex was the minimum unit required for correct
chromosome alignment in metaphase, proper midzone and midbody formation,
and completion of cytokinesis. CUL3/KLHL9/KLHL13 acted as an E3 ligase
and regulated dynamic localization of the chromosomal passenger protein
Aurora B (AURKB; 604970) on mitotic chromosomes and accumulation of
Aurora B on the central spindle after anaphase onset. Aurora B directly
bound the substrate-recognition domains of KLHL9 and KLHL13 in vitro and
coimmunoprecipitated with the CUL3/KLHL9/KLHL13 complex during mitosis.
Moreover, Aurora B was ubiquitylated in a CUL3-dependent manner in vivo
and by reconstituted CUL3/KLHL9/KLHL13 in vitro. Sumara et al. (2007)
concluded that CUL3/KLHL9/KLHL13 is an E3 ligase that controls the
dynamic behavior of Aurora B on mitotic chromosomes and thereby
coordinates faithful mitotic progression and completion of cytokinesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hardy et al. (2004) determined that KLHL9 is an intronless gene that
spans 4.0 to 4.5 kb. It has a CpG island at its 5-prime end.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hardy et al. (2004) mapped the KLHL9 gene
to chromosome 9p21, where it lies near a cluster of interferon genes.
They mapped the mouse Klhl9 gene to a region of chromosome 4C4 that
shares homology of synteny with human chromosome 9p21.

Hartz (2013) mapped the KLHL9 gene to chromosome 9p21.3 based on an
alignment of the KLHL9 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB037775) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

607210	TITLE *607210 CASPASE RECRUITMENT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 11; CARD11
;;CARD-MAGUK PROTEIN 1; CARMA1;;
BCL10-INTERACTING MAGUK PROTEIN 3; BIMP3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CARD11 gene encodes a protein that acts as a scaffold for nuclear
factor kappa-B (NFKB; 164011) activity in the adaptive immune response
controlling peripheral B-cell differentiation and a variety of critical
T-cell effector functions (summary by Stepensky et al., 2013).

The caspase recruitment domain (CARD) is a protein module that consists
of 6 or 7 antiparallel alpha helices. It participates in apoptosis
signaling through highly specific protein-protein homophilic
interactions. CARDs induce nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; 164011)
activity through the IKK (e.g., IKKB, or IKBKB; 603258) complex. CARD9
(607212), CARD10 (607209), CARD11, and CARD14 (607211) interact with
BCL10 (603517) and are involved in NFKB signaling complexes. Except for
CARD9, these CARD proteins are members of the membrane-associated
guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family.

CLONING

By database searching for CARD family members, Bertin et al. (2001)
identified CARD11. The deduced 1,147-amino acid protein contains an
N-terminal CARD domain that is 52% identical to that of CARD14, a
central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal tripartite structure
comprised of a PDZ domain, an SH3 domain, and a GUK domain. Northern
blot analysis revealed expression of a 4.4-kb transcript in thymus,
spleen, liver, and peripheral blood leukocytes. Expression was also
detected in hemopoietic cancer cell lines. In contrast, CARD14
expression was restricted to placenta.

By database searching for CARD proteins with high similarity to, and
therefore a greater likelihood of interacting with, BCL10, Gaide et al.
(2001) identified CARD11, CARD14, and CARD10, which they termed CARMA1,
CARMA2, and CARMA3, respectively. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that
CARD11 colocalizes with BCL10 in perinuclear structures.

GENE FUNCTION

Using luciferase reporter analysis, Bertin et al. (2001) showed that
CARD11 induces NFKB activity through IKKG (IKBKG; 300248) or IKKB and
that this induction requires the N terminus of CARD11. Deletion of the
C-terminal domains of CARD11 resulted in enhanced NFKB activity,
suggesting a negative regulatory function. Mammalian 2-hybrid and
coprecipitation analyses indicated that CARD domains of CARD11 and
CARD14 interact with the CARD of BCL10. Fluorescence microscopy
demonstrated a cytoplasmic colocalization of CARD11 with BCL10.
Functional analysis showed that CARD11 and CARD14 both phosphorylate
BCL10 in a CARD-dependent manner.

Gaide et al. (2002) showed that T-cell receptor (TCR; see 186880)
stimulation induces an association of CARMA1, which is constitutively
associated with lipid rafts, with BCL10, which is recruited from the
cytoplasm, and TCR. A CARD11 mutant unable to bind BCL10 inhibited
TCR-induced NFKB activation and interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) production.

Using somatic mutagenesis, Wang et al. (2002) cloned a CARMA1-deficient
Jurkat T-cell line, which exhibited selectively impaired NFKB activation
and IL2 production. Addition of CARMA1 to the mutant line restored
function and appeared to recruit protein kinase C-theta (PRKCQ; 600448)
to phosphorylate BCL10, possibly at the cell membrane-cytoplasm
interface.

Using mouse Card11 lacking the CARD domain and RNA interference,
Pomerantz et al. (2002) demonstrated that Card11 mediated NFKB
activation by cross-linking of CD3 (see 186790) and CD28 (186760) and by
phorbol ester treatment. However, Card11 was not required for NFKB
activation mediated by TCR induction of NFAT (see 600489) or AP1
(165160) or by exposure to TNFA (191160) or double-stranded RNA. Western
blot analysis indicated that the CARD-deleted mutant blocked NFKB
induction upstream of IKK complex activation, IKBA (164008) degradation,
and nuclear localization of NFKB. Furthermore, CARD11 interacted with
BCL10 in a CARD domain-dependent manner.

Ngo et al. (2006) developed a loss-of-function RNA interference screen
for molecular targets in cancer. Using the newly developed screen in
diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL; see 605027), Ngo et al. (2006)
showed that in activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL cells, but not germinal
center B cell-like DLBCL cells, short hairpin RNAs targeting the
NF-kappa-B (see 164011) pathway were depleted, in keeping with the
essential role of this pathway in the survival of activated B cell-like
DLBCL. This screen uncovered CARD11 as a key upstream signaling
component responsible for constitutive I-kappa-B kinase (see 603258)
activity in activated B cell-like DLBCL.

Using biochemical and genetic approaches, Wegener et al. (2006)
demonstrated that IKKB is critical for regulation of the
CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (604860) (CBM) complex. They found that IKKB is
required not only for initial complex formation, but also for triggering
disengagement of BCL10 and MALT1 by phosphorylation of the C terminus of
BCL10, thereby negatively influencing T-cell receptor signaling. Wegener
et al. (2006) proposed a model in which IKKB is associated with
BCL10-MALT1 in resting T cells. Following T-cell activation, PRKCQ
phosphorylates CARMA1 and induces association of CARMA1 with
BCL10-MALT1. Formation of the BCM complex induces maximal activation of
IKK through activation of IKKG. IKKB phosphorylates BCL10 in its MALT1
interaction domain, causing BCL10 and MALT1 to disassociate, resulting
in attenuation of NFKB signaling and cytokine production.

Medeiros et al. (2007) presented evidence for a previously unrecognized
function for ADAP (602731) in regulating TCR-mediated activation of the
transcription factor NF-kappa-B. Stimulation of ADAP-deficient mouse T
cells with antibodies to CD3 and CD28 resulted in impaired nuclear
translocation of NF-kappa-B, a reduced DNA binding, and delayed
degradation and decreased phosphorylation of I-kappa-B. TCR-stimulated
assembly of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 complex was substantially impaired in
the absence of ADAP. Medeiros et al. (2007) further identified a region
of ADAP that is required for association with the CARMA1 adaptor and
NF-kappa-B activation but is not required for ADAP-dependent regulation
of adhesion.

Bidere et al. (2009) conducted parallel screens involving a mass
spectrometry analysis of CARMA1 binding partners and an RNA interference
screen for growth inhibition of the CBM-dependent ABC subtype of DLBCL.
The authors reported that both screens identified casein kinase 1-alpha
(CK1-alpha; 600505) as a bifunctional regulator of NF-kappa-B. CK1-alpha
dynamically associates with the CBM complex on T-cell-receptor
engagement to participate in cytokine production and lymphocyte
proliferation. However, CK1-alpha kinase activity has a contrasting role
by subsequently promoting the phosphorylation and inactivation of
CARMA1. CK1-alpha has thus a dual 'gating' function which first promotes
and then terminates receptor-induced NF-kappa-B. ABC DLBCL cells
required CK1-alpha for constitutive NF-kappa-B activity, indicating that
CK1-alpha functions as a conditionally essential malignancy gene.

Compagno et al. (2009) showed that greater than 50% of activated B
cell-like (ABC) diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and a smaller
fraction of germinal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL carry somatic
mutations in multiple genes, including negative (TNFAIP3; 191163) and
positive (including CARD11 and TRAF2, 601895) regulators of NF-kappa-B
(see 164011). Of these, the TNFAIP3 gene, which encodes a
ubiquitin-modifying enzyme (A20) involved in termination of NF-kappa-B
responses, is most commonly affected, with approximately 30% of patients
displaying biallelic inactivation by mutations and/or deletions. Less
frequently, missense mutations of TRAF2 and CARD11 produce molecules
with significantly enhanced ability to activate NF-kappa-B. Compagno et
al. (2009) concluded that NF-kappa-B activation in DLBCL is caused by
genetic lesions affecting multiple genes, the loss or activation of
which may promote lymphomagenesis by leading to abnormally prolonged
NF-kappa-B responses.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CARD11
gene to chromosome 7 (TMAP stSG31669).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Somatic Mutations

Lenz et al. (2008) sequenced the CARD11 gene in human diffuse large B
cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tumors, a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (see
605027). They detected somatic missense mutations in 7 of 73 activated B
cell-like (ABC) DLBCL biopsies (9.6%), all within exons encoding the
coiled-coil domain. Experimental introduction of CARD11 coiled-coil
domain mutants into lymphoma cell lines resulted in constitutive
NF-kappa-B activation and enhanced NF-kappa-B activity upon antigen
receptor stimulation. Lenz et al. (2008) concluded that CARD11 is a bona
fide oncogene in DLBCL, providing a genetic rationale for the
development of pharmacologic inhibitors of the CARD11 pathway for DLBCL
therapy.

- Germline Mutations

In a man and his 2 daughters with persistent polyclonal B-cell
lymphocytosis (PPBL; 606445), Snow et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous germline mutation in the CARD11 gene (E127G; 607210.0001).
The mutation was found by massively parallel mRNA sequencing and
searching for shared mutations in the B-cell transcriptome. The patients
presented in infancy with enlarged lymph nodes, splenomegaly, and B-cell
lymphocytosis associated with mild immune dysregulation, including some
defective antibody production and T-cell anergy. An unrelated child with
a similar condition and a heterozygous mutation in CARD11 was also
identified (G116S; 607210.0002); this mutation was previously found by
Lenz et al. (2008) as a somatic mutation in a B-cell lymphoma. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that both mutations resulted in
constitutive NFKB activation, consistent with a gain of function. The
mutant proteins spontaneously localized into large protein aggregates
that also stained with BCL10 and MALT1. The increase in numbers of B
cells appeared to result from increased B-cell output from the bone
marrow, rather than from increased survival or proliferation in the
periphery. The father in the first family developed B-cell chronic
lymphocytic leukemia associated with a 13q14 deletion (CLLS2; 109543) in
leukemic cells, which likely contributed to oncogenesis, but Snow et al.
(2012) also suggested that PPBL may predispose to the development of a
B-cell malignancy.

In a girl, born of consanguineous parents of central European descent,
with immunodeficiency-11 (IMD11; 615206), Greil et al. (2013) identified
a homozygous truncating mutation in the CARD11 gene (607210.0003).
Stepensky et al. (2013) reported another patient with immunodeficiency
who was homozygous for a truncating CARD11 mutation (607210.0004). Both
mutations were identified by exome sequencing. Both patients developed
pneumonia due to Pneumocystis jirovecii infection and underwent
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Laboratory studies showed
normal numbers of B and T cells, but increased numbers of transitional B
cells and decreased regulatory T cells, indicating a differentiation
defect. In vitro functional expression studies showed defective NFKB
signaling in lymphocytes upon activation. The reports indicated an
important role for the CARD11 scaffold protein in linking TCR and BCR
signaling with NFKB activation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hara et al. (2003) generated Card11 -/- mice, which were healthy and
fertile, by targeting exon 4 and part of exon 5. Flow cytometric
analysis showed that, apart from certain B-cell subpopulations and
natural killer (NK) cells, B-cell numbers were normal and T-cell
development proceeded normally in Card11 -/- mice. However, Card11 -/-
lymphocytes were defective in assays of T- and B-cell activation, and
Card11 -/- mice failed to produce specific antibody. FACS and EMSA
analyses demonstrated that Card11 was essential for antigen receptor-
and protein kinase C-mediated proliferation and cytokine production,
with loss of Card11 resulting in a selective defect in Jnk (601158) and
Nfkb activation. B-cell proliferation and Jnk activation were also
impaired after lipopolysaccharide stimulation of Tlr4 (603030),
suggesting that CARD11 is involved in both innate and adaptive immune
responses. Hara et al. (2003) concluded that MAGUK proteins are critical
regulators of neuronal synapses and immune receptor signaling.

Jun et al. (2003) treated male mice with the chemical mutagen
ethylnitrosourea and used their male progeny as founders of inbreeding
pedigrees. Several mice in one of these pedigrees exhibited high levels
of surface IgM on circulating IgD-positive B cells. Because surface IgM
is normally modulated to lower levels on many mature recirculating B
cells, relative to transitional B cells, the authors named the mutant
strain 'unmodulated.' Jun et al. (2003) identified a leu298-to-gln
substitution in Carma1, which was predicted to disrupt coiled-coil
domain structure and to interfere with protein pairing, as the
unmodulated mutation. Serum IgG3 levels were reduced in unmodulated
mice, suggesting an interference with Th1 rather than Th2 antibody
responses. Unmodulated mice had selective defects in B-cell activation,
with impairment of Nfkb and Jnk activation, and they gradually developed
atopic dermatitis with high levels of IgE. Jun et al. (2003) concluded
that CARMA1 is a key regulator of plasticity in antigen receptor
signaling.

PERSISTENT POLYCLONAL B-CELL LYMPHOCYTOSIS
CARD11, GLU127GLY

In a man and his 2 daughters with persistent polyclonal B-cell
lymphocytosis (PPBL; 606445), Snow et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous germline c.735G-A transition in exon 5 of the CARD11 gene,
resulting in a glu127-to-gly (E127G) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in the N-terminal portion of the CC domain. The mutation, which
was found by massively parallel mRNA sequencing and searching for shared
mutations in the B-cell transcriptome, was not found in unaffected
family members or in 100 control individuals. Ectopic expression of
E127G CARD11 in B cells showed that it localized into large protein
aggregates, in contrast to dispersed cytoplasmic distribution of the
wildtype protein. The aggregates stained with BCL10 (603517) and MALT1
(604860), 2 signaling partners required for NFKB (164011) activation.
These findings suggested spontaneous multimerization of the mutant
protein. Transfection of E127G into CARD11-null T cells resulted in
constitutive NFKB activation, consistent with a gain of function. In
addition, patient B cells showed selective upregulation of
NFKB-dependent genes and showed impaired differentiation with decreased
antibody production. Patient T cells showed decreased proliferation and
activation upon stimulation, suggesting mild anergy of the T-cell line.
The increase in numbers of B cells appeared to result from increased
B-cell output from the bone marrow, rather than from increased survival
or proliferation in the periphery.

PERSISTENT POLYCLONAL B-CELL LYMPHOCYTOSIS
CARD11, GLY116SER

In a Chinese girl with polyclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (606445), Snow et
al. (2012) identified a heterozygous germline G-to-A transition in exon
4 of the CARD11 gene, resulting in a gly16-to-ser (G116S) substitution
at the N-terminal end of the CC domain. This mutation had previously
been described as a somatic gain-of-function mutation in a diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (Lenz et al., 2008). The mutant protein showed
spontaneous aggregation and colocalization with activating signaling
partners.

IMMUNODEFICIENCY 11
CARD11, GLN945TER

In a girl, born of consanguineous parents of central European descent,
with immunodeficiency-11 (IMD11; 615206), Greil et al. (2013) identified
a homozygous c.2833C-T transition in the CARD11 gene, resulting in a
gln945-to-ter (Q945X) substitution and a protein missing the guanylate
kinase-like domain. The mutation, which was identified by exome
sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, segregated with the
disorder in the family and was not found in several large control
databases. Analysis of patient cells showed that the mutant transcript
was not subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the mutant protein did not activate NFKB
(164011), consistent with a loss of function. The patient presented at 6
months of age with interstitial pneumonia due to P. jirovecii infection
and was found to be severely immunodeficient. Although laboratory
studies showed normal numbers of T and B cells, she had
agammaglobulinemia. Immunophenotyping of both T and B cells showed naive
or transitional populations and severely decreased numbers of regulatory
T cells. There was impaired proliferation in response to T-cell mitogens
and decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines after LPS
stimulation. The findings suggested a severe impairment of TCR-mediated
T-lymphocyte function. The patient underwent successful hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation.

IMMUNODEFICIENCY 11
CARD11, 1,377-BP DEL

In a girl, born of consanguineous parents of Palestinian descent, with
immunodeficiency-11 (615206), Stepensky et al. (2013) identified a
homozygous 1,377-bp genomic deletion in the CARD11 gene, resulting in
the deletion of exon 21. The deletion was flanked by a stretch of 36
identical basepairs. The mutation, which was identified by exome
sequencing and Sanger sequencing, was present in heterozygosity in each
of the unaffected parents. No protein could be detected in patient
cells, indicating a complete loss of protein expression. The patient
presented in infancy with recurrent respiratory infections and later
developed P. jirovecii pneumonia. Two sibs had died in infancy with
recurrent infections. Laboratory studies of the proband showed
hypogammaglobulinemia with normal numbers of B and T cells. Flow
cytometric studies showed decreased numbers of regulatory T cells and
reduced numbers of differentiated T cells compared to naive cells. B
cells were predominantly transitional cells, with decreased numbers of
differentiated B cells. Patient lymphocytes showed defective NFKB
signaling upon activation. The abrogated activation of the canonical
NFKB pathway was associated with severely impaired upregulation of
inducible T-cell costimulator (604558), OX40 (600315), cytokine
production, T-cell proliferation, and B cell-activating factor receptor
expression on B cells. The patient underwent successful bone marrow
transplantation.

300841	TITLE *300841 COAGULATION FACTOR VIII; F8
;;FACTOR VIII;;
COAGULATION FACTOR VIIIC, PROCOAGULANT COMPONENT; F8C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The F8 gene encodes coagulation factor VIII, a large plasma glycoprotein
that functions in the blood coagulation cascade as a cofactor for the
factor IXa (300746)-dependent activation of factor X (F10; 613872).
Factor VIII is activated proteolytically by a variety of coagulation
enzymes, including thrombin (F2; 176930). Factor VIII is tightly
associated in the blood with von Willebrand factor (VWF; 613160), which
serves as a protective carrier protein for factor VIII (summary by Toole
et al., 1984; review by Hoyer, 1994).

CLONING

Fay et al. (1982) isolated a highly purified human factor VIII that
consisted of a single high molecular weight polypeptide chain having the
highest specific activity.

Toole et al. (1984) isolated clones corresponding to the F8 gene from a
human cDNA library. Independently and simultaneously, Gitschier et al.
(1984) and Wood et al. (1984) also cloned and expressed the F8 gene. The
deduced precursor protein has 2,351 amino acids and a molecular mass of
267 kD. The leader sequence of the proprotein contains 19 amino acids,
yielding a mature protein of 2,332 amino acids. The protein has an
obvious domain structure, contains sequence repeats, and is structurally
related to factor V (F5; 612309) and ceruloplasmin (CP; 117700). F8 has
3 copies of an A domain of 330 to 380 amino acids, a B domain of about
925 amino acids, and 2 C domains of about 160 amino acids. The domains
are arranged A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. Both A and C repeats show conservation of
cysteines, and the B region contains most potential N-glycosylation
sites. Northern blot analysis detected a 9-kb F8 transcript.

The F8 gene is expressed in human liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and a
variety of other tissues, but not in bone marrow, peripheral blood
lymphocytes, or endothelial cells (Wion et al., 1985).

GENE STRUCTURE

The F8 gene contains 26 exons and spans 186 kb (Gitschier et al., 1984).

Levinson et al. (1990) found a curious example of a gene within a gene.
In looking for transcripts from the Xq28 region, they found one referred
to as the A gene that hybridized to a region in exon 22 of the F8 gene.
The A or F8A gene (305423) was in reverse orientation to F8 and was
contained entirely in intron 22. Computer analysis of the sequence
suggested that the A gene encodes a protein, with the complication that
codon usage analysis suggested a frameshift halfway through the gene.
The A gene cDNA also bound to mouse, monkey, and rat genomic DNA in a
'zoo blot.' The mouse A gene was also found to be on the X chromosome
but not within the mouse F8 gene as it is in the human.

Freije and Schlessinger (1992) demonstrated that the X chromosome
contains 3 copies of F8A and its adjacent regions, 1 in intron 22 and 2
telomeric and upstream to the F8 gene transcription start site. Gene
F8A, which is transcribed in the opposite direction to F8, is intronless
and completely nested within intron 22. Approximately 500 kb upstream of
the F8 gene, there are 2 additional transcribed copies of the F8A gene.
Lakich et al. (1993) pointed out that intron 22 is unusual in many
respects. At 32 kb, it is the largest intron in the F8 gene. It also
contains a CpG island, located about 10 kb downstream of exon 22. This
island appears to serve as a bidirectional promoter for the F8A and F8B
(305424) genes. The F8B gene is also located in intron 22 and is
transcribed in the opposite direction from F8A; its first exon lies
within intron 22 and is spliced to exons 23-26. The F8A and B genes are
both expressed ubiquitously.

Having previously reported the existence of 5 CpG islands close to the
F8 gene, 4 of which they cloned by genomic walking, Gitschier's group
(Kenwrick et al., 1992) reported the isolation of the remaining island,
located approximately 70 kb telomeric of the 5-prime end of the F8 gene.
They identified cDNA clones corresponding to 2 transcribed sequences,
C6.1A (BRCC3; 300617) and C6.1B (MTCP1; 300116), that originate from
this CpG island. The C6.1A gene was highly conserved between species and
expressed abundantly in many human and mouse tissues. No striking
homologies to existing genes could be found for either sequence.
Kenwrick et al. (1992) found that both genes were deleted in 2 brothers
who suffered from mental handicap and dysmorphism as well as hemophilia
A (306700).

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Tantravahi et al. (1986) concluded that the F8
gene is located in the proximal part of chromosome Xq28 with probes DX13
and St14 distally located. Using a hybrid cell line that contains only a
terminal Xq28 fragment, Tantravahi et al. (1986) found that F8 probes
did not hybridize but the DX13 and St14 did hybridize to the DNA of that
cell line.

Patterson et al. (1987) showed that the G6PD (305900) and F8 genes lie
within 500 kb of each other. Arveiler et al. (1989) showed that G6PD and
F8 are in the same 290-kb pulsed field gel electrophoresis fragment, but
did not establish which of the genes is more proximal.

Kenwrick and Gitschier (1989) established the order:
cen--R/GCP--GDX--G6PD--F8--DXS15--tel. The direction of transcription of
the GDX, G6PD, and F8 genes is toward the centromere, i.e., the R/GCP
end of the region. Patterson et al. (1989) showed that the genomic
sequences recognized by the anonymous probe 767 (DXS115) are localized
to 2 sites within Xq28. One site lies within intron 22 of the F8 gene.
The second site, which contains the RFLPs detected by 767, is located
within 1.2 megabases of the F8 gene. Genetic data indicate tight linkage
of F8 and DXS115; maximum lod = 8.30 at theta = 0.04.

G6PD (305900) is one of the 5 rather tightly linked loci located on
Xq28, the others being CBD (303800), CBP (303900), HEMA, and ALD
(300371). In a physical map of the most distal 12 Mb of Xq, Poustka et
al. (1991) found that the F8 gene lies about 1.1 Mb from the telomere,
with G6PD proximal to it, and about 1.5 Mb from the telomere. This
contradicted the earlier impression that the gene is located in the
proximal part of Xq28.

In a 9-year-old Malaysian female with de novo hemophilia A (306700) as
well as a complex de novo translocation involving one X chromosome and
one chromosome 17 (Muneer et al., 1986), Migeon et al. (1993) identified
a breakpoint within Xq28 with deletion of the 5-prime end of the factor
VIII gene, leaving the more proximal G6PD locus intact on the derivative
chromosome 17. As the deleted segment included the 5-prime half of F8C
as well as the subtelomeric DXYS64 locus, they concluded that F8 is
oriented on the chromosome with its 5-prime region closest to the
telomere.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Factor VII is a complex of a large inert carrier protein (VWF; 613160)
and a noncovalently bound small fragment which contains the procoagulant
active site. Zacharski et al. (1968) showed that leukocytes synthesize
some factor VIII in vitro; however, it is synthesized primarily in the
liver.

Cooper and Wagner (1974) presented evidence that the carrier molecule is
normally present in the plasma of hemophilia A patients and

Fay et al. (1982) isolated a highly purified human factor VIII that
consisted of a single high molecular weight polypeptide chain having the
highest specific activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ratnoff and Bennett (1973) reviewed the genetics of hereditary disorders
of blood coagulation.

Gitschier et al. (1985) identified truncating mutations in the F8 gene
(see, e.g., 300841.0001-300841.0003) as the basis for hemophilia A
(306700). A severe hemophiliac with no detectable factor VIIIC activity
had an R2307X mutation (300841.0001). Gitschier et al. (1986) found that
the same codon was converted to glutamine (R2307Q; 300841.0042) in a
mild hemophiliac with 10% of normal activity. A diminished level of
factor VIII Ag in the latter patient coincided with the level of
clotting activity, suggesting that the abnormal factor VIII was
relatively unstable.

In a study of 83 patients with hemophilia A, Youssoufian et al. (1986)
identified 2 different point mutations, one in exon 18 and one in exon
22, that recurred independently in unrelated families. Each mutation
produced a nonsense codon by a change of CG to TG. In the opinion of
Youssoufian et al. (1986), these observations indicated that CpG
dinucleotides are mutation hotspots. It had been postulated that
methylated cytosines may be mutation hotspots because 5-methylcytosine
can spontaneously deaminate to thymine, resulting in a C-to-T transition
in DNA.

Youssoufian et al. (1987) characterized 5 different partial deletions of
the F8 gene in 83 patients with hemophilia. None had developed
circulating inhibitors. One of the deletions occurred de novo in a germ
cell of the maternal grandmother, while a second deletion occurred in a
germ cell of a maternal grandfather. The findings indicated that de novo
deletions of X-linked genes can occur in either male or female gametes.
Youssoufian et al. (1988) reported 6 other partial F8 gene deletions in
severe hemophilia A, bringing to 12 the number of deletions among 240
patients. No association was observed between the size or location of
deletions and the presence of inhibitors to factor VIII. Furthermore, no
'hotspots' for deletion breakpoints were identified.

Youssoufian et al. (1988) screened 240 patients with hemophilia A and
found CG to TG transitions in an exon in 9. They identified novel
missense mutations leading to severe hemophilia A and estimated that the
extent of hypermutability of CpG dinucleotides is 10 to 20 times greater
than the average mutation rate for hemophilia A.

Cooper and Youssoufian (1988) collated reports of single basepair
mutations within gene coding regions causing human genetic disease. They
found that 35% of mutations occurred within CpG dinucleotides. Over 90%
of these mutations were C-to-T or G-to-A transitions, which thus occur
within coding regions at a frequency 42-times higher than that predicted
from random mutation. Cooper and Youssoufian (1988) believed these
findings were consistent with methylation-induced deamination of
5-methylcytosine and suggested that methylation of DNA within coding
regions may contribute significantly to the incidence of human genetic
disease.

Higuchi et al. (1988) found deletion of about 2,000 bases spanning exon
3 and part of IVS3 of the F8 gene in a patient with severe hemophilia A.
The mother was judged to be a somatic mosaic because the defective gene
could be identified in only a portion of the leukocytes and cultured
fibroblasts.

By use of a cDNA probe corresponding to exons 14-26 of F8, Bardoni et
al. (1988) studied 49 Italian patients with severe hemophilia A. They
found no TaqI site mutations, but did find a partial deletion,
eliminating exons 15-18 and spanning about 13 kb (300841.0046), in a
patient with anti-factor VIII antibodies.

In a case of hemophilia A, Kazazian et al. (1988) described the first
instance of insertional mutagenesis in man caused by a long inserted
element (LINE) in the F8 gene. L1 (LINE-1) sequences are a
human-specific family of long, interspersed, repetitive elements,
present in about 100,000 copies dispersed throughout the genome. The
full-length L1 sequence is 6.1 kilobases, but most L1 elements are
truncated at the 5-prime end, resulting in a 5-fold higher copy number
of 3-prime sequences. Kazazian et al. (1988) found insertions of L1
elements into exon 14 of the F8 gene in 2 of 240 unrelated patients with
hemophilia A. Both of these insertions (3.8 and 2.3 kb, respectively)
contained 3-prime portions of the L1 sequence. They interpreted these
results as indicating that certain L1 sequences in man can be dispersed,
presumably by an RNA intermediate, and cause disease by insertional
mutation. Both of the above insertions were de novo events, appearing
either during embryogenesis in the patient or in the mother's germ
cells. The L1 element transposed into one of these patients was
demonstrated by Dombroski et al. (1991) to have come from a
retrotransposable element located on chromosome 22 (see 151626).

Woods-Samuels et al. (1989) characterized a third L1 insertion in intron
10 of the F8 gene of a hemophilia A patient. This L1 insertion was not a
cause of hemophilia in the patient because it was also present in the
maternal grandfather, who did not have the disease. Altogether the L1
insertion was present in 4 generations of the family. All 3 of the L1
insertions discovered by Dombroski et al. (1991) have open reading
frames (ORFs), and the 3 derived amino acid sequences are 98 to 99%
identical. They show similarity in the sequence of the L1 3-prime ORFs,
and the polymerase domain of reverse transcriptase was observed in all 3
L1 insertions. The presence of ORFs and the close sequence similarity of
these recently inserted L1 elements provide indirect evidence for the
existence of a set of functional L1 elements that encodes 1 or more
proteins necessary for their retrotransposition.

In studies of 83 unrelated Finnish patients with hemophilia A, Levinson
et al. (1990) identified specific mutations, falling into 3 classes, in
10 patients: 5 mutations caused loss of TaqI restriction sites; 1 point
mutation resulted in a new TaqI site; and 4 represented partial gene
deletions. Although exons 5 and 6 were involved in 3 of the 4 partial
gene deletions, the extent of the DNA loss differed in each. The fourth
deletion was located entirely within intron 1. There was no history of
hemophilia in 8 of the 10 families. The origin of the mutation was
determined in 6 of these pedigrees, 2 of which showed evidence for
maternal mosaicism.

Brocker-Vriends et al. (1990) described a case of hemophilia A due to
partial deletion of the F8 gene of about 2 kb, spanning exon 5 and part
of introns 4 and 5; the mother was a somatic and presumably gonadal
mosaic for the mutation although coagulation assays and RFLP analysis in
the family did not suggest a carrier status.

McGinniss et al. (1993) reported that half of hemophilia A patients have
no detectable factor VIII; about 5% have normal levels of dysfunctional
factor VIII as protein and are termed CRM-+, whereas the rest ( 45%)
have plasma factor VIII Ag protein reduced to an extent roughly
comparable to the level of factor VIIIC activity and are designated
CRM-reduced. They found in an analysis of mutations that almost all
CRM-positive/reduced mutations (24/26) were missense, and many (12/26)
occurred at CpG dinucleotides. They showed that 18 of 19 amino acid
residues altered by mutation in these patients were conserved in the
porcine and murine sequences. Almost half of the mutations (11/26) were
clustered in the A2 domain.

In a review, Antonarakis et al. (1995) collected the findings of more
than 1,000 hemophilia subjects examined for F8 gene mutations. These
include point mutations, inversions, deletions, and unidentified
mutations which constitute 46%, 42%, 8%, 4%, and 91%, 0%, 0%, and 9%,
respectively, of those with severe versus mild to moderate disease,
respectively, in selected studies. The 266 point mutations described as
of April, 1994 comprised missense (53%), CpG-to-TpG (16%), small
deletions (12%), nonsense (9%), small inversions and splicing (3% each),
and missense polymorphisms and silent mutations in exons (2% each). In
addition to these point mutations 100 different larger deletions and 9
insertion mutations had been reported.

In a study of 147 sporadic cases of severe hemophilia A, Becker et al.
(1996) were able to identify the causative defect in the F8 gene in 126
patients (85.7%). An inversion of the gene was found in 55 patients
(37.4%), a point mutation in 47 (32%), a small deletion in 14 (9.5%), a
large deletion in 8 (5.4%), and a small insertion in 2 (1.4%). In 4
(2.7%), mutations were localized but not yet sequenced. No mutation was
identified in 17 patients (11.6%). The identified mutations occurred in
the B domain in 16 (10.9%); 4 of these were located in an adenosine
nucleotide stretch at codon 1192, indicating a mutation hotspot. Somatic
mosaicism was detected in 3 (3.9%) of 76 patients' mothers, comprising 3
of 16 de novo mutations in the patients' mothers. Investigation of
family relatives allowed detection of a de novo mutation in 16 of 76
2-generation and 28 of 34 3-generation families. On the basis of these
data, Becker et al. (1996) estimated the male:female ratio of mutation
frequencies (k) to be 3.6. By use of the quotients of mutation origin in
maternal grandfather to patients' mother or to maternal grandmother, k
values were directly estimated as 15 and 7.5, respectively. Considering
each mutation type separately, they found a mutation type-specific sex
ratio of mutation frequencies. Point mutations showed a
5-to-10-fold-higher and inversions a more than 10-fold-higher mutation
rate in male germ cells, whereas deletions showed a more than
5-fold-higher mutation rate in female germ cells. Consequently, and in
accordance with the data of other disorders such as Duchenne muscular
dystrophy, the results indicated to Becker et al. (1996) that at least
for X-chromosomal disorders the male:female mutation rate is determined
by its proportion of the different mutation types.

The molecular diagnosis of hemophilia A is challenging because of the
high number of different causative mutations that are distributed
through the large F8 gene. The putative role of the novel mutations,
especially missense mutations, may be difficult to interpret as causing
hemophilia A. Guillet et al. (2006) identified 95 novel mutations out of
180 different mutations found among 515 patients with hemophilia A from
406 unrelated families followed up at a single hemophilia treatment
center in a Paris hospital. The 95 novel mutations comprised 55 missense
mutations, 12 nonsense mutations, 11 splice site mutations, and 17 small
insertions/deletions. They used a strategy in interpreting the causality
of novel F8 mutations based on a combination of the familial segregation
of the mutation, the resulting biologic and clinical hemophilia A
phenotype, and the molecular consequences of the amino acid
substitution. For the latter, they studied the putative biochemical
modifications: its conservation status with cross-species factor VIII
and homologous proteins, its putative location in known factor VIII
functional regions, and its spatial position in the available factor
VIII 3D structures.

Among 1,410 Italian patients with hemophilia A, Santacroce et al. (2008)
identified 382 different mutations in the F8 gene, 217 (57%) of which
had not previously been reported. Mutations leading to a null allele
accounted for 82%, 15%, and less than 1% of severe, moderate, or mild
hemophilia, respectively. Missense mutations were identified in 16%,
68%, and 81% of severe, moderate, or mild hemophilia, respectively,
yielding a good genotype/phenotype correlation useful for treatment and
genetic counseling.

In order to establish a national database of F8 mutations, Green et al.
(2008) identified and cataloged multiple mutations in approximately
one-third of the U.K. hemophilia A population. The risk of developing
inhibitors for patients with nonsense mutations was greater when the
stop codon was in the 3-prime half of the mRNA. The most common change
was the intron 22 inversion (300841.0067), which accounted for 16.6% of
all mutations and for 38% of those causing severe disease.

- Inversion Mutations in Intron 22 of the F8 Gene

Intron 22 of the human F8 gene is hypomethylated on the active X and
methylated on the inactive X. Inaba et al. (1990) described an MspI RFLP
in intron 22 of the F8 gene. Japanese showed 45% heterozygosity and
Asian Indians showed 13%; polymorphism was not found in American blacks
or Caucasians.

Naylor et al. (1992) found an unusual cluster of mutations involving
regions of intron 22 not examined earlier and leading to defective
joining of exons 22 and 23 in the mRNA (300841.0067) as the cause of
hemophilia A in 10 of 24 severely affected UK patients. These results
confirmed predictions about the efficacy of the mRNA-based method
suggested by Naylor et al. (1991), and also excluded hypotheses
proposing that mutations outside the F8 gene are responsible for a large
proportion of severe hemophilia A.

Of the 28 patients reported by Naylor et al. (1993), 5 had mild or
moderate disease and all had a missense mutation. The other 23 patients
were severely affected; unexpectedly, intron 22 seemed to be the target
of approximately 40% of the mutations causing severe hemophilia A.
Naylor et al. (1993) found that the basis of the unique F8 mRNA defect
that prevented PCR amplification across the boundary between exons 22
and 23 was an abnormality in the internal regions of intron 22. They
showed that exons 1-22 of the F8 mRNA had become part of a hybrid
message containing new multi-exonic sequences expressed in normal cells.
The novel sequences were not located in a YAC containing the whole F8
gene. Southern blots from patients probed by novel sequences and clones
covering intron 22 showed no obvious abnormalities. Naylor et al. (1993)
also suggested that inversions involving intron 22 repeated sequences
are the basis of the mRNA defect. These mutations in severely affected
patients occur at the surprising rate of approximately 4 x 10(-6) per
gene per gamete per generation. Furthermore, it has been shown that
these de novo inversions occur more frequently in males than females
with a ratio of 302:1 estimated in male:female germ cells.

The F8A gene (305423) is contained entirely within intron 22 of the F8
gene and is transcript in the reverse orientation from the F8 gene
(Levinson et al., 1990). Lakich et al. (1993) proposed that many of the
previously unidentified mutations resulting in severe hemophilia A are
based on recombination between the homologous F8A sequences within
intron 22 and upstream of the F8 gene. Such a recombination would lead
to an inversion of all intervening DNA and a disruption of the gene.
Lakich et al. (1993) presented evidence to support this model and
described a Southern blot assay that detects the inversion. They
suggested that this assay should permit genetic prediction of hemophilia
A in approximately 45% of families with severe disease.

Rossiter et al. (1994) hypothesized that pairing of Xq with its homolog
inhibits the intrachromosomal inversion that is responsible for nearly
half of all cases of severe hemophilia A. This would predict that the
event originates predominantly in male germ cells. They presented
findings supporting the hypothesis: in all 20 informative cases in which
the inversion originated in a maternal grandparent, DNA polymorphism
analysis determined that it occurred in the male germline. In addition,
all but 1 of 50 mothers of sporadic cases due to an inversion were
carriers.

Inversion mutations resulting from recombinations between DNA sequences
in the A gene in intron 22 of the F8 gene and 1 of 2 other A genes
upstream to F8 have been shown to cause a large portion of cases. From
data on more than 2,000 samples, Antonarakis et al. (1995) concluded
that the common inversion mutations are found in 42% of all severe
hemophilia A subjects. Whereas 98% of the mothers of those with
inversions were carriers of the inversion, only about 1 de novo
inversion was found in maternal cells for every 25 mothers of sporadic
cases. When the maternal grandparental origin of inversions was examined
the ratio of de novo occurrences in male:female germ cells was 69:1.

Brinke et al. (1996) reported the presence of a novel inversion in 2
hemophilic monozygotic twins. These patients showed an inversion that
affects the first intron of the F8 gene, displacing the most telomeric
exon (exon 1) of F8 further towards the telomere and close to the C6.1A
gene (BRCC3; 300617). Brinke et al. (1996) noted that this novel
inversion creates 2 hybrid transcription units. One of these is formed
by the promoter and first exon of F8 and widely expressed sequences that
map telomeric to the C6.1A sequence. The other hybrid transcription unit
contains the CpG island and all of the known sequence of C6.1A and the
3-prime section of most of the F8 gene.

It is hypothesized that the inversion mutations occur almost exclusively
in germ cells during meiotic cell division by an intrachromosomal
recombination between a 9.6-kb sequence within intron 22 and 1 of 2
almost identical copies located about 300 kb distal to the F8 gene at
the telomeric end of the X chromosome. Most inversion mutations
originate in male germ cells, where the lack of bivalent formation may
facilitate flipping of the telomeric end of the single X chromosome.
Oldenburg et al. (2000) reported the first instance of intron 22
inversion presenting as somatic mosaicism in a female, affecting only
about 50% of lymphocyte and fibroblast cells of the proposita. Supposing
a postzygotic de novo mutation as the usual cause of somatic mosaicism,
the finding implies that the intron 22 inversion mutation is not
restricted to meiotic cell divisions but can also occur during mitotic
cell divisions, either in germ cell precursors or in somatic cells.

- Hemophilia A with Inhibitors

Approximately 10 to 20% of patients with severe hemophilia A develop
antibodies, known as inhibitors, to factor VIII following treatment with
with exogenous factor VIII. Most of these patients have nonsense
mutations or deletions in the F8 gene (Antonarakis et al., 1995).

Antonarakis et al. (1985) identified several molecular defects in
families with hemophilia A. One family had a deletion of about 80 kb in
the F8 gene, whereas another had a single nucleotide change in the
coding region of the gene, resulting in a nonsense codon and premature
termination. In addition, they used 2 common polymorphic sites in the F8
gene to differentiate the normal gene from the defective gene in 4 of 6
obligate carriers from families with patients in whom inhibitors did not
develop. In both the family with a large deletion and the family with
premature termination, affected persons developed inhibitors.

A variety of F8 gene mutations have been found in patients with
hemophilia A due to inhibitors. Among 30 such cases, Antonarakis et al.
(1995) found that 87 and 13% had different nonsense and missense
mutations, respectively. F8 gene inversions do not seem to be a major
predisposing factor for the development of inhibitors. Among severe
hemophilia A cases, 16% of those without inversions and 20% of those
with inversions developed inhibitors.

Schwaab et al. (1995) found that the probability of developing factor
VIII inhibitors is greater in patients with large deletions in the F8
gene.

Viel et al. (2009) sequenced the F8 gene in 78 black patients with
hemophilia to identify the causative mutations and background
haplotypes, which the authors designated H1 to H5. They found that 24%
of the patients had an H3 or H4 haplotype, and that the prevalence of
inhibitors was higher among patients with either of those haplotypes
than among patients with haplotypes H1 or H2 (odds ratio, 3.6; p =
0.04), despite a similar spectrum of hemophilic mutations and degree of
severity of illness in the 2 subgroups. Noting that Caucasians carry
only the H1 or H2 haplotypes and that most blood donors are Caucasian,
Viel et al. (2009) suggested that mismatched factor VIII replacement
therapy might be a risk factor for the development of anti-factor VIII
alloantibodies.

- Mutation Detection Methods

Levinson et al. (1987) used RNAse A cleavage and DNA sequencing of the
altered region to identify a mutation in the F8 gene in a case of
hemophilia. The mutation identified by Levinson et al. (1987) was a
novel G-to-C transversion which resulted in a missense mutation, with
proline being substituted for arginine in one of the active domains of
the factor VIII molecule.

Since point mutations in the F8 gene are responsible for most cases of
hemophilia A and only a small proportion of these mutations could be
recognized by restriction endonuclease analysis, Traystman et al. (1990)
used PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to
characterize single nucleotide substitutions. A GC clamp was attached to
the 5-prime PCR primer to allow detection of most single base changes in
DNA fragments ranging in size from 249 to 356 bp. (A 'GC clamp' is a
sequence rich in G and C such that it is relatively resistant to melting
by heating; see Myers et al., 1985, 1985 and Abrams et al., 1990.) Ten
of 11 known point mutations were definitively separated. Traystman et
al. (1990) then used these methods, applied to exon 8, the 3-prime end
of exon 14, exon 17, exon 18, and exon 24, in a study of 52 patients
with unknown mutations. A 'new' disease-producing mutation was found in
2 of the patients: a missense mutation in exon 14 (tyr1709-to-cys and
asn1922-to-asp). A previously described mutation in exon 24
(arg2209-to-gln) In addition, a new polymorphic nucleotide substitution
was found in intron 7. Traystman et al. (1990) detected all of these
mutations when the GC-clamped products from all 5 regions were run in
the same denaturing gel.

Kogan and Gitschier (1990) likewise used DGGE to identify mutations and
found a DNA polymorphism, located in intron 7, which they thought might
be useful for genetic prediction in cases in which the BclI and XbaI
polymorphisms are uninformative.

Higuchi et al. (1991) pointed out that whereas nearly all mutations
resulting in mild to moderate hemophilia B could be detected by PCR and
denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), these methods sufficed
in only 16 of 30 (53%) patients with severe hemophilia A. They
interpreted this to indicate that the mutations in DNA sequence lay
outside the regions studied and may include locus-controlling regions,
other sequences within introns or outside the gene that are important
for its expression, or perhaps another gene involved in factor VIII
expression that is very closely linked to the F8 gene. Higuchi et al.
(1991) designed a total of 45 primer sets to amplify 99% of the coding
region of the F8C gene and 41 of 50 splice junctions. After PCR
amplification they used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)
to identify successfully the point mutations in 26 DNAs with different
previously identified changes. Among 29 patients with unknown mutations,
they identified the disease-producing change in 25 (86%). Two
polymorphisms and 2 rare normal variants were also found.

Naylor et al. (1992) used an mRNA-based method to examine hemophilia A
mutations and were able to explain the report of Higuchi et al. (1991)
that mutations could not be identified in 14 of 30 severely affected
patients although mutations were found in all but 1 of 17 less severely
affected patients.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

In a Japanese family with mild to moderately severe hemophilia A, Young
et al. (1997) found a deletion of a single nucleotide T within an
A(8)TA(2) sequence of exon 14 of the F8 gene. The severity of the
clinical phenotype did not correspond to that expected of a frameshift
mutation. A small amount of functional factor VIII protein was detected
in the patient's plasma. Analysis of DNA and RNA molecules from normal
and affected individuals and in vitro transcription/translation
suggested a partial correction of the molecular defect, because of the
following: (i) DNA replication/RNA transcription errors resulted in
restoration of the reading frame and/or (ii) 'ribosomal frameshifting'
resulted in the production of normal factor VIII polypeptide and, thus,
in a milder-than-expected hemophilia A. All of these mechanisms probably
were promoted by the longer run of adenines, A(10) instead of A(8)TA(2),
after the deleted T. Young et al. (1997) concluded that errors in the
complex steps of gene expression therefore may partially correct a
severe frameshift defect and ameliorate an expected severe phenotype.

Cutler et al. (2002) identified 81 mutations in the F8C gene in 96
unrelated patients, all of whom had previously typed negative for the
common IVS22 inversion mutation (300841.0067). Forty-one of these
mutations were not recorded in F8C gene mutation databases. Analysis of
these 41 mutations with regard to location, possible cross-species
conservation, and type of substitution, in correlation with the clinical
severity of the disease, supported the view that the phenotypic result
of a mutation in the F8C gene correlates more with the position of the
amino acid change within the 3-dimensional structure of the protein than
with the actual nature of the alteration.

Gitschier et al. (1985) identified this mutation due to a CGA-to-TGA
change in codon 2326 in exon 26 in a patient with severe hemophilia A
(306700). Nonsense mutations and a different missense (arg-to-gln)

HEMOPHILIA A
F8, GLU272GLY

Youssoufian et al. (1988) demonstrated the usefulness of DNA
amplification followed by direct nucleotide sequencing in the search for
mutations in X-linked disorders because of the unambiguous sequencing
data obtained when the amplified DNA is from a male patient. In a
17-year-old Greek male with moderately severe hemophilia A (306700)
(JH20), they detected a mutation by analysis of genomic DNA with TaqI;
contrary to previous experience, the mutation was not a C-to-T or G-to-A
transition. (The unifying mechanism of these mutations is thought to be
methylation-induced C-to-T transitions at CpG dinucleotides involving
either the coding or the complementary strand of DNA; see Bird (1980).)
In this case the point mutation was in exon 7, where codon 291 for
glutamate (GAA) was changed to one for glycine (GGA), leading to a
change in amino acid 272 of the mature factor VIII protein. The mutation
had arisen de novo in a germ cell of the patient's mother. The patient
had 2% factor VIII activity, 3.5% factor VIII antigen, and moderate
hemophilia A.

In a patient with moderately severe hemophilia A (306700) of a
CRM-positive type, Gitschier (1988) found a CGC-to-TGC change in codon
1708 in exon 14, resulting in a change of arginine-1689 to cysteine. The
mutation affects the thrombin cleavage site. The same mutation was
subsequently found in additional patients (JH38, JH39) by Arai et al.
(1990). Aly et al. (1992) found that cysteamine, which is known to
modify mutant proteins with an arg-to-cys substitution, enhances the
procoagulant activity of the mutant factor VIII, which they referred to
as factor VIII-East Hartford. Aly and Hoyer (1992) demonstrated that the
East Hartford mutant protein had procoagulant activity when separated
from von Willebrand factor; this was taken to indicate that the
dissociation of factor VIII from VWF is an essential effect of factor
VIII light chain cleavage at arginine-1689.

In a study of the molecular defects responsible for crossreacting
material-positive hemophilia A (306700), Aly et al. (1992) found 2
patients in whom the nonfunctional factor VIII-like protein had
abnormal, slower-moving heavy or light chains on SDS/PAGE. Both patients
had severe hemophilia A with less than 1% of normal factor VIII activity
but with normal plasma level of factor VIII antigen. By denaturing
gradient gel electrophoresis screening of PCR-amplified products of the
factor VIII coding DNA sequence, followed by nucleotide sequencing of
the abnormal PCR products, they identified in 1 patient a met1772-to-thr
mutation that created a potential new N-glycosylation site at
asparagine-1770 in the factor VIII light chain. In the second patient,
an isoleucine-to-threonine substitution at position 566 created a
potential new N-glycosylation site at asparagine-564 in the A2 domain of
the factor VIII heavy chain.

Abnormal N-glycosylation, blocking factor VIII probe procoagulant
activity, represented a previously unrecognized mechanism for the
pathogenesis of severe hemophilia A.

HEMOPHILIA A, SEVERE
F8, IVS22 INV

Lakich et al. (1993) concluded that many mutations in the F8C gene
result from recombination between homologous sequences within intron 22
of the F8C gene and those upstream of the gene. Such a recombination
would lead to an inversion of all intervening DNA and a disruption of
the gene. Among 23 patients with severe hemophilia A (306700), Naylor et
al. (1993) found that approximately 40% were on the basis of this
mutation involving intron 22.

It is hypothesized that the inversion mutations occur almost exclusively
in germ cells during meiotic cell division by an intrachromosomal
recombination between a 9.6-kb sequence within intron 22 and 1 of 2
almost identical copies located about 300 kb distal to the factor VIII
gene at the telomeric end of the X chromosome. Most inversion mutations
originate in male germ cells, where the lack of bivalent formation may
facilitate flipping of the telomeric end of the single X chromosome.
Oldenburg et al. (2000) reported the first instance of intron 22
inversion presenting as somatic mosaicism in a female, affecting only
about 50% of lymphocyte and fibroblast cells of the proposita. Supposing
a postzygotic de novo mutation as the usual cause of somatic mosaicism,
the finding implies that the intron 22 inversion mutation is not
restricted to meiotic cell divisions but can also occur during mitotic
cell divisions, either in germ cell precursors or in somatic cells.

Lozier et al. (2002) found that the defect in the Chapel Hill hemophilia
A dog colony started by Brinkhous and Graham (1950) replicates the F8
gene inversion commonly seen in humans with severe hemophilia A.

Bidichandani et al. (1994) studied 15 randomly selected hemophilia A
(306700) patients, 9 of whom were severely affected. They reported a new
mutation affecting the intron 6 splice donor site in the factor VIII
gene of 2 patients, that corresponds to an exon skipping event involving
exon 5 and 6. The mutation is an A-to-G substitution at position +3 in
the splice donor site of intron 6 in both the patients. This exon
skipping event left the translational frame intact, and the resultant
in-frame deletion of 186-bp in the mature mRNA is predicted to cause a
shortening of the mature factor VIII polypeptide by 62 amino acid
residues. Direct sequencing showed that exon 5 is consistently skipped
along with exon 6 in the mature factor VIII mRNA. Both patients have a
disease of moderate severity and residual factor VIII activity 3% of the
normal. Bidichandani et al. (1994) noted that a patient lacking exon 5

Higuchi et al. (1991) and Diamond et al. (1992) identified this mutation
in 2 patients with less than 1% factor VIII activity and
severe-to-moderate hemophilia A (306700). The mutation was an AAT-to-AGT
transition at codon 1922 in exon 18 of the F8 gene, resulting in an
asn1922-to-ser (N1922S) substitution in the A3 domain of the protein.

Summers et al. (2011) noted that N1922 lies at the interface of 2 A3
subdomains in F8 and that the A3 and adjacent C1 domains form an
extensive hydrophobic interface. By expression in baby hamster kidney
cells, they found that F8 with the N1922S mutation (F8-N1922S) was
weakly secreted compared with wildtype F8, although secreted F8-N1922S
showed normal or near-normal activity. Wildtype F8 followed the classic
secretory pathway; however, F8-N1922S was delayed in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER), prior to processing and packaging in the Golgi. Use of
conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies revealed that the delay in
the ER was due to a defect in folding of the A3 domain and the adjacent
C1 domain. Summers et al. (2011) concluded that the N1922S substitution
results in poor secretion of a functional protein.

HEMOPHILIA A
F8, 1-BP DEL

Favier et al. (2000) described a 14-month-old girl with severe
hemophilia A (306700). Both of her parents had normal values of factor
VIII activity, and von Willebrand disease was excluded. Karyotype
analysis demonstrated no obvious alteration, and no F8 gene inversions
were found. Direct sequencing of the F8 gene exons revealed a
frameshift-stop mutation (Q565delC/ter566) in the heterozygous state in
the proposita only. F8 gene polymorphism analysis indicated that the
mutation must have occurred de novo in the paternal germline.
Furthermore, analysis of the pattern of X chromosome methylation at the
human androgen receptor gene locus demonstrated a skewed inactivation of
the derived maternal X chromosome from the lymphocytes of the proband's
DNA. Thus, the severe hemophilia A in the proposita resulted from a de
novo F8 gene mutation on the paternally derived X chromosome, associated
with a nonrandom pattern of inactivation of the maternally derived X
chromosome.

.0268
HEMOPHILIA A
F8, CYS179GLY

In 2 brothers with severe hemophilia A (306700), Mazurier et al. (2002)
found a T-to-G transversion in exon 4 of the F8C gene, resulting in a
cys179-to-gly (C179G) mutation. This mutation affected a cysteine
residue in the F8A1 domain that is conserved in the sequences of the
murine, canine, and swine factor 8 genes. A maternal first cousin showed
factor VIII deficiency and bleeding, but was found instead to have von
Willebrand disease type 2N (see 613554) due to compound heterozygous
mutations in the VWF gene (613160.0035 and 613160.0036).

HEMOPHILIA A
F8, TYR16CYS

Valleix et al. (2002) described an A-to-G transition in exon 1 of the F8
gene in monozygotic twin females that caused a tyr16-to-cys (Y16C)
mutation. Both twins were heterozygous for the mutation, which caused
severe hemophilia A (306700) in 1 and mild phenotype in the other. The
mutation was not present in the twins' healthy sister or parents,
suggesting that it had occurred de novo in the germline of 1 parent.

.0270
HEMOPHILIA A
F8, ALU INS

Sukarova et al. (2001) described a family with a severe form of
hemophilia A (306700) in which they identified an Alu retrotransposition
event in a coding exon, which represented the first report of an Alu
insertion in the F8 gene. The propositus was an 18-year-old Bulgarian
boy in whom the diagnosis of severe hemophilia had been made at the age
of 1 year. His 12-year-old brother was also affected. There was no other
family history of the disorder. The 341-bp element incorporated into the
F8C gene interrupted the reading frame of the mature protein at met1224,
resulting in a stop codon within the inserted sequence. Sequence
analysis showed that the inserted fragment was a full Alu repeat
belonging to the Yb8 subfamily of Alu repetitive sequences, according to
the standardized nomenclature for Alu repeats (Batzer et al., 1996). The
mutation site was flanked by a 5-bp (AAGAA) direct repeat which Sukarova
et al. (2001) stated was the shortest direct repeat described at the
integration points of Alu insertions.

Ganguly et al. (2003) reported a second instance: a 6-year-old male in
whom an Alu element was inserted at position -19 of intron 18 of the F8C
gene, causing skipping of exon 19 and hemophilia A. The insertion, which
did not affect the natural splice donor site, was in the opposite
orientation with respect to the direction of transcription of the F8
gene. The size of intron 18 was predicted to be increased by
approximately 331 nucleotides because of the insertion.

608303	TITLE *608303 LEUCINE-RICH GENE, GLIOMA-INACTIVATED, 4; LGI4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to LGI1 (604619),
followed by RT-PCR, Gu et al. (2002) cloned LGI4. The deduced 538-amino
acid protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide, a putative
transmembrane region, and 1 partial and 4 complete leucine-rich repeats
(LRRs). The LRRs are flanked on both sides by cysteine-rich regions, and
the N-terminal cysteine-rich region contains a motif conserved in LGIs.
LGI4 shares significant similarity with LGI1, LGI2 (608301), and LGI3
(608302). Semiquantitative PCR detected LGI4 expression in all tissues
examined, with highest expression in brain.

By in situ hybridization of adult mouse brain, Senechal et al. (2005)
showed that Lgi4 was expressed at high levels in the rostral migratory
stream and the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellar cortex. Lgi4 was
secreted in transfected 293T cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy
localized Lgi4 to discrete intracellular compartments, consistent with
its presence in ER, Golgi bodies, and vesicles.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gu et al. (2002) determined that the LGI4 gene contains 9 exons

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and radiation hybrid analysis, Gu et al.
(2002) mapped the LGI4 gene to chromosome 19q13.11. They mapped the
mouse Lgi4 gene to chromosome 7.

603865	TITLE *603865 GLUTAMINE:FRUCTOSE-6-PHOSPHATE AMIDOTRANSFERASE 2; GFPT2
;;GFAT2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) is the first and
rate-limiting enzyme of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. The enzyme
transfers the amide group from L-glutamine to fructose 6-phosphate to
form glucosamine 6-phosphate. See GFAT1 (GFPT1; 138292). By searching an
EST database for sequences related to GFAT1, Oki et al. (1999)
identified a cDNA encoding a new GFAT subtype that they called GFAT2.
The authors also cloned mouse GFAT2 cDNAs. The predicted 682-amino acid
human protein shares 76% and 97% similarity to human GFAT1 and mouse
Gfat2, respectively. Recombinant GFAT2 exhibited GFAT enzyme activity in
vitro. Northern blot analysis revealed that GFAT2 was expressed
predominantly as a 3-kb mRNA, although additional transcripts were
present in some tissues. The highest levels of expression were observed
in heart, placenta, and spinal cord.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2004) stated that the GFAT2 gene comprises 19 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Oki et al. (1999) mapped the GFAT2 gene to
5q34-q35. These authors used an interspecific backcross to map the mouse
Gfat2 gene to chromosome 11, in a region sharing homology of synteny
with human 5q23-q35.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Zhang et al. (2004) tested the hypothesis that GFPT2 sequence variation
contributed to susceptibility to type II diabetes mellitus (NIDDM;
125853) and diabetic nephropathy (see 603933) in Caucasian and African
American individuals. They identified 11 SNPs, of which 7 were common. A
single variant in exon 14 altered the amino acid sequence, was conserved
between human and mouse genes, and was associated with NIDDM among
Caucasians (p = 0.05). Several variants in the 3-prime untranslated
region (UTR) and exon 18 were also associated with NIDDM in Caucasian
individuals (P less than 0.05), and the SNP in the 3-prime UTR was
associated with diabetic nephropathy in African American subjects (p =
0.047). GFPT2 mRNA levels in transformed lymphocytes from study subjects
were significantly increased among African American subjects compared
with Caucasian individuals, regardless of diagnosis. The authors
proposed that the 3-prime UTR variant results in increased GFPT2 mRNA
levels with resultant increased hexosamine flux. They suggested that the
missense variant may contribute to altered protein function or may
simply be in linkage disequilibrium with SNPs in the 3-prime UTR.

;;tRNA-GUANINE TRANSGLYCOSYLASE; TGT;;
TGT, 43-KD SUBUNIT;;
TGT, CATALYTIC SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT; EC 2.4.2.29) synthesizes queuosine
(Q), which is found in tRNAs that recognize NAU and NAC codons, encoding
tyr, asn, asp, and his. Prokaryotic TGT is a single protein of 43 kD. In
contrast, mammalian TGT appears to be a heterodimer consisting of a
60-kD subunit (USP14; 607274) and a 43-kD catalytic subunit (QTRT1)
(Deshpande and Katze, 2001).

CLONING

By database analysis, Deshpande and Katze (2001) identified the QTRT1
gene, which encodes a 403-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular
mass of 44 kD. It shares significant identity with several bacterial and
eukaryotic homologs.

GENE FUNCTION

Deshpande and Katze (2001) found that transfection of a QTRT1 construct
into a TGT-negative human colon adenocarcinoma line restored the ability
of these cells to form Q-containing tRNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Deshpande and Katze (2001) determined that the QTRT1 gene contains 10
exons spanning approximately 12 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Deshpande and Katze (2001) mapped the
QTRT1 gene to chromosome 19p13.2.

107265	TITLE *107265 CD19 ANTIGEN; CD19
;;B-LYMPHOCYTE ANTIGEN CD19
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CD19 is a cell surface molecule expressed only by B lymphocytes and
follicular dendritic cells of the hematopoietic system. It is the
earliest of the B-lineage-restricted antigens to be expressed and is
present on most pre-B cells and most non-T-cell acute lymphocytic
leukemia cells and B-cell type chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells
(Tedder and Isaacs, 1989).

CLONING

Tedder and Isaacs (1989) isolated cDNA clones that encode CD19 from a
human tonsil cDNA library and determined the amino acid sequence. The
amino acid sequence showed no significant homology with other known
proteins, but the putative extracellular region contained 2 Ig-like
domains, indicating that CD19 is a new member of the Ig superfamily. The
CD19 molecule has a molecular mass of about 95,000 Da.

GENE FUNCTION

Carter and Fearon (1992) described the role of CD19 in helping the B
cell resolve its dilemma, the conflict between broad specificity and
sensitivity. The former is met by low-affinity antigen receptors, which
precludes achieving the latter with high-affinity receptors. Coligation
of CD19 with the antigen receptor of B lymphocytes decreases the
threshold for antigen receptor-dependent stimulation by 2 orders of
magnitude. Thus, B lymphocytes proliferate when approximately 100
antigen receptors per cell, 0.03% of the total, are ligated with CD19.

Fujimoto et al. (2000) noted that CD19, which contains a 240-amino acid
cytoplasmic tail with 9 conserved tyr (Y) residues, intersects with
multiple intracellular signaling pathways. LYN (165120), the predominant
Src kinase in B cells, is critical in B-cell antigen receptor (BCR,
e.g., IgM; 147020) signaling and regulation. Using cells from transgenic
mice, the authors demonstrated that following BCR and/or CD19 ligation,
LYN phosphorylates CD19 at Y513, then binds to CD19 via its SH2 domain
and phosphorylates Y482 through what Fujimoto et al. (2000) called
'processive phosphorylation.' Phosphorylated CD19-Y482 then recruits
another LYN molecule, leading to LYN phosphorylation and/or
autophosphorylation. CD19 phosphorylation induces conformational changes
that permit phosphorylation of CD19-Y391. This molecule then recruits
VAV (164875), which is in turn phosphorylated by LYN. In vivo, CD19
deficiency impaired, and CD19 overexpression enhanced, LYN kinase
activity. CD19 thus functions as a specialized adaptor protein for the
amplification of Src family kinases that is crucial for intrinsic and
antigen receptor-induced signal transduction.

Sato et al. (2000) subtly increased CD19 cell surface expression in mice
using transgenic techniques and found that these changes induced
autoantibody production. They found a similar increase in CD19
expression on B cells in patients with systemic sclerosis (see 181750),
whereas CD20 (MS4A1; 112210), CD22 (107266), and CD40 (109535)
expression was unchanged. Sato et al. (2000) proposed that modest
changes in expression of regulatory molecules, such as CD19, may shift
the balance between tolerance and immunity to autoimmunity.

MAPPING

Ord et al. (1994) assigned the CD19 gene to 16p11.2 by in situ
hybridization and by PCR analysis of a panel of human/hamster somatic
cell hybrid DNAs. The mouse gene was mapped to bands F3-F4 of chromosome
7 by in situ hybridization. Segregation analysis in interspecific
backcross progeny showed linkage to loci previously mapped to the same
region of mouse chromosome 7 in a region of conserved synteny with human
chromosome 16.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Van Zelm et al. (2006) evaluated 4 patients from 2 unrelated families
who had increased susceptibility to infection, hypogammaglobulinemia,
and normal numbers of mature B cells in blood, consistent with common
variable immunodeficiency (CVID3; 613493). They found that all 4
patients had homozygous mutations in the CD19 gene. Levels of CD19 were
undetectable in 1 patient and substantially reduced in the other 3.
Levels of CD21 (120650) were decreased, whereas levels of CD81 (186845)
and CD225 (IFITM1; 604456) were normal, in all 4 patients. The
composition of the precursor B-cell compartment in bone marrow and the
total numbers of B cells in blood were normal. However, the number of
CD27-positive (186711) memory B cells and CD5-positive (153340) B cells
were decreased. Secondary follicles in lymphoid tissues were small to
normal in size and had a normal cellular composition. The few B cells
that showed molecular signs of switching from one immunoglobulin class
to another contained V(H)-C(alpha) and V(H)-C(gamma) transcripts with
somatic mutations. The response of the patients' B cells to in vitro
stimulation through the B-cell receptor was impaired, and in all 4
patients, the antibody response to rabies vaccination was poor. Van Zelm
et al. (2006) concluded that mutation of the CD19 gene causes a type of
hypogammaglobulinemia in which the response of mature B cells to
antigenic stimulation is defective. On the basis of the crucial role of
CD19 in signaling by the B-cell receptor on antigen recognition, van
Zelm et al. (2006) thought it likely that defects in other members of
the CD19 complex (CD21, CD81, and CD225) also lead to antibody
deficiency in humans.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hasegawa et al. (2001) generated mice deficient in both Cd19 and Lyn.
Cd19 deficiency suppressed the hyperresponsive phenotype of Lyn -/- B
cells and autoimmunity characterized by serum autoantibodies and immune
complex-mediated glomerulonephritis in Lyn -/- mice. Cd19/Lyn -/- mice
had additional reduction of primitive, predominantly IgM-secreting B1
lymphocytes. Cd19 deficiency inhibited activation of Src family protein
tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathways and delayed enhanced
intracellular calcium responses following B-cell antigen receptor
ligation in Lyn -/- B cells. Hasegawa et al. (2001) concluded that Cd19
expression is required for the development of autoimmunity in Lyn -/-
mice.

By selective inactivation of Pten (601728) in mouse B lymphocytes and
immunohistochemical analysis, Anzelon et al. (2003) detected a selective
expansion of marginal zone (MZ) B and B1 cells. Pten-deficient B cells
were hyperproliferative in response to mitogenic stimuli and had a lower
threshold for activation through the B lymphocyte antigen receptor.
Inactivation of Pten rescued germinal center, MZ B, and B1 cell
formation in Cd19 -/- mice, which exhibit reduced activation of PI3K
(see PIK3CG; 601232). Anzelon et al. (2003) concluded that intracellular
phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate has a central role in the
regulation of differentiation of peripheral B-cell subsets.

Using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometric analysis, You et al.
(2009) demonstrated that Signr1 (see CD209; 604672)-positive MZ
macrophages were absent and Cd11c (ITGAX; 151510)-positive MZ dendritic
cells were abnormally distributed in Cd19 -/- mice. Adoptively
transferred normal mouse B cells could reconstitute MZ B cells in Cd19
-/- mice and restore MZ macrophage and dendritic cell distribution. In
contrast, Cd19 -/- B cells failed to enter the MZ of normal mice. You et
al. (2009) concluded that MZ B cells are required for MZ macrophage
differentiation and MZ dendritic cell localization, but that MZ B-cell
deficiency in Cd19 -/- mice is due to a defect of intrinsic B-cell
signaling.

Saito et al. (2002) found that B cells of 'tight-skin' (Tsk/+) mice (see
134797), a model for human systemic sclerosis, had decreased IgM
expression, enhanced serum IgG production, spontaneous autoantibody
production, and enhanced Cd19 tyrosine phosphorylation, Vav
phosphorylation, and Lyn kinase activity. Tsk/+ mice deficient in Cd19
expression showed decreased skin fibrosis, upregulated surface IgM
expression, abrogation of hypergammaglobulinemia and autoantibody
production, and inhibition of Il6 (147620) production. Saito et al.
(2002) concluded that chronic B-cell activation resulting from augmented
Cd19 signaling in Tsk/+ mice leads to skin sclerosis and autoimmunity,
possibly through overproduction of Il6.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
IMMUNODEFICIENCY, COMMON VARIABLE, 3
CD19, 1-BP INS, 972A

In a Turkish girl, born of consanguineous parents, who had common
variable immunodeficiency-3 (613493), van Zelm et al. (2006) identified
homozygosity for an insertion of an adenine in exon 6 of the CD19 gene.
This insertion caused a frameshift, resulting in a premature stop codon
at the intracellular amino acid 328. The patient had a history of
recurrent bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia starting at 1 year of age
and meningitis starting at 8 years of age. A diagnosis of postinfectious
glomerulonephritis was made at the age of 10 years, at which time she
was found to have hypogammaglobulinemia.

IMMUNODEFICIENCY, COMMON VARIABLE, 3
CD19, 2-BP DEL, 1384GA

In 3 sibs, offspring of unrelated parents of Colombian descent, examined
at ages 35, 33, and 49 years of age, respectively, for common variable
immunodeficiency (613493), van Zelm et al. (2006) identified
homozygosity for a dinucleotide deletion of guanine and adenine in exon
11 of the CD19 gene, resulting in a premature stop codon at the
intracellular amino acid 465. The parents and several members of the
family were heterozygous for the mutation but had no clinical features
of immunodeficiency. All 3 sibs had had otitis media, sinusitis, and
pharyngitis during childhood. In addition, 1 had had 4 bouts of
pneumonia between the ages of 18 and 35 years; he had received diagnoses
of bacterial conjunctivitis and chronic gastritis (Helicobacter pylori
infection). The study showed that the disruption of CD19 signaling
results in a primary antibody deficiency, mainly characterized by a poor
antigen-specific response. Normal levels of CD19 transcripts were found
in B cells from all patients.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Parrish et al. (1995) isolated a novel cDNA from the region of Xq28
between QM (312173) and DXS1010E. Translation of the long open reading
frame found in the cDNA yielded a putative 302-amino acid protein with
37.6% identity to human DNase I (125505). The protein was predicted to
contain a signal sequence at the amino terminus, a transmembrane domain
near the carboxyl terminus, and a helix-loop-helix domain. The
transcript was present at highest levels in skeletal and cardiac muscle,
with lower expression in other tissues.

Pergolizzi et al. (1996) screened cDNA libraries with a cosmid that had
been mapped to Xq28 in the region between RCP/GCP (300822; 300821) and
G6PD (305900). They obtained a 2.1-kb cDNA and showed that it encodes a
putative 302-amino acid protein with 44% sequence identity to pig DNase
I and 39% identity to human DNase I. Northern blot analysis detected a
single 2.0-kb transcript in adult heart and skeletal muscle and an
additional transcript of 2.5 kb in some fetal tissues. The sequence of
Pergolizzi et al. (1996) was identical to that reported by Parrish et
al. (1995).

MAPPING

The DNASE1L1 gene maps to chromosome Xq28 (Parrish et al., 1995).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Klugbauer and Hofmann (1996) isolated cDNA clones encoding the ABCA3
protein, which they designated ABCA3, from a human medullary thyroid
cancer cell line. ABCA3 has typical structural features of the ABC
transporter family (see 600046). They determined that the transporter
consists of a 1,704-amino acid polypeptide with 2 homologous repeats,
each harboring 6 putative transmembrane helices and an ATP-binding
cassette motif. The ABCA3 protein showed approximately 50% homology with
the MRP1 (158343) protein.

Connors et al. (1997) independently cloned the ABCA3 gene. By Northern
blot analysis, they found that the 6.8-kb mRNA was present at highest
levels in lung.

Using the 5-prime UTR of mouse Abca3 as probe, Yamano et al. (2001)
cloned ABCA3 from a lung cDNA library. Western blot analysis of crude
membrane fractions of human lung determined that ABCA3 migrated at an
apparent molecular mass of 150 kD. Immunohistochemical analysis of
alveoli showed ABCA3 expression only in alveolar type II (ATII) cells
that also expressed surfactant protein A (see 178630). At the
ultrastructural level, ABCA3 immunoreactivity was detected mostly at the
limiting membrane of the lamellar bodies.

By homology analysis of partial sequences, Mulugeta et al. (2002) found
that the ABCA3 protein is highly conserved among species. ABCA3
transcripts were found in cell lines of human lung origin, in ATII cells
of human, rat, and mouse, and in various rat tissues. Highest expression
of rat Abca3 was in ATII cells, and expression of Abca3 was at its
maximum in rats prior to birth.

Yoshida et al. (2004) cloned and characterized the promoter region of
the human ABCA3 gene and identified a potential
glucocorticoid-responsive element (GRE) motif. Electrophoretic mobility
shift assay using nuclear extracts from dexamethasone-treated cells from
a human ATII cell line demonstrated specific binding of the
glucocorticoid receptor to the GRE.

MAPPING

Klugbauer and Hofmann (1996) mapped the ABCA3 gene to chromosome 16p13.3
by comparison with an identical cDNA clone mapping to that chromosomal
region. They noted that the ABCA3 gene and the gene encoding MRP1 map
within the same chromosomal band.

GENE FUNCTION

Wu and Horvitz (1998) found that the C. elegans protein ced7 is
homologous to human ABCA3. Ced-7 functions in the engulfment of cell
corpses during programmed cell death, is broadly expressed during
embryogenesis, and is localized to the plasma membrane. Mosaic analysis
revealed that ced7 functions in both dying cells and engulfing cells
during the engulfment process. Wu and Horvitz (1998) proposed that ced7
functions to translocate molecules that mediate homotypic adhesion
between the cell surfaces of the dying and engulfing cells. They also
suggested that ABCA3 may be functionally similar and that the molecular
mechanism underlying cell corpse engulfment during programmed cell death
may be conserved from nematodes to mammals.

By Northern blot analysis, Mulugeta et al. (2002) found the expression
of ABCA3 increased more than 30-fold following stimulation of fetal lung
explants with dexamethasone, cAMP, and isobutylmethylxanthine. Because
ABCA3 is a member of a subfamily of ABC transporters involved in the
regulation of lipid transport and membrane trafficking, Mulugeta et al.
(2002) proposed that ABCA3 may play a role in lipid organization during
the formation of lamellar bodies.

Shulenin et al. (2004) examined lung tissue from 4 patients with severe
neonatal surfactant deficiency and different mutations of the ABCA3
gene. They found markedly abnormal lamellar bodies and concluded that
ABCA3 is critical for the proper formation of lamellar bodies and
surfactant function.

Yoshida et al. (2004) found that expression of ABCA3 in rat lung is
dramatically increased after embryonic day (E) 20.5. Administration of
dexamethasone to pregnant rats for 3 days starting on E15.5 markedly
induced expression of ABCA3 by E18.5. Dexamethasone also increased ABCA3
mRNA expression levels in human ATII cells 4-fold and upregulated
promoter activity of the ABCA3 5-prime flanking region containing the
GRE about 2-fold. Upregulation by dexamethasone was not observed when
the GRE-containing region was deleted or when a point mutation was
introduced into the GRE. Yoshida et al. (2004) concluded that
glucocorticoid-induced upregulation of ABCA3 expression in vivo is
mediated by transcriptional activation through the GRE in the promoter,
and suggested that ABCA3 plays an important role in the formation of
pulmonary surfactant, probably by transporting lipids such as
cholesterol.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 16 of 21 racially and ethnically diverse infants with severe neonatal
respiratory distress and surfactant deficiency (610921), Shulenin et al.
(2004) identified mutations in the ABCA3 gene (see
601615.0001-601615.0006). They detected nonsense and frameshift
mutations, as well as mutations in highly conserved residues and in
splice sites of the gene. In 5 consanguineous families with mutations,
each pair of sibs was homozygous for the same mutation and each mutation
was found in only 1 family. Most of the infants died within 1 month
after birth, although 1 child who was heterozygous was still alive at 6
years of age.

In a male infant who died in the neonatal period from surfactant-related
respiratory failure, Kunig et al. (2007) identified homozygosity for a
missense mutation in the ABCA3 gene (601615.0007).

Kaltenborn et al. (2012) studied the effects of 2 clinically relevant
ABCA3 mutations, E292V and Q215K, alone and in combination with
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. The authors noted that
E292V has a prevalence of 1:277 in the United States and thus is the
most common ABCA3 mutation reported in children (Garmany et al., 2008);
the Q215K mutation was reported in a neonate who died of respiratory
distress (Brasch et al., 2006). After stable transfection into A549 lung
epithelial cells, the ABCA3 mutations strongly impaired expression of
the alveolar type II differentiation marker SPC (178620) and the
epithelial cell adhesion proteins E-cadherin (192090) and zonula
occludens-1 (601009). Concurrently, cells expressing the ABCA3 mutations
acquired mesenchymal features as evidenced by increased expression of
SNAI1 (604238), MMP2 (120360), and TGFB1 (190180), and elevated
phosphorylation of SRC (190090). Infection with the most common viral
respiratory pathogen in small children, RSV, potentiated the transition
from epithelial to mesenchymal characteristics as well as a morphologic
shift to a mesenchymal phenotype. Kaltenborn et al. (2012) suggested
that impairment of epithelial function might be a mechanism by which
ABCA3 mutations cause interstitial lung disease.

affected sib, Shulenin et al. (2004) identified heterozygosity for a
4772A-C transversion in exon 31 of the ABCA3 gene, resulting in a
gln1591-to-pro (Q1591P) mutation. The patient was still alive at 6 years

are not fatal; however, a second mutation in the ABCA3 gene was not
identified.

transition in exon 14 of the ABCA3 gene, resulting in an asn568-to-asp
(N568D) mutation. The patient died after lung transplantation. The N568
residue is within the N-terminal ATP-binding domain and is conserved in
the mammalian and fish ABCA3 genes as well as almost all other members
of ABC subfamily A. The corresponding residue is mutated in the ABCA1

patient differed from previously reported cases in that his initial
presentation was severe pulmonary hypertension that appeared to be out
of proportion to the degree of lung disease.

608424	TITLE *608424 MUCIN 17; MUC17
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Membrane mucins, such as MUC17, function in epithelial cells to provide
cytoprotection, maintain luminal structure, provide signal transduction,
and confer antiadhesive properties upon cancer cells that lose their
apical/basal polarization.

CLONING

By database searching and RT-PCR to extend a partial mucin-like sequence
found during analysis of MUC3 (see 158371), Gum et al. (2002) cloned
MUC17. The deduced 1,029-amino acid protein contains 5 N-terminal thr-,
ser-, and pro-rich tandem repeats, followed by a region with degenerate
tandem repeats and mucin-like sequences; 2 EGF (131530)-like domains
separated by a SEA module; a putative transmembrane domain; and a
C-terminal cytoplasmic domain with potential serine and tyrosine
phosphorylation sites. RNA dot blot analysis of several tissues detected
highest expression in duodenum and transverse colon. The only
nonintestinal tissues that expressed MUC17 were stomach and fetal
kidney. Expression was also detected in several colon and pancreatic
cancer cell lines. In situ hybridization showed MUC17 expression
predominantly in the apical region of mature intestinal absorptive
epithelial cells. Barely detectable expression was found in immature
cells of the crypts.

Using real-time RT-PCR, Moehle et al. (2006) found that MUC17 was highly
expressed in adult small intestine, followed by stomach and colon. Weak
expression was detected in prostate and uterus, with no expression
detected in other tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

By microarray analysis, Moehle et al. (2006) found coordinated
downregulation of mucins, including MUC17, in colon of patients with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; see 266600), including Crohn disease
and ulcerative colitis, compared with controls. They identified an
NF-kappa-B (see 164011)-binding site in the MUC17 promoter and showed
that activation of the NF-kappa-B signaling pathway by inflammatory
cytokines TNF-alpha (TNF; 191160) and TGF-beta (TGFB1; 190180)
upregulated MUC17 mRNA expression about 2-fold and 3-fold, respectively.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Gum et al. (2002) mapped the MUC17 gene to
chromosome 7q22.

;;KILLER LINEAGE PROTEIN 1; KLIP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using RNA differential display to identify genes expressed during early
human embryonic hematopoiesis, followed by screening a human lung cDNA
library, Prost et al. (2002) cloned YIPF3, which they designated KLIP1.
The deduced 350-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 37
to 38 kD. KLIP1 contains an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by an
extracellular domain, 5 transmembrane regions, and a cytoplasmic
C-terminal sequence. It also has 3 potential protein kinase C (see
PRKCA; 176960) phosphorylation sites. KLIP1 expression closely
correlated with hematopoietic activity in both intra- and
extra-embryonic hematopoietic sites. In day 30/32 human embryo sections,
KLIP1 protein expression was restricted to circulating hematopoietic
cells at hematopoiesis sites. Membrane KLIP1 was expressed by fetal and
adult GPA (111300)-positive erythroblasts, the fetal liver CD34
(142230)-positive subset, fetal spleen, and adult bone marrow CD56
(NCAM1; 116930)-positive natural killer and CD19 (107265)-positive B
cells. Among mature blood cells, surface KLIP1 expression was restricted
to CD56-positive natural killer cells. Western blot analysis of fetal
liver extracts and in vitro translated KLIP1 cDNA detected the KLIP1
protein at an apparent molecular mass of 37 kD. Phylogenetic analysis
indicated that KLIP1 is highly conserved.

GENE STRUCTURE

Prost et al. (2002) determined that the YIPF3 gene contains 9 exons and
spans about 5 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Prost et al. (2002) mapped the YIPF3 gene
to chromosome 6p21.2-p21.1.

172280	TITLE *172280 PHOSPHOGLYCOLATE PHOSPHATASE; PGP
DESCRIPTION This enzyme (EC 3.1.3.18) may have an important regulatory influence on
oxygen transport in man by indirectly affecting the level of red cell
2,3-diphosphoglycerate. (The spellings 'phosphoglycolate' and
'phosphoglycollate' have been used interchangeably, but the former is
preferred.) Barker and Hopkinson (1978) devised a method for detecting
PGP isozymes after starch-gel electrophoresis. They are present in all
human tissues, with highest activities in skeletal and cardiac muscle.
Six different electrophoretic phenotypes were identified. Family studies
showed that these are determined by 3 alleles at an autosomal locus. In
a sample of Europeans, the frequency of the alleles were PGP(1), 0.826;
PGP(2), 0.129; PGP(3), 0.045. The 3-banded isozyme pattern in
heterozygotes suggested that the enzyme is dimeric.

The phosphoglycolate phosphatase locus was assigned to chromosome 16 by
Donald et al. (1979) and by Blankenstein-Wijnen et al. (1979). Family
data suggested that PGP is not close to 16qh or alpha-haptoglobin (Povey
et al., 1980). The most likely regional assignment was considered to be
16p13 or 16p12, but a site on 16q could not be excluded (Povey et al.,
1980). Koeffler et al. (1981) assigned the PGP locus to 16p by mouse-man
somatic cell hybridization. Bale et al. (1984) suggested the existence
of recombination heterogeneity in the linkage with haptoglobin. Reeders
et al. (1986) showed that the PGP locus is, like the alpha-globin locus,
close to the adult polycystic kidney disease locus (maximum lod = 8.21,
theta = 0.00). PGP versus the 3-prime-HVR (hypervariable region 3-prime
to the alpha-globin locus) gave a maximum lod score of 11.61 at theta =
0.00. Thus, PGP, HBA, and APCKD are all close together on 16p. Mulley et
al. (1990) assigned the PGP gene to 16p13.3 by electrophoretic detection
of enzymes from a human/mouse somatic cell panel, the members of which
carried portions of human chromosome 16 with precisely defined
breakpoints. Eiberg et al. (1993) reported a suggestion of linkage
between manic-depressive illness (125480) and PGP; a maximum lod score
of 2.20 at 0% recombination was found in a single large family. A second
family was uninformative.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

610195	TITLE *610195 PROSTATE TUMOR OVEREXPRESSED GENE 1; PTOV1
;;ACTIVATOR INTERACTION DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; ACID2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display to identify genes upregulated in prostate
tumors, followed by database analysis and RT-PCR, Benedit et al. (2001)
cloned PTOV1. The deduced 416-amino acid protein consists almost
entirely of 2 tandemly arranged blocks that share 66% identity and are
joined by a short linker sequence. PTOV1 was predicted to form
alternating alpha helices and beta sheets. Northern blot analysis
detected a 1.8-kb transcript abundantly expressed in brain, heart,
skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver. Normal prostate expressed low PTOV1
levels. Western blot analysis of prostate tumor tissue detected PTOV1 at
an apparent molecular mass of 58 kD. Immunocytochemical analysis
detected endogenous PTOV1 in the cytoplasm, concentrated around the
nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Benedit et al. (2001) found that PTOV1 was overexpressed in 9 of 11
prostate tumor samples. It was markedly overexpressed in foci of
prostate tumors with malignant morphology, and it was modestly elevated,
but with a homogeneous distribution, in morphologically normal cells
located in benign peripheral zones of the same tumors. In a human
prostate carcinoma cell line, expression of PTOV1 increased following
exposure to 5-alpha-dihydroxytestosterone.

By immunohistochemical analysis, Santamaria et al. (2003) found that
PTOV1 was overexpressed in 71% of 38 prostate carcinomas and in 80% of
samples with prostate intraepithelial neoplasia. High levels of PTOV1 in
tumors correlated significantly with proliferative index and
localization of PTOV1 in the nucleus. In quiescent cultured prostate
tumor cells, PTOV1 localized to the cytoplasm and was excluded from
nuclei. After serum stimulation, PTOV1 partially translocated to the
nucleus at the beginning of S phase. At the end of mitosis, PTOV1 exited
the nucleus. Transient transfection of fluorescence-tagged PTOV1 forced
entry of cells into S phase and increased expression of cyclin D1
(CCND1; 168461).

Santamaria et al. (2005) found that PTOV1 interacted with the lipid raft
protein flotillin-1 (FLOT1; 606998) in detergent-insoluble membrane
fractions. Flotillin-1 colocalized with PTOV1 at the plasma membrane and
in the nucleus, and it entered the nucleus concomitant with PTOV1
shortly before initiation of S phase. Protein levels of PTOV1 and
flotillin-1 oscillated during the cell cycle, with a peak in S phase.
Depletion of PTOV1 significantly inhibited nuclear localization of
flotillin-1, whereas depletion of flotillin-1 did not affect nuclear
localization of PTOV1. Depletion of either protein markedly inhibited
cell proliferation under basal conditions. Overexpression of PTOV1 or
flotillin-1 strongly induced proliferation, which required their
localization to the nucleus and was dependent on the reciprocal protein.
Santamaria et al. (2005) concluded that PTOV1 assists flotillin-1 in its
translocation to the nucleus and that both proteins are required for
cell proliferation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Benedit et al. (2001) determined that the PTOV1 gene contains 12 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Benedit et al. (2001) mapped the PTOV1 gene to chromosome
19q13.3-q13.4.

;;TRIMERIC INTRACELLULAR CATION CHANNEL TYPE A; TRICA;;
MITSUGUMIN 33
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the course of screening membrane proteins participating in cellular
calcium handling, Yazawa et al. (2007) identified a protein with a
calculated molecular mass of 33,300 from rabbit skeletal muscle, and
called it trimeric intracellular cation channel (TRIC) type A. The
authors identified TRIC channel subtypes TRICA and TRICB (611236) from
several species, including human. TRICA contains 3 proposed
transmembrane segments, and forms homotrimers with a bullet-like
structure. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues indicated that TRICA
is preferentially expressed in excitable tissues, including striated
muscle and brain. Western blot analysis of fractionated muscle membranes
suggested that TRICA is distributed throughout the sarcoplasmic
reticulum but not in the cell surface membranes. In further
immunochemical studies antibodies to TRICA decorated the sarcoplasmic
reticulum and nuclear membranes in skeletal muscle. In limited
proteolysis analysis using membrane vesicles, Yazawa et al. (2007) found
that the amino terminus of TRICA is located in the sarcoplasmic
reticulum/endoplasmic reticulum lumen, whereas the carboxy terminus of
TRICA is exposed to the cytoplasm.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yazawa et al. (2007) generated knockout mice lacking TRICA. Trica-null
mice were viable and fertile. Trica/Tricb double knockout mice exhibited
a weak heartbeat at embryonic day 9.5 and subsequent loss of
cardiomyocyte viability, leading to terminal embryonic cardiac lethality
beyond embryonic day 10.5. These data suggested that TRIC subtypes share
complementary physiologic functions. TRIC-deficient skeletal muscle
sarcoplasmic reticulum showed reduced potassium permeability, as well as
altered calcium ion 'spark' signaling and voltage-induced calcium
release. Therefore, Yazawa et al. (2007) concluded that TRIC channels
are likely to act as counter-ion channels that function in
synchronization and calcium release from intracellular stores.

610316	TITLE *610316 POLYRIBONUCLEOTIDE NUCLEOTIDYLTRANSFERASE 1; PNPT1
;;OLD35;;
PNPase
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PNPT1 is a subunit of the exosome complex, which is involved in
3-prime-to-5-prime exoribonuclease activity for RNA processing and
degradation (Raijmakers et al., 2002). The enzyme is predominantly
located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and is involved in
import of RNA to mitochondria (Vedrenne et al., 2012).

CLONING

By screening for genes expressed in both terminally differentiated and
senescent cells, followed by 3-prime and 5-prime RACE of a human
metastatic melanoma cell line cDNA library, Leszczyniecka et al. (2002)
cloned 2 variants of PNPT1, which they called OLD35. The variants differ
only in the length of their 3-prime UTRs, and both encode a deduced
783-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 86 kD. PNPT1
contains 2 RNase PH domains, a KH domain, and a C-terminal S1 domain.
Northern blot analysis detected 4.0- and 2.6-kb transcripts in
terminally differentiated human melanoma cells.

Raijmakers et al. (2002) identified a putative mitochondrial targeting
sequence in the N terminus of PNPT1. By immunohistochemical analysis,
Piwowarski et al. (2003) demonstrated colocalization of endogenous PNPT1
with a mitochondrial marker protein in HeLa cells. Mutation analysis
confirmed that N-terminal sequences of PNPT1 target it to mitochondria.

Leszczyniecka et al. (2003) cloned mouse Pnpt1, which encodes a
782-amino acid protein that shares about 90% amino acid identity with
human PNPT1.

Von Ameln et al. (2012) demonstrated expression of the Pnpt1 gene in the
murine cochlea, including the inner and outer sensory hair cells and the
auditory ganglion neurons. The protein showed predominantly
mitochondrial localization. The zebrafish ortholog was broadly expressed
during early development, and later showed more restricted expression in
the tectum, the gill arches, and the developing ear. The findings were
compatible with a role for the protein auditory function.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro analysis of the recombinant protein, Leszczyniecka et al.
(2002) found that PNPT1 was a phosphate-dependent 3-prime-to-5-prime RNA
exonuclease that produced nucleotide diphosphates, but not nucleotide
monophosphates, during degradation of an RNA substrate. Expression of
PNPT1 was induced by interferon-beta (see IFNB1; 147640) in a human
metastatic melanoma cell line, and expression of PNPT1 suppressed
melanoma cell colony formation.

By mutation analysis of the PNPT1 promoter, Leszczyniecka et al. (2003)
found that a region containing an interferon-stimulated regulatory
element (ISRE) and an SP1 (189906) element was required for
IFNB-stimulated PNPT1 expression in a human melanoma cell line, but a
GAS element and an IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF1; 147575)-binding site
were not required. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated
that the ISGF3 complex (see ISGF3G; 147574) bound the ISRE, and IFNB
stimulation increased ISGF3 binding. PNPT1 mRNA levels and promoter
activity were stimulated about 3.5-fold by IFNB in a human fibrosarcoma
cell line, but not in lines defective in JAK (see JAK1; 147795)-STAT
(see STAT1; 600555) signaling. IFNB did not affect PNPT1 mRNA stability,
and PNPT1 upregulation did not require protein synthesis, indicating
that PNPT1 is an early IFN response gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Leszczyniecka et al. (2003) determined that the PNPT1 gene contains 28
exons and spans about 54 kb. The promoter region has no TATA or CAAT
elements, but has an ISRE, a GAS element, and IRF1-binding sites. The
3-prime UTR of PNPT1 is AU rich and contains 4 AUUUA motifs.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid and genomic sequence analyses, Leszczyniecka et al.
(2003) mapped the PNPT1 gene to chromosome 2p16.1-p15. They identified
PNPT1 pseudogenes on chromosomes 3p26.1 and 7q31.31.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency 13

In 2 Moroccan sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with combined
oxidative phosphorylation deficiency-13 (COXPD13; 614932), Vedrenne et
al. (2012) identified a homozygous mutation in the PNPT1 gene (Q387R;
610316.0001). The patients had a severe encephalomyopathy with onset of
severe hypotonia and movement abnormalities in late infancy. Biochemical
studies showed that the mutation impaired normal import of several RNA
species into mitochondria and caused a defect in mitochondrial
translation, resulting in mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency.

- Autosomal Recessive Deafness 70

By homozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene analysis of a
Moroccan family with autosomal recessive deafness-70 (DFNB70; 614934),
von Ameln et al. (2012) identified a homozygous mutation in the PNPT1
gene (E475G; 610316.0002). The mutant protein was expressed, stable, and
showed normal mitochondrial localization in HEK293T cells, but in vitro
studies in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells showed that the mutation
results in a hypofunctional protein leading to disturbed PNPase
trimerization and impaired mitochondrial RNA import. The findings
indicated that PNPT1 plays a role in auditory function.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COMBINED OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION DEFICIENCY 13
PNPT1, GLN387ARG

In 2 Moroccan sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with early-onset
encephalomyopathy due to combined oxidative phosphorylation
deficiency-13 (COXPD13; 614932), Vedrenne et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous 1160A-G transition in exon 13 of the PNPT1 gene, resulting in
a gln387-to-arg (Q387R) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The
mutation was found by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. Patient fibroblasts showed about 50 to 60% of normal PNPase
levels, suggesting that the mutation destabilizes the mutant protein.
Immunoblot analysis of patient cells showed absence of PNPase trimers,
suggesting that the mutation alters multimerization of the protein.
Patient cells also showed a significant decrease in 5S rRNA (180420) and
RNase mitochondrial RNA processing (MRP)-related RNA import into
mitochondria compared to control; similar findings were observed in
control cells with siRNA knockdown of PNPT1. Patient cells also showed a
decrease in mitochondrial translation. Overexpression of wildtype PNPT1
in patient cells rescued these defects.

In 3 Moroccan sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with autosomal

(2012) identified a homozygous 1424A-G transition resulting in
substitution of gly at glu475 (E475G), a highly conserved residue in the
second RNase-PH domain. The mutation segregated with deafness in the
family and was not found in multiple control databases. The mutant
protein was expressed, stable, and showed normal mitochondrial
localization in HEK293T cells, but in vitro studies in bacteria, yeast,
and mammalian cells showed that the mutation results in a hypofunctional
protein leading to disturbed PNPase trimerization and impaired
mitochondrial RNA import.

;;MRGD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dong et al. (2001) identified, in the mouse and human genomes, a family
of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) related to the MAS1 oncogene
(165180), including MRGD. Several pseudogenes were also identified. The
predicted MRG proteins contain transmembrane, extracellular, and
cytoplasmic domains. A subset of MRGs was expressed in specific
subpopulations of sensory neurons that detect painful stimuli. The
expression patterns of these genes thus revealed an unexpected degree of
molecular diversity among nociceptive neurons. Some MRGs could be
specifically activated in heterologous cells by RFamide neuropeptides
such as NPFF and NPAF (see 604643), which are analgesic in vivo. The
authors concluded that MRGs may regulate nociceptor function and/or
development, including the sensation or modulation of pain.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Dong et al. (2001) mapped the MRGD gene to
chromosome 11.

;;MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED TRANSPORTER PROTEIN; MATP;;
MELANOMA ANTIGEN AIM1; AIM1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The AIM1 gene encodes a melanocyte differentiation antigen that is
expressed in a high percentage of melanoma cell lines. Its homolog in
medaka fish, 'B,' encodes a transporter that mediates melanin synthesis
(Fukamachi et al., 2001).

CLONING

Harada et al. (2001) identified an antigen in human melanoma that they
called AIM1 protein. The AIM1 gene was expressed in 3 melanoma cell
lines, but not in a fibroblast cell line, and not at significant levels
in any of 15 normal tissues. The human AIM1 gene encodes a protein of
530 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected 2 transcripts, one of
1.7 kb and the other of 2.8 kb. Harada et al. (2001) concluded that the
AIM1 gene encodes a melanocyte differentiation antigen that is expressed
in a high percentage of melanoma cell lines.

Fukamachi et al. (2001) used a positional cloning effort to isolate a
medaka pigment gene highly homologous to human AIM1. This gene encodes a
transporter that mediates melanin synthesis. The medaka AIM1 protein
consists of 12 transmembrane domains and is 55% identical to human AIM1.
Fukamachi et al. (2001) also isolated a highly homologous gene from the
mouse, indicating a conserved function of vertebrate melanogenesis.

Newton et al. (2001) identified the human AIM1 gene, which they
designated MATP, by study of human chromosome 5p, a region showing
syntenic homology with the proximal region of mouse chromosome 15 where
the underwhite (uw) locus maps. They cloned the human MATP and mouse uw
cDNAs and determined that the deduced human and mouse proteins share 82%
sequence identity. Both proteins are approximately 58 kD and are
predicted to span a lipid bilayer 12 times.

GENE FUNCTION

Du and Fisher (2002) determined that MATP is transcriptionally modulated
by MITF (156845), a melanocyte-specific transcription factor. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation did not detect direct binding of MITF to a 5-prime
flanking region of MATP, suggesting that MITF may act indirectly or may
bind to a remote regulatory sequence.

GENE STRUCTURE

Newton et al. (2001) determined that the SLC45A2 gene contains 7 exons
spanning a region of approximately 40 kb.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Newton et al. (2001) mapped the SLC45A2 gene to
chromosome 5p.

EVOLUTION

Sabeti et al. (2007) reported an analysis of over 3 million
polymorphisms from the International HapMap Project Phase 2. The
analysis revealed more than 300 strong candidate regions that appeared
to have undergone recent natural selection. Examination of 22 of the
strongest regions highlighted 3 cases in which 2 genes in a common
biologic process had apparently undergone positive selection in the same
population: LARGE (603590) and DMD (300377), both related to infection
by the Lassa virus, in West Africa; SLC24A5 (609802) and SLC45A2, both
involved in skin pigmentation, in Europe; and EDAR (604095) and EDA2R
(300276), both involved in the development of hair follicles, in Asia.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Turkish patient with oculocutaneous albinism type IV (OCA4;
606574), Newton et al. (2001) identified a homozygous mutation in the
MATP gene (606202.0001).

Rundshagen et al. (2004) screened 176 German patients with albinism for
mutations in the MATP gene; in 5, they identified homozygous or compound
heterozygous mutations (see 606202.0002-606202.0005).

In 18 of 75 (24%) Japanese patients with OCA, Inagaki et al. (2004)
identified 7 mutations in the MATP gene (see, e.g., 606202.0006).

- Normal Pigment Variation

Studying Caucasians, Asians, African Americans, and Australian
Aborigines, Graf et al. (2005) found association particularly with 2
polymorphisms, G272K (606202.0007) and F374L (606202.0008), with normal
variation in human pigmentation (SHEP5; 227240).

Graf et al. (2007) examined the association between normal skin color
variation in several populations and 3 different promoter polymorphisms
in the MATP gene: -1721C-G (dbSNP rs13289), -1169G-A (dbSNP rs6867641),
and a 3-bp duplication, -1174dupAAT. In Caucasian samples, -1721C-G and
-1174dupAAT were in complete linkage disequilibrium. In Caucasians only,
the -1721G, -1169A, and +dup alleles were significantly associated with
olive skin color. Functional analysis in melanoma skin cells showed that
this promoter haplotype decreased MATP transcription, suggesting a
functional significance.

Stokowski et al. (2007) demonstrated an association between the SNP
dbSNP rs16891982 (F374L; 606202.0008) and skin pigmentation variation in
individuals of South Asian descent.

ANIMAL MODEL

Newton et al. (2001) and Du and Fisher (2002) determined that mutations
in the mouse Matp gene underlie the underwhite (uw) pigmentation
phenotype. Underwhite alleles manifest altered pigmentation of both eye
and fur, sometimes in an age-dependent fashion.

Xu et al. (2013) found that white tigers, characterized by white fur and
dark stripes, are homozygous for a C-to-T transition in exon 7 of the
Slc45a2 gene, resulting in an ala477-to-val (A477V) substitution in
transmembrane domain 11. Homology modeling suggested that A477 faces the
inner surface of the transporter cavity and that its mutation may hinder
substrate transport. Xu et al. (2013) hypothesized that Slc45a2 may be a
sucrose/proton symporter that regulates organellar pH and/or osmotic
balance for synthesis of red/yellow pheomelanin, with little or no
effect on the synthesis of black eumelanin.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OCULOCUTANEOUS ALBINISM, TYPE IV
SLC45A2, IVS2, G-A, -1

In a Turkish patient with oculocutaneous albinism type IV (606574),
whose generalized hypopigmentation and ocular abnormalities were
relatively mild, Newton et al. (2001) identified a homozygous G-to-A
transition in the splice acceptor sequence of exon 2 of the SLC45A2
gene. The patient's parents were heterozygous for this mutation. The
authors noted that the mutation likely results in the in-frame deletion
of exon 2, which codes for transmembrane domain-4, and would result in a
change in the orientation of transmembrane domains 5-12 relative to the
membrane.

.0002
OCULOCUTANEOUS ALBINISM, TYPE IV
SLC45A2, LEU361PRO

In a German patient with oculocutaneous albinism type IV (606574),
Rundshagen et al. (2004) identified a homozygous 1082T-C transition in
exon 5 of the MATP gene, resulting in a leu361-to-pro (L361P) change.
Each parent was heterozygous for the mutation.

.0003
OCULOCUTANEOUS ALBINISM, TYPE IV
SLC45A2, 1-BP DEL, 986C

In 2 German patients with oculocutaneous albinism type IV (606574),
Rundshagen et al. (2004) identified a 1-bp deletion in exon 4 of the
MATP gene, 986delC, resulting in a frameshift at codon 329 and a
translation stop in exon 6. In each patient the frameshift mutation was
present in compound heterozygous state: in one patient with a 3-bp
deletion (nucleotides 661-663), resulting in deletion of phe221
(606202.0004), and in the other with an A486V mutation (606202.0005).

.0006
OCULOCUTANEOUS ALBINISM, TYPE IV
SLC45A2, ASP157ASN

In 2 Japanese patients with oculocutaneous albinism type IV (606574),
Inagaki et al. (2004) identified homozygosity for a G-to-A transition in
exon 2 of the MATP gene, resulting in an asp157-to-asn (D157N)
substitution. The mutation occurs at the first residue in the second
cytoplasmic loop of the protein. Ten other patients had 1 D157N mutant
allele; the allele frequency of D157N in all patients with OCA4 was
0.39, indicating that it is the most common mutant allele in Japanese
patients with OCA4.

Inagaki et al. (2005) investigated the haplotypes of 20 alleles carrying
the D157N mutation from 1 Korean and 21 Japanese OCA4 patients and found
1 Korean and 12 Japanese alleles to be associated with so-called
'haplotype 15' (G-A-G-A-G), consistent with a founder effect for the
D157N mutation in East Asia.

SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 5, DARK/FAIR SKIN, INCLUDED;;
SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 5, DARK/LIGHT EYES, INCLUDED
SLC45A2, GLU272LYS

In Caucasians, Graf et al. (2005) found a significant association
between 2 polymorphisms of the MATP gene, an 814G-A transition resulting
in a glu272-to-lys substitution (G272K) and a 1122C-G transversion
resulting in a phe374-to-leu substitution (F374L; 606202.0008). The 2
alleles, leu374 and lys272, were significantly associated with dark
hair, skin, and eye color in Caucasians (SHEP5; 227240). The odds ratios
of the leu/leu genotype for black hair and olive skin were 25.63 and
28.65, respectively, and for the lys/lys genotype were 43.23 and 8.27,
respectively. The odds ratio for eye color was lower at 3.48 for the
leu/leu and 6.57 for the lys/lys genotypes.

SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 5, BLACK/NONBLACK HAIR
SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 5, DARK/FAIR SKIN, INCLUDED;;
SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 5, DARK/LIGHT EYES, INCLUDED
SLC45A2, PHE374LEU

See 606202.0007 and Graf et al. (2005).

Yuasa et al. (2006), who referred to this polymorphism as L374F, studied
the distribution of the F374 allele in 1,649 unrelated subjects from 13
Eurasian populations and 1 African population. The highest allele
frequency was observed in Germans (0.965); French and Italians showed
somewhat lower frequencies; and Turks had an intermediate value (0.615).
Indians and Bangladeshis from South Asia were characterized by low
frequencies (0.147 and 0.059, respectively). They also found the F374
allele in some East and Southeast Asian populations, and explained this
by admixture. Haplotype analysis revealed that the haplotype diversity
was much lower in Germans than in Japanese, suggesting that the L374F
mutation occurred only once in the ancestry of Caucasians. The large
differences in distribution of the F374 allele and its haplotype
suggested that this allele may be an important factor in
hypopigmentation in Caucasian populations.

In a genomewide association study of skin pigmentation variation (SHEP5;
227240) using 1,620,742 SNPs in a population of 737 individuals of South
Asian ancestry living in the United Kingdom, Stokowski et al. (2007)
found association of the SLC45A2 SNP dbSNP rs16891982 (L374F) with skin
pigmentation. The association was replicated in a second independent
cohort of 235 individuals.

Stacey et al. (2009) confirmed the association of the dbSNP rs16891982
variant with fair pigmentation and found association of this SNP with
susceptibility to basal cell carcinoma in 3,326 basal cell carcinoma
cases and 5,493 controls of European ancestry (odds ratio = 1.97, P =
1.6 x 10(-12)).

Guedj et al. (2008) analyzed the F374L variant in 1,019 Caucasian
melanoma patients (see 155600) and 1,466 Caucasian controls and found an
association for protection from melanoma (p = 2.12 x 10(-15); odds ratio
= 0.35 and 0.32 for the F/L and F/F genotypes, respectively). The
association remained significant in a logistic model integrating
pigmentation characteristics (p = 4.16 x 10(-3)).

In a Spanish case-control study involving 131 consecutive melanoma
patients and 245 controls, Fernandez et al. (2008) found the F374L
variant of the SLC45A2 gene to be associated with protection from
malignant melanoma (odds ratio = 0.41; p = 0.008 after adjustment for
multiple testing). Adjustment for 6 potential confounders (age,
blond/red hair color, fair/pale skin color, solar lentigines, number of
nevi, and the presence of childhood sunburn) reduced the estimated
degree of protection (odds ratio = 0.56; p = 0.08), reflecting their
likely participation in the causal pathway. Only blond/red hair color
and childhood sunburns were independently associated with risk of
malignant melanoma; adjustment for those 2 covariates gave an estimated
per allele odds ratio of 0.55 (p = 0.05) for the F374L variant.

.0009
OCULOCUTANEOUS ALBINISM, TYPE IV
SLC45A2, 1-BP DEL, 1121T

In 2 Brazilian sibs with oculocutaneous albinism type IV (606574),
Lezirovitz et al. (2006) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion
(1121delT) in exon 5 of the MATP gene, resulting in a frameshift and
premature termination of the protein at codon 397. One of the affected
sibs also had sensorineural deafness (DFNB1; 220290) associated with a
homozygous mutation in the GJB2 gene (121011.0005). Lezirovitz et al.
(2006) concluded that congenital deafness and oculocutaneous albinism
due to mutations in 2 different genes as seen in their Brazilian family
suggested a similar coincident inheritance of 2 separate recessive
disorders in the Sephardic family reported by Ziprkowski and Adam (1964)
(see 220900).

300090	TITLE *300090 SIGNAL SEQUENCE RECEPTOR, DELTA; SSR4
;;TRANSLOCON-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, DELTA SUBUNIT; TRAPD
DESCRIPTION Brenner et al. (1997) described 2 novel genes that are located in the
Xq28 region, are driven by a bidirectional promoter located between
them, and encode proteins involved in unrelated biochemical pathways
located in different compartments of the cell. Translocon-associated
protein (TRAP)-delta subunit is assumed to be involved in the secretion
of proteins. The highest concentration of TRAP-delta transcripts was
observed in pancreas, where large quantities of lipases, nucleases, and
proteases are synthesized and secreted. The second gene, IDH3G (300089),
encodes the gamma subunit of the NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate
dehydrogenase, which is involved in the energy metabolism of the cell.
Correspondingly, the highest expression levels are in tissues with
increased energy turnover, like heart, skeletal muscle, and brain. IDH3G
and TRAP-delta were found to be arranged in a compact head-to-head
manner. The nontranscribed intergenic region represents only 133 bp and
is embedded in a CpG island. Brenner et al. (1997) concluded that the
CpG island functions as a bidirectional promoter to initiate the
transcription of both functionally unrelated genes with quite distinct
expression patterns. The authors showed that in rat and mouse this area
is similarly compact, representing less than 249 bp in rat and not more
than 164 bp in mouse. In both species, this intergenic region is
embedded in a CpG island and is highly conserved, with nucleotide
identity values ranging from 70.1% between human and rat to 92.6%
between mouse and rat.

615323	TITLE *615323 JOSEPHIN DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; JOSD1
;;KIAA0063
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

JOSD1 belongs to a family of Josephin domain-containing deubiquitinating
enzymes related to ATXN3 (607047). JOSD1 is activated by
monoubiquitination and functions in cytoskeletal dynamics, cell
motility, and endocytosis (Seki et al., 2013).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated KG-1 human
immature myeloid cell line cDNA library, (Nomura et al., 1994) obtained
a partial JOSD1 clone, which they designated KIAA0063. The 3-prime
untranslated region contains an Alu element and its 202-amino acid
sequence was predicted to include a transmembrane domain. Northern blot
analysis detected JOSD1 in all human tissues and cell lines examined.

Seki et al. (2013) stated that the deduced 202-amino acid JOSD1 protein
is made up almost entirely of an approximately 180-amino acid Josephin
catalytic domain, including a catalytic cys36. Western blot analysis
detected robust Josd1 expression in all mouse tissues examined: anterior
and posterior brain, heart, kidney, liver, skeletal muscle, and spleen.
In transfected HEK293 cells, epitope- or fluorescence-tagged JOSD1
localized predominantly at the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic puncta.
In fractionated cells, JOSD1 localized to the cytoskeletal, cytosolic,
and membrane fractions, but not to the nuclear fraction. Database
analysis revealed 2 JOSD genes in vertebrates, JOSD1 and JOSD2 (615324),
but only a single Josd gene in C. elegans and Drosophila.

GENE FUNCTION

Seki et al. (2013) found that recombinant human JOSD1 deubiquitinated a
monoubiquitinated probe. However, monoubiquitinated JOSD1 showed
activity against both lys48- and lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains,
which are associated with protein degradative and regulatory pathways,
respectively. A substantial proportion of JOSD1 appeared to be
monoubiquitinated in cultured cells. In contrast, JOSD2 did not require
monoubiquitination for activity against either lys48- or lys63-linked
ubiquitin chains. Monoubiquitination of JOSD1 caused its relocalization
from the cytoskeletal fraction to the membrane fraction in transfected
cells. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that catalytically inactive JOSD1
altered membrane dynamics and cell motility; monoubiquitinated and
catalytic active JOSD1 also enhanced macropinocytosis and suppressed
clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Seki et al. (2013)
concluded that the activity of JOSD1 is regulated by monoubiquitination
and that it has a role in membrane dynamics and endocytosis.

MAPPING

By PCR of a human-rodent hybrid panel, Nomura et al. (1994) mapped the
JOSD1 gene to chromosome 22. Hartz (2013) mapped the JOSD1 gene to
chromosome 22q13.1 based on an alignment of the JOSD1 sequence (GenBank
GENBANK D31884) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

612931	TITLE *612931 PHOSPHOGLYCERATE MUTASE 2; PGAM2
;;PHOSPHOGLYCERATE MUTASE, MUSCLE; PGAMM
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PGAM2 gene encodes muscle phosphoglycerate mutase-2 (EC 5.4.2.1).
PGAM is a dimer containing, in different tissues, various proportions of
a slow-migrating muscle (M) isoenzyme and a fast-migrating brain (B)
isoenzyme (PGAMB, PGAM1; 172250) (DiMauro et al., 1986).

CLONING

Shanske et al. (1987) isolated a full-length cDNA specifying the
muscle-specific subunit of PGAM. The deduced 253-residue protein was
clearly related to yeast Pgam and to bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM;
613896). Genomic Southern analysis with this cDNA suggested the presence
of a large PGAM gene family in the human genome, while Northern analysis
demonstrated tissue-specific transcription of the specific PGAM gene.
The B subunit is predominantly expressed in red blood cells, liver, and
brain, the M subunit in muscle, and both subunits in heart.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsujino et al. (1989) found that the PGAM2 gene spans 2.83 kb and has a
3-exon/2-intron structure similar to that of the BPGM gene, in that the
second intron in both genes is localized at precisely the same position.
Comparison with other muscle-specific enzyme genes showed a conserved
9-bp element (GGGGCTGGG) in the 5-prime flanking region that may be
associated with the expression of genes encoding muscle-specific
enzymes.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Mattei et al. (1989) mapped the PGAMM gene to
chromosome 7p13-p12; see Castella-Escola et al. (1990). The B subunit of
PGAM maps to 10q25, and the BPGM maps to 7q22-q34.

Edwards et al. (1989) used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to
amplify the human PGAM2 sequence in rodent/human hybrid DNA and thereby
map the gene to human chromosome 7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 5 patients with muscle phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency, also known
as glycogen storage disease X (GSD10; 261670), Tsujino et al. (1993)
identified 3 homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the PGAM2
gene (612931.0001-612931.0003). Four of the 5 patients were African
American; the fifth was Italian. All had severely decreased PGAM2
activity (2 to 6% of normal values).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE X
PGAM2, TRP78TER

In 3 unrelated African American patients with glycogen storage disease X
(GSD10; 261670), Tsujino et al. (1993) identified a homozygous G-to-A
transition in the PGAM2 gene, resulting in a trp78-to-ter (W78X)
substitution. Two of the patients had previously been described by
Bresolin et al. (1983) and Kissel et al. (1985). The third patient, a
17-year-old girl, complained of exercise intolerance since age 8 years;
intense exertion caused pain and cramps in the exercising muscles.
During episodes of myalgia, increases of serum creatine kinase were
documented but there was no pigmenturia. A brother complained of similar
exercise intolerance with cramps and had persistently elevated serum
creatine kinase. A fourth patient, also African American, was a compound
heterozygote for W78X and G89A (612931.0002). PGAM2 activities in all
patients were decreased to 2.1 to 6% of normal values.

GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE X
PGAM2, GLU89ALA

In a 30-year-old African American man with GSD10 (261670), Tsujino et
al. (1993) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
PGAM2 gene: W78X (612931.0001) and an A-to-C transversion resulting in a
glu89-to-ala (E89A) substitution. He reported a history of pigmenturia
that appeared a few hours after he ran a race. Serum creatine kinase was
greatly elevated and myoglobin was demonstrated in the urine. He
developed renal failure that required hemodialysis. He had had 2 similar
episodes, at ages 21 and 22 years, both after strenuous exercise. PGAM2
activity was 2.6% of normal values.

.0003
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE X
PGAM2, ARG90TRP

In a 24-year-old Italian man, the first reported Caucasian with muscle
phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency (GSD10; 261670) (Vita et al., 1990),
Tsujino et al. (1993) demonstrated homozygosity for a C-to-T transition
in the PGAM2 gene, resulting in an arg90-to-trp (R90W) substitution. He
had episodes of myalgia, weakness, and pigmenturia after brief intense
exercise. PGAM2 activity was 6% of normal values.

.0004
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE X
PGAM2, GLY97ASP

In a Japanese family with partial PGAM2 deficiency (GSD10; 261670),
Hadjigeorgiou et al. (1999) identified a 209G-A transition in the PGAM2
gene, resulting in the substitution of a highly conserved glycine at
codon 97 with aspartic acid (G97D). Two family members heterozygous for
the G97D mutation presented with exercise intolerance and muscle cramps.
In at least 2 families, manifesting heterozygotes had previously been
described (Tsujino et al., 1993; Bresolin et al., 1983).

194531	TITLE *194531 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 7; ZNF7
;;KOX4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

On the basis of sequence similarity in the repeated zinc finger domain,
Lania et al. (1990) identified and characterized 2 human cDNA clones,
designated ZNF7 and ZNF8, both of which encoded proteins containing
potential finger-like nucleic acid binding motifs. The predicted
686-amino acid ZNF7 protein contains 15 zinc finger domains that
comprise nearly 70% of the protein. Northern blot analysis revealed that
ZNF7 is expressed as 2.8- and 3.3-kb mRNAs in a variety of human cell
lines.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Lania et al. (1990) localized ZNF7 to 8q24 and
ZNF8 to 20q13. Bray et al. (1991) likewise mapped ZNF7 to 8qter by
chromosomal in situ suppression hybridization with fluorescent probe
detection. Bray et al. (1991) determined that the genomic locus
designated ZNF7 corresponds to KOX4 in the set of 30 zinc finger
protein-encoding cDNAs (KOX1-KOX30) previously isolated from a T-cell
library (Thiesen, 1990). They concluded that the human genome contains
many, probably several hundred, zinc finger genes with consensus his/cys
(H/C) link regions.

Huebner et al. (1993) confirmed the assignment of ZNF7 to chromosome
8q24 by analysis of rodent/human somatic cell hybrids and by in situ
hybridization. They showed that ZNF7 is telomeric to the MYC locus
(190080).

NCK-INTERACTING KINASE; NIK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Activation of the JNK (see 601158) pathway by a variety of environmental
and extracellular stimuli is mediated by multiple STE20-like protein
kinases (e.g., STK25, 602255). By screening a human macrophage cDNA
library with degenerate PCR primers to sequences of STE20 family
members, Yao et al. (1999) obtained a novel cDNA that they termed HGK
(for HPK1/GCK-like kinase). The HGK cDNA encodes a 1,165-amino acid
protein. Its N terminus has a catalytic kinase domain with 11 kinase
subdomains. It shares 47% and 48% amino acid sequence identity to the
catalytic domain of HPK1 (601983) and GCK (603166), respectively. The
authors identified 2 HGK isoforms, one of which has no proline-rich
domains, and another, longer variant that contains such domains and
appears to be expressed in brain only. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of 3 HGK transcripts of approximately 4.6, 6.5, and 8.5 kb in
heart, brain, skeletal muscle, pancreas, placenta, liver, lung, and
kidney. By Western blot analysis with a polyclonal antibody, Yao et al.
(1999) found that the 130-kD protein is expressed in multiple cell
lines. Expression of HGK in transfected cell lines resulted in strong
JNK activation and, in turn, c-jun transcriptional activity. HGK-induced
JNK activation was inhibited by dominant-negative MKK4 (MAP2K4; 601335),
MKK7 (MAP2K7; 603014), and TAK1 (MAP3K7; 602614) mutants. TNFA (191160)
also stimulated HGK kinase activity.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an RNA interference-based screen, Tang et al. (2006) found 4
negative regulators of insulin-responsive glucose transport in mouse
adipocytes: Pctk1 (311550), Pftk1 (610679), Ikbka (CHUK; 600664), and
Map4k4. Map4k4 suppressed expression of adipogenic transcription
factors, Cebpa (116897), Cebpb (189965), and Pparg (601487), and it
suppressed surface expression of Glut4 (SLC2A4; 138190), resulting in
attenuated membrane hexose transport activity. Depletion of Map4k4 by
RNA interference early in differentiation enhanced adipogenesis and
triglyceride deposition; in fully differentiated adipocytes, loss of
Map4k4 upregulated Glut4 expression. Conversely, conditions that
inhibited adipogenesis, such as Tnfa treatment or Pparg depletion,
markedly upregulated Map4k4. Tang et al. (2006) concluded that
MAP4K4-dependent signaling inhibited PPARG-responsive gene expression,
adipogenesis, and insulin-stimulated glucose transport.

Aouadi et al. (2009) reported the engineering of
beta-1,3-D-glucan-encapsulated siRNA particles (GeRPs) as efficient oral
delivery vehicles that potently silenced genes in mouse macrophages in
vitro and in vivo. Oral gavage of mice with GeRPs containing as little
as 20 micrograms per kilogram siRNA directed against TNF-alpha (191160)
depleted its mRNA in macrophages recovered from peritoneum, spleen,
liver, and lung, and lowered serum TNF-alpha levels. Screening with
GeRPs for inflammation genes revealed that Map4k4 is a mediator of
cytokine expression. Importantly, silencing Map4k4 in macrophages in
vivo protected mice from lipopolysaccharide-induced lethality by
inhibiting TNF-alpha and interleukin-1-beta (147720) production. Aouadi
et al. (2009) concluded that their technology defined a strategy for
oral delivery of siRNA to attenuate inflammatory responses in human
disease.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the
MAP4K4 gene, which they termed KIAA0687, to chromosome 2.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Three-prime, 5-prime-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is the
intracellular second messenger regulating phototransduction in mammals.
The level of cGMP in photoreceptor cells is controlled by the
cGMP-hydrolyzing enzyme cGMP phosphodiesterase and the cGMP-producing
enzyme guanylate cyclase. Two major forms of cyclases are recognized,
the particulate (membrane) and the soluble forms. The membrane guanylate
cyclases are composed of large single subunits consisting of a
ligand-binding N-terminal segment, a transmembrane domain, an internal
protein kinase homology region, and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The
highly homologous membrane guanylate cyclases include NPR1 (natriuretic
peptide receptor A; 108960), NPR2 (natriuretic peptide receptor B;
108961), and NPR3 (natriuretic peptide receptor C; 108962). Shyjan et
al. (1992) cloned a human photoreceptor guanylate cyclase, called retGC
(GUCY2D). The predicted protein sequence is closely related to the other
membrane guanylate cyclases, and all structural domains are well
conserved. However, expressed photoreceptor guanylate cyclase is not
activated by natriuretic peptides.

Yang et al. (1995) cloned 2 guanylyl cyclases, Gucy2e and Gucyf
(300041), from a rat eye cDNA library. These 2 rat genes are expressed
in retina. The mouse and rat Gucy2e genes are homologs of human GUCY2D
(Scott, 2009).

The human GUCY2D protein is 87% identical to its mouse counterpart
(Perrault et al., 1996).

Duda et al. (1999) stated that GUCY2D, which they called rod outer
segment membrane guanylate cyclase (ROS-GC1), was the original member of
the subfamily of membrane guanylate cyclases with 2 Ca(2+) switches
referred to as calcium-regulated modules (CRMs) and designated CRM1 and
CRM2. These are separately located within the intracellular domain of
the cyclase. CRM1 switches on the enzyme at nanomolar concentrations of
calcium ion and is linked with phototransduction; CRM2 stimulates at
micromolar calcium ion concentrations and is predicted to be linked with
retinal synaptic activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Perrault et al. (1996) determined that the human GUCY2D gene is 16 kb
long and contains 20 exons.

MAPPING

Oliveira et al. (1994) used PCR analysis of human-rodent somatic cell
hybrids to map the GUCY2D locus to chromosome 17. The assignment was
confirmed and regionalized to chromosome 17p13.1 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

By interspecific backcross analysis, Yang et al. (1996) mapped the mouse
Gucy2e gene to chromosome 11 in a region of syntenic homology to human
17p13 known to contain loci for autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa
(600059) and Leber congenital amaurosis (204000).

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation of mouse retinal extracts, Azadi et al. (2010)
found that Rd3 (180040) bound Gc1 and Gc2. They confirmed interaction of
Rd3 with Gc1 in transfected HEK293 cells. A short C-terminal segment of
Gc1 was required for Rd3 binding. When expressed alone in COS-7 cells,
Rd3 colocalized with the endosomal recycling marker Rab11 (see RAB11A;
605570) in a pattern characteristic of intracellular vesicles, whereas
Gc1 localized in a perinuclear distribution characteristic of
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When coexpressed, Gc1 was exported from the
ER to endosomal vesicles containing Rd3 and Rab11. Retinal extracts from
Rd3 mutant mice lacked Gc1 protein expression and showed reduced Gc2
protein expression compared with wildtype. The GC-activating proteins
Gcap1 (GUCA1A; 600364) and Gcap2 (GUCA1B; 602275) also showed reduced
expression in Rd3 mice, as well as mislocalization to the inner segment
of photoreceptor cells. Azadi et al. (2010) proposed that RD3 may be an
accessory protein required for vesicle trafficking of GCs from inner to
outer segments of rod and cone cells and that it may modulate GC
enzymatic activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Leber Congenital Amaurosis 1

By homozygosity mapping in consanguineous families of North African
origin, Camuzat et al. (1995) mapped a gene for Leber congenital
amaurosis (LCA1; 204000) to 17p13.1. Camuzat et al. (1996) provided
evidence of genetic heterogeneity, finding that LCA1 accounted for 8/15
LCA families in their series. Based on 3 key recombinants, Perrault et
al. (1996) were able to reduce the interval encompassing the LCA1 gene
to a critical region of less than 1 cM. Starting from flanking markers,
they ordered 12 YAC clones on 17p13.1. Of the candidate genes expressed
in the retina and located on chromosome 17, none mapped to these YACs
except the gene for retinal guanylate cyclase. Perrault et al. (1996)
found 2 missense mutations (600179.0001; 600179.0004) and 2 frameshift
mutations (600179.0002; 600179.0003) associated with LCA1. As specific
guanylate cyclase activating proteins (GCAPs) are required for retinal
guanylate cyclase activity, the study of Perrault et al. (1996) raised
the question of whether some LCA cases unlinked to 17p13 could be
accounted for by mutations in GCAP genes, which include the GUCA1 gene
(600364) on 6p21.1.

Perrault et al. (2000) screened the whole coding sequence of the RETGC1
gene in 118 patients affected with Leber congenital amaurosis. They
found 22 different mutations in 24 unrelated families originating from
various countries. All RETGC1 mutations consistently caused congenital
cone-rod dystrophy. RETGC1 is an essential protein implicated in the
phototransduction cascade, especially in the recovery of the dark state
after the excitation process of photoreceptor cells by light
stimulation. Perrault et al. (2000) postulated that the RETGC1 mutations
hinder the restoration of the basal level of cGMP of cone and rod
photoreceptor cells, leading to a situation equivalent to consistent
light exposure during photoreceptor development, explaining the severity
of the visual disorder at birth.

- Cone-Rod Dystrophy 6

Leber congenital amaurosis is inherited as an autosomal recessive.
Kelsell et al. (1998) demonstrated that mutations in the GUCY2D gene are
responsible also for a dominant form of cone-rod dystrophy, which they
referred to as CORD6 (601777).

Payne et al. (2001) studied 40 patients: 27 with autosomal dominant
macular dystrophy and 13 with autosomal dominant cone or cone-rod
dystrophy. Two patients were found to carry the R838C mutation
(600179.0006) and 1 the R838H mutation (600179.0008). Combining these
results with those of Kelsell et al. (1998), Payne et al. (2001)
estimated the frequency of mutations at codon 838 of the GUCY2D gene
among patients with autosomal dominant macular cone or cone-rod
dystrophy to be 6.7%. However, if only the 3 mutations in the 13
patients with cone or cone-rod dystrophy are considered, the estimated
frequency of mutations is 23%.

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family segregating
autosomal recessive CORD mapping to chromosome 17p13.3, Ugur Iseri et
al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a missense mutation (600179.0010)
in the GUCY2D gene.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Wilkie et al. (2000) studied the biochemical effects of various
mutations at codon 838 in RETGC1: the 3 disease-causing substitutions
(R838C, 600179.0006; R838H, 600179.0008 and R838S, 600179.0005) and 4
artificial mutations (R838A, R838E, R838L, and R838K). Assay of
GCAP1-stimulated cyclase activity in vitro showed that, compared with
wildtype, R838E, R838L and R838K had only low activity, whereas R838A,
R838C, R838H, and R838S had activity equal to or greater than wildtype
at low Ca(2+) concentrations as well as a higher apparent affinity for
GCAP1 than did wildtype. The Ca(2+) sensitivity of the GCAP1 activation
was also altered with marked residual activity at high Ca(2+), the
effect increasing in this order: wildtype, R838C, R838H, R838A, R838S.
Within the photoreceptor, this would result in a failure to inactivate
cyclase activity at high physiologic Ca(2+) concentrations. Among the 3
disease-associated mutations, the effect correlated directly with
disease severity. The wildtype and R838H mutant displayed a difference
in pH sensitivity, with the mutant showing a higher specific activity
with pH greater than 6.0. Site 838 is in the dimerization domain that
forms a coiled-coil in the active protein. A computer-aided structure
prediction of this region indicated that R838 in the wildtype breaks the
structure at 4 helical turns, and there is an increasing tendency for
the structure to continue for further turns in the order R838C;
R838H,S,K; R838E; R838A; R838L.

Downes et al. (2001) described the phenotype and electrophysiologic
responses in 4 British families, 3 with an R838C mutation and 1 with an
R838H mutation in the GUCY2D gene. Although subjects had lifelong poor
vision in bright light, a major reduction in visual acuity did not occur
in most of them until after their late teens. Fundus abnormalities were
confined to the central macula, and increasing central atrophy was noted
with age. Electrophysiologic testing revealed a marked loss of cone
function with only minimal rod involvement, even in older subjects. The
authors concluded that the phenotype associated with autosomal dominant
cone-rod dystrophy with either an R838C or R838H mutation in GUCY2D was
distinctive, with predominantly cone system involvement. There was some
variation in severity within the 3 families with the R838C mutation.
Families with the R838C or R838H mutations had a much milder phenotype
than the families previously described with the E837D/R838S mutation
(600179.0005) in GUCY2D.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 1
GUCY2D, PHE565SER

In all sibs with Leber congenital amaurosis (204000) in 2 consanguineous
Arab-Algerian families, Perrault et al. (1996) found homozygosity for a
T-to-C transition in exon 8 at nucleotide 1767 of the GUC2D gene. The
nucleotide change converted phenylalanine to serine in the protein. The
substitution of an aromatic nonpolar amino acid by an uncharged polar
amino acid within the kinase-like domain markedly altered the
hydrophobicity of the protein and was expected to affect its stability
severely. Perrault et al. (1996) reported the predicted change at amino
acid 589 (F589S), but Duda et al. (1999) stated that the correct
position is 565.

Duda et al. (1999) showed that the bovine F514S mutation, which
corresponds to the human F565S mutation, severely damages the intrinsic
cyclase activity of ROS-GC1 and inactivates its CRM1 switch but does not
affect the CRM2 switch. In addition, on the basis of the established
modulatory features of ROS-GC1, Duda et al. (1999) predicted that in 2
other forms of Leber congenital amaurosis involving deletion of
nucleotide 460C (600179.0002) or 693C (600179.0003), there is a
frameshift in the GUCY2D gene that results in nonexpression of the
cyclase.

LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 1
GUCY2D, 1-BP DEL, 460C

In a Jewish Sephardi family of Tunisian origin, Perrault et al. (1996)
found that members with Leber congenital amaurosis (204000) were
homozygous for a 1-bp deletion (460delC) in exon 2 at nucleotide 460 of
GUC2D that modified the downstream amino acid sequence, abolished a SmaI
restriction site, and resulted in a premature translation termination at
codon 165.

.0003
LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 1
GUCY2D, 1-BP DEL, 693C

In members of an Arab family of Tunisian origin affected with Leber
congenital amaurosis (204000), Perrault et al. (1996) observed a
homozygous 1-bp deletion in exon 2 at nucleotide 693 (693delC) of GUC2D
that modified the downstream amino acid sequence, created a BspMI
restriction site, and resulted in a premature translation termination at
codon 215.

.0004
LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 1
GUCY2D, ALA52SER

In all sibs with Leber congenital amaurosis (204000) in a consanguineous
Arab Tunisian family, Perrault et al. (1996) found homozygosity for a
G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 227 of GUC2D converting an alanine
into a serine (A52S). Heterozygosity for the same mutation was detected
in affected members of a family of Basque ancestry. As the same base
change was detected in 2 of 100 controls, it was difficult to decide
whether this was a disease-causing mutation or a rare polymorphism.

.0005
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 6
GUCY2D, GLU837ASP AND ARG838SER

In a 4-generation British family with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD6;
601777), Kelsell et al. (1997) showed linkage between the disorder and
17p13-p12. Cone-rod dystrophy in this family displayed an early onset,
with loss of central vision reported before 7 years of age and
peripheral field loss by the fourth decade. A notable feature was marked
photophobia, particularly when dark-adapted. Funduscopy showed a 'bull's
eye' maculopathy early in the disease, with later involvement of the
peripheral retina. Electroretinography showed no detectable cone
responses early in the disease, with progressive abnormality of rod
responses appearing later. Kelsell et al. (1998) studied the GUC2D gene
because it maps to the same chromosomal area. Direct sequence analysis
of all 18 coding exons of the gene demonstrated a heterozygous
alteration in exon 13: 2584G-C, predicted to cause a glu837-to-asp
(E837D) amino acid substitution.

Gregory-Evans et al. (2000) stated that further analysis of the family
originally studied by Kelsell et al. (1997) led to a reappraisal of the
mutation, redefined as glu837 to asp/arg838 to ser. They described the
clinical features in this family (see 601777).

.0006
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 6
GUCY2D, ARG838CYS

Kelsell et al. (1998) found another heterozygous mutation of the GUC2D
gene in a family with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD6; 601777) with features
somewhat different from that of the original CORD6 family described in
600179.0005. In 3 families carrying this second mutation (arg838 to cys;
R838C), affected individuals, although aware of poor vision in bright
light from an early age, suffered loss of central vision in the late
second or third decade, later than was found in the original family with
the E837D mutation. The fundus appearance of affected members of these 3
families was, however, very similar to that of the original family.
Electrophysiologic testing revealed marked loss of photopic function by
the mid-teens, with scotopic function becoming compromised later.
Genealogic studies failed to show a relationship between the 3 families.
The R838C amino acid substitution resulted from a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 2585. Alignment of the portion of membrane-bound guanylate
cyclases in this domain, represented by codons 809 to 871, showed that
both glu837 and arg838 are fully conserved.

In 38 affected members of a large multigenerational family from eastern
Tennessee with autosomal dominant progressive cone dystrophy, originally
described by Small and Gehrs (1996), Udar et al. (2003) identified the
R838C mutation in the GUCY2D gene. The mutation was also detected in 2
unaffected family members, but was not found in 22 additional unaffected
family members or 200 control chromosomes.

.0007
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 6
GUCY2D, GLU837ASP, ARG838CYS, AND THR839MET

Perrault et al. (1998) found a mutation in the GUC2D gene in a family
with autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy (CORD6; 601777). Six members
of 3 generations were affected with an early cone dysfunction
characterized by decreased vision acuity, with severe color
dyschromatopsia and photophobia, during the first decade of life. At
that stage, ophthalmoscopic examinations were not specific. By contrast,
electrophysiologic testing revealed marked loss of photopic function,
with scotopic function relatively well preserved, and the visual field
showed a consistent central scotoma. During the second and third
decades, visual acuity decreased dramatically, and the color vision
defect was confined to achromatopsia, hampering normal schooling and
professional initiation. After the age of 40 years, peripheral visual
field loss and progressive night blindness were observed, and the ERG
became unrecordable. A maximum lod score of 2.71 at recombination
fraction zero was found for 2 markers in the region of the GUC2D gene.
Affected members of the family were found to be heterozygous for a
complex mutational event involving 3 consecutive missense mutations in
exon 13: (1) a G-to-C transversion at nucleotide 2584, changing a
glutamate to an aspartate at codon 837 (E837D); (2) a C-to-T transition
at nucleotide 2585, changing an arginine to a cysteine at codon 838
(R838C); and (3) a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 2589, changing a
threonine to a methionine at codon 839 (T839M). This triple mutation has
the earmarks of a gene conversion event.

.0008
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 6
GUCY2D, ARG838HIS

In a patient with cone-rod dystrophy-6 (CORD6; 601777), Weigell-Weber et
al. (2000) detected a G-to-A transition of the GCGC stretch at position
2586 in exon 13 of the GUCY2D gene, resulting in a conservative
arg838-to-his (R838H) substitution.

In 8 affected members of a Caucasian American family with cone
dystrophy, Udar et al. (2003) identified the R838H mutation in the
GUCY2D gene. The mutation was not found in 5 unaffected family members
or 200 control chromosomes.

.0009
LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 1
GUCY2D, 1-BP DEL, 2943G

Hanein et al. (2002) identified a homozygous 2943G deletion (2943delG)
in the GUCY2D gene in 3 unrelated and nonconsanguineous Leber congenital
amaurosis (204000) families of Finnish origin, suggesting a founder
effect. No linkage disequilibrium was found using polymorphic markers
flanking the GUCY2D gene, supporting the view that the mutation is very
ancient. Haplotype studies and Bayesian calculation pointed the founder
mutation to 150 generations (i.e., 3,000 years ago).

.0010
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 6
GUCY2D, ILE949THR

In 6 affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family segregating
autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy-6 (CORD6; 601777), Ugur Iseri et
al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 2846T-C transition in exon 15
of the GUCY2D gene, resulting in an ile949-to-thr (I949T) substitution
at a highly conserved residue in the catalytic domain. The mutation was
not detected in 186 control chromosomes. Ugur Iseri et al. (2010)
predicted that substitution of hydrophobic isoleucine with polar
threonine in this region would interfere with proper folding of the
helical segment and affect function of the catalytic domain, and they
proposed that the I949T mutation does not abolish but only decreases
enzymatic activity.

611432	TITLE *611432 DEDICATOR OF CYTOKINESIS 8; DOCK8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DOCK8 is a member of the DOCK180-related (DOCK1; 601403) protein family
(Ruusala and Aspenstrom, 2004).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis using CDC42 (116952) as bait, followed by PCR
of a Daudi cell cDNA library, Ruusala and Aspenstrom (2004) cloned
DOCK8. They identified transcripts encoding a 1,701-amino acid protein
with a calculated molecular mass of 190 kD and a 2,031-amino acid
protein. DOCK8 contains the CZH1 and CZH2 domains characteristic of
DOCK180-related proteins and shares 58% amino acid identity with DOCK7.
Northern blot analysis detected an 8-kb transcript in placenta, lung,
kidney, and pancreas with low expression in heart, brain, and skeletal
muscle and a 9-kb transcript with very low expression in placenta, lung,
and kidney. Immunofluorescence localized transiently transfected and
endogenous DOCK8 to the cytoplasm at cell edges in areas undergoing
lamellipodia formation, which increased when cells were treated with
PDGF (see 190040) or fetal calf serum. Transient transfection of a
C-terminal fragment of DOCK8 resulted in formation of vesicular
structures, which also contained filamentous actin, suggesting that
DOCK8 may play a role in the organization of filamentous actin.

By Northern blot analysis of human adult and fetal tissues, Griggs et
al. (2008) detected expression of an 8.0-kb transcript in all tissues
examined, including adult and fetal brain with variable expression in
specific brain regions tested. RT-PCR analysis detected variable
expression of a splice variant containing exon 13a and 14a and a splice
variant containing exon 13b but lacking exon 16.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Ruusala and Aspenstrom (2004) showed that
DOCK8 interacted with GTP- and GDP-bound forms of CDC42, Rac1 (602048)
mutants L61 and N17, and RHOJ (607653) and RHOQ (605857). None of these
interactions was detected using GST pull-down assay, suggesting that the
interaction between DOCK and Rho GTPases may be too transient to allow
stable interaction in this assay.

By quantitative RT-PCR analysis, Zhang et al. (2009) identified DOCK8
expression in monocytes, B cells, and T cells from healthy blood donors.
High levels were found in activated, expanded primary T-cell cultures
and transformed lymphocyte lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Griggs et al. (2008) determined that the DOCK8 gene contains 47 exons
spanning 190 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Griggs et al. (2008) mapped the DOCK8 gene
to chromosome 9p24.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Dominant Mental Retardation 2

Griggs et al. (2008) reported 2 unrelated patients with mental
retardation and developmental disability (MRD2; 614113) associated with
heterozygous disruption of the DOCK8 gene by deletion and by a
translocation breakpoint, respectively. Mapping of the critical region
shared by the 2 patients showed truncation of the longest isoform of
DOCK8. One patient was a 55-year-old man with profound mental
retardation, no speech, mild dysmorphic features, a history of seizures,
and stooped posture. He had a genomic deletion of approximately 230 kb
in subtelomeric 9p. The second patient was a girl with anhidrotic
ectodermal dysplasia (ED1; 305100) previously reported by MacDermot and
Hulten (1990). She carried a de novo balanced translocation
t(X;9)(q13.1;p24), which also interrupted the EDA gene (300451). She was
reported to have delayed speech and psychomotor development, but
attended a special school.

- Autosomal Recessive Hyper-IgE Recurrent Infection Syndrome

In 11 affected individuals from 8 unrelated families with autosomal
recessive hyper-IgE syndrome with recurrent infections (243700), Zhang
et al. (2009) identified homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for
deletions or mutations in the DOCK8 gene (see, e.g.,
611432.0001-611432.0005). Patients had recurrent and severe bacterial,
viral, and fungal infections, atopic dermatitis, and food and
environmental allergies. Several developed viral-associated carcinomas.
Laboratory studies showed decreased levels of T cells, variable decrease
in B cells, and increased serum IgE. All the DOCK8 mutations resulted in
loss of protein function. DOCK8 protein was not detected in primary T
cell cultures or transformed lymphocyte lines from all 11 patients
tested. CD8 T cells showed impaired proliferation and activation, with
normal cytotoxic activity.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPER-IgE RECURRENT INFECTION SYNDROME, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
DOCK8, LYS405ARG

In 2 Mexican sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with autosomal
recessive hyper-IgE syndrome (243700), Zhang et al. (2009) identified a
homozygous 1214A-G transition in the DOCK8 gene, resulting in a
lys405-to-arg (K405R) substitution. The patients had atopic dermatitis,
recurrent bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, and multiple food and
environmental allergies. One died at age 18 years. Patient T-cell
cultures showed minimal amounts of a mutant protein, and CD8 T cells
showed poor expansion and activation. However, CD8 T cell cytotoxic
function appeared to be normal, and CD4 T cells showed normal
proliferation.

.0002
HYPER-IgE RECURRENT INFECTION SYNDROME, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
DOCK8, EX10-23, DEL

In a 6-year-old Yemeni girl, born of consanguineous parents, with
autosomal recessive hyper-IgE syndrome (243700), Zhang et al. (2009)
identified a homozygous large deletion (921_2765del) in the DOCK8 gene,
resulting in the deletion of exons 10 through 23. She had atopic
dermatitis, recurrent bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, and food
and environmental allergies. Patient T-cell cultures showed minimal
amounts of a truncated mutant protein, and CD8 T cells showed poor
expansion and activation. However, CD8 T cell cytotoxic function
appeared to be normal, and CD4 T cells showed normal proliferation.

.0003
HYPER-IgE RECURRENT INFECTION SYNDROME, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
DOCK8, EX5-24, DEL

In a Lebanese boy, born of consanguineous parents, with autosomal
recessive hyper-IgE syndrome (243700), Zhang et al. (2009) identified a
homozygous large deletion (426_3017del) in the DOCK8 gene, resulting in
the deletion of exons 5 through 24. He had atopic dermatitis, recurrent
bacterial and viral infections, and multiple food and environmental
allergies. He died of metastatic anal squamous cell carcinoma at age 21
years. The DOCK8 protein was not detected in primary T-cell cultures.

.0004
HYPER-IgE RECURRENT INFECTION SYNDROME, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
DOCK8, 1-BP DEL, 3290C

In a 13-year-old Caucasian girl with autosomal recessive hyper-IgE
syndrome (243700), Zhang et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygous
frameshift mutations in the DOCK8 gene: a 1-bp deletion (c.3290delC) and
an 8-bp insertion (c.3303_3304insTGGCTGCT; 611432.0005).

609157	TITLE *609157 NODAL MODULATOR 1; NOMO1
;;PM5, TELOMERIC COPY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a melanoma cDNA library using the metal-binding domain of
human fibroblast collagenase (MMP1; 120353) as probe, Templeton et al.
(1992) cloned NOMO1, which they designated PM5. Northern blot analysis
detected a 4.0-kb transcript in both normal and malignant colorectal
tissues.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Loftus et al. (1999) mapped the PM5 gene to a
region of chromosome 16p13.1-p11.2 that shows a high degree of gene
duplication. Scott (2004) mapped 3 copies of the PM5 gene, including
NOMO1, within this region. The NOMO1 gene maps centromeric to the BFAR
gene and telomeric to the KIAA0251 gene.

;;UDP-N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINE:POLYPEPTIDE BETA-N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINYL TRANSFERASE;;
GlcNAc TRANSFERASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) catalyzes the
addition of a single N-acetylglucosamine in O-glycosidic linkage to
serine or threonine residues. Since both phosphorylation and
glycosylation compete for similar serine or threonine residues, the 2
processes may compete for sites, or they may alter the substrate
specificity of nearby sites by steric or electrostatic effects (Lubas et
al., 1997).

CLONING

Haltiwanger et al. (1992) purified rat liver OGT and determined that it
has a molecular mass of 340 kD. They proposed that OGT exists as a
heterotrimeric complex with 2 subunits of 110 kD and 1 of 78 kD.
However, using rabbit OGT, Lubas et al. (1997) analyzed the proteolytic
fingerprint of both polypeptides and found that the 2 are related. They
suggested that the 78-kD band is a proteolytic product of the 110-kD
polypeptide or the product of an alternative translation start site.
Kreppel et al. (1997) cloned rat cDNAs encoding the 110-kD subunit.
Immunofluorescence of human cells expressing rat OGT indicated that OGT
is present in both the nucleus and cytosol.

By searching an EST database with the partial protein sequence of rabbit
OGT, Lubas et al. (1997) identified human and C. elegans OGT cDNAs. The
predicted 920-amino acid human protein contains 9 tetratricopeptide
repeats and a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal. HeLa cells
expressing OGT did not survive well during prolonged incubations,
suggesting that this protein may be toxic to the cells. Southern blot
analysis indicated that a single OGT gene is present in humans. Northern
blot analysis revealed that OGT is expressed as multiple transcripts
that are present in different amounts in various human tissues, with the
highest levels of expression in pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein glycosylation is a widespread and
reversible posttranslational modification in eukaryotic cells.
Intracellular glycosylation by the addition of N-acetylglucosamine to
serine and threonine is catalyzed by OGT. This 'O-GlcNAcylation' of
intracellular proteins can occur on phosphorylation sites, and has been
implicated in controlling gene transcription, neurofilament assembly,
and the emergence of diabetes and neurologic disease. To study OGT
function in vivo, Shafi et al. (2000) used gene-targeting approaches in
male embryonic stem cells. They found that OGT mutagenesis requires a
strategy that retains an intact OGT gene as accomplished by using
Cre-loxP recombination, because a deletion of the OGT gene results in
loss of embryonic stem cell viability. OGT RNA expression in mice was
comparatively high among most cell types, with lower levels in the
pancreas. Segregation of OGT alleles in the mouse germline revealed that
intact OGT alleles are required for completion of embryogenesis. These
studies illustrated the necessity of conditional gene-targeting
approaches in the mutagenesis and study of essential X-linked genes, and
indicated that OGT participation in intracellular glycosylation is
essential for embryonic stem cell viability and for mouse ontogeny.

Transcription factors and RNA polymerase II can be modified by O-GlcNAc
monosaccharides at serine or threonine residues, yet the precise
functional roles of this modification are largely unknown. Yang et al.
(2002) showed that OGT, the enzyme that catalyzes this posttranslational
modification, interacts with a histone deacetylase complex by binding to
the corepressor Sin3A (607776). Functionally, OGT and Sin3A
cooperatively repress transcription in parallel with histone
deacetylation. The authors proposed that Sin3A targets OGT to promoters
to inactivate transcription factors and RNA polymerase II by O-GlcNAc
modification, which acts in concert with histone deacetylation to
promote gene silencing in an efficient and specific manner.

Zhang et al. (2003) demonstrated that the mammalian 26S proteasome could
be inhibited by Ogt-mediated modification, resulting in inhibited
proteolysis of the transcription factor Sp1 (189906) and a hydrophobic
test peptide. The Rpt2 ATPase in the proteasome 19S cap was modified by
O-GlcNAc in vitro and in vivo, and as its modification increased,
proteasome function decreased.

Yang et al. (2008) showed that OGT harbors a previously unrecognized
type of phosphoinositide-binding domain. After induction with insulin,
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate recruits OGT from the nucleus to
the plasma membrane, where the enzyme catalyzes dynamic modification of
the insulin signaling pathway by O-GlcNAc. This results in the
alteration in phosphorylation of key signaling molecules and the
attenuation of insulin signal transduction. Hepatic overexpression of
OGT impairs the expression of insulin-responsive genes and causes
insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Yang et al. (2008) concluded that
their findings identified a molecular mechanism by which nutritional
cues regulate insulin signaling through O-GlcNAc, and underscored the
contribution of this modification to the etiology of insulin resistance
and type 2 diabetes (125853).

Increases in the concentration of circulating glucose activate the
hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and promote the O-glycosylation of
proteins by OGT. Dentin et al. (2008) showed that OGT triggers hepatic
gluconeogenesis through the O-glycosylation of the transducer of
regulated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) 2 (TORC2 or
CRTC2; 608972). CRTC2 was O-glycosylated at sites that normally
sequester CRTC2 in the cytoplasm through a phosphorylation-dependent
mechanism. Decreasing amounts of O-glycosylated CRTC2 by expression of
the deglycosylating enzyme O-GlcNAcase (604039) blocked effects of
glucose on gluconeogenesis, demonstrating the importance of the
hexosamine biosynthetic pathway in the development of glucose
intolerance.

Fujiki et al. (2011) reported that histone H2B (see 609904) is acylated
by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAcylated) at residue S112 by OGT in
vitro and in living cells. Histone GlcNAcylation fluctuated in response
to extracellular glucose through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway.
H2B S112 GlcNAcylation promotes K120 monoubiquitination, in which the
GlcNAc moiety can serve as an anchor for a histone H2B ubiquitin ligase.
H2B S112 GlcNAc was localized to euchromatic areas on fly polytene
chromosomes. In a genomewide analysis, H2B S112 GlcNAcylation sites were
observed widely distributed over chromosomes including transcribed gene
loci, with some sites colocalizing with H2B K120 monoubiquitination.
Fujiki et al. (2011) concluded that H2B S112 GlcNAcylation is a histone
modification that facilitates H2BK120 monoubiquitination, presumably for
transcriptional activation.

Using protein affinity purification, Chen et al. (2013) searched for
functional partners of TET proteins, and found that TET2 (612839) and
TET3 (613555) associates with OGT, an enzyme that by itself catalyzes
the addition of O-GlcNAc onto serine and threonine residues
(O-GlcNAcylation) in vivo. TET2 directly interacts with OGT, which is
important for the chromatin association of OGT in vivo. Although this
specific interaction does not regulate the enzymatic activity of TET2,
it facilitates OGT-dependent histone O-GlcNAcylation. Moreover, OGT
associates with TET2 at transcription start sites. Downregulation of
TET2 reduces the amount of histone 2B S112 GlcNAc marks in vivo, which
are associated with gene transcription regulation. Chen et al. (2013)
concluded that, taken together, their results revealed a TET2-dependent
O-GlcNAcylation of chromatin. The double epigenetic modifications on
both DNA and histones by TET2 and OGT coordinate for the regulation of
gene transcription.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Lazarus et al. (2011) reported 2 crystal structures of human OGT, as a
binary complex with UDP (2.8-angstrom resolution) and as a ternary
complex with UDP and a peptide substrate (1.95-angstrom resolution). The
structures provided clues to the enzyme mechanism, showed how OGT
recognizes target peptide sequences, and revealed the fold of the unique
domain between the 2 halves of the catalytic region.

MAPPING

Shafi et al. (2000) determined that a single copy of the OGT gene is
present in the male genome. By FISH, they mapped the human OGT gene to
Xq13, a region associated with neurologic diseases. By radiation hybrid
analysis, they mapped the mouse homolog to the X chromosome near the
centromere in region D.

611447	TITLE *611447 Y BOX-BINDING PROTEIN 2; YBX2
;;MSY2;;
CSDA3;;
CONTRIN;;
DNA-BINDING PROTEIN C; DBPC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

YBX2 is a germ-cell specific member of the vertebrate Y box family of
nucleic acid-binding proteins (Gu et al., 1998; Tekur et al., 1999).

CLONING

By screening human testis cDNA libraries with mouse Ybx2, followed by
rescreening with 5-prime oligonucleotides from positive clones, Tekur et
al. (1999) cloned YBX2, which they called contrin. The deduced 364-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 38.6 kD and is arginine-
and proline-rich. It shares 69% and 73% amino acid identity with DBPA
(CSDA; 603437) and YB1 (NSEP1; 154030), respectively, and contains an
N-terminal cold-shock domain (CSD), 7 putative phosphorylation sites for
casein kinase II (see CSNK2A1; 115440), 3 potential phosphorylation
sites for protein kinase C, and 2 nuclear localization signals within a
B/A island. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.8-kb transcript in human
testes only. YBX2 shares 93% and 77% amino acid identity with mouse Ybx2
and Xenopus Frgy2, respectively.

Gu et al. (1998) cloned mouse Ybx2, which they called Msy2, and an
alternatively spliced isoform, Msy2a. The deduced 360-amino acid mouse
Msy2 and 282-amino acid Msy2a isoforms have calculated molecular masses
of 38 and 31 kD, respectively. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues
detected Msy2 in mouse germ cells only with expression first detected in
testes from 12-day-old mice, increasing significantly by 17 days, and
reaching maximal levels in 22-day-old mouse testes and persisting into
adulthood. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical studies
detected Msy2 protein in mouse testes and in diplotene-stage and mature
oocytes. By SDS-PAGE, they showed that mouse Msy2 and Msy2a isoforms
migrated at molecular masses of 52 and 48 kD, respectively. This
disparity in migration relative to its true molecular mass is a feature
shared with other Y box proteins.

Using immunohistochemical studies, Kohno et al. (2006) detected highest
DBPC levels in oocytes, spermatogonia, and spermatocytes with moderate
expression in trophoblasts and low levels in lung, heart, adrenal
cortex, and skeletal muscle. In contrast to the restricted distribution
in normal cells, they found upregulated DBPC levels in a variety of
human carcinomas, including adenocarcinomas of the colon (9/10) and
cholangiocellular carcinomas (8/10). All germ cell tumors tested,
including testicular seminomas and ovarian dysgerminomas, showed high
DBPC levels by immunohistochemical analysis.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis with human-rodent somatic cell hybrids, Tekur et al.
(1999) mapped the YBX2 gene to chromosome 17p13.1-p11.2.

603473	TITLE *603473 LARGE TUMOR SUPPRESSOR, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; LATS1
DESCRIPTION In studies in Drosophila, Xu et al. (1995) used mosaic flies to screen
for tumor suppressors or negative regulators of cell proliferation. The
cellular composition of these flies resembled that of cancer patients
who are chimeric individuals carrying a small number of mutated somatic
cells. One of the genes they identified was the 'large tumor suppressor'
gene, lats (also known as wts), which encodes a putative
serine/threonine kinase. Somatic cells mutant for lats undergo extensive
proliferation and form large tumors in many tissues in mosaic adults.
Mutants homozygous for various lats alleles display a range of
developmental defects, including embryonic lethality. Although many
tumor suppressors were identified in Drosophila melanogaster, it was not
clear whether these fly genes were directly relevant to tumorigenesis in
mammals.

Tao et al. (1999) isolated mammalian homologs of Drosophila lats. Human
LATS1 and mouse Lats1 share 99% amino acid sequence identity in the
C-terminal kinase domain; human LATS1 and fly lats share 74% amino acid
sequence identity in this region. Northern blot analysis detected LATS1
expression in all fetal and adult tissues examined, with highest
expression in adult ovary. Human LATS1 suppressed tumor growth and
rescued all developmental defects, including embryonic lethality, in
flies. In mammalian cells, LATS1 was phosphorylated in a cell
cycle-dependent manner and complexed with CDC2 (116940) in early
mitosis. These and other biochemical observations indicated that LATS1
is a novel negative regulator of CDC2/cyclin A.

To elucidate further the function of mammalian LATS1, St. John et al.
(1999) generated Lats1 -/- mice. The homozygous deficient animals
exhibited a lack of mammary gland development, infertility, and growth
retardation. Accompanying these defects were hyperplastic changes in the
pituitary and decreased serum hormone levels. The reproductive hormone
defects of the homozygous deficient mice were reminiscent of isolated
LH-hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and corpus luteum insufficiency in
humans. Furthermore, the Lats1 -/- mice developed soft-tissue sarcomas
and ovarian stromal cell tumors and were highly sensitive to
carcinogenic treatments. The data demonstrated a role for LATS1 in
mammalian tumorigenesis and specific endocrine dysfunction. The
significance of the findings of Tao et al. (1999) and St. John et al.
(1999) were discussed by Kemp (1999).

602756	TITLE *602756 EPHRIN A2; EFNA2
;;EPH-RELATED RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASE LIGAND 6; EPLG6;;
LIGAND OF EPH-RELATED KINASE 6; LERK6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

See 179610 for background on ephrins and the Eph receptor family.

CLONING

By screening a human genomic library with a mouse ephrin-A2 (Efna2)
cDNA, Cerretti and Nelson (1998) isolated the genomic sequence of EFNA2.
The predicted 213-amino acid EFNA2 protein is composed of a signal
sequence, a receptor-binding region, a spacer region, and a hydrophobic
region.

By screening a fetal brain cDNA library with a fragment of human EFNA4
(601380), Aasheim et al. (1998) cloned a human EFNA2 cDNA. The deduced
214-amino acid protein contained a signal sequence, 3 potential
N-glycosylation sites, and a hydrophilic C terminus including a GPI
linkage signal. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected a
single 2.4-kb transcript in fetal intestine and brain and in adult
colon, small intestine, and lung. During mouse embryogenesis, Efna2 is
first detected in the dorsal region of the presumptive midbrain at
embryonic (E) day 8. By E9, there are high levels of Efna2 expression in
the midbrain and lower levels in the dorsal anterior hindbrain. Between
E8.5 and E11, it is expressed in the first and second branchial arches,
somites, and limb buds.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cerretti and Nelson (1998) determined that the EFNA2 gene has 4 exons;
its structure is identical to the gene structures of mouse Efna3
(601381), Efna4, and Efnb1 (300035) through the first 3 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Although ephrins form a high-affinity multivalent complex with their
receptors present on axons, axons can be rapidly repelled rather than
being bound. Hattori et al. (2000) showed that ephrin-A2 forms a stable
complex with the metalloproteinase Kuzbanian (ADAM10; 602192), involving
interactions outside the cleavage region and the protease domain. Eph
receptor binding triggered ephrin-A2 cleavage in a localized reaction
specific to the cognate ligand. The cleavage-inhibiting mutation in
ephrin-A2 delayed axon withdrawal. Hattori et al. (2000) concluded that
their studies reveal mechanisms for protease recognition and control of
cell surface proteins, and, for ephrin-A2, they may provide a means for
efficient axon detachment and termination of signaling.

Using immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy, Lim et al. (2008)
demonstrated that nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR; 162010) and
ephrin-As, including Efna2 and Efna5 (601535), colocalized within
caveolae along mouse retinal axons and formed a complex required for Fyn
(137025) phosphorylation upon binding EphAs, activating a signaling
pathway that led to cytoskeletal changes. Retinal axons repulsed EphAs
by ephrin-A reverse signaling in an Ngfr-dependent manner. Mice lacking
Ngfr constitutively or specifically in retina had aberrant anterior
shifts in retinal axon terminations in the superior colliculus,
consistent with diminished repellent activity mediated by graded
collicular EphAs. Lim et al. (2008) concluded that NGFR is a signaling
partner for EPHAs and that the EPHA/NGFR complex reverse signals to
mediate axon repulsion required for guidance and mapping.

MAPPING

Using PCR-based screening of genomic DNA from human/rodent hybrid cell
lines, Aasheim et al. (1998) mapped the EFNA2 gene to chromosome 19. By
FISH, they narrowed the location to 19p13.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Cang et al. (2005) created Efna2/Efna3 (601381)/Efna5 (601535)
triple-knockout (TKO) mice and found that the thalamocortical
projections from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus to the visual
cortex showed abnormal topographic mapping. Functional imaging in
Efna-TKO mice revealed that the primary visual area (V1) was rotated and
shifted medially and that the internal organization of the visuotopic
map was disrupted. Cang et al. (2005) concluded that EFNAs guide the

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Choline, a major constituent of cell membranes, participates in the
synthesis of acetylcholine in cholinergic neurons. It is taken up with
high affinity at cholinergic nerve terminals in a sodium-dependent
manner. O'Regan et al. (2000) cloned CTL1, a suppressor for a yeast
choline transport mutation, from a Torpedo electric lobe yeast
expression library by functional complementation. By EST database
searching and PCR on a sarcoma cell line, they obtained cDNAs encoding
human CTL1 (606105), CTL2 (606106), and CTL4. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 712-amino acid CTL4 protein is and 43% and 67%
homologous to human CTL1 and CTL2, respectively. The CTL proteins
contain 10 transmembrane domains, 11 highly conserved cysteines, and no
signal peptide.

MAPPING

O'Regan et al. (2000) stated that the CTL4 gene, or NG22, had been
sequenced as part of the major histocompatibility complex III at 6p21.3.

614632	TITLE *614632 UV-STIMULATED SCAFFOLD PROTEIN A; UVSSA
;;KIAA1530
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Nucleotide excision repair (NER) removes a wide range of DNA damage,
including ultraviolet (UV) irradiation-induced lesions. UVSSA is part of
a UV-induced ubiquitinated protein complex involved in
transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER) (summary by Schwertman et al., 2012).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned UVSSA, which they designated
KIAA1530. The coding region of the transcript is flanked by several
repetitive elements, and the deduced protein contains 794 amino acids.
RT-PCR ELISA detected very high UVSSA expression in adult brain and
kidney, with high expression in all other fetal and adult tissues and
specific adult brain regions examined. Expression in fetal brain was
much lower than in adult brain.

Nakazawa et al. (2012) reported that the UVSSA protein contains 709
amino acids and has an N-terminal Vps27, HRS (HGS; 604375), and STAM
(601899) (VHS) ubiquitin-binding domain, followed by a putative nuclear
localization signal, a DUF2043 domain, and a second nuclear localization
signal. Database analysis revealed orthologs of UVSSA in several
vertebrates and in nematode.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis, Nakazawa et al. (2012) found that UVSSA
interacted with several components of the transcription-coupled NER
complex and with ERCC6 (609413). UVSSA appeared to have a role in
ubiquitination and dephosphorylation of stalled RNA polymerase II (see
180660) after UV irradiation, as well as in stabilization of ERCC6.
Mutation analysis revealed that the VHS and DUF2043 domains of UVSSA
were required to restore RNA synthesis after UV irradiation.

Zhang et al. (2012) presented findings similar to those of Nakazawa et
al. (2012). In addition, they showed that UVSSA-dependent ERCC6
stabilization was mediated by interaction of UVSSA with USP7 (602519), a
protease that removes ubiquitin from proteins.

Schwertman et al. (2012) found that knockdown of UVSSA in U2OS cells via
RNA interference caused UV hypersensitivity and reduced recovery of RNA
synthesis after UV irradiation. UVSSA interacted with elongating RNA
polymerase II, localized to UV-induced lesions, resided in
chromatin-associated transcription-coupled NER complexes, and stabilized
the transcription-coupled NER organizing protein ERCC6 by delivering
USP7 to the NER complex. Schwertman et al. (2012) concluded that
UVSSA-USP7-mediated stabilization of ERCC6 is a critical regulatory
mechanism of transcription-coupled NER.

GENE STRUCTURE

Independently, Nakazawa et al. (2012) and Zhang et al. (2012) determined
that the UVSSA gene contains 14 exons and spans 40.7 kb. The first exon
is noncoding.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the UVSSA gene
to chromosome 4. Nakazawa et al. (2012) and Zhang et al. (2012) stated
that the UVSSA gene maps to chromosome 4p16.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By exome sequencing of 2 cell lines (Kps3 and XP24KO) derived from 2
unrelated Japanese patients with UV-sensitive syndrome-3 (UVSS3;
614640), Nakazawa et al. (2012) identified a homozygous truncating
mutation in the UVSSA gene (K123X; 614632.0001). One of the patients had
previously been reported by Itoh et al. (1994) and the other by Fujiwara
et al. (1985). Direct sequencing of the UVSSA gene identified additional
homozygous mutations in 2 unrelated patients (614632.0002 and
614632.0003). The patients had onset of cutaneous photosensitivity after
sun exposure in infancy and developed freckles and telangiectasia, but
did not have skin tumors or other abnormalities. All of the cell lines
showed defective RNA synthesis recovery after UV irradiation, which was
restored after expression of wildtype UVSSA. Unscheduled DNA synthesis
was not affected. The cellular studies were consistent with a defect in
TC-NER. Pathogenic UVSSA mutations were not found in 61 individuals with
Cockayne syndrome (see, e.g., CSA, 216400).

Zhang et al. (2012) used microcell-mediated chromosome transfers via
mouse cells to identify the gene responsible for UVSS3 in the Kps3 cell
line (Itoh et al., 1994). The results indicated that the causative gene
was on mouse chromosome 5. Sequencing of the UVSSA gene identified a
homozygous K123X mutation in the Kps3 cell line and in the XP24KO cell
line (Fujiwara et al., 1985). Expression of wildtype UVSSA in Kps3 cells
restored normal levels of recovery of RNA synthesis after UV irradiation
and UV resistance.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
UV-SENSITIVE SYNDROME 3
UVSSA, LYS123TER

By exome sequencing of 2 cell lines (Kps3 and XP24KO) derived from 2
unrelated Japanese patients with UV-sensitive syndrome-3 (UVSS3;
614640), Nakazawa et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 367A-T
transversion in the UVSSA gene, resulting in a lys123-to-ter (K123X)
substitution. The 80-kD UVSSA protein could not be detected in patient
cells. The mutation was found in heterozygous state in 1 of 576 control
individuals (allele frequency of 0.09%). One of the patients (Kps3) had
an affected sib (Itoh et al., 1994) with the same mutation; each
unaffected parent was a heterozygous carrier. Patient XP24KO had
originally been reported by Fujiwara et al. (1985) and reclassified as
UVSS by Itoh et al. (2000). All patients had onset of cutaneous
photosensitivity after sun exposure in infancy and developed freckles
and telangiectasia, but did not have skin tumors or other abnormalities.

Zhang et al. (2012) used microcell-mediated chromosome transfers via
mouse cells to identify the gene responsible for UVSS3 in the Kps3 cell
line. The results indicated that the causative gene was on mouse
chromosome 5. Sequencing of the UVSSA gene identified a homozygous K123X
mutation in the Kps3 cell line and in the XP24KO cell line. Expression
of wildtype UVSSA in Kps3 cells restored normal levels of recovery of
RNA synthesis after UV irradiation and UV resistance. Zhang et al.
(2012) noted that the Kps3 cell line is not hypersensitive to oxidative
damage (Nardo et al., 2009), which may explain the mild phenotype.

.0002
UV-SENSITIVE SYNDROME 3
UVSSA, 1-BP DEL, 87G

In a cell line derived from an Israeli patient (TA24) with UVSS3
(614640), Nakazawa et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion
(87delG) in the UVSSA gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination. The mutation was not found in 576 control individuals. The
UVSSA protein could not be detected in patient cells. Patient cells
showed normal levels of UV-induced DNA repair synthesis, but drastically
reduced survival and recovery of RNA synthesis after UV exposure.

.0003
UV-SENSITIVE SYNDROME 3
UVSSA, CYS32ARG

In a Japanese girl (XP70TO) with UVSS3 (614640), originally reported to
have a mild form of xeroderma pigmentosa (Kawada et al., 1986), Nakazawa
et al. (2012) identified a homozygous transition in exon 2 of the UVSSA
gene, resulting in a cys32-to-arg (C32R) substitution. The mutant
protein was stably expressed, but the band intensity was faint. The
mutation was not found in 576 control individuals. Crystallographic
studies suggested that the mutation would obstruct interactions between
the VHS domain and ubiquitinated proteins.

165162	TITLE *165162 ONCOGENE JUN-D; JUND
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FUNCTION

JUND is the most broadly expressed member of the JUN family and the AP1
transcription factor complex (see 165160). Weitzman et al. (2000) found
that primary fibroblasts lacking murine Jund displayed p53
(191170)-dependent growth arrest, upregulated p19(ARF) (see 600160)
expression, and premature senescence. In contrast, immortalized cell
lines lacking Jund showed increased proliferation and higher cyclin D1
(CCND1; 168461) levels. These properties were reminiscent of the effects
of oncogenic RAS (190020) expression on primary and established cell
cultures. Furthermore, Jund -/- fibroblasts exhibited increased
p53-dependent apoptosis upon ultraviolet irradiation and were sensitive
to the cytotoxic effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF; 191160).
The antiapoptotic role of JUND was confirmed using an in vivo model of
TNF-mediated hepatitis. The authors proposed that JUND protects cells
from senescence, or apoptotic responses to stress stimuli, by acting as
a modulator of the signaling pathways that link RAS to p53.

Gerald et al. (2004) found that mouse Jund reduced tumor angiogenesis by
limiting Ras-mediated production of reactive oxygen species. Using
Jund-deficient cells, they showed that Jund regulates genes involved in
antioxidant defense, H2O2 production, and angiogenesis. Accumulation of
H2O2 in Jund -/- cells decreased the availability of Fe(II) and reduced
the activity of HIF-prolyl hydroxylases (see 606424) that target
hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha subunits (e.g., HIF1A; 603348) for
degradation. Subsequently, HIF-alpha proteins accumulated and enhanced
transcription of Vegfa (192240), a potent proangiogenic factor. Gerald
et al. (2004) concluded that their findings reveal the mechanism by
which JUND protects cells from oxidative stress and exerts an
antiangiogenic effect.

Behmoaras et al. (2008) demonstrated by combined congenic, linkage, and
microarray studies that the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription
factor JunD is a major determinant of macrophage activity and is
associated with glomerulonephritis susceptibility. Introgression of the
rat crescentic glomerulonephritis locus Crgn2 from the nonsusceptible
Lewis strain onto the Wistar Kyoto rat background led to significant
reductions in crescent formation, macrophage infiltration, Fc
receptor-mediated macrophage activation, and cytokine production.
Haplotype analysis restricted the Crgn2 linkage interval to a 430-kb
interval containing Jund, which is markedly overexpressed in Wistar
Kyoto macrophages and glomeruli. JunD knockdown in rat and human primary
macrophages led to significantly reduced macrophage activity and
cytokine secretion, indicating conservation of JunD function in
macrophage activation in rats and human and suggesting in vivo
inhibition of JunD as a possible therapeutic strategy for diseases
characterized by inflammation and macrophage activation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sullivan et al. (1999) found that the JUND gene contains no introns.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Trask et al. (1993) assigned the
JUND gene to 19p13.1-p12. Sullivan et al. (1999) determined that the
JUND gene is located about 27 kb proximal to PDE4C (600128).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Huang et al. (2012) reported the crystal structures of human menin
(613733) in its free form and in complexes with MLL1 (159555) or with
JUND, or with an MLL1-LEDGF (603620) heterodimer. These structures show
that menin contains a deep pocket that binds short peptides of MLL1 or
JUND in the same manner, but that it can have opposite effects on
transcription. The menin-JUND interaction blocks JUN N-terminal
kinase-mediated JUND phosphorylation and suppresses JUND-induced
transcription. In contrast, menin promotes gene transcription by binding
the transcription activator MLL1 through the peptide pocket while still
interacting with the chromatin-anchoring protein LEDGF at a distinct
surface formed by both menin and MLL1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using Jund knockout mice and an experimental model of chronic renal
injury (75% nephron reduction), Pillebout et al. (2003) demonstrated
that Jund was not required for the initial compensatory growth phase but
was essential to inhibit a second wave of cell proliferation and to halt
the development of renal lesions. They also showed that the effects of
Jund inactivation involve upregulation of the paracrine mitogen
transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFA; 190170), and suggested that JUND
is part of a regulatory network that controls proliferation to prevent
pathologic progression in chronic renal diseases.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NHE3 (SLC9A3; 182307) is a sodium/hydrogen exchanger in the brush border
membrane of the proximal tubule, small intestine, and colon that plays a
major role in transepithelial sodium absorption. SLC9A3R2, as well as
SLC9A3R1 (604990) and protein kinase A phosphorylation, may play a role
in NHE3 regulation.

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library with SRY
(480000) as bait, Poulat et al. (1997) obtained a cDNA encoding
SLC9A3R2, which they termed SIP1. The deduced 326-amino acid protein
contains 2 highly conserved PDZ domains. Northern blot analysis revealed
wide expression of SLC9A3R2, suggesting a function not restricted to the
sex-determination process. Western blot analysis showed expression of a
34-kD protein. Binding and mutational analyses confirmed the interaction
of the PDZ domains of SLC9A3R2 with the C terminus of SRY.
Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated nuclear expression of
SLC9A3R2.

By means of a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a lung fibroblast cDNA library
with the cytoplasmic tail of NHE3 as bait, Yun et al. (1997) isolated a
cDNA encoding SLC9A3R2, which they designated E3KARP. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 337-amino acid protein is 55% identical to SLC9A3R1
(Reczek et al., 1997). Yun et al. (1997) concluded that either E3KARP or
EBP50 (SLC9A3R1) is necessary for the cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Hall et al. (1998) determined that the DS/TxL motif at the cytoplasmic
tail of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2; 109690), P2Y1 (601167),
and CFTR (602421) is necessary for interaction with the first PDZ domain
of NHERF (SLC9A3R1) and NHERF2. They suggested that the presence of this
motif at the C terminus of a variety of proteins is a useful indicator
of potential NHERF binding to intracellular proteins.

Yun et al. (1998) showed that a central domain of NHE3, not a C-terminal
domain, interacts with NHERF2 through its second PDZ domain plus its C
terminus. Confocal microscopy demonstrated predominantly cytosolic
expression of NHERF2 in the absence of NHE3, with more plasma membrane
expression in the presence of NHE3. Gel overlay analysis showed that, as
seen with NHERF, the N terminus of ezrin (VIL2; 123900) interacts with
the C-terminal residues of NHERF2.

GENE FUNCTION

Mahon et al. (2002) demonstrated that parathyroid hormone receptor-1
(PTHR1; 168468) binds to the sodium/hydrogen exchanger regulatory
factors NHERF1 (604990) and NHERF2 through a PDZ-domain interaction in
vitro and in PTH target cells. NHERF2 simultaneously binds phospholipase
C-beta-1 and an atypical, carboxyl-terminal PDZ consensus motif, ETVM,
of the PTHR1 through PDZ1 and PDZ2, respectively. PTH treatment of cells
that express the NHERF2-PTH1R complex markedly activated phospholipase
C-beta and inhibits adenylylcyclase through stimulation of inhibitory G
proteins (see 139310). NHERF-mediated assembly of PTHR1 and
phospholipase C-beta is a unique mechanism to regulate PTH signaling in
cells and membranes of polarized cells that express NHERF, which may
account for many tissue- and cell-specific actions of PTH/PTH-related
protein (168470) and may also be relevant to signaling by many G
protein-coupled receptors.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human brain cDNA expression library,
DeMarco et al. (2002) found that PCMA2b (108733) interacted with NHERF2.
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis indicated that the interaction was
specific and selective, in that PCMA4b (108732) did not interact with
either NHERF2 or NHERF1, and PCMA2b preferred NHERF2 over NHERF1.
Fluorescence-tagged PCMA2b was expressed at the apical membrane of
canine kidney epithelial cells, where it colocalized with apically
targeted NHERF2. DeMarco et al. (2002) hypothesized that the
PCMA2b-NHERF2 interaction may allow the assembly of PMCA2b in a
multiprotein Ca(2+) signaling complex.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a rat glomerular cDNA library, Takeda
et al. (2001) found that the PDZ-binding motif in the cytoplasmic
C-terminal tail of rat podocalyxin (PODXL; 602632) bound the second PDZ
domain of Nherf2. Immunocytochemical analysis colocalized Nherf2 with
podocalyxin and ezrin along the apical domain of the glomerular
epithelial cell membrane. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that
Nherf2 and ezrin formed a multimeric complex with podocalyxin. The
complex interacted with the actin cytoskeleton, and this interaction was
disrupted in glomerular epithelial cells from rats treated with agents
that cause loss of foot processes. Takeda et al. (2001) concluded that
NHERF2 functions as a scaffold protein linking podocalyxin to ezrin and
the actin cytoskeleton.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ADP-ribosylation factors, or ARFS (see ARF1; 103180), are small
GTP-binding proteins within the Ras superfamily that regulate vesicle
trafficking in eukaryotic cells. ARF1 recruits coat proteins (e.g.,
COPA; 601924) to membranes on the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi
apparatus. Cytohesins, such as CYTH3, function as guanine-nucleotide
exchange factors (GEFs) for ARFs. These proteins contain a C-terminal
pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a central 200-amino acid region
similar to a domain within the yeast Sec7 protein, which is required for
vesicular traffic of polypeptides through the Golgi (Franco et al.,
1998).

CLONING

Klarlund et al. (1997) identified a cDNA encoding mouse Grp1 (general
receptor for phosphoinositides-1) by screening mouse adipocyte and brain
cDNA expression libraries with phosphoinositide probes. By searching an
EST database for sequences similar to mouse brain Grp1, followed by PCR
and screening of a human blood cDNA library, Venkateswarlu et al. (1998)
obtained a cDNA encoding PSCD3, which they called GRP1. The predicted
399-amino acid PSCD3 protein contains a 39-amino acid coiled-coil
domain, a 172-amino acid Sec7 domain, and a 118-amino acid PH domain.
PSCD3 shares 82.7% and 79.5% amino acid identity with PSCD1 and PSCD2
(602488), respectively, as well as 98.8% identity with mouse Grp1.

By searching an EST database for Sec7 domain-related sequences and by
screening a placenta cDNA library, Franco et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA
encoding PSCD3, which they called ARNO3. Northern blot analysis revealed
that PSCD3, in contrast to the ubiquitously expressed PSCD1 and PSCD2,
is expressed as a 4.5-kb transcript that is almost absent from liver,
thymus, and peripheral blood lymphocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

By Scatchard and mutational analyses, Venkateswarlu et al. (1998)
determined that PSCD3 binds via its PH domain to the inositol head group
of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate with high affinity. Confocal
laser microscopy demonstrated that stimulation of cells with either
epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530) or nerve growth factor (NGF;
162030) results in PH domain-dependent translocation of PSCD3 from the
cytosol to the plasma membrane. The translocation was rapid and
transient with EGF, whereas NGF mediated a relatively longer
translocation.

Franco et al. (1998) found that PSCD3, like PSCD1 and PSCD2, showed GEF
activity, mediated by the Sec7 domain, towards ARF1 but not ARF6
(600464). Immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that overexpression of
PSCD3 induced major morphologic alterations of the Golgi apparatus,
including redistribution of Golgi resident proteins and the coat protein
COPB (600959).

By yeast 2-hybrid screening and in vitro pull-down assays, Nevrivy et
al. (2000) showed that the leucine-rich region of mouse Grasp (612027)
interacted with the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of Grp1. In
transfected HEK293 cells, Grasp enhanced Grp1 association with the
plasma membrane.

Using a library of endoribonuclease-prepared short interfering RNAs
(esiRNAs), Kittler et al. (2004) identified 37 genes required for cell
division, one of which was PSCD3. These 37 genes included several
splicing factors for which knockdown generates mitotic spindle defects.
In addition, a putative nuclear-export terminator was found to speed up
cell proliferation and mitotic progression after knockdown.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Lietzke et al. (2000) and Ferguson et al. (2000) determined the
structure of the GRP1 PH domain in the unliganded form and bound to
inositol 1,3,4,5-tetraphosphate. Lietzke et al. (2000) found that a
novel mode of phosphoinositide recognition involving a 20-residue
insertion within the beta-6/beta-7 loop explains the unusually high
specificity of the GRP1 PH domain and the promiscuous 3-phosphoinositide
binding typical of several other PH domains, including that of protein
kinase B (AKT1; 164730). By comparing the GRP1 PH domain to other PH
domains, general determinants of 3-phosphoinositide recognition and
specificity could be deduced.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PSCD3
gene to chromosome 7 (TMAP SHGC-35947).

607593	TITLE *607593 MEDIATOR OF DNA DAMAGE CHECKPOINT PROTEIN 1; MDC1
;;NUCLEAR FACTOR WITH BRCT DOMAINS PROTEIN 1; NFBD1;;
KIAA0170
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The MDC1 protein contains a forkhead homology-associated (FHA) domain
and 2 BRCA1 (113705) C-terminal motifs (BRCTs) and is required for the
intra-S-phase DNA damage checkpoint (Goldberg et al., 2003).

CLONING

Shang et al. (2003) identified nuclear factor with BRCT domains
protein-1 (NFBD1) as a mammalian homolog of S. cerevisiae Rad9.

By randomly sequencing cDNAs obtained from the human myeloid cell line
KG-1, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned MDC1, which they called KIAA0170. The
deduced MDC1 protein contains 2,089 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
showed that MDC1 is ubiquitously expressed.

Goldberg et al. (2003) identified MDC1 as a binding partner for the
MRE11 complex (see MRE11; 600814). They determined that the MDC1 protein
has a predicted molecular mass of 226.5 kD. It contains an FHA domain at
its N terminus and 2 BRCTs at its C terminus. The central region of MDC1
has 19 consecutive repeats of an approximately 40-amino acid motif.

Stewart et al. (2003) reported that MDC1 contains a large S/TQ cluster
domain encompassing its N-terminal half. The central region of MDC1 has
a large proline/serine/threonine-rich repeat domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Goldberg et al. (2003) showed that, in response to ionizing radiation,
MDC1 was hyperphosphorylated in an ATM (607585)-dependent manner and
rapidly relocalized to nuclei foci containing the MRE11 complex,
phosphorylated histone H2AX (601772), and TP53BP1 (605230).
Downregulation of MDC1 expression by small interfering RNA yielded a
radioresistant DNA synthesis phenotype and prevented ionizing
radiation-induced focus formation by the MRE11 complex. However,
downregulation of MDC1 did not abolish the ionizing radiation-induced
phosphorylation of NBS1 (602667), CHK2 (604373), and SMC1 (300040), or
the degradation of CDC25A (116947). Furthermore, overexpression of the
MDC1 FHA domain interfered with focus formation by MDC1 itself and by
the MRE11 complex, and it induced a radioresistant DNA synthesis
phenotype. Goldberg et al. (2003) concluded that MDC1-mediated focus
formation by the MRE11 complex at sites of DNA damage is crucial for the
efficient activation of the intra-S-phase checkpoint.

Stewart et al. (2003) showed that MDC1 works with H2AX to promote
recruitment of repair proteins to the site of DNA breaks and controls
damage-induced cell-cycle arrest checkpoints. MDC1 formed foci that
colocalized extensively with gamma-H2AX foci within minutes after
exposure to ionizing radiation. H2AX was required for MDC1 foci
formation, and MDC1 formed complexes with phosphorylated H2AX. Peptides
containing the phosphorylated site on H2AX bound MDC1 in a
phosphorylation-dependent manner. Stewart et al. (2003) used small
interfering RNA to show that cells lacking MDC1 were sensitive to
ionizing radiation and that MDC1 controlled the formation of
damaged-induced TP53BP1, BRCA1 (113705), and MRN (MRE11, RAD50 (604040),
NBS1, i.e., the MRE11 complex) foci, in part by promoting efficient H2AX
phosphorylation. In addition, cells lacking MDC1 failed to activate the
intra-S phase and G2/M phase cell cycle checkpoints properly after
exposure to ionizing radiation, and this failure was associated with the
inability to regulate CHK1 (603078) properly.

Lou et al. (2003) found that MDC1 localized to sites of DNA breaks and
associated with CHK2 after DNA damage. This association was mediated by
the MDC1 FHA domain and the phosphorylated thr68 of CHK2. MDC1 was
phosphorylated in an ATM/CHK2-dependent manner after DNA damage,
suggesting that MDC1 may function in the ATM/CHK2 pathway. Consistent
with this hypothesis, suppression of MDC1 expression resulted in
defective S-phase checkpoint and reduced apoptosis in response to DNA
damage, which could be restored by expression of wildtype MDC1, but not
by MDC1 with a deleted FHA domain. Suppression of MDC1 expression
resulted in decreased p53 (191170) stabilization in response to DNA
damage. Lou et al. (2003) concluded that MDC1 is recruited through its
FHA domain to the activated CHK2 and has a critical role in
CHK2-mediated DNA damage responses.

Shang et al. (2003) showed that NFBD1 is a 250-kD nuclear protein
containing a forkhead-associated motif at its N terminus, 2 BRCT motifs
at its C terminus, and 13 internal repetitions of a 41-amino acid
sequence. Five minutes after gamma-irradiation, NFBD1 formed nuclear
foci that colocalized with the phosphorylated form of H2AX and CHK2, 2
phosphorylation events involved in early DNA damage response. NFBD1 foci
were also detected in response to camptothecin, etoposide, and
methylmethanesulfonate treatments. Deletion of the forkhead-associated
motif or the internal repeats of NFBD1 had no effect on DNA
damage-induced NFBD1 foci formation. Conversely, deletion of the BRCT
motifs abrogated damage-induced NFBD1 foci. Ectopic expression of the
BRCT motifs reduced damage-induced NFBD1 foci and compromised
phosphorylated CHK2- and phosphorylated H2AX-containing foci. Shang et
al. (2003) concluded that NFBD1, like BRCA1 and TP53BP1, participates in
the early response to DNA damage.

By examining immunoglobulin heavy chain (see 147100) class switch
recombination in mouse B-lymphocytes deficient in H2ax, Atm, 53bp1, or
Mdc1, Franco et al. (2006) determined that these factors promote end
joining and thereby prevent DNA double-strand breaks from progressing
into chromosomal breaks and translocations.

Dimitrova and de Lange (2006) found that MDC1 had a role in detection
and repair of human and mouse telomeres rendered dysfunctional through
inhibition of TRF2 (TERF2; 602027). MDC1 knockdown affected the
formation of telomere dysfunction-induced foci, diminishing accumulation
of phosphorylated ATM, TP53BP1, NBS1, and, to a lesser extent,
gamma-H2AX. In addition, inhibition of MDC1 itself or of its recruitment
to chromatin significantly decreased the rate of nonhomologous
end-joining of dysfunctional telomeres. MDC1 appeared to promote a step
in the nonhomologous end-joining pathway after removal of the 3-prime
telomeric overhang.

Kolas et al. (2007) determined that the ubiquitin ligase RNF8 (611685)
mediates ubiquitin conjugation and 53BP1 (605230) and BRCA1 (113705)
focal accumulation at sites of DNA lesions. Moreover, Kolas et al.
(2007) established that MDC1 recruits RNF8 through phosphodependent
interactions between the RNF8 forkhead-associated domain and motifs in
MDC1 that are phosphorylated by the DNA damage-activated protein kinase
ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM; 607585). They showed that depletion
of the E2 enzyme UBC13 (603679) impairs 53BP1 recruitment to sites of
damage, which suggests that it cooperates with RNF8. RNF8 was shown to
promote the G(2)/M DNA damage checkpoint and resistance to ionizing
radiation. Kolas et al. (2007) concluded that their results demonstrated
how the DNA damage response is orchestrated by ATM-dependent
phosphorylation of MDC1 and RNF8-mediated ubiquitination.

Pei et al. (2011) found that H4K20 methylation actually increases
locally upon the induction of double-strand breaks and that methylation
of H4K20 at double-strand breaks is mediated by the histone
methyltransferase MMSET (602952) in mammals. Downregulation of MMSET
significantly decreases H4K20 methylation at double-strand breaks and
the subsequent accumulation of 53BP1. Furthermore, Pei et al. (2011)
found that the recruitment of MMSET to double-strand breaks requires the
gamma-H2AX (601772)-MDC1 pathway; specifically, the interaction between
the MDC1 BRCT domain and phosphorylated ser102 of MMSET. Thus, Pei et
al. (2011) proposed that a pathway involving gamma-H2AX-MDC1-MMSET
regulates the induction of H4K20 methylation on histones around
double-strand breaks, which, in turn, facilitates 53BP1 recruitment.

MAPPING

By analysis of human/rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al. (1996)
mapped the MDC1 gene to chromosome 6.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lou et al. (2006) found that Mdc1 -/- mice were born at the expected
mendelian frequency, but they showed a phenotype similar to that of H2ax
-/- mice, including growth retardation, male infertility, immune
defects, chromosome instability, DNA repair defects, and radiation
sensitivity. In the absence of Mdc1, many downstream Atm signaling
events were defective following DNA damage. Lou et al. (2006) concluded
that MDC1 is a signal amplifier of the ATM pathway that is vital in
controlling proper DNA damage response and maintaining genomic
stability.

161565	TITLE *161565 NATURAL KILLER TUMOR RECOGNITION SEQUENCE; NKTR
;;NATURAL KILLER TRIGGERING RECEPTOR
DESCRIPTION The natural killer triggering receptor (NKTR) is involved in the
recognition of tumor cells by large granular lymphocytes (LGLs) (Frey et
al., 1991; Anderson et al., 1993). LGLs are a subpopulation of white
blood cells that have the ability to kill target tumor cells by an
MHC-independent mechanism. The protein product of the NKTR gene is
present on the surface of LGLs and facilitates their binding to tumor
targets. The gene codes for a protein of 150,000 Da, with a unique amino
acid structure consisting of a 58-amino acid hydrophobic amino terminus
followed by a cyclophilin-related domain. No other known mammalian
receptor gene has been found to contain this strong identity to the
cyclophilin protein in an external domain. By somatic cell hybrid
analysis, Young et al. (1993) assigned the NKTR gene to 3p23-p21.
Interspecific backcross analysis demonstrated that the murine homolog
maps to the distal end of mouse chromosome 9 and is closely linked to
the locus coding for cholecystokinin (Cck). This region of mouse 9
shares a region of homology with human 3p. Hybridization to DNA from a
variety of species including the monkey, cat, and dog was observed,
indicating that this gene is highly conserved among mammalian species.

Rinfret and Anderson (1993) observed 2 alternative splicing events in
the 5-prime region of the NKTR mRNA in human and mouse. One uses an
alternative exon 6 that disrupts the NKTR coding region and produces an
mRNA encoding a truncated protein. The other splicing event generates a
deletion by use of an alternative splice acceptor within exon 9. Rinfret
and Anderson (1993) observed all 4 possible combinations of these events
in cDNAs. Activation of natural killer cells by IL2 (147680) changes the
pattern of splicing, resulting in increased production of full-length
protein. Simons-Evelyn et al. (1997) characterized the first 8 exons and
5-prime region of mouse Nktr. They found that mouse intron 5 also
contains the alternative exon that disrupts the open reading frame.

182175	TITLE *182175 SIGNAL RECOGNITION PARTICLE, 19-KD; SRP19
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a ribonucleoprotein complex
that mediates the targeting of proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER). The complex consists of a 7S (or 7SL) RNA and 6 different
proteins, SRP9 (600707), SRP14 (600708), SRP19, SRP54 (604857), SRP68
(604858), and SRP72 (602122). The proteins are bound to the 7S RNA as
monomers (SRP19 and SRP54) or heterodimers (SRP9/SRP14 and SRP68/SRP72).
SRP9 and SRP14 bind to the Alu domain of the SRP, whereas the other 4
proteins belong to the S domain. SRP has at least 3 distinct functions
that can be associated with the protein subunits: signal recognition,
translational arrest, and ER membrane targeting by interaction with the
docking protein.

For information on a signal recognition particle database, see Larsen et
al. (1998).

By screening a liver cDNA library with an anti-SRP19 probe, Lingelbach
et al. (1988) isolated a human SRP19 cDNA encoding a 144-amino acid
protein. Sequence analysis showed that SRP19 contains a very basic
C-terminal domain of 7 lysine residues interrupted by 2 glycine
residues. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 0.9 kb
transcript in HeLa cells. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that SRP19 is
expressed as a 19-kD protein, identical in size to canine SRP19.
Functional analysis determined that the SRP19 protein binds to 7SL RNA
in canine pancreas.

GENE STRUCTURE

Groden et al. (1991) determined that the SRP19 gene consists of 5 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

In 2 small nested deletions of 100 to 260 kb identified by Joslyn et al.
(1991) in patients with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC; 175100), Groden
et al. (1991) identified 3 genes in a span of about 100 kb on chromosome
5. One of these was DP1 (125265); a second was the gene that is mutant
in APC, called by them DP2.5 (611731). The third was a gene which was
found to have the same sequence as that of SRP19. Horii et al. (1993)
discussed the occurrence of alternative splicing not only within the APC
gene but also between the APC gene and the neighboring SRP19 gene.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Wild et al. (2001) reported the 1.8-angstrom resolution crystal
structure of human SRP19 in complex with its primary binding site on
helix 6 of SRP RNA, which consists of a stem-loop structure closed by an
unusual GGAG tetraloop. Protein-RNA interactions are mediated by the
specific recognition of a widened major groove and the tetraloop without
any direct protein-base contacts and include a complex network of highly
ordered water molecules. Wild et al. (2001) proposed a model of the
assembly of the SRP core comprising SRP19, SRP54, and SRP RNA based on
crystallographic and biochemical data.

Halic et al. (2004) presented the structure of a targeting complex
consisting of mammalian SRP bound to an active 80S ribosome carrying a
signal sequence. This structure, determined to 12-angstrom resolution by
cryoelectron microscopy, enabled Halic et al. (2004) to generate a
molecular model of SRP in its functional conformation. The model showed
how the S domain of SRP contacts the large ribosomal subunit at the
nascent chain exit site to bind the signal sequence, and that the Alu
domain reaches into the elongation factor-binding site of the ribosome,
explaining its elongation arrest activity.

MAPPING

The SRP19 gene maps to chromosome 5q21-q22, between the DP1 (125265) and
APC (611731) genes (Groden et al., 1991).

600713	TITLE *600713 11-@BETA-HYDROXYSTEROID DEHYDROGENASE, TYPE I; HSD11B1
;;HSD11L
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

There are at least 2 isoforms of 11-beta-HSD. The first discovered,
HSD11B1, was purified (Lakshmi and Monder, 1988) and cloned (Agarwal et
al., 1989) from rat liver. This glycoprotein enzyme (also called type I)
catalyzes both 11-beta-dehydrogenation and the reverse 11-oxoreduction
reaction. The enzyme and corresponding mRNA have been detected in a wide
range of rat and human tissues, including liver, lung, and testis. The
other isoform, type II, is expressed predominantly in the kidney and
placenta and catalyzes only the 11-beta-dehydrogenation reaction; see
HSD11B2 (614232).

Tannin et al. (1991) isolated human cDNA clones encoding
11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type I from a testis cDNA library
by hybridization with the previously isolated rat 11-HSD cDNA clone. The
cDNA contained an open reading frame of 876 nucleotides, which predicted
a protein of 292 amino acids. The sequence was 77% identical at the
amino acid level to the rat 11-HSD. The mRNA was widely expressed but
the level of expression was highest in the liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tannin et al. (1991) determined that the HSD11B1 gene consists of 6
exons and is at least 9 kb long.

MAPPING

By hybridization of the human cDNA to a human/hamster hybrid cell panel,
Tannin et al. (1991) localized the HSD11B1 gene to chromosome 1. The
localization was confirmed by isolating the gene from a chromosome
1-specific library using the cDNA as a probe. By genomic sequence
analysis, Schutte et al. (2000) mapped the HSD11B1 gene to 1q32-q41.

GENE FUNCTION

Ricketts et al. (1998) studied the localization of this isozyme, using
an antibody raised in sheep against amino acids 19-33 of human
11-beta-HSD1. 11-Beta-HSD1 immunoreactivity was observed more intensely
around the hepatic central vein, with no staining around the portal
vein, hepatic artery, or bile ducts. Whereas no staining for
11-beta-HSD1 was seen in the adrenal medulla, immunoreactive protein was
observed in all 3 zones of the adrenal cortex (greatest in the zona
reticularis, less in the zona glomerulosa, and least in the zona
fasciculata). In the human ovary, immunoreactivity was observed in the
developing oocyte and the luteinized granulosa cells of the corpus
luteum. No staining was observed in granulosa cells, thecal cells, or
ovarian stroma, which contrasted with the marked expression of
11-beta-HSD2 in the granulosa cell layer. Sections of human decidua
showed high expression of 11-beta-HSD1 in decidual cells. In omental
adipose tissue, 11-beta-HSD1 immunoreactivity was observed in both
stromal and adipocyte cells.

Work by Nikkila et al. (1993) indicated that the liver isozyme HSD11B1
is probably not the cause of apparent mineralocorticoid excess with
hypertension. Further studies by Mune et al. (1995) demonstrated that
this syndrome is due to mutations in the kidney/placental isozyme (type
II) of HSD11 (HSD11B2).

Draper et al. (2002) studied the microsatellites CA19 and CA15 from DNA
of 413 normal individuals enrolled in the MONICA study of cardiovascular
risk factors and 557 Danish men (ADIGEN study), of whom 234 were obese
(BMI greater than or equal to 31 kg/m2) at draft board exam and 323 were
randomly selected controls from the draftee population with BMI below 31
kg/m2. No association was observed between HSD11B1 genotype and BMI in
either population. These data suggested that 11-beta-HSD1 is not a major
factor in explaining genetic susceptibility to obesity per se. However,
weak associations between HSD11B1 genotype, increased 11-beta-HSD1
activity, and waist-to-hip ratio suggested that polymorphic variability
at the HSD11B1 locus may influence susceptibility to central obesity
through enhanced 11-beta-HSD1 activity (cortisone to cortisol
conversion) in visceral adipose tissue.

Individual susceptibility to glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is
difficult to predict clinically. The findings of Cooper et al. (2003)
suggested that measures of HSD11B1 activity may predict individual
susceptibility to glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.

To test the hypothesis that HSD11B1 expression would increase in fetal
membranes during pregnancy and at labor, creating the potential for
local increase in cortisol production at term, Alfaidy et al. (2003)
examined HSD11B1 expression in placenta and fetal membranes obtained
during normal pregnancy from 6 nonlaboring women from uncomplicated term
pregnancies after elective cesarean section. At term, immunoreactive
HSD11B1 expression was localized predominantly to the chorion
trophoblast cells, attached deciduas, and amnion epithelial cells.
HSD11B1 expression in fetal membranes increased with gestational age and
reflected increased enzyme reductase activity. No change in HSD11B1
expression was found in placental tissue from the same patients. There
was a significant increase in HSD11B1 expression in amnion but not in
chorion with the onset of labor. Alfaidy et al. (2003) suggested that
increases in HSD11B1 expression/activity by intrauterine membranes
during late gestation may result in increased potential for a local
increase in cortisol production and that fetal membranes should be
considered as an extraadrenal source of cortisol during late gestation.
This local cortisol production may be involved in different pathways
contributing to the regulation of parturition.

Sandeep et al. (2004) showed that 11-beta-HSD1, but not 11-beta-HSD2,
mRNA is expressed in the human hippocampus, frontal cortex, and
cerebellum.

GENE FAMILY

Agarwal et al. (1995) compared the genes encoding the liver and kidney
isozymes, which they symbolized HSD11L and HSD11K, respectively. HSD11K
has 5 exons; HSD11L has 6 exons. The coding sequences of these genes are
only 21% identical. In vitro, the NAD(+)-dependent kidney (type 2)
isozyme catalyzes 11-beta-dehydrogenase but not reductase reactions,
whereas the NADP(+)-dependent liver (type 1) isozyme catalyzes both
reactions.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Cortisone Reductase Deficiency 2

In cortisone reductase deficiency (614662), activation of cortisone to
cortisol does not occur, suggesting a defect in the HSD11B1 gene because
11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 is a primary regulator of
tissue-specific glucocorticoid bioavailability. In vivo, 11-beta-HSD1
catalyzes the reduction of cortisone to cortisol, whereas purified
enzyme acts as a dehydrogenase, converting cortisol to cortisone.
Oxoreductase activity can be regained via an NADPH-regeneration system
involving the cytosolic enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD;
305900); however, because the catalytic domain of 11-beta-HSD1 faces
into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Draper et al. (2003)
hypothesized that the endolumenal hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(H6PD; 138090) regenerates NADPH in the ER, thereby influencing
directionality of 11-beta-HSD1 activity. Draper et al. (2003) identified
variation in the HSD11B1 gene that was later shown to be polymorphism
(see 600713.0001). The patients of Draper et al. (2003) carried
causative mutations in the H6PD gene (see CORTRD1, 604931).

In 2 young boys with a mild form of cortisone reductase deficiency, in
whom no mutations were detected in the H6PD gene (138090), Lawson et al.
(2011) identified heterozygosity for 2 different missense mutations in
the HSD11B1 gene (600713.0002 and 600713.0003). The mutations were
inherited from their mothers, who had similar biochemical profiles.
Expression of the mutants in bacterial and mammalian cells greatly
reduced or abolished HSD11B1 activity.

- Association with Alzheimer Disease Risk

Because glucocorticoid excess increases neuronal vulnerability, genetic
variations in the glucocorticoid system may be related to the risk for
Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300). De Quervain et al. (2004) analyzed SNPs
in 10 glucocorticoid-related genes in 351 AD patients and 463 unrelated
control subjects. Set-association analysis revealed that a rare
haplotype in the 5-prime regulatory region of the HSD11B1 gene was
associated with a 6-fold increased risk for sporadic AD. In a
reporter-gene assay, the rare risk-associated haplotype reduced HSD11B1
transcription by 20% compared with the common haplotype. De Quervain et
al. (2004) concluded that a functional variation in the glucocorticoid
system increases risk for AD.

OTHER FEATURES

In aging humans and rodents, interindividual differences in cognitive
function have been ascribed to variations in long-term glucocorticoid
exposure. In human populations, including those with Cushing disease
(see 219080), Alzheimer disease (see 104300), depression, and normal
aging, higher cortisol levels have been associated with poorer memory
and hippocampal shrinkage/neuronal loss. 11-Beta-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase type 1 regenerates the active glucocorticoid cortisol from
circulating inert cortisone, thus amplifying intracellular
glucocorticoid levels in some tissues. Sandeep et al. (2004) showed that
11-beta-HSD1, but not 11-beta-HSD2, mRNA is expressed in the human
hippocampus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum. In 2 randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies, administration of
the 11-beta-HSD inhibitor carbenoxolone improved verbal fluency after 4
weeks in 10 healthy elderly males and improved verbal memory after 6
weeks in 12 patients with type II diabetes (125853). Although
carbenoxolone had been reported to enhance hepatic insulin sensitivity
in short-term studies (Walker et al., 1995; Andrews et al., 2003), there
was no change in glycemic control or serum lipid profile, nor was plasma
cortisol altered. Sandeep et al. (2004) suggested that 11-beta-HSD1
inhibition may be an approach to prevent or ameliorate cognitive
decline.

11-Beta-HSD1 is a promising target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes
mellitus because of its role in the cortisone-to-cortisol conversion in
visceral adipose tissue. The nonselective 11-beta-HSD inhibitor
carbenoxolone had been found not clinically viable because of adverse
effects associated with inhibition of 11-beta-HSD2 (see 218030),
including cortisol-dependent mineralocorticoid excess and hypokalemic
alkalosis. Courtney et al. (2008) tested the safety, tolerability,
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of PF-00915275, a selective
11-beta-HSD1 inhibitor, in 60 healthy adult volunteers. They reported
that PF-00915275 was well tolerated across all doses studied for up to 2
weeks, and that prednisolone generation tests and ratios of urinary
corticosteroid metabolites are useful markers of 11-beta-HSD1
inhibition.

ANIMAL MODEL

Masuzaki et al. (2001) created transgenic mice overexpressing
11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 selectively in adipose
tissue to an extent similar to that found in adipose tissue from obese
humans. These mice had increased adipose levels of corticosterone and
developed visceral obesity that was exaggerated by a high-fat diet. The
mice also exhibited pronounced insulin-resistant diabetes,
hyperlipidemia, and, surprisingly, hyperphagia despite hyperleptinemia.
Increased adipocyte 11-beta-hydroxysteroid type 1 activity may be a
common molecular etiology for visceral obesity and the metabolic
syndrome.

Kotelevtsev et al. (1997) generated mice carrying a targeted disruption
of 11-beta-HSD1. Homozygous null mice were unable to regenerate
corticosterone from inert 11-dehydrocorticosterone. They observed
attenuated gluconeogenic responses upon stress and resistance to
hyperglycemia induced by chronic high-fat feeding. The authors concluded
that 11-beta-HSD1 activity is an important amplifier of intrahepatic
glucocorticoid action in vivo.

Morton et al. (2001) investigated liver-dependent changes in lipid and
lipoprotein metabolism in Hsd11b1 knockout mice (Kotelevtsev et al.
(1997)). By measuring circulating levels of lipids and lipoproteins,
Morton et al. (2001) observed lower plasma triglyceride levels,
increased HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI levels in
Hsd11b1-deficient mice. Using Northern blot analysis, they detected
exaggerated induction of genes encoding lipogenic enzymes and a marked
suppression of genes for fat catabolism in Hsd11b1-null mice after
fasting and refeeding. By measuring plasma glucose levels after fasting
and refeeding, the authors determined that Hsd11b1-null mice have
improved glucose tolerance. Morton et al. (2001) concluded that HSD11B1
deficiency produces an improved metabolic profile characterized by
increased lipid catabolism, increased hepatic insulin sensitivity, and
reduced intracellular glucocorticoid concentrations.

Paterson et al. (2004) produced transgenic mice overexpressing Hsd11b1
selectively in liver. Transgenic animals with 2- and 5-fold elevated
liver Hsd11b1 activity exhibited mild insulin resistance without altered
fat depot mass. They showed fatty liver and dyslipidemia with increased
hepatic lipid synthesis/flux associated with elevated Lxra (602423) and
Ppara (170998) mRNA levels as well as impaired hepatic lipid clearance.
The transgenic mice also exhibited transgene dose-associated
hypertension and liver angiotensinogen expression.

In studies of angiogenesis in mice using an in vitro aortic ring model
and in vivo subcutaneously implanted polyurethane sponges, Small et al.
(2005) found that glucocorticoids administered at physiologic
concentrations inhibited angiogenesis. Blocking endogenous
glucocorticoid action with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist
RU38486 enhanced angiogenesis in subcutaneous sponges, in healing
surgical wounds, and in the myocardium of mice 7 days after
ligation-induced myocardial infarction. Hsd11b1-null mice showed
enhanced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo within sponges, wounds, and
infarcted myocardium. Small et al. (2005) concluded that HSD11B1
amplifies the angiostatic effect of glucocorticoids by regenerating
active glucocorticoids locally and thereby constrains the angiogenic
response after ischemia and injury.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
HSD11B1, 1-BP INS, 83557A AND 83597T-G (dbSNP rs45487298 AND dbSNP
rs12086634)

This variant, formerly titled CORTISONE REDUCTASE DEFICIENCY, has been
reclassified based on the findings of San Millan et al. (2005), White
(2005), Draper et al. (2006), and Smit et al. (2007).

In 3 unrelated individuals with cortisone reductase deficiency (CRD)
(see 614662), Draper et al. (2003) identified triallelic digenic
inheritance of mutations in the HSD11B1 and H6PD (138090) genes. All 3
patients were either homozygous or heterozygous with respect to 2
mutations in intron 3 of HSD11B1 that were in complete linkage
disequilibrium: an A insertion at position 83557 (83557insA) and a
T-to-G transversion 40 bp downstream at position 83597 (83597T-G). In
each kindred, at least 1 parent was heterozygous with respect to this
genotype. The allele frequency of the 83557insA/83597T-G haplotype was
14% in control populations. Luciferase reporter assays using mRNA from 1
of the patients demonstrated that transcriptional activity of mutant
constructs was 2.5 times lower than that of controls. In addition,
sequencing of H6PD identified mutations in exon 5 in all 3 patients (see
138090.0001 and 138090.0002). Draper et al. (2003) concluded that CRD
defines a new endoplasmic reticulum-specific redox potential and
establishes H6PD as a potential factor in the pathogenesis of polycystic
ovary syndrome (PCOS; 184700).

Because the phenotype of CRD resembles that of PCOS, San Millan et al.
(2005) investigated the R453Q variant of H6PD (138090.0002) and the
83557insA variant of HSD11B1 in 116 patients with PCOS and 76
nonhyperandrogenic controls. Four controls and 5 patients presented 3 of
4 mutant alleles of H6PD R453Q and HSD11B1 83557insA, which is the
genotype observed in some subjects with CRD. Estimates of 11-beta-HSD
oxoreductase activity were measured in 6 of these 9 women, ruling out
CRD. Patients homozygous for the R453 allele, which was more frequent in
PCOS patients, presented with increased cortisol and
17-hydroxyprogesterone levels compared with carriers of Q453 alleles;
these differences were not observed in controls. HSD11B1 83557insA
genotypes were not associated with PCOS and did not influence any
phenotypic variable. San Millan et al. (2005) concluded that digenic
triallelic genotypes of the H6PD R453Q variant and HSD11B1 83557insA
mutation do not always cause CRD.

In a population-based association study, White (2005) genotyped 3,551
individuals for the 83597T-G polymorphism in intron 3 of the HSD11B1
gene and the R453Q polymorphism in the H6PD gene. Both polymorphisms
occurred more frequently than previously reported, with the so-called
apparent CRD (ACRD) genotypes (at least 3 of 4 minor alleles present)
occurring in 7% of subjects. There were no associations between genotype
and body mass index; waist/hip ratio; visceral adiposity; measures of
insulin sensitivity; levels of testosterone, FSH, or LH (in females); or
risk of PCOS. In addition, there was no genotype effect on urinary free
cortisol/cortisone or corticosteroid metabolite ratios, which were
measured in 10 subjects, each carrying 0, 3, or 4 minor alleles. White
(2005) concluded that previously reported associations of ACRD with
HSD11B1 and H6PD alleles represented ascertainment bias, but noted that
rare severe mutations in these genes cannot be ruled out.

In a case-control study involving 256 nuclear families ascertained from
PCOS offspring, 213 singleton cases, and 549 controls, Draper et al.
(2006) analyzed CRD-related variants in the HSD11B1 (83597T-G; dbSNP
rs12086634) and H6PD (R453Q; dbSNP rs6688832) genes but found no
differences in genotype distribution between PCOS cases and controls.
Draper et al. (2006) concluded that the variants do not influence
susceptibility to PCOS and, noting that the genotype combination
previously implicated in the development of CRD had a similar prevalence
in PCOS patients and controls, they suggested that it was likely that
additional variants within these genes are required for the development
of CRD.

Smit et al. (2007) analyzed the 83557insA polymorphism in the HSD11B1
gene and the R453Q polymorphism in H6PD in 6,452 elderly Caucasian
individuals from 2 population-based cohorts and found no association
between genotype distribution or combined genotypes on body mass index,
adrenal androgen production, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic and diastolic
blood pressure, fasting glucose levels, glucose tolerance test, or
incidence of dementia (see 600274). Given the high frequency of the 2
polymorphisms in these 2 Caucasian populations, with 3.8% and 4.0%
carrying at least 3 affected alleles, respectively, Smit et al. (2007)
concluded that it was very unlikely that these SNPs interact to cause
CRD.

.0002
CORTISONE REDUCTASE DEFICIENCY 2
HSD11B1, ARG137CYS

In an 8-year-old boy with a mild form of cortisone reductase deficiency
(CORTRD2; 614662), Lawson et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a
409C-T transition in exon 4 of the HSD11B1 gene, resulting in an
arg137-to-cys (R137C) substitution. The mutation alters a highly
conserved residue on the edge of the dimer interface that forms a salt
bridge with another highly conserved residue on the other subunit. The
proband's mother, who had a biochemical profile similar to that of her
son, was also heterozygous for the R137C mutation, which was not found
in 120 control chromosomes. Transfection studies in HEK293 cells
demonstrated that the R137C mutant produced only 5% of wildtype
activity, and expression in a bacterial system yielded 6-fold less
soluble protein than wildtype, suggestive of interference with subunit
folding or dimer assembly. Simultaneous expression of the R137C mutant
and wildtype HSD11B1 in bacterial or mammalian cells, to simulate the
heterozygous condition, indicated a marked suppressive effect of the
mutant on the yield and activity of HSD11B1 dimers, consistent with a
dominant-negative effect.

.0003
CORTISONE REDUCTASE DEFICIENCY 2
HSD11B1, LYS187ASN

In a 13-year-old boy with a mild form of cortisone reductase deficiency
(CORTRD2; 614662), Lawson et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a
561G-T transversion in exon 5 of the HSD11B1 gene, resulting in a
lys187-to-asn (K187N) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
core catalytic tetrad required for enzyme activity. The proband's
mother, who had a biochemical profile similar to that of her son, was
also heterozygous for the K187N mutation, which was not found in 120
control chromosomes. No enzyme activity could be detected when the K187N
mutant was expressed in either bacterial or mammalian cells, and in the
bacterial system, no soluble protein could be detected at all,
suggesting the importance of this residue to structural stability.
Simultaneous expression of the K187N mutant and wildtype HSD11B1 in
bacterial or mammalian cells, to simulate the heterozygous condition,
indicated a marked suppressive effect of the mutant on the yield and
activity of HSD11B1 dimers, consistent with a dominant-negative effect.

;;VACUOLAR ATPase, 14-KD SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) is a multisubunit complex that mediates
acidification of intracellular organelles. By large-scale sequencing of
a human fetal brain cDNA library and database searching, Fujiwara et al.
(1995) identified a sequence showing homology with the 14-kD subunit of
M. sexta V-ATPase. Using 5-prime RACE, they cloned a full-length cDNA
encoding a deduced 119-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 14
kD. The protein is predominantly hydrophilic and shares 69% and 70%
sequence identity with the M. sexta and Drosophila homologs,
respectively. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of a
0.8-kb transcript.

615051	TITLE *615051 ANKYRIN REPEAT- AND SOCS BOX-CONTAINING PROTEIN 6; ASB6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteins of the ASB family, such as ASB6, contain central tandem ankyrin
(see 612641) repeats and a C-terminal suppressor of cytokine signaling
(SOCS) box. SOCS box proteins are predicted to be involved in protein
degradation by acting as a bridge between substrate proteins and E3
ubiquitin protein ligases (see 601623) (review by Kile et al., 2002).

CLONING

Kile et al. (2001) showed that the deduced 418-amino acid mouse Asb6
protein has 8 tandem ankyrin repeats and a C-terminal SOCS box.

GENE FUNCTION

Kohroki et al. (2005) found that epitope-tagged ASB6 and several other
ASB family members interacted with endogenous CUL5 (601741) and RBX2
(RNF7; 603863) in immunoprecipitated HEK293 cells. The ASB proteins did
not interact with CUL2 (603135) or RBX1 (603814).

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the ASB6 gene to chromosome 9q34.11 based on an
alignment of the ASB6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK000555) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

608082	TITLE *608082 YIPPEE-LIKE 1; YPEL1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Farlie et al. (2001) cloned mouse Ypel1 from an embryonic day-10.5
branchial arch cDNA library. The deduced 118-amino acid protein contains
a putative nuclear localization signal and has a calculated molecular
mass of about 13.5 kD. By database analysis, they identified human
YPEL1, which encodes a deduced 119-amino acid protein that shares 99.2%
identity with mouse Ypel1. YPEL1 is highly homologous to Yippee, a
putative zinc-binding protein in Drosophila, and Farlie et al. (2001)
also identified YPEL1 homologs in quail and several lower species. The
human and quail YPEL1 proteins are identical. In situ hybridization of
mouse embryos detected expression of Ypel1 in a number of ventral
tissues, including branchial clefts and arches, which are associated
with craniofacial morphogenesis, and heart. The dorsal embryo was
completely free of transcript. Fluorescence-tagged mouse Ypel1 localized
predominantly to the nuclei of human, rodent, and quail cells following
transfection. Endogenous Ypel1 was detected within a proportion of
mesenchymal cells in quail branchial arch outgrowth cultures, but not
within ectodermal cells.

By analyzing genes on chromosome 22, followed by PCR and RACE of a fetal
brain cDNA library, Hosono et al. (2004) cloned YPEL1. The human and
monkey YPEL1 proteins are identical. YPEL1 shares 83.2 to 96.6% amino
acid identity with YPEL2 (609723), YPEL3 (609724), and YPEL4 (609725).
All YPEL proteins contain an 86-amino acid YPEL consensus sequence.
Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb YPEL1 transcript in fetal
brain, with weaker expression in fetal lung and kidney. A 1.0-kb YPEL1
transcript was detected in adult testis. Immunofluorescent staining of
COS-7 green monkey kidney cells localized Ypel1 to the centrosome and
nucleolus during interphase and at several punctate structures around
the mitotic apparatus during the mitotic phase.

GENE FUNCTION

Transfection of mouse Ypel1 into mouse fibroblasts resulted in confluent
cultures with the cobblestone appearance characteristic of epithelial
cells. Cells showed rearrangement of vimentin (193060), increased
circumferential F-actin (see 102610), and increased expression of NCAM
(116930).

GENE STRUCTURE

Hosono et al. (2004) determined that the YPEL1 genes contain 5 exons and
spans about 40 kb. Exon 1 is untranslated. The mouse Ypel1 gene has a
similar structure.

MAPPING

By FISH and genomic sequence analysis, Farlie et al. (2001) mapped the
YPEL1 gene to chromosome 22q11.2, a region associated with several
congenital anomalies involving craniofacial malformation, including
DiGeorge syndrome (188400) and velocardiofacial syndrome (192430). They
mapped the mouse Ypel1 gene to chromosome 16 in a region that shows
homology of synteny to human chromosome 22q11.

By genomic sequence analysis, Hosono et al. (2004) mapped the human
YPEL1 gene to chromosome 22q11.2 and the mouse Ypel1 gene to chromosome
16B1. They identified an apparent processed YPEL pseudogene on
chromosome 9p24.3 that shares similarity with YEPL1 through YEPL4.

603725	TITLE *603725 FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR 17; FGF17
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), such as FGF17, are growth factors and
oncogenes that contain a conserved, approximately 120-amino acid core.
Individual FGFs play important roles in embryonic development, cell
growth, morphogenesis, tissue repair, inflammation, angiogenesis, and
tumor growth and invasion (Hoshikawa et al., 1998).

CLONING

Hoshikawa et al. (1998) isolated human, mouse, and rat cDNAs encoding a
novel member of the FGF family, FGF17. The deduced 216-amino acid human
FGF17 protein is 98.6% identical to the mouse and rat Fgf17 proteins,
which are identical. Among known FGF family members, the FGF17 protein
is most similar to FGF8 (600483). FGF17 contains a typical hydrophobic
signal sequence at its N terminus, and the authors demonstrated that
recombinant rat Fgf17 can be efficiently secreted by High Five insect
cells. PCR analysis of rat adult tissues detected Fgf17 expression in
all tissues examined. In rat 14.5-day embryos, in situ hybridization
showed highest Fgf17 expression in the isthmus cerebellar and septum
neuroepithelia of the brain.

Using RT-PCR, Krejci et al. (2007) detected expression of several FGF
genes in femoral growth plate cartilage from 20- to 28-week gestation
fetuses; however, only FGF1 (131220), FGF2 (134920), FGF17, and FGF19
(603891) proteins were expressed at detectable levels.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed that FGF17 and FGF19 were uniformly
expressed throughout the growth plate. In contrast, FGF1 was expressed
only in the proliferative and hypertrophic zones, and FGF2 was expressed
only in the proliferative and resting zones.

To link FGF17 to GnRH (see 152760) biology, Miraoui et al. (2013)
examined Fgf17 expression in the nasal cavity of mouse embryos at
embryonic day 10.5, when GnRH neuron fate specification occurs. Fgf17
was robustly expressed in regions where Fgf8 is known to be highly
expressed: the commissural plate, the midbrain-hindbrain junction, and
the medial olfactory placode, where GnRH neurons emerge. Miraoui et al.
(2013) noted that there was hardly any Fgf17 expression in Fgf8
hypomorphic mice, suggesting that FGF17 should be considered a member of
the FGF8 synexpression group.

GENE FUNCTION

Using the Cre/loxP system, Sun et al. (2000) found that maintenance of
Fgf9 (600921) and Fgf17 expression is dependent on Shh (600725), whereas
Fgf8 expression is not. Sun et al. (2000) developed a model in which no
individual Fgf expressed in the apical ectodermal ridge is solely
necessary to maintain Shh expression, but instead the combined activity
of 2 or more apical ectodermal ridge Fgfs function in a positive
feedback loop with Shh to control limb development.

Krejci et al. (2007) showed that FGF1, FGF2, and FGF17, but not FGF19,
elicited potent activation of an ERK (see 601795) reporter gene in
primary cultures of human fetal chondrocytes. FGF1, FGF2, and FGF17, but
not FGF19, also inhibited proliferation of FGFR3 (134934)-expressing rat
chondrosarcoma chondrocytes.

Mariani et al. (2008) demonstrated that mouse limbs lacking Fgf4
(164980), Fgf9, and Fgf17 have normal skeletal pattern, indicating that
Fgf8 (600483) is sufficient among apical ectodermal ridge fibroblast
growth factors (AER-FGFs) to sustain normal limb formation. Inactivation
of Fgf8 alone causes a mild skeletal phenotype; however, when Mariani et
al. (2008) also removed different combinations of the other AER-FGF
genes, they obtained unexpected skeletal phenotypes of increasing
severity, reflecting the contribution that each FGF can make to the
total AER-FGF signal. Analysis of the compound mutant limb buds revealed
that, in addition to sustaining cell survival, AER-FGFs regulate
proximal-distal patterning gene expression during early limb bud
development, providing genetic evidence that AER-FGFs function to
specify a distal domain and challenging the longstanding hypothesis that
AER-FGF signaling is permissive rather than instructive for limb
patterning. Mariani et al. (2008) also developed a 2-signal model for
proximal-distal patterning to explain early specification.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 unrelated individuals with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
(HH20; 615270), Miraoui et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for
missense mutations in the FGF17 gene (603725.0001-603725.0003). One of
the 3 probands belonged to a large consanguineous 10-generation French
Canadian family with anosmic HH and cleft palate (see HH2, 147950), in
which Tornberg et al. (2011) had identified missense mutations in both
the FGFR1 (136350.0025) and HS6ST1 (604846.0002) genes; in that proband,
Miraoui et al. (2013) also identified 2 missense mutations in another
FGF-network gene, FLRT3 (604808.0001 and 604808.0002). Miraoui et al.
(2013) concluded that mutations in genes encoding components of the FGF
pathway are associated with complex modes of congenital HH (CHH)
inheritance and act primarily as contributors to an oligogenic genetic
architecture underlying CHH.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using whole brain imaging, Cholfin and Rubenstein (2007) found that mice
lacking Fgf17 showed a selective reduction in the size of the dorsal
frontal cortex, whereas the ventral/orbital frontal cortex was normal.
These changes were complemented by a rostromedial shift of sensory
cortical areas. The changes in regionalization persisted into adulthood.
Cholfin and Rubenstein (2007) concluded that FGF17 functions similarly
to FGF8 in patterning the neocortical map, but FGF17 is more selective
in regulating the properties of the dorsal but not ventral frontal
cortex.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 20 WITH ANOSMIA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
FGF17, ILE108THR

In the female proband from a large consanguineous 10-generation French
Canadian family with anosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH20;
615270) and cleft palate, previously reported by White et al. (1983) and
in whom Tornberg et al. (2011) had identified missense mutations in the
FGFR1 (R250Q; 136350.0025) and HS6ST1 (R296W; 604846.0002) genes,
Miraoui et al. (2013) also identified heterozygosity for a c.323T-C
transition in exon 4 of the FGF17 gene, resulting in an ile108-to-thr
(I108T) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the FGF core
domain. In addition, the proband was heterozygous and homozygous for 2
missense mutations in another FGF-network gene, FLRT3 (E97G, 604808.0001
and S144I, 604808.0002, respectively). Three other affected family
members also carried mutations in the FGFR1, HS6ST1, and FLRT3 genes,
and 4 unaffected family members carried 1 or 2 mutations in those genes,
but none had a mutation in the FGF17 gene. The I108T mutation was not
found in 155 controls or in the 1000 Genomes Project database. Analysis
of physical interactions between the ligand-binding region of FGFR1 and
FGF17 by surface-plasmon-resonance spectroscopy demonstrated that the
I108T mutant was defective in FGFR1 activation compared to wildtype; in
addition, the I108T mutant completely failed to activate the R250Q FGFR1
mutant, indicating that these 2 loss-of-function substitutions act in an
additive manner.

HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 20 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
FGF17, ARG177HIS

In a sporadic male patient with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
(HH20; 615270), Miraoui et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a
c.530G-A transition in exon 5 of the FGF17 gene, resulting in an
arg177-to-his (R177H) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
FGF core domain. The patient, who had a normal sense of smell, also
displayed low bone mass. The R177H mutation was not found in 155
controls or in the 1000 Genomes Project database. Analysis of physical
interactions between the ligand-binding region of FGFR1 (135350) and
FGF17 by surface-plasmon-resonance spectroscopy demonstrated that the
R177H mutant had dramatically reduced ability to activate FGFR1 compared
to wildtype.

FGF17, ASN187SER

In a sporadic male patient with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
(HH20; 615270), who was anosmic, Miraoui et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a c.560A-G transition in exon 5 of the FGF17 gene,
resulting in an asn187-to-ser (N187S) substitution at a conserved
residue in the C terminus. The mutation was not found in 155 controls or
in the 1000 Genomes Project database.

300525	TITLE *300525 PYRIMIDINERGIC RECEPTOR P2Y, G PROTEIN-COUPLED, 8; P2RY8
;;P2Y8
P2RY8/CRLF2 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

P2RY8 is a member of the purine nucleotide G protein-coupled receptor
gene family and is located in the pseudoautosomal region of the X
chromosome (Cantagrel et al., 2004).

CLONING

While investigating a pericentric inversion on the X chromosome,
inv(X)(p22.3)(q13.2), segregating in a family with mental retardation,
Cantagrel et al. (2004) identified 2 genes disrupted by the breakpoint:
P2RY8 and KIAA2022 (300524). P2RY8 encodes a deduced 359-amino acid
protein. Using RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis, Cantagrel et al.
(2004) found that P2RY8 is highly expressed in lymphocytes. Weaker
expression was seen in heart, kidney, and lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Adrian et al. (2000) analyzed the expression of several purinergic
receptors during differentiation in a promyelocytic leukemia cell line.
Granulocytic differentiation was induced by dimethylsulfoxide, and a
monocytic/macrophage phenotype was induced by phorbol esters. Moderate
P2Y8 expression was detected in undifferentiated cells, and expression
was completely downregulated during granulocyte differentiation. P2Y8
transcription decreased until 24 hours of monocytic differentiation,
then began to return to higher levels. P2Y8 expression was barely
detectable in normal blood leukocytes.

- P2RY8/CRLF2 FUSION GENE

Mullighan et al. (2009) reported a recurring interstitial deletion of
pseudoautosomal region 1 of chromosomes X and Y in B-progenitor ALL
(613035) that juxtaposes the first, noncoding exon of P2RY8 with the
coding region of CRLF2 (300357). They identified the P2RY8/CRLF2 fusion
in 7% of individuals with B-progenitor ALL and 53% of individuals with
ALL associated with Down syndrome. CRLF2 alteration was associated with
activating JAK mutations, and expression of human P2RY8/CRLF2 together
with mutated mouse Jak2 (147796) resulted in constitutive JAK-STAT
activation and cytokine-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells overexpressing
IL7 receptor-alpha (IL7R; 146661). Mullighan et al. (2009) concluded
that rearrangement of CRLF2 and JAK mutations together contribute to
leukemogenesis in B-progenitor ALL.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cantagrel et al. (2004) determined that the P2RY8 gene contains 2 exons
separated by a 70-kb intron.

MAPPING

Cantagrel et al. (2004) identified the P2RY8 gene at the Xp22.3
breakpoint of a pericentric inversion of the X chromosome.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In the family with the pericentric inversion inv(X)(q13;p22) studied by
Cantagrel et al. (2004), 2 males related as first cousins once removed
had severe mental retardation, whereas the carrier females who
represented the genealogic connection between the 2 affected males were
phenotypically unaffected. RT-PCR showed that the KIAA2022 transcript
was not expressed in the patients' cells, whereas the P2RY8 transcript
was expressed; the amount of P2RY8 was similar in the cells of the
affected patients and a tested carrier female. Because
haploinsufficiency of the P2RY8 gene in carrier mothers did not have a
phenotypic consequence, Cantagrel et al. (2004) concluded that the
severe mental retardation of the affected males was due to the absence
of the KIAA2022 gene product. However, screening of 20 probands from
X-linked mental retardation families revealed no mutation in the
KIAA2022 gene.

108733	TITLE *108733 ATPase, Ca(2+)-TRANSPORTING, PLASMA MEMBRANE, 2; ATP2B2
;;PLASMA MEMBRANE Ca(2+)-ATPase, TYPE 2; PMCA2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Ca(2+)-ATPases are a family of plasma membrane pumps encoded by at
least 4 genes: ATP2B1 (108731) on chromosome 12q21; ATP2B2; ATP2B3
(300014) on Xq28; and ATP2B4 (108732) on 1q25.

CLONING

Brandt et al. (1992) isolated and characterized a cDNA for the human
PMCA2 gene from a human fetal brain cDNA library. The 1,190-amino acid
protein showed greater than 98% sequence identity to the rat protein.

By PCR, Brandt et al. (1992) detected PMCA2 expression in brain, liver,
spinal cord, and adrenal gland. There were 2 PCR products in spinal
cord, suggesting the presence of PMCA2 splice variants.

By RT-PCR, Santiago-Garcia et al. (1996) found variable expression of
the PMCA and SERCA (see 108730) genes during development of human fetal
heart. PMCA2 was not detected in placenta or in fetal heart at the 3
stages tested, but 3 splice variants of PMCA2 were detected in adult
atrium.

Street et al. (1998) noted that the ATP2B2 gene undergoes alternative
splicing. All 4 ATP2B proteins are predicted to have 10
transmembrane-spanning domains with approximately 80% of the protein
mass located in the cytoplasm. The intracellular loop between T2 and T3
encodes the transducing domain that couples ATP hydrolysis with calcium
translocation. The largest intracellular loop, between T4 and T5,
includes the phosphoenzyme-forming residue and the nucleotide-binding
domain. The intracellular C terminus contains the calmodulin-binding,
protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent kinase and acidic phospholipid
regulatory domains.

GENE FUNCTION

Elwess et al. (1997) found that the alternative splice variants PMCA2a
and PMCA2b had much higher affinity for calmodulin than the
corresponding forms of PMCA4. At a high calmodulin concentration, PMCA2b
showed higher calcium affinity. The calcium affinity was localized to
the C terminus. Elwess et al. (1997) concluded that the PMCA2 variants
maintain a low free cytosolic calcium concentration.

Street et al. (1998) found Atp2b2 expression in mouse auditory and
vestibular hair cells, suggesting that the channel provides the means to
remove calcium from stereocilia.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human brain cDNA expression library,
DeMarco et al. (2002) found that PCMA2b interacted with NHERF2
(SLC9A3R2; 606553). Coimmunoprecipitation analysis indicated that the
interaction was specific and selective, in that PCMA4b did not interact
with either NHERF2 or NHERF1 (SLC9A3R1; 604990), and PCMA2b preferred
NHERF2 over NHERF1. Fluorescence-tagged PCMA2b was expressed at the
apical membrane of canine kidney epithelial cells, where it colocalized
with apically targeted NHERF2. DeMarco et al. (2002) hypothesized that
the PCMA2b-NHERF2 interaction may allow the assembly of PMCA2b in a
multiprotein Ca(2+) signaling complex.

Chicka and Strehler (2003) found that PMCA2b localized to both the
apical and basolateral membranes of polarized epithelial cells.
Different splice variants of the protein showed differential membrane
targeting.

MAPPING

Using the PMCA2 cDNA to probe Southern blots of human-rodent somatic
cell hybrid DNAs, Brandt et al. (1992) mapped the PMCA2 gene to human
chromosome 3. By a combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization,
analysis of somatic cell hybrids, and genetic linkage analysis in CEPH
families, Wang et al. (1994) confirmed assignment of the ATP2B2 gene to
3p26-p25.

Richards et al. (1993) reported that the PMCA2 gene, which is located on
3p, is situated centromeric to the gene (VHL; 608537) for von
Hippel-Lindau disease (193300). They reported other results that
excluded PMCA2 as the site of the mutation in VHL.

ANIMAL MODEL

Street et al. (1998) demonstrated that the deafwaddler (dfw) mouse
mutant, which is deaf and displays vestibular/motor imbalance, has a
mutation in the Atp2b2 gene. An A-to-G nucleotide transition in dfw DNA
caused a glycine-to-serine substitution at a highly conserved amino acid
position, whereas a second mutant allele carried a 2-bp deletion that
caused a frameshift predicted to result in a truncated protein. In the
cochlea, the Atp2b2 protein was localized to stereocilia and the
basolateral wall of hair cells in wildtype mice, but was not detected in
deafwaddler mice. The findings indicated that mutation of Atp2b2 may
cause deafness and imbalance by affecting sensory transduction in
stereocilia as well as neurotransmitter release from the basolateral
membrane. These mutations affecting Atp2b2 were the first to be found in
a mammalian plasma membrane calcium pump and defined a new class of
deafness genes that directly affect hair-cell physiology.

PMCA2 exhibits a highly restricted tissue distribution, suggesting that
it serves more specialized physiologic functions than some of the other
PMCA isoforms. A unique role in hearing is suggested by the high levels
of PMCA2 expression in cochlear outer hair cells and spiral ganglion
cells. To analyze the physiologic role of PMCA2, Kozel et al. (1998)
produced PMCA2-deficient mice by gene targeting. Homozygous PMCA2-null
mice grew more slowly than heterozygous and wildtype mice and exhibited
an unsteady gait and difficulties in maintaining balance. Histologic
analysis of the cerebellum and inner ear of mutant and wildtype mice
showed that null mutants have slightly increased numbers of Purkinje
neurons (in which PMCA2 is highly expressed), a decreased thickness of
the molecular layer, an absence of otoconia in the vestibular system,
and a range of abnormalities of the organ of Corti. Analysis of
auditory-evoked brainstem responses showed that homozygous mutants were
deaf and that heterozygous mice had a significant hearing loss. These
data demonstrated that PMCA2 is required for both balance and hearing
and suggested that it may be a major source of the calcium used in the
formation and maintenance of otoconia.

Reinhardt et al. (2004) noted that the PMCA2bw isoform is expressed
approximately 100-fold during lactation, and that expression levels
correlate with milk production and calcium secretion. They found that
mice homozygous for the loss of Pmca2 produced milk with 60% less
calcium than that of heterozygous or wildtype mice. There was no
alteration in whole-body calcium metabolism in the null mice. The
findings indicated that the Pmca2bw isoform, which allows the enzyme to
function as a high affinity calcium extrusion system on the apical
membrane, is necessary to produce the high levels of calcium in milk,
and that it occurs by direct secretion by the calcium pump.

Bortolozzi et al. (2010) characterized Tommy (tmy) mutant mice, which
were generated in an N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea mutagenesis screen. Tmy/tmy
mice were profoundly deaf at birth and were smaller than their
littermates. They developed severe ataxia, with hesitant wobbly gait and
frequent hyperextension of the rear limbs. Tmy heterozygous mice
developed deafness by 12 weeks of age, with full penetrance by 30 weeks.
Bortolozzi et al. (2010) identified the tmy mutation as a
nonconservative G-to-A transition in exon 7 of the Atp2b2 gene,
resulting in a gln629-to-lys (E629K) substitution in Atp2b2 w/a, the
Atp2b2 isoform expressed in hair cells (the substitution corresponds to
E584K in the Atp2b2 z/b isoform, which lacks the 45-amino acid insertion
in Atp2b2 w/a). Expression of mutant Atp2b2 in Chinese hamster ovary
cells caused impaired calcium extrusion, with inhibition of long-term,
nonstimulated calcium export. Recordings of neonate organotypic cultures
of utricle sensory epithelium confirmed impaired calcium export in both
tmy/tmy and tmy/+ mice following rapid calcium release.
Immunofluorescence analysis of the organ of Corti in tmy/tmy mice showed
a progressive base to apex degeneration of hair cells after postnatal
day 40.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 12, MODIFIER OF
ATP2B2, VAL586MET

In 3 of 5 sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with autosomal recessive
deafness (DFNB12; 601386) caused by a homozygous phe1888-to-ser
substitution in the CDH23 gene (F1888S; 605516.0010), Schultz et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 2075G-A transition in exon 12 of the
ATP2B2 gene, resulting in a val586-to-met (V586M) substitution. The 3
sibs heterozygous for V586M had severe to profound hearing loss
affecting all frequencies, whereas the other 2 sibs had high-frequency
hearing loss. Schultz et al. (2005) suggested that V586M modifies the
severity of sensorineural hearing loss.

;;ERAP140
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By Far Western screening of a lymphoma cell cDNA library for estrogen
receptor-alpha (ESR1; 133430)-associated factors, Shao et al. (2002)
identified a novel cDNA, nuclear receptor coactivator-7. NCOA7 encodes a
942-amino acid protein, which the authors called ERAP140 (estrogen
receptor-associated protein of 140 kD). Northern blot analysis revealed
an approximately 5.5-kb transcript in all tumor lines examined,
including ESR-positive and ESR-negative breast cancer cell lines and
HeLa cells. Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues revealed
highest expression in brain, with lower expression in mammary gland,
ovary, uterus, prostate, stomach, bladder, spinal cord, and pancreas. In
situ hybridization in mouse tissues demonstrated exclusive expression in
neurons in brain and significant expression in the cortex but not in the
medulla in kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Using GST pull-down assays, Shao et al. (2002) found that NCOA7
demonstrated a low level of ligand-dependent constitutive binding to
ESR1, ESR2 (see 601663), THRB (190160), PPARG (601487), and RARA
(180240). Binding was further induced by the presence of ligands. NCOA7
did not bind to RXRA (180245) in the presence or absence of ligand.
NCOA7 can enhance the transcriptional activity of the nuclear receptors
with which it interacts.

Shao et al. (2002) found that NCOA7 differs from other nuclear receptor
coactivators in that it does not contain an LXXLL receptor-coactivator
interaction motif. Instead it contains a central domain between amino
acids 489 and 559 that mediates ESR1 binding. A leucine at position 523
and/or an isoleucine at position 524 appeared to be essential for the
interaction, and the binding surface appeared to be similar to that of
other coactivators.

GENE STRUCTURE

Shao et al. (2002) demonstrated that the NCOA7 gene contains 15 exons
and spans about 150 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Shao et al. (2002) mapped the NCOA7 gene to
chromosome 6q22.33.

;;CELL DIVISION CYCLE 2-LIKE 5; CDC2L5;;
CELL DIVISION CONTROLLER, CHOLINESTERASE-RELATED; CHED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lapidot-Lifson et al. (1992) cloned a glioblastoma cDNA encoding a
protein related to the S. pombe cdc2 kinase. They designated the
predicted 418-amino acid protein CHED, for cholinesterase-related cell
division controller. The CHED protein shares 34 to 42% sequence identity
with human CDC2 (116940), S. cerevisiae Cdc28, and S. pombe Cdc2, 3
functionally interchangeable proteins. Northern blot analysis revealed
that CHED is expressed as 2.2- to 2.3-kb mRNAs in several fetal tissues
and tumor cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an antisense oligonucleotide, Lapidot-Lifson et al. (1992) found
that reduced CHED expression selectively inhibited megakaryocyte
development in murine bone marrow cultures but did not prevent other
hematopoietic pathways. Antisense mRNA inhibition of BCHE (177400)
expression had a similar effect. The authors suggested that CHED and
BCHE are interrelated components responsive to cholinergic signals in
the hematopoietic pathway. They stated that a link between cholinergic
signaling and cell division might be mediated through individual CDC
proteins in a cell lineage-specific manner.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the CDK13 gene to chromosome 7p14.1 based on an
alignment of the CDK13 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AJ297709) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).
