606091	TITLE *606091 SIALIC ACID-BINDING IMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE LECTIN 10; SIGLEC10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SIGLECs are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily that are expressed
on the cell surface. Most SIGLECs have 1 or more cytoplasmic immune
receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, or ITIMs. SIGLECs are
typically expressed on cells of the innate immune system, with the
exception of the B-cell expressed SIGLEC6 (604405).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences resembling CD33 (SIGLEC3;
159590) and screening a spleen cDNA library, Munday et al. (2001)
isolated a cDNA encoding SIGLEC10. Sequence analysis predicted that the
697-amino acid SIGLEC10 protein contains a signal peptide, an N-terminal
V-set Ig-like domain and 4 C2-set Ig-like domains, 5 potential N-linked
glycosylation sites, a transmembrane region, and a 126-residue
cytoplasmic tail with 3 putative ITIMs. Northern blot analysis detected
a major 3.0-kb SIGLEC10 transcript, with highest levels in spleen, lymph
node, blood leukocytes, and appendix. Little or no expression was
observed in pancreas, thyroid, and testis. Flow cytometric analysis
demonstrated eosinophil-specific expression of SIGLEC10, but at a lower
level than that of SIGLEC8 (605639). Expression was also detected on
monocytes and a CD16 (146740)-positive/CD56-negative natural killer-like
lymphocyte population. After sialidase treatment, which is necessary for
unmasking the sialic acid-binding site on SIGLECs interacting with cell
surface sialic acids, cells expressing SIGLEC10 bound to red blood
cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated expression of a 100- to
120-kD monomeric protein, higher than the predicted molecular mass,
suggesting that SIGLEC10 is glycosylated.

By random sequencing and by comparison with known SIGLEC sequences, Li
et al. (2001) independently cloned SIGLEC10 from a dendritic cell cDNA
library. The cDNA predicted a deduced 607-amino acid protein containing
3 C2-set domains and 3 putative N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot
analysis of multiple human tissues revealed a transcript of about 3.3 kb
in peripheral blood lymphocytes, ovary, and spleen, and a transcript of
about 1.8 kb in liver, spleen, thymus, and lung.

Using the positional candidate cloning approach, Yousef et al. (2001)
identified SIGLEC10 and found that it encodes 3 variants: a deduced
protein of 697 amino acids, a shorter variant missing exon 8, and a
variant with multiple combined exons including intronic sequences.
RT-PCR detected expression of SIGLEC10 primarily in bone marrow, spleen,
brain, small intestine, colon, and spinal cord.

GENE FUNCTION

With use of SIGLEC10-transfected COS-7 cells, Li et al. (2001) found
moderate red blood cell binding and rosette formation that was augmented
by sialidase pretreatment to eliminate sialylated (cis ligands) on the
COS-7 cell surface. With use of polyacrylamide glycoconjugates, they
determined that SIGLEC10 preferentially bound glycoconjugates carrying
sialic acid in either alpha-2,3 or alpha-2,6 linkages, similar to the
binding observed for SIGLEC5 (604200).

Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger (cell
injury)-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) both trigger activation of
the innate immune system. Chen et al. (2009) reported that Cd24
(600074)-deficient mice exhibit increased susceptibility to DAMPs but
not PAMPs. CD24 associates with high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1;
163905), heat shock protein-70 (HSP70; 140550), and heat shock
protein-90 (HSP90; 140571). CD24 negatively regulates their stimulatory
activity and inhibits nuclear factor kappa-B (see 164011) activation.
Chen et al. (2009) reported that this occurs at least in part through
CD24 association with SIGLEC10 in humans or SiglecG in mice. Chen et al.
(2009) concluded that the CD24-SiglecG pathway protects the host against
a lethal response to pathologic cell death and discriminates danger-
versus pathogen-associated molecular patterns.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yousef et al. (2001) determined that the SIGLEC10 gene contains 11 exons
and spans about 6.5 kb.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Munday et al. (2001) mapped the SIGLEC10 gene to 19q13.3,
where it is closely linked to other CD33-related SIGLECs. Yousef et al.
(2001) identified the SIGLEC10 gene on overlapping BAC clones localized
to chromosome 19q13.4. SIGLEC10 lies 278 kb telomeric to SIGLEC9
(605640) and 35 kb centromeric to SIGLEC8.

610955	TITLE *610955 TRAFFICKING PROTEIN PARTICLE COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 3; TRAPPC3
;;BET3, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; BET3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRAPPC3 is a component of the TRAPP complex, which is involved in
tethering of transport vesicles to the cis-Golgi membrane (Turnbull et
al., 2005).

CLONING

Loh et al. (2005) reported that the human TRAPPC3 protein, which they
called BET3, contains 180 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected
Bet3 expression in all mouse tissues examined. Western blot analysis of
fractionated rat liver showed that most Bet3 was present in the
cytosolic fraction, with a lesser amount in the Golgi-enriched membrane
fraction.

By immunohistochemical analysis, Yu et al. (2006) found that endogenous
BET3 showed perinuclear localization in several mammalian cell lines,
including HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Loh et al. (2005) found that antibodies against Bet3 inhibited in vitro
transport of the envelope glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus
from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus of
semi-intact rat kidney cells in a dose-dependent manner. Cytosol
depleted of Bet3 was also defective in this transport and could be
rescued by recombinant Bet3. Bet3 acted after coat protein II (COPII;
see 601924) but before Rab1 (179508), alpha-Snap (NAPA; 603215), and the
EGTA-sensitive stage during ER-Golgi transport.

Turnbull et al. (2005) found that both human and yeast BET3 were
palmitoylated in recombinant yeast cells, but palmitoylation of BET3 was
only partly responsible for the its membrane localization. Both wildtype
yeast Bet3 and mutant yeast Bet3 lacking palmitoylation rescued cell
viability in Bet3-deleted yeast, suggesting that palmitoylation is not
required for cell viability. Despite high sequence conservation, human
BET3 failed to rescue Bet3-deleted yeast.

In mammalian cells, COPII vesicles derived from the transitional ER do
not tether directly to the Golgi, but rather tether to each other to
form vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs). Using various mammalian cell
lines, including HeLa cells, Yu et al. (2006) showed that BET3 resided
in the transitional ER and adjacent to VTCs. Inactivation of BET3
resulted in accumulation of cargo in membranes that colocalized with the
COPII coat. Using an assay that reconstituted VTC biogenesis in vitro,
Yu et al. (2006) demonstrated that BET3 was required for the tethering
and fusion of COPII vesicles to each other. Depletion of BET3 by small
interfering RNA disrupted a VTC marker and Golgi architecture. Yu et al.
(2006) concluded that BET3 is essential for VTC biogenesis.

Cai et al. (2007) reported that in yeast and mammalian cells the
tethering complex TRAPP I binds to the coat subunit SEC23 (see 610511).
This event requires the BET3 subunit. In vitro studies demonstrated that
the interaction between SEC23 and BET3 targets TRAPP I to COPII vesicles
to mediate vesicle tethering. Cai et al. (2007) proposed that the
binding of TRAPP I to SEC23 marks a coated vesicle for fusion with
another COPII vesicle or the Golgi apparatus. An implication of these
findings is that the intracellular destination of a transport vesicle
may be determined in part by its coat and its associated cargo.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Turnbull et al. (2005) determined the crystal structure of human BET3 to
1.55-angstrom resolution. BET3 assumes an alpha/beta-plait topology
constructed by a twisted, antiparallel, 4-stranded beta sheet on one
side, with the 5 alpha helices forming the other side of the structural
motif. BET3 forms a dimer around the crystallographic 2-fold axis. A
hydrophobic pocket within the core of the alpha-helical face contains an
internal palmitate molecule covalently attached through a thioester
linkage to the conserved cys68.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TRAPPC3
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP RH80455).

184755	TITLE *184755 STEROL CARRIER PROTEIN 2; SCP2
;;STEROL CARRIER PROTEIN X; SCPX
DESCRIPTION Sterol carrier protein-2 (SC2) is a peroxisomal enzyme with thiolase
activity that is required for the breakdown of branched-chain fatty
acids (summary by Ferdinandusse et al., 2006).

Sterol carrier protein-2 was the second peroxisomal thiolase to be
identified; see ACAA1 (604054).

CLONING

Yamamoto et al. (1991) used rat SCP2 cDNA to isolate a homologous human
liver SCP2 cDNA. SCP2 encodes a deduced 143-amino acid protein that
shares 89% sequence identity with the rat protein. SCP2 contains a
20-residue N-terminal leader sequence before the mature 13.2-kD
polypeptide, which contains a C-terminal tripeptide related to the
peroxisome targeting sequence. Northern blot analysis identified 2 mRNA
transcripts of 1.8 and 3.2 kb in liver; in fibroblasts and placenta, the
1.8-kb transcript was most abundant.

GENE FUNCTION

Yamamoto et al. (1991) noted that in steroid hormone producing cells
SCP2 is thought to facilitate the transport of cholesterol to
mitochondria, where the first committed step in steroidogenesis takes
place. Yamamoto et al. (1991) demonstrated that coexpression of the SCP2
cDNA with expression vectors for cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme
and adrenodoxin resulted in a 2.5-fold enhancement of progestin
synthesis over that obtained with expression of the steroidogenic enzyme
system alone.

Sterol carrier protein-2 is present in low levels in Zellweger syndrome
(see 214100), in which the cells are deficient in peroxisomes (van
Amerongen et al., 1987).

MAPPING

Yamamoto et al. (1991) used sequences in the 3-prime untranslated region
of the SCP2 cDNA to design PCR primers for use in mapping studies of
human/rodent somatic cell hybrids. In this way, they demonstrated that
the gene is located on the segment 1pter-p21 (He et al., 1991).

Vesa et al. (1994) refined the chromosomal assignment of SCP2 to 1p32 by
analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel by both PCR and hybridization
methods applied to cell lines with various rearrangements of chromosome
1.

By interspecific backcross analysis, Welch et al. (1996) mapped the Scp2
gene to mouse chromosome 4.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with leukoencephalopathy, dystonia, and motor neuropathy
who was found to have deficiency of SCP2, Ferdinandusse et al. (2006)
identified a homozygous 1-nucleotide insertion (545_546insA;
184755.0001) in the SCP2 gene.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY WITH DYSTONIA AND MOTOR NEUROPATHY
SCP2, 1-BP INS, 545A

In a man with leukoencephalopathy with dystonia and motor neuropathy
(613724) and his similarly affected brother, Ferdinandusse et al. (2006)
found homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion of an adenine after nucleotide
position 545 (545_546insA) of the SCP2 gene, leading to a frameshift and
premature stop codon (I184fsX7).

605509	TITLE *605509 INTERLEUKIN 36, ALPHA; IL36A
;;INTERLEUKIN 1 FAMILY, MEMBER 6; IL1F6;;
FAMILY OF INTERLEUKIN 1-EPSILON;;
FIL1-EPSILON
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the IL1 (see IL1A; 147760) family, such as IL1F6, are
structurally related cytokines and cell surface receptors that mediate
inflammation. IL1F6 is part of an IL1 signaling system in epithelia and
has proinflammatory properties (summary by Johnston et al., 2011).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences resembling IL1 and probing a
human genomic library, Smith et al. (2000) identified a cDNA encoding
IL1F6, which they designated FIL1-epsilon. The deduced 158-amino acid
protein, like FIL1-delta (IL1F5; 605507), contains neither a signal
peptide nor a prodomain. It shares 48% sequence identity with FIL1-eta
(IL1F8; 605508). PCR analyses detected expression in immune system and
fetal brain, but not in other tissues tested or in multiple
hematopoietic cell lines. Modeling indicated that FIL1-epsilon has a
conserved 12-stranded beta-trefoil structure.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis, Johnston et al. (2011)
demonstrated increased expression of IL1F5, IL1F6, IL1F8, and IL1F9
(605542) in psoriasis (177900) plaque compared with uninvolved skin from
psoriasis patients. Analysis of 2 mouse psoriasis models produced
similar results. IL1A and TNF (191160) induced expression of the IL1F
transcripts in normal human keratinocytes. Microarray analysis showed
that IL1F cytokines, particularly IL1F8, increased mRNA expression of
human beta-defensins and secretion of HBD2 (DEFB4; 602215) and HBD3
(DEFB103A; 606611). Johnston et al. (2011) concluded that IL1F cytokines
have important roles in inflammatory skin diseases and may be targets
for antipsoriatic therapies.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Smith et al. (2000) mapped the
FIL1-epsilon gene to chromosome 2q between D2S121 and D2S110, where
other members of the IL1 family are located.

Nicklin et al. (2002) determined that the gene order within the IL1 gene
cluster on chromosome 2, from centromere to telomere, is IL1A-IL1B
(147720)-IL1F7 (IL37; 605510)-IL1F9-IL1F6-IL1F8-IL1F5-IL1F10
(615296)-IL1RN (147679). Of these, only IL1A, IL1B, and IL36B are
transcribed toward the centromere.

Gross (2011) mapped the IL1F6 gene to chromosome 2q13 based on an
alignment of the IL1F6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC107043) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

614452	TITLE *614452 ATPASE FAMILY, AAA DOMAIN-CONTAINING, MEMBER 1; ATAD1
;;THORASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the AAA+ ATPase family, such as ATAD1, often performs
chaperone-like functions, including membrane dynamics, protein
transport, and assembly or disassembly of protein complexes. ATAD1
appears to regulate surface expression of AMPA receptors (AMPARs; see
138248) (Zhang et al., 2011).

CLONING

Zhang et al. (2011) cloned rat Atad1, which they named thorase after
Thor, the Norse god of thunder and lightning. By database analysis, they
identified orthologs of thorase in human, mouse, orangutan, and cow. The
deduced thorase proteins from these species all contain 361 amino acids
and are 100% identical except for rat thorase, which has 1 amino acid
substitution. Thorase contains an N-terminal linker domain, followed by
an AAA ATPase domain, which is composed of Walker A and Walker B motifs,
and a C-terminal second region of homology that defines classic AAA
proteins. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected a 3-kb
transcript in most tissues, with highest expression in heart, brain,
thymus, and ovary. Strong expression of a smaller transcript was
detected in testis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed heterogeneous
thorase expression in mouse brain, with relatively strong staining of
hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. Confocal microscopy revealed that
thorase colocalized with postsynaptic markers. Subcellular fractionation
of whole mouse brain showed that thorase segregated with crude
synaptosomes.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2011) showed that rat thorase had ATPase activity and
required both Walker A and B boxes for full activity.
Coimmunoprecipitation of thorase with coexpressed postsynaptic proteins
in HEK293 cells revealed that thorase specifically interacted with the
AMPAR subunits Grip1 (604597) and Glur2 (GRIA2; 138247). Mutation
analysis revealed that the PDZ5 domain of Grip1 and the C terminus of
Glur2 were involved in the interactions with thorase. Overexpression of
thorase in mouse cortical and hippocampal neural cultures reduced the
surface expression of Glur2 and regulated AMPAR surface expression in an
ATPase-dependent manner. Binding of Grip1 and thorase to the Glur2
complex increased in the presence of ATP-gamma-S, a nonhydrolyzable ATP
analog, and the complex disassembled in the presence of ATP and Mg(2+).
Zhang et al. (2011) proposed that thorase acts at GLUR2-GRIP1 complexes
to control the endocytosis and removal of AMPARs from postsynaptic
membranes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the ATAD1 gene to chromosome 10q23.31 based on an
alignment of the ATAD1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK027506) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhang et al. (2011) found that thorase-knockout (KO) mice were viable
but significantly smaller than their wildtype littermates. Most
thorase-KO mice died by postnatal day 25 with seizures associated with
increased AMPA currents. Examination of thorase-KO brains revealed no
substantial abnormalities in dendritic complexity, or number, density,
or size of dendritic spines. However, thorase-KO brains showed elevated
steady-state surface expression of the AMPAR subunits Glur1 (GRIA1;
138248) and Glur2 compared with wildtype littermates. Loss of thorase in
thorase-KO brains resulted in reduced endocytosis of AMPARs, but not of
transferrin receptors (190010). Conditional thorase-KO mice exhibited
seizures and showed deficits in short-term memory and in
hippocampal-dependent spatial working memory.

611321	TITLE *611321 CALSYNTENIN 1; CLSTN1
;;ALCADEIN, ALPHA;;
ALC-ALPHA;;
KIAA0911
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned CLSTN1, which they designated
KIAA0911. The deduced protein contains 981 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected moderate expression in adult kidney and ovary, in adult and
fetal brain, and in all specific brain regions examined. Weaker
expression was detected in heart, lung, and spleen, and little to no
expression wad detected in skeletal muscle, pancreas, and adult and
fetal liver.

Hintsch et al. (2002) reported that the 981-amino acid CLSTN1 protein
contains an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by 2 cadherin (see
192090) repeats, a C-terminal transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic C
terminus. It shares 92% amino acid identity with mouse Clstn1. Northern
blot analysis detected high expression of a 5-kb transcript in brain,
with much lower expression in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and
placenta. In situ hybridization of adult mouse brain revealed that more
than 90% of neurons expressed Clstn1.

Araki et al. (2007) stated that the cytoplasmic domain of CLSTN1
contains 2 tryptophan- and aspartic acid (WD)-rich sequences separated
by an asparagine-proline (NP) motif and an acidic region.

GENE FUNCTION

Vogt et al. (2001) found that a proteolytically cleaved N-terminal
Clstn1 fragment localized in the postsynaptic membrane of both
excitatory and inhibitory synapses in chicken and rodents. Proteolytic
cleavage of Clstn1 in its extracellular region generated a transmembrane
stump that was internalized and accumulated in the spine apparatus of
spine synapses. The cytoplasmic domain of mouse Clstn1 bound Ca(2+),
suggesting that CLSTN1 may modulate Ca(2+)-mediated postsynaptic
signaling and that this modulation may be regulated by extracellular
proteolysis.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis and protein pull-down assays, Konecna et
al. (2006) showed that mouse Clstn1 interacted directly with kinesin
light chain-1 (KLC1; 600025). Mutation analysis revealed that the
cytoplasmic domain of Clstn1 bound the tetratricopeptide repeats of
Klc1. Immunoelectron microscopy located Clstn1 in association with
tubulovesicular organelles in mouse axonal fiber tracts. In primary
neuronal cultures, Calstn1-containing organelles were aligned along
microtubules and partially colocalized with kinesin-1. These
Clstn1-containing organelles were transported along axons with a
velocity and processivity typical for fast axonal transport. Point
mutations in the 2 kinesin-binding segments of Clstn1 significantly
reduced binding to Klc1 in vitro, and vesicles bearing mutated Clstn1
exhibited markedly altered anterograde axonal transport.

By yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, Araki et al.
(2007) showed that mouse and human ALC-alpha interacted with KLC1. The
interaction required the C-terminal WD-containing sequence of ALC-alpha.
Using cultured mouse neurons, Araki et al. (2007) found that Alc-alpha
induced kinesin-1 association with vesicles and functioned as a novel
cargo in axonal anterograde transport. Transport of Alc-alpha-containing
vesicles competed with that of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP;
104760)-containing vesicles for kinesin-1, and disruption of transport
of APP-containing vesicles increased amyloid-beta generation.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hintsch et al. (2002) mapped the CLSTN1
gene to chromosome 1p36. They mapped the mouse Clstn1 gene to chromosome
4.

612905	TITLE *612905 LIPOCALIN 12; LCN12
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the lipocalin family, such as LCN12, have a common structure
consisting of an 8-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel that forms a
cup-shaped ligand-binding pocket or calyx. Lipocalins generally bind
small hydrophobic ligands and transport them to specific cells (Suzuki
et al., 2004).

CLONING

Suzuki et al. (2004) cloned mouse Lcn12, which encodes a deduced
193-amino acid protein. They identified human LCN12 by database
analysis. Northern blot analysis detected Lcn12 expression in mouse
epididymis only. Lcn12 expression was detected in mouse epididymis at
all postnatal ages examined, with increased expression at 3 weeks of
age.

GENE FUNCTION

Suzuki et al. (2004) found that expression of Lcn12 in mouse epididymis
decreased after castration and was restored by testosterone
administration.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Suzuki et al. (2004) mapped the LCN12 gene
to an LCN gene cluster on chromosome 9q34. They mapped the mouse Lcn12
gene to a syntenic region of mouse chromosome 2A3.

600050	TITLE *600050 MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE KINASE KINASE 11; MAP3K11
;;MIXED-LINEAGE PROTEIN KINASE 3; MLK3;;
PROTEIN-TYROSINE KINASE PTK1; PTK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using RT-PCR and cDNA library screening, Ing et al. (1994) identified
MAP3K11, a novel protein kinase, from human thymus. The deduced open
reading frame, derived from sequencing a 3.5-kb MAP3K11 cDNA, encodes a
protein of 847 amino acids. Structural features include an SH3 domain in
the absence of an SH2 domain, a region containing 2 leucine zippers with
an adjacent C-terminal basic region, and a proline rich region. The
kinase showed homology with the mixed-lineage family of protein kinases
(MLKs) and shared the unusual leucine zipper-basic motif found in
previously identified MLK kinases; Ing et al. (1994) therefore called
the protein MLK3. By Northern blot analysis, MAP3K11 mRNA was detected
in a wide variety of normal and transformed human cell lines and
tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Using small interfering RNA (siRNA), Chadee and Kyriakis (2004) found
that MLK3 was required for both mitogen and cytokine activation of JNK
(see MAPK8; 601158), ERK (see MAPK3; 601795), and p38 (MAPK14; 600289)
in several human cell lines. Silencing MLK3 substantially blocked
serum-stimulated phosphorylation of RB1 (614041) in intestinal and lung
fibroblast cell lines, and it prevented serum-simulated proliferation of
tumor cells bearing oncogenic KRAS2 (190070) or loss-of-function NF1
(613113) or NF2 (607379) mutations. Proliferation of tumor cells bearing
activating RAF1 (164760) or BRAF (164757) mutations was unaffected by
MLK3 silencing. Chadee and Kyriakis (2004) also observed some cell
type-specific effects of MLK3 silencing, and murine Mlk3 siRNA, which
differs from the 21-bp human siRNA at 2 positions, did not silence MLK3
in human cells.

Consistent with the observation that MLK3 is required for BRAF
phosphorylation, Chadee et al. (2006) found that silencing MLK3 in human
embryonic kidney cells completely abrogated mitogen activation of BRAF,
but MLK3 kinase activity was not required for BRAF activation.
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments identified MLK3 as a component of the
BRAF/RAF1 complex, and MLK3 was required for integrity of the complex
and for activation of ERK by the complex. Mlk3 interacted with Nf2 in
rodent cells, and Nf2 disrupted protein-protein interactions within the
Braf/Raf1/Mlk3 complex. Chadee et al. (2006) concluded that MLK3 is a
signal-integrating kinase with conventional MAP3K catalytic activity and
additional noncatalytic functions that contribute to RAF/ERK signaling.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ing et al. (1994) mapped the
MAP3K11 gene to chromosome 11q13.1-q13.3. Courseaux et al. (1996) used a
combination of methods to refine maps of the approximately 5-Mb region
of 11q13 that includes MEN1 (131100). They proposed the following gene
order:
cen--PGA--FTH1--UGB--AHNAK--ROM1--MDU1--CHRM1--COX8--EMK1--FKBP2--PLCB3--[PYGM,
ZFM1]--FAU--CAPN1--[MAP3K11, RELA]--FOSL1--SEA--CFL1--tel.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Velho et al. (2010) screened 174 primary gastrointestinal cancers (48
hereditary and 126 sporadic forms) and 7 colorectal cancer cell lines
for MLK3 mutations. MLK3 mutations were significantly associated with
microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype in primary tumors (p =
0.0005), occurring in 21% of the MSI carcinomas. Most MLK3 somatic
mutations identified were of the missense type (62.5%), and more than
80% of them affected evolutionarily conserved residues. A predictive 3D
model demonstrated that MLK3 missense mutations clustered in the kinase
domain but probably affected scaffold properties rather than kinase
activity. MLK3 missense mutations showed transforming capacity in vitro,
and cells expressing the mutant gene were able to develop locally
invasive tumors when subcutaneously injected in nude mice. In primary
tumors, MLK3 mutations occurred in KRAS and/or BRAF wildtype carcinomas,
although not being mutually exclusive genetic events.

;;KIAA0899
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomly sequencing cDNA clones from size-fractionated human brain
cDNA libraries, Nagase et al. (1998) identified AP2A2, which they
designated KIAA0899. The deduced 929-amino acid protein shares more than
97% sequence identity with rat alpha-adaptin. By RT-PCR analysis
followed by ELISA for quantitation, they detected ubiquitous,
low-to-moderate expression of KIAA0899, with highest levels in spinal
cord and fetal and adult brain and lowest levels in spleen.

Using the N terminus of huntingtin (HTT; 613004) in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a testis cDNA library, Faber et al. (1998) identified AP2A2,
which they designated huntingtin yeast partner J (HYPJ). The predicted
protein shares significant sequence identity with mouse alpha-adaptin C.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the AP2A2 gene
to chromosome 11.

613486	TITLE *613486 MICRO RNA 33B; MIR33B
;;miRNA33B;;
MIRN33B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNA genes whose final
product is an approximately 22-nucleotide functional RNA molecule. They
play important roles in the regulation of target genes by binding to
complementary regions of messenger transcripts to repress their
translation or regulate degradation (summary by Griffiths-Jones et al.,
2006).

Two genes encoding miR33 isoforms exist in humans: miR33B, which is
present in intron 17 of the SREBP1 (184756) gene on chromosome 17, and
miR33A (612156), which is located in intron 16 of the SREBP2 (600481)
gene on chromosome 22. In mice, however, there is only 1 miR33 gene,
which is conserved with human miR33A, located within intron 15 of the
mouse Srebp2 gene. The mature miR33A and miR33B miRNAs differ at only 2
nucleotides. One of the targets of both miR33A and miR33B is the
cholesterol transporter ABCA1 (600046) (Najafi-Shoushtari et al., 2010).

CLONING

During an investigation of gene regulation by sterol regulatory
element-binding proteins (SREBPs), Najafi-Shoushtari et al. (2010)
identified the miR33B gene within intron 17 of the SREBP1 gene.
Najafi-Shoushtari et al. (2010) gave the sequence of mature miR33B as
GUGCAUUGCUGUUGCAUUGC. Using quantitative RT-PCR, they found that miR33B
was expressed in all human tissues examined, with highest levels in
brain, ovary, liver, prostate, heart, and cervix. Najafi-Shoushtari et
al. (2010) noted that miR33B appeared to be coexpressed with its host
gene, SREBP1.

MAPPING

The MIR33B gene resides on chromosome 17p11.2, within intron 17 of the
SREBP1 gene (Najafi-Shoushtari et al., 2010).

GENE FUNCTION

The sterol regulatory element-binding proteins SREBP1 and SREBP2 are key
transcription regulators of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis
and uptake. Najafi-Shoushtari et al. (2010) demonstrated that miRNA33A
and miRNA33B, embedded within introns of the SREBP2 and SREBP1 genes,
respectively, target adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter
A1 (ABCA1), an important regulator of high density lipoprotein (HDL)
synthesis and reverse cholesterol transport, for posttranscriptional
repression. Antisense inhibition of miRNA33 in mouse and human cell
lines caused upregulation of ABCA1 expression and increased cholesterol
efflux, and injection of mice on a western-type diet with locked nucleic
acid-antisense oligonucleotides resulted in elevated plasma HDL.
Najafi-Shoushtari et al. (2010) concluded that miRNA33 acts in concert
with the SREBP host genes to control cholesterol homeostasis.

MiR33A and miR33B are intronic miRNAs whose encoding regions are
embedded in the sterol response element-binding protein genes SREBF2 and
SREBF1, respectively. These miRNAs repress expression of the cholesterol
transporter ABCA1, which is a key regulator of HDL biogenesis. Studies
in mice suggested that antagonizing miR33a may be an effective strategy
for raising plasma HDL levels and providing protection against
atherosclerosis; however, extrapolating these findings to humans is
complicated by the fact that mice lack miR33b, which is present only in
the SREBF1 gene of medium and large mammals. Rayner et al. (2011) showed
in African green monkeys that systemic delivery of an anti-miRNA
oligonucleotide that targets both miR33a and miR33b increased hepatic
expression of ABCA1 and induced a sustained increase in plasma HDL
levels over 12 weeks. Notably, miR33 antagonism in this nonhuman primate
model also increased the expression of miR33 target genes involved in
fatty acid oxidation (CROT, 606090; CPT1A, 600528; HADHB, 143450; and
PRKAA1, 602739) and reduced the expression of genes involved in fatty
acid synthesis (SREBF1; FASN, 600212; ACLY, 108728; and ACACA, 200350),
resulting in a marked suppression of the plasma levels of very low
density lipoprotein (VLDL)-associated triglycerides, a finding that had
not previously been observed in mice. Rayner et al. (2011) concluded
that their results established, in a model that is highly relevant to
humans, that pharmacologic inhibition of miR33a and miR33b is a
promising therapeutic strategy to raise plasma HDL and lower VLDL
triglyceride levels for the treatment of dyslipidemias that increase
cardiovascular disease risk.

EVOLUTION

Brown et al. (2010) noted that the miR33A/B genes exhibit a remarkable
degree of evolutionary conservation. The precursor for mature miR33A is
found within the same intron of SREBP2 from many animal species,
including large and small mammals, chickens, and frogs. There is even a
perfectly conserved mature form of miR33A in the single SREBP-like gene
of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The latter is most remarkable
because insects do not synthesize sterols; their single SREBP gene
controls fatty acid production. Moreover, the fruit fly genome does not
contain ABCA1. In contrast to the uniform conservation of miR33A in
SREBP2, there is a gap in the evolutionary conservation of miR33B in
SREBP1. The SREBP1 genes from large mammals encode miR33B, but there is
no trace of miR33b in the Srebp1 genes of small mammals (rats and mice)
or chickens.

605240	TITLE *605240 CHEMOKINE, CC MOTIF, LIGAND 28; CCL28
DESCRIPTION For background information on chemokines, see CCL27 (SCYA27; 604833).

CLONING

By searching an EST database using a consensus chemokine sequence, Wang
et al. (2000) identified ESTs encoding CCL28. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 127-amino acid CCL28 protein contains a 22-amino acid
N-terminal signal peptide. Northern blot analysis detected 0.8-, 1.3-,
and 6.0-kb CCL28 transcripts predominantly in prostate, colon, spleen,
and to a lesser degree in peripheral blood leukocytes.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected CCL28 expression in epithelial
cells of normal colon. Quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated high
expression of CCL28 in cDNA libraries derived from organs where
epithelial cells are localized, including samples from ulcerative
colitis (see 266600) tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analysis by Wang et al. (2000) showed that CCL28 is
chemotactic for resting CD4 (186940) and CD8 (see 186910) T cells and
fails to mobilize calcium in cells expressing known CC chemokine
receptors (CCRs, e.g., CCR9; 604738) or CXC chemokine receptors (CXCRs,
e.g., BLR1; 601613). Wang et al. (2000) determined that CCL28 does
mobilize calcium in cells expressing CCR10 (GPR2; 600240), which it
shares with the skin chemokine, CCL27.

Wilson and Butcher (2004) found that Ccl28 was upregulated in mouse
mammary gland during lactation and that IgA antibody-secreting cells
(ASCs) in the gland expressed Ccr10 and migrated to Ccl28. Antibody to
Ccl28 blocked IgA ASC accumulation in mammary gland, inhibiting
secretion of IgA into milk and the appearance of antibody in the
gastrointestinal tract of nursing neonatal mice. Wilson and Butcher
(2004) proposed that CCL28 is a key regulator of IgA ASC accumulation in
the mammary gland and thereby controls passive transfer of IgA
antibodies from mother to infant.

Facciabene et al. (2011) showed that tumor hypoxia promotes the
recruitment of regulatory T (Treg) cells through induction of expression
of the chemokine CCL28, which in turn promotes tumor tolerance and
angiogenesis. Facciabene et al. (2011) concluded that peripheral immune
tolerance and angiogenesis programs are closely connected and cooperate
to sustain tumor growth.

MAPPING

Wang et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Ccl28 gene to the distal region of
chromosome 13, which shows homology of synteny to human 5q. The authors
noted that this localization would place CCL28 outside the CCL cluster
in chromosome 17. Scott (2000) mapped the CCL28 gene to chromosome 5
based on sequence similarity between the CCL28 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
AF220210) and the chromosome 5 clones CTD-2202K16 (GenBank GENBANK
AC025457), CTD-2282F8 (GenBank GENBANK AC010465), and CTD-2201J22
(GenBank GENBANK AC022132).

B-CELL STIMULATORY FACTOR 3; BSF3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CLCF1 belongs to the interleukin-6 (IL6; 147620) family of cytokines,
which are involved in cell signaling through phosphorylation of gp130
(IL6ST; 600694). IL6 family members share similarity in gene structure
and have a 4-helix bundle in their protein structure.

CLONING

Senaldi et al. (1999) cloned BSF3, which they also referred to as novel
neurotrophin-1 (NNT1), by subtractive hybridization using a cDNA library
prepared from phorbol ester-activated Jurkat T cells. The deduced
protein contains 225 amino acids, including a 27-amino acid signal
peptide. The mature form is predicted to be a 198-amino acid peptide
with a molecular mass of 22 kD. BSF3 contains 4 cysteine residues, 2 of
which are in the signal peptide, and 1 potential N-linked glycosylation
site. The secondary structure is predicted to contain alpha helices.
BSF3 shares 19 to 27% homology with other IL6 family members and 96%
homology with mouse Bsf3. Northern blot analysis revealed a 2.2-kb
transcript expressed predominantly in lymph nodes, spleen, peripheral
blood lymphocytes, bone marrow, and fetal liver. Northern blot analysis
of mouse tissues revealed strongest expression in lymph nodes, spleen,
liver, lung, uterus, and ovary. N-terminal amino acid analysis of BSF3
expressed in HEK293 cells confirmed removal of the signal peptide.

Using cardiotrophin-1 (CTF1; 600435) as query in a database search, Shi
et al. (1999) identified a full-length clone of CLC. CLC shares 29%
identity with CTF1 and 20 to 26% identity with other neuropoietic
cytokines. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.9-kb transcript expressed
at high levels in spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes, at moderate
levels in ovary, placenta, and kidney, and at low levels in colon,
heart, lung, and pancreas. The transcript in lung was slightly smaller
than that in other tissues. Shi et al. (1999) also detected CLC clones
in cDNA libraries prepared from activated or resting neutrophils, bone
marrow stromal cells, and synovial fibroblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

Senaldi et al. (1999) found that treatment of human neuroblastoma cells
with recombinant BSF3 resulted in phosphorylation of gp130, LIFR-beta
(151443), and STAT3 (102582). BSF3 supported the survival of chick
embryo motor and sympathetic neurons in culture in a dose-dependent
manner and induced growth of murine myeloid leukemia cells. Treatment of
mice with recombinant BSF3 increased the level of serum amyloid A
(104750), potentiated the induction of corticosterone and IL6 by IL1
(see 147760), and caused body weight loss and B-cell hyperplasia with
elevated serum IgG and IgM levels.

Shi et al. (1999) found that recombinant CLC induced the activation of
NFKB (see 164011) and SRE reporter constructs in several mammalian cell
lines. The signal transduction pathway for CLC was characterized in a
neuroblastoma cell line, and tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 and STAT1
(600555), but not STAT3, was detected.

GENE STRUCTURE

Senaldi et al. (1999) determined that the CLCF1 gene contains 3 exons
and spans approximately 6 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In an Australian man with cold-induced sweating syndrome (CISS2;
610313), Rousseau et al. (2006) identified compound heterozygosity for a
truncating (607672.0001) and a missense mutation (607672.0002) in the
CLCF1 gene. The mutations were not found in 140 control chromosomes.

In 2 Hungarian sisters with CISS2, Hahn et al. (2010) identified
compound heterozygous mutations in the CLCF1 gene (607672.0003 and
607672.0004).

MAPPING

By FISH, Senaldi et al. (1999) mapped the CLCF1 gene to chromosome
11q13. By radiation hybrid analysis, Shi et al. (1999) mapped the CLCF1
gene to chromosome 11q13.3.

In an Australian man with cold-induced sweating syndrome-2 (CISS2;

321C-A transversion and a 590G-T transversion in the CLCF1 gene,
resulting in a tyr107-to-ter (Y107X) and an arg197-to-leu (R197L;
607672.0002) substitution, respectively. The mutations were not found in
140 control chromosomes. Transfection studies demonstrated that
truncated CLC containing a stop codon at position 107 cannot be
correctly processed and expressed in mammalian cells. Functional studies
of R197L CLC revealed an incapacity for the mutant protein to bind to
CNTFR (118946) and activate subsequent signaling events; structural and
docking interaction studies showed that the R197L substitution
destabilized the contact site between CLC and CNTFR.

607283	TITLE *607283 LSM3 PROTEIN; LSM3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sm-like proteins were identified in a variety of organisms based on
sequence homology with the Sm protein family (see SNRPD2; 601061).
Sm-like proteins contain the Sm sequence motif, which consists of 2
regions separated by a linker of variable length that folds as a loop.
The Sm-like proteins are thought to form a stable heteromer present in
tri-snRNP particles, which are important for pre-mRNA splicing.

CLONING

In a search for human Sm-like proteins, Achsel et al. (1999)
fractionated proteins present in purified (U4/U6.U5) tri-snRNPs and
isolated 7 Sm-like proteins, which they named LSm2-LSm8. Using partial
peptide sequence for database searches, they identified and sequenced
EST clones. Using additional sequence obtained by PCR amplification of a
HeLa cDNA library, they assembled full-length cDNA sequences for
LSM2-LSM8.

Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999) searched database sequence for Sm proteins
and identified 16 potential Sm-related genes in yeast as well as some
Sm-related genes in human and archaebacteria. Using a multiple sequence
alignment of Sm domains, they built a phylogenetic tree of yeast, human,
and archaeal Sm and Sm-like proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Using electron-microscopy, Achsel et al. (1999) observed that purified
LSm proteins form a heteromer that is stable even in the absence of RNA
and exhibits a doughnut-shaped structure similar to the Sm core RNP
structure. They demonstrated that the purified LSm heteromer binds
specifically to the U6 snRNA at its 3-prime-terminal U-tract. They also
showed that the LSm proteins facilitate the formation of U4/U6 RNA
duplexes in vitro and concluded that the LSm proteins may play a role in
U4/U6 snRNP formation.

Using immunoprecipitation experiments, Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
concluded that there is a complex of 7 Sm-like proteins bound to RNA in
yeast. Lsm2-Lsm8 coprecipitate the U4, U5 and U6 snRNAs and directly
associate with the U6 snRNA present in the free U6 snRNP. Additionally,
the yeast Lsm2-Lsm7 proteins were found to be associated with the
pre-RNase P RNA but not the mature RNase RNA. Using immunoprecipitation
experiments from human cell extracts, Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
showed that the LSM3 and LSM4 proteins are specifically associated with
snRNP complexes containing the U6 snRNA. Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
concluded that Sm and Sm-like proteins assemble in at least 2
functionally conserved complexes of deep evolutionary origin.

By disrupting the Sm and Sm-like genes in yeast, Salgado-Garrido et al.
(1999) concluded that disruption of genes encoding Sm-like proteins
directly associated with the U6 snRNA (Lsm2-8) generated variable
phenotypes. Lsm2, Lsm3, Lsm4, and Lsm8 are essential for vegetative
growth. Lsm5, Lsm6, and Lsm7 are not essential for growth; however,
their disruptions lead to slow growth especially at elevated
temperature. The levels of the U6 snRNA were strongly reduced in the
strains harboring the Lsm5, Lsm6, and Lsm7 disruptions. Lsm1 and Lsm9
are dispensable for vegetative growth, but Lsm1 is required for optimal
vegetative growth at 30 degrees and is temperature sensitive.

Ingelfinger et al. (2002) determined that human LSM1 to LSM7, but not
LSM8, were expressed in HeLa cells within cytoplasmic foci. The foci
also contained a decapping enzyme (DCP1/2) and the exonuclease XRN1
(607994). Coexpression of wildtype and mutant LSM proteins, as well as
fluorescence resonance energy transfer, indicated that the LSM proteins
form a complex similar to one found in yeast. Ingelfinger et al. (2002)
concluded that the foci contain a partially or fully assembled machinery
for the degradation of mRNA.

MAPPING

Scott (2002) mapped the LSM3 gene to chromosome 3p25.1 based on sequence
similarity between the LSM3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF182289) and a
genomic contig (GenBank GENBANK AC021022).

;;8D6 ANTIGEN; 8D6; 8D6A;;
TRANSCOBALAMIN RECEPTOR; TCBLR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CD320 antigen gene encodes the transcobalamin receptor (TCBLR).
Cellular uptake of cobalamin (vitamin B12) is mediated by receptors
expressed on the cell surface. Transcobalamin II (TCN2; 613441), a
plasma protein secreted by endothelial cells, binds the cobalamin
absorbed in the distal ileum and carries 10 to 30% of total circulating
cobalamin. CD320 encodes a transcobalamin receptor that binds
TCN2-cobalamin at the plasma membrane and internalizes the complex by
endocytosis (Quadros et al., 2009).

CLONING

B cells undergo clonal expansion in germinal centers (GCs) dependent on
initial contact with follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) as well as T
cells expressing CD40L (300386). Using monoclonal antibodies against FDC
clusters from tonsils, Li et al. (2000) identified an antibody,
designated 8D6, that inhibited the GC reaction. By expression cloning
methods using an FDC cell line, Li et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA
encoding 8D6. The predicted 282-amino acid protein possesses a signal
sequence, a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The
extracellular region of 8D6 has 2 type A cysteine-rich repeats
homologous to those of LDLR (606945) family members; the 2 repeats are
interrupted by 4 pro residues and an N-glycosylation site. Northern blot
analysis showed wide expression of 8D6 in different tissues.

By affinity chromatography, SDS-PAGE, and database analysis, Quadros et
al. (2009) isolated a 58-kD transcobalamin receptor identical to CD320,
which the authors called TCBLR. The 282-amino acid protein has an
N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a 199-residue extracellular
domain, a 21-residue transmembrane sequence, and a 32-amino acid
cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular domain contains 18 cys residues
that are part of 2 LDLR class A domains, and TCBLR contains 3 potential
N-glycosylation sites and numerous possible O-glycosylation sites. TCBLR
has a calculated molecular mass of 29 kD. The 58-kD size by SDS-PAGE
suggests extensive glycosylation of the membrane-anchored protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Quadros et al. (2009) determined that the CD320 gene spans 6.2 kb and
contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Quadros et al. (2009) mapped the CD320
gene to chromosome 19p13.2. They mapped the mouse Cd320 gene to
chromosome 17B1.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analysis by Li et al. (2000) indicated that expression of 8D6
enhanced B-cell proliferation and immunoglobulin secretion. Treatment of
the FDC cell line and a lymphoma cell line coculture with anti-8D6
resulted in at least partial inhibition of lymphoma growth. Li et al.
(2000) proposed that antagonists of the 8D6 signaling pathway may
counter the growth of follicular lymphomas or other tumors that
metastasize to lymphoid follicles.

Quadros et al. (2009) found that mouse embryonic stem cells lacking
Tcblr exhibited reduced binding of TCN2, whereas binding was increased
in HEK293 cells transfected with TCBLR cDNA. Quadros et al. (2009)
concluded that TCBLR is a specific receptor for uptake of TCN2-bound
cobalamin.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Quadros et al. (2010) identified a homozygous mutation in the CD320 gene
(606475.0001) in an infant with methylmalonic aciduria due to a defect
in the transcobalamin receptor (613646). The infant was asymptomatic and
identified by newborn screening. Treatment with intramuscular
administration of vitamin B12 restored serum MMA levels to normal, but
the long-term effects of the condition could not be ascertained.
Biochemical studies on patient fibroblasts were consistent with a defect
in the cobalamin receptor. Studies of 4 additional cell lines derived
from patients with similar features identified the same mutation; 2 of
these additional patients had increased serum homocysteine.

In an infant with methylmalonic aciduria (613646) detected by newborn
screening, Quadros et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 3-bp deletion
(262delGAG) in the CD320 gene, resulting in an in-frame deletion of
glu88 in the 3-prime end of the first LDLR type A domain. Newborn
screening identified increased blood C3-acylcarnitine levels, and
urinary analysis showed moderately elevated MMA. Plasma vitamin B12 and
total homocysteine levels were normal. Repeat screening on day 14 of
life showed normal C3-acylcarnitine levels and increased MMA; vitamin
B12 was administered intramuscularly, and MMA returned to normal. All
hematologic parameters were normal, and the mother had no laboratory
abnormalities. Studies of patient fibroblasts showed increased levels of
MMA and homocysteine compared to control cells, but these levels
decreased in the presence of high levels of cobalamin. Patient
fibroblasts showed low uptake of transcobalamin-bound cobalamin, but
normal conversion to adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin, suggesting a
defect in the receptor. Insertion of the missing codon by site-directed
mutagenesis fully restored TCBLR function. Studies of 4 additional cell
lines derived from patients with similar features identified the same
mutation; 2 of these additional patients had increased serum
homocysteine.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the CELF family, such as CELF1, play various roles in
cotranscriptional and posttranscriptional RNA processing. All CELF
proteins appear to affect pre-mRNA splicing, but individual CELFs have
divergent roles in regulating mRNA stability and translation (summary by
Wagnon et al., 2012).

CLONING

An unstable CTG triplet repeat expansion in the DMPK gene (605377) is
responsible for myotonic dystrophy (DM1; 160900). To detect proteins
that bind to CTG triplet repeats, Timchenko et al. (1996) performed
bandshift analysis using as probes double-stranded DNA fragments having
CTG repeats and single-stranded oligonucleotides having CTG repeats or
RNA CUG repeats. The proteins were derived from nuclear and cytoplasmic
extracts of HeLa cells, fibroblasts, and myotubes. Proteins binding to
the double-stranded DNA repeat were inhibited by the nonlabeled repeat
but not by a nonspecific DNA fragment. Another protein binding to the
single-stranded CTG probe and the RNA CUG probe was inhibited by
nonlabeled CTG(8) and CUG(8) repeats. The protein binding only to the
RNA repeat (CUG)8 was inhibited by nonlabeled (CUG)8 but not by
nonlabeled single- or double-stranded CTG repeats. Furthermore, the
protein, designated CUG-binding protein (CUGBP) by the authors,
exhibited no binding to an RNA oligonucleotide of triplet repeats of the
same length but having a different sequence, CGG. The CUG-binding
protein was localized to the cytoplasm, whereas double-stranded DNA
binding proteins were localized to the nuclear extract. Thus, Timchenko
et al. (1996) concluded that several trinucleotide-binding proteins
exist and their specificity is determined by the triplet sequence.

CTG trinucleotide repeats encode CUG repeat regions in the corresponding
mRNAs. Timchenko et al. (1996) identified 2 proteins, termed CUGBP1 and
CUGBP2, that bind specifically to CUG repeats in RNA. They suggested
that these 2 proteins, with masses of 49 kD and 51 kD, respectively, are
isoforms encoded by the same gene. Timchenko et al. (1996) cloned a
gene, termed NAB50 by them, based on the interaction between its protein
product and the yeast Nab2 protein. The authors stated that the NAB50
gene encodes the CUGBP1 and CUGBP2 proteins because anti-Nab50
antibodies crossreacted with both CUGBP isoforms. The gene predicts a
482-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 52 kD. The
predicted protein contains 3 RNA-binding domains and is homologous to
the hnRNPs.

Good et al. (2000) identified CUGBP1 as BRUNOL2, a member of a human
gene family related to the transcriptional regulator 'Bruno' of
Drosophila. By PCR, they cloned BRUNOL2 from a brain cDNA library. The
deduced protein contains 2 N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), a
long linker region, and a C-terminal RRM. BRUNOL2 and BRUNOL3 (CUGBP2;
602538) share 80% amino acid identity overall and more than 92% identity
in their RRMs. Good et al. (2000) determined that the BRUNOL2 cDNA and
the CUGBP1 cDNA reported by Timchenko et al. (1996) differ in their
3-prime UTRs due to alternative splicing. Good et al. (2000) also
identified a BRUNOL2 splice variant with an additional 12 bp, resulting
in a 4-amino acid insertion in the linker region. Northern blot analysis
detected variable expression of 3 major BRUNOL2 transcripts of about
9.5, 7.5, and 2.4 kb in all tissues examined.

Using RNA dot blot analysis, Ladd et al. (2004) confirmed ubiquitous
expression of CUGBP1.

GENE FUNCTION

Timchenko et al. (1996) showed that the NAB50 gene product bound the CUG
repeat region of DMPK.

Using 2 biologic systems with reduced DMPK levels, a homozygous DM
patient and DMPK knockout mice, Roberts et al. (1997) demonstrated that
the intracellular distribution of CUGBP isoforms was altered in the
absence of DMPK. DMPK phosphorylated the CUGBP protein in vitro,
suggesting regulation of nuclear CUGBP localization via phosphorylation.

Using ultraviolet light crosslinking and gel mobility shift assays, Good
et al. (2000) showed that BRUNOL2 bound RNA containing a BRUNO response
element (BRE).

Dudaronek et al. (2007) showed that Ifnb (147720) induced expression of
Lip, a truncated, dominant-negative isoform of Cebpb (189965), and
suppressed active simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication in
macaque macrophages. In a human monocyte cell line, IFNB induced
phosphorylation of CUGBP1 and formation of CUGBP1-CEBPB mRNA complexes.
Depletion of Cugbp1 in macaque macrophages via small interfering RNA
showed that Cugbp1 was required for Ifnb-mediated induction of Lip and
for Ifnb-mediated suppression of SIV replication. Dudaronek et al.
(2007) concluded that CUGBP1 is a downstream effector of IFNB signaling
in primary macrophages that plays an important role in innate immune
responses controlling acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or SIV
replication in brain.

A transgenic fly model of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome
(FXTAS; 300623) in which the 5-prime UTR of human FMR1 (309550)
containing 90 CGG repeats is expressed specifically in the eye results
in disorganized ommatidia, depigmentation, and progressive loss of
photoreceptor neurons. Sofola et al. (2007) found that overexpression of
human CUGBP1 suppressed the neurodegenerative eye phenotype in
transgenic flies. CUGBP1 did not interact directly with the CGG repeats,
but did so via HNRNPA2B1 (600124). Expression of the A2 isoform of human
HNRNPA2B1, or the Drosophila orthologs, also suppressed the eye
phenotype of FXTAS flies. CUGBP1 did not interact with other HNRNPs
examined.

Tang et al. (2012) observed altered splicing of the calcium channel
subunit CAV1.1 (CACNA1S; 114208) in muscle of patients with DM1 and DM2
(602668) compared with normal adult muscle and muscle of patients with
facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD; see 158900). A significant
fraction of CAV1.1 transcripts in DM1 and DM2 muscle showed skipping of
exon 29, which represents a fetal splicing pattern. Forced exclusion of
exon 29 in normal mouse skeletal muscle altered channel gating
properties and increased current density and peak electrically evoked
calcium transient magnitude. Downregulation of Mbnl1 (606516) in mouse
cardiac muscle or overexpression of Cugbp1 in mouse tibialis anterior
muscle enhanced skipping of exon 29, suggesting that these splicing
factors may be involved in the CAV1.1 splicing defect in myotonic
dystrophy.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Good et al. (2000) mapped the CUGBP1 gene
to chromosome 11p11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wang et al. (2007) generated an inducible and heart-specific mouse model
of DM1 that expressed expanded human DMPK CUG-repeat RNA and
recapitulated pathologic features of the human disorder, including
dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and systolic and diastolic
dysfunction. The mice also showed misregulation of developmental
alternative splicing transitions, including the Tnnt2 (191045) and Fxr1
(600819) genes. All died of heart failure within 2 weeks.
Immunohistochemical studies showed increased CUGBP1 protein levels
specifically in nuclei containing foci of DMPK CUG-repeat RNA. A
time-course study showed that increased CUGBP1 cooccurred within hours
of induced expression of the CUG repeat and coincided with reversion to
embryonic splicing patterns. The results indicated that increased CUGBP1
is a specific and early event of DM1 pathogenesis and represents a
primary response to expression of DMPK CUG-repeat mutant RNA.

Koshelev et al. (2010) expressed human CUGBP1 in adult mouse heart.
Upregulation of CUGBP1 was sufficient to reproduce molecular,
histopathologic, and functional changes observed in a DM1 mouse model
that expressed expanded CUG RNA repeats (Wang et al., 2007) as well as
in individuals with DM1. The authors concluded that CUGBP1 upregulation
plays an important role in DM1 pathogenesis.

By inducing expression of human CUGBP1 in adult skeletal muscle of
transgenic mice, Ward et al. (2010) showed that the pathogenic features
of DM1 could be explained by upregulated CUGBP1 expression. Within weeks
of induction of CUGBP1 expression, transgenic mice exhibited impaired
movement, reduced muscle function, abnormal gait, and reduced total body
weight compared with uninduced controls. Histologic analysis of
transgenic muscle overexpressing CUGBP1 revealed centrally located
nuclei, myofiber degeneration with inflammatory infiltrate, and pyknotic
nuclear clumps. RT-PCR analysis revealed reversion to embryonic splicing
patterns in several genes in transgenic muscle overexpressing CUGBP1.
Ward et al. (2010) concluded that CUGBP1 has a major role in DM1
skeletal muscle pathogenesis.

602862	TITLE *602862 UDP-N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINE PYROPHOSPHORYLASE 1; UAP1
;;SPERM-ASSOCIATED ANTIGEN 2; SPAG2;;
ANTIGEN X; AgX
DESCRIPTION The correlation of humoral antisperm antibodies with some cases of
unexplained infertility in male and female patients suggests a role for
these antibodies in blocking fertilization. Diekman and Goldberg (1994)
reported that antigen X (AgX) was originally identified by screening a
human testis cDNA expression library with a pool of sera from male and
female patients presenting at an infertility clinic. Several clinical
tests determined that the individual sera contained antisperm
antibodies. Diekman and Goldberg (1994) isolated cDNAs encoding 2
isoforms of AgX, designated AgX1 and AgX2, from human testis and
placenta cDNA libraries, respectively. Compared with the coding sequence
of AgX1, the AgX2 coding sequence contains a 48-bp insertion which
encodes 16 amino acids in the C-terminal region. The authors suggested
that the AgX1 and AgX2 cDNAs represent alternatively spliced AgX
transcripts. Northern blot analysis detected an abundant, approximately
2.3-kb AgX transcript in testis and a slightly higher molecular mass
transcript in placenta. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that both AgX
mRNAs were expressed in all tissues examined but at varying relative
amounts. The predicted 505-amino acid AgX1 and 521-amino acid AgX2
proteins are globular and cytosolic, and contain motifs indicative of
nucleotide binding. Western blot analysis using antibodies against AgX
detected approximately 56- and 58-kD proteins in human testis and sperm
extracts; only the 58-kD protein was found in placenta, skeletal muscle,
and seminal plasma. These masses correlated well with the calculated
masses of 55.5 kD and 57.3 kD for AgX1 and AgX2, respectively.
Immunofluorescence analysis of human sperm localized AgX to the
principal piece of the tail, the neck region of the head, and, to a
lesser extent, the midpiece of the tail.

Mio et al. (1998) cloned a human UDP-N-acetylglucosamine
pyrophosphorylase-1 (UAP1) cDNA and found that it was identical to the
AgX1 cDNA isolated by Diekman and Goldberg (1994). UAP1 catalyzes the
final step of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) biosynthesis from
fructose-6-phosphate. In eukaryotes, UDP-GlcNAc is used in the GlcNAc
moiety of N-linked glycosylation and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchor of cellular proteins.

614953	TITLE *614953 SCHLAFEN FAMILY, MEMBER 11; SLFN11
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Schlafen (SFLN) family contains 9 mouse and 6 human genes that
encode proteins with a conserved N terminus containing a putative AAA
ATPase domain. Longer SLFN proteins, such as SLFN11, have C-terminal
motifs resembling DNA/RNA helicase domains. Studies in mouse have
implicated SLFN proteins in regulation of cell growth and T-cell
development (summary by Geserick et al. (2004) and Li et al. (2012)).

CLONING

Geserick et al. (2004) identified mouse Slfn5 (614952), Slfn8, Slfn9,
and Slfn10, which encode proteins that share significant homology with
mouse Slfn1 through Slfn4 in their N-terminal halves, but contain unique
C-terminal extensions with motifs homologous to DNA/RNA helicases.
Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10 share 85 to 87% amino acid identity with one
another, whereas Slfn5 is more distantly related to the former group,
sharing 40% identity.

Van Zuylen et al. (2011) noted that human SLFN11 and SLFN13 (614957) are
orthologous to mouse Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10.

Li et al. (2012) stated that the 901-amino acid human SLFN11 protein has
an AAA domain in its N-terminal half and a putative helicase sequence in
its C-terminal half. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that SLFN5 and SLFN11
were the most prominently expressed SLFN family members in several human
cell lines.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the SLFN11 gene to chromosome 17q12 based on an
alignment of the SLFN11 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC052586) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Bustos et al. (2009) found that the SLFN genes are clustered within the
same orthologous region flanked by the UNC45 (UNC45B; 611220) and PEX12
(601758) genes in all mammalian genomes examined. The human and mouse
SLFN clusters are located on chromosomes 17 and 11, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (2012) noted that levels of mouse SLFN proteins are elevated
after infection with Brucella or Listeria. Using quantitative RT-PCR,
they showed that lipopolysaccharide, poly-IC, or interferon (IFN)-alpha
(147660)/beta (147640) treatment of murine macrophages resulted in
induction of several SLFN genes. Treatment of human foreskin fibroblasts
with IFN-beta, poly-IC, or poly-dAdT revealed similar induction of SLFN
genes, including SLFN5 and SLFN11. Li et al. (2012) found that human
SLFN11, but not SLFN5, potently and specifically abrogated production of
retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see 609423),
and diminished the number of viral particles released from cells. The
inhibitory activity resided in the 579-residue N-terminal half of
SLFN11, which includes the AAA domain. Rather than affecting early steps
of the retroviral infection cycle, including reverse transcription,
integration, and transcription, SLFN11 selectively inhibited expression
of viral proteins in a codon-usage-dependent manner. SLFN11 bound tRNA
and counteracted changes in the tRNA pool elicited by HIV. Li et al.
(2012) concluded that SLFN11 is a potent, IFN-inducible restriction
factor against retroviruses that mediates its antiviral effects on the
basis of codon usage discrimination.

- Putative Mouse Orthologs of SLFN11

Using Northern blot analysis, Geserick et al. (2004) detected expression
of most mouse SLFN genes examined in Listeria monocytogenes-infected
mouse splenocytes, with little or no expression in uninfected mouse
cells. Ifngr (107470) was required for Slfn5, Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10
upregulation. Further analysis showed that mouse SLFNs were
differentially regulated in developing thymocytes, in activated
peripheral T cells, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or interferon-gamma
(IFNG; 147570)-activated macrophages, or during terminal myeloid
differentiation of M1 leukemia cells. Transgenic expression in mice
revealed that dysregulated expression of Slfn8 negatively influenced
thymocyte development and impaired the response of peripheral T cells to
T-cell receptor (see 186880)-mediated stimulation. Geserick et al.
(2004) concluded that SLFN genes are integrated into regulatory networks
that control T-cell development and activation.

EVOLUTION

Bustos et al. (2009) used genomic and phylogenetic studies to
investigate the evolution and role of the SLFN gene family. They found
that the SLFN family is widely distributed in mammals, with 4 major
clades that underwent lineage-specific expansions or contractions in
various orders, including primates and rodents. Bustos et al. (2009)
also identified SLFN family members in Chondrichthyes and Amphibia. They
found evidence that positive selection has acted on many SLFN genes. A
member of the SLFN family was horizontally transferred from mouse to
orthopoxviruses, where the authors hypothesized it plays a role in
allowing the virus to survive host defense mechanisms. The viral SLFN
sequences are evolving under purifying selection, indicating their
functional relevance.

Van Zuylen et al. (2011) noted that only 2 SLFN family members, SLFN5
and SLFN14 (614958), have direct orthologs in mouse and human,
consistent with rapid evolution of the SLFN family across mammalian
species. Human SLFN12 (614955) and SLFN12L (614956) have 4 orthologs in
mice (Slfn1, Slfn2, Slfn3, and Slfn4), and human SLFN11 and SLFN13 have
3 orthologs in mice (Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10).

602170	TITLE *602170 MYELOID DIFFERENTIATION PRIMARY RESPONSE GENE 88; MYD88
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MyD88 is a key downstream adapter for most Toll-like receptors (TLRs)
and interleukin-1 receptors (IL1Rs) (summary by Von Bernuth et al.,
2008).

CLONING

The myeloid differentiation (MyD) marker MyD88 was first characterized
during a study of the early genetic responses of murine myeloid cells to
various differentiation and growth inhibitory stimuli (Lord et al.,
1990). Myeloid differentiation primary response genes are activated in
M1 myeloleukemic cells in response to interleukin-6 (IL6; 147620), which
induces both growth arrest and terminal differentiation. Hardiman et al.
(1997) described the cloning of the mouse MyD88 gene. The first exon
encodes a complete 'death domain' similar to the intracellular segment
of TNF receptor-1 (191190). Zoo-blot analysis demonstrated that it is an
evolutionarily conserved gene. Northern blot analysis revealed
widespread expression of the gene in many adult mouse tissues, and
RT-PCR detected MyD88 mRNA in T- and B-cell lines and differentiating
embryonic stem cells. The broad expression pattern demonstrated that
mouse Myd88 expression is not restricted to cells of myeloid lineage as
was originally believed.

Bonnert et al. (1997) cloned a human MYD88 cDNA that encodes a 296-amino
acid polypeptide with a predicted mass of 33 kD. MYD88 shares 81% amino
acid identity with murine MyD88. The 150-amino acid C-terminal region
has significant homology to the type I interleukin-1 receptor (147810)
cytoplasmic domain. Northern blot analysis revealed that human MYD88 is
expressed as 2 MYD88 hybridizing 1.6- and 3-kb mRNAs in a variety of
tissues and cell lines.

Using immunofluorescence analysis, Kagan and Medzhitov (2006) found that
human MYD88 localized to discrete foci scattered throughout the cytosol
of transfected mouse embryonic fibroblasts and macrophages.

GENE FUNCTION

Bonnert et al. (1997) found that overexpression of MYD88 caused an
increase in the level of transcription from the interleukin-8 (146930)
promoter.

Muzio et al. (1997) reported that the C-terminal domain of MYD88 has
significant sequence similarity to the cytoplasmic domain of IL1RAP
(602626). They showed that ectopic expression of MYD88 strongly induced
NFKB (e.g., 164011) activity in a concentration-dependent manner. In
addition, the C-terminal region of MYD88 acted as a dominant-negative
inhibitor of IL1R1 (147810)/IL1RAP-induced NFKB activity. MYD88 formed
an immunoprecipitable complex with IL1RAP and with IRAK2 (603304).

Medzhitov et al. (1998) demonstrated that signaling by the human TOLL
receptor (see TLR4; 603030) employs an adaptor protein, MyD88, and
induces activation of NFKB via the IRAK (IRAK1; 300283) kinase and the
TRAF6 (602355) protein. The Toll-mediated signaling cascade using the
NFKB pathway is essential for immune responses in adult Drosophila, and
a human homolog of the Drosophila Toll protein induces various immune
response genes via this pathway. These findings implicate MyD88 as a
general adaptor/regulator molecule for the Toll/IL1R family of receptors
for innate immunity.

Hayashi et al. (2001) showed that expression of TLR5 (603031) induces
NFKB (see 164011) activation and TNFA (191160) production.
Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) known to stimulate other
TLR family members failed to stimulate TLR5; however, luciferase
reporter assays indicated TLR5 activation in gram-positive and -negative
bacterial culture supernatants. By fractionation of Listeria culture
supernatants followed by SDS-PAGE, Hayashi et al. (2001) identified
flagellin as the TLR5 ligand. Flagellin, a principal component of
bacterial flagella, is a virulence factor recognized by the innate
immune system in plants, insects, and mammals. Expression of flagellin
in nonflagellated bacteria resulted in TLR5 activation, and deletion of
flagellin from flagellated bacteria abrogated TLR5 activation. Hayashi
et al. (2001) demonstrated that injection of flagellin induces the
production of IL6 (147620) in wildtype mice, but not in those lacking
the MyD88 adaptor protein, required for TLR signaling. Hayashi et al.
(2001) concluded that TLR5 is a pattern-recognition receptor and that
its PAMP is flagellin, a protein with conserved N and C termini in a
broad group of motile pathogens.

Burns et al. (2003) noted that a MYD88 splice variant encodes a protein,
MYD88s, lacking the 58-amino acid intermediary domain between the death
domain and the C-terminal TIR domain. MYD88s is detected only after
continuous stimulation with bacterial products, such as
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or proinflammatory cytokines. Expression of
MYD88s blocks LPS- or IL1-induced NFKB activation, even though, like the
full-length protein, MYD88s binds both IL1R and IRAK1. By Western blot
analysis of a reconstituted MYD88 -/- cell line, Burns et al. (2003)
showed that MYD88, but not MYD88s, triggered IRAK1 phosphorylation and
NFKB activation in an IRAK4 (606883)-dependent manner. MYD88s did not
bind IRAK4 and blocked its recruitment to IL1Rs. Burns et al. (2003)
concluded that MYD88s acts as a negative regulator of IL1R/TLR/MYD88
signals, leading to a controlled negative regulation of innate immune
responses.

Diebold et al. (2004) confirmed that mouse plasmacytoid dendritic cells
(PDCs) expressing B220 (PTPRC; 151460) but not Cd11b (ITGAM; 120980)
were resistant to suppression of Ifna (147660) production mediated by
influenza virus NS1 protein, suggesting that PDCs use a
dsRNA-independent pathway for recognizing influenza. Chloroquine
inhibited influenza-induced Ifna production, indicating that recognition
of the virus occurs in the endosomal compartment. Ifna production in
response to live or inactivated influenza virus or to viral genomic or
host ssRNA required the presence of Myd88 and Tlr7 (300365), but not
other TLRs.

Kagan and Medzhitov (2006) found that human TIRAP (606252), a TLR
adaptor protein, recruited human MYD88 to the plasma membrane of
transfected mouse fibroblasts and macrophages. They proposed that TIRAP
functions primarily to recruit MYD88 to activated TLR4 to initiate
signal transduction.

Chen et al. (2007) found that the acute neutrophilic inflammatory
response to cell injury requires the signaling protein Myd88. Analysis
of the contribution of Myd88-dependent receptors to this response
revealed only a minor reduction in mice doubly deficient in Toll-like
receptor-2 (Tlr2; 603028) and Tlr4 (603030) and normal responses in mice
lacking Tlr1 (601194), Tlr3 (603029), Tlr6 (605403), Tlr7 (300365), Tlr9
(605474), or Tlr11 (606270) or the IL18 receptor (IL18R; 604494).
However, mice lacking IL1R (147810) showed a markedly reduced
neutrophilic inflammatory response to dead cells and tissue injury in
vivo as well as greatly decreased collateral damage from inflammation.
This inflammatory response required IL1-alpha (147760), and IL1R
function was required on non-bone-marrow-derived cells. Notably, the
acute monocyte response to cell death, which is thought to be important
for tissue repair, was much less dependent on the IL1R-Myd88 pathway.
Also, this pathway was not required for the neutrophil response to a
microbial stimulus. These findings suggested that inhibiting the
IL1R-MYD88 pathway in vivo could block the damage from acute
inflammation that occurs in response to sterile cell death, and do so in
a way that might not compromise tissue repair or host defense against
pathogens.

Cirl et al. (2008) showed that virulent bacteria, such as uropathogenic
E. coli and Brucella melitensis, secreted inhibitory homologs of TIR
domain-containing proteins (TCPs). These TCPs promoted intracellular
bacterial survival and kidney pathology after instillation of organisms
in mouse bladder. Bacterial TCPs impeded TLR signaling through MYD88 and
impaired innate host defense. Molecular epidemiologic analysis of
clinical isolates from patients with urinary tract infections further
supported the proposal that bacterial TCPs represent a class of
virulence factors.

Alu RNA accumulation due to DICER1 (606241) deficiency in retinal
pigmented epithelium (RPE) is implicated in geographic atrophy, an
advanced form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD; see 603075).
Using mouse and human RPE cells and mice lacking various genes, Tarallo
et al. (2012) showed that a DICER1 deficit or Alu RNA exposure activated
the NLRP3 (606416) inflammasome, triggering TLR-independent MYD88
signaling via IL18 (600953) in the RPE. Inhibition of inflammasome
components, MYD88, or IL18 prevented RPE degeneration induced by DICER1
loss or Alu RNA exposure. Because RPE in human geographic atrophy
contained elevated NLRP3, PYCARD, and IL18, Tarallo et al. (2012)
suggested targeting this pathway for prevention and/or treatment of
geographic atrophy.

Zhu et al. (2012) showed that the direct, immediate, and disruptive
effects of IL1-beta (IL1B; 147720) on endothelial stability in a human
in vitro cell model are NF-kappa-B (see 164011)-independent and are
instead the result of signaling through the small GTPase
ADP-ribosylation factor-6 (ARF6; 600464) and its activator ARF
nucleotide-binding site opener (ARNO; 602488). Moreover, Zhu et al.
(2012) showed that ARNO binds directly to the adaptor protein MYD88, and
thus proposed MYD88-ARNO-ARF6 as a proximal IL1-beta signaling pathway
distinct from that mediated by NF-kappa-B. Finally, Zhu et al. (2012)
showed that SecinH3 (182115), an inhibitor of ARF guanine nucleotide
exchange factors such as ARNO, enhances vascular stability and
significantly improves outcomes in animal models of inflammatory
arthritis and acute inflammation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hardiman et al. (1997) described the gene structure of the mouse MyD88
gene. The complete coding sequence spans 5 exons.

Bonnert et al. (1997) found that the human MYD88 gene is encoded by 5
exons.

MAPPING

By interspecific backcross mapping, Hardiman et al. (1997) localized the
mouse MyD88 gene to chromosome 9; the human homolog was mapped to
3p22-p21.3 by PCR analysis of a chromosome 3 somatic cell hybrid mapping
panel. Bonnert et al. (1997) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to
map the human MYD88 gene to 3p22-3p21.3.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Lin et al. (2010) reported the crystal structure of the MyD88-IRAK4
(606883)-IRAK2 (603304) death domain complex, which revealed a
left-handed helical oligomer that consists of 6 MyD88, 4 IRAK4, and 4
IRAK2 death domains. Assembly of this helical signaling tower is
hierarchical, in which MyD88 recruits IRAK4 and the MyD88-IRAK4 complex
recruits the IRAK4 substrates IRAK2 or the related IRAK1. Formation of
these myddosome complexes brings the kinase domains of IRAKs into
proximity for phosphorylation and activation. Composite binding sites
are required for recruitment of the individual death domains in the
complex, which are confirmed by mutagenesis and previously identified
signaling mutations. Specificities of myddosome formation are dictated
by both molecular complementation and correspondence of surface
electrostatics.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Von Bernuth et al. (2008) identified 3 different mutations in the MYD88
gene in children with MYD88 deficiency (612260) that resulted in
susceptibility to pyogenic bacterial infections. Four children from 3
kindreds were homozygous for in-frame deletion of glu52 (E52del;
602170.0001). Two sibs were homozygous for an arg196-to-cys (R196C;
602170.0002) mutation, and 1 child from another kindred was compound
heterozygous for the R196C mutation and a leu93-to-pro (L93P;
602170.0003) mutation. Two sibs who died in infancy were presumably
homozygous for the same E52del mutation found in their surviving
brother. The mutations were not found in healthy controls, and all
affected conserved residues. Fibroblast from patients representing the 3
combinations of mutant MYD88 alleles showed normal MYD88 mRNA levels.
Western blot analysis revealed low MYD88 protein levels with the
homozygous E52del mutation and the compound heterozygous L93P/R196C
mutation and normal MYD88 protein levels with the R196C homozygous
mutation. Functional analysis using patient fibroblasts and expression
of wildtype or mutant alleles in cell lines confirmed that all 3 MYD88
mutations resulted in loss of function and led to complete MYD88
deficiency. Von Bernuth et al. (2008) concluded that, like IRAK4
deficiency (607676), MYD88 deficiency abolishes most cytokine responses
to TLR stimulation. Von Bernuth et al. (2008) noted that the immunologic
phenotype of the 9 children they reported with MYD88 deficiency was
similar to that of Myd88-deficient mice, but the infectious phenotype
was different. The MYD88-deficient patients were susceptible to
Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus
pneumoniae, but were normally resistant to most other infectious agents.
In contrast, Myd88-deficient mice had been shown to be susceptible to
almost all pathogens tested.

of undetermined significance (MGUS) and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia,

ANIMAL MODEL

Adachi et al. (1998) observed that mice with a targeted disruption of
the Myd88 gene were unable to respond to IL1 (e.g., 147760), as
determined by defective T-cell proliferation and the production of
cytokines. Likewise, Myd88-deficient mice were unable to produce
gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) and mediate natural killer cell activity
in response to IL18 (600953). NFKB activation in response to IL1 or IL18
was also impaired. These results indicated that MYD88 is a critical
component in the IL1R and IL18R (604494) signaling cascades. Kawai et
al. (1999) extended these studies to show that responses to
lipopolysaccharide, mediated by TLR4 and CD14 (158120), were lost or
delayed in Myd88-deficient mice, establishing that MYD88 is part of the
TLR signaling cascade as well, acting just upstream of IRAK.

Takeuchi et al. (2000) showed that Tlr2 (603028)- and, particularly,
Myd88-deficient mice are highly susceptible, in terms of growth in blood
and kidney and decreased survival, to infection with Staphylococcus
aureus compared to wildtype mice. In vitro, Tlr2-deficient macrophages
produced reduced TNF and interleukin-6 (IL6; 147620) in response to S.
aureus compared to wildtype or Tlr4-deficient macrophages, whereas
Myd88-deficient macrophages produced no detectable TNF or IL6. The
authors concluded that TLR2 and MYD88 are critical in the defense
against gram-positive bacteria.

Skerrett et al. (2004) found that Myd88-deficient mice were highly
susceptible to aerosol infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not to
aerosol infection with S. aureus. They concluded that Myd88-dependent
signaling is essential for innate immunity to P. aeruginosa and is
dispensable for resistance to pulmonary S. aureus infection.

Using nonlethal microbial stimuli on Il12b (161561)-deficient mice,
Jankovic et al. (2002) showed that although Th1-type cytokine production
was diminished in the absence of Il12b, the pathogen-specific Cd4
(186940)-positive T cells that emerged nevertheless displayed an
Ifng-dominated lymphokine profile and failed to default to a Th2
phenotype. In mice lacking both Il12b and Il10 (124092), these Th1 cells
were protective. In contrast, in mice lacking Myd88, not only was a
normal Th2-type response to Schistosoma mansoni antigens developed, but,
in response to Toxoplasma gondii antigens, no Ifng was detected and the
mice defaulted to a Th2-type response. Jankovic et al. (2002) proposed
that microbial-induced Th1 polarization is determined during the initial
encounter of pathogens with pattern recognition receptors (e.g., TLRs)
on antigen-presenting cells. They concluded that IL12, however, does not
determine Th1 versus Th2 phenotype.

LaRosa et al. (2008) generated bone marrow chimeras in which T cells,
but not cells involved in innate immune responses, lacked Myd88. These
chimeric mice showed increased susceptibility to T. gondii disease,
developing fatal encephalitis within 30 days. They displayed reduced
Ifng production, and the increased susceptibility was independent of
Il1r and Il18r signaling. LaRosa et al. (2008) proposed that, in
addition to innate immunity, MYD88 expression is necessary in T cells
for prolonged resistance to pathogens.

Bjorkbacka et al. (2004) examined atherosclerotic lesion development in
uninfected Apoe (APOE; 107741) single-null mice and Apoe -/- Myd88 -/-
double-null mice, and found that the Myd88-deficient mice showed a
marked reduction in early atherosclerosis. Inactivation of the Myd88
pathway led to a reduction in atherosclerosis through a decrease in
macrophage recruitment to the artery wall that was associated with
reduced chemokine levels. The findings linked elevated serum lipid
levels to a proinflammatory signaling cascade that is also engaged by
microbial pathogens.

To examine whether Toll-like receptor signaling regulates phagocytosis,
Blander and Medzhitov (2004) compared macrophages from wildtype, Myd88
null, and Tlr2-Tlr4 (603030) double-null mice. Myd null and Tlr2-Tlr4
double-null macrophages were unresponsive to inactivated E. coli.
Blander and Medzhitov (2004) found that activation of the Toll-like
receptor signaling pathway by bacteria, but not apoptotic cells,
regulated phagocytosis at multiple steps including internalization and
phagosome maturation. Phagocytosis of bacteria was impaired in the
absence of Toll-like receptor signaling. Two modes of phagosome
maturation were observed, constitutive and inducible; their differential
engagement depended on the ability of the cargo to trigger Toll-like
receptor signaling.

Fremond et al. (2004) noted that previous investigations had suggested a
minor and redundant role for TLR2, TLR4, and TLR6 (605403) in the early
host response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, but a more
important role in control of chronic infection. Using Myd88 -/- mice,
Fremond et al. (2004) investigated the role of MYD88, which most TLRs,
except TLR3 (603029), use as an intracellular adaptor, in resistance to
Mtb. Macrophages from Myd88 -/- mice had normal upregulation of
costimulatory molecules but reduced cytokine production in response to
Mtb infection. Myd88 -/- mice succumbed to a low-dose aerosol Mtb
infection in approximately 4 weeks, whereas Tnf -/- mice died within 3
weeks, and wildtype mice survived. Death was accompanied by
significantly reduced body weight, increased lung weight, and 2 logs
higher bacillary burden. Like Tnf -/- mice, Myd88 -/- mice developed
massive necrosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells, primarily
neutrophils and macrophages, in lungs. Although BCG vaccination failed
to elicit a delayed-type hypersensitivity response in Myd88 -/- mice, it
did induce antigen-specific Ifng production in splenocytes and also
protected the mice from acute Mtb infection. The Myd88 -/- mice could
not, however, durably control the infection. Fremond et al. (2004)
concluded that the MYD88-mediated signaling pathway is critically
involved in the development of innate, but not adaptive, immunity in
response to Mtb infection.

Using mice lacking Myd88 or various members of the IL1R/TLR superfamily,
Bellocchio et al. (2004) found that the Myd88-dependent pathway was
required for resistance to Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus.
Myd88 signaling could occur through distinct TLRs depending on the
fungal pathogen and the route of infection, and individual TLRs
activated specialized antifungal effector functions on neutrophils.
Myd88-dependent signaling in dendritic cells was crucial for priming the
antifungal Th1 response. Bellocchio et al. (2004) concluded that innate
and adaptive immunity to C. albicans and A. fumigatus requires the
coordinated action of distinct members of the IL1R/TLR superfamily
acting through MYD88.

To evaluate the role of TLRs in B-cell activation and antibody
production, Pasare and Medzhitov (2005) transferred purified B cells
from wildtype, Myd88-deficient, Tlr4-deficient, and Cd40
(109535)-deficient mice into B cell-deficient mu-MT mice, which have a
mutation in the Ighm gene (147020). They found that primary B-cell
activation, including induction of IgM, IgG1, and IgG2 responses, but
not IgE or, probably, IgA responses, required TLRs in addition to helper
T cells. In contrast, Cd40 was required for isotype switching.

Hyaluronan, an extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan with a repeating
disaccharide structure, is produced after tissue injury, and impaired
clearance results in unremitting inflammation. Jiang et al. (2005) noted
that CD44 (107269) is essential for regulating turnover of hyaluronan,
but it is not required for expression of chemokines by macrophages after
lung injury. Using Tlr-deficient mouse macrophages, they found that
hyaluronan fragments stimulated Mip2 (CXCL2; 139110), Mip1a (CCL3;
182283), and Kc (CXCL1; 155730) in a Tlr2- and Tlr4-dependent manner
that also required Myd88. Mice deficient in Tlr2, Tlr4, or Myd88 showed
impaired transepithelial migration of inflammatory cells, but decreased
survival and enhanced epithelial cell apoptosis after lung injury. Lung
epithelial cell overexpression of high molecular mass hyaluronan
protected against acute lung injury and apoptosis, in part, through
TLR-dependent basal activation of NFKB. Jiang et al. (2005) concluded
that interaction of TLR2 and TLR4 with hyaluronan provides signals that
initiate inflammatory responses, maintain epithelial cell integrity, and
promote recovery from acute lung injury.

Mice genetically deficient in both Myd88 and Trif (607601) have a
complete lack of known Toll-like receptor signaling, thus allowing
assessment of Toll-like receptor dependence of antibody responses. Gavin
et al. (2006) used these double knockouts to investigate the role of
Toll-like receptor signaling in antibody responses to immunization and
the augmenting roles of 4 typical adjuvants (alum, Freund complete
adjuvant, Freund incomplete adjuvant, and monophosphoryl-lipid
A/trehalose dicorynomycolate adjuvant) to that response. Regardless of
adjuvant, these mice exhibited robust antibody responses. Gavin et al.
(2006) concluded that Toll-like receptor signaling does not account for
the action of classical adjuvants and does not fully explain the action
of strong adjuvant containing a Toll-like receptor ligand.

Brown et al. (2007) found that Myd88 -/- mice and Ptgs2 -/- mice
exhibited a profound inhibition of endothelial proliferation and
cellular organization within rectal crypts after injury. The effects of
injury in both mutant mouse strains could be rescued by exogenous
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), suggesting that Myd88 signaling is upstream of
Ptgs2 and PGE2. In wildtype mice, the combination of injury and Myd88
signaling led to repositioning of a subset of Ptgs2-expressing stromal
cells from the mesenchyme surrounding the middle and upper crypts to an
area surrounding the crypt base adjacent to colonic epithelial
progenitor cells. Brown et al. (2007) concluded that the MYD88 and
prostaglandin signaling pathways interact to preserve epithelial
proliferation during injury, and that proper cellular mobilization
within the crypt niche is critical to repair after injury.

Apc (611731) Min/+ mice spontaneously develop intestinal tumors and, on
average, die within 6 months of age. Rakoff-Nahoum and Medzhitov (2007)
showed that deletion of Myd88 in Min/+ mice reduced morbidity and
mortality, as well as the size and numbers of intestinal polyps,
compared with sex- and age-matched controls. They concluded that
MYD88-dependent signaling controls the expression of several key
modifier genes of intestinal tumorigenesis and that MYD88 has a critical
role in both spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumor development.

Wen et al. (2008) showed that specific pathogen-free NOD mice lacking
Myd88, an adaptor for multiple innate immune receptors that recognize
microbial stimuli, do not develop type 1 diabetes (222100). The effect
is dependent on commensal microbes because germ-free Myd88-negative NOD
mice develop robust diabetes, whereas colonization of these germ-free
Myd88-negative NOD mice with a defined microbial consortium
(representing bacterial phyla normally present in human gut) attenuates
type 1 diabetes. Wen et al. (2008) also found that Myd88 deficiency
changes the composition of the distal gut microbiota, and that exposure
to the microbiota of specific pathogen-free Myd88-negative NOD donors
attenuates type 1 diabetes in germ-free NOD recipients. Wen et al.
(2008) concluded that, taken together, their findings indicated that
interaction of the intestinal microbes with the innate immune system is
a critical epigenetic factor modifying type 1 diabetes predisposition.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYD88 DEFICIENCY
MYD88, 3-BP DEL, 160GAG

Von Bernuth et al. (2008) identified a homozygous in-frame 3-bp (GAG)
deletion in exon 1 of the MYD88 gene, resulting in deletion of glu52
(E52del), in 4 children with functional MYD88 deficiency (612260). A
French patient with the E52del mutation died in infancy. Two sibs of a
Spanish Gypsy patient with the mutation also died in infancy and were
presumed to have the mutation. The surviving patients were 3.5 to 7
years old. All patients shared a history of susceptibility to pyogenic
bacterial infections caused by S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, or S.
pneumoniae. Functional analysis confirmed that the E52del mutation
resulted in loss of function.

.0002
MYD88 DEFICIENCY
MYD88, ARG196CYS

Von Bernuth et al. (2008) identified a homozygous 586C-T transition in
exon 3 of the MYD88 gene, resulting in an arg196-to-cys (R196C)
substitution, in 2 sibs from Portugal with functional MYD88 deficiency
(612260). These patients were 9 and 16 years old. Von Bernuth et al.
(2008) also identified an unrelated, 3-year-old patient from Turkey who
was compound heterozygous for the R196C mutation and a 278T-C transition
in exon 1 that resulted in a leu93-to-pro (L93P; 602170.0003)
substitution. All 3 patients shared a history of susceptibility to
pyogenic bacterial infections caused by S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, or S.
pneumoniae. Functional analysis confirmed that both mutations resulted
in loss of function.

MYD88, LEU265PRO (dbSNP rs38182641)

Ngo et al. (2011) described the dependence of activated B cell-like
(ABC) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCLs) on MYD88 and the discovery
of highly recurrent oncogenic mutations affecting MYD88 in ABC DLBCL
tumors. RNA interference screening revealed that MYD88 and the
associated kinases IRAK1 (300283) and IRAK4 (606883) are essential for
ABC DLBCL survival. High-throughput RNA resequencing uncovered MYD88
mutations in ABC DLBCL lines. Notably, 29% of ABC DLBCL tumors harbored
the same amino acid substitution, L265P, in the MYD88 Toll/IL1 receptor
(TIR) domain at an evolutionarily invariant residue in its hydrophobic
core. This mutation was rare or absent in other DLBCL subtypes and
Burkitt lymphoma (113970), but was observed in 9% of mucosa-associated
lymphoid tissue lymphomas. At a lower frequency, additional mutations
were observed in the MYD88 TIR domain, occurring in both the ABC and
germinal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL subtypes. Survival of ABC DLBCL
cells bearing the L265P mutation was sustained by the mutant but not the
wildtype MYD88 isoform, demonstrating that L265P is a gain-of-function
driver mutation. The L265P mutant promoted cell survival by
spontaneously assembling a protein complex containing IRAK1 and IRAK4,
leading to IRAK4 kinase activity, IRAK1 phosphorylation, NF-kappa-B (see
164011) signaling, JAK kinase (see 147795) activation of STAT3 (102582),
and secretion of IL6 (147620), IL10 (124092), and interferon-beta
(147640). Hence, Ngo et al. (2011) concluded that the MYD88 signaling
pathway is integral to the pathogenesis of ABC DLBCL, supporting the
development of inhibitors of IRAK4 kinase and other components of this
pathway for the treatment of tumors bearing oncogenic MYD88 mutations.

Treon et al. (2012) performed whole-genome sequencing of bone marrow
lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) cells in 30 patients with Waldenstrom
macroglobulinemia (153600), with paired normal-tissue and tumor-tissue
sequencing in 10 patients. Sanger sequencing was used to validate the
findings from an expanded cohort of patients with LPL, those with other
B-cell disorders that have some of the same features as LPL, and healthy
donors. Among the patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, Treon et
al. (2012) identified a somatic mutation, L265P (dbSNP rs38182641), in
samples from all 10 patients with paired tissue samples and in 17 of 20
samples from patients with unpaired samples. This T-to-C transition
predicted an amino acid change that triggers IRAK-mediated NF-kappa-B
signaling. Sanger sequencing identified MYD88 L265P in tumor samples
from 49 of 54 patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and in 3 of 3
patients with non-IgM-secreting lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) (91% of
all patients with LPL). MYD88 L265P was absent in paired normal-tissue
samples from patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia or non-IgM LPL
and in B cells from healthy donors and was absent or rarely expressed in
samples from patients with multiple myeloma, marginal-zone lymphoma, or
IgM monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance. Inhibition of MYD88
signaling reduced I-kappa-B-alpha (164008) and NF-kappa-B p65 (164014)
phosphorylation, as well as NF-kappa-B nuclear staining, in Waldenstrom
macroglobulinemia cells expressing MYD88 L265P. Similar results were
obtained when cells expressing MYD88 L265P were incubated with an
IRAK1/4 kinase inhibitor. Somatic variants in ARID1A (603024) in 5 of 30
patients (17%), leading to a premature stop or frameshift, were also
identified and were associated with an increased disease burden. In
addition, 2 of 3 patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia who had
wildtype MYD88 had somatic variants in MLL2 (602113). Treon et al.
(2012) concluded that MYD88 L265P is a commonly recurring mutation in
patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia that can be useful in
differentiating Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and non-IgM LPL from
B-cell disorders that have phenotypic overlap.

Landgren and Staudt (2012) used Sanger sequencing to assess the status
of MYD88 L265P expression in patients with IgM monoclonal gammopathy of
undetermined significance (MGUS) and found expression of this variant in
5 of 9 patients. All of these patients had both clonal plasma cells and
clonal lymphocytes in bone marrow (lymphoplasmacytic precursor
neoplasm), suggesting to Landgren and Staudt (2012) that this mutation
is a precursor to Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia rather than
transformation from IgM MGUS to Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. Treon et
al. (2012) commented that, to overcome the limitations of Sanger
sequencing, they developed an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction
(AS-PCR) assay to detect the MYD88 L265P mutation with a threshold
detection limit of 0.1% (approximately 100-fold better than that of
Sanger sequencing). They found that 88 of 96 patients with Waldenstrom
macroglobulinemia (92%) and 5 of 11 patients with IgM MGUS (45%), as
defined by consensus criteria, were positive for MYD88 L265P expression
by either conventional or quantitative AS-PCR assays. Treon et al.
(2012) concluded that IgM MGUS is heterogeneous and that MYD88 L265P is
probably a driver mutation toward Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.

604174	TITLE *604174 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L15; RPL15
DESCRIPTION The mammalian ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species (see 180450) and
approximately 80 different proteins (see 180466).

Adams et al. (1992) isolated an RPL15 cDNA as a human brain EST that
shows sequence similarity to the yeast ribosomal protein YL10 gene.

The complete coding sequence of the human RPL15 gene has been deposited
in GenBank (GENBANK L25899). The deduced RPL15 protein has 205 amino
acids.

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid mapping analyses, Kenmochi
et al. (1998) mapped the human RPL15 gene to 3p.

606855	TITLE *606855 RELAXIN 3; RLN3
;;H3;;
RXN3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching for sequences showing homology to relaxins (see
RLN1, 179370), Bathgate et al. (2002) identified RLN3, which they
designated H3, and assembled a complete coding sequence from multiple
genomic fragments. They also identified the mouse Rln3 gene by database
analysis through its homology with the human sequence. The human and
mouse genes encode deduced proteins of 142 and 141 amino acids,
respectively. Both proteins contain a putative prohormone sequence
incorporating the classic 2-chain, 3-cysteine-bonded structure of the
relaxin/insulin family, and the RXXXRXX(I/V) motif in the B chain
essential for relaxin receptor binding. Both have a predicted 27-amino
acid B chain, a 66-amino acid C-peptide, and a 24-amino acid A chain.
Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected weak signals in spleen,
thymus, peripheral blood leukocytes, lymph node, and testis. Northern
blot analysis of mouse tissues detected a 1.2-kb transcript only in
brain. RT-PCR revealed high expression of relaxin in mouse brain, ovary,
and testis, moderate expression in thymus, lung, and spleen, very low
expression in heart and liver, and no expression in kidney, skin, and
gut. In situ hybridization of mouse brain showed expression localized to
the pons/medulla, with highest levels in the pars ventromedialis of the
dorsal tegmental nucleus. Rln3 was also expressed at far lower levels in
the hippocampus and olfactory regions.

Using RT-PCR, Liu et al. (2003) detected RLN3 expression only in brain
and testis. In situ hybridization revealed limited Rln3 expression in
rat brain, with highest levels in periaqueductal gray, nucleus incertus,
and central gray regions in the brainstem.

GENE FUNCTION

Bathgate et al. (2002) found that synthetic RLN3 produced a
dose-dependent increase in cAMP production in a relaxin
receptor-expressing human monocytic cell line.

Liu et al. (2003) found that endogenous rat or porcine brain Rln3
stimulated GPCR135 (RLN3R1; 609445)-transfected Chinese hamster ovary
cell membranes to bind a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog. Using FLAG-tagged
human RLN3 secreted from transfected COS-7 cells, they confirmed that
RLN3 is a ligand for GPCR135. Radiolabeled RLN3 saturably bound GPCR135
in a monophasic manner with high affinity. Labeled RLN3 was displaced
from GPCR135 by unlabeled RLN3 or by the RLN3 beta chain, but not by any
other insulin/relaxin family members. RLN3 did not stimulate cAMP
accumulation, but it inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in
GPCR135-expressing cells in a dose-dependent manner. Liu et al. (2003)
concluded that RLN3 is a ligand for GPCR135.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bathgate et al. (2002) determined that the RLN3 gene contains 2 exons.

MAPPING

Bathgate et al. (2002) stated that the human RLN3 gene maps to
chromosome 19p13.3 and the mouse homolog to chromosome 8C2.

610885	TITLE *610885 ESSENTIAL MEIOTIC ENDONUCLEASE 1, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF, 1; EME1
;;EME1, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF, 1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

EME1 and MUS81 (606591) form an endonuclease complex that cleaves
branched DNA structures, especially those arising during stalled DNA
replication (Abraham et al., 2003).

CLONING

By searching for homologs of S. pombe Eme1, followed by PCR, Ciccia et
al. (2003) cloned EME1 and EME2 (610886). The deduced 583-amino acid
EME1 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 65 kD and shares 44%
identity with EME2.

Abraham et al. (2003) cloned mouse Eme1, which encodes a 570-amino acid
protein that shares 66% identity with human EME1. Northern blot analysis
detected expression of Eme1 in all embryonic and adult mouse tissues
examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Ciccia et al. (2003) showed that recombinant EME1 interacted with
recombinant MUS81. The heterodimer had DNA endonuclease activity against
3-prime flap and replication fork substrates, but the activity was much
lower against splayed arm or Holliday junction substrates. Neither EME1
nor MUS81 alone showed nuclease activity.

Abraham et al. (2003) found that the mouse Eme1/Mus81 heterodimer
preferentially cleaved 3-prime flap structures and replication forks
rather than Holliday junctions in vitro. Eme1 -/- mouse embryonic stem
cells exhibited no changes in viability, growth rate, or activation of
DNA damage-activated cell cycle checkpoints. However, loss of Eme1 led
to increased aneuploidy, increased sister chromatid exchange upon DNA
damage, and increased levels of spontaneous chromosomal abnormalities,
including breaks, fragments, chromosomal fusions, and dicentric
chromosomes. Compared with wildtype cells, Eme1 -/- cells showed a
2-fold increase in chromosomal abnormalities following treatment with
the DNA-crosslinking agent mitomycin C. Abraham et al. (2003) concluded
that EME1 plays a key role in DNA repair and maintenance of genome
integrity.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ciccia et al. (2003) mapped the EME1 gene
to chromosome 17q21.3. Abraham et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Eme1 gene
to chromosome 11C.
