606195	TITLE *606195 IROQUOIS HOMEOBOX PROTEIN 5; IRX5
;;IRXB2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IRX5 is a member of the Iroquois homeobox gene family. Members of this
family appear to play multiple roles during pattern formation of
vertebrate embryos.

CLONING

Members of the Iroquois complex in Drosophila, including the highly
homologous homeobox genes caupolican, araucan, and mirror, act as
prepattern molecules in neurogenesis. Bosse et al. (1997) identified 3
members of the Iroquois homeobox gene family in mouse and showed that
they are involved in several embryonic developmental processes including
anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral patterning of specific regions of
the central nervous system, and regionalization of the otic vesicle,
branchial epithelium, and limbs.

By EST database searching, Lewis et al. (1999) identified a human
breast-derived partial cDNA clone containing a novel homeobox. Using
oligonucleotide primers designed to this clone for RACE/PCR, they
obtained the full-length cDNA, which they designated IRX2 but which was
later designated IRX5, as well as fragments of transcripts derived from
4 additional IRX genes. The human IRX homeodomains are about 90%
identical to the homeodomains of the Drosophila Iroquois complex
proteins and about 93% identical to each other. Each of the IRX proteins
contains a hexapeptide-like motif. Lewis et al. (1999) found that the
deduced 417-amino acid IRX5 protein also contains acidic and polyproline
regions and an IRO box. Northern blot analysis detected 2 main
transcripts of 2.6 and 3.9 kb, but the larger transcript did not appear
to contain a closely related homeobox. IRX5 expression is not
breast-specific, as it was found to be weakly expressed in adult human
lung, uterus, salivary gland, and kidney. In situ hybridization
demonstrated that IRX5 is differentially expressed in major mammary
epithelial cell lineages and that its expression is further regulated
during both the proliferative and cyclical phases of human breast
development. IRX5 expression is maintained in human mammary neoplasias.

GENE FUNCTION

Through in vivo modeling in Xenopus laevis embryos, Bonnard et al.
(2012) demonstrated that Irx5 modulates the migration of progenitor cell
populations in branchial arches and gonads by repressing Sdf1 (CXCL12;
600835). They also found that transcriptional control by Irx5 is
modulated by direct protein-protein interaction with GATA3 (131320) and
TRPS1 (604386). Bonnard et al. (2012) suggested that IRX proteins
integrate combinatorial transcriptional inputs to regulate key signaling
molecules involved in the ontogeny of multiple organs during
embryogenesis and homeostasis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 5 affected individuals from 2 consanguineous families with an
autosomal recessive craniofacial syndrome mapping to chromosome
16q12.2-q21 (611174), Bonnard et al. (2012) screened 73 candidate genes
and identified 2 homozygous missense mutations in the IRX5 gene
(606195.0001 and 606195.0002) that segregated with disease in each
family. Irx5 knockdown by morpholino injection in X. laevis embryos
recapitulated the blood, heart, germ cell, and craniofacial anomalies
seen in patients with IRX5 mutations. In addition, Bonnard et al. (2012)
found that IRX5 has direct protein-protein interactions with GATA3 and
TRPS1, and noted that disruption of the latter proteins causes syndromes
with overlapping features (see hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural
deafness, and renal disease, 131320, and trichorhinophalangeal syndrome,
190350, respectively).

MAPPING

By screening of a human genomic library with chicken IRX2 cDNA and EST
database searching, Ogura et al. (2001) cloned 4 human IRX genes. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization, they mapped the IRX5 and IRX7
(606196) genes to chromosome 16q11.2-q13 and the IRX1 (606197) and IRX2
(606198) genes to chromosome 5p15.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Costantini et al. (2005) found that homozygous Ire5-knockout mice were
viable and fertile but had a defect in the differentiation of retinal
cone bipolar cells and were slightly smaller than wildtype.
Electrocardiograms revealed a significantly decreased signal amplitude
during ventricular repolarization. Lack of the cardiac repolarization
gradient was due to increased Kv4.2 (KCND2; 605410) in endocardial
myocardium, resulting in a selective increase of the transient outward
current, which is the major cardiac repolarization current, and in an
increased susceptibility to arrhythmias. Myocardial Irx5 was expressed
in a gradient opposite that of Kcnd2, and Irx5 repressed Kcnd2
expression by recruiting Bop (SMYD1; 606846), a cardiac transcriptional
repressor. Costantini et al. (2005) concluded that an IRX5 repressor
gradient negatively regulates potassium channel gene expression in the
heart and ensures coordinated cardiac repolarization.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HAMAMY SYNDROME
IRX5, ASN166LYS

In 3 sibs from a consanguineous Jordanian family, originally described
by Hamamy et al. (2007), with severe hypertelorism, midface prominence,
myopia, mental retardation, and bone fragility (611174), Bonnard et al.
(2012) identified homozygosity for a 498C-A transversion in the IRX5
gene, resulting in an asn166-to-lys (N166K) substitution at a
phylogenetically invariant residue in the third helix of the
homeodomain. Functional analysis demonstrated altered protein stability
and DNA binding activity, suggesting that the N166K mutation may act as
a hypomorphic rather than null allele.

.0002
HAMAMY SYNDROME
IRX5, ALA150PRO

In 2 brothers from a consanguineous Turkish family with severe
hypertelorism, midface prominence, myopia, mental retardation, and bone
fragility (611174), Bonnard et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a
448G-C transition in the IRX5 gene, resulting in an ala150-to-pro
(A150P) substitution at a phylogenetically invariant residue in the
second helix of the homeodomain. The mutation segregated with disease in
the family. X. laevis embryos with Irx5 knockdown showed defective
cranial neural crest cell migration that could be rescued with wildtype
mouse Irx5 DNA but not A150P Irx5 DNA. The A150P variant was also
unstable in X. laevis embryos compared to wildtype or N166K
(606195.0001); Bonnard et al. (2012) suggested that the A150P mutation
may act as a hypomorphic rather than null allele.

611331	TITLE *611331 SMALL NUCLEOLAR RNA, H/ACA BOX, 74B; SNORA74B
;;snoRNA, U19-2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs involved in RNA
processing. Box H/ACA snoRNAs, such as SNORA74B, direct the conversion
of uridine to pseudouridine at specific residues of ribosomal RNAs or
small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (Gu et al., 2005).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of human blood total RNA, Gu et al. (2005) identified several
box H/ACA snoRNAs, including SNORA74B, which they called U19-2. U19-2
contains 204 nucleotides and has 3 isoforms.

GENE FUNCTION

Based on sequence complementarity, Gu et al. (2005) predicted that U19-2
directs pseudouridylation of U3731 and U3733 of 28S ribosomal RNA (see
180450).

MAPPING

Gu et al. (2005) mapped the SNORA74B gene to chromosome 5, within intron
3 of the ATP6V0E1 gene (603931).

612696	TITLE *612696 VAULT RNA 1-2; VTRNA1-2
;;HVG2;;
VAULT RNA COMPONENT 2; VAULTRC2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Vaults are large cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteins composed largely of MVP
(605088) and a nontranslated vault RNA component. By PCR of a human
genomic DNA library, Kickhoefer et al. (1998) cloned 3 vault RNA genes,
HVG1 (VTRNA1-1; 612695), HVG2 (VTRNA1-2), and HVG3 (VTRNA1-3; 612697).
Both HVG2 and HVG3 contain 86 bases and have an internal RNA polymerase
III (see 606007)-type promoter element and a typical polymerase III
termination signal. They both have an internal 10-base deletion compared
with HVG1.

Kickhoefer et al. (1999) found that only HVG1 was expressed in all human
cell lines examined. When expressed, HVG2 and HVG3 were often associated
with the supernatant fraction rather than microsomal pellets containing
vaults.

Nandy et al. (2009) described the structure of VTRNA1-2. The
88-nucleotide RNA forms an extended stem-loop structure with asymmetric
internal bulges. It contains characteristic internal polymerase III
A-box and B-box promoter elements and a downstream B2-box motif. Size
exclusion chromatography of fractionated HeLa cells, followed by
Northern and Western blot analyses, detected about 5% of the VTRNA1-1
and VTRNA1-2 content eluting with MVP, while 95% remained in the
supernatant.

GENE FUNCTION

Kickhoefer et al. (1998) found that HVG1, but not HVG2 or HVG3,
associated with vaults in human cell lines.

Nandy et al. (2009) found that expression of VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2,
VTRNA1-3, and CBL3 (VTRNA2-1; 614938) was upregulated in cord blood
lymphocytes infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Upregulation was
highest for VTRNA1-1 (about 1,100-fold) and lowest for CBL3 (about
3-fold). Expression of VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2, and CBL3 was also upregulated
by the EBV-related Kaposi sarcoma virus, but not by members of other
virus families.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kickhoefer et al. (2003) determined that the upstream region of the
VTRNA1-2 gene contains a TATA-like element, a consensus proximal
sequence, and a cAMP response element.

MAPPING

Kickhoefer et al. (2003) stated that the VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2, and
VTRNA1-3 genes map to a 16-kb region of chromosome 5.

Nandy et al. (2009) stated that the VTRNA1-2 gene is located near the
PCDHA gene cluster (604966), which Wu and Maniatis (1999) mapped to
chromosome 5q31.

611191	TITLE *611191 MICRO RNA 125A; MIR125A
;;MIRN125A;;
miRNA125A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIRN125A, are small noncoding RNAs that
control translation of target mRNAs by binding to sites of antisense
complementarity in 3-prime UTRs (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2002).

CLONING

Lagos-Quintana et al. (2002) cloned mouse miRNA125a. Mouse miRNA125a and
miRNA125b (see 610105) differ only by a central diuridine insertion and
a U-to-C change in miRNA125a. Both miRNAs are similar to the C. elegans
lin-4 small temporal RNA. Northern blot analysis detected miRNA125a
expression in all mouse brain regions examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Laneve et al. (2007) found that MIRN9 (see 611186), MIRN125A, and
MIRN125B were upregulated in a human neuroblastoma cell line by retinoic
acid. They identified the mRNA encoding t-NTRK3, a truncated isoform of
NTRK3 (191316), as a target of the 3 miRNAs. The 3-prime UTR of the
t-NTRK3 transcript has a binding site for MIRN9 and another for both
MIRN125A and MIRN125B, which share the same seed sequence. These miRNAs
repressed t-NTRK3 expression in an additive manner, and downregulation
of t-NTRK3 was critical for regulating neuroblastoma cell growth.
Consistent with their function, MIRN9, MIRN125A, and MIRN125B were
downmodulated in primary neuroblastoma tumors.

MAPPING

Duan et al. (2007) stated that the MIR125A gene maps to chromosome
19q13.41.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By searching a human SNP database, Duan et al. (2007) identified a
G-to-U SNP at nucleotide +8 (+8G-U) in the mature MIR125A sequence.
Northern blot and quantitative RT-PCR analyses of transfected HEK293
cells detected the mature form of the major +8G allele of MIR125A, but
not the mature form of the minor +8U allele. The +8G-U SNP was predicted
to introduce a base-pairing mismatch, alter free energy values, and
create an enlarged RNA bulge in pri-MIR125A. In vivo analysis showed
that +8G-U blocked processing of pri-MIR125A to pre-MIR125A. Expression
of a vector containing MIR125A +8G, but not MIR125A +8U, could suppress
a MIR125A target reporter, LIN28 (611043). Duan et al. (2007) concluded
that the +8G-U SNP alters MIR125A processing and reduces
MIR125A-mediated translational suppression.

300822	TITLE *300822 OPSIN 1, LONG-WAVE-SENSITIVE; OPN1LW
;;RED CONE PIGMENT; RCP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The long-wave-sensitive opsin-1 gene (OPN1LW) encodes red cone pigment,
1 of 3 light-sensitive pigments that mediate human color vision. The
red-sensitive and green-sensitive (OPN1MW; 300821) opsins comprise a
family of repeated genes on the X chromosome. Whereas there is a single
red pigment gene, green pigment genes vary in number among persons with
normal color vision. The red pigment gene and the multiple green pigment
genes are arranged in a head-to-tail tandem array. The maximal
sensitivity of red cones is 560 nm (Nathans et al., 1986, 1986).

A master switch for the genes of this locus, called the locus control
region (LCR; 300824), is located between 3.1 kb and 3.7 kb 5-prime of
the gene array and has been shown to be essential for expression of both
the red and green pigment genes as well as cone-specific expression of
the genes and their segregated expression in separate cones (summary by
Deeb, 2005).

CLONING

Nathans et al. (1986) isolated and sequenced genomic and cDNA clones
that encode each of the 3 visual pigments. The deduced amino acid
sequences show 41% identity with rhodopsin (180380). The red and green
pigments show 96% mutual identity, but only 43% identity with the blue
pigment (613522). In determining which of the 3 opsin genes corresponded
to each of the 3 cone pigments, Nathans et al. (1986) used the fact that
2 are X-linked and 1 is autosomal. The autosomal one was clearly the
blue cone pigment which is defective in tritan colorblindness (190900);
which of the other genes was for the red pigment and which for the green
was resolved by study of males with red (protan) or green (deutan)
colorblindness.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nathans et al. (1986) determined that the OPN1LW gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

Nathans et al. (1986) mapped the OPN1LW and OPN1MW genes to the distal
part of Xq, tightly linked to each other and to the G6PD gene (305900).

GENE FUNCTION

Visual pigments consist of an apoprotein, opsin, covalently linked to a
small, conjugated chromophore, 11-cis retinal, or in some cases 11-cis
dehydroretinal. Photon absorption by the visual pigments initiates
visual excitation by causing an 11-cis to all-trans isomerization of the
chromophore. Variation in absorption spectra of different visual
pigments is thought to arise from differences in the primary structure
of the apoprotein. Specifically, the visual pigments of the 3 types of
cones that mediate color vision are thought to differ in their
absorption spectra as a result of attachment of 11-cis retinal to 3
structurally distinct cone opsins. A corollary of the hypothesis is that
colorblindness arises from alterations in the genes encoding the cone
opsins. Most humans can match any color by mixing 3 primary colors: red,
green, and blue. Thomas Young (1802) hypothesized that this phenomenon
(trichromacy) is the consequence of humans having 3 independent
light-sensitive mechanisms. It is now known that Young's 3 mechanisms
are embodied in 3 classes of cone photoreceptor cells in the retina.
Each class contains a different visual pigment, which determines the
spectral sensitivity of all the cones of that class. The maximal
sensitivity of red, green, and blue cones is 560 nm, 530 nm, and 420 nm,
respectively (Nathans et al., 1986, 1986; Deeb, 2005).

Light exposure can induce suppression and/or circadian phase shift of
plasma melatonin levels in subjects with normal color vision. To
determine if normal cone photoreceptor systems are necessary for
light-induced melatonin suppression, Ruberg et al. (1996) tested whether
color vision-deficient humans also have light-induced melatonin
suppression. In 1 study, 14 red-green color vision-deficient subjects
and 7 normal controls were exposed to a 90-min, 200-lux, white light
stimulus from 0200-0330 h. Melatonin suppression was observed in
controls (t = -7.04; P less than 0.001), all color vision-deficient
subjects (t = -4.76; P less than 0.001), protanopic observers (t =
-6.23; P less than 0.005), and deuteranopic observers (t = -3.48; P less
than 0.05), with no significant difference in the magnitude of
suppression between groups. These findings suggested that a normal
trichromatic visual system is not necessary for light-mediated
neuroendocrine regulation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Nathans et al. (1986) determined that whereas there is a single red
pigment gene, green pigment genes vary in number among persons with
normal color vision. The red pigment gene and the multiple green pigment
genes are arranged in a head-to-tail tandem array, with the red pigment
gene at the 5-prime end. Nathans et al. (1986) suggested that
nonhomologous pairing and unequal crossing-over can explain the
development of protan (red; 303800) and deutan (green; 303900)
colorblindness. Gene conversion may also be involved.

Although there are 15 amino acid differences between the MW (green) and
LW (red) opsins, the greater part of the spectral shift in sensitivity
is the result of substitutions at sites 180, 277, and 285, with 5 other
sites having smaller effects. Site 180 (see 300822.0002) is polymorphic
in both MW and LW opsin genes. The middlewave opsin is missing or
defective in deuteranopia and the longwave opsin in protanopia. Using
refined methods, Neitz and Neitz (1995) reexamined the numbers and
ratios of genes in the Xq28 cluster in men with normal color vision.
Results indicated that many men have more pigment genes on the X
chromosome than had previously been suggested and that many have more
than 1 longwave pigment gene.

In a study of 33 unrelated subjects with blue cone monochromacy
(303700), Nathans et al. (1993) found one subject with a single red
pigment gene carrying an arg247-to-ter mutation (300822.0001). In
another subject, they identified a cys203-to-arg mutation in both the
red pigment (300822.0003) and the green pigment (300821.0002) genes. In
addition, in 14 unrelated BCM probands, Nathans et al. (1993) identified
a single 5-prime red, 3-prime green hybrid gene carrying the C203R
mutation.

In a Danish family with BCM, Ladekjaer-Mikkelsen et al. (1996)
identified an isolated red pigment gene with deletion of exon 4
(300822.0005). The authors stated that this was the first intragenic
deletion reported among the red and green pigment genes and that it
represented a new mechanism underlying the development of BCM.

Ueyama et al. (2002) analyzed DNA in 217 Japanese males with congenital
red/green color vision deficiencies. The normal genotype of a single red
gene, followed by a green gene, was found in 23 subjects. Four of the 23
were from the 69 protan subject groups and 19 of the 23 were from the
148 deutan subject group. Three of the 23 subjects had missense
mutations: asn94-to-lys (300821.0003) in the single green gene of a
deutan subject; arg330-to-gln (300821.0004) in both green genes of
another deutan subject; and gly338-to-glu (300822.0004) in the single
red gene of a protan subject. Both normal and mutant opsins were
expressed in cultured COS-7 cells and visual pigments were regenerated
with 11-cis-retinal. The mutations resulted in no absorbance or a low
absorbance spectrum. Therefore, these 3 mutant opsins probably affected
the folding process, resulting in a loss of function as a visual
pigment.

In a British family segregating X-linked recessive BCM, Michaelides et
al. (2005) identified a single hybrid 5-prime-L/M-3-prime gene
containing the C203R substitution in exon 4 (see 300822.0003).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BLUE CONE MONOCHROMACY
OPN1LW, ARG247TER

In the male proband from a 4-generation BCM family with 3 affected
individuals, who had been previously studied by Reitner et al. (1991)
(patient 'MP'), Nathans et al. (1993) identified a single red pigment
gene carrying a C-T transition in exon 4, resulting in an arg247-to-ter
(R247X) substitution.

RED CONE POLYMORPHISM
OPN1LW, SER180ALA

Genetic variation of human senses within the normal range probably
exists but usually cannot be investigated in detail for lack of
appropriate methods. Subtle perceptual differences in red-green vision
can be studied, however, since both photo-pigment genotypes and
psychophysical phenotypes can be assessed by sophisticated techniques.
Color matches of males with normal color vision fall into 2 main groups
that appear to be transmitted by X-linked inheritance. This difference
in color matching is likely to reflect small variations in the
absorption maxima of visual pigments, suggesting the presence of 2
common variants of the red and/or green visual pigments that differ in
spectral positioning. Winderickx et al. (1992) reported a common single
amino acid polymorphism (62% ser, 38% ala) at residue 180 of the RCP
gene, explaining the finding of 2 major groups in the distribution of
color matching among males with normal color vision.

.0003
BLUE CONE MONOCHROMACY
OPN1LW AND OPN1MW, CYS203ARG

In the male proband from a 3-generation family with 8 individuals with
blue cone monochromacy (303700), Nathans et al. (1993) identified a
cys203-to-arg (C203R) mutation in both the RCP and the GCP (300821.0002)
genes. In addition, in 14 unrelated BCM probands, Nathans et al. (1993)
identified a single 5-prime red, 3-prime green hybrid gene carrying the
C203R mutation.

Reyniers et al. (1995) described a family with BCM due to the presence
of a C203R mutation in both RCP and GCP. The flanking sequences of the
C203R mutation in exon 4 of RCP were characteristic for GCP, indicating
that this mutation was transferred from GCP into RCP by gene conversion.

In a British family segregating X-linked recessive BCM, Michaelides et
al. (2005) identified a single hybrid 5-prime-L/M-3-prime gene, which
was the result of recombination within intron 4, with a C203R
substitution in exon 4.

.0004
COLORBLINDNESS, PROTAN
RCP, GLY338GLU

In a person with protan colorblindness (303900), Ueyama et al. (2002)
found a gly338-to-glu (GGG to GAG; G338E) mutation in the single red
pigment gene. The mutant opsin showed no absorbance.

.0005
BLUE CONE MONOCHROMACY
OPN1LW, EX2DEL

In the proband of a Danish family with blue cone monochromacy (303700),
Ladekjaer-Mikkelsen et al. (1996) identified a single red pigment gene
in which exon 4 had been deleted. The same deletion was found in a
maternal half-brother with BCM and their unaffected carrier mother,
whereas the deletion was not found in a brother with normal color
vision. The deletion was predicted to generate a premature stop codon,
resulting in a protein that lacks the final 3 of 7 transmembrane
alpha-helices, including the lysine at codon 312 where 11-cis retinal
covalently attaches to normal pigment.

120353	TITLE *120353 MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 1; MMP1
;;COLLAGENASE, FIBROBLAST; CLG; CLGN;;
COLLAGENASE, INTERSTITIAL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Matrix metalloproteinases are zinc-dependent proteases that degrade
extracellular matrix proteins. MMP1 is also known as collagenase (EC
3.4.23.7) (Nagase et al., 1992).

CLONING

Brinckerhoff et al. (1987) identified a cDNA clone of human collagenase.
The clone identified a single collagenase gene of about 17 kb from blots
of human genomic DNA. Restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequence data
indicated that the cDNA clone was full length and that it was identical
to that described for human skin fibroblast collagenase. Collagenase is
the only enzyme able to initiate breakdown of the interstitial
collagens, types I, II, and III. The fact that the collagens are the
most abundant proteins in the body means that collagenase plays a key
role in the remodeling that occurs constantly in both normal and
diseased conditions. The identity of human skin and synovial cell
collagenase and the ubiquity of this enzyme and of its substrates,
collagens I, II, and III, imply that the common mechanism controlling
collagenolysis throughout the body may be operative in both normal and
disease states.

MAPPING

Gerhard et al. (1987) confirmed the assignment of the collagenase gene
to chromosome 11 by the use of a DNA probe for Southern analysis of
somatic cell hybrids. Analysis of cell lines with rearrangements
involving chromosome 11 indicated that the gene is in the region
11q11-q23. Church et al. (1983) had used somatic cell hybrids between
mouse cells and human normal skin and corneal fibroblasts and recessive
dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB; 226600) skin fibroblasts to
assign the human structural gene for collagenase to chromosome 11.
Production of collagenase was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay.
It appeared that both the normal and the RDEB collagenase gene mapped to
chromosome 11. This was earlier taken to indicate that the abnormal
collagenase produced by RDEB cells represented a mutation of the
structural gene. Later work indicated that both the autosomal dominant
(131750) and autosomal recessive forms of dystrophic epidermolysis
bullosa are due to mutations in the type VII collagen gene (COL7A1;
120120). The excessive formation of collagenase must represent a
secondary phenomenon, not the primary defect. It should be noted that
fibroblasts from patients with the Werner syndrome (277700) also express
high constitutive levels of collagenase in vitro (Bauer et al., 1986).

Pendas et al. (1996) isolated a 1.5-Mb YAC clone mapping to 11q22.
Detailed analysis of this nonchimeric YAC clone ordered 7 MMP genes as
follows: cen--MMP8 (120355)--MMP10 (185260)--MMP1--MMP3 (185250)--MMP12
(601046)--MMP7 (178990)--MMP13 (600108)--tel.

GENE FUNCTION

Maymon et al. (2000) measured levels of MMP1 in amniotic fluid from 353
women, including those with intact membranes, in term or preterm labor
or not in labor, and those with term and premature rupture of the
membranes (610504), with or without microbial invasion of the amniotic
cavity. MMP1 was detectable in 81.3% (287 of 353) amniotic fluid
samples, and the concentration increased with increasing gestational
age. Analysis of the matrix metalloproteinase profile of amniotic fluid
in term and preterm rupture of membranes showed that patterns were
similar for every enzyme except MMP1 and MMP8 (120355), suggesting
different molecular pathophysiologic mechanisms for extracellular matrix
degradation of rupture of membranes in term and preterm gestations.
Maymon et al. (2000) concluded that MMP1 is implicated in the mechanisms
of membrane rupture.

Lahmann et al. (2001) found significantly more MMP1 mRNA in the buttock
skin of smokers than nonsmokers and suggested that smoking-induced MMP1
might be important in the skin-aging effects of tobacco smoking.

Saffarian et al. (2004) showed that activated collagenase (MMP1) moves
processively on the collagen fibril. The mechanism of movement is a
biased diffusion with the bias component dependent on the proteolysis of
its substrate, not ATP hydrolysis. Inactivation of the enzyme by a
single amino acid residue substitution in the active center eliminated
the bias without noticeable effect on rate of diffusion. Monte Carlo
simulations using a model similar to a 'burnt bridge' Brownian ratchet
accurately described the experimental result and previous observations
on kinetics of collagen digestion. Saffarian et al. (2004) concluded
that the biologic implications of MMP1 acting as a molecular ratchet
tethered to the cell surface suggested novel mechanisms for its role in
tissue remodeling and cell-matrix interaction.

Boire et al. (2005) found that expression of PAR1 (F2R; 187930) was both
required and sufficient to promote growth and invasion of breast
carcinoma cells in a xenograft mouse model. MMP1 acted as a protease
agonist of PAR1, cleaving the receptor at the proper site to generate
PAR1-dependent Ca(2+) signals and migration. MMP1 activity was derived
from fibroblasts and was absent from the breast cancer cells. These
results demonstrated that MMP1 in the stromal-tumor microenvironment can
alter the behavior of cancer cells through PAR1 to promote cell
migration and invasion.

By in vivo selection, transcriptomic analysis, functional verification,
and clinical validation, Minn et al. (2005) identified a set of genes
that marks and mediates breast cancer metastasis to the lungs. Some of
these genes serve dual functions, providing growth advantages both in
the primary tumor and in the lung microenvironment. Others contribute to
aggressive growth selectivity in the lung. Among the lung metastasis
signature genes identified, several, including MMP1 (p less than
0.000001), were functionally validated. Two that were not functionally
validated but that achieved the highest statistical significance (p less
than 0.000001) were FSCN1 (602689) and angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4;
605910). Those subjects expressing the lung metastasis signature had a
significantly poorer lung metastasis-free survival, but not bone
metastasis-free survival, compared to subjects without the signature.

Metastasis entails numerous biologic functions that collectively enable
cancerous cells from a primary site to disseminate and overtake distant
organs. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, Gupta et al. (2007)
showed that the epidermal growth factor receptor ligand epiregulin
(602061), the cyclooxygenase COX2 (600262), and the matrix
metalloproteinases MMP1 and MMP2 (120360), when expressed in human
breast cancer cells, collectively facilitate the assembly of new tumor
blood vessels, the release of tumor cells into the circulation, and the
breaching of lung capillaries by circulating tumor cells to seed
pulmonary metastasis. Gupta et al. (2007) concluded that their findings
revealed how aggressive primary tumorigenic functions can be
mechanistically coupled to greater lung metastatic potential, and how
such biologic activities can be therapeutically targeted with specific
drug combinations.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Joos et al. (2002) found an association between a 1-bp insertion in the
MMP1 gene (G-1607GG; dbSNP rs1799750; 120353.0001) and the rate of
decline of lung function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD;
606963).

Fujimoto et al. (2002) analyzed the G-1607GG promoter polymorphism in
the MMP1 gene in 75 African American infants who were born after preterm
premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM; 610504) and 235 controls, and
found a significant association between fetal carriage of a 2G allele
and PPROM (OR = 2.29; p = 0.028).

In studies in amnion fibroblasts, Wang et al. (2008) found that
inhibition of DNA methylation resulted in significantly increased MMP1
gene transcription and an associated significant increase in MMP1
production. These effects were correlated with reduced DNA methylation
at a specific site, -1538C, in the MMP1 promoter, and DNA methylation at
that site was reduced in a larger percentage of fetal membranes that
ruptured prematurely. The authors identified another SNP, 3447T-C
(numbering based on AF007878.1; dbSNP rs2075847), and observed that the
minor C allele was always methylated in vivo and that methylation
resulted in increased affinity for a nuclear protein in amnion
fibroblasts. Plasmid transfection studies and chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated reduced promoter activity of the
minor C allele. In a case-control study involving 284 African American
neonates from pregnancies complicated by PPROM and 361 African American
neonates from normal term pregnancies, Wang et al. (2008) found the
minor C allele to be protective against PPROM (OR = 0.7451; p = 0.0326),
consistent with its reduced promoter function. Neonates homozygous for
the major T allele had 3.51-higher risk for PPROM compared to CC
homozygotes (p = 0.007). Wang et al. (2008) concluded that, in addition
to genetic variation, DNA methylation plays a role in controlling MMP1
expression and risk of PPROM.

Titeux et al. (2008) demonstrated that the G-1607GG polymorphism in MMP1
results in transcriptional upregulation. They found a significant
association between this SNP and disease severity among patients with
autosomal recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB; 226600).

Rutter et al. (1998) identified a SNP (dbSNP rs1799750) in the promoter
region of the MMP1 gene (position -1607) where an additional guanine
nucleotide creates a binding site for members of the Ets family of
transcription factors. The 2G SNP displayed significantly higher
transcription in normal fibroblasts and in melanoma cells compared to
the 1G SNP. The occurrence of 2G homozygotes was 30% in 100 CEPH
controls; in tumor cell lines it was 62.5%. Rutter et al. (1998)
suggested that increased MMP1 expression contributes to stromal
degradation involved in tumor invasion.

Rate of Decline of Lung Function in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease

Joos et al. (2002) investigated the role of MMP polymorphisms (including
G-1607GG in MMP1 and N357S in MMP12) in the development of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (see 606963). The authors determined the
prevalence of these polymorphisms in 590 continuing smokers chosen from
the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Lung Health Study for
having the fastest (284 individuals) and slowest (306 individuals)
5-year rate of decline of lung function. Of 5 polymorphisms among 3 MMP
loci, only G-1607GG was associated with a rate of decline in lung
function. This allele was associated with a fast rate of decline (p =
0.02). However, haplotypes consisting of alleles from the G-1607GG and
N357S polymorphisms were associated with rate of decline of lung
function (p = 0.0007). Joos et al. (2002) concluded that polymorphisms
in the MMP1 and MMP12 genes, but not MMP9, are either causative factors
in smoking-related lung injury or are in linkage disequilibrium with
causative polymorphisms.

Preterm Premature Rupture of the Membranes

Fujimoto et al. (2002) studied the G-1607GG promoter polymorphism in
amnion-derived cells and found that the 2G promoter had more than 2-fold
greater activity than the 1G allele. Induction of MMP1 mRNA by phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was significantly greater in cells with a
1G/2G or 2G/2G genotype compared to cells homozygous for the 1G allele.
Analysis in 75 African American infants who were born after preterm
premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM; 610504) and 235 controls
demonstrated a significant association between fetal carriage of a 2G
allele and PPROM (OR = 2.29; p = 0.028). The authors concluded that the
2G allele has stronger promoter activity in amnion cells, that it
confers increased responsiveness of amnion cells to stimuli that induce
MMP1, and that this polymorphism contributes to the risk of PPROM.

Modifier of Epidermolysis Bullosa Dystrophica

Titeux et al. (2008) demonstrated that the G-1607GG polymorphism (dbSNP
rs1799750) in MMP1 results in transcriptional upregulation. The authors
found a significant association between this SNP and disease severity
among patients with autosomal recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa
(RDEB; 226600). In 3 affected sibs and a follow-up cohort of 31
unrelated French patients, the functional SNP resulting in increased
collagenase activity was associated with a more severe phenotype (p =
6.27 x 10(-5)). Titeux et al. (2008) concluded that increased MMP1 leads
to increased collagen degradation and worsening disease severity,
suggesting that MMP1 is a modifier gene in RDEB.

607287	TITLE *607287 LSM7 PROTEIN; LSM7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sm-like proteins were identified in a variety of organisms based on
sequence homology with the Sm protein family (see SNRPD2; 601061).
Sm-like proteins contain the Sm sequence motif, which consists of 2
regions separated by a linker of variable length that folds as a loop.
The Sm-like proteins are thought to form a stable heteromer present in
tri-snRNP particles, which are important for pre-mRNA splicing.

CLONING

In a search for human Sm-like proteins, Achsel et al. (1999)
fractionated proteins present in purified (U4/U6.U5) tri-snRNPs and
isolated 7 Sm-like proteins, which they named LSm2-LSm8. Using partial
peptide sequence for database searches, they identified and sequenced
EST clones. Using additional sequence obtained by PCR amplification of a
HeLa cDNA library, they assembled full-length cDNA sequences for
LSM2-LSM8.

Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999) searched database sequence for Sm proteins
and identified 16 potential Sm-related genes in yeast as well as some
Sm-related genes in human and archaebacteria. Using a multiple sequence
alignment of Sm domains, they built a phylogenetic tree of yeast, human,
and archaeal Sm and Sm-like proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Using electron-microscopy, Achsel et al. (1999) observed that purified
LSm proteins form a heteromer that is stable even in the absence of RNA
and exhibits a doughnut-shaped structure similar to the Sm core RNP
structure. They demonstrated that the purified LSm heteromer binds
specifically to the U6 snRNA at its 3-prime-terminal U-tract. They also
showed that the LSm proteins facilitate the formation of U4/U6 RNA
duplexes in vitro and concluded that the LSm proteins may play a role in
U4/U6 snRNP formation.

Using immunoprecipitation experiments, Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
concluded that there is a complex of 7 Sm-like proteins bound to RNA in
yeast. Lsm2-Lsm8 coprecipitate the U4, U5 and U6 snRNAs and directly
associate with the U6 snRNA present in the free U6 snRNP. Additionally,
the yeast Lsm2-Lsm7 proteins were found to be associated with the
pre-RNase P RNA but not the mature RNase RNA. Using immunoprecipitation
experiments from human cell extracts, Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
showed that the LSM3 and LSM4 proteins are specifically associated with
snRNP complexes containing the U6 snRNA. Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
concluded that Sm and Sm-like proteins assemble in at least 2
functionally conserved complexes of deep evolutionary origin.

By disrupting the Sm and Sm-like genes in yeast, Salgado-Garrido et al.
(1999) concluded that disruption of genes encoding Sm-like proteins
directly associated with the U6 snRNA (Lsm2-8) generated variable
phenotypes. Lsm2, Lsm3, Lsm4, and Lsm8 are essential for vegetative
growth. Lsm5, Lsm6, and Lsm7 are not essential for growth; however,
their disruptions lead to slow growth especially at elevated
temperature. The levels of the U6 snRNA were strongly reduced in the
strains harboring the Lsm5, Lsm6, and Lsm7 disruptions. Lsm1 and Lsm9
are dispensable for vegetative growth, but Lsm1 is required for optimal
vegetative growth at 30 degrees and is temperature sensitive.

Ingelfinger et al. (2002) determined that human LSM1 to LSM7, but not
LSM8, were expressed in HeLa cells within cytoplasmic foci. The foci
also contained a decapping enzyme (DCP1/2) and the exonuclease XRN1
(607994). Coexpression of wildtype and mutant LSM proteins, as well as
fluorescence resonance energy transfer, indicated that the LSM proteins
form a complex similar to one found in yeast. Ingelfinger et al. (2002)
concluded that the foci contain a partially or fully assembled machinery
for the degradation of mRNA.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the LSM7
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP stSG29317).

612092	TITLE *612092 MICRO RNA 200C; MIR200C
;;miRNA200C;;
MIRN200C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIRN200C, are 20- to 22-nucleotide noncoding
RNAs that inhibit gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by
binding to complementary sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of target mRNAs
(Park et al., 2008).

CLONING

Park et al. (2008) stated that miR200C belongs to the miR200 family of
miRNAs, which can be divided into 2 subfamilies based on a 1-nucleotide
difference in seed sequences. miR200A (612090) and miR141 (612093) have
a seed sequence of AACACUG, whereas miR200B (612091), miR200C, and
miR429 (612094) have a seed sequence of AAUACUG.

GENE FUNCTION

Park et al. (2008) evaluated expression of 207 miRNAs in 60 human cell
lines and found that expression of miR200 family members, including
miR200C, was associated with an epithelial phenotype. Expression of
these miRNAs showed a positive correlation with expression of E-cadherin
(CDH1; 192090), an epithelial cell marker, and a negative correlation
with expression of vimentin (VIM; 193060), a mesenchymal cell marker.
Park et al. (2008) identified multiple miR200 target sequences in the
3-prime UTRs of the E-cadherin transcriptional repressors ZEB1 (189909)
and ZEB2 (605802). Using the 3-prime UTRs of mouse and human ZEB1 and
ZEB2, they showed that endogenous miR200s suppressed ZEB1 and ZEB2
expression. Increasing the levels of miR200A and miR200C induced
mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in human cancer cell lines,
reducing their aggressiveness. Conversely, reducing miR200 levels
induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Park et al. (2008)
concluded that the miR200 family regulates EMT/MET by targeting ZEB1 and
ZEB2, which control expression of E-cadherin.

Using the MDCK canine epithelial cell line and a subclone with a
mesenchymal phenotype, Gregory et al. (2008) independently showed that
the miR200 family, including miR141, and miR205 (613147) regulated
expression of Zeb1 and Zeb2 and controlled EMT. Furthermore, expression
of the miR200 family and miR205 was lost in invasive human breast cancer
cell lines with mesenchymal phenotype and in primary breast cancer
specimens lacking E-cadherin.

Shimono et al. (2009) showed that MIR200C downregulated expression of
BMI1 (164831), a regulator of stem cell self-renewal. Expression of
MIR200C resulted in growth retardation and differentiation in Tera-2
cells, suppressed clonogenicity in mouse breast cancer cells, reduced
tumorigenicity of human breast cancer stem cells in immunocompromised
mice, and suppressed mammary outgrowth from normal mouse mammary stem
cells in vivo. Shimono et al. (2009) concluded that MIR200C provides a
molecular link between normal and cancerous stem cells.

MAPPING

Park et al. (2008) stated that the miR200 family members MIRN200C and
MIRN141 are clustered on chromosome 12, whereas MIRN200A, MIRN200B, and
MIRN429 are clustered on chromosome 1.

613117	TITLE *613117 SMALL NUCLEOLAR RNA, C/D BOX, 50A; SNORD50A
;;RNA, U50 SMALL NUCLEOLAR; RNU50;;
snoRNA, U50
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNORD50A belongs to the C/D box class of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs),
which are thought to function as guide RNAs in the site-specific ribose
methylation of preribosomal RNA (Kiss-Laszlo et al., 1996).

CLONING

Kiss-Laszlo et al. (1996) isolated SNORD50A, which they called RNU50,
from a cDNA library of intronic snoRNAs from HeLa cells. RNU50 is 74
nucleotides long.

GENE FUNCTION

Kiss-Laszlo et al. (1996) found that a 15-nucleotide sequence of RNU50
was complementary to a region near the D box of 28S ribosomal RNA (see
180450), and that a 12-nucleotide sequence of RNU50 was complementary to
a region near the D-prime box of 28S RNA. These regions of 28S RNA
contain an O-methylcytosine and a potential O-methylguanine,
respectively. Kiss-Laszlo et al. (1996) hypothesized that RNU50 may have
a role in methylation of 28S RNA at these sites.

Using Northern blot analysis and real-time PCR, Dong et al. (2008)
showed that expression of snoRNA U50 was downregulated in a significant
number of primary prostate cancer specimens and prostate cancer cell
lines. Ectopic expression of snoRNA U50 significantly reduced colony
formation in the 2 prostate cancer cell lines examined.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tanaka et al. (2000) determined that the
SNORD50A gene lies within intron 5 of the SNHG5 gene (613263) on
chromosome 6q15.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Dong et al. (2008) identified a homozygous 2-bp (TT) germline deletion
in the SNORD50A gene in 2 (2%) of 89 unrelated patients with prostate
cancer but not in 104 men without prostate cancer. A somatic homozygous
TT deletion was found 2 of 30 prostate cancer cell lines or xenografts,
and 9 of 89 localized prostate cancers (total, 11 (9%) of 119 cancers).
The homozygous deletion abolished U50 suppressive function in a colony
formation assay, suggesting that SNORD50A is a tumor suppressor gene and
that germline mutation may increase susceptibility to prostate cancer.
Further analysis of 1,371 prostate cancer patients and 1,371 matched
controls showed that a heterozygous germline TT deletion was found at
similar levels in patients and controls, suggesting that it may be a
common polymorphism.
