VAULT RNA COMPONENT 3; VAULTRC3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Vaults are large cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteins composed largely of MVP
(605088) and a nontranslated vault RNA component. By PCR of a human
genomic DNA library, Kickhoefer et al. (1998) cloned 3 vault RNA genes,
HVG1 (VTRNA1-1; 612695), HVG2 (VTRNA1-2; 612696), and HVG3 (VTRNA1-3).
Both HVG2 and HVG3 contain 86 bases and have an internal RNA polymerase
III (see 606007)-type promoter element and a typical polymerase III
termination signal. They both have an internal 10-base deletion compared
with HVG1.

Kickhoefer et al. (1999) found that only HVG1 was expressed in all human
cell lines examined. When expressed, HVG2 and HVG3 were often associated
with the supernatant fraction rather than microsomal pellets containing
vaults.

Nandy et al. (2009) described the structure of VTRNA1-3. The
89-nucleotide RNA forms an extended stem-loop structure with asymmetric
internal bulges. It contains characteristic internal polymerase III
A-box and B-box promoter elements and a downstream B2-box motif.

GENE FUNCTION

Kickhoefer et al. (1998) found that HVG1, but not HVG2 or HVG3,
associated with vaults in human cell lines.

Nandy et al. (2009) found that expression of VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2,
VTRNA1-3, and CBL3 (VTRNA2-1; 614938) was upregulated in cord blood
lymphocytes infected with Epstein-Barr virus. Upregulation was highest
for VTRNA1-1 (about 1,100-fold) and lowest for CBL3 (about 3-fold).

GENE STRUCTURE

Kickhoefer et al. (2003) determined that the upstream region of the
VTRNA1-3 gene contains a TATA-like element, a consensus proximal
sequence, and a cAMP response element.

MAPPING

Kickhoefer et al. (2003) stated that the VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2, and
VTRNA1-3 genes map to a 16-kb region of chromosome 5.

Nandy et al. (2009) stated that the VTRNA1-3 gene is located near the
PCDHA gene cluster (604966), which Wu and Maniatis (1999) mapped to
chromosome 5q31.

604744	TITLE *604744 DIMETHYLARGININE DIMETHYLAMINOHYDROLASE 2; DDAH2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH; EC 3.5.3.18) regulates
cellular methylarginine concentrations, which in turn inhibit nitric
oxide synthase (see 163731) activity.

CLONING

Leiper et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding DDAHI (604743) and, by
screening a database of translated open reading frames with the deduced
DDAHI peptide sequence, identified DDAHII. Both DDAHI and DDAHII cDNAs
encode 285-amino acid proteins. The DDAHII amino acid sequence shares
98% identity with that of its mouse homolog and 62% identity with the
sequence of DDAHI. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.0-kb DDAHII
transcript expressed at highest levels in heart, kidney, and placenta.

By RNA dot blot analysis, Tran et al. (2000) determined that DDAH2
expression predominates in more highly vascularized tissues and in
immune tissues, while DDAH1 expression predominates in tissues that also
express the neuronal isoform of NOS (163731).

GENE FUNCTION

Leiper et al. (1999) expressed a histidine-tagged DDAHII clone in E.
coli and assayed the cell lysate for DDAH activity. Recombinant DDAHII
metabolized ADMA and L-NMMA, but not SDMA or L-arginine, demonstrating
that DDAHII is a functional homolog of DDAHI.

By overexpression in human and murine endothelial cells, Smith et al.
(2003) determined that DDAH2 reduced the secretion of ADMA, increased
VEGF mRNA expression, and enhanced tube formation by cells grown in a
3-dimensional medium. A DDAH inhibitor reduced tube formation in human
umbilical vein endothelial cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Genomic sequence analysis by Tran et al. (2000) indicated that DDAH2
contains 8 exons with 3 transcription start sites that generate
alternatively spliced transcripts.

MAPPING

Tran et al. (2000) mapped the DDAH2 gene to 6p21.3 by radiation hybrid
and FISH analysis.

601613	TITLE *601613 CHEMOKINE, CXC MOTIF, RECEPTOR 5; CXCR5
;;BURKITT LYMPHOMA RECEPTOR 1; BLR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dobner et al. (1992) and Kaiser et al. (1993) identified a novel member
of the G protein-coupled receptor family termed BLR1 (BLR1 having been
identified from Burkitt lymphoma).

GENE FUNCTION

B lymphocytes recirculate between B cell-rich compartments (follicles or
B zones) in secondary lymphoid organs, surveying for antigen. After
antigen binding, B cells move to the boundary of B and T zones to
interact with T-helper cells. Reif et al. (2002) demonstrated that
antigen-engaged B cells have increased expression of CCR7 (600242), the
receptor for the T-zone chemokines CCL19 (602227) and CCL21 (602737),
and that they exhibit increased responsiveness to both chemoattractants.
In mice lacking lymphoid CCL19 and CCL21 chemokines, or with B cells
that lack CCR7, antigen engagement fails to cause movement to the T
zone. Using retroviral-mediated gene transfer, the authors demonstrated
that increased expression of CCR7 is sufficient to direct B cells to the
T zone. Reciprocally, overexpression of CXCR5, the receptor for the
B-zone chemokine CXCL13 (also known as BLC), is sufficient to overcome
antigen-induced B-cell movement to the T zone. Reif et al. (2002)
concluded that their findings defined the mechanism of B-cell
relocalization in response to antigen, and established that cell
position in vivo can be determined by the balance of responsiveness to
chemoattractants made in separate but adjacent zones.

Chan et al. (2003) investigated the expression of chemokines and
chemokine receptors in eyes with primary intraocular B-cell lymphoma
(PIOL). All 3 PIOL eyes showed similar pathology, with typical diffuse
large B-lymphoma cells between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and
Bruch membrane. The eyes also showed a similar chemokine profile with
the expression of CXCR4 (162643) and CXCR5 in the lymphoma cells. CXCL13
(BLC) and CXCL12 (600835) transcripts were found only in the RPE and not
in the malignant cells. No chemokine expression was detected on the RPE
cells of a normal control eye. Since chemokines and chemokine receptors
selective for B cells were identified in RPE and malignant B cells in
eyes with PIOL, inhibition of B-cell chemoattractants might be a future
strategy for the treatment of PIOL.

The germinal center (GC) is organized into dark and light zones. B cells
in the dark zone, called centroblasts, undergo rapid proliferation and
somatic hypermutation of their antibody variable genes. Centroblasts
then become smaller, nondividing centrocytes and undergo selection in
the light zone based on the affinity of their surface antibody for the
inducing antigen. The light zone also contains helper T cells and
follicular dendritic cells that sequester antigen. Failure to
differentiate results in centrocyte apoptosis, whereas centrocytes that
bind antigen and receive T-cell help emigrate from the GC as long-lived
plasma cells or memory B cells. Some centrocytes may also return to the
dark zone for further proliferation and mutation. Using genetic and
pharmacologic approaches, Allen et al. (2004) showed that CXCR4 was
essential for GC dark and light zone segregation. In the presence of the
antiapoptotic BCL2 (151430), B cells had robust chemotactic responses to
the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12, as well as to CXCL13, the ligand for CXCR5.
CXCL12 was more abundant in the dark zone, and CXCR4 was more abundant
on centroblasts than centrocytes. In contrast, CXCR5 helped direct cells
to the CXCL13-positive light zone, but was not essential for segregation
of the 2 zones. CXCL13 and CXCR5 were required for correct positioning
of the light zone. Allen et al. (2004) concluded that these chemokines
and their receptors are critical for movement of cells to different
parts of the GC and for creating the distinct histologic appearance of
the GC.

Using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, Cagigi et al. (2008)
found that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see
609423)-seropositive patients, particularly those with low CD4
(186940)-positive T-cell counts, had reduced expression of CXCR5 on B
cells, whereas expression of its ligand, CXCL13, was increased. CXCL13
was secreted upon B-cell activation. CXCL13-positive B cells were
present in lymph nodes of HIV-1-seropositive patients, but not in
control tissue. Cagigi et al. (2008) concluded that altered expression
of CXCR5 and CXCL13 may be involved in B-cell dysfunction during HIV-1
infection.

ANIMAL MODEL

Forster et al. (1996) described the phenotype of gene-targeted mice
lacking the putative chemokine receptor Blr1. In normal mice, this
receptor is expressed on mature B cells and a subpopulation of T helper
cells. Blr1-mutant mice lack inguinal lymph nodes and possess no or only
a few phenotypically abnormal Peyer patches. The migration of
lymphocytes into splenic follicles was severely impaired, resulting in
morphologically altered primary lymphoid follicles. Furthermore,
activated B cells failed to migrate from the T cell-rich zone into
B-cell follicles of the spleen, and despite high numbers of germinal
center founder cells, no functional germinal centers developed in this
organ. These results identified BLR1 as the first G protein-coupled
receptor involved in B cell migration and localization of these cells
within specific anatomic compartments.

CXCR5 was known to be required for B cell migration to splenic
follicles, but the requirements for homing to B-cell areas and lymph
nodes remained to be defined. Ansel et al. (2000) demonstrated that
lymph nodes contain 2 types of B cell-rich compartment: follicles
containing follicular dendritic cells, and areas lacking such cells.
Ansel et al. (2000) generated mice deficient in the B-lymphocyte
chemoattractant (BLC; 605149), for which CXCR5 is the receptor, by
targeted disruption. BLC-deficient mice were similar in appearance to
mice deficient in CXCR5. However, CXCR5-deficient mice have less severe
deficiency in Peyer patches. Using BLC-deficient mice, Ansel et al.
(2000) established that BLC and CXCR5 are needed for B-cell homing to
follicles in lymph nodes as well as in spleen. They also found that BLC
is required for the development of most lymph nodes and Peyer patches.
In addition to mediating chemoattraction, BLC induces B cells to
upregulate membrane lymphotoxin alpha-1-beta-2 (see 600978), a cytokine
that promotes follicular dendritic cell development and BLC expression,
establishing a positive feedback loop thought to be important in
follicle development and homeostasis. In germinal centers, the feedback
loop is overridden, with B cell lymphotoxin alpha-1-beta-2 expression
being induced by a mechanism independent of BLC.

Voigt et al. (2000) found that B cells and dendritic cells do
colocalize, albeit aberrantly, even in the absence of CXCR5. In mice
lacking Cxcr5, both cell types were found in a broad ring around the
sinuses of the marginal zones. Voigt et al. (2000) concluded that in
Cxcr5-deficient mice, the organization of splenic primary follicles is
severely impaired. However, within the T cell zone a microenvironment is
built up, which provides all requirements needed for the affinity
maturation to take place.

Prinz et al. (2003) found that in mice deficient in Cxcr5 the follicular
dendritic cells (FDCs) are juxtaposed to major splenic nerves and the
transfer of intraperitoneally-administered prions (see 176640) into the
spinal cord is accelerated. Neuroinvasion velocity correlated
exclusively with the relative locations of FDCs and nerves; transfer of
Cxcr5 -/- bone marrow to wildtype mice induced perineural FDCs and
enhanced neuroinvasion, whereas reciprocal transfer to Cxcr5 -/- mice
abolished them and restored normal efficiency of neuroinvasion.
Suppression of lymphotoxin signaling depleted FDCs, abolished splenic
infectivity, and suppressed acceleration of pathogenesis in Cxcr5 -/-
mice. Prinz et al. (2003) concluded that their data suggests that prion
neuroimmune transition occurs between FDCs and sympathetic nerves, and
relative positioning of FDCs and nerves controls the efficiency of
peripheral prion infection.
