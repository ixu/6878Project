601621	TITLE *601621 T-BOX 3; TBX3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the course of studying the 12q24.1 region where linkage studies
indicated that the Holt-Oram syndrome (142900) is located, Li et al.
(1997) and Basson et al. (1997) identified the genes TBX3 and TBX5
(601620). The latter gene was found to be the site of mutations
responsible for Holt-Oram syndrome.

The cloning of new TBX3 cDNAs allowed Bamshad et al. (1999) to complete
the characterization of the TBX3 gene and to identify alternatively
transcribed TBX3 transcripts, including 1 that interrupts the T-box. The
complete open reading frame of the TBX3 gene encodes a predicted
723-amino acid protein, of which 255 amino acids are encoded by newly
identified exons. Comparison of other T-box genes to TBX3 indicated
regions of substantial homology outside the DNA-binding domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Sowden et al. (2001) examined the role of Drosophila 'optomotor blind'
(omb)-related T-box genes in the development of human and mouse retina.
Murine Tbx2 (600747), Tbx3, and Tbx5 and human TBX2 cDNAs were isolated
from retina cDNA libraries by hybridization to the Drosophila omb gene.
Human and mouse TBX2, TBX3, and TBX5 were expressed asymmetrically
across the embryonic neural retina, with highest levels of mRNA within
dorsal and peripheral retina. The dorsoventral gradient of TBX2
expression disappeared before the ganglion cell layer (GCL) formed. Its
expression became restricted to the inner neuroblastic retina and later
to the GCL and inner nuclear layer (INL). The dorsal expression domains
of TBX5 and TBX3 were maintained during formation of the GCL. As the
retina matured, TBX3 expression was restricted to the INL, and TBX5 was
expressed within the GCL. The authors concluded that the expression
patterns of TBX2, TBX3, and TBX5 within the developing retina support
the idea that the encoded transcription factors play a role in providing
positional information important for topographic mapping in
differentiation of distinct cell types across the laminar axis of the
retina.

Hoogaars et al. (2007) found that the sinoatrial node of mouse heart was
formed by proliferation of Tbx3-positive precursor cells and not from
bordering atrial cells. Tbx3 deficiency resulted in expansion of atrial
gene expression into the sinoatrial node domain and partial loss of
sinoatrial node-specific gene expression. Ectopic expression of Tbx3 in
mice repressed the atrial phenotype and imposed the pacemaker phenotype
on the atria, resulting in development of functional ectopic pacemakers.

Niwa et al. (2009) showed that 2 LIF (159540) signaling pathways are
each connected to the core circuitry required to maintain pluripotency
via different transcription factors. In mouse embryonic stem cells, Klf4
(602253) is mainly activated by the Jak-Stat3 pathway and preferentially
activates Sox2 (184429), whereas Tbx3 is preferentially regulated by the
phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase-Akt and mitogen-activated protein
kinase pathways and predominantly stimulates Nanog (607937). In the
absence of Lif, artificial expression of Klf4 or Tbx3 was sufficient to
maintain pluripotency while maintaining the expression of Oct3/4
(164177). Notably, overexpression of Nanog supported Lif-independent
self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells in the absence of Klf4 and
Tbx3 activity. Therefore, Niwa et al. (2009) concluded that KLF4 and
TBX3 are involved in mediating LIF signaling to the core circuitry but
are not directly associated with the maintenance of pluripotency,
because embryonic stem cells keep pluripotency without their expression
in the particular context.

Using genetic lineage analysis, knockout studies, and explant assays,
Wiese et al. (2009) found that Tbx18 (604613) was required to establish
the large head structure of the mouse sinoatrial node from mesenchymal
precursors. Subsequently, Tbx3 induced expression of pacemaker genes for
pacemaker function.

Han et al. (2010) showed that the transcription factor Tbx3
significantly improves the quality of induced pluripotent stem (iPS)
cells. iPS cells generated with Klf4 and Tbx3 were superior in both germ
cell contribution to the gonads and germline transmission frequency.
However, global gene expression profiling could not distinguish between
the 2 groups of iPS cells. Genomewide chromatin immunoprecipitation
sequencing analysis of Tbx3-binding sites in embryonic stem cells
suggested that Tbx3 regulates pluripotency-associated and reprogramming
factors, in addition to sharing many common downstream regulatory
targets with Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and Smad1 (601595). Han et al. (2010)
concluded that their study underscored the intrinsic qualitative
differences between iPS cells generated by different methods, and
highlighted the need to rigorously characterize iPS cells beyond in
vitro studies.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yi et al. (2000) determined that the TBX3 gene contains at least 6 exons
and spans more than 9.0 kb.

MAPPING

The human TBX3 and TBX5 genes map to chromosome 12q24.1, and the murine
homologs, Tbx3 and Tbx5, map to chromosome 5 (Li et al., 1997; Basson et
al., 1997).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Li et al. (1997) pointed out that TBX3 may be a candidate gene for
Noonan syndrome (163950) and ulnar-mammary syndrome (UMS; 181450). The
latter possibility indeed proved to be the case; Bamshad et al. (1997)
demonstrated mutations in TBX3 in 2 families with ulnar-mammary
syndrome. Each mutation was predicted to cause haploinsufficiency of
TBX3, implying that critical levels of this transcription factor are
required for morphogenesis of several organs. Limb abnormalities of
ulnar-mammary syndrome involve posterior elements. Mutations in TBX5
cause anterior limb abnormalities in Holt-Oram syndrome. Because of
similarities in structure and function of TBX3 and TBX5 and because of
close linkage, Bamshad et al. (1997) proposed that these genes
originated from a common ancestral gene, each having acquired specific
complementary roles in patterning the mammalian upper limb.

Bamshad et al. (1999) identified novel mutations in the TBX3 gene in all
of 8 newly reported families with UMS, including 5 mutations downstream
of the region encoding the T-box. This suggested that a domain (or
domains) outside the T-box was highly conserved and important for the
function of TBX3. Bamshad et al. (1999) found no obvious phenotypic
differences between those who had missense mutations and those who had
deletions or frameshifts.

To determine how C-terminal mutations may affect transcription, Carlson
et al. (2001) created a series of fusion proteins to map regions that
conferred transcriptional activity, nuclear localization, and
DNA-binding properties of Tbx3. Tbx3 binds the canonic brachyury binding
site as a monomer and represses transcription. A key repression domain
(RD1) resides in the Tbx3 C terminus that can function as a portable
repression domain. Most UMS-associated C-terminal mutants lack the RD1
and exhibit decreased or loss of transcriptional repression activity. A
cluster of basic amino acids at residues 292-297 serves as a nuclear
localization signal. Two C-terminal truncation mutants exhibited
increased rates of protein decay. The RD1 repression domain of Tbx3 was
also shown to be capable of immortalizing primary embryo fibroblasts.

Borozdin et al. (2006) reported a Czech mother and 2 daughters who were
diagnosed with Holt-Oram syndrome, in whom they identified a 2.19 to
2.27-Mb contiguous deletion encompassing the TBX5 and TBX3 genes.
Clinical reexamination confirmed the presence of features of
ulnar-mammary syndrome that were previously unrecognized. Borozdin et
al. (2006) noted that the contiguous deletion also included the RBM19
gene, but commented that it was unlikely to contribute to or modify the
phenotype since all the anomalies present in the affected individuals
could be explained by either TBX5 or TBX3 haploinsufficiency.

Klopocki et al. (2006) sequenced the TBX3 gene in a 3.5-year-old girl
with an ulnar-mammary-like phenotype, dysmorphic facies, and mental
retardation, but did not detect any mutation. Microarray CGH revealed
heterozygosity for an interstitial 1.28-Mb deletion on chromosome
12q24.21, encompassing the TBX3 gene. The deletion and TBX3
haploinsufficiency were confirmed by FISH. Neither parent carried the
deletion. Klopocki et al. (2006) stated that this was the first
description of TBX3 haploinsufficiency caused by a genomic deletion in a
patient with ulnar-mammary syndrome and suggested that the facial
changes and mental retardation observed in this patient might be due to
involvement of neighboring genes.

In a boy and his mother with ulnar-mammary syndrome, Linden et al.
(2009) identified heterozygosity for a nonsense mutation in the TBX3
gene (601621.0005).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using the development of the 4-digit chick leg as a model system, Suzuki
et al. (2004) studied the role of Tbx2 and Tbx3 in specifying digit
identities along the anterior-posterior axis. Misexpression of Tbx2 and
Tbx3 induced posterior homeotic transformation of digit III to digit IV
and digit II to digit III, respectively. Conversely, misexpression of
constitutively active mutants induced anterior transformation. In both
cases, alterations in the expression of several markers, including Bmp2
(112261), Shh (600725), and HoxD genes (see 142987), were observed. In
addition, Tbx2 and Tbx3 rescued Noggin (602991)-mediated inhibition of
interdigital BMP signaling, which was pivotal in establishing digit
identities. Suzuki et al. (2004) concluded that, in the developing
chick, Tbx3 specifies digit III and the combination of Tbx2 and Tbx3
specifies digit IV, acting together with the interdigital BMP signaling
cascade.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ULNAR-MAMMARY SYNDROME
TBX3, 1-BP DEL, 227T

In a mother and son with ulnar-mammary syndrome (181450), Bamshad et al.
(1997) found that the TBX3 gene had deletion of nucleotide 227, a
thymidine, resulting in shift of the reading frame and a premature
termination codon after 11 novel amino acids. A hand x-ray in the mother
showed complete absence of the fourth digit (metacarpal and phalanges)
and fusion of the capitate and hamate bones on the right. The mutated
protein in this family was predicted to encode a markedly truncated
protein containing only 86 amino acids and lacking the entire T-box
domain. This mutant protein should be incapable of binding DNA. Affected
members of this family demonstrated limb and apocrine anomalies.

.0002
ULNAR-MAMMARY SYNDROME
TBX3, IVS2DS, G-C, +1

In a mother and daughter with ulnar-mammary syndrome (181450), Bamshad
et al. (1997) demonstrated heterozygosity for a G-to-C transversion in
the first nucleotide of intron 2. This substitution altered the
consensus splice donor site and was predicted to alter gene splicing.
This family exhibited limb, apocrine, and genital anomalies.

.0003
ULNAR-MAMMARY SYNDROME
TBX3, LYS273TER

In a Japanese mother and her 2 sons with ulnar-mammary syndrome
(181450), Sasaki et al. (2002) found a heterozygous 817A-T mutation in
exon 4 of the TBX3 gene, leading to a lys273-to-ter substitution. The
mutation is expected to impair the DNA-binding capacity of the TBX3
protein.

.0004
ULNAR-MAMMARY SYNDROME
TBX3, 1-BP INS, 88A

Wollnik et al. (2002) reported a large Turkish family in which 10
members spanning 3 generations had autosomal dominant ulnar-mammary
syndrome (181450). The phenotypic expression of the disease was highly
variable among the affected family members showing posterior (ulnar or
postaxial) limb deficiencies and/or duplications, mammary gland
hypoplasia, apocrine dysfunction, and dental and genital abnormalities.
Mutation analysis identified a 1-bp insertion (88insA) in the TBX3 gene.
The truncated protein lacked almost all functionally important parts of
TBX3 and probably had complete loss of function.

.0005
ULNAR-MAMMARY SYNDROME
TBX3, GLN331TER

In a boy and his mother with ulnar-mammary syndrome (UMS; 181450),
Linden et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a 991C-T transition
in exon 5 of the TBX3 gene, resulting in a gln331-to-ter (Q331X)
substitution. The boy had phenotypic features not theretofore described
in UMS, including hypoplastic anterior pituitary and ectopic posterior
pituitary gland, ventricular septal defect, and cardiac conduction
defects consistent with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (see 194200). In
addition, the boy's mother did not show the classic features of UMS,
supporting the variable expressivity of UMS within the same family.

613648	TITLE *613648 MATERNALLY EXPRESSED GENE 8; MEG8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for human orthologs of imprinted ovine genes, Charlier et
al. (2001) identified MEG8. They noted that MEG8 contains a high degree
of interspersed repeats and, while represented by several ESTs, appears
to lack a protein-coding sequence. RT-PCR of ovine tissues revealed
highest expression in skeletal muscle and kidney. Meg8 was maternally
expressed in sheep.

By searching for human orthologs of an imprinted small nucleolar RNA
(snoRNA) gene from rat chromosome 6 in a syntenic region of human
chromosome 14, Cavaille et al. (2002) identified SNORD112 (613649),
which they called 14q(0), within an intron of the MEG8 gene. Downstream
of MEG8, they identified 9 tandem copies of SNORD113 (see 613650)
followed by 31 tandem copies of SNORD114 (see 613651), which they called
the 14q(I) and 14q(II) clusters, respectively. Each of the 70- to
75-nucleotide snoRNAs contains the characteristic C/D-prime/C-prime/D
motifs and a terminal 5-prime-to-3-prime stem structure with a conserved
sequence. RT-PCR of several overlapping clones suggested that most of
the snoRNA genes originate from introns of a large RNA that includes
exons of the upstream MEG8 gene in addition to exons that overlap the
SNORD113 and SNORD114 gene clusters. This large transcript appears to be
devoid of significant protein-coding potential. Northern blot analysis
revealed highest SNORD112 expression in brain and uterus, with lower
expression in heart and weak expression in other tissues examined. This
expression pattern was identical to that of SNORD113 and SNORD114.

GENE STRUCTURE

Charlier et al. (2001) determined that the MEG8 gene contains at least 8
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Cavaille et al. (2002) mapped the MEG8
gene to chromosome 14q32.

610777	TITLE *610777 NEUROGUIDIN; NGDN
;;NGD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Neuroguidin is an EIF4E (133440)-binding protein that interacts with
CPEB (607342) and functions as a translational regulatory protein during
development of the vertebrate nervous system (Jung et al., 2006).

CLONING

Jung et al. (2006) cloned mouse Ngdn cDNA based on its homology with
Drosophila ngdn. The mouse and human protein sequences are 89%
identical. The 311-amino acid human NGDN protein has 3 conserved
N-terminal EIF4E-binding motifs. Northern blot analysis showed Ngdn
expression in mouse cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, kidney, spleen,
ovary, and testis. Western blot analysis detected Ngdn protein in all
mouse tissues except muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation and cap column assays in mouse cerebellum
extracts, Jung et al. (2006) determined that Ngdn physically interacts
with EIF4E. Using Ngdn EIF4E-binding motif deletion mutants, they showed
that all 3 motifs contribute to binding and can compensate for one
another. In Xenopus oocytes, Ngdn coimmunoprecipitated with CPEB, and
Ngdn inhibited translation of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element
(CPE)-containing mRNAs in oocytes. Whole-mount in situ hybridization of
developing Xenopus embryos detected ngdn mRNA in the animal pole
blastomeres of the 4-cell embryo and in the neural crest and neural
folds of the neurula-stage embryo. Injection of antisense
morpholino-oligonucleotides against ngdn resulted in disrupted neural
tube closure and neural crest migration.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the NGDN
gene to chromosome 14 (TMAP SHGC-62927).

104230	TITLE *104230 FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE 4; FUT4
;;ALPHA-3-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE; FCT3A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In human/mouse myeloid cell hybrids, Geurts van Kessel et al. (1984)
tested for reactivity with monoclonal antibodies with known myelocytic,
monocytic, or myelomonocytic specificity. Twenty antibodies, all of
which bound specifically to the surface of human myeloid cells,
exhibited similar reactivity patterns with the hybrid clones.
Chromosomal analysis showed that the gene or genes involved in
expression of the 1 or more antigens recognized by these antibodies must
be located on human chromosome 11q12-qter. This myeloid-associated
surface antigen was designated CD15 in the CD system.

Tetteroo et al. (1987) found that alpha-3-fucosyltransferase activity
correlated with the presence of human chromosome 11 in human-mouse
myeloid cell hybrids. Also, several other myeloid-associated
carbohydrate antigens, e.g., LeX (CD15), were associated with chromosome
11. Tetteroo et al. (1987) concluded that an alpha-3-fucosyltransferase
gene on chromosome 11 is responsible for synthesis of these antigens.

Couillin et al. (1991) identified an alpha-3-fucosyltransferase on
chromosome 11q, FUT4, that transferred fucose onto H type 2 more
efficiently than onto sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine, suggesting that it is
the myeloid type of alpha-3-fucosyltransferase that makes the
3-fucosyllactosamine epitope (CD15) on polymorphonuclear cells and
monocytes.

Of the fucosyltranstransferases examined by Cailleau-Thomas et al.
(2000), only FUT4 and FUT9 (606865) were expressed during human
embryogenesis; all of the others showed irregular or weak expression. By
Northern blot analysis of 40- to 70-day-old embryos, they found
increasing expression of 6-, 3-, and 2.3-kb FUT4 transcripts. Analysis
of fetal tissues revealed abundant expression in liver, muscle, kidney,
skin, and small intestine, and moderate expression in brain, lung, and
heart. The transcript size varied in different tissues. In adult
tissues, highest expression was found in lung and small intestine, low
expression in kidney, liver, and brain, and no expression in 12 other
tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Nakayama et al. (2001) showed that FUT9 directs CD15 synthesis in
lymphoid cells and mature granulocytes, whereas FUT4 directs CD15
synthesis in promyelocytes and monocytes. FUT9 exhibited stronger
activity for CD15 synthesis than FUT4.

MAPPING

Using human/mouse hybrid cell lines, Couillin et al. (1991) mapped a
human alpha-3-fucosyltransferase, FUT4, to chromosome 11q. Using panels
of somatic cell and radiation hybrids which retained different
rearrangements of chromosome 11, Reguigne et al. (1994) assigned the
FUT4 gene to chromosome 11q21, between D11S388 and D11S919. Using
fluorescence in situ hybridization and a cosmid containing FUT4
sequence, McCurley et al. (1995) confirmed the assignment of the FUT4
gene to chromosome 11q21.

Gersten et al. (1995) demonstrated that the mouse Fut4 gene maps to
chromosome 9 in a region showing syntenic homology with human 11q.
