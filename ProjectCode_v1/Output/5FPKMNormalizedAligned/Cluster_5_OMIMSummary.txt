603960	TITLE *603960 CALICIN; CCIN
DESCRIPTION In mammalian sperm, the dense cytoplasmic webs surrounding the nuclei
contain a complex structure called the perinuclear theca. In bovine
sperm heads, the perinuclear theca is subdivided into the anterior
subacrosomal layer and the posterior calyx, a funnel-shaped, dense, and
stable structure tightly surrounding the posterior part of the nucleus
on its inner side and apposed to the plasma membrane on the outer side.
Longo et al. (1987) determined that 2 kinds of basic proteins are the
major constituents of the thecal structure: calicin, a 60-kD protein
localized almost exclusively to the calyx, and a group of multiple-band
polypeptides (MBPs or cylicins; see 300768) that are found both in the
calyx and the subacrosomal layer. They speculated that during
spermiogenesis, these insoluble basic proteins contribute to the
formation of the perinuclear theca as an architectural element involved
in the shape changes and the intimate association of the nucleus with
the acrosome and the plasma membrane.

Von Bulow et al. (1995) purified calicin from bull sperm and determined
a partial protein sequence. By PCR analysis of testis cDNA with
oligonucleotide primers based on the calicin protein sequence, they
isolated bovine and human cDNAs encoding calicin. The predicted bovine
protein contains 588 amino acids and has a calculated pI of 8.1. The
partial human cDNA encodes a protein that starts at a position
corresponding to the fourth amino acid of bovine calicin. Overall, the 2
calicins are 91% identical. There are 3 consecutive repeats in the
middle of the calicin protein. Sequence comparisons revealed that
calicin shares homology with the Drosophila kelch protein, which is
associated with the actin-rich intercellular bridges (ring canals) in
the egg chamber that connect the oocyte and the nurse cells. Von Bulow
et al. (1995) noted that calicin is missing or is arranged in a
dramatically different pattern in the heads of malformed human
spermatozoa such as teratozoospermias with 'round-headed' sperm or with
other 'postacrosomal sheath defects.'

MICRO RNA 409-3p, INCLUDED; MIR409-3p, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNA molecules of about 22 nucleotides
that play important roles in gene regulation. The MIR409 precursor
stem-loop sequence encodes 2 mature miRNAs, MIR409-5p and MIR409-3p,
from its 5-prime and 3-prime ends, respectively (Altuvia et al., 2005).

CLONING

By database and sequence analysis, Altuvia et al. (2005) identified
MIR409-5p and MIR409-3p, which lie on the 5-prime and 3-prime ends,
respectively, of the MIR409 precursor stem-loop structure. They cloned
MIR409-5p from a pituitary gland cDNA library and MIR409-3p from a
neuroblastoma cDNA library.

GENE FUNCTION

By screening an miRNA library, Fort et al. (2010) identified MIR409-3p
among a small group of miRNAs that reduced production of fibrinogen (see
FGB; 134830) in HuH7 human hepatoma cells. Luciferase assays showed that
MIR409-3p specifically lowered FGB mRNA levels via a target site in the
FGB mRNA 3-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Altuvia et al. (2005) mapped the MIR409
gene within a miRNA cluster on chromosome 14 that includes MIR369
(611794).

Gross (2011) mapped the MIR409 gene to chromosome 14q32.31 based on an
alignment of the MIR409 stem-loop sequence
(UGGUACUCGGGGAGAGGUUACCCGAGCAACUUUGCAUCUGGACGACGAAUGUUGCUCGGUGAACCCCUUUUCGGUAUCA)
with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MIRN181C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIR181C, are short noncoding RNAs that
repress translation or induce cleavage of target mRNAs with which they
interact (Ciafre et al., 2005).

GENE FUNCTION

Using microarray analysis, Ciafre et al. (2005) found that expression of
MIR181C was significantly downregulated in primary glioblastomas and
human glioblastoma cell lines compared with normal brain tissue.

MAPPING

Ciafre et al. (2005) stated that the MIR181C gene maps to chromosome
19p13.3.
