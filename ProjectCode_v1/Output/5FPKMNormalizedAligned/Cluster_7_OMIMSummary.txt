TAX-RESPONSIVE ENHANCER ELEMENT B67; TAXREB67
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATF4 belongs to the large ATF/CREB family of transcription factors.
These proteins bind DNA via their basic region and dimerize via their
leucine zipper domain to form a variety of homo- and heterodimers to
regulate gene transcription (De Angelis et al., 2003).

CLONING

An activating transcription factor (ATF)-binding site is a promoter
element present in a wide variety of viral and cellular genes, including
E1A-inducible adenoviral genes and cAMP-inducible cellular genes. Hai et
al. (1989) identified cDNAs encoding 8 different human ATF
consensus-binding proteins, including a partial cDNA corresponding to
ATF4. They found that members of this family share significant sequence
similarity within a leucine zipper DNA-binding motif and an adjacent
basic region; the proteins show little similarity outside of these
regions.

The cAMP response element (CRE) is an octanucleotide motif that mediates
diverse transcriptional regulatory effects. By screening a Jurkat T-cell
line expression library for the ability to bind CRE, Karpinski et al.
(1992) isolated a full-length cDNA corresponding to ATF4, which they
called CREB2 (CRE-binding protein-2). The predicted protein contains 351
amino acids. Northern blot analysis revealed that the 1.5-kb CREB2 mRNA
was expressed in all human tumor cell lines and mouse organs tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Karpinski et al. (1992) found that, unlike CREB (123810), which
activates transcription from CRE-containing promoters, CREB2 functions
as a specific repressor of CRE-dependent transcription. The
transcriptional repressor activity resides within the C-terminal leucine
zipper and basic domain region of the CREB2 protein.

The p40tax gene product of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)
activates HTLV-1 viral transcription in trans through tax-responsive
enhancers in the long terminal repeats. Tsujimoto et al. (1991)
identified ATF4 as TAXREB67, a protein that binds to the tax-responsive
enhancer element in HTLV-1.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, He et al. (2001) found that mouse Nrf2
(NFE2L2; 600492) interacted with rat Atf4. Coimmunoprecipitation and
mammalian 2-hybrid analyses confirmed the interaction. An Nrf2-Atf4
dimer bound a stress response element (StRE) sequence from an Nrf2
target gene, Ho1 (HMOX1; 141250). CdCl2, an Ho1 inducer, increased
expression of Atf4 in mouse hepatoma cells prior to induction of Ho1. A
dominant-negative Atf4 mutant inhibited basal and CdCl2-induced
expression of an StRE-dependent construct in hepatoma cells, but it only
inhibited basal expression in a human mammary epithelial cell line. He
et al. (2001) concluded that ATF4 regulates HO1 expression in a
cell-specific manner, possibly in a complex with NRF2.

Siu et al. (2002) presented evidence that ATF4 binds nutrient-sensing
response element-1 (NSRE1) in the human asparagine synthetase (ASNS;
108370) gene and activates ASNS transcription in response to nutrient
stress.

Bagheri-Yarmand et al. (2003) found that expression of Atf4 was high in
virgin mouse mammary glands and in pregnant mammary glands, but it was
dramatically reduced during lactation and higher after weaning.
Transgenic mice overexpressing Atf4 in mammary epithelium showed
decreased proliferation and impaired differentiation of alveolar
epithelial cells during pregnancy and lactation. In addition, Atf4
overexpression induced apoptosis and accelerated involution of the
mammary gland, suggesting a role for ATF4 in the regulation of normal
mammary gland involution.

De Angelis et al. (2003) showed that human ATF4 and RBP3 (E2F1; 189971)
dimerized in vitro and in vivo and that RBP3 enhanced ATF4
transactivating activity. Expression of both proteins increased during
differentiation of a mouse myogenic cell line.

ATF4 has 2 upstream ORFs (uORFs) that are conserved in vertebrates. The
more 3-prime uORF, uORF2, extends into the coding region of full-length
ATF4. Independently, Lu et al. (2004) and Vattem and Wek (2004) found
that scanning ribosomes initiated translation at both uORFs of mouse
Atf4, and that ribosomes that translated uORF1 efficiently reinitiated
translation at downstream AUGs. In unstressed mouse fibroblasts, low
levels of phosphorylated Eif2 (see EIF2S1; 603907) favored early
capacitation of reinitiating ribosomes, directing them to the inhibitory
uORF2 downstream of uORF1, which precluded translation of Atf4 and
repressed the integrated stress response. In stressed cells, high levels
of phosphorylated Eif2 delayed capacitation of reinitiating ribosomes,
favoring reinitiation at the Atf4 coding sequence over uORF2, which
permitted Atf4 expression and activated the integrated stress response.

Using Rsk2 (300075) -/- mice, Yang et al. (2004) showed that RSK2 is
required for osteoblast differentiation and function. They identified
the transcription factor ATF4 as a critical substrate of RSK2 that is
required for the timely onset of osteoblast differentiation, for
terminal differentiation of osteoblasts, and for osteoblast-specific
gene expression. Additionally, RSK2 and ATF4 were found to
posttranscriptionally regulate the synthesis of type I collagen (see
120150), the main constituent of the bone matrix. Accordingly, Atf4
deficiency in mice resulted in delayed bone formation during embryonic
development and low bone mass throughout postnatal life. Yang et al.
(2004) concluded that ATF4 is a critical regulator of osteoblast
differentiation and function and that lack of ATF4 phosphorylation by
RSK2 may contribute to the skeletal phenotype of Coffin-Lowry syndrome
(303600).

Blais et al. (2004) determined that EIF2-alpha (EIF2S1), PERK (EIF2AK3;
604032), ATF4, and GADD34 (PPP1R15A; 611048) are involved in an
integrated adaptive response to hypoxic stress in HeLa cells.

Sayer et al. (2006) performed a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human fetal
brain expression library and identified ATF4 as a direct interaction
partner of CEP290 (NPHP6; 610142). The protein-interaction domains
mapped to the N-terminal third of CEP290, encoded by exons 2 through 21,
and the C-terminal two-thirds of ATF4. To confirm that CEP290 and ATF4
interact physiologically in vivo, Sayer et al. (2006) performed
coimmunoprecipitation experiments using bovine retina extracts.
Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that endogenous ATF4 can be
immunoprecipitated using an antibody to CEP290 but not using a control
IgG. Reverse coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that antibody to
ATF4 can also precipitate endogenous CEP290.

Lin et al. (2010) showed that although Skp2 (601436) inactivation on its
own does not induce cellular senescence, aberrant protooncogenic signals
as well as inactivation of tumor suppressor genes do trigger a potent,
tumor-suppressive senescence response in mice and cells devoid of Skp2.
Notably, Skp2 inactivation and oncogenic stress-driven senescence
neither elicit activation of the p19(Arf) (see 600160)-p53 (191170)
pathway nor DNA damage, but instead depend on Aft4, p27 (600778), and
p21 (116899). Lin et al. (2010) further demonstrated that genetic Skp2
inactivation evokes cellular senescence even in oncogenic conditions in
which the p19(Arf)-p53 response is impaired, whereas a Skp2-SCF complex
inhibitor can trigger cellular senescence in p53/Pten (601728)-deficient
cells and tumor regression in preclinical studies. Lin et al. (2010)
concluded that their findings provided proof-of-principle evidence that
pharmacologic inhibition of Skp2 may represent a general approach for
cancer prevention and therapy.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ATF4
gene to chromosome 22 (TMAP stSG29796).

ANIMAL MODEL

Tanaka et al. (1998) used gene targeting to generate mice lacking Atf4.
They found that Atf4-deficient mice exhibited severe microphthalmia. The
Atf4-deficient eyes revealed a normal gross lens structure up to
embryonic day 14.5, after which the lens degenerated due to apoptosis
without the formation of lens secondary fiber cells. Retinal development
was normal in the mutant mice. The lens-specific expression of Atf4 in
the mutant mice led not only to the recovery of lens secondary fibers
but also to the induction of hyperplasia of these fibers. Tanaka et al.
(1998) concluded that ATF4 is essential for the later stages of lens
fiber cell differentiation.

NOMENCLATURE

The ATF4 gene, which Karpinski et al. (1992) referred to as CREB2,
should not be confused with the ATF2 gene (123811), which was formerly
known as CREB2.
