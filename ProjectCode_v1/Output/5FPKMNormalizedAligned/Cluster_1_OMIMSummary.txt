DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PLPLA2 is a triglyceride lipase (EC 3.1.1.3) that localizes to lipid
droplets and catalyzes the initial step in triglyceride hydrolysis
(Zimmermann et al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching for genes expressed exclusively in mouse adipose tissue,
Villena et al. (2004) cloned Pnpla2, which they designated desnutrin.
The deduced 486-amino acid protein contains a highly conserved 180-amino
acid N-terminal patatin domain with a glycine-rich region, an active
serine hydrolase motif, and an aspartate active site motif. By database
analysis, Villena et al. (2004) identified human PNPLA2, which shows 88%
amino acid homology to mouse desnutrin. Northern blot analysis detected
a 2.0-kb transcript expressed at high levels in mouse brown and white
adipose tissue and at intermediate levels in heart and testis. Very low
expression was detected in all other mouse tissues examined. Expression
of desnutrin was lower in gonadal fat deposits of genetically obese mice
compared with wildtype mice. Desnutrin mRNA was found only in mature
adipocytes and not in proliferating or confluent mouse preadipocytes.
Expression was rapidly increased in cells induced to differentiate.

GENE FUNCTION

Villena et al. (2004) found that desnutrin mRNA levels were regulated by
the nutritional status of mice, being transiently induced during
fasting. In vitro desnutrin gene expression was upregulated by
dexamethasone in a dose-dependent manner, but not by cAMP, suggesting
that glucocorticoids could mediate the increased desnutrin mRNA levels
observed during fasting.

Zimmermann et al. (2004) reported that an enzyme besides
hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; 151750) that they called 'adipose
triglyceride lipase (ATGL)' catalyzes the initial step in triglyceride
hydrolysis in mammalian adipose tissue. ATGL contains a 'patatin domain'
common to plant acyl-hydrolases. ATGL is highly expressed in adipose
tissue of mice and humans. It exhibits high substrate specificity for
triacylglycerol and is associated with lipid droplets. Inhibition of
ATGL markedly decreased total adipose acyl-hydrolase activity. Thus,
Zimmermann et al. (2004) concluded that ATGL and hormone-sensitive
lipase coordinately catabolize stored triglycerides in adipose tissue of
mammals.

Jenkins et al. (2004) found that purified recombinant PNPLA3 (609567),
PNPLA2, and GS2 (PNPLA4; 300102) expressed in insect cells showed
abundant triacylglycerol lipase activity. The recombinant enzymes also
showed acylglycerol transacylase activity by transferring the acyl donor
mono-olein to mono-olein or diolein acceptors to form diolein and
triolein, respectively.

Using a cell culture model and various biochemical approaches, Wang et
al. (2011) investigated the mechanisms by which perilipin-1 (PLIN1;
170290), PLIN2 (103195), and PLIN5 (613248) control lipolysis by ATGL
and its colipase, CGI58 (ABHD5; 604780). PLIN5 exerted a negative
regulatory role in lipid droplet hydrolysis by binding and inhibiting
ATGL activity at the lipid droplet surface under basal conditions. Even
after protein kinase A (PKA; see 188830) activation, release of fatty
acid was only modestly increased. In contrast, recruitment of CGI58,
followed by interaction with ATGL, increased lipolysis. Neither PLIN1
nor PLIN2 directly interacted with ATGL. Wang et al. (2011) proposed
that PLIN5 plays a critical role in oxidative tissues (e.g., heart and
skeletal muscle) to protect mitochondria from a rapid increase of fatty
acid during lipolysis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fischer et al. (2007) reported that the PNPLA2 gene comprises 9 coding
exons.

MAPPING

The Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PNPLA2 gene to
chromosome 11 (TMAP A009K14). Villena et al. (2004) mapped the mouse
Pnpla2 gene to chromosome 7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 patients with a neutral lipids storage disorder (NLSD) associated
with mild myopathy but not ichthyosis (NLSDM; 610717), Fischer et al.
(2007) detected mutations in the PNPLA2 gene. One individual was a
compound heterozygote for a 1-bp deletion (808delC; 609059.0001) and a
missense mutation (P195L; 609059.0002). The second was homozygous for a
1-bp deletion (847delC; 609059.0003). The third was homozygous for a
nonsense mutation (Q289X; 609059.0004). Fischer et al. (2007) considered
the PNPLA2 gene as a good candidate for mutations causing this disorder
because PNPLA2 is activated by ABHD5 (604780), mutations in which cause
another NLSD, that with ichthyosis (NLSDI), also called Chanarin-Dorfman
syndrome (CDS; 275630). Fischer et al. (2007) noted that the 808delC,
847delC, and Q289X mutations severely alter and delete the C-terminal
region of the protein, which includes the putative lipid-binding site.
They suggested that loss of the C-terminal region could explain the low
activity of the lipid droplet-associated lipase and the defect in
triglyceride catabolism, while the intact N-terminal region containing
the catalytic site may retain lipase activity, explaining the normal in
vitro lipase activity in whole lysate of fibroblasts.

Reilich et al. (2011) identified biallelic mutations in the PNPLA2 gene
(see, e.g., 609059.0002; 609059.0009-609059.0010) in 6 patients,
including 2 sibs, with NLSDM. Mutations in 5 of the patients resulted in
a lack of protein expression. The patients had adult onset of muscle
weakness affecting primarily the shoulder girdle but sometimes affecting
the lower limbs and distal muscles of the fingers and feet. Some
patients developed cardiac involvement later in the disease course. All
had increased serum creatine kinase, most had increased serum
triglycerides, and all had Jordans bodies on peripheral blood smear,
consistent with multisystem lipid accumulation. Other, more variable
features included diabetes, hepatic steatosis, and sensorineural hearing
loss. Activation of hormone-sensitive lipase by beta-adrenergic agents
such as clenbuterol appeared to bypass the enzymatic block in
PNPLA2-deficient patient cells in vitro, suggesting a possible
therapeutic approach.

In 3 unrelated Han Chinese patients with adult-onset neutral lipid
storage disease with myopathy, Lin et al. (2012) identified 4 different
mutations in the PNPLA2 gene (609059.0005-609059.0008). All mutations
occurred in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state.

ANIMAL MODEL

Das et al. (2011) showed that inhibition of lipolysis through genetic
ablation of Atgl or hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; 151750) ameliorated
certain features of cancer-associated cachexia. In wildtype C57BL/6
mice, the injection of Lewis lung carcinoma or B16 melanoma cells causes
tumor growth, loss of white adipose tissue, and a marked reduction of
gastrocnemius muscle. In contrast, Atgl-deficient mice with tumors
resisted increased white adipose tissue lipolysis, myocyte apoptosis,
and proteasomal muscle degradation and maintained normal adipose and
gastrocnemius muscle mass. Hsl-deficient mice with tumors were also
protected, although to a lesser degree. Das et al. (2011) concluded that
functional lipolysis is essential in the pathogenesis of
cancer-associated cachexia.

Haemmerle et al. (2011) found that Atgl knockout in mice resulted in
cardiac insufficiency and premature death. Cardiac dysfunction was
associated with excessive lipid and glycogen accumulation, disrupted
substrate oxidation and respiration in predominantly subsarcolemmal
mitochondria, reduced expression of Ppar-alpha (PPARA; 170998) and
Ppar-delta (PPARD; 600409) target genes, including genes directly
involved in fatty acid and glucose metabolism, and reduced expression of
Pgc1-alpha (PPARGC1A; 604517) and Pgc1-beta (PPARGC1B; 608886).
Atgl-null mice also showed defective expression of Ppar-alpha and
Ppar-delta target genes in liver, but decreased expression of Pgc1-alpha
and Pgc1-beta was specific to cardiac muscle. Conditional Atgl deletion
in heart and skeletal muscle only resulted in a cardiac phenotype
identical to that in Atgl -/- mice. Reexpression of an Atgl transgene in
hearts of Atgl -/- mice entirely rescued the lethal cardiac phenotype,
increased expression of Ppar-alpha and Ppar-delta target genes and
Pgc1-alpha and Pgc1-beta, restored the metabolic profile, and increased
life span to a level indistinguishable from wildtype. Treatment of Atgl
-/- mice with Ppar-alpha agonists, but not Ppar-delta agonists,
completely reversed all pathologic effects of Atgl deletion. Haemmerle
et al. (2011) concluded that ATGL is required for cardiac mitochondrial
function and activation of lipids as signaling molecules.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DEL, 808C

In a female from the Netherlands with neutral lipid storage disease with
myopathy (NLSDM; 610717), Fischer et al. (2007) detected compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the PNPLA2 gene. A 1-bp deletion in exon
7 (808delC) led to frameshift and a premature stop codon at amino acid
position 319. The other allele carried a missense mutation
(609059.0002).

.0002
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, PRO195LEU

The patient of Fischer et al. (2007) from the Netherlands with neutral
lipid storage disease with myopathy (NLSDM; 610717) carried a 584C-T
transition in exon 5 of the PNPLA2 gene that led to a pro195-to-leu
substitution (P195L). This mutation is localized on the border of the
N-terminal patatin domain in a region that is conserved in 5 proteins of
the PNPLA family and in homologous genes conserved in bilateral animals.
The other allele of the patient carried a 1-bp deletion (609059.0001).

Reilich et al. (2011) reported a 45-year-old woman from Newfoundland
with NLSDM and a homozygous P195L mutation in the PNPLA2 gene. She had
onset of slowly progressive myopathy in her twenties, followed by severe
congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy by her late thirties. She
also developed diabetes mellitus. The proximal muscles were more
severely affected. Her father died of dilated cardiomyopathy at age 57.
The proband also carried a homozygous G483R substitution in the PNPLA2
gene, which was of uncertain significance.

.0003
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DEL, 847C

In a French patient with neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy
(NLSDM; 610717), Fischer et al. (2007) detected homozygosity for a 1-bp
deletion in exon 7 of the PNPLA2 gene, 847delC, leading to frameshift
and a premature stop codon at amino acid position 319. This patient
developed diabetes at age 12 and died from cardiovascular complications
at age 34.

.0004
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, GLN289TER

In an Algerian patient with neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy
(NLSDM; 610717), Fischer et al. (2007) found homozygosity for an 865C-T
transition in exon 7 of the PNPLA2 gene that substituted a stop codon
for the glutamine at codon 289 (Q289X).

.0005
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, IVS6DS, T-C, +2

In a 44-year-old Han Chinese man with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Lin et
al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
PNPLA2 gene: a T-to-C transition in intron 6, and a 749A-C transversion
resulting in a gln250-to-pro (Q250P; 609059.0006) substitution. RT-PCR
of patient skeletal muscle detected only the Q250P mutant mRNA,
indicating that absence of the transcript results from the splice site
mutation. The Q250P mutation was not found in 50 controls.

In a 48-year-old Han Chinese woman with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Lin
et al. (2012) identified a homozygous G-to-T transversion in intron 6 of
the PNPLA2 gene. No PNPLA2 transcript was detected by RT-PCR analysis of
mRNA from skeletal muscle.

.0008
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DEL, 467C

In a 39-year-old Han Chinese man with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Lin et
al. (2012) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (467delC) in the PNPLA2
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination
(Pro156LeufsTer100).

.0009
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DUP, 613C

In 2 Turkish sibs with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Reilich et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1-bp duplication (c.613dupC) in exon 5 of the
PNPLA2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The
mutant transcript was predicted to undergo nonsense-mediated mRNA decay,
resulting in a lack of protein. Muscle weakness primarily affected the
proximal upper limbs, although both patients also had some distal
involvement, including of the lower limbs in 1. Serum creatine kinase
and triglycerides were increased. Both patients had hepatic steatosis,
but neither had cardiac involvement. Jordans bodies were present in
peripheral blood.

NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DEL, 543C

In a British man with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Reilich et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (c.543delC) in exon 5 of the
PNPLA2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The
mutant transcript was predicted to undergo nonsense-mediated mRNA decay,
resulting in a lack of protein. At age 28 years, the patient developed
slowly progressive muscle weakness affecting the proximal upper and
lower limbs. At age 52 years, he had Gowers sign, distal muscle weakness
of the upper and lower extremities, and cardiac involvement. He also had
sensorineural hearing loss since childhood. Jordans bodies were present
in peripheral blood.

.0011
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 4-BP DUP, 475CTCC

In a 35-year-old Japanese woman with NLSDM (610717), Akiyama et al.
(2007) identified a homozygous 4-bp duplication (c.475_478dupCTCC) in
exon 4 of the PNPLA2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination in the patatin domain (Gln160ProfsTer19). The mutation was
not found in 100 control alleles or in 50 unrelated Japanese
individuals. She had delayed walking and slow running from childhood,
with severe upper and lower limb involvement as an adult. However, she
did not have cardiac involvement. Imaging showed fatty replacement of
multiple skeletal muscles, and skeletal muscle biopsy showed
accumulation of neutral lipid droplets.

613486	TITLE *613486 MICRO RNA 33B; MIR33B
;;miRNA33B;;
MIRN33B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNA genes whose final
product is an approximately 22-nucleotide functional RNA molecule. They
play important roles in the regulation of target genes by binding to
complementary regions of messenger transcripts to repress their
translation or regulate degradation (summary by Griffiths-Jones et al.,
2006).

Two genes encoding miR33 isoforms exist in humans: miR33B, which is
present in intron 17 of the SREBP1 (184756) gene on chromosome 17, and
miR33A (612156), which is located in intron 16 of the SREBP2 (600481)
gene on chromosome 22. In mice, however, there is only 1 miR33 gene,
which is conserved with human miR33A, located within intron 15 of the
mouse Srebp2 gene. The mature miR33A and miR33B miRNAs differ at only 2
nucleotides. One of the targets of both miR33A and miR33B is the
cholesterol transporter ABCA1 (600046) (Najafi-Shoushtari et al., 2010).

CLONING

During an investigation of gene regulation by sterol regulatory
element-binding proteins (SREBPs), Najafi-Shoushtari et al. (2010)
identified the miR33B gene within intron 17 of the SREBP1 gene.
Najafi-Shoushtari et al. (2010) gave the sequence of mature miR33B as
GUGCAUUGCUGUUGCAUUGC. Using quantitative RT-PCR, they found that miR33B
was expressed in all human tissues examined, with highest levels in
brain, ovary, liver, prostate, heart, and cervix. Najafi-Shoushtari et
al. (2010) noted that miR33B appeared to be coexpressed with its host
gene, SREBP1.

MAPPING

The MIR33B gene resides on chromosome 17p11.2, within intron 17 of the
SREBP1 gene (Najafi-Shoushtari et al., 2010).

GENE FUNCTION

The sterol regulatory element-binding proteins SREBP1 and SREBP2 are key
transcription regulators of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis
and uptake. Najafi-Shoushtari et al. (2010) demonstrated that miRNA33A
and miRNA33B, embedded within introns of the SREBP2 and SREBP1 genes,
respectively, target adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter
A1 (ABCA1), an important regulator of high density lipoprotein (HDL)
synthesis and reverse cholesterol transport, for posttranscriptional
repression. Antisense inhibition of miRNA33 in mouse and human cell
lines caused upregulation of ABCA1 expression and increased cholesterol
efflux, and injection of mice on a western-type diet with locked nucleic
acid-antisense oligonucleotides resulted in elevated plasma HDL.
Najafi-Shoushtari et al. (2010) concluded that miRNA33 acts in concert
with the SREBP host genes to control cholesterol homeostasis.

MiR33A and miR33B are intronic miRNAs whose encoding regions are
embedded in the sterol response element-binding protein genes SREBF2 and
SREBF1, respectively. These miRNAs repress expression of the cholesterol
transporter ABCA1, which is a key regulator of HDL biogenesis. Studies
in mice suggested that antagonizing miR33a may be an effective strategy
for raising plasma HDL levels and providing protection against
atherosclerosis; however, extrapolating these findings to humans is
complicated by the fact that mice lack miR33b, which is present only in
the SREBF1 gene of medium and large mammals. Rayner et al. (2011) showed
in African green monkeys that systemic delivery of an anti-miRNA
oligonucleotide that targets both miR33a and miR33b increased hepatic
expression of ABCA1 and induced a sustained increase in plasma HDL
levels over 12 weeks. Notably, miR33 antagonism in this nonhuman primate
model also increased the expression of miR33 target genes involved in
fatty acid oxidation (CROT, 606090; CPT1A, 600528; HADHB, 143450; and
PRKAA1, 602739) and reduced the expression of genes involved in fatty
acid synthesis (SREBF1; FASN, 600212; ACLY, 108728; and ACACA, 200350),
resulting in a marked suppression of the plasma levels of very low
density lipoprotein (VLDL)-associated triglycerides, a finding that had
not previously been observed in mice. Rayner et al. (2011) concluded
that their results established, in a model that is highly relevant to
humans, that pharmacologic inhibition of miR33a and miR33b is a
promising therapeutic strategy to raise plasma HDL and lower VLDL
triglyceride levels for the treatment of dyslipidemias that increase
cardiovascular disease risk.

EVOLUTION

Brown et al. (2010) noted that the miR33A/B genes exhibit a remarkable
degree of evolutionary conservation. The precursor for mature miR33A is
found within the same intron of SREBP2 from many animal species,
including large and small mammals, chickens, and frogs. There is even a
perfectly conserved mature form of miR33A in the single SREBP-like gene
of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The latter is most remarkable
because insects do not synthesize sterols; their single SREBP gene
controls fatty acid production. Moreover, the fruit fly genome does not
contain ABCA1. In contrast to the uniform conservation of miR33A in
SREBP2, there is a gap in the evolutionary conservation of miR33B in
SREBP1. The SREBP1 genes from large mammals encode miR33B, but there is
no trace of miR33b in the Srebp1 genes of small mammals (rats and mice)
or chickens.

180231	TITLE *180231 RETINOIC ACID-BINDING PROTEIN, CELLULAR, TYPE II; CRABP2
DESCRIPTION CRABP2 is highly expressed in human skin. Giguere et al. (1990) isolated
a cDNA encoding mouse Crabp-2 by a low stringency cloning strategy using
a probe from previously cloned CRABP1 cDNA (180230). MacGregor et al.
(1992) determined the genomic organization of the murine Crabp-2 gene
and performed a detailed analysis of its transcriptional unit. It was
shown to be approximately 4.6 kb long and divided into 4 exons in a
structure common to other members of the family of serum and cellular
retinoid-binding proteins. The chromosomal location of the Crabp-2 locus
was determined by interspecific backcross analysis using progeny derived
from matings of C57BL/6J and M. spretus. Mapping results indicated that
the gene is located on mouse chromosome 2 linked to muscle nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor alpha-chain (Acra) and catalase-1 (Cas-1).
MacGregor et al. (1992) suggested that the human homolog is located on
2q or 11p. Elder et al. (1992) localized the CRABP2 gene to 1q21 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Localization was confirmed by
hybridization of a CRABP2 cDNA clone against a human/mouse hybrid cell
line containing a t(1;6)(q21;q13) translocation chromosome.

Flagiello et al. (1997) mapped CRABP2 to 1q21.3 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.
