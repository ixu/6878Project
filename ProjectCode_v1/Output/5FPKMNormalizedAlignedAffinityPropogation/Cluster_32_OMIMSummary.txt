;;EI24, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF;;
p53-INDUCED GENE 8; PIG8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The EI24 gene is an immediate-early response gene that is directly
regulated by p53 (TP53; 191170), suppresses cell growth, and induces
cell death (Gu et al., 2000).

CLONING

DNA damage and/or hyperproliferative signals activate wildtype p53 tumor
suppressor protein (TP53; 191170), inducing cell cycle arrest or
apoptosis. Mutations that inactivate p53 occur in 50% of all tumors.
Polyak et al. (1997) used serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) to
evaluate cellular mRNA levels in a colorectal cancer cell line
transfected with p53. Of 7,202 transcripts identified, only 14 were
expressed at levels more than 10-fold higher in p53-expressing cells
than in control cells. Polyak et al. (1997) termed these genes
'p53-induced genes,' or PIGs, several of which, including PIG8, were
predicted to encode redox-controlling proteins. They noted that reactive
oxygen species (ROS) are potent inducers of apoptosis. Flow cytometric
analysis showed that p53 expression induces ROS production, which
increases as apoptosis progresses under some conditions. The authors
stated that PIG8 is the human homolog of murine ei24, an
etoposide-induced gene.

By analysis of a BAC clone, Gu et al. (2000) determined that the PIG8
sequence reported by Polyak et al. (1997) is incorrect and that the
corrected 358-amino acid PIG8 protein shares 98% amino acid identity
with ei24. Western blot analysis indicated that ei24 expression is
approximately 500-fold higher in dead cells than in healthy cells. Phase
contrast and fluorescence microscopy showed that cells expressing Ei24
but not those coexpressing the apoptosis suppressor BCL2L1 (600039)
displayed the typical morphologic features of apoptosis. These results
suggested that ei24 suppresses cell growth through the activation of an
apoptotic pathway.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a murine myeloid leukemia cell line expressing a
temperature-sensitive p53 gene, Gu et al. (2000) showed that ei24, the
murine homolog of PIG8, directly responds to p53 as an immediate-early
response gene and is not induced secondary to p53-mediated cell death.
Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis demonstrated that purified
wildtype p53 protein specifically binds to a p53 response element in the
ei24 protein.

MAPPING

By FISH, Gu et al. (2000) mapped the PIG8 gene to 11q23, a region
frequently altered in cancers. Gu et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Ei24
gene to the proximal region of chromosome 9.

120260	TITLE *120260 COLLAGEN, TYPE IX, ALPHA-2; COL9A2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The COL9A2 gene encodes the alpha-2 subunit of collagen type IX. Type IX
collagen, a heterotrimer of alpha-1 (COL9A1; 120210), alpha-2, and
alpha-3 (COL9A3; 120270) chains specific for this type of collagen, is a
cartilage-specific fibril-associated collagen (Perala et al., 1993).

CLONING

In the process of characterizing genomic clones for the mouse COL9A2
gene, Perala et al. (1993) also used 4 pairs of oligonucleotide primers
designed for amplification of murine exon sequences to construct cDNA
clones for the human gene spanning more than 90% of the coding region.
The amino acid and nucleotide sequence identities between human and
chick are 78 and 71%, respectively.

MAPPING

Perala et al. (1993) assigned the human COL9A2 gene to chromosome 1 by
study of a panel of DNAs from human/rodent somatic cell hybrids.

Warman et al. (1994) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to
regionalize the COL9A2 gene to 1p33-p32.3. A single-strand conformation
polymorphism within the murine gene was used to map Col9a2 to mouse
chromosome 4. Since one form of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (EDM2;
600204) maps to the same region of chromosome 1, COL9A2 was considered
to be a candidate gene for that disorder.

Hellsten et al. (1995) demonstrated that the COL9A2 gene is in a 1-Mb
contig, proximal to RLF (180610) and MYCL1 (164850).

GENE FUNCTION

The cartilage collagen fibrils are formed from fibrillar collagens II
and XI (120280), while collagen IX is located on the fibril surface (see
Figure 2 in Muragaki et al., 1996). The alpha-1(IX) chain contains a
large N-terminal globular domain (NC4); a chondroitin sulfate chain is
attached to the alpha-2(IX) chain (Muragaki et al., 1996).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia 2

The usefulness of the candidate gene approach for identification of a
basic gene defect was illustrated by the finding of a mutation in the
COL9A2 gene (120260.0001) in a Dutch kindred with multiple epiphyseal
dysplasia 2 (EDM2; 600204) showing linkage to DNA markers in the region
of 1p32 (Muragaki et al., 1996). Muragaki et al. (1996) stated that the
results provided by the EDM2 'experiment of nature' represent the first
in vivo evidence for the role of collagen IX in human articular
cartilage.

Holden et al. (1999) described 2 families with distinctive
oligoepiphyseal forms of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, in which
heterozygosity for different mutations in the COL9A2 gene (120260.0002
and 120260.0003) was found. Both of these mutations resulted in the
skipping of exon 3 from the COL9A2 mRNA, but the position of the
mutation in the splice donor site determined the stability of the mRNA
produced from the mutant allele.

- Intervertebral Disc Disease

In Finnish individuals with sciatica and radiologically documented
intervertebral disc disease (IDD; 603932), Annunen et al. (1999)
identified a mutation in the COL9A2 gene (120260.0004).

- Stickler Syndrome V

In a large 5-generation consanguineous pedigree of Asian Indian origin
segregating autosomal recessive Stickler syndrome (STL5; 614284), Baker
et al. (2011) analyzed 3 candidate collagen IX-related genes and
identified homozygosity for an 8-bp deletion in the COL9A2 gene
(120260.0006) that segregated with disease in the family.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
EPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, MULTIPLE, 2
COL9A2, IVS3DS, T-C, +2

Muragaki et al. (1996) demonstrated a mutation in affected members of a
family with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (600204) that showed linkage
to the 1p32 region. Affected members were heterozygous for a splice site
mutation causing exon skipping during RNA splicing and an in-frame loss
of 12 amino acids within the alpha-2 (IX) collagen chain. The results
provided the first in vivo evidence for the role of collagen IX in human
articular cartilage. The clinical findings in the family were entirely
characteristic of MED although hip complaints were less conspicuous than
in many kindreds. The specific mutation was a T-to-C transition in the
consensus donor splice site of intron 3, resulting in the skipping of
exon 3.

Jackson et al. (2010) reported a large 4-generation family with
autosomal dominant transmission of EDM2 associated with the T-to-C
transition in intron 3 (186+2T-C) of the COL9A2 gene. The family had
previously been reported by Versteylen et al. (1988). The proband was a
33-year-old woman with short stature who complained of stiff and painful
hands and knees since age 4 years. Radiographs of the knees showed
Blount disease (progressive varus deformity of the proximal tibia
associated with internal torsion of the tibia) and of the spine showed
mild spondyloarthrotic abnormalities in the thoracic region. Her sister
had painful and swollen knees since age 4 years and developed severe
osteochondritis dissecans as an adult. Two sons of the proband were also
affected, showing pain in the knees during walking and clumsy walking.
These boys also had frontal bossing, depressed nasal bridge, and were
easily fatigued with mild muscle weakness. Radiographs of 1 son at age 3
years showed delayed ossification of the epiphyses, small proximal
femoral epiphyses, and small femoral and tibial epiphyses around the
knees. Skeletal muscle biopsy and mitochondrial studies showed no
significant abnormalities, only mild variations in fiber size and
slightly diminished ATP production. Jackson et al. (2010) commented on
the mild myopathy present in the boys, and noted that EDM is
characterized by clinical variability even within the same family. The
mild myopathic and mitochondrial changes observed may be secondary to a
tendonopathy and/or cell stress response resulting from expression of
mutant collagen.

.0002
EPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, MULTIPLE, 2
COL9A2, IVS3DS, 186G-A

In family K of Holden et al. (1999) with EDM2 (600204) the proband was a
17-year-old male of normal height who was diagnosed in childhood with
pain in the joints, mostly the knees, and genu varum. Radiographs showed
major epiphyseal changes in the knees and hands, and almost no changes
in the hips. The spine also appeared normal. The molecular change was a
G-to-A transition in the last nucleotide of exon 3, changing the last
codon of exon 3 from CCG (pro) to CCA (also pro). Although there was no
change in the amino acid, the change interfered with splicing.

Nakashima et al. (2005) identified the exon 3 G-to-A transition in the
COL9A2 gene in affected members of a Japanese family with EDM2. The
proband had bilateral double-layered patellae, indicating that this
unusual feature is not unique to autosomal recessive multiple epiphyseal
dysplasia with homozygous mutations in the DTDST gene (606718; see EDM4
226900).

Jackson et al. (2010) reported a patient with EDM2 characterized by
onset at age 3 years of an abnormal gait associated with proximal muscle
weakness. He had left-sided developmental dysplasia of the hip. The
family history was positive for hypodontia and for osteochondritis
dissecans. However, 2 affected adult family members showed improvement
of the disorder after puberty. The proband was heterozygous for the
186G-A transition in the splice donor sequence of exon 3 of the COL9A2
gene.

.0003
EPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, MULTIPLE, 2
COL9A2, IVS3DS, G-C, +5

Family G reported by Holden et al. (1999) with an oligoepiphyseal form
of MED (600204) and a mutation in the COL9A2 gene had affected members
in 4 generations, of whom a mother and her 2 sons were available for
study. They were slightly short in stature (adult height, 158 cm), and
all 3 developed genu valgum, which required surgical correction. The
mother started walking late and with a stiff gait that became more
noticeable during ages 5 to 7 years. Her legs became increasingly bowed,
and at age 17 she underwent tibial osteotomy. She had developed
increasing problems with pain in her hands, lumbar spine, and ankles.
Her 2 sons walked at age 2 years with a stiff gait. Epiphyseal dysplasia
was recognized in them in early childhood, and they underwent tibial
osteotomy for genu valgum at ages 14 and 13, respectively. They
continued to have mild joint symptoms, including intermittent lumbar
back pain and knee pain with swelling. Changes were not found clinically
or radiographically in the hips. Affected members showed heterozygosity
for a G-to-C transversion at position +5 of intron 3.

.0004
INTERVERTEBRAL DISC DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
COL9A2, GLN326TRP

In a study that examined for allelic variation in the COL9A2 gene in
Finnish individuals with sciatica and radiologically documented
intervertebral disc disease (IDD; 603932), Annunen et al. (1999) found a
substitution of tryptophan for glutamine at codon 326. This change was
found in 6 of 157 individuals with disc disease but in none of 174
controls. Further analysis of the families of 4 of the original patients
revealed that all individuals heterozygous for the trp substitution
demonstrated the disease phenotype. Many individuals within these
families had IDD but not the trp allele. The authors invoked a high
phenocopy rate to reconcile this observation with the conclusion that
this sequence variant within COL9A2 contributes to the pathogenesis of
disease. In the disease model chosen, this locus accounted for 10% of
disease prevalence. Under these constraints, Annunen et al. (1999)
demonstrated a lod score of 4.5 at a recombination fraction of 0.12.
Subsequent linkage disequilibrium analysis conditional on linkage gave
an additional lod score of 7.1. The authors did not exclude the
possibility that a true disease locus may lie in close physical
proximity to COL9A2.

.0005
EPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, MULTIPLE, 2
COL9A2, IVS3DS, G-C, -1

In 12 affected members from a 4-generation family with a relatively
hip-sparing EDM2 phenotype (600204), Fiedler et al. (2002) identified a
G-to-C mutation in the last nucleotide of exon 3 of the COL9A2 gene. The
disorder was characterized by childhood onset of pain and stiffness in
the knees. Finger joints, ankles, and elbows became symptomatic during
early adult life. Some adult patients had free articular bodies which
resulted in locking of the joints. Fiedler et al. (2002) noted that a
G-to-A change at the same nucleotide had earlier been found to cause
EDM2 (120260.0002).

.0006
STICKLER SYNDROME V
COL9A2, 8-BP DEL, NT843

In an affected sister and brother from a large 5-generation
consanguineous pedigree of Asian Indian origin segregating autosomal
recessive Stickler syndrome (STL5; 614284), Baker et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for an 8-bp deletion in the COL9A2 gene
involving the last 4 nucleotides of exon 16 and the first 4 nucleotides
of IVS16 (843_846+4del8). The deletion was predicted to cause a
frameshift and downstream premature termination codon (asp281glnfsX70).
The mutation was detected in heterozygosity in the sibs' unaffected
brother and parents.

601541	TITLE *601541 BROMODOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 3; BRD3
;;RING3-LIKE GENE; RING3L;;
OPEN READING FRAME X; ORFX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nomura et al. (1994) identified ORFX as a non-linked copy of RING3
(BRD2; 601540), a gene in the human major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class II region on 6p21.3.

MAPPING

Using a PCR probe derived from the ORFX cDNA sequence, Thorpe et al.
(1996) mapped the gene, symbolized here RING3L, by fluorescence in situ
hybridization analysis to 9q34. Several other MHC-related genes have
been found to map to the same region.

GENE FUNCTION

Dawson et al. (2011) demonstrated that I-BET151, a novel small molecule
inhibitor of the BET family, of which BRD3 is a member, has profound
efficacy against human and murine MLL-fusion leukemia cell lines through
the induction of early cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. I-BET151
treatment in 2 human leukemia cell lines with different MLL fusions
altered the expression of a common set of genes whose function may
account for these phenotypic changes. The mode of action of I-BET151 is,
at least in part, due to the inhibition of transcription at key genes
BCL2 (151430), C-MYC (190080), and CDK6 (603368) through the
displacement of BRD3/4, PAFc, and SEC components from chromatin. In vivo
studies indicated that I-BET151 has significant therapeutic value,
providing survival benefit in 2 distinct mouse models of murine

603732	TITLE *603732 CRYPTOCHROME 2; CRY2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hsu et al. (1996) identified a human gene, CRY2, whose product had 73%
amino acid identity to the human (6-4)photolyase (CRY1; 601933). The
CRY2 protein shares 51% amino acid sequence identity to Drosophila
(6-4)photolyase. Hsu et al. (1996) purified the human CRY1 and CRY2
proteins and characterized them as maltose-binding fusion proteins that
contain FAD and a pterin cofactor. Both CRY1 and CRY2 proteins lacked
photolyase activity. Hsu et al. (1996) concluded that these proteins are
not photolyases, but may function as blue-light photoreceptors in
humans.

As part of a search for human brain cDNA clones with the potential to
encode large proteins in vitro, Ishikawa et al. (1998) independently
identified CRY2. The CRY2 open reading frame encodes a protein of 589
amino acids with an apparent molecular mass of 67 kD.

Kobayashi et al. (1998) isolated and characterized mouse Cry1 and Cry2.
While Cry1 is localized to the mitochondria, Cry2 is found mainly in the
nucleus. The C termini of both mouse Cry2 and human CRY2 each contain a
nuclear localization signal, and the N terminus of mouse Cry1 contains a
mitochondrial transport signal. Cry1 protein bound tightly to DNA
Sepharose, while Cry2 protein did not.

GENE FUNCTION

Griffin et al. (1999) showed that human CRY1 and CRY2 act as
light-independent inhibitors of a heterodimeric activator consisting of
CLOCK (601851) and BMAL1 (602550), the activator driving Per1 (602260)
transcription, very likely by means of direct contacts between CRY1 and
BMAL1 and between CRY2 and CLOCK. They concluded that CRY1 and CRY2
occupy a central position within the mammalian circadian clock,
virtually at the interface between CLOCK-BMAL1 and PER1, PER2 (603426),
and TIM (603887). Griffin et al. (1999) suggested that Drosophila CRY
exemplifies the ancestral role of the photoreceptor acting as a
light-dependent regulator of the circadian feedback loop, whereas
mammalian CRYs have preserved the role within the circadian feedback
loop but have shed their direct photoreceptor function.

Kume et al. (1999) determined that the mouse Cry1 and Cry2 genes act in
the negative limb of the clock feedback loop. They stated that mouse
Cry1 and Cry2 are nuclear proteins that interact with each of the Per
proteins, translocate each Per protein from cytoplasm to nucleus, and
are rhythmically expressed in the suprachiasmatic circadian clock.
Luciferase reporter gene assays showed that Cry1 or Cry2 alone abrogates
Clock/Bmal1 (602550) E box-mediated transcription. The mouse Per and Cry
proteins appeared to inhibit the transcriptional complex differentially.

Etchegaray et al. (2003) demonstrated that transcriptional regulation of
the core clock mechanism in mouse liver is accompanied by rhythms in H3
histone (see 602810) acetylation, and that H3 acetylation is a potential
target of the inhibitory action of Cry. The promoter regions of the
Per1, Per2, and Cry1 genes exhibited circadian rhythms in H3 acetylation
and RNA polymerase II (see 180660) binding that were synchronous with
the corresponding steady-state mRNA rhythms. The histone
acetyltransferase p300 (602700) precipitated with Clock in vivo in a
time-dependent manner. Moreover, the Cry proteins inhibited a
p300-induced increase in Clock/Bmal1-mediated transcription. Etchegaray
et al. (2003) concluded that the delayed timing of the Cry1 mRNA rhythm,
relative to the Per rhythms, was due to the coordinated activities of
Rev-Erb-alpha (602408) and Clock/Bmal1, and defined a novel mechanism
for circadian phase control.

Lamia et al. (2011) showed that 2 circadian coregulators, Cry1 (601933)
and Cry2, interact with glucocorticoid receptor (138040) in a
ligand-dependent fashion and globally alter the transcriptional response
to glucocorticoids in mouse embryonic fibroblasts: cryptochrome
deficiency vastly decreases gene repression and approximately doubles
the number of dexamethasone-induced genes, suggesting that cryptochromes
broadly oppose glucocorticoid receptor activation and promote
repression. In mice, genetic loss of Cry1 and/or 2 results in glucose
intolerance and constitutively high levels of circulating
corticosterone, suggesting reduced suppression of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis coupled with increased
glucocorticoid transactivation in the liver. Genomically, Cry1 and Cry2
associate with a glucocorticoid response element in the
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-1 (PCK1; 614168) promoter in a
hormone-dependent manner, and dexamethasone-induced transcription of the
Pck1 gene was strikingly increased in cryptochrome-deficient livers.
Lamia et al. (2011) concluded that their results revealed a specific
mechanism through which cryptochromes couple the activity of clock and
receptor target genes to complex genomic circuits underpinning normal
metabolic homeostasis.

In mammals, PERIOD (PER1; 602260 and PER2; 603426) and CRYPTOCHROME
(CRY1 and CRY2) proteins accumulate, form a large nuclear complex (PER
complex), and repress their own transcription. Padmanabhan et al. (2012)
found that mouse PER complexes included RNA helicases DDX5 (180630) and
DHX9 (603115), active RNA polymerase II large subunit (180660), Per and
Cry pre-mRNAs, and SETX (608465), a helicase that promotes
transcriptional termination. During circadian negative feedback, RNA
polymerase II accumulated near termination sites on Per and Cry genes
but not on control genes. Recruitment of PER complexes to the elongating
polymerase at Per and Cry termination sites inhibited SETX action,
impeding RNA polymerase II release and thereby repressing
transcriptional reinitiation. Circadian clock negative feedback thus
includes direct control of transcriptional termination.

MAPPING

Kobayashi et al. (1998) mapped the mouse Cry1 and Cry2 genes to
chromosomes 10C and 2E, respectively. Using a GeneBridge 4 radiation
hybrid panel, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the human CRY2 gene to
chromosome 11.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Xing et al. (2013) reported the crystal structures of mammalian CRY2 in
its apo, FAD-bound, and FBXL3 (605653)-SKP1 (601434)-complexed forms.
Distinct from other cryptochromes, mammalian CRY2 binds FAD dynamically
with an open cofactor pocket. Notably, the F-box protein FBXL3 captures
CRY2 by simultaneously occupying its FAD-binding pocket with a conserved
carboxy-terminal tail and burying its PER-binding interface.

ANIMAL MODEL

Van der Horst et al. (1999) disrupted the Cry1 and Cry2 genes in mice.
Homozygous Cry1 -/-, Cry2 -/-, and double-mutant mice had normal 24-hour
circadian rhythms when exposed to 12h/12h light/dark cycles. In total
darkness, Cry1 -/- mice had a faster running clock (22.51 +/- 0.06h, P =
0.00001) than wildtype mice, while Cry2 -/- mice had a slower clock
(24.63 +/- 0.06 hours, P = 0.00001). Double-mutant mice in total
darkness showed a striking instantaneous and complete arrhythmicity,
indicating the absence of an internal circadian clock. The 'clock'
mutant mouse differs in showing a more gradual onset of arrhythmicity.
Mice with only 1 copy of wildtype Cry2 displayed a free-running rhythm
even shorter than that of Cry1 knockouts, which gradually progressed
into arrhythmicity. Once returned to a light/dark cycle, the normal
24-hour period resumed. Mice with only one functional allele of Cry1
showed rhythmic activity with a period intermediate to those of Cry1 -/-
and Cry2 -/- mice. The authors concluded that their results demonstrated
that the Cry proteins are involved in maintaining period length and
circadian rhythmicity, and that a critical balance between Cry1 and Cry2
is required for proper clock functioning.

Thresher et al. (1998) disrupted the mouse Cry2 gene by homologous
recombination. The mutant mice had lowered sensitivity to acute light
induction of the Per1 gene in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), but
exhibited normal circadian oscillations of Per1 and Cry1 mRNA in the
SCN. Behaviorally, the mutants had an intrinsic circadian period about 1
hour longer than normal and exhibited high amplitude phase shifts in
response to light pulses administered at circadian time 17. The authors
considered these data consistent with the hypothesis that Cry2 protein
modulates circadian responses in mice and suggested that cryptochromes
have a role in circadian photoreception in mammals.

Freedman et al. (1999) studied circadian behavior in mice deficient in
both rods and cones. These mice maintained a light-entrained circadian
rhythm, which they lost with enucleation. Lucas et al. (1999) studied
pineal melatonin secretion in mice lacking both rods and cones. There
was normal suppression of pineal melatonin in response to monochromatic
light of wavelength 509 nm. These authors concluded that mammals have
additional ocular photoreceptors which they use in the regulation of
temporal physiology, and suggested CRY1 and CRY2 as candidates.

Okamura et al. (1999) demonstrated that, in mice lacking Cry1 and Cry2,
cyclic expression of the clock genes Per1 and Per2 is abolished in the
suprachiasmatic nucleus and peripheral tissues and that Per1 and Per2
mRNA levels are constitutively high. These findings indicated that the
biologic clock is eliminated in the absence of both Cry1 and Cry2 and
supported the idea that mammalian CRY proteins act in the negative limb
of the circadian feedback loop. The Cry double mutant mice retained the
ability to have Per1 and Per2 expression induced by a brief light
stimulus known to phase-shift the biologic clock in wildtype animals.
Thus, Cry1 and Cry2 are dispensable for light-induced phase shifting of
the biologic clock.

Shearman et al. (2000) demonstrated that in the mouse, the core
mechanism for the master circadian clock consists of interacting
positive and negative transcription and translation feedback loops.
Analysis of Clock/Clock mutant mice, homozygous Per2 mutants, and
Cry-deficient mice revealed substantially altered Bmal1 rhythms,
consistent with a dominant role of Per2 in the positive regulation of
the Bmal1 loop. In vitro analysis of Cry inhibition of
Clock:Bmal1-mediated transcription shows that the inhibition is through
direct protein-protein interactions, independent of the Per and Tim
proteins. Per2 is a positive regulator of the Bmal1 loop, and Cry1 and
Cry2 are the negative regulators of the Period and Cryptochrome cycles.

Yagita et al. (2001) used wildtype and Cry1 -/- and Cry2 -/- deficient
cell lines derived from Cry mutant mice to demonstrate that the
peripheral oscillator in cultured fibroblasts is identical to the
oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in (1) temporal expression
profiles of all known clock genes; (2) the phase of the various mRNA
rhythms (i.e., antiphase oscillation of Bmal1 (602550) and Per); (3) the
delay between maximum mRNA levels and appearance of nuclear Per1 and
Per2 protein; (4) the inability to produce oscillations in the absence
of functional Cry genes; and (5) the control of period length by Cry
proteins.

Van Gelder et al. (2003) tested pupillary light responses of
cryptochrome mutant mice (Cry1 -/-; Cry2 -/-), outer retinal degenerate
(rd/rd) mice, and mice mutant at all of these loci, as well littermate
controls. There was substantial loss of constriction in the rd/rd mice
compared with control mice. The double mutants for the cryptochromes
showed a pupillary response similar in magnitude to that in control
mice. Almost no pupillary constriction was observed in the triple
knockouts at a 470-nm light intensity. Pupillary responses of the triple
mutants were about 5% as sensitive to blue light as those of the rd/rd
mice. Some pupillary responses were retained in the triple mutant mice
under very bright light, although pupillary movement was somewhat
sluggish. The 50% constriction threshold of pupillary responses was
noted in Cry1 -/-;rd/rd and Cry2 -/-;rd/rd mice, and was comparable to
those of rd/rd mice, indicating that either Cry1 or Cry2 function is
sufficient for retention of pupillary responses in rd/rd animals. Since
all mice were of the same strain background, strain differences were
unlikely to account for the observed differences in pupillary light
responses. Van Gelder et al. (2003) suggested that murine cryptochromes
may function as inner retinal photopigments.
