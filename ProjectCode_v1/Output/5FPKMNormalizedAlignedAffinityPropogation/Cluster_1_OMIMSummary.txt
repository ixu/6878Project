;;STAF36
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CCDC101 is a subunit of 2 histone acetyltransferase complexes: the ADA2A
(TADA2A; 602276)-containing (ATAC) complex and the SPT3 (SUPT3H;
602947)-TAF9 (600822)-GCN5 (KAT2A; 602301)/PCAF (KAT2B; 602303)
acetylase (STAGA) complex. Both of these complexes contain either GCN5
or PCAF, which are paralogous acetyltransferases (Wang et al., 2008).

CLONING

Using mass spectrometry to identify subunits of the ATAC and STAGA
complexes in HeLa cells, Wang et al. (2008) identified CCDC101, which
they called STAF36. STAF36 had an apparent molecular mass of 36 kD by
SDS-PAGE.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the CCDC101 gene to chromosome 16p11.2 based on an
alignment of the CCDC101 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK057008) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;PLASMALEMMA VESICLE PROTEIN 1; PV1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using rat Pv1 as query, Stan et al. (2001) identified ESTs containing
mouse and human PLVAP. They characterized human PLVAP cDNAs from lung,
colon, and pancreas. The deduced 442-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of about 50 kD. PLVAP is a type II integral membrane
protein with a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a single-span
transmembrane domain, and a large C-terminal extracellular domain
consisting mostly of alpha helices. It also contains 2 coiled-coil
domains predicted to contribute to dimer formation. The extracellular
domain has 4 N-glycosylation sites, a proline-rich region, and regular
spacing of cysteine residues. The deduced 439-amino acid mouse Plvap
protein contains a consensus casein kinase II (see 115440)
phosphorylation site that is not found in the human protein. Rat Plvap
contains 2 casein kinase II phosphorylation sites. Northern blot
analysis revealed a single PLVAP transcript of about 2.4 kb in pancreas,
kidney, placenta, muscle, lung, heart, and liver. No signal was detected
in brain or testis. Northern dot blot analysis revealed expression in
several other tissues, including aorta, pituitary, adrenals, mammary
gland, bladder, lymph node, bone marrow, trachea, placenta, and all
segments of the digestive tract from the esophagus to the rectum. No
expression was detected in brain, testis, ovary, leukocytes, and lung.
Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues showed an expression pattern
similar to that found in human tissues, but the quantitative
distribution varied between mouse and human.

Niemela et al. (2005) identified PLVAP as the target of the
pathologische anatomie Leiden-endothelium (PAL-E) antibody, a long used
marker for vascular endothelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Keuschnigg et al. (2009) found that stimulation of human umbilical vein
endothelial cells with TNF (191160) led to redistribution of PV1 to the
peripheral areas of the cells. Transcellular migrating lymphocytes were
surrounded by rings containing PV1 and CAV1 (601047).
Coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy demonstrated that PV1
physically associated with vimentin (VIM; 193060). Anti-PV1 caused a
significant inhibition of lymphocyte transmigration through endothelial
cells, but rolling and adhesion were not affected. In vivo blockade of
Pv1 in mouse acute peritonitis and air pouch models resulted in a
significant decrease in the number of migrating leukocytes. Keuschnigg
et al. (2009) concluded that PV is involved in leukocyte
transendothelial cell migration.

GENE STRUCTURE

Stan et al. (2001) determined that the PLVAP gene contains 6 exons and
spans more than 26 kb. The promoter region contains a classical TATA box
and binding sites for MZF1 (194550), SP1 (189906), RXRA (180245), AP2
(107580), and 3 GATA transcription factors (see 305371).

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and radiation hybrid analysis, Stan et al.
(2001) mapped the PLVAP gene to chromosome 19p13.2, about 25 kb
downstream from BST2 (600534). They mapped the mouse Plvap gene to
chromosome 8B3-C1, a region that shows homology of synteny to human
chromosome 19p13-p12.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the choreoacanthocytosis (200150) critical region on chromosome 9q,
Rampoldi et al. (2001) identified the VPS13A gene, which they called
CHAC. They identified 2 splice variants: transcript A, which contains
exons 1 to 68 and 70 to 73 and encodes a 3,174-amino acid protein, and
transcript B, which contains exons 1 to 69 and encodes a 3,095-amino
acid protein. Northern blot analysis detected 2 bands of high molecular
mass corresponding to the 2 splice variants in all tissues analyzed.
Additionally, RT-PCR detected expression in the erythrocyte precursor
cell line K562. Rampoldi et al. (2001) showed that the CHAC gene encodes
an evolutionarily conserved protein, which may be involved in protein
sorting.

Independently, Ueno et al. (2001) identified the VPS13A gene and found
that it encodes a 3,096-amino acid protein, which they termed chorein.
Northern blot analysis detected a 10-kb transcript in brain, heart,
skeletal muscle, and kidney.

By EST database analysis and RT-PCR of lymphoid cell line and brain RNA,
Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) identified several additional splice
variants of VPS13A generated by exon skipping or utilization of
alternative internal exons. Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR detected
VPS13A expression at variable levels in all tissues examined, and
transcript encoding the 3,174-amino acid protein was the major variant.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rampoldi et al. (2001) determined that the VPS13A gene contains 73 exons
and spans 250 kb. Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) identified 5 additional
alternative exons in the VPS13A gene, exons 7b, 31b, 34b, 68b, and 69b,
but 3 of these, exons 31b, 34b, and 69b, have stop codons in all 3
reading frames.

MAPPING

Rampoldi et al. (2001) mapped the VPS13A gene to chromosome 9q21-q22.
Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) mapped the mouse Vps13a gene to chromosome
19A.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 11 families with choreoacanthocytosis, Rampoldi
et al. (2001) identified 16 different mutations in the VPS13A gene (see,
e.g., 605978.0001).

In 4 affected patients from 3 Japanese pedigrees with
choreoacanthocytosis, Ueno et al. (2001) identified a homozygous
deletion in the coding region of the VPS13A gene (605978.0003).

Among 43 patients with choreoacanthocytosis, Dobson-Stone et al. (2002)
identified 57 different mutations distributed throughout the CHAC gene
(see, e.g., 605978.0004). In 7 patients, only 1 heterozygous mutation
was found; in 4 patients, no disease mutations were found. The authors
noted that small gene deletions or rearrangements may not have been
detected in these patients.

Dobson-Stone et al. (2005) stated that 75 different mutations in the
VPS13A gene had been identified in 58 probands with
choreoacanthocytosis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, ILE90LYS

In a patient with choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Rampoldi et al. (2001)
found compound heterozygosity for a 269T-A transversion in exon 4 of the
VPS13A gene and an insertion of a T between nucleotides 6404 and 6405 in
exon 48. The mutations resulted in an ile90-to-lys (I90K) amino acid
change and a frameshift, respectively.

.0003
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 260-BP DEL

In affected members of 3 Japanese families with choreoacanthocytosis
(200150), Ueno et al. (2001) identified a homozygous 260-bp deletion in
the VPS13A gene, leading to a truncated protein. The families originated
from a small area in Japan, and haplotype analysis indicated a founder
effect. Some of the patients' parents, who were heterozygous for the
mutation, showed a slight degree of acanthocytosis in peripheral blood
but no distinct neurologic abnormalities except for cryptogenic abducens
palsy in 1 parent.

.0004
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, ARG208TER

In 3 patients with choreoacanthocytosis, Dobson-Stone et al. (2002)
identified a 622C-T change in exon 9 of the CHAC gene, resulting in an
arg208-to-ter nonsense substitution (R208X). One patient was homozygous
for the mutation and 2 others were compound heterozygous for R208X and
another CHAC mutation. The R208X mutation had previously been reported
by Rampoldi et al. (2001) in a family with choreoacanthocytosis.

.0005
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 8035G-A

In 2 affected sibs from a Japanese family with choreoacanthocytosis
(200150) with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance, Saiki et al.
(2003) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transversion at the last
nucleotide of exon 57 of the CHAC gene, predicted to induce skipping of
exon 57 and premature termination of the protein. The mutation was not
detected in their unaffected mother. Family history revealed that 3
other living family members were affected and 2 deceased members were
believed to be affected. All 5 living affected members showed
acanthocytosis (approximately 15-20%) and involuntary movements. In an
erratum, the authors stated that an error in sequencing had occurred and
the inheritance pattern should have been reported as autosomal recessive
(pseudodominant). Tomiyasu et al. (2011) identified the 2 mutations in
the VPS13A gene in this family: an 8035G-A transition in exon 57,
causing a frameshift and premature termination (Ile2652HisfsTer12), and
a 1305G-A transition in exon 15, resulting in a trp435-to-ter (W435X;
605978.0010) substitution; the latter mutation was also identified in
the unaffected mother.

.0006
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 1-BP DEL, 6059C

In 2 unrelated males of Ashkenazi Jewish descent with
choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Lossos et al. (2005) identified a
homozygous 1-bp deletion (6059delC) in exon 46 of the VPS13A gene,
predicted to result in premature termination of the protein.

.0007
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 7-KB DEL

In an Iraqi Jewish woman with choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Lossos et
al. (2005) identified a homozygous 7-kb deletion spanning exon 23 of the
VPS13A gene. She had trichotillomania and anxiety but little
neuromuscular involvement.

.0008
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 37-KB DEL

In affected members of 3 French Canadian families with
choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Dobson-Stone et al. (2005) identified a
homozygous 37-kb deletion in the VPS13A gene, resulting in the deletion
of exons 70 through 73. The deletion also encompassed the 2 terminal
exons of the neighboring GNA14 gene (604397). Haplotype analysis
indicated a founder effect.

.0009
CHOREOACANTHOCYTOSIS
VPS13A, 2-BP DUP, 3556AC

In 2 Mexican mestizo sisters, born of consanguineous parents, with
choreoacanthocytosis (200150), Ruiz-Sandoval et al. (2007) identified a
homozygous 2-bp duplication (3556dupAC) in exon 33 of the VPS13A gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The proband had
onset at age 32 years and showed severe progression of the disorder; at
age 42, she was emaciated, anarthric, and reactive only to simple
commands. In contrast, her sister had onset at age 45 years and
primarily showed motor and verbal tics, paranoid behavior, and
depression.

;;SGC32445;;
CHROMOSOME 5 OPEN READING FRAME 19; C5ORF19
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lai et al. (2001) identified C5ORF19, which they called SGC32445, within
a region of chromosome 5q frequently deleted in malignant myelomas. The
deduced 152-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about
17 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of about 2.2 kb.
C5ORF19 expression was abundant in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle,
low in placenta, kidney, and pancreas, and absent in lung and liver.

Transport of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the cell surface
membrane is critical for receptor-ligand recognition. However, mammalian
GPCR odorant receptors (ORs), when heterologously expressed in cells,
are poorly expressed on the cell surface. By screening for genes that
induced cell surface expression of ORs expressed in human embryonic
kidney cells, Saito et al. (2004) identified mouse and human REEP1
(609139). They searched databases for homologs of REEP1 and identified
several other REEP genes, including REEP2. In situ hybridization of
mouse olfactory epithelium revealed that, unlike Reep1, Reep2 was not
expressed in olfactory neurons.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lai et al. (2001) determined that the C5ORF19 gene contains 8 exons and
spans more than 7 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lai et al. (2001) mapped the REEP2 gene to
chromosome 5q31.

608387	TITLE *608387 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 213; ZNF213
;;CR53
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

C2H2 zinc finger proteins, such as ZNF213, have bipartite structures in
which one domain binds DNA or RNA and the other modulates target gene
expression.

CLONING

By sequencing candidate genes within the FMF locus (249100) on
chromosome 16, PCR of fetal brain, fetal liver, and lymph node cDNA
libraries, and screening a peripheral blood leukocyte cDNA library, Chen
et al. (1999) cloned ZNF213. The deduced 424-amino acid protein contains
an N-terminal leucine-rich domain, followed by a Kruppel-associated box
and C-terminal zinc fingers. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.8-kb
transcript in all tissues examined. Highest expression was detected in
testis, followed by ovary, small intestine, prostate, spleen, thymus,
mucosal lining of colon, and peripheral blood lymphocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (1999) determined that the ZNF213 gene contains 7 exons and
spans about 8.0 kb. The 5-prime untranslated region is GC rich.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Bernot et al. (1998) mapped the ZNF213
gene, which they designated CR53, to chromosome 16p13.3. The gene is
oriented with its 5-prime end toward the telomere. Chen et al. (1999)
determined that the ZNF213 gene lies within a ZNF gene cluster that
includes ZNF263 (604191) and ZNF174 (603900).

604470	TITLE *604470 CD2 ANTIGEN-BINDING PROTEIN 2; CD2BP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Human CD2 (186990) facilitates both adhesion and activation of T
lymphocytes on binding to its ligand CD58 (LFA3; 153420). This binding
augments interleukin-12 (IL12; see 161560)-driven T-cell responsiveness.
By use of interaction trap cloning with the yeast 2-hybrid system and
5-prime RACE PCR, Nishizawa et al. (1998) identified a T-cell line cDNA
encoding a 341-amino acid protein, termed CD2BP2, that interacts with
the cytoplasmic tail of CD2. The authors noted that a segment near the C
terminus contains a consensus site for tyrosine phosphorylation. RNA
blot analysis indicated that CD2BP2 is expressed in a wide variety of
organs as approximately 1.35- and 4-kb transcripts. Immunoprecipitation
experiments showed that CD2BP2 expressed in J77 Jurkat and COS-7 cells
associates specifically with CD2. Mutation analysis suggested that a
21-amino acid motif is critical for CD2 binding and that 2 PPPGHR
sequences within the CD2 cytoplasmic tail mediate the binding to CD2BP2.
Additional transfection studies showed that CD2BP2 expression
selectively enhances IL2 (147680) production on crosslinking of CD2.

DESCRIPTION For background information on histones, histone gene clusters, and the
H1 histone family, see HIST1H1A (142709).

CLONING

Drabent et al. (1991) studied the structure and expression of H1T, the
gene for testis-specific histone H1.

GENE FUNCTION

Deng et al. (1994) found that the rat H1t locus cosegregated with blood
pressure in an F2 population derived from a cross of the Dahl
salt-sensitive strain and the Lewis strain. Thus, H1t in rat is a
quantitative trait locus for blood pressure.

See HIST1H1A (142709) for additional functional information on H1
histones.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization, Albig et
al. (1993) demonstrated that the H1T gene is located in a cluster with 5
other H1 histone genes on chromosome 6p22.2-p21.1. By analysis of a YAC
contig, Albig et al. (1997) mapped the H1FT gene to chromosome 6p21.3
within a cluster of 35 histone genes, including H1.1 (HIST1H1A; 142709)
to H1.4 (HIST1H1E; 142220). The H1.5 gene (HIST1H1B; 142711) is part of
a separate subcluster within the same chromosomal region.

By genomic sequence analysis, Marzluff et al. (2002) determined that the
histone gene cluster on chromosome 6p22-p21, which they called histone
gene cluster-1 (HIST1), contains 55 histone genes, including HIST1H1T.

Deng et al. (1994) reported that the rat testis-specific H1 histone gene
maps to chromosome 17,

180246	TITLE *180246 RETINOID X RECEPTOR, BETA; RXRB
DESCRIPTION The retinoic acid receptors, alpha (RARA; 180240), beta (RARB; 180220),
and gamma (RARG; 180190), require coregulators to bind effectively to
response elements and target genes. By a strategy of sequential
screening of expression libraries with a retinoic acid response element
and RAR, Yu et al. (1991) identified a cDNA encoding a coregulator
highly related to RXR-alpha (180245). This protein, termed RXR-beta,
formed heterodimers with RAR, preferentially increasing its DNA binding
and transcriptional activity on promoters containing retinoic acid, but
not thyroid hormone or vitamin D, response elements. Remarkably,
RXR-beta also heterodimerized with thyroid hormone and vitamin D
receptors, increasing both DNA binding and transcriptional function on
their respective response elements. RXR-alpha also formed heterodimers
with these receptors. These observations suggested that retinoid X
receptors meet the criteria for biochemically characterized cellular
coregulators and serve to target selectively the high affinity binding
of retinoic acid, thyroid hormone, and vitamin D receptors to their
cognate DNA response elements.

RARB, RARG, RXRB, and RXRG (180247) are expressed in the striatum. To
study the effect of these genes on locomotion, Kreczel et al. (1998)
developed single and double knockout mice and analyzed their locomotor
skills by open field and rotarod testing. RARB-RXRB, RARB-RXRG, and
RXRB-RXRG double-null mutant mice, but not the corresponding single-null
mutants, exhibited reductions in forward locomotion when compared with
wildtype littermates. Forty percent of the RARB-RXRB-null mutants showed
backward locomotion. Rotarod test performance was impaired for RARB,
RARB-RXRB, RARB-RXRG, and RXRB-RXRG mice. In contrast, RARA, RARG,
RARA-RXRG, and RARG-RXRG-null mice showed no defects in locomotion, even
though both RARA and RARG are also expressed in the striatum. The
morphology, development, and function of skeletal muscle, peripheral
nerves, and spinal cord were normal in all single and double-null
mutants, as were balance reflexes. These results suggested to Kreczel et
al. (1998) that RARB, RXRB, and RXRG are involved specifically in the
control of locomotor behaviors, and that heterodimers of RARB with
either RXRB or RXRG are the functional receptor units, such that RXRB
and RXRG are functionally redundant. Kreczel et al. (1998) studied the
expression of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors (D1R; 126449 and D2R;
126450), the most abundant dopamine receptors in the striatum, in these
mutant mice. RARB-RXRB, RARB-RXRG, and RXRB-RXRG double-null mutants,
but not RARB or RXRG single mutants, exhibited 40% and 30% reduction in
whole-striatal D1R and D2R transcripts, respectively, when compared with
wildtype controls. The reduction was mostly in the medioventral regions
of the striatum, including the shell and core of the nucleus accumbens,
and the mediodorsal part of the caudate putamen. The reduction was not
due to loss of D2R-expressing neurons; no increase in apoptosis was
noted. The histology of the striatum was normal. The characterization of
a retinoic acid response element in the D2R promoter by Samad et al.
(1997) led Kreczel et al. (1998) to suggest that the reduction in D2R
and D2R expression occurs on a transcriptional level. The RARB-RXRB,
RARB-RXRG, and RXRB-RXRG double-null mutants did not exhibit the normal
increase in locomotion induced by cocaine, mimicking the phenotype of
D1R-null mice. Taken together, these results indicated to Kreczel et al.
(1998) that retinoids are involved in controlling the function of the
dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway and suggested that defects in retinoic
acid signaling may contribute to disorders such as Parkinson disease and
schizophrenia.

Using RFLVs in interspecific backcross mice, Hoopes et al. (1992) mapped
the Rxrb gene to the H-2 region of chromosome 17. By homology, it is
likely that the RXRB gene in the human is located on 6p. Fleischhauer et
al. (1993) demonstrated that this is indeed the case. They showed that
the RXRB gene is located in the 6pter-q13 region by Southern
hybridization of genomic DNA from human/rodent cell hybrids with the
mouse gene as a probe. In addition, a full-length cDNA clone encoding a
human RXRB was isolated by nucleic acid screening of a human cDNA
library with a fragment of the mouse gene as a probe. Comparison of
human and murine RXRB showed 97.6% identity on the amino acid level and
91.6% on the nucleotide level. With the relatively crude mapping methods
used, Fleischhauer et al. (1993) could not map RXRB more precisely than
to the short arm of chromosome 6 and/or the proximal part of the long
arm; however, the findings are at least consistent with location in the
HLA region, as suggested by homology. Fitzgibbon et al. (1993) mapped
the RXRB gene to 6p21.3-p21.1 by PCR amplification of 5-prime
untranslated sequence in panels of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids and
to 6p21.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. By pairwise
hybridization of an RXRB cosmid and reference markers in fluorescence in
situ hybridization, Almasan et al. (1994) likewise mapped the RXRB gene
to 6p21.3. Using cosmid clones that cover the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) region, Nagata et al. (1995) determined the precise
physical map positions of the RXRB gene relative to the MHC genes in
mouse and human. Conservation of gene organization was observed between
the 2 species at the HLA-DP (142880) region.

In an elegant series of experiments designed to understand the effect of
RXR activation on cholesterol balance, Repa et al. (2000) treated
animals with the rexinoid LG268. Animals treated with rexinoid exhibited
marked changes in cholesterol balance, including inhibition of
cholesterol absorption and repressed bile acid synthesis. Studies with
receptor-selective agonists revealed that oxysterol receptors (LXRs, see
602423 and 600380) and the bile acid receptor, FXR (603826), are the RXR
heterodimeric partners that mediate these effects by regulating
expression of the reverse-cholesterol transporter, ABC1 (600046), and
the rate-limiting enzyme of bile acid synthesis, CYP7A1 (118455),
respectively. These RXR heterodimers serve as key regulators in
cholesterol homeostasis by governing reverse cholesterol transport from
peripheral tissues, bile acid synthesis in liver, and cholesterol
absorption in intestine. Activation of RXR/LXR heterodimers inhibits
cholesterol absorption by upregulation of ABC1 expression in the small
intestine. Activation of RXR/FXR heterodimers represses CYP7A1
expression and bile acid production, leading to a failure to solubilize
and absorb cholesterol. Studies have shown that RXR/FXR-mediated
repression of CYP7A1 is dominant over RXR/LXR-mediated induction of
CYP7A1, which explains why the rexinoid represses rather than activates
CYP7A1 (Lu et al., 2000). Activation of the LXR signaling pathway
results in the upregulation of ABC1 in peripheral cells, including
macrophages, to efflux free cholesterol for transport back to the liver
through high density lipoprotein, where it is converted to bile acids by
the LXR-mediated increase in CYP7A1 expression. Secretion of biliary
cholesterol in the presence of increased bile acid pools normally
results in enhanced reabsorption of cholesterol; however, with the
increased expression of ABC1 and efflux of cholesterol back into the
lumen, there is a reduction in cholesterol absorption and net excretion
of cholesterol and bile acid. Rexinoids therefore offer a novel class of
agents for treating elevated cholesterol.

614971	TITLE *614971 TAURINE-UPREGULATED GENE 1, NONCODING; TUG1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), such as TUG1, are thought to
be involved in long-range control of chromatin structure and gene
expression (Khalil et al., 2009).

CLONING

Young et al. (2005) cloned 3 splice variants of mouse Tug1, and they
identified 4 possible splice variants of human TUG1. The human cDNAs
were 3.3, 5.9, 6.4, and 9.7 kb long. Only a single putative 51-residue
ORF within an adequate Kozak context was conserved between mouse and
human, but it was not included in all mouse and human TUG1 variants.
Northern blot analysis detected highest Tug1 expression in mouse cortex
and retina, with lower expression in heart and kidney and weak
expression in muscle and spleen. In situ hybridization revealed Tug1
expression in several areas of the mouse central nervous system at
postnatal day 0, including spinal cord, olfactory epithelium,
hippocampus, and cortex. In developing mouse retina, Tug1 expression
peaked between embryonic day 18 and postnatal day 6. EST database
analysis detected high TUG1 expression in a variety of human tissues.
Young et al. (2005) also detected weak expression of a mouse cDNA that
originated from the Tug1 opposite strand. Database analysis revealed
orthologs of TUG1 in several mammals, but not in lower vertebrates,
nematodes, or flies.

Khalil et al. (2009) developed a method of identifying lincRNAs based on
a distinctive chromatin signature that marked actively transcribed genes
and then selecting for genes that lacked protein-coding potential. Using
this method, they identified TUG1. TUG1 was ubiquitously expressed in
human and mouse tissues and cells. RNA FISH detected TUG1 localized to
nuclear and cytoplasmic foci in human fetal foot fibroblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

Young et al. (2005) showed that taurine upregulated expression of mouse
Tub1 in retina. Knockdown of Tug1 variants in mouse eyes via
electroporation of small interfering RNAs resulted in disrupted retinal
morphology, which was accompanied by signs of apoptosis and altered
retinal gene expression.

Khalil et al. (2009) showed that TUG1 coimmunoprecipitated with SUZ12
(606245), a component of polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2) in human
fetal lung and foot fibroblasts and HeLa cells. TUG1 also
coimmunoprecipitated with the COREST (RCOR; 607675) repressive complex.
TUG1 expression was induced by p53 (TP53; 191170) in response to DNA
damage. Depletion of TUG1 via small interfering RNA resulted in
upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle regulation in fetal lung
and foot fibroblasts. Khalil et al. (2009) concluded that TUG1 is
induced by p53 and represses gene expression via interaction with PCR2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Young et al. (2005) determined that the TUG1 gene contains 3 exons and
spans about 10 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Young et al. (2005) mapped the TUG1 gene
to chromosome 22q12.2. They mapped the mouse Tug1 gene to chromosome
11A1.

142100	TITLE *142100 HEMOGLOBIN--EPSILON LOCUS; HBE1
DESCRIPTION The epsilon locus determines the epsilon, or non-alpha, chain of
embryonic hemoglobin (originally known as Gower-2). No mutations
affecting the epsilon chain have yet been identified. Gower-1 is a
tetramer of epsilon chains. The epsilon locus may be linked to the
delta-beta complex. The amino acid sequence of the epsilon chain is
similar to those of the delta and beta chains. Furthermore, the
homologous chain in the mouse is linked to the beta locus (Gilman and
Smithies, 1968). Shen and Smithies (1982) determined the complete
nucleotide sequence of the 3.4-kb stretch of DNA 5-prime to the epsilon
gene where a pseudogene (psi-beta-2) was thought to reside (Fritsch et
al., 1980). They concluded that no globin-related gene exists there and
provided a possible explanation for the earlier contrary conclusion. By
studies in transgenic mice, Raich et al. (1992) demonstrated that
deletion of a 'negative element' located between -182 and -467 bp
upstream of the HBE gene cap site resulted in continuation of HBE gene
expression in the definitive erythroblasts of the fetal liver and in the
red blood cells of adult animals. The findings provided direct in vivo
evidence that cis-acting silencing elements are involved in the
developmental control of the HBE gene.

Bailey et al. (1992) used the epsilon-globin gene to examine the debate
as to whether all bats fall into a monophyletic order (Chiroptera) or
have diphyletic origins with the megabats actually being 'flying
primates.' Results of parsimony analysis supported bat monophyly.

He and Russell (2002) analyzed the anti-sickling properties of HBE both
in vitro as well as in vivo in a well-established mouse model of sickle
cell anemia (603903). These animals, expressing 100% of human Hb S
(141900.0243), display a chronic hemolytic anemia with compensatory
marrow and extramedullary erythropoiesis, abundant circulating sickled
erythrocytes, and chronic tissue damage evidenced by parallel
histopathologic and functional deficits. By comparison, related mice
that coexpress Hb S as well as HBE exhibited normal physiologic,
morphologic, histologic, and functional attributes. Subsequent in vitro
analyses substantiated results from whole-animal studies, indicating
that the polymerization of deoxygenated Hb S can be significantly slowed
by relatively small quantities of HBE. Together, the in vivo and in
vitro analyses suggested that reactivation of epsilon-globin gene
expression would be therapeutically beneficial to adults with sickle
phenotypes, and provide a rationale for detailed investigations into the
molecular basis for its developmental silencing.

613904	TITLE *613904 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 569; ZNF569
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZNF569 belongs to a large family of transcription factors characterized
by an N-terminal Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain and tandem
C-terminal C2H2-type zinc fingers (Huang et al., 2006).

CLONING

Using the KRAB domain consensus sequence to search EST databases,
followed by PCR of an early embryonic human heart cDNA library, Huang et
al. (2006) cloned ZNF569. The deduced 686-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 79.6 kD. It has a classical N-terminal
KRAB-A domain, followed by 18 tandem Kruppel C2H2-type zinc fingers
extending to the C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected high
expression of a 2.06-kb ZNF569 transcript in adult heart, skeletal
muscle, and liver and in fetal heart, skeletal muscle, and brain. It was
also expressed more weakly in adult and fetal pancreas and placenta,
with little to no expression detected in other tissues.
Fluorescence-tagged ZNF569 localized predominantly to nuclei of
transfected COS-7 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By cotransfecting COS-7 cells with ZNF569 and a reporter gene system,
Huang et al. (2006) showed that ZNF569 suppressed the endogenous
transcriptional activities of the serum response element (SRE) and AP1
(165160). Domain analysis revealed that both the KRAB domain and the
zinc finger motifs of ZNF569 suppressed transcriptional activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Huang et al. (2006) determined that the ZNF569 gene contains 6 exons and
spans approximately 56.3 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Huang et al. (2006) mapped the ZNF569 gene
to chromosome 19q13.12.

608167	TITLE *608167 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, SUBFAMILY T, MEMBER 1; KCNT1
;;KIAA1422;;
SLACK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The KCNT1 gene encodes a sodium-activated potassium channel that is
widely expressed in the nervous system. Its activity contributes to the
slow hyperpolarization that follows repetitive firing. The C-terminal
cytoplasmic domain interacts with a protein network, including FMRP
(30955), suggesting additional functions (summary by Barcia et al.,
2012).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned KCNT1, which they designated
KIAA1422. The deduced 1,151-amino acid protein shares 94% identity with
the rat Slack potassium channel subunit. RT-PCR detected moderate to
high expression of KCNT1 in all tissues examined. Highest expression was
detected in adult and fetal liver and brain, in spinal cord, and in most
specific brain regions examined. Lowest expression was detected in
skeletal muscle.

Barcia et al. (2012) found expression of the Kcnt1 gene in murine
embryonic neurons in the hippocampus and cortex.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the KCNT1 gene
to chromosome 9.

GENE FUNCTION

Using biochemical and electrophysiologic studies in mice, Brown et al.
(2010) found that the mRNA-binding protein FMRP (309550) binds to the C
terminus of the Kcnt1 gene to activate the channel. The findings
suggested a link between patterns of neuronal firing and changes in
protein translation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 14/Malignant Migrating
Partial Seizures of Infancy

In 6 (50%) of 12 unrelated patients with sporadic occurrence of early
infantile epileptic encephalopathy-14 (EIEE14; 614959) clinically
manifest as malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy (MMPSI),
Barcia et al. (2012) identified 4 different de novo heterozygous
mutations in the KCNT1 gene (608167.0001-608167.0004). The first 2
mutations were identified by exome sequencing. Expression of 2 of the
corresponding rat mutations in Xenopus oocytes resulted in
Kcnt1-generated currents that resembled wildtype in terms of voltage
dependence and kinetic behavior but had 2- to 3-fold higher amplitude
compared to wildtype, consistent with a gain of function. The mutations
were shown to cause constitutive activation of the Kcnt1 channel,
mimicking the effects of phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain by
protein kinase C (see, e.g., PRKCA; 176960) activation. All patients had
onset of refractory focal seizures and arrest of psychomotor development
in the first 6 months of life. Brain MRI of some showed delayed
myelination. EEG showed characteristic multifocal, migrating discharges.
The findings suggested that KCNT1 is a major disease-associated gene for
the MMPSI phenotype.

- Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy 5

In affected members of 4 unrelated families with autosomal dominant
nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy-5 (ENFL5; 615005), Heron et al. (2012)
identified 4 different heterozygous mutations in the KCNT1 gene
(608167.0005-608167.0008). The initial mutation was found after linkage
analysis and whole-exome capture and sequencing in a large family
previously reported by Derry et al. (2008). Affected individuals had
childhood onset of partial motor seizures arising during sleep. Some
developed behavioral/psychiatric manifestations and showed varying
degrees of intellectual disability.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, EARLY INFANTILE, 14
KCNT1, ARG428GLN

In 3 unrelated patients of French origin with early infantile epileptic
encephalopathy-14 (EIEE14; 614959) manifest clinically as malignant
migrating partial seizures of infancy (MMPSI), Barcia et al. (2012)
identified a de novo heterozygous 1283G-A transition in exon 13 of the
KCNT1 gene, resulting in an arg428-to-gln (R428Q) substitution at a
highly conserved residue in the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. The
mutation was initially identified by exome sequencing and confirmed by
Sanger sequencing in 1 patient; analysis of this gene in subsequent
patients identified the same mutation in 2 other individuals with the
same disorder. The mutation was not found in 200 controls or in several
large control databases. Expression of the corresponding rat mutation,
R409Q, in Xenopus oocytes resulted in Kcnt1-generated currents that
resembled wildtype in terms of voltage dependence and kinetic behavior
but had 2- to 3-fold higher amplitude compared to wildtype, consistent
with a gain of function. The mutation was shown to cause constitutive
activation of the Kcnt1 channel, mimicking the effects of
phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain by protein kinase C (see, e.g.,
PRKCA; 176960) activation.

EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, EARLY INFANTILE, 14
KCNT1, ALA934THR

In a patient of French origin with EIEE14 (614959) manifest clinically
as MMPSI, Barcia et al. (2012) identified a de novo heterozygous 2800G-A
transition in exon 24 of the KCNT1 gene, resulting in an ala934-to-thr
(A934T) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the cytoplasmic
C-terminal domain. The mutation was identified by exome sequencing and
confirmed by Sanger sequencing; it was not found in 200 controls or in
several large control databases. Expression of the corresponding rat
mutation, A913T, in Xenopus oocytes resulted in Kcnt1-generated currents
that resembled wildtype in terms of voltage dependence and kinetic
behavior but had 2- to 3-fold higher amplitude compared to wildtype,
consistent with a gain of function. The mutation was shown to cause
constitutive activation of the Kcnt1 channel, mimicking the effects of
phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain by protein kinase C (see, e.g.,
PRKCA; 176960) activation.

KCNT1, ARG474HIS

In a patient of French origin with EIEE14 (614959) manifest clinically
as MMPSI, Barcia et al. (2012) identified a de novo heterozygous 1421G-A
transition in exon 15 of the KCNT1 gene, resulting in an arg474-to-his
(R474H) substitution at a highly conserved residue.

EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, EARLY INFANTILE, 14
KCNT1, ILE760MET

In a patient of Ukrainian origin with EIEE14 (614959) manifest
clinically as MMPSI, Barcia et al. (2012) identified a de novo
heterozygous 2280C-G transversion in exon 20 of the KCNT1 gene,
resulting in an ile760-to-met (I760M) substitution at a highly conserved
residue.

EPILEPSY, NOCTURNAL FRONTAL LOBE, 5
KCNT1, ARG928CYS

In 6 affected members of an Australian family of British descent with
autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy-5 (ENFL5; 615005)
(family B of Derry et al., 2008), Heron et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous 2782C-T transition in the KCNT1 gene, resulting in an
arg928-to-cys (R928C) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
intracellular C-terminal region adjacent to an NAD(+)-binding site. The
mutation, which was identified by whole-exome capture and sequencing and
confirmed by Sanger sequencing, segregated with the phenotype in this
family and was not identified in 111 control samples or in several large
control databases. No functional studies were performed. The mean age at
seizure onset was 4.6 years, and 5 of the 6 had refractory seizures and
behavioral or psychiatric problems. Three had intellectual disability.

EPILEPSY, NOCTURNAL FRONTAL LOBE, 5
KCNT1, TYR796HIS

In 4 individuals of a 3-generation Italian family with ENFL5 (615005),
Heron et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 2386T-C transition in the
KCNT1 gene, resulting in a tyr796-to-his (Y796H) substitution at a
highly conserved residue in the intracellular C-terminal region adjacent
to an NAD(+)-binding site. No functional studies were performed. The
mean age of seizure onset was 5.5 years. Three patients had intellectual
disability, and 2 had behavioral or psychiatric abnormalities.

In 4 affected individuals of an Israeli family with ENFL5 (615005),
Heron et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 1193G-A transition in the
KCNT1 gene, resulting in an arg398-to-gln (R398Q) substitution. No
functional studies were performed. Two of the 4 patients had behavioral
or psychiatric abnormalities, but all were cognitively normal.

.0008
EPILEPSY, NOCTURNAL FRONTAL LOBE, 5
KCNT1, MET896ILE

In an Australian boy of British descent with ENFL5 (615005), Heron et
al. (2012) identified a de novo heterozygous 2688G-A transition in the
KCNT1 gene, resulting in a met896-to-ile (M896I) substitution at a
highly conserved residue within the NAD(+)-binding site. No functional
studies were performed. The patient had onset of refractory seizures at
age 9 years and showed a behavioral/psychiatric disorder, but had normal
intellectual function.
