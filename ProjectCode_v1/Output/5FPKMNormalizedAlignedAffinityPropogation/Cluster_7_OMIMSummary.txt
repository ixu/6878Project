;;PFKFB, CARDIAC
DESCRIPTION Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate is an intracellular regulatory molecule that
controls glycolysis in all eukaryotic tissues by integrating hormonal
and metabolic signals. The synthesis and degradation of fructose
2,6-bisphosphate are catalyzed by 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (EC
2.7.1.105) and fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.46), respectively.
In liver, these 2 activities belong to the same polypeptide encoded by
the gene PFKFB1, which also encodes the muscle isozyme and is located on
the X chromosome (311790). The heart isozyme is encoded by a separate
gene, which Hilliker et al. (1991) showed, by means of probes generated
by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to be located on 1q31 in the
human and 13q24-q25 in the rat. The mapping was done by analysis of
somatic cell hybrids and followed by in situ hybridization.

188230	TITLE *188230 THY-1 T-CELL ANTIGEN; THY1
;;THETA ANTIGEN;;
CD90 ANTIGEN; CD90
DESCRIPTION Thy-1 is the designation for a major cell surface glycoprotein
characteristic to T cells, as first defined in the mouse and rat (Raff,
1971; Letarte-Muirhead et al., 1975). The Thy-1 glycoproteins are
constituents of thymocytes and neurons and probably are involved in
cell-cell interactions. The putative human homolog of Thy-1 of the mouse
is called K117. The human homolog of the rodent antigen was studied by
Ades et al. (1980). Using a monoclonal antibody, McKenzie and Fabre
(1981) studied the tissue distribution of the antigen. By use of a gene
clone in somatic cell hybrids, Seki et al. (1985) assigned the THY1 gene
to chromosome 11. Van den Elsen et al. (1985) predicted that the human
Thy-1 homolog maps to chromosome 11 because that is where they found T3D
(186790) to map and in the mouse T3D and Thy-1 map to chromosome 9 along
with certain other loci that are on human 11q. A multigene family is a
group of homologous genes with similar function. A supergene family is a
set of multigene families and single genes related by sequence (implying
common ancestry) but not necessarily related in function. Hood et al.
(1985) refer to the immunoglobulin supergene family which includes
Thy-1, poly-Ig receptor, heavy, kappa and lambda immunoglobulins, Lyt-2
(T8), alpha and beta chains of T-cell antigen receptor and the closely
homologous gamma chain, class I MHC antigen, beta-2-microglobulin, and
the alpha and beta chains of class II MHC antigens. Thy-1 is
structurally the simplest of these, consisting of a single
immunoglobulin homology unit that is either intermediate between V and C
or somewhat more similar to a V homology unit (Williams and Gagnon,
1982). The Thy-1 glycoprotein is also exceptional in that it is on the
cell surface as a free homology unit and apparently does not associate
either with itself or with other polypeptides. Its role in immune
response is unclear. It is expressed on fibroblasts and brain cells in
addition to some T cells. The significant role of Thy-1 in developing
nervous tissue (Morris, 1985) may be of relevance to disorders such as
ataxia-telangiectasia (208900) that combine neurologic and immunologic
defects. By somatic cell and in situ hybridization, van Rijs et al.
(1985) localized the gene to 11q23-11q24. Rettig et al. (1985) assigned
the gene to 11q13-qter, by Southern analysis of DNA from hybrid cells
containing rearranged chromosomes 11. HGM7 gave the regional assignment
as 11q22.3. Tunnacliffe and McGuire (1990) constructed a physical map of
11q23 by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and showed that THY1 lies in
11q23.3 as the most telomeric of a group of 6 genes:
cen--CD3E--CD3D--CD3G--PBGD--CBL2--THY1--qter.

Chromosome 11 seems to carry an inordinately large number of genes for
cell surface antigens (Rettig et al., 1985); according to the 1985
workshop on Human Gene Mapping (Grzeschik and Kazazian, 1985), at least
21 cellular antigens recognized by monoclonal antibodies and other
serologic means map to 11. Mansour et al. (1987) gave a useful history
of our understanding of the Thy-1 glycoprotein and a review of its
evolution. Using RFLPs, Gatti et al. (1987) mapped the THY1 gene against
APOA1 (107680). THY1 appeared to be distal to APOA1; there was 1%
recombination between the 2 loci in males and 2% in females. Gatti et
al. (1988) demonstrated RFLPs in the THY1 gene that are potentially
useful as markers in linkage studies. Greenspan and O'Brien (1989)
showed in the mouse that a factor secreted by nonneuronal accessory
cells of dorsal root ganglion cultures stimulates neurite outgrowth in
neonatal sympathetic ganglion neurons. They presented evidence that this
is identical to Thy-1. It is this function in separate tissues that
might explain pleiotropic manifestations of some syndromes such as
ataxia-telangiectasia (208900) or cartilage-hair hypoplasia (250250).

Cao et al. (2001) found that introduction of chromosome 11 completely
suppressed tumorigenicity of the highly malignant and tumorigenic
ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3 but introduction of chromosome 17 could
only partially suppress tumorigenicity. Microcell-mediated chromosome
transfer was applied to introduce a normal copy of chromosome 11 into
SKOV-3 cells; a panel of 5 hybrid clones were generated. Two of the
clones were completely nontumorigenic in severe combined
immunodeficiency (SCID) mice for up to 150 and 200 days; 2 other clones
had a latency period of 123 and 109 days, respectively. In vitro cell
doubling time was found to be highly variable and did not correlate with
tumorigenicity, implying that suppression of in vivo tumorigenicity and
in vitro cell proliferation are under separate genetic control. A number
of studies had demonstrated a high frequency of loss of heterozygosity
(LOH) of chromosome 11, both 11p and 11q, in ovarian cancer. To identify
the gene or genes associated with tumor suppression in the ovarian cell
line SKOV-3, Abeysinghe et al. (2003) performed cDNA subtractive
hybridization using a suppression subtractive hybridization method.
Using this approach, they identified the differential expression of the
cell surface glycoprotein THY1, the gene for which maps to 11q23.3. The
expression of THY1 was found to be exclusive in the 2 nontumorigenic
clones as determined by Northern blot analysis at the mRNA level and by
immunocytochemistry and quantitative flow cytometry at the protein
expression level. Several genes related to cell growth and
differentiation were found to be upregulated in the nontumorigenic
clones, including THBS1 (188060), SPARC (182120), and fibronectin
(135600).

601613	TITLE *601613 CHEMOKINE, CXC MOTIF, RECEPTOR 5; CXCR5
;;BURKITT LYMPHOMA RECEPTOR 1; BLR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dobner et al. (1992) and Kaiser et al. (1993) identified a novel member
of the G protein-coupled receptor family termed BLR1 (BLR1 having been
identified from Burkitt lymphoma).

GENE FUNCTION

B lymphocytes recirculate between B cell-rich compartments (follicles or
B zones) in secondary lymphoid organs, surveying for antigen. After
antigen binding, B cells move to the boundary of B and T zones to
interact with T-helper cells. Reif et al. (2002) demonstrated that
antigen-engaged B cells have increased expression of CCR7 (600242), the
receptor for the T-zone chemokines CCL19 (602227) and CCL21 (602737),
and that they exhibit increased responsiveness to both chemoattractants.
In mice lacking lymphoid CCL19 and CCL21 chemokines, or with B cells
that lack CCR7, antigen engagement fails to cause movement to the T
zone. Using retroviral-mediated gene transfer, the authors demonstrated
that increased expression of CCR7 is sufficient to direct B cells to the
T zone. Reciprocally, overexpression of CXCR5, the receptor for the
B-zone chemokine CXCL13 (also known as BLC), is sufficient to overcome
antigen-induced B-cell movement to the T zone. Reif et al. (2002)
concluded that their findings defined the mechanism of B-cell
relocalization in response to antigen, and established that cell
position in vivo can be determined by the balance of responsiveness to
chemoattractants made in separate but adjacent zones.

Chan et al. (2003) investigated the expression of chemokines and
chemokine receptors in eyes with primary intraocular B-cell lymphoma
(PIOL). All 3 PIOL eyes showed similar pathology, with typical diffuse
large B-lymphoma cells between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and
Bruch membrane. The eyes also showed a similar chemokine profile with
the expression of CXCR4 (162643) and CXCR5 in the lymphoma cells. CXCL13
(BLC) and CXCL12 (600835) transcripts were found only in the RPE and not
in the malignant cells. No chemokine expression was detected on the RPE
cells of a normal control eye. Since chemokines and chemokine receptors
selective for B cells were identified in RPE and malignant B cells in
eyes with PIOL, inhibition of B-cell chemoattractants might be a future
strategy for the treatment of PIOL.

The germinal center (GC) is organized into dark and light zones. B cells
in the dark zone, called centroblasts, undergo rapid proliferation and
somatic hypermutation of their antibody variable genes. Centroblasts
then become smaller, nondividing centrocytes and undergo selection in
the light zone based on the affinity of their surface antibody for the
inducing antigen. The light zone also contains helper T cells and
follicular dendritic cells that sequester antigen. Failure to
differentiate results in centrocyte apoptosis, whereas centrocytes that
bind antigen and receive T-cell help emigrate from the GC as long-lived
plasma cells or memory B cells. Some centrocytes may also return to the
dark zone for further proliferation and mutation. Using genetic and
pharmacologic approaches, Allen et al. (2004) showed that CXCR4 was
essential for GC dark and light zone segregation. In the presence of the
antiapoptotic BCL2 (151430), B cells had robust chemotactic responses to
the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12, as well as to CXCL13, the ligand for CXCR5.
CXCL12 was more abundant in the dark zone, and CXCR4 was more abundant
on centroblasts than centrocytes. In contrast, CXCR5 helped direct cells
to the CXCL13-positive light zone, but was not essential for segregation
of the 2 zones. CXCL13 and CXCR5 were required for correct positioning
of the light zone. Allen et al. (2004) concluded that these chemokines
and their receptors are critical for movement of cells to different
parts of the GC and for creating the distinct histologic appearance of
the GC.

Using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, Cagigi et al. (2008)
found that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see
609423)-seropositive patients, particularly those with low CD4
(186940)-positive T-cell counts, had reduced expression of CXCR5 on B
cells, whereas expression of its ligand, CXCL13, was increased. CXCL13
was secreted upon B-cell activation. CXCL13-positive B cells were
present in lymph nodes of HIV-1-seropositive patients, but not in
control tissue. Cagigi et al. (2008) concluded that altered expression
of CXCR5 and CXCL13 may be involved in B-cell dysfunction during HIV-1
infection.

ANIMAL MODEL

Forster et al. (1996) described the phenotype of gene-targeted mice
lacking the putative chemokine receptor Blr1. In normal mice, this
receptor is expressed on mature B cells and a subpopulation of T helper
cells. Blr1-mutant mice lack inguinal lymph nodes and possess no or only
a few phenotypically abnormal Peyer patches. The migration of
lymphocytes into splenic follicles was severely impaired, resulting in
morphologically altered primary lymphoid follicles. Furthermore,
activated B cells failed to migrate from the T cell-rich zone into
B-cell follicles of the spleen, and despite high numbers of germinal
center founder cells, no functional germinal centers developed in this
organ. These results identified BLR1 as the first G protein-coupled
receptor involved in B cell migration and localization of these cells
within specific anatomic compartments.

CXCR5 was known to be required for B cell migration to splenic
follicles, but the requirements for homing to B-cell areas and lymph
nodes remained to be defined. Ansel et al. (2000) demonstrated that
lymph nodes contain 2 types of B cell-rich compartment: follicles
containing follicular dendritic cells, and areas lacking such cells.
Ansel et al. (2000) generated mice deficient in the B-lymphocyte
chemoattractant (BLC; 605149), for which CXCR5 is the receptor, by
targeted disruption. BLC-deficient mice were similar in appearance to
mice deficient in CXCR5. However, CXCR5-deficient mice have less severe
deficiency in Peyer patches. Using BLC-deficient mice, Ansel et al.
(2000) established that BLC and CXCR5 are needed for B-cell homing to
follicles in lymph nodes as well as in spleen. They also found that BLC
is required for the development of most lymph nodes and Peyer patches.
In addition to mediating chemoattraction, BLC induces B cells to
upregulate membrane lymphotoxin alpha-1-beta-2 (see 600978), a cytokine
that promotes follicular dendritic cell development and BLC expression,
establishing a positive feedback loop thought to be important in
follicle development and homeostasis. In germinal centers, the feedback
loop is overridden, with B cell lymphotoxin alpha-1-beta-2 expression
being induced by a mechanism independent of BLC.

Voigt et al. (2000) found that B cells and dendritic cells do
colocalize, albeit aberrantly, even in the absence of CXCR5. In mice
lacking Cxcr5, both cell types were found in a broad ring around the
sinuses of the marginal zones. Voigt et al. (2000) concluded that in
Cxcr5-deficient mice, the organization of splenic primary follicles is
severely impaired. However, within the T cell zone a microenvironment is
built up, which provides all requirements needed for the affinity
maturation to take place.

Prinz et al. (2003) found that in mice deficient in Cxcr5 the follicular
dendritic cells (FDCs) are juxtaposed to major splenic nerves and the
transfer of intraperitoneally-administered prions (see 176640) into the
spinal cord is accelerated. Neuroinvasion velocity correlated
exclusively with the relative locations of FDCs and nerves; transfer of
Cxcr5 -/- bone marrow to wildtype mice induced perineural FDCs and
enhanced neuroinvasion, whereas reciprocal transfer to Cxcr5 -/- mice
abolished them and restored normal efficiency of neuroinvasion.
Suppression of lymphotoxin signaling depleted FDCs, abolished splenic
infectivity, and suppressed acceleration of pathogenesis in Cxcr5 -/-
mice. Prinz et al. (2003) concluded that their data suggests that prion
neuroimmune transition occurs between FDCs and sympathetic nerves, and
relative positioning of FDCs and nerves controls the efficiency of
peripheral prion infection.

603436	TITLE *603436 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 205; ZNF205
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 210; ZNF210
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The largest family of zinc finger proteins is the C2H2, or Kruppel,
type. See 165220. Some members of the Kruppel family contain a conserved
KRAB region that can be divided into 2 subregions, the A box and the B
box. See 601742. While constructing a transcript map of the critical
region of familial Mediterranean fever (see MEFV; 608107), Deng et al.
(1998) isolated cDNAs encoding ZNF205, which they designated ZNF210.
Sequence analysis indicated that the predicted 504-amino acid protein is
a Kruppel-type zinc finger protein that contains a KRAB A box N-terminal
to 8 zinc finger motifs. Northern blot analysis revealed that the 2.2-kb
ZNF210 mRNA was expressed in all tissues tested. An additional
transcript was detected in a number of tissues.

MAPPING

By analysis of clones from the MEFV region, Deng et al. (1998)
determined that the ZNF205 gene is located approximately 120 kb from the
MEFV gene on 16p13.3. They reported that 4 other zinc finger genes are
located in the MEFV region, including ZNF200 (603231), ZNF174, and
FPM315.

613568	TITLE *613568 ZINC FINGER, MYM-TYPE 4; ZMYM4
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 262; ZNF262;;
KIAA0425
CELL DEATH-INHIBITING RNA, INCLUDED; CDIR, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1997) cloned ZNF262, which they designated
KIAA0425. The deduced protein contains 1,224 amino acids. RT-PCR
detected variable ZNF262 expression in all tissues examined, with
highest expression in kidney and lowest expression in spleen.

By searching an EST database for sequences encoding zinc finger-like
proteins, Smedley et al. (1999) identified ZNF262. The deduced protein
contains 5 tandem myeloproliferative and mental retardation (MYM)
motifs, conserved motifs that closely resemble zinc-binding sequences.
Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of several ZNF262
transcripts in all tissues examined, with highest expression in heart,
skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver.

By screening for cDNAs that inhibited interferon-gamma (147570)-induced
cell death in HeLa cells, Shchors et al. (2002) obtained a
441-nucleotide ZNF262 splice variant that they called CDIR. CDIR
contains only nucleotides 4,416 through 4,856 from the 3-prime UTR of
the full-length 6,108-nucleotide ZNF262 transcript. CDIR has a short ORF
encoding a putative 70-amino acid peptide and 14 stretches of 3 or more
consecutive U nucleobases characteristic of a U- or AU-rich element.

GENE FUNCTION

Shchors et al. (2002) showed that expression of CDIR in HeLa cells
inhibited interferon-gamma-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner.
Domain analysis revealed that only full-length CDIR, and not its
isolated 3-prime or 5-prime ends or ORF, confers resistance to cell
killing. Mutation analysis revealed that the U-rich motifs AUUUUC and
UUUCAUUUU are required for this protection. Resistance to cell killing
was accompanied by elevated levels of p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) and BCL2
(151430) mRNA and protein. In vitro RNA-protein binding assays and
Western blot analysis revealed that HSP27 (HSPB1; 602195) and all
isoforms of AUF1 (HNRNPD; 601324) are components of a protein complex
that binds CDIR. Use of recombinant proteins revealed that AUF1, but not
HSP27, directly bound CDIR. Transfection of HeLa cells with another AUF1
target, the 3-prime UTR of MYC (190080), also inhibited
interferon-gamma-induced cell killing, but in a limited manner. Shchors
et al. (2002) concluded that the antiapoptotic effect of CDIR is due to
the sequestration of AUF1 by CDIR, resulting in elevated levels and
activity of p21 and BCL2.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization and genomic sequence analysis,
Smedley et al. (1999) and Sohal et al. (1999) independently mapped the
ZNF262 gene to chromosome 1p34-p32.

;;LAMIN A;;
LAMIN C; LMNC
PRELAMIN A, INCLUDED;;
PROGERIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The LMNA gene encodes lamin A and lamin C. Lamins are structural protein
components of the nuclear lamina, a protein network underlying the inner
nuclear membrane that determines nuclear shape and size. The lamins
constitute a class of intermediate filaments. Three types of lamins, A,
B (see LMNB1; 150340), and C, have been described in mammalian cells
(Fisher et al., 1986).

CLONING

By screening human fibroblast and hepatoma cDNA libraries, Fisher et al.
(1986) isolated cDNAs corresponding to lamin A and lamin C. The lamin A
and C proteins are predicted to have molecular masses of 74 kD and 65
kD, respectively. Fisher et al. (1986) and McKeon et al. (1986) found
that the deduced amino acid sequences from cDNA clones of human lamin A
and C are identical for the first 566 amino acids, but that lamin A
contains an extra 98 amino acids (corresponding to approximately 9 kD)
at the C terminus. Lamin C has 6 unique C-terminal amino acids. Both
lamins A and C contain a 360-residue alpha-helical domain with homology
to a corresponding alpha-helical rod domain that is the structural
hallmark of all intermediate filament proteins. Fisher et al. (1986) and
McKeon et al. (1986) concluded that lamin A and lamin C arise by
alternative splicing from the same gene.

Guilly et al. (1987) detected a 3-kb lamin A mRNA and a 2.1-kb lamin C
mRNA in epithelial HeLa cells, but not in T lymphoblasts. Lamin B was
the only lamin present in T lymphoblasts. Guilly et al. (1987) noted
that the transport of newly synthesized proteins from the cytoplasm into
the nucleus differs from the transport of proteins into other
organelles, such as mitochondria, in that sequences are not cleaved and
remain a permanent feature of the mature polypeptide. Lamin A appears to
be an exception to this rule.

Weber et al. (1989) showed that lamin A is synthesized as a precursor
molecule called prelamin A. Maturation of lamin A involves the removal
of 18 residues from the C terminus, which is accomplished by
isoprenylation and farnesylation involving a C-terminal CAAX
(cysteine-aliphatic-aliphatic-any amino acid) box (Sinensky et al.,
1994).

GENE STRUCTURE

Lin and Worman (1993) demonstrated that the coding region of the lamin
A/C gene spans approximately 24 kb and contains 12 exons. Alternative
splicing within exon 10 gives rise to 2 different mRNAs that code for
prelamin A and lamin C.

MAPPING

Wydner et al. (1996) mapped the LMNA gene to chromosome 1q21.2-q21.3 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Gross (2013) mapped the LMNA gene to chromosome 1q22 based on an
alignment of the LMNA sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY847595) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Lloyd et al. (2002) identified proteins interacting with the C-terminal
domain of lamin A by screening a mouse 3T3-L1 adipocyte library in a
yeast 2-hybrid interaction screen. Using this approach, the adipocyte
differentiation factor SREBP1 (184756) was identified as a novel lamin A
interactor. In vitro glutathione S-transferase pull-down and in vivo
coimmunoprecipitation studies confirmed an interaction between lamin A
and both SREBP1a and 1c. A binding site for lamin A was identified in
the N-terminal transcription factor domain of SREBP1, between residues
227 and 487. The binding of lamin A to SREBP1 was noticeably reduced by
FPLD mutations. The authors speculated that fat loss seen in
laminopathies may be caused in part by reduced binding of the adipocyte
differentiation factor SREBP1 to lamin A.

Favreau et al. (2004) analyzed myoblast-to-myotube differentiation in a
mouse myogenic cell line overexpressing wildtype or mutant human lamin
A. In contrast to clones overexpressing wildtype lamin A, those
expressing lamin A with the R453W mutation (150330.0002) differentiated
poorly or not at all, did not exit the cell cycle properly, and were
extensively committed to apoptosis. Clones expressing the R482W mutation
(150330.0011) differentiated normally. Favreau et al. (2004) concluded
that lamin A mutated at arginine-453 fails to build a functional
scaffold and/or fails to maintain the chromatin compartmentation
required for differentiation of myoblasts into myocytes.

Using a novel technique to measure nuclear deformation in response to
biaxial strain applied to cells, Lammerding et al. (2004) found that
Lmna -/- cells showed increased nuclear deformation, defective
mechanotransduction, and impaired viability under mechanical strain
compared to wildtype cells. In addition, activity of nuclear
factor-kappa-B (NFKB; 164011), a mechanical stress-responsive
transcription factor that can act as an antiapoptotic signal, was
impaired in the Lmna -/- cells. The findings suggested that lamin A/C
deficiency is associated with both defective nuclear mechanics and
impaired transcriptional activation.

Broers et al. (2004) used a cell compression device to compare wildtype
and Lmna-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and found that Lmna-null
cells showed significantly decreased mechanical stiffness and
significantly lower bursting force. Partial rescue of the phenotype by
transfection with either lamin A or lamin C prevented gross nuclear
disruption, but was unable to fully restore mechanical stiffness.
Confocal microscopy revealed that the nuclei of Lmna-null cells
exhibited an isotropic deformation upon indentation, despite an
anisotropic deformation of the cell as a whole. This nuclear behavior
suggested a loss of interaction of the disturbed nucleus with the
surrounding cytoskeleton. Actin-(102610), vimentin-(193060), and
tubulin-(191110) based filaments showed disturbed interaction in
Lmna-null cells. Broers et al. (2004) suggested that in addition to the
loss of nuclear stiffness, the loss of a physical interaction between
nuclear structures (i.e., lamins) and the cytoskeleton may cause more
general cellular weakness; they proposed a potential key function for
lamins in maintaining cellular tensegrity.

Van Berlo et al. (2005) showed that A-type lamins were essential for the
inhibition of fibroblast proliferation by TGF-beta-1 (190180).
TGF-beta-1 dephosphorylated RB1 (614041) through protein phosphatase 2A
(PPP2CA; 176915), both of which were associated with lamin A/C. In
addition, lamin A/C modulated the effect of TGF-beta-1 on collagen
production, a marker of mesenchymal differentiation. Van Berlo et al.
(2005) proposed a role for lamin A/C in control of gene activity
downstream of TGF-beta-1, via nuclear phosphatases such as PPP2CA.

Capanni et al. (2005) showed that the lamin A precursor was specifically
accumulated in lipodystrophy cells. Pre-lamin A was located at the
nuclear envelope and colocalized with SREBP1 Binding of SREBP1 to the
lamin A precursor was detected in patient fibroblasts, as well as in
control fibroblasts, forced to accumulate pre-lamin A by farnesylation
inhibitors. In contrast, SREBP1 did not interact in vivo with mature
lamin A or C in cultured fibroblasts. Inhibition of lamin A precursor
processing in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes resulted in sequestration of SREBP1
at the nuclear rim, thus decreasing the pool of active SREBP1 that
normally activates PPAR-gamma (601487) and causing impairment of
preadipocyte differentiation. This defect could be rescued by treatment
with troglitazone, a known PPAR-gamma ligand activating the adipogenic
program.

Scaffidi and Misteli (2006) showed that the same molecular mechanism
responsible for Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS; 176670) is
active in healthy cells. Cell nuclei from old individuals acquire
defects similar to those of HGPS patient cells, including changes in
histone modifications and increased DNA damage. Age-related nuclear
defects are caused by sporadic use, in healthy individuals, of the same
cryptic splice site in lamin A whose constitutive activation causes
HGPS. Inhibition of this splice site reverses the nuclear defects
associated with aging. Scaffidi and Misteli (2006) concluded that their
observations implicate lamin A in physiologic aging.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see 609423) protease inhibitors
(PIs) targeting the viral aspartyl protease are a cornerstone of
treatment for HIV infection and disease, but they are associated with
lipodystrophy and other side effects. Coffinier et al. (2007) found that
treatment of human and mouse fibroblasts with HIV-PIs caused an
accumulation of prelamin A. The prelamin A in HIV-PI-treated fibroblasts
migrated more rapidly than nonfarnesylated prelamin A, comigrating with
the farnesylated form found in ZMPSTE24 (606480)-deficient fibroblasts.
HIV-PI-treated heterozygous ZMPSTE24 fibroblasts exhibited an
exaggerated accumulation of farnesyl-prelamin A. Western blot and
enzymatic analysis showed that HIV-PIs inhibited ZMPSTE24 activity and
endoproteolytic processing of a GFP-prelamin A fusion protein, but they
did not affect farnesylation of HDJ2 (DNAJA1; 602837) or activity of
farnesyltransferase (see 134635), ICMT (605851), and RCE1 (605385) in
vitro. Coffinier et al. (2007) concluded that HIV-PIs inhibit ZMPSTE24,
leading to an accumulation of farnesyl-prelamin A, possibly explaining
HIV-PI side effects.

The nuclear envelope LINC (links the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton)
complex, which is formed by SUN (e.g., SUN1, 607723) and nesprin (e.g.,
SYNE1, 608441) proteins, provides a direct connection between the
nuclear lamina and the cytoskeleton. Haque et al. (2010) stated that
SUN1 and SUN2 interact with LMNA and that LMNA is required for the
nuclear envelope localization of SUN2, but not SUN1. They found that
LMNA mutations associated with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD2;
181350) and HGPS disrupted interaction of LMNA with mouse Sun1 and human
SUN2. Nuclear localization of SUN1 and SUN2 was not impaired in EDMD2 or
HGPS cell lines. Expression of SUN1, but not SUN2, at the nuclear
envelope was enhanced in some HGPS cells, likely due to increased
interaction of SUN1 with accumulated prelamin A. Haque et al. (2010)
proposed that different perturbations in LMNA-SUN protein interactions
may underlie the opposing effects of EDMD and HGPS mutations on nuclear
and cellular mechanics.

Liu et al. (2011) reported the generation of induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs) from fibroblasts obtained from patients with HGPS. HGPS
iPSCs showed absence of progerin, and more importantly, lacked the
nuclear envelope and epigenetic alterations normally associated with
premature aging. Upon differentiation of HGPS iPSCs, progerin and its
aging-associated phenotypic consequences were restored. Specifically,
directed differentiation of HGPS iPSCs to vascular smooth muscle cells
led to the appearance of premature senescence phenotypes associated with
vascular aging. Additionally, their studies identified DNA-dependent
protein kinase catalytic subunit (PRKDC; 600899) as a downstream target
of progerin. The absence of nuclear PRKDC holoenzyme correlated with
premature as well as physiologic aging. Because progerin also
accumulates during physiologic aging, Liu et al. (2011) argued that
their results provided an in vitro iPSC-based model to study the
pathogenesis of human premature and physiologic vascular aging.

Chen et al. (2012) showed that cells from Lmna -/- mice, which represent
EDMD2, cells from Lmna(L530P/L530P) mice, which represent HGPS, and
cells from HGPS patients all had overaccumulation of the inner nuclear
envelope SUN1 protein. In wildtype cells, Lmna and Sun1 colocalized at
the nuclear envelope. In Lmna -/- cells, larger amounts of Sun1 were
found at the nuclear envelope and also in the Golgi. The larger amounts
of Sun1 appeared to result from reduced protein turnover. Transfection
of increasing amounts of mouse Sun1 into Lmna-null/Sun1-null murine
cells resulted in increased prevalence of nuclear herniations and
apoptosis, and the herniations appeared to result from Sun1 accumulation
in the Golgi. Loss of the Sun1 gene in both mouse models extensively
rescued cellular, tissue, organ, and lifespan abnormalities. Similarly,
knockdown of overaccumulated SUN1 protein in primary human HGPS cells
corrected nuclear defects and cellular senescence. The findings
indicated that accumulation of SUN1 is a common pathogenetic event in
these disorders.

In mice, Ho et al. (2013) found that lamin A/C-deficient (Lmna-null) and
Lmna(N195K/N195K) (see 150330.0007) mutant cells have impaired nuclear
translocation and downstream signaling of the mechanosensitive
transcription factor megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (MKL1; 606078), a
myocardin family member that is pivotal in cardiac development and
function. Altered nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of MKL1 was caused by
altered actin dynamics in Lmna-null and Lmna(N195K/N195K) mutant cells.
Ectopic expression of the nuclear envelope protein emerin (300384),
which is mislocalized in Lmna mutant cells and also linked to
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (310300) and dilated cardiomyopathy,
restored MKL1 nuclear translocation and rescued actin dynamics in mutant
cells. Ho et al. (2013) concluded that their findings presented a novel
mechanism that could provide insight into the disease etiology for the
cardiac phenotype in many laminopathies, whereby lamin A/C and emerin
regulate gene expression through modulation of nuclear and cytoskeletal
actin polymerization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mutations in the LMNA gene cause a wide range of human diseases. Since
more than 10 different clinical syndromes have been attributed to LMNA
mutations, many of which show overlapping features, attempts at broad
classification have been proposed. Worman and Bonne (2007) suggested
that the disorders may be classified into 4 major types: diseases of
striated and cardiac muscle; lipodystrophy syndromes; peripheral
neuropathy; and premature aging. Benedetti et al. (2007) suggested 2
main groups: (1) neuromuscular and cardiac disorders, and (2)
lipodystrophy and premature aging disorders. The phenotypic
heterogeneity of diseases resulting from a mutation in a single gene can
be explained by the numerous roles of the nuclear lamina, including
maintenance of nuclear shape and structure, as well as functional roles
in transcriptional regulation and heterochromatin organization (review
by Capell and Collins, 2006).

Genschel and Schmidt (2000) compiled a list of 41 known mutations,
predominantly missense, in the LMNA gene. Twenty-three different
mutations had been shown to cause autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss
muscular dystrophy (EDMD2; 181350). Three mutations had been reported to
cause autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD1B;
159001), 8 mutations were known to result in dilated cardiomyopathy
(CMD1A; 115200), and 7 mutations were reported to cause familial partial
lipodystrophy (FPLD2; 151660). In addition, 1 mutation in LMNA (H222Y;
150330.0014) appeared to be responsible for an autosomal recessive,
atypical form of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD3; see 181350).

- Muscular Dystrophies

In 5 families with autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
(EDMD2; 181350), Bonne et al. (1999) identified 4 mutations in the LMNA
gene (150330.0001-150330.0004) that cosegregated with the disease
phenotype. These findings represented the first identification of
mutations in a component of the nuclear lamina as a cause of an
inherited muscle disorder. The authors noted that lamins interact with
integral proteins of the inner nuclear membrane, including emerin
(300384), which is mutated in the X-linked form of Emery-Dreifuss
muscular dystrophy (EDMD1; 310300).

Raffaele di Barletta et al. (2000) showed that heterozygous mutations in
LMNA may cause diverse phenotypes ranging from typical EDMD to no
phenotypic effect. LMNA mutations in patients with autosomal dominant
EDMD occur in the tail and in the 2A rod domain of the protein,
suggesting that unique interactions between lamin A/C and other nuclear
components have an important role in cardiac and skeletal muscle
function. They identified a homozygous LMNA mutation (H222Y;
150330.0014) in 1 patient born of consanguineous unaffected parents,
consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance and a severe atypical
phenotype lacking cardiac features.

Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (LGMD1B; 159001) is an autosomal
dominant, slowly progressive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy with
age-related atrioventricular cardiac conduction disturbances and the
absence of early contractures. Muchir et al. (2000) found mutations in
the LMNA gene in 3 LGMD1B families: a missense mutation (150330.0017), a
deletion of a codon (150330.0018), and a splice donor site mutation
(150330.0019). The 3 mutations were identified in all affected members
of the corresponding families and were absent in 100 unrelated control
subjects.

Quijano-Roy et al. (2008) described a form of congenital muscular
dystrophy (MDC) with onset in the first year of life in 15 children
resulting from de novo heterozygous mutations in the LMNA gene (see,
e.g., 150330.0047-150330.0049). Three patients had severe early-onset
disease, with decreased fetal movements in utero, no motor development,
severe hypotonia, diffuse limb and axial muscle weakness and atrophy,
and talipes foot deformities. The remaining 12 children initially
acquired head and trunk control and independent ambulation, but most
lost head control due to neck extensor weakness, a phenotype consistent
with 'dropped head syndrome.' Ten children required ventilatory support.
Cardiac arrhythmias were observed in 4 of the oldest patients, but were
symptomatic only in 1. Quijano-Roy et al. (2008) concluded that the
identified LMNA mutations appeared to correlate with a relatively severe
phenotype, broadening the spectrum of laminopathies. The authors
suggested that this group of patients may define a new disease entity,
which they designated LMNA-related congenital muscular dystrophy
(613205).

Benedetti et al. (2007) reported 27 individuals with mutations in the
LMNA gene resulting in a wide range of neuromuscular disorders.
Phenotypic analysis yielded 2 broad groups of patients. One group
included patients with childhood onset who had skeletal muscle
involvement with predominant scapuloperoneal and facial weakness,
consistent with EDMD or congenital muscular dystrophy. The second group
included patients with later or adult onset who had cardiac disorders or
a limb-girdle myopathy, consistent with LGMD1B. Those in the group with
early onset tended to have missense mutations, whereas those in the
group with adult onset tended to have truncating mutations. Analysis of
the variants showed that those associated with early-onset phenotypes
were primarily found in the Ig-like domain and in coil 2A, which may
interfere with binding to specific ligands. Those associated with later
onset were mostly located in the rod domain and in coil 2B, which was
predicted to affect the surface of lamin A/C dimers and lead to impaired
filament assembly. Benedetti et al. (2007) speculated that there may be
2 different pathogenetic mechanisms associated with neuromuscular
LMNA-related disorders: late-onset phenotypes may arise through loss of
LMNA function secondary to haploinsufficiency, whereas dominant-negative
or toxic gain-of-function mechanisms may underlie the more severe early
phenotypes.

- Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Cardiac Conduction Defects

Fatkin et al. (1999) studied the LMNA gene in 11 families with autosomal
dominant dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction system disease (CMD1A;
115200) linked to a region on chromosome 1 overlapping that of the LMNA
gene. They identified 5 novel missense mutations
(150330.0004-150330.0009): 4 in the alpha-helical rod domain of lamin A,
and 1 in the tail domain of lamin C. No family members with mutations
had joint contractures or skeletal myopathy characteristic of autosomal
dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Furthermore, serum creatine
kinase levels were normal in family members with mutations of the lamin
A rod domain, but mildly elevated in some family members with a defect
in the lamin C tail domain. The authors noted that mutations in the rod
domain of the protein led to dilated cardiomyopathy, whereas mutations
in the head or tail domain caused Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.

Van der Kooi et al. (2002) reported a sporadic patient and 2 unrelated
families with mutations in the LMNA gene who presented with varying
degrees and combinations of muscular dystrophy, partial lipodystrophy,
and cardiomyopathy with conduction defects, presumably due to single
mutations (see 150330.0003 and 150330.0005).

Sebillon et al. (2003) screened the coding sequence of LMNA in DNA
samples from 66 index cases of dilated cardiomyopathy with or without
associated features. They identified a glu161-to-lys mutation (E161K;
150330.0028) in a family with early-onset atrial fibrillation preceding
or coexisting with dilated cardiomyopathy, the previously described
R377H mutation (150330.0017) in the family with quadriceps myopathy
associated with dilated cardiomyopathy previously reported by Charniot
et al. (2003), and a 28insA mutation (150330.0029) leading to a
premature stop codon in a third family with dilated cardiomyopathy with
conduction defects. No mutation in LMNA was found in cases with isolated
dilated cardiomyopathy.

Meune et al. (2006) investigated the efficacy of implantable
cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in the primary prevention of sudden
death in patients with cardiomyopathy due to lamin A/C gene mutations.
Patients referred for permanent cardiac pacing were systematically
offered the implantation of an ICD. The patients were enrolled solely on
the basis of the presence of lamin A/C mutations associated with cardiac
conduction defects. Indications for pacemaker implantation were
progressive conduction block and sinus block. In all, 19 patients were
treated. Meune et al. (2006) concluded that ICD implantation in patients
with lamin A/C mutations who are in need of a pacemaker is effective in
treating possibly lethal tachyarrhythmias, and that implantation of an
ICD, rather than a pacemaker, should be considered for such patients.

Taylor et al. (2003) screened the LMNA gene in 40 families and 9
sporadic patients with CMD with or without muscular dystrophy and
identified mutations in 3 families (see, e.g., 150330.0017) and 1
sporadic patient (S573L; 150330.0041). All mutations involved a
conserved residue, cosegregated with the disease within the families,
and were not found in 300 control chromosomes. LMNA mutation carriers
had a severe and progressive form of CMD with significantly poorer
cumulative survival compared to noncarrier CMD patients.

- Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Hypergonadotropic Hypogonadism

In a 17-year-old Caucasian female with premature ovarian failure and
dilated cardiomyopathy, who had features consistent with atypical Werner
syndrome (see 277700) but who was negative for mutation in the RECQL2
gene (604611), Nguyen et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a
missense mutation in the LMNA gene (L59R; 150330.0052). The authors
suggested the diagnosis of a laminopathy, most likely an atypical form
of mandibuloacral dysplasia (see 248370).

In a 15-year-old Caucasian girl with premature ovarian failure and
dilated cardiomyopathy, McPherson et al. (2009) identified
heterozygosity for the L59R mutation in the LMNA gene. McPherson et al.
(2009) noted phenotypic similarities between this patient and the
patient previously reported by Nguyen et al. (2007), who carried the
same mutation, as well as a patient originally described by Chen et al.
(2003) with an adjacent A57P mutation in LMNA (150330.0030). Features
common to these 3 patients included premature ovarian failure, dilated
cardiomyopathy, lipodystrophy, and progressive facial and skeletal
changes involving micrognathia and sloping shoulders, but not
acroosteolysis. Although the appearance of these patients was somewhat
progeroid, none had severe growth failure, alopecia, or rapidly
progressive atherosclerosis, and McPherson et al. (2009) suggested that
the phenotype represents a distinct laminopathy involving dilated
cardiomyopathy and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (212112).

- Lipodystrophy Disorders

Patients with Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy, or partial
lipodystrophy type 2 (FPLD2; 151660), are born with normal fat
distribution, but after puberty experience regional and progressive
adipocyte degeneration, often associated with profound insulin
resistance and diabetes. Cao and Hegele (2000) hypothesized that the
analogy between the regional muscle wasting in autosomal dominant
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and the regional adipocyte
degeneration in FPLD, in addition to the chromosomal localization of the
FPLD2 locus on 1q21-q22, made LMNA a good candidate gene for FPLD2.
Studies of 5 Canadian probands with familial partial lipodystrophy of
Dunnigan type indicated that each had a novel missense mutation (R482Q;
150330.0010) that cosegregated with the lipodystrophy phenotype and was
absent from 2,000 normal alleles.

Shackleton et al. (2000) identified 5 different missense mutations in
the LMNA gene (see, e.g., 150330.0010-150330.0012) among 10 kindreds and
3 individuals with partial lipodystrophy. All of the mutations occurred
in exon 8, which the authors noted is within the C-terminal globular
domain of lamin A/C. Flier (2000) commented on the significance of LMNA
mutations in partial lipodystrophy.

Vantyghem et al. (2004) characterized the neuromuscular and cardiac
phenotypes of FPLD patients bearing the heterozygous R482W mutation.
Fourteen patients from 2 unrelated families, including 10 affected
subjects, were studied. Clinical and histologic examination showed an
incapacitating, progressive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy in a
42-year-old woman that had been present since childhood, associated with
a typical postpubertal FPLD phenotype. Six of 8 adults presented the
association of calf hypertrophy, perihumeral muscular atrophy, and a
rolling gait due to proximal lower limb weakness. Muscular histology was
compatible with muscular dystrophy in one of them and/or showed a
nonspecific excess of lipid droplets (in 3 cases). Cardiac septal
hypertrophy and atherosclerosis were frequent in FPLD patients. In
addition, a 24-year-old FPLD patient had a symptomatic second-degree
atrioventricular block. Vantyghem et al. (2004) concluded that most
lipodystrophic patients affected by the FPLD-linked R482W mutation show
muscular and cardiac abnormalities.

Mandibuloacral dysplasia (see 248370) is a rare autosomal recessive
disorder characterized by postnatal growth retardation, craniofacial
anomalies, skeletal malformations, and mottled cutaneous pigmentation.
Patients with MAD frequently have partial lipodystrophy and insulin
resistance, which are features seen in FPLD. In all affected members of
5 consanguineous Italian families with MAD, Novelli et al. (2002)
identified a homozygous missense mutation (R527H; 150330.0021) in the
LMNA gene. Patient skin fibroblasts showed nuclei that presented
abnormal lamin A/C distribution and a dysmorphic envelope, demonstrating
the pathogenic effect of the mutation.

In affected members of a consanguineous family from north India,
Plasilova et al. (2004) identified a homozygous missense mutation in the
LMNA gene (150330.0033). The extent of skeletal lesions in this family
were consistent with MAD, but affected individuals also had classic
features of progeria. Plasilova et al. (2004) suggested that autosomal
recessive HGPS and mandibuloacral dysplasia may represent a single
disorder with varying degrees of disease severity.

Decaudain et al. (2007) identified changes in codon 482 of the LMNA gene
(see, e.g., R482Q 150330.0010 and R482W; 150330.0011) in 17 of 277
unrelated adults investigated for lipodystrophy and/or insulin
resistance. All 17 had classic features of FPLD2. Ten additional
patients who fulfilled the International Diabetes Federation diagnostic
criteria for metabolic syndrome were found to have heterozygous LMNA
mutations that were not in codon 482, but affected all 3 domains of the
protein, the N terminal, central rod domain, and C terminal globulin
domain (see, e.g., R399C; 150330.0043). Because the phenotype of these
patients was not typical of FPLD2, the diagnosis of laminopathy was
delayed. Although lipodystrophy was less severe than in typical FPLD2,
common features included calf hypertrophy, myalgia, and muscle cramps or
weakness. Two patients had cardiac conduction disturbances. Metabolic
alterations were prominent, especially insulin resistance and
hypertriglyceridemia.

- Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2B1

In affected members of inbred Algerian families with an axonal form of
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease linked to chromosome 1q21.2-q21.3 (CMT2B1;
605588), De Sandre-Giovannoli et al. (2002) found a shared common
homozygous ancestral haplotype that was suggestive of a founder mutation
and identified a unique mutation in the LMNA rod domain (R298C;
150330.0020). Ultrastructural studies of sciatic nerves of Lmna-null
mice showed a strong reduction of axon density, axonal enlargement, and
the presence of nonmyelinated axons, all of which were highly similar to
the phenotypes of human peripheral axonopathies.

- Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome and Other Premature
Aging Syndromes

Eriksson et al. (2003) identified de novo heterozygous point mutations
in lamin A that cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS;
176670). Eighteen of 20 classic cases of HGPS harbored the identical de
novo single-base substitution resulting in a silent gly-to-gly change at
codon 608 within exon 11 (150330.0022). This change creates an exonic
consensus splice site and activates cryptic splicing, leading to
deletion of 50 codons at the end of prelamin A. This prelamin A still
retains the CAAX box but lacks the site for endoproteolytic cleavage.
Eriksson et al. (2003) suggested that there is at least 1 site for
phosphorylation, ser625, that is deleted in the abnormal lamin A
protein. De Sandre-Giovannoli et al. (2003) independently identified the
heterozygous exon 11 cryptic splice site activation mutation
(1824C-T+1819-1968del; 150330.0022) in 2 HGPS patients. Later cellular
studies (Capell et al., 2005; Glynn and Glover, 2005; Toth et al., 2005)
indicated that Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome results from the
production of a truncated prelamin A, called progerin, which is
farnesylated at its C terminus and accumulates at the nuclear envelope,
causing misshapen nuclei (Yang et al., 2006).

Werner syndrome (277700) is an autosomal recessive progeroid syndrome
caused by mutation in the RECQL2 gene (WRN; 604611). Chen et al. (2003)
reported that of 129 index patients referred to their international
registry for molecular diagnosis of Werner syndrome, 26 (20%) had
wildtype RECQL2 coding regions and were categorized as having 'atypical
Werner syndrome' or 'non-WRN' on the basis of molecular criteria.
Because of some phenotypic similarities between Werner syndrome and
laminopathies including Hutchinson-Gilford progeria, Chen et al. (2003)
sequenced all exons of the LMNA gene in these 26 individuals and found
heterozygosity for novel missense mutations in LMNA in 4 (15%): A57P
(150330.0030), R133L (150330.0027) in 2 persons, and L140R
(150330.0031). Hegele (2003) stated that the clinical designation of
Werner syndrome for each of the 4 patients of Chen et al. (2003), in
whom mutations in the LMNA gene were found, appeared somewhat insecure.
He noted that the comparatively young ages of onset in the patients with
mutant LMNA would be just as consistent with late-onset
Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome as with early-onset Werner syndrome.
Patients with so-called atypical Werner syndrome and mutant LMNA also
expressed components of nonprogeroid laminopathies. Hegele (2003)
suggested that genomic DNA analysis can help draw a diagnostic line that
clarifies potential overlap between older patients with
Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome and younger patients with Werner syndrome,
and that therapies may depend on precise molecular classification.

McPherson et al. (2009) suggested that the patient in whom Chen et al.
(2003) identified an A57P LMNA mutation had a distinct phenotype
involving dilated cardiomyopathy and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism
(212112).

Csoka et al. (2004) screened 13 cell lines from atypical progeroid
patients for mutation in the LMNA gene. They identified 3 novel
heterozygous missense mutations in the LMNA gene in 3 patients: a
13-year-old female with a progeroid syndrome, a 15-year-old male with a
lipodystrophy, and a 20-year-old male with 'atypical progeria.' The
mutations identified in the last 2 patients were the most 5-prime and
3-prime missense mutations, respectively, in LMNA identified to that
time.

Reddel and Weiss (2004) reported that transcription efficiencies of the
mutant and wildtype LMNA alleles were equivalent in HGPS. The mutant
allele gave 2 types of transcripts that encoded truncated and normal
lamin A. Abnormally spliced progerin transcript constituted the majority
(84.5%) of the total steady-state mRNA derived from the mutant allele.
The abnormally spliced progerin transcript was a minority (40%) of all
lamin A transcripts obtained from both alleles. Reddel and Weiss (2004)
concluded that the mutated progerin functions as a dominant negative by
interfering with the structure of the nuclear lamina, intranuclear
architecture, and macromolecular interactions, which collectively would
have a major impact on nuclear function.

Fibroblasts from individuals with HGPS have severe morphologic
abnormalities in nuclear envelope structure. Scaffidi and Misteli (2005)
showed that the cellular disease phenotype is reversible in cells from
individuals with HGPS. Introduction of wildtype lamin A protein did not
rescue the cellular disease manifestations. The mutant LMNA mRNA and
lamin A protein could be efficiently eliminated by correction of the
aberrant splicing event using a modified oligonucleotide targeted to the
activated cryptic splice site. Upon splicing correction, HGPS
fibroblasts assumed normal nuclear morphology, the aberrant nuclear
distribution and cellular levels of lamina-associated proteins were
rescued, defects in heterochromatin-specific histone modifications were
corrected, and proper expression of several misregulated genes was
reestablished. The results established proof of principle for the
correction of the premature aging phenotype in individuals with HGPS.

Huang et al. (2005) designed short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) targeting
mutated pre-spliced or mature LMNA mRNAs and expressed them in HGPS
fibroblasts carrying the 1824C-T mutation (150330.0022). One of the
shRNAs reduced the expression levels of mutant lamin A (so-called LA
delta-50) to 26% or lower. The reduced expression was associated with
amelioration of abnormal nuclear morphology, improvement of
proliferative potential, and reduction in the numbers of senescent
cells.

Moulson et al. (2007) reported 2 unrelated patients with extremely
severe forms of HGPS associated with unusual mutations in the LMNA gene
(150330.0036 and 150330.0040, respectively). Both mutations resulted in
increased use of the cryptic exon 11 donor splice site that is also
observed with the common 1824C-T mutation (150330.0022). As a
consequence, the ratios of mutant progerin mRNA and protein to wildtype
were higher than in typical HGPS patients. The findings indicated that
the level of progerin expression correlates with severity of disease.

Scaffidi and Misteli (2008) found that progerin (150330.0022) expression
in immortalized human skin fibroblasts produced several defects typical
of HGPS. Progerin also caused the spontaneous differentiation of human
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into endothelial cells, and reduced their
differentiation along the adipogenic lineage. Abnormal differentiation
of MSCs appeared to be due to progerin-induced activation of major
downstream effectors of the Notch signaling pathway, including HES1
(139605), HES5 (607348), and HEY1 (602953). Scaffidi and Misteli (2008)
noted that the progerin splice variant of LMNA is present at low levels
in cells from healthy individuals and has been implicated in the normal
aging process. They suggested that progerin-induced defects in Notch
signaling are involved in normal aging and similarly affect adult MSCs
and their differentiation.

- Restrictive Dermopathy

In 2 of 9 fetuses with restrictive dermopathy (275210), a lethal
genodermatosis in which tautness of the skin causes fetal akinesia or
hypokinesia deformation sequence, Navarro et al. (2004) identified
heterozygous splicing mutations in the LMNA gene, resulting in the
complete or partial loss of exon 11 (150330.0036 and 150330.0022,
respectively). In the other 7 patients, they identified a heterozygous
1-bp insertion resulting in a premature stop codon in the zinc
metalloproteinase STE24 gene (ZMPSTE24; 606480). This gene encodes a
metalloproteinase specifically involved in the posttranslational
processing of lamin A precursor. In all patients carrying a ZMPSTE24
mutation, loss of expression of lamin A as well as abnormal patterns of
nuclear sizes and shapes and mislocalization of lamin-associated
proteins was seen. Navarro et al. (2004) concluded that a common
pathogenetic pathway, involving defects of the nuclear lamina and
matrix, is involved in restrictive dermopathy.

Navarro et al. (2005) described 7 previously reported patients and 3 new
patients with restrictive dermopathy who were homozygous or compound
heterozygous for ZMPSTE24 mutations. In all cases there was complete
absence of both ZMPSTE24 and mature lamin A, associated with prelamin A
accumulation. The authors concluded that restrictive dermopathy is
either a primary or a secondary laminopathy, caused by dominant de novo
LMNA mutations or, more frequently, recessive null ZMPSTE24 mutations.
The accumulation of truncated or normal length prelamin A is, therefore,
a shared pathophysiologic feature in recessive and dominant restrictive
dermopathy.

- Heart-Hand Syndrome, Slovenian Type

In a Slovenian family with heart-hand syndrome (610140), originally
reported by Sinkovec et al. (2005), Renou et al. (2008) identified a
splice site mutation in the LMNA gene (150330.0045) that segregated with
disease and was not found in 100 healthy controls. Analysis of
fibroblasts from 2 affected members of the family revealed truncated
lamin A/C protein and nuclear envelope abnormalities, confirming the
pathogenicity of the mutation.

- Other Associations

Hegele et al. (2000) identified a common single-nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) in LMNA, 1908C/T, which was associated with obesity-related traits
in Canadian Oji-Cree. Hegele et al. (2001) reported association of this
LMNA SNP with anthropometric indices in 186 nondiabetic Canadian Inuit.
They found that physical indices of obesity, such as body mass index,
waist circumference, waist-to-hip circumference ratio, subscapular
skinfold thickness, and subscapular-to-triceps skinfold thickness ratio
were each significantly higher among Inuit subjects with the LMNA 1908T
allele than in subjects with the 1908C/1908C genotype. For each
significantly associated obesity-related trait, the LMNA 1908C/T SNP
genotype accounted for approximately 10 to 100% of the attributable
variation. The results indicated that common genetic variation in LMNA
is an important determinant of obesity-related quantitative traits.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

In 14 of 15 families with familial partial lipodystrophy, Speckman et
al. (2000) identified mutations in exon 8 of the LMNA gene: 5 families
had an R482Q mutation (150330.0010); 7 families had an R482W alteration
(150330.0011), and 1 family had a G465D alteration (150330.0015). The
R482Q and R482W mutations occurred on different haplotypes, indicating
that they probably had arisen more than once. One family with an
atypical form of familial partial lipodystrophy had an R582H mutation
(150330.0016) in exon 11 of the LMNA gene, which the authors noted can
affect the lamin A protein only. Speckman et al. (2000) noted that all
mutations in Dunnigan lipodystrophy affect the globular C-terminal
domain of the lamin A/C protein, whereas mutations responsible for
dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction-system disease are usually
clustered in the rod domain of the protein (Fatkin et al., 1999).
Speckman et al. (2000) could not detect mutations in the LMNA gene in 1
FPLD family that showed linkage to 1q21-q23.

Hegele (2005) used hierarchical cluster analysis to assemble 16
laminopathy phenotypes into 2 classes based on organ system involvement,
and then classified 91 reported causative LMNA mutations according to
their position upstream or downstream of the nuclear localization signal
(NLS) sequence. Contingency analysis revealed that laminopathy class and
LMNA mutation position were strongly correlated (p less than 0.0001),
suggesting that laminopathy phenotype and LMNA genotype are nonrandomly
associated.

Lanktree et al. (2007) analyzed the LMNA gene in 3 unrelated patients
with FPLD2 and identified heterozygosity for 3 different missense
mutations, all affecting only the lamin A isoform and each changing a
conserved residue. Two of the mutations, D230N (150330.0042) and R399C
(150330.0043), were 5-prime to the NLS, which is not typical of LMNA
mutations in FPLD2. The third mutation, S573L (150330.0041), had
previously been identified in heterozygosity in a patient with dilated
cardiomyopathy and conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200) and in
homozygosity in a patient with arthropathy, tendinous calcinosis, and
progeroid features (see 248370). None of the mutations were found in 200
controls of multiple ethnicities. Because heterozygosity for an S573L
mutation can cause cardiomyopathy without lipodystrophy or lipodystrophy
without cardiomyopathy, Lanktree et al. (2007) suggested that additional
factors, genetic or environmental, may contribute to the precise tissue
involvement.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mounkes et al. (2003) attempted to create a mouse model for autosomal
dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (181350) by introducing a
L530P (150330.0004) mutation in the LMNA gene. Although mice
heterozygous for L530P did not show signs of muscular dystrophy and
remained overtly normal up to 6 months of age, mice homozygous for the
mutation showed phenotypes markedly reminiscent of symptoms observed in
progeria patients. Homozygous Lmna L530P/L530P mice were
indistinguishable from their littermates at birth, but by 4 to 6 days
developed severe growth retardation, dying within 4 to 5 weeks.
Homozygous mutant mice showed a slight waddling gait, suggesting
immobility of joints. Other progeria features of these mutant mice
included micrognathia and abnormal dentition--in approximately half of
the mutants a gap was observed between the lower 2 incisors, which also
appeared yellowed. Mutant mice also had loss of subcutaneous fat,
reduced numbers of eccrine and sebaceous glands, increased collagen
deposition in skin, and decreased hair follicle density. Mounkes et al.
(2003) concluded that Lmna L530P/L530P mice have significant phenotypic
overlap with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, including nuclear
envelope abnormalities and decreased doublet capacity and life span of
fibroblasts.

Mounkes et al. (2005) generated mice expressing the human N195K
(150330.0007) mutation and observed characteristics consistent with
CMD1A. Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring of cardiac activity
demonstrated that N195K-homozygous mice died at an early age due to
arrhythmia. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis showed that
Hf1b/Sp4 (600540), connexin-40 (GJA5; 121013), and connexin-43 (GJA1;
121014) were misexpressed and/or mislocalized in N195K-homozygous mouse
hearts. Desmin staining revealed a loss of organization at sarcomeres
and intercalated disks. Mounkes et al. (2005) hypothesized that
mutations within the LMNA gene may cause cardiomyopathy by disrupting
the internal organization of the cardiomyocyte and/or altering the
expression of transcription factors essential to normal cardiac
development, aging, or function.

Arimura et al. (2005) created a mouse model of autosomal dominant
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy expressing an H222P mutation in Lmna.
At adulthood, male homozygous mice displayed reduced locomotion activity
with abnormal stiff walking posture, and all died by 9 months of age.
They also developed dilated cardiomyopathy with hypokinesia and
conduction defects. These skeletal and cardiac muscle features were also
observed in the female homozygous mice, but with a later onset than in
males. Histopathologic analysis of the mice revealed muscle degeneration
with fibrosis associated with dislocation of heterochromatin and
activation of Smad signaling in heart and skeletal muscles.

Varga et al. (2006) created transgenic mice carrying the G608G
(150330.0022)-mutated human LMNA gene and observed the development of a
dramatic defect of the large arteries, consisting of progressive medial
vascular smooth muscle cell loss and replacement with proteoglycan and
collagen followed by vascular remodeling with calcification and
adventitial thickening. In vivo, these arterial abnormalities were
reflected by a blunted initial response to the vasodilator sodium
nitroprusside, consistent with impaired vascular relaxation, and
attenuated blood pressure recovery after infusion. Varga et al. (2006)
noted that although G608G transgenic mice lacked the external phenotype
seen in human progeria, they demonstrated a progressive vascular
abnormality that closely resembled the most lethal aspect of the human
phenotype.

Frock et al. (2006) found that most cultured muscle cells from Lmna
knockout mice exhibited impaired differentiation kinetics and reduced
differentiation potential. Similarly, knockdown of Lmna or emerin (EMD;
300384) expression by RNA interference in normal muscle cells impaired
differentiation potential and reduced expression of muscle-specific
genes, Myod (159970) and desmin (125660). To determine whether impaired
myogenesis was linked to reduced Myod or desmin levels, Frock et al.
(2006) individually expressed these proteins in Lmna-null myoblasts and
found that both increased the differentiation potential of mutant
myoblasts. Frock et al. (2006) concluded that LMNA and emerin are
required for myogenic differentiation, at least in part, through an
effect on expression of critical myoblast proteins.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is caused by the production
of a truncated prelamin A, called progerin, which is farnesylated at its
C terminus and accumulates at the nuclear envelope, causing misshapen
nuclei (Yang et al., 2006). Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) have
been shown to reverse this cellular abnormality (Yang et al., 2005; Toth
et al., 2005; Capell et al., 2005; Mallampalli et al., 2005). Yang et
al. (2006) generated mice with a targeted HGPS mutation (Lmna HG/+) and
observed phenotypes similar to those in human HGPS patients, including
retarded growth, reduced amounts of adipose tissue, micrognathia,
osteoporosis, and osteolytic lesions in bone, which caused spontaneous
rib fractures in the mutant mice. Treatment with an FTI increased
adipose tissue mass, improved body weight curves, reduced the number of
rib fractures, and improved bone mineralization and bone cortical
thickness.

Yang et al. (2008) created knockin mice expressing a nonfarnesylatable
form of progerin. Knockin mice developed the same disease phenotype as
mice expressing farnesylated progerin, although the phenotype was
milder, and embryonic fibroblasts derived from these mice contained
fewer misshapen nuclei. The steady-state level of nonfarnesylated
progerin, but not mRNA, was lower in cultured fibroblasts and whole
tissues, suggesting that the absence of farnesylation may accelerate
progerin turnover.

In a mouse model of EDMD carrying an H222P mutation in the Lmna gene
(Arimura et al., 2005), Muchir et al. (2007) found that activation of
MAPK (see 176948) pathways preceded clinical signs or detectable
molecular markers of cardiomyopathy. Expression of H222P-mutant Lmna in
heart tissue and isolated cardiomyocytes resulted in tissue-specific
activation of MAPKs and downstream target genes. The results suggested
that activation of MAPK pathways plays a role in the pathogenesis of
cardiac disease in EDMD.

Muchir et al. (2009) demonstrated abnormal activation of the
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) branch of the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade in hearts of
Lmna H222P knockin mice, a model of autosomal Emery-Dreifuss muscular
dystrophy. Systemic treatment of Lmna H222P/H222P mice that developed
cardiomyopathy with PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK activation, inhibited
ERK phosphorylation and blocked the activation of downstream genes in
heart. It also blocked increased expression of RNAs encoding natriuretic
peptide precursors and proteins involved in sarcomere organization that
occurred in placebo-treated mice. Histologic analysis and
echocardiography demonstrated that treatment with PD98059 delayed the
development of left ventricular dilatation. PD98059-treated Lmna
H222P/H222P mice had normal cardiac ejection fractions assessed by
echocardiography, whereas placebo-treated mice had a 30% decrease. The
authors emphasized the role of ERK activation in the development of
cardiomyopathy caused by LMNA mutations, and provided further proof of
principle for ERK inhibition as a therapeutic option to prevent or delay
heart failure in humans with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and
related disorders caused by mutations in LMNA.

Davies et al. (2010) created knockin mice harboring a mutant Lmna allele
that yielded exclusively nonfarnesylated prelamin A. These mice had no
evidence of progeria but succumbed to cardiomyopathy. Most of the
nonfarnesylated prelamin A in the tissues of these mice was localized at
the nuclear rim, indistinguishable from the lamin A in wildtype mice.
The cardiomyopathy could not be ascribed to an absence of lamin C
because mice expressing an otherwise identical knockin allele yielding
only wildtype prelamin A appeared normal. The authors concluded that
lamin C synthesis is dispensable in mice and that failure to convert
prelamin A to mature lamin A causes cardiomyopathy in the absence of
lamin C.

Choi et al. (2012) found that ERK activation in H222P/H222P mice
specifically upregulated expression of dual-specificity phosphatase-4
(DUSP4; 602747) in cardiac muscle, with much lower Dusp4 induction in
quadriceps muscle, and no Dusp4 induction in tongue, kidney, and liver.
Dusp4 overexpression in cultured C2C12 muscle cells or targeted to mouse
heart resulted in activation of the Akt (see AKT1; 164730)-Mtor (FRAP1;
601231) metabolic signaling pathway, leading to impaired autophagy and
abnormal cardiac metabolism, similar to findings in H222P/H222P mice.

In a family with autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy

In a family with autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy

In 2 families with autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
(181350), Bonne et al. (1999) found a G-to-C transversion in the LMNA
gene which, resulting in an arg527-to-pro (R527P) substitution. The
mutation, found in heterozygous state, was demonstrated to be de novo in
both families.

Van der Kooi et al. (2002) reported a woman with limb-girdle muscle
weakness, spinal rigidity, contractures, elevated creatine kinase,
cardiac conduction abnormalities (atrial fibrillation), partial
lipodystrophy (151660), and increased serum triglycerides who had the
R527P mutation. Van der Kooi et al. (2002) also reported a family with
the R527P mutation in which the proband, her father, and her son all
presented with varying degrees of EDMD, lipodystrophy, and cardiac
conduction abnormalities.

Makri et al. (2009) reported 2 sisters with early-onset autosomal
dominant muscular dystrophy most consistent with EDMD. Because the girls
were born of consanguineous Algerian parents, they were at first thought
to have an autosomal recessive congenital muscular dystrophy. However,
genetic analysis identified a heterozygous R527P mutation in the LMNA
gene in both patients that was not present in either unaffected parent.
The results were consistent with germline mosaicism or a recurrent de
novo event. The older sib had a difficult birth and showed congenital
hypotonia, diffuse weakness, and mild initial respiratory and feeding
difficulties. She sat unsupported at age 2 years and walked
independently from age 4 years with frequent falls and a waddling gait.
At 13 years she had a high-arched palate, moderate limb hypotonia, and
weakness of the pelvic muscles. There was proximal limb wasting,
moderate cervical, elbow, and ankle contractures, pes cavus, spinal
rigidity, and lordosis/scoliosis. Her sister had mild hypotonia in early
infancy, walked without support at 24 months, and showed proximal muscle
weakness. There were mild contractures of the elbow and ankles. At age 9
years, she showed adiposity of the neck, trunk and abdomen, consistent
with lipodystrophy. Brain MRI and cognition were normal in both sisters,
and neither had cardiac involvement. Muscle biopsies showed a dystrophic
pattern.

(181350), Bonne et al. (1999) detected a heterozygous T-to-C transition
in the LMNA gene, resulting in a leu530-to-pro (L530P) substitution.

LMNA, ARG60GLY

In a family with autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy with
conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200), Fatkin et al. (1999) identified a
178C-G transversion in the LMNA gene, resulting in an arg60-to-gly
(R60G) substitution.

Van der Kooi et al. (2002) reported a woman with partial lipodystrophy
(151660), hypertriglyceridemia, and cardiomyopathy with conduction
defects who carried the R60G mutation. The patient's mother reportedly
had similar manifestations. The authors noted that lipodystrophy and
cardiac abnormalities were combined manifestations of the same mutation.

In a family with autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy with
conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200), Fatkin et al. (1999) identified a

substitution.

LMNA, ASN195LYS

In a family with autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy with
conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200), Fatkin et al. (1999) identified a
585C-G transversion in the LMNA gene, resulting in an asn195-to-lys
(N195K) substitution.

Using cells from the mouse model of Mounkes et al. (2005), Ho et al.
(2013) found that Lmna N195K embryonic fibroblasts and bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells had impaired nuclear localization
of the mechanosensitive transcription factor MKL1 (606078). Cardiac
sections from Lmna(N195K/N195K) mice had significantly reduced fractions
of cardiomyocytes with nuclear Mkl1, implicating altered Mkl1 signaling
in the development of cardiomyopathy in these animals. Nuclear
accumulation of Mkl1 was substantially lower in Lmna N195K cells than in
wildtype cells. Altered nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Mkl1 was caused
by altered actin dynamics in Lmna(N195K/N195K) mutant cells. Ectopic
expression of the nuclear envelope protein emerin (300384) restored Mkl1
nuclear translocation and rescued actin dynamics in mutant cells.

In a family with autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy with
conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200), Fatkin et al. (1999) identified a

substitution.

LMNA, ARG571SER

In a family with autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy and
conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200), Fatkin et al. (1999) identified a
1711C-A transversion in the LMNA gene, resulting in an arg571-to-ser
(R571S) substitution. In this family, the C-terminal of lamin C was
selectively affected by the mutation, and the cardiac phenotype was
relatively milder than that associated with mutations in the rod domain
of the LMNA gene. Furthermore, there was subclinical evidence of
involvement of skeletal muscle. Although affected members of this family
had no skeletal muscle symptoms, some had elevated serum creatine kinase
levels, including 1 asymptomatic family member with the genotype
associated with the disease. The arg571-to-ser mutation affected only
lamin C isoforms, whereas previously described defects causing
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (181350) perturbed both lamin A and
lamin C isoforms.

LIPODYSTROPHY, FAMILIAL PARTIAL, TYPE 2
LMNA, ARG482GLN

In 5 probands from 5 Canadian kindreds with familial partial
lipodystrophy of the Dunnigan type (151660), Cao and Hegele (2000)
demonstrated heterozygosity for a G-to-A transition in exon 8 of the
LMNA gene, predicted to result in an arg484-to-gln (R482Q) substitution.
There were no differences in age, gender, or body mass index in
Q482/R482 heterozygotes compared with R482/R482 homozygotes (normals)
from these families; however, there were significantly more Q482/R482
heterozygotes who had definite partial lipodystrophy and frank diabetes.
Also compared with the normal homozygotes, heterozygotes had
significantly higher serum insulin and C-peptide (see 176730) levels.
The LMNA heterozygotes with diabetes were significantly older than
heterozygotes without diabetes.

Shackleton et al. (2000) found the R482Q mutation in a family with
familial partial lipodystrophy. Hegele et al. (2000) analyzed the
relationship between plasma leptin (164160) and the rare LMNA R482Q
mutation in 23 adult familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD) subjects
compared with 25 adult family controls with normal LMNA in an extended
Canadian FPLD kindred. They found that the LMNA Q482/R482 genotype was a
significant determinant of plasma leptin, the ratio of plasma leptin to
body mass index (BMI), plasma insulin, and plasma C peptide, but not
BMI. Family members who were Q482/R482 heterozygotes had significantly
lower plasma leptin and leptin:BMI ratio than unaffected R482/R482
homozygotes. Fasting plasma concentrations of insulin and C peptide were
both significantly higher in LMNA Q482/R482 heterozygotes than in
R482/R482 homozygotes. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that
the LMNA R482Q genotype accounted for 40.9%, 48.2%, 86.9%, and 81.0%,
respectively, of the attributable variation in log leptin, leptin:BMI
ratio, log insulin, and log C peptide. The authors concluded that a rare
FPLD mutation in LMNA determines the plasma leptin concentration.

Boguslavsky et al. (2006) found that overexpression of wildtype LMNA or
mutant R482Q or R482W (150330.0011) in mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes
prevented cellular lipid accumulation, inhibited triglyceride synthesis,
and prevented normal differentiation into adipocytes. In contrast,
embryonic fibroblasts from Lmna-null mice had increased levels of basal
triglyceride synthesis and differentiated into fat-containing cells more
readily that wildtype mouse cells. Mutations at residue 482 are not
predicted to affect the structure of the nuclear lamina, but may change
interactions with other proteins. The findings of this study suggested
that mutations responsible for FPLD are gain-of-function mutations.
Boguslavsky et al. (2006) postulated that mutations that result in gain
of function may cause higher binding affinity to a proadipogenic
transcription factor, thus preventing it from activating target genes;
overexpression of the wildtype protein may result in increased numbers
of molecules with a normal binding affinity. Overexpression of Lmna was
associated with decreased levels of PPARG2 (601487), a nuclear hormone
receptor transcription factor putatively involved in adipogenic
conversion. Lmna-null cells had increased basal phosphorylation of AKT1
(164730), a mediator of insulin signaling.

LIPODYSTROPHY, FAMILIAL PARTIAL, TYPE 2
LMNA, ARG482TRP

In 6 families and 3 isolated cases of partial lipodystrophy (151660),
Shackleton et al. (2000) found heterozygosity for C-to-T transition in
the LMNA gene, resulting in an arg482-to-trp (R482W) substitution. This
is the same codon as that affected in the R482Q mutation (150330.0010).
R482L (150330.0012) is a third mutation in the same codon causing
partial lipodystrophy.

Schmidt et al. (2001) identified a family with partial lipodystrophy
carrying the R482W mutation in the LMNA gene. Clinically, the loss of
subcutaneous fat and muscular hypertrophy, especially of the lower
extremities, started as early as in childhood. Acanthosis and severe
hypertriglyceridemia developed later in life, followed by diabetes.
Characterization of the lipoprotein subfractions revealed that affected
children present with hyperlipidemia. The presence and severity of
hyperlipidemia seem to be influenced by age, apolipoprotein E genotype,
and the coexistence of diabetes mellitus. In conclusion, dyslipidemia is
an early and prominent feature in the presented lipodystrophic family
carrying the R482W mutation.

In a family with partial lipodystrophy (151660), Shackleton et al.

In a large family with a severe autosomal dominant dilated
cardiomyopathy with conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200) in which the
majority of affected family members showed signs of mild skeletal muscle
involvement, Brodsky et al. (2000) demonstrated heterozygosity in
affected members for a 1-bp deletion (del959T) deletion in exon 6 of the
LMNA gene. One individual had a pattern of skeletal muscle involvement
that the authors considered consistent with mild Emery-Dreifuss muscular
dystrophy (181350).

LMNA, HIS222TYR

In a 40-year-old man with a severe, atypical form of EDMD (see 181350),
Raffaele di Barletta et al. (2000) found a homozygous 664C-T transition
in the LMNA gene, resulting in a his222-to-tyr (H222Y) amino acid
substitution. Both parents, who were first cousins, were heterozygous
for the mutation and were unaffected. The mutation was not found among
200 control chromosomes. The patient was the only one with a homozygous
LMNA mutation among a larger study of individuals with autosomal
dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.

Speckman et al. (2000) found that 1 of 15 families with familial partial

(G465D) mutation in exon 8 of the LMNA gene.

.0016
LIPODYSTROPHY, FAMILIAL PARTIAL, TYPE 2
LMNA, ARG582HIS

In a family with an atypical form of familial partial lipodystrophy
(151660), Speckman et al. (2000) identified an arg582-to-his (R582H)
mutation in exon 11 of the LMNA gene. In a follow-up of this same
family, Garg et al. (2001) reported that 2 affected sisters showed less
severe loss of subcutaneous fat from the trunk and extremities with some
retention of fat in the gluteal region and medial parts of the proximal
thighs compared to women with typical FPLD2. Noting that the R582H
mutation interrupts only the lamin A protein, Garg et al. (2001)
suggested that in typical FPLD2, interruption of both lamins A and C
causes a more severe phenotype than that seen in atypical FPLD2, in
which only lamin A is altered.

MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, LIMB-GIRDLE, TYPE 1B
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1A, INCLUDED
LMNA, ARG377HIS

In a family with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (159001), Muchir
et al. (2000) found a G-to-A transition in exon 6 of the LMNA gene,
resulting in a substitution of histidine for arginine-377 (R377H).

Taylor et al. (2003) identified heterozygosity for the R377H mutation in
an American family of British descent with autosomal dominant dilated
cardiomyopathy and mild limb-girdle muscular disease.

Charniot et al. (2003) described a French family with autosomal dominant
severe dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects or
atrial/ventricular arrhythmias and a skeletal muscular dystrophy of the
quadriceps muscles. Affected members were found to carry the R377H
mutation, which was shown by transfection experiments in both muscular
and nonmuscular cells to lead to mislocalization of both lamin and
emerin (300384). Unlike previously reported cases of LMNA mutations
causing dilated cardiomyopathy with neuromuscular involvement, cardiac
involvement preceded neuromuscular disease in all affected members.
Charniot et al. (2003) suggested that factors other than the R377H
mutation influenced phenotypic expression in this family. Sebillon et
al. (2003) also reported on this family.

In a German woman with LGMD1B, Rudnik-Schoneborn et al. (2007)
identified a heterozygous R377H mutation in the LMNA gene. Family
history revealed that the patient's paternal grandmother had proximal
muscle weakness and died from heart disease at age 52, and a paternal
aunt had 'walking difficulties' since youth. The patient's father and 4
cousins all had cardiac disease without muscle weakness ranging from
nonspecific 'heart attacks' to dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia.
The only living affected cousin also carried the mutation.

MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, LIMB-GIRDLE, TYPE 1B
LMNA, 3-BP DEL, EXON 3

In a family with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (159001), Muchir

resulting in loss of the codon for lysine-208 (delK208).

.0019

LMNA, IVS9, G-C, +5

In a family with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (159001), Muchir
et al. (2000) found a G-to-C transversion in the splice donor site of
intron 9, leading to retention of intron 9 and a frameshift at position
536. This potentially results in a truncated protein lacking half of the
globular tail domain of lamins A/C.

De Sandre-Giovannoli et al. (2002) found a homozygous arg298-to-cys

families with CMT2B1 (605588).

Ben Yaou et al. (2007) identified a homozygous R298C mutation in a
female and 2 male affected members of an Algerian family with CMT2B1.
The 2 males also had X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (310300)
and a hemizygous mutation in the EMD gene (300384).

MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY
MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY, ATYPICAL, INCLUDED
LMNA, ARG527HIS

In 5 consanguineous Italian families, Novelli et al. (2002) demonstrated
that individuals with mandibuloacral dysplasia (248370) were homozygous
for an arg527-to-his (R527H) mutation.

In affected members from 2 pedigrees with MADA, Simha et al. (2003)
identified the homozygous R527H mutation.

In a Mexican American boy with MADA born of related parents, Shen et al.
(2003) identified homozygosity for the R527H mutation. The authors noted
that all the patients reported by Novelli et al. (2002) shared a common
disease haplotype, but that the patients reported by Simha et al. (2003)
and their Mexican American patient had different haplotypes, indicating
independent origins of the mutation. The mutation is located within the
C-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain in the center of a beta sheet on
the domain surface of the protein.

Lombardi et al. (2007) identified this mutation in compound
heterozygosity with another missense mutation (150330.0044) in a patient
with an apparent MADA phenotype associated with muscular hyposthenia and
generalized hypotonia.

Garavelli et al. (2009) reported 2 unrelated patients with early
childhood onset of MADA features associated with a homozygous R527H
mutation. One presented at age 5 years, 3 months with bulbous distal
phalanges of fingers and was observed to have dysmorphic craniofacial
features, lipodystrophy type A, and acroosteolysis. The second child,
born of consanguineous Pakistani parents, presented at age 4 years, 2
months with a round face, chubby cheeks, thin nose, lipodystrophy type
A, and short, broad distal phalanges. Garavelli et al. (2009) emphasized
that features of this disorder may become apparent as early as preschool
age and that bulbous fingertips may be a clue to the diagnosis.

HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME
RESTRICTIVE DERMOPATHY, LETHAL, INCLUDED
LMNA, GLY608GLY

In 18 of 20 patients with classic Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome
(176670), Eriksson et al. (2003) found an identical de novo 1824C-T
transition, resulting in a silent gly-to-gly mutation at codon 608
(G608G) within exon 11 of the LMNA gene. This substitution created an
exonic consensus splice donor sequence and results in activation of a
cryptic splice site and deletion of 50 codons of prelamin A. This
mutation was not identified in any of the 16 parents available for
testing.

De Sandre-Giovannoli et al. (2003) identified the exon 11 cryptic splice
site activation mutation (1824C-T+1819-1968del) in 2 HGPS patients.
Immunocytochemical analyses of lymphocytes from 1 patient using specific
antibodies directed against lamin A/C, lamin A, and lamin B1 showed that
most cells had strikingly altered nuclear sizes and shapes, with
envelope interruptions accompanied by chromatin extrusion. Lamin A was
detected in 10 to 20% of HGPS lymphocytes. Only lamin C was present in
most cells, and lamin B1 was found in the nucleoplasm, suggesting that
it had dissociated from the nuclear envelope due to the loss of lamin A.
Western blot analysis showed 25% of normal lamin A levels, and no
truncated form was detected.

Cao and Hegele (2003) confirmed the observations of Eriksson et al.
(2003) using the same cell lines. They referred to this mutation as
2036C-T.

D'Apice et al. (2004) confirmed paternal age effect and demonstrated a
paternal origin of the 2036C-T mutation in 3 families with isolated
cases of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria.

By light and electron microscopy of fibroblasts from HGPS patients
carrying the 1824C-T mutation, Goldman et al. (2004) found significant
changes in nuclear shape, including lobulation of the nuclear envelope,
thickening of the nuclear lamina, loss of peripheral heterochromatin,
and clustering of nuclear pores. These structural defects worsened as
the HGPS cells aged in culture, and their severity correlated with an
apparent accumulation of mutant protein, which Goldman et al. (2004)
designated LA delta-50. Introduction of LA delta-50 into normal cells by
transfection or protein injection induced the same changes. Goldman et
al. (2004) hypothesized that the alterations in nuclear structure are
due to a concentration-dependent dominant-negative effect of LA
delta-50, leading to the disruption of lamin-related functions ranging
from the maintenance of nuclear shape to regulation of gene expression
and DNA replication.

In an infant with restrictive dermopathy (275210), Navarro et al. (2004)
identified the 1824C-T transition in heterozygous state.

In a patient with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria, Wuyts et al. (2005)
identified the G608G mutation. In lymphocyte DNA from the parents,
normal wildtype alleles were observed in the father, but a low signal
corresponding to the mutant allele was detected in the mother's DNA. A
segregation study confirmed that the patient's mutation was transmitted
from the mother, who showed germline and somatic mosaicism without
manifestations of HGPS.

Glynn and Glover (2005) studied the effects of farnesylation inhibition
on nuclear phenotypes in cells expressing normal and G608G-mutant lamin
A. Expression of a GFP-progerin fusion protein in normal fibroblasts
caused a high incidence of nuclear abnormalities (as seen in HGPS
fibroblasts), and resulted in abnormal nuclear localization of
GFP-progerin in comparison with the localization pattern of GFP-lamin A.
Expression of a GFP-lamin A fusion containing a mutation preventing the
final cleavage step, which caused the protein to remain farnesylated,
displayed identical localization patterns and nuclear abnormalities as
in HGPS cells and in cells expressing GFP-progerin. Exposure to a
farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI), PD169541, caused a significant
improvement in the nuclear morphology of cells expressing GFP-progerin
and in HGPS cells. Glynn and Glover (2005) proposed that abnormal
farnesylation of progerin may play a role in the cellular phenotype in
HGPS cells, and suggested that FTIs may represent a therapeutic option
for patients with HGPS.

In cells from a female patient with HGPS due to the 1824C-T mutation,
Shumaker et al. (2006) found that the inactive X chromosome showed loss
of histone H3 trimethylation of lys27 (H3K27me3), a marker for
facultative heterochromatin, as well as loss of histone H3
trimethylation of lys9 (H3K9me3), a marker of pericentric constitutive
heterochromatin. Other alterations in epigenetic control included
downregulation of the EZH2 methyltransferase (601573), upregulation of
pericentric satellite III repeat transcripts, and increase in the
trimethylation of H4K20. The epigenetic alterations were observed before
the pathogenic changes in nuclear shape. The findings indicated that the
mutant LMNA protein alters sites of histone methylation known to
regulate heterochromatin and provided evidence that the rapid aging
phenotype of HGPS reflects aspects of normal aging at the molecular
level.

Moulson et al. (2007) demonstrated that HGPS cells with the common
1824C-T LMNA mutation produced about 37.5% of wildtype full-length
transcript, which was higher than previous estimates (Reddel and Weiss,
2004).

Using real-time RT-PCR, Rodriguez et al. (2009) found that progerin
transcripts were expressed in dermal fibroblasts cultured from normal
controls, but at a level more than 160-fold lower than that detected in
dermal fibroblasts cultured from HGPS patients. The level of progerin
transcripts, but not of lamin A or lamin C transcripts, increased in
late-passage cells from both normal controls and HGPS patients.

HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME
LMNA, GLY608SER

In a patient with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (176670),
Eriksson et al. (2003) identified a G-to-A transition in the LMNA gene
resulting in a gly-to-ser substitution at codon 608 (G608S). This
mutation was not identified in either parent.

Cao and Hegele (2003) confirmed the observation of Eriksson et al.
(2003) using the same cell line.

HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME, ATYPICAL
LMNA, GLU145LYS

In a patient with somewhat atypical features of progeria (176670),
Eriksson et al. (2003) identified a glu-to-lys substitution at codon 145
(E145K) in exon 2 of the LMNA gene. This mutation was not identified in
either parent. Atypical clinical features, including persistence of
coarse hair over the head, ample subcutaneous tissue over the arms and
legs, and severe strokes beginning at age 4, may subtly distinguish this
phenotype from classic HGPS.

.0025
MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY, ATYPICAL
LMNA, ARG471CYS

In a patient with an apparently typical progeria phenotype (176670) who
was 28 years old at the time that DNA was obtained, Cao and Hegele
(2003) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in
the LMNA gene. One mutation, arg471 to cys (R471C), resulted from a
1623C-T transition. An arg527-to-cys (R527C) substitution (150330.0026),
resulting from a 1791C-T transition, was found on the other allele.
These mutations were not identified in any of 100 control chromosomes.
Parental DNA for this patient and a clinical description of the parents
were not available. Brown (2004) reported that both he and the patient's
physician, Francis Collins, concluded that the patient had
mandibuloacral dysplasia (248370).

Zirn et al. (2008) reported a 7-year-old Turkish girl, born of
consanguineous parents, who was homozygous for the R471C mutation. She
had a phenotype most consistent with an atypical form of MADA, including
lipodystrophy, a progeroid appearance, and congenital muscular dystrophy
with rigid spine syndrome. These latter features were reminiscent of
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (181350), although there was no
cardiac involvement. She presented at age 10 months with proximal muscle
weakness, contractures, spinal rigidity, and a dystrophic skeletal
muscle biopsy. Characteristic progeroid features and features of
lipodystrophy and mandibuloacral dysplasia were noted at age 3 years and
became more apparent with age. Zirn et al. (2008) commented on the
severity of the phenotype and emphasized the phenotypic variability in
patients with LMNA mutations.

LIPODYSTROPHY, FAMILIAL PARTIAL, TYPE 2
HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME, CHILDHOOD-ONSET, INCLUDED
LMNA, ARG133LEU

In a male patient whose phenotype associated generalized acquired
lipoatrophy with insulin-resistant diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and
hepatic steatosis (151660), Caux et al. (2003) found a heterozygous
398G-T transversion in exon 2 of the LMNA gene that resulted in an
arg-to-leu change at codon 133 (R133L) in the dimerization rod domain of
lamins A and C. The patient also had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with
valvular involvement and disseminated whitish papules.
Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis of the patient's cultured skin
fibroblasts revealed nuclear disorganization and abnormal distribution
of A-type lamins, similar to that observed in patients harboring other
LMNA mutations. This observation broadened the clinical spectrum of
laminopathies, pointing out the clinical variability of lipodystrophy
and the possibility of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and skin involvement.

In 2 unrelated persons with a progeroid syndrome (see 176670), Chen et
al. (2003) found heterozygosity for the R1333L mutation in the LMNA
gene. One was a white Portuguese female who presented at the age of 9
years with short stature. She showed scleroderma-like skin changes and
graying/thinning of hair. Type 2 diabetes developed at the age of 23
years. Hypogonadism, osteoporosis, and voice changes were also present.
The other patient was an African American female in whom the diagnosis
of a progeroid syndrome was made at the age of 18 years.
Scleroderma-like skin, short stature, graying/thinning of hair, and type
2 diabetes at the age of 18 years were features. The deceased father,
paternal aunt, and paternal grandmother of this patient were also
diagnosed with severe insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus, suggesting
that the R133L mutation might have been paternally inherited. It is
noteworthy that a substitution in the same codon, R133P (150330.0032),
was reported in a 40-year-old patient with Emery-Dreifuss muscular
dystrophy who had disease onset at age 7 years and atrial fibrillation
at age 32 years (Brown et al., 2001). Although Chen et al. (2003)
designated these patients as having 'atypical Werner syndrome' (277700),
Hegele (2003) suggested that the patients more likely had late-onset
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.

Vigouroux et al. (2003) emphasized that a striking feature in the
patient reported by Caux et al. (2003) was muscular hypertrophy of the
limbs, which contrasts with the muscular atrophy usually present in
Werner syndrome. Muscular hypertrophy, along with insulin-resistant
diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, is more often associated with
LMNA-linked Dunnigan lipodystrophy. Fibroblasts from their patient
showed nuclear abnormalities identical to those described in Dunnigan
lipodystrophy (Vigouroux et al., 2001).

Jacob et al. (2005) studied the pattern of body fat distribution and
metabolic abnormalities in the 2 patients with atypical Werner syndrome
described by Chen et al. (2003). Patient 1, an African American female,
had normal body fat (27%) by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).
However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed relative paucity of
subcutaneous fat in the distal extremities, with preservation of
subcutaneous truncal fat. She had impaired glucose tolerance and
elevated postprandial serum insulin levels. In contrast, patient 2, a
Caucasian female, had only 11.6% body fat as determined by DEXA and had
generalized loss of subcutaneous and intraabdominal fat on MRI. She had
hypertriglyceridemia and severe insulin-resistant diabetes requiring
more than 200 U of insulin daily. Skin fibroblasts showed markedly
abnormal nuclear morphology compared with those from patient 1. Despite
the deranged nuclear morphology, the lamin A/C remained localized to the
nuclear envelope, and the nuclear DNA remained within the nucleus. Jacob
et al. (2005) concluded that atypical Werner syndrome associated with an
R133L mutation in the LMNA gene is phenotypically heterogeneous.
Furthermore, the severity of metabolic complications seemed to correlate
with the extent of lipodystrophy.

CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1A
LMNA, GLU161LYS

Sebillon et al. (2003) described a family with a history of sudden
cardiac death, congestive heart failure, and dilated cardiomyopathy
(CMD1A; 115200). Five affected members had a heterozygous 481G-A
transition in exon 2 of the LMNA gene, resulting in a glu161-to-lys
(E161K) mutation. Dilated cardiomyopathy was present in only 2 patients,
in whom onset of the disease was characterized by congestive heart
failure and atrial fibrillation (at 29 and 44 years, respectively);
heart transplantation was performed in both patients (at 34 and 51 years
of age). In the 3 other affected members, the onset of disease was also
characterized by atrial fibrillation at 22, 49, and 63 years, but
without dilated cardiomyopathy. A 16-year-old male and 12-year-old
female were also heterozygous for the mutation, but had no signs or
symptoms of heart disease. The 5 affected members were a mother and 2
daughters in 1 branch of the family and 2 brothers in another branch.
Two cardiac deaths were reported in the family history: sudden death at
38 years and congestive heart failure at 68 years. No significant
atrioventricular block was observed in the family, except in 1 patient
for whom cardiac pacing was necessary at 67 years of age because of
sinoatrial block coexisting with atrial fibrillation. Sebillon et al.
(2003) concluded that the phenotype in this family was characterized by
early atrial fibrillation preceding or coexisting with dilated
cardiomyopathy, without significant atrioventricular block, and without
neuromuscular abnormalities.

.0029
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1A
LMNA, 1-BP INS, 28A

Sebillon et al. (2003) described a family in which 5 patients with
dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200) were
heterozygous for a 1-bp insertion, 28insA, in exon 1 of the LMNA gene.
Three additional patients were considered as phenotypically affected
with documented dilated cardiomyopathy but were not available for DNA
analysis. In the family history, there were 3 cardiac sudden deaths
before 55 years of age. In the patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, 3
had associated atrioventricular block requiring pacemaker implantation,
1 had premature ventricular beats leading to a cardioverter
defibrillator implantation, and 1 had a mild form of skeletal muscular
dystrophy (mild weakness and wasting of quadriceps muscles, as well as
myogenic abnormalities on electromyogram).

.0030
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, WITH HYPERGONADOTRIPIC HYPOGONADISM
LMNA, ALA57PRO

In an Iranian female with short stature and a progeroid syndrome (see
176670), Chen et al. (2003) found a heterozygous de novo ala57-to-pro
substitution (A57P) resulting from a 584G-C transversion in the LMNA
gene. Onset occurred in her early teens, and she was 23 years old at
diagnosis. Hypogonadism, osteoporosis, osteosclerosis of digits, and
dilated cardiomyopathy were described. Although Chen et al. (2003)
designated this patient as having 'atypical Werner syndrome' (277700),
Hegele (2003) suggested that the patient more likely had late-onset
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.

McPherson et al. (2009) suggested that the patient in whom Chen et al.
(2003) identified an A57P LMNA mutation had a distinct phenotype
involving dilated cardiomyopathy and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism
(212112).

.0031
HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME, CHILDHOOD-ONSET
LMNA, LEU140ARG

In a white Norwegian male with a progeroid syndrome (see 176670), Chen
et al. (2003) found a leu140-to-arg (L140R) substitution resulting from
an 834T-G transversion in the LMNA gene. The patient had onset at age 14
of cataracts, scleroderma-like skin, and graying/thinning of hair, as
well as hypogonadism, osteoporosis, soft tissue calcification, and
premature atherosclerosis. Aortic stenosis and insufficiency were also
present. The patient died at the age of 36 years. Although Chen et al.
(2003) designated this patient as having 'atypical Werner syndrome'
(277700), Hegele (2003) suggested that the patient more likely had
late-onset Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.

.0032
EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
LMNA, ARG133PRO

In a 40-year-old patient with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (181350)
who had disease onset at age 7 years and atrial fibrillation at age 32
years, Brown et al. (2001) found an arg133-to-pro (R133P) mutation in
the LMNA gene. Chen et al. (2003) noted that the same codon is involved
in the arg133-to-leu (150330.0027) mutation in atypical Werner syndrome.

.0033
MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY
LMNA, LYS542ASN

In 4 affected members of a consanguineous family from north India with
features of MADA (248370). Plasilova et al. (2004) identified a
homozygous 1626G-C transversion in exon 10 of the LMNA gene, resulting
in a lys542-to-asn (K542N) substitution. The parents and 1 unaffected
daughter were heterozygous for the mutation. Patients in this family
showed uniform skeletal malformations such as acroosteolysis of the
digits, micrognathia, and clavicular aplasia/hypoplasia, characteristic
of mandibuloacral dysplasia. However, the patients also had classic
features of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (176670). Plasilova et
al. (2004) suggested that autosomal recessive HGPS and MADA may
represent a single disorder with varying degrees of severity.

.0034
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL, LMNA-RELATED
LMNA, SER143PHE

In a young girl with congenital muscular dystrophy and progeroid
features (see 613205), Kirschner et al. (2005) identified a 1824C-T
transition in the LMNA gene, resulting in a de novo heterozygous
missense mutation, ser143 to phe (S143F). The child presented during the
first year of life with myopathy with marked axial weakness, feeding
difficulties, poor head control and axial weakness. Progeroid features,
including growth failure, sclerodermatous skin changes, and osteolytic
lesions, developed later. At routine examination at age 8 years, she was
found to have a mediolateral myocardial infarction.

In cultured skin fibroblasts derived from the patient reported by
Kirschner et al. (2005), Kandert et al. (2007) found dysmorphic nuclei
with blebs and lobulations that accumulated progressively with cell
passage. Immunofluorescent staining showed altered lamin A/C
organization and aggregate formation. There was aberrant localization of
lamin-associated proteins, particularly emerin (EMD; 300384) and
nesprin-2 (SYNE2; 608442), which was reduced or absent from the nuclear
envelope. However, a subset of mutant cells expressing the giant 800-kD
isoform of SYNE2 showed a milder phenotype, suggesting that this isoform
exerts a protective effect. Proliferating cells were observed to express
the 800-kD SYNE2 isoform, whereas nonproliferating cells did not. In
addition, mutant cells showed defects in the intranuclear organization
of acetylated histones and RNA polymerase II compared to control cells.
The findings indicated that the S143F mutant protein affects nuclear
envelope architecture and composition, chromatin organization, gene
expression, and transcription. The findings also implicated nesprin-2 as
a structural reinforcer at the nuclear envelope.

.0035
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, LIMB-GIRDLE, TYPE 1B
LMNA, TYR259TER

In 9 affected members of Dutch family with limb-girdle muscular
dystrophy type 1B (159001), van Engelen et al. (2005) identified a
777T-A transversion in the LMNA gene, resulting in a tyr259-to-ter
substitution (Y259X). The heterozygous Y259X mutation led to a classic
LGMD1B phenotype. One infant homozygous for the mutation was born of
consanguineous parents who were both affected, and delivered at 30
weeks' gestational age by cesarean section because of decreasing cardiac
rhythm. The infant died at birth from very severe generalized muscular
dystrophy. Cultured skin fibroblasts from the infant showed complete
absence of A-type lamins leading to disorganization of the lamina,
alterations in the protein composition of the inner nuclear membrane,
and decreased life span. Van Engelen et al. (2005) noted that the
fibroblasts from this child showed remarkable similarity, in nuclear
architectural defects and in decreased life span, to the fibroblasts of
homozygous LMNA (L530P/L530P) mice (Mounkes et al., 2003).

.0036
RESTRICTIVE DERMOPATHY, LETHAL
HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME, INCLUDED
LMNA, IVS11, G-A, +1

In a premature infant who died at 6 months of age due to restrictive
dermopathy (275210), Navarro et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous
G-to-A transition at position 1 in the intron 11 donor site of the LMNA
gene (IVS11+1G-A), resulting in loss of exon 11 from the transcript. The
patient expressed lamins A and C and a truncated prelamin A.

In a patient with an extremely severe form of HGPS (176670), Moulson et
al. (2007) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition at the +1
position of the donor splice site of intron 11 in the LMNA gene
(1968+1G-A). RT-PCR studies showed a truncated protein product identical
to that observed in HGPS cell lines with the common 1824C-T mutation
(150330.0022), indicating that the new mutation resulted in the abnormal
use of the same cryptic exon 11 splice site. The findings were in
contrast to those reported by Navarro et al. (2004), who observed
skipping of exon 11 with 1968+1G-A. Further quantitative studies of the
patient's cells by Moulson et al. (2007) found a 4.5-fold increase in
the relative ratio of mutant mRNA and protein to wildtype prelamin A
compared to typical HGPS cells. The findings were confirmed by Western
blot analysis and provided an explanation for the severe phenotype
observed in this patient. He had had abnormally thick and tight skin
observed at 11 weeks of age, and developed more typical but severe
progeroid features over time. He died of infection at age 3.5 years.

.0037
MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY
LMNA, ALA529VAL

In 2 unrelated Turkish patients with mandibuloacral dysplasia with type
A lipodystrophy (248370), a 21-year-old woman previously described by
Cogulu et al. (2003) and an 18-year-old man, Garg et al. (2005)
identified homozygosity for a 1586C-T transition in the LMNA gene,
resulting in an ala529-to-val (A529V) substitution. Intragenic SNPs
revealed a common haplotype spanning 2.5 kb around the mutated
nucleotide in the parents of both patients, suggesting ancestral origin
of the mutation. The female patient had no breast development despite
normal menstruation, a phenotype different from that seen in women with
the R527H mutation (150330.0021).

.0038
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, LIMB-GIRDLE, TYPE 1B
LMNA, GLN493TER

In a German woman with LGMD1B (159001), Rudnik-Schoneborn et al. (2007)
identified a heterozygous 1477C-T transition in exon 8 of the LMNA gene,
resulting in a gln493-to-ter (Q493X) substitution. She presented with
slowly progressive proximal muscle weakness beginning in the lower
extremities and later involving the upper extremities. EMG showed both
neurogenic and myopathic defects in the quadriceps muscle. At age 53
years, she was diagnosed with atrioventricular conduction block and
arrhythmia requiring pacemaker implantation. Family history showed that
her mother had walking difficulties from age 40 years and died of a
heart attack at age 54. Six other deceased family members had suspected
cardiomyopathy without muscle involvement.

.0039
LIPODYSTROPHY, FAMILIAL PARTIAL, TYPE 2
LMNA, IVS8, G-C, +5

Morel et al. (2006) reported 2 sisters, the children of
nonconsanguineous Punjabi parents, with familial partial lipodystrophy
type 2 (FPLD2; 151660). The first presented with acanthosis nigricans at
age 5 years, diabetes with insulin resistance, hypertension, and
hypertriglyceridemia at age 13 years, and partial lipodystrophy starting
at puberty. Her sister and their mother had a similar metabolic profile
and physical features, and their mother died of vascular disease at age
32 years. LMNA sequencing showed that the sisters were each heterozygous
for a novel G-to-C mutation at the intron 8 consensus splice donor site,
which was absent from the genomes of 300 healthy individuals. The
retention of intron 8 in mRNA predicted a prematurely truncated lamin A
isoform (516 instead of 664 amino acids) with 20 nonsense 3-prime
terminal residues. The authors concluded that this was the first LMNA
splicing mutation to be associated with FPLD2, and that it causes a
severe clinical and metabolic phenotype.

.0040
HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME
LMNA, VAL607VAL

In a patient with a severe form of HGPS (176670), Moulson et al. (2007)
identified a de novo heterozygous 1821G-A transition in exon 11 of the
LMNA gene, resulting in a val607-to-val (V607V) substitution. The
1821G-A mutation favored the use of the same cryptic splice site as the
common 1824C-T mutation (150330.0022) and produced the same resultant
progerin product. However, the ratio of mutant to wildtype mRNA and
protein was increased in the patient compared to typical HGPS cells. The
patient had flexion contractures, thick and tight skin, and other severe
progeroid features. He died of infection at 26 days of age.

LMNA, SER573LEU

In a 50-year-old Italian woman with sporadic dilated cardiomyopathy with
conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200), Taylor et al. (2003) identified
heterozygosity for a 1718C-T transition in exon 11 of the LMNA gene,
resulting in a ser573-to-leu substitution at a highly conserved residue,
predicted to affect the carboxyl tail of the lamin A isoform. The
mutation was not found in the proband's 2 unaffected offspring or in 300
control chromosomes, but her unaffected 60-year-old sister also carried
the mutation.

Van Esch et al. (2006) analyzed the LMNA gene in a 44-year-old male of
European descent with arthropathy, tendinous calcifications, and a
progeroid appearance (see 248370) and identified homozygosity for the
S573L mutation. Progeroid features included a small pinched nose, small
lips, micrognathia with crowded teeth, cataract, and alopecia. He also
had generalized lipodystrophy, and sclerodermatous skin. The arthropathy
affected predominantly the distal femora and proximal tibia in the knee
with tendinous calcifications. However, he had normal clavicles and no
evidence of acroosteolysis. The authors concluded that he had a novel
phenotype. The patient's unaffected 15-year-old son was heterozygous for
the mutation, which was not found in 450 control chromosomes. The
authors noted that the patient had no evidence of cardiomyopathy and his
70-year-old mother, an obligate heterozygote, had no known cardiac
problems.

In a 75-year-old European male with partial lipodystrophy (151660),
Lanktree et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for the S573L mutation
in the LMNA gene.

In a 46-year-old South Asian female with partial lipodystrophy (151660),
Lanktree et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a 688G-A transition
in exon 4 of the LMNA gene, resulting in an asp230-to-asn (D230N)
substitution at a conserved residue located 5-prime to the nuclear
localization signal. The mutation, predicted to affect only the lamin A
isoform, was not found in 200 controls of multiple ethnic backgrounds.

LIPODYSTROPHY, FAMILIAL PARTIAL, TYPE 2
LMNA, ARG399CYS

In a 50-year-old European female with partial lipodystrophy (151660),
Lanktree et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a 1195C-T
transition in exon 7 of the LMNA gene, resulting in an arg399-to-cys
(R399C) substitution at a conserved residue located 5-prime to the
nuclear localization signal. The mutation, predicted to affect only the
lamin A isoform, was not found in 200 controls of multiple ethnic
backgrounds.

Decaudain et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous R399 mutation in a
woman with severe metabolic syndrome. She was diagnosed with
insulin-resistant diabetes at age 32. Chronic hyperglycemia led to
retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and renal failure. She had severe
hypertriglyceridemia and diffuse atherosclerosis, requiring coronary
artery bypass at age 49. Physical examination revealed android fat
distribution with lipoatrophy of lower limbs and calves hypertrophy
without any muscle weakness. Her mother and a brother had diabetes and
died several years earlier.

.0044
MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY, ATYPICAL
LMNA, VAL440MET

In a 27-year-old Italian woman with a mandibuloacral dysplasia type A
(MADA; 248370)-like phenotype, Lombardi et al. (2007) found compound
heterozygosity for missense mutations in the LMNA cDNA: a G-to-A
transition at position 1318 in exon 7 that gave rise to a val-to-met
substitution at codon 440 (V440M), and an R527H substitution
(150330.0021). Each healthy parent was a simple heterozygote for one or
the other mutation. The apparent MADA phenotype was associated with
muscular hyposthenia and generalized hypotonia. Clavicular hypoplasia
and metabolic imbalances were absent. Lombardi et al. (2007)
hypothesized that lack of homozygosity for the R527H mutation attenuated
the MADA phenotype, while the V440M mutation may have contributed to
both the muscle phenotype and the pathogenic effect of the single R527H
mutation.

In affected members of a Slovenian family with heart-hand syndrome
(610140), originally reported by Sinkovec et al. (2005), Renou et al.
(2008) identified heterozygosity for a T-G transversion in intron 9 of
the LMNA gene (IVS9-12T-G), predicted to cause a frameshift and
premature termination in exon 10, with the addition of 14 new amino
acids at the C terminus. The mutation was not found in unaffected family
members or in 100 healthy controls. Analysis of fibroblasts from 2
affected individuals confirmed the presence of truncated protein and
revealed aberrant localization of lamin A/C accumulated in intranuclear
foci as well as dysmorphic nuclei with nuclear envelope herniations.

MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY
LMNA, ALA529THR

In a 56-year-old Japanese woman, born of consanguineous parents, with
mandibuloacral dysplasia and type A lipodystrophy (248370), Kosho et al.
(2007) identified a homozygous 1585G-A transition in exon 9 of the LMNA
gene, resulting in an ala529-to-thr (A529T) substitution. The authors
stated that she was the oldest reported patient with the disorder. In
addition to classic MAD with lipodystrophy type A phenotype, including
progeroid appearance, acroosteolysis of the distal phalanges, and loss
of subcutaneous fat in the limbs, she had severe progressive destructive
skeletal and osteoporotic changes. Vertebral collapse led to paralysis.
However, Kosho et al. (2007) also noted that other factors may have
contributed to the severe osteoporosis observed in this patient. Another
mutation in this codon, A529V (150330.0037), results in a similar
phenotype.

mutation in exon 6 of the LMNA gene, resulting in a leu380-to-ser
(L380S) substitution. He showed decreased movements in utero, hypotonia,
talipes foot deformities, no head or trunk control, distal joint

In a 9-year-old girl with congenital muscular dystrophy (613205),
Quijano-Roy et al. (2008) identified a de novo heterozygous mutation in
exon 4 of the LMNA gene, resulting in an arg249-to-trp (R249W)
substitution. She presented at age 3 to 6 months with axial weakness and
talipes foot deformities. She lost head support at 9 months, had
respiratory insufficiency, joint contractures, and axial and limb muscle
weakness. A de novo heterozygous R249W mutation was also identified in
an unrelated 3-year-old boy with congenital LGMD1B who showed decreased
movements in utero, hypotonia, distal contractures, no head or trunk
control, and respiratory insufficiency. Both patients had increased
serum creatine kinase and showed myopathic changes on EMG studies.

Mercuri et al. (2004) identified a de novo heterozygous 1072G-A
transition in exon 5 of the LMNA gene, resulting in a glu358-to-lys
(E358K) substitution in 5 unrelated patients with muscular dystrophy.
Three patients had the common phenotype of autosomal dominant
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (181350), 1 had early-onset LGMD1B
(159001), and the last had had a more severe disorder consistent with
congenital muscular dystrophy (613205). The mutation was not identified
in 150 controls. The patient with LGMD1B also had cardiac conduction
abnormalities, respiratory failure, and features of lipodystrophy
(151660). Mercuri et al. (2004) commented on the extreme phenotypic
variability associated with this mutation.

In 4 unrelated patients with LMNA-related congenital muscular dystrophy,
Quijano-Roy et al. (2008) identified a de novo heterozygous mutation in
exon 6 of the LMNA gene, resulting in a glu358-to-lys (E358K)
substitution. Three patients presented before 1 year of age with
hypotonia and later developed head drop with neck muscle weakness. There
was delayed motor development with early loss of ambulation, distal limb
contractures, axial and limb muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency
requiring mechanical ventilation, increased serum creatine kinase, and
dystrophic changes on muscle biopsy. One patient developed ventricular
tachycardia at age 20 years. The fourth patient with congenital LGMD1B
had decreased fetal movements and presented at age 3 to 6 months with
hypotonia, loss of head control, and delayed motor development.

LMNA, 3-BP DEL, 94AAG

In an 18-month-old boy with LMNA-related congenital muscular dystrophy
(613205), D'Amico et al. (2005) identified a de novo heterozygous 3-bp
deletion (94delAAG) in exon 1 of the LMNA gene, resulting in the
deletion of lys32. Although he had normal early motor development, he
showed prominent neck extensor weakness resulting in a 'dropped head'
phenotype at age 1 year. He was able to stand independently but had some
difficulty walking.

.0051
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
LMNA, ARG644CYS

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to various phenotypes has not been confirmed.

An arg644-to-cys (R644C) mutation in the LMNA gene has been found in
several different phenotypic presentations (Genschel et al., 2001;
Mercuri et al., 2005; Rankin et al., 2008); however, the pathogenicity
of the mutation has not been confirmed (Moller et al., 2009).

In a German patient with dilated cardiomyopathy with no history history
of conduction system disease (see 152000), Genschel et al. (2001)
identified heterozygosity for a 1930C-T transition in exon 11 of the
LMNA gene resulting in an R644C substitution in the C-terminal domain of
lamin A. The authors noted that the mutation is solely within lamin A,
but not lamin C, whereas previously reported mutations causing dilated
cardiomyopathy are located more in the rod domain of the protein.

Mercuri et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for the R644C mutation
in 4 patients with skeletal and cardiac muscle involvement of varying
severity. In 1 patient, the mutation was found in the affected brother
and the unaffected father, and was not found in the affected mother. The
mutation was not found in 100 unrelated control subjects.

Rankin et al. (2008) described 9 patients in 8 families with the same
mutation. Patients 1 and 2 presented with lipodystrophy and insulin
resistance; patient 1 also had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.
Patient 3 presented with motor neuropathy, patient 4 with arthrogryposis
and dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular noncompaction, patient
5 with severe scoliosis and contractures, patient 6 with limb-girdle
weakness, and patient 7 with hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance.
Patients 8 and 9 were brothers who had proximal weakness and
contractures. The same LMNA was identified in 9 unaffected individuals
in these 9 families, but was not detected in 200 German and 300 British
controls. Rankin et al. (2008) suggested that extreme phenotypic
diversity and low penetrance are associated with the R644C mutation.

CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, WITH HYPERGONADOTRIPIC HYPOGONADISM
LMNA, LEU59ARG

In a 17-year-old Caucasian female with dilated cardiomyopathy and
ovarian failure (212112), Nguyen et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity
for a de novo 176T-C transition in exon 1 of the LMNA gene, predicted to
result in a leu59-to-arg (L59R) substitution. Analysis of nuclear
morphology in patient fibroblasts showed more irregularity and variation
than that of control fibroblasts, with denting, blebbing, and irregular
margins. The mutation was not found in the unaffected parents or in 116
population-based controls.

In a 15-year-old Caucasian girl with dilated cardiomyopathy and ovarian
failure who died from an arrhythmia while awaiting cardiac
transplantation, McPherson et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for
the L59R mutation in the LMNA gene. The mutation was presumed to be de
novo, although the unaffected parents declined DNA testing. The patient
also had a healthy older sister, and there was no family history of
cardiomyopathy or hypogonadism.

CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1A
LMNA, ARG541GLY

In 2 sibs with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1A; 115200), Malek et al.
(2011) identified a heterozygous 1621C-G transversion in exon 10 of the
LMNA gene, resulting in an arg541-to-gly (R541G) substitution in the
C-terminal tail region. The 23-year-old male proband had a history of
paroxysmal atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and was found by
echocardiogram to have dilation of the left ventricle and global
hypokinesis. Cardiac MRI showed discrete regional areas of akinesis with
muscle thinning in the left ventricle and marked hypertrabeculation in
dysfunctional regions, as well as evidence of fibrosis. The proband's
sister had sinus bradycardia and supraventricular and ventricular
arrhythmias, but normal echocardiogram and cardiac MRI. The sibs' father
and paternal aunt had both died of dilated cardiomyopathy. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the R541G mutant resulted in
the formation of abnormal lamin aggregates, most of which were
sickle-shaped, suggesting aberrant formation of the inner nuclear lamina
from misassembled lamin dimers.

184755	TITLE *184755 STEROL CARRIER PROTEIN 2; SCP2
;;STEROL CARRIER PROTEIN X; SCPX
DESCRIPTION Sterol carrier protein-2 (SC2) is a peroxisomal enzyme with thiolase
activity that is required for the breakdown of branched-chain fatty
acids (summary by Ferdinandusse et al., 2006).

Sterol carrier protein-2 was the second peroxisomal thiolase to be
identified; see ACAA1 (604054).

CLONING

Yamamoto et al. (1991) used rat SCP2 cDNA to isolate a homologous human
liver SCP2 cDNA. SCP2 encodes a deduced 143-amino acid protein that
shares 89% sequence identity with the rat protein. SCP2 contains a
20-residue N-terminal leader sequence before the mature 13.2-kD
polypeptide, which contains a C-terminal tripeptide related to the
peroxisome targeting sequence. Northern blot analysis identified 2 mRNA
transcripts of 1.8 and 3.2 kb in liver; in fibroblasts and placenta, the
1.8-kb transcript was most abundant.

GENE FUNCTION

Yamamoto et al. (1991) noted that in steroid hormone producing cells
SCP2 is thought to facilitate the transport of cholesterol to
mitochondria, where the first committed step in steroidogenesis takes
place. Yamamoto et al. (1991) demonstrated that coexpression of the SCP2
cDNA with expression vectors for cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme
and adrenodoxin resulted in a 2.5-fold enhancement of progestin
synthesis over that obtained with expression of the steroidogenic enzyme
system alone.

Sterol carrier protein-2 is present in low levels in Zellweger syndrome
(see 214100), in which the cells are deficient in peroxisomes (van
Amerongen et al., 1987).

MAPPING

Yamamoto et al. (1991) used sequences in the 3-prime untranslated region
of the SCP2 cDNA to design PCR primers for use in mapping studies of
human/rodent somatic cell hybrids. In this way, they demonstrated that
the gene is located on the segment 1pter-p21 (He et al., 1991).

Vesa et al. (1994) refined the chromosomal assignment of SCP2 to 1p32 by
analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel by both PCR and hybridization
methods applied to cell lines with various rearrangements of chromosome
1.

By interspecific backcross analysis, Welch et al. (1996) mapped the Scp2
gene to mouse chromosome 4.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with leukoencephalopathy, dystonia, and motor neuropathy
who was found to have deficiency of SCP2, Ferdinandusse et al. (2006)
identified a homozygous 1-nucleotide insertion (545_546insA;
184755.0001) in the SCP2 gene.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY WITH DYSTONIA AND MOTOR NEUROPATHY
SCP2, 1-BP INS, 545A

In a man with leukoencephalopathy with dystonia and motor neuropathy
(613724) and his similarly affected brother, Ferdinandusse et al. (2006)
found homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion of an adenine after nucleotide
position 545 (545_546insA) of the SCP2 gene, leading to a frameshift and
premature stop codon (I184fsX7).

;;ONCOGENE ERBB3;;
TYROSINE KINASE-TYPE CELL SURFACE RECEPTOR HER3; HER3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kraus et al. (1989) detected a DNA fragment related to but distinct from
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; 131550) and ERBB2 (164870). cDNA
cloning showed a predicted 148-kD transmembrane polypeptide with
structural features identifying it as a member of the ERBB gene family,
prompting the designation ERBB3. Markedly elevated ERBB3 mRNA levels
were demonstrated in certain human mammary tumor cell lines, suggesting
that it may play a role in some human malignancies just as does EGFR
(also called ERBB1).

GENE FUNCTION

Epidermal growth factor (131530), transforming growth factor alpha
(190170), and amphiregulin (104640) are structurally and functionally
related growth regulatory proteins. They all are secreted polypeptides
that bind to the 170-kD cell-surface EGF receptor, activating its
intrinsic kinase activity. Plowman et al. (1990) speculated that these 3
proteins may differentially interact with a homolog of EGFR. They failed
to show any interaction between these 3 secreted growth factors and
ERBB2, a known EGFR-related protein. Searching for other members of this
family of receptor tyrosine kinases, however, they cloned and studied
the expression of ERBB3, which they referred to as HER3. The cDNA was
isolated from a human carcinoma cell line, and its 6-kb transcript was
identified in various human tissues.

Carraway et al. (1994) demonstrated that ERBB3 is a receptor for
heregulin (NRG1; 142445) and is capable of mediating HGL-stimulated
tyrosine phosphorylation of itself.

Memon et al. (2004) used real-time PCR to quantify expression of NRG1,
NRG2 (603818), NRG3 (605533), and NRG4 (610894) and their receptors HER3
and HER4 (ERBB4; 600543) in biopsies from 88 bladder cancer patients.
They detected NRG4 expression in 91% of bladder cancer cases, with
significantly lower expression in biopsies of superficial invasive
tumors in comparison to superficial tumors, indicating early loss of
NRG4 expression during bladder cancer progression. NRG4 downregulation
was strongly correlated with stage, grade, and type of tumor. Increased
expression of HER3, HER4, and NRG4 correlated to better survival.
Coexpression of HER3 and HER4 with NRG4 showed even better correlation
with survival (p = 0.0034 and p = 0.0080, respectively).

Jones et al. (2006) used microarrays comprising virtually every Src
homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain encoded in the
human genome to measure the equilibrium dissociation constant of each
domain for 61 peptides representing physiologic sites of tyrosine
phosphorylation on the 4 ErbB receptors. By slicing through the network
at different affinity thresholds, Jones et al. (2006) found surprising
differences between the receptors. Most notably, EGFR and ErbB2 became
markedly more promiscuous as the threshold was lowered, whereas ErbB3
did not. Because EGFR and ErbB2 are overexpressed in many human cancers,
Jones et al. (2006) concluded that the extent to which promiscuity
changes with protein concentration may contribute to the oncogenic
potential of receptor tyrosine kinases.

In lung cancer specimens that had developed resistance to gefitinib,
Engelman et al. (2007) found that amplification of MET (164860) caused
gefitinib resistance by driving ERBB3-dependent activation of
phosphoinositide 3-kinase, a pathway thought to be specific to EGFR/ERBB
family receptors. Thus, Engelman et al. (2007) proposed that MET
amplification may promote drug resistance in other ERBB-driven cancers
as well.

Early social isolation results in adult behavioral and cognitive
dysfunction that correlates with white matter alterations. Makinodan et
al. (2012) showed that mice isolated for 2 weeks immediately after
weaning have alterations in prefrontal cortex function and myelination
that do not recover with reintroduction into a social environment. These
alterations, which occur only during this critical period, are
phenocopied by loss of oligodendrocyte ErbB3 receptors, and social
isolation leads to reduced expression of the ErbB3 ligand neuregulin-1
(142445). Makinodan et al. (2012) concluded that social experience
regulates prefrontal cortex myelination through neuregulin-1/ErbB3
signaling and that this is essential for normal cognitive function, thus
providing a cellular and molecular context to understand the
consequences of social isolation.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Cho and Leahy (2002) determined the 2.6-angstrom crystal structure of
the entire extracellular region of human HER3. The structure consists of
4 domains with structural homology to domains found in the type I
insulin-like growth factor receptor (147370). The HER3 structure
revealed a contact between domains II and IV that constrains the
relative orientations of ligand-binding domains and provides a
structural basis for understanding both multiple-affinity forms of EGFRs
and conformational changes induced in the receptor by ligand binding
during signaling.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Kraus et al. (1989) mapped the ERBB3 gene to
chromosome 12q13.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lethal congenital contracture syndrome type 2 (LCCS2; 607598), a
neonatally lethal form of arthrogryposis, originally described in 2
Israeli Bedouin kindreds, is characterized by multiple joint
contractures, anterior horn atrophy in the spinal cord, and a unique
feature of markedly distended urinary bladder. Narkis et al. (2007)
showed that the disorder is caused by aberrant splicing of ERBB3, which
leads to a predicted truncated protein. ERBB3, an activator of the
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt pathway, which regulates cell survival
and vesicle trafficking, is essential for the generation of precursors
of Schwann cells that normally accompany peripheral axons of motor
neurons. Gain-of-function mutations in members of the epidermal growth
factor tyrosine kinase receptor family are associated with predilection
to cancer; see ERBB2 (164870). This was the first report of a human
phenotype resulting from loss of function of a member of this group. The
human disorder is reminiscent of the phenotype of the null mutant of
this mouse ortholog. Most Erbb3-knockout embryos die before birth,
without Schwann cell precursors and Schwann cells that normally
accompany peripheral axons of sensory and motor neurons.

The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (2007) reported an
association between dbSNP rs2292239 in the ERBB3 gene and type 1
diabetes (222100) (p = 1.49 x 10(-9); OR, 1.30). In a study of 4,000
individuals with type 1 diabetes, 5,000 controls, and 2,997 family trios
independent of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (2007) study,
Todd et al. (2007) confirmed the previously reported association of
dbSNP rs2292239 (p = 3.83 x 10(-16); combined with WTCCC p = 1.52 x
10(-20)).

Barrett et al. (2009) reported the findings of a genomewide association
study of type 1 diabetes, combined in a metaanalysis with 2 previously
published studies (Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007; Cooper
et al., 2008). The total sample set included 7,514 cases and 9,045
reference samples. Using an analysis that combined comparisons over the
3 studies, they confirmed several previously reported associations,
including dbSNP rs2292239 at 12q13.2 (P = 2.2 x 10(-25)).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LETHAL CONGENITAL CONTRACTURE SYNDROME 2
ERBB3, IVS10, A-G, -8

In all affected members of a large Israeli Bedouin family with lethal
congenital contracture syndrome type 2 (LCCS2; 607598), and in an
affected individual from another family, Narkis et al. (2007) found a
homozygous A-to-G substitution 8 basepairs 5-prime of exon 11 of the
ERBB3 gene (IVS10-8A-G). The mutation caused an insertion of 8 basepairs
between exons 10 and 11 and resulted in frameshift and premature
termination, generating a 399-amino acid protein instead of the native
1,341 amino acids.

CLONING

Zhang et al. (2007) stated that CKMT1A differs from CKMT1B by only 2
nucleotides. The CKMT1A and CKMT1B proteins are identical, and both
appear to be functional.

MAPPING

Zhang et al. (2007) reported that the CKMT1A gene is telomeric to the
CKMT1B gene on chromosome 15q15.

;;ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR, MUSCARINIC, 1
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FAMILY

Goyal (1989) stated that 5 distinct but related muscarinic receptors had
been identified, with apparent molecular masses ranging from 51,452 to
66,127 kD. These glycosylated proteins have single chains of 460 to 590
amino acids that are thought to span the plasma membrane 7 times,
creating 4 extracellular domains, 7 helical hydrophobic transmembrane
domains, and 4 intracellular domains. Each protein is the product of a
different gene without introns in the coding sequence, and the amino
acid sequences in the receptor subtypes are remarkably homologous among
different animal species (Bonner et al., 1987; Peralta et al., 1987;
Bonner et al., 1988; Liao et al., 1989). The nomenclature is confusing
(Eglen and Whiting, 1986; Goyal, 1989). In structure and evolution,
muscarinic receptors are quite distinct from their pharmacologic kin,
the nicotinic receptors (see 100690, 100710, 100720, 100730).

MAPPING

By means of analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by both isotopic and
nonisotopic in situ hybridization, Bonner et al. (1991) assigned the
CHRM1 gene to 11q12-q13.

Courseaux et al. (1996) used a combination of methods to refine maps of
an approximately 5-Mb region of 11q13. They proposed the following gene
order:
cen--PGA--FTH1--UGB--AHNAK--ROM1--MDU1--CHRM1--COX8--EMK1--FKBP2--PLCB3--[PYGM,
ZFM1]--FAU--CAPN1--[MLK3, RELA]--FOSL1--SEA--CFL1--tel.

GENE FUNCTION

Cholinergic modulation of hippocampal and cortical function plays an
important role in memory and attention. The m1 muscarinic ACh receptor
is abundant in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Using pharmacologic
agents in rats, Marino et al. (1998) showed that the m1 receptor
modulates NMDA receptor-meditated excitatory synaptic transmission in
hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells.

Dean et al. (2002) tested the hypothesis that muscarinic receptors are
involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia by measuring CHRM1 and
CHRM4 (118495) protein and mRNA as well as [3H]pirenzepine binding in
Brodmann's area (BA) 9 and 40 obtained postmortem from 20 schizophrenic
and 20 age/sex-matched control subjects. They observed a significant
decrease in [3H]pirenzepine binding to BA 9 (p less than 0.02) but not
BA 40 from subjects with schizophrenia. The level of CHRM1 protein (p
less than 0.01) but not CHRM4 protein was decreased in BA 9 from
schizophrenic subjects but neither protein was altered in BA 40. The
level of CHRM1 mRNA was decreased in BA 9 (p less than 0.01) and BA 40
(p less than 0.01) from schizophrenic subjects, but CHRM4 mRNA was
decreased only in BA 40 (p less than 0.005). Dean et al. (2002)
interpreted the data as indicating that CHRM1 changes in the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may have a role in the pathology of
schizophrenia.

Seven-transmembrane receptor signaling is transduced by second
messengers such as diacylglycerol (DAG) generated in response to the
heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(q) (600998) and is
terminated by receptor desensitization and degradation of the second
messengers. Nelson et al. (2007) showed that beta-arrestins (see 107940)
coordinate both processes for the G(q)-coupled M1 muscarinic receptor
(CHRM1). Beta-arrestins physically interact with diacylglycerol kinases
(see 125855), enzymes that degrade DAG. Moreover, beta-arrestins are
essential for conversion of DAG to phosphatidic acid after agonist
stimulation, and this activity requires recruitment of the
beta-arrestin-DGK complex to activated 7-transmembrane receptors. The
dual function of beta-arrestins, limiting production of diacylglycerol
(by receptor desensitization) while enhancing its rate of degradation,
is analogous to their ability to recruit adenosine
3-prime,5-prime-monophosphate phosphodiesterases to G(s)
(139320)-coupled beta-2-adrenergic receptors (ADRB2; 109690). Thus,
Nelson et al. (2007) concluded that beta-arrestins can serve similar
regulatory functions for disparate classes of 7-transmembrane receptors
through structurally dissimilar enzymes that degrade chemically distinct
second messengers.

Knox et al. (2010) hypothesized that parasympathetic innervation is
required for epithelial progenitor cell function during organogenesis.
Removal of the parasympathetic ganglion in mouse explant organ culture
decreased the number and morphogenesis of keratin 5 (148040)-positive
epithelial progenitor cells. These effects were rescued with an
acetylcholine analog. Knox et al. (2010) demonstrated that acetylcholine
signaling, via the muscarinic M1 receptor and epidermal growth factor
receptor (131550), increased epithelial morphogenesis and proliferation
of the keratin 5-positive progenitor cells. Parasympathetic innervation
maintained the epithelial progenitor cell population in an
undifferentiated state, which was required for organogenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Anagnostaras et al. (2003) found that m1-null mice (m1 -/-) showed
normal or enhanced memory for tasks that involved matching-to-sample
problems and are hippocampus-dependent. In contrast, the null mice were
severely impaired in non-matching-to-sample tasks, working memory, and
consolidation, which require the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex.
The results suggested that the m1 receptor is involved in memory
processes in which the cortex and hippocampus interact.

607888	TITLE *607888 CKLF-LIKE MARVEL TRANSMEMBRANE DOMAIN-CONTAINING 5; CMTM5
;;CHEMOKINE-LIKE FACTOR SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 5; CKLFSF5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the chemokine-like factor superfamily, including CKLFSF5,
share similarity with both the chemokine (see 604852) and the
transmembrane 4 (see 300191) superfamilies of signaling molecules.

CLONING

By screening databases for sequences that share homology with
chemokine-like factor (CKLF), followed by RT-PCR of a brain cDNA
library, Han et al. (2003) cloned CKLFSF5. They also identified
alternatively spliced variants. One isoform encodes a 156-amino acid
protein with 4 transmembrane segments. CKLFSF5 shares about 40% sequence
identity with CKLFSF3 (607886). Northern blot analysis detected a
1.22-kb transcript and several minor transcripts expressed at high
levels in brain. Han et al. (2003) also cloned mouse Cklfsf5, which
shares about 90% sequence similarity with CKLFSF5.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Han et al. (2003) mapped the CKLFSF5 gene
to chromosome 14. They also mapped the mouse Cklfsf5 gene to chromosome
14.

601175	TITLE *601175 ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR-LIKE 2; ARL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The ARFs are small GTP-binding proteins of the RAS superfamily (see
ARF1, 103180). Clark et al. (1993) used degenerate PCR to clone human
ARL2, a member of a functionally distinct group of ARF-like genes. ARL2
encodes a 184-amino acid predicted protein that is 76% identical to ARF1
and about 40 to 45% identical to the Drosophila ARL proteins. Northern
blot analysis suggested ubiquitous transcription.

By immunohistochemical analysis of several mammalian cell lines,
including human, Zhou et al. (2006) found that ARL2 was expressed at
centrosomes, in cytoplasmic punctae, and in the nucleus. ARL2 localized
to centrosomes throughout the cell cycle, and its expression in other
structures was cell type specific.

GENE FUNCTION

Clark et al. (1993) found that recombinant ARL2 bound GTP rapidly.
However, guanine nucleotide exchange did not require phospholipids, a
characteristic of ARF proteins.

Bowzard et al. (2007) showed that both human ELMOD1 (615456) and ELMOD2
(610196), but not other ELMO domain-containing proteins, had GAP
activity toward ARL2.

Zhou et al. (2006) stated that ARL2 and ARL3 (604695) arose from a
common ancestor early in eukaryotic evolution and that they remain
highly related. However, they found that the 2 GTPases had distinct
effects on microtubule function in mammalian cells. Knockdown of ARL2 in
HeLa cells via RNA interference had little effect, but expression of
ARL2 with a dominant activating mutation caused failure of tubulin
polymerization, with loss of microtubules and microtubule-based mitotic
spindle, resulting in cell cycle arrest in M phase. In contrast,
knockdown of ARL3 using RNA interference changed HeLa cell morphology,
caused Golgi fragmentation, and increased acetylation of alpha-tubulin
(see 602259), which resulted in failure of cytokinesis and an elevated
number of binucleated cells. Overexpression of ARL3 had little effect.

The assembly of alpha/beta tubulin heterodimers requires the
participation of a series of chaperone proteins, some of which can
participate in the reverse microtubule-depolymerizing reaction. Using
HeLa cells, Tian et al. (2010) found that overexpression of the tubulin
chaperone TBCD (604649) caused microtubule depolymerization.
Coexpression of ARL2 inhibited microtubule depolymerization by
sequestering TBCD in an ARL2-TBCD interaction.

Using microarray analysis, quantitative PCR, and overexpression and
knockdown studies, Wang et al. (2011) found that binding of the microRNA
MIR16 (see 609704) to the 3-prime UTR of ARL2 caused downregulation of
ARL2 mRNA and protein expression in several human cell lines. MIR16
reduced proliferation and caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, at least in
part, through ARL2 downregulation. MIR16 also reduced cell migration,
but this effect was not mimicked by small interfering RNA directed
against ARL2.

Ismail et al. (2011) stated that PDE-delta (PDE6D; 602676) binds to
farnesylated small G proteins. They presented the 1.7-angstrom structure
of human PDE-delta in complex with C-terminally farnesylated human RHEB
(601293). PDE-delta interacted almost exclusively with the C-terminal
farnesyl moiety of RHEB, which was inserted within the farnesyl-binding
pocket of PDE-delta. The interaction did not require guanine nucleotide,
which bound RHEB on a surface nearly opposite to the PDE-delta-binding
site. PDE-delta also interacted with mouse Arl2. The interaction of
PDE-delta with Arl2 was dependent upon GTP and caused a conformational
change in PDE-delta that closed its farnesyl-binding pocket. In
solution, addition of Arl2-GTP dissociated the PDE-delta-farnesylated
RHEB complex. Addition of Arl3-GTP also caused release of farnesylated
RHEB from PDE-delta. In transfected canine kidney cells,
fluorescence-labeled RHEB showed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi
localization. Addition of PDE-delta relocalized RHEB into a cytoplasmic
and nuclear distribution, and subsequent addition of Arl2-GTP restored
RHEB localization to ER and Golgi membranes. Ismail et al. (2011)
concluded that PDE-delta functions as a solubilization factor for
farnesylated RHEB and that ARL2 and ARL3 act in a GTP-dependent manner
as allosteric release factors for farnesylated RHEB.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the ARL2 gene to chromosome 11q13.1 based on an
alignment of the ARL2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK L13687) with the genomic
sequence (GRCh37).

610488	TITLE *610488 TETRATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 9; TTC9
;;KIAA0227
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated myeloid leukemia
cell line cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned TTC9, which they
called KIAA0227. The deduced protein contains 336 amino acids. Northern
blot analysis detected TTC9 expression in all tissues examined, with
highest expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas.

Cao et al. (2006) determined that TTC9 encodes a predicted 222-amino
acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 24.4 kD. It has 3
C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domains and several potential
N-myristoylation sites, but no transmembrane domain. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.5-kb TTC9 transcript in a breast cancer cell line.
Northern blot analysis of several human tissues showed variable
expression of 2.5-, 5.1-, and 5.9-kb TTC9 transcripts. Expression of
TTC9 was highest in brain, followed by heart. Western blot analysis
revealed a 25-kD endogenous TTC9 protein in a breast cancer cell line.
Analysis of several normal tissues showed the 25-kD protein in all
tissues examined except liver. A doublet of 36 to 37 kD was also
expressed in brain. Cell fractionation experiments and
immunohistochemical analysis showed that TTC9 was predominantly
associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, although a small fraction was
cytoplasmic.

GENE FUNCTION

By microarray analysis, Cao et al. (2006) found that expression of TTC9
was regulated by progesterone in a breast cancer cell line expressing
progesterone receptor (PGR; 607311). They showed that TTC9 levels were
also regulated by estrogen, growth factors, and an inhibitor of p38
kinase (MAPK14; 600289). Growth factor-induced TTC9 expression was
inhibited by estrogen and abolished by an ERK (see 601795) inhibitor.
The hormonal effect on TTC9 expression was cell-line specific, and TTC9
appeared to be upregulated when the hormonal effect on cells was growth
inhibitory and downregulated when the hormonal effect was stimulatory.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid and human-rodent cell hybrid analyses, Nagase et al.
(1996) mapped the TTC9 gene to chromosome 14. Cao et al. (2006) stated
that the TTC9 gene maps to chromosome 14q24.2.

604481	TITLE *604481 SIRTUIN 3; SIRT3
;;SIR2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG-LIKE 3; SIR2L3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The sirtuin family of NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases and
mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases control a variety of cellular processes,
such as aging, metabolism, and gene silencing. SIRT3 functions as a
mitochondrial deacetylase (summary by Lombard et al., 2007).

CLONING

The yeast Sir2 (silent information regulator 2) protein (Shore et al.,
1984) regulates epigenetic gene silencing and, as a possible antiaging
effect, suppresses recombination of rDNA. Studies involving cobB, a
bacterial Sir2-like gene, have suggested that Sir2 may encode a pyridine
nucleotide transferase. By in silico and PCR cloning techniques, Frye
(1999) obtained cDNA sequences encoding 5 human Sir2-like genes, which
they called sirtuin-1 to -5 (SIRT1 to SIRT5). The SIRT1 (604479)
sequence has the closest homology to the S. cerevisiae Sir2 protein,
while SIRT4 (604482) and SIRT5 (604483) more closely resemble
prokaryotic sirtuin sequences. PCR analysis showed that the 5 human
sirtuins are widely expressed in fetal and adult tissues.

By PCR of a human spleen cDNA library, Schwer et al. (2002) cloned
SIRT3. The deduced 399-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal
mitochondrial targeting signal and a central catalytic domain.
Fluorescence-tagged SIRT3 localized to mitochondria of transfected HeLa
cells. Western blot analysis of human embryonic kidney cells detected
endogenous SIRT3 peptides of about 44 and 28 kD.

Using immunofluorescence analysis, Scher et al. (2007) showed that
full-length SIRT3 localized to both HeLa cell nuclei and mitochondria.

By Western blot analysis of mouse tissues, Lombard et al. (2007) found
that Sirt3 was highly expressed in mitochondria-rich tissues: brain,
heart, liver, and brown adipose tissue. Subcellular fractionation
revealed that Sirt3 localized to mitochondria.

GENE FUNCTION

Tanny et al. (1999) showed that the yeast Sir2 protein can transfer
labeled phosphate from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to itself and
histones in vitro. A modified form of Sir2, which results from its
automodification activity, was specifically recognized by
anti-mono-ADP-ribose antibodies, suggesting that Sir2 is an
ADP-ribosyltransferase. Mutation of a phylogenetically invariant
histidine (his364 to tyr) in Sir2 abolished both its enzymatic activity
in vitro and its silencing functions in vivo. However, the mutant
protein was associated with chromatin and other silencing factors in a
manner similar to wildtype Sir2. These findings suggested that Sir2
contains an ADP-ribosyltransferase activity that is essential for its
silencing function.

Although the SIRT3 gene, located in a large imprinted gene domain on
11p15.5, is not imprinted, Onyango et al. (2002) found that it is
localized to mitochondria, with a mitochondrial targeting signal within
a unique N-terminal peptide sequence. The encoded protein was found also
to possess NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase activity. These results
suggested a previously unrecognized organelle for sirtuin function and a
role for SIRT3 in mitochondria involving protein deacetylation.

Schwer et al. (2002) assayed endogenous SIRT3 in the mitochondrial
fraction of human embryonic kidney cells and found that it had specific
NAD-dependent deacetylase activity. Mitochondrial import of SIRT3
depended on an N-terminal amphipathic alpha helix rich in basic
residues. SIRT3 was proteolytically processed in the mitochondrial
matrix to a 28-kD product, and this processing was reconstituted in
vitro with recombinant mitochondrial matrix processing peptidase (MPP;
see 603131). Mutation analysis showed that SIRT3 was cleaved between
arg99 and arg100. The unprocessed form of SIRT3 was enzymatically
inactive and became fully activated in vitro after cleavage by MPP.

Scher et al. (2007) showed that both the full-length and processed forms
of SIRT3 had strong NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylation activity in
vitro, with specificity for lys16 of H4 (see 602822) and, to a lesser
extent, lys9 of H3 (see 602810). SIRT3 could repress transcription of a
target gene in vivo when recruited to its promoter. Full-length SIRT3
was transported from the nucleus to the mitochondria following cell
stresses, such as DNA damage and ultraviolet irradiation, as well as by
SIRT3 overexpression. Transport was inhibited by leptomycin B, a nuclear
export inhibitor.

MAPPING

Frye (1999) stated that the SIRT3 gene is contained within a YAC clone
(GenBank GENBANK AF015416) from the 11p15.5 region.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bellizzi et al. (2005) identified a variable number of tandem repeats
(VNTR) polymorphism of a 72-bp repeat core in intron 5 of the SIRT3
gene. Alleles differed both in the number of repeats and in the presence
of either a GATA3 (131320) or a delta-EF1 (TCF8; 189909) regulatory
site. Transient transfection experiments demonstrated that the VNTR
region has allele-specific enhancer activity. Bellizzi et al. (2005)
analyzed allele frequencies as a function of age in a sample of 945
individuals between 20 and 106 years of age and found that the allele
completely lacking enhancer activity was virtually absent in males older
than 90 years. The association between VNTR alleles and longevity was
restricted to males, because no difference was observed either in the
genotypic or in the allelic pool between females of younger or older
ages.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lombard et al. (2007) found that Sirt3 -/- mice were born at the
expected mendelian ratio, developed normally, and were indistinguishable
from wildtype. Sirt3 -/- mice were metabolically unremarkable under both
fed and fasted conditions, and they showed normal adaptive
thermogenesis.

Ahn et al. (2008) found that Sirt3 -/- mice appeared indistinguishable
from wildtype mice. However, heart, kidney, and liver of Sirt3 -/- mice,
as well as Sirt3 -/- embryonic fibroblasts, showed reduced basal ATP
levels. In the absence of Sirt3, multiple components of complex I of the
electron transport chain demonstrated increased acetylation.
Mitochondria from Sirt3 -/- mice displayed selective inhibition of
complex I activity, and incubation of exogenous Sirt3 with mutant
mitochondria augmented complex I activity. Ahn et al. (2008) concluded
that SIRT3 regulates and maintains basal ATP levels.

In mice, Hirschey et al. (2010) demonstrated that Sirt3 expression is
upregulated during fasting in liver and brown adipose tissues. During
fasting, livers from mice lacking Sirt3 had higher levels of fatty acid
oxidation intermediate products and triglycerides, associated with
decreased levels of fatty acid oxidation, compared to livers from
wildtype mice. Mass spectrometry of mitochondrial proteins showed that
Lcad (609576) was hyperacetylated at lysine-42 in the absence of Sirt3.
Lcad was deacetylated in wildtype mice under fasted conditions and by
Sirt3 in vitro and in vivo; and hyperacetylation of Lcad reduced its
enzymatic activity. Mice lacking Sirt3 exhibited hallmarks of fatty acid
oxidation disorders during fasting, including reduced ATP levels and
intolerance to cold exposure. Hirschey et al. (2010) concluded that
their findings identified acetylation as a novel regulatory mechanism
for mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and demonstrated that Sirt3
modulates mitochondrial intermediary metabolism and fatty acid use
during fasting.

Someya et al. (2010) demonstrated that caloric restriction in wildtype
mice reduced oxidative DNA damage in multiple tissues and prevented
age-related hearing loss. In contrast, these phenotypes were not
modified by caloric restriction in Sirt3-null mice. Cellular studies
indicated that SIRT3 directly deacetylated and thus activated isocitrate
dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2; 147650), an enzyme that converts NADP+ to NADPH
in mitochondria. In response to caloric restriction, SIRT3 stimulated
IDH2 activity, leading to increased levels of NADPH and increased levels
of reduced glutathione, which is the major antioxidant defense system in
the cell. Overexpression of SIRT3 and/or IDH2 increased NADPH levels and
protected cultured cells from oxidative stress. The findings provided
conclusive evidence that caloric-mediated reduction of oxidative damage
and prevention of a common age-related phenotype require a member of the
sirtuin family in mammals.

114780	TITLE *114780 CARBONIC ANHYDRASE VI; CA6
;;CA VI;;
CARBONIC ANHYDRASE, SECRETED;;
GUSTIN
DESCRIPTION Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are a family of zinc metalloenzymes. For
background information on the CA family, see 114800.

CA VI is a 42-kD secreted isozyme found in salivary glands and saliva
(Murakami and Sly, 1987). By using biochemical and immunohistochemical
techniques, Karhumaa et al. (2001) demonstrated that CA VI is also an
elementary component of milk.

Aldred et al. (1991) isolated and sequenced cDNA clones coding for CA6.
The clones identified a 1.45-kb mRNA that was present in high levels in
parotid submandibular salivary glands but absent in other tissues such
as sublingual gland, kidney, liver, and prostate. The cDNA encoded a
protein of 308 amino acids that included a 17-amino acid leader sequence
typical of secreted proteins. The mature CA VI protein has 291 amino
acids, compared to the 259 or 260 residues of the cytoplasmic isozymes;
most of the extra amino acids present are in the carboxyl terminal
region. CA VI has diverged significantly in its structure from the
cytoplasmic isozymes, including CA I (114800), CA II (611492), and CA
III (114750), which are closely related to one another. The CA VI
protein has 35% sequence identity with human CA II, while residues
involved in the active site of the enzymes have been conserved. Southern
analysis of human DNA indicated that there is only 1 gene coding for CA
VI.

Thatcher et al. (1998) identified gustin as CA6. Gustin contains 2
potential N-linked glycosylation sites. By RP-HPLC and SDS-PAGE, gustin
purified from human saliva had a molecular mass of 37 kD before
deglycosylation and 33 kD after.

Karhumaa et al. (2001) showed that the 42-kD CA VI glycopolypeptide
purified from human milk shares 100% homology with salivary CA VI in
protein sequence. They found that its concentration is approximately 8
times higher in human colostrum than in mature milk, the latter
corresponding to the levels previously detected in human saliva. The
high concentration in colostrum, in particular its functional and
structural stability in an acidic milieu, and its growth-supporting role
in the taste buds suggest that milk CA VI is an essential factor in
normal growth and development of the infant alimentary tract.

By means of Southern analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and by in
situ hybridization, Sutherland et al. (1989) mapped the CA6 gene to
1p36.33-p36.22. White et al. (1998) reported physical mapping of the
CA6, ENO1 (172430), and SLC2A5 (138230) genes to 1p36 by study of yeast-
and P1-artificial chromosome (YAC and PAC) contigs. PACs from the contig
were mapped to 1p36.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

610447	TITLE *610447 SHADOW OF PRION PROTEIN; SPRN
;;SHADOO;;
SHO
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching for zebrafish prion protein (PrP; 176640)
homologs, Premzl et al. (2003) identified, and subsequently cloned, a
novel zebrafish cDNA, SPRN (shadow of PrP), encoding a protein
designated shadoo (Sho). Further database searches revealed
well-conserved orthologs in other fish (Fugu and tetraodon) and in
mammals (human, mouse, and rat) (Premzl et al., 2003, 2004). The deduced
human protein contains 151 amino acids (Premzl et al., 2003). The
mammalian proteins share 81 to 95% sequence identity. Alignment of all
fish and mammalian Sho proteins showed that all have an N-terminal
peptide sequence with an endoplasmic reticulum targeting signal for
extracellular transport, a basic RG-rich region, a hydrophobic stretch
in the middle of the protein that contains the same unusual composition
of small aliphatic residues (GAV) as PrP and PrP-like proteins, and a
C-terminal region with a putative N-glycosylation site and a possible
GPI anchor site (Premzl et al., 2003, 2004). Database searches revealed
that SPRN is expressed in mouse and rat embryo, brain, and retina, in
human hippocampus, and in zebrafish embryo and retina. Using RT-PCR,
Premzl et al. (2003) confirmed SPRN expression in human, rat, and mouse
brain. RT-PCR of rat cDNA from multiple tissues indicated that SPRN is
almost exclusively expressed in brain, with faint expression in lung and
stomach. Phylogenetic footprinting on aligned human, mouse, and Fugu
SPRN genes detected 16 conserved motifs, 3 of which are known
transcription factor-binding sites for a receptor and transcription
factors specific to or associated with expression in the brain (Premzl
et al., 2004), suggesting an important function in this tissue.

EVOLUTION

Premzl et al. (2003, 2004) found that conservation of the SPRN-coding
exon between mammals and fish satisfied the criteria for gene orthology.
They noted that the gene order and orientation of SPRN and 2 proximal
genes, an amine oxidase and a GTP-binding protein (MTG1), indicated that
no rearrangement occurred in this genomic fragment after the
evolutionary divergence of mammals and fish 450 million years ago.

Premzl et al. (2004) found that the gene density and GC content are much
higher in the SPRN genomic environment than in the PRNP (PrP)
environment. In addition, in contrast to genes encoding members of the
PrP family, SPRN contains no transposable elements. Premzl et al. (2004)
suggested that this may be the result of functional selection.

GENE STRUCTURE

Premzl et al. (2003) determined that the zebrafish, mouse, and human
SPRN genes all contain 2 exons, with the ORF contained entirely within
exon 2.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Premzl et al. (2003) mapped the human SPRN gene to
chromosome 10q26.3 and the mouse gene to chromosome 7. Premzl et al.
(2004) found an apparent duplication of the human SPRN gene about 140 kb
downstream of SPRN.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Beck et al. (2008) presented evidence that variation in the SPRN gene
may be associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD; 123400). Two of
107 patients with variant CJD were found to have a 1-bp insertion in the
SPRN gene, which was not identified in 861 controls (p = 0.01). The 1-bp
insertion in codon 46 was predicted to result in frameshift and a
putative 294-amino acid protein if translation occurred; however, the
authors were unable to show whether the transcript exists. In addition,
2 linked SNPs, -11A-G and 20T-C, in the SPRN gene were associated with
risk of sporadic CJD (p = 0.009). The findings supported the hypothesis
that SPRN variants may be involved in prion disease.

120580	TITLE *120580 COMPLEMENT COMPONENT 1, s SUBCOMPONENT; C1S
;;COMPLEMENT COMPONENT C1s
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

MacKinnon et al. (1987) derived the complete amino acid sequence of C1s
from molecular cloning of cDNA. Tosi et al. (1987) presented the
complete cDNA sequence of C1s. Kusumoto et al. (1988) found that the
amino acid sequence of C1s was 40.5% identical to that of C1r (216950),
with excellent matches of tentative disulfide bond locations conserving
the overall domain structure of C1r.

MAPPING

By means of a cDNA in somatic cell hybrids, Cohen-Haguenauer et al.
(1986) assigned the C1S and C1R (216950) genes to chromosome 12.

Leppert et al. (1987) found a maximum lod score of 5.99 at theta = 0.038
for linkage between C1S and one of the PRP loci (see 168710); the
maximum lod score between C1R and another PRP locus was 4.21 at theta =
0.001. Although C1r and C1s are structurally and functionally similar,
with a significant degree of sequence homology suggesting origin by gene
duplication, cDNA probes for human C1r and C1s do not cross-hybridize
even at mild stringency conditions and are therefore gene-specific.

Using a panel of human-rodent cell hybrids, Van Cong et al. (1988)
independently assigned the C1r and C1s genes to chromosome 12. In situ
hybridization confirmed these assignments and localized the genes to
12p13.

By hybridization of C1r and C1s probes to restriction endonuclease
fragments of genomic DNA, Tosi et al. (1987) demonstrated close physical
linkage of the genes. This finding was consistent with their evolution
through tandem gene duplication and was also consistent with the
previously observed combined hereditary deficiencies of C1r and C1s (see
216950). Their coordinate expression may depend on the close linkage.
The 2 genes lie in a DNA stretch not longer than 50 kb.

By DNA blotting and sequencing analyses of genomic DNA and of an
isolated genomic DNA clone, Kusumoto et al. (1988) showed that the C1r
and C1s genes are closely located in a 'tail-to-tail' arrangement at a
distance of about 9.5 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Inoue et al. (1998) reported a patient with selective C1s deficiency
(613783) resulting from a homozygous mutation in the C1S gene
(120580.0001).

In a 27-month-old girl with multiple autoimmune diseases, Dragon-Durey
et al. (2001) detected selective C1S deficiency (613783) resulting from
a homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 12 of the C1S gene (120580.0002).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
C1s DEFICIENCY
C1S, 4-BP DEL, NT1087

In a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome and chronic
glomerulonephritis, Inoue et al. (1998) reported the molecular basis of
selective C1s deficiency (613783). No C1s protein was detectable by
immunoblot. By Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis, C1s mRNA was of
appropriate size, but only 10% of the level detected in HCS2/8, a human
chondrosarcoma cell line. Levels of beta-actin and C1r mRNA were similar
to levels detected in HCS2/8. The patient was homozygous for a 4-bp
deletion in exon 10 of the C1S gene, 1087-1090delTTTG. This deletion
resulted in a premature termination codon 94 bp downstream.

.0002
C1s DEFICIENCY
C1S, ARG534TER

In a 27-month-old girl with multiple autoimmune diseases, Dragon-Durey
et al. (2001) determined that an absence of plasma C1s (613783)
accounted for a lack of classic complement (CH50) pathway activity.
Microsatellite and sequence analyses revealed a C-to-T transition in
codon 534 in exon 12 of the C1S gene, resulting in an arg-to-ter
substitution and premature termination. DNA analysis indicated that both
parents were heterozygous for the mutation. Restriction enzyme analysis
showed that the propositus was homozygous for the mutation, while a
paternal grandmother, maternal grandfather, and aunts on both sides of
the family were heterozygous. The mutation was not detected in systemic
lupus erythematosus (152700) patients or unrelated Caucasian controls,
including some from the same geographic region. At age 5, the child was
alive and well while receiving immunosuppressive drugs daily and
penicillin.

CLONING

P23 was first observed as a component of the unactivated avian
progesterone receptor complex, along with HSP70 (see 140550) and HSP90
(see 140571) (Smith et al., 1990). Using the chicken p23 sequence as
probe, Johnson et al. (1994) cloned P23 from a human testis cDNA
library. The deduced 160-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 19 kD and contains several putative phosphorylation sites.
P23 shares about 96% sequence identity with the chicken homolog. Western
blot analysis revealed a 23-kD band in tissue and cell lysates from
several mammalian species including human.

GENE FUNCTION

Freeman and Yamamoto (2002) determined that the P23 molecular chaperone
localizes to genomic response elements in a hormone-dependent manner and
showed that it could disrupt receptor-mediated transcriptional
activation.

Synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from arachidonic acid involves
multiple enzymes, and 2 isoforms of the terminal enzyme of this
biosynthetic pathway, PGE synthase (PGES), have been identified.
Cytosolic PTGES (cPGES) is identical to the heat-shock protein-90 (see
140571) chaperone p23 (Tanioka et al., 2000) and is functionally coupled
to constitutive prostaglandin-endoperoxide H synthase-1 (176805) (Han et
al., 2002). Microsomal PTGES (mPGES; 605172) is inducible by
proinflammatory cytokines such as IL1B (147720). Meadows et al. (2003)
studied expression and localization of both enzyme isoforms in human
fetal membranes either at term or preterm, with or without labor.
Western blot analysis of the amnion and choriodecidua showed no
differences in amounts of either cPGES or mPGES at term or preterm, with
or without labor, in either tissue with advancing gestation. Meadows et
al. (2003) concluded that expression of PGES is not the rate-limiting
step in PGE2 synthesis in fetal membranes at labor.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the P23
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP SHGC-35709).

180231	TITLE *180231 RETINOIC ACID-BINDING PROTEIN, CELLULAR, TYPE II; CRABP2
DESCRIPTION CRABP2 is highly expressed in human skin. Giguere et al. (1990) isolated
a cDNA encoding mouse Crabp-2 by a low stringency cloning strategy using
a probe from previously cloned CRABP1 cDNA (180230). MacGregor et al.
(1992) determined the genomic organization of the murine Crabp-2 gene
and performed a detailed analysis of its transcriptional unit. It was
shown to be approximately 4.6 kb long and divided into 4 exons in a
structure common to other members of the family of serum and cellular
retinoid-binding proteins. The chromosomal location of the Crabp-2 locus
was determined by interspecific backcross analysis using progeny derived
from matings of C57BL/6J and M. spretus. Mapping results indicated that
the gene is located on mouse chromosome 2 linked to muscle nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor alpha-chain (Acra) and catalase-1 (Cas-1).
MacGregor et al. (1992) suggested that the human homolog is located on
2q or 11p. Elder et al. (1992) localized the CRABP2 gene to 1q21 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Localization was confirmed by
hybridization of a CRABP2 cDNA clone against a human/mouse hybrid cell
line containing a t(1;6)(q21;q13) translocation chromosome.

Flagiello et al. (1997) mapped CRABP2 to 1q21.3 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

601568	TITLE *601568 ADDUCIN 3; ADD3
;;ADDUCIN, GAMMA;;
ADDUCIN-LIKE; ADDL
ADD3/NUP98 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

From a human fetal-brain cDNA library, Katagiri et al. (1996) isolated a
novel human cDNA which they termed adducin-like 70. The predicted amino
acid sequence shows a high degree of homology to adducins alpha (102680)
and beta (102681). In human erythrocytes, adducin is a 200-kD
heterodimeric skeletal component of the cell membrane, where it promotes
the binding of spectrin to actin. This binding is regulated by
calcium/calmodulin (114180). Adducin also is phosphorylated by protein
kinase C. Adducin and its multiple isoforms represent a family of
proteins present in a variety of tissues and cultured cell lines,
including those from brain, kidney, and liver. The gene, symbolized here
ADDL, contains an open reading frame of 2,022 nucleotides encoding 674
amino acids. It shows 54%, 53%, and 59% identity in predicted amino acid
sequence with alpha and beta components of human adducin and rat adducin
63, respectively. Katagiri et al. (1996) stated that human adducin-like
70 is likely to play an important role in the skeletal organization of
the cell membrane. Northern blot analysis indicated ubiquitous
expression of this gene in adult human tissues.

In a comprehensive assay of gene expression, Gilligan et al. (1999)
showed the ubiquitous expression of alpha- and gamma-adducin, in
contrast to the restricted expression of beta-adducin. Beta-adducin was
expressed at high levels in brain and hematopoietic tissues (bone marrow
in humans, spleen in mice).

By RT-PCR of peripheral blood leukocyte RNA, Citterio et al. (1999)
identified a splice variant of ADD3 that includes exon 13. The deduced
706-amino acid protein contains 32 additional amino acids in its
C-terminal tail compared with the protein described by Katagiri et al.
(1996). RT-PCR detected both splice variants in kidney, brain, lung, and
heart.

GENE STRUCTURE

Citterio et al. (1999) determined that the ADD3 gene contains 14 coding
exons and spans over 20 kb.

MAPPING

Katagiri et al. (1996) localized the gene to chromosome 10q24.2-q24.3 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. By radiation hybrid analysis,
Citterio et al. (1999) mapped the ADD3 gene to chromosome 10q24.1-q24.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lanzani et al. (2005) analyzed the ADD3 gene in 40 unrelated individuals
and identified a +386A-G polymorphism (dbSNP rs3731366) in intron 11.
The authors then genotyped 512 newly discovered and never-treated
hypertensive patients (see 145500) for IVS11+386A-G, but found no
association between the polymorphism and ambulatory blood pressure or
plasma levels of renin activity and endogenous ouabain. However,
carriers of a 460W polymorphism in the ADD1 gene (102680.0001) who also
carried the ADD3 G allele had an approximately 8 mm Hg greater increase
in blood pressure than those who carried the ADD3 A allele (p = 0.020 to
0.006, depending on the genetic model applied). Lanzani et al. (2005)
suggested that there were epistatic effects between the ADD1 and ADD3
loci affecting variation in blood pressure.

CYTOGENETICS

- ADD3/NUP98 Fusion Gene

Lahortiga et al. (2003) described a translocation t(10;11)(q25;p15) that
resulted in fusion of the ADD3 gene to the NUP98 gene (601021) on
chromosome 11p15 and development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

614177	TITLE *614177 EF-HAND CALCIUM-BINDING DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 4A; EFCAB4A
;;CALCIUM RELEASE-ACTIVATED CALCIUM CHANNEL REGULATOR 2B; CRACR2B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a human database for sequences similar to CRACR2A (EFCAB4B;
614178), followed by RT-PCR of Jurkat human T cells, Srikanth et al.
(2010) cloned EFCAB4A, which they called CRACR2B. The deduced 399-amino
acid protein contains 2 N-terminal EF hand motifs and a C-terminal
coiled-coil domain. Mouse and human EFCAB4A share 36% overall identity,
with highest similarity in the EF-hand motifs and coiled-coil domain.
Quantitative RT-PCR revealed variable EFCAB4A expression in all human
tissues and cell lines examined, with highest expression in lung and
lower expression in HEK293 cells, Jurkat cells, spleen, placenta, and
kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

ORAI1 (610277) and STIM1 (605921) are critical components of calcium
release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels involved in store-operated
calcium entry into cells. Srikanth et al. (2010) found that EFCAB4B was
a calcium-binding protein that regulated CRAC channel activity.
Depletion of EFCAB4B from Jurkat T cells, more so than from HEK293
cells, decreased store-operated calcium entry. In contrast, depletion of
EFCAB4A had a stronger effect on store-operated calcium entry in HEK293
cells than in Jurkat T cells. These effects correlated with relatively
higher EFCAB4B expression in Jurkat cells and higher EFCAB4A expression
in HEK293 cells. Depletion and restoration studies revealed functional
redundancy between EFCAB4B and EFCAB4A.

GENE STRUCTURE

Srikanth et al. (2010) determined that the EFCAB4A gene contains at
least 9 exons.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the EFCAB4A gene to chromosome 11p15.5 based on an
alignment of the EFCAB4B sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC033196) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

606493	TITLE *606493 EXOSOME COMPONENT 1; EXOSC1
;;CSL4, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; CSL4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Inherently unstable mammalian mRNAs contain AU-rich elements (AREs)
within their 3-prime untranslated regions. In yeast, 3-prime-to-5-prime
mRNA degradation is mediated by the exosome, a multisubunit particle.
Chen et al. (2001) purified and characterized the human exosome by mass
spectrometry and found its composition to be similar to its yeast
counterpart. They identified the following protein subunits within the
human exosome: p7, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp4 protein
(602238); p8, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp42 protein (606488);
p9, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp43 protein (OIP2; 606019); p10,
which is homologous to the yeast Rrp40 protein (606489); p11, which is
homologous to the yeast Mtr3 protein (606490); p12A, which is homologous
to the yeast Rrp41 protein (606491); p12B, which is homologous to the
yeast Rrp46 protein (606492); and p13, which is homologous to the yeast
Csl4 protein. They also identified 2 exosome-associated factors, p1
(600478) and p14 (MPP6; 605500), that were not homologous to any yeast
exosome components.

Raijmakers et al. (2002) stated that the CSL4 protein contains 195 amino
acids and has a molecular mass of 21 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a cell-free RNA decay system, Chen et al. (2001) demonstrated that
the mammalian exosome is required for rapid degradation of
ARE-containing RNAs but not for poly(A) shortening. They found that the
mammalian exosome does not recognize ARE-containing RNAs on its own. ARE
recognition required certain ARE-binding proteins that could interact
with the exosome and recruit it to unstable RNAs, thereby promoting
their rapid degradation.

Using mammalian 2-hybrid and GST pull-down analyses, Raijmakers et al.
(2002) found that the CSL4 protein, but not mutant forms lacking N- or
C-terminal residues, interacted directly with RRP42 and RRP46. The
deletion mutants were also unable to interact with the exosome. RRP42
and RRP46 did not interact with each other.
