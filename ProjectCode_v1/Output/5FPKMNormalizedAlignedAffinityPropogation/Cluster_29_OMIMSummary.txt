;;GKRP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Glucokinase (GCK; 138079) in the liver and pancreatic beta cells is
subject to inhibition by a regulatory protein, GCKR. The inhibitory
effect of GCKR depends on the presence of fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) and
is antagonized by fructose-1-phosphate (F1P). Warner et al. (1995) noted
that mutations in GCKR might be diabetogenic if they resulted in the
synthesis of proteins with increased inhibitory activity, perhaps
reflecting increased sensitivity to fructose-6-phosphate or reduced
susceptibility to antagonism by fructose-1-phosphate. Warner et al.
(1995) determined the complete sequence of human GCKR cDNA. The GCKR
cDNA encodes a protein of 625 amino acids. Given the role of glucokinase
in the causation of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) type II
(125851), GCKR had been considered a candidate gene for a form of MODY.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hayward et al. (1998) determined that the GCKR gene contains 19 exons
and spans 27 kb.

MAPPING

Warner et al. (1995) isolated YAC clones containing human GCKR and
localized them to chromosome 2p23 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Vaxillaire et al. (1994) had previously assigned the GCKR gene to
chromosome 2p23-p22.3.

Hayward et al. (1996) demonstrated that the GCKR gene lies within 500 kb
of the gene encoding ketohexokinase (229800). By high-resolution
fluorescence in situ hybridization, they refined the localization of the
GCKR gene to chromosome 2p23.3-p23.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

A common GCKR variant (P446L; dbSNP rs1260326; 600842.0001) is
associated with triglyceride and fasting plasma glucose levels (FGQTL5;
613463) in the general population. In a series of transfection
experiments using wildtype and P446L-GKRP, Beer et al. (2009) reported
reduced regulation by physiologic concentrations of F6P in the presence
of P446L-GKRP, resulting indirectly in increased GCK activity. Assays
matched for GKRP activity demonstrated no difference in dose-dependent
inhibition of GCK activity or F1P-mediated regulation. Quantitative
RT-PCR analysis showed that GCKR is highly expressed relative to GCK in
human liver and has very low expression in human pancreatic islets
relative to GCK. The authors noted that altered GCK regulation in liver
is predicted to enhance glycolytic flux, promoting hepatic glucose
metabolism and elevating concentrations of malonyl-CoA (a substrate for
de novo lipogenesis). Beer et al. (2009) proposed this as a mutational
mechanism for the association of the leu446 allele with raised
triglycerides and lower glucose levels.

Suhre et al. (2011) reported a comprehensive analysis of
genotype-dependent metabolic phenotypes using a GWAS with nontargeted
metabolomics. They identified 37 genetic loci associated with blood
metabolite concentrations, of which 25 showed effect sizes that were
unusually high for GWAS and accounted for 10 to 60% differences in
metabolite levels per allele copy. These associations provided new
functional insights for many disease-related associations that had been
reported in previous studies, including those for cardiovascular and
kidney disorders, type 2 diabetes, cancer, gout, venous thromboembolism,
and Crohn disease. Suhre et al. (2011) identified dbSNP rs780094 in the
GCKR gene as associated with glucose/mannose ratio with a p value value
of 5.5 x 10(-53).

ANIMAL MODEL

To further understand the role of glucokinase regulatory protein, which
they symbolized GKRP, Farrelly et al. (1999) inactivated the mouse
homolog. With the knockout of the mouse gene, there was a parallel loss
of glucokinase protein and activity in mutant mouse liver. The loss was
primarily because of posttranscriptional regulation of glucokinase,
indicating a positive regulatory role for GKRP in maintaining
glucokinase levels and activity. As in rat hepatocytes, both glucokinase
and GKRP were localized in the nuclei of mouse hepatocytes cultured in
low glucose-containing medium. In the presence of fructose or high
concentrations of glucose, conditions known to relieve glucokinase
inhibition by GKRP in vitro, only glucokinase was translocated into the
cytoplasm. In the GKRP-mutant hepatocytes, glucokinase was not found in
the nucleus under any tested conditions. Farrelly et al. (1999) proposed
that GKRP functions as an anchor to sequester and inhibit glucokinase in
the hepatocyte nucleus, where it is protected from degradation. This
ensures that glucose phosphorylation is minimal when the liver is in the
fasting, glucose-producing phase. This also enables the hepatocytes
rapidly to mobilize glucokinase into the cytoplasm to phosphorylate and
store or metabolize glucose after the ingestion of dietary glucose. In
GKRP-mutant mice, the disruption of this regulation and the subsequent
decrease in GK activity led to altered glucose metabolism and impaired
glycemic control.

Grimsby et al. (2000) found that wildtype and Gckr-null mice had
comparable glucokinase activity at physiologic glucose concentrations.
However, following a glucose tolerance test, the homozygous knockout
mice showed impaired glucose clearance, indicating that they could not
recruit sufficient glucokinase due to the absence of a nuclear reserve.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE LEVEL QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCUS 5
GCKR, PRO446LEU (dbSNP rs1260326)

Beer et al. (2009) noted that the 1403C-T transition (dbSNP rs1260326)
in the GCKR gene results in a pro446-to-leu (P446L) substitution at a
conserved residue in the glucokinase regulatory protein. Residue 446
lies between 2 motifs thought to be directly involved in binding of
phosphate esters.

By genomewide association studies, Orho-Melander et al. (2008) showed
that the intronic dbSNP rs780094 variant of the GCKR gene was associated
with higher plasma triglyceride levels (p = 3 x 10(-56)) but lower
fasting plasma glucose levels (p = 1 x 10(-13)) (FGQTL5; 613463).
Fine-mapping by genotyping and imputing SNPs across the GCKR locus
identified a common 1403C-T transition, resulting in a pro446-to-leu
(P446L; dbSNP rs1260326) substitution, as the strongest signal for
association with triglycerides. The dbSNP rs1260326 SNP shows strong
linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 0.93) with dbSNP rs780094 and has a minor
allele frequency of 0.34.

In 4,833 middle-aged French individuals, Vaxillaire et al. (2008) found
that the minor T allele of the P446L (dbSNP rs1260326) SNP was strongly
associated with lower fasting glucose levels and fasting insulin levels,
and conversely, higher triglyceride levels.

Dupuis et al. (2010) performed metaanalyses of 21 genomewide association
studies informative for fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and indices of
beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in up to
46,186 nondiabetic participants. Follow-up of 25 loci in up to 76,558
additional subjects identified 16 loci associated with fasting glucose
and HOMA-B and 2 loci associated with fasting insulin and HOMA-IR.
Dupuis et al. (2010) identified association of elevation of fasting
blood glucose (p = 5.6 x 10(-38)) and decreased triglyceride levels (p =
9.6 x 10(-17)) with the C allele of the intronic C-T SNP (dbSNP
rs780094) in the GCKR gene on chromosome 2p23.3-p23.2. This variant was
also associated with fasting insulin levels (3.0 x 10(-24)).

In a series of transfection experiments using wildtype and P446L-GKRP,
Beer et al. (2009) reported reduced regulation by physiologic
concentrations of F6P in the presence of P446L-GKRP, resulting
indirectly in increased GCK activity. Assays matched for GKRP activity
demonstrated no difference in dose-dependent inhibition of GCK activity
or F1P-mediated regulation. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that
GCKR is highly expressed relative to GCK in human liver and has very low
expression in human pancreatic islets relative to GCK. The authors noted
that altered GCK regulation in liver is predicted to enhance glycolytic
flux, promoting hepatic glucose metabolism and elevating concentrations
of malonyl-CoA (a substrate for de novo lipogenesis). Beer et al. (2009)
proposed this as a mutational mechanism for the association of the
leu446 allele with raised triglycerides and lower glucose levels.

601832	TITLE *601832 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L29; RPL29
;;HP/HS-INTERACTING PROTEIN; HIP;;
HEPARIN/HEPARAN SULFATE-BINDING PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Liu et al. (1996) used RT-PCR to identify transcripts encoding cell
surface heparin/heparan sulfate- (HP/HS-) binding peptides. One clone
isolated in this manner had a predicted peptide sequence with features
of an HP/HS-binding motif; the authors termed this transcript HIP, for
'HP/HS interacting protein.' Liu et al. (1996) cloned the corresponding
cDNA from a HeLa cell cDNA library and found that it encodes a 159-amino
acid polypeptide 80% similar to the rodent ribosomal protein L29.
Transfection of HIP cDNA demonstrated cell surface expression, and the
sequence encodes neither a membrane-spanning region nor a glycosylation
site. Northern blot analysis revealed that HIP is expressed as a 1.3-kb
message in a variety of human cell lines and tissues.

Mammalian ribosome proteins are members of multigene families that are
composed predominantly of multiple processed pseudogenes and 1
functional-containing gene, although some, such as human ribosomal
protein L37a, are present as single-copy genes. During a large-scale
partial sequencing of human heart cDNA clones, Law et al. (1996) found a
novel clone that was very similar to the rat ribosomal protein L29 in
both DNA and amino acid sequences. The cDNA encodes a protein that shows
80.4% homology to protein L29 from the large ribosomal subunit of rat.
The putative protein has a large excess of basic residues over acidic
residues, with a unique lysine-rich tandem repeat structure that
suggested a binding function. Liu et al. (1996) showed that RPL29 had
the same nucleotide sequence as does cell surface heparin/heparan
sulfate-binding protein, also designated HB/HS interacting protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Rohde et al. (1996) demonstrated direct binding between heparin and HIP.
They showed that HIP is expressed on the surfaces of intact RL95 uterine
epithelial cells and that RL95 cell suspensions form aggregates when
incubated with antibodies directed against HIP. Using
immunofluorescence, Rohde et al. (1996) demonstrated that HIP is
expressed in both luminal and glandular epithelium of normal human
endometrium.

MAPPING

Garcia-Barcelo et al. (1997) used a PCR-based strategy to distinguish
the functional intron-containing gene RPL29 from multiple pseudogenes.
By somatic cell hybrid analysis, radiation hybrid mapping, and
fluorescence in situ hybridization, they localized RPL29 to the
telomeric region of 3q, where it was the most distal marker identified
to that time. The gene is close to RPL35A (180468), which maps to
3q29-qter.

Kirn-Safran et al. (2000) mapped the single-copy mouse Rpl29 gene to
distal chromosome 9. Promoter analysis indicated the presence of binding
motifs for ubiquitously expressed transcription factors and for nuclear
factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011), as well as the lack of a TATA box.

614758	TITLE *614758 DYNACTIN 4; DCTN4
;;DYN4;;
DYNACTIN, 62-KD SUBUNIT;;
p62
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DCTN4 is a subunit of the 20S dynactin complex. The dynactin complex is
involved in microtubule-dependent vesicular transport, spindle assembly,
and cell division (summary by Karki et al., 2000).

CLONING

By gene dosage analysis and sequencing candidate genes in a YAC contig
covering the critical region of the 5q deletion syndrome (153550),
followed by database analysis, Boultwood et al. (2000) identified a
DCTN4 clone designated 605d01. Northern blot analysis detected a 7.5-kb
DCTN4 transcript in all 15 human tissues examined.

By mass spectrometric analysis of the 62-kD protein that affinity
purified with human dynactin, followed by EST database analysis and PCR
of an NT2 human teratocarcinoma cDNA library, Karki et al. (2000) cloned
DCTN4, which they called p62. The deduced 460-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 52.3 kD. It has an N-terminal domain with
11 cysteines, the last 8 of which fit the consensus sequence for a RING
domain predicted to bind 2 Zn(2+) atoms. Northern blot analysis detected
variable expression of an approximately 4.2-kb transcript in all tissues
examined, with highest expression in heart and skeletal muscle.
Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that p62 had a punctate cytoplasmic
distribution as well as a centrosomal distribution typical of dynactin.

By immunohistochemical analysis, Ayalon et al. (2008) showed that Dyn4
colocalized with other dynactin subunits in adult mouse muscle fibers.
Dyn4 localized in a punctate distribution along costamere lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Karki et al. (2000) stated that p62 is present in the dynactin complex
at a stoichiometry of 1 copy per complex and that it localizes at 1 end
of the central ARP1 (ACTR1A; 605143) polymeric filament. Using
biochemical and immunoprecipitation analyses, they showed that p62
associated with the rat 20S dynactin complex. Recombinant human p62
bound immobilized in vitro-translated human ARP1. Overexpression of p62
in PtK2 porcine kidney cells did not disrupt microtubule organization or
the integrity of the Golgi, but it resulted in some p62 nuclear
localization.

ATP7B (606882) localizes to the trans-Golgi network, where it transports
copper to apoceruloplasmin (CP; 117700). When copper levels are in
excess, ATP7B redistributes to a vesicular compartment near the biliary
canalicular membranes, where excess copper is eliminated into bile.
Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human liver cDNA library, Lim et al.
(2006) found that the N-terminal domain of ATP7B, which contains 6
N-terminal metal-binding sites, interacted with the C-terminal domain of
p62. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that ATP7B, but not ATP7A
(300011), interacted with endogenous p62 in a human fibroblast line.
Depletion of copper reduced interaction of ATP7B with p62. Mutation
analysis revealed that the metal-binding CxxC motifs of ATP7B were
required for its interaction with p62, predominantly CxxC motifs 4
through 6. Lim et al. (2006) concluded that ATP7B is transported along
liver cell microtubules in a copper-dependent manner via interaction
with p62.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse heart cDNA library, Ayalon et al.
(2008) found that Ankb (ANK2; 106410) interacted with Dyn4. Protein
pull-down assays confirmed the interaction. Depletion of Ankb in adult
mouse skeletal muscle fibers disrupted costamere-associated
microtubules, concomitant with loss of costamere-associated Dyn4
expression.

MAPPING

By database and YAC contig analyses, Boultwood et al. (2000) mapped the
DCTN4 gene to chromosome 5q31-q32.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Emond et al. (2012) used exome sequencing and an extreme phenotype study
design to discover genetic variants influencing Pseudomonas aeruginosa
infection in cystic fibrosis. Forty-three individuals with early age of
onset of chronic P. aeruginosa infection (all below the tenth percentile
of age at onset), and the 48 oldest individuals who had not reached
chronic P. aeruginosa infection (all past the mean age of onset) were
sequenced. After Bonferroni adjustment, a single gene, DCTN4, was
significantly associated with time to chronic P. aeruginosa infection
(naive P = 2.2 x 10(-6); adjusted P = 0.025). Twelve of the 43
individuals in the early extreme sample carried a missense variant in
DCTN4, 9 a phe349-to-leu substitution (F349L; dbSNP rs11954652) and 3 a
tyr270-to-cys substitution (Y270C; dbSNP rs35772018). None of the 48
individuals in the late P. aeruginosa extreme sample had either missense
variant. Subsequently, 696 individuals with varied CFTR genotypes were
studied. Seventy-eight participants were heterozygous and 9 were
homozygous for the F349L (614758.0001) mutation; 15 were heterozygous
for the Y270C (614758.0002) mutation; 1 individual was heterozygous for
both mutations. The presence of at least 1 DCTN4 missense variant was
significantly associated with both early age of first P.
aeruginosa-positive culture (p = 0.01, hazard ratio = 1.4) and with
early age of onset of chronic P. aeruginosa infection (p = 0.004, hazard
ratio = 1.9). The risk was highest in individuals with less selective
bias toward a P. aeruginosa-negative history, i.e., children enrolled
before 1.5 years of age and 103 enrollees who participated in the study
despite a history of P. aeruginosa-positive cultures. No significant
interaction was found between CFTR genotypes and DCTN4 mutations,
although power to detect such an interaction was low.

613903	TITLE *613903 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 540; ZNF540
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZNF540 belongs to a large family of transcription factors characterized
by an N-terminal Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain and tandem
C-terminal C2H2-type zinc fingers (Qi et al., 2006).

CLONING

Using degenerate primers based on conserved sequences of KRAB
domain-containing zinc finger proteins to screen a 20-week-old embryonic
human heart cDNA library, followed by EST database analysis and 5-prime
and 3-prime RACE, Xiang et al. (2006) cloned ZNF540. The deduced
660-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 77.1 kD. It
has an N-terminal KRAB-A domain, followed by 17 tandem Kruppel C2H2-type
zinc fingers. Northern blot analysis detected variable ZNF540 expression
in all fetal tissues examined. Fluorescence-tagged ZNF540 localized to
both cytoplasm and nuclei of transfected COS-7 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By cotransfecting COS-7 cells with ZNF540 and a reporter gene system,
Xiang et al. (2006) showed that ZNF540 repressed serum response element
(SRE)- and ELK1 (311040)-mediated transcriptional activation, suggesting
that it functions in the MAP kinase (see 176948) signal transduction
pathway. Deletion analysis identified the KRAB-A domain of ZNF540 as the
main repressive domain. Small interfering RNA directed against ZNF540
reduced the transcriptional repression by ZNF540.

GENE STRUCTURE

spans approximately 62.8 kb.

604100	TITLE *604100 GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR, METABOTROPIC, 4; GRM4
;;MGLUR4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

L-glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central
nervous system and activates both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate
receptors, such as GRM4. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs),
which are G protein-coupled receptors, have been divided into 3 groups
on the basis of sequence homology, putative signal transduction
mechanisms, and pharmacologic properties. Group II and group III mGluRs
are linked to the inhibition of the cyclic AMP cascade, but differ in
their agonist selectivities. Group III agonists include
L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (L-AP4) and L-serine-O-phosphate (summary
by Wu et al., 1998).

CLONING

Using a PCR strategy with primers based on consensus regions of rat
mGluR1-5, Makoff et al. (1996) isolated partial cDNAs corresponding to
the human homologs of these genes. By probing a cerebellum library with
the partial human mGluR4 cDNA, the authors isolated additional mGluR4
cDNAs which between them contained the complete coding sequence for the
human protein. The predicted 912-amino acid human mGluR4 protein shares
90% identity with rat mGluR4. Northern blot analysis of human tissues
revealed that the approximately 5-kb mGluR4 mRNA was only expressed in
brain. In situ hybridization to brain tissues indicated that human
mGluR4 mRNA, like that of rat mGluR4, has a narrow distribution. In both
organisms, the highest level of expression was detected in the granule
cells of the cerebellum. Wu et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding 3
human group III mGluRs, mGluR4, mGluR7 (604101) and mGluR8 (601116), and
compared the pharmacologic properties of these receptors.

By database analysis, Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) identified GRM4
orthologs in mouse and fish. The deduced mouse protein contains 912
amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) determined that the GRM4 gene contains 7
exons.

MAPPING

Barbon et al. (2000) mapped the GRM4 gene to chromosome 6p21.3 by
radiation hybrid mapping.

Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) mapped the mouse Grm4 gene to chromosome 17.

ANIMAL MODEL

To provide a better understanding of the L-AP4 receptors, Pekhletski et
al. (1996) generated knockout mice lacking the mGluR4 gene. The mutant
mice did not display any gross motor abnormalities, impairments of
novelty-induced exploratory behaviors, or alterations in fine motor
coordination. However, they were deficient on the rotating rod
motor-learning test, suggesting that they may have an impaired ability
to learn complex motor tasks. Analysis of presynaptic short-term
synaptic plasticity at the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapse
demonstrated that paired-pulse facilitation and post-tetanic
potentiation were impaired in the mutant mice, although long-term
depression was unaffected. Pekhletski et al. (1996) concluded that an
important function of mGluR4 is to provide a presynaptic mechanism for
maintaining synaptic efficacy during repetitive activation, and that the
presence of mGluR4 at the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapse is
required for maintaining normal motor function. Gerlai et al. (1998)
found that mGluR4 mutant mice exhibited significantly accelerated
learning performance in a spatial reversal learning task. In a probe
trial administered 6 weeks posttraining, the mice showed impaired
spatial accuracy. These results suggested that mGluR4 mutant mice differ
in their ability to learn and integrate new spatial information into
previously formed memory traces and that their use of stored spatial
information is altered.

Fallarino et al. (2010) observed that mGluR4-null mice were markedly
vulnerable to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse
model of multiple sclerosis (MS; 126200), and developed immune responses
dominated by IL17 (603149)-producing T helper (TH17) cells. MGluR4 was
constitutively expressed on dendritic cells isolated from wildtype mice.
Signaling through mGluR4 decreased commitment to the TH17 phenotype by
decreasing intracellular cAMP. Treatment of wildtype mice with a
selective mGluR4 enhancer increased EAE resistance and offered a
protective response via a shift toward regulatory CD4+ T cells. In
contrast, dendritic cells from mGluR4-null mice showed defective mGluR4
signaling with resultant bias toward the TH17 phenotype. The findings
provided evidence that glutamate acts at the interface between the
nervous and immune systems, with mGluR4 present on dendritic cells in
the central nervous system. Fallarino et al. (2010) suggested that the
high amounts of glutamate associated with neuroinflammation might
reflect a counterregulatory mechanism that is protective in nature by
decreasing activation of pathogenic IL17-producing T cells.

603725	TITLE *603725 FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR 17; FGF17
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), such as FGF17, are growth factors and
oncogenes that contain a conserved, approximately 120-amino acid core.
Individual FGFs play important roles in embryonic development, cell
growth, morphogenesis, tissue repair, inflammation, angiogenesis, and
tumor growth and invasion (Hoshikawa et al., 1998).

CLONING

Hoshikawa et al. (1998) isolated human, mouse, and rat cDNAs encoding a
novel member of the FGF family, FGF17. The deduced 216-amino acid human
FGF17 protein is 98.6% identical to the mouse and rat Fgf17 proteins,
which are identical. Among known FGF family members, the FGF17 protein
is most similar to FGF8 (600483). FGF17 contains a typical hydrophobic
signal sequence at its N terminus, and the authors demonstrated that
recombinant rat Fgf17 can be efficiently secreted by High Five insect
cells. PCR analysis of rat adult tissues detected Fgf17 expression in
all tissues examined. In rat 14.5-day embryos, in situ hybridization
showed highest Fgf17 expression in the isthmus cerebellar and septum
neuroepithelia of the brain.

Using RT-PCR, Krejci et al. (2007) detected expression of several FGF
genes in femoral growth plate cartilage from 20- to 28-week gestation
fetuses; however, only FGF1 (131220), FGF2 (134920), FGF17, and FGF19
(603891) proteins were expressed at detectable levels.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed that FGF17 and FGF19 were uniformly
expressed throughout the growth plate. In contrast, FGF1 was expressed
only in the proliferative and hypertrophic zones, and FGF2 was expressed
only in the proliferative and resting zones.

To link FGF17 to GnRH (see 152760) biology, Miraoui et al. (2013)
examined Fgf17 expression in the nasal cavity of mouse embryos at
embryonic day 10.5, when GnRH neuron fate specification occurs. Fgf17
was robustly expressed in regions where Fgf8 is known to be highly
expressed: the commissural plate, the midbrain-hindbrain junction, and
the medial olfactory placode, where GnRH neurons emerge. Miraoui et al.
(2013) noted that there was hardly any Fgf17 expression in Fgf8
hypomorphic mice, suggesting that FGF17 should be considered a member of
the FGF8 synexpression group.

GENE FUNCTION

Using the Cre/loxP system, Sun et al. (2000) found that maintenance of
Fgf9 (600921) and Fgf17 expression is dependent on Shh (600725), whereas
Fgf8 expression is not. Sun et al. (2000) developed a model in which no
individual Fgf expressed in the apical ectodermal ridge is solely
necessary to maintain Shh expression, but instead the combined activity
of 2 or more apical ectodermal ridge Fgfs function in a positive
feedback loop with Shh to control limb development.

Krejci et al. (2007) showed that FGF1, FGF2, and FGF17, but not FGF19,
elicited potent activation of an ERK (see 601795) reporter gene in
primary cultures of human fetal chondrocytes. FGF1, FGF2, and FGF17, but
not FGF19, also inhibited proliferation of FGFR3 (134934)-expressing rat
chondrosarcoma chondrocytes.

Mariani et al. (2008) demonstrated that mouse limbs lacking Fgf4
(164980), Fgf9, and Fgf17 have normal skeletal pattern, indicating that
Fgf8 (600483) is sufficient among apical ectodermal ridge fibroblast
growth factors (AER-FGFs) to sustain normal limb formation. Inactivation
of Fgf8 alone causes a mild skeletal phenotype; however, when Mariani et
al. (2008) also removed different combinations of the other AER-FGF
genes, they obtained unexpected skeletal phenotypes of increasing
severity, reflecting the contribution that each FGF can make to the
total AER-FGF signal. Analysis of the compound mutant limb buds revealed
that, in addition to sustaining cell survival, AER-FGFs regulate
proximal-distal patterning gene expression during early limb bud
development, providing genetic evidence that AER-FGFs function to
specify a distal domain and challenging the longstanding hypothesis that
AER-FGF signaling is permissive rather than instructive for limb
patterning. Mariani et al. (2008) also developed a 2-signal model for
proximal-distal patterning to explain early specification.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 unrelated individuals with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
(HH20; 615270), Miraoui et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for
missense mutations in the FGF17 gene (603725.0001-603725.0003). One of
the 3 probands belonged to a large consanguineous 10-generation French
Canadian family with anosmic HH and cleft palate (see HH2, 147950), in
which Tornberg et al. (2011) had identified missense mutations in both
the FGFR1 (136350.0025) and HS6ST1 (604846.0002) genes; in that proband,
Miraoui et al. (2013) also identified 2 missense mutations in another
FGF-network gene, FLRT3 (604808.0001 and 604808.0002). Miraoui et al.
(2013) concluded that mutations in genes encoding components of the FGF
pathway are associated with complex modes of congenital HH (CHH)
inheritance and act primarily as contributors to an oligogenic genetic
architecture underlying CHH.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using whole brain imaging, Cholfin and Rubenstein (2007) found that mice
lacking Fgf17 showed a selective reduction in the size of the dorsal
frontal cortex, whereas the ventral/orbital frontal cortex was normal.
These changes were complemented by a rostromedial shift of sensory
cortical areas. The changes in regionalization persisted into adulthood.
Cholfin and Rubenstein (2007) concluded that FGF17 functions similarly
to FGF8 in patterning the neocortical map, but FGF17 is more selective
in regulating the properties of the dorsal but not ventral frontal
cortex.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 20 WITH ANOSMIA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
FGF17, ILE108THR

In the female proband from a large consanguineous 10-generation French
Canadian family with anosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH20;
615270) and cleft palate, previously reported by White et al. (1983) and
in whom Tornberg et al. (2011) had identified missense mutations in the
FGFR1 (R250Q; 136350.0025) and HS6ST1 (R296W; 604846.0002) genes,
Miraoui et al. (2013) also identified heterozygosity for a c.323T-C
transition in exon 4 of the FGF17 gene, resulting in an ile108-to-thr
(I108T) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the FGF core
domain. In addition, the proband was heterozygous and homozygous for 2
missense mutations in another FGF-network gene, FLRT3 (E97G, 604808.0001
and S144I, 604808.0002, respectively). Three other affected family
members also carried mutations in the FGFR1, HS6ST1, and FLRT3 genes,
and 4 unaffected family members carried 1 or 2 mutations in those genes,
but none had a mutation in the FGF17 gene. The I108T mutation was not
found in 155 controls or in the 1000 Genomes Project database. Analysis
of physical interactions between the ligand-binding region of FGFR1 and
FGF17 by surface-plasmon-resonance spectroscopy demonstrated that the
I108T mutant was defective in FGFR1 activation compared to wildtype; in
addition, the I108T mutant completely failed to activate the R250Q FGFR1
mutant, indicating that these 2 loss-of-function substitutions act in an
additive manner.

.0002
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 20 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
FGF17, ARG177HIS

In a sporadic male patient with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
(HH20; 615270), Miraoui et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a
c.530G-A transition in exon 5 of the FGF17 gene, resulting in an
arg177-to-his (R177H) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
FGF core domain. The patient, who had a normal sense of smell, also
displayed low bone mass. The R177H mutation was not found in 155
controls or in the 1000 Genomes Project database. Analysis of physical
interactions between the ligand-binding region of FGFR1 (135350) and
FGF17 by surface-plasmon-resonance spectroscopy demonstrated that the
R177H mutant had dramatically reduced ability to activate FGFR1 compared
to wildtype.

.0003
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 20 WITH ANOSMIA
FGF17, ASN187SER

In a sporadic male patient with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
(HH20; 615270), who was anosmic, Miraoui et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a c.560A-G transition in exon 5 of the FGF17 gene,
resulting in an asn187-to-ser (N187S) substitution at a conserved
residue in the C terminus. The mutation was not found in 155 controls or
in the 1000 Genomes Project database.

611239	TITLE *611239 G PROTEIN-REGULATED INDUCER OF NEURITE OUTGROWTH 1; GPRIN1
;;GRIN1;;
KIAA1893
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chen et al. (1999) cloned mouse Gprin1, which they called Grin1. By
database analysis, they identified human GPRIN1. Northern blot analysis
of human brain regions showed wide distribution in brain tissue and the
central nervous system with highest expression in the spinal cord.
Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected expression in brain
only, and Western analysis detected protein in mouse neuroblastoma and
rat pheochromocytoma cells. Using immunofluorescence studies and Western
analysis of cell fractions, the authors found that both GPRIN1 and GNAO1
(139311) are membrane-bound proteins that are enriched in the growth
cones of neurites.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned GPRIN1, which they designated
KIAA1893. The deduced 800-amino acid protein shares 46% amino acid
identity with its mouse homolog. RT-PCR ELISA of human tissues detected
moderate expression in brain, with low expression in lung and spleen.
RT-PCR ELISA of specific brain regions detected high expression in
cerebellum, followed by amygdala, hippocampus, substantia nigra, caudate
nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, thalamus, and spinal cord, with low
expression in corpus callosum.

Iida and Kozasa, 2004 noted that the deduced 856-amino acid GPRIN1
sequence shares high homology with GPRIN2 (611240) and GPRIN3 (611241)
over the C-terminal region.

GENE FUNCTION

Using purified recombinant GPRIN1 and GPRIN2 expressed in insect cells,
as well as immunoprecipitation studies from transfected COS cells, Chen
et al. (1999) showed that both GPRIN1 and GPRIN2 interacted specifically
with G-alpha-o and G-alpha-z (GNAZ; 139160) bound to GTP-gamma-S or
GDP-AlF4(-), but did not interact with GDP-bound forms of either G
protein subunit. Chen et al. (1999) showed that coexpression of GPRIN1
or GPRIN2 with activated G-alpha-o caused formation and extension of
neurite-like processes in mouse neuroblastoma cells.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the GPRIN1 gene to
chromosome 5.

602178	TITLE *602178 CHONDROADHERIN; CHAD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chondroadherin (CHAD) was initially described by Larsson et al. (1991)
as a 36-kD matrix protein isolated from bovine cartilage. It was shown
to mediate chondrocyte-matrix interactions. Analysis of cDNA generated
from a bovine chondrocyte mRNA demonstrated that chondroadherin belongs
to the family of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins. Of the LRR
proteins, chondroadherin is most closely related to the proteoglycans
decorin (125255), biglycan (301870), fibromodulin (600245), and lumican
(600616), and the matrix protein PRELP (601914). Each of these molecules
is present in the extracellular matrix of cartilage, each possesses 10
adjacent LRR regions flanked by disulfide-bonded domains, and each
possesses consensus motifs within the LRR regions for N-linked
glycosylation.

Grover et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA of the human CHAD gene using
PCR-based techniques. The gene encodes a protein of 359 amino acids, of
which the first 21 amino acids represent a putative signal peptide
sequence. It possesses 11 leucine-rich repeats flanked by cysteine-rich
regions. The cDNA has a 5-prime untranslated region of 149 bp, a coding
region of 1,080 bp including the stop codon, and a 3-prime untranslated
region of 561 bp terminating in a poly(A) tail. The cDNA hybridized with
a single messenger RNA of 1.9 kb, which is present in chondrocytes at
all ages.

GENE STRUCTURE

Grover et al. (1997) determined that the CHAD gene contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

Using a cosmid clone spanning the CHAD gene, Grover et al. (1997)
assigned the gene to 17q21.33 by PCR analysis of human/hamster somatic
cell hybrids and by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using full-length merlin (NF2; 607379) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a brain cDNA library, followed by RACE-PCR of placenta cDNA,
Lee et al. (2004) cloned RUTBC3, which they called MAP. The deduced
749-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular mass of 84.5 kD,
confirmed by in vitro translation. RUTBC3 contains an N-terminal TBC
domain, a central SH3 domain, and a C-terminal RUN domain. Northern blot
analysis detected 2.8- and 3.6-kb transcripts in most human tissues
examined, with highest expression in skeletal muscle and heart, followed
by spleen, thymus, liver, kidney, and placenta. Immunoblot analysis
detected RUTBC3 expression in neuroblastoma, lung carcinoma, mammary
adenocarcinoma, and NIH3T3 cell lines.

By database searching with the sequence of small G protein signaling
modulator-1 (SGSM1; 610440) as query, Yang et al. (2007) identified and
subsequently cloned RUTBC3, which they called SGSM3, from a human brain
cDNA library. The deduced protein shares a RAP (see RAP1A,
179520)-interacting domain (RAPID) (amino acids 301-350), containing 5
conserved blocks of sequence following the RUN domain, with SGSM1 and
SGSM2 (611418). Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of
3.4- and 4.0-kb SGSM3 transcripts in several human tissues. Mouse
tissues showed a similar Sgsm3 expression profile.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro and in vivo assays, Lee et al. (2004) showed that RUTBC3
binds merlin and that the interaction is mediated by the RUTBC3 RUN
domain and the C-terminal region of merlin. By confocal microscopy of
RUTBC3 and merlin expressed in NIH3T3 cells, the authors found that
RUTBC3 localized to perinuclear and membrane regions and merlin
localized to the cytoplasmic membrane. When RUTBC3 was coexpressed with
merlin, RUTBC3 and merlin colocalized to the cytoplasmic membrane. In
NIH3T3 cells, RUTBC3 increased merlin-mediated repression of
AP1-dependent promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. Expression
of either RUTBC3 or merlin alone reduced colony formation to between 50
and 60% of the control level, and coexpression further inhibited colony
formation to 10% of the control level. Lee et al. (2004) concluded that
RUTBC3 acts in cooperation with merlin to enhance suppression of cell
growth.

Using immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses of proteins
expressed by transfected human embryonic kidney cells, Yang et al.
(2007) showed that SGSM1, SGSM2, and SGSM3 coimmunoprecipitated with all
RAP proteins examined, including RAP1A, RAP1B (179530), RAP2A (179540),
and RAP2B (179541). Yang et al. (2007) also found that endogenous Rab4
(179511) and Rab11 (see RAB11A, 605570) interacted with all SGSM
proteins in the mouse neuroblastoma cell line; however, Rab3 (see RAB3A,
179490), Rab5 (see RAB5A, 179512), and Rab8 (see RAB8A, 165040)
interacted only with SGSM1 and SGSM3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yang et al. (2007) determined that the SGSM3 gene contains 22 exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SGSM3
gene to chromosome 22 (TMAP NIB2041). By genomic sequence analysis, Yang
et al. (2007) localized the gene to 22q13.1.

;;RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB2L; RAB2L
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Ras gene family of low molecular weight GTPases plays a central role
in membrane trafficking and is regulated in part by guanine nucleotide
dissociation stimulators (GDSs) such as RALGDS (601619). Isomura et al.
(1996) identified a fetal brain cDNA, designated RAB2L, that encodes a
predicted 122-amino acid protein with 39.5% homology to the C-terminal
(Ras-binding) region of RALGDS. However, since RAB2L has no apparent
homology to the GDS-activity domain of RALGDS, its function is likely to
be different from that of GDS proteins. By Northern blot analysis, RAB2L
was expressed as a 900-bp transcript in all tissues examined; a 3.2-kb
transcript was specifically expressed in heart and skeletal muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

Herberg et al. (1998) determined that the RGL2 gene contains 18 exons
and spans about 7.3 kb.

MAPPING

Isomura et al. (1996) mapped the RAB2L gene to 6p21.3 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization. By Southern hybridization analysis, Ando et al.
(1999) mapped the RAB2L gene, which they termed HKE1.5, approximately 5
kb centromeric of the HKE2 gene (605660). They mapped the mouse gene to
the proximal end of the H2 region.

606218	TITLE *606218 SELENOPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE 2; SEPHS2
;;SPS2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening activated CD8 (see 186910)-positive T cells with mouse
Sps2, a homolog of E. coli selD, as the probe, Guimaraes et al. (1996)
isolated a cDNA encoding human SPS2. The deduced 448-amino acid SPS2
protein contains Walker A- and B-like motifs, which are characteristic
of alpha/beta nucleotide-binding folds. The SPS2 Walker A-like motif is
a gly-rich site that includes a selenocysteine (sec) residue. Northern
blot analysis revealed preferential expression of a 2.3-kb transcript in
mouse tissues that produce selenoproteins, with lower expression in
sites of blood cell development. Levels of Sps2 mRNA were upregulated
upon activation of CD4 (186940)-positive lymphocytes. Western blot
analysis showed that Sps2 levels were 20-fold higher when the 3-prime
UTR of Sps2 was included in the expression construct in transfected
cells. Southern blot analysis indicated that SPS2 is well-conserved in
mammals.

UGA (TGA) codons normally serve as translational stop signals. However,
in cDNAs with stem-loop secondary structures called selenocysteine
insertion sequence (SECIS) elements, a translational stop is avoided and
UGA directs the incorporation of the amino acid selenocysteine into the
active site of the selenoprotein enzyme. Using a computational pattern
search to identify sequences that can adopt a SECIS-like secondary
structure, Lescure et al. (1999) discovered a SECIS in the 3-prime UTR
of SPS2 cDNA.

GENE FUNCTION

A labile selenium donor compound monoselenophosphate is synthesized from
selenide and ATP by SPS. Tamura et al. (2004) cloned SPS1 (600902) and
SPS2 from a cDNA library prepared from human lung adenocarcinoma cells.
Human lung SPS1 was cloned as an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,179 bp,
identical in sequence to that of human liver SPS1. The in-frame TGA
codon of lung SPS2 was genetically altered to TGT (cys); the resulting
gene was designated SPS2cys. Expression of the recombinant plasmids
containing SPS1 or SPS2cys was highly toxic to E. coli host cells grown
aerobically. Accordingly, the human lung SPS homologs were characterized
by an in vivo complementation assay using a selD mutant strain of E.
coli. These studies suggested an apparent substrate specificity of the
SPS1 and SPS2 gene products, leading Tamura et al. (2004) to suggest
that the SPS1-encoded enzyme depends on a selenium salvage system that
recycles L-selenocysteine, whereas the SPS2 enzyme can function with a
selenite assimilation system.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the SEPHS2 gene to chromosome 16p11.2 based on an
alignment of the SEPHS2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC002381) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Guimaraes et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Sps2 gene to the distal region
of chromosome 7 by interspecific backcross analysis.

314310	TITLE *314310 TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR FOR IMMUNOGLOBULIN HEAVY-CHAIN ENHANCER 3; TFE3
TFE3/ASPSCR1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED;;
TFE3/PRCC FUSION GENE, INCLUDED;;
TFE3/SFPQ FUSION GENE, INCLUDED;;
TFE3/CLTC FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TFE3, a member of the helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors,
binds to the mu-E3 motif of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer and
is expressed in many cell types (Henthorn et al., 1991).

CLONING

Macchi et al. (1995) cloned the TFE3 gene. They corrected the earlier
cDNA sequence and showed that the predicted protein is 371 amino acids
long and more similar to the mouse protein of 326 amino acids than had
been previously reported.

GENE STRUCTURE

Macchi et al. (1995) showed that the TFE3 gene consists of 7 exons. The
activation domain is in exon 2, the leucine zipper in exon 6, and the
basic helix-loop-helix motif occurs from exons 4 to 6.

MAPPING

Henthorn et al. (1991) localized the TFE3 gene to the proximal short arm
of the X chromosome using a somatic cell hybrid panel. A frequent RsaI
RFLP detected by the TFE3 cDNA was found and used to confirm this
location by linkage analysis, which placed TFE3 near markers in Xp11.22.
In the course of high-resolution comparative mapping of the proximal
region of the mouse X chromosome, Blair et al. (1995) mapped the Tfe3
gene to the same region as the Gata1 gene (305371).

GENE FUNCTION

Using an expression cloning strategy, Nakagawa et al. (2006) identified
TFE3 as a transactivator of metabolic genes that are regulated through
an E box in their promoters. Adenovirus-mediated expression of TFE3 in
hepatocytes in culture and in vivo strongly activated expression of
insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS2; 600797) and AKT (164730) and
enhanced phosphorylation of insulin-signaling kinases such as AKT,
glycogen synthase kinase-3-beta (605004), and p70S6 kinase (see 608939).
TFE3 also induced hexokinase II (HK2; 601125) and insulin-induced gene-1
(INSIG1; 602055). These changes led to metabolic consequences such as
activation of glycogen and protein synthesis, but not lipogenesis, in
liver. Collectively, plasma glucose levels were markedly reduced both in
normal mice and in different mouse models of diabetes. Activation of
insulin signals in both insulin depletion and resistance suggested that
TFE3 could be a therapeutic target for diabetes.

CYTOGENETICS

Translocations involving Xp11.2 have been found in synovial sarcoma and
in a subgroup of renal adenocarcinomas, namely, papillary renal cell
carcinoma (RCCX1; 300854) (Meloni et al., 1993). Of particular interest
is the similar localization of the breakpoints within Xp11 despite the
distinct histologic origin. Sinke et al. (1993) undertook to define the
precise location of the translocations in the 2 cases, making use of
tumor-derived interspecies somatic cell hybrids in conjunction with
Southern blot analysis. The resulting mapping data made it possible to
distinguish between the 2 translocations, to review the physical map of
the proximal Xp region, and to provide a basis for the eventual
isolation of the breakpoints and the genes involved in the development
of these 2 types of solid tumors. The chromosomal break in papillary
renal cell carcinoma was found to lie between PFC (300383), OATL1
(311240), TIMP (305370), SYP (313475), and TFE3, distally; and OATL2
(258870), together with a number of DNA markers (DXS226, DXS146, DXS255,
DXS14), proximally.

Shipley et al. (1995) studied 2 RCCP cell lines carrying a
t(X;1)(p11.2;q21.2) translocation; one was derived from the first female
case to be reported. By fluorescence in situ hybridization used to
position YACs along contigs in the Xp11.2 region relative to the
breakpoint and by correlation with mapping information from the region,
they concluded that the breakpoint is situated centromeric to SYP
(131475) and telomeric to DXS255 and CLCN5 (300008).

- Fusion Genes

The specific translocation reported by Meloni et al. (1993) was between
the X chromosome and chromosome 1: t(X;1)(p11;q21). Sidhar et al. (1996)
showed that in papillary renal cell carcinoma associated with the
translocation t(X;1)(p11.2;q21.2), the TFE3 gene is fused with the PRCC
gene (179755). They noted that a frequent theme for translocations in
sarcomas is the fusion of a transcription factor activation domain to a
transcription factor DNA-binding domain.

Clark et al. (1997) identified cases of papillary renal cell carcinoma
in which the splicing factor gene SFPQ (605199) was partnered with the
TFE3 gene as a result of a translocation, t(X;1)(p11.2;p34).

Cytogenetic studies identified a recurrent der(17) due to a
nonreciprocal t(X;17)(p11.2;q25) in cases of alveolar soft part sarcoma
(ASPS) (Joyama et al., 1999). By Southern blot analysis using a TFE3
probe, Ladanyi et al. (2001) identified nongermline bands in several
ASPS cases, consistent with rearrangement and possible fusion of TFE3
with a gene on 17q25. By amplification of the 5-prime portion of cDNAs
containing the 3-prime portion of TFE3 in 2 ASPS cases, they identified
a novel sequence, ASPSCR1 (606236), fused in-frame to TFE3 exon 4 or
exon 3. RT-PCR analysis detected an ASPSCR1/TFE3 fusion transcript in
all 12 ASPS cases studied. The ASPSCR1/TFE3 fusion replaces the
N-terminal portion of TFE3 by the fused ASPSCR1 sequences, while
retaining the TFE3 DNA-binding domain, implicating transcriptional
deregulation in the pathogenesis of ASPS.

Heimann et al. (2001) identified the ASPSCR1 gene, which they called
RCC17, partnered with TFE3 in two 5-year-old Belgian girls of African
origin in whom papillary renal cell carcinomas carried the translocation
t(X;17)(p11.2;q25). In both patients, the t(X;17) fused the N terminal
region of RCC17 to the C-terminal region of TFE3 including the bHLH
DNA-binding domain and the leucine zipper dimerization domain. The
reciprocal fusion transcript TFE3/RCC17 was also expressed.

Argani et al. (2003) reported a case of renal cell carcinoma in which
the 3-prime exons of the TFE3 gene were fused with the 5-prime exons of
the CLTC gene (118955) as a result of a translocation,
t(X;17)(p11.2;q23). The patient was a 14-year-old boy who presented with
gross hematuria and was found by CT to have a finely calcified left
renal mass.

612695	TITLE *612695 VAULT RNA 1-1; VTRNA1-1
;;HVG1;;
VAULT RNA COMPONENT 1; VAULTRC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Vaults are large cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteins of about 13 MD. They are
composed of a major vault protein, MVP (605088), 2 minor vault proteins,
TEP1 (601686) and PARP4 (607519), and a nontranslated RNA component,
VTRNA1-1 (Kickhoefer et al., 1999).

CLONING

By PCR of a human genomic DNA library, Kickhoefer et al. (1998) cloned
VTRNA1-1, which they called HVG1. The 96-base RNA contains an internal
RNA polymerase III (see 606007)-type promoter element and ends with a
typical polymerase III termination signal.

Kickhoefer et al. (2003) found that the mouse genome contains only 1
expressed vault RNA gene, which they called Mvr1. Northern blot analysis
detected a single Mvr1 transcript in all mouse tissues examined, with
highest expression in lung, heart, and spleen and lowest expression in
brain.

Nandy et al. (2009) described the structure of VTRNA1-1. The
99-nucleotide RNA forms an extended stem-loop structure with asymmetric
internal bulges. It contains characteristic internal polymerase III
A-box and B-box promoter elements and a downstream B2-box motif. Size
exclusion chromatography of fractionated HeLa cells, followed by
Northern and Western blot analyses, detected about 5% of the VTRNA1-1
and VTRNA1-2 content eluting with MVP, while 95% remained in the
supernatant.

GENE FUNCTION

Kickhoefer et al. (1998) found that HVG1, but not HVG2 (VTRNA1-2;
612696) or HVG3 (VTRNA1-3; 612696), associated with vaults in human cell
lines. However, only a proportion of HVG1 associated with vaults, and
HVG1 not associated with vaults remained in the soluble fraction.
Expression of MVP and HVG1 and assembly of vaults increased up to
15-fold in several drug-resistant cell lines compared with the parental
cell lines. Increased vault assembly was associated with a concomitant
shift of HVG1 from the soluble to the pellet fraction. Kickhoefer et al.
(1998) hypothesized that the absolute vault level in cell lines may
dictate the extent of drug resistance.

Using Northern blot analysis, Kickhoefer et al. (1999) found that the
vault RNAs HVG1 and HVG4 copurified with vaults from all human cell
types examined and interacted with mouse Tep1 in a yeast 3-hybrid
screen. However, Kickhoefer et al. (2003) reported that HVG4 is not
expressed.

Nandy et al. (2009) found that expression of VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2,
VTRNA1-3, and CBL3 (VTRNA2-1; 614938) was upregulated in cord blood
lymphocytes infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Upregulation was
highest for VTRNA1-1 (about 1,100-fold) and lowest for CBL3 (about
3-fold). Expression of VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2, and CBL3 was also upregulated
by the EBV-related Kaposi sarcoma virus, but not by members of other
virus families.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kickhoefer et al. (2003) determined that the upstream region of the
VTRNA1-1 gene contains a TATA-like element, a consensus proximal
sequence, and a cAMP response element.

MAPPING

Kickhoefer et al. (2003) stated that the VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2, and
VTRNA1-3 genes map to a 16-kb region of chromosome 5. A vault RNA
pseudogene, HVG4, maps to chromosome X. The only expressed mouse vault
RNA gene, Mvr1, maps to chromosome 18.

Nandy et al. (2009) stated that the VTRNA1-1 gene is located near the
PCDHA gene cluster (604966), which Wu and Maniatis (1999) mapped to
chromosome 5q31.

CaV2.2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels are multisubunit complexes found in
the membrane of many excitable cells that regulate calcium entry (see
601011). N-type calcium channels, which control neurotransmitter release
from neurons, are dihydropyridine-insensitive and
omega-conotoxin-sensitive. The alpha-1 subunit forms the pore through
which calcium enters the cell, and is encoded by a family of at least 5
genes.

CLONING

Williams et al. (1992) cloned the neuronal alpha-1B subunit by probing
brain cDNA libraries with a rabbit probe. RT-PCR revealed 2
alternatively spliced isoforms, encoding predicted products of 2,339
(alpha-1B-1) and 2,237 (alpha-1B-2) amino acids, with 64% and 73%
identity to the rabbit gene product, respectively. Both isoforms are
transcribed only in central nervous system tissue.

MAPPING

Diriong et al. (1995) and Kim et al. (1997) mapped the CACNA1B gene to
chromosome 9q34 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Williams et al. (1992) used transient expression studies in HEK293 cells
to demonstrate that CACNA1B had N-type calcium channel activity.

Using binding and immunoprecipitation assays on adult rat cortical
tissue, Maeno-Hikichi et al. (2003) showed that the enigma-like LIM
domain protein (ENH; 605904) interacts specifically with protein kinase
C-epsilon (PRKCE; 176975) and the C terminus of CACNA1B to form a
macromolecular complex. Functional studies in Xenopus oocytes indicated
that expression of ENH resulted in increased rapid and specific
modulation of N-type calcium channels by PKCE. The authors concluded
that through interactions with a common adaptor protein, the formation
of a kinase-substrate complex is the molecular basis for the specificity
and efficiency of cellular signaling.

The CaV2.2 calcium channel interacts with and is modulated by CRMP2
(602463). Overexpression of CRMP2 leads to increased surface expression
of CaV2.2 on neurons, enhanced calcium currents, and an increase in
stimulated release of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide
(CGRP; 114130) from dorsal root ganglia (summary by Brittain et al.,
2011).

ANIMAL MODEL

Kim et al. (2001) found that CaV2.2-null mice were viable and fertile
and showed normal motor coordination. CaV2.2-null mice exhibited reduced
responses to certain pain stimuli, suggesting that CaV2.2 plays a role
in pain perception at the spinal level, but not at the supraspinal
level.

Kim et al. (2009) observed elevated aggression in CaV2.2-null mice.
CaV2.2 is highly expressed in the dorsal raphe nucleus of adult rats,
and injection of an N-type Ca(2+) channel blocker into the dorsal raphe
nucleus of wildtype mice resulted in increased aggressive behavior. Kim
et al. (2009) concluded that N-type Ca(2+) channels in the dorsal raphe
nucleus have a role in the control of aggression.

In rats, Brittain et al. (2011) demonstrated that inflammatory and
neuropathic hypersensitivity can be suppressed by a synthetic 15-mer
peptide (CBD3) that uncouples Crmp2 and CaV2.2 calcium channels in
neurons. Studies in cultured neurons and spinal cord slices showed that
CBD3 peptide bound CaV2.2, interfered with the interaction of Crmp2 and
CaV2.2, and reduced channel function, as evidenced by decreased CGRP
neuropeptide release from sensory neurons and decreased excitatory
synaptic transmission in dorsal horn neurons. In rats, treatment with
CBD3 also reduced meningeal blood flow and reduced nocifensive behavior
induced by peripheral formalin injection or corneal capsaicin
application, as well as reversed neuropathic hypersensitivity produced
by an antiretroviral drug. The peptide was mildly anxiolytic without
affecting memory retrieval, sensorimotor function or depression.
