600169	TITLE *600169 MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX CLASS I CHAIN-RELATED GENE A; MICA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes typically encode
polymorphic peptide-binding chains that are ubiquitously expressed and
mediate the recognition of intracellular antigens by cytotoxic T cells.
Motivated by the association of HLA-B27 with rheumatoid and inflammatory
diseases, Bahram et al. (1994) found a family of sequences in the human
MHC that are highly divergent from all of the known MHC class I genes
and were presumably derived early in the evolution of mammalian class I
genes. These MIC genes (for MHC class I chain-related genes) evolved in
parallel with the human class I genes and with those of most, if not
all, mammalian orders. Bahram et al. (1994) cloned the MICA gene in this
family and stated that it was by far the most divergent mammalian MHC
class I gene known. The MICA gene encodes a 383-amino acid polypeptide
with a predicted mass of 43 kD. It is further distinguished by its
unusual exon-intron organization and preferential expression in
fibroblasts and epithelial cells. However, the presence of distinctive
residues in the MICA amino acid sequence translated from cDNA suggested
that the putative MICA chain folds similarly to typical class I chains
and may have the capacity to bind peptide or other short ligands. Thus,
a second lineage of evolutionarily conserved MHC class I genes was
defined by these results. MICA and other members of this family may have
been selected for specialized functions that are either ancient or
derived from those of typical MHC class I genes, in analogy to some of
the nonclassic mouse H-2 genes.

MAPPING

Bahram et al. (1994) demonstrated that the MICA gene is located near
HLA-B (142830) on chromosome 6. Nalabolu et al. (1996) showed that the
MICA and MICB (602436) genes occur in a 200-kb region spanning the TNFA
(191160) and TNFB (153440) cluster at chromosome 6p21.3.

GENE FUNCTION

T cells with variable region V-delta-1 gamma/delta T-cell receptors (see
TCRG, 186970, and TCRD, 186810) are distributed throughout the human
intestinal epithelium and may function as sentinels that respond to self
antigens. The expression of MICA matches this localization. Groh et al.
(1998) found that MICA and the closely related MICB were recognized by
intestinal epithelial T cells expressing diverse V-delta-1 gamma/delta
TCRs. These interactions involved the alpha-1/alpha-2 domains of MICA
and MICB but were independent of antigen processing. With intestinal
epithelial cell lines, the expression and recognition of MICA and MICB
could be stress induced. Thus, these molecules may broadly regulate
protective responses by the V-delta-1 gamma/delta T cells in the
epithelium of the intestinal tract.

Bauer et al. (1999) found that MICA binds NKG2D (KLRK1; 611817) on
gamma/delta T cells, CD8+ alpha/beta T cells, and natural killer (NK)
cells. Engagement of NKG2D activated cytolytic responses of gamma/delta
T cells and NK cells against transfectants and epithelial tumor cells
expressing MICA. These results defined an activating immunoreceptor-MHC
ligand interaction that may promote antitumor NK- and T-cell responses.

MIC engagement of NKG2D stimulates NK-cell and T-cell effector
functions. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection induces the expression of
stress proteins such as HSP70 (140550). By flow cytometric analysis,
Groh et al. (2001) showed that CMV infection also induces MIC expression
and a concurrent downregulation of MHC class I molecules on fibroblasts
and endothelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of lung sections
from patients with CMV interstitial pneumonitis confirmed that induction
of MIC expression also occurs in vivo. Functional analysis of T-cell
cytotoxicity against CMV-infected fibroblasts showed that early after
infection when MIC expression was low, antibodies to MHC class I, but
not to MIC or NKG2D, could block T cell-mediated cytolysis. As MIC
expression increased, antibody masking of MIC or NKG2D reduced target
cell lysis; anti-MHC class I antibodies further reduced cytolysis. The
presence of MICA on stimulator cells also substantially enhanced
cytokine release by T-cell clones, and anti-MIC antibody abrogated this
production, suggesting that the MIC-NKG2D interaction provides an
important costimulatory activity.

Groh et al. (2002) showed that NKG2D binding of MIC induces endocytosis
and degradation of NKG2D. In cancer patients, NKG2D expression was
markedly reduced in both CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T cells and in
peripheral blood T cells, associated with circulating tumor-derived
soluble MICA. The downregulation of NKG2D causes a severe impairment of
tumor antigen-specific effector T cells. Groh et al. (2002) proposed
that this mode of T cell silencing through MIC shedding may promote
tumor immune evasion and inferred that it could also compromise host
resistance to infections.

Using immunohistopathologic and flow cytometric analyses, Hue et al.
(2004) found increased expression of MICA at epithelial cell surfaces in
celiac disease (CD; 212750) patients exposed to gliadin. Patient biopsy
specimens exposed to an IL15 (600554)-inducing gliadin fragment did not
express MICA in the presence of anti-IL15. Cytotoxicity assays showed
that NKG2D played primarily a costimulatory role on intraepithelial
lymphocytes (IELs), with a TCR-mediated signal required for complete
activation. However, in refractory celiac sprue patients, NKG2D mediated
a direct activating signal. ELISA detected soluble MICA in serum in half
of untreated CD patients, but in few patients on gluten-free diets; the
presence of soluble MICA was independent of MICA genotype. Hue et al.
(2004) proposed that villous atrophy in CD may be ascribed to
IEL-mediated damage to enterocytes involving NKG2D-MICA interaction
after gliadin-induced expression of MICA on gut epithelium.

Kriegeskorte et al. (2005) showed that the NKG2D ligands H60 and MICA
could mediate strong suppressive effects on T-cell proliferation. The
suppression did not occur in Il10 (124092)-deficient mice and involved a
receptor other than NKG2D. Kriegeskorte et al. (2005) concluded that
NKG2D ligands can induce strong inhibitory effects in addition to
stimulatory effects

Kaiser et al. (2007) showed that on the surface of tumor cells, MICA
associates with endoplasmic reticulum protein-5 (ERP5; 611099), which,
similar to protein disulfide isomerase (176790), usually assists in the
folding of nascent proteins inside cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of
thioreductase activity and ERP5 gene silencing revealed that
cell-surface ERP5 function is required for MICA shedding. ERP5 and
membrane-anchored MICA formed transitory mixed disulfide complexes from
which soluble MICA was released after proteolytic cleavage near the cell
membrane. Kaiser et al. (2007) suggested that reduction of the seemingly
inaccessible disulfide bond in the membrane-proximal alpha-3 domain of
MICA must involve a large conformational change that enables proteolytic
cleavage. They concluded that their results uncovered a molecular
mechanism whereby domain-specific deconstruction regulates MICA protein
shedding, thereby promoting tumor immune evasion, and identified surface
ERP5 as a strategic target for therapeutic intervention.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Using multiwavelength-anomalous dispersion phases at a resolution of 2.7
angstroms, Li et al. (2001) determined the crystal structure of MICA and
NKG2D. They showed that NKG2D forms a homodimer that interacts with a
MICA monomer.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The predicted amino acid sequence of the MICA chain suggests that it
folds similarly to typical class I chains and may have the capacity to
bind peptides or other short ligands (Bahram et al., 1994). Therefore,
MICA was predicted to have a specialized function in antigen
presentation or T cell recognition. During nucleotide sequence analyses
of the MICA genomic clone, Mizuki et al. (1997) found a triplet repeat
microsatellite polymorphism (GCT/AGC)n in the transmembrane region of
the MICA gene. In 68 HLA homozygous B cell lines, 5 distinct alleles of
this microsatellite sequence were detected. One of them contained an
additional 1-bp insertion that created a frameshift resulting in a
premature termination codon in the transmembrane region. This particular
allele was thought to encode a soluble, secreted form of the MICA
molecule. Mizuki et al. (1997) also investigated this microsatellite
polymorphism in 77 Japanese patients with Behcet disease (109650), which
had previously been known to be associated with HLA-B51. The
microsatellite allele consisting of 6 repetitions of GCT/AGC was present
at significantly higher frequency in the patient population (Pc =
0.00055) than in a control population. Furthermore, the (GCT/AGC)6
allele was present in all B51 positive patients and in an additional 13
B51 negative patients. These results suggested the possibility of a
primary association of Behcet disease with MICA rather than HLA-B.

Wallace et al. (1999) investigated the association of the 16 previously
described external domain alleles and the transmembrane triplet repeats
of the MICA gene with Behcet disease in a Middle Eastern population. The
results showed an increase of MICA*009 in the Behcet disease patient
group (44 of 95; 46%) compared with controls (24 of 102; 24%), giving an
odds ratio (OR) of 2.8. The A6 form of a MICA transmembrane triplet
repeat was found to be significantly raised in the patients (80 of 95;
84%) compared with controls (58 of 102; 57%), giving an OR of 4. The
most significant association was that between Behcet disease and
HLA-B51. Wallace et al. (1999) interpreted the data as indicating that
since both MICA*009 and A6 are in strong linkage disequilibrium with
HLA-B51, they are unlikely to be the susceptibility genes for Behcet
disease but may be markers for additional risk factors.

Mizuki et al. (2000) studied the localization of the pathogenic gene of
Behcet disease using microsatellite analysis of 3 different populations:
Japanese, Greek, and Italian. In genotypic differentiation between
patients and controls, the authors found that only HLA-B51 was
significantly associated with BD in all 3 populations. These results
suggested that the pathogenic gene of BD is HLA-B51 itself and not other
genes located in the vicinity of HLA-B.

The MICA and MICB genes are polymorphic, displaying an unusual
distribution of a number of variant amino acids in their extracellular
alpha-1, alpha-2, and alpha-3 domains. To further define the
polymorphism of MICA, Petersdorf et al. (1999) examined its alleles
among 275 individuals with common and rare HLA genotypes. Of 16
previously defined alleles, 12 were confirmed, and 5 new alleles were
identified. A 2-by-2 analysis of MICA and HLA-B alleles uncovered a
number of significant associations. These results confirmed and extended
previous knowledge on the polymorphism of MICA. Petersdorf et al. (1999)
suggested that a strong positive linkage of certain MICA and HLA-B
alleles may have implications for studies related to MHC-associated
diseases and transplantation.

Komatsu-Wakui et al. (1999) studied polymorphisms in the MICA gene in
Japanese. They observed 8 MICA alleles in Japanese individuals, among
which 1, tentatively named MIC-AMW, had not previously been reported.
There was a strong linkage disequilibrium between MICA and HLA-B loci;
each MICA allele showed strong association with a particular HLA-B
group. Komatsu-Wakui et al. (1999) also identified a MICA-MICB null
haplotype, which was associated with HLAB*4801. In this haplotype, they
found large-scale deletion (of approximately 100 kb), including the
entire MICA gene, and a MICB gene that possessed a stop codon.

To summarize, the MICA gene has a microsatellite repeat, GCT(n), within
exon 5, encoding for a variable number of alanines (Ala = A).
Perez-Rodriguez et al. (2000) described a novel MICA allele with 10 GCT
repeats (A10); 4 different repeats of this microsatellite had been
previously reported: A4, A5, A6, and A9. An association of Behcet
disease with the A9 repeat had been reported by Mizuki et al. (1997).

Gambelunghe et al. (2001) concluded the existence of distinct genetic
markers for childhood/young-onset IDDM (222100) and for adult-onset
IDDM, namely the MICA5 and MICA5.1 alleles, respectively.

Mei et al. (2009) analyzed the relationship between Chlamydia
trachomatis, tubal pathology, and MICA allele polymorphisms in 214
infertile Chinese women. They found no association between MICA alleles
and the presence or absence of tubal pathology in infertile women with
antibodies to C. trachomatis. However, an association was found between
the MICA*008 allele and infertile women without antibodies to C.
trachomatis. Mei et al. (2009) concluded that MICA may modify host
susceptibility to C. trachomatis infection.

Aquino-Galvez et al. (2009) analyzed the MICA gene in 80 sporadic
patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; 178500) and 201
controls and found a significant increase of MICA*001 allele in the IPF
cohort (odds ratio, 2.91; corrected p = 0.03). In addition, the MICA
*001/*00201 genotype was significantly increased in patients with IPF
compared with healthy controls (odds ratio, 4.72; corrected p = 0.01).
Strong immunoreactive MICA staining was localized in alveolar epithelial
cells and fibroblasts from IPF lungs, whereas control lungs were
negative. Soluble MICA was detected in 35% of IPF patients compared to
12% of control subjects (p = 0.0007). The expression of the MICA
receptor NKG2D (KLRK1; 611817) was significantly decreased in
gamma/delta T cells and natural killer cells obtained from IPF lungs.
Aquino-Galvez et al. (2009) concluded that MICA polymorphisms and
abnormal expression of NKG2D might contribute to IPF susceptibility.

region and progression from chronic hepatitis C to hepatocellular
carcinoma, see 114550.

ANIMAL MODEL

The MICA/MICB locus is not conserved in mice; however, mice do have
counterpart NKG2D ligands, Rae1-beta and H60. Diefenbach et al. (2001)
demonstrated that ectopic expression of these ligands in tumor cell
lines resulted not only in potent rejection mediated by either NK cells
or CD8-positive T cells, but that mice subsequently challenged with
tumor cell lines not expressing the ligands were also immune to the
tumors. Girardi et al. (2001) determined that immunity to cutaneous
malignancies could be mediated by NKG2D-expressing intraepithelial
gamma/delta T cells. Girardi et al. (2001) proposed that the diverse
expression of NKG2D on cytolytic cell types may allow attacks on tumor
cells in different anatomical compartments and that gamma/delta T cells
may be particularly important in skin and gut.

104230	TITLE *104230 FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE 4; FUT4
;;ALPHA-3-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE; FCT3A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In human/mouse myeloid cell hybrids, Geurts van Kessel et al. (1984)
tested for reactivity with monoclonal antibodies with known myelocytic,
monocytic, or myelomonocytic specificity. Twenty antibodies, all of
which bound specifically to the surface of human myeloid cells,
exhibited similar reactivity patterns with the hybrid clones.
Chromosomal analysis showed that the gene or genes involved in
expression of the 1 or more antigens recognized by these antibodies must
be located on human chromosome 11q12-qter. This myeloid-associated
surface antigen was designated CD15 in the CD system.

Tetteroo et al. (1987) found that alpha-3-fucosyltransferase activity
correlated with the presence of human chromosome 11 in human-mouse
myeloid cell hybrids. Also, several other myeloid-associated
carbohydrate antigens, e.g., LeX (CD15), were associated with chromosome
11. Tetteroo et al. (1987) concluded that an alpha-3-fucosyltransferase
gene on chromosome 11 is responsible for synthesis of these antigens.

Couillin et al. (1991) identified an alpha-3-fucosyltransferase on
chromosome 11q, FUT4, that transferred fucose onto H type 2 more
efficiently than onto sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine, suggesting that it is
the myeloid type of alpha-3-fucosyltransferase that makes the
3-fucosyllactosamine epitope (CD15) on polymorphonuclear cells and
monocytes.

Of the fucosyltranstransferases examined by Cailleau-Thomas et al.
(2000), only FUT4 and FUT9 (606865) were expressed during human
embryogenesis; all of the others showed irregular or weak expression. By
Northern blot analysis of 40- to 70-day-old embryos, they found
increasing expression of 6-, 3-, and 2.3-kb FUT4 transcripts. Analysis
of fetal tissues revealed abundant expression in liver, muscle, kidney,
skin, and small intestine, and moderate expression in brain, lung, and
heart. The transcript size varied in different tissues. In adult
tissues, highest expression was found in lung and small intestine, low
expression in kidney, liver, and brain, and no expression in 12 other
tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Nakayama et al. (2001) showed that FUT9 directs CD15 synthesis in
lymphoid cells and mature granulocytes, whereas FUT4 directs CD15
synthesis in promyelocytes and monocytes. FUT9 exhibited stronger
activity for CD15 synthesis than FUT4.

MAPPING

Using human/mouse hybrid cell lines, Couillin et al. (1991) mapped a
human alpha-3-fucosyltransferase, FUT4, to chromosome 11q. Using panels
of somatic cell and radiation hybrids which retained different
rearrangements of chromosome 11, Reguigne et al. (1994) assigned the
FUT4 gene to chromosome 11q21, between D11S388 and D11S919. Using
fluorescence in situ hybridization and a cosmid containing FUT4
sequence, McCurley et al. (1995) confirmed the assignment of the FUT4
gene to chromosome 11q21.

Gersten et al. (1995) demonstrated that the mouse Fut4 gene maps to
chromosome 9 in a region showing syntenic homology with human 11q.

136515	TITLE *136515 FOS-LIKE ANTIGEN 1; FOSL1
;;FOS-RELATED ANTIGEN 1; FRA1
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FUNCTION

Osteoclasts are bone-resorbing cells derived from hematopoietic
precursors of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. Mice lacking Fos (164810)
develop osteopetrosis (see 166600) due to an early differentiation block
in the osteoclast lineage. Matsuo et al. (2000) investigated the
mechanism by which Fos exerts its specific function in osteoclast
differentiation. They showed by retroviral-gene transfer that all 4 Fos
proteins--Fos, FosB (164772), Fosl1, and Fosl2 (601575)--but not the Jun
proteins (e.g., 165160), rescued the differentiation block in vitro.
Structure-function analysis demonstrated that the major carboxy-terminal
transactivation domains of Fos and FosB are dispensable and that Fosl1,
which lacks transactivation domains, has the highest rescue activity.
Moreover, a transgene expressing Fosl1 rescued the osteopetrosis of Fos
mutant mice in vivo. The osteoclast differentiation factor Rankl
(602642) induced transcription of Fosl1 in a Fos-dependent manner,
thereby establishing a link between Rank signaling and the expression of
Ap1 proteins in osteoclast differentiation.

Kustikova et al. (1998) found a correlation between Fra1 expression and
mesenchymal characteristics in cell lines of epithelial tumor origin.
Exogenous expression of Fra1 in epithelioid cells resulted in
morphologic changes that resembled fibroblastoid conversion, with cells
acquiring elongated shape and increased motility and invasiveness in
vitro. The morphologic alterations were accompanied by transcriptional
activation of genes whose expression is often induced at late stages of
tumor progression.

MAPPING

Sinke et al. (1993) applied the designation 'reverse mapping' to the
identification of a previously known gene within a cosmid for which the
localization was already known. For the identification of sequence
tagged sites (STSs) within cosmid clones derived from the 11q13 region,
they subcloned a number of single-copy BamHI fragments. In one of the
subclones, they found a sequence that matched perfectly with the 5-prime
end of the cDNA sequence for human FRA1. The FRA1 fragment was contained
within a clone previously mapped to region V of a long-range contig map
of 11q13. The localization to chromosome 11 was cross-checked by
hybridization to a panel of somatic cell hybrids. Thus another oncogene
was assigned to the region implicated in a number of different forms of
malignancy.

ANIMAL MODEL

Eferl et al. (2004) noted that Fra1 knockout in mice results in
embryonic death in utero, likely due to placental defects. Using
conditional deletion, they deleted Fra1 throughout mouse embryos, but
not in extraembryonic tissues, such as placenta. Homozygous mutant mice
were viable, but they developed osteopenia due to reduced bone
formation. The numbers of osteoblasts and osteoclasts were unchanged,
although in vitro and in vivo analysis revealed severely reduced
bone-forming activity of osteoblasts. Eferl et al. (2004) concluded that
the defect was likely due to reduced expression of the bone matrix genes
osteocalcin (112260), collagen-1A2 (120160), and matrix Gla protein
(154870).

602284	TITLE *602284 BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN 8B; BMP8B
;;BMP8;;
OSTEOGENIC PROTEIN 2; OP2
DESCRIPTION The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a family of secreted
signaling molecules that can induce ectopic bone growth. Many BMPs,
including BMP8B, are part of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB)
superfamily (see 190180) (Ozkaynak et al., 1992).

CLONING

Using a mouse Op2 probe, Ozkaynak et al. (1992) isolated a novel BMP
cDNA, which they designated OP2, from a human hippocampus library. The
predicted 402-amino acid OP2 protein is processed into a 139-amino acid
mature form. In the TGFB domain, OP2 shows 74% amino acid sequence
identity to OP1 (BMP7; 112267), and 55 to 74% identity to other BMPs. In
mice, Northern blot analysis revealed high levels of Op2 mRNA as 3- and
5-kb transcripts in early embryos, but no detectable levels in any
organs studied.

Using quantitative RT-PCR, Whittle et al. (2012) detected variable Bmp8b
expression in all mouse tissues examined, with high expression in testis
and brown adipose tissue, much lower expression in brain and
subcutaneous white adipose tissue, and very low expression in gonadal
white adipose tissue, liver, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle.

MAPPING

By interspecific backcross analysis, DiLeone et al. (1997) mapped the
mouse Bmp8 gene to chromosome 4. Based on homology of synteny, they
mapped the human gene to 1p35-p32.

Hartz (2012) mapped the BMP8B gene to chromosome 1p34.2 based on an
alignment of the BMP8B sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC023526) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Whittle et al. (2012) found that expression of Bmp8b in mice was
upregulated by refeeding after fasting and by activation of thermogenic
responses. Reporter gene assays revealed that the Bmp8b promoter could
be induced by thermogenic thyroid hormone receptor beta-1 (THRB; 190160)
and by PPAR-alpha (PPARA; 170998) or PPAR-gamma (PPARG; 601487).
Treatment of mouse brown adipocytes with recombinant human BMP8B
increased Smad (see 601595) phosphorylation and activation of
hormone-sensitive lipase (LIPE; 151750) and AMPK (see 602739). BMP8B
increased the lipolytic response to norepinephrine, and inhibition of
Alk7 (ACVR1C; 608981) antagonized this effect.

ANIMAL MODEL

Whittle et al. (2012) reported that Bmp8b -/- mice were viable and
healthy but infertile due to defective primordial germ cell formation. A
significant number of Bmp8b -/- pups suffered early death, but survival
increased in a warm environment. Bmp8b -/- mice were prone to weight
gain, particularly on a high fat diet, and they showed reduced core body
temperature and impaired adrenergic-dependent thermogenic capacity.
Intracerebroventricular treatment of Bmp8b -/- mice with recombinant
human BMP8B resulted in marked weight loss and increased core body
temperature. The central thermogenic action of BMP8B was dependent upon
activation levels of hypothalamic Ampk. Whittle et al. (2012) concluded
that BMP8B has a fundamental role in energy balance regulation in both
the hypothalamus and brown adipose tissue.

;;SESQUIPEDALIAN, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 2; SES2;;
INOSITOL POLYPHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE-INTERACTING PROTEIN, 27-KD, B;
IPIP27B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FAM109A (614239) and FAM109B regulate endosomal trafficking and link
OCRL (300535) to the recycling of receptors at sorting and recycling
endosomes (Noakes et al., 2011).

CLONING

By scanning the literature, Swan et al. (2010) identified a Drosophila
protein as a candidate interactor of Ocrl. They named the Drosophila
protein Ses, short for sesquipedalian, meaning an unnecessarily long
description of a simple thing. Database analysis revealed conservation
of Ses from invertebrates to humans. In the same way that the
invertebrate Ocrl gene is duplicated in vertebrates to produce OCRL and
INPP5B (147264), the single Ses gene in invertebrates is duplicated in
vertebrates to produce FAM109A and FAM109B, which Swan et al. (2010)
called SES1 and SES2, respectively. The N-terminal portion of SES1 and
SES2 contains a pleckstrin (PLEK; 173570) homology (PH) domain followed
by a coiled-coil domain. The less conserved C-terminal portion of SES1
and SES2 is primarily unfolded and contains multiple SRC (190090)
homology-3 (SH3) domain-binding PxxP motifs. Immunofluorescence
microscopy of transfected COS-7 cells demonstrated colocalization of
human SES1 and SES2 with human OCRL in endosomes and in larger vesicles
expressing EEA1 (605070) and WDFY2 (610418).

Noakes et al. (2011) reported that the human FAM109B protein, which they
called IPIP27B, contains 259 amino acids. Immunofluorescence microscopy
of transfected human TERT-RPE1 cells demonstrated localization of
IPIP27B and IPIP27A (FAM109A) to recycling endosomes and to the
trans-Golgi network (TGN).

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments in COS-7 cells and
rat brain extracts, Swan et al. (2010) found that the C termini of human
SES1 and SES2 interacted with the ASH-RhoGAP-like domains of OCRL and
INPP5B. Mutation analysis showed that SES proteins interacted with OCRL
via a conserved C-terminal motif similar to that of another OCRL-binding
protein, APPL1 (604299). Swan et al. (2010) termed this motif the F&H
motif and found that a conserved phenylalanine was critical for OCRL
binding. Pull-down experiments in mouse brain extracts and transfected
COS-7 cells showed that missense mutations in OPRL that disrupted
binding to APPL1 in patients with Lowe syndrome (309000) or Dent
disease-2 (300555) also abolished binding of OCRL to SES1 and SES2. In
addition, APPL1 and the SES proteins could not simultaneously bind to
OCRL. Confocal microscopy suggested that APPL1 and the SES proteins
associated sequentially with endosomes and that the SES proteins
localized to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-positive vesicles. Swan et
al. (2010) proposed that Lowe syndrome and Dent disease-2 result from
perturbations at multiples sites within the endocytic pathway.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, pull-down assays, and native
coimmunoprecipitation experiments in HeLa cells, Noakes et al. (2011)
confirmed that the C termini of IPIP27A and IPIP27B bound the C-terminal
ASH and RhoGAP-like domains of OCRL1 and INPP5B. IPIP27A and IPIP27B
also formed homo- and heterodimers. Similar to the results of Swan et
al. (2010), Noakes et al. (2011) found that mutations in OCRL1
associated with Lowe syndrome abolished interaction with IPIP27A and
IPIP27B. Depletion of IPIP27A and/or IPIP27B via RNA interference in
HeLa cells caused enlargement of early endosomes, disrupted recycling of
transferrin receptor (TFRC; 190010), impaired the transfer of CIMPR
(IGF2R; 147280) from endosomes to the TGN, and caused missorting of
lysosomal hydrolases. Noakes et al. (2011) proposed that IPIP27A and
IPIP27B are key players in endocytic trafficking and that defects in
this process are responsible for the pathology of Lowe syndrome and Dent
disease-2.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the FAM109B gene to chromosome 22q13.2 based on an
alignment of the FAM109B sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC104176) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

180231	TITLE *180231 RETINOIC ACID-BINDING PROTEIN, CELLULAR, TYPE II; CRABP2
DESCRIPTION CRABP2 is highly expressed in human skin. Giguere et al. (1990) isolated
a cDNA encoding mouse Crabp-2 by a low stringency cloning strategy using
a probe from previously cloned CRABP1 cDNA (180230). MacGregor et al.
(1992) determined the genomic organization of the murine Crabp-2 gene
and performed a detailed analysis of its transcriptional unit. It was
shown to be approximately 4.6 kb long and divided into 4 exons in a
structure common to other members of the family of serum and cellular
retinoid-binding proteins. The chromosomal location of the Crabp-2 locus
was determined by interspecific backcross analysis using progeny derived
from matings of C57BL/6J and M. spretus. Mapping results indicated that
the gene is located on mouse chromosome 2 linked to muscle nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor alpha-chain (Acra) and catalase-1 (Cas-1).
MacGregor et al. (1992) suggested that the human homolog is located on
2q or 11p. Elder et al. (1992) localized the CRABP2 gene to 1q21 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Localization was confirmed by
hybridization of a CRABP2 cDNA clone against a human/mouse hybrid cell
line containing a t(1;6)(q21;q13) translocation chromosome.

Flagiello et al. (1997) mapped CRABP2 to 1q21.3 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

612969	TITLE *612969 TIGGER TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENT-DERIVED GENE 7; TIGD7
;;SANCHO
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNA transposons, such as Tiggers, are repetitive elements that move in
the genome by excision and reintegration without an RNA intermediate.
TIGD7 belongs to a family of genes derived from Tiggers (Smit and Riggs,
1996; Dou et al., 2004). For further information on Tiggers, see TIGD1
(612972).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a fetal brain cDNA library, Dou et
al. (2004) cloned full-length TIGD7. The deduced 511-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of 55.6 kD. Like other Tigger subfamily
proteins, TIGD7 contains a DDE domain, which is involved in catalysis of
DNA cleavage and the subsequent strand transfer reaction, and CENPBN and
CENPB domains, which are involved in DNA binding. PCR analysis detected
TIGD7 in all tissues examined, with highest expression in testis and
ovary. Database analysis suggested the existence of TIGD7 splice
variants.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dou et al. (2004) determined that the TIGD7 gene contains 2 exons and
spans 11.2 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Dou et al. (2004) mapped the TIGD7 gene to
chromosome 16p13.

606887	TITLE *606887 SULFITE OXIDASE; SUOX
DESCRIPTION Sulfite oxidase (EC 1.8.3.1) is the terminal enzyme in the oxidative
degradation pathway of sulfur-containing amino acids.

CLONING

Garrett et al. (1995) isolated a 2.4-kb cDNA clone of human sulfite
oxidase from a human liver cDNA library. The deduced 488-amino acid
protein has a molecular mass of approximately 52 kD and shows 88%
homology to the rat protein and 67% homology to the chicken protein.
Comparison of 3 sulfite oxidase sequences to several plant and fungal
nitrate reductase sequences revealed a single conserved cysteine with
highly conserved flanking sequences. Garrett et al. (1995) postulated
that the conserved cysteine is a ligand of molybdenum in sulfite oxidase
and nitrate reductase.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Kisker et al. (1997) determined the crystal structure of chicken liver
sulfite oxidase, which is homologous to the human protein, at
1.9-angstrom resolution. They found that each monomer of the dimeric
enzyme consists of 3 domains. At the active site, the Mo is
penta-coordinated by 3 sulfur ligands, 1 oxo group, and 1 water/hydroxo.
A sulfate molecule adjacent to the Mo identifies the substrate binding
pocket.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the sulfite
oxidase gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP sts-AA026389).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kisker et al. (1997) characterized 4 missense mutations in the SUOX gene
(606887.0001-606887.0004) in cell lines from patients with isolated
sulfite oxidase deficiency (272300). The crystallographic results
predicted that 2 of these mutations (arg160 to gln, 606887.0001 and
ala208 to asp, 606887.0002) are near the sulfate-binding site, whereas
the other mutations (ser370 to tyr, 606887.0003 and gly473 to asp,
606887.0004) occur within the domain mediating dimerization.

Johnson et al. (2002) identified 12 novel mutations in the SUOX gene in
patients with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency. These included 2
frameshift mutations, 2 homozygous nonsense mutations, and 8 missense
mutations.

Seidahmed et al. (2005) identified a 1-bp deletion in the SUOX gene
(606887.0005) in a male infant with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SULFITE OXIDASE DEFICIENCY, ISOLATED
SUOX, ARG160GLN

In a cell line from a patient with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency
(272300), Kisker et al. (1997) found a G-to-A substitution at nucleotide
479 of the cDNA of liver sulfite oxidase, resulting in an arg-to-gln
substitution at amino acid residue 160 (R160Q).

The R160Q mutation was identified by Garrett et al. (1998) in a
5-year-old girl with sulfite oxidase deficiency born of first-cousin
parents of Dutch descent. Recombinant protein containing the R160Q
mutation, expressed in Escherichia coli, contained its full complement
of molybdenum and heme, but exhibited 2% of native activity under
standard assay conditions. Absorption spectroscopy of the isolated
molybdenum domains of native sulfite oxidase and of the R160Q mutant
showed significant differences in the 480- and 350-nm absorption bands,
suggestive of altered geometry at the molybdenum center. Other studies
led to the proposal that under normal circumstances arg160 attracts the
anionic substrate sulfite to the binding site near the molybdenum.

substitution at amino acid 208.

substitution at amino acid 370.

.0004
SULFITE OXIDASE DEFICIENCY, ISOLATED

In a cell line from a patient with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency

SULFITE OXIDASE DEFICIENCY, ISOLATED
SUOX, 1-BP DEL, 1244G

In a male infant with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency (272300) from
a consanguineous Arab family, Seidahmed et al. (2005) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (1244delG) in the SUOX gene, predicting
a frameshift at amino acid 117 and resulting in a mutant protein of only
128 amino acids with total truncation of the molybdopterin and
dimerizing domains. The parents and 1 unaffected sib were heterozygous
for the deletion.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNA genes whose final
product is an approximately 22-nucleotide functional RNA molecule. They
play important roles in the regulation of target genes by binding to
complementary regions of messenger transcripts to repress their
translation or regulate degradation (summary by Griffiths-Jones et al.,
2006).

Two genes encoding miR33 isoforms exist in humans: miR33B, which is
present in intron 17 of the SREBP1 (184756) gene on chromosome 17, and
miR33A (612156), which is located in intron 16 of the SREBP2 (600481)
gene on chromosome 22. In mice, however, there is only 1 miR33 gene,
which is conserved with human miR33A, located within intron 15 of the
mouse Srebp2 gene. The mature miR33A and miR33B miRNAs differ at only 2
nucleotides. One of the targets of both miR33A and miR33B is the
cholesterol transporter ABCA1 (600046) (Najafi-Shoushtari et al., 2010).

CLONING

During an investigation of gene regulation by sterol regulatory
element-binding proteins (SREBPs), Najafi-Shoushtari et al. (2010)
identified the miR33B gene within intron 17 of the SREBP1 gene.
Najafi-Shoushtari et al. (2010) gave the sequence of mature miR33B as
GUGCAUUGCUGUUGCAUUGC. Using quantitative RT-PCR, they found that miR33B
was expressed in all human tissues examined, with highest levels in
brain, ovary, liver, prostate, heart, and cervix. Najafi-Shoushtari et
al. (2010) noted that miR33B appeared to be coexpressed with its host
gene, SREBP1.

MAPPING

The MIR33B gene resides on chromosome 17p11.2, within intron 17 of the
SREBP1 gene (Najafi-Shoushtari et al., 2010).

GENE FUNCTION

The sterol regulatory element-binding proteins SREBP1 and SREBP2 are key
transcription regulators of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis
and uptake. Najafi-Shoushtari et al. (2010) demonstrated that miRNA33A
and miRNA33B, embedded within introns of the SREBP2 and SREBP1 genes,
respectively, target adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter
A1 (ABCA1), an important regulator of high density lipoprotein (HDL)
synthesis and reverse cholesterol transport, for posttranscriptional
repression. Antisense inhibition of miRNA33 in mouse and human cell
lines caused upregulation of ABCA1 expression and increased cholesterol
efflux, and injection of mice on a western-type diet with locked nucleic
acid-antisense oligonucleotides resulted in elevated plasma HDL.
Najafi-Shoushtari et al. (2010) concluded that miRNA33 acts in concert
with the SREBP host genes to control cholesterol homeostasis.

MiR33A and miR33B are intronic miRNAs whose encoding regions are
embedded in the sterol response element-binding protein genes SREBF2 and
SREBF1, respectively. These miRNAs repress expression of the cholesterol
transporter ABCA1, which is a key regulator of HDL biogenesis. Studies
in mice suggested that antagonizing miR33a may be an effective strategy
for raising plasma HDL levels and providing protection against
atherosclerosis; however, extrapolating these findings to humans is
complicated by the fact that mice lack miR33b, which is present only in
the SREBF1 gene of medium and large mammals. Rayner et al. (2011) showed
in African green monkeys that systemic delivery of an anti-miRNA
oligonucleotide that targets both miR33a and miR33b increased hepatic
expression of ABCA1 and induced a sustained increase in plasma HDL
levels over 12 weeks. Notably, miR33 antagonism in this nonhuman primate
model also increased the expression of miR33 target genes involved in
fatty acid oxidation (CROT, 606090; CPT1A, 600528; HADHB, 143450; and
PRKAA1, 602739) and reduced the expression of genes involved in fatty
acid synthesis (SREBF1; FASN, 600212; ACLY, 108728; and ACACA, 200350),
resulting in a marked suppression of the plasma levels of very low
density lipoprotein (VLDL)-associated triglycerides, a finding that had
not previously been observed in mice. Rayner et al. (2011) concluded
that their results established, in a model that is highly relevant to
humans, that pharmacologic inhibition of miR33a and miR33b is a
promising therapeutic strategy to raise plasma HDL and lower VLDL
triglyceride levels for the treatment of dyslipidemias that increase
cardiovascular disease risk.

EVOLUTION

Brown et al. (2010) noted that the miR33A/B genes exhibit a remarkable
degree of evolutionary conservation. The precursor for mature miR33A is
found within the same intron of SREBP2 from many animal species,
including large and small mammals, chickens, and frogs. There is even a
perfectly conserved mature form of miR33A in the single SREBP-like gene
of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The latter is most remarkable
because insects do not synthesize sterols; their single SREBP gene
controls fatty acid production. Moreover, the fruit fly genome does not
contain ABCA1. In contrast to the uniform conservation of miR33A in
SREBP2, there is a gap in the evolutionary conservation of miR33B in
SREBP1. The SREBP1 genes from large mammals encode miR33B, but there is
no trace of miR33b in the Srebp1 genes of small mammals (rats and mice)
or chickens.
