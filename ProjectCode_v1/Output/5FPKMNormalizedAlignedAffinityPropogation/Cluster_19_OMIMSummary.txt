612647	TITLE *612647 RADIAL SPOKE HEAD 4, CHLAMYDOMONAS, HOMOLOG OF, A; RSPH4A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Radial spokes are regularly spaced along cilia, sperm, and flagella
axonemes and have a multisubunit 'stalk' and 'head' that form a signal
transduction scaffold between the central microtubule pair and dynein
(see 603297) arms. RSPH4A is predicted to be a component of the radial
spoke head based on homology with proteins in the biflagellate alga
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and other ciliates (Castleman et al., 2009).

CLONING

By genomewide linkage analysis and positional candidate gene analysis in
5 families with primary ciliary dyskinesia linked to chromosome 6q22
(CILD11; 612649) and central microtubule pair abnormalities, Castleman
et al. (2009) identified the RSPH4A and RSPH9 genes (612648). The
deduced RSPH4A protein contains 716 amino acids and shares about 30%
identity with the Chlamydomonas radial spoke head proteins Rsp4 and
Rsp6.

GENE STRUCTURE

Castleman et al. (2009) determined that the RSPH4A gene contains 6
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Castleman et al. (2009) mapped the RSPH4A
gene to chromosome 6q22.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 4 Pakistani families with CILD11, Castleman et
al. (2009) identified a homozygous mutation in the RSPH4A gene
(612647.0001). In affected members of a family of northern European
descent with CILD11, they identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the RSPH4A gene (612647.0001; 612647.0002). The patients
had classic respiratory features of CILD, but no situs abnormalities.
Electron microscopic studies showed complete absence of the central
microtubule pair of the ciliary axoneme. These findings suggested that
radial spoke proteins are not essential for embryonic nodal ciliary
function, which is important in the determination of left-right axis
development.

Kott et al. (2013) identified pathogenic mutations in the RSPH4A gene
(see, e.g., 612647.0004-612647.0005) in 7 (14%) of 48 families with with
a specific CILD phenotype characterized by ciliary central complex and
radial spoke defects. None of the patients had situs inversus.

In all 10 affected members of 4 Pakistani families with primary ciliary
dyskinesia-11 (612649), Castleman et al. (2009) identified a homozygous
460C-T transition in exon 1 of the RSPH4A gene, resulting in a
gln154-to-ter (Q154X) substitution. The patients had classic respiratory
features of CILD, but no situs abnormalities. Electron microscopic
studies showed complete absence of the central microtubule pair of the
ciliary axoneme.

CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 11, WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS
RSPH4A, GLN109TER

In affected individuals in a family of northern European descent with
CILD11 (612649), Castleman et al. (2009) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the RSPH4A gene: a 325C-T transition
in exon 1 resulting in a gln109-to-ter (Q109X) substitution, and a
1468C-T transition in exon 3 resulting in an arg490-to-ter (R490X;
612647.0003) substitution. The patients had classic respiratory features
of CILD, but no situs abnormalities. Electron microscopic studies showed
complete absence of the central microtubule pair of the ciliary axoneme.

In a family with primary CILD11 (612649) without situs inversus, Kott et
al. (2013) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the RSPH4A
gene: a 1-bp deletion (667delA), resulting in premature termination
(Ser223AlafsTer15), and a 1-bp deletion (c.1720delA; 612647.0005),
resulting premature termination (Thr424GlnfsTer19). Transmission
electron microscopy showed that a variable proportion of cilia on
respiratory epithelial cells had central complex defects. Radial spokes
were absent in cilia with no central microtubule complex.

613648	TITLE *613648 MATERNALLY EXPRESSED GENE 8; MEG8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for human orthologs of imprinted ovine genes, Charlier et
al. (2001) identified MEG8. They noted that MEG8 contains a high degree
of interspersed repeats and, while represented by several ESTs, appears
to lack a protein-coding sequence. RT-PCR of ovine tissues revealed
highest expression in skeletal muscle and kidney. Meg8 was maternally
expressed in sheep.

By searching for human orthologs of an imprinted small nucleolar RNA
(snoRNA) gene from rat chromosome 6 in a syntenic region of human
chromosome 14, Cavaille et al. (2002) identified SNORD112 (613649),
which they called 14q(0), within an intron of the MEG8 gene. Downstream
of MEG8, they identified 9 tandem copies of SNORD113 (see 613650)
followed by 31 tandem copies of SNORD114 (see 613651), which they called
the 14q(I) and 14q(II) clusters, respectively. Each of the 70- to
75-nucleotide snoRNAs contains the characteristic C/D-prime/C-prime/D
motifs and a terminal 5-prime-to-3-prime stem structure with a conserved
sequence. RT-PCR of several overlapping clones suggested that most of
the snoRNA genes originate from introns of a large RNA that includes
exons of the upstream MEG8 gene in addition to exons that overlap the
SNORD113 and SNORD114 gene clusters. This large transcript appears to be
devoid of significant protein-coding potential. Northern blot analysis
revealed highest SNORD112 expression in brain and uterus, with lower
expression in heart and weak expression in other tissues examined. This
expression pattern was identical to that of SNORD113 and SNORD114.

GENE STRUCTURE

Charlier et al. (2001) determined that the MEG8 gene contains at least 8
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Cavaille et al. (2002) mapped the MEG8
gene to chromosome 14q32.

601621	TITLE *601621 T-BOX 3; TBX3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the course of studying the 12q24.1 region where linkage studies
indicated that the Holt-Oram syndrome (142900) is located, Li et al.
(1997) and Basson et al. (1997) identified the genes TBX3 and TBX5
(601620). The latter gene was found to be the site of mutations
responsible for Holt-Oram syndrome.

The cloning of new TBX3 cDNAs allowed Bamshad et al. (1999) to complete
the characterization of the TBX3 gene and to identify alternatively
transcribed TBX3 transcripts, including 1 that interrupts the T-box. The
complete open reading frame of the TBX3 gene encodes a predicted
723-amino acid protein, of which 255 amino acids are encoded by newly
identified exons. Comparison of other T-box genes to TBX3 indicated
regions of substantial homology outside the DNA-binding domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Sowden et al. (2001) examined the role of Drosophila 'optomotor blind'
(omb)-related T-box genes in the development of human and mouse retina.
Murine Tbx2 (600747), Tbx3, and Tbx5 and human TBX2 cDNAs were isolated
from retina cDNA libraries by hybridization to the Drosophila omb gene.
Human and mouse TBX2, TBX3, and TBX5 were expressed asymmetrically
across the embryonic neural retina, with highest levels of mRNA within
dorsal and peripheral retina. The dorsoventral gradient of TBX2
expression disappeared before the ganglion cell layer (GCL) formed. Its
expression became restricted to the inner neuroblastic retina and later
to the GCL and inner nuclear layer (INL). The dorsal expression domains
of TBX5 and TBX3 were maintained during formation of the GCL. As the
retina matured, TBX3 expression was restricted to the INL, and TBX5 was
expressed within the GCL. The authors concluded that the expression
patterns of TBX2, TBX3, and TBX5 within the developing retina support
the idea that the encoded transcription factors play a role in providing
positional information important for topographic mapping in
differentiation of distinct cell types across the laminar axis of the
retina.

Hoogaars et al. (2007) found that the sinoatrial node of mouse heart was
formed by proliferation of Tbx3-positive precursor cells and not from
bordering atrial cells. Tbx3 deficiency resulted in expansion of atrial
gene expression into the sinoatrial node domain and partial loss of
sinoatrial node-specific gene expression. Ectopic expression of Tbx3 in
mice repressed the atrial phenotype and imposed the pacemaker phenotype
on the atria, resulting in development of functional ectopic pacemakers.

Niwa et al. (2009) showed that 2 LIF (159540) signaling pathways are
each connected to the core circuitry required to maintain pluripotency
via different transcription factors. In mouse embryonic stem cells, Klf4
(602253) is mainly activated by the Jak-Stat3 pathway and preferentially
activates Sox2 (184429), whereas Tbx3 is preferentially regulated by the
phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase-Akt and mitogen-activated protein
kinase pathways and predominantly stimulates Nanog (607937). In the
absence of Lif, artificial expression of Klf4 or Tbx3 was sufficient to
maintain pluripotency while maintaining the expression of Oct3/4
(164177). Notably, overexpression of Nanog supported Lif-independent
self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells in the absence of Klf4 and
Tbx3 activity. Therefore, Niwa et al. (2009) concluded that KLF4 and
TBX3 are involved in mediating LIF signaling to the core circuitry but
are not directly associated with the maintenance of pluripotency,
because embryonic stem cells keep pluripotency without their expression
in the particular context.

Using genetic lineage analysis, knockout studies, and explant assays,
Wiese et al. (2009) found that Tbx18 (604613) was required to establish
the large head structure of the mouse sinoatrial node from mesenchymal
precursors. Subsequently, Tbx3 induced expression of pacemaker genes for
pacemaker function.

Han et al. (2010) showed that the transcription factor Tbx3
significantly improves the quality of induced pluripotent stem (iPS)
cells. iPS cells generated with Klf4 and Tbx3 were superior in both germ
cell contribution to the gonads and germline transmission frequency.
However, global gene expression profiling could not distinguish between
the 2 groups of iPS cells. Genomewide chromatin immunoprecipitation
sequencing analysis of Tbx3-binding sites in embryonic stem cells
suggested that Tbx3 regulates pluripotency-associated and reprogramming
factors, in addition to sharing many common downstream regulatory
targets with Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and Smad1 (601595). Han et al. (2010)
concluded that their study underscored the intrinsic qualitative
differences between iPS cells generated by different methods, and
highlighted the need to rigorously characterize iPS cells beyond in
vitro studies.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yi et al. (2000) determined that the TBX3 gene contains at least 6 exons
and spans more than 9.0 kb.

MAPPING

The human TBX3 and TBX5 genes map to chromosome 12q24.1, and the murine
homologs, Tbx3 and Tbx5, map to chromosome 5 (Li et al., 1997; Basson et
al., 1997).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Li et al. (1997) pointed out that TBX3 may be a candidate gene for
Noonan syndrome (163950) and ulnar-mammary syndrome (UMS; 181450). The
latter possibility indeed proved to be the case; Bamshad et al. (1997)
demonstrated mutations in TBX3 in 2 families with ulnar-mammary
syndrome. Each mutation was predicted to cause haploinsufficiency of
TBX3, implying that critical levels of this transcription factor are
required for morphogenesis of several organs. Limb abnormalities of
ulnar-mammary syndrome involve posterior elements. Mutations in TBX5
cause anterior limb abnormalities in Holt-Oram syndrome. Because of
similarities in structure and function of TBX3 and TBX5 and because of
close linkage, Bamshad et al. (1997) proposed that these genes
originated from a common ancestral gene, each having acquired specific
complementary roles in patterning the mammalian upper limb.

Bamshad et al. (1999) identified novel mutations in the TBX3 gene in all
of 8 newly reported families with UMS, including 5 mutations downstream
of the region encoding the T-box. This suggested that a domain (or
domains) outside the T-box was highly conserved and important for the
function of TBX3. Bamshad et al. (1999) found no obvious phenotypic
differences between those who had missense mutations and those who had
deletions or frameshifts.

To determine how C-terminal mutations may affect transcription, Carlson
et al. (2001) created a series of fusion proteins to map regions that
conferred transcriptional activity, nuclear localization, and
DNA-binding properties of Tbx3. Tbx3 binds the canonic brachyury binding
site as a monomer and represses transcription. A key repression domain
(RD1) resides in the Tbx3 C terminus that can function as a portable
repression domain. Most UMS-associated C-terminal mutants lack the RD1
and exhibit decreased or loss of transcriptional repression activity. A
cluster of basic amino acids at residues 292-297 serves as a nuclear
localization signal. Two C-terminal truncation mutants exhibited
increased rates of protein decay. The RD1 repression domain of Tbx3 was
also shown to be capable of immortalizing primary embryo fibroblasts.

Borozdin et al. (2006) reported a Czech mother and 2 daughters who were
diagnosed with Holt-Oram syndrome, in whom they identified a 2.19 to
2.27-Mb contiguous deletion encompassing the TBX5 and TBX3 genes.
Clinical reexamination confirmed the presence of features of
ulnar-mammary syndrome that were previously unrecognized. Borozdin et
al. (2006) noted that the contiguous deletion also included the RBM19
gene, but commented that it was unlikely to contribute to or modify the
phenotype since all the anomalies present in the affected individuals
could be explained by either TBX5 or TBX3 haploinsufficiency.

Klopocki et al. (2006) sequenced the TBX3 gene in a 3.5-year-old girl
with an ulnar-mammary-like phenotype, dysmorphic facies, and mental
retardation, but did not detect any mutation. Microarray CGH revealed
heterozygosity for an interstitial 1.28-Mb deletion on chromosome
12q24.21, encompassing the TBX3 gene. The deletion and TBX3
haploinsufficiency were confirmed by FISH. Neither parent carried the
deletion. Klopocki et al. (2006) stated that this was the first
description of TBX3 haploinsufficiency caused by a genomic deletion in a
patient with ulnar-mammary syndrome and suggested that the facial
changes and mental retardation observed in this patient might be due to
involvement of neighboring genes.

In a boy and his mother with ulnar-mammary syndrome, Linden et al.
(2009) identified heterozygosity for a nonsense mutation in the TBX3
gene (601621.0005).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using the development of the 4-digit chick leg as a model system, Suzuki
et al. (2004) studied the role of Tbx2 and Tbx3 in specifying digit
identities along the anterior-posterior axis. Misexpression of Tbx2 and
Tbx3 induced posterior homeotic transformation of digit III to digit IV
and digit II to digit III, respectively. Conversely, misexpression of
constitutively active mutants induced anterior transformation. In both
cases, alterations in the expression of several markers, including Bmp2
(112261), Shh (600725), and HoxD genes (see 142987), were observed. In
addition, Tbx2 and Tbx3 rescued Noggin (602991)-mediated inhibition of
interdigital BMP signaling, which was pivotal in establishing digit
identities. Suzuki et al. (2004) concluded that, in the developing
chick, Tbx3 specifies digit III and the combination of Tbx2 and Tbx3
specifies digit IV, acting together with the interdigital BMP signaling
cascade.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ULNAR-MAMMARY SYNDROME
TBX3, 1-BP DEL, 227T

In a mother and son with ulnar-mammary syndrome (181450), Bamshad et al.
(1997) found that the TBX3 gene had deletion of nucleotide 227, a
thymidine, resulting in shift of the reading frame and a premature
termination codon after 11 novel amino acids. A hand x-ray in the mother
showed complete absence of the fourth digit (metacarpal and phalanges)
and fusion of the capitate and hamate bones on the right. The mutated
protein in this family was predicted to encode a markedly truncated
protein containing only 86 amino acids and lacking the entire T-box
domain. This mutant protein should be incapable of binding DNA. Affected
members of this family demonstrated limb and apocrine anomalies.

.0002
ULNAR-MAMMARY SYNDROME
TBX3, IVS2DS, G-C, +1

In a mother and daughter with ulnar-mammary syndrome (181450), Bamshad
et al. (1997) demonstrated heterozygosity for a G-to-C transversion in
the first nucleotide of intron 2. This substitution altered the
consensus splice donor site and was predicted to alter gene splicing.
This family exhibited limb, apocrine, and genital anomalies.

.0003
ULNAR-MAMMARY SYNDROME
TBX3, LYS273TER

In a Japanese mother and her 2 sons with ulnar-mammary syndrome
(181450), Sasaki et al. (2002) found a heterozygous 817A-T mutation in
exon 4 of the TBX3 gene, leading to a lys273-to-ter substitution. The
mutation is expected to impair the DNA-binding capacity of the TBX3
protein.

.0004
ULNAR-MAMMARY SYNDROME
TBX3, 1-BP INS, 88A

Wollnik et al. (2002) reported a large Turkish family in which 10
members spanning 3 generations had autosomal dominant ulnar-mammary
syndrome (181450). The phenotypic expression of the disease was highly
variable among the affected family members showing posterior (ulnar or
postaxial) limb deficiencies and/or duplications, mammary gland
hypoplasia, apocrine dysfunction, and dental and genital abnormalities.
Mutation analysis identified a 1-bp insertion (88insA) in the TBX3 gene.
The truncated protein lacked almost all functionally important parts of
TBX3 and probably had complete loss of function.

.0005
ULNAR-MAMMARY SYNDROME
TBX3, GLN331TER

In a boy and his mother with ulnar-mammary syndrome (UMS; 181450),
Linden et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a 991C-T transition
in exon 5 of the TBX3 gene, resulting in a gln331-to-ter (Q331X)
substitution. The boy had phenotypic features not theretofore described
in UMS, including hypoplastic anterior pituitary and ectopic posterior
pituitary gland, ventricular septal defect, and cardiac conduction
defects consistent with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (see 194200). In
addition, the boy's mother did not show the classic features of UMS,
supporting the variable expressivity of UMS within the same family.

103020	TITLE *103020 ADENYLATE KINASE 2; AK2
;;ADENYLATE KINASE, MITOCHONDRIAL MYOKINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Nucleoside monophosphate kinases, including adenylate kinases, catalyze
the reversible phosphorylation between nucleoside triphosphates and
monophosphates.

CLONING

Bruns and Regina (1977) analyzed the subcellular compartmentalization of
adenylate kinase-2 (EC 2.7.4.3) in HeLa cells, mouse RAG cells, and
RAG-human hybrids expressing human AK2. The results indicated that AK2
is a mitochondrial enzyme.

Noma et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding human adenylate kinase-2 from
a HeLa cell cDNA library, using bovine AK2 cDNA as probe. Two
transcripts were identified: one, designated AK2A, encodes a deduced
239-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 26.5 kD, and
the other, designated AK2B, encodes a deduced 232-amino acid protein
with a predicted molecular mass of 25.6 kD. Northern blot analysis
demonstrated 3 strong hybridizing signals of 0.9 (AK2A), 1.7 (AK2B), and
3.5 kb, with high expression in liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and
pancreas, moderate expression in kidney, placenta, and brain, and weak
expression in lung. However, Western blot analysis showed high levels of
AK2 protein in liver, heart, and kidney, low levels in lung, and
undetectable levels in brain and skeletal muscle.

MAPPING

The existence of a second adenylate kinase locus linked to PGM1 and
peptidase C, i.e., on chromosome 1, was suggested by cell hybridization
studies by Van Cong et al. (1972). The Goss-Harris method of mapping
combines features of recombinational study in families and synteny tests
in hybrid cells. As applied to chromosome 1, the method shows that AK2
and UMPK are distal to PGM1 and that the order of the loci is PGM1:
UMPK: (AK2, alpha-FUC): ENO1 (Goss and Harris, 1977). Carritt et al.
(1982) presented evidence that AK2 is in 1p34.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (2007) showed that intrinsic apoptosis in human cells that
was induced by the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide or the antibiotic
staurosporine, but not by FAS ligand (TNFSF6; 134638) or TRAIL (TNFSF10;
603598), caused translocation of AK2 from mitochondria to the cytoplasm,
followed by formation of a complex between AK2, FADD (602457), and
CASP10 (601762). Yeast 2-hybrid analysis, protein pull-down assays, and
immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the N- and C-terminal domains
of AK2, which include nucleoside- and substrate-binding domains,
respectively, bound the C-terminal death domain of FADD. AK2 binding
promoted association of CASP10 with FADD, and addition of purified AK2
protein to cell extracts induced activation of CASP10 via FADD, leading
to subsequent activation of CASP9 (602234) and CASP3 (600636). Apoptosis
through the AK2 complex did not correlate with the adenylate kinase
activity of AK2, did not require CASP8 (601763)-mediated apoptotic
responses, and did not involve mitochondrial cytochrome c release.
Immunodepletion or knockdown of AK2, FADD, or CASP10 abrogated
etoposide-induced apoptosis, and AK2 complexes were not observed in
several etoposide-resistant human tumor cell lines that were deficient
in expression of FADD, CASP10, or CASP3. In contrast to the findings in
human cells, etoposide-induced apoptosis was observed in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts that lacked Fadd expression. Since mice also lack Casp10,
Lee et al. (2007) concluded that mice lack an apoptotic pathway
comparable to the AK2-FADD-CASP10 pathway in humans.

Pannicke et al. (2009) showed that knockdown of zebrafish ak2 also leads
to aberrant leukocyte development, demonstrating the evolutionarily
conserved role of AK2. They concluded that their results provide in vivo
evidence for AK2 selectivity in leukocyte differentiation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 6 affected individuals from 5 families segregating reticular
dysgenesis (267500), Pannicke et al. (2009) identified 6 causative
mutations in homozygous or compound heterozygous state
(103020.0001-103020.0006).

Lagresle-Peyrou et al. (2009) identified biallelic mutations in AK2
(103020.0007-103020.0013) in 7 individuals with reticular dysgenesis.
These mutations resulted in absent or strongly decreased protein
expression. The authors then demonstrated that restoration of AK2
expression in the bone marrow cells of individuals with reticular
dysgenesis overcomes the neutrophil differentiation arrest, underlining
its specific requirement in the development of a restricted set of
hematopoietic lineages. Finally, Lagresle-Peyrou et al. (2009)
established that AK2 is specifically expressed in the stria vascularis
region of the inner ear, which provides an explanation for the
sensorineural deafness in these individuals. Lagresle-Peyrou et al.
(2009) concluded that their results identified a previously unknown
mechanism involved in regulation of hematopoietic cell differentiation
in one of the most severe human immunodeficiency syndromes.

was consanguineous, Lagresle-Peyrou et al. (2009) identified
homozygosity for an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 546 in exon 5 of the
AK2 gene, resulting in an asp-to-gly substitution in codon 165 (D165G)

610777	TITLE *610777 NEUROGUIDIN; NGDN
;;NGD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Neuroguidin is an EIF4E (133440)-binding protein that interacts with
CPEB (607342) and functions as a translational regulatory protein during
development of the vertebrate nervous system (Jung et al., 2006).

CLONING

Jung et al. (2006) cloned mouse Ngdn cDNA based on its homology with
Drosophila ngdn. The mouse and human protein sequences are 89%
identical. The 311-amino acid human NGDN protein has 3 conserved
N-terminal EIF4E-binding motifs. Northern blot analysis showed Ngdn
expression in mouse cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, kidney, spleen,
ovary, and testis. Western blot analysis detected Ngdn protein in all
mouse tissues except muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation and cap column assays in mouse cerebellum
extracts, Jung et al. (2006) determined that Ngdn physically interacts
with EIF4E. Using Ngdn EIF4E-binding motif deletion mutants, they showed
that all 3 motifs contribute to binding and can compensate for one
another. In Xenopus oocytes, Ngdn coimmunoprecipitated with CPEB, and
Ngdn inhibited translation of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element
(CPE)-containing mRNAs in oocytes. Whole-mount in situ hybridization of
developing Xenopus embryos detected ngdn mRNA in the animal pole
blastomeres of the 4-cell embryo and in the neural crest and neural
folds of the neurula-stage embryo. Injection of antisense
morpholino-oligonucleotides against ngdn resulted in disrupted neural
tube closure and neural crest migration.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the NGDN
gene to chromosome 14 (TMAP SHGC-62927).

602949	TITLE *602949 SIN3-ASSOCIATED POLYPEPTIDE, 18-KD; SAP18
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

An important event in gene expression is the modification of histone
proteins. Hyperacetylation of core histones has been correlated with
gene activation, and hypoacetylation with gene repression. SIN3 (see
607776)-mediated repression of transcription involves the modification
of histone polypeptides. Zhang et al. (1997) purified a SIN3-containing
complex from HeLa cells and found that SIN3 was associated with SAP18,
SAP30 (603378), RBBP4 (602923), RBBP7 (300825), and the histone
deacetylases HDAC1 (601241) and HDAC2 (605164). By searching sequence
databases with SAP18 peptide sequences, the authors identified several
human SAP18 expressed sequence tags from which they constructed a
full-length hybrid SAP18 cDNA. The predicted 153-amino acid SAP18
protein is 49% identical to a C. elegans SAP18 homolog. SAP18 has a
molecular mass of 18 kD by SDS-PAGE. SAP18 was expressed in all tissues
analyzed.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (1997) demonstrated that SAP18 directly interacts with SIN3
and enhances SIN3-mediated transcriptional repression. They observed
that SAP18 directs the formation of a repressive complex when tethered
to the promoter.

603960	TITLE *603960 CALICIN; CCIN
DESCRIPTION In mammalian sperm, the dense cytoplasmic webs surrounding the nuclei
contain a complex structure called the perinuclear theca. In bovine
sperm heads, the perinuclear theca is subdivided into the anterior
subacrosomal layer and the posterior calyx, a funnel-shaped, dense, and
stable structure tightly surrounding the posterior part of the nucleus
on its inner side and apposed to the plasma membrane on the outer side.
Longo et al. (1987) determined that 2 kinds of basic proteins are the
major constituents of the thecal structure: calicin, a 60-kD protein
localized almost exclusively to the calyx, and a group of multiple-band
polypeptides (MBPs or cylicins; see 300768) that are found both in the
calyx and the subacrosomal layer. They speculated that during
spermiogenesis, these insoluble basic proteins contribute to the
formation of the perinuclear theca as an architectural element involved
in the shape changes and the intimate association of the nucleus with
the acrosome and the plasma membrane.

Von Bulow et al. (1995) purified calicin from bull sperm and determined
a partial protein sequence. By PCR analysis of testis cDNA with
oligonucleotide primers based on the calicin protein sequence, they
isolated bovine and human cDNAs encoding calicin. The predicted bovine
protein contains 588 amino acids and has a calculated pI of 8.1. The
partial human cDNA encodes a protein that starts at a position
corresponding to the fourth amino acid of bovine calicin. Overall, the 2
calicins are 91% identical. There are 3 consecutive repeats in the
middle of the calicin protein. Sequence comparisons revealed that
calicin shares homology with the Drosophila kelch protein, which is
associated with the actin-rich intercellular bridges (ring canals) in
the egg chamber that connect the oocyte and the nurse cells. Von Bulow
et al. (1995) noted that calicin is missing or is arranged in a
dramatically different pattern in the heads of malformed human
spermatozoa such as teratozoospermias with 'round-headed' sperm or with
other 'postacrosomal sheath defects.'

;;T2R30;;
T2R47
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TAS2R30 belongs to a family of intronless genes that encode highly
related bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs). TAS2Rs are G protein-coupled
receptors, which are characterized by 7 transmembrane domains (summary
by Fischer et al., 2005). For further information on the TAS2R gene
family, see 604791.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Fischer et al. (2005) mapped the TAS2R30
gene, which they called T2R47, to a small TAS2R gene cluster on
chromosome 1. However, Hartz (2011) mapped the TAS2R30 gene to
chromosome 12p13.2 based on an alignment of the TAS2R30 sequence
(GenBank GENBANK AY724940) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

SPHINGOLIPID DELTA-4-DESATURASE/C4-HYDROXYLASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, followed by RT-PCR of human epidermal keratinocyte
RNA, Mizutani et al. (2004) cloned DEGS2. The deduced 323-amino acid
protein has a predicted molecular mass of 37.2 kD and shares 86.4%
identity and 91.9% similarity with mouse Des2. DEGS2 belongs to the
desaturase/hydroxylase superfamily, characterized by 3 conserved
histidine boxes. Compared to DEGS1, DEGS2 has a fourth histidine box and
a variation in the second amino acid residue of the 3 conserved
histidine boxes. Using in vitro assays in HEK293 cells, DEGS2 exhibited
dihydroceramide hydroxylase activity. Northern blot analysis of adult
human tissues detected a 1.8-kb transcript with highest expression in
skin, moderate expression in kidney, kidney, large intestine, and small
intestine, weak expression in brain and lung, and no expression in
heart, liver, spleen, skeletal muscle, thymus, or placenta. Using RT-PCR
analysis, Mizutani et al. (2004) found that expression of DEGS2 mRNA was
regulated during in vitro keratinocyte differentiation and that DEGS2
transcription was not detected at day 0 or 3 days after differentiation,
but was found at day 6 and had increased by day 9.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the DEGS2
gene to chromosome 14 (TMAP RH47801).

607391	TITLE *607391 SINGLE-STRANDED DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 4; SSBP4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching with the SSBP2 (607389) sequence as probe,
Castro et al. (2002) identified 2 additional members of the SSBP gene
family, SSBP3 (607390) and SSBP4. All 3 SSBP genes share homology with
the chicken gene CSDP, which encodes a protein that binds
single-stranded pyrimidine-rich mirror-repeat elements with high
specificity. The deduced 364-amino acid SSBP4 protein shares 73% and 72%
sequence identity with human SSBP2 and SSBP3, respectively. SSBP family
members share a highly conserved N terminus followed by a glycine- and
proline-rich domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Castro et al. (2002) determined that the SSBP2, SSBP3, and SSBP4 genes
all contain 17 exons and have identical intron/exon boundaries,
suggesting duplication from a common ancestral gene. They also
identified alternative splicing and additional internal exons for all 3
genes, suggesting the existence of multiple isoforms for each protein.
The SSBP4 gene spans less than 25 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Castro et al. (2002) mapped the SSBP4 gene
to chromosome 19p13.1, between markers D19S899 and D19S407.
