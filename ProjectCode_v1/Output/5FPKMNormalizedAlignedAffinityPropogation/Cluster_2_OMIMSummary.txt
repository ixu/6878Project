DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Intronic regions of ribosomal protein genes can harbor noncoding small
nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), like SNORD83A, which are generated during
pre-mRNA processing. snoRNAs form part of the small nucleolar
ribonucleoprotein particles (snoRNPs) involved in pre-rRNA processing
and modification. snoRNAs of the box C/D class, like SNORD83A, function
in 2-prime-O-ribose methylation of rRNAs (Duga et al., 2000).

CLONING

Duga et al. (2000) identified several snoRNAs, including SNORD83A, which
they called U83A, within introns of the bovine and human RPL3 (604163)
genes. U83A originates from intron 5 of RPL3. The 95-nucleotide U83A has
a region complementary to 18S RNA and contains canonical motifs of box
C/D snoRNAs. Sequence analysis suggested that U83A forms a stem-loop
structure through basepairing of the 5-prime and 3-prime terminal
sequences. In this model, the loop contains boxes C and D on either side
of the stem, with the sequence complementary to 18S rRNA located
immediately upstream of box D. Northern blot analysis using a bovine
probe detected U83A expression in HeLa cells, mouse fibroblasts, and
bovine brain. RT-PCR detected U83A expression in a bovine kidney cell
line.

MAPPING

Duga et al. (2000) identified SNORD83A within intron 5 of the RPL3 gene
on chromosome 22q.

611114	TITLE *611114 MICRO RNA 150; MIR150
;;miRNA150;;
MIRN150
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIRN150, are 20- to 24-nucleotide noncoding
RNAs found in animals and plants. These small RNAs regulate gene
expression at the translational level through interactions with their
target mRNAs. MIRN150 is a hematopoietic cell-specific miRNA (Zhou et
al., 2007).

CLONING

Lagos-Quintana et al. (2002) cloned mouse miRNA150. Using miRNA arrays
and quantitative RT-PCR analysis, Zhou et al. (2007) detected abundant
expression of mouse miR150 in lymph nodes. Expression was also high in
spleen, with lower levels in thymus, heart, and brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhou et al. (2007) found that expression of mouse miR150 increased
during B- and T-cell development. Overexpression of miR150 in
hematopoietic stem cells, followed by bone marrow transplantation,
impaired formation of mature B cells, but not other lymphoid and myeloid
cell populations. Premature expression of miR150 blocked transition from
pro-B to pre-B lymphocytes. Zhou et al. (2007) proposed that miR150
likely downregulates mRNAs important for pre- and pro-B cell formation
and function.

Using loss- and gain-of-function gene targeting approaches for Mir150
with conditional and partial ablation of Myb (189990) in mice, Xiao et
al. (2007) showed that Mir150 controlled Myb expression in vivo in a
dose-dependent manner over a narrow range of miRNA and Myb
concentrations, dramatically affecting lymphocyte development and the
humoral immune response. They concluded that MYB is a critical target of
MIR150.

Using microarray and Northern blot analysis, Chang et al. (2008) showed
that MIRN150 was among several miRNAs downregulated by MYC (190080) in
mouse and human B-cell lymphoma cell lines. The expression of MIRN150
strongly inhibited tumor formation by lymphoma cells following injection
into immunodeficient mice.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the MIRN150 gene to chromosome 19q13.33 based on an
alignment of the mature MIRN150 sequence (UCUCCCAACCCUUGUACCAGUG) with
the genomic sequence (build 36.1).
