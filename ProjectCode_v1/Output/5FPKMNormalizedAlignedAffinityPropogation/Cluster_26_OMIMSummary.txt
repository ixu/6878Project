ADIPSIN; ADN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CFD gene encodes complement factor D, a serine protease that acts in
the alternative complement pathway to complete the formation of the C3
convertase enzyme by cleaving factor B (CFB; 138470) bound to C3b
(120700), yielding C3bBb. Factor D is the initial obligatory and
rate-limiting catalytic component in the alternative complement pathway
(summary by White et al., 1992 and Biesma et al., 2001).

CLONING

White et al. (1992) isolated clones corresponding to the human CFD gene
from a human glioma cDNA library. The deduced mature protein contains
228 amino acids and was determined to be the same as the adipsin protein
identified in mice (Rosen et al., 1989). Northern blot analysis detected
a 1.1-kb mRNA transcript in adipocytes, monocytes, and macrophages. The
recombinant protein showed enzymatic activity of complement factor D,
cleaving factor B only when B was complexed with activated component
C3b. The findings suggested that adipose tissue may have a role in
immune system biology.

GENE FUNCTION

White et al. (1992) found that adipose cells are the main source of
factor D. There is a gradient in the concentration of factor D in the
fat cells of the body; more is present in the upper than in the lower
half of the body (Mathieson and Peters, 1997). In a review of the
complement system, Walport (2001) noted that the C3 nephritic
autoantibody can be associated with acquired partial lipodystrophy
(613913). The C3 nephritic autoantibody stabilizes the C3bBb C3
convertase that forms in the immediate vicinity of adipocytes. The
abnormally stabilized enzyme may then cleave enough C3 to allow assembly
of the membrane-attack complex, which lyses adipocytes. The pattern of
fat loss, which involves the upper half of the body, may reflect the
content of factor D.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Forneris et al. (2010) presented crystal structures of the proconvertase
C3bB at 4-angstrom resolution and its complex with factor D at
3.5-angstrom resolution. Their data showed how factor B (138470) binding
to C3b forms an open 'activation' state of C3bB. Factor D specifically
binds the open conformation of factor B through a site distant from the
catalytic center and is activated by the substrate, which displaces
factor D's self-inhibitory loop. This concerted proteolytic mechanism,
which if cofactor-dependent and substrate-induced, restricts complement
amplification to C3b-tagged target cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Factor D is unusual among serum proteins in having a single-banded
pattern in isoelectric focusing. Hobart and Lachmann (1976) found a
variant in 3 persons of West African parentage (2 Nigerians and a West
Indian) among 120 tested. No variants were found among 115 British and
26 Asian Indians. The presence of the variant band was associated with
weakening of the normal band. Both bands were of equal strength (Martin
et al., 1976).

- Complement Factor D Deficiency

In a Dutch family with factor D deficiency (CFDD; 613912), Biesma et al.
(2001) identified a homozygous mutation in the CFD gene (134350.0001).
The proband was a 23-year-old woman who presented with septic shock due
to Neisseria meningitidis in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. A deceased
family member had a history of recurrent bacterial meningitis.
Laboratory studies showed absence of factor D activity in the proband.
However, 3 other family members who did not have a history of recurrent
infections also showed absence of factor D activity.

Sprong et al. (2006) described the clinical course of meningococcal
disease in 2 children of a Turkish family with a novel factor D gene
mutation (134350.0002) leading to undetectable factor D plasma
concentrations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Adipsin is a serine protease that is secreted by adipocytes into the
bloodstream. It is deficient in several animal models of obesity. Rosen
et al. (1989) purified recombinant mouse adipsin and studied its
biochemical and enzymatic properties. Activated adipsin had little or no
proteolytic activity toward most substrates but had the same activity as
human complement factor D.

To assess the contribution of the alternative pathway in complement
activation and host defense and its possible role in the regulation of
systemic energy balance in vivo, Xu et al. (2001) generated factor
D-deficient mice by gene targeting. Mutant mice had no apparent
abnormality in development and their body weights were similar to those
of factor D-sufficient littermates. Complement activation could not be
initiated in the serum of deficient mice by alternative pathway
activators, namely, rabbit erythrocytes and zymosan. Injection of cobra
venom factor caused a profound and reproducible reduction in serum C3
levels, whereas, as expected, there was no C3 reduction in factor
B-deficient mice treated similarly. Studies of C3 and factor B
activation in vitro by cobra venom factor demonstrated that in factor
D-deficient serum the alpha chain of C3 was cleaved gradually over a
period of 60 minutes without detectable cleavage of factor B. Kinetics
of opsonization of Streptococcus pneumoniae by C3 fragments was much
slower in factor D-deficient serum, suggesting a significant
contribution of the alternative pathway to antibacterial host defense
early after infection.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COMPLEMENT FACTOR D DEFICIENCY
CFD, SER42TER

In 5 affected members of a consanguineous Dutch family with complement
factor D deficiency (613912), Biesma et al. (2001) identified a
homozygous C-to-A transversion in the CFD gene, resulting in a
ser42-to-ter (S42X) substitution. The proband was a 23-year-old woman
who presented with septic shock due to Neisseria meningitidis in blood
and CSF. A deceased family member had a history of recurrent bacterial
meningitis. Laboratory studies showed absence of factor D activity in
the proband. However, 3 other family members who did not have a history
of recurrent infections also showed absence of factor D activity.

.0002
COMPLEMENT FACTOR D DEFICIENCY
CFD, VAL213GLY AND CYS214ARG

In a sister and brother, born of consanguineous parents, with invasive
meningococcal disease due to complement factor D deficiency (613912)
Sprong et al. (2006) identified homozygosity for a mutant allele
containing 2 missense mutations in cis in the CFD gene: a 638T-G
transversion, resulting in a val213-to-gly (V213G) substitution, and a
640T-C transition, resulting in a cys214-to-arg (C214R) substitution.
These mutations both occurred in conserved residues, and the C214R
change destroyed an internal disulfide bond between 2 conserved
cysteines. The unaffected parents and an unaffected sib were
heterozygous for the complex allele. The 19-month-old girl developed N.
meningitis and died in refractory shock about 47 hours after hospital
admission. Four years later, the 13-month-old brother was admitted to
the same hospital because of sudden onset of fever and a petechial rash.
At the age of 4 months, he had been hospitalized for a respiratory
syncytial virus infection complicated by bacterial superinfection. Blood
cultures grew N. meningitidis. Immunologic studies indicated that factor
D was undetectable. Because of this deficiency, the boy was put on
antibiotic prophylaxis and was vaccinated for N. meningitidis.

;;PCDH-GAMMA-A2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules that
mediate neural cell-cell interactions. Protocadherins constitute a
subfamily of nonclassic cadherins. PCDHGA2 is a member of subfamily A of
the gamma cluster of protocadherin genes on 5q31. For specific
information on the PCDHG genes, see 604968.

CLONING

By PCR of a brain cDNA library, Wu and Maniatis (1999) cloned
full-length PCDHGA2.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2001) mapped the PCDHGA2 gene
to 5q31, between the PCDHGA1 gene (606288) and the PCDHGA3 (606290)
gene. They localized the mouse PCDHG genes to chromosome 18c.

606699	TITLE *606699 HELICASE WITH ZINC FINGER DOMAIN; HELZ
;;KIAA0054;;
HUMORF5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HELZ is a member of the superfamily I class of RNA helicases. RNA
helicases alter the conformation of RNA by unwinding double-stranded
regions, thereby altering the biologic activity of the RNA molecule and
regulating access to other proteins (Wagner et al., 1999).

CLONING

Nomura et al. (1994) isolated a full-length HELZ cDNA, which they termed
KIAA0054, from a human immature myeloid cell line cDNA library. The
deduced 1,942-amino acid protein contains an ATP/GTP-binding site motif
A (P-loop). Wagner et al. (1999) found that the protein contains several
motifs characteristic of members of the RNA helicase superfamily I,
including a putative purine nucleotide-binding site. By Northern blot
analysis, Nomura et al. (1994) demonstrated ubiquitous expression of
HELZ. Using the gene trapping method, Wagner et al. (1999) identified
the mouse homolog of HELZ and found widespread spatial and temporal
expression throughout murine embryonic development.

GENE FUNCTION

Based on the complex transcription pattern and widespread
spatial-temporal distribution of the mouse HELZ homolog, Wagner et al.
(1999) suggested that HELZ may play a role in RNA metabolism in multiple
tissues and organs within the developing embryo.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the HELZ
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP SHGC-10970).

612697	TITLE *612697 VAULT RNA 1-3; VTRNA1-3
;;HVG3;;
VAULT RNA COMPONENT 3; VAULTRC3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Vaults are large cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteins composed largely of MVP
(605088) and a nontranslated vault RNA component. By PCR of a human
genomic DNA library, Kickhoefer et al. (1998) cloned 3 vault RNA genes,
HVG1 (VTRNA1-1; 612695), HVG2 (VTRNA1-2; 612696), and HVG3 (VTRNA1-3).
Both HVG2 and HVG3 contain 86 bases and have an internal RNA polymerase
III (see 606007)-type promoter element and a typical polymerase III
termination signal. They both have an internal 10-base deletion compared
with HVG1.

Kickhoefer et al. (1999) found that only HVG1 was expressed in all human
cell lines examined. When expressed, HVG2 and HVG3 were often associated
with the supernatant fraction rather than microsomal pellets containing
vaults.

Nandy et al. (2009) described the structure of VTRNA1-3. The
89-nucleotide RNA forms an extended stem-loop structure with asymmetric
internal bulges. It contains characteristic internal polymerase III
A-box and B-box promoter elements and a downstream B2-box motif.

GENE FUNCTION

Kickhoefer et al. (1998) found that HVG1, but not HVG2 or HVG3,
associated with vaults in human cell lines.

Nandy et al. (2009) found that expression of VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2,
VTRNA1-3, and CBL3 (VTRNA2-1; 614938) was upregulated in cord blood
lymphocytes infected with Epstein-Barr virus. Upregulation was highest
for VTRNA1-1 (about 1,100-fold) and lowest for CBL3 (about 3-fold).

GENE STRUCTURE

Kickhoefer et al. (2003) determined that the upstream region of the
VTRNA1-3 gene contains a TATA-like element, a consensus proximal
sequence, and a cAMP response element.

MAPPING

Kickhoefer et al. (2003) stated that the VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2, and
VTRNA1-3 genes map to a 16-kb region of chromosome 5.

Nandy et al. (2009) stated that the VTRNA1-3 gene is located near the
PCDHA gene cluster (604966), which Wu and Maniatis (1999) mapped to
chromosome 5q31.

606741	TITLE *606741 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 181; ZNF181
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc finger proteins have been shown to interact with nucleic acids and
to have diverse functions. The zinc finger domain is a conserved amino
acid sequence motif containing 2 specifically positioned cysteines and 2
histidines that are involved in coordinating zinc. Kruppel-related
proteins form 1 family of zinc finger proteins. See 604749 for
additional information on zinc finger proteins.

CLONING

By screening a human fetal heart cDNA library with a degenerate
oligonucleotide based on the consensus sequence of the C2H2 zinc finger
domain, Wang et al. (1996) cloned 2 novel zinc finger cDNAs, designated
ZNF180 (606740) and ZNF181.

MAPPING

By FISH, Wang et al. (1996) mapped the ZNF180 and ZNF181 genes within a
cluster of zinc finger genes on chromosome 19q13.2.

;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 11; LEP11
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE2C,
which they called LEP11. RT-PCR detected high LEP11 expression in skin
and esophagus, but not in heart.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) detected low LCE2C expression
in human fetal, arm, penal, and abdominal skin, and little to no
expression in vulva, tongue, and esophagus.

GENE FUNCTION

Jackson et al. (2005) showed that expression of LCE2 genes, including
LCE2C, was upregulated in cultured normal human keratinocytes by both
ultraviolet irradiation and calcium.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that the LCE2C gene contains 2 exons.
Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE2C
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) stated that the mouse Lce2c gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene
cluster on chromosome 3F1.

137167	TITLE *137167 GAMMA-GLUTAMYL CARBOXYLASE; GGCX
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Gamma-glutamyl carboxylase accomplishes the posttranslational
modification required for the activity of all of the vitamin K-dependent
proteins (Wu et al., 1991). These include some of the blood coagulation
and anticoagulation proteins as well as bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid
(Gla) protein (BGLAP; 112260) and bone matrix protein (MGP; 154870).

CLONING

Wu et al. (1991) cloned a cDNA corresponding to GGCX and showed that
expression resulted in an increase in carboxylase activity in microsomes
of transfected cells. The GGCX gene encodes a 758-residue integral
membrane protein with 3 transmembrane domains near its amino terminus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wu et al. (1997) found that the GGCX gene spans about 13 kb and contains
about 15 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Vitamin K is a necessary cofactor for the hepatic carboxylation of
glutamic acid residues in a number of proteins, including the
procoagulants factors II, VII, IX, and X; the anticoagulants protein C
and protein S; and other proteins such as osteocalcin and matrix Gla
protein (Brenner et al., 1990). This carboxylation is required for
normal hemostasis, because it enables calcium binding and attachment of
the procoagulants and anticoagulants to phospholipids. Gamma-glutamyl
carboxylase is an integral membrane microsomal enzyme located in the
rough endoplasmic reticulum. It carboxylates glutamate residues located
in the Gla domain of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. The
carboxylation reaction is dependent on reduced vitamin K, which is
converted to vitamin K epoxide during carboxylation, and must be
regenerated by the vitamin K epoxide reductase (EPHX1; 132810) for
carboxylation to continue.

MAPPING

Kuo et al. (1995) mapped the GGCX gene to chromosome 2 using
human/rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs and localized it to 2p12 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Combined Deficiency of Vitamin K-Dependent Clotting Factors-1

Brenner et al. (1990) described an offspring of a consanguineous
marriage with hereditary combined deficiency of vitamin K-dependent
procoagulants (VKCFD1; 277450). Epoxide reductase function was found to
be normal. Impairment of Gla-dependent calcium reduction binding was
suggested by cross-immunoelectrophoresis studies of prothrombin. They
therefore suggested that the abnormality in the kindred resulted from
GGCX deficiency, with autosomal recessive inheritance. Brenner et al.
(1998) identified a homozygous T-to-G transversion at codon 394 of the
GGCX gene that resulted in substitution of arginine for leucine (R394L;
137167.0001). The mutation was identified in all 4 children with
clinical and analytical findings of hereditary deficiency of all vitamin
K-dependent coagulation factors. This was the first reported mutation in
the GGCX gene.

Rost et al. (2004) reported what they stated to be the third case of
hereditary combined deficiency of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation
factors (VKCFD1) caused by mutation in the GGCX gene
(137167.0003-137167.0004).

- PXE-like Disorder with Multiple Coagulation Factor Deficiency

Vanakker et al. (2007) described a pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like
phenotype with associated multiple coagulation factor deficiency
(610842). They found mutations in the GGCX gene in 6 of 7 patients with
this phenotype and compared the findings in these 6 patients with the 4
previously described in the literature. None of the patients had
mutations in the ABCC6 gene (603234), which is the site of mutations in
pseudoxanthoma elasticum (264800), and none had mutations in the VKORC1
gene (608547), which is the site of mutations causing type 2 combined
deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (607473). Marked
laxity of skin which extended over the trunk was a feature in these
patients. Changes in the eye consisted of limited angioid streaks or
peau d'orange with no progression and no impairment of vision. Elastic
fibers in the dermis showed fragmentation and calcification as in PXE,
although by electron microscopy it was suggested that the changes could
be differentiated from those of PXE. Mutation analysis indicated that
PXE-like disorder with multiple coagulation factor deficiency is
inherited as a recessive. Vanakker et al. (2007) found homozygosity for
a missense mutation in 1 case (137167.0007), and compound heterozygosity
in 3 other cases (e.g., 137167.0005). In 2 other cases, only 1 mutant
allele was characterized (137167.0010, 137167.0011).

In 2 sisters with PXE-like disorder and multiple coagulation factor
deficiency, Li et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for the
V255M (137167.0012) and S300F (137167.0013) mutations in the GGCX gene.
Skin biopsies from the patients showed undercarboxylated matrix gla
proteins (MGP; 154870) in the areas of abnormal mineralization. The
family was unusual in that the sisters' mother and maternal aunt had
PXE-like skin changes, but no coagulopathy. Genetic analysis showed
compound heterozygosity for the V255M mutation and a common mutation in
the ABCC6 gene (R1141X; 603234.0001), which can cause classic PXE
(264800) when present with another ABCC6 mutation, but not in isolation.
The findings suggested that the mother and aunt had digenic inheritance
of PXE. In contrast, the unaffected father and brother, who were
compound heterozygous for S300F and the ABCC6 R1141X mutation had no
signs of either disorder. However, plasma levels of total
undercarboxylated MGP in the father and son were at the lower end of
normal. Although the reasons for the lack of clinical findings in the
father and son remained unclear, Li et al. (2009) concluded that
undercarboxylation of MGP plays a critical role in aberrant
mineralization of tissues in PXE.

ANIMAL MODEL

Congenital deficiency of all vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation
factors due to a defective vitamin K-dependent carboxylase was studied
in Devon Rex cats by Soute et al. (1992).

Zhu et al. (2007) found that Ggcx +/-mice developed normally, exhibited
normal survival and fertility, and showed normal plasma levels of
vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors and prothrombin. However, only
50% of Ggcx -/- offspring survived to term, and those that were born
succumbed to massive intraabdominal hemorrhage shortly after birth.

GGCX, LEU394ARG

Brenner et al. (1998) described a homozygous leu394-to-arg (L394R)
missense mutation in exon 9 of the GGCX gene in all 4 affected members
of an inbred kindred with deficiency of vitamin K-dependent blood
coagulation factors (277450). The first case, reported by Brenner et al.
(1990), was presented shortly after birth with multiple ecchymoses and
bleeding from puncture sites. An older sib had died at birth from
uncontrollable umbilical bleeding. The second patient presented at 5
months of age with knee hemarthrosis. The third and fourth affected
members were examined shortly after birth and were found to have
deficiency of all vitamin K-dependent procoagulants and anticoagulants.
Thus, chronic weekly administration of vitamin K resulted in a stable
increase of procoagulant and anticoagulant levels and successfully
prevented bleeding during a follow-up period of 30 patient years.

By Western blot analysis, Mutucumarana et al. (2000) showed that both
wildtype and L394R are expressed as 95-kD proteins. They found that the
variant appears to have a defect in its glutamate-binding site. In
addition, they identified a striking defect in the catalytic efficiency
of the carboxylase towards a phe-leu-glu-glu-leu (FLEEL) substrate.

GGCX, TRP501SER

Spronk et al. (2000) described a Lebanese boy, with consanguineous
parents, who suffered from combined congenital deficiency of all vitamin
K-dependent coagulation factors (277450). He was found to be homozygous
for a point mutation in exon 11 of the gamma-glutamyl carboxylase gene,
converting codon 501 from TGG to TCG and resulting in a trp501-to-ser
(W501S) mutation. Oral vitamin K1 administration resulted in resolution
of the clinical symptoms. Ten asymptomatic relatives were heterozygous
for the mutation.

In a patient with combined deficiency of all vitamin K-dependent blood
coagulation factors (277450), Rost et al. (2004) identified compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the GGCX gene: a G-to-C transversion in
exon 11, resulting in an arg485-to-pro (R485P) substitution, and a
G-to-T transversion in the 3-prime splice site of intron 2, resulting in
loss of exon 3 (137167.0004).

In a patient reported by Le Corvaisier-Pieto et al. (1996) with a
PXE-like disorder with multiple coagulation factor deficiency (610842),
Vanakker et al. (2007) found compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in
the GGCX gene: 924T-C (phe299 to ser; F299S) in exon 8 and 1700G-A
(gly558 to arg; G558R) in exon 12. The patient was a male, aged 40, with
onset of skin symptoms at age 16, generalized skin folds with laxity,
and positive calcium staining of elastic fibers.

In a 46-year-old woman with a PXE-like disorder with multiple
coagulation factor deficiency (610842), Vanakker et al. (2007)
identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in exon 12 of the GGCX
gene, a 1506G-C transversion that resulted in a trp493 to ser (W493S)
amino acid substitution. The patient had onset of skin symptoms at age
18 years and showed generalized skin folds with laxity. Limited angioid
streaks with no visual defect were present in the eyes. Calcium stain
was positive and deficiency of multiple vitamin K-dependent coagulation
factors was present. Cerebral aneurysms discovered at ages 36 and 46
years were successfully treated.

In a 46-year-old woman and 44-year-old man with PXE-like disorder with
multiple coagulation factor deficiency (610842), Vanakker et al. (2007)
found compound heterozygosity for the same 2 mutations in the GGCX gene:
1149C-T in exon 8 (gln374 to ter; Q374X) and 1339G-T in exon 12 (gly537

In a 67-year-old woman with PXE-like disorder with multiple coagulation
factor deficiency (610842), Vanakker et al. (2007) found a missense
mutation in exon 10 of the GGCX gene, a 1454C-T transition that resulted
in an arg476-to-cys substitution (R476). No mutation was identified on
the other allele.

In a 32-year-old woman with PXE-like disorder with multiple coagulation

mutation in exon 10 of the GGCX gene, a 1455G-A transition that resulted
in an arg476-to-his amino acid substitution (R476H). No mutation was
identified on the other allele.

.0012
PXE-LIKE DISORDER WITH MULTIPLE COAGULATION FACTOR DEFICIENCY
GGCX, VAL255MET

In 2 sisters with PXE-like disorder and multiple coagulation factor
deficiency (610842), Li et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity
for a 791G-A transition in exon 7 of the GGCX gene, resulting in a
val255-to-met (V255M) substitution, and a 927C-T transition in exon 8 of
the GGCX gene, resulting in a ser300-to-phe (S300F; 137167.0013)
substitution. Neither mutation was identified in 100 control alleles.
Val255 was highly conserved, whereas ser300 was less well conserved. The
sisters showed milder coagulation factor defects than previously
reported patients, suggesting some residual GGCX activity. In vitro
functional expression studies using a small peptide showed that the
V255M mutant had about 5% residual GGCX activity and the S300F variant
had essentially no activity. However, when present with a factor X
propeptide, the V255M mutant showed GGCX activity similar to wildtype,
whereas the S300F mutant activity remained low at 3% of wildtype. Skin
biopsies from the patients showed undercarboxylated matrix gla proteins
(MGP; 154870) in the areas of abnormal mineralization. The family was
unusual in that the sisters' mother and maternal aunt had mild PXE-like
skin changes, but no coagulopathy. Skin biopsies in the mother and aunt
showed undercarboxylated MGP in the areas of abnormal mineralization.
Genetic analysis showed compound heterozygosity for the V255M mutation
and a common mutation in the ABCC6 gene (R1141X; 603234.0001), which can
cause classic PXE (264800) when present with another ABCC6 mutation, but
not in isolation. The findings suggested that the mother and aunt had
digenic inheritance of a 'forme fruste' of PXE (177850). In contrast,
the unaffected father and brother, who were compound heterozygous for
the S300F mutation and the ABCC6 R1141X mutation had no signs of either
disorder on clinical exam but refused to participate in further clinical
testing. Plasma levels of total undercarboxylated MGP in the father and
son were at the lower end of normal. Although the reasons for the lack
of clinical findings in the father and son remained unclear, Li et al.
(2009) concluded that undercarboxylation of MGP plays a critical role in
aberrant mineralization of tissues in PXE.

604720	TITLE *604720 TRANSFERRIN RECEPTOR 2; TFR2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

While attempting to isolate genes encoding new transcriptional factors
from a TF-1 (erythroid leukemia) cell cDNA library, Kawabata et al.
(1999) cloned an 831-bp human cDNA fragment that had significant amino
acid homology to the middle portion of the classic transferrin receptor
protein (TFRC; 190010). Using 5-prime/3-prime RACE, they cloned a
full-length, 2.9-kb cDNA, which they designated TFR2. They identified 2
transcripts: a 2.9-kb transcript, called alpha, and an approximately
2.5-kb transcript, called beta, which was cloned from an HL60 (myeloid
leukemia) cell cDNA library. The alpha form predicts an 801-amino acid
type II membrane protein that shares 45% identity and 66% similarity in
its extracellular domain with TFRC. The beta form, which may be an
alternative product of splicing or promoter usage, lacks the
amino-terminal portion of TFR2-alpha, including the putative
transmembrane domain. Northern blot analysis showed that the alpha form
is predominantly expressed in the liver and also in the K562
erythromegakaryocytic cell line; no expression of the beta form was
found. By RT-PCR analysis, TFR2-alpha was expressed in the liver,
spleen, lung, muscle, prostate, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells,
whereas expression of TFR-beta was found in all tissues tested.
Expression of human TFR2 conferred binding of holotransferrin and uptake
of transferrin-bound iron to a Chinese hamster ovary cell line lacking
endogenous TFRC. Kawabata et al. (1999) concluded that TFR2-alpha may be
a second transferrin receptor that can mediate cellular iron transport.

GENE FUNCTION

The majority of hepatic iron uptake under normal circumstances is
transferrin-mediated. However, expression of TFRC in hepatocytes, as in
other nonreticuloendothelial cell types, is downregulated in response to
increased intracellular iron. As a consequence, TFRC expression in liver
is undetectable in hereditary hemochromatosis (235200) patients with
hepatic iron loading. Nonetheless, hepatic iron loading in
hemochromatosis patients is progressive. Fleming et al. (2000) provided
support for a mechanism that involves the uptake of transferrin-bound
iron by TFR2. By screening a murine EST database for Tfrc sequences,
they identified a cDNA encoding a protein homologous to murine Tfrc.
They characterized the murine TFR2 ortholog and compared expression of
murine Tfrc and Tfr2 in normal mice, mice with iron deficiency, and mice
with iron overload. Unlike Tfrc, the Tfr2 transcript was highly
expressed in hepatocytes, was not regulated by tissue iron status, and
was not downregulated in a murine model of hereditary hemochromatosis.
From these observations, Fleming et al. (2000) proposed that TFR2
continues to mediate uptake of transferrin-bound iron by the liver after
TFRC is downregulated by iron overload, and thus may explain increased
susceptibility of the liver to iron loading in hereditary
hemochromatosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kawabata et al. (1999) determined the genomic structure of the TFR2
gene. The alpha transcript contains 18 exons. The beta transcript lacks
exons 1 through 3 and has an additional 142 bases at the 5-prime end of
exon 4.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Kawabata et al. (1999) mapped the TFR2
gene to chromosome 7q22.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Camaschella et al. (2000) identified a premature termination mutation at
codon 250 in the TFR2 gene in homozygosity in a Sicilian family
segregating hemochromatosis type 3 (HFE3; 604250). The Y250X mutation
(604720.0001) identified by Camaschella et al. (2000) is located in a
region shared by both the alpha and beta transcripts of TFR2. A
phenotype of iron overload associated with the absence of the functional
gene suggested TFR2 is more likely involved in iron regulation rather
than iron uptake. Although TFR2 is highly expressed in an erythroid cell
line, none of the HFE3 patients that they studied showed erythrocyte
abnormalities. Rather, the patients tolerated long-term phlebotomies
without developing anemia. Thus, Camaschella et al. (2000) concluded
that TFR2, in contrast to TFRC, is not essential during erythroid
maturation.

Feder et al. (1996) found that about 15% of heriditary hemochromatosis
patients of northern European descent do not carry the C282Y mutation of
the HFE gene (613609.0001). Mattman et al. (2002) studied a group of
non-C282Y hemochromatosis patients and identified several sequence
variants, including a homozygous missense mutation in exon 17 of the
TFR2 gene, which resulted in a gln690-to-pro amino acid change
(604720.0005).

Hofmann et al. (2002) performed mutation analysis of the TFR2 gene in
patients with atypical hemochromatosis. They also questioned whether
differences in penetrance of the HFE C282Y mutation (613609.0001) were
associated with mutations in the TFR2 gene. They studied sib pairs
homozygous for cys282-to-tyr with a discordant phenotype. The most
common discordance between homozygous sibs was in serum transferrin
concentration. Many of these patients, however, also exhibited
significant differences in liver fibrosis and liver enzyme levels. They
also studied individuals who were not homozygous for C282Y with evidence
of iron excess, and other atypical groups. In a pair of brothers
homozygous for the C282Y mutation, they found an arg455-to-gln mutation
in TFR2 (604720.0004) only in the brother with liver fibrosis,
suggesting that TFR2 functions as a modifier for penetrance of the
hemochromatosis phenotype when present with homozygosity for C282Y.
Unlike TFR1 expression, TFR2 expression is not downregulated in the
liver of iron-loaded mice (Fleming et al., 2000). The screening for
mutations in all 18 exons indicated that mutations of the TFR2 gene are
rare.

ANIMAL MODEL

To characterize the role of TFR2 in iron homeostasis, Fleming et al.
(2002) generated a premature stop codon (Y245X), which was introduced by
targeted mutagenesis in the murine Tfr2 coding sequence. Codon 245 is
the mouse ortholog of codon 250, which is involved in the C250Y mutation
(604720.0001) of TFR2 in human hemochromatosis, and is located in a
region that is conserved between the mouse and human genomes. Fleming et
al. (2002) observed that by 4 weeks of age, mice homozygous for the
Y245X mutation developed periportal hepatic iron loading, splenic iron
sparing, and elevated serum transferrin saturations. Thus, the mutant
mice seemed to provide a faithful model for the abnormalities in iron
homeostasis observed in patients with loss of TFR2. Heterozygous mice
did not differ in any measured parameter from wildtype mice.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 3
TFR2, TYR250TER

In 2 families from Sicily who met diagnostic criteria for
hemochromatosis (604250) but were not linked to HFE, one of which was
consanguineous, Camaschella et al. (2000) identified a C-to-G
transversion in exon 6 at position 750 of the TFR2 cDNA sequence,
resulting in a tyrosine (TAC)-to-stop (TAG) substitution at residue 250
(Y250X). This substitution created a MaeI site. All affected members of
the consanguineous family were homozygous for Y250X, whereas obligate
carriers were heterozygous. One patient in the nonconsanguineous family
was homozygous for this mutation. Camaschella et al. (2000) did not find
the Y250X mutation in 100 normal chromosomes or in 12 hemochromatosis
patients who did not have mutations in HFE.

.0002
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 3
TFR2, 1-BP INS, 84C

In all affected members of a large inbred family in Campania in southern
Italy segregating hemochromatosis (604250), Roetto et al. (2001) found a
1-bp insertion of a cytosine residue in homozygous state in exon 2 in a
polyC tract (84-88 insC). The mutation resulted in a frameshift followed
by a premature stop codon, a glu60-to-ter (E60X) substitution. Because
of consanguinity, a pseudodominant pedigree pattern was observed in an
affected father and his 3 affected children in one branch of the family.
Heterozygosity was not associated with iron overload, even in
individuals also heterozygous for H63D (613609.0002) at the HFE locus or
for the beta-thalassemia trait.

.0003
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 3
TFR2, MET172LYS

In a family in which the proband had severe hemochromatosis (604250),
Roetto et al. (2001) found homozygosity for a T-to-A transversion
(515T-A) in exon 4 of TFR2 cDNA, resulting in a met172-to-lys (M172K)
substitution of the protein. The proband had cirrhosis, hypogonadism,
and cardiac disease. He had inherited beta-thalassemia in heterozygous
state from his mother.

.0004
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 1, MODIFIER OF
TFR2, ARG455GLN

Hofmann et al. (2002) studied 2 brothers who were homozygous for the
common hemochromatosis-causing mutation of the HFE gene, cys282 to tyr
(613609.0001). Direct nucleotide sequencing found a G-to-A transversion
at nucleotide 1391, resulting in an arg455-to-gln (R455Q) amino acid
change in the TFR2 gene. The R455Q mutation was present in only 1 of the
brothers homozygous for C282Y; that brother had evidence of liver
fibrosis, whereas the other brother did not.

.0005
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 3
TFR2, GLN690PRO

In a Portuguese man with severe hemochromatosis (604250) and in 2 family
members, Mattman et al. (2002) found a gln690-to-pro (Q690P) mutation in
the TFR2 gene. The patient presented at 29 years of age with fatigue,
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, hyperpigmentation, mild elevation of
liver transaminases, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. He had
markedly elevated serum iron indices and had had more than 12 g of iron
removed via phlebotomy in the previous 4 years. Additional hematologic
abnormalities included mild normocytic anemia and lymphopenia. He was
heterozygous for the H63D mutation in the HFE gene (613609.0002).
Mattman et al. (2002) stated that this patient was the only one of 89
non-C282Y hereditary chromatosis patients of predominately mixed
European descent in whom mutation of the TFR2 gene had been found.

611059	TITLE *611059 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 82; WDR82
;;TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 113; TMEM113
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

WDR82 is a regulatory component of the mammalian SET1A (611052) and
SET1B (611055) histone H3 (see 602810) lys4 methyltransferase complexes
(Lee and Skalnik, 2005; Lee et al., 2007). WDR82 additionally associates
with multiple protein complexes, including a chaperonin-containing TCP1
(186980) complex and a protein phosphatase-1 (PP1; see 176875) complex
(Lee et al., 2010).

CLONING

In their Figure 3, Lee et al. (2010) showed that the WDR82 protein
contains 7 WD40 domains distributed throughout the molecule.

GENE FUNCTION

By mass spectrometric analysis of nuclear proteins that
immunoprecipitated with WDR82 from HEK293 cell nuclear extracts, Lee et
al. (2010) identified WDR82 as a component of several protein complexes,
including 4 distinct histone H3 lys4 methyltransferase complexes, a
chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex, and a PP1 complex. They
characterized the PP1 complex further and found that it contained PNUTS
(PPP1R10; 603771), TOX4 (614032), WDR82, and any 1 of the 3 catalytic
subunits of PP1, PP1-alpha (PPP1CA; 176875), PP1-beta (PPP1CB; 600590),
or PP1-gamma (PPP1CC; 176914). The complex, which they called PTW/PP1,
had an apparent molecular mass of about 200 kD, suggesting that it
contains 1 molecule of each subunit. Mutation analysis revealed that
human WDR82 interacted with a central domain of mouse Pnuts. WDR82 did
not interact directly with any other human PTW/PP1 subunit. The PTW/PP1
complex efficiently dephosphorylated the isolated C-terminal domain of
the large subunit of mouse RNA polymerase II (POLR2A; 180660) in vitro.
The PTW/PP1 complex was stable throughout the cell cycle in HEK293
cells, but its association with chromatin was regulated. PTW/PP1
associated with chromatin during interphase, was excluded from condensed
chromosomes during early mitosis, and was reloaded onto chromosomes at
late telophase.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TMEM113
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP SHGC-77002). Scott (2007) mapped the TMEM113
gene to chromosome 3p21.1 based on an alignment of the TMEM113 sequence
(GenBank GENBANK AC092045) with the genomic sequence (build 36.2).

615263	TITLE *615263 FAMILY WITH SEQUENCE SIMILARITY 86, MEMBER A; FAM86A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from a donor,
generally S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), to acceptor molecules,
including proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids, and small metabolites. FAM86A
belongs to a family of protein lysine methyltransferases that methylate
nonhistone proteins (Cloutier et al., 2013).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to METTL22 (615261),
Cloutier et al. (2013) identified FAM86A. The deduced protein is made up
predominantly of a Rossmann fold of alternating beta strands and alpha
helices, with a conserved AdoMet-binding site near the N terminus.
Epitope-tagged FAM86A was predominantly expressed in a diffuse
cytoplasmic distribution in transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By affinity purification, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry, Cloutier et
al. (2013) found that FAM86A expressed in HEK293 cells interacted with
FAM86B and FAM86C.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the FAM86A gene to chromosome 16p13.3 based on an
alignment of the FAM86A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY037162) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

134690	TITLE *134690 FAU GENE; FAU
;;FBR-MuSV ASSOCIATED UBIQUITOUSLY EXPRESSED GENE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The FAU gene is the cellular homolog of the fox sequence in the
Finkel-Biskis-Reilly murine sarcoma virus (FBR-MuSV) (summary by Kas et
al., 1992).

CLONING

Kas et al. (1992) cloned and sequenced the human FAU gene. Its name is
derived from 'FBR-MuSV associated ubiquitously expressed gene.' FAU
encodes a fusion protein consisting of 133 amino acids. The 59 amino
acids at the carboxy terminus encode the ribosomal protein S30, part of
the small ribosomal subunit. The amino-terminal part of FAU (74 amino
acids) shows strong homology to ubiquitin, a 76-amino acid
multifunctional cellular protein.

MAPPING

Kas et al. (1993) used a cosmid clone containing the human FAU gene for
fluorescence in situ hybridization to localize the gene to 11q13. The
localization was confirmed by hybridization against a panel of somatic
cell hybrids containing different parts of chromosome 11 on a hamster
background. FAU was then further mapped, both on a panel of
radiation-reduced somatic cell hybrids designed to carry different parts
of the 11q13 region and by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. This fine
mapping placed FAU close to the PYGM gene (608455) in a region that
contains oncogenes as well as the putative tumor suppressor genes MEN1
(613733) and ST3 (191181).

By linkage mapping, Casteels et al. (1995) assigned the Fau gene to
mouse chromosome 19.

Courseaux et al. (1996) used a combination of methods to refine maps of
the approximately 5-Mb region of 11q13 that includes MEN1 (613733). They
proposed the following gene order:
cen--PGA--FTH1--UGB--AHNAK--ROM1--MDU1--CHRM1--COX8--EMK1--FKBP2--PLCB3--[PYGM,
ZFM1]--FAU--CAPN1--[MLK3, RELA]--FOSL1--SEA--CFL1--tel.

OTHER FEATURES

Kapranov et al. (2010) demonstrated that human cells contain a novel
type of short RNA (sRNA) with a nongenomically encoded 5-prime poly(U)
tail. They proposed that the presence of these RNAs at the termini of
genes, specifically at the very 3-prime ends of known mRNAs, such as
that for FAU, strongly argues for the presence of a yet uncharacterized
endogenous biochemical pathway in cells that can copy RNA. Kapranov et
al. (2010) showed that this pathway can operate on multiple genes, with
specific enrichment toward transcript-encoding components of the
translational machinery. They also showed that genes are also flanked by
sense, 3-prime polyadenylated sRNAs that are likely to be capped.

613503	TITLE *613503 MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX, CLASS II, DQ ALPHA-2; HLA-DQA2
;;MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX, CLASS II, DX ALPHA; HLA-DXA;;
DX-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HLA class II molecules are heterodimers encoded by alpha and beta genes
located in 3 subregions of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).
HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 (615161) are 1 of 2 pairs of genes in the HLA-DQ
subregion of the MHC. HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 are well conserved and,
unlike most HLA class II genes, exhibit little or no polymorphism
(Berdoz et al., 1989). HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 appear to be specifically
expressed in Langerhans cells (Lenormand et al., 2012).

CLONING

Using various methods, Berdoz et al. (1989) detected only low-level
polymorphism in the HLA-DQA2 gene that was restricted to noncoding
regions.

Rudy and Lew (1997) stated that HLA-DQA2 differs from HLA-DQA1 (146880)
only at the penultimate amino acid, where HLA-DQA2 has leu231 and
HLA-DQA1 has pro231. By Western blot analysis of B-lymphoblastoid cell
lines, Rudy and Lew (1997) detected variable expression of HLA-DQA2 in
all MHC class II haplotypes examined. HLA-DQA2 expression was
consistently 3-fold less than that of HLA-DQA1. Immunoprecipitation
analysis showed expression of HLA-DQA2 on the cell surface.

Using RT-PCR, Lenormand et al. (2012) cloned 2 HLA-DQA2 variants from
human Langerhans cell RNA. One variant was full length, with the
potential to encode a transmembrane HLA alpha chain. The other variant
lacked exon 4, which encodes the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains,
and thus had the potential to encode a soluble protein. Additional
RT-PCR experiments confirmed that HLA-DQA2 was specifically expressed in
epidermal Langerhans cells, and not in monocyte-derived dendritic cells,
blood CD1C (188340)-positive dendritic cells, or plasmacytoid dendritic
cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis of B-lymphoblastoid cells, Rudy and Lew
(1997) found that, despite its expression at the cell surface, HLA-DQA2
did not dimerize with HLA-DQB1 (604305) or with any other MHC class II
beta chain examined. Furthermore, HLA-DQA2 did not dimerize with a
selected HLA-DQB1 chain in a transfection system. Rudy and Lew (1997)
found no evidence for expression of an HLA-DQB2 beta chain. HLA-DQA2
did, however, coprecipitate with the invariant chain, Ii (CD74; 142790),
from a B-lymphoblastoid cell lysate.

Using immunoprecipitation, Western blot, and immunofluorescence
analyses, Lenormand et al. (2012) found that human HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2
formed heterodimers that required association with the invariant chain
for transport to early endosomes. Flow cytometry showed that
HLA-DQA2/HLA-DQB2 heterodimers were expressed at the cell surface and
mediated staphylococcal superantigen stimulation of T cells. Lenormand
et al. (2012) proposed that the poorly polymorphic and well-conserved
HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 genes are of immunologic importance and may
influence the complexity of the repertoire of antigens presented by
Langerhans cells.

MAPPING

Rudy and Lew (1997) stated that HLA-DQA2 is the more centromeric of the
2 HLA-DQA genes within the MHC class II complex on chromosome 6p21.3.

139313	TITLE *139313 GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING PROTEIN, ALPHA-11; GNA11
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Strathmann and Simon (1991) described the Gna11 gene in the mouse. The
human gene was cloned by Jiang et al. (1991) and found to be 359 amino
acids long. Mouse Gna11 and Gna15 (139314) are tandemly duplicated in a
head-to-tail array. Davignon et al. (1996) showed that the upstream
gene, Gna11, is ubiquitously expressed, whereas expression of the
downstream gene, Gna15, is restricted to hematopoietic cells. There was
no evidence for alternative splicing within the coding sequence of
either gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mice lacking G-alpha subunits specifically in smooth muscle cells,
Wirth et al. (2008) found that G-alpha-q (GNAQ; 600998) and G-alpha-11
were required for maintenance of basal blood pressure and for
development of salt-induced hypertension. In contrast, lack of
G-alpha-12 (GNA12; 604394) and G-alpha-13 (GNA13; 604406) and their
effector, Larg (ARHGEF12; 604763), did not alter normal blood pressure
regulation, but blocked development of salt-induced hypertension.

GENE STRUCTURE

Strathmann and Simon (1991) found that mouse Gna11 and Gna15 (139314)
are tandemly duplicated in a head-to-tail array, spanning approximately
43 kb. Davignon et al., 1996 further studied the genomic structure of
mouse Gna11 and Gna15. Gna11 and Gna15 each contain 7 exons interposed
by 6 introns. Gna11 is upstream of Gna15, and the region separating the
2 genes is 6 kb long. Phylogenetic trees revealed an approximately
6-fold higher rate of change in Gna15 than in Gna11.

MAPPING

Wilkie et al. (1992) demonstrated that the GNA11 gene is located on
mouse chromosome 10 (by the study of RFLVs in an interspecific
backcross) and on human 19p13 (by in situ hybridization).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In the proband from a 4-generation kindred with hypocalciuric
hypercalcemia mapping to chromosome 19p13 (HHC2; 145981) and an
unrelated proband with HHC, Nesbit et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a 3-bp in-frame deletion and a missense mutation,
respectively (139313.0001-139313.0002). In addition, 2 unrelated
patients with hypocalcemia (HYPOC2; 615361) were found to be
heterozygous for missense mutations in GNA11 (139313.0003 and
139313.0004). All 4 GNA11 mutations predicted disrupted protein
structures, and functional analysis in HEK293 cells showed that family
hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type II-associated mutations decrease the
sensitivity of cells expressing calcium-sensing receptors to changes in
extracellular calcium concentrations, whereas autosomal dominant
hypocalcemia 2-associated mutations increase cell sensitivity.

In affected members of 2 unrelated 4-generation families segregating
autosomal dominant hypocalcemia, Mannstadt et al. (2013) identified
heterozygous missense mutations (139313.0005 and 139313.0006) that
segregated with disease in each family.

- Somatic Mutations

By gene sequencing of exon 5 of the GNA11 gene, Van Raamsdonk et al.
(2010) identified somatic mutations affecting residue Q209 in 7% of blue
nevi (603670), 32% of primary uveal melanomas (155720), and 57% of uveal
melanoma metastases. Mutations in the same codon (Q209) of the paralogue
gene GNAQ (600998) were found in 55% of blue nevi, 45% of primary uveal
melanomas, and 22% of uveal melanoma metastases. The sample group
included a total of 713 melanocytic neoplasms. Sequencing of exon 4 of
these genes, affecting residue R183, in 453 melanocytic neoplasms showed
a lower prevalence of mutations: 2.1% of blue nevi and 4.9% of primary
uveal melanomas. The mutations were mutually exclusive, except for a
single tumor that carried mutations at both Q209 and R183 in GNA11. In
total, 83% of all uveal melanomas examined had oncogenic mutations in
either GNAQ or GNA11. Mice injected with cells transduced with the GNA11
Q209L mutation developed rapidly growing tumors and metastases, whereas
injection with GNA11 R183C-transduced cells showed lesser potency.
Western blot analysis of melanocytes transduced with Q209L showed
constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. Although GNA11 mutations
appeared to have a more potent effect on melanocytes than did GNAQ
mutations, there was no difference in patient survival among those with
GNA11 mutations compared to those with GNAQ mutations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using gene targeting, Offermanns et al. (1998) generated Gna11-deficient
mice that were viable and fertile with no apparent behavioral or
morphologic defects. They bred Gnaq-deficient mice with Gna11-deficient
mice and observed gene dosage effects between Gnaq and Gna11. Embryos
completely lacking both genes died in utero with heart malformations.
Mice inheriting a single copy of either gene died within hours of birth
with craniofacial and/or cardiac defects. Offermanns et al. (1998)
concluded that at least 2 active alleles of these genes are required for
extrauterine life. Genetic, morphologic, and pharmacologic analyses of
intercross offspring inheriting different combinations of these 2
mutations indicated that Gnaq and Gna11 have overlapping functions in
embryonic cardiomyocyte proliferation and craniofacial development.

A new class of dominant 'dark skin' (Dsk) mutations was discovered in a
screen of approximately 30,000 mice in a large-scale mutagenesis study.
These result from increased dermal melanin. Van Raamsdonk et al. (2004)
identified 3 of 4 such mutations as hypermorphic alleles of Gnaq and
Gna11, which encode widely expressed G-alpha-q subunits, act in an
additive and quantitative manner, and require endothelin receptor, type
B (EDNRB; 131244). Interaction between Gq and Kit receptor tyrosine
kinase (164920) signaling can mediate coordinate or independent control
of skin and hair color. The results provided a mechanism that can
explain several aspects of human pigmentary variation and show how
polymorphism of essential proteins and signaling pathways can affect a
single physiologic system.

Kero et al. (2007) generated mice with thyrocyte-specific Gna11/Gnaq
deficiency and observed severely reduced iodine organification and
thyroid hormone secretion in response to TSH, with many of the mice
developing hypothyroidism within months after birth. In addition, these
mice lacked the normal proliferative thyroid response to TSH or
goitrogenic diet. Kero et al. (2007) concluded that the GNA11/GNAQ
pathway has an essential role in the adaptive growth of the thyroid
gland.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOCALCIURIC HYPERCALCEMIA, FAMILIAL, TYPE II
GNA11, 3-BP DEL, 598ATC

In affected members of a 4-generation family segregating autosomal
dominant hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (HHC2; 145981), originally studied
by Heath et al. (1992) (kindred 11675), Nesbit et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a 3-bp deletion (c.598_600delATC) in the GNA11 gene,
resulting in an in-frame deletion of the highly conserved ile200 residue
(ile200del). The mutation was not found in 55 controls or in 5,400
exomes from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. Functional analysis in
HEK293 cells stably expressing calcium-sensing receptors demonstrated
that the GNA11 ile200del mutant induces a decrease in sensitivity to
changes in extracellular calcium concentrations.

.0002
HYPOCALCIURIC HYPERCALCEMIA, FAMILIAL, TYPE II
GNA11, LEU135GLN

In a man who presented at 54 years of age with hypocalciuric
hypercalcemia (HHC2; 145981), Nesbit et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a c.404T-A transversion in the GNA11 gene, resulting
in a leu135-to-gln (L135Q) substitution at a highly conserved residue in
the helical domain. The mutation was not found in 55 controls or in
5,400 exomes from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. Functional
analysis in HEK293 cells stably expressing calcium-sensing receptors
demonstrated that the GNA11 L135Q mutant induces a decrease in
sensitivity to changes in extracellular calcium concentrations.

.0003
HYPOCALCEMIA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 2
GNA11, ARG181GLN

In a woman who was diagnosed at 52 years of age with hypocalcemia
(HYPOC2; 615361), Nesbit et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a
c.542G-A transition in the GNA11 gene, resulting in an arg181-to-gln
(R181Q) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the alpha-F helix
of the helical domain. The mutation was not found in 55 controls or in
5,400 exomes from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. Functional
analysis in HEK293 cells stably expressing calcium-sensing receptors
demonstrated that the GNA11 R181Q mutant induces an increase in
sensitivity to changes in extracellular calcium concentrations. The
patient was asymptomatic, but was ascertained after another family
member was diagnosed with hypocalcemia.

.0004
HYPOCALCEMIA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 2
GNA11, PHE341LEU

In a woman who presented at 39 years of age with hypocalcemia (HYPOC2;
615361), Nesbit et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a c.1023C-G
transversion in the GNA11 gene, resulting in a phe341-to-leu (F341L)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the GTPase domain. The
mutation was not found in 55 controls or in 5,400 exomes from the NHLBI
Exome Sequencing Project. Functional analysis in HEK293 cells stably
expressing calcium-sensing receptors demonstrated that the GNA11 F341L
mutant induces an increase in sensitivity to changes in extracellular
calcium concentrations. The patient reported a 10-year history of
occasional paresthesias, muscle cramps, and carpopedal spasm.

In 6 affected members of a 4-generation family segregating autosomal
dominant hypocalcemia (HYPOC2; 615361), Mannstadt et al. (2013)
identified heterozygosity for a c.178C-T transition in exon 2 of the
GNA11 gene, resulting in an arg60-to-cys (R60C) substitution at a highly
conserved residue. The mutation was not found in unaffected family
members.

GNA11, SER211TRP

In 9 affected members of a 4-generation family segregating autosomal
dominant hypocalcemia (HYPOC2; 615361), Mannstadt et al. (2013)
identified heterozygosity for a c.632C-G transversion in exon 5 of the
GNA11 gene, resulting in a ser211-to-trp (S211W) substitution at a
highly conserved residue. The mutation was not found in unaffected
family members.

185880	TITLE *185880 VESICLE-ASSOCIATED MEMBRANE PROTEIN 1; VAMP1
;;SYNAPTOBREVIN 1; SYB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Synaptobrevins 1 and 2 (185881) are small integral membrane proteins
specific for synaptic vesicles in neurons.

CLONING

Archer et al. (1990) isolated and characterized cosmid clones containing
the human genes encoding synaptobrevins 1 and 2. Their coding regions
are highly homologous, being interrupted at identical positions by
introns of different size and sequence.

GENE STRUCTURE

The genes encoding synaptobrevins 1 and 2 have 5 exons whose boundaries
correspond to those of the protein domains (Archer et al., 1990). Exon 1
contains part of the initiator methionine codon, whereas exon 2 encodes
the variable and immunogenic amino-terminal domain. The third exon
comprises the highly conserved central domain, exon 4 encodes most of
the transmembrane region, and exon 5 contains the last residues of the
transmembrane region and the small intravesicular carboxyl terminus.

GENE FUNCTION

Neuronal exocytosis is triggered by calcium and requires 3 SNARE
proteins: synaptobrevin on the synaptic vesicle, and syntaxin (e.g.,
186590) and SNAP25 (600322) on the plasma membrane. Neuronal SNARE
proteins form a parallel 4-helix bundle that is thought to drive the
fusion of opposing membranes. Hu et al. (2002) demonstrated that whereas
syntaxin and SNAP25 in target membranes are freely available for SNARE
complex formation, availability of synaptobrevin on synaptic vesicles is
very limited. Calcium at micromolar concentrations triggers SNARE
complex formation and fusion between synaptic vesicles and reconstituted
target membranes. Although calcium does promote interaction of SNARE
proteins between opposing membranes, it does not act by releasing
synaptobrevin from synaptic vesicle restriction. Hu et al. (2002)
concluded that their data suggests a mechanism in which
calcium-triggered membrane apposition enables syntaxin and SNAP25 to
engage synaptobrevin, leading to membrane fusion.

Tucker et al. (2004) investigated the effect of synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1;
185605) on membrane fusion mediated by neuronal SNARE proteins SNAP25,
syntaxin, and synaptobrevin, which were reconstituted into vesicles. In
the presence of calcium, the cytoplasmic domain of SYT1 strongly
stimulated membrane fusion when synaptobrevin densities were similar to
those found in native synaptic vesicles. The calcium dependence of
SYT1-stimulated fusion was modulated by changes in lipid composition of
the vesicles and by a truncation that mimics cleavage of SNAP25 by
botulinum neurotoxin A. Stimulation of fusion was abolished by
disrupting the calcium-binding activity, or by severing the tandem C2
domains, of SYT1. Thus, SYT1 and SNAREs are likely to represent the
minimal protein complement for calcium-triggered exocytosis.

By use of the large calyx of Held presynaptic terminal from rats, Sakaba
et al. (2005) demonstrated that cleavage of different SNARE proteins by
clostridial neurotoxins caused distinct kinetic changes in
neurotransmitter release. When elevating calcium ion concentration
directly at the presynaptic terminal with the use of caged calcium,
cleavage of SNAP25 by botulinum toxin A produced a strong reduction in
the calcium sensitivity for release, whereas cleavage of syntaxin using
botulinum toxin C1 and synaptobrevin using tetanus toxin produced an all
or nothing block without changing the kinetics of remaining vesicles.
When stimulating release by calcium influx through channels, a
difference between botulinum toxin C1 and tetanus toxin emerged, which
suggests that cleavage of synaptobrevin modifies the coupling between
channels and release-competent vesicles.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids, Archer et al.
(1990) assigned the SYB1 gene to 12p; by analysis of DNA from Chinese
hamster-mouse somatic cell hybrids, they mapped the Syb1 gene to mouse
chromosome 6.

ANIMAL MODEL

The 'lethal-wasting' (lew) mouse is a spontaneous autosomal recessive
mutant that manifests as a neurologic phenotype characterized by
generalized lack of movement, wasting and prewean death by age 15 days.
By positional cloning, Nystuen et al. (2007) determined that the lew
phenotype results from a 190G-T transversion in the coding region of the
Vamp1 gene, predicted to result in truncation of nearly half of the
protein. Western blot analysis showed no detectable Vamp1 protein in
mutant mice. The authors noted that the phenotype was milder than that
of Vamp2 (185881)-null mice, which die at birth. By immunostudies of
normal mice, Nystuen et al. (2007) showed that Vamp1 is expressed
primarily in certain neuronal tissues, including the retina and areas of
the diencephalon and midbrain such as the zona incerta (subthalamus) and
rostral periolivary region. The findings suggested that Vamp1 has a
vital role in a subset of central nervous system tissues.

611331	TITLE *611331 SMALL NUCLEOLAR RNA, H/ACA BOX, 74B; SNORA74B
;;snoRNA, U19-2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs involved in RNA
processing. Box H/ACA snoRNAs, such as SNORA74B, direct the conversion
of uridine to pseudouridine at specific residues of ribosomal RNAs or
small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (Gu et al., 2005).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of human blood total RNA, Gu et al. (2005) identified several
box H/ACA snoRNAs, including SNORA74B, which they called U19-2. U19-2
contains 204 nucleotides and has 3 isoforms.

GENE FUNCTION

Based on sequence complementarity, Gu et al. (2005) predicted that U19-2
directs pseudouridylation of U3731 and U3733 of 28S ribosomal RNA (see
180450).

MAPPING

Gu et al. (2005) mapped the SNORA74B gene to chromosome 5, within intron
3 of the ATP6V0E1 gene (603931).
