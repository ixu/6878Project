DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Micro RNAs (miRNAs), such as MIR191, are conserved small noncoding RNAs
that bind to complementary sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of target
mRNAs, inhibiting their translation and/or inducing their degradation
(Lena et al., 2012).

GENE FUNCTION

Using microarray analysis, Lena et al. (2012) found that MIR191 was
significantly upregulated in normal human neonatal epidermal
keratinocytes (HEKn) following development of senescence in culture.
Bioinformatic analysis and reporter gene assays revealed functional
MIR191 target sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of transcripts for the cell
cycle regulator CDK6 (603368) and the AT-rich binding protein SATB1
(602075). Western blot analysis confirmed that ectopic expression of
MIR191 in HEKn cells caused downregulation of SATB1 and CDK6,
concomitant with decreased cell proliferation and expression of
senescence markers.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the MIR191 gene to chromosome 3p21.31 based on an
alignment of the mature MIR191 sequence (CAACGGAAUCCCAAAAGCAGCUG) with
the genomic sequence (GRCh37).
