614757	TITLE *614757 INTERFERON-INDUCED TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 5; IFITM5
;;FRAGILIS 4, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lange et al. (2003) cloned mouse Ifitm5, which they called fragilis-4,
and they identified human IFITM5 by database analysis. The deduced human
protein contains 132 amino acids and is predicted to have 2
transmembrane domains. The mouse and human proteins share highest
conservation in a central region that includes the first transmembrane
domain and the beginning of the second transmembrane domain. This
central region also shares highest similarity among IFITM family
members. Lange et al. (2003) determined that IFITM5 is 1 of only 2 IFITM
genes conserved from mouse to human (see EVOLUTION).

GENE STRUCTURE

Lange et al. (2003) determined that the IFITM5 gene contains 2 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lange et al. (2003) mapped the IFITM5 gene
to an IFITM gene cluster on chromosome 11p15.5. The order of the genes,
from telomere to centromere, is IFITM5, IFITM2 (605578), IFITM1
(604456), and IFITM3 (605579), and the cluster spans about 26.5 kb.
Lange et al. (2003) stated that IFITM2 maps to the plus strand and that
all other IFITM genes map to the minus strand. However, Gross (2012)
determined that, in addition to IFITM2, the IFITM1 gene maps to the plus
strand based on an alignment of the IFITM1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
BC000897) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Lange et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Ifitm gene cluster to a region of
chromosome 7F5 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
11p15.5. The mouse Ifitm gene cluster contains 5 genes, whereas the
human cluster contains only 4 genes.

EVOLUTION

By phylogenetic analysis, Lange et al. (2003) found that only 2 mouse
fragilis genes, fragilis-4 (Ifitm5) and either fragilis (Ifitm3),
fragilis-2 (Ifitm1), or fragilis-3 (Ifitm2), have been conserved from
mouse to human. They suggested that subsequent gene duplications may
have occurred independently in both species.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

After mapping the locus for osteogenesis imperfecta type V (OI5; 610967)
in a Korean family to a region of chromosome 11 containing the IFITM5
gene, Cho et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous mutation in the
5-prime untranslated region of this gene (-14C-T; 614757.0001) in 19
affected Korean individuals (13 from 3 families and 6 simplex
individuals). The mutation was not found in unaffected family members or
in 200 unrelated control chromosomes from the same ethnic group.

Sempler et al. (2012) independently identified heterozygosity for the
-14C-T mutation in 2 unrelated patients with OI type V. The mutation
occurred de novo in both.

OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, TYPE V
IFITM5, -14C-T

In 19 Korean individuals (13 from 3 families and 6 simplex individuals)
with osteogenesis imperfecta type V (OI5; 610967), Cho et al. (2012)
identified a C-T transition 5-prime UTR of the IFITM5 gene (-14C-T).
Sempler et al. (2012) identified the same mutation in 2 unrelated
individuals with OI5. The mutation was predicted to generate an in-frame
translation start codon that would add 5 amino acids
(Met-Ala-Leu-Glu-Pro) to the N terminus of IFITM5, which was confirmed
in transfection experiments.

601540	TITLE *601540 BROMODOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; BRD2
;;FEMALE STERILE HOMEOTIC-RELATED GENE 1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; FSRG1;;
RING3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BRD2 is a putative nuclear transcriptional regulator and a member of a
family of genes that are expressed during development.

CLONING

In a search for novel genes in the human major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class II region on chromosome 6p21.3, Okamoto et al.
(1991) and Beck et al. (1992) identified a gene that they termed RING3.
('RING' is an acronym for 'really interesting new gene.') Based on
mapping and genomic sequencing, RING3 was located in the middle of the
class II region between the genes HLA-DNA (142930) and HLA-DMA (142855).
In contrast to all the other genes encoded in the class II region, RING3
appeared to have no obvious function associated with the immune system
based on sequence comparisons. The striking sequence similarity to the
female sterile homeotic (fsh) gene in Drosophila, however, suggested a
conserved biologic function for RING3.

Denis and Green (1996) discovered that the RING3 product is, in fact, a
mitogen-activated nuclear kinase involved in signal transduction and
that it is upregulated in certain types of leukemia.

With the aim of learning more about the phylogeny of RING3, Thorpe et
al. (1996) identified further homologs in different species and
determined their gene structures. The functional analysis of RING3 had
been further complicated by the finding of a second, non-MHC-linked copy
of RING3 in humans by Nomura et al. (1994). This was referred to by them
as ORFX (601541).

GENE FUNCTION

Dawson et al. (2011) demonstrated that I-BET151, a novel small molecule
inhibitor of the BET family, of which BRD2 is a member, has profound
efficacy against human and murine MLL-fusion leukemia cell lines through
the induction of early cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. I-BET151
treatment in 2 human leukemia cell lines with different MLL fusions
altered the expression of a common set of genes whose function may
account for these phenotypic changes. The mode of action of I-BET151 is,
at least in part, due to the inhibition of transcription at key genes
BCL2 (151430), C-MYC (190080), and CDK6 (603368) through the
displacement of BRD3/4, PAFc, and SEC components from chromatin. In vivo
studies indicated that I-BET151 has significant therapeutic value,
providing survival benefit in 2 distinct mouse models of murine MLL-AF9
and human MLL-AF4 leukemia.

gene and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, see EJM3 (608816).

603157	TITLE *603157 PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3-KINASE, REGULATORY SUBUNIT 2; PIK3R2
;;PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3-KINASE, REGULATORY SUBUNIT, 85-KD, BETA;;
p85-BETA
PIK3R2/UPS8 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is a lipid kinase that
phosphorylates the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol and related
compounds at the 3-prime position. The products of these reactions serve
as second messengers in growth signaling pathways. The kinase itself is
made up of a catalytic subunit of molecular mass 110 kD (PIK3CA; 171834)
and a regulatory subunit of either 85 kD, 55 kD, or 50 kD. Otsu et al.
(1991) showed that the bovine PI3K p85 subunit consists of 2 closely
related proteins, p85-alpha (171833) and p85-beta. They cloned cDNAs
encoding both p85 subunits, each of which is 724 amino acids long. The
subunits share 62% amino acid identity across their entire length. Both
sequences contain an N-terminal SH3 region, 2 SH2 regions, and a region
of homology to BCR (151410).

Janssen et al. (1998) determined the human p85-beta cDNA sequence.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional expression studies by Otsu et al. (1991) showed that both
bovine p85 subunits bound tyrosine kinase receptors.

Hale et al. (2006) generated a laryngeal carcinoma cell line
constitutively expressing influenza A virus NS1 protein and found that
NS1 bound specifically to p85-beta. The NS1 protein from various
influenza strains also bound p85-beta, but not p85-alpha. Expression of
NS1 led to induction of PI3K signaling, including phosphorylation of AKT
(164730) at ser473. Binding of p85-beta and activation of PI3K required
tyr89 of NS1, and mutant viruses expressing NS1 with a tyr89-to-phe
substitution grew more slowly in cell culture than wildtype viruses.
Hale et al. (2006) proposed that activation of PI3K signaling in
influenza A virus-infected cells is important for efficient virus
replication.

Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Park et al. (2010) showed that, in
addition to regulating PI3K function, p85-alpha and p85-beta regulated
the function of Xbp1s (XBP1; 194355), a transcription factor that
orchestrates the unfolded protein response (UPR) following endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress. Both p85-alpha and p85-beta bound Xbp1s and
increased its nuclear translocation, and it appeared that the p110 PI3K
catalytic subunit and Xbp1s competed for binding of these regulatory
subunits. p85-alpha and p85-beta formed an inactive dimer that was
disrupted by insulin in a time-dependent manner, which promoted their
association with Xbp1s. Refeeding of wildtype mice after fasting induced
ER stress that was quickly resolved, as measured by Xbp1s levels. In
contrast, obese and insulin-resistant ob/ob (LEP; 164160) mice could not
resolve the ER stress induced during refeeding, and nuclear
translocation of Xbp1s was absent in ob/ob mice. Overexpression of
p85-alpha or p85-beta in livers of ob/ob mice increased glucose
tolerance and reduced blood glucose concentrations.

To assess the impact of the AKT3 (611223), PIK3R2, and PIK3CA mutations
in individuals with megalencephaly-capillary malformation-polymicrogyria
syndrome (MCAP; 602501) and megalencephaly polymicrogyria-polydactyly
hydrocephalus syndrome (MPPH; 603387) on PI3K activity, Riviere et al.
(2012) used immunostaining to compare PIP3 amounts in lymphoblastoid
cell lines derived from 4 mutation carriers with megalencephaly to those
in control and PTEN (601728)-mutant cells. Consistent with elevated PI3K
activity, and similar to what is seen with PTEN loss, all 3 lines with
PIK3R2 or PIK3CA mutations showed significantly more PIP3 staining than
control cells, as well as greater localization of active
phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDPK1; 605213) to the cell
membrane. Treatment with the PI3K inhibitor PI-103 resulted in less PIP3
in the PIK3R2 G373R (603157.0001) and PIK3CA E453del (171834.0014)
mutant lines, confirming that these results are PI3K-dependent. Riviere
et al. (2012) found no evidence for increased PI3K activity in the
AKT3-mutant line, consistent with a mutation affecting a downstream
effector of PI3K. Protein blot analysis showed higher amounts of
phosphorylated S6 protein and 4E-BP1 in all mutant cell lines compared
to controls. Although PI-103 treatment reduced S6 phosphorylation in
control and mutant lines, the latter showed relative resistance to PI3K
inhibition, consistent with elevated signaling through the pathway.
Riviere et al. (2012) concluded that the megalencephaly-associated
mutations result in higher PI3K activity and PI3K-mTOR signaling.

MAPPING

Volinia et al. (1992) used in situ hybridization to map the PIK3R2 gene
to human chromosome 19q13.2-q13.4.

CYTOGENETICS

Janssen et al. (1998) analyzed DNA from a patient with chronic
myeloproliferative disorder. They identified an oncogenic fusion of the
5-prime end of p85-beta and the 3-prime end of HUMORF8 (USP8; 603158).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Riviere et al. (2012) performed exome sequencing in the oldest of 3
affected sibs with MPPH and identified a heterozygous mutation in the
PIK3R2 gene (G373R; 603157.0001). Sanger sequencing confirmed the
presence of the mutation in all 3 affected sibs and its absence in the
saliva and blood of both parents and the unaffected sister, showing
germline mosaicism in 1 parent. Sequencing of the PIK3R2 gene in 40
individuals with megalencephaly identified the same nucleotide change in
10 additional subjects with MPPH, and this mutation was shown to be de
novo in all subjects for whom parental DNA was available. The mutation
occurred at a CpG dinucleotide, which might explain its recurrence.

ANIMAL MODEL

Oak et al. (2006) crossed mice with a floxed Pik3r1 allele and a null
Pik3r2 allele with Lck (153390)-Cre transgenic mice to generate a strain
in which class IA Pi3k expression and function were essentially
abrogated in T cells beginning at the double-negative stage.
Histopathologic analysis of these mice showed development of
organ-specific autoimmunity resembling Sjogren syndrome (SS; 270150). By
3 to 8 months of age, mutant mice developed corneal opacity and eye
lesions due to irritation and constant scratching. Mutant mice showed
marked lymphocytic infiltration of lacrimal glands and serum antinuclear
and anti-Ssa (SSA1; 109092) antibodies, but no kidney pathology.
Cd4-positive T cells, which were the predominant infiltrating cells in
lacrimal glands of mutant mice, exhibited aberrant differentiation in
vitro. Oak et al. (2006) concluded that impaired class IA PI3K signaling
in T cells can lead to organ-specific autoimmunity, and they proposed
that class IA Pi3k-deficient mice manifest the cardinal features of
human primary SS.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MEGALENCEPHALY-POLYMICROGYRIA-POLYDACTYLY-HYDROCEPHALUS SYNDROME
PIK3R2, GLY373ARG

In 13 individuals with
megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome (MPPH;
603387) from 11 unrelated families, Riviere et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous 1117G-A transition in the PIK3R2 gene, resulting in a
gly373-to-arg (G373R) substitution in the PIK3R2 gene. This mutation was
shown to be de novo in all subjects for whom parental DNA was available.
The mutation occurred at a CpG dinucleotide, which might explain its
recurrence.

605301	TITLE *605301 TRANSFORMING, ACIDIC, COILED-COIL-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; TACC1
TACC1/FGFR1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Amplification of various chromosomal regions in human breast carcinomas
has lead to the identification of protooncogenes involved in
tumorigenesis. For example, MYC (190080) in 8q24, CCND1 (168461) in
11q13, and ERBB2 (164870) in 17q12 are each observed in 20% of all
breast tumors. Still et al. (1999) noted that 8p11 is amplified in 10 to
15% of breast tumor samples but the only gene assigned to this region,
FGFR1 (136350), is typically expressed at the same levels in normal and
tumor breast tissue. By PCR analysis with primers obtained from an EST
database, generation of a BAC contig spanning 380 kb of the 8p11 breast
cancer amplicon-1, and probing fetal tissue libraries, Still et al.
(1999) isolated a cDNA encoding TACC1. The predicted 805-amino acid
TACC1 protein is rich in serine, proline, and acidic residues, has a
20-amino acid N terminus rich in tryptophan, contains 2 nuclear
localization signals but no DNA- or RNA-binding domains, and has a
200-residue C terminus with extensive alpha-helical segments expected to
adopt a coiled-coil structure. Northern blot analysis detected a major
8.0-kb TACC1 transcript in all tissues tested, with relatively weak
expression in liver and lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Still et al. (1999) found that introduction of TACC1 into stable cell
lines resulted in morphologic changes consistent with a transformed
phenotype and in anchorage-independent growth.

By yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, Lauffart et al.
(2002) showed that TACC1 interacted with C-terminal regions of CHTOG
(CKAP5; 611142) and GAS41 (YEATS4; 602116).

During neurogenesis, the nuclei of progenitor cells of the proliferative
ventricular zone oscillate in a cell cycle-dependent manner called
interkinetic nuclear migration (INM). In most cell types, the nucleus
closely follows the centrosome during migration; however, in neural
progenitors, centrosomes remain near the ventricular zone during INM.
Xie et al. (2007) showed that INM in mice was dependent on the
regulation of centrosome-associated microtubules by Cep120 (613446) and
Taccs. Cep120 and Taccs regulated the integrity of microtubules coupling
the centrosome and the nucleus. Cep120 interacted with Taccs and
regulated the localization of Tacc3 (605303) to the centrosome. Both
Cep120 and Taccs were essential for maintaining the neural progenitor
pool during mouse neocortical development.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Singh et al. (2012) reported that a small subset of glioblastoma
multiforme tumors (GBMs; 137800) (3.1%; 3 of 97 tumors examined) harbors
oncogenic chromosomal translocations that fuse in-frame the tyrosine
kinase coding domains of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes
FGFR1 (136350) or FGFR3 (134934) to the transforming acidic coiled-coil
(TACC) coding domains of TACC1 or TACC3 (605303), respectively. The
FGFR-TACC fusion protein displayed oncogenic activity when introduced
into astrocytes or stereotactically transduced in the mouse brain. The
fusion protein, which localizes to mitotic spindle poles, has
constitutive kinase activity and induces mitotic and chromosomal
segregation defects and triggers aneuploidy. Inhibition of FGFR kinase
corrected the aneuploidy, and oral administration of an FGFR inhibitor
prolonged survival of mice harboring intracranial FGFR3-TACC3-initiated
glioma. Singh et al. (2012) concluded that FGFR-TACC fusions could
potentially identify a subset of GBM patients who would benefit from
targeted FGFR kinase inhibition.

611589	TITLE *611589 PATATIN-LIKE PHOSPHOLIPASE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5; PNPLA5
;;GS2-LIKE PROTEIN; GS2L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Human patatin-like phospholipases, such as PNPLA5, have been implicated
in regulation of adipocyte differentiation and have been induced by
metabolic stimuli (Wilson et al., 2006).

CLONING

By database analysis, followed by screening of human EST databases,
Wilson et al. (2006) identified PNPLA5, which encodes a 429-amino acid
protein containing a patatin-like domain and 2 glycosaminoglycan sites.
Structural analysis determined that the patatin-like domain was composed
of a beta-sheet sandwiched by alpha-helices in approximately 3 layers.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that PNPLA5 was expressed at
moderate levels in brain and at very low levels in liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Gao and Simon (2007) measured retinol transacylation activity and found
that PNPLA5 appeared to inhibit transacylation catalyzed by endogenous
enzymes, but it had measurable retinylester hydrolysis activity.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PNPLA5
gene to chromosome 22 (TMAP G65439).

603647	TITLE *603647 BCS1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG-LIKE; BCS1L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The human BCS1L gene encodes a homolog of S. cerevisiae bcs1 protein
involved in the assembly of complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory
chain.

CLONING

The S. cerevisiae bcs1 protein is a constituent of the inner
mitochondrial membrane and is required for the expression of functional
ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase (bc1) complex (see 191328). The bcs1
protein shares sequence similarity with members of the AAA (ATPases
associated with various cellular activities) superfamily (see 601681).
By searching an EST database for sequences related to bcs1, Petruzzella
et al. (1998) identified a cDNA encoding human BCS1L (BCS1-like). The
predicted 420-amino acid human protein is 50% identical to yeast bcs1
and, like bcs1, contains 2 conserved nucleotide-binding motifs. Although
BCS1L does not contain an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence,
in vitro mitochondrial import and trypsin-protection assays demonstrated
that it is imported into mitochondria. Northern blot analysis revealed
that BCS1L is expressed ubiquitously as a 1.4-kb mRNA. The authors also
detected a 4.5-kb transcript that they considered to be either an
alternative BCS1L mRNA or an mRNA derived from a related gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Found within the inner mitochondrial membrane, BCS1L is presumed to
facilitate insertion of Rieske Fe/S protein into precursors to complex
III during assembly of the respiratory chain (Cruciat et al., 1999).
Complex III then becomes assembled with complexes IV and I into a
respirasome supercomplex that facilitates the electron transfer required
for the synthesis of ATP.

MAPPING

Based on sequence similarity to ESTs, Petruzzella et al. (1998)
tentatively mapped the BCS1L gene to 2q33.

GENE STRUCTURE

De Lonlay et al. (2001) showed that the BCS1L gene consists of 7 exons.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Mitochondrial Complex III Deficiency, Nuclear Type 1

De Lonlay et al. (2001) found 4 biallelic mutations in the BCS1L gene in
6 patients from 4 families with mitochondrial complex III deficiency
nuclear type 1 (MC3DN1; 124000) characterized by neonatal proximal
tubulopathy, hepatic involvement, and encephalopathy. Complementation
studies in yeast confirmed the deleterious effect of these missense
mutations. De Lonlay et al. (2001) suggested that mutation of BCS1L is a
frequent cause of complex III deficiency, as one-third of their Turkish
patients had mutations in the BSC1L gene. De Lonlay et al. (2001)
reported that they had not been able to detect BCS1L mutations in
complex III-deficient patients with clinical presentations other than
neonatal tubulopathy with hepatic involvement and encephalopathy.

- GRACILE Syndrome

The GRACILE (growth retardation, amino aciduria, cholestasis, iron
overload, lactic acidosis, and early death) syndrome (603358) belongs to
the disease heritage of Finland. All affected families carry the same
ancestral haplotype on 2q33-q37, indicating 1 founder mutation (Visapaa
et al., 1998). Visapaa et al. (2002) identified a homozygous
ser78-to-gly mutation (S78G; 603358.0005) in the BCS1L gene in all
Finnish patients with GRACILE syndrome studied. In addition, they
identified 5 different mutations in the BCS1L gene in 3 British infants,
previously reported by Morris et al. (1995), whose symptoms resembled
those in GRACILE syndrome but who also had complex III deficiency and
neurologic symptoms. The phenotype of the Turkish patients in whom de
Lonlay et al. (2001) demonstrated mutations in the BCS1L gene was
distinctly different from that of the Finnish patients. Whereas the
Turkish patients had complex III deficiency, the Finnish patients had
complex III activity within the normal range. The Finnish patients had
no neurologic problems, but had marked hepatic iron overload, associated
with abnormal levels of proteins involved in iron transfer and storage,
and free plasma iron. These findings implied that BCS1L has another
cellular function that is uncharacterized but essential, and that it is
putatively involved in iron metabolism.

- Bjornstad Syndrome

Bjornstad syndrome (262000) is an autosomal recessive condition
characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and pili torti. Lubianca
Neto et al. (1998) mapped the Bjornstad syndrome locus to 2q34-q36.
Hinson et al. (2007) refined the map location of the disorder to 2q35
and demonstrated mutations in the BCS1L gene (e.g., 603647.0001).

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

To understand how BCS2L mutations cause such widely different clinical
phenotypes, Hinson et al. (2007) considered the locations of defects on
the BCS1L protein structure and compared the function of mutant BCS1L in
yeast and in human lymphocytes. Their studies showed that all BCS1L
mutations disrupted the assembly of mitochondrial respirasomes (the
basic unit of respiration in human mitochondria), but the clinical
severity of the mutations was correlated with the production of reactive
oxygen species. The data indicated that in addition to mitochondrial
heteroplasmy and variable energy requirements of tissues,
tissue-specific sensitivities to reactive oxygen species contribute to
the variability of the manifestations of mitochondrial defects.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, SER277ASN

In 2 affected sibs and 1 fetus in a consanguineous family with
mitochondrial complex III deficiency nuclear type 1 (MC3DN1; 124000)
characterized by neonatal tubulopathy, encephalopathy, and liver
failure, de Lonlay et al. (2001) identified a homozygous 830G-A
transition in the BCS1L gene, resulting in a ser277-to-asp (S277N)
substitution.

.0002
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY
BCS1L, PRO99LEU

In 2 patients with complex III deficiency (124000), a boy and a girl,
born to unrelated consanguineous families, de Lonlay et al. (2001)
identified the same homozygous C-to-T transition at nucleotide 296 in
exon 1 of the BCS1L gene, causing the substitution of a leucine for a
highly conserved proline at codon 99 (P99L). The patients had metabolic
acidosis, hepatic involvement, neurologic deterioration, and brainstem
and basal ganglia lesions consistent with a diagnosis of Leigh syndrome
(256000). One patient had abnormal ventilation patterns and proximal
renal tubulopathy.

.0003
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, ARG155PRO

In a boy of Turkish origin with complex III deficiency (124000) born to
nonconsanguineous parents, de Lonlay et al. (2001) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the BCS1L gene: a 464C-G transversion
in exon 3 of the BCS1L gene, resulting in an arg155-to-pro (R155P)
substitution, and a 1057G-A transition in exon 7, resulting in a
val353-to-met (V353M; 603647.0004) substitution.

.0005
GRACILE SYNDROME
BCS1L, SER78GLY

Visapaa et al. (2002) reported that all GRACILE syndrome (603358)
patients in Finland were homozygous for a 232A-G mutation in exon 2 of
the BCS1L gene, resulting in a ser78-to-gly (S78G) substitution. Unlike
the Turkish patients reported by de Lonlay et al. (2001), the Finnish
patients had normal complex III activity and no neurologic problems, but
did have marked iron overload.

.0006
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, ARG45CYS

In 2 Spanish sibs with fatal infantile complex III deficiency (124000),
De Meirleir et al. (2003) identified compound heterozygosity for
mutation in the BCS1L gene: a 246C-T transition in exon 1, resulting in
an arg45-to-cys (R45C) substitution, and a 279C-T transition in exon 1,
resulting in an arg56-to-ter (R56X; 603647.0007) substitution. The R45C
substitution occurs in a crucial targeting signal of the gene and is
predicted to interfere with proper protein functioning. Each parent was
heterozygous for 1 of the mutations. Both patients had severe metabolic
acidosis noted shortly after birth, as well as severe liver dysfunction
and a renal tubulopathy. One died at age 3 weeks of lactic acidosis. The
second infant also had obvious neurologic involvement, with delayed
myelination, axial hypotonia, and developmental delay. He died at age 3
months. Postmortem liver examination of both infants showed liver
fibrosis, severe cholestasis, and hepatosiderosis with accumulation of
iron in aggregates of macrophages and in Kupffer cells. Mitochondria
appeared enlarged with few or no cristae and a fluffy matrix. De
Meirleir et al. (2003) suggested that the iron accumulation could be
explained by the lack of incorporation of iron in the iron-sulfur
cluster of complex III.

Ramos-Arroyo et al. (2009) reported another Spanish infant with the R45C
and R56X mutations. She presented with neonatal severe hypotonia, food
intolerance, and vomiting. She soon developed a proximal renal
tubulopathy with glucosuria, phosphaturia, and aminoaciduria, metabolic
lactic acidosis, and hepatic involvement. Bilateral cataracts were also
noted. At age 4 months, she showed nystagmus, hypertonia, microcephaly,
developmental delay, and failure to thrive. Her neurologic condition and
metabolic acidosis worsened rapidly, and she died at 6 months of age.
Biochemical studies of muscle tissue showed impaired activity of
mitochondrial complex III. Ramos-Arroyo et al. (2009) noted that this
child did not have evidence of altered iron metabolism, as had been
observed in the patients reported by De Meirleir et al. (2003), and as
has been observed in patients with the allelic disorder GRACILE syndrome
(603358). Ramos-Arroyo et al. (2009) postulated that phenotypic
variability even in individuals with the same BCS1L genotype may reflect
tissue-specific expression of the mutant gene.

BJORNSTAD SYNDROME
BCS1L, ARG183HIS

In affected members of the family with Bjornstad syndrome (262000) in
which Lubianca Neto et al. (1998) demonstrated linkage to 2q, Hinson et
al. (2007) identified homozygosity for a C-to-T transition in the BCS1L
gene, resulting in an arg183-to-his (R183H) substitution. Eight
individuals in 2 sibships related as first cousins once removed were
affected; the parents in each case were consanguineous.

.0009
BJORNSTAD SYNDROME WITH MILD MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1, INCLUDED
BCS1L, ARG184CYS

In a sporadic case of Bjornstad syndrome (262000) with mild
mitochondrial complex III deficiency (124000), Hinson et al. (2007)
found compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in the BCS1L
gene: arg184 to cys (R184C) and gly35 to arg (G35R; 603647.0010).

In a Moroccan girl with mitochondrial complex III deficiency (124000),
Fernandez-Vizarra et al. (2007) identified compound heterozygosity for
the R184C mutation and a 547C-T transition in exon 3 of the BCS1L gene,
resulting in an arg183-to-cys (R183C; 603647.0012) substitution. She
presented at age 9 months with acute psychomotor regression, hypotonia,
and failure to thrive, which progressed to spastic quadriparesis and
mental retardation associated with abnormal signal intensities in the
thalami, basal ganglia, and periventricular white matter, consistent
with an encephalopathy. Heart, liver, and kidneys were apparently
unaffected, but she was also noted to have brittle hair. Studies in
yeast showed that both mutations significantly reduced mitochondrial
cytochrome content and respiratory activity, as well as caused a
decreased incorporation of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (UQCRFS1;
191327) into complex III. Further studies showed decreased levels of
fully assembled complex III. The findings suggested that BCS1L is
necessary for proper complex III assembly.

MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, THR50ALA

In a 4-year-old Spanish boy with isolated mitochondrial complex III
deficiency (124000), Blazquez et al. (2009) identified a homozygous
148A-G transition in exon 1 of the BCS1L gene, resulting in a
thr50-to-ala (T50A) substitution in the mitochondrial sorting sequence.
He presented at 6 months of age with psychomotor retardation, failure to
thrive, hypotonia, lactic acidosis, and hepatic dysfunction. Physical
examination showed unstable head support, poor eye fixation, coarse
facies, and epicanthus. There was hypertrichosis of the frontal head
zone and limbs, and excessive fat distribution in the upper back, neck,
hands and feet, with almost no fat on the limbs. Respiratory chain
activity in muscle and fibroblasts showed an isolated complex III defect
(58% of normal in muscle, 93% in fibroblasts). At age 4 years, he still
showed psychomotor retardation, had developed mild sensorineural hearing
loss, and persistent lactic acidemia, but renal function, hair, and iron
metabolism were normal. Brain MRI was normal. The mutation was not found
in 400 control alleles, and each unaffected parent was heterozygous for
the mutation.
