137240	TITLE *137240 GASTRIC INHIBITORY POLYPEPTIDE; GIP
;;GLUCOSE-DEPENDENT INSULINOTROPIC POLYPEPTIDE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Gastric inhibitory polypeptide, also known as glucose-dependent
insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), is a 42-amino acid hormone that
stimulates insulin (INS; 176730) secretion in the presence of glucose.
Its sequence indicates that it is a member of a family of structurally
related hormones that includes secretin (182099), glucagon (138030),
vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP; 192320), and growth
hormone-releasing factor (GHRH; 139190) (summary by Takeda et al.,
1987).

CLONING

Takeda et al. (1987) isolated and sequenced cDNA clones encoding the
human GIP precursor from a human duodenal cDNA library. The predicted
amino acid sequence of the precursor indicates that GIP is derived by
proteolytic processing of a 153-residue precursor, preproGIP, which has
a predicted molecular mass of 17.1 kD. The GIP moiety is flanked by
polypeptide segments of 51 and 60 amino acids at its amino and carboxyl
termini, respectively. GIP is released from the precursor by processing
at single arginine residues present at each end of the GIP sequence.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNAs and by in situ
hybridization using a GIP cDNA, Fukushima et al. (1989) and Inagaki et
al. (1989) mapped the human GIP gene to chromosome 17q21.3-q22.

By genetic linkage studies using multiple DNA markers from the 17q12-q21
region, Anderson et al. (1993) placed GIP on the genetic map of the
region in a position distal to HOX2B (142961) and GP3A (173470). By
genetic mapping through CEPH reference families and by high-resolution
radiation hybrid mapping, Lewis et al. (1994) concluded that the GIP
gene is in a tight cluster in the following order:
cen--PPY--HOXB6--NGFR--GIP--NME1--tel. GIP was estimated to lie 250 kb
distal to NGFR (162010).

Mohlke et al. (1996) demonstrated that the Gip gene is located in the
distal portion of mouse chromosome 11, closely linked to Mvwf (see
111730) and between Ngfr and Hoxb9.

GENE FUNCTION

Cheung et al. (2000) found that gut K cells could be induced to produce
human insulin by providing the cells with the human INS gene linked to
the 5-prime regulatory region of the GIP gene. Mice expressing this
transgene produced human insulin specifically in gut K cells. This
insulin protected the mice from developing diabetes (see 222100) and
maintained glucose tolerance after destruction of the native
insulin-producing beta cells.

613620	TITLE *613620 TBC1 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 10B; TBC1D10B
;;RAB27AGAP-BETA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Small G proteins of the RAB family (see 179508) function in
intracellular vesicle trafficking by switching from the GTP-bound state
to the GDP-bound state with the assistance of guanine nucleotide
exchange factors (GEFs; see 609700) and GTPase-activating proteins
(GAPs). TBC1D10B functions as a GAP for several proteins of the Rab
family (Ishibashi et al., 2009).

CLONING

By database analysis, Itoh and Fukuda (2006) determined that the deduced
533-amino acid TBC1D10B protein, which they called RAB27AGAP-beta,
contains a central TRE2 (USP6; 604334)/yeast Bub2/CDC16 (603461) (TBC)
domain and a C-terminal DAYF motif. The TBC domain is predicted to
function as a RabGAP, and the DAYF motif is predicted to interact with
PDZ domains. TBC1D10B shares highest sequence similarity with EPI64
(TBC1D10A; 610020). The TBC domains of TBC1D10B and TBC1D10A are 81%
identical, and both contain a highly conserved catalytic arginine.
Fluorescence-tagged TBC1D10B localized to the plasma membrane of
transfected mouse melanoma cells.

Ishibashi et al. (2009) found that fluorescence-tagged TBC1D10B
localized near the plasma membrane of differentiated rat PC12
pheochromocytoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By screening human and mouse cDNAs encoding putative RabGAPs for the
ability to catalyze GTP exchange in Rab proteins, Itoh and Fukuda (2006)
found that both TBC1D10A and TBC1D10B functioned as GAPs for mouse
Rab27a (603868) and induced melanosome aggregation in a mouse melanocyte
cell line. Both TBC1D10A and TBC1D10B increased the GTPase activity of
Rab27a and reduced the amount of GTP-Rab27a when coexpressed with
Rab27a.

Endogenous Rab3a (179490) is present on dense-core vesicles in the
distal portion of neurites in differentiated rat PC12 cells. By
overexpressing TBC1D10B in PC12 cells, Ishibashi et al. (2009) found
that TBC1D10B functioned as a GAP for Rab3a, reducing association of
Rab3a with neurites. Mutation of the catalytic arg134 in the TBC domain
of TBC1D10B completely inhibited its GAP activity against Rab3a in PC12
and transfected COS-7 cells. TBC1D10B also showed significant GAP
activity toward Rab22a (612966), Rab27a, and Rab35 (604199), but not
Rab2a (RAB2; 179509) or Rab6a (179513).

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the TBC1D10B gene to chromosome 16p11.2 based on an
alignment of the TBC1D10B sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC063112) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;GOLGI-ASSOCIATED PR1 PROTEIN; GAPR1;;
CHROMOSOME 9 OPEN READING FRAME 19; C9ORF19
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a positional cloning strategy, Eisenberg et al. (2002) identified
a novel transcript in the critical region for IBM2 (600737) on
chromosome 9p13-p12. They cloned the full-length cDNA, designated
C9ORF19, from a human placenta cDNA library. C9ORF19 encodes a deduced
154-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 17.2 kD.
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.9-kb transcript in most adult
tissues tested, with highest expression in lung and peripheral
leukocytes and minor expression in liver and kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

Eisenberg et al. (2002) determined that the GLIPR2 gene contains 5 exons
and spans more than 27 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Shoji-Kawata et al. (2013) showed that a peptide, Tat-beclin-1, derived
from a region of the autophagy protein beclin-1 (604378), which binds
HIV-1 Nef, is a potent inducer of autophagy, and interacts with a
negative regulator of autophagy, GAPR1 (also called GLIPR2).
Tat-beclin-1 decreases the accumulation of polyglutamine expansion
protein aggregates and the replication of several pathogens, including
HIV-1, in vitro, and reduces mortality in mice infected with chikungunya
or West Nile virus. Shoji-Kawata et al. (2013) concluded that, through
the characterization of a domain of beclin-1 that interacts with HIV-1
Nef, they have developed an autophagy-inducing peptide that has
potential efficacy in the treatment of human diseases.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Eisenberg et al. (2002) mapped the GLIPR2 gene to
chromosome 9p13-p12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By mutation analysis in patients with IBM2, Eisenberg et al. (2002)
excluded C9ORF19 as the disease-causing gene.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PLPLA2 is a triglyceride lipase (EC 3.1.1.3) that localizes to lipid
droplets and catalyzes the initial step in triglyceride hydrolysis
(Zimmermann et al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching for genes expressed exclusively in mouse adipose tissue,
Villena et al. (2004) cloned Pnpla2, which they designated desnutrin.
The deduced 486-amino acid protein contains a highly conserved 180-amino
acid N-terminal patatin domain with a glycine-rich region, an active
serine hydrolase motif, and an aspartate active site motif. By database
analysis, Villena et al. (2004) identified human PNPLA2, which shows 88%
amino acid homology to mouse desnutrin. Northern blot analysis detected
a 2.0-kb transcript expressed at high levels in mouse brown and white
adipose tissue and at intermediate levels in heart and testis. Very low
expression was detected in all other mouse tissues examined. Expression
of desnutrin was lower in gonadal fat deposits of genetically obese mice
compared with wildtype mice. Desnutrin mRNA was found only in mature
adipocytes and not in proliferating or confluent mouse preadipocytes.
Expression was rapidly increased in cells induced to differentiate.

GENE FUNCTION

Villena et al. (2004) found that desnutrin mRNA levels were regulated by
the nutritional status of mice, being transiently induced during
fasting. In vitro desnutrin gene expression was upregulated by
dexamethasone in a dose-dependent manner, but not by cAMP, suggesting
that glucocorticoids could mediate the increased desnutrin mRNA levels
observed during fasting.

Zimmermann et al. (2004) reported that an enzyme besides
hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; 151750) that they called 'adipose
triglyceride lipase (ATGL)' catalyzes the initial step in triglyceride
hydrolysis in mammalian adipose tissue. ATGL contains a 'patatin domain'
common to plant acyl-hydrolases. ATGL is highly expressed in adipose
tissue of mice and humans. It exhibits high substrate specificity for
triacylglycerol and is associated with lipid droplets. Inhibition of
ATGL markedly decreased total adipose acyl-hydrolase activity. Thus,
Zimmermann et al. (2004) concluded that ATGL and hormone-sensitive
lipase coordinately catabolize stored triglycerides in adipose tissue of
mammals.

Jenkins et al. (2004) found that purified recombinant PNPLA3 (609567),
PNPLA2, and GS2 (PNPLA4; 300102) expressed in insect cells showed
abundant triacylglycerol lipase activity. The recombinant enzymes also
showed acylglycerol transacylase activity by transferring the acyl donor
mono-olein to mono-olein or diolein acceptors to form diolein and
triolein, respectively.

Using a cell culture model and various biochemical approaches, Wang et
al. (2011) investigated the mechanisms by which perilipin-1 (PLIN1;
170290), PLIN2 (103195), and PLIN5 (613248) control lipolysis by ATGL
and its colipase, CGI58 (ABHD5; 604780). PLIN5 exerted a negative
regulatory role in lipid droplet hydrolysis by binding and inhibiting
ATGL activity at the lipid droplet surface under basal conditions. Even
after protein kinase A (PKA; see 188830) activation, release of fatty
acid was only modestly increased. In contrast, recruitment of CGI58,
followed by interaction with ATGL, increased lipolysis. Neither PLIN1
nor PLIN2 directly interacted with ATGL. Wang et al. (2011) proposed
that PLIN5 plays a critical role in oxidative tissues (e.g., heart and
skeletal muscle) to protect mitochondria from a rapid increase of fatty
acid during lipolysis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fischer et al. (2007) reported that the PNPLA2 gene comprises 9 coding
exons.

MAPPING

The Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PNPLA2 gene to
chromosome 11 (TMAP A009K14). Villena et al. (2004) mapped the mouse
Pnpla2 gene to chromosome 7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 patients with a neutral lipids storage disorder (NLSD) associated
with mild myopathy but not ichthyosis (NLSDM; 610717), Fischer et al.
(2007) detected mutations in the PNPLA2 gene. One individual was a
compound heterozygote for a 1-bp deletion (808delC; 609059.0001) and a
missense mutation (P195L; 609059.0002). The second was homozygous for a
1-bp deletion (847delC; 609059.0003). The third was homozygous for a
nonsense mutation (Q289X; 609059.0004). Fischer et al. (2007) considered
the PNPLA2 gene as a good candidate for mutations causing this disorder
because PNPLA2 is activated by ABHD5 (604780), mutations in which cause
another NLSD, that with ichthyosis (NLSDI), also called Chanarin-Dorfman
syndrome (CDS; 275630). Fischer et al. (2007) noted that the 808delC,
847delC, and Q289X mutations severely alter and delete the C-terminal
region of the protein, which includes the putative lipid-binding site.
They suggested that loss of the C-terminal region could explain the low
activity of the lipid droplet-associated lipase and the defect in
triglyceride catabolism, while the intact N-terminal region containing
the catalytic site may retain lipase activity, explaining the normal in
vitro lipase activity in whole lysate of fibroblasts.

Reilich et al. (2011) identified biallelic mutations in the PNPLA2 gene
(see, e.g., 609059.0002; 609059.0009-609059.0010) in 6 patients,
including 2 sibs, with NLSDM. Mutations in 5 of the patients resulted in
a lack of protein expression. The patients had adult onset of muscle
weakness affecting primarily the shoulder girdle but sometimes affecting
the lower limbs and distal muscles of the fingers and feet. Some
patients developed cardiac involvement later in the disease course. All
had increased serum creatine kinase, most had increased serum
triglycerides, and all had Jordans bodies on peripheral blood smear,
consistent with multisystem lipid accumulation. Other, more variable
features included diabetes, hepatic steatosis, and sensorineural hearing
loss. Activation of hormone-sensitive lipase by beta-adrenergic agents
such as clenbuterol appeared to bypass the enzymatic block in
PNPLA2-deficient patient cells in vitro, suggesting a possible
therapeutic approach.

In 3 unrelated Han Chinese patients with adult-onset neutral lipid
storage disease with myopathy, Lin et al. (2012) identified 4 different
mutations in the PNPLA2 gene (609059.0005-609059.0008). All mutations
occurred in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state.

ANIMAL MODEL

Das et al. (2011) showed that inhibition of lipolysis through genetic
ablation of Atgl or hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; 151750) ameliorated
certain features of cancer-associated cachexia. In wildtype C57BL/6
mice, the injection of Lewis lung carcinoma or B16 melanoma cells causes
tumor growth, loss of white adipose tissue, and a marked reduction of
gastrocnemius muscle. In contrast, Atgl-deficient mice with tumors
resisted increased white adipose tissue lipolysis, myocyte apoptosis,
and proteasomal muscle degradation and maintained normal adipose and
gastrocnemius muscle mass. Hsl-deficient mice with tumors were also
protected, although to a lesser degree. Das et al. (2011) concluded that
functional lipolysis is essential in the pathogenesis of
cancer-associated cachexia.

Haemmerle et al. (2011) found that Atgl knockout in mice resulted in
cardiac insufficiency and premature death. Cardiac dysfunction was
associated with excessive lipid and glycogen accumulation, disrupted
substrate oxidation and respiration in predominantly subsarcolemmal
mitochondria, reduced expression of Ppar-alpha (PPARA; 170998) and
Ppar-delta (PPARD; 600409) target genes, including genes directly
involved in fatty acid and glucose metabolism, and reduced expression of
Pgc1-alpha (PPARGC1A; 604517) and Pgc1-beta (PPARGC1B; 608886).
Atgl-null mice also showed defective expression of Ppar-alpha and
Ppar-delta target genes in liver, but decreased expression of Pgc1-alpha
and Pgc1-beta was specific to cardiac muscle. Conditional Atgl deletion
in heart and skeletal muscle only resulted in a cardiac phenotype
identical to that in Atgl -/- mice. Reexpression of an Atgl transgene in
hearts of Atgl -/- mice entirely rescued the lethal cardiac phenotype,
increased expression of Ppar-alpha and Ppar-delta target genes and
Pgc1-alpha and Pgc1-beta, restored the metabolic profile, and increased
life span to a level indistinguishable from wildtype. Treatment of Atgl
-/- mice with Ppar-alpha agonists, but not Ppar-delta agonists,
completely reversed all pathologic effects of Atgl deletion. Haemmerle
et al. (2011) concluded that ATGL is required for cardiac mitochondrial
function and activation of lipids as signaling molecules.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DEL, 808C

In a female from the Netherlands with neutral lipid storage disease with
myopathy (NLSDM; 610717), Fischer et al. (2007) detected compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the PNPLA2 gene. A 1-bp deletion in exon
7 (808delC) led to frameshift and a premature stop codon at amino acid
position 319. The other allele carried a missense mutation
(609059.0002).

.0002
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, PRO195LEU

The patient of Fischer et al. (2007) from the Netherlands with neutral
lipid storage disease with myopathy (NLSDM; 610717) carried a 584C-T
transition in exon 5 of the PNPLA2 gene that led to a pro195-to-leu
substitution (P195L). This mutation is localized on the border of the
N-terminal patatin domain in a region that is conserved in 5 proteins of
the PNPLA family and in homologous genes conserved in bilateral animals.
The other allele of the patient carried a 1-bp deletion (609059.0001).

Reilich et al. (2011) reported a 45-year-old woman from Newfoundland
with NLSDM and a homozygous P195L mutation in the PNPLA2 gene. She had
onset of slowly progressive myopathy in her twenties, followed by severe
congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy by her late thirties. She
also developed diabetes mellitus. The proximal muscles were more
severely affected. Her father died of dilated cardiomyopathy at age 57.
The proband also carried a homozygous G483R substitution in the PNPLA2
gene, which was of uncertain significance.

.0003
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DEL, 847C

In a French patient with neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy
(NLSDM; 610717), Fischer et al. (2007) detected homozygosity for a 1-bp
deletion in exon 7 of the PNPLA2 gene, 847delC, leading to frameshift
and a premature stop codon at amino acid position 319. This patient
developed diabetes at age 12 and died from cardiovascular complications
at age 34.

.0004
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, GLN289TER

In an Algerian patient with neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy
(NLSDM; 610717), Fischer et al. (2007) found homozygosity for an 865C-T
transition in exon 7 of the PNPLA2 gene that substituted a stop codon
for the glutamine at codon 289 (Q289X).

.0005
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, IVS6DS, T-C, +2

In a 44-year-old Han Chinese man with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Lin et
al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
PNPLA2 gene: a T-to-C transition in intron 6, and a 749A-C transversion
resulting in a gln250-to-pro (Q250P; 609059.0006) substitution. RT-PCR
of patient skeletal muscle detected only the Q250P mutant mRNA,
indicating that absence of the transcript results from the splice site
mutation. The Q250P mutation was not found in 50 controls.

In a 48-year-old Han Chinese woman with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Lin
et al. (2012) identified a homozygous G-to-T transversion in intron 6 of
the PNPLA2 gene. No PNPLA2 transcript was detected by RT-PCR analysis of
mRNA from skeletal muscle.

.0008
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DEL, 467C

In a 39-year-old Han Chinese man with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Lin et
al. (2012) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (467delC) in the PNPLA2
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination
(Pro156LeufsTer100).

.0009
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DUP, 613C

In 2 Turkish sibs with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Reilich et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1-bp duplication (c.613dupC) in exon 5 of the
PNPLA2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The
mutant transcript was predicted to undergo nonsense-mediated mRNA decay,
resulting in a lack of protein. Muscle weakness primarily affected the
proximal upper limbs, although both patients also had some distal
involvement, including of the lower limbs in 1. Serum creatine kinase
and triglycerides were increased. Both patients had hepatic steatosis,
but neither had cardiac involvement. Jordans bodies were present in
peripheral blood.

.0010
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DEL, 543C

In a British man with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Reilich et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (c.543delC) in exon 5 of the
PNPLA2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The
mutant transcript was predicted to undergo nonsense-mediated mRNA decay,
resulting in a lack of protein. At age 28 years, the patient developed
slowly progressive muscle weakness affecting the proximal upper and
lower limbs. At age 52 years, he had Gowers sign, distal muscle weakness
of the upper and lower extremities, and cardiac involvement. He also had
sensorineural hearing loss since childhood. Jordans bodies were present
in peripheral blood.

.0011
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 4-BP DUP, 475CTCC

In a 35-year-old Japanese woman with NLSDM (610717), Akiyama et al.
(2007) identified a homozygous 4-bp duplication (c.475_478dupCTCC) in
exon 4 of the PNPLA2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination in the patatin domain (Gln160ProfsTer19). The mutation was
not found in 100 control alleles or in 50 unrelated Japanese
individuals. She had delayed walking and slow running from childhood,
with severe upper and lower limb involvement as an adult. However, she
did not have cardiac involvement. Imaging showed fatty replacement of
multiple skeletal muscles, and skeletal muscle biopsy showed
accumulation of neutral lipid droplets.

116806	TITLE *116806 CATENIN, BETA-1; CTNNB1
;;CADHERIN-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, BETA; CTNNB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Beta-catenin is an adherens junction protein. Adherens junctions (AJs;
also called the zonula adherens) are critical for the establishment and
maintenance of epithelial layers, such as those lining organ surfaces.
AJs mediate adhesion between cells, communicate a signal that
neighboring cells are present, and anchor the actin cytoskeleton. In
serving these roles, AJs regulate normal cell growth and behavior. At
several stages of embryogenesis, wound healing, and tumor cell
metastasis, cells form and leave epithelia. This process, which involves
the disruption and reestablishment of epithelial cell-cell contacts, may
be regulated by the disassembly and assembly of AJs. AJs may also
function in the transmission of the 'contact inhibition' signal, which
instructs cells to stop dividing once an epithelial sheet is complete
(summary by Peifer, 1993).

CLONING

As reviewed by Peifer (1993), the AJ is a multiprotein complex assembled
around calcium-regulated cell adhesion molecules called cadherins (e.g.,
114020 and 114021). Cadherins are transmembrane proteins: the
extracellular domain mediates homotypic adhesion with cadherins on
neighboring cells, and the intracellular domain interacts with
cytoplasmic proteins that transmit the adhesion signal and anchor the AJ
to the actin cytoskeleton. These cytoplasmic proteins include the alpha-
(116805), beta-, and gamma-catenins. The beta-catenin gene, which was
cloned by McCrea et al. (1991), shows no similarity in sequence to the
genes for the alpha-catenins. The beta-catenin protein shares 70% amino
acid identity with both plakoglobin (173325), which is found in
desmosomes (another type of intracellular junction), and the product of
the Drosophila segment polarity gene 'armadillo.' Armadillo is part of a
multiprotein AJ complex in Drosophila that also includes some homologs
of alpha-catenin and cadherin, and genetic studies indicate that it is
required for cell adhesion and cytoskeletal integrity. The armadillo
gene was originally identified as one of a group of segment polarity
genes that regulate pattern formation of the Drosophila embryonic
cuticle.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nollet et al. (1996) showed that the CTNNB1 gene has 16 exons and spans
23.2 kb. Alternative splicing within exon 16 produced a splice variant
that is 159-bp shorter in the 3-prime untranslated region. The promoter
region was shown to be GC-rich and to contain a TATA box. The authors
demonstrated promoter activity in mouse epithelial cells for the 5-prime
flanking region when it was linked to the reporter gene alkaline
phosphatase.

MAPPING

By FISH, Kraus et al. (1994) mapped the CTNNB1 gene to 3p21, a region
frequently affected by somatic alterations in a variety of tumors. Using
PCR primers for the genomic amplification of beta-catenin sequences on
the basis of homology to exon 4 of the Drosophila armadillo gene, they
analyzed a panel of somatic cell hybrids to confirm the localization of
the gene to human chromosome 3. Exclusion mapping of 3 hybrids carrying
defined fragments of 3p allowed them to determine that the CTNNB1 locus
is close to marker D3S2. Guenet et al. (1995) mapped the homologous
gene, symbolized Catnb by them, to mouse chromosome 9 by analysis of
interspecific backcrosses. Bailey et al. (1995) used FISH and PCR
analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNAs to show that the CTNNB1 gene is
located in the 3p22-p21 region. By FISH, van Hengel et al. (1995)
assigned CTNNB1 to 3p22-p21.3. Trent et al. (1995) likewise localized
the CTNNB1 gene to 3p22 by FISH. They stated that because APC-binding
proteins (like beta-catenin) represent a 'downstream' modulator of APC
activity, the chromosomal locus of such a protein might be expected to
be a site involved in chromosome rearrangements in malignancy.

GENE FUNCTION

Work by Korinek et al. (1997) and by Morin et al. (1997) established
that the APC gene (611731), which is mutant in adenomatous polyposis of
the colon, is a negative regulator of beta-catenin signaling. The APC
protein normally binds to beta-catenin, which interacts with Tcf and Lef
transcription factors. Korinek et al. (1997) cloned a gene, which they
called hTcf-4, that is a Tcf family member expressed in colonic
epithelium. The protein product (Tcf4) transactivates transcription only
when associated with beta-catenin. Nuclei of APC -/- colon carcinoma
cells were found to contain a stable beta-catenin/Tcf4 complex that was
constitutively active, as measured by transcription of a Tcf reporter
gene. Reintroduction of APC removed beta-catenin from Tcf4 and abrogated
the transcriptional activation. Korinek et al. (1997) concluded that
constitutive transcription of Tcf target genes, caused by loss of APC
function, may be a crucial event in the early transformation of colonic
epithelium. Morin et al. (1997) likewise found that the protein products
of mutant APC genes present in colorectal tumors were defective in
downregulating transcriptional activation mediated by beta-catenin and
T-cell transcription factor-4 (TCF4), now known as transcription
factor-7-like-2 (TCF7L2; 602228). Furthermore, colorectal tumors with
intact APC genes were found to contain activating mutations of
beta-catenin that altered functionally significant phosphorylation
sites. These results indicated that regulation of beta-catenin is
critical to the tumor suppressive effect of APC and that this regulation
can be circumvented by mutations in either APC or beta-catenin.

Roose et al. (1999) demonstrated in mice that one of the targets of the
beta-catenin/TCF7L2 interactions in epithelial cells is TCF7 (189908).
Roose et al. (1999) suggested that TCF7 may act as a feedback repressor
of beta-catenin/TCF7L2 target genes, and thus may cooperate with APC to
suppress malignant transformation of epithelial cells.

Rodova et al. (2002) presented evidence for beta-catenin-induced
expression of PKD1 (601313). They analyzed the promoter region of PKD1
and identified numerous transactivating factors, including 4 TCF-binding
elements (TBEs). Beta-catenin induced a reporter construct containing
TBE1 6-fold when cotransfected into HEK293T cells, which express TCF4
(TCF7L2). Dominant-negative TCF4 or deletion of the TBE1 sequence
inhibited the induction. Gel shift assays confirmed that TCF4 and
beta-catenin could complex with the TBE1 site, and HeLa cells stably
transfected with beta-catenin responded with elevated levels of
endogenous PKD1 mRNA. Rodova et al. (2002) concluded that the PKD1 gene
is a target of the beta-catenin/TCF pathway.

Van de Wetering et al. (2002) showed that disruption of
beta-catenin/TCF4 activity in colorectal cancer cells induced a rapid G1
arrest and blocked a genetic program that was physiologically active in
the proliferative compartment of colon crypts. Coincidently, an
intestinal differentiation program was induced. The TCF4 target gene MYC
(190080) played a central role in this switch by direct repression of
the CDKN1A (116899) promoter. Following disruption of beta-catenin/TCF4
activity, the decreased expression of MYC released CDKN1A transcription,
which in turn mediated G1 arrest and differentiation. The authors
concluded that the beta-catenin/TCF4 complex constitutes the master
switch that controls proliferation versus differentiation in healthy and
malignant intestinal epithelial cells.

Glucuronic acid epimerase (GLCE; 612134) is responsible for
epimerization of D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) to L-iduronic acid (IdoA) of
the cell surface polysaccharide heparan sulfate (HS), endowing the
nascent HS polysaccharide chain with the ability to bind growth factors
and cytokines. Using stepwise deletion and site-directed mutagenesis,
Ghiselli and Agrawal (2005) identified 2 cis-acting binding elements for
the beta-catenin-TCF4 complex in the enhancer region of the GLCE
promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift analyses
confirmed binding of beta-catenin-TCF4 to these sequences of GLCE. GLCE
expression in human colon carcinoma cell lines correlated with the
degree of activation of the beta-catenin-TCF4 transactivation complex.
Furthermore, ectopic expression of beta-catenin-TCF4 increased the GLCE
transcript level and enhanced the rate of GlcA epimerization in HS.
Ghiselli and Agrawal (2005) concluded that the beta-catenin-TCF4
transactivation pathway plays a major role in modulating GLCE
expression, thus contributing to regulation of HS biosynthesis and its
structural organization.

Batlle et al. (2002) showed that beta-catenin and TCF inversely control
the expression of the EphB2 (600997)/EphB3 (601839) receptors and their
ligand, ephrin B1 (EFNB1; 300035), in colorectal cancer and along the
crypt-villus axis. Disruption of EphB2 and EphB3 genes revealed that
their gene products restrict cell intermingling and allocate cell
populations within the intestinal epithelium. In EphB2/EphB3 null mice,
the proliferative and differentiated populations intermingled. In adult
EphB3 -/- mice, Paneth cells did not follow their downward migratory
path, but scattered along crypt and villus. The authors concluded that,
in the intestinal epithelium, beta-catenin and TCF couple proliferation
and differentiation to the sorting of cell populations through the
EphB/ephrin B system.

Kawasaki et al. (2000) cloned a gene, ASEF (605216), whose protein
product interacts directly with APC (611731). ASEF immunoprecipitates
with beta-catenin; however, ASEF and beta-catenin do not interact
directly, suggesting that ASEF, APC, and beta-catenin are found in the
same complex in vivo. Kawasaki et al. (2000) suggested that the APC-ASEF
complex may regulate the actin cytoskeletal network, cell morphology and
migration, and neuronal function.

In addition to the inhibition of ubiquitination (see BTRC, 603482) of
phosphorylated IKBA (164008), Neish et al. (2000) observed that
phosphorylated CTNNB1 is not ubiquitinated in epithelial cells exposed
to avirulent Salmonella.

Eastman and Grosschedl (1999) reviewed progress in understanding of how
the activities of both beta-catenin and LEF1/TCF (153245) proteins are
regulated. They summarized the interactions of beta-catenin and LEF1/TCF
proteins, including a discussion of how cellular events can influence
the stability of beta-catenin and its availability for association with
LEF1/TCF proteins. Eastman and Grosschedl (1999) also discussed factors
that influence beta-catenin activity independent of a Wnt signal.

Kang et al. (2002) showed that presenilin-1 (PS1; 104311) functions as a
scaffold that rapidly couples beta-catenin phosphorylation through 2
sequential kinase activities independent of the Wnt-regulated axin
(603816)/CK1-alpha (600505) complex. Presenilin deficiency resulted in
increased beta-catenin stability in vitro and in vivo by disconnecting
the stepwise phosphorylation of beta-catenin, both in the presence and
absence of Wnt stimulation. These findings highlighted an aspect of
beta-catenin regulation outside of the canonical Wnt-regulated pathway
and a function of presenilin separate from intramembrane proteolysis.

Murase et al. (2002) transfected fluorescence-tagged chick beta-catenin
into rat hippocampal neurons in culture. They found that, upon
depolarization, beta-catenin moved from dendritic shafts into spines and
increased its association with cadherins. This redistribution of
beta-catenin was mimicked by addition of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and
prevented by addition of a phosphatase inhibitor. Transfection with a
chick beta-catenin carrying a phosphorylation-preventing mutation of
tyr654 (tyr654 to phe; Y654F) resulted in concentration of beta-catenin
within spines, whereas transfection with a phosphorylation-mimicking
mutation (tyr654 to glu; Y654E) resulted in beta-catenin accumulation in
dendritic shafts. The Y654F-expressing neurons also exhibited a higher
minifrequency and larger Psd95 (602887) and synapsin-1 (313440) clusters
within synaptic spines.

Tetsu and McCormick (1999) showed that beta-catenin activated
transcription from the cyclin D1 (CCND1; 168461) promoter. They
identified promoter sequences related to consensus TCF/LEF-binding sites
that were necessary for activation. p21 RAS (see 190020) further
activated transcription of the cyclin D1 gene through sites within the
promoter that bind the transcriptional regulators ETS (see 164720) or
CREB (CREB1; 123810). Cells expressing mutant beta-catenin produced high
levels of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein. Furthermore, expression of a
dominant-negative form of TCF in colon cancer cells inhibited expression
of cyclin D1 without affecting expression of other cyclins or
cyclin-dependent kinases and caused cells to arrest in G1.

Lin et al. (2000) demonstrated that CCND1 is one of the targets of
beta-catenin in breast cancer (114480) cells. They found that high
beta-catenin activity correlated with poor patient prognosis and was a
strong and independent prognostic factor in breast cancer. These studies
indicated that beta-catenin can be involved in breast cancer formation
and/or progression and may serve as a target for breast cancer therapy.

Van Aken et al. (2002) studied the cadherin-catenin complex in
retinoblastoma and normal retina tissues. In both cases, they found that
N-cadherin (114020) was associated with alpha- and beta-catenin but not
with E- or P-cadherin. Moreover, retinoblastoma cells, in contrast with
normal retina, expressed an N-cadherin/catenin complex that was
irregularly distributed and weakly linked to the cytoskeleton. In
retinoblastoma, this complex acted as an invasion promoter.

Widlund et al. (2002) identified beta-catenin as a significant regulator
of melanoma cell growth, with MITF (156845) as a critical downstream
target. Disruption of the canonical Wnt pathway abrogated growth of
melanoma cells, and constitutive overexpression of MITF rescued the
growth suppression.

The morphogenesis of organs as diverse as lungs, teeth, and hair
follicles is initiated by a downgrowth from a layer of epithelial stem
cells. During follicular morphogenesis, stem cells form this bud
structure by changing their polarity and cell-to-cell contact. Jamora et
al. (2003) showed that this process is achieved through simultaneous
receipt of 2 external signals: a WNT protein (WNT3A; 606359) to
stabilize beta-catenin, and a bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor
(Noggin; 602991) to produce Lef1. Beta-catenin then binds to and
activates Lef1 transcription complexes that appear to act
uncharacteristically by downregulating the gene encoding E-cadherin
(192090), an important component of polarity and intercellular adhesion.
When either signal is missing, functional Lef1 complexes are not made,
and E-cadherin downregulation and follicle morphogenesis are impaired.
In Drosophila, E-cadherin can influence the plane of cell division and
cytoskeletal dynamics. Consistent with this notion, Jamora et al. (2003)
showed that forced elevation of E-cadherin levels block invagination and
follicle production. Jamora et al. (2003) concluded that their findings
reveal an intricate molecular program that links 2 extracellular
signaling pathways to the formation of a nuclear transcription factor
that acts on target genes to remodel cellular junctions and permit
follicle formation.

Jarvinen et al. (2006) found that expression of a stabilized form of
beta-catenin in embryonic mouse oral and dental epithelium led to tooth
buds that gave rise to dozens of teeth. The molar crowns, however, were
typically simplified unicusped cones. Supernumerary teeth developed by a
renewal process where new signaling centers, the enamel knots, budded
off from the existing dental epithelium.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have the ability to renew themselves and
to give rise to all lineages of the blood. Reya et al. (2003) showed
that the WNT signaling pathway has an important role in this process.
Overexpression of activated beta-catenin expands the pool of HSCs in
long-term cultures by both phenotype and function. Furthermore, HSCs in
their normal microenvironment activate a LEF1/TCF reporter, which
indicates that HSCs respond to WNT signaling in vivo. To demonstrate the
physiologic significance of this pathway for HSC proliferation, Reya et
al. (2003) showed that the ectopic expression of axin or a frizzled
(603408) ligand-binding domain, inhibitors of the WNT signaling pathway,
led to inhibition of HSC growth in vitro and reduced reconstitution in
vivo. Furthermore, activation of WNT signaling in HSCs induced increased
expression of HOXB4 (142965) and NOTCH1 (190198), genes previously
implicated in self-renewal of HSCs. Reya et al. (2003) concluded that
the WNT signaling pathway is critical for normal HSC homeostasis in
vitro and in vivo, and provide insight into a potential molecular
hierarchy of regulation of HSC development.

In rat hippocampal neuronal cultures, Yu and Malenka (2003) found that
increasing the intracellular levels of beta-catenin enhanced dendritic
arborization. Although the effect did not require
WNT-beta-catenin-dependent transcription, WNT was involved in enhanced
dendritic arborization resulting from depolarization. Proteins that
sequestered beta-catenin decreased dendritic branch tip number and total
dendritic branch length. Yu and Malenka (2003) concluded that
beta-catenin is a mediator of dendritic development.

To test whether nuclear translocation of beta-catenin is involved in
axial identity and/or germ layer formation in 'pre-bilaterians,'
Wikramanayake et al. (2003) examined the in vivo distribution,
stability, and function of beta-catenin protein in embryos of the sea
anemone Nematostella vectensis. Wikramanayake et al. (2003) found that
N. vectensis beta-catenin is differentially stabilized along the
oral-aboral axis, translocated into nuclei in cells at the site of
gastrulation, and used to specify ectoderm, indicating an evolutionarily
ancient role for this protein in early pattern formation.

Lee et al. (2004) demonstrated that WNT/beta-catenin signal activation
in emigrating mouse neural crest stem cells had little effect on the
population size and instead regulated fate decisions. Sustained
beta-catenin activity in neural crest cells promoted the formation of
sensory neural cells in vivo at the expense of virtually all other
neural crest derivatives. Moreover, Lee et al. (2004) demonstrated that
WNT is able to instruct early neural crest stem cells to adopt a sensory
neuronal fate in a beta-catenin-dependent manner. Thus, Lee et al.
(2004) concluded that the role of WNT/beta-catenin in stem cells is
cell-type dependent.

Kleber et al. (2005) found that Bmp2 (112261) signaling antagonized the
sensory fate-inducing activity of Wnt/beta-catenin. Wnt and Bmp2 acted
synergistically to suppress differentiation and to maintain mouse neural
crest stem cell marker expression and multipotency.

Brembeck et al. (2004) found that BCL9-2 (BCL9L; 609004) was involved in
the switch between the adhesive and transcriptional functions of
beta-catenin. The switch was initiated by tyrosine phosphorylation of
beta-catenin, which favored BCL9-2 binding and precluded interaction
with alpha-catenin.

By coimmunoprecipitation and tandem mass spectrometric analysis, Tian et
al. (2004) found that 14-3-3-zeta is a beta-catenin-interacting protein.
14-3-3-zeta enhanced beta-catenin-dependent transcription by stabilizing
beta-catenin in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, 14-3-3-zeta facilitated
activation of beta-catenin by AKT (see AKT1; 164730) and colocalized
with activated Akt in mouse intestinal stem cells. Tian et al. (2004)
proposed that AKT phosphorylates beta-catenin, leading to 14-3-3-zeta
binding and stabilization of beta catenin.

Guo et al. (2004) found that several Wnt genes, including Wnt4 (603490),
Wnt14 (602863), and Wnt16 (606267), were expressed in overlapping and
complementary patterns in developing mouse synovial joints, where Ctnnb1
protein level and transcription activity were upregulated. Removal of
Ctnnb1 early in mesenchymal progenitor cells promoted chondrocyte
differentiation and blocked the activity of Wnt14 in joint formation.
Ectopic expression of an activated form of Ctnnb1 or Wnt14 in early
differentiating chondrocytes induced ectopic joint formation both
morphologically and molecularly. In contrast, genetic removal of Ctnnb1
in chondrocytes led to joint fusion. Guo et al. (2004) concluded that
the Wnt/CTNNB1 signaling pathway is necessary and sufficient to induce
early steps of synovial joint formation, and they suggested that WNT4,
WNT14, and WNT16 may play redundant roles in synovial joint induction by
signaling through the CTNNB1-mediated canonical Wnt pathway.

Kaplan et al. (2004) found that, in addition to its roles in cell-cell
adhesion and Wnt-stimulated transcriptional activation, beta-catenin has
a role in establishing bipolar mitotic spindles. During mitosis in mouse
fibroblasts and HeLa cells, beta-catenin relocalized to mitotic spindle
poles and to the midbody. Biochemical fractionation demonstrated the
presence of beta-catenin in purified centrosome preparations. Reduction
of beta-catenin by RNA interference led to failure of centrosomes to
fully separate, resulting in a marked increase in the frequency of
monoastral mitotic spindles.

Kim et al. (2005) reported that the downregulation of a metastasis
suppressor gene, KAI1 (600623), in prostate cancer cells involves the
inhibitory actions of beta-catenin, along with a reptin (TIP48; 604788)
chromatin remodeling complex. This inhibitory function of
beta-catenin-reptin requires both increased beta-catenin expression and
recruitment of histone deacetylase activity. The coordinated actions of
beta-catenin-reptin components that mediate the repressive state serve
to antagonize a TIP60 (601409) coactivator complex that is required for
activation; the balance of these opposing complexes controls the
expression of KAI1 and metastatic potential. Kim et al. (2005) concluded
that the molecular mechanisms underlying the antagonistic regulation of
beta-catenin-reptin and the TIP60 coactivator complexes for the
metastasis suppressor gene, KAI1, are likely to be prototypic of a
selective downregulation strategy for many genes, including a subset of
NF-kappa-B (see 164011) target genes.

Essers et al. (2005) reported an evolutionarily conserved interaction of
beta-catenin with FOXO transcription factors (e.g., 602681), which are
regulated by insulin and oxidative stress signaling. In mammalian cells,
beta-catenin binds directly to FOXO and enhances FOXO transcriptional
activity. In C. elegans, loss of the beta-catenin BAR1 reduces the
activity of the FOXO ortholog DAF16 in dauer formation and life span.
Association of beta-catenin with FOXO was enhanced in cells exposed to
oxidative stress. Furthermore, BAR1 was required for the oxidative
stress-induced expression of the DAF16 target gene sod3 and for
resistance to oxidative damage. Essers et al. (2005) concluded that
their results demonstrated a role for beta-catenin in regulating FOXO
function that is particularly important under conditions of oxidative
stress.

Shah et al. (2006) stated that the signaling and oncogenic activity of
beta-catenin can be repressed by activation of vitamin D receptor (VDR;
601769). Conversely, high levels of beta-catenin can potentiate the
transcriptional activity of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Shah et al. (2006)
showed that the effects of beta-catenin on VDR activity are due
interaction between the activator function-2 domain of VDR and the C
terminus of beta-catenin.

Noubissi et al. (2006) demonstrated that beta-catenin stabilizes the
mRNA encoding the F-box protein beta-TrCP1 (BTRCP1; 603482), and
identified the RNA-binding protein CRDBP (608288) as a target of beta
catenin/Tcf transcription factor. CRDBP binds to the coding region of
BTRCP1 mRNA. Overexpression of CRDBP stabilized BTRCP1 mRNA and elevated
BTRCP1 levels both in cells and in vivo, resulting in the activation of
the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein (SCF)-BTRCP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and in
accelerated turnover of its substrates including I-kappa-B (see 164008)
and beta-catenin. CRDBP is essential for the induction of both BTRCP1
and c-Myc (190080) by beta-catenin signaling in colorectal cancer cells.
Noubissi et al. (2006) concluded that high levels of CRDBP that are
found in primary human colorectal tumors exhibiting active
beta-catenin/Tcf signaling implicates CRDBP induction in the
upregulation of BTRCP1, in the activation of dimeric transcription
factor NF-kappa-B, and in the suppression of apoptosis in these cancers.

Parakh et al. (2006) found that expression of beta-catenin lacking the
N-terminal 90-amino acids that lead to its degradation significantly
enhanced follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH; see 136350)-mediated
induction of CYP19A1 (107910) and CYP11A1 (118485) mRNA. CYP19A1
transactivation by SF1 (NR5A1; 601516) required a functional interaction
with beta-catenin and an intact beta-catenin-binding site. The
beta-catenin-binding site was also critical for the synergistic actions
of FSH and SF1 on CYP19A1. The actions of beta-catenin on CYP19A1 were
dependent on hormone-induced cAMP cascades. Parakh et al. (2006)
concluded that beta-catenin is essential for FSH/cAMP-regulated gene
expression in ovary and that beta-catenin has a role in estrogen
biosynthesis.

Moore et al. (2008) showed that epitope-tagged mammalian Mtgr1 (CBFA2T2;
603672), Mtg8 (RUNX1T1; 133435), and Mtg16 (CBFA2T3; 603870) interacted
with human TCF4 in cotransfected COS-7 cells. Beta-catenin disrupted
interaction of Mtg proteins with TCF4. When expressed in Xenopus
embryos, Mtg family members inhibited Wnt-dependent axis formation and
impaired the ability of beta-catenin or Lef1 to induce axis duplication.
Furthermore, Myc was overexpressed in the small intestine of mice
lacking Mtgr1. Moore et al. (2008) concluded that MTG proteins act
downstream of beta-catenin in the Wnt signaling pathway.

Fungiform taste papillae form a regular array on the dorsal surface of
the tongue. Taste buds arise from papilla epithelium and, unusual for
epithelial derivatives, synapse with neurons, release neurotransmitters,
and generate receptor and action potentials. Liu et al. (2007)
demonstrated that Wnt-beta-catenin signaling is activated in developing
fungiform placodes and taste bud cells. They showed that a dominant
stabilizing mutation in epithelial beta-catenin causes massive
overproduction of enlarged fungiform papillae and taste buds. Likewise,
genetic deletion of epithelial beta-catenin or inhibition of
Wnt-beta-catenin signaling by ectopic dickkopf-1 (Dkk1; 605189) blocked
initiation of fungiform papilla morphogenesis. Ectopic papillae were
innervated in the stabilizing beta-catenin mutant, whereas ectopic Dkk1
caused absence of lingual epithelial innervation. Thus, Wnt-beta-catenin
signaling is critical for fungiform papilla and taste bud development.
Altered regulation of the pathway may underlie evolutionary changes in
taste papilla patterning.

Bahmanyar et al. (2008) found that stabilization of beta-catenin,
mimicking mutations found in cancer, induced centrosome splitting,
similar to ectopic NEK2 (604043) activation. They identified
beta-catenin as a substrate and binding partner for NEK2 in vitro and in
vivo and found that beta-catenin colocalized with the NEK2 substrates
rootletin (CROCC) and CNAP1 (CEP2; 609689) between centrosomes. CNAP1
and rootletin were required for localization of beta-catenin between
centrosomes in interphase, whereas beta-catenin had
rootletin-independent binding sites on chromosomes at mitotic spindle
poles. In response to ectopic expression of active NEK2 in interphase
cells, rootletin was reduced at interphase centrosomes and beta-catenin
localized to rootletin-independent sites on centrosomes, an event
required for centrosome separation in mitosis.

Continuous turnover of epithelia is ensured by the extensive
self-renewal capacity of tissue-specific stem cells. Similarly,
epithelial tumor maintenance relies on cancer stem cells, which co-opt
stem cell properties. In murine skin, follicular morphogenesis is driven
by bulge stem cells that specifically express CD34 (142230). Malanchi et
al. (2008) identified a population of cells in early epidermal tumors
characterized by phenotype and functional similarities to normal bulge
skin stem cells. This population contains cancer stem cells, which are
the only cells with tumor initiation properties. Transplants derived
from these cancer stem cells preserve the hierarchical organization of
the primary tumor. Malanchi et al. (2008) described beta-catenin
signaling as being essential in sustaining the cancer stem cell
phenotype. Ablation of the beta-catenin gene results in the loss of
cancer stem cells and complete tumor regression. In addition, Malanchi
et al. (2008) provided evidence for the involvement of increased
beta-catenin signaling in malignant human squamous cell carcinomas.
Malanchi et al. (2008) concluded that because Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
is not essential for normal epidermal homeostasis, such a mechanistic
difference may thus be targeted to eliminate cancer stem cells and
consequently eradicate squamous cell carcinomas.

To identify genes that both modulate beta-catenin activity and are
essential for colon cancer cell proliferation, Firestein et al. (2008)
conducted 2 loss-of-function screens in human colon cancer cells and
compared genes identified in these screens with an analysis of copy
number alterations in colon cancer specimens. One of these genes,
cyclin-dependent kinase-8 (CDK8; 603184), which encodes a member of the
mediator complex, is located at 13q12.13, a region of recurrent copy
number gain in a substantial fraction of colon cancers. Firestein et al.
(2008) showed that suppression of CDK8 expression inhibits proliferation
in colon cancer cells characterized by high levels of CDK8 and
beta-catenin hyperactivity. CDK8 kinase activity was necessary for
beta-catenin-driven transformation and for expression of several
beta-catenin transcriptional targets.

Morris et al. (2008) demonstrated that the transcription factor E2F1
(189971) is a potent and specific inhibitor of beta-catenin/T cell
factor (TCF)-dependent transcription and that this function contributes
to E2F1-induced apoptosis. E2F1 deregulation suppresses beta-catenin
activity in an APC (611731)/glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3; see
606784)-independent manner, reducing the expression of key beta-catenin
targets including c-MYC (190080). This interaction explains why
colorectal tumors, which depend on beta-catenin transcription for their
abnormal proliferation, keep RB1 (614041) intact. Remarkably, E2F1
activity is also repressed by CDK8, a colorectal oncoprotein. Elevated
levels of CDK8 protect beta-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription from
inhibition by E2F1. Morris et al. (2008) concluded that thus, by
retaining RB1 and amplifying CDK8, colorectal tumor cells select
conditions that collectively suppress E2F1 and enhance the activity of
beta-catenin.

Independently, Chassot et al. (2008) and Tomizuka et al. (2008) found
that knockout of Rspo1 (609595) in mice resulted in at least partial sex
reversal in females, but not males. Rspo1 was required for activation of
beta-catenin and Wnt4 signaling for female sex determination.

In familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), beta-catenin is stabilized
constitutively, providing a permanent mitogenic signal to normally
resting cells. This occurs when the second allele of APC (611731) is
inactivated somatically. Kohler et al. (2009) described an APC domain,
the beta-catenin inhibitory domain (CID), that is located between the
second and third 20-amino acid beta-catenin-binding repeats and
therefore was present in many truncated APC products found in human
tumors. In truncated APC, the CID was absolutely necessary to
downregulate the transcriptional activity and the level of beta-catenin,
even when an axin/conductin binding site was present. The activity of
the CID was dramatically reduced in several colon cancer cell lines and
could be inhibited by shorter truncated APC lacking the CID. The authors
concluded that CID is a direct target of the selective pressure acting
on APC during tumorigenesis, and it explains the interdependence of both
APC mutations in colorectal, duodenal, and desmoid tumors.

Huang et al. (2009) used a chemical genetic screen to identify a small
molecule, XAV939, which selectively inhibits beta-catenin-mediated
transcription. XAV939 stimulates beta-catenin degradation by stabilizing
axin (603816), the concentration-limiting component of the destruction
complex. Using a quantitative chemical proteomic approach, Huang et al.
(2009) found that XAV939 stabilizes axin by inhibiting the
poly-ADP-ribosylating enzymes tankyrase-1 (603303) and tankyrase-2
(607128). Both tankyrase isoforms interact with a highly conserved
domain of axin and stimulate its degradation through the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

Gattinoni et al. (2009) reported that induction of Wnt/beta-catenin
signaling by inhibitors of Gsk3b or by Wnt3a arrested mouse Cd8 (see
186910)-positive T-cell development into effector T cells capable of
cytotoxicity or Ifng (147570) production. Instead, Wnt signaling
promoted expression of Tcf7 and Lef1 and generation of self-renewing
multipotent Cd8-positive memory stem cells capable of proliferation and
antitumor activity. Gattinoni et al. (2009) concluded that Wnt signaling
has a key role in maintaining the self-renewing stem cell-like
properties of mature memory CD8-positive T cells.

Using RT-PCR and flow cytometric analysis, Zhao et al. (2010)
demonstrated that mouse Tcf7 and Lef1 were highly expressed in naive T
cells, downregulated in effector T cells, and upregulated in memory T
cells. Memory Cd8-positive T cells expressing the p45 Tcf7 isoform and
beta-catenin had enhanced Il2 (147680) production capacity and enhanced
effector capacity to clear Listeria monocytogenes. Zhao et al. (2010)
concluded that constitutive activation of the Wnt pathway favors memory
CD8 T-cell formation during immunization, resulting in enhanced immunity
upon a second encounter with the same pathogen.

Using a genetic approach, Driessens et al. (2010) found no evidence that
the beta-catenin pathway regulates T-cell memory phenotype, in contrast
with the findings of Gattinoni et al. (2009). The findings of Driessens
et al. (2010) suggested that the generation of Cd8-positive memory stem
cells observed by Gattinoni et al. (2009) with the use of Gsk3b
inhibitors was not a consequence of activation of the beta-catenin
pathway, but was rather due activation of another Gsk3b-dependent
pathway. In a reply, Gattinoni et al. (2010) noted that others,
including Zhao et al. (2010) and Jeannet et al. (2010), had also
identified Wnt and beta-catenin as crucial factors in postthymic
Cd8-positive T-cell differentiation and memory development. Using
Western blot analysis, Gattinoni et al. (2010) showed that addition of
Wnt3a or Gsk3b inhibitor stabilized beta-catenin in primed Cd8-positive
mouse T cells.

Manicassamy et al. (2010) reported that the Wnt-beta-catenin signaling
in intestinal dendritic cells regulates the balance between inflammatory
versus regulatory responses in the gut. Beta-catenin in intestinal
dendritic cells was required for the expression of antiinflammatory
mediators such as retinoic acid metabolizing enzymes, interleukin-10
(124092), and transforming growth factor-beta (190180), and the
stimulation of regulatory T cell induction while suppressing
inflammatory effector T cells. Furthermore, ablation of beta-catenin
expression in dendritic cells enhanced inflammatory responses and
disease in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. This,
Manicassamy et al. (2010) concluded that beta-catenin signaling programs
dendritic cells to a tolerogenic state, limiting the inflammatory
response. Murphy (2011) commented that the deletion of beta-catenin in
macrophages remains a caveat to the interpretation of Manicassamy et al.
(2010) that Wnt signaling programs dendritic cells into a tolerogenic
state. Development of strains expressing Cre in a more finely
lineage-restricted pattern is necessary to resolve this issue.
Manicassamy and Pulendran (2011) responded that beta-catenin-deficient
dendritic cells are greatly impaired in inducing regulatory T cells, and
induce enhanced TH17/TH1 responses. They agreed that assessing the
relative importance of dendritic cells versus macrophages in intestinal
tolerance awaits tools that permit the genetic deletion of the numerous
dendritic cell and macrophage subsets in the intestine.

Yang et al. (2011) demonstrated in human cancer cells that EGFR (131550)
activation induces translocation of PKM2, but not PKM1 (see 179050),
into the nucleus, where K433 of PKM2 binds to c-Src-phosphorylated Y333
of beta-catenin. This interaction is required for both proteins to be
recruited to the CCND1 (168461) promoter, leading to HDAC3 (605166)
removal from the promoter, histone H3 acetylation, and cyclin D1
expression. PKM2-dependent beta-catenin transactivation is instrumental
in EGFR-promoted tumor cell proliferation and brain tumor development.
In addition, positive correlations were identified between c-Src
activity, beta-catenin Y333 phosphorylation, and PKM2 nuclear
accumulation in human glioblastoma specimens. Furthermore, levels of
beta-catenin phosphorylation and nuclear PKM2 were correlated with
grades of glioma malignancy and prognosis. Yang et al. (2011) concluded
that their findings revealed that EGF induces beta-catenin
transactivation via a mechanism distinct from that induced by
Wnt/Wingless and highlighted the essential nonmetabolic functions of
PKM2 in EGFR-promoted beta-catenin transactivation, cell proliferation,
and tumorigenesis.

Hoffmeyer et al. (2012) reported a molecular link between
Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and the expression of the telomerase subunit
Tert (187270). Beta-catenin-deficient mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells
have short telomeres; conversely, ES cells expressing an activated form
of beta-catenin (beta-catenin(deltaEx3/+)) have long telomeres.
Hoffmeyer et al. (2012) showed that beta-catenin regulates Tert
expression through the interaction with Klf4 (602253), a core component
of the pluripotency transcriptional network. Beta-catenin binds to the
Tert promoter in a mouse intestinal tumor model and in human carcinoma
cells. Hoffmeyer et al. (2012) uncovered a theretofore unknown link
between the stem cell and oncogenic potential whereby beta-catenin
regulates Tert expression, and thereby telomere length, which could be
critical in human regenerative therapy and cancer.

In mice, Takeo et al. (2013) showed that nail stem cells (NSCs) reside
in the proximal nail matrix and are defined by high expression of
keratin-14 (148066), keratin-17 (148069), and KI67 (MKI67; 176741). The
mechanisms governing NSC differentiation are coupled directly to their
ability to orchestrate digit regeneration. Early nail progenitors
undergo Wnt (see 164820)-dependent differentiation into the nail. After
amputation, this Wnt activation is required for nail regeneration and
also for attracting nerves that promote mesenchymal blastema growth,
leading to the regeneration of the digit. Amputations proximal to the
Wnt-active nail progenitors result in failure to regenerate the nail or
digit. Nevertheless, beta-catenin stabilization in the NSC region
induced their regeneration. Takeo et al. (2013) concluded that their
results established a link between nail stem cell differentiation and
digit regeneration, and suggested that NSCs may have the potential to
contribute to the development of novel treatments for amputees.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

In adherens junctions, alpha-catenin links the cadherin/beta-catenin
complex to the actin-based cytoskeleton. Alpha-catenin is a homodimer in
solution, but forms a 1:1 heterodimer with beta-catenin. Pokutta and
Weis (2000) determined the crystal structure of the alpha-catenin
dimerization domain, residues 82 to 279. The crystal structure showed
that alpha-catenin dimerizes through formation of a 4-helix bundle in
which 2 antiparallel helices are contributed by each protomer. A
slightly larger fragment, containing residues 57 to 264, binds to
beta-catenin. The crystal structure of a chimera consisting of the
alpha-catenin-binding region of beta-catenin linked to the N terminus of
alpha-catenin residues 57 to 264 revealed the interaction between alpha-
and beta-catenin and provided a basis for understanding adherens
junction assembly.

Graham et al. (2002) determined the crystal structure at 2.5-angstrom
resolution of a complex between CTNNB1 and ICAT (607758), a protein that
prevents interaction between CTNNB1 and TCF/LEF family transcription
factors. ICAT contains a 3-helix bundle that binds armadillo repeats 10
to 12 and a C-terminal tail that, like TCF and E-cadherin, binds in the
groove formed by armadillo repeats 5 to 9 of CTNNB1. Graham et al.
(2002) showed that ICAT selectively inhibits CTNNB1/TCF binding in vivo,
without disrupting CTNNB1/cadherin interactions. They concluded that it
should be possible to design cancer therapeutics that inhibit
CTNNB1-mediated transcriptional activation without interfering with cell
adhesion.

Daniels and Weis (2002) determined the crystal structure of ICAT bound
to the armadillo repeat domain of CTNNB1. ICAT contains an N-terminal
helical domain that binds to repeats 11 and 12 of CTNNB1, and an
extended C-terminal region that binds to repeats 5 to 10 in a manner
similar to that of TCFs and other CTNNB1 ligands.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Mental Retardation, Autosomal Dominant 19

In 3 patients with severe intellectual disability, microcephaly, and
spasticity, de Ligt et al. (2012) identified heterozygous
loss-of-function mutations in the CTNNB1 gene (116806.0017-116806.0019).
Two of the mutations were known to be de novo; in the third patient, the
mutation was not inherited from the mother and the father's DNA was not
available for testing.

- Somatic Mutations

Morin et al. (1997) found a total of 3 tumors that contained CTNNB1
mutations that altered potential phosphorylation sites. Each mutation
was somatic and appeared to affect only 1 of the 2 CTNNB1 alleles.
Causative mutations were heterozygous. The authors hypothesized that the
mutations might exert a dominant effect, rendering a fraction of
cellular beta-catenin insensitive to APC-mediated downregulation. Thus,
disruption of APC-mediated regulation of beta-catenin/TCF-regulated
transcription is critical for colorectal tumorigenesis. This is most
commonly achieved by recessive inactivating mutations of both APC
alleles, but can also be achieved by dominant mutations of CTNNB1 that
render CRT insensitive to the effects of wildtype APC.

Ilyas et al. (1997) found 5 different mutations in 21 colorectal cancer
cell lines (26%) from 19 patients: a 3-bp deletion from codon 45 and
single-nucleotide missense mutations involving codons 33, 183, 245, and
287. All 23 cell lines studied had full-length beta-catenin protein that
was detectable by Western blotting and that coprecipitated with
E-cadherin. In 3 of the cell lines with CTNNB1 mutations, complexes of
beta-catenin with alpha-catenin and APC were detectable; in 2 other cell
lines, complexes were not detected.

Rubinfeld et al. (1997) detected abnormally high amounts of beta-catenin
in 7 of 26 human melanoma cell lines. Unusual messenger RNA splicing and
missense mutations in the CTNNB1 gene that result in stabilization of
the protein were identified in 6 of the 7 lines, and the APC gene was
altered or missing in 2 others. In the APC-deficient cells, ectopic
expression of wildtype APC eliminated the excess beta-catenin. Cells
with stabilized beta-catenin contained a constitutive beta-catenin/Lef1
complex. Thus, Rubinfeld et al. (1997) concluded that genetic defects
that result in upregulation of beta-catenin may play a role in melanoma
progression.

In a review of hereditary cancer syndromes, Fearon (1997) presented a
useful diagram illustrating how the APC protein regulates beta-catenin
levels in normal cells and how mutations in APC and CTNNB in cancer cell
genes deregulate cell growth via T-cell transcription factor-7-like-2.

Chan et al. (1999) studied 16 human pilomatricomas (132600) and found
CTNNB1 mutations in 12 of them. The mutations occurred in the
amino-terminal segment, normally involved in phosphorylation-dependent,
ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and thus are beta-catenin-stabilizing
mutations. The authors concluded that the 75% mutation rate directly
implicates beta-catenin/LEF misregulation as the major cause of hair
matrix cell tumorigenesis in humans.

Sagae et al. (1999) analyzed 61 primary ovarian carcinomas (167000),
consisting of 49 nonendometrioid-type tumors and 12 endometrioid tumors,
for genetic alteration of the CTNNB1 gene. In 5 carcinomas, including 4
(33%) of the endometrioid-type tumors and 1 (14%) of 7 mucinous-type
tumors, they found 3 somatic CTNNB1 mutations (see, e.g., 116806.0012).
All of the mutations caused alterations at the serine/threonine residues
that are potential sites of phosphorylation of GSK3-beta (GSK3B;
605004). Immunohistochemical studies were performed in 27 of the 61
ovarian carcinomas. Expression of both nuclear and cytoplasmic
beta-catenin was demonstrated in 4 of these 27 ovarian carcinomas for
which tissue samples were available for examination. Sagae et al. (1999)
concluded that the CTNNB1 mutations at potential GSK3B phosphorylation
sites result in accumulation of beta-catenin protein within cells and
its translocation to nuclei.

Wright et al. (1999) identified somatic mutations within exon 3 of the
CTNNB1 gene in 10 of 63 (16%) endometrioid ovarian carcinomas. The
mutations all resulted in missense changes within the GSK3-beta
consensus site.

Hepatoblastoma, a rare malignant tumor of the liver that occurs in
children at an average age of 2 to 3 years, represents the most frequent
malignant liver tumor in childhood. Although most cases are sporadic,
the incidence is highly elevated in patients with familial APC. These
patients carry germline mutations of the APC gene, which controls the
degradation of the CTNNB1 gene product after its NH2-terminal
phosphorylation on serine/threonine residues. APC, as well as CTNNB1, is
a central effector of the growth-promoting 'wingless' signaling pathway
in development. To determine whether this pathway is involved in the
pathogenesis of sporadic hepatoblastomas, Koch et al. (1999) examined 52
biopsies and 3 cell lines from sporadic hepatoblastomas for mutations in
the APC and CTNNB1 genes. In 48% of sporadic hepatoblastomas they found
CTNNB1 mutations (116806.0003-116806.0005). The mutations affected exon
3, which encodes the degradation targeting box of CTNNB1, and led to
accumulation of intracytoplasmic and nuclear beta-catenin protein. In
all, 11 point mutations and 5 small interstitial deletions of 24 to 102
bp were found. Eight point mutations abolished serine or threonine
phosphorylation sites. An increased transcriptional activity was
demonstrated in vitro for CTNNB1 forms carrying similar mutations in
exon 3.

A major function of APC is the downregulation of beta-catenin, a
transcription-activating protein with oncogenic potential. Molecular
genetic studies suggest that inactivation of the APC tumor suppressor
may be involved in hepatoblastoma tumorigenesis. In an ongoing
immunohistochemical study of beta-catenin expression in sporadic cases
of tumor types that are associated with adenomatous polyposis coli,
Blaker et al. (1999) observed increased beta-catenin levels in the
cytoplasm and in the nuclei of 3 hepatoblastomas. Sequencing of exon 3
of the CTNNB1 gene revealed an activating mutation in one of the tumor
samples (116806.0003). Thus, beta-catenin accumulation may play a role
in the development of hepatoblastoma and heterozygous activating
mutations of the CTNNB1 gene may substitute for biallelic APC
inactivation in this tumor type.

Legoix et al. (1999) found an activating beta-catenin mutation in exon 3
in 18% of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. Among tumors lacking a
beta-catenin mutation, no APC mutation had been detected in a subset of
30 cases tested. The correlation between beta-catenin mutation status
and chromosome segment deletions was studied on a set of 48 hyperploid
tumors. Chromosome 1p, 4q, and 16p deletions were significantly
associated with the absence of beta-catenin mutation. The results
suggested the existence of 2 mechanisms of carcinogenesis: first, a
beta-catenin activating mutation associated with a low rate of loss of
heterozygosity; a second, operating in a context of chromosomal
instability, would involve tumor suppressor genes.

Huang et al. (2000) screened 46 sporadic medulloblastomas for the
presence of mutations in genes of the Wnt signaling pathway (APC and
beta-catenin). Four tumors were found to have miscoding beta-catenin
mutations, 3 of which were located at codon 33 (ser33 to phe;
116806.0007).

In desmoid tumor tissue (see 135290), Shitoh et al. (1999) identified a
somatic thr41-to-ala mutation (116806.0003) in the beta-catenin gene.

Among 166 lung cancers (90 primary tumors and 76 cell lines), 1
blastoma, and 10 malignant mesotheliomas (156240) (2 primary tumors and
8 cell lines), Shigemitsu et al. (2001) identified 4 alterations in exon
3 of the CTNNB1 gene. Among 10 malignant mesotheliomas, they identified
in 1 cell line a homozygous deletion of the entire gene except for exon
1.

Wheeler et al. (2002) examined the possible contribution of beta-catenin
to sporadic small intestinal adenocarcinoma. Beta-catenin protein
expression was assessed immunohistochemically in a total of 21
nonfamilial, nonampullary small intestinal adenocarcinomas. Ten (48%)
showed decreased expression at the cell membrane and increased nuclear
staining; this contrasted with the usual pattern of protein expression
in normal colonic epithelium, where nuclear expression is undetectable
using immunohistochemical techniques. The authors also screened the
mutation cluster region of the APC gene and found no mutations, leading
them to suggest that increased nuclear localization of beta-catenin may
reflect gain-of-function mutation, similar to that seen in up to 25% of
colorectal cancers (Ilyas et al., 1997).

As noted, inactivating mutations of the APC gene or activating mutations
of the CTNNB1 gene initiate colorectal neoplasia. To address the
biochemical and physiologic effects of mutant beta-catenin, Chan et al.
(2002) disrupted either the mutant or wildtype CTNNB1 allele in a human
colorectal cancer cell line. Cells with only wildtype beta-catenin had
decreased colony-forming ability when plated at low density, although
their growth was similar to that of parental cells when passaged under
routine conditions. Immunohistochemistry and cell-fractionation studies
suggested that mutant beta-catenin activity was distinguished primarily
by cellular localization and not by protein degradation. Unexpectedly,
they found that mutant beta-catenin bound less well to E-cadherin (CDH1;
192090) than did wildtype beta-catenin, and the membranous localization
of wildtype and mutant beta-catenin was accordingly distinct. These
findings were considered to pose serious challenges to the current
models of APC/beta-catenin function.

Moreno-Bueno et al. (2001) analyzed the expression pattern of
beta-catenin in normal anagen hair follicles and in 40 human
pilomatrixomas by immunohistochemistry. In 11 of these tumors they also
studied exon 3 beta-catenin gene mutations by PCR and direct sequencing.
As these mutations have been related to a replication error (RER)
phenotype in other tumor types, Moreno-Bueno et al. (2001) explored
whether or not this association also occurs in pilomatrixomas.
Beta-catenin was expressed in the cell membranes of the outer and inner
root sheaths and in matrix cells located at the base and periphery of
the hair follicle bulb. However, central matrix cells that differentiate
into cortical cells, cortical, and cuticular cells expressed
beta-catenin in the nucleus, suggesting a role in signal transduction.
In addition, some fibroblasts of the dermal papilla also showed nuclear
expression of beta-catenin. All 40 analyzed pilomatrixomas showed
intense nuclear and cytoplasmic beta-catenin expression in proliferating
matrix (basaloid) cells. In areas of maturation, transitional cells
mainly showed cytoplasmic and membranous expression of beta-catenin,
while only a few cells retained nuclear expression. Shadow or ghost
cells did not show beta-catenin expression. Three of 11 tumors (26%) had
beta-catenin mutations. All 3 had the same heterozygous missense
mutation: a G-to-T change affecting the first nucleotide at codon 32
(116806.0016). None of the 11 tumors studied had a positive RER
phenotype. Moreno-Bueno et al. (2001) concluded that the
Wnt/Ctnnb1/Tcf-Lef pathway is activated in normal matrix cells of the
hair follicle to induce differentiation to the hair shaft. Additionally,
the beta-catenin mutation in matrix cells of the hair follicle
stabilizes beta-catenin protein, which translocates into the nucleus,
where it activates gene transcription together with lymphoid enhancer
factor-1 (153245)-producing pilomatrixoma. These mutations occur without
an underlying defect in DNA mismatch repair.

ANIMAL MODEL

An effector of intercellular adhesion, beta-catenin also functions in
Wnt signaling, associating with Lef1/Tcf DNA-binding proteins to form a
transcription factor. Gat et al. (1998) reported that this pathway also
operates in keratinocytes and that mice expressing beta-catenin
controlled by an epidermal promoter undergo a process resembling de novo
hair morphogenesis. The new follicles form sebaceous glands and dermal
papilla, normally established only in embryogenesis. As in
embryologically initiated hair germs, transgenic follicles induce Lef1,
but follicles are disoriented and defective in Sonic hedgehog
polarization. Additionally, proliferation continues unchecked, resulting
in 2 types of tumors (epithelioid cysts and trichofolliculomas) that are
also found in humans. Older transgenic mice develop pilomatricomas.
These findings suggested that transient beta-catenin stabilization may
be a key player in the epidermal signal leading to hair development and
implicated aberrant beta-catenin activation in hair tumors.

Harada et al. (1999) found that targeted deletion of exon 3 in mice,
which encodes serines and threonines phosphorylated by GSK3-beta, caused
adenomatous intestinal polyps resembling those in Apc knockout mice.
Some nascent microadenomas were also found in the colon.

To study the role of beta-catenin in skin development, Huelsken et al.
(2001) introduced a conditional mutation of the gene in the epidermis
and hair follicles of mice using Cre/loxP technology. When beta-catenin
was mutated during embryogenesis, formation of placodes that generate
hair follicles was blocked. The authors showed that beta-catenin is
required genetically downstream of Tabby (300450) and downless (EDAR;
604095) and upstream of bone morphogenetic proteins (see 112262) and Shh
(600725) in placode formation. If beta-catenin was deleted after hair
follicles had formed, hair was completely lost after the first hair
cycle. Further analysis demonstrated that beta-catenin is essential for
fate decisions of skin stem cells: in the absence of beta-catenin, stem
cells failed to differentiate into follicular keratinocytes and instead
adopted an epidermal fate.

Saadi-Kheddouci et al. (2001) found that transgenic mice that
overproduced an oncogenic form of beta-catenin in the epithelial cells
of the kidney developed severe polycystic lesions soon after birth.

To examine whether activating beta-catenin signaling could regulate
mammalian brain development, Chenn and Walsh (2002) developed transgenic
mice overexpressing an amino-terminal truncated form of beta-catenin
fused at the carboxyl-terminal with green fluorescent protein in
neuroepithelial precursors. The mice developed enlarged brains with
increased cerebral cortical surface area and folds resembling sulci and
gyri of higher mammals. Brains from transgenic animals have enlarged
lateral ventricles lined with neuroepithelial precursor cells,
reflecting an expansion of the precursor population. Compared with
wildtype precursors, a greater proportion of transgenic precursors
reenter the cell cycle after mitosis. Chenn and Walsh (2002) concluded
that their results showed that beta-catenin can function in the decision
of precursors to proliferate or differentiate during mammalian neuronal
development and suggested that beta-catenin can regulate cerebral
cortical size by controlling the generation of neuronal precursor cells.

Lickert et al. (2002) conditionally inactivated the beta-catenin gene in
cells of structures that exhibit organizer functions in mouse embryos:
the visceral endoderm, the node, the notochord, and the definitive
endoderm. Mesoderm formation was not affected in mutant embryos, but the
node was missing, patterning of the head and trunk was affected, and no
notochord or somites were formed. Deletion of beta-catenin in the
definitive endoderm led to the formation of multiple hearts along the
anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. Ectopic hearts developed in
parallel with the normal heart in regions of ectopic Bmp2 expression.
Lickert et al. (2002) concluded that ablation of beta-catenin in
embryonic endoderm changes cell fate from endoderm to precardiac
mesoderm.

By conditional gene ablation in mice, Soshnikova et al. (2003) found
that Wnt signaling is a key regulator of formation of the apical
ectodermal ridge (AER) and the dorsal-ventral axis of the limbs. They
generated compound mutants and showed that beta-catenin acts downstream
of BMP receptor-1A (BMPR1A; 601299) in AER induction, but upstream or
parallel in dorsal-ventral patterning. Soshnikova et al. (2003)
concluded that AER formation and dorsal-ventral patterning of limbs is
tightly controlled by Wnt/beta-catenin and BMP receptor signaling.

In mice bred to have T cells lacking Ctnnb1, Xu et al. (2003) observed a
substantial reduction in the number of splenic T cells. Splenic T cells
from these mice responded poorly to T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation
but showed no signs of enhanced cell death. Analysis of thymic
development suggested that Ctnnb1 deletion affected pre-TCR signaling in
double-negative thymocytes and impaired T-cell development at the level
of the beta selection checkpoint.

Day et al. (2005) found that ectopic canonical Wnt signaling led to
enhanced ossification and suppression of chondrocyte formation in mice.
Conversely, genetic inactivation of beta-catenin caused ectopic
formation of chondrocytes at the expense of osteoblast differentiation
during both intramembranous and endochondral ossification.

By conditional deletion of beta-catenin in mouse limb and head
mesenchyme, Hill et al. (2005) found that beta-catenin was required for
osteoblast lineage differentiation. Osteoblast precursors lacking
beta-catenin were blocked in differentiation and developed into
chondrocytes. Further experiments showed that beta-catenin activity was
necessary and sufficient to repress the differentiation of mesenchymal
cells into skeletal precursors.

Glass et al. (2005) engineered mice harboring either gain-of-function or
loss-of-function beta-catenin mutations targeted to osteoblasts. These
mice developed high and low bone mass phenotypes, respectively, caused
primarily by modification of bone resorption. Molecular analysis
revealed that canonical Wnt signaling controlled this process by
regulating expression of Opg (TNFRSF11B; 602643) within osteoblasts.
Glass et al. (2005) concluded that canonical Wnt signaling in
osteoblasts is a major negative regulator of bone resorption.

Using a gerbil model of gastritis and gastric cancer, Franco et al.
(2005) showed that in vivo adaptation of Helicobacter pylori by multiple
passages allowed a more rapid and reproducible induction of gastric
dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. The oncogenic H. pylori strain selectively
activated Ctnnb in gastric epithelia in a manner dependent on
translocation of bacterial CagA into host epithelial cells. Ctnnb
nuclear accumulation was increased in gastric epithelium from gerbils
infected with the carcinogenic H. pylori strain, as well as in persons
carrying Cag-positive versus Cag-negative bacterial strains or
uninfected persons. Franco et al. (2005) proposed that H. pylori-induced
dysregulation of CTNNB may explain, at least in part, the augmented risk
of gastric cancer after infection with this pathogen.

Zamora et al. (2007) found that conditional deletion of beta-catenin in
mouse proepicardium led to impaired formation of coronary arteries,
whereas the venous system and microvasculature of mutant mice were
normal. Mutant mice exhibited impaired epicardial development, including
failed expansion of the subepicardial space, blunted invasion of the
myocardium, and impaired differentiation of epicardium-derived
mesenchymal cells into coronary smooth muscle cells.

After amputation, freshwater planarians properly regenerate a head or
tail from the resulting anterior or posterior wound. Gurley et al.
(2008) found that in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea, RNA
interference (RNAi) of beta-catenin or dishevelled (601365) causes the
inappropriate regeneration of a head instead of a tail at posterior
amputations. Conversely, RNAi of the beta-catenin antagonist adenomatous
polyposis coli (APC; 611731) results in the regeneration of a tail at
anterior wounds. In addition, the silencing of beta-catenin is
sufficient to transform the tail of uncut adult animals into a head.
Gurley et al. (2008) suggested that beta-catenin functions as a
molecular switch to specify and maintain anteroposterior identity during
regeneration and homeostasis in planarians.

Petersen and Reddien (2008) independently performed experiments similar
to those described by Gurley et al. (2008) and identified a single gene,
which they called Smed-beta-catenin, that defines the character of the
anterioposterior axis throughout the Bilateria and specifies
regeneration polarity in planarians.

Liu et al. (2009) ablated beta-catenin specifically in the Sf1 (NR5A1;
601516)-positive population of mouse somatic cells and showed that
beta-catenin was present in gonads of both sexes but was necessary only
for ovarian differentiation but dispensable for testis development. Loss
of beta-catenin in fetal testes did not affect Sertoli cell
differentiation, testis morphogenesis, or masculinization of the
embryos. However, there were molecular and morphologic defects in
ovaries lacking beta-catenin, including formation of testis-specific
coelomic vessel, appearance of androgen-producing adrenal-like cells,
and loss of female germ cells. These phenotypes were strikingly similar
to those found in the Rspo1 (609595)- and Wnt4 (603490)-knockout
ovaries. In the absence of beta-catenin, expression of Wnt4 was
downregulated, while that of Rspo1 was not affected, placing
beta-catenin as a component in between Rspo1 and Wnt4.

Adrenocortical carcinoma (ADCC; 202300) is a rare but aggressive cancer.
Constitutive activation of beta-catenin is the most frequent alteration
in benign and malignant adrenocortical tumors in humans. Berthon et al.
(2010) showed that constitutive activation of beta-catenin in the
adrenal cortex of transgenic mice resulted in progressive steroidogenic
and undifferentiated spindle-shaped cell hyperplasia as well as
dysplasia of the cortex and medulla. Over 17 months, transgenic adrenals
developed malignant characteristics such as uncontrolled
neovascularization and loco-regional metastatic invasion. These
oncogenic events were accompanied by ectopic differentiation of
glomerulosa at the expense of fasciculata cells, which caused primary
hyperaldosteronism. Berthon et al. (2010) concluded that constitutively
active beta-catenin is an adrenal oncogene, which may trigger benign
aldosterone-secreting tumor development and promote malignancy.

COLORECTAL CANCER, SOMATIC
CTNNB1, 3-BP DEL, SER45DEL

In 2 colorectal cancer (see 114500) cell lines that expressed
full-length APC, yet had escaped inhibition of transcriptional
activation mediated by beta-catenin and TCF7L2, Morin et al. (1997)
found a mutation in a downstream component of the APC tumor suppressor
pathway, namely in the CTNNB1 gene. Each tumor line had a different
mutation: a 3-bp deletion that removed an amino acid (ser45) in one and
a C-to-A missense mutation that changed ser33 to tyr (116806.0002) in
the other. Analysis of paraffin-embedded archival tissue from the first
patient confirmed the somatic nature of this mutation and its presence
in the primary tumor before culture. Both mutations affected serines
that have been implicated in the downregulation of beta-catenin through
phosphorylation.

lines was a ser33-to-tyr mutation due to a C-to-A transversion in exon 3
of the CTNNB1 gene. The mutation was present in heterozygous form.

thr41-to-ala (T41A) substitution. (Iwao et al. (1998) described codon 41
mutations in sporadic colorectal carcinomas.) The ages of the patients
with the T41A mutation and hepatoblastoma ranged from 4 to 27 months.

In a hepatoblastoma, Blaker et al. (1999) demonstrated intense
cytoplasmic beta-catenin staining compared to adjacent normal liver
tissue and accumulation of beta-catenin in the tumor cell nuclei.
Furthermore, the tumor in one case was found to be heterozygous for an
A-to-G transition converting codon 41 from ACC (thr) to GCC (ala).
Legoix et al. (1999) found this same mutation in 3 cases of
hepatocellular carcinoma. Rather than being childhood cases, these were
adults (mean age 58 years; range, 27 to 76 years). In the group of 98
cases, many of the subjects were alcoholics.

609837	TITLE *609837 SMALL NUCLEOLAR RNA, C/D BOX, 115-1; SNORD115-1
;;RNA, HBII-52 SMALL NUCLEOLAR;;
snoRNA, HBII-52;;
MBII-52, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for small non-mRNAs specifically expressed in mouse brain,
followed by searching human sequence databases, Cavaille et al. (2000)
identified SNORD115, which they called HBII-52. HBII-52 is a C/D box
small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) with a 5-prime C box, followed by a D-prime
box, a C-prime box, an antisense box, and a 3-prime D box. Northern blot
analysis detected expression of HBII-52 in human brain, but not in
liver, muscle, lung, kidney, and heart. Cavaille et al. (2000)
determined that HBII-52 maps to an imprinted region of chromosome 15
associated with Angelman syndrome (AS; 105830) and Prader-Willi syndrome
(PWS; 176270). They concluded that HBII-52 is a paternally imprinted
gene, since it was expressed in cortex RNA from a normal control brain
and from an AS patient with a maternally inherited deletion, but was
absent from cortex RNA from a PWS patient with a paternally inherited
deletion and from a mouse model of PWS.

GENE FUNCTION

Cavaille et al. (2000) identified an 18-nucleotide phylogenetically
conserved region in HBII-52 complementary to a critical segment of the
serotonin-2C receptor mRNA (HTR2C; 312861), suggesting that HBII-52 may
have a role in processing HTR2C mRNA.

The snoRNA HBII-52 is contained within the Prader-Willi deleted region
on chromosome 15q11 and exhibits sequence complementarity to the
alternatively spliced exon Vb of the serotonin receptor HTR2C. Kishore
and Stamm (2006) found that HBII-52 regulates alternative splicing of
HTR2C by binding to a silencing element in exon Vb. Prader-Willi
syndrome patients do not express HBII-52. They have different HTR2C mRNA
isoforms than healthy individuals. Kishore and Stamm (2006) concluded
that a snoRNA regulates the processing of an mRNA expressed from a gene
located on a different chromosome, and the results indicate that a
defect in pre-mRNA processing contributes to the Prader-Willi syndrome.

Using bioinformatic predictions and experimental verification, Kishore
et al. (2010) identified 5 pre-mRNAs (DPM2, 603564; TAF1, 313650;
RALGPS1, 614444; PBRM1, 606083; and CRHR1, 122561) containing
alternative exons that are regulated by MBII-52, the mouse homolog of
HBII-52. Analysis of a single member of the MBII-52 cluster of snoRNAs
by RNase protection and Northern blot analysis showed that the MBII-52
expressing unit generated shorter RNAs that originate from the
full-length MBII-52 snoRNA through additional processing steps. These
novel RNAs associated with hnRNPs and not with proteins associated with
canonical C/D box snoRNAs. Kishore et al. (2010) concluded that not a
traditional C/D box snoRNA MBII-52, but a processed version lacking the
snoRNA stem, is the predominant MBII-52 RNA missing in Prader-Willi
syndrome. This processed snoRNA functions in alternative splice site
selection.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Cavaille et al. (2000) identified 47
tandem copies of the SNORD115 gene on chromosome 15q11-q13. The SNORD115
copies are slightly divergent units of about 1.9 kb regularly spaced
within a stretch of 99 kb.

Runte et al. (2001) determined that HBII-52 and several other snoRNAs
are encoded within intronic segments of the SNURF-SNRPN (182279)
transcript. HBII-52 is located within introns between exons 63 and 144
of SNURF-SNRPN.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Runte et al. (2005) found that individuals with complete deletion of all
copies of HBII-52 had no obvious clinical phenotype, suggesting that
HBII-52 does not play a major role in PWS.

Sato et al. (2007) reported a Japanese family in which a boy with AS and
his asymptomatic mother and maternal grandfather all had a 1,487-kb
deletion on chromosome 15, encompassing HBII-52. The mother was
evaluated with regard to diagnostic criteria for PWS but the diagnosis
was considered unlikely, suggesting that HBII-52 may not be important in
the pathogenesis of PWS.

ANIMAL MODEL

In a mouse model for PWS lacking expression of Mbii-52, Doe et al.
(2009) showed an increase in editing, but not alternative splicing, of
the Htr2c pre-RNA. This change in posttranscriptional modification was
associated with alterations in a number of brain serotonin-related
behaviors, including impulsive responding, locomotor activity and
reactivity to palatable foodstuffs. For marble burying, a behavior not
related to brain serotonin, loss of Mbii-52 was without effect. The
specificity of the behavioral effects to changes in Htr2c function was
further confirmed using drug challenges. These data illustrated the
physiologic consequences of altered RNA editing of Htr2c linked to
Mbii-52 loss that may underlie specific aspects of the complex PWS
phenotype and point to an important functional role for this imprinted
snoRNA.

609317	TITLE *609317 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 36; TRIM36
;;RBCC728
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a B-box domain consensus sequence to screen EST databases for
novel TRIM family members, Reymond et al. (2001) identified and cloned
mouse and human TRIM36. The deduced protein contains an N-terminal RING
domain, B-box-1 and B-box-2 domains, and a coiled-coil region.

By sequencing a region of chromosome 5 duplicated in a renal cell
carcinoma, Balint et al. (2004) identified TRIM36, which they designated
RBCC728. They obtained the full-length cDNA by PCR of fetal brain and
adult kidney cDNA libraries. The deduced 728-amino acid protein has an
N-terminal RING finger C3HC4 structure, 2 B-boxes, a coiled-coil region,
a fibronectin type III (see 135600) domain and a C-terminal domain found
in SPRY proteins (see SPRY1; 602465). TRIM36 also contains a bipartite
nuclear localization signal. TRIM36 shares 26% amino acid identity with
MID1 (300552). Quantitative RT-PCR detected highest TRIM36 expression in
testis, followed by prostate and brain, with weak expression in kidney,
lung, and heart. TRIM36 expression was upregulated in some prostate
cancers compared with normal tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis of
recombinant and endogenous TRIM36 in COS-7 cells showed the protein
expressed in a slightly filamentous staining pattern in the cytoplasm.
TRIM36 often accumulated near sites of cell-cell contact, and mitotic
cells were negative for TRIM36 staining.

GENE STRUCTURE

Balint et al. (2004) determined that the TRIM36 gene contains 10 exons
and spans 55 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Reymond et al. (2001) mapped the TRIM36
gene to chromosome 5q22. By shotgun sequencing, Balint et al. (2004)
identified the TRIM36 gene within a BAC mapped to chromosome 5q22.3.

606055	TITLE *606055 PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE TRANSFER PROTEIN; PCTP
;;START DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; STARD2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Phosphatidylcholine (PC) transfer protein (PCTP) is a cytosolic protein
first purified from bovine and rat liver that catalyzes intermembrane
transfer of PC. By searching an EST database for homologs of bovine
Pctp, followed by 5-prime RACE and PCR of a kidney cDNA library, Cohen
et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA encoding human PCTP. The deduced 214-amino
acid human protein is 76% and 80% identical to bovine and rat Pctp,
respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of an
approximately 2.3-kb PCTP transcript in all tissues tested except
thymus. Highest expression was detected in liver, placenta, testis,
kidney, and heart, and lowest levels were found in brain and lung.

Van Helvoort et al. (1999) cloned human and mouse PCTP. They noted that
the sn2 fatty acyl-binding domain is 100% identical in the rodent,
bovine, and human proteins.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using Southern blot analysis, van Helvoort et al. (1999) determined that
PCTP is a single-copy gene. By genomic sequence analysis, Cohen et al.
(1999) showed that the PCTP gene contains 6 exons and spans 13 to 23 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Cohen et al. (1999) mapped the PCTP gene
to 17q21-q22. They localized the mouse gene to the central portion of
chromosome 11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Van Helvoort et al. (1999) disrupted the Pctp gene in mice. Pctp
knockout mice showed no defects in the secretion of PC into bile or lung
surfactant, and the lipid content and composition of bile and surfactant
was normal. The authors concluded that PCTP does not play a major role
in transporting PC from the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is
synthesized, to the hepatocyte canalicular membrane.

123857	TITLE *123857 CYSTATIN 4; CST4
;;CYSTATIN S
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

See CST1 (123855) and CST5 (123858) for general information about
cystatins, inhibitors of cysteine proteinases. Saitoh et al. (1991)
cloned the CST4 gene by screening a genomic library with the CST1 gene.
The CST4 gene encodes the 141-amino acid precursor form of cystatin S.
(The cystatin D gene was originally called CST4 but later renamed CST5.)

By RNase protection assay of 23 human tissues, Dickinson et al. (2002)
found that the level of CST4 was highest in submandibular gland,
intermediate in parotid gland, lacrimal gland, and gallbladder, lower in
kidney and seminal vesicles, and lowest in prostate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Saitoh et al. (1991) determined that the CST4 gene is composed of 3
exons spanning less than 4 kb.

MAPPING

Dickinson et al. (1994) mapped the CST4 gene to 20p11.2 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization. CST4 is clustered with other family II cystatins
in a region that spans less than 905 kb.
