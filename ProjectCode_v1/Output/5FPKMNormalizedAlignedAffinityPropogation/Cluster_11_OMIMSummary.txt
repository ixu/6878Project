DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs, such as MIR152, are noncoding RNAs of 18 to 24 nucleotides
that bind the 3-prime UTRs of target mRNAs and control protein
expression through translational repression or mRNA degradation. MIR148B
regulates the innate immune response (Liu et al., 2010).

GENE FUNCTION

Using computer and functional analyses, Liu et al. (2010) identified 3
members of the MIR148 family, Mir148a (613786), Mir148b (613787), and
Mir152, as negative regulators of the innate immune response and the
antigen-presenting capacity of mouse dendritic cells (DCs). Expression
of Mir148a, Mir148b, and Mir152 was upregulated in mouse DCs on
maturation and activation induced by Tlr3 (603029), Tlr4 (603030), and
Tlr9 (605474) agonists. In contrast, expression of Camk2a (114078), an
important DC regulator, was downregulated in the presence of these
agonists. Mir148/Mir152 overexpression inhibited production of
cytokines, including Il12 (see 161560), Il6 (147620), Tnf (191160), and
Ifnb, (147640), upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class
II expression, and DC-initiated antigen-specific T-cell proliferation by
targeting Camk2a expression. Liu et al. (2010) proposed that MIR148A,
MIR148B, and MIR152 fine tune the innate immune response.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the MIR152 gene to chromosome 17q21.32 based on an
alignment of the mature MIR152 sequence (UCAGUGCAUGACAGAACUUGG) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).
