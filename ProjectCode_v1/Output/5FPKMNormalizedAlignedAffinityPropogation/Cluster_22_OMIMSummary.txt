615428	TITLE *615428 DEAD BOX POLYPEPTIDE 47; DDX47
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DDX47 is predicted to be an RNA helicase with a role in early ribosomal
biogenesis (Sekiguchi et al., 2006).

CLONING

Sekiguchi et al. (2006) cloned DDX47 by PCR of a human Burkitt lymphoma
cDNA library. The deduced 455-amino acid protein has a DEADc RNA
helicase domain in its N-terminal half, followed by a helicase
superfamily C-terminal (HELICc) domain. It also has an N-terminal
nuclear export signal and a C-terminal nuclear localization signal.
Fluorescence-tagged DDX47 colocalized with the nucleolar proteins NOP132
(NOL8; 611534) and KIAA0559 (NAP1; 608865) in nucleoli of transfected
HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analyses, Lee et al.
(2005) identified DDX47 as a binding partner of GABARAP (605125) in
human 2774 and SKOV-3 ovarian tumor cell lysates. Yeast 2-hybrid
analysis confirmed the interaction. Overexpression of either DDX47 or
GABARAP alone had no effect on proliferation of SKOV-3 cells; however,
their coexpression inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis.

Sekiguchi et al. (2006) characterized proteins that immunoprecipitated
with epitope-tagged NOP132 from human 293EBNA cells. Mass spectrometric
and database analysis identified DDX18 (606355) and DDX47, in addition
to many proteins from the large and small ribosomal subunits and
proteins previously characterized in human pre-ribosomal nucleoprotein
complexes. A similar complement of proteins immunoprecipitated with
DDX18 or DDX47. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed association
of NOP132 with DDX18 and DDX47, but not with other DDX proteins. RNase
treatment significantly decreased association of NOP132 with DDX18 and
DDX47, suggesting that their interaction depends on RNA. Similarly,
RNase treatment released most of the NOP132-, DDX18-, and
DDX47-associated proteins. Epitope-tagged DDX47 associated with several
rRNA precursors and with 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNA, suggesting that DDX47
is involved in early stages of pre-rRNA processing. Knockdown of NOP132
by small interfering RNA caused mislocalization of DDX47 to the
nucleolar periphery. Knockdown of either NOP132 or DDX47 decreased the
amount of mature rRNA and rRNA precursors. Mutation analysis revealed
that the coiled-coil region of NOP132 interacted with the HELICc motif
of DDX47. Sekiguchi et al. (2006) concluded that NOP132 is required for
proper targeting of DDX47 to the nucleolar organizing region, and that
DDX47 has a role in early ribosome biogenesis.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the DDX47 gene to chromosome 12p13.1 based on an
alignment of the DDX47 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF078843) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37). Sekiguchi et al. (2006)

;;MEMBRANE PROGESTIN RECEPTOR, GAMMA; MPRG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using homology with the sequence of seatrout membrane progestin
receptor, Zhu et al. (2003) identified ESTs containing MPRG, and they
cloned full-length human, mouse, and pufferfish MPRG cDNAs. The deduced
proteins contain about 330 amino acids, consisting of an extracellular N
terminus, an intracellular C terminus, and 7 transmembrane domains.
Northern blot analysis detected a 5.8-kb transcript expressed at high
levels only in kidney. RNA dot blot analysis detected highest expression
in adult and fetal kidney, colon, lung carcinoma, and HeLa cells, and
showed possible expression in adrenal gland and normal lung.

Tang et al. (2005) stated that the 7-transmembrane domain of the
full-length 330-amino acid PAQR5 protein shares significant similarity
with those of ADIPOR1 (607945) and ADIPOR2 (607946). The mouse ortholog
shares 91% amino acid identity with human PAQR5. RT-PCR detected highest
PAQR5 expression in human lung, colon, and small intestine. Weaker
expression was detected in pancreas, lymph node, kidney, brain, testis,
bladder, skin, and adult bone marrow, and little to none was detected in
adrenal gland, stomach, skeletal muscle, adipose, liver, prostate,
breast, heart, and thymus.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhu et al. (2003) determined that recombinant MPRG, expressed by E.
coli, showed high-affinity progesterone binding. Steroid competition
studies showed specific binding to progesterone and several of its
hydroxylated derivatives, whereas estrogen, androgen, and corticosteroid
had low or no affinity for the receptor. Association and dissociation
kinetics were rapid.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tang et al. (2005) determined that the PAQR5 gene contains 7 coding
exons.

MAPPING

Zhu (2003) stated that the human MPRG gene maps to chromosome 15. By
genomic sequence analysis, Tang et al. (2005) mapped the PAQR5 gene to
chromosome 15q23.

186852	TITLE *186852 PROTEASOME 26S SUBUNIT, ATPase, 3; PSMC3
;;TAT-BINDING PROTEIN 1; TBP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) protein Tat is a potent
activator of virus gene expression and replication. Nelbock et al.
(1990) used biotinylated Tat as a probe to screen a lambda-gt11 fusion
protein library, thereby cloning a cDNA encoding a protein that
interacts with Tat. Expression of this protein, designated Tat-binding
protein-1, was observed in a variety of cell lines, with expression
being highest in human cells. TBP1 was localized predominantly in the
nucleus, which is consistent with the nuclear localization of Tat. In
cotransfection experiments, expression of TBP1 was able to suppress
Tat-mediated transactivation specifically. Nelbock et al. (1990)
recommended their strategy for direct identification and cloning of
genes encoding proteins that associate with other proteins to modulate
their activity in a positive or negative fashion. Ohana et al. (1993)
suggested that TBP1 is involved in Tat-mediated transcriptional
activation.

GENE FUNCTION

Ubiquitinated proteins are degraded by a 26S ATP-dependent protease. The
protease is composed of a 20S catalytic proteasome and 2 PA700
regulatory modules (see PSMC1; 602706). DeMartino et al. (1996)
identified a protein complex that enhances PA700 activation of the
proteasome. They found that 2 proteins, p42 (PSMC6; 602708) and p50
(PSMC3), are components of both this complex and PA700. By protein
sequence analysis, DeMartino et al. (1996) determined that p50 and TBP1
are identical.

Hoyle et al. (1997) stated that the PSMC3 gene encodes a protein with 1
AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) domain (see
PSMC5; 601681) toward the C terminus.

Corn et al. (2003) established that pVHL (608537), the protein that is
mutant in von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (193300), binds to TBP1. TBP1
associates with the beta-domain of pVHL and complexes with pVHL and
hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF1A (603348) in vivo.
Overexpression of TBP1 promotes degradation of HIF1A in a pVHL-dependent
manner that requires the ATPase domain of TBP1. Several distinct
mutations in exon 2 of the VHL gene disrupt binding of pVHL to TBP1. A
pVHL mutant containing an exon 2 missense substitution
coimmunoprecipitated with HIF1A, but not TBP1, and did not promote
degradation of HIF1A. Thus, the ability of pVHL to degrade HIF1A depends
in part on its interaction with TBP1 and suggests a new mechanism for
HIF1A stabilization in some pVHL-deficient tumors.

MAPPING

By PCR amplification of a partial PSMC3 sequence, Hoyle et al. (1997)
demonstrated that the PSMC3 gene is located on chromosome 11. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the assignment was
regionalized to 11p13-p12. Tanahashi et al. (1998) mapped the PSMC3 gene
to 11p11.2 by FISH. By interspecific backcross analysis, Sakao et al.
(2000) mapped the mouse Psmc3 gene to chromosome 2.

BECKWITH-WIEDEMANN REGION 1C; BWR1C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

A region of 11p15.5 contains several genes with documented functional
imprinting, defined as a consistent allelic bias of RNA expression in
somatic tissues. Imprinted genes in this region include H19 (103280),
IGF2 (147470), CDKN1C (600856), and KVLQT1 (607542). The size of the
region that contains these genes is approximately 1 Mb, similar to the
Prader-Willi syndrome (176270)/Angelman syndrome (105830) region of
chromosome 15, which also contains multiple imprinted genes. Qian et al.
(1997) stated that a strong sex bias in the rates of meiotic
recombination in imprinted regions suggested an accessibility model for
genomic imprinting in which extended regions of 'open chromatin'
specific to one type of gamete are selectively modified epigenetically,
leading to allele-specific transcription of at least a subset of the
genes in these regions in the offspring. A prediction is that a
positional cloning approach, i.e., chromosome walking in the vicinity of
known imprinted genes, should be successful in isolating additional
imprinted genes. Qian et al. (1997) described the human and mouse
versions of a novel imprinted gene, symbolized IPL (for 'imprinted in
placenta and liver') by them, that they identified by this approach. IPL
is located between NAP2 (601651) on the centromeric side and KIP2
(CDKN1C; 600856) on the telomeric side. In many human and mouse tissues,
the gene showed tissue-specific expression and functional imprinting,
with the maternal allele active and the paternal allele relatively
inactive. The mouse and human genes showed sequence similarity to
TDAG51, a gene that had been shown to be essential for FAS (134637) gene
expression and susceptibility to apoptosis in a T lymphocyte cell line.
Qian et al. (1997) detected high expression in the placenta, with lower
expression in the chorioamniotic membrane and a very low expression in
fetal and adult liver, lung, and kidney and adult pancreas.

By genetic analysis of a 170-kb region at 11p15.5 between loci D11S601
and D11S679, Schwienbacher et al. (1998) identified 6 transcriptional
units. Three of these, NAP2, CDKN1C, and KVLQT1, had been well
characterized, whereas the other 3 genes were novel. These were
symbolized BWR1A (602631), BWR1B (603240), and BWR1C, with BWR
designating 'Beckwith-Wiedemann region.'

GENE FUNCTION

Muller et al. (2000) stated that TSSC3 is the first apoptosis-related
gene found to be imprinted in placenta, liver, and fetal tissues, where
it is expressed from the maternal allele during normal human
development. Since several embryonal tumors show loss of imprinting of
genes in the 11p15.5 region, Muller et al. (2000) investigated the
imprinting status of TSSC3 in normal human adult brain, neuroblastomas,
medulloblastomas, and glioblastomas. Using a polymorphism in exon 1,
they found that the TSSC3 gene is not imprinted in normal human adult
brain or blood. In contrast, strong allelic bias resembling imprinting
could be detected in most tumors examined. The authors concluded that
the tumors under investigation are associated with a retention of
imprinting of a potential growth inhibitory gene.

MAPPING

Qian et al. (1997) identified the PHLDA2 gene on chromosome 11p15.5, in
a region that contains many imprinted genes. Qian et al. (1997)
determined that the mouse Ipl gene maps to the region of chromosome 7
that is syntenic with human 11p15.5.

GENE STRUCTURE

Like several other imprinted genes, mouse and human IPL are small and
contain small introns; human IPL contains a single 223-bp intron (Qian
et al., 1997).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ishida et al. (2012) identified a 15-bp tandem repeat (GGGGCGGGGAGGGGC)
located 48 bp upstream of the PHLDA2 transcription start site. The
tandem repeat is present in 87% of chromosomes. The minor allele is a
single copy and found in the remaining 13% of chromosomes.

For discussion of a possible association between variation in this
PHLDA2 promoter variant and birth weight, see 613219.

ANIMAL MODEL

The IPL gene lies in an extended imprinted region of distal mouse
chromosome 7, which also contains the IGF2 gene. Expression of Ipl is
highest in placenta and yolk sac, where its mRNA is derived almost
entirely from the maternal allele. Ipl encodes a small cytoplasmic
protein with a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain (summary by Frank et al.,
1999). Frank et al. (2002) constructed 2 lines of mice with germline
deletions of this gene and another line deleted for the similar but
nonimprinted gene Tih1 (607054). All 3 lines were viable. There was
consistent overgrowth of the Ipl-null placentas, with expansion of the
spongiotrophoblast. These larger placentas did not confer a fetal growth
advantage; fetal size was normal or slightly decreased in Ipl nulls.
When bred into an Igf2 mutant background, the Ipl deletion partially
rescued the placental but not fetal growth deficiency. Neither fetal nor
placental growth was affected by deletion of Tih1. These results showed
a nonredundant function of Ipl in restraining placental growth. The data
further indicated that Ipl can act, at least in part, independently of
insulin-like growth factor 2 signaling. Thus, genomic imprinting
regulates multiple pathways to control placental size.

;;CAS-INTERACTING ZINC FINGER PROTEIN; CIZ;;
CAGH1;;
NUCLEAR MATRIX PROTEIN 4; NMP4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZNF384 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that localizes at
fibroblast focal adhesions, contains multiple zinc fingers, and
regulates expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g., MMP3; 185250)
(Thunyakitpisal et al., 2001).

CLONING

By screening adult and fetal human brain cDNA libraries for clones
containing CAG repeats, Margolis et al. (1997) isolated a partial cDNA
encoding ZNF384, which they called CAGH1.

By Far Western screening of a rat embryonic fibroblast cDNA library with
the SH3 domain of Cas (BCAR1; 602941) as probe, Nakamoto et al. (2000)
isolated several splice variants of Znf384, which they called Ciz. The
longest variant encodes a predicted 579-residue protein with an
N-terminal leucine zipper, multiple serine and proline residues, a
nuclear localization signal, 8 centrally located Kruppel-type C2H2 zinc
fingers, and C-terminal glutamine-alanine and glutamine repeat regions,
suggesting that Ciz may be a transcription factor. The shorter variants
encode proteins with only 5 or 6 zinc fingers. Northern blot analysis of
rat tissues revealed ubiquitous expression of a 3.0-kb transcript, with
highest levels in testis, heart, kidney, and brain. A 4.0-kb transcript
was also detected in brain, liver, and kidney. Immunofluorescence
microscopy showed that Ciz shuttled in and out of the nucleus and
localized at stably formed focal adhesions and in the nucleus.

Thunyakitpisal et al. (2001) independently cloned and characterized rat
Znf384, which they termed Nmp4, based on its interaction with type I
collagen alpha-1 (COL1A1; 120150). They identified several novel
variants, including one that lacks the C-terminal glutamine-alanine
repeat region.

GENE FUNCTION

Using precipitation analysis, Nakamoto et al. (2000) showed that rat Ciz
bound specifically and constitutively to the SH3 domain of Cas.
Immunoprecipitation and EMSA analysis demonstrated that Ciz bound to the
promoter of human MMP1 (120353) and upregulated transcription of human
MMP1 and MMP7 (178990) and rat Mmp3.

Thunyakitpisal et al. (2001) showed that rat Nmp4 interacted with Col1a1
and regulated its expression in osteoblasts. They concluded that NMP4
contributes to extracellular matrix turnover in bone and other tissues.

Shen et al. (2002) overexpressed Ciz in a mouse osteoblast cell line and
found that it inhibited Bmp2 (112261)-induced expression of alkaline
phosphatase (see ALPL; 171760), osteocalcin (BGLAP; 112260), type I
collagen, and Cbfa1 (RUNX2; 600211). They concluded that CIZ is an
inhibitory protein that modulates BMP2-induced differentiation of
osteoblastic cells.

MAPPING

Margolis et al. (1997) stated that the ZFN384 gene maps to chromosome
12p12. Alvarez et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Znf384 gene to chromosome
6F1, a region that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 12p12.

ANIMAL MODEL

Morinobu et al. (2005) found that Ciz -/- mice had increased bone volume
and rates of bone formation, but no alteration in bone resorption. Ciz
-/- mice expressed higher levels of mRNA for proteins involved in
osteoblastic phenotypes, such as alkaline phosphatase and osterix (SP7;
606633). Ciz deficiency increased newly formed bone mass after femoral
bone marrow ablation, and it increased Bmp2-induced bone formation in
adult mouse calvariae. Morinobu et al. (2005) concluded that CIZ
suppresses the levels of adult bone mass through inhibition of
BMP-induced activation of osteoblasts.

;;PSTPIP;;
CD2 ANTIGEN-BINDING PROTEIN 1; CD2BP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Spencer et al. (1997) identified mouse Pstpip1 as a binding protein of
the PEST-type protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs, e.g., PTP-PEST;
600079).

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a T-cell cDNA library with the
cytoplasmic tail of CD2 (186990) as bait, followed by probing a T-cell
cDNA library, Li et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding splice variants
of human PSTPIP1, which they called CD2BP1. The full-length 417-amino
acid protein, which is 88% identical to mouse Pstpip1, contains a
coiled-coil region, which is 30% identical to yeast Cdc15, a PEST
region, and a C-terminal SH3 domain. Compared with full-length CD2BP1,
the shorter variant has a 19-amino acid deletion. Northern blot analysis
revealed expression of a 1.9-kb CD2BP1 transcript that was restricted to
hemopoietic tissues and cell lines, with expression upregulated in
activated T cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed expression of a
50-kD protein. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated localization of
CD2BP1 at the interface of the cytosol and the plasma membrane and
colocalization with CD2 after ligand-induced clustering of surface CD2.

GENE FUNCTION

Binding analysis by Li et al. (1998) showed that the CD2BP1 SH3 domain
interacts with proline-rich segments of the CD2 cytoplasmic tail.
Functional analysis indicated a lack of kinase activity, but significant
tyrosine phosphatase activity.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Cong et al. (2000) identified mouse
Pstpip1 as an ABL (189980)-interacting protein. They showed that Pstpip1
was phosphorylated by ABL. Growth factor-induced Pstpip1 phosphorylation
was diminished in ABL null fibroblasts. Pstpip1 was able to bridge ABL
to the PEST-type PTPs. Several experiments suggested that the PEST-type
PTPs negatively regulate ABL activity: ABL was hyperphosphorylated in
PTP-PEST-deficient cells; disruption of the ABL-Pstpip1-PEST-type PTP
ternary complex by overexpression of mutants increased ABL
phosphotyrosine content; and PDGF (see 190040)-induced ABL kinase
activation was prolonged in PTP-PEST-deficient cells. The authors
concluded that dephosphorylation of ABL by PSTPIP1-directed PEST-type
PTPs represents a novel mechanism by which ABL activity is regulated.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Shoham et al. (2003) showed that human
PSTPIP1 and human pyrin (MEFV; 608107) interacted with each other and
colocalized within peripheral blood granulocytes and monocytes. Tyrosine
phosphorylation of PSTPIP1 markedly increased binding to pyrin.
Expression of 2 PSTPIP1 mutations (606347.0001 and 606347.0002)
associated with PAPA syndrome (604416) resulted in increased
PSTPIP1-pyrin binding. Shoham et al. (2003) suggested that sequestration
of pyrin in PAPA syndrome may prevent pyrin's normal immunoregulatory
functions, resulting in an excess of IL1-beta (147720) production, as
found in a patient with PAPA syndrome. The findings elucidated another
pathway involved in regulating inflammation, and linked PAPA syndrome
and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF; 249100) as disorders arising from
defects within the same pathway.

Yu et al. (2007) found that both pyrin and PSTPIP1 formed homotrimers,
and that the pyrin homotrimer was inactive due to masking of its PYD
motif by its B box. PSTPIP1 activated pyrin by binding to its B box and
unmasking the PYD, leading to interaction of the PYD with ASC (PYCARD;
606838), ASC dimerization, and recruitment and activation of caspase-1
(CASP1; 147678), a proinflammatory enzyme. Autoinflammatory PSTPIP1
mutants had higher binding affinities for the pyrin B box than did
wildtype PSTPIP1.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PSTPIP1
gene to 15q24-q25.1 (TMAP D15S1170).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Yeon et al. (2000) localized the genes for PAPA syndrome (604416) and
familial recurrent arthritis to chromosome 15q and suggested that they
are the same disorder. Wise et al. (2002) identified mutations in the
PSTPIP1 gene in 2 reported families with this disorder. E250Q
(606347.0001) or A230T (606347.0002) amino acid substitutions occurred
within a domain highly homologous to yeast cleavage furrow-associated
protein CDC15. PSTPIP1 and its murine ortholog are adaptor proteins
known to interact with PEST-type PTPs such as PTPN12 (600079). Yeast
2-hybrid assays demonstrated severely reduced binding between PTPN12 and
both the E250Q and A230T mutant proteins. Previous evidence supported
the integral role of PSTPIP1 and its interacting proteins in actin
reorganization during cytoskeletal-mediated events. The authors
hypothesized that the disease-causing mutations identified compromise
physiologic signaling necessary for the maintenance of a proper
inflammatory response.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PYOGENIC STERILE ARTHRITIS, PYODERMA GANGRENOSUM, AND ACNE
PSTPIP1, GLU250GLN

In a 4-generation family with familial recurrent arthritis, which was
thought to be the same disorder as PAPA syndrome (604416), Wise et al.
(2002) identified a 964G-C transversion in the PSTPIP1 gene, which was
predicted to result in a glu250-to-gln (E250Q) substitution. Yeast
2-hybrid assays demonstrated severely reduced binding between PTPN12 and
the mutant protein.

.0002
PYOGENIC STERILE ARTHRITIS, PYODERMA GANGRENOSUM, AND ACNE
PSTPIP1, ALA230THR

In affected sibs with PAPA syndrome (604416), Wise et al. (2002)
identified a 904G-A transition in the PSTPIP1 gene, which was predicted
to result in an ala230-to-thr (A230T) substitution. Yeast 2-hybrid
assays demonstrated severely reduced binding between PTPN12 and the
mutant protein.

150150	TITLE *150150 LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE C; LDHC
;;LDH, TESTICULAR FORM; LDHX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zinkham et al. (1964) found a distinctive LDH isozyme in mature testes
of many species including man. It is polymorphic in the pigeon, and one
can infer that a locus separate from LDHA (150000) and LDHB (150100)
controls it. The same is almost certainly true in the human. This is a
gene that functions only in one sex and only in one tissue.

Sakai et al. (1987) isolated and sequenced cDNA clones of LDHC from the
mouse. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)-containing RNAs from mouse
testes and liver indicated that the Ldhc gene was expressed in testes
but not in liver. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of mouse Ldhc
showed 73 and 72% homology, respectively, with those of mouse Ldha.
Southern blot analysis of genomic DNAs from mouse liver and human
placenta indicated the presence of multiple LDH-C gene-related
sequences. From the amino acid sequence deduced from cDNA, Millan et al.
(1987) found that human LDHC is as different from rodent Ldhc (73%
homology) as it is from human LDHA (76% homology) and porcine LDHB (68%
homology).

MAPPING

Zinkham et al. (1969) found that the LDHB and LDHC loci are closely
linked in pigeons. Edwards et al. (1987) used an LDHC cDNA to analyze
genomic DNA from rodent/human somatic cell hybrids. These showed that
LDHA and LDHC are syntenic on human chromosome 11. The assignment of
LDHC was confirmed by Kao et al. (1988), who localized the gene to
11p15.5-p14.3 by use of somatic cell hybrids and in situ chromosome
hybridization. Li et al. (1988) also assigned LDHC to chromosome 11 by
hybridization of DNA from flow-sorted chromosomes. The close physical
proximity of the LDHC and LDHA genes supports the evolutionary
relatedness of the 2 isozymes. Edwards et al. (1989) reported mapping of
LDHC to 11p15.5-p15.3 by combination of somatic cell hybrid studies and
in situ hybridization.

;;MSX2-INTERACTING NUCLEAR TARGET; MINT;;
SMART/HDAC1-ASSOCIATED REPRESSOR PROTEIN; SHARP;;
KIAA0929
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SPEN appears to function as a nuclear matrix platform that organizes and
integrates transcriptional responses (Sierra et al., 2004).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned a partial SPEN cDNA, which they
designated KIAA0929. RT-PCR ELISA detected SPEN expression in all adult
and fetal tissues and specific adult brain regions examined, with
highest expression in adult lung, liver, ovary, and spinal cord.

Newberry et al. (1999) cloned mouse Spen, which they called Mint. The
deduced 3,576-amino acid protein is rich in proline and serine and has a
calculated molecular mass of 390 kD. It has a predicted N-terminal
helical domain with 3 RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and 3 nuclear
localization signals. The C-terminal half of Mint has high coil and beta
stand content and contains an additional nuclear localization signal.
Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected a 12.6-kb transcript
that was highly expressed in testis, with lower levels in brain, spleen,
lung, liver, and kidney. It was also expressed in differentiating mouse
MC3T3E1 calvarial osteoblasts. Fractionation of MC3T3E1 cells showed
that Mint was processed into 110-kD N-terminal and 250-kD C-terminal
protein fragments that accumulated with chromatin and nuclear matrix
fractions.

Using the C terminus of the nuclear receptor corepressor SMRT (NCOR2;
600848) as bait to screen human pituitary and liver cDNA libraries, Shi
et al. (2001) cloned SPEN, which they called SHARP. The deduced
3,651-amino acid protein contains 3 N-terminal RRMs, a central receptor
interaction domain (RID), and a C-terminal SMRT interaction
domain/repression domain (SID/RD). It also contains 4 consensus nuclear
localization signals. Northern blot analysis detected a SHARP transcript
of more than 12 kb. Highest expression was in brain, testis, spleen, and
thymus, with lower expression in kidney, liver, mammary gland, and skin.
SHARP expression was also detected in several human tumor cell lines.
Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected human embryonic kidney cells
revealed SHARP in a speckled nuclear localization.

Oswald et al. (2002) reported that SHARP contains 3,664 amino acids.
They identified 4 putative N-terminal RRMs, 5 nuclear localization
signals spaced throughout the molecule, and an RBP (see RBPJ;
147183)-interacting domain following the RID.

GENE FUNCTION

Using far Western analysis, Newberry et al. (1999) found that Msx2
(123101) interacted with Mint in a mouse brain expression library. The 2
proteins cosegregated with topisomerase II (see 126430) in chromatin and
nuclear matrix fractions. Gel shift analysis showed that the Mint RRM
domain bound T- and G-rich sequences, including a large G/T inverted
repeat element in the proximal promoter of rat osteocalcin (OC, or
BGLAP; 112260). Transient expression of the Mint N-terminal domain
suppressed FGF (see 131220)/forskolin-activated Oc promoter. Mint
expression was downregulated with differentiation of MC3T3E1 cells,
concomitant with upregulation of the Oc gene.

Sierra et al. (2004) showed that mouse Mint synergized with Runx2
(600211) to enhance Fgfr2 (176943)-mediated activation of the
osteocalcin FGF-responsive element (OCFRE). The RRM domain of Mint and
activation domain-3 of Runx2 were required for this activity. Confocal
immunofluorescence microscopy showed that nuclear colocalization of Mint
and Runx2 was enhanced by Fgf2 (134920) stimulation, and Mint enhanced
Runx2 activation of multiprotein complexes assembled by the OCFRE. Msx2
functioned as an inhibitor of Runx2-Mint activation of OCFRE. Sierra et
al. (2004) concluded that MINT may serve as a nuclear matrix platform
that organizes and integrates transcriptional responses.

By coimmunoprecipitation of transfected epitope-tagged proteins and by
protein pull-down assays, Shi et al. (2001) showed that SHARP interacted
directly with HDAC1 (601241). HDAC1 readily coimmunoprecipitated with
SHARP and with at least 5 members of the NuRD complex (see MTA1;
603526), and SHARP immunocomplexes displayed histone deacetylase
activity. SHARP also interacted with steroid receptor RNA cofactor SRA
(603819) and repressed SRA-potentiated steroid receptor activity. SHARP
expression was induced in MCF-7 breast cancer cells by estrogen E2
treatment. Shi et al. (2001) concluded that SHARP can function as a
cofactor for both coactivators and corepressors.

The DNA-binding protein CBF1 (RBPJ; 147183) is a transcriptional
repressor. By yeast 2-hybrid screening of embryonic human liver,
followed by protein pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays, Oswald
et al. (2002) showed that SHARP interacted directly with CBF1 (RBPJ;
147183), a DNA-binding transcriptional repressor. In cotransfection
experiments, SHARP repressed transcription in an HDAC-dependent fashion
and inhibited transactivation mediated by Notch1 (190198).
Overexpression of SHARP in Xenopus embryos induced a neurogenic
phenotype and rescued loss of primary neurogenesis resulting from
overexpression of dominant-active Notch1. Oswald et al. (2002) concluded
that SHARP is recruited by CBF1 to an HDAC corepressor complex that
regulates the Notch signaling pathway.

Salat et al. (2008) found that ETO (RUNX1T1; 133435) interacted directly
with the RD of SHARP in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human fetal brain
library. ETO also coimmunoprecipitated with RBPJ and SHARP from HEL
cells. Mutation analysis revealed that NHR1 and NHR2 of ETO interacted
with the RD of SHARP. ETO and SHARP colocalized with RBPJ at promoter
regions of Notch target genes. ETO expression augmented SHARP-mediated
repression of reporter gene expression in an HDAC-dependent manner.
Pharmacologic inhibition of HDAC activity completely abrogated the
repressive activity of ETO-RBPJ-SHARP in reporter gene activation.
Knockdown of ETO activated Notch target genes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the SPEN gene to chromosome 1p36.13 based on an
alignment of the SPEN sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB023146) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

179514	TITLE *179514 RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB5B; RAB5B
DESCRIPTION A number of processes in eukaryotic cells are believed to be regulated
by small, monomeric GTPases belonging to the RAS superfamily. A subset
of these GTPases (the yeast YPTI/SEC4 gene products and their mammalian
counterparts, the RAB proteins) plays a central role in membrane
trafficking. Each of the several proteins of this subfamily that have
been identified is thought to regulate vesicular trafficking at a
specific subcellular compartment. The subcellular location of several
RAB proteins has been determined by immunohistochemical methods. For
example, RAB2 (179509) is found in the intermediate recycling pathway
between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex. RAB6 (179513)
is distributed in the medial and trans Golgi. RAB4 (179511) and RAB5A
(179512) are associated with the plasma membrane and early endosomes.
Wilson and Wilson (1992) cloned cDNA of a novel member of the RAB family
by screening a human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA library with
oligonucleotide probes corresponding to a region conserved in all RAB
proteins. The newly identified RAB protein was 81% identical to human
RAB5, the canine counterpart of which had been localized to the plasma
membrane and early endosomes. In light of this homology, Wilson and
Wilson (1992) called the new member of the GTPase superfamily RAB5B. It
is presumably involved in vesicular trafficking at the plasma membrane.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Korenberg et al. (1995) mapped
the RAB5B gene to 12q13.

;;MTAP6;;
STABLE TUBULE-ONLY POLYPEPTIDE; STOP;;
KIAA1878
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mammalian cells often contain abundant subpopulations of microtubules
that are stable to both drug- and cold temperature-induced disassembly.
Such microtubules are apparently universal in the neurite extensions of
neuronal cells. Bosc et al. (1996) cloned and characterized the gene
encoding a rat protein that reconstitutes microtubule cold stability in
vitro. The protein, called stable tubule-only polypeptide (STOP) by
them, is a 100.5-kD polypeptide. The central region of the predicted
952-amino acid polypeptide contains 5 tandem repeats of 46 amino acids.
STOP also contains a putative SH3-binding motif near its N terminus.

Denarier et al. (1998) determined that the deduced mouse Map6 protein
contains 906 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of about
96.4 kD.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult hippocampus
cDNA library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned MAP6, which they designated
KIAA1878. The transcript contains a repetitive element in the 3-prime
UTR. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest MAP6 expression in fetal brain,
followed by spinal cord, adult brain, testis, kidney, lung, heart, and
ovary. Lower expression was detected in pancreas, spleen, and skeletal
muscle, and little to no expression was detected in adult and fetal
liver. All specific brain regions showed intermediate to high
expression, with highest expression in caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and
cerebellum.

GENE FUNCTION

Bosc et al. (1996) found that in vitro-translated STOP bound to
microtubules and calmodulin (114180). When STOP cDNA was expressed in
HeLa cells, which lack cold-stable microtubules, the protein product
associated with microtubules at 37 degrees C and stabilized microtubule
networks, which induced cold stability, nocodazole resistance, and
tubulin detyrosination.

GENE STRUCTURE

Denarier et al. (1998) determined that the mouse Map6 gene contains 4
exons and spans about 40 kb. The 5-prime flanking region lacks a TATA
box or an initiator element.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the MAP6 gene
to chromosome 11. Jolly et al. (1999) reported a conflicting assignment
of the human MAP6 gene to chromosome 6p12-p11 by FISH. However, Andrieux
et al. (2002) confirmed that the human MAP6 gene maps to chromosome
11q14.

Using FISH, Denarier et al. (1998) mapped the mouse Map6 gene to region
E2-F1 of chromosome 7, which shows homology of synteny to human
chromosome 11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Andrieux et al. (2002) found that Stop-null mice had no detectable
defects in brain anatomy, but they showed synaptic defects, with
depleted synaptic vesicle pools and impaired synaptic plasticity,
associated with severe behavioral disorders. A survey of the effects of
psychotropic drugs on the behavior of Stop-null mice showed a specific
effect of long-term administration of neuroleptics in alleviating these
disorders.

601671	TITLE *601671 D4, ZINC, AND DOUBLE PHD FINGERS FAMILY, MEMBER 2; DPF2
;;REQUIEM, APOPTOSIS RESPONSE ZINC FINGER GENE; REQ;;
UBI-D4/REQUIEM HOMOLOG; UBID4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chestkov et al. (1996) described a conserved human gene homologous to
Neuro-d4 (DPF1; 601670) that they designated Ubi-d4. The human protein
is the apparent homolog of the mouse Ubi-d4 protein, also known as
Requiem (Gabig et al., 1994).

Apoptosis in murine myeloid cell lines requires expression of the
Requiem gene, which encodes a putative zinc finger protein. A large
consortium (Gabig et al., 1998) consisting of 3 groups detected the
protein in both cytoplasmic and nuclear subcellular fractions of murine
myeloid cells and human K562 leukemia cells, suggesting that the protein
may have a function distinct from that of a transcription factor. The
distribution did not alter upon apoptosis induction by IL3 deprivation.
The gene was expressed in various tissues in early gestational ages;
however, expression was confined to testis, spleen, thymus, and part of
the hippocampus in the adult mouse. The expression profile was
considered consistent with a functional role during rapid growth and
cell turnover, and again suggested a regulatory function for
hematopoietic cells. The nucleotide sequence of the human cDNA is 73%
identical overall to that of the murine cDNA. The human sequence encodes
a 391-amino acid protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Expression of Ubi-d4/requiem appeared to be required for apoptosis
(Chestkov et al., 1996; Gabig et al., 1994).

MAPPING

Chestkov et al. (1996) mapped the DPF2 gene to chromosome 11q13 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

By cohybridization fluorescence in situ hybridization on extended DNA
fibers, Gabig et al. (1998) mapped the REQ gene between MLK3 (600050)
and FAU (134690), which had been mapped to 11q13, telomeric to PYGM
(608455). The physical distance between MLK3 and REQ was estimated to be
150 kb.

602074	TITLE *602074 DEATH-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 3; DAP3
;;MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S29; MRPS29
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kissil et al. (1995) cloned DAP3. DAP3 is transcribed into a 1.7-kb mRNA
and encodes a 46-kD protein carrying a potential nucleotide-binding
motif.

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human DAP3, which they called MRPS29. The deduced 397-amino
acid MRPS29 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 45.6 kD. Removal
of a predicted 16-amino acid N-terminal mitochondrial localization
signal results in a mature 43.6-kD protein. Koc et al. (2001) identified
MRPS29 orthologs in mouse, Drosophila, C. elegans, and yeast, but not in
E. coli. Mouse and human MRPS29 share 81.8% amino acid identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Kissil et al. (1995) found that DAP3 was involved in mediating
interferon-gamma (147570)-induced cell death. Several lines of evidence
suggested that suppression of cell death is a critical step in the
multistage process of tumorigenesis. Kissil et al. (1995) concluded that
DAP3, being a positive mediator of cell death, may be a tumor suppressor
gene subject to loss or inactivation in tumors.

MAPPING

Kissil and Kimchi (1997) mapped the DAP3 gene to chromosome 1q21 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Verification of the assignment was
achieved by identifying the gene in a YAC contig encompassing chromosome
1q21.1-q21.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hirota et al. (2004) found a strong association between bronchial asthma
(600807) in adults and SNPs in the DAP3 gene (p = 0.0051; OR = 1.87; 95%
CI = 1.20-2.92), but no association with childhood asthma. The tendency
was more prominent in patients with high serum total immunoglobulin E
(IgE; 147180). DAP3 was found to be expressed in normal bronchial
epithelial cells, and that expression was induced by IFNG.

186946	TITLE *186946 FK506-BINDING PROTEIN 2; FKBP2
;;FK506-BINDING PROTEIN, T-CELL, 13-KD; FKBP13
DESCRIPTION For background information on FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), see FKBP1A
(186945).

CLONING

Jin et al. (1991) reported the cloning and subcellular localization of a
13-kD FK506-binding protein (FKBP13), which has a 21-amino acid signal
peptide and appears to be membrane-associated. The 120-amino acid mature
protein appears to lack a transmembrane domain but a potential
endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence (arg-thr-glu-leu) is found at
its C terminus. FKBP13 shares 51% nucleotide sequence identity and 43%
amino acid sequence identity with FKBP12 (FKBP1; 186945), the
predominant FK506- and rapamycin-binding protein in human T cells. Jin
et al. (1991) noted that conserved residues that comprise the drug
binding site and rotamase active site of FKBP12 are completely conserved
in FKBP13.

GENE STRUCTURE

DiLella et al. (1992) found that the FKBP2 gene is 3 kb long and
contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, DiLella et al. (1992) mapped the
FKBP2 gene to 11q13.1-q13.3.

Courseaux et al. (1996) used a combination of methods to refine maps of
the approximately 5-Mb region of 11q13 that includes MEN1 (131100). They
proposed the following gene order:
cen--PGA--FTH1--UGB--AHNAK--ROM1--MDU1--CHRM1--COX8--EMK1--FKBP2--PLCB3--[PYGM,
ZFM1]--FAU--CAPN1--[MLK3, RELA]--FOSL1--SEA--CFL1--tel.

612609	TITLE *612609 LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE PROTEIN 2A; LCE2A
;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 9; LEP9
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE2A,
which they called LEP9.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) detected LCE2A expression in
human fetal, arm, penal, and abdominal skin. Much weaker expression was
detected in vulva, but not in tongue or esophagus.

GENE FUNCTION

Jackson et al. (2005) showed that expression of LCE2 genes, including
LCE2A, was upregulated in cultured normal human keratinocytes by both
ultraviolet irradiation and calcium.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that the LCE2A gene contains 2 exons.
Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE2A
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) stated that the mouse Lce2a gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene
cluster on chromosome 3F1.

601204	TITLE *601204 PROSTAGLANDIN F2 RECEPTOR NEGATIVE REGULATOR; PTGFRN
;;FP REGULATORY PROTEIN; FPRP;;
CD9 PARTNER 1; CD9P1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Orlicky et al. (1996) isolated a protein that copurifies with bovine
prostaglandin F(2-alpha) receptor (PTGFR; 600563) and cloned the
corresponding rat cDNA. Transfection experiments suggested that this
protein, which the authors designated FP regulatory protein (FPRP),
inhibits binding of PGF(2-alpha) to PTGFR. Histologically, FPRP showed a
distribution coinciding well with those cells and tissues that respond
to PGF(2-alpha).

By screening cDNA libraries for sequences with the potential to encode
large proteins expressed in brain, Nagase et al. (2000) identified a
cDNA encoding FPRP, which they termed KIAA1436. The deduced 924-amino
acid protein was predicted to be 89% identical to rat Fprp. RT-PCR
analysis detected wide expression that was highest in ovary and lung.

By mass spectrometric and flow cytometric analyses of an
immunoprecipitated protein, CD9P1, that interacts with CD9 (143030) and
is expressed in HeLa cells, Charrin et al. (2001) determined that CD9P1
is identical to KIAA1436. SDS-PAGE analysis showed expression of a
135-kD protein under reducing conditions, which was lowered to 125 kD
and 106 kD by sialidase and N-glycanase treatments, respectively.
Further immunoprecipitation analysis showed that CD9P1 interacts with
CD81 (186845). Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated expression in
keratinocytes and, faintly, in salivary glands, but not in other
tissues. In contrast, CD9P1 was strongly expressed in a number of cancer
cell lines, suggesting a possible upregulation during tumorigenesis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Stipp et al. (2001) used moderately stringent Brij96/97 detergent
extraction to show that FPRP associates specifically with CD81 and CD9
but not with other tetraspanin molecules, such as CD151 (602243). They
determined that nearly all cell surface FPRP is associated with CD9 and
CD81.

MAPPING

Orlicky et al. (1996) subcloned and sequenced a portion of the 3-prime
untranslated region of the human homolog to FPRP, and oligonucleotide
primers were designed that allowed PCR amplification specifically of the
human FPRP sequence. Using these primers for PCR-based mapping, the FPRP
gene was localized to chromosome 1 through analysis of human/rodent
somatic cell hybrids and to 1p13.1-q21.3 by analysis of YAC pools.

610971	TITLE *610971 TRAFFICKING PROTEIN PARTICLE COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 4; TRAPPC4
;;SYNBINDIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ethell et al. (2000) cloned mouse Trappc4, which they called synbindin.
The deduced 219-amino acid protein contains segments of homology with
proteins involved in vesicular transport or synaptic function, including
a nonclassical PDZ domain, followed by a TRAPPC1 (610969)-like domain,
and a C-terminal tail similar to a short cytoplasmic segment of RYR2
(180902). By database analysis, Ethell et al. (2000) identified human
synbindin, which also encodes a 219-amino acid protein. Northern blot
analysis of several mouse tissues detected highest expression in liver
and skeletal muscle, followed by kidney, heart, and brain. RT-PCR, in
situ hybridization, and immunohistochemical analysis detected strong
synbindin expression in differentiated neurons. In adult mouse CNS,
expression was highest in large neurons such as pyramidal neurons,
Purkinje cells, and motor neurons and weak or undetectable in smaller
granule-type neurons. Immunogold electron microscopy of adult mouse
cerebral cortex detected synbindin predominantly in postsynaptic
membranes and postsynaptic densities, intracellular vesicles in the
dendritic shaft, membrane cisternae, and in the Golgi apparatus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid experiments, coimmunoprecipitation assays, and in
vitro pull-down assays, Ethell et al. (2000) demonstrated that mouse
synbindin interacted directly with rat syndecan-2 (SDC2; 142460). Yeast
2-hybrid analysis also showed that synbindin interacted with rat
syndecan-4 (SDC4; 600017). Mutation analysis showed that the interaction
required the PDZ-like domain of synbindin and the EFYA motif in the
C-terminal domain of Sdc2. Primary rat hippocampal neurons transfected
with synbindin and Sdc2 expressed the proteins in clusters along
dendritic spines. Sdc2 lacking the EFYA motif formed clusters that
lacked synbindin, suggesting synbindin clustering was dependent on Sdc2.
Ethell et al. (2000) concluded that synbindin has a role in postsynaptic
membrane trafficking.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TRAPPC4
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP WI-20793).

135940	TITLE *135940 FILAGGRIN; FLG
PROFILAGGRIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Profilaggrin is a major protein component of the keratohyalin granules
of mammalian epidermis. It is initially expressed as a large polyprotein
precursor which is subsequently proteolytically processed into
individual functional filaggrin molecules. The filaggrins show wide
species variations and their aberrant expression has been implicated in
a number of keratinizing disorders (Baden et al., 1974; Holbrook et al.,
1982; Sybert et al., 1985).

CLONING

McKinley-Grant et al. (1989) isolated a cDNA clone encoding human
filaggrin. They demonstrated that the human gene encodes a polyprotein
precursor containing numerous tandem filaggrin repeats. This structure
is similar to that of the mouse; however, the human filaggrin repeat is
much longer (972 basepairs; 324 amino acids) and shows little sequence
homology to the mouse protein. They found furthermore that the human
filaggrin repeats show considerable sequence variations; such
polymorphism is not found in the mouse. By peptide mapping, they defined
a short linker sequence within the human filaggrin repeat that is
excised by proteolysis to yield functional molecules. They showed by in
situ hybridization that the expression of the gene for the human
filaggrin precursor is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level in
terminally differentiating epidermis.

Gan et al. (1990) isolated genomic DNA and cDNA clones encoding the
5-prime and 3-prime ends of the human gene and mRNA. They found evidence
of likely CAT and TATA sequences, an intron in the 5-prime untranslated
region, and several potential regulatory sequences. The gene is made up
of repeats, all of the same length. Sequences showed considerable
variation, most attributable to single-base changes. Thus, human
filaggrin consists of a heterogeneous population of molecules of
different sizes, charges, and sequences. Amino acid sequences encoding
the amino and carboxyl termini were more conserved, as were the 5-prime
and 3-prime DNA sequences flanking the coding portions of the gene. The
presence of unique restriction enzyme sites in these conserved flanking
sequences enabled Gan et al. (1990) to calculate the size of the
full-length gene and the number of repeats in it; depending on the
source of genomic DNA, the gene contains 10, 11, or 12 filaggrin repeats
that segregate in families in a normal mendelian manner. Thus, the human
profilaggrin gene is polymorphic with respect to size due to simple
allelic differences between individuals.

GENE STRUCTURE

The FLG gene comprises 3 exons (Presland et al., 1992).

MAPPING

Using a cDNA clone as a probe in the study of a panel of mouse-human
somatic cell hybrids retaining overlapping subsets of human chromosomal
regions and for chromosomal in situ hybridization, McKinley-Grant et al.
(1989) demonstrated that the human filaggrin gene maps to 1q21.
Rothnagel et al. (1994) mapped the homologous gene to mouse chromosome 3
by PCR analyses of DNAs isolated from mouse/Chinese hamster somatic cell
hybrids.

Genes of 3 protein families that are specifically expressed in the
course of terminal differentiation of human epidermis have been mapped
to 1q21. Volz et al. (1993) showed that these genes are physically
linked within 2.05 Mb of DNA in the following order: calpactin I light
chain (CAL1L; 114085), trichohyalin (THL; 190370), profilaggrin,
involucrin (IVL; 147360), small proline-rich protein (SPRR1A; 182265),
loricrin (LOR; 152445), and calcyclin (CACY; 114110).

GENE FUNCTION

Smith et al. (2006) reviewed the function of filaggrin, also known as
filament-aggregating protein, in the formation of the stratum corneum.
Keratohyalin granules in the granular layer of interfollicular epidermis
are predominantly composed of the 400-kD protein profilaggrin. Following
a short, unique N-terminal domain, most of the profilaggrin molecule
consists of 10 to 12 repeats of the 324-residue filaggrin sequence (Gan
et al., 1990). Upon terminal differentiation of granular cells,
profilaggrin is proteolytically cleaved into filaggrin peptides of
approximately 37 kD and the N-terminal domain containing an S100-like
calcium-binding domain. Filaggrin rapidly aggregates the keratin
cytoskeleton, causing collapse of the granular cells into flattened
anuclear squames. This condensed cytoskeleton is crosslinked by
transglutaminases during formation of the cornified cell envelope (CCE).
The CCE is the outermost barrier layer of the skin which not only
prevents water loss but also impedes the entry of allergens and
infectious agents. Filaggrin is therefore a key protein in facilitating
epidermal differentiation and maintaining barrier function.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 15 kindreds with ichthyosis vulgaris (146700), Smith et al. (2006)
identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations R501X
(135940.0001) and 2282del4 (135940.0002) in the FLG gene in individuals
with a moderate or severe phenotype. They concluded that these mutations
are semidominant; heterozygotes show a very mild phenotype with
incomplete penetrance. The mutations showed a combined allele frequency
of approximately 4% in populations of European ancestry, explaining the
high incidence of ichthyosis vulgaris. Profilaggrin is the major protein
of keratohyalin granules in the epidermis. During terminal
differentiation, it is cleaved into multiple filaggrin peptides that
aggregate keratin filaments. The resultant matrix is crosslinked to form
a major component of the cornified cell envelope. Smith et al. (2006)
found that loss or reduction of this major structural protein leads to
varying degrees of impaired keratinization.

Twin and family studies have indicated a highly heritable predisposition
to atopic disease, including atopic dermatitis (see 603165), allergy,
and asthma (see 600807). Although genetic studies have focused on
immunologic mechanisms of atopic dermatitis, a primary epithelial
barrier defect has been anticipated (Cookson and Moffatt, 2002).
Filaggrin is a key protein that facilitates terminal differentiation of
the epidermis and formation of the skin barrier. Palmer et al. (2006)
showed that 2 independent loss-of-function genetic variants, R501X
(135940.0001) and 2282del4 (135940.0002), in the FLG gene are very
strong predisposing factors for atopic dermatitis (605803). These
mutations had been shown to be the cause of ichthyosis vulgaris in 15
families and isolated cases (Smith et al., 2006). The R501X and 2282del4
variants, carried by approximately 9% of people of European origin, also
showed highly significant association with asthma occurring in the
context of atopic dermatitis. This work established a key role for
impaired skin barrier function in the development of atopic disease.

Sandilands et al. (2007) showed that the 2 common filaggrin-null
mutations reported by Smith et al. (2006) and Palmer et al. (2006) are
ancestral European variants carried on conserved haplotypes. To
facilitate comprehensive analysis in other populations, they reported a
strategy for full sequencing of this large, highly repetitive gene, and
described 15 variants, including 7 that are prevalent. All the variants
were either nonsense or frameshift mutations that, in representative
cases, resulted in loss of filaggrin production in the epidermis. In an
Irish case-control study, the 5 most common European mutations showed a
strong association with moderate to severe childhood eczema. They found
3 additional rare null mutations in this case series, suggesting that
the genetic architecture of filaggrin-related atopic dermatitis consists
of both prevalent and rare risk alleles.

Using the transmission-disequilibrium test in 476 German
parent-offspring trios with atopic dermatitis, Weidinger et al. (2006)
found a significant association between the loss-of-function mutations
R501X and 2282del4 in the FLG gene and extrinsic atopic dermatitis,
allergic sensitization, total IgE level, asthma, and palmar
hyperlinearity; there was no significant association with intrinsic
atopic dermatitis.

Marenholz et al. (2006) genotyped 1092 children with eczema (atopic
dermatitis) from 2 large European populations for the R501X and 2282del4
mutations in the FLG gene and confirmed a highly significant association
between the null mutations and eczema and concomitant asthma. Moreover,
the authors found that these mutations predisposed to asthma, allergic
rhinitis, and allergic sensitization only in the presence of eczema,
highlighting the importance of the epidermal barrier in the pathogenesis
of these disorders (the so-called 'atopic march').

Nomura et al. (2007) sequenced the entire FLG gene in 7 Japanese
patients with ichthyosis vulgaris from 4 unrelated families who were
negative for the R501X and 2282del4 mutations, and identified
heterozygosity for 2 novel mutations, S2554X (135940.0003) and 3321delA
(135940.0004), respectively. The authors then screened 143 Japanese
patients with atopic dermatitis from 140 unrelated families for the
novel null mutations and identified S2554X in 6 patients and 3321delA in
2 patients; they were not found in 156 unrelated Japanese nonatopic and
nonichthyotic controls, yielding a chi-square p value of 0.0015. Noting
that the R501X and 2282del4 mutations were absent from a total of 253
Japanese individuals, including their patients with ichthyosis vulgaris
and atopic dermatitis, Nomura et al. (2007) concluded that FLG mutations
in Japan are different from those found in European-origin populations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Netherton syndrome (256500) is an autosomal recessive multisystemic
disorder characterized by congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, hair
shaft defects and atopy, caused by mutation in the SPINK5 gene (605010).
Hewett et al. (2005) created mice with an R820X mutation in the Spink5
gene. Newborn homozygotes developed a severe ichthyosis with a loss of
skin barrier function and dehydration, resulting in death within a few
hours. Biochemical analysis of skin revealed a substantial increase in
the proteolytic processing of profilaggrin into its constituent
filaggrin monomers. The authors suggested that in the absence of SPINK5
there is an abnormal increase in the processing of profilaggrin, and
that this may play a direct role in the observed deficit in the adhesion
of the stratum corneum and the severely compromised epidermal barrier
function.

Fallon et al. (2009) reported a 1-bp deletion mutation, 5303delA,
analogous to common human FLG mutations, within the murine Flg gene in
the spontaneous mouse mutant 'flaky tail' (ft). Fallon et al. (2009)
demonstrated that topical application of allergen to mice homozygous for
this mutation resulted in cutaneous inflammatory infiltrates and
enhanced cutaneous allergen priming with development of
allergen-specific antibody responses. These data validated flaky tail as
a useful model of filaggrin deficiency and provided experimental
evidence for the hypothesis that antigen transfer through a defective
epidermal barrier is a key mechanism underlying elevated IgE
sensitization and initiation of cutaneous inflammation in humans with
filaggrin-related atopic disease.

ICHTHYOSIS VULGARIS
DERMATITIS, ATOPIC, 2, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
FLG, ARG501TER

In 7 unrelated ichthyosis vulgaris (146700) families and 8 additional
'sporadic' cases from Ireland, Scotland, and the U.S., Smith et al.
(2006) found that ichthyosis vulgaris was associated with an
arg501-to-stop (R501X) mutation arising from a 1501C-to-T transition
near the start of repeat 1 in exon 3 of the FLG gene. In 3 families,
ichthyosis vulgaris patients with a very pronounced phenotype were
homozygous for R501X. In other families and isolated cases, they found
individuals with the marked ichthyosis vulgaris phenotype to be compound
heterozygous for R501X and a second mutation, 2282del4, in exon 3
(135940.0002).

Ichthyosis vulgaris is semidominant: that is, heterozygotes had either
no discernible phenotype or milder ichthyosis, whereas homozygotes or
compound heterozygotes had marked ichthyosis and an overt histologic
skin barrier defect. In an extension of the work of Smith et al. (2006),
Palmer et al. (2006) noted that in their families with ichthyosis
vulgaris, many individuals null or heterozygous for filaggrin also had
atopic dermatitis (605803) (eczema) and, in a few cases, also had asthma
(see 600807). Specifically, atopic dermatitis was prevalent in the
individuals with mild ichthyosis vulgaris, all of whom were heterozygous
for either the R501X or 2282del4 FLG-null allele (13/29; 44%). Atopic
dermatitis was particularly common in individuals with severe ichthyosis
vulgaris, all of whom were homozygous or compound heterozygous for
FLG-null alleles (16/21; 76%). None of the individuals in these families
who lacked an FLG-null allele had atopic dermatitis (n = 13). Thus,
atopic dermatitis is inherited as a semidominant trait in these
families, with high penetrance in FLG-null homozygotes or compound
heterozygotes and reduced penetrance in heterozygotes.

Using the transmission-disequilibrium test in 476 German
parent-offspring trios with atopic dermatitis, Weidinger et al. (2006)
found a significant association between the loss-of-function mutations
R501X and 2282del4 in the FLG gene and extrinsic atopic dermatitis,
allergic sensitization, total IgE level, asthma, and palmar
hyperlinearity; there was no significant association with intrinsic
atopic dermatitis.

Marenholz et al. (2006) genotyped 1092 children with eczema (atopic
dermatitis) from 2 large European populations for the R501X and 2282del4
mutations in the FLG gene and replicated the highly significant
association between the null mutations and eczema and concomitant
asthma. Moreover, the authors found that these mutations predisposed to
asthma, allergic rhinitis, and allergic sensitization only in the
presence of eczema, and that the mutations predisposed equally to atopic
(intrinsic) and nonatopic (extrinsic) forms of eczema. They demonstrated
that the presence of 2 null alleles is an independent risk factor for
asthma in children with eczema (OR, 11.76, p = 0.0085). Together, the 2
mutations accounted for approximately 11% of eczema cases in the German
population.

FLG, 4-BP DEL, 2282CAGT

See 135940.0001 and Smith et al. (2006). The 2282del4 mutation leads to
a premature termination codon 107 bp downstream and, like R501X, stops
protein translation within the first filaggrin repeat.

Palmer et al. (2006) found an association of the 2282del4 and R501X
genetic variants of the FLG gene with atopic dermatitis; see
135940.0001.

Weidinger et al. (2006) found a significant association between atopic
dermatitis, in particular the extrinsic type, and the R501X and 2282del4
mutations; Marenholz et al. (2006) replicated the association and also
found that the presence of 2 null alleles was an independent risk factor
for asthma in children with eczema. See 135940.0001.

ICHTHYOSIS VULGARIS

FLG, SER2554TER

In affected members of 2 unrelated Japanese families with ichthyosis
vulgaris (146700) who were negative for previously identified null
mutations in the FLG gene, Nomura et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 7661C-G transversion in exon 3 of the FLG gene,
resulting in a ser2554-to-ter (S2554X) substitution, predicted to cause
premature termination of profilaggrin translation in the filaggrin
repeat domain 7. The older sister of 1 proband, who had a severe
presentation of the disease, was found to be homozygous for S2554X. The
authors then screened 143 Japanese patients with atopic dermatitis
(605803) from 140 unrelated families for this null mutation and
identified S2554X in 6 patients. The mutation was not found in 156
unrelated nonatopic and nonichthyotic Japanese controls.

In 2 probands from 2 unrelated Japanese families with ichthyosis
vulgaris (146700), who were negative for previously identified null
mutations in the FLG gene, Nomura et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (3321delA) in exon 3 of the FLG gene,
resulting in a premature termination of profilaggrin translation in
filaggrin repeat domain 2. The authors then screened 143 Japanese
patients with atopic dermatitis (605803) from 140 unrelated families for
this deletion and identified 3321delA in 2 patients. The deletion was
not found in 156 unrelated nonatopic and nonichthyotic Japanese
controls.
