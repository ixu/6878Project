DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the secretoglobin family, such as SCGB2A1, are secreted
proteins of about 10 kD that are found in high concentrations in fluids
of lung, lacrimal gland, salivary gland, prostate, uterus, and other
tissues. Secretoglobins form stable dimers prior to secretion (summary
by Jackson et al., 2011).

CLONING

The uteroglobin gene family includes the uteroglobin (UGB; 192020) and
mammaglobin (MGB) genes. By screening a human genomic library with an
MGB gene fragment, Becker et al. (1998) isolated a segment of a novel
gene showing high sequence similarity to MGB. Based on this similarity,
they named the novel gene mammaglobin B, which is also called
mammaglobin-2 (MGB2). The authors isolated a full-length MGB2 cDNA by
RACE PCR using mRNA from a human breast cancer cell line. The predicted
95-amino acid MGB2 protein contains the conserved residues
characteristic of the uteroglobin family. MGB2 shares 58% amino acid
sequence identity with MGB and 23% identity with UGB. Becker et al.
(1998) found that MGB2 is identical to a 68-amino acid peptide of
lacryglobin, a human tear protein identified and sequenced by Molloy et
al. (1997), except that MGB2 contains 18 additional amino acids at the N
terminus and 9 additional amino acids at the C terminus. Becker et al.
(1998) suggested that the 18 N-terminal amino acids are cleaved prior to
secretion from the lacrimal gland and that the 9 amino acids at the C
terminus represent amino acids not identified in the lacryglobin
fragment sequenced. RNA dot blot analysis found MGB2 expression in
normal human breast, uterus, and salivary gland, but not in prostate or
stomach. Northern blot analysis detected MGB2 expression in normal
breast and breast tumor samples, with an apparent overexpression in
tumor samples compared with patient-matched normal samples. Northern
blot analysis of uterus samples showed MGB2 expression in 2 of 8 normal
samples and 2 of 8 tumor samples.

Zhao et al. (1999) cloned SCGB2A1, which they called lipophilin C, from
a human lacrimal gland cDNA library. The deduced 95-amino acid
prelipophilin C protein has a calculated molecular mass of 10.9 kD.
Removal of the N-terminal signal sequence yields a mature 77-amino acid
protein with a predicted molecular mass of 8.9 kD. RT-PCR detected
lipophilin C expression in thymus, prostate, testis, salivary gland,
kidney, trachea, uterus, mammary gland, ovary, and lacrimal gland.
Little to no expression was present in skeletal muscle, small intestine,
spleen, placenta, bone marrow, and leukocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Becker et al. (1998) determined that the MGB2 gene contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Becker et al. (1998) mapped the MGB2 gene to 11q13, which is
where the MGB and UGB genes are located. Independently, Zhao et al.
(1999) mapped the SCGB2A1 gene to chromosome 11q12-q13.1 using FISH.
