DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as miRNA19B2, are 20- to 23-nucleotide RNAs
that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally by mediating
sequence-specific repression of mRNA translation (Lagos-Quintana et al.,
2001).

CLONING

Using a directional cloning procedure to identify miRNAs from HeLa cell
total RNA, Lagos-Quintana et al. (2001) cloned miRNA19B2.

GENE FUNCTION

Mourelatos et al. (2002) identified miRNA19B2 as 1 of at least 40 miRNAs
present in a large 15S ribonucleoprotein complex containing EIF2C2
(606229), GEMIN3 (606168), and GEMIN4 (606969).

Using RT-PCR, Mavrakis et al. (2011) analyzed the expression of 430
miRNAs in 50 clinical T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL; see
613065) specimens representing 7 cytogenetic groups and in 18 T-ALL cell
lines. They identified 10 miRNAs that accounted for most detectable
miRNAs in T-ALL cells, 5 of which, MIR19B, MIR20A (609420), MIR26A (see
612151), MIR92 (see 609422), and MIR223 (300694), were predicted to
target tumor suppressor genes. All 5 of these miRNAs accelerated
leukemia development in a mouse model. These 5 miRNAs also produced
overlapping and cooperative effects on tumor suppressors implicated in
T-ALL pathogenesis, including IKAROS (IKZF1; 603023), PTEN (601728), BIM
(BCL2L11; 603827), PHF6 (300414), NF1 (162200), and FBXW7 (606278).

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lagos-Quintana et al. (2001) mapped the
MIRN19B2 gene to the X chromosome. Mourelatos et al. (2002) determined
that the MIRN19B2 gene is clustered with the MIRN92A2 gene within a
250-nucleotide region of the X chromosome.

Gross (2008) mapped the MIRN19B2 gene to chromosome Xq26.2 based on an
alignment of the MIRN19B2 stem-loop sequence
(ACAUUGCUACUUACAAUUAGUUUUGCAGGUUUGCAUUUCAGCGUAUAUAUGUAUAUGUGGCUGUGCAAAUCCAUGCAAAACUGAUUGUGAUAAUGU)
with the genomic sequence (build 36.1).

615036	TITLE *615036 MICRO RNA 410; MIR410
;;miRNA410
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Micro RNAs (miRNAs), such as MIR410, are small noncoding RNAs that
downregulate gene expression by promoting mRNA degradation or preventing
mRNA translation via sequence-specific interactions with target RNAs
(Gattolliat et al., 2011).

GENE FUNCTION

A combination of age at diagnosis, stage of disease, and amplification
of the MYCN gene (164840) define high- and low-risk neuroblastomas (see
256700). Using microarray expression profiling and quantitative RT-PCR,
Gattolliat et al. (2011) found that 15 of 17 miRNAs significantly
downregulated in high-risk neuroblastomas originated from a large miRNA
cluster on chromosome 14q. Of these, MIR410 and MIR487B (615037)
exhibited the highest fold change and discriminated high-risk from
low-risk neuroblastomas. Compared with high-risk neuroblastomas,
low-risk neuroblastomas showed expression of both MIR410 and MIR487B,
and MIR410 and MIR487B expression favored overall and disease-free
survival. No loss of copy number at this locus was found in high-risk
neuroblastomas, suggesting that downregulation of these miRNAs was
likely the result of transcriptional or processing regulation.

Richardson et al. (2013) found that MIR410 is a regulator of lipoprotein
lipase (LPL; 609708) and that the minor allele C of the SNP dbSNP
rs13702 in LPL (609708.0043) abolishes the response of a functional
MIR410 recognition element in the LPL 3-prime untranslated region.

MAPPING

Gattolliat et al. (2011) stated that the MIR410 gene maps to a large
miRNA cluster on chromosome 14q32.31.

;;miRNA181B2;;
MIRN181B2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIR181B, are short noncoding RNAs that
repress translation or induce cleavage of target mRNAs with which they
interact (Ciafre et al., 2005). Two distinct genes, MIR181B1 (612744)
and MIR181B2, encode the same mature MIR181B miRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Using microarray and Northern blot analyses, Ciafre et al. (2005) found
that expression of MIR181B was significantly downregulated in primary
glioblastomas and human glioblastoma cell lines compared with normal
brain tissue.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the MIR181B2 gene to chromosome 9q33.3 based on an
alignment of the MIR181B2 stem-loop sequence
(CUGAUGGCUGCACUCAACAUUCAUUGCUGUCGGUGGGUUUGAGUCUGAAUCAACUCACUGAUCAAUGAAUG
CAAACUGCGGACCAAACA) with the genomic sequence (build 36.1).

613753	TITLE *613753 MICRO RNA 211; MIR211
;;miRNA211;;
MIRN211
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIR211, are small noncoding RNAs that
commonly basepair with sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of target mRNAs and
either inhibit mRNA translation or cause mRNA destabilization (Krol et
al., 2010).

CLONING

Krol et al. (2010) found that Mir211, Mir204 (610942), and the Mir183
(611608)/Mir96 (611606)/Mir182 (611607) cluster were highly expressed in
mouse retina. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that expression of Mir204 and
Mir211 was enriched in the microdissected inner nuclear layer, whereas
the Mir183/Mir9/Mir182 cluster was most abundant in photoreceptors.

GENE FUNCTION

Using expression arrays and quantitative RT-PCR, Krol et al. (2010)
showed that expression of Mir211, Mir204, and the Mir183/Mir96/Mir182
cluster was reversibly up- and downregulated in mouse retina during
light and dark adaptation, respectively. Increased accumulation of these
miRNAs upon light adaptation occurred independently of circadian rhythm.
The half-lives of these and other miRNAs appeared to be much shorter in
retinal neurons than in rod bipolar cells or Muller glia cells. Similar
rapid miRNA decay was observed in cultured rodent neurons and mouse
embryonic stem cell-derived neurons. Inhibitor studies revealed that
miRNA turnover was stimulated by neuronal activity.

Chen et al. (2010) found that miR211 regulates the vascular endothelial
growth factor angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1; 601667).

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the MIR211 gene to chromosome 15q13.3 based on an
alignment of the mature MIR211 sequence (UUCCCUUUGUCAUCCUUCGCCU) with
the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Krol et al. (2010) noted that the mouse Mir211 gene is located within an
intron of the Trpm1 gene (603576).

300810	TITLE *300810 MICRO RNA 98; MIR98
;;miRNA98;;
MIRN98
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIR98, are endogenous noncoding RNAs of
about 22 nucleotides that bind complementary sequences within the
3-prime UTRs of target mRNAs, leading to translational repression and/or
mRNA cleavage (Hu et al., 2009).

CLONING

Mourelatos et al. (2002) identified MIR98 as 1 of at least 40 miRNAs
present in a large 15S RNP complex containing EIF2C2 (606229), GEMIN3
(606168), and GEMIN4 (606969). The MIR98 sequence is
UGAGGUAGUAAGUUGUAUUGUU.

GENE FUNCTION

Hu et al. (2009) noted that miRNAs have been implicated in the fine
tuning of the Toll-like receptor (TLR; see 603030)-mediated inflammatory
response. Using Northern and Western blot analyses and PCR with human
cholangiocytes, which express multiple TLRs, Hu et al. (2009) showed
that MIR98 and LET7 (see MIRNLET7A1; 605386) regulated CIS (CISH;
602441) protein expression via translational suppression. CIS expression
was upregulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Cryptosporidium parvum
exposure, and this upregulation involved downregulation of MIR98 and
LET7, which relieved MIR98- and LET7-mediated translational repression
of CIS. Gain- and loss-of-function studies showed that CIS accelerated
degradation of IKBA (NFKBIA; 164008) and enhanced NFKB (see 164011)
activation in cholangiocytes in response to LPS stimulation or C. parvum
exposure.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Mourelatos et al. (2002) mapped the MIR98
gene to chromosome X.
