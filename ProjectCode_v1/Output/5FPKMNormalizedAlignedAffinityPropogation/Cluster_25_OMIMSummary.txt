MIRN125B1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs, such as MIR125B, are small noncoding RNAs that regulate
target gene expression posttranscriptionally through basepairing with
their target mRNAs. MIR125B1 and MIR125B2 (610105) both encode
precursors of the same mature MIR125B sequence, but the precursors
differ in the sequences flanking the mature MIR125B sequence (Lee et
al., 2005).

CLONING

Using synthetic siRNAs designed against the loop region of both MIR125B1
and MIR125B2, Lee et al. (2005) determined that MIR125B2 was the source
of most of the miR125b they detected in human cell lines.

Using quantitative real-time PCR, Sonkoly et al. (2007) found ubiquitous
but variable expression of miR125B in human tissues. Highest expression
was in prostate, heart, cervix, brain, and bladder.

GENE FUNCTION

Using microarray analysis, Ciafre et al. (2005) found that expression of
MIR125B1 was significantly upregulated in primary glioblastomas compared
with normal peripheral brain tissue.

Using microarray analysis, van Rooij et al. (2006) identified miR125B
among a group of miRNAs upregulated in 2 independent mouse models of
cardiac hypertrophy. Northern blot analysis showed increased expression
of miR125B in idiopathic end-stage failing human hearts.

Laneve et al. (2007) found that MIRN9 (see 611186), MIRN125A (611191),
and MIRN125B were upregulated in a human neuroblastoma cell line by
retinoic acid. They identified the mRNA encoding t-NTRK3, a truncated
isoform of NTRK3 (191316), as a target of the 3 miRNAs. The 3-prime UTR
of the t-NTRK3 transcript has a binding site for MIRN9 and another for
both MIRN125A and MIRN125B, which share the same seed sequence. These
miRNAs repressed t-NTRK3 expression in an additive manner, and
downregulation of t-NTRK3 was critical for regulating neuroblastoma cell
growth. Consistent with their function, MIRN9, MIRN125A, and MIRN125B
were downmodulated in primary neuroblastoma tumors.

Using microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR, Sonkoly et al.
(2007) found that expression of miR125B was decreased in psoriasis (see
177900) and atopic eczema (see 603165) compared with normal human skin.

To investigate the functional consequences of heterozygous mutations in
ATM (607585), homozygous mutations in which cause ataxia-telangiectasia
(AT; 208900), Smirnov and Cheung (2008) compared the gene and microRNA
expression phenotypes of noncarriers, AT carriers, and AT patients. The
authors found that some expression phenotypes are more similar between
noncarriers and AT carriers compared to AT patients, as expected for a
recessive disorder. However, for some expression phenotypes, AT carriers
are more similar to the patients than to the noncarriers. Analysis of
one of these expression phenotypes, TNFSF4 (603594) level, allowed
Smirnov and Cheung (2008) to uncover a regulatory pathway in which ATM
regulates TNFSF4 expression through MIRN125B. In AT carriers and AT
patients, this pathway is disrupted. As a result, the level of MIRN125B
is lower and the level of its target gene, TNFSF4, is higher than in
noncarriers. A decreased level of MIRN125B is associated with breast
cancer, and an elevated level of TNFSF4 is associated with
atherosclerosis. Thus, Smirnov and Cheung (2008) concluded that their
findings provided a mechanistic suggestion for the increased risk of
breast cancer and heart disease in AT carriers.

Le et al. (2009) identified highly conserved miRNA response elements in
the 3-prime UTRs of zebrafish and human p53 (TP53; 191170) transcripts
and showed that MIR125B bound directly to these elements. MIR125B
repressed translation of endogenous p53, reduced expression of p53
target genes, and countered drug-induced apoptosis in human cells.
Knockdown of mir125b in zebrafish embryos resulted in severe
developmental defects, particularly accumulation of dead cells in the
brain, and loss of mir125b increased p53 protein and p53-dependent
apoptosis. Treatment of zebrafish embryos with DNA-damaging agents
resulted in downregulation of mir125b and a rapid increase in p53
protein. Le et al. (2009) concluded that MIR125B is an important
negative regulator of p53 and p53-induced apoptosis during development
and during the stress response.

MAPPING

Lee et al. (2005) stated that the MIRN125B1 gene maps to chromosome 11
and is located in the exon of an uncharacterized gene.

Ciafre et al. (2005) stated that the MIR125B1 gene maps to chromosome
11q24.1, where it lies in a cluster with the LET7A2 (612142) and MIR100
(613186) genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Bousquet et al. (2010) found that inoculation of mice with
Mir125b-overexpressing hematopoietic mouse fetal liver cells resulted in
an elevated number of neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes and
macrocytic anemia. Within 12 to 29 weeks posttansplantation, half of the
inoculated mice succumbed to a hematologic malignancy, including
myeloproliferative neoplasm, B-cell acute lymphoid leukemia (B-ALL), and
T-cell acute lymphoid leukemia (T-ALL). The type of leukemia appeared to
be related to the level of Mir125b expression, with lower expression in
T-ALL and higher expression in myeloid neoplasm. Overexpression of
Mir125b also accelerated the development of BCR (151410)/ABL
(189980)-induced leukemia in mice.

604064	TITLE *604064 ACTIVATING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 4; ATF4
;;CYCLIC AMP RESPONSE ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 2; CREB2;;
TAX-RESPONSIVE ENHANCER ELEMENT B67; TAXREB67
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATF4 belongs to the large ATF/CREB family of transcription factors.
These proteins bind DNA via their basic region and dimerize via their
leucine zipper domain to form a variety of homo- and heterodimers to
regulate gene transcription (De Angelis et al., 2003).

CLONING

An activating transcription factor (ATF)-binding site is a promoter
element present in a wide variety of viral and cellular genes, including
E1A-inducible adenoviral genes and cAMP-inducible cellular genes. Hai et
al. (1989) identified cDNAs encoding 8 different human ATF
consensus-binding proteins, including a partial cDNA corresponding to
ATF4. They found that members of this family share significant sequence
similarity within a leucine zipper DNA-binding motif and an adjacent
basic region; the proteins show little similarity outside of these
regions.

The cAMP response element (CRE) is an octanucleotide motif that mediates
diverse transcriptional regulatory effects. By screening a Jurkat T-cell
line expression library for the ability to bind CRE, Karpinski et al.
(1992) isolated a full-length cDNA corresponding to ATF4, which they
called CREB2 (CRE-binding protein-2). The predicted protein contains 351
amino acids. Northern blot analysis revealed that the 1.5-kb CREB2 mRNA
was expressed in all human tumor cell lines and mouse organs tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Karpinski et al. (1992) found that, unlike CREB (123810), which
activates transcription from CRE-containing promoters, CREB2 functions
as a specific repressor of CRE-dependent transcription. The
transcriptional repressor activity resides within the C-terminal leucine
zipper and basic domain region of the CREB2 protein.

The p40tax gene product of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)
activates HTLV-1 viral transcription in trans through tax-responsive
enhancers in the long terminal repeats. Tsujimoto et al. (1991)
identified ATF4 as TAXREB67, a protein that binds to the tax-responsive
enhancer element in HTLV-1.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, He et al. (2001) found that mouse Nrf2
(NFE2L2; 600492) interacted with rat Atf4. Coimmunoprecipitation and
mammalian 2-hybrid analyses confirmed the interaction. An Nrf2-Atf4
dimer bound a stress response element (StRE) sequence from an Nrf2
target gene, Ho1 (HMOX1; 141250). CdCl2, an Ho1 inducer, increased
expression of Atf4 in mouse hepatoma cells prior to induction of Ho1. A
dominant-negative Atf4 mutant inhibited basal and CdCl2-induced
expression of an StRE-dependent construct in hepatoma cells, but it only
inhibited basal expression in a human mammary epithelial cell line. He
et al. (2001) concluded that ATF4 regulates HO1 expression in a
cell-specific manner, possibly in a complex with NRF2.

Siu et al. (2002) presented evidence that ATF4 binds nutrient-sensing
response element-1 (NSRE1) in the human asparagine synthetase (ASNS;
108370) gene and activates ASNS transcription in response to nutrient
stress.

Bagheri-Yarmand et al. (2003) found that expression of Atf4 was high in
virgin mouse mammary glands and in pregnant mammary glands, but it was
dramatically reduced during lactation and higher after weaning.
Transgenic mice overexpressing Atf4 in mammary epithelium showed
decreased proliferation and impaired differentiation of alveolar
epithelial cells during pregnancy and lactation. In addition, Atf4
overexpression induced apoptosis and accelerated involution of the
mammary gland, suggesting a role for ATF4 in the regulation of normal
mammary gland involution.

De Angelis et al. (2003) showed that human ATF4 and RBP3 (E2F1; 189971)
dimerized in vitro and in vivo and that RBP3 enhanced ATF4
transactivating activity. Expression of both proteins increased during
differentiation of a mouse myogenic cell line.

ATF4 has 2 upstream ORFs (uORFs) that are conserved in vertebrates. The
more 3-prime uORF, uORF2, extends into the coding region of full-length
ATF4. Independently, Lu et al. (2004) and Vattem and Wek (2004) found
that scanning ribosomes initiated translation at both uORFs of mouse
Atf4, and that ribosomes that translated uORF1 efficiently reinitiated
translation at downstream AUGs. In unstressed mouse fibroblasts, low
levels of phosphorylated Eif2 (see EIF2S1; 603907) favored early
capacitation of reinitiating ribosomes, directing them to the inhibitory
uORF2 downstream of uORF1, which precluded translation of Atf4 and
repressed the integrated stress response. In stressed cells, high levels
of phosphorylated Eif2 delayed capacitation of reinitiating ribosomes,
favoring reinitiation at the Atf4 coding sequence over uORF2, which
permitted Atf4 expression and activated the integrated stress response.

Using Rsk2 (300075) -/- mice, Yang et al. (2004) showed that RSK2 is
required for osteoblast differentiation and function. They identified
the transcription factor ATF4 as a critical substrate of RSK2 that is
required for the timely onset of osteoblast differentiation, for
terminal differentiation of osteoblasts, and for osteoblast-specific
gene expression. Additionally, RSK2 and ATF4 were found to
posttranscriptionally regulate the synthesis of type I collagen (see
120150), the main constituent of the bone matrix. Accordingly, Atf4
deficiency in mice resulted in delayed bone formation during embryonic
development and low bone mass throughout postnatal life. Yang et al.
(2004) concluded that ATF4 is a critical regulator of osteoblast
differentiation and function and that lack of ATF4 phosphorylation by
RSK2 may contribute to the skeletal phenotype of Coffin-Lowry syndrome
(303600).

Blais et al. (2004) determined that EIF2-alpha (EIF2S1), PERK (EIF2AK3;
604032), ATF4, and GADD34 (PPP1R15A; 611048) are involved in an
integrated adaptive response to hypoxic stress in HeLa cells.

Sayer et al. (2006) performed a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human fetal
brain expression library and identified ATF4 as a direct interaction
partner of CEP290 (NPHP6; 610142). The protein-interaction domains
mapped to the N-terminal third of CEP290, encoded by exons 2 through 21,
and the C-terminal two-thirds of ATF4. To confirm that CEP290 and ATF4
interact physiologically in vivo, Sayer et al. (2006) performed
coimmunoprecipitation experiments using bovine retina extracts.
Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that endogenous ATF4 can be
immunoprecipitated using an antibody to CEP290 but not using a control
IgG. Reverse coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that antibody to
ATF4 can also precipitate endogenous CEP290.

Lin et al. (2010) showed that although Skp2 (601436) inactivation on its
own does not induce cellular senescence, aberrant protooncogenic signals
as well as inactivation of tumor suppressor genes do trigger a potent,
tumor-suppressive senescence response in mice and cells devoid of Skp2.
Notably, Skp2 inactivation and oncogenic stress-driven senescence
neither elicit activation of the p19(Arf) (see 600160)-p53 (191170)
pathway nor DNA damage, but instead depend on Aft4, p27 (600778), and
p21 (116899). Lin et al. (2010) further demonstrated that genetic Skp2
inactivation evokes cellular senescence even in oncogenic conditions in
which the p19(Arf)-p53 response is impaired, whereas a Skp2-SCF complex
inhibitor can trigger cellular senescence in p53/Pten (601728)-deficient
cells and tumor regression in preclinical studies. Lin et al. (2010)
concluded that their findings provided proof-of-principle evidence that
pharmacologic inhibition of Skp2 may represent a general approach for
cancer prevention and therapy.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ATF4
gene to chromosome 22 (TMAP stSG29796).

ANIMAL MODEL

Tanaka et al. (1998) used gene targeting to generate mice lacking Atf4.
They found that Atf4-deficient mice exhibited severe microphthalmia. The
Atf4-deficient eyes revealed a normal gross lens structure up to
embryonic day 14.5, after which the lens degenerated due to apoptosis
without the formation of lens secondary fiber cells. Retinal development
was normal in the mutant mice. The lens-specific expression of Atf4 in
the mutant mice led not only to the recovery of lens secondary fibers
but also to the induction of hyperplasia of these fibers. Tanaka et al.
(1998) concluded that ATF4 is essential for the later stages of lens
fiber cell differentiation.

NOMENCLATURE

The ATF4 gene, which Karpinski et al. (1992) referred to as CREB2,
should not be confused with the ATF2 gene (123811), which was formerly
known as CREB2.

613147	TITLE *613147 MICRO RNA 205; MIR205
;;miRNA205;;
MIRN205
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIR205, are small noncoding RNAs that
mediate posttranscriptional silencing by binding with partial
complementarity to the 3-prime UTRs of target mRNAs. miRNAs have
important roles in development and differentiation, cellular stress
responses, and cancer (summary by Yu et al., 2008).

GENE FUNCTION

Using the MDCK canine epithelial cell line and a subclone with a
mesenchymal phenotype, Gregory et al. (2008) found that the miR200
family of miRNAs (see 612090) and miR205 regulated expression of Zeb1
(189909) and Zeb2 (605802) and controlled epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition. Furthermore, expression of the miR200 family and miR205 was
lost in invasive human breast cancer cell lines with mesenchymal
phenotype and in primary breast cancer specimens lacking E-cadherin
(CDH1; 192090), an epithelial cell marker.

Using human epithelial cell lines and primary human corneal and
epidermal keratinocytes, Yu et al. (2008) identified SHIP2 (INPPL1;
600829), a lipid phosphatase that functions in the AKT (see 164730)
signaling pathway, as a target of MIR205. They also showed that MIR184
(613146) interfered with the ability of MIR205 to downregulate
expression of SHIP2. A synthetic antagomir targeting MIR205 or ectopic
expression of MIR184 induced SHIP2 expression in keratinocytes, with
coordinated damping of AKT signaling and increased apoptosis.
Examination of the 3-prime UTR of SHIP2 revealed overlapping binding
sites for MIR184 and MIR205. Coexpression of MIR184 with MIR205 reversed
MIR205-induced inhibition of a reporter gene containing the SHIP2
3-prime UTR. MIR184 had no direct effect on SHIP2 expression, but
instead interfered with MIR205 binding to the 3-prime UTR of SHIP2.

MAPPING

Gross (2009) mapped the MIR205 gene to chromosome 1q32.2 based on an
alignment of the mature MIR205 sequence (UCCUUCAUUCCACCGGAGUCUG) with
the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

611191	TITLE *611191 MICRO RNA 125A; MIR125A
;;MIRN125A;;
miRNA125A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIRN125A, are small noncoding RNAs that
control translation of target mRNAs by binding to sites of antisense
complementarity in 3-prime UTRs (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2002).

CLONING

Lagos-Quintana et al. (2002) cloned mouse miRNA125a. Mouse miRNA125a and
miRNA125b (see 610105) differ only by a central diuridine insertion and
a U-to-C change in miRNA125a. Both miRNAs are similar to the C. elegans
lin-4 small temporal RNA. Northern blot analysis detected miRNA125a
expression in all mouse brain regions examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Laneve et al. (2007) found that MIRN9 (see 611186), MIRN125A, and
MIRN125B were upregulated in a human neuroblastoma cell line by retinoic
acid. They identified the mRNA encoding t-NTRK3, a truncated isoform of
NTRK3 (191316), as a target of the 3 miRNAs. The 3-prime UTR of the
t-NTRK3 transcript has a binding site for MIRN9 and another for both
MIRN125A and MIRN125B, which share the same seed sequence. These miRNAs
repressed t-NTRK3 expression in an additive manner, and downregulation
of t-NTRK3 was critical for regulating neuroblastoma cell growth.
Consistent with their function, MIRN9, MIRN125A, and MIRN125B were
downmodulated in primary neuroblastoma tumors.

MAPPING

Duan et al. (2007) stated that the MIR125A gene maps to chromosome
19q13.41.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By searching a human SNP database, Duan et al. (2007) identified a
G-to-U SNP at nucleotide +8 (+8G-U) in the mature MIR125A sequence.
Northern blot and quantitative RT-PCR analyses of transfected HEK293
cells detected the mature form of the major +8G allele of MIR125A, but
not the mature form of the minor +8U allele. The +8G-U SNP was predicted
to introduce a base-pairing mismatch, alter free energy values, and
create an enlarged RNA bulge in pri-MIR125A. In vivo analysis showed
that +8G-U blocked processing of pri-MIR125A to pre-MIR125A. Expression
of a vector containing MIR125A +8G, but not MIR125A +8U, could suppress
a MIR125A target reporter, LIN28 (611043). Duan et al. (2007) concluded
that the +8G-U SNP alters MIR125A processing and reduces
MIR125A-mediated translational suppression.

613117	TITLE *613117 SMALL NUCLEOLAR RNA, C/D BOX, 50A; SNORD50A
;;RNA, U50 SMALL NUCLEOLAR; RNU50;;
snoRNA, U50
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNORD50A belongs to the C/D box class of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs),
which are thought to function as guide RNAs in the site-specific ribose
methylation of preribosomal RNA (Kiss-Laszlo et al., 1996).

CLONING

Kiss-Laszlo et al. (1996) isolated SNORD50A, which they called RNU50,
from a cDNA library of intronic snoRNAs from HeLa cells. RNU50 is 74
nucleotides long.

GENE FUNCTION

Kiss-Laszlo et al. (1996) found that a 15-nucleotide sequence of RNU50
was complementary to a region near the D box of 28S ribosomal RNA (see
180450), and that a 12-nucleotide sequence of RNU50 was complementary to
a region near the D-prime box of 28S RNA. These regions of 28S RNA
contain an O-methylcytosine and a potential O-methylguanine,
respectively. Kiss-Laszlo et al. (1996) hypothesized that RNU50 may have
a role in methylation of 28S RNA at these sites.

Using Northern blot analysis and real-time PCR, Dong et al. (2008)
showed that expression of snoRNA U50 was downregulated in a significant
number of primary prostate cancer specimens and prostate cancer cell
lines. Ectopic expression of snoRNA U50 significantly reduced colony
formation in the 2 prostate cancer cell lines examined.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tanaka et al. (2000) determined that the
SNORD50A gene lies within intron 5 of the SNHG5 gene (613263) on
chromosome 6q15.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Dong et al. (2008) identified a homozygous 2-bp (TT) germline deletion
in the SNORD50A gene in 2 (2%) of 89 unrelated patients with prostate
cancer but not in 104 men without prostate cancer. A somatic homozygous
TT deletion was found 2 of 30 prostate cancer cell lines or xenografts,
and 9 of 89 localized prostate cancers (total, 11 (9%) of 119 cancers).
The homozygous deletion abolished U50 suppressive function in a colony
formation assay, suggesting that SNORD50A is a tumor suppressor gene and
that germline mutation may increase susceptibility to prostate cancer.
Further analysis of 1,371 prostate cancer patients and 1,371 matched
controls showed that a heterozygous germline TT deletion was found at
similar levels in patients and controls, suggesting that it may be a
common polymorphism.

612092	TITLE *612092 MICRO RNA 200C; MIR200C
;;miRNA200C;;
MIRN200C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIRN200C, are 20- to 22-nucleotide noncoding
RNAs that inhibit gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by
binding to complementary sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of target mRNAs
(Park et al., 2008).

CLONING

Park et al. (2008) stated that miR200C belongs to the miR200 family of
miRNAs, which can be divided into 2 subfamilies based on a 1-nucleotide
difference in seed sequences. miR200A (612090) and miR141 (612093) have
a seed sequence of AACACUG, whereas miR200B (612091), miR200C, and
miR429 (612094) have a seed sequence of AAUACUG.

GENE FUNCTION

Park et al. (2008) evaluated expression of 207 miRNAs in 60 human cell
lines and found that expression of miR200 family members, including
miR200C, was associated with an epithelial phenotype. Expression of
these miRNAs showed a positive correlation with expression of E-cadherin
(CDH1; 192090), an epithelial cell marker, and a negative correlation
with expression of vimentin (VIM; 193060), a mesenchymal cell marker.
Park et al. (2008) identified multiple miR200 target sequences in the
3-prime UTRs of the E-cadherin transcriptional repressors ZEB1 (189909)
and ZEB2 (605802). Using the 3-prime UTRs of mouse and human ZEB1 and
ZEB2, they showed that endogenous miR200s suppressed ZEB1 and ZEB2
expression. Increasing the levels of miR200A and miR200C induced
mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in human cancer cell lines,
reducing their aggressiveness. Conversely, reducing miR200 levels
induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Park et al. (2008)
concluded that the miR200 family regulates EMT/MET by targeting ZEB1 and
ZEB2, which control expression of E-cadherin.

Using the MDCK canine epithelial cell line and a subclone with a
mesenchymal phenotype, Gregory et al. (2008) independently showed that
the miR200 family, including miR141, and miR205 (613147) regulated
expression of Zeb1 and Zeb2 and controlled EMT. Furthermore, expression
of the miR200 family and miR205 was lost in invasive human breast cancer
cell lines with mesenchymal phenotype and in primary breast cancer
specimens lacking E-cadherin.

Shimono et al. (2009) showed that MIR200C downregulated expression of
BMI1 (164831), a regulator of stem cell self-renewal. Expression of
MIR200C resulted in growth retardation and differentiation in Tera-2
cells, suppressed clonogenicity in mouse breast cancer cells, reduced
tumorigenicity of human breast cancer stem cells in immunocompromised
mice, and suppressed mammary outgrowth from normal mouse mammary stem
cells in vivo. Shimono et al. (2009) concluded that MIR200C provides a
molecular link between normal and cancerous stem cells.

MAPPING

Park et al. (2008) stated that the miR200 family members MIRN200C and
MIRN141 are clustered on chromosome 12, whereas MIRN200A, MIRN200B, and
MIRN429 are clustered on chromosome 1.
