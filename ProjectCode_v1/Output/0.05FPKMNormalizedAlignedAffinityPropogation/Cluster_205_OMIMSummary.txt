;;CARABIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Carabin is an endogenous inhibitor of calcineurin (see 114105) that also
inhibits the Ras (see 190020) signaling pathway through its intrinsic
Ras GTPase-activating protein activity (Pan et al., 2007).

CLONING

Pan et al. (2007) identified carabin using a yeast 2-hybrid system
screening of a human T cell cDNA library with truncated and
catalytically inactive calcineurin as bait. Carabin was so named on the
basis of its ability to interact with both calcineurin and Ras. Human
carabin consists of 446 amino acid residues and is 88% identical in
sequence to the mouse ortholog. Carabin contains a putative Ras/Rab GAP
domain at its amino terminus (residues 89 to 294) and a carboxy-terminal
domain (residues 406 to 446) that mediates its interaction with
calcineurin. Northern blot analysis revealed that carabin is most
abundant in spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Pan et al. (2007) showed that carabin inhibits the Ras signaling pathway
through its intrinsic Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity.
Expression of carabin is upregulated on T cell receptor (TCR) signaling
in a manner that is sensitive to inhibitors of calcineurin, indicating
that carabin constitutes part of a negative regulatory loop for the
intracellular TCR signaling pathway. Knockdown of carabin by short
interfering RNA led to significant enhancement of IL2 (147680)
production by antigen-specific T cells in vitro and in vivo. Thus, Pan
et al. (2007) concluded that carabin is a negative feedback inhibitor of
the calcineurin signaling pathway that also mediates crosstalk between
calcineurin and Ras.

MAPPING

Strausberg et al. (2002) mapped the TBC1D10C gene to human chromosome
11q13.1.

;;SISTER CHROMATID COHESION 4, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; SCC4;;
KIAA0892
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sister chromatids remain connected following duplication in S phase
until they segregate during anaphase of mitosis or meiosis II. This
cohesion counteracts the force of spindle microtubules on sister
kinetochores and allows chromosomes to align at the mitotic spindle.
Sister chromatid cohesion is also essential for segregation of
homologous chromosomes during meiosis I and for repair of DNA
double-strand breaks during G2 phase. Cohesin (see 606462) is a protein
complex required for sister chromatid cohesion. MAU2 forms a dimer with
NIPBL (608667) that is essential for loading the cohesin complex onto
sister chromatids (Watrin et al., 2006).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned MAU2, which they designated
KIAA0892. The deduced protein contains 621 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected MAU2 expression in all adult and fetal tissues examined, with
highest expression in ovary, followed by testis, brain, spinal cord,
heart, and lung. Within specific adult brain regions, highest expression
was detected in corpus callosum, amygdala, and caudate nucleus.

By searching databases for orthologs of yeast Scc4, Watrin et al. (2006)
identified human MAU2, which they called SCC4. The deduced 651-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 69 kD. SCC4 consists of
tandem alpha helices of 10 to 15 amino acids each that are arranged in
tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs). SCC4 contains at least 6 TPRs and may
contain up to 12 TPRs. Fluorescence-tagged SCC4 localized to HeLa cell
nuclei during interphase and redistributed throughout the cytoplasm
after nuclear envelope breakdown in mitosis. Western blot analysis of
HeLa cell nucleoplasmic extracts showed that SCC4 had an apparent
molecular mass of 66 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Watrin et al. (2006) showed that
SCC4 interacted with SCC2 (NIPBL) in HeLa cell nucleoplasmic extracts.
SCC4 and SCC2 cosedimented in fractionated HeLa cell extracts and
colocalized on chromatin in HeLa cells during interphase and telophase.
Depletion of either SCC4 or SCC2 via small interfering RNA delayed
mitotic exit and caused loss of cohesin from chromatin during interphase
and telophase, precocious loss of sister chromatid cohesion,
misalignment of chromosomes, appearance of single sister chromatids, and
prometaphase arrest. Knockdown of either SCC4 or SCC2 also reduced the
amount of the other protein, suggesting that physical association
between them is required for stability. Chromosomes in SCC4- or
SCC2-depleted cells lacked cohesin despite the presence of the cohesin
protectors SGO1 (SGOL1; 609168) and BUB1 (602452).

Independently, Seitan et al. (2006) showed that MAU2
coimmunoprecipitated with delangin (NIPBL). Drosophila and Xenopus
orthologs of MAU2 and delangin also interacted directly. Protein
truncation and yeast 2-hybrid analyses revealed that the N termini of
MAU2 and delangin mediated their interaction. Knockdown of MAU2 in HeLa
cells resulted in increased frequency of precocious sister chromatid
separation. In control cells, release from block in G2/M resulted in
rapid loading of cohesin subunits onto chromatin. In MAU2 knockdown
cells, cohesin complexes formed, but they failed to load onto chromatin.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the MAU2 gene to chromosome 19p13.11 based on an
alignment of the MAU2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB020699) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

611831	TITLE *611831 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L18; MRPL18
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPL18
is a component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases using bovine Mrpl18 as query, Koc et al. (2001)
identified human MRPL18, which encodes a deduced 180-amino acid protein.
They also identified MRPL18 homologs in mouse, Drosophila, C. elegans,
E. coli, and Arabidopsis, but not in yeast. Mouse and human MRPL18 share
83.3% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the MRPL18 gene to chromosome 6q25.3 based on an
alignment of the MRPL18 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF161556) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

;;AMP-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE, CATALYTIC, ALPHA-1;;
AMPK-ALPHA-1
DESCRIPTION The mammalian 5-prime-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) appears to
play a role in protecting cells from stresses that cause ATP depletion
by switching off ATP-consuming biosynthetic pathways. AMPK is a
heterotrimeric protein composed of 1 alpha subunit, 1 beta subunit
(e.g., PRKAB1; 602740), and 1 gamma subunit (e.g., PRKAG1; 602742). The
catalytic alpha subunit requires phosphorylation for full activity. It
is related to the S. cerevisiae Snf1 protein kinase, which is involved
in the response to nutritional stress. The noncatalytic beta and gamma
subunits are related to yeast proteins that interact with Snf1: the beta
subunit to the Sip1/Sip2/Gal83 family of transcription regulators, and
the gamma subunit to Snf4, which is thought to be an activator of Snf1.

CLONING

Stapleton et al. (1996) reported the sequences of partial human liver
cDNAs encoding AMPK-alpha-1.

Stapleton et al. (1996) cloned rat hypothalamus cDNAs encoding
Ampk-alpha-1. By Northern blot analysis, they detected low levels of a
6-kb Ampk-alpha-1 mRNA in all rat tissues examined except testis, where
a low level of a 2.4-kb transcript was observed. The predicted 548-amino
acid protein has a molecular mass of approximately 63 kD by SDS-PAGE.
Rat Ampk-alpha-1 and Ampk-alpha-2 (600497) have 90% amino acid sequence
identity within their catalytic cores but only 61% in their C-terminal
tails.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Stapleton et al. (1997) mapped
the human AMPK-alpha-1 gene to 5p12.

GENE FUNCTION

Adiponectin (605441) is a hormone secreted by adipocytes that regulates
energy homeostasis and glucose and lipid metabolism. Yamauchi et al.
(2002) demonstrated that phosphorylation and activation of AMPK are
stimulated with globular and full-length adiponectin in skeletal muscle
and only with full-length adiponectin in the liver. In parallel with its
activation of AMPK, adiponectin stimulates phosphorylation of acetyl
coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC1; 200350), fatty acid oxidation, glucose
uptake and lactate production in myocytes, phosphorylation of ACC and
reduction of molecules involved in gluconeogenesis in the liver, and
reduction of glucose levels in vivo. Blocking AMPK activation by a
dominant-negative mutant inhibits each of these effects, indicating that
stimulation of glucose utilization and fatty acid oxidation by
adiponectin occurs through activation of AMPK. Yamauchi et al. (2002)
concluded that their data provided a novel paradigm, that an
adipocyte-derived antidiabetic hormone, adiponectin, activates AMPK,
thereby directly regulating glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity
in vitro and in vivo.

Minokoshi et al. (2004) investigated the potential role of AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) in the hypothalamus in the regulation of food
intake. Minokoshi et al. (2004) reported that AMPK activity is inhibited
in arcuate and paraventricular hypothalamus by the anorexigenic hormone
leptin (164160), and in multiple hypothalamic regions by insulin
(176730), high glucose, and refeeding. A melanocortin receptor (see
155555) agonist, a potent anorexigen, decreased AMPK activity in
paraventricular hypothalamus, whereas agouti-related protein (602311),
an orexigen, increased AMPK activity. Melanocortin receptor signaling is
required for leptin and refeeding effects of AMPK in the paraventricular
hypothalamus. Dominant-negative AMPK expression in the hypothalamus was
sufficient to reduce food intake and body weight, whereas constitutively
active AMPK increased both. Alterations of hypothalamic AMPK activity
augmented changes in arcuate neuropeptide expression induced by fasting
and feeding. Furthermore, inhibition of hypothalamic AMPK is necessary
for leptin's effects on food intake and body weight, as constitutively
active AMPK blocks these effects. Thus, Minokoshi et al. (2004)
concluded that hypothalamic AMPK plays a critical role in hormonal and
nutrient-derived anorexigenic and orexigenic signals and in energy
balance.

Baba et al. (2006) showed that FNIP1 (610594) interacted with the alpha,
beta, and gamma subunits of AMPK. FNIP1 was phosphorylated by AMPK, and
its phosphorylation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by an AMPK
inhibitor, resulting in reduced FNIP1 expression. FLCN (607273)
phosphorylation was diminished by rapamycin and amino acid starvation
and facilitated by FNIP1 overexpression, suggesting that FLCN
phosphorylation may be regulated by mTOR (FRAP1; 601231) and AMPK
signaling. Baba et al. (2006) concluded that FLCN and FNIP1 may be
involved in energy and/or nutrient sensing through the AMPK and mTOR
signaling pathways.

Miller et al. (2008) showed that macrophage migration inhibitory factor
(MIF; 153620), an upstream regulator of inflammation, is released in the
ischemic heart, where it stimulates AMPK activation through CD74
(142790), promotes glucose uptake, and protects the heart during
ischemia-reperfusion injury. Germline deletion of the Mif gene impairs
ischemic AMPK signaling in the mouse heart. Human fibroblasts with a
low-activity MIF promoter polymorphism have diminished MIF release and
AMPK activation during hypoxia. Thus, MIF modulates the activation of
the cardioprotective AMPK pathway during ischemia, functionally linking
inflammation and metabolism in the heart. Miller et al. (2008)
anticipated that genetic variation in MIF expression may influence the
response of the human heart to ischemia by the AMPK pathway, and that
diagnostic MIF genotyping might predict risk in patients with coronary
artery disease.

Canto et al. (2009) demonstrated that AMPK controls the expression of
genes involved in energy metabolism in mouse skeletal muscle by acting
in coordination with another metabolic sensor, the NAD+-dependent type
III deacetylase SIRT1 (604479). AMPK enhances SIRT1 activity by
increasing cellular NAD+ levels, resulting in the deacetylation and
modulation of the activity of downstream SIRT1 targets that include the
PPAR-gamma coactivator 1-alpha (604517) and the FOXO1A (136533) and
FOXO3A (602681) transcription factors. Canto et al. (2009) concluded
that the AMPK-induced SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of these targets
explains many of the convergent biologic effects of AMPK and SIRT1 on
energy metabolism.

Studying mouse fibroblasts, Lamia et al. (2009) demonstrated that the
nutrient-responsive adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) phosphorylates and destabilizes the clock component
cryptochrome-1 (CRY1; 601933). In mouse livers, AMPK activity and
nuclear localization were rhythmic and inversely correlated with CRY1
nuclear protein abundance. Stimulation of AMPK destabilized
cryptochromes and altered circadian rhythms, and mice in which the AMPK
pathway was genetically disrupted showed alterations in peripheral
clocks. Thus, Lamia et al. (2009) concluded that phosphorylation by AMPK
enables cryptochrome to transduce nutrient signals to circadian clocks
in mammalian peripheral organs.

Bungard et al. (2010) found that AMPK activates transcription through
direct association with chromatin and phosphorylation of histone H2B
(see 609904) at ser36. AMPK recruitment and H2B ser36 phosphorylation
colocalized within genes activated by AMPK-dependent pathways, both in
promoters and in transcribed regions. Ectopic expression of H2B in which
ser36 was substituted by alanine reduced transcription and RNA
polymerase II (see 180660) association to AMPK-dependent genes, and
lowered cell survival in response to stress. Bungard et al. (2010)
concluded that their results placed AMPK-dependent H2B serine-36
phosphorylation in a direct transcriptional and chromatin regulatory
pathway leading to cellular adaptation to stress.

AMPK is an alpha-beta-gamma heterotrimer activated by decreasing
concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and increasing AMP
concentrations (summary by Oakhill et al., 2011). AMPK activation
depends on phosphorylation of the alpha catalytic subunit on thr172 by
kinases LKB1 (602216) or CaMKK-beta (CAMKK2; 615002), and this is
promoted by AMP binding to the gamma subunit (602742). AMP sustains
activity by inhibiting dephosphorylation of alpha-thr172, whereas ATP
promotes dephosphorylation. Oakhill et al. (2011) found that adenosine
diphosphate (ADP), like AMP, bound to gamma sites 1 and 3 and stimulated
alpha-thr172 phosphorylation. However, in contrast to AMP, ADP did not
directly activate phosphorylated AMPK. In this way, both ADP/ATP and
AMP/ATP ratios contribute to AMPK regulation.

Salicylate, the active component of willow bark, has been in medicinal
use since ancient times and has more recently been replaced by synthetic
derivatives such as aspirin and salsalate. Using concentrations of
salicylate reached in plasma after administration of high-dose aspirin
or salsalate, Hawley et al. (2012) showed that salicylate activated
AMPK. Salicylate bound AMPK at the same site as a synthetic activator to
cause allosteric activation and inhibition of dephosphorylation at the
activating site, thr172. In mice lacking Ampk, the effects of salicylate
to increase fat utilization and to lower plasma fatty acid were lost.
Hawley et al. (2012) proposed that AMPK activation explains some
beneficial effects of salsalate and aspirin.

Jeon et al. (2012) demonstrated that AMPK activation, during energy
stress, prolongs cell survival by redox regulation. Under these
conditions, NADPH generation by the pentose phosphate pathway is
impaired, but AMPK induces alternative routes to maintain NADPH and
inhibit cell death. The inhibition of the acetyl-CoA carboxylases ACC1
(200350) and ACC2 (601557) by AMPK maintains NADPH levels by decreasing
NADPH consumption in fatty acid synthesis and increasing NADPH
generation by means of fatty acid oxidation. Knockdown of either ACC1 or
ACC2 compensates for AMPK activation and facilitates
anchorage-independent growth and solid tumor formation in vivo, whereas
the activation of ACC1 or ACC2 attenuates these processes. Thus AMPK, in
addition to its function in ATP homeostasis, has a key function in NADPH
maintenance, which is critical for cancer cell survival under energy
stress conditions, such as glucose limitations, anchorage-independent
growth, and solid tumor formation in vivo.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Xiao et al. (2007) reported the crystal structure of the regulatory
fragment of mammalian AMPK in complexes with AMP and ATP. The phosphate
groups of AMP/ATP lie in a groove on the surface of the gamma domain,
which is lined with basic residues, many of which are associated with
disease-causing mutations. Structural and solution studies revealed that
2 sites on the gamma domain bind either AMP or magnesium ATP, whereas a
third site contains a tightly bound AMP that does not exchange. Xiao et
al. (2007) stated that their binding studies indicated that under
physiologic conditions AMPK mainly exists in its inactive form in
complex with magnesium ATP, which is much more abundant than AMP. Their
modeling studies suggested how changes in the concentration of AMP
enhance AMPK activity levels. The structure also suggested a mechanism
for propagating AMP/ATP signaling whereby a phosphorylated residue from
the alpha and/or beta subunits binds to the gamma subunit in the
presence of AMP but not when ATP is bound.

Xiao et al. (2011) showed that ADP binding to just 1 of the 2
exchangeable AXP (AMP/ADP/ATP) binding sites on the regulatory domain of
AMPK protects the enzyme from dephosphorylation, although it does not
lead to allosteric activation. Their studies showed that active
mammalian AMPK displays significantly tighter binding to ADP than to
Mg-ATP, explaining how the enzyme is regulated under physiologic
conditions where the concentration of Mg-ATP is higher than that of ADP
and much higher than that of AMP. Xiao et al. (2011) determined the
crystal structure of an active AMPK complex. The structure showed how
the activation loop of the kinase domain is stabilized by the regulatory
domain and how the kinase linker region interacts with the regulatory
nucleotide-binding site that mediates protection against
dephosphorylation. From their biochemical and structural data, Xiao et
al. (2011) developed a model for how the energy status of a cell
regulates AMPK activity.

HISTORY

Lin et al. (2012) reported that acetylation and deacetylation of the
catalytic subunit of AMPK, PRKAA1, a critical cellular energy-sensing
protein kinase complex, is controlled by the opposing catalytic
activities of HDAC1 (601241) and p300 (602700). Deacetylation of AMPK
enhanced physical interaction with the upstream kinase LKB1 (602216),
leading to AMPK phosphorylation and activation, and resulting in lipid
breakdown in human liver cells. The authors later found that the Methods
section in their article was inaccurate. Because they could not
reproduce all of their results, they retracted the article.

608880	TITLE *608880 ZINC FINGER FYVE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 16; ZFYVE16
;;ENDOSOME-ASSOCIATED FYVE DOMAIN PROTEIN; ENDOFIN;;
KIAA0305
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ZFYVE16 gene encodes endofin, an endosomal protein implicated in
regulating membrane trafficking. It is characterized by the presence of
a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding FYVE domain positioned in the
middle of the molecule (Seet et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using BLAST analysis to search for uncharacterized proteins containing
FYVE domains, Seet and Hong (2001) identified cDNA KIAA0305. KIAA0305,
corresponding to the ZFYVE16 gene, encodes endofin, a predicted
1,539-amino acid protein that contains a central FYVE domain followed by
a putative Smad-binding domain. Endofin shows similar organization to
SARA (603755); the 2 proteins share approximately 50% identity in the
C-terminal regions. Northern blot analysis showed ubiquitous expression
of 7.4- and 5.5-kb endofin transcripts.

GENE FUNCTION

Using indirect immunofluorescence, Seet and Hong (2001) showed that
endofin is expressed in early endosomes, similar to EEA1 (605070).
Expression constructs of truncated endofin showed that the FYVE domain
is required for endosomal expression, and treatment with the PI3-kinase
inhibitor wortmannin showed that endosomal localization of endofin is
dependent on PI3-kinase activity. While indirect immunofluorescence
showed colocalization of endofin and SARA, coimmunoprecipitation
experiments demonstrated that the 2 proteins do not associate with each
other. Unlike SARA, endofin does not affect TGF-beta (190180)-induced
transcriptional activity. Overexpression of endofin caused endosomal
aggregate formation, and these aggregates accumulated EGF (131530) and
prevented its degradation.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis with the C-terminal portion of endofin as
bait against a human brain cDNA library, Seet et al. (2004) identified
TOM1 (604700) as an endofin binding partner. GST pull-down and
coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed that the C-terminal region of
endofin binds to the C-terminal region of TOM1. Endofin does not bind to
the closely related proteins TOM1L1 (604701) or TOM1L2. While
immunofluorescence showed a cytosolic distribution of TOM1, density
gradient analysis showed partially overlapping expression of TOM1 and
endofin in early endosomes. Overexpression of endofin recruits TOM1 to
endosomal aggregates.

611900	TITLE *611900 METALLOPHOSPHOESTERASE 1; MPPE1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

While characterizing a cosmid containing the 3-prime untranslated region
(UTR) of the GNAL gene (139312), Vuoristo and Ala-Kokko (2001)
identified a transcript corresponding to several human brain ESTs. They
cloned the cDNA for this gene, which they named metallophosphoesterase-1
(MPPE1), from a human brain cDNA library by RT-PCR. Four species of
MPPE1 mRNA were detected. The most abundant form encodes a deduced
396-amino acid protein with a signal sequence, a metallophosphoesterase
domain, and a putative transmembrane domain. One of the alternative
forms encodes a truncated 340-amino acid protein. Northern blot analysis
detected a single 2.2-kb MPPE1 mRNA in brain, but not in any other
tissues tested. The 3 alternative forms were detected in brain by RT-PCR
only.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vuoristo and Ala-Kokko (2001) determined that the MPPE1 gene contains 14
exons and spans about 27 kb. They detected 4 alternatively spliced
forms: the most abundant form contains exons 1, 2, 5-12, and 14, and
another form consists of exons 1, 2, and 5-14; the 2 rare forms
correspond to these 2, but lack the sequences for exon 10.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Vuoristo and Ala-Kokko (2001) mapped the
MPPE1 gene to chromosome 18p11.2. Exons 13, 14 and the 3-prime UTR of
the MPPE1 gene overlap with the 3-prime UTR of the GNAL gene. The 2
genes are oriented in a tail-to-tail manner.

611061	TITLE *611061 FAMILY WITH SEQUENCE SIMILARITY 20, MEMBER C; FAM20C
;;DENTIN MATRIX PROTEIN 4; DMP4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis with the mouse Fam20a (611062) sequence as query,
Nalbant et al. (2005) identified a family of genes with related sequence
that included 2 additional members in mammals, FAM20B (61163) and
FAM20C. The 3 deduced proteins are highly conserved in human, mouse, and
rat. All contain a conserved putative signal sequence and a conserved
C-terminal sequence. Expression analysis showed that, like FAM20A,
FAM20B and FAM20C are expressed during hematopoiesis.

Hao et al. (2007) isolated a dentin matrix protein, DMP4 (FAM20C), from
a rat odontoblast cDNA library. Using a partial rat DMP4 sequence, they
obtained a full-length mouse Dmp4 cDNA, which encodes a deduced
579-amino acid protein with a 26-amino acid signal sequence, a Greek key
calcium-binding domain, and a conserved C-terminal domain. The protein
contains several potential N-linked glycosylation sites and has a
calculated pI of 7.1, much different from other dentin matrix proteins,
which are acidic (e.g., DMP1, 600980). Northern blot analysis of mouse
tissues showed highest levels of transcript in the dental
pulp-odontoblast complex, moderate expression in bone, and low
expression in kidney, liver, brain, and lung. Transfection experiments
demonstrated perinuclear and cytoplasmic staining, consistent with an
endoplasmic reticulum localization. In situ hybridization showed strong
signals in the differentiated odontoblasts of 3-day-old mice, and low
signals in osteoblasts and ameloblasts.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hao et al. (2007) mapped the mouse Dmp4
gene to chromosome 5G2, which has syntenic homology with human 7p22.
Scott (2007) mapped the human DMP4 gene to chromosome 7p22.3 based on an
alignment of the DMP4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AC093627) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

GENE FUNCTION

By overexpressing Dmp4 in cell culture or blocking its expression with
shRNA, Hao et al. (2007) demonstrated that Dmp4 could differentiate
mesenchymal precursor cells into functional odontoblast-like cells. The
authors concluded that DMP4 is likely a soluble regulator of dentin
mineralization.

Tagliabracci et al. (2012) identified a family of atypical protein
kinases that localize within the Golgi apparatus and are secreted.
FAM20C appears to be the Golgi casein kinase that phosphorylates
secretory pathway proteins with S-x-E motifs. FAM20C phosphorylates the
caseins and several secreted proteins implicated in biomineralization,
including the small integrin-binding ligand N-linked glycoproteins
(SIBLINGs). This explains why mutations in FAM20C cause an
osteosclerotic bone dysplasia in humans known as Raine syndrome
(259775). Tagliabracci et al. (2012) generated FAM20C missense mutants
associated with lethal and nonlethal forms of Raine syndrome. The
FLAG-tagged mutants were overexpressed with V5-tagged OPN (166490), a
SIBLING, in U2OS cells. FAM20C secretion and OPN phosphorylation were
monitored by means of protein immunoblotting. The FAM20C mutants
phosphorylated OPN less efficiently than the wildtype. Most mutations
prevented FAM20C secretion, despite the fact that many localized within
the secretory pathway. The nonlethal P328S and D451N mutants
phosphorylated OPN, albeit not as efficiently as the wildtype protein.
Thus, Tagliabracci et al. (2012) concluded that mutations in FAM20C
resulting in Raine syndrome appear to affect FAM20C kinase activity and
secretion.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lethal osteosclerotic bone dysplasia (Raine syndrome, RNS; 259775) is an
autosomal recessive disorder characterized by generalized osteosclerosis
with periosteal bone formation and a distinctive facial phenotype.
Affected individuals survive only days or weeks. In a patient with Raine
syndrome, Simpson et al. (2007) identified a chromosome 7 uniparental
isodisomy and a 7p telomeric microdeletion. The extent of the deleted
region at the 7p telomere was established by genotyping microsatellite
markers across the telomeric region. The region contained 5
transcription units. Sequence analysis of FAM20C, located within the
deleted region, in 6 patients with the disorder revealed 4 homozygous
and 2 compound heterozygous mutations (611061.0001-611061.0008). The
identified mutations included 4 nonsynonymous base changes, all
affecting evolutionarily conserved residues, and 4 splice site changes
predicted to have detrimental effects on splicing. The mouse ortholog of
FAM20C, dentin matrix protein-4 (Dmp4), demonstrates calcium-binding
properties; Simpson et al. (2007) showed by in situ hybridization the
expression profile of Dmp4 in mineralizing tissues during development of
the mouse.

In 2 unrelated boys with Raine syndrome who survived infancy and were 8
and 11 years of age, Simpson et al. (2009) identified homozygosity and
compound heterozygosity, respectively, for missense mutations in the
FAM20C gene (611061.0009-611061.0011). Simpson et al. (2009) noted that
these mutations were not shared with any of the previously reported
mutation-positive patients who died in infancy, suggesting that these
mutations might confer a milder phenotype.

In 2 sisters, born of first-cousin parents of Algerian origin, who had
an attenuated phenotype of Raine syndrome with normal psychomotor
development at ages 4 years and 1 year, respectively, Fradin et al.
(2011) identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the FAM20C
gene (611061.0012).

ANIMAL MODEL

Wang et al. (2012) found that Fam20c -/- mice appeared normal at birth,
but they grew slowly and developed progressive skeletal defects. By 4
weeks of age, Fam20c -/- mice showed prominent dwarfism and flat faces,
with defects in endochondral and intramembranous ossification. They also
developed hypophosphatemic rickets, but not osteosclerosis. Both male
and female Fam20c -/- mice were infertile. In contrast, Fam20c +/- mice
appeared normal and were fertile. Microarray analysis of 3-week-old
Fam20c -/- calvaria revealed defects in osteocyte differentiation, with
significant upregulation of Fgf23 (605380) and downregulation of Dmp1
(600980). Knockout of FAM20C in cultured human and mouse osteogenic cell
lines led to similar defects in differentiation. Wang et al. (2012)
noted that the bone phenotype of Fam20c -/- mice differs significantly
from that of many patients with FAM20C mutations.

601530	TITLE *601530 SEQUESTOSOME 1; SQSTM1
;;UBIQUITIN-BINDING PROTEIN P62; P62
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Src homology type 2 (SH2) domain is a highly conserved motif of
about 100 amino acids which mediates protein-protein interactions by
binding to phosphotyrosine. p56-lck (153390), a T-cell-specific src
family tyrosine kinase with an SH2 domain, is involved in T-cell signal
transduction. A 62-kD protein (p62) was identified by Park et al. (1995)
as a ligand of the p56-lck SH2 domain.

Joung et al. (1996) cloned the gene for p62 by purifying the p62 protein
to obtain peptide microsequences, producing a PCR product with
degenerate oligonucleotides, and then using this PCR product to screen a
HeLa cell cDNA library. Sequence analysis of full-length cDNAs by Joung
et al. (1996) revealed that the p62 gene encodes a 440-amino acid
polypeptide with the following conserved domains: (1) a cysteine-rich
domain, predicted to be a metal-binding site involved in protein-protein
or protein-DNA interaction; (2) a region with homology to the cdc42
GTPase binding-site; and (3) a PEST motif which is a degradation signal
found in many short-lived proteins. Northern blot analysis suggested
that p62 is expressed ubiquitously in all tissues examined.

Gong et al. (1999) screened a yeast 2-hybrid library made from rat
hippocampal mRNA against full-length Kv-beta-2 (601142). Two previously
unknown interacting proteins were identified, one of which was identical
to Zip (PKC-zeta (176982)-interacting protein), the rat homolog of p62.
Zip1 and Zip2, which arise from alternative splicing, are identical
except for 27 residues missing from Zip2.

GENE FUNCTION

Park et al. (1995) found that the p56-lck SH2 domain binds to p62 at the
ser59 of p62 only when that serine is phosphorylated. Moreover, Park et
al. (1995) found that p62 is associated with a serine/threonine kinase
activity and also binds to ras GTP-ase-activating protein, a negative
regulator of the ras signaling pathway.

Joung et al. (1996) expressed epitope-tagged p62 in HeLa cells and
showed that the expressed protein bound to the lck SH2 domain and that
this binding was dependent on the N-terminal 50 amino acids of p62 but
not on the tyrosine residue in this region. Thus Joung et al. (1996)
proposed that the mechanism of binding of p62 to the p56-lck SH2 domain
is by a mechanism different from the previously characterized modes of
binding of SH2 domains and their ligands.

Vadlamudi et al. (1996) used the yeast 2-hybrid system to identify
proteins that interact with p62. They isolated 46 clones that tested
positively for specific interaction with p62. Forty-three of the 46
clones were found by sequencing to be members of the ubiquitin family.
Ubiquitination of cellular proteins is a crucial feature in regulation
of signal transduction and cell cycle progression through
ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal degradation of important cellular
proteins. Vadlamudi et al. (1996) studied the interaction of p62 with
ubiquitin by in vitro binding studies which showed that p62 binds
noncovalently to ubiquitin. Vadlamudi et al. (1996) noted that p62
contains no homology with any known ubiquitin-binding protein and thus
represents a new class of ubiquitin-binding protein.

Gong et al. (1999) found that the rat Zip1 and Zip2 isoforms
differentially stimulated phosphorylation of Kv-beta-2 by PKC-zeta. Zip1
and Zip2 interacted to form heteromultimers, allowing for a hybrid
stimulatory activity to PKC-zeta. Gong et al. (1999) found that Zip1 and
Zip2 coexisted in the same cell type and were elevated differentially by
neurotrophic factors. They suggested that these results provide a
mechanism for specificity and regulation of PKC-zeta-targeted
phosphorylation.

By small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Rab factors in a murine
macrophage line, Pilli et al. (2012) showed that inhibition of Rab8b
(613532) caused a decrease in conversion of Mycobacterium bovis BCG
phagosomes to degradative compartments after the induction of autophagy
and autophagic killing of mycobacteria. Knockdown of Rab8b-interacting
partners showed that Tbk1 (604834) was critical for autophagic killing
of BCG by suppressing the maturation of autophagosomes.
Coimmunoprecipitation, proximity ligation in situ analysis, and confocal
microscopy revealed that Tbk1 associated with Rab8b on autophagic
organelles. High-content imaging analysis showed that Tbk1 was required
in bone marrow macrophages for phosphorylation of p62 on ser403, which
was in turn required for autophagic function and clearance of p62 and
associated cargo. Further analysis revealed that Il1b was necessary for
the induction of autophagy in mycobacteria-infected macrophages and that
Tbk1 was required for Il1b-induced autophagic elimination of M.
tuberculosis.

Lee et al. (2012) showed that the atypical (i.e., nontuberculous)
mycobacterium M. abscessus (Mabc) robustly activated the NLRP3 (606416)
inflammasome in human macrophages via dectin-1 (CLEC7A; 606264)/SYK
(600085)-dependent signaling and the cytoplasmic scaffold protein
SQSTM1. Both dectin-1 and TLR2 (603028) were required for Mabc-induced
expression of IL1B (147720), CAMP (600474), and DEFB4 (DEFB4A; 602215).
Dectin-1-dependent SYK signaling, but not MYD88 (602170) signaling, led
to activation of CASP1 (147678) and secretion of IL1B through a
potassium efflux-dependent NLRP3/ASC (PYCARD; 606838) inflammasome.
Mabc-induced SQSTM1 expression was also critically involved in NLRP3
inflammasome activation. Lee et al. (2012) concluded that the NLRP3/ASC
inflammasome is critical for antimicrobial responses and innate immunity
to Mabc infection.

GENE STRUCTURE

The 2,870-nucleotide SQSTM1 transcript is contained within 8 exons
distributed over a 16-kb genomic segment (Laurin et al., 2002).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the p62
gene to chromosome 5q35 (TMAP sts-Z40707).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using 24 French Canadian families and 112 unrelated individuals with
Paget disease of bone (602080), Laurin et al. (2002) confined the PDB3
locus (602080) on 5q35-qter to a region of approximately 300 kb. Within
this interval, 2 disease-related haplotype signatures were observed in
11 families and 18 unrelated patients. This region encoded the SQSTM1
gene, which is a candidate gene for PDB because of its association with
the RANK pathway (see 603499). Screening SQSTM1 for mutations led to the
identification of a recurrent nonconservative change (P392L;
601530.0001) flanking the ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA; position
394-440) of the protein that was not present in 291 control individuals.
The data demonstrated that 2 independent mutational events at the same
position in SQSTM1 cause Paget disease of bone in a high proportion of
French Canadian patients.

Kurihara et al. (2007) found that osteoclast precursors from PDB
patients with the P392L mutation and osteoclast precursors transduced
with p62 protein carrying the P392L mutation were hyperresponsive to
RANKL (TNFSF11; 602642) and TNF (191160) compared with control
osteoclast precursors. Mice transgenic for P392L developed increased
osteoclast numbers and progressive bone loss, but they did not manifest
the increased osteoblast numbers seen in PDB. Kurihara et al. (2007)
concluded that expression of P392L in osteoclasts is necessary to cause
predisposition to PDB, but it is not sufficient for the full PDB
phenotype.

ANIMAL MODEL

Inactivation of constitutive autophagy results in formation of
cytoplasmic protein inclusions and leads to liver injury and
neurodegeneration. Using proteomic, immunoprecipitation, and
immunofluorescence microscopy analyses, Komatsu et al. (2007) found that
p62 interacted with LC3 (MAP1LC3A; 601242) in mouse lysosomes and
autophagosomes. p62 accumulated in autophagy-deficient mouse livers and
neurons lacking Atg5 (604261) or Atg7 (608760). Mice lacking p62 were
fertile and lived more than 1 year, although they developed adult-onset
obesity and diabetes. p62 -/- Atg7 -/- double-knockout mice did not
accumulate ubiquitin protein inclusions in neurons or livers. Komatsu et
al. (2007) concluded that p62 levels are regulated by autophagy and that
the pathology of autophagy deficiency is cell type specific.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PAGET DISEASE OF BONE
SQSTM1, PRO392LEU

In 8 families showing linkage of Paget disease (602080) to the PDB3
locus on 5q, Laurin et al. (2002) used a haplotype signature strategy to
find ancestral haplotypes shared by affected individuals to narrow the
mapping interval. The SQSTM1 gene, which maps to that interval, was
found to have a C-to-T transition at position 1215 in exon 8 in all 5
affected individuals tested. This change caused the substitution of
proline-392 to a leucine (P392L). The P392L mutation was found in 18
(16%) of 112 sporadic cases and in 11 (46%) of 24 families with Paget
disease tested. Haplotype analysis by means of intragenic SNPs showed
that the P392L mutation was associated with 2 distinct haplotypes and
probably originated from 2 independent events. This mutation, occurring
at a hypermutable CpG dinucleotide, may have arisen by deamination of a
methylated cytosine.

.0002
PAGET DISEASE OF BONE
SQSTM1, 1-BP INS, 1224T

Hocking et al. (2002) identified 4 of 62 PDB (602080) families whose
affected members were heterozygous for a T insertion after base 1224 in
the SQSTM1 gene. The mutation was predicted to result in premature
termination at codon 396 in the ubiquitin-binding domain.

.0003
PAGET DISEASE OF BONE
SQSTM1, IVS7, G-A, +1

Hocking et al. (2002) identified an Australian family with PDB (602080)
whose affected members were heterozygous for a G-to-A substitution at
splice donor site IVS7+1 of the SQSTM1 gene. The mutation was predicted
to result in skipping of exon 7, which encodes part of the
ubiquitin-binding domain.

300766	TITLE *300766 NFKB-ACTIVATING PROTEIN; NKAP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NKAP is a transcriptional repressor that associates with the NOTCH (see
190198) corepressor complex and is required for T-cell development
(Pajerowski et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a B-cell cDNA library to identify RIP
(RIPK1; 603453)-interacting proteins, followed by database and PCR
analyses, Chen et al. (2003) cloned NKAP. The predicted 415-amino acid
protein is highly charged and basic. It is highly conserved in evolution
and shares 90% amino acid identity with mouse Nkap. Western blot
analysis showed expression of a 52-kD protein in transfected human
embryonic kidney 293 cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated
nuclear expression of endogenous and overexpressed NKAP in 293 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Chen et al. (2003) found that although NKAP interacted with RIP in yeast
2-hybrid assays, the proteins did not interact in transfected 293 cells.
Reporter gene analysis showed that NKAP activated NFKB (see 164011), but
not AP1 (165160), in a dose-dependent manner. Knockdown of NKAP by
antisense RNA inhibited TNF (191160)- and IL1 (see 147760)-induced NFKB
activation. Chen et al. (2003) concluded that NKAP is a nuclear
regulator of NFKB activation pathways.

Pajerowski et al. (2009) identified NKAP through its ability to
complement a mutant human T-cell line. Transfection experiments showed
that NKAP coimmunoprecipitated with CIR (605228) and with HDAC3
(605166), but not with CSL (CSHL1; 603515) or with other HDACs. The
interaction with HDAC3 required the C terminus of NKAP. Luciferase and
chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that NKAP functioned as
a transcriptional repressor at a NOTCH-regulated promoter. Mutation
analysis showed that neither HDAC3-binding nor CIR-binding activity
alone was sufficient for NKAP to function as a repressor of
NOTCH-mediated transcription. Flow cytometric analysis showed an inverse
relationship between Nkap and Deltex-1 (DTX1; 602582) expression
throughout T-cell development in mice. Conditional Nkap deficiency
blocked development of alpha-beta T cells at the DN3 stage and led to
increased expression of Notch target genes. Pajerowski et al. (2009)
concluded that NKAP functions as a transcriptional repressor that acts
on NOTCH target genes and is required for alpha-beta T-cell development.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the NKAP
gene to chromosome X (TMAP RH77706).

ANIMAL MODEL

Hsu et al. (2011) generated conditional Nkap-knockout mice, which
exhibited normal thymic cellularity but developed a severe defect in
peripheral T-cell numbers. The conditional Nkap-knockout mice had
defective expression of Qa2, a mouse marker of T-cell maturation and
functional competence. Peripheral naive Cd4 cells from conditional
Nkap-knockout mice were functionally immature recent emigrants from
thymus. Expression of a Bcl2 (151430) transgene failed to rescue the
T-cell maturation deficiency, indicating that the maturation defect was
not due to a failure of cell survival. Hsu et al. (2011) concluded that
NKAP is required for T-cell maturation and the acquisition of functional
competency.

614902	TITLE *614902 RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 33; ARHGAP33
;;TC10/CDC42 GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN; TCGAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chiang et al. (2003) cloned mouse Arhgap33, which they called Tcgap. The
deduced 1,305-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 140
kD. Tcgap has an N-terminal phox (see 608512) homology (PX) domain,
followed by an SRC (190090) homology-3 (SH3) domain, a RHO (see 165390)
GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain, and a proline- and serine-rich
C-terminal domain that includes 22 PxxP motifs. Tcgap also has 5 PEST
sequences, which are typically found in proteins with short half-lives.
Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses revealed high Tcgap expression in
mouse brain and testis, with lower expression in white adipose tissue
and muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Chiang et al. (2003) found that the isolated GAP domain of mouse Tcgap
stimulated the intrinsic GTPase activities of Cdc42 (116952) and Rac1
(602048) in vitro. However, full-length Tcgap did not function as a GAP
following expression in cultured cells. Mutation analysis, in vitro
analysis, and transfection studies revealed that full-length Tcgap and
the isolated Tcgap domains interacted with many partners: the PX domain
interacted with phosphoinositides, predominantly phosphatidylinositol
(4,5)bisphosphate; the GAP domain interacted with the small GTPases
Cdc42 and Tc10-beta (RHOJ; 607653); and the C-terminal proline-rich
domain interacted with the SH3 domain of the insulin-responsive protein
CrkII (CRK; 164762). Insulin treatment of mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes
resulted in Tcgap translocation to the plasma membrane via a Cap
(605264)/Cbl (165360) and CrkII pathway. Tcgap negatively regulated
insulin signaling and blocked insulin-dependent Glut4 (SLC2A4; 138190)
translocation to the plasma membrane and 2-deoxyglucose uptake.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the ARHGAP33 gene to chromosome 19q13.12 based on an
alignment of the ARHGAP33 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY044864) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION Yoshiura et al. (1998) identified a family in which cleft lip and palate
(119530) segregated in 2 of 3 generations with a balanced chromosomal
translocation t(2;19)(q11.2;q13.3). They identified a novel gene on
chromosome 19, which they named 'cleft lip- and palate-associated
transmembrane protein-1' (CLPTM1), by positional cloning. Assembled cDNA
sequences and comparison with genomic sequences predicted a gene with 13
exons encoding a putative protein with 7 transmembrane domains highly
conserved between human and C. elegans. Yoshiura et al. (1998) found
ubiquitous expression of a 2.6-kb transcript using Northern blot
analysis of various adult human tissues and whole-mount in situ
hybridization to day 10-12 postconception mouse embryos. Using SSCP
analysis in sporadic cases of clefting and direct sequencing of coding
sequences in familial cases, Yoshiura et al. (1998) identified no
pathologic mutations.

600075	TITLE *600075 TATA BOX-BINDING PROTEIN; TBP
;;SCA17 GENE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RNA polymerase II transcription factor D (TFIID; see 313650) is a
multisubunit complex essential for the expression of most, if not all,
protein-encoding genes. The DNA-binding subunit of TFIID is the TATA
box-binding protein (TBP).

GENE FUNCTION

The TBP C-terminal domain of 180 amino acids is well conserved, and this
domain is both necessary and sufficient for interaction with DNA and for
assembly of the basal transcription apparatus (Peterson et al., 1990).
Contrary to the previously hypothesized existence of a family of genes
coding for DNA-binding proteins highly related to TBP, Purrello et al.
(1994) showed that the segment coding for the evolutionarily conserved
C-terminal DNA-binding domain is unique. When bound to the TATA box, it
has a saddle-like shape, with the concave face contacting DNA and the
convex interacting with the other subunits of TFIID, which are called
TBP-associated factors (TAFs; see 600475), with TFIIA (600519, 600520)
and TFIIB (189963), with the A form of RNA polymerase II CTD, and with
positive and negative modulators of basal and activated transcription of
class II genes (reviewed by Nikolov et al., 1992). The N terminus of TBP
modulates the DNA-binding activity of the C terminus of the protein. It
contains a long string of glutamine codons, which represents a common
motif among other proteins involved in transcription, such as SP1
(189906) and some homeobox proteins (Purrello et al., 1994).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Juo et al. (2003) reported a 2.95-angstrom resolution crystal structure
of the ternary complex containing BRF1 (604902) homology domain II, the
conserved region of TBP, and 19 basepairs of U6 (180692) promoter DNA.
The structure revealed the core interface for assembly of transcription
factor IIIB and demonstrated how the loosely packed BRF1 domain achieves
remarkable binding specificity with the convex and lateral surfaces of
TBP.

MAPPING

Using a somatic cell hybrid panel, Polymeropoulos et al. (1991)
tentatively assigned the TBP gene to chromosome 6. By multipoint linkage
analysis in CEPH families, Imbert et al. (1994) mapped the TBP gene to
6q27 by linkage to DNA markers. Saito et al. (1994) demonstrated a
polymorphic (CAG)n repeat in the N-terminal region of the TBP gene. They
reported the localization of the gene to 6q27.05-qter by fluorescence in
situ hybridization, using the cDNA clone with or without the (CAG)n
repeat as a probe. Using a 3-prime C-terminal domain cDNA probe,
Purrello et al. (1994) performed in situ hybridization to localize the
TBP locus at 6q27. Segregation analysis with the same probe in a large
series of mouse/human somatic cell hybrids confirmed that the TBP locus
is a single copy and is localized at chromosome 6q21-ter. Rosen et al.
(1995) used oligonucleotide primers flanking a polymorphic stretch of 38
glutamine codons in the 5-prime coding region of the TBP gene to map the
TBP gene to 6qter.

Trachtulec and Forejt (2001) reported that in human, mouse, and snake,
the PDCD2 (600866) and TBP genes are adjacent tail to tail. These 2
genes are linked also in Drosophila and are likewise syntenic in C.
elegans and S. pombe.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

TBP is an important general transcription initiation factor (Kao et al.,
1990; Peterson et al., 1990; Gostout et al., 1993). It contains a long
polymorphic imperfect CAG repeat corresponding to the polyglutamine
region. In a large population study, alleles corresponding to a range of
25 to 42 glutamine residues were detected, with the most common alleles
encoding stretches of 32 to 39 glutamines. A gln42 allele was found only
once in 2,003 chromosomes (Gostout et al., 1993).

Imbert et al. (1994) raised the question of a possible role of an
expanded CAG repeat region of the TBP gene in some late-onset neurologic
disorders.

Several genes for transcription factors, such as TBP and POU-domain
transcription factor (POU1F1; 173110), contain CAG trinucleotide repeats
encoding polyglutamine structures. CAG repeat expansion is known to be
the basis of at least 8 hereditary neurodegenerative disorders,
including Huntington disease (143100), spinocerebellar ataxia-1
(164400), and Machado-Joseph disease (109150). Since the TBP gene
contains particularly long and polymorphic CAG repeats, ranging from 25
to 42, the TBP gene was investigated intensively as a candidate for
psychiatric disorders (Imbert et al., 1994; Rubinsztein et al., 1996;
Jones et al., 1997), but no expansion of the CAG repeat was identified.

- Spinocerebellar Ataxia 17

In a 14-year-old Japanese girl with spinocerebellar ataxia 17 (SCA17;
607136), Koide et al. (1999) identified a de novo expansion of the CAG
repeat of the TBP gene (600075.0001). The mutated TBP, which had an
expanded polyglutamine stretch of 63 glutamines, was expressed in
lymphoblastoid cell lines at a level comparable with that of wildtype
TBP. The CAG repeat of the TBP gene consisted of impure CAG repeat, and
the de novo expansion involved partial duplication of the CAG repeat.
The patient was noted at age 6 to have gait disturbance and intellectual
deterioration. By age 9, she showed truncal ataxia, spasticity, and
muscle weakness. She was confined to a wheelchair at age 13. The
mutation had occurred on the chromosome inherited from her father. She
was identified from a larger group of 118 patients with various forms of
neurologic disease.

Zuhlke et al. (2001) confirmed the report of a polyglutamine disease due
to (CAG)n repeat expansion in the TBP gene. They investigated 604
patients (469 sporadic and 135 familial cases) with ataxia and gait
disturbances in whom repeat expansions of previously identified genes
had been excluded and found repeat expansion in the TBP gene in 2
families of northern German origin with autosomal dominant inheritance
of ataxia, dystonia, and intellectual decline. A marked intra- and
interfamilial phenotypic variability was observed. Elongated
polyglutamine stretches between 50 and 55 residues were demonstrated,
whereas 15 different normal alleles contained 27 to a maximum of 44
triplets.

In patients with a Huntington disease-like phenotype (HDL4; 607136),
Stevanin et al. (2003), Bauer et al. (2004), and Toyoshima et al. (2004)
identified repeat expansions in the TBP gene.

Shatunov et al. (2004) described a 20-year-old North American patient
who developed rapidly progressive cognitive decline and pronounced
ataxia who had a 129M/M PRNP genotype (176640.0005) and was originally
thought to have variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (vCJD; see 123400).
Further studies, however, showed that the patient had an expanded allele
with 55 CAG/CAA repeats in the TBP gene. The patient's unaffected
parents and sibs showed normal-sized TBP alleles with 37 to 38 repeats.
Haplotype and nucleotide sequence analyses indicated that the mutation
had occurred de novo on a chromosome inherited from the father. Shatunov
et al. (2004) suggested that variant CJD should be added to the list of
disorders tested for the TBP trinucleotide expansion.

Tomiuk et al. (2007) analyzed the microsatellite region of the TBP gene
in 10 unrelated German SCA17 patients, 30 unaffected members of 10 SCA17
families, 15 controls, and 10 previously published SCA17 families, as
well as the homologous regions in 10 primate species. They showed that
the characteristic CAA-CAG-CAA interruption pattern was conserved and
likely to result from selection for stabilizing the microsatellite.
Comparison of the microsatellite region across primate species showed
that SCA17 is likely to be a human trait, with the most common 37-repeat
allele acting as a repository for expanded, pathogenic alleles. Tomiuk
et al. (2007) concluded that the cassette-like structure of 5 out of 17
expanded alleles can be attributed to unequal crossing over, thus
explaining the rare and sporadic de novo generation of SCA17 alleles.

Gao et al. (2008) used small pool PCR to compared somatic instability of
expanded CAG repeats in 1 Mexican, 4 Japanese, and 2 German SCA17
families. CAG repeats had 2 distinct configurations: complex or group I
consisting of (CAG)3 (CAA)3 (CAG)n1 CAA-CAG-CAA (CAG)n2 CAA-CAG ('n1'
from 7 to 11 and 'n2' from 9 to 21) and simple or group II consisting of
(CAG)3 (CAA)3 (CAG)n1 CAA-CAG ('n1' from 42 to 47). Both CAG and CAA in
these repeat tracts code for glutamine. Group I mutations were prone to
contraction, whereas group II mutations were prone to continuing
expansion. Analysis of individual alleles showed a correlation between
mutation frequency and the number of CAG/CAA repeats (0.76), but the
difference between the 2 groups was no significant. However, there was a
strong correlation between the configuration of the CAG/CAA repeat and
instability: those with more CAA interruptions showed more stability,
whereas those with less or no CAA interruptions showed more instability.
These changes also correlated with intergenerational instability and
anticipation in regard to age at onset. Of note, the pure CAG repeats
showed both expansion and contraction, while the interrupted repeats
exhibited mostly contraction at a significantly lower frequency. Gao et
al. (2008) suggested that repeat configuration is a critical determinant
for instability, and that CAA interruptions (i.e., CAA-CAG-CAA or domain
3) might serve as a limiting element for further expansion of CAG
repeats at the SCA17 locus.

- Susceptibility to Parkinson Disease

In a patient with Parkinson disease (168600) from Taiwan, Wu et al.
(2004) detected an abnormal trinucleotide repeat expansion (46 repeats)
in the SCA17 gene. The patient presented with typical features of
idiopathic PD: late onset of disease, resting tremor in the limbs,
rigidity, bradykinesia, and a good response to levodopa. The authors
noted that this was the first report describing PD in association with
an expanded allele in the TBP gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Veenstra et al. (2000) tested the role of Tbp during the onset of
embryonic transcription in Xenopus by antisense oligonucleotide-mediated
turnover of maternal Tbp mRNA. Embryos without detectable Tbp initiated
gastrulation but died before completing gastrulation. The expression of
many genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II and III was reduced;
however, some genes were transcribed with an efficiency identical to
that of Tbp-containing embryos. Using a similar antisense strategy,
Veenstra et al. (2000) found that the TBP-like factor Tlf/Trf2 (TBPL1;
605521) was essential for development past the midblastula stage.
Because TBP and a TLF factor were found to play complementary roles in
embryonic development, Veenstra et al. (2000) concluded that their
results indicate that although similar mechanistic roles exist in
common, TBP and TLF function differentially to control transcription of
specific genes.

Mammalian TBP consists of a 180-amino acid core that is common to all
eukaryotes fused to a vertebrate-specific N-terminal domain. Hobbs et
al. (2002) generated mice with a modified Tbp allele, designated Tbp
delta-N, that produced a version of Tbp lacking 111 of the 135
vertebrate-specific amino acids. More than 90% of Tbp delta-N/delta-N
fetuses died in midgestation from an apparent defect in the placenta.
Tbp delta-N/delta-N fetuses could be rescued by supplying them with a
wildtype tetraploid placenta. Mutants also could be rescued by rearing
them in immunocompromised mothers. In immune-competent mothers, survival
of Tbp delta-N/delta-N fetuses increased when fetal/placental
beta-2-microglobulin (B2M; 109700) expression was genetically disrupted.
These results suggested that the TBP N terminus functions in
transcriptional regulation of a placental B2M-dependent process that
favors maternal immunotolerance of pregnancy.

Martianov et al. (2002) inactivated the murine Tbp gene by targeted
disruption. Tbp +/- mice were born in the expected mendelian frequency
and were of normal size and weight, displayed no obvious abnormalities,
and were fertile. Crossing TBP heterozygote mice failed to generate
viable newborn homozygous mutant mice. However, at 3.5 days postcoitum
(E3.5), an approximately mendelian ratio of Tbp -/- mice could be
detected with PCR. When examined by immunofluorescence for expression of
the Tbp protein, blastocysts were detected that were totally negative
for Tbp labeling. TBP was absent in explanted blastocysts grown for 1
day in vitro. Strongly reduced Tbp levels were also detected at E2.5 in
8 cell-stage embryos, which indicates that the maternal Tbp pool was
significantly depleted at this stage and was undetectable by the
blastocyst stage. Blastocysts from Tbp heterozygote crosses were
explanted at E3.5 and cultivated in vitro. Approximately 25% of the
blastocysts rapidly ceased growth and died, whereas the others hatched
from the zona pellucida and continued to develop. After 2 days,
extensive apoptosis was observed in the growth-arrested Tbp homozygous
mutant embryos. Embryos staining negatively for Tbp were also recovered
at E4.5. These embryos typically comprised 30 to 40 cells, fewer than
normally seen in wildtype E3.5 blastocysts, indicating that growth
arrest occurred before E3.5, just as Tbp levels became undetectable.
Martianov et al. (2002) found that after loss of Tbp, RNA polymerase II
(pol II; see 180660) remained in a transcriptionally active
phosphorylation state, and in situ run-off experiments showed high
levels of pol II transcription compared to those of wildtype cells. In
contrast, pol I and pol III transcription was arrested. Martianov et al.
(2002) concluded that their results show a differential dependency of
the RNA polymerases on TBP and provide evidence for TBP-independent pol
II transcriptional mechanisms that allow reinitiation and maintenance of
gene transcription in vivo.

Shah et al. (2009) characterized cellular and mouse models expressing
polyQ-expanded TBP. The rat PC12 cellular model exhibited characteristic
features of neuronal dysfunction, including decreased cell viability and
defective neurite outgrowth. The high-affinity nerve growth factor
receptor, Trka (NTRK1; 191315), was downregulated by mutant TBP in PC12
cells. Downregulation of Trka also occurred in the cerebellum of SCA17
transgenic mice prior to Purkinje cell degeneration. Mutant TBP bound
more Sp1 (189906), reduced its occupancy of the Trka promoter and
inhibited the activity of the Trka promoter. Shah et al. (2009)
suggested that the transcriptional downregulation of TRKA by mutant TBP
may contribute to SCA17 pathogenesis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 17
PARKINSON DISEASE, LATE-ONSET, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
TBP, (CAG)n EXPANSION

Koide et al. (1999) described a sporadic case of a complex neurologic
disorder with cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal signs, and severe
intellectual impairment (SCA17; 607136) associated with expansion of the
CAG repeat of the TBP gene. The gene encoded 63 glutamines, far
exceeding the range in normal individuals (25 to 42 in Caucasians; 31 to
42 in Japanese).

Zuhlke et al. (2001) described 2 German families with an autosomal
dominant degenerative multisystem disorder with predominant ataxia and
intellectual impairment but also involvement of the pyramidal,
extrapyramidal, and possibly autonomic system (607136). Expanded (CAG)n
alleles of the TBP gene ranged between 50 and 55 residues in affected
individuals. In 1 family, 2 affected sisters differed by 1 trinucleotide
repeat, and upon transmission from one of the sisters to her daughter
the repeat was elongated by 2 units. This expansion may have contributed
to the earlier age of onset in the daughter. In the other family, the
(CAG)n element was combined with CAA interruptions, which had not been
described for CAG expansions in other genes.

Nakamura et al. (2001) identified a form of spinocerebellar ataxia- 17
in 4 Japanese pedigrees which was caused by an abnormal (CAG)n expansion
in TBP to a range of 47 to 55 repeats. Age at onset ranged from 19 to 48
years, and symptoms included ataxia, bradykinesia, and dementia.
Postmortem brain tissue from 1 patient exhibited shrinkage and moderate
loss of small neurons with gliosis predominantly in the caudate nucleus
and putamen, with similar but moderate changes in the thalamus, frontal
cortex, and temporal cortex. Moderate Purkinje cell loss and an increase
of Bergmann glia were seen in the cerebellum. Immunocytochemical
analysis performed with anti-ubiquitin (191339) and anti-TBP antibodies
showed neuronal intranuclear inclusion bodies, and most neuronal nuclei
were diffusely stained with 1C2 antibody, which recognizes expanded
polyglutamine tracts.

In a total of 12 patients with a Huntington disease-like phenotype
(607136), Stevanin et al. (2003), Bauer et al. (2004), and Toyoshima et
al. (2004) identified expanded trinucleotide repeats, ranging from 44 to
52 repeats, in the TBP gene. Clinical features were indistinguishable
from Huntington disease, including behavioral changes progressing to
dementia, chorea, cerebellar gait, lower limb hyperreflexia, and
pontocerebellar atrophy.

Shatunov et al. (2004) described a 20-year-old patient who developed
rapidly progressive cognitive decline and pronounced ataxia, a phenotype
compatible with prion disease. No mutation was found in the PRNP gene
(176640), and the patient was found to have a de novo increase of the
trinucleotide repeat number in the coding region of the TBP gene.

606873	TITLE *606873 HEXOSAMINIDASE B; HEXB
ENC1, ANTISENSE, INCLUDED; ENC1AS, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The HEXB gene encodes the beta subunit of the enzyme hexosaminidase (EC
3.2.1.52), which is involved in the breakdown of gangliosides. There are
2 isoenzymes of hexosaminidase: Hex-A, which is encoded by the HEXA gene
(606869), and Hex-B. Beutler et al. (1975) concluded that Hex-A has the
structure alpha-beta, whereas Hex-B has the structure beta-beta.

CLONING

O'Dowd et al. (1985) cloned a human HEXB cDNA from an SV40-transformed
fibroblast cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a deduced 556-amino acid
protein.

Bapat et al. (1988) cloned the murine beta subunit of hexosaminidase.
The cDNA corresponded to a polypeptide of 536 amino acids, which shows
75% homology with the human peptide.

GENE STRUCTURE

Proia (1988) showed that the beta-chain coding region is divided into 14
exons distributed over about 40 kb of DNA. Comparison with the
alpha-chain gene showed that 12 of the 13 introns interrupt the coding
regions at homologous positions. This extensive sharing of intron
placement demonstrates that the alpha and beta chains evolved by way of
duplication of a common ancestor.

Neote et al. (1988) determined that the promoter region of the HEXB gene
is GC-rich, with several GC boxes and a CAAT box.

GENE FUNCTION

Hechtman and Rowlands (1979) studied a temperature-sensitive mutant of
hexosaminidase B. Mahuran et al. (1982) provided biochemical evidence
that the beta(2) subunit may consist of 2 dissimilar polypeptide chains:
beta(a)beta(b). Genetic data suggest that these are the product of a
single locus.

Pennybacker et al. (1996) identified domains in human hexosaminidase
that confer distinctive substrate specificity to Hex-A (composed of
alpha-beta chains), Hex-B (beta-beta), and Hex-S (alpha-alpha) isozymes.
The active site on the beta subunit primarily degrades neutral
substrates while the alpha-subunit site is active against sulfated
substrates. Only Hex-A, together with the GM2 activator protein, can
degrade GM2 ganglioside. Pennybacker et al. (1996) generated chimeric
hexosaminidase subunits by interchanging analogous regions of the alpha
and beta subunits. Chimeric constructs were expressed in HeLa cells and
selected constructs were produced in the baculovirus expression system
to determine their ability to degrade GM2 ganglioside in the presence of
GM2 activator protein. Their results allowed them to define 2
noncontiguous sequences in the alpha subunit (amino acids 1-191 and
403-529) which, when substituted into analogous positions in the beta
subunit, conferred activity against the sulfated substrate. Pennybacker
et al. (1996) also found that amino acids 225-556 in the beta subunit
are required for activator-dependent GM2 ganglioside degradation by
HEXA.

Alterations in chromosome 5q13 are a frequent finding in hairy cell
leukemia (HCL). Hammarsund et al. (2004) reported that a 5q13.3
breakpoint discovered in an HCL patient disrupted a conserved
alternative isoform of HEXB. This isoform directly overlapped, in a
cis-antisense fashion, exon 1 of ENC1 (605173), and was thus named
ENC1AS. Purified HCL tumor cells from 26 HCL patients showed striking
upregulation of ENC1 in all 26 samples analyzed. Hammarsund et al.
(2004) identified a complex 5-prime regulatory mechanism involving an
inverse expression of the ENC1 and the ENC1AS transcripts in several
tissues, suggesting that expression of ENC1AS may regulate ENC1 levels.

Using RNA interference to deplete host genes in Mycobacterium marinum
(Mm)-infected Drosophila S2 cells, which share properties with mammalian
macrophages, Koo et al. (2008) identified a mycobactericidal role for
Hexb. They confirmed the importance of mammalian Hexb in controlling Mm
growth using macrophages from Hexb -/- mice. Treatment of Hexb -/- mouse
cells with Ifng (147570) abolished their susceptibility to Mm. Exposure
of mouse macrophages to Mm, with or without phagocytosis, induced Hexb
secretion, suggesting that Mm comes into contact with Hexb at the plasma
membrane. Incubation of Mm with Hexb, at neutral or acidic pH, killed
Mm. Koo et al. (2008) concluded that HEXB is a peptidoglycan hydrolase
and proposed that it is involved in restricting mycobacteria growth even
before the onset of adaptive immunity.

MAPPING

The HEXB locus has been assigned to chromosome 5 (Gilbert et al., 1975).

Various Sandhoff strains, even cells from the infantile and the rare
juvenile forms, fail to complement in heterokaryons, suggesting that
these are the result of allelic mutations in the beta subunit of HEXB.
Dana and Wasmuth (1982) did cytogenetic and biochemical analyses of
spontaneous segregants from Chinese hamster-human interspecific hybrid
cells (which contained human chromosome 5 and expressed the 4 syntenic
genes LEUS, HEXB, EMTB, and CHR), the hybrid cell being subjected to
selective conditions requiring them to retain the LEUS gene. From these
analyses, Dana and Wasmuth (1982) concluded that the order is as listed
above and that the specific locations are: LEUS, 5pter-q1; HEXB, 5q13;
EMTB, 5q23-q35; CHR, 5q35. In a child with a de novo balanced
translocation t(5;13)(q11;p11), Mattei et al. (1984) found decreased
levels of Hex-B, suggesting to these workers that the HEXB gene
assignment can be narrowed to 5q11.

Killary et al. (1986) assigned the HEXB locus to mouse chromosome 13 by
study of mouse-hamster hybrids.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

O'Brien (1978) made suggestions for the nomenclature of alleles at the
HEX alpha and beta loci. The alleles at the beta locus in his system are
numbered as follows: 1--wildtype; 2--Sandhoff; 3--normal with deficient
Hex-A and Hex-B.

Bikker et al. (1989) demonstrated a 16-kb deletion in 1 allele of the
HEXB gene (606873.0001) in 2 apparently unrelated patients with Sandhoff
disease (268800)

Oonk et al. (1979) reported the cases of 2 adult sisters with
spinocerebellar degeneration and very low activities of both Hex-A and
Hex-B. Bolhuis et al. (1987) concluded that the disorder was the result
of a 'destabilizing mutation' in the HEXB locus. Bolhuis et al. (1993)
demonstrated that these 2 sisters were compound heterozygotes for an
mRNA-negative allele on 1 chromosome 5 and an R505Q mutation
(606873.0009) on the homologous chromosome. Transfection of COS cells
with a cDNA construct containing the R505Q mutation resulted in the
expression of a labile form of beta-hexosaminidase, thus confirming
their earlier conclusion.

Neufeld (1989) provided a review of the disorders related to mutations
in the HEXA and HEXB genes. Mahuran (1998) stated that he maintains a
database of published hexosaminidase and GM2A (613109) mutations and
that the database contains 23 HEXB mutations, 86 HEXA (606869)
mutations, and 4 GM2A mutations.

Among 12 unrelated Italian patients with Sandhoff disease, 11 of whom
had the infantile type, Zampieri et al. (2009) identified 11 different
mutations in the HEXB gene, including 6 novel mutations (see, e.g.,
606873.0017 and 606873.0018). The common 16-kb deletion (606873.0001)
was not identified in this patient cohort.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SANDHOFF DISEASE
HEXB, 16-KB DEL

By field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) of SfiI-digested
chromosomal DNA, Bikker et al. (1989) demonstrated a 16-kb deletion in 1
allele of the HEXB gene in 2 apparently unrelated patients with Sandhoff
disease (268800). Mahuran (1994) pointed out that the 50-kb deletion
(50-KB DEL) originally reported by Bikker et al. (1989) is the same as
the 16-kb deletion described by Neote et al. (1990). The size was
incorrectly estimated by Bikker et al. (1989); see Bolhuis and Bikker
(1992). In conventional Southern blot analysis, this deletion was masked
by hybridization of bands from the other allele. Among 14 patients with
Sandhoff disease from different parts of Europe, Bikker et al. (1990)
found homozygosity for the deletion in 2 and heterozygosity in 7. It
appeared that the deletion started in intron 5, extending in the 5-prime
direction and causing the loss of exons 1 to 5 and the promoter area of
the HEXB gene.

In DNA from fibroblasts of a patient with the infantile form of Sandhoff
disease, Neote et al. (1990) identified a deletion of approximately 16
kb, including the HEXB promoter, exons 1 through 5, and part of intron
5. The deletion probably arose from recombination between 2 Alu
sequences, with the breakpoints occurring at the midpoint between the
left and right arms in each case and regenerating an intact Alu element
in the deletion sequence. The deletion allele accounted for 8 of 30
Sandhoff mutant alleles analyzed. It was present in homozygous state in
2 cell lines from patients with the infantile form, in heterozygous form
together with an intron 12 deletion in a juvenile case, and in
heterozygous form in 2 adult Sandhoff cases. The last 3 cases plus 1
infantile case had the Alu-type deletion in compound heterozygous (i.e.,
heteroallelic) state (see 606873.0014). McInnes et al. (1992) reported
that this 16-kb deletion accounted for 27% of the Sandhoff alleles they
analyzed. This null allele was associated with the juvenile
pro417-to-leu mutation (606873.0007) which interfered with the normal
acceptor splice site. This combination in a French Canadian family was
accompanied by a very mild phenotype which McInnes et al. (1992)
attributed to differences in racial background.

.0002
SANDHOFF DISEASE, JUVENILE TYPE
HEXB, 24-BP INS

In a case of the juvenile form of Sandhoff disease (268800) reported by
Wood and MacDougall (1976), Nakano and Suzuki (1989) showed that a cDNA
clone isolated from fibroblasts contained an extra 24-base segment
between exons 12 and 13. This segment was identified as the 3-prime
terminus of intron 12. The remainder of the coding sequence was
completely normal. The insertion was 'in frame' and added 8 amino acids
between amino acids 491 and 492 of the enzyme protein. It was located
only 5 amino acids away from a possible glycosylation site. Gene
amplification by the PCR and subsequent sequencing of genomic DNA showed
that the patient was a compound heterozygote. In 1 allele there was a
single nucleotide transition from normal G to A at 26 bases from the
3-prime terminus of intron 12. This mutation generated a consensus
sequence for the 3-prime splice site for an intron and thus explained
the abnormal mRNAs that retain 24 bases of the 3-prime terminus of
intron 12. The intron 12 and flanking exons 12 and 13 sequences were
normal in the other allele. The other mutant allele was thought to be of
an mRNA-negative type. The same mutation was found in a 35-year-old
Japanese man with manifestations of juvenile Sandhoff disease:
progressive neurogenic muscular atrophy, cerebellar ataxia, and mental
deterioration beginning at age 10. Dlott et al. (1990) found the same
mutation in cells from 2 juvenile Sandhoff disease patients and a third,
asymptomatic individual.

.0003
HEXOSAMINIDASE B (PARIS)
HEXB, 18-BP INS

Dreyfus et al. (1977) characterized a hexosaminidase variant that may
represent unstable beta subunits. Dlott et al. (1990) demonstrated that
this so-called 'hexosaminidase Paris' had an abnormally elongated beta
subunit due to duplication of a region straddling the junction of intron
13 and exon 14, which generated an alternate splice site and caused an
in-frame insertion of 18 nucleotides into the mRNA. The normal splice
site seemed to be used to some extent, accounting for the residual Hex-A
isoenzyme activity.

.0006
SANDHOFF DISEASE, JUVENILE TYPE
HEXB, TYR456SER

In a female patient with juvenile onset of Sandhoff disease (268800)
manifest as a motor neuron disease (Cashman et al., 1986), Banerjee et
al. (1991) found a heterozygous 1367A-C transversion in the HEXB gene,
resulting in a tyr456-to-ser (Y456S) substitution derived from the
maternal allele. The patient was also heterozygous for 2 polymorphisms:
a 619A-G transition resulting in an ile207-to-val (I207V) substitution
from the paternal allele, and K121R (606873.0008). The patient had
progressive motor neuron disease that began at age 7 and was
characterized by dysarthria, muscle wasting, fasciculations, and
pyramidal tract dysfunction. Rectal biopsy at age 24 showed membranous
cytoplasmic bodies in submucosal ganglion cells. Biochemical studies
showed partial HexA (30-50% of controls) with absence of HexB. The
unaffected mother also had partial HexA and partial HexB deficiency. In
vitro functional expression studies by Banerjee et al. (1994) showed
that the Y456S variant was completely nonfunctinal and was predicted to
interdere with formation of a functional dimer. Banerjee et al. (1994)
proposed that the variant I207V beta-chain inherited from the father
must undergo preferential association with the normal alpha-chains in
the patient, thus producing only HexA. Further studies indicated that
the I207V beta-chain does not self-associate at low concentrations.
Thus, in a patient with a nonfunctional HEXB allele, the effective
concentration of beta-chains is reduced to 50% of normal, and the
remaining I207V chains fail to self-associate to form HexB, but can
still dimerize with the abundant normal alpha-chains, thus producing
partial beta-Hex A and no beta-Hex B.

The ILE207VAL substitution was found to be a common polymorphism by
Zhang et al. (1995) and Redonnet-Vernhet et al. (1996).

.0007
SANDHOFF DISEASE, JUVENILE TYPE
HEXB, PRO417LEU

Wakamatsu et al. (1992) studied a 39-year-old Japanese male with a mild
clinical presentation of mental retardation and 'local panatrophy.' The
parents were first cousins. HEXB activity was undetectable in the
patient's leukocytes and fibroblasts and HEXA activity was decreased to
6 and 8% of control values, respectively. Rectal biopsy demonstrated
membranous cytoplasmic bodies in neurons of Meissner plexus. The urine
contained large amounts of neutral oligosaccharides. Wakamatsu et al.
(1992) discovered a novel exon mutation affecting 3-prime splice site
selection. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the HEXB gene showed 2 single
base substitutions, one in exon 2 (A to G, a known polymorphism) and the
other in exon 11 (C to T). Analysis of the beta-subunit mRNA
demonstrated activation of a cryptic splice site in exon 11 as well as
skipping of the exon. A transfection assay using a chimeric gene
containing intron 10 flanked by cDNA sequences carrying the mutation
confirmed that the single base substitution located at position 8 of
exon 11 inhibited the selection of the normal 3-prime splice site. The
CCG-to-CTG mutation resulted in substitution of leucine for proline-417
in exon 11. The mutation was present in homozygous state in the patient
and in heterozygous state in the parents and a sister. Its effect was to
abolish an MspI site.

McInnes et al. (1992) described a 57-year-old man with very mild
manifestations of Sandhoff disease (268800) although his genotype and
low residual enzyme activity were considered predictive of the much more
severe juvenile Sandhoff disease. They demonstrated that the patient was
a genetic compound of the infantile 5-prime deletion mutation described
by Neote et al. (1990), a null mutation (606873.0004), and the juvenile
intron 10/exon 11 C-to-T mutation. Of his 6 clinically unaffected sibs,
4 of them, ranging in age from 51 to 62 years, were also genetic
compounds for the same 2 Sandhoff alleles. The variable phenotype
associated with the intron 10/exon 11 C-to-T transition indicates that
other unidentified factors determine the pathologic outcome of the
mutation. Genetic variations in the RNA splicing machinery may be the
explanation. The patient, a French-Canadian, had had severe watery
diarrhea over a 9-year period with intermittent moderate and diffuse
abdominal pain, a 17-kg weight loss over a 7-year period, and increasing
weakness. Physical examination showed lower limb hyperreflexia and
impaired thermal sensitivity of legs and arms. Intolerance to warm
weather due to impaired sweating, impaired sexual function progressing
to complete impotence, mild urinary incontinence, and orthostatic
hypotension were noted. One of the sisters, aged 58, had complained of
diarrhea for 10 years and postural dizziness for 5 years.

.0008
HEXB POLYMORPHISM
HEXB, LYS121ARG

In the course of studying a case of juvenile Sandhoff disease (268800),
Wakamatsu et al. (1992) found the AAA-to-AGA polymorphism in exon 2,
which results in alternative substitution of arginine for lysine-121.

.0009
SANDHOFF DISEASE, ADULT TYPE
HEXB, ARG505GLN

In 2 sisters with adult Sandhoff disease (268800) presenting as
spinocerebellar degeneration, reported by Oonk et al. (1979) and
previously studied by Bolhuis et al. (1987), Bolhuis et al. (1993) found
that the HEXB gene contained a G-to-A transition at nucleotide position
1514, resulting in a change in the electric charge at amino acid
position 505 by substitution of glutamine for arginine in a highly
conserved part of the beta chain. The nucleotide transition generated a
new restriction site for DdeI, which was present in only 1 of the
alleles. Bolhuis et al. (1993) demonstrated that the second allele was
of mRNA-negative type. Thus, the patient was a genetic compound.

.0010
SANDHOFF DISEASE, ADULT TYPE
HEXB, PRO405LEU

In a 35-year-old man who was evaluated at age 30 years because of slowly
progressive lower limb weakness and diffuse fasciculations, Gomez-Lira
et al. (1995) found compound heterozygosity with a common deletion at
the 5-prime end of the HEXB gene and a C-to-T transition at nucleotide
1214, resulting in a pro405-to-leu amino acid substitution in the gene
product. The patient was an executive secretary and had been a rock
climber until age 29 years, when lower limb weakness began. On
neurologic examination, moderate reduction in strength, widespread
spontaneous fasciculations, and hyperactive deep tendon reflexes were
observed. Intelligence was normal. The 5-prime deletion, which accounts
for about 30% of the alleles causing Sandhoff disease, results in the
infantile form of the disorder when present in homozygous state. The
pro405-to-leu mutation was observed in homozygous state in a juvenile
onset form of Sandhoff disease in a Japanese patient by Wakamatsu et al.
(1992). The same mutation in compound heterozygosity with the 5-prime
deletion was observed in an adult French-Canadian patient by McInnes et
al. (1992).

.0011
HEXOSAMINIDASE B, HEAT-LABILE POLYMORPHISM
HEXB, ALA543THR

Genotyping individuals for Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) (272800) is based
mainly on the heat lability of beta-hexosaminidase (Hex) A (606869) and
the heat stability of Hex B. Mutations in the HEXB gene encoding the
beta subunits of Hex that result in heat-labile hexosaminidase B thus
may lead to erroneous enzymatic genotyping regarding TSD. Using single
strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis for all 14 exons of
HEXB followed by direct sequencing of aberrant fragments, Narkis et al.
(1997) screened individuals whose Hex B was heat labile. These were
Jewish and Arab individuals that had been identified by Navon and Adam
(1990) and by Navon et al. (1985). The heat-labile mutation in these
instances was identified as 1627 G-A. This caused an ala543-to-thr
substitution in the beta-subunit protein. One individual with
heat-labile Hex B was negative for the 1627 G-A mutation, as well as for
the heat-labile mutation 1514 G-A (606873.0009), proving that there
exists at least one other heat-labile Hex B mutation.

.0012
SANDHOFF DISEASE, INFANTILE TYPE
HEXB, SER62LEU

Zhang et al. (1995) found homozygosity for the ile207-to-val mutation in
the unaffected mother of a child with the infantile form of Sandhoff
disease (268800). The child was a compound heterozygote for a large,
partial deletion of the HEXB gene and for an allele with a C-to-T
substitution at nucleotide 185, which replaced ser62 with leu. The
deletion originated in intron 6, approximately 2.5 kb from the beginning
of exon 7, and appeared to extend approximately 25 kb beyond the 5-prime
end of the gene. Zhang et al. (1995) stated that this was the second
largest deletion, after the very common 16-kb deletion (606873.0001), to
be reported. The 16-kb deletion, spanning the promoter, exons 1-5 and
part of intron 5 of the HEXB gene, is the most common defect, accounting
for 27% of Sandhoff alleles examined.

.0013
SANDHOFF DISEASE, INFANTILE TYPE
HEXB, PARTIAL DEL

See 606873.0012 and Zhang et al. (1995).

.0014
SANDHOFF DISEASE, CHRONIC
HEXB, PRO504SER

Rubin et al. (1988) described 2 sisters of French Canadian ancestry with
a chronic Sandhoff phenotype (268800). Neote et al. (1990) demonstrated
that these patients were heterozygous for the common 16-kb deletion of
the 5-prime portion of the HEXB gene, (606873.0001). Such alleles do not
transcribe HEXB mRNA. Hou et al. (1998) characterized the second mutant
allele in these patients, a missense mutation in exon 13 of the HEXB
gene that resulted in a pro504-to-ser amino acid substitution. This
mutation produced a novel biochemical phenotype that impacted directly
on the ability of HEXA to hydrolyze GM2. This was the first report of a
mutation in the beta-subunit that affected the ability of HEXA to
hydrolyze its natural, but not its artificial, substrates and that
localized essential elements of the beta-chain from natural substrate
hydrolysis to its C terminus.

.0015
SANDHOFF DISEASE, INFANTILE
HEXB, IVS8, G-C, +5

Furihata et al. (1999) determined the molecular basis of infantile
Sandhoff disease (268800) in a Greek Cypriot patient. The proband had
died at the age of 3 years and his parents were not available for study;
the molecular analysis was performed on the mother's first cousin who
was a carrier. A G-to-C transversion was identified in 1 allele of her
HEXB gene at position 5 of the 5-prime splice site of intron 8. A cDNA
clone derived from lymphocyte HEXB mRNA lacked the last 4 nucleotides,
GTTG, of exon 8, which created a premature termination 11 codons
downstream. In vivo transcription of the mutant HEXB gene in CHO cells
showed deletion of the GTTG.

.0016
SANDHOFF DISEASE, INFANTILE
HEXB, 1-BP DEL, 76A

Hara et al. (1994) found a 1-bp deletion, 76delA, in the HEXB gene in a
patient from the Maronite community in Cyprus. Drousiotou et al. (2000)
measured beta-hexosaminidases A and B in both leukocytes and serum in
individuals from Cyprus and identified 35 carriers of Sandhoff disease
(268800) among 244 random Maronite samples and 15 among 28 Maronites
with a family history of Sandhoff disease, but only 1 carrier out of 115
random samples from the Greek community. Of the 50 Maronite carriers
examined, 42 were found to have deletion of 76A.

.0017
SANDHOFF DISEASE, INFANTILE
HEXB, ARG284TER

In 2 unrelated Italian patients with infantile Sandhoff disease
(268800), Zampieri et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 850C-T
transition in the HEXB gene, resulting in an arg284-to-ter (R284X)
substitution. Although the mutation was present in 29% of the alleles
from 12 unrelated Italian patients with infantile Sandhoff disease,
haplotype analysis did not indicate a founder effect. The mutation
occurred in a CpG dinucleotide.

.0018
SANDHOFF DISEASE, INFANTILE
HEXB, 1-BP DEL, 965T

In 2 Italian sibs with infantile Sandhoff disease (268800), Zampieri et
al. (2009) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (965delT) in the HEXB
gene, predicted to result in a frameshift and premature termination. In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the deletion resulted in
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.

141251	TITLE *141251 HEME OXYGENASE 2; HMOX2
;;HEMOXYGENASE 2
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FUNCTION

Heme oxygenase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the heme degradative
pathway (Kutty et al., 1994). This degradative process has 2 important
products, biliverdin, the precursor of the bile pigment bilirubin, and
carbon monoxide, a putative neurotransmitter. There are 2 isozymic forms
of heme oxygenase, an inducible heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1; 141250) and a
constitutive heme oxygenase-2 (HMOX2).

Heme oxygenase-2, which synthesizes carbon monoxide (CO), has been
localized by immunohistochemistry to endothelial cells and adventitial
nerves of blood vessels. It is also localized to neurons in autonomic
ganglia, including the petrosal, superior cervical, and nodose ganglia,
as well as ganglia in the myenteric plexus of the intestine. Zakhary et
al. (1996) demonstrated by enzyme studies that tin protoporphyrin IX is
a selective inhibitor of heme oxygenase with about 10-fold selectivity
for heme oxygenase over endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3; 163729)
and soluble guanylyl cyclase. Inhibition of heme oxygenase activity by
tin protoporphyrin IX reverses the component of endothelial-derived
relaxation porcine distal pulmonary arteries not reversed by an
inhibitor of NOS. Thus, the authors concluded that CO, like nitric oxide
(NO), may have endothelial-derived relaxing activity; additionally, the
similarity of NOS and heme oxygenase-2 localizations and functions in
blood vessels and the autonomic nervous system implies complementary and
possibly coordinated physiologic roles for these 2 mediators.

Using immunoprecipitation studies, Takahashi et al. (2000) showed that
amyloid precursor protein (APP; 104760) and amyloid precursor-like
protein (APLP1; 104775) bound to HMOX1 and HMOX2 in the endoplasmic
reticulum and inhibited heme oxygenase activity by 25 to 35% in vitro.
Familial Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300)-associated APP mutations showed
greater inhibition (45 to 50%) of heme oxygenase. As heme oxygenase
shows antioxidative effects, the authors hypothesized that APP-mediated
inhibition of heme oxygenase may result in increased oxidative
neurotoxicity in AD.

Williams et al. (2004) demonstrated that hemoxygenase-2 is part of the
BK channel complex (600150) and enhances channel activity in normoxia.
Knockdown of hemoxygenase-2 expression reduced channel activity, and
carbon monoxide, a product of hemoxygenase-2 activity, rescued this loss
of function. Inhibition of BK channels by hypoxia was dependent on
hemoxygenase-2 expression and was augmented by hemoxygenase-2
stimulation. Furthermore, carotid body cells demonstrated
hemoxygenase-2-dependent hypoxic BK channel inhibition, which indicated
that hemoxygenase-2 is an oxygen sensor that controls channel activity
during oxygen deprivation.

MAPPING

Using the polymerase chain reaction for analysis of human/rodent somatic
cell hybrids, Kutty et al. (1994) assigned the HMOX2 gene to chromosome
16. They regionalized the assignment to 16p13.3 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH). By FISH, Saito-Ohara et al. (1997) mapped the
Hmox2 gene to mouse chromosome 16B1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Heme oxygenase activity leads to accumulation of the antioxidant
bilirubin, and degradation of the preoxidant heme. Moderate
overexpression of the inducible form, HMOX1, is associated with
protection against oxidative injury. To evaluate the role of HMOX2
(called HO-2 by the authors) in oxidative stress, Dennery et al. (1998)
investigated Hmox2 null 'knockout' mice exposed to more than 95% O(2)
compared with wildtype controls. Similar basal levels of lung
antioxidants were observed, except that the knockouts had a 2-fold
increase in total glutathione content. Despite increased Hmox1
expression from Hmox1 induction, knockout animals were sensitized to
hyperoxia-induced oxidative injury and mortality, and also had
significantly increased markers of oxidative injury before hyperoxic
exposure. The results suggested that Hmox2 functions to augment the
turnover of lung iron during oxidative stress, and that this function
does not appear to be compensated for by induction of Hmox1 in the
knockouts.

607703	TITLE *607703 NUCLEOPORIN, 210-KD; NUP210
;;GP210;;
KIAA0906
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) obtained a partial clone of NUP210, which
they designated KIAA0906. The deduced peptide contains 923 amino acids
and shares 81% identity with the rat integral membrane glycoprotein
Gp210 precursor. RT-PCR ELISA revealed ubiquitous expression, with
highest levels in lung, liver, pancreas, testis, and ovary, intermediate
levels in brain, kidney, and spleen, and lowest levels in heart and
skeletal muscle.

Olsson et al. (1999) cloned mouse Nup210, which they called Pom210, by
differential screening of mesenchymes induced in transfilter cultures by
embryonic spinal cord. The deduced protein contains 1,886 amino acids.
Northern blot analysis detected a 7.5-kb transcript. In situ
hybridization detected preferential expression in epithelial cells. In
kidney, expression was seen in both the epithelium derived from the
ureteric tree and the mesenchyme-derived epithelium. Expression was also
confined to the epithelium in other tissues of 13-day-old embryos. In
nervous tissues, the olfactory epithelium and the walls of the lateral
ventricle were the most prominently stained. Weak expression was
detected in heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Favreau et al. (1996) stated that NUP210 has a cytoplasmic C-terminal
domain facing the nuclear pore. They found that this domain was not
phosphorylated during interphase in HeLa cells or in rat hepatocarcinoma
cells, but it was phosphorylated in mitosis. Mutation analysis of rat
Nup210 determined that phosphorylation occurred on ser1880.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the NUP210
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP stSG4499).

;;MADH2;;
SMA- AND MAD-RELATED PROTEIN 2 MAD, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF;;
MADR2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Riggins et al. (1996) identified a homolog of the Drosophila 'mothers
against decapentaplegic' (Mad) gene (also 'mothers against dpp'). The
predicted 467-amino acid polypeptide, referred to by them as JV18-1,
shows maximal homology to Mad genes at the amino and carboxy termini of
the protein, with 62% identity to Mad over 373 amino acids. Drosophila
Mad apparently acts downstream of the TGF-beta receptor (190181) to
transduce signals from the members of the TGF-beta gene family (190180).
The gene product shows 44% identity over 158 amino acids to another Mad
homolog, DPC4 (SMAD4; 600993).

Graff et al. (1996) described a family of Xenopus proteins homologous to
the Drosophila Mad and C. elegans CEM genes. MAD and MAD-related
proteins are important components of the serine/threonine kinase
receptor signal transduction pathways. Eppert et al. (1996) cloned and
characterized a member of this family, which they designated MADR2. The
gene encodes a 467-amino acid protein that contains no common structural
motifs known at that time. MADR2 shares high homology with MADR1
(601595) and significant homology with DPC4. They reported that MADR2 is
rapidly phosphorylated by activation of the TGF-beta signaling pathway.

By RT-PCR of human erythroleukemia cell mRNA using primers based on
conserved regions between the Drosophila Mad and C. elegans Sma genes,
Nakao et al. (1997) cloned a SMAD2 cDNA. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected ubiquitously expressed 3.4- and 2.9-kb SMAD2
transcripts. The encoded protein has a molecular mass of 58 kD by
SDS-PAGE.

Baker and Harland (1996) identified the mouse Madr2 gene using a
functional assay to clone mouse mesoderm inducers from Xenopus ectoderm.
The mouse amino acid sequence is 46% identical to the human tumor
suppressor DPC4. Madr2 was expressed widely in the mouse embryo (with
the exception of heart and the tail bud) from embryonic days 6.5 to
10.5. Madr2 was found to be confined to the nucleus in the deep anterior
cells of the second axis, whereas it was localized in the cytoplasm in
the epidermal and more posterior cells. Because Madr2 localized to the
nucleus in response to activin (see 147290) and because activin-like
phenotypes were induced by overexpression of Madr2, Baker and Harland
(1996) concluded that Madr2 is a signal transduction component that
mediates the activity of activin.

GENE FUNCTION

Macias-Silva et al. (1996) demonstrated that MADR2 and not the related
protein DPC4 transiently interacts with the TGF-beta receptor and is
directly phosphorylated by the complex on C-terminal serines.
Interaction of MADR2 with receptors and phosphorylation requires
activation of receptor I by receptor II and is mediated by the receptor
I kinase. Mutation of the phosphorylation sites generated a
dominant-negative MADR2 that blocks TGF-beta-dependent transcriptional
responses, stably associates with receptors, and fails to accumulate in
the nucleus in response to TGF-beta signaling. Thus, Macias-Silva et al.
(1996) concluded that transient association and phosphorylation of MADR2
by the TGF-beta receptor is necessary for nuclear accumulation and
initiation of signaling.

SMAD proteins mediate TGF-beta signaling to regulate cell growth and
differentiation. Stroschein et al. (1999) identified SnoN (165340) as a
component of the SMAD pathway. They proposed a model of regulation of
TGF-beta signaling by SnoN in which SnoN maintains the repressed state
of TGF-beta target genes in the absence of ligand and participates in
the negative feedback regulation of TGF-beta signaling. In the absence
of TGF-beta, SnoN binds to the nuclear SMAD4 (DPC4) and represses
TGF-beta-responsive promoter activity through recruitment of a nuclear
repressor complex. TGF-beta induces activation and nuclear translocation
of SMAD2, SMAD3 (603109), and SMAD4. SMAD3 causes degradation of SnoN,
allowing a SMAD2/SMAD4 complex to activate TGF-beta target genes. To
initiate a negative feedback mechanism that permits a precise and timely
regulation of TGF-beta signaling, TGF-beta also induces an increased
expression of SnoN at a later stage, which in turn binds to SMAD
heteromeric complexes and shuts off TGF-beta signaling.

SMADs mediate activin, TGF-beta, and BMP signaling from receptors to
nuclei. According to the current model, activated activin/TGF-beta
receptors phosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal serines of SMAD2 and SMAD3
(SSMS-COOH); phosphorylated SMAD2/SMAD3 oligomerizes with SMAD4,
translocates to the nucleus, and modulates transcription of defined
genes. To test key features of this model, Funaba and Mathews (2000)
explored the construction of constitutively active SMAD2 mutants. To
mimic phosphorylated SMAD2, they made 2 SMAD2 mutants with acidic amino
acid substitutions of carboxyl-terminal serines: SMAD2-2E and SMAD2-3E.
The mutants enhanced basal transcriptional activity in a mink lung
epithelial cell line, L17. In a SMAD4-deficient cell line, SMAD2-2E did
not affect basal signaling; suggesting that the constitutively active
SMAD2 mutant also requires SMAD4 for function. Funaba and Mathews (2000)
concluded that SMAD2 phosphorylation results in both tighter binding to
SMAD4 and increased nuclear concentration; those changes may be
responsible for transcriptional activation by SMAD2.

You and Kruse (2002) studied corneal myofibroblast differentiation and
signal transduction induced by the TGFB family members activin A
(147290) and bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7; 112267). They found
that activin A induced phosphorylation of SMAD2, and BMP7 induced SMAD1
(601595), both of which were inhibited by follistatin (136470).
Transfection with antisense SMAD2/SMAD3 prevented activin-induced
expression and accumulation of alpha-smooth muscle actin. The authors
concluded that TGFB proteins have different functions in the cornea.
Activin A and TGFB1, but not BMP7, are regulators of keratocyte
differentiation and might play a role during myofibroblast
transdifferentiation. SMAD2/SMAD3 signal transduction appeared to be
important in the regulation of muscle-specific genes.

Oft et al. (2002) found that activation of Smad2 induced migration of
mouse squamous carcinoma cells, but that elevated levels of H-ras
(190020) were required for nuclear accumulation of Smad2. Elevated
levels of both were required for induction of spindle-cell
transformation and metastasis.

SMAD2 is released from cytoplasmic retention by TGFB receptor-mediated
phosphorylation and accumulates in the nucleus, where it associates with
cofactors to regulate transcription. Xu et al. (2002) uncovered direct
interactions of SMAD2 with the nucleoporins NUP214 (114350) and NUP153
(603948). These interactions mediate constitutive nucleocytoplasmic
shuttling of SMAD2. NUP214 and NUP153 compete with the cytoplasmic
retention factor SARA (603755) and the nuclear SMAD2 partner FAST1
(603621) for binding to a hydrophobic corridor on the MH2 surface of
SMAD2. TGFB receptor-mediated phosphorylation stimulates nuclear
accumulation of SMAD2 by modifying its affinity for SARA and SMAD4 but
not for NUP214 or NUP153. Thus, by directly contacting the nuclear pore
complex, SMAD2 undergoes constant shuttling, providing a dynamic pool
that is competitively drawn by cytoplasmic and nuclear signal
transduction partners.

TGFB stimulation leads to phosphorylation and activation of SMAD2 and
SMAD3, which form complexes with SMAD4 that accumulate in the nucleus
and regulate transcription of target genes. Inman et al. (2002)
demonstrated that following TGFB stimulation of epithelial cells,
receptors remain active for at least 3 to 4 hours, and continuous
receptor activity is required to maintain active SMADs in the nucleus
and for TGFB-induced transcription. Continuous nucleocytoplasmic
shuttling of the SMADs during active TGFB signaling provides the
mechanism whereby the intracellular transducers of the signal
continuously monitor receptor activity. These data explain how, at all
times, the concentration of active SMADs in the nucleus is directly
dictated by the levels of activated receptors in the cytoplasm.

Using Xenopus embryo explants, whole zebrafish embryos, and mammalian
cell lines, Batut et al. (2007) showed that phosphorylation and nuclear
accumulation of Smad2 required an intact microtubule network and the
ATPase activity of the kinesin motor. Smad2 interacted directly with the
kinesin-1 light chain subunit (KLC2), and interfering with kinesin
activity in Xenopus and zebrafish embryos phenocopied loss of Nodal
(601265) signaling.

Davis et al. (2008) demonstrated that induction of a contractile
phenotype in human vascular smooth muscle cells by TGF-beta (190180) and
BMPs is mediated by miR21 (611020). miR21 downregulates PDCD4 (608610),
which in turn acts as a negative regulator of smooth muscle contractile
genes. Surprisingly, TGF-beta and BMP signaling promoted a rapid
increase in expression of mature miR21 through a posttranscriptional
step, promoting the processing of primary transcripts of miR21
(pri-miR21) into precursor miR21 (pre-miR21) by the Drosha complex (see
608828). TGF-beta and BMP-specific SMAD signal transducers SMAD1, SMAD2,
SMAD3 (603109), and SMAD5 (603110) are recruited to pri-miR21 in a
complex with the RNA helicase p68 (DDX5; 180630), a component of the
Drosha microprocessor complex. The shared cofactor SMAD4 (600993) is not
required for this process. Thus, Davis et al. (2008) concluded that
regulation of microRNA biogenesis by ligand-specific SMAD proteins is
critical for control of the vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype and
potentially for SMAD4-independent responses mediated by the TGF-beta and
BMP signaling pathways.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Wu et al. (2000) determined the crystal structure of a SMAD2 MH2 domain
in complex with the SMAD-binding domain of SARA at 2.2-angstrom
resolution.

Wu et al. (2001) determined the crystal structure of a phosphorylated
SMAD2 at 1.8-angstrom resolution. The structure revealed the formation
of a homotrimer mediated by the C-terminal phosphoserine residues. The
phosphoserine-binding surface on the MH2 domain, which is frequently
targeted for inactivation in cancers, is highly conserved among the
comediator SMADs (Co-SMADs) and receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs). This
finding, together with mutagenesis data, pinpointed a functional
interface between SMAD2 and SMAD4. In addition, the
phosphoserine-binding surface on the MH2 domain coincides with the
surface on R-SMADs that is required for docking interactions with the
serine-phosphorylated receptor kinases. These observations defined a
bifunctional role for the MH2 domain as a
phosphoserine-X-phosphoserine-binding module in receptor ser/thr kinase
signaling pathways.

GENE STRUCTURE

Takenoshita et al. (1998) determined the structure of the human MADH2
gene and characterized the 5-prime and 3-prime ends of MADH2 mRNAs. The
MADH2 gene contains 12 exons, the first 2 (1a and 1b) of which are
alternatively spliced such that they are used singly or in combination.
In addition, RT-PCR showed that the fourth exon (exon 3), which encodes
30 amino acids, is spliced out in about 10% of MADH2 transcripts. The
authors found that MADH2 mRNAs are transcribed from 2 different
promoters located in 1 CpG island. The 3-prime ends of MADH2 mRNAs are
heterogeneous, and Takenoshita et al. (1998) identified several
polyadenylation signals.

MAPPING

Eppert et al. (1996) mapped the MADR2 gene close to DPC4 at 18q21, a
region which is frequently deleted in colorectal cancers. Riggins et al.
(1996) mapped the human MADH2 gene to 18q21. Nakao et al. (1997) refined
the localization of the SMAD2 gene to 18q21.1, approximately 3 Mb
proximal to DPC4, by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

In a screen of 66 sporadic colorectal carcinomas, Eppert et al. (1996)
identified 4 missense mutations in MADR2, 2 of which were associated
with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 1 allele. These mutations were
associated with loss of protein expression or loss of TGF-beta-regulated
phosphorylation. Eppert et al. (1996) proposed that MADR2 is a tumor
suppressor gene and that mutations acquired in colorectal cancer may
function to disrupt TGF-beta signaling.

Riggins et al. (1996) evaluated JV18-1 in a panel of 18 colorectal
cancer cell lines, each containing allelic loss of the minimally lost
region on chromosome 18q. RT-PCR studies revealed JV18-1 expression in
normal colon, normal brain, and in 17 of 18 colorectal tumors. They
identified 1 tumor in which there was a homozygous deletion of JV18-1
sequences. The deletion in this tumor did not extend proximally to
include D18S535 or distally to DPC4. In another tumor, a smaller protein
encoded by JV18-1 was present. The protein was shorter because of a
deletion extending from codons 345 to 358. This deletion was somatic in
origin. Riggins et al. (1996) concluded that this gene family may be
important in the suppression of neoplasia, since its members transduce
growth inhibitory signals from TGF-beta.

By PCR-SSCP analysis of the entire coding region of the SMAD2 gene using
intron-based primers, Takenoshita et al. (1998) screened genomic DNA
sequences of colorectal cancers for mutations of the SMAD2 gene.
Although no mutations were found within any exon of SMAD2, 2 of 60
sporadic colorectal cancers displayed deletions in the polypyrimidine
tract preceding exon 4. Deletions of this region were also detected in
colon cancer cell lines, and were clustered within cells exhibiting
microsatellite instability. Deletions in the polypyrimidine tract had no
effect on the splicing of the SMAD2 gene in these cases; however, the
polypyrimidine tract in the splicing acceptor site may be a target for
mutations in mismatch repair-deficient tumors.

Takagi et al. (1998) carried out mutation analyses of the SMAD2 gene on
cDNA sampled from 36 primary colorectal cancer specimens. Only 1
missense mutation (2.8%), producing an amino acid substitution in the
highly conserved region, and 2 homozygous deletions (5.5%) of the total
coding region of SMAD2 gene were detected. They concluded that the SMAD2
gene may play a role as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in a small
fraction of colorectal cancers. Even in combination with changes in
SMAD4, the observed frequency was not sufficient to account for all
18q21 deletions in colorectal cancers. Thus, another tumor suppressor
gene, such as DCC (120470), discovered as the first tumor suppressor
candidate in the region, may exist in the 18q21 region where LOH is
often seen.

Using cDNA, Roth et al. (2000) conducted mutation analysis of the SMAD2,
SMAD3, and SMAD4 genes in 14 Finnish kindreds with hereditary
nonpolyposis colon cancer (see 120435). They found no mutations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Waldrip et al. (1998) studied the effect of Smad2 in mouse embryonic
development by targeted disruption of the mouse Smad2 gene using
embryonic stem cell technology. They found that Smad2 function was not
required for mesoderm production per se, but, rather unexpectedly, in
the absence of Smad2, the entire epiblast adopts a mesodermal fate
giving rise to a normal yolk sac and fetal blood cells. In contrast,
Smad2 mutant mouse embryos entirely lacked tissues of the embryonic germ
layers. Waldrip et al. (1998) concluded that Smad2 signals serve to
restrict the site of primitive streak formation and establish
anterior-posterior identity within the epiblast. Chimera experiments
demonstrated that these essential activities are contributed by the
extraembryonic tissues. Thus, the extraembryonic tissues play critical
roles in establishing the body plan during early mouse development.

NOMENCLATURE

Derynck et al. (1996) proposed a revised nomenclature for the
Mad-related products and genes that are implicated in signal
transduction by members of the TGF-beta family. As the root symbol they
proposed SMAD, which is a merger of Sma (the gene in C. elegans) and
Mad. SMAD serves to differentiate these proteins from unrelated gene
products previously called MAD (see 600021). JV18.1 became SMAD2 in
their nomenclature.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
SMAD2, IVS6, G-A, +1

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to heterotaxy (see 306955) has not been confirmed.

In a patient with dextrocardia, unbalanced complete atrioventricular
canal defect, and pulmonary stenosis, Zaidi et al. (2013) identified a
heterozygous de novo splice site mutation in intron 6 of the SMAD2 gene
(p.IVS6+1G-A). The patient also had unbalanced double-outlet right
ventricle, dextroposition of the great arteries, atrial septal defect,
and asplenia. Height and weight were at the 95th and 10th percentile,
respectively. Neurologic development was normal. The patient was
identified in a cohort of 362 parent-child trios comprising a child with
severe congenital heart disease and no first-degree relative with
identified structural heart disease.

.0002
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
SMAD2, TRP244CYS

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to heterotaxy (see 306955) has not been confirmed.

In a patient with dextrocardia, unbalanced right-dominant complete
atrioventricular canal defect, and pulmonary stenosis, Zaidi et al.
(2013) identified a heterozygous de novo missense mutation in the SMAD2
gene (trp244 to cys; W244C). The patient also had left superior vena
cava to left atrium, partial anomalous pulmonary venous return,
double-outlet right ventricle, abnormal nose, foot syndactyly, and gut
malrotation. Height and weight were at the 50th percentile for each.
Information on neurodevelopment was not available. The patient was
identified in a cohort of 362 parent-child trios comprising a child with
severe congenital heart disease and no first-degree relative with
identified structural heart disease.

614405	TITLE *614405 DEAH BOX POLYPEPTIDE 33; DHX33
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the DEAD/DEAH box family of RNA helicases, such as DHX33,
modify the higher-order structure of RNA through hydrolysis of ATP or
other nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). These enzymes have a role in RNA
transcription, RNA editing, pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, and
RNA decay (summary by Zhang et al., 2011).

CLONING

Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is transcribed by RNA polymerase I (see POLR1B;
602000) as a 47S polycistronic precursor that is processed into mature
18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNAs. Using an RNA interference screen to identify
DDX/DHX enzymes that perturb rRNA transcription in human fibroblasts,
Zhang et al. (2011) identified DHX33. The deduced protein contains an
N-terminal ATP/NTP-binding domain, a central ATP/NTPase domain, and
C-terminal helicase and ATP/NTP hydrolysis-dependent substrate
interaction motifs. Fractionation of a human breast cancer cell line and
human and mouse fibroblasts, as well as immunohistochemical analysis,
revealed that DHX33 localized predominantly with markers of nucleoli,
with some localization in nucleoplasm. Following dispersal of nucleoli
during the cell cycle, DHX33 followed nucleolar proteins to nucleolar
organizing regions.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2011) found that knockdown of DHX33 in human cell lines
inhibited rRNA transcription and processing, reduced the size of
nucleoli, caused nucleolar stress, and initiated a p53 (TP53;
191170)-dependent stress response that included cell cycle arrest and
induction of p21 (CDKN1A; 116899). Mutation analysis revealed that lys94
(K94) within the catalytic domain of DHX33 was crucial for rRNA
transcription. DHX33 deficiency reduced recruitment of the large RNA
polymerase subunit RPA194 (POLR1A) to rDNA loci and reduced
phosphorylation of UBF (UBTF; 600673), which is required for RNA
polymerase I activity. Overexpression of wildtype DHX33, but not DHX33
with a K94 mutation, in human cell lines stimulated 47S synthesis.
Overexpression of DHX33 with deletion of its putative DNA-binding domain
also reduced rRNA synthesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of
human breast cancer cells revealed that DHX33, like RPA194, occupied the
entire rDNA promoter and transcribed regions, and binding required the
DNA-binding motif of DHX33. DHX33 also immunoprecipitated with UBF.
Zhang et al. (2011) concluded that DHX33 has a critical role in cell
growth and rRNA synthesis.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the DHX33 gene to chromosome 17p13.2 based on an
alignment of the DHX33 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AL359945) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hsieh et al. (1991) identified the G7a gene, encoding human valyl-tRNA
synthetase, within the class III region of the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC). Hsieh and Campbell (1991) cloned a VARS cDNA encoding a
deduced 1,265-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 140,457 Da.
Comparison of the amino acid sequence with those in protein databases
showed 38 to 48% identity to valyl-tRNA of bacteria and yeast.

MAPPING

Hsieh et al. (1991) identified the G7a gene (VARS) in a 680-kb segment
of DNA within the class III region of the MHC on chromosome 6p21.3.

HISTORY

The assignment of another valyl-tRNA synthetase gene, previously
designated VARS1, to chromosome 9 by Walter et al. (1987) was found to
be in error.

608385	TITLE *608385 TENSIN 4; TNS4
;;C-TERMINAL TENSIN-LIKE PROTEIN; CTEN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes sharing similarity with tensin-1 (600076) and
tensin-2 (607717), followed by RACE, Lo and Lo (2002) cloned CTEN. The
deduced 715-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 76.9
kD. The C terminus of CTEN shares 50% and 45% amino acid identity with
the C termini of tensin-1 and tensin-2, respectively. Like these
proteins, CTEN contains Src homology-2 and phosphotyrosine-binding
domains, but it lacks the N-terminal actin-binding domain. CTEN also has
6 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis of
several tissues detected a 4.4-kb transcript only in prostate and
placenta. Endogenous CTEN expressed by a nontransformed prostate
epithelial cell line and CTEN synthesized by in vitro transcription and
translation both had an apparent molecular mass of about 90 kD by
SDS-PAGE. Immunofluorescence staining localized CTEN to focal adhesions
in prostate epithelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Lo and Lo (2002) found that expression of CTEN was reduced or lost in
several prostate cancers and in prostate cancer cell lines.

Katz et al. (2007) found that EGF (131530) downregulated expression of
tensin-3 (TNS3; 606825) and concomitantly upregulated expression of CTEN
in HeLa cells and human breast carcinoma cells. Knockdown of CTEN or
tensin-3 impaired or enhanced mammary cell migration, respectively.
Furthermore, CTEN displaced tensin-3 from the cytoplasmic tail of
integrin beta-1 (ITGB1; 135630), thereby inducing actin fiber
disassembly. In invasive breast cancer, CTEN expression correlated with
high EGFR (131550) and HER2 (ERBB2; 164870) expression and with
metastasis to lymph nodes. Moreover, treatment of inflammatory breast
cancer patients with an EGFR/HER2 inhibitor significantly downregulated
CTEN expression. Katz et al. (2007) concluded that a transcriptional
tensin-3-CTEN switch may contribute to metastasis of mammary cancer.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lo and Lo (2002) determined that the CTEN gene contains 12 exons and
spans about 21 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lo and Lo (2002) mapped the CTEN gene to
chromosome 17q12-q21.

ENOLASE, MUSCLE-SPECIFIC; MSE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Peshavaria and Day (1991) determined that the ENO3 gene encodes a
deduced 433-amino acid protein.

MAPPING

Chen and Giblett (1976) and Pearce et al. (1976) presented evidence for
3 enolase loci. By in situ hybridization studies using a probe for ENO2
(131360), Craig et al. (1989) found small aggregates of grains at
1pter-p36, the site of ENO1 (172430), and some at 17pter-p12.

Feo et al. (1990) mapped the muscle-specific beta-enolase (ENO3) to
chromosome 17pter-p11 by analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids
and transfectant cell lines carrying different portions of chromosome
17. This muscle-specific enzyme maps to the region encoding the gene
cluster for the sarcomeric myosin heavy chains (MYH1; 160730).

GENE STRUCTURE

Peshavaria and Day (1991) determined that the ENO3 gene contains 12
exons and spans approximately 6 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a man with glycogen storage disease XIII (GSD13; 612932), Comi et al.
(2001) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ENO3
gene (G156D, 131370.0001; G374E, 131370.0002). Immunohistochemistry and
immunoblotting detected dramatically reduced beta-enolase protein in
this patient, while alpha-enolase was normally represented.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The KHSRP gene encodes a multifunctional RNA-binding protein implicated
in a variety of cellular processes, including transcription, alternative
pre-mRNA splicing, and mRNA localization (Min et al., 1997; Gherzi et
al., 2004).

CLONING

The pre-mRNA of the protooncogene SRC (190090) contains an 18-nucleotide
exon, N1, that is spliced into the mRNA in neuronal cells but is
excluded in nonneuronal cells. N1 exon inclusion in neurons is under the
positive control of an intronic regulatory sequence called the
downstream control sequence (DCS). Using neuronal cell extracts, Min et
al. (1995) isolated a complex that assembles specifically onto DCS RNA
and that is required for N1 exon splicing in vitro. UV-crosslinking
experiments identified HNRNPF (601037), a neuron-specific 75-kD protein
(p75) doublet, and 4 non-cell-type-specific proteins as components of
the DCS complex. By PCR of cDNA from a neuronal cell line using
degenerate primers based on a partial p75 protein sequence, Min et al.
(1997) isolated a partial p75 cDNA. They screened cDNA and genomic
libraries and identified additional clones corresponding to the entire
p75 coding region. The predicted 711-amino acid protein contains a
proline/glycine-rich N terminus and a C-terminal domain that is rich in
proline, glycine, alanine, and glutamine. The central region contains 4
tandemly repeated KH domains (see 602449), leading the authors to rename
the protein 'KH-type splicing regulatory protein' (KSRP). Using Northern
and Western blot analysis, Min et al. (1997) demonstrated that KSRP is
expressed in both neuronal and nonneuronal cells, although it is
approximately 3-fold more abundant in neuronal cells. They stated that
the neuronal cell-specific crosslinking observed must arise from factors
other than the relative levels of KSRP in various cell types.

Davis-Smyth et al. (1996) identified KSRP (which they called FBP2) and
FBP3 (FUBP3; 603536) as proteins related to the far upstream
element-binding protein FBP1 (FUBP1; 603444). All 3 proteins had the
same general architecture, with 3 distinct domains including a central
nucleic acid-binding region containing KH motifs.

GENE FUNCTION

Min et al. (1997) identified KSRP as part of a complex that assembles
onto DCS RNA and is required for splicing of the N1 exon of SRC in
vitro. Antibodies against KSRP inhibited both the assembly of the DCS
complex and the in vitro splicing of the N1 exon. The KSRP antibodies
did not bind to complexes already assembled onto the DCS. Instead, they
blocked the complexes from assembling.

Davis-Smyth et al. (1996) found that the FBPs, including FBP2, each
bound specifically to 1 strand of the far upstream element (FUSE)
originally identified upstream of MYC (190080), and each possessed a
potent C-terminal activation domain.

AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3-prime UTR of inherently unstable mRNAs
act as instability determinants by interacting with ARE-binding proteins
that promote mRNA decay. Using human cell lines, Gherzi et al. (2004)
demonstrated that KSRP is an essential factor for ARE-directed mRNA
decay. Some of the KH motifs of KSRP directly mediated RNA binding, mRNA
decay, and interactions with the exosome and poly(A) ribonuclease (PARN;
604212). The ability of KH domains to promote mRNA decay correlated with
their ability to bind ARE and associate with RNA-degrading enzymes.
Gherzi et al. (2004) concluded that the KH domains of KSRP promote rapid
mRNA decay by recruiting degradation machinery to ARE-containing mRNAs.

Briata et al. (2005) found that Ksrp underwent p38 (MAPK14;
600289)-dependent phosphorylation during differentiation in a mouse
myogenic cell line. Phosphorylated Ksrp displayed compromised ability to
bind ARE-containing transcripts and failed to promote their rapid decay,
although it retained the ability to interact with the mRNA degradation
machinery. Overexpression of Ksrp selectively impaired induction of
ARE-containing early myogenic transcripts, but it did not affect
p38-mediated transcriptional responses. Briata et al. (2005) concluded
that KSRP provides a biochemical link between differentiation-activated
p38 signaling and turnover of myogenic mRNAs.

In studies in mouse neuroblastoma cells (N2a), Tadesse et al. (2008)
found that KSRP is an arginine-methylated protein and interacts directly
with the tudor domain of SMN (600354). The binding was abolished by
mutations in the tudor domain of SMN found in patients with severe
spinal muscular atrophy (SMA; 253300). In normal cells, KSRP and SMN
colocalized in differentiating neuronal processes, but not in the
nucleus. KSRP was found to be arginine methylated by CARM1 (603934), and
this methylation was necessary for the interaction with SMN and for
normal localization of KSRP. The absence of SMN resulted in
misregulation of KSRP and concomitant increased mRNA stability of the
target protein CDKN1A (116899) in mouse spinal cord. The findings
indicated that SMN can act as a molecular chaperone for methylated
proteins involved in RNA metabolism, and suggested that defects in RNA
metabolism may be involved in the pathophysiology of SMA.

Trabucchi et al. (2009) showed in mammalian cells that KSRP serves as a
component of both Drosha and Dicer complexes and regulates the
biogenesis of a subset of miRNAs. KSRP binds with high affinity to the
terminal loop of the target miRNA precursors and promotes their
maturation. This mechanism is required for specific changes in target
mRNA expression that affect specific biologic programs, including
proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Trabucchi et al. (2009)
concluded that their findings revealed an unexpected mechanism that
links KSRP to the machinery regulating maturation of a cohort of miRNAs
that, in addition to its role in promoting mRNA decay, independently
serves to integrate specific regulatory programs of protein expression.

Sundaram et al. (2013) found that the FLTS1 (605547) transcript could
function either as an mRNA that was translated into the FLTS1 protein or
as a primary miRNA that was processed into miRNA-198. KSRP was required
for the switch between FLTS1 mRNA translation and MIR198 processing.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ring et al. (1999) mapped the KHSRP gene
to chromosome 19p13.3. They mapped the mouse Khsrp gene to a region of
chromosome 17 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
19p13.3.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Production of interleukin-1 (147720, 147760) and tumor necrosis factor
(TNF; see 191160) from stimulated human monocytes is inhibited by a
series of pyridinyl-imidazole compounds called CSAIDs
(cytokine-suppressive antiinflammatory drugs). These agents have shown
activity in a variety of animal models of acute and chronic
inflammation. Using radiolabeled chemical probes for radioligand binding
assays and photoaffinity labeling experiments, Lee et al. (1994)
identified, purified, cDNA-cloned, and biochemically characterized 2
CSBPs (CSAID-binding proteins) as molecular targets of
pyridinyl-imidazole cytokine inhibitors. They designated the 2 closely
related mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) CSBP1 and CSBP2.
Binding of pyridinyl-imidazole compounds inhibited CSBP kinase activity
and was directly correlated with their ability to inhibit cytokine
production, suggesting that the CSBPs are critical for cytokine
production. Lee et al. (1994) considered the 2 to be products of
alternative splicing. The 4.2-kb CSBP mRNA encodes a predicted 360-amino
acid protein and was expressed in all tissues tested. CSBP1 and CSBP2
are identical except for a 75-nucleotide stretch within the coding
region.

Han et al. (1994) cloned the mouse homolog as a protein that is tyrosine
phosphorylated as part of the protein kinase cascades induced by
endotoxic lipopolysaccharide. They named this 38-kD protein p38. As p38
is a member of the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) class of
MAPKs, Goedert et al. (1997) referred to this protein as SAPK2A.

Zervos et al. (1995) identified p38 as a human protein that interacts
with MAX protein (154950) and designated it MXI2. The MXI2 gene encodes
a 297-residue protein whose sequence indicates that it is related to the
extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK protein kinases; see
176948). MXI2 in yeast interacts with Max and with the C terminus of
c-Myc (190080). MXI2 phosphorylates MAX both in vitro and in vivo. The
authors speculated that phosphorylation by MXI2 may effect the ability
of MAX to oligomerize with itself and its partners, bind DNA, or
regulate gene expression.

GENE FUNCTION

Kumar et al. (1995) stated that CSBP1 and CSBP2 are human homologs of
the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene Hog1, which is a MAPK required for
growth under high-osmolarity conditions. They studied the function of
both proteins in yeast. CSBP1 complemented a Hog1 deletion mutant, but
CSBP2 complemented only when it contained an ala-to-val mutation (A34V)
that reduced kinase activity 3-fold. The activity of CSBP1 and CSBP2 was
dependent on Pbs2, a yeast MKK (see 602315). Salt induced CSBP1
activity, but CSBP2 was constitutively active, and constitutive
expression of CSBP2 from a high copy number plasmid was toxic.

Using coimmunoprecipitation assays, Takekawa et al. (1998) demonstrated
that PPM1A (606108) directly interacts with p38.

New et al. (1998) and Ni et al. (1998) reported that p38 phosphorylated
and activated MAPKAPK5 (606723) in vitro.

Bulavin et al. (2001) reported that p38 kinase has a critical role in
the initiation of a G2 delay after ultraviolet radiation. Inhibition of
p38 blocks the rapid initiation of this checkpoint in both human and
murine cells after ultraviolet radiation. In vitro, p38 binds and
phosphorylates CDC25B (116949) at serines 309 and 361, and CDC25C
(157680) at serine-216; phosphorylation of these residues is required
for binding to 14-3-3 proteins (see 113508). In vivo, inhibition of p38
prevents both phosphorylation of CDC25B at serine-309 and 14-3-3 binding
after ultraviolet radiation, and mutation of this site is sufficient to
inhibit the checkpoint initiation. In contrast, in vivo CDC25C binding
to 14-3-3 is not affected by p38 inhibition after ultraviolet radiation.
Bulavin et al. (2001) proposed that regulation of CDC25B phosphorylation
by p38 is a critical event for initiating the G2/M checkpoint after
ultraviolet radiation.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of gastrointestinal tract tissue with
p38-alpha as the bait, Ge et al. (2002) isolated multiple clones
encoding TAB1 (602615). Immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down analyses
indicated that TAB1 interacts with p38-alpha, but not with other MAPKs,
with or without treatment with TNF. Immunoblot analysis showed that
coexpression of TAB1 and p38-alpha enhanced autophosphorylation of
p38-alpha even in the presence of dominant-negative forms of MAP2Ks
(e.g., MAP2K3; 602315) and TAK1 (MAP3K7; 602614). The amino acids
between positions 373 and 418 of TAB1 were found to be required for
phosphorylation of p38-alpha. Expression of TLR2 (603028) caused
p38-alpha phosphorylation in the presence or absence of inhibitors,
whereas p38-alpha phosphorylation after stimulation of TLR4 (603030)
could be inhibited by mutant TAB1, suggesting that activation of
p38-alpha can be TAB1 dependent or independent. Immunoblot analysis
detected the formation of TRAF6 (602355)-TAB1-p38-alpha complexes.
Formation of these complexes could be enhanced by stimulation with
lipopolysaccharide. Ge et al. (2002) concluded that activation of
p38-alpha by a nonenzymatic adaptor protein such as TAB1 may be an
important alternative activation pathway operating in parallel with
kinase cascades in regulating intracellular signaling.

Maizels et al. (2001) investigated the activation in vivo and regulation
of the expression of components of p38 MAPK pathway during
gonadotropin-induced formation and development of the rat corpus luteum.
They postulated that the p38 MAPK pathway could serve to promote
phosphorylation of key substrates during luteal maturation, since
maturing luteal cells, thought to be cAMP-nonresponsive, nevertheless
maintain critical phosphoproteins. The p38 MAPK downstream protein
kinase target MAPK-activated protein kinase-3 (MAPKAPK3; 602130) was
newly induced at both mRNA and protein levels during luteal formation
and maturation, while mRNA and protein expression of the closely related
MAPKAPK2 (602006) diminished. MAPKAPK3-specific immune complex kinase
assays provided direct evidence that MAPKAPK3 was in an activated state
during luteal maturation in vivo. Transient transfection studies
provided direct evidence that MAPKAPK3 was capable of signaling to
activate CREB (123810) transcriptional activity, as assessed by means of
GAL4-CREB fusion protein construct coexpressed with GAL4-luciferase
reporter construct. Introduction of wildtype, but not kinase-dead
mutant, MAPKAPK3 cDNA, into a mouse ovarian cell line stimulated
GAL4-CREB-dependent transcriptional activity approximately 3-fold. The
authors concluded that MAPKAPK3 is uniquely poised to support luteal
maturation through the phosphorylation and activation of the nuclear
transcription factor CREB.

Raoul et al. (2002) showed that Fas (134637), a member of the death
receptor family, triggers cell death specifically in motor neurons by
transcriptional upregulation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS;
163731) mediated by p38 kinase. ASK1 (602448) and Daxx (603186) act
upstream of p38 in the Fas signaling pathway. The authors also showed
that synergistic activation of the NO pathway and the classic FADD
(602457)/caspase-8 (601763) cell death pathway were needed for motor
neuron cell death. No evidence for involvement of the Fas/NO pathway was
found in other cell types. Motor neurons from transgenic mice expressing
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; 105400)-linked SOD1 (147450)
mutations displayed increased susceptibility to activation of the Fas/NO
pathway. Raoul et al. (2002) emphasized that this signaling pathway was
unique to motor neurons and suggested that these cell death pathways may
contribute to motor neuron loss in ALS. Raoul et al. (2006) reported
that exogenous NO triggered expression of Fas ligand (FASL; 134638) in
cultured motoneurons. In motoneurons from ALS model mice with mutations
in the SOD1 gene, this upregulation resulted in activation of Fas,
leading through Daxx and p38 to further NO synthesis. The authors
suggested that chronic low-activation of this feedback loop may underlie
the slowly progressive motoneuron loss characteristic of ALS.

Using Western blot analysis, Waetzig et al. (2002) showed that
p38-alpha, JNKs (e.g., JNK1; 601158), and ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2
(MAPK1; 176948) were significantly activated in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; see 266600), with p38 showing the most
pronounced increase in kinase activity. However, protein expression of
p38 and JNK was only moderately altered in IBD patients compared with
controls, and ERK1/ERK2 expression was significantly downregulated.
Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that p38 expression was localized
mainly to lamina propria macrophages and neutrophils. ELISA analysis of
Crohn disease mucosal biopsy cultures showed that a p38 inhibitor
significantly reduced TNF secretion. Treatment of IBD patients in vivo
or normal human monocytes in vitro with the anti-TNF monoclonal antibody
infliximab resulted in a significant but transient increase in p38
activity, but not JNK activity. Waetzig et al. (2002) concluded that p38
signaling is involved in the pathophysiology of IBD.

Anthrax lethal toxin (LT), a critical virulence factor of Bacillus
anthracis, is a complex of lethal factor (LF) and protective antigen
(PA). PA binds to the anthrax receptor (ATR; 606410) to facilitate the
entry of LF into the cell. LT disrupts the MAPK signaling pathway in
macrophages (Park et al., 2002). Agrawal et al. (2003) showed that, in
mice, LT impairs the function of dendritic cells (DCs), inhibiting the
upregulation of costimulatory molecules, such as CD40 (109535), CD80
(112203), and CD86 (601020), as well as cytokine secretion, in response
to lipopolysaccharide stimulation. LT-exposed DCs failed to stimulate
antigen-specific T and B cells in vivo, resulting in significant
reductions of circulating IgG antibody. Western blot analysis indicated
that LF severely impairs phosphorylation of p38, ERK1, and ERK2. A
cocktail of synthetic MAPK inhibitors inhibited cytokine production in a
manner similar to that of LF. Using a mutant form of LF lacking a
catalytic site necessary for cleavage of MEK1 (176872), MEK2 (601263),
and MEK3 (602314), the upstream activators of ERK1, ERK2, and p38,
respectively, Agrawal et al. (2003) found that cleavage of these MEKs is
essential for suppression of dendritic cell function. They proposed that
this mechanism might operate early in infection, when LT levels are low,
to impair immunity. Later in infection, Agrawal et al. (2003) noted, LT
might have quite different inflammatory effects.

During skeletal myogenesis, genomic reprogramming toward terminal
differentiation is achieved by recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes to
muscle-specific loci. Simone et al. (2004) showed that the
differentiation-activated p38 pathway targets the SWI/SNF chromatin
remodeling complex to myogenic loci. Their results identified an
unexpected function of differentiation-activated p38 in converting
external cues into chromatin modifications at discrete loci, by
selectively targeting SWI/SNF to muscle regulatory elements.

Pokholok et al. (2006) presented evidence that most mitogen-activated
protein kinases and protein kinase A subunits become physically
associated with the genes that they regulate in the yeast (S.
cerevisiae) genome. The ability to detect this interaction of signaling
kinases with target genes can be used to more precisely and
comprehensively map the regulatory circuit that eukaryotic cells use to
respond to their environment.

Thornton et al. (2008) demonstrated that p38 MAPK inactivates GSK3-beta
(605004) by direct phosphorylation at its C terminus, and this
inactivation can lead to an accumulation of beta-catenin (116806). p38
MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of GSK3-beta occurs primarily in the brain
and thymocytes. Thornton et al. (2008) concluded that activation of
beta-catenin-mediated signaling through GSK3-beta inhibition provides a
potential mechanism for p38 MAPK-mediated survival in specific tissues.

Lauchle et al. (2009) showed that MEK inhibitors are ineffective in
myeloproliferative disorder, but induce objective regression of many Nf1
(613113)-deficient acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs; 601626) in mice. Drug
resistance developed because of outgrowth of AML clones that were
present before treatment. Lauchle et al. (2009) cloned clone-specific
retroviral integrations to identify candidate resistance genes including
Rasgrp1 (603962), Rasgrp4 (607320), and Mapk14, which encodes p38-alpha.
Functional analysis implicated increased RasGRP1 levels and reduced p38
kinase activity in resistance to MEK inhibitors. Lauchle et al. (2009)
concluded that their approach represented a robust strategy for
identifying genes and pathways that modulate how primary cancer cells
respond to targeted therapeutics and for probing mechanisms of de novo
and acquired resistance.

Spinal muscle atrophy (SMA1; 253300) is an autosomal recessive
neurodegenerative disease, which is characterized by progressive muscle
atrophy due to mutations or deletion of the SMN1 (600354) gene, which
encodes survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Farooq et al. (2009)
reported a significant induction in SMN mRNA and protein following p38
activation by anisomycin. Anisomycin activation of p38 caused a rapid
cytoplasmic accumulation of HuR (ELAVL1; 603466), an RNA binding
protein, that bound to and stabilized the AU-rich element within the SMN
transcript. The stabilization of SMN mRNA, rather than transcriptional
induction, resulted in an increase in SMN protein. Farooq et al. (2009)
speculated that identification and characterization of p38 pathway
activators may be potential therapeutic compounds for the treatment of
SMA.

Lee et al. (2011) found that p38 phosphorylated the short isoform of
Xbp1 (194355) in obese and diabetic mice and enhanced Xbp1 nuclear
translocation and activity. Activation of Xbp1 resulted in relief of
endoplasmic reticulum stress and establishment of euglycemia.

MAPPING

Lee et al. (1994) stated that Southern blots suggested that CSBP1 and
CSBP2 are encoded by a single gene on human chromosome 6.

McDonnell et al. (1995) used PCR to screen genomic DNAs from a panel of
human/rodent somatic cell hybrids and map the MAPK14 gene to human
chromosome 6. They used a genomic clone in fluorescence in situ
hybridization to refine the assignment to a site at the boundary between
bands 6p21.2 and 6p21.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tamura et al. (2000) investigated a role for Mapk14 in mouse development
and physiology by targeted disruption of the Mapk14 gene. Whereas some
Mapk14 -/- embryos died between embryonic days 11.5 and 12.5, those that
developed past this stage had normal morphology but were anemic, owing
to failed definitive erythropoiesis caused by diminished expression of
the erythropoietin gene (EPO; 133170). Since Mapk14-deficient
hematopoietic stem cells reconstituted lethally irradiated hosts, Mapk14
function is not required downstream of the Epo receptor (EPOR; 133171).
Inhibition of MAPK14 activity also interfered with stabilization of EPO
mRNA in human hepatoma cells undergoing hypoxic stress. The authors
concluded that MAPK14 plays a critical role linking developmental and
stress-induced erythropoiesis through regulation of EPO expression.

MAPK14 is activated in response to many cellular stresses and also
regulates the differentiation and/or survival of various cell types in
vitro, including skeletal muscle cells and cardiomyocytes. Adams et al.
(2000) showed that targeted inactivation of the mouse Mapk14 gene
results in embryonic lethality at midgestation correlating with a
massive reduction of the myocardium and malformation of blood vessels in
the head region; however, this defect appeared to be secondary to
insufficient oxygen and nutrient transfer across the placenta. When the
placental defect was rescued, Mapk14 -/- embryos developed to term and
were normal in appearance. These results indicated that MAPK14 is
required for placental organogenesis but is not essential for other
aspects of mammalian embryonic development.

Liao et al. (2001) studied the effects of p38 MAP kinase on the intact
heart in transgenic mice. They achieved targeted activation of p38 MAP
kinase in ventricular myocytes in vivo by using a gene-switch transgenic
strategy with activated mutants of upstream kinases MKK3bE (602315) and
MKK6bE (601254). Transgene expression resulted in significant induction
of p38 MAP kinase activity and premature death at 7 to 9 weeks. Both
groups of transgenic hearts exhibited marked interstitial fibrosis and
expression of fetal marker genes characteristic of cardiac failure, but
no significant hypertrophy at the organ level. Echocardiographic and
pressure-volume analyses revealed a similar extent of systolic
contractile depression and restrictive diastolic abnormalities related
to markedly increased passive chamber stiffness. However,
MKK3bE-expressing hearts had increased end-systolic chamber volumes and
a thinned ventricular wall, associated with heterogeneous myocyte
atrophy, whereas MKK6bE hearts had reduced end-diastolic ventricular
cavity size, a modest increase in myocyte size, and no significant
myocyte atrophy. These data provided in vivo evidence for a negative
inotropic and restrictive diastolic effect from p38 MAP kinase
activation in ventricular myocytes and revealed specific roles of the
p38 pathway in the development of ventricular end-systolic remodeling.

Using a forward genetic screen of C. elegans mutants, Kim et al. (2002)
showed that viable worms lacking esp2 and esp8, homologs of the
mammalian MAP kinases SEK1 (MAP2K4; 601335) and ASK1 (MAP3K5; 602448),
were highly susceptible to and died more rapidly from both a
gram-negative bacterium, P. aeruginosa, and a gram-positive organism, E.
faecalis, than wildtype worms. RNA-interference and biochemical analyses
likewise implicated the p38 MAP kinase homolog, pmk1, in susceptibility
to these pathogens. Kim et al. (2002) concluded that MAP kinase
signaling, which is also involved in plant pathogen resistance, is a
conserved element in innate metazoan immunity to diverse pathogens.

By transferring purified IgG from patients with pemphigus vulgaris (PV;
169610), an autoimmune blistering skin disease characterized by
acantholysis, into neonatal mice, Anhalt et al. (1982) developed an
animal model of the disease. Berkowitz et al. (2006) found that
inhibition of p38 prevented the development of disease in mice with
IgG-induced PV. In human keratinocyte cultures, inhibitors of p38
prevented IgG-induced changes in the cytoskeleton associated with loss
of cell-cell adhesion.

Hui et al. (2007) found that mouse embryos lacking Mapk14 developed to
term but died shortly after birth with lung dysfunction and infiltration
of the lung with hematopoietic cells. Fetal hematopoietic cells and
embryonic fibroblasts deficient in Mapk14 showed increased proliferation
resulting from sustained activation of the Jnk (601158)-Jun (165160)
pathway. Mice with liver-specific deletion of Mapk14 showed enhanced
hepatocyte proliferation and enhanced chemical-induced liver cancer that
correlated with upregulation of the Jnk-Jun pathway. Furthermore,
inactivation of Jnk or Jun suppressed the increased proliferation of
Mapk14-deficient hepatocytes and tumor cells.

Ventura et al. (2007) showed that p38 deletion in adult mice resulted in
increased proliferation and defective differentiation of lung stem and
progenitor cells both in vivo and in vitro. p38 positively regulated
factors such as Cebp (116897) that are required for lung cell
differentiation and inhibited Egfr (131550), required for proliferation.
As a consequence, inactivation of p38 led to an immature and
hyperproliferative lung epithelium that was highly sensitized to
activated Ras (190020)-induced tumorigenesis.

;;BLOC1, SUBUNIT 2; BLOS2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BLOC1S2 is a component of the ubiquitously expressed BLOC1 multisubunit
protein complex. BLOC1 is required for normal biogenesis of specialized
organelles of the endosomal-lysosomal system, such as melanosomes and
platelet dense granules (Starcevic and Dell'Angelica, 2004).

CLONING

Using the BLOC1 subunit pallidin (PLDN; 604310) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Starcevic and Dell'Angelica
(2004) cloned BLOC1S2, which they called BLOS2. The deduced BLOS2
protein contains coiled-coil regions and has a calculated molecular mass
of 16 kD. Western blot analysis detected endogenous HeLa cell BLOS2 at
an apparent molecular mass of 18 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By mass spectrometry of BLOC1 proteins purified from bovine liver, mouse
liver, and HeLa cells, Starcevic and Dell'Angelica (2004) identified
BLOS2 as a subunit of BLOC1. Other BLOC1 subunits identified were
pallidin, muted (607289), dysbindin (DTNBP1; 607145), cappuccino
(605695), snapin (SNAPAP; 607007), BLOC1S1 (601444), and BLOC1S3
(609762). Coimmunoprecipitation and yeast 2-hybrid analyses confirmed
that these proteins interact within the BLOC1 complex.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the BLOC1S2
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP RH47426).

606847	TITLE *606847 TCOF1 GENE; TCOF1
;;TREACLE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By positional cloning, the Treacher Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group
(1996) identified a novel gene of unknown function, which they
designated treacle, within the Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS; 154500)
critical region at 5q. Northern blot analysis indicated that the gene is
expressed in a variety of fetal and adult tissues. Dixon et al. (1997)
isolated the coding sequence of the gene, designated TCOF1, and
determined that it encodes a low complexity, serine/alanine-rich protein
of approximately 144 kD. The deduced 1,411-amino acid protein has 3
domains with unique N and C termini and a large central repeat domain.
Wise et al. (1997) showed that the repeat protein motifs are shared with
nucleolar trafficking proteins in other species and are predicted to be
highly phosphorylated by casein kinase II (115440). Consistent with
this, the full-length TCOF1 protein sequence also contains putative
nuclear and nucleolar localization signals.

So et al. (2004) identified 1 major and 2 minor in-frame splice variants
of treacle that differed from the transcript reported by the Treacher
Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group (1996). The major variant includes
an additional 231-nucleotide exon, 6A, which introduces an additional
repeat of alternating basic and acidic regions and a novel functional
monopartite nuclear localization signal (KRAKK). The deduced protein
contains 1,488 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 152
kD. Northern blot analysis of HeLa cells detected this variant at about
5.5 kb. RT-PCR detected 1.5- to 3.7-fold higher expression of variants
containing exon 6A than those lacking this exon in all human tissues and
cell lines examined. The 2 minor variants identified by So et al. (2004)
include one containing a different additional exon (16A) and the other
lacking exon 19.

Dixon et al. (1997) isolated the murine homolog of the TCOF1 gene and
showed that it encodes a protein of 133 kD. Interspecies comparison
indicated that the proteins display 61.5% identity, with the level of
conservation being greatest in the regions of acidic/basic amino acid
repeats and nuclear localization signals. These features are shared with
the nucleolar phosphoproteins. Confirmation that the gene isolated was
orthologous with the Treacher Collins syndrome gene was provided by the
demonstration that it mapped to central mouse chromosome 18 in a region
of conserved synteny with 5q21-q33. The gene was found to be expressed
in a wide variety of embryonic and adult tissues of the mouse. So et al.
(2004) examined mouse Tcof1 transcripts and identified a variant
containing an additional exon (16A).

GENE STRUCTURE

Gladwin et al. (1996) defined the intron-exon structure of the TCOF1
gene, identified 7 exons, and derived intronic sequences. Wise et al.
(1997) reported the complete exon/intron genomic structure of the TCOF1
gene and its complete coding sequence. The TCOF1 gene contains 26 exons.

So et al. (2004) identified 2 additional exons within the TCOF1 gene:
exon 6A and exon 16A. The sequence containing exon 6A transcribes the
major TCOF1 isoform.

MAPPING

The Treacher Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group (1996) found that the
treacle gene (TCOF1), which is mutant in Treacher Collins syndrome, is
located on chromosome 5q in a gene-rich region of the human genome.
DTDST (606718), CSF1R, PDGFRB (173410), and CDX1 (600746) are within
approximately 900 kb proximal of the TCOF1 locus, determined by a
combination of radiation hybrid and YAC/cosmid contig analysis. The same
process demonstrated that DHLAG, RPS14, HSST (600853), GPX3 (138321),
and ANX6 are distal to TCOF1. Moreover, a large number of additional
genes of unknown function had been mapped to the region.

GENE FUNCTION

The Treacher Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group (1996) stated that the
clinical phenotype of Treacher Collins syndrome suggests that the
responsible gene plays a fundamental role in early embryonic
development, particularly in development of the craniofacial complex.
Dixon et al. (1997) observed that peak levels of expression in the
developing mouse embryo were present at the edges of the neural folds
immediately before fusion, and also in the developing branchial arches
at the time of critical morphogenetic events. Dixon et al. (1997)
commented that these observations support a role for the gene in the
development of the craniofacial complex and provide further evidence
that the gene encodes a protein that may be involved in
nucleolar-cytoplasmic transport.

Jones et al. (1999) used treacle fusion peptides to demonstrate that the
region encoded by exon 9 is phosphorylated in vitro by both casein
kinase II and protein kinase C (see 176960). Furthermore, they found
such a kinase activity to be present in protein extracts from several
embryonic avian tissues, including branchial arches I and II.

Using database mining and protein structural prediction programs, Emes
and Ponting (2001) identified a sequence motif in the products of genes
mutated in Miller-Dieker lissencephaly (LIS1; 601545), Treacher Collins,
oral-facial-digital type 1 (CXORF5; 300170), and ocular albinism with
late-onset sensorineural deafness (TBL1X; 300196) syndromes. Over 100
eukaryotic intracellular proteins were found to possess a LIS1 homology
motif, including several katanin p60 (606696) subunits, muskelin
(605623), Nopp140 (602394), the plant proteins tonneau and LEUNIG, slime
mold protein aimless, and numerous WD repeat-containing beta-propeller
proteins. The authors suggested that LIS1 homology motifs may contribute
to the regulation of microtubule dynamics, either by mediating
dimerization, or else by binding cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain (600112)
or microtubules directly. The predicted secondary structure of LIS1
homology motifs, and their occurrence in homologs of G-beta
beta-propeller subunits, suggests that they are analogs of G-gamma
subunits, and might associate with the periphery of beta-propeller
domains. The finding of LIS1 homology motifs in both treacle and Nopp140
reinforces previous observations of functional similarities between
these nucleolar proteins.

Valdez et al. (2004) showed that treacle is involved in ribosomal DNA
gene transcription by interacting with upstream binding factor (UBF;
600673). Immunofluorescence labeling showed that treacle and UBF
colocalize to specific nucleolar organizer regions and cosegregate
within nucleolar caps of actinomycin D-treated HeLa cells; biochemical
analysis showed the association of treacle and UBF with chromatin.
Immunoprecipitation and the yeast 2-hybrid system both suggested
physical interaction of the 2 nucleolar phosphoproteins. Downregulation
of treacle expression using specific short interfering RNA (siRNA)
resulted in inhibition of ribosomal DNA transcription and cell growth. A
similar correlation was observed in Tcof1 +/- mouse embryos that
exhibited craniofacial defects and growth retardation. Valdez et al.
(2004) concluded that treacle haploinsufficiency in patients with
Treacher Collins syndrome may result in abnormal development caused by
inadequate ribosomal RNA production in the prefusion neural folds during
the early stages of embryogenesis.

Gonzales et al. (2005) showed that antisense-mediated downregulation of
Tcof1 expression in Xenopus oocytes reduced 2-prime-O-methylation of
pre-rRNA. Analysis of RNA isolated from wildtype and Tcof1 +/- mice
embryos from strains that exhibit a lethal phenotype showed significant
reduction in 2-prime-O-methylation at nucleotide 463C of 18S rRNA. There
was no significant difference in rRNA methylation between wildtype and
heterozygous embryos of DBAxBALB/c mice, which have no obvious
craniofacial phenotype. The authors proposed that the function of TCOF1
in pre-rRNA methylation is most likely mediated by its direct physical
interaction with NOP56 (614154), a component of the ribonucleoprotein
methylation complex. Although TCOF1 colocalizes with UBF throughout
mitosis, it colocalizes with NOP56 and fibrillarin (FBL; 134795), a
putative methyltransferase, only during telophase when rDNA gene
transcription and pre-rRNA methylation are known to commence. The
authors suggested that TCOF1 might link RNA polymerase I-catalyzed
transcription and posttranscriptional modification of pre-rRNA. Gonzales
et al. (2005) hypothesized that haploinsufficiency of TCOF1 in TCS
patients may result in inhibition of production of properly modified
mature rRNA in addition to inhibition of rDNA gene transcription, which
consequently affects proliferation and proper differentiation of
specific embryonic cells during development.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The Treacher Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group (1996) identified
different mutations in the TCOF1 gene in each of 5 unrelated families
with Treacher Collins syndrome. All of the mutations were predicted to
result in premature termination of the gene product.

Gladwin et al. (1996) used oligonucleotide primers designed from the
intronic sequence to amplify each exon from genomic DNA. They amplified
exons from the DNA of one affected individual from each of 33 Treacher
Collins families and screened for mutations using SSCP. They identified
mobility shifts in 4 exons. The mutations identified by Gladwin et al.
(1996) included 3 deletions (of either 1 or 2 nucleotides), an insertion
of a single nucleotide, and an unusual splicing mutation. They reported
that these 5 mutations are all different from the 5 mutations previously
reported by the Treacher Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group (1996) and
that all 10 of the mutations found in TCOF1 are nonsense or frameshift
mutations that would be predicted to result in premature termination of
the protein product. None of the TCOF1 mutations found in affected
individuals were detected on chromosomes from 200 controls. Gladwin et
al. (1996) noted that all reported mutations were unique to each family.

Dixon (1996) reviewed the clinical and molecular features of Treacher
Collins syndrome. A total of 20 mutations in the TCOF1 gene had been
identified, of which 2 were nonsense mutations, 5 were insertions, 11
were deletions, and 2 were splicing mutations. A 5-bp deletion had been
observed in 4 unrelated families. All of the mutations observed resulted
in introduction of premature termination codons into the reading frame,
suggesting haploinsufficiency as the molecular mechanism underlying the
disorder.

Edwards et al. (1997) reported several previously undescribed mutations
throughout the TCOF1 gene in patients with Treacher Collins syndrome,
bringing the total number of reported mutations to 35, which represented
a detection rate of 60%. All but one of the mutations resulted in the
introduction of a premature termination codon into the predicted
protein. Moreover, the mutations were largely family specific, although
a common 5-bp deletion in exon 24 was seen in 7 different families and a
recurrent splicing mutation in intron 3 in 2 different families. The
mutational spectrum supported the hypothesis that TCS results from
haploinsufficiency. Throughout the open reading frame, Wise et al.
(1997) detected 8 mutations in TCS families and several polymorphisms
(e.g., 154500.0003).

Splendore et al. (2000) screened 28 families with a clinical diagnosis
of Treacher Collins syndrome for mutations in the 25 coding exons of the
TCOF1 gene and their adjacent splice junctions, using SSCP and direct
sequencing. Pathogenic mutations were detected in 26 patients (93%),
bringing the number of known disease-causing mutations from 35 to 51. A
clustering of pathogenic mutations was identified. They confirmed a
previous finding that TCOF1 has an unusually high rate of
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within its coding region.

Splendore et al. (2002) found no mutations in the TCOF1 gene in 3
disorders with features overlapping those of Treacher Collins syndrome:
Goldenhar syndrome (164210), Nager syndrome (154400), and Miller
syndrome (263750).

In 33 of 60 patients (55%) with Treacher Collins syndrome, Splendore et
al. (2002) identified 31 mutations in the TCOF1 gene, 27 of which were
novel. Five exons accounted for over 50% of the mutations, with exons 23
and 24 being the main hotspots. All mutations except 1, a tyr50-to-cys
substitution (Y50C; 606847.0005), resulted in a truncated protein.

In a patient with the clinical diagnosis of Treacher Collins syndrome,
Shoo et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 2-bp deletion in the TCOF1
gene (606847.0006). The mother was clinically unaffected but the same
mutation was found in her leukocytes, hair root bulbs, buccal mucosa,
urine, and stool. Maternal grandparents did not have the mutation.
Because the mother had the mutation in cells derived from all 3 germ
layers, Shoo et al. (2004) at first suspected that the mutation was
nonpenetrant; however, they could not detect the mutation in her skin
fibroblasts, suggesting that she was mosaic.

Shows et al. (2006) reported on an infant rhesus macaque (Macaca
mulatta) that displayed the Treacher Collins syndrome phenotype and was
identified at the California National Primate Research Center. They
cloned the TCOF1 coding region from a normal rhesus macaque and
sequenced it. The rhesus homolog of TCOF1 was found to be 91.6%
identical in cDNA sequence and 93.8% identical in translated protein
sequence to human TCOF1. Sequencing of TCOF1 in the TCS-affected rhesus
macaque showed no mutations within the coding region or splice sites;
however, real-time quantitative PCR showed an 87% reduction of spleen
TCOF1 mRNA in the affected macaque when compared with normal macaque
spleen. The presumed haploinsufficiency of functional protein,
especially at the critical timepoint in development when TCOF1 is
normally expressed in large quantities to promote development of the
craniofacial skeleton, may account for the phenotype; the lower level of
mRNA was not caused by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay because a nonsense
mutation was not found in the coding region. A promoter mutation could
not be excluded.

Bowman et al. (2012) identified pathogenic sequence variants in the
TCOF1 gene in 92 (50.5%) of 182 unrelated patients with a clinical
diagnosis consistent with Treacher Collins syndrome. Of those with a
sequence change, 57% had a frameshift or mutation disrupting the start
codon, 23% had a nonsense mutation, 16% had a splice site mutation, and
4% had a missense mutation. In addition, 5.2% of patients had an
intragenic deletion of the TCOF1 gene. Thus, the majority of TCOF1
mutations lead to a loss of protein function and haploinsufficiency.

ANIMAL MODEL

Haworth et al. (2001) isolated the dog homolog of the TCOF1 gene from a
dog embryonic head/neck cDNA library. The protein shows a similar
3-domain structure to that described for human TCOF1, but the dog gene
lacks exon 10 and contains 2 exons not present in the human sequence. In
addition, exon 19 is differentially spliced in the dog. They mapped the
dog TCOF1 gene to chromosome 4q31, a region showing syntenic homology
with human chromosome 5. Genetic analysis of DNA of dogs from 13
different breeds identified 9 DNA sequence variants, 3 of which gave
rise to amino acid substitutions. Grouping dogs according to head type
showed that a 396C-T variant, leading to a pro117-to-ser amino acid
substitution, is associated with skull/face shape in this dog panel. The
numbers were small, but the association between the T allele and
brachycephaly, broad skull/short face, was highly significant (P =
0.000024). The short period of time during which the domestic dog breeds
have been established suggests that this mutation has arisen only once
in the history of dog domestication.

Dixon et al. (2006) created Tcof1 +/- mouse lines and noted that the
extent and severity of the phenotype was dependent upon the genetic
background. Tcof1 +/- neonates obtained through an intercross of DBA
Tcof1 heterozygotes and wildtype C57BL/6 mice exhibited a phenotype that
mimicked TCS. The heads of Tcof1 +/- neonates were small and dome
shaped, with anteroposterior shortening and severe frontonasal
dysplasia. Tcof1 +/- neonates displayed gasping behavior and abdominal
distention and died within 24 hour of birth. Skeletal analysis indicated
that Tcof1 +/- neonates died from respiratory arrest due to
malformations of the nasal, premaxilla, maxilla, and palatine skeletal
elements. Whole-embryo culture of wildtype and Tcof1 +/- mouse embryos
showed that Tcof1 haploinsufficiency resulted in neural crest cell
hypoplasia due to neuroepithelial-specific apoptosis. Furthermore, Dixon
et al. (2006) found that Tcof1 haploinsufficiency resulted in deficient
production of mature ribosomes, leading to apoptosis and reduced cell
proliferation.

Richter et al. (2010) used Tcof1 mutant mice to dissect the
developmental mechanisms underlying congenital hearing loss. Effective
cavitation of the middle ear was intimately linked to growth of the
auditory bulla, the neural crest cell-derived structure that
encapsulates all middle ear components, and defects in these processes
had a profoundly detrimental effect on hearing.

NOMENCLATURE

The designation 'treacle' may be best used for the protein encoded by
the TCOF1 locus. The word treacle clearly comes from Treacher Collins
and may have been devised by the British members of the collaborative
group where 'treacle' is the equivalent of the American's 'molasses.'

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, GLN252TER

In affected members of a family with Treacher Collins syndrome (154500),
the Treacher Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group (1996) found a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 703 that created a stop codon in place of a
glutamine residue, resulting in premature termination of the protein.
The mutation created a BfaI site allowing the confirmation that this
mutation was present in all of the affected but none of the unaffected
family members.

Edwards et al. (1997) stated that this gln-to-ter mutation occurred at
position 252 (Q252X).

.0002
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, 1-BP INS, 422A

Wise et al. (1997) described a patient with familial Treacher Collins
syndrome (154500) who had an insertion of a single adenine after
nucleotide 422 in exon 5 (422insA). The insertion caused a change from
histidine to glutamine at codon 141 and a change in the subsequent amino
acids, with a stop codon 33 amino acids beyond the site of the
insertion.

.0003
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, 4-BP DEL, NT497

In a patient with Treacher Collins syndrome (154500), Wise et al. (1997)
demonstrated a mutation in the TCOF1 gene that consisted of deletion of
4 bp, ATAC, after nucleotide 497 (497delATAC). The deletion caused a
change in codon 166 from asparagine to isoleucine and a change in the
downstream amino acids until the point of a stop codon 44 amino acids
beyond the deletion.

.0004
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, 5-BP DEL, NT4135

In a review of mutations in the TCOF1 gene causing Treacher Collins
syndrome (154500), Splendore et al. (2000) found that the most frequent
recurring mutation was a 5-bp deletion in exon 24 (4135-4139delGAAAA).
This mutation was reported in 7 families by Edwards et al. (1997), was
found by Splendore et al. (2000) in 6 unrelated patients, and was said
to be responsible for approximately 16% of all reported cases.

.0005
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, TYR50CYS

In a patient with sporadic Treacher Collins syndrome (154500), Splendore
et al. (2002) identified a 149A-G transition in exon 2 of the TCOF1
gene, resulting in a tyr50-to-cys (Y50C) substitution. Analysis of
parental DNA indicated that the mutation arose de novo. The mutation was
not detected in 100 control chromosomes. Splendore et al. (2002) noted
that missense mutations causing Treacher Collins syndrome are rare (most
are truncating mutations), and pointed out that human exons 1 and 2 are
highly conserved, suggesting that the N terminus of the protein is an
important functional domain.

.0006
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, 2-BP DEL, 1408AG

In a patient with the clinical diagnosis of Treacher Collins syndrome
(154500), Shoo et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 2-bp deletion,
1408delAG, in the TCOF1 gene. The mother was clinically unaffected but
the same mutation was found in her leukocytes, hair root bulbs, buccal
mucosa, urine, and stool. Maternal grandparents did not have the
mutation. Because the mother had the mutation in cells derived from all
3 germ layers, Shoo et al. (2004) at first suspected that the mutation
was nonpenetrant; however, they could not detect the mutation in her
skin fibroblasts, suggesting that she was mosaic.

.0007
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, ARG911TER

In a 5-year-old girl with Treacher Collins syndrome (154500) and
craniosynostosis, choanal atresia, and esophageal regurgitation,
Horiuchi et al. (2004) identified a de novo 2731C-T transition in exon
17 of the TCOF1 gene, resulting in an arg911-to-ter (R911X) change that
truncates the protein.

.0008
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, 18-BP DEL, NT376

In a patient with typical Treacher Collins syndrome (154500), Marszalek
et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous 18-bp deletion beginning at
nucleotide 376 within the 5-prime splice site in exon 4 of the TCOF1
gene. The deletion included 3 bp of exon 4 and 15 bp of intron 4 and
resulted in premature termination of the protein. Real-time PCR analysis
showed different melting temperatures of the amplified fragments
containing the normal allele and the mutated allele, which could be used
as a rapid screening assay. Marszalek et al. (2003) stated that the
deletion was the third largest found to date in the TCOF1 gene.

.0009
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, 1-BP DEL, 4134A

In a patient with Treacher Collins syndrome (154500), Splendore et al.
(2002) identified a 1-bp deletion (4134delA) in exon 24 of the TCOF1
gene.

In a patient with Treacher Collins syndrome who had novel craniofacial
and extracraniofacial features, Li et al. (2009) identified the same
frameshift mutation (4365delA) in the TCOF1 sequence that includes an
additional 231-nucleotide exon (6A). The mutation resulted in a
read-through of the native stop codon of the TCOF1 gene, adding more
than 80 novel amino acids to the 3-prime end of the protein. The authors
noted that the patient also had a 1535T-C transition in TCOF1, resulting
in a met512-to-thr substitution; this substitution was also present in
his unaffected mother. Unusual features in the patient included
encephalocele, marked malformation of the eyes, abnormal inner ear
structures, and several anomalies that involved the thyroid, the thymus,
the heart, an accessory spleen, ectopic adrenal gland tissue, and
underdeveloped external genitalia.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The aldo-keto reductase family includes 3-alpha-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase (3-alpha-HSD) as well as dihydrodiol dehydrogenase
(AKR1C3) and human chlordecone reductase (CHDR, or AKR1C4; 600451).
Aldo-keto reductases catalyze the conversion of aldehydes and ketones to
alcohols by utilizing NADH and/or NADPH as a cofactor. 3-Alpha-HSD is a
versatile aldo-keto reductase, able to utilize a large array of
substrates. By screening a human liver expression library with an
antibody against rat 3-alpha-HSD, Qin et al. (1993) isolated cDNAs
encoding 4 distinct human aldo-keto reductases: HAKRa (AKR1C4), HAKRb,
HAKRc (AKR1C1; 600449), and HAKRd (AKR1C2; 600450). The predicted
323-amino acid HAKR proteins share more than 85% identity. Northern blot
analysis revealed that HAKRb is expressed as 1.4- and 1.2-kb mRNAs in
several human tissues.

Nagase et al. (1995) isolated KIAA0119, an HAKRb cDNA, from a human
immature myeloid cell line. Mills et al. (1998) isolated an identical
cDNA, which they designated HAKRe.

GENE FUNCTION

Khanna et al. (1995) reported that recombinant type I (AKR1C4) and type
II (AKR1C3) human 3-alpha-HSD proteins exhibited both reductase and
dehydrogenase activities.

GENE STRUCTURE

By sequence analysis, Khanna et al. (1995) demonstrated that the AKR1C3
and AKR1C4 genes contain 9 exons and span 15 to 20 kb. The sizes and
boundaries of the exons are identical in both genes.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Nagase et al. (1995) mapped the
KIAA0119 gene to chromosome 10. Khanna et al. (1995) isolated 2 genes
encoding dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, referred to as type I or DDH1, and
type II or DDH2, as well as 1 gene for chlordecone reductase. However,
sequence analysis revealed that the type I gene of Khanna et al. (1995)
corresponded to either AKR1C1 or AKR1C2, the type II gene corresponded
to AKR1C3, and the CHDR gene corresponded to AKR1C4 (White, 1999). By a
combination of somatic cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Khanna et al. (1995) mapped all 3 genes to 10p15-p14.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Qin et al. (2006) identified a functional polymorphism in the promoter
region of the HSD17B5 gene (-71G) that may contribute to testosterone
excess in a subset of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (see
184700).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The actin cytoskeleton plays critical roles in cell morphologic changes
and motility. Rho family small GTPases, such as Rho (see 165370), RAC
(see 602048), and CDC42 (116952), organize the actin cytoskeleton. Other
major players in actin-based motility are the 7 members of the ARP2/3
complex (see 604221). The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP;
301000), WASP-like (WASL; 605056), and WASF1 are among the downstream
effector molecules involved in the transmission of signals from tyrosine
kinase receptors and small GTPases to the actin cytoskeleton.

CLONING

By sequencing random cDNAs corresponding to relatively long transcripts
from human brain, Nagase et al. (1996) identified a cDNA, which they
called KIAA0269, encoding WASF1. Sequence analysis predicted that the
WASF1 protein contains 559 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected
strong expression of WASF1 in brain, with lower expression in testis,
and weak expression in ovary, colon, kidney, pancreas, thymus, small
intestine, and peripheral blood.

By searching databases for WASP-like molecules containing the highly
conserved verprolin homology (VPH) domain, Miki et al. (1998) identified
the KIAA0269 cDNA (Nagase et al., 1996) encoding WASF1, which they
called WAVE. Sequence analysis predicted that WASF1 has no similarity to
WASP or WASL in the N terminus, through which WASP and WASL are
regulated by CDC42. The N terminus of WASF1 contains a putative leucine
zipper motif and a highly basic region. The midsequence proline-rich
region and the C-terminal VPH domain and highly acidic region of WASF1
are similar to WASP family proteins. Western blot analysis showed higher
expression of WASF1 in neuronal cell lines than in fibroblast or kidney
cell lines. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that WASF1 is expressed in
a dot-like pattern in the cytoplasm and is concentrated in RAC-regulated
membrane-ruffling areas. Mutational analysis and immunofluorescence
microscopy showed that WASF1 induces actin reorganization downstream of
RAC.

By screening a brain cDNA library using a yeast 2-hybrid system with
ARPC2 (604224) or ARPC3 (604225) as bait, Machesky and Insall (1998)
isolated a cDNA encoding WASF1, which they termed SCAR1 due to its
homology to the Dictyostelium Scar gene. Using Northern blot analysis,
Suetsugu et al. (1999) showed that the WASF1 gene is predominantly
expressed in brain as a 2.5-kb transcript.

GENE FUNCTION

Using fluorescence anisotropy analysis, Marchand et al. (2001) showed
that efficient actin nucleation requires both recruitment of an actin
monomer to the ARP2/3 complex and a subsequent activation step. The
initial steps in this pathway involve binding by the WA domain of
WASP/SCAR proteins, which consists of a WH2 motif (W) that binds to the
actin monomers and an acidic tail (A) that binds to the ARP2/3 complex.
Actin filaments seem to stimulate nucleation by enhancing binding of WA
to the ARP2/3 complex and favoring the formation of a productive
nucleus.

Eden et al. (2002) reported a mechanism by which RAC1 and the adaptor
protein NCK (600508) activate actin nucleation through WAVE1. WAVE1
exists in a heterotetrameric complex that includes orthologs of human
PIR121 (606323), NAP125 (604891), and HSPC300 (C3ORF10; 611183). Whereas
recombinant WAVE1 is constitutively active, the WAVE1 complex is
inactive. Eden et al. (2002) proposed that Rac1 and Nck cause
dissociation of the WAVE1 complex, which releases active WAVE1-HSPC300
and leads to actin nucleation. Eden et al. (2002) also determined that
ABI2 (606442) interacts with WAVE1 and appears to remain associated with
the NAP125-PIR121 subcomplex upon dissociation of the WAVE1 complex.

By immunoprecipitation of rat brain cytosol with antibodies against
WAVE1, Soderling et al. (2002) identified interaction between WAVE1 and
WRP (606525). They determined that epitope-tagged WRP colocalized with
WAVE1 and with actin at the cell cortex of transfected mouse
fibroblasts, and they colocalized when expressed in human embryonic
kidney cells. Mutation analysis revealed that trp757 in the SH3 domain
of WRP and proline-rich sequences within residues 320 to 332 and 420 to
433 of WAVE1 were required for the interaction. Recombinant WRP
stimulated intrinsic GTPase activity of Rac, but had no effect on Rho or
CDC42. WRP also reduced neurite outgrowth when transfected into rat
cerebellar granular neurons, and this effect was not dependent upon
interaction with WAVE1.

Danial et al. (2003) undertook a proteomic analysis to assess whether
BAD (603167) might participate in mitochondrial physiology. In liver
mitochondria, BAD resides in a functional holoenzyme complex together
with protein kinase A (see 176911) and protein phosphatase-1 (PP1; see
176875) catalytic units, WAVE1 as an A kinase-anchoring protein, and
glucokinase (138079). Using mitochondria from hepatocytes of
Bad-deficient mice, Danial et al. (2003) demonstrated that BAD is
required to assemble the complex, the lack of which results in
diminished mitochondria-based glucokinase activity and blunted
mitochondrial respiration in response to glucose. Glucose deprivation
results in dephosphorylation of BAD, and BAD-dependent cell death.
Moreover, Danial et al. (2003) demonstrated that the phosphorylation
status of BAD helps regulate glucokinase activity. Mice deficient in BAD
or bearing a nonphosphorylatable BAD (3SA) mutant (Datta et al., 2002)
display abnormal glucose homeostasis, including profound defects in
glucose tolerance. Danial et al. (2003) concluded that this combination
of proteomics, genetics, and physiology indicates an unanticipated role
for BAD in integrating pathways of glucose metabolism and apoptosis.

Suetsugu et al. (2003) observed that, following PDGF (see 190040)
stimulation, Wave2 (605875)-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts
displayed impaired peripheral ruffle formation, and Wave1-deficient
fibroblasts displayed impaired dorsal ruffle formation. Wave2, but not
Wave1, was essential for directed cell migration in the absence of
extracellular matrix (ECM), when cells migrated with peripheral ruffles
at the leading edge. In contrast, both Wave1 and Wave2 were essential
for invading migration into ECM, suggesting that the leading edge in ECM
has characteristics of both ruffles. In dorsal ruffles, Wave1
colocalized with ECM-degrading enzyme Mmp2 (120360), which was required
for Wave1-dependent migration, but not Wave2-dependent migration.

Kim et al. (2006) demonstrated that Wave1 is phosphorylated at multiple
sites by cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK5; 123831) both in vitro and in
intact mouse neurons. Phosphorylation of Wave1 by Cdk5 inhibited its
ability to regulate Arp2/3 complex (604221)-dependent actin
polymerization. Loss of Wave1 function in vivo or in cultured neurons
resulted in a decrease in mature dendritic spines. Expression of a
dephosphorylation-mimic mutant of Wave1 reversed this loss of Wave1
function in spine morphology, but expression of a phosphorylation-mimic
mutant did not. Cyclic AMP signaling reduced phosphorylation of the Cdk5
sites in Wave1 and increased spine density in a Wave1-dependent manner.
Kim et al. (2006) concluded that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of
WAVE1 in neurons has an important role in the formation of the
filamentous actin cytoskeleton, and thus in the regulation of dendritic
spine morphology.

In addition to its role in hematopoietic maintenance, growth, and
differentiation, the tyrosine kinase Kit (164920) regulates cell shape,
motility, and adhesion via cytoskeletal changes. Mani et al. (2009)
found that Kit ligand (KITLG; 184745)-induced stimulation of Kit
resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of Wasp, Wip (WIPF1; 602357), and
Arp2/3. Kit ligand-induced filopodia were significantly reduced in size
and number, and Kit ligand-induced calcium influx was impaired in Wasp
-/- bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). Kit ligand induced outgrowth
of Wasp-positive cells from a mixture of Wasp -/-, Wasp +/-, and
wildtype cells, suggesting a selective advantage for Wasp-expressing
cells. Comparison of the genetic profile of Wasp -/- and wildtype BMMCs
revealed that, of the approximately 1,500 genes that were up- or
downregulated in response to Kit stimulation, about one-third were Wasp
dependent. Mani et al. (2009) concluded that WASP is required for
KIT-mediated signaling, cytoskeletal changes, and gene expression.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the WASF1 gene
to chromosome 6. Suetsugu et al. (1999) mapped the WASF1 gene to
6q21-q22 using FISH.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Chen et al. (2010) reported the 2.3-angstrom resolution crystal
structure of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) and complementary
mechanistic analyses. The structure showed that the activity-bearing VCA
motif of WAVE is sequestered by a combination of intramolecular and
intermolecular contacts within the WRC. Rac (602048) and kinases appear
to destabilize a WRC element that is necessary for VCA sequestration,
suggesting the way in which these signals stimulate WRC activity towards
the Arp2/3 complex. Chen et al. (2010) concluded that the spatial
proximity of the Rac binding site and the large basic surface of the WRC
suggests how the GTPase and phospholipids could cooperatively recruit
the complex to membranes.

300771	TITLE *300771 TRANSCRIPTION ELONGATION FACTOR A-LIKE 7; TCEAL7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database analysis of a sequence previously identified as a
downregulated gene in 3 of 4 suppression subtraction libraries of
primary ovarian tumors against normal ovarian epithelial cell brushings,
followed by PCR, Chien et al. (2005) cloned TCEAL7. The deduced
100-amino acid protein has a coiled-coil domain. TCEAL7 shares amino
acid similarity with TCEAL1 (300237), TCEAL6, and NGFRAP1 (300361).

GENE FUNCTION

Chien et al. (2005) showed that overexpression of TCEAL7 in ovarian
cancer cells induced apoptosis. RT-PCR analysis detected expression in
normal ovarian epithelial cells but demonstrated loss of expression in
ovarian cancer cell lines and primary tumors, confirming downregulation
in ovarian tumors. Studies with 5-aza-2-prime-deoxycytidine demonstrated
a dose-dependent increase in TCEAL7 expression. The authors concluded
that methylation of a CpG SmaI site plays a role in controlling TCEAL7
expression and activation in primary ovarian tumors. Chien et al. (2005)
stated that there was no evidence for loss of heterozygosity, consistent
with the hypothesis that the TCEAL7 locus displays X inactivation and
that tumor-related epigenetic silencing inactivated the active allele.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chien et al. (2005) determined that the TCEAL7 gene contains 3 exons
with the entire open reading frame contained in exon 3.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Chien et al. (2005) mapped the TCEAL7 gene to
chromosome Xq22.1-q22.3, where it lies 24 kb and 42 kb proximal to
TCEAL6 and NGFRAP1, respectively.

613537	TITLE *613537 NLR FAMILY, CASPASE RECRUITMENT DOMAIN-CONTAINING 5; NLRC5
;;NLR FAMILY, CARD-CONTAINING 5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By PCR and RACE of a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell cDNA
library, Cui et al. (2010) cloned NLRC5. The deduced 1,866-amino acid
protein contains an N-terminal CARD domain, followed by a NOD domain and
a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region made up of 3 LRRs
separated by linker sequences. Human and mouse Nlrc5 share 64% amino
acid identity. Real-time PCR analysis detected highest NLRC5 expression
in both human and mouse spleen, thymus, and lung, and much lower
expression in other tissues. Western blot analysis detected NLRC5
expression in HEK293T cells and in human and mouse macrophage cell
lines. Fluorescence-tagged NLRC5 localized to the cytoplasm of
transfected 293T cells.

Using a GFP-NLRC5 fusion protein, Meissner et al. (2010) found that,
similar to CIITA (MHC2TA; 600005), NLRC5 shuttled between the cytosol
and nucleus in transfected HEK293 cells. They identified a bipartite
nuclear localization signal at the transition between the N-terminal
CARD and central nucleotide-binding domain of NLRC5 that was required
for nuclear localization.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the NLRC5 gene to chromosome 16q13 based on an
alignment of the NLRC5 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF389420) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Using real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, Cui et al. (2010) showed
that Nlrc5 mRNA and protein were highly induced by lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) treatment in a mouse macrophage cell line. Transfection of NLRC5
with an NF-kappa-B (see 164011) reporter plasmid showed that NLRC5 was a
potent inhibitor of NF-kappa-B activation. NLRC5 competed with NEMO
(IKBKG; 300248) for binding to IKK-alpha (CHUK; 600664) and IKK-beta
(IKBKB; 603258) and blocked their phosphorylation and kinase activities.
NLRC5 also interacted with RIGI (DDX58; 609631) and MDA5 (IFIH1;
606951), but not with MAVS (609676), and inhibited RIGI- and
MDA5-mediated type I interferon (see 147660) responses. Knockdown of
NLRC5 in human and mouse cells increased innate cytokine responses and
antiviral immunity against challenge with vesicular stomatitis virus.
Knockout of Myd88 (602170) in mouse macrophages abolished upregulation
of Nlrc5 in response to LPS stimulation, suggesting that expression of
Nlrc5 itself is controlled by NF-kappa-B signaling. Cui et al. (2010)
concluded that NLRC5 is a negative regulator of NF-kappa-B and type I
interferon signaling pathways and has an important role in the control
of innate immunity.

Using gene chip, RT-PCR, Western blot, and flow cytometric analyses,
Meissner et al. (2010) demonstrated that NLRC5 induced expression of MHC
class I and functionally related genes, analogous to the role of IFNG
(147570). Luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed
that NLRC5 associated with MHC class I gene promoters specifically and
transactivated their expression. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed
that, like STAT1 (600555), NLRC5 was induced early after exposure of
cells to IFNG, whereas MHC class I was induced later. Treatment with
NLRC5-specific small interfering RNA reduced IFNG-induced expression of
MHC class I, but not class II. Meissner et al. (2010) concluded that
NLRC5 acts as a transactivator of MHC class I and related genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using Nlrc5-deficient mice, Biswas et al. (2012) showed that Nlrc5 was
required for both constitutive and inducible MHC class I gene
expression. Expression of class I-related genes, such as B2m (109700),
Tap1 (170260), and Lmp2 (PSMB9; 177045), was also severely reduced in
Nlrc5-deficient mice, but the levels of class II MHC were not affected.
Expression of MHC class I remained impaired after stimulation with Ifng
in Nlrc5-deficient cells. Mice lacking Nlrc5 and infected with Listeria
monocytogenes displayed impaired Cd8 (see 186910)-positive T-cell
activation and increased bacterial loads. Biswas et al. (2012) concluded
that NLRC5 has a critical role in MHC class I regulation and host
defense by CD8-positive T-cell responses.

;;APOLIPOPROTEIN B mRNA-EDITING ENZYME, CATALYTIC POLYPEPTIDE 1-BINDING
PROTEIN 1;;
APOBEC1-BINDING PROTEIN 1; ABBP1;;
HNRPAB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Apolipoprotein B (APOB; 107730) mRNA editing is an intranuclear function
and is mediated by a multiprotein editosome complex (see APOBEC1;
600130). Using the yeast 2-hybrid system, Lau et al. (1997) identified
an APOBEC1-binding protein (ABBP1) that interacts with APOB mRNA. The
ABBP1 cDNA encodes a 331-amino acid protein that is identical to the
human type A/B heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) reported
by Khan et al. (1991), except for a 47-residue insertion in its
C-terminal region. Khan et al. (1991) identified the type A/B hnRNP as
an RNA-binding protein of unknown function in HeLa cells. Northern blot
analysis indicated that ABBP1 mRNA is distributed in multiple human
tissues as an approximately 2-kb transcript. The 47-amino acid insertion
of ABBP1 is encoded by an alternatively spliced exon.

GENE FUNCTION

Lau et al. (1997) found that ABBP1 contains typical RNP-type RNA-binding
motifs in its N-terminal half and glycine-rich motifs, which house the
APOBEC1-binding region, in its C-terminal region. ABBP1 binds to APOB
mRNA transcripts around the editing site and can be UV-crosslinked to
them. Editing is inhibited by ABBP1 immunodepletion or antisense ABBP1
cDNA transfection.

186990	TITLE *186990 T-LYMPHOCYTE SURFACE CD2 ANTIGEN; CD2
;;T11;;
SHEEP ERYTHROCYTE RECEPTOR; SRBC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CD2 is a surface antigen of the human T-lymphocyte lineage that is
expressed on all peripheral blood T cells. It is one of the earliest
T-cell markers, being present on more than 95% of thymocytes; it is also
found on some natural killer cells but not on B lymphocytes. Monoclonal
antibodies directed against CD2 inhibit the formation of rosettes with
sheep erythrocytes, indicating that CD2 is the erythrocyte receptor or
is closely associated with it (summary by Sewell et al., 1986).

CLONING

Sewell et al. (1986) isolated cDNA clones for CD2 by screening an
expression library with antiserum against the purified denatured
antigen. The predicted 327-amino acid sequence of the CD2 antigen was
found to have features of a transmembrane glycoprotein, with distant
similarity to the immunoglobulin supergene family, and an extensive,
proline-rich, basic cytoplasmic domain. Seed and Aruffo (1987) also
cloned a cDNA for CD2. They used a highly efficient technique based on
transient expression in COS cells and adherence of cells expressing
surface antigen to antibody-coated dishes, a process they called
panning.

GENE STRUCTURE

Diamond et al. (1988) concluded from genomic DNA clones that the human
T11 gene is about 12 kb long and has 5 exons. The organization of the
murine and human T11 genes is very similar.

Lang et al. (1988) found that in transgenic mice a 28.5-kb segment of
DNA, consisting of 4.5 kb of 5-prime flanking sequences, 15 kb
containing 5 exons, and 9 kb of 3-prime flanking sequences, can direct
the expression of CD2 only on thymocytes, circulating T cells, and
megakaryocytes. Using a baculoviral expression system to produce
milligram quantities of the hydrophilic extracellular segment of CD2,
Richardson et al. (1988) demonstrated that the domain involved in
cellular adhesion is encoded by a single 321-basepair exon.

MAPPING

Brown et al. (1987) used a cDNA clone as a probe to define the
chromosomal location of CD2. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from
somatic cell hybrids showed a high degree of concordance for human
chromosome 1. In particular, a hybrid that contained the short arm only
of human chromosome 1 was positive. The localization of CD2 to 1p13 was
established by in situ hybridization. By Southern blotting of DNA from a
panel of somatic cell hybrids, Clayton et al. (1988) assigned the CD2
gene to human chromosome 1 and murine chromosome 3. Based on the
homology between murine chromosome 3 and human chromosome 1, they
hypothesized that the human CD2 homolog lies on the short arm of
chromosome 1, proximal to p22.1. By fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Mitchell et al. (1995) mapped CD2 to 1p13.1.

Kingsmore et al. (1989) demonstrated physical linkage of CD2 and its
ligand, LFA3 (153420).

GENE FUNCTION

Locus control regions (LCRs) direct high-level and tissue-specific
expression of linked genes in transgenic mice. Festenstein et al. (1996)
stated that this expression is independent of site of integration in the
host genome. With the use of transgenic mice, such an LCR was identified
within the 3-prime flanking region of the human CD2 gene. Festenstein et
al. (1996) found that transgenic mice carrying a human CD2 minigene
attached only to the 3-prime CD2 transcriptional enhancer exhibited
variegated expression when the transgene integrated in the centromere.
The phenotype was similar to position effect variegation (VEV) as
described in Drosophila and Saccharomyces, in which the cell-to-cell
variation of gene expression within a cell lineage is correlated with
the translocation of a normally euchromatic gene to centromeric
heterochromatin. In contrast, the authors found that mice carrying a
transgene with additional 3-prime sequence showed no variegation even
when the transgene integrated in centromeric positions. Their result
suggested that LCRs operate by ensuring an open chromatin configuration
and that a short region, with no enhancer activity, functions in the
establishment, maintenance, or both of an open chromatin domain.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Interaction between CD2 and its counterreceptor, LFA3 (CD58), on
opposing cells optimizes immune recognition, facilitating contacts
between helper T lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells as well as
between cytolytic effectors and target cells. Wang et al. (1999)
reported the crystal structure of the heterophilic adhesion complex
between the N-terminal domains of human CD2 and CD58 at more than
3.2-angstrom resolution. A strikingly asymmetric, orthogonal,
face-to-face interaction involving the major beta sheets of the
respective immunoglobulin-like domains with poor shape complementarity
was revealed. These features explained CD2-CD58 dynamic binding,
offering insights into the interactions of related immunoglobulin
superfamily receptors.

606538	TITLE *606538 MYOSIN IC; MYO1C
;;MYOSIN 2, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; MYR2;;
NUCLEAR MYOSIN I; NMI
DESCRIPTION Myosins are molecular motors that, upon interaction with actin
filaments, utilize energy from ATP hydrolysis to generate mechanical
force. For further background information on myosins, see MYO1A
(601478).

CLONING

By screening a kidney cDNA library with a mouse Myo1c probe, Crozet et
al. (1997) obtained a human cDNA encoding MYO1C. The deduced 1,028-amino
acid protein, which is 96% identical to the mouse protein, contains ATP-
and actin-binding sequences in the motor (or head) domain, followed by
three 23-residue IQ motifs and a tail domain rich in basic residues that
is expected to interact with negatively charged membrane phospholipids.
Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of Myo1c in adult
mouse tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

MYO1C, also known as myosin I-beta and MYR2, was thought to mediate the
slow component of adaptation by hair cells, the sensory cells of the
inner ear. To test this hypothesis, Holt et al. (2002) mutated tyr61 of
MYO1C to gly, conferring susceptibility to inhibition by N6-modified ADP
analogs. They expressed the mutant MYO1C in utricular hair cells of
transgenic mice, delivered an ADP analog through a whole-cell recording
pipette, and found that the analog rapidly blocked adaptation to
positive and negative deflections in transgenic cells but not in
wildtype cells. The speed and specificity of inhibition suggested that
MYO1C participates in adaptation in hair cells.

Bose et al. (2002) reported that the unconventional myosin MYO1C is
present in GLUT4 (138190)-containing vesicles purified from 3T3-L1
adipocytes. MYO1C is highly expressed in primary and cultured
adipocytes. Insulin (176730) enhances the localization of MYO1C with
GLUT4 in cortical tubulovesicular structures associated with actin
filaments, and this colocalization is insensitive to wortmannin.
Insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 to the adipocyte plasma
membrane is augmented by the expression of wildtype MYO1C and inhibited
by a dominant-negative cargo domain of MYO1C. A decrease in the
expression of endogenous MYO1C mediated by small interfering RNAs
inhibited insulin-stimulated uptake of 2-deoxyglucose. Thus, Bose et al.
(2002) concluded that MYO1C functions in a
phosphatidylinositol-3-hydroxykinase (PI3K; see 601232)-independent
insulin signaling pathway that controls the movement of intracellular
GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane.

MAPPING

Using PCR and radiation hybrid analysis, Crozet et al. (1997) mapped the
MYO1C gene to 17p13.

HISTORY

A report by Nunez et al. (2008) indicating that 3-dimensional
motor-dependent interchromosomal interactions involving MYO1C are
required to achieve enhanced transcription of specific estrogen-receptor
target genes was retracted.

123980	TITLE *123980 CYTOCHROME C1; CYC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cytochrome c1 is one of the subunits of the cytochrome bc1 complex of
the mitochondrial electron-transfer chain. It mediates the transfer of
an electron from Rieske iron-sulfur protein to cytochrome c. Nishikimi
et al. (1987) isolated a cDNA clone for cytochrome c1 from a human liver
cDNA library and determined its nucleotide sequence.

Nishikimi et al. (1988) reported the sequence of a cDNA encoding the
precursor of human cytochrome c1.

MAPPING

Nishikimi et al. (1988) used the cloned cDNA for Southern hybridization
analysis to localize the CYC1 gene to chromosome 8 using a panel of
human-mouse somatic cell hybrids.

Fukuyama et al. (1991) regionalized the assignment to 8q24 by
fluorescence in situ suppression hybridization (FISH). By isotopic in
situ hybridization, Duncan et al. (1994) assigned the CYC1 gene to
8q24.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 unrelated patients with mitochondrial complex III deficiency
nuclear type 6 (MC3DN6; 615453), Gaignard et al. (2013) identified 2
different homozygous missense mutations in the CYC1 gene (123980.0001
and 123980.0002). One of the mutations was found by whole-exome
sequencing and the other by candidate gene sequencing. The patients had
a similar phenotype, characterized by recurrent episodes of severe
lactic acidosis and metabolic decompensation beginning in childhood and
usually in response to infection. Both also had insulin-responsive
hyperglycemia. Psychomotor development was subsequently normal.
Immunoblot analysis of patient fibroblasts and skeletal muscle samples
showed a severe reduction in CYC1 protein levels (less than 10% of
controls), suggesting that the mutant proteins were unstable. There was
also a decrease in assembly-dependent complex III subunits, which
correlated with significantly decreased complex III activity in patient
cells. Expression of a single copy of the orthologous mutations in
Cyc1-null yeast resulted in decreased amounts of mutant protein and
failed to rescue the growth defect, but the growth defect could be
partially rescued in transformants harboring multiple copies of the
mutant genes. Similar effects were observed with patient fibroblasts,
indicating that the mutations cause a deleterious effect on complex III
assembly or stability. Crystal structure analysis indicated that both
mutations occurred in the extramembrane domain, which is thought to play
a role in structural and functional integrity of complex III.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 6
CYC1, TRP96CYS

In a Lebanese boy, born of consanguineous parents, with mitochondrial
complex III deficiency nuclear type 6 (MC3DN6; 615453), Gaignard et al.
(2013) identified a homozygous c.288G-T transversion in the CYC1 gene,
resulting in a trp96-to-cys (W96C) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. The mutation, which was found by whole-exome sequencing and
confirmed by Sanger sequencing, segregated with the disorder in the
family. The mutation was not present in the 1000 Genomes or dbSNP
databases, or in 81 Lebanese controls. The child first presented at age
5 months with severe metabolic ketoacidosis, increased serum lactate,
and hyperammonemia associated with a febrile illness. He had recurrent
similar episodes characterized by metabolic abnormalities and
insulin-responsive hyperglycemia and usually associated with illness.
Biochemical studies of patient fibroblasts, skeletal muscle samples, and
liver biopsy showed isolated decreases in mitochondrial complex III
activity. He had normal psychomotor development at age 34 months.

MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 6
CYC1, LEU215PHE

In an 18-year-old girl, born of consanguineous Sri Lankan parents, with
MC3DN6 (615453), Gaignard et al. (2013) identified a homozygous c.643C-T
transition in the CYC1 gene, resulting in a leu215-to-phe (L215F)
substitution at a highly conserved residue. The mutation was found by
candidate gene sequencing of complex III subunits. It segregated with
the disorder in the family and was not found in the 1000 Genomes or
dbSNP databases, or in 100 control alleles. The child first presented at
age 2.5 years with neurologic deterioration resulting in coma. She had
insulin-responsive hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis with increased serum
lactate, liver failure, and hyperammonemia. She subsequently had
numerous similar episodes, but showed normal psychomotor development at
age 18 years. Biochemical studies showed decreased mitochondrial complex
III activity in patient fibroblasts and skeletal muscle samples.

601565	TITLE *601565 INTERFERON REGULATORY FACTOR 8; IRF8
;;INTERFERON CONSENSUS SEQUENCE-BINDING PROTEIN 1; ICSBP1; ICSBP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IRF8, or ICSBP, is a transcription factor of the interferon (IFN)
regulatory factor (IRF) family. The family also includes IRF1 (147575),
IRF2 (147576), and ISGF3 (see 147574). These proteins are composed of a
conserved DNA-binding domain in the N-terminal region and a divergent
C-terminal region that serves as the regulatory domain. IRF family
proteins bind to the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and regulate
expression of genes stimulated by type I IFNs, namely IFN-alpha (IFNA1;
147660) and IFN-beta (IFNB1; 147640). IRF family proteins also control
expression of IFN-alpha- and IFN-beta-regulated genes that are induced
by viral infection (summary by Holtschke et al., 1996).

CLONING

Weisz et al. (1992) cloned human IRF8, which they called ICSBP1. The
ICSBP1 gene shares high sequence homology with its murine homolog.
ICSBP1 transcript was detected exclusively in cell lines of
hematopoietic origin.

Driggers et al. (1992) noted that, in contrast to IRF1 and IRF2, which
are expressed in most cells, ICSBP is expressed exclusively in cells of
the immune system.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chiquet et al. (2007) mapped the IRF8 gene
to chromosome 16q24.1

GENE FUNCTION

Giraud et al. (2007) found that a variant in the CHRNA1 gene (100690)
that prevented binding of IRF8 and abrogated CHRNA1 promoter activity in
thymic epithelial cells in vitro was associated with early onset of
myasthenia gravis (254200) in 2 independent human populations (France
and U.K.). Notably, both the CHRNA1 promoter variant and AIRE (607358)
modulated CHRNA1 mRNA levels in human medullary thymic epithelial cells
ex vivo and also in a transactivation assay. The CHRNA1 gene encodes the
alpha subunit of the muscle acetylcholine receptor, which is the main
target of pathogenic autoantibodies in autoimmune myasthenia gravis.
Giraud et al. (2007) concluded that their findings revealed a critical
function of AIRE and the interferon signaling pathway in regulating
quantitative expression of this autoantigen in the thymus, suggesting
that together they set the threshold for self-tolerance versus
autoimmunity.

Zhao et al. (2009) demonstrated that Irf8 expression in mouse osteoclast
precursors was downregulated during the initial phase of osteoclast
differentiation induced by Rankl (TNFSF11; 602642). Irf8 -/- mice showed
severe osteoporosis due to increased numbers of osteoclasts, and also
showed enhanced bone destruction after lipopolysaccharide
administration. Irf8 -/- mouse osteoclast precursors underwent increased
osteoclastogenesis in response to Rankl and Tnf-alpha (TNF; 191160).
Irf8 suppressed osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting the function and
expression of Nfatc1 (600489). Zhao et al. (2009) concluded that IRF8
inhibits osteoclast formation under physiologic and pathologic
conditions, and suggested that downregulation of inhibitory factors such
as IRF8 contributes to RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Recessive Monocyte and Dendritic Cell Deficiency

In an Irish infant with autosomal recessive monocyte and dendritic cell
deficiency, myeloproliferation, and susceptibility to severe
opportunistic infections (614894), Hambleton et al. (2011) identified a
homozygous lys108-to-glu (K108E; 601565.0001) mutation in the
DNA-binding domain of IRF8. In transfected mouse macrophages, the mutant
protein bound poorly to IL12B (161561) and NOS2 (163730) promoters,
probably due to prevention of hydrogen bond formation. The infant's
healthy parents, who were heterozygous for K108E, and an unaffected sib,
who lacked the K108E allele, had normal peripheral blood mononuclear
cell and dendritic cell numbers. The K108E mutation was not present in
454 unrelated individuals with susceptibility to mycobacterial disease
(see 209950).

- Autosomal Dominant CD11C-Positive/CD1C-Positive Dendritic
Cell Deficiency

In 2 unrelated individuals of Italian descent living in Brazil and Chile
who had histories of multiple episodes of disseminated, but curable, BCG
disease and selective depletion of CD11C (ITGAX; 151510)-positive/CD1C
(188340)-positive circulating dendritic cells (614893), Hambleton et al.
(2011) identified a de novo thr80-to-ala (T80A; 601565.0002) mutation in
the IRF8 gene. The T80A mutation was not detected in 1,064 healthy
controls. The mutant protein showed weak IL12B (161561) promoter
transactivation in transfected mouse macrophages. Hambleton et al.
(2011) proposed that depletion of IL12-producing CD1C-positive dendritic
cells contributes to susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (see
209950).

- Other Associations

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the IRF8
gene and susceptibility to multiple sclerosis, see MS (126200).

ANIMAL MODEL

Holtschke et al. (1996) found that mice in whom a germline mutation of
the ICSBP gene had been produced to result in ICSBP deficiency had
altered antiviral responses associated with impaired production of
IFN-gamma (IFNG; 147570). In the second place, they developed
spontaneous disease with similarities to human chronic myelogenous
leukemia (CML; 608232). Hematopoiesis was deregulated in both homozygous
and heterozygous mice. The chronic period of the disease progressed to a
fatal blast crisis characterized by a clonal expansion of
undifferentiated cells. Normal mice injected with cells from mice in
blast crisis developed acute leukemia within 6 weeks of transfer. These
results suggested a novel role for ICSBP in regulating the proliferation
and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells.

Rosenbauer et al. (2002) identified Dab2 (601236) as a gene
differentially transcribed in myeloid cells developed from Icsbp -/- and
Icsbp +/+ mice. Dab2 transcription and protein expression were repressed
in Icsbp +/+ cells in response to IFN-gamma, and DNA affinity binding
revealed Icsbp recruitment to the Dab2 promoter after IFN-gamma
induction. The PU.1 transcription factor (SPI1; 165170) also bound to
the Dab2 promoter in vitro, and Icsbp repressed PU.1-induced Dab2
promoter transactivation.

Ko et al. (2002) noted that Irf1 -/- mice are deficient in Inos (NOS2A;
163730), Il12b (161561), Cd8 (186910)-positive T cells, and natural
killer (NK) cells, whereas Irf2 -/- mice are deficient in NK cells and
have dysregulated Il12b induction. Icsbp -/- mice are deficient in
Il12b, Irf2, and reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs). All 3 are
inducible by Ifng and have varying susceptibility to different
intracellular bacterial and protozoan pathogens. Ko et al. (2002)
determined that Irf1 -/- mice are highly susceptible to fatal liver
damage from Brucella abortus, the causative agent of brucellosis, which
manifests as arthritis, endocarditis, and meningitis in humans. In
contrast, Irf2 -/- mice are highly resistant to Brucella, whereas Icsbp
-/- mice maintain a plateau of infection similar to that seen in Il12b
-/- mice. The authors concluded that IL12, reactive nitrogen
intermediates, and ROIs are probably crucial immune components in
resistance to Brucella infection.

Schwieger et al. (2002) introduced the AML1 (RUNX1; 151385)/ETO
(CBFA2T1; 133435) fusion gene into mouse bone marrow cells and
transplanted these cells into wildtype mice. They found that AML1/ETO
directly stimulated granulopoiesis, suppressed erythropoiesis, and
impaired maturation of myeloid, B, and T lymphoid cells in vivo. By
introducing AML1/ETO into bone marrow cells from Icsbp-deficient mice,
Schwieger et al. (2002) showed that AML1/ETO synergized with Icsbp
deficiency to induce myeloblastic transformation in bone marrow.

Marquis et al. (2009) found that BXH2 mice, which have an arg294-to-cys
(R294C) mutation in the Irf8 gene, were extremely susceptible to
low-dose intravenous or aerosol infection with Mycobacterium
tuberculosis compared with resistant C57BL/6 (B6) mice and susceptible
C3H/HeJ (C3H) mice. BXH2 mice experienced higher bacterial burden in
liver, spleen, and lungs and died earlier than B6 and C3H mice. RT-PCR
analysis of lungs 6 weeks after infection showed absent Il12b
expression, but comparable levels of Ifng, Nos2, and Tnf, in BXH2 mice
compared with B6 and C3H mice. Compared with B6 mice, multiplex ELISA
showed undetectable or reduced serum Ifng and Il12p70 (IL12A; 161560) in
C3H and BXH2 mice, whereas Tnf levels were comparable, and Mcp1 (CCL2;
158105) was increased in BXH2 mice. Histopathologic analysis showed
marked differences in infected BXH2 organs compared with B6 tissues and
a failure of macrophages to contain M. tuberculosis replication. Marquis
et al. (2009) concluded that IRF8 is a critical regulator of the host
response to the tuberculous bacillus and proposed screening for
polymorphisms in humans.

Milanovic et al. (2008) found that mice lacking Irf8 had reduced numbers
of eosinophils in peripheral blood and bone marrow during normal
conditions and after infection with the nematode parasite
Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, in spite of a vigorous Il5 (147850)
response. Progenitor cells had reduced eosinophil differentiation
potential, and Gata1 (305371) expression was reduced in both eosinophil
progenitors and mature eosinophils. Milanovic et al. (2008) concluded
that IRF8 is a transcription factor critical for eosinophil development.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MONOCYTE AND DENDRITIC CELL DEFICIENCY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
IRF8, LYS108GLU

Hambleton et al. (2011) identified a homozygous lys108-to-glu (K108E)
mutation in the DNA-binding domain of IRF8 in an Irish infant with
severe immunodeficiency and disseminated BCG disease (614894). The
mutation resulted in poor expression of IL12B (161561) and a lack of
circulating monocytes and dendritic cells. The patient required
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and was alive and well with
minimal medication at age 21 months. The infant's parents, who were
nonconsanguineous and heterozygous for K108E, as well as an unaffected
sib who lacked the K108E allele, had normal peripheral blood mononuclear
cell and dendritic cell numbers.

CD11C-POSITIVE/CD1C-POSITIVE DENDRITIC CELL DEFICIENCY, AUTOSOMAL
DOMINANT
IRF8, THR80ALA

In a 39-year-old Chilean man and a 14-year-old Brazilian girl with an
autosomal dominant selective dendritic cell deficiency and
susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (614893), Hambleton et al.
(2011) identified heterozygosity for a de novo thr80-to-ala (T80A)
mutation in the DNA-binding domain of IRF8. Both affected individuals
had experienced multiple episodes of treatable disseminated BCG disease.
They were unrelated, but both were of Italian descent. Both were born to
nonconsanguineous parents. The T80A mutation resulted in poor expression
of IL12B (161561) and a loss of the circulating CD1C (188340)-positive
subgroup of CD11C (ITGAX; 151510)-positive myeloid dendritic cells.

608698	TITLE *608698 DISCOIDIN, CUB, AND LCCL DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; DCBLD2
;;ENDOTHELIAL AND SMOOTH MUSCLE CELL-DERIVED NEUROPILIN-LIKE PROTEIN;
ESDN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the yeast signal sequence trap method to isolate regulatory genes
from human vascular cells, followed by RACE-PCR and genomic library
screening, Kobuke et al. (2001) cloned full-length DCBLD2, which they
called ESDN. The putative 775-amino acid ESDN protein contains a long
signal sequence, a CUB domain, an LCCL module, a coagulation factor V
(612309)/factor VIII (300841) homology domain, and a single
transmembrane domain. Kobuke et al. (2001) obtained mouse and rat Esdn,
which share 84% amino acid identity with human ESDN, and Southern blot
analysis revealed evolutionary conservation of ESDN in mammals and in
Xenopus. Western blot analysis identified 3 ESDN protein bands of
molecular masses 127, 106, and 93 kD, suggesting that ESDN is
N-glycosylated, since all are larger than the calculated molecular mass
of 89 kD. Northern blot analysis detected major and minor ESDN
transcripts of 6.4 and 3 kb, respectively, with high expression in
smooth muscle cells and lower expression in endothelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using quantitative PCR, Kobuke et al. (2001) showed that ESDN transcript
was upregulated by PDGF-BB (190040) in a dose-dependent manner in
primary cultures of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells. In vivo,
rat carotid arteries showed upregulation of Esdn transcript and protein
in response to balloon-generated injury. Expression of ESDN in 293T
cells caused suppression of cell division, as indicated by reduced
bromodeoxyuridine uptake.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid analysis, Kobuke et al. (2001) mapped the
DCBLD2 gene to chromosome 3p12-q11.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRP63 is 1 of more
than 70 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes that are encoded
by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases using bovine Mrp63 as query, followed by PCR of
human genomic DNA, Kenmochi et al. (2001) cloned MRP63.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang and Gerstein (2003) determined that the MRP63 gene has no introns
in its coding region.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS
map, Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRP63 gene to chromosome
13p11.1-q11. By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang and Gerstein (2003)
mapped the MRP63 gene to chromosome 13q12.11. They identified 10 MRP63
pseudogenes scattered throughout the genome.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids, or gangliosides, have various
important biologic functions. In vertebrates, almost all the
ganglio-series gangliosides are synthesized from a common precursor,
ganglioside GM3, which has the simplest structure among the major
gangliosides. GM3, a plasma membrane glycosphingolipid, participates in
induction of differentiation, modulation of proliferation, maintenance
of fibroblast morphology, signal transduction, and integrin-mediated
cell adhesion. ST3GAL5 (EC 2.4.99.9) is responsible for the synthesis of
GM3 (Ishii et al., 1998).

CLONING

Using a cDNA library prepared from a monocyte-differentiated human
myelogenous leukemia cell line, Ishii et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA
encoding SIAT9, which they called GM3 synthase, by a modified expression
cloning strategy. The predicted 362-amino acid SIAT9 protein has
features characteristic of the sialyltransferase family, including a
type II transmembrane topology and the sialyl motifs L in the center and
S in the C-terminal region. However, SIAT9 contains the nonconservative
substitution of asp to his at a position in sialyl motif L that is
invariant in all other known sialyltransferases. Hydropathy plot
analysis suggested that SIAT9 may by anchored to the luminal side of the
Golgi membrane. SIAT9 shares approximately 27 to 41% amino acid sequence
similarity with other known sialyltransferases that catalyze formation
of the alpha-2,3 and alpha-2,6 linkages of sialic acid to the acceptor
galactose moiety, but not with enzymes that catalyze formation of the
alpha-2,8 linkage to the nonreducing terminal sialic acid residue of
glycosphingolipids and glycoproteins. Northern blot analysis detected a
major 2.4-kb SIAT9 transcript in all tissues tested, with highest
expression in brain, skeletal muscle, placenta, and testis. SIAT9 was
widely distributed in human brain, with slightly elevated expression in
the cerebral cortex, temporal lobe, and putamen.

By screening a fetal brain cDNA library, followed by 5-prime RACE, Kim
et al. (2001) identified 4 ST3GAL5 variants that differed only in the
5-prime UTR. The variants resulted from a combination of alternative
splicing and alternative promoter utilization. Northern blot analysis of
adult and fetal tissue detected a 2.4-kb transcript expressed at highest
levels in fetal brain and lung and in adult brain, placenta, and
skeletal muscle. Lower expression was detected in fetal kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Ishii et al. (1998) determined that the substrate specificity of SIAT9
was highly restricted to lactosylceramide as the acceptor.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kim et al. (2001) determined that the ST3GAL5 gene contains 9 exons and
spans about 44 kb. The coding region is located in exons 4 to 9. Kim et
al. (2002) determined that the 5-prime flanking region of the ST3GAL5
gene lacks canonical TATA and CAAT boxes, but contains several putative
transcription factor-binding sites, with both positive and negative
regulatory elements.

By genomic sequence analysis, Zeng et al. (2003) determined that the
SIAT9 gene contains 7 exons and spans more than 62 kb. They noted that
the SIAT9 introns were larger in their analysis than those reported by
Kim et al. (2001). Zeng et al. (2003) identified 2 transcription start
sites upstream of exon 1. A 5-prime proximal fragment bound several
transcription factors in a DNA-binding assay.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kim et al. (2001) mapped the SIAT9 gene to
chromosome 2. Zeng et al. (2003) mapped the SAIT9 gene to chromosome
2p24.3-p24.1 by genomic sequence analysis.

Simpson et al. (2004) mapped an infantile-onset symptomatic epilepsy
syndrome (609056) to 2p12-p11.2 by identification of a region of
homozygosity and found a nonsense mutation in the SIAT9 gene, which was
located in that region. Thus, the location of the gene appeared to be
more proximal than had been thought.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large Old Order Amish pedigree in Geauga County, Ohio, Simpson et
al. (2004) identified an autosomal recessive infantile-onset epilepsy
syndrome associated with developmental stagnation and blindness
(609056). They sequenced genes in a region of homozygosity on 2p12-p11.2
and identified a nonsense mutation in SIAT9 (604402.0001) that was
predicted to result in a premature termination of the GM3 synthase
enzyme (also called lactosylceramide alpha-2,3 sialyltransferase). GM3
synthase catalyzes the initial step in the biosynthesis of most complex
gangliosides from lactosylceramide. Biochemical analysis of plasma
glycosphingolipids confirmed that affected individuals lacked GM3
synthase activity, as marked by a complete lack of GM3 ganglioside and
its biosynthetic derivatives and an increase in lactosylceramide and its
alternative derivatives. Although the relationship between defects in
ganglioside catabolism and a range of lysosomal storage diseases is well
documented, this was, it seems, the first report of a disruption of
ganglioside biosynthesis associated with human disease.

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous French parents, with refractory
epilepsy and delayed psychomotor development, Fragaki et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous truncating mutation in the SIAT9 gene
(604402.0001), which was the same mutation identified by Simpson et al.
(2004) in Amish patients with a similar disorder. The mutation, which
was identified by exome sequencing, segregated with the disorder in the
family. Mass spectrometry analysis of patient fibroblasts showed
complete absence of GM3 ganglioside and its biosynthetic derivatives and
an upregulation of the alternative globoside pathway. Fibroblasts also
showed a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, consistent with
secondary dysfunction of the respiratory chain, as well as increased
apoptosis. Fragaki et al. (2013) suggested that the accumulation of
globosides may have had a role in the respiratory chain dysfunction.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gangliosides are present on all mammalian plasma membranes, where they
participate in recognition and signaling activities. Yamashita et al.
(2003) generated mice lacking GM3 synthase which were unable to
synthesize GM3 ganglioside. The mutant mice were viable and appeared to
be without major abnormalities, but showed a heightened sensitivity to
insulin, the basis of which was found to be enhanced insulin receptor
phosphorylation in skeletal muscle. Importantly, the mutant mice were
protected from high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance. The results
showed that GM3 ganglioside is a negative regulator of insulin
signaling, making it a potential therapeutic target in type II diabetes
(125853).

Yoshikawa et al. (2009) found that Sati -/- mice exhibited no startle
reflex in response to various acoustic stimulations, yet they
demonstrated normal startle responses to air puffs. Electrophysiologic
and histologic analyses of Sati -/- mice revealed that the organ of
Corti in the inner ear was selectively degenerated and the spiral
ganglion was scattered, but all other regions of the cochlea appeared
normal. Scanning electron microscopy showed a significant deficit in
hair bundles of outer hair cells, but not inner hair cells, in the organ
of Corti of Sati -/- mice. Examination of brainstem auditory-evoked
potentials revealed attenuated auditory responses in Sati -/- mice at
postnatal day 14 (P14), when auditory responses were first observed in
wildtype mice. No auditory responses were detected in Sati -/- mice by
P17. Thin-layer chromatography revealed dramatic changes in several
gangliosides during development in wildtype cochlea. At P13, GM3 was
expressed in all regions of the cochlea, but at P14 and in adult mice,
GM3 expression was limited to stria vascularis, spiral ganglion, and the
organ of Corti. No GM3 was detected in the cochlea of Sati -/- mice.
Yoshikawa et al. (2009) concluded that SATI-mediated synthesis of GM3 in
the cochlea is essential for acquisition and maintenance of hearing.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AMISH INFANTILE EPILEPSY SYNDROME
ST3GAL5, ARG288TER

In affected individuals with an autosomal recessive Amish infantile
epilepsy syndrome (609056), Simpson et al. (2004) demonstrated
homozygosity for a nonsense mutation in the SIAT9 gene, arg232 to ter
(ARG232TER; R232X), arising from a c.694C-T transition in exon 8 of the
SIAT9 gene. Heterozygosity was found in several carriers. The mutation
was predicted to cause a loss of function of GM3 synthase. Affected
children completely lacked GM3 and its downstream biosynthetic
derivatives but had increased levels of the immediate precursor to GM3,
lactosylceramide, and evidence of increased flux through the globoside
and paragloboside pathways.

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous French parents, with refractory
epilepsy and delayed psychomotor development, Fragaki et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous c.862C-T transition in exon 6 of the ST3GAL5
gene, resulting in an arg288-to-ter (R288X) substitution. The mutation
was the same as that identified by Simpson et al. (2004) in Amish
patients with a similar disorder; the numbering by Fragaki et al. (2013)
was based on a later reference sequence. The mutation was identified by
exome sequencing and segregated with the disorder in the family. Mass
spectrometry analysis of patient fibroblasts showed complete absence of
GM3 ganglioside and its biosynthetic derivatives and an upregulation of
the alternative globoside pathway. Fibroblasts also showed a decrease in
mitochondrial membrane potential, consistent with secondary dysfunction
of the respiratory chain, as well as increased apoptosis. Fragaki et al.
(2013) suggested that the accumulation of globosides may have had a role
in the respiratory chain dysfunction.

;;HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN METHYLTRANSFERASE 1-LIKE 1;
HRMT1L1;;
HMT1-LIKE 1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Katsanis et al. (1997) isolated HRMT1L1, a novel transcript from
chromosome 21 similar to the rat protein arginine N-methyltransferase-1
gene (PRMT1; 602950) reported by Lin et al. (1996). Katsanis et al.
(1997) found that HRMT1L1 was expressed in all tissues they
investigated.

Scott et al. (1998) further characterized HRMT1L1 and HRMT1L2. By
Northern blot analysis, they found that HRMT1L1 is expressed as a 2.4-kb
transcript in various adult and fetal tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Katsanis et al. (1997) noted that the function of protein
methyltransferases is posttranslational methylation of arginine
residues. Two types of activity had been described, attributed to
different classes of enzymes. One methylates myelin protein zero (MPZ;
159440); the other was originally thought to methylate histones, but was
later found to methylate hnRNPs far more efficiently. The authors
suggested that HRMT1L1, a human homolog of yeast RMT1, associates with
hnRNPs.

Scott et al. (1998) found that HRMT1L1 could not methylate HNRNPA1
(164017) or any other tested substrate in vitro, and did not complement
a yeast arginine methyltransferase mutant strain.

MAPPING

Katsanis et al. (1997) mapped the PRMT2 gene to chromosome 21 by study
of monochromosomal cell hybrids and fine mapped the gene by PCR analysis
of a partial chromosome 21 hybrid panel to a telomeric position on
21q22.3. Hybridization to a YAC that was positive for S100B (176990)
indicated that PRMT2 is no more than 10 kb from S100B. S100B was the
most telomeric chromosome 21 gene known at that time.

601468	TITLE *601468 METHIONINE ADENOSYLTRANSFERASE II, ALPHA; MAT2A
;;MATA2;;
MAT II, KIDNEY-SPECIFIC;;
S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE SYNTHETASE 2; SAMS2
DESCRIPTION Methionine adenosyltransferase (EC 2.5.1.6) catalyzes the biosynthesis
of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) from methionine and ATP. AdoMet is the
major methyl donor for many of the transmethylation reactions in the
body. Chamberlin et al. (1996) noted that AdoMet also participates in
the transsulfuration pathway and, after decarboxylation, serves as a
propylamine group donor in the biosynthesis of polyamines. Three forms
of MAT have been identified in mammalian tissues. MAT I and MAT III,
which are encoded by the single-copy MAT1A gene (610550), represent
tetramers and dimers, respectively, formed from identical alpha-1
subunits and are synthesized primarily in the liver. MAT II, encoded by
a separate gene, which was cloned by Horikawa and Tsukada (1992), is
found in fetal liver (and to a lesser extent in adult liver) as well as
in kidney, brain, testis, and lymphocytes. Horikawa and Tsukada (1992)
showed that the 395-amino acid MAT II shares 84% amino acid similarity
with the human liver MAT I/III protein.

Mao et al. (1998) cloned the 5-prime flanking region of the MAT2A gene.
They identified 2 major transcriptional start sites, one located within
10 nucleotides downstream and the other 158 nucleotides upstream from
the TATA box. The MAT2A promoter is highly GC rich, especially in the
first 300 bp. The promoter contains several potential SP1-, v-myb-, and
GATA-binding sites, as well as potential binding sites for C/EBP, HSF2,
c-myb, and STATx. Mao et al. (1998) showed that the MAT2A promoter can
efficiently drive expression from a reporter gene in both Jurkat and 293
cells. The authors identified regions of the promoter that are important
for cell-specific MAT2A expression.

By in situ hybridization, De La Rosa et al. (1995) mapped the MATA2 gene
to 2p11.2.

138300	TITLE +138300 GLUTATHIONE REDUCTASE; GSR
GLUTATHIONE REDUCTASE, HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA DUE TO DEFICIENCY OF, IN RED
CELLS, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION Long (1967) found in a black American a variant red cell GSR (EC
1.6.4.2) characterized by greater electrophoretic mobility and enzyme
activity per unit of hemoglobin than the normal. Inheritance was
autosomal codominant. Three homozygotes were identified. The relation to
gout, suggested by Long (1967), is problematical. Long (1972) observed 2
variant forms of red cell GSR which appear to bind far more avidly than
the common form of the enzyme. In cases of mosaic trisomy for chromosome
8, de la Chapelle et al. (1976) found elevated glutathione reductase
activity, with other enzymes normal. George and Francke (1976) assigned
the gene to the region 8p21-p23 by the gene dosage method. In an infant
with terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome 8, de la Chapelle
et al. (1976) found low GSR activity. They concluded that the GSR locus
is in the region 8pter-p21. Sinet et al. (1977) narrowed the assignment
to 8p21. The GSR locus has also been assigned by somatic cell
hybridization; it is one of the enzyme-markers for each chromosome
(table 1 in Shows and Sakaguchi, 1980), useful for synteny mapping.

Lohr and Waller (1962) observed a 'new' form of enzyme-deficiency
hemolytic anemia in which glutathione reductase was deficient and
glutathione (GSH) was low as a consequence. (This condition is
apparently distinct from that described by Oort et al. (1961) in which
GSH was also low, but glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutathione
reductase were normal.) Lohr (1963) observed 10 homozygotes and 5
heterozygotes in a family distribution consistent with autosomal
recessive inheritance. Blume et al. (1968) studied a kindred with many
persons who were demonstrably heterozygous by chemical test. Hampel et
al. (1969) found a markedly increased frequency of chromosomal
aberrations in a patient with pancytopenia and absent GSR-II band in the
electropherogram. The mother was hematologically normal but had absent
GSR-II band and a moderate increase in the frequency of chromosomal
aberrations. Addition of chloramphenicol to the cultures increased the
number of damaged chromosomes in both the mother and the son. Staal et
al. (1969) described a variety of glutathione reductase anemia in which
the variant enzyme had diminished affinity for flavin adenine
dinucleotide (FAD). The patient's anemia was corrected by vitamin B2.
Administration of flavin compounds to normal individuals or addition to
hemolysates of most normal persons causes an increase in activity of GSR
(Beutler, 1969). In a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus,
Fajnholc et al. (1971) found red cell GSR deficiency which was
correctable in vivo with riboflavin and in vitro with FAD. The same
deficiency was found in the mother and some of her relatives (who were
asymptomatic) but not in the father and his relatives. Enzyme kinetics
were normal. These workers concluded that the defect was not in the
apoenzyme. Loos et al. (1976) found virtually complete absence of GSR
activity in the erythrocytes of 3 children of a consanguineous marriage
and intermediate levels in the parents. Activity was not restored by FAD
in vitro or riboflavin in vivo. Clinically the deficiency was manifested
by favism in 1 child and by cataracts in 2. Reduced GSR was found in
leukocytes, as well as evidence of impaired bactericidal capacity, but
there was no history of repeated infections. Furthermore, Roos et al.
(1979) found that chemotaxis, phagocytosis of opsonized S. aureus, and
degranulation proceeded normally. Intracellular killing appeared normal
at low ratios of bacteria to phagocytes, but higher ratios resulted in
defective bacterial killing. GSR deficiency is a frequent occurrence in
northern Thailand. Flatz (1971) found a high frequency of GSR deficiency
in northern Thailand but concluded that it was probably secondary to
dietary riboflavin deficiency because activity of the enzyme was raised
markedly in most deficient persons by administration of riboflavin.
Studies of the families of 6 persons with poor response to riboflavin
gave no evidence supporting 'simple dominant inheritance,' and the
proband with low GSR values had no hematologic evidence of a hemolytic
tendency. Nevin et al. (1990) found increased GSR activity in a child
with an inverted tandem duplication of 8p23.1-p12.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a combination of behavioral analysis of 6 inbred mouse strains
with quantitative gene expression profiling of several brain regions,
Hovatta et al. (2005) identified 17 genes with expression patterns that
correlated with anxiety-like behavioral phenotypes. To determine if 2 of
the genes, glyoxalase-1 (138750) and glutathione reductase-1, have a
causal role in the genesis of anxiety, Hovatta et al. (2005) performed
genetic manipulation using lentivirus-mediated gene transfer. Local
overexpression of these genes in the mouse brain resulted in increased
anxiety-like behavior, while local inhibition of glyoxalase-1 expression
by RNA interference decreased the anxiety-like behavior. Hovatta et al.
(2005) concluded that both of these genes are involved in oxidative
stress metabolism, linking this pathway with anxiety-related behavior.

606847	TITLE *606847 TCOF1 GENE; TCOF1
;;TREACLE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By positional cloning, the Treacher Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group
(1996) identified a novel gene of unknown function, which they
designated treacle, within the Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS; 154500)
critical region at 5q. Northern blot analysis indicated that the gene is
expressed in a variety of fetal and adult tissues. Dixon et al. (1997)
isolated the coding sequence of the gene, designated TCOF1, and
determined that it encodes a low complexity, serine/alanine-rich protein
of approximately 144 kD. The deduced 1,411-amino acid protein has 3
domains with unique N and C termini and a large central repeat domain.
Wise et al. (1997) showed that the repeat protein motifs are shared with
nucleolar trafficking proteins in other species and are predicted to be
highly phosphorylated by casein kinase II (115440). Consistent with
this, the full-length TCOF1 protein sequence also contains putative
nuclear and nucleolar localization signals.

So et al. (2004) identified 1 major and 2 minor in-frame splice variants
of treacle that differed from the transcript reported by the Treacher
Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group (1996). The major variant includes
an additional 231-nucleotide exon, 6A, which introduces an additional
repeat of alternating basic and acidic regions and a novel functional
monopartite nuclear localization signal (KRAKK). The deduced protein
contains 1,488 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 152
kD. Northern blot analysis of HeLa cells detected this variant at about
5.5 kb. RT-PCR detected 1.5- to 3.7-fold higher expression of variants
containing exon 6A than those lacking this exon in all human tissues and
cell lines examined. The 2 minor variants identified by So et al. (2004)
include one containing a different additional exon (16A) and the other
lacking exon 19.

Dixon et al. (1997) isolated the murine homolog of the TCOF1 gene and
showed that it encodes a protein of 133 kD. Interspecies comparison
indicated that the proteins display 61.5% identity, with the level of
conservation being greatest in the regions of acidic/basic amino acid
repeats and nuclear localization signals. These features are shared with
the nucleolar phosphoproteins. Confirmation that the gene isolated was
orthologous with the Treacher Collins syndrome gene was provided by the
demonstration that it mapped to central mouse chromosome 18 in a region
of conserved synteny with 5q21-q33. The gene was found to be expressed
in a wide variety of embryonic and adult tissues of the mouse. So et al.
(2004) examined mouse Tcof1 transcripts and identified a variant
containing an additional exon (16A).

GENE STRUCTURE

Gladwin et al. (1996) defined the intron-exon structure of the TCOF1
gene, identified 7 exons, and derived intronic sequences. Wise et al.
(1997) reported the complete exon/intron genomic structure of the TCOF1
gene and its complete coding sequence. The TCOF1 gene contains 26 exons.

So et al. (2004) identified 2 additional exons within the TCOF1 gene:
exon 6A and exon 16A. The sequence containing exon 6A transcribes the
major TCOF1 isoform.

MAPPING

The Treacher Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group (1996) found that the
treacle gene (TCOF1), which is mutant in Treacher Collins syndrome, is
located on chromosome 5q in a gene-rich region of the human genome.
DTDST (606718), CSF1R, PDGFRB (173410), and CDX1 (600746) are within
approximately 900 kb proximal of the TCOF1 locus, determined by a
combination of radiation hybrid and YAC/cosmid contig analysis. The same
process demonstrated that DHLAG, RPS14, HSST (600853), GPX3 (138321),
and ANX6 are distal to TCOF1. Moreover, a large number of additional
genes of unknown function had been mapped to the region.

GENE FUNCTION

The Treacher Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group (1996) stated that the
clinical phenotype of Treacher Collins syndrome suggests that the
responsible gene plays a fundamental role in early embryonic
development, particularly in development of the craniofacial complex.
Dixon et al. (1997) observed that peak levels of expression in the
developing mouse embryo were present at the edges of the neural folds
immediately before fusion, and also in the developing branchial arches
at the time of critical morphogenetic events. Dixon et al. (1997)
commented that these observations support a role for the gene in the
development of the craniofacial complex and provide further evidence
that the gene encodes a protein that may be involved in
nucleolar-cytoplasmic transport.

Jones et al. (1999) used treacle fusion peptides to demonstrate that the
region encoded by exon 9 is phosphorylated in vitro by both casein
kinase II and protein kinase C (see 176960). Furthermore, they found
such a kinase activity to be present in protein extracts from several
embryonic avian tissues, including branchial arches I and II.

Using database mining and protein structural prediction programs, Emes
and Ponting (2001) identified a sequence motif in the products of genes
mutated in Miller-Dieker lissencephaly (LIS1; 601545), Treacher Collins,
oral-facial-digital type 1 (CXORF5; 300170), and ocular albinism with
late-onset sensorineural deafness (TBL1X; 300196) syndromes. Over 100
eukaryotic intracellular proteins were found to possess a LIS1 homology
motif, including several katanin p60 (606696) subunits, muskelin
(605623), Nopp140 (602394), the plant proteins tonneau and LEUNIG, slime
mold protein aimless, and numerous WD repeat-containing beta-propeller
proteins. The authors suggested that LIS1 homology motifs may contribute
to the regulation of microtubule dynamics, either by mediating
dimerization, or else by binding cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain (600112)
or microtubules directly. The predicted secondary structure of LIS1
homology motifs, and their occurrence in homologs of G-beta
beta-propeller subunits, suggests that they are analogs of G-gamma
subunits, and might associate with the periphery of beta-propeller
domains. The finding of LIS1 homology motifs in both treacle and Nopp140
reinforces previous observations of functional similarities between
these nucleolar proteins.

Valdez et al. (2004) showed that treacle is involved in ribosomal DNA
gene transcription by interacting with upstream binding factor (UBF;
600673). Immunofluorescence labeling showed that treacle and UBF
colocalize to specific nucleolar organizer regions and cosegregate
within nucleolar caps of actinomycin D-treated HeLa cells; biochemical
analysis showed the association of treacle and UBF with chromatin.
Immunoprecipitation and the yeast 2-hybrid system both suggested
physical interaction of the 2 nucleolar phosphoproteins. Downregulation
of treacle expression using specific short interfering RNA (siRNA)
resulted in inhibition of ribosomal DNA transcription and cell growth. A
similar correlation was observed in Tcof1 +/- mouse embryos that
exhibited craniofacial defects and growth retardation. Valdez et al.
(2004) concluded that treacle haploinsufficiency in patients with
Treacher Collins syndrome may result in abnormal development caused by
inadequate ribosomal RNA production in the prefusion neural folds during
the early stages of embryogenesis.

Gonzales et al. (2005) showed that antisense-mediated downregulation of
Tcof1 expression in Xenopus oocytes reduced 2-prime-O-methylation of
pre-rRNA. Analysis of RNA isolated from wildtype and Tcof1 +/- mice
embryos from strains that exhibit a lethal phenotype showed significant
reduction in 2-prime-O-methylation at nucleotide 463C of 18S rRNA. There
was no significant difference in rRNA methylation between wildtype and
heterozygous embryos of DBAxBALB/c mice, which have no obvious
craniofacial phenotype. The authors proposed that the function of TCOF1
in pre-rRNA methylation is most likely mediated by its direct physical
interaction with NOP56 (614154), a component of the ribonucleoprotein
methylation complex. Although TCOF1 colocalizes with UBF throughout
mitosis, it colocalizes with NOP56 and fibrillarin (FBL; 134795), a
putative methyltransferase, only during telophase when rDNA gene
transcription and pre-rRNA methylation are known to commence. The
authors suggested that TCOF1 might link RNA polymerase I-catalyzed
transcription and posttranscriptional modification of pre-rRNA. Gonzales
et al. (2005) hypothesized that haploinsufficiency of TCOF1 in TCS
patients may result in inhibition of production of properly modified
mature rRNA in addition to inhibition of rDNA gene transcription, which
consequently affects proliferation and proper differentiation of
specific embryonic cells during development.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The Treacher Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group (1996) identified
different mutations in the TCOF1 gene in each of 5 unrelated families
with Treacher Collins syndrome. All of the mutations were predicted to
result in premature termination of the gene product.

Gladwin et al. (1996) used oligonucleotide primers designed from the
intronic sequence to amplify each exon from genomic DNA. They amplified
exons from the DNA of one affected individual from each of 33 Treacher
Collins families and screened for mutations using SSCP. They identified
mobility shifts in 4 exons. The mutations identified by Gladwin et al.
(1996) included 3 deletions (of either 1 or 2 nucleotides), an insertion
of a single nucleotide, and an unusual splicing mutation. They reported
that these 5 mutations are all different from the 5 mutations previously
reported by the Treacher Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group (1996) and
that all 10 of the mutations found in TCOF1 are nonsense or frameshift
mutations that would be predicted to result in premature termination of
the protein product. None of the TCOF1 mutations found in affected
individuals were detected on chromosomes from 200 controls. Gladwin et
al. (1996) noted that all reported mutations were unique to each family.

Dixon (1996) reviewed the clinical and molecular features of Treacher
Collins syndrome. A total of 20 mutations in the TCOF1 gene had been
identified, of which 2 were nonsense mutations, 5 were insertions, 11
were deletions, and 2 were splicing mutations. A 5-bp deletion had been
observed in 4 unrelated families. All of the mutations observed resulted
in introduction of premature termination codons into the reading frame,
suggesting haploinsufficiency as the molecular mechanism underlying the
disorder.

Edwards et al. (1997) reported several previously undescribed mutations
throughout the TCOF1 gene in patients with Treacher Collins syndrome,
bringing the total number of reported mutations to 35, which represented
a detection rate of 60%. All but one of the mutations resulted in the
introduction of a premature termination codon into the predicted
protein. Moreover, the mutations were largely family specific, although
a common 5-bp deletion in exon 24 was seen in 7 different families and a
recurrent splicing mutation in intron 3 in 2 different families. The
mutational spectrum supported the hypothesis that TCS results from
haploinsufficiency. Throughout the open reading frame, Wise et al.
(1997) detected 8 mutations in TCS families and several polymorphisms
(e.g., 154500.0003).

Splendore et al. (2000) screened 28 families with a clinical diagnosis
of Treacher Collins syndrome for mutations in the 25 coding exons of the
TCOF1 gene and their adjacent splice junctions, using SSCP and direct
sequencing. Pathogenic mutations were detected in 26 patients (93%),
bringing the number of known disease-causing mutations from 35 to 51. A
clustering of pathogenic mutations was identified. They confirmed a
previous finding that TCOF1 has an unusually high rate of
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within its coding region.

Splendore et al. (2002) found no mutations in the TCOF1 gene in 3
disorders with features overlapping those of Treacher Collins syndrome:
Goldenhar syndrome (164210), Nager syndrome (154400), and Miller
syndrome (263750).

In 33 of 60 patients (55%) with Treacher Collins syndrome, Splendore et
al. (2002) identified 31 mutations in the TCOF1 gene, 27 of which were
novel. Five exons accounted for over 50% of the mutations, with exons 23
and 24 being the main hotspots. All mutations except 1, a tyr50-to-cys
substitution (Y50C; 606847.0005), resulted in a truncated protein.

In a patient with the clinical diagnosis of Treacher Collins syndrome,
Shoo et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 2-bp deletion in the TCOF1
gene (606847.0006). The mother was clinically unaffected but the same
mutation was found in her leukocytes, hair root bulbs, buccal mucosa,
urine, and stool. Maternal grandparents did not have the mutation.
Because the mother had the mutation in cells derived from all 3 germ
layers, Shoo et al. (2004) at first suspected that the mutation was
nonpenetrant; however, they could not detect the mutation in her skin
fibroblasts, suggesting that she was mosaic.

Shows et al. (2006) reported on an infant rhesus macaque (Macaca
mulatta) that displayed the Treacher Collins syndrome phenotype and was
identified at the California National Primate Research Center. They
cloned the TCOF1 coding region from a normal rhesus macaque and
sequenced it. The rhesus homolog of TCOF1 was found to be 91.6%
identical in cDNA sequence and 93.8% identical in translated protein
sequence to human TCOF1. Sequencing of TCOF1 in the TCS-affected rhesus
macaque showed no mutations within the coding region or splice sites;
however, real-time quantitative PCR showed an 87% reduction of spleen
TCOF1 mRNA in the affected macaque when compared with normal macaque
spleen. The presumed haploinsufficiency of functional protein,
especially at the critical timepoint in development when TCOF1 is
normally expressed in large quantities to promote development of the
craniofacial skeleton, may account for the phenotype; the lower level of
mRNA was not caused by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay because a nonsense
mutation was not found in the coding region. A promoter mutation could
not be excluded.

Bowman et al. (2012) identified pathogenic sequence variants in the
TCOF1 gene in 92 (50.5%) of 182 unrelated patients with a clinical
diagnosis consistent with Treacher Collins syndrome. Of those with a
sequence change, 57% had a frameshift or mutation disrupting the start
codon, 23% had a nonsense mutation, 16% had a splice site mutation, and
4% had a missense mutation. In addition, 5.2% of patients had an
intragenic deletion of the TCOF1 gene. Thus, the majority of TCOF1
mutations lead to a loss of protein function and haploinsufficiency.

ANIMAL MODEL

Haworth et al. (2001) isolated the dog homolog of the TCOF1 gene from a
dog embryonic head/neck cDNA library. The protein shows a similar
3-domain structure to that described for human TCOF1, but the dog gene
lacks exon 10 and contains 2 exons not present in the human sequence. In
addition, exon 19 is differentially spliced in the dog. They mapped the
dog TCOF1 gene to chromosome 4q31, a region showing syntenic homology
with human chromosome 5. Genetic analysis of DNA of dogs from 13
different breeds identified 9 DNA sequence variants, 3 of which gave
rise to amino acid substitutions. Grouping dogs according to head type
showed that a 396C-T variant, leading to a pro117-to-ser amino acid
substitution, is associated with skull/face shape in this dog panel. The
numbers were small, but the association between the T allele and
brachycephaly, broad skull/short face, was highly significant (P =
0.000024). The short period of time during which the domestic dog breeds
have been established suggests that this mutation has arisen only once
in the history of dog domestication.

Dixon et al. (2006) created Tcof1 +/- mouse lines and noted that the
extent and severity of the phenotype was dependent upon the genetic
background. Tcof1 +/- neonates obtained through an intercross of DBA
Tcof1 heterozygotes and wildtype C57BL/6 mice exhibited a phenotype that
mimicked TCS. The heads of Tcof1 +/- neonates were small and dome
shaped, with anteroposterior shortening and severe frontonasal
dysplasia. Tcof1 +/- neonates displayed gasping behavior and abdominal
distention and died within 24 hour of birth. Skeletal analysis indicated
that Tcof1 +/- neonates died from respiratory arrest due to
malformations of the nasal, premaxilla, maxilla, and palatine skeletal
elements. Whole-embryo culture of wildtype and Tcof1 +/- mouse embryos
showed that Tcof1 haploinsufficiency resulted in neural crest cell
hypoplasia due to neuroepithelial-specific apoptosis. Furthermore, Dixon
et al. (2006) found that Tcof1 haploinsufficiency resulted in deficient
production of mature ribosomes, leading to apoptosis and reduced cell
proliferation.

Richter et al. (2010) used Tcof1 mutant mice to dissect the
developmental mechanisms underlying congenital hearing loss. Effective
cavitation of the middle ear was intimately linked to growth of the
auditory bulla, the neural crest cell-derived structure that
encapsulates all middle ear components, and defects in these processes
had a profoundly detrimental effect on hearing.

NOMENCLATURE

The designation 'treacle' may be best used for the protein encoded by
the TCOF1 locus. The word treacle clearly comes from Treacher Collins
and may have been devised by the British members of the collaborative
group where 'treacle' is the equivalent of the American's 'molasses.'

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, GLN252TER

In affected members of a family with Treacher Collins syndrome (154500),
the Treacher Collins Syndrome Collaborative Group (1996) found a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 703 that created a stop codon in place of a
glutamine residue, resulting in premature termination of the protein.
The mutation created a BfaI site allowing the confirmation that this
mutation was present in all of the affected but none of the unaffected
family members.

Edwards et al. (1997) stated that this gln-to-ter mutation occurred at
position 252 (Q252X).

.0002
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, 1-BP INS, 422A

Wise et al. (1997) described a patient with familial Treacher Collins
syndrome (154500) who had an insertion of a single adenine after
nucleotide 422 in exon 5 (422insA). The insertion caused a change from
histidine to glutamine at codon 141 and a change in the subsequent amino
acids, with a stop codon 33 amino acids beyond the site of the
insertion.

.0003
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, 4-BP DEL, NT497

In a patient with Treacher Collins syndrome (154500), Wise et al. (1997)
demonstrated a mutation in the TCOF1 gene that consisted of deletion of
4 bp, ATAC, after nucleotide 497 (497delATAC). The deletion caused a
change in codon 166 from asparagine to isoleucine and a change in the
downstream amino acids until the point of a stop codon 44 amino acids
beyond the deletion.

.0004
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, 5-BP DEL, NT4135

In a review of mutations in the TCOF1 gene causing Treacher Collins
syndrome (154500), Splendore et al. (2000) found that the most frequent
recurring mutation was a 5-bp deletion in exon 24 (4135-4139delGAAAA).
This mutation was reported in 7 families by Edwards et al. (1997), was
found by Splendore et al. (2000) in 6 unrelated patients, and was said
to be responsible for approximately 16% of all reported cases.

.0005
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, TYR50CYS

In a patient with sporadic Treacher Collins syndrome (154500), Splendore
et al. (2002) identified a 149A-G transition in exon 2 of the TCOF1
gene, resulting in a tyr50-to-cys (Y50C) substitution. Analysis of
parental DNA indicated that the mutation arose de novo. The mutation was
not detected in 100 control chromosomes. Splendore et al. (2002) noted
that missense mutations causing Treacher Collins syndrome are rare (most
are truncating mutations), and pointed out that human exons 1 and 2 are
highly conserved, suggesting that the N terminus of the protein is an
important functional domain.

.0006
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, 2-BP DEL, 1408AG

In a patient with the clinical diagnosis of Treacher Collins syndrome
(154500), Shoo et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 2-bp deletion,
1408delAG, in the TCOF1 gene. The mother was clinically unaffected but
the same mutation was found in her leukocytes, hair root bulbs, buccal
mucosa, urine, and stool. Maternal grandparents did not have the
mutation. Because the mother had the mutation in cells derived from all
3 germ layers, Shoo et al. (2004) at first suspected that the mutation
was nonpenetrant; however, they could not detect the mutation in her
skin fibroblasts, suggesting that she was mosaic.

.0007
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, ARG911TER

In a 5-year-old girl with Treacher Collins syndrome (154500) and
craniosynostosis, choanal atresia, and esophageal regurgitation,
Horiuchi et al. (2004) identified a de novo 2731C-T transition in exon
17 of the TCOF1 gene, resulting in an arg911-to-ter (R911X) change that
truncates the protein.

.0008
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, 18-BP DEL, NT376

In a patient with typical Treacher Collins syndrome (154500), Marszalek
et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous 18-bp deletion beginning at
nucleotide 376 within the 5-prime splice site in exon 4 of the TCOF1
gene. The deletion included 3 bp of exon 4 and 15 bp of intron 4 and
resulted in premature termination of the protein. Real-time PCR analysis
showed different melting temperatures of the amplified fragments
containing the normal allele and the mutated allele, which could be used
as a rapid screening assay. Marszalek et al. (2003) stated that the
deletion was the third largest found to date in the TCOF1 gene.

.0009
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME
TCOF1, 1-BP DEL, 4134A

In a patient with Treacher Collins syndrome (154500), Splendore et al.
(2002) identified a 1-bp deletion (4134delA) in exon 24 of the TCOF1
gene.

In a patient with Treacher Collins syndrome who had novel craniofacial
and extracraniofacial features, Li et al. (2009) identified the same
frameshift mutation (4365delA) in the TCOF1 sequence that includes an
additional 231-nucleotide exon (6A). The mutation resulted in a
read-through of the native stop codon of the TCOF1 gene, adding more
than 80 novel amino acids to the 3-prime end of the protein. The authors
noted that the patient also had a 1535T-C transition in TCOF1, resulting
in a met512-to-thr substitution; this substitution was also present in
his unaffected mother. Unusual features in the patient included
encephalocele, marked malformation of the eyes, abnormal inner ear
structures, and several anomalies that involved the thyroid, the thymus,
the heart, an accessory spleen, ectopic adrenal gland tissue, and
underdeveloped external genitalia.

611998	TITLE *611998 cAMP RESPONSIVE ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 3-LIKE 3; CREB3L3
;;CREBH
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CREB3L3 is a liver-specific transcription factor and member of the
CREB/ATF transcription factor family (Omori et al., 2001).

CLONING

By random sequencing of cDNA clones derived from human hepatoma cell
line, followed by additional cDNA library screening and PCR of normal
liver cDNA library, Omori et al. (2001) cloned CREB3L3, which they
called CREBH. The deduced 463-amino acid protein contains a C-terminal
b-ZIP domain, a putative transmembrane domain, a leucine zipper domain,
and a KDEL-like sequence. Northern blot analysis of human tissues
detected a 2.5-kb transcript exclusively in liver. Fluorescence
microscopy localized CREB3L3 to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

GENE FUNCTION

By GAL4-CREB3L3 fusion transfection assay, Omori et al. (2001) showed
that CREB3L3 activated transcription of luciferase and box-B reporters
via its N-terminal 141 amino acids. Gel mobility shift assay
demonstrated that CREB3L3 specifically bound CRE and the box-B element.

Zhang et al. (2006) found that proinflammatory cytokines increased
expression of Crebh mRNA in mouse H2.35 hepatoma cells. ER stress
induced cleavage of the 75-kD full-length human CREBH by site-1 (MBTPS1;
603355) and site-2 (MBTPS2; 300294) proteases to release a 50-kD
N-terminal fragment that translocated to the nucleus to activate
transcription in transfected H2.35 and COS-7 cells. Studies in
Crebh-knockdown mice showed that Crebh was required to induce expression
of the acute phase response (APR) genes Crp (123260) and Sap (APCS;
104770). Proinflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharide activated the
unfolded protein response and induced cleavage of Crebh in mouse liver
in vivo. Reporter assays showed that human CREBH interacted with human
ATF6 (605537) to synergistically activate transcription of the mouse Sap
and human CRP genes. EMSA and DNA-protein binding assays showed that
CREBH and ATF6 bound to a conserved sequence motif in APR genes,
including CRP and SAP. Zhang et al. (2006) concluded that CREBH plays a
critical role in activation of the acute inflammatory response.

GENE STRUCTURE

Omori et al. (2001) determined that the CREB3L3 gene contains 10 exons
spanning 19.4 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Omori et al. (2001) mapped the CREB3L3
gene to chromosome 19p13.3.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Villa et al. (1996) identified 3 genes related to ZNF75 (ZNF75D;
314997), including ZNF75A. The authors noted that the genes of this
family are conserved in the great apes.

MAPPING

Using a human-rodent hybrid panel, Villa et al. (1996) mapped the ZNF75A

164005	TITLE *164005 NUCLEAR FACTOR I/X; NFIX
;;NUCLEAR FACTOR I, X-TYPE;;
CCAAT-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR;;
NF1A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nuclear factor I is a ubiquitous 47-kD dimeric DNA-binding protein whose
recognition sequence, TGG(C/A)N(5)GCCAA, is found in the genomes of a
number of DNA viruses. The same sequence occurs frequently in the human
genome. The NFI protein stimulates initiation of adenovirus DNA
replication in vitro and is capable of stimulating the transcription of
genes in cooperation with other factors, such as the estrogen receptor
(ESR; 133430). Santoro et al. (1988) gave a detailed analysis of NFI
cDNAs isolated from the human, which, with similar analyses in other
species, indicated that it is a member of a family of related proteins.
Four known variants were referred to as CTF, X, L, and Red. These are
the products of different genes, some of which (e.g., the first, CTF,
later symbolized NFIC; 600729) are subject to differential splicing.

Seisenberger et al. (1993) isolated 2 phages containing the second exon
and flanking intron regions of the human gene for NFI/X, which has been
designated NFIX.

Qian et al. (1995) isolated partial cDNA sequences from 4 nuclear factor
I proteins: NFIA (600727), NFIB (600728), NFIC, and NFIX.

GENE STRUCTURE

Grunder et al. (2003) determined that the NFIX gene contains 11 exons.
By ortholog comparisons using protein sequences from 7 vertebrate
species, they identified 9 NFIX variants that are produced by
alternative splicing.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Seisenberger et al. (1993) mapped
the NFIX gene to 19p13. Secondary sites of hybridization were observed
at 5p15, 1q42-q44, 1p22-p21, and 20p1.3; this hybridization was
attributed to partial sequence homologies with related NFI genes.

By FISH, Qian et al. (1995) mapped the NFIA and NFIB genes to
chromosomes 1p31.3-p31.2 and 9p24.1, respectively. The NFIC and NFIX
genes were both localized to 19p13.3 in the order cen--NFIX--NFIC--tel.
Comparison of the position of NFI genes and JUN genes revealed a close
physical linkage between members of the NFI and JUN gene families; for
example, one JUN gene (165160) is on 1p32-p31, and both JUNB (165161)
and JUND (165162) are located on 19p.

Scherthan et al. (1994) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map
the murine Nfix gene to chromosome 8C1-C2, confirming the segmental
homology between human chromosome 19p13 and mouse chromosome 8C.
Although the location of the other NFI genes in the mouse had not been
established, Qian et al. (1995) suggested that from the imperative map
between human and mouse, the Nfia could be predicted to be located on
mouse chromosome 4 where the murine c-jun is located and the Nfic locus
on mouse chromosome 8 where the murine junD and junB genes are located.
They speculated further that a genomic unit containing an ancestral NFI
gene and an ancestral JUN gene existed early in evolution, later
duplicated twice, and then underwent further changes. If this hypothesis
is correct, one can suspect the existence of a fourth member of the JUN
gene family, probably located close to the NFIB gene. The postulated
fourth JUN gene would then be predicted to map to human 9 at 9p24.1 and
murine chromosome 4.

By FISH, Grunder et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Nfix gene to the distal
region of chromosome 8C.

GENE FUNCTION

Malan et al. (2010) performed RT-PCR analysis and demonstrated
ubiquitous expression of NFIX in all human tissues and cell types
tested, including chondrocytes and osteoblasts. In situ hybridization in
normal human embryos at CS17 (gestational day 42) showed a nearly
ubiquitous expression of NFIX, with prominent expression in the central
nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. In fetal brain at 22
weeks' gestation, NFIX was expressed in the cerebral cortex, in the
hippocampus, and faintly in the thalamus. In the skeleton, NFIX
expression was first noticed at CS17 in the mandibular arch, the
cartilage primordium of the humerus, the scapula, and the vertebrae. In
the limb, NFIX expression was first observed at CS17 in the
perichondrium. At 14 weeks' gestation, NFIX was highly expressed in the
proliferating zone of the digit. The study of distal femoral growth
plates of 1- to 5-week-old mice and human fetus revealed strong NFIX
expression in bone and in prehypertrophic chondrocytes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Sotos Syndrome 2

Malan et al. (2010) used a high-resolution array CGH in 18 patients with
unexplained syndromic overgrowth and identified 2 patients with a de
novo 19p13.1 monosomy. The deletions involved a single common gene,
NFIX. Malan et al. (2010) then screened 76 patients with unexplained
syndromic overgrowth for NIFX mutations and identified a heterozygous
nonsense mutation (Q190X; 164005.0001) in 1 patient who had been
diagnosed with a 'Sotos-like syndrome' (SOTOS2; 614753). This patient
and the 2 patients with 19p13.1 monosomy had a similar phenotype
consisting of postnatal overgrowth, macrocephaly, advanced bone age,
long narrow face, high forehead, slender habitus, scoliosis, unusual
behavior characterized especially by anxiety, and mental retardation.
The variant was not observed in 300 control chromosomes.

Yoneda et al. (2012) examined NFIX by high-resolution melt analysis in
48 individuals who were suspected of having Sotos syndrome but who did
not have NSD1 (606681) abnormalities, which are found in Sotos
syndrome-1. They identified 2 heterozygous missense mutations in the
DNA-binding/dimerization domain of the NFIX protein
(164005.0011-164005.0012). Neither mutation was found in 250 healthy
Japanese controls.

- Marshall-Smith Syndrome

Based on an Nfix-deficient mouse model with a phenotype similar to that
in Marshall-Smith syndrome (MRSHSS; 602535), Malan et al. (2010)
screened 9 individuals with MRSHSS for NFIX mutations and found
heterozygosity for 7 independent frameshift mutations
(164005.0002-164005.0008) and 2 different mutations within the donor
splice site of exon 6 (164005.0009-164005.0010). All of the mutations
occurred de novo and were not found in 300 control chromosomes.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Malan et al. (2010) performed RT-PCR analysis of skin fibroblasts in 1
SOTOS2 patient and 3 MRSHSS patients with NFIX mutations. They showed
that the SOTOS2 phenotype is due to NFIX haploinsufficiency, whereas the
mutated RNAs in MRSHSS escape nonsense-mediated decay surveillance.
Malan et al. (2010) suggested that NFIX mutations causing MRSHSS
generate mutant proteins able to exert a dominant-negative effect over
the wildtype allele and result in a more severe phenotype closely
resembling the knockout mouse model phenotype.

ANIMAL MODEL

Driller et al. (2007) obtained Nfix -/- mice at a normal mendelian
ratio, but nearly all died before 1 month of age. Although Nfix -/-
newborns appeared normal, they developed a dome-shaped head, were unable
to fully open their eyes, had deformation of the spine, exhibited an
ataxic gait, and were unable to gain weight. Heterozygous mice showed a
slight weight reduction, but had no obvious anatomic or behavioral
defects. Except for reduced size, most organs of Nfix -/- mice appeared
histologically normal. However, the smaller digestive tract showed
pathologic thinning of intestinal walls and reduced blood supply, and a
general loss of muscle tissue was observed. Hydrocephalus, which
developed after birth and progressed with age, was associated with
partial agenesis of the corpus callosum in Nfix -/- and Nfix +/- mice.
Skeletal pathology, including impaired endochondral ossification and
decreased mineralization in femoral bone, also progressed with age and
was associated with reduced expression of tetranecin (TNA; 187520), a
protein involved in mineralization.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001

NFIX gene, predicting a gln190-to-ter (Q190X) substitution. RT-PCR
analysis of NFIX RNA in skin fibroblasts from this patient showed the
expression of a single wildtype allele, indicating nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay and haploinsufficiency.

In a 3-week-old patient with Marshall-Smith syndrome (602535), Malan et
al. (2010) identified a heterozygous splice site mutation (955+1G-A).
The mutation occurred de novo and was not observed in 300 control
chromosomes. Both normal and mutated alleles were found in patient
fibroblasts, suggesting that the mutation escapes nonsense-mediated
decay and has a dominant-negative effect.

DNA-binding/dimerization domain. The mutation may have been inherited
from his mother who was not available for study. The mutation was not
found in 250 healthy Japanese controls.

107740	TITLE *107740 APOLIPOPROTEIN D; APOD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) is a member of the alpha(2mu)-microglobulin
superfamily of carrier proteins also known as lipocalins (e.g.,
lipocalin-1; 151675). It is a protein component of high-density
lipoprotein in human plasma, comprising about 5% of total high-density
lipoprotein (Fielding and Fielding, 1980). It is a glycoprotein of
estimated molecular weight 33,000 Da. ApoD is closely associated with
the enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT; 606967) (summary
by Drayna et al., 1986).

CLONING

Drayna et al. (1986) reported the amino acid sequence of apoD based on
the nucleotide sequence of the coding portion of the APOD gene and on
the cloned cDNA sequence. The 169-amino acid protein bore little
similarity to other lipoprotein sequences but had a high degree of
homology to plasma retinol-binding protein (180250, 180260, 180280,
180290), a member of the alpha(2mu)-globulin superfamily. This
structural similarity may indicate some functional homology of these
proteins. ApoD mRNA has been detected in many tissues. Drayna et al.
(1987) described multiple RFLPs at the APOD locus. Kamboh et al. (1989)
demonstrated for the first time polymorphism of apolipoprotein D by an
isoelectric focusing-immunoblotting technique.

Zeng et al. (1996) identified apoD as apocrine secretion odor-binding
protein-2 (ASOB2), 1 of 2 glycoproteins that bind E-3-methyl-2-hexenoic
acid (E-3M2H), the most abundant axillary odor component in human males.
The authors used mass spectrometry to determine the amino acid sequence
and glycosylation pattern of ASOB2. The pattern of glycosylation for
axillary apoD differs from that reported for plasma apoD, suggesting to
Zeng et al. (1996) that there are different sites of expression for the
2 glycoproteins. In situ hybridization of an oligonucleotide probe
against apoD mRNA with axillary tissue demonstrated that the message for
synthesis of this protein is specific to the apocrine glands. These
results suggested a remarkable similarity between human axillary
secretions and nonhuman mammalian odor sources, where lipocalins have
been shown to carry the odoriferous signals used in pheromonal
communication.

GENE FUNCTION

Zeng et al. (1996) noted several studies in humans suggesting that
axillary odors and secretions from both males and females are a source
of chemical signals containing physiologically active components capable
of altering the female menstrual cycle. These alterations include the
menstrual synchrony effect first documented by McClintock (1971) in an
all-female living group and later replicated by others in coeducational
facilities (Graham and McGrew, 1980; Quadagno et al., 1981). In nonhuman
mammals such as rodents, estrous synchrony has been shown to be mediated
by airborne chemical signals (McClintock, 1978). Certain axillary
components currently function as chemical signals involved in the
regulation of reproductive function via alteration of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis; chemical signals for this mode of
action are termed primer pheromones. Characterization of the source of
the odor in the human axillary region is not only of commercial interest
but is also important biologically because axillary extracts can alter
the length and timing of the female menstrual cycle. In males, the most
abundant odor component is known to be E-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid
(E-3M2H), which is liberated from nonodorous apocrine secretions by
axillary microorganisms. In the apocrine gland secretions, 3M2H is
carried on the skin surface bound to 2 proteins, apocrine secretion
odor-binding proteins 1 and 2 (ASOB1 and ASOB2) with apparent molecular
masses of 45 kD and 26 kD, respectively (summary by Zeng et al., 1996).

MAPPING

Drayna et al. (1987) assigned the gene for APOD to 3p14.2-qter by dot
blot hybridization to DNA from sorted human chromosomes and by in situ
hybridization. Cellular retinol-binding proteins (180260, 180280) are
coded by chromosome 3; interstitial RBP (180290) is coded by a gene on
chromosome 10. Warden et al. (1992) demonstrated that the ApoD gene is
located on mouse chromosome 16.

614141	TITLE *614141 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; TRIM2
;;KIAA0517
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRIM2 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that directs
proteasome-mediated degradation of target proteins (Balastik et al.,
2008; Thompson et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned TRIM2, which they designated
KIAA0517. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its 3-prime
end. The deduced 792-amino acid protein had an apparent molecular mass
of 84 kD by SDS-PAGE. It shares weak similarity with mouse Tif1 (TRIM24;
603406). RT-PCR detected highest TRIM2 expression in human kidney,
followed by brain, ovary, and small intestine, with little to no
expression detected in other tissues examined.

Reymond et al. (2001) cloned mouse Trim2. The deduced protein contains
an N-terminal RING domain, followed by a B-box-2 domain, a coiled-coil
region, and 6 C-terminal NHL repeats. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected a 7.5-kb transcript in adult brain, kidney, pancreas,
and spleen. RNA in situ hybridization of embryonic mouse revealed
expression in central nervous system, gut, retina, lung, and kidney.
Mouse Trim2 was expressed in a filamentous cytoplasmic pattern in
transfected human cells.

Using in situ hybridization and histochemical staining of mouse nervous
system, Balastik et al. (2008) detected Trim2 expression in Purkinje
cells and deep nuclei of cerebellum; in ganglionic cell layer, inner
nuclear layer, and outer plexiform layer of retina; in pyramidal cells
of CA1 to CA3 hippocampal areas; in granule cells of dentate gyrus; and
in stratum radiatum. Trim2 was also expressed in spinal cord, dorsal
root ganglia, hindbrain, and midbrain.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro-translated proteins, Balastik et al. (2008) showed that
mouse Trim2 functioned as a ubiquitin ligase, using Ubch5a (UBE2D1;
602961) as a ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzyme in an autoubiquitination
reaction. Trim2 interacted with Nfl (NEFL; 162280) from mouse brain
lysates, and deletion of the NHL repeats of Trim2 abolished the
interaction. A ligase-dead Trim2 mutant had a dominant-negative effect
on Nfl ubiquitination.

A brief period of ischemia is accompanied by phosphorylation,
ubiquitination, and degradation of the cell death-promoting protein BIM
(BCL2L11; 603827), and this response protects neurons from subsequent
harmful ischemic challenge. Using primary rat cortical neurons subjected
to oxygen and glucose deprivation to model ischemia, Thompson et al.
(2011) identified Trim2 as the E3 ubiquitin ligase that promoted
ubiquitination and degradation of Bim following a preconditioning
ischemic episode. Human TRIM2 interacted with Bim in a cell-free
expression system, and the interaction depended upon p42 (MAPK1;
176948)/p44 (MAPK3; 601795)-mediated Bim serine phosphorylation.
Preconditioning-induced Bim degradation was blocked by proteasome
inhibition or knockdown of Trim2 via small hairpin RNA or
immunodepletion. Thompson et al. (2011) concluded that TRIM2 controls
the apoptotic response to ischemia by directing degradation of BIM
protein.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the TRIM2
gene to chromosome 4. Reymond et al. (2001) mapped the TRIM2 gene to
chromosome 4q27-q34 by radiation hybrid analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Finnish girl with autosomal recessive early-onset
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2R (CMT2R; 615490), Ylikallio et al.
(2013) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the TRIM2 gene
(614141.0001 and 614141.0002). The mutations were found by whole-exome
sequencing and segregated with the disorder in the family. The patient
had onset in early childhood of muscle weakness and atrophy affecting
the upper and lower distal extremities. She showed delayed onset of
walking and walked with a broad-based gait. She also had areflexia, pes
cavus, and decreased motor nerve conduction velocities. Sural nerve
biopsy was consistent with nonspecific axonal degeneration, and axons
showed abnormal accumulation of neurofilaments. Study of patient
fibroblasts showed significant deficiency of the TRIM2 protein,
consistent with a loss of function. Ylikallio et al. (2013) noted that
the neurofilament light chain is a ubiquitination target of TRIM2, and
suggested that abnormal axonal accumulation of neurofilaments underlies
the disorder. In addition, Trim2-null mice show a gait ataxia and
neurodegeneration accompanied by axonal swelling and development of
neurofilament aggregates, suggestive of impaired axonal transport. No
TRIM2 mutations were identified in a cohort of 87 patients with
early-onset CMT, indicating that mutations in this gene are a rare cause
of the disorder.

ANIMAL MODEL

Balastik et al. (2008) found that Trim -/- mice were indistinguishable
from wildtype and heterozygous littermates until about 1.5 months of
age, when they began to show intention tremor, followed by gait ataxia.
In later stages, Trim -/- mice suffered from episodes of spontaneous
generalized seizures. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed substantial
and progressive loss of Purkinje cells beginning at about postnatal day
50, with 85% loss of Purkinje cells by 5 months of age. Deep cerebellar
nuclei showed a similar progressive neurodegeneration. Caspase-3 (CASP3;
600636) immunoreactivity suggested that loss of Purkinje cells was due
to apoptosis. At 4 months of age, retinas of Trim -/- mice showed
reductions in inner nuclear layer, outer plexiform layer, and ganglionic
cells, whereas the photoreceptor layer was not altered.
Neurodegeneration in Trim2 -/- mice was accompanied by axonal swelling
and development of Nfl aggregates, suggestive of impaired axonal
transport.

In an 18-year-old Finnish girl with autosomal recessive early-onset
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2R (CMT2R; 615490), Ylikallio et al.
(2013) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the TRIM2 gene: a
c.680A-T transversion, resulting in a glu227-to-val (E227V) substitution
at a highly conserved residue in the coiled-coil domain, and a 1-bp
deletion (c.1699delA; 614141.0002), resulting in a frameshift and
premature termination (Lys567ArgfsTer7). The mutations were found by
whole-exome sequencing and segregated with the disorder in the family.
Neither were present in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes databases or in 366
Finnish control chromosomes. Studies of patient fibroblasts showed that
the c.1699delA mutant transcript underwent nonsense-mediated mRNA decay,
and that there were low levels of the E227V mutant protein, indicating
that it is unstable. Transfection of the E227V mutation into HEK293
cells confirmed reduced stability of the mutant protein. The findings
were consistent with a loss of TRIM2 function.

609269	TITLE *609269 KIAA0319 GENE; KIAA0319
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The KIAA0319 gene encodes a plasma membrane protein with a large, highly
glycosylated, extracellular domain. This protein is proposed to function
in adhesion and attachment and may play a role during neuronal migration
in the developing brain. In addition, cleavage of the protein may play a
role in intra- and extracellular signaling (summary by Velayos-Baeza et
al., 2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) cloned KIAA0319. The deduced 1,072-amino
acid protein has an apparent molecular mass of over 100 kD by SDS-PAGE.
RT-PCR detected low expression only in brain. The predicted size of the
full-length protein is 116 kD (Velayos-Baeza et al., 2010).

Cope et al. (2005) noted that 4 polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domains
in KIAA0319 show homology to the extracellular domains of PKD1 (601313),
which are involved in cell adhesive functions.

Paracchini et al. (2006) found expression of KIAA0319 in the developing
mouse and human brain. In mice, there was low expression in the frontal
neocortex, ganglionic eminence, mesencephalon, and cerebellum at
embryonic day (E) 13.5. Staining was more intense at E15.5 in the
cerebral neocortex and mesencephalon. By E18.5, when neuronal migration
is largely completed, KIAA0319 was expressed prominently in the cortical
plate (CP) and in the remnant of the ventricular zone (VZ), with less
intense expression in the subventricular zone (SVZ). In the adult mouse
brain, there was intense expression of KIAA0319 in the CA3 region of the
hippocampus and dentate gyrus, and in the Purkinje cell layer of the
cerebellum. In human fetal brain, KIAA0319 expression was found in the
developing neocortex, ganglionic eminence, CP, and VZ.

By database analysis and RT-PCR of adult and fetal whole brain,
Velayos-Baeza et al. (2007) identified a number of KIAA0319 splice
variants. Most alternative splicing affects the 5-prime UTR, coding
exons 2 through 4 at the 5-prime end, and coding exons 18 through 20 at
the 3-prime end. The dominant transcript, variant A, uses all exons. The
deduced full-length 1,072-amino acid protein has an N-terminal signal
peptide, followed by a 'motif at the N terminus with 7 cysteines'
(MANSC), 5 central tandem PKD domains, a motif with 6 cysteines (C6), a
transmembrane domain, and a short C terminus, as well as putative N- and
O-glycosylation sites. The common variants B and C lack exon 19 and
exons 19 and 20, respectively, and encode proteins lacking the
C-terminal transmembrane domain. Northern blot analysis detected a major
transcript of 7.5 to 8 kb that was widely expressed in brain, notably in
cerebellum, cerebral cortex, putamen, amygdala, and hippocampus. Weaker
expression of transcripts of about 4.5 and 2.5 kb was also detected.
Alternative splicing patterns similar, but not identical, to those
observed for human KIAA0319 were detected in the mouse and rat
orthologs.

Velayos-Baeza et al. (2008) found that the MANSC domain of KIAA0319
(Velayos-Baeza et al., 2007) is actually a MANEC (motif at the N
terminus with eight cysteines) domain. Using coimmunoprecipitation and
Western blot analysis of epitope-tagged proteins, Velayos-Baeza et al.
(2008) determined that KIAA0319 isoform A predominantly formed dimers
under nonreducing conditions; however, monomers and higher order
oligomers were also observed. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that
isoform A localized to the plasma membrane of transfected human lung
fibroblasts and that the N terminus was extracellular and the C terminus
was cytoplasmic. Biochemical analysis confirmed that isoform A was N-
and O-glycosylated. Isoforms B and C, which lack the transmembrane
domain, were secreted into the culture medium and retained in the
endoplasmic reticulum, respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Velayos-Baeza et al. (2007) determined that the KIAA0319 gene contains
21 exons and spans 102 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the KIAA0319
gene to chromosome 6. Cope et al. (2005) noted that the KIAA0319 gene
resides within a dyslexia susceptibility region on chromosome 6p22.2
(DYX2; 600202).

GENE FUNCTION

Using deletion and mutation analyses, Velayos-Baeza et al. (2008) showed
that the transmembrane domain of the full-length KIAA0319 isoform was
necessary for plasma membrane localization. The C6 domain was required
for dimerization, and the transmembrane domain strengthened dimer
interactions.

Levecque et al. (2009) observed that KIAA0319 often colocalized with the
early endosomal marker EEA1 (605070) in juxtanuclear vesicles in human
cell lines. Internalization of KIAA0319 was dependent on RAB5 (179512),
a key regulator of early endocytosis. Yeast 2-hybrid and protein
pull-down assays showed that KIAA0319 interacted with the mu-2 subunit
(AP2M1; 601024) of the adaptor protein-2 (AP2) complex, which is
involved in internalization of proteins through the clathrin (see CLTC;
118955)-mediated endocytosis pathway. Deletion and mutation analysis
revealed that the YTIL motif in the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region of
KIAA0319 mediated the interaction of KIA0319 with AP2 mu-2. Mutation of
Y995 within this motif prevented binding between KIAA0319 and AP2 mu-2.
RNA interference-mediated depletion of AP2 mu-2 or CLTC in HeLa cells
prevented internalization of KIAA0319. Levecque et al. (2009) concluded
that surface expression of KIAA0319 is regulated by the classical
clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway.

By in vitro studies of HEK293 cells, Velayos-Baeza et al. (2010) showed
that KIAA0319 undergoes ectodomain shedding and intramembrane cleavage,
releasing N-terminal fragments, including the MANEC domain, into the
extracellular domain, and C-terminal intracellular fragments into the
cytoplasm. The process involved at least 5 different cleavage events, 4
in the extracellular domain and 1 within the transmembrane domain, but
the cleavage was not carried out by gamma-secretase (see PSEN1; 104311).
The soluble cytoplasmic domain of KIAA0319 translocated to the nucleus
and accumulated in nucleoli, suggesting a possible indirect role in the
regulation of gene expression. These results suggested that KIAA0319 may
have signaling functions in addition to a direct role in neuronal
migration.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
KIAA0319 gene and dyslexia, see DYX2 (600202).

In individuals with dyslexia, Francks et al. (2004) found an association
between dyslexia and a 77-kb region on chromosome 6p22.2 spanning the
TTRAP gene (605764) and the first 4 exons of KIAA0319. One main risk
haplotype (1-1-2) for reading disability (frequency of approximately
12%) was found in both U.K. and U.S. samples: the 1-1-2 haplotype
comprised dbSNP rs4504469, dbSNP rs2038137, and dbSNP rs2143340.

Cope et al. (2005) found that 6 SNPs in the 6p22.2 region showed
significant evidence of association with dyslexia, including a SNP in
exon 4 of the KIAA0319 gene that changed an amino acid (A311T, dbSNP
rs4504469). Haplotype data implicated KIAA0319 as a susceptibility gene
for dyslexia.

In lymphoblastoid and neuroblastoma cell lines, Paracchini et al. (2006)
found that heterozygosity for the 1-1-2 haplotype identified by Francks
et al. (2004) resulted in a decrease of KIAA0319 expression by about
40%, but did not affect expression of the neighboring TTRAP or THEM2
genes. The effect on gene expression could not be detected by looking at
individual SNPs, but only by the haplotype background. The authors used
matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)
mass spectrometry to assess quantitative allele-specific transcripts.
Paracchini et al. (2006) noted that reading disability may be related to
irregularities in neuronal migration, and suggested that downregulation
of KIAA0319 may be a susceptibility factor in the development of
dyslexia when combined with other genetic and environmental factors.

ANIMAL MODEL

Paracchini et al. (2006) found expression of KIAA0319 in the developing
rodent brain. RNA interference (RNAi) of KIAA0319 in rats disrupted
neuronal migration and caused migrating neurons to assume an orthogonal
rather than parallel orientation to radial glial fibers. The findings
were suggestive of a role for KIAA0319 in neuronal migration during
formation of the cerebral cortex.
