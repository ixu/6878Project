605434	TITLE *605434 CLASPIN, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF; CLSPN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kumagai and Dunphy (2000) identified a Xenopus protein, which they
designated claspin, that binds to Xenopus Chk1 (CHEK1; 603078). By
searching an EST database for sequences related to Xenopus claspin, they
identified the human homolog. The full-length cDNA sequence of human
claspin encodes a predicted 1,332-amino acid polypeptide that is 49%
identical to Xenopus claspin.

GENE FUNCTION

Kumagai and Dunphy (2000) found that binding of claspin to Xenopus Chk1
was highly elevated in the presence of DNA templates that triggered a
checkpoint arrest of the cell cycle in Xenopus egg extracts. Xenopus
Chk1 became phosphorylated during a checkpoint response, and this
phosphorylation resulted in the activation of Xenopus Chk1.
Immunodepletion of claspin from egg extracts abolished both the
phosphorylation and activation of Xenopus Chk1. Furthermore,
claspin-depleted extracts were unable to arrest the cell cycle in
response to DNA replication blocks. These findings indicated that
claspin is an essential upstream regulator of Chk1 in Xenopus.

Lee et al. (2003) showed that Xenopus claspin associates with chromatin
in a regulated manner during S phase. Binding of claspin to chromatin
depended on the prereplication complex and Cdc45 (603465), but not on
replication protein A (RPA; 179835). These dependencies suggested that
binding of claspin occurs around the time of initial DNA unwinding at
replication origins. By contrast, both Atr (601215) and Rad17 (603139)
required Rpa for association with DNA. Claspin, Atr, and Rad17 all bound
to chromatin independently. These findings suggested that claspin plays
a role in monitoring DNA replication during S phase.

Chini and Chen (2003) observed that human claspin is a cell
cycle-regulated protein that peaks at S/G2 phase. Claspin localized in
nuclei and associated with CHK1 following replication stress or other
types of DNA damage. Claspin was phosphorylated in response to
replication stress, and phosphorylation appeared to be required for the
association between claspin and CHK1. In addition, claspin interacted
with the checkpoint proteins ATR and RAD9 (603761). Since ATR and the
RAD9-RAD1 (603153)-HUS1 (603760) complex are involved in CHK1
activation, the authors hypothesized that claspin may be an adaptor that
brings these molecules together. Downregulation of claspin by small
interfering RNA inhibited CHK1 activation in response to replication
stress, augmented the premature chromatin condensation induced by
hydroxyurea, inhibited ultraviolet-induced reduction of DNA synthesis,
and decreased cell survival.

Yoo et al. (2004) showed that, during checkpoint response, Xenopus
claspin becomes phosphorylated on thr906, creating a docking site for
Plx1, the Xenopus homolog of PLK1 (602098). This interaction promotes
phosphorylation of claspin on ser934 by Plx1. Yoo et al. (2004) stated
that, after a prolonged interphase arrest, aphidicolin-treated egg
extracts typically undergo adaptation and enter into mitosis despite the
presence of incompletely replicated DNA. In this process, claspin
dissociates from chromatin, and Chk1 undergoes inactivation. By
contrast, aphidicolin-treated extracts containing mutants of claspin
with thr906-to-ala or ser934-to-ala substitutions were unable to undergo
adaptation. Under such adaptation-defective conditions, claspin
accumulated on chromatin at high levels, and Chk1 did not decrease in
activity. These results indicated that the Plx1-dependent inactivation
of claspin results in termination of a DNA replication checkpoint
response.

Wang et al. (2006) found that phosphorylated RAD17 interacted with
claspin and regulated its phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of RAD17 was
differentially required in response to different DNA-damaging agents and
was particularly important in stress due to hydroxyurea exposure.

Mailand et al. (2006) and Peschiaroli et al. (2006) found that claspin
became degraded at the onset of mitosis. Claspin degradation was
triggered by its interaction with and ubiquitylation by BTRC (603482).
The BTRC-claspin interaction was phosphorylation dependent and required
PLK1 activity and integrity of the BTRC degradation motif in the N
terminus of claspin. Mailand et al. (2006) found that uncoupling claspin
from BTRC by mutating the conserved serines in the degradation motif or
by BTRC knockdown stabilized claspin in mitosis, impaired CHK1
dephosphorylation, and delayed G2/M transition during recovery from cell
cycle arrest imposed by DNA damage or replication stress. The inability
to degrade claspin allowed partial reactivation of CHK1 in cells exposed
to DNA damage after passing the G2/M transition. Peschiaroli et al.
(2006) found that expression of a stable claspin mutant unable to bind
BTRC prolonged activation of CHK1, thereby attenuating recovery from the
DNA replication stress response and significantly delaying entry into
mitosis.

MAPPING

Kumagai and Dunphy (2000) mapped the human claspin gene to 1p34.3-p34.1
based on sequence similarity between the claspin sequence (GenBank
GENBANK AF297866) and the chromosome 1 clone RP4-555P23 (GenBank GENBANK
AL139143).
