;;DEF3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Gure et al. (1998) identified RBM6, which they called NY-LU-12, by
immunoscreening a recombinant lung cancer cDNA expression library with
autologous patient serum. They cloned the full-length cDNA from normal
testis mRNA through a combination of 5-prime RACE and direct PCR. In
addition to the dominant transcript, they identified 3 minor forms that
contain additional exon(s). The deduced 1,123-amino acid major protein
contains 20 inexact 6-amino acid repeats close to the N terminus; 2
RNA-binding domains; 2 zinc finger motifs; a bipartite nuclear
localization signal; and a 4-residue nuclear localization pattern. They
noted that all of the predicted functional domains in RBM6 are also
present in RBM5 (606884), with which it shares 30% identity. Northern
blot analysis detected several RBM6 transcripts, ranging from
approximately 3 to 4.4 kb, in all tissues examined. Highest expression
was in liver, with intermediate expression in placenta, lung, skeletal
muscle, and kidney. Southern blot analysis showed no evidence of
homozygous deletion of RBM6 in tumor cell lines, the gene being
partially deleted in only 1 of 9 lung cancer cell lines.

Drabkin et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding RBM6, which they called
DEF3, by positional cloning from a small cell lung carcinoma homozygous
deletion region on chromosome 3p21.3. The human and mouse RBM6 proteins
share 89% amino acid identity. Northern blot analysis indicated highest
expression in heart, intermediate levels in brain, placenta, liver,
skeletal muscle, and pancreas, and low expression in lung and kidney. In
hematopoietic tissues, highest expression was in lymph node and thymus,
with lower expression in bone marrow. Two bands were observed in
peripheral blood leukocytes and fetal liver. Northern blot analysis
showed constitutive expression of mouse Rbm6 during embryogenesis, as
well as expression in all adult mouse tissues examined.

Timmer et al. (1999) identified a YAC clone corresponding to chromosome
3p21.3 that is deleted in the small cell lung cancer cell line GLC20.
They isolated and cloned RBM6 by direct hybridization of this YAC clone
to a lung cDNA library. Northern blot analysis identified RBM6
transcripts of 4.7, 3.9, and 2.1 kb in all tissues tested. Although RBM6
maps to the critical region homozygously deleted in a small cell lung
carcinoma cell line, the authors found that the 5-prime end crosses the
telomeric breakpoint of the deletion. Northern and Southern analyses of
a number of lung cancer cell lines revealed no patterns of aberrant RBM6
expression.

GENE FUNCTION

Drabkin et al. (1999) found that recombinant proteins containing the RNA
recognition motifs of RBM5 or RBM6 specifically bind poly(G) RNA
homopolymers in vitro.

GENE STRUCTURE

Timmer et al. (1999) determined that the RBM6 gene contains 20 exons.

MAPPING

Timmer et al. (1999) identified the RBM5 gene within a YAC clone
corresponding to chromosome 3p21.3. By FISH, Heng et al. (2000) mapped
the mouse gene to chromosome 9F1-F2.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By large-scale sequence analysis of chromosome 21q, Slavov et al. (2000)
identified DONSON, which they called B17. RT-PCR showed B17 expression
in HeLa cells, 8-week fetus, 10-week fetus, fetal brain, adult brain,
cerebellum, hippocampus, occipital lobe, and vermis.

GENE STRUCTURE

By sequence analysis, Slavov et al. (2000) predicted that the DONSON
gene contains at least 7 exons spanning 10 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Slavov et al. (2000) mapped the DONSON
gene to chromosome 21q22.1.

Wynn et al. (2000) determined that both human and mouse SON (182465) and
DONSON are in tail-to-tail orientation and in the following order: GART
(138440)-SON-DONSON.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching EST databases with genomic sequences obtained from CpG
islands located in the Xq28 region, Faranda et al. (1996) identified a
gene, which they called ITBA2. The gene is relatively short, contains a
105-amino acid open reading frame, and is ubiquitously expressed.

MAPPING

Faranda et al. (1996) showed that the ITBA2 gene maps close to the GDX
gene (312070) on Xq28 in the interval between the red-green color vision
genes (300822; 300821) and G6PD (305900). It is centromeric to GDX and
is transcribed in the same orientation.

NOMENCLATURE

Faranda (1996) indicated that the designation ITBA2 for this gene was
arbitrarily chosen from the acronym of the institute where she works,
Istituto di Tecnologie Biomediche Avanzate, in Milan, Italy.

;;SERINE/ARGININE-RICH SPLICING FACTOR 7;;
SPLICING FACTOR, ARGININE/SERINE-RICH, 7; SFRS7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cavaloc et al. (1994) used a monoclonal antibody to identify a splicing
factor of 35 kD which they named 9G8. Based on partial sequence of
tryptic peptides, the authors designed degenerate PCR primers and
obtained a PCR product which was used to probe genomic and cDNA
libraries. The isolation and characterization of cDNA clones indicated
that the 9G8 protein (gene symbol, SFRS7) is a member of the
serine/arginine (SR) splicing factor family because it includes an
N-terminal RNA binding domain and a C-terminal SR domain. Members of
this family are thought to play key roles in alternative splicing. The
RNA binding domain of 9G8 is closely related (79 to 71% identity) to
those of the SR factors human SRp20 (603364) and Drosophila RBP1.
Immunodepletion of the 9G8 protein from a nuclear extract resulted in
the loss of splicing activity. In turn, in vitro-expressed recombinant
9G8 protein rescued the splicing activity of a 9G8-depleted nuclear
extract.

GENE STRUCTURE

Popielarz et al. (1995) isolated and characterized the human 9G8 gene.
The gene spans 7,745 bp and consists of 8 exons and 7 introns within the
coding sequence, thus contrasting with the organization of some other
genes of the SR splicing factor family. The 5-prime flanking region is
GC-rich and contains basal promoter sequences and potential regulatory
elements. They presented results raising the possibility that
alternative splicing of intron 3 provides a mechanism for modulation of
the 9G8 function.

GENE FUNCTION

Lareau et al. (2007) reported that in every member of the human SR
family of splicing regulators, highly or ultraconserved elements are
alternatively spliced, either as alternative 'poison cassette exons'
containing early in-frame stop codons, or as alternative introns in the
3-prime untranslated region. These alternative splicing events target
the resulting mRNAs for degradation by means of an RNA surveillance
pathway called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Mouse orthologs of the
human SR proteins exhibit the same unproductive splicing patterns. Three
SR proteins, SRp20 (603364), SC35 (600813), and 9G8 (SFRS7), had been
previously shown to direct splicing of their own transcripts, and SC35
autoregulates its expression by coupling alternative splicing with
decay. Lareau et al. (2007) concluded that unproductive splicing is
important for regulation of the entire SR family and found that
unproductive splicing associated with conserved regions has arisen
independently in different SR genes, suggesting that splicing factors
may readily acquire this form of regulation.

MAPPING

By isotopic in situ hybridization, Popielarz et al. (1995) localized the
SFRS7 gene to 2p22-p21.

;;SMOOTH MUSCLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 8; SMAP8;;
KIAA1180
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Hirosawa et al. (1999) cloned NDRG4. The deduced protein
contains 273 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest expression in
adult and fetal brain and adult heart, followed by lung and testis.
Lower expression was detected in other adult tissues examined, but
little to no expression was detected in fetal liver. High NDRG4
expression was detected in all specific adult brain regions examined,
with highest expression in amygdala, cerebellum, and thalamus.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to NDRG1 (605262),
followed by 3-prime and 5-prime RACE of human brain and heart cDNA
libraries and cap-site hunting, Zhou et al. (2001) cloned 3 splice
variants of NDRG4. The variants NDRG4B and NDRG4B-var, which were
obtained from the brain library, encode deduced proteins of 339 and 352
amino acids with calculated molecular masses of 37.1 and 38.5 kD,
respectively. Compared with NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var has a 14-amino acid
insertion near the C terminus. The variant NDRG4H, which was obtained
from the heart library, encodes a deduced 371-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of 40.6 kD. NDRG4H differs from NDRG4B and
NDRG4B-var at its N-terminal end, and it lacks the 14-amino acid
insertion. Northern blot analysis detected NDRG4 transcripts of about
3.2 kb in brain and heart only. Variant-specific probes showed NDRG4B
expression in brain only, whereas NDRG4H was expressed in both brain and
heart, with higher expression in heart. RT-PCR confirmed expression of
all 3 variants in brain and of NDRG4H in heart. RNA dot-blot analysis
revealed NDRG4 expression in spinal cord, all specific brain regions
examined, and all specific heart regions examined except aorta.
Expression was also detected in spleen, lymph node, testis, adrenal
gland, and fetal brain and heart, but not in other tissues examined. In
situ hybridization of normal adult brain detected NDRG4 mRNA in
cytoplasm of neurons in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, mesencephalon,
pons, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. No signal was detected in
peripheral nerves or other cell types, such as glial cells. Western blot
analysis of endogenous or exogenously expressed proteins showed that
NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var, and NDRG4H had apparent molecular masses of 37, 39,
and 41 kD, respectively.

Using expression profiling to identify genes expressed in aortic smooth
muscle, followed by screening a heart cDNA library, Nishimoto et al.
(2003) cloned NDRG4, which they called SMAP8. The deduced 371-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 40.7 kD. Northern blot
analysis detected high expression of an approximately 3.3-kb transcript
in heart and brain, with little to no expression in other tissues
examined. PCR analysis showed moderate expression in aorta and vascular
smooth muscle cells. Western blot analysis of heart and brain detected
SMAP8 at an apparent molecular mass of about 45 kD. SMAP8 localized to
the cytoplasmic fraction of transfected A10 embryonic rat aortic smooth
muscle cells.

By in situ hybridization of adult mouse brain, Yamamoto et al. (2011)
detected wide distribution of Ndrg4 in neurons, but not in astrocytes.
Western blot analysis of adult mouse brain detected 3 Ndrg4 isoforms
representing orthologs of human NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var, and NDRG4H.

GENE FUNCTION

Nishimoto et al. (2003) showed that homocysteine upregulated SMAP8
expression in primary human aortic smooth muscle cells and rat A10
cells, but not in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Proliferation
and migration of A10 cells significantly decreased following expression
of human SMAP8. SMAP8 was phosphorylated by a serine/threonine kinase
via activation of a PDGF (see 173430) signaling pathway. In addition,
ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948) and MEK1 (MAP2K1; 176872)/MEK2
(MAP2K2; 601263) were activated in SMAP8-transfected A10 cells.

Hongo et al. (2006) found that overexpression of 1 of the 6 isoforms of
rat Ndrg4, Ndrg4c2, in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells reduced NGF (see
162030)-induced phosphorylation of Elk1 (311040), a nuclear target of
Erk. Reporter gene assays revealed that Ndrg4c2 suppressed Elk1-mediated
activation of a serum response element.

By RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis, Schilling et al. (2009)
found that NDRG4 expression was increased in glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM; see 137800) compared with normal human astrocytes. Knockdown of
NDRG4 via short hairpin RNA reduced the viability of GBM cells via G1
cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis. Knockdown of NDRG4 also
reduced the viability of several GBM cell lines and primary astrocytes.
Knockdown of NDRG4 in GBM tumor xenografts reduced tumor growth
following intracranial injection in immunocompromised mice.
Overexpression of NDRG4B or NDRG4H did not affect cell viability.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhou et al. (2001) determined that the NDRG4 gene contains 17 exons and
spans 26 kb. Exons 1 and 2 are specific for NDRG4H, exon 3 is specific
for NDRG4B and NDGR4B-var, and exon 16 is specific for NDRG4B-var. The
region upstream of exon 1 contains a GGCG sequence that may represent a
TATA-less promoter for NDRG4H expression. The region upstream of exon 3
contains a consensus TATA box and 2 CCAAT sequences and may represent
the promoter for NDRG4B and NDRG4B-var expression.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhou et al. (2001) mapped the NDRG4 gene
to chromosome 16q21-q22.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yamamoto et al. (2011) found that Ndrg4 -/- mice were born at the
expected mendelian ratio, appeared normal, and were fertile. However,
Ndrg4 -/- mice showed deficits in spatial learning and memory, and they
exhibited increased sensitivity to ischemic stress following middle
cerebral artery occlusion. Consistent with these findings, Ndrg4 -/-
mice had reduced expression of the neuroprotective factor Bdnf (113505).

605213	TITLE *605213 3-@PHOSPHOINOSITIDE-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE 1; PDPK1
;;PDK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Isoforms of protein kinase B (PKB, or AKT1; 164730) are overexpressed in
some ovarian, pancreatic, and breast cancer cells, and PKB has been
shown to protect cells from apoptosis. Activation of PKB, which is
preventable by inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (see PIK3CG;
601232), is stimulated by insulin or growth factors after
phosphorylation of PKB at thr308 and ser473. Alessi et al. (1997)
biochemically purified a protein kinase, which they called PDK1, that
phosphorylates PKB at thr308 in response to phosphatidylinositol
3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) or phosphatidylinositol
3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) and enhances PKB activity. By
microsequence analysis of the approximately 67- to 69-kD PDK1 protein,
searching an EST database, and probing a breast cancer cell line cDNA
library, Alessi et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding PDK1, also called
PDPK1. Sequence analysis predicted that the 556-amino acid PDPK1 protein
contains a catalytic domain with 11 classic kinase subdomains and a
C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Alessi et al. (1997) found that expression of recombinant PDPK1 resulted
in the activation and phosphorylation of PKB at thr308 in a
PtdIns(3,4,5)P3- or PtdIns(3,4)P2-dependent manner via the PH domains.

Stephens et al. (1998) demonstrated that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and
PtdIns(3,4)P2 bind to the PH domains of PKB and PDPK1, causing their
translocation to the membrane and leading to PKB activation.

Pullen et al. (1998) showed that PDPK1 selectively phosphorylates the
70-kD ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70-RPS6K) at thr229, which is
required for its activation. Thr229 of p70-RPS6K is homologous to thr308
of the PKB protein.

Using transfected HEK293 cells stimulated with pervanadate or insulin,
Park et al. (2001) found that PDK1 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and
translocates to the plasma membrane. Following pervanadate treatment,
PDK1 kinase activity increased 1.5- to 3-fold, whereas the activity of
PDK1 associated with the plasma membrane increased approximately 6-fold.
The activity localized to the plasma membrane was also increased by
insulin treatment. Using site-directed mutants, they determined that
phosphorylation of tyr373/tyr376 is important for PDK1 activity.

Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B (see 164011) after
engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) is important for T cell
proliferation and activation during the adaptive immune response. Lee et
al. (2005) demonstrated that PDK1 has an essential role in this pathway
by regulating the activation of PKC-theta (PRKCQ; 600448) and through
signal-dependent recruiting of both PKC-theta and CARD11 (607210) to
lipid rafts. PDK1-associated PKC-theta recruits the IKK complex, whereas
PDK1-associated CARD11 recruits the Bcl10-MALT1 complex (see 604860),
thereby allowing activation of the IKK complex through
Bcl10-MALT1-dependent ubiquitination of the IKK complex subunit NEMO
(300248). Lee et al. (2005) concluded that PDK1 plays a critical role by
nucleating the TCR-induced NF-kappa-B activation pathway in T cells.

Gruber et al. (2006) commented on the study of Lee et al. (2005),
stating they observed that PKC-theta is phosphorylated on the activation
loop at thr538 before T cell activation. The results of Gruber et al.
(2006) are therefore inconsistent with the conclusions of Lee et al.
(2005) that thr538 phosphorylation of PKC-theta is regulated by T-cell
receptor activation. They postulated that other mechanisms, such as
autophosphorylation of thr219, might orchestrate the cellular function
of PKC-theta in T cells. Lee et al. (2006) responded to the comments of
Gruber et al. (2006) to state that several other groups have replicated
their data regarding inducible phosphorylation of thr538 in T cells. Lee
et al. (2006) noted that although the physiologic relevance of the
discrepancy is unclear, substantial differences and experimental
conditions and reagents may have accounted for the conflicting
observations.

In 3-dimensional matrices, cancer cells move with a rounded, amoeboid
morphology that is controlled by ROCK1-dependent contraction of
actomyosin. Using human cancer cell lines, Pinner and Sahai (2008)
showed that PDK1 was required for phosphorylation of myosin light chain
(see 160780) and cell motility, both on deformable gels and in vivo.
Depletion of PDK1 via RNA interference altered the localization of ROCK1
and reduced its ability to drive cortical actomyosin contraction. This
form of ROCK1 regulation did not require PDK1 kinase activity. Instead,
PDK1 competed directly with RHOE (RND3; 602924) for binding to ROCK1 and
opposed inhibition of ROCK1 by RHOE.

MAPPING

Alessi et al. (1997) and Stephens et al. (1998) mapped the PDPK1 gene to
16p13.3 based on its identity to a sequence located in the same region
as the PKD1 (601313) and TSC2 (191092) loci (Burn et al., 1996).

ANIMAL MODEL

Lawlor et al. (2002) found that Pdk1-null mice died at embryonic day 9.5
with multiple abnormalities, including lack of somites, forebrain, and
neural crest-derived tissues. Development of hind- and midbrain,
however, proceeded relatively normally. Lawlor et al. (2002) developed a
mouse strain that showed reduced levels of Pdk1 activity. These
hypomorphic Pdk1 mice were viable and fertile, and insulin injection
induced the normal phosphorylation responses attributed to Pdk1
activation. Nevertheless, these mice were 40 to 50% smaller than control
animals. The organ volumes from the Pdk1 hypomorphic mice were reduced
proportionally, and the volume of a number of Pdk1-deficient cells was
reduced by 35 to 60%. Pdk1 deficiency seemed to regulate cell size
directly and independently of cell number or proliferation rate.

The PDK1 'master kinase' mediates activation of AGC serine kinases (PKA,
PKG, and PKC (see 176960)) by phosphorylating them at the 'T-loop' site
of their catalytic domains. In order to determine the role of AGC serine
kinases in T-cell development, Hinton et al. (2004) used conditional
gene deletion of Pdk1 in mouse T cells to avoid embryonic lethality.
Complete loss of Pdk1 blocked T-cell differentiation in thymus, whereas
reducing Pdk1 activity to 10% of normal allowed differentiation to
proceed but blocked thymic expansion.

Hashimoto et al. (2006) investigated the role of PDK1, a
serine-threonine kinase, in regulating islet mass via a signaling
pathway that includes INSR (147670) or IGF1R (147370), IRS1 (147545),
and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Hashimoto et al. (2006) showed
that mice lacking Pdk1 specifically in pancreatic beta cells developed
progressive hyperglycemia as a result of loss of islet mass. The mice
showed reductions in islet density as well as in number and size of beta
cells. Haploinsufficiency of the Foxo1 gene (136533) resulted in a
marked increase in the number, but not the size, of beta cells and
resulted in restoration of glucose homeostasis in beta cell-specific
Pdk1-null mice. Hashimoto et al. (2006) suggested that PDK1 is important
in maintenance of pancreatic beta cell mass and glucose homeostasis.

In mice lacking Pdk1 in oocytes, Reddy et al. (2009) demonstrated that
the majority of primordial follicles were depleted around the onset of
sexual maturity, causing premature ovarian failure (POF) during early
adulthood. Suppressed PDK1-Akt1 (164730)-S6K1 (RPS6KB1; 608938)-RPS6
(180460) signaling in oocytes appeared to be responsible for the loss of
primordial follicles, and mice lacking the Rps6 gene in oocytes showed
POF similar to that in Pdk1-deficient mice. Reddy et al. (2009)
concluded that the PI3K/PTEN (601728)-PDK1 signaling pathway in oocytes
controls the survival, loss, and activation of primordial follicles
(which together determine reproductive aging and the length of
reproductive life in females), and that underactivation or
overactivation of the pathway in oocytes may cause POF and infertility.

612658	TITLE *612658 TIGHT JUNCTION-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; TJAP1
;;PROTEIN INCORPORATED LATER INTO TIGHT JUNCTIONS; PILT;;
TIGHT JUNCTION PROTEIN 4; TJP4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse 11-day-old embryo library using
human DLG2 (603583) SH3 and GK domains as bait, Kawabe et al. (2001)
cloned mouse Tjap1, which they called Pilt. By database analysis, they
identified full-length human TJAP1, which encodes a 547-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 60.7 kD. TJAP1 contains an
N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a central proline-rich region, and
shares 74% amino acid identity with its mouse homolog. TJAP1 shares 43%
and 51% amino acid identity over its N-terminal and C-terminal regions,
respectively, with the same regions of BEGAIN. SDS-PAGE detected TJAP1
as an 86-kD band. Northern blot analysis detected an approximately
3.0-kb transcript in all 16 human tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunofluorescence microscopy of mouse mammary tumor cells, Kawabe et
al. (2001) localized TJAP1 to cell-cell junctions where it colocalized
with ZO-1 (TJP1; 601009) at tight junctions. Using endogenous and stably
expressed TJAP1, the authors confirmed colocalization of TJAP1 and ZO-1
to tight junctions in small intestine cells where TJAP1 localized to the
Golgi complex. TJAP1 was absent from apical junctions and desmosomes. By
observing TJAP1 incorporation into cell-cell junctions over time in a
mouse wound healing model, the authors showed that TJAP1 was
incorporated into tight junctions at the very late stages of cell-cell
junction formation. Kawabe et al. (2001) used GST pull-down assays to
confirm that TJAP1 binds DLG2. Immunohistochemical studies using
cadherin deficient L-cells expressing claudin-1 (CLDN1; 603718) or JAM
(JAM1; 605721) showed no evidence of interaction between TJAP1 and
either of these 2 proteins.

609671	TITLE *609671 SIX-TRANSMEMBRANE EPITHELIAL ANTIGEN OF PROSTATE 3; STEAP3
;;TUMOR SUPPRESSOR-ACTIVATED PATHWAY 6; TSAP6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Passer et al. (2003) cloned human STEAP3, which they called TSAP6, from
a pooled-tissue cDNA library. The deduced 488-amino acid protein
contains an N-terminal motif associated with oxidoreductases and
dehydrogenases and 5 or 6 transmembrane domains. Human TSAP6 shares 87%
amino acid identity with mouse Tsap6. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected a 4.3-kb transcript expressed highly in liver and at a
lower level in skeletal muscle. Heart, brain, placenta, lung, kidney,
and pancreas expressed little to no TSAP6. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected expression predominantly in heart, spleen, lung,
liver, and skeletal muscle. Western blot analysis of mouse and human
cell lines detected TSAP6 at an apparent molecular mass of 50 to 55 kD.

Using Western blot analysis, Lespagnol et al. (2008) detected Tsap6
proteins of 46 and 52 kD in mouse NIH3T3 cells, and they showed that the
larger protein resulted from glycosylation. Confocal microscopy of mouse
embryonic fibroblasts showed colocalization of endogenous Tsap6 with the
trans-Golgi network maker Tgn38 (TGOLN; 603062). Punctuated cytoplasmic
and plasma membrane staining of Tsap6 partially colocalized with
transferrin receptor (TFRC; 190010) and Eea1 (605070), suggesting that
Tsap6 is expressed in the endosomal compartment.

MAPPING

By FISH, Passer et al. (2003) mapped the STEAP3 gene to chromosome
2q14.2. They mapped the mouse Steap3 gene to chromosome 1.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Northern blot analysis, Passer et al. (2003) found that p53 (TP53;
191170) upregulated TSAP6 expression in mouse and human cell lines. They
identified a p53-responsive element upstream of the first exon of the
mouse Tsap6 gene. TSAP6 antisense cDNA decreased the level of
p53-induced apoptosis, and TSAP6 small interfering RNA inhibited
apoptosis in TSAP6-overexpressing cells. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis,
protein pull-down assays, and coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed
that TSAP6 interacted with NIX (BNIP3; 605368), a proapoptotic BCL2
(151430)-related protein, and with MYT1 kinase (602474), a negative
regulator of G2/M transition. Moreover, TSAP6 enhanced the
susceptibility of cells to apoptosis and cooperated with NIX to
exacerbate this effect. Cell cycle studies indicated that TSAP6 could
augment MYT1 activity. Passer et al. (2003) concluded that TSAP6 may act
downstream of p53 to interface apoptosis and cell cycle progression.

Histamine-releasing factor (TPT1; 600763) is a secreted protein that
participates in inflammatory responses by promoting the release of
histamine. Amzallag et al. (2004) found that secretion of TPT1 proceeded
by a nonclassical pathway independent of the endoplasmic reticulum and
Golgi apparatus. They determined that TSAP6 interacted with TPT1 in
several protein interaction assays, and the 2 proteins codistributed to
small vesicles called exosomes at the plasma membrane and around the
nucleus in several human cell lines. Overexpression of TSAP6 increased
the level of TPT1 in exosome preparations and consistently enhanced TPT1
secretion. Amzallag et al. (2004) concluded that TSAP6 has a role in the
export of TPT1 via a nonclassical pathway and suggested that TSAP6 may
have a general role in the regulation of vesicular trafficking and
secretion.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 sibs with hypochromic microcytic anemia and iron overload (615234),
born of nonconsanguineous Pakistani parents, Grandchamp et al. (2011)
analyzed 7 candidate genes and identified heterozygosity for a nonsense
mutation in the STEAP3 gene (C100X; 609671.0001) that was inherited from
their unaffected father. Quantitative analysis of mRNA levels suggested
that the father was heterozygous with 1 null allele and 1 normal, highly
expressed allele, whereas their unaffected mother had 2 weakly expressed
alleles, and each affected offspring had inherited the mutated allele
from their father and 1 of the weakly expressed alleles from their
mother. Using two 3-prime common polymorphisms in high linkage
disequilibrium as markers to perform quantitative sequencing of cDNA
from the blood of 20 control individuals, Grandchamp et al. (2011)
demonstrated a 2.5-fold variation in the C/T and A/C ratios among 17
individuals informative for dbSNP rs6753006 and 12 individuals
informative for dbSNP rs3731603, respectively, thus confirming
variability of STEAP3 expression in the general population.

ANIMAL MODEL

The reduction of iron is an essential step in the transferrin (TF;
190000) cycle, which is the dominant pathway for iron uptake by red
blood cell precursors. A deficiency in iron acquisition by red blood
cells leads to hypochromic, microcytic anemia. Using a positional
cloning strategy, Ohgami et al. (2005) identified the Steap3 gene as
responsible for the iron deficiency anemia in the mouse mutant nm1054.
They showed that Steap3 is expressed highly in hematopoietic tissues,
colocalizes with the transferrin cycle endosome, and facilitates
transferrin-bound iron uptake. Overexpression of Steap3 stimulated the
reduction of iron, and mice lacking Steap3 were deficient in erythroid
ferrireductase activity. These findings taken together were interpreted
as indicating that Steap3 is an endosomal ferrireductase required for
efficient transferrin-dependent iron uptake in erythroid cells.

Lespagnol et al. (2008) generated Tsap6 -/- mice and found that Tsap6
-/- splenocytes accumulated Tctp (TPT1) and Tfrc. Spleens of Tsap6 -/-
mice were enlarged with altered splenic architecture on histopathologic
analysis, and reticulocytes and erythrocytes were small and abnormally
shaped, consistent with microcytic anemia. Analysis of reticulocyte
maturation revealed a delay in Tfrc expulsion and reduced secretion of
exosomes. Induction of p53-mediated apoptosis, but not of p53- dependent
p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) expression, was attenuated in Tsap6 -/- spleen.
Following activation of p53 by DNA damage, Tsap6 -/- cells exhibited a
significant reduction in exosome secretion and an absence of exosomal
protein upregulation compared with wildtype controls. Lespagnol et al.
(2008) concluded that increased p53-mediated secretion of exosomes
following DNA damage is dependent on TSAP6 and that TSAP6 is needed to
expel proteins no longer required by cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ANEMIA, HYPOCHROMIC MICROCYTIC, WITH IRON OVERLOAD 2 (1 family)
STEAP3, CYS100TER

In 3 sibs with hypochromic microcytic anemia and iron overload (615234),
born of nonconsanguineous Pakistani parents, Grandchamp et al. (2011)
identified heterozygosity for a c.300C-A transition in exon 3 of the
STEAP3 gene, resulting in a cys100-to-ter (C100X) substitution. The
mutation was inherited from their unaffected father and was not found in
their unaffected mother or 200 control chromosomes. Quantitative RT-PCR
from blood mRNA of all 5 family members and 10 controls showed that the
STEAP3 mRNA level was considerably lower in the 3 patients, whereas both
parents had a level of STEAP3 mRNA corresponding to the low-normal range
found in controls. In B lymphocyte-cell lines treated to prevent
degradation due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, quantitative sequencing
of a cDNA fragment encompassing the mutated nucleotide demonstrated that
expression of the normal allele relative to that of the mutated allele
was significantly higher in the father than in the 3 sibs. Grandchamp et
al. (2011) suggested that the father was heterozygous with 1 null allele
and 1 normal, highly expressed allele, whereas the mother had 2 weakly
expressed alleles, and each affected offspring had inherited the mutated
allele from their father and 1 of the weakly expressed alleles from
their mother. This was supported by the fact that expression of both
alleles from the mother produced an amount of mRNA that was roughly
equivalent to the expression products from the single normal allele of
the father.

609516	TITLE *609516 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 382; ZNF382
;;KRAB/ZINC FINGER SUPPRESSOR PROTEIN 1, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; KS1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor family, such as
ZNF382, play key roles in the regulation of cell proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis in response to a variety of stimuli
(Gebelein et al., 1998).

CLONING

Gebelein et al. (1998) cloned rat Znf382, which they called Ks1.
Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of Ks1, with
highest levels in lung, kidney, and testis. Immunofluorescence
localization detected epitope-tagged Ks1 in the nucleus following
transfection of a human pancreatic cell line.

By screening a fetal heart cDNA library using PCR primers designed to
amplify KRAB domain-encoding sequences, followed by EST database
analysis and RACE of fetal heart RNA, Luo et al. (2002) cloned ZNF382.
The deduced 548-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
about 64 kD. ZNF382 contains N-terminal KRAB A and KRAB B domains,
followed by a vestigial zinc finger, a nuclear localization signal, and
9 tandemly repeated Kruppel-type C2H2-zinc finger domains at its C
terminus. ZNF382 shares 91% and 83% amino acid identity with rat Ks1 in
the KRAB and zinc finger domains, respectively. Northern blot analysis
detected a 2.9-kb transcript abundantly expressed in heart. Weaker
expression was detected in skeletal muscle, but no expression was
detected in 6 other tissues examined. Expression of ZNF382 was more
widespread in human fetal tissues. Whole 34- and 40-day embryos showed
high ZNF382 expression. At later developmental stages, ZNF382 was
detected predominantly in cerebellum, kidney, and cerebrum, and to a
lesser extent in lung, heart, skeletal muscle, tongue, and adrenal
gland.

GENE FUNCTION

By biochemical analysis, Gebelein et al. (1998) determined that rat Ks1
contains 2 transcriptional repressor domains, R1 and R2. R1 corresponds
to the KRAB A motif, and R2 is located immediately after the KRAB B
motif. Expression of rat Ks1 in a mouse fibroblast line suppressed
neoplastic transformation mediated by Hras (190020) and other potent
oncogenes. Deletion analysis indicated that R2 was required to suppress
transformation.

Using a random oligonucleotide-binding assay, Gebelein and Urrutia
(2001) identified a 27-bp rat Ks1-binding element (KBE). Deletion and
site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the 9 C-terminal zinc fingers
and the KRAB domain of Ks1 were required for transcriptional repression
through the KBE site. The KRAB domain of Ks1 interacted with the KAP1
(TRIM28; 601742) corepressor, and mutations that abolished this
interaction alleviated Ks1-mediated transcriptional repression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Luo et al. (2002) determined that the ZNF382 gene contains 5 exons and
spans about 23 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Luo et al. (2002) mapped the ZNF382 gene
to chromosome 19q13.13.

610635	TITLE *610635 COLLAGEN TRIPLE-HELIX REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; CTHRC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CTHRC1 is specifically expressed in vascular calcifications of carotid
artery lesions and may contribute to vascular remodeling of injured
arteries (Pyagay et al., 2005).

CLONING

By suppressive subtractive hybridization to identify genes
preferentially expressed in balloon-injured rat arteries, Pyagay et al.
(2005) cloned Cthrc1. Using 5-prime RACE, they cloned human CTHRC1 from
smooth muscle cell RNA. The deduced 243-amino acid human protein has an
N-terminal signal peptide and a short collagen (see COL1A1; 120150)
domain containing gly-X-Y repeats. Northern blot analysis revealed
Cthrc1 expression in rat lung and brain, with much lower levels in other
tissues examined. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry
localized rat Cthrc1 mRNA and protein to blood vessel adventitia at 8
and 14 days after balloon injury, with lower levels in developing
neointima. Significantly less Cthrc1 mRNA expression was detected 4
weeks after injury. Rat Cthrc1 protein was not detected in normal
arteries. Immunohistochemistry of human carotid artery lesion
endarterectomy samples detected CTHRC1 in vascular calcifications,
particularly at the outer margins of the calcification fronts, and in
chondrocyte-like cells surrounding the calcified tissue. Human CTHR1 was
not detected in noncalcified plaque regions.

GENE FUNCTION

By SDS-PAGE, glycosidase treatment, and collagenase analysis, Pyagay et
al. (2005) found that in vitro translated rat Cthrc1 was glycosylated
and formed a trimer, rendering it susceptible to cleavage by collagenase
(see 120353). Endogenous Cthrc1 mRNA levels increased in NIH3T3 mouse
fibroblasts following stimulation with BMP4 (112262) or TGFB1 (190180).
Scratch wound assays using Cthrc1-overexpressing rat smooth muscle cells
and mouse primary embryonic fibroblasts showed that Cthrc1 promoted cell
migration.

Yamamoto et al. (2008) found that Cthrc1 -/- mice appeared normal and
were fertile, but Cthrc1 -/- Vangl2 (600533) +/- mice displayed defects
in planar cell polarity comparable to those in Vangl2 -/- mice,
including midbrain neural tube closure defects and misorientation of
cochlear sensory hair cells. Since planar cell polarity requires Wnt
signaling, Yamamoto et al. (2008) examined interaction of mouse Cthrc1
with several components of the Wnt signaling pathway in transfected
HEK293T cells. They found that cell surface-anchored Cthrc1 bound to
specific Wnt proteins (e.g., WNT3A; 606359), Fzd proteins (e.g., FZD3;
606143), and Ror2 (602337), and that Cthrc1 enhanced the interaction of
Wnt proteins with Fzd-Ror2 by forming the Cthrc1-Wnt-Fzd-Ror2 complex.
Consistent with these findings, Ror2 -/- mice also showed planar cell
polarity-related abnormalities in the inner ear. Yamamoto et al. (2008)
concluded that CTHRC1 is a Wnt cofactor that selectively activates the
Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway by stabilizing ligand-receptor
interaction.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CTHRC1
gene to chromosome 8 (TMAP RH102528).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Orloff et al. (2011) identified a germline gln44-to-pro (Q44P;
610635.0001) mutation in the CTHRC1 gene in 1 (1.1%) of 116 patients of
European descent with Barrett esophagus and/or esophageal adenocarcinoma
(614266). The mutation was not found in 125 controls. The same mutation
was found in 1 (1.7%) of 58 independent cases in a replication study.
This genomic region was studied after being identified by genomewide
linkage analysis of 21 concordant and 11 discordant sib pairs with the
disorder. Orloff et al. (2011) suggested that variation in the CTHRC1

gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD; 109350).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BARRETT ESOPHAGUS/ESOPHAGEAL ADENOCARCINOMA
CTHRC1, GLN44PRO

Orloff et al. (2011) identified a germline 131A-C transversion in exon 1
of the CTHRC1 gene, resulting in a gln44-to-pro (Q44P) substitution, in
1 (1.1%) of 116 patients of European descent with Barrett esophagus
and/or esophageal adenocarcinoma (614266). The mutation was not found in
125 controls. The same mutation was found in 1 (1.7%) of 58 independent
cases in a replication study. This genomic region was studied after
being identified by genomewide linkage analysis of 21 concordant and 11
discordant sib pairs with the disorders. Orloff et al. (2011) suggested
that variation in the CTHRC1 gene may be important in the host tissue
repair response to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

600355	TITLE *600355 NEURONAL APOPTOSIS INHIBITORY PROTEIN; NAIP
;;BACULOVIRAL IAP REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; BIRC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In a search for the gene causing spinal muscular atrophy (SMA; 253300),
Roy et al. (1995) isolated a gene on chromosome 5q13.1, of which the
first 2 coding exons were deleted in approximately 67% of type I SMA
chromosomes compared with 2% of non-SMA chromosomes. One model of SMA
pathogenesis invokes an inappropriate persistence of motor neuron
apoptosis, which is a normally occurring phenomenon in development.
Consistent with this hypothesis, the novel gene was labeled 'neuronal
apoptosis inhibitory protein' (NAIP) and its function was supported by
the finding that it contains domains with sequence similarity to IAPs,
baculovirus proteins that inhibit virally induced insect cell apoptosis.
The presence of a variable number of copies of truncated and internally
deleted versions of the NAIP gene (pseudogenes) was thought to be a
possible factor in the genesis of SMA. This situation was compared to
that of the genes on 6p that code for steroid 21-hydroxylase (CYP21)
deficiency (201910); through the processes of unequal crossing-over or
gene conversion, mutations in the functional CYP21 gene (613815) can
result. Roy et al. (1995) raised the possibility that NAIP functions in
concert with SMN (600354) mutations in causing spinal muscular atrophy.

GENE FUNCTION

Liston et al. (1996) demonstrated that expression of NAIP in mammalian
cells inhibits apoptosis induced by a variety of signals.

NAIP, HIAP1 (601721), HIAP2 (601712), XIAP (300079), BIRC5 (603352), and
BIRC6 (605638) are members of the mammalian inhibitors of apoptosis
family and contain an N-terminal domain with 1 to 3 imperfect repeats of
an approximately 65-amino acid domain named the baculovirus IAP repeat
(BIR) motif. Gotz et al. (2000) identified 6 mouse Naip genes which were
expressed in a broad range of tissues. Using a neurite outgrowth assay
in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, they observed that Naip
overexpression impaired nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite
outgrowth. The BIR motifs of Naip (residues 1-345) were not required for
this effect. However, the BIR domains of Naip were essential to prevent
apoptosis in PC12 cells after NGF deprivation or tumor necrosis
factor-alpha receptor (TNFAR; 191190) stimulation. Expression of
full-length but not BIR-deleted Naip protected against cell death. This
correlated with reduced activity of the cell death effector protease,
caspase-3 (600636), in lysates of Naip-PC12 cells. The authors
hypothesized that dysregulation of cellular differentiation and/or
caspase suppression may contribute to motoneuron dysfunction and cell
death in spinal muscular atrophy where NAIP is mutated.

Kofoed and Vance (2011) showed in mice that different NAIP paralogs
determine the specificity of the NLRC4 (606831) inflammasome for
distinct bacterial ligands. In particular, they found that activation of
endogenous NLRC4 by bacterial PrgJ requires NAIP2, a previously
uncharacterized member of the NAIP gene family, whereas NAIP5 and NAIP6
activate NLRC4 specifically in response to bacterial flagellin. Kofoed
and Vance (2011) dissected the biochemical mechanism underlying the
requirement for NAIP proteins by use of a reconstituted NLRC4
inflammasome system. They found that NAIP proteins control
ligand-dependent oligomerization of NLRC4 and that the NAIP2-NLRC4
complex physically associates with PrgJ but not flagellin, whereas
NAIP5-NLRC4 associates with flagellin but not PrgJ. Kofoed and Vance
(2011) concluded that their results identified NAIPs as immune sensor
proteins in the mouse and provided biochemical evidence for a simple
receptor-ligand model for activation of the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasomes.

Zhao et al. (2011) showed that NAIP5, required for Legionella
pneumophila replication in mouse macrophages, is a universal component
of the flagellin-NLCR4 pathway. NAIP5 directly and specifically
interacted with flagellin, which determined the inflammasome stimulation
activities of different bacterial flagellins. NAIP5 engagement by
flagellin promoted a physical NAIP5-NLRC4 association, rendering full
reconstitution of a flagellin-responsive NLRC4 inflammasome in
nonmacrophage cells. The related NAIP2 functioned analogously to NAIP5,
serving as a specific inflammasome receptor for type III secretion
system (TTSS) rod proteins such as Salmonella PrgJ and Burkholderia
BsaK. Genetic analysis of Chromobacterium violaceum infection revealed
that the TTSS needle protein Cpr1 can stimulate NLRC4 inflammasome
activation in human macrophages. Similarly, Cpr1 is specifically
recognized by human NAIP, the sole NAIP family member in human. The
finding that NAIP proteins are inflammasome receptors for bacterial
flagellin and TTSS apparatus components further predicted that the
remaining NAIP family members may recognize other microbial products to
activate NLRC4 inflammasome-mediated innate immunity.

To identify CASP1 (147678) functions in vivo, von Moltke et al. (2012)
devised a strategy for cytosolic delivery of bacterial flagellin, a
specific ligand for the NAIP5/NLRC4 inflammasome. Von Moltke et al.
(2012) showed that systemic inflammasome activation by flagellin leads
to a loss of vascular fluid into the intestine and peritoneal cavity,
resulting in rapid (less than 30 minutes) death in mice. This unexpected
response depends on the inflammasome components NAIP5, NLRC4, and CASP1,
but is independent of the production of IL1-beta (147720) or IL18
(600953). Instead, inflammasome activation results, within minutes, in
an 'eicosanoid storm'--a pathologic release of signaling lipids,
including prostaglandins and leukotrienes, that rapidly initiate
inflammation and vascular fluid loss. Mice deficient in cyclooxygenase-1
(COX1, PTGS1; 176805), a critical enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis,
are resistant to these rapid pathologic effects of systemic inflammasome
activation by either flagellin or anthrax lethal toxin.
Inflammasome-dependent biosynthesis of eicosanoids is mediated by the
activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (see 172410) in resident
peritoneal macrophages, which are specifically primed for the production
of eicosanoids by high expression of eicosanoid biosynthetic enzymes.
Von Moltke et al. (2012) concluded that their results identified
eicosanoids as a previously unrecognized cell type-specific signaling
output of the inflammasome with marked physiologic consequences in vivo.

MAPPING

Roy et al. (1995) mapped the NAIP gene to chromosome 5q13.1. DiDonato et
al. (1997) mapped the mouse homolog of NAIP to chromosome 13 in a region
showing conserved synteny with human 5q13.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Although NAIP deletions are more frequently observed in patients
affected by the acute form of SMA, it is not possible to establish an
unambiguous correlation between deletion size and clinical severity.
Novelli et al. (1997) investigated the effects of gender on the
association between NAIP gene deletion and disease severity. No
significant relationship between deletion size and clinical phenotype
was observed among male patients, whereas in females the absence of NAIP
was strongly associated with a severe phenotype (p less than 0.0001).
SMA I was found in 75.6% of females and only 52.5% of males lacking
NAIP. These results provided a possible molecular explanation for the
sex-dependent phenotypic variation observed in SMA patients.

ANIMAL MODEL

In inbred mouse strains, permissiveness to intracellular replication of
Legionella pneumophila is controlled by a single locus (Lgn1), which
maps to a region within distal chromosome 13 that contains multiple
copies of the Birc1 gene. Genomic BAC clones from the critical interval
were transferred into transgenic mice to complement functionally the
Lgn1-associated susceptibility of A/J mice to L. pneumophila. Diez et
al. (2003) found that 2 independent BAC clones that rescued
susceptibility had an overlapping region of 56 kb in which the entire
Lgn1 transcript must lie. The full-length transcript of Birc1e (also
called Naip5) is coded in this region. The results indicated a role for
Birc1e in macrophage resistance to L. pneumophila infection. BIRC1
proteins are members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family,
structurally defined by baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis repeat (BIR)
domains implicated in protein-protein interactions. An antiapoptotic
effect of BIRC1 has been described. Induction of apoptosis seems to be
important for pathogenesis of L. pneumophila in human macrophages in
vitro.

Zamboni et al. (2006) noted that there are 14 amino acid differences in
Birc1e between A/J and C57Bl/6 mice. A/J macrophages permit more L.
pneumophila replication than C57Bl/6 macrophages. Zamboni et al. (2006)
found that Birc1e-expressing cells from C57Bl/6 mice, but not those from
A/J mice, responded to L. pneumophila infection and delivery of
bacterial molecules to the cytosol with Casp1 (147678)-dependent cell
death. Mutation analysis showed that the leucine-rich region of Birc1e
regulated Birc1e activation, Casp1 activation, and Il1b (147720)
secretion and required Ipaf (CARD12; 606831). Zamboni et al. (2006)
concluded that Birc1e is a nucleotide-binding
oligomerization-leucine-rich repeat protein involved in detection and
control of intracellular L. pneumophila.

607927	TITLE *607927 ANKYRIN REPEATS- AND FYVE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; ANKFY1
;;ANKYRIN REPEATS HOOKED TO A ZINC FINGER MOTIF; ANKHZN;;
KIAA1255
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ANKFY1 contains several protein-interacting domains and shares
significant identity with a number of S. cerevisiae proteins involved in
vesicular trafficking (Kuriyama et al., 2000).

CLONING

Ito et al. (1999) cloned mouse Ankfy1, which they designated Ankhzn. The
deduced 1,184-amino acid protein has an apparent molecular mass of 130
kD. Ankhzn contains an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, a BTB/POZ domain,
17 ankyrin repeats, and a C-terminal zinc finger motif. The ankyrin
repeats are separated into a group of 4 repeats in the N-terminal half
and a group of 13 repeats in the C-terminal half. Ito et al. (1999)
determined that there is a soluble form of Ankhzn and a form that
associates with endosomes.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned ANKFY1, which they designated
KIAA1255. The deduced protein shares 88% identity with mouse Ankhzn.
RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression in whole adult brain and
intermediate expression in all other tissues and specific brain regions
examined, including fetal brain.

By searching databases for sequences sharing homology with mouse Ankhzn,
followed by PCR, Kuriyama et al. (2000) cloned ANKHZN from a fetal brain
cDNA library. The deduced 1,166 amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of about 128 kD. ANKHZN shares 85% identity with mouse
Ankhzn, and the 2 proteins have the same domain structure. Kuriyama et
al. (2000) noted that the C-terminal zinc finger (FYVE) domain, which
contains 8 potential Zn(2+)-coordinating cysteine residues that bind 2
Zn(2+) ions, is well conserved among proteins related to intracellular
trafficking. Northern blot analysis detected a 7-kb transcript in both
human and mouse brain. RT-PCR detected expression in all tissues
examined. Subcellular fractionation of human kidney recovered ANKHZN in
both the soluble and membrane fractions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kuriyama et al. (2000) determined that the ANKFY1 gene contains 25
exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the ANKFY1
gene to chromosome 17. By radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Kuriyama
et al. (2000) mapped the ANKFY1 gene to chromosome 17p13. Southern blot
analysis indicated that ANKFY1 is a single-copy gene.

300637	TITLE *300637 G ANTIGEN 12I; GAGE12I
;;GAGE7B
DESCRIPTION See GAGE1 (300594) for more information about the GAGE gene cluster.

CLONING

By screening a melanoma cell cDNA library with GAGE1 (300594) as probe,
De Backer et al. (1999) cloned GAGE12I, which they called GAGE7B. GAGE7B
differs from GAGE7 (300601) cloned by Chen et al. (1998) by only a
single nucleotide and encodes the same putative 117-amino acid protein.

GENE FUNCTION

De Backer et al. (1999) showed that expression of GAGE7B was induced
after treatment of peripheral blood leukocytes with phytohemagglutinin.

GENE STRUCTURE

De Backer et al. (1999) determined that the GAGE7B gene contains 5
exons. The first exon is noncoding, and intron 4 contains a LINE
insertion, which disrupts a putative exon comparable to exon 4-prime in
the GAGE1 gene.

Gjerstorff and Ditzel (2008) stated that the GAGE12I gene is contained
within a 9.5-kb GAGE repeat and the 5 exons of GAGE12I span about 6.3
kb.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, De Backer et al. (1999) mapped
the GAGE7B gene to chromosome Xp11.4-p11.2.

By genomic sequence analysis, Gjerstorff and Ditzel (2008) mapped the
GAGE12I gene to a GAGE gene cluster in chromosome Xp11.23.

610284	TITLE *610284 LIPOYLTRANSFERASE 1; LIPT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In mammals, lipoyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.181) catalyzes the second of 2
steps in the covalent attachment of lipoic acid to lipoate-dependent
proteins, including the glycine cleavage system H protein (GCSH; 238330)
and the dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2) subunits of the pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex (DLAT; 608770), the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
complex (DLST; 126063), and the branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase
complex (DBT; 248610) (Fujiwara et al., 1999).

CLONING

Using a bovine lipoyltransferase cDNA fragment as probe, Fujiwara et al.
(1999) cloned human LIPT1 from a liver cDNA library. The deduced
373-amino acid precursor protein shares 88% and 31% sequence identity
with bovine lipoyltransferase II and E. coli lipoate-protein ligase A,
respectively. By alignment of LIPT1 with the bovine lipoyltransferase
amino acid sequence, Fujiwara et al. (1999) predicted that the
N-terminal 26 amino acids comprise a mitochondrial targeting sequence,
with the threonine-27 corresponding to the first residue of the mature
enzyme. Thus, the deduced mature LIPT1 enzyme contains 347 amino acids
with a calculated molecular mass of 39.539 kD. Northern blot analysis
detected a major 1.5-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in skeletal muscle and heart, followed by liver, brain,
placenta, and lung.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fujiwara et al. (1999) determined that the LIPT1 gene contains 4 exons
and spans 8 kb of genomic DNA. They found evidence of several LIPT1
transcripts resulting from alternative splicing in the 5-prime
untranslated region.

MAPPING

By FISH, Fujiwara et al. (1999) mapped the LIPT1 gene to chromosome
2q11.2.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

SR proteins are required in pre-mRNA splicing. See, for example, 600812,
600813, 600572, 601944, 601945, and 600914. Zahler et al. (1993)
isolated a cDNA encoding a gene they designated human SRp75, which was
later identified as SFRS4. The apparent molecular mass of SRp75 is 75
kD; the phosphorylated SRp75 has a molecular mass of 57 kD. The authors
found that SRp75, like other SR proteins, contains an N-terminal RNA
recognition motif (RRM), a glycine-rich region, an internal region
homologous to the RRM, and a long 315-amino acid C-terminal
serine/arginine-rich domain. Zahler et al. (1993) found that purified
SRp75 protein can complement a splicing-deficient S100 extract.

GENE FUNCTION

Lareau et al. (2007) reported that in every member of the human SR
family of splicing regulators, highly or ultraconserved elements are
alternatively spliced, either as alternative 'poison cassette exons'
containing early in-frame stop codons, or as alternative introns in the
3-prime untranslated region. These alternative splicing events target
the resulting mRNAs for degradation by means of an RNA surveillance
pathway called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Mouse orthologs of the
human SR proteins exhibit the same unproductive splicing patterns.
Lareau et al. (2007) concluded that unproductive splicing is important
for regulation of the entire SR family and found that unproductive
splicing associated with conserved regions has arisen independently in
different SR genes, suggesting that splicing factors may readily acquire
this form of regulation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SFRS4
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SHGC-74500).

194526	TITLE *194526 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 34; ZNF34
;;KOX32
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

KOX32 is a 1.4-kb cDNA fragment of the ZNF34 zinc finger gene cloned
into the EcoRI site of a plasmid vector. La Pillo et al. (1993)
described a BanII RFLP in the ZNF34 gene.

MAPPING

Huebner et al. (1991) mapped the ZNF34 gene to chromosome 8q24, proximal
to MYC (190080) by somatic cell hybrid analysis and in situ chromosomal
hybridization. Since MYC is located in 8q24.12-q24.13 and both genes
were found to be intact in 2 patients with Langer-Giedion syndrome
(150230) and a deletion of 8q22.3-q24.11 and 8q23.3-q24.12,
respectively, La Pillo et al. (1993) concluded that ZNF34 is located in
8q24.12-q24.13.

164875	TITLE *164875 VAV1 ONCOGENE; VAV1
;;ONCOGENE VAV;;
ONCOGENE VAV1
DESCRIPTION The VAV oncogene was generated by genomic rearrangement that replaced
the 5-prime domain of the VAV protooncogene by sequences from a
bacterial gene present in the cotransfecting DNA used as a selectable
marker during gene transfer assay (Katzav et al., 1989). A high level of
expression of the VAV oncogene leads to morphologic transformation of
NIH 3T3 cells in culture and to the efficient induction of tumors in
immunocompromised mice. The VAV gene directs the synthesis of a 3.0-kb
transcript that is specifically expressed in cells of hematopoietic
origin, including those of erythroid, lymphoid, and myeloid lineages.
The predicted amino acid sequence of the gene product exhibits motifs
characteristic of transcriptional factors, including a highly acidic
amino-terminal region, separated from 2 putative nuclear localization
signals by a proline-rich sequence, and 2 zinc finger-like domains.

Bustelo and Barbacid (1992) presented results suggesting that the VAV
protooncogene participates in the signaling processes that mediate the
antigen-induced activation of B lymphocytes.

Fackler et al. (1999) identified the protooncogene and guanine
nucleotide exchange factor VAV as the specific binding partner of Nef
proteins from HIV-1. The interaction between Nef and VAV led to
increased activity of VAV and its downstream effectors. Both
cytoskeletal changes and the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (see
602896) were observed. Fackler et al. (1999) concluded that the
interaction between Nef and VAV initiates a signaling cascade that
changes structural and physiologic parameters in the infected cell.

By analysis of a rodent-human hybrid DNA panel and by chromosomal in
situ hybridization, Martinerie et al. (1990) assigned the VAV locus to
19p13.2-p12. VAV and INSR, the insulin receptor gene (147670), appeared
to be closely linked; INSR and VAV migrated together in high molecular
weight DNA fragments created with rare cutting restriction enzymes that
were subjected to pulsed field gel electrophoresis. It may be worth
noting that transcription factor-3 (147141), which has been implicated
in acute lymphoblastic leukemia associated with translocations (p1;19),
is located at 19p13.3-p13.2. By fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Trask et al. (1993) assigned the VAV gene to 19p13.3-p13.2.

Studies by Tarakhovsky et al. (1995), Zhang et al. (1995), and Fischer
et al. (1995) demonstrated functional consequences of VAV gene deletion.
The investigators used homologous recombination to introduce a null
mutation into embryonic stem (ES) cells. Tarakhovsky et al. (1995)
reported that in the absence of VAV antigen, receptor mediated
proliferative responses of B and T cells are severely reduced. Fischer
et al. (1995) demonstrated that VAV-dependent signaling pathways
regulate the maturation of T cells. The studies reported by Zhang et al.
(1995) confirmed that VAV plays a role in T- and B-cell development and
activation.

Using genomic sequence analysis, Denkinger et al. (2000) determined that
the VAV1 gene contains 27 exons and spans 77 kb on chromosome 19. Its
overall exon organization is similar to that of VAV2 (600428). They also
identified several differences from the original VAV cDNA sequence,
notably, that there is an isoleucine at position 718 rather than a
threonine, which changes the classification of the VAV SH2 domain from
type 3 to type 2. Promoter analysis indicated that a 23-bp segment that
includes a potential CBF/AML1 (see 151385)-binding site is essential for
VAV expression in a monocytoid cell line.

Moores et al. (2000) expressed VAV1, VAV2, and VAV3 (605541) at
equivalent levels and found that each responds to similar surface
receptor tyrosine kinases. Integrin-induced phosphorylation required the
presence of SYK (600085). Only VAV1 could efficiently cooperate with
T-cell receptor (TCR; see 186880) signaling to enhance NFAT
(600489)-dependent transcription, while only VAV1 and VAV3 could enhance
nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011)-dependent transcription.

Bustelo (2000) presented a comprehensive review of the regulatory and
signaling properties of the VAV family.

607494	TITLE *607494 INOSITOL POLYPHOSPHATE-4-PHOSPHATASE, TYPE II, 105-KD; INPP4B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

INPP4B is a Mg(2+)-independent phosphatase that catalyzes the hydrolysis
of the 4-position phosphate of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate,
inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, and inositol 3,4-bisphosphate.

CLONING

Norris et al. (1997) identified ESTs for INPP4B by homology with the rat
sequence and isolated clones from a human brain cDNA library. The
deduced 934-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about
105 kD. It contains an active site consensus sequence identified in
several other Mg(2+)-independent phosphatases. Unlike INPP4A (600916),
INPP4B does not have a PEST sequence. The human and rat proteins share
90% sequence identity. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous
expression, with primary transcripts of 9.5, 5.3, 3.9, and 2.9 kb.
Highest expression was detected in skeletal muscle and heart, with
intermediate levels in brain, placenta, and pancreas, and lowest levels
in liver, kidney, and lung. The 5.3-kb transcript was detected only in
brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Recombinant rat Inpp4b showed enzymatic properties similar to those
reported for human INPP4A. Inpp4b catalyzed the hydrolysis of
phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol
3-phosphate in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. It also
showed optimal activity between pH 7 and pH 8 and was inhibited by
inositol hexakisphosphate.

606575	TITLE *606575 MEMBRANE PROTEIN, PALMITOYLATED 4; MPP4
;;DISCS LARGE, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 6; DLG6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By expression profiling of retina-specific ESTs and RT-PCR of retinal
RNA, Stohr and Weber (2001) obtained a cDNA encoding MPP4. The predicted
637-amino acid MPP4 protein, which is 36% identical to MPP3 (601114) and
75% identical to its rat homolog, contains an N-terminal PDZ domain, a
central SH3 motif, and a C-terminal guanylate kinase (GUK)-like domain
typical of MAGUK (membrane-associated GUK) proteins. Northern blot and
RT-PCR analyses detected a 3.8-kb transcript expressed only in retina.
Stohr and Weber (2001) noted that tissue-restricted expression of a
MAGUK protein had not been reported previously.

By immunofluorescence analysis of mouse retina, Yang et al. (2007)
showed that Mpp4 localized to the synaptic layer of photoreceptors.
Immunoelectron microscopy showed that Mpp4 distributed primarily along
the plasma membrane of photoreceptor synaptic terminals.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Stohr and Weber (2001) determined that the
MPP4 gene contains 22 exons and spans at least 50 kb.

MAPPING

By BAC and sequence database analysis, Stohr and Weber (2001) mapped the
MPP4 gene to chromosome 2q31. They proposed that MPP4 represents a
candidate gene for retinal disease due to its colocalization with RP26,
a locus for autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (Bayes et al.,
1998).

ANIMAL MODEL

Aartsen et al. (2006) found that Mpp4 -/- mice were indistinguishable
from wildtype littermates and that they grew and bred normally. However,
histologic examination revealed sporadic photoreceptor displacement.
Light and electron microscopy of Mpp4 -/- retinas revealed no structural
differences at the outer limiting membrane or photoreceptor synapse.
Electroretinography revealed overtly normal retinal activity, and
scanning laser ophthalmology showed apparently normal overall structure
in Mpp4 -/- retinas. Mpp4 -/- retinas showed downregulation of Psd95
(DLG4; 602887) and mislocalization of both Psd95 and Veli3 (LIN7C;
612332) at the photoreceptor presynaptic membrane. Aartsen et al. (2006)
proposed that MPP4 may function as a recruitment factor to organize
signal transducers at the photoreceptor synapse.

Yang et al. (2007) found that Mpp4 -/- mice were viable, fertile, and
apparently healthy. However, Mpp4 -/- retinas showed abnormal
sensitivity to light flash. Histologic examination revealed that the
size, shape, and density of rod terminals and synaptic vesicles were
normal, but the height of synaptic ribbons was increased in Mpp4 -/-
mice under both dark- and light-adapted conditions, suggesting elevated
Ca(2+) concentrations. Western blot analysis showed reduced expression
of the rhodopsin (RHO; 180380)-deactivating proteins, rhodopsin kinase
(GRK1; 180381) and recoverin (RCV1; 179618). Mpp4 -/- retina also showed
increased expression of Serca2 (ATP2A2; 108740) and abnormal
localization of type-2 inositol trisphosphate receptor (ITPR2; 600144),
confirming altered Ca(2+) homeostasis. The retinal content of plasma
membrane Ca(2+) ATPases (PMCAs; see 108731) was unchanged, but
immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the localization of PMCAs at
the rod presynaptic plasma membrane was lost. Yang et al. (2007)
concluded that MPP4 has a role in the membrane localization of PMCAs and
in modulating Ca(2+) homeostasis and synaptic transmission in rod
photoreceptors.

137240	TITLE *137240 GASTRIC INHIBITORY POLYPEPTIDE; GIP
;;GLUCOSE-DEPENDENT INSULINOTROPIC POLYPEPTIDE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Gastric inhibitory polypeptide, also known as glucose-dependent
insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), is a 42-amino acid hormone that
stimulates insulin (INS; 176730) secretion in the presence of glucose.
Its sequence indicates that it is a member of a family of structurally
related hormones that includes secretin (182099), glucagon (138030),
vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP; 192320), and growth
hormone-releasing factor (GHRH; 139190) (summary by Takeda et al.,
1987).

CLONING

Takeda et al. (1987) isolated and sequenced cDNA clones encoding the
human GIP precursor from a human duodenal cDNA library. The predicted
amino acid sequence of the precursor indicates that GIP is derived by
proteolytic processing of a 153-residue precursor, preproGIP, which has
a predicted molecular mass of 17.1 kD. The GIP moiety is flanked by
polypeptide segments of 51 and 60 amino acids at its amino and carboxyl
termini, respectively. GIP is released from the precursor by processing
at single arginine residues present at each end of the GIP sequence.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNAs and by in situ
hybridization using a GIP cDNA, Fukushima et al. (1989) and Inagaki et
al. (1989) mapped the human GIP gene to chromosome 17q21.3-q22.

By genetic linkage studies using multiple DNA markers from the 17q12-q21
region, Anderson et al. (1993) placed GIP on the genetic map of the
region in a position distal to HOX2B (142961) and GP3A (173470). By
genetic mapping through CEPH reference families and by high-resolution
radiation hybrid mapping, Lewis et al. (1994) concluded that the GIP
gene is in a tight cluster in the following order:
cen--PPY--HOXB6--NGFR--GIP--NME1--tel. GIP was estimated to lie 250 kb
distal to NGFR (162010).

Mohlke et al. (1996) demonstrated that the Gip gene is located in the
distal portion of mouse chromosome 11, closely linked to Mvwf (see
111730) and between Ngfr and Hoxb9.

GENE FUNCTION

Cheung et al. (2000) found that gut K cells could be induced to produce
human insulin by providing the cells with the human INS gene linked to
the 5-prime regulatory region of the GIP gene. Mice expressing this
transgene produced human insulin specifically in gut K cells. This
insulin protected the mice from developing diabetes (see 222100) and
maintained glucose tolerance after destruction of the native
insulin-producing beta cells.

610571	TITLE *610571 FK506-BINDING PROTEIN 11; FKBP11
;;FK506-BINDING PROTEIN, 19-KD; FKBP19
DESCRIPTION For background information on FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), see FKBP1A
(186945).

CLONING

By searching databases for putative FKBPs, Rulten et al. (2006) obtained
a full-length cDNA encoding FKBP11, which they called FKBP19. The
deduced 201-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 22 kD.
It has an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by a peptidyl-prolyl
isomerase domain, a transmembrane region, and a lysine-rich C-terminal
tail containing a variant of the dilysine motif found in endoplasmic
reticulum membrane proteins. Northern blot analysis detected high
expression of an 800-bp transcript in pancreas, with low levels in all
other tissues examined. RNA dot blot analysis revealed ubiquitous FKBP11
expression, with highest levels in pancreas and other secretory tissues,
such as stomach, pituitary, salivary gland, and lymph node.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an in vitro binding assay, Rulten et al. (2006) showed that FKBP11
bound FK506 weakly.

GENE STRUCTURE

Patterson et al. (2002) determined that the FKBP11 gene has 6 coding
exons. Rulten et al. (2006) identified 5 NKX2-5 (NKX2E; 600584)-binding
sites and 4 PAX4 (167413)-binding sites upstream of the FKBP11 coding
region.

MAPPING

Rulten et al. (2006) stated that the FKBP11 gene maps to chromosome
12q13.
