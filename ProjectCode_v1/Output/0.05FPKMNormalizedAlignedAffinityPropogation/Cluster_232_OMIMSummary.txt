DESCRIPTION In studies in Drosophila, Xu et al. (1995) used mosaic flies to screen
for tumor suppressors or negative regulators of cell proliferation. The
cellular composition of these flies resembled that of cancer patients
who are chimeric individuals carrying a small number of mutated somatic
cells. One of the genes they identified was the 'large tumor suppressor'
gene, lats (also known as wts), which encodes a putative
serine/threonine kinase. Somatic cells mutant for lats undergo extensive
proliferation and form large tumors in many tissues in mosaic adults.
Mutants homozygous for various lats alleles display a range of
developmental defects, including embryonic lethality. Although many
tumor suppressors were identified in Drosophila melanogaster, it was not
clear whether these fly genes were directly relevant to tumorigenesis in
mammals.

Tao et al. (1999) isolated mammalian homologs of Drosophila lats. Human
LATS1 and mouse Lats1 share 99% amino acid sequence identity in the
C-terminal kinase domain; human LATS1 and fly lats share 74% amino acid
sequence identity in this region. Northern blot analysis detected LATS1
expression in all fetal and adult tissues examined, with highest
expression in adult ovary. Human LATS1 suppressed tumor growth and
rescued all developmental defects, including embryonic lethality, in
flies. In mammalian cells, LATS1 was phosphorylated in a cell
cycle-dependent manner and complexed with CDC2 (116940) in early
mitosis. These and other biochemical observations indicated that LATS1
is a novel negative regulator of CDC2/cyclin A.

To elucidate further the function of mammalian LATS1, St. John et al.
(1999) generated Lats1 -/- mice. The homozygous deficient animals
exhibited a lack of mammary gland development, infertility, and growth
retardation. Accompanying these defects were hyperplastic changes in the
pituitary and decreased serum hormone levels. The reproductive hormone
defects of the homozygous deficient mice were reminiscent of isolated
LH-hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and corpus luteum insufficiency in
humans. Furthermore, the Lats1 -/- mice developed soft-tissue sarcomas
and ovarian stromal cell tumors and were highly sensitive to
carcinogenic treatments. The data demonstrated a role for LATS1 in
mammalian tumorigenesis and specific endocrine dysfunction. The
significance of the findings of Tao et al. (1999) and St. John et al.
(1999) were discussed by Kemp (1999).
