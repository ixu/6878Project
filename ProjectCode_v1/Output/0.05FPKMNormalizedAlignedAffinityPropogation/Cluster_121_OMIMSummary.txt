607470	TITLE *607470 BREAST CARCINOMA AMPLIFIED SEQUENCE 3; BCAS3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a cDNA microarray-based analysis of genes amplified in breast
cancer cell lines, Barlund et al. (2002) identified BCAS3. They obtained
the full-length sequence from a liver cDNA library using several cloning
techniques. The deduced 913-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 99 kD. Northern blot analysis revealed a 3.9-kb
transcript expressed in all tissues examined. Several smaller
transcripts showed tissue-specific distribution. Multiple tissue
expression array analysis indicated ubiquitous expression, with highest
levels in stomach, liver, lung, kidney, fetal kidney, prostate, testis,
thyroid gland, and adrenal gland.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a functional genomic screen, Gururaj et al. (2006) identified
BCAS3 as a chromatin target of MTA1 (603526). MTA1 stimulation of BCAS3
transcription required estrogen receptor-1 (ESR1; 133430) and involved a
functional estrogen response element half-site in BCAS3. Furthermore,
MTA1 was acetylated on lys626, and this acetylation was necessary for
productive transcriptional recruitment of RNA polymerase II complex to
the BCAS3 enhancer sequence. BCAS3 expression was elevated in mammary
tumors from MTA1 transgenic mice and in 60% of human breast tumors, and
it correlated with coexpression of MTA1 as well as with tumor grade and
proliferation of primary breast tumor cultures.

GENE STRUCTURE

Barlund et al. (2002) determined that the BCAS3 gene contains 24 exons
and spans more than 600 kb, including an intron of nearly 300 kb between
exons 22 and 23.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Barlund et al. (2002) mapped the BCAS3
gene to chromosome 17q23.

CYTOGENETICS

Barlund et al. (2002) determined that a 1.3-kb transcript overexpressed
in the MCF7 breast carcinoma cell line resulted from a fusion between
the BCAS3 gene from chromosome 17 and the BCAS4 gene (607471) from
chromosome 20. Although amplification of either or both genes was common
in the 12 other breast cancer cell lines examined, no other cell line
expressed the fusion transcript.

601246	TITLE *601246 CHROMATIN ASSEMBLY FACTOR I, SUBUNIT A; CHAF1A
;;CHROMATIN ASSEMBLY FACTOR I, p150 SUBUNIT; CAF1P150;;
CAF1B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Chromatin assembly factor I (CAF1) is a nuclear complex consisting of
p50, p60 (CHAF1B; 601245), and p150 (CHAF1A) subunits that assembles
histone octamers onto replicating DNA in vitro (Kaufman et al., 1995).

CLONING

Kaufman et al. (1995) obtained a cDNA for the p150 CAF1 subunit by using
a combination of antibody screening of an expression library and partial
protein sequencing. The predicted 938-amino acid protein appears to be
highly charged and has an isoelectric point of 5.5. It has a PEST
(proline-glutamic acid-serine-threonine) box near the N terminus that is
associated with proteins of short half-lives.

GENE FUNCTION

Kaufman et al. (1995) found that the p150 and p60 CAF1 subunits
interacted with each other in nucleosome assembly, and deletion of the
p60-binding domain (amino acids 642 to 677) from p150 abolished
chromatin assembly. They also showed that p150 and p60 formed complexes
with newly synthesized histone H3 (see 601058) and acetylated histone H4
(see 602822), which may form an intermediate prior to assembly on
replicating DNA.

Murzina et al. (1999) demonstrated that CHAF1A binds to mouse
heterochromatin-binding protein-1 (Hp1; see 604478) via an N-terminal
domain. Mutations in CHAF1A prevented association with Hp1 in
heterochromatin in cells that were not in S phase and the formation of
CHAF1-Hp1 complexes in nascent chromatin during DNA replication in
vitro. These data suggested that CHAF1A has a heterochromatin-specific
function distinct from its nucleosome assembly function during S phase.
Just before mitosis, CHAF1A and some HP1 progressively dissociate from
heterochromatin concomitant with histone H3 phosphorylation. The HP1
proteins reassociate with chromatin at the end of mitosis, as histone H3
is dephosphorylated.

Using small interfering RNA, Hoek and Stillman (2003) found that
knockdown of CAF1 p150 in human cell lines resulted in cells that
accumulated in early and mid S phase and replicated DNA slowly. The
checkpoint kinase CHK1 (CHEK1; 603078), but not CHK2 (CHEK2; 604373),
was phosphorylated in response to CAF1 depletion, consistent with a DNA
replication defect. CAF1-depleted cell extracts completely lacked DNA
replication-coupled chromatin assembly activity. Hoek and Stillman
(2003) concluded that, in contrast to yeast, human CAF1 is necessary for
coupling chromatin assembly with DNA replication.

602844	TITLE *602844 RHO GDP-DISSOCIATION INHIBITOR GAMMA; ARHGDIG
;;RHOGDI-GAMMA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The GDP-dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) play a primary role in modulating
the activation of GTPases by inhibiting the exchange of GDP for GTP. See
ARHGDIB (602843).

CLONING

To identify additional GDIs for Rho-related proteins, Adra et al. (1997)
screened a brain library with cDNAs encoding 2 Rho GDIs, RhoGDI
(ARHGDIA; 601925) and GDID4 (ARHGDIB). They recovered a cDNA for a
protein that they designated RhoGDI-gamma. The sequence of the predicted
225-amino acid protein is approximately 50% identical to those of RhoGDI
and GDI/D4, and contains a hydrophobic amino terminus not seen in the
other proteins. In vitro, RhoGDI-gamma functioned as a GDI for CDC42
(116952), but with 20 times less efficiency than RhoGDI. Using
immunofluorescence of mammalian cells expressing RhoGDI-gamma, Adra et
al. (1997) found that the protein is distributed in a diffuse punctate
pattern in the cytoplasm and concentrated in vesicles in the perinuclear
area. Overexpression caused the cells to 'round up,' with loss of stress
fibers. Northern blot analysis revealed that RhoGDI-gamma is expressed
as 2.5- and 4.5-kb transcripts primarily in pancreas and brain.

611712	TITLE *611712 HOMEODOMAIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE 4; HIPK4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Arai et al. (2007) identified HIPK4 (homeodomain-interacting protein
kinase-4) by database analysis and cloned the full-length mouse Hipk4
ortholog. The deduced human and mouse proteins contain 616 amino acids
with a serine/threonine kinase domain in the N terminus and a PEST
domain in the C terminus. About 50% of the residues in the HIPK4
serine/threonine kinase domain are identical to those in other known
HIPK proteins (e.g., HIPK1, 608003). RT-PCR analysis of mouse tissues
showed moderate expression of Hipk4 in lung and white adipose tissue and
weak expression in brain and liver. Expression of human HIPK4 was also
seen in various cancer cell lines. Transient transfection experiments
with GFP-tagged HIPK4 in A549 and COS-1 cells demonstrated localization
throughout the cytoplasm and weakly in nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Arai et al. (2007) performed kinase assays using recombinant Hipk4
expressed in insect cells and found that Hipk4 has kinase activity
towards myelin basic protein (MBP; 159430) and histone H3 and is capable
of autophosphorylation. Arai et al. (2007) demonstrated that HIPK4 can
phosphorylate human p53 (191170) at the serine-9 position.
Overexpression of HIPK4 resulted in decreased activity of the survivin
(BIRC5; 603352) promoter, which is directly repressed by p53.

MAPPING

Scott (2007) mapped the HIPK4 gene to chromosome 19q13.2 based on an
alignment of the HIPK4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AC010271) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

DESCRIPTION See INE1 (300164). In a screen for genes that escape X inactivation,
Esposito et al. (1997) found 2 novel genes, INE1 and INE2. The INE2 cDNA
contained no significant open reading frame; however, a poly(A) signal
and polyadenylation were present. Northern blot analysis demonstrated a
2-kb mRNA in human adult brain. INE2 has no corresponding sequence on
the Y chromosome. Esposito et al. (1997) used fluorescence in situ

;;GLYCOPROTEIN I, BETA-2; B2GP1;;
GLYCOPROTEIN 1, BETA-2;;
BG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The APOH gene encodes beta-2 glycoprotein I, also known as
apolipoprotein H, a single-chain plasma protein of about 50 kD. Beta-2
GPI binds to and neutralizes negatively charged phospholipid
macromolecules, thereby diminishing inappropriate activation of the
intrinsic blood coagulation cascade. Beta-2 GPI has been implicated in a
variety of physiologic pathways, including blood coagulation,
hemostasis, and the production of antiphospholipid antibodies
characteristic of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS; 107320) (summary by
Mehdi et al., 2003).

CLONING

Lozier et al. (1984) determined the full amino acid sequence of
beta-2-glycoprotein (apoH). The deduced 326-amino acid protein contains
5 attached glucosamine-containing oligosaccharides. Computerized
analysis of the sequence revealed 5 consecutive homologous segments in
which cysteine, proline, and tryptophan appeared to be highly conserved.

Mehdi et al. (1991) cloned and sequenced APOH cDNAs from human liver and
from a human hepatoma cell line. Both cDNAs predicted a protein of 345
amino acids, including a 19-amino acid hydrophobic, N-terminal signal
sequence that is not present in the mature protein. The level of APOH
mRNA expressed by the hepatoma cells was downregulated by incubation
with inflammatory mediators, implying that APOH is a negative
acute-phase protein.

By Northern blot analysis, Steinkasserer et al. (1992) established that
APOH is synthesized in the liver where a transcript of approximately 1.5
kb was identified.

Sanghera et al. (2001) found that the chimpanzee APOH gene encodes a
deduced 326-amino acid protein, as in humans. The human and chimpanzee
APOH proteins share 99.4% sequence similarity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sheng et al. (1997) found that the mouse Apoh gene contains 8 exons and
spans approximately 18 kb.

Sanghera et al. (2001) found that the chimpanzee APOH gene, like the
human gene, contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

Haagerup et al. (1991) demonstrated RFLPs in the APOH gene and used
these in CEPH family studies to locate the gene on 17q. The marker that
showed closest linkage was HOX2 (142960), located at 17q21-q22; lod
score = 8.83 at theta = 0.05. Linkage to COL1A1 (120150) was indicated
by a lod score of 6.18 at theta = 0.12. By hybridizing a cDNA probe for
APOH to a panel of somatic cell hybrids, Steinkasserer et al. (1992)
showed that the structural locus maps to 17q23-qter.

Nonaka et al. (1992) mapped the mouse Apoh gene to chromosome 11. Nonaka
et al. (1992) commented that the mouse Apoh protein is composed of 5
repeating units called short consensus repeats (SCR), which are found
mostly in the regulatory proteins of the complement system.

GENE FUNCTION

Nakaya et al. (1980) demonstrated beta-2-glycoprotein I activation of
lipoprotein lipase and designated this glycoprotein as apolipoprotein H.

Lozier et al. (1984) noted that B2GI is associated with lipoproteins,
binds to platelets, interacts with heparin, and may be involved in blood
coagulation.

McNeil et al. (1990) identified beta-2-glycoprotein I as a cofactor
required for antiphospholipid antibodies (APA) to bind to cardiolipin.
These findings suggested that APA are directed against a complex antigen
that includes B2GPI. In addition, B2GPI bound to anionic phospholipids
in the absence of anticardiolipin antibodies. McNeil et al. (1990)
hypothesized that anticardiolipin APA may interfere with the function of
apoH in vivo, which may explain the association of these antibodies with
thrombotic tendencies.

Sanghera et al. (1997) noted that apoH had been implicated in a variety
of physiologic pathways including lipoprotein metabolism, coagulation,
and the production of antiphospholipid autoantibodies. They cited
reports supporting the conclusion that apoH is a required cofactor for
anionic phospholipid binding by the antiphospholipid autoantibodies
found in sera of many patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE;
152700) and primary antiphospholipid syndrome (107320), but it does not
seem to be required for the reactivity of antiphospholipid
autoantibodies associated with infections. These studies suggested that
the apoH-phospholipid complex forms the antigen to which the
autoantibodies are directed. Sanghera et al. (1997) postulated that
genetically determined structural abnormalities in the lipid-binding
domain(s) of apoH may affect its ability to bind lipid and consequently
the production of the autoantibodies.

Agar et al. (2010) used electron microscopy to demonstrate that B2GPI
exists in at least 2 different conformations: a closed circular plasma
conformation and an activated open conformation. The closed circular
conformation is maintained by interaction between the first (DI) and
fifth (DV) domains. In the activated open conformation, a cryptic
epitope in the first domain becomes exposed that enables antibodies to
bind and form an antibody-B2GPI complex. The open conformation prolonged
the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) when added to normal
plasma, and the APTT was further prolonged by addition of anti-B2GPI
antibodies, consistent with an anticoagulant effect. The conformations
could be converted into each other by changing pH and salt
concentrations.

In a review, Giannakopoulos et al. (2011) noted that B2GPI contains
multiple cysteine residues that mediate platelet and endothelial cell
adhesion via thiol exchange reactions. Evidence also suggests that B2GPI
may play a role in apoptosis by binding to blebs on apoptotic cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Richter and Cleve (1988) demonstrated genetic variation of APOH by means
of isoelectric focusing, and data on gene frequencies of allelic
variants were tabulated by Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

Using thin-layer polyacrylamide isoelectric focusing gels and
immunologic identification, Kamboh et al. (1988) demonstrated
genetically determined polymorphism of apolipoprotein H. Three common
alleles were identified in U.S. whites and blacks. A fourth allele was
observed in individuals of African descent. Family data confirmed
autosomal codominant inheritance of 4 alleles at a single APOH locus.

Sepehrnia et al. (1988) provided data on the distribution of
apolipoprotein polymorphisms in Nigeria, including polymorphism of APOH.
The observations supported the conclusion that the APOH*4 is a marker
allele unique to blacks and one that may be widely distributed among
African populations, whereas the APOH*1 allele may be a unique Caucasian
allele that was introduced into the black population of the U.S. by
admixture.

Eiberg et al. (1989) reported linkage data suggesting that the
structural and quantitative polymorphisms associated with serum
beta-2-glycoprotein I were very tightly linked (maximum lod score = 3.28
at theta = 0.0, male and female data combined). Sepehrnia et al. (1989)
found specific associations between particular APOH alleles and the
level of triglycerides in females.

In a population of black Africans from the Ivory Coast, Cleve et al.
(1992) found that the gene frequencies of APOH*1, APOH*2, APOH*3, and
APOH*4 were 0.012, 0.921, 0.047, and 0.020, respectively. In a tabular
review of reported frequencies in different populations, APOH*4 was
found only in individuals of African descent. The most common allele in
all populations, including African, Caucasian, European, and East Asian
descent, was APOH*2.

Among 661 non-Hispanic whites, Sanghera et al. (1997) found that the
frequency of the APOH*1, APOH*2, and APOH*3 alleles were 0.059, 0.868,
and 0.073, respectively. Sanghera et al. (1997) determined that the
APOH*1 allele is due to a ser88-to-asn (S88N) substitution in exon 3 of
the APOH gene. The frequency of the asn88 allele was 0.011, 0.043, and
0.056 in blacks, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites, respectively. Based
upon reactivity with a certain monoclonal apoH antibody, the APOH*3
allele could be subdivided into APOH*3(W) (reactive) and APOH*3(B)
(non-reactive). The APOH*3(W) allele was found to result from a
trp316-to-ser (W316S) substitution in the APOH gene. White had a
significantly higher frequency of APOH*3(W) (0.059) compared to blacks
(0.008).

Sanghera et al. (1997) found that the W316S substitution in the APOH
gene occurs in the fifth domain (domain V) of the protein, which affects
phospholipid binding. Another structural substitution in this domain,
cys306-to-gly (C306G), was also shown to disrupt binding of APOH to
phospholipid. These data indicated that domain V of APOH harbors the
lipid-binding region.

Among 455 non-Hispanic individuals, Mehdi et al. (1999) found that the
APOH*3(W) allele was associated with decreased plasma levels of apoH and
was estimated to account for about 10% of the phenotypic variation in
plasma levels in both men and women. However, Mehdi et al. (2003) found
that the W316S allele was in linkage disequilibrium with a promoter
polymorphism in the APOH gene, which explained the variation in plasma
apoH levels.

Hirose et al. (1999) found that the val247 allele (138700.0001) was
significantly associated with the presence of anti-B2GPI antibodies in
Asian patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS; 107320) in a study
of 370 healthy controls from different racial backgrounds and 149
patients with APS. The V allele and the VV genotype occurred most often
among Caucasians, less among African Americans, and least among Asians.
Conversely, the V allele and the VV genotype were found more frequently
among Asian patients with antiphospholipid syndrome than among controls
(p = 0.0028 and p = 0.0023, respectively). There were no significant
differences in allele or genotype frequencies when comparing Caucasian
or African American APS patients with appropriate controls. The
differences in allele and genotype frequencies seen in Asian APS
patients were restricted to those with anti-B2GPI antibodies.

HISTORY

Haupt et al. (1968) described a family in which 2 brothers had complete
absence of what they termed beta-2-glycoprotein I (Bg) in the serum.
Both parents, a sister, and both children of 1 of the brothers had
half-normal levels of the protein. Cleve and Rittner (1969) found 9
families out of 88 in which 1 parent and about half the children had
intermediate concentrations of beta-2-glycoprotein I, presumed to be
heterozygous for a deficiency ('null') gene.

Hoeg et al. (1985) observed the rare occurrence of total lack of
detectable apoH protein in less than 0.3% of clinic patients. A study of
family members of 5 such patients demonstrated autosomal codominant
inheritance pattern for plasma levels. The authors were impressed by the
lack of consistent effects on other plasma lipoproteins, and concluded
that the lack of apolipoprotein H does not result in a significant
perturbation of normal lipoprotein metabolism, suggesting that the
finding may not have clinical relevance.

Bancsi et al. (1992) concluded that deficiency of plasma B2GPI is not a
risk factor for thrombosis. In a comparison of healthy volunteers and 4
different groups of patients with familial thrombophilia, the prevalence
of B2GPI deficiency (plasma levels less than 77%) was found to be very
similar (6.8-12.5%) and not statistically significant between the
groups. One thrombophilic patient was found to be homozygous-deficient
for B2GPI and this transmission of the defect in his family followed
autosomal inheritance. However, 1 of his brothers was also
homozygous-deficient and was free of thromboembolic complications at the
age of 35 years.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting, Sanghera et al. (2001)
screened 155 chimpanzees (128 unrelated captured parents and 27
captive-born offspring) for the apoH protein polymorphism. The most
common IEF pattern in chimpanzees was identical to a previously
described APOH*3 allele in humans. In addition, they identified in
chimpanzees an allele designated APOH*4, resulting from a lys210-to-glu
missense change in exon 6. They found that the prevalence of anti-apoH
antibodies in chimpanzees (64%) was unusually high compared to that in
humans. No association was found between the lys210-to-glu mutation and
the occurrence of anti-apoH antibodies. The authors suggested that the
chimpanzee may serve as a useful animal model for human antiphospholipid
syndrome (107320).

Sheng et al. (2001) found that B2ghi-null mice were born at lower than
expected frequencies, suggesting that B2gpi may play a role in
implantation. However, B2gpi-null mice themselves did not show
reproductive abnormalities: the number of pregnancies, litter size, and
birth weight was similar to that of heterozygotes and controls.
B2gpi-null mice had no detectable organ pathology, and in vivo
coagulation profiles were also similar to controls. However, in vitro
studies of blood derived from the B2gpi-null mice showed less thrombin
generation compared to heterozygotes or controls.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
APOH POLYMORPHISM
APOH, VAL247LEU

Steinkasserer et al. (1993) described a 2-allele RsaI restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) in the APOH gene and demonstrated
that it led to a val247-to-leu (V247L) substitution. In studies of 34
unrelated parents in the CEPH family panel, allele frequencies were
found to be 0.76 for valine and 0.23 for leucine. The val-leu
polymorphism did not correlate with the 4 isoelectric focusing alleles
previously described.

600355	TITLE *600355 NEURONAL APOPTOSIS INHIBITORY PROTEIN; NAIP
;;BACULOVIRAL IAP REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; BIRC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In a search for the gene causing spinal muscular atrophy (SMA; 253300),
Roy et al. (1995) isolated a gene on chromosome 5q13.1, of which the
first 2 coding exons were deleted in approximately 67% of type I SMA
chromosomes compared with 2% of non-SMA chromosomes. One model of SMA
pathogenesis invokes an inappropriate persistence of motor neuron
apoptosis, which is a normally occurring phenomenon in development.
Consistent with this hypothesis, the novel gene was labeled 'neuronal
apoptosis inhibitory protein' (NAIP) and its function was supported by
the finding that it contains domains with sequence similarity to IAPs,
baculovirus proteins that inhibit virally induced insect cell apoptosis.
The presence of a variable number of copies of truncated and internally
deleted versions of the NAIP gene (pseudogenes) was thought to be a
possible factor in the genesis of SMA. This situation was compared to
that of the genes on 6p that code for steroid 21-hydroxylase (CYP21)
deficiency (201910); through the processes of unequal crossing-over or
gene conversion, mutations in the functional CYP21 gene (613815) can
result. Roy et al. (1995) raised the possibility that NAIP functions in
concert with SMN (600354) mutations in causing spinal muscular atrophy.

GENE FUNCTION

Liston et al. (1996) demonstrated that expression of NAIP in mammalian
cells inhibits apoptosis induced by a variety of signals.

NAIP, HIAP1 (601721), HIAP2 (601712), XIAP (300079), BIRC5 (603352), and
BIRC6 (605638) are members of the mammalian inhibitors of apoptosis
family and contain an N-terminal domain with 1 to 3 imperfect repeats of
an approximately 65-amino acid domain named the baculovirus IAP repeat
(BIR) motif. Gotz et al. (2000) identified 6 mouse Naip genes which were
expressed in a broad range of tissues. Using a neurite outgrowth assay
in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, they observed that Naip
overexpression impaired nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite
outgrowth. The BIR motifs of Naip (residues 1-345) were not required for
this effect. However, the BIR domains of Naip were essential to prevent
apoptosis in PC12 cells after NGF deprivation or tumor necrosis
factor-alpha receptor (TNFAR; 191190) stimulation. Expression of
full-length but not BIR-deleted Naip protected against cell death. This
correlated with reduced activity of the cell death effector protease,
caspase-3 (600636), in lysates of Naip-PC12 cells. The authors
hypothesized that dysregulation of cellular differentiation and/or
caspase suppression may contribute to motoneuron dysfunction and cell
death in spinal muscular atrophy where NAIP is mutated.

Kofoed and Vance (2011) showed in mice that different NAIP paralogs
determine the specificity of the NLRC4 (606831) inflammasome for
distinct bacterial ligands. In particular, they found that activation of
endogenous NLRC4 by bacterial PrgJ requires NAIP2, a previously
uncharacterized member of the NAIP gene family, whereas NAIP5 and NAIP6
activate NLRC4 specifically in response to bacterial flagellin. Kofoed
and Vance (2011) dissected the biochemical mechanism underlying the
requirement for NAIP proteins by use of a reconstituted NLRC4
inflammasome system. They found that NAIP proteins control
ligand-dependent oligomerization of NLRC4 and that the NAIP2-NLRC4
complex physically associates with PrgJ but not flagellin, whereas
NAIP5-NLRC4 associates with flagellin but not PrgJ. Kofoed and Vance
(2011) concluded that their results identified NAIPs as immune sensor
proteins in the mouse and provided biochemical evidence for a simple
receptor-ligand model for activation of the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasomes.

Zhao et al. (2011) showed that NAIP5, required for Legionella
pneumophila replication in mouse macrophages, is a universal component
of the flagellin-NLCR4 pathway. NAIP5 directly and specifically
interacted with flagellin, which determined the inflammasome stimulation
activities of different bacterial flagellins. NAIP5 engagement by
flagellin promoted a physical NAIP5-NLRC4 association, rendering full
reconstitution of a flagellin-responsive NLRC4 inflammasome in
nonmacrophage cells. The related NAIP2 functioned analogously to NAIP5,
serving as a specific inflammasome receptor for type III secretion
system (TTSS) rod proteins such as Salmonella PrgJ and Burkholderia
BsaK. Genetic analysis of Chromobacterium violaceum infection revealed
that the TTSS needle protein Cpr1 can stimulate NLRC4 inflammasome
activation in human macrophages. Similarly, Cpr1 is specifically
recognized by human NAIP, the sole NAIP family member in human. The
finding that NAIP proteins are inflammasome receptors for bacterial
flagellin and TTSS apparatus components further predicted that the
remaining NAIP family members may recognize other microbial products to
activate NLRC4 inflammasome-mediated innate immunity.

To identify CASP1 (147678) functions in vivo, von Moltke et al. (2012)
devised a strategy for cytosolic delivery of bacterial flagellin, a
specific ligand for the NAIP5/NLRC4 inflammasome. Von Moltke et al.
(2012) showed that systemic inflammasome activation by flagellin leads
to a loss of vascular fluid into the intestine and peritoneal cavity,
resulting in rapid (less than 30 minutes) death in mice. This unexpected
response depends on the inflammasome components NAIP5, NLRC4, and CASP1,
but is independent of the production of IL1-beta (147720) or IL18
(600953). Instead, inflammasome activation results, within minutes, in
an 'eicosanoid storm'--a pathologic release of signaling lipids,
including prostaglandins and leukotrienes, that rapidly initiate
inflammation and vascular fluid loss. Mice deficient in cyclooxygenase-1
(COX1, PTGS1; 176805), a critical enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis,
are resistant to these rapid pathologic effects of systemic inflammasome
activation by either flagellin or anthrax lethal toxin.
Inflammasome-dependent biosynthesis of eicosanoids is mediated by the
activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (see 172410) in resident
peritoneal macrophages, which are specifically primed for the production
of eicosanoids by high expression of eicosanoid biosynthetic enzymes.
Von Moltke et al. (2012) concluded that their results identified
eicosanoids as a previously unrecognized cell type-specific signaling
output of the inflammasome with marked physiologic consequences in vivo.

MAPPING

Roy et al. (1995) mapped the NAIP gene to chromosome 5q13.1. DiDonato et
al. (1997) mapped the mouse homolog of NAIP to chromosome 13 in a region
showing conserved synteny with human 5q13.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Although NAIP deletions are more frequently observed in patients
affected by the acute form of SMA, it is not possible to establish an
unambiguous correlation between deletion size and clinical severity.
Novelli et al. (1997) investigated the effects of gender on the
association between NAIP gene deletion and disease severity. No
significant relationship between deletion size and clinical phenotype
was observed among male patients, whereas in females the absence of NAIP
was strongly associated with a severe phenotype (p less than 0.0001).
SMA I was found in 75.6% of females and only 52.5% of males lacking
NAIP. These results provided a possible molecular explanation for the
sex-dependent phenotypic variation observed in SMA patients.

ANIMAL MODEL

In inbred mouse strains, permissiveness to intracellular replication of
Legionella pneumophila is controlled by a single locus (Lgn1), which
maps to a region within distal chromosome 13 that contains multiple
copies of the Birc1 gene. Genomic BAC clones from the critical interval
were transferred into transgenic mice to complement functionally the
Lgn1-associated susceptibility of A/J mice to L. pneumophila. Diez et
al. (2003) found that 2 independent BAC clones that rescued
susceptibility had an overlapping region of 56 kb in which the entire
Lgn1 transcript must lie. The full-length transcript of Birc1e (also
called Naip5) is coded in this region. The results indicated a role for
Birc1e in macrophage resistance to L. pneumophila infection. BIRC1
proteins are members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family,
structurally defined by baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis repeat (BIR)
domains implicated in protein-protein interactions. An antiapoptotic
effect of BIRC1 has been described. Induction of apoptosis seems to be
important for pathogenesis of L. pneumophila in human macrophages in
vitro.

Zamboni et al. (2006) noted that there are 14 amino acid differences in
Birc1e between A/J and C57Bl/6 mice. A/J macrophages permit more L.
pneumophila replication than C57Bl/6 macrophages. Zamboni et al. (2006)
found that Birc1e-expressing cells from C57Bl/6 mice, but not those from
A/J mice, responded to L. pneumophila infection and delivery of
bacterial molecules to the cytosol with Casp1 (147678)-dependent cell
death. Mutation analysis showed that the leucine-rich region of Birc1e
regulated Birc1e activation, Casp1 activation, and Il1b (147720)
secretion and required Ipaf (CARD12; 606831). Zamboni et al. (2006)
concluded that Birc1e is a nucleotide-binding
oligomerization-leucine-rich repeat protein involved in detection and
control of intracellular L. pneumophila.

605725	TITLE *605725 PERIAXIN; PRX
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PRX gene encodes 2 isoforms, L- and S-periaxin, which are structural
proteins mainly expressed by myelinating Schwann cells in the peripheral
nervous system. Periaxin interacts with the dystroglycan complex (see,
e.g., DAG1, 128239) via DRP2 (300052), thus linking the basal lamina to
the Schwann cell cytoskeleton (summary by Marchesi et al., 2010).

GENE STRUCTURE

Boerkoel et al. (2001) determined that the PRX gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH and electronic PCR (Schuler, 1997), Boerkoel et al. (2001)
mapped the PRX gene between D19S324 and D19S223 within a BAC on
19q13.1-q13.2, a position showing conserved synteny with mouse
chromosome 7 where the Prx gene maps (Gillespie et al., 1997).

GENE FUNCTION

The periaxin gene (PRX) encodes 2 PDZ-domain proteins, L- and
S-periaxin, that are required for maintenance of peripheral nerve myelin
(Dytrych et al., 1998). The PDZ domain, which consists of a nearly
90-amino acid protein-binding motif that interacts with the C termini of
plasma membrane proteins and with the cortical cytoskeleton, has been
implicated in the assembly of signaling complexes at sites of cell-cell
contact (Boerkoel et al., 2001).

Boerkoel et al. (2001) pointed out that the interactions among
L-periaxin, the cytoskeleton, and a membrane complex are reminiscent of
the interactions among the proteins of the dystrophin-sarcoglycan
complex (Cohn and Campbell, 2000) and the signaling complexes organized
by other PDZ domain proteins. They hypothesized that mutations in
cytoskeletal and membrane proteins interacting with L-periaxin may also
cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (see 118200) or related neuropathies.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Dejerine-Sottas Neuropathy

In 3 unrelated patients with Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy (145900) mapping
to chromosome 19q13.1-q13.2, Boerkoel et al. (2001) identified recessive
mutations in the PRX gene (605725.0001-605725.004).

- Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, Type 4F

In affected members of a Lebanese family with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease type 4F (CMT4F; 614895) reported by Delague et al. (2000),
Guilbot et al. (2001) identified a homozygous mutation in the PRX gene
(R196X; 605725.0005).

In 66 Japanese patients with demyelinating CMT in whom the causative
mutation had not been identified, Kijima et al. (2004) tested for
mutation in the PRX gene. Three unrelated patients were found to be
homozygous for an arg1070-to-ter mutation (R1070X; 605725.0008); they
presented with early onset and slowly progressive distal motor and
sensory neuropathy. Kijima et al. (2004) concluded that mutations
lacking the C-terminal acidic domain of PRX may show loss of function
effects and cause severe demyelinating CMT.

Marchesi et al. (2010) noted that all patients with neuropathy due to
PRX mutations had truncating mutations in homozygous or compound
heterozygous state, consistent with loss of protein function as a
disease mechanism.

Tokunaga et al. (2012) reported 3 unrelated Japanese patients with
adult-onset, slowly progressive CMT4F due to homozygous mutations in the
PRX gene (R1070X, 605725.0008 or D651N, 605725.0011). The report
expanded the phenotype associated with PRX mutations and identified the
first missense mutation in this gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Confirming the necessity of periaxin for maintenance of the myelin
sheath, Gillespie et al. (2000) demonstrated that Prx -/- mice ensheath
and myelinate peripheral axons apparently normally but subsequently
develop a severe demyelinating neuropathy associated with allodynia
(pain from non-noxious stimuli) and hyperalgesia (hypersensitivity to
pain). Sherman et al. (2001) found that L-periaxin interacted and
colocalized with dystrophin-related protein-2 (DRP2; 300052) within a
dystroglycan complex localized to the plasma membrane of Schwann cells.
In Prx-null mice, Sherman et al. (2001) found mislocalization and
concomitant loss of Drp2, suggesting that L-periaxin stabilizes the
Drp2-dystroglycan complex. Sherman et al. (2001) concluded that the
L-periaxin-Drp2-dystroglycan complex is important in regulating the
terminal stages of myelination.

Nerve impulses are propagated at nodes of Ranvier in the myelinated
nerves of vertebrates. Internodal distances have been proposed to affect
the velocity of nerve impulse conduction. Ramon y Cajal (1933) described
longitudinal and transverse bands of cytoplasm or trabeculae in
internodal Schwann cells and suggested that they had a nutritive
function. Court et al. (2004) showed that internodal growth in wildtype
nerves is precisely matched to nerve extension, but disruption of the
cytoplasmic bands in periaxin-null mice impairs Schwann cell elongation
during nerve growth. By contrast, myelination proceeds normally. The
capacity of wildtype and mutant Schwann cells to elongate is cell
autonomous, indicating that passive stretching can account for the
lengthening of the internode during limb growth. As predicted on
theoretical grounds, decreased internodal distances strikingly decrease
conduction velocities and so affect motor function. Court et al. (2004)
proposed that microtubule-based transport in the longitudinal bands of
Cajal permits internodal Schwann cells to lengthen in response to axonal
growth, thus ensuring rapid nerve impulse transmission.

DEJERINE-SOTTAS NEUROPATHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
PRX, ARG953TER

In affected members of a family with autosomal recessive Dejerine-Sottas
neuropathy (145900), Boerkoel et al. (2001) found compound
heterozygosity in the periaxin gene for a 2857C-T transition resulting
in an arg953-to-ter (R953X) substitution and a 1-bp deletion (2787delC)
resulting in a frameshift that terminates the protein at codon 957
(605725.0003). Markedly reduced nerve-conduction velocities and
onion-bulb formation were demonstrated. The patients had a more severe
sensory component than is usually seen in typical Dejerine-Sottas
neuropathy or CMT1 (see 118220).

.0002
DEJERINE-SOTTAS NEUROPATHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
PRX, 1-BP DEL, 2787C

In a patient with autosomal recessive Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy
(145900), Boerkoel et al. (2001) identified a 1-bp deletion in the PRX
gene (2787delC) in compound heterozygous state; see 605725.0001. They
identified the same mutation in homozygous state in a woman with
autosomal recessive Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy. The parents were
consanguineous; her son and 2 unaffected sisters were heterozygous for
the same 1-bp deletion.

DEJERINE-SOTTAS NEUROPATHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
PRX, ARG368TER

In a single case of autosomal recessive Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy
(145900), Boerkoel et al. (2001) found compound heterozygosity in the
PRX gene for a 1102C-T transition resulting in an arg368-to-ter
substitution and a 1-bp deletion (2289delT) resulting in a frameshift
that terminates the protein at codon 774 (605725.0004).

CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 4F
PRX, ARG196TER

In affected members of a large consanguineous Lebanese family with
autosomal recessive demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4F
(CMT4F; 614895) reported by Delague et al. (2000), Guilbot et al. (2001)
identified a homozygous 860C-T transition in exon 7 of the PRX gene
resulting in an arg196-to-ter nonsense mutation (R196X) which
cosegregated with the disorder. Histopathologic and immunohistochemical
analysis of a sural nerve biopsy of 1 patient revealed common features
with the mouse mutant and the absence of L-periaxin from the myelin
sheath. These data confirmed the importance of the periaxin proteins to
normal Schwann cell function.

.0006
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 4F
PRX, CYS715TER

In a brother and sister, born of unrelated parents, with CMT4F (614895),
Takashima et al. (2002) identified a homozygous cys715-to-ter (C715X)
substitution in the PRX gene. Sensory involvement was present and was
much worse than motor impairment. Despite early onset of disease, these
sibs had relatively slow disease progression and adult motor impairment.

.0007
DEJERINE-SOTTAS NEUROPATHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
PRX, 1-BP DEL, 247C

In a patient with Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy (145900), the offspring of
consanguineous parents, Takashima et al. (2002) found homozygosity for
deletion of 1 bp (247delC) in the PRX gene, resulting in a frameshift
and a stop codon at residue 96 (R82fsX96).

.0008
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 4F
PRX, ARG1070TER

In 3 unrelated Japanese patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type
4F (614895), Kijima et al. (2004) identified a homozygous 3208C-T
transition in the PRX gene, resulting in an arg1070-to-ter (R1070X)
mutation. The patients presented with early onset and slowly progressive
distal motor and sensory neuropathy. All 3 patients were born of
healthy, consanguineous parents. Two of the patients also had an
affected sib. On sural nerve biopsy, 1 patient had atypical onion bulb
formation, the second had more typical onion bulb formation, and the
third had onion bulb and tomacula formation.

Otagiri et al. (2006) reported a Japanese girl with CMT4F who was
compound heterozygous for the R1070X mutation and a 10-bp insertion
(605725.0009) in the PRX gene. Each of her unaffected parents was
heterozygous for 1 of the mutations. Haplotype analysis of this family
and the 3 Japanese families reported by Kijima et al. (2004) suggested
that the common R1070X mutation was a result of a mutation hotspot, not
a founder effect.

Tokunaga et al. (2012) reported 2 unrelated Japanese patients with
adult-onset CMT4F due to a homozygous R1070X mutation. One patient
developed mild distal muscle wasting and sensory disturbance in all
limbs at age 50 years. The disorder was slowly progressive, and she
could still walk independently at age 63 despite having pes cavus. Sural
nerve biopsy showed moderate demyelination and complex onion bulb
formation. The other patient developed lower limb weakness at age 37
years. At age 47, he could walk with a walking vehicle. Other features
included scoliosis and areflexia. Sural nerve biopsy showed myelin
thinning and onion bulbs. Motor nerve conduction velocities in the
median nerve were 20 m/s in both patients. Tokunaga et al. (2012)
emphasized the late onset and relatively mild phenotype in these
patients.

CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 4F
PRX, 4-BP DEL, 1194TTCC

In a boy with CMT4F (614895), Kabzinska et al. (2006) identified a
homozygous 4-bp deletion (1194delTTCC) in the PRX gene, resulting in a
frameshift and premature termination of the protein at codon 410.
Immunohistochemical studies on sural nerve detected the protein's N
terminus, but not the C terminus, indicating that the protein was
truncated in vivo. Both unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation.

.0011
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 4F, LATE-ONSET
PRX, ASP651ASN

In a Japanese woman with adult-onset CMT4F (614895), Tokunaga et al.
(2012) identified a homozygous mutation in the PRX gene, resulting in an
asp651-to-asn (D651N) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
repeat domain. The mutation was not found in 292 control chromosomes,
but was found in 1 of 2,188 exomes. Her 3 unaffected brothers were all
heterozygous for the mutation. Functional analysis of the variant was
not performed. The patient had delayed independent ambulation due to
nonspecific infantile paralysis at age 18 months. At age 30 years, she
developed mild distal muscle weakness and sensory impairment in the
lower limbs. Upper limb wasting was observed at age 44 years, and she
had vocal cord paralysis. Other features included pes cavus, scoliosis,
and areflexia. The disorder was slowly progressive. At age 65, she had
to use leg braces and a wheelchair. Nerve conduction velocities were not
recordable and sural nerve biopsy showed significant demyelination.

191339	TITLE *191339 UBIQUITIN B; UBB
;;POLYUBIQUITIN B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitin, a small protein consisting of 76 amino acids, has been found
in all eukaryotic cells studied. It is one of the most conserved
proteins known; the amino acid sequence is identical from insects to
humans, and there are only 3 substitutions within the plant and yeast
sequences. Two classes of ubiquitin genes are recognized. Class I is a
polyubiquitin gene, such as UBB or UBC (191340), encoding a polyprotein
of tandemly repeated ubiquitins. The class II genes are fusion products
between a single ubiquitin gene and 1 of 2 other possible sequences,
either 52 or 76 to 80 predominantly basic amino acids (see UBA52,
191321, and UBA80, 191343, respectively). Ubiquitin is required for
ATP-dependent, nonlysosomal intracellular protein degradation, which
eliminates most intracellular defective problems as well as normal
proteins with a rapid turnover. Degradation involves covalent binding of
ubiquitin to the protein to be degraded, through isopeptide bonds from
the C-terminal glycine residue to the epsilon-amino groups of lysyl side
chains. Presumably, the function of ubiquitin is to label the protein
for disposal by intracellular proteases. The most abundant
ubiquitin-protein conjugate, however, is ubiquitin-H2A, in which
ubiquitin is bound to lys119 in histone H2A; this conjugate is not
degraded. Since such ubiquitinated histones are present primarily in
actively transcribed chromosomal regions, ubiquitin may play a role in
regulation of gene expression (summary by Wiborg et al. (1985) and Baker
and Board (1987)).

CLONING

Wiborg et al. (1985) determined that ubiquitin is encoded as a multigene
family.

Baker and Board (1987) studied cDNA and genomic clones of ubiquitin.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Webb et al. (1990) assigned the 3-coding unit
polyubiquitin gene UBB and its nonprocessed pseudogene to chromosome
17p12-p11.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Finley et al. (1989) demonstrated that the basic amino acids fused to
ubiquitin in the class II gene products represent ribosomal proteins,
and that their fusion to ubiquitin performs a crucial role in ribosome
biogenesis in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Redman and Rechsteiner
(1989) studied these 3-prime in-frame extensions of the ubiquitin genes
in mammalian systems and concluded, as did Finley et al. (1989), that
the C-terminal extension proteins are ribosomal components.

Sutovsky et al. (1999) demonstrated that sperm mitochondria are
selectively marked for destruction by a ubiquitin tag. In fertilized
eggs from rhesus monkeys and cows the ubiquitination was evident at
first mitosis. The signal typically disappeared between the 4-cell and
the 8-cell stages of development. This ubiquitination also occurs in the
male reproductive tract, but the ubiquitinated sites are masked by
disulfide bonds during passage through the epididymis.

Conaway et al. (2002) reviewed the role of ubiquitin in transcription
regulation in both proteasome-dependent and proteasome-independent
mechanisms.

Cui et al. (2010) showed that Cif homolog from Burkholderia pseudomallei
(CHBP) was a potent inhibitor of the eukaryotic ubiquitination pathway
in human cells. CHBP acted as a deamidase that specifically and
efficiently deamidated gln40 in ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like protein
NEDD8 (603171) both in vitro and during Burkholderia infection.
Deamidated ubiquitin was impaired in supporting ubiquitin-chain
synthesis. Cif selectively deamidated NEDD8, which abolished the
activity of neddylated Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs).
Ubiquitination and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of multiple CRL
substrates were impaired by Cif in enteropathogenic E. coli
(EPEC)-infected cells. Mutations of substrate-contacting residues in Cif
abolished or attenuated EPEC-induced cytopathic phenotypes of cell cycle
arrest and actin stress fiber formation.

- Association of Ubiquitin With Disease

Lowe et al. (1988) discussed the role of ubiquitin in a variety of
neuropathologic conditions including Parkinson disease (see 168600),
Pick disease (see 172700), and Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300).

The protein deposits in neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, and
neuropil threads in the cerebral cortex of patients with Alzheimer
disease and Down syndrome (DS; 190685) contain forms of beta-amyloid
precursor protein (APP; 104760) and ubiquitin-B that are aberrant in the
C terminus. Based on studies of homozygous Brattleboro rats with
diabetes insipidus who show a GA deletion in a GAGAG motif in mRNA
transcripts of the vasopressin gene (192340), van Leeuwen et al. (1998)
postulated that a dinucleotide deletion (delta-GA, delta-GT, or
delta-CT) could occur in mRNA transcripts as a consequence of aging. The
authors found GAGAG motifs in UBB mRNA, and predicted that a +1
frameshift in APP (APP+1) or UBB (UBB+1) would result in a protein with
an aberrant C terminus, lacking the glycine residue essential for
multiubiquitylation. Immunoreactivity to UBB+1 and APP+1 was found in
brains from patients with early- and late-onset AD and Down syndrome.
The aberrant UBB+1 and APP+1 proteins were not found in young control
subjects but were present in elderly control patients. The aberrant
proteins were not found in patients with Parkinson disease. Van Leeuwen
et al. (1998) stated that the process is probably not limited to
postmitotic cells; however, postmitotic neurons are less capable of
compensating for transcript-modifying activity and are thus particularly
sensitive to the accumulation of frameshifted proteins. Thus, during
aging, single neurons may generate and accumulate abnormal proteins,
leading to cellular disturbances and causing degeneration.

Van Leeuwen et al. (2006) found that the aberrant APP+1 protein was
present in neurons with beaded fibers in young individuals with Down
syndrome in the absence of any pathologic hallmarks of AD. Both APP+1
and UBB+1 were present within brain neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic
plaques from older DS patients and patients with various forms of
autosomal dominant AD. Moreover, APP+1 and UBB+1 were detected in the
neuropathologic hallmarks of other tau (MAPT; 157140)-related dementias,
including Pick disease (172700), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP;
601104), and less commonly frontotemporal dementia (FTD; 600274). Van
Leeuwen et al. (2006) postulated that accumulation of APP+1 and UBB+1
contributes to various forms of dementia.

Fratta et al. (2004) found that 70 to 80% of the vacuolated muscle
fibers in samples from 10 patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis
(147421) contained strong immunoreactivity to mutant ubiquitin (UBB+1)
in the form of numerous well-defined plaque-like, dotted, or elongated
aggregates. Similar aggregates were identified in 10 to 15% of the
nonvacuolated normal-appearing fibers. In the abnormal fibers, these
aggregates were concurrently immunoreactive for wildtype UBB and either
beta-amyloid or phosphorylated tau (MAPT; 157140). None of the control
biopsies were immunoreactive to UBB+1. Fratta et al. (2004) suggested
that the UBB+1-inhibited proteasome cannot properly degrade toxic
proteins, resulting in their accumulation and aggregation.

Tank and True (2009) expressed a protein analogous to UBB+1 in yeast
(Ubb(ext)) and demonstrated that it impaired the ubiquitin/proteasome
system. Ubb(ext) did not cause protein aggregation itself, but it
rendered yeast more susceptible to other toxic protein aggregates.
Ubb(ext) appeared to act as a modifier that altered substrate
ubiquitination and the function of the ubiquitin/proteasome system.

Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS; 182290) is a syndrome exhibiting multiple
congenital anomalies and mental retardation, with distinctive behavioral
characteristics, sleep disturbance, and dysmorphic features, associated
with a heterozygous interstitial deletion of 17p11.2. Heterozygous
frameshift mutations of the RAI1 gene (607642) seem to be responsible
for most of the SMS features, but other deleted genes in the SMS region
may modify the overall phenotype. In a comparative genome hybridization
analysis of the short arm of chromosome 17 in 30 patients with SMS,
Andrieux et al. (2007) found that 3 had large deletions and that 2 of
these had cleft palate, which was not found in any of the other
patients. The smallest extra-deleted region associated with cleft palate
and SMS was 1.4 Mb, contained less than 16 genes, and was located at
17p12-p11.2. Gene expression array data showed that the UBB gene is
significantly expressed in the first branchial arch in the fourth and
fifth weeks of human development. Together, the data supported UBB as a
candidate gene for isolated cleft palate.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ryu et al. (2008) found that newborn Ubb-null mice were smaller than
wildtype or heterozygous littermates and exhibited subtle perinatal
linear growth retardation, but they were otherwise indistinguishable
from wildtype mice. However, Ubb deletion led to adult-onset obesity
that strongly correlated with selective degeneration of neurons that
control energy balance in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Total
Ub levels were reduced in the hypothalamus of Ubb-null mice. Ryu et al.
(2008) concluded that adequate cellular UB is essential for neuronal
survival.

605527	TITLE *605527 METHIONINE ADENOSYLTRANSFERASE II, BETA; MAT2B
DESCRIPTION Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT; EC 2.5.1.6) catalyzes the
biosynthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) from methionine and ATP.
MAT II is a broadly expressed MAT consisting of catalytic alpha and
noncatalytic beta subunits encoded by MAT2A (601468) and MAT2B,
respectively. For additional general information on MAT, see 601468.

LeGros et al. (2000) designed degenerate PCR primers to tryptic peptide
sequence of MAT2B purified from human lymphocytes. They amplified a
partial cDNA from Jurkat cells and extended the cDNA using 3-prime and
5-prime RACE. A full-length MAT2B cDNA amplified from normal human
peripheral blood mononuclear cell RNA encodes a 334-amino acid protein
with a molecular mass of 38 kD. LeGros et al. (2000) predicted 2
prominent hydrophobic segments from the sequence. MAT2B has sequence
similarity with bacterial enzymes that catalyze the reduction of
TDP-linked sugars; however, antibodies to MAT2B do not react with E.
coli or yeast extracts.

LeGros et al. (2000) expressed a recombinant histone-tagged MAT2B that
had no MAT catalytic activity alone. However, the recombinant MAT2B
associated spontaneously with the alpha subunit from human and E. coli,
lowering the Km of MAT II for L-methionine, thus confirming a regulatory
role for the beta subunit.

607895	TITLE *607895 POLYCYSTIN 1-LIKE 3; PKD1L3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, Li et al. (2003) identified 2 genes on chromosome
16 with predicted translated sequences similar to polycystin-1 (601313),
which is encoded by the PKD1 gene. They designated the genes PKD1L2
(607894) and PKD1L3 and obtained full-length cDNAs by RT-PCR using
testis cDNA as template. The deduced 1,732-amino acid PKD1L3 protein
contains an N-terminal C-type lectin domain, followed by a central GPCR
proteolytic site and PLAT domain, a pair of PKD domains, and a
C-terminal putative channel pore region. It also has 11 transmembrane
domains. PKD1L3 does not possess the receptor egg jelly domain found in
PKD1L2. RT-PCR detected several alternative splice forms that are
generated by exon skipping. Northern blot analysis detected a 6.0-kb
transcript expressed at highest levels in placenta and at lower levels
in heart and lung. Quantitative real-time PCR detected higher expression
in liver and testis than in kidney. Li et al. (2003) also cloned mouse
Pkd1l3, which encodes a 2,151-amino acid protein that shares 59%
identity with human PKD1L3.

GENE FUNCTION

Ishimaru et al. (2006) hypothesized that transient receptor potential
(TRP) ion channel proteins other than TRPM5 (604600) might be expressed
in taste cells and be involved in taste transduction. Using in situ
hybridization, they detected expression of Pkd1l3 and Pkd2l1 (604532) in
mouse circumvallate taste cells. Pkd2l1 was expressed in all 3 tongue
taste areas and in the palate taste area, whereas Pkd2l1 was expressed
in circumvallate and foliate papillae, but not in fungiform papillae or
in the palate. Confocal microscopy and coimmunoprecipitation analysis
revealed coexpression of Pkd1l3 and Pkd2l1, but not Trpm5, in the apical
ends of taste cells in circumvallate and foliate papillae. Coexpression
of Pkd1l3 and Pkd2l1 was necessary for inducing changes in intracellular
calcium concentration in response to acid solutions, suggesting that
PKD1L3/PKD2L1 heteromers function as sour taste receptors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Li et al. (2003) determined that the PKD1L3 gene contains 30 exons and
spans about 70 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Li et al. (2003) mapped the PKD1L3 gene to
chromosome 16q22, 10 Mb centromeric of the PKD1L2 gene. They mapped the
mouse Pkd1l3 gene to chromosome 8A, about 8 Mb centromeric of the mouse
Pkd1l3 gene.

;;EPSILON COAT PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

COPE is a subunit of the heptameric coatomer protein complex, or COPI
(see 601924), which mediates transport between the Golgi complex and
endoplasmic reticulum.

CLONING

Shima et al. (1999) reported the cloning of COPE, which encodes a
308-amino acid protein. Time-lapse microscopy showed that COPE, as a
marker of COPI, is found on tubulovesicular transport complexes
shuttling anterograde, but rarely retrograde, cargo to the Golgi
complex.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the COPE
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP stSG29914).

;;GROWTH STIMULATION-EXPRESSED GENE, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF;;
ST2, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; ST2;;
INTERLEUKIN 33 RECEPTOR; IL33R
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IL1RL1 is an IL1 (see 147760) family receptor that is selectively
expressed on T helper-2 (Th2) cells and mast cells. It mediates the
biologic effects of IL33 (608678), a member of the IL1 family that
potently drives production of Th2-associated cytokines (e.g., IL4;
147780) (summary by Yagami et al., 2010).

CLONING

Tominaga (1989) isolated a murine gene, which they termed St2, as one of
the genes specifically expressed by growth stimulation in BALB/c-3T3
cells. The gene encodes 2 protein products: St2, the soluble secreted
form; and St2L, the transmembrane receptor form, which is very similar
to the interleukin-1 receptors (147810; 147911) that map to human
chromosome 2. Tominaga (1989) suggested that St2 gene expression is
related to the growth of cells and that an unknown signal is transduced
to control cell proliferation by binding of specific ligand(s). Because
the symbol ST2 had already been assigned to a locus on 11p (see 185440),
the HUGO Nomenclature Committee designated the human homolog of the
mouse St2 gene as IL1RL1.

By use of a mouse St2 probe to screen an activated human helper T-cell
line library, Tominaga et al. (1992) isolated a cDNA for IL1RL1, which
encodes a 328-amino acid protein with 9 potential glycosylation sites
and 3 Ig-like domains. By Northern blot analysis, Kumar et al. (1997)
detected expression of a 1.4-kb IL1RL1 transcript in skeletal muscle,
heart, brain, and pancreas, with additional 2.5- and 4.2-kb transcripts
in lung, liver, placenta, and kidney. By RT-PCR analysis, they observed
constitutive expression in mesenchymal and myeloblastic cell lines, with
further induction by phorbol ester or cytokine stimulation. Expression
in mouse, in contrast, occurs only between days 2 and 4 after exposure
to UVB irradiation.

Tago et al. (2001) found that a third splice variant of IL1RL1, ST2V,
has an additional exon, designated 5E, and encodes a protein with a
predicted molecular mass of 30 kD. Transfection of ST2V into COS-7 cells
resulted in expression of a glycosylated protein with an apparent
molecular mass of 40 kD. Using confocal laser microscopy, they localized
ST2V to the plasma membrane. RT-PCR with primers designed to amplify
exon 5E indicated expression in colon, stomach, small intestine, lung,
spleen, testis, and placenta, and no expression in brain, heart, liver,
kidney, and skeletal muscle. Tago et al. (2001) noted that this pattern
of expression is different from that of IL1RL1 or ST2L.

GENE FUNCTION

Brint et al. (2004) noted that, unlike most members of the Toll (see
TLR4; 603030)-IL1R (TIR) superfamily, IL1RL1 does not induce an
inflammatory response or activate NFKB (see 164011), although it does
activate MAP kinases. IL1RL1 is present on Th2 but not Th1 T
lymphocytes, and neutralization of IL1RL1 enhances Th1 cell responses
and inhibits allergic airway inflammation. Using macrophages from Il1rl1
-/- mice, Brint et al. (2004) detected enhanced production of
proinflammatory cytokines in response to IL1A (147760), IL1B (147720),
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR4 ligand, bacterial lipoprotein, a TLR2
(603028) ligand, and CpG, a TLR9 (605474) ligand, but not to poly(I:C),
a TLR3 (603029) ligand. These results suggested that Il1rl1 is a
negative regulator of IL1R1 (147810), TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 signaling.
Cotransfection of Il1rl1 into cells overexpressing Myd88 (602170) or Mal
(606252) inhibited Myd88/Mal-induced NFKB activation in a dose-dependent
manner. GST-fusion proteins containing the TIR domain of Il1rl1 were
able to interact with Mal or Myd88, suggesting that IL1RL1 inhibition of
TLR4 and IL1R1 signaling may be due to the sequestration of these
downstream signaling components by IL1RL1. Brint et al. (2004) proposed
that IL1RL1 is necessary for endotoxin tolerance and, by inhibiting TLR
responses, enhances Th2 responses.

Using immunoprecipitation, immunoblot, and pull-down analyses, Schmitz
et al. (2005) showed that IL33 (608678) bound to ST2. NFKB-dependent
reporter assays and flow cytometry demonstrated that IL33 signaled
through ST2. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of
transfected cells and ST2-expressing mast cells showed that IL33
stimulation recruited MYD88, IRAK (300283), IRAK4 (606883), and TRAF6
(602355), followed by phosphorylation of ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2
(MAPK1; 176948), p38 (MAPK14; 600289), and JNK (see 601158). Addition of
IL33 to polarized mouse Th2 lymphocytes expressing St2 resulted in
increased production of Il5 (147850) and Il13 (147683), whereas IL33
reduced the level of Ifng (147570) produced by polarized mouse Th1
cells.

Using immunohistochemistry, Xu et al. (2008) demonstrated that synovial
membranes from rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) patients expressed both
IL33 and ST2 in the lining layer and the interstitial sublining layers.
Immunohistochemical and RT-PCR analyses showed that primary synovial
fibroblasts from these patients expressed IL33 only after addition of
TNF (191160) and IL1B.

Using mice with a naturally occurring Ncf1 (608512) mutation reported by
Hultqvist et al. (2004) and rat type II collagen (CII), which, like
human CII (COL2A1; 120140), differs from the mouse sequence only at
residue 266, Hagenow et al. (2009) examined arthritis in a mouse model
that did not require the use of adjuvant. Mutant mice produced lower
levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but increased levels of
autoantibodies and greater numbers of T cells expressing Il33r. With
impaired T-cell tolerance of tissue-specific CII, the mice developed
severe arthritis. Hagenow et al. (2009) concluded that insufficient ROS
production promotes breakdown of immune tolerance and development of
autoimmune and adjuvant-free arthritis through an IL5- and
IL33R-dependent T-cell activation pathway.

By RT-PCR analysis of cultured human lung cell subpopulations, Yagami et
al. (2010) detected IL33R expression in endothelial and epithelial
cells, but not in fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells. IL33 induced IL8
(146930) expression in IL33R-positive cells, which could be inhibited by
IL33R small interfering RNA and, on epithelial cells only,
corticosteroid treatment. IL4 and IL13 enhanced IL33R expression. IL33
induced activation of ERK in epithelial cells and both ERK and p38 in
endothelial cells. Yagami et al. (2010) proposed that IL33-mediated
inflammatory responses of lung tissue cells may be involved in chronic
allergic inflammation of the asthmatic airway.

MAPPING

Tominaga et al. (1996) assigned the human IL1RL1 gene to chromosome 2 by
analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids. They refined the
assignment to 2q11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The gene is
very tightly linked to IL1R1 (147810). Together with the structural
similarity of IL1RL1 to IL1R1, the findings suggested to the authors a
functional relationship between these 2 genes. Sims et al. (1995) mapped
the IL1RL1 gene to 2q12 by inclusion within a YAC contig.

Dale and Nicklin (1999) showed by radiation hybrid mapping that IL1R2
(147811), IL1R1, IL1RL2 (604512), IL1RL1, and IL18R1 (604494) map to
2q12 and are transcribed in the same direction, with IL1R2 being
transcribed towards the cluster.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Shimizu et al. (2005) found a significant genetic association between
atopic dermatitis (ATOD; 603165) and a -26999G/A SNP (P-value =
0.000007; odds ratio 1.86) in the distal promoter region of the IL1RL1
gene in a study of 452 ATOD patients and 636 healthy controls. The
-26999A allele common among ATOD patients positively regulated the
transcriptional activity of ST2. In addition, having at least one
-26999A allele correlated with high soluble ST2 concentrations and high
total IgE levels in the sera from ATOD patients. Shimizu et al. (2005)
concluded that the -26999A allele of the IL1RL1 gene is correlated with
an increased risk for atopic dermatitis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Xu et al. (2008) found that St2 -/- mice exhibited attenuated induction
of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a model for RA, as well as reduced
production of Il17 (603149), Ifng, and Tnf in vitro and serum anti-type
II collagen IgG2a. Il33 administration exacerbated CIA, but did not
affect disease incidence, in wildtype mice, but not in St2 -/- mice.
Treatment of wildtype mast cells, but not those from St2 -/- mice, with
Il33 induced production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines,
including Il13. Mice lacking St2 and engrafted with wildtype mast cells
showed exacerbated CIA when treated with Il33. Xu et al. (2008)
concluded that IL33 is a critical proinflammatory cytokine for joint
disease that integrates fibroblast activation with downstream immune
activation via an IL33-driven, mast cell-dependent pathway. They
suggested that IL33 may be a therapeutic target for RA.

Buckley et al. (2011) found that St2 -/- mice were more susceptible to
polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture. The
increased susceptibility was associated with impaired phagosome
maturation and Nox2 (CYBB; 300481) function, which is required for
reactive oxygen species production. Peritoneal leukocyte accumulation
and phagocytic receptor expression were identical in St2 -/- and
wildtype mice.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PPP1R15A mediates growth arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage,
negative growth signals, and protein malfolding (Wu et al., 2002).

CLONING

By screening a radiation-treated myeloblastic leukemia cell cDNA library
with hamster Gadd34, Hollander et al. (1997) cloned human PPP1R15A,
which they called GADD34. The predicted 674-amino acid protein is highly
negatively charged and contains 4 central 34-residue repeats. It shares
52 to 55% amino acid identity with its rodent homologs. In addition, the
C terminus of GADD34 shares significant homology with the C terminus of
ICP34.5, an apoptosis inhibition protein of herpes simplex virus
(HSV)-1.

GENE FUNCTION

Hollander et al. (1997) found that treatment of various human cell lines
with DNA-damaging agents enhanced expression of GADD34. They proposed
that GADD34 may be involved in apoptosis.

Using differential expression and immunohistochemical analyses of benign
nevi and melanomas of different levels, Korabiowska et al. (1997)
observed p53 (TP53; 191170) negativity and high expression of GADD34,
GADD45 (GADD45A; 126335), and GADD153 (DDIT3; 126337) in all nevi.
However, in melanomas, p53 expression increased and GADD expression
decreased with the Clark level of melanoma thickness. Patient survival
time correlated negatively with p53 positivity and positively with
GADD45 and GADD153 expression. Korabiowska et al. (1997) concluded that
GADD proteins play an important role in the malignant transformation of
nevus to melanoma.

Using yeast and mammalian 2-hybrid screens with mouse Gadd34 as bait, as
well as in vitro binding analysis, Hasegawa et al. (2000) found that the
C-terminal region of Kif3a (604683) interacted with Gadd34.

Wu et al. (2002) noted that GADD34 and SNF5 (SMARCB1; 601607) can
coexist in a trimeric complex with chimeric leukemic HRX (MLL; 159555)
fusion proteins, leading to inhibition of GADD34-mediated apoptosis. By
mutation analysis, they showed that the GADD34 region homologous to the
HSV-1 ICP34.5 protein was necessary for interaction with SNF5. SNF5
could bind independently with the protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) catalytic
subunit (PPP1CA; 176875) and stimulate its activity in solution and in
complex with GADD34. SNF5 and PP1 did not compete for GADD34 binding,
but rather formed a stable trimeric complex with GADD34. Wu et al.
(2002) proposed that GADD34 mediates growth suppression, at least in
part, through its interaction with SNF5. They suggested that SNF5 may
function as a regulatory subunit of PP1, either independently or
together with GADD34.

Blais et al. (2004) determined that EIF2-alpha (EIF2S1; 603907), PERK
(EIF2AK3; 604032), ATF4 (604064), and GADD34 are involved in an
integrated adaptive response to hypoxic stress in HeLa cells.

In CT26 mouse colon cancer cells, Obeid et al. (2007) demonstrated that
anthracyclins induced immunogenic cell death by way of a rapid,
preapoptotic translocation of calreticulin (CALR; 109091) to the cell
surface. Anthracyclin-induced Calr translocation was mimicked by
inhibition of the Ppp1ca/Gadd34 complex. Administration of recombinant
Calr or inhibitors of Ppp1ca/Gadd34 restored the immunogenicity of cell
death elicited by etoposide and mitomycin C and enhanced their antitumor
effects in vivo.

One arm of the unfolded protein response results in the transient
shutdown of protein translation, through phosphorylation of the
alpha-subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor
(eIF2-alpha). Activation of the unfolded protein response and/or
increased eIF2-alpha protein levels are seen in patients with Alzheimer
(104300), Parkinson (168600), and prion diseases, but how this relates
to neurodegeneration was unknown. Moreno et al. (2012) showed that
accumulation of prion protein during prion replication caused persistent
translational repression of global protein synthesis by eIF2-alpha,
associated with synaptic failure and neuronal loss in prion-diseased
mice. Further, Moreno et al. (2012) showed that promoting translational
recovery in hippocampi of prion-infected mice was neuroprotective.
Overexpression of GADD34, a specific eIF2-alpha protein phosphatase, as
well as reduction of levels of prion protein by lentivirally mediated
RNA interference, reduced eIF2-alpha protein levels. As a result, both
approaches restored vital translation rates during prion disease,
rescuing synaptic deficits and neuronal loss, thereby significantly
increasing survival. In contrast, salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF2-alpha
protein dephosphorylation, increased eIF2-alpha protein levels,
exacerbating neurotoxicity and significantly reducing survival in
prion-diseased mice. Given the prevalence of protein misfolding and
activation of the unfolded protein response in several neurodegenerative
diseases, Moreno et al. (2012) concluded that manipulation of common
pathways such as translational control, rather than disease-specific
approaches, may lead to therapies preventing synaptic failure and
neuronal loss across the spectrum of these disorders.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hollander et al. (1997) determined that the GADD34 gene has 3 exons and
spans at least 2.6 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Hollander et al. (1997) mapped the GADD34 gene to chromosome
19q13.2, a region containing a cluster of DNA repair genes (e.g., ERCC1;
126380).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transcription factors containing the POU homeodomain have been shown to
be important regulators of tissue-specific gene expression in lymphoid
and pituitary differentiation and in early mammalian development. To
identify members of the POU family of transcription factors that may be
involved in the tissue-specific regulation of expression of genes in
insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas, Takeda et al. (1992) used PCR
and degenerate oligonucleotide primers specific for the homeodomain to
amplify POU-related sequences in human pancreatic islet mRNA. The
sequences of 2 of the PCR products were identical to human OCT1 (164175)
and 2 others were homologous to mouse Oct3. Takeda et al. (1992) showed
that 2 forms of OCT3 mRNA are expressed in adult tissues as a result of
alternative splicing--OCT3A and OCT3B. OCT3A and OCT3B are composed of
360 and 265 amino acids, respectively, of which the 225 amino acids at
the COOH-termini are identical. The sequence of human OCT3A showed 87%
amino acid identity with mouse Oct3. Reverse transcriptase PCR showed
low level of expression in both OCT3A and OCT3B mRNA in all adult human
tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Niwa et al. (2000) used conditional expression and repression in murine
embryonic stem (ES) cells to determine requirements for Oct3/4 in the
maintenance of developmental potency. Although transcriptional
determination has usually been considered as a binary on-off control
system, they found that the precise level of Oct3/4 governs 3 distinct
fates of ES cells. A less-than-2-fold increase in expression causes
differentiation into primitive endoderm and mesoderm. In contrast,
repression of Oct3/4 induces loss of pluripotency and dedifferentiation
to trophectoderm. Thus, a critical amount of Oct3/4 is required to
sustain stem cell self-renewal, and up- or downregulation induces
divergent developmental programs. Niwa et al. (2000) suggested that
their findings established a role for Oct3/4 as a master regulator of
pluripotency that controls lineage commitment and illustrated the
sophistication of critical transcriptional regulators and the consequent
importance of quantitative analyses.

Guo et al. (2002) showed that mammalian Foxd3 (611539) and Oct4 bound
identical regulatory DNA sequences in the osteopontin (SPP1; 166490)
promoter. Oct4 interacted directly with Foxd3, and both proteins
activated the osteopontin promoter, either alone or in combination.
Foxd3 also activated the Foxa1 (602294) and Foxa2 (600288) promoters,
and coexpression of Oct4 inhibited Foxd3-mediated activation of these
promoters.

Using affinity chromatography, Xu et al. (2004) showed that mouse Wwp2
(602308), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacted with Oct4. Mutation
analysis showed that the WW domains of Wwp2 were required for the
interaction, and both the N- and C-terminal regions of Oct4 could
interact with Wwp2. Wwp2 ubiquitinated Oct4 in vitro and in vivo, and
this activity required the catalytic cysteine within the HECT domain of
Wwp2. Ubiquitination of Oct4 inhibited its transcriptional activity and
directed its degradation by the proteasome. Expression of both Wwp2 and
Oct4 was reduced with differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells.

Zeineddine et al. (2006) showed that Oct3 has a role in cardiac
development in the early mouse embryo.

Wang et al. (2006) explored the protein network in which Nanog (607937)
operates in mouse ES stem cells. Using affinity purification of Nanog
under native conditions followed by mass spectrometry, Wang et al.
(2006) identified physically associated proteins. In an iterative
fashion they also identified partners of several Nanog-associated
proteins (including Oct4), validated the functional relevance of
selected newly identified components, and constructed a protein
interaction network. The network is highly enriched for nuclear factors
that are individually critical for maintenance of the ES cell state and
coregulated on differentiation. The network is linked to multiple
corepressor pathways and is composed of numerous proteins whose encoding
genes are putative direct transcriptional targets of its members. Wang
et al. (2006) concluded that this tight protein network seems to
function as a cellular module dedicated to pluripotency.

Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be generated from mouse
fibroblasts by retrovirus-mediated introduction of 4 transcription
factors, Oct3/4, Sox2 (184429), c-Myc (190080), and Klf4 (602253), and
subsequent selection for Fbx15 (609093) expression (Takahashi and
Yamanaka, 2006). These iPS cells, hereafter called Fbx15 iPS cells, are
similar to embryonic stem (ES) cells in morphology, proliferation, and
teratoma formation; however, they are different with regard to gene
expression and DNA methylation patterns, and fail to produce adult
chimeras. Okita et al. (2007) showed that selection for Nanog expression
results in germline-competent iPS cells with increased ES cell-like gene
expression and DNA methylation patterns compared with Fbx15 iPS cells.
The 4 transgenes were strongly silenced in Nanog iPS cells.

Wernig et al. (2007) independently demonstrated that the transcription
factors Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 can induce epigenetic reprogramming
of a somatic genome to an embryonic pluripotent state. In contrast to
selection for Fbx15 activation (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006),
fibroblasts that had reactivated the endogenous Oct4 (Oct4-neo) or Nanog
(Nanog-neo) loci grew independently of feeder cells, expressed normal
Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 RNA and protein levels, were epigenetically
identical to ES cells by a number of criteria, and were able to generate
viable chimeras, contribute to the germline, and generate viable
late-gestation embryos after injection into tetraploid blastocysts.
Transduction of the 4 factors generated significantly more
drug-resistant cells from Nanog-neo than from Oct4-neo fibroblasts, but
a higher fraction of Oct4-selected cells had all the characteristics of
pluripotent ES cells, suggesting that Nanog activation is a less
stringent criterion for pluripotency than Oct4 activation.

Using Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and Myc, Park et al. (2008) derived iPS cells
from fetal, neonatal, and adult human primary cells, including dermal
fibroblasts isolated from a skin biopsy of a healthy research subject.
Human iPS cells resemble embryonic stem cells in morphology and gene
expression and in the capacity to form teratomas in immune-deficient
mice. Park et al. (2008) concluded that defined factors can reprogram
human cells to pluripotency, and they established a method whereby
patient-specific cells might be established in culture.

Yu et al. (2007) showed that 4 factors, OCT4, SOX2 (184429), NANOG
(607937), and LIN28 (611043), are sufficient to reprogram human somatic
cells to pluripotent stem cells that exhibit the essential
characteristics of embryonic stem cells. These induced pluripotent human
stem cells have normal karyotypes, express telomerase activity, express
cell surface markers and genes that characterize human ES cells, and
maintain the developmental potential to differentiate into advanced
derivatives of all 3 primary germ layers.

Kim et al. (2008) showed that adult mouse neural stem cells express
higher endogenous levels of Sox2 and c-Myc than embryonic stem cells and
that exogenous Oct4 together with either Klf4 or c-Myc is sufficient to
generate iPS cells from neural stem cells. These 2-factor iPS cells are
similar to embryonic stem cells at the molecular level, contribute to
development of the germ line, and form chimeras. Kim et al. (2008)
proposed that, in inducing pluripotency, the number of reprogramming
factors can be reduced when using somatic cells that endogenously
express appropriate levels of complementing factors.

Stadtfeld et al. (2008) generated mouse iPS cells from fibroblasts and
liver cells by using nonintegrating adenoviruses transiently expressing
Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. These adenoviral iPS cells showed DNA
demethylation characteristic of reprogrammed cells, expressed endogenous
pluripotency genes, formed teratomas, and contributed to multiple
tissues, including the germ cell line, in chimeric mice. Stadtfeld et
al. (2008) concluded that their results provided strong evidence that
insertional mutagenesis is not required for in vitro reprogramming.

Okita et al. (2008) independently reported the generation of mouse iPS
cells without viral vectors. Repeated transfection of 2 expression
plasmids, one containing the cDNAs of Oct3/4, Sox2, and Klf4 and the
other containing the c-Myc cDNA, into mouse embryonic fibroblasts
resulted in iPS cells without evidence of plasmid integration, which
produced teratomas when transplanted into mice and contributed to adult
chimeras. Okita et al. (2008) concluded that the production of
virus-free iPS cells, albeit from embryonic fibroblasts, addresses a
critical safety concern for potential use of iPS cells in regenerative
medicine.

Donohoe et al. (2009) demonstrated that OCT4 lies at the top of the X
chromosome inactivation (XCI) hierarchy, and regulates XCI by triggering
X chromosome pairing and counting. OCT4 directly binds TSIX (300181) and
XITE (300074), 2 regulatory noncoding RNA genes of the X inactivation
center, and also complexes with SCI transfactors CTCF (604167) and YY1
(600013) through protein-protein interactions. Depletion of Oct4 in
female mouse embryonic stem cells blocked homologous X-chromosome
pairing and resulted in the inactivation of both X chromosomes. Donohoe
et al. (2009) concluded that they identified the first trans-factor that
regulates counting, and ascribed new functions to OCT4 during X
chromosome reprogramming.

Kim et al. (2009) showed that Oct4 alone is sufficient to directly
reprogram adult mouse neural stem cells to iPS cells. Kim et al. (2009)
then showed that OCT4 alone could convert human fetal neural stem cells
into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.

Hanna et al. (2009) demonstrated that the reprogramming by Oct4, Sox2,
Klf4, and Myc transcription factors is a continuous stochastic process
where almost all mouse donor cells eventually give rise to iPS cells on
continued growth and transcription factor expression. Additional
inhibition of the p53 (191170)/p21 (116899) pathway or overexpression of
Lin28 increased the cell division rate and resulted in an accelerated
kinetics of iPS cell formation that was directly proportional to the
increase in cell proliferation. In contrast, Nanog (607937)
overexpression accelerated reprogramming in a predominantly cell
division rate-independent manner. Quantitative analyses defined distinct
cell division rate-dependent and -independent modes for accelerating the
stochastic course of reprogramming, and suggested that the number of
cell divisions is a key parameter driving epigenetic reprogramming to
pluripotency.

The generation of iPS cells is asynchronous and slow, the frequency is
low (less than 0.1%), and DNA demethylation constitutes a bottleneck. To
determine regulatory mechanisms involved in reprogramming, Bhutani et
al. (2010) generated interspecies heterokaryons (fused mouse ES cells
and human fibroblasts) that induced reprogramming synchronously,
frequently, and fast. Bhutani et al. (2010) showed that reprogramming
toward pluripotency in single heterokaryons was initiated without cell
division or DNA replication, rapidly (1 day) and efficiently (70%).
Short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown showed that AID (605257) is
required for promoter demethylation and induction of OCT4 and NANOG gene
expression. AID protein bound silent methylated OCT4 and Nanog promoters
in fibroblasts, but not active demethylated promoters in ES cells.
Bhutani et al. (2010) concluded that their data provided the first
evidence that mammalian AID is required for active DNA demethylation and
initiation of nuclear reprogramming toward pluripotency in human somatic
cells.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq), Kunarso et
al. (2010) showed that genomic regions bound by CTCF were highly
conserved between undifferentiated mouse and human embryonic stem cells.
However, very little conservation was found for regions bound by OCT4
and NANOG. Most of the differences in OCT4 and NANOG binding between
species appeared to be due to species-specific insertion of transposable
elements, such as endogenous ERV1 repeats, that generated unique OCT4-
and NANOG-repeat-associated binding sites.

Chia et al. (2010) reported a genomewide RNA interference screen to
identify genes that regulate self-renewal and pluripotency properties in
human embryonic stem cells. Functionally distinct complexes involved in
transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling were among the
factors identified in the screen. To understand the roles of these
potential regulators of human embryonic stem cells, Chia et al. (2010)
studied transcription factor PRDM14 (611781) to gain insights into its
functional roles in the regulation of pluripotency. Chia et al. (2010)
showed that PRDM14 regulates directly the expression of key pluripotency
gene POU5F1 through its proximal enhancer. Genomewide location profiling
experiments revealed that PRDM14 colocalized extensively with other key
transcription factors such as OCT4, NANOG (607937), and SOX2 (184429),
indicating that PRDM14 is integrated into the core transcriptional
regulatory network. More importantly, in a gain-of-function assay, they
showed that PRDM14 is able to enhance the efficiency of reprogramming of
human fibroblasts in conjunction with OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 (602253).

GENE STRUCTURE

Takeda et al. (1992) showed that the OCT3 gene spans about 7 kb and
consists of 5 exons.

MAPPING

Using pairs of sequence-specific primers and DNA from a panel of somatic
cell hybrids, Takeda et al. (1992) mapped the OCT3 gene to chromosome 6.
This localization was confirmed by linkage of a RFLP in 9 CEPH families,
indicating tight linkage to HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DR. No recombinants were
identified with any of these and lod scores ranged from 5.72 to 10.84.
By in situ hybridization, Guillaudeux et al. (1993) mapped the OTF3 gene
to 6p22-p21.3 within or close to the human MHC class I region. The
homologous mouse gene, Otf3, is located on mouse chromosome 17 between
the Q and T regions of the major histocompatibility complex. Takeda et
al. (1992) identified a related gene, symbolized OTF3C (OTF3P1), which
is a retroposon located on human chromosome 8; this gene is a
pseudogene. Guillaudeux et al. (1993) localized one OTF3-like copy
(OTF3L) to 12p13 by in situ hybridization. The functional significance
of this gene was not known. Using recombinant families, pulsed field gel
electrophoresis, and YAC mapping, Crouau-Roy et al. (1994) localized the
OTF3 gene within the MHC class I region, approximately 100 kb telomeric
to the HLA-C gene.

CYTOGENETICS

- POU5F1/EWS Fusion Gene

Yamaguchi et al. (2005) identified a t(6;22)(p21;q12) translocation in
tumor tissue derived from an undifferentiated sarcoma from the pelvic
bone of a 39-year-old woman. The translocation resulted in a POU5F1/EWS
(EWSR1; 133450) chimeric gene composed of the N-terminal domain of EWS
that functions as a transcriptional activation domain and the C-terminal
DNA-binding domain of POU5F1. Yamaguchi et al. (2005) suggested that the
tumor may be a variant of Ewing sarcoma (612219).

ANIMAL MODEL

Via homologous recombination in ES cells, Nichols et al. (1998)
generated mice with targeted disruption of the Oct4, or Oct3, gene.
Oct4-deficient embryos developed to the blastocyst stage, but the inner
cell mass cells were not pluripotent. Instead, they were restricted to
differentiation along the extraembryonic trophoblast lineage.
Furthermore, in the absence of a true inner cell mass, trophoblast
proliferation was not maintained in Oct4 -/- embryos. Expansion of
trophoblast precursors was restored, however, by an Oct4 target gene
product, fibroblast growth factor-4 (see 164980). Therefore, Oct4 also
determines paracrine growth factor signaling from stem cells to the
trophectoderm. Nichols et al. (1998) concluded that the activity of Oct4
is essential for the identity of the pluripotential founder cell
population in the mammalian embryo.

Tay et al. (2008) demonstrated the existence of many naturally occurring
miRNA targets in the amino acid coding sequences of the mouse Nanog
(607937), Oct4, and Sox2 (184429) genes. Some of the mouse targets
analyzed do not contain the miRNA seed, whereas others span exon-exon
junctions or are not conserved in the human and rhesus genomes. MiRNA134
(610164), miRNA296 (610945), and miRNA470, upregulated on retinoic
acid-induced differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells, target the
coding sequence of each transcription factor in various combinations,
leading to transcriptional and morphologic changes characteristic of
differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, and resulting in a new
phenotype. Silent mutations at the predicted targets abolished miRNA
activity, prevented the downregulation of the corresponding genes, and
delayed the induced phenotype. Tay et al. (2008) concluded that their
findings demonstrated the abundance of coding sequence-located miRNA
targets, some of which can be species-specific, and supported an
augmented model whereby animal miRNAs exercise their control on mRNAs
through targets that can reside beyond the 3-prime untranslated region.

HISTORY

Oct3 is present in mouse oocytes before and after fertilization. Rosner
et al. (1991) reported that when fertilized oocytes were injected with
antisense Oct3 oligonucleotides or double-stranded DNA containing the
octamer motif, embryonic DNA synthesis was inhibited and the embryos
were arrested at the 1-cell stage. In vitro synthesized Oct3 mRNA
rescued the developmental block induced by antisense Oct3
oligonucleotide. Thus, maternally inherited Oct3 appeared to be required
for DNA replication and division of the 1-cell embryo. However, the
authors published a retraction: 'Recent investigations have revealed
that the experimental evidence supporting the conclusions of the paper
by Rosner et al. (Cell 64, 1103-1110, 1991) has been fabricated by one
of the authors (M.R.) without any knowledge by the others. We therefore
retract this paper in its entirety.' This seems to be scientific fraud
comparable to that perpetrated by the infamous John R. Darsee, who
confessed to fabrication of data showing linkage of HLA and familial
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (192600).

614043	TITLE *614043 LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT IN FLII-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2; LRRFIP2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LRRFIP2 modulates NF-kappa-B (see 164011) activity through its
interaction with the Toll-like receptor (TLR; see 601194) adaptor
protein MYD88 (602170) (Gunawardena et al., 2011).

CLONING

Using the N-terminal leucine-rich repeat region of FLI (FLII; 600362) as
bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, followed by
EST database analysis and RT-PCR of skeletal muscle RNA, Fong and de
Couet (1999) cloned 2 LRRFIP2 splice variants, LRRFIP2a and LRRFIP2b.
LRRFIP2a contains an exon that is absent in LRRFIP2b. Full-length
LRRFIP2a encodes a deduced 721-amino acid protein. Northern blot
analysis detected LRRFIP2 transcripts of 3.9 and 2.8 kb in heart and
skeletal muscle. Other tissues expressed a single 2.7-kb transcript, and
brain expressed a unique 2.9-kb transcript.

Dai et al. (2009) noted that the LRRFIP2 protein contains an N-terminal
serine-rich domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil region.

GENE FUNCTION

Using overexpression and knockdown studies with murine macrophage cell
lines and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, Dai et al. (2009)
identified LRRFIP2 as a modulator of the NF-kappa-B immune response.
LRRFIP2 positively activated NF-kappa-B in response to the TLR4 (603030)
agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the TLR3 (603029) agonist poly(I:C),
and the TLR9 (605474) agonist ODN1826, a synthetic nucleotide, in
transfected mouse macrophages. LRRFIP2 coimmunoprecipitated with MyD88,
an adaptor molecule essential for signaling by most TLRs, in transfected
HEK293T cells. Mutation analysis showed that the MyD88-LRRFIP2
interaction required the serine-rich domain of LRRFIP2. Knockdown of
MyD88 in mouse cells or LRRFIP2 in human cells reduced LPS-mediated
activation of an NF-kappa B reporter. In response to LPS treatment, both
LRRFIP2 and Flap1 (LRRFIP1; 603256) disrupted the inhibitory interaction
of MyD88 with Flii in transfected HEK293T cells. LRRFIP2 and Flap1
appeared to compete with Flii for the same binding site on MyD88. Using
a proteomic approach, Dai et al. (2009) found that the interactions of
endogenous Lrrfip2, Flap1, and Flii with transfected MyD88 in mouse
macrophages were dynamic, complex, and time dependent. Dai et al. (2009)
hypothesized that particular TLR agonists induce interactions between
LRRFIP2, FLAP1, FLII, and MYD88 to govern the intensity and duration of
TLR-mediated inflammatory responses.

Gunawardena et al. (2011) identified 23 serines within the serine-rich
domain of human LRRFIP2 that were phosphorylated in a time-dependent
manner following LPS stimulation. Substitution of ser202 with a
nonphosphorylated residue weakened the LRRFIP2-MyD88 interaction and
reduced downstream NF-kappa-B activity. Gunawardena et al. (2011)
concluded that phosphorylation of ser202 regulates the strength of the
LRRFIP2-MYD88 interaction, which in turn modulates the strength and
duration of TLR4 signaling.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the LRRFIP2 gene to chromosome 3p22.2 based on an
alignment of the LRRFIP2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF115509) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Among a series of 84 Lynch syndrome families with germline mutations in
MLH1 (120436), MSH2 (609309), or MSH6 (600678), Pinheiro et al. (2011)
identified a recurrent genomic breakpoint in 14 unrelated patients and
95 family members. All 14 probands harbored an identical deletion,
comprising exons 17 through 19 of the MLH1 gene and exons 26 through 29
of the LRRFIP2 gene, corresponding to the MLH1 mutation
1896+280_oLRRFIP2: 1750-678del (120436.0031). This mutation represented
17% of all deleterious mismatch repair mutations in their series.
Haplotype analysis showed a conserved region of approximately 1 Mb, and
the mutation age was estimated to be 283 +/- 78 years. All 14 families
originated from the Porto district countryside. Pinheiro et al. (2011)
recommended using this mutation as first line screening for Lynch
syndrome among families of Portuguese descent.

605020	TITLE *605020 VISUAL SYSTEM HOMEOBOX GENE 1, ZEBRAFISH, HOMOLOG OF; VSX1
;;RETINAL INNER NUCLEAR LAYER HOMEOBOX; RINX
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Homeodomain transcription factors control cell fates during the
development of all animals. The 'paired-like' subfamily of homeodomain
proteins has been implicated in craniofacial and ocular development.
This family is characterized by a homeodomain that is related to the
homeodomain of the Drosophila 'paired' protein.

CLONING

By PCR of a human embryonic craniofacial cDNA library using degenerate
oligonucleotides based on highly conserved motifs within the paired-like
homeodomain, Semina et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding VSX1. The
predicted 365-amino acid VSX1 protein contains a paired-like homeodomain
and a CVC domain. Human VSX1 shares 55% overall sequence identity with
the zebrafish and goldfish Vsx1 proteins and 35% overall identity with
the goldfish Vsx2 (CHX10; 142993) and mouse Chx10 proteins. PCR of a
panel of cDNA libraries detected VSX1 expression in embryonic
craniofacial, adult retina, and adult cornea libraries but not in adult
lens, embryonic or adult brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, skeletal
muscle, spleen, or thymus libraries.

Using a yeast 1-hybrid screen of an adult bovine retinal cDNA library
with the conserved core of the red/green visual pigment locus control
region (see CBD; 303800) as bait, followed by RT-PCR of a human retinal
library, Hayashi et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding VSX1, which they
termed RINX for 'retinal inner nuclear layer (INL) homeobox.' Hayashi et
al. (2000) also identified 5 splice variants of VSX1. RT-PCR analysis
indicated that the 2 major VSX1 transcripts are expressed in retina and
WERI, a retinoblastoma cell line expressing retinal cone genes, but not
in other tissues or in a rhodopsin-expressing retinoblastoma cell line.
Northern blot analysis detected a 2.0-kb main VSX1 transcript in retina
but not heart. In situ hybridization analysis of bovine retinal sections
demonstrated exclusive localization of VSX1 to cell nuclei in the middle
of the INL, likely belonging to bipolar cells.

Ohtoshi et al. (2001) cloned mouse Vsx1 by PCR of day 7.5 mouse embryo
cDNA using degenerate primers for paired-like homeobox genes. Mouse Vsx1
consists of 363 amino acid residues and contains a homeodomain and a CVC
domain. PCR detected expression of Vsx1 at very low levels during all
stages of embryogenesis. In adult retinal sections, Vsx1 was detected in
the outer half of the inner nuclear layer.

GENE STRUCTURE

The VSX1 gene spans approximately 6.2 kb and contains 5 exons (Semina et
al., 2000; Hayashi et al., 2000). Ohtoshi et al. (2001) determined that
the exon-intron structure of the human and mouse VSX1 genes is
completely conserved.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid mapping, Semina et al. (2000) mapped the VSX1 gene
to 20p11-q11. Hayashi et al. (2000) mapped the VSX1 gene to 20p11.2 by
radiation hybrid analysis.

Ohtoshi et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Vsx1 gene to the distal region of
chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Heon et al. (2002) identified mutations in the VSX1 homeobox gene for 2
distinct inherited human corneal dystrophies: posterior polymorphous
corneal dystrophy (PPCD1; 122000) and keratoconus (148300). One of the
mutations (R166W; 605020.0001) responsible for keratoconus altered the
homeodomain and impaired DNA binding. Two other sequence changes (L159M,
605020.0003 and G160D, 605020.0002) were associated with keratoconus and
PPCD1, respectively, and involved a region adjacent to the homeodomain.
The G160D substitution, and a fourth mutation (P247R; see 605020.0002)
affecting the highly conserved CVC domain, occurred in a child with very
severe PPCD1 who required a corneal transplant at 3 months of age. In
this family, relatives with the G160D change alone had mild to moderate
PPCD1, while P247R alone caused no corneal abnormalities. However, with
either mutation, electroretinography detected abnormal function of the
inner retina, where VSX1 is expressed.

Bisceglia et al. (2005) analyzed the VSX1 gene in 80 Italian patients
with keratoconus. They found 3 previously described missense changes
(see, e.g., 605020.0002) and a novel missense mutation (L17P;
605020.0005) in 7 (8.7%) of the 80 unrelated patients; they also found 2
previously undescribed intronic polymorphisms. The authors concluded
that the VSX1 gene plays an important role in a significant proportion
of autosomal dominant keratoconus cases.

In a case-control panel of 77 sporadic keratoconus patients and 71
controls and a keratoconus family panel involving 444 individuals from
75 families, Tang et al. (2008) screened for 3 keratoconus-associated
VSX1 mutations, L159M, R166W, and H244R. The R166W and H244R variants
were not found in the case-control panel, and L159M was detected in
heterozygosity in 1 control. In the family panel, R166W was not found;
L159M was detected in 3 affected and 2 unaffected individuals, and H244R
was detected in 2 affected and 1 unaffected individual. Tang et al.
(2008) concluded that their results did not support a role for variation
in the VSX1 gene in the pathogenesis of keratoconus.

Dash et al. (2010) analyzed the entire coding region, intron-exon
junctions, and 5- and 3-prime UTR of the VSX1 gene in 66 unrelated
patients with keratoconus, including 27 familial cases and 39 sporadic
cases. The G160D change (605020.0002), previously detected in a family
with PPCD1 and a family with keratoconus, was identified in 2 sporadic
keratoconus patients and was not found in controls; however, other
variants that were found did not segregate with disease and/or did not
demonstrate pathogenicity. Dash et al. (2010) concluded that VSX1 plays
a minor role in keratoconus pathogenesis.

Stabuc-Silih et al. (2010) analyzed the coding regions and intron-exon
junctions of the VSX1 gene in 113 unrelated Slovenian patients with
keratoconus, but identified no disease-causing mutations; they concluded
that other genetic factors are involved in the development of
keratoconus.

De Bonis et al. (2011) analyzed the VSX1 gene in 222 unrelated Italian
probands with keratoconus and reviewed previously published results. De
Bonis et al. (2011) found 1 novel and 3 previously identified VSX1
missense variants in 6 keratoconus patients, respectively (see, e.g.,
605020.0002 and 605020.0005), none of which had been found in controls.
They concluded that VSX1 has a possible pathogenic role in keratoconus,
although in a small number of patients.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
KERATOCONUS 1
VSX1, ARG166TRP

In an isolated patient with keratoconus-1 (148300), Heon et al. (2002)
reported heterozygosity for a missense mutation predicted to result in
an arg166-to-trp (R166W) substitution in the homeodomain of VSX1.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed decreased DNA binding by
the mutant protein.

.0002
CORNEAL DYSTROPHY, POSTERIOR POLYMORPHOUS, 1
KERATOCONUS 1, INCLUDED
VSX1, GLY160ASP

Heon et al. (2002) reported 4 sibs with moderate presentation of
posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD1; 122000) who were
heterozygous for a missense mutation in the VSX1 gene. The mutation
resulted in a gly160-to-asp (G160D) substitution. An offspring of one
sib manifested severe PPCD1, and was found to have also inherited a
pro247-to-arg (P247R) mutation in the CVC domain of VSX1 from her
asymptomatic father. Neither mutation was found in over 200 control
individuals.

In a 27-year-old Italian woman who had bilateral keratoconus (KTCN1;
148300), Bisceglia et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for the G160D
allele. The variant was also present in her affected father and brother,
but was absent from 2 other brothers who had suspected keratoconus by
videokeratographic examination.

Dash et al. (2010) identified the G160D change in 2 sporadic patients
with keratoconus; the variant was not found in 100 controls. Noting that
the G160 residue is not well conserved across species and that G160D is
predicted to be a benign change using the PolyPhen algorithm, Dash et
al. (2010) suggested that the G160D change might represent a rare
polymorphism or genetic modifier.

De Bonis et al. (2011) detected the G160D allele in a sporadic Italian
patient with keratoconus; the variant was not found in 200 controls.

.0003
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
VSX1, LEU159MET

This variant, formerly titled KERATOCONUS 1, has been reclassified based
on the findings of Tang et al. (2008) and De Bonis et al. (2011).

In a 2-generation family with keratoconus-1 (148300), Heon et al. (2002)
identified heterozygosity for a leu159-to-met (L159M) mutation near the
nuclear localization signal of the VSX1 gene in affected individuals.
The authors speculated that the mutation may interfere with the binding
of Ubc9 (601661), which is required for nuclear localization.

Tang et al. (2008) detected heterozygosity for the L159M variant in 3
affected and 2 unaffected individuals from a family panel as well as in
1 control from a sporadic case-control panel, and concluded that the
L159M variant does not play a role in the pathogenesis of keratoconus.

After reviewing published studies, De Bonis et al. (2011) stated that
the L159M variant may be considered to be a polymorphism without
pathogenic significance.

.0004
CRANIOFACIAL ANOMALIES AND ANTERIOR SEGMENT DYSGENESIS SYNDROME
VSX1, ALA256SER

In an African American family with abnormal craniofacial features and
anterior segment developmental anomalies (614195), Mintz-Hittner et al.
(2004) found a heterozygous G-to-T transversion at codon 256 in the CVC
domain of the VSX1 protein that resulted in a change of an alanine to
serine (A256S). The mutation was predicted to result in a change of
conformation and therefore activity of the protein. The A256S mutation
segregated with the 4 affected patients and was not found in any of 624

KERATOCONUS 1
VSX1, LEU17PRO

In 3 families with keratoconus-1 (148300), Bisceglia et al. (2005) found
a heterozygous T-to-C transition at nucleotide 323 in exon 1 of the VSX1
gene that resulted in a leu-to-pro substitution at amino acid 17 of the
protein (L17P). This substitution represents alteration of an amino acid
that has been well conserved from zebrafish to humans.

In 2 Italian patients with keratoconus, 1 sporadic and 1 familial, De
Bonis et al. (2011) detected the L17P allele; the variant was not found
in 200 controls.

607958	TITLE *607958 SYNTAXIN-BINDING PROTEIN 6; STXBP6
;;AMISYN;;
HSPC156
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

STXBP6 binds components of the SNARE complex (see 603215) and may be
involved in regulating SNARE complex formation (Scales et al., 2002).

CLONING

By searching EST databases using the VAMP (see VAMP8; 603177)-like coil
domain of tomosyn (604586) as probe, Scales et al. (2002) identified a
full-length cDNA encoding STXBP6, which they called amisyn. The deduced
222-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 25 kD.
STXBP6 contains a unique N terminus and a C-terminal tomosyn-like
coiled-coil domain. Unlike other SNAREs of the VAMP family, it lacks a
hydrophobic stretch that could serve as a transmembrane anchor. The
coiled-coil domain of STXBP6 shares 37% and 31% amino acid identity with
those of tomosyn and VAMP8, respectively. Northern blot analysis
detected highest expression of a 4.0-kb transcript in brain and heart.
Western blot analysis of rat tissues showed that Stxbp6 migrated with an
apparent molecular mass of about 24 kD. Highest protein levels were
detected in brain, with lower levels in heart, adrenal gland, testis,
liver, and kidney. Stxbp6 showed strong expression in all specific human
brain regions examined. Fractionation of rat brain showed that Stxbp6
was predominantly cytosolic, but about 25% fractionated with the
membrane pellet. Membrane-associated Stxbp6 did not extract under
conditions where peripheral membrane proteins disassociated and did not
solubilize with several nonionic detergents, and only a small portion
dissociated with Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitation of rat brain extracts
indicated that Stxbp6 coimmunoprecipitated with syntaxin-1 (186590) and
SNAP25 (600322).

GENE FUNCTION

Scales et al. (2002) determined that the coiled-coil domain of STXBP6
bound specifically to syntaxin-1 and to a lesser extent to syntaxin-4
(186591) and SNAP25. Full-length STXBP6 bound syntaxin-1 more
efficiently than the coiled-coil domain alone.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the STXBP6
gene to chromosome 14 (TMAP SHGC-1393).

604200	TITLE *604200 SIALIC ACID-BINDING IMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE LECTIN 5; SIGLEC5
;;CD33 ANTIGEN-LIKE 2; CD33L2;;
OB-BINDING PROTEIN 2; OBBP2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (SIGLECs), such as
SIGLEC5, are a subgroup of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily that
mediate protein-carbohydrate interactions. They specifically interact
with sialic acids in glycoproteins and glycolipids, with each SIGLEC
having a particular preference for both the nature of the sialic acid
and its glycosidic linkage to adjacent sugars. SIGLECs have similar
structures, including extracellular Ig-like domains composed of an
N-terminal V-set domain followed by varying numbers of C2-set domains.
It appears that all SIGLECs have an unusual arrangement of conserved
cysteine residues in the V-set and adjacent C2-set domains. Most SIGLECs
are expressed uniquely within the hematopoietic system (Cornish et al.,
1998).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for cDNAs that encode proteins with
sequence similarity to the CD33 protein (159590), Cornish et al. (1998)
identified SIGLEC5. They isolated a full-length human macrophage SIGLEC5
cDNA encoding a deduced 551-amino acid protein with all the key
structural features of SIGLECs. SIGLEC5 contains a signal peptide, 4
extracellular Ig-like domains consisting of an N-terminal V-set domain
and 3 C2-set domains, a transmembrane domain, 2 cytoplasmic ITIM
(immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif)-like motifs, and 8
potential N-linked glycosylation sites. SIGLEC5 has high sequence
similarity to CD33 and OBBP1 (SIGLEC6; 604405). Western blot analysis of
neutrophil lysates indicated that SIGLEC5 exists as a disulfide-linked
dimer of approximately 140 kD. Northern blot analysis detected 2 major
SIGLEC5 transcripts of 2.4 and 3.4 kb in various tissues, with the
highest levels in hematopoietic organs, notably bone marrow and spleen.
SIGLEC5 protein was present on neutrophils but absent from leukemic cell
lines representing early stages of myelomonocytic differentiation.

By screening a human erythroleukemic cell line cDNA library with a
full-length OBBP1 cDNA, Patel et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding
OBBP2. They stated that OBBP2 is identical to SIGLEC5 (Cornish et al.,
1998). The deduced OBBP2 protein shares 59% and 56% sequence identity
with OBBP1 and CD33, respectively. All 3 of these proteins have a
cytoplasmic domain containing putative sites of tyrosine
phosphorylation, including an immunoreceptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory
motif and a motif found in SLAM (603492) and SLAM-like proteins.
Northern blot analysis detected highest OBBP2 expression in peripheral
blood leukocytes, with moderate to low expression in spleen, lung, and
placenta.

GENE FUNCTION

Cornish et al. (1998) found that recombinant SIGLEC5 expressed in COS
cells mediated sialic acid-dependent binding to human erythrocytes.
SIGLEC5 bound to alpha-2,3- and alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid equally.

Patel et al. (1999) found that recombinant OBBP2 and CD33 bound weakly
to leptin, whereas OBBP1 exhibited tight and specific binding to leptin.

MAPPING

Cornish et al. (1998) mapped the SIGLEC5 gene to 19q13.41-q13.43 using
FISH. By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid mapping, Kim (1999)
mapped the SIGLEC5 gene to 19q13.3.

EVOLUTION

Nguyen et al. (2006) noted that, although chimpanzees share more than
99% protein sequence identity with humans and are thought to be the best
animal model for human diseases, chimpanzees do not progress to acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) after human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) infection and are not prone to common T cell-mediated disorders,
such as bronchial asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, type I
diabetes, and chronic active hepatitis. Using flow cytometric analysis,
Nguyen et al. (2006) determined that chimpanzee T-cell numbers were 2
orders of magnitude lower than in humans following activation by T-cell
receptor (TCR) stimulation, whereas the proliferative response in
chimpanzees to mitogen stimulation was only somewhat lower than in
humans. They found striking differences in expression of SIGLECs,
particularly SIGLEC5, between human and great ape lymphocytes.
Approximately 60% of chimpanzee lymphocytes expressed SIGLEC5, but only
3.4% of human lymphocytes did. Furthermore, approximately 83% of
chimpanzee CD4 (186940)-positive T cells expressed SIGLEC5, whereas less
than 2% of human CD4-positive T cells expressed SIGLEC5. Antibody to
SIGLEC5 enhanced TCR-mediated lymphoproliferation in chimpanzees,
although not to the level seen in humans, and transfection of SIGLEC5
into human cells inhibited TCR responses. Nguyen et al. (2006) concluded
that the human-specific loss of T-cell SIGLEC expression and its
associated T-cell hyperactivity may contribute to the differences in
prevalence and severity of T cell-mediated diseases, particularly AIDS
and chronic active hepatitis, between humans and chimpanzees.

103190	TITLE *103190 ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR 3; ARF3
DESCRIPTION For general information on ADP-ribosylation factors, see 103180.

CLONING

Bobak et al. (1989) identified an ARF3 cDNA from a human cerebellum
library.

Tsai et al. (1991) isolated and characterized the human ARF3 gene. They
also showed that two ARF3 mRNAs of 3.7 and 1.2 kb are generated through
the use of alternative polyadenylation signals.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsai et al. (1991) found that the ARF3 gene spans approximately 18.3 kb
and contains 5 exons. They found multiple transcription start sites and
determined that the conserved amino acid sequences involved in guanine
nucleotide binding by ARF3 are distributed among separate exons.

MAPPING

By PCR screening of a somatic cell hybrid panel and fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Hirai et al. (1996) mapped the ARF3 gene to 12q13.

605301	TITLE *605301 TRANSFORMING, ACIDIC, COILED-COIL-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; TACC1
TACC1/FGFR1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Amplification of various chromosomal regions in human breast carcinomas
has lead to the identification of protooncogenes involved in
tumorigenesis. For example, MYC (190080) in 8q24, CCND1 (168461) in
11q13, and ERBB2 (164870) in 17q12 are each observed in 20% of all
breast tumors. Still et al. (1999) noted that 8p11 is amplified in 10 to
15% of breast tumor samples but the only gene assigned to this region,
FGFR1 (136350), is typically expressed at the same levels in normal and
tumor breast tissue. By PCR analysis with primers obtained from an EST
database, generation of a BAC contig spanning 380 kb of the 8p11 breast
cancer amplicon-1, and probing fetal tissue libraries, Still et al.
(1999) isolated a cDNA encoding TACC1. The predicted 805-amino acid
TACC1 protein is rich in serine, proline, and acidic residues, has a
20-amino acid N terminus rich in tryptophan, contains 2 nuclear
localization signals but no DNA- or RNA-binding domains, and has a
200-residue C terminus with extensive alpha-helical segments expected to
adopt a coiled-coil structure. Northern blot analysis detected a major
8.0-kb TACC1 transcript in all tissues tested, with relatively weak
expression in liver and lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Still et al. (1999) found that introduction of TACC1 into stable cell
lines resulted in morphologic changes consistent with a transformed
phenotype and in anchorage-independent growth.

By yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, Lauffart et al.
(2002) showed that TACC1 interacted with C-terminal regions of CHTOG
(CKAP5; 611142) and GAS41 (YEATS4; 602116).

During neurogenesis, the nuclei of progenitor cells of the proliferative
ventricular zone oscillate in a cell cycle-dependent manner called
interkinetic nuclear migration (INM). In most cell types, the nucleus
closely follows the centrosome during migration; however, in neural
progenitors, centrosomes remain near the ventricular zone during INM.
Xie et al. (2007) showed that INM in mice was dependent on the
regulation of centrosome-associated microtubules by Cep120 (613446) and
Taccs. Cep120 and Taccs regulated the integrity of microtubules coupling
the centrosome and the nucleus. Cep120 interacted with Taccs and
regulated the localization of Tacc3 (605303) to the centrosome. Both
Cep120 and Taccs were essential for maintaining the neural progenitor
pool during mouse neocortical development.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Singh et al. (2012) reported that a small subset of glioblastoma
multiforme tumors (GBMs; 137800) (3.1%; 3 of 97 tumors examined) harbors
oncogenic chromosomal translocations that fuse in-frame the tyrosine
kinase coding domains of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes
FGFR1 (136350) or FGFR3 (134934) to the transforming acidic coiled-coil
(TACC) coding domains of TACC1 or TACC3 (605303), respectively. The
FGFR-TACC fusion protein displayed oncogenic activity when introduced
into astrocytes or stereotactically transduced in the mouse brain. The
fusion protein, which localizes to mitotic spindle poles, has
constitutive kinase activity and induces mitotic and chromosomal
segregation defects and triggers aneuploidy. Inhibition of FGFR kinase
corrected the aneuploidy, and oral administration of an FGFR inhibitor
prolonged survival of mice harboring intracranial FGFR3-TACC3-initiated
glioma. Singh et al. (2012) concluded that FGFR-TACC fusions could
potentially identify a subset of GBM patients who would benefit from
targeted FGFR kinase inhibition.

603844	TITLE *603844 NADH-UBIQUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE 1, SUBUNIT C1; NDUFC1
DESCRIPTION The multisubunit NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the first
enzyme complex in the electron transport chain of mitochondria. See
NDUFA2 (602137). Ton et al. (1997) isolated human heart cDNAs encoding
CI-KFYI (NDUFC1) and 4 other complex I subunits. The predicted protein
contains 76 amino acids.

By radiation hybrid analysis, Mao et al. (1998) mapped the NDUFC1 gene
to 4q28.2-q31.1. By radiation hybrid analysis, Emahazion et al. (1998)
mapped the NDUFC1 gene to 4q28.2-q28.3.

Smeitink and van den Heuvel (1999) reviewed the available molecular data
regarding the human nuclear-encoded complex I subunits.

102593	TITLE *102593 ACYLOXYACYL HYDROLASE; AOAH
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH) is a 2-subunit lipase present in phagocytic
cells. The enzyme specifically hydrolyzes the secondary acyl chains of
the lipopolysaccharide found in the walls of gram-negative bacteria
(summary by Whitmore et al., 1994).

CLONING

Hagen et al. (1991) cloned and characterized cDNA for human AOAH and
showed that its 2 subunits are translated from a single mRNA molecule
about 2.2 kb long.

GENE FUNCTION

Whitmore et al. (1994) stated the action of acyloxyacyl hydrolase on
lipopolysaccharide (or endotoxin) suggests that it modulates the host's
inflammatory response to gram-negative bacteria. This hypothesis was
supported by studies showing that the deacylation of lipopolysaccharide
by AOAH in vitro greatly reduces its toxicity and activity.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Whitmore et al. (1994) mapped the
AOAH gene to 7p14-p12.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lymphotoxin-alpha in a homotrimeric form is a soluble protein secreted
by activated lymphocytes and presumed to act as a modulator in the
immune response. The LT-alpha homotrimer shares its receptor with tumor
necrosis factor and binds to both TNF receptor-1 (191190) and -2
(191191). Lymphotoxin was first characterized as a biologic factor in
mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes having anticellular activity on
neoplastic cell lines. It is a glycoprotein with a relative molecular
mass (Mr) of 60,000-70,000, whereas monomeric lymphotoxin has an Mr of
25,000. Gray et al. (1984) isolated a chemically synthesized gene and
natural complementary DNA coding for human lymphotoxin and engineered
them for expression in E. coli. Cytotoxic and necrosis effects were
observed in murine and human tumor cell lines in vitro and in murine
sarcomas in vivo. TNF-beta (also known as lymphotoxin-alpha, or LTA)
shows 35% identity and 50% homology in amino acid sequence with the
TNF-alpha (191160). Aggarwal et al. (1985) showed that the 2 TNFs share
a common receptor on tumor cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Lo et al. (2007) identified lymphotoxin and LIGHT (604520), tumor
necrosis factor cytokine family members that are primarily expressed on
lymphocytes, as critical regulators of key enzymes that control lipid
metabolism. Dysregulation of LIGHT expression on T cells resulted in
hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia. In low density
lipoprotein receptor (606945)-deficient mice, which lack the ability to
control lipid levels in the blood, inhibition of lymphotoxin and LIGHT
signaling with a soluble lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LTBR; 600979) decoy
protein attenuated the dyslipidemia. Lo et al. (2007) concluded that the
immune system directly influences lipid metabolism and that lymphotoxin
modulating agents may represent a novel therapeutic route for the
treatment of dyslipidemia.

MAPPING

See 191160 for information on the situation of both TNFA and TNFB on 6p.
By analysis of deletions induced in lymphoblastoid cells by
gamma-irradiation, Evans et al. (1989) concluded that TNFB maps to the
interval between C4 and HLA-B. Spies et al. (1989) showed that the
TNF-alpha and TNF-beta gene cluster is about 210 kb from HLA-B on
6p21.3. Jongeneel et al. (1991) described polymorphic microsatellites
within a 12-kb region of the major histocompatibility complex that
includes the TNFB locus.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of an association between variation in the LTA gene and
inflammatory bowel disease, see IBD3 (604519).

Knight et al. (2003) discussed the desirability of in vivo
characterization of regulatory polymorphisms. They described
'haploChIP,' a method that uses chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and
mass spectrometry to identify differential protein-DNA binding in vivo
associated with allelic variants of a gene. Application of the approach
to the LTA locus identified functionally important haplotypes that
correlated with allele-specific transcription of LTA.

By means of a large-scale, case-control association study using 92,788
gene-based single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, Ozaki et al.
(2002) identified a candidate locus on 6p21 associated with
susceptibility to myocardial infarction (608446). Subsequent linkage
disequilibrium (LD) mapping and analyses of haplotype structure showed
significant associations between myocardial infarction and a single
50-kb haplotype comprised of 5 SNPs in LTA, NFKBIL1 (601022), and BAT1
(142560). Homozygosity with respect to each of the 2 SNPs in LTA was
significantly associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction.
In vitro functional analyses indicated that one SNP in the coding region
of LTA, thr26 to asn (153440.0001), effected a 2-fold increase in
induction of several cell-adhesion molecules, including VCAM1 (192225),
in vascular smooth muscle cells of human coronary artery. Moreover, a
SNP in intron 1 of LTA (153440.0002) enhanced the transcriptional level
of LTA. These results indicated that variants in LTA are risk factors
for myocardial infarction and implicate LTA in the pathogenesis of the
disorder. Ozaki et al. (2002) reviewed the mechanism by which variation
in LTA might function in increasing susceptibility to myocardial
infarction. Rupture of atherosclerotic plaques occurs predominantly at
the edges of the fibrous cap, an area of accumulated inflammatory cells
in close proximity to vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial
cells. Activated inflammatory cells stimulate their neighboring cells to
erode the extracellular matrix through the release of inflammatory
cytokines, and decay of the framework forming the plaque cap leads to
plaque rupture.

In 447 European trio families with myocardial infarction or symptomatic
acute coronary syndrome, the PROCARDIS Consortium (2004) demonstrated
strong linkage of the 26N haplotype to coronary artery disease: there
was evidence for excess transmission of the 26N allele to affected
offspring (chi square, 8.44; p = 0.0018), and weighted analysis using
reciprocal-variance weights confirmed the linkage (chi square, 8.47; p =
0.0018). The genotype risk ratio for the N26 allele was calculated to be
1.40 for heterozygotes and 1.96 for homozygotes, the latter being
comparable to the recessive association (OR, 1.78) found by Ozaki et al.
(2002) in the Japanese population.

Iida et al. (2003) provided a high-resolution SNP map of the myocardial
infarction critical region on 6p21, in which they detected 46 novel SNPs
among 64 chromosomes from 16 individuals with myocardial infarction and
16 control individuals.

By detailed haplotypic analysis of the gene and flanking regions of the
LTA locus in 52 chromosomes derived from lymphoblastoid cell lines from
unrelated individuals of European descent, Knight et al. (2004)
identified 12 SNPs present at greater than 10% allele frequency. Cells
carrying the LTA+80A SNP (153440.0003) produced less LTA on average than
other cells. They found that activated B-cell factor-1 (ABF1; 603628)
binds to this site in vitro and suppresses reporter gene expression, but
only in the presence of the LTA+80A allele. Using haploChIP analysis,
they confirmed that ABF1 is preferentially recruited to the low-producer
allele in vivo. The authors suggested that these findings provide a
molecular model of how LTA expression may be genetically regulated by
allele-specific recruitment of the transcriptional repressor ABF1.

Alcais et al. (2007) reported the linkage disequilibrium mapping of a
linkage peak associated with leprosy (LPRS4; 610988) found in a
genomewide scan by Mira et al. (2003), located close to the HLA complex.
In both a Vietnamese familial sample and an Indian case-control sample,
the low-producing lymphotoxin-alpha (LTA)+80 A allele (153440.0003) was
significantly associated with an increase in leprosy risk. Analysis of
an additional case-control sample from Brazil and an additional familial
sample from Vietnam showed that the LTA+80 effect was much stronger in
young individuals. Alcais et al. (2007) stated that their results showed
that LTA+80 did not have a substantial role in leprosy susceptibility in
individuals over 25 years of age. The A allele of LTA+80 is associated
with significantly lower levels of a downstream reporter than the C
allele (Knight et al., 2004). The findings of Alcais et al. (2007)
demonstrated that low levels of LTA production are associated with a
higher risk of leprosy. This result is consistent with studies in animal
models linking disruption of the LTA pathway with an increase in
susceptibility to intracellular pathogens.

ANIMAL MODEL

By histologic examination, Chin et al. (2003) observed considerable
perivascular infiltration of activated T lymphocytes in tissues from Lta
-/- and Ltbr (600979) -/- mice relative to age-matched wildtype mice,
particularly in lung, pancreas, liver, and kidney. This pattern was
similar to that observed in Aire (607358) -/- mice. Real-time PCR and
immunofluorescence analysis showed that the thymi of Lta -/-, Ltb
(600978) -/-, and Ltbr -/- mice had markedly reduced Aire and insulin
expression in thymic medullary epithelial cells. ELISA analysis
demonstrated increased anti-DNA antibody and anti-IgG rheumatoid factor
in 5- to 7-month-old Lta -/- and Ltbr -/- mice. Chin et al. (2003) noted
that LTBR signaling is mediated by the RELB (604758)-p52 (NFKB2;
164012)-NFKB (164011) pathway and that thymi from Relb -/- mice totally
lack Aire expression. Thus, they suggested that RELB may represent a
point of convergence of signals that regulate AIRE.

Lund et al. (2002) noted that Lta-deficient mice are thought to be
unable to generate effective T- and B-cell responses due to a lack of
lymph nodes and a disorganized splenic architecture. However, Lund et
al. (2002) found that, when challenged with virulent influenza A virus,
Lta -/- mice not only survived but generated similar numbers of
influenza-specific CD8 (see 186910) T cells able to produce Ifng
(147570) and to lyse target cells presenting influenza antigen as
wildtype mice. Furthermore, infected Lta-/- mice generated B cells
producing influenza-specific, isotype-switched antibodies. There was,
however, a delay in the humoral and cellular response that rendered Lta
-/- mice unable to withstand higher dose viral challenges, and they
succumbed to infection before the initiation of an effective adaptive
immune response. Lund et al. (2002) concluded that the presence of LTA
and/or lymph nodes accelerates the initiation of immune responses and
protects the host from larger viral challenges.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
LTA, THR26ASN

Ozaki et al. (2002) demonstrated that a SNP in the LTA gene (804C-A in
exon 3) that caused a threonine-to-asparagine substitution at codon 26
(thr26 to asn; T26N) was significantly associated with increased risk
for myocardial infarction (608446). In vitro functional analyses
indicated that the T26N change resulted in a 2-fold increase in
induction of several cell-adhesion molecules.

In 447 European trio families with myocardial infarction or symptomatic
acute coronary syndrome, the PROCARDIS Consortium (2004) confirmed a
significant association of the 26N allele with coronary artery disease.

.0002
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
LTA, 252A-G

Ozaki et al. (2002) found that homozygosity for a 252A-G change in
intron 1 of the LTA gene, was associated significantly with increased
risk for myocardial infarction (608446). Functional studies indicated
that the substitution in intron 1 affected transcription of LTA.
Suspecting that DNA-binding proteins could bind to parts of the DNA
sequence containing the SNP in intron 1 of LTA, Ozaki et al. (2002)
examined whether a nuclear extract from Jurkat cells was able to bind to
oligonucleotides corresponding to genomic sequences that included 252A
or 252G alleles. The band corresponding to the G allele was more intense
than that corresponding to the A allele, indicating that some nuclear
factor was binding more tightly to the G allele. This raised the
possibility that unidentified nuclear factor(s) regulating transcription
of LTA by binding to this region may represent new molecular entities
related to susceptibility to myocardial infarction.

In a study of 147 patients with psoriatic arthritis (607507) and 389
controls, Balding et al. (2003) found that the 252A allele was
significantly associated with both the presence and progression of joint
erosions in psoriatic arthritis, and that the GG genotype was associated
with the lowest mean age at onset of psoriasis (p = 0.0003).

Shin et al. (2004) genotyped a 550 Korean asthmatics and 171 Korean
controls at 5 SNPs in TNFA and 2 SNPs in LTA, including 252A-G. Six
common haplotypes could be constructed in the TNF gene cluster. The most
common haplotype of the TNF gene cluster, TNF-ht1-GGTCCGG, was
associated with total serum IgE levels (147050) in asthma patients,
especially in nonatopic patients (p = 0.004).

.0003
LEPROSY, EARLY-ONSET, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
LTA, 80A-C

Knight et al. (2004) identified a SNP of the LTA gene, LTA+80 (dbSNP
rs2239704), as a main predictor of LTA protein production by human B
cells. Cells carrying the LTA+80A SNP produced less LTA on average than
other cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis
indicated that the class II basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor
ABF1 (603628), specifically expressed in lymphoid tissue, binds to the
LTA+80A site in vitro and suppresses reporter gene expression.
Haplotype-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation (haploChiP) analysis
confirmed that ABF1 is preferentially recruited to the low-producer
allele in vivo. Knight et al. (2004) noted that another allele, LTA+252G
(153440.0002), not present on any of the chromosomes carrying LTA+80A,
may be associated with high LTA production and pathologic consequences
due to the absence of LTA+80A-related suppression.

Alcais et al. (2007) found that the low-producing LTA+80 A allele was
significantly associated with an increase in leprosy risk (610988)
especially in individuals diagnosed before 16 years of age. In the
combined sample of 298 Vietnamese familial trios, the odds ratio of
leprosy for LTA+80 AA/AC versus CC subjects was 2.11 (p = 0.000024),
which increased to 5.63 (p = 0.0000004) in the subsample of 121 trios of
affected individuals diagnosed before 16 years of age.
