606827	TITLE *606827 PLEXIN DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; PLXDC2
;;TUMOR ENDOTHELIAL MARKER 7-RELATED PROTEIN; TEM7R
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), St Croix et al. (2000)
identified partial cDNAs corresponding to several tumor endothelial
markers (TEMs) that displayed elevated expression during tumor
angiogenesis. Among the genes they identified was PLXDC1 (606826), which
they called TEM7. While searching databases for the mouse Plxdc1
ortholog, Carson-Walter et al. (2001) identified Plxdc2, which they
called Tem7r. They subsequently identified the human PLXDC2 sequence,
which encodes a predicted 529-amino acid transmembrane protein that
shares 91% amino acid identity with mouse Plxdc2.

In situ hybridization analysis of human colorectal cancer by
Carson-Walter et al. (2001) demonstrated that TEM7R was expressed
clearly in the endothelial cells of the tumor stroma but not in the
endothelial cells of normal colonic tissue. Using in situ hybridization
to assay expression in various adult mouse tissues, Carson-Walter et al.
(2001) detected Tem7r expression at high levels not only in tumor
endothelium but also in vessels of some normal tissues, with highest
expression in muscle and lung.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PLXDC2
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP WI-15162).
