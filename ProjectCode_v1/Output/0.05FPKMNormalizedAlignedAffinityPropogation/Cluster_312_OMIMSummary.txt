602118	TITLE *602118 CHROMODOMAIN HELICASE DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 1; CHD1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The murine gene 'chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein-1' (Chd1) was
isolated by Delmas et al. (1993) in a search for proteins that bind a
DNA promoter element. The presence of chromo (chromatin organization
modifier) domains and an SNF2-related helicase/ATPase domain led to
speculation that this gene regulates chromatin structure or gene
transcription. Woodage et al. (1997) cloned and characterized 3 novel
human genes related to the mouse Chd1 gene, referred to as CHD1, CHD2
(602119), and CHD3 (602120). Human CHD1 encodes a 1,709-amino acid
predicted protein that shares 95.5% identity with the 1,711-amino acid
mouse Chd1 polypeptide. Examination of sequence databases revealed
several more related genes, most of which were not known to be similar
to mouse Chd1, yielding a total of 12 highly conserved CHD genes from
organisms as diverse as yeast and mammals. The major region of sequence
variation is in the C-terminal part of the proteins, a region with
DNA-binding activity in mouse Chd1. Targeted deletion of the sole CHD
gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated that deletion strains were
less sensitive than wildtype to the cytotoxic effect of 6-azauracil.
This finding suggested to Woodage et al. (1997) that enhanced
transcriptional arrest at RNA polymerase II pause sites due to
6-azauracil-induced nucleotide pool depletion was reduced in the
deletion strain and that yeast CHD1 inhibited transcription. This
observation, along with the known roles of other proteins with chromo or
SNF2-related helicase/ATPase domains, suggested that alteration of gene
expression by CHD genes might occur by modification of chromatin
structure, which could alter access of the transcriptional apparatus to
its chromosomal DNA template.

Yeast SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) and SLIK (SAGA-like) are 2
highly homologous and conserved multisubunit HAT complexes, which
preferentially acetylate histones H3 (see 602810) and H2B (see 609904)
and deubiquitinate histone H2B. Pray-Grant et al. (2005) identified the
chromatin remodeling protein Chd1 as a component of SAGA and SLIK. Their
findings indicated that 1 of the 2 chromodomains of Chd1 specifically
interacts with the methylated lys4 mark on histone H3 that is associated
with transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the SLIK complex showed
enhanced acetylation of a methylated substrate, and this activity was
dependent upon a functional methyl-binding chromodomain, both in vitro
and in vivo.

GENE FUNCTION

Flanagan et al. (2005) described the structure of the tandem arrangement
of human CHD1 chromodomains and its interactions with histone tails.
Unlike HP1 (see 604478) and Polycomb (see 602770) proteins that use
single chromodomains to bind to their respective methylated histone H3
tails, the 2 chromodomains of CHD1 cooperate to interact with 1
methylated H3 tail. Flanagan et al. (2005) showed that the human CHD1
double chromodomains target the lysine-4-methylated histone H3 tail
(H3K4me), a hallmark of active chromatin. Methylammonium recognition
involves 2 aromatic residues, not the 3-residue aromatic cage used by
chromodomains of HP1 and Polycomb proteins. Furthermore, unique inserts
within chromodomain 1 of CHD1 block the expected site of H3 tail binding
seen in HP1 and Polycomb, instead directing H3 binding to a groove at
the interchromodomain junction.

Gaspar-Maia et al. (2009) demonstrated that the chromatin remodeling
factor Chd1 is required to maintain the open chromatin of pluripotent
mouse embryonic stem cells. Chd1 is a euchromatin protein that
associates with the promoters of active genes, and downregulation of
Chd1 leads to accumulation of heterochromatin. Chd1-deficient embryonic
stem cells are no longer pluripotent, because they are incapable of
giving rise to primitive endoderm and have a high propensity for neural
differentiation. Furthermore, Chd1 is required for efficient
reprogramming of fibroblasts to the pluripotent stem cell state.
Gaspar-Maia et al. (2009) concluded that Chd1 is essential for open
chromatin and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells, and for somatic cell
reprogramming to the pluripotent state.

MAPPING

Woodage et al. (1997) mapped the human CHD1 gene to 5q15-q21 by PCR
screening of the CEPH YAC library.

607860	TITLE *607860 YY1 ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; YY1AP1
;;YY1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; YAP;;
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; HCCA2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display PCR of normal hepatic tissue and hepatocellular
carcinomas, followed by screening a placenta cDNA library, Wang et al.
(2001) cloned YY1AP1, which they called HCCA2. The deduced 467-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 50.65 kD. HCCA2 contains
2 SH3-binding domains, 2 N-glycosylation sites, 6 N-myristoylation
sites, and numerous phosphorylation sites, but it does not have a
transmembrane domain, signal peptide, or targeting sequences. Northern
blot analysis detected 1.8- and 2.5-kb transcripts in all adult tissues
examined except liver. Expression was also detected in fetal liver,
lung, brain, and spleen. Western blot analysis of transfected embryonic
kidney fibroblasts detected HCCA2 at an apparent molecular mass of about
50 kD. Immunohistochemical staining showed that HCCA2 protein was
localized in the cytoplasm of liver cancer tissues, and it was not found
in surrounding nontumor hepatocytes.

Kuryshev et al. (2006) determined that YY1AP1 was formed by fusion of
the 5-prime region of the ASH1L gene (607999) and the 3-prime region of
the GON4L gene (610393) during a tandem segmental duplication on
chromosome 1. YY1AP1 contains the partial promoter and untranslated
first exon of ASH1L and coding exons 13 to 21 of GON4L. The 3-prime
region of YY1AP1 originated from a long terminal repeat of an endogenous
retrovirus, known as the MER51A repeat, that was inserted into exon 21
of GON4L after the duplication. The deduced YY1AP1 protein contains 750
amino acids, 748 of which correspond to amino acids 590 to 1,337 of the
GON4L protein. The last 2 C-terminal residues of YY1AP1 come from the
long terminal repeat of MER51A. RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression of
YY1AP1, with highest levels in testis and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2001) determined that HCCA2 was not expressed in normal
adult liver tissue, but it was expressed in 79% of hepatocellular
carcinomas tested. HCCA2 expression was associated with invasion of the
tumor capsule.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kuryshev et al. (2006) mapped the YY1AP1
gene to chromosome 1q22.

614463	TITLE *614463 NMYC DOWNSTREAM-REGULATED GENE 4; NDRG4
;;SMOOTH MUSCLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 8; SMAP8;;
KIAA1180
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Hirosawa et al. (1999) cloned NDRG4. The deduced protein
contains 273 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest expression in
adult and fetal brain and adult heart, followed by lung and testis.
Lower expression was detected in other adult tissues examined, but
little to no expression was detected in fetal liver. High NDRG4
expression was detected in all specific adult brain regions examined,
with highest expression in amygdala, cerebellum, and thalamus.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to NDRG1 (605262),
followed by 3-prime and 5-prime RACE of human brain and heart cDNA
libraries and cap-site hunting, Zhou et al. (2001) cloned 3 splice
variants of NDRG4. The variants NDRG4B and NDRG4B-var, which were
obtained from the brain library, encode deduced proteins of 339 and 352
amino acids with calculated molecular masses of 37.1 and 38.5 kD,
respectively. Compared with NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var has a 14-amino acid
insertion near the C terminus. The variant NDRG4H, which was obtained
from the heart library, encodes a deduced 371-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of 40.6 kD. NDRG4H differs from NDRG4B and
NDRG4B-var at its N-terminal end, and it lacks the 14-amino acid
insertion. Northern blot analysis detected NDRG4 transcripts of about
3.2 kb in brain and heart only. Variant-specific probes showed NDRG4B
expression in brain only, whereas NDRG4H was expressed in both brain and
heart, with higher expression in heart. RT-PCR confirmed expression of
all 3 variants in brain and of NDRG4H in heart. RNA dot-blot analysis
revealed NDRG4 expression in spinal cord, all specific brain regions
examined, and all specific heart regions examined except aorta.
Expression was also detected in spleen, lymph node, testis, adrenal
gland, and fetal brain and heart, but not in other tissues examined. In
situ hybridization of normal adult brain detected NDRG4 mRNA in
cytoplasm of neurons in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, mesencephalon,
pons, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. No signal was detected in
peripheral nerves or other cell types, such as glial cells. Western blot
analysis of endogenous or exogenously expressed proteins showed that
NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var, and NDRG4H had apparent molecular masses of 37, 39,
and 41 kD, respectively.

Using expression profiling to identify genes expressed in aortic smooth
muscle, followed by screening a heart cDNA library, Nishimoto et al.
(2003) cloned NDRG4, which they called SMAP8. The deduced 371-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 40.7 kD. Northern blot
analysis detected high expression of an approximately 3.3-kb transcript
in heart and brain, with little to no expression in other tissues
examined. PCR analysis showed moderate expression in aorta and vascular
smooth muscle cells. Western blot analysis of heart and brain detected
SMAP8 at an apparent molecular mass of about 45 kD. SMAP8 localized to
the cytoplasmic fraction of transfected A10 embryonic rat aortic smooth
muscle cells.

By in situ hybridization of adult mouse brain, Yamamoto et al. (2011)
detected wide distribution of Ndrg4 in neurons, but not in astrocytes.
Western blot analysis of adult mouse brain detected 3 Ndrg4 isoforms
representing orthologs of human NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var, and NDRG4H.

GENE FUNCTION

Nishimoto et al. (2003) showed that homocysteine upregulated SMAP8
expression in primary human aortic smooth muscle cells and rat A10
cells, but not in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Proliferation
and migration of A10 cells significantly decreased following expression
of human SMAP8. SMAP8 was phosphorylated by a serine/threonine kinase
via activation of a PDGF (see 173430) signaling pathway. In addition,
ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948) and MEK1 (MAP2K1; 176872)/MEK2
(MAP2K2; 601263) were activated in SMAP8-transfected A10 cells.

Hongo et al. (2006) found that overexpression of 1 of the 6 isoforms of
rat Ndrg4, Ndrg4c2, in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells reduced NGF (see
162030)-induced phosphorylation of Elk1 (311040), a nuclear target of
Erk. Reporter gene assays revealed that Ndrg4c2 suppressed Elk1-mediated
activation of a serum response element.

By RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis, Schilling et al. (2009)
found that NDRG4 expression was increased in glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM; see 137800) compared with normal human astrocytes. Knockdown of
NDRG4 via short hairpin RNA reduced the viability of GBM cells via G1
cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis. Knockdown of NDRG4 also
reduced the viability of several GBM cell lines and primary astrocytes.
Knockdown of NDRG4 in GBM tumor xenografts reduced tumor growth
following intracranial injection in immunocompromised mice.
Overexpression of NDRG4B or NDRG4H did not affect cell viability.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhou et al. (2001) determined that the NDRG4 gene contains 17 exons and
spans 26 kb. Exons 1 and 2 are specific for NDRG4H, exon 3 is specific
for NDRG4B and NDGR4B-var, and exon 16 is specific for NDRG4B-var. The
region upstream of exon 1 contains a GGCG sequence that may represent a
TATA-less promoter for NDRG4H expression. The region upstream of exon 3
contains a consensus TATA box and 2 CCAAT sequences and may represent
the promoter for NDRG4B and NDRG4B-var expression.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhou et al. (2001) mapped the NDRG4 gene
to chromosome 16q21-q22.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yamamoto et al. (2011) found that Ndrg4 -/- mice were born at the
expected mendelian ratio, appeared normal, and were fertile. However,
Ndrg4 -/- mice showed deficits in spatial learning and memory, and they
exhibited increased sensitivity to ischemic stress following middle
cerebral artery occlusion. Consistent with these findings, Ndrg4 -/-
mice had reduced expression of the neuroprotective factor Bdnf (113505).

300272	TITLE *300272 HISTONE DEACETYLASE 6; HDAC6
;;KIAA0901
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Histone acetylation (see HAT1; 603053) and deacetylation (see HDAC1;
601241) alternately exposes and occludes DNA to transcription factors.
There are at least 2 classes of HDACs, class I consisting of proteins
homologous to yeast Rpd3 (e.g., HDAC1, HDAC2 (605164), and HDAC3
(605166)) and class II consisting of proteins homologous to yeast Hda1
(e.g., HDAC4; 605314). HDAC6 belongs to class II.

CLONING

Nagase et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA encoding HDAC6, which they called
KIAA0901, from a brain cDNA library. RT-PCR analysis detected HDAC6
expression in all tissues tested, with highest expression in brain and
lowest expression in heart, spleen, and pancreas.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to yeast Hda1,
followed by screening a cDNA library and PCR, Grozinger et al. (1999)
identified cDNAs encoding the class II HDACs HDAC4, HDAC5 (605315), and
HDAC6. Sequence analysis predicted that the 1,216-amino acid HDAC6
protein consists of an apparent internal dimer containing 2 highly
homologous catalytic domains, the first beginning at residue 215 and the
second at residue 610. Northern blot analysis detected expression of a
5.0-kb HDAC6 transcript that was highest in heart, liver, kidney, and
pancreas. Functional analysis confirmed that HDAC6 possesses
deacetylation activity against all 4 core histones and that the 2
catalytic domains function independently. Western blot analysis showed
that HDAC6 is expressed as a 131-kD protein that does not
coimmunoprecipitate with other HDACs or transcription factors. Grozinger
et al. (1999) speculated that HDAC6 may not interact with histones in
vivo but may deacetylate other substrates.

Bertos et al. (2004) determined that the human HDAC6 protein contains 8
consecutive serine- and glutamic acid-containing tetradecapeptide (SE14)
repeats between the second deacetylase domain and the C-terminal
ubiquitin-binding zinc finger. The SE14 domain is not present in
orthologs from C. elegans, Drosophila, and mouse. HDAC6 also contains 2
nuclear export signals and a nuclear localization signal.

GENE FUNCTION

Hubbert et al. (2002) demonstrated that HDAC6 functions as a tubulin
deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where it
associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor
complex (see 601143). In vivo the overexpression of HDAC6 led to a
global deacetylation of alpha-tubulin (see 602529), whereas a decrease
in HDAC6 increased alpha-tubulin acetylation. In vitro, purified HDAC6
potently deacetylated alpha-tubulin in assembled microtubules.
Furthermore, overexpression of HDAC6 promoted chemotactic cell movement,
supporting the idea that HDAC6-mediated deacetylation regulates
microtubule-dependent cell motility. Hubbert et al. (2002) concluded
that HDAC6 is the tubulin deacetylase, and provided evidence that
reversible acetylation regulates important biologic processes beyond
histone metabolism and gene transcription.

Aggregates of misfolded proteins are transported and removed from the
cytoplasm by dynein motors via the microtubule network to an organelle
termed the aggresome, where they are processed. Kawaguchi et al. (2003)
identified HDAC6 as a component of the aggresome in human cells. HDAC6
could bind both polyubiquitinated misfolded proteins and dynein motors,
thereby recruiting misfolded protein cargo to dynein motors for
transport to aggresomes. Cells deficient in HDAC6 failed to clear
misfolded protein aggregates from the cytoplasm, could not form
aggresomes properly, and were hypersensitive to accumulation of
misfolded proteins.

Bertos et al. (2004) determined that the SE14 domain of HDAC6 was
dispensable for the deacetylase and ubiquitin-binding activities of
HDAC6, but it conferred acetyl-microtubule targeting. They further found
that HDAC6 maintained a cytoplasmic distribution in the presence of
leptomycin B, an inhibitor of nuclear export signals, and that the SE14
domain conferred leptomycin B resistance. The SE14 domain formed a
unique structure that caused monomeric HDAC6 to migrate at a molecular
mass of about 500 kD by gel filtration, rather than the predicted mass
of about 150 kD. Bertos et al. (2004) concluded that the cytoplasmic
distribution of HDAC6 is differentially regulated in mice and humans,
and that the SE14 domain serves to stably retain human HDAC6 in the
cytoplasm.

Kovacs et al. (2005) found that inactivation of HDAC6 in human embryonic
kidney cells led to HSP90 (see 140571) hyperacetylation, dissociation of
HSP90 from an essential cochaperone, p23 (607061), and loss of chaperone
activity. In HDAC6-deficient cells, HSP90-dependent maturation of the
glucocorticoid receptor (GCCR; 138040) was compromised, resulting in a
receptor defective in ligand binding, nuclear translocation, and
transcriptional activation. Kovacs et al. (2005) concluded that HSP90 is
a target of HDAC6 and that reversible acetylation is a mechanism that
regulates HSP90 chaperone complex activity.

Pandey et al. (2007) demonstrated in Drosophila that autophagy acts as a
compensatory degradation system when the ubiquitin proteasome system
(UPS) is impaired, and that HDAC6, a microtubule-associated deacetylase
that interacts with polyubiquitinated proteins, is an essential
mechanistic link in this compensatory interaction. The authors found
that compensatory autophagy was induced in response to mutations
affecting the proteasome and in response to UPS impairment in a fly
model of the neurodegenerative disease spinobulbar muscular atrophy.
Autophagy compensated for impaired UPS function in an HDAC6-dependent
manner. Furthermore, expression of HDAC6 was sufficient to rescue
degeneration associated with UPS dysfunction in vivo in an
autophagy-dependent manner. Pandey et al. (2007) concluded that
impairment of autophagy (i.e., associated with aging or genetic
variation) might predispose to neurodegeneration. Moreover, their
findings suggested that it may be possible to intervene in
neurodegeneration by augmenting HDAC6 to enhance autophagy.

Pugacheva et al. (2007) found that AURKA (603072) and its activator HEF1
(NEDD9; 602265) localized to the basal body and the second centriole in
quiescent ciliated human retinal pigment epithelial cells. Association
of AURKA with HEF1 in response to extracellular cues was required for
ciliary disassembly. Activation of AURKA was independently sufficient to
induce rapid ciliary resorption, and AURKA acted in this process through
phosphorylation of HDAC6, leading to HDAC6-dependent tubulin
deacetylation and destabilization of the ciliary axoneme. Small molecule
inhibitors of AURKA and HDAC6 reduced regulated disassembly of cilia.

An immediate response to cell stress is reversible blockade of mRNA
translation. Stalled mRNAs are sequestered into cytoplasmic stress
granules (SGs), which are complex assemblies of initiation factors and
proteins involved in translational control and RNA remodeling or
degradation, as well as 40S ribosome subunits and polyadenylated mRNAs
whose translation has been arrested. Kwon et al. (2007) showed that the
SG protein G3BP (608431) interacted with HDAC6 in vivo and in vitro and
that HDAC6 was recruited to SGs. Inhibition of HDAC led to impaired SG
assembly, and Hdac6-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts failed to form
SGs, although they exhibited normal phosphorylation of Eif2a (609234) in
response to stress. Inactivating mutations in the catalytic domains or
the C-terminal zinc finger domain of HDAC6 impaired SG assembly. Kwon et
al. (2007) also found that HDAC6 was required for cells to recover from
oxidative stress. They proposed that HDAC6 is a central component of the
stress response that regulates SG formation and potentially contributes
to control of RNA metabolism and translation.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Mahlknecht et al. (2001) mapped the HDAC6 gene
to chromosome Xp11.23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Chassaing et al. (2005) reported a 4-generation family segregating an
apparent X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia (300863) with features
including intrauterine growth retardation, hydrocephaly, rhizomelic
shortening, facial dysmorphism, and microphthalmia. Using X-linked
polymorphic microsatellite markers, Simon et al. (2010) performed
linkage analysis in the family described by Chassaing et al. (2005) and
mapped the disease locus to a 24-Mb interval on chromosome Xp11.3-q13.1
(lod = 3.30). By exon sequencing, Simon et al. (2010) identified a
variant in exon 29 of HDAC6, 281 bp after the translation termination
codon (c.*281A>T; 300272.0001) that completely segregated with the
disorder. The variant was located in the sequence corresponding to the
seed sequence of miR433 (611711). Transduction experiments with an HDAC6
3-prime UTR-bearing transgene showed that the mutation abrogated the
posttranscriptional regulation normally exerted by this microRNA.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHONDRODYSPLASIA WITH PLATYSPONDYLY, DISTINCTIVE BRACHYDACTYLY, HYDROCEPHALY,
AND MICROPHTHALMIA (1 family)
HDAC6, 4023A-T

In the 4-generation family with X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia
described by Chassaing et al. (2005), Simon et al. (2010) detected an
A-to-T transversion in exon 29 of the HDAC6 gene, in the 3-prime
untranslated region 281 basepairs after the TAA translation termination
codon (c.*281A-T). The mutation completely cosegregated with the
disorder and was not found in SNP databases or in 100 control
individuals. The variant was located in the sequence corresponding to
the seed sequence of miR433 (611711). In MG63 osteosarcoma cells, miR433
downregulated both the expression of endogenous HDAC6 and that of an
enhanced green fluorescent protein-reporter mRNA bearing the wildtype
3-prime UTR of HDAC6. This effect was totally abrogated when the
reporter mRNA bore the mutated HDAC6 3-prime UTR. The HDAC6 protein was
overexpressed in thymus from an affected male fetus. Concomitantly, the
level of total alpha-tubulin (see 602529), a target of HDAC6, was
increased in the affected fetal thymus, whereas the level of acetylated
alpha-tubulin was profoundly decreased. Skin biopsies from a female
patient with striking body asymmetry expressed a mutated HDAC6 allele in
31% of affected arm-derived fibroblasts, whereas it was not expressed in
the contralateral arm. Overexpression of HDAC6 was also observed in
affected arm-derived fibroblasts. The authors concluded that the HDAC6
3-prime UTR variant suppressed miR433-mediated posttranscriptional
regulation, causing overexpression of HDAC6 and resulting in this form
of X-linked chondrodysplasia.

CML33
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are enzymes that charge tRNAs with specific
amino acids. Cytoplasmic phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase is a heterodimer
consisting of a catalytic alpha subunit, FARSA, and a regulatory beta
subunit, FARSB (609690) (Rodova et al., 1999).

CLONING

Using subtractive hybridization, Sen et al. (1997) identified a gene
that is differentially expressed between a tumorigenic human acute-phase
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; 608232) cell line and its nontumorigenic
variant. Sequence analysis of the predicted 508-amino acid protein,
called CML33, revealed that it has homology to the catalytic subunit of
prokaryotic and S. cerevisiae phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases (PheRS).
Recombinant CML33 reacted with antibodies against sheep liver PheRS on
Western blots. Since CML33 does not have the leader sequence
characteristic of mitochondrial proteins and does not resemble yeast
mitochondrial PheRS, Sen et al. (1997) suggested that it is a subunit of
human cytoplasmic PheRS. Using Northern blot analysis, the authors
determined that CML33 expression is sensitive to the stage of the cell
cycle and to induction of differentiation. Expression of the 1.8-kb
transcript is also substantially enhanced in tumorigenic cells. Sen et
al. (1997) noted that CML33 is the first member of the tRNA synthetase
gene family shown to exhibit this type of regulated expression.

By database analysis, RT-PCR using embryonic kidney cell RNA, and
screening a fetal kidney cDNA library, Rodova et al. (1999) cloned
FARSA. The 508-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 57
kD. Sequence alignment of FARSA orthologs from multiple species showed
conservation of active site regions and suggested that the heterodimer
of FARSA and FARSB forms a 4-helix bundle interface similar to that in
Thermus thermophilus. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.4-kb
transcript in heart, brain, placenta, skeletal muscle, kidney, and
pancreas. Expression was stronger in malignant cell lines compared with
normal tissue.

GENE FUNCTION

Rodova et al. (1999) showed that COS-7 cells transfected with FARSA and
FARSB increase phenylalanine charging of tRNA.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Sen et al. (1997) mapped the
CML33 gene to chromosome 19. Rasooly (1998) noted that the CML33 gene
was contained within genomic clones from chromosomal region 19p13.2
(Genbank GENBANK AD000092).

;;IMMUNOGLOBULIN SUPERFAMILY RECEPTOR TRANSLOCATION-ASSOCIATED GENE
2; IRTA2;;
BXMAS1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chromosomal abnormalities involving translocation breakpoints at
1q21-q23 are frequent in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (see BCL9; 602597)
and multiple myeloma (MM; see 254500). By cloning the breakpoints of a
(1;14)(q21;q32) chromosomal translocation in the FR4 multiple myeloma
cell line, followed by exon trapping and screening a spleen cDNA
library, Hatzivassiliou et al. (2001) obtained cDNAs encoding 3 isoforms
of IRTA1 (605876) and 4 isoforms of IRTA2. The 3 major IRTA2 mRNA
isoforms (ITRA2A, ITRA2B, and ITRA2C) each have their own unique 3-prime
untranslated region, and the proteins they encode share a common amino
acid sequence until residue 560, including a signal peptide and 6
extracellular Ig-type domains. Sequence analysis predicted that IRTA2A
is a 759-amino acid secreted glycoprotein with 8 total extracellular
Ig-type domains followed by 13 unique, predominantly polar residues at
its C terminus. After the common 560 amino acids, IRTA2B has only 32
additional residues, whose hydrophobicity is compatible with its docking
to the plasma membrane via a GPI anchor. The 977-amino acid IRTA2C
protein shares the first 746 amino acids with IRTA2A. IRTA2C has a total
of 9 extracellular Ig-type domains with 8 potential N-linked
glycosylation sites; a 23-residue transmembrane region; and a
104-residue cytoplasmic domain with 3 consensus SH2-binding domains, all
of which exhibit features of ITIMs (immune-receptor tyrosine-based
inhibition motifs) and are encoded by separate exons. The fourth
isoform, IRTA2D, encodes a peptide of 152 amino acids. Northern blot
analysis detected 2.8-, 4.4-, 5.3-, and 0.6-kb IRTA2 transcripts in
lymph node, spleen, bone marrow, and small intestine, with a
preponderance of the IRTA2A isoform. In situ hybridization analysis
detected IRTA2 expression in tonsillar germinal center centrocytes, but
not in centroblasts, as well as in intraepithelial and interfollicular
regions.

Nakayama et al. (2001) independently cloned IRTA2, which they called
BXMAS1, by representational difference analysis of genes activated by
anti-IgM crosslinking of a human B-cell line. The deduced 977-amino acid
protein contains 8 ITIMs and 8 potential N-linked glycosylation sites.
Northern blot analysis detected a 6.7-kb transcript and a larger
transcript between 14- and 17-kb in B cells 24 to 36 hours after
activation. Northern blot analysis of tissues detected expression only
in spleen In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated expression of
IRTA2 in the mantle zone of tonsil tissue but not in germinal center
cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using FISH and Northern blot analysis, Hatzivassiliou et al. (2001)
determined that Burkitt lymphoma (BL; see 113970) cell lines with 1q21
abnormalities frequently overexpress the IRTA2 gene. However, in BL cell
lines with normal 1q21 chromosomes and in germinal center centroblasts,
from which BLs derive, IRTA2 expression was undetectable. Hatzivassiliou
et al. (2001) concluded that IRTA2 expression is frequently deregulated
in BLs with 1q21 chromosomal aberrations.

Orthopoxvirus MHC class I-like protein (OMCP) binds with high affinity
to NKG2D (KLRK1; 611817) on NK and T cells. Campbell et al. (2010)
showed that OMCP also bound to human and mouse monocytes and B cells,
which lack NKG2D. Using flow cytometric analysis, they demonstrated
binding of OMCP to mouse Fcrl5, which is highly expressed by B cells.
Campbell et al. (2010) suggested that FCRL5 and B lymphocytes are
involved in defense against zoonotic poxviruses.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nakayama et al. (2001) determined that the IRTA2 gene contains 16 exons
spanning 58 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hatzivassiliou et al. (2001) determined
that the IRTA1 and IRTA2 genes are separated by 21 kb on chromosome 1q21
and are transcribed in the same orientation. Furthermore, the IRTA1 and
IRTA2 genes form a contig on 1q21 with additional IRTA-related genes
(IRTA3, IRTA4, and IRTA5) and are telomeric to the MUC1 gene (158340)
and centromeric to the FCGR2B gene (604590).

609038	TITLE *609038 RHO FAMILY GTPase 1; RND1
;;RHO6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the Rho GTPase family, such as RND1, regulate the
organization of the actin cytoskeleton in response to extracellular
growth factors (Nobes et al., 1998).

CLONING

By screening a human fetal brain cDNA library using bovine Rnd1 as
probe, Nobes et al. (1998) cloned RND1. The deduced protein contains 232
amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 26 kD. It contains 3
guanine-binding motifs, 2 loops and a threonine involved in phosphate
binding, and 3 major residues that coordinate magnesium in the GTP-bound
state. However, RND1 lacks the residues important for the intrinsic
GTPase activity of RAS (see 190020). RND1 ends with a CAAX box motif and
a terminal methionine residue, suggesting that RND1 is farnesylated.
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.9-kb RND1 transcript expressed at
highest levels in adult and fetal brain and liver, with little to no
expression in other tissues examined. Within specific brain regions,
RND1 expression was highest in cortex, occipital pole, and frontal and
temporal lobes. Immunohistochemical staining of rat brain found highest
Rnd1 protein in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, granule neurons
of dentate gyrus, and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Endogenous mouse
Rnd1 localized in adherens junctions of confluent fibroblast cultures.

GENE FUNCTION

Nobes et al. (1998) showed that RND1 exchanges GTP faster and has a much
lower affinity for GDP that most other small G proteins, but it has no
intrinsic GTPase activity. Expression of RND1 in fibroblasts inhibited
the formation of actin stress fibers, membrane ruffles, and
integrin-based focal adhesions, and it induced loss of cell-substrate
adhesion, leading to cell rounding.

Aoki et al. (2000) found that expression of human RND1 in rat
pheochromocytoma cells disrupted the cortical actin filaments and caused
the formation of many neuritic processes from the cell body. The
processes had microtubules but few filamentous actin and neurofilaments.
An inhibitor of actin polymerization mimicked the effects of RND1
overexpression. Process formation induced by RND1 was inhibited by
dominant-negative RAC1 (602048).

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, in vitro protein binding assays, and
pull-down experiments with a breast cancer cell line, Vayssiere et al.
(2000) showed that RND1 interacts with GRB7 (601522). They determined
that the interaction involves the switch II loop of RND1, a region
crucial for guanine nucleotide exchange in all GTPases, and an SH2
domain of GRB7, a region crucial for GRB7 interaction with several
activated receptors.

MAPPING

By FISH, Nobes et al. (1998) mapped the RND1 gene to chromosome
12q12-q13.

601310	TITLE *601310 CYTOCHROME P450, SUBFAMILY IVA, POLYPEPTIDE 11; CYP4A11
;;OMEGA-HYDROXYLASE, FATTY ACID;;
CYP4AII
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The human P450 enzymes encoded by CYP4 genes (see 124075) represent a
distinct lineage of the P450 family. The CYP4A subfamily is involved in
the metabolism of medium- and long-chain fatty acids (Cho et al., 2005).

CLONING

Palmer et al. (1993) noted that mammalian CYP4A enzymes catalyze
selective hydroxylation of a primary carbon-hydrogen bond in medium- and
long-chain fatty acids. Palmer et al. (1993) cloned and characterized a
CYP4A-encoding gene, designated CYP4AII, by screening a human kidney
cDNA library using a rabbit CYP4A cDNA probe. By Northern and RNase
protection analysis, they showed that the gene is expressed
predominantly in kidney and somewhat in liver.

Bell et al. (1993) cloned human, mouse, and guinea pig CYP4A cDNAs,
including human CYP4A11.

Kawashima et al. (1994) purified CYP4A fatty acid omega-hydroxylase,
named P450HL-omega by them, from human liver. They cloned a CYP4A11 cDNA
by screening a human liver cDNA library with a rabbit CYP4A5 cDNA. The
CYP4A11 cDNA encodes a predicted 519-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of 59.4 kD. The deduced sequence of residues 5
through 25 was identical to the N-terminal amino acid sequence of
purified P450HL-omega, except for 1 undetermined residue. By Western
blot analysis of transfected yeast microsomes, Kawashima et al. (1994)
detected a specific protein with a mass of 52 kD, which is identical to
that of purified P450HL-omega. Northern blot analysis showed that
CYP4A11 is expressed as a 2.6-kb transcript.

Imaoka et al. (1993) cloned a variant cDNA of CYP4A11, termed CYP4A11v,
from a human kidney cDNA library. The CYP4A11v cDNA contains a deletion
of a single adenine residue, resulting in a frameshift and the
production of a predicted 591-amino acid protein. Several differences in
the 3-prime untranslated region of the CYP4A11v cDNA were also detected.
Baculovirus-mediated expression of the CYP4A11v cDNA yielded an unstable
protein that did not efficiently metabolize lauric acid.

Using PCR analysis, Savas et al. (2003) found that both CYP4A11 and
CYP4A22 (615341) were expressed in 100 human liver tissue samples.
Quantitative real-time PCR of 7 samples revealed that the enzymes were
independently and variably expressed and that expression of CYP4A11 was
significantly higher than that of CYP4A22.

GENE FUNCTION

Palmer et al. (1993) characterized the catalytic activity of expressed
recombinant CYP4A11 on various fatty acids and prostaglandins and
concluded that the enzyme is a fatty acid omega-hydroxylase with
turnover numbers of 9.8, 2.2, and 0.55 per min for lauric, palmitic, and
arachidonic acids, respectively.

Powell et al. (1996) demonstrated that CYP4A11 is the principal lauric
acid omega-hydroxylase expressed in human liver.

Pikuleva and Waterman (2013) stated that CYP4A11 and CYP4A22 (615341)
oxidize arachidonic acid to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in the
endoplasmic reticulum of kidney tubules.

Savas et al. (2003) found that expression of CYP4A11 was undetectable in
subconfluent human hepatoma HepG2 cells expressing human PPAR-alpha
(PPARA; 170998) or a murine Ppar-alpha mutant with compromised
ligand-dependent transactivation. However, upon attaining confluence,
CYP4A11, but not CYP4A22, was upregulated in HepG2 cells expressing
mutant Ppar-alpha following exposure to a Ppar-alpha agonist.
Dexamethasone also induced CYP4A11, but not CYP4A22, expression, and
dexamethasone-induced CYP4A11 was independent of PPAR-alpha.

MAPPING

Bell et al. (1993) mapped the human CYP4A11 gene to chromosome 1 by PCR
of somatic cell hybrid DNAs.

By genomic sequence analysis, Nelson et al. (2004 ) mapped the CYP4A11
gene to a cluster of cytochrome P450 genes on chromosome 1p33.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Cho et al. (2005) presented 70 genetic variants of the CYP4A11 gene
identified in 24 DNA samples from the Korean population. Sixty variants
were intronic.

- Association with Essential Hypertension

Gainer et al. (2005) screened the CYP4A11 gene and identified 9 variants
with allelic frequencies greater than 1%, among them an 8590C-T
transition in exon 11 resulting in a phe434-to-ser (F434S) substitution.
Functional studies revealed that the ser434 replacement reduced by more
than half the 20-HETE synthase activity of CYP4A11. In a population of
392 white individuals from Tennessee, Gainer et al. (2005) found that
the age, BMI, and gender-adjusted odds ratio of hypertension (see
145500) attributable to the 8590C variant was 2.31 compared with the
reference 8590TT genotype. In 1,538 individuals from the Framingham
Heart Study, the adjusted odds ratio of hypertension associated with the
8590C variant was 1.23, and it was 1.33 when individuals with diabetes
were excluded. The variant was not associated with hypertension in a
population of 120 black individuals.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nakagawa et al. (2006) created mice lacking Cyp4a10, an ortholog of
human CYP4A11. Homozygous mutant mice developed normally and lacked
obvious symptoms of disease or organ malformation, and disruption of the
Cyp4a10 gene had little or no effect on kidney morphology or renal
function before or after animal salt loading. Cyp4a10-null mice fed a
low-salt diet were normotensive, but they became hypertensive when fed
normal or high-salt diets. Hypertensive Cyp4a10-null mice had a
dysfunctional kidney epithelial sodium channel (see SCNN1D; 601328) and
became normotensive when administered amiloride, a selective inhibitor
of this channel. Nakagawa et al. (2006) concluded that arachidonate
monooxygenases alter renal sodium reabsorption and blood pressure and
have a direct role in the gating activity of the kidney epithelial
sodium channel.

Using transgenic mice expressing human CYP4A11, Savas et al. (2009)
confirmed that expression of CYP4A11 was regulated by Ppar-alpha.
Fasting or dietary administration of a PPAR-alpha agonist increased
hepatic and renal CYP4A11 expression, and these responses were abrogated
in Ppar-alpha -/- mice. Basal liver CYP4A11 levels were reduced
differentially in Ppar-alpha -/- females (over 95%) and males (less than
50%). In Ppar-alpha -/- males, continuous infusion of growth hormone
(see GH1, 139250) to mimic the female growth hormone pattern reduced
expression of CYP4A11 to near female levels. Treatment with growth
hormone decreased expression of CYP4A11 equally in both male and female
wildtype mice.

NOMENCLATURE

The gene encoding this enzyme has also been called CYP4A2, which is
presumably a derivation of CYP4AII.

185641	TITLE *185641 MEDIATOR COMPLEX SUBUNIT 22; MED22
;;SURFEIT 5; SURF5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MED22, or SURF5, is a component of the Mediator complex, which is a
coactivator for DNA-binding factors that activate transcription via RNA
polymerase II (Sato et al., 2003). For background information on the
surfeit genes, see SURF1 (185620).

CLONING

Garson et al. (1996) stated that the mouse Surf5 protein contains 140
amino acids and is 98.5% identical to the human SURF5 protein. By
screening mouse brain and human fetal brain cDNA libraries, they cloned
a splice variant of SURF5 that they called SURF5B. Both mouse and human
SURF5B encode a deduced 200-amino acid protein that is identical to
SURF5 over the first 137 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected
Surf5 expression in all mouse tissues examined, whereas expression of
Surf5b was restricted to brain, heart, testis, and skeletal muscle. Both
mouse proteins were recovered in the cytoplasmic fraction of transfected
cells.

By PCR of a human teratocarcinoma cell line cDNA library, Angiolillo et
al. (2002) obtained 3 splice variants of SURF5. The longest cDNA,
SURF5a, encodes a deduced 140-amino acid protein with a calculated
molecular mass of 16.7 kD. SURF5b encodes a deduced 200-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 21 kD. The first 137 amino
acids of both proteins are identical. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected a 2.7-kb SURF5a transcript in all tissues and cell
lines examined. A 1.4-kb SURF5b transcript was detected only in heart,
brain, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, and in human teratocarcinoma
cells. Fluorescence-tagged SURF5a and SURF5b localized predominantly to
the cytoplasm of transfected HeLa cells.

Using HeLa cells overexpressing epitope-tagged MED10 (612382), Sato et
al. (2003) purified several components of the human Mediator complex,
including MED22, which they called SURF5, and subsequently cloned the
corresponding cDNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Garson et al. (1996) found that both mouse Surf5 and Surf5b were
expressed in undifferentiated mouse teratocarcinoma cells, but that
expression of Surf5b was upregulated 4-fold following their
differentiation into neuronal cells.

Using in vitro-translated epitope-tagged proteins for protein-binding
assays, Sato et al. (2003) found SURF5 directly interacted with the
Mediator complex subunits TRAP25 (MED30; 610237), HSPC296 (MED11;
612383), TRAP80 (MED17; 603810), and TRAP37 (MED27; 605044). Formation
of the SURF5-HSPC296 and SURF5-TRAP25 heterodimers were confirmed by
coimmunoprecipitation analysis of cotransfected insect cells and E.
coli, respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Angiolillo et al. (2002) determined that the MED22 gene contains 5 exons
and spans about 7.5 kb. The transcription start sites of the MED22 and
SURF3 (RPL7A; 185640) genes are separated by a 110-bp region that showed
bidirectional promoter activity. This promoter region lacks a TATA box
but is characterized by a CpG island that extends through the first exon
into the first intron of both genes.

MAPPING

By FISH analysis, Yon et al. (1993) identified the MED22 gene within the
surfeit gene cluster in chromosome 9q34.

182880	TITLE *182880 SPERM PROTAMINE P1; PRM1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Protamines are small, arginine-rich, nuclear proteins that replace
histones (e.g., 142709) late in the haploid phase of spermatogenesis and
are believed essential for sperm head condensation and DNA
stabilization. Mice, humans, and certain fish have 2 or more different
protamines, whereas the sperm of bull, boar, rat, rabbit, guinea pig,
and ram have one form of protamine. The 2 human protamines are denoted
P1 and P2 (PRM2; 182890). The amino acid sequence of both has been
determined (Ammer et al., 1986). Of the 50 amino acid residues of P1, 24
are arginines and 6 are cysteines. Ammer et al. (1986) found 2 forms of
P2 that differ by the presence in one of 3 additional amino acids at the
N terminus. Of the 57 residues of the longer form, 27 are arginines and
5 are cysteines. The nucleotide sequence of the 2 mouse protamine cDNAs
predict markedly different amino acid sequences, a conclusion in
agreement with data on amino acid composition and on electrophoretic
mobility.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krawetz et al. (1989) showed that there is a single copy of the human P1
protamine gene, that the mRNA is approximately 450 bases long, and that
the gene contains an intron.

Domenjoud et al. (1990) showed that both PRM1 and PRM2 have a single
intron, consisting of 91 and 163 bp, respectively. Both genes were found
to contain typical TATAA and CAAT boxes at conventional distances from
the transcription start points which, by use of primary extension
experiments, were assigned to nucleotides -91 and -110 for PRM1 and
PRM2, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Choudhary et al. (1995) referred to the linear array of PRM1, which they
stated is located on 16p13.2, as a multigenic locus. To study the
mechanisms that govern expression in the male gamete, they constructed a
transgenic mouse model. A segment of human chromosome 16 harboring the
PRM1--PRM2--TNP2 gene cluster was introduced into fertilized mouse eggs.
This 40,255-bp fragment contained sufficient information to express
faithfully all the members of this multigene family in a copy
number-dependent but position-independent manner in the heterologous
system. A DNase I-sensitive domain of approximately 28.5 kb encompassing
the human gene cluster was bounded by an array of topoisomerase II
consensus sites. These results established that, like somatic cells, the
genes transcribed by the male gamete are organized at specific loci as
functional domains. The concept that transcriptionally competent
chromatin assumes an altered nuclear structure had been validated for
somatic cells when it was shown that the beta-globin gene (141900)
acquired a DNase I-sensitive conformation within cells in which it was
expressed. Choudhary et al. (1995) found that the 28.5-kb segment
containing the 3 genes integrated into independent chromosomal sites
while maintaining its fidelity of transcription. All members of the
cluster were expressed in proportion similar to those in human testis.
Furthermore, DNase I sensitivity established that in sperm the gene
domain is bounded by an array of nuclear matrix-associated topoisomerase
II (126430) consensus sites. This was the first description of a
multigenic male gamete-specific domain as a fundamental gene regulatory
unit.

Protamines, the major DNA-binding proteins in the nucleus of sperm in
most vertebrates, package the DNA in a volume less than 5% of a somatic
cell nucleus. Many mammals have one protamine, but a few species,
including humans and mice, have 2. Cho et al. (2001) used gene targeting
to determine if the second protamine provides redundancy to an essential
process, or if both protamines are necessary. They disrupted the coding
sequence of 1 allele of either Prm1 or Prm2 in embryonic stem (ES) cells
derived from 129-strain mice, and injected them into blastocysts from
C57BL/6-strain mice. Male chimeras produced 129-genotype sperm with
disrupted Prm1 or Prm2 alleles, but failed to sire offspring carrying
the 129 genome. They also found that a decrease in the amount of either
protamine disrupted nuclear formation, processing of protamine-2, and
normal sperm function. Their studies indicated that both protamines are
essential and that haploinsufficiency caused by a mutation in 1 allele
of either gene prevents genetic transmission of both mutant and wildtype
alleles.

MAPPING

From studies of hamster/mouse hybrids, Hecht et al. (1986) found that
both of the protamines of mice are coded by chromosome 16. Perhaps the
synteny permits coordinate regulation. These may be genes that are
expressed in the haploid state.

Reeves et al. (1987, 1987) also found that the protamine-1 locus is on
chromosome 16 of the mouse. By linkage studies, Reeves et al. (1987,
1989) showed that Prm1 is located near the proximal end of mouse
chromosome 16. No recombinants between Prm1 and Prm2 were found. In the
Chinese hamster, furthermore, probes specific for Prm1 and Prm2
hybridized to the same restriction fragment after digestion of hamster
genomic DNA with any of 5 different restriction endonucleases.

By studies in rodent/human cell hybrids, Reeves et al. (1987, 1989)
demonstrated that PRM1 is located on chromosome 16 in humans.

Krawetz et al. (1989) mapped the human PRM1 gene to chromosome 16q21 by
a combination of somatic cell hybrid studies and in situ hybridization.
By in situ hybridization, Engel (1990) found that PRM1 and PRM2 are in
the same 4.8-kb fragment and map to 16p13.3. Viguie et al. (1990) found,
also by in situ hybridization, that both PRM1 and PRM2 map to 16p13.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Iguchi et al. (2006) analyzed the PRM1 gene in 30 unrelated infertile
men and 10 men of pregnancy-proven fertility. In 3 of the infertile men,
they identified heterozygosity for a 197G-T SNP, predicted to result in
an arg34-to-ser (R34S) substitution in a highly conserved arginine
cluster. The authors noted that this appeared to be an uncommon SNP, as
it was not found in 522 men from previous studies (270 fertile, 226
sterile, and 26 unselected) nor in 220 individuals from 2 SNP databases.
Kichine et al. (2008) screened 361 infertile and 672 fertile men for the
197G-T SNP, which they designated 102G-T, and found 3 heterozygotes, 2
from the fertile group and 1 who had obstructive infertility (agenesis
of the vas deferens). Another SNP in the PRM1 gene, a -107G-C
transversion, was not found in any of the 672 fertile men but in 2 of
192 infertile men, both of sub-Saharan African origin; however, in a
screening of unselected samples from similar regions, 3 of 95 Comorian
men and 12 of 67 Congolese men were found to be 107C carriers. Kichine
et al. (2008) concluded that neither SNP has a significant effect on
male fertility.

ANIMAL MODEL

Okada et al. (2007) used a loss-of-function approach to demonstrate that
the mouse H3K9me2/1-specific demethylase Jhdm2a (611512) is essential
for spermatogenesis. They showed that Jhdm2a-deficient mice exhibit
postmeiotic chromatin condensation defects, and that Jhdm2a directly
binds to and controls the expression of transition nuclear protein-1
(TNP1; 190231) and PRM1 genes, the products of which are required for
packaging and condensation of sperm chromatin. Thus, Okada et al. (2007)
concluded that their work uncovered a role for JHDM2A in spermatogenesis
and revealed transition nuclear protein and protamine genes as direct
targets of JHDM2A.

600140	TITLE *600140 CREB-BINDING PROTEIN; CREBBP
;;CBP
CBP/MOZ FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

When cellular levels of cAMP increase, a cascade of events leads to the
induction of genes that contain cis-regulatory elements called
cAMP-response elements (CREs). Elevated cAMP levels cause stimulation
and nuclear translocation of protein kinase A (PKA; see 176911), which
activates the transcription factor CREB (CRE-binding protein; see
123810) by phosphorylating it at a single residue, serine-133 (Gonzalez
and Montminy, 1989).

Chrivia et al. (1993) reported the discovery of a nuclear
transcriptional coactivator protein, CREB-binding protein (CBP), that
binds specifically to the PKA-phosphorylated form of the CREB protein.
CBP is a large protein with a molecular mass of about 250 kD which
contains a bromodomain, i.e., a conserved structural unit important for
protein-protein interactions. In Drosophila and yeast, this domain is
found in coactivator proteins involved in signal-dependent, but not
basal, transcription (Nordheim, 1994).

To isolate the gene responsible for Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS1;
180849), which is associated with breakpoints in and microdeletions of
chromosome 16p13.3, Petrij et al. (1995) used FISH to situate all RSTS
breakpoints in an area of 150 kb, thus defining a candidate region.
Complementary DNAs from this area showed very high sequence homology
with mouse CBP. Further studies indicated that the human CBP gene spans
at least the 150-kb genomic area containing the RSTS breakpoints. Giles
et al. (1997) reported the cloning and sequencing of human CREBBP, which
encodes a deduced 2,442-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 265
kD with 95% homology to the mouse protein.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Liu et al. (2008) described a high resolution x-ray crystal structure of
a semisynthetic heterodimeric p300 (602700) HAT domain in complex with a
bisubstrate inhibitor, Lys-CoA. This structure showed that p300/CBP is a
distant cousin of other structurally characterized HATs, but revealed
several novel features that explain the broad substrate specificity and
preference for nearby basic residues. Based on this structure and
accompanying biochemical data, Liu et al. (2008) proposed that p300/CBP
uses an unusual hit-and-run (Theorell-Chance) catalytic mechanism that
is distinct from other characterized HATs. Several disease-associated
mutations could also be readily accounted for by the p300 HAT structure.

MAPPING

Petrij et al. (1995) used FISH to show that mouse CBP hybridized to
human 16p13.3. Chen and Korenberg (1995) also mapped CREBBP to 16p13.3
using a cDNA probe for the mouse gene in fluorescence in situ
hybridization. Using a human genomic clone for FISH, Wydner et al.
(1995) mapped CREBBP to 16p13.3-p13.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Kwok et al. (1994) used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to define
the equilibrium binding parameters of the phosphoCREB:CBP interaction
and reported that CBP can activate transcription through a region in its
C terminus. The activation domain of CBP interacts directly with the
basal transcription factor TFIIB (189963). As TFIIB interacts with the
TATA-box-binding protein TBP1 (186852), a continuous chain of physical
contacts is established linking the stimulus-activated phosphoCREB,
bound distal to the promoter, with the polymerase II complex that
initiates transcription (Nordheim, 1994). Acting as a coactivator, CBP
augments the activity of phosphorylated CREB to activate transcription
of cAMP-responsive genes.

Arias et al. (1994) microinjected an anti-CBP antiserum into fibroblasts
and determined that transcription from a cAMP promoter can be inhibited.
Arias et al. (1994) also reported that CBP cooperates with upstream
activators, such as JUN (165160), that are involved in
mitogen-responsive transcription. Studies indicated that when JUN was
phosphorylated at the transcriptionally stimulatory sites ser73 and
ser63, it bound CBP with comparable affinity to CREB. They proposed that
CBP is recruited to the promoter through interaction with certain
phosphorylated factors and that CBP may thus play a critical role in the
transmission of inductive signals from cell surface receptors to the
transcriptional apparatus.

Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs; e.g., 184756)
activate transcription of genes whose products are involved in the
cellular uptake and synthesis of cholesterol. Oliner et al. (1996)
showed that the putative activation domain of SREBP binds specifically
to the N-terminal domains of recombinant CBP and p300 (EP300; 602700), a
CREBBP-related protein. Transfection studies demonstrated that CBP
enhances the ability of SREBP to activate transcription of reporter
genes in HeLa cells, thus suggesting that CBP may serve as a coactivator
for SREBP.

Weaver et al. (1998) identified CREBBP/EP300 and IRF3 (603734) as
components of DRAF1 (double-stranded RNA-activated factor-1), a positive
regulator of interferon-stimulated gene transcription that functions as
a direct response to viral infection.

Lin et al. (2001) identified a compactly folded 46-residue domain in CBP
and p300, the IRF3-binding domain (IBID), and determined its structure
by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. IBID has a helical framework
containing an apparently flexible polyglutamine loop that participates
in ligand binding. Spectroscopic data indicated that induced folding
accompanies association of IBID with its partners, which exhibit no
evident sequence similarities. IBID is an important contributor to
signal integration by CBP and p300.

CBP binds to the ser133 phosphorylated region of CREB via a domain
called KIX (Parker et al., 1996). The phosphorylated domain of CREB was
termed KID for kinase-inducible domain. Radhakrishnan et al. (1997) used
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the molecular
interactions of the KIX:KID domains of CBP and CREB, respectively. The
KIX domain of CBP comprises amino acid residues 586 to 666. The KID
domain of CREB comprises amino acid residues 101 to 160. The KID
undergoes a coil-to-helix folding transition upon binding to KIX,
forming 2 alpha helices. The amphipathic helix alpha-B of KID interacts
with a hydrophobic groove defined by helices alpha-1 and alpha-3 of KIX.
The other KID helix, alpha-A, contacts a different face of the alpha-3
helix. The phosphate group of the critical phosphoserine residue of KID
forms a hydrogen bond to the side chain of tyr658 of KIX. The structure
provides a model for interactions between other transactivation domains
and their targets.

Growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530) and insulin
(176730) regulate development and metabolism via genes containing both
POU homeodomain (PIT1; 173110) and phorbol ester (AP1, or JNK) response
elements. Although CBP functions as a coactivator on these elements, the
mechanism of transactivation was unclear. Zanger et al. (2001)
demonstrated that CBP is recruited to these elements only after it is
phosphorylated at ser436 by growth factor-dependent signaling pathways.
In contrast, p300, a protein closely related to CBP that lacks this
phosphorylation site, binds only weakly to the transcription complex and
in a growth factor-independent manner. A small region of CBP (amino
acids 312 to 440), which the authors termed the GF box, contains a
potent transactivation domain and mediates this effect. Direct
phosphorylation represents a novel mechanism controlling coactivator
recruitment to the transcription complex.

To determine the physiologic significance of the phosphorylation site at
ser436 of the CREBBP protein, Zhou et al. (2004) generated knockin mice
containing a ser436-to-ala mutation. They demonstrated both in vitro and
in vivo that the mutant CREBBP was aberrantly recruited to CREB protein,
resulting in inappropriate activation of gluconeogenesis in the fed
state and glucose intolerance resulting from increased hepatic glucose
production. Zhou et al. (2004) proposed that insulin signaling may
directly regulate many cAMP signaling pathways at the transcriptional
level by controlling CREBBP recruitment.

To elucidate the molecular basis of assembling the multiprotein
activation complex, Demarest et al. (2002) undertook a structural and
thermodynamic analysis of the interaction domains of CBP and the
activator for thyroid hormone and retinoid receptors (TRAM1; 601937).
Demarest et al. (2002) demonstrated that although the isolated domains
are intrinsically disordered, they combine with high affinity to form a
cooperatively folded helical heterodimer. The authors concluded that
their study uncovers a unique mechanism, which they termed 'synergistic
folding,' through which p160 coactivators recruit CBP to allow
transmission of the hormone signal to the transcriptional machinery.

Zhong et al. (2002) demonstrated that transcriptionally inactive nuclear
NFKB in resting cells consists of homodimers of either p65 (164014) or
p50 (164011) complexed with the histone deacetylase HDAC1 (601241). Only
the p50-HDAC1 complexes bound to DNA and suppressed NFKB-dependent gene
expression in unstimulated cells. Appropriate stimulation caused nuclear
localization of NFKB complexes containing phosphorylated p65 that
associated with CBP and displaced the p50-HDAC1 complexes. These results
demonstrated that phosphorylation of p65 determines whether it
associates with either CBP or HDAC1, ensuring that only p65 entering the
nucleus from cytoplasmic NFKB-IKB (164008) complexes can activate
transcription.

TDG (601423) initiates repair of G/T and G/U mismatches, commonly
associated with CpG islands, by removing thymine and uracil moieties.
Tini et al. (2002) reported that TDG associates with transcriptional
coactivators CBP and p300 (602700) and that the resulting complexes are
competent for both the excision step of repair and histone acetylation.
TDG stimulated CBP transcriptional activity in transfected cells and
reciprocally served as a substrate for CBP/p300 acetylation. This
acetylation triggered release of CBP from DNA ternary complexes and also
regulated recruitment of repair endonuclease APE (107748). These
observations revealed a potential regulatory role for protein
acetylation in base mismatch repair and a role for CBP/p300 in
maintaining genomic stability.

Huntington disease (HD; 143100) belongs to the CAG repeat family of
neurodegenerative diseases and is characterized by the presence of an
expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat in the huntingtin gene (HTT;
613004). PolyQ-expanded htt accumulates within large aggregates that are
found in various subcellular compartments, but are more often localized
within the nucleus. It has been suggested that the sequestration of
proteins essential to cell viability may be 1 mechanism that accounts
for toxicity generated by polyQ-expanded proteins. Nuclear inclusions
containing polyQ-expanded htt have been shown to recruit CREBBP. In a
hippocampal cell line, Jiang et al. (2003) found that toxicity within
individual cells induced by polyQ-expanded htt (as revealed by a TUNEL
assay) was associated with the localization of the mutant htt within
either nuclear or perinuclear aggregates. However, in addition to CREBBP
recruitment, CREBBP ubiquitylation and degradation were selectively
enhanced by polyQ-expanded htt. Jiang et al. (2003) concluded that
selected substrates may be directed to the
ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent protein degradation pathway in response
to polyQ-expanded htt within the nucleus.

Tsuda et al. (2003) found that SOX9 (608160) used CBP and p300 as
transcriptional coactivators. SOX9 bound CBP and p300 in vitro and in
vivo, and both coactivators enhanced SOX9-dependent COL2A1 (120140)
promoter activity. Disruption of the CBP-SOX9 complex inhibited COL2A1
mRNA expression and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells into
chondrocytes.

Blobel et al. (1998) found that in mouse nonhematopoietic cells, Cbp
stimulated Gata1 (305371) transcriptional activity. Cbp and Gata1 also
coimmunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts of mouse erythroid cells.
Interaction mapping pinpointed the contact sites to the zinc finger
region of Gata1 and to the E1A-binding region of Cbp. Expression of
adenovirus E1A revealed that the interaction of Cbp with Gata1 in
erythroid cells affected differentiation and expression of endogenous
Gata1 target genes.

Turnell et al. (2005) showed that 2 anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome
(APC/C) components, APC5 (606948) and APC7 (606949), interact directly
with the coactivators CBP and p300 through protein-protein interaction
domains that are evolutionarily conserved in adenovirus E1A. This
interaction stimulates intrinsic CBP/p300 acetyltransferase activity and
potentiates CBP/p300-dependent transcription. Turnell et al. (2005) also
showed that APC5 and APC7 suppress E1A-mediated transformation in a
CBP/p300-dependent manner, indicating that these components of the APC/C
may be targeted during cellular transformation. Furthermore, Turnell et
al. (2005) established that CBP is required for APC/C function;
specifically, gene ablation of CBP by RNA-mediated interference markedly
reduces the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the APC/C and the
progression of cells through mitosis. Taken together, Turnell et al.
(2005) concluded that their results define discrete roles for the
APC/C-CBP/p300 complexes in growth regulation.

Wang et al. (2008) showed that an RNA-binding protein, TLS (137070),
serves as a key transcriptional regulatory sensor of DNA damage signals
that, on the basis of its allosteric modulation by RNA, specifically
binds to and inhibits CBP and p300 histone acetyltransferase activities
on a repressed gene target, cyclin D1 (CCND1; 168461), in human cell
lines. Recruitment of TLS to the CCND1 promoter to cause gene-specific
repression is directed by single-stranded, low copy-number noncoding RNA
(ncRNA) transcripts tethered to the 5-prime regulatory regions of CCND1
that are induced in response to DNA damage signals. Wang et al. (2008)
suggested that signal-induced noncoding RNAs localized to regulatory
regions of transcription units can act cooperatively as selective
ligands, recruiting and modulating the activities of distinct classes of
RNA-binding coregulators in response to specific signals, providing an
unexpected noncoding RNA/RNA-binding protein-based strategy to integrate
transcriptional programs.

Das et al. (2009) demonstrated that the histone acetyltransferase CBP in
flies, and CBP and p300 in humans, acetylate histone H3 on lys56
(H3K56), whereas Drosophila sir2 and human SIRT1 (604479) and SIRT2
(604480) deacetylate H3K56 acetylation. The histone chaperones ASF1A
(609189) in humans and Asf1 in Drosophila are required for acetylation
of H3K56 in vivo, whereas the histone chaperone CAF1 (see 601245) in
humans and Caf1 in Drosophila are required for the incorporation of
histones bearing this mark into chromatin. Das et al. (2009) showed
that, in response to DNA damage, histones bearing acetylated K56 are
assembled into chromatin in Drosophila and human cells, forming foci
that colocalize with sites of DNA repair. Furthermore, acetylation of
H3K56 is increased in multiple types of cancer, correlating with
increased levels of ASF1A in these tumors. Das et al. (2009) concluded
that their identification of multiple proteins regulating the levels of
H3K56 acetylation in metazoans will allow future studies of this
critical and unique histone modification that couples chromatin assembly
to DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, and cancer.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Acute Myelogenous Leukemia

Petrij et al. (1995) noted a case of acute myeloid leukemia (601626)
type M5b reported by Wessels et al. (1991) that was associated with a
translocation t(8;16) whose breakpoint was located in the same region as
the breakpoints in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome-1 (RSTS1; 180849) (see
below). Petrij et al. (1995) proposed that the translocation may have
joined CBP to an unknown gene on chromosome 8, leading to the
malignancy.

By positional cloning on chromosome 16, Borrow et al. (1996) implicated
the CREB-binding protein in the M4/M5 subtype of acute myeloid leukemia.
Borrow et al. (1996) also used positional cloning to identify a novel
gene at the chromosome 8 breakpoint, which they termed MOZ (601408) for
monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein.

Sobulo et al. (1997) stated that the recurring translocation
t(11;16)(q23;p13.3) has been observed only in cases of acute leukemia or
myelodysplasia secondary to therapy with drugs targeting DNA
topoisomerase II (126430). Sobulo et al. (1997) showed that in 2
patients the MLL gene was fused in-frame to a different exon of the
CREBBP gene, producing chimeric proteins containing the AT-hooks,
methyltransferase homology domain, and transcriptional repression domain
of MLL fused to the CREB-binding domain or to the bromodomain of CREBBP.
Both fusion products retained the histone acetyltransferase domain of
CREBBP and may lead to leukemia by promoting histone acetylation of
genomic regions targeted by the MLL AT-hooks, leading to transcriptional
deregulation via aberrant chromatin organization.

Panagopoulos et al. (2001) reported a novel t(10;16)(q22;p13)
chromosomal translocation in a childhood acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML-M5a) leading to a MORF (605880)-CBP chimera. RT-PCR experiments
yielded in-frame MORF-CBP and CBP-MORF fusion transcripts. Genomic
analyses revealed that the breaks were close to Alu elements in intron
16 of MORF and intron 2 of CBP and that duplications had occurred near
the breakpoints. The MORF-CBP protein retained the zinc fingers, 2
nuclear localization signals, the histone acetyltransferase (HAT)
domain, a portion of the acidic domain of MORF, and the CBP protein
downstream of codon 29. The part of CBP encoding the RARA-binding
domain, the CREB-binding domain, the 3 cys/his-rich regions, the
bromodomain, the HAT domain, and the glu-rich domains was present. In
the reciprocal CBP-MORF, part of the acidic domain and the C-terminal
ser- and met-rich regions of MORF may be driven by the CBP promoter.

The t(8;16)(p11;p13) translocation, which is strongly associated with
AML displaying monocytic differentiation, erythrophagocytosis by the
leukemic cells, and a poor response to chemotherapy, fuses the CBP gene
on chromosome 16p13 with the MOZ gene on chromosome 8p11. Panagopoulos
et al. (2003) sequenced the breakpoints in 4 t(8;16)-positive AML cases.
The breaks clustered in both CBP intron 2 and MOZ intron 16, and were
close to repetitive elements; in 1 case, an Alu-Alu junction for the
CBP/MOZ hybrid was identified. All 4 cases showed additional genomic
events (i.e., deletions, duplications, and insertions) in the breakpoint
regions in both the MOZ and CBP genes. Thus, the translocation did not
originate through a simple end-to-end fusion. The findings of multiple
breaks and rearrangements suggested the involvement of a damage repair
mechanism in the origin of this translocation.

- Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome 1

Petrij et al. (1995) found that all the breakpoints and microdeletions
in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome are located in 16p13.3, in a region
containing the CREBBP gene. They showed, furthermore, that RSTS results
not only from gross chromosomal rearrangements of 16p but also from
heterozygous point mutations in the CBP gene itself (see, e.g.,
600140.0001), suggesting that the loss of one functional copy of the CBP
gene underlies the developmental abnormalities in RSTS, and possibly the
propensity for malignancy and keloid formation. To search for mutations
in RSTS patients without rearrangements, Petrij et al. (1995) used the
protein truncation test. In 2 of 16 patients, a truncated protein
product was found; both patients, who had classic RSTS phenotype, had a
change of a glutamine codon to a stop codon (see 600140.0001 and
600140.0002).

Taine et al. (1998) found microdeletion of the RT1 probe (D16S237) in 3
of 30 French patients with RSTS. By pooling data from their study and
previous series, they found the cumulative frequency of the 16p13.3
microdeletion to be 11.9% (19 in 159). Most reported microdeletions of
the CREBBP gene in RSTS had been detected by FISH with a single cosmid
probe specific to the 3-prime region of the gene. To explore the
possibility that the rate of microdeletion-positive cases would be
greater if the entire gene were evaluated, Blough et al. (2000)
performed FISH on 66 patients with an established diagnosis of RSTS,
using a panel of 5 cosmids spanning the CREBBP gene. Five of the 66
patients had deletions by FISH (9%), consistent with those rates
reported in various series that ranged between 3% and 25%. The findings
of a partial 5-prime deletion and of interstitial deletions of the gene
added to the known spectrum of mutations and demonstrated the need for
evaluation of the entire CREBBP gene in RSTS patients. No phenotypic
differences between partial deletion, complete deletion, and nondeletion
patients were observed, supporting a haploinsufficiency model for this
disorder.

Petrij et al. (2000) reported diagnostic analysis of 194 patients with
RSTS. Of these, 86 had previously been reported. A total of 157
individuals were tested by FISH, 23 by protein truncation test, and 14
by both methods for microdeletions and truncating mutations in CBP.
Fourteen of 171 (8.2%) patients had microdeletions. Eighty-nine of the
171 were tested using 5 cosmid probes: RT1, RT100, RT102, RT191, RT203
and RT166. Eight microdeletions were found in this group, of which 4
were not deleted for RT1/RT100. Petrij et al. (2000) concluded that the
use of all 5 probes is essential to detect all microdeletions in
patients with clinical features of RSTS. The protein truncation test
revealed truncating mutations in 4 of 37 (10.8%) cases. Petrij et al.
(2000) concluded that microdeletions and truncating mutations in CBP
account for approximately 20% of mutations in individuals with the RSTS
phenotype.

Petrij et al. (2000) stated that the breakpoints of 6 translocations and
inversions described in RSTS patients clustered in a 13-kb intronic
region at the 5-prime end of the CBP gene and could theoretically result
only in proteins containing the extreme N-terminal region of
CREB-binding protein. Microdeletions had occurred more frequently, in
approximately 10% of cases. In contrast to the previous findings, Petrij
et al. (2000) showed that in one patient with a translocation
t(2;16)(q36.3;p13.3), the chromosome 16 breakpoint was located about 100
kb downstream of the previously identified breakpoint cluster. Fiber
FISH and Southern blot analysis were used in this determination. Western
blot analysis of extracts prepared from lymphoblasts showed both a
normal and an abnormal shorter protein lacking the C-terminal domain,
indicating expression of both the normal and the mutant allele. The
results suggested that the loss of C-terminal domains of the protein
product is sufficient to cause RSTS. Furthermore, the data indicated the
potential utility of Western blot analysis as an inexpensive and fast
approach for screening RSTS mutations.

Murata et al. (2001) analyzed the CBP gene in 16 RSTS patients. A
microdeletion was identified in 1 patient by FISH analysis;
heteroallelic mutations were identified in 5 patients. These included a
2-bp and an 11-bp deletion, a 14-bp insertion, and a missense mutation
resulting in an arg1378-to-pro substitution (600140.0003). This missense
mutation was introduced into the recombinant mouse CBP, where it
abolished the HAT activity of CBP and the ability of CBP to
transactivate CREB. The authors hypothesized that loss of HAT activity
of CBP may cause RSTS. They further speculated that treatment of RSTS
patients with histone deacetylase inhibitors might have beneficial
effects.

Among 63 patients with RSTS, Coupry et al. (2002) used several molecular
techniques, including cDNA probes to search for gross gene
rearrangements, intragenic microsatellite markers, and PCR with direct
sequencing, to identify 22 novel point mutations in the CBP gene. In 33
patients, no abnormality in the CBP gene was detected.

Kalkhoven et al. (2003) performed mutational analysis in 39 RSTS
patients and identified 8 heterozygous mutations in the HAT domain of
CBP, one of which altered a conserved plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc
finger amino acid (E1278K; 600140.0006), while a second deleted exon 22
(600140.0007), which encodes the central region of the PHD finger.
Functional analysis revealed that these PHD finger mutants lacked in
vitro acetyltransferase activity towards histones and CBP itself and
displayed reduced coactivator function for the transcription factor
CREB. In EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells from the exon 22 deletion
patient, there was 50% less endogenous CBP HAT activity. The authors
stressed the functional importance of the PHD finger in vivo, and
implied that reduction of CBP HAT activity, as exemplified by disruption
of the PHD finger, may be sufficient to cause RSTS.

In 6 (28.6%) of 21 RSTS patients in whom no point mutations had been
identified, Stef et al. (2007) used comparative genomic hybridization on
microarrays and quantitative multiplex fluorescent-PCR to identify
deletions involving the CREBBP gene. The deletions ranged in size from
3.3 kb to 6.5 Mb; 1 patient had a deleterious duplication containing
exon 16. No phenotypic differences were observed, except for 1 patient
with a 6.5-Mb deletion, who had a severe phenotype and died at 34 days
of life. Stef et al. (2007) concluded that CREBBP dosage anomalies
constitute a common cause of the disorder and recommended
high-resolution gene dosage studies of the CREBBP gene in candidate
patients.

Gervasini et al. (2007) used FISH and microsatellite analysis to screen
42 Italian RSTS patients and identified deletions involving the CREBBP
gene that ranged in size from 150 kb to 2.6 Mb in 6 patients. Three of
the patients were low-level mosaics, with the deletion present in less
than 30% of lymphoctyes and in less than 20% of epithelial cells
analyzed. The authors noted that, despite the small number of deleted
cells in the investigated tissues, the clinical phenotype of the mosaic
patients was quite typical, thus emphasizing the dose sensitivity of
CREBBP.

- Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy

Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA; 313200) is an inherited
neurodegenerative disease caused by CAG repeat expansion within the gene
encoding the androgen receptor (AR; 313700). The expansion results in an
expanded polyglutamine tract, which likely confers a novel, toxic
function to the affected protein. Cell culture and transgenic mouse
studies have implicated the nucleus as a site for pathogenesis,
suggesting that a critical nuclear factor or process may be disrupted by
the polyglutamine expansion. McCampbell et al. (2000) demonstrated that
CREB-binding protein is incorporated into nuclear inclusions formed by
polyglutamine-containing proteins in cultured cells, transgenic mice,
and tissue from patients with SBMA. Soluble levels of CREB-binding
protein were reduced in cells expressing expanded polyglutamine despite
increased levels of CBP mRNA. Overexpression of CREBBP rescued cells
from polyglutamine-mediated toxicity in neuronal cell culture. The
authors proposed a CREBBP-sequestration model of polyglutamine expansion
disease.

- Chromosome 16p13.3 Duplication Syndrome

Thienpont et al. (2010) reported 12 unrelated patients with mild to
moderate mental retardation and mild skeletal anomalies associated with
interstitial duplication of chromosome 16p13.3 (613458). Ten of the 12
duplications occurred de novo, and 2 were inherited from unaffected
parents. The duplications ranged in size, but the smallest region of
overlap was 186 to 260 kb in size and included the CREBBP gene. None of
the breakpoints were recurrent, arguing against nonallelic homologous
recombination as a mechanism. The findings indicated that CREBBP is
dosage-sensitive. Thienpont et al. (2010) estimated the frequency of
CREBBP duplication to be 1 in 97,000 to 146,000 live births.

- Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma

Pasqualucci et al. (2011) reported that the 2 most common types of B
cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (605027), follicular lymphoma and diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma, harbor frequent structural alterations
inactivating CREBBP and, more rarely, EP300 (602700), 2 highly related
histone and nonhistone acetyltransferases (HATs) that act as
transcriptional coactivators in multiple signaling pathways. Overall,
about 39% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 41% of follicular
lymphoma cases display genomic deletions and/or somatic mutations that
remove or inactivate the HAT coding domain of these 2 genes. These
lesions usually affect 1 allele, suggesting that reduction in HAT dosage
is important for lymphomagenesis. Pasqualucci et al. (2011) demonstrated
specific defects in acetylation-mediated inactivation of the BCL6
oncoprotein (109565) and activation of the p53 tumor suppressor
(191170).

- Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

Mullighan et al. (2011) found that 18.3% of relapse cases of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia had sequence or deletion mutations in CREBBP and
that these frequently occurred in the histone acetyltransferase domain.

EVOLUTION

While mapping and cloning the human CREBBP gene on 16p13.3, Giles et al.
(1997) noticed an emerging pattern of relationship between this
chromosome band and a region of chromosome 22q. CBP exhibits extensive
homology to the adenovirus E1A-associated protein p300, whose gene
(EP300; 602700) maps to 22q13 (Eckner et al., 1994; Lundblad et al.,
1995). They noted that the heme oxygenase-1 gene (HMOX1; 141250) maps to
22q12 and the heme oxygenase-2 gene (HMOX2; 141251) to 16p13.3
Furthermore, the gene for phosphomannomutase-2 (PMM2; 601785) is on
16p13 and that for phosphomannomutase-1 (PMM1; 601786) is on 22q13.
Sequence comparison at the amino acid level revealed that homology
between these paralogous proteins is high: 63% between CBP and p300, 66%
between PMM1 and PMM2, and 74% between HMOX1 and HMOX2. By examination
of genome databases, e.g., OMIM, Giles et al. (1998) found 6 additional
sets of paralogs mapping to 16p13 and 22q11-q13, although the extent of
homology between these paralogous sets was not known. These pairs were
SSTR5 (182455) and SSTR3 (182453) on 16 and 22, respectively; CSNK2A2
(115442) and CSNK1E (600863); UBE2I (601661) and UB2L3; MYH11 (160745)
and MYH9 (160775); CRYM (123740) and a cluster of crystallin genes on
chromosome 22, e.g., CRYBB1 (600929); IL4RA (147781) and IL2RB (146710).
Giles et al. (1998) postulated that these bands show homology because of
an ancestral event of the type proposed by Ohno (1993). Arguing from the
fact that chromosome 14q carries SSTR1 (182451), UBE2L1 (600012), MYH6
(160710), and MYH7 (160760), whereas SSTR2 (182452), CSNK1D (600864),
and CRYBA1 (123610) map to 17q, combined with the location on leukemia
breakpoints, strongly suggested to Giles et al. (1998) that these gene
families arose by tetraploidization resulting in members on 14q, 16p,
17q, and 22q. Genetic redundancy is potentially of great relevance to
organismal evolution since it may protect against potentially harmful
mutations and may provide a pool of diverse yet functionally similar
proteins for further evolution.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tanaka et al. (1997) generated Cbp +/- mice with haploinsufficiency of
the Cbp protein, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis. Many of the
mutant mice exhibited abnormal skeletal patterning similar to some
features found in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, including delayed
ossification of the frontal bones, enlarged anterior fontanels, and
various anomalies of the sternum, rib cage, xiphoid process, and
vertebrae. The mutant mice also had decreased levels of bone
morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7; 112267), a molecule believed to be part
of the signaling cascade in skeletal development. Tanaka et al. (1997)
found that mice homozygous for the mutation died in utero.

Kung et al. (2000) showed that Cbp +/- mice display an increased cancer
risk similar to that seen in patients with RSTS. These results provided
experimental evidence that CBP has tumor suppressing activity.

To identify the physiologic functions of the Cbp protein using a
loss-of-function mutant, Yamauchi et al. (2002) analyzed Cbp-deficient
mice. As Crebbp-null mice died during embryogenesis, they used
heterozygous mice. Unexpectedly, Crebbp +/- mice showed markedly reduced
weight of white adipose tissue but not of other tissues. Despite this
lipodystrophy, Crebbp +/- mice showed increased insulin sensitivity and
glucose tolerance and were completely protected from body weight gain
induced by high-fat diet. They observed increased leptin sensitivity and
increased serum adiponectin (605441) levels in Crebbp +/- mice. These
increased effects of insulin-sensitizing hormones secreted from white
adipose tissue may explain, at least in part, the phenotypes of Crebbp
+/- mice. The study demonstrated that CBP may function as a
'master-switch' between energy storage and expenditure.

Kasper et al. (2002) demonstrated that the protein-binding KIX domains
of CBP and p300 (602700) have nonredundant functions in mice. In mice
homozygous for point mutations in the KIX domain of p300 designed to
disrupt the binding surface for the transcription factors c-Myb (189990)
and Creb, multilineage defects occur in hematopoiesis, including anemia,
B-cell deficiency, thymic hypoplasia, megakaryocytosis, and
thrombocytosis. By contrast, age-matched mice homozygous for identical
mutations in the KIX domain of CBP are essentially normal. There is a
synergistic genetic interaction between mutations in c-MYB and mutations
in the KIX domain of p300, which suggests that the binding of c-MYB to
this domain of p300 is crucial for the development and function of
megakaryocytes. Thus, Kasper et al. (2002) concluded that conserved
domains in 2 highly related coactivators have contrasting roles in
hematopoiesis.

Bourtchouladze et al. (2003) reasoned that drugs that modulate CREB
function by enhancing cAMP signaling might yield an effective treatment
for the memory defect of CBP +/- mice. To this end, they designed a
cell-based drug screen and discovered inhibitors of phosphodiesterase-4
(see 600126, for example) to be particularly effective enhancers of CREB
function. They extended previous behavioral observations by showing that
CBP +/- mutants have impaired long-term memory but normal learning and
short-term memory in an objective recognition task. They demonstrated
that the prototypic PDE4 inhibitor, rolipram, and a novel one (HT0712)
abolish the long-term memory defect of CBP +/- mice. The genetic lesion
in CBP acts specifically to shift the dose sensitivity for HT0712 to
enhance memory formation, which conveys molecular specificity on the
drug's mechanism of action. The results suggested that PDE4 inhibitors
might be used to treat the cognitive dysfunction of RSTS patients.

Alarcon et al. (2004) found that transgenic mice haploinsufficient for
the Cbp protein exhibited normal activity, motivation, anxiety, and
working short-term memory, but had reduced long-term memory for fear and
object recognition. Electrophysiologic measurements showed that the
mutant mice had normal basal synaptic transmission, but had a defect in
the late phase of hippocampal long-term potentiation that is dependent
on transcriptional activation. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot
analysis showed that the Cbp +/- mice had decreased acetylation of
histone H2B (see 609904), indicating an alteration in chromatin. Both
enhancement of the expression of CREB-dependent genes and inhibition of
histone deacetylation ameliorated the long-term potentiation and memory
defects. Alarcon et al. (2004) concluded that some of the cognitive
deficits in RTS may result from the continued requirement throughout
life for both functions of CBP: activation of CREB and histone
acetylation with chromatin remodeling.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RUBINSTEIN-TAYBI SYNDROME 1
CREBBP, GLN136TER

In a patient with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome-1 (RSTS1; 180849), Petrij et
al. (1995) identified a C-T transition in the CREBBP gene, resulting in
a stop codon and a truncated protein product.

.0002
RUBINSTEIN-TAYBI SYNDROME 1
CREBBP, GLN357TER

In a patient with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome-1 (RSTS1; 180849), Petrij et
al. (1995) identified a C-T transition in the CREBBP gene, resulting in
a stop codon and a truncated protein product. In this patient, the
mutation destroyed a PvuII restriction site. Since the site was found to
be intact in both chromosomes of the parents, the mutation in the
patient must have been de novo.

.0003
RUBINSTEIN-TAYBI SYNDROME 1
CREBBP, ARG1378PRO

In a patient with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome-1 (180849), Murata et al.
(2001) demonstrated a G-C transversion in the CREBBP gene, resulting in
an arg1378-to-pro (R1378P) substitution. In a transgenic mouse model,
this mutation abolished HAT activity of the CREB-binding protein.

.0004
RUBINSTEIN-TAYBI SYNDROME 1
CREBBP, 2-BP DEL, NT5222

In a patient with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome-1 (180849), Murata et al.
(2001) demonstrated a 2-bp deletion in the CREBBP gene of nucleotides
5222-5223, leading to missense translation from codons 1469-1476,
followed by premature termination at codon 1477.

.0005
RUBINSTEIN-TAYBI SYNDROME 1, INCOMPLETE
CREBBP, TYR1175CYS

In a patient with a mild form of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome-1 (180849),
Bartsch et al. (2002) identified a 3524A-G transition in the CREBBP
gene, resulting in a tyr1175-to-cys (Y1175C) substitution. The authors
concluded that the missense mutation resulted in the milder phenotype.

.0006
RUBINSTEIN-TAYBI SYNDROME 1
CREBBP, GLU1278LYS

In a patient with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome-1 (180849), Kalkhoven et al.
(2003) identified a 3832G-A transition in the CREBBP gene, resulting in
a glu1278-to-lys (E1278K) substitution at a conserved residue within the
PHD finger of the HAT domain.

.0007
RUBINSTEIN-TAYBI SYNDROME 1
CREBBP, IVS21, A-T, -2

In a patient with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome-1 (180849), Kalkhoven et al.
(2003) identified an A-to-T transversion 2 bp 5-prime to exon 22 in the
CREBBP gene. The mutation was predicted to result in aberrant splicing
and loss of the 26 amino acids encoded by exon 22. These residues lie in
the middle of the PHD finger of the HAT domain. Expression studies
revealed loss of HAT activity in transiently transfected cells.

.0008
RUBINSTEIN-TAYBI SYNDROME 1, INCOMPLETE
CREBBP, THR910ALA

In a girl, her mother, and maternal grandmother with an incomplete form
of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome-1 (180849), Bartsch et al. (2010)
identified a heterozygous 2728A-G transition in exon 14 of the CREBBP
gene, resulting in a thr910-to-ala (T910A) substitution in a partially
conserved residue. The mutation occurred outside the crucial histone
acetyltransferase domain, which could explain the milder phenotype. The
12-year-old female proband had mild dysmorphic features, such as
high-arched eyebrows, elongated face, prominent nose, high-arched
palate, short broad thumbs, and broad halluces. She had a short
attention span, dyslexia, dyscalculia, reading difficulties, and needed
specal teaching in language and mathematics. Her mother had similar
facial features, was mildly obese, and had normal intelligence. The
grandmother reportedly had a similar appearance and had not finished
school. The report confirmed autosomal dominant inheritance of the
disorder.

606907	TITLE *606907 APOLIPOPROTEIN M; APOM
;;NG20, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Xu and Dahlback (1999) identified APOM through N-terminal sequencing of
proteins associated with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRLP). By
searching 2 liver cDNA libraries with probes designed from an EST
containing the sequence, they cloned human APOM. The deduced 188-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 21 kD. It contains
a potential N-glycosylation site, 2 possible disulfide bridges, and a
hydrophobic alpha-helical signal peptide that is retained in the mature
protein. Sequence analysis revealed 79% identity between the human and
mouse proteins. Northern blot analysis by Xu and Dahlback (1999)
detected restricted expression of a 750-bp transcript in liver and
kidney. Northern blot analysis of several cell lines by Albertella et
al. (1996) detected a 1.1-kb transcript in HepG2 liver cells but not in
human fibroblast, leukocyte, or monocytic cell lines. By Western blot
analysis, Xu and Dahlback (1999) found that APOM is a minor component of
high and low density lipoproteins as well as TGRLP. In vitro translation
in the presence of microsomes resulted in a protein of 26 kD, suggesting
that APOM is translocated through the membrane and glycosylated.

GENE STRUCTURE

By Southern blot analysis, Albertella et al. (1996) determined that APOM
is present in single copy in the genome.

MAPPING

By homology with the corresponding mouse gene, Ng20, which maps to
chromosome 17, and by sequence analysis, Xu and Dahlback (1999) mapped
the human APOM gene to chromosome 6p21.3, between the BAT3 (142590) and
BAT4 (142610) genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wolfrum et al. (2005) demonstrated that mice deficient in Apom
accumulated cholesterol in large HDL particles while the conversion of
HDL to pre-beta-HDL was impaired, leading to a markedly reduced
cholesterol efflux from macrophages to Apom-deficient HDL compared to
normal HDL in vitro. Overexpression of Apom in low density lipoprotein
receptor (LDLR; 606945)-null mice protected against atherosclerosis when
the mice were challenged with a cholesterol-enriched diet. Wolfrum et
al. (2005) concluded that APOM is important for the formation of
pre-beta-HDL and cholesterol efflux to HDL, and thereby inhibits
formation of atherosclerotic lesions.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterases (EC 3.1.2.2), such as ACOT7, are found
in all organisms and cleave fatty acyl-CoAs into free fatty acids and
CoA.

CLONING

Engberg et al. (1997) purified a liver cytosolic isoform of long-chain
acyl-CoA thioesterase from peroxisome proliferator-treated rats and
named it CTE-II for 'cytosolic long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterase.'
Antibodies against CTE-II were used to screen an expression library of
peroxisome proliferator-induced rat liver cDNA. The predicted 338-amino
acid protein migrated at 40 kD on SDS-PAGE. Engberg et al. (1997)
observed many evenly distributed nucleotide differences and pronounced
differences in the C-terminal regions between CTE-II and the closely
related ACT (602586) and suggested that the 2 enzymes are encoded by
different genes. Engberg et al. (1997) noted that there are human ESTs
homologous to CTE-II.

Yamada et al. (1997) isolated cDNAs encoding long-chain acyl-CoA
hydrolases from rat brain and liver cDNA libraries and designated the
clones Bach and Lach, respectively. Since the nucleotide sequences of
the N-terminal regions were entirely different but the downstream
sequences were virtually identical, Yamada et al. (1997) suggested that
Bach and Lach are derived from the same gene by alternative splicing.

Using a rat Bach cDNA to screen a human brain cDNA library, Yamada et
al. (1999) cloned BACH. The deduced protein contains 338 amino acids and
shares 95% identity with rat Bach. Northern blot analysis detected a
1.9-kb BACH transcript in human brain RNA. Biochemical analysis of human
brain homogenates showed that BACH is a cytosolic enzyme. SDS-PAGE
detected BACH at 43 kD, but gel filtration detected BACH at about 100
kD, indicating that the protein forms multimers.

By 5-prime RACE and RT-PCR of human brain total RNA, Yamada et al.
(2002) identified 6 BACH splice variants. Four variants, designated
BACHa to BACHd, differ in their use of 1 of 4 alternate first exons
(exons 1a through 1d, respectively) and encode proteins of 329 to 380
amino acids. All 4 of these proteins contain the hydrolase domain and a
bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) in their C-terminal halves,
and BACHb and BACHc have N-terminal mitochondrial localization signals.
The 2 remaining variants contain exon X, an alternatively spliced exon
between exons 7 and 8 that causes a frameshift and introduces a
premature stop codon. These C-terminally truncated proteins of 246 and
283 amino acids lack the hydrolase domain and NLS. The BACH proteins
containing the mitochondrial localization signal were detected in
mitochondria of transfected mouse neuroblastoma cells, but those
containing only the NLS did not localize to nuclei, even though the
isolated NLS was functional when fused to a test protein.
Immunohistochemical analysis of human brain detected BACHa in the
cytosol of neurons such as pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex and
Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. In mouse brain, Bacha was also
detected in nuclei as well as cytosol of certain large neurons in the
cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. Yamada et al. (2002)
suggested that the NLS of BACH may be masked by the full-length protein
as a regulatory mechanism.

GENE FUNCTION

Yamada et al. (1997) found that bacterial extracts of E. coli expressing
either rat Bach or Lach cDNAs had 100-fold higher acyl-CoA hydrolase
activity, demonstrating that both cDNAs encode long-chain acyl-CoA
hydrolases.

By analyzing the activity of purified BACH against several fatty
acyl-CoAs, Yamada et al. (1999) found that BACH showed a relatively
broad specificity, with acyl-CoAs with carbon chains of C8 to C18 being
good substrates. BACH activity was inhibited by a sulfhydryl blocking
agent. Recombinant BACH was also active against palmitoyl-CoA.

Yang et al. (2004) found significantly decreased levels of acyl-CoA
hydrolase in hippocampal tissue from 5 patients with mesial temporal
lobe epilepsy (608096) compared to controls.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yamada et al. (2002) determined that the ACOT7 gene contains 13 exons,
including 4 alternative first exons (exons 1a through 1d) and exon X, an
alternatively spliced exon between exons 7 and 8. The gene spans 129 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Yamada et al. (1999) mapped the ACOT7 gene
to chromosome 1p36.2. Hunt et al. (2005) stated that the human ACOT7
gene maps to chromosome 1p36.31-p36.11 and the mouse Acot7 gene maps to
chromosome 4E2.

NOMENCLATURE

Hunt et al. (2005) noted that acyl-CoA thioesterases are referred to in
the literature as acyl-CoA hydrolases, but the reaction catalyzed is the
cleavage of a thioester bond. They presented a revised nomenclature for
these enzymes using the name acyl-CoA thioesterase and the root gene
symbol ACOT.

151442	TITLE *151442 STATHMIN 1; STMN1
;;STATHMIN; SMN;;
LEUKEMIA-ASSOCIATED PHOSPHOPROTEIN p18; LAP18;;
METABLASTIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the stathmin family sequester tubulin (see 191130) in a
ternary complex, with 2 tubulins for every stathmin-like protein.
Formation of the complex interferes with microtubule dynamics in vitro
and in vivo.

CLONING

Hanash et al. (1988) demonstrated an increased level of an 18-kD
cytosolic phosphoprotein (p18) in the cells of various types of human
acute leukemia. The cDNA that encodes p18 was cloned by Zhu et al.
(1989).

Sobel et al. (1989) suggested that this protein be called stathmin, from
the Greek 'stathmos' (relay).

By immunofluorescence microscopy, Gavet et al. (1998) detected
endogenous HeLa cell stathmin expressed in a punctate cytoplasmic
distribution, with staining concentrated around the nucleus.

By real-time quantitative RT-PCR, Bieche et al. (2003) detected stathmin
expression in all tissues examined. Expression was strongest in fetal
and adult brain, spinal cord, and cerebellum, followed by thymus, bone
marrow, testis, and fetal liver. Expression was intermediate in colon,
ovary, placenta, uterus, and trachea, and was readily detected at
substantially lower levels in all other tissues examined. Lowest
expression was found in adult liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Sobel (1991) stated that stathmin is a ubiquitous, phylogenetically
conserved protein present in the cytoplasm in a variety of
unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms. Its expression and
phosphorylation are regulated throughout development in response to
extracellular signals regulating cell proliferation, differentiation,
and function. The overall pattern of its molecular forms reflects the
activation of corresponding second messenger pathways. This
phosphoprotein is therefore a good candidate for a general relay in
signal transduction, possibly integrating diverse signals from the
cell's environment.

Kumar and Haugen (1994) observed that stathmin exists in bone cells and
proposed that the protein may play a role in altering osteoblast growth
and response to various hormonal stimuli.

Maucuer et al. (1995) identified 4 mouse proteins that could interact
with human stathmin in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of an embryonic mouse
expression library. These included a member of the heat-shock protein
family (Bip; 138120), retinoblastoma-inducible coiled-coil protein
(Rb1cc1; 606837), a putative serine/threonine kinase, and a second
protein with a coiled-coil structure.

Using antibody directed against stathmin phosphorylated on ser16, Gavet
et al. (1998) found that interphase HeLa cells were weakly stained, but
mitotic cells were strongly labeled. Staining of mitotic cells increased
from prophase to metaphase and decreased at cytokinesis. Analysis of
synchronized cell extracts showed that phosphorylation of ser16 was
detected in G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Overexpression of several
phosphorylation site mutants suggested that stathmin induces
depolymerization of interphase and mitotic microtubules in its
unphosphorylated state, but is inactivated by phosphorylation in
mitosis.

Wen et al. (2010) described a potential link between stathmin and
microtubule defects in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA; 253300), a motor
neuron degeneration disorder caused by defects in the survival of motor
neuron-1 gene (SMN1; 600354) that result in insufficient SMN protein.
Stathmin was identified by proteomics analysis of Smn-knockdown NSC34
cells. Stathmin was aberrantly upregulated in vitro and in vivo, leading
to a decreased level of polymerized tubulin, which was correlated with
disease severity. Reduced microtubule densities and beta-3-tubulin
(TUBB3; 602661) levels in distal axons of affected SMA-like mice and an
impaired microtubule network in Smn-deficient cells were observed,
suggesting an involvement of stathmin in those microtubule defects.
Furthermore, knockdown of stathmin restored the microtubule network
defects of Smn-deficient cells, promoted axon outgrowth, and reduced the
defect in mitochondria transport in SMA-like motor neurons. The authors
concluded that aberrant stathmin levels may play a detrimental role in
SMA.

By screening human brain tumor transcript library supernatants with
human astrocytes to identify proteins interacting with TLR3 (603029),
Bsibsi et al. (2010) identified STMN1. Wildtype mouse astrocytes, but
not astrocytes from Tlr3-deficient mice, responded to Stmn1. STMN1 and
poly(I:C) induced the same set of transcripts in human astrocytes. STMN1
also activated intracellular TLR3 in human microglia. The STMN1 TLR3
agonist activity was dependent on an intact alpha-helical structure of
STMN1. TLR3-transfected human embryonic kidney cells failed to respond
to STMN1, suggesting a requirement for additional surface factors
present on astrocytes and microglia. Confocal microscopy of multiple
sclerosis (see 126200) lesions demonstrated colocalization of STMN1 and
TLR3 in inflamed areas, primarily in astrocytes and microglia, but only
occasionally in oligodendrocytes.

MAPPING

Ferrari et al. (1990) mapped the LAP18 gene to 1p36.1-p35 by Southern
analysis of human-rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs and by chromosome in
situ hybridization using a p18 genomic probe. They pointed out that this
region of chromosome 1 is frequently involved in visible deletions or
loss of heterozygosity in tumors derived from neural crest cells,
particularly neuroblastomas and melanomas. The high levels of expression
of p18 in brain and neuroendocrine tumor cells, its possible role in
growth regulation, and its chromosomal location suggest that this gene
may be involved in genetic events underlying some of these tumors.

Mock et al. (1993) mapped the homologous gene to distal mouse chromosome
4 by haplotype analysis of progeny from an interspecific backcross.
Okazaki et al. (1993) showed that the stathmin gene in mouse is about 6
kb long and is located on chromosome 4 with possible pseudogenes on
chromosomes 9 and 17. The related gene SCG10 (600621) was mapped to
mouse chromosome 3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Shumyatsky et al. (2005) found that stathmin was highly expressed in the
lateral nucleus of the amygdala, as well as in the thalamic and cortical
structures that send information to the amygdala about conditioned and
unconditioned stimuli. Stathmin-knockout mice exhibited decreased memory
in amygdala-dependent fear conditioning and failed to recognize danger
in innately aversive environments. In contrast, these mice did not show
deficits in the water maze, a spatial task dependent on the hippocampus,
where stathmin is not normally expressed. The amygdala of knockout mice
showed increased amounts of microtubules, although neuronal morphology
and synaptic transmission was normal. However, whole-cell recordings
from amygdala slices isolated from stathmin-knockout mice showed
deficits in spike-timing-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP). The
findings suggested that stathmin is required for the induction of LTP in
afferent inputs to the amygdala and is essential in regulating both
innate and learned fear. Shumyatsky et al. (2005) postulated that a
decrease in microtubule dynamics could result in deficits in synaptic
plasticity.

Martel et al. (2008) observed that stathmin-null female mice showed
improper threat assessment, which affected innate parental care. They
showed a profound deficiency in maternal behavior, including lack of
motivation for retrieving pups and inability to choose a safe location
for nest building. In addition, stathmin-null adult females showed
increased social interactions as hosts in the host-intruder paradigm.
RNA studies detected stathmin expression in the basolateral amygdala
(BLA). Bilateral lesions in the BLA of wildtype females resulted in
similar deficits in pup retrieval. The findings implicated stathmin as a
critical molecular component linking neural circuitry of the BLA nuclei
with innate behavior resulting from threat assessment.

608012	TITLE *608012 PROTEIN DISULFIDE ISOMERASE, FAMILY A, MEMBER 2; PDIA2
;;PROTEIN DISULFIDE ISOMERASE, PANCREATIC; PDIP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Protein disulfide isomerases (EC 5.3.4.1), such as PDIP, are endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) resident proteins that catalyze protein folding and
thiol-disulfide interchange reactions (Desilva et al., 1996).

CLONING

Desilva et al. (1996) cloned PDIP from an insulinoma subtraction cDNA
library. The deduced 511-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 56.6 kD and contains 2 thioredoxin (187700)-like catalytic
sites, a C-terminal ER retention sequence (KEEL), and 3 potential
N-glycosylation sites. PDIP shares about 46% identity with bovine,
mouse, rabbit, and human PDIs (176790). Northern blot analysis detected
a 2.0-kb transcript expressed exclusively in pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Desilva et al. (1996) determined that recombinant PDIP, expressed in E.
coli, catalyzed the reductive cleavage of radiolabeled insulin and
reactivated reduced RNase A.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, Desilva et al. (1996) mapped
the PDIP gene to chromosome 16p13.3.

;;CD3 ANTIGEN, ZETA SUBUNIT; CD3Z;;
CD3-ZETA;;
T-CELL ANTIGEN RECEPTOR COMPLEX, ZETA SUBUNIT OF CD3; TCRZ
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Weissman et al. (1986) used an antiserum raised against the mouse zeta
subunit of the T-cell antigen receptor to identify a previously
unrecognized component of the human T-cell antigen receptor. This human
protein is T-cell specific and biochemically similar to the murine zeta
polypeptide, which has a molecular weight of 16K. The zeta chain, which,
like the epsilon chain, is nonglycosylated, exists in the T-cell
receptor molecule as a disulfide-linked homodimer.

Weissman et al. (1988) cloned a cDNA encoding the zeta chain of the
murine T-cell antigen receptor. The predicted protein sequence suggested
a structure distinct from those of any of the previously described
receptor subunits.

As indicated by Clevers et al. (1988), the T-cell receptor alpha/beta
and gamma/delta heterodimers are noncovalently associated with the
CD3-gamma (186740), -delta (186790), -epsilon (186830), and -zeta
proteins, together forming the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex. Weissman et
al. (1988) used the cDNA for the murine zeta gene as a probe to isolate
cDNAs encoding the human CD3Z gene. Comparison of the human and murine
genes showed a high degree of conservation, including conservation in
the nucleotide sequence of the 5-prime and 3-prime untranslated regions.
No significant sequence and structural homology was found, however, with
the previously characterized invariant delta, gamma, and epsilon chains
of the T-cell receptor.

GENE FUNCTION

The zeta chain of the T-cell antigen receptor plays an important role in
coupling antigen recognition to several intracellular
signal-transduction pathways. Caplan et al. (1995) presented evidence
that the zeta chain, while expressed on the T-cell surface, is
associated with the cytoskeletal matrix. A 42-amino acid region in the
intracytoplasmic domain of the zeta chain proved crucial for maximal
interaction between zeta chain and the cytoskeleton.

CD4 (186940) binds to relatively invariant sites on class II major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules outside the peptide-binding
groove, which interacts with the T-cell receptor (TCR). CD4 enhances
T-cell sensitivity to antigen and binds to LCK (153390), which
phosphorylates CD3Z. Instead of clustering in a cap at the interface
with an antigen-presenting cell (APC), some signaling molecules involved
in T-cell recognition segregate into distinct areas to form a SMAC
(supramolecular activation cluster), contributing to the immunologic
synapse (see Grakoui et al. (1999)). Using T-cell lines transfected with
green fluorescent protein-fused CD4 or CD3Z and 3-dimensional video
microscopy, Krummel et al. (2000) showed that in response to
peptide-loaded APC, CD3Z and CD4 initially cluster in the contact area
between the T cell and APC coincident with intracellular calcium
mobilization. Stable immunologic synapse formation was modulated by
peptide concentration and compromised by blocking the calcium increase
or cytoskeletal rearrangement. The authors determined that CD3Z remains
at the center of the interface while CD4 moves to the periphery.
Blocking with anti-TCR prevented CD3Z accumulation and inhibited calcium
mobilization. The data suggested that instead of stabilizing TCR-MHC
complexes, CD4 functions to initiate or augment the early phase of
T-cell activation.

MAPPING

The CD3Z gene was localized by Weissman et al. (1988) to the centromeric
region of chromosome 1 by study of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ
hybridization, emphasizing the fact that it is a distinct genetic
component of the T-cell receptor (the CD3D, CD3G, and CD3E genes are
clustered within 300 kb of each other on 11q23). The gene was assigned
to 1p22.1-q21.1. Baniyash et al. (1989) mapped the homologous gene in
the mouse to chromosome 1. Sturm et al. (1995) mapped the human OTF1
gene (164175) to 1q22-q23 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The
physical linkage of the CD3Z gene to the OTF1 transcription unit
indicates that CD3Z is also located at 1q22-q23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Rieux-Laucat et al. (2006) described a 4-month-old boy with primary
T-cell immunodeficiency (610163) who was found to have a homozygous
germline Q70X mutation in the CD3Z gene (186780.0001). CD3-zeta is
necessary for the development and function of T cells. Some of the
patient's T cells had low levels of the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex and
carried the Q70X mutation on both alleles of the CD3Z gene, whereas
other T cells had normal levels of the complex and bore the Q70X
mutation on only 1 allele of CD3Z, plus 1 of 3 heterozygous somatic
mutations of CD3Z on the other allele (186780.0002-186780.0004),
allowing expression of poorly functional T-cell receptor-CD3 complexes.
Thus the patient had both inherited and somatic CD3Z mutations as the
basis of the T-cell deficiency.

Rieux-Laucat et al. (2006) noted that the finding of somatic mutations
of a germline mutation in the CD3Z gene recalled somatic mutations of
germline mutations of the adenosine deaminase gene (608958), the
interleukin-2 receptor gamma-c gene (IL2RG; 308380), the
recombination-activating gene-1 (RAG1; 179615), the Wiskott-Aldrich
syndrome protein (301000), and the NEMO gene (300248). These somatic
changes could cause the mutant gene to revert to a wildtype gene or to a
sequence compatible with expression of the corresponding protein. In the
patient of Rieux-Laucat et al. (2006), these somatic mutations occurring
in the initially mutated codon were probably not due to a mutation
hotspot related to genomic instability, since these variants were not
found in other cell types from the patient. Furthermore, the T cells
with normal levels of the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex were polyclonal,
and each of the 3 somatic variants of CD3Z was found in different
populations of T cells, each with a distinct rearrangement of V(beta)
genes. This result indicated that the somatic mutations in CD3Z probably
occurred before the VDJ recombination process in T-cell progenitors. The
somatic mutations partially corrected the CD3Z deficiency, providing an
example of the modulation of T-cell immunodeficiency by somatic
mutations and of the selection of clones with such mutations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Class I MHC molecules, known to be important for immune responses to
antigen, are expressed also by neurons that undergo activity-dependent,
long-term structural and synaptic modifications. Huh et al. (2000)
showed that in mice genetically deficient for cell surface class I MHC,
due to deletion of either TAP1 (170260) or beta-2-microglobulin
(109700), or for the class I MHC receptor component CD3Z, refinement of
connections between retina and central targets during development is
incomplete. In the hippocampus of adult mutants, N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptor-dependent long-term potentiation is enhanced, and long-term
depression is absent. Specific class I MHC mRNAs are expressed by
distinct mosaics of neurons, reflecting a potential for diverse neuronal
functions. These results demonstrated an important role for these
molecules in the activity-dependent remodeling and plasticity of
connections in the developing and mature mammalian central nervous
system.

In mice chronically exposed to antigens of Porphyromonas gingivalis,
Bronstein-Sitton et al. (2003) observed that Ifng (147570)-dependent
Tcrz downregulation, due to lysosomal degradation, and impaired in vitro
T-cell function occurred in a way similar to that reported in a number
of infectious, autoimmune, and cancer pathologies. The in vitro findings
correlated with a deficient in vivo response, as assessed by reduced
immunity to influenza virus infection. Normal immune function and Tcrz
expression were regained after the cessation of chronic antigen
exposure.

By in situ hybridization of wildtype mouse retina, Xu et al. (2010)
showed that Cd3-zeta was preferentially expressed in the retinal
ganglion cell (RGC) layer. In Cd3-zeta -/- mice, the kinetics of RGC
dendritic elimination was markedly reduced, and the number of dendritic
protrusions was significantly increased during early postnatal
development. These defects could be mimicked in wildtype mice by
applying glutamate receptor (GLUR; see 138248) antagonists. Disruption
of RGC synaptic activity and dendritic motility was associated with a
failure of eye-specific segregation of RGC axon projections to the
central nervous system. Xu et al. (2010) concluded that CD3-zeta
regulates synaptic wiring and selectively impairs GLUR-mediated synaptic
activity in retina during development.

IMMUNODEFICIENCY DUE TO DEFECT IN CD3-ZETA
CD247, GLN70TER

In a 4-month-old boy of Caribbean origin with primary T-cell
immunodeficiency (610163), Rieux-Laucat et al. (2006) identified
homozygosity for a gln70-to-stop (Q70X) nonsense mutation in the CD3Z
gene. The premature stop codon was located within the first ITAM domain,
immediately upstream from the first YXXL motif, precluding expression of
all ITAM motifs and thus any interaction with the tyrosine kinase ZAP70
(176947). The boy's mother was heterozygous for the Q70X mutation. The
patient's other T cells had normal levels of the CD3 complex and bore
the Q70X mutation on only 1 allele of CD3Z, plus 1 of 3 heterozygous
somatic mutations of CD3Z on the other allele, allowing expression of
poorly functional T-cell receptor-CD3 complexes. The heterozygous
somatic mutations of CD3Z were Q70W (186780.0002), Q70L (186780), and
Q70Y (186780).

190195	TITLE *190195 TRANSGLUTAMINASE 1; TGM1
;;TRANSGLUTAMINASE, KERATINOCYTE; TGK;;
TRANSGLUTAMINASE, EPIDERMAL TYPE I
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The TGM1 gene encodes transglutaminase-1, a catalytic membrane-bound
enzyme that functions in the formation of the epidermal cornified cell
envelope, which acts as a mechanical barrier to protect against water
loss and infectious agents (Farasat et al., 2009).

CLONING

Phillips et al. (1990) determined the nucleotide and deduced amino acid
sequences of the coding regions of the human and rat keratinocyte
transglutaminase (protein-glutamine:amine gamma-glutamyltransferase; EC
2.3.2.13). The human and rat proteins have a molecular mass of about 90
kD and show 92% identity. Substantial similarities were demonstrated in
the human clotting factor XIII catalytic subunit (134570), guinea pig
liver tissue transglutaminase, and the human erythrocyte band-4.2
protein (177070). The keratinocyte enzyme is most similar to factor
XIII, whereas the band-4.2 protein is most similar to tissue
transglutaminase. A salient feature of the keratinocyte transglutaminase
is its 105-residue extension beyond the N terminus of the tissue
transglutaminase. This extension and the unrelated activation peptide of
factor XIII (a 37-residue extension) appeared to have been added for
specialized functions after divergence of the tissue transglutaminase
from their common lineage. Kim et al. (1991) identified mRNAs for all 3
types of transglutaminase (C, K, and E) and sequenced completely the
cDNA clones encoding the transglutaminase K enzyme. The deduced
813-amino acid sequence of the TGK protein shares 49 to 53% homology
with other transglutaminase proteins of known sequence.

Kim et al. (1992) demonstrated 2 variant forms of the TGM1 gene, the
rarer of which contains a 2-nucleotide deletion near the 5-prime end,
uses an alternate initiation codon, and differs from the common larger
variant only in the first 15 amino acids. Furthermore, they showed that
the DNA sequences of intron 14 possess several tracts of dinucleotide
repeats that show wide size polymorphism in the human population.

GENE STRUCTURE

Polakowska et al. (1992) and Kim et al. (1992) both demonstrated that
the TGM1 gene has 15 exons.

Yamanishi et al. (1992) placed the size at 14.3 kb. The translation
start was located in the second exon. The sizes of exons from 3 to 14
were markedly conserved between genes for human TGM1 and factor XIIIA,
another member of the transglutaminase family.

EVOLUTION

Polakowska et al. (1992) presented a likely phylogenetic tree for 7
known members of the transglutaminase family based on amino acid
sequence similarity. They also presented arguments suggesting that the
active enzyme evolved first, and the structural human erythrocyte
membrane protein 4.2 (band 4.2) evolved from the type II
transglutaminases.

Kim et al. (1992) demonstrated that the positions of the 14 TGM1 introns
have been conserved in comparison with the genes encoding 2 other
transglutaminase-like activities, although the TGM1 gene has relatively
smaller introns. On the other hand, the TGM1 enzyme is the largest known
transglutaminase, about 90 kD. It can be demonstrated that the
transglutaminase family of genes arose by duplications and subsequent
divergent evolution from a common ancestor and became scattered in the
human genome.

MAPPING

By the study of somatic cell hybrids, Polakowska et al. (1991)
determined that the TGM1 gene is located on human chromosome 14. Kim et
al. (1992) confirmed the assignment to chromosome 14 by study of somatic
cell hybrids and regionalized the assignment to 14q11.2-q13 by in situ
hybridization. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Yamanishi et al.
(1992) mapped the TGM1 gene to 14q11.2.

Van Bokhoven et al. (1996) found that the 3-prime end of the RAB
geranylgeranyl transferase alpha subunit gene (RABGGTA; 601905) overlaps
the promoter region of the TGM1 gene. Further analysis revealed that the
RABGGTA and TGM1 genes are located only 2 kb apart in head-to-tail
tandem arrangement. These 2 genes are functionally unrelated.

GENE FUNCTION

During terminal differentiation, mammalian epidermal cells acquire a
deposit of protein 10 to 20 nm thick on the intracellular surface of the
plasma membrane, which is termed the cornified or cross-linked cell
envelope (CE). The CE is the most insoluble component of the epidermis
due to crosslinking by disulfide bonds as well as by
gamma-glutamyl-lysine isodipeptide bonds that are formed by the action
of transglutaminases. Three different glutaminase activities have been
identified in mammalian epidermis and other stratified squamous
epithelial tissues. These include a ubiquitous tissue type II enzyme
called transglutaminase C (190196); a keratinocyte type I activity
called transglutaminase K, which is present in cultured epidermal
keratinocytes; and a so-called epidermal activity, transglutaminase E
(600238), which is present in hair follicles and advanced differentiated
epidermal cells. Transglutaminase K is membrane-associated, whereas the
C and E forms are soluble (Nemes et al., 1999). Transglutaminases are
defined as enzymes capable of forming isopeptide bonds by transfer of an
amine onto glutaminyl residues of a protein. Nemes et al. (1999) showed
that the membrane-bound form of the transglutaminase-1 enzyme can also
form ester bonds between specific glutaminyl residues of human
involucrin (IVL; 147360) and a synthetic analog of epidermal-specific
omega-hydroxyceramides. The formation of a lipid envelope approximately
5-nm thick on the surface of epidermal keratinocytes is an important
component of normal barrier function. The lipid envelope consists of
omega-hydroxyceramides covalently linked by ester bonds to cornified
envelope proteins, most abundantly to involucrin. In general the
findings indicated a dual role for transglutaminase-1 in epidermal
barrier formation and provided insight into the pathophysiology of
lamellar ichthyosis (LI; see 242300) resulting from defects in this
enzyme.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mutations in the TGM1 gene were found as the cause of autosomal
recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI1; 242300) of the lamellar form by
Huber et al. (1995) and by Russell et al. (1995). Huber et al. (1995)
were prompted to study TGM1 because of the finding that affected
individuals in 3 families exhibited drastically reduced transglutaminase
activity; in 2 of the families, expression of TGM1 transcripts was
diminished or abnormal and no TGM1 protein was detected. Homozygous or
compound heterozygous mutations of the TGM1 gene were identified in all
3 families (see 190195.0001-190195.0005). The results suggested that
intact cross-linkage of cornified cell envelopes is required for
epidermal tissue homeostasis. Russell et al. (1995) were prompted to
seek mutations in the TGM1 gene because of the finding that autosomal
recessive lamellar ichthyosis maps to 14q11 and shows complete linkage
with TGM1. In affected individuals from 2 unrelated families with the
lamellar form of ARCI1, they identified homozygosity for point mutations
in 2 adjacent arginine residues, R141H (190195.0006 and R142H
190195.0007). Within the transglutaminase family, these arginines are
invariant within a conserved region, distant from the catalytic site of
the enzyme.

Laiho et al. (1997) studied ARCI in the Finnish population, in which
they expected to find single mutations enriched by founder effect.
Surprisingly, 5 different mutations of TGM1 (arg141 to his, 190195.0006;
arg142 to cys, 190195.0004; gly217 to ser, 190195.0023; val378 to leu,
190195.0008; and arg395 to leu, 190195.0009) were found in Finnish ARCI
patients. TGM1 mutations were identified not only in patients with
lamellar ichthyosis but also in patients with nonbullous congenital
ichthyosis erythroderma. Moreover, haplotype analysis of the chromosomes
carrying the most common mutation, a C-to-T transition resulting in the
substitution arg142 to cys, revealed that the same mutation had been
introduced twice in the Finnish population. In addition to arg142 to
cys, 3 other mutations, in arg141 and arg142, had been described
elsewhere in other populations. These findings suggested to Laiho et al.
(1997) that this region of TGM1 is more susceptible to mutation.
Although the corresponding amino acid sequence is conserved in other
transglutaminases, mutations do not always cluster in this region;
mutations in coagulation factor XIII, for example, do not. A protein
model of the arg142-to-cys mutation suggested disruption or
destabilization of the protein. In transfection studies, the closely
related transglutaminase F13 protein with the corresponding mutation was
shown to be susceptible to degradation in COS cells, also suggestive of
the destabilizing effect of the arg142-to-cys mutation in TGM1.

Using microsatellite markers linked to the TGM1 gene, Pigg et al. (1998)
studied 43 Norwegian families with autosomal recessive congenital
ichthyosis, 36 with the lamellar form and 7 with nonbullous congenital
ichthyosiform erythroderma, and found a common haplotype for 2 markers
on 74% of disease-associated chromosomes. In 3 individuals homozygous
for the common haplotype, 2 with lamellar ichthyosis and 1 with
congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, homozygosity for a splice site
mutation in the TGM1 gene was identified (IVS5-2A-G; 190195.0002).
Screening of probands from the remaining 40 families revealed the splice
site mutation on 61 of 72 alleles associated with lamellar ichthyosis
and on 9 of 15 alleles associated with congenital ichthyosiform
erythroderma. These findings suggested a single founder mutation for
most patients with ARCI in Norway.

In African American twin girls with lamellar ichthyosis that spared the
face and flexural surfaces, Tok et al. (1999) identified homozygosity
for a missense mutation in the TGM1 gene (R315L; 109195.0033). In a male
infant of Italian extraction who had lamellar ichthyosis over his entire
integument, they identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in
TGM1.

In a Japanese boy with ARCI who displayed nonbullous congenital
ichthyosiform erythroderma consisting of fine gray or light brown scales
on an erythematous skin, Akiyama et al. (2001) identified compound
heterozygosity for a missense mutation and a 1-bp deletion in the TGM1
gene (190195.0011 and 190195.0012, respectively).

Cserhalmi-Friedman et al. (2001) analyzed the TGM1 gene in 10 ARCI
patients with the lamellar form of ichthyosis and identified compound
heterozygosity for 14 different mutations in 7 patients (see, e.g.,
190195.0014-190195.0020 and 190195.0024-190195.0026).

In a Japanese girl and a Korean boy with similar clinical histories and
ichthyosis in a distribution affecting primarily the trunk, Yang et al.
(2001) identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in TGM1
(190195.0021, 190195.0022, and 190195.0027).

Raghunath et al. (2003) described 2 sibs with ARCI who presented the
self-healing collodion baby phenotype; they had markedly diminished TGM1
epidermal activity and were found to be compound heterozygous for
missense mutations in the TGM1 gene (190195.0013 and 190195.0014).
Molecular modeling and biochemical assays of mutant proteins under
elevated hydrostatic pressure suggested significantly reduced activity
in G278R and a chelation of water molecules in D490G that locked the
mutated enzyme in an inactive trans conformation in utero. After birth,
these water molecules were removed and the enzyme was predicted to
isomerize back to a partially active cis form, explaining the dramatic
improvement of this skin condition.

Oji et al. (2006) sequenced the TGM1 gene in 10 ARCI probands from
Germany, France, Turkey, the Netherlands, or Morocco, who were were
primarily affected in a 'bathing suit' distribution, and identified
homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for TGM1 mutations in all
patients (see, e.g., 190195.0002, 190195.0007, and
190195.0029-190195.0032). Oji et al. (2006) observed that most bathing
suit ichthyosis (BSI) mutations are located in exons 5 and 6, leading to
an amino acid change in the first part of the catalytic core domain.
Digital thermography in healthy individuals showed a striking
correlation between warmer body sites and the 'bathing suit'
distribution of scaling, and in situ TGase testing in the skin of BSI
patients demonstrated a marked decrease of enzyme activity when the
temperature was increased from 25 to 37 degrees Celsius. Oji et al.
(2006) concluded that the bathing suit form of ichthyosis is caused by
TGM1 deficiency and that it is a temperature-sensitive phenotype.

In 8 South African black patients with autosomal recessive congenital
ichthyosis in a bathing suit distribution mapping to chromosome 14q11,
Arita et al. (2007) sequenced the candidate gene TGM1 and identified
homozygosity for a missense mutation (R315L; 190195.0033). Arita et al.
(2007) noted that the R315L mutation had been previously identified by
Tok et al. (1999) in African-American twins who had a more classic
presentation of lamellar ichthyosis in which skin scaling was very
extensive, sparing only the face and the flexures.

Aufenvenne et al. (2009) studied 8 of the TGM1 mutations that were
identified by Oji et al. (2006) in patients who had ichthyosis in a
bathing suit distribution (see, e.g., 190195.0029-190195.0032) as well
as 3 mutations associated with classic LI (see, e.g., 100195.0007).
Using fluorescence spectrometry, Aufenvenne et al. (2009) demonstrated
that both the BSI- and LI-associated mutations had decreased enzyme
activity compared to wildtype, but the BSI mutations exhibited a marked
shift in temperature optimum from 37 degrees Celsius to 31 degrees
Celsius, with residual activity ranging between 13% and 16.5% at the
lower temperature, whereas activity at 37 degrees Celsius was less than
10%. The mutations known to cause classic LI showed only activities
below 7.5%. Deficient activity of the BSI mutations could be
reconstituted by decreasing the temperature to below 33 degrees Celsius.
Aufenvenne et al. (2009) concluded that the striking distribution of
scaling in BSI is due to mutations that render TGase-1 sensitive to
temperatures above 33 degrees Celsius.

Farasat et al. (2009) identified TGM1 mutations in 57 (55%) of 104
patients with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis. Twenty-two
novel mutations were identified. The presence of a TGM1 mutation was
significantly associated with the presence collodion membrane at birth,
ectropion, plate-like scales, and alopecia. Patients with at least 1
truncating mutation were more likely to have severe hypohidrosis and
overheating at onset of symptoms compared to those with missense
mutations. There was a high frequency of mutated arginine codons, most
likely due to the deamination of CpG dinucleotides. The most common
mutation was an A-to-G transition in intron 5 (190195.0002), which
accounted for 28% of the mutated alleles.

In a French family in which 1 sister had a lamellar ichthyosis phenotype
and another sister presented a self-healing collodion baby phenotype
limited to an acral distribution, Mazereeuw-Hautier et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for 3 different mutations in the TGM1
gene (190195.0034-190195.0036, respectively).

Hackett et al. (2010) reported TGM1 mutations in 5 patients with ARCI
who were born with collodion membrane, 3 of whom went on to develop the
characteristic bathing suit distribution of ichthyosis (see, e.g.,
190195.0033), and 2 of whom developed a self-healing collodion baby
(SHCB) phenotype. The authors also reviewed the phenotypes associated
with the more than 40 reported mutations in TGM1 and noted that BSI and
SHCB mutations appeared to cluster in exons 5, 6, and 7 of the TGM1
gene.

In 16 Spanish ARCI families from Galicia, Rodriguez-Pazos et al. (2011)
analyzed 5 ARCI-associated genes and identified TGM1 mutations in 11
probands, all of whom exhibited the lamellar form of ichthyosis. Three
mutations accounted for 41%, 23%, and 14% of the TGM1 mutant alleles,
respectively (see, e.g., 190195.0038 and 190195.0039). Rodriguez-Pazos
et al. (2011) concluded that the high percentage of patients with the
same TGM1 mutation, together with the high number of homozygous probands
(64%), indicated the existence of a strong founder effect in this
population.

ANIMAL MODEL

Matsuki et al. (1998) generated mice lacking the Tgm1 gene and found
that they have erythrodermic skin with abnormal keratinization. In their
stratum corneum, degradation of nuclei and keratohyalin F-granules was
incomplete and cell envelope assembly was defective. The skin barrier
function of Tgm1-null mice was markedly impaired, and these mice died
within 4 to 5 hours after birth. These results clearly demonstrate that
the Tgm1 gene is essential to the development and maturation of the
stratum corneum and to adaptation to the environment after birth. Thus,
these knockout mice may be a useful model for severe cases of LI.

Using lamellar ichthyosis as a prototype for therapeutic cutaneous gene
delivery, Choate et al. (1996) used the human skin/immunodeficient mouse
xenograft model to correct the molecular, histologic, and functional
abnormalities of LI patient skin in vivo. They used
transglutaminase-1-deficient primary keratinocytes from LI patients
combined with high-efficiency transfer of functional transglutaminase
enzyme to regenerate engineered human LI epidermis on immunodeficient
mice. Engineered LI epidermis displayed normal transglutaminase
expression in vivo, unlike unengineered LI epidermis in which
transglutaminase activity was absent. Epidermal architecture was also
normalized, as was expression of the epidermal differentiation marker
filaggrin (135940). Engineered LI skin demonstrated restoration of
cutaneous barrier function measures to levels seen in epidermis
regenerated by keratinocytes from patients with normal skin, indicating
functional correction in vivo of the proposed primary pathophysiologic
defect in LI. The results confirmed a major role for transglutaminase in
epidermal differentiation and demonstrated a potential future approach
to therapeutic gene delivery in human skin.

TGM1, 1-BP DEL, 4640T

In a sporadic case of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI1;
242300) of the lamellar form, Huber et al. (1995) used SSCP and sequence
analysis of PCR products to demonstrate a homozygous deletion of a T at
position 4640 in exon 8 of the TGM1 gene. This change led to a
frameshift and a truncated protein of 442 amino acids that still
contained the active site but not the putative Ca(2+)-binding region.
Mutation strongly reduced the level of normal transcripts (detectable
only by RT-PCR) as reported for nonsense and frameshift mutations in
other genes. (The deletion occurred at the first nucleotide of codon
433, TGG, leading to a premature stop codon downstream.)

TGM1, IVS5, A-G, -2

In a sibship in which 2 sisters had autosomal recessive lamellar
ichthyosis (ARCI1; 242300), Huber et al. (1995) demonstrated
homozygosity for an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 3366 that converted
the canonical splice acceptor sequence from AG to GG. The cDNA products
showed the same A-to-G change found in genomic DNA and contained the
complete intron 5 sequence inserted into the normal transcript. This
inclusion of intron 5 led to a frameshift and created a premature stop
codon upstream of the sequences coding for the active site of the TGM1
enzyme.

Pigg et al. (1998) studied 36 Norwegian families with lamellar
ichthyosis and 7 with nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma
(ARCI1), using microsatellite markers linked to the TGM1 gene. One
common haplotype for 2 markers was found on 74% of disease-associated
chromosomes. Three individuals homozygous for the common haplotype, 2
affected by lamellar ichthyosis and 1 affected by congenital
ichthyosiform erythroderma, were analyzed for mutations in the TGM1
gene. All 3 patients were found to be homozygous for an A-to-G
transition located in the canonical splice acceptor site of intron 5.
Probands from the remaining 40 families were screened for this mutation;
the A-to-G transition was found on 61 of 72 alleles associated with
lamellar ichthyosis and on 9 of 15 alleles associated with congenital
ichthyosiform erythroderma. These findings suggested a single founder
mutation for most patients with these 2 phenotypes in Norway. The
mutation, which Pigg et al. (1998) designated 2562A-G, resulted in the
insertion of a guanosine at position 877 (876insG) in the mature cDNA
and the frameshift created a premature termination at codon 293. The
mutation was previously observed in 1 family (Huber et al., 1995) with a
resulting cDNA that included the entire intron 5, whereas in the
Norwegian patients, intron 5 was spliced but with only 1 intronic
nucleotide retained, suggesting that the mutation can result in variant
transcripts in different individuals.

Shevchenko et al. (2000) presented results from 5 families with the
intron 5/exon 6 splice acceptor site mutation. Affected members of 2
families were homozygous for the mutation, and those of the other
families were compound heterozygotes. Despite the diverse background of
these American patients, haplotype construction identified a common
founder chromosome spanning approximately 1.5 cM on 14q11. This
haplotype shared many of the alleles of the Norwegian haplotype, though
none of the patients claimed Norwegian ancestry. Genealogic information
from this ethnically and racially diverse group of patients provided
evidence that the founder chromosome may have arisen in the Westphalia
region of Germany. No association with congenital ichthyosiform
erythroderma was found in their study. Those patients who were
homozygous for the acceptor site mutation were less severely affected
than many of the compound heterozygotes. Shevchenko et al. (2000)
estimated that the IVS5-2A-G mutation originated in Germany and was
introduced in the Norwegian population around 1000 to 1100 A.D. They
also hypothesized that German families from Westphalia immigrating to
the United States introduced this mutation to the North American
population.

This mutation in the Norwegian families was reported by Pigg et al.
(1998) to result in an insertion of a G in the resultant mRNA (876insG).
In the Swiss family reported by Huber et al. (1995), the same A-to-G
substitution resulted in an mRNA product that retained the complete
intron 5 sequence in the normal transcript. In contrast, Shevchenko et
al. (2000) found that mRNA from their patients consisted of 2
transcripts: one with intron 5 inserted at the exon 5 splice represented
approximately 90% of the transcripts, whereas the other mRNA fragment
with the inserted G represented the remaining 10%. Failure of the
spliceosome to excise intron 5 was consistent with the loss of the
canonical AG sequence caused by the splice acceptor mutation. Shevchenko
et al. (2000) proposed a mechanism for the formation of the extra-G
transcript.

Farasat et al. (2009) identified the IVS5-2A-G mutation in 28% of
mutated TGM1 alleles from 57 American patients with LI, making it the
most common mutation in their study.

In a 16-year-old German boy with ARCI and his similarly affected
brother, who both showed a bathing suit distribution in infancy but
later displayed mild generalized ichthyosis, Oji et al. (2006)
identified compound heterozygosity for what they designated an 877-2A-G
splice site mutation in the TGM1 gene, and a 943C-T transition in exon
6, resulting in an arg315-to-cys (R315C; 190195.0031) substitution in
the first part of the catalytic core domain. Their unaffected parents
were each heterozygous for one of the mutations, neither of which was
found in 100 control chromosomes. Analysis of TGase-1 activity in
cryosections of patient skin was reduced in healthy skin areas and
abnormal in affected skin areas, showing only cytoplasmic and clearly
reduced TGase activity. The splice site mutation was also found in
compound heterozygosity with 2 distinct TGM1 missense mutations in a
2-year-old German boy with bathing suit ichthyosis and an unrelated
1-year-old German boy who had mild scaling, primarily in the axillae and
on the neck.

TGM1, SER42TYR

In 2 sisters with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis-1 (242300)
of the lamellar form, Huber et al. (1995) identified 3 mutations in the
TGM1 gene, 2 of which were inherited from their father, including a
950C-A transversion in exon 3, resulting in a ser42-to-tyr (S42Y)
substitution at a putative phosphorylation site located 5 amino acids
upstream of the cys cluster thought to be the membrane anchor region of
transglutaminase, and a 1399C-T transition in exon 3, resulting in an
arg142-to-cys (R142C; 190195.0004) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. The third mutation, inherited from their mother, was a 3549G-A
transition in exon 6 of the TGM1 gene, resulting in an arg323-to-gln
(R323Q; 190195.0005) substitution at a highly conserved residue. None of
the mutations were found in 50 controls. Because mutation analysis had
shown that regions adjacent to the cys cluster are important for
membrane attachment of the enzyme protein, Huber et al. (1995) suggested
that the S42Y mutation might explain the increased ratio of cytosolic to
membrane transglutaminase activity and protein observed in the 2
sisters.

Laiho et al. (1997) analyzed the TGM1 gene in Finnish patients with

affected members of 2 families. Compound heterozygosity for R142C and
another mutation in TGM1 was found in another 9 patients from 6
families, some presenting with lamellar ichthyosis and others exhibiting
nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (see, e.g., 190195.0006

In 2 affected sibs from a US Caucasian family with severe autosomal
recessive congenital ichthyosis (242300) of the lamellar form, Russell
et al. (1995) identified homozygosity for a 1489G-A transition in exon 3
of the TGM1 gene, resulting in an arg141-to-his (R141H) substitution at
a highly conserved residue. The mutation was present in heterozygosity
in the unaffected parents, who were not known to be related; however,
close questioning revealed a common ancestor 6 generations back. The
mutation was not found in 104 US Caucasian control alleles.

In a 1-year-old Finnish boy with nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform
erythroderma, Laiho et al. (1997) identified compound heterozygosity for
R141H and R142C (190195.0004). The authors also identified the R141H
mutation in compound heterozygosity with V378L (190195.0008) in an
11-year-old Finnish boy with lamellar ichthyosis.

In 2 affected cousins from a consanguineous Egyptian family with severe

1492G-A transition in exon 3 of the TGM1 gene, resulting in an
arg142-to-his (R142H) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The
mutation was present in heterozygosity in the unaffected parents, but
was not found in 102 Egyptian control alleles.

In a 35-year-old Dutch woman with ARCI in a bathing suit distribution,
Oji et al. (2006) identified compound heterozygosity for the R142H
mutation and a 376C-T transition in exon 3 of the TGM1 gene, resulting
in an arg126-to-cys (R126C; 190195.0030) substitution at a residue at
the beginning of the beta-sandwich domain. Her unaffected parents were
each heterozygous for one of the mutations, neither of which was found
in 100 control chromosomes. In situ TGase testing of an unaffected area
of the patient's skin demonstrated a marked decrease in enzyme activity
when the temperature was increased from 25 to 37 degrees Celsius. Oji et
al. (2006) concluded that the bathing suit distribution of ichthyosis
represents a temperature-sensitive phenotype.

In a 25-year-old Finnish woman with autosomal recessive congenital

ichthyosiform erythroderma, Laiho et al. (1997) identified compound
heterozygosity for a val378-to-leu (V378L) mutation in the TGM1 gene and
an unknown allele. The ichthyosis was accentuated in the palms and soles
and flexures and was associated with alopecia and ectropion. In a
10-year-old Finnish boy and an unrelated 11-year-old Finnish boy with
the lamellar form of ichthyosis, Laiho et al. (1997) identified compound
heterozygosity for the V378L mutation and an R395L mutation
(190195.0009) or an R141H mutation (190195.0006), respectively.

mutation in the TGM1 gene in compound heterozygous state with a second
unknown allele. In a 17-year-old Finnish female and a 10-year-old
Finnish boy, both with the lamellar form of ichthyosis, they identified
the same R395L mutation in compound heterozygosity with G217S
(190195.0023) or V378L (190195.0008), respectively.

In a 4-year-old girl with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis in a
'bathing suit' distribution (242300), Petit et al. (1997) identified
homozygosity for a 1144G-A transition in exon 7 of the TGM1 gene,
resulting in a val382-to-met (V382M) substitution at an evolutionarily
conserved residue in the core domain. The mutation was present in
heterozygosity in the unaffected parents and an unaffected brother, but
was not found in 50 unrelated controls. The patient had large brown
scales on the trunk, neck, and scalp, with sparing of the face and
limbs. Functional analysis of cultured keratinocytes demonstrated a
profound reduction of membrane-bound as well as cytosolic
transglutaminase (TG) activity in both affected and unaffected skin from
the patient compared to controls. Immunoblot analysis of cytoplasmic and
membrane keratinocyte extracts revealed no detectable TGK protein in
affected or unaffected skin from the patient, although Northern blot
analysis showed TGM1 mRNA of normal size and comparable amounts with an
age-matched control. Petit et al. (1997) proposed that other mechanisms
may compensate for TGK deficiency in unaffected skin, and suggested that
the regulation of the formation of the cornified envelope might differ
between these different areas of skin.

Akiyama et al. (2001) reported novel mutations in the TGM1 gene in a

The patient displayed nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma,
with fine gray or light brown scales on an erythematous skin. An in situ
transglutaminase activity assay detected markedly reduced
transglutaminase activity in the patient's epidermis. Electron
microscopy revealed incomplete thickening of the cornified cell envelope
during keratinization in the epidermis. Sequencing of the entire exons
and exon-intron borders of TGM1 revealed that the proband was a compound
heterozygote for 2 novel mutations, 9008delA (190195.0012) and arg388 to
his (R388H). The missense mutation R388H, resulting from a G-to-A
transition in exon 8 of the TGM1 gene, altered a conserved residue in
the center of the core domain of the protein. The frameshift mutation
9008delA, resulting in a premature termination codon at the tail of the
TGM1 peptide, was in the beta-barrel 2 domain (C-terminal end domain) of
the peptide, far from the active sites of the TGM1 molecule.

In 2 sibs with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (242300) who

diminished TGM1 epidermal activity, Raghunath et al. (2003) identified
compound heterozygosity for missense mutations in the TGM1 gene: G278R
(190195.0014) and D490G. The amino acid substitutions arose from a
G-to-A transition at nucleotide 3400 and an A-to-G transition at
nucleotide 7367, respectively. Molecular modeling and biochemical assays
of mutant proteins under elevated hydrostatic pressure suggested
significantly reduced activity in G278R and a chelation of water
molecules in D490G that locked the mutated enzyme in an inactive trans
conformation in utero. After birth, these water molecules were removed
and the enzyme was predicted to isomerize back to a partially active cis
form, explaining the dramatic improvement of this skin condition.

each heterozygous for one of the mutations, neither of which was found
in 50 unrelated controls. On his trunk, the patient had large scales and
mild erythema; immunofluorescence microscropy showed interrupted stratum
granulosum and stratum corneum staining, which the authors suggested
might be due to instability of mutant protein leading to higher
sensitivity to degradation.

TGM1, GLY392ASP

In a female patient with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis
(242300), Cserhalmi-Friedman et al. (2001) identified compound
heterozygosity for a gly392-to-asp (G392D) substitution and a 5-bp
deletion (1303del5; 190195.0024) in the TGM1 gene. The unaffected
parents were each heterozygous for one of the mutations, neither of
which was found in 50 unrelated controls. On her trunk, the patient had
large scales and moderate erythema; immunofluorescence microscopy showed
no detectable staining, confirming the marked reduction in protein
level.

heterozygosity for an arg142-to-pro (R142P) and a gln582-to-ter (Q582X;
190195.0025) substitution in the TGM1 gene. The unaffected parents were
each heterozygous for one of the mutations, neither of which was found
in 50 unrelated controls. On her trunk, the patient had large scales and
moderate erythema; immunofluorescence microscopy showed no detectable
staining, confirming the marked reduction in protein level.

heterozygosity for a val518-to-met (V518M) and a ser160-to-cys (S160C;
190195.0019) substitution in the TGM1 gene. The unaffected parents were
each heterozygous for one of the mutations, neither of which was found
in 50 unrelated controls. On her trunk, the patient had large scales and
moderate erythema; immunofluorescence microscopy showed positive
staining in the stratum granulosum and stratum coreum that corresponded
to a normal level of protein, but in vitro enzyme activity assay
revealed that mutant enzyme function was reduced to 30% of wildtype
activity.

heterozygosity for a gly94-to-asp (G94D) substitution and a -86C-T
transition (190195.0026) in the TGM1 gene. The unaffected parents were
each heterozygous for one of the mutations, neither of which was found

TGM1, ASN288THR

In a Japanese girl and a Korean boy with similar clinical histories and
ichthyosis in a distribution affecting primarily the trunk (242300),
Yang et al. (2001) identified compound heterozygosity for an A-C
transversion in exon 5 of the TGM1 gene, resulting in an asn288-to-thr
(N288T) substitution, and another missense mutation in TGM1. In the
Japanese girl, the second mutation was a C-T transition in exon 6,
resulting in an arg306-to-trp (R306W; 190195.0022) substitution, whereas
in the Korean boy, the second mutation was an A-T transversion in exon 2
of TGM1, resulting in an asp101-to-val (D101V; 190195.0027)
substitution. The unaffected parents were each heterozygous for one of
the mutations, none of which was found in 50 or more controls.
Three-dimensional structural prediction analyses revealed that these
missense mutations cause misfolding in the central catalytic core domain
of the transglutaminase-1 enzyme that would probably result in reduced
enzyme activity. Analysis of TGM1 activity in skin samples from the
Korean family showed that both cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of the
mutant enzymes had reduced activity, which was approximately 50% of
wildtype activity in the parents heterozygous for N288T and D101V,
respectively, with mutant TGM1 activity ranging from 5% in the membrane
to 15% in the cytosol in the compound heterozygous patient.

TGM1, ARG306TRP

See 190195.0021 and Yang et al. (2001).

In a 56-year-old Japanese woman with a mild form of lamellar ichthyosis
limited to the neck, abdomen, center of the back, and bilateral axillae
(242300), Akiyama et al. (2001) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
missense mutations in the TGM1 gene, a 3404C-T transition in exon 6,
resulting in an arg306-to-trp (R306W) substitution and a 2582T-A
transversion in exon 4, resulting in a leu204-to-gln (L204Q;
190195.0028) substitution. The patient's mother was heterozygous for the
R306W mutation; DNA was unavailable from her deceased father. Neither
mutation was found in 25 unrelated Japanese controls. Immunofluorescence
demonstrated reduced expression of TGM1 in the granular layer of the
patient's epidermis, with normal expression of TGM3. Considering the
distribution pattern of the skin lesions and the clinical history that
the affected areas enlarged in the summer and became smaller in the
winter, Akiyama et al. (2001) suggested that increased water content and
elevated pH in the stratum corneum might play an important role in
formation of lamellar scales in this patient.

TGM1, TYR276ASN

In a 14-year-old Turkish boy with autosomal recessive congenital
ichthyosis in a bathing suit distribution (242300), Oji et al. (2006)
identified homozygosity for an 826T-A transversion in exon 5 of the TGM1
gene, resulting in a tyr276-to-asn (Y276N) substitution in the first
part of the catalytic core domain. His unaffected first-cousin parents
were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 100 control
chromosomes. The patient had thick dark scales on the trunk, with
sparing of the limbs and face; the scaling was most pronounced in the
axillae. Ultrastructural analysis of affected skin revealed groups of
single polygonal clefts, the so-called 'cholesterol clefts,'
representing remnants of cholesterol crystals within the thickened
massive horny layer, whereas healthy skin from his right arm showed a
normal diameter of the stratum corneum and completely normal
ultrastructure. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that in the
patient's healthy skin, enzyme localization and activity were almost
normal, whereas in affected skin, activity was only present in the
cytoplasm and was clearly reduced. In situ TGase testing of the
patient's healthy skin demonstrated a marked decrease in enzyme activity
when the temperature was increased from 25 to 37 degrees Celsius.

Using fluorescence spectrometry, Aufenvenne et al. (2009) demonstrated
that the Y276N mutation not only has decreased enzyme activity compared
to wildtype but also exhibits a marked shift in temperature optimum from
37 degrees Celsius to 31 degrees Celsius: residual activity was 14.55%
at the lower temperature, whereas activity at 37 degrees Celsius was
less than 5%, and the deficient activity could be reconstituted by
decreasing the temperature to below 33 degrees Celsius. Aufenvenne et
al. (2009) concluded that the striking distribution of scaling in
bathing suit ichthyosis is due to mutations that render TGase-1
sensitive to temperatures above 33 degrees Celsius.

Using fluorescence spectrometry, Aufenvenne et al. (2009) demonstrated
that the R126C mutation not only has decreased enzyme activity compared
to wildtype but also exhibits a marked shift in temperature optimum from
37 degrees Celsius to 31 degrees Celsius: residual activity was 13% at
the lower temperature, whereas activity at 37 degrees Celsius was less
than 7.5%, and the deficient activity could be reconstituted by
decreasing the temperature to below 33 degrees Celsius. In contrast, the
R142H mutation (190195.0007) consistently showed activity below 5.5% at
either temperature. Aufenvenne et al. (2009) concluded that the striking
distribution of scaling in BSI is due to mutations that render TGase-1
sensitive to temperatures above 33 degrees Celsius.

14% at the lower temperature, whereas activity at 37 degrees Celsius was
less than 6%, and the deficient activity could be reconstituted by
decreasing the temperature to below 33 degrees Celsius. Aufenvenne et

TGM1, ARG315HIS

In 2 brothers from a consanguineous family of Moroccan origin with
autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (242300) in a bathing suit
distribution, Oji et al. (2006) identified homozygosity for a 944G-A
transition in exon 6 of the TGM1 gene, resulting in an arg315-to-his
(R315H) substitution at a residue in the first part of the catalytic
core domain. Their unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation, which was not found in 100 control chromosomes. The
16-year-old proband had moderate scaling on the trunk as well as on
particular areas of the limbs, whereas his brother had less severe
scaling with a similar distribution pattern.

Using fluorescence spectrometry, Aufenvenne et al. (2009) demonstrated
that the R315H mutation not only has decreased enzyme activity compared
to wildtype but also exhibits a marked shift in temperature optimum from
37 degrees Celsius to 31 degrees Celsius: residual activity was about
13.5% at the lower temperature, whereas activity at 37 degrees Celsius
was 6.25%, and the deficient activity could be reconstituted by
decreasing the temperature to below 33 degrees Celsius. Aufenvenne et
al. (2009) concluded that the striking distribution of scaling in
bathing suit ichthyosis is due to mutations that render TGase-1
sensitive to temperatures above 33 degrees Celsius.

TGM1, ARG315LEU

In monozygotic African American twin girls with autosomal recessive
congenital ichthyosis (242300) involving nearly the entire integument
but sparing the face and flexural surfaces, Tok et al. (1999) identified
homozygosity for a 1030G-T transversion in exon 6 of the TGM1 gene,
resulting in an arg315-to-leu (R315L) substitution at a highly conserved
residue within the catalytic core domain.

In 8 South African black patients with ARCI in a bathing suit
distribution, 5 of whom had previously been reported by Jacyk (2005),
Arita et al. (2007) identified homozygosity for the R315L mutation in
the TGM1 gene. Noting that the mutation was detected in all 8 DNA
samples and that several of the affected individuals belonged to the
Nguni ethnic groups (Zulu, Swazi, and Xhosa), Arita et al. (2007)
concluded that it likely represented a founder effect in this
population. The mutation was not found in 50 ethnically matched control
samples.

In a boy with ARCI in a bathing suit distribution, who was born of a
black South African mother and white Irish father, Hackett et al. (2010)
identified compound heterozygosity for the R315L mutation and a 1-bp
insertion (1331dupA) in exon 9 of the TGM1 gene (190195.0037), causing a
frameshift predicted to result in a premature termination codon. The
patient had collodion membrane with eclabium and ectropion noted at
birth, and in the first months of life developed lamellar scaling
involving large dark scales on his trunk with complete sparing of all 4
limbs and the face. Neither mutation was found in 100 control
chromosomes.

TGM1, VAL359MET

In a 7-year-old French girl with autosomal recessive congenital
ichthyosis (242300), who was born with a mild and transient acral
self-healing collodion baby phenotype, Mazereeuw-Hautier et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for a 1075G-A transition in exon 7 of
the TGM1 gene, resulting in a val359-to-met (V359M) substitution, and a
1187G-A transition in exon 8, resulting in an arg396-to-his (R396H;
190195.0035) substitution. Fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrated that
the V359M mutation had 12.8% of the activity of wildtype TGM1, whereas
activity of R396H was nearly abolished, at 3.3% of wildtype. The
proband's 9-year-old sister, who had ARCI of the classic lamellar type,
was compound heterozygous for the R396H mutation and a 7-bp deletion in
the TGM1 gene (1922delGGCCTGT; 190195.0036), involving the last 5
nucleotides of exon 12 and the consensus GT donor splice site of intron
12, predicted to cause abnormal splicing and causing a frameshift
resulting in a premature termination codon 34 amino acids downstream of
the deletion. Their unaffected mother was heterozygous for the R396H
mutation, and their apparently unaffected father was a compound
heterozygote for V359M and the 7-bp deletion; none of the mutations was
found in 100 unrelated Caucasian controls. Mazereeuw-Hautier et al.
(2009) noted that a transient and mild anomaly of the skin at birth
could not be ruled out in the father.

In 3 Spanish probands from Galicia with autosomal recessive congenital
ichthyosis (242300) of the lamellar type, Rodriguez-Pazos et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 2278C-T transition in exon 15 of the TGM1
gene, resulting in an arg670-to-ter (R670X) substitution in the
beta-barrel-2 domain. Another 3 Galician ARCI patients were compound
heterozygous for R670X and a 5-bp deletion (1223_1227delACACA;
190195.0039) in exon 8 of the TGM1 gene, and 1 additional patient was
homozygous for the 5-bp deletion. The R670X mutation accounted for 41%
and the 5-bp deletion for 23% of TGM1 mutant alleles in the Galician
population under study. These findings were consistent with a strong
founder effect in this population.

606244	TITLE *606244 SIGNAL-TRANSDUCING ADAPTOR MOLECULE 2; STAM2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cytokine signaling involves the recruitment of cytoplasmic kinases in a
cascade that leads to the activation of downstream target genes. The
signal-transducing adaptor molecules (STAMs) are associated with JAK3
(600173) and JAK2 (147796) and are involved in signaling for DNA
synthesis in response to interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) and
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF; 138960).

CLONING

By screening an EST database for sequences homologous to STAM (601899),
followed by probing an activated peripheral blood leukocyte cDNA
library, Endo et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding STAM2. Sequence
analysis predicted that the 525-amino acid protein is 50% identical to
STAM. STAM2 contains an SH3 domain, which is 89% identical to that of
STAM, and a C-terminal tyrosine cluster region that includes an
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif, or ITAM. Northern blot
and immunoblot analyses revealed ubiquitous expression of 1.3-, 3.9-,
and 6.8-kb transcripts and of a 68-kD protein. Immunoprecipitation and
immunoblot analyses detected tyrosine phosphorylation of STAM2 after
cytokine stimulation and an association of STAM2 with JAK2 and JAK3.
Like STAM, STAM2 was found to induce expression of MYC (190080) in
response to IL2 stimulation. Endo et al. (2000) suggested that STAM and
STAM2 may have compensatory functions upon stimulation with IL2 and
GMSCF.

By antiphosphotyrosine affinity purification of HeLa cell lysates
stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530), followed by
micropeptide sequence analysis and EST database searching, Pandey et al.
(2000) identified STAM2. Mutation analysis indicated that the SH3 and
ITAM regions of STAM2 are required for tyrosine phosphorylation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the STAM2
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP WI-20935).

612942	TITLE *612942 RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB25; RAB25
;;RAB11C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RAB proteins, such as RAB25, are members of the RAS superfamily of small
GTPases that are involved in membrane trafficking. Members of the RAB11
subfamily, including RAB25, control the return of internalized
membrane-associated moieties to the cell surface (Caswell et al., 2007).

CLONING

Goldenring et al. (1993) cloned rabbit Rab25. Northern blot analysis
detected Rab25 throughout the rabbit gastrointestinal tract and in lung
and kidney. RAB25 was also detected in human colon cell lines.

By searching databases for RAS family members, followed by PCR, He et
al. (2002) cloned human RAB25. The deduced 217-amino acid protein
contains 4 highly conserved GTPase motifs and an unconventional
C-terminal motif (CCISL) rather than the more common geranylgeranylation
motif found in other RAB proteins. Northern blot analysis detected a
major transcript of about 1.35 kb that showed highest expression in
pancreas, followed by kidney, placenta, lung, prostate, small intestine,
and colon. Little to no expression was detected in other tissues
examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Goldenring et al. (1993) demonstrated that recombinant rabbit Rab25
bound GTP.

Cheng et al. (2004) found increased expression of RAB25 in a significant
proportion of ovarian and breast cancers compared with normal tissue.
RAB25 overexpression was particularly associated with stage III and IV
serous epithelial ovarian cancers. Transfection of RAB25 into several
tumor cell lines increased anchorage-dependent and -independent cell
proliferation, prevented apoptosis and anoikis, including that induced
by chemotherapy, and increased aggressiveness of cancer cells in nude
mice. RAB25-induced inhibition of apoptosis was associated with reduced
BAK (600516) and BAX (600040) expression and activation of the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (see PIK3CA; 171834) and AKT (see AKT1;
164730) pathway.

Using human and other mammalian cell lines, Caswell et al. (2007) showed
that human RAB25 promoted cell migration on 3-dimensional matrices and
functioned to retain the dimeric integrin alpha-5 (ITGA5; 135620)/beta-1
(ITGB1; 135630) at the tips of extending pseudopodia. RAB25-dependent
tumor cell invasion depended on fibronectin (FN1; 135600),
alpha-5/beta-1 integrin, and direct interaction of RAB25 with beta-1
integrin. Caswell et al. (2007) concluded that RAB25 enhances the
ability of tumor cells to invade fibronectin-containing extracellular
matrices.

GENE STRUCTURE

He et al. (2002) determined that the RAB25 gene contains 5 exons and
spans over 9.4 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, He et al. (2002) mapped the RAB25 gene to
chromosome 1q12-q21.2. Cheng et al. (2004) stated that the RAB25 gene
maps to chromosome 1q22.

602738	TITLE *602738 KARYOPHERIN BETA-1; KPNB1
;;IMPORTIN BETA-1
DESCRIPTION The import of proteins into the nucleus proceeds through the nuclear
pore complex. Cytoplasmic proteins with a nuclear localization signal
(NLS) bind to an importin-alpha (see 600685)/importin-beta heterodimer.
The trimeric complex docks to the cytoplasmic periphery of the nuclear
pore complex and is subsequently translocated through as a single
entity. The import reaction is terminated by the direct binding of RAN
(601179) to KPNB, which dissociates the importin heterodimer.

CLONING

Gorlich et al. (1995) purified a 90-kD subunit of importin (importin-90)
from Xenopus egg extracts and obtained a 188-amino acid partial protein
sequence from internal peptides. Using the partial amino acid sequence,
they isolated cDNAs encoding human importin-90, or KPNB1, from a HeLa
cell cDNA library. The sequence of the predicted 876-amino acid human
KPNB1 protein is 93% identical to the 188-amino acid partial sequence of
Xenopus importin-90. Gorlich et al. (1995) showed that Xenopus
importin-60 and importin-90 cooperate to form an import receptor that
distinguishes functional NLSs from nonfunctional ones and selectively
binds import substrates to the nuclear envelope. Independently, Chi et
al. (1995) identified cDNAs encoding human KPNB1. Based on the 97-kD
product of in vitro translation, they designated the protein p97. Using
a monoclonal antibody against bovine p97, Chi et al. (1995) localized
p97 to the cytoplasm and nuclear envelope of bovine kidney cells. These
authors found that recombinant human p97 binds zinc and that a bound
metal ion is required for nuclear envelope-binding activity. Kutay et
al. (1997) identified the regions of KPNB1 that interact with RAN,
importin-alpha, and the nuclear pore complex.

GENE FUNCTION

The guanosine triphosphatase Ran (601179) stimulates assembly of
microtubule asters and spindles in mitotic Xenopus egg extracts. A
carboxy-terminal region of the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NUMA;
164009), a nuclear protein required for organizing mitotic spindle
poles, mimics Ran's ability to induce asters. This NUMA fragment also
specifically interacted with importin-beta. Wiese et al. (2001) showed
that importin-beta is an inhibitor of microtubule aster assembly in
Xenopus egg extracts and that Ran regulates the interaction between
importin-beta and NUMA. Importin-beta therefore links NUMA to regulation
by Ran. Wiese et al. (2001) concluded that this suggests that similar
mechanisms regulate nuclear import during interphase and spindle
assembly during mitosis.

The survival of motor neuron (SMN1; 600354) protein is mutated in
patients with spinal muscular atrophy. SMN is part of a multiprotein
complex required for biogenesis of the Sm class of small nuclear
ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). Following assembly of the Sm core domain,
snRNPs are transported to the nucleus via importin-beta. Sm snRNPs
contain a nuclear localization signal (NLS) consisting of a
2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (TMG) cap and the Sm core. Snurportin-1
(607902) is the adaptor protein that recognizes both the TMG cap and
importin-beta. Narayanan et al. (2002) reported that a mutant snurportin
construct lacking the importin-beta-binding (IBB) domain, but containing
an intact TMG cap-binding domain, localized primarily to the nucleus,
whereas full-length snurportin localized to the cytoplasm. Snurportin
interacted with SMN, Gemin3 (606168), Sm snRNPs, and importin-beta. In
the presence of ribonucleases, the interactions with SMN and Sm proteins
were abolished, suggesting that snRNAs may mediate this interplay. Cell
fractionation studies showed that snurportin bound preferentially to
cytoplasmic SMN complexes. Additionally, SMN directly interacted with
importin-beta in a GST-pull-down assay, suggesting that the SMN complex
may represent the Sm core NLS receptor predicted by previous studies.
The authors concluded that, following Sm protein assembly, the SMN
complex may persist until the final stages of cytoplasmic snRNP
maturation, and may provide somatic cell RNPs with an alternative NLS.

Using a library of endoribonuclease-prepared short interfering RNAs
(esiRNAs), Kittler et al. (2004) identified 37 genes required for cell
division, one of which was KPNB1. These 37 genes included several
splicing factors for which knockdown generates mitotic spindle defects.
In addition, a putative nuclear-export terminator was found to speed up
cell proliferation and mitotic progression after knockdown.

Caudron et al. (2005) reported that the spatial cues necessary for
microtubules to reproducibly self-organize during cell division are
provided by chromosome-mediated interaction gradients between the small
guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Ran and importin-beta. This produces
activity gradients that determine the spatial distribution of
microtubule nucleation and stabilization around chromosomes and that are
essential for the self-organization of microtubules into a bipolar
spindle.

Kalab et al. (2006) examined the Ran-importin-beta system in cells by
conventional and fluorescence lifetime microscopy using a biosensor,
termed Rango, that increases its fluorescence resonance energy transfer
signal when released from importin-beta by RanGTP. Rango is
predominantly free in mitotic cells, but is further liberated around
mitotic chromatin. In vitro experiments and modeling showed that this
localized increase of free cargoes corresponds to changes in RanGTP
concentration sufficient to stabilize microtubules in extracts. In
cells, the Ran-importin-beta-cargo gradient kinetically promotes spindle
formation but is largely dispensable once the spindle has been
established. Kalab et al. (2006) observed that the Ran system also
affects spindle pole formation and chromosome congression in vivo. Kalab
et al. (2006) concluded that conserved Ran-regulated pathways are
involved in multiple, parallel processes required for spindle function,
but that their relative contribution differs in chromatin- versus
centrosome/kinetochore-driven spindle assembly systems.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Bayliss et al. (2000) described the crystal structure of a complex
between KPNB1 residues 1 to 442 and 5 tandem FxFG nucleoporin repeats
from yeast Nsp1.

Lee et al. (2003) showed the crystal structure of importin-beta
complexed with the active form of SREBP2 (600481). Importin-beta uses
characteristic long helices like a pair of chopsticks to interact with
an SREBP2 dimer. Importin-beta changes its conformation to reveal a
pseudo-2-fold symmetry on its surface structure so that it can
accommodate a symmetric dimer molecule.

To provide a basis for understanding the crucial cargo-release step of
nuclear import, Lee et al. (2005) presented the crystal structure of
full-length yeast importin-beta (Kap95) complexed with RanGTP (see
602362). Lee et al. (2005) identified a key interaction site where the
RanGTP switch I loop binds to the carboxy-terminal arch of Kap95. This
interaction produced a change in helicoidal pitch that locks Kap95 in a
conformation that cannot bind importin-alpha (see 600685) or cargo. Lee
et al. (2005) suggested an allosteric mechanism for nuclear import
complex disassembly by RanGTP.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ayala-Madrigal et al. (2000)
mapped the KPNB1 gene to chromosome 17q21. By FISH, Matsuda et al.
(1996) mapped the mouse Kpnb1 gene to the proximal end of chromosome
11D.

610737	TITLE *610737 KINASE SUPPRESSOR OF RAS 2; KSR2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, followed by PCR of a human testis cDNA library,
Channavajhala et al. (2003) cloned KSR2. The predicted 829-amino acid
protein has a molecular mass of approximately 105 kD. Similar to KSR1
(601132), KSR2 appears to lack the CA1 domain. KSR2 shares 61% amino
acid identity with KSR1. Northern blot analysis revealed expression
mainly in kidney and brain. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that
KSR2 interacted with components of the MAPK pathway, including RAF
(RAF1; 164760), MEK (MAP2K1; 176872), and ERK (MAPK3; 601795).

GENE FUNCTION

Channavajhala et al. (2003) showed that both full-length KSR2 and the
C-terminal catalytic domain of KSR2 associated with COT (MAP3K8;
191195). Cotransfection of KSR2 with COT in HEK-293T cells lead to
reduced COT-mediated ERK activation in a dose-dependent manner; however,
RAF-mediated ERK activation was not significantly attenuated by
coexpression with KSR2, suggesting that the effect is selective.
Luciferase reporter assays showed that KSR2 inhibited COT-induced
NF-kappa-B (164011) activation but did not inhibit IKKB
(603258)-mediated NF-kappa-B activation. In vitro kinase assays showed
that KSR2 negatively regulated the kinase activity of COT. COT kinase
activity regulated IL8 (146930) production in HeLa cells, and
coexpression of KSR2 markedly reduced COT-induced IL8 production.

Channavajhala et al. (2005) showed that cotransfection of KSR2 with
MEKK3 (MAP3K3; 602539) in HEK293T cells significantly reduced
MEKK3-mediated ERK activation but did not affect ERK activation by other
MAP3Ks. KSR2 also significantly reduced MEKK3-induced NF-kappa-B
activation, to near background levels, in the IL1B (147720)-mediated
proinflammatory pathway and downregulated MEKK3-induced IL8 production
in response to IL1B stimulation. Channavajhala et al. (2005) concluded
that KSR2 specifically regulates the activity of MEKK3 and COT but not
other members of the MAP3K family.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Brennan et al. (2011) integrated structural and biochemical studies to
understand how KSR promotes stimulatory Raf phosphorylation of MEK. They
showed, from the crystal structure of the kinase domain of human KSR2
(KSR2(KD)) in complex with rabbit MEK1 (176872), that interactions
between KSR2 kinase domain and MEK1 are mediated by their respective
activation segments and C-lobe alpha-G helices. Analogous to BRAF
(164757), KSR2 self-associates through a side-to-side interface
involving arg718, a residue identified in a genetic screen as a
suppressor of Ras signaling. ATP is bound to the KSR2(KD) catalytic
site, and Brennan et al. (2011) demonstrated KSR2 kinase activity
towards MEK1 by in vitro assays and chemical genetics. In the
KSR2(KD)-MEK1 complex, the activation segments of both kinases are
mutually constrained, and KSR2 adopts an inactive conformation. BRAF
allosterically stimulates the kinase activity of KSR2, which is
dependent on formation of a side-to-side KSR2-BRAF heterodimer.
Furthermore, KSR2-BRAF heterodimerization results in an increase of
BRAF-induced MEK phosphorylation via the KSR2-mediated relay of a signal
from BRAF to release the activation segment of MEK for phosphorylation.
Brennan et al. (2011) proposed that KSR interacts with a regulatory Raf
molecule in cis to induce a conformational switch of MEK, facilitating
MEK's phosphorylation by a separate catalytic Raf molecule in trans.

;;TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEASE, SERINE 1; TMPRSS1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Hepsin is a cell surface serine protease.

CLONING

From cDNA libraries prepared from human liver and hepatoma cell line
mRNA, Leytus et al. (1988) isolated cDNA clones coding for a serine
protease called hepsin. The proteolytic enzymes of the serine protease
family exist as single- or 2-chain zymogenes that are activated by a
specific and limited proteolytic cleavage. They contain 3 principal
active-site amino acids, his, asp, and ser, that participate in peptide
bond hydrolysis. Among the best-studied serine proteases are those found
in plasma. These enzymes are involved in processes such as blood
coagulation, fibrinolysis, and complement activation. Tsuji et al.
(1991) showed that the hepsin mRNA is 1.85 kb in size and present in
most tissues, with the highest level in liver. It is present in the
plasma membrane in a molecular orientation of type II
membrane-associated proteins, with its catalytic subunit (C-terminal
half) at the cell surface and its N terminus facing the cytosol. Hepsin
is not found in cytosol. See also TMPRSS2 (602060), a related serine
protease.

MAPPING

Tsuji et al. (1991) mapped the hepsin gene to 19q11-q13.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Using cDNA microarrays, Dhanasekaran et al. (2001) examined gene
expression profiles of more than 50 normal and neoplastic prostate
specimens and 3 common prostate cancer cell lines. Signature expression
profiles of normal adjacent prostate, benign prostatic hypertrophy,
localized prostate cancer, and metastatic, hormone-refractory prostate
cancer were determined. Dhanasekaran et al. (2001) established many
associations between genes and prostate cancer. They assessed 2 of these
genes, hepsin, a transmembrane serine protease, and PIM1 (164960), a
serine/threonine kinase, at the protein level using tissue microarrays
consisting of over 700 clinically stratified prostate cancer specimens.
Expression of hepsin and PIM1 proteins was significantly correlated with
measures of clinical outcome.

In 3 different human cell lines, Guipponi et al. (2008) found that
TMPRSS1 was stably anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Since mutations in the TMPRSS3 gene (605511) cause a form of autosomal
recessive hearing loss (601072), Guipponi et al. (2008) systematically
investigated 16 TMPRSS genes as candidate genes for other forms of
hearing loss. No clear pathogenic mutations in the TMPRSS1 gene were
identified among 359 patients with sporadic hearing loss.

ANIMAL MODEL

To determine the functional importance of hepsin, Wu et al. (1998)
generated hepsin-deficient mice by homologous recombination. The
homozygous deficient mice were viable and fertile, and grew normally. In
functional assays, including tail bleeding time, plasma clotting times,
and tissue factor- or LPS-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation
models, no significant difference was found between hepsin -/- and
wildtype littermates. Liver weight and serum concentrations of
liver-derived proteins and enzymes were similar. Serum concentrations of
bone-derived alkaline phosphatase were approximately 2-fold higher in
hepsin -/- mice of both sexes when compared with wildtype littermates.
No obvious abnormalities were found in major organs in hepsin -/- mice
on histologic examination. The results indicated that hepsin is not
essential for embryonic development and normal hemostasis.

Guipponi et al. (2008) found that Tmprss1-null mice had poorly defined
or no auditory brainstem responses compared to wildtype mice at similar
decibel levels, indicating severe hearing impairment in the mutant mice.
Tmprss1 was found to be expressed in all inner ear tissues tested. The
protein was detected in spiral ganglion neurons but not in the organ of
Corti.

;;CD36 ANTIGEN-LIKE 1; CD36L1;;
CD36 AND LIMPII ANALOGOUS 1; CLA1;;
SCAVENGER RECEPTOR, CLASS B, TYPE I; SRBI; SRB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Scavenger receptor class B type I (SRBI) mediates the bidirectional
transfer of cholesterol between cells and high density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL) (summary by Vergeer et al., 2011).

CLONING

Using degenerate PCR, Calvo and Vega (1993) isolated a novel sequence
closely related to both the CD36 thrombospondin/collagen receptor
(173510) and to lysosomal integral membrane protein II (LIMPII; 602257).
This novel gene was termed CLA1 for 'CD36 and LIMPII analogous-1.' Calvo
and Vega (1993) isolated 2 alternatively spliced CLA1 cDNAs predicting
proteins of 409 and 509 amino acids from a human placenta cDNA library.
Calvo and Vega (1993) stated that the full-length CLA1 sequence predicts
a glycoprotein having 2 transmembrane domains, 2 short cytoplasmic
tails, and a large extracellular loop. They used immunofluorescence to
show that the protein is found on the plasma membrane. Northern blot
analysis revealed a 2.9-kb mRNA in several cell lines.

MAPPING

Calvo et al. (1995) used PCR analysis of human-hamster hybrids to map
the CD36L1 gene to human chromosome 12. They stated that CD36, CD36L1,
and CD36L2 represent a gene family, but that this family is not
clustered in the genome; these genes map to chromosomes 7, 12, and 4,
respectively. Cao et al. (1997) mapped the SCARB1 gene to 12q24.2-qter
by FISH. From the mapping of a QTL for internal carotid artery intimal
medial thickness with chromosome 12 to a site 161 cM from 12pter, it was
found by Fox et al. (2004) that SCARB1 is in close proximity.

GENE FUNCTION

High density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) are
cholesterol transport particles whose plasma concentrations are directly
(in the case of LDL) and inversely (in the case of HDL) correlated with
risk for atherosclerosis. LDL metabolism involves cellular uptake and
degradation of the entire particle by a well-characterized receptor
(606945). HDL, in contrast, selectively delivers its cholesterol, but
not protein, to cells. Acton et al. (1996) showed that the mouse HDL
receptor involved in this selective delivery of cholesterol is the class
B scavenger receptor they referred to as SR-BI. This receptor binds HDL
with high affinity, is expressed primarily in liver and nonplacental
steroidogenic tissues, and mediates selective cholesterol uptake by a
mechanism distinct from the classic LDL receptor pathway. The authors
distinguished this receptor activity from that of other HDL-binding
proteins (e.g., 142695). By analogy with the LDL system, a key missing
element in the study of HDL metabolism had been a well-defined HDL
receptor, which could give a molecular and cellular handle on the
system. The class B type I scavenger receptor was the first molecularly
well-characterized HDL receptor.

The murine scavenger receptor type B class I (SRBI) has affinity for
high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and mediates the selective uptake of
cholesterol esters. Murao et al. (1997) noted that SRBI shares 81%
sequence identity with the longer (509 amino acid) form of human CLA1.
By Northern blot analysis, Murao et al. (1997) demonstrated that the
2.9-kb CLA1 message is expressed most strongly in human adrenal gland
and also in liver and testis. Murao et al. (1997) suggested that CLA1,
like SRBI, could play a role in the metabolism of HDL. However, CLA1 was
also expressed in monocytes and, like SRBI, recognized modified forms of
low density lipoproteins as well as native LDL and anionic
phospholipids. Murao et al. (1997) found that CLA1 bound selectively to
apoptotic thymocytes. Murao et al. (1997) suggested that CLA1 may have 2
distinct roles, functioning both as a mediator of HDL uptake in the
liver and steroidogenic tissues, and having an alternative role in
leukocytes.

Murao et al. (1997) and Cao et al. (1997) demonstrated that SRBI is
expressed in humans at high levels in precisely those tissues that
previously had been shown to exhibit the bulk of selective uptake of HDL
cholesterol in vivo. The temporal and spatial expression of SRBI during
murine embryogenesis was consistent with a role of SRBI in delivering
cholesterol to the developing fetus. Additional correlative evidence of
a role of SRBI in HDL cholesterol metabolism came from studies of the
effects on SRBI expression of hormones, which induce or suppress steroid
hormone synthesis. To address the role of SRBI in HDL cholesterol
homeostasis, mice were generated bearing an SRBI promoter mutation that
resulted in decreased expression of the receptor in homozygous mutant
mice (Varban et al., 1998). Hepatic expression of the receptor was
reduced by 53% with a corresponding increase in total plasma cholesterol
levels of 50 to 70%, attributable almost exclusively to elevated plasma
HDL. In addition to the increased HDL cholesteryl esters, HDL
phospholipids and apoA1 (107680) levels were elevated and there was an
increase in HDL particle size in mutant mice. Metabolic studies using
HDL-bearing nondegradable radiolabels in both the protein and lipid
components demonstrated that reduced hepatic SRBI expression by half was
associated with a decrease of 47% in selective uptake of cholesteryl
esters by the liver, and a corresponding reduction of 53% in selective
removal of HDL cholesteryl esters from plasma. Taken together, these
findings strongly supported a pivotal role for hepatic SRBI expression
in regulating plasma HDL levels and indicated that SRBI is the major
molecular mediating selective cholesteryl ester uptake by the liver. The
inverse correlation between plasma HDL levels and atherosclerosis
further suggests that SRBI may influence the development of coronary
artery disease. See Krieger (1998) for a comparison of the HDL and LDL
receptor systems.

Ikemoto et al. (2000) identified an SRBI-associated protein from rat
liver membrane extracts by using an affinity chromatography technique.
The protein contains 4 PDZ domains (see 603199 for a discussion of PDZ)
and associates with the C terminus of rat SRBI by using its N-terminal
first PDZ domain; see 603831.

Scarselli et al. (2002) determined that SCARB1 is a receptor for
hepatitis C virus glycoprotein E2. Binding between SCARB1 and E2 was
found to be independent of the genotype of the viral isolate.

Using a genomewide RNA interference screen in Drosophila macrophage-like
cells using Mycobacterium fortuitum, Philips et al. (2005) identified
factors required for general phagocytosis, as well as those needed
specifically for mycobacterial infection. One specific factor, Peste
(Pes), is a CD36 family member required for uptake of mycobacteria, but
not E. coli or S. aureus. Moreover, mammalian class B scavenger
receptors (SRs) conferred uptake of bacteria into nonphagocytic cells,
with SR-BI and SR-BII (602257) uniquely mediating uptake of M.
fortuitum, which suggests a conserved role for class B SRs in pattern
recognition and innate immunity.

Vishnyakova et al. (2006) found that transfection of embryonic kidney
and HeLa cell lines with CLA1 and its splice variant, CLA2, enhanced
uptake of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
Lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid competed with E. coli K12 for
CLA1 and CLA2 binding. Transmission electron microscopy and confocal
microscopy analyses revealed cytosolic accumulation of bacteria in cells
overexpressing CLA1/CLA2. In the presence of antibiotics, E. coli K12
survived and replicated intracellularly, but synthetic amphipathic
helical peptides prevented E. coli K12 invasion. Peritoneal macrophages
from mice lacking Cla1/Cla2 showed reduced bacterial uptake, as well as
decreased bacterial cytosolic invasion, ubiquitination, and proteasome
mobilization, whereas bacterial lysosomal accumulation was unaffected.
Vishnyakova et al. (2006) proposed that these CLA1/CLA2-mediated
intracellular events may facilitate infection with certain intracellular
pathogens, such as hepatitis C virus, and/or represent a mechanism of
pathogen recognition, ubiquitination, and degradation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 77 subjects who were heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia
(143890), Tai et al. (2003) examined the association of plasma lipid
concentrations with 3 common polymorphisms of the SRBI gene, which is a
candidate gene involved in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. Two
polymorphisms, one in exon 1 and one in exon 8, were associated with
variation in plasma concentrations of fasting triglyceride. In addition,
the exon 8 polymorphism was associated with change in lipoprotein
levels. In agreement with animal studies, the data suggested a role for
SRBI in the metabolism of apolipoprotein B (APOB; 107730)-containing
lipoproteins in humans. Tai et al. (2003) suggested that this pathway
may constitute a backup mechanism to LDL receptor-mediated pathways for
the catabolism of these lipoproteins, and could be particularly relevant
in subjects with high levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins, such as
those occurring in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.

Decreased HDL cholesterol and raised triglyceride levels are well known
risk factors for atherosclerosis. McCarthy et al. (2003) examined
polymorphisms in the HDL receptor gene SCARB1 in 371 white patients with
coronary artery disease to determine their association with plasma
lipids. They found an association between a combination of genotypes in
women but not in men. McCarthy et al. (2003) concluded that genetic
variants in SCARB1 may be an important determinant of abnormal
lipoproteins in women and confer particular susceptibility to coronary
artery disease. They referred to the findings of Herrington et al.
(2002) that a differential response of HDL cholesterol to hormone
replacement therapy is dependent on the presence of genetic variants of
the estrogen receptor gene (133430.0004), and suggested that SCARB1
variants may also modulate the effect of hormone replacement therapy on
plasma lipid levels in women.

Acton et al. (1999) reported 3 common polymorphisms associated with
plasma lipids and body mass index. Osgood et al. (2003) hypothesized
that diabetic status may interact with these polymorphisms in
determining plasma lipid concentrations and particle size. They
evaluated this hypothesis in 2,463 nondiabetic (49% men) and 187
diabetic (64% men) participants in the Framingham Study. After
multivariate adjustment, they found a consistent association between the
exon 8 polymorphism and high density lipoprotein cholesterol
concentration and particle size. Interaction effects were not
significant for exon 8 and intron 5 polymorphisms. However, Osgood et
al. (2003) found statistically significant interactions between SCARB1
exon 1 genotypes and type 2 diabetes (125853), indicating that diabetic
subjects with the less common allele have lower lipid concentrations.
The authors concluded that SCARB1 gene variation modulates the lipid
profile, particularly in type 2 diabetes, contributing to the metabolic
abnormalities in these subjects.

Perez-Martinez et al. (2005) studied if a G-to-A polymorphism in exon 1
of the SCARB1 gene modifies the insulin sensitivity to dietary fat. They
studied 59 healthy volunteers. Steady-state plasma glucose after a
monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) diet was lower in G/A compared with
G/G subjects. Plasma nonesterified free fatty acid values were lower in
subjects carrying the less common A allele for all the diet periods. The
authors concluded that carriers of the G/A genotype have significant
increases in insulin sensitivity after a MUFA-rich diet compared with
G/G individuals. There were no homozygotes for the A allele.

Teslovich et al. (2010) performed a genomewide association study for
plasma lipids in more than 100,000 individuals of European ancestry and
reported 95 significantly associated loci (P = less than 5 x 10(-8)),
with 59 showing genomewide significant association with lipid traits for
the first time. The newly reported associations included SNPs near known
lipid regulators (e.g., CYP7A1, 118455; NPC1L1, 608010; and SCARB1) as
well as in scores of loci not previously implicated in lipoprotein
metabolism. The 95 loci contributed not only to normal variation in
lipid traits but also to extreme lipid phenotypes and had an impact on
lipid traits in 3 non-European populations (East Asians, South Asians,
and African Americans).

Vergeer et al. (2011) identified a missense mutation, P297S
(601040.0001), in the SCARB1 gene that was associated with elevated HDL
cholesterol levels (see HDLCQ6, 610762) but no other differences in
lipid profile parameters, atherosclerosis, or carotoid intima-media
thickness. However, carriers of the P297S variant showed decreased
platelet aggregation and a reduction in cholesterol efflux from
monocyte-macrophages. Carriers also had decreased adrenal
steroidogenesis. Khovidhunkit (2011) commented that the study by Vergeer
et al. (2011) did not distinguish whether the diminished adrenal
function in the carriers of the P297S mutation was primary or secondary,
and suggested measuring corticotropin levels to differentiate. Vergeer
et al. (2011) replied that there was no difference in median
corticotropin levels between the 15 P297S carriers and the 15
noncarriers, indicating that there was no pituitary defect. Vergeer et
al. (2011) suggested that the P297S mutation in the SCARB1 cholesterol
transporter directly impairs the adrenal uptake of cholesterol as a
substrate for steriodogenesis, leading to a primary defect in adrenal
function in human carriers.

Brunham et al. (2011) sequenced the SCARB1 gene in 120 Caucasian
probands with plasma HDL cholesterol levels at or above the 90th
percentile adjusted for age and gender, and in 80 Caucasian individuals
with HDLC below the 10th percentile, with no other lipid abnormalities.
In 2 probands with high HDLC, they identified 2 missense mutations
(601040.0002 and 601040.0003) that segregated with HDL cholesterol
levels in each family and were not found in the 80 individuals with low
HDLC levels or in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes databases.

ANIMAL MODEL

Miettinen et al. (2001) generated Scarb1 knockout mice and observed that
null females had abnormal HDLs, ovulated dysfunctional oocytes, and were
infertile. Fertility was restored when the structure and/or quantity of
abnormal HDL was altered by inactivating the Apoa1 gene or administering
the cholesterol-lowering drug probucol. Miettinen et al. (2001)
suggested that abnormal lipoprotein metabolism can cause infertility in
mice and may contribute to some forms of human female infertility.

SCARB1, PRO297SER

Among a cohort of 162 unrelated white participants with an HDL
cholesterol level above the 95th percentile (see HDLCQ6, 610762),
Vergeer et al. (2011) identified an individual who carried a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 889 of the SCARB1 gene, resulting in a
proline-to-serine substitution at codon 297 (P297S). This mutation was
not found in 150 normolipidemic controls. The proline at this position
is highly conserved across species. Vergeer et al. (2011) investigated
18 further carrier members of the proband's family and compared them to
36 family noncarrier controls matched according to BMI, sex, and age on
an aggregate basis. Carriers had significantly increased HDL cholesterol
levels (70.4 mg per deciliter vs 53.4 mg per deciliter in noncarriers; p
less than 0.001) but no significant differences in levels of other
plasma lipids. Vergeer et al. (2011) found no difference in the
prevalence of cardiovascular disease between carriers and noncarriers,
and no difference in carotid intima-media thickness. Among carriers,
Vergeer et al. (2011) identified decreased platelet aggregation in
response to different agonists compared with noncarriers, as well as
decreased adrenal steroidogenesis. Cholesterol uptake from HDL by
primary murine hepatocytes that expressed mutant SRB1 protein was
reduced by 56% of that of hepatocytes expressing wildtype SRB1 (p less
than 0.001).

In a 50-year-old Caucasian man with HDL cholesterol (HDLC) levels above

Brunham et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a 776A-G
transversion in the SCARB1 gene, resulting in a thr175-to-ala (T175A)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the large extracellular
loop. The mutation was present in the proband's 2 sons, who also had
HDLC levels above the 95th percentile, and in the proband's brother,
whose HDLC level was at the 71st percentile but who also had
hypertension and was taking medication that might influence the
phenotype. The mutation was not found in other family members with HDLC
levels less than the 95th percentile, in 80 unrelated Caucasian
individuals with HDLC levels below the 10th percentile, or in the dbSNP
or 1000 Genomes databases.

In a 51-year-old Caucasian man with HDL cholesterol levels above the

Brunham et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a 588C-T transition
in the SCARB1 gene, resulting in a ser112-to-phe (S112F) substitution at
a highly conserved residue in the large extracellular loop. The mutation
was not found in 80 unrelated Caucasian individuals with HDLC levels
below the 10th percentile, or in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes databases.
However, the proband's 76-year-old mother, who was also heterozygous for
S112F, had an HDLC level in the 15th percentile, with early-onset
cerebrovascular disease at 55 years of age as well as later coronary
artery disease. Analysis of 3 genes known to be associated with low HDLC
levels revealed that his mother also carried a heterozygous missense
mutation in the ABCA1 gene (V2091I), suggesting that ABCA1 mutations may
be dominant to SCARB1 mutations with respect to HDLC.

602863	TITLE *602863 WINGLESS-TYPE MMTV INTEGRATION SITE FAMILY, MEMBER 9A; WNT9A
;;WINGLESS-TYPE MMTV INTEGRATION SITE FAMILY, MEMBER 14; WNT14
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The WNT gene family consists of structurally related genes that encode
cysteine-rich secreted glycoproteins that act as extracellular signaling
factors. WNT genes are implicated in a wide variety of biologic
processes including cell fate determination and patterning in early
embryos and in cell growth and/or differentiation in certain adult
mammalian tissues. Bergstein et al. (1997) stated that all WNT genes
identified in mammals encode proteins of approximately 350 to 400 amino
acids with an amino-terminal secretory signal peptide followed by a
short domain of low sequence conservation and then by a large conserved
domain that includes 22 cysteine residues, the relative spacing of which
is exactly conserved in the majority of known WNT proteins.

CLONING

By PCR with degenerate primers, Bergstein et al. (1997) isolated 2 novel
members of the WNT family in humans, WNT14 and WNT15 (602864). WNT14
shows 75% amino acid identity to chicken Wnt14 and 54% identity to human
WNT15. Bergstein et al. (1997) reported that, based on both an unusual
cysteine spacing pattern and amino acid sequence comparison, WNT14 and
WNT15 are more closely related to Drosophila Wnt4 (603490) and hagfish
Wnt9 than to other members of the WNT family and may share common
ancestry.

During analysis of human genome draft sequence containing WNT3A
(606359), Saitoh et al. (2001) identified WNT14 gene fragments. Using
RACE and cDNA-PCR, they assembled a WNT14 cDNA sequence. WNT14 encodes a
deduced 365-amino acid protein containing an N-linked glycosylation site
and residues conserved among members of the WNT family. Northern blot
analysis detected a 4.4-kb WNT14 transcript at moderate levels in adult
skeletal muscle and heart and at low levels in placenta, adult lung,
pancreas, spleen, ovary, fetal brain, and fetal lung. Using cDNA-PCR,
Saitoh et al. (2001) detected WNT14 expression in gastric cancer cell
lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Hartmann and Tabin (2001) presented evidence that Wnt14 plays a central
role in initiating synovial joint formation in the chick limb. Wnt14 was
expressed in joint-forming regions prior to the segmentation of the
cartilage elements, and local misexpression of Wnt14 induced morphologic
and molecular changes characteristic of the first steps of joint
formation. Induction of an ectopic joint-like region by Wnt14 suppressed
the formation of the immediately adjacent endogenous joint, potentially
providing insight into the spacing of joints.

Guo et al. (2004) found that several Wnt genes, including Wnt4, Wnt14,
and Wnt16 (606267), were expressed in overlapping and complementary
patterns in developing mouse synovial joints, where beta-catenin
(CTNNB1; 116806) protein level and transcription activity were
upregulated. Removal of Ctnnb1 early in mesenchymal progenitor cells
promoted chondrocyte differentiation and blocked the activity of Wnt14
in joint formation. Ectopic expression of an activated form of Ctnnb1 or
Wnt14 in early differentiating chondrocytes induced ectopic joint
formation both morphologically and molecularly. In contrast, genetic
removal of Ctnnb1 in chondrocytes led to joint fusion. Guo et al. (2004)
concluded that the Wnt/CTNNB1 signaling pathway is necessary and
sufficient to induce early steps of synovial joint formation, and they
suggested that WNT4, WNT14, and WNT16 may play redundant roles in
synovial joint induction by signaling through the CTNNB1-mediated
canonical Wnt pathway.

GENE STRUCTURE

Saitoh et al. (2001) determined that the WNT14 gene contains 4 exons and
spans about 27 kb of genomic DNA. WNT14 and WNT3A are clustered in a
head-to-head manner with an interval of about 58 kb.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of a monochromosomal human-hamster somatic cell hybrid
DNA panel, Bergstein et al. (1997) mapped the WNT14 gene to human
chromosome 1. By FISH, Saitoh et al. (2001) refined the mapping to 1q42.

610637	TITLE *610637 MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED RING-CH FINGER PROTEIN 5; MARCH5
;;MARCH V
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MARCH5 is a ubiquitin ligase of the mitochondrial outer membrane that
plays a role in the control of mitochondrial morphology by regulating
mitofusin-2 (MFN2; 608507) and DRP1 (DNM1L; 603850) (Nakamura et al.,
2006).

CLONING

Poxviruses and gamma-2 herpesviruses express ubiquitin ligases called K3
proteins that inhibit the surface expression of glycoproteins, including
major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (see 142800). By
searching a database for sequences similar to the functional domains of
viral K3 proteins, Bartee et al. (2004) identified 9 human MARCH
proteins, including MARCH5. The deduced MARCH5 protein contains a short
N terminus, followed by a RING-CH domain and 4 transmembrane domains.
Immunofluorescence analysis showed that epitope-tagged MARCH5 was
expressed in an endoplasmic reticulum-like pattern.

By searching databases using MARCH2 (613332) as query, Nakamura et al.
(2006) identified MARCH5. The deduced 278-amino acid protein contains an
N-terminal RING finger and 4 C-terminal transmembrane spans. Western
blot and cell fractionation analyses showed that MARCH5 is an integral
membrane protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane.

Using RT-PCR, De Gassart et al. (2008) detected robust MARCH5 expression
in all human cells and cell lines examined, including immature and
mature dendritic cells, HeLa and B-cell lines, and monocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro and in vivo ubiquitination assays, Nakamura et al. (2006)
showed that MARCH5 had ubiquitin ligase activity in the presence of
UBCH6 (UBE2E1; 602916) or UBCH9 (UBE2E3; 604151) and catalyzed
ubiquitination of DRP1. Immunofluorescence studies showed that
overexpression of MARCH5 in COS-7 cells promoted formation of aberrant,
elongated mitochondria, and mitochondrial elongation could be prevented
by coexpression of an MFN2 mutant lacking transmembrane domains.
Expression of MARCH5 with mutations in the RING finger resulted in
mitochondrial fragmentation and accumulation of punctate mitochondria in
the perinuclear region. Immunoprecipitation analysis of transfected HeLa
cells showed that MARCH5 bound endogenous MFN2 and DRP1, including
ubiquitinated DRP1 species. Nakamura et al. (2006) concluded that MARCH5
binds MFN2 and DRP1, ubiquitinates DRP1, and modifies mitochondrial
morphology.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MARCH5
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP WI-11025).

605729	TITLE *605729 AT-HOOK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR AKNA; AKNA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The AT hook is a small motif with a typical 9-amino acid signature
sequence, in which a glycine-arginine-proline (GRP) tripeptide is the
center of the DNA-binding domain. AT-hook proteins such as ANKA bind
A/T-rich DNA and are thought to modify DNA architecture, thus enhancing
the accessibility of promoters to transcription factors (summary by
Siddiqa et al., 2001).

CLONING

By RT-PCR differential display with RNA from human B-lymphocyte subsets,
Siddiqa et al. (2001) isolated a cDNA encoding AKNA. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 633-amino acid protein contains an AT-hook motif
(RTRGRPADS) and 3 PEST regions. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.0-kb
transcript predominantly in lymphoid tissue, with highest expression in
spleen, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood leukocytes, lower expression
in thymus, and undetectable expression in fetal liver and adult bone
marrow. In addition, AKNA was expressed by B and T lymphocytes, natural
killer cells, and CD1A (188370)-positive/CD14 (158120)-negative
dendritic cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated a nuclear
localization in a B lymphoma transfected with AKNA-GFP.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed expression of AKNA predominantly in
germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs.

GENE FUNCTION

Using cDNA expression array, Northern blot, RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and
Western blot analyses, Siddiqa et al. (2001) observed AKNA-mediated
upregulation of CD40 (109535) expression and downregulation of GSTP1
(134660) expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis showed AKNA
binding to A/T-rich regulatory elements of CD40 and CD40 ligand (CD40LG;
300386), supporting a role for AKNA as a transcription factor that
coordinately regulates a key receptor-ligand pair during secondary
immune responses.

603727	TITLE *603727 GLUTAMINYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE; QARS
;;GLNRS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GLnRS is a class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (Lamour et al., 1994).
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are enzymes that charge tRNAs with their
cognate amino acids. The specificity of this reaction determines the
fidelity of mRNA translation. At least 1 synthetase exists in the
cytoplasm for each amino acid.

CLONING

Lamour et al. (1994) isolated cDNAs encoding human GlnRS. Northern blot
analysis detected GlnRS expression as an approximately 2.5-kb mRNA in a
variety of tumor cell lines. The predicted 775-amino acid protein
contains the HIGH and KMSKS sequence motifs characteristic of class I
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Human and S. cerevisiae GlnRS are 41%
identical. Both eukaryotic enzymes have a large N-terminal extension
compared to prokaryotic GlnRS.

EVOLUTION

Lamour et al. (1994) noted that GlnRS is present in eukaryotes but is
absent from many prokaryotes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts, in which
Gln-tRNA(Gln) is formed by transamidation of the misacylated
Glu-tRNA(Gln). Sequence comparisons revealed that the eukaryotic
glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS; 612799) has more extensive sequence
similarities with prokaryotic and eukaryotic GlnRS than with the
functionally homologous prokaryotic GluRS. Lamour et al. (1994)
presented evidence that bacterial GlnRS has a eukaryotic origin and was
acquired by a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Lamour et al. (1994) mapped
the GlnRS gene to chromosome 3.

HISTORY

Lamour et al. (1994) noted that a previously cloned gene (EPRS; 138295)
was originally considered to be GlnRS, but was subsequently shown to
encode a multifunctional protein with glutamyl- and prolyl-tRNA
synthetase activities.

607096	TITLE *607096 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 22 (URATE TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 12; SLC22A12
;;ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER 4-LIKE; OAT4L;;
URATE TRANSPORTER 1; URAT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The SLC22A12 gene encodes URAT1, a renal urate-anion exchanger that
regulates blood urate levels.

CLONING

Enomoto et al. (2002) isolated a SLC22A12 cDNA from a human kidney cDNA
library. The cDNA, which they called URAT1 for 'urate transporter-1,'
corresponds to a gene of 2,642 basepairs encoding a protein of 555 amino
acids that is 42% identical to OAT4 (SLC22A11; 607097). The hydropathy
plot predicts 12 membrane-spanning domains in URAT1, which are similar
to those in members of the OAT family. URAT1 has 3 consensus sequences
for N-glycosylation and 2 cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase
phosphorylation sites. High stringency Northern analysis revealed
predominant expression of URAT1 mRNA in the human adult and fetal
kidney, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that URAT1 protein is
prominent in epithelial cells of the proximal tubule of the renal
cortex. Under high magnification, the protein was found to be located in
the luminal membrane of the epithelium of proximal tubules but not in
that of distal tubules.

GENE FUNCTION

Enomoto et al. (2002) demonstrated that Xenopus oocytes injected with
URAT1 cRNA exhibited time-dependent transport activity of [14C]urate but
not of various typical substrates of OATs or organic cation
transporters. URAT1 was found to be a cotransporter with anions, in
particular chloride, bromide, or iodine, but not fluoride. Enomoto et
al. (2002) found that urate transport via URAT1 is inhibited selectively
by organic anions such as lactate, nicotinate, acetoacetate,
hydroxybutyrate, and succinate. Para-aminohippurate (PAH), the
representative substrate of OATs, did not exert an inhibitory effect on
urate uptake via URAT1, consistent with the observation that PAH has no
effect on the fractional excretion of urate in humans. Benzbromarone,
probenecid, phenylbutazone, sulfinpyrazone, nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs, and diuretics inhibited urate uptake.
Trans-stimulation experiments indicated that the major counteranions
that exchange for urate via URAT1 are organic anions rather than
inorganic chloride.

Thangaraju et al. (2006) found the urinary excretion of urate was
significantly elevated in Cebpd (116898) -/- mice, although expression
of Urat1 was unaltered. However, expression of the Na(+)/lactate
cotransporters Slc5a8 (608044) and Slc5a12 (612455) was almost
completely ablated in Cebpd -/- mice. Thangaraju et al. (2006) proposed
that lactate reabsorption by SLC5A8 and SLC5A12 is coupled to urate
reabsorption by URAT1 at the proximal tubule apical membrane.

MAPPING

Enomoto et al. (2002) identified a sequence representing the SLC22A12
gene within a BAC clone (GenBank GENBANK AC044790) mapping to chromosome
11q13, near the SLC22A11 gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with renal hypouricemia (220150), Enomoto et al. (2002) and
Tanaka et al. (2003) identified mutations in the SLC22A12 gene
(607096.0001-607096.0003).

Ichida et al. (2008) identified SLC22A12 mutations in 66 of 71 71
Japanese patients with hypouricemia. The W258X mutation (607096.0001)
was by far the most common mutation, occurring in 93 alleles, including
31 homozygotes and 23 compound heterozygotes. A total of 13 mutations,
including 3 novel mutations, were identified (see, e.g. 607096.0005;
607096.0006). Acute renal failure and urolithiasis occurred in 21.1% and
8.5% of patients, respectively. Three patients had chronic renal
failure. By haplotype analysis, Ichida et al. (2008) found that W258X
was a founder mutation with an estimated age of 6,820 years.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, TRP258TER

In a 48-year-old male with idiopathic renal hypouricemia (220150),
Enomoto et al. (2002) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 774
within exon 4 of the SLC22A12 gene, resulting in a tryptophan-to-stop
substitution at codon 258 (W258X). This mutation was found in
homozygosity and was not identified in 180 randomly chosen control
Japanese individuals.

In 2 brothers with hereditary renal hypouricemia and exercise-induced
acute renal failure, Tanaka et al. (2003) identified homozygosity for
the W258X mutation. The parents of the sibs and all of the sibs' 5
children were heterozygous for the mutation.

By haplotype analysis of 31 Japanese individuals homozygous for the
W258X mutation, Ichida et al. (2008) estimated that the mutation is
about 6,820 years old. This mutation dates back from between the time
when the Jomon people predominated in Japan and the time when the Yayoi
people started to migrate to Japan from the Korean peninsula.

(2002) identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 650 in exon 3 of the
SLC22A12 gene, resulting in a threonine-to-methionine substitution at
codon 217 (T217M). This mutation was found in homozygosity and was not
identified in any of 180 randomly chosen control Japanese individuals.

SLC22A12, GLU298ASP

In a patient with idiopathic renal hypouricemia (220150), Enomoto et al.
(2002) identified a G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 894 in exon 5 of
the SLC22A12 gene, resulting in a glutamic acid-to-aspartic acid
substitution at codon 298 (E298D). This mutation was found in
homozygosity and was not identified in any of 180 randomly chosen
control Japanese individuals.

HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, LEU418ARG

In the affected member of a Japanese family with renal hypouricemia
(220150), Wakida et al. (2005) detected compound heterozygosity for
W258X (607096.0001) and for a novel mutation, a 1253T-G transversion in
the SLC22A12 gene that resulted in a leu418-to-arg (L418R) substitution
in the tenth transmembrane domain of the protein. The L418R mutation had
significantly reduced urate-transporting activities compared with
wildtype (P less than 0.05), suggesting that it is a loss-of-function
mutation.

HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, ARG90HIS

In a Japanese man with renal hypouricemia (220150), Ichida et al. (2008)
identified a homozygous 269G-A transition in the SLC22A12 gene,
resulting in an arg90-to-his (R90H) substitution. Nine additional
affected individuals were compound heterozygous for R90H and W258X
(607096.0001).

.0006
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, GLY361VAL

In 2 unrelated Japanese individuals with renal hypouricemia (220150),
Ichida et al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations
in the SLC22A12 gene: a 1082G-T transversion resulting in a
gly361-to-val (G361V) substitution, and W258X (607096.0001). In vitro
functional expression assays showed that the G361V-mutant protein had
decreased uric acid transport activity.

;;FAT TISSUE-SPECIFIC LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT PROTEIN; FALP;;
CHROMOSOME 21 OPEN READING FRAME 61; C21ORF61
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Melanocortin receptors (MCRs; see 155555) are G protein-coupled
receptors with diverse physiologic functions. MRAP and MRAP2 (615410)
are accessory proteins responsible for melanocortin receptor targeting
and function (Chan et al., 2009).

CLONING

In a search for novel proteins that were differentially expressed during
adipose conversion, Xu et al. (2002) detected a fat tissue-specific low
molecular weight protein (Falp) in mouse adipocytes at day 8 after
differentiation, but not in preadipocytes, by 2-dimensional gel
electrophoresis. They identified the human homolog by sequence
comparison. Analysis by RACE demonstrated that the human FALP gene
encodes 2 isoforms, FALP-alpha and FALP-beta. The FALP-alpha and
FALP-beta transcripts differ in their 3-prime terminal exons and encode
173- and 102-amino acid isoforms, respectively. FALP-alpha and FALP-beta
share a common N terminus containing a transmembrane region, but they
have distinct C termini. The transmembrane domain is conserved in mouse
Falp. Immunofluorescent analyses of mouse adipocytes showed that Falp
strictly localizes at a compact perinuclear membrane compartment.
Treatment of cells with insulin (176730) induced the redistribution of
Falp into numerous discrete spotty structures spreading throughout the
cytoplasm. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues showed expression
predominantly in white and brown adipose tissue.

Using RT-PCR, Metherell et al. (2005) detected highest expression of
both MRAP-alpha and MRAP-beta in adrenal gland. In other tissues, the
variants showed variable and tissue-specific expression. Other than
adrenal gland, MRAP-alpha showed highest expression in testis, breast,
thyroid, lymph node, and ovary, with weaker expression in fat, heart,
skin, jejunum, ileum, liver, stomach, and pituitary. In addition to
adrenal gland, MRAP-beta showed highest expression in breast and testis,
with lower expression in skin, brain, jejunum, ovary, and fat. Little to
no expression of either variant was detected in other tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Metherell et al. (2005) found that FALP and melanocortin-2 receptor
(MC2R; 607397) interacted and that both colocalized in endoplasmic
reticulum and plasma membrane. Therefore, they renamed FALP
'melanocortin-2 receptor accessory protein' (MRAP). They stated that
MRAP was required for MC2R expression in certain cell types, supporting
the idea that MRAP has a role in the processing, trafficking, or
function of MC2R.

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis of transfected CHO cells, Chan et al.
(2009) found that MRAP and MRAP2 formed homodimers and heterodimers.
Both proteins interacted with all MCRs examined. Both MRAP and MRAP2
showed similar functions in inhibiting or inducing cell surface
expression of individual MCRs and in their effects on MCR
ligand-dependent cAMP production.

Using fluorescence-tagged proteins expressed in CHO cells, Sebag and
Hinkle (2010) found that both MRAP and MRAP2 formed antiparallel
homodimers, with proteins inserted into the membrane in opposing
orientations. MRAP and MRAP2 also formed antiparallel heterodimers when
coexpressed. Both MRAP and MRAP2 escorted MC2R to the plasma membrane.
However, MRAP was essential for activation of MC2R signaling, whereas
MRAP2 functioned in a dominant-negative manner to inhibit MRAP-dependent
MC2R activation. Neither MRAP nor MRAP2 had any effect on alpha-MSH
(176830) binding to MC2R or on alpha-MSH-dependent MC2R activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Metherell et al. (2005) stated that the MRAP gene contains 6 exons that
extend 23 kb. MRAP-alpha, derived from exons 1 through 5, encodes a
172-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 19 kD;
MRAP-beta, derived from exons 1 through 4 and 6, encodes a 102-amino
acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 14.1 kD.

MAPPING

Xu et al. (2002) identified the MRAP gene at chromosome 21q22.1 by
sequence analysis. Metherell et al. (2005) identified the MRAP gene as
mutant in the form of familial glucocorticoid deficiency that maps to
21q22.1 (FGD2; 607398).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD), or hereditary unresponsiveness
to adrenocorticotropin (202200), is an autosomal recessive disorder
resulting from resistance to the action of ACTH on the adrenal cortex,
which normally stimulates glucocorticoid production. Affected
individuals are deficient in cortisol and, if untreated, are likely to
succumb to hypoglycemia or overwhelming infection in infancy or
childhood. Mutations of the ACTH receptor (melanocortin-2 receptor,
MC2R; 607397), account for approximately 25% of cases of familial
glucocorticoid deficiency. Several consanguineous families including 1
or more members with FGD whose disease did not segregate with either
MC2R or a locus at 8q12.1-q21.2 (609197) had been identified. In 1 such
family, Metherell et al. (2005) carried out a whole-genome scan by
microarray analysis of SNPs with genomic DNA from the parents, affected
children, and unaffected sibs. They identified a single candidate region
at 21q22.1 extending over a 2.75-Mbp region that gave a maximum lod
score of 2.64. Homozygosity of this region was confirmed and its size
was reduced to 2.2 Mbp in this and in another consanguineous family with
a single affected individual. Of 30 candidate genes located in the
critical region, only 1, MRAP, was expressed in the adrenal cortex but
not in liver or brain. Metherell et al. (2005) screened the entire exon
sequence and the relevant flanking intronic regions by DNA sequencing in
2 families showing linkage of glucocorticoid deficiency to 21q22.1
(GCCD2; 607398). Splice site mutations were identified in each of the 2
families, in each case involving nucleotide +1 of the donor site of
intron 3 (609196.0001, 609196.0002); another mutation at this position
was identified in an unrelated individual (609196.0003). Six other
individuals from 5 families carried a deletion, IVS3DS+1delG
(609196.0004). In 4 individuals from 3 families a 1-bp insertion at the
intron 3 donor site was found (609196.0005). Nine individuals from 8
families carried the missense mutation M1I (609196.0006) and 1
individual carried the nonsense mutation V44X (609196.0007). All of
these homozygous changes cosegregated with the disease and were not
found in 120 control chromosomes.

In the proband of a family with glucocorticoid deficiency mapping to
chromosome 21q22.1 (607398) and in 2 affected sibs, Metherell et al.
(2005) found a homozygous G-to-T transversion at the splice donor site
of intron 3 of the MRAP gene (IVS3DS+1G-T).

.0002

Metherell et al. (2005) found a G-to-C transversion at the splice donor
site of intron 3 of the MRAP gene (IVS3DS+1G-C). This mutation was also
found in an unrelated affected individual.

.0003
GLUCOCORTICOID DEFICIENCY 2

3 of the MRAP gene (IVS3DS+1G-A).

.0004
GLUCOCORTICOID DEFICIENCY 2
MRAP, IVS3, G DEL, +1

In 6 individuals from 5 families with glucocorticoid deficiency
(607398), Metherell et al. (2005) found deletion of the first nucleotide
in the donor site of intron 3 of the MRAP gene (IVS3DS+1delG). This was
the second most frequent mutation causing glucocorticoid deficiency
unrelated to defect in the MC2R gene (see 202200) in their study.

.0005
GLUCOCORTICOID DEFICIENCY 2
MRAP, IVS3, T INS, +3

In 4 individuals from 3 families with glucocorticoid deficiency
(607398), Metherell et al. (2005) found an insertion of a T nucleotide
at the splice donor site of intron 3 of the MRAP gene (IVS3insT+3).

.0006
GLUCOCORTICOID DEFICIENCY 2
MRAP, MET1ILE

Metherell et al. (2005) found the missense mutation met1-to-ile (M1I) in
the MRAP gene in 9 individuals from 8 families with glucocorticoid
deficiency (607398), making this the most frequent mutation causing
glucocorticoid deficiency unrelated to defect in the MC2R gene (see
202200) in their study.

.0007
GLUCOCORTICOID DEFICIENCY 2
MRAP, 1-BP DEL, 128G

In an individual with glucocorticoid deficiency (607398), Metherell et
al. (2005) found homozygous deletion of a G nucleotide at position 128
of the MRAP gene, resulting in premature termination of the protein
(val44 to ter; V44X). This was the only MRAP mutation located in exon 4
found in their study.

.0008
GLUCOCORTICOID DEFICIENCY 2
MRAP, 7-BP DEL, NT17

Modan-Moses et al. (2006) reported a Jewish Ethiopian family with
glucocorticoid deficiency (607398). The proband presented at the age of
19 months with hypocortisolism, severe psychomotor retardation,
myoclonic seizures, spastic quadriparesis, and microcephaly. Before a
definite diagnosis was made, a female sib was born in another hospital
and succumbed during the neonatal period due to sepsis and adrenal
crisis. The proband was diagnosed and found to be homozygous for a novel
MRAP mutation, a seven-base deletion in exon 3 (ACGCCTC). This deletion
caused a frameshift, resulting in a stop codon after 23 amino acids
(L31X). The sister of the proband carried the same mutation.

609295	TITLE *609295 SEMAPHORIN 6D; SEMA6D
;;KIAA1479
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned SEMA6D, which they designated
KIAA1479. RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression in adult whole brain,
spinal cord, and most specific adult brain regions examined. Somewhat
lower expression was detected in fetal brain and adult ovary, and most
other tissues showed intermediate expression, with the lowest level in
testis.

By searching databases for sequences similar to SEMA6C (609294),
followed by RT-PCR and 5-prime RACE, Qu et al. (2002) cloned 5 SEMA6D
splice variants. The 4 long variants, designated SEMA6D.1 through
SEMA6D.4, encode deduced proteins of 998 to 1,073 amino acids. All 4
contain an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by a class VI SEMA
domain, a PSI domain with a cysteine-rich motif, a transmembrane
segment, and a long cytoplasmic region. SEMA6D.1 also has 9 potential
N-glycosylation sites. The long variants differ in amino acid sequence
between the extracellular PSI domain and the transmembrane domain. A
short variant, designated SEMA6Ds, encodes a truncated 476-amino acid
protein with only the signal sequence and SEMA domain. By Northern blot
analysis using a sequence common to all SEMA6D variants as probe, Qu et
al. (2002) detected a major 6.5-kb transcript and a second 5.0-kb
transcript. The 6.5-kb transcript was expressed abundantly in kidney,
brain, and placenta, moderately in heart and skeletal muscle, and weakly
in lung, colon, and small intestine. Expression was barely detectable in
other tissues. The 5.0-kb transcript was expressed faintly in kidney,
skeletal muscle, heart, and placenta and was barely detectable in all
other tissues. RT-PCR using variant-specific primers showed that
SEMA6D.1 was the major transcript in all tissues examined except
placenta. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos detected Sema6d
expression beginning at embryonic day 13, with widespread expression in
brain and spinal cord. Labeling of cultured rat spinal cord neurons
showed expression in neural perikaryon, processes, and termini, but no
labeling of nuclei or axons. Transient transfection of SEMA6D.1 in COS-7
cells resulted in expression of a cytoplasmic protein of about 67.1 kD
and a secreted protein of about 80 kD, suggesting modification after
secretion. SEMA6D.1 was also expressed on the cell surface. SEMA6Ds
showed a punctate cytoplasmic distribution, with accumulation at the 2
ends of many cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Qu et al. (2002) exposed chicken embryo dorsal root ganglion explants
and neonatal rat cortical and hippocampal neurons to SEMA6D secreted
from transfected COS-7 cells and found that SEMA6D induced growth cone
collapse. SEMA6D also inhibited axonal extension in a nerve growth
factor (NGF; see 162030)-differentiated rat pheochromocytoma cell line.

GENE STRUCTURE

Qu et al. (2002) determined that the SEMA6D contains at least 19
alternatively spliced exons and spans about 58 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Qu et al. (2002) mapped the SEMA6D gene to
chromosome 15q21.1.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Strand et al. (1995) stated that in Drosophila more than 50 tumor
suppressor genes have been identified by mutations causing tissue
overgrowth during development (see 600723). Recessive mutations in these
genes interrupt the differentiation of primordial cells and result in
excessive cell proliferation. These malignancies occur in either the
presumptive adult optic centers of the larval brain, the imaginal discs,
or the hematopoietic organs. The development of the mutant animals is
arrested and they die as larvae or pseudopupae. Inactivation of the
tumor suppressor gene 'lethal(2) giant larvae' (D-lgl) of Drosophila
leads to malignant transformation of the presumptive adult optic centers
in the larval brain and tumors of the imaginal discs. These malignancies
result from the disorganization of a cytoskeletal network in which the
D-LGL protein participates. Strand et al. (1995) described the isolation
of a cDNA encoding the human homolog of the D-LGL gene, which they
designated HUGL. In Northern blots the cDNA recognized a 4.5-kb RNA
transcript. The HUGL gene (also symbolized LLGL) is expressed in brain,
kidney, and muscle but is barely seen in heart and placenta. The HUGL
cDNA has a long open reading frame with the potential to encode a
protein of 1,057 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 115
kD. To further substantiate and identify the HUGL protein, Strand et al.
(1995) prepared polyclonal rabbit antibodies against synthetic peptides
corresponding to the N and C termini of the predicted translation
product of the HUGL gene. The affinity-purified anti-HUGL antibodies
recognized a single protein with an apparent molecular weight of
approximately 115 kD. Similar to the Drosophila protein, HUGL is part of
a cytoskeletal network and is associated with nonmuscle myosin II heavy
chain (type A, 160775; type B, 160776) and a kinase that specifically
phosphorylates HUGL at serine residues.

Koyama et al. (1996) isolated cDNA clones from a human brain cDNA
library for the human homolog of the murine Llglh gene that was
originally isolated as a homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor gene
'lethal(2) giant larvae' (l(2)gl). The full-length cDNA encodes 1,033
amino acids with 40% identity to the Drosophila l(2)gl amino acid
sequence and 86% identity to the murine homolog. Northern analysis of
mRNA revealed that this gene was expressed as a 4.4-kb transcript in a
wide range of tissues; however, more abundant expression occurred in
brain and testes.

GENE FUNCTION

Ohshiro et al. (2000) demonstrated in Drosophila that lethal giant
larvae (Lgl) is essential for asymmetric cortical localization of all
basal determinants in mitotic neuroblasts, and is therefore
indispensable for neural fate decisions. Lgl, which itself is uniformly
cortical, interacts with several types of myosin to localize the
determinants. Another tumor suppressor protein, lethal discs large (Dlg)
(DLG1; 601014), participates in this process by regulating the
localization of Lgl. The localization of the apical components is
unaffected in Lgl or Dlg mutants. Thus, Lgl and Dlg act in a common
process that differentially mediates cortical protein targeting in
mitotic neuroblasts, and creates intrinsic differences between daughter
cells.

Peng et al. (2000) showed that the tumor suppressor genes Lgl and Dlg
regulate basal protein targeting, but not apical complex formation or
spindle orientation, in both embryonic and larval Drosophila
neuroblasts. Dlg protein is apically enriched and is required for
maintaining cortical localization of Lgl protein. Basal protein
targeting requires microfilament and myosin function, yet the Lgl
phenotype is strongly suppressed by reducing levels of myosin II. Peng
et al. (2000) concluded that Dlg and Lgl promote, and myosin II
inhibits, actomyosin-dependent basal protein targeting in neuroblasts.

Zarnescu et al. (2005) found that mouse Lgl was expressed at low levels
in the cytoplasm along with Fmr1 (309550). Overexpression of
fluorescence-tagged Fmr1 directed the assembly of endogenous Lgl into
perinuclear and cytoplasmic granules. In a mouse catecholaminergic cell
line, Fmr1 overexpression resulted in reorganization of endogenous Lgl
into Fmr1-containing granules in the perinuclear region and within
developing neurites.

Dollar et al. (2005) demonstrated that a vertebrate homolog of Lgl
associates with dishevelled (601365), an essential mediator of Wnt
signaling, and that dishevelled regulates the localization of Lgl in
Xenopus ectoderm and Drosophila follicular epithelium. Dollar et al.
(2005) showed that both Lgl and dishevelled are required for normal
apical-basal polarity of Xenopus ectodermal cells. In addition, Dollar
et al. (2005) showed that the Wnt receptor frizzled 8 (606146), but not
frizzled 7 (603410), causes Lgl to dissociate from the cortex with the
concomitant loss of its activity in vivo. Dollar et al. (2005) concluded
that their findings suggest a molecular basis for the regulation of cell
polarity by frizzled and dishevelled.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of DNA from rodent/human somatic cell hybrids
and by fluorescence in situ hybridization, Strand et al. (1995)
determined that the HUGL locus spans at least 25 kb on chromosome
17p12-p11.2 centromeric to the p53 gene (191170).

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Koyama et al. (1996) localized
the human gene to 17p11.2. They reported that in patients with
Smith-Magenis syndrome (182290) with microdeletions of chromosome
17p11.2, hybridization occurred only on one chromosome 17, i.e., on the
normal chromosome.

Campbell et al. (1997) reported that the LLGL1 gene is adjacent to FLII
(600362), and that the 3-prime ends of the 2 transcripts overlap. The
overlap region contains poly(A) signals for both genes and is highly
conserved between human and mouse.

ANIMAL MODEL

Klezovitch et al. (2004) found that loss of Lgl1 in mice resulted in
formation of neuroepithelial rosette-like structures, similar to the
neuroblastic rosettes in human primitive neuroectodermal tumors. Newborn
Lgl1 -/- pups developed severe hydrocephalus and died neonatally. A
large proportion of Lgl1 -/- neural progenitor cells failed to exit the
cell cycle and differentiate, and instead continued to proliferate and
died by apoptosis. Dividing Lgl1 -/- cells were unable to asymmetrically
localize the Notch inhibitor Numb (603728), and the resulting failure of
asymmetric cell divisions may have been responsible for the
hyperproliferation and lack of differentiation.

Lee et al. (2006) tested whether cell polarity genes, known to regulate
embryonic neuroblast asymmetric cell division, also regulate neuroblast
self-renewal. Clonal analysis in Drosophila larval brains showed that
pins (see 609245) mutant neuroblasts rapidly fail to self-renew, whereas
lgl mutant neuroblasts generate multiple neuroblasts. Notably, lgl pins
double mutant neuroblasts all divide symmetrically to self-renew,
filling the brain with neuroblasts at the expense of neurons. The lgl
pins neuroblasts show ectopic cortical localization of atypical protein
kinase C (aPKC; see 176960), and a decrease in aPKC expression reduces
neuroblast numbers, suggesting that aPKC promotes neuroblast
self-renewal. In support of this hypothesis, Lee et al. (2006) found
that neuroblast-specific overexpression of membrane-targeted aPKC, but
not a kinase-dead version, induced ectopic neuroblast self-renewal. Lee
et al. (2006) concluded that cortical aPKC kinase activity is a potent
inducer of neuroblast self-renewal.

600767	TITLE *600767 GDP-DISSOCIATION INHIBITOR 2; GDI2
;;RAB GDP-DISSOCIATION INHIBITOR, BETA; RABGDIB;;
RAB GDI-BETA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GDI-beta (GDI2) is a member of the GDP-dissociation inhibitor family,
which includes GDI-alpha (GDI1; 300104). The rab GDIs modulate the
activity of G proteins of the rab family and play a role in the
regulation of vesicle-mediated cellular transport (summary by Sedlacek
et al., 1998).

CLONING

Shisheva et al. (1994) cloned mouse RABGDIB (which they referred to as
'smg p25A GDI') and reported the sequence. Sedlacek et al. (1994) found
that the human RABGDIB sequence is 86.5% similar to RABGDIA, which they
referred to as 'XAP-4.' Bachner et al. (1995) studied expression
patterns of the 2 human genes. They showed that the 2.5-kb mRNA for
RABGDIB is ubiquitously expressed, in contrast to RABGDIA, which is
expressed primarily in neural and sensory tissues.

Rak et al. (2003) used a combination of chemical synthesis and protein
engineering to generate and crystallize the monoprenylated YPT1-RABGDI
complex. The structure of this complex was determined to 1.5-angstrom
resolution and provided a structural basis for the ability of RABGDI to
inhibit nucleotide release by RAB proteins. Isoprenoid binding requires
a conformational change that opens a cavity in the hydrophobic core of
its domain II. Analysis of the structure provided a molecular basis for
understanding a RABGDI mutant that causes mental retardation.

GENE STRUCTURE

The GDI-beta gene contains 11 exons (Sedlacek et al., 1998).

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Sedlacek et al. (1998) demonstrated that the
GDI2 gene maps to 10p15; a processed pseudogene maps to 7p13-p11.
