G1P3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential screening of an alpha-interferon (IFNA; 147660)-induced
neuroblastoma cell cDNA library, followed by screening an IFNA-treated
Daudi lymphoblastoid cell cDNA library, Kelly et al. (1986) cloned IFI6,
which they called 6-16. The deduced 130-amino acid protein is
hydrophobic and contains an N-terminal signal peptide.

GENE FUNCTION

Kelly et al. (1986) showed that IFI6 was induced in HeLa cells by IFNA
and IFNB (147640). Following transfection in mouse cells, human IFI6 was
expressed in response to mouse Ifna and Ifnb, but not Ifng (147570),
with the same kinetics and dose response as in human cells.

Itzhaki and Porter (1991) reported a method for targeted disruption of
the IFI6 gene and detection by secretion of human growth hormone (GH1;
139250).

Cheriyath et al. (2007) showed that treatment of human myeloma cells
with IFN-alpha-2b (see IFNA2; 147562) for 24 hours antagonized TRAIL
(TNFSF10; 603598)-mediated apoptosis, but after 72 hours it augmented
TRAIL apoptotic activity. The antiapoptotic activity of IFN-alpha-2b was
associated with increased expression of G1P3. Ectopically expressed G1P3
localized to mitochondria and antagonized TRAIL-mediated mitochondrial
potential loss, cytochrome c release, and apoptosis. Conversely, RNA
interference-mediated downregulation of G1P3 restored
IFN-alpha-2b-induced apoptosis. Cheriyath et al. (2007) concluded that
curtailing G1P3-mediated antiapoptotic signals may improve therapies for
myeloma and other malignancies.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kelly et al. (1986) determined that the IFI6 gene contains 5 exons and
has a TATA box upstream of the transcription initiation site.

Porter et al. (1988) described the interferon response element of the
human IFI6 gene.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Clauss et al. (1990) mapped the IFI6
gene to chromosome 1.

Itzhaki et al. (1992) reported that the IFI6 gene maps to chromosome
1p35, based on the work of others using fluorescence in situ
hybridization. Itzhaki et al. (1992) used telomere-associated chromosome
fragmentation (TACF), a novel approach for chromosome mapping based on
the nontargeted introduction of clone telomeres into mammalian
chromosomes, to target telomeric DNA to the IFI6 gene on chromosome 1p.
They deduced that the IFI6 gene is oriented away from the centromere by
targeting telomeric DNA to the specific locus by homologous
recombination, using a selection strategy that imposed the requirement
that the telomeric DNA be oriented in the same direction as the IFI6
gene.

601989	TITLE *601989 S100 CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN A13; S100A13
DESCRIPTION Wicki et al. (1996) reported the characterization of a human gene they
symbolized S100A13, a calcium-binding protein belonging to the S100
protein family. S100 proteins are small EF-hand calcium-binding proteins
of variable lengths and sequence identities. At least 12 of 15 members
of the family are clustered on chromosome 1q21 (see S100A1; 176940);
S100A13 likewise colocalizes with S100A1 on the 1q21 cluster. The
predicted 98 amino acid S100A13 protein shows sequence homologies to
other S100 proteins between 50.5% (S100A5; 176991) and 59.3% (S100A12;
603112). Northern blot analysis showed high amounts of S100A13 mRNA in
adult skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, ovary, spleen, small intestine,
and pancreas and in fetal lung, heart, cochlea, liver, spleen, and
parathyroid tumor cells. Moderate levels were detected in all other
tissues examined, with the exception of placenta and leukocytes, which
had very low or undetectable levels. Wicki et al. (1996) also cloned the
mouse S100A13 gene. Mouse S100A13 is composed of 98 amino acids and
displays 86.7% homology compared to human S100A13.
