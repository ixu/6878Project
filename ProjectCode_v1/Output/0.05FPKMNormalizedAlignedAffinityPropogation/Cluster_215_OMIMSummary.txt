;;EOSINOPHIL DIFFERENTIATION FACTOR; EDF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Campbell et al. (1987) cloned eosinophil differentiation factor (EDF)
from a genomic library in lambda phage by using a murine EDF cDNA clone
as a probe. The predicted amino acid sequence of 134 amino acids was
identical to that reported for human interleukin-5 but showed no
significant homology with other known hematopoietic growth regulators.
Interleukin-5 is a selective eosinophil-activating growth hormone. The
amino acid sequence was about 70% identical to that of murine EDF.
Recombinant human EDF, expressed from the human EDF gene after
transfection into monkey COS cells, stimulated the production of
eosinophils and eosinophil colonies from normal human bone marrow but
had no effect on the production of neutrophils or mononuclear cells
(monocytes and lymphoid cells).

Tanabe et al. (1987) cloned the IL5 gene and determined its structure.

Yokota et al. (1987) concluded that a single cDNA clone encodes a
protein that acts as a growth and differentiation factor for both B
cells and eosinophils.

GENE STRUCTURE

Campbell et al. (1987) found that the human IL5 gene contains 3 introns.

MAPPING

Takahashi et al. (1989) mapped the IL5 gene to 5q23.3-q31.1 by in situ
hybridization. Sutherland et al. (1988) assigned the gene to 5q31 by in
situ hybridization and showed that the gene is deleted in the 5q-
syndrome. At least 3 other genes involved in hematopoiesis are located
in the same region: IL3 (147740), GMCSF (138960), and FMS (164770).
Chandrasekharappa et al. (1990) demonstrated that IL4 and IL5 are
closely linked physically, with a maximum separation of 310 kb. There
appeared to be an HTF island between them. IL3 and CSF2 (138960), which
are located in the same general area of 5q, could not physically be
linked to IL4 or IL5. Willman et al. (1993), who mapped IRF1 (147575) to
5q31.1, concluded that the order of genes is:
cen--IL4--IL5--IRF1--CDC25C--IL3/CSF2--tel. Kozak (1988) assigned the
homologous mouse locus to chromosome 11 by in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Coffman et al. (1989) showed that a monoclonal antibody to IL5
completely suppressed the blood eosinophilia in mice parasitized by a
nematode but had no effect on serum IgE increase in response to the
infestation. In contrast, an antibody to interleukin-4 (147780)
inhibited parasite-induced IgE but not the eosinophilia.

In a patient with the hypereosinophilia syndrome (see 131400), Cogan et
al. (1994) demonstrated clonal proliferation of type-2 helper T cells
and showed that production of large amounts of IL5 was responsible for
eosinophilia, and interleukin-4 for excessive production of IgE.

Studying 30 asthmatic and 30 nonasthmatic subjects, Pereira et al.
(1998) found no changes from the normal sequence in all 4 exons of IL5,
as well as the promoter and 3-prime untranslated regions, by SSCP and
heteroduplex analysis. They concluded that mutations in the IL5 gene are
not likely to be a common cause of inherited predisposition to asthma.

Simon et al. (1999) found that clonal populations of abnormal T cells
producing interleukin-5 occur in some patients with idiopathic
eosinophilia. Among 60 patients with idiopathic eosinophilia, 16 had
circulating T cells with an aberrant immunophenotype. In each of these
patients, the abnormal immunophenotype was unique. Evidence of clonal
rearrangements of the T-cell receptor was obtained in 8 of the 16
patients. The aberrant T cells produced large amounts of interleukin-5
in vitro. At the time of the initial blood analysis, 15 of the 16
patients had no evidence of a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder.

Broide et al. (1999) reviewed the genes that regulate eosinophilic
inflammation, including IL5.

Long-range regulatory elements are difficult to discover experimentally;
however, they tend to be conserved among mammals, suggesting that
cross-species sequence comparisons should identify them. To search for
regulatory sequences, Loots et al. (2000) examined about 1 megabase of
orthologous human and mouse sequences for conserved noncoding elements
with greater than or equal to 70% identity over at least 100 basepairs.
Ninety noncoding sequences meeting these criteria were discovered, and
the analysis of 15 of these elements found that about 70% were conserved
across mammals. Characterization of the largest element in transgenic
mice propagating human 5q31 yeast artificial chromosomes revealed it to
be a coordinate regulator of 3 genes, interleukin-4, interleukin-13
(147683), and interleukin-5. This conserved noncoding sequence, called
CNS1 by Loots et al. (2000), is 401 bp in length and is located in the
intergenic region, approximately 13 kb, between IL4 and IL13. CNS1
demonstrates a high degree of conservation across mammals (80% identity
in mice, humans, cows, dogs, and rabbits), which contrasts sharply with
the relatively low conservation observed in the coding regions of the
flanking genes, IL4 and IL13, which have only 50% identity between
humans and mice. This element is single copy in the human genome and has
been conserved during evolution, not only with regards to sequence but
also to genomic location, having been mapped in dogs, baboons, humans,
and mice to the IL4-IL13 intergenic region. Experiments in transgenic
mice revealed that CNS1 acts through its effect on the transcriptional
activity of IL4, IL13, and IL5. Expression of other genes in the YAC had
no change relative to wildtype in activated Th2 cells or other tissues
tested.

By analysis of human YAC transgenic mice containing the 5q31 cytokine
genes, Lacy et al. (2000) determined that the human proteins are
produced under Th2 conditions in vitro and in response to
Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, a Th2-inducing stimulus, in vivo. The
authors observed no adverse effects on murine lymphoid organs. Fewer
cells produced the endogenous mouse cytokines in transgenic than in
control mice, suggesting competition for stable expression between the
mouse and human genes. The data also suggested that regulatory elements
within the human transgene are capable of interacting with trans-acting
murine factors.

Normal intestinal mucosa contains abundant immunoglobulin A
(IgA)-secreting cells, which are generated from B cells in
gut-associated lymphoid tissues. Mora et al. (2006) showed that
dendritic cells (DCs) from gut-associated lymphoid tissues induce T
cell-independent expression of IgA and gut-homing receptors on B cells.
Gut-associated lymphoid tissue DC-derived retinoic acid alone conferred
gut tropism but could not promote IgA secretion. However, retinoic acid
potently synergized with the gut-associated lymphoid tissue DC-derived
IL6 (147620) or IL5 to induce IgA secretion. Mora et al. (2006) found
that consequently, mice deficient in the retinoic acid precursor vitamin
A lacked IgA-secreting cells in the small intestine. Mora et al. (2006)
found that gut-associated lymphoid tissue DCs shape mucosal immunity by
modulating B cell migration and effector activity through
synergistically acting mediators.

Endo et al. (2011) examined expression of cell surface markers to
identify functionally distinct subpopulations of mouse Th2 cells. FACS
analysis demonstrated 4 Th2 subpopulations based on high or low
expression levels of Cd62l (SELL; 153240) and Cxcr3 (300574). All 4
subpopulations produced comparable levels of Il4 and Il13, but Th2 cells
expressing low levels of both Cd62l and Cxcr3 (Cd62l-lo/Cxcr3-lo cells)
selectively produced Il5. Il5 production in Cd62l-lo/Cxcr3-lo cells was
accompanied by histone H3-K4 methylation, a marker for the permissive
conformation of chromatin, at the IL5 promoter. DNA microarray analysis
and quantitative RT-PCR showed that Cd44 (107269)-positive memory Th2
cells expressing Il5 had lower levels of Eomes (604615) and Tbx21
(604895) and higher levels of Rora (600825) and Pparg (601487) than
memory Th2 cells lacking Il5 expression. RNA silencing demonstrated that
Eomes downregulation was required for Il5 expression and that Eomes had
no effect on H3-K4 methylation at the Il5 promoter. Instead Eomes
suppressed Gata3 (131320) transcriptional activity by inhibiting Gata3
binding to the Il5 promoter. Depletion of Cd62l-lo/Cxcr3-lo cells
ameliorated memory Th2 cell-dependent airway inflammation in mice. Endo
et al. (2011) concluded that IL5 production preferentially occurs in the
CD62L-lo/CXCR3-lo subpopulation regulated by EOMES expression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Rodrigues et al. (1996) noted that, as the main regulator of
eosinopoiesis, eosinophil maturation and activation, and IgA production,
IL5 contributes in several ways to human immune defenses against various
pathogens, including helminths and infectious agents of the digestive
and respiratory tracts. On the other hand, the increase in number of
eosinophils and the activation of these cells, both of which are related
to elevated IL5 production, are the cause of severe pathologic
disorders, as in asthma or hypereosinophilic syndromes. To investigate
the role of genetic factors in the large variability observed in IL5
production among subjects exposed to comparable antigenic stimulation,
Rodrigues et al. (1996) conducted a segregation analysis in a Brazilian
population infected by the helminth parasite Schistosoma mansoni. The
analysis was performed on IL5 levels produced by blood mononuclear cells
of these subjects after in vitro restimulation with either parasite
extracts (designated IL5/SS for schistosomula sonicates) or the
T-lymphocyte mitogen phytohemagglutinin (designated the IL5/PHA
phenotype). The results provided evidence to Rodrigues et al. (1996) for
the segregation of a codominant major gene controlling IL5/SS and
IL5/PHA production and accounting for 70% and 73% of the phenotypic
variance, respectively; the frequency of the allele predisposing to low
IL5 production was approximately 0.22 for both phenotypes. They found no
significant relationship between these genes and the gene controlling
infection intensities by S. mansoni detected in a previous study. The
authors could not ascertain whether the IL5/SS and IL5/PHA phenotypes
were determined by a single gene locus.

The SM1 locus (181460) on chromosome 5q31-q33 is associated with
intensity of infection with the African Schistosoma (blood fluke)
species, S. mansoni. Ellis et al. (2007) genotyped 30 HapMap tagging
SNPs in a nested case control study across 3 genes in the 5q31-q33
region, IL4, IL5, and IL13, in 159 individuals putatively susceptible to
reinfection with the Asian Schistosoma species, S. japonicum, 133
putatively resistant individuals, and 113 individuals with symptomatic
infection. They identified 2 strongly linked SNPs in the 3-prime UTR of
IL5, dbSNP rs4143832 and dbSNP rs17690122, that were associated with
susceptibility to symptomatic infection. Ellis et al. (2007) concluded
that variants in the 3-prime UTR of IL5 may modulate the immune response
in individuals with symptomatic infection.
