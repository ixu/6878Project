DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SEMA7A is an 80-kD membrane-bound semaphorin that associates with cell
surfaces via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage. It is
preferentially expressed on activated lymphocytes and erythrocytes.
SEMA7A carries the John Milton Hagen (JMH) blood group antigens (see
614745) (summary by Yamada et al., 1999).

CLONING

By PCR using primers designed from alcelaphine herpesvirus-1 (AHV) sema,
followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Lange et al. (1998) cloned
full-length SEMA7A, which they designated SEMAL, from a placenta cDNA
library. The deduced 666-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 75 kD, and the unglycosylated protein has a calculated
molecular mass of about 70 kD following signal peptide cleavage. SEMA7A
contains a 44-amino acid N-terminal signal sequence, a semaphorin domain
of about 500 amino acids, an immunoglobulin-like motif, and a C-terminal
hydrophobic domain that lacks a significant intracellular tail. The
semaphorin domain has several conserved cysteine residues and an RGD
motif. SEMA7A also contains 5 N-glycosylation sites and several
myristoylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.2-kb
transcript expressed predominantly in spleen, thymus, testis, and ovary.
Little or no expression was detected in prostate, small intestine,
colon, and peripheral blood leukocytes. RNA dot blot analysis detected
expression in placenta, spleen, and gonadal tissue, but not in neuronal
or muscular tissue.

By searching an EST database using AHV sema as probe, Xu et al. (1998)
identified SEMA7A, which they designated SEMAK1. SEMA7A shares about 50%
amino acid identity with AHV sema and less than 30% identity with other
semaphorins. Northern blot analysis of adult mouse tissues detected a
4.4-kb Sema7a transcript expressed at high levels in brain, spinal cord,
lung, and testis. In situ hybridization detected weak but dynamic
expression of Sema7a in spinal cord, cerebellum, and cortex during
embryonic development. In adult mice, Sema7a was expressed in several
brain structures and cell layers.

By PCR using primers based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of
SEMA7A, followed by screening a leukemic T-cell line cDNA library and a
placenta cDNA library, Yamada et al. (1999) cloned SEMA7A, which they
called CDW108. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.5-kb transcript
expressed at highest levels in placenta, testis, and spleen, with low
levels in brain and thymus. Yamada et al. (1999) detected 5
differentially glycosylated forms of SEMA7A by SDS-PAGE of a transfected
esophageal cancer cell line. The largest protein had an apparent
molecular mass of about 80 kD. Treatment with peptide-N-glycosidase
revealed a deglycosylated protein with an apparent molecular mass of
about 65 kD.

Sato and Takahashi (1998) cloned mouse Sema7a. They noted that the
immunoglobulin-like domain of the deduced 664-amino acid protein is of
the C2 type. Human and mouse SEMA7A share 89.5% identity. Northern blot
analysis of rat tissues detected highest expression in the nervous
system, and expression in the cerebellum and brain stem increased during
development. Moderate expression was detected in thymus and spleen.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lange et al. (1998) determined that the SEMA7A gene contains at least 13
exons and spans about 9 kb.

Seltsam et al. (2007) stated that the SEMA7A gene contains 14 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Lange et al. (1998) mapped the SEMA7A gene to chromosome
15q22.2-q23. Using radiation hybrid analysis, Yamada et al. (1999)
mapped the SEMA7A gene to chromosome 15q23-q24.

Lange et al. (1998) mapped the mouse Sema7a gene to chromosome 9A3.3-B.

GENE FUNCTION

Xu et al. (1998) demonstrated that SEMA7A is a GPI-anchored membrane
protein. SEMA7A was expressed on the cell surface of transfected COS-7
cells, and treatment with phospholipase C (see 600220) released the
protein from the cell surface. A soluble mutant of SEMA7A bound to
macrophage and mast cell lines, but it did not bind to COS-7 cells
expressing neuropilin-1 (602069) or neuropilin-2 (602070), receptors for
several secreted semaphorins. Xu et al. (1998) concluded that these
macrophage and mast cell lines contain a specific receptor for SEMA7A.

Pasterkamp et al. (2003) showed that semaphorin 7A, a membrane-anchored
member of the semaphorin family of guidance proteins known for its
immunomodulatory effects, can also mediate neuronal functions.
Pasterkamp et al. (2003) showed that unlike many other semaphorins,
which act as repulsive guidance cues, SEMA7A enhances central and
peripheral axon growth and is required for proper axon tract formation
during embryonic development. Unexpectedly, SEMA7A enhancement of axon
outgrowth requires integrin receptors and activation of MAPK signaling
pathways. Pasterkamp et al. (2003) concluded that their findings defined
a theretofore unknown biologic function for semaphorins, identified an
unexpected role for integrins and integrin-dependent intracellular
signaling in mediating semaphorin responses, and provided a framework
for understanding and interfering with SEMA7A function in both immune
and nervous systems. Pasterkamp et al. (2003) showed that
SEMA7A-mediated axon growth is plexin C1 (604259)-independent.

Suzuki et al. (2007) demonstrated that SEMA7A, which is expressed on
activated T cells, stimulates cytokine production in monocytes and
macrophages through alpha-1-beta-1 integrin (192968, 135630) (also known
as very late antigen-1) as a component of the immunologic synapse, and
is critical for the effector phase of the inflammatory immune response.
Sema7A-null mice are defective in cell-mediated immune responses such as
contact hypersensitivity and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
Although antigen-specific and cytokine-producing effector T cells could
develop and migrate into antigen-challenged sites in Sema7a-null mice,
Sema7a-null T cells failed to induce contact hypersensitivity even when
directly injected into the antigen-challenged sites. Thus, Suzuki et al.
(2007) concluded that the interaction between SEMA7A and alpha-1-beta-1
integrin is crucial at the site of inflammation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Association with Bone Mineral Density

Koh et al. (2006) genotyped 5 polymorphisms of the SEMA7A gene in 560
postmenopausal Korean women and measured bone mineral density (BMD; see
601884) of the lumbar spine and proximal femur. The SEMA7A polymorphisms
15775C-G (dbSNP rs2072649) and 22331A-G (dbSNP rs741761) were associated
with a low BMD of the femoral neck and lumbar spine (p = 0.02 and 0.04,
respectively) in a recessive model. A haplotype based on the 5 SNPs,
so-called ht4, was associated with risk of vertebral fracture (OR = 1.87
and 1.93, p = 0.03 and 0.02, in dominant and codominant models,
respectively). Koh et al. (2006) suggested that variations in SEMA7A may
play a role in decreased BMD and risk of vertebral fracture.

- John Milton Hagen Blood Group System: JMH-Variant Phenotype

In 5 unrelated individuals with JMH-variant phenotype (see 614745) from
5 different countries, Seltsam et al. (2007) identified 4 missense
mutations in the SEMA7A gene (607961.0001-607961.0004). These mutations
were not detected in genomic DNA from 100 randomly selected individuals
from Northern Germany. All 4 missense mutations occurred in the
semaphorin domain of SEMA7A.

ANIMAL MODEL

Czopik et al. (2006) found that T cells from immunized Sema7a -/- mice
had increased proliferative responses to antigen that were not
attributable to Sema7a deficiency on macrophages or dendritic cells.
Sema7a -/- mice were prone to die at the onset of experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and had higher clinical EAE scores
compared with wildtype littermates. Delayed-type hypersensitivity
responses were also enhanced in Sema7a -/- mice. Czopik et al. (2006)
concluded that SEMA7A plays an important T cell-intrinsic inhibitory
role and is essential in limiting T cell-mediated autoimmunity.

semaphorin domain. At least 2 of the women were JHM-positive and their
alloantibody was compatible with most JHM-negative red blood cells
tested; the other 2 women were not tested. Soluble forms of wildtype and
R347L variant SEMA7A proteins were produced in vitro and demonstrated a
specific alloantibody reaction with wildtype recombinant SEMA7A, but not
with the R347L variant form.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Bunnell et al. (1990) identified a human cell division control
(CDC)-related protein kinase, p58, that is structurally and functionally
related to p34(cdc2) (CDC2; 116940). Abnormal expression of the p58
protein kinase in eukaryotic cells had effects suggesting that it is a
negative regulator of normal cell cycle progression. The gene is well
conserved evolutionarily. Its expression is regulated during murine
embryogenesis, and its activity is coordinately regulated with that of
p34(cdc2) during the cell cycle.

Lahti et al. (1994) characterized the genomic region surrounding CDC2L1
and found that a related gene, CDC2L2 (116951), was located within 100
kb. They referred to CDC2L1 as PITSLRE B, based on the amino acid
sequence of the region corresponding to the conserved CDC2 PSTAIRE box.

Xiang et al. (1994) isolated multiple, alternatively spliced CDC2L1 and
CDC2L2 mRNAs. The CDC2L1 transcripts encode protein isoforms ranging in
size from 58 to 110 kD. The isoforms vary in the length and sequence of
their N-terminal regions; the protein kinase catalytic and C-terminal
domains are identical. All contain a 30-residue acid blob domain
comprised primarily of glutamic acid. The larger protein species
contained a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal. Western blot
analysis revealed that the 58-kD isoform was present only in cells
undergoing apoptosis. Xiang et al. (1994) analyzed the expression
pattern of the CDC2L1 mRNAs.

The CDC2L1 and CDC2L2 genes encode almost identical protein kinases of
110 kD that contain at their C termini the open reading frame of a
smaller isoform of 58 kD. Cornelis et al. (2000) found that 2 PITSLRE
protein kinase isoforms, p110 and p58, are translated from a single
transcript by initiation at alternative in-frame AUG codons. p110 is
produced by classic cap-dependent translation, whereas p58 results from
internal initiation of translation controlled by an internal ribosome
entry site (IRES) with unique properties. The IRES element is localized
to the mRNA coding region, and its activity is cell cycle regulated,
permitting translation of p58 in G2/M.

Loyer et al. (2008) stated that both CDC2L2 and CDC2L1 can produce a
third isoform, p46, by caspase-dependent proteolysis of either the p110
or p58 isoforms. By immunofluorescence analysis of several human cell
lines, they detected p110 in both nucleoplasm and nuclear speckles.
Western blot analysis showed robust expression of p110 in several human
cell lines and in activated human peripheral blood cells. Only activated
blood cells expressed p58 and p46. Size exclusion chromatography of HeLa
cells revealed that p110 fractionated with protein complexes of about
170 kD to over 1 MDa.

GENE FUNCTION

Lahti et al. (1994) demonstrated that 1 allele of the entire gene CDC2L
complex was either deleted or translocated in 18 of 20 neuroblastoma
(256700) cell lines investigated. They suggested that the CDC2L gene
complex may harbor 1 or more tumor suppressor genes affected by
chromosome 1p36 modifications in neuroblastoma.

By immunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down assays with human
cell lines, Loyer et al. (2008) found that p110 CDK11 associated with
the alpha and beta isoforms of cyclin L1 (CCNL1; 613384) and L2 (CCNL2;
613482) in a high molecular mass complex that showed splicing activity.
The p58 and p46 CDK11 isoforms interacted more weakly with the cyclin L
alpha isoforms. In vivo splicing assays showed that expression of cyclin
L1-alpha, L1-beta, L2-alpha, or L2-beta and/or p110 CDK11 increased
intron-splicing activity and altered alternative splice-site selection
in a cyclin L1 and L2 isoform- and cell type-specific manner. In
contrast with p110 CDK11, p58 and p46 CDK11 reduced splicing activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Eipers et al. (1992) detailed the complete structure of the CDC2L1 gene
including its putative promoter region, transcriptional start sites,
exonic sequences, and intron/exon boundary sequences. The gene is 10 kb
and contains 12 exons and 11 introns.

Gururajan et al. (1998) determined the structure of the 140-kb CDC2L
genomic region. This region consists of 2 identical genomic segments
arranged in a tail-to-tail configuration. Each segment contains a CDC2L
gene linked to an MMP gene. See MMP21 (603320). In each case, the most
widely expressed products of the CDC2L gene are derived from a genomic
region that is composed of 20 exons and spans approximately 20 kb. The
authors reported that only 15 amino acids of the 773-786 residues that
encode the multiple CDC2L isoforms are unique to either CDC2L1 or
CDC2L2.

MAPPING

Eipers et al. (1991) assigned the expressed p58 gene to 1p36 by somatic
cell hybrid analysis, in situ hybridization, and nested PCR
amplification of microdissected chromosomes. The authors stated that
this gene, tentatively symbolized PK58, may be implicated in the
pathogenesis of tumors that have deletion in the region of 1p36.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Lahti et al. (1994) mapped the
CDC2L1 gene to 1p36.3.

White et al. (1995) showed that CDC2L1 is located outside the consensus
region of allelic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) associated with
neuroblastomas, namely, 1p36.3-p36.2, and is therefore not the
neuroblastoma suppressor gene.

608648	TITLE *608648 SEC63, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; SEC63
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SEC63 works in concert with the SEC61 translocon (see 609213) and BIP
(HSPA5; 138120) to facilitate cotranslational translocation across the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane of nascent peptides destined to
become either secreted or membrane-inserted proteins (Fedeles et al.,
2011).

CLONING

In yeast, Sec63 associates with the trimeric Sec61 complex and Sec62
(602173) in an ER membrane complex involved in posttranslational
transport of newly synthesized proteins. By searching an EST database
for sequences similar to yeast Sec63, Skowronek et al. (1999) identified
human SEC63. The deduced 760-amino acid protein contains 3 putative
transmembrane domains, with a DnaJ-like domain between transmembrane
segments 2 and 3. Yeast and human SEC63 share 25.6% amino acid identity.
Western blot analysis detected SEC63 at an apparent molecular mass of 83
kD in HeLa cell extracts and dog pancreatic microsomes. Subcellular
fractionation indicated the SEC63 is an integral ER membrane protein.
Protease protection experiments indicated that both the N and C termini
of canine Sec63 are oriented toward the cytosol, with the DnaJ domain
contained within the ER lumen, suggesting that the first hydrophobic
stretch does not traverse the ER membrane.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to bovine Sec63,
followed by PCR of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Meyer et al. (2000) cloned
SEC63. Western blot analysis detected Sec63 in all bovine and rat
tissues examined. Immunofluorescence analysis of human hepatoma cells
indicated that SEC63 and SEC62 colocalized with ER proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

By Western blot analysis and coimmunoprecipitation of proteins from
bovine rough microsomes, Meyer et al. (2000) found that mammalian Sec63
interacts with Sec62 and the Sec61 protein complex.

Using mutation analysis with protein pull-down assays, Muller et al.
(2010) found that the isolated N-terminal domain of human SEC62
interacted directly with the 26 C-terminal amino acids of SEC63 in a 1:1
ratio.

MAPPING

By FISH, Woollatt et al. (1999) mapped the SEC63 gene to chromosome
6q21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Polycystic liver disease often occurs in association with autosomal
dominant polycystic kidney disease (173900; 613905), but it also exists
as isolated autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (174050).
Mutations in the PRKCSH gene (177060) have been identified in cases of
autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD); of 66 unrelated
individuals with ADPLD, mutations in PRKCSH were excluded in 57 probands
by direct sequencing. Of these, 10 individuals belonged to families with
multiple affected individuals. Davila et al. (2004) carried out a
genomewide analysis for linkage in all 10 families. The disorder was
mapped to a genetic interval between D6S1021 and D6S474. Among the genes
located in this region on 6q21, they focused on those that are expressed
in liver tissue (as shown by RT-PCR) and that may be functionally linked
to PRKCSH through a role in protein maturation in the ER. SEC63 met
these criteria. They found several mutations, including W58X
(608648.0001), which occurred in 2 probands from the central U.S. who
were not known to be related. Three probands from Finland had different
mutations (608648.0002, 608648.0003, and 608648.0004). Although cysts
occurred only in the liver, SEC63 was expressed in all tissues tested.
The final count indicated mutations in SEC63 in 8 of 66 probands
(approximately 12%) in their sample that included both familial cases in
individual probands not known to have a positive family history.
Mutations in PRKCSH and SEC63 together account for less than one-third
of ADPLD cases, indicating that there is at least 1 more locus
associated with this disease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Fedeles et al. (2011) found that homozygous deletion of either Prkcsh or
Sec63 in mice led to early embryonic lethality. Kidney- or
liver-specific inactivation of either gene resulted in polycystic kidney
or liver disease, respectively. Knockout of both genes increased the
severity of cyst formation. Using a combination of targeted knockout and
overexpression with these 2 genes and 3 other major genes mutated in
polycystic kidney disease, Pkd1 (601313), Pkd2 (173910), and Pkhd1
(606702), Fedeles et al. (2011) produced a spectrum of cystic disease
severity. Cyst formation in all combinations of these genes, except
complete loss of Pkd2, was significantly modulated by altering
expression of Pkd1. Proteasome inhibition increased the steady-state
levels of Pkd1 in cells lacking Prkcsh and reduced cystic disease in
mouse models of autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease. Fedeles et
al. (2011) concluded that PRKCSH, SEC63, PKD1, PKD2, and PKHD1 form an
interaction network with PKD1 as the rate-limiting component.

;;cAMP-DEPENDENT TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 1
ATF1/EWS FUSION GENE, INCLUDED;;
ATF1/FUS FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

cAMP-dependent transcription factor-1 (ATF1) was described by Hai et al.
(1989) and Yoshimura et al. (1990).

MAPPING

Zucman et al. (1993) showed by fluorescence in situ hybridization that
the ATF1 gene maps to 12q13.

CYTOGENETICS

Malignant melanoma of soft parts (MMSP), or soft tissue clear cell
sarcoma, exhibits a recurrent chromosome translocation involving
chromosome 22, specifically t(12;22)(q13;q12). MMSP is a rare and
aggressive tumor that mainly develops in tendons and aponeuroses of
patients between 15 and 35 years of age, and which may also be derived
from neuroectoderm (Chung and Enzinger, 1983; Epstein et al., 1984).
Zucman et al. (1993) demonstrated that the hybrid transcripts in the
t(12;22) cases encoded a chimeric protein consisting of the N-terminal
domain of EWS (133450) linked to the bZIP domain of ATF1. Bicolor FISH
on interphase nuclei from an MMSP cell line showed that the EWS locus
was split and that the proximal part of EWS was juxtaposed to the ATF1
locus.

Waters et al. (2000) found that the 5-prime part of the FUS gene
(137070) was fused to the 3-prime part of the ATF1 gene in an
angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (612160) removed from the arm of a
5.5-year-old girl.

In tumor tissue derived from a patient with angiomatoid fibrous
histiocytoma, Hallor et al. (2005) identified a t(12;22)(q13;q12)
translocation. RT-PCR analysis detected an EWS/ATF1 fusion gene between
exons 7 and 5, respectively, that functioned as a constitutive
transcriptional activator.

In a tumor tissue sample from 1 of 9 patients with angiomatoid fibrous
histiocytoma, Antonescu et al. (2007) identified an EWS/ATF1 fusion
gene, linking exon 7 of EWS to exon 5 of ATF1.

613534	TITLE *613534 FANCD2/FANCI-ASSOCIATED NUCLEASE 1; FAN1
;;MYOTUBULARIN-RELATED PROTEIN 15; MTMR15;;
KIAA1018
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FAN1 is a DNA endo- and exonuclease involved in the repair of DNA damage
caused by crosslinking agents. FAN1 is recruited to sites of interstrand
cross linkage damage by interacting with the FANCI (611360)-FANCD2
(227646) complex (MacKay et al., 2010; Kratz et al., 2010; Smogorzewska
et al., 2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned FAN1, which they designated
KIAA1018. The deduced protein contains 1,017 amino acids. RT-PCR
analysis detected relatively uniform FAN1 expression in all adult and
fetal tissues and specific adult brain regions examined.

Kratz et al. (2010) stated that the FAN1 protein contains a predicted
N-terminal RAD18 (605256)-like ubiquitin (191339)-binding zinc finger
domain and a C-terminal nuclease domain.

Zhou et al. (2012) found expression of the FAN1 gene in multiple
parenchymatous human tissues, including the kidney, liver, neuronal
tissue, and female reproductive organs. The expression pattern differed
from that of FANCD2, which was found primarily in lymphatic and bone
marrow-derived sources, as well as in skin and testes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using tandem affinity purification and large-scale immunoprecipitation
analysis, followed by mass spectroscopy, Cannavo et al. (2007)
identified FAN1 as a protein that interacted with the mismatch repair
proteins MLH1 (120436), PMS1 (600258), and PMS2 (600259).

Independently, MacKay et al. (2010) and Kratz et al. (2010) found that
recombinant human FAN1 exhibited DNA endonuclease activity toward
5-prime flaps and had 5-prime exonuclease activity mediated by its
C-terminal nuclease domain. Only DNA damage caused by interstrand
crosslinking agents resulted in recruitment of FAN1 to sites of DNA
damage, and this recruitment required interaction of FAN1 with
monoubiquitinated FANCD2. Depletion of FAN1 sensitized human cell lines
to interstrand crosslinking agents and caused chromosomal instability.
Smogorzewska et al. (2010) reported similar findings and showed that
FAN1 required both FANCI and FANCD2 for localization at sites of DNA
damage.

A central event in the Fanconi pathway is monoubiquitylation of the
FANCI-FANCD2 protein complex. Liu et al. (2010) characterized FAN1,
which promotes interstrand crosslink repair in a manner strictly
dependent on its ability to accumulate at or near sites of DNA damage
and that relies on monoubiquitylation of the FANCI-FANCD2 complex. Liu
et al. (2010) concluded that the monoubiquitylated complex recruits the
downstream repair protein FAN1 and facilitates repair of DNA interstrand
crosslinks.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the FAN1
gene to chromosome 15.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 9 unrelated families with karyomegalic
interstitial nephritis (KMIN; 614817), Zhou et al. (2012) identified 12
different homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the FAN1 gene
(see, e.g., 613534.0001-613534.0008). Eight of the 12 mutations resulted
in a truncated protein. The first mutation was identified by
homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing in 1 affected family. Upon
exposure to mitomycin C, FAN1 mutant cells showed genomic instability,
as manifest by increased chromatid breaks and radial chromosomes on
metaphase spreads. Although the results of the test for Fanconi anemia
(see, e.g., 227650), diepoxybutane-induced breakage, were negative in
FAN1-mutant cells lines, these cells still showed decreased survival in
response to either inducer of interstrand crosslink repair (ICL)
compared to controls. Thus, there were subtle differences in cell
reaction between FANCA (607139)-mutant and FAN1-mutant cells, suggesting
that these proteins act in somewhat distinct manners. None of the FAN1
mutant proteins was able to correct mitomycin C-induced decreased
survival in cells lacking FAN1 nuclease activity. Morpholino knockdown
of Fan1 in zebrafish embryos resulted in a nephronophthisis (NPHP;
256100)-like phenotype, with shortened and curved body axis, as well as
a Fanconi anemia-like phenotype, with microcephaly, microphthalmia, and
massive apoptosis. There was evidence of activation of the DNA damage
repair pathway, as demonstrated by increased signaling for gamma-H2AX
(H2AFX; 601772). Knockdown of born Fan1 and p53 (191170) in zebrafish
caused renal cysts, reminiscent of a ciliopathy. In the fawn-hooded
hypertensive rat, an animal model of chronic kidney disease, as well as
in kidney samples from humans with genetically heterogeneous forms of
chronic kidney disease, Zhou et al. (2012) found increased nuclear
staining for gamma-H2AX, indicating activation of the DNA damage
response pathway. These findings supported the hypothesis that DNA
lesions and DNA damage response pathways may partially drive renal
damage in NPHP-related ciliopathies and in chronic kidney disease.

heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the FAN1 gene. Both families carried a
T-to-A transition in intron 2 (1234+2T-A), resulting in a splice site
mutation on 1 allele. One family (Godin et al., 1996) carried a 2-bp
deletion in exon 7 (2036_7delGA; 613534.0003) on the second allele, and
the other family carried a 2245C-T transition in exon 9, resulting in an
arg749-to-ter (R749X; 613534.0004) substitution on the second allele.
None of the mutations were found in 96 controls, and haplotype analysis
suggested a founder effect for the splice site mutation.

611616	TITLE *611616 NAD KINASE; NADK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NADK catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to NAD to
generate NADP, which in its reduced form acts as an electron donor for
biosynthetic reactions (Lerner et al., 2001).

CLONING

By EST database analysis using prokaryotic DNA kinase sequences as
probe, followed by PCR of a human fibroblast cDNA library, Lerner et al.
(2001) cloned NADK. The deduced 446-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 49.2 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.0-kb
transcript with high expression in placenta, moderate expression in
brain, colon, heart, liver, kidney, lung, spleen, stomach, and testis,
and low expression in small intestine. A band of 1.8 kb was detected in
several tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Using recombinant NADK overexpressed in E. coli, Lerner et al. (2001)
showed that purified NADK catalyzed the synthesis of NADP from NAD and
ATP. By gel filtration analysis, they determined that catalytically
active human NADK was a homotetramer. NADK exhibited a specific activity
of 6.7 microM with a high specificity for NAD and ATP substrates. NADK
activity was resistant to heat treatment, had an optimum pH of 7-8, and
required divalent cations. NADK displayed a preference for zinc and
manganese ions over magnesium ions, while copper and nickel ions had no
effect on enzyme activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lerner et al. (2001) determined that the NADK gene contains 11 exons
spanning 14 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lerner et al. (2001) mapped the NADK gene
to chromosome 1p36.33-p36.21.

602738	TITLE *602738 KARYOPHERIN BETA-1; KPNB1
;;IMPORTIN BETA-1
DESCRIPTION The import of proteins into the nucleus proceeds through the nuclear
pore complex. Cytoplasmic proteins with a nuclear localization signal
(NLS) bind to an importin-alpha (see 600685)/importin-beta heterodimer.
The trimeric complex docks to the cytoplasmic periphery of the nuclear
pore complex and is subsequently translocated through as a single
entity. The import reaction is terminated by the direct binding of RAN
(601179) to KPNB, which dissociates the importin heterodimer.

CLONING

Gorlich et al. (1995) purified a 90-kD subunit of importin (importin-90)
from Xenopus egg extracts and obtained a 188-amino acid partial protein
sequence from internal peptides. Using the partial amino acid sequence,
they isolated cDNAs encoding human importin-90, or KPNB1, from a HeLa
cell cDNA library. The sequence of the predicted 876-amino acid human
KPNB1 protein is 93% identical to the 188-amino acid partial sequence of
Xenopus importin-90. Gorlich et al. (1995) showed that Xenopus
importin-60 and importin-90 cooperate to form an import receptor that
distinguishes functional NLSs from nonfunctional ones and selectively
binds import substrates to the nuclear envelope. Independently, Chi et
al. (1995) identified cDNAs encoding human KPNB1. Based on the 97-kD
product of in vitro translation, they designated the protein p97. Using
a monoclonal antibody against bovine p97, Chi et al. (1995) localized
p97 to the cytoplasm and nuclear envelope of bovine kidney cells. These
authors found that recombinant human p97 binds zinc and that a bound
metal ion is required for nuclear envelope-binding activity. Kutay et
al. (1997) identified the regions of KPNB1 that interact with RAN,
importin-alpha, and the nuclear pore complex.

GENE FUNCTION

The guanosine triphosphatase Ran (601179) stimulates assembly of
microtubule asters and spindles in mitotic Xenopus egg extracts. A
carboxy-terminal region of the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NUMA;
164009), a nuclear protein required for organizing mitotic spindle
poles, mimics Ran's ability to induce asters. This NUMA fragment also
specifically interacted with importin-beta. Wiese et al. (2001) showed
that importin-beta is an inhibitor of microtubule aster assembly in
Xenopus egg extracts and that Ran regulates the interaction between
importin-beta and NUMA. Importin-beta therefore links NUMA to regulation
by Ran. Wiese et al. (2001) concluded that this suggests that similar
mechanisms regulate nuclear import during interphase and spindle
assembly during mitosis.

The survival of motor neuron (SMN1; 600354) protein is mutated in
patients with spinal muscular atrophy. SMN is part of a multiprotein
complex required for biogenesis of the Sm class of small nuclear
ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). Following assembly of the Sm core domain,
snRNPs are transported to the nucleus via importin-beta. Sm snRNPs
contain a nuclear localization signal (NLS) consisting of a
2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (TMG) cap and the Sm core. Snurportin-1
(607902) is the adaptor protein that recognizes both the TMG cap and
importin-beta. Narayanan et al. (2002) reported that a mutant snurportin
construct lacking the importin-beta-binding (IBB) domain, but containing
an intact TMG cap-binding domain, localized primarily to the nucleus,
whereas full-length snurportin localized to the cytoplasm. Snurportin
interacted with SMN, Gemin3 (606168), Sm snRNPs, and importin-beta. In
the presence of ribonucleases, the interactions with SMN and Sm proteins
were abolished, suggesting that snRNAs may mediate this interplay. Cell
fractionation studies showed that snurportin bound preferentially to
cytoplasmic SMN complexes. Additionally, SMN directly interacted with
importin-beta in a GST-pull-down assay, suggesting that the SMN complex
may represent the Sm core NLS receptor predicted by previous studies.
The authors concluded that, following Sm protein assembly, the SMN
complex may persist until the final stages of cytoplasmic snRNP
maturation, and may provide somatic cell RNPs with an alternative NLS.

Using a library of endoribonuclease-prepared short interfering RNAs
(esiRNAs), Kittler et al. (2004) identified 37 genes required for cell
division, one of which was KPNB1. These 37 genes included several
splicing factors for which knockdown generates mitotic spindle defects.
In addition, a putative nuclear-export terminator was found to speed up
cell proliferation and mitotic progression after knockdown.

Caudron et al. (2005) reported that the spatial cues necessary for
microtubules to reproducibly self-organize during cell division are
provided by chromosome-mediated interaction gradients between the small
guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Ran and importin-beta. This produces
activity gradients that determine the spatial distribution of
microtubule nucleation and stabilization around chromosomes and that are
essential for the self-organization of microtubules into a bipolar
spindle.

Kalab et al. (2006) examined the Ran-importin-beta system in cells by
conventional and fluorescence lifetime microscopy using a biosensor,
termed Rango, that increases its fluorescence resonance energy transfer
signal when released from importin-beta by RanGTP. Rango is
predominantly free in mitotic cells, but is further liberated around
mitotic chromatin. In vitro experiments and modeling showed that this
localized increase of free cargoes corresponds to changes in RanGTP
concentration sufficient to stabilize microtubules in extracts. In
cells, the Ran-importin-beta-cargo gradient kinetically promotes spindle
formation but is largely dispensable once the spindle has been
established. Kalab et al. (2006) observed that the Ran system also
affects spindle pole formation and chromosome congression in vivo. Kalab
et al. (2006) concluded that conserved Ran-regulated pathways are
involved in multiple, parallel processes required for spindle function,
but that their relative contribution differs in chromatin- versus
centrosome/kinetochore-driven spindle assembly systems.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Bayliss et al. (2000) described the crystal structure of a complex
between KPNB1 residues 1 to 442 and 5 tandem FxFG nucleoporin repeats
from yeast Nsp1.

Lee et al. (2003) showed the crystal structure of importin-beta
complexed with the active form of SREBP2 (600481). Importin-beta uses
characteristic long helices like a pair of chopsticks to interact with
an SREBP2 dimer. Importin-beta changes its conformation to reveal a
pseudo-2-fold symmetry on its surface structure so that it can
accommodate a symmetric dimer molecule.

To provide a basis for understanding the crucial cargo-release step of
nuclear import, Lee et al. (2005) presented the crystal structure of
full-length yeast importin-beta (Kap95) complexed with RanGTP (see
602362). Lee et al. (2005) identified a key interaction site where the
RanGTP switch I loop binds to the carboxy-terminal arch of Kap95. This
interaction produced a change in helicoidal pitch that locks Kap95 in a
conformation that cannot bind importin-alpha (see 600685) or cargo. Lee
et al. (2005) suggested an allosteric mechanism for nuclear import
complex disassembly by RanGTP.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ayala-Madrigal et al. (2000)
mapped the KPNB1 gene to chromosome 17q21. By FISH, Matsuda et al.
(1996) mapped the mouse Kpnb1 gene to the proximal end of chromosome
11D.

611731	TITLE *611731 APC GENE; APC
;;DELETED IN POLYPOSIS 2.5; DP2.5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The APC gene encodes a multidomain protein that plays a major role in
tumor suppression by antagonizing the WNT (see WNT1; 164820) signaling
pathway. Inappropriate activation of this pathway through loss of APC
function contributes to cancer progression, as in familial adenomatous
polyposis (FAP; 175100). APC also has a role in cell migration,
adhesion, chromosome segregation, spindle assembly, apoptosis, and
neuronal differentiation (Hanson and Miller, 2005).

The APC protein is an integral part of the beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806)
signaling pathway.

CLONING

The APC gene was identified and cloned simultaneously and independently
by 2 groups: the group of Bert Vogelstein in Baltimore, in collaboration
with the group of Yusuke Nakamura in Tokyo (Kinzler et al., 1991;
Nishisho et al., 1991), and the group of Ray White in Salt Lake City
(Groden et al., 1991; Joslyn et al., 1991). The deduced 2,843-residue
protein has a molecular mass of 311.8 kD. The protein sequence does not
contain transmembrane regions or nuclear targeting signals, suggesting
cytoplasmic localization.

Kinzler et al. (1991) identified several genes within a 5.5-Mb region of
DNA linked to FAP. All were expressed in normal colonic mucosa: FER
(176942), MCC (159350), SRP19 (182175), and TB2 (REEP5; 125265), in
addition to the APC gene itself. The APC gene product was predicted to
contain coiled-coil regions and was expressed in a wide variety of
tissues.

Joslyn et al. (1991) identified 3 genes within small deleted regions on
chromosome 5q12 found in 2 unrelated patients with FAP. One of these,
termed DP2.5, was found by Groden et al. (1991) to be the APC gene. The
other 2 genes identified by Joslyn et al. (1991) were SRP19 and DP1
(REEP5). Northern blot analysis by Groden et al. (1991) identified a
10-kb APC mRNA.

Hampton et al. (1992) isolated 2 overlapping YACs containing the MCC
gene; one of the YACs also included the complete APC gene.

Lambertz and Ballhausen (1993) isolated cDNA clones representing
transcripts expressed in human fetal brain and coding for the 5-prime
end of the APC gene. Sequence analyses revealed an alternative 5-prime
untranslated region comprising at least 103 bp. This finding suggested
that 2 APC-specific promoter elements exist, giving rise to 2 different
untranslated regions. Within the alternative UTR, Lambertz and
Ballhausen (1993) identified 3 additional AUG codons, located 5-prime to
the intrinsic APC initiation site. The authors suggested that these
codons may be relevant for the translational regulation of APC gene
expression.

Horii et al. (1993) noted that transcriptional initiation of APC occurs
at 3 sites in 2 distinct nontranslated exons at the 5-prime end of the
gene. Studies of transcripts from human colorectal tumor cell lines
suggested the presence of mutations in the transcriptional control
region. Horii et al. (1993) also detected at least 5 different forms of
5-prime noncoding sequences which were generated by alternative
splicing. They stated that the splicing mechanism appeared to be
regulated in a tissue-specific fashion, and 1 transcript, expressed
exclusively in brain, contained an extra exon.

GENE STRUCTURE

Groden et al. (1991) determined that the APC gene contains 15 exons.

Sulekova and Ballhausen (1995) identified a novel coding exon of the APC
gene. To that point, the 54-bp exon (exon 10A) was the smallest coding
exon in the gene, and was located 1.6-kb downstream from exon 10. It is
alternatively spliced and inserted in-frame into mature transcripts; it
gives an APC protein with an additional 18 amino acids. APC exon 10A
flanking sequences were presented so that this exon could be included in
mutation screening procedures.

Xia et al. (1995) described an alternatively spliced APC transcript
which had not been reported previously. Within this transcript, they
found an evolutionarily conserved but previously unidentified exon
between the known exons 10 and 11. The exon contains a heptad repeat
motif.

Karagianni et al. (2005) identified an alternatively spliced Apc
transcript in mouse embryonic stem cells and colon tissue. The
transcript contains an untranslated exon, which the authors designated
exon N. Transcripts bearing exon N spliced to either exon 1 or exon 2
were detected in all mouse tissues examined. A promoter region within
exon N has features of a housekeeping gene, including high average GC
content and lack of CAAT and TATA boxes. Karagianni et al. (2005) mapped
the promoter about 40 kb upstream of the initiating methionine, and
transient transfection experiments showed strong promoter activity.

GENE FUNCTION

Hoshino et al. (1991) found that fragments of chromosome 5, including
the region containing the APC gene, suppressed tumor activity when
transferred into NIH-3T3 cells that had been transformed with Kirsten
sarcoma virus.

Rubinfeld et al. (1993) and Su et al. (1993) found that APC associated
with both beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806) and alpha-catenin (CTNNA1;
116805). Since both proteins bind to the cell adhesion molecule
E-cadherin (192090), the results suggested that APC is involved in cell
adhesion.

Peifer (1993) reviewed the role of the catenins in Drosophila and
extrapolated the likely significance of the beta-catenin-APC
interaction. One possibility is that the APC complex regulates
transmission of the contact inhibition signal into the cell. This
hypothesis would be consistent with the observation that APC mutations
are associated with the development of hyperplasia, an early event in
tumorigenesis. A second possibility is that the APC-catenin complex
regulates adhesion. Although this idea is supported by evidence that
loss of cadherin-mediated adhesion can contribute to metastasis, it
would be less consistent with the evidence that APC acts early in
tumorigenesis.

Smith et al. (1993) produced monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to APC
for characterizing the protein in normal and tumor cells. They found
that 81% of colon tumor cell lines were totally devoid of the normal,
full-length protein, whereas 40 cell lines derived from sporadic tumors
of other organs had only full-length APC. Immunohistochemical analysis
of APC in normal colonic mucosa demonstrated cytoplasmic staining with
more intense staining in the basolateral margins of the epithelial
cells. The staining was markedly increased in the upper portions of the
crypts, suggesting an increased level of expression with maturation.

Miyashiro et al. (1995) discussed findings that suggested an important
link between the role of APC in tumor initiation and the process of
cellular adhesion. Immunohistochemical studies in normal mouse intestine
suggested that a portion of the APC protein is localized in the lateral
cytoplasm of intestinal epithelial cells and functions in cooperation
with catenins, whereas the APC protein in microvilli and in the apical
cytoplasm has other functions independent of catenins.

Matsumine et al. (1996) showed that the APC-beta-catenin complex binds
to DLG (see 601014), the human homolog of the Drosophila discs large
tumor suppressor protein. This interaction required the
carboxyl-terminal region of APC and the homology repeat region of DLG.
APC colocalized with DLG at the lateral cytoplasm in rat colon
epithelial cells and at the synapse in cultured hippocampal neurons.
Matsumine et al. (1996) suggested that the APC-DLG complex may
participate in regulation of both cell cycle progression and neuronal
function.

Rubinfeld et al. (1996) showed that when beta-catenin is present in
excess, APC binds to a human homolog of 'Armadillo,' glycogen synthase
kinase 3-beta (GSK3B; 605004), a component of the Wingless signaling
pathway in Drosophila development.

Midgley et al. (1997) developed antisera to APC N- and C-terminal
epitopes. They found that the APC protein was expressed in epithelial
and mesenchymal cells in many tissues. In epithelium of bladder, small
and large intestine, esophagus, stomach, and epidermis, APC expression
was restricted to regions where cell replication has ceased and terminal
differentiation is established. APC staining was often diffusely
cytoplasmic; however, in surface cells there was accentuated expression
in the subapical regions and along the lateral margins. Midgley et al.
(1997) concluded that this distribution is compatible with APC function
related to signaling at the adherens junction and indicates that APC
plays a role in cells committed to terminal differentiation.

In mouse epithelial cells, Roose et al. (1999) found that TCF7 (189908)
was one of the targets of the beta-catenin/TCF4 interaction. Roose et
al. (1999) suggested that TCF7 may act as a feedback repressor of
beta-catenin/TCF4 target genes, and thus may cooperate with APC to
suppress malignant transformation of epithelial cells.

Using immunofluorescence microscopy, Neufeld and White (1997) found that
full-length APC protein was present in both the nucleus and the
cytoplasm of human mammary epithelial cells. The nuclear APC protein was
concentrated in discrete subnuclear regions, including the nucleoli,
whereas the cytoplasmic APC protein concentrated at the leading edge of
migrating cells. Colocalization of APC protein with rRNA confirmed a
nucleolar localization. Cell fractionation studies demonstrated
full-length APC protein in both the membrane/cytoskeletal and the
nuclear fractions. Neufeld et al. (2000) demonstrated that nuclear
export of APC is mediated by 2 intrinsic, leucine-rich, nuclear export
signals (NESs) located near the amino terminus. Each NES was able to
induce the nuclear export of a fused carrier protein. Mutation of both
APC NESs resulted in the nuclear accumulation of the full-length APC
protein of approximately 320 kD, further establishing that the 2
intrinsic APC NESs are necessary for APC protein nuclear export.
Moreover, endogenous APC accumulated in the nucleus of cells treated
with the Crm1-specific nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B. Together,
these data indicated that APC is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein
whose predominantly cytoplasmic localization requires NES function, and
suggested that APC may be important for signaling between the nuclear
and cytoplasmic compartments of epithelial cells.

Kawasaki et al. (2000) cloned a gene, ASEF (605216), whose protein
product was shown to directly interact with APC. ASEF immunoprecipitated
with beta-catenin; however, ASEF and beta-catenin did not interact
directly, suggesting that ASEF, APC, and beta-catenin are found in the
same complex in vivo. Kawasaki et al. (2000) suggested that the APC-ASEF
complex may regulate the actin cytoskeletal network, cell morphology and
migration, and neuronal function.

Kaplan et al. (2001) showed that, during mitosis, wildtype APC localized
to the ends of microtubules embedded in kinetochores and formed a
complex with the checkpoint proteins Bub1 (602452) and Bub3 (603719). In
vitro, APC was a high-affinity substrate for Bub kinases. Cells carrying
a truncated APC gene were defective in chromosome segregation. Kaplan et
al. (2001) concluded that there is a role for APC in
kinetochore-microtubule attachment, and suggested that truncations in
APC that eliminate microtubule binding may contribute to chromosomal
instability in cancer cells.

By immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays using cells from FAP
patients, cells from nonfamilial colorectal carcinoma patients, and
normal human fetal lung fibroblasts, Homma et al. (2002) found that APC
associated with the alpha (CSNK2A1; 115440) and beta (CSNK2B; 115441)
subunits of casein kinase-2 (CK2). APC preferentially interacted with
the tetrameric CK2 holoenzyme. In synchronized cells, association of APC
with CK2 was cell cycle dependent. Full-length APC inhibited CK2
activity in vitro, and mutation analysis localized the inhibitory region
to the C terminus of APC, between residues 2086 and 2394.

In a cell migration assay using primary rat astrocytes,
Etienne-Manneville and Hall (2003) demonstrated that PAR6-PKC-zeta
(176982) interacted with and regulated GSK3-beta to promote polarization
of the centrosome and to control the direction of cell protrusion. CDC42
(116952)-dependent phosphorylation of GSK3-beta occurred specifically at
the leading edge of migrating cells, and induced the interaction of APC
protein with the plus ends of microtubules. The association of APC with
microtubules was essential for cell polarization.

Yamashita et al. (2003) found that dividing Drosophila male germline
stem cells used intracellular mechanisms involving centrosome function
and cortically localized APC protein to orient mitotic spindles
perpendicular to the niche, ensuring a reliably asymmetric outcome in
which 1 daughter cell remains in the niche and self-renews stem cell
identity, whereas the other, displaced away, initiates differentiation.

In cultured murine myocytes, Wang et al. (2003) found that agrin
(103320)-induced acetylcholine receptor (AChR) postsynaptic aggregation
required APC, which was found to colocalize and bind specifically to the
AChR beta subunit (100710). The interaction occurred downstream of MuSK
(601296) activation. Wang et al. (2003) suggested that a direct
interaction between APC and the AChR beta subunit may link AChR to the
cytoskeleton, helping to localize the receptors to the neuromuscular
junction.

Using microarray and RT-PCR analyses, Jette et al. (2004) found that
expression of 2 retinoid biosynthesis genes, RDH5 (601617) and RDHL
(DHRS9; 612131), was reduced in colon adenomas and carcinomas compared
with normal controls. Reintroduction of wildtype APC into an
APC-deficient colon carcinoma cell line increased expression of RDHL
without affecting RDH5. Induction of RDHL by APC appeared to depend on
the presence of CDX2 (600297).

Choi et al. (2004) found that APC was downregulated by the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in human 293T cells and that Wnt signaling
inhibited this process. APC was ubiquitinated directly, and axin (AXIN1;
603816), which is present in the same protein complex as APC,
facilitated APC downregulation. Furthermore, Choi et al. (2004) found
that treatment of human 293T cells with WNT3A (606359) led to
accumulation of APC and beta-catenin in nuclear lysates, providing
support for the hypothesis that APC has a role in shuttling beta-catenin
in and out of the nucleus.

Watanabe et al. (2004) found that monkey Iqgap1 (603379) and Apc
interacted directly via the armadillo repeats of Apc and the C terminus
of Iqgap1. Clip170 (179838) also immunoprecipitated with Apc and Iqgap1.
Apc and Iqgap1 localized interdependently to the leading edge in
migrating Vero cells, and transfection of cells with constitutively
active human IQGAP1 provided accumulation sites with APC in a manner
dependent on actin filaments. Watanabe et al. (2004) concluded that RAC1
(602048) and CDC42 recruit the IQGAP1/APC complex and that IQGAP1 links
APC to actin filaments for cell polarization and directional migration.

By fractionating human and canine cell lysates over glycerol gradients,
Penman et al. (2005) identified 2 distinct soluble protein pools
containing APC. One of these pools represented fully assembled
beta-catenin-targeting complexes. The second pool contained at least 2
different forms of APC: APC that was bound to partially assembled
beta-catenin-targeting complexes and APC that could bind microtubules.
Formation of fully assembled beta-catenin-targeting complexes was
reduced by inhibitors of GSK3B. Highly elevated levels of beta-catenin
in tumor cells correlated with decreased ability of endogenous APC to
bind microtubules. Furthermore, APC lacking the direct
microtubule-binding site was more effective at downregulating
beta-catenin. Penman et al. (2005) concluded that interaction of APC
with microtubules and with the beta-catenin-targeting complex are
mutually exclusive.

By examining degradation of beta-catenin in human colon cancer cell
lines with different APC truncations, Yang et al. (2006) determined that
APC regulates beta-catenin phosphorylation and ubiquitination by
distinct domains and by separate molecular mechanisms.

Migrating fibroblasts polarize to form a leading edge and a tail in a
process that involves asymmetric distribution of RNAs. Mili et al.
(2008) used a fractionation scheme combined with microarrays to analyze
protruding pseudopodia of mouse fibroblasts in response to migratory
stimuli. Mili et al. (2008) found that a diverse group of RNAs
accumulates in such pseudopodial protrusions. Through their 3-prime
untranslated regions these transcripts are anchored in granules
concentrated at the plus ends of detyrosinated microtubules. RNAs in the
granules associate with the APC tumor suppressor and FMRP (309550). APC
is required for the accumulation of transcripts in protrusions. Mili et
al. (2008) concluded that their results suggested a new type of RNA
anchoring mechanism as well as an unanticipated function for APC in
localizing RNAs.

- APC Gene Function in Disease

Unlike some other tumor suppressor genes, loss or mutation in the
wildtype gene is not essential to the development of intestinal polyps
(Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990). In a review, Kinzler and Vogelstein
(1996) noted that the APC gene serves as a gatekeeper in colonic
epithelial cells. The wildtype APC allele is lost in a great majority of
colorectal tumors of both sporadic and FAP patients, consistent with the
Knudson 2-hit model.

Powell et al. (1992) presented evidence that APC mutations occur early
during colorectal tumorigenesis. Sequence analysis of 41 colorectal
tumors revealed that most carcinomas (60%) and adenomas (63%) contained
a mutated APC gene. Mutations of the APC gene were found in the earliest
tumors that could be analyzed, including adenomas as small as 0.5 cm in
diameter, and the frequency of such mutations remained constant as
tumors progressed from benign to malignant stages. This finding provided
support for the multistage process of colorectal carcinogenesis with the
APC gene at or near the initial step (Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990).

Fearon (1997) reviewed more than 20 different hereditary cancer
syndromes that had been defined and attributed to specific germline
mutations in various inherited cancer genes. A useful diagram
illustrated how APC protein regulates beta-catenin levels in normal
cells, and how mutations in APC or CTNNB1 in cancer cell genes
deregulate cell growth via TCF4.

He et al. (1998) identified the c-myc (190080) oncogene as a target gene
in the beta-catenin signaling pathway. Expression of MYC was shown to be
repressed by wildtype APC and activated by beta-catenin, and these
effects were mediated through TCF4 binding sites in the MYC promoter.

FAP is associated with an increased risk of developing papillary thyroid
carcinomas (188550). A significant fraction of sporadic human papillary
thyroid carcinomas have RET protooncogene rearrangements that generate
chimeric transforming oncogenes designated RET/PTC (see RET; 164761).
Cetta et al. (1998) found RET/PTC1 oncogene activation in 2 of 3
papillary carcinomas from an FAP kindred, and in the papillary carcinoma
of a second FAP kindred. These findings showed that loss of function of
APC coexists with gain of function of RET in some papillary thyroid
carcinomas, suggesting that RET/PTC1 oncogene activation could be a
progression step in the development of FAP-associated thyroid tumors.

Soravia et al. (1999) described 2 FAP kindreds with thyroid cancer and
different germline APC mutations (611731.0038 and 611731.0039,
respectively). In 3 FAP patients, RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 were expressed
in thyroid cancers; no positivity was observed for RET/PTC2. The
findings suggested that loss of APC function and gain of RET/PTC
function is an early event in FAP-associated thyroid tumorigenesis.

Lamlum et al. (1999) assembled evidence that APC mutations may not
result in simple loss of protein function. They found that FAP patients
with germline APC mutations within a small region (codons 1194 to 1392
at most) showed mainly allelic loss in their colorectal adenomas, in
contrast to other FAP patients, whose 'second hits' tended to occur by
truncating mutations in the mutation cluster region. These results
indicated that different APC mutations provide cells with different
selective advantages, with mutations close to codon 1300 providing the
greatest advantage. Allelic loss was selected strongly in cells with 1
mutation near codon 1300. A different germline-somatic APC mutation
association existed in FAP desmoids. Lamlum et al. (1999) concluded that
APC is not, therefore, a classic tumor suppressor. Their findings
indicated a new mechanism for disease severity: if a broader spectrum of
mutations is selected in tumors, the somatic mutation rate is
effectively higher, and more tumors grow.

Dihlmann et al. (1999) provided experimental evidence for a
dominant-negative effect of APC gene products associated with severe
polyposis. Wildtype APC activity in beta-catenin/TCF-mediated
transcription was strongly inhibited by a mutant APC that is truncated
at codon 1309 (611731.0023). In contrast, mutant APC gene products that
are associated with attenuated polyposis, such as those involving codon
386 or 1465 (611731.0019), interfered only weakly with wildtype APC
activity. These results suggested a molecular explanation for the
genotype-phenotype correlation in FAP patients and supported the idea
that colorectal tumor growth might be, in part, driven by selection for
a mutation in the 'mutation cluster region' (MCR).

Lamlum et al. (1999) noted that APC seems to act as a tumor-suppressor
gene in a 'nonclassical' fashion: the site of the germline mutation
determines the type of 'second hit' in FAP tumors, and simple protein
inactivation is selected weakly, if at all. In a screening of 210
colorectal adenomas from 35 FAP patients, Lamlum et al. (1999) found
that patients with germline APC mutations around codon 1300 tended to
acquire their second hit by allelic loss and had more severe disease.
Other FAP patients tended to acquire their second hit by a truncating
mutation in the MCR region of the APC gene.

Of 40 colorectal cancer cell lines, Rowan et al. (2000) found that 32
(83%) showed evidence of APC mutation and/or allelic loss. The authors
identified several APC mutations and found a hotspot for somatic
mutation in sporadic colorectal tumors at codon 1554. The results
suggested that APC mutations occur in most colorectal cancers. When
combined with previously published data, their results showed that there
is interdependence of the 2 hits at APC in sporadic colorectal tumors as
well as in FAP. APC mutations in the MCR, especially those close to
codon 1300, were associated with allelic loss, whereas tumors with
mutations outside this region tended to harbor truncating mutations. The
causes of this phenomenon were thought to be selection for retained
N-terminal and lost C-terminal APC functions, effects on beta-catenin
levels, and APC protein stability.

Rosin-Arbesfeld et al. (2000) showed that APC contains highly conserved
nuclear export signals 3-prime adjacent to the mutation cluster region
that enable it to exit from the nucleus. Mutant APC in cancer cells lost
this ability, ultimately resulting in the nuclear accumulation of
beta-catenin. The findings suggested that the ability of APC to exit
from the nucleus is critical for its tumor suppressor function.

In 2 families from Singapore with FAP, Cao et al. (2000) identified 2
deletions in the APC gene at exons 11 and 14, respectively. By mapping
the precise breakpoints, Cao et al. (2001) confirmed that these
deletions encompassed about 2 kb and 6 kb of the genomic regions
encompassing exons 11 and 14, respectively. Detailed sequence analysis
suggested that the 2-kb exon 11 deletion was most likely generated by a
topoisomerase-I (TOP1; 126420)-mediated nonhomologous recombination and
the 6-kb exon 14 deletion by an Alu-Alu homologous recombination. In the
case of the first deletion, both 5-prime and 3-prime breakpoints had 2
topoisomerase I recognition sites and runs of pyrimidines within the
10-bp sequences in their vicinity. This was thought to be the first
report of a topoisomerase-I-mediated germline mutation in a tumor
suppressor gene. Both deletions resulted in truncated APC proteins
missing the beta-catenin and axin-binding domains, resulting in severe
polyposis and cancer.

Fearnhead et al. (2001) reviewed understanding of how mutations in the
APC gene translate into changes at the protein level, which in turn
contribute to the role of APC in tumorigenesis.

Yan et al. (2002) found that slightly lower levels of APC expression
were associated with a pronounced predisposition to hereditary
colorectal tumors. No APC mutations were identified in a family with FAP
associated with partial reduction in APC protein expression, but
neoplastic tissue showed loss of the normal allele. Yan et al. (2002)
identified a second case with no structural changes in the APC gene, but
a reduced level of expression of APC. The mutations responsible for the
reduced expression presumably resided deep within an intron or far
upstream of the gene in the affected allele. The data were consistent
with a threshold for APC product being required to suppress intestinal
tumorigenesis, and suggested that the threshold is finely balanced.

Albuquerque et al. (2002) analyzed somatic APC point mutations and LOH
in 133 colorectal adenomas from 6 FAP patients. They observed that when
germline mutations resulted in truncated proteins without any of the 7
beta-catenin downregulating 20-amino acid repeats distributed in the
central domain of APC, the majority of the corresponding somatic point
mutations retained 1 or, less frequently, of the same 20-amino acid
repeats. Conversely, when the germline mutation resulted in a truncated
protein retaining one 20-amino acid repeat, most second hits removed all
20-amino acid repeats. The latter was frequently accomplished by allelic
loss. Notably, and in contrast to previous observations, in a patient
where the germline APC mutation retained 2 such repeats, the majority of
the somatic hits were point mutations (and not LOH) located upstream,
which removed all of the 20-amino acid repeats. These results indicated
selection for APC genotypes that are likely to retain some activity in
downregulating beta-catenin (116806) signaling. The authors proposed
that this selection process is aimed at a specific degree of
beta-catenin signaling optimal for tumor formation, rather than at its
constitutive activation by deletion of all of the beta-catenin
downregulating motifs in APC.

Goss et al. (2002) demonstrated that APC alleles with 5-prime mutations
produce APC protein that downregulates beta-catenin, inhibits
beta-catenin/T-cell factor-mediated transactivation, and induces
cell-cycle arrest. Transfection studies demonstrated that
cap-independent translation is initiated internally at an AUG at codon
184 of APC. Furthermore, APC coding sequence between AAPC mutations and
AUG-184 permits internal ribosome entry in a bicistronic vector. These
data suggested that AAPC alleles in vivo may produce functional APC by
internal initiation and established a functional correlation between
5-prime APC mutations and their associated clinical phenotype.

A genetic model for colorectal cancer (Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990)
suggests that the sequential accumulation of mutations in specific
genes, i.e., APC, KRAS (KRAS2; 190070), and p53, drives the transition
from healthy colonic epithelia through increasingly dysplastic adenoma
to colorectal cancer. However, Smith et al. (2002) found that only 6.6%
of 100 colorectal cancer tumors had mutations in all 3 genes, with 38.7%
of tumors containing mutations in only 1 of the 3 genes. The most common
combination of mutations was p53 and APC (27.1%), whereas mutations in
both p53 and KRAS were extremely rare. Statistical analysis confirmed
that mutations in KRAS and p53 cooccurred less frequently than expected
by chance. The findings suggested that these mutations lie in alternate
pathways, and that there are multiple genetic pathways to colorectal
cancer.

Green and Kaplan (2003) found that conditional expression of a truncated
form of APC in HEK293 cells, which express wildtype APC, dominantly
interfered with microtubule plus-end attachments, recapitulating the
phenotype observed in APC mutant tumor cells. The authors proposed that
APC functions to modulate microtubule plus-end attachments during
mitosis, and that a mutant APC allele predisposes cells to increased
mitotic abnormalities, which may contribute to tumor progression.

Kawasaki et al. (2003) showed that overexpression of ASEF (605216)
decreased E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and promoted the
migration of epithelial canine kidney cells. Both of these activities
were stimulated by truncated APC proteins expressed in human colorectal
tumor cells. Experiments based on RNA interference and dominant-negative
mutants showed that both ASEF and mutated APC were required for the
migration of colorectal tumor cells expressing truncated APC. Kawasaki
et al. (2003) concluded that the APC-ASEF complex functions in cell
migration as well as in E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, and that
truncated APC present in colorectal tumor cells contributes to their
aberrant migratory properties.

Takacs et al. (2008) demonstrated that Drosophila APC homologs have an
activating role in both physiologic and ectopic Wnt/Wingless (see
164820) signaling. The Apc amino terminus is important for its
activating function, whereas the beta-catenin binding sites are
dispensable. Takacs et al. (2008) suggested that APC likely promotes
Wingless transduction through downregulation of Axin (603816), a
negative regulator of Wingless signaling. Takacs et al. (2008) suggested
that, given the evolutionary conservation of APC in Wnt signal
transduction, an activating role may also be present in vertebrates with
relevance to development and cancer.

In FAP, beta-catenin is stabilized constitutively, providing a permanent
mitogenic signal to normally resting cells. This occurs when the second
allele of APC is inactivated somatically. Kohler et al. (2009) described
an APC domain, the beta-catenin inhibitory domain (CID), that is located
between the second and third 20-amino acid beta-catenin-binding repeats
and therefore was present in many truncated APC products found in human
tumours. In truncated APC, the CID was absolutely necessary to
downregulate the transcriptional activity and the level of beta-catenin,
even when an axin/conductin binding site was present. The activity of
the CID was dramatically reduced in several colon cancer cell lines and
could be inhibited by shorter truncated APC lacking the CID. The authors
concluded that CID is a direct target of the selective pressure acting
on APC during tumorigenesis, and it explains the interdependence of both
APC mutations in colorectal, duodenal, and desmoid tumours.

Zhang et al. (2010) showed that deficiency in the APC gene and
subsequent activation of beta-catenin lead to the repression of cellular
caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP (603599) expression through activation of
c-Myc (190080), and that all-trans-retinyl acetate (RAc) independently
upregulates tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL; 603598) death receptors and suppresses decoy receptors. Thus,
the combination of TRAIL and RAc induces apoptosis in APC-deficient
premalignant cells without affecting normal cells in vitro. In addition,
Zhang et al. (2010) showed that short-term and noncontinuous TRAIL and
RAc treatment induced apoptosis specifically in intestinal polyps,
strongly inhibited tumor growth, and prolonged survival in 'multiple
intestinal neoplasms' (Min) mice. With their approach, Zhang et al.
(2010) further demonstrated that TRAIL and RAc induced significant cell
death in human colon polyps, providing a potentially selective approach
for colorectal cancer chemoprevention by targeting APC-deficient cells
for apoptosis.

Lane et al. (2010) found evidence of reduced APC expression in patients
with 5q- syndrome (153550) compared with healthy controls and patients
with low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Germline and Somatic Mutations in the APC Gene

In 4 unrelated patients with familial adenomatous polyposis-1 (FAP1;
175100), Groden et al. (1991) identified 4 different heterozygous
inactivating mutations in the APC gene (611731.0001-611731.0004).

In the germline of 5 patients with FAP1 or Gardner syndrome, Nishisho et
al. (1991) identified 4 point mutations in the APC gene
(611731.0005-611731.00008) using both the ribonuclease (RNase)
protection assay on PCR-amplified DNA and direct sequencing of cloned
PCR products. One mutation (611731.0006) was found in 2 unrelated
patients: 1 with isolated FAP and the other with Gardner syndrome.
Nishisho et al. (1991) also identified somatic mutations in the APC gene
(see, e.g., 611731.0009) in 4 of 158 colorectal cancers isolated from
patients with sporadic disease.

Miyoshi et al. (1992) identified germline mutations in the APC gene in
53 (67%) of 79 unrelated FAP patients. Twenty-eight mutations were small
deletions and 2 were insertions of 1 or 2 bp; 19 were point mutations
resulting in stop codons, and 4 were missense point mutations. Thus, 92%
of the mutations were predicted to result in truncation of the APC
protein. More than two-thirds (68%) of the mutations were clustered in
the 5-prime half of the last exon, and nearly two-fifths of the total
mutations occurred at 1 of 5 positions. The findings suggested that the
C terminal of the protein is required for proper function.

Using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), Fodde et al.
(1992) identified 8 different germline mutations in the APC gene (see,
e.g., 611731.0012-611731.0018) in Dutch patients with FAP. All the
mutations resulted in truncated proteins.

Seki et al. (1992) identified LOH at the APC locus in an adrenocortical
carcinoma from an FAP patient. Miyoshi et al. (1992) described loss of
heterozygosity at the APC locus in 30 (48%) of 63 colorectal adenomas or
carcinomas tumors, as well as somatic APC mutations in 43. Forty-one
(95%) of the mutations resulted in truncation of the APC protein. Over
60% of the somatic mutations were clustered within a small region of
exon 15 designated as the 'mutation cluster region' (MCR), which
accounted for less than 10% of the coding region. Mutations in the MCR
result in expression of COOH-terminally truncated proteins. Combining
all the data, more than 80% of tumors had at least one mutation in the
APC gene, of which more than 60% had 2 mutations. The results strongly
suggested that somatic mutations of the APC gene are associated with the
development of the great majority of colorectal tumors.

Using SSCP analysis, Cottrell et al. (1992) identified APC mutations in
patients with FAP and in colon cancer tissue from patients with sporadic
disease. All mutations resulted in truncated proteins. Their results
suggested that highly localized short sequences, such as runs that code
for adenine and thymine, may account for up to 20% of all observed APC
mutations. One 5-bp deletion was found in a sporadic colon tumor and in
4 unrelated APC patients. Cottrell et al. (1992) suggested that since
most mutations predict truncation of the APC protein, diagnosis might be
more conveniently detected through analysis of the APC protein.

Sen-Gupta et al. (1993) reported a somatic deletion mutation of the APC
gene in desmoid tissue in a patient reported by Hodgson et al. (1993) as
having FAP caused by a constitutional chromosome 5q22 deletion.

Nagase and Nakamura (1993) summarized the germline APC mutations in 174
FAP patients and in somatic APC mutations in 103 colorectal tumors, as
well as mutations in tumors arising in organs other than the colon and
rectum. They concluded that inactivation of both alleles at the APC
locus is required for development of most tumors in the colon and
rectum. The great majority of the known mutations would result in
truncation of the APC product. Almost all known mutations had been
located within the 5-prime half of the coding region, although somatic
mutations in colorectal tumors tended to cluster in the MCR, which
represents only 8% of the coding sequence (codons 1286-1513). It was
suggested that the location of germline mutations is correlated with the
number of colorectal polyps in FAP patients.

De Vries et al. (1996) described an on-line database of mutations in the
APC gene. Beroud and Soussi (1996) described a database of germline and
somatic mutations in the APC gene in human tumors and cell lines. The
database held 737 mutations, including 332 germline and 402 somatic.
Almost all led to truncation of the APC protein either by a nonsense
mutation (30%) or by a frameshift mutation (68%). Most of the mutations
occurred in the first half of the coding region. Germline mutations were
scattered throughout the 5-prime half of the gene, whereas somatic
mutations (60%) were concentrated in the MCR region. In germline
mutations, 2 hotspot codons were identified, one at position 1061 and
the second at position 1309. In somatic mutations, 2 hotspots occurred
at positions 1309 and 1450. The authors noted that the concentration of
mutations in the 5-prime part of the gene was believed to be involved in
a dominant effect of the N-terminus of the APC protein. This APC region
contains a dimerization domain and it has been demonstrated that
wildtype and mutant APC are associated in vivo.

Van der Luijt et al. (1997) identified 67 germline mutations, including
27 novel mutations, in the APC gene in 105 Dutch families with FAP.
Sixty-five mutations were detected using denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis (DGGE) for exons 1-14, and the protein truncation test
for the large exon 15. Most of the mutations were either frameshifts
(39/65) or single base substitutions (18/65), resulting in premature
stop codons. Splicing defects were identified in 7 cases and a
nonconservative amino acid change in 1 case. Southern blot analysis
detected APC structural rearrangements in 2 pedigrees by Southern blot
analysis.

Analyzing 2 sets of data, Marshall et al. (1997) commented on the
finding that 1- to 2-bp deletions and 1-bp insertions were much more
commonly found among somatic mutations of the APC gene than among
germline mutations of the APC gene. On the other hand, deletions of more
than 2 bp were much more frequent among the germline mutations than
among somatic mutations. Insertions of more than 1 bp were more frequent
in somatic mutations than in germline mutations. Possible explanations
for these differences were discussed.

Wallis et al. (1999) carried out mutation analysis of the APC gene in
205 families, comprised of 190 unrelated FAP and 15 non-FAP colorectal
cancer patients, using DGGE, PTT, and direct sequencing. Mutations
causing chain termination were identified only in patients in the FAP
group (105 patients). Amino acid substitutions were identified in 4
individuals, 3 of whom were in the non-FAP group.

Won et al. (1999) identified germline mutations of the APC gene in 38 of
62 (61%) unrelated Korean patients with FAP. The mutation was presumed
to be novel in 19. They found the protein truncation test to be superior
to SSCP analysis in the detection of germline mutations.

Approximately 80% of FAP patients can be shown to have truncating
mutations of the APC gene. To determine the cause of FAP in the other
20% of the patients, Laken et al. (1999) used MAMA (monoallelic mutation
analysis) to examine independently the status of each of the 2 APC
alleles. Of 9 patients analyzed, 7 were found to have significantly
reduced expression from 1 of their 2 alleles, whereas 2 patients were
found to have full-length expression from both alleles. Laken et al.
(1999) concluded that more than 95% of patients with FAP have
inactivating mutations in APC and that a combination of MAMA and
standard genetic tests will identify APC abnormalities in the vast
majority of such patients. That no APC expression from the mutant allele
is found in some FAP patients argues strongly against the requirement
for dominant-negative effects of APC mutations. The results also
suggested that there may be at least 1 additional gene besides APC that
can give rise to FAP. Laken et al. (1999) pointed out that APCL, a
homolog of APC located on 19p13.3, had been described by Nakagawa et al.
(1998) and van Es et al. (1999). This homolog, as well as the
functionally related family of axin genes (see 603816), are good
candidates for FAP causation in these kindreds.

In 4 FAP families, Su et al. (2000) identified pathogenic APC genomic
rearrangements resulting from homologous and nonhomologous
recombinations mediated by Alu elements. Two of these 4 rearrangements
were complex, involving deletion and insertion of nucleotides. These
rearrangements were initially revealed by analyzing cDNAs and could not
have been identified by using mutation detection methods that screened
each exon individually. The identification of 4 genomic rearrangements
among a total of 26 APC mutations in the study suggested that genomic
rearrangements are relatively frequent.

Lamlum et al. (2000) screened 164 unrelated patients with 'multiple'
(3-100) colorectal adenomas for germline variants throughout the APC
gene, including promoter mutations. In addition to 3 Ashkenazi patients
with I1307K (611731.0029), they found 7 patients with the E1317Q variant
(611731.0036) and 4 patients with truncating APC variants in exon 9 or
in the 3-prime part of the gene. Germline APC variants accounted for
approximately 10% of patients with multiple adenomas. The authors
recommended screening multiple adenoma patients for a restricted number
of germline APC variants, namely the missense changes E1317Q and I1307K
(if of Ashkenazi descent), and, if there is a family history of
colorectal tumors, for truncating mutations 5-prime to exon 5, in exon
9, and 3-prime to codon 1580.

In 34 of 917 unrelated FAP patients, Aretz et al. (2004) identified 26
different heterozygous mutations in the APC gene at or close to splice
sites; 6 of these occurred within exon sequences. Detailed analysis
showed that 1 variant in exon 4 and 3 variants in exon 14 resulted in
exon skipping due to aberrant splicing, likely related to disruption of
exonic splicing enhancers. Aretz et al. (2004) emphasized that the
consequences of some missense and silent mutations are manifest at the
DNA level and not the protein level. Aretz et al. (2004) found that a
common 5-bp deletion at codon 1309 (611731.0023) was overrepresented in
their group of patients with proven or suspected de novo mutations
compared with familial cases (34 of 96 vs 26 of 505, p less than 0.001),
supporting the view that the sequence around codon 1309 is a hotspot for
mutation. Using haplotype analysis, Aretz et al. (2004) traced the
parental origin of de novo mutations in 16 unrelated patients and found
that 4 were of maternal and 12 of paternal origin, suggesting a moderate
sex bias towards paternal origin. They noted that large deletions and
single-base substitutions were exclusively of paternal origin, whereas
small deletions were equally distributed.

Among tissue specimens from 174 FAP patients with known APC germline
mutations, Blaker et al. (2004) identified 8 tumors of types
infrequently seen in FAP. Second somatic APC mutations were found in 4
of the 8 tumors: a uterine adenocarcinoma, a hepatocellular adenoma, an
adrenocortical adenoma, and an epidermal cyst. These tumors showed an
elevated concentration of beta-catenin, but no mutations in the CTNNB1
gene. Blaker et al. (2004) stated that theirs was the first study
reporting second somatic APC mutations in FAP-associated uterine
adenocarcinoma and epidermal cysts, and concluded that their data
strengthened a role for impaired APC function in the pathogenesis of
adrenal and hepatic neoplasms in FAP patients.

Aretz et al. (2005) used the multiplex ligation-dependent probe
amplification (MLPA) method to screen 174 unrelated FAP patients in whom
no point mutation in the APC gene had been uncovered by PTT or
denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). They
identified 14 different deletions in 26 patients, ranging from single
exons to the whole gene including the promoter region. Almost all of the
deletions (22 of 26) were detected in the 46 patients with typical FAP,
whereas none were found in 93 patients with attenuated FAP. Aretz et al.
(2005) noted that a large deletion occurred in about half of the
apparently mutation-negative families with typical FAP, pointing to an
overall frequency of around 12% for large deletions in their series of
patients with typical FAP, compared to 75% for point mutations.

Charames et al. (2008) identified a large heterozygous deletion in the
APC promoter region, including promoter 1A and 5-prime untranslated
regions, in affected members of a large Canadian Mennonite kindred with
adenomatous polyposis coli and colon cancer. The authors were unable to
determined the precise limits of the large promoter deletion. The
mutation was shown to result in transcriptional silencing of the APC
allele. The findings were consistent with a founder effect in this
genetically isolated population.

- Other Cancers Caused by Somatic Mutation in the APC Gene

Oda et al. (1996) observed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the APC
and/or MCC loci in 4 (57%) of 7 informative hepatoblastoma (see 114550)
tissues derived from patients without FAP. Somatic mutations were
detected in 8 (61.5%) of the 13 total cases, with 9 cases (69%) showing
genetic alterations in the APC gene as LOH or somatic mutations (see,
e.g., 611731.0024). Double mutations were demonstrated in 2 cases. The
nature of the somatic mutations observed in this study was unusual
because 9 of the 10 mutations were missense, with only 1 case featuring
a frameshift mutation due to an insertion. By contrast, more than 90% of
mutations in the APC gene in colorectal tumors result in a truncated APC
protein due to either frameshift or nonsense mutations.

Among 46 medulloblastomas (see 155255) derived from patients with
sporadic disease and no FAP, Huang et al. (2000) identified 2 with
somatic mutations in the APC gene and 4 with somatic mutations in the
beta-catenin gene. This study provided the first evidence that APC
mutations are operative in a subset of sporadic medulloblastomas.

- Epigenetics

In a study of patients with stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer (see
211980) who underwent curative resection but had a recurrence compared
to matched patients who did not have a recurrence, Brock et al. (2008)
found that promoter methylation of the CDKN2A (600160), CDH13 (601364),
RASSF1A (605082), and APC genes in tumors and in histologically
tumor-negative lymph nodes was independently associated with tumor
recurrence.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

In 22 unrelated APC patients, Nagase et al. (1992) found that germline
mutations between codons 1250 and 1464 were associated with profuse
polyps (10 or more), whereas mutations in other regions of the APC gene
were associated with sparse polyps (fewer than 10).

In an analysis of 150 unrelated patients with familial adenomatous
polyposis, Nagase et al. (1992) found no indication that extracolonic
manifestations, such as osteomas and desmoid tumors, correlated with the
type or intragenic location of a particular germline mutation.

Olschwang et al. (1993) found that the extent of congenital hypertrophy
of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE) correlated with the position
of the protein-truncating mutation in APC. CHRPE lesions were almost
always absent if the mutation occurred before exon 9, but were
consistently present if it occurred after this exon. The same finding
was recorded by Bunyan et al. (1995), who also noted that a more distal
mutation site was associated with an earlier age of onset of symptoms
and a larger number of colonic polyps.

Caspari et al. (1994) and Gayther et al. (1994) found that patients with
the 5-bp deletion at codon 1309 (611731.0023) had gastrointestinal
symptoms and death from colorectal cancer that occurred about 10 years
earlier than in patients with other mutations.

Spirio et al. (1993) and Olschwang et al. (1993) found that the patients
with mutations in codons 136 to 302 of the APC gene did not develop
CHRPE, whereas those with mutations in a region beyond exon 9 and up to
codon 1387 of the gene presented with ophthalmic lesions. Only some
patients with mutations within exon 9 had CHRPE. Among 26 FAP patients,
including 18 with CHRPE, Wallis et al. (1994) reported a clear
association between CHRPE and APC mutations located at or after codon
457 in exon 9. Patients without CHRPE all had mutations proximal to exon
9. All 26 APC mutations resulted in truncated proteins, but the
mutations associated with CHRPE predicted truncated proteins larger than
50 kD. Wallis et al. (1994) suggested that larger mutant APC proteins
may exert a dominant-negative effect, resulting in decreased APC
function and expression of CHRPE.

Among 36 patients from 20 FAP families, Caspari et al. (1995) found that
patients with a mutation between codons 1445 and 1578 did not express
CHRPE, but developed severe desmoid tumors. With the exception of 3
prepubertal children, all patients with mutations in this region
developed desmoid tumors.

Davies et al. (1995) found that families with mutations 3-prime of codon
1444 had significantly more lesions on dental panoramic radiographs (p
less than 0.001) and appeared to have a higher incidence of desmoid
tumors than did families with mutations at the 5-prime end. All 7
families except one with mutations 5-prime of exon 9 did not express
CHRPE. All of 38 individuals from 16 families with mutations between
exon 9 and codon 1444 expressed CHRPE. The 11 individuals from 4
families with mutations 3-prime of codon 1444 did not express CHRPE.
These results suggested that the severity of some of the features of
Gardner syndrome may correlate with genotype in FAP.

Giardiello et al. (1997) studied 51 families in the Johns Hopkins
Polyposis Registry and detected germline APC mutations in 42. APC
mutation was associated with the extraintestinal phenotype. Mutations in
codons 542-1309 were associated with pigmented retinal lesions, while
mutations in codons 1465, 1546, and 2621 were associated with multiple
extraintestinal manifestations. Patients without extraintestinal
manifestations had either nontruncating APC mutations or had no
detectable APC mutations.

Brensinger et al. (1998) examined the colorectal and extracolonic
phenotypes in 2 FAP families from the Johns Hopkins Polyposis Registry;
1 family from the Indiana University Medical Center, Indianapolis,
Indiana; and 1 from the University of Colorado Cancer Center, Denver,
Colorado with mutations in the 3-prime end of the APC gene. The authors
found considerable intra- and interfamilial variability in colorectal
phenotype. Extracolonic manifestations also showed intra- and
interfamilial variation and did not correlate with colorectal phenotypic
expression: many of the individuals with an attenuated colorectal
phenotype had numerous skin lesions. No clear genotype-phenotype
correlation emerged from this study.

Wallis et al. (1999) studied genotype/phenotype correlations for 9
extracolonic manifestations associated with FAP. A significantly greater
proportion of individuals with mutations between codons 1395 and 1493
(group C3) exhibited osteomas, desmoids, and epidermoid cysts as
compared to those with mutations between codons 177 and 452 (group C1).
In addition, a significantly greater proportion of group C3 patients
presented with symptomatic desmoid tumors and osteomas as compared to
those with mutations between codons 457 and 1309 (group C2). Patients in
group C3 also exhibited the highest frequency of periampullary cancer
and gastric and duodenal adenomas. Although the incidence of
hepatoblastoma was too low to allow statistical analysis, Wallis et al.
(1999) noted that hepatoblastoma-associated APC mutations clustered
within the group C2 mutation region. Wallis et al. (1999) suggested that
liver imaging may be indicated in families with mutations in this
region.

Among 105 FAP patients with known pathogenic APC mutations, Bisgaard and
Bulow (2006) found that 17 reported palpable osteomas. Osteomas were
only identified in patients with mutations between codons 767 and 1513,
a gene area also associated with CHRPE and hepatoblastoma. Sebaceous
cysts were reported in 51% of 173 FAP patients, and those patients had
APC mutations evenly distributed in the gene with no particular
hotspots. Osteomas appeared most frequently in patients with sebaceous
cysts (odds ratio of 6.6).

- Attenuated APC

Spirio et al. (1993) determined the APC mutations in 7 families with
so-called 'attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli' (AAPC), i.e., FAP with
relatively few colonic polyps but still a significant risk of colon
cancer. Four distinct mutations in the APC gene were identified in 7
AAPC families (see, e.g., Y157X, 611731.0021). These mutations predicted
truncation products, similar to those identified in classic APC.
However, 4 mutated sites in AAPC were located very close to one another
and closer to the 5-prime end of the APC gene than mutations previously
discovered in patients with classic APC.

Friedl et al. (1996) reported a large family with attenuated FAP with a
frameshift mutation at codon 1597, which is beyond the beta-cadherin
binding site. The findings suggested a 5-prime border for the occurrence
of a second region of attenuated FAP that is located in the 3-prime part
of the APC gene. The authors proposed that a sufficient amount of
functional APC protein was available due to the absence of a
dominant-negative effect.

In a large Dutch family with attenuated FAP, van der Luijt et al. (1996)
identified a truncating mutation in the 3-prime region of the APC gene
(exon 15) (611731.0028). No truncated polypeptides were detected in
patient cells. Van der Luijt et al. (1996) speculated that 3-prime
mutations may be null alleles and that the attenuated phenotype is the
result of a haploinsufficiency of the normal APC protein and absence of
a truncated protein that could lead to a dominant-negative effect.

Spirio et al. (1998) suggested that specific APC alleles may be able to
modulate somatic APC chromosomal stability, including LOH. In 64
adenomas and 2 carcinomas from 8 patients with attenuated APC, there was
a decreased LOH of the APC allele compared to tumors of patients with
classic APC. In fact, no loss of the inherited normal APC allele was
observed, although sequencing showed that the inherited normal APC
allele had frequently undergone somatic point mutations and small
deletions in the tumors. These findings supported the suggestion that
attenuated APC alleles have residual gene activity and that this
activity modulates the spectrum and frequency of downstream mutations
that lead to adenoma formation.

In affected individuals from 7 of 11 AAPC kindreds, Soravia et al.
(1998) identified 5 novel germline APC mutations. The mutations were
located in 3 different regions of the APC gene: (1) at the 5-prime end
spanning exons 4 and 5, (2) within exon 9, and (3) at the 3-prime distal
end of the gene. Patients with mutations at the 5-prime end of the gene
tended to have more severe upper-gastrointestinal manifestations and a
higher number of polyps compared to the other groups. All AAPC kindreds
showed a predominance of right-sided colorectal adenomas and rectal
polyp sparing. No desmoid tumors were found in these kindreds.

Su et al. (2000) investigated the mechanism for attenuated APC in
patients carrying a mutant APC allele with a mutation in the
alternatively spliced region of exon 9, designated APC-AS9. The APC-AS9
allele was found to downregulate beta-catenin-regulated transcription,
the major tumor-suppressor function of APC, as did the wildtype APC.
Mutation analysis showed that both APC-AS9 and the wildtype APC alleles
were somatically mutated in most colorectal tumors from these patients.
Functional analysis showed that a common somatic mutation in APC-AS9 in
these tumors did not inactivate the wildtype APC. The results indicated
that carriers of APC-AS9 develop fewer colorectal tumors than do typical
patients with FAP because somatic inactivation of both APC alleles is
necessary for colorectal tumorigenesis. However, these patients do
develop colorectal tumors more frequently than does the general
population because APC-AS9 is inactivated by mutations that do not
inactivate the wildtype APC.

A further group of individuals, so-called 'multiple' adenoma patients,
have a phenotype like AAPC, with 3 to 99 polyps throughout the
colorectum, but most have no demonstrable germline APC mutations.
Routine mutation detection techniques failed to detect a pathogenic APC
germline mutation in approximately 30% of patients with classic
polyposis and 90% of those with AAPC/multiple adenomas. Sieber et al.
(2002) developed a real-time quantitative multiplex PCR assay to detect
APC exon 14 deletions. When this technique was applied to a set of 60
classic polyposis and 143 AAPC/multiple adenoma patients with no
apparent APC germline mutation, deletions were found exclusively in
individuals with classic polyposis (7 of 60, 12%). Fine mapping of the
region suggested that most (6 of 7) of these deletions encompassed the
entire APC locus, confirming that haploinsufficiency can result in a
classic polyposis phenotype.

The 3-prime 6.5 kb of the APC open reading frame is encoded by a single
exon, exon 15. Su et al. (2002) characterized 2 germline APC alterations
that deleted the entire APC exon 15 as a result of 56-kb (611731.0049)
and 73-kb (611731.0050) deletions at the APC locus. A surprising finding
was that the latter mutation resulted in a typical FAP phenotype,
whereas the former resulted in a phenotype consistent with attenuated
FAP.

Goss et al. (2002) demonstrated that attenuated APC alleles with 5-prime
mutations produce APC protein that downregulates beta-catenin, inhibits
beta-catenin/T-cell factor-mediated transactivation, and induces
cell-cycle arrest. Transfection studies demonstrated that translation
was initiated internally at an AUG at codon 184. Furthermore, APC coding
sequence between AAPC mutations and AUG-184 permitted internal ribosome
entry in a bicistronic vector. These data suggested that AAPC alleles in
vivo may produce functional APC by internal initiation. In addition, the
amino terminus of APC, which includes a homodimerization domain and
nuclear export signal, may not be critical for APC tumor-suppressor
function.

During APC mutation screening in 1,248 unrelated FAP patients, Aretz et
al. (2007) identified 75 cases with an assumed or confirmed de novo
mutation, and in 8 (11%) of the de novo cases, they confirmed the
presence of somatic mosaicism. In leukocyte DNA, the percentage of
mosaicism varied between 5.5% and 77%, whereas the proportion of the
mutation in tumor DNA from the respective patients was consistently
higher. Six of the 8 patients had an attenuated or atypical polyposis
phenotype that differed from the expected phenotype given the site of
the mutation. Aretz et al. (2007) concluded that some of the deviations
from the expected phenotype in FAP could be explained by the presence of
somatic mosaicism.

ANIMAL MODEL

- Animal Models of Disease

Lander (1991) used his microsatellite map to locate the mouse 'multiple
intestinal neoplasia' (Min) gene to mouse chromosome 18, which shows
homology of synteny to human chromosome 5. The findings suggested that
Min corresponds to APC in the human. Su et al. (1992) showed
specifically that the murine homolog of the APC gene (Apc) is tightly
linked to the phenotypically defined Min locus. In the Min mouse, the
authors identified a nonsense mutation in the Apc gene: a 2549T-A
transversion, resulting in a leu850-to-ter (L850X) substitution. Luongo
et al. (1993) showed that Min maps to proximal mouse chromosome 18.
Thus, Apc and Mcc are syntenic in both mouse and human, although the
gene order in the interval between the 2 genes is different between the
2 species.

Fodde et al. (1994) found that mice heterozygous for a truncating Apc
gene mutation progressively developed intestinal tumors in a manner
similar to that observed in patients with FAP and in mice carrying the
Min mutation. Moser et al. (1993) showed that female mice carrying the
Min mutation were also prone to develop mammary tumors. Min/+ mammary
glands were more sensitive to chemical carcinogenesis than are +/+
mammary glands. Transplantation of mammary cells from Min/+ or +/+
donors into +/+ hosts demonstrated that the propensity to develop
mammary tumors was intrinsic to the Min/+ mammary cells.

Dietrich et al. (1993) reported the genetic mapping of a locus that
strongly modified tumor number in Min/+ animals. This gene, Mom1
('modifier of Min1'; 172411), mapped to distal chromosome 4 and
controlled about 50% of genetic variation in tumor number in 2
intraspecific backcrosses. It was found to lie in the region of synteny
conservation with human chromosome 1p36-p35, a region of frequent
somatic loss of heterozygosity in a variety of human tumors, including
colon tumors.

Using homologous recombination of Apc in embryonic stem cells to
generate mice with a truncated Apc protein, Oshima et al. (1995) found
that most homozygous mice died in utero before day 8 of gestation.
Heterozygous mice developed multiple polyps throughout the intestinal
tract, mostly in the small intestine. The earliest polyps arose
multifocally during the third week after birth, and new polyps continued
to appear thereafter. Surprisingly, every nascent polyp consisted of a
microadenoma covered with a layer of normal villous epithelium. These
microadenomas originated from single crypts by forming abnormal
outpockets into the inner lacteal side of the neighboring villi.
Genotyping showed that all microadenomas had lost the wildtype Apc
allele, whereas the mutant allele remained unchanged. These results
indicated that loss of heterozygosity followed by formation of
intravillous microadenomas was responsible for polyposis in the
intestinal mucosa. A dominant-negative mechanism was considered
unlikely.

In the Min mouse, Wasan et al. (1997) observed a small but general
increase in tumor counts in both the large and the small bowel with
higher dietary fat. Increasing dietary fat also increased polyp size in
the small bowel. These changes appeared independent of total calorific
intake as assessed by body weights. Halving the crude fiber intake
together with an increase in dietary fat from 3% to 10% did not have as
marked an effect on tumor counts as did an increase of fat alone to 15%,
which also decreased survival.

Takaku et al. (1998) inactivated the mouse Dpc4 gene (SMAD4; 600993).
The homozygous mutants were embryonic lethal, whereas the heterozygotes
showed no abnormality. These investigators then introduced the Dpc4
mutation into the knockout mice for the mouse Apc-delta716 gene. Because
both Apc and Dpc4 are located on mouse chromosome 18, they constructed
compound heterozygotes carrying both mutations on the same chromosome by
meiotic recombination. In such mice, intestinal polyps developed into
more malignant tumors than those in the simple Apc-delta716
heterozygotes, showing an extensive stromal cell proliferation,
submucosal invasion, cell type heterogeneity, and in vivo
transplantability. Takaku et al. (1998) suggested that mutations in DPC4
(SMAD4) play a significant role in the malignant progression of
colorectal tumors.

Fodde et al. (2001) found that mouse embryonic stem cells with a mutant
Apc gene showed extensive chromosome and spindle aberrations, suggesting
a role for APC in chromosome segregation. Consistent with this role,
wildtype APC accumulated at the kinetochore during mitosis. Mutant Apc
cells formed mitotic spindles with an abundance of microtubules that
inefficiently connected with kinetochores. This phenotype could be
recapitulated by the induced expression of a 253-amino acid
carboxy-terminal fragment of APC in microsatellite-unstable human
colorectal cancer cells. Fodde et al. (2001) concluded that loss of APC
sequences that lie C-terminal to the beta-catenin regulatory domain
contributes to chromosomal instability in colorectal cancer.

Kielman et al. (2002) investigated the effect of different mutations in
Apc on the differentiation potential of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.
They provided genetic and molecular evidence that the ability and
sensitivity of ES cells to differentiate into the 3 germ layers was
inhibited by increased doses of beta-catenin (116806) by specific Apc
mutations. These ranged from a severe differentiation blockade in Apc
alleles completely deficient in beta-catenin regulation to more specific
neuroectodermal, dorsal mesodermal, and endodermal defects in more
hypomorphic alleles. Accordingly, a targeted oncogenic mutation in
Ctnnb1 (Catnb) also affected the differential potential of ES cells.
Expression profiling of wildtype and Apc-mutated teratomas supported the
differentiation defects at the molecular level and pinpointed a large
number of downstream structural and regulating genes. Chimeric
experiments showed that the effect was cell-autonomous. The results
implied that constitutive activation of the Apc/beta-catenin signaling
pathway results in differentiation defects in tissue homeostasis, and
possibly underlies tumorigenesis in the colon and other self-renewing
tissues.

The mammalian homeobox transcription factor CDX2 (600297) has key roles
in intestinal development and differentiation. Heterozygous Cdx2 mice
develop 1 or 2 benign hamartomas in the proximal colon, whereas
heterozygous Apc(del716) mice develop numerous adenomatous polyps,
mostly in the small intestine. Aoki et al. (2003) showed that the
colonic polyp number is about 6 times higher in compound mutant mice
carrying both mutations in heterozygous state. Levels of both Apc and
Cdx2 were significantly lower in the distal colon, which caused high
anaphase bridge index (ABI) associated with a higher frequency of loss
of heterozygosity at Apc. In cultured rat intestinal epithelial and
human colon cancer cell lines, suppression of Cdx2 by antisense RNA
caused marked increases in ABI and chromosomal aberrations. This was
mediated by stimulation of the mTOR (601231) pathway, causing
translational deregulation and G1-S acceleration. Similar results were
obtained in the mice with compound heterozygosity for the Apc deletion
and the Cdx knockout. Forced activation of mTOR through the upstream
regulator Akt1 (164730) also increased ABI in colon cancer cells. High
ABI in all cell lines was suppressed by mTOR inhibitors. These results
suggested that reduced expression of CDX2 is important in colon
tumorigenesis through mTOR-mediated chromosomal instability.

Functional loss of APC has been shown or proposed to have several
different mechanisms: mutation in APC, nondisjunction, homologous
somatic recombination, and epigenetic silencing. In the C57BL/6 (B6)
Apc(Min/+) mouse model of inherited intestinal cancer, loss of Apc
function can occur by loss of heterozygosity through somatic
recombination between homologs. Haigis and Dove (2003) reported that the
Robertsonian translocation referred to as Rb9 suppressed the
multiplicity of intestinal adenomas in this mouse model. As the copy
number of Rb9 increased, the association with the interphase nucleolus
of the rDNA repeats centromeric to the Apc locus on mouse chromosome 18
was increasingly disrupted. Their analysis showed that homologous
somatic recombination is the principal pathway for LOH in adenomas in B6
Apc(Min/+) mice. These studies provided additional evidence that
neoplastic growth can initiate in the complete absence of canonic
genomic instability. Rb9 was originally identified in a wild mouse
caught in the Orobian Alps near Bergamo in northern Italy. It consists
of a centric fusion between mouse chromosomes 7 and 18. In addition to
reduced fertility owing to meiotic nondisjunction, the chromosomes
involved in a Robertsonian translocation show suppressed meiotic
recombination when heterozygous. The suppression of recombination is
thought to result from mispairing of trivalents during pachytene.

Tischfield and Shao (2003) pointed to the work of Haigis and Dove (2003)
as indicating that somatic recombination rather than chromosome loss
associated with genetic instability is the primary cause of adenoma
formation in the mouse model. The authors showed that a Robertsonian
translocation, which seemingly interferes with the colocalization of
chromosome homologs in interphase nucleus, suppresses recombination and
subsequent adenoma formation in the mutant mice. Karyotypically normal
B6 mice heterozygous for the Min mutation of the Apc gene have intact
nucleolar organizing regions (NORs) near the centromeres of chromosome
18 homologs, facilitating nucleolar colocalization and the homologous
recombination that produces loss of a normal Apc allele and a high
incidence of intestinal adenomas. Apc(Min+) mice lack an NOR on the 7.18
translocation chromosome, resulting in a failure of nucleolar
colocalization of homologs, suppression of homologous recombination, and
far fewer intestinal adenomas.

Hurlstone et al. (2003) found that Apc mutant zebrafish completed
gastrulation, but their hearts failed to loop and formed excessive
endocardial cushions. Conversely, overexpression of Apc or Dickkopf-1
(DKK1; 605189), a secreted Wnt inhibitor, blocked cushion formation. In
wildtype hearts, nuclear beta-catenin accumulated only in valve-forming
cells, where it could activate a Tcf reporter. In mutant hearts, all
cells displayed nuclear beta-catenin and Tcf reporter activities, while
valve markers were markedly upregulated. Concomitantly, proliferation
and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, normally restricted to
endocardial cushions, occurred throughout the endocardium. Hurlstone et
al. (2003) concluded that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling may play a role in
determining endocardial cell fate. Apc mutant zebrafish carried a
premature termination codon corresponding to amino acid 1318 of human
APC, an allele designated apc(mcr). Heterozygous mutant zebrafish
developed normally. Homozygous mutant zebrafish embryos died between 72
and 96 hours postfertilization and displayed multiple defects including
cardiac malformations, enlarged otic vesicles, smaller eyes, and body
curvature. Further, jaw, pharynx, and inner-ear structures failed to
develop and fin buds arrested. Primordia for internal organs such as
gut, liver, and pancreas formed but developed abnormally. Hurlstone et
al. (2003) suggested that mutant embryos probably develop beyond
gastrulation owing to the presence of maternal Apc.

Rao et al. (2005) found that mice haploinsufficient for both Bub1b
(602860) and Apc developed 10 times more colonic tumors than mice
deficient in Apc alone, and the tumors were of higher grades. Compound
mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) contained more beta-catenin
and proliferated at a faster rate than wildtype or Bub1b +/- MEFs.
Compound mutant MEFs also slipped through mitosis in the presence of
nocodazole and exhibited a higher rate of genomic instability than
wildtype, Bub1b +/-, or Apc +/- mice. Rao et al. (2005) concluded that
BUB1B and APC functionally interact in regulating metaphase-anaphase
transition, deregulation of which increases genomic instability and the
development and progression of colorectal cancer.

Nadauld et al. (2006) found that Apc mutant zebrafish had ocular
abnormalities similar to those in mice and humans with APC mutations.
Furthermore, they showed that Apc had a dual role in ocular
morphogenesis. APC regulation of canonical WNT/beta-catenin signaling
appeared active in the developing lens. In contrast, Apc controlled
retinoic acid production via Rdh5 in the retina and was required for
retinal differentiation.

Amos-Landgraf et al. (2007) established a nonsense mutation of the Apc
gene in an inbred rat strain and observed that Apc-mutant heterozygotes
developed multiple neoplasms with a distribution between the colon and
small intestine that closely simulated that found in human FAP patients.
Owing to the metacentric nature of the rat karyotype, the authors were
able to demonstrate that loss of the wildtype APC allele in tumors did
not involve chromosome loss. Amos-Landgraf et al. (2007) designated this
rat strain Pirc (polyposis in rat colon) and suggested that it could
address many of the gaps in modeling human colon cancer.

To elucidate the role of MYC (190080) in the intestine after APC loss,
Sansom et al. (2007) simultaneously deleted both Apc and Myc in the
adult murine small intestine. They showed that loss of Myc rescued the
phenotypes of perturbed differentiation, migration, proliferation, and
apoptosis, which occur on deletion of Apc. Remarkably, this rescue
occurred in the presence of high levels of nuclear beta-catenin. Array
analysis revealed that Myc is required for the majority of Wnt (see
164820) target gene activation following Apc loss. Sansom et al. (2007)
concluded that these data established MYC as the critical mediator of
the early stages of neoplasia following APC loss.

Shibata et al. (2007) generated several FAP mouse lines heterozygous for
a ser580-to-asp (S580D) truncation mutation in the Apc gene and found
that 1 line (line 19) showed reduced incidence of intestinal adenomas
(less than 5% compared with other lines). They identified a deletion in
the Ctnna1 gene (116805) as the cause of tumor suppression in line-19
Apc S580D/+ mice and found that suppression only occurred when the
Ctnna1 deletion was in cis configuration with the Apc S580D mutation. In
all adenomas generated in line-19 Apc S580D/+ mice, somatic
recombination between Apc and Ctnna1 retained the wildtype Ctnna1
allele. Shibata et al. (2007) concluded that simultaneous inactivation
of Ctnna1 and Apc during tumor initiation suppressed adenoma formation
in line-19 Apc S580D/+ mice, suggesting that CTNNA1 plays an essential
role in initiation of intestinal adenomas.

Lane et al. (2010) showed that young Apc(min) mice had normal
steady-state hematopoiesis. However, Apc(min) mice developed
myelodysplastic syndrome between 136 and 210 days of age, with increased
potential for spleen cells to form myeloid, granulocyte, and erythroid
colonies. Transplantation experiments revealed that Apc(min) bone marrow
had enhanced repopulation potential, suggesting intrinsic enhancement of
short- and long-term hematopoietic stem cell function. However, serial
transplantation experiments revealed impaired repopulation potential in
secondary recipients due to loss of the quiescent stem cell population
in Apc(min) bone marrow.

- Therapeutic Strategies

Westbrook et al. (1994) explored the potential for gene therapy by
studying the transient expression of the APC gene in normal rat colonic
epithelium, using liposomal gene delivery by rectal catheter infusion.
Expression of a beta-galactosidase reporter gene and of the human APC
gene under a constitutive promoter was demonstrated. Close to 100% of
epithelial cells expressed the introduced gene. Expression was transient
and did not persist beyond 4 days, consistent with the normal turnover
time of gut epithelium, but it could be maintained by repeated
treatments. Human APC was expressed for 3 weeks under these conditions
at approximately one-tenth the level of the endogenous APC gene, and no
toxicity was observed beyond that attributed to repeated rectal enemas.

Tsujii and DuBois (1995) showed that overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2
(COX2; 600262) in rat intestinal epithelial cells resulted in increased
adhesion to extracellular matrix and resistance to butyrate-induced
apoptosis. These phenotypic changes that might enhance tumorigenic
potential were reversed by sulindac sulfide, a COX inhibitor.

Mahmoud et al. (1997) found that heterozygous Min -/+ mice with an Apc
mutation resulting in a truncated Apc protein had changes in the growth
characteristics of preneoplastic tissue, including decreased apoptosis
and proliferation and decreased enterocyte migration. These findings
suggested a dominant-negative effect. The mutation was also associated
with changes in beta-catenin expression. These effects were reversed
with the chemopreventive drug sulindac sulfide. However, Mahmoud et al.
(1999) found no difference in enterocyte migration, proliferation,
apoptosis, or beta-catenin levels in another group of mutant Apc mice
with no Apc protein expression compared to wildtype littermates bearing
2 normal Apc alleles. Furthermore, administration of sulindac sulfide to
Apc1638N mice did not alter enterocyte migration. These observations
suggested that the dominant-negative effect altering cell migration was
exerted by the truncated Apc protein present in the first group of Min/+
mice.

Boolbol et al. (1996) found that histologically normal-appearing small
bowel from the Min mouse showed increased amounts of Cox2 and
prostaglandin E2 compared to +/+ littermates. Using 2 different in situ
techniques, terminal transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling and a
direct immunoperoxidase method, Min animals also demonstrated a 27%-47%
decrease in enterocyte apoptosis compared to +/+ animals. Treatment with
sulindac not only inhibited tumor formation but decreased small bowel
Cox2 and prostaglandin E2 to baseline and restored normal levels of
apoptosis.

Oshima et al. (1996) bred mice carrying an APC mutation with a mouse
with a disrupted Cox2 gene. All of the animals were heterozygous at the
Apc locus; if homozygous for wildtype COX2, they developed an average of
652 polyps at 10 weeks, while heterozygotes had 224 polyps and
homozygously deficient mice had only 93 polyps. The findings showed that
induction of Cox2 is an early, rate-limiting step for adenoma formation.
As supporting evidence, a drug that inhibited COX2 but not COX1 (176805)
also markedly reduced the number of polyps. Oshima et al. (1996) added
the Cox2 gene to the list of genes involved in colon neoplasia. The
findings suggested to Prescott and White (1996) that drugs that inhibit
COX2 should be broadly effective in chemoprevention of colon cancer.
Prescott and White (1996) reviewed the intimate connections between APC
and COX2.

Halberg et al. (2000) found that the multiplicity and invasiveness of
intestinal adenomas in Min mice was enhanced by deficiency of p53. In
addition, the occurrence of desmoid fibromas was strongly enhanced by
p53 deficiency. The genetic modifier Mom1 and the pharmacologic agents
piroxicam and difluoromethylornithine each reduced intestinal adenoma
multiplicity in the absence of p53 function. Mom1 showed no influence on
the development of desmoid fibromas, whereas the combination of
piroxicam and difluoromethylornithine exerted a moderate effect.

Lal et al. (2001) studied the effects of COX inhibitors on intestinal
adenomas and colonic aberrant crypt foci in the accelerated polyposis
mismatch-repair-deficient Min mouse model (Apc+/-Msh2-/-) as well as in
the standard Min mouse model. The mice with knockout of the Msh2 gene
(609309) have genetic features of both familial adenomatous polyposis
and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, and rapidly develop
numerous small- and large-bowel adenomas, as well as colonic aberrant
crypt foci. Lal et al. (2001) found that a specific COX2 inhibitor was
effective in preventing small-bowel polyps in mismatch-repair-deficient
Min mice and both small- and large-bowel polyps in standard Min mice.

FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 1
APC, 2-BP DEL, EX7

In a patient with familial adenomatous polyposis coli-1 (FAP1; 175100),
Groden et al. (1991) identified a heterozygous 2-bp deletion at exon 7
of the APC gene at positions 730 and 731 in the cDNA sequence reported
by Joslyn et al. (1991). This changed the normal sequence at the splice
junction from CAGAGGTCA, of which the first CAG is an intronic sequence,
to CAGGTCA. Groden et al. (1991) noted that although this deletion is
within the 5-prime splice site, known consensus sequences suggest that
the splice site may still be maintained. The deletion would therefore
result in a frameshift and premature stop codon. Studies of both parents
showed that the mutation in the proband was de novo; however, it had
been transmitted to 2 of his 3 children.

APC, ARG302TER

In 2 unrelated patients, a 46-year-old with FAP1 (175100) and a
27-year-old with Gardner syndrome manifest as polyposis with a desmoid
tumor, Nishisho et al. (1991) identified a C-to-T transition in the APC
gene, resulting in an arg302-to-ter (R302X) substitution. There was
cosegregation of the mutation with the disease phenotype in multiple
members of the FAP kindred. The findings suggested that the specific
mutation does not completely specify the extracolonic manifestations of
FAP, and that the phenotype is likely to be the result of other genetic
or environmental influences.

Chung et al. (2006) identified a de novo R302X mutation in a 19-year-old
woman with Gardner syndrome (see 175100) manifest as the
cribriform-morular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma, which had
been discovered 8 months before the discovery of polyposis of the colon.

In 2 apparently unrelated Dutch patients with FAP1 (175100), Fodde et
al. (1992) identified a 4-bp deletion (ATAG) in codons 169-171 of the
APC gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The
wildtype sequence suggested the presence of a head-to-tail duplication
of a tetranucleotide which offered a suitable substrate for unequal but
homologous crossover events leading to either triplication or deletion
of the 4-bp unit. Haplotype analysis performed with intragenic and
flanking polymorphic markers indicated that the 2 identical 4-bp
deletions were located on different chromosomes, suggesting that they
had arisen independently.

APC, 2-BP DEL, CODON 1465

In tumor tissue from a periampullary adenoma from a patient with FAP
(175100), Bapat et al. (1993) identified a somatic 2-bp deletion (AG) at
codon 1465 of the APC gene. The patient had a germline APC mutation
(611731.0023).

Martin-Denavit et al. (2001) described the 1465delAG mutation in 2
unrelated families with Gardner syndrome who showed interfamilial
phenotypic heterogeneity. The mutation was identified by a simple
nonradioactive method using a heteroduplex analysis and specifically
characterized by sequence analysis. In both families, fibromatosis was
noted before polyposis, leading to the diagnosis of Gardner syndrome. In
the first family, progression of fibromas and osteomas was much greater,
and colonic polyposis was sparser, compared to the second family.
Prognosis was mainly based on the dramatic evolution of the desmoid
tumors before the age of 30. In contrast, desmoid manifestations
remained discrete in family 2, and the prognosis was dependent on the
development of colon cancer. The wide inter- and intrafamilial
variability of the phenotype suggested the operation of one or more
modifier genes. Since a 'second hit' is thought to be necessary for the
development of desmoid tumors, this may account for a difference between
and even within families; a modifier locus may have favored a 'second
hit' in mesenchymal cells in family 1, and in colonic epithelial cells
in family 2.

FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 1, ATTENUATED
APC, TRP157TER

In 1 of 7 families with what Spirio et al. (1993) referred to as an
'attenuated' form of familial polyposis (see 175100), the authors
identified a 470G-A transition in exon 4 of the APC gene, resulting in a
trp157-to-ter (W157X) substitution, predicted to generate a truncated
product of 156 amino acids. This mutation was present in all affected
family members, as well as in 3 asymptomatic individuals. Notably, one
of the latter had reached the age of 41 without developing any
clinically detectable adenomatous polyps. This mutation and 3 others
detected in other atypical families were located very close to one
another and nearer the 5-prime end of the APC gene than any base
substitution or small deletion previously discovered in patients with
classic APC.

ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS COLI WITH CONGENITAL CHOLESTEATOMA, INCLUDED
APC, 5-BP DEL, CODON 1309

In 9 patients with severe FAP1 (175100), Gayther et al. (1994)
identified a 5-bp deletion at codon 1309 of the APC gene. The 5-bp
deletion extends from the last base of codon 1309 to the first base of
codon 1311; some refer to it as the 'codon 1309' APC mutation. This
mutation may account for 9% of FAP due to mutations in the APC gene. The
mutation tends to be associated with more severe and earlier onset
disease and the presence of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal
pigmented epithelium (CHRPE).

Bapat et al. (1993) identified a 5-bp deletion at codon 1309 in an FAP
patient with periampullary adenomas. Two different somatic mutations in
the APC gene (611731.0019; 611731.0020) were identified in 2 distinct
adenomas from this patient.

Distante et al. (1996) described a 5-year-old girl with the mutation who
presented with rectal bleeding from extensive polyposis of the colon;
her father had had a colectomy for FAP at the age 23.

Shaoul et al. (1999) described a 6-year-old boy with FAP and congenital
cholesteatoma (see 604183). They suggested that cholesteatoma represents
a tumor-like lesion with biologic characteristics resembling other
alimentary lesions of FAP. The patient first came to medical attention
at the age of 4 years because of intermittent painless hematochezia.
Colonoscopy at the age of 6 years showed multiple polyps of the colon.
Eye examination showed hyperpigmented retinal lesions in the temporal
retina of each eye, but radiographic studies of the mandible and maxilla
showed no changes. The cholesteatoma was detected at the age of 4 years
because of unilateral conductive hearing loss. Polyps had been detected
in the patient's mother at the age of 25 years and a subtotal colectomy
was performed. In both the mother and the child, DNA analysis identified
a 5-bp deletion (GAAAG) at codons 1309-1311 in exon 15 of the APC gene.
Shaoul et al. (1999) commented that mutations at codon 1309 have been
associated with early development of adenomatous polyps and a greater
risk of malignancies at an early age. Furthermore, the same mutations
are strongly associated with the presence of congenital hypertrophy of
the retinal pigment epithelium.

APC, SER1395CYS

In tumor tissue isolated from hepatoblastoma (see 114550) of 3 unrelated
affected Japanese boys, Oda et al. (1996) identified an A-to-T
transition in the APC gene, resulting in a ser1395-to-cys (S1395C)
substitution. Oda et al. (1996) noted that hepatoblastoma is an
extracolonic feature of FAP (175100).

DESMOID DISEASE, HEREDITARY
APC, 2-BP INS, CODON 1924

In affected members of a family with hereditary desmoid disease
(135290), Eccles et al. (1996) identified a 2-bp insertion (AA) in codon
1924 of the APC gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature protein
termination. The mutation occurred in the 3-prime end of exon 15.

.0026
DESMOID DISEASE, HEREDITARY
APC, 4-BP DEL, NT5844

Scott et al. (1996) identified a germline APC mutation in the original
kindred with hereditary desmoid disease (135290) described by Maher et
al. (1992). Direct sequencing of genomic DNA revealed a 4-bp deletion at
nucleotides 5844-5847 (codon 1962) of the APC sequence. The same
mutation occurred in 2 other apparently unrelated families with desmoid
tumors. Haplotype analysis suggested a common origin for the APC
mutation in the 3 families.

.0027
FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 1
APC, 1-BP DEL, EX15

In affected members of a large family with FAP1 (175100), Scott et al.
(1995) identified a 1-bp deletion (5960delA) in codon 1987 of the APC
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination 61 codons
downstream. The mutation was in the 3-prime end of exon 15 in the
3-prime region of the APC gene. Affected family members showed a highly
variable phenotype, with both severe disease with extracolonic
manifestations and mild disease.

Van der Luijt et al. (1996) did not detect a truncated APC protein in
cells from the family reported by Scott et al. (1995).

.0028
FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 1, ATTENUATED
APC, 4-BP DEL, EX15

In a large Dutch family with attenuated FAP1 (see 175100), van der Luijt
et al. (1996) identified a 4-bp (TTCT) deletion at codons 1860 to 1862
of the APC gene, resulting in a frameshift and an immediate stop codon.
The deletion occurred in the 3-prime part of exon 15 and did not result
in a stable truncated protein; only the wildtype APC protein was
detected in an affected individual. The phenotype in this family showed
marked variability in number of polyps (ranging from 0 to more than 100)
and relatively late age at cancer onset (mean 56 years). None of the
patients had desmoid tumors. Van der Luijt et al. (1996) hypothesized
that the milder phenotype in this family was due to haploinsufficiency
of a normal APC protein and absence of a truncated APC protein with a
possible dominant-negative effect.

.0029
FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 1, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
BREAST CANCER, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
APC, ILE1307LYS

In a 39-year-old Ashkenazi Jewish man with colorectal adenomas and a
family history of colon cancer (175100), Laken et al. (1997) identified
a 3920T-A transversion in the APC gene, resulting in an ile1307-to-lys
(I1307K) substitution. An in vitro synthesized protein assay from this
allele showed a truncated APC protein. The T-to-A change converted an
AAATAAAA sequence to (A)8 and was postulated to result in failure of the
cellular transcriptional or translational machinery, resulting in a
truncated protein. The (A)8 tract not only was unstable in vivo, leading
to somatic mutation, but also appeared to be unstable in vitro during
the enzymatic manipulations employed in the IVSP assay. The same
mutation was identified in 28% of Ashkenazi Jews with a family history
of CRC and in the carrier state of 6% unaffected Ashkenazim from the
general population. Analysis of tumor tissue occurring in CRC patients
with the I1307K mutation revealed that nearly half contained somatic
truncating mutations closely surrounding the germline mutation; all the
somatic mutations occurred exclusively in the I1307K allele. Laken et
al. (1997) concluded that presence of the I1307K mutation results in a
2-fold increased risk for colorectal cancer, although the change in
itself does not likely contribute to the disease.

Petersen et al. (1998) addressed the increasingly important problem of
interpreting the significance of missense mutations found in
disease-causing genes, citing the APC I1307K mutation as a case in
point. Using a Bayesian approach that incorporated genetic information
on affected relatives, relationship of the relatives to the proband, the
population frequency of the mutation, and the phenocopy rate of the
disease, the authors concluded that the I1307K mutation was likely to be
disease causing. Petersen et al. (1998) also developed a simple
approximation for rare alleles and considered the case of unknown
penetrance and allele frequency.

By genotyping 5,081 Ashkenazi volunteers in a community survey, Woodage
et al. (1998) concluded that APC I1307K carriers have a modestly
elevated risk of developing cancer (less than 2-fold). Woodage et al.
(1998) emphasized that the large majority of I1307K carriers would not
develop cancer of the colon or breast, and that only a small proportion
of Jewish individuals who develop these cancers will be carriers.
Redston et al. (1998) identified a heterozygous I1307K polymorphism in
66 (10.4%) of 632 unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish women with primary invasive
breast cancer (113705). This proportion was significantly greater than
the 7.03% carrier frequency observed in the study by Woodage et al.
(1998). However, prevalence data suggested that the effect of the I1307K
allele on breast cancer risk was largely or entirely limited to those
with BRCA (see, e.g., BRCA1, 113705) founder mutations. Redston et al.
(1998) concluded that the I1307K polymorphism emerges as a candidate
low-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility allele or a genetic modifier
of risk in BRCA heterozygotes.

Frayling et al. (1998) identified the I1307K allele in 3 patients of
Ashkenazi Jewish descent with multiple colorectal adenomas and/or
carcinoma.

Yuan et al. (1998) described a French-Canadian kindred in which HNPCC
was related to a novel truncating mutation in the MLH1 gene
(120436.0009). In the same family, they found the I1307K APC
polymorphism, which had previously been identified only in individuals
of self-reported Ashkenazi Jewish origin. However, there appeared to be
no relationship between the I1307K polymorphism and the presence or
absence of cancer in the French-Canadian family.

Gryfe et al. (1999) identified the APC I1307K allele in 48 (10.1%) of
476 Ashkenazi Jewish subjects with adenomatous polyps and/or colorectal
cancer. Compared with the frequency of 2 separate population control
groups, the APC I1307K allele was associated with an estimated relative
risk of 1.5 to 1.7 for colorectal neoplasia (P equal to 0.01). Compared
with noncarriers, APC I1307K carriers had increased numbers of adenomas
and colorectal cancers per patient, as well as a younger age at
diagnosis. Gryfe et al. (1999) estimated that the APC I1307K
polymorphism directly contributes to 3 to 4% of all Ashkenazi Jewish
colorectal cancer.

In persons at average risk for colorectal cancer, Rozen et al. (1999)
identified the APC I1307K variant in 5.0% of 120 European and 1.6% of
188 non-European Jews (P = 0.08). It occurred in 15.4% of 52 Ashkenazi
Israelis with familial cancer (P = 0.02), and was not detected in 51
non-European Jews at increased cancer risk. Colorectal neoplasia
occurred individually or in the families of 13 of 20 Ashkenazi I1307K
carriers, 8 of whom also had a personal or family history of noncolonic
neoplasia.

Prior et al. (1999) did not identify the I1307K mutation among 345
non-Ashkenazim individuals with colorectal cancer, suggesting that it is
restricted to that population. Somatic mutations occurred at a lower
frequency and were more randomly distributed when the I1307K allele was
not present.

In an editorial, Gruber et al. (1999) compared the group of Prior et al.
(1999) to investigators at the scene of an accident. Prior et al. (1999)
carefully characterized the somatic mutations associated with the I1307K
polymorphism as if they were crash sites near this hypermutability oil
slick. Tumors with the wildtype allele at codon 1307 had a variety of
somatic mutations that were distributed randomly in the APC gene and
were not tightly clustered around the 1307 codon. These results
contrasted sharply with previous crash site investigations of the mutant
allele which showed characteristic mutations piling up like cars around
the oil slick. This earlier work by the Vogelstein group (Laken et al.,
1997), confirmed by Gryfe et al. (1998), showed that mutations arising
in association with the mutant allele appeared to be localized to a
29-bp region around the gene and were almost always insertions.
Furthermore, these unusual somatic mutations were restricted to the
mutant allele, never occurring in the wildtype allele in the same
patients. The reference to 'crash sites' and 'oil slick' provided useful
imagery comparable to the 'gatekeeper' and 'caretaker' roles of other
cancer-related genes--again products of the Vogelstein laboratory, as is
the designation 'landscaper,' envisioned as the basis of colorectal
cancer in juvenile polyposis.

Patael et al. (1999) found the I1307K polymorphism in 2 non-Ashkenazi
Jewish women in Israel and hypothesized that among Jewish persons it may
not be restricted to Ashkenazim, but may actually reflect a common
ancestral polymorphism. The haplotype pattern in these 2 women and in 9
Ashkenazi carrier controls was identical in all individuals regardless
of ethnic origin.

Lamlum et al. (2000) screened 164 unrelated patients with multiple
(3-100) colorectal adenomas for germline variants throughout the APC
gene, and found 3 Ashkenazi patients harboring the I1307K mutation.
Germline APC variants accounted for approximately 10% of all patients
with multiple adenomas. The authors recommended screening multiple
adenoma patients of Ashkenazi descent for the I1307K variant.

Silverberg et al. (2001) found no increased frequency of I1307K in
Ashkenazi Jewish patients with inflammatory bowel disease and concluded
that this mutation cannot account for the increased susceptibility to
colorectal cancer associated with inflammatory bowel disease.

Rozen et al. (2002) reported studies in Israel indicating that I1307K is
a low-penetrance variant with a 1.7 relative risk for neoplasia in
carriers who have familial carcinoma, clinically equivalent to obtaining
a family history of sporadic colorectal neoplasia and promoting early
screening. They concluded that I1307K is a founder variant in Jews of
different ethnic origin, mainly Ashkenazim, and it explains only
partially their higher incidence of colorectal carcinoma.

Lynch and de la Chapelle (2003) schematized the somatic mutations that
occur in carriers of the I1307K polymorphism, which results in a stretch
of 8 adenosines that is believed to increase the risk of somatic
mutations as a result of slippage during replication. Lynch and de la
Chapelle (2003) illustrated the types of somatic changes in colonic
tumors, e.g., an addition of 1 adenosine seen in the affected allele of
many carriers. The addition or loss of a nucleotide causes a frameshift
and loss of function of APC, constituting an important somatic event in
tumor initiation.

In individuals of Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Arab descent, Niell et al.
(2003) found a common progenitor haplotype spanning across APC I1037K
from the centromeric marker D5S135 to the telomeric marker D5S346. The
ancestor of modern I1307K alleles existed 87.9 to 118 generations ago
(approximately 2,200 to 2,950 years ago). This estimate indicated that
I1307K existed at about the time of the beginning of the Jewish
diaspora, explaining its presence in non-Ashkenazi populations. The data
did not indicate that selection operated at I1307K, providing compelling
evidence that the high frequency of disease-susceptibility alleles in
the Ashkenazim is due to genetic drift, not selection.

In affected members of a family with FAP1 (175100), Cama et al. (1994)
identified a 3-bp deletion in the APC gene: 2 adenine residues of codon
437 and the adjacent guanine residue at the consensus donor splicing
sequence of exon 9. The sequence of the 3-prime end of exon 9 was
converted from CCA A/gtat to CC/tat. The APC gene mutation abolished the
donor site of exon 9a, used in both alternatively spliced isoforms of
the exon. The phenotype was characterized by hundreds of colorectal
adenomas (320 to more than 500); a child in this family already had 460
adenomas at the age of 8 years. Analysis of the relative levels of
mutant and wildtype transcripts in unaffected colonic mucosa
demonstrated that the mutant allele was not expressed. In contrast, a
second kindred with a neighboring mutation (611731.0034) in exon 9 in
the portion of the exon that is alternatively spliced showed an
attenuated form of FAP characterized by a low number of colorectal
adenomas. The model suggested by these 2 kindreds suggested that the
type of mutation and transcript dosage effects contribute to the
heterogeneity of disease phenotypes in FAP.

FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 1, ATTENUATED
APC, 2-BP DEL

In a family with an attenuated form of FAP1 (see 175100) characterized
by a low number of colorectal adenomas (up to 22), Curia et al. (1998)
identified a 2-bp deletion within codon 367 of exon 9 of the APC gene.
This frameshift mutation was located in the portion of exon 9 that
undergoes alternative splicing and was predicted to introduce a
premature termination signal at codon 376 in the fraction of mature
transcripts containing the alternatively spliced form of exon 9. Thus,
splicing-out of the mutation site into a fraction of mRNA molecules was
predicted, with the residual production of wildtype transcripts from the
mutant APC alleles. Curia et al. (1998) contrasted this finding with
that in a neighboring exon 9 mutation (611731.0033) that led to deletion
of exon 9 and was associated with a severe FAP phenotype characterized
by hundreds of colorectal adenomas. They suggested that, in addition to
the mutation site, the type of mutation and transcript dosage effects
contribute to the heterogeneity of disease phenotypes in FAP.

.0035
FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 1, ATTENUATED
APC, 2-BP DEL

In a family with attenuated FAP of variable phenotype (see 175100),
Young et al. (1998) identified a 2-bp deletion in the alternatively
spliced region of exon 9 at codon 398, resulting in a frameshift and
stop signal 4 codons downstream. The clinical features ranged from
sparse right-sided polyposis and cancer in the proximal colon at the age
of 34 to pancolonic polyposis and cancer at the age of 68. Rectal
sparing was common to all affected members. Alternatively spliced
transcripts that deleted the mutation were readily amplified from normal
colonic mucosa, providing an explanation for the attenuated phenotype
seen in this family.

.0036
FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 1, ATTENUATED
APC, GLU1317GLN

In 4 patients with multiple colorectal adenomas and/or carcinomas (see
175100), Frayling et al. (1998) identified a 3949G-C transversion in
exon 15 of the APC gene, resulting in a glu1317-to-gln (E1317Q)
substitution. One of these individuals had an unusually large number of
metaplastic polyps of the colorectum. Although 2 patients had a remote
family history of colorectal cancer and 1 had a family history of
gastric cancer, none had a family history of colonic adenomas or classic
FAP.

Lamlum et al. (2000) identified the E1317Q variant in 7 of 164 unrelated
patients with multiple (3-100) colorectal adenomas. Among the entire
group, germline APC variants accounted for approximately 10% of patients
with multiple adenomas. The authors recommended screening multiple
adenoma patients for a restricted number of germline APC variants,
including E1317Q.

.0037
FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 1
APC, 1-BP DEL, 5960A

In a 57-year-old man with FAP1 (175100), Kartheuser et al. (1999)
identified a 1-bp deletion (5960delA) in the 3-prime end of exon 15 of
the APC gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The
patient had an unusual and complex phenotype with colorectal, gastric,
and periampullary adenomatous polyposis, as well as 3 bilateral
adrenocortical adenomas. His mother died of colon cancer at age 66.
Three of the patient's 4 asymptomatic children were also found to have
the mutation.

.0038
FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 1, ATTENUATED
APC, 2-BP DEL, 937GA

In a family with an attenuated form of adenomatous polyposis coli (see
175100) and thyroid cancer, Soravia et al. (1999) identified a germline
2-bp deletion (937delGA) in exon 9 of the APC gene, resulting in a
frameshift and a premature stop codon. The thyroid tumors showed a range
of morphologic features: some exhibited typical papillary architecture
and were associated with multifocal carcinoma; in others, there were
unusual areas of cribriform morphology, and spindle-cell components with
whorled architecture. RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 (see 164761) were expressed
in thyroid cancers.

.0039
GARDNER SYNDROME
APC, LEU698TER

In affected members of a family with Gardner syndrome (see 175100) and
thyroid cancer, Soravia et al. (1999) identified a heterozygous 2092T-G
transversion in exon 698 of the APC gene, resulting in a leu698-to-ter
(L698X) substitution. The thyroid tumors showed a range of morphologic
features: some exhibited typical papillary architecture and were
associated with multifocal carcinoma; in others, there were unusual
areas of cribriform morphology, and spindle-cell components with whorled
architecture. Affected members showed classic FAP associated, in
addition to thyroid carcinoma, with desmoid tumor, duodenal polyposis,
osteoma, dental abnormalities, and epidermoid cysts. RET/PTC1 and
RET/PTC3 (see 164761) were expressed in thyroid cancers.

.0040
DESMOID DISEASE, HEREDITARY
APC, 337-BP INS

In affected members of an Amish family with autosomal dominant
inheritance of desmoid tumors (135290), Halling et al. (1999) identified
a 337-bp insertion in an AluI sequence at codon 1526 of the APC gene,
resulting in protein truncation. The presence of a poly(A) tail at the
3-prime end of the insertion suggested that the AluI sequence was
inserted by a retrotranspositional event.

FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 1, ATTENUATED
APC, DEL

Pilarski et al. (1999) reported a 39-year-old man with attenuated FAP1
(see 175100) and a cytogenetically visible interstitial 5q deletion.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis with 2 cosmid probes
specific for the 5-prime and 3-prime ends of the APC gene indicated that
the entire locus was deleted. The number of polyps (50-60) seen in this
patient was consistent with attenuated FAP. Pilarski et al. (1999)
stated that this was the first reported case of attenuated FAP
associated with a germline deletion of the entire APC gene.

.0043
FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 1, ATTENUATED
APC, IVS3AS, G-A, -1

In 5 separately ascertained families from Newfoundland with attenuated
FAP1 (see 175100), Spirio et al. (1999) identified a G-to-A transition
in the splice acceptor site of intron 3 of the APC gene, which created a
mutant RNA without exon 4 of APC. The observation of the same APC
mutation in 5 families from the same geographic area suggested a founder
effect. The identification of this germline mutation strengthened the
correlation between the 5-prime location of an APC disease-causing
mutation and the attenuated polyposis phenotype.

.0044
FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 1
APC, 11-BP INS, NT1060

Rozen et al. (1999) reported a large kindred in which a novel 11-bp
insertion (AAGGATGATAT) at nucleotide position 1060 (codon 353) in exon
9 of the APC gene segregated with classic FAP with or without colorectal
cancer (175100). In at least 5 mutation carriers, however, there were no
clinical, endoscopic, or histologic features of FAP at the time of the
study. The authors commented that this family highlighted the possible
contribution of low penetrance germline APC mutations to 'sporadic'
colorectal neoplasia.

.0045
DESMOID DISEASE, HEREDITARY
APC, 4-BP DEL, 7929TCTA

In affected members of a large French-Canadian kindred with hereditary
desmoid disease (135290), Couture et al. (2000) identified a
heterozygous 4-bp deletion (7929delTCTA) at codons 2643-2644 of the APC
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The mutant
APC allele did not express a stable truncated protein in vivo. The
phenotype was characterized by the early onset of multiple tumors,
arising near the axial skeleton and in proximal extremities. Although
penetrance of desmoid tumors was nearly 100%, expression of the disease
was variable. Many gene carriers had cutaneous cysts. Polyposis of the
colon was rarely observed in the affected individuals and no upper
gastrointestinal polyps were documented. In a desmoid tumor from the
proband, Couture et al. (2000) identified a somatic 1-bp deletion
(3720delT; 611731.0046) in codon 1240 of the APC gene.

.0046
DESMOID TUMOR, SOMATIC
APC, 1-BP DEL, 3720T

Couture et al. (2000) identified a somatic 1-bp deletion (3720delT) in
codon 1240 of the APC gene in desmoid tumor tissue from a patient with
hereditary desmoid disease (135290) and a germline mutation in the APC
gene (611731.0045). Immunohistochemistry on the tumor tissue
demonstrated elevated levels of beta-catenin (116806).

.0047
GARDNER SYNDROME
APC, GLN208TER

In a man with Gardner syndrome (see 175100) reported by Dhaliwal et al.
(1990), Su et al. (2001) identified a gln208-to-ter (Q208X) mutation in
the APC gene. The patient's 28-year-old son was diagnosed with FAP at
age 15 and underwent proctocolectomy at the age of 23. The son also
developed multiple intraperitoneal desmoid tumors and a hepatocellular
carcinoma. In the liver tumor of the son, Su et al. (2001) showed that
the wildtype allele of the APC gene carried a somatic 1-bp deletion at
codon 568 (611731.0048). The somatic APC mutation was not found in the
surrounding normal tissue.

.0048
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, SOMATIC
APC, 1-BP DEL

In a hepatocellular tumor (114550) of a patient with Gardner syndrome
(see 175100 and 611731.0047), Su et al. (2001) identified a somatic 1-bp
deletion at codon 568 of the APC gene. The somatic APC mutation was not
found in the surrounding normal tissue.

.0049
FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 1, ATTENUATED
APC, 56-KB DEL, EX15DEL

In a proband who had a phenotype consistent with attenuated FAP1 (see
175100), Su et al. (2002) found a genomic rearrangement resulting in a
56-kb deletion and consequent removal of the entire exon 15 of the APC
gene. This rearrangement also resulted in a hybrid gene between APC and
U2AF1RS1 (601079).

.0050
FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 1
APC, 73-KB DEL, EX15DEL

In a family with features of classic FAP1 (175100), Su et al. (2002)
detected a genomic rearrangement resulting in a 73-kb deletion and
consequent removal of the entire exon 15 of the APC gene.

.0051
FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS 1
APC, 5-BP DEL, NT3221

In the Spanish Balearic Islands, Gonzalez et al. (2005) found that a
5-bp deletion (3221_3225delACAAA) at codon 1061 of the APC gene was the
most common basis for FAP1 (175100). Haplotype analysis of 5 families
was consistent with a founder effect.

602308	TITLE *602308 WW DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; WWP2
;;WW DOMAIN-CONTAINING E3 UBIQUITIN PROTEIN LIGASE 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The WW domain is a 35- to 40-amino acid protein-protein interaction
motif characterized by 4 conserved aromatic residues, 2 of which are
tryptophan. Using COLT (cloning of ligand targets), Pirozzi et al.
(1997) screened human bone marrow and brain cDNA expression libraries
with putative WW domain peptide ligand sequences and recovered 3
distinct proteins, WWP1 (602307), WWP2, and WWP3 (602625). WWP2 contains
4 tandem WW domains, a complete HECT (homologous to the E6-associated
protein carboxyl terminus) domain, which is associated with
ubiquitin-protein ligase activity, and a C2 (calcium-dependent
phospholipid-binding)-like domain characteristic of a large family of
proteins that includes protein kinase C (see 176960). Based on
similarities in structure between NEDD4 (602278) and WWP2, Pirozzi et
al. (1997) suggested that WWP2 belongs to a family of NEDD4-like
proteins.

By Northern blot analysis, Wood et al. (1998) detected a 5-kb WWP2
transcript in heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, muscle, kidney, and
pancreas.

Xu et al. (2004) cloned mouse Wwp2. The deduced 870-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of 98.7 kD and shares 96% identity with
human WWP2. Northern blot analysis detected 2 Wwp2 transcripts, with
highest expression in testis, followed by spleen, kidney, and liver. Low
expression was detected in brain, heart, and lung, and no expression was
detected in skeletal muscle. Immunofluorescence microscopy localized
Wwp2 in the nucleus and cytoplasm of mouse embryonic stem cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro assays, Pirozzi et al. (1997) showed that individual WW
domains of WWP1, WWP2, and WWP3 could selectively bind particular
peptide ligands.

Using yeast 2-hybrid and in vitro binding studies, Wood et al. (1998)
demonstrated that WWP2, which they called AIP2, bound to atrophin-1
(DRPLA; 607462).

Using affinity chromatography, Xu et al. (2004) showed that mouse Wwp2
interacted with Oct4 (POU5F1; 164177), a transcription factor that
regulates the fate of embryonic stem cells. Mutation analysis showed
that the WW domains of Wwp2 were required for the interaction, and both
the N- and C-terminal regions of Oct4 could interact with Wwp2. Wwp2
ubiquitinated Oct4 in vitro and in vivo, and this activity required the
catalytic cysteine within the HECT domain of Wwp2. Ubiquitination of
Oct4 inhibited its transcriptional activity and directed its degradation
by the proteasome. Expression of both Wwp2 and Oct4 was reduced with
differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Wood et al. (1998) mapped the WWP2 gene to
chromosome 16q21.

610428	TITLE *610428 CYTOCHROME c OXIDASE ASSEMBLY PROTEIN COX18; COX18
;;COX18, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF;;
MITOCHONDRIAL COX18
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

COX18 encodes a cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-assembly protein. The S.
cerevisiae Cox18 protein catalyzes the insertion of the Cox2 (MTCO2;
516040) C-terminal tail into the mitochondrial inner membrane, an
intermediate step in the assembly of complex IV of the mitochondrial
respiratory chain (Sacconi et al., 2005).

CLONING

Using database analysis with S. cerevisiae Cox18 as query, followed by
PCR techniques, Sacconi et al. (2005) cloned COX18 cDNA from skin
fibroblasts. The deduced 333-amino acid protein has a predicted
molecular mass of 37.1 kD. COX18 shares 25% amino acid identity with S.
cerevisiae Cox18 and shares homology with mitochondrial inner membrane
protein Oxa1 (see OXA1L; 601066). Database analysis and comparison to
yeast Cox18 and Oxa1 suggested that COX18 has 5 transmembrane domains.
Northern blot analysis detected a 3.5-kb transcript in all tissues
examined with highest expression in liver, heart, and pancreas. A
shorter transcript was detected at low levels. By RACE analysis, Sacconi
et al. (2005) identified 2 mRNAs of 3,406 and 2,027 nucleotides that are
transcribed from 2 different transcription start sites. Fluorescence
microscopy showed that COX18 expressed in HEK293 cells localized to
mitochondria.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sacconi et al. (2005) determined that the COX18 gene contains 7 exons
and spans about 25 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sacconi et al. (2005) mapped the COX18
gene to chromosome 4q21.1

;;CAS-INTERACTING ZINC FINGER PROTEIN; CIZ;;
CAGH1;;
NUCLEAR MATRIX PROTEIN 4; NMP4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZNF384 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that localizes at
fibroblast focal adhesions, contains multiple zinc fingers, and
regulates expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g., MMP3; 185250)
(Thunyakitpisal et al., 2001).

CLONING

By screening adult and fetal human brain cDNA libraries for clones
containing CAG repeats, Margolis et al. (1997) isolated a partial cDNA
encoding ZNF384, which they called CAGH1.

By Far Western screening of a rat embryonic fibroblast cDNA library with
the SH3 domain of Cas (BCAR1; 602941) as probe, Nakamoto et al. (2000)
isolated several splice variants of Znf384, which they called Ciz. The
longest variant encodes a predicted 579-residue protein with an
N-terminal leucine zipper, multiple serine and proline residues, a
nuclear localization signal, 8 centrally located Kruppel-type C2H2 zinc
fingers, and C-terminal glutamine-alanine and glutamine repeat regions,
suggesting that Ciz may be a transcription factor. The shorter variants
encode proteins with only 5 or 6 zinc fingers. Northern blot analysis of
rat tissues revealed ubiquitous expression of a 3.0-kb transcript, with
highest levels in testis, heart, kidney, and brain. A 4.0-kb transcript
was also detected in brain, liver, and kidney. Immunofluorescence
microscopy showed that Ciz shuttled in and out of the nucleus and
localized at stably formed focal adhesions and in the nucleus.

Thunyakitpisal et al. (2001) independently cloned and characterized rat
Znf384, which they termed Nmp4, based on its interaction with type I
collagen alpha-1 (COL1A1; 120150). They identified several novel
variants, including one that lacks the C-terminal glutamine-alanine
repeat region.

GENE FUNCTION

Using precipitation analysis, Nakamoto et al. (2000) showed that rat Ciz
bound specifically and constitutively to the SH3 domain of Cas.
Immunoprecipitation and EMSA analysis demonstrated that Ciz bound to the
promoter of human MMP1 (120353) and upregulated transcription of human
MMP1 and MMP7 (178990) and rat Mmp3.

Thunyakitpisal et al. (2001) showed that rat Nmp4 interacted with Col1a1
and regulated its expression in osteoblasts. They concluded that NMP4
contributes to extracellular matrix turnover in bone and other tissues.

Shen et al. (2002) overexpressed Ciz in a mouse osteoblast cell line and
found that it inhibited Bmp2 (112261)-induced expression of alkaline
phosphatase (see ALPL; 171760), osteocalcin (BGLAP; 112260), type I
collagen, and Cbfa1 (RUNX2; 600211). They concluded that CIZ is an
inhibitory protein that modulates BMP2-induced differentiation of
osteoblastic cells.

MAPPING

Margolis et al. (1997) stated that the ZFN384 gene maps to chromosome
12p12. Alvarez et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Znf384 gene to chromosome
6F1, a region that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 12p12.

ANIMAL MODEL

Morinobu et al. (2005) found that Ciz -/- mice had increased bone volume
and rates of bone formation, but no alteration in bone resorption. Ciz
-/- mice expressed higher levels of mRNA for proteins involved in
osteoblastic phenotypes, such as alkaline phosphatase and osterix (SP7;
606633). Ciz deficiency increased newly formed bone mass after femoral
bone marrow ablation, and it increased Bmp2-induced bone formation in
adult mouse calvariae. Morinobu et al. (2005) concluded that CIZ
suppresses the levels of adult bone mass through inhibition of
BMP-induced activation of osteoblasts.

615320	TITLE *615320 GDP-MANNOSE PYROPHOSPHORYLASE B; GMPPB
;;GDP-MANNOSE PYROPHOSPHORYLASE, BETA SUBUNIT;;
GMPP-BETA;;
KIAA1851
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The GMPPB gene encodes the beta subunit of an essential enzyme,
GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.13), that catalyzes the
conversion of mannose-1-phosphate and GTP to inorganic diphosphate and
GDP-mannose, a major mannosyl donor for mannose-containing polymers
(Ning and Elbein, 2000). GDP-mannose is required in 4 glycosylation
pathways, including O-mannosylation of membrane and secretory
glycoproteins, such as alpha-dystroglycan (DAG1; 128239) (summary by
Carss et al., 2013).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) obtained a GMPPB clone, which they
designated KIAA1851. RT-PCR ELISA detected uniform GMPPB expression in
all adult and fetal tissues and specific adult brain regions examined.

By searching databases for sequences similar to porcine Gmpp-beta, Ning
and Elbein (2000) identified human GMPPB, as well as GMPPB orthologs in
several lower species, including nematode, yeast, and plants. The
360-amino acid human protein shares 96% identity with porcine Gmpp-beta.

The GMPPB protein contains 2 main functional domains: a nucleotidyl
transferase domain and a bacterial transferase hexapeptide domain. Carss
et al. (2013) determined that the GMPPB gene is transcribed as 2
isoforms in human tissues. The longer isoform (GenBank GENBANK
NM_021971.1) was strongly expressed in all fetal and adult tissues
tested, including brain and skeletal muscle, whereas the shorter isoform
(GenBank GENBANK NM_013334.2) was weakly expressed in the tissues
tested. There appeared to be no developmental difference in the
expression of the 2 isoforms.

GENE STRUCTURE

The coding DNA sequence of one isoform of the GMPPB gene (GenBank
GENBANK NM_021971.1) contains 10 exons, whereas that of another isoform
(GenBank GENBANK NM_013334.2) contains 8 exons (Carss et al., 2013).

GENE FUNCTION

Ning and Elbein (2000) found that recombinant porcine Gmpp-beta
catalyzed bidirectional conversion of mannose-1-phosphate and GTP to
inorganic diphosphate and GDP-mannose. Compared with purified pig liver
Gmpp, which was a dimer of alpha and beta subunits, recombinant
Gmpp-beta showed much lower activity as a GDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase
(EC 2.7.7.34). Divalent cations, particularly Mn(2+), enhanced the
Gmpp-beta reaction, whereas Mg(2+) was the preferred cofactor for the
endogenous dimeric enzyme.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the GMPPB gene to chromosome 3p21.31 based on an
alignment of the GMPPB sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB058754) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By exome sequencing combined with Sanger sequencing of 8 unrelated
patients with various forms of congenital muscular dystrophy, Carss et
al. (2013) identified 8 different mutations in the GMPPB gene (GenBank
GENBANK NM_02197.1) (615320.0001-615320.0008). All mutations occurred in
the homozygous or compound heterozygous state and segregated with the
disorder in the families in whom parental DNA was available. All
affected individuals had at least 1 mutation affecting the highly
conserved nucleotidyl transferase domain. The phenotype was highly
variable. The most severely affected patient had muscle weakness at
birth with severely delayed psychomotor development, retinal
dysfunction, and pontocerebellar hypoplasia, reminiscent of
muscle-eye-brain disease and consistent with congenital muscular
dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy with brain and eye anomalies type A14
(MDDGA14; 615350). Four patients presented with a slightly milder
phenotype with onset of muscle weakness in the first months of life with
milder intellectual disability with or without cerebellar hypoplasia,
consistent with congenital muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy with
mental retardation type B14 (MDDGB14; 615351). The least severe
phenotype, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy type C14
(MDDGC14; 615352) was present in 3 unrelated patients, 1 of whom had
onset at age 4 and normal intellectual function. Variable features seen
in some patients included microcephaly, seizures, cataracts, and cardiac
dysfunction. All patients had dystrophic features on muscle biopsy, and
immunohistochemical and flow cytometric analysis of patient cells showed
reduced glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. Overexpression of wildtype
GMPPB in fibroblasts from an affected individual partially restored
glycosylation of DAG1. Whereas wildtype GMPPB localized to the
cytoplasm, 5 of the identified missense mutations caused formation of
aggregates in the cytoplasm or near membrane protrusions. Knockdown of
the GMPPB ortholog in zebrafish caused structural muscle defects with
decreased motility, eye abnormalities, and reduced glycosylation of
DAG1. None of the patients had evidence of abnormal serum transferrin
glycoforms.

ANIMAL MODEL

Carss et al. (2013) found that zebrafish Gmppb is expressed throughout
development. Morpholino knockdown of Gmppb in zebrafish resulted in
smaller embryos with multiple anomalies, including bent tails,
hypopigmentation, microphthalmia, hydrocephalus, and reduced motility.
Muscle fibers in mutant zebrafish were sparse and disorganized, and the
myosepta were damaged or incompletely developed. There was also evidence
of sarcolemmal damage. Immunostaining showed defective glycosylation of
DAG1 associated with abnormal structure of the basement membrane. These
findings were reminiscent of the muscular dystrophy phenotype found in
humans with GMPPB mutations.

GMPPB, ASP334ASN

In a patient (P1) with congenital muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy
with brain and eye anomalies type A14 (MDDGA14; 615350), Carss et al.
(2013) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the GMPPB gene: a
c.1000G-A transition resulting in an asp334-to-asn (D334N) substitution
at a highly conserved residue at the C terminus, and a c.220C-T
transition resulting in an arg74-to-ter (R74X; 615320.0002)
substitution. The mutation were identified by exome sequencing and
confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous
for 1 of the mutations. Transfection of the D334N mutation into
myoblasts caused the protein to form cytoplasmic aggregates. The R74X
mutation, which occurs in the nucleotidyl transferase domain, is
predicted to cause a severely truncated protein and nonsense-mediated
mRNA. The patient had severely delayed psychomotor development,
sensorineural hearing loss, retinal dysfunction, and pontine and
cerebellar hypoplasia on brain MRI. Studies of the patient's skeletal
muscle and fibroblasts showed decreased glycosylation of
alpha-dystroglycan (DAG1; 128239), which was partially restored by
transfection of wildtype GMPPB. An unrelated patient (P2) with a
somewhat less severe phenotype, limb-girdle muscular
dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy type C14 (MDDGC14; 615352) with mental
retardation, was found to be compound heterozygous for D334N and a
c.64C-T transition resulting in a pro22-to-ser (P22S; 615320.0003)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the nucleotidyl
transferase domain. Transfection of the P22S mutation into myoblasts
caused the protein to aggregate near membrane protrusions into the
cytoplasm.

In 2 unrelated Mexican patients (P3 and P4) with congenital muscular
dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy with mental retardation type B14 (MDDGB14;
615351), Carss et al. (2013) identified a homozygous c.553C-T transition
in the GMPPB gene, resulting in an arg185-to-cys (R185C) substitution at
a highly conserved residue in the nucleotidyl transferase domain. The
mutation was found in 1 of the patients by exome sequencing and
confirmed in both patients by Sanger sequencing. The unaffected mother
of 1 of the patients was heterozygous for the mutation. Exome sequencing
of an Egyptian patient (P8) with a somewhat less severe phenotype,
limb-girdle muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy type C14 (MDDGC14;
615352) with mental retardation and cardiorespiratory dysfunction, also
yielded a homozygous R185C mutation. The unaffected parents of this
patient were heterozygous for the mutation. Transfection of the R185C
mutation into myoblasts caused the protein to remain evenly distributed
in the cytoplasm and had no discernible changes compared to wildtype.

In 2 unrelated Italian girls (P5, P6) with MDDGB14 with mental

Carss et al. (2013) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations
in the GMPPB gene: c.95C-T transition resulting in a pro32-to-leu (P32L)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the nucleotidyl
transferase domain, and a c.860G-A transition resulting in an
arg287-to-gln (R287Q; 615320.0006) substitution. The mutations, which
were found by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing,
segregated with the disorder in both families. P32L had not been
reported, and R287Q is rare and has a minor allele frequency of less
than or equal to 0.001 in database controls. Transfection of both
mutations into myoblasts caused the protein to form aggregates within
the cytoplasm.

In a 6-year-old English boy (P7) with MDDGC14 (615351) without mental
retardation, Carss et al. (2013) identified compound heterozygous
mutations in the GMPPB gene: a c.79G-C transversion, resulting in an
asp27-to-his (D27H) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
nucleotidyl transferase domain, and a c.988G-A transition, resulting in
a val330-to-ile (V330I; 615320.0008) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in the C terminus. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1
of the mutations. Both variants are rare, with minor allele frequencies
of less than or equal to 0.001 in database controls. Transfection of the
D27H mutation into myoblasts caused the protein to remain evenly
distributed in the cytoplasm and had no discernible changes compared to
wildtype, whereas transfection of V330I caused the protein to form
aggregates within the cytoplasm. The patient had a mild form of the

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cui et al. (1996) used degenerate PCR to screen for protein-tyrosine
phosphatases (PTPases) in a human colon carcinoma cell cDNA library and
isolated the PTPRN2 gene, which termed IAR (for islet antigen-related).
The predicted protein of 1,015 amino acids is 43% identical to IA2
(PTPRN; 601773), an autoantigen associated with insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus (IDDM; 222100). They found that the intracellular
domains of IAR and IA2 are 73% identical. Northern blot analysis showed
that IAR was expressed as 5.5- and 3.7-kb transcripts primarily in human
brain and pancreas. Cui et al. (1996) noted that the IAR extracellular
region contains the adhesion recognition peptide sequence RDGS. The
authors demonstrated that IAR has phosphatase activity. They found that
IAR is reactive with sera from patients with IDDM and that IAR and IA2
identify overlapping but nonidentical sets of IDDM patients. Morahan et
al. (1998) noted that autoantibodies to IAR are significantly more
predictive of disease than those to IA2.

Kawasaki et al. (1996) cloned and characterized a human cDNA for the
PTPRN2 gene, which they called phogrin. Wasmeier and Hutton (1996)
originally identified phogrin, named for 'phosphatase homolog in
granules of insulinoma,' by expression screening of a rat insulinoma
cDNA library. The human phogrin gene, with a predicted molecular mass of
111,303 Da, encodes a 1,015-amino acid polypeptide with a single
transmembrane region and 1 putative tyrosine phosphatase catalytic
domain. The authors found phogrin to share 74% identity with the
ICA512/IA2 cytoplasmic domain, but only 29% identity with the luminal
domain. 48% (37 of 77) and 61% (47 of 77) of sera from new-onset
patients with type I diabetes were positive for autoantibodies to
full-length and the cytoplasmic domain of phogrin, respectively.

Lu et al. (1996) isolated the mouse gene for IAR, termed IA2-beta. Many
IDDM sera are known to immunoprecipitate 37-kD and 40-kD tryptic
fragments from islet cells. Lu et al. (1996) showed that IA2-beta and
IA2 are the precursors of the 37-kD and 40-kD islet cell autoantigens,
respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

After administration of ghrelin (605353), Doi et al. (2006) observed
increases in Ia2-beta in mouse brain, pancreas, and insulinoma cell
lines, but not Ia2. Administration of ghrelin or Ia2-beta overexpression
inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in insulinoma cells, and
inhibition of Ia2-beta overexpression by RNA interference ameliorated
ghrelin's inhibitory effects on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.
Doi et al. (2006) suggested that the inhibitory effects of ghrelin on
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion are at least partly due to
increased expression of Ia2-beta induced by ghrelin.

MAPPING

By FISH analysis, Smith et al. (1996) mapped the PTPRN2 gene to
chromosome 7q36. Morahan et al. (1998) provided refined mapping of the
PTPRN and PTPRN2 genes on the high-resolution radiation hybrid map of
chromosomes 2 and 7, respectively.

F52
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Umekage and Kato (1991) identified a cDNA with homology to MARCKS
(PKCSL; 177061) among mouse brain cDNAs with specific brain expression
patterns. The myristoylated, alanine-rich protein MARCKS is a widely
expressed, prominent substrate for protein kinase C (see 176960), a key
enzyme of intracellular signal transduction. The predicted 200-amino
acid protein, which they called F52, shares 52% amino acid identity with
bovine MARCKS. The similarity between the 2 proteins is found in the
consensus myristoylation sequence near the N-terminus and in the
25-amino acid protein kinase C phosphorylation site domain. F52 has a
similar amino acid composition to MARCKS, although its alanine content
is not as high. It is distributed throughout the mouse brain in a
pattern that is distinct from that of MARCKS.

By screening a genomic library with portions of the Mrp cDNA, Stumpo et
al. (1998) isolated the human homolog, which they designated MLP for
'MARCKS-like protein.' They reported that the sequences of the mouse and
human promoters were 71% identical over 433 bp. A transgene containing
this 433-bp fragment from mouse linked to a reporter Mrp
beta-galactosidase gene produced normal patterns of Mrp expression in
the developing mouse embryo.

Using Northern hybridization, Lobach et al. (1993) observed Mrp
expression in various mouse tissues, with highest levels in testis and
uterus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lobach et al. (1993) reported that the mouse F52, or Mrp, gene contains
a single intron at a position exactly analogous to that of the single
intron in mouse, cow, and human MARCKS.

MAPPING

By analysis of an interspecific backcross, Lobach et al. (1993) mapped
the Mrp gene to a position on mouse chromosome 4 that was closely linked
to the Lck (153390) locus. Based on homology of synteny, they predicted
that the human homolog would map to chromosome 1p35-p32. Using somatic
cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization, Stumpo et
al. (1998) confirmed that the human MLP gene maps to 1p34.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wu et al. (1996) used gene targeting to generate Mrp-deficient mice.
They observed severe neural tube defects (NTD) including exencephaly,
spina bifida, and tail flexion anomaly in approximately 60% of the
homozygous mutants and in approximately 10% of heterozygous animals. The
homozygous mutants without exencephaly survived despite brain
abnormalities, which appear to occur secondarily to the NTD. Wu et al.
(1996) suggested that mutations in Mrp result in isolated NTD and
therefore may provide an animal model for common human NTD.

606801	TITLE *606801 MACROPHAGE ERYTHROBLAST ATTACHER; MAEA
;;ERYTHROBLAST MACROPHAGE PROTEIN; EMP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The association of erythroblasts with macrophages plays a central role
in the terminal maturation and enucleation of erythroblasts. MAEA
mediates attachment of erythroblasts to macrophages.

CLONING

Hanspal et al. (1998) cloned an MAEA cDNA from a human macrophage cDNA
expression library using antibody to the purified protein as probe. The
deduced 395-amino acid protein has a small N-terminal domain, a single
transmembrane domain, and a large cytoplasmic domain containing several
tyrosine residues that, when phosphorylated, could interact with protein
recognition modules. MAEA has a calculated molecular mass of 43 kD.
Recombinant protein, and protein expressed by transfected COS-7 cells,
showed an apparent molecular mass of 36 kD by SDS-PAGE. By Northern blot
analysis, Hanspal et al. (1998) found ubiquitous expression of a 2.1-kb
transcript in all tissues and cells examined. By Western blot analysis,
they identified 2 isoforms with apparent molecular masses of 36 kD and
33 kD in macrophage membranes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using several cell attachment assays, Hanspal et al. (1998) found that
both MAEA isoforms could bind erythroblasts and that binding was
mediated by the extracellular N terminus. They also determined that
MAEA-mediated cell-cell contact prevents apoptosis in maturing
erythroblasts.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MAEA
gene to chromosome 4 (TMAP WI-13069).

;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 6; LEP6
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE1F,
which they called LEP6. RT-PCR showed that LEP6 was highly expressed in
skin, with low levels in internal epithelia.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) detected LCE1F expression in
human fetal, arm, penal, and abdominal skin, as well as in vulva and
fibroblasts, but not in tongue or esophagus.

GENE FUNCTION

Jackson et al. (2005) showed that expression of LCE1 genes, including
LCE1F, was upregulated in normal human keratinocytes by ultraviolet
irradiation, but not by calcium.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that the LCE1F gene contains 2 exons.
Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE1F
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) stated that the mouse Lce1f gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene
cluster on chromosome 3F1.

607284	TITLE *607284 LSM4 PROTEIN; LSM4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sm-like proteins were identified in a variety of organisms based on
sequence homology with the Sm protein family (see SNRPD2; 601061).
Sm-like proteins contain the Sm sequence motif, which consists of 2
regions separated by a linker of variable length that folds as a loop.
The Sm-like proteins are thought to form a stable heteromer present in
tri-snRNP particles, which are important for pre-mRNA splicing.

CLONING

In a search for human Sm-like proteins, Achsel et al. (1999)
fractionated proteins present in purified (U4/U6.U5) tri-snRNPs and
isolated 7 Sm-like proteins, which they named LSm2-LSm8. Using partial
peptide sequence for database searches, they identified and sequenced
EST clones. Using additional sequence obtained by PCR amplification of a
HeLa cDNA library, they assembled full-length cDNA sequences for
LSM2-LSM8.

Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999) searched database sequence for Sm proteins
and identified 16 potential Sm-related genes in yeast as well as some
Sm-related genes in human and archaebacteria. Using a multiple sequence
alignment of Sm domains, they built a phylogenetic tree of yeast, human,
and archaeal Sm and Sm-like proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Using electron-microscopy, Achsel et al. (1999) observed that purified
LSm proteins form a heteromer that is stable even in the absence of RNA
and exhibits a doughnut-shaped structure similar to the Sm core RNP
structure. They demonstrated that the purified LSm heteromer binds
specifically to the U6 snRNA at its 3-prime-terminal U-tract. They also
showed that the LSm proteins facilitate the formation of U4/U6 RNA
duplexes in vitro and concluded that the LSm proteins may play a role in
U4/U6 snRNP formation.

Using immunoprecipitation experiments, Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
concluded that there is a complex of 7 Sm-like proteins bound to RNA in
yeast. Lsm2-Lsm8 coprecipitate the U4, U5 and U6 snRNAs and directly
associate with the U6 snRNA present in the free U6 snRNP. Additionally,
the yeast Lsm2-Lsm7 proteins were found to be associated with the
pre-RNase P RNA but not the mature RNase RNA. Using immunoprecipitation
experiments from human cell extracts, Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
showed that the LSM3 and LSM4 proteins are specifically associated with
snRNP complexes containing the U6 snRNA. Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
concluded that Sm and Sm-like proteins assemble in at least 2
functionally conserved complexes of deep evolutionary origin.

By disrupting the Sm and Sm-like genes in yeast, Salgado-Garrido et al.
(1999) concluded that disruption of genes encoding Sm-like proteins
directly associated with the U6 snRNA (Lsm2-8) generated variable
phenotypes. Lsm2, Lsm3, Lsm4, and Lsm8 are essential for vegetative
growth. Lsm5, Lsm6, and Lsm7 are not essential for growth; however,
their disruptions lead to slow growth especially at elevated
temperature. The levels of the U6 snRNA were strongly reduced in the
strains harboring the Lsm5, Lsm6, and Lsm7 disruptions. Lsm1 and Lsm9
are dispensable for vegetative growth, but Lsm1 is required for optimal
vegetative growth at 30 degrees and is temperature sensitive.

Ingelfinger et al. (2002) determined that human LSM1 to LSM7, but not
LSM8, were expressed in HeLa cells within cytoplasmic foci. The foci
also contained a decapping enzyme (DCP1/2) and the exonuclease XRN1
(607994). Coexpression of wildtype and mutant LSM proteins, as well as
fluorescence resonance energy transfer, indicated that the LSM proteins
form a complex similar to one found in yeast. Ingelfinger et al. (2002)
concluded that the foci contain a partially or fully assembled machinery
for the degradation of mRNA.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the LSM4
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP stSG3964).

608618	TITLE *608618 FAMILY WITH SEQUENCE SIMILARITY 3, MEMBER C; FAM3C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a database for sequences similar to FAM3A (300492),
followed by RT-PCR of heart mRNA, Zhu et al. (2002) cloned FAM3C. The
deduced 227-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide.
The authors predicted that FAM3C forms a 4-helix bundle, and
3-dimensional modeling indicated that 4 cysteines could form 2 disulfide
bonds linking helices 1 and 4 and helices 2 and 3. Northern blot
analysis detected FAM3C expression in almost all tissues tested.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the FAM3C
gene to chromosome 7 (TMAP STS-H88599).

605082	TITLE *605082 RAS ASSOCIATION DOMAIN FAMILY PROTEIN 1; RASSF1
;;RASSF1A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RASSF1A is a tumor suppressor gene whose inactivation has been
implicated in a wide variety of sporadic human cancers. It regulates
several biologic processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis,
and microtubule stability. RASSF1A lacks apparent enzymatic activity,
but it contains a RAS association domain and is thought to be an
effector of RAS oncoproteins (see KRAS; 190070) (summary by Palakurthy
et al., 2009).

CLONING

Allelic loss at the short arm of chromosome 3 is one of the most common
and earliest events in the pathogenesis of lung cancer, and is observed
in more than 90% of small cell lung cancers (SCLCs; 182280) and in 50 to
80% of nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Frequent and early loss of
heterozygosity and the presence of homozygous deletions suggested a
critical role of the region 3p21.3 in tumorigenesis, and a region of
common homozygous deletion in 3p21.3 was narrowed to 120 kb by Sekido et
al. (1998). Several putative tumor-suppressor genes located at 3p21 had
been characterized, but none of these appeared to be altered in lung
cancer.

Dammann et al. (2000) described the cloning and characterization of a
human RAS effector homolog, RASSF1, located in the 120-kb region of
minimal homozygous deletion. They identified the RASSF1 protein through
its interaction with the human DNA repair protein XPA (611153) in a
yeast 2-hybrid screen. Dammann et al. (2000) detected 3 transcripts, A,
B, and C, derived from alternative splicing and promoter usage. The
major transcripts A and C were expressed in all normal tissues tested.
Transcript A was missing in all SCLC cell lines analyzed and in several
other cancer cell lines. Loss of expression was correlated with
methylation of the CpG island promoter sequence of RASSF1A. The promoter
was highly methylated in 24 of 60 (40%) primary lung tumors, and 4 of 41
tumors analyzed carried missense mutations. Reexpression of transcript A
in lung carcinoma cells reduced colony formation, suppressed
anchorage-independent growth, and inhibited tumor formation in nude
mice. These characteristics indicated a potential role for RASSF1A as a
lung tumor suppressor. Dammann et al. (2000) found no mutations in 17
SCLC cell lines, but found 4 missense mutations in 41 primary NSCLCs.

By physical cloning methodologies and bioinformatic computational
analyses, Lerman and Minna (2000) identified a number of genes,
including RASSF1, in a region of chromosome 3p21.3 that is associated
with a putative lung cancer tumor suppressor gene. The RASSF1 gene
encodes short and long isoforms, designated RASSF1A and RASSF1C,
respectively. The deduced 340-amino acid cytoplasmic RASSF1A protein,
which is 97% identical to the mouse protein, contains a DAG-binding
domain that is also found in NORE1 (607020). The RASSF1C cytoplasmic
protein contains 270 residues and no DAG-binding domain. Northern blot
analysis revealed wide expression of a 2.0-kb transcript that was
strongest in heart and pancreas, followed by placenta and skeletal
muscle, and weakest in brain, lung, liver, and kidney. The shorter
isoform, but not the longer isoform, was expressed in most lung cancer
cell lines tested. No mutations were detected in any of the lines.

Clear cell renal cell carcinomas are characterized almost universally by
loss of heterozygosity on 3p, which usually involves any combination of
3 regions: 3p26-p25, which harbors the VHL gene (608537); 3p14.2-p12,
which contains the FHIT gene (601153); and 3p22-p21, which was presumed
also to contain a tumor suppressor gene. Dreijerink et al. (2001)
presented data suggesting that the RASSF1A gene is a candidate renal
tumor suppressor gene for the centromeric 3p21.3 region.

GENE FUNCTION

The RASSF1A locus is epigenetically inactivated at high frequency in a
variety of solid tumors. Shivakumar et al. (2002) found that
reintroduction of RASSF1A expression in lung and breast tumor-derived
epithelial cells resulted in growth arrest but not apoptosis. The growth
arrest correlated with inhibition of cyclin D1 (168461) protein
accumulation, which likely prevented RASSF1A-expressing cells from
passing through the RB (614041) family cell cycle restriction point and
entering S phase. Regulation of cyclin D1 accumulation by RASSF1A was
independent of the cyclin D1 promoter and likely occurred through
inhibition of mRNA translation. RASSF1A activity was also
phosphorylation dependent. RNA interference-mediated inhibition of
RASSF1A protein expression resulted in abnormal accumulation of native
cyclin D1 protein in the absence of detectable changes in cyclin D1 mRNA
levels. Shivakumar et al. (2002) concluded that RASSF1A functions as a
negative regulator of cell proliferation through inhibition of
G1/S-phase progression.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid system, Fenton et al. (2004) found that RASSF1
interacted with E4F1 (603022), a phosphoprotein involved in cell cycle
progression. The 2 proteins formed a complex in vivo in a mouse
fibroblast cell line and in a human nonsmall cell lung cancer line.
Specific inactivation of Rassf1a by short interfering RNA disrupted the
binding of Rassf1a to E4f1 in immunoprecipitation assays. In addition,
there was enhanced G1 cell cycle arrest and S-phase inhibition by E4f1
in the presence of Rassf1a.

Song et al. (2004) identified RASSF1A as mitosis-specific inhibitor of
the APC/C (anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome), a large multisubunit
complex that collaborates with ubiquitin-conjugating and
ubiquitin-activating enzymes that catalyze the formation of
polyubiquitin chains on its protein substrates, targeting them for
degradation by the proteasome. A number of regulatory mechanisms
cooperate to restrict the activity of APC/C to a specific period in the
cell cycle. As reviewed by Mathe (2004), the RASSF1 gene contributes to
the spatiotemporal regulation of mitosis through a novel mechanism. By
interacting with Cdc20 (603618), its protein product inhibits the APC
and prevents degradation of cyclin A (see CCNA1, 604036) and cyclin B
(see CCNB1, 123836) until the spindle checkpoint becomes fully
operational.

Baksh et al. (2005) found that ectopic expression of RASSF1A in a breast
cancer cell line enhanced apoptosis, acting upstream of the
mitochondria. Conversely, reducing RASSF1A by RNA interference in
osteosarcoma and breast cancer cells or by gene deletion in Rassf1a-null
mouse embryonic fibroblasts specifically impaired death
receptor-dependent apoptosis. Death receptor stimulation resulted in the
formation of a complex between RASSF1A and MAP1 (MOAP1; 609485). In the
absence of RASSF1A, MAP1 appeared to exist in an inactive closed
conformation in which the BH3-like domain was unavailable for
interaction with BAX (600040). RASSF1A binding relieved the inhibitory
interaction, allowing MAP1 to bind BAX. RASSF1A/MAP1 interaction was
required for conformational change in BAX, mitochondrial membrane
insertion, and maximal apoptosis in response to death receptor
stimulation. RASSF1A and MAP1 were recruited to both the TNF-alpha
(191160) and TRAIL (603598) receptor complexes in response to their
respective cognate ligands.

Matallanas et al. (2007) reconstructed an apoptotic signaling pathway
initiated by RASSF1A in human cells. Key steps in this pathway included
disruption of the inhibitory RAF1 (164760)-MST2 (STK3; 605030) complex
by RASSF1A and concomitant enhancement of MST2 interaction with LATS1
(603473). LATS1 then phosphorylated YAP1 (606608), allowing YAP1 to
translocate to the nucleus and associate with p73 (TP73; 601990),
resulting in p73-mediated transcription of the proapoptotic target gene
PUMA (BBC3; 605854). Matallanas et al. (2007) hypothesized that
silencing of RASSF1A in some tumors removes a p73-dependent proapoptotic
signal.

Using a genomewide small hairpin RNA screen of human tumor cell lines,
Palakurthy et al. (2009) found that HOXB3 (142966) knockdown resulted in
derepression of epigenetically silenced RASSF1A, leading to elevated
RASSF1A expression. HOXB3 caused RASSF1A silencing by binding the DNA
methyltransferase DNMT3B (602900), which was then recruited to the
RASSF1A promoter, resulting in RASSF1A hypermethylation and silencing.
Recruitment of DNMT3B was facilitated through interactions with Polycomb
repressor complex-2 (see EZH1; 601674) and MYC (190080), which was bound
to the RASSF1A promoter. RASSF1A silencing was detected in 6 of 10 human
lung adenocarcinomas, and in 5 of these 6, RASSF1A downregulation
strongly correlated with overexpression of HOXB3 and DNMT3B.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Lerman and Minna (2000) determined that
the RASSF1 gene contains 5 exons and spans 7.6 kb.

MAPPING

Dammann et al. (2000) determined that the RASSF1 gene resides in a
120-kb critical region for a lung cancer tumor suppressor gene on
chromosome 3p21.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Harada et al. (2002) examined the methylation status of 9 genes in 175
primary pediatric tumors and 23 tumor cell lines using
methylation-specific PCR. They studied the major forms of pediatric
tumors: Wilms tumor (see 194070), neuroblastoma (see 256700),
hepatoblastoma, medulloblastoma (155255), rhabdomyosarcoma (see 268210),
osteosarcoma (259500), Ewing sarcoma (612219), retinoblastoma (180200),
and acute leukemia. The most frequently methylated gene in both primary
tumors and cell lines was RASSF1A (40% and 86%, respectively). However,
the rates of RASSF1A methylation in individual tumor types varied from 0
to 88%. RASSF1A methylation was tumor specific and was absent in
adjacent nonmalignant tissues. Methylation of other genes was relatively
rare in tumors and nonmalignant tissues (less than 5%). Neuroblastoma
patients with methylation of RASSF1A were significantly older than
patients without methylation (P = 0.008). There was no relationship
between methylation status and other clinicopathologic parameters. Six
cell lines lacking RASSF1A mRNA were treated with
5-aza-2-prime-deoxycytidine to examine the relationship between
methylation and transcriptional silencing. In 5 of these 6 cell lines,
restoration of RASSF1A mRNA was confirmed by RT-PCR. The findings of
Harada et al. (2002) indicated that aberrant promoter methylation of
RASSF1A may contribute to the pathogenesis of many different forms of
pediatric tumors.

Kok et al. (1997) identified several distinct regions on chromosome 3p
that show frequent allelic losses in lung and other sporadic cancers,
which suggests that multiple tumor suppressor genes may reside on 3p and
that their inactivation plays a role in the pathogenesis of a number of
common sporadic cancers. Identification of overlapping homozygous
deletions in lung and breast tumors and tumor lines led to the
identification of 2 lung cancer tumor suppressor gene regions (LCTSGRs)
at 3p21.3 (LCTSGR1) and 3p12 (LCTSGR2) (Lerman and Minna, 2000). The
3p21.3 region contains several genes, including RASSF1A. Agathanggelou
et al. (2001) reported findings suggesting that RASSF1A inactivation by
2 hits (methylation and loss) is a critical step in tumorigenesis of
SCLC and that RASSF1A inactivation is of lesser importance in NSCLC,
breast, ovarian, and cervical cancers in which other genes within
LCTSGR1 are likely to be implicated.

In a study of patients with stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer (see
211980) who underwent curative resection but had a recurrence compared
to matched patients who did not have a recurrence, Brock et al. (2008)
found that promoter methylation of the CDKN2A (600160), CDH13 (601364),
RASSF1A, and APC (611731) genes in tumors and in histologically
tumor-negative lymph nodes was independently associated with tumor
recurrence.

;;HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA COMPLICATING HEMOCHROMATOSIS;;
HC/HCC
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kedar et al. (1996) used differential display reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (DDRT-PCR) to identify a partial mRNA, termed
HC/HCC by them, that was strongly expressed in the liver of a patient
with hemochromatosis (HC; 235200) and in tumor tissue from a subject
with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) complicating HC. The HC/HCC cDNA,
encoding a 9.5-kb transcript, consists of 342 amino acid residues. By
Northern blot analysis, Kedar et al. (1996) showed that the message of
this gene is present at very low levels in normal human liver, and is
also expressed in lymphocytes of HC patients and in MOLT-4 human
T-lymphoid cells.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the SRRD gene to chromosome 22q12.1 based on an
alignment of the SRRD sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC066962) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

609959	TITLE *609959 MYELOID-ASSOCIATED DIFFERENTIATION MARKER; MYADM
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display analysis, Pettersson et al. (2000) identified
mouse myeloid-associated differentiation marker (Myadm) based upon its
varied expression during differentiation of an Il3 (147740)-dependent
myeloid progenitor cell line established from mouse bone marrow. The
deduced protein contains 8 potential transmembrane domains and several
potential phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis on hematopoietic
cell lines revealed restricted expression of Myadm to cells belonging to
the myeloid lineage. Expression was also seen in mature granulocytes and
macrophages. Tissue analysis showed high expression of Myadm in lung and
more moderate expression in bone marrow and brain. RT-PCR experiments
demonstrated expression of Myadm in multipotent cells
(c-kit+Sca-1+Lin-), erythroid progenitors, and early lymphoid
progenitors.

By database searching with mouse Myadm as query, Cui et al. (2002)
identified human MYADM and cloned a full-length MYADM sequence from a
human bone marrow cDNA library. The deduced 298-amino acid protein has a
predicted molecular mass of 32 kD. It contains 7 predicted transmembrane
domains and shows sequence homology with the T-cell differentiation
protein MAL (188860) and plasmolipin (PLMP; 600340). MYADM shares 75.8%
overall sequence identity with mouse Myadm, with highest levels of
conservation seen in the predicted transmembrane regions. Northern blot
analysis detected 3.3- and 2.2-kb MYADM transcripts. Expression of the
longer transcript was seen in all tissues tested except thymus;
expression of the shorter transcript was seen in heart, placenta, lung,
pancreas, testis, and peripheral blood leukocytes and was undetectable
in all other tissues. Semiquantitative PCR assays showed that expression
of MYADM was not only significantly higher in peripheral blood
leukocytes than in bone marrow cells, but was also upregulated in NB4
cells (derived from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia) that
were treated with the differentiation inducer all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA).

GENE FUNCTION

Using antisense Myadm oligonucleotides, Pettersson et al. (2000) showed
that downregulation of mouse Myadm expression in pluripotent
hematopoietic progenitor cells inhibited colony formation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cui et al. (2002) determined that the MYADM gene contains 3 exons and
spans 7.1 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Cui et al. (2002) mapped the MYADM gene to
chromosome 19q13.33-q13.4.

190450	TITLE *190450 TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE 1; TPI1
;;TPI
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Triosephosphate isomerase (TPI; EC 5.3.1.1) catalyzes the
interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (summary by Ationu et al., 1999).

CLONING

Electrophoretic variants of triosephosphate isomerase were identified by
the Galton Laboratory group (Hopkinson and Harris, 1971).

Brown et al. (1985) isolated the functional gene and 3 intronless
pseudogenes for human TPI from a recombinant DNA library. The
pseudogenes share a high degree of homology with the functional gene but
contain mutations that preclude synthesis of active TPI enzyme. Sequence
divergence indicated origin of the pseudogenes about 18 million years
ago. Brown et al. (1985) concluded that the human TPI gene family has
only 1 functional gene.

Yuan et al. (1979), on the basis of structural analysis, concluded that
the TPI-A and TPI-B isozymes are products of distinct structural loci.
Decker and Mohrenweiser (1981) presented evidence that triosephosphate
isomerase isozymes are the expression of a single structural locus. (The
existence of 2 TPI loci, both probably coded by chromosome 12, had been
suggested to explain the observed isozyme patterns.) They identified a
rare electrophoretic variant and found that the variant phenotype was
expressed in the TPI-B isozyme of both red cells and circulating
lymphocytes and was also expressed in the TPI-A isozyme of
mitogen-stimulated lymphoblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

TPI is a dimeric enzyme of identical subunits that is characterized by a
high constitutive level of activity in all tissues. It is involved in
both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, catalyzing the interconversion of
DHAP and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. TPI is one of the most efficient
enzymes known, enhancing proton transfer by a factor of 10(10), and is
the least rate-limiting step in glycolysis (summary by Watanabe et al.,
1996).

GENE STRUCTURE

Brown et al. (1985) found that the functional TPI1 gene spans 3.5 kb and
is split into 7 exons.

MAPPING

From study of 3 patients with different deletions of chromosome 12,
Rethore et al. (1976, 1977) concluded that the GAPD locus (138400) is on
the distal part of 12p, between 12p12.2 and 12pter, and that the LDHB
locus (150100) is on the middle third between 12p12.1 and 12p12.2. The
results for TPI were like those for GAPD, suggesting the same distal
localization.

Law and Kao (1978) summarized data suggesting the order
12pter--TPI--GAPD--SHMT (SHMT2; 138450) on chromosome 12. SHMT lies on
the proximal part of 12q between the centromere and PEPB (169900).

Brown et al. (1985) confirmed that the functional TPI gene is on
chromosome 12 whereas the pseudogenes are on other chromosomes.

Asakawa and Iida (1985) also found support for a single TPI locus. GPI
(172400) and PEPD (613230), which are on chromosome 19 in man, are on
chromosome 9 of the Chinese hamster, and TPI, which is on chromosome 12
of man, is on Chinese hamster chromosome 8 (Siciliano et al., 1983).

OTHER FEATURES

TPI was 1 of 4 representative 'ancient' proteins used by Stoltzfus et
al. (1994) to test the exon theory of genes. Spliceosomal introns are
present in the nuclear protein-coding genes of most eukaryotic
organisms, but they have not been detected in several eukaryotic protist
phyla or in eubacteria, archaebacteria, and organelles. Two major
theories had emerged in the continuing debate on the origin of these
introns. The exon theory of genes (sometimes called the introns-early
view) proposed that exons are the descendants of ancient mini-genes and
introns are the descendants of the spaces between them; genes large
enough to encode contemporary proteins were first assembled from sets of
exons; the machinery of splicing originated in an ancient RNA world; and
introns were lost completely from both kingdoms of bacteria as well as
several protist groups. In contrast, the insertional theory of intron
origin (also known as the introns-late view) holds that split genes
arise from uninterrupted genes by insertion of introns; genes large
enough to encode contemporary proteins first arose (presumably from
smaller genes) without the participation of introns; the machinery of
spliceosomal splicing arose from fragmented self-splicing introns; and
spliceosomal introns were never present in the ancestors of those
organisms that now lack them. The analysis performed by Stoltzfus et al.
(1994) on TPI, the globins, pyruvate kinase, and alcohol dehydrogenase
demonstrated no significant correspondence between exons and units of
protein structure, suggesting that the putative correspondence does not
exist and that the exon theory of genes is untenable.

The chicken-and-egg question of which came first--exons or introns--was
studied, using TPI as a model, also by Kwiatowski et al. (1995) and
Logsdon et al. (1995). Each group looked at the positions of introns in
homologous TPI genes from a number of phylogenetically diverse species.
Both groups concluded that introns were gained comparatively recently in
eukaryotic evolution by insertion into preexisting genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Eber et al. (1979) identified 5 persons heterozygous for a TPI null
allele.

Maquat et al. (1985) concluded that the genetic basis of TPI deficiency
is heterogeneous: normal levels of TPI mRNA were found in 1 homozygote
and about 40% of normal in another. The rare homozygous deficient
persons usually have 3 to 10% of normal enzyme activity.

Daar et al. (1986) and Pekrun et al. (1995) identified homoygosity for a
glu104-to-asp (E104D; 190450.0001) mutation in the TPI1 gene in patients
with triosephosphate deficiency. Arya et al. (1997) found that among 7
unrelated Northern European kindreds with clinical TPI deficiency, the
glu104-to-asp mutation accounted for 11 of 14 (79%) mutant alleles.
Haplotype analysis supported a founder effect.

Studies by Boyer et al. (1989) and Boyer and Maquat (1990) identified
several sequences in the 5-prime region that appear to be required for
maintenance of normal levels of gene expression. These include a CAP
proximal element (CPE) spanning nucleotides -6 and -12. The -5A-G and
-8G-A substitutions identified by Watanabe et al. (1996) are located
within the CPE region. The observation that all 7 affected individuals
shared the same variant CPE allele, an allele that does not exist at
higher frequency in the general African American population, suggested
to the authors a common origin for this TPI-deficiency allele; how the
allele frequency is maintained at such a high level was unclear.

Watanabe et al. (1996) undertook the molecular characterization of the
variant alleles from 7 African American and 3 Caucasian individuals from
the unrelated group identified in the frequency studies. In Caucasians
they found 3 amino acid substitutions, all in residues that are not
directly involved in the enzyme's active site but are highly conserved
through evolutionary time, suggesting important roles for these residues
in maintenance of subunit structure and conformation. One of the amino
acid substitutions, glu104-to-asp (190450.0001), had been previously
identified in cases of hemolytic anemia due to TPI deficiency. The
variant allele in the 7 African American individuals had nucleotide
changes at positions -8 and -5 on the 5-prime side of the
transcription-initiation site.

In a study of 424 African American subjects and 75 white subjects,
Schneider et al. (1998) found that the -5 (592A-G), -8 (382G-A), and -24
(573T-G) variants in the triosephosphate isomerase gene occurred
frequently (41%) in the African American subjects but did not occur in
whites. These data suggested that this set of polymorphisms may be one
of the higher-incidence molecular markers of African lineage. Although
the variant substitutions (occurring in 3 haplotypes: -5 alone, -5 -8,
and -5 -8 -24) were associated with moderate reduction in enzyme
activity, severe deficiency heterozygotes could not be identified with
certainty, and none of the haplotypes was restricted to subjects with
marked reduction of enzyme activity. Three subjects were homozygous for
the -5 -8 haplotype, a finding inconsistent with the putative role of
this haplotype as the cause of a null variant incompatible with life in
homozygotes, as had been suggested in the past for the rarity of
homozygotes with TPI deficiency in African Americans. Despite these
findings, Schneider et al. (1998) admitted the possibility that the -5
-8 or -5 -8 -24 haplotypes may in some instances contribute to compound
heterozygosity and clinical TPI deficiency.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gnerer et al. (2006) identified a recessive hypomorphic mutation in
Drosophila, which they called 'wasted away' (wstd), that causes
progressive motor impairment, vacuolar neuropathology, and severely
reduced life span. They found that wstd was caused by a mutation in the
Tpi1 gene. The mutation did not result in a significant deficit in ATP,
and the authors suggested that the lack of TPI1 activity may cause the
accumulation of toxic metabolites upstream of the enzymatic block.

HISTORY

From studies in the cri-du-chat syndrome (123450), Sparkes et al. (1969)
suggested that the TPI locus is on the short arm of chromosome 5. Others
failed to confirm this (Brock and Singer, 1970). Cell hybridization
studies indicated that the TPI locus is on chromosome 12.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, GLU104ASP

In 2 unrelated patients with TPI deficiency (615512), Daar et al. (1986)
found a guanine-to-cytosine transversion in the codon for amino acid
104, resulting in a structurally altered protein in which a glutamate
residue was replaced by an aspartate residue. The importance of
glutamate-104 to enzyme structure and function was indicated by its
conservation in the TPI protein of all species characterized to date.
The glutamate-to-aspartate substitution resulted in a thermolabile
enzyme. The same mutation was identified in an Australian family by
Chang et al. (1993). The alteration of codon 104 was from GAG to GAC.

Pekrun et al. (1995) found this same mutation in a family with severe
TPI deficiency. The 1-year-old index patient suffered from hemolytic
anemia, neuromuscular impairment, and recurrent pneumonia, with the
necessity of intermittent mechanical ventilation. TPI activity in red
cells was reduced to about 20% of normal. Heat stability of the enzyme
was strongly reduced; concentration of the physiologic substrate,
dihydroxyacetone phosphate, was increased 20-fold due to the metabolic
block. During a second pregnancy, examination of a cord blood sample
obtained in the nineteenth gestational week showed that the infant was
homozygous normal. An unaffected, healthy newborn was delivered. The
parents were consanguineous and of Turkish origin.

Arya et al. (1997) found that among 7 unrelated Northern European
kindreds with clinical TPI deficiency, the glu104-to-asp mutation
accounted for 11 (79%) of 14 mutant alleles. In 3 families, molecular
analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for glu104 to asp and novel
missense mutations (see 190450.0004 and 190450.0005). The origin of the
glu104-to-asp mutation was defined by haplotype analysis using a novel
G/A polymorphism at nucleotide 2898 of the TPI gene. Cosegregation of
the low frequency 2898A allele with the G-to-C base change at nucleotide
315, responsible for the glu104-to-asp amino acid substitution,
supported a single origin for that mutation, i.e., founder effect.

.0002
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE MANCHESTER
TPI-MANCHESTER
TPI1, GLY122ARG

In a screening of more than 3,400 persons in an Ann Arbor, Michigan,
population, Perry and Mohrenweiser (1992) found only 1 example of a TPI
electromorph variant. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA products and subsequent
direct sequencing identified a G-to-A transition causing a replacement
of gly122 with arg in this electrophoretic mobility variant of TPI which
was referred to as TPI-Manchester. The substitution was at the amino
terminus or solvent interaction end of the fifth beta sheet of the
alpha/beta barrel structure. TPI-Manchester was found to be thermolabile
but the stability of the variant enzyme was not sensitive to other
denaturants.

.0003
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI-HUNGARY
TPI1, PHE240LEU

In a Hungarian family, Chang et al. (1993) found that the proband with
TPI deficiency (615512), who had chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia
but no neuromuscular disabilities, was a genetic compound. One of the
mutations was a missense mutation within codon 240 that changed TTC
(phe) to CTC (leu) and created a thermolabile protein. The substitution
occurred in a phylogenetically conserved amino acid and affected enzyme
activity by disrupting intersubunit contacts or substrate binding, as
deduced from enzyme structural studies. The nature of the other mutation
was not identified (see 190450.0006), but it had the effect of reducing
the abundance of TPI mRNA 10- to 20-fold. The same family was also
reported by Hollan et al. (1993) who gave clinical details on the
13-year-old boy with congenital hemolytic anemia and hyperkinetic
torsion dyskinesia associated with severe TPI deficiency, and on his
brother, a 23-year-old amateur wrestler, who also had congenital
hemolytic anemia but no neurologic symptoms. The latter was the proband
in the study of Chang et al. (1993), which demonstrated compound
heterozygosity. (Hollan et al. (1993) incorrectly referred to the
brothers as being double heterozygotes.) Both had less than 10% TPI
activity and a greatly increased dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) level
in their red blood cells. Their TPI had a slow electrophoretic mobility
and was heat unstable. Both parents and a third brother were healthy
heterozygotes. The older brother represented a unique phenotype since
all published homozygotes had severe neurologic alterations from infancy
or early childhood except 1 infant who died at 11 months, probably too
young for neurologic symptoms to be noted. Furthermore, in contrast to
the 2 affected Hungarian brothers, all but 1 homozygote had died before
the age of 6 years.

.0004
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, CYS41TYR

In 2 families with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency (615512), Arya
et al. (1997) found compound heterozygosity for the common glu104-to-asp
mutation (190450.0001) and a previously unknown missense mutation, cys41
to tyr, due to a TGT-to-TAT transition.

.0005
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, ILE170VAL

In a family with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency (615512), Arya et
al. (1997) found that affected individuals showed compound
heterozygosity for the common glu104-to-asp substitution (190450.0001)
and a novel ile170-to-val missense mutation.

.0006
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, GLU145TER

In a Hungarian family with severe TPI deficiency (615512) originally
described by Chang et al. (1993), Orosz et al. (2001) analyzed 2
germline-identical but phenotypically different brothers who were
compound heterozygotes for the F240L mutation (190450.0003) and a
glu145-to-ter (E145X) mutation. The kinetic, thermodynamic, and
associative properties of the recombinant human wildtype and F240L
mutant enzymes were compared with those of TPIs in normal and deficient
erythrocyte hemolysates. The specific activity of the recombinant mutant
enzyme relative to the wildtype was much higher (30%) than expected from
the activity (3%) measured in hemolysates. Comparative studies of the
hemolysate from a British patient with glu104-to-asp (190450.0001)
homozygosity (Ationu et al., 1999) and the platelet lysates from the
Hungarian family suggested that the microcompartmentation of TPI is not
unique for the hemolysates from the Hungarian TPI-deficient brothers.

615165	TITLE *615165 AKIRIN 2; AKIRIN2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Akirins, such as AKIRIN2, are conserved nuclear factors involved in
innate immune responses (Goto et al., 2008). Studies in worm suggest
that Akirins may also be involved in key events of meiotic prophase I
(Clemons et al., 2013).

CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of Drosophila Akirin, Goto et al.
(2008) identified human AKIRIN1 (615164) and AKIRIN2. They also
identified 2 Akirin homologs in zebrafish, frog, and mouse, but only 1
copy was present in chicken and insects. Akirin homologs were not found
in plants, yeast, and bacteria. The authors chose the name Akirin from
the Japanese 'akiraka ni suru,' meaning 'making things clear.' All
Akirin proteins contain an N-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS)
and show highest conservation in the N- and C-terminal regions. Both
human AKIRIN1 and AKIRIN2 exhibited NLS-dependent nuclear localization
in transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RNA interference and epistatic analyses, Goto et al. (2008) showed
that Akirin functioned downstream of the immune deficiency pathway in
Drosophila and was required for defense against gram-negative bacteria.
Human AKIRIN2 could rescue Akirin loss of function in Drosophila cells.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the AKIRIN2 gene to chromosome 6q15 based on an
alignment of the AKIRIN2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC000764) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Goto et al. (2008) found that Akirin2 deficiency was embryonic lethal in
mice. In contrast, Akirin1 -/- mice were born at the expected mendelian
ratio and showed no developmental defects. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEFs) lacking Akirin1, but not those lacking Akirin2, produced Il6
(147620) in response to stimulation with TLR ligands, Tnf (191160), or
Il1b (147720). Further analysis of Akirin2 -/- MEFs showed that Akirin2
acted together with or downstream of NF-kappa-B (see 164011) in the
control of TLR- and Il1b-inducible gene expression. Goto et al. (2008)
concluded that AKIRIN2, but not AKIRIN1, has an essential function
downstream of the TLR, TNF, and IL1B signaling pathways leading to
production of IL6.

Clemons et al. (2013) found that worms lacking Akir1, which shares about
30% amino acid identity with both vertebrate Akirins, showed defective
removal of synaptonemal complex (SC) proteins from chromosomes. Early
meiotic events, such as SC assembly and crossover formation, were normal
in mutant worms, but late prophase I events, such as SC disassembly,
chromosome condensation, and bivalent restructuring, were perturbed.
Clemons et al. (2013) concluded that Akirins are involved in regulated
mechanisms to prevent aberrant accumulation of SC proteins after their
removal from chromosomes during SC disassembly.

;;PROTEIN TYROSINE KINASE 9-LIKE; PTK9L;;
A6-RELATED PROTEIN; A6RP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the catalytic domain of rat Pkc-zeta (176982) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen, Rohwer et al. (1999) cloned PTK9L, which they called
A6RP, from a human keratinocyte cell line cDNA library. The deduced
349-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 39.5 kD. PTK9L
contains a consensus sequence for actin-depolymerizing proteins and 2
ATP-binding motifs. It shares 64% amino acid identity with the human A6
protein (PTK9), 97% identity with mouse Ptk9l, 34% identity with C.
elegans A6, and 26% identity with yeast twinfilin (see 610932). RT-PCR
and Western blot analysis detected PTK9L in all human and mouse tissues
and cells tested. Immunofluorescence localization revealed spotty
accumulation of PTK9L in the cytoplasm close to nuclei.

GENE FUNCTION

Rohwer et al. (1999) found that PTK9L was phosphorylated by PKC-zeta,
but not significantly by other PKC isoenzymes. It was also
phosphorylated by casein kinase II (see 115442) and most effectively by
the tyrosine kinase SRC (190090). In accordance with its potential
ATP-binding site, PTK9L was able to bind ATP.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PTK9L
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP stSG1676).

162096	TITLE *162096 MIDKINE; MDK
;;MIDGESTATION AND KIDNEY; MK;;
NEURITE GROWTH-PROMOTING FACTOR 2, FORMERLY; NEGF2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Midkine is a retinoic acid-responsive, heparin-binding growth factor
expressed in various cell types during embryogenesis. It promotes
angiogenesis, cell growth, and cell migration. Midkine is also expressed
in several carcinomas, suggesting that it may play a role in
tumorigenesis, perhaps through its effects on angiogenesis (summary by
Reynolds et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using mouse Mk to screen a midgestation human embryonic kidney cDNA
library, followed by screening a placenta genomic library, Tsutsui et
al. (1991) cloned human MDK, which they called MK. The deduced 121-amino
acid protein has a signal sequence and shares 87% identity with mouse
Mk. Orthologs of MK were detected in rat, cow, and chicken. The chicken
ortholog, Rihb, is a retinoic acid-induced heparin-binding protein. MK
shares about 50% amino acid homology with the human heparin-binding
protein pleiotrophin (PTN; 162095), with highest conservation in the
central part of the molecule and complete conservation of cysteine
residues. Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of about 1 kb in
adult human kidney and PA1 human teratocarcinoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Reynolds et al. (2004) found that hypoxia induced midkine expression in
alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary vasculature in a strain of mice
sensitive to hypoxia. Hypoxia induced expression of both HIF1-alpha
(603348) and midkine in human placental adenocarcinoma, mouse fetal lung
mesenchyme, and human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell lines. HIF1-alpha
induced midkine expression via regulatory elements in the mouse midkine
promoter. Chronic expression of midkine during embryonic development in
transgenic mice resulted in pulmonary arterial remodeling and
muscularization, but only during the postnatal phase of lung
development. In fetal mouse lung mesenchymal cells and transgenic mice,
midkine upregulated expression of myocardin (MYOCD; 606127), a regulator
of smooth muscle cell differentiation.

Intraperitoneal adhesions between organs or between organs and
peritoneal walls occur in more than 90% of cases involving major
abdominal operations. Using a model of postoperative adhesions and
Mk-null mice, Inoh et al. (2004) showed that midkine was fundamentally
involved in the formation of intraperitoneal adhesions, at least partly
by promoting migration of macrophages and neutrophils to the omentum.

Hobo et al. (2009) found that 5/6 nephrectomy in mice, a model of
chronic kidney disease, induced expression of midkine in lung, leading
to elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; 106180) activity and
plasma angiotensin II (106150) levels and subsequent hypertension.
Exposure to midkine enhanced ACE expression in primary cultured human
lung microvascular endothelial cells. Oxidative stress may have
contributed to midkine expression, since 5/6 nephrectomy induced
expression of NADH/NADPH oxidase-1 (NOX1; 300225), Nox2 (CYBB; 300481),
and Nox4 (605261). Furthermore, an antioxidant reduced midkine
expression and plasma angiotensin II levels and ameliorated hypertension
in 5/6 nephrectomized mice.

GENE STRUCTURE

Uehara et al. (1992) determined that the MDK gene contains 4 exons. The
5-prime flanking region adjacent to the start site contains 5 GC boxes,
a steroid/thyroid hormone receptor-binding site, and an A/T-rich island,
but there is no obvious CAAT box. Further upstream there is a region
with high GC content. The mouse Mdk gene has a similar organization,
with conservation of exons and significant homology in the 5-prime
region adjacent to the start site. There are 3 additional regions of
homology between mouse and human MDK in the 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, Eddy et al. (1991) demonstrated that
the MDK gene segregates concordantly with chromosome 11 and, using cell
hybrids carrying translocations involving chromosome 11, they mapped the
gene regionally to 11p13-p11. Kaname et al. (1993) mapped the MDK gene
to human chromosome 11p11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Simon-Chazottes et al. (1992) mapped the mouse Mdk gene to chromosome 2,
using an interspecific backcross panel and microsatellite polymorphisms
as markers. O'Hara et al. (1995) used somatic cell hybrid analysis and
interspecific backcross analysis, respectively, to map human Mdk to
chromosome 11p13-p11 and mouse Mdk to a syntenic region of mouse
chromosome 2. They also mapped an Mdk pseudogene to mouse chromosome 11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using microarray analysis, Ezquerra et al. (2005) found that aortae of
Mk -/- mice showed elevated expression of renin (REN; 179820),
angiotensinogen (106150), angiotensin II receptor-1 (AGTR1; 106165), and
angiotensin II receptor-2 (AGTR2; 300034) and decreased expression of
Ace.

600365	TITLE *600365 ACTIVE BCR-RELATED GENE; ABR
DESCRIPTION Heisterkamp et al. (1989) described an active BCR-related gene (ABR)
that they identified based on its homology with the BCR gene (151410)
located on chromosome 22. BCR is involved in reciprocal translocations
with the ABL oncogene (189980) on chromosome 9 in Philadelphia
chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia. Heisterkamp et al.
(1993) mapped the ABR gene to 17p13.3 by in situ hybridization
techniques. McDonald et al. (1994) found that the ABR locus was deleted
in 7 of 8 informative cases of medulloblastoma. Using pulsed field gel
electrophoresis, they localized a polymorphic marker of the ABR gene to
within 220 kb of D17S34. A cosmid contig constructed in this region was
used to demonstrate by fluorescence in situ hybridization that the
5-prime to 3-prime transcriptional orientation of the ABR gene is toward
the telomere.

602366	TITLE *602366 INTEGRIN-LINKED KINASE; ILK
;;p59
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ILK is a serine-threonine protein kinase that associates with the
cytoplasmic domain of beta integrins and acts as a proximal receptor
kinase regulating integrin-mediated signal transduction (Melchior et
al., 2002).

CLONING

Transduction of extracellular matrix signals through integrins
influences intracellular and extracellular functions, and appears to
require interaction of integrin cytoplasmic domains with cellular
proteins. Using a 2-hybrid screen, Hannigan et al. (1996) isolated from
a placenta cDNA library a gene that interacts with the cytoplasmic
domain of beta-1 integrin (135630). The gene, designated integrin-linked
kinase (ILK), encodes a predicted 451-amino acid protein with an
apparent molecular mass of 59 kD based on SDS-PAGE. Northern blot
analysis showed that the 1.8-kb ILK mRNA is widely expressed. The ILK
protein is a serine/threonine protein kinase with 4 ankyrin-like
repeats.

Melchior et al. (2002) cloned the human ILK gene. The deduced 452-amino
acid protein has 4 N-terminal ankyrin repeats, followed by a pleckstrin
homology domain and a C-terminal kinase catalytic domain composed of 11
subdomains.

By immunofluorescence analysis on cryosections of wildtype mouse hearts,
White et al. (2006) detected ILK protein in a pattern consistent with
that of the Z-bands and costameres of cardiomyocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Melchior et al. (2002) determined that the ILK gene contains 13 exons
and spans 9.0 kb. The ATG codon is located within exon 2. Intron 2 is
more than 3.6 kb long and has an Alu-like repeat sequence. The promoter
region has characteristics typical of housekeeping genes, such as high
GC content, the presence of CpG islands, lack of TATA and CAAT boxes,
and the presence of multiple transcription initiation start sites.

MAPPING

Hannigan et al. (1997) mapped the ILK gene to 11p15.5-p15.4 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Hannigan et al. (1996) found that ILK coimmunoprecipitated with beta-1
integrin from cell lysates, and that overexpression of ILK disrupted
cell architecture and inhibited adhesion to integrin substrates, while
inducing anchorage-independent growth in epithelial cells, suggesting
that ILK regulates integrin-mediated signal transduction.

By knockout of the ILK gene in human embryonic kidney cells and mouse
macrophages, Troussard et al. (2003) showed that ILK is essential for
regulation of AKT (see AKT1; 164730) activity. ILK knockout had no
effect on phosphorylation of AKT on thr308, but resulted in almost
complete inhibition of phosphorylation on ser473, causing significant
inhibition of AKT activity accompanied by significant stimulation of
apoptosis. ILK knockout also suppressed phosphorylation of GSK3B
(605004) on ser9 and cyclin D1 (168461) expression. Troussard et al.
(2003) concluded that ILK is an essential upstream regulator of AKT
activation.

Fukuda et al. (2003) found that PINCH1 (LIMS1; 602567) and ILK are
essential for prompt HeLa cell spreading and motility following passage,
and that they are crucial for cell survival. While ILK depletion reduced
AKT phosphorylation on ser473, PINCH1 depletion reduced AKT
phosphorylation on both ser473 and thr308. PINCH1 also regulated ILK
protein levels. Fukuda et al. (2003) concluded that PINCH1 is an
obligate partner of ILK and both are indispensable for proper control of
cell shape change, motility, and survival.

Bock-Marquette et al. (2004) demonstrated that the G-actin sequestering
peptide thymosin beta-4 (300159) promoted myocardial and endothelial
cell migration in the embryonic heart and retained this property in
postnatal cardiomyocytes. Survival of embryonic and postnatal
cardiomyocytes in culture was also enhanced by thymosin beta-4. Thymosin
beta-4 formed a functional complex with PINCH1 and ILK, resulting in
activation of the survival kinase AKT, also known as protein kinase B.
After coronary artery ligation in mice, thymosin beta-4 treatment
resulted in upregulation of Ilk and Akt activity in the heart, enhanced
early myocyte survival, and improved cardiac function. Bock-Marquette et
al. (2004) concluded that thymosin beta-4 promotes cardiomyocyte
migration, survival, and repair.

Lu et al. (2006) demonstrated a marked increase in ILK protein levels in
hypertrophic ventricles of patients with congenital and acquired outflow
tract obstruction. The increase in ILK was associated with the
activation of Rho family guanine triphosphatases, RAC1 (602048) and
CDC42 (116952), and known hypertrophic signaling kinases, including
extracellular signal-related kinases, such as ERK1/2 (see 601795) and
p70-S6-kinase (RPS6KB1; 608938). Transgenic mice with cardiac-specific
expression of a constitutively active or wildtype ILK exhibited a
compensated ventricular hypertrophic phenotype and displayed an
activation profile of guanine triphosphatases and downstream protein
kinases concordant with that seen in human hypertrophy. In contrast,
transgenic mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted expression of a
kinase-inactive ILK were unable to mount a compensatory hypertrophic
response to angiogensin II (see 106150) in vivo. Lu et al. (2006)
concluded that ILK-regulated signaling represents a broadly adaptive
hypertrophic response mechanism relevant to a wide range of clinical
heart disease.

Using a forward genetic screen in zebrafish to identify novel genes
required for myocardial function, Knoll et al. (2007) identified the
lost-contact (loc) mutant, which has a nonsense mutation in the ilk
gene. The loc/ilk mutant is associated with a severe defect in
cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells that leads to severe myocardial
dysfunction.

In primary cultures of human fetal myocardial cells, Traister et al.
(2012) observed that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of ILK potently
increased the number of new aggregates of primitive cardioblasts. The
number of cardioblast colonies was significantly decreased when ILK
expression was knocked down with ILK-targeted siRNA. Overexpression of
an activation-resistant ILK mutant, R211A, resulted in a much greater
increase in the number of new cell aggregates compared to wildtype. The
cardiomyogenic effects of both wildtype and mutant ILK were accompanied
by concurrent activation of beta-catenin (116806) and increased
expression of progenitor cell marker islet-1 (ISL1; 600366), which was
also observed in lysates of transgenic mice with cardiac-specific
overexpression of the R211A mutant and wildtype ILK. Endogenous ILK
expression was shown to increase in concert with those of cardiomyogenic
markers during directed cardiomyogenic differentiation in human
embryonic stem cells. Traister et al. (2012) concluded that ILK
represents a regulatory checkpoint in human cardiomyogenesis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Knoll et al. (2007) sequenced the ILK gene in 192 Caucasian individuals
with severe dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD; see 115200) and identified a
heterozygous missense mutation in 1 patient (A262V; 602366.0001) that
was not found in 712 controls.

ANIMAL MODEL

Sakai et al. (2003) found that embryonic mice lacking Ilk expression
died at the periimplantation stage due to failure of epiblast
polarization and cavitation. The impaired epiblast polarization was
associated with abnormal F-actin accumulation at sites of integrin
attachment to the basement membrane zone. Likewise, Ilk-deficient
fibroblasts showed abnormal F-actin aggregates associated with impaired
cell spreading and delayed formation of stress fibers and focal
adhesions. Ilk-deficient fibroblasts also had diminished proliferation
rates. The proliferation defect was not due to absent or reduced
Ilk-mediated phosphorylation of Akt or Gsk3b. Expression of mutant Ilk
lacking kinase activity and/or paxillin (602505) binding in
Ilk-deficient fibroblasts rescued cell spreading, F-actin organization,
focal adhesion formation, and proliferation.

Friedrich et al. (2004) found that endothelial cell-specific deletion of
Ilk in mice conferred placental insufficiency with decreased
labyrinthine vascularization, and yielded no viable offspring. Deletion
of Ilk in zebrafish resulted in marked patterning abnormalities of the
vasculature and was similarly lethal. Phenotypic rescue of Ilk-deficient
mouse lung endothelial cells with wildtype Ilk, but not by a
constitutively active mutant of Akt, suggested that regulation of
endothelial cell survival by ILK is independent of AKT.

The recessive 'main squeeze' (msq) mutation in zebrafish is embryonic
lethal due to heart failure. Bendig et al. (2006) found that
stretch-responsive genes, such as atrial natriuretic factor (ANF;
108780) and Vegf (192240), were downregulated in msq mutant hearts.
Through positional cloning, they found that heart failure in msq mutants
was due to a point mutation in the Ilk gene. In normal hearts, Ilk
specifically localized to costameres and sarcomeric Z discs. The msq
mutation reduced Ilk kinase activity and disrupted binding of Ilk to the
Z disc adaptor protein beta-parvin (PARVB; 608121). In msq mutant
embryos, heart failure could be suppressed by expression of Ilk or
constitutively active forms of Akt and Vegf. Antisense-mediated
abrogation of zebrafish beta-parvin phenocopied the msq phenotype.

White et al. (2006) performed targeted ablation of Ilk expression in the
mouse heart and observed spontaneous cardiomyopathy and heart failure by
6 weeks of age. The murine symptoms reflected classic human symptoms of
dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD; see 115200), with labored breathing, lack
of strength, and sudden death; postmortem examination revealed grossly
enlarged hearts in all animals, with dramatically dilated left
ventricular chambers and evidence of fibrosis on histology.
Immunofluorescence analysis of frozen heart sections from the mutant
mice revealed loss of Ilk from the sarcolemma, resulting in
disaggregation of adjacent cardiomyocytes within the heart tissue;
trichrome staining confirmed the dramatic disaggregation in mutant mice
compared to the compact arrangement of cardiomyocytes in controls.
Deletion of Ilk was associated with disruption of adhesion signaling
through the beta-1 integrin (135630)/Fak (PTK2; 600758) complex, and
loss of Ilk was accompanied by a reduction in cardiac Akt (164730)
phosphorylation, which normally provides a protective response against
stress. White et al. (2006) suggested that ILK plays a central role in
protecting the mammalian heart against cardiomyopathy and failure.

Lange et al. (2009) showed that mice carrying point mutations in the
proposed autophosphorylation site of the putative kinase domain and in
the pleckstrin homology domain of Ilk are normal. In contrast, mice with
point mutations in the conserved lysine residue of the potential
ATP-binding site of the kinase domain, which mediates Ilk binding to
alpha-parvin (608120), die owing to renal agenesis. Similar renal
defects occur in alpha-parvin-null mice. Lange et al. (2009) concluded
that their results provided genetic evidence that the kinase activity of
Ilk is dispensable for mammalian development; however, an interaction
between Ilk and alpha-parvin is critical for kidney development.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
ILK, ALA262VAL

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to dilated cardiomyopathy (see 115200) has not been
confirmed.

In a Caucasian man with severe dilated cardiomyopathy who had been
diagnosed at 54 years of age and had an ejection fraction of only 25%,
Knoll et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a 785C-T transition in
the ILK gene, resulting in an ala262-to-val (A262V) substitution at a
highly conserved residue in a proline-rich region of the ILK kinase
domain. In vitro kinase assay revealed a 63% reduction in kinase
activity for the A262V variant compared to wildtype.
Immunohistochemistry on a myocardial biopsy sample from the patient
showed a significant loss of endothelial cells.

;;ROPPORIN;;
OUTER DENSE FIBER OF SPERM TAILS 6; ODF6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis with rhophilin (601031) as bait, followed by
RACE-PCR of a mouse testis cDNA library, Fujita et al. (2000) cloned
mouse Ropn1. The deduced 212-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 24 kD. The N-terminal 40-amino acid sequence of Ropn1
showed high homology to that of the regulatory subunit of type II
cAMP-dependent protein kinase (see 188830). Yeast 2-hybrid assay and gel
filtration indicated that Ropn1 homodimerizes through this domain.
Deletion analysis showed that the C-terminal 4 amino acids are essential
for binding of ropporin to rhophilin. Northern blot analysis of mouse
tissues showed that Ropn1 was expressed in testis only and induced at
the late stage of spermatogenesis, similar to rhophilin. Ropn1 and Rho
(165390) coprecipitated in the presence of rhophilin in vitro.
Immunocytochemistry showed that ropporin was localized in the principal
piece and the end piece of sperm flagella. Electron microscopy revealed
that ropporin was mostly localized in the inner surface of the fibrous
sheath, while rhophilin was present in the outer surface of the outer
dense fiber. These results suggested that rhophilin and ropporin may
form a complex in sperm flagella.

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a human testis cDNA library using the
N-terminal fragment of AKAP110 (AKAP3; 604689) as bait, followed by
5-prime RACE of testis cDNA, Carr et al. (2001) cloned ROPN1. The
deduced ROPN1 protein shares 39% amino acid identity to ROPN1L (611756)
and 94% amino acid identity to mouse Ropn1. The N-terminal regions of
ROPN1L and ROPN1 share similarity with the N-terminus of 2
sperm-specific proteins, SPA17 (608621) and fibrousheathin II (CABYR;
612135). AKAP110 and Ropn1 colocalized in the principal piece of sperm
flagella, and Ropn1 also localized to the cytoplasmic droplet and
midpiece.

NOMENCLATURE

Fujita et al. (2000) designated this protein as ropporin, which stands
for rhophilin-associated 'oppo' (a Japanese word for tail) protein.

606248	TITLE *606248 QUINOLINATE PHOSPHORIBOSYLTRANSFERASE; QPRT
;;QPRTase
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Quinolinate is an intermediate in the de novo synthesis pathway of NAD
from tryptophan and acts as a potent endogenous excitotoxin through
hyperstimulation of N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in the neuron.
Elevation of quinolinate levels in the human brain has been postulated
to be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders.
Mammalian quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRTase; EC 2.4.2.19)
is a key enzyme in catabolism of quinolinate.

CLONING

Using partial amino acid sequences obtained from purified porcine kidney
QPRTase, Fukuoka et al. (1998) isolated a human isolog from a brain cDNA
library. QPRT encodes a predicted 297-amino acid protein with a
molecular mass of 30 kD. The QPRT protein has an N-terminal cleavable
signal sequence and shares 30 to 40% identity with bacterial QPRTases.
Fukuoka et al. (1998) hypothesized that QPRT is likely to be
translocated into the secretory pathway but retained within a certain
vesicular compartment. To confirm that they had cloned the human
QPRTase, Fukuoka et al. (1998) expressed a recombinant human QPRTase in
E. coli and detected enzymatic activity that rescued a QPRTase-defective
E. coli strain. They concluded that QPRT is functional beyond the
phylogenic boundary.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the QPRT
gene to chromosome 16.

;;DAG;;
DYSTROGLYCAN, ALPHA;;
AGRIN RECEPTOR; AGRNR
DYSTROGLYCAN, BETA, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The DAG1 gene encodes 2 dystroglycan proteins, both of which are
dystrophin-associated glycoproteins (DAGs). Dystrophin (DMD; 300377), a
large skeletal muscle protein localized to the inner surface of the
sarcolemma, is tightly linked to a large complex of glycoproteins that
comprise the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC). Alpha- and
beta-dystroglycan are parts of the DGC (Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al.,
1992).

Beta-dystroglycan is an integral membrane protein, whereas
alpha-dystroglycan is membrane-associated through its noncovalent
interaction with the extracellular domain of beta-dystroglycan. The
alpha- and beta-dystroglycans provide important physical linkages
between components of basement membranes and cytoplasmic proteins that
bind to the actin cytoskeleton (Spear, 1998).

CLONING

Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al. (1992) demonstrated that the transmembrane
43-kD and extracellular 156-kD DAG proteins are encoded by a single
5.8-kb mRNA. The deduced 895-residue precursor protein has a molecular
mass of 96 kD and undergoes posttranslational processing to generate a
43-kD transmembrane protein and a 156-kD extracellular protein. The
predicted amino acid sequence of human and rabbit dystroglycan are 93%
identical, with predicted glycosylation sites being conserved. Both
dystroglycan proteins were expressed in a variety of fetal and adult
tissues. The muscle and nonmuscle isoforms of dystroglycan differ by
carbohydrate moieties but not protein sequence.

GENE STRUCTURE

The coding sequence of the DAG1 gene is organized into 2 exons,
separated by a large intron (Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al., 1993).

MAPPING

Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al. (1992, 1993) mapped the DAG gene to
chromosome 3 by Southern blot analysis of human/Chinese hamster somatic
cell hybrid DNAs. The regional assignment to 3p21 was confirmed and
further refined by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Gorecki et al. (1994) demonstrated that the Dag1 gene is located on
mouse chromosome 9 in a region of conserved synteny with human 3p. The
location was consistent with a possibility that dystroglycan mutations
are involved in either of 2 mouse neurologic mutations, 'ducky' (du) or
'tippy' (tip).

GENE FUNCTION

Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al. (1992) demonstrated that the extracellular
156-kD DAG binds laminin, and thus may provide linkage between the
sarcolemma and extracellular matrix (ECM).

Agrin (103320) is a component of the synaptic basal lamina which induces
the aggregation of acetylcholine receptors and other elements of the
postsynaptic membrane. Ma et al. (1993) determined the localization,
binding characteristics, and biochemical profile of the agrin receptor
in Torpedo electric organ membranes and defined domains of agrin that
bind this receptor. Campanelli et al. (1994) and Gee et al. (1994)
presented evidence that the alpha-dystrophin-associated glycoprotein
functions as an agrin receptor. Utrophin (128240) colocalizes with
agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor clusters. Agrin may function by
initiating or stabilizing a synapse-specific membrane cytoskeleton that
in turn serves as a scaffold upon which synaptic molecules are
concentrated. Sealock and Froehner (1994) reviewed the evidence that
alpha-dystroglycan is an agrin-binding protein and the functional
implications of this.

Yamada et al. (1996) showed that dystroglycan is a dual receptor for
agrin and laminin-2 in the Schwann cell membrane. Laminin-2 is composed
of the alpha-2 (156225), beta-1 (150240), and gamma-1 (150290) laminin
chains.

Rambukkana et al. (1998) showed that alpha-DG serves as a Schwann cell
receptor for Mycobacterium leprae, the causative organism of leprosy.
They found that M. leprae specifically binds to alpha-DG only in the
presence of the G domain of the alpha-2 chain of laminin-2. Native
alpha-DG competitively inhibited the laminin-2-mediated M. leprae
binding to primary Schwann cells. Thus, M. leprae may use linkage
between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton through laminin-2
and alpha-DG for its interaction with Schwann cells. The neuropathy of
leprosy is caused, in part, by invasion of peripheral nerves by M.
leprae. The Schwann cell is an important target for bacterial invasion.
In the endoneurium of peripheral nerves, Schwann cells are covered by
basal lamina, composed of laminin, type IV collagen, entactin/nidogen,
and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Similarly, Cao et al. (1998) found
that alpha-DG serves as a receptor for lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus (LCMV) and for Lassa fever virus (LFV). They purified a peripheral
membrane protein that is interactive with LCMV from cells permissive to
infection by this virus. Tryptic peptides from this protein were
determined to be alpha-DG. Several strains of LCMV and other
arenaviruses, including LFV, Oliveros, and Mobala, bound to purified
alpha-DG protein. Soluble alpha-DG blocked both LCMV and LFV infection.
Cells bearing a null mutation of the gene encoding DG were resistant to
LCMV infection, and reconstitution of DG expression in null mutant cells
restored susceptibility to LCMV infection. Thus, alpha-DG is a cellular
receptor for both LCMV and LFV.

Spence et al. (2004) localized beta-dystroglycan to microvilli
structures in a number of cell types where it associated with the
cytoskeletal adaptor ezrin (VIL2; 123900), through which it was able to
modulate the actin cytoskeleton and induced peripheral filopodia and
microvilli. Ezrin was able to interact with dystroglycan through a
cluster of basic residues in the juxtamembrane region of dystroglycan,
and mutation of these residues both prevented ezrin binding and the
induction of actin-rich surface protrusions.

Wright et al. (2012) found that mouse dystroglycan bound directly to the
laminin G domain of the axonal guidance molecule Slit (see SLIT1,
603742) in a calcium-dependent manner. Binding to dystroglycan was
required for proper Slit localization within the basement membrane and
floor plate, and for development of normal commissural axon guidance
tracts. Mutations in mouse Ispd (614631) or B3gnt1 (605517) that
disrupted dystroglycan glycosylation resulted in similar abnormalities
in axonal pathfinding.

- Role in Muscular Dystrophy

Abnormal glycosylation of DAG1 results in several forms of congenital
muscular dystrophy that range phenotypically from severe forms with
brain and eye anomalies (see, e.g., MDDGA1; 236670) to milder
limb-girdle types (see, e.g., MDDGC1; 609308). Mutations in 6 different
genes involved in glycosylation of DAG1 have been identified; these
genes include POMT1 (607423), POMT2 (607439), POMGNT1 (606822), FKTN
(607440), FKRP (606596), and LARGE (603590). These disorders are
collectively known as 'dystroglycanopathies' (Godfrey et al., 2007).

Matsumura et al. (1993) demonstrated deficient expression of multiple
dystrophin-associated glycoproteins in a form of congenital muscular
dystrophy due to mutation in the FKTN gene (607440). This form of
congenital muscular dystrophy, also known as Fukuyama-type congenital
muscular dystrophy (FCMD) or muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy with
brain and eye anomalies (type A4; MDDGA4; 253800) is characterized by
defective glycosylation of DAG1. Matsumura et al. (1993) noted that the
156DAG/43DAG proteins are expressed in both muscle and brain.

Arahata et al. (1993) found preservation of immunostaining for 43DAG in
FCMD at the plasma membrane of the muscle fibers. On the other hand,
they found reduced laminin M (or merosin (156225), a striated
muscle-specific basal-lamina-associated protein) in most muscle fibers
of FCMD, suggesting that it may have an early or primary role in the
pathogenesis of the disorder.

Matsumura et al. (1993) showed that truncation of the dystrophin
molecule with loss of the C-terminal domains can lead to severe muscular
dystrophy, even when truncated dystrophin is demonstrable in the
subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton. This is because the C-terminal domains are
involved in the interaction with the large oligomeric complex of
sarcolemmal glycoproteins, including dystroglycan.

Tinsley et al. (1994) reviewed the 'increasing complexity of the
dystrophin-associated protein complex.' Although the exact function of
dystrophin remained to be determined, analysis of its interaction with
this large oligomeric protein complex at the sarcolemma and the
identification of a structurally related protein, utrophin (128240),
were leading to the identification of candidate genes for various
neuromuscular disorders.

As reviewed by Spear (1998), structural integrity of the sarcolemma in
skeletal and cardiac muscle appears to depend in part on binding of the
cytoplasmic protein dystrophin to both actin and the cytoplasmic tail of
beta-dystroglycan, and binding of alpha-dystroglycan to laminin-2 in the
basal lamina. Laminins are composed of 3 polypeptide chains designated
alpha, beta, and gamma. The multiple isoforms of laminin differ in their
constituent chains. Laminin-2 is composed of alpha-2, beta-1, and
gamma-1. Homozygous deletion of the gene encoding dystroglycan is lethal
at the embryonic stage in mice (Williamson et al., 1997) and would
presumably also be lethal in humans.

Yamada et al. (2001) demonstrated that a 30-kD fragment of
beta-dystroglycan is the product of proteolytic processing of the
extracellular domain of beta-dystroglycan by the membrane-associated
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP2; 120360). This processing disintegrates
the dystroglycan complex and disrupts this particular link between the
ECM and cell membrane. The authors proposed that this processing of
beta-dystroglycan may play a crucial role in the molecular pathogenesis
of sarcoglycanopathy.

Using PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunoblotting to analyze samples
from patients with Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy, Hayashi et
al. (2001) confirmed a deficiency of fukutin (FKTN; 607440) and found
marked deficiency of highly glycosylated DAG1 in skeletal and cardiac
muscle and reduced amounts of DAG1 in brain tissue. Beta-dystroglycan
was normal in all tissues examined. These findings supported the
suggestion that fukutin deficiency affects the modification of
glycosylation of DAG1, which then cannot localize or function properly
and may be degraded or eluted from the extracellular surface membrane of
the muscle fiber. Hayashi et al. (2001) concluded that this disruption
underlies the developmental, structural, and functional damage to
muscles in patients with FCMD.

Using transfection experiments, Esapa et al. (2002) determined that
fukutin and fukutin-related protein (FKRP; 606596) are targeted to the
medial Golgi apparatus through their N termini and transmembrane
domains. Overexpression of FKRP in CHO cells altered the
posttranslational processing of alpha- and beta-dystroglycan, thus
inhibiting maturation of the 2 isoforms. Mutations in the DxD motif or
in the Golgi-targeting sequence, which cause inefficient trafficking of
FKRP to the Golgi apparatus, did not alter dystroglycan processing in
vitro. The pro448-to-leu mutation in FKRP (P448L; 606596.0003) resulted
in mislocalization of the mutant protein and disruption in dystroglycan
processing. Esapa et al. (2002) concluded that FKRP is required for the
posttranslational modification of dystroglycan. They suggested that
aberrant processing of dystroglycan caused by a mislocalized FKRP mutant
could be a novel mechanism that causes congenital muscular dystrophy.

Kanagawa et al. (2004) showed that both the N-terminal domain and a
portion of the mucin-like domain of alpha-dystroglycan are essential for
high-affinity laminin receptor function. They found that
posttranslational modification of alpha-dystroglycan by LARGE (603590)
occurs within the mucin-like domain, but the N-terminal domain interacts
with LARGE, defining an intracellular enzyme-substrate recognition motif
necessary to initiate functional glycosylation. Gene replacement in
dystroglycan-deficient muscle demonstrated that the dystroglycan
C-terminal domain is sufficient only for dystrophin-glycoprotein complex
assembly. To prevent muscle degeneration, expression of a functional
dystroglycan through LARGE recognition and glycosylation was required.
The authors concluded that molecular recognition of dystroglycan by
LARGE is a key determinant in the biosynthetic pathway to produce mature
and functional dystroglycan.

Using mass spectrometry- and nuclear magnetic resonance-based structural
analyses, Yoshida-Moriguchi et al. (2010) identified a phosphorylated
O-mannosyl glycan on the mucin-like domain of recombinant alpha-DG,
which was required for laminin binding. Yoshida-Moriguchi et al. (2010)
demonstrated that patients with muscle-eye-brain disease (253280) and
Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (253800), as well as mice with
myodystrophy, commonly have defects in a postphosphoryl modification of
this phosphorylated O-linked mannose, and that this modification is
mediated by the LARGE protein. Yoshida-Moriguchi et al. (2010) concluded
that their findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms that
underlie congenital muscular dystrophy.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Turkish woman with limb-girdle muscular
dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy type C (MDDGC9; 613818) and severe
cognitive impairment reported by Dincer et al. (2003), Hara et al.
(2011) identified a homozygous mutation in the DAG1 gene (T192M;
128239.0001). Functional expression analysis in vitro and in mice
indicated that the mutation decreased LARGE (603590)-mediated
posttranslational O-mannosyl glycosylation of DAG1, interfering with its
receptor function and laminin binding in skeletal muscle and brain.

ANIMAL MODEL

Williamson et al. (1997) found that heterozygous Dag1-null mice were
viable and fertile. In contrast, homozygous embryos exhibited gross
developmental abnormalities beginning around 6.5 days' gestation. They
found that an early defect in the development of homozygous embryos was
a disruption of the Reichert membrane, an extra-embryonic basement
membrane. Consistent with the functional defects observed in Reichert
membrane, dystroglycan protein was localized in apposition to this
structure in normal egg cylinder-stage embryos. They also showed that
the localization of 2 critical structural elements of Reichert membrane,
laminin and collagen IV, were specifically disrupted in the homozygous
Dag1 embryos. The data indicated that dystroglycan is required for the
development of Reichert membrane and that disruption of basement
membrane organization is a common feature of muscular dystrophies linked
to the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex.

Henry and Campbell (1998) found that Dag1-null murine embryonic stem
cells had defective formation of basement membranes in embryoid bodies.
These results further indicated that dystroglycan-laminin interactions
are prerequisite for the deposition of other basement membrane proteins.
Dystroglycan may exert its influence on basement membrane assembly by
binding soluble laminin and organizing it on the cell surface.

Cote et al. (1999) reported that chimeric mice generated with ES cells
targeted for both dystroglycan alleles have skeletal muscles essentially
devoid of dystroglycans and develop a progressive muscle pathology with
changes emblematic of muscular dystrophies in humans. In addition, many
neuromuscular junctions are disrupted in these mice. The ultrastructure
of basement membranes and the deposition of laminin within them,
however, appears unaffected in dystroglycan-deficient muscles. Cote et
al. (1999) concluded that dystroglycans are necessary for myofiber
survival and synapse differentiation or stability, but not for the
formation of the muscle basement membrane, and that dystroglycans may
have more than a purely structural function in maintaining muscle
integrity.

Moore et al. (2002) showed that brain-selective deletion of dystroglycan
in mice is sufficient to cause congenital muscular dystrophy-like brain
malformations, including disarray of cerebral cortical layering, fusion
of cerebral hemispheres and cerebellar folia, and aberrant migration of
granule cells. Dystroglycan-null brain loses its high affinity binding
to the extracellular matrix protein laminin (see 150240) and shows
discontinuities in the pial surface basal lamina (glia limitans) that
probably underlie the neuronal migration errors. Furthermore, mutant
mice have severely blunted hippocampal long-term potentiation with
electrophysiologic characterization indicating that dystroglycan might
have a postsynaptic role in learning and memory. Moore et al. (2002)
concluded that these data strongly supported the hypothesis that defects
in dystroglycan are central to the pathogenesis of structural and
functional brain abnormalities seen in congenital muscular dystrophies.

Michele et al. (2002) demonstrated in both muscle-eye-brain disease
(253280) and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (253800) patients
that alpha-dystroglycan is expressed at the muscle membrane, but similar
hypoglycosylation in the diseases directly abolishes binding activity of
dystroglycan for the ligands laminin, neurexin (see 600565), and agrin
(103320). Michele et al. (2002) showed that this posttranslational
biochemical and functional disruption of alpha-dystroglycan is
recapitulated in the muscle and central nervous system of mutant
myodystrophy (myd) mice, who have a mutation in the LARGE gene. Michele
et al. (2002) demonstrated that myd mice have abnormal neuronal
migration in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus, and show
disruption of the basal lamina. In addition, myd mice reveal that
dystroglycan targets proteins to functional sites in brain through its
interactions with extracellular matrix proteins. Michele et al. (2002)
suggested that at least 3 mammalian genes function within a convergent
posttranslational processing pathway during the biosynthesis of
dystroglycan and that abnormal dystroglycan-ligand interactions underlie
the pathogenic mechanism of muscular dystrophy with brain abnormalities.

Cohn et al. (2002) found that striated muscle-specific disruption of the
Dag1 gene in mice resulted in loss of the dystrophin-glycoprotein
complex in differentiated muscle and a remarkably mild muscular
dystrophy with hypertrophy and without tissue fibrosis. They found that
satellite cells, expressing dystroglycan, supported continued efficient
regeneration of skeletal muscle along with transient expression of
dystroglycan in regenerating muscle fibers. Cohn et al. (2002)
demonstrated a similar phenomenon of reexpression of functional
dystroglycan in regenerating muscle fibers in a mild form of human
muscular dystrophy caused by disruption of posttranslational
dystroglycan processing. They concluded that maintenance of regenerative
capacity by satellite cells expressing dystroglycan is likely
responsible for mild disease progression in mice and possibly humans.
Cohn et al. (2002) suggested that inadequate repair of skeletal muscle
by satellite cells represents an important mechanism affecting the
pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy.

Hara et al. (2011) demonstrated that mice with a homozygous T190M
mutation in the Dag1 gene, which corresponds to the human T192M mutation
(128239.0001), developed muscular dystrophy and neurologic motor
impairment. The mutation decreased LARGE (603590)-mediated
posttranslational O-mannosyl glycosylation of Dag1, interfering with its
receptor function and laminin binding in skeletal muscle and brain.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY-DYSTROGLYCANOPATHY (LIMB-GIRDLE), TYPE C, 9 (1
family)
DAG1, THR192MET

In a Turkish woman with limb-girdle muscular
dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (MDDGC9; 613818) and cognitive impairment,
Hara et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 575C-T transition in the DAG1
gene, resulting in a thr192-to-met (T192M) substitution in a highly
conserved residue in the N terminus of the protein. Each unaffected
parent was heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 200
control chromosomes. Functional expression analysis in vitro and in mice
indicated that the mutation decreased LARGE (603590)-mediated
posttranslational O-mannosyl glycosylation of DAG1, interfering with its
receptor function and laminin binding in skeletal muscle and brain.

Wang et al. (2004) identified RILPL1 (614092) and RILPL2, which they
called RLP1 and RLP2, respectively. The deduced 211-amino acid RLP2
protein shares highest identity with RILP in 2 domains that Wang et al.
(2004) called RILP homology domain-1 (RH1) and RH2. Overall, RLP2 shares
32% and 18% amino acid identity with RLP1 and RILP, respectively.
Proteins containing RH domains were detected in several multicellular
organisms, but not in unicellular organisms. PCR analysis of human
tissues detected highest RLP2 expression in lung, followed by placenta.
Lower expression was detected in liver, kidney, pancreas, heart, and
brain, and no expression was detected in skeletal muscle. Epitope-tagged
RLP2 was expressed in the cytoplasm of transfected normal rat kidney
cells.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the RILPL2 gene to chromosome 12q24.31 based on an
alignment of the RILPL2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB085763) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;LEFT-RIGHT DETERMINATION, FACTOR B; LEFTY B;;
LEFTY1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF;;
LEFTB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Vertebrates exhibit numerous left-right (L-R) asymmetries, such as the
position of the heart and spleen on the left side. L-R polarity is
determined early during development, around the presomite stage in
mammals. Several genes have been shown to be expressed asymmetrically
relative to the L-R axis. Meno et al. (1996, 1997) identified 2
transforming growth factor-beta-related genes, Lefty1 and Lefty2
(601887), that are expressed on the left side of developing mouse
embryos. A human sequence corresponding to the mouse Lefty2 gene has
been deposited in the GenBank database (GENBANK AF081507).

Kosaki et al. (1999) characterized 2 homologs of the murine Lefty1 and
Lefty2 genes, which they designated LEFTY B and LEFTY A, respectively.
Both genes encode proteins with 366 amino acids. The deduced amino acid
sequences of LEFTY B and LEFTY A are more similar to each other than to
mouse Lefty1 or Lefty2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kosaki et al. (1999) determined that the LEFTY1 and LEFTY2 genes each
comprise 4 exons spliced at identical positions. The genes are separated
by approximately 50 kb on chromosome 1q42.

MAPPING

Kosaki et al. (1999) mapped the LEFTY1 and LEFTY2 genes to chromosome
1q42 by FISH.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For a discussion of LEFTY2 and the mutations identified in that gene in
cases of left-right axis malformations, see 601877.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lefty1, Lefty2, and Nodal (601265) are expressed on the left side of
developing mouse embryos and are implicated in L-R determination. Meno
et al. (1998) examined the role of Lefty1 by analyzing mutant mice
lacking this gene. The Lefty1-deficient mice showed a variety of L-R
positional defects in visceral organs. The most common feature of Lefty1
-/- mice was thoracic left isomerism (rather than right isomerism). The
lack of Lefty1 resulted in bilateral expression of Nodal, Lefty2, and
Pitx2 (601542), a homeobox gene normally expressed on the left side.
These observations suggested that the role of Lefty1 is to restrict the
expression of Lefty2 and Nodal to the left side, and that Lefty2 or
Nodal encode a signal for 'leftness.'

In mouse embryos, Takaoka et al. (2006) found that Lefty1 was
asymmetrically expressed in the primitive endoderm of the implanting
blastocyst. Lefty1 expression began randomly in the inner cell mass of
the blastocyst but became regionalized to one side of the tilted inner
cell mass shortly after implantation. Asymmetric Lefty1 expression was
established by in vitro culture, indicating that it does not require
interaction with the uterus. Asymmetric Lefty1 expression was induced by
Nodal signaling, although Nodal and genes for its effectors were
expressed symmetrically. Takaoka et al. (2006) concluded that asymmetric
patterning of the mouse embryo along the anteroposterior axis begins in
the periimplantation stage.

Reaction-diffusion models postulated that differences in signaling range
are caused by differential diffusivity of inhibitor and activator. Other
models suggested that differential clearance underlies different
signaling ranges. To test these models, Muller et al. (2012) measured
the biophysical properties of the Nodal/Lefty activator/inhibitor system
during zebrafish embryogenesis. Analysis of Nodal and Lefty gradients
revealed that Nodals have a shorter range than Lefty proteins.
Pulse-labeling analysis indicated that Nodals and Leftys have similar
clearance kinetics, whereas fluorescence recovery assays revealed that
Leftys have a higher effective diffusion coefficient than Nodals. Muller
et al. (2012) concluded that their results indicated that differential
diffusivity is the major determinant of the differences in Nodal/Lefty
range and provided biophysical support for reaction-diffusion models of
activator/inhibitor-mediated patterning.

609591	TITLE *609591 RIC-LIKE PROTEIN WITHOUT CAAX MOTIF 1; RIT1
;;RAS-LIKE PROTEIN EXPRESSED IN MANY TISSUES; RIT;;
ROC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RIT belongs to the RAS (HRAS; 190020) subfamily of small GTPases (Hynds
et al., 2003).

CLONING

By PCR using degenerate primers based on the conserved G3 and G4 domains
of RAS, followed by screening a mouse retina cDNA library, Lee et al.
(1996) cloned mouse Rit. The deduced 219-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 25.6 kD. By EST database analysis, Lee et
al. (1996) identified human RIT. The deduced human protein contains 219
amino acids and shares 94% identity with mouse Rit. Human and mouse RIT
have 5 highly conserved domains characteristic of small G proteins, but
they lack the C-terminal CAAX prenylation motif found in several other
RAS-like proteins. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.2-kb transcript
in all mouse tissues examined. Epitope-tagged mouse Rit localized to the
plasma membrane of transfected cells.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to Drosophila Ric,
Wes et al. (1996) identified human RIT and RIN (609592). The core GTPase
domain of RIT shares 76% identity with that of RIN, and there is only 1
conservative substitution between the 2 human proteins and Drosophila
Ric within the effector G2 region. Northern blot analysis detected RIT
transcripts of 1.35, 2.9, and 3.9 kb in most tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (1996) demonstrated that mouse Rit bound radiolabeled GTP.

Shao et al. (1999) demonstrated that recombinant human RIT and RIN bound
GTP and exhibited intrinsic GTPase activity. Conversion of gln79 to leu
in RIT resulted in complete loss of GTPase activity. The activity of RIT
and RIN was significantly different from that of the majority of
RAS-related GTPases, and the GTP dissociation rates were 5- to 10-fold
faster than most RAS-like GTPases. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis showed that
RIT and RIN interacted with the RAS-binding proteins RALGDS (601619),
RLF (180610), and AF6 (MLLT4; 159559), but not with RAF kinases (e.g.,
RAF1; 164760), RIN1 (605965), or the p110 subunit of PI3K (see 171834).
Shao et al. (1999) concluded that RIT and RIN regulate signaling
pathways and cellular processes distinct from those controlled by RAS.

By expression of RIT in a human neuroblastoma cell line, Hynds et al.
(2003) demonstrated that RIT increased neurite outgrowth and branching
through MEK (see MEK1; 176872)-dependent and MEK-independent signaling
mechanisms, respectively. Adenoviral expression of wildtype or
constitutively active RIT increased neurite initiation, elongation, and
branching on endogenous matrix or a purified laminin-1 substratum. This
outgrowth was morphologically distinct from that promoted by
constitutively active RAS or RAF. Constitutively active RIT increased
phosphorylation of ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948), but not
AKT (see AKT1; 164730). A MEK inhibitor blocked RIT-induced neurite
initiation, but not elongation or branching.

Shi and Andres (2005) found that stimulation of a rat pheochromocytoma
cell line by growth factors, including nerve growth factor (NGF;
162030), resulted in rapid and prolonged Rit activation. Ectopic
expression of active human RIT promoted neurite outgrowth and stimulated
activation of both Erk and p38 MAP kinase (MAPK14; 600289) signaling
pathways. RIT-induced differentiation depended upon both MAP kinase
cascades, since MEK inhibition blocked RIT-induced neurite outgrowth,
and p38 blockade inhibited neurite elongation and branching, but not
neurite initiation. Moreover, the ability of NGF to promote neuronal
differentiation was attenuated by Rit knockdown.

Heo et al. (2006) surveyed plasma membrane targeting mechanisms by
imaging the subcellular localization of 125 fluorescent
protein-conjugated Ras, Rab, Arf, and Rho proteins. Of 48 proteins that
were localized to the plasma membrane, 37 contained clusters of
positively charged amino acids. To test whether these polybasic clusters
bind negatively charged phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate lipids,
Heo et al. (2006) developed a chemical phosphatase activation method to
deplete plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.
Unexpectedly, proteins with polybasic clusters dissociated from the
plasma membrane only when both phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate were depleted, arguing that
both lipid second messengers jointly regulate plasma membrane targeting.

MAPPING

Wes et al. (1996) stated that the RIT gene was mapped to chromosome 1 by
somatic cell hybrid analysis. The mouse Rit gene maps to chromosome 3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 17 unrelated patients with Noonan syndrome-8 (NS8; 615355), Aoki et
al. (2013) identified heterozygous mutations in the RIT1 gene (see,
e.g., 609591.0001-609591.0004). The first mutations were found by exome
sequencing and subsequent mutations were identified from a larger cohort
of patients screened for the RIT1 gene. A total of 9 missense mutations
were found in 17 (9%) of 180 individuals suspected to have the disorder.
The phenotype was characterized by short stature, distinctive facial
features, and a high incidence of congenital heart defects and
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A subset of patients showed intellectual
disabilities. All of the mutations occurred de novo, except in 1 patient
who inherited the mutation from a mother with a Noonan syndrome
phenotype. The mutations tended to cluster in the switch II region, and
in vitro functional expression studies of 3 of the mutations showed that
they resulted in a gain of function. Transfection of 2 of the mutations
into zebrafish embryos resulted in a variety of developmental defects,
including gastrulation defects, craniofacial abnormalities, pericardial
edema, and elongated yolk sac. A smaller percentage of mutant embryos
showed even more disorganized growth and abnormal cardiogenesis. The
findings were similar to those observed with mutations in other RAS
genes (see, e.g., PTPN11, 176876; SOS1, 182530; NRAS, 164790) causing
other forms of Noonan syndrome.

In 4 unrelated patients with Noonan syndrome-8 (NS8; 615355), Aoki et
al. (2013) identified a de novo heterozygous c.170C-G transversion in
exon 4 of the RIT1 gene, resulting in an ala57-to-gly (A57G)
substitution at a conserved residue. In vitro cellular expression
studies showed that the A57G mutation resulted in a gain of function.

In a patient with Noonan syndrome-8 (615355), Aoki et al. (2013)
identified a de novo heterozygous c.242A-G transition in exon 5 of the
RIT1 gene, resulting in a glu81-to-gly (E81G) substitution at a
conserved residue. In vitro cellular expression studies showed that the
E81G mutation resulted in a gain of function. Transfection of the E81G
mutation into zebrafish embryos resulted in a variety of developmental
defects, including gastrulation defects, craniofacial abnormalities,
pericardial edema, and elongated yolk sac. A smaller percentage of

In 2 unrelated patients with Noonan syndrome-8 (615355), Aoki et al.
(2013) identified a de novo heterozygous c.246T-G transversion in exon 5
of the RIT1 gene, resulting in a phe82-to-leu (F82L) substitution at a
conserved residue. The mutation, which was initially found by exome
sequencing, was not present in several control databases. In vitro
cellular expression studies showed that the F82L mutation resulted in a
gain of function.

.0004
NOONAN SYNDROME 8
RIT1, GLY95ALA

In 4 unrelated patients with Noonan syndrome-8 (615355), Aoki et al.
(2013) identified a de novo heterozygous c.284G-C transversion in exon 5
of the RIT1 gene, resulting in a gly95-to-ala (G95A) substitution. The
mutation, which was initially found by exome sequencing, was not present
in several control databases. In vitro cellular expression studies
showed that the G95A mutation resulted in a gain of function.
Transfection of the G95A mutation into zebrafish embryos resulted in a
variety of developmental defects, including gastrulation defects,
craniofacial abnormalities, pericardial edema, and elongated yolk sac. A
smaller percentage of mutant embryos showed even more disorganized
growth and abnormal cardiogenesis.

611141	TITLE *611141 MINDBOMB, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 2; MIB2
;;SKELETROPHIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display to identify genes upregulated by truncated
SWI1 (ARID1A; 603024) in a neuroblastoma cell line, followed by
screening a brain cDNA library, Takeuchi et al. (2003) cloned MIB2,
which they called skeletrophin. The deduced 1,013-amino acid protein
contains a dystrophin (DMD; 300377)-like cysteine-rich zinc-binding
domain in its N-terminal half and 5 ankyrin (see 600465) repeats in its
C-terminal half. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.2-kb transcript
that was highly expressed in skeletal muscle and more weakly expressed
in brain, heart, and kidney. Western blot analysis detected a 70-kD
protein in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain, but not in liver, thymus,
or lung. Immunohistochemical analysis of skeletal muscle detected
cytoplasmic foci of skeletrophin expression near the cell surface.

Takeuchi et al. (2005) stated that skeletrophin contains 2 C-terminal
RING-HC domains, the second of which is atypical. By database analysis,
they identified 6 skeletrophin splice variants. RT-PCR analysis showed
tissue-specific expression of 3 of the variants. Dot blot analysis using
a cDNA encoding the N-terminal half of skeletrophin as probe revealed
widespread expression, with highest levels in skeletal muscle.

Koo et al. (2005) identified mouse and human MIB2 as paralogs of
zebrafish Mib (MIB1; 608677). MIB2 has a HERC2 (605837)/Mib domain on
each side of the zinc finger domain, as well as a Mib repeat prior to
the ankyrin repeats. Mouse tissues expressed 2 major Mib2 variants, and
overall expression was higher in neonates and adults than in embryos.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, Takeuchi et al.
(2003) showed that skeletrophin interacted with alpha-actin (ACTA1;
102610). Skeletrophin was expressed in 23 of 25 benign nevi, but not in
18 of 38 cases of primary skin melanoma. Treatment with a demethylating
agent restored skeletrophin expression in a human melanoma cell line.

Takeuchi et al. (2005) showed that a recombinant protein containing only
the RING domains of skeletrophin promoted autoubiquitination in a UBCH5B
(UBE2D2; 602962)-dependent manner. Mutation of cys969 in the second RING
motif eliminated the activity, whereas mutation of cys891 in the first
RING motif had no effect. Protein pull-down assays showed that
full-length skeletrophin bound Jagged-2 (JAG2; 602570), but it did not
bind other Notch (see NOTCH1; 190198) ligands tested. Skeletrophin
ubiquitinated the intracellular domain of JAG2, and immunohistochemical
analysis indicated that skeletrophin expression altered the
intracellular localization of JAG2. Overexpression of skeletrophin in a
mouse myeloma cell line induced expression of the Notch effector Hes1
(139605) in cocultured mouse stromal cells by direct cell-cell contact.
RING finger-mutated skeletrophin did not enhance Hes1 expression.
Takeuchi et al. (2005) found elevated skeletrophin expression in 23 of
40 multiple myeloma specimens, especially from patients with osteolytic
bone lesions.

Koo et al. (2005) showed that the RING domains of mouse Mib2 had E3
ubiquitin ligase activity. Mutation of the second RING domain, but not
the first, reduced the activity. Full-length Mib2 underwent
autoubiquitination in transfected cells, an effect that was dramatically
increased in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor. Mib2 interacted
with Xenopus Delta (XD; see 606582) in transfected cells, and mutation
analysis showed that the intracellular domain of XD interacted with the
N-terminal region of Mib2. In transfected HeLa cells, mouse Mib2
colocalized with an early endosomal marker, and coexpression of Mib2
with XD caused ubiquitination of XD and relocalization of XD from the
cell surface into cytoplasmic vesicular structures. Mib2 rescued both
the neuronal and vascular defects in the zebrafish Mib mutant,
confirming that Mib2 acts along the Notch signaling pathway.

Takeuchi et al. (2006) found aberrant methylation of the skeletrophin
promoter in 6 of 31 invasive melanomas, but in none of 25 benign nevi or
5 noninvasive superficial spreading melanomas. The zinc finger
transcription factor SNAIL (see SNAI1; 604238), which is overexpressed
in many melanoma cells, repressed the skeletrophin promoter via an E
box-related element and was involved in downregulation of skeletrophin.
AP2 (TFAP2A; 107580) increased skeletrophin expression. Exogenous
expression of skeletrophin reduced melanoma cell invasion in vitro and
in vivo, and colony formation in soft agar was reduced in a RING
motif-dependent manner, without affecting cell growth. Skeletrophin
downregulated transcription of MET (164860) and increased expression of
HES1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Takeuchi et al. (2005) determined that the MIB2 gene contains 18 exons
and spans 14 kb.

Takeuchi et al. (2006) found that the MIB2 promoter region is GC rich
and lacks typical TATA and CAAT boxes.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Takeuchi et al. (2003) mapped the MIB2 gene to chromosome
1p36.3-p36.2. Takeuchi et al. (2005) mapped the MIB2 gene to chromosome
1p36.32 by genomic sequence analysis.

606695	TITLE *606695 OPSIN 3; OPN3
;;PANOPSIN;;
ENCEPHALOPSIN; ECPN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Opsins, including OPN3, are members of the superfamily of guanine
nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors, which function
through the activation of a G protein and an effector enzyme. Opsin
proteins consist of a single polypeptide chain of 340 to 500 amino acids
that form 7 alpha-helical transmembrane regions connected by cytoplasmic
and extracellular loops.

CLONING

By screening an EST database with a putative Xenopus extraretinal opsin,
followed by RACE, Blackshaw and Snyder (1999) obtained full-length cDNAs
encoding mouse and human OPN3, which they called encephalopsin. The
predicted 403-amino acid human OPN3 protein shares 85.5% identity with
the mouse protein. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues revealed
strong expression of Opn3 in cortex, cerebellum, and testes only, with
faint expression in heart, liver, and kidney. In situ hybridization
localized Opn3 to pachytene spermatids in testes. Blackshaw and Snyder
(1999) also detected high expression of Opn3 in the preoptic area and
paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Opn3 showed developmentally
regulated, highly patterned expression in other regions of the brain,
being enriched in selected regions of the cerebral cortex, cerebellar
Purkinje cells, a subset of striatal neurons, selected thalamic nuclei,
and a subset of interneurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The
authors observed rostrocaudal gradients of Opn3 expression present in
cortex, cerebellum, and striatum, as well as radial stripes of Opn3
expression in cerebellum. Blackshaw and Snyder (1999) concluded that
Opn3 may play a role in encephalic photoreception.

By searching an EST database for sequences related to mammalian
nonvisual opsins, followed by further database searches and RACE,
Halford et al. (2001) assembled a cDNA sequence encoding OPN3, which
they called panopsin. The predicted protein differed slightly from the
sequence predicted by Blackshaw and Snyder (1999). OPN3 contains
features characteristic of functional opsins, including a C-terminal
region enriched in serine and threonine residues, an N-linked
glycosylation site, a C-linked palmitoylation site, 2 conserved cysteine
residues, and a conserved ERY tripeptide. Northern blot analysis of
human tissues detected 2 major OPN3 transcripts of 2.1 and 2.5 kb
resulting from the use of 2 alternate polyadenylation signals. OPN3
expression was observed in all tissues examined, including brain, liver,
placenta, heart, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas. PCR
analysis detected OPN3 in retina cDNA. Halford et al. (2001) noted that
they detected a wider tissue distribution of OPN3 expression compared
with Blackshaw and Snyder (1999), who did not detect mouse Opn3 in
retina.

GENE STRUCTURE

By comparing genomic and cDNA sequences, Halford et al. (2001)
determined that the OPN3 gene contains 4 exons spanning approximately 47
kb.

MAPPING

Using a somatic cell hybrid panel and FISH, Halford et al. (2001) mapped
the OPN3 gene to chromosome 1q43. They concluded that the OPN3 gene
overlaps with the KMO gene (603538) and that the 2 genes are transcribed
from opposite strands. Halford et al. (2001) also noted that the CHML
gene (118825) lies within intron 1 of the OPN3 gene.

179020	TITLE *179020 PYRIDOXAL KINASE; PDXK
;;PYRIDOXINE KINASE; PNK;;
PKH;;
VITAMIN B6 KINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pyridoxal kinase (PDXK; EC 2.7.1.35) converts vitamin B6 to
pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP), an essential cofactor in the intermediate
metabolism of amino acids and neurotransmitters.

CLONING

Hanna et al. (1997) cloned the cDNA encoding PDXK, which they referred
to as PKH. The PDXK gene encodes a 312-amino acid polypeptide, and
expression of the cDNA revealed pyridoxal kinase activity. Northern blot
analysis revealed that a major 1.5-kb PDXK transcript was expressed in
all tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

The expression of PDXK shows circadian oscillations. Gachon et al.
(2004) found that the expression of Pdxk in mouse liver and brain is
regulated by the 3 PAR bZIP transcription factors, Dbp (124097), Hlf
(142385), and Tef (179020), which also show circadian oscillations in
expression. Mice devoid of all 3 transcription factors showed decreased
levels of brain PLP, serotonin, and dopamine, and were highly
susceptible to generalized spontaneous and audiogenic epilepsies that
were frequently lethal.

MAPPING

Hanna et al. (1997) reported that a BAC clone from the human 21q22.3
region contains almost the entire PDXK gene on 10 distinct exons.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Chern and Beutler (1976) concluded that alleles at a locus symbolized
PNK determine the level of activity of pyridoxine kinase in
erythrocytes: PNK(H) and PNK(L), for 'high' and 'low', respectively. The
frequency of these 2 alleles was estimated to be 0.81 and 0.19 for
whites and 0.35 and 0.65 for blacks. They suggested that the PNK(L)
state of red cells is the result of a stability mutation.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

138130	TITLE *138130 GLUTAMATE DEHYDROGENASE 1; GLUD1
;;GLUD;;
GDH
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

L-glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.3) has a central role in nitrogen
metabolism in plants and animals. Glutamate dehydrogenase is found in
all organisms and catalyzes the oxidative deamination of 1-glutamate to
2-oxoglutarate (Smith et al., 2001). Glutamate, the main substrate of
GLUD, is present in brain in concentrations higher than in other organs.
In nervous tissue, GLUD appears to function in both the synthesis and
the catabolism of glutamate and perhaps in ammonia detoxification
(Mavrothalassitis et al., 1988).

CLONING

Hanauer et al. (1985) detected a cDNA clone expressed in skeletal muscle
that they concluded is homologous with GLUD because of close
similarities of its deduced amino acid sequence to that of the bovine
protein. Mavrothalassitis et al. (1988) reported the characterization of
4 human liver cDNA clones encoding the entire sequence of GLUD.
Blot-hybridization analysis of genomic DNA suggested that the human
enzyme is encoded by a small multigene family. Multiple GLUD-related
transcripts were identified in human, monkey, and rabbit tissues.
Nakatani et al. (1988) reported the complete sequence of GLUD cDNA.

Son et al. (2013) reported that whereas most cells use GLUD1 to convert
glutamine-derived glutamate into alpha-ketoglutarate in the mitochondria
to fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(see 260350) cells rely on a distinct pathway in which glutamine-derived
aspartate is transported into the cytoplasm, where it can be converted
into oxaloacetate by aspartate transaminase (GOT1; 138180). Son et al.
(2013) found that knockdown of KRAS (190070) in PDAC cells resulted in a
marked increase in GLUD1 and a decrease in GOT1 expression at both the
transcriptional and the protein levels. Additionally, they showed that
expression on GOT1 increased and GLUD1 decreased in an oncogenic
KRAS-dependent manner in vivo. Son et al. (2013) concluded that their
findings demonstrated that the reprogramming of glutamine metabolism is
mediated by oncogenic KRAS, the signature genetic alteration in PDAC,
through the transcriptional upregulation and repression of key metabolic
enzymes in this pathway.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Hanauer et al. (1985) mapped the GLUD1 gene to
10q23-q24.

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization,
Anagnou et al. (1989) confirmed the assignment of GLUD1 to chromosome
10, but concluded that the precise localization is 10q21.1-q21.2. By in
situ hybridization, Jung et al. (1989) mapped the gene to 10q23, and
Deloukas et al. (1993) refined the localization to 10q23.3.

Using a RFLP in the study of recombinant inbred strains, Shaughnessy et
al. (1989) found that the murine Glud locus cosegregates with Rib1
(180440) and Tcra (see 186880), which are known to be on mouse
chromosome 14. By genomic Southern analysis of a panel of Chinese
hamster/mouse somatic cell hybrids, Tzimagiorgis et al. (1991) concluded
that there are 2 independent mouse GLUD loci, termed Glud and Glud2,
which map to chromosome 14 and 7, respectively. By homology, the Glud
locus on chromosome 14 is likely to be the functional one. On the other
hand, their evidence appeared to indicate that the Glud2 gene on mouse
chromosome 7 is not a processed pseudogene. Both chromosome 7 and 14 of
the mouse have regions of linkage homology to human 10q.

- Pseudogenes

Several GLUD pseudogenes have been identified. Hanauer et al. (1985) and
Anagnou et al. (1989) confirmed the presence of a pseudogene, GLUDP1, on
Xq26-28. Jung et al. (1989) mapped the GLUDP1 pseudogene to Xq24.
Michaelidis et al. (1993) identified 4 presumed truncated pseudogenes,
at least 2 of which may have been generated by retrotransposition.
Deloukas et al. (1993) concluded that there are 2 GLUD pseudogenes on
10q which are not linked to the functional gene: GLUDP2 at 10q11.2 and
GLUDP3 at 10q22.1. Tzimagiorgis et al. (1993) mapped another locus,
termed GLUDP5, to 10p11.2. They pointed out that the work of their group
(Michaelidis et al., 1993) raised the number of human GLUD loci to 6.

GENE STRUCTURE

Michaelidis et al. (1993) determined that the GLUD1 gene is about 45 kb
long and contains 13 exons.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Hanauer et al. (1985) suggested that the GLUD clones they detected may
be useful in study of the postulated relationship of partial glutamate
dehydrogenase deficiency and a form of olivopontocerebellar atrophy
(OPCA). Plaitakis et al. (1980, 1982, 1984) and Duvoisin et al. (1983)
found partial deficiency of GLUD in fibroblasts and leukocytes of some
patients with OPCA. Yamaguchi et al. (1982) and Sorbi et al. (1986)
found a similar deficiency in platelets of OPCA patients. Barbeau et al.
(1980) could find no abnormality of GLUD in 8 patients with a dominant
form of OPCA.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 infants with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia
(606762), Stanley et al. (1997) identified heterozygosity for activating
mutations in the GLUD1 gene (138130.0001 and 138130.0002).

In a study of 4 sporadic and 2 familial cases, Stanley et al. (1998)
identified 5 missense mutations that alter 1 of 4 amino acids between
residues 446 and 454 in exons 11 and 12 of the GLUD1 gene (see, e.g.,
138130.0003-138130.0005), a region that encodes the allosteric domain.
All of these mutations were associated with a diminished inhibitory
effect of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) on glutamate dehydrogenase
activity.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 6
GLUD1, HIS454TYR

In an infant with the syndrome of hypoglycemia due to congenital
hyperinsulinism combined with persistent unexplained hyperammonemia
(606762), Stanley et al. (1997) identified heterozygosity for a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 1519 in the GLUD1 gene, predicted to cause a
his454-to-tyr (H454Y) substitution in the mature protein. The patient
was a sporadic case. Also see 138130.0002.

.0002
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 6
GLUD1, SER445LEU

In an infant with the syndrome of hypoglycemia due to congenital
hyperinsulinism combined with persistent unexplained hyperammonemia
(606762), Stanley et al. (1997) identified heterozygosity for a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 1493 in the GLUD1 gene, predicted to cause a
ser445-to-leu (S448L) substitution in the mature GDH peptide. Both of
the mutations reported by Stanley et al. (1997) (see 138130.0001)
affected only 1 of the 2 GDH alleles and were not present in the
parents, indicating that the disorder is autosomal dominant.

In 3 unrelated Japanese infants with congenital
hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia, Miki et al. (2000) identified
heterozygosity for the S445L mutation in the allosteric domain of the
GLUD1 gene.

.0003
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 6
GLUD1, SER448PRO

In affected members of 2 separate families with hyperinsulinemic
hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia (606762), one from Canada and the other
from Italy, Stanley et al. (1998) identified heterozygosity for a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 1514, resulting in a ser448-to-pro (S448P)
substitution. In each family, a mother and child were affected. This
mutation results in less severe hypoglycemia than that seen in patients
with a sporadic mutation. Basal enzyme activity was 38% of normal.

In family 2 studied by Thornton et al. (1998), Glaser et al. (1998)
identified the S448P mutation in the GLUD1 gene.

.0004
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 6
GLUD1, GLY446SER

In 2 unrelated individuals with hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome
(606762), Stanley et al. (1998) identified heterozygosity for a G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 1508 of the GLUD1 gene, resulting in a
gly446-to-ser (G446S) substitution at codon 446. This dominant mutation
causes severe hypoglycemia and a 2- to 5-fold increase in plasma
ammonium concentration due to decreased sensitivity to GTP-induced
inhibition, which was demonstrated in the patients' lymphoblasts.

.0005
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 6
GLUD1, GLY446ASP

In 2 unrelated individuals with the hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia
syndrome (606762), Stanley et al. (1998) identified heterozygosity for a
G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1509 of the GLUD1 gene, resulting in a
gly446-to-asp (G446D) substitution. This dominant mutation results in
severe hypoglycemia and a 2- to 5-fold increase in plasma ammonium
concentration due to decreased sensitivity to GTP-induced inhibition,
which was demonstrated in the patients' lymphoblasts.

.0006
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 6
GLUD1, GLU296ALA

In a 6-month-old Japanese girl with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and
hyperammonemia (606762), Miki et al. (2000) identified heterozygosity
for a 1059A-C transversion in exon 7 of the GLUD1 gene, resulting in a
glu296-to-ala (E296A) substitution within the catalytic domain.

.0007
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 6
GLUD1, ARG265LYS

In a 6-day-old Japanese boy with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and
hyperammonemia (606762), Miki et al. (2000) identified heterozygosity
for a 966G-A transition in exon 7 of the GLUD1 gene, resulting in an
arg265-to-lys (R265K) substitution within the catalytic domain.

.0008
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 6
GLUD1, ARG221CYS

In 5 affected members of a 3-generation family with hyperinsulinemic
hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia (606762), Santer et al. (2001)
identified heterozygosity for an 833C-T transition in exon 6 of the
GLUD1 gene, resulting in an arg221-to-cys (R221C) substitution within
the catalytic domain.

.0009
HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA, FAMILIAL, 6
GLUD1, ARG269HIS

In 9 affected members of 6 unrelated families with hyperinsulinemic
hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia (606762), Santer et al. (2001)
identified heterozygosity for a 978G-A transition in exon 7 of the GLUD1
gene, resulting in an arg269-to-his (R269H) substitution within the
catalytic domain.

603929	TITLE *603929 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 4-GAMMA, 3; EIF4G3
;;EIF4GII
DESCRIPTION Mammalian eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) is a
scaffolding polypeptide that appears to be responsible for recruiting
the 43S preinitiation complex to the mRNA through interactions with
eIF4E (133440), eIF4A (see 602641) , eIF3 (see 602039), and 40S
ribosomes. See eIF4GI (600495). Gradi et al. (1998) identified a partial
human cDNA encoding a protein with homology to human and rabbit eIF4GI.
By screening additional libraries, the authors isolated cDNAs
corresponding to the complete coding region of the novel protein, which
they designated eIF4GII. The predicted 1,585-amino acid eIF4GII protein
is 46% identical to eIF4GI. On Western blots, both eIF4G proteins
migrated at approximately 220 kD. Using an in vitro assay, Gradi et al.
(1998) showed that eIF4GII, like eIF4GI, was cleaved by the picornavirus
rhinovirus 2A(pro). Far Western analysis and coimmunoprecipitation
experiments demonstrated that eIF4GII directly interacts with eIF4E,
eIF4A, and eIF3. eIF4GII restored cap-dependent translation in a
reticulocyte lysate that had been pretreated with rhinovirus 2A(pro) to
cleave endogenous eIF4G, leading the authors to conclude that eIF4GII is
a functional homolog of eIF4GI. Northern blot analysis revealed that
eIF4GII is expressed ubiquitously as 5.2-kb and 6.0-kb mRNAs. Imataka et
al. (1998) demonstrated that the N-terminal regions of both eIF4GI and
eIF4GII bind to PABP (604679).

611132	TITLE *611132 RIBOKINASE; RBKS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

All metabolic sugars are phosphorylated to trap them inside the cell and
to prepare them for further chemical reactions. Ribokinase (EC 2.7.1.15)
phosphorylates ribose, an essential sugar in nucleotide biosynthesis
(Bork et al., 1993).

GENE FUNCTION

Although D-ribose is not generally effective as a sole carbon source for
cultured animal cells, ribose-utilizing strains have been isolated.
Ribose-utilizing variants of the rat Novikoff hepatoma cell line show
changes in ribokinase activity. Jargiello (1982) found that parental and
some variant Novikoff cells had 3 peaks of ribokinase activity, during
S, G2, and M phase. In contrast, variants with high basal levels of
ribokinase had only 1 peak of enzyme activity, during S phase.
Ribokinase activity was either soluble or membrane-associated, and the
subcellular localization differed between cell strains.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the RBKS gene to chromosome 2p23.2 based on an
alignment of the RBKS sequence (GenBank GENBANK AJ404857) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

606533	TITLE *606533 CHLORIDE INTRACELLULAR CHANNEL 3; CLIC3
DESCRIPTION Most chloride channels are localized to the plasma membrane. Members of
the chloride intracellular channel (CLIC) family are expressed in the
nucleus as well as the plasma membrane, but they lack the
membrane-spanning domains characteristic of channel proteins.

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a fetal brain cDNA library with the C
terminus of rat Erk7 as bait, followed by EST database searching, Qian
et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding CLIC3. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 208-amino acid protein is approximately 49% and 61%
identical to CLIC1 (602872) and CLIC2 (300138), respectively. CLIC3
contains a conserved transmembrane domain, N-terminal and central
phosphorylation sites, and an N-terminal N-myristoylation site.
Immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the interaction of Erk7 and CLIC3
in transfected cells. Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of
a 1.15-kb transcript, with highest levels in placenta and abundant
levels in heart and lung. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated
nuclear colocalization of Erk7 and CLIC3, with some cytoplasmic
expression of CLIC3. Further functional analysis suggested that CLIC3
mediates chloride transport across the plasma membrane. Based on
sequence homology, Qian et al. (1999) proposed that CLIC3, like CLIC1,
is a nuclear chloride transporter.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CLIC3
gene to chromosome 9 (TMAP stSG28803).

111730	TITLE *111730 BETA-1,4-N-ACETYL-GALACTOSAMINYLTRANSFERASE 2; B4GALNT2
;;GALGT2;;
CT-GalNAc TRANSFERASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

B4GALNT2 catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of the human Sd(a)
antigen, which is found on more than 90% of Caucasian red blood cells,
through the addition of an N-acetylgalactosamine residue via a beta-1,4
linkage to a subterminal galactose residue substituted with an
alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid. B4GALNT2 also catalyzes the last step in
the biosynthesis of the Cad antigen, which is related both serologically
and biochemically to the Sd(a) antigen (summary by Montiel et al.,
2003).

CLONING

CT1 and CT2 are monoclonal antibodies that recognize an oligosaccharide
structure that is identical, at least in part, to Sd(a). Using
expression cloning to identify a mouse cDNA that synthesized an epitope
recognized by CT2, Smith and Lowe (1994) cloned B4galnt2, which they
designated CT-GalNAc transferase. The deduced 510-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 58.3 kD. It has characteristics of a type
II transmembrane glycosyltransferase, with a short N-terminal tail,
followed by a transmembrane domain and a 478-amino acid C-terminal
catalytic domain predicted to face the Golgi lumen. The mouse CT-GalNAc
transferase cDNA shares 51% nucleotide identity with the human cDNA
encoding GM2/GD2 synthase (B4GALNT1; 601873), with highest identity in
the region encoding the catalytic domain.

Dohi et al. (1996) obtained a partial human B4GALNT2 sequence by RT-PCR
of gastric mucosa RNA using primers based on mouse CT-GalNAcT. The human
cDNA fragment shared 86% nucleotide identity with mouse CT-GalNAc
transferase and 63% identity with human GM2/GD2 GalNAc transferase.
Northern blot analysis detected a 2-kb B4GALNT2 transcript in normal
gastric mucosa. RT-PCR detected expression in normal human stomach,
jejunum, and ileum, with a proximal-to-distal gradient of expression in
colon.

By searching databases for sequence similar to mouse B4galnt2, followed
by RT-PCR and 5-prime RACE of a human colon carcinoma cell line, Montiel
et al. (2003) cloned 2 variants of B4GALNT2. The longer transcript
encodes a deduced 566-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular
mass of 63.3 kD. It contains an N-terminal cytosolic domain, followed by
a transmembrane domain and a long catalytic domain. The shorter
transcript encodes a deduced 506-amino acid protein with calculated
molecular mass of 57.0 kD. It has a different N-terminal cytosolic
domain than the full-length form. Northern blot analysis detected
B4GALNT2 transcripts of 8.8, 6.1, 4.7, 3.8, and 1.65 kb. Highest
expression was in colon, with lower expression in kidney, stomach,
ileum, and rectum. RNA dot blot analysis showed basal and low expression
of B4GALNT2 in all normal tissues examined, and RT-PCR detected
expression in several cancer cell lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Montiel et al. (2003) determined that the B4GALNT2 gene contains at
least 12 exons, including 2 alternatively spliced first exons, and spans
more than 36 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Montiel et al. (2003) mapped the B4GALNT2
gene to chromosome 17q23.1. The mouse gene maps to chromosome 11 in a
region that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 17 (Mohlke et
al., 1999).

GENE FUNCTION

By biochemical analysis, Smith and Lowe (1994) confirmed that mouse
CT-GalNAc transferase synthesized the epitope recognized by human
anti-Sd(a) serum.

Using RT-PCR, Dohi et al. (1996) found that 6 of 9 cases of gastric
cancer and 9 of 13 cases of colonic cancer lacked B4GALNT2 transcript.
These results correlated with a lack of B4GALNT2 activity measured in
the same samples. Dohi et al. (1996) concluded that reduced B4GALNT2
transcription results in disappearance of the Sd(a) epitope in
gastrointestinal cancer.

Montiel et al. (2003) found that a soluble B4GALNT2 protein N-terminally
truncated at gly89 could transfer N-acetylgalactosamine to several
natural and synthetic acceptor substrates, but it required a galactose
residue to be beta-1,3-linked to an N-acetylglucosamine or
N-acetylgalactosamine residue or beta-1,4-linked to glucose or an
N-acetylglucosamine residue.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

ANIMAL MODEL

Type I von Willebrand disease (VWD1; 193400), characterized by reduced
levels of plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF; 613160), is the most common
inherited bleeding disorder in humans. Mohlke et al. (1996) noted that
penetrance of VWD is incomplete, and expression of the bleeding
phenotype is highly variable. In addition, plasma VWF levels vary widely
among normal individuals. It is likely that the wide range of severity,
variable expressivity, and incomplete penetrance of von Willebrand
disease eventually may be explained through a complex series of
interactions between the VWF gene and a variety of modifier genes,
including proteins involved in posttranslational processing and other
aspects of VWF biosynthesis and clearance. To identify genes that
influence VWF level, Mohlke et al. (1996) analyzed a genetic cross
between 2 strains of mice that exhibit a 20-fold difference in plasma
Vwf levels (Sweeney et al., 1990). DNA samples from F2 progeny
demonstrating either extremely high or extremely low plasma Vwf levels
were pooled and phenotyped for 41 markers spanning the autosomal genome.
A novel locus accounting for 63% of the total variance in Vwf levels was
mapped to distal mouse chromosome 11, a site distinct from the murine
Vwf locus on chromosome 6. Mohlke et al. (1996) designated the locus
Mvwf for 'modifier of Vwf.' Additional genotyping of as many as 2,407
meioses established a high resolution genetic map placing the gene
between Ngfr (162010) and Hoxb9 (142964), and it was closely linked to
Gip (137240). The Mvwf candidate interval between Ngfr and Hoxb9 was
approximately 0.5 cM. The results of Mohlke et al. (1996) demonstrated
that a single dominant gene accounted for the low Vwf phenotype of 1
strain of mice and crosses with several other strains. The pattern of
inheritance suggested a gain-of-function mutation in a unique component
of Vwf biosynthesis or processing. They commented that characterization
of the human homolog for Mvwf may have relevance for a subset of type 1
VWD cases and may define an important genetic factor modifying
penetrance and expression of mutations at the VWF locus.

GALGT2 is expressed primarily in the gut epithelium in both mice and
humans. Mohlke et al. (1999) found that Mvwf, the gene responsible for
modifying plasma levels of Vwf in a strain of mice, was Galgt2. They
showed that the mutation causing deficiency of Vwf changed expression of
the gene from gut specific to the vascular endothelium. Ginsburg (1999)
expressed the opinion that the same alteration is highly unlikely in
humans. However, the Mvwf modifier gene effect may be a useful paradigm
for understanding genetic modification of plasma VWF levels.

606887	TITLE *606887 SULFITE OXIDASE; SUOX
DESCRIPTION Sulfite oxidase (EC 1.8.3.1) is the terminal enzyme in the oxidative
degradation pathway of sulfur-containing amino acids.

CLONING

Garrett et al. (1995) isolated a 2.4-kb cDNA clone of human sulfite
oxidase from a human liver cDNA library. The deduced 488-amino acid
protein has a molecular mass of approximately 52 kD and shows 88%
homology to the rat protein and 67% homology to the chicken protein.
Comparison of 3 sulfite oxidase sequences to several plant and fungal
nitrate reductase sequences revealed a single conserved cysteine with
highly conserved flanking sequences. Garrett et al. (1995) postulated
that the conserved cysteine is a ligand of molybdenum in sulfite oxidase
and nitrate reductase.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Kisker et al. (1997) determined the crystal structure of chicken liver
sulfite oxidase, which is homologous to the human protein, at
1.9-angstrom resolution. They found that each monomer of the dimeric
enzyme consists of 3 domains. At the active site, the Mo is
penta-coordinated by 3 sulfur ligands, 1 oxo group, and 1 water/hydroxo.
A sulfate molecule adjacent to the Mo identifies the substrate binding
pocket.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the sulfite
oxidase gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP sts-AA026389).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kisker et al. (1997) characterized 4 missense mutations in the SUOX gene
(606887.0001-606887.0004) in cell lines from patients with isolated
sulfite oxidase deficiency (272300). The crystallographic results
predicted that 2 of these mutations (arg160 to gln, 606887.0001 and
ala208 to asp, 606887.0002) are near the sulfate-binding site, whereas
the other mutations (ser370 to tyr, 606887.0003 and gly473 to asp,
606887.0004) occur within the domain mediating dimerization.

Johnson et al. (2002) identified 12 novel mutations in the SUOX gene in
patients with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency. These included 2
frameshift mutations, 2 homozygous nonsense mutations, and 8 missense
mutations.

Seidahmed et al. (2005) identified a 1-bp deletion in the SUOX gene
(606887.0005) in a male infant with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SULFITE OXIDASE DEFICIENCY, ISOLATED
SUOX, ARG160GLN

In a cell line from a patient with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency
(272300), Kisker et al. (1997) found a G-to-A substitution at nucleotide
479 of the cDNA of liver sulfite oxidase, resulting in an arg-to-gln
substitution at amino acid residue 160 (R160Q).

The R160Q mutation was identified by Garrett et al. (1998) in a
5-year-old girl with sulfite oxidase deficiency born of first-cousin
parents of Dutch descent. Recombinant protein containing the R160Q
mutation, expressed in Escherichia coli, contained its full complement
of molybdenum and heme, but exhibited 2% of native activity under
standard assay conditions. Absorption spectroscopy of the isolated
molybdenum domains of native sulfite oxidase and of the R160Q mutant
showed significant differences in the 480- and 350-nm absorption bands,
suggestive of altered geometry at the molybdenum center. Other studies
led to the proposal that under normal circumstances arg160 attracts the
anionic substrate sulfite to the binding site near the molybdenum.

SULFITE OXIDASE DEFICIENCY, ISOLATED
SUOX, 1-BP DEL, 1244G

In a male infant with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency (272300) from
a consanguineous Arab family, Seidahmed et al. (2005) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (1244delG) in the SUOX gene, predicting
a frameshift at amino acid 117 and resulting in a mutant protein of only
128 amino acids with total truncation of the molybdopterin and
dimerizing domains. The parents and 1 unaffected sib were heterozygous
for the deletion.
