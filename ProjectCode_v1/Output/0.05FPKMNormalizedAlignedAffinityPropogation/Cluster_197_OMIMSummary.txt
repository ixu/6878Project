613598	TITLE *613598 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 513; ZNF513
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Naz et al. (2010) mapped a locus for autosomal recessive retinitis
pigmentosa to chromosome 2p24.1-p22.3 in a consanguineous Pakistani
family. By searching for genes in this region, Li et al. (2010)
identified ZNF513. The deduced 541-amino acid protein has 2 N-terminal
nuclear localization signals and 3 C2H2-type zinc finger motifs.
Quantitative RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression in mouse. In mouse
ocular tissues, expression was highest in retina and lowest in lens and
cornea. Retinal expression of mouse Znf513 increased progressively with
age and began to level off between 180 and 300 days. In situ
hybridization of human retina detected ZNF513 in outer nuclear layer,
inner nuclear layer, and ganglion cell layer. Fluorescence-tagged ZNF513
was expressed in dispersed nuclear foci, but not in nucleolus, of
transfected COS-7 cells.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Li et al. (2010) mapped the ZNF513 gene to
chromosome 2p24.1-p22.3

GENE FUNCTION

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis with transfected mouse
fibroblasts, Li et al. (2010) found that human ZNF513 bound a small
subset of sheared DNA. Specifically, ZNF513 associated with the proximal
promoters of the retinal transcription factors Pax6 (607108) and Sp4
(600540) and those of their targets rhodopsin (RHO; 180380), Irbp (RBP3;
180290), Arr3 (301770), and photoreceptor opsins (e.g., OPN1SW; 613522).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a Pakistani family segregating autosomal
recessive retinitis pigmentosa mapping to chromosome 2p24.1-p22.3,
previously studied by Naz et al. (2010), Li et al. (2010) analyzed 33
candidate genes and identified a homozygous mutation in the ZNF513 gene
(C339R; 613598.0001).

ANIMAL MODEL

By database analysis, Li et al. (2010) found that Znf513 is expressed in
early embryonic zebrafish brain and eyes. They showed that knockdown of
Znf513 in zebrafish embryos caused abnormal retinal development with
major effects on photoreceptors, including retinal thinning with
photoreceptor degeneration.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 58
ZNF513, CYS339ARG

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with retinitis
pigmentosa (RP58; 613617), previously studied by Naz et al. (2010), Li
et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 1015T-C transition in exon 4
of the ZNF513 gene, resulting in a cys339-to-arg (C339R) substitution at
a highly conserved residue. The mutation segregated with disease in the
family and was not found in 242 ethnically matched chromosomes.
Functional studies demonstrated that mutant Znf513 transcript failed to
rescue the abnormal retinal development of knockdown zebrafish compared
to wildtype transcript and that the mutant protein failed to bind to the
promoters of retinal-specific genes.

;;KIAA1556;;
KIAA1639
OBSCURIN-RHOGEF, INCLUDED;;
OBSCURIN-MLCK, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned a partial OBSCN cDNA, which they
designated KIAA1556. The protein contains several tandem 88-amino acid
immunoglobulin (Ig)-like repeats and shows significant similarity with
myosin-binding protein C (600958) and titin (188840). RT-PCR ELISA
detected expression in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and whole brain,
with little to no expression in other tissues, including fetal brain.
Within individual brain regions, expression was found only in cerebellum
and caudate nucleus.

Using the peripheral Z disc region of titin as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a skeletal muscle cDNA library, followed by screening a
cardiac muscle cDNA library, Young et al. (2001) cloned OBSCN. The
deduced protein contains 6,620 amino acids and has a calculated
molecular mass of 720 kD. The N terminus consists of 49 Ig and 2
fibronectin (see 135600) type III (FN3) domains, arranged mostly in
tandem, followed by an IQ motif and a complex region consisting of 4
more Ig domains separated by nonmodular sequences. The C terminus
contains an SH3 domain, a Dbl (311030) homology (DH)/RhoGEF domain, a
pleckstrin (173570) homology (PH) domain, 2 tandem Ig domains, and
finally a nonmodular region of 417 amino acids containing several copies
of a consensus ERK kinase (see 176872) phosphorylation motif. Young et
al. (2001) also identified several OBSCN splice variants. Western blot
analysis of human vastus lateralis and cardiac muscle revealed OBSCN at
an apparent molecular mass of 700 to 900 kD. Expression was relatively
low, and OBSCN was estimated to be 10 times less abundant than nebulin
(161650).

Russell et al. (2002) cloned OBSCN from adult and fetal skeletal and
cardiac muscle cDNA libraries. The cDNA sequence encodes 68 Ig domains,
2 fibronectin domains, 1 calcium/calmodulin-binding domain, 1 RhoGEF
domain with an associated PH domain, and 2 serine-threonine kinase (SK)
domains. Russell et al. (2002) also identified 2 polyadenylation sites
within the OBSCN sequence. They determined that alternative splicing
allows the generation of a number of unique obscurin isoforms that
contain various combinations of the functional domains. The
obscurin-RhoGEF/Unc89-like isoforms are comparable to Unc89, a C.
elegans sarcomere-associated protein, in that they contain putative
RhoGEF domains and multiple Ig repeats. The obscurin-MLCK isoforms more
closely resemble myosin light chain kinase (MLCK; 600922) and contain 1
or 2 C-terminal SK domains. Northern blot and PCR analyses detected
several OBSCN transcripts expressed predominantly in heart and skeletal
muscle. In heart, the SK1 and SK2 domain-encoding transcripts were
predominantly expressed without the other functional domains. The RhoGEF
domain-containing transcripts were expressed in heart along with the
fibronectin and immunoglobulin domains at much lower levels than the
SK1- and SK2-encoding transcripts.

GENE FUNCTION

Using several recombinant fragments of titin and OBSCN in yeast 2-hybrid
and in vitro binding assays, Young et al. (2001) determined that Ig
domains 48 and 49 of OBSCN interact directly with the peripheral Z disc
Ig domains Z9 and Z10 of titin. Using the obscurin IQ domain and the
flanking Ig domains 51 and 52 as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, they
found that OBSCN also interacts with full-length calmodulin (see
114180). Binding to calmodulin was Ca(2+) independent. By
immunolocalization of Obscn in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, Young et al.
(2001) determined that obscurin and titin coassemble during
myofibrillogenesis. During the progression of myofibrillogenesis, all
obscurin epitopes became detectable at the M band.

Borisov et al. (2003) studied obscurin expression during myocardial
hypertrophy induced in mice by aortic constriction. Quantitative RT-PCR
indicated that transcripts encoding the RhoGEF domain and the SK2 domain
were both significantly upregulated early in the hypertrophic response
and during hypertrophic growth, although with different temporal
patterns of activation. In contrast, transcripts encoding the SK1 domain
did not undergo dramatic changes in expression following aortic
constriction. Immunolocalization of obscurin-RhoGEF protein in cultured
rat cardiomyocytes pharmacologically induced into hypertrophic growth
indicated that obscurin-RhoGEF was topographically associated with the
growing myofibrils and with the sites of initiation and progression of
myofibrillogenesis at the periphery of the sarcoplasm. Borisov et al.
(2003) concluded that upregulation of obscurin-RhoGEF synthesis is
associated with the formation of additional amounts of contractile
structures during cardiac hypertrophy.

GENE STRUCTURE

Young et al. (2001) determined that the OBSCN gene spans more than 150
kb. Russell et al. (2002) estimated that the OBSCN gene contains at
least 113 exons and spans more than 170 kb.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the OBSCN
gene to chromosome 1. By genomic sequence analysis, Young et al. (2001)
mapped the OBSCN gene to chromosome 1q42. Russell et al. (2002) refined
the mapping of the OBSCN gene to chromosome 1q42.13 using radiation
hybrid and genomic sequence analyses.

603148	TITLE *603148 ACTIVATING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 3; ATF3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

An activating transcription factor (ATF)-binding site is a promoter
element present in a wide variety of viral and cellular genes, including
E1A-inducible adenoviral genes and cAMP-inducible cellular genes. By
screening expression cDNA libraries with a DNA probe containing 3 tandem
ATF-binding sites, Hai et al. (1989) isolated human cDNAs derived from 8
separate genes encoding ATF consensus-binding proteins, including ATF3.
Members of this family share significant sequence similarity within a
leucine zipper DNA-binding motif and an adjacent basic region; the
proteins show little similarity outside of these regions.

By screening a HeLa cell cDNA library with a partial ATF3 cDNA (Hai et
al., 1989), Chen et al. (1994) isolated a full-length ATF3 cDNA. The
deduced protein has 181 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of
22 kD. Chen et al. (1994) also isolated a naturally occurring,
alternatively spliced form of ATF3 cDNA that encodes a truncated ATF3
protein lacking the leucine zipper dimerization domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Using cotransfection studies, Chen et al. (1994) demonstrated that ATF3,
which is a member of the mammalian activation transcription factor/cAMP
responsive element-binding (CREB) protein family of transcription
factors, actually represses transcription from promoters with ATF sites.
The truncated ATF3 variant, which does not bind DNA, stimulates
transcription and antagonizes the action of ATF3. Chen et al. (1994)
presented evidence for a 'cofactor model' of ATF3 repression in which
ATF3 stabilizes the binding of inhibitory cofactors at the promoter.

Using cluster analysis of transcriptome data derived from Tlr4
(603030)-activated mouse macrophages, Gilchrist et al. (2006) identified
a group of genes regulated by Atf3. Network analysis predicted that Atf3
belongs to a transcriptional complex that includes members of the Nfkb
(see 164011) transcription factor family. Promoter analysis, followed by
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and microarray analyses, indicated
an overrepresentation of closely apposed Atf3- and Nfkb-binding sites
within the putative Atf3-regulated genes, which included Il6 (147620)
and Il12b (161561). After activation of mouse macrophages, Atf3 and the
Nfkb component Rel (164910) bound to the regulatory regions of Il6 and
Il12b, with Rel functioning as a transcriptional activator and Atf3
functioning as a negative regulator. Injection of Atf3 -/- mice with
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased circulating levels of Il6, Il12b, and
Tnf (191160) more than 10-fold compared with wildtype mice. ChIP
analysis of LPS-treated wildtype mouse macrophages showed that decreased
histone acetylation coincided with decreased binding of Rel and
increased binding of Atf3 to the Il6 promoter. Histone deacetylation did
not occur in Atf3-deficient mouse macrophages, suggesting that ATF3
inhibits IL6 and IL12B transcription by altering chromatin structure and
restricting access to transcription factors. Gilchrist et al. (2006)
concluded that ATF3 regulates TLR-stimulated inflammatory responses as
part of a negative feedback loop.

Wu et al. (2010) reported that the genetic and pharmacologic suppression
of calcineurin (601302)/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT; see
600489) function promotes tumor formation in mouse skin and in
xenografts, in immune-compromised mice, of H-ras(V12)
(190020.0001)-expressing primary human keratinocytes, or
keratinocyte-derived squamous cell carcinoma cells. Calcineurin/NFAT
inhibition counteracts p53 (191170)-dependent cancer cell senescence,
thereby increasing tumorigenic potential. ATF3, a member of the
'enlarged' AP1 family, is selectively induced by calcineurin/NFAT
inhibition, both under experimental conditions and in clinically
occurring tumors, and increased ATF3 expression accounts for suppression
of p53-dependent senescence and enhanced tumorigenic potential. Thus, Wu
et al. (2010) concluded that intact calcineurin/NFAT signaling is
critically required for p53 and senescence-associated mechanisms that
protect against skin squamous cancer development.

By analysis of whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells,
Hoetzenecker et al. (2012) found that individuals with sepsis had
declining levels of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger,
glutathione (see 601002), that correlated with increased ATF3 levels and
decreased IL6 levels during sepsis-associated immunosuppression (SAIS).
Stimulation of monocytes with endotoxin superinduced NRF2 (NFE2L2;
600492)-dependent ATF3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Rosenberger et al. (2008) found that Atf3-deficient mice had enhanced
protection against murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection, with reduced
liver viral load and hepatic histopathology, compared with wildtype
mice. ChIP analysis showed that Atf3 interacted with a cis regulatory
element of the Ifng gene (147570). Atf3-deficient natural killer (NK)
cells had increased transcription and secretion of Ifng, a factor
involved in protection against MCMV. Reconstitution of NK-deficient mice
with Atf3-deficient NK cells was more effective against MCMV than
replacement with wildtype NK cells. Rosenberger et al. (2008) concluded
that ATF3 acts within NK cells to regulate antiviral responses.

Hoetzenecker et al. (2012) found that mice lacking Atf3 were susceptible
to endotoxic shock, even under conditions of ROS stress. However,
superinduction of Atf3 caused high susceptibility to bacterial and
fungal infections, whereas Atf3 -/- mice were resistant to these
infections. Mice lacking both Atf3 and Il6 were highly susceptible to
bacterial and fungal infections. In a model of SAIS, secondary
infections caused less mortality in Atf3 -/- mice than in wildtype mice.
Hoetzenecker et al. (2012) concluded that ROS-induced ATF3 is crucial in
determining susceptibility to secondary infections during SAIS.

607209	TITLE *607209 CASPASE RECRUITMENT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 10; CARD10
;;CARD-MAGUK PROTEIN 3; CARMA3;;
BCL10-INTERACTING MAGUK PROTEIN 1; BIMP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The caspase recruitment domain (CARD) is a protein module that consists
of 6 or 7 antiparallel alpha helices. It participates in apoptosis
signaling through highly specific protein-protein homophilic
interactions. Like several other CARD proteins, CARD10 belongs to the
membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family and activates
NF-kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011) through BCL10 (603517) (Wang et al.,
2001).

CLONING

By database searching for CARD proteins with high similarity to, and
therefore a greater likelihood of interacting with, BCL10, Gaide et al.
(2001) identified CARD11 (607210), CARD14 (607211), and CARD10, which
they termed CARMA1, CARMA2, and CARMA3, respectively.

Using a mammalian 2-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact
with BCL10 and induce luciferase activity, Wang et al. (2001) identified
CARD10, which interacted selectively with BCL10 and not other CARD
proteins. The deduced 1,032-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal
CARD domain that shares 58% identity with that of CARD11, a central
coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal tripartite structure comprised of a
PDZ domain, an SH3 domain, and a GUK domain. Northern blot analysis
revealed expression of a 4.4-kb transcript in a variety of adult
tissues, including heart, kidney, and liver. CARD10 was also expressed
in fetal lung, liver, and kidney, and in multiple cancer cell lines.

McAllister-Lucas et al. (2001) cloned mouse and human CARD10, which they
termed BIMP1, by EST database searching for clones homologous to the
CARD of CARD9 (607212). The mouse Card10 protein is 90% identical to the
human protein.

GENE FUNCTION

By mutation and immunoprecipitation analyses, Wang et al. (2001)
confirmed that the CARD domain of CARD10 is required for its interaction
with BCL10. Luciferase reporter analysis showed induction of NFKB
activity through IKKG (IKBKG; 300248) or IKKB (IKBKB; 603258), and this
induction required the N terminus of CARD10, as well as its SH3 and PDZ
domains, but not its GUK domain.

By coprecipitation analysis, McAllister-Lucas et al. (2001) showed that
BIMP1, in the presence of BCL10, interacts with MALT1 (604860) and
cooperates in a signaling pathway through a CARD-mediated mechanism.
Analysis of stimulated T cells suggested that BIMP1, through its
interaction with BCL10, functions to couple cell surface receptor
stimulation and protein kinase C (see 176982) activation to the
induction of NFKB.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CARD10
gene to chromosome 22 (TMAP stSG53029).

ANIMAL MODEL

Grabiner et al. (2007) found that Carma3 +/- mice had no developmental
defects, but about 50% of Carma3 -/- mice developed anencephaly, leading
to perinatal mortality. Anencephaly is also present in about 50% of
Bcl10 -/- mice, supporting the hypothesis that CARMA3 and BCL10 function
in the same signal transduction pathway. Using Carma3 -/- mouse
embryonic fibroblasts, Grabiner et al. (2007) showed that Carma3 was
required for G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR; see 600239)-induced
NF-kappa-B activation. The defect was specific, because other stimuli,
such as Tnf-alpha (TNF; 191160), lipopolysaccharide, and extracellular
matrix proteins, activated NF-kappa-B in Carma3 -/- cells. Grabiner et
al. (2007) concluded that CARMA3 is involved in a GPCR-induced signaling
pathway leading to NF-kappa-B activation.

;;HISTONE ACETYLTRANSFERASE MYST4; MYST4;;
MONOCYTIC LEUKEMIA ZINC FINGER PROTEIN-RELATED FACTOR; MORF
MORF/CBF FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Champagne et al. (1999) identified and characterized monocytic leukemia
zinc finger protein-related factor (MORF), a novel human histone
acetyltransferase. MORF is a 1,781-residue protein that is ubiquitously
expressed in adult human tissues. MORF also contains a strong
transcriptional repression domain at its N terminus and a highly potent
activation domain at its C terminus, and may be involved in both
positive and negative regulation of transcription.

Using immunohistochemistry on mice of various developmental ages,
Campeau et al. (2012) demonstrated expression of Myst4 in the
telencephalic vesicles, trigeminal ganglion, spinal cord, dorsal root
ganglia, digestive tract, pancreas, liver, and ribs of developing
embryo; after birth, it is strongly expressed in the diaphysis of the
long bones, the kidney, and the patella, among other organs.

- MORF/CBP Fusion Gene

Panagopoulos et al. (2001) reported a novel t(10;16)(q22;p13)
chromosomal translocation in a childhood acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML-M5a) leading to a MORF-CBP (600140) chimera. RT-PCR experiments
yielded in-frame MORF-CBP and CBP-MORF fusion transcripts. Genomic
analyses revealed that the breaks were close to Alu elements in intron
16 of MORF and intron 2 of CBP and that duplications had occurred near
the breakpoints. The authors constructed an exon/intron map of the MORF
gene. The MORF-CBP protein retained the zinc fingers, 2 nuclear
localization signals, the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain, a
portion of the acidic domain of MORF, and the CBP protein downstream of
codon 29. The part of CBP encoding the RARA-binding domain, the
CREB-binding domain, the 3 cys/his-rich regions, the bromodomain, the
HAT domain and the glu-rich domains was present. In the reciprocal
CBP-MORF, part of the acidic domain, and the C-terminal ser- and
met-rich regions of MORF may be driven by the CBP promoter.

MAPPING

Champagne et al. (1999) mapped the MORF gene to chromosome 10q22 by
FISH.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Clayton-Smith et al. (2011) studied a cohort of 19 individuals with a
presumed diagnosis of the Ohdo syndrome SBBYS variant (SBBYSS; 603736).
Twelve individuals were considered to have typical features of the
syndrome, 2 had suggestive but milder features, and 5 were classified as
atypical. By whole-exome sequencing in 4 individuals with typical
features, Clayton-Smith et al. (2011) identified heterozygous mutations
in the KAT6B gene: a nonsense mutation (E1357X; 605880.0004) in
individual 4, a 1-bp insertion (605880.0001) in individual 1, and a 2-bp
deletion (605880.0002) in individual 2. Subsequently, all 19 individuals
with an SBBYSS or an SBBYSS-like phenotype were sequenced for the entire
KAT6B coding region by classic Sanger sequencing. Truncating mutations
in exon 18 of the KAT6B gene were confirmed in 12 individuals, and
individual 3 was found to have a heterozygous frameshift mutation in
exon 15 (605880.0003), which had not been detected on whole-exome
sequencing. When parental samples were available, the mutations were
shown to have occurred de novo. Clayton-Smith et al. (2011) suggested
that mutations of protein-protein interaction domains in exon 18 result
in a more complex phenotype than the phenotype due to simple
haploinsufficiency of KAT6B and raised the possibility that exon 18
mutations are activating or have a dominant-negative effect.

In 6 patients with genitopatellar syndrome (GTPTS; 606170), Campeau et
al. (2012) identified 5 different heterozygous de novo truncating
mutations in exon 18 of the KAT6B gene (605880.0005-605880.0009), all of
which were predicted to result in loss of the highly conserved
transcription activation domain. Campeau et al. (2012) noted that
SBBYSS, also caused by mutation in KAT6B, is a disorder with features
overlapping those of genitopatellar syndrome, but with clinical
differences.

Simpson et al. (2012) identified mutations in the KAT6B gene in 5
unrelated patients with genitopatellar syndrome (see, e.g., 605880.0006
and 605880.0010); they stated that the form of Ohdo syndrome (SBBYSS) in
which mutations in KAT6B had been found is phenotypically distinct from
genitopatellar syndrome.

In 2 children with clinical features of SBBYSS, including a 4-year-old
girl previously reported by Szakszon et al. (2011), Szakszon et al.
(2013) identified different de novo truncating mutations in the distal
region of exon 18 of the KAT6B gene (605880.0011-605880.0012).

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Szakszon et al. (2013) noted that truncating mutations of KAT6B exon 18
between positions c.3018 and c.3892 had been shown to cause GTPTS,
whereas truncating mutations distal to position c.4069 in the same exon
cause SBBYSS (with one exception, a c.4360_4368delins mutation in a
patient with GTPTS; see 605880.0005). They stated that their finding of
truncating mutations of KAT6B exon 18 at positions c.5064_5071
(605880.0011) and c.5389 (605880.0012) in patients with SBBYSS confirmed
this genotype-phenotype correlation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Clayton-Smith et al. (2011) examined mice carrying a gene trap insertion
in the mouse ortholog Kat6b (Qkf/Myst4/Morf) that produces approximately
5% of the normal amount of Kat6b mRNA. The Qkf gt/gt hypomorphic mutant
displayed a number of defects that mirror SBBYSS syndrome, although the
phenotype in the mice is milder. Mice are of normal size at birth but
fail to thrive and have brain developmental defects as well as
craniofacial defects. Observed abnormalities include short and narrow
palpebral fissures, low set ears, and malocclusion. Qkf mRNA is strongly
expressed in the eyelids and teeth primordia during development. Similar
to individuals with SBBYSS, the Qkf gt/gt mice have long, slender feet
and disproportionately long first digits.

608487	TITLE *608487 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5; TRIM5
;;RNF88
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRIM5 belongs to the large tripartite motif protein family, members of
which typically are composed of 3 zinc-binding domains, a RING, unique
B-box type 1 and B-box type 2 domains, followed by a coiled-coil (CC)
region. TRIM proteins use homomultimerization to identify specific cell
compartments.

CLONING

Using a consensus B-box domain to screen dbEST databases, Reymond et al.
(2001) identified 37 TRIM members in mammals, 21 of which were novel, as
well as 34 splice variants. TRIM5 has 6 variants termed alpha, beta,
gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta, all of which lack a B-box type 1
domain. Additional domains C-terminal to the CC region are variably
present. TRIM5-zeta lacks RING, B-box, and CC domains, but possesses 3
RFP-like domains. Northern blot analysis of adult human tissues detected
ubiquitous expression of TRIM5. Using interaction mating and mutation
analysis, Reymond et al. (2001) confirmed that TRIM5, like most TRIMs,
homointeracts through the CC region. Interaction was also detected with
TRIM6 (607564). Green fluorescent protein microscopy demonstrated
expression as cytoplasmic speckles, possibly in novel subcellular
compartments.

Stremlau et al. (2004) determined that human TRIM5-alpha contains 493
amino acids and includes a C-terminal b30.2 (SPRY) domain missing in
other TRIM5 isoforms.

GENE FUNCTION

By fluorescence microscopy and mutation analysis, Xu et al. (2003)
showed that TRIM5-delta interacts with BTBD1 (608530) and BTBD2
(608531), apparently serving as a scaffold for the assembly of
endogenous BTBD1/2 proteins, dependent on the presence of the CC region
and a wildtype RING domain. TRIM5-delta exhibits ubiquitylation in the
presence of UBCH5B (UBE2D2; 602962), dependent on the presence of
zinc-coordinating cysteines in the RING domain.

Kaiser et al. (2007) reported the reconstruction of the core protein of
a 4-million-year-old endogenous virus from the chimpanzee genome
(PtERV1) and showed that the human variant of the intrinsic immune
protein TRIM5-alpha can actively prevent infection by this virus.
However, Kaiser et al. (2007) suggested that the selective changes that
have occurred in the human lineage during the acquisition of resistance
to this virus, and perhaps similar viruses, may have left our species
more susceptible to infection by HIV-1.

Pertel et al. (2011) demonstrated that TRIM5 promotes innate immune
signaling and that this activity is amplified by retroviral infection
and interaction with the capsid lattice. Acting with the heterodimeric
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13-UEV1A, TRIM5 catalyzes the synthesis
of unattached K63-linked ubiquitin chains that activate the TAK1
(602614) kinase complex and stimulate AP1 (see 165160) and NF-kappa-B
(see 164011) signaling. Interaction with the HIV-1 capsid lattice
greatly enhanced the UBC13-UEV1A-dependent E3 activity of TRIM5, and
challenge with retroviruses induced the transcription of AP1- and
NF-kappa-B-dependent factors with a magnitude that tracked with TRIM5
avidity for the invading capsid. Finally, TAK1 and UBC13-UEV1A
contributed to capsid-specific restriction by TRIM5. Pertel et al.
(2011) concluded that the retroviral restriction factor TRIM5 has 2
additional activities that are linked to restriction: it constitutively
promotes innate immune signaling, and it acts as a pattern recognition
receptor specific for the retrovirus capsid lattice.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Reymond et al. (2001) mapped the TRIM5
gene to chromosome 11p15, in a cluster with TRIM6, TRIM21 (109092),
TRIM22 (606559), TRIM34 (605684), and a TRIM pseudogene. The authors
noted that, apart from another cluster in the HLA region (chromosome
6p21-23), TRIM genes are dispersed throughout the genome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Stremlau et al. (2004) noted that HIV-1, the cause of acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans, efficiently enters the cells
of Old World monkeys but encounters a block before reverse
transcription. The block acts on the HIV-1 capsid and is mediated by a
dominant repressive factor. By screening HeLa cell lines transduced with
a cDNA library from rhesus fibroblasts, Stremlau et al. (2004)
identified HeLa cells expressing rhesus TRIM5-alpha. These cells were
resistant to HIV-1 but not simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)
infection. PCR analysis indicated a disruption of viral cDNA synthesis
in rhesus TRIM5-alpha-expressing cells. Mutation analysis suggested that
both the N-terminal RING and C-terminal SPRY domains of rhesus
TRIM5-alpha contribute to its HIV-1 inhibitory activity. Short
interfering (si) RNA experiments reducing rhesus TRIM5-alpha expression
resulted in increased efficiency of HIV-1 infection. Stremlau et al.
(2004) concluded that monkey TRIM5-alpha is the repressive factor
inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcription and proposed that rhesus
TRIM5-alpha may directly bind and ubiquitinate the HIV-1 viral capsid.

Sayah et al. (2004) showed that knockdown of owl monkey CYPA (123840) by
RNA interference (RNAi) correlated with suppression of anti-HIV-1
activity. However, reintroduction of CYPA to RNAi-treated cells did not
restore antiviral activity. A search for additional RNAi targets
identified TRIMCYP, an RNAi-responsive mRNA encoding a TRIM5/CYPA fusion
protein. TRIMCYP accounts for post-entry restriction of HIV-1 in owl
monkeys and blocks HIV-1 infection when transferred to otherwise
infectable human or rat cells. Sayah et al. (2004) suggested that
TRIMCYP arose after the divergence of New and Old World primates when a
LINE-1 retrotransposon catalyzed the insertion of a CYPA cDNA into the
TRIM5 locus. They concluded that this was the first vertebrate example
of a chimeric gene generated by this mechanism of exon shuffling.

Sakuma et al. (2007) showed that rhesus Trim5-alpha, but not human
TRIM5-alpha, blocked late-phase HIV-1 production through rapid
degradation of HIV-1 Gag polyproteins. In agreement with Sakuma et al.
(2007), Zhang et al. (2008) found that rhesus Trim5-alpha could block
late-stage HIV-1, but not macaque SIV, production. However, the amount
of Trim5-alpha required for this effect was much higher than that
endogenously expressed, and they questioned the biologic significance of
the finding. In a reply, Sakuma et al. (2008) suggested that technical
differences, such as cell lines and capsid sequences, may explain the
need for high Trim5-alpha expression in the experiments of Zhang et al.
(2008).

160993	TITLE *160993 N-MYRISTOYLTRANSFERASE 1; NMT1
;;MYRISTOYL-CoA:PROTEIN N-MYRISTOYLTRANSFERASE; NMT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Myristate, a rare 14-carbon saturated fatty acid, is cotranslationally
attached by an amide linkage to the N-terminal glycine residue of
cellular and viral proteins with diverse functions.
N-myristoyltransferase (NMT; EC 2.3.1.97) catalyzes the transfer of
myristate from CoA to proteins. N-myristoylation appears to be
irreversible and is required for full expression of the biologic
activities of several N-myristoylated proteins, including the alpha
subunit of the signal-transducing guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G
protein) GO (GNAO1; 139311) (Duronio et al., 1992).

CLONING

Insertional mutagenesis of the Nmt1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
causes recessive lethality, indicating that N-myristoylation provides an
essential function for one or more of the approximately 12 proteins of
this yeast that are substrates for Nmt1. Duronio et al. (1992) isolated
cDNAs encoding human NMT by complementing a point mutation of this gene
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that causes temperature-sensitive myristic
acid auxotrophy. Human NMT is encoded by a single-copy gene, contains
416 amino acids, and is 44% identical to the yeast NMT.

Giang and Cravatt (1998) identified human and mouse cDNAs encoding NMT1
and NMT2 (603801). The predicted 496-amino acid human NMT1 protein
shares 77% and 97% sequence identity with human NMT2 and mouse Nmt1,
respectively. Western analysis revealed that there are 4 isoforms of
NMT1 with apparent molecular masses ranging from 49 to 68 kD. In cell
fractionation studies, the 68-kD NMT1 isoform and NMT2 were present in
both membrane and cytoplasmic fractions, while the smaller NMT1 isoforms
were predominantly cytoplasmic. The authors suggested that the
membranous NMTs may reflect the association of these cotranslational
processing proteins with ribosomes that are themselves bound to
membranes. Northern blot analysis showed that both NMT1 and NMT2 were
expressed in most human and mouse tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Giang and Cravatt (1998) found that both NMT1 and NMT2 myristoylated
several commonly studied peptide substrates with similar, but
distinguishable, relative selectivities when expressed in mammalian
cells.

ANIMAL MODEL

In intercrosses of Nmt1 +/- mice, Yang et al. (2005) obtained no viable
Nmt1 -/- pups, and Nmt1 +/- pups were born at less than predicted
frequency. Nmt1 -/- embryos died between embryonic days 3.5 and 7.5.
Stem cells developed from Nmt1 -/- embryos yielded small embryoid bodies
in in vitro differentiation experiments and did not contribute normally
to organogenesis in chimeric mice, indicating that they were
functionally abnormal. Nmt2 expression was lower during early embryonic
development than at later time points, and total Nmt activity levels
were reduced by about 95% in Nmt1 -/- embryonic stem cells. Yang et al.
(2005) concluded that NMT1 is the principal N-methyltransferase in early
embryogenesis, and that NMT2 is unlikely to rescue NMT1 deficiency.

;;TCEB3A;;
ELONGIN A;;
ELONGIN A1;;
ELONGIN, 110-KD SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION Eukaryotic transcription and mRNA synthesis are complex biochemical
processes controlled in part by the concerted action of a set of general
transcription factors that regulate the activity of RNA polymerase II
(see 180660) at both the initiation and elongation stages of
transcription. Aso et al. (1995) noted that several general initiation
factors, including TFIIA (see 600520), TFIIB (189963), TFIID (see
313650), TFIIE (see 189962), and TFIIH (see 189972), and several
accessory proteins (e.g., TAFs; see 600475), have been identified in
eukaryotic cells and found to promote selective binding of RNA
polymerase II to promoters and to support a basal level of
transcription.

In addition to the general initiation factors, 3 general elongation
factors, SII (601425), TFIIF, and elongin (SIII), have been defined
biochemically in eukaryotes and shown to increase the overall rate at
which RNA polymerase II transcribes duplex DNA. TFIIF from higher
eukaryotes is a heterodimer composed of RAP74, a subunit of
approximately 70 kD (189968) and RAP30 (189969), a subunit of
approximately 30 kD. Elongin (also referred to as SIII) is a
heterotrimer composed of A (TCEB3), B (600787), and C (600788) subunits
of 110, 18, and 15 kD, respectively. The complex activates elongation of
mammalian RNA polymerase II by suppressing transient pausing of the
polymerase at many sites within transcription units. Aso et al. (1995)
isolated the rat elongin A gene, expressed the gene, and reconstituted
the elongin complex with recombinant subunits. They showed that elongin
A functions as the transcriptionally active component of the complex and
elongin B and C as regulatory subunits. Whereas elongin C assembled with
elongin A to form an AC complex with increased specific activity,
elongin B, a member of the ubiquitin-homology gene family, appeared to
serve a chaperone-like function, facilitating assembly and enhancing
stability of the elongin complex. (The genes encoding elongins A, B, and
C are also symbolized TCEB3, TCEB2, and TCEB1, respectively.)

Aso et al. (1996) described a full-length cDNA encoding the human
homolog. The predicted 722-amino acid protein shares 84% homology with
the rat protein. Comparison of the open reading frames of the human cDNA
with that of the previously characterized rat cDNA indicated that they
are 84% conserved in nucleotide sequence.

Duan et al. (1995) and Kibel et al. (1995) reported results suggesting
that the tumor suppression activity of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor
suppressor gene product (VHL; 608537) is a function of its ability to
bind to TCEB2 and TCEB1 and inhibit transcription elongation.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Aso et al. (1995) mapped the
TCEB3 gene to 1p36.1. They pointed out that this region has been shown
to have deletions in several forms of malignancy.

;;NEUROTROPHIC TYROSINE KINASE RECEPTOR-RELATED 3; NTRKR3;;
TYROSINE KINASE RECEPTOR RELATED TO NEUROTROPHIC TRK; TKT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a PCR-mediated approach, Karn et al. (1993) characterized cDNAs
from human and mouse representing a novel type of receptor protein
tyrosine kinase (RTK). The deduced 855-amino acid sequence of the
longest ORF has a unique extracellular region encompassing a factor
VIII-like domain, not previously described for RTKs. The most closely
related RTKs are members of the neurotrophin receptors (TRKs; see TRKA,
191315), which show 47 to 49% homology with the kinase domain of the
novel RTK. Therefore, Karn et al. (1993) called the novel gene TKT
(pronounced 'ticket') for 'tyrosine-kinase related to TRK.' TKT
orthologs from man and mouse are 98% similar. Northern blot analysis
detected a 10-kb transcript that was highly expressed in heart and lung,
with lower expression in brain, placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, and
kidney. In mouse, highest expression was also detected in heart and
lung, with lower expression in brain and testis.

Using in situ hybridization with 1-week-old mice, Labrador et al. (2001)
found that Ddr2 was expressed along chondrocyte columns in the
proliferative region of the growth plate. Ddr2 mRNA was also present,
although dispersed, at areas of calcified cartilage in the
cartilage-bone junction, as well as in the trabecular bone surface. Ddr2
protein was detected in most mouse tissues examined. Highest levels of
phosphorylated Ddr2 were detected in lung, ovary, and skin, which did
not correlate with Ddr2 protein levels.

MAPPING

By analysis of human/mouse somatic cell hybrids using PCR with primers
that amplified human but not mouse genomic DNA, Karn et al. (1993)
demonstrated that the TKT gene segregates with human chromosome 1 and is
located in the region 1q12-qter.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bargal et al. (2009) mapped the short limb-hand type of
spondyloepiphyseal-metaphyseal dysplasia (SMED-SL; 271665) to a region
on chromosome 1 that included that DDR2 gene. They considered DDR2 to be
a strong candidate for the disorder because of the similarity between
the phenotype of the Ddr2 knockout mouse and that of SMED-SL patients.
In 8 patients from 7 different consanguineous families with SMED-SL,
they identified homozygous missense mutations in exon 17 of the DDR2
gene: an R752C substitution (191311.0001) in 6 Arab Muslims living in
the Jerusalem area, an I726R (191311.0002) substitution in 1 Algerian,
and a T713I (191311.0003) substitution in 1 Pakistani. Bargal et al.
(2009) also identified a splice site mutation (191311.0004) in the DDR2
gene, which resulted in the skipping of exon 17, in one of the Jewish
families with SMED-SL originally reported by Borochowitz et al. (1993).
All of the mutations occurred in the active site of the DDR2 tyrosine
kinase domain.

Ali et al. (2010) reported homozygous DDR2 missense mutations in 2
consanguineous families with SMED-SL in the United Arab Emirates. One
was a novel mutation (E113K; 191311.0005) in 2 sibs from a family of
Pakistani origin, and the other the R752C mutation (191311.0001) in 2
Egyptian sibs. The authors expressed DDR2 constructs with the identified
point mutations in human cell lines and evaluated their localization and
functional properties. All SMED-SL missense mutants were defective in
collagen-induced receptor activation, and the 3 missense mutations
reported by Bargal et al. (2009) were retained in the endoplasmic
reticulum. In contrast, the novel mutation trafficked normally but
failed to bind collagen.

ANIMAL MODEL

Labrador et al. (2001) obtained Ddr2 -/- mice at the expected mendelian
ratio. Ddr2 -/- mice appeared normal at birth, but they failed to
thrive, resulting in proportionate smaller body size and reduced body
mass. They developed a progressive skeletal phenotype characterized by
shortening of long bones, irregular growth of flat bones, and shorter
snout. Reduced bone growth in Ddr2 -/- mice appeared to be due to
reduced chondrocyte proliferation rather than apoptosis or a defect in
chondrocyte differentiation. Ddr2 -/- embryonic fibroblasts and Ddr2 -/-
adult skin fibroblasts proliferated more slowly and showed a diminished
wounding response compared with wildtype fibroblasts.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPONDYLOMETAEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, SHORT LIMB-HAND TYPE
DDR2, ARG752CYS

In 6 patients with the short limb-hand type of spondylometaepiphyseal
dysplasia (271665) from 5 Arab Muslim families living in the Jerusalem
area, Bargal et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for a 2254C-T
transition in exon 17 of the DDR2 gene, resulting in an arg752-to-cys
(R752C) substitution. All of the parents were heterozygous for the
mutation, which was not found in 200 chromosomes of matched healthy
unrelated individuals. Haplotype analysis indicated that this is a
founder mutation.

Ali et al. (2010) found that the 2 affected sibs from the consanguineous
Egyptian family originally reported by Al-Gazali et al. (1996) carried
the R752C mutation in homozygosity. Both sibs died, one of respiratory
failure at age 13 years and the other of cord compression at age 8
years. In severity the phenotype was similar to the patients described
by Bargal et al. (2009).

Ali et al. (2010) expressed R752C mutant protein in human cells and
found that it was retained in endoplasmic reticulum and was defective in
collagen-induced receptor activation.

for a 2177T-G transversion in exon 17 of the DDR2 gene, resulting in an
ile726-to-arg (I726R) substitution. The parents were heterozygous for
the mutation, which was not found in 200 chromosomes of matched healthy
unrelated individuals.

Ali et al. (2010) expressed I726R mutant protein in human cells and
found that it was retained in endoplasmic reticulum and was defective in

for a 2138C-T transition in exon 17 of the DDR2 gene, resulting in a
thr713-to-ile (T713I) substitution. The parents were heterozygous for
the mutation, which was not found in 200 chromosomes of matched healthy
unrelated individuals.

Ali et al. (2010) expressed T713I mutant protein in human cells and
found that it was retained in endoplasmic reticulum and was defective in
collagen-induced receptor activation.

consanguineous Jewish families with spondylometaepiphyseal dysplasia,
short limb-hand type (271665), described by Borochowitz et al. (1993),
Bargal et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for an IVS17+1G-A
mutation in the DDR2 gene, which resulted in the skipping of exon 17.

.0005
SPONDYLOMETAEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, SHORT LIMB-HAND TYPE
DDR2, GLU113LYS

In 2 brothers from a consanguineous Pakistani family with
spondylometaepiphyseal dysplasia, short limb-hand type (271665), Ali et
al. (2010) detected homozygosity for a c.337G-A transition in DDR2
resulting in a glu-to-lys substitution at codon 113 (E113K). The E113K
mutation is located in the extracellular discoidin domain and affects a
surface-exposed residue important in the DDR2 collagen-binding site. The
brothers had bowing of lower limbs in addition to short limbs and hands.
Both had repeated respiratory infections. Neurologic development was
normal in both.

Ali et al. (2010) expressed E113K mutant protein in human cells and
found that, while it trafficked normally, it was defective in
collagen-induced receptor activation and failed to bind collagen.

185880	TITLE *185880 VESICLE-ASSOCIATED MEMBRANE PROTEIN 1; VAMP1
;;SYNAPTOBREVIN 1; SYB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Synaptobrevins 1 and 2 (185881) are small integral membrane proteins
specific for synaptic vesicles in neurons.

CLONING

Archer et al. (1990) isolated and characterized cosmid clones containing
the human genes encoding synaptobrevins 1 and 2. Their coding regions
are highly homologous, being interrupted at identical positions by
introns of different size and sequence.

GENE STRUCTURE

The genes encoding synaptobrevins 1 and 2 have 5 exons whose boundaries
correspond to those of the protein domains (Archer et al., 1990). Exon 1
contains part of the initiator methionine codon, whereas exon 2 encodes
the variable and immunogenic amino-terminal domain. The third exon
comprises the highly conserved central domain, exon 4 encodes most of
the transmembrane region, and exon 5 contains the last residues of the
transmembrane region and the small intravesicular carboxyl terminus.

GENE FUNCTION

Neuronal exocytosis is triggered by calcium and requires 3 SNARE
proteins: synaptobrevin on the synaptic vesicle, and syntaxin (e.g.,
186590) and SNAP25 (600322) on the plasma membrane. Neuronal SNARE
proteins form a parallel 4-helix bundle that is thought to drive the
fusion of opposing membranes. Hu et al. (2002) demonstrated that whereas
syntaxin and SNAP25 in target membranes are freely available for SNARE
complex formation, availability of synaptobrevin on synaptic vesicles is
very limited. Calcium at micromolar concentrations triggers SNARE
complex formation and fusion between synaptic vesicles and reconstituted
target membranes. Although calcium does promote interaction of SNARE
proteins between opposing membranes, it does not act by releasing
synaptobrevin from synaptic vesicle restriction. Hu et al. (2002)
concluded that their data suggests a mechanism in which
calcium-triggered membrane apposition enables syntaxin and SNAP25 to
engage synaptobrevin, leading to membrane fusion.

Tucker et al. (2004) investigated the effect of synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1;
185605) on membrane fusion mediated by neuronal SNARE proteins SNAP25,
syntaxin, and synaptobrevin, which were reconstituted into vesicles. In
the presence of calcium, the cytoplasmic domain of SYT1 strongly
stimulated membrane fusion when synaptobrevin densities were similar to
those found in native synaptic vesicles. The calcium dependence of
SYT1-stimulated fusion was modulated by changes in lipid composition of
the vesicles and by a truncation that mimics cleavage of SNAP25 by
botulinum neurotoxin A. Stimulation of fusion was abolished by
disrupting the calcium-binding activity, or by severing the tandem C2
domains, of SYT1. Thus, SYT1 and SNAREs are likely to represent the
minimal protein complement for calcium-triggered exocytosis.

By use of the large calyx of Held presynaptic terminal from rats, Sakaba
et al. (2005) demonstrated that cleavage of different SNARE proteins by
clostridial neurotoxins caused distinct kinetic changes in
neurotransmitter release. When elevating calcium ion concentration
directly at the presynaptic terminal with the use of caged calcium,
cleavage of SNAP25 by botulinum toxin A produced a strong reduction in
the calcium sensitivity for release, whereas cleavage of syntaxin using
botulinum toxin C1 and synaptobrevin using tetanus toxin produced an all
or nothing block without changing the kinetics of remaining vesicles.
When stimulating release by calcium influx through channels, a
difference between botulinum toxin C1 and tetanus toxin emerged, which
suggests that cleavage of synaptobrevin modifies the coupling between
channels and release-competent vesicles.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids, Archer et al.
(1990) assigned the SYB1 gene to 12p; by analysis of DNA from Chinese
hamster-mouse somatic cell hybrids, they mapped the Syb1 gene to mouse
chromosome 6.

ANIMAL MODEL

The 'lethal-wasting' (lew) mouse is a spontaneous autosomal recessive
mutant that manifests as a neurologic phenotype characterized by
generalized lack of movement, wasting and prewean death by age 15 days.
By positional cloning, Nystuen et al. (2007) determined that the lew
phenotype results from a 190G-T transversion in the coding region of the
Vamp1 gene, predicted to result in truncation of nearly half of the
protein. Western blot analysis showed no detectable Vamp1 protein in
mutant mice. The authors noted that the phenotype was milder than that
of Vamp2 (185881)-null mice, which die at birth. By immunostudies of
normal mice, Nystuen et al. (2007) showed that Vamp1 is expressed
primarily in certain neuronal tissues, including the retina and areas of
the diencephalon and midbrain such as the zona incerta (subthalamus) and
rostral periolivary region. The findings suggested that Vamp1 has a
vital role in a subset of central nervous system tissues.

607442	TITLE *607442 ECHINODERM MICROTUBULE ASSOCIATED PROTEIN LIKE-4; EML4
;;ROPP120
EML4-ALK FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Heidebrecht et al. (2000) purified a 120-kD protein that was highly
expressed in mitotic Hodgkin lymphoma (236000) cells. Using degenerate
primers designed from the amino acid sequence for PCR amplification,
followed by an EST database search, they cloned the full-length EML4
cDNA, which they called ROPP120 (restrictedly overexpressed
proliferation-associated protein of 120 kD). The deduced 981-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 109 kD. It contains 4 WD
repeats in the C terminus, a trypsin-like serine protease active site, a
histidine acid phosphate site, an EF-hand calcium-binding domain, 6
N-glycosylation sites, and more than 20 putative phosphorylation sites.
EML4 shares 56% sequence identity with EML1 (602033) and 57% with the
echinoderm microtubule-associated protein.

- EML4/ALK Fusion Gene

Soda et al. (2007) showed that a small inversion within chromosome 2p
results in the formation of a fusion gene comprising portions of the
EML4 gene and the ALK gene (105590) in nonsmall cell lung cancer
(211980) cells. Mouse 3T3 fibroblasts forced to express this human
fusion tyrosine kinase generated transformed foci in culture and
subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. Soda et al. (2007) detected the
EML4-ALK fusion transcript was detected in 5 of 75 (6.7%) Japanese
patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer patients examined; none of these
patients had a mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene
(EGFR; 131550). The fusion gene encoded a deduced 1,059-amino acid
protein with an N-terminal portion (residues 1-496) identical to that of
human EML4 and a C-terminal portion (residues 497-1059) identical to the
intracellular domain (residues 1058-1620) of human ALK.

MAPPING

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a cDNA expression library for clones that permitted
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in HEK293 cells expressing
Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-1 (293EBNA cells), followed by
5-prime RACE of a normal liver cDNA library, Yeh et al. (2001) cloned
ADI1, which they called SIPL. The transcript contains a short upstream
ORF in addition to the major ORF. The deduced protein shares significant
similarity with rice Sip, which is induced by submergence in water.
Database analysis revealed a putative splice variant encoding a protein
with 63 additional N-terminal amino acids, which Yeh et al. (2001)
called 'extended SIPL' (ESIPL). Northern blot analysis failed to detect
SIPL in any tissue; however, RT-PCR followed by Southern blot analysis
detected SIPL in all normal and tumor tissues examined. ESIPL
transcripts were detected only in skeletal muscle and in hepatocellular
carcinoma, ovarian cancer, and placenta choriocarcinoma. Epitope-tagged
SIPL was expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of transfected 293
cells, with perinuclear or nuclear clustering in some cells. Database
analysis revealed SIPL orthologs in all organisms examined, including
prokaryotes.

GENE FUNCTION

Yeh et al. (2001) showed that 293EBNA cells expressing SIPL were
permissive for HCV infection, while untransfected cells were not.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Uekita et al. (2004) found that the
isolated C-terminal tail of MMP14 (600754) interacted with MTCBP1.
MTCBP1 colocalized with MMP14 at the cell membrane, but it was also
detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus. MTCBP1 inhibited the activity of
MMP14 to promote cell migration and invasion.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the ADI1 gene to chromosome 2p25.3 based on an
alignment of the ADI1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK001775) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;LEUCINE AMINOPEPTIDASE OF PLACENTA;;
OXYTOCINASE;;
INSULIN-RESPONSIVE AMINOPEPTIDASE, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; IRAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Beckman et al. (1966) found 3 placental leucine aminopeptidase (LAP)
types. (LAP enzymes in the serum of pregnant women probably are not
derived from placenta.) Beckman et al. (1969) stated a preference for
the designation amino acid naphthylamidase. The serum level of placental
LAP increases during pregnancy and degrades several peptide hormones
such as oxytocin (167050) and vasopressin (192340).

Rogi et al. (1996) cloned a human placenta cDNA encoding leucyl-cystinyl
aminopeptidase, which they symbolized PLAP. The deduced 944-amino acid
polypeptide contains the HEXXH consensus sequence of zinc
metallopeptidases as well as an N-terminal hydrophobic region that
resembles a transmembrane domain. Northern blot analysis detected
expression of 3.6-kb and 10.5-kb transcripts in placenta, heart, and
skeletal muscle, and a 10.5-kb transcript in brain. Using
immunohistochemistry, Nagasaka et al. (1997) localized LNPEP to
syncytiotrophoblasts in placenta as well as in fetal and adult vascular
endothelial cells, the epithelial lining of several organs, neurons, and
sweat gland cells; adult seminal vesicles and prostate; and fetal
adipocytes and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

In muscle and fat cells, insulin (INS; 176730) stimulation activates a
signaling cascade that causes intracellular vesicles containing glucose
transporter-4 (GLUT4, or SLC2A4; 138190) to translocate to and fuse with
the plasma membrane. Using mass spectrometry, Larance et al. (2005)
identified Irap as a major membrane protein associated with Glut4
vesicles in cultured mouse adipocytes. The Rab GTPase-activating protein
As160 (TBC1D4; 612465), another major constituent of Glut4 vesicles,
interacted directly with the cytoplasmic tail of Irap in vitro and in
vivo. Since As160 dissociated from Glut4 vesicles upon insulin
stimulation, Larance et al. (2005) concluded that interaction between
AS160 and IRAP mediates association of AS160 with GLUT4 vesicles.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules present
peptides, produced through cytosolic proteasomal degradation of cellular
proteins, to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In dendritic cells, the peptides
can also be derived from internalized antigens through a process known
as crosspresentation. Saveanu et al. (2009) identified a role for
peptide trimming by IRAP in crosspresentation. In human dendritic cells,
IRAP was localized to a Rab14+ endosomal storage compartment in which it
interacted with MHC class I molecules. IRAP deficiency compromised
crosspresentation in vitro and in vivo but did not affect endogenous
presentation. Saveanu et al. (2009) proposed the existence of 2 pathways
for proteasome-dependent crosspresentation in which final peptide
trimming involves IRAP in endosomes and involves the related
aminopeptidases in the endoplasmic reticulum.

GENE STRUCTURE

Horio et al. (1999) isolated and sequenced genomic clones containing the
upstream region of LNPEP and identified 4 GC-rich sequences, a TATA box,
and 3 half palindromic estrogen-responsive element (ERE)-like motifs.

MAPPING

By FISH, Horio et al. (1999) mapped the LNPEP gene to chromosome
5q14.2-q15.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mouse Irap, a zinc-dependent membrane aminopeptidase, is the homolog of
human LNPEP. Keller et al. (2002) characterized Irap-null mice with
regard to glucose homeostasis and regulation of the insulin-responsive
glucose transporter Glut4 (138190). Irap-null mice maintained normal
glucose homeostasis despite decreased glucose uptake into muscle and fat
cells. The absence of Irap did not affect the subcellular distribution
of Glut4 in adipocytes, but it led to a substantial decrease in Glut4
expression.

606100	TITLE *606100 EGF-LIKE MODULE-CONTAINING, MUCIN-LIKE HORMONE RECEPTOR 2; EMR2
DESCRIPTION Epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530)-7-transmembrane (TM7) proteins are
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) found on monocytes and neutrophils.
They include mouse F4/80, mouse and human CD97 (601211), and EMR1
(600493), the likely human homolog of F4/80. EGF-TM7 glycoproteins have
variable numbers of N-terminal EGF-like repeats coupled to a family-B
GPCR-related moiety via a mucin-like stalk.

CLONING

By EST database searching, 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, and cDNA library
screening, Lin et al. (2000) obtained cDNAs encoding EMR2 and multiple
splice variants. Sequence analysis predicted that the 823-amino acid
EMR2 protein has an N-terminal signal peptide, 5 EGF-like domains, which
are nearly identical to those of CD97, and multiple N- and
O-glycosylation sites. EGF domains 2 through 5 have calcium-binding
sequences likely to play important roles in protein-protein
interactions. The spacer domain, which contains a cysteine-rich motif
involved in proteolytic cleavage, and the 248-residue 7-transmembrane
domain are each approximately 46% identical to those of CD97. The
41-amino acid cytoplasmic tail has 4 potential phosphorylation sites.
Northern blot analysis revealed expression of 3.3- and 6.1-kb EMR2
transcripts. Highest expression was found in peripheral blood
leukocytes, followed by spleen and lymph nodes, with intermediate to low
levels in thymus, bone marrow, fetal liver, placenta, and lung, and no
expression in heart, brain, skeletal muscle, kidney, or pancreas. RT-PCR
analysis detected EMR2 expression in monocyte/macrophage and Jurkat cell
lines but not in other cell lines tested, indicating expression of EMR2
is less broad than that observed for CD97. Flow cytometric analysis
demonstrated cross-reactivity with EGF domain-reactive anti-CD97
antibodies and specific reactivity with antibodies against spacer
sequences. Binding analysis, however, showed that EMR2 does not interact
with the CD97 ligand, CD55 (125240), suggesting that the association
between CD97 and CD55 is highly dependent on 3 or fewer amino acids
and/or the more diverse spacer region.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Lin et al. (2000) determined that the EMR2
gene contains 20 exons and spans 45 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lin et al. (2000) localized the EMR2 gene
between the NOTCH3 (600276) and RFX1 (600006) genes on 19p13.1, close to
the other EGF-TM7 genes.

150330	TITLE *150330 LAMIN A/C; LMNA
;;LAMIN A;;
LAMIN C; LMNC
PRELAMIN A, INCLUDED;;
PROGERIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The LMNA gene encodes lamin A and lamin C. Lamins are structural protein
components of the nuclear lamina, a protein network underlying the inner
nuclear membrane that determines nuclear shape and size. The lamins
constitute a class of intermediate filaments. Three types of lamins, A,
B (see LMNB1; 150340), and C, have been described in mammalian cells
(Fisher et al., 1986).

CLONING

By screening human fibroblast and hepatoma cDNA libraries, Fisher et al.
(1986) isolated cDNAs corresponding to lamin A and lamin C. The lamin A
and C proteins are predicted to have molecular masses of 74 kD and 65
kD, respectively. Fisher et al. (1986) and McKeon et al. (1986) found
that the deduced amino acid sequences from cDNA clones of human lamin A
and C are identical for the first 566 amino acids, but that lamin A
contains an extra 98 amino acids (corresponding to approximately 9 kD)
at the C terminus. Lamin C has 6 unique C-terminal amino acids. Both
lamins A and C contain a 360-residue alpha-helical domain with homology
to a corresponding alpha-helical rod domain that is the structural
hallmark of all intermediate filament proteins. Fisher et al. (1986) and
McKeon et al. (1986) concluded that lamin A and lamin C arise by
alternative splicing from the same gene.

Guilly et al. (1987) detected a 3-kb lamin A mRNA and a 2.1-kb lamin C
mRNA in epithelial HeLa cells, but not in T lymphoblasts. Lamin B was
the only lamin present in T lymphoblasts. Guilly et al. (1987) noted
that the transport of newly synthesized proteins from the cytoplasm into
the nucleus differs from the transport of proteins into other
organelles, such as mitochondria, in that sequences are not cleaved and
remain a permanent feature of the mature polypeptide. Lamin A appears to
be an exception to this rule.

Weber et al. (1989) showed that lamin A is synthesized as a precursor
molecule called prelamin A. Maturation of lamin A involves the removal
of 18 residues from the C terminus, which is accomplished by
isoprenylation and farnesylation involving a C-terminal CAAX
(cysteine-aliphatic-aliphatic-any amino acid) box (Sinensky et al.,
1994).

GENE STRUCTURE

Lin and Worman (1993) demonstrated that the coding region of the lamin
A/C gene spans approximately 24 kb and contains 12 exons. Alternative
splicing within exon 10 gives rise to 2 different mRNAs that code for
prelamin A and lamin C.

MAPPING

Wydner et al. (1996) mapped the LMNA gene to chromosome 1q21.2-q21.3 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Gross (2013) mapped the LMNA gene to chromosome 1q22 based on an
alignment of the LMNA sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY847595) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Lloyd et al. (2002) identified proteins interacting with the C-terminal
domain of lamin A by screening a mouse 3T3-L1 adipocyte library in a
yeast 2-hybrid interaction screen. Using this approach, the adipocyte
differentiation factor SREBP1 (184756) was identified as a novel lamin A
interactor. In vitro glutathione S-transferase pull-down and in vivo
coimmunoprecipitation studies confirmed an interaction between lamin A
and both SREBP1a and 1c. A binding site for lamin A was identified in
the N-terminal transcription factor domain of SREBP1, between residues
227 and 487. The binding of lamin A to SREBP1 was noticeably reduced by
FPLD mutations. The authors speculated that fat loss seen in
laminopathies may be caused in part by reduced binding of the adipocyte
differentiation factor SREBP1 to lamin A.

Favreau et al. (2004) analyzed myoblast-to-myotube differentiation in a
mouse myogenic cell line overexpressing wildtype or mutant human lamin
A. In contrast to clones overexpressing wildtype lamin A, those
expressing lamin A with the R453W mutation (150330.0002) differentiated
poorly or not at all, did not exit the cell cycle properly, and were
extensively committed to apoptosis. Clones expressing the R482W mutation
(150330.0011) differentiated normally. Favreau et al. (2004) concluded
that lamin A mutated at arginine-453 fails to build a functional
scaffold and/or fails to maintain the chromatin compartmentation
required for differentiation of myoblasts into myocytes.

Using a novel technique to measure nuclear deformation in response to
biaxial strain applied to cells, Lammerding et al. (2004) found that
Lmna -/- cells showed increased nuclear deformation, defective
mechanotransduction, and impaired viability under mechanical strain
compared to wildtype cells. In addition, activity of nuclear
factor-kappa-B (NFKB; 164011), a mechanical stress-responsive
transcription factor that can act as an antiapoptotic signal, was
impaired in the Lmna -/- cells. The findings suggested that lamin A/C
deficiency is associated with both defective nuclear mechanics and
impaired transcriptional activation.

Broers et al. (2004) used a cell compression device to compare wildtype
and Lmna-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and found that Lmna-null
cells showed significantly decreased mechanical stiffness and
significantly lower bursting force. Partial rescue of the phenotype by
transfection with either lamin A or lamin C prevented gross nuclear
disruption, but was unable to fully restore mechanical stiffness.
Confocal microscopy revealed that the nuclei of Lmna-null cells
exhibited an isotropic deformation upon indentation, despite an
anisotropic deformation of the cell as a whole. This nuclear behavior
suggested a loss of interaction of the disturbed nucleus with the
surrounding cytoskeleton. Actin-(102610), vimentin-(193060), and
tubulin-(191110) based filaments showed disturbed interaction in
Lmna-null cells. Broers et al. (2004) suggested that in addition to the
loss of nuclear stiffness, the loss of a physical interaction between
nuclear structures (i.e., lamins) and the cytoskeleton may cause more
general cellular weakness; they proposed a potential key function for
lamins in maintaining cellular tensegrity.

Van Berlo et al. (2005) showed that A-type lamins were essential for the
inhibition of fibroblast proliferation by TGF-beta-1 (190180).
TGF-beta-1 dephosphorylated RB1 (614041) through protein phosphatase 2A
(PPP2CA; 176915), both of which were associated with lamin A/C. In
addition, lamin A/C modulated the effect of TGF-beta-1 on collagen
production, a marker of mesenchymal differentiation. Van Berlo et al.
(2005) proposed a role for lamin A/C in control of gene activity
downstream of TGF-beta-1, via nuclear phosphatases such as PPP2CA.

Capanni et al. (2005) showed that the lamin A precursor was specifically
accumulated in lipodystrophy cells. Pre-lamin A was located at the
nuclear envelope and colocalized with SREBP1 Binding of SREBP1 to the
lamin A precursor was detected in patient fibroblasts, as well as in
control fibroblasts, forced to accumulate pre-lamin A by farnesylation
inhibitors. In contrast, SREBP1 did not interact in vivo with mature
lamin A or C in cultured fibroblasts. Inhibition of lamin A precursor
processing in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes resulted in sequestration of SREBP1
at the nuclear rim, thus decreasing the pool of active SREBP1 that
normally activates PPAR-gamma (601487) and causing impairment of
preadipocyte differentiation. This defect could be rescued by treatment
with troglitazone, a known PPAR-gamma ligand activating the adipogenic
program.

Scaffidi and Misteli (2006) showed that the same molecular mechanism
responsible for Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS; 176670) is
active in healthy cells. Cell nuclei from old individuals acquire
defects similar to those of HGPS patient cells, including changes in
histone modifications and increased DNA damage. Age-related nuclear
defects are caused by sporadic use, in healthy individuals, of the same
cryptic splice site in lamin A whose constitutive activation causes
HGPS. Inhibition of this splice site reverses the nuclear defects
associated with aging. Scaffidi and Misteli (2006) concluded that their
observations implicate lamin A in physiologic aging.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see 609423) protease inhibitors
(PIs) targeting the viral aspartyl protease are a cornerstone of
treatment for HIV infection and disease, but they are associated with
lipodystrophy and other side effects. Coffinier et al. (2007) found that
treatment of human and mouse fibroblasts with HIV-PIs caused an
accumulation of prelamin A. The prelamin A in HIV-PI-treated fibroblasts
migrated more rapidly than nonfarnesylated prelamin A, comigrating with
the farnesylated form found in ZMPSTE24 (606480)-deficient fibroblasts.
HIV-PI-treated heterozygous ZMPSTE24 fibroblasts exhibited an
exaggerated accumulation of farnesyl-prelamin A. Western blot and
enzymatic analysis showed that HIV-PIs inhibited ZMPSTE24 activity and
endoproteolytic processing of a GFP-prelamin A fusion protein, but they
did not affect farnesylation of HDJ2 (DNAJA1; 602837) or activity of
farnesyltransferase (see 134635), ICMT (605851), and RCE1 (605385) in
vitro. Coffinier et al. (2007) concluded that HIV-PIs inhibit ZMPSTE24,
leading to an accumulation of farnesyl-prelamin A, possibly explaining
HIV-PI side effects.

The nuclear envelope LINC (links the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton)
complex, which is formed by SUN (e.g., SUN1, 607723) and nesprin (e.g.,
SYNE1, 608441) proteins, provides a direct connection between the
nuclear lamina and the cytoskeleton. Haque et al. (2010) stated that
SUN1 and SUN2 interact with LMNA and that LMNA is required for the
nuclear envelope localization of SUN2, but not SUN1. They found that
LMNA mutations associated with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD2;
181350) and HGPS disrupted interaction of LMNA with mouse Sun1 and human
SUN2. Nuclear localization of SUN1 and SUN2 was not impaired in EDMD2 or
HGPS cell lines. Expression of SUN1, but not SUN2, at the nuclear
envelope was enhanced in some HGPS cells, likely due to increased
interaction of SUN1 with accumulated prelamin A. Haque et al. (2010)
proposed that different perturbations in LMNA-SUN protein interactions
may underlie the opposing effects of EDMD and HGPS mutations on nuclear
and cellular mechanics.

Liu et al. (2011) reported the generation of induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs) from fibroblasts obtained from patients with HGPS. HGPS
iPSCs showed absence of progerin, and more importantly, lacked the
nuclear envelope and epigenetic alterations normally associated with
premature aging. Upon differentiation of HGPS iPSCs, progerin and its
aging-associated phenotypic consequences were restored. Specifically,
directed differentiation of HGPS iPSCs to vascular smooth muscle cells
led to the appearance of premature senescence phenotypes associated with
vascular aging. Additionally, their studies identified DNA-dependent
protein kinase catalytic subunit (PRKDC; 600899) as a downstream target
of progerin. The absence of nuclear PRKDC holoenzyme correlated with
premature as well as physiologic aging. Because progerin also
accumulates during physiologic aging, Liu et al. (2011) argued that
their results provided an in vitro iPSC-based model to study the
pathogenesis of human premature and physiologic vascular aging.

Chen et al. (2012) showed that cells from Lmna -/- mice, which represent
EDMD2, cells from Lmna(L530P/L530P) mice, which represent HGPS, and
cells from HGPS patients all had overaccumulation of the inner nuclear
envelope SUN1 protein. In wildtype cells, Lmna and Sun1 colocalized at
the nuclear envelope. In Lmna -/- cells, larger amounts of Sun1 were
found at the nuclear envelope and also in the Golgi. The larger amounts
of Sun1 appeared to result from reduced protein turnover. Transfection
of increasing amounts of mouse Sun1 into Lmna-null/Sun1-null murine
cells resulted in increased prevalence of nuclear herniations and
apoptosis, and the herniations appeared to result from Sun1 accumulation
in the Golgi. Loss of the Sun1 gene in both mouse models extensively
rescued cellular, tissue, organ, and lifespan abnormalities. Similarly,
knockdown of overaccumulated SUN1 protein in primary human HGPS cells
corrected nuclear defects and cellular senescence. The findings
indicated that accumulation of SUN1 is a common pathogenetic event in
these disorders.

In mice, Ho et al. (2013) found that lamin A/C-deficient (Lmna-null) and
Lmna(N195K/N195K) (see 150330.0007) mutant cells have impaired nuclear
translocation and downstream signaling of the mechanosensitive
transcription factor megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (MKL1; 606078), a
myocardin family member that is pivotal in cardiac development and
function. Altered nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of MKL1 was caused by
altered actin dynamics in Lmna-null and Lmna(N195K/N195K) mutant cells.
Ectopic expression of the nuclear envelope protein emerin (300384),
which is mislocalized in Lmna mutant cells and also linked to
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (310300) and dilated cardiomyopathy,
restored MKL1 nuclear translocation and rescued actin dynamics in mutant
cells. Ho et al. (2013) concluded that their findings presented a novel
mechanism that could provide insight into the disease etiology for the
cardiac phenotype in many laminopathies, whereby lamin A/C and emerin
regulate gene expression through modulation of nuclear and cytoskeletal
actin polymerization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mutations in the LMNA gene cause a wide range of human diseases. Since
more than 10 different clinical syndromes have been attributed to LMNA
mutations, many of which show overlapping features, attempts at broad
classification have been proposed. Worman and Bonne (2007) suggested
that the disorders may be classified into 4 major types: diseases of
striated and cardiac muscle; lipodystrophy syndromes; peripheral
neuropathy; and premature aging. Benedetti et al. (2007) suggested 2
main groups: (1) neuromuscular and cardiac disorders, and (2)
lipodystrophy and premature aging disorders. The phenotypic
heterogeneity of diseases resulting from a mutation in a single gene can
be explained by the numerous roles of the nuclear lamina, including
maintenance of nuclear shape and structure, as well as functional roles
in transcriptional regulation and heterochromatin organization (review
by Capell and Collins, 2006).

Genschel and Schmidt (2000) compiled a list of 41 known mutations,
predominantly missense, in the LMNA gene. Twenty-three different
mutations had been shown to cause autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss
muscular dystrophy (EDMD2; 181350). Three mutations had been reported to
cause autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD1B;
159001), 8 mutations were known to result in dilated cardiomyopathy
(CMD1A; 115200), and 7 mutations were reported to cause familial partial
lipodystrophy (FPLD2; 151660). In addition, 1 mutation in LMNA (H222Y;
150330.0014) appeared to be responsible for an autosomal recessive,
atypical form of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD3; see 181350).

- Muscular Dystrophies

In 5 families with autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
(EDMD2; 181350), Bonne et al. (1999) identified 4 mutations in the LMNA
gene (150330.0001-150330.0004) that cosegregated with the disease
phenotype. These findings represented the first identification of
mutations in a component of the nuclear lamina as a cause of an
inherited muscle disorder. The authors noted that lamins interact with
integral proteins of the inner nuclear membrane, including emerin
(300384), which is mutated in the X-linked form of Emery-Dreifuss
muscular dystrophy (EDMD1; 310300).

Raffaele di Barletta et al. (2000) showed that heterozygous mutations in
LMNA may cause diverse phenotypes ranging from typical EDMD to no
phenotypic effect. LMNA mutations in patients with autosomal dominant
EDMD occur in the tail and in the 2A rod domain of the protein,
suggesting that unique interactions between lamin A/C and other nuclear
components have an important role in cardiac and skeletal muscle
function. They identified a homozygous LMNA mutation (H222Y;
150330.0014) in 1 patient born of consanguineous unaffected parents,
consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance and a severe atypical
phenotype lacking cardiac features.

Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (LGMD1B; 159001) is an autosomal
dominant, slowly progressive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy with
age-related atrioventricular cardiac conduction disturbances and the
absence of early contractures. Muchir et al. (2000) found mutations in
the LMNA gene in 3 LGMD1B families: a missense mutation (150330.0017), a
deletion of a codon (150330.0018), and a splice donor site mutation
(150330.0019). The 3 mutations were identified in all affected members
of the corresponding families and were absent in 100 unrelated control
subjects.

Quijano-Roy et al. (2008) described a form of congenital muscular
dystrophy (MDC) with onset in the first year of life in 15 children
resulting from de novo heterozygous mutations in the LMNA gene (see,
e.g., 150330.0047-150330.0049). Three patients had severe early-onset
disease, with decreased fetal movements in utero, no motor development,
severe hypotonia, diffuse limb and axial muscle weakness and atrophy,
and talipes foot deformities. The remaining 12 children initially
acquired head and trunk control and independent ambulation, but most
lost head control due to neck extensor weakness, a phenotype consistent
with 'dropped head syndrome.' Ten children required ventilatory support.
Cardiac arrhythmias were observed in 4 of the oldest patients, but were
symptomatic only in 1. Quijano-Roy et al. (2008) concluded that the
identified LMNA mutations appeared to correlate with a relatively severe
phenotype, broadening the spectrum of laminopathies. The authors
suggested that this group of patients may define a new disease entity,
which they designated LMNA-related congenital muscular dystrophy
(613205).

Benedetti et al. (2007) reported 27 individuals with mutations in the
LMNA gene resulting in a wide range of neuromuscular disorders.
Phenotypic analysis yielded 2 broad groups of patients. One group
included patients with childhood onset who had skeletal muscle
involvement with predominant scapuloperoneal and facial weakness,
consistent with EDMD or congenital muscular dystrophy. The second group
included patients with later or adult onset who had cardiac disorders or
a limb-girdle myopathy, consistent with LGMD1B. Those in the group with
early onset tended to have missense mutations, whereas those in the
group with adult onset tended to have truncating mutations. Analysis of
the variants showed that those associated with early-onset phenotypes
were primarily found in the Ig-like domain and in coil 2A, which may
interfere with binding to specific ligands. Those associated with later
onset were mostly located in the rod domain and in coil 2B, which was
predicted to affect the surface of lamin A/C dimers and lead to impaired
filament assembly. Benedetti et al. (2007) speculated that there may be
2 different pathogenetic mechanisms associated with neuromuscular
LMNA-related disorders: late-onset phenotypes may arise through loss of
LMNA function secondary to haploinsufficiency, whereas dominant-negative
or toxic gain-of-function mechanisms may underlie the more severe early
phenotypes.

- Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Cardiac Conduction Defects

Fatkin et al. (1999) studied the LMNA gene in 11 families with autosomal
dominant dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction system disease (CMD1A;
115200) linked to a region on chromosome 1 overlapping that of the LMNA
gene. They identified 5 novel missense mutations
(150330.0004-150330.0009): 4 in the alpha-helical rod domain of lamin A,
and 1 in the tail domain of lamin C. No family members with mutations
had joint contractures or skeletal myopathy characteristic of autosomal
dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Furthermore, serum creatine
kinase levels were normal in family members with mutations of the lamin
A rod domain, but mildly elevated in some family members with a defect
in the lamin C tail domain. The authors noted that mutations in the rod
domain of the protein led to dilated cardiomyopathy, whereas mutations
in the head or tail domain caused Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.

Van der Kooi et al. (2002) reported a sporadic patient and 2 unrelated
families with mutations in the LMNA gene who presented with varying
degrees and combinations of muscular dystrophy, partial lipodystrophy,
and cardiomyopathy with conduction defects, presumably due to single
mutations (see 150330.0003 and 150330.0005).

Sebillon et al. (2003) screened the coding sequence of LMNA in DNA
samples from 66 index cases of dilated cardiomyopathy with or without
associated features. They identified a glu161-to-lys mutation (E161K;
150330.0028) in a family with early-onset atrial fibrillation preceding
or coexisting with dilated cardiomyopathy, the previously described
R377H mutation (150330.0017) in the family with quadriceps myopathy
associated with dilated cardiomyopathy previously reported by Charniot
et al. (2003), and a 28insA mutation (150330.0029) leading to a
premature stop codon in a third family with dilated cardiomyopathy with
conduction defects. No mutation in LMNA was found in cases with isolated
dilated cardiomyopathy.

Meune et al. (2006) investigated the efficacy of implantable
cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in the primary prevention of sudden
death in patients with cardiomyopathy due to lamin A/C gene mutations.
Patients referred for permanent cardiac pacing were systematically
offered the implantation of an ICD. The patients were enrolled solely on
the basis of the presence of lamin A/C mutations associated with cardiac
conduction defects. Indications for pacemaker implantation were
progressive conduction block and sinus block. In all, 19 patients were
treated. Meune et al. (2006) concluded that ICD implantation in patients
with lamin A/C mutations who are in need of a pacemaker is effective in
treating possibly lethal tachyarrhythmias, and that implantation of an
ICD, rather than a pacemaker, should be considered for such patients.

Taylor et al. (2003) screened the LMNA gene in 40 families and 9
sporadic patients with CMD with or without muscular dystrophy and
identified mutations in 3 families (see, e.g., 150330.0017) and 1
sporadic patient (S573L; 150330.0041). All mutations involved a
conserved residue, cosegregated with the disease within the families,
and were not found in 300 control chromosomes. LMNA mutation carriers
had a severe and progressive form of CMD with significantly poorer
cumulative survival compared to noncarrier CMD patients.

- Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Hypergonadotropic Hypogonadism

In a 17-year-old Caucasian female with premature ovarian failure and
dilated cardiomyopathy, who had features consistent with atypical Werner
syndrome (see 277700) but who was negative for mutation in the RECQL2
gene (604611), Nguyen et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a
missense mutation in the LMNA gene (L59R; 150330.0052). The authors
suggested the diagnosis of a laminopathy, most likely an atypical form
of mandibuloacral dysplasia (see 248370).

In a 15-year-old Caucasian girl with premature ovarian failure and
dilated cardiomyopathy, McPherson et al. (2009) identified
heterozygosity for the L59R mutation in the LMNA gene. McPherson et al.
(2009) noted phenotypic similarities between this patient and the
patient previously reported by Nguyen et al. (2007), who carried the
same mutation, as well as a patient originally described by Chen et al.
(2003) with an adjacent A57P mutation in LMNA (150330.0030). Features
common to these 3 patients included premature ovarian failure, dilated
cardiomyopathy, lipodystrophy, and progressive facial and skeletal
changes involving micrognathia and sloping shoulders, but not
acroosteolysis. Although the appearance of these patients was somewhat
progeroid, none had severe growth failure, alopecia, or rapidly
progressive atherosclerosis, and McPherson et al. (2009) suggested that
the phenotype represents a distinct laminopathy involving dilated
cardiomyopathy and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (212112).

- Lipodystrophy Disorders

Patients with Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy, or partial
lipodystrophy type 2 (FPLD2; 151660), are born with normal fat
distribution, but after puberty experience regional and progressive
adipocyte degeneration, often associated with profound insulin
resistance and diabetes. Cao and Hegele (2000) hypothesized that the
analogy between the regional muscle wasting in autosomal dominant
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and the regional adipocyte
degeneration in FPLD, in addition to the chromosomal localization of the
FPLD2 locus on 1q21-q22, made LMNA a good candidate gene for FPLD2.
Studies of 5 Canadian probands with familial partial lipodystrophy of
Dunnigan type indicated that each had a novel missense mutation (R482Q;
150330.0010) that cosegregated with the lipodystrophy phenotype and was
absent from 2,000 normal alleles.

Shackleton et al. (2000) identified 5 different missense mutations in
the LMNA gene (see, e.g., 150330.0010-150330.0012) among 10 kindreds and
3 individuals with partial lipodystrophy. All of the mutations occurred
in exon 8, which the authors noted is within the C-terminal globular
domain of lamin A/C. Flier (2000) commented on the significance of LMNA
mutations in partial lipodystrophy.

Vantyghem et al. (2004) characterized the neuromuscular and cardiac
phenotypes of FPLD patients bearing the heterozygous R482W mutation.
Fourteen patients from 2 unrelated families, including 10 affected
subjects, were studied. Clinical and histologic examination showed an
incapacitating, progressive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy in a
42-year-old woman that had been present since childhood, associated with
a typical postpubertal FPLD phenotype. Six of 8 adults presented the
association of calf hypertrophy, perihumeral muscular atrophy, and a
rolling gait due to proximal lower limb weakness. Muscular histology was
compatible with muscular dystrophy in one of them and/or showed a
nonspecific excess of lipid droplets (in 3 cases). Cardiac septal
hypertrophy and atherosclerosis were frequent in FPLD patients. In
addition, a 24-year-old FPLD patient had a symptomatic second-degree
atrioventricular block. Vantyghem et al. (2004) concluded that most
lipodystrophic patients affected by the FPLD-linked R482W mutation show
muscular and cardiac abnormalities.

Mandibuloacral dysplasia (see 248370) is a rare autosomal recessive
disorder characterized by postnatal growth retardation, craniofacial
anomalies, skeletal malformations, and mottled cutaneous pigmentation.
Patients with MAD frequently have partial lipodystrophy and insulin
resistance, which are features seen in FPLD. In all affected members of
5 consanguineous Italian families with MAD, Novelli et al. (2002)
identified a homozygous missense mutation (R527H; 150330.0021) in the
LMNA gene. Patient skin fibroblasts showed nuclei that presented
abnormal lamin A/C distribution and a dysmorphic envelope, demonstrating
the pathogenic effect of the mutation.

In affected members of a consanguineous family from north India,
Plasilova et al. (2004) identified a homozygous missense mutation in the
LMNA gene (150330.0033). The extent of skeletal lesions in this family
were consistent with MAD, but affected individuals also had classic
features of progeria. Plasilova et al. (2004) suggested that autosomal
recessive HGPS and mandibuloacral dysplasia may represent a single
disorder with varying degrees of disease severity.

Decaudain et al. (2007) identified changes in codon 482 of the LMNA gene
(see, e.g., R482Q 150330.0010 and R482W; 150330.0011) in 17 of 277
unrelated adults investigated for lipodystrophy and/or insulin
resistance. All 17 had classic features of FPLD2. Ten additional
patients who fulfilled the International Diabetes Federation diagnostic
criteria for metabolic syndrome were found to have heterozygous LMNA
mutations that were not in codon 482, but affected all 3 domains of the
protein, the N terminal, central rod domain, and C terminal globulin
domain (see, e.g., R399C; 150330.0043). Because the phenotype of these
patients was not typical of FPLD2, the diagnosis of laminopathy was
delayed. Although lipodystrophy was less severe than in typical FPLD2,
common features included calf hypertrophy, myalgia, and muscle cramps or
weakness. Two patients had cardiac conduction disturbances. Metabolic
alterations were prominent, especially insulin resistance and
hypertriglyceridemia.

- Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2B1

In affected members of inbred Algerian families with an axonal form of
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease linked to chromosome 1q21.2-q21.3 (CMT2B1;
605588), De Sandre-Giovannoli et al. (2002) found a shared common
homozygous ancestral haplotype that was suggestive of a founder mutation
and identified a unique mutation in the LMNA rod domain (R298C;
150330.0020). Ultrastructural studies of sciatic nerves of Lmna-null
mice showed a strong reduction of axon density, axonal enlargement, and
the presence of nonmyelinated axons, all of which were highly similar to
the phenotypes of human peripheral axonopathies.

- Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome and Other Premature
Aging Syndromes

Eriksson et al. (2003) identified de novo heterozygous point mutations
in lamin A that cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS;
176670). Eighteen of 20 classic cases of HGPS harbored the identical de
novo single-base substitution resulting in a silent gly-to-gly change at
codon 608 within exon 11 (150330.0022). This change creates an exonic
consensus splice site and activates cryptic splicing, leading to
deletion of 50 codons at the end of prelamin A. This prelamin A still
retains the CAAX box but lacks the site for endoproteolytic cleavage.
Eriksson et al. (2003) suggested that there is at least 1 site for
phosphorylation, ser625, that is deleted in the abnormal lamin A
protein. De Sandre-Giovannoli et al. (2003) independently identified the
heterozygous exon 11 cryptic splice site activation mutation
(1824C-T+1819-1968del; 150330.0022) in 2 HGPS patients. Later cellular
studies (Capell et al., 2005; Glynn and Glover, 2005; Toth et al., 2005)
indicated that Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome results from the
production of a truncated prelamin A, called progerin, which is
farnesylated at its C terminus and accumulates at the nuclear envelope,
causing misshapen nuclei (Yang et al., 2006).

Werner syndrome (277700) is an autosomal recessive progeroid syndrome
caused by mutation in the RECQL2 gene (WRN; 604611). Chen et al. (2003)
reported that of 129 index patients referred to their international
registry for molecular diagnosis of Werner syndrome, 26 (20%) had
wildtype RECQL2 coding regions and were categorized as having 'atypical
Werner syndrome' or 'non-WRN' on the basis of molecular criteria.
Because of some phenotypic similarities between Werner syndrome and
laminopathies including Hutchinson-Gilford progeria, Chen et al. (2003)
sequenced all exons of the LMNA gene in these 26 individuals and found
heterozygosity for novel missense mutations in LMNA in 4 (15%): A57P
(150330.0030), R133L (150330.0027) in 2 persons, and L140R
(150330.0031). Hegele (2003) stated that the clinical designation of
Werner syndrome for each of the 4 patients of Chen et al. (2003), in
whom mutations in the LMNA gene were found, appeared somewhat insecure.
He noted that the comparatively young ages of onset in the patients with
mutant LMNA would be just as consistent with late-onset
Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome as with early-onset Werner syndrome.
Patients with so-called atypical Werner syndrome and mutant LMNA also
expressed components of nonprogeroid laminopathies. Hegele (2003)
suggested that genomic DNA analysis can help draw a diagnostic line that
clarifies potential overlap between older patients with
Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome and younger patients with Werner syndrome,
and that therapies may depend on precise molecular classification.

McPherson et al. (2009) suggested that the patient in whom Chen et al.
(2003) identified an A57P LMNA mutation had a distinct phenotype
involving dilated cardiomyopathy and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism
(212112).

Csoka et al. (2004) screened 13 cell lines from atypical progeroid
patients for mutation in the LMNA gene. They identified 3 novel
heterozygous missense mutations in the LMNA gene in 3 patients: a
13-year-old female with a progeroid syndrome, a 15-year-old male with a
lipodystrophy, and a 20-year-old male with 'atypical progeria.' The
mutations identified in the last 2 patients were the most 5-prime and
3-prime missense mutations, respectively, in LMNA identified to that
time.

Reddel and Weiss (2004) reported that transcription efficiencies of the
mutant and wildtype LMNA alleles were equivalent in HGPS. The mutant
allele gave 2 types of transcripts that encoded truncated and normal
lamin A. Abnormally spliced progerin transcript constituted the majority
(84.5%) of the total steady-state mRNA derived from the mutant allele.
The abnormally spliced progerin transcript was a minority (40%) of all
lamin A transcripts obtained from both alleles. Reddel and Weiss (2004)
concluded that the mutated progerin functions as a dominant negative by
interfering with the structure of the nuclear lamina, intranuclear
architecture, and macromolecular interactions, which collectively would
have a major impact on nuclear function.

Fibroblasts from individuals with HGPS have severe morphologic
abnormalities in nuclear envelope structure. Scaffidi and Misteli (2005)
showed that the cellular disease phenotype is reversible in cells from
individuals with HGPS. Introduction of wildtype lamin A protein did not
rescue the cellular disease manifestations. The mutant LMNA mRNA and
lamin A protein could be efficiently eliminated by correction of the
aberrant splicing event using a modified oligonucleotide targeted to the
activated cryptic splice site. Upon splicing correction, HGPS
fibroblasts assumed normal nuclear morphology, the aberrant nuclear
distribution and cellular levels of lamina-associated proteins were
rescued, defects in heterochromatin-specific histone modifications were
corrected, and proper expression of several misregulated genes was
reestablished. The results established proof of principle for the
correction of the premature aging phenotype in individuals with HGPS.

Huang et al. (2005) designed short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) targeting
mutated pre-spliced or mature LMNA mRNAs and expressed them in HGPS
fibroblasts carrying the 1824C-T mutation (150330.0022). One of the
shRNAs reduced the expression levels of mutant lamin A (so-called LA
delta-50) to 26% or lower. The reduced expression was associated with
amelioration of abnormal nuclear morphology, improvement of
proliferative potential, and reduction in the numbers of senescent
cells.

Moulson et al. (2007) reported 2 unrelated patients with extremely
severe forms of HGPS associated with unusual mutations in the LMNA gene
(150330.0036 and 150330.0040, respectively). Both mutations resulted in
increased use of the cryptic exon 11 donor splice site that is also
observed with the common 1824C-T mutation (150330.0022). As a
consequence, the ratios of mutant progerin mRNA and protein to wildtype
were higher than in typical HGPS patients. The findings indicated that
the level of progerin expression correlates with severity of disease.

Scaffidi and Misteli (2008) found that progerin (150330.0022) expression
in immortalized human skin fibroblasts produced several defects typical
of HGPS. Progerin also caused the spontaneous differentiation of human
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into endothelial cells, and reduced their
differentiation along the adipogenic lineage. Abnormal differentiation
of MSCs appeared to be due to progerin-induced activation of major
downstream effectors of the Notch signaling pathway, including HES1
(139605), HES5 (607348), and HEY1 (602953). Scaffidi and Misteli (2008)
noted that the progerin splice variant of LMNA is present at low levels
in cells from healthy individuals and has been implicated in the normal
aging process. They suggested that progerin-induced defects in Notch
signaling are involved in normal aging and similarly affect adult MSCs
and their differentiation.

- Restrictive Dermopathy

In 2 of 9 fetuses with restrictive dermopathy (275210), a lethal
genodermatosis in which tautness of the skin causes fetal akinesia or
hypokinesia deformation sequence, Navarro et al. (2004) identified
heterozygous splicing mutations in the LMNA gene, resulting in the
complete or partial loss of exon 11 (150330.0036 and 150330.0022,
respectively). In the other 7 patients, they identified a heterozygous
1-bp insertion resulting in a premature stop codon in the zinc
metalloproteinase STE24 gene (ZMPSTE24; 606480). This gene encodes a
metalloproteinase specifically involved in the posttranslational
processing of lamin A precursor. In all patients carrying a ZMPSTE24
mutation, loss of expression of lamin A as well as abnormal patterns of
nuclear sizes and shapes and mislocalization of lamin-associated
proteins was seen. Navarro et al. (2004) concluded that a common
pathogenetic pathway, involving defects of the nuclear lamina and
matrix, is involved in restrictive dermopathy.

Navarro et al. (2005) described 7 previously reported patients and 3 new
patients with restrictive dermopathy who were homozygous or compound
heterozygous for ZMPSTE24 mutations. In all cases there was complete
absence of both ZMPSTE24 and mature lamin A, associated with prelamin A
accumulation. The authors concluded that restrictive dermopathy is
either a primary or a secondary laminopathy, caused by dominant de novo
LMNA mutations or, more frequently, recessive null ZMPSTE24 mutations.
The accumulation of truncated or normal length prelamin A is, therefore,
a shared pathophysiologic feature in recessive and dominant restrictive
dermopathy.

- Heart-Hand Syndrome, Slovenian Type

In a Slovenian family with heart-hand syndrome (610140), originally
reported by Sinkovec et al. (2005), Renou et al. (2008) identified a
splice site mutation in the LMNA gene (150330.0045) that segregated with
disease and was not found in 100 healthy controls. Analysis of
fibroblasts from 2 affected members of the family revealed truncated
lamin A/C protein and nuclear envelope abnormalities, confirming the
pathogenicity of the mutation.

- Other Associations

Hegele et al. (2000) identified a common single-nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) in LMNA, 1908C/T, which was associated with obesity-related traits
in Canadian Oji-Cree. Hegele et al. (2001) reported association of this
LMNA SNP with anthropometric indices in 186 nondiabetic Canadian Inuit.
They found that physical indices of obesity, such as body mass index,
waist circumference, waist-to-hip circumference ratio, subscapular
skinfold thickness, and subscapular-to-triceps skinfold thickness ratio
were each significantly higher among Inuit subjects with the LMNA 1908T
allele than in subjects with the 1908C/1908C genotype. For each
significantly associated obesity-related trait, the LMNA 1908C/T SNP
genotype accounted for approximately 10 to 100% of the attributable
variation. The results indicated that common genetic variation in LMNA
is an important determinant of obesity-related quantitative traits.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

In 14 of 15 families with familial partial lipodystrophy, Speckman et
al. (2000) identified mutations in exon 8 of the LMNA gene: 5 families
had an R482Q mutation (150330.0010); 7 families had an R482W alteration
(150330.0011), and 1 family had a G465D alteration (150330.0015). The
R482Q and R482W mutations occurred on different haplotypes, indicating
that they probably had arisen more than once. One family with an
atypical form of familial partial lipodystrophy had an R582H mutation
(150330.0016) in exon 11 of the LMNA gene, which the authors noted can
affect the lamin A protein only. Speckman et al. (2000) noted that all
mutations in Dunnigan lipodystrophy affect the globular C-terminal
domain of the lamin A/C protein, whereas mutations responsible for
dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction-system disease are usually
clustered in the rod domain of the protein (Fatkin et al., 1999).
Speckman et al. (2000) could not detect mutations in the LMNA gene in 1
FPLD family that showed linkage to 1q21-q23.

Hegele (2005) used hierarchical cluster analysis to assemble 16
laminopathy phenotypes into 2 classes based on organ system involvement,
and then classified 91 reported causative LMNA mutations according to
their position upstream or downstream of the nuclear localization signal
(NLS) sequence. Contingency analysis revealed that laminopathy class and
LMNA mutation position were strongly correlated (p less than 0.0001),
suggesting that laminopathy phenotype and LMNA genotype are nonrandomly
associated.

Lanktree et al. (2007) analyzed the LMNA gene in 3 unrelated patients
with FPLD2 and identified heterozygosity for 3 different missense
mutations, all affecting only the lamin A isoform and each changing a
conserved residue. Two of the mutations, D230N (150330.0042) and R399C
(150330.0043), were 5-prime to the NLS, which is not typical of LMNA
mutations in FPLD2. The third mutation, S573L (150330.0041), had
previously been identified in heterozygosity in a patient with dilated
cardiomyopathy and conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200) and in
homozygosity in a patient with arthropathy, tendinous calcinosis, and
progeroid features (see 248370). None of the mutations were found in 200
controls of multiple ethnicities. Because heterozygosity for an S573L
mutation can cause cardiomyopathy without lipodystrophy or lipodystrophy
without cardiomyopathy, Lanktree et al. (2007) suggested that additional
factors, genetic or environmental, may contribute to the precise tissue
involvement.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mounkes et al. (2003) attempted to create a mouse model for autosomal
dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (181350) by introducing a
L530P (150330.0004) mutation in the LMNA gene. Although mice
heterozygous for L530P did not show signs of muscular dystrophy and
remained overtly normal up to 6 months of age, mice homozygous for the
mutation showed phenotypes markedly reminiscent of symptoms observed in
progeria patients. Homozygous Lmna L530P/L530P mice were
indistinguishable from their littermates at birth, but by 4 to 6 days
developed severe growth retardation, dying within 4 to 5 weeks.
Homozygous mutant mice showed a slight waddling gait, suggesting
immobility of joints. Other progeria features of these mutant mice
included micrognathia and abnormal dentition--in approximately half of
the mutants a gap was observed between the lower 2 incisors, which also
appeared yellowed. Mutant mice also had loss of subcutaneous fat,
reduced numbers of eccrine and sebaceous glands, increased collagen
deposition in skin, and decreased hair follicle density. Mounkes et al.
(2003) concluded that Lmna L530P/L530P mice have significant phenotypic
overlap with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, including nuclear
envelope abnormalities and decreased doublet capacity and life span of
fibroblasts.

Mounkes et al. (2005) generated mice expressing the human N195K
(150330.0007) mutation and observed characteristics consistent with
CMD1A. Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring of cardiac activity
demonstrated that N195K-homozygous mice died at an early age due to
arrhythmia. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis showed that
Hf1b/Sp4 (600540), connexin-40 (GJA5; 121013), and connexin-43 (GJA1;
121014) were misexpressed and/or mislocalized in N195K-homozygous mouse
hearts. Desmin staining revealed a loss of organization at sarcomeres
and intercalated disks. Mounkes et al. (2005) hypothesized that
mutations within the LMNA gene may cause cardiomyopathy by disrupting
the internal organization of the cardiomyocyte and/or altering the
expression of transcription factors essential to normal cardiac
development, aging, or function.

Arimura et al. (2005) created a mouse model of autosomal dominant
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy expressing an H222P mutation in Lmna.
At adulthood, male homozygous mice displayed reduced locomotion activity
with abnormal stiff walking posture, and all died by 9 months of age.
They also developed dilated cardiomyopathy with hypokinesia and
conduction defects. These skeletal and cardiac muscle features were also
observed in the female homozygous mice, but with a later onset than in
males. Histopathologic analysis of the mice revealed muscle degeneration
with fibrosis associated with dislocation of heterochromatin and
activation of Smad signaling in heart and skeletal muscles.

Varga et al. (2006) created transgenic mice carrying the G608G
(150330.0022)-mutated human LMNA gene and observed the development of a
dramatic defect of the large arteries, consisting of progressive medial
vascular smooth muscle cell loss and replacement with proteoglycan and
collagen followed by vascular remodeling with calcification and
adventitial thickening. In vivo, these arterial abnormalities were
reflected by a blunted initial response to the vasodilator sodium
nitroprusside, consistent with impaired vascular relaxation, and
attenuated blood pressure recovery after infusion. Varga et al. (2006)
noted that although G608G transgenic mice lacked the external phenotype
seen in human progeria, they demonstrated a progressive vascular
abnormality that closely resembled the most lethal aspect of the human
phenotype.

Frock et al. (2006) found that most cultured muscle cells from Lmna
knockout mice exhibited impaired differentiation kinetics and reduced
differentiation potential. Similarly, knockdown of Lmna or emerin (EMD;
300384) expression by RNA interference in normal muscle cells impaired
differentiation potential and reduced expression of muscle-specific
genes, Myod (159970) and desmin (125660). To determine whether impaired
myogenesis was linked to reduced Myod or desmin levels, Frock et al.
(2006) individually expressed these proteins in Lmna-null myoblasts and
found that both increased the differentiation potential of mutant
myoblasts. Frock et al. (2006) concluded that LMNA and emerin are
required for myogenic differentiation, at least in part, through an
effect on expression of critical myoblast proteins.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is caused by the production
of a truncated prelamin A, called progerin, which is farnesylated at its
C terminus and accumulates at the nuclear envelope, causing misshapen
nuclei (Yang et al., 2006). Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) have
been shown to reverse this cellular abnormality (Yang et al., 2005; Toth
et al., 2005; Capell et al., 2005; Mallampalli et al., 2005). Yang et
al. (2006) generated mice with a targeted HGPS mutation (Lmna HG/+) and
observed phenotypes similar to those in human HGPS patients, including
retarded growth, reduced amounts of adipose tissue, micrognathia,
osteoporosis, and osteolytic lesions in bone, which caused spontaneous
rib fractures in the mutant mice. Treatment with an FTI increased
adipose tissue mass, improved body weight curves, reduced the number of
rib fractures, and improved bone mineralization and bone cortical
thickness.

Yang et al. (2008) created knockin mice expressing a nonfarnesylatable
form of progerin. Knockin mice developed the same disease phenotype as
mice expressing farnesylated progerin, although the phenotype was
milder, and embryonic fibroblasts derived from these mice contained
fewer misshapen nuclei. The steady-state level of nonfarnesylated
progerin, but not mRNA, was lower in cultured fibroblasts and whole
tissues, suggesting that the absence of farnesylation may accelerate
progerin turnover.

In a mouse model of EDMD carrying an H222P mutation in the Lmna gene
(Arimura et al., 2005), Muchir et al. (2007) found that activation of
MAPK (see 176948) pathways preceded clinical signs or detectable
molecular markers of cardiomyopathy. Expression of H222P-mutant Lmna in
heart tissue and isolated cardiomyocytes resulted in tissue-specific
activation of MAPKs and downstream target genes. The results suggested
that activation of MAPK pathways plays a role in the pathogenesis of
cardiac disease in EDMD.

Muchir et al. (2009) demonstrated abnormal activation of the
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) branch of the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade in hearts of
Lmna H222P knockin mice, a model of autosomal Emery-Dreifuss muscular
dystrophy. Systemic treatment of Lmna H222P/H222P mice that developed
cardiomyopathy with PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK activation, inhibited
ERK phosphorylation and blocked the activation of downstream genes in
heart. It also blocked increased expression of RNAs encoding natriuretic
peptide precursors and proteins involved in sarcomere organization that
occurred in placebo-treated mice. Histologic analysis and
echocardiography demonstrated that treatment with PD98059 delayed the
development of left ventricular dilatation. PD98059-treated Lmna
H222P/H222P mice had normal cardiac ejection fractions assessed by
echocardiography, whereas placebo-treated mice had a 30% decrease. The
authors emphasized the role of ERK activation in the development of
cardiomyopathy caused by LMNA mutations, and provided further proof of
principle for ERK inhibition as a therapeutic option to prevent or delay
heart failure in humans with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and
related disorders caused by mutations in LMNA.

Davies et al. (2010) created knockin mice harboring a mutant Lmna allele
that yielded exclusively nonfarnesylated prelamin A. These mice had no
evidence of progeria but succumbed to cardiomyopathy. Most of the
nonfarnesylated prelamin A in the tissues of these mice was localized at
the nuclear rim, indistinguishable from the lamin A in wildtype mice.
The cardiomyopathy could not be ascribed to an absence of lamin C
because mice expressing an otherwise identical knockin allele yielding
only wildtype prelamin A appeared normal. The authors concluded that
lamin C synthesis is dispensable in mice and that failure to convert
prelamin A to mature lamin A causes cardiomyopathy in the absence of
lamin C.

Choi et al. (2012) found that ERK activation in H222P/H222P mice
specifically upregulated expression of dual-specificity phosphatase-4
(DUSP4; 602747) in cardiac muscle, with much lower Dusp4 induction in
quadriceps muscle, and no Dusp4 induction in tongue, kidney, and liver.
Dusp4 overexpression in cultured C2C12 muscle cells or targeted to mouse
heart resulted in activation of the Akt (see AKT1; 164730)-Mtor (FRAP1;
601231) metabolic signaling pathway, leading to impaired autophagy and
abnormal cardiac metabolism, similar to findings in H222P/H222P mice.

In 2 families with autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
(181350), Bonne et al. (1999) found a G-to-C transversion in the LMNA
gene which, resulting in an arg527-to-pro (R527P) substitution. The
mutation, found in heterozygous state, was demonstrated to be de novo in
both families.

Van der Kooi et al. (2002) reported a woman with limb-girdle muscle
weakness, spinal rigidity, contractures, elevated creatine kinase,
cardiac conduction abnormalities (atrial fibrillation), partial
lipodystrophy (151660), and increased serum triglycerides who had the
R527P mutation. Van der Kooi et al. (2002) also reported a family with
the R527P mutation in which the proband, her father, and her son all
presented with varying degrees of EDMD, lipodystrophy, and cardiac
conduction abnormalities.

Makri et al. (2009) reported 2 sisters with early-onset autosomal
dominant muscular dystrophy most consistent with EDMD. Because the girls
were born of consanguineous Algerian parents, they were at first thought
to have an autosomal recessive congenital muscular dystrophy. However,
genetic analysis identified a heterozygous R527P mutation in the LMNA
gene in both patients that was not present in either unaffected parent.
The results were consistent with germline mosaicism or a recurrent de
novo event. The older sib had a difficult birth and showed congenital
hypotonia, diffuse weakness, and mild initial respiratory and feeding
difficulties. She sat unsupported at age 2 years and walked
independently from age 4 years with frequent falls and a waddling gait.
At 13 years she had a high-arched palate, moderate limb hypotonia, and
weakness of the pelvic muscles. There was proximal limb wasting,
moderate cervical, elbow, and ankle contractures, pes cavus, spinal
rigidity, and lordosis/scoliosis. Her sister had mild hypotonia in early
infancy, walked without support at 24 months, and showed proximal muscle
weakness. There were mild contractures of the elbow and ankles. At age 9
years, she showed adiposity of the neck, trunk and abdomen, consistent
with lipodystrophy. Brain MRI and cognition were normal in both sisters,
and neither had cardiac involvement. Muscle biopsies showed a dystrophic
pattern.

Van der Kooi et al. (2002) reported a woman with partial lipodystrophy
(151660), hypertriglyceridemia, and cardiomyopathy with conduction

585C-G transversion in the LMNA gene, resulting in an asn195-to-lys
(N195K) substitution.

Using cells from the mouse model of Mounkes et al. (2005), Ho et al.
(2013) found that Lmna N195K embryonic fibroblasts and bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells had impaired nuclear localization
of the mechanosensitive transcription factor MKL1 (606078). Cardiac
sections from Lmna(N195K/N195K) mice had significantly reduced fractions
of cardiomyocytes with nuclear Mkl1, implicating altered Mkl1 signaling
in the development of cardiomyopathy in these animals. Nuclear
accumulation of Mkl1 was substantially lower in Lmna N195K cells than in
wildtype cells. Altered nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Mkl1 was caused
by altered actin dynamics in Lmna(N195K/N195K) mutant cells. Ectopic
expression of the nuclear envelope protein emerin (300384) restored Mkl1
nuclear translocation and rescued actin dynamics in mutant cells.

In a family with autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy and

1711C-A transversion in the LMNA gene, resulting in an arg571-to-ser
(R571S) substitution. In this family, the C-terminal of lamin C was
selectively affected by the mutation, and the cardiac phenotype was
relatively milder than that associated with mutations in the rod domain
of the LMNA gene. Furthermore, there was subclinical evidence of
involvement of skeletal muscle. Although affected members of this family
had no skeletal muscle symptoms, some had elevated serum creatine kinase
levels, including 1 asymptomatic family member with the genotype
associated with the disease. The arg571-to-ser mutation affected only
lamin C isoforms, whereas previously described defects causing
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (181350) perturbed both lamin A and
lamin C isoforms.

LIPODYSTROPHY, FAMILIAL PARTIAL, TYPE 2
LMNA, ARG482GLN

In 5 probands from 5 Canadian kindreds with familial partial
lipodystrophy of the Dunnigan type (151660), Cao and Hegele (2000)
demonstrated heterozygosity for a G-to-A transition in exon 8 of the
LMNA gene, predicted to result in an arg484-to-gln (R482Q) substitution.
There were no differences in age, gender, or body mass index in
Q482/R482 heterozygotes compared with R482/R482 homozygotes (normals)
from these families; however, there were significantly more Q482/R482
heterozygotes who had definite partial lipodystrophy and frank diabetes.
Also compared with the normal homozygotes, heterozygotes had
significantly higher serum insulin and C-peptide (see 176730) levels.
The LMNA heterozygotes with diabetes were significantly older than
heterozygotes without diabetes.

Shackleton et al. (2000) found the R482Q mutation in a family with
familial partial lipodystrophy. Hegele et al. (2000) analyzed the
relationship between plasma leptin (164160) and the rare LMNA R482Q
mutation in 23 adult familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD) subjects
compared with 25 adult family controls with normal LMNA in an extended
Canadian FPLD kindred. They found that the LMNA Q482/R482 genotype was a
significant determinant of plasma leptin, the ratio of plasma leptin to
body mass index (BMI), plasma insulin, and plasma C peptide, but not
BMI. Family members who were Q482/R482 heterozygotes had significantly
lower plasma leptin and leptin:BMI ratio than unaffected R482/R482
homozygotes. Fasting plasma concentrations of insulin and C peptide were
both significantly higher in LMNA Q482/R482 heterozygotes than in
R482/R482 homozygotes. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that
the LMNA R482Q genotype accounted for 40.9%, 48.2%, 86.9%, and 81.0%,
respectively, of the attributable variation in log leptin, leptin:BMI
ratio, log insulin, and log C peptide. The authors concluded that a rare
FPLD mutation in LMNA determines the plasma leptin concentration.

Boguslavsky et al. (2006) found that overexpression of wildtype LMNA or
mutant R482Q or R482W (150330.0011) in mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes
prevented cellular lipid accumulation, inhibited triglyceride synthesis,
and prevented normal differentiation into adipocytes. In contrast,
embryonic fibroblasts from Lmna-null mice had increased levels of basal
triglyceride synthesis and differentiated into fat-containing cells more
readily that wildtype mouse cells. Mutations at residue 482 are not
predicted to affect the structure of the nuclear lamina, but may change
interactions with other proteins. The findings of this study suggested
that mutations responsible for FPLD are gain-of-function mutations.
Boguslavsky et al. (2006) postulated that mutations that result in gain
of function may cause higher binding affinity to a proadipogenic
transcription factor, thus preventing it from activating target genes;
overexpression of the wildtype protein may result in increased numbers
of molecules with a normal binding affinity. Overexpression of Lmna was
associated with decreased levels of PPARG2 (601487), a nuclear hormone
receptor transcription factor putatively involved in adipogenic
conversion. Lmna-null cells had increased basal phosphorylation of AKT1
(164730), a mediator of insulin signaling.

LMNA, ARG482TRP

In 6 families and 3 isolated cases of partial lipodystrophy (151660),
Shackleton et al. (2000) found heterozygosity for C-to-T transition in
the LMNA gene, resulting in an arg482-to-trp (R482W) substitution. This
is the same codon as that affected in the R482Q mutation (150330.0010).
R482L (150330.0012) is a third mutation in the same codon causing
partial lipodystrophy.

Schmidt et al. (2001) identified a family with partial lipodystrophy
carrying the R482W mutation in the LMNA gene. Clinically, the loss of
subcutaneous fat and muscular hypertrophy, especially of the lower
extremities, started as early as in childhood. Acanthosis and severe
hypertriglyceridemia developed later in life, followed by diabetes.
Characterization of the lipoprotein subfractions revealed that affected
children present with hyperlipidemia. The presence and severity of
hyperlipidemia seem to be influenced by age, apolipoprotein E genotype,
and the coexistence of diabetes mellitus. In conclusion, dyslipidemia is
an early and prominent feature in the presented lipodystrophic family
carrying the R482W mutation.

involvement, Brodsky et al. (2000) demonstrated heterozygosity in
affected members for a 1-bp deletion (del959T) deletion in exon 6 of the

Raffaele di Barletta et al. (2000) found a homozygous 664C-T transition
in the LMNA gene, resulting in a his222-to-tyr (H222Y) amino acid

In a family with an atypical form of familial partial lipodystrophy

mutation in exon 11 of the LMNA gene. In a follow-up of this same
family, Garg et al. (2001) reported that 2 affected sisters showed less
severe loss of subcutaneous fat from the trunk and extremities with some
retention of fat in the gluteal region and medial parts of the proximal
thighs compared to women with typical FPLD2. Noting that the R582H
mutation interrupts only the lamin A protein, Garg et al. (2001)
suggested that in typical FPLD2, interruption of both lamins A and C
causes a more severe phenotype than that seen in atypical FPLD2, in
which only lamin A is altered.

In a family with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (159001), Muchir
et al. (2000) found a G-to-A transition in exon 6 of the LMNA gene,
resulting in a substitution of histidine for arginine-377 (R377H).

Taylor et al. (2003) identified heterozygosity for the R377H mutation in
an American family of British descent with autosomal dominant dilated
cardiomyopathy and mild limb-girdle muscular disease.

Charniot et al. (2003) described a French family with autosomal dominant
severe dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects or
atrial/ventricular arrhythmias and a skeletal muscular dystrophy of the
quadriceps muscles. Affected members were found to carry the R377H
mutation, which was shown by transfection experiments in both muscular
and nonmuscular cells to lead to mislocalization of both lamin and
emerin (300384). Unlike previously reported cases of LMNA mutations
causing dilated cardiomyopathy with neuromuscular involvement, cardiac
involvement preceded neuromuscular disease in all affected members.
Charniot et al. (2003) suggested that factors other than the R377H
mutation influenced phenotypic expression in this family. Sebillon et
al. (2003) also reported on this family.

In a German woman with LGMD1B, Rudnik-Schoneborn et al. (2007)
identified a heterozygous R377H mutation in the LMNA gene. Family
history revealed that the patient's paternal grandmother had proximal
muscle weakness and died from heart disease at age 52, and a paternal
aunt had 'walking difficulties' since youth. The patient's father and 4
cousins all had cardiac disease without muscle weakness ranging from
nonspecific 'heart attacks' to dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia.
The only living affected cousin also carried the mutation.

Ben Yaou et al. (2007) identified a homozygous R298C mutation in a

In 5 consanguineous Italian families, Novelli et al. (2002) demonstrated
that individuals with mandibuloacral dysplasia (248370) were homozygous
for an arg527-to-his (R527H) mutation.

In affected members from 2 pedigrees with MADA, Simha et al. (2003)
identified the homozygous R527H mutation.

In a Mexican American boy with MADA born of related parents, Shen et al.
(2003) identified homozygosity for the R527H mutation. The authors noted
that all the patients reported by Novelli et al. (2002) shared a common
disease haplotype, but that the patients reported by Simha et al. (2003)
and their Mexican American patient had different haplotypes, indicating
independent origins of the mutation. The mutation is located within the
C-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain in the center of a beta sheet on
the domain surface of the protein.

Lombardi et al. (2007) identified this mutation in compound
heterozygosity with another missense mutation (150330.0044) in a patient
with an apparent MADA phenotype associated with muscular hyposthenia and
generalized hypotonia.

Garavelli et al. (2009) reported 2 unrelated patients with early
childhood onset of MADA features associated with a homozygous R527H
mutation. One presented at age 5 years, 3 months with bulbous distal
phalanges of fingers and was observed to have dysmorphic craniofacial
features, lipodystrophy type A, and acroosteolysis. The second child,
born of consanguineous Pakistani parents, presented at age 4 years, 2
months with a round face, chubby cheeks, thin nose, lipodystrophy type
A, and short, broad distal phalanges. Garavelli et al. (2009) emphasized
that features of this disorder may become apparent as early as preschool
age and that bulbous fingertips may be a clue to the diagnosis.

In 18 of 20 patients with classic Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome

transition, resulting in a silent gly-to-gly mutation at codon 608
(G608G) within exon 11 of the LMNA gene. This substitution created an
exonic consensus splice donor sequence and results in activation of a
cryptic splice site and deletion of 50 codons of prelamin A. This
mutation was not identified in any of the 16 parents available for
testing.

De Sandre-Giovannoli et al. (2003) identified the exon 11 cryptic splice
site activation mutation (1824C-T+1819-1968del) in 2 HGPS patients.
Immunocytochemical analyses of lymphocytes from 1 patient using specific
antibodies directed against lamin A/C, lamin A, and lamin B1 showed that
most cells had strikingly altered nuclear sizes and shapes, with
envelope interruptions accompanied by chromatin extrusion. Lamin A was
detected in 10 to 20% of HGPS lymphocytes. Only lamin C was present in
most cells, and lamin B1 was found in the nucleoplasm, suggesting that
it had dissociated from the nuclear envelope due to the loss of lamin A.
Western blot analysis showed 25% of normal lamin A levels, and no
truncated form was detected.

Cao and Hegele (2003) confirmed the observations of Eriksson et al.
(2003) using the same cell lines. They referred to this mutation as
2036C-T.

D'Apice et al. (2004) confirmed paternal age effect and demonstrated a
paternal origin of the 2036C-T mutation in 3 families with isolated
cases of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria.

By light and electron microscopy of fibroblasts from HGPS patients
carrying the 1824C-T mutation, Goldman et al. (2004) found significant
changes in nuclear shape, including lobulation of the nuclear envelope,
thickening of the nuclear lamina, loss of peripheral heterochromatin,
and clustering of nuclear pores. These structural defects worsened as
the HGPS cells aged in culture, and their severity correlated with an
apparent accumulation of mutant protein, which Goldman et al. (2004)
designated LA delta-50. Introduction of LA delta-50 into normal cells by
transfection or protein injection induced the same changes. Goldman et
al. (2004) hypothesized that the alterations in nuclear structure are
due to a concentration-dependent dominant-negative effect of LA
delta-50, leading to the disruption of lamin-related functions ranging
from the maintenance of nuclear shape to regulation of gene expression
and DNA replication.

In an infant with restrictive dermopathy (275210), Navarro et al. (2004)
identified the 1824C-T transition in heterozygous state.

In a patient with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria, Wuyts et al. (2005)
identified the G608G mutation. In lymphocyte DNA from the parents,
normal wildtype alleles were observed in the father, but a low signal
corresponding to the mutant allele was detected in the mother's DNA. A
segregation study confirmed that the patient's mutation was transmitted
from the mother, who showed germline and somatic mosaicism without
manifestations of HGPS.

Glynn and Glover (2005) studied the effects of farnesylation inhibition
on nuclear phenotypes in cells expressing normal and G608G-mutant lamin
A. Expression of a GFP-progerin fusion protein in normal fibroblasts
caused a high incidence of nuclear abnormalities (as seen in HGPS
fibroblasts), and resulted in abnormal nuclear localization of
GFP-progerin in comparison with the localization pattern of GFP-lamin A.
Expression of a GFP-lamin A fusion containing a mutation preventing the
final cleavage step, which caused the protein to remain farnesylated,
displayed identical localization patterns and nuclear abnormalities as
in HGPS cells and in cells expressing GFP-progerin. Exposure to a
farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI), PD169541, caused a significant
improvement in the nuclear morphology of cells expressing GFP-progerin
and in HGPS cells. Glynn and Glover (2005) proposed that abnormal
farnesylation of progerin may play a role in the cellular phenotype in
HGPS cells, and suggested that FTIs may represent a therapeutic option
for patients with HGPS.

In cells from a female patient with HGPS due to the 1824C-T mutation,
Shumaker et al. (2006) found that the inactive X chromosome showed loss
of histone H3 trimethylation of lys27 (H3K27me3), a marker for
facultative heterochromatin, as well as loss of histone H3
trimethylation of lys9 (H3K9me3), a marker of pericentric constitutive
heterochromatin. Other alterations in epigenetic control included
downregulation of the EZH2 methyltransferase (601573), upregulation of
pericentric satellite III repeat transcripts, and increase in the
trimethylation of H4K20. The epigenetic alterations were observed before
the pathogenic changes in nuclear shape. The findings indicated that the
mutant LMNA protein alters sites of histone methylation known to
regulate heterochromatin and provided evidence that the rapid aging
phenotype of HGPS reflects aspects of normal aging at the molecular
level.

Moulson et al. (2007) demonstrated that HGPS cells with the common
1824C-T LMNA mutation produced about 37.5% of wildtype full-length
transcript, which was higher than previous estimates (Reddel and Weiss,
2004).

Using real-time RT-PCR, Rodriguez et al. (2009) found that progerin
transcripts were expressed in dermal fibroblasts cultured from normal
controls, but at a level more than 160-fold lower than that detected in
dermal fibroblasts cultured from HGPS patients. The level of progerin
transcripts, but not of lamin A or lamin C transcripts, increased in
late-passage cells from both normal controls and HGPS patients.

HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME
LMNA, GLY608SER

In a patient with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (176670),
Eriksson et al. (2003) identified a G-to-A transition in the LMNA gene
resulting in a gly-to-ser substitution at codon 608 (G608S). This
mutation was not identified in either parent.

Cao and Hegele (2003) confirmed the observation of Eriksson et al.
(2003) using the same cell line.

.0024
HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME, ATYPICAL
LMNA, GLU145LYS

In a patient with somewhat atypical features of progeria (176670),
Eriksson et al. (2003) identified a glu-to-lys substitution at codon 145
(E145K) in exon 2 of the LMNA gene. This mutation was not identified in
either parent. Atypical clinical features, including persistence of
coarse hair over the head, ample subcutaneous tissue over the arms and
legs, and severe strokes beginning at age 4, may subtly distinguish this
phenotype from classic HGPS.

.0025
MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY, ATYPICAL
LMNA, ARG471CYS

In a patient with an apparently typical progeria phenotype (176670) who
was 28 years old at the time that DNA was obtained, Cao and Hegele
(2003) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in
the LMNA gene. One mutation, arg471 to cys (R471C), resulted from a
1623C-T transition. An arg527-to-cys (R527C) substitution (150330.0026),
resulting from a 1791C-T transition, was found on the other allele.
These mutations were not identified in any of 100 control chromosomes.
Parental DNA for this patient and a clinical description of the parents
were not available. Brown (2004) reported that both he and the patient's
physician, Francis Collins, concluded that the patient had
mandibuloacral dysplasia (248370).

Zirn et al. (2008) reported a 7-year-old Turkish girl, born of
consanguineous parents, who was homozygous for the R471C mutation. She
had a phenotype most consistent with an atypical form of MADA, including
lipodystrophy, a progeroid appearance, and congenital muscular dystrophy
with rigid spine syndrome. These latter features were reminiscent of
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (181350), although there was no
cardiac involvement. She presented at age 10 months with proximal muscle
weakness, contractures, spinal rigidity, and a dystrophic skeletal
muscle biopsy. Characteristic progeroid features and features of
lipodystrophy and mandibuloacral dysplasia were noted at age 3 years and
became more apparent with age. Zirn et al. (2008) commented on the
severity of the phenotype and emphasized the phenotypic variability in
patients with LMNA mutations.

LIPODYSTROPHY, FAMILIAL PARTIAL, TYPE 2
HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME, CHILDHOOD-ONSET, INCLUDED
LMNA, ARG133LEU

In a male patient whose phenotype associated generalized acquired
lipoatrophy with insulin-resistant diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and
hepatic steatosis (151660), Caux et al. (2003) found a heterozygous
398G-T transversion in exon 2 of the LMNA gene that resulted in an
arg-to-leu change at codon 133 (R133L) in the dimerization rod domain of
lamins A and C. The patient also had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with
valvular involvement and disseminated whitish papules.
Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis of the patient's cultured skin
fibroblasts revealed nuclear disorganization and abnormal distribution
of A-type lamins, similar to that observed in patients harboring other
LMNA mutations. This observation broadened the clinical spectrum of
laminopathies, pointing out the clinical variability of lipodystrophy
and the possibility of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and skin involvement.

In 2 unrelated persons with a progeroid syndrome (see 176670), Chen et
al. (2003) found heterozygosity for the R1333L mutation in the LMNA
gene. One was a white Portuguese female who presented at the age of 9
years with short stature. She showed scleroderma-like skin changes and
graying/thinning of hair. Type 2 diabetes developed at the age of 23
years. Hypogonadism, osteoporosis, and voice changes were also present.
The other patient was an African American female in whom the diagnosis
of a progeroid syndrome was made at the age of 18 years.
Scleroderma-like skin, short stature, graying/thinning of hair, and type
2 diabetes at the age of 18 years were features. The deceased father,
paternal aunt, and paternal grandmother of this patient were also
diagnosed with severe insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus, suggesting
that the R133L mutation might have been paternally inherited. It is
noteworthy that a substitution in the same codon, R133P (150330.0032),
was reported in a 40-year-old patient with Emery-Dreifuss muscular
dystrophy who had disease onset at age 7 years and atrial fibrillation
at age 32 years (Brown et al., 2001). Although Chen et al. (2003)
designated these patients as having 'atypical Werner syndrome' (277700),
Hegele (2003) suggested that the patients more likely had late-onset
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.

Vigouroux et al. (2003) emphasized that a striking feature in the
patient reported by Caux et al. (2003) was muscular hypertrophy of the
limbs, which contrasts with the muscular atrophy usually present in
Werner syndrome. Muscular hypertrophy, along with insulin-resistant
diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, is more often associated with
LMNA-linked Dunnigan lipodystrophy. Fibroblasts from their patient
showed nuclear abnormalities identical to those described in Dunnigan
lipodystrophy (Vigouroux et al., 2001).

Jacob et al. (2005) studied the pattern of body fat distribution and
metabolic abnormalities in the 2 patients with atypical Werner syndrome
described by Chen et al. (2003). Patient 1, an African American female,
had normal body fat (27%) by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).
However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed relative paucity of
subcutaneous fat in the distal extremities, with preservation of
subcutaneous truncal fat. She had impaired glucose tolerance and
elevated postprandial serum insulin levels. In contrast, patient 2, a
Caucasian female, had only 11.6% body fat as determined by DEXA and had
generalized loss of subcutaneous and intraabdominal fat on MRI. She had
hypertriglyceridemia and severe insulin-resistant diabetes requiring
more than 200 U of insulin daily. Skin fibroblasts showed markedly
abnormal nuclear morphology compared with those from patient 1. Despite
the deranged nuclear morphology, the lamin A/C remained localized to the
nuclear envelope, and the nuclear DNA remained within the nucleus. Jacob
et al. (2005) concluded that atypical Werner syndrome associated with an
R133L mutation in the LMNA gene is phenotypically heterogeneous.
Furthermore, the severity of metabolic complications seemed to correlate
with the extent of lipodystrophy.

CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1A
LMNA, GLU161LYS

Sebillon et al. (2003) described a family with a history of sudden
cardiac death, congestive heart failure, and dilated cardiomyopathy
(CMD1A; 115200). Five affected members had a heterozygous 481G-A
transition in exon 2 of the LMNA gene, resulting in a glu161-to-lys
(E161K) mutation. Dilated cardiomyopathy was present in only 2 patients,
in whom onset of the disease was characterized by congestive heart
failure and atrial fibrillation (at 29 and 44 years, respectively);
heart transplantation was performed in both patients (at 34 and 51 years
of age). In the 3 other affected members, the onset of disease was also
characterized by atrial fibrillation at 22, 49, and 63 years, but
without dilated cardiomyopathy. A 16-year-old male and 12-year-old
female were also heterozygous for the mutation, but had no signs or
symptoms of heart disease. The 5 affected members were a mother and 2
daughters in 1 branch of the family and 2 brothers in another branch.
Two cardiac deaths were reported in the family history: sudden death at
38 years and congestive heart failure at 68 years. No significant
atrioventricular block was observed in the family, except in 1 patient
for whom cardiac pacing was necessary at 67 years of age because of
sinoatrial block coexisting with atrial fibrillation. Sebillon et al.
(2003) concluded that the phenotype in this family was characterized by
early atrial fibrillation preceding or coexisting with dilated
cardiomyopathy, without significant atrioventricular block, and without
neuromuscular abnormalities.

.0029
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1A
LMNA, 1-BP INS, 28A

Sebillon et al. (2003) described a family in which 5 patients with
dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200) were
heterozygous for a 1-bp insertion, 28insA, in exon 1 of the LMNA gene.
Three additional patients were considered as phenotypically affected
with documented dilated cardiomyopathy but were not available for DNA
analysis. In the family history, there were 3 cardiac sudden deaths
before 55 years of age. In the patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, 3
had associated atrioventricular block requiring pacemaker implantation,
1 had premature ventricular beats leading to a cardioverter
defibrillator implantation, and 1 had a mild form of skeletal muscular
dystrophy (mild weakness and wasting of quadriceps muscles, as well as
myogenic abnormalities on electromyogram).

.0030
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, WITH HYPERGONADOTRIPIC HYPOGONADISM
LMNA, ALA57PRO

In an Iranian female with short stature and a progeroid syndrome (see
176670), Chen et al. (2003) found a heterozygous de novo ala57-to-pro
substitution (A57P) resulting from a 584G-C transversion in the LMNA
gene. Onset occurred in her early teens, and she was 23 years old at
diagnosis. Hypogonadism, osteoporosis, osteosclerosis of digits, and
dilated cardiomyopathy were described. Although Chen et al. (2003)
designated this patient as having 'atypical Werner syndrome' (277700),
Hegele (2003) suggested that the patient more likely had late-onset
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.

McPherson et al. (2009) suggested that the patient in whom Chen et al.
(2003) identified an A57P LMNA mutation had a distinct phenotype
involving dilated cardiomyopathy and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism
(212112).

.0031
HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME, CHILDHOOD-ONSET
LMNA, LEU140ARG

In a white Norwegian male with a progeroid syndrome (see 176670), Chen
et al. (2003) found a leu140-to-arg (L140R) substitution resulting from
an 834T-G transversion in the LMNA gene. The patient had onset at age 14
of cataracts, scleroderma-like skin, and graying/thinning of hair, as
well as hypogonadism, osteoporosis, soft tissue calcification, and
premature atherosclerosis. Aortic stenosis and insufficiency were also
present. The patient died at the age of 36 years. Although Chen et al.
(2003) designated this patient as having 'atypical Werner syndrome'
(277700), Hegele (2003) suggested that the patient more likely had
late-onset Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.

.0032
EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
LMNA, ARG133PRO

In a 40-year-old patient with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (181350)
who had disease onset at age 7 years and atrial fibrillation at age 32
years, Brown et al. (2001) found an arg133-to-pro (R133P) mutation in
the LMNA gene. Chen et al. (2003) noted that the same codon is involved
in the arg133-to-leu (150330.0027) mutation in atypical Werner syndrome.

.0033
MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY
LMNA, LYS542ASN

In 4 affected members of a consanguineous family from north India with
features of MADA (248370). Plasilova et al. (2004) identified a
homozygous 1626G-C transversion in exon 10 of the LMNA gene, resulting
in a lys542-to-asn (K542N) substitution. The parents and 1 unaffected
daughter were heterozygous for the mutation. Patients in this family
showed uniform skeletal malformations such as acroosteolysis of the
digits, micrognathia, and clavicular aplasia/hypoplasia, characteristic
of mandibuloacral dysplasia. However, the patients also had classic
features of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (176670). Plasilova et
al. (2004) suggested that autosomal recessive HGPS and MADA may
represent a single disorder with varying degrees of severity.

.0034
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL, LMNA-RELATED
LMNA, SER143PHE

In a young girl with congenital muscular dystrophy and progeroid
features (see 613205), Kirschner et al. (2005) identified a 1824C-T
transition in the LMNA gene, resulting in a de novo heterozygous
missense mutation, ser143 to phe (S143F). The child presented during the
first year of life with myopathy with marked axial weakness, feeding
difficulties, poor head control and axial weakness. Progeroid features,
including growth failure, sclerodermatous skin changes, and osteolytic
lesions, developed later. At routine examination at age 8 years, she was
found to have a mediolateral myocardial infarction.

In cultured skin fibroblasts derived from the patient reported by
Kirschner et al. (2005), Kandert et al. (2007) found dysmorphic nuclei
with blebs and lobulations that accumulated progressively with cell
passage. Immunofluorescent staining showed altered lamin A/C
organization and aggregate formation. There was aberrant localization of
lamin-associated proteins, particularly emerin (EMD; 300384) and
nesprin-2 (SYNE2; 608442), which was reduced or absent from the nuclear
envelope. However, a subset of mutant cells expressing the giant 800-kD
isoform of SYNE2 showed a milder phenotype, suggesting that this isoform
exerts a protective effect. Proliferating cells were observed to express
the 800-kD SYNE2 isoform, whereas nonproliferating cells did not. In
addition, mutant cells showed defects in the intranuclear organization
of acetylated histones and RNA polymerase II compared to control cells.
The findings indicated that the S143F mutant protein affects nuclear
envelope architecture and composition, chromatin organization, gene
expression, and transcription. The findings also implicated nesprin-2 as
a structural reinforcer at the nuclear envelope.

.0035
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, LIMB-GIRDLE, TYPE 1B
LMNA, TYR259TER

In 9 affected members of Dutch family with limb-girdle muscular
dystrophy type 1B (159001), van Engelen et al. (2005) identified a
777T-A transversion in the LMNA gene, resulting in a tyr259-to-ter
substitution (Y259X). The heterozygous Y259X mutation led to a classic
LGMD1B phenotype. One infant homozygous for the mutation was born of
consanguineous parents who were both affected, and delivered at 30
weeks' gestational age by cesarean section because of decreasing cardiac
rhythm. The infant died at birth from very severe generalized muscular
dystrophy. Cultured skin fibroblasts from the infant showed complete
absence of A-type lamins leading to disorganization of the lamina,
alterations in the protein composition of the inner nuclear membrane,
and decreased life span. Van Engelen et al. (2005) noted that the
fibroblasts from this child showed remarkable similarity, in nuclear
architectural defects and in decreased life span, to the fibroblasts of
homozygous LMNA (L530P/L530P) mice (Mounkes et al., 2003).

.0036
RESTRICTIVE DERMOPATHY, LETHAL
HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME, INCLUDED
LMNA, IVS11, G-A, +1

In a premature infant who died at 6 months of age due to restrictive
dermopathy (275210), Navarro et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous
G-to-A transition at position 1 in the intron 11 donor site of the LMNA
gene (IVS11+1G-A), resulting in loss of exon 11 from the transcript. The
patient expressed lamins A and C and a truncated prelamin A.

In a patient with an extremely severe form of HGPS (176670), Moulson et
al. (2007) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition at the +1
position of the donor splice site of intron 11 in the LMNA gene
(1968+1G-A). RT-PCR studies showed a truncated protein product identical
to that observed in HGPS cell lines with the common 1824C-T mutation
(150330.0022), indicating that the new mutation resulted in the abnormal
use of the same cryptic exon 11 splice site. The findings were in
contrast to those reported by Navarro et al. (2004), who observed
skipping of exon 11 with 1968+1G-A. Further quantitative studies of the
patient's cells by Moulson et al. (2007) found a 4.5-fold increase in
the relative ratio of mutant mRNA and protein to wildtype prelamin A
compared to typical HGPS cells. The findings were confirmed by Western
blot analysis and provided an explanation for the severe phenotype
observed in this patient. He had had abnormally thick and tight skin
observed at 11 weeks of age, and developed more typical but severe
progeroid features over time. He died of infection at age 3.5 years.

MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY
LMNA, ALA529VAL

In 2 unrelated Turkish patients with mandibuloacral dysplasia with type
A lipodystrophy (248370), a 21-year-old woman previously described by
Cogulu et al. (2003) and an 18-year-old man, Garg et al. (2005)
identified homozygosity for a 1586C-T transition in the LMNA gene,
resulting in an ala529-to-val (A529V) substitution. Intragenic SNPs
revealed a common haplotype spanning 2.5 kb around the mutated
nucleotide in the parents of both patients, suggesting ancestral origin
of the mutation. The female patient had no breast development despite
normal menstruation, a phenotype different from that seen in women with
the R527H mutation (150330.0021).

.0038
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, LIMB-GIRDLE, TYPE 1B
LMNA, GLN493TER

In a German woman with LGMD1B (159001), Rudnik-Schoneborn et al. (2007)
identified a heterozygous 1477C-T transition in exon 8 of the LMNA gene,
resulting in a gln493-to-ter (Q493X) substitution. She presented with
slowly progressive proximal muscle weakness beginning in the lower
extremities and later involving the upper extremities. EMG showed both
neurogenic and myopathic defects in the quadriceps muscle. At age 53
years, she was diagnosed with atrioventricular conduction block and
arrhythmia requiring pacemaker implantation. Family history showed that
her mother had walking difficulties from age 40 years and died of a
heart attack at age 54. Six other deceased family members had suspected
cardiomyopathy without muscle involvement.

.0039
LIPODYSTROPHY, FAMILIAL PARTIAL, TYPE 2
LMNA, IVS8, G-C, +5

Morel et al. (2006) reported 2 sisters, the children of
nonconsanguineous Punjabi parents, with familial partial lipodystrophy
type 2 (FPLD2; 151660). The first presented with acanthosis nigricans at
age 5 years, diabetes with insulin resistance, hypertension, and
hypertriglyceridemia at age 13 years, and partial lipodystrophy starting
at puberty. Her sister and their mother had a similar metabolic profile
and physical features, and their mother died of vascular disease at age
32 years. LMNA sequencing showed that the sisters were each heterozygous
for a novel G-to-C mutation at the intron 8 consensus splice donor site,
which was absent from the genomes of 300 healthy individuals. The
retention of intron 8 in mRNA predicted a prematurely truncated lamin A
isoform (516 instead of 664 amino acids) with 20 nonsense 3-prime
terminal residues. The authors concluded that this was the first LMNA
splicing mutation to be associated with FPLD2, and that it causes a
severe clinical and metabolic phenotype.

.0040
HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME
LMNA, VAL607VAL

In a patient with a severe form of HGPS (176670), Moulson et al. (2007)
identified a de novo heterozygous 1821G-A transition in exon 11 of the
LMNA gene, resulting in a val607-to-val (V607V) substitution. The
1821G-A mutation favored the use of the same cryptic splice site as the
common 1824C-T mutation (150330.0022) and produced the same resultant
progerin product. However, the ratio of mutant to wildtype mRNA and
protein was increased in the patient compared to typical HGPS cells. The
patient had flexion contractures, thick and tight skin, and other severe
progeroid features. He died of infection at 26 days of age.

LMNA, SER573LEU

In a 50-year-old Italian woman with sporadic dilated cardiomyopathy with
conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200), Taylor et al. (2003) identified
heterozygosity for a 1718C-T transition in exon 11 of the LMNA gene,
resulting in a ser573-to-leu substitution at a highly conserved residue,
predicted to affect the carboxyl tail of the lamin A isoform. The
mutation was not found in the proband's 2 unaffected offspring or in 300
control chromosomes, but her unaffected 60-year-old sister also carried
the mutation.

Van Esch et al. (2006) analyzed the LMNA gene in a 44-year-old male of
European descent with arthropathy, tendinous calcifications, and a
progeroid appearance (see 248370) and identified homozygosity for the
S573L mutation. Progeroid features included a small pinched nose, small
lips, micrognathia with crowded teeth, cataract, and alopecia. He also
had generalized lipodystrophy, and sclerodermatous skin. The arthropathy
affected predominantly the distal femora and proximal tibia in the knee
with tendinous calcifications. However, he had normal clavicles and no
evidence of acroosteolysis. The authors concluded that he had a novel
phenotype. The patient's unaffected 15-year-old son was heterozygous for
the mutation, which was not found in 450 control chromosomes. The
authors noted that the patient had no evidence of cardiomyopathy and his
70-year-old mother, an obligate heterozygote, had no known cardiac
problems.

In a 75-year-old European male with partial lipodystrophy (151660),
Lanktree et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for the S573L mutation
in the LMNA gene.

In a 46-year-old South Asian female with partial lipodystrophy (151660),
Lanktree et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a 688G-A transition
in exon 4 of the LMNA gene, resulting in an asp230-to-asn (D230N)
substitution at a conserved residue located 5-prime to the nuclear
localization signal. The mutation, predicted to affect only the lamin A
isoform, was not found in 200 controls of multiple ethnic backgrounds.

LMNA, ARG399CYS

In a 50-year-old European female with partial lipodystrophy (151660),
Lanktree et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a 1195C-T
transition in exon 7 of the LMNA gene, resulting in an arg399-to-cys
(R399C) substitution at a conserved residue located 5-prime to the
nuclear localization signal. The mutation, predicted to affect only the
lamin A isoform, was not found in 200 controls of multiple ethnic
backgrounds.

Decaudain et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous R399 mutation in a
woman with severe metabolic syndrome. She was diagnosed with
insulin-resistant diabetes at age 32. Chronic hyperglycemia led to
retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and renal failure. She had severe
hypertriglyceridemia and diffuse atherosclerosis, requiring coronary
artery bypass at age 49. Physical examination revealed android fat
distribution with lipoatrophy of lower limbs and calves hypertrophy
without any muscle weakness. Her mother and a brother had diabetes and
died several years earlier.

MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY, ATYPICAL
LMNA, VAL440MET

In a 27-year-old Italian woman with a mandibuloacral dysplasia type A
(MADA; 248370)-like phenotype, Lombardi et al. (2007) found compound
heterozygosity for missense mutations in the LMNA cDNA: a G-to-A
transition at position 1318 in exon 7 that gave rise to a val-to-met
substitution at codon 440 (V440M), and an R527H substitution
(150330.0021). Each healthy parent was a simple heterozygote for one or
the other mutation. The apparent MADA phenotype was associated with
muscular hyposthenia and generalized hypotonia. Clavicular hypoplasia
and metabolic imbalances were absent. Lombardi et al. (2007)
hypothesized that lack of homozygosity for the R527H mutation attenuated
the MADA phenotype, while the V440M mutation may have contributed to
both the muscle phenotype and the pathogenic effect of the single R527H
mutation.

HEART-HAND SYNDROME, SLOVENIAN TYPE
LMNA, IVS9AS, T-G, -12

In affected members of a Slovenian family with heart-hand syndrome
(610140), originally reported by Sinkovec et al. (2005), Renou et al.
(2008) identified heterozygosity for a T-G transversion in intron 9 of
the LMNA gene (IVS9-12T-G), predicted to cause a frameshift and
premature termination in exon 10, with the addition of 14 new amino
acids at the C terminus. The mutation was not found in unaffected family
members or in 100 healthy controls. Analysis of fibroblasts from 2
affected individuals confirmed the presence of truncated protein and
revealed aberrant localization of lamin A/C accumulated in intranuclear
foci as well as dysmorphic nuclei with nuclear envelope herniations.

.0046
MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY
LMNA, ALA529THR

In a 56-year-old Japanese woman, born of consanguineous parents, with
mandibuloacral dysplasia and type A lipodystrophy (248370), Kosho et al.
(2007) identified a homozygous 1585G-A transition in exon 9 of the LMNA
gene, resulting in an ala529-to-thr (A529T) substitution. The authors
stated that she was the oldest reported patient with the disorder. In
addition to classic MAD with lipodystrophy type A phenotype, including
progeroid appearance, acroosteolysis of the distal phalanges, and loss
of subcutaneous fat in the limbs, she had severe progressive destructive
skeletal and osteoporotic changes. Vertebral collapse led to paralysis.
However, Kosho et al. (2007) also noted that other factors may have
contributed to the severe osteoporosis observed in this patient. Another
mutation in this codon, A529V (150330.0037), results in a similar
phenotype.

.0047
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL, LMNA-RELATED
LMNA, LEU380SER

In a 7-year-old boy with a LNMA-related congenital muscular dystrophy
(613205), Quijano-Roy et al. (2008) identified a de novo heterozygous
mutation in exon 6 of the LMNA gene, resulting in a leu380-to-ser
(L380S) substitution. He showed decreased movements in utero, hypotonia,
talipes foot deformities, no head or trunk control, distal joint
contractures, respiratory insufficiency, and paroxysmal atrial
tachycardia. Serum creatine kinase was increased, and muscle biopsy
showed dystrophic changes.

.0048
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL, LMNA-RELATED
LMNA, ARG249TRP

In a 9-year-old girl with congenital muscular dystrophy (613205),
Quijano-Roy et al. (2008) identified a de novo heterozygous mutation in
exon 4 of the LMNA gene, resulting in an arg249-to-trp (R249W)
substitution. She presented at age 3 to 6 months with axial weakness and
talipes foot deformities. She lost head support at 9 months, had
respiratory insufficiency, joint contractures, and axial and limb muscle
weakness. A de novo heterozygous R249W mutation was also identified in
an unrelated 3-year-old boy with congenital LGMD1B who showed decreased
movements in utero, hypotonia, distal contractures, no head or trunk
control, and respiratory insufficiency. Both patients had increased
serum creatine kinase and showed myopathic changes on EMG studies.

.0049
EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL, LMNA-RELATED, INCLUDED;;
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, LIMB-GIRDLE, TYPE 1B, INCLUDED
LMNA, GLU358LYS

Mercuri et al. (2004) identified a de novo heterozygous 1072G-A
transition in exon 5 of the LMNA gene, resulting in a glu358-to-lys
(E358K) substitution in 5 unrelated patients with muscular dystrophy.
Three patients had the common phenotype of autosomal dominant
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (181350), 1 had early-onset LGMD1B
(159001), and the last had had a more severe disorder consistent with
congenital muscular dystrophy (613205). The mutation was not identified
in 150 controls. The patient with LGMD1B also had cardiac conduction
abnormalities, respiratory failure, and features of lipodystrophy
(151660). Mercuri et al. (2004) commented on the extreme phenotypic
variability associated with this mutation.

In 4 unrelated patients with LMNA-related congenital muscular dystrophy,
Quijano-Roy et al. (2008) identified a de novo heterozygous mutation in
exon 6 of the LMNA gene, resulting in a glu358-to-lys (E358K)
substitution. Three patients presented before 1 year of age with
hypotonia and later developed head drop with neck muscle weakness. There
was delayed motor development with early loss of ambulation, distal limb
contractures, axial and limb muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency
requiring mechanical ventilation, increased serum creatine kinase, and
dystrophic changes on muscle biopsy. One patient developed ventricular
tachycardia at age 20 years. The fourth patient with congenital LGMD1B
had decreased fetal movements and presented at age 3 to 6 months with
hypotonia, loss of head control, and delayed motor development.

.0050
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL, LMNA-RELATED
LMNA, 3-BP DEL, 94AAG

In an 18-month-old boy with LMNA-related congenital muscular dystrophy
(613205), D'Amico et al. (2005) identified a de novo heterozygous 3-bp
deletion (94delAAG) in exon 1 of the LMNA gene, resulting in the
deletion of lys32. Although he had normal early motor development, he
showed prominent neck extensor weakness resulting in a 'dropped head'
phenotype at age 1 year. He was able to stand independently but had some
difficulty walking.

.0051
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
LMNA, ARG644CYS

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to various phenotypes has not been confirmed.

An arg644-to-cys (R644C) mutation in the LMNA gene has been found in
several different phenotypic presentations (Genschel et al., 2001;
Mercuri et al., 2005; Rankin et al., 2008); however, the pathogenicity
of the mutation has not been confirmed (Moller et al., 2009).

In a German patient with dilated cardiomyopathy with no history history
of conduction system disease (see 152000), Genschel et al. (2001)
identified heterozygosity for a 1930C-T transition in exon 11 of the
LMNA gene resulting in an R644C substitution in the C-terminal domain of
lamin A. The authors noted that the mutation is solely within lamin A,
but not lamin C, whereas previously reported mutations causing dilated
cardiomyopathy are located more in the rod domain of the protein.

Mercuri et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for the R644C mutation
in 4 patients with skeletal and cardiac muscle involvement of varying
severity. In 1 patient, the mutation was found in the affected brother
and the unaffected father, and was not found in the affected mother. The
mutation was not found in 100 unrelated control subjects.

Rankin et al. (2008) described 9 patients in 8 families with the same
mutation. Patients 1 and 2 presented with lipodystrophy and insulin
resistance; patient 1 also had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.
Patient 3 presented with motor neuropathy, patient 4 with arthrogryposis
and dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular noncompaction, patient
5 with severe scoliosis and contractures, patient 6 with limb-girdle
weakness, and patient 7 with hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance.
Patients 8 and 9 were brothers who had proximal weakness and
contractures. The same LMNA was identified in 9 unaffected individuals
in these 9 families, but was not detected in 200 German and 300 British
controls. Rankin et al. (2008) suggested that extreme phenotypic
diversity and low penetrance are associated with the R644C mutation.

.0052
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, WITH HYPERGONADOTRIPIC HYPOGONADISM
LMNA, LEU59ARG

In a 17-year-old Caucasian female with dilated cardiomyopathy and
ovarian failure (212112), Nguyen et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity
for a de novo 176T-C transition in exon 1 of the LMNA gene, predicted to
result in a leu59-to-arg (L59R) substitution. Analysis of nuclear
morphology in patient fibroblasts showed more irregularity and variation
than that of control fibroblasts, with denting, blebbing, and irregular
margins. The mutation was not found in the unaffected parents or in 116
population-based controls.

In a 15-year-old Caucasian girl with dilated cardiomyopathy and ovarian
failure who died from an arrhythmia while awaiting cardiac
transplantation, McPherson et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for
the L59R mutation in the LMNA gene. The mutation was presumed to be de
novo, although the unaffected parents declined DNA testing. The patient
also had a healthy older sister, and there was no family history of
cardiomyopathy or hypogonadism.

.0053
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1A
LMNA, ARG541GLY

In 2 sibs with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1A; 115200), Malek et al.
(2011) identified a heterozygous 1621C-G transversion in exon 10 of the
LMNA gene, resulting in an arg541-to-gly (R541G) substitution in the
C-terminal tail region. The 23-year-old male proband had a history of
paroxysmal atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and was found by
echocardiogram to have dilation of the left ventricle and global
hypokinesis. Cardiac MRI showed discrete regional areas of akinesis with
muscle thinning in the left ventricle and marked hypertrabeculation in
dysfunctional regions, as well as evidence of fibrosis. The proband's
sister had sinus bradycardia and supraventricular and ventricular
arrhythmias, but normal echocardiogram and cardiac MRI. The sibs' father
and paternal aunt had both died of dilated cardiomyopathy. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the R541G mutant resulted in
the formation of abnormal lamin aggregates, most of which were
sickle-shaped, suggesting aberrant formation of the inner nuclear lamina
from misassembled lamin dimers.

611083	TITLE *611083 ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE, IRON-CONTAINING, 1; ADHFE1
;;HYDROXYACID-OXOACID TRANSHYDROGENASE; HOT;;
ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE 8; ADH8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ADHFE1 gene encodes hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase (EC
1.1.99.24), which is responsible for the oxidation of 4-hydroxybutyrate
in mammalian tissues (Kardon et al., 2006).

CLONING

Deng et al. (2002) cloned a novel iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenase
(ADH) cDNA, designated ADHFE1, from a human fetal brain cDNA library.
ADHFE1 encodes a deduced 467-amino acid protein with a predicted
molecular mass of 50 kD. The protein shares 21 to 38% sequence identity
with the type III ADHs of microbial organisms and 88%, 67%, and 53%
identity with homologs in mouse, Drosophila, and C. elegans,
respectively. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.4-kb transcript in
liver only. MTC-panel screening PCR detected expression in adult liver,
kidney, thymus, and spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

Kardon et al. (2006) demonstrated that overexpression of mouse Adhfe1 in
human embryonic kidney cells catalyzed the oxidation of
4-hydroxybutyrate to succinate semialdehyde. Adhfe1 enzyme activity
required both 4-hydroxybutyrate and alpha-ketoglutarate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Deng et al. (2002) determined that the ADHFE1 gene contains 14 exons and
spans more than 36 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Deng et al. (2002) mapped the ADHFE1 gene
to chromosome 8q12.3-q13.1. By the same method, Kardon et al. (2006)
mapped the gene to 8q13.1.

607031	TITLE *607031 LIPOIC ACID SYNTHASE; LIAS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching for sequences showing homology with S.
cerevisiae lipoic acid synthase, Stanchi et al. (2001) identified human
LIAS. The deduced 113-amino acid protein shares 60% identity with the S.
cerevisiae enzyme. Morikawa et al. (2001) designed PCR primers based on
the Arabidopsis lipoic acid synthase sequence and used the resultant
product to clone Lias from a mouse heart cDNA library. The deduced
373-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 42 kD.
The N-terminal 26 amino acids encode a potential mitochondrial targeting
presequence that, upon removal, would result in a deduced mature protein
of 347 amino acids with a molecular mass of about 39 kD. Northern blot
analysis detected expression of a 1.8-kb message predominantly in heart,
testis, and liver. Transfection of fluorescence-tagged Lias into CHO
cells revealed intracellular localization that overlapped with a
mitochondrial marker.

GENE FUNCTION

With use of E. coli cells deficient in lipoic acid synthase, Morikawa et
al. (2001) confirmed that mouse Lias encodes a lipoic acid synthase.
Transformation of the mutant E. coli cells with plasmid carrying mouse
Lias restored the ability of the cells to grow in lipoic acid-free
medium. Mouse Lias with the N-terminal 26-amino acid deletion enhanced
the growth of the mutant to near normal levels.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By autozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene analysis of a boy
with early-onset lactic acidosis and encephalopathy due to pyruvate
dehydrogenase lipoic acid synthetase deficiency (PDHLD; 614462), Mayr et
al. (2011) identified a homozygous mutation in the LIAS gene
(607031.0001). On day 3 of life, the patient developed seizures,
hypotonia, and poor sucking. His condition worsened, and he developed
recurrent episodes of apnea and reduced consciousness associated with
increased serum lactate. On day 11 of life, he had further metabolic
deterioration, with acute respiratory deficiency necessitating
artificial ventilation for 17 days. Urinalysis showed increased glutaric
acid and glycine, and plasma glycine was also increased. After
stabilization, the child had severely retarded psychomotor development,
spastic tetraparesis with contractures, epilepsy, microcephaly, and
intermittently increased serum lactate. He died at home at age 4 years
from a respiratory tract infection. Muscle biopsy at age 11 months
showed a severe defect in mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation.
Immunohistochemical and immunoblot studies showed a decrease in the E2
(608770)- and E3 (238331)-binding proteins of the pyruvate dehydrogenase
complex, the E2 subunit of alpha-ketoglutarate (126063), and lipoic
acid. Increased glycine in the patient reflected a defect in lipoic acid
metabolism because this cofactor is also needed for glycine cleavage.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PYRUVATE DEHYDROGENASE LIPOIC ACID SYNTHETASE DEFICIENCY
LIAS, ARG249HIS

In a patient with pyruvate dehydrogenase lipoic acid synthetase
deficiency (PDHLD; 614462) manifest as early-onset seizures,
encephalomyopathy, and lactic acidosis, Mayr et al. (2011) identified a
homozygous 746G-A transition in exon 8 of the LIAS gene, resulting in an
arg249-to-his (R249H) substitution in a highly conserved residue. In
vitro functional expression studies in E. coli showed that the mutation
caused a growth defect when grown in the absence of lipoic acid,
consistent with a loss of function.

611137	TITLE *611137 PROTEASOME SUBUNIT, BETA-TYPE, 11; PSMB11
;;PROTEASOME SUBUNIT, BETA-5 FAMILY, THYMUS-SPECIFIC;;
PROTEASOME SUBUNIT BETA-5T
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteasomes generate peptides that are presented by major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) I molecules to other cells of the
immune system. Proteolysis is conducted by 20S proteasomes, complexes of
28 subunits arranged as a cylinder in 4 heteroheptameric rings: alpha-1
to -7, beta-1 to -7, beta-1 to -7, and alpha-1 to -7. The catalytic
subunits are beta-1 (PSMB6; 600307), beta-2 (PSMB7; 604030), and beta-5
(PSMB5; 600306). Three additional subunits, beta-1i (PSMB9; 177045),
beta-2i (PSMB10; 176847), and beta-5i (PSMB8; 177046), are induced by
gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) and are preferentially incorporated into
proteasomes to make immunoproteasomes. PSMB11, or beta-5t, is a
catalytic subunit expressed exclusively in cortical thymic epithelial
cells (Murata et al., 2007).

CLONING

By searching databases for proteasome-related genes, followed by PCR of
HeLa cell genomic DNA, Murata et al. (2007) cloned human PSMB11, which
they called beta-5t. The beta-5t protein was most homologous to beta-5
and beta-5i. Northern and Western blot analyses of mouse tissues showed
that beta-5t was expressed exclusively in thymus. Immunohistochemical
analysis detected beta-5t expression in mouse cortical thymic epithelial
cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Murata et al. (2007) found that
about 20% of 20S proteasomes in mouse thymus contained beta-5t instead
of beta-5 or beta-5i. Moreover, these beta-5t-containing proteasomes, or
thymoproteasomes, preferentially incorporated beta-1i and beta-2i in
place of beta-1 and beta-2, respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Murata et al. (2007) determined that the PSMB11 gene contains 1 exon in
both mice and humans.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Murata et al. (2007) mapped the PSMB11
gene to chromosome 14, adjacent to the PSMB5 gene on the opposite
strand.

ANIMAL MODEL

Murata et al. (2007) found that mice deficient in beta-5t had fewer Cd8
(see 186910) single-positive (SP) thymocytes, but normal numbers of Cd4
(186940) SP cells, compared with wildtype mice. They concluded that
PSMB11 plays a pivotal role in development of CD8-positive T cells.

609927	TITLE *609927 VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 37, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, A; VPS37A
;;HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA-RELATED PROTEIN 1; HCRP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The VPS37A gene encodes a subunit of the endosomal sorting complex
required for transport I (ESCRT-I) complex and also may play a role in
ubiquitination (summary by Zivony-Elboum et al., 2012).

CLONING

By positional cloning in the region of chromosome 8p21-p21 in which
deletions are frequently found in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), Xu et
al. (2003) identified a novel cDNA, which they designated HCRP1, from a
human liver cDNA library. HCRP1 encodes a deduced 397-amino acid
protein. Northern blot analysis showed ubiquitous expression of an
approximately 2-kb HCRP1 transcript, with most abundant expression in
liver. Western blot analysis showed reduced HCRP1 expression in 6 of 8
HCC tissues, but higher expression levels of HCRP1 in adjacent normal
tissues in all 8 cases. Transient transfection of GFP-HCRP1 fusion
constructs showed that HCRP1 is localized throughout the cell, but
predominantly in the nucleus.

By database analysis with the sequence of the yeast endosomal sorting
complex protein Vps37/Srn2 sequence as query, Bache et al. (2004)
identified HCRP1, which they designated VPS37A. The yeast and human
proteins share 22% sequence identity in the C terminus, and both contain
a modifier of rudimentary [mod(r)] domain.

By searching a database for sequences homologous to yeast Vps37,
Stuchell et al. (2004) identified VPS37A. VPS37A has an N-terminal
ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV) domain and a C-terminal mod(r) domain, and
both of these domains contain a coiled-coil region.

Zivony-Elboum et al. (2012) found expression of the VPS37 gene in
several human tissues, including heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver,
skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas, with lower levels of expression
in the brain and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a series of transfection experiments into HCC cell lines, Xu et
al. (2003) showed that overexpression of HCRP1 inhibits both
anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent cell growth. Conversely,
reduction of HCRP1 expression by short hairpin RNA enhanced cell growth
and increased invasive ability in HCC cell lines.

Using immunofluorescence microscopy, Bache et al. (2004) demonstrated
colocalization of HCRP1 and VPS28 (601387) on LAMP1 (153330)-positive
endosomes. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated strong
interaction of HCRP1 with TSG101 (601387) and VPS28, which are
components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport I
(ESCRT-I), and weak interaction with HRS (604375), an upstream regulator
of the ESCRT-I complex. Pull-down assays demonstrated that the
interaction between HCRP1 and TSG101 occurs through the mod(r) domain.
By size exclusion chromatography, HCRP1 cofractionated with TSG101 and
VPS28. Depletion of TSG101 by siRNA treatment resulted in reduction in
HCRP1 levels in HeLa cells. Whereas siRNA-mediated depletion of HCRP1
had no effect on either TSG101 or VPS28 levels, it strongly retarded EGF
receptor (131550) degradation.

MAPPING

Xu et al. (2003) identified the VPS37A gene within the region of
frequent loss of heterozygosity in HCC on chromosome 8p23-p21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 9 affected members of 2 consanguineous Arab Moslem families with
early-onset autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia-53 (SPG53; 614898),
Zivony-Elboum et al. (2012) identified a homozygous mutation in the
VPS37A gene (K382N; 609927.0001). The mutation was found by linkage
analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing. Although the mutant
protein was expressed at normal levels in patient cells and showed
normal interaction with TSG101, knockdown of the corresponding gene in
zebrafish caused motility defects. Zivony-Elboum et al. (2012)
postulated that the disorder may result from defects in vesicular
trafficking or ubiquitination.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zivony-Elboum et al. (2012) found that morpholino knockdown of Vps37a in
zebrafish embryos resulted in a significant loss of motility.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 53, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
VPS37A, LYS382ASN

In 9 affected members of 2 consanguineous Arab Moslem families with
autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia-53 (SPG53; 614898), Zivony-Elboum
et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 1146A-T transition in exon 11 of
the VPS37A gene, resulting in a lys382-to-asn (K382N) substitution at a
highly conserved residue in the C terminus. The mutation was found by
linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing. Haplotype
analysis indicated a founder effect. The mutation was not found in
several large databases or in 428 matched control chromosomes, but was
found in the heterozygous state in 3 of 50 residents of the same
village, again indicating a founder effect. Patient cells showed normal
levels of mutant VPS37A mRNA and protein, and the mutant protein showed
normal interaction with TSG101 (601387), suggesting that the mutation
does not destabilize the endosomal sorting complex required for
transport I (ESCRT-I).

603542	TITLE *603542 SMALL NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN POLYPEPTIDE G; SNRPG
DESCRIPTION The 4 major small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) share 8
proteins which form the snRNP structural core. See SNRPF (603541). One
common protein, G (SNRPG), migrates as a doublet of approximately 9 kD
by high-TEMED SDS-PAGE. By performing RACE on a HeLa cell cDNA library
using primers based on the partial protein sequence of SNRPG, Hermann et
al. (1995) cloned SNRPG cDNAs. The predicted 76-amino acid protein
contains 34% hydrophobic residues, most of which are located in the
C-terminal half. The authors found that G protein translated in vitro
from a single SNRPG mRNA also migrated as a doublet by high-TEMED
SDS-PAGE. They suggested that the 2 bands represent conformational
isomers of the same protein. Northern blot analysis revealed that the
SNRPG gene is expressed as an approximately 0.5-kb mRNA in HeLa cells.

;;CLATHRIN-ASSOCIATED/ASSEMBLY/ADAPTOR PROTEIN, SMALL 1-LIKE;;
CLATHRIN ADAPTOR COMPLEX AP1, SIGMA-1B SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Clathrin and its associated heterotetrameric protein complexes (APs) are
the main protein components of the coat surrounding the cytoplasmic face
of coated vesicles. AP1, which is localized at the trans-Golgi network,
is composed of 2 large chains, beta-prime-adaptin (600157) and
gamma-adaptin (603533); a medium (mu) chain, AP47 (603535); and a small
(sigma) chain, AP19 (603531). Takatsu et al. (1998) identified a human
cDNA encoding sigma-1B, a protein related to mouse AP19. The predicted
157-amino acid protein shares 87% identity with human AP19. In yeast
2-hybrid assays, sigma-1B interacted with both gamma-adaptin and
gamma-2-adaptin (603534). Northern blot analysis revealed that SIGMA1B
was expressed ubiquitously in human tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tarpey et al. (2006) stated that the AP1S2 gene is composed of 5 exons.

MAPPING

Tarpey et al. (2006) identified the AP1S2 gene on chromosome Xp22 by
sequence analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a systematic sequencing screen of the coding exons of the X
chromosome in 250 families with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR),
Tarpey et al. (2006) identified 2 nonsense mutations and 1 consensus
splice site mutation in the AP1S2 gene on Xp22 in 3 families. Affected
individuals in these families, designated MRX59 (300630), showed mild to
profound mental retardation. Other features included hypotonia early in
life and delay in walking. Tarpey et al. (2006) suggested that aberrant
endocytic processing through disruption of adaptor protein complexes was
likely to result from the AP1S2 mutations identified in the 3
XLMR-affected families. Such defects may plausibly cause abnormal
synaptic development and function. AP1S2 was the first reported XLMR
gene that encodes a protein directly involved in the assembly of
endocytic vesicles.

Saillour et al. (2007) identified 2 pathogenic mutations in the AP1S2
gene (300529.0004 and 300529.0005, respectively) in affected members of
2 unrelated families with X-linked mental retardation.

Tarpey et al. (2009) sequenced the coding exons of the X chromosome in
208 families with X-linked mental retardation. They identified 3
mutations in the AP1S2 gene in 3 families.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED 59
AP1S2, GLN36TER

In a family described by Turner et al. (2003) with an X-linked recessive
form of mental retardation (MRX59; 300630) in 10 males in 4 generations,
Tarpey et al. (2006) demonstrated a nonsense mutation, gln36 to ter
(Q36X), that arose from a 106C-T transition in exon 2 of the AP1S2 gene.

.0002
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED 59
AP1S2, ARG52TER

In the family with X-linked mental retardation (MRX59; 300630) studied
by Carpenter et al. (1999), Tarpey et al. (2006) found that affected
members had an arg52-to-ter (R52X) mutation in the AP1S2 gene, resulting
from a 154C-T transition in exon 2.

.0003
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED 59
AP1S2, 4-BP DEL, NT180

In a family with 4 males with X-linked mental retardation (MRX59;
300630) in 2 generations, Tarpey et al. (2006) found in affected members
a 4-bp deletion in the AP1S2 gene, preceding the splice acceptor site of
exon 3 that resulted in the replacement of the invariant A at position
-2 with a T (180-5del4). The mutation was expected to cause skipping of
exon 3, which would then introduce a translational frameshift, resulting
in the inclusion of 3 novel amino acids, with termination at codon 64.

.0004
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED 59
AP1S2, IVS3DS, G-A, +5

In affected members of a French family with MRX59 (300630), Saillour et
al. (2007) identified a G-to-A transition in intron 3 of the AP1S2 gene
(IVS3AS+5G-A), resulting in the skipping of exon 3 and premature
truncation of the protein.

.0005
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED 59
AP1S2, GLN66TER

In affected members of a family with X-linked mental retardation
(300630) originally reported by Fried (1972), Saillour et al. (2007)
identified a 226G-T transversion in exon 3 of the AP1S2 gene, resulting
in a gln66-to-ter (Q66X) substitution. The mutation was not identified
in more than 160 normal X chromosomes.

605276	TITLE *605276 APOPTOSIS-ASSOCIATED TYROSINE KINASE; AATK
;;AATYK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomly selecting cDNA clones from size-fractionated human brain
cDNA libraries, Ishikawa et al. (1998) identified a full-length cDNA
clone, which they called KIAA0641, encoding a protein with significant
homology to the mouse Aatyk protein identified by Gaozza et al. (1997).
The deduced human AATK protein contains 1,207 amino acids and has an
observed molecular mass greater than 100 kD. By RT-PCR, Ishikawa et al.
(1998) detected expression of AATK in brain, lung, kidney, and pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

From studies of the mouse Aatyk gene, Gaozza et al. (1997) hypothesized
that Aatyk is a necessary prerequisite for the induction of growth
arrest and/or apoptosis of myeloid precursor cells. They found that
expression of Aatyk is dramatically upregulated during apoptotic death
of 32D bone marrow-derived cells during IL3 (147740) deprivation as well
as during GCSF (138970)-induced terminal differentiation of 32D cells.
Additionally, the expression of Aatyk is blocked in v-abl or bcr-abl
transformed myeloid cells, which are unable to apoptose when deprived of
IL3.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the AATK
gene to chromosome 17. By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, Seki et
al. (1999) refined the localization to 17q25.3

605125	TITLE *605125 GABA-A RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; GABARAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Type-A receptors for the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)
(see 137160) are ligand-gated chloride channels that mediate inhibitory
neurotransmission. By performing a yeast 2-hybrid screen on a fetal
brain cDNA library using the intracellular loop of the GABA-A receptor
gamma-2S subunit (GABRG2; 137164) as bait, followed by screening an
adult brain cDNA library, Wang et al. (1999) identified a cDNA encoding
GABARAP. Sequence analysis predicted that the 117-amino acid, 13.9-kD
GABARAP protein contains a basic N terminus and an acidic C terminus,
with an overall pI of 9.6. Northern blot analysis detected a 0.9-kb
GABARAP transcript in all tissues tested, namely heart, brain, placenta,
lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas. Western blot
analysis also detected GABARAP expression in all tissues tested,
suggesting that GABARAP is also involved in biologic events other than
interaction with GABA-A receptors.

MAPPING

Komoike et al. (2010) noted that the GABARAP gene maps to chromosome
17p13.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Binding analysis by Wang et al. (1999) showed that the N-terminal 21
amino acids of GABARAP formed an alpha helix that interacted with
tubulin (see TUBA1; 191110). Immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemical
analysis in rat brain tissues demonstrated association and
colocalization of GABARAP and GABA-A receptors.

Apg8 is a ubiquitin-like protein involved in autophagy in yeast. A
cysteine protease, Apg4, cleaves Apg8 to create a C-terminal glycine
required for ubiquitin-like modification reactions. There are at least 4
mammalian Apg8 homologs: GATE16 (GABARAPL2; 607452), GABARAP, MAP1LC3
(see 601242), and APG8L (GABARAPL1; 607420). Hemelaar et al. (2003)
found that mouse Atg4b (611338) acted on the C termini of these 4 Atg8
homologs, and that the reaction required the active-site cysteine of
Atg4b. Although the amino acid sequences of these Apg8 homologs differ
from one another by as much as 71%, their affinities for Atg4b were
roughly comparable in competition experiments.

Using coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analyses, Lee et al.
(2005) identified DDX47 (615428) as a binding partner of GABARAP in
human 2774 and SKOV-3 ovarian tumor cell lysates. Yeast 2-hybrid
analysis confirmed the interaction. Overexpression of either DDX47 or
GABARAP alone had no effect on proliferation of SKOV-3 cells; however,
their coexpression inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis.

Behrends et al. (2010) reported a proteomic analysis of the autophagy
interaction network (AIN) in human cells under conditions of ongoing
(basal) autophagy, revealing a network of 751 interactions among 409
candidate interacting proteins with extensive connectivity among
subnetworks. Many new AIN components have roles in vesicle trafficking,
protein or lipid phosphorylation, and protein ubiquitination, and affect
autophagosome number or flux when depleted by RNA interference. The 6
human orthologs of yeast autophagy-8 (ATG8), MAP1LC3A, MAP1LC3B
(609604), MAP1LC3C (609605), GABARAP, GABARAPL1, and GABARAPL2, interact
with a cohort of 67 proteins, with extensive binding partner overlap
between family members, and frequent involvement of a conserved surface
on ATG8 proteins known to interact with LC3-interacting regions in
partner proteins. Behrends et al. (2010) concluded that their studies
provided a global view of the mammalian autophagy interaction landscape
and a resource for mechanistic analysis of this critical protein
homeostasis pathway.

ANIMAL MODEL

Komoike et al. (2010) found that Gabarap was expressed in the
telencephalon, hindbrain, and rhombomere of zebrafish during development
and later expressed in other brain regions. Knockdown of Gabarap
resulted in dwarfism of the entire zebrafish body, as well as a severely
hypoplastic head and mandible. The findings suggested that the Gabarap
gene plays a role in brain development in zebrafish.

KINESIN-LIKE DNA-BINDING PROTEIN; KID;;
ORIGIN OF PLASMID DNA REPLICATION-BINDING PROTEIN; OBP;;
ORIP-BINDING PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The forces required for microtubule-based movements are generated by
microtubule-associated motor proteins that include cytoplasmic dynein
and kinesin. See KNSL1 (148760). Some members of the kinesin family,
such as the Drosophila NOD protein, appear to be involved in spindle
formation and function, including chromosome segregation. Tokai et al.
(1996) isolated cDNAs encoding a novel member of the kinesin family. The
predicted 665-amino acid protein was designated KID (kinesin-like
DNA-binding protein). The N-terminal region of KID shares greater than
35% sequence homology with the motor domains of other kinesins. The
C-terminal domain has limited but significant homology to NOD. KID also
contains a putative nuclear localization signal. Northern blot analysis
revealed that the 2.3-kb KID mRNA was expressed in all cancer cell lines
tested and in various somatic tissues. In cancer cells, other faint
bands were also detected.

Zhang and Nonoyama (1994) identified partial cDNAs encoding 2 cellular
proteins that bind to the origin of plasmid DNA replication (oriP) of
Epstein-Barr virus. The 2 proteins, designated OBP1 (oriP-binding
protein 1) and OBP2, appeared to result from differentially spliced
transcripts derived from a single gene.

Using RT-PCR in C57B mice, Min et al. (2011) detected expression of
Kif22 mRNA in bone, cartilage, liver, ovary, small intestine, and
spleen. KIF22 mRNA was detected in bone, cartilage, joint capsule,
ligament, skin, and primary cultured chondrocytes harvested from human
donors.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Song et al. (1998) mapped the
KNSL4 gene to 16p11.2, within 1.2 kb of the MAZ (600999) gene.

NOMENCLATURE

Lawrence et al. (2004) presented a standardized kinesin nomenclature
based on 14 family designations. Under this system, KIF22 belongs to the
kinesin-10 family.

GENE FUNCTION

Tokai et al. (1996) demonstrated that KID binds DNA and interacts with
microtubules. The ATP/GTPase activity of KID was stimulated by
microtubules. Immunofluorescence studies showed that KID colocalizes
with mitotic chromosomes and that it is enriched in the kinetochore at
anaphase. The authors concluded that KID may play a role in regulating
the movement of chromosomes along microtubules during mitosis.

At anaphase, the linkage between sister chromatids is dissolved and the
separated sisters move toward opposite poles of the spindle. Funabiki
and Murray (2000) developed a method to purify metaphase and anaphase
chromosomes from frog egg extracts and identified proteins that leave
chromosomes at anaphase using a novel form of expression screening. This
approach identified Xkid, a Xenopus homolog of human KID, as a protein
that is degraded in anaphase by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.
Immunodepleting Xkid from egg extracts prevented normal chromosome
alignment on the metaphase spindle. Adding a mild excess of wildtype or
nondegradable Xkid to egg extracts prevented the separated chromosomes
from moving toward the poles. Funabiki and Murray (2000) proposed that
Xkid provides the metaphase force that pushes chromosome arms toward the
equator of the spindle and that its destruction is needed for anaphase
chromosome movement. Similarly, Antonio et al. (2000) showed that Xkid
plays an essential role in metaphase chromosome alignment and in its
maintenance. They proposed that Xkid is responsible for the polar
ejection forces acting on chromosome arms. Their results showed that
these forces are essential to ensure that kinetochores and chromosome
arms align on a narrow equatorial plate during metaphase, a prerequisite
for proper chromosome segregation.

Perez et al. (2002) found that germinal vesicle breakdown and spindle
assembly occurred normally at meiosis I in the absence of Xkid. Instead
of proceeding to meiosis II, however, Xkid-depleted oocytes could not
reactivate Cdc2 (116940) and cyclin B (123836), and they entered an
interphase-like state and underwent DNA replication. Expression of an
Xkid mutant lacking the DNA-binding domain allowed the depleted oocytes
to complete meiotic maturation. Perez et al. (2002) concluded that Xkid
has a role in the meiotic cell cycle that is independent from its role
in metaphase chromosome alignment.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a Korean family segregating autosomal dominant
spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia and joint laxity of the Hall, or
leptodactylic, type (SEMDJL2; 603546) and in 4 unrelated Korean
patients, Min et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for missense
mutations in the KIF22 gene (603213.0001-603213.0003).

Boyden et al. (2011) sequenced exon 4 of the KIF22 gene in 32 patients
with SEMDJL2, including 20 patients from 8 families, and identified
heterozygosity for missense mutations (603213.0002, 603213.0003, or
603213.0004) in all 32 patients. The mutations, which involve highly
conserved residues within the KIF22 motor domain near an ATP-binding
site, were not found in unaffected relatives or in 480 controls of
European descent.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPONDYLOEPIMETAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITH JOINT LAXITY, TYPE 2
KIF22, PRO148SER

In a Korean mother, daughter, and son with spondyloepimetaphyseal
dysplasia with joint laxity type 2 (SEMDJL2; 603546), previously
reported by Kim et al. (2009), Min et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a 442C-T transition in exon 4 of the KIF22 gene,
resulting in a pro148-to-ser (P148S) substitution that was predicted to
interfere with ATP binding. The mutation was not found in unaffected
family members or in 1,010 control chromosomes.

.0002
SPONDYLOEPIMETAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITH JOINT LAXITY, TYPE 2
KIF22, PRO148LEU

In 2 unrelated Korean girls with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia with
joint laxity type 2 (SEMDJL2; 603546), 1 aged 4 years and 1, who was
previously reported by Kim et al. (2009) ('patient 6'), aged 13 years,
Min et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a 443C-T transition in
exon 4 of the KIF22 gene, resulting in a pro148-to-leu (P148L)
substitution that was predicted to interfere with ATP binding. The
mutation was not found in unaffected family members or in 1,010 control
chromosomes.

In 4 affected members of an Italian family and 2 affected members of a
UK family with SEMDJL2, as well as 5 sporadic patients from the US,
Brazil, Germany, Japan, and Italy, respectively, Boyden et al. (2011)
identified heterozygosity for the P148L mutation in the KIF22 gene. The
mutation segregated with disease in each family, and was not found in
480 controls of European descent.

.0003
SPONDYLOEPIMETAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITH JOINT LAXITY, TYPE 2
KIF22, ARG149GLN

In a 4-year-old Korean boy with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia with
joint laxity type 2 (SEMDJL2; 603546) and an unrelated 12-year-old
Korean girl with SEMDJL2, who was previously reported by Kim et al.
(2009) ('patient 4'), Min et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a
446G-A transition in exon 4 of the KIF22 gene, resulting in an
arg149-to-gln (R149Q) substitution that was predicted to interfere with
ATP binding. The mutation was not found in unaffected family members or
in 1,010 control chromosomes.

In 14 affected individuals from 6 families with SEMDJL2, from the US,
UK, Italy, Japan, and Belgium, as well as 6 sporadic patients from the
US, UK, France, Germany, Greece, and Lebanon, Boyden et al. (2011)
identified heterozygosity for the R149Q mutation in the KIF22 gene. The
mutation segregated with disease in each family and was not found in 480
controls of European descent.

.0004
SPONDYLOEPIMETAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITH JOINT LAXITY, TYPE 2
KIF22, ARG149LEU

In a sporadic patient from the United States with SEMDJL2 (603546),
Boyden et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a de novo 446G-T
transversion in exon 4 of the KIF22 gene, resulting in an arg149-to-leu
(R149L) substitution at a highly conserved residue near an ATP binding
site within the motor domain. The mutation was not found in the
unaffected parents or in 480 controls of European descent.

605169	TITLE *605169 E74-LIKE FACTOR 5; ELF5
;;EPITHELIUM-SPECIFIC ETS FACTOR 2; ESE2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the ETS family of transcription factors (see 164720) have
been implicated in control of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. See
Sharrocks et al. (1997) for further discussion of the ETS family.

CLONING

Oettgen et al. (1999) isolated a novel epithelium-specific ETS gene,
ESE2, by screening a human cDNA database for sequences showing homology
to ETS family members. Two isoforms of ESE2 were identified, differing
at the amino terminus. ESE2a encodes a predicted protein of 265 amino
acids with molecular weight 31.3 kD. ESE2b encodes a protein of 255
amino acids with molecular weight 30.1 kD. ESE2a has a 10-amino acid
extension at its amino terminus as compared to ESE2b. ESE2 has several
tyrosine kinase, casein kinase II (see 115440), and protein kinase C
(see 176960) consensus phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis of
poly(A+) RNA identified an ESE2 transcript between 2.4 and 2.6 kb in
length. Expression was highest in kidney and prostate, both of which
have high epithelial cell content. Further analysis by dot blot
confirmed expression in epithelial cell-rich tissues, including salivary
gland, mammary gland, fetal kidney, and trachea. RT-PCR using
isoform-specific PCR primers showed differential expression of ESE2a and
2b. Kidney expressed only ESE2a, while prostate expressed both isoforms,
with levels of ESE2b being higher. ESE2 expression was upregulated
during keratinocyte differentiation, similar to that of ESE1, but
occurred at a later stage. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays,
ESE2a did not demonstrate specific binding to a Drosophila E74 ETS
binding site. A truncated version of ESE2a lacking the first 42 amino
acids did bind this site specifically. The truncated ESE2a also bound to
the regulatory regions of several glandular epithelium-specific genes.

Zhou et al. (1998) isolated a human ELF5 cDNA from a human lung cDNA
library. By screening several cancer cell lines for expression, the
authors observed ELF5/ESE2 mRNA in a progesterone-sensitive ductal
breast carcinoma cell line only. Southern blot analysis showed evidence
of loss of heterozygosity in the lung carcinoma cell lines NCI-H358 and
NCI-H441, and rearrangement of the gene in 2 other lung carcinoma cell
lines, SK-LU-1 and NCI-H661.

GENE FUNCTION

Hemberger et al. (2010) showed that ELF5 is expressed in the human
placenta in villous cytotrophoblast cells but not in post-mitotic
syncytiotrophoblast and invasive extravillous cytotrophoblast cells.
ELF5 establishes a circuit of mutually interacting transcription factors
with CDX2 (600297) and EOMES (604615), and the highly proliferative
ELF5+/CDX2+ double-positive subset of cytotrophoblast cells demarcates a
putative trophoblast stem cell compartment in the early human placenta.
In contrast to placental trophoblast, however, ELF5 is hypermethylated
and largely repressed in human embryonic stem cells and derived
trophoblast cell lines, as well as in induced pluripotent stem cells and
murine epiblast stem cells. The authors concluded that these cells
exhibit an embryonic lineage-specific epigenetic signature and do not
undergo an epigenetic reprogramming to reflect the trophoblast lineage
at key loci such as ELF5.

MAPPING

By PCR using gene-specific primers and the Genebridge 4 radiation hybrid
DNA panel, Zhou et al. (1998) mapped the ELF5/ESE2 gene to chromosome
11p15-p13, a region of the genome that frequently undergoes loss of
heterozygosity in several types of cancer.

ANIMAL MODEL

Oakes et al. (2008) stated that Elf5 knockout in mice is embryonic
lethal due to failure of placenta development and that Elf5
heterozygotes show defective mammary gland development and reduced milk
secretion during pregnancy. They showed that Elf5 is essential for
normal alveolar development and lactation due to regulation of Cd61
(ITGB3; 173470)-positive progenitor cells. Oakes et al. (2008) also
stated that Elf5 can transactivate the whey acidic protein (WFDC5;
605161) promoter, a component of milk. They concluded that Elf5
specifies the differentiation of Cd61-positive progenitors to establish
the secretory alveolar lineage during pregnancy.

608873	TITLE *608873 SEMAPHORIN 6B; SEMA6B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a breast tumor EST database for sequences similar to rat
and mouse Sema6b, followed by RT-PCR of a breast tumor cDNA library,
Correa et al. (2001) cloned SEMA6B. The deduced protein contains 517
amino acids. By database analysis, they identified 2 additional SEMA6B
splice variants that encode deduced proteins of 687 and 888 amino acids
that differ in their C-terminal halves. These larger proteins contain a
putative transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain. Northern blot
analysis detected a 4.5-kb transcript expressed at higher levels in
brain and heart and at lower levels in spleen, placenta, and lung.
Expression was also detected in 2 human glioblastoma cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Correa et al. (2001) found that all-trans retinoic acid downregulated
expression of SEMA6B in 2 human glioblastoma cell lines.

Collet et al. (2004) found that PPARA (170998) agonists downregulated
expression of SEMA6B in glioblastoma cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Correa et al. (2001) determined that the SEMA6B gene contains 17 exons.
Collet et al. (2004) identified a PPAR-binding site in the upstream
sequence.

MAPPING

By analyzing a human/hamster hybrid cell line, Correa et al. (2001)
mapped the SEMA6B gene to chromosome 19.

609509	TITLE *609509 INTERLEUKIN 31; IL31
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IL31, which is made principally by activated Th2-type T cells, interacts
with a heterodimeric receptor consisting of IL31RA (609510) and OSMR
(601743) that is constitutively expressed on epithelial cells and
keratinocytes. IL31 may be involved in the promotion of allergic skin
disorders and in regulating other allergic diseases, such as asthma
(Dillon et al., 2004).

CLONING

Dillon et al. (2004) isolated IL31 from an activated T-cell cDNA library
based on its ability to stimulate proliferation of cells bearing IL31RA
and OSMR when translated. The predicted 164-amino acid IL31 precursor
protein produces a 141-amino acid mature protein that shares 31%
identity with the mature mouse protein. Quantitative real-time PCR
detected low expression of IL31 in testis, bone marrow, skeletal muscle,
kidney, colon, thymus, small intestine, and trachea. Among lymphoid and
myeloid cell subsets, IL31 was expressed in activated CD4
(186940)-positive T lymphocytes and at lower levels in CD8 (see
186910)-positive T cells, but not in natural killer cells, monocytes, or
resting B cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using flow cytometric analysis, Dillon et al. (2004) found that IL31
activated STAT1 (600555), STAT3 (102582), and STAT5 (601511), but not
STAT6 (601512).

Ip et al. (2007) found that stimulation of a bronchial epithelial cell
line with IL31 resulted in dose- and time-dependent upregulation of EGF
(131530), VEGF (192240), and CCL2 (158105). Combination of IL31 with
either IL4 (147780) or IL13 (147683) further enhanced CCL2 production.
IL31 also activated p38 MAPK (MAPK14; 600289), ERK (e.g., MAPK1;
176948), and JNK (MAPK8; 601158), and inhibition of these signal
transduction molecules differentially inhibited production of EGF, VEGF,
and CCL2. Ip et al. (2007) concluded that MAP kinase activation can be
crucial for IL31-mediated activation of bronchial epithelial cells and
suggested that IL31 may have a role in bronchial inflammation.

MAPPING

Dillon et al. (2004) stated that the IL31 gene maps to chromosome
12q24.31 and the mouse gene maps to a syntenic region on chromosome 5.

ANIMAL MODEL

Dillon et al. (2004) observed alopecia, severe pruritus, skin
thickening, and conjunctivitis, but no internal organ changes, in
transgenic mice overexpressing mouse Il31. Microscopic analysis of
lesional skin revealed several hallmarks of human atopic dermatitis.
However, the alopecia and pruritus developed in an IgE-independent
manner, suggestive of nonatopic dermatitis. Treatment of Rag1 (179615)
-/- mice with exogenous Il31 demonstrated that the alopecia, but not the
pruritus, was lymphocyte dependent. Dillon et al. (2004) proposed that
IL31 is involved in promoting dermatitis in allergic and nonallergic
diseases.
