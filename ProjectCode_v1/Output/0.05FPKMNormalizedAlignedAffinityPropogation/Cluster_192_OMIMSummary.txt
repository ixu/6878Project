DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Nef protein, Fukushi et al.
(1999) isolated TNIP1, which they designated NAF1, from an activated
leukocyte cDNA library. They obtained full-length NAF1 cDNAs by 5-prime
and 3-prime RACE. Fukushi et al. (1999) identified 2 alternatively
spliced isoforms of NAF1, NAF1-alpha and NAF1-beta, that differ only in
their C-terminal amino acids. NAF1-alpha contains 636 amino acids, and
NAF1-beta contains 640 amino acids. Both isoforms have 4 coiled-coil
domains and a proline-rich C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected a
2.8-kb transcript in all tissues tested, with strong expression in
peripheral blood lymphocytes, spleen, and skeletal muscle, and weak
expression in brain. NAF mRNA was also detected in various human
hematopoietic cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Fukushi et al. (1999) determined that the region of NAF1 that interacts
with the HIV-1 Nef protein is located within amino acids 94 to 412.
Overexpression of NAF1 increased cell surface expression of CD4 (186940)
in a reporter cell system, and cotransfection with Nef suppressed
NAF1-induced augmentation of CD4 expression.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, in vitro pull-down assays, and in vivo
immunoprecipitations, Zhang et al. (2002) determined that NAF1-alpha
interacts directly with ERK2 (176948). EGF (131530) treatment of
NAF1-alpha-transfected human osteosarcoma cells resulted in the
phosphorylation of NAF1-alpha by the EGF/MEK (176872)/ERK2 signal
transduction pathway. Overexpression of NAF1-alpha suppressed ERK2
nuclear translocation following activation and inhibited the
ERK2-dependent transactivation of ELK1 (311040) in a reporter assay.
Zhang et al. (2002) concluded that NAF1 is an attenuator of activated
ERK2 signaling.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fukushi et al. (1999) determined that the NAF1 gene contains 18 exons.
Exon 1 is untranslated.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Fukushi et al. (1999) mapped the NAF1 gene
to chromosome 5q32-q33.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a murine model of allergen-induced asthma, El Bakkouri et al.
(2005) showed that delivery of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see
164011) inhibitory protein Abin1 to the lung epithelium resulted in a
significant reduction of allergen-induced eosinophil infiltration into
the lungs. This reduction was associated with an Abin1-induced decrease
in allergen-specific IgE serum levels and a reduction of eotaxin (CCL11;
601156), Il4 (147780), and Il1b (147720) in bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid. El Bakkouri et al. (2005) concluded that NFKB plays a critical
role in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation and proposed that
inhibiting NFKB could be useful in asthma therapy.

Oshima et al. (2009) showed that mice deficient for Abin1 died during
embryogenesis with fetal liver apoptosis, anemia, and hypoplasia.
Abin1-deficient cells were hypersensitive to tumor necrosis factor (TNF;
191160)-induced programmed cell death, and Tnf deficiency rescued
Abin1-deficient embryos. ABIN1 inhibits caspase-8 (CASP8; 601763)
recruitment to FADD (602457) in TNF-induced signaling complexes,
preventing CASP8 cleavage and programmed cell death. Moreover, ABIN1
directly binds polyubiquitin chains, and this ubiquitin-sensing activity
is required for ABIN1's antiapoptotic activity. Oshima et al. (2009)
concluded that their studies provided insights into how ubiquitination
and ubiquitin-sensing proteins regulate cellular and organismal
survival.

;;CORE 1 BETA-3-GALACTOSYLTRANSFERASE-SPECIFIC MOLECULAR CHAPERONE;;
COSMC;;
C1GALT2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

C1GALT1C1 is a molecular chaperone required for expression of active
T-synthase (CIGALT1; 610555), the only enzyme that galactosylates the Tn
antigen (GalNAc-alpha-1-ser/thr-R) to form the core-1 O-glycan T antigen
(Gal-beta-1-3-GalNAc-alpha-1-ser/thr) during mucin-type O-glycan
biosynthesis (Wang et al., 2010).

CLONING

By database analysis with the C1GALT1 (610555) sequence as query, Kudo
et al. (2002) identified C1GALT1C1 and subsequently cloned a full-length
C1GALT1C1 cDNA by RT-PCR and screening of a Colo205 cDNA library.
C1GALT1C1 encodes a deduced 318-amino acid type II membrane protein
containing a 10-residue cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, and a
288-residue catalytic domain. C1GALT1C1 and C1GALT1 share conservation
of 7 cysteine residues in the catalytic domain, although overall amino
acid homology within this domain is only 26%. Quantitative RT-PCR
analysis showed ubiquitous C1GALT1C1 expression, with abundant
expression in salivary gland, kidney, stomach, small intestine, and
testis.

While performing peptide sequencing on C1GALT1, Ju and Cummings (2002)
identified an associated protein, which sequence analysis and cloning
identified as C1GALT1C1. Ju and Cummings (2002) reported that C1GALT1C1
contains an N-glycosylation sequence and that the mature form of
C1GALT1C1 retains the N-terminal methionine residue.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a human colorectal cell line (LSC cells) stably transfected with
C1GALT1C1, Kudo et al. (2002) demonstrated that C1GALT1C1 contains
beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase activity. Sequencing of RT-PCR products
of C1GALT1C1 in LSC and Jurkat cells, both of which lack core 1 synthase
activity, revealed that the ORF of C1GALT1C1 is mutated in both cell
lines, resulting in a truncated C1GALT1C1 protein.

Using transfection assays on insect cells, Ju and Cummings (2002) showed
that coexpression of C1GALT1C1 is required for C1GALT1 function.
Transfection assays of 293T cells showed that overexpression of active
C1GALT1 also requires overexpression of C1GALT1C1. Nickel-affinity
binding of His-tagged recombinant C1GALT1C1 demonstrated that C1GALT1C1
directly associates with C1GALT1. Assays on transfected Jurkat cells
showed that the endogenous C1GALT1 mutation in Jurkat cells is
complemented by C1GALT1C1, restoring C1GALT1 function and biosynthesis
of core 1 O-glycans, and generating active, soluble, and secreted
C1GALT1 protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kudo et al. (2002) demonstrated that C1GALT1C1 contains at least 2
exons, with the ORF completely contained within exon 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ju and Cummings (2005) showed that Tn polyagglutination syndrome (TNPS;
300622) is associated with somatic mutations in COSMC, which encodes a
molecular chaperone that is required for the proper folding and hence
full activity of T synthase (C1GALT1; 610555). One individual with TNPS
was found to carry an arg-to-ter mutation at codon 68 (300611.0001) and
an asp-to-glu mutation at position 131 (300611.0002) of COSMC genes in
whole blood cells. In the second individual, a lys-to-glu mutation at
codon 152 (300611.0003) was identified. These mutations were not found
in 25 healthy donors representing 33 alleles. In expression experiments,
Ju and Cummings (2005) showed that these mutations in COSMC cause it to
lose its chaperone function, which leads to inactivation of T synthase
and expression of the autoimmune Tn antigen on blood cells of all
lineages.

Crew et al. (2008) identified 2 different somatic mutations in the
C1GALT1C1 gene (300611.0004-300611.0005) in 2 unrelated patients with Tn
polyagglutination syndrome. Expression of the mutations in Jurkat T
lymphocytes resulted in the cells expressing the Tn antigen, indicating
loss of C1GALT1C1 function.

Schietinger et al. (2006) found that a somatic mutation in the chaperone
gene Cosmc abolished function of a glycosyltransferase, disrupting
O-glycan core 1 synthesis and creating a tumor-specific glycopeptidic
neoepitope consisting of a monosaccharide and a specific wildtype
protein sequence. This epitope induced a high affinity, highly specific,
syngeneic monoclonal antibody with antitumor activity. Schietinger et
al. (2006) concluded that the existing paradigm for tumor-specific
antigen creation (from mutant gene to mutant protein to tumor antigen)
must be expanded to include antigens generated by tumor-specific
posttranslational modifications of wildtype proteins.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Kudo et al. (2002) mapped the C1GALT1C1 gene to
chromosome Xq23.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wang et al. (2010) found that ablation of the Cosmc gene in mice was
embryonic lethal and resulted in Tn antigen expression on many different
glycoproteins in all tissues. The most obvious phenotype of Cosmc-null
embryos was hemorrhage in the brain and spinal cord. Loss of Cosmc was
associated with loss of T-synthase activity, but other
glycosyltransferases, especially those in N-glycosylation pathways, were
not affected. Mosaic mice with Cosmc deletion in a portion of cells in a
tissue or organ showed variable survival, with a range of phenotypes
that correlated with T-synthase loss and Tn expression. Wang et al.
(2010) concluded that Cosmc is a critical and specific T-synthase
chaperone.

loss of the first 12 amino acids. Expression of the mutation in Jurkat T

loss of C1GALT1C1 function.

FRUCTOALDOLASE A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13) is a glycolytic enzyme
that catalyzes the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The enzyme is
a tetramer of identical 40-kD subunits. Vertebrates have 3 aldolase
isozymes, aldolases A, B (ALDOB; 612724), and C (ALDOC; 103870), which
are distinguished by their electrophoretic and catalytic properties. The
sequence of the aldolases around the active-site lysine is highly
conserved in evolution. Mammalian tissues express aldolase isozymes in a
well-characterized pattern. Developing embryo produces aldolase A, which
continues to be expressed in many adult tissues, sometimes at much
higher levels than in embryo. In adult muscle, aldolase A can be as much
as 5% of total cellular protein. In adult liver, kidney, and intestine,
aldolase A expression is repressed and aldolase B is produced. In brain
and other nervous tissue, aldolase A and C are expressed about equally.
In transformed liver cells, aldolase A replaces aldolase B (Rottmann et
al., 1984).

CLONING

Electrophoretic variants of fructoaldolase were reported by Charlesworth
(1972).

Sakakibara et al. (1985) cloned aldolase A from a human liver cDNA
library. The deduced protein contains 363 amino acids. RNA blot analysis
revealed a 1.6-kb ALDOA mRNA in skeletal muscle and a 1.7-kb ALDOA mRNA
in liver and placenta.

Freemont et al. (1988) presented the complete amino acid sequence of
human skeletal muscle fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, comprising 363
residues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Izzo et al. (1988) found that the ALDOA gene spans 7.5 kb and contains
12 exons. It occurs as a single copy per haploid human genome. Eight
exons containing the coding sequence were common to all mRNAs extracted
from several mammalian sources. Four additional exons were identified in
the 5-prime UTR: the first was contained in the ubiquitous mRNA, the
second in the muscle-specific mRNA, and the third and fourth in a minor
mRNA in human liver. S(1)-nuclease-protection analysis of the 5-prime
end of mRNA from cultured fibroblasts, muscle, and hepatoma cell lines
revealed 4 different transcription initiation sites. The presence of
conventional sequences for 4 eukaryotic promoters was also demonstrated.
The nucleotide similarities in the coding region and the intron-exon
organization of aldolases A, B, and C confirmed that they arose from a
common ancestral gene, with aldolase B diverging first.

MAPPING

Harris (1974) concluded that 3 loci determine aldolase. Cohen-Haguenauer
et al. (1985) assigned aldolase A to chromosome 16, whereas Kukita et
al. (1985) assigned it to chromosome 22. However, Kukita et al. (1987)
mapped the ALDOA gene to chromosome 16 by 3 different methods: molecular
hybridization to hybrid cell DNA, molecular hybridization to DNA of
sorted metaphase chromosomes, and in situ hybridization. In situ
hybridization indicated that the gene is located on the chromosome
16q22-q24 band. Serero et al. (1988) also assigned the aldolase A gene
to chromosome 16 by Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA with a
cDNA probe. Aldolase A pseudogenes were found on chromosomes 3 and 10.
The map location of the 3 aldolase genes and the aldolase pseudogene
(see 612724) is of considerable interest from the point of view of
chromosome evolution. The 4 genes are found on 2 pairs of
morphologically similar chromosomes, 9 and 10, and 16 and 17. These
homeologous (i.e., of similar origin) chromosome pairs may have arisen
from 1 or 2 tetraploidization events (Comings, 1972; Ohno, 1973). As
predicted by the chromosomal locations, the coding sequences of the
expressed aldolase A and C genes on chromosomes 16 and 17, respectively,
are more homologous to each other than either of them is to the
expressed aldolase B gene on chromosome 9.

Amberger (2008) mapped the ALDOA gene to chromosome 16p11.2 based on an
alignment of the ALDOA sequence (GenBank GENBANK M11560) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kishi et al. (1987) studied a patient with red cell aldolase deficiency,
or glycogen storage disease XII (GSD12; 611881), and identified a
mutation in the ALDOA gene that resulted in an asp128-to-gly (D128G;
103850.0001) substitution in the protein. The patient's enzyme from red
cells and from cultured lymphoblastoid cells was highly thermolabile,
and the enzyme expressed in E. coli was likewise thermolabile. The
parents had intermediate levels of red cell aldolase A. Southern blot
analysis of genomic DNA showed that the patient was homozygous for a
mutation that was heterozygous in both parents.

In a boy with aldolase A deficiency, Kreuder et al. (1996) identified a
homozygous germline mutation in the ALDOA gene that resulted
substitution of a negatively charged glutamic acid with a positively
charged lysine at the highly conserved residue 206 (E206L; 103850.0002).
The affected residue is highly conserved within the subunit interface
region.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE XII
ALDOA, ASP128GLY

In a patient with red cell aldolase deficiency, or glycogen storage
disease XII (GSD12; 611881), Kishi et al. (1987) identified an A-G
transversion at nucleotide 386 in the codon for the 128th amino acid,
leading to a change from aspartic acid (GAU) to glycine (GGU) (D128G) in
the aldolase protein. The patient's enzyme from red cells and from
cultured lymphoblastoid cells was highly thermolabile, and the enzyme
expressed in E. coli was likewise thermolabile. Since asp128 is
conserved in aldolase A, B (612724), and C (103870) of eukaryotes,
including Drosophila, this residue likely has a crucial role in
maintaining the correct spatial structure or in performing the catalytic
function of the enzyme. The parents had intermediate levels of red cell
aldolase A. The change in the aspartic acid codon extinguished an Fok1
restriction site (GGATG to GGGTG). Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA
showed that the patient was homozygous for a mutation that was
heterozygous in both parents.

.0002
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE XII
ALDOA, GLU206LYS

Kreuder et al. (1996) described a 4 1/2-year-old boy with predominantly
myopathic symptoms of aldolase A deficiency (611881) due to substitution
of a single amino acid within the subunit interface most essential for
the tetrameric structure of the enzyme. The patient showed muscle
weakness and premature muscle fatigue. He was unable to walk for more
than 10 minutes or climb more than 20 steps at a time. Several
unexplained episodes of jaundice and anemia required blood transfusions
during the first year of life. The parents were healthy and
nonconsanguineous. The patient showed slight jaundice, diminished muscle
mass, reduced muscle tone, and proximal muscle weakness. The liver and
spleen were somewhat enlarged. Creatine kinase was markedly elevated in
the blood of this patient, and several muscle enzymes, as well as serum
bilirubin, were increased. Codon 206 of the ALDOA gene was found to have
a homozygous transition from GAG (glu) to AAG (lys) (E206K). The authors
noted that a glutamate is present in all human aldolases at position 206
of the enzyme. Both parents and a healthy brother were heterozygous for
the mutation.

CISPLATIN RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED OVEREXPRESSED PROTEIN; CROP;;
LUC7A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display of transcripts overexpressed in a
cisplatin-resistant human renal cancer cell line, followed by 5-prime
RACE, Nishii et al. (2000) cloned 2 cDNA variants of CROP. The shorter
variant encodes a deduced 432-amino acid protein. The N-terminal half
contains cystine/histidine motifs and leucine zipper-like repeats, and
the C-terminal half consists mostly of charged and polar amino acids.
The longer variant contains several nonsense codons and is not
translatable. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.5-kb transcript in
almost all tissues examined. Expression was strong in heart, brain,
pancreas, thymus, ovary, small intestine, and peripheral blood
leukocytes, and weak in lung, liver, and kidney. Western blot analysis
detected CROP at an apparent molecular mass of 58 kD in nuclear extracts
of cisplatin-resistant cells and in COS-7 cells.

Umehara et al. (2003) detected fluorescence-tagged CROP in a speckled
intranuclear distribution in transfected COS-7 cells. Mutation analysis
determined that the C-terminal 187 amino acids contain the nuclear
distribution signal.

GENE FUNCTION

Nishii et al. (2000) found that expression of a translatable CROP mRNA
was about 3 times higher in cisplatin-resistant renal cancer cells than
in cisplatin-sensitive renal cancer cells.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Umehara et al. (2003) found that CROP
interacted with SF2 (SFRS1; 600812), an arginine/serine-rich RNA
splicing protein, as well as with itself. The arginine/glutamate-rich
and arginine/serine-rich domains of CROP were necessary for both its
intranuclear speckled distribution and the protein-protein interactions.
CROP was phosphorylated by mouse Srpk1 (601939), mouse Srpk2 (602980),
and Clk1 (601951) in vitro. The subnuclear distribution of
fluorescence-labeled CROP changed following cisplatin treatment,
suggesting that cisplatin affects RNA splicing by changing the
subnuclear distribution of serine/arginine-rich proteins, including
CROP.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Consortium mapped the LUC7L3 gene to
chromosome 17 (TMAP SHGC-2641).

;;TUBB4;;

TUBULIN, BETA, CLASS IVA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Microtubules are dynamic polymeric structures consisting of heterodimers
of alpha-tubulins (see 602529) and beta-tubulins, such as TUBB4A, that
are continuously incorporated and released. Microtubules are an
essential component of the cytoskeleton that function in mitosis,
intracellular transport, neuron morphology, and ciliary and flagellar
motility (Leandro-Garcia et al., 2010).

CLONING

Hall et al. (1983) identified a beta-tubulin gene that they designated
5-beta. The 5-beta gene was expressed as a 2.6-kb transcript on Northern
blots of HeLa cell mRNA. Lee et al. (1984) reported that the 5-beta
sequence encodes a predicted 445-amino acid protein. Using Northern
analysis, they determined that 5-beta is expressed in fetal brain, but
not in cell lines derived from various other tissues. Lewis and Cowan
(1990) stated that the mouse homolog of 5-beta, M-beta-4, is expressed
specifically in brain.

Using database analysis, Leandro-Garcia et al. (2010) identified 8 major
beta-tubulins, including TUBB4A, which they called TUBB4. Quantitative
RT-PCR of 21 normal human tissues detected high TUBB4A expression in
brain and much lower expression in testis. Little to no expression was
detected in other tissues examined. TUBB4A was the major beta-tubulin
isotype in brain, where it represented 46% of all beta-tubulins.

In human brain, Hersheson et al. (2013) found highest expression of the
TUBB4A gene in the cerebellum, followed by putamen and white matter. The
thalamus showed the lowest expression of all brain regions studied.
Expression of TUBB4A in other body tissues was very low except for
moderate expression in the testes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the TUBB4A gene to chromosome 19p13.3 based on an
alignment of the TUBB4A sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC006570) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Dystonia 4

In affected members of a large multigenerational family of English and
Australian origin with autosomal dominant dystonia-4 (DYT4; 128101)
(Parker, 1985), Hersheson et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous
mutation in the TUBB4A gene (R2G; 602662.0001), resulting in an
arg2-to-gly (R2G) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
autoregulatory MREI domain. The mutation, which was found by linkage
analysis and exome sequencing, was not found in several large control
databases and segregated with the disorder in the family. Previous
site-directed mutagenesis studies by Yen et al. (1988) had shown that
mutations in the MREI domain, including R2G, abrogate the autoregulatory
capability of TUBB4A, which may affect the balance of tubulin subunits
and interfere with proper assembly. The findings suggested a role for
the cytoskeleton in dystonia pathogenesis.

- Hypomyelinating Leukodystrophy 6

In 9 unrelated patients with hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-6 (HLD6;
612438), Simons et al. (2013) identified the same de novo heterozygous
mutation in the TUBB4A gene (D249N; 602662.0001). Two sibs with the
disorder inherited the mutation from their unaffected mother, who was
found to be somatic mosaic for the mutation. The D249N mutation was
found by exome sequencing, confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and was not
found in several large control exome databases. TUBB4A is highly
expressed in neurons, and Simons et al. (2013) suggested that the
mutation may result in a dominant-negative effect on tubulin
dimerization, microtubule polymerization, or microtubule stability in
neurons with a secondary involvement of glial cells. The phenotype was
characterized primarily by onset in the first years of life of delayed
motor development or gait instability, followed by motor deterioration
and extrapyramidal signs. Six patients had cognitive decline and 2 had
mild intellectual disability, but 3 had normal cognitive development.
All patients except 1 had some type of speech delay and dysarthria.

(Parker, 1985), Hersheson et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous c.4C-G
transversion in exon 1 of the TUBB4A gene, resulting in an arg2-to-gly

MREI domain. The mutation, which was found by linkage analysis and exome

TUBB4A, ASP249ASN

In 9 unrelated patients with hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-6 (HLD6;
612438), Simons et al. (2013) identified a de novo heterozygous c.745G-A
transition in the TUBB4A gene, resulting in an asp249-to-asn (D249N)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the T7 loop, which
interacts with the GTP nucleotide bound to the N-site of the
alpha-tubulin and is important for the longitudinal interaction between
tubulins. Two sibs with the disorder inherited the mutation from their
unaffected mother, who was found to be somatic mosaic for the mutation.
The D249N mutation was found by exome sequencing, confirmed by Sanger
sequencing, and was not found in several large control exome databases.
TUBB4A is highly expressed in neurons, and Simons et al. (2013)
suggested that the mutation may result in a dominant-negative effect on
tubulin dimerization, microtubule polymerization, or microtubule

deterioration and extrapyramidal signs. Six patients had cognitive
decline, 2 had mild intellectual disability, and 3 had normal cognitive
development. All patients except 1 had some sort of speech delay and
dysarthria. Simons et al. (2013) noted that the D249N substitution has
been identified in other beta-tubulins as being pathogenic: in the Tubb1
gene (612901) in Cavalier King Charles Spaniel dogs with inherited
macrothrombocytopenia (Davis et al., 2008), and in a beta-tubulin gene
in C. elegans with loss of touch sensitivity (Savage et al., 1994).

607492	TITLE *607492 PHOSPHOFURIN ACIDIC CLUSTER SORTING PROTEIN 1; PACS1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PACS1 is a trans-Golgi-membrane traffic regulator that directs protein
cargo and several viral envelope proteins. It is upregulated during
human embryonic brain development and has low expression after birth
(summary by Schuurs-Hoeijmakers et al., 2012).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse embryo cDNA library to identify
cytosolic proteins that bind directly to the phosphorylated furin
(136950) cytosolic domain, Wan et al. (1998) identified cDNAs encoding
Pacs1. Screening of a rat brain cDNA library with the Pacs1 sequences
yielded 2 cDNAs representing splice variants. The larger variant,
Pacs1a, has 961 amino acids, and the smaller variant, Pacs1b, has 559
amino acids. Both proteins contain the 140-amino acid furin-binding
region (val115 to pro255). Northern blot analysis using
transcript-specific probes showed that both Pacs1 variants were
expressed ubiquitously, with the 4.4-kb Pacs1a transcript expressed more
than 20-fold higher than the 3.6-kb Pacs1b transcript. Wan et al. (1998)
also identified human ESTs containing PACS1 sequences.

GENE FUNCTION

Wan et al. (1998) reported that Pacs1 directs the trans-Golgi network
(TGN) localization of furin by binding to its phosphorylated cytosolic
domain. Antisense studies showed that TGN localization of furin and
mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR; 154540), but not TGN46 (603062), is
strictly dependent on Pacs1. Analyses in vitro and in vivo showed that
Pacs1 has properties of a coat protein and connects furin to components
of the clathrin-sorting machinery. Cell-free assays indicated TGN
localization of furin is directed by a Pacs1-mediated retrieval step.
Together, these findings explained a mechanism by which membrane
proteins in mammalian cells are localized to the TGN.

Blagoveshchenskaya et al. (2002) showed that the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV)-1 multifunctional early gene product Nef and cellular PACS1
combine to usurp the ARF6 (600464) endocytic pathway by a
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K; see 171833)-dependent process and
downregulate cell surface major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I
molecules to the TGN. They found that this mechanism requires the
hierarchical actions of 3 Nef motifs, the acidic cluster
glu62-glu63-glu64-glu65, the SH3 domain-binding site pro72-X-X-pro75,
and met20, in controlling PACS1-dependent sorting to the TGN, ARF6
activation, and sequestering internalized MHC class I molecules to the
TGN, respectively.

Polycystin-2 (PKD2; 173910) functions as a calcium-permeable
nonselective cation channel at the plasma membrane or ER. Kottgen et al.
(2005) found that the subcellular localization and function of
polycystin-2 were directed by PACS1 and PACS2 (610423), which recognized
an acidic cluster in the C-terminal domain of polycystin-2. Binding to
these adaptor proteins was regulated by the phosphorylation of
polycystin-2 on ser812 by casein kinase-2 (see CSNK2A1; 115440),
required for the routing of polycystin-2 between ER, Golgi, and the
plasma membrane compartments. Kottgen et al. (2005) concluded that PACS1
and PACS2 are involved in ion channel trafficking, directing acid
cluster-containing ion channels to distinct subcellular compartments.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PACS1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP RH18211). By radiation hybrid and genomic
database analysis, Simmen et al. (2005) mapped the PACS1 gene to
chromosome 11q13.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Schuurs-Hoeijmakers et al. (2012) identified a recurrent de novo
missense mutation in PACS1, an arginine-to-tryptophan substitution at
position 203 (R203W; 607492.0001), in the furin (cargo) binding region
directly adjacent to the CK2 binding motif. Schuurs-Hoeijmakers et al.
(2012) found that altered PACS1 forms cytoplasmic aggregates in vitro
with concomitant increased stability and showed impaired binding to an
isoform-specific variant of TRPV4 (605427), but not the full-length
protein. Furthermore, consistent with the human pathology, expression of
mutant PACS1 mRNA in zebrafish embryos induced craniofacial defects most
likely in a dominant-negative fashion. The phenotype was driven by
aberrant specification and migration of SOX10 (602229)-positive cranial,
but not enteric, neural crest cells.

In 2 boys with mental retardation and a strikingly similar facial
appearance (MRD17; 615009), Schuurs-Hoeijmakers et al. (2012) identified
the same de novo mutation in the PACS1 gene: a 607C-T transition
resulting in an arg-to-trp substitution at residue 203 (R203W). This
mutation was not identified in 150 alleles from the Dutch population, in
2,304 from the local variant database, or in 7,020 alleles of European
American origin from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The NRG1 gene encodes neuregulin-1, a signaling protein that mediates
cell-cell interactions and plays a critical role in the growth of organ
systems (Tan et al., 2007).

Neuregulin, also known as heregulin or NEU differentiation factor (NDF),
was first identified by Holmes et al. (1992) as a ligand for the
NEU/ERBB2 protooncogene (164870). NEU/ERBB2 is closely related to
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; 131550) but binds none of the
EGFR ligands. Splice variants of heregulin, referred to as
heregulin-betas, were also identified.

CLONING

By screening a human breast adenocarcinoma cDNA library, Holmes et al.
(1992) isolated clones corresponding to NRG1, which they called HRG. The
clones encoded deduced proteins of 640, 645, 637, and 231 amino acids,
which were designated proHRG-alpha, proHRG-beta-1, proHRG-beta-2, and
proHRG-beta-3, respectively. Holmes et al. (1992) characterized the
differences between the 4 HRGs at the amino acid level. The mature HRGs
were estimated to range in size from 228 to 241 amino acids with a
predicted molecular mass of about 26 kD. Posttranslational modification
occurring at predicted glycosylation sites likely accounts for the
observed molecular mass of 45 kD. Northern blot analysis detected mRNA
transcripts of 6.6, 2.5, and 1.8 kb in multiple human tissues, but
expression was often tissue-specific for 1 of the mRNA transcripts.

Meyer et al. (1997) noted that alternative splicing of the NRG1 gene
results in transcripts encoding 3 major isoforms with distinct domain
structures, although all contain an EGF-like domain. Type I NRG1, also
known as heregulin or NDF, contains an N-terminal immunoglobulin
(Ig)-like domain prior to the EGF-like domain, which is followed by a
specific hydrophobic stretch and a unique C-terminal domain. The
EGF-like domain in type I NRG1 can be either the alpha or beta variant,
depending on whether the transcript includes exon 7 or 8, respectively.
Type II NRG1, or glial growth factor-2 (GGF2), contains an N-terminal
signal peptide, a Kringle-like domain, and an Ig-like domain prior to
the EGF-like domain (beta variant). Type III NRG1, or sensory and motor
neuron-derived factor (SMDF), contains a unique N terminus with a
hydrophobic stretch prior to the EGF-like domain (beta variant). By in
situ hybridization of mouse embryos using probes specific for
transcripts encoding the 3 major NRG1 isoforms, Meyer et al. (1997)
found that type I Nrg1 was expressed predominantly in early mouse
embryogenesis, whereas type II and type III were first detected at
midgestation. Type I Nrg1 was expressed predominantly in neural tissue,
respiratory epithelium, and endocardium. Yolk sac and other embryonic
sites also expressed type I Nrg1. Type II Nrg1 was expressed in neural
tissues, pituitary, retinal ganglion cell layer, and skeletal muscle.
Type III Nrg1 was expressed in neural tissues, olfactory epithelium, and
retinal ganglion cell layer, with low expression in endocardium.

By RT-PCR and 5-prime RACE of adult and fetal human brain cDNA
libraries, Steinthorsdottir et al. (2004) identified 10 alternatively
spliced NRG1 transcripts. They identified an additional variant by
database analysis. The transcripts encode proteins with 6 different
N-terminal domains and variability in the spacer region downstream of
the Ig-like domain. Steinthorsdottir et al. (2004) proposed that the
proteins with the 3 novel N-terminal domains be designated types IV, V,
and VI NRG1.

Tan et al. (2007) stated that at least 15 NRG1 isoforms are generated
through alternative promoter use and splicing. They isolated a
full-length clone for NRG1 type IV from adult and fetal human brain cDNA
libraries. The deduced 590-residue protein, designated type IV-beta-1a,
has a calculated molecular mass of 66 kD. The 1.8-kb transcript contains
11 exons and yields a protein with an Ig-like domain, an EGFc domain, a
beta-1 stalk, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic a-tail,
consistent with the beta-1a NRG1 subclass. Several splice variants were
identified. NRG1 type IV was detected only in human brain and was
3.5-fold more abundant in fetal brain compared to adult brain,
suggesting a role in brain development. NRG1 type IV was not detected in
breast tumor or neuroblastoma cell lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Steinthorsdottir et al. (2004) determined that the NRG1 gene contains 21
alternatively spliced exons and spans more than 1.1 Mb. Alternative
splicing can produce at least 9 alternative promoters upstream of the
protein-coding sequences. Most of the exons are located in a 200-kb
region at the 3-prime end of the gene.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization of a tritium-labeled probe to human metaphase
spreads, Orr-Urtreger et al. (1993) localized the NDF gene to 8p21-p12.
Lee and Wood (1993) localized the HGL gene to 8p22-p11 by PCR
experiments involving human/rodent cell hybrids containing a portion of
chromosome 8. Thomas et al. (1993) excluded HRG as the site of the
mutation in Werner syndrome (277700) by demonstrating recombination in
linkage studies.

GENE FUNCTION

In mouse embryos 14.5 days postcoitum, Orr-Urtreger et al. (1993) found
that NDF expression is confined predominantly to the central and
peripheral nervous systems, including the neuroepithelium that lines the
lateral ventricles of the brain, the ventral horn of the spinal cord,
and the intestinal as well as dorsal root ganglia.

Ozaki et al. (1997) found that a neuregulin-beta isoform increased
expression of the NR2C (138254) subunit of the NMDA receptor in cultured
mouse cerebellar slices and that this upregulation also required
synaptic activity by NMDA receptors. The findings suggested that
neuregulins regulate the composition of neurotransmitter receptors in
maturing synapses in the brain.

Heregulin is also known as glial growth factor-2 (GGF2), or neuregulin.
GGF2 is a neuronal signal that promotes the proliferation and survival
of the oligodendrocyte, the myelinating cell of the central nervous
system. Cannella et al. (1998) examined the effect of recombinant human
GGF2 (rhGGF2) on clinical recovery and repair to damaged myelin in
chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in the
mouse, a major animal model for multiple sclerosis (126200). Clinically,
rhGGF2 treatment delayed signs and decreased severity of the disorder,
and resulted in statistically significant reductions in relapse rate.
The groups treated with rhGGF2 displayed central nervous system lesions
with more remyelination than did controls. This correlated with
increased mRNA expression of myelin basic protein exon 2, a marker for
remyelination, and with an increase in the central nervous system of a
regulatory cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL10; 124092), at both the RNA and
protein levels. Cannella et al. (1998) concluded that rhGGF2 treatment
may represent a novel approach to the management of multiple sclerosis.

Wolpowitz et al. (2000) stated that NRG1 is a member of a family of
structurally related glycoproteins that includes NRG2 (603818), NRG3
(605533), and NRG4 (610894). Alternative splicing of at least 15 exons
generates a minimum of 14 NRG1 isoforms. These isoforms can be
subdivided into 2 mutually exclusive categories: type I (with
cytoplasmic tail) and type II (without cytoplasmic tail) isoforms
contain an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain and are referred to as
Ig-NRGs; type III isoforms (with or without cytoplasmic tail) contain a
cysteine-rich domain (CRD) N terminal to a common epidermal growth
factor (EGF; 131530)-like sequence and are referred to as CRD-NRGs.

Fernandez et al. (2000) demonstrated that neuregulin supports the
survival of purified oligodendrocytes and aged oligodendrocyte precursor
cells but not of young oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Fernandez et al.
(2000) further showed that axons promote the survival of purified
oligodendrocytes and that this effect is inhibited if neuregulin is
neutralized. In the developing rat optic nerve, delivery of NRG
decreases both normal oligodendrocyte death and extra oligodendrocyte
death induced by nerve transection, whereas neutralization of endogenous
NRG increases the normal death. The authors suggested that NRG is an
axon-associated survival signal for developing oligodendrocytes.

Martinou et al. (1991) found that acetylcholine receptor-inducing
activity (Aria), a 42-kD glycoprotein purified on the basis of its
ability to increase the synthesis of acetylcholine receptors in chick
myotubes, increases epsilon-subunit mRNA levels up to 10-fold. Thus,
Aria appears to be responsible in a major way for the switch from gamma
subunits (100730) to epsilon subunits (100725) in the pentameric
acetylcholine receptor protein complex. Falls et al. (1993) purified and
cloned a cDNA encoding chick Aria, which is 81% identical to NRG1. They
suggested that Aria and Aria-activated tyrosine kinases are important in
the differentiation of the neuromuscular junction and perhaps
interneuronal synapses as well.

Neuregulins and their receptors, the ERBB protein tyrosine kinases, are
essential for neuronal development. Huang et al. (2000) reported that
ERBB4 (600543) is enriched in the postsynaptic density and associates
with PSD95 (602887). Heterologous expression of PSD95 enhanced NRG
activation of ERBB4 and MAP kinase (see 176948). Conversely, inhibiting
expression of PSD95 in neurons attenuated NRG-mediated activation of MAP
kinase. PSD95 formed a ternary complex with 2 molecules of ERBB4,
suggesting that PSD95 facilitates ERBB4 dimerization. Finally, NRG
suppressed induction of long-term potentiation in the hippocampal CA1
region without affecting basal synaptic transmission. Thus, NRG
signaling may be synaptic and regulated by PSD95. Huang et al. (2000)
concluded that a role of NRG signaling in the adult central nervous
system may be modulation of synaptic plasticity. Garcia et al. (2000)
also found that ERBB4 and PSD95 coimmunoprecipitated from rat forebrain
lysates and that the direct interaction was mediated through the
C-terminal end of ERBB4. Immunofluorescent studies of cultured rat
hippocampal cells showed that ERBB4 colocalized with PSD95 and NMDA
receptors at interneuronal postsynaptic regions. The findings suggested
that certain ERBB receptors physically interact with membrane-associated
guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) in coupling neurotransmitter receptors to
intracellular signaling pathways, which may be important in
activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.

ERBB4 is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates cell
proliferation and differentiation. After binding its ligand heregulin or
activation of protein kinase C (see 176960) by TPA, the ERBB4-ectodomain
is cleaved by a metalloprotease. Ni et al. (2001) reported a subsequent
cleavage by gamma-secretase that releases the ERBB4 intracellular domain
from the membrane and facilitates its translocation to the nucleus.
Gamma-secretase cleavage was prevented by chemical inhibitors or a
dominant-negative presenilin (104311). Inhibition of gamma-secretase
also prevented growth inhibition by heregulin. Ni et al. (2001)
concluded that gamma-secretase cleavage of ERBB4 may represent another
mechanism for receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling.

Buonanno and Fischbach (2001) provided a detailed review of neuregulins
and ERBB receptor signaling pathways in the nervous system.

Vermeer et al. (2003) showed that in differentiated human airway
epithelia, heregulin-alpha is present exclusively in the apical membrane
and the overlying airway surface liquid, physically separated from ERBB2
(164870), ERBB3 (190151), and ERBB4, which segregate to the basolateral
membrane. This physical arrangement creates a ligand-receptor pair
poised for activation whenever epithelial integrity is disrupted.
Indeed, immediately following a mechanical injury, heregulin-alpha
activates ERBB2 in cells at the edge of the wound, and this process
hastens restoration of epithelial integrity. Likewise, when epithelial
cells are not separated into apical and basolateral membranes
(polarized), or when tight junctions between adjacent cells are opened,
heregulin-alpha activates its receptor. This mechanism of
ligand-receptor segregation on either side of epithelial tight junctions
may be vital for rapid restoration of integrity following injury, and
hence critical for survival. This model also suggests a mechanism for
abnormal receptor activation in diseases with increased epithelial
permeability.

Michailov et al. (2004) used mutant and transgenic mice to show that
axonal Nrg1 signals information about axon size to Schwann cells.
Reduced Nrg1 expression caused hypomyelination and reduced nerve
conduction velocity. Neuronal overexpression of Nrg1 induced
hypermyelination and demonstrated that Nrg1 type III is the responsible
isoform. Michailov et al. (2004) suggested a model by which
myelin-forming Schwann cells integrate axonal Nrg1 signals as a
biochemical measure of axon size.

Bao et al. (2004) found that sound-induced synaptic activity in the
mouse cochlea increased the level of nuclear Nrg-ICD (intracellular
domain) and upregulated PSD95 in postsynaptic spiral ganglion neurons.
Nrg-ICD enhanced the transcriptional activity of the PSD95 promoter by
binding to Eos (606239), a zinc finger transcription factor. The
findings identified a molecular basis for activity-dependent synaptic
plasticity.

Flames et al. (2004) found that specific mouse Nrg1 isoforms had
different effects on the adhesion and migration of primary mouse medial
ganglionic eminence-derived neurons. They showed that the membrane-bound
type III isoform acted as a substrate for cell adhesion, while the
soluble and diffusible types I and II isoforms were chemoattractive and
induced cell migration.

Lemmens et al. (2004) found that the alpha and beta isoforms of NRG1
induced a negative inotropic effect in isolated rabbit papillary muscles
and a rightward shift in the dose-response curve to isoproterenol. Both
effects were attenuated by a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor. In
cultured rat cardiomyocytes, NRG1-beta enhanced nitrite production and
resulted in phosphorylation of endothelial NOS (NOS3; 163729) and the
serine/threonine kinase Akt (see AKT1; 164730). Lemmens et al. (2004)
concluded that NRG1 has negative inotropic effects and activates
endothelial NOS in cardiomyocytes.

Lopez-Bendito et al. (2006) found that development of the mouse
thalamocortical projection, one of the most prominent tracts in
forebrain, depended on early tangential migration of GABAergic neurons
from the lateral to the medial ganglionic eminence. This migration was
essential to form a permissive corridor for thalamocortical axons (TCAs)
to navigate through the telencephalon. Erbb4 and 2 different Nrg1
isoforms, CRD-Nrg1 and Ig-Nrg1, controlled the guidance of TCAs in the
telencephalon.

Ky et al. (2009) quantified serum NRG1-beta in 899 patients with
systolic heart failure representing a broad spectrum of disease and
found that circulating NRG1-beta was significantly elevated in patients
with more severe disease (p = 0.002). In various adjusted models
factoring for demographics, NRG1-beta covariates, and potential
confounders, NRG1-beta was independently associated with an increased
risk of death or cardiac transplantation (p values ranging from 0.02 to
0.04). Associations between NRG1-beta levels and adverse outcomes were
most evident in patients with ischemic heart failure compared to
patients with nonischemic failure (interaction p = 0.008) and in
patients with more advanced disease (New York Heart Association class
III/IV) compared to class I/II patients (interaction p = 0.01). These
findings were all independent of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP;
600295). Ky et al. (2009) concluded that NRG1-beta is independently
associated with heart failure severity and risk of death or cardiac
transplantation.

Combining avian blood vessel-specific gene manipulation and mouse
genetics, Saito et al. (2012) addressed a long-standing question of how
neural crest cells generate sympathetic and medullary lineages during
embryogenesis. They found that the dorsal aorta acts as a morphogenetic
signaling center that coordinates neural crest cell migration and cell
lineage segregation. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) produced by the
dorsal aorta are critical for the production of the chemokine stromal
cell-derived factor-1 (SDF1; 600835) and neuregulin-1 in the paraaortic
region, which act as chemoattractants for early migration. Later, BMP
signaling is directly involved in the sympathomedullary segregation.
Saito et al. (2012) concluded that their study provided insights into
the complex developmental signaling cascade that instructs one of the
earliest events of neurovascular interactions guiding embryonic
development.

Early social isolation results in adult behavioral and cognitive
dysfunction that correlates with white matter alterations. Makinodan et
al. (2012) showed that mice isolated for 2 weeks immediately after
weaning have alterations in prefrontal cortex function and myelination
that do not recover with reintroduction into a social environment. These
alterations, which occur only during this critical period, are
phenocopied by loss of oligodendrocyte ErbB3 (190151) receptors, and
social isolation leads to reduced expression of the ErbB3 ligand
neuregulin-1. Makinodan et al. (2012) concluded that social experience
regulates prefrontal cortex myelination through neuregulin-1/ErbB3
signaling and that this is essential for normal cognitive function, thus
providing a cellular and molecular context to understand the
consequences of social isolation.

- Possible Role in Schizophrenia

Hahn et al. (2006) found that postmortem tissue slices of prefrontal
cortex obtained from patients with schizophrenia (181500) demonstrated
significantly increased NRG1-induced activation of ERBB4 compared to
controls despite similar levels of the 2 proteins. Tissue from
schizophrenia subjects also showed increases in ERBB4-PSD95 interactions
although this finding was independent of ERBB4 stimulation. NRG1-induced
suppression of NMDA receptor activation was more pronounced in
schizophrenia subjects compared to controls, consistent with enhanced
NRG1-ERBB4 signaling. The findings were consistent with the hypothesis
that NMDA receptor hypofunction may play a role in schizophrenia.

Using human constructs and RNA interference against endogenous rat
proteins, Li et al. (2007) demonstrated that the ERBB4 receptor, as a
postsynaptic target of NRG1, plays a key role in activity-dependent
maturation and plasticity of excitatory synaptic structure and function.
Synaptic activity led to the activation and recruitment of ERBB4 into
the synapse. Overexpressed ERBB4 selectively enhanced AMPA synaptic
currents and increased dendritic spine size. Preventing NRG1/ERBB4
signaling destabilized synaptic receptors and led to loss of synaptic
NMDA currents and spines. Li et al. (2007) concluded that normal
activity-driven glutamatergic synapse development is impaired by genetic
defects in NRG1/ERBB4 signaling leading to glutaminergic hypofunction.
These findings linked proposed effectors in schizophrenia: NRB1/ERBB4
signaling perturbation, neurodevelopmental deficit, and glutamatergic
hypofunction.

Woo et al. (2007) showed that Erbb4 localized at GABAergic terminals of
rat prefrontal cortex. Studies using the endogenous rodent protein and
an exogenous human construct indicated a role for NRG1 in regulation of
GABAergic transmission. This effect was blocked by inhibition or
mutation of rodent Erbb4, suggesting the involvement of ERBB4. Taken
together, the results indicated that NRG1 regulates GABAergic
transmission via presynaptic ERBB4 receptors, identifying a novel
function of NRG1. Woo et al. (2007) suggested that since both NRG1 and
ERBB4 have emerged as susceptibility genes of schizophrenia, these
observations may indicate a mechanism for abnormal GABAergic
neurotransmission in that disorder.

Fazzari et al. (2010) showed that Nrg1 and ErbB4 (600543) signaling
controls the development of inhibitory circuitries in the mammalian
cerebral cortex by cell-autonomously regulating the connectivity of
specific GABA-containing interneurons. In contrast to the view that
supports a role for these genes in the formation and function of
excitatory synapses between pyramidal cells, Fazzari et al. (2010) found
that ErbB4 expression in the mouse neocortex and hippocampus is largely
confined to certain classes of interneurons. In particular, ErbB4 is
expressed by many parvalbumin (168890)-expressing chandelier and basket
cells, where it localizes to axon terminals and postsynaptic densities
receiving glutamatergic input. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments,
both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrated that ErbB4 cell-autonomously
promotes the formation of axo-axonic inhibitory synapses over pyramidal
cells, and that this function is probably mediated by Nrg1. In addition,
ErbB4 expression in GABA-containing interneurons regulates the formation
of excitatory synapses onto the dendrites of these cells. By contrast,
ErbB4 is dispensable for excitatory transmission between pyramidal
neurons. Fazzari et al. (2010) concluded that Nrg1 and ErbB4 signaling
is required for the wiring of GABA-mediated circuits in the postnatal
cortex, providing a new perspective to the involvement of these genes in
the etiology of schizophrenia.

NMDAR hypofunction is considered a key detrimental consequence of
excessive NRG1-ErbB4 signaling found in people with schizophrenia. Using
whole cell recordings of mouse hippocampal slices, Pitcher et al. (2011)
found that Nrg1-beta-ErbB4 signaling blocked Src (190090) kinase-induced
enhancement of NMDAR excitatory currents. However, this signaling
pathway did not affect basal NMDAR function. Similar results were
observed in pyramidal cells in the prefrontal cortex. Nrg1-beta also
prevented long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission induced by
theta-burst stimulation. The study identified Src as a downstream target
of the Nrg1-beta-ErbB4 signaling pathway, and indicated that Src
activity is an essential step in regulating synaptic plasticity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By a genomewide scan of schizophrenia (181500) families in Iceland,
Stefansson et al. (2002) showed that a schizophrenia locus maps to
chromosome 8p, as had been suggested by previous work done in 5
populations (see 603013). Extensive fine mapping of the 8p locus and
haplotype-association analysis, supplemented by a
transmission/disequilibrium test, identified NRG1 as a candidate gene
for schizophrenia. Stefansson et al. (2002) pointed out that NRG1 is
expressed at CNS synapses and has a clear role in the expression and
activation of neurotransmitter receptors, including glutamate receptors.

Stefansson et al. (2003) presented information supporting the
association of neuregulin-1 in schizophrenia in a Scottish population.
They genotyped markers representing a core at-risk haplotype found in
Icelanders at the 5-prime end of the NRG1 gene in 609 unrelated Scottish
patients and 618 unrelated Scottish control subjects. The frequency of
the 7-marker haplotype among the Scottish patients was significantly
greater than that among the control subjects (10.2% vs 5.9%), P =
0.00031). The estimated risk ratio was 1.8, which was in keeping with
the finding in unrelated Icelandic patients (2.1).

In a case-control and family-based association study of the NRG1 gene
and schizophrenia in Han Chinese, Zhao et al. (2004) found no
association of schizophrenia with the haplotype identified by Stefansson
et al. (2002, 2003) in Icelandic and Scottish populations. They did,
however, identify another haplotype to be significantly associated with
schizophrenia in both case-control (p = 0.0057) and TDT analyses (p =
0.0043).

Li et al. (2004) investigated a Han Chinese population using both a
family trio design and a case control design to determine if NRG1 is
associated with schizophrenia in Asian populations. They genotyped 25
microsatellite markers and SNPs spanning the NRG1 gene, including
markers of the 7-marker haplotype found in excess in Icelandic and
Scottish schizophrenia subjects. Li et al. (2004) identified 2 different
haplotypes at the 5-prime end of the gene and a third at the 3-prime end
of the gene that were potentially associated with schizophrenia in the
Chinese population. However, none of these haplotypes was significantly
associated with schizophrenia after correcting for multiple testing. Li
et al. (2004) concluded that the NRG1 gene may be associated with
schizophrenia in Han Chinese, but the haplotype differs from that found
in Icelandic and Scottish schizophrenic patients.

To determine if the underlying cause of the association discrepancies
between schizophrenia and polymorphisms in the NRG1 gene might be due to
population-specific genetic variation, Gardner et al. (2006) typed 13
SNPs across NRG1, including 2 of the SNPs originally associated with
schizophrenia in the Icelandic population, in 1,088 individuals from 39
populations. Most of the SNPs analyzed displayed differing frequencies
according to geographic areas. These differences were especially
relevant in 2 SNPs located in a large intron of the gene, which revealed
genetic stratification related to broad continental areas. Furthermore,
haplotype analysis revealed a clear clustering according to geographic
areas. Gardner et al. (2006) cautioned that this population diversity
must be taken into account to clarify the putative role of the NRG1 gene
in susceptibility to schizophrenia.

Go et al. (2005) performed linkage analysis on an NIMH Alzheimer disease
sample and demonstrated a specific linkage peak for Alzheimer disease
(AD; 104300) with psychosis on 8p12, which encompasses the NRG1 gene.
The authors also demonstrated a significant association between an NRG1
SNP (dbSNP rs3924999) and AD with psychosis (chi-square = 7.0; P =
0.008). This SNP is part of a 3-SNP haplotype preferentially transmitted
to individuals with the phenotype. Go et al. (2005) suggested that NRG1
plays a role in increasing the genetic risk for positive symptoms of
psychosis in a proportion of late-onset Alzheimer disease families.

Tan et al. (2007) demonstrated that a T-C SNP (dbSNP rs6994992) in
5-prime promoter region of the NRG1 gene, which has been associated with
schizophrenia (see Stefansson et al., 2002; Li et al., 2004), is a
functional promoter variant that regulates expression of the NRG1 type
IV isoform. The T allele, which is the schizophrenia risk allele, showed
a 65% increase in promoter activity.

ANIMAL MODEL

Meyer et al. (1997) found that targeted disruptions eliminating the
expression of specific Nrg1 isoforms in mice produced distinct
phenotypes. Type I Nrg1 was required for generation of neural
crest-derived neurons in cranial ganglia and for trabeculation of the
heart ventricle, whereas type III Nrg1 was required for early
development of Schwann cells.

Mice homozygous for disruptions of all NRG1 isoforms, all Ig-NRG1
isoforms, and all cytoplasmic tail-containing isoforms die at embryonic
day 10.5 from cardiac defects. In particular, these mice die before
significant expression of CRD-NRG1 isoforms, which predominate after
midgestation. By histologic analyses, Wolpowitz et al. (2000) found that
homozygous CRD-NRG1-deficient mice had normal neuronal trajectory and
outgrowth, but that the projections defasciculated, branched abnormally,
and failed to sustain peripheral neuromuscular synaptic development.
Newborn mutants had immature skeletal muscle. Schwann cells were
generated in the mutants but failed to survive, consistent with the
designation of NRG1 as a Schwann cell survival factor. Schwann cells in
turn appeared to provide trophic support only after the nerve had
entered its target field and had begun synapse formation.

Rentschler et al. (2002) showed that neuregulin-1, a growth and
differentiation factor essential for trabeculation of the cardiac
ventricle, is sufficient to induce ectopic expression of a marker of the
cardiac conduction system in the mouse. This inductive effect was
restricted to a window of sensitivity between 8.5 and 10.5 days
postcoitum. They described the electrical activation pattern of the
9.5-days postcoitum embryonic mouse heart and showed that treatment with
neuregulin-1 results in electrophysiologic changes in the activation
system consistent with a recruitment of cells to the conduction system.
Thus, endocardial-derived neuregulins may be the major endogenous
ligands responsible for inducing murine embryonic cardiomyocytes to
differentiate into cells of the conduction system.

Stefansson et al. (2002) presented results from animal studies
suggesting involvement of NRG1 in susceptibility to schizophrenia.
Mutant mice heterozygous for either NRG1 or its receptor, ERBB4, showed
a behavioral phenotype that overlapped with mouse models of
schizophrenia. Furthermore, NRG1 hypomorphs had fewer functional NMDA
receptors than wildtype mice. Stefansson et al. (2002) also demonstrated
that the behavioral phenotypes of the NRG1 hypomorphs were partially
reversible with clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug used to treat
schizophrenia.

Hippenmeyer et al. (2002) found that type I and type II Nrg1, which both
contain an Ig domain, were expressed preferentially by Trkc (NTRK3;
191316)-positive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons at a
developmental stage when proprioceptive afferents first invade muscles.
In contrast, type III Nrg1, which contains a cysteine-rich domain, was
expressed broadly by DRG neurons and motor neurons. Hippenmeyer et al.
(2002) created mice with conditional deletion of Nrg1 in embryonic DRG
and motor neurons. Elimination of all Nrg1 isoforms from DRG and motor
neurons impaired muscle spindle differentiation and resulted in failure
of proprioceptive afferents to elaborate annulospiral terminals. Muscle
spindle differentiation proceeded normally in mice that selectively
lacked type III Nrg1. Hippenmeyer et al. (2002) concluded that NRG1
signaling is critical in the early induction of muscle spindle
differentiation.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD; 310200) is a fatal disorder caused by
absence of dystrophin (300377). Utrophin (UTRN; 128240) is a chromosome
6-encoded dystrophin-related protein that has functional motifs in
common with dystrophin. The ability of utrophin to compensate for
dystrophin during development and when transgenically overexpressed
provided an important impetus for identifying activators of utrophin
expression. The utrophin promoter A is transcriptionally regulated in
part by heregulin-mediated, extracellular signal-related
kinase-dependent activation of the GABP(alpha/beta) transcription factor
complex (see 600610). Therefore, this pathway offers a potential
mechanism to modulate utrophin expression in muscle. Krag et al. (2004)
tested the ability of heregulin to improve the dystrophic phenotype in
the mdx mouse model of DMD. Intraperitoneal injections of the small
peptide encoding the epidermal growth factor-like region of heregulin
ectodomain for 3 months in vivo resulted in upregulation of utrophin, a
marked improvement in the mechanical properties of muscle as evidenced
by resistance to eccentric contraction-mediated damage, and a reduction
of muscle pathology. The amelioration of dystrophic phenotype by
heregulin-mediated utrophin upregulation offered a pharmacologic
therapeutic modality that obviates many of the toxicity and delivery
issues associated with viral vector-based gene therapy for DMD.

Escher et al. (2005) demonstrated that neuromuscular junctions (NMJs)
can form in the absence of the neuregulin receptors ErbB2 and ErbB4 in
mouse muscle. Postsynaptic differentiation was, however, induced by
agrin (103320). Escher et al. (2005) therefore concluded that neuregulin
signaling to muscle is not required for NMJ formation. The effects of
neuregulin signaling to muscle may be mediated indirectly through
Schwann cells.

Wood et al. (2009) mapped the expression of zebrafish Disc1 (605210) and
studied its role in early embryonic development using morpholino
antisense methods. There was a critical requirement for Disc1 in
oligodendrocyte development by promoting specification of Olig2
(606386)-positive cells in the hindbrain and other brain regions.
Disruption of Nrg1 and ErbB (EGFR; 131550) signaling in zebrafish brain
development yielded similar defects to those seen in Disc1-morphant
embryos. Knockdown of Disc1 or Nrg1 caused near total loss of
Olig2-positive cerebellar neurons, but caused no apparent loss of spinal
motor neurons. Wood et al. (2009) suggested that Disc1 and Nrg1 function
in common or related pathways controlling development of
oligodendrocytes and neurons from Olig2-expressing precursor cells.

607183	TITLE *607183 SEC24-RELATED GENE FAMILY, MEMBER A; SEC24A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In yeast, the Sec23-Sec24 complex is a component of coat protein II
(COPII; see 601924)-coated vesicles that mediate protein transport from
the endoplasmic reticulum. SEC24A is 1 of several mammalian proteins
that show structural and functional homology to yeast Sec24.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologs of yeast Sec24 proteins,
screening a size-selected B-lymphocyte cDNA library, and 5-prime RACE,
Pagano et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding SEC24A. The deduced
1,078-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 118
kD. Pagano et al. (1999) noted, however, that the sequence is likely
incomplete because it lacks the initiator ATG. RNase protection assays
demonstrated that SEC24A, SEC24B (607184), and SEC24C (607185) were
expressed simultaneously in several cell lines, including lines
originating from fibroblasts, hepatocytes, and lymphocytes. The major
difference in expression was a constant 2- to 3-fold lower level of
expression of SEC24B compared with SEC24A and SEC24C.

Tang et al. (1999) determined that SEC24A and SEC24B share about 56%
sequence identity, while SEC24C and SEC24D (607186) share about 52%
identity. However, the identity shared between these 2 pairs is only
about 20%.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SEC24A
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP stSG9839).

602256	TITLE *602256 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE, EF-HAND CALCIUM-BINDING DOMAIN 2; PPEF2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

During random sequencing of human retina cDNAs, Sherman et al. (1997)
identified a homolog of Drosophila rdgC. Full-length cDNAs of the gene,
termed PPEF2, predicted a 753-amino acid protein that is 39% identical
to that of Drosophila rdgC and has a domain structure similar to that of
rdgC and PPEF1 (300109). Sherman et al. (1997) noted the existence of a
shorter alternatively spliced form of PPEF2, termed PPEF2(S), that uses
alternative splice acceptor sites in exons 5 and 14 and predicts a
598-amino acid protein lacking EF-hand domains. Northern blot analysis
of rat tissues revealed a 3.7-kb PPEF2 mRNA in retina. In situ
hybridization and cell fractionation experiments further revealed that
the gene is expressed exclusively in the inner segments of the
photoreceptor cells of the retina and in the pineal gland. Sherman et
al. (1997) stated that the inner segment localization implies that PPEF2
probably does not dephosphorylate rhodopsin and is probably not directly
involved in phototransduction.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic analysis, Sherman et al. (1997) determined that the PPEF2
gene contains at least 15 exons spanning 33 kb.

MAPPING

Sherman et al. (1997) used Southern blot hybridization and PCR of
human-rodent cell lines to map the PPEF2 gene to human chromosome 4.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ramulu et al. (2001) produced mice carrying targeted disruptions in the
Ppef1 and Ppef2 genes. By analyzing both single and double mutant mice,
they observed that rod light responses and rhodopsin dephosphorylation
kinetics were normal. Furthermore, there was no evidence of retinal
degeneration in the PPEF mutant mice. Ramulu et al. (2001) concluded
that in contrast to loss of rdgC function in Drosophila, elimination of
PPEF function does not cause retinal degeneration in vertebrates.

610230	TITLE *610230 tRNA 5-METHYLAMINOMETHYL-2-THIOURIDYLATE METHYLTRANSFERASE; TRMU
;;TRNT1;;
MTO2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; MTO2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRMU is an evolutionarily conserved protein involved in mitochondrial
tRNA modification, and is thus important for mitochondrial translation
(Yan et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching a database for sequences similar to yeast Mto2, followed by
RT-PCR of a human osteosarcoma cell line cDNA library, Yan et al. (2005)
cloned TRMU, which they designated MTO2. Fluorescence-tagged MTO2
localized to mitochondria.

By 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Yan et al. (2006) identified several TRMU
splice variants. The full-length 421-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 47.7 kD. The other transcripts lack exon 3 and encode
a deduced 99-amino acid protein. Northern blot analysis detected high
expression of a 1.9-kb TRMU transcript in heart, skeletal muscle, and
kidney. Intermediate expression was detected in brain, placenta, spleen,
and small intestine, and low expression was detected in liver, colon,
lung, thymus, and leukocytes. Expression was nearly uniform in 8 brain
regions examined.

Yan and Guan (2004) cloned mouse Trmu. The deduced 417-amino acid
protein contains a typical mitochondrial target sequence and shares 91%
identity with human TRMU.

GENE FUNCTION

Yan et al. (2005) demonstrated that human MTO2 could partially restore
the respiratory-deficient phenotype of Mto2-null yeast carrying a
mutation in 15S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), 1409C-G, associated with
aminoglycoside resistance. The yeast 1409C-G mutation in 15S rRNA
corresponds to the deafness-associated 1494C-T mutation (561000.0004) in
human 12S rRNA (MTRNR1; 561000).

In families with the deafness-associated 12S rRNA 1555A-G mutation
(561000.0001), Yan et al. (2006) found suggestive linkage and linkage
disequilibrium between microsatellite markers adjacent to TRMU and the
presence of deafness. They hypothesized that TRMU may modulate the
phenotypic manifestation of deafness-associated mitochondrial 12S rRNA
mutations.

Guan et al. (2006) noted that TRMU is responsible for the 2-thiolation
of hypermodified nucleoside 5-methyl-aminomethy-2-thio-uridine. This
modified nucleotide, found in the wobble position of several bacterial
and human mitochondrial tRNAs (mt tRNAs) specific for glutamate, lysine,
and glutamine, has a pivotal role in the structure and function of
tRNAs, including structural stabilization, aminoacylation, and codon
recognition at the decoding site of small rRNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yan et al. (2006) determined that the TRMU gene contains 11 exons and
spans about 22 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Yan et al. (2006) mapped the TRMU gene to
chromosome 22q13. Yan and Guan (2004) mapped the mouse Trmu gene to
chromosome 15.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Deafness Modification

The 1555A-G mutation of mitochondrial 12S rRNA (561000.0001) is
associated with aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic deafness in many
families worldwide (Prezant et al., 1993). Studies of Guan et al. (1996,
2001) revealed that the 1555A-G mutation, although a primary factor
underlying the development of deafness, is not alone sufficient to
produce a deafness phenotype. Nuclear modifier genes have been proposed
as modulators of the phenotypic manifestations of the mitochondrial
mutation. Guan et al. (2006) identified the nuclear modifier gene TRMU,
which encodes a highly conserved mitochondrial protein related to
transfer RNA (tRNA) modification. Studies in a large Arab Israeli
kindred, in an Italian family, and in 6 Spanish families carrying the
1555A-G or the 1494C-T (561000.0004) mutation revealed a missense
mutation (610230.0001) altering an invariant amino acid residue (A10S)
in the evolutionarily conserved N-terminal region of the TRMU protein.
All members of the Arab Israeli, Italian, and Spanish families carrying
both the TRMU A10S and the 12S rRNA 1555A-G mutations exhibited
prelingual profound deafness. Functional analysis showed that the A10S
mutation did not affect importation of TRMU precursors into
mitochondria. However, the homozygous A10S mutation led to a marked
failure in mitochondrial tRNA metabolisms, specifically reducing the
steady-state levels of mitochondrial tRNA. As a consequence, these
defects contributed to the impairment of mitochondrial protein
synthesis. These findings indicated that the mutated TRMU, acting as a
modifier factor, modulates the phenotypic manifestation of the
deafness-associated 12S rRNA mutations.

- Transient Infantile Liver Failure

By linkage analysis, followed by candidate gene sequencing, Zeharia et
al. (2009) identified homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in
the TRMU gene (see, e.g., 610230.0002-610230.0005) in patients with
transient infantile liver failure (LFIT; 613070). Seven patients of
Yemenite Jewish origin had the same Y77H mutation (610230.0002),
indicating a founder effect. Overall, 9 mutations were identified in 13
patients. Those who survived the initial acute episode showed clinical
and biochemical resolution of liver failure and had no further episodes.
A study of tRNAs in cells derived from 3 of the patients showed a severe
reduction of thio-modified mitochondrial tRNAs, whereas the pattern of
hybridization obtained for the cytosolic tRNA-lys, modified by another
enzyme, was similar to controls. The findings suggested that the
mitochondrial translation defect resulted from reduced modification of
several mitochondrial tRNAs. Noting that the availability of cysteine in
the neonatal period is limited, Zeharia et al. (2009) proposed that
there is a window of time during 1 to 4 months of age during which
patients with TRMU mutations are at an increased risk of developing
liver failure.

In a large Arab Israeli kindred, in an Italian family, and in 6 Spanish
families with sensorineural deafness carrying the 1555A-G (561000.0001)
or the 1494C-T (561000.0004) mutation in mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA
(rRNA), Guan et al. (2006) found that a 28G-T transversion in exon 1 of
the TRMU gene, resulting in an ala10-to-ser substitution (A10S),
modifies the phenotypic expression of the 12S rRNA mutation. All members
of the Arab-Israeli and Italian-Spanish families carrying both the TRMU
A10S and the 12S rRNA 1555A-G mutations exhibited prelingual profound
deafness. The A10S mutation results in a defect in 2-thio modification
in mitochondrial tRNAs, which leads to decreases of the steady-state
level of mitochondrial tRNAs, subsequently causing the impairment of
mitochondrial translation. Resultant biochemical defects aggravate the
mitochondrial dysfunction below the threshold for normal cell function,
thereby expressing the deafness phenotype.

In 5 Yemenite Jewish patients with transient infantile liver failure
(613070), Zeharia et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 232T-C
transition in the TRMU gene, resulting in a tyr77-to-his (Y77H)
substitution. Another Yemenite Jewish patient was compound heterozygous
for Y77H and a splice site mutation (610230.0003).

mutations in the TRMU gene: a G-to-A transition, resulting in the
skipping of exon 3, and the Y77H mutation (610230.0002).

In 2 Algerian patients with transient infantile liver failure (613070),
Zeharia et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 2T-A transversion in the
TRMU gene, resulting in a met1-to-lys (M1K) substitution in the
initiation codon. The infants presented at ages 1 and 2 days,
respectively, and died at ages 3 and 4 months, respectively. The
mutation was not identified in 106 individuals of North African origin.

In a 4-year-old Irish girl with transient infantile liver failure
(613070), Uusimaa et al. (2011) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the TRMU gene: an 835G-A transition resulting in a
val279-to-met (V279M) substitution in a highly conserved residue, and a
splice site mutation (610230.0007). Each unaffected parent was
heterozygous for 1 of the mutations. The patient presented in infancy
with acute liver failure and lactic acidosis with profound cytochrome c
oxidase deficiency in muscle and liver samples. Brain MRI showed
abnormal high signal in the right thalamus, which disappeared by age 1
year. She also had feeding difficulties and hypotonia in early infancy.
Although she recovered, she had mildly delayed walking, axial weakness,
and bulbar involvement.

TRMU, IVS11AS, C-G, -3

In a girl with transient infantile liver failure (613070), Uusimaa et
al. (2011) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
TRMU gene: a C-to-G transversion in intron 11, causing a splice site
mutation, and V279M (610230.0006). The splice site mutation resulted in
50% aberrantly spliced transcript, which generated a frameshift and
premature termination.

603359	TITLE *603359 NADH-UBIQUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE 1 ALPHA SUBCOMPLEX, 8; NDUFA8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is embedded in the
mitochondrial inner membrane and catalyzes the first step in oxidative
phosphorylation. It couples the oxidation of NADH to the reduction of
ubiquinone and the translocation of protons across the inner membrane.
Complex I originated from a 14- to 17-subunit bacterial complex and
acquired 25 to 30 subunits of eukaryotic origin. NDUFA8 is a eukaryotic
complex I subunit that resides in the mitochondrial intermembrane space
(summary by Szklarczyk et al., 2011).

CLONING

Triepels et al. (1998) reported the cloning of the cDNA sequence of the
nuclear-encoded NDUFA8 subunit of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, the
complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The NDUFA8 open
reading frame includes 519 bp and encodes 172 amino acids. The human
cDNA sequence shows 86.2% identity with the bovine sequence, whereas the
human NDUFA8 amino acid sequence is 87.8% similar to its bovine
counterpart. A multiple tissue blot revealed the highest NDUFA8 mRNA
expression in human heart, skeletal muscle, and fetal heart.

Szklarczyk et al. (2011) stated that the NDUFA8 protein lacks a
mitochondrial targeting signal and transmembrane domains. However, it
has 2 Cx(9)C motifs that include an intermembrane space targeting
signal. Protease digestion of mitoplasts isolated from HEK293 cells
suggested that NDUFA8 localizes to the intermembrane space.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of rodent/human somatic cell hybrids, Triepels et al.
(1998) mapped the human NDUFA8 gene to chromosome 9. By radiation hybrid
analysis, Emahazion et al. (1998) mapped the NDUFA8 gene to
9q33.2-q34.11.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Using molecular modeling, Szklarczyk et al. (2011) found that the
cysteines of the Cx(9)C motifs in NDUF8A are not involved in Fe-S
cluster binding, but likely stabilize a hairpin conformation in which
alpha helices between the cysteines align in an antiparallel manner.
This stabilized alpha helix was predicted to trap NDUF8A in the
mitochondrial intermembrane space and prevent membrane translocation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Triepels et al. (1998) performed mutation analysis of the NDUFA8
fibroblast cDNA in 20 patients with isolated enzymatic complex I
deficiency in cultured skin fibroblasts and found 2 polymorphisms: one
was a 126A-G transition within the open reading frame and the other was
a 583A-G transition in the 3-prime untranslated region of the NDUFA8
cDNA sequence. The allelic frequency of both polymorphisms were similar
in controls and complex I-deficient patients.

Smeitink and van den Heuvel (1999) reviewed the available molecular data
regarding the human nuclear-encoded complex I subunits.

By sequencing the entire mitochondrial DNA and 11 nuclear-encoded
subunits in 23 patients with isolated mitochondrial complex I deficiency
(252010), Bugiani et al. (2004) found 1 patient who was compound
heterozygous for 2 variants on 2 different genes: an ala224-to-val
(A224V) substitution in the NDUFS2 gene (602985) and a 325G-A transition
in the NDUFA8 gene, resulting in a glu109-to-lys (E109K) substitution.
The patient had severe neonatal hypotonia, dysmorphic features,
epilepsy, and signs of brainstem involvement leading to death age 2
months. Plasma lactate was intermittently high; complex I activity was
decreased to 13% of control values in skeletal muscle, but was normal in
fibroblasts. Of note, the patient was born to consanguineous Italian
parents, each of whom carried 1 of the variants. Analysis of cDNA in the
patient showed only wildtype NDUFA8, suggesting that the 325G-A change
is associated with instability of the variant transcript. Both variants
were absent in 250 control alleles, but the 325G-A variant did not occur
in a highly conserved residue.

609130	TITLE *609130 APOPTOSIS-INDUCING, TAF9-LIKE DOMAIN 1; APITD1
;;CENTROMERIC PROTEIN S; CENPS;;
FANCM-INTERACTING HISTONE-FOLD PROTEIN 1; MHF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Fanconi anemia (FA) nuclear core complex (see 607139) is required
for DNA damage response and repair. STRA13 (615128) and APITD1 form a
heterodimeric DNA-remodeling complex that interacts with the FA complex
component FANCM (609644) to facilitate repair of branched DNA (Yan et
al., 2010; Singh et al., 2010).

CLONING

Using in silico mapping methods, Krona et al. (2004) identified 2
alternatively spliced transcripts of a novel gene, designated APITD1,
within a 500-kb neuroblastoma tumor suppressor candidate region on
chromosome 1p36.22. Transcript A encodes a deduced 138-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 16 kD, and transcript B
encodes a deduced 99-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass
of 11 kD. Both proteins contain a TAF9 (313650)-like domain. Northern
blot analysis of neuroblastoma cell lines detected ubiquitous expression
of a major, approximately 1.5 kb and a minor, less than 1 kb transcript.
Expression of transcript A was generally higher in fetal tissues,
whereas that of transcript B was higher in adult tissues. Expression of
both was significantly reduced in several primary neuroblastoma tumors
and in tumors of varied tissue origin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krona et al. (2004) determined that the APITD1 gene contains 6 exons,
including alternative exons 1A and 1B, and spans about 13 kb. Both exons
1A and 1B are preceded by a CpG island.

MAPPING

By analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids, Krona et al. (2004)
mapped the APITD1 gene to chromosome 1. By genomic sequence analysis,
they refined the location of the gene to 1p36.22, in a head-to-tail
orientation between the PGD (172200) and CORT (602784) genes.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation of CENPA (117139)-containing complexes from HeLa
cells, followed by multiple tandem affinity purifications, Foltz et al.
(2006) identified CENPS associated with CENPM (610152) and CENPU
(MLF1IP; 611511) but not directly associated with the CENPA
nucleosome-associated complex.

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis of chicken DT40 cells, Amano et al.
(2009) found that Cenps interacted with Cenpx (STRA13), but not with
other centromeric proteins, in a centromeric protein subcomplex. Cenps
-/- and Cenpx -/- DT40 cells showed slow mitotic progression and
increased numbers of apoptotic cells. Knockdown of CENPS and CENPX in
HeLa cells via small interfering RNA caused more severe mitotic defects,
including misaligned chromosomes. Knockdown of CENPX in DT40 and HeLa
cells eliminated kinetochore localization of CENPS. Knockout of Cenps
and Cenpx reduced localization of the outer kinetochore proteins Ndc80
(607272) and Knl1 (CASC5; 609173) and increased intrakinetochore
distance in the absence of tension. Amano et al. (2009) proposed that
the CENPS-CENPX subcomplex is essential for stable assembly of outer
kinetochore proteins.

Yan et al. (2010) and Singh et al. (2010) independently found that
APITD1 and STRA13, which they called MHF1 and MHF2, were associated with
a high-molecular-mass complex containing FA complex components and Bloom
syndrome complex components (e.g., RECQL3; 604610). MHF1 and MHF2 also
associated in a much smaller complex distinct from the FA core complex.
Coimmunoprecipitation and yeast 2-hybrid analyses confirmed direct
interaction between MHF1 and MHF2. MHF1 and MHF2 appeared to associate
predominantly with FANCM and FAAP24 (C19ORF40; 610884), but not with
other FA complex components. MHF1 mediated interaction of the MHF1-MHF2
heterodimer with FANCM. The MHF1-MHF2 heterodimer, but not either
component alone, also bound several types of branched DNA and enhanced
FANCM binding to branched DNA. HeLa cells depleted of either MHF protein
displayed reduced monoubiquitination and foci formation by FANCD2
(613984) in response to DNA damage. Depletion of the MHF proteins also
resulted in hypersensitivity of cells to DNA-damaging agents. Yan et al.
(2010) found that FANCM and the MHF proteins were recruited to DNA
interstrand crosslinks during S phase, apparently stimulated by DNA
replication. Using a DNA branch migration assay, Singh et al. (2010)
found that the MHF1-MHF2 dimer itself was devoid of activity, but that
it enhanced FANCM-dependent DNA branch migration. Yan et al. (2010) and
Singh et al. (2010) concluded that the MHF1-MHF2 heterodimer is required
for normal activation of the FA pathway in response to DNA damage.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Krona et al. (2004) performed genomic sequence analysis of the APITD1
gene in 44 neuroblastoma tumors and identified no loss-of-function
mutations, indicating that the gene is not a common abnormality of such
tumors.

;;JPO1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using representational difference analysis to identify c-Myc target
genes that may participate in the anchorage-independent growth phenotype
conferred by overexpression of c-Myc in Rat1a cells, Prescott et al.
(2001) identified a novel gene, which they called JPO1, and subsequently
cloned the full-length human cDNA from a spleen cDNA library. JPO1
encodes a deduced 371-amino acid protein with a putative leucine zipper
and a cysteine-rich region. Dot-blot analysis of RNA from multiple human
tissues detected highest levels of JPO1 in small intestine and thymus,
high levels in fetal thymus, fetal lung, colon, stomach, and appendix,
and low levels in bone marrow, spleen, lymph node, and peripheral blood
leukocytes. Western blot analysis identified a 47-kD JPO1 band.
Immunofluorescent microscopy of transiently transfected COS-7 cells
showed strong nuclear staining.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Northern blot analysis, Prescott et al. (2001) observed higher
JPO1 mRNA levels in adherent than nonadherent Rat1a cells, and in
Rat1a-Myc cells than Rat1a cells. An RNase protection assay indicated a
20-fold higher JPO1 transcript level in nonadherent Rat1a-Myc
fibroblasts than in nonadherent Rat1a fibroblasts. Western blot analysis
revealed a positive correlation between JPO1 and c-Myc protein levels in
human lymphoid cell lines and breast cancer cell lines. Using a
Myc-inducible cell line, Prescott et al. (2001) found that JPO1
expression was increased upon induction of c-Myc expression. Additional
analyses suggested that JPO1 is a direct c-Myc target gene.
Overexpression of JPO1 in Rat1a and CB33 human B lymphoid cells did not
alter cellular growth rates or change levels of apoptosis, but did
induce anchorage-independent growth of Rat1a cells and increased
clonogenicity of CB33 cells. Prescott et al. (2001) determined, however,
that JPO1 is insufficient for tumorigenesis in the nude mouse xenograft
model.

Prescott et al. (2001) found that JPO1 can complement the defect in the
c-Myc mutant W135E, which cannot efficiently transform Rat1a cells. JPO1
is severely impaired in W135E cells. Coexpression of JPO1 and W135E
significantly increased Rat1a cell colony formation to a level
comparable to that of c-Myc alone.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Prescott et al. (2001) mapped the
JPO1 gene to chromosome 2q31.

;;LARGE MULTIFUNCTIONAL PROTEASE 7; LMP7;;
PROTEASOME-RELATED GENE 7;;
RING10;;
PROTEASOME SUBUNIT BETA-5I
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The immunoproteasome, a distinct class of proteasome found predominantly
in monocytes and lymphocytes, shapes the antigenic repertoire presented
on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. PSMB8
encodes the chymotrypsin-like catalytic subunit of the immunoproteasome
(Muchamuel et al., 2009).

GENE STRUCTURE

Agarwal et al. (2010) noted that the PSMB8 gene contains 6 exons with
alternative splicing of exons 1A and 1B.

MAPPING

Antigen processing involves the generation of peptides from cytosolic
proteins and their transport into the endoplasmic reticulum, where they
associate with MHC class I molecules. Two genes have been identified in
the MHC class II region, TAP1 (170260) and TAP2 (170261), that are
thought to encode the peptide transport proteins. Glynne et al. (1991)
reported a proteasome-related sequence, RING10, mapping between the
transporter genes on chromosome 6p21.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Muchamuel et al. (2009) showed that PR-957, a selective inhibitor of
LMP7, blocked presentation of MHC class I-restricted antigens in vitro
and in vivo. PR-957 also blocked production of IL23 (see 605580) by
activated monocytes and IL2 (147680) and IFNG (147570) by T cells. In
mouse models, PR-957 reversed signs of rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300)
and cellular infiltration, cytokine production, and autoantibody levels.
Muchamuel et al. (2009) concluded that LMP7 has a role in controlling
pathogenic immune responses and may be a target in autoimmune disorders.

Incorporation of the proteasome beta subunits into the maturing
proteasome frequently requires proteolytic removal of a prosequence by
proteolytically active subunits. By following the incorporation of
mutant human LMP7 into the 20S proteasome, Witt et al. (2000) showed
that the LMP7 prosequence was not essential for incorporation of LMP7
into the maturing proteasome, but it increased the efficiency of LMP7
incorporation and proteasome maturation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Deng et al. (1995) found evidence suggesting that LMP genes have effects
on susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM; 222100),
independent of HLA-DR and HLA-DQ. A genomic polymorphism of LMP7 was
found to be strongly associated with IDDM, and the arg/his-60
polymorphism in LMP2 (309060) was found to be associated with IDDM in
subjects containing an HLA-DR4-DQB1*0302 haplotype.

By genomewide homozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene sequencing
of the 3 patients with autoinflammatory, lipodystrophy, and dermatosis
syndrome (ALDD; 256040) reported by Garg et al. (2010), Agarwal et al.
(2010) identified the same homozygous mutation in the PSMB8 gene (T75M;
177046.0001).

Kitamura et al. (2011) identified a homozygous PSMB8 mutation (G197V;
177046.0002) in 3 Japanese patients from 2 consanguineous families with
the Nakajo-Nishimura autoinflammatory syndrome. One of the families had
previously been reported by Tanaka et al. (1993). The mutation increased
assembly intermediates of immunoproteasomes, resulting in decreased
proteasome function and ubiquitin-coupled protein accumulation in
patient tissues. In addition, IL6 (147620) was highly expressed and
there was reduced expression of PSMB8. In vitro studies showed that
downregulation of PSMB8 inhibited the differentiation of murine and
human adipocytes in vitro, and injection of siRNA against Psmb8 in mouse
skin reduced adipocyte tissue volume. The findings identified PSMB8 as
an essential component and regulator of inflammation and of adipocyte
differentiation, suggesting that immunoproteasomes have pleiotropic
functions in maintaining the homeostasis of a variety of cell types.

In 5 patients with an autoinflammatory disorder previously designated
CANDLE syndrome for 'chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with
lipodystrophy and elevated temperature' (Torrelo et al., 2010), Liu et
al. (2012) identified homozygous mutations in the PSMB8 gene
(177046.0001 and 177046.0004). Two additional patients were heterozygous
for a PSMB8 mutation, but a second pathogenic mutation could not be
found. The patients had high levels of gamma-interferon-induced
protein-10 (CXCL10; 147310), as well as other inflammatory markers.
Microarray profiling suggested dysregulation of the interferon signaling
pathway, particularly gamma-interferon.

ANIMAL MODEL

Fehling et al. (1994) found that mice with a targeted deletion of the
Lmp7 gene had reduced levels of MHC class I cell-surface expression and
presented an endogenous antigen inefficiently.

NOMENCLATURE

The original designation for this gene, RING10, is an acronym for
'really interesting new gene.' The 'D number' of this expressed sequence
was D6S216E.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AUTOINFLAMMATION, LIPODYSTROPHY, AND DERMATOSIS SYNDROME
PSMB8, THR75MET

In 3 affected members from 2 unrelated families with an autoinflammatory
disorder termed 'joint contractures, muscle atrophy, microcytic anemia,
and panniculitis-induced lipodystrophy' (256040), Agarwal et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 224C-T transition in exon 2 of the PSMB8 gene,
resulting in a thr75-to-met (T75M) substitution in a highly conserved
residue. The mutation was not found in 275 controls but was present in
heterozygosity in available parents and unaffected sibs. The patients
had previously been reported by Garg et al. (2010) and were of
Portuguese and Mexican origin, respectively. The parents of the
Portuguese patients were consanguineous, whereas consanguinity was
suspected in the parents of the Mexican patients. Haplotype analysis
indicated identity by descent, but the mutation appeared to be ancient.
Molecular dynamics simulation indicated that the mutation relaxed the
protein structure by 1.2 angstrom, and may affect the proteolytic
processing of peptides. Studies of patient lymphocytes showed that the
mutant protein had markedly decreased chymotrypsin-like activity
compared to wildtype, consistent with a decrease in proteasomal activity
and loss of function. Laboratory studies of the 2 Mexican sibs performed
by Agarwal et al. (2010) showed that both had significantly increased
levels of serum IL6 (147620) and gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570), and 1
had increased IL8 (146930). Other cytokines were not elevated,
suggesting a particular biomarker signature. The disorder is
characterized by childhood onset of joint stiffness and severe
contractures of the hands and feet, erythematous skin lesions with
subsequent development of severe lipodystrophy, and laboratory evidence
of immune dysregulation. Accompanying features include muscle weakness
and atrophy, hepatosplenomegaly, and microcytic anemia. The findings
indicated that dysfunction of the immunoproteasome can result in an
autoinflammatory disease.

Liu et al. (2012) identified a homozygous T75M mutation in 4 unrelated
patients with an autoinflammatory disorder previously designated CANDLE
syndrome for 'chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with
lipodystrophy and elevated temperature' (Torrelo et al., 2010). The
clinical features were similar to those reported by Garg et al. (2010).
Two patients reported by Liu et al. (2012) were of Hispanic origin and 2
were of Spanish origin. However, only 2 patients shared the same
haplotype, suggesting that this is a mutational hotspot. Two additional
patients reported by Liu et al. (2012) were heterozygous for the T75M
mutation, but a second mutation was not detected.

AUTOINFLAMMATION, LIPODYSTROPHY, AND DERMATOSIS SYNDROME
PSMB8, GLY197VAL

In 3 Japanese patients from 2 consanguineous families with an
autoinflammatory disorder termed 'Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome' (256040),
Kitamura et al. (2011) identified a homozygous G-to-T transversion in
the PSMB8 gene, resulting in a gly197-to-val (G197V) substitution in a
conserved surface-exposed position in a beta-hairpin turn; the affected
residue is G201V in the other isoform of the protein. The mutation was
not found in 624 control alleles. Patient B cells showed decreased
levels of the mature protein and increased proportion of
immunoproteasome intermediates, as well as decreased proteasome
activity, and patient skin cells showed accumulated ubiquitinated
proteins. IL6 (147620) expression was increased in patient tissues. One
of the families had previously been reported by Tanaka et al. (1993).

.0003
AUTOINFLAMMATION, LIPODYSTROPHY, AND DERMATOSIS SYNDROME
PSMB8, GLY201VAL

In 5 unrelated Japanese patients with an autoinflammatory disorder
termed 'Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome' (256040), Arima et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 602G-T transversion in exon 5 of the PSMB8 gene,
resulting in a gly201-to-val (G201V) substitution in a highly conserved
residue. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect. The mutation is
located at the edge of the S8 beta-sheet of the protein, close to the
catalytic residue thr73, and was predicted to cause conformational
changes of catalytic residues thr73 and lys105 as well as affecting the
interface of the protein with other proteasome subunits. Patient-derived
lymphoblastoid cell lines showed markedly decreased chymotrypsin-like
activity compared to controls. Trypsin-like and caspase-like activity
were also decreased. Western blot analysis showed reduced levels of the
20S proteasome, consistent with an assembly defect. Patient cells showed
decreased proteolytic activity with an accumulation of ubiquitinated and
oxidized proteins, and patient skin biopsies showed activation of an
inflammatory response. Patient sera showed increased IL6 (147620) and
IL10 (124092) associated with increased intracellular phosphorylated p38
(MAPK14; 600289), which may be related to increased inflammation. The
findings suggested that decreased proteasome activity can affect signal
transduction and promote inflammation.

.0004
AUTOINFLAMMATION, LIPODYSTROPHY, AND DERMATOSIS SYNDROME
PSMB8, CYS135TER

In a 12.5-year-old Ashkenazi Jewish boy with an autoinflammatory
disorder characterized by chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with
lipodystrophy and elevated temperature (256040), Liu et al. (2012)
identified a homozygous 405C-A transversion in exon 3 of the PSMB8 gene,
resulting in a cys135-to-ter (C135X) substitution, leading to a large
deletion of the terminal 141 residues. The mutant protein was predicted
to interfere with proper assembly of the proteasome. The patient
presented at 1 month of age with fever and skin lesions. He later
developed annular plaques, recurrent fevers, lipodystrophy,
hepatomegaly, arthritis/arthralgia, violaceous eyelids, microcytic
anemia, and elevated liver enzymes.

300561	TITLE *300561 SLIT- AND NTRK-LIKE FAMILY, MEMBER 2; SLITRK2
;;KIAA1854
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the SLITRK family, such as SLITRK2, are integral membrane
proteins with 2 N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains similar to
those of SLIT proteins (see SLIT1; 603742). Most SLITRKs, including
SLITRK2, also have C-terminal regions that share homology with
neurotrophin receptors (see NTRK1; 191315). SLITRKs are expressed
predominantly in neural tissues and have neurite-modulating activity
(Aruga et al., 2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned SLITRK2, which they designated
KIAA1854. The deduced protein contains 572 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected intermediate expression in adult and fetal brain, adult spinal
cord, and all specific brain regions examined. Little to no expression
was detected in nonneural tissues.

Aruga and Mikoshiba (2003) cloned several mouse Slitrk cDNAs, including
Slitrk2. The deduced Slitrk2 protein contains an N-terminal signal
peptide, followed by 2 LRR domains, a transmembrane domain, and a
cytoplasmic domain with 4 putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Each
LRR domain is flanked by cysteine-rich regions. Northern blot analysis
of several mouse tissues detected high Slitrk2 expression only in brain.
In situ hybridization of developing mouse brain revealed broad Slitrk2
expression, with significant expression in the ventricular layer
(particularly the ventricular side), subventricular zone, cortical
plate, pyramidal layer of hippocampus, subicular neuroepithelium,
thalamus, hypothalamus, and spinal cord. In a rat pheochromocytoma cell
line, Slitrk2 localized to the trans-Golgi network and the cell
periphery.

By database analysis, Aruga et al. (2003) identified human SLITRK2. The
deduced 845-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 95.4
kD. It shares more than 95% homology with mouse Slitrk2 and has the same
protein structure. Northern blot analysis detected SLITRK2 transcripts
of 5.1 and 4.1 kb mainly in adult and fetal neural tissues. A minor
transcript of about 8.4 kb was also detected in adult cerebral cortex
and fetal whole brain. Highest SLITRK2 expression was in adult cerebral
cortex.

GENE FUNCTION

By overexpression in murine pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma cell
lines, Aruga and Mikoshiba (2003) found that mouse Slitrk2 suppressed
neurite outgrowth, including cAMP-induced outgrowth. Mutation analysis
localized the inhibitory activity to the C-terminal intracellular domain
of Slitrk2. Slitrk2 lacking this domain induced neurite outgrowth, and
the isolated intracellular domain inhibited neuritogenesis, similar to
intact Slitrk2 protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Aruga et al. (2003) determined that the SLITRK2 gene contains 2 exons.
Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Aruga et al. (2003) mapped the SLITRK2
gene to a region of chromosome Xq27 that also contains the SLITRK4 gene
(300562). The intervening sequence between the SLITRK genes is about 2
Mb. Aruga et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Slitrk2 gene to a region of
chromosome XA5 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
Xq27.

123836	TITLE *123836 CYCLIN B1; CCNB1
;;CYCLIN B; CCNB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Pines and Hunter (1989) reported the nucleotide and predicted amino acid
sequence of a human B-type cyclin. The gene is expressed predominantly
in the G2/M phase of cell division. The gene product complexes with
p34(cdc2) to form mitosis-promoting factor (also known as
maturation-promoting factor or M phase-promoting factor), or MPF. By
genetic mapping in the mouse using human cyclin B1 probes, Lock et al.
(1992) identified 10 cyclin B1-related sequences located on chromosomes
4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, and 17. In Northern analysis, 3 cyclin
B1-related transcripts of 1.7, 2.1, and 2.7 kb were detected in
embryonic stem cells and postimplantation embryos from day 9.5 to 15.5
of development. The multiple cyclin B1-related sequences in the mouse
genome and the multiple cyclin B1 mRNAs raised the possibility that the
seemingly redundant cyclin B genes may have developmental- and/or
cell-type-specific functions.

GENE FUNCTION

In vertebrate cells, the nuclear entry of MPF during prophase is thought
to be essential for the induction and coordination of M-phase events.
Phosphorylation of cyclin B1 is central to its nuclear translocation.
Toyoshima-Morimoto et al. (2001) purified a protein kinase from Xenopus
M-phase extracts that phosphorylates a crucial serine residue (S147) in
the middle of the nuclear export signal sequence of cyclin B1. They
identified this kinase as Plx1, a Xenopus homolog of PLK1 (602098).
During cell cycle progression in HeLa cells, a change in the kinase
activity of endogenous PLK1 toward S147 and/or S133 correlated with a
kinase activity in the cell extracts. An anti-PLK1 antibody depleted the
M-phase extracts of the kinase activity toward S147 and/or S133. An
antiphospho-S147 antibody reacted specifically with cyclin B1 only
during G2/M phase. A mutant cyclin B1 in which S133 and S147 were
replaced by alanines remained in the cytoplasm, whereas wildtype cyclin
B1 accumulated in the nucleus during prophase. Coexpression of
constitutively active PLK1 stimulated nuclear entry of cyclin B1.
Toyoshima-Morimoto et al. (2001) concluded that PLK1 may be involved in
targeting MPF to the nucleus during prophase.

Tsukahara et al. (2010) isolated a fission yeast cyclin B mutant
defective specifically in chromosome biorientation. Accordingly,
Tsukahara et al. (2010) identified Cdk1 (116940)-cyclin B-dependent
phosphorylation of survivin (603352). Preventing survivin
phosphorylation impaired centromere chromosomal passenger complex (CPC)
targeting as well as chromosome biorientation, whereas phosphomimetic
survivin suppressed the biorientation defect in the cyclin B mutant.
Survivin phosphorylation promoted direct binding with shugoshin (see
609168), which Tsukahara et al. (2010) defined as a conserved
centromeric adaptor of the CPC. In human cells, the phosphorylation of
borealin (609977) has a comparable role. Tsukahara et al. (2010)
concluded that this study resolved the conserved mechanisms of CPC
targeting to centromeres, highlighting a key role of Cdk1-cyclin B in
chromosome biorientation.

MAPPING

Milatovich and Francke (1992) mapped the CCNB1 gene to 5q13-qter by
Southern blot analysis of human/Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrid
panels. Based on this information and known evolutionary conservation of
chromosomal regions, they proposed that the homologous cyclin B1 locus,
Cycb-4, on mouse chromosome 13 is a functional gene. Using cDNA isolated
by Pines and Hunter (1989) for fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Sartor et al. (1992) mapped the CCNB1 gene to 5q12.

ANIMAL MODEL

Two B-type cyclins, B1 and B2 (602755), have been identified in mammals.
Proliferating cells express both cyclins, which bind to and activate p34
(CDC2). To test whether the 2 B-type cyclins have distinct roles,
Brandeis et al. (1998) generated lines of transgenic mice, one lacking
cyclin B1 and the other lacking B2. Cyclin B1 proved to be an essential
gene; no homozygous B1-null pups were born. In contrast, nullizygous B2
mice developed normally and did not display any obvious abnormalities.
Both male and female cyclin B2-null mice were fertile, which was
unexpected in view of the high levels and distinct patterns of
expression of cyclin B2 during spermatogenesis. Brandeis et al. (1998)
showed that the expression of cyclin B1 overlaps the expression of
cyclin B2 in the mature testis, but not vice versa. Cyclin B1 can be
found both on intracellular membranes and free in the cytoplasm, in
contrast to cyclin B2, which is membrane-associated. These observations
suggested that cyclin B1 may compensate for the loss of cyclin B2 in the
mutant mice, and implies that cyclin B1 is capable of targeting the
p34(CDC2) kinase to the essential substrates of cyclin B2.

In higher eukaryotes, the S phase and M phase of the cell cycle are
triggered by different cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). For example, in
frog egg extracts, Cdk1 (116940)-cyclin B catalyzes entry into mitosis
but cannot trigger DNA replication. Two hypotheses can explain this
observation: either Cdk1-cyclin B fails to recognize the key substrates
of its S-phase-promoting counterparts, or its activity is somehow
regulated to prevent it from activating DNA synthesis. Moore et al.
(2003) demonstrated that Cdk1-cyclin B1 has cryptic S-phase-promoting
abilities that can be unmasked by relocating it from the cytoplasm to
the nucleus and moderately stimulating its activity with Cdc25
phosphatase (157680). Subcellular localization of vertebrate CDKs and
the control of their activity are thus critical factors for determining
their specificity.

Matsuo et al. (2003) studied the regenerating liver of mice and
demonstrated that the circadian clock controls expression of cell
cycle-related genes that in turn modulate the expression of active
cyclin B1-Cdc2 (116940) kinase, a key regulator of mitosis. Among these
genes, Matsuo et al. (2003) found that expression of Wee1 (193525) was
directly regulated by the molecular components of the circadian
clockwork. In contrast, the circadian clockwork oscillated independently
of the cell cycle in single cells. Matsuo et al. (2003) concluded that
the intracellular circadian clockwork can control the cell division
cycle directly and unidirectionally in proliferating cells.

611117	TITLE *611117 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE METHYLESTERASE 1; PPME1
;;PME1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Protein phosphatase methylesterase-1 catalyzes the demethylation of the
protein phosphatase-2A catalytic subunit (PPP2CA; 176915) (Ogris et al.,
1999).

CLONING

Using immunoprecipitation and characterization of stable protein
complexes formed with catalytically inactive PPP2CA mutants H59Q and
H118Q, Ogris et al. (1999) identified an approximately 44-kD
PPP2CA-associated protein and cloned the cDNA, designated PPME1, from
HeLa cell mRNA by RT-PCR. The deduced 386-amino acid protein shares 40%
and 26% sequence identity with the C. elegans and S. cerevisiae
homologs, respectively. Human PPME1 contains a highly charged stretch of
amino acids, and all 3 PPME1 homologs contain a consensus sequence for
lipases that use an active site serine.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis with wildtype and H59Q and H118Q mutant
PPP2CA, Ogris et al. (1999) showed that PPME1 forms a stable complex
with the catalytically inactive mutant subunits but not with the
wildtype subunit. Expression of PPME1 in bacteria demonstrated that
PPME1 has PPP2CA methylesterase activity that is inhibited by the PPP2CA
inhibitor okadaic acid but not by the serine protease inhibitor PMSF. By
coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Ogris et al. (1999) showed that the
PPP2CA inhibitors okadaic acid, sodium fluoride, and sodium
pyrophosphate decreased the association of PPME1 with the H59Q mutant.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PPME1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP RH11842).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Xing et al. (2008) reported the crystal structure at 2.1-angstrom
resolution of human PME1 by itself and in complex with a PP2A
heterodimeric core enzyme, which consists of PPP2CA and PPP2R1A
(605983). The structures revealed that PME1 directly binds to the active
site of PP2A and that this interaction results in the activation of PME1
by rearranging its catalytic triad residues into an active conformation.
This interaction also leads to inactivation of PP2A by evicting the
manganese ions required for the phosphatase activity of PP2A.

605196	TITLE *605196 COQ3, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; COQ3
;;METHYLTRANSFERASE COQ3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquinone, also known as coenzyme Q, or Q, is a critical component of
the electron transport pathways of both eukaryotes and prokaryotes
(Jonassen and Clarke, 2000). This lipid consists of a hydrophobic
isoprenoid tail and a quinone head group. The tail varies in length
depending on the organism, but its purpose is to anchor coenzyme Q to
the membrane. The quinone head group is responsible for the activity of
coenzyme Q in the respiratory chain. The S. cerevisiae COQ3 gene encodes
an O-methyltransferase required for 2 steps in the biosynthetic pathway
of coenzyme Q. This enzyme methylates an early coenzyme Q intermediate,
3,4-dihydroxy-5-polyprenylbenzoic acid, as well as the final
intermediate in the pathway, converting demethyl-ubiquinone to coenzyme
Q. The COQ3 gene product is also capable of methylating the distinct
prokaryotic early intermediate 2-hydroxy-6-polyprenyl phenol.

CLONING

By screening a human heart cDNA library with a rat Coq3 cDNA, Jonassen
and Clarke (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding human COQ3. The predicted
311-amino acid protein contains a putative N-terminal mitochondrial
targeting signal, and 4 regions that are conserved among
methyltransferase enzymes that utilize S-adenosylmethionine as a methyl
donor. The human COQ3 protein shares a great deal of sequence identity
with a variety of eukaryotic and prokaryotic COQ3 orthologs. The authors
demonstrated that recombinant human COQ3 can rescue the growth of yeast
coq3-null mutants on a nonfermentable carbon source, and can restore
coenzyme Q biosynthesis in these mutants, although at lower levels than
those exhibited by wildtype yeast. In in vitro methyltransferase assays
using farnesylated analogs of intermediates in the coenzyme Q
biosynthetic pathway as substrates, human COQ3 was active with all 3
substrates tested.

MAPPING

In a personal communication, Hirano (2006) noted that the COQ3 gene
resides on chromosome 6q16.3.

174761	TITLE *174761 POLYMERASE (DNA-DIRECTED), DELTA 1, CATALYTIC SUBUNIT; POLD1
;;POLYMERASE, DNA, DELTA; POLD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The POLD1 gene encodes the catalytic and proofreading subunit of DNA
polymerase-delta, which is responsible for DNA synthesis of the lagging
strand during DNA replication (summary by Palles et al., 2013 and Weedon
et al., 2013).

The DNA polymerase delta complex is involved in DNA replication and
repair, and it consists of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA;
176740), the multisubunit replication factor C (see 102579), and the 4
subunit polymerase complex: POLD1, POLD2 (600815), POLD3 (611415), and
POLD4 (611525) (Liu and Warbrick, 2006).

CLONING

Syvaoja et al. (1990) purified DNA polymerases alpha (312040), delta,
and epsilon (174762) from the same HeLa cell extract. The results of
their studies supported the premise that the alpha, delta, and epsilon
polymerases are distinct enzymes. PCNA is the auxiliary protein
(cofactor) for DNA polymerase delta. Syvaoja and Linn (1989) identified
a form of DNA polymerase delta in HeLa cells that is insensitive to
PCNA. Lee and Toomey (1987) isolated DNA polymerase delta from human
placenta and presented evidence that both its polymerase and its
exonuclease activities are associated with a single protein. Lee (1988)
concluded that the multiple forms of placenta DNA polymerase delta are
the result of proteolysis during isolation and that all derive from one
protein.

Chung et al. (1991) cloned cDNA corresponding to the POLD gene and
showed that the 3,443-bp sequence encodes a polypeptide of 1,107 amino
acids. The enzyme is 94% identical to bovine DNA polymerase delta and
contains the numerous highly conserved regions previously observed in
the bovine and yeast enzymes. The human enzyme also contains 2 putative
zinc finger domains in the C-terminal region of the molecule as well as
a putative nuclear localization signal at the N-terminal end.

Yang et al. (1992) also cloned human POLD cDNA and demonstrated that it
is 3.5 kb long and encodes a protein of 1,107 amino acids with a
calculated molecular mass of 124 kD. Northern blot analysis demonstrated
that the mRNA is 3.4 kb.

Weedon et al. (2013) found expression of the POLD1 gene across a panel
of human tissues, with high levels of expression in heart and lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Nishida et al. (1988) showed that DNA repair synthesis in human
fibroblasts requires DNA polymerase delta. Dresler et al. (1988) showed
that repair synthesis late after ultraviolet irradiation, like repair
synthesis at earlier stages, is mediated by this enzyme.

Kamath-Loeb et al. (2000) showed that WRN functionally interacts with
DNA polymerase delta, which is required for DNA replication and DNA
repair.

Lydeard et al. (2007) showed that in haploid budding yeast, Rad51
(179617)-dependent break-induced replication (BIR) induced by HO
endonuclease requires the lagging strand DNA polymerase alpha-primase
complex as well as polymerase delta to initiate new DNA synthesis.
Polymerase epsilon is not required for the initial primer extension step
of BIR but is required to complete 30 kb of new DNA synthesis.
Initiation of BIR also requires the nonessential DNA polymerase delta
subunit polymerase-32 primarily through its interaction with another
polymerase delta subunit, polymerase-31. HO-induced gene conversion, in
which both ends of a double-strand break engage in homologous
recombination, does not require polymerase-32. Polymerase-32 is also
required for the recovery of both Rad51-dependent and Rad51-independent
survivors in yeast strains lacking telomerase. The results of Lydeard et
al. (2007) strongly suggested that both types of telomere maintenance
pathways occur by recombination-dependent DNA replication. Thus,
polymerase-32, dispensable for replication and for gene conversion, is
uniquely required for BIR; this finding provided an opening into
understanding how DNA replication restart mechanisms operate in
eukaryotes.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of DNA from a panel of 24 human/hamster hybrid cells,
Chung et al. (1991) mapped the POLD gene to chromosome 19. Yang et al.
(1992) localized the POLD gene to chromosome 19 by Southern blotting of
EcoRI-digested DNA from a panel of rodent/human cell hybrids. By in situ
hybridization, Kemper et al. (1992) assigned the POLD1 gene to
19q13.3-q13.4.

Goldsby et al. (1998) mapped the Pold1 gene to mouse chromosome 7.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chang et al. (1995) showed that the human POLD1 gene contains 27 exons
spanning approximately 32 kb. The gene has a GC-rich promoter region and
multiple transcription start sites. Zhao and Chang (1997) found that the
core promoter of the POLD1 gene extends 328 bp upstream from the major
transcription start site. Multiple elements in this region, including
two 11-bp direct repeats, play an important role in POLD1 promoter
activity. Zhao and Chang (1997) showed that SP1 (189906) and SP3
(601804) can activate the POLD1 promoter through the direct repeat
sequences.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Susceptibility to Colorectal Cancer 10

In affected members of 2 large multigenerational families with
susceptibility to colorectal cancer-10 (CRCS10; 612591), Palles et al.
(2013) identified a heterozygous mutation in the POLD1 gene (S478N;
174761.0001) at a highly conserved residue in the exonuclease domain.
The S489N mutation was also identified in a third affected family in the
validation phase of the study. The phenotype was characterized by the
development of multiple colorectal adenomas and carcinomas early in
adult life. However, 7 mutation carriers also developed endometrial
carcinoma, and 1 patient had 2 primary brain tumors. Tumor tissue from 2
of 6 mutation carriers showed additional somatic mutations, most
commonly in the APC (611731), KRAS (190070), or FBXW7 (606278) genes.
All tumors showed microsatellite stability. In addition to germline
POLD1 mutations, Palles et al. (2013) identified somatic POLE mutations
in 5 colorectal cancers from a large database. All of these tumors had
additional somatic mutations. These findings suggested that the
mechanism of tumorigenesis in POLD1-mutated tumors is decreased fidelity
of replication-associated polymerase proofreading, leading to an
increased mutation rate.

- Mandibular Hypoplasia, Deafness, Progeroid Features, and
Lipodystrophy Syndrome

In 4 unrelated patients with mandibular hypoplasia, deafness, progeroid
features, and lipodystrophy syndrome (MDPL; 615381), Weedon et al.
(2013) identified a de novo heterozygous in-frame deletion of residue
ser605 (ser604del) in the polymerase active site of the POLD1 gene
(174761.0003). The mutation, which was initially found by exome
sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing in 2 of the patients, was
not found in any of the parents or in several large control databases.
The disorder was characterized by loss of subcutaneous fat in early
childhood, a characteristic facial appearance, and metabolic
abnormalities including insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus.
Sensorineural deafness occurred late in the first or second decades of
life. In vitro functional expression studies in E. coli showed that the
mutant enzyme had lost its DNA polymerase ability, whereas its
exonuclease activity, although decreased compared to wildtype, was still
present. The studies demonstrated decoupling of the mutant enzyme's
activities and suggested that the mutant protein could bind DNA, but was
unable to interact with and incorporate dNTPs. The mutations causing
colorectal cancer (174761.0001 and 174761.0002) affect the proofreading
domain and lead to increased base-substitution error rates, whereas the
ser605del mutant enzyme retains proofreading ability but cannot catalyze
polymerization, which likely leads to an increase in stalled replication
forks, cell senescence, and death. The findings implicated POLD1 in
adipose tissue homeostasis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Normal cells minimize spontaneous mutations through the combined actions
of polymerase base selectivity, 3-prime to 5-prime exonucleolytic
proofreading, mismatch correction, and DNA damage repair. To determine
the consequences of defective proofreading in mammals, Goldsby et al.
(2002) generated mice with a point mutation (asp400 to ala) in the
proofreading domain of DNA polymerase delta. They showed that this
mutation inactivates the 3-prime to 5-prime exonuclease of DNA
polymerase delta and causes a mutator and cancer phenotype in a
recessive manner. By 18 months of age, 94% of mice homozygous for the
mutation developed cancer and died (median survival, 10 months). In
contrast, only 3 to 4% of heterozygotes and wildtype homozygotes
developed cancer in this time frame. Of the 66 tumors arising in 49
homozygous mice, 40 were epithelial in origin (carcinomas), 24 were
mesenchymal (lymphomas and sarcomas), and 2 were composite (teratomas);
one-third of these animals developed tumors in more than 1 tissue. Skin
squamous cell carcinoma was the most common tumor type, occurring in 60%
of all homozygous mice and in 90% of those surviving beyond 8 months of
age. These data showed that DNA polymerase delta proofreading suppresses
spontaneous tumor development and strongly suggested that unrepaired DNA
polymerase errors contribute to carcinogenesis.

COLORECTAL CANCER, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 10
POLD1, SER478ASN

In affected members of 2 large multigenerational families with
susceptibility to colorectal cancer-10 (CRCS10; 612591), Palles et al.
(2013) identified a heterozygous 1433G-A transition in the POLD1 gene,
resulting in a ser478-to-asn (S478N) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in the exonuclease domain. The mutant mRNA was stably expressed.
Microsatellite analysis of the 2 families suggested a common ancestor.
The S489N mutation was identified in a third affected family in the
validation phase of the study. The mutation, which was initially
identified by linkage analysis combined with whole-genome sequencing,
was not found in 6,721 controls or 10,755 control exomes. A yeast
construct carrying the analogous mutation showed a 12-fold higher
mutation rate compared to wildtype. Molecular modeling using yeast
structures indicated that the S478N mutation will distort the packing of
helices involved at the exonuclease active site, likely affecting
nuclear activity. The phenotype was characterized by the development of
multiple colorectal adenomas and carcinomas early in adult life.
However, 7 mutation carriers also developed endometrial carcinoma, and 1
patient had 2 primary brain tumors. Tumor tissue from 2 of 6 mutation
carriers showed additional somatic mutations, most commonly in the APC
(611731), KRAS (190070), or FBXW7 (606278) genes. All tumors showed

(2013) identified a de novo heterozygous in-frame 3-bp deletion
(c.1812_1814delCTC) in the POLD1 gene, resulting in the deletion of
residue ser605 (ser605del) in motif A, a highly conserved region of the
polymerase active site. The mutation, which was initially found by exome
sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing in 2 of the patients, was
not found in any of the parents or in several large control databases.
In vitro functional expression studies in E. coli showed that the mutant

607430	TITLE *607430 DAZ-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; DAZAP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human testis cDNA library with the
coding region of DAZ (400003) as bait, Tsui et al. (2000) cloned cDNAs
encoding DAZAP1 and DAZAP2 (607431). DAZAP1 is an RNA-binding protein of
407 amino acids. It contains 2 RNP motifs in the N terminus and has a
proline-rich C terminus. The protein shares high sequence homology in
the RNP regions with hnRNP A/B proteins (see 600124), but differs from
these proteins in the C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected
expression of 2 DAZAP1 transcripts of 2.75 and 2.4 kb that were most
abundant in the testis and to a lesser degree in the thymus. All other
tissues expressed low levels of the transcript. RT-PCR of RNA samples
from testicular biopsies of 4 infertile men detected expression of
DAZAP1 only in samples with normal spermatogenesis, suggesting that
DAZAP1 is expressed mainly in the germ cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using GST-fusion binding analysis, Tsui et al. (2000) determined that
both DAZAP1 and DAZAP2 interact with DAZ and DAZL (601486). Deletion
constructs indicated that DAZ and DAZL bind to DAZAP1/DAZAP2 mainly
through the DAZ repeat region.

MAPPING

By FISH, Tsui et al. (2000) mapped the DAZAP1 gene to chromosome
19p13.3.

(2000) obtained a cDNA encoding ABCA7. The deduced 2,146-amino acid
protein contains 2 highly conserved ATP-binding cassettes with Walker A
and B motifs and signature sequences. ABCA7 shares closest homology with
ABC subfamily A members. Northern dot blot analysis demonstrated
predominant expression in myelolymphatic tissues. Flow cytometric
analysis of permeabilized leukocytes revealed greatest expression in
monocytes, followed by granulocytes and lymphocytes.

Broccardo et al. (2001) cloned human and mouse ABCA7 cDNAs and
determined that the deduced proteins share 79% sequence identity.
Northern blot analysis showed that mouse Abca7 is widely expressed both
during embryogenesis and in adult tissues; the highest level of
transcription is detectable in the spleen and hematopoietic tissues. The
same pattern of expression was found in human tissues, with a strong
signal also detected in fetal liver.

Tanaka et al. (2001) observed identity between residues 195 and 352 of
ABCA7 and a Sjogren syndrome autoantigen. They determined that ABCA7
encodes the autoantigen SS-N.

GENE FUNCTION

By RT-PCR and Western blot analysis of differentiated monocytes,
Kaminski et al. (2000) found increased expression of ABCA7 after
addition of low density lipoprotein and decreased expression after
deloading of macrophages with high density lipoprotein. Therefore,
ABCA7, like ABCA1 (600046) and ABCG1 (603076), exhibits a regulatory
response to cholesterol influx and efflux.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kaminski et al. (2000) determined that the ABCA7 gene contains 46 exons
and spans about 32 kb. Analysis of the promoter region revealed binding
sites for transcription factors with roles in hematopoiesis and
cholesterol metabolism. They also determined that the terminal exon of
ABCA7 is separated from the 5-prime end of the coding region of the
minor histocompatibility antigen HA-1 (601155) by about 1.7 kb.

MAPPING

Kaminski et al. (2000) identified ABCA7 in tandem with HA-1, which
shares sequence identity with a BAC clone mapped to chromosome 19p13.3.

By FISH and radiation hybrid analysis, Broccardo et al. (2001) mapped
the human ABCA7 gene to chromosome 19p13.3 and the mouse counterpart to
a region of syntenic homology on chromosome 10.

605536	TITLE *605536 RAB11 FAMILY-INTERACTING PROTEIN 5; RAB11FIP5
;;RAB11-INTERACTING PROTEIN; RIP11;;
KIAA0857
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

RAB11 (see RAB11A; 605570) is a GTPase that regulates endosomal
trafficking to apical plasma membrane domains in polarized epithelial
cells. Using protein purification and microsequence analysis, Prekeris
et al. (2000) identified a novel RAB11 effector, which they called
RIP11. RIP11 is identical to the KIAA0857 open reading frame (Nagase et
al., 1998), which encodes a 653-amino acid protein. Northern blot
analysis detected 2 major RIP11 transcripts of 4.4 and 6 kb. Both
transcripts were enriched in kidney, while other tissues expressed
reduced levels of RIP11. Antibodies recognized a protein doublet of 72
kD. RIP11 was found to be enriched in polarized epithelial cells where,
like Rab11, it localized to subapical recycling endosomes (AREs) and the
apical plasma membrane.

By immunofluorescence microscopy of HeLa cells, Hales et al. (2001)
demonstrated that endogenous RIP11 colocalized with RAB11FIP1 (608737),
RAB11FIP2 (608599), and RAB11A. Confocal immunofluorescent microscopy
indicated colocalization in the apical region of canine kidney cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using transport assays, Prekeris et al. (2000) demonstrated that RIP11
is important for protein trafficking from AREs to the apical plasma
membrane. RIP11 is recruited to AREs by binding to RAB11, as well as
through a Mg(2+)-dependent interaction of its C2 domain with neutral
phospholipids. The association of RIP11 with membranes is regulated by a
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cycle. Prekeris et al. (2000)
proposed a model whereby the RAB11/RIP11 complex regulates vesicle
targeting from the ARE.

Hales et al. (2001) determined that RIP11 interacted with RAB11A, a
constitutively active form of RAB11A, RAB11B (604198), and RAB25
(612942). Rip11, Rab11fip1, and Rab11fip2 coenriched with Rab11a and
H(+)K(+)-ATPase (see 137217) on rabbit parietal cell tubulovesicles.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the RAB11FIP5
gene, which they identified as KIAA0857, to chromosome 2.

151350	TITLE *151350 LEUCYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE; LARS
;;LRS;;
LARS1;;
LEUS;;
RNTLS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By study of hybrids of Chinese hamster and human cells, Giles et al.
(1980) found evidence that a structural gene for leucyl-tRNA synthetase
is on chromosome 5.

GENE FUNCTION

The aminoacyl-tRNA synthases catalyze ligation of amino acids to their
respective transfer RNAs. Han et al. (2012) showed that LRS senses
intracellular leucine concentration and interacts directly with Rag
GTPase (RRAGD; 608268). RRAGD then activates MTORC1 (601231), a key
regulator of growth. When the authors modified the LRS protein to
inhibit leucine binding, they observed a loss of amino acid regulation
signaling to mTORC1.

MAPPING

Dana and Wasmuth (1982) did cytogenetic and biochemical analyses of
spontaneous segregants from Chinese hamster-human interspecific hybrid
cells that contained human chromosome 5 and expressed the 4 syntenic
genes LEUS, HEXB (606873), EMTB (130620), and CHR (118840), the hybrid
cells being subjected to selective conditions requiring them to retain
the LEUS gene. From these analyses, Dana and Wasmuth (1982) concluded
that the order is as listed above and that the specific locations are:
LEUS, 5pter-5q1; HEXB, 5q13; EMTB, 5q23-5q35; CHR, 5q35. Gerken et al.
(1986) stated that LARS is located in 5cen-q11 and that threonyl-tRNA
synthetase (187790) is closely linked, at 5p13-cen.

NOMENCLATURE

Following the system used for isoenzymes encoded by nuclear genes, in
which 1 is used to designate the cytoplasmic or soluble form and 2 is
used to designate the mitochondrial form (e.g., SOD1 (147450) and SOD2
(147460)), cytoplasmic LARS might be referred to as LARS1, and the
mitochondrial form as LARS2 (604544).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a 4-generation family of Irish Travellers segregating infantile liver
failure (615438), Casey et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for 2
missense mutations in the LARS gene. One (Y373C; 151350.0001) was a
mutation at a conserved residue in the connective peptide-1 (CP1)
domain. The other was predicted to be a rare nonpathogenic variant.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NFANTILE LIVER FAILURE SYNDROME 1 (1 family)
LARS, TYR373CYS

In 6 affected individuals from a consanguineous Irish Traveller family
with infantile syndromic liver failure (615438), Casey et al (2012)
identified homozygosity for an A-to-G transversion at nucleotide 1118
(c.1118A-G) in exon 11 of the LARS gene, leading to a
tyrosine-to-cysteine substitution at codon 373 (Y373C). The Y373C
mutation was predicted to be highly deleterious, was highly conserved
across eukaryotic species (89%), and was not present in 186 control
chromosomes nor had been reported as a common polymorphic variant in
dbSNP or the 1000 Genomes project. All affected individuals were also
homozygous for a second mutation in cis, an A-to-G transition at
nucleotide 245 in exon 4 resulting in a lysine-to-arginine substitution
at codon 82 (K82R; dbSNP rs112954500), which was predicted to be a rare
nonpathogenic variant and was seen in in 2.1 percent (1/48 alleles) of
Irish controls but in no (0/138 alleles) Irish Travellers. All
unaffected individuals of the family were either homozygous wildtype or
heterozygous for the mutations. The Y373C mutation is located within the
editing domain of LARS, known as connective peptide-1 (CP1), and was
predicted to destabilize the protein structure. LARS knockdown achieved
by siRNA in HEK293 cells had no effect on mitochondrial function even
when cells were under physiologic stress.

614277	TITLE *614277 UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME 2W; UBE2W
;;UBC16, ARABIDOPSIS, HOMOLOG OF; UBC16
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitination is a common posttranslational modification that plays
roles in many cellular pathways and in protein degradation. Conjugation
of ubiquitin to substrate proteins requires an E1 ubiquitin-activating
enzyme (e.g., UBE1; 314370), an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (e.g.,
UBE2A; 312180), and an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (e.g., UBE3A;
601623). UBE2W is an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (summary by Zhang
et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a human fetal brain cDNA library, Yin
et al. (2006) cloned UBE2W, which they called UBC16. The deduced
162-amino acid protein has an approximately 150-amino acid catalytic
core, termed the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC) domain, which
contains 2 nuclear localization signals at its C-terminal end. Human
UBC16 shares 51% amino acid identity with Arabidopsis Ubc16. RT-PCR
detected ubiquitous UBC16 expression, with highest expression in heart,
brain, liver, and pancreas. Fluorescence-tagged UBC16 localized to
nuclei of transfected HEK293 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By mutation analysis, Yin et al. (2006) showed that nuclear localization
of human UBC in transfected HEK293 cells required both the nuclear
localization signals and enzyme activity.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Zhang et al. (2011) showed that mouse
Ube2w interacted with Fancl (608111), an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in
DNA damage repair. They confirmed the interaction by protein pull-down
and coimmunoprecipitation analyses. Fancl showed a ubiquitous
intracellular localization in the absence of Ube2w and a nuclear
localization in the presence of Ube2w. Ube2w formed nuclear homodimers.
Ube2w exhibited ubiquitin-conjugating activity and monoubiquitinated the
PHD domain of Fancl in vitro. Ubiquitination by Ube2w required a
conserved active-site cysteine within its ubiquitin-conjugating domain.
Ube2w also monoubiquitinated Fancd2 (613984). Downregulation of UBE2W in
human cell lines markedly reduced FANCD2 monoubiquitination caused by
ultraviolet irradiation, but not FANCD2 monoubiquitination caused by the
DNA crosslinking agent mitomycin C or FANCD2 monoubiquitination that
occurs normally during S phase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yin et al. (2006) determined that the UBE2W gene contains 7 exons and
spans 8.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Yin et al. (2006) mapped the UBE2W gene to
chromosome 8q13-q21.1.

602415	TITLE *602415 DYSTROBREVIN, BETA; DTNB
DESCRIPTION Dystrophin, a component of muscle that is defective in Duchenne muscular
dystrophy (DMD; 310200), binds to a complex of proteins and
glycoproteins, the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DPC), which
effectively forms a transmembrane link between the extracellular matrix,
and the cytoskeleton of the muscle fiber. The DPC can be divided into 3
subcomplexes: the dystroglycan complex, the sarcoglycan complex, and the
cytoplasmic complex. The dystroglycan complex consists of 2 proteins,
alpha- and beta-dystroglycan (DAG1, DAG2;128239), that bind to laminin
and dystrophin, respectively. The sarcoglycan complex is composed of 4
transmembrane glycoproteins: alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and
delta-sarcoglycan, and a 25-kD protein 25DAP. Mutations in all 4
sarcoglycan genes have been found in patients with different forms of
limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. The cytoplasmic component of the DPC is
composed of the syntrophin family of related proteins and the
dystrophin-related protein, dystrobrevin. Peters et al. (1997) described
beta-dystrobrevin. They cloned cDNAs from human liver libraries that
encode a 627-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of
71 kD. The protein copurified with the dystrobrevin short form, Dp71.

The mammalian dystrobrevin genes encode several protein isoforms that
are expressed in different tissues, including brain and muscle. Blake et
al. (1998) designated the isoform expressed in muscle as
alpha-dystrobrevin and used the designation beta-dystrobrevin for the
dystrophin-related protein they found to be abundantly expressed in
brain and other tissues but not in muscle. Beta-dystrobrevin is encoded
by a 2.5-kb alternatively spliced transcript that is found throughout
the brain. In common with dystrophin, beta-dystrobrevin is found in
neurons of the cortex and hippocampal formation, but it is not found in
the brain microvasculature. In the brain, beta-dystrobrevin
coprecipitates with the dystrophin isoforms Dp71 and Dp140. The findings
of Blake et al. (1998) indicated that the composition of the
dystrophin-associated protein complex in the brain differs from that in
muscle. Because beta-dystrobrevin and dystrophin are expressed in
similar populations of neurons in the hippocampus and cortex, it is
possible that beta-dystrobrevin interacts directly with dystrophin. If
this is the case, then beta-dystrobrevin levels may be reduced in DMD
patients similar to the reduction in sarcolemmal staining seen with
other components of the DPC in dystrophic muscle. The findings may be
relevant to the cognitive dysfunction affecting many patients with
Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Peters et al. (1997) mapped the
DTNB gene to human 2p23-p22. The short arm of human chromosome 2 shows
homology of synteny with the most proximal 15 cM of mouse chromosome 12.
Loh et al. (1998) assigned the mouse beta-dystrobrevin gene (Dtnb) to
chromosome 12 by backcross mapping. They found that the mouse gene
contains 21 exons spanning over 130 kb of DNA.

608729	TITLE *608729 ANGIOTENSIN II RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; AGTRAP
;;ATRAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the C-terminal domain of murine At2r1a (106165) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen, Daviet et al. (1999) cloned mouse Agtrap from a kidney
cDNA library. The deduced 161-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 17.8 kD. It contains several extensive N-terminal
hydrophobic domains, as well as potential sites for phosphorylation and
N-glycosylation. Northern blot analysis detected transcripts of 1.2 and
0.8 kb in all mouse tissues examined, with relatively high levels in
kidney, testis, and heart. PCR also detected Agtrap expression in mouse
aortic tissue and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).

By sequencing clones obtained from a fetal brain cDNA library, followed
by EST database analysis, Wang et al. (2002) cloned human AGTRAP. The
deduced 159-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 17.3
kD. AGTRAP has a 21-amino acid N-terminal transmembrane region that is
followed by a conserved cysteine, which is potentially palmitoylated.
Mouse and human AGTRAP share 74% amino acid homology. Northern blot
analysis detected a 1.2-kb transcript in almost all tissues examined,
with highest abundance in kidney, heart, pancreas, and thyroid.

GENE FUNCTION

By affinity chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Daviet
et al. (1999) confirmed association between mouse Agtrap and At2r1a.
Agtrap interacted specifically with the C-terminal domain of At2r1a, but
not with the C-terminal domains of several other hormone receptors,
including AT2R2 (300034), CHRM3 (118494), BDKRB2 (113503), EDNRB
(131244), and ADRB2 (109690). Overexpression of Agtrap in COS-7 cells
inhibited At2r1a activation of phospholipase C (see 607120). It did not
affect Chrm3 activation.

Cui et al. (2000) determined that transfection of mouse Agtrap into
adult rat VSMCs potentiated At2r1 internalization upon angiotensin II
(see 106150) stimulation. Receptor-induced DNA synthesis was inhibited
in Agtrap-transfected VSMCs, and this was associated with inhibition of
Stat3 (102582) and Akt (see 164730) phosphorylation. Cui et al. (2000)
concluded that AGTRAP is a negative regulator of AT2R1-mediated cell
proliferation in VSMCs.

Using several assays of protein interaction, Wang et al. (2002) showed
that AGTRAP interacted with RACK1 (176981). They suggested that the
AGTRAP-RACK1 interaction may help recruit the signaling complex to AT2R1
and affect receptor signaling.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Guo et al. (2005) demonstrated that mouse
Caml (CAMLG; 601118) interacted with Atrap. The N-terminal hydrophilic
domain of Caml mediated the interaction, and the proteins colocalized in
the endoplasmic reticulum. Atrap knockdown increased NFAT (see NFATC2;
600490) activity, and overexpression of Atrap decreased angiotensin II-
or Caml-induced NFAT transcriptional activation. Overexpression of the
N-terminal ATRAP-interacting domain of Caml increased angiotensin
II-induced NFAT promoter activity, whereas overexpression of the
C-terminal end of Caml disrupted the effect of angiotensin II on NFAT
signaling.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the AGTRAP
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SHGC-32094).

605712	TITLE *605712 SERINE PALMITOYLTRANSFERASE, LONG-CHAIN BASE SUBUNIT 1; SPTLC1
;;SPT1;;
LCB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT; EC 2.3.1.50) is the key enzyme in
sphingolipid biosynthesis. It catalyzes the first and rate-limiting
step: the pyridoxal-5-prime-phosphate-dependent condensation of L-serine
and palmitoyl-CoA to 3-oxosphinganine (Weiss and Stoffel, 1997).

SPT contains 2 main subunits: the common SPTLC1 subunit and either
SPTLC2 (605713) or its isoform SPTLC2L (SPTLC3; 611120), depending on
the tissue in which biosynthesis occurs (Hornemann et al., 2006). There
are also 2 highly related isoforms of a third subunit, SSSPTA (613540)
and SSSPTB (610412), that confer acyl-CoA preference of the SPT enzyme
and are essential for maximal enzyme activity (Han et al., 2009).

CLONING

Weiss and Stoffel (1997) cloned and characterized 2 complete human and
murine cDNA sequences corresponding to the SPTLC1 and SPTLC2 (605713)
genes, similar to yeast LCB1 and LCB2 genes, respectively. The SPTLC1
cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1,422 nucleotides and encodes a
473-amino acid protein (Bejaoui et al., 2001). By Northern blot
analysis, Dawkins et al. (2001) detected a single 3-kb SPTLC1 transcript
in all 7 tissues tested, including spinal cord. A search of the UniGene
database identified corresponding cDNA clones expressed in 29 different
tissues, indicating that SPTLC1 is ubiquitously expressed.

By quantitative real-time PCR analysis, Hornemann et al. (2006) detected
SPTLC1 expression in all 24 human tissues examined except for small
intestine. Western blot analysis detected SPTLC1 at 55 kD.
Overexpression of SPTLC1 in HEK293 cells showed no increase in SPT
activity, suggesting that SPTLC2 and SPTLC3 (611120) are the limiting
factors for SPT activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dawkins et al. (2001) determined that the SPTLC1 gene contains 15 exons
and established the intron/exon boundaries.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SPTLC1
gene to chromosome 9 (TMAP WI-8025). Dawkins et al. (2001) noted that
the SPTLC1 gene maps to chromosome 9q22.1-q22.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Dawkins et al. (2001) identified mutations in SPTLC1 in 11 families with
hereditary sensory neuropathy type I (HSN1; 162400). One family carried
a C133Y mutation in exon 5 (605712.0001); 8 families carried a C133W
mutation in exon 5 (605712.0002); and 2 families carried a V144D
mutation in exon 6 (605712.0003). All 6 families with definite or
probable linkage to chromosome 9 were found to have mutations in SPTLC1.
The families were of Australian/English, Australian/Scottish, English,
Austrian/German, or Canadian extraction. Dawkins et al. (2001) noted
that ceramide produced by catabolism of sphingomyelin mediates
programmed cell death and that increased de novo ceramide synthesis due
to an increase in SPT activity has been demonstrated to cause apoptosis
in a number of tissues (Perry et al., 2000), including differentiating
neuronal cells (Herget et al., 2000). Dawkins et al. (2001) determined
that the mutations were associated with increased de novo glucosyl
ceramide synthesis in lymphoblast cell lines in affected individuals.
Increased de novo ceramide synthesis triggers apoptosis, and is
associated with massive cell death during neural tube closure, raising
the possibility that neural degeneration in HSN1 is due to
ceramide-induced apoptotic cell death. Dawkins et al. (2001) labeled
lipids with C14-serine and showed that lymphoblast lines from HSN1
patients synthesize higher levels of glucosyl ceramide than do
comparable lines from healthy controls. Glucosyl ceramide synthesis in 5
HSN1 patients was 175% of the levels in 8 controls.

Bejaoui et al. (2001) independently identified the C133Y and C133W
mutations in 2 unrelated families with HSN1. Bejaoui et al. (2002) found
that the C133Y and C133W mutations do not alter the steady state levels
of the SPTLC1 or the SPTLC2 subunit. They did, however, result in
reduced SPT activity and sphingolipid synthesis. The mutations did not
complement the SPT deficiency found in a mutant CHO cell strain with
defective SPT activity secondary to a lack of SPTLC1. Overproduction of
either the C133Y or C133W subunit inhibited SPT activity in CHO cells
despite the presence of wildtype SPTLC1. The mutant SPTLC1 proteins
could also interact with the wildtype SPTLC2 subunit. The results
indicated that both of these mutations have a dominant-negative effect
on the SPT enzyme.

By in vitro functional expression assays in HEK293 cells, Hornemann et
al. (2009) found that none of the 4 SPTLC1 mutations, C133Y, C133W,
V144D, or G387A (605712.0004), interfered with formation of the SPT
complex. The first 3 mutant proteins resulted in 40 to 50% decreased SPT
activity, but the G387A protein showed no effect on SPT activity.
Further studies showed that the G387A protein could rescue a
SPTLC1-deficient cell line. Hornemann et al. (2009) also identified
homozygosity for the G387A variant in an unaffected mother of a
heterozygous carrier with HSN1, and it was found in 1 of 190 controls.
These findings indicated that G387A is not pathogenic. Hornemann et al.
(2009) postulated that the G387A variant, and perhaps the other 3 SPTLC1
variants previously associated with HSN1, may not be directly
disease-causing, but rather have an indirect or bystander effect by
increasing the risk for HSN1 in conjunction with another mutation.

SPT catalyzes the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA, the initial
step in the de novo synthesis of sphingolipids. Penno et al. (2010)
showed that HSAN1A-related mutations in the SPTLC1 gene induce a shift
in the substrate specificity of SPT, which leads to the formation of 2
atypical deoxysphingoid bases: 1-deoxysphinganine from condensation with
alanine, and 1-deoxymethylsphinganine from condensation with glycine.
Neither of these metabolites can be converted to complex sphingolipids
or degraded, resulting in their intracellular accumulation. These
atypical agents showed pronounced neurotoxic effects on neurite
formation in cultured sensory neurons, and was associated with disturbed
neurofilament structure. Penno et al. (2010) found increased levels of
these atypical agents in lymphoblasts and plasma from HSAN1A patients
with different SPTLC1 mutations. The findings indicated that HSAN1
results from gain-of-function mutations that cause the formation of
atypical and neurotoxic sphingolipid metabolites, rather than from lack
of de novo sphingolipid synthesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

McCampbell et al. (2005) created transgenic mouse lines that
ubiquitously overexpressed either wildtype or C133W-mutant SPTLC1. The
C133W-mutant mice developed age-dependent weight loss and mild sensory
and motor impairments. Aged C133W-mutant mice lost large myelinated
axons in the ventral root of the spinal cord and demonstrated myelin
thinning. There was also a loss of large myelinated axons in the dorsal
roots, although the unmyelinated fibers were preserved. In the dorsal
root ganglia, IB4 staining was diminished, whereas expression of the
injury-induced transcription factor ATF3 (603148) was increased.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE I
SPTLC1, CYS133TYR

In a family of Austrian/German origin with HSN1 (162400), Dawkins et al.
(2001) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 398 in exon 5 of the
SPTLC1 gene resulting in a cys133-to-tyr (C133Y) substitution.
Cysteine-133 of SPTLC1 is invariant in human, mouse, Drosophila, and
yeast. This mutation was also identified by Bejaoui et al. (2001) in a
family of German origin.

.0002
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE I
SPTLC1, CYS133TRP

In 8 families of Australian/English, Australian/Scottish, English, or
Canadian extraction with HSN1 (162400), Dawkins et al. (2001) identified
a T-to-G transversion at nucleotide 399 in exon 5 of the SPTLC1 gene,
resulting in a cysteine-to-tryptophan substitution at codon 133 (C133W).
Cysteine-133 of SPTLC1 is invariant in human, mouse, Drosophila, and
yeast. In a family of Canadian origin, Bejaoui et al. (2001)
independently identified this mutation.

Nicholson et al. (2001) performed haplotype analysis on 3 Australian
families of English extraction and 3 English families (2 of which had
been described elsewhere) with the cys133-to-trp mutation and
demonstrated the same chromosome 9 haplotype as well as the same
phenotype in all. They suggested that these families may have had a
common founder who, on the basis of historical information, lived in
southern England before 1800. The phenotype caused by the 399T-G SPTLC1
mutation is the same as that in the families reported by Campbell and
Hoffman (1964) and possibly the original family reported by Hicks
(1922), all of which were English.

In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and yeast, Gable et al. (2010)
demonstrated that the C133W-mutant protein was expressed and formed a
stable heterodimer with SPTLC2 (605713), but did not confer catalytic
SPT activity even when cotransfected with wildtype SPTLC1, thus showing
a dominant-negative effect. Coexpression of the mutant protein with the
catalytic enhancers SSSPTB (610412) and SSSPTA (613540) provided
sufficient SPT activity to support growth in yeast, although total
enzyme activity was only 10 to 20% of wildtype. Yeast and CHO cells
expressing the C133W mutant along with SPTLC2 and SSSPTA or SSSPTB
showed preferential condensation of palmitoyl-CoA to alanine rather than
serine. These results were not found with wildtype SPTLC1. Kinetic
studies showed that the mutant protein had the same affinity to serine
as the wildtype protein, but a lower Vmax for serine. These findings
suggest that the C133W mutation perturbs the active site of the protein,
facilitating the formation of alanine condensation products. However,
small increases in extracellular serine levels were able to inhibit the
reaction with alanine. The palmitoyl-CoA/alanine product,
1-deoxysphinganine (1-deoxySa), was shown to increase endoplasmic
reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response, which may ultimately
be toxic to neurons.

.0003
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE I
SPTLC1, VAL144ASP

In 2 families of Australian/Scottish and Australian/English extraction
with HSN1 (162400), Dawkins et al. (2001) identified a T-to-A
transversion at nucleotide 431 in exon 6 of the SPTLC1 gene, resulting
in a valine-to-aspartic acid substitution at codon 144 (V144D).
Valine-144 of SPTLC1 is conserved in human, mouse, Drosophila, and
yeast.

.0004
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE I
SPTLC1, GLY387ALA

In twin sisters with HSN1 (162400) from a Belgian family originally
reported by Montanini (1958), Verhoeven et al. (2004) identified a
1160G-C transversion in exon 13 of the SPTLC1 gene, resulting in a
gly387-to-ala (G387A) substitution. The mutation was not identified in
300 control chromosomes.

By in vitro functional studies, Hornemann et al. (2009) demonstrated
that overexpression of the G387A protein did not decrease SPT activity.
In addition, expression of the G387A protein could rescue a
SPTLC1-deficient cell line. Finally, homozygosity for G387A was
identified in an unaffected mother of a heterozygous G387A mutation
carrier with HSN1. The variant was also found in 1 of 190 unrelated
controls. All of these findings indicated that it is likely not
pathogenic. Hornemann et al. (2009) postulated that the G387A variant,
and perhaps the other 3 SPTLC1 variants previously associated with HSN1,
may not be directly disease-causing, but rather have an indirect or
bystander effect by increasing the risk for HSN1 in conjunction with
another mutation.

.0005
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY AND AUTONOMIC, TYPE I, SEVERE
SPTLC1, SER331PHE

In a French Gypsy with HSAN1 (162400), Rotthier et al. (2009) identified
a de novo heterozygous 992C-T transition in the SPTLC1 gene, resulting
in a ser331-to-phe (S331F) substitution in a conserved residue. The
patient had an unusually severe phenotype, with congenital onset,
insensitivity to pain with eschar and foot ulceration, pes
cavus/equinovarus, vocal cord paralysis, and gastroesophageal reflux.
The patient also had severe growth and mental retardation, microcephaly,
hypotonia, amyotrophy, and respiratory insufficiency. Nerve conduction
studies showed absent sensory and motor responses in the upper and lower
limbs. The mutation was absent from 600 control chromosomes. The
phenotype expanded the clinical spectrum of HSAN1.

.0006
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE I
SPTLC1, ALA352VAL

In an Austrian patient with HSN1 (162400), Rotthier et al. (2009)
identified a heterozygous 1055C-T transition in the SPTLC1 gene,
resulting in an ala352-to-val (A352V) substitution. The patient had
onset at age 16 years of severe sensory loss of the lower extremities
with peroneal atrophy and decreased distal reflexes. There was mild pes
cavus and lancinating pain in the lower extremities. DNA from family
members was not available.

606000	TITLE *606000 BUTYROPHILIN-LIKE PROTEIN 2; BTNL2
;;BUTYROPHILIN-LIKE PROTEIN, MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX CLASS
II-ASSOCIATED;;
BTL II
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Stammers et al. (2000) identified BTNL2, a member of the immunoglobulin
gene superfamily with homology to butyrophilin genes (e.g., BTN1A1;
601610). The BTNL2 protein contains a small hydrophobic sequence that
may be a signal peptide, 2 immunoglobulin domains, a 7-amino acid heptad
repeat, and 2 more immunoglobulin domains. Unlike other butyrophilins,
BTNL2 lacks a C-terminal B30-2 domain. RT-PCR analysis detected Btnl2
expression in mouse skeletal muscle, duodenum, ileum, cecum, ascending
colon, descending colon, and appendix.

Nguyen et al. (2006) characterized mouse Btnl2 and noted its homology
with B7 proteins (e.g., CD80; 112203). Real-time PCR showed highest
expression of Btnl2 in mouse intestine and lymphoid tissues. PCR of
immune cells detected Btnl2 expression in T cells, B cells, and
macrophages.

GENE FUNCTION

Nguyen et al. (2006) found that a putative receptor for mouse Btnl2,
distinct from Cd28 (186760) and Ctla4 (123890), was expressed on
activated B and T cells. Btnl2 appeared to regulate T-cell activation, a
finding with implications for the role of BTNL2 in inflammatory
autoimmune diseases.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Stammers et al. (2000) identified 6
putative exons encoding BTNL2.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Stammers et al. (2000) mapped the BTNL2
gene at the border of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class
II and class III regions on 6p21.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of an association between variation in the BTNL2 gene and
inflammatory bowel disease, see IBD3 (604519).

For discussion of an association between variation in the BTNL2 gene and
susceptibility to sarcoidosis, see SS2 (612387).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SARCOIDOSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
BTNL2, IVS5, G-A, -1

In a study of 947 independent cases of familial and sporadic sarcoidosis
(SS2; 612387), Valentonyte et al. (2005) identified a G-to-A transition
at position -1 of a splice donor site (dbSNP rs2076530) in the BTNL2
gene. The change resulted in the use of an alternative splice site
located 4 bp upstream. The loss of 4 bases from the cDNA transcribed
from the A allele resulted in a frameshift and a premature stop in the
downstream exon. In the corresponding protein product, the 118
C-terminal residues in the nontruncated protein were replaced by 5
different amino acids. The mutant protein lacks the C-terminal IgC
domain and transmembrane helix, thereby disrupting localization of the
protein.

609624	TITLE *609624 MITOCHONDRIAL COILED-COIL DOMAIN 1; MCCD1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using bioinformatics analyses, Semple et al. (2003) identified a novel
human gene, mitochondrial coiled-coil domain-1 (MCCD1), in the major
histocompatibility (MHC) class III region (see 142800). The MCCD1 gene
encodes a deduced 119-amino acid protein containing a putative
coiled-coil domain at its C terminus and a predicted mitochondrial
localization signal at its N terminus. RT-PCR analysis detected
expression of MCCD1 in all human tissues tested, at highest levels in
adult and fetal kidney, liver and lung, and fetal brain, and at lower
levels in fetal spleen. Semple et al. (2003) identified the MCCD1
ortholog in pig. The human and pig proteins share 65.9% overall sequence
identity but their C-terminal domains are highly conserved, showing 92%
identity over 53 residues. No orthologs were identified in any other
species, suggesting that the gene arose relatively recently in
evolution. Transient expression in mammalian cells of MCCD1 fused at its
C terminus to either EGFP or the T7-epitope tag showed that the protein
is localized to mitochondria (Semple et al., 2003).

MAPPING

Using bioinformatics analyses, Semple et al. (2003) identified the MCCD1
gene in the MHC class III region, between the BAT1 gene (142560) and the
MHC class I genes, on chromosome 6p21.3. Semple et al. (2003) also
identified 3 MCCD1 pseudogenes within the MHC class I region. Semple et
al. (2003) mapped the pig MCCD1 gene to an analogous chromosomal
position within the MHC.

GENE STRUCTURE

Semple et al. (2003) determined that the MCCD1 gene contains 2 exons.
The distance between the 3-prime UTR of MCCD1 and the 3-prime UTR of the
BAT1 gene, which is transcribed in the opposite orientation, is only 4
bp.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using DHPLC and sequencing, Semple et al. (2003) found that the MCCD1
gene is highly polymorphic, containing approximately 1 single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) every 99 basepairs.

603042	TITLE *603042 SMALL UBIQUITIN-LIKE MODIFIER 2; SUMO2
;;SMT3, YEAST, HOMOLOG 2; SMT3H2;;
SMT3B;;
SENTRIN 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SUMO proteins, such as SUMO2, and ubiquitin (see 191339)
posttranslationally modify numerous cellular proteins and affect their
metabolism and function. However, unlike ubiquitination, which targets
proteins for degradation, sumoylation participates in a number of
cellular processes, such as nuclear transport, transcriptional
regulation, apoptosis, and protein stability (Su and Li, 2002).

CLONING

Sentrin (SUMO1; 601912), or SMT3H3, is a ubiquitin-like protein that can
be conjugated to other proteins via a conserved glycine residue, after
its C terminus is processed. SMT3H3 can covalently modify RANGAP1
(602362), a RAN (601179) GTPase-activating protein critically involved
in nuclear transport. Kamitani et al. (1998) identified a human cDNA in
the sequence databases that encodes sentrin-2, or SMT3H2, a novel member
of the sentrin family of proteins. SMT3H2 is a deduced 95-amino acid
polypeptide that contains a ubiquitin domain, an N-terminal extension,
and the conserved C-terminal Gly-Gly residues. The amino acid sequence
of SMT3H2 is 46% identical to that of SMT3H3. By Northern blot analysis,
the authors found that SMT3H2 and SMT3H3 were expressed in all tissues
examined. Adams et al. (1993) and Lapenta et al. (1997) independently
isolated human expressed sequence tags encoding SMT3H2.

Mannen et al. (1996) also cloned SMT3H2. Northern blot analysis of
several human tissues detected SMT3H2 abundantly and ubiquitously
expressed as a 1.35-kb transcript.

Su and Li (2002) determined that all SUMO proteins from yeast to human
share the conserved ubiquitin domain and the C-terminal diglycine
cleavage/attachment site. The most prominent difference between SUMO
proteins and ubiquitin is the presence of highly variable N-terminal
extensions in the SUMO proteins. The mouse and human SUMO2 proteins are
identical, and human SUMO2 shares 44% and 86% amino acid identity with
SUMO1 and SUMO3 (602231), respectively. RT-PCR of HeLa, kidney, and
neuronal cell lines indicated that expression of SUMO2 was intermediate
between the high expression of SUMO1 and the low expression of SUMO3.

GENE FUNCTION

Kamitani et al. (1998) observed that SMT3H2 formed a number of
conjugates similar to those of SMT3H3, required cleavage of its C
terminus for conjugation to occur, and underwent identical C-terminal
processing as SMT3H3. Kamitani et al. (1998) showed that RANGAP1 could
be modified by either SMT3H2 or SMT3H3, that the formation of the
sentrinized RANGAP1 requires a covalent linkage between itself and
SMT3H2 or SMT3H3, and that SMT3H2 derivatives are located predominantly
in the nucleus.

Dai and Liew (2001) demonstrated that RNF28 (606131) interacts with
SMT3H2 through its RING domain.

Su and Li (2002) found that expression of epitope-labeled SUMO2 in baby
hamster fibroblasts resulted in its conjugation to many cellular
proteins between 76 and 170 kD. Free SUMO2 was detected at about 20 kD.
Immunofluorescent staining detected SUMO2 predominantly on nuclear
bodies. SUMO1 and SUMO3 were predominantly detected on nuclear membranes
and in the cytoplasm, respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Su and Li (2002) reported that the SUMO2 gene contains 4 exons and spans
about 14.9 kb.

MAPPING

Su and Li (2002) reported that the SUMO2 gene maps to chromosome
17q25.1. There are 23 intronless SUMO2 pseudogenes that contain many
mutations.

138550	TITLE *138550 GLYCOGEN PHOSPHORYLASE, BRAIN TYPE; PYGB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Newgard et al. (1988) cloned the cDNA encoding a new isozyme of glycogen
phosphorylase (1,4-D-glucan:orthosphosphate D-glucosyltransferase; EC
2.4.1.1) from a cDNA library prepared from a human brain astrocytoma
cell line. Blot-hybridization analysis showed that the message is
preferentially expressed in human brain, but is also found at a low
level in human fetal liver and adult liver and muscle tissues. The
protein sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence was 862 amino
acids long compared with 846 and 841 amino acids for the liver (PYGL;
613741) and muscle (PYGM; 608455) isozymes, respectively. The greater
length of brain phosphorylase was found to be due entirely to an
extension at the c-terminal portion of the protein. Muscle and brain
isozymes shared greater similarities with each other than either did
with the liver sequence.

MAPPING

Newgard et al. (1988) found by spot-blot hybridization of brain
phosphorylase cDNA to laser-sorted human chromosome fractions and
Southern blot analysis of hamster/human hybrid cell line DNA that the
exact homolog of the cloned glycogen phosphorylase maps to chromosome
20, but that a slightly less homologous gene is found on chromosome 10
as well. The liver and muscle genes had previously been localized to
chromosomes 14 and 11, respectively. The findings suggested to Newgard
et al. (1988) that the phosphorylase genes evolved by duplication and
translocation of a common ancestral gene, leading to divergence of
elements controlling gene expression and of structural features of the
phosphorylase proteins that confer tissue-specific functional
properties.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Yasuda et al. (1993) mapped the
PYGB gene to 20p11, proximal to SSTR4 (182454), which is located at
20p11.2. The gene in the mouse maps to chromosome 2 (Glaser et al.,
1989).

;;ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR, NEURONAL NICOTINIC, ALPHA-2 SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Elliott et al. (1996) cloned CHRNA2 from a thalamus cDNA library
following low-stringency screening with the rat alpha-4-1 probe. The
deduced 503-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 56.9
kD and contains a signal peptide, 3 N-glycosylation sites, and 4
transmembrane regions. The human and rat proteins share 84% sequence
identity.

Aridon et al. (2006) found high expression of CHRNA2 mRNA in human
thalamus, with lower levels of expression throughout other regions of
the brain.

MAPPING

By genomic Southern analysis of hamster/human somatic cell hybrid DNAs,
Anand and Lindstrom (1992) mapped the gene encoding the alpha-2 subunit
of the human neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor to chromosome 8.
The corresponding gene is located on chromosome 14 in the mouse (Bessis
et al., 1990).

EVOLUTION

Human evolution is characterized by a dramatic increase in brain size
and complexity. To probe its genetic basis, Dorus et al. (2004) examined
the evolution of genes involved in diverse aspects of nervous system
biology. These genes, including CHRNA2, displayed significantly higher
rates of protein evolution in primates than in rodents. This trend was
most pronounced for the subset of genes implicated in nervous system
development. Moreover, within primates, the acceleration of protein
evolution was most prominent in the lineage leading from ancestral
primates to humans. Dorus et al. (2004) concluded that the phenotypic
evolution of the human nervous system has a salient molecular correlate,
i.e., accelerated evolution of the underlying genes, particularly those
linked to nervous system development.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In all 10 affected members of a Sardinian family with autosomal dominant
nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy-4 (ENFL4; 610353), Aridon et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous mutation in the CHRNA2 gene (118502.0001). One
unaffected family member carried the mutation, indicating incomplete
penetrance.

In all 10 affected members of a Sardinian family with autosomal dominant
nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy-4 (ENFL4; 610353), Aridon et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous 836T-A transversion in exon 6 of the CHRNA2
gene, resulting in an ile279-to-asn (I279N) substitution in a conserved
residue in the first transmembrane domain (M1) of the protein. The
mutation was not identified in 340 control chromosomes. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the I279N mutation markedly
increased receptor sensitivity to acetylcholine. Aridon et al. (2006)
emphasized that ictal fear sensations in this family suggested
frontolimbic involvement.

609189	TITLE *609189 ANTI-SILENCING FUNCTION 1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, A; ASF1A
;;CCG1-INTERACTING FACTOR A; CIA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using CCG1 (TAF1; 313650) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, followed
by EST database analysis, Munakata et al. (2000) cloned ASF1A, which
they called CIA. The deduced protein contains 204 amino acids. The
N-terminal 153 amino acids share 59% identity with yeast Asf1, but the C
terminus shows little homology.

Using TLK1 (608438) and TLK2 (608439) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen
of a peripheral lymphocyte cDNA library, Sillje and Nigg (2001) cloned
ASF1A and ASF1B (609190). The deduced 205-amino acid ASF1A protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 22.9 kD and shares 71% amino acid identity
with ASF1B.

GENE FUNCTION

Using recombinant CIA in an in vitro pull-down assay, Munakata et al.
(2000) showed that CIA bound to histones H3 (see 602810)/H4 (see 602822)
from HeLa cell native core histones. A plasmid supercoiling assay
demonstrated that recombinant CIA introduced negative supercoils on
plasmid DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I (TOP1; 126420) and core
histones. Supercoiling activity was independent of ATP. Since yeast Asf1
derepresses silenced genes following overexpression, Munakata et al.
(2000) suggested that the histone chaperone activity of CIA may be
related to gene derepression.

Sillje and Nigg (2001) found that in vitro translated ASF1A and ASF1B
were phosphorylated by TLK1 and TLK2. The levels of ASF1A and ASF1B were
unchanged during the cell cycle in synchronized HeLa cells. However,
ASF1A was strongly phosphorylated during S phase, which correlated with
high TLK activity. ASF1A was rapidly dephosphorylated upon inhibition of
DNA replication and activation of the DNA replication checkpoint,
concomitant with inactivation of TLKs.

Mello et al. (2002) found that ASF1A and ASF1B interacted directly and
functioned synergistically with human CAF1 (see 601245) to assemble
nucleosomes during nucleotide excision repair in vitro.

In senescent cells, specialized domains of transcriptionally silent
senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF), containing
heterochromatin proteins such as HP1 (CBX5; 604478), are believed to
repress expression of proliferation-promoting genes, which leads to
senescence-associated cell cycle exit. Zhang et al. (2005) found that
interaction between the transcriptional regulator HIRA (600237) and
ASF1A is rate limiting for the formation of SAHF. The 2 proteins
appeared to interact within a pathway involving the flux of
heterochromatic proteins through PML (102578) nuclear bodies.

Groth et al. (2007) characterized the complex in which the human histone
chaperone ASF1 and MCM2-7 (see 116945), the putative replicative
helicase, are connected through a histone H3-H4 bridge. Depletion of
ASF1 by RNA interference impeded DNA unwinding at replication sites, and
similar defects arose from overproduction of new histone H3-H4 that
compromised ASF1 function. Groth et al. (2007) concluded that their data
link ASF1 chaperone function, histone supply, and replicative unwinding
of DNA in chromatin. Groth et al. (2007) proposed that ASF1, as a
histone acceptor and donor, handles parental and new histones at the
replication fork via an ASF1-(H3-H4)-MCM2-7 intermediate and thus
provides a means to fine-tune replication fork progression and histone
supply and demand.

Das et al. (2009) demonstrated that the histone chaperones ASF1A in
humans and Asf1 in Drosophila are required for acetylation of histone H3
at lys56 (H3K56) in vivo, whereas the histone chaperone CAF1 (see
601245) in humans and Caf1 in Drosophila are required for the
incorporation of histones bearing this mark into chromatin.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Natsume et al. (2007) reported the crystal structure, at 2.7-angstrom
resolution, of CIA-I in complex with histones H3 (see 142780) and H4
(see 602822). The structure shows the histone H3-H4 dimer's mutually
exclusive interactions with another histone H3-H4 dimer and CIA-I. The
carboxy-terminal beta-strand of histone H4 changes its partner from the
beta-strand in histone H2A (see 602786) to that of CIA-I through large
conformational change. In vitro functional analysis demonstrated that
CIA-I has a histone H3-H4 tetramer-disrupting activity. Mutants with
weak histone H3-H4 dimer-binding activity showed critical functional
effects on cellular processes related to transcription.

MAPPING

Hartz (2005) mapped the ASF1A gene to chromosome 6q22.31 based on an
alignment of the ASF1A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB028628) with the
genomic sequence.

600662	TITLE *600662 MADS BOX TRANSCRIPTION ENHANCER FACTOR 2, POLYPEPTIDE C; MEF2C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MEF2C belongs to the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family of
transcription factors. MEF2C plays a pivotal role in myogenesis,
development of the anterior heart field, neural crest and craniofacial
development, and neurogenesis, among others (summary by Zweier et al.,
2010).

See also MEF2A (600660).

CLONING

McDermott et al. (1993) cloned a member of the MEF2 family of proteins
from a human skeletal muscle cDNA library using a fragment of the MEF2A
cDNA as a probe. Transcripts of MEF2C were found in the skeletal muscle
and brain. Alternative splice variants were found, 1 of which was unique
to the brain.

Leifer et al. (1993) found that the brain form was expressed by neurons
in particular layers of the cerebral cortex and that expression declined
during postnatal development. The skeletal isoform of the cDNA encodes a
465-amino acid protein with conserved MADS and MEF2 domains. Like the
other MEF2 gene products, MEF2C has both DNA binding and
trans-activating activities indistinguishable from other members of the
family. MEF2C, however, is induced late during myogenic differentiation
and has a strict tissue-specific pattern of expression not seen in MEF2A
or MEF2B.

Zweier et al. (2010) found high expression of isoform 1 of the MEF2C
gene in fetal and adult human brain, whereas isoform 2 was widely
expressed with highest levels in skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Breitbart et al. (1993) suggested that, while MEF2A may be involved in
induction of muscle differentiation, MEF2C may be involved with
maintenance of the differentiated state.

CREB-binding protein (CBP; 600140)/p300 (602700) and p300/CBP-associated
factor (PCAF; 602203) are coactivators for MEF2C during differentiation.
Chen et al. (2000) showed that NCOA2 mediates the coactivation of
MEF2C-dependent transcription through interaction with the MADS box
domain of MEF2C. They proposed a model of cooperative interaction
between NCOA2, myogenin (MYOG; 159980), and MEF2C in the regulation of
muscle-specific gene expression.

During mammalian development, electrical activity promotes the
calcium-dependent survival of neurons that have made appropriate
synaptic connections. Mao et al. (1999) showed that calcium influx into
cerebellar neurons triggers the activation of the MKK6 (601254)-p38 MAP
kinase (600289) cascade and that the p38 MAP kinase then phosphorylates
and activates MEF2s. Once activated by this calcium-dependent p38 MAP
kinase signaling pathway, MEF2 can regulate the expression of genes that
are critical for survival of newly differentiated neurons. These
findings demonstrated that MEF2 is a calcium-regulated transcription
factor and defined a function for MEF2 during nervous system development
that is distinct from previously well-characterized functions of MEF2
during muscle differentiation.

Chen et al. (2002) demonstrated that Carm1 (603934) and Ncoa2
cooperatively stimulated the activity of Mef2c in mouse mesenchymal stem
cells and found that there was direct interaction among Mef2c, Grip1,
and Carm1.

By targeting human MEF2A or mouse Mef2c expression to mouse
cardiomyocytes, Xu et al. (2006) demonstrated that overexpressing these
transcription factors caused cardiomyopathy or predisposed transgenic
mice to more fulminant disease following pressure overload. In cultured
cardiomyocytes, MEF2A or Mef2c overexpression induced sarcomeric
disorganization and focal elongation. Both MEF2A and Mef2c programmed
similar profiles of gene expression in the heart that included genes
involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, ion handling, and
metabolism.

Potthoff et al. (2007) showed that class II histone deacetylases (e.g.,
HDAC5; 605315) were selectively degraded by the proteasome in mouse
slow, oxidative myofibers, enabling Mef2 to activate the slow myofiber
gene program. Forced expression of Hdac5 in skeletal muscle or genetic
deletion of Mef2c or Mef2d (600663) blocked activity-dependent fast to
slow fiber transformation, whereas expression of hyperactive Mef2c
promoted the slow fiber phenotype, enhancing endurance and enabling mice
to run almost twice the distance of wildtype littermates.

Using a loss-of-function allele in mice, Johnnidis et al. (2008)
reported that the myeloid-specific microRNA-223 (miR223; 300694)
negatively regulates progenitor proliferation and granulocyte
differentiation and activation. miR223 mutant mice had an expanded
granulocytic compartment resulting from a cell-autonomous increase in
the number of granulocyte progenitors. Johnnidis et al. (2008) showed
that Mef2c, a transcription factor that promotes myeloid progenitor
proliferation, is a target of miR223, and that genetic ablation of Mef2c
suppresses progenitor expansion and corrects the neutrophilic phenotype
in miR223-null mice. In addition, granulocytes lacking miR223 were
hypermature, hypersensitive to activating stimuli, and displayed
increased fungicidal activity. As a consequence of this neutrophil
hyperactivity, miR223 mutant mice spontaneously developed inflammatory
lung pathology and exhibited exaggerated tissue destruction after
endotoxin challenge. Johnnidis et al. (2008) concluded that their data
supported a model in which miR223 acts as a fine tuner of granulocyte
production and the inflammatory response.

Zweier et al. (2010) demonstrated that MEF2C increases promoter
activation of the MECP2 (300005) and CDKL5 (300203) genes.

MAPPING

Martin et al. (1994) mapped Mef2 to mouse chromosome 13. By fluorescence
in situ hybridization, Krainc et al. (1995) mapped human MEF2C to
chromosome 5q14, a region with homology of synteny to the mouse
location.

CYTOGENETICS

In 5 unrelated children with severe mental retardation, stereotypic
movements, epilepsy, and/or cerebral malformations (613443), Le Meur et
al. (2010) identified 5 different interstitial de novo deletions of
chromosome 5q14 ranging in size from 216 kb to 8.8 Mb. The minimal
common deleted region contained only the MEF2C gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a girl with severe mental retardation, stereotypic movements,
epilepsy, and cerebral malformation (MRD20; 613443), Le Meur et al.
(2010) identified a de novo heterozygous nonsense mutation in the MEF2C
gene (S228X; 600662.0001). Le Meur et al. (2010) noted that the role of
MEF2C in synaptic plasticity is consistent with a role in learning and
memory, and the authors referred to the mouse models of Li et al. (2008)
and Barbosa et al. (2008).

Zweier et al. (2010) identified 4 different de novo heterozygous
mutations in the MEF2C gene (see. e.g., 600662.0002-600662.0004) in 4 of
362 probands with mental retardation who were screened for mutations in
this gene. Two of the mutations were missense and 2 were truncating. Two
additional patients with a similar disorder had heterozygous deletions
involving the MEF2C gene. Analysis of blood-derived RNA showed
significantly decreased levels of MEF2C isoform 2 mRNA in all patients
with deletions in or including the MEF2C gene region, including the
patients reported by Engels et al. (2009), Cardoso et al. (2009), and Le
Meur et al. (2010), suggesting haploinsufficiency. Two patients with
missense mutations did not show decreased MEF2C mRNA levels. All
deletions and mutations caused significantly decreased MEF2C
transcriptional activity, which could be rescued by wildtype MEF2C.
Finally, all patients, including the 2 with missense mutations, showed
decreased levels of MECP2 mRNA, and all except 2 patients had decreased
levels of CDKL5 mRNA. These 2 genes are involved in Rett or Rett
syndrome-like phenotypes (312750 and 300672, respectively), which shares
some features with MRD20. Zweier et al. (2010) concluded that the
phenotype results from involvement of a common pathway involving these 3
genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Members of the MEF2 family of MADs-box transcription factors bind to an
A-T-rich DNA sequence associated with muscle-specific genes. The murine
Mef2c gene is expressed in heart precursor cells before formation of the
linear heart tube. In mice homozygous for a known mutation of Mef2c, Lin
et al. (1997) found that the heart tube did not undergo looping
morphogenesis, the future right ventricle did not form, and a subset of
cardiac muscle genes was not expressed. The absence of the right
ventricular region of the mutant correlated with downregulation of the
dHAND gene, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor
required for cardiac morphogenesis. The authors concluded that MEF2C is
an essential regulator of cardiac morphogenesis and right ventricular
development.

Von Both et al. (2004) characterized the molecular basis for defective
heart formation in Foxh1 (603621)-null mice and determined that Mef2c is
a direct target of Foxh1. They identified a composite Foxh1-Nkx2.5
(600584)-binding site within the Mef2c gene that was regulated by
Tgf-beta (see 190180) signaling in a Smad-dependent manner. Von Both et
al. (2004) concluded that a TGF-beta-like SMAD signaling pathway
specifies the anterior heart field through a FOXH1-NKX2.5 complex that
regulates MEF2C expression.

Verzi et al. (2007) found that conditional inactivation of Mef2c in
mouse neural crest resulted in neonatal lethality due to severe
craniofacial defects. Mef2c was required for expression of Dlx5
(600028), Dlx6 (600030), and Hand2 (602407) transcription factors in the
branchial arches, and Verzi et al. (2007) identified a branchial
arch-specific enhancer in the Dlx5/Dlx6 locus that was activated
synergistically by Mef2c and Dlx5. Mef2c and Dlx5/Dlx6 also interacted
genetically, since mice heterozygous for either Dlx5/Dlx6 or Mef2c were
normal at birth and survived to weaning, whereas heterozygosity for both
Dlx5/Dlx6 and Mef2c resulted in defective palate development and
neonatal lethality.

Barbosa et al. (2008) found that mice with brain-specific deletion of
the Mef2c gene were viable to adulthood, were slightly smaller than
wildtype littermates, and showed impaired balance beam walking and an
abnormal hind/forelimb clasping reflex at a young age. In addition,
Mef2c-knockout mice showed impaired hippocampal-dependent learning and
memory. These behavioral changes were accompanied by a marked increase
in the number of excitatory synapses and potentiation of basal and
evoked synaptic transmission resulting from altered presynaptic
function. Conversely, neuronal expression of a superactivating form of
Mef2c in postsynaptic cells resulted in a reduction of excitatory
postsynaptic sites without affecting learning and memory performance. No
changes in synapse structure were observed. The findings suggested that
MEF2C activity per se does not directly determine learning, but somehow
facilitates learning-related plasticity by controlling excessive
synaptic input. Barbosa et al. (2008) concluded that refinement of
synaptic connectivity facilitates hippocampal-dependent learning and
memory.

Li et al. (2008) found that conditional knockout of Mef2c in nestin
(NES; 600915)-expressing neural stem/progenitor cells impaired neuronal
differentiation in mice, resulting in aberrant aggregation and
compaction of neurons migrating into the lower layers of the neocortex
during development. Neural stem cell proliferation and survival were not
affected. Conditional Mef2c-null mice surviving to adulthood manifested
smaller, less mature neurons and smaller brain size with more immature
electrophysiologic network properties. They also showed severe
behavioral deficits reminiscent of Rett syndrome (RTT; 312750), such as
anxiety, decreased cognitive function, and marked paw-clasping. Li et
al. (2008) concluded that MEF2C has a crucial role in programming early
neuronal differentiation and proper distribution within the layers of
the neocortex during development.

In an 8-year-old girl with severe MRD20 (613443), Bienvenu et al. (2013)
identified a de novo heterozygous 1-bp deletion (457delA) in exon 5 of
the MEF2C gene, predicted to result in premature termination
(N153TfsX33) and loss of the functional transactivation domain. In
infancy, the patient had poor feeding due to marked hypotonia and poor
eye contact due to strabismus. Motor milestones were delayed, and she
walked at age 4 years. At age 18 months, she had a single episode of
myoclonic febrile seizures that were easily controlled. At age 7 years,
she had poor growth, microcephaly (-2.5 SD), lack of speech,
stereotypical movements, unstable wide-based gait, and happy demeanor.
There were mild dysmorphic features, including large eyebrows, open
mouth with thick everted lower lip, and anteverted nares. Brain MRI was
normal.
