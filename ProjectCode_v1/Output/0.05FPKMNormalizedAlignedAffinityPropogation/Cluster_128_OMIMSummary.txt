DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A cascade of protease reactions is believed to be responsible for the
apoptotic changes observed in mammalian cells undergoing programmed cell
death. This cascade involves members of the aspartate-specific cysteine
proteases of the ICE/CED3 (147678) family, also known as the caspase
family.

CLONING

Fernandes-Alnemri et al. (1996) identified the novel gene MCH5 when they
found a human EST sequence with significant homology to the newly
identified cysteine protease MCH4 (601762). They used PCR to clone a
cDNA of the MCH5 gene from a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library. Sequence
analysis revealed that it encodes a polypeptide of 496 amino acids with
greatest homology to MCH4. The authors found that MCH4 and MCH5 both
contain the active site pentapeptide QACQG instead of the QACRG present
in all other known members of the family. Furthermore, the authors found
that the sequences of MCH4 and MCH5 contain Fas-associating protein with
death domain (FADD)-like domains, suggesting possible interaction with
FADD. Fernandes-Alnemri et al. (1996) stated that MCH5, like other
members of the ICE/CED3 family, forms an active protease only after
cleavage of its proenzyme into 2 subunits which dimerize to form the
active enzyme.

Using MORT1 (FADD; 602457) in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a B-cell cDNA
library, Boldin et al. (1996) cloned several splice variants of CASP8,
which they called MACH. The isoforms could be divided into 2 main
subgroups. All isoforms share a common 182-amino acid N-terminal region,
including 2 MORT modules (i.e., death effector domains, or DEDs), but
they have different C termini. Subgroup alpha isoforms have C termini
containing a CED3/ICE homology domain that contains the catalytic site
and the substrate-binding pocket, while subgroup beta isoforms are
truncated and lack the CED3/ICE homology domain. The longest isoform,
MACH-alpha-1, encodes a deduced 479-amino acid protein. The CED3/ICE
domain of MACH-alpha-1 shares 41% and 34% identity with the homologous
regions in CPP32 (CASP3; 600636) and C. elegans CED3, respectively.
Northern blot analysis detected MACH transcripts ranging in size between
2.85 and 3.5 kb in all tissues examined, with highest levels in resting
peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes and lowest levels in testis and
skeletal muscle.

Eckhart et al. (2001) identified several CASP8 splice variants that
preferentially use a distant splice donor site at the 3-prime end of
exon 8. Use of this distant site, which they called exon 8b, results in
mRNAs with truncated open reading frames. RT-PCR indicated equal
expression of both mRNA species in tonsil, spleen, bone marrow, thymus,
and lymph nodes. Peripheral blood leukocytes, heart, and epidermis
predominantly expressed mRNA containing exon 8b, as did a promyelocytic
cell line and a T-cell line. Liver and nearly all immortalized cell
lines, as well as primary endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and
keratinocytes, expressed mRNA lacking the 8b extension.

GENE FUNCTION

Using fluorogenic peptide substrates corresponding to a sequence within
the nuclear protein PARP (173870), Boldin et al. (1996) confirmed that
MACH-alpha-1 is a thiol protease. By site-directed mutagenesis, they
identified cys360 as the catalytic cysteine. Using mutation analysis,
Boldin et al. (1996) determined that MACH binds to the N terminus of
MORT1. They also found that it self-associates, but it does not interact
directly with FAS/APO1 (TNRFSF6; 134637). Transfection of human
embryonic kidney cells and breast carcinoma cells with MACH-alpha-1 or
MACH-alpha-2 resulted in massive cell death.

Muzio et al. (1996) determined that CASP8, which they called FLICE,
interacts with wildtype FADD but not with FADD lacking the DED. They
also determined that granzyme B (GZMB; 123910) can remove the prodomain
and generate the active p20/p10 dimeric cysteine protease. Cleavage of
PARP by CASP8 resulted in the appearance of signature apoptotic
fragments. Transfection and overexpression of CASP8 in transfected
breast cancer cells resulted in apoptosis.

Expression of cDNAs that encode truncated polypeptides containing mostly
expanded polyglutamine repeats, but not of those that encode the
corresponding full-length proteins, has been shown to induce cell death
by apoptosis. Such truncated proteins have been shown to form aggregates
or inclusions (Ikeda et al., 1996). Sanchez et al. (1999) studied the
role of caspases in polyglutamine-induced cell death in established
cultures of primary cortical, striatal, and cerebellar neurons from
embryonic day 17 rat embryos, transfected with an expression construct
encoding truncated ataxin-3 that contained 79 glutamine (Q79) residues.
The authors showed that the apoptosis inhibitors Bcl2, CrmA, and a
truncated Fas/APO1-associated death domain protein (FADD DN) inhibited
polyglutamine repeat-induced neuronal cell death. A mutant Jurkat cell
line specifically lacking caspase-8 was resistant to
polyglutamine-induced cell death. Cells transfected with Q79 showed
insoluble inclusions. Caspase-8 was recruited and activated by these Q79
inclusions. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of activated
caspase-8 in the insoluble fraction of affected brain regions from
Huntington disease (143100) patients but not in those from controls. The
authors suggested that caspase-8 has an essential role in
Huntington-related neurodegenerative diseases.

Eckhart et al. (2001) found that different CASP8 isoforms were expressed
in resting and activated lymphocytes. Activation of lymphocytes shifted
the expression from mRNA species containing an exon 8b extension to
mRNAs that lack it. Differentiation in a promyelocytic cell line was
associated with the opposite shift, from mRNAs containing the shorter
exon 8 to mRNAs that include the exon 8b extension.

Gervais et al. (2002) found that HIP1 (601767) binds to the HIP1 protein
interactor (HIPPI; 606621), which has partial sequence homology to HIP1
and similar tissue and subcellular distribution. The availability of
free HIP1 is modulated by polyglutamine length within huntingtin
(613004), with disease-associated polyglutamine expansion favoring the
formation of proapoptotic HIPPI-HIP1 heterodimers. This heterodimer can
recruit procaspase-8 into a complex of HIPPI, HIP1, and procaspase-8,
and launch apoptosis through components of the extrinsic cell death
pathway. Gervais et al. (2002) proposed that huntingtin polyglutamine
expansion liberates HIP1 so that it can form a caspase-8 recruitment
complex with HIPPI, possibly contributing to neuronal death in
Huntington disease.

Yu et al. (2004) defined a novel molecular pathway in which activation
of the receptor-interacting protein (RIP; 603453), a serine-threonine
kinase, and Jun amino-terminal kinase (601158) induced cell death with
the morphology of autophagy. Autophagic death required the genes ATG7
(GSA7; 608760) and beclin-1 (604378) and was induced by caspase-8
inhibition. Yu et al. (2004) cautioned that clinical therapies involving
caspase inhibitors may arrest apoptosis but also have the unanticipated
effect of promoting autophagic cell death.

Poulaki et al. (2005) found that human retinoblastoma (RB1; 614041) cell
lines were resistant to death receptor (see DR5; 603612)-mediated
apoptosis because of a deficiency of CASP8 expression secondary to
epigenetic gene silencing by overmethylation. Treatment with a
demethylating agent restored CASP8 expression and sensitivity to
apoptosis.

Su et al. (2005) showed that caspase-8 deficiency (607271) in humans and
mice specifically abolishes activation of the transcription factor NF
kappa-B (164011) after stimulation through antigen receptors, Fc
receptors, or Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4; 603030) in T, B, and natural
killer cells. Caspase-8 also causes the alpha-beta complex of the
inhibitor of NF-kappa-B kinase (IKK; 600644 and 300248, respectively) to
associate with the upstream BCL10 (603517)-MALT1 (604860) adaptor
complex. Recruitment of the IKK-alpha,beta complex, its activation, and
the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa-B require enzyme activity of
full-length caspase-8. Su et al. (2005) concluded that their findings
explained the paradoxical association of defective apoptosis and
combined immunodeficiency in human caspase-8 deficiency.

Stupack et al. (2006) showed that suppression of caspase-8 expression
occurs during the establishment of neuroblastoma (256700) metastases in
vivo, and that reconstitution of caspase-8 expression in deficient
neuroblastoma cells suppressed their metastases. Caspase-8 status was
not a predictor of primary tumor growth; rather, caspase-8 selectively
potentiated apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells invading the collagenous
stroma at the tumor margin. Apoptosis was initiated by unligated
integrins (see 605025) by means of a process known as integrin-mediated
death. Loss of caspase-8 or integrin rendered the cells refractory to
integrin-mediated death, allowed cellular survival in the stromal
microenvironment, and promoted metastases. Stupack et al. (2006)
concluded that these findings define caspase-8 as a metastasis
suppressor gene that, together with integrins, regulates the survival
and invasive capacity of neuroblastoma cells.

Oberst et al. (2011) showed that development of caspase-8-deficient mice
is completely rescued by ablation of receptor-interacting protein
kinase-3 (RIPK3; 605817). Adult animals lacking both caspase-8 and Ripk3
displayed a progressive lymphoaccumulative disease resembling that seen
with defects in Cd95 (FAS; 134637) or Cd95 ligand (FASL; 134638), and
resisted the lethal effects of Cd95 ligation in vivo. Oberst et al.
(2011) found that caspase-8 prevents RIPK3-dependent necrosis without
inducing apoptosis by functioning in a proteolytically active complex
with CFLAR (603599) and that this complex is required for the protective
function.

Kaiser et al. (2011) found that Ripk3 is responsible for the
midgestational death of Casp8-deficient embryos. Remarkably,
Casp8-null/Rip3-null-double mutant mice were viable and matured into
fertile adults with a full immune complement of myeloid and lymphoid
cell types. These mice seemed immunocompetent but developed
lymphadenopathy by 4 months of age marked by accumulation of abnormal T
cells in the periphery, a phenotype reminiscent of mice with Fas
deficiency. Thus, Kaiser et al. (2011) concluded that Casp8 contributes
to homeostatic control in the adult immune system; however, RIPK3 and
CASP8 are together completely dispensable for mammalian development.

Burguillos et al. (2011) showed that the orderly activation of caspase-8
and caspase-3/7 (600636/601761), known executioners of apoptotic cell
death, regulate microglia activation through a protein kinase C-delta
(PPKCD; 176977)-dependent pathway. Burguillos et al. (2011) found that
stimulation of microglia with various inflammogens activates caspase-8
and caspase-3/7 in microglia without triggering cell death in vitro and
in vivo. Knockdown or chemical inhibition of each of these caspases
hindered microglia activation and consequently reduced neurotoxicity.
The authors observed that these caspases are activated in microglia in
the ventral mesencephalon of Parkinson disease (168600) and the frontal
cortex of individuals with Alzheimer disease (104300). Burguillos et al.
(2011) concluded that caspase-8 and caspase-3/7 are involved in
regulating microglia activation, and suggested that inhibition of these
caspases could be neuroprotective by targeting the microglia rather than
the neurons themselves.

Gunther et al. (2011) demonstrated a critical role for caspase-8 in
regulating necroptosis of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and
terminal ileitis. Mice with a conditional deletion of caspase-8 in the
intestinal epithelium (Casp8-delta-IEC) spontaneously developed
inflammatory lesions in the terminal ileum were highly susceptible to
colitis. These mice lacked Paneth cells and showed reduced numbers of
goblet cells, indicating dysregulated antimicrobial immune cell
functions of the intestinal epithelium. Casp8-delta-IEC mice showed
increased cell death in the Paneth cell area of small intestinal crypts.
Epithelial cell death was induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA;
191160), was associated with increased expression of
receptor-interacting protein-3 (RIP3; 605817) and could be inhibited on
blockade of necroptosis. Lastly, Gunther et al. (2011) identified high
levels of RIP3 in human Paneth cells and increased necroptosis in the
terminal ileum of patients with Crohn disease, suggesting a potential
role of necroptosis in the pathogenesis of this disease. Gunther et al.
(2011) concluded that their data demonstrated a critical function of
caspase-8 in regulating intestinal homeostasis and in protecting IECs
from TNFA-induced necroptotic cell death.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Varfolomeev et al. (1998) determined that
the CASP8 gene contains 8 exons. Hadano et al. (2001) determined that
the CASP8 gene contains 13 exons and spans 51.2 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Kischkel et al. (1998)
mapped the CASP8 gene to human chromosome 2q33-q34 and mouse chromosome
1B-proximal C. This mapping further extended the known homology of
synteny between these regions of human chromosome 2 and mouse chromosome
1. By FISH, Grenet et al. (1999) also mapped the CASP8 gene to 2q33-q34.
They noted that CASP10 (601762), whose product is closely related to
that of CASP8, has been mapped to the same location, indicating that the
2 genes have evolved by tandem duplication.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Liu et al. (2002) identified a naturally occurring deletion of leu62
within the first DED of CASP8 in A431 human vulva squamous carcinoma
cells. This deletion resulted in defective CASP8-dependent apoptosis.
Unlike wildtype CASP8, CASP8 lacking leu62 failed to form oligomers with
wildtype CASP8 and failed to interact with FADD. The mutation did not
effect proteolytic activation by granzyme B, nor did it effect catalytic
activity against PARP.

In 2 affected sibs from a consanguineous family with caspase-8
deficiency (607271), Chun et al. (2002) identified a homozygous mutation
in the CASP8 gene (601763.0001). The patients had defects in the
activation of T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, which led to
immunodeficiency.

Soung et al. (2005) analyzed the entire coding region of the CASP8 gene
in 69 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC; 114550), 2 with low-grade
dysplastic nodule (LGDN), 2 with high-grade dysplastic nodule (HGDN),
and 65 without dysplastic nodules, and detected a total of 9 somatic
mutations (13%). All 9 mutations were an identical 2-bp deletion
(nucleotides 1225-1226; 601763.0002), which was predicted to result in
frameshift and premature termination of amino acid synthesis in the p10
protease subunit. The change was detected both in HCC and in LGDN
lesions, suggesting that CASP8 mutation may be involved in the early
stage of HCC carcinogenesis. Soung et al. (2005) found that expression
of the tumor-derived caspase-8 mutant in cells abolished cell death
activity of caspase-8.

Cox et al. (2007) reported the findings of the Breast Cancer Association
Consortium (BCAC), which had been established to conduct combined
case-control analyses with augmented statistical power to try to confirm
putative genetic associations with breast cancer. They genotyped 9 SNPs
for which there was some prior evidence of an association with breast
cancer (114480). They included data from 9 to 15 studies, comprising
11,391 to 18,290 cases and 14,753 to 22,670 controls. They found
evidence of a protective association with breast cancer for a D302H
polymorphism in CASP8 (601763.0003), and weaker evidence for an L10P SNP
in the TGFB1 gene (190180.0007). These results demonstrated that common
breast cancer susceptibility alleles with small effects on risk can be
identified, given sufficiently powerful studies.

Caspases are important in the life and death of immune cells and
therefore influence immune surveillance of malignancies. Sun et al.
(2007) tested whether genetic variants in CASP8, CASP10, (601762), and
CFLAR (603599), 3 genes important for death receptor-induced cell
killing residing in tandem order on chromosome 2q33, are associated with
cancer susceptibility. Using a haplotype-tagging SNP approach, they
identified a 6-nucleotide deletion (-652 6N del) variant in the CASP8
promoter (601763.0004) associated with decreased risk of lung cancer.
The deletion destroyed a binding site for stimulatory protein-1 (SP1;
189906) and decreased transcription. Biochemical analyses showed that T
lymphocytes with the deletion variant had lower caspase-8 activity and
activation-induced cell death upon stimulation with cancer cell
antigens. Case-control analyses of 4,995 individuals with cancer and
4,972 controls in a Chinese population showed that this genetic variant
is associated with reduced susceptibility to multiple cancers, including
lung, esophageal, gastric, colorectal, cervical, and breast cancers,
acting in an allele dose-dependent manner. The results supported the
hypothesis that genetic variants influencing immune status modify cancer
susceptibility. Haiman et al. (2008) did not find an association between
this SNP and breast (114480), colorectal (114500), or prostate (176807)
cancer among 2,098, 1,139, and 2,825 patients, respectively. The study
included patients in Hawaii and California of various ethnic groups.

ANIMAL MODEL

Varfolomeev et al. (1998) generated mice deficient in Casp8 by
disrupting exons 1 and 2, which encode the N-terminal death effector
domains (DEDs) that interact with MORT1/FADD. Whereas wildtype and
heterozygous mice appeared normal, no homozygous mutant mice survived
beyond approximately embryonic day 13.5. Histopathologic analysis
revealed marked abdominal hyperemia with erythrocytosis in the liver,
major blood vessels, capillaries, and other organs. Cardiac ventricular
musculature was thin and similar to early mesenchyme. Colony forming
assays showed that hemopoietic precursor cells were markedly reduced in
the mutant mice. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis indicated
that fibroblasts from mutant mice responded normally to the noncytocidal
effects of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR; 191190) and death
receptor-3 (DR3, or TNFRSF12; 603366) stimulation, whereas wildtype
fibroblasts were killed by TNF (191160) treatment or FAS cross-linking.
Agents such as ultraviolet irradiation and protein kinase inhibitors
were lethal for mutant and normal fibroblasts. Varfolomeev et al. (1998)
concluded that CASP8 is necessary for death induction by receptors of
the TNF/nerve growth factor (see NGFR; 162010) family and is vital in
embryonal development.

Zender et al. (2003) evaluated the efficacy of small interfering RNA
(siRNA) in vivo in different mouse models with acute liver failure. They
directed 21-nucleotide siRNAs against caspase-8, which is a key enzyme
in death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Systemic administration of
caspase-8 siRNA resulted in inhibition of caspase-8 gene expression in
the liver, therefore preventing CD95-mediated apoptosis. Protection of
hepatocytes by caspase-8 siRNA significantly attenuated acute liver
damage induced by CD95 antibody or by adenovirus expressing FAS ligand.
In a clinical situation, siRNAs would most likely be administered after
the onset of acute liver failure. Therefore, Zender et al. (2003)
injected caspase-8 siRNA at a time during experimentally-induced liver
failure with already elevated liver transaminases. Improvement of
survival due to RNA interference was significant even when caspase-8
siRNA was applied during ongoing acute liver failure.

Salmena and Hakem (2005) used the Cre/lox recombinase system to generate
mice lacking Casp8 only in T cells (Tcasp8 -/- mice). Tcasp8 -/- mice
developed an age-dependent lethal lymphoproliferative and
lymphoinfiltrative immune disorder characterized by lymphoadenopathy,
splenomegaly, and T-cell infiltrates in lung, liver, and kidney.
Although there was lymphopenia in young Tcasp8 -/- mice, peripheral T
cells in old Tcasp8 -/- mice proliferated in the absence of infection or
stimulation. Salmena and Hakem (2005) proposed that Tcasp8 -/- mice may
serve as a model of human CASP8 deficiency and that CASP8 in T cells is
required for lymphocyte homeostasis.

To define the contribution of reduced caspase-8 to a wound healing
response, Lee et al. (2009) generated an epidermal knockout of
caspase-8. By postnatal day 10 the conditional knockout mouse had flaky
skin throughout its body, was slightly runted, and its epidermis was
dramatically thickened. Lee et al. (2009) found that even though
caspase-8 is normally expressed in the granular layer, it was the basal
and spinous layers that were markedly expanded in the knockout
epidermis. Lee et al. (2009) demonstrated that the loss of epidermal
caspase-8, an important mediator of apoptosis, recapitulated several
phases of a wound healing response in the mouse. The epidermal
hyperplasia in the caspase-8 null skin is the culmination of signals
exchanged between epidermal keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and
leukocytic cells. This reciprocal interaction is initiated by the
paracrine signaling of interleukin 1-alpha (IL1-alpha; 147760), which
activates both skin stem cell proliferation and cutaneous inflammation.
The noncanonical secretion of IL1-alpha is induced by a p38-MAPK
(600289)-mediated upregulation of NALP3 (606416), leading to
inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation. Notably, the increased
proliferation of basal keratinocytes is counterbalanced by the growth
arrest of suprabasal keratinocytes in the stratified epidermis by
IL1-alpha-dependent NF-kappa-B (see 164011) signaling. Lee et al. (2009)
concluded that their findings illustrated how the loss of caspase-8 can
affect more than programmed cell death to alter the local
microenvironment and elicit processes common to wound repair and many
neoplastic skin disorders.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CASPASE 8 DEFICIENCY
CASP8, ARG248TRP

In 2 affected sibs from a consanguineous family with caspase-8
deficiency (607271), Chun et al. (2002) identified a homozygous C-to-T
transition in the CASP8 gene, resulting in an arg248-to-trp (R248W)
substitution within the p18 protease subunit of the protein. The
asymptomatic mother, father, and sister were heterozygous carriers of
the mutation. In 13 extended family members, Chun et al. (2002)
identified 7 asymptomatic heterozygous carriers but found no additional
homozygous or immunodeficient individuals.

.0002
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, SOMATIC
CASP8, 2-BP DEL, 1225TG

In 9 unrelated patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (114550) and HBV
infection, Soung et al. (2005) identified the same somatic mutation, a
2-bp deletion (1225_1226delTG) in exon 7 that was predicted to result in
frameshift and premature termination of amino acid synthesis in the p10
protease subunit.

.0003
BREAST CANCER, PROTECTION AGAINST
CASP8, ASP302HIS

MacPherson et al. (2004) and Frank et al. (2005) found evidence that the
presence of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CASP8 gene
resulting in an asp302-to-his (D302H) substitution (dbSNP rs1045485)
could reduce susceptibility to breast cancer (114480) in British and
German cohorts, respectively. Cox et al. (2007) found evidence for a
protective effect of the D302H polymorphism in an allele dose-dependent
manner in 16,423 cases and 17,109 controls from 14 studies that
contributed data to the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). The
study achieved odds ratios of 0.89 and 0.74 for heterozygotes and rare
homozygotes, respectively, compared with common homozygotes. This site
was not found to be polymorphic in Korean, Han Chinese, or Japanese
women. Cox et al. (2007) noted that the functional consequences of the
aspartic acid-to-histidine substitution were not known, and further
experiments were required to establish whether D302H itself or another
variant in strong linkage disequilibrium with it is causative.

.0004
LUNG CANCER, PROTECTION AGAINST
CASP8, 6-BP DEL, NT-652

Sun et al. (2007) identified a 6-nucleotide insertion/deletion
polymorphism in the CASP8 promoter, -652 AGTAAG ins/del (dbSNP
rs3834129), the deletion variant of which was associated with decreased
risk of developing lung cancer (211980) in a population of Han Chinese
subjects. The -652 6N deletion was also associated with decreased risk
of cancer of various other forms including esophageal, gastric,
colorectal, cervical, and breast, acting in an allele dose-dependent
manner. The frequency of the -652 6N deletion was significantly lower in
individuals with lung cancer (P = 4.1 x 10(-5)).

Haiman et al. (2008) did not find an association between this SNP and
breast (114480), colorectal (114500), or prostate (176807) cancer among
2,098, 1,139, and 2,825 patients, respectively. The study included
patients in Hawaii and California of various ethnic groups.

613503	TITLE *613503 MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX, CLASS II, DQ ALPHA-2; HLA-DQA2
;;MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX, CLASS II, DX ALPHA; HLA-DXA;;
DX-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HLA class II molecules are heterodimers encoded by alpha and beta genes
located in 3 subregions of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).
HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 (615161) are 1 of 2 pairs of genes in the HLA-DQ
subregion of the MHC. HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 are well conserved and,
unlike most HLA class II genes, exhibit little or no polymorphism
(Berdoz et al., 1989). HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 appear to be specifically
expressed in Langerhans cells (Lenormand et al., 2012).

CLONING

Using various methods, Berdoz et al. (1989) detected only low-level
polymorphism in the HLA-DQA2 gene that was restricted to noncoding
regions.

Rudy and Lew (1997) stated that HLA-DQA2 differs from HLA-DQA1 (146880)
only at the penultimate amino acid, where HLA-DQA2 has leu231 and
HLA-DQA1 has pro231. By Western blot analysis of B-lymphoblastoid cell
lines, Rudy and Lew (1997) detected variable expression of HLA-DQA2 in
all MHC class II haplotypes examined. HLA-DQA2 expression was
consistently 3-fold less than that of HLA-DQA1. Immunoprecipitation
analysis showed expression of HLA-DQA2 on the cell surface.

Using RT-PCR, Lenormand et al. (2012) cloned 2 HLA-DQA2 variants from
human Langerhans cell RNA. One variant was full length, with the
potential to encode a transmembrane HLA alpha chain. The other variant
lacked exon 4, which encodes the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains,
and thus had the potential to encode a soluble protein. Additional
RT-PCR experiments confirmed that HLA-DQA2 was specifically expressed in
epidermal Langerhans cells, and not in monocyte-derived dendritic cells,
blood CD1C (188340)-positive dendritic cells, or plasmacytoid dendritic
cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis of B-lymphoblastoid cells, Rudy and Lew
(1997) found that, despite its expression at the cell surface, HLA-DQA2
did not dimerize with HLA-DQB1 (604305) or with any other MHC class II
beta chain examined. Furthermore, HLA-DQA2 did not dimerize with a
selected HLA-DQB1 chain in a transfection system. Rudy and Lew (1997)
found no evidence for expression of an HLA-DQB2 beta chain. HLA-DQA2
did, however, coprecipitate with the invariant chain, Ii (CD74; 142790),
from a B-lymphoblastoid cell lysate.

Using immunoprecipitation, Western blot, and immunofluorescence
analyses, Lenormand et al. (2012) found that human HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2
formed heterodimers that required association with the invariant chain
for transport to early endosomes. Flow cytometry showed that
HLA-DQA2/HLA-DQB2 heterodimers were expressed at the cell surface and
mediated staphylococcal superantigen stimulation of T cells. Lenormand
et al. (2012) proposed that the poorly polymorphic and well-conserved
HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 genes are of immunologic importance and may
influence the complexity of the repertoire of antigens presented by
Langerhans cells.

MAPPING

Rudy and Lew (1997) stated that HLA-DQA2 is the more centromeric of the
2 HLA-DQA genes within the MHC class II complex on chromosome 6p21.3.

;;LONG INTERGENIC NONCODING RNA H19;;
lincRNA H19;;
ADULT SKELETAL MUSCLE GENE; ASM;;
ASM1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The H19 gene encodes a sequence that is not translated and that is
expressed exclusively from the maternal allele (Bartholdi et al., 2009).
The noncoding H19 RNA functions as the primary transcript for
microRNA-675 (MIR675; 615509) (Cai and Cullen, 2007).

CLONING

Leibovitch et al. (1991) used a rat skeletal muscle probe originating
from a rhabdomyosarcoma to isolate a cDNA probe from a human placental
cDNA library. In the rat, while the corresponding mRNA and protein were
not expressed in fetal muscle, an increasing accumulation of the
corresponding mRNA and protein were observed during postnatal
development of skeletal muscle, and this accumulation was maximal in
adulthood. As no expression was found in any other tissue, the gene was
referred to as the adult skeletal muscle (ASM) gene. A gene coding for
an abundant fetal transcript in mice had been identified by Pachnis et
al. (1984), who designated it H19. The H19 gene is expressed in a number
of organs during a restricted period of fetal development, and in
embryonal carcinoma cells after induction of differentiation (Bartolomei
et al., 1991). The gene shows a restricted pattern of expression in
adult tissues; expression is confined to skeletal and cardiac muscle.
Leibovitch et al. (1991) presented evidence that the human H19 gene has
a transcript that gives rise to a 29-kD protein.

Cai and Cullen (2007) determined that the 23-nucleotide MIR675
originates from nucleotides 1014 to 1036 of the noncoding human H19
transcript.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang and Tycko (1992) found restriction site polymorphisms in the human
H19 gene and, by examination of the representation of these
polymorphisms in cDNAs from fetal organs, demonstrated that H19
expression was largely or exclusively from a single allele. Expression
of the WT1 gene (607102), which, like H19, maps to 11p and shows fetal
expression, was found to have biallelic expression. In the context of
previous studies of allelic losses in 11p15 in human embryonal tumors,
the findings of Zhang and Tycko (1992) supported the possibility of
single-step inactivation of monoallelically expressed growth-regulating
genes in human oncogenesis. It was not determined in this study whether
the expression was uniparental to indicate parental imprinting. The H19
gene and 2 other genes, insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2; 147470) and
insulin-like growth factor II receptor (IGF2R; 147280), show monoallelic
expression in mice. IGF2 is, like H19, located in 11p15. Zhang and Tycko
(1992) commented that, if IGF2 also shows monoallelic expression, it may
indicate that that region is a 'hotspot' for this phenomenon.

From the study of the androgenetic complete hydatidiform mole,
Rachmilewitz et al. (1992) presented strong evidence of parental
imprinting of the human H19 gene, with the maternally derived allele as
the active one. Furthermore, they showed that the paternally derived
allele of the IGF2 is expressed. Thus, the situation in the human is the
same as that in the mouse. Rainier et al. (1993) found that both H19 and
IGF2 show monoallelic expression in human tissues and that, as in mouse,
H19 is expressed from the maternal allele and IGF2 from the paternal
allele. In contrast, 69% of Wilms tumors not undergoing loss of
heterozygosity at 11p showed biallelic expression of one or both genes,
suggesting that relaxation or loss of imprinting may represent a new
epigenetic mutational mechanism in carcinogenesis.

Mutter et al. (1993) found that normal gestations express H19 only from
the maternal allele and express IGF2 from the paternal allele, whereas
neither is expressed from the maternal genome of gynogenetic gestations,
and both are expressed from the paternal genome of androgenetic
gestations. Coexpression of H19 and IGF2 in the androgenetic tissues was
in a single population of cells, mononuclear trophoblast--the same cell
type expressing these genes in biparental placentas. These results
demonstrated that a biparental genome may be required for expression of
the reciprocal IGF2/H19 imprint.

In the mouse, the imprinted H19 gene, which encodes an untranslated RNA,
lies at the end of a cluster of imprinted genes. Leighton et al. (1995)
found that imprinting of the insulin-2 gene and the insulin-like growth
factor 2 gene, which lie about 100 kb upstream of H19, can be disrupted
by maternal inheritance of a targeted deletion of the H19 gene and its
flanking sequence. Animals inheriting the H19 mutation from their
mothers were 27% heavier than those inheriting from their fathers.
Paternal inheritance of the disruption had no effect, which presumably
reflects the normally silent state of the paternal gene. The somatic
overgrowth of heterozygotes for the maternal deletion was attributed to
a gain-of-function of the Igf2 gene rather than a loss of function of
H19.

H19 is abundantly expressed in both extraembryonic and fetal tissues.
Jinno et al. (1995) found that H19 is monoallelically (maternally)
expressed in the human placenta after 10 weeks of gestation, whereas it
is biallelically expressed at earlier stages. Regardless of H19
biallelic or monoallelic expression, IGF2 is monoallelically
(paternally) expressed in the placenta. Furthermore, with in situ mRNA
hybridization using placenta showing H19 biallelic and IGF2 monoallelic
expression, they demonstrated that defined cell types simultaneously
contained both H19 and IGF2 transcripts. Therefore, the reciprocal
linkage of H19 and IGF2 expression demonstrated in Wilms tumors is not
observed in placentas. Furthermore, Jinno et al. (1995) found that,
unlike methylation analyses of the human H19 gene, the promoter region
of the human H19 gene is hypomethylated at all stages of placental
development. In contrast, allele-dependent methylation of the 3-prime
portion of the gene increases with gestational age.

H19 is a developmentally regulated gene with putative tumor suppressor
activity; it had been hypothesized that loss of H19 expression may be
involved in Wilms tumorigenesis. Han et al. (1996) performed in situ
hybridization analysis of H19 expression during normal rabbit
development and in human atherosclerotic plaques. They found that H19
expression in developing skeletal and smooth muscles correlated with
specific differentiation events in these tissues. Expression of H19 in
skeletal muscle correlated with nonproliferative, actin-positive muscle
cells. In the prenatal blood vessel, H19 expression was both temporally
and spatially regulated with initial loss of expression in the inner
smooth muscle layers adjacent to the lumen. Han et al. (1996) also
identified H19-positive cells in adult atherosclerotic lesions,
suggesting that these cells may recapitulate early developmental events.
These results, along with the identification of the insulin family of
growth factors as potent regulatory molecules for H19 expression,
provided additional clues toward understanding the physiologic
regulation and function of H19.

Pfeifer et al. (1996) stated that the product of the H19 gene is an
untranslated RNA that is expressed exclusively from the maternal
chromosome during mammalian development. The H19 gene and its
5-prime-flanking sequence are required for the genomic imprinting of 2
paternally expressed genes in mice, Ins2 and Igf2, that lie 90 and 115
kb 5-prime to the H19 gene, respectively. Pfeifer et al. (1996)
investigated the role of the H19 gene in its own imprinting by
introducing a Mus spretus H19 gene into heterologous locations in the
mouse genome. They found that multiple copies of the transgene were
sufficient for its paternal silencing and DNA methylation. Replacing the
H19 structural gene with a luciferase reporter gene resulted in loss of
imprinting of the transgene; that is, high expression and low levels of
DNA methylation were observed with both paternal and maternal
inheritance. Removal of 701 bp at the 5-prime end of the structural H19
gene resulted in a similar loss of paternal-specific DNA methylation,
arguing that those sequences are required for both the establishment and
maintenance of the sperm-specific gametic mark. The M. spretus H19
transgene could not rescue the loss of IGF2 imprinting in trans in H19
deletion mice, implying a cis requirement for the H19 gene. In contrast
to a previous report (Brunkow and Tilghman, 1991) in which
overexpression of a marked H19 gene was a prenatal lethal, Pfeifer et
al. (1996) found that expression of the M. spretus transgene had no
deleterious effect, leading them to conclude that the 20-bp insertion in
the marked gene created a neomorphic mutation.

Genes expressed during embryogenesis, downregulated with tissue
maturation and reexpressed in cancer, are designated oncofetal genes,
and many of them are used as tumor markers. Ariel et al. (1997) showed
oncofetal expression of H19 in human cancer. The study of H19 expression
in testicular germ cell tumors of adolescents and young adults, which
follow lines of differentiation of the conceptus, demonstrated
dissociation between level of expression and monoallelic versus
biallelic expression, which are 2 independent oncofetal characteristics
of cancer. Ariel et al. (2000) reported that H19 is abundantly expressed
in the fetal bladder mucosa and in carcinoma of the urinary bladder. It
could be used as a marker of early recurrence and potentially as the
basis for gene therapy.

The expression of the IGF2 (147470) and H19 genes is imprinted. Although
these neighboring genes share an enhancer, H19 is expressed only from
the maternal allele, and IGF2 only from the paternally inherited allele.
The region of paternal-specific methylation upstream of H19 appears to
be the site of an epigenetic mark that is required for the imprinting of
these genes. A deletion within this region results in loss of imprinting
of both H19 and IGF2 (Thorvaldsen et al., 1998). Bell and Felsenfeld
(2000) showed that this methylated region contains an element that
blocks enhancer activity. The activity of this element is dependent upon
the vertebrate enhancer-blocking protein CTCF (604167). Methylation of
CpGs within the CTCF binding sites eliminates binding of CTCF in vitro,
and deletion of these sites results in loss of enhancer-blocking
activity in vivo, thereby allowing gene expression. This CTCF-dependent
enhancer-blocking element acts as an insulator. Bell and Felsenfeld
(2000) suggested that it controls imprinting of IGF2. The activity of
this insulator is restricted to the maternal allele by specific DNA
methylation of the paternal allele. Bell and Felsenfeld (2000) concluded
that DNA methylation can control gene expression by modulating enhancer
access to the gene promoter through regulation of an enhancer boundary.

The unmethylated imprinted-control region (ICR) acts as a chromatin
boundary that blocks the interaction of IGF2 with enhancers that lie
3-prime of H19 (Webber et al., 1998; Hark and Tilghman, 1998). This
enhancer-blocking activity would then be lost when the region was
methylated, thereby allowing expression of IGF2 paternally. Using
transgenic mice and tissue culture, Hark et al. (2000) demonstrated that
the unmethylated ICRs from mouse and human H19 exhibit enhancer-blocking
activity. They showed that CTCF binds to several sites in the
unmethylated ICR that are essential for enhancer blocking. Consistent
with this model, CTCF binding is abolished by DNA methylation. Within
the human ICR, there is a CpG-rich 45-basepair sequence in B repeats
that is 60% identical to 2 sites in the hypersensitive region HS1 and 3
sites in HS2. Within this is a 14-basepair core that has a high degree
of similarity to a binding site for CTCF (FII) within the chicken
beta-globin insulator. Hark et al. (2000) demonstrated that DNA
methylation inhibited binding of CTCF to human B1 sites and showed that
CTCF sites are not symmetric, and that the protein makes important
contacts with some of the cytosine residues on the top DNA strand.

H19 and IGF2 are expressed in a monoallelic fashion from the maternal
and paternal chromosomes, respectively. A region upstream of H19 has
been shown to regulate such imprinted expression of both genes in cis.
Srivastava et al. (2000) used a loxP/cre recombinase-based strategy to
delete this region in mice in a conditional manner to determine the
temporal requirement of the upstream region in initiating and
maintaining the imprinted expression of H19 and Igf2. Analysis of
allele-specific expression of H19 and Igf2 and DNA methylation at the
H19 promoter demonstrated that this region controls the monoallelic
expression of the 2 genes in different ways, suggesting that it harbors
2 functionally distinct regulatory elements. Continued presence of the
region is required to silence maternal Igf2 in accordance with its
proposed role as an insulator. However, it does not have a direct role
in keeping the paternal H19 promoter silenced. Instead, on the paternal
chromosome, the upstream element mediates epigenetic modifications of
the H19 promoter region during development, leading to transcriptional
silencing of H19. Thereafter, its presence is redundant for preventing
transcription. This temporal requirement of the silencing element
appears to be a unique cis activity in the mammalian system. However, it
is likely that other cis-acting elements, positive and negative, have
the ability to effect stable changes in the chromatin structure and are
not constantly required to give signals to the transcriptional
machinery.

Davis et al. (2000) analyzed the allelic methylation patterns of the
maternally expressed, paternally methylated H19 gene during
gametogenesis in the mouse embryo. Both parental alleles were devoid of
methylation in male and female midgestation embryonic germ cells,
suggesting that methylation imprints are erased in the germ cells prior
to this time. In addition, the subsequent hypermethylation of the
paternal and maternal alleles in the male germline occurred at different
times. Although the paternal allele became hypermethylated during fetal
stages, methylation of the maternal allele began during perinatal stages
and continued postnatally through the onset of meiosis. The differential
acquisition of methylation on the parental H19 alleles during
gametogenesis may imply that the 2 unmethylated alleles can still be
distinguished from each other. The authors concluded that in the absence
of DNA methylation, other epigenetic mechanisms may maintain parental
identity at the H19 locus during male germ cell development.

Takai et al. (2001) found that all the CTCF (604167)-binding sites in
H19 except for the sixth were hypermethylated, whereas only the sixth
binding site showed allele-specific methylation in normal human
embryonic ureteral tissue. In human-mouse somatic-cell-hybrid clones
containing a single copy of human chromosome 11, they observed a
correlation between methylation of the sixth CTCF-binding site and
expression of IGF2. The authors also reported hypomethylation of the
paternal allele in 2 of 6 informative cases of human bladder cancer. The
authors proposed that only the sixth CTCF-binding site may act as a key
regulatory domain for switching between H19 or IGF2 expression.

In the mouse, the H19 promoter area is methylated when transcription of
the H19 gene is silent and unmethylated when it is active. Gao et al.
(2002) used PCR-based methylation analysis and bisulfite genomic
sequencing to study the cytosine methylation status of the H19 promoter
region in 16 normal adrenals and 30 pathologic adrenocortical samples.
PCR-based analysis showed higher methylation status at 3 HpaII-cutting
CpG sites of the H19 promoter in adrenocortical carcinomas and in a
virilizing adenoma than in their adjacent normal adrenal tissues.
Bisulfite genomic sequencing revealed a significantly higher mean degree
of methylation at each of 12 CpG sites of the H19 promoter in
adrenocortical carcinomas than in normal adrenals (P less than 0.01 for
all sites) or adrenocortical adenomas (P less than 0.01, except P less
than 0.05 for site 12 and P greater than 0.05 for site 11). The mean
methylation degree of the 12 CpG sites was significantly higher in the
adrenocortical carcinomas than in normal adrenals or adrenocortical
adenomas (P less than 0.005). The mean methylation degree of the 12 H19
promoter CpG sites correlated negatively with H19 RNA levels but
positively with IGF2 mRNA levels. Treatment with a cytosine methylation
inhibitor, 5-aza-2-prime-deoxycytidine, increased H19 RNA expression,
whereas it decreased IGF2 mRNA accumulation dose- and time-dependently
(both P less than 0.005) and reduced cell proliferation to 10% in 7
days. The authors concluded that altered DNA methylation of the H19
promoter is involved in the abnormal expression of both H19 and IGF2
genes in human adrenocortical carcinomas.

The most common constitutional abnormalities found in Beckwith-Wiedemann
syndrome are epigenetic, involving abnormal methylation of either H19 or
LIT1 (604115), both of which encode untranslated RNAs on 11p15. DeBaun
et al. (2002) hypothesized that different epigenetic alterations would
be associated with specific phenotypes in BWS. To test this hypothesis,
they performed a case-cohort study, using the BWS Registry. The cohort
consisted of 92 patients with BWS who had had molecular analysis of both
H19 and LIT1; these patients showed the same frequency of clinical
phenotypes as those patients in the Registry from whom biologic samples
were not available. The frequency of altered DNA methylation in H19 in
patients with cancer was significantly higher, 56% (9/16), than the
frequency in patients without cancer, 17% (13/76; P = 0.002), and cancer
was not associated with LIT1 alterations. Furthermore, the frequency of
altered DNA methylation of LIT1 in patients with midline abdominal wall
defects and macrosomia was significantly higher, 65% (41/63) and 60%
(46/77), respectively, than in patients without such defects, 34%
(10/29) and 18% (2/11), respectively (P = 0.012 and P = 0.02,
respectively). Additionally, paternal uniparental disomy of 11p15 was
associated with hemihypertrophy (P = 0.003), cancer (P = 0.03), and
hypoglycemia (P = 0.05). These results defined an epigenotype-phenotype
relationship in BWS in which aberrant methylation of H19 and LIT1 and
UPD are strongly associated with cancer risk and specific birth defects.

Du et al. (2003) confirmed the existence of insulators in the H19
differentially methylated region (DMR) and reported 2 insulators in the
IGF2 gene. They also identified 2 novel silencer sequences: 1 in KvDMR,
a region that is thought to contain the promoter for the KCNQ1OT1
transcript, and the other in the CDKN1C gene (600856). The authors
demonstrated binding of the zinc-finger protein CTCF in vitro to all the
insulator and silencer sequences detected.

Ulaner et al. (2003) showed that osteosarcoma tumors with IGF2/H19
maintenance of imprinting (MOI) exhibited allele-specific differential
methylation of a CTCF-binding site upstream of H19. Loss of imprinting
(LOI) of IGF2 or H19 in OS occurred in a mutually exclusive manner and
occurred with monoallelic expression of the other gene. Bisulfite
sequencing revealed that IGF2 LOI occurred with biallelic CpG
methylation of the CTCF-binding site, while H19 LOI occurred with
biallelic hypomethylation of this site. The authors proposed a model in
which incomplete gain or loss of methylation at this CTCF-binding site
during tumorigenesis may explain the complex and often conflicting
expression patterns of IGF2 and H19 in tumors.

Sandovici et al. (2003) examined allelic methylation ratios at DMRs
within the IGF2/H19 and IGF2R loci in a panel of 48 3-generation
families. There was familial clustering of individuals with abnormal
methylation ratios at the IGF2/H19 DMR, as well as stability of this
trait over a period of nearly 2 decades, consistent with the possibility
that constitutional LOI at this locus may be due largely to genetic
factors. At the IGF2R DMR, more variability in the allelic methylation
ratios was observed over time, but there was also familial clustering of
abnormal methylation ratios. Sandovici et al. (2003) concluded that
shared genetic factors may be responsible for a major fraction of
interindividual variability in parental origin-dependent epigenetic
modifications; however, temporal changes also occur in isolated cases,
as well as within multiple individuals in the same family, indicating
that environmental factors may also play a role.

Fedoriw et al. (2004) used a transgenic RNA interference (RNAi)-based
approach to generate oocytes with reduced amounts of CTCF protein, and
found increased methylation of the H19 differentially methylated domain
and decreased developmental competence of CTCF-deficient oocytes.
Fedoriw et al. (2004) concluded that CTCF protects H19 differentially
methylated domain from de novo methylation during oocyte growth and is
required for normal preimplantation development.

By analyzing 3 deletions of the H19 locus, Vernucci et al. (2004)
investigated the mechanism regulating imprinted expression of the Igf2
gene during liver tumorigenesis in mouse embryos. The role of the H19
DMR in controlling Igf2 expression changed during tumorigenesis. The H19
DMR was required on the paternal chromosome for Igf2 activation in the
early stages, while its maternal allele was necessary for maintaining
Igf2 imprinting only in the late stages. A positive regulatory function
for paternal H19 DMR was also evident in normal neonatal liver, but its
relevance for Igf2 expression became higher in the second postnatal
week. Vernucci et al. (2004) proposed a model in which both methylated
and nonmethylated parental copies of the H19 DMR have active roles in
regulating Igf2 expression in the liver, and these activities are under
developmental control.

Gene transcription may be regulated by remote enhancer or insulator
regions through chromosome looping. Using a modification of chromosome
conformation capture and fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ling et al.
(2006) found that 1 allele of the Igf2/H19 imprinting control region
(ICR) on mouse chromosome 7 colocalized with 1 allele of Wsb1
(610091)/Nf1 (613113) on chromosome 11. Omission of Ctcf (604167) or
deletion of the maternal ICR abrogated this association and altered
Wsb1/Nf1 gene expression. Ling et al. (2006) concluded that their
findings demonstrated that CTCF mediates an interchromosomal
association, perhaps by directing distant DNA segments to a common
transcription factory, and the data provided a model for long-range
allele-specific associations between gene regions on different
chromosomes that suggested a framework for DNA recombination and RNA
trans-splicing.

Using real-time PCR, Dudek et al. (2010) found comparably high
expression of Mir675, H19, and the master chondrocyte regulator Sox9
(608160) in adult mouse cartilage. Expression of H19, MIR675, SOX9, and
collagen-2A1 (COL2A1; 120140) decreased with increasing passage number
in chondrocytes cultured from juvenile and adult human articular
cartilage. Depletion of SOX9 or H19 in human chondrocytes significantly
reduced COL2A1 mRNA content and COL2A1 protein secretion. Overexpression
of MIR675 reversed the effects of SOX9 or H19 depletion. Dudek et al.
(2010) concluded that SOX9 functions through H19-derived MIR675 to
increase COL2A1 expression in chondrocytes, possibly by inhibiting
expression of a COL2A1 repressor.

NOMO1 (609157) antagonizes NODAL signaling (601265), which is critical
for regulation of trophoblast cell growth. Gao et al. (2012) found that
H19-derived MIR675 suppressed cell proliferation and promoted
NODAL-mediated SMAD2 (601366) phosphorylation in human trophoblastic
JEG-3 cells by directly inhibiting NOMO1 mRNA translation.
Overexpression of NOMO1 reversed these effects. Knockdown of H19 or
inhibition of MIR675 increased NOMO1 protein expression and promoted
JEG-3 cell proliferation.

Venkatraman et al. (2013) demonstrated upregulation of
growth-restricting imprinted genes, including in the H19-Igf2 (147470)
locus, in long-term hematopoietic stem cells and their downregulation
upon hematopoietic stem cell activation and proliferation. A
differentially methylated region upstream of H19 (H19-DMR), serving as
the imprinting control region, determines the reciprocal expression of
H19 from the maternal allele and Igf2 from the paternal allele. In
addition, H19 serves as a source of miR675, which restricts Igf1r
(147370) expression (Keniry et al., 2012). Venkatraman et al. (2013)
demonstrated that conditional deletion of the maternal but not the
paternal H19-DMR reduces adult hematopoietic stem cell quiescence, a
state required for long-term maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells,
and compromised hematopoietic stem cell function. Maternal-specific
H19-DMR deletion results in activation of the Igf2-Igfr1 pathway, as
shown by the translocation of phosphorylated FoxO3 (602681), an inactive
form, from nucleus to cytoplasm and the release of FoxO3-mediated cell
cycle arrest, thus leading to increased activation, proliferation, and
eventual exhaustion of hematopoietic stem cells. Mechanistically,
maternal-specific H19-DMR deletion leads to Igf2 upregulation and
increased translation of Igf1r, which is normally suppressed by
H19-derived miR675. Similarly, genetic inactivation of Igf1r partly
rescues the H19-DMR deletion phenotype. Venkatraman et al. (2013)
concluded that their work established a role for this form of epigenetic
control at the H19-Igf2 locus in maintaining adult stem cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

The human H19 gene is 2.7 kb long and includes 4 small introns (Brannan
et al., 1990).

Gao et al. (2012) stated that exon 1 of the H19 gene contains MIR675.

MAPPING

Leibovitch et al. (1991) mapped the human gene to 11p15 by a combination
of somatic hybrid cell analysis and in situ hybridization. (D11S813E was
the designation assigned by HGM11 (Nguyen et al., 1991).)

In the mouse, the H19 gene is located on chromosome 7 in a region of
conservation of synteny with human 11p (Jones et al., 1992). Like the
H19 gene, the Igf2 gene is imprinted in the mouse, although in the
opposite parents, one paternally imprinted, the other maternally. Zemel
et al. (1992) showed that the Igf2 gene lies about 90 kb 5-prime to H19,
in the same transcriptional orientation. Based on similar pulsed field
gel analysis, they showed that this physical proximity is conserved in
humans. Both genes hybridized to a fragment of about 200 kb. Zemel et
al. (1992) proposed a model to account for the imprinting of 2 linked
genes in opposite directions, i.e., one (H19) being paternally imprinted
and the other (IGF2) maternally imprinted. They pointed out that the
IGF2/H19 domain is a candidate for the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS;
130650) since the genes show imprinting and chimeric mouse embryos that
are paternally disomic for distal mouse chromosome 7 show an overgrowth
phenotype similar to that of BWS (Ferguson-Smith et al., 1991).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome

In mice, a targeted deletion showed that imprinting of the paternally
expressed Igf2 and maternally expressed H19 genes is controlled by a
2-kb DMR located 5-prime of H19 (Thorvaldsen et al., 1998). The H19 DMR
sequence in the human differs from the homologous mouse region in that
it is organized into 2 repeat units, each consisting of 2 types of
direct repeats, and containing 7 potential binding sites for CTCF.
Sparago et al. (2004) analyzed 7 individuals with Beckwith-Wiedemann
syndrome (BWS; 130650) and H19 hypermethylation for the presence of
deletions in the H19 DMR and showed that inherited microdeletions in the
H19 DMR that abolish 2 CTCF target sites cause this disorder. Maternal
transmission of the deletions resulted in hypermethylation of the H19
DMR, biallelic IGF2 expression, H19 silencing, and BWS syndrome,
indicative of loss of function of the IGF2/H19 imprinting control
element.

In 3 sibs with BWS and Wilms tumor and 2 unaffected sibs from a
3-generation family, Prawitt et al. (2005) identified a 2.2-kbp
microdeletion in the H19/IGF2 imprinting center-1 which abolished 3 CTCF
(604167) target sites. Maternal inheritance of the deletion was
associated with IGF2 loss of imprinting and upregulation of IGF2 mRNA.
However, in at least 1 affected family member a second lesion was
identified, duplication of maternal 11p15, which was accompanied by a
further increase in IGF2 mRNA levels (35-fold higher than control
values). Prawitt et al. (2005) suggested that the combined effects of
the BWSIC1 microdeletion and 11p15 duplication were necessary for the
manifestation of BWS in this family.

- Silver-Russell Syndrome

Hypermethylation of the H19 DMR--and subsequently of the H19 promoter
region--is a major cause of the clinical features of gigantism and/or
asymmetry seen in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or in isolated
hemihypertrophy (235000). Bliek et al. (2006) demonstrated complete
hypomethylation of the H19 promoter in 2 of 3 patients with the full
clinical spectrum of Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS; 180860), which shows
clinical features opposite to those seen in patients with
hypermethylation of this region.

Bartholdi et al. (2009) observed hypomethylation at the imprinting
control region-1 (ICR1) on chromosome 11p15 in 41 (38.5%) of 106
patients with Silver-Russell syndrome. The majority of patients showed
hypomethylation of both H19 and IGF2, but 10 showed selective
hypomethylation of H19, and 2 showed selective hypomethylation of IGF2.

- Wilms Tumor

Scott et al. (2008) identified constitutional abnormalities at
chromosome 11p15 in 13 (3%) of 437 individuals with sporadic Wilms tumor
without features of overgrowth syndromes (WT2; 194071). Six patients had
paternal uniparental disomy of 11p15 and 6 had hypermethylation at the
H19 differentially methylated region (DMR). There were 2 familial cases.
In 1 family, 2 sibs had a microdeletion of the H19 DMR (103280.0002)
that was inherited from the unaffected mother; 1 sib had isolated Wilms
tumor and the other had features of BWS. In a second family, a mother
and 2 daughters had a microinsertion in the H19 DMR (103280.0003),
inherited from the unaffected grandmother. No abnormalities were
detected in 220 controls. Analysis of tumor tissue showed that the level
of H19 DMR hypermethylation was greater in tumor compared to
lymphocytes, suggesting that the tumors developed by clonal expansion of
cells harboring the 11p15 defect. There was no evidence of additional
tumor-specific 11p15 abnormalities affecting the wildtype allele.

ANIMAL MODEL

Jones et al. (2001) described a 12-kb deletion of a region 5-prime of
the imprinting control region (ICR) that was hypersensitive to nuclease
digestion in chromatin. Its deletion resulted in a biallelic decrease in
expression of Igf2, but not H19, in the brains of transgenic mice,
consistent with the hypothesis that it encodes a positive regulatory
element. In addition, the deletion resulted in a minor relaxation of
Igf2 imprinting in skeletal muscle and tongue. Lastly, the reduction in
Igf2 expression in the adult mouse was accompanied by increased fat
deposition and occasional obesity. Overweight animals were hypophagic,
suggesting that Igf2 affects fat metabolism rather than feeding behavior
in adult mice.

Lopes et al. (2003) examined regional control of DNA methylation in the
imprinted Igf2-H19 region in the mouse. Paternal germline-specific
methylation was reprogrammed after fertilization in 2 differentially
methylated regions (DMRs) in Igf2, and was reestablished after
implantation. Using a number of knockout strains in the region, the
authors found that the DMRs themselves are involved in regional
coordination in a hierarchical fashion. Thus the H19 DMR was needed on
the maternal allele to protect the Igf2 DMRs 1 and 2 from methylation,
and Igf2 DMR1 was needed to protect DMR2 from methylation. This regional
coordination occurred exclusively after fertilization during somatic
development, and did not involve linear spreading of DNA methylation,
suggesting a model in which long-range chromatin interactions are
involved in regional epigenetic coordination. Parthenogenesis does not
naturally occur in mammals because of the need for unequal expression of
imprinted genes from the maternal and paternal alleles.

Cerrato et al. (2003) showed that in the mouse mutant 'minute' (Mnt),
which carries a 3-Mb inversion with a breakpoint 25 kb distal to the H19
gene, the Igf2-H19 locus acquired a paternal methylation imprint in the
maternal germline. DNA methylation of the H19 DMR was established in
oogenesis, maintained during postzygotic development on the maternal
allele, and erased in primordial germ cells. The fact that a
paternal-type methylation imprint can also be established in the
maternal germline suggests that trans-acting factors that target
methylation to this imprinted region may likely be the same in both
germlines. However, asynchrony of DNA replication of the locus was
maintained despite the altered expression and methylation imprint of
Igf2 and H19. Cerrato et al. (2003) concluded that replication
asynchrony of this region is neither the determinant factor for, nor a
consequence of, epigenetic modifications that are critical for genomic
imprinting. Replication asynchrony may thus be regulated differently
from methylation imprints and have a separate function.

Kono et al. (2004) showed the development of a viable parthenogenetic
mouse individual from a reconstructed oocyte containing 2 haploid sets
of maternal genome derived from nongrowing and fully grown oocytes. This
development was made possible by the appropriate expression of IGF2 and
H19 genes with other imprinted genes, using mutant mice with a 13-kb
deletion in the H19 gene that included the differentially methylated
domain (Leighton et al., 1995), as the nongrowing oocyte donors. The 2
parthenotes that survived to term had marked reduction in aberrantly
expressed genes. One parthenote developed to adulthood with the ability
to reproduce offspring. Kono et al. (2004) concluded that paternal
imprinting prevents parthenogenesis, ensuring that the paternal
contribution is obligatory for the descendant. Another startling
observation of this study by Kono et al. (2004) is that the appropriate
expression of the IGF2 and H19 genes caused the modification of a wide
range of genes and normal development in the surviving parthenotes. The
better development may have led to altered signaling which then affected
the expression of many other genes. However, the underlying mechanism
was not clear.

Imprinted expression at the H19/IGF2 locus depends on a differentially
methylated domain (DMD) that acts both as a maternal-specific,
methylation-sensitive insulator and as a paternal-specific site of
hypermethylation. Four repeats in the DMD bind CTCF on the maternal
allele and may attract methylation on the paternal allele. In mice,
Engel et al. (2004) introduced point mutations into the DMD to deplete
the repeats of CpGs while retaining Ctcf-binding and enhancer-blocking
activity. Maternal inheritance of the mutations left H19 expression and
Igf2 imprinting intact, consistent with the idea that the DMD acts as an
insulator. Conversely, paternal inheritance of these mutations disrupted
maintenance of DMD methylation, resulting in biallelic H19 expression.
Furthermore, an insulator was established on the paternally inherited
mutated allele in vivo, reducing Igf2 expression and resulting in a 40%
reduction in size of newborn offspring. Engel et al. (2004) concluded
that the 9 CpG mutations in the DMD showed that the 2 parental-specific
roles of the H19 DMD, i.e., methylation maintenance and insulator
assembly, are antagonistic.

Imprinted genes are expressed from only 1 of the parental alleles and
are marked epigenetically by DNA methylation and histone modifications.
The paternally expressed gene Igf2 is separated by approximately 100 kb
from the maternally expressed noncoding gene H19 on mouse distal
chromosome 7. Differentially methylated regions in Igf2 and H19 contain
chromatin boundaries, silencers, and activators, and regulate the
reciprocal expression of the 2 genes in a methylation-sensitive manner
by allowing them exclusive access to a shared set of enhancers. Murrell
et al. (2004) used a GAL4 knockin approach as well as the chromosome
conformation capture technique to show that the differentially
methylated regions in the imprinted genes Igf2 and H19 interact in mice.
These interactions are genetically regulated and partition maternal and
paternal chromatin into distinct loops. This generates a simple
epigenetic switch for Igf2 through which it moves between an active and
a silent chromatin domain.

Comparisons between eutherians and marsupials have suggested limited
conservation of the molecular mechanisms that control genomic imprinting
in mammals. Smits et al. (2008) studied the evolution of the imprinted
IGF2 (147470)-H19 locus in therians. Although marsupial orthologs of
protein-coding exons were easily identified, the use of evolutionarily
conserved regions and low-stringency Bl2seq comparisons was required to
delineate a candidate H19 noncoding RNA sequence. The therian H19
orthologs showed miR675 and exon structure conservation, suggesting
functional selection on both features. Transcription start site
sequences and poly(A) signals are also conserved. As in eutherians,
marsupial H19 is maternally expressed and paternal methylation upstream
of the gene originates in the male germline, encompasses a CTCF (604167)
insulator, and spreads somatically into the H19 gene. Smits et al.
(2008) concluded that the conservation in all therians of the mechanism
controlling imprinting of the IGF2-H19 locus suggests a sequential model
of imprinting evolution.

Superovulation (ovarian stimulation) is an assisted reproductive
technology (ART) for human subfertility/infertility treatment, which has
been correlated with increased frequencies of imprinting disorders such
as Angelman (105830) and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes. Market-Velker et
al. (2010) examined the effects of superovulation on genomic imprinting
in individual mouse blastocyst stage embryos. Superovulation perturbed
genomic imprinting of both maternally and paternally expressed genes.
Loss of Snrpn (182279), Peg3 (601483), and Kcnq1ot1 (604115) and gain of
H19 imprinted methylation were observed. This perturbation was
dose-dependent, with aberrant imprinted methylation more frequent at
higher hormone dosage. Maternal as well as paternal H19 methylation was
perturbed by superovulation. Market-Velker et al. (2010) postulated that
superovulation may have dual effects during oogenesis, disrupting
acquisition of imprints in growing oocytes, as well as maternal-effect
gene products subsequently required for imprint maintenance during
preimplantation development.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BECKWITH-WIEDEMANN SYNDROME
H19, 1.8-KB DEL

Sparago et al. (2004) analyzed 7 individuals with Beckwith-Wiedemann
syndrome (BWS; 130650) with H19 hypermethylation for the presence of
deletions in the H19 differentially methylated region (DMR). In 2
individuals, they found an allele with a 1.8-kb deletion. The 2
mutations were very similar, each deleting 2.5 copies of the B repeat
and 1 copy of the A repeat and abolishing 2 CTCF binding sites. The
sister of 1 patient died prenatally with signs of BWS. Study of DNA from
the autopsy specimen showed that she also had inherited the 1.8-kb
deletion from her mother. The mutation was found in the mother of these
2 sibs, in the maternal grandfather, and in an uncle and his daughters.
In the second family, Sparago et al. (2004) found the mutation in the
mother, maternal aunt, and maternal grandfather, indicating that the
1.8-kb deletion is associated with the BWS phenotype only when
maternally transmitted. The 1.8-kb deletion was not detected in any of
14 individuals with BWS with defects other than H19 methylation or in
any of 50 healthy individuals.

It is believed that chromosomes interact with each other to regulate
transcription in trans. To explore systematically the epigenetic
dimension of such interactions, Zhao et al. (2006) devised a strategy
termed circular chromosome conformation capture (4C). This approach
enabled high-throughput screening of physical interactions between
chromosomes without a preconceived idea of the interacting partners. The
authors identified 114 unique sequences from all autosomes, several of
which interact primarily with the maternally inherited H19 imprinting
control region. Imprinted domains were strongly overrepresented in the
library of 4C sequences, further highlighting the epigenetic nature of
these interactions. Moreover, Zhao et al. (2006) found that the direct
interaction between differentially methylated regions was linked to
epigenetic regulation of transcription in trans. They found that the
patterns of interactions specific to the maternal H19 imprinting control
region underwent reprogramming during in vitro maturation of embryonic
stem cells.

WILMS TUMOR 2
BECKWITH-WIEDEMANN SYNDROME, INCLUDED
H19, 5.3-KB DEL

In a patient with isolated Wilms tumor (194071), Scott et al. (2008)
identified a 5.3-kb deletion encompassing all but the telomeric 200 bp
of the H19 differentially methylated region (DMR) repeat block,
resulting in hypermethylation. The mutation deleted 6 of 7 CTCF (604167)
target sites. The mutation was inherited from the unaffected mother. A
sib with overgrowth features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (130650)
also carried the mutation.

WILMS TUMOR 2
H19, 1.43-KB TRIPLICATION

In 3 members of a family with isolated Wilms tumor (194071), Scott et
al. (2008) identified a 1.43-kb triplication in the H19 differentially
methylated region (DMR), resulting in hypermethylation. The mutation was
inherited from the unaffected maternal grandmother. The triplication
appeared as a 2.9-kb microinsertion and did not disrupt predicted CTCF
(604167) target sites, but inserted 2 predicted CTCF target sites
between the 2 H19 DMR repeat blocks.

603048	TITLE *603048 GLYCOSYLPHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL ANCHOR ATTACHMENT PROTEIN 1; GPAA1
;;GAA1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) is a membrane anchor for cell surface
proteins. GPAA1 is a subunit of the GPI transamidase complex that
catalyzes the attachment of preformed GPI to proteins containing a
C-terminal GPI attachment signal (Vainauskas et al., 2002).

CLONING

A number of mutants defective in different steps of the GPI biosynthetic
pathway and unable to express GPI-anchored proteins have been described
in both yeast and mammals, and many of the affected genes have been
identified. In yeast, the gaa1 mutant can synthesize complete GPI
precursors, but it cannot express GPI-anchored proteins on its cell
surface. Using a mouse embryonic body cDNA isolated by the signal
sequence trap method, Hiroi et al. (1998) cloned the human homolog of
yeast gaa1. The human cDNA, isolated from a heart cDNA library, encodes
a predicted 621-amino acid protein with 25% identity to the yeast Gaa1
protein. Human GAA1 contains an N-terminal signal sequence, 1 cAMP- and
cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site, 1 leucine zipper
pattern, 2 potential N-glycosylation sites, and 8 putative transmembrane
domains. Northern blot analysis detected an approximately 2-kb GAA1
transcript in all examined human fetal and adult tissues. In mouse
embryonic bodies, mRNA levels were high in the undifferentiated state
and gradually decreased with development.

Vainauskas et al. (2002) determined that GAA1 is an endoplasmic
reticulum (ER)-localized membrane glycoprotein with a cytoplasmically
oriented N terminus and a luminally oriented C terminus.

GENE FUNCTION

Hiroi et al. (1998) found that overexpression of human antisense GAA1
cDNA by transient transfection strongly inhibited the expression of a
GPI-anchored protein reporter; overexpression of sense GAA1 cDNA did not
have a significant effect. Hiroi et al. (1998) suggested that human GAA1
presumably functions in GPI anchoring at the GPI transfer step, as had
been shown for the yeast Gaa1 protein.

By analyzing GAA1 mutants, Vainauskas et al. (2002) determined that the
C-terminal transmembrane segment did not affect the interaction of GAA1
with other GPI transamidase components, but inclusion of truncated GAA1
resulted in a nonfunctional complex. The large luminal domain of GAA1,
located between the first and second transmembrane segments, mediated
the interaction between GAA1 and other subunits, and the N terminus
appeared to direct the association of GAA1 and other transaminase
subunits to an ER membrane domain. By truncation analysis, Vainauskas
and Menon (2005) determined that retention of GAA1 in the ER is passive
and not controlled by an ER retention signal within the molecule.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid analysis,
Hiroi et al. (1998) mapped the GPAA1 gene to chromosome 8q24.

In the mouse, Klages et al. (1994) reported the molecular cloning and
preliminary functional characterization of a nonreceptor protein
tyrosine kinase (PTK) that is related to CSK (124095). This PTK,
designated Ctk for CSK-type protein-tyrosine kinase, was found to be a
52-kD protein expressed primarily in brain and predicted to be
structurally similar to CSK. Klages et al. (1994) found that, like CSK,
Ctk can phosphorylate members of the SRC family of PTKs at the
regulatory tyrosine residue. Thus, Ctk and CSK define a family of
kinases that phosphorylate carboxy-terminal regulatory tyrosine
residues.

Protein-tyrosine kinases play major roles in signal transduction
pathways. Bennett et al. (1994) cloned a novel tyrosine kinase, termed
megakaryoctye-associated tyrosine kinase (MATK), from a human
megakaryocyte cDNA library using degenerate PCR. The MATK cDNA encodes a
527-amino acid protein that shows 50% amino acid identity to CSK and has
the structural features of the CSK subfamily: SRC homology SH (2) and
SH3 domains, a catalytic domain, a unique N terminus, lack of
myristylation signals, lack of a negative regulatory phosphorylation
site, and lack of an autophosphorylation site. Bennett et al. (1994)
localized the MATK protein to the cytoplasm of megakaryocytic cells
using immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis of subcellular
fractions. They showed by Northern blot analysis that the MATK gene is
expressed abundantly in megakaryocytes and at a lower level in adult
brain as a 2.3-kb transcript; it was not detectably expressed in any
other examined tissue. Bennett et al. (1994) found that MATK expression
is upregulated in megakaryocytic cells that are induced to differentiate
by phorbol ester. They suggested that MATK functions in signal
transduction pathways that are important in megakaryocyte growth and/or
differentiation.

Using PCR, Sakano et al. (1994) identified MATK as HYL from a human
megakaryoblastic cell line.

GENE FUNCTION

Avraham et al. (1995) showed that MATK can phosphorylate the SRC
(176947) protein in vitro.

Zrihan-Licht et al. (1997) reported that MATK is expressed in human
breast cancer but not in the adjacent normal breast tissues, suggesting
that MATK might be involved in signaling in some cases of breast cancer.
Zrihan-Licht et al. (1997) demonstrated that MATK interacts with ErbB-2
(164870) in vivo upon heregulin stimulation and that this interaction
occurs via the SH2 domain of MATK.

MAPPING

Sakano et al. (1994) localized the MATK gene to chromosome 19p13.3 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Avraham et al. (1995) mapped the
MATK gene to chromosome 19 using somatic cell hybrids and found that the
murine Matk gene maps within a region of synteny on chromosome 10.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Merberg et al. (1993) first detected megakaryocyte-stimulating factor
(MSF) in the urine of patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation
during a period of acute thrombocytopenia. Subsequent cloning studies
demonstrated that this 20- to 25-kD urinary metabolite of MSF was an
N-terminal cysteine-rich polypeptide component derived from a larger,
highly glycosylated precursor protein of approximately 400 kD. The
smaller urinary metabolite was shown to stimulate growth in both pure
and mixed megakaryocyte colonies from bone marrow fibrin cultures. MSF
precursor is a multifunctional domain protein with polypeptide sequence
homologies to both serum adhesive glycoproteins and secretory mucins
(see 158370). Articular cartilage MSF precursor contains large (76 to 78
repeats) and small (6 to 8 repeats) mucin-like O-ringed
oligosaccharide-rich repeat domains flanked by cysteine-rich N- and
C-terminal domains that are homologous to the somatomedin B and
hemopexin domains of vitronectin (193190), respectively.

Schumacher et al.(1994) described superficial zone protein (SZP), an
approximately 345-kD proteoglycan specifically synthesized by
chondrocytes located at the surface of bovine articular cartilage, and
also by some synovial lining cells. They demonstrated that SZP is
secreted by superficial zone chondrocytes and not by chondrocytes from
other zones of articular cartilage. SZP contains both chondroitin
sulfate and keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. SZP is extensively
degraded by papain, trypsin (276000), and pronase, but limited pepsin
(see 169700) treatment decreases its molecular mass only to 315 kD. SZP
is predominantly found in the media of explant and cell cultures.

Flannery et al. (1999) used cDNA sequencing and homology analysis to
elucidate the complete amino acid composition for the superficial zone
protein from human and bovine cartilage. They established that human
cartilage SZP is homologous with the proteoglycan first described as the
precursor protein of a megakaryocyte-stimulating factor by Merberg et
al. (1993). The cDNA encodes a protein of 1,404 amino acids with a
somatomedin B homology domain, heparin-binding domains, multiple
mucin-like repeats, a hemopexin domain, and an aggregation domain. There
are 3 consensus sequences for N-glycosylation and 1 chondroitin sulfate
substitution site. Bovine SZP and human MSF precursor sequences are
about 75% identical at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels.

Using a positional cloning approach, Marcelino et al. (1999) identified
the MSF gene within the chromosome 1q25-q31 critical region for the
autosomal recessive camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis
syndrome (CACP; 208250) locus. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that
a 4.5-kb MSF mRNA is expressed in several tissues, including liver,
lung, and heart, and is highly expressed in synovial tissue. A 30-kD
N-terminal MSF fragment was detectable in serum and urine.

By Northern blot analysis, Ikegawa et al. (2000) demonstrated limited
expression of the human PRG4 gene as 4.2- and 1.7-kb transcripts;
expression was strongest in liver, but was also observed in heart,
brain, and muscle. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated strong expression in
cartilage. RT-PCR also detected 4 types of alternative splicing. Type A
consisted of exons 1-6, type B of exons 1 and 3-5, type C of exons 1-3,
and type D of exons 1 and 3. Resultant deletions caused by skipping
these exons were all in-frame. Types A and B were expressed
ubiquitously; types C and D showed tissue-limited expression.

The cells of hematopoietic and vascular endothelial cell lineages are
believed to share a common precursor, termed the hemangioblast. Liu et
al. (2004) reported the identification of hemangiopoietin (HAPO), a
novel growth factor acting on both hematopoietic and endothelial cell
lineages. The cDNA clone encoding HAPO is an alternative splicing
variant lacking exon 5 of PRG4, as demonstrated by a comparative cDNA
sequence analysis of HAPO and PRG4. Liu et al. (2004) suggested that
HAPO may have a clinical potential in the treatment of various
cytopenias and radiation injury and in the expansion of hematopoietic
and endothelial stem/progenitor cells.

Jay et al. (2000) purified lubricin from pooled synovial fluid with
normal lubricating activity that was obtained from patients with
osteoarthritis. Purified lubricin has an apparent molecular mass of 280
kD by SDS-PAGE; deglycosylation decreased the apparent molecular mass to
120 kD. Sequencing revealed a 100% match with exons 6 to 9 of the MSF
gene. Lubricin exhibited boundary-lubricating activity similar to that
of whole synovial fluid. Jay et al. (2000) concluded that lubricin is
secreted by synovial fibroblasts. They stated that lubricin is the only
lubricating component in the final lubricating fraction of human
synovial fluid.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ikegawa et al. (2000) determined that the human and mouse PRG4 genes
each contain 12 exons and that they span 18 and 16 kb, respectively.

MAPPING

Using a positional cloning approach, Marcelino et al. (1999) identified
the MSF gene within the chromosome 1q25-q31 critical region for the
autosomal recessive camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis
syndrome (CACP; 208250) locus.

By FISH, Ikegawa et al. (2000) mapped the human PRG4 gene to chromosome
1q24-q25. By the same method they mapped the mouse mouse Prg4 gene to
chromosome 1G, in a region showing syntenic homology to human 1q24-q25.

GENE FUNCTION

Jay et al. (2007) used a multiple-particle-tracking microrheology
technique to study the molecular interaction between lubricin and
hyaluronic acid in bovine synovial fluid. They found that lubricin
affects the diffusive behavior of synovial fluid and contributes to the
elastic absorption and energy dissipation of synovial fluid at
physiologic shear frequencies. In studies involving synovial fluid from
a patient with camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis,
hyaluronic acid molecules adopted an extended and more rigid
conformation, suggesting that synovial fluid lacking lubricin would be
less able to dissipate the energy of impact that occurs during mammalian
locomotion. Jay et al. (2007) concluded that lubricin provides a
chondroprotective feature to synovial fluid that is distinct from the
role lubricin plays at the cartilage surface as a boundary lubricant.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Marcelino et al. (1999) identified 8 likely disease-causing mutations in
the MSF gene in patients with CACP from consanguineous families. Four
were homozygous deletions. Additionally, they detected a dinucleotide
transversion that created a nonsense codon, and a 41-bp insertion 14
nucleotides upstream of the intron 6 splice acceptor site that disrupted
the polypyrimidine tract of the splice site. Each of these mutations was
predicted to result in a truncated protein. Due to its high
glycosylation content and mucin-like repeats, Marcelino et al. (1999)
suggested that MSF may act as a joint/intimal cell lubricant. Both
synovial and pericardial cell hyperplasia may represent secondary
consequences of insufficient cell surface lubrication. Alternatively,
cell overgrowth may be primary to the pathogenesis of CACP.

ANIMAL MODEL

Rhee et al. (2005) generated Prg4 -/- mice, in which joints appeared
normal at birth; with aging there were abnormal protein deposits on the
cartilage surface, disappearance of underlying superficial zone
chondrocytes, and hyperplasia of intimal cells in the synovium. Purified
or recombinant lubricin inhibited the growth of those synoviocytes in
vitro. Tendon and tendon sheath involvement was present in the ankle
joints, with morphologic changes and abnormal calcification. Rhee et al.
(2005) concluded that lubricin has multiple functions in articulating
joints and tendons that include the protection of surfaces and control
of synovial cell growth.

605725	TITLE *605725 PERIAXIN; PRX
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PRX gene encodes 2 isoforms, L- and S-periaxin, which are structural
proteins mainly expressed by myelinating Schwann cells in the peripheral
nervous system. Periaxin interacts with the dystroglycan complex (see,
e.g., DAG1, 128239) via DRP2 (300052), thus linking the basal lamina to
the Schwann cell cytoskeleton (summary by Marchesi et al., 2010).

GENE STRUCTURE

Boerkoel et al. (2001) determined that the PRX gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH and electronic PCR (Schuler, 1997), Boerkoel et al. (2001)
mapped the PRX gene between D19S324 and D19S223 within a BAC on
19q13.1-q13.2, a position showing conserved synteny with mouse
chromosome 7 where the Prx gene maps (Gillespie et al., 1997).

GENE FUNCTION

The periaxin gene (PRX) encodes 2 PDZ-domain proteins, L- and
S-periaxin, that are required for maintenance of peripheral nerve myelin
(Dytrych et al., 1998). The PDZ domain, which consists of a nearly
90-amino acid protein-binding motif that interacts with the C termini of
plasma membrane proteins and with the cortical cytoskeleton, has been
implicated in the assembly of signaling complexes at sites of cell-cell
contact (Boerkoel et al., 2001).

Boerkoel et al. (2001) pointed out that the interactions among
L-periaxin, the cytoskeleton, and a membrane complex are reminiscent of
the interactions among the proteins of the dystrophin-sarcoglycan
complex (Cohn and Campbell, 2000) and the signaling complexes organized
by other PDZ domain proteins. They hypothesized that mutations in
cytoskeletal and membrane proteins interacting with L-periaxin may also
cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (see 118200) or related neuropathies.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Dejerine-Sottas Neuropathy

In 3 unrelated patients with Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy (145900) mapping
to chromosome 19q13.1-q13.2, Boerkoel et al. (2001) identified recessive
mutations in the PRX gene (605725.0001-605725.004).

- Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, Type 4F

In affected members of a Lebanese family with Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease type 4F (CMT4F; 614895) reported by Delague et al. (2000),
Guilbot et al. (2001) identified a homozygous mutation in the PRX gene
(R196X; 605725.0005).

In 66 Japanese patients with demyelinating CMT in whom the causative
mutation had not been identified, Kijima et al. (2004) tested for
mutation in the PRX gene. Three unrelated patients were found to be
homozygous for an arg1070-to-ter mutation (R1070X; 605725.0008); they
presented with early onset and slowly progressive distal motor and
sensory neuropathy. Kijima et al. (2004) concluded that mutations
lacking the C-terminal acidic domain of PRX may show loss of function
effects and cause severe demyelinating CMT.

Marchesi et al. (2010) noted that all patients with neuropathy due to
PRX mutations had truncating mutations in homozygous or compound
heterozygous state, consistent with loss of protein function as a
disease mechanism.

Tokunaga et al. (2012) reported 3 unrelated Japanese patients with
adult-onset, slowly progressive CMT4F due to homozygous mutations in the
PRX gene (R1070X, 605725.0008 or D651N, 605725.0011). The report
expanded the phenotype associated with PRX mutations and identified the
first missense mutation in this gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Confirming the necessity of periaxin for maintenance of the myelin
sheath, Gillespie et al. (2000) demonstrated that Prx -/- mice ensheath
and myelinate peripheral axons apparently normally but subsequently
develop a severe demyelinating neuropathy associated with allodynia
(pain from non-noxious stimuli) and hyperalgesia (hypersensitivity to
pain). Sherman et al. (2001) found that L-periaxin interacted and
colocalized with dystrophin-related protein-2 (DRP2; 300052) within a
dystroglycan complex localized to the plasma membrane of Schwann cells.
In Prx-null mice, Sherman et al. (2001) found mislocalization and
concomitant loss of Drp2, suggesting that L-periaxin stabilizes the
Drp2-dystroglycan complex. Sherman et al. (2001) concluded that the
L-periaxin-Drp2-dystroglycan complex is important in regulating the
terminal stages of myelination.

Nerve impulses are propagated at nodes of Ranvier in the myelinated
nerves of vertebrates. Internodal distances have been proposed to affect
the velocity of nerve impulse conduction. Ramon y Cajal (1933) described
longitudinal and transverse bands of cytoplasm or trabeculae in
internodal Schwann cells and suggested that they had a nutritive
function. Court et al. (2004) showed that internodal growth in wildtype
nerves is precisely matched to nerve extension, but disruption of the
cytoplasmic bands in periaxin-null mice impairs Schwann cell elongation
during nerve growth. By contrast, myelination proceeds normally. The
capacity of wildtype and mutant Schwann cells to elongate is cell
autonomous, indicating that passive stretching can account for the
lengthening of the internode during limb growth. As predicted on
theoretical grounds, decreased internodal distances strikingly decrease
conduction velocities and so affect motor function. Court et al. (2004)
proposed that microtubule-based transport in the longitudinal bands of
Cajal permits internodal Schwann cells to lengthen in response to axonal
growth, thus ensuring rapid nerve impulse transmission.

In affected members of a family with autosomal recessive Dejerine-Sottas
neuropathy (145900), Boerkoel et al. (2001) found compound
heterozygosity in the periaxin gene for a 2857C-T transition resulting
in an arg953-to-ter (R953X) substitution and a 1-bp deletion (2787delC)
resulting in a frameshift that terminates the protein at codon 957
(605725.0003). Markedly reduced nerve-conduction velocities and
onion-bulb formation were demonstrated. The patients had a more severe

resulting in an arg196-to-ter nonsense mutation (R196X) which
cosegregated with the disorder. Histopathologic and immunohistochemical
analysis of a sural nerve biopsy of 1 patient revealed common features
with the mouse mutant and the absence of L-periaxin from the myelin
sheath. These data confirmed the importance of the periaxin proteins to
normal Schwann cell function.

CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 4F
PRX, CYS715TER

In a brother and sister, born of unrelated parents, with CMT4F (614895),
Takashima et al. (2002) identified a homozygous cys715-to-ter (C715X)
substitution in the PRX gene. Sensory involvement was present and was
much worse than motor impairment. Despite early onset of disease, these
sibs had relatively slow disease progression and adult motor impairment.

DEJERINE-SOTTAS NEUROPATHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
PRX, 1-BP DEL, 247C

In a patient with Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy (145900), the offspring of
consanguineous parents, Takashima et al. (2002) found homozygosity for
deletion of 1 bp (247delC) in the PRX gene, resulting in a frameshift
and a stop codon at residue 96 (R82fsX96).

.0008
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 4F
PRX, ARG1070TER

In 3 unrelated Japanese patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type
4F (614895), Kijima et al. (2004) identified a homozygous 3208C-T
transition in the PRX gene, resulting in an arg1070-to-ter (R1070X)
mutation. The patients presented with early onset and slowly progressive
distal motor and sensory neuropathy. All 3 patients were born of
healthy, consanguineous parents. Two of the patients also had an
affected sib. On sural nerve biopsy, 1 patient had atypical onion bulb
formation, the second had more typical onion bulb formation, and the
third had onion bulb and tomacula formation.

Otagiri et al. (2006) reported a Japanese girl with CMT4F who was
compound heterozygous for the R1070X mutation and a 10-bp insertion
(605725.0009) in the PRX gene. Each of her unaffected parents was
heterozygous for 1 of the mutations. Haplotype analysis of this family
and the 3 Japanese families reported by Kijima et al. (2004) suggested
that the common R1070X mutation was a result of a mutation hotspot, not
a founder effect.

Tokunaga et al. (2012) reported 2 unrelated Japanese patients with
adult-onset CMT4F due to a homozygous R1070X mutation. One patient
developed mild distal muscle wasting and sensory disturbance in all
limbs at age 50 years. The disorder was slowly progressive, and she
could still walk independently at age 63 despite having pes cavus. Sural
nerve biopsy showed moderate demyelination and complex onion bulb
formation. The other patient developed lower limb weakness at age 37
years. At age 47, he could walk with a walking vehicle. Other features
included scoliosis and areflexia. Sural nerve biopsy showed myelin
thinning and onion bulbs. Motor nerve conduction velocities in the
median nerve were 20 m/s in both patients. Tokunaga et al. (2012)
emphasized the late onset and relatively mild phenotype in these
patients.

CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 4F
PRX, 4-BP DEL, 1194TTCC

In a boy with CMT4F (614895), Kabzinska et al. (2006) identified a
homozygous 4-bp deletion (1194delTTCC) in the PRX gene, resulting in a
frameshift and premature termination of the protein at codon 410.
Immunohistochemical studies on sural nerve detected the protein's N
terminus, but not the C terminus, indicating that the protein was
truncated in vivo. Both unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation.

.0011
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, TYPE 4F, LATE-ONSET
PRX, ASP651ASN

In a Japanese woman with adult-onset CMT4F (614895), Tokunaga et al.
(2012) identified a homozygous mutation in the PRX gene, resulting in an
asp651-to-asn (D651N) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
repeat domain. The mutation was not found in 292 control chromosomes,
but was found in 1 of 2,188 exomes. Her 3 unaffected brothers were all
heterozygous for the mutation. Functional analysis of the variant was
not performed. The patient had delayed independent ambulation due to
nonspecific infantile paralysis at age 18 months. At age 30 years, she
developed mild distal muscle weakness and sensory impairment in the
lower limbs. Upper limb wasting was observed at age 44 years, and she
had vocal cord paralysis. Other features included pes cavus, scoliosis,
and areflexia. The disorder was slowly progressive. At age 65, she had
to use leg braces and a wheelchair. Nerve conduction velocities were not
recordable and sural nerve biopsy showed significant demyelination.

600549	TITLE *600549 IK CYTOKINE, DOWNREGULATOR OF HLA II; IK
;;CYTOKINE IK;;
IK FACTOR;;
RED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Major histocompatibility class II antigens participate in the antigen
presentation process and modulate the immune response (Radka et al.,
1986). Loss of HLA class II expression by certain cancers is responsible
for the mechanism of escape from immunorecognition. Antigen presentation
can be induced by interferon-gamma (147570) and certain cell types, such
as K562 cells, secrete factors which inhibit this process. Krief et al.
(1994) purified a 19-kD cytokine, designated IK factor, with such
inhibitory activity. Antibodies to the IK factor were produced and used
to screen an expression cDNA library of K562 cell mRNA. A cDNA was
isolated that recognized a 2.1-kb mRNA in a variety of cell types, and
transient transfection of COS cells produced the expected 19-kD protein.

Assier et al. (1999) determined that IK is part of a larger gene, which
they termed RED, encoding a 557-amino acid protein that is 98% identical
to the mouse sequence and contains an extensive stretch of arg-glu-asp
(RED) repeats. Notably, the codon usage in the RED repeat is varied,
suggesting the sequence is not a result of repetitive duplication. RE
repeats are found in atrophin-1 (607462), and RD repeats are found in RD
(154040). Northern and dot blot analyses revealed ubiquitous expression
of a 2.0-kb RED transcript in human and mouse tissue. Western blot
analysis showed that RED is expressed in both bacterial and mammalian
cells as an 80-kD protein. Sequence analysis predicted and
immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that RED is localized to
nuclear dots similar to the expression pattern of PML bodies (see SP100;
604585); however, RED does not colocalize with PML (102578) or coilin
(COIL; 600272) and appears to be sequestered from the nucleoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Cao et al. (1997) used semiquantitative RT-PCR to detect IK mRNA in CD34
(142230)-positive stem cells purified from cord blood. IK expression
increased with growth factor-induced cell differentiation, decreased
with IK antisense treatment, and was inversely correlated with
expression of HLA-DR as well as CD34. Colony-forming assays showed that
IK antisense treatment reduced the size and number of colonies
differentiating from CD34-positive stem cells, particularly by
multilineage early erythroid and granulomonocytic progenitor cells.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Krief et al. (1994) mapped the IK gene to
chromosome 2p15-p14. However, using radiation hybrid analysis, Assier et
al. (1999) determined that this localization is incorrect and mapped the
RED gene to chromosome 5q22-q23. Gross (2011) mapped the IK gene to
chromosome 5q31.3 based on an alignment of the IK sequence (GenBank
GENBANK BC013005) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

151750	TITLE *151750 LIPASE, HORMONE-SENSITIVE; LIPE
;;HSL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; EC 3.1.1.3) has a vital role in the
mobilization of free fatty acids from adipose tissue by controlling the
rate of lipolysis of the stored triglycerides. HSL regulates energy
homeostasis by catalyzing the rate-limiting step in adipose tissue
lipolysis. Like glycogen phosphorylase, the corresponding enzyme in
carbohydrate metabolism, HSL is under acute neuronal and hormonal
control. In both cases activation by catecholamines occurs through the
cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of a single serine residue. The
dephosphorylation of HSL by insulin is responsible for the antilipolytic
effect of this hormone, one of its most important actions (summary by
Holm et al., 1988).

CLONING

Holm et al. (1988) cloned the gene for hormone-sensitive lipase from the
rat adipocyte and found that the 757-amino acid sequence predicted by
the cDNA showed no homology with any other known lipase or protein. The
activity-controlling phosphorylation site was localized to serine-563 in
a markedly hydrophilic domain, and a lipid-binding consensus site was
tentatively identified.

Li et al. (1994) found that the Hsl mouse protein shares 94% sequence
identity with the previously determined rat sequence and 85% identity
with the human sequence. Despite the high degree of similarity, the 3
species diverge significantly for a stretch of 16 amino acid residues
upstream of the phosphorylation site.

Holst et al. (1996) cloned and expressed a testicular isoform of HSL
that has additional amino acids at the N terminus. As a result, rat and
human testicular isoforms consist of 1,068 and 1,076 amino acids,
respectively, compared to the 768 and 775 amino acids, respectively, of
the adipocyte isoform. Holst et al. (1996) isolated a novel exon of 1.2
kb encoding the human testis-specific amino acids and mapped it to the
HSL gene, 16 kb upstream of the exons encoding adipocyte HSL. A 3.3-kb
transcript was detected in mammary gland, adrenal gland, adipose tissue
and muscle, and both a 3.3- and 3.9-kb transcript were found in testis.
No significant similarity with other known proteins was found for the
testis-specific sequence. They used immunocytochemistry to localize HSL
to elongated spermatids and spermatozoa; HSL was not detected in
interstitial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Because hormone-sensitive lipase is a key enzyme in overall energy
homeostasis, Holm et al. (1988) suggested that variations in its
expression or structure might be related to the development of obesity
as well as to lipodystrophy syndromes (e.g., 151660) and lipomatosis
(151800). Lipomatosis is characterized by formation of lipomas that are
defective in adrenergic-stimulated lipolysis.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of DNA from human-rodent somatic cell hybrids, Holm
et al. (1988) mapped the human LIPE gene to chromosome 19cen-q13.3. By
hybridization studies using a panel of somatic cell hybrids with
subchromosomal segments of 19q, Schonk et al. (1990) localized the LIPE
gene to 19q13.1. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Levitt et al.
(1995) mapped the gene to 19q13.1-q13.2.

Wang et al. (1994) demonstrated that the mouse Lipe gene is on proximal
chromosome 7. They found that mouse Lipe gene is distinct from the Tub
and Ad loci, which are associated with obesity in the mouse.

ANIMAL MODEL

HSL is known to mediate the hydrolysis not only of triacylglycerol
stored in adipose tissue but also of cholesterol esters in the adrenals,
ovaries, testes, and macrophages. To elucidate its precise role in the
development of obesity and steroidogenesis, Osuga et al. (2000)
generated HSL knockout mice by homologous recombination in embryonic
stem cells. Mice homozygous for the mutant allele were superficially
normal except that the males were sterile due to oligospermia. The
homozygous null mice did not have hypogonadism or adrenal insufficiency.
Instead, the testes completely lacked neutral cholesterol ester
hydrolase (NCEH) activities and contained increased amounts of
cholesterol ester. Many epithelial cells in the seminiferous tubules
were vacuolated. NCEH activities were completely absent from both brown
adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) in homozygous null
mice. Consistently, adipocytes were significantly enlarged in the BAT
(5-fold) and, to a lesser extent, in the WAT (2-fold), supporting the
concept that the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol was, at least in part,
impaired in homozygous null mice. The BAT mass was increased by
1.65-fold, but the WAT mass remained unchanged. Discrepancy of the size
differences between cell and tissue suggested the heterogeneity of
adipocytes. Despite these morphologic changes, homozygous null mice were
neither obese nor cold sensitive. Furthermore, WAT from homozygous null
mice retained 40% of triacylglycerol lipase activities compared with
wildtype WAT. Osuga et al. (2000) concluded that HSL is required for
spermatogenesis but is not the only enzyme that mediates the hydrolysis
of triacylglycerol stored in adipocytes.

Das et al. (2011) showed that inhibition of lipolysis through genetic
ablation of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL; 609059) or Hsl
ameliorates certain features of cancer-associated cachexia. In wildtype
C57BL/6 mice, the injection of Lewis lung carcinoma or B16 melanoma
cells causes tumor growth, loss of white adipose tissue, and a marked
reduction of gastrocnemius muscle. In contrast, Atgl-deficient mice with
tumors resisted increased white adipose tissue lipolysis, myocyte
apoptosis, and proteasomal muscle degradation and maintained normal
adipose and gastrocnemius muscle mass. Hsl-deficient mice with tumors
were also protected, although to a lesser degree. Das et al. (2011)
concluded that functional lipolysis is essential in the pathogenesis of
cancer-associated cachexia.

placenta cDNA library, Hirst et al. (2011) cloned DKFZp761E198, or
beta-5. The deduced 878-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 94 kD. DKFZp761E198 contains a long N-terminal alpha-helical
solenoid, followed by an unstructured flexible linker and a putative
C-terminal appendage domain. DKFZp761E198 shares significant similarity
with beta-adaptin (see AP1B1; 600157) and beta-COP (COPB; 600959).
Database analysis detected DKFZp761E198 orthologs in at least 2
representatives from each of the 5 major eukaryotic supergroups, but not
in S. cerevisiae.

GENE FUNCTION

By Western blot analysis of HeLa cell lysates, Hirst et al. (2011) found
that knockdown of DKFZp761E198 via small interfering RNA reduced
expression of C14ORF108. Knockdown of either DKFZp761E198 or C14ORF108
caused relocalization of the lysosomal membrane protein CIMPR (IGF2R;
147280) and the retromere protein VPS26 (605506) from fine puncta to
large perinuclear puncta. Hirst et al. (2011) hypothesized that
DKFZp761E198 functions as a large beta subunit in a novel adaptor
protein complex, AP5, with a role in endocytosis. AP complexes normally
contain a second large subunit, a medium-sized mu subunit, and a small
sigma subunit. Hirst et al. (2011) found that C14ORF108 had
characteristics of an AP5 mu subunit. Therefore, they proposed that
DKFZp761E198 and C14ORF108 be renamed beta-5 and mu-5, respectively.
Hirst et al. (2011) noted that Slabicki et al. (2010) immunoprecipitated
DKFZp761E198 and C14ORF108 with KIAA0415 (613653) and C20ORF29 (AP5S1;
614824) and proposed that KIAA0415 and C20ORF29 may function as the
second large subunit (zeta) and the sigma-5 subunit of AP5,
respectively.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the DKFZp761E198 gene to chromosome 11q13.1 based on
an alignment of the DKFZp761E198 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF193040)
with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;UBC4/5, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF;;
UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME UBCH5C; UBCH5C
DESCRIPTION See UBE2D1 (602961) for general information about ubiquitination and the
UBC4/5 subfamily of E2 enzymes.

CLONING

By PCR using oligonucleotides based on UBCH5B (UBE2D2; 602962), Jensen
et al. (1995) identified a human peripheral blood lymphocyte cDNA
encoding UBCH5C, or UBE2D3. The predicted 147-amino acid UBCH5C and
UBCH5B proteins differ by only 4 amino acids, with 3 of the differences
conservative changes; the nucleotide sequences of their cDNAs are 87%
identical within the coding region and 23% conserved within the 3-prime
untranslated region. The UBCH5C protein has 94% sequence identity with
the Drosophila UbcD1 protein, 92% identity with C. elegans ubc2, 88%
identity with human UBCH5A (UBE2D1), and 79% identity with S. cerevisiae
UBC4 and UBC5, and Arabidopsis thaliana UBC8 and UBC9. Recombinant
UBCH5C expressed in E. coli had a molecular mass of 16 kD by SDS-PAGE.
Quantitative PCR showed that UBCH5C was expressed in all human tissues
examined and at higher levels than UBCH5A and UBCH5B.

GENE FUNCTION

Jensen et al. (1995) demonstrated that UBCH5C could conjugate ubiquitin
to target proteins in an E6AP (UBE3A; 601623)-dependent manner.

All-trans retinoic acid (RA) is used in differentiation therapy to
achieve remission of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) because it
causes APL cell cycle arrest and differentiation. Using a short hairpin
RNA screen, Hattori et al. (2007) identified UBE2D3 among 26 proteins
that were essential for RA-induced differentiation and growth arrest in
NB4 human promyelocytic cells. UBE2D3 was upregulated following RA
treatment of NB4 cells. UBE2D3 physically associated with cyclin D1
(CCND1; 168461) and mediated RA-induced cyclin D1 degradation. Knockdown
of UBE2D3 by RNA interference blocked RA-induced cyclin D1 degradation
and cell cycle arrest. Hattori et al. (2007) concluded that
ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is involved in RA-induced cell cycle
arrest.

Shembade et al. (2010) showed that A20 (191163) inhibits the E3 ligase
activities of TRAF6 (602355), TRAF2 (601895), and cIAP1 (601712) by
antagonizing interactions with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBC13
(603679) and UBCH5C. A20, together with the regulatory molecule TAX1BP1
(605326), interacted with UBC13 and UBCH5C and triggered their
ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. These findings
suggested a mechanism of A20 action in the inhibition of inflammatory
signaling pathways.

Okiyoneda et al. (2010) identified the components of the peripheral
protein quality control network that removes unfolded CFTR containing
the F508del mutation (602421.0001) from the plasma membrane. Based on
their results and proteostatic mechanisms at different subcellular
locations, Okiyoneda et al. (2010) proposed a model in which the
recognition of unfolded cytoplasmic regions of CFTR is mediated by HSC70
(600816) in concert with DNAJA1 (602837) and possibly by the HSP90
machinery (140571). Prolonged interaction with the chaperone-cochaperone
complex recruits CHIP (607207)-UBCH5C and leads to ubiquitination of
conformationally damaged CFTR. This ubiquitination is probably
influenced by other E3 ligases and deubiquitinating enzyme activities,
culminating in accelerated endocytosis and lysosomal delivery mediated
by Ub-binding clathrin adaptors and the endosomal sorting complex
required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, respectively. In an
accompanying perspective, Hutt and Balch (2010) commented that the
'yin-yang' balance maintained by the proteostasis network is critical
for normal cellular, tissue, and organismal physiology.

605065	TITLE *605065 CELL DIVISION CYCLE 37, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; CDC37
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cyclin-dependent kinase-4 (CDK4; 123829) is a cyclin D-dependent kinase
that controls progression through G1 phase of the mammalian cell cycle.
To identify proteins involved in CDK4 regulation, Dai et al. (1996)
analyzed CDK4 complexes from various cells by immunoprecipitation. Two
proteins coimmunoprecipitated with CDK4, one with a molecular mass of 85
kD, which was found to be HSP90 (see 140571), and the other with a
molecular mass of 44 kD. Dai et al. (1996) identified the second protein
as the human homolog of yeast CDC37. Human CDC37 contains 378 amino
acids and shares 45% and 25% amino acid identity with Drosophila and S.
cerevisiae CDC37, respectively. Mutations in yeast CDC37 cause cell
cycle arrest in G1 phase, and yeast CDC37 is required for the
association of CDC28 and cyclin and for the activation of CDC28 (Reed,
1980).

Stepanova et al. (1996) independently cloned and characterized human and
mouse CDC37 by using sequences from partial cdc37-like chicken cDNA to
amplify and screen various human and mouse cDNA libraries. The
intracellular distribution of CDC37 was largely cytoplasmic, and the
protein appeared to colocalize with cytoplasmic HSP90. CDC37 was
expressed in the same tissues during development as D-type cyclins, such
as proliferating zones of small intestine and stomach.

GENE FUNCTION

In in vitro assays, Stepanova et al. (1996) showed that CDC37 associated
most efficiently with CDK4, less with CDK6 (603368) and CDK7 (601955),
but not with CDK2 or CDK3. They determined that CDC37, CDK4, and HSP90
form a high molecular weight complex. The interactions between CDK4 and
CDC37 and those between CDK4 and D-type cyclins were found to be
mutually exclusive. Loss of association of CDC37 and CDK4 by
pharmacologic disruption of HSP90 function led to reduced stability of
newly synthesized CDK4. Stepanova et al. (1996) concluded that CDC37 and
HSP90 are important for CDK4 stability and play a positive role in cell
cycle progression.

Chen et al. (2002) identified CDC37 and HSP90 as 2 additional components
of the I-kappa-B kinase (IKK) complex. This complex also contains 2
catalytic subunits, IKK-alpha (600664) and IKK-beta (603258), and a
regulatory subunit, NEMO (300248).

Vaughan et al. (2008) stated that CDC37 is phosphorylated on ser13,
probably by casein kinase II (see 115440), and that absence of this
phosphorylation severely compromises CDC37 function. They showed that
ser13 was phosphorylated in vivo in uncomplexed CDC37, in CDC37 in a
binary complex with CDK4, and in CDC37 in a ternary complex with CDK4
and HSP90. Ser13 in the CDC37-CDK4-HSP90 complex was resistant to
nonspecific phosphatases, but it was efficiently dephosphorylated by
protein phosphatase-5 (PP5, or PPP5C; 600658), which did not
dephosphorylate uncomplexed CDC37. CDC37 and PP5 associated in HSP90
complexes in yeast and in human tumor cells, and PP5 regulated
phosphorylation of ser13 of CDC37 in vivo, directly affecting activation
of protein kinases by CDC37-HSP90. Vaughan et al. (2008) proposed that a
cyclic regulatory mechanism reverses constitutive CDC37 phosphorylation
when CDC37 is engaged in HSP90 complexes.

;;VERTEBRATE LIN7 HOMOLOG 2; VELI2;;
MAMMALIAN LIN7 HOMOLOG 2; MALS2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching EST databases for homologs of C. elegans Lin7, Butz et al.
(1998) identified murine Lin7b, which they called Veli2. The deduced
207-amino acid Veli2 protein has a C-terminal PDZ domain. Western blot
analysis detected Veli2 in all rat tissues examined, with highest
expression in brain.

By Northern blot analysis, Jo et al. (1999) found that rat Lin7b, which
they called Mals2, was expressed specifically in brain. Sucrose gradient
centrifugation showed enrichment of Mals proteins in rat cerebral cortex
synaptosomes. Mals2 had an apparent molecular mass of 25 kD by Western
blot analysis.

By immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization using antibodies and
cRNAs specific for mouse Mals1 (LIN7A; 603380), Mals2, and Mals3 (LIN7C;
612332), Misawa et al. (2001) showed that each Mals protein localized to
distinct brain regions. The Mals proteins were predominantly expressed
in both neuronal cell bodies and neuropil, and they were not detected in
most nonneuronal cells in brain.

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Sudo et al. (2006) found that Lin7
proteins colocalized with a tight junction marker at cell-cell contacts
in canine kidney cells, in perinuclear and marginal regions and with
stress fibers in rat fibroblasts, and throughout the cytoplasm and
enriched at the neurite tip in a mouse neuroblastoma cell line.

GENE FUNCTION

Butz et al. (1998) identified a complex of 3 proteins in rat brain that
had the potential to couple synaptic vesicle exocytosis to neuronal cell
adhesion. The 3 proteins were Cask (300172), a protein related to
membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs); Mint1 (APBA1; 602414), a
putative vesicular trafficking protein; and the Velis. Cask, Mint1, and
the Velis formed a tight, salt-resistant complex. Butz et al. (1998)
determined that the N-terminal domains of Cask, Mint1, and the Velis
were involved in complex formation, leaving their C-terminal PDZ domains
free to recruit adhesion molecules, receptors, and channels to the
complex. Butz et al. (1998) proposed that the tripartite complex acts as
a nucleation site for the assembly of proteins involved in synaptic
vesicle exocytosis and synaptic junctions.

Jo et al. (1999) found that rat Mals proteins immunoprecipitated with
Psd95 (DLG4; 602887) and NMDA receptor-2B (NR2B, or GRIN2B; 138252) from
solubilized rat cerebral cortex membranes. Protein pull-down assays
confirmed the interaction between Mals2, Psd95, and Nr2b and showed that
the C-terminal 9 amino acids of Nr2b interacted with the PDZ domain of
Mals2. Screening C-terminal peptide sequences revealed that the PDZ
domain of MALS2 showed highest affinity for the consensus sequence
E(T/S)(R/X)(V/L/I/F), which matches the C terminus of Nr2b.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human brain cDNA library, Sudo et al.
(2006) found that the C terminus of rhotekin (RTKN; 602288) interacted
with LIN7B. They confirmed the interaction by protein pull-down assays
using recombinant proteins and immunoprecipitation analysis of
cotransfected COS-7 cells. A constitutively active version of RHOA
(165390), but not activated RAC (602048) or CDC42 (116952), increased
the affinity between rhotekin and LIN7B. Lin7 and rhotekin also
coimmunoprecipitated from rat brain lysates. Sudo et al. (2006)
concluded that LIN7 has a role in neuronal RHO/rhotekin signaling.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the LIN7B gene to chromosome 19q13.33 based on an
alignment of the LIN7B sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF311862) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

ANIMAL MODEL

Misawa et al. (2001) obtained Mals1 -/-, Mals2 -/-, and Mals1 -/- Mals2
-/- double-knockout mice at expected mendelian frequencies, and all
mutant strains were viable, fertile, and indistinguishable from their
wildtype littermates. Electrophysiologic analysis showed normal
excitatory synaptic activity in the hippocampal CA1 region of
double-knockout animals. However, double-knockout animals showed
upregulation of Mals3 in most, but not all, brain regions, suggesting
that upregulation of Mals3 may compensate for loss of Mals1 and Mals2
expression.

114780	TITLE *114780 CARBONIC ANHYDRASE VI; CA6
;;CA VI;;
CARBONIC ANHYDRASE, SECRETED;;
GUSTIN
DESCRIPTION Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are a family of zinc metalloenzymes. For
background information on the CA family, see 114800.

CA VI is a 42-kD secreted isozyme found in salivary glands and saliva
(Murakami and Sly, 1987). By using biochemical and immunohistochemical
techniques, Karhumaa et al. (2001) demonstrated that CA VI is also an
elementary component of milk.

Aldred et al. (1991) isolated and sequenced cDNA clones coding for CA6.
The clones identified a 1.45-kb mRNA that was present in high levels in
parotid submandibular salivary glands but absent in other tissues such
as sublingual gland, kidney, liver, and prostate. The cDNA encoded a
protein of 308 amino acids that included a 17-amino acid leader sequence
typical of secreted proteins. The mature CA VI protein has 291 amino
acids, compared to the 259 or 260 residues of the cytoplasmic isozymes;
most of the extra amino acids present are in the carboxyl terminal
region. CA VI has diverged significantly in its structure from the
cytoplasmic isozymes, including CA I (114800), CA II (611492), and CA
III (114750), which are closely related to one another. The CA VI
protein has 35% sequence identity with human CA II, while residues
involved in the active site of the enzymes have been conserved. Southern
analysis of human DNA indicated that there is only 1 gene coding for CA
VI.

Thatcher et al. (1998) identified gustin as CA6. Gustin contains 2
potential N-linked glycosylation sites. By RP-HPLC and SDS-PAGE, gustin
purified from human saliva had a molecular mass of 37 kD before
deglycosylation and 33 kD after.

Karhumaa et al. (2001) showed that the 42-kD CA VI glycopolypeptide
purified from human milk shares 100% homology with salivary CA VI in
protein sequence. They found that its concentration is approximately 8
times higher in human colostrum than in mature milk, the latter
corresponding to the levels previously detected in human saliva. The
high concentration in colostrum, in particular its functional and
structural stability in an acidic milieu, and its growth-supporting role
in the taste buds suggest that milk CA VI is an essential factor in
normal growth and development of the infant alimentary tract.

By means of Southern analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and by in
situ hybridization, Sutherland et al. (1989) mapped the CA6 gene to
1p36.33-p36.22. White et al. (1998) reported physical mapping of the
CA6, ENO1 (172430), and SLC2A5 (138230) genes to 1p36 by study of yeast-
and P1-artificial chromosome (YAC and PAC) contigs. PACs from the contig
were mapped to 1p36.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

312173	TITLE *312173 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L10; RPL10
;;QM GENE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ribosomal protein L10 (RPL10) is a highly conserved component of the
large ribosome subunit (60S) that plays a crucial role in protein
synthesis (summary by Gong et al., 2009).

CLONING

In an attempt to isolate a suppressor gene in Wilms tumor (see 194070),
Dowdy et al. (1991) performed a subtractive hybridization assay with a
tumorigenic Wilms tumor cell line and its nontumorigenic derivative,
which contained an extra t(X;11) translocation chromosome. A single
novel cDNA clone, designated QM, was identified. The QM mRNA was
modulated between tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cell lines, making QM
gene an attractive tumor suppressor candidate gene.

In the course of investigating disease genes in the Xqter region, van
den Ouweland et al. (1992) found a cosmid that appeared to harbor the QM
gene, as it demonstrated 100% identity with the cDNA sequence published
by Dowdy et al. (1991).

As an essential step toward an exhaustive analysis of the coding
potential of a large region of the genome, Korn et al. (1992) developed
a protocol allowing the rapid isolation of transcripts defined by
overlapping clone libraries. The technique was applied to the analysis
of transcripts from 2 cosmid contigs, which together encompassed a
region of 900 kb in Xq28. They identified 81 cDNA clones, of which 54
clones were mapped back to the cosmid contigs. Of the 54 clones placed
on the contig maps, 12 cDNA clones were shown to belong to 2 genes that
had previously been reported, L1CAM (308840) and QM.

In the process of characterizing cosmid clones from the Xq28 region,
Kaneko et al. (1992) identified a sequence conserved across species in a
particular clone. Using the conserved sequence as a probe, they isolated
cDNA clones and demonstrated that the nucleotide sequence was the same
as that of the QM cDNA. Dowdy et al. (1991) had demonstrated that the QM
cDNA encodes a predicted hydrophilic 25-kD basic protein primarily
consisting of alpha helices. Southern blot analysis of a somatic cell
hybrid panel suggested that the QM gene belongs to a multigene family
with other representatives on chromosomes 2, 3, 6, 14, 16, and possibly
other chromosomes. Northern blot analysis detected QM expression in all
adult tissues examined, as well as in cell lines, including HeLa cells,
fibroblasts, and somatic cell hybrids, with increased expression in
liver, spleen, testis, and adrenal gland.

QM is a 214-amino acid polypeptide encoded by a gene previously
designated DXS648. It contains a high percentage of charged amino acids
and binds to the JUN oncogene (165160) and to DNA. Although they found
no matches between QM and any other known transcription factors in
searches of DNA databases, Farmer et al. (1994) found a high degree of
conservation throughout the first 175 residues of the protein when
studies were performed on a diverse array of eukaryotes. Most notable
was the considerable conservation of charged amino acids within specific
regions. The rate of sequence divergence of the various homologs was
found to be slow, of the order of 1% change every 22 million years,
consistent with a critical role of QM in eukaryotic cells. Farmer et al.
(1994) suggested that QM belongs to a novel class of transcription
regulatory proteins.

Oh et al. (2002) determined that the 213-amino acid QM protein contains
4 alpha helices, 2 PKC (see 176960) phosphorylation sites, 2
N-myristoylation sites, and 2 amidation sites. QM colocalized with YES1
(164880) in the cytoplasm of several tumor cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay of a HeLa cell library, Oh et al. (2002)
showed that QM interacted with YES1. Immunoprecipitation analysis and
protein pull-down assays showed that QM interacted with the SRC (190090)
homology-3 (SH3) domain of YES1. QM also interacted with other SRC
family members, including SRC, FYN (137025), HCK (142370), and LYN
(165120). Mutation analysis revealed 2 regions within QM that were
required for YES1 binding, and neither region contained a canonical
SH3-binding motif. Full-length QM suppressed the kinase activity of YES1
by suppressing its autophosphorylation activity. This inhibitory
activity was due predominantly to the C-terminal domain of QM, with
smaller contributions by the 2 SH3-binding regions. QM was not a YES
substrate. Overexpression of QM resulted in increased YES1 mRNA and
protein expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kaneko et al. (1992) demonstrated that the QM gene contains at least 7
exons.

MAPPING

Using exon-specific PCR, van den Ouweland et al. (1992) demonstrated
that the QM gene maps to chromosome Xq28 in the region of the G6PD
(305900) and color vision genes (e.g., OPN1LW; 300822).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Klauck et al. (2006) identified 2 missense mutations (L206M, 312173.0001
and H213Q, 312173.0002) in conserved residues at the end of exon 7 of
the RPL10 gene in patients with autism (AUTSX5; 300847). Chiocchetti et
al. (2011) identified an additional family with the H213Q mutation.

- Somatic Mutation in T-cell ALL

De Keersmaecker et al. (2013) identified mutations affecting the
ribosomal proteins RPL5 (603634) and RPL10 (312173) in 12 of 122 (9.8%)
pediatric T-ALLs, with recurrent alterations in RPL10 of arg98, an
invariant residue from yeast to human. Yeast and lymphoid cells
expressing the RPL10 arg98 to ser mutant showed a ribosome biogenesis
defect.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AUTISM, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, X-LINKED 5
RPL10, LEU206MET

In autistic dizygotic male twins from a German family (AUTSX5; 300847),
Klauck et al. (2006) identified a C-to-A transversion at nucleotide 616
in exon 7 of the RPL10 gene, resulting in a leu-to-met substitution at
codon 206 (L206M). This mutation was found in heterozygosity in the
mother. Leucine at position 206 is conserved through yeast, but an
isoleucine occurs at this codon in Drosophila. The mutation was not
identified in 408 control chromosomes.

.0002
AUTISM, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, X-LINKED 5
RPL10, HIS213GLN

In a German family with 2 brothers affected with autism (AUTSX5;
300847), Klauck et al. (2006) identified a C-to-G transversion at
nucleotide 693 in exon 7 of the RPL10 gene, resulting in a his-to-glu
substitution at codon 213 (H213Q). This mutation was found in both
affected sons, was not identified in the unaffected son or father, and
was identified in heterozygosity in the mother. Histine-213 is conserved
through all vertebrate species tested, including mouse, chicken,
Xenopus, and zebrafish. The mutation was not identified in 408 control
chromosomes.

Chiocchetti et al. (2011) identified another occurrence of this mutation
in an autistic male from a German family. The mother, older sister, and
maternal grandmother all carried the mutation. This family did not
appear to be related to the family reported by Klauck et al. (2006).
Chiocchetti et al. (2011) found normal RPL10 expression in probands with
H213Q mutant alleles, non-RPL10 mutated autism patients, and healthy
controls.

600849	TITLE *600849 NUCLEAR RECEPTOR COREPRESSOR 1; NCOR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Thyroid hormone receptor (THR1; 190160) and retinoic acid receptor
(RARA, 180240; RARB, 180220; RARG, 180190) exert their regulatory
functions by acting as both activators and repressors of gene
expression. Horlein et al. (1995) identified a mouse cDNA for a nuclear
receptor corepressor (Ncor) of relative molecular mass 270,000 that
mediates ligand-independent inhibition of gene transcription by Thr1 and
Rars. Their finding suggested that the molecular mechanisms of
repression by thyroid hormone and retinoic acid receptors are analogous
to the corepressor-dependent transcriptional inhibitory mechanisms of
yeast and Drosophila. They suggested that the corepressor is a member of
a new gene family, which they termed TRAC (thyroid hormone- and retinoic
acid receptor-associated corepressor).

GENE FUNCTION

Grignani et al. (1998) demonstrated that both PML-RAR-alpha (see 102578)
and PLZF-RAR-alpha (see 176797) fusion proteins recruit the NCOR-histone
deacetylase (see 601241) complex through the RAR-alpha CoR box.
PLZF-RAR-alpha contains a second, retinoic acid-resistant binding site
in the PLZF amino-terminal region. High doses of retinoic acid release
histone deacetylase activity from PML-RAR-alpha, but not from
PLZF-RAR-alpha. Mutation of the NCOR binding site abolishes the ability
of PML-RAR-alpha to block differentiation, whereas inhibition of histone
deacetylase activity switches the transcriptional and biologic effects
of PLZF-RAR-alpha from being an inhibitor to an activator of the
retinoic acid signaling pathway. Therefore, Grignani et al. (1998)
concluded that recruitment of histone deacetylase is crucial to the
transforming potential of APL fusion proteins, and the different effects
of retinoic acid on the stability of the PML-RAR-alpha and
PLZF-RAR-alpha corepressor complexes determines the differential
response of APLs to retinoic acid.

Binding of ligand to nuclear hormone receptors induces a conformation
that attracts coactivator proteins containing a Leu-x-x-Leu-Leu motif,
the so-called NR box. Hu and Lazar (1999) showed that NCOR1 and SMRT
(600848) contain sequences that are similar to the NR box and are
repeated in each of 2 nuclear hormone receptor interaction domains. Hu
and Lazar (1999) called this box (L/I-x-x-I/V-I) the 'corner box,' or
CoRNR box (for 'corepressor/nuclear receptor box'). The CoRNR box is
required for nuclear hormone receptor interaction, and the CoRNR box
peptides specifically block corepressor interaction in vitro and
repression in vivo. Sequences flanking the CoRNR box determine nuclear
hormone receptor specificity. Thus, Hu and Lazar (1999) concluded that
the key feature of hormone action, differential recognition of
unliganded and liganded nuclear hormone receptors by coactivators and
corepressors, is due to very subtle differences between CoRNR and NR
boxes.

Baek et al. (2002) demonstrated that interleukin-1-beta (IL1B; 147720)
causes nuclear export of a specific NCOR corepressor complex, resulting
in derepression of a specific subset of nuclear factor-kappa-B (NFKB;
see 164011)-regulated genes. These genes are exemplified by the
tetraspanin KAI1 (600623), which regulates membrane receptor function.
Nuclear export of the NCOR/TAB2 (605101)/HDAC3 (605166) complex by IL1B
is temporally linked to selective recruitment of a TIP60 (601409)
coactivator complex. KAI1 is also directly activated by a ternary
complex, dependent on the acetyltransferase activity of TIP60, that
consists of the presenilin-dependent C-terminal cleavage product of the
beta amyloid precursor protein (APP; 104760), FE65 (602709), and TIP60,
identifying a specific in vivo gene target of an APP-dependent
transcription complex in the brain.

Zhang et al. (2002) reported that GPS2 (601935), a protein involved in
intracellular signaling, is an integral subunit of the NCOR1 NCOR1-HDAC3
complex. They determined structural motifs that direct the formation of
a highly stable and active deacetylase complex. GPS2 and TBL1 (300196),
another component of the NCOR1-HDAC3 complex, interact cooperatively
with repression domain-1 of NCOR1 to form a heterotrimeric structure and
are indirectly linked to HDAC3 via an extended NCOR1 SANT domain that
also activates latent HDAC3 activity. Zhang et al. (2002) also showed
that the NCOR1-HDAC3 complex inhibits JNK (601158) activation through
the associated GPS2 subunit and thus could potentially provide an
alternative mechanism for hormone-mediated antagonism of AP1 (165160)
function.

Yoon et al. (2003) purified NCOR complexes, which contained 10 to 12
proteins, from HeLa cell nuclear extracts and characterized the
interactions of TBL1 and TBLR1 (608628) with NCOR. TBL1 and TBLR1
interacted with NCOR through 2 independent interactions. Their
N-terminal regions interacted with the RD1 region of NCOR, and their
C-terminal WD40 repeats interacted with the RD4 region of NCOR. In
vitro, TBL1 and TBLR1 also bound histones H2B (see 609904) and H4 (see
602822), and transcriptional repression by TBL1 and TBLR1 correlated
with their interactions with histones. Using small interfering RNAs,
Yoon et al. (2003) demonstrated that HDAC3 was essential for repression
by unliganded thyroid hormone receptor. TBL1 and TBLR1 were also
essential, but they were functionally redundant.

Virtually all neural stem cells maintain an undifferentiated state and
the capacity to self-renew in response to fibroblast growth factor-2
(FGF2; 134920). Hermanson et al. (2002) reported that NCOR, a repressor
or transcription, is a principal regulator in neural stem cells, since
FGF2-treated embryonic cortical progenitors from NCOR gene-disrupted
mice displayed impaired self-renewal and spontaneous differentiation
into astroglia-like cells. Stimulation of wildtype neural stem cells
with ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF; 118945), a
differentiation-inducing cytokine, resulted in a
phosphatidyl-inositol-3-OH kinase/Akt1 kinase-dependent (see 164730)
phosphorylation of NCOR, and caused a temporally correlated
redistribution of NCOR to the cytoplasm. Hermanson et al. (2002)
observed that this is a critical strategy for cytokine-induced astroglia
differentiation and lineage-characteristic gene expression. Recruitment
of protein phosphatase-1 (see 176875) to a specific binding site on NCOR
exerted a reciprocal effect on the cellular localization of NCOR.
Hermanson et al. (2002) proposed that repression by NCOR, modulated by
opposing enzymatic activities, is a critical mechanism in neural stem
cells that underlies the inhibition of glial differentiation.

Using transfected mouse and human cells, Sardi et al. (2006) found that,
upon NRG1 (142445)-induced activation and presenilin (PSEN1;
104311)-dependent cleavage of ERBB4 (600543), the ERBB4 intracellular
domain formed a complex with TAB2 and NCOR. This complex translocated to
the nucleus of undifferentiated rat neural precursors and inhibited
their differentiation into astrocytes by repressing transcription of
glial genes. Consistent with this observation, cortical astrogenesis
occurred precociously in Erbb4-knockout mice, and this phenotype could
be rescued by reexpression of a cleavable isoform of human ERBB4, but
not by reexpression of an uncleavable ERBB4 isoform.

MAPPING

Using a mapped bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing 158 kb
of genomic NCOR1, Ordentlich et al. (1999) mapped the human NCOR1 gene
to chromosome 11p11.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Jepsen et al. (2000) generated mice with targeted disruption of the
Ncor1 gene. Altered patterns of transcription in tissues and cells
derived from Ncor1-deficient mice and the resulting block at specific
points in central nervous system, erythrocyte, and thymocyte development
indicated that NCOR1 is a required component of short-term active
repression by nuclear receptors and MAD (600021) and of a subset of
long-term repression events mediated by REST (600571). Unexpectedly,
NCOR1 and HDAC3 were also required for transcriptional activation of 1
class of retinoic acid response element. Together, these findings
suggested that specific combinations of corepressors and histone
deacetylases mediate the gene-specific actions of DNA-bound repressors
in development of multiple organ systems.

Alenghat et al. (2008) created a knockin mouse model in which a missense
mutation, Y478A, was introduced into the Ncor1 deacetylase activation
domain (DAD). This created a mutant protein that was stable but unable
to associate with or activate Hdac3. The DADm mice were viable, born at
normal mendelian frequencies, and morphologically indistinguishable from
wildtype littermates at birth. Thus, Ncor1 binding to Hdac3 is not
required for normal development, and the embryonic defects of mice
lacking Ncor1 are due to factors other than, or in addition to, Hdac3
recruitment by Ncor1. However, the DADm mice had aberrant regulation of
clock genes and had abnormal circadian behavior. These mice were leaner
and more insulin-sensitive owing to increased energy expenditure.
Unexpectedly, loss of a functional Ncor1-Hdac3 complex in vivo did not
lead to sustained increases in known catabolic genes, but instead
significantly altered the oscillatory patterns of several metabolic
genes, demonstrating that circadian regulation of metabolism is critical
for normal energy balance. Alenghat et al. (2008) concluded that
activation of Hdac3 by Ncor1 is a nodal point in the epigenetic
regulation of circadian and metabolic physiology.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The SLC20A2 gene encodes an inorganic phosphate transporter that belongs
to the type III sodium-dependent phosphate transporter family (see
SLC20A1, 137570). These genes show broad expression in a variety of
tissues and likely play a housekeeping role in cellular phosphate uptake
(summary by Wang et al., 2012).

CLONING

The host range of retroviruses is determined primarily by the presence
of specific receptors on target cells which are recognized by the
retroviral envelope glycoprotein. Kaelbling et al. (1991) described a
receptor for the gibbon ape leukemia retrovirus. In an effort to isolate
related human genes to determine if these function as receptors for any
other retroviruses, van Zeijl et al. (1993, 1994) screened a human cDNA
library at low stringency using GLVR1 (137570) as a probe. A single
GLVR1-related cDNA (designated GLVR2) was isolated and found to have 62%
identity to GLVR1 and its amino acid sequence. Expression of GLVR2 in
CHO-K1 cells, which are resistant to infection by amphotropic virus
because of the absence of a receptor, rendered the cells sensitive to
infection by the virus. Thus, GLVR2 is a receptor for amphotropic virus.
Van Zeijl et al. (1994) pointed out that expression of the GLVR2 protein
might be a requirement for infection of human cells by amphotropic
retroviral vectors for purposes of gene therapy.

MAPPING

Using human-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids and a retroviral
vector, Garcia et al. (1991) mapped the receptor for the amphotropic
murine leukemia virus to the pericentromeric region of human chromosome
8.

Using a somatic cell hybrid panel, van Zeijl et al. (1994) mapped the
GLVR2 gene to human chromosome 8, a location distinct from that for
GLVR1, which maps to human chromosome 2. The location of GLVR2 on
chromosome 8 highlighted the possibility that the locus may encode a
receptor for the murine amphotropic virus because a receptor gene
(MLVAR) for this virus was mapped to chromosome 8 by Garcia et al.
(1991).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 7 families with idiopathic basal ganglia
calcification-1 (213600), Wang et al. (2012) identified 7 different
heterozygous mutations in the SLC20A2 gene (see, e.g.,
158378.0001-158378.0005) that segregated with the disorder. Three
families were of Chinese origin, 3 of Spanish origin, and 1 was
Brazilian. In vitro functional expression studies in Xenopus oocytes
showed that all the missense mutations resulted in substantially
impaired transport of inorganic phosphate. However, expression of 2
mutant missense proteins with wildtype SLC20A2 did not result in
diminished transport activity, suggesting haploinsufficiency as a
pathogenic mechanism. Wang et al. (2012) postulated that functional loss
of SLC20A2 in the brain may result in regional accumulation of inorganic
phosphate in the extracellular matrix, causing calcium phosphate
deposition. No genotype/phenotype correlations were observed.

In 13 (41%) of 29 families with IGBC, Hsu et al. (2013) identified 13
different heterozygous mutations in the SLC20A2 gene (see, e.g.,
158378.0003 and 158378.0006-158378.0008). Variants predicted to be
deleterious cosegregated with the disease in 5 families. No carriers of
SLC20A2 variants were unaffected, suggesting 100% sensitivity of the
clinical or CT evaluation. In contrast, several individuals in 3 large
families who received an affected disease status based upon clinical
examination or CT scan did not carry mutations. Hsu et al. (2013) noted
that CT calcifications may be found in up to 1% of the general
population, and that a wide range of neuropsychiatric manifestations can
be considered part of the disorder. The findings established SLC20A2 as
a key gene for familial IBGC.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BASAL GANGLIA CALCIFICATION, IDIOPATHIC, 1
SLC20A2, GLY498ARG

In affected members of a 5-generation Chinese family with idiopathic
basal ganglia calcification-1 (IBGC1; 213600) originally reported by Dai
et al. (2010), Wang et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 1492G-A
transition in the SLC20A2 gene, resulting in a gly498-to-arg (G498R)
substitution in a highly conserved residue in transmembrane domain VIII.
The mutation was not found in 508 Chinese controls, in the 1000 Genomes
Project database, or in 2,439 control exomes. In vitro functional
expression studies in Xenopus oocytes showed that the mutation resulted
in substantially impaired transport of inorganic phosphate. In this
family, 9 individuals had idiopathic basal ganglia calcification, but
only 4 had clinical symptoms of headache, 1 also with depression; 5 were
asymptomatic. Brain imaging of the 36-year-old proband showed symmetric
calcium deposition in the caudate nucleus, lentiform nucleus, globus
pallidus, inferior part of thalamus, and occipitalis lobes. All were
adults, except for 1 asymptomatic 9-year-old boy, who had calcifications
only in the globus pallidus.

BASAL GANGLIA CALCIFICATION, IDIOPATHIC, 1
SLC20A2, SER601TRP

In affected members of a 4-generation Chinese family with IBGC1
(213600), Wang et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 1802C-G
transversion in the SLC20A2 gene, resulting in a ser601-to-trp (S601W)
substitution in a highly conserved residue in transmembrane domain XI.
The mutation was not found in 508 Chinese controls, the 1000 Genomes
Project, or 2,439 control exomes. In vitro functional expression studies
in Xenopus oocytes showed that the mutation resulted in substantially
impaired transport of inorganic phosphate. However, expression of the
mutant protein with wildtype SLC20A2 did not result in diminished
transport activity. Five patients were clinically asymptomatic and 1 had
parkinsonism and cerebral infarction at age 73 years. Brain imaging
showed calcium deposition primarily limited to the basal ganglia and
inferior part of the thalamus. However, 2 affected sisters had a much
more severe disorder, with early-onset epilepsy, developmental delay,
and mental retardation. Brain imaging of these 2 girls showed marked
symmetric calcium deposition in the basal ganglia, inferior part of the
thalamus, cerebellum, frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices, and
subcortex. These 2 girls were found to carry a heterozygous S601W
mutation inherited from their affected father, as well as a
ser121-to-cys (S121C) substitution in the SLC20A2 gene inherited from
their unaffected mother. The S121C substitution was not found in 508
Chinese controls, but did not show a significant impairment of SLC20A2
transport activity. Thus, its contribution to the severe phenotype
lacked clearly supportive evidence.

.0003

SLC20A2, SER601LEU

In 2 affected members of a Chinese family with IBGC1 (213600), Wang et
al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 1802C-T transition in the SLC20A2
gene, resulting in a ser601-to-leu (S601L) substitution in a highly
conserved residue in transmembrane domain XI. The mutation was not found
in 508 Chinese controls, the 1000 Genomes Project, or in 2,439 control
exomes. In vitro functional expression studies in Xenopus oocytes showed
that the mutation resulted in substantially impaired transport of
inorganic phosphate.

Hsu et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous S601L substitution in the
SLC20A2 gene in a patient (family F23) with IBGC1 who was of Ashkenazi
Jewish and Russian descent.

.0004
BASAL GANGLIA CALCIFICATION, IDIOPATHIC, 1
SLC20A2, GLU575LYS

In 2 affected members of a Spanish family with IBCG1 (213600), Wang et
al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 1723G-A transition in the SLC20A2
gene, resulting in a glu575-to-lys (E575K) substitution in a highly
conserved residue in transmembrane domain X. The mutation was not found
in 288 Spanish controls, the 1000 Genomes Project, or in 2,439 control
exomes. In vitro functional expression studies in Xenopus oocytes showed
that the mutation resulted in substantially impaired transport of
inorganic phosphate. However, expression of the mutant protein with
wildtype SLC20A2 did not result in diminished transport activity.

.0005
BASAL GANGLIA CALCIFICATION, IDIOPATHIC, 1
SLC20A2, THR595MET

In a Spanish patient with IBGC1 (213600), Wang et al. (2012) identified
a heterozygous 1784C-T transition in the SLC20A2 gene, resulting in a
thr595-to-met (T595M) substitution in a highly conserved residue in
transmembrane domain XI. The mutation was not found in 288 Spanish
controls, the 1000 Genomes Project, or 2,439 control exomes. In vitro
functional expression studies in Xenopus oocytes showed that the
mutation resulted in substantially impaired transport of inorganic
phosphate.

.0006
BASAL GANGLIA CALCIFICATION, IDIOPATHIC, 1
SLC20A2, 1-BP DEL, 508T

In 9 affected members of a large multigenerational family (F1) with
IBGC1 (213600), originally reported by Geschwind et al. (1999), Hsu et
al. (2013) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (c.508delC) in exon 4
of the SLC20A2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination
(Leu170Ter). The family was previously reported to show linkage to a
locus on chromosome 14q13, but Hsu et al. (2013) demonstrated that the
mutation responsible for the phenotype was in the SLC20A2 gene on
chromosome 8p. Two individuals who were clinically affected and were
part of the original linkage study were found not to carry the mutation,
which may have contributed to the previous erroneous linkage results.
The variant was not present in the dbSNP, NHLBI Exome Variant Server, or
1000 Genomes Project databases.

In 9 affected members of a family (F2) with IBGC1 (213600), originally
reported by Brodaty et al. (2002), Hsu et al. (2013) identified a
heterozygous 4-bp deletion (c.1828_1831delTCCC) in exon 11 of the
SLC20A2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination
(Ser610AlafsTer17). The variant was not present in the dbSNP, NHLBI
Exome Variant Server, or 1000 Genomes Project databases. One clinically
affected family member did not carry the mutation.

In 8 affected members of a family (F5) of Irish-English descent with
IBGC1 (213600), previously reported by Manyam et al. (2001) and Oliveira
et al. (2004), Hsu et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous 2-bp deletion
(c.583_584GT) in exon 5 of the SLC20A2 gene, resulting in a frameshift
and premature termination (Val195LeufsTer61). The variant was not
present in the dbSNP, NHLBI Exome Variant Server, or 1000 Genomes
databases. Two clinically affected family members did not carry the
mutation.

605469	TITLE *605469 LYSINE-SPECIFIC DEMETHYLASE 4C; KDM4C
;;JUMONJI DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2C; JMJD2C;;
GENE AMPLIFIED IN SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA 1; GASC1;;
KIAA0780
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned JMJD2C, which they designated
KIAA0780. The transcript contains an MIR repetitive element in its
3-prime UTR, and the deduced 1,100-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with an S. cerevisiae zinc finger protein. RT-PCR ELISA
detected JMJD2C expression in all tissues examined. Highest expression
was in brain, and lowest was in skeletal muscle and spleen.

Frequent amplification of DNA copy number at chromosome 9p24-p23 has
been demonstrated in cell lines derived from esophageal squamous cell
carcinomas (Yang et al., 2000). Yang et al. (2000) used fluorescence in
situ hybridization and Southern blot analysis to map the 9p24-p23
amplicon. They then screened target genes/transcripts present within
this amplicon by Northern blot analysis. With this strategy, they cloned
a gene, JMJD2C, which they designated GASC1, that was amplified and
overexpressed in several cell lines. The deduced 1,056-amino acid GASC1
protein contains 2 PHD finger motifs and a PX domain. PHD finger motifs
are zinc finger-like sequences found in nuclear proteins that
participate in chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation and are
present in a number of protooncogenes. Yang et al. (2000) suggested that
overexpression of GASC1 may play an important role in the development
and/or progression of various types of cancer, including esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma.

By searching for sequences similar to JMJD1C (604503), Katoh and Katoh
(2004) identified several JMJD2 family genes, including JMJD2C. JMJD2C
encodes a deduced 1,056-amino acid protein. Like JMJD2A (609764) and
JMJD2B (609765), JMJD2C contains a JmjN domain, a JmjC domain, a JD2H
domain, 2 TUDOR domains, and a bipartite nuclear localization signal
that overlaps the C-terminal part of the second TUDOR domain. JmjN is a
small domain found in the Jumonji family of transcription factors (see
601594). JmjC is a putative enzymatic domain. JD2H is a region
containing 2 cys-his clusters with weak similarity to a PHD domain.

GENE FUNCTION

In a search for proteins and complexes interacting with trimethylated
histone H3 lysine-9 (H3K9) (see 602810), Cloos et al. (2006) identified
JMJD2C (GASC1). Cloos et al. (2006) showed that 3 members of the JMJD2
subfamily of proteins demethylate tri- or dimethylated H3K9 in vitro
through a hydroxylation reaction requiring iron and alpha-ketoglutarate
as cofactors. They demonstrated also that ectopic expression of JMJD2C
or other JMJD2 members markedly decreased tri- and dimethylated H3K9
levels, increased monomethylated H3K9, delocalized HP1 (see 604478), and
reduced heterochromatin in vivo. In agreement with studies indicating a
contribution of JMJD2C to tumor development, inhibition of JMJD2C
expression decreased cell proliferation.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the JMJD2C gene to chromosome 9 by radiation
hybrid analysis. By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2004)
mapped the JMJD2C gene (KDM4C) to chromosome 9p24.1.

;;EME1, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF, 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

EME2 forms a heterodimer with MUS81 (606591) that functions as an XPF
(278760)-type flap/fork endonuclease in DNA repair (Ciccia et al.,
2007).

CLONING

By searching for homologs of S. pombe Eme1, followed by PCR, Ciccia et
al. (2003) cloned EME1 (610885) and EME2. The deduced 245-amino acid
EME2 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 26 kD and shares 44%
identity with EME1.

By searching for proteins similar to the C-terminal region of MUS81,
followed by PCR of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Ciccia et al. (2007) cloned
EME2. The deduced 379-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass
of 41.2 kD and shares 39% identity with EME1. It has an inactive ERCC4
(133520)-type nuclease domain and a C-terminal helix-hairpin-helix
motif.

GENE FUNCTION

Ciccia et al. (2003) showed that recombinant EME2 interacted with
recombinant MUS81.

Ciccia et al. (2007) found that the EME2/MUS81 heterodimer exhibited DNA
endonuclease activity against 3-prime flap and splayed arm substrates.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ciccia et al. (2003) mapped the EME2 gene
to chromosome 16p13.3.

615507	TITLE *615507 NISCHARIN; NISCH
;;IMIDAZOLINE RECEPTOR ANTISERA-SELECTED; IRAS;;
KIAA0975
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Full-length nischarin is an integrin-binding protein with a role in cell
motility (Alahari et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using antisera developed against nonadrenergic imidazoline-binding
proteins to screen a human hippocampal cDNA expression library, Ivanov
et al. (1998) cloned NISCH. The deduced 595-amino acid protein has 4
transmembrane domains, a zinc finger domain, and a glutamic acid- and
aspartic acid-rich region. NISCH shows regions of similarity with
chromogranin-A precursor (118910) and ryanodine receptor (see RYR1,
180901). Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of 6.0- and
9.5-kb transcripts in all 36 human tissues examined. The smaller
transcript predominated, and highest overall expression was detected in
pituitary. In situ hybridization of rat brain showed strongest
expression in pyramidal cell layers of hippocampus and granular layer
and hillus of the dentate gyrus.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned NISCH, which they designated
KIAA0975. The deduced protein contains 1,528 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected variable NISCH expression in all adult and fetal tissues
examined. Very high expression was detected in fetal brain, followed by
adult kidney, testis, ovary, brain, and spinal cord. Within specific
adult brain regions, highest expression was detected in corpus callosum,
amygdala, cerebellum, and caudate nucleus.

By EST database analysis, Piletz et al. (2003) identified 3 splice
variants of NISCH, which they called IRAS. The transcripts differed in
splicing between exons 13 and 14. The transcript of the primary isoform,
IRAS-M, encodes the full-length 1,504-amino acid protein. The shorter
transcript, IRAS-S, includes an internal polyadenylation signal sequence
and encodes a deduced 515-amino acid protein. The longer truncated
transcript, IRAS-L, encodes a deduced 583-amino acid protein. The 3
proteins are identical for the first 510 amino acids, which includes the
PxxP and leucine-rich repeat domains. Only IRAS-M contains the putative
imidazoline-binding region, alpha-5 integrin (ITGA5; 135620)-binding
domain, and C-terminal domain with similarity to insulin receptor
substrate proteins (see IRS1, 147545). Northern blot analysis detected
IRAS transcripts at 9.5, 5.5, and 3.0 kb in all human brain regions
examined and in spinal cord. In most areas, IRAS-M predominated.
Following expression in CHO cells, SDS-PAGE detected IRAS-M, IRAS-S, and
IRAS-L at apparent molecular masses of 167, 57, and 65 kD, respectively.

Alahari et al. (2004) stated that full-length mouse nischarin is 1,354
amino acids long. It has an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat region,
followed by 2 PxxP motifs, an integrin-binding domain, a central
proline- and alanine-rich domain, and a C-terminal leucine zipper with
an additional PxxP motif. The integrin-binding domain contains a leucine
zipper and a cytochrome P450 (see CYP3A4, 124010) cysteine heme-iron
ligand signature.

GENE FUNCTION

Piletz et al. (2003) found that human IRAS-M and IRAS-L, but not IRAS-S,
increased binding of radiolabeled iodoclonidine to transfected CHO
cells.

Alahari et al. (2004) stated that full-length mouse nischarin interacts
with the cytoplasmic domain of alpha-5 integrin in the alpha-5/beta-1
integrin (ITGB1; 135630) complex and that nischarin inhibits cell
migration when overexpressed. By cotransfecting COS-7 cells, they found
that nischarin also specifically interacted with the kinase domain of
human PAK1 (602590), which is involved in cell motility. Mouse nischarin
and human PAK1 colocalized to membrane ruffles in transfected rat
embryonic fibroblasts. Domain and mutation analysis revealed that an
N-terminal domain of nischarin interacted with PAK1 in the active 'open'
conformation, which normally occurs following Rac (see 602048)-dependent
phosphorylation. Binding to nischarin inhibited PAK1 kinase activity and
cell migration, and the presence of alpha-5/beta-1 integrin further
enhanced the interaction between nischarin and PAK1. Knockout of
nischarin in rat PC12 cells via small interfering RNA resulted in Pak
activation and increased cell migration. Alahari et al. (2004) concluded
that nischarin has a role in regulating cell migration.

Using reciprocal coprecipitation assays, Jain et al. (2013) found that
endogenous nischarin and the kinase LKB1 (STK11; 602216) interacted in
the cytoplasm of human breast cancer cell lines. Knockdown of both
nischarin and LKB1 enhanced cell migration, which was due to elevated
PAK1 and LIMK1 (601329) phosphorylation. Absence of nischarin and LKB1
increased breast cancer cell growth following injection in nude mice.

GENE STRUCTURE

Piletz et al. (2003) determined that the NISCH gene contains 21 exons
and spans 37 kb. Intron 13 is subject to alternative splicing and
contains stop codons and an internal polyadenylation site.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Piletz et al. (2003) mapped the NISCH gene
to chromosome 3p21.1.

176940	TITLE *176940 S100 CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN A1; S100A1
;;S100-ALPHA; S100A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

S100 proteins, such as S100A1, are small, acidic Ca(2+)-binding proteins
that transduce Ca(2+) signals via interaction with intracellular target
proteins (Mandinova et al., 1998).

CLONING

S100 protein is a 21,000-Da component first isolated from brain by Moore
(1965). Immunocytochemical studies demonstrated that S100 protein is
produced by a wide variety of normal and neoplastic cells of mesodermal,
neuroectodermal, and epithelial origin (Herrera et al., 1988). It has 2
subunits, alpha and beta (S100B; 176990) (Isobe et al., 1978). The S100
molecule is a dimer; thus there are 3 forms of S100: alpha-alpha, known
as S100a(0); alpha-beta, known as S100a; and beta-beta, known as S100b.

Engelkamp et al. (1992) cloned S100A1, which they called S100-alpha,
from a human heart cDNA library. The deduced 94-amino acid protein has a
characteristic S100 domain structure, with N- and C-terminal hydrophobic
regions and 2 central EF-hand calcium loops. Northern blot analysis
detected highest expression of a major 650-bp transcript and a minor
750-bp transcript in heart and skeletal muscle. Expression was lower in
brain, very low in kidney, and absent in other tissues.

Using immunofluorescence analysis and confocal laser scanning
microscopy, Mandinova et al. (1998) showed that S100A1, S100A2 (176993),
S100A4 (114210), and S100A6 (114110) localized to distinct intracellular
compartments in cultured human vascular and intestinal smooth muscle
cells. S100A1 and S100A4 were associated predominantly with the
sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and with actin stress fibers.

Using immunofluorescence analysis, Pleger et al. (2008) showed that
endogenous S100A1 was expressed in cultured human, rat, and mouse
endothelial cells and localized to the perinuclear region.

GENE FUNCTION

Mandinova et al. (1998) showed that elevated cytosolic Ca(2+) led to
relocalization of S100A1, S100A4, and S100A6 from the SR to vesicle-like
structures around the nucleus in human vascular smooth muscle cells. The
localization of stress fiber-associated S100A1 and S100A4 remained
unchanged.

Most et al. (2001) showed that S100A1 overexpression enhanced cardiac
contractile performance and established the concept of S100A1 as a
regulator of myocardial contractility. S100A1 improved cardiac
contractile performance both by regulating SR calcium ion handling and
myofibrillar calcium ion responsiveness.

Most et al. (2003) showed that application of human S100A1 to
functionally intact but permeabilized mouse extensor digitorum longus
and soleus muscle fibers resulted in enhanced caffeine-induced SR Ca(2+)
release and Ca(2+)-induced isometric force transients in a
dose-dependent manner. The C-terminal region of S100A1 and the hinge
region between the EF hands differentially enhanced SR Ca(2+) release,
with the C-terminal region showing higher activity. S100A1 did not
influence SR Ca(2+) uptake or myofilament Ca(2+)
sensitivity/cooperativity.

Using recombinant human and bovine proteins for pull-down assays, Okada
et al. (2004) showed that S100A1, but not calmodulin (see 114180),
interacted with heat-shock chaperone components HSP90 (see 140571),
HSP70 (see 140550), FKBP52 (FKBP4; 600611), and CYP40 (PPID; 601753).
Coimmunoprecipitation studies confirmed the interactions. S100A1
potently protected several enzymes from heat-induced aggregation and
inactivation, and it suppressed aggregation of chemically denatured
proteins during refolding. The chaperone activity of S100A1 was
antagonized by calmodulin antagonists. Overexpression of S100A1 in COS-7
cells protected transiently expressed firefly luciferase and E. coli
beta-galactosidase from inactivation during heat shock. Okada et al.
(2004) concluded that S100A1 can function as a molecular chaperone and
is a component of the HSP70/HSP90 multichaperone complex.

Pleger et al. (2008) found that both basal and acetylcholine-induced
endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production were impaired in endothelial
cells from S100a1-knockout mice, which develop hypertension (see ANIMAL
MODEL). Impaired endothelial NO production could be attributed, at least
in part, to diminished agonist-induced calcium transients. Silencing of
S100a1 in wildtype rat endothelial cells also reduced intracellular
calcium concentration and NO generation. Conversely, S100A1
overexpression in human endothelial cells increased NO generation, which
could be blocked by an inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (see ITPR1;
147265) blocker. S100A1 expression was downregulated in cultured human
and rat endothelial cells by angiotensin II (106150) or ET1 (EDN1;
131240) stimulation and in rat hearts following myocardial infarction.

MAPPING

By spot-blot hybridization analysis of flow-sorted chromosomes, Morii et
al. (1991) showed that the S100A and S100B genes are located on
chromosomes 1 and 21, respectively. Engelkamp et al. (1993) assigned the
S100A gene to 1q21 by in situ hybridization. It is located in a cluster
that contains at least 5 other genes of the S100 type.

Schafer et al. (1995) isolated a YAC clone from 1q21 on which 9
different genes coding for S100 calcium-binding proteins could be
localized. The clustered organization of S100 genes in the 1q21 region
allowed the authors to introduce a new logical nomenclature for these
genes based on the physical arrangement on the chromosome. The genes
were designated S100A1 through S100A9 (123886) in a direction from
telomere to centromere. They commented on the large number of different
names that had been given to the S100 proteins; S100A8 (123885) had 9
different names. Their Table 1 gave the new nomenclature for the S100
genes clustered on 1q21, as well as for 3 others located on other
chromosomes: S100B on chromosome 21, calbindin 3 (CALB3; 302020) on the
X chromosome, and S100P (600614) on chromosome 4.

ANIMAL MODEL

Du et al. (2002) found that S100a1-null mice had normal cardiac function
under baseline conditions, but they showed significantly reduced
contraction and relaxation rate responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation
that were associated with reduced Ca(2+) sensitivity. In S100a1-null
mice, basal left-ventricular contractility deteriorated following 3-week
pressure overload by thoracic aorta constriction despite a normal
adaptive hypertrophy. Heterozygotes also had an impaired response to
acute beta-adrenergic stimulation, but they maintained normal
contractility in response to chronic pressure overload that coincided
with S100a1 upregulation to wildtype levels. In contrast to other
genetic models with impaired cardiac contractility, loss of S100a1 did
not lead to cardiac hypertrophy or dilation in aged mice.

Pleger et al. (2008) found that hypertension developed in
S100a1-knockout mice. Thoracic aortas obtained from S100a1-knockout mice
showed significantly reduced relaxation in response to acetylcholine
compared with wildtype vessels. Both basal and acetylcholine-induced
endothelial NO production were impaired in mutant endothelial cells,
which could be attributed, at least in part, to diminished
agonist-induced calcium transients.

607690	TITLE *607690 SAR1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG B; SAR1B
;;SAR1A, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG 2; SARA2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases, followed by PCR, He et al. (2002) cloned human
SAR1B, which they called SARA1. The deduced 198-amino acid SARA1 protein
contains 4 highly conserved GTPase motifs. Northern blot analysis
detected strong expression of a major transcript of 2.4 to 4.4 kb in all
tissues examined. Smaller and larger variants were also detected in most
tissues.

By a genomewide screen of 6 affected families to find a gene mutant in
lipid absorption disorders, Jones et al. (2003) identified the SAR1B
gene, which they called SARA2, in a region of apparent homozygosity on
5q31.1 shared by 4 affected families. SAR1B belongs to the
Sar1-ADP-ribosylation factor family of small GTPases (Takai et al.,
2001), which govern the intracellular trafficking of proteins in coat
protein (COP)-coated vesicles (Schekman and Orci, 1996). The human
SARA1B protein shares 99% amino acid identity with hamster Sar1. SARA1B
is expressed in many tissues including small intestine, liver, muscle,
and brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

He et al. (2002) determined that the SAR1B gene contains 8 exons and
spans over 60 kb.

Jones et al. (2003) determined that the human SAR1B gene comprises 7
exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, He et al. (2002) mapped the SAR1B gene to
chromosome 5q23-q31.1.

The SAR1B gene maps to chromosome 5q31.1, within 94 kb of the SEC24A
gene (607183) (Jones et al., 2003).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Chylomicron retention disease (CMRD; 246700), also known as Anderson
disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of severe fat malabsorption
associated with failure to thrive in infancy. The condition is
characterized by deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins, low blood
cholesterol levels, and a selective absence of chylomicrons from blood.
Affected individuals accumulate chylomicron-like particles in
membrane-bound compartments of enterocytes, which contain large
cytosolic lipid droplets. In affected members of several families with
CMRD, Jones et al. (2003) identified homozygous or compound heterozygous
mutations in the SAR1B gene (607690.0001-607690.0006). Jones et al.
(2003) found no mutations in a second human isoform SAR1A (607691),
located on chromosome 10, in families with these disorders.

Charcosset et al. (2008) identified mutations in the SAR1B gene (see,
e.g., 607690.0007; 607690.0008) in families with CMRD.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHYLOMICRON RETENTION DISEASE
SAR1B, GLY37ARG

In 2 members of an Algerian family with chylomicron retention disease
(246700), Jones et al. (2003) identified homozygosity for a 109G-A
transition in the SAR1B gene that caused a gly37-to-arg (G37R) amino
acid change, with the result that the protein had no affinity for
GDP/GTP. Both parents were heterozygous.

.0002
CHYLOMICRON RETENTION DISEASE
SAR1B, ASP137ASN

In 2 white Canadian families, Jones et al. (2003) found that affected
individuals with CMRD (246700) were homozygous for a 409G-A transition
in the SAR1B gene that resulted in an asp137 amino acid change (D137N)
and reduced affinity of the protein for GDP/GTP. In a third white
Canadian family, a single affected individual was a compound
heterozygote for the D137N mutation and a deletion of 2 nucleotides,
75-76delTG. The change occurring in leu28 resulted in frameshift and
premature termination at codon 34 (L28fsX34).

Charcosset et al. (2008) identified the D137N mutation in 3 additional
French Canadian families with chylomicron retention disease.

.0004
CHYLOMICRON RETENTION DISEASE
SAR1B, SER179ARG

In a white Canadian family, Jones et al. (2003) found that CMRD (246700)
was associated with homozygosity for a ser179-to-arg (S179R) mutation
arising from a 537T-A transversion in the SAR1B gene that resulted in
loss of affinity of the protein for GDP/GTP.

Charcosset et al. (2008) identified the S179R mutation in 3 additional
French Canadian families with chylomicron retention disease.

.0005
CHYLOMICRON RETENTION DISEASE
SAR1B, 4-BP DUP, 555TTAC

In a Turkish family, Jones et al. (2003) demonstrated that 2 children
with CMRD (246700) were homozygous for a 4-bp duplication of 555-558TTAC
in the SAR1B gene. The mutated allele replaced amino acids 187-198 of
the SARA2 protein with a new amino acid sequence. The translation was
arrested after codon 198. The mutation was predicted to affect helix 6
and to cause reduced affinity for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
membrane.

.0006
CHYLOMICRON RETENTION DISEASE
SAR1B, 349, G-C, -1

In an Italian family in which 2 brothers had chylomicron retention
disease (246700) and Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome (MSS; 248800), reported
by Aguglia et al. (2000), Jones et al. (2003) found homozygosity for a
splice site mutation in the SAR1B gene (349-1G-C). It was predicted that
this mutation could cause exon skipping, activation of a nearby cryptic
splice site, or production of an unspliced mRNA, any of which would
substantially disrupt the protein. In the same patients, Annesi et al.
(2007) identified a mutation in the SIL1 gene (R111X; 608005.0004),
responsible for MSS. The findings indicated that the patients had 2
distinct diseases due to mutations in 2 different genes, rather than
defects in a single gene leading to both disorders.

.0007
CHYLOMICRON RETENTION DISEASE
SAR1B, GLU122TER

In affected members of a Turkish family with chylomicron retention
disease (246700), Charcosset et al. (2008) identified a homozygous
364G-C transversion in the SAR1B gene, resulting in a glu122-to-ter
(E122X) substitution.

.0008
CHYLOMICRON RETENTION DISEASE
SAR1B, GLY185VAL

In a Portuguese child with chylomicron retention disease (246700),
Charcosset et al. (2008) identified a homozygous 554G-T transversion in
the SAR1B gene, resulting in a gly185-to-val (G185V) substitution.

602582	TITLE *602582 DELTEX, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; DTX1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

A fundamental cell-fate control mechanism regulating multicellular
development is defined by the Notch (see NOTCH1; 190198) signaling
pathway (Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1995). Developmental and genetic
studies of wildtype and activated Notch receptor expression in diverse
organisms have suggested that Notch plays a general role in development
by governing the ability of undifferentiated precursor cells to respond
to specific signals. Notch signaling has been conserved throughout
evolution and controls the differentiation of a broad spectrum of cell
types during development. Genetic studies in Drosophila have identified
several components of the Notch pathway. Two of the positive regulators
of the pathway are encoded by the deltex (dx) and suppressor of hairless
(147183) genes. Drosophila dx encodes a ubiquitous, novel cytoplasmic
protein of unknown biochemical function. Matsuno et al. (1998)
identified a human cDNA fragment in the EST database (Boguski et al.,
1993) encoding a peptide with similarity to a region of the Drosophila
deltex protein. Cloning of a full-length cDNA permitted deduction of the
amino acid sequence of the human deltex homolog, DTX1. The deduced
620-amino acid human protein contains 4 putative Src (190090) homology-3
(SH3) domain-binding sites and a C-terminal ring zinc finger domain. The
human and Drosophila proteins share 31% overall identity, with highest
conservation in the C-terminal region. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous expression of deltex in human and Drosophila. However, in
situ hybridization of human embryonic tissue indicated that expression
of DTX1 is not uniform. Greatest expression was detected in blood
vessels, a tissue associated with pathologies caused by Notch signaling
malfunction.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to ovine Dtx1,
Gupta-Rossi et al. (2003) identified DTX1. Northern blot analysis
detected a DTX1 transcript of about 4.4 kb that was strongly expressed
in purified tonsillar germinal center B cells and in a Burkitt lymphoma
cell line and centroblast-like tumors. Expression was high in spleen and
mesenteric lymph nodes and lower in thymus. DTX1 was also detected in
brain, heart, liver, kidney, pancreas, and testis.

Takeyama et al. (2003) stated that the 620-amino acid DTX1 protein
contains an N-terminal domain predicted to associate with Notch ankyrin
repeats, followed by a proline-rich region with potential SH3
domain-binding sites and a C-terminal domain that includes a classic
RING-H2 finger motif.

GENE FUNCTION

Matsuno et al. (1998) found that both human and Drosophila deltex bound
to Notch across species. Using the yeast interaction trap system, they
showed that Drosophila and human deltex bound to the human SH3
domain-containing protein GRB2 (108355). Results from 2 different
reporter assays allowed them for the first time to associate deltex with
Notch-dependent transcriptional events. They presented evidence linking
deltex to the modulation of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription
factor activity.

After confirming that DTX1 is expressed in T lymphocytes at all stages
of development, Izon et al. (2002) showed by RT-PCR analysis that murine
Dtx1 is also expressed in hemopoietic stem cells and in B lymphocytes in
all stages of development, whereas Notch1 expression is low in these
cells. The authors transduced hemopoietic progenitor cells with Dtx1
expressing green fluorescent protein and found that mice with these
cells had a marked decrease in T cells in the thymus, peripheral blood,
and spleen. Instead, the thymus in these mice and in organ culture
displayed B-cell development resembling the phenotype of mice deficient
in Notch1. Expression of DTX1 partially inhibited transactivation of a
CSL (RBPSUH; 147183)-dependent luciferase reporter by activated
intracellular NOTCH1 (ICN1) in human and mouse cells. The N terminus of
DTX1, which directly interacts with the NOTCH1 ankyrin repeats,
inhibited transactivation by ICN1 possessing the ankyrin repeats,
probably by inhibiting recruitment of coactivators to the C-terminal
transactivation domain of NOTCH1. Izon et al. (2002) concluded that DTX1
is an inhibitor of NOTCH1 activity, a conclusion earlier suggested by
the studies of Sestan et al. (1999) on dendritic outgrowth from human
neurons.

Using an in vitro ubiquitination assay, Takeyama et al. (2003) showed
that recombinant DTX1 functioned as a ubiquitin E3 ligase. It showed
highest ubiquitination activity in conjunction with the E2 enzyme UBCH5A
(UBE2D1; 602961).

Using subtractive hybridization, Gupta-Rossi et al. (2003) found that
expression of Dtx1 was upregulated in sheep ileal Peyer patch follicular
B cells in concert with immunoglobulin gene hypermutation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lee et al. (2000) determined that the DTX1 gene contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

Lee et al. (2000) mapped the DTX1 gene to 12q24 by radiation hybrid
mapping and FISH.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Because the DTX1 gene maps within the critical region for Noonan
syndrome (163950), Lee et al. (2000) performed mutation analysis in 10
probands with Noonan syndrome and their family members. No mutations
were found; all polymorphisms were observed in normal control samples.
Analysis of the polymorphisms present in the probands demonstrated 2
alleles of the DTX1 gene in all 10 individuals, ruling out the
possibility of a total gene deletion.

ANIMAL MODEL

By generating Dtx1 -/- mice, Hsiao et al. (2009) determined that Dtx1 is
important in T-cell anergy and that it is a target of Nfat (NFATC1;
600489). Immunoblot analysis showed Dtx1 upregulation in anergic T
cells. Mutation analysis with deletion of N- or C-terminal portions of
Dtx1 indicated that T-cell activation was inhibited by Dtx1 in both
E3-dependent and E3-independent mechanisms. Mice lacking Dtx1 have
increased T-cell activation and systemic autoimmune disease. Hsiao et
al. (2009) concluded that DTX1 contributes to T-cell tolerance.

609379	TITLE *609379 LIPOCALIN 6; LCN6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lipocalins are ligand-binding proteins that function in a wide variety
of processes (see 151675) and exhibit conserved beta-strand basket-like
structures. Using database analysis and cDNA sequencing from a human
caput library, Hamil et al. (2003) identified LCN6. The 163-amino acid
LCN6 protein contains a predicted 20-amino acid signal peptide. Hamil et
al. (2003) showed that human LCN6 is 93% identical to rhesus monkey Lcn6
and lacks a second, C-terminal cysteine found in many lipocalins. The
LCN6 protein contains multiple phosphorylation sites, and structural
prediction programs showed that LCN6 displays the characteristic
lipocalin 3-dimensional structure. Northern blot analysis revealed
robust expression of a 1-kb LCN6 transcript in epididymis. Using
immunohistochemistry, Hamil et al. (2003) demonstrated strong expression
of LCN6 protein in the caput epithelium and lumen; immunofluorescence of
human spermatozoa showed strong LCN6 expression in large patches in the
postacrosomal region of the head.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Northern blot analysis, Hamil et al. (2003) showed that LCN6
expression in rhesus monkeys is not affected by castration.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hamil et al. (2003) showed that the LCN6 gene contains 7 exons and spans
4.5 kb.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Hamil et al. (2003) mapped the LCN6 gene to
chromosome 9q34, in a region rich in lipocalin genes.

612667	TITLE *612667 HOLLIDAY JUNCTION RECOGNITION PROTEIN; HJURP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using microarray analysis to screen for genes upregulated in primary
nonsmall cell lung cancers, Kato et al. (2007) identified HJURP. The
deduced 748-amino acid protein has an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and
3 putative ATM (607585)-binding S/TQ motifs. Northern blot analysis
detected a 2.7-kb transcript that was expressed highly in testis and
more weakly in thymus and bone marrow. Western blot analysis detected
HJURP at an apparent molecular mass of 83 kD, which was reduced
following phosphatase treatment. In synchronized human osteosarcoma
cells, HJURP localized to the nucleus and was associated with different
subnuclear structures at various phases of the cell cycle.

GENE FUNCTION

Kato et al. (2007) found that expression of HJURP mRNA and protein was
upregulated in the majority of lung cancer cell lines examined, but not
in small airway epithelial cells from normal bronchial epithelium.
Elevated HJURP expression was associated with poor prognosis. Using
human lung cancer cell lines, Kato et al. (2007) found that HJURP
coimmunoprecipitated with the Holliday junction protein MSH5 (603382)
and with NBS1 (602667), a component of a protein complex involved in DNA
double-strand break repair. HJURP expression was increased by genotoxic
stress, but not in ATM-deficient cells. Inhibition of ATM reduced the
level of HJURP protein, but not transcript, suggesting that HJURP is an
ATM substrate and that phosphorylation stabilizes the HJURP protein.
HJURP bound to synthetic nucleotides with a Holliday junction structure
in a dose-dependent manner in vitro, and it associated with ribosomal
DNA in osteosarcoma cell extracts. Knockdown of HJURP with small
interfering RNA increased the proportion of cells in G2-M phase and with
4n and 16n chromosomes. HJURP-knockdown cells showed increased
chromosomal instability and chromosomal fusion, and they underwent
premature senescence. Kato et al. (2007) concluded that HJURP has a role
in chromosomal stability in immortalized cancer cells.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the HJURP gene to chromosome 2q37.1 based on an
alignment of the HJURP sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK074809) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

;;LCOR-LIKE PROTEIN;;
MBLK1-RELATED PROTEIN 1; MLR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kunieda et al. (2003) cloned mouse Lcorl, which they called Mlr1, based
on its homology with the honeybee transcription factor Mblk1. The
deduced 517-amino acid protein contains a DNA-binding motif and a motif
conserved in Mlr2 (LCOR; 607698). Northern blot analysis detected high
expression of Mlr1 in testis, with lower expression in kidney, liver,
and heart, and lowest expression in brain. In situ hybridization of
adult mouse testis detected Mlr1 in nearly all seminiferous tubules.
Mlr1 was highly expressed in spermatocytes, but not in spermatogonia or
spermatids, and it was not expressed in testis of mutant mice lacking
germ cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a reporter gene assay, Kunieda et al. (2003) showed that mouse
Mlr1 bound and activated transcription from the DNA element recognized
by honeybee Mblk1.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the LCORL
gene to chromosome 4 (TMAP STS-R67597).

Gudbjartsson et al. (2008) mapped the LCORL gene to chromosome 4p15.

606692	TITLE *606692 TNF RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED FACTOR 7; TRAF7
;;RING FINGER AND WD REPEAT DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; RFWD1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF; see 191160) receptor-associated factors,
such as TRAF7, are signal transducers for members of the TNF receptor
superfamily (see 191190). TRAFs are composed of an N-terminal
cysteine/histidine-rich region containing zinc RING and/or zinc finger
motifs; a coiled-coil (leucine zipper) motif; and a homologous region
that defines the TRAF family, the TRAF domain, which is involved in
self-association and receptor binding.

CLONING

Using an integrated approach comprising tandem affinity purification,
liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, network analysis, and directed
functional perturbation studies with RNA interference (RNAi) to map the
TNF/NFKB (see 164011) pathway, Bouwmeester et al. (2004) identified
RFWD1, which they termed TRAF7, as an interactor with MEKK3 (MAP3K3;
602539). The predicted 670-amino acid protein has an N-terminal RING
finger domain, followed by a noncanonical TRAF domain, a coiled-coil
(CC) domain, and 7 C-terminal WD40 repeats.

GENE FUNCTION

By mutation and coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Bouwmeester et al.
(2004) determined that the WD40 repeats of TRAF7 bind MEKK3, whereas
homodimerization of TRAF7 occurs through the central TRAF and CC
domains. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated TRAF7 localization in a
vesicular pattern in the cytosol in the presence or absence of MEKK3.
SDS-PAGE analysis suggested that MEKK3 phosphorylates sites in the
N-terminal region of TRAF7 and induces ubiquitination. In the presence
of E1 (UBE1; 314370) and E2 (see UBE2E2; 602163) activating and
conjugating enzymes, a TRAF7 fragment containing the RING domain was
ubiquitinated, indicating that TRAF7 may have E3 ubiquitin ligase (see
UBE3A; 601623) activity. Luciferase reporter and RNAi analysis
established that coexpression of wildtype TRAF7 and MEKK3 resulted in a
synergistic activation of NFKB and AP1 (165160). Bouwmeester et al.
(2004) proposed that TRAF7, in conjunction with MEKK3, might act like
TAK1 (MAP3K7; 602614) and TRAF6 (602355) in relaying signals, impinging
on the activation of JNK (601158) and p38 MAP kinases (see MAPK14;
600289), most likely by means of intermediate effectors.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RFWD1
gene to chromosome 16 (TMAP SHGC-601344).

609221	TITLE *609221 N-ACETYLTRANSFERASE 10; NAT10
;;N-ACETYLTRANSFERASE-LIKE PROTEIN;;
ALP;;
KIAA1709
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 11 associated with WAGR
syndrome (194072), Gawin et al. (1999) identified and cloned NAT10,
which they designated clone 193700. Northern blot analysis detected
variable expression of a 4.5-kb transcript in all human tissues
examined, with highest expression in heart, brain, placenta, and
pancreas.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned KIAA1709. The deduced protein
contains 1,028 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression in
liver and intermediate expression in all other adult and fetal tissues
and specific adult brain regions examined.

By yeast 1-hybrid screening of a HeLa cell cDNA library using the
promoter region of the catalytic subunit of human telomerase, TERT
(187270), as bait, followed by 5-prime RACE, Lv et al. (2003) cloned
ALP. The deduced 834-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass
of 94 kD. ALP contains an N-acetyltransferase domain accompanied by an
ATP/GTP-binding motif and an ATPase domain. Western blot analysis of
HeLa cells detected ALP at an apparent molecular mass of 94 kD.
Immunocytochemical analysis detected ALP mainly in HeLa cell nuclei.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay, Lv et al. (2003)
confirmed that ALP interacts with the TERT promoter. Cotransfection of
HeLa cells with a reporter construct driven by the TERT promoter and ALP
cDNA resulted in increased reporter activity. Cotransfection of the
reporter with antisense ALP cDNA resulted decreased reporter activity.
Cells overexpressing ALP showed higher telomerase activity, whereas
cells with antisense ALP showed decreased telomerase activity. In vitro
analysis showed that ALP specifically catalyzed acetylation of histones.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lv et al. (2003) determined that the ALP gene contains 24 exons and
spans about 33 kb.

MAPPING

By analyzing a PAC contig covering chromosome 11p14.1-p13, Gawin et al.
(1999) mapped the NAT10 gene to chromosome 11p13, centromeric to the
GPIAP1 gene (601178) and telomeric to the CAT gene (115500).

By genomic sequence analysis, Lv et al. (2003) mapped the ALP gene to
chromosome 11p13.

604649	TITLE *604649 TUBULIN-SPECIFIC CHAPERONE D; TBCD
DESCRIPTION See TBCC (602971) for background information on microtubules and
tubulin-specific chaperones.

CLONING

By screening human brain cDNAs for the potential to encode proteins
larger than 50 kD, Nagase et al. (1999) isolated a TBCD cDNA, which they
called KIAA0988. The deduced 1,192-amino acid full-length TBCD protein
shares 80.5% amino acid sequence identity with bovine tubulin-folding
cofactor D across 1,188 amino acids. RT-PCR followed by ELISA detected
TBCD expression at varying levels in all human tissues examined, namely
brain, spinal cord, liver, pancreas, kidney, spleen, heart, lung,
skeletal muscle, testis, ovary, fetal brain, and fetal liver. Within the
brain, TBCD expression was found in all regions tested, namely amygdala,
corpus callosum, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, substantia
nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and thalamus.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunofluorescence microscopy analysis, Martin et al. (2000)
demonstrated that overexpression of TBCD correlated with microtubule
depolymerization and a progressive loss of microtubules, leading to a
rapid drop in levels of alpha-tubulin (191110) but not beta-tubulin
(TUBB; 191130). The results showed that TBCD modulates microtubule
dynamics by capturing GTP-bound TUBB. The interactions did not lead to
apoptosis.

Using HeLa cells, Tian et al. (2010) showed that binding of TBCD to the
GTPase-activating protein ARL2 (604649) inhibited the
microtubule-depolymerizing effect of overexpressed human TBCD.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (1999) noted that the UniGene database gives chromosome 17
as the map location of the TBCD gene.

Hartz (2013) mapped the TBCD gene to chromosome 17q25.3 based on an
alignment of the TBCD sequence (GenBank GENBANK AJ006417) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

In linkage and association studies of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome
(GTS; 137580), Paschou et al. (2004) reported linkage disequilibrium
results suggesting involvement of the TBCD gene in the disorder.

613593	TITLE *613593 BUTYROPHILIN, SUBFAMILY 3, MEMBER A1; BTN3A1
;;BT3.1;;
BTF5;;
CD277
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The butyrophilin (BTN) genes are a group of major histocompatibility
complex (MHC)-associated genes that encode type I membrane proteins with
2 extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and an intracellular B30.2
(PRYSPRY) domain. Three subfamilies of human BTN genes are located in
the MHC class I region: the single-copy BTN1A1 gene (601610) and the
BTN2 (e.g., BTN2A1; 613590) and BTN3 (e.g., BNT3A1) genes, which have
undergone tandem duplication, resulting in 3 copies of each (summary by
Smith et al., 2010).

CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, RT-PCR of peripheral blood leukocytes and
human cell lines, and 3-prime RACE of a fetal tissue cDNA library,
Rhodes et al. (2001) cloned BTN3A1. They also identified a BTN3A1 splice
variant encoding a truncated protein lacking the B30.2 domain, and this
variant was more abundant than the full-length form.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rhodes et al. (2001) determined that the BTN3A1 gene spans approximately
12 kb and contains 9 coding exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rhodes et al. (2001) mapped the BTN3A1
gene within the BTN gene cluster on chromosome 6p22.1. The BTN gene
cluster is located about 4 Mb telomeric to the classical MHC class I
genes.

612003	TITLE *612003 GRB10-INTERACTING GYF PROTEIN 2; GIGYF2
;;KIAA0642
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a fetal human brain cDNA library for clones containing CAG
repeats, Margolis et al. (1997) cloned GIGYF2, which they called L234.
The longest repeat in GIGYF2 is 9 consecutive CAGs.

By sequencing clones obtained from size-fractionated human brain cDNA
libraries, Ishikawa et al. (1998) cloned GIGYF2, which they designated
KIAA0642. The deduced protein contains 1,069 amino acids. SDS-PAGE
revealed that in vitro-translated GIGYF2 had a molecular mass of more
than 100 kD. RT-PCR showed ubiquitous GIGYF2 expression.

Giovannone et al. (2003) cloned mouse Gigyf2. The deduced 1,292-amino
acid protein contains a GYF domain in its N-terminal half and a clathrin
light chain (see CLTA; 118960) homology domain in its C-terminal half.
It also has a proline-rich region, multiple Q/E stretches, a consensus
bipartite nuclear localization signal, several phosphorylation sites,
and binding sites for protein phosphatase-1 (see PPP1CA; 176875), 14-3-3
proteins (see YWHAB; 601289), and phospholipase C-gamma (see PLCG1;
172420). Northern blot analysis detected highest expression in mouse
heart, liver, and testis, with lower levels in kidney, brain, and lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Giovannone et al. (2003) showed that mouse
Gigyf2 bound Grb10 (601523). Mutation analysis showed that the
interaction required the GYF domain of Gigyf2 and at least 2 of the 3
proline-rich regions in Grb10.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Margolis et al. (1997) mapped the GIGYF2
gene to chromosome 2q21.2. Hartz (2008) mapped the GIGYF2 gene to
chromosome 2q37.1 based on an alignment of the GIGYF2 sequence (GenBank
GENBANK AB014542) with the genomic sequence (build 36.1).

Giovannone et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Gigyf2 gene to chromosome 1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 12 unrelated Italian or French families with
Parkinson disease-11 (PARK11; 607688), Lautier et al. (2008) identified
7 different heterozygous mutations in the GIGYF2 gene (see, e.g.,
612003.0001-612003.0004).

Nichols et al. (2009) did not identify 5 of the 7 GIGYF2 variants
reported by Lautier et al. (2008) among 96 probands with PD linked to
chromosome 2q or in an extended sample of 566 multiplex PD families. One
variant (N56S; 612003.0001) was found in 2 families and showed
incomplete penetrance. Another variant (N457T; 612003.0002) was
demonstrated not to segregate with the disorder in 1 family, raising
doubts about its pathogenicity. Nichols et al. (2009) concluded that
there was no consistent evidence that variation in the GIGYF2 gene
contributes significantly to PD, and suggested that variation in another
gene at this locus accounts for the disorder.

Zimprich et al. (2009) identified the N56S variant in 1 of 669 PD
patients and in 1 of 1,051 control individuals. The patient with PD had
an affected sister, who did not carry the N56S variant. In addition, the
N457T variant was found in 1 patient of Egyptian origin and in 3
controls of European origin, but not in 50 Egyptian controls. The
authors concluded that neither variant plays a major role in the
pathogenesis of PD.

Tan et al. (2009) identified 4 different heterozygous mutations in the
GIGYF2 gene (see, e.g., K421R; 612003.0005) in 7 (1.6%) of 450 patients
with Parkinson disease from Taiwan and Singapore. The mutations were not
identified in 400 controls. One patient had a positive family history,
but the family was too small for segregation analysis. All patients had
typical features of PD, with a mean age of onset ranging from 39 to 67
years. None of the mutations reported by Lautier et al. (2008) were
found. Tan et al. (2009) emphasized that their results should be
interpreted with caution, and that replication studies should be
performed to establish conclusively if the variants are indeed
pathogenic.

ANIMAL MODEL

Giovannone et al. (2009) reported that Gigyf2 -/- mice underwent
apparently normal embryonic development, but died within the first 2
postnatal days. Gigyf2 +/- mice survived to adulthood with no evident
metabolic or growth defects. At 12-15 months of age, the Gigyf2 +/- mice
began to exhibit motor dysfunction manifested as decreased balance time
on a rotating horizontal rod. This was associated with histopathologic
evidence of neurodegeneration and rare intracytoplasmic Lewy body-like
inclusions in spinal anterior horn motor neurons. There were
alpha-synuclein (SNCA; 163890)-positive neuritic plaques in the
brainstem and cerebellum, but no abnormalities in the substantia nigra.
Primary cultured embryo fibroblasts from Gigyf2 -/- mice exhibited
decreased IGF-I (IGF1; 147440)-stimulated receptor tyrosine
phosphorylation and augmented ERK1/2 (see 601795) phosphorylation.
Giovannone et al. (2009) proposed an important role of GIGYF2 in
age-related neurodegeneration and IGF pathway signaling.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PARKINSON DISEASE 11
GIGYF2, ASN56SER

In affected members of 4 unrelated European Caucasian families with
Parkinson disease-11 (607688), Lautier et al. (2008) identified a
heterozygous 167A-G transition in exon 2 of the GIGYF2 gene, resulting
in an asn56-to-ser (N56S) substitution in a highly conserved region.
Disease onset ranged from age 41 to 73 years. There were 2 unaffected
disease carriers, suggesting incomplete penetrance.

Nichols et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous N56S substitution in 1
of 96 probands with familial PD showing linkage to the PARK11 locus on
chromosome 2q. The N56S substitution was also identified in another
proband from an extended sample of 566 multiplex PD families. In 1
family, 2 sisters with PD with onset at ages 58 and 63, respectively,
carried the heterozygous mutation. A deceased parent was reportedly
affected. In the second family, 1 patient with PD carried the mutation,
another patient who reportedly had PD but was not examined, also carried
the mutation, whereas 2 additional family members with PD did not carry
the mutation. Thus, in the second family, the N56S substitution did not
segregate completely with the disorder. The N56S substitution was not
identified in 1,447 controls. Nichols et al. (2009) raised doubts about
the pathogenicity of mutations in the GIGYF2 gene as causative for PD.

Zimprich et al. (2009) identified the N56S variant in 1 of 669 PD
patients and in 1 of 1,051 control individuals. The patient with PD had
an affected sister, who did not carry the N56S variant. The authors
concluded that the N56S variant does not play a major role in the
pathogenesis of PD.

.0002
PARKINSON DISEASE 11
GIGYF2, ASN457THR

In affected members of 3 unrelated European Caucasian families with
Parkinson disease-11 (607688), Lautier et al. (2008) identified a
heterozygous 1370A-C transversion in exon 11 of the GIGYF2 gene,
resulting in an asn457-to-thr (N457T) substitution in a highly conserved
region. Disease onset ranged from 43 to 65 years.

Bras et al. (2009) referred to this mutation as ASN478THR (N478T). In a
complete screening of the GIGYF2 gene in a series of 724 cases and 911
neurologically normal controls from Portuguese and North American
populations, Bras et al. (2009) found 3 previously published mutations,
including N478T, among control individuals. The authors suggested that
mutations in GIGYF2 are not strongly related to the development of the
disease in either of these populations.

Nichols et al. (2009) presented evidence refuting the pathogenicity of
the N457T variant. In 1 family, an 81-year-old unaffected individual was
heterozygous for the substitution, and 3 affected individuals carried
the substitution. Although N457T was not identified in 1,447 controls,
Nichols et al. (2009) concluded that there was no evidence that the
N457T was causative for PD in their family.

Zimprich et al. (2009) identified the N457T variant was found in 1 of
669 PD patients and in 3 of 1,051 controls. The patient of Egyptian
origin, and N457T was not found in 50 Egyptian controls. The authors
concluded that the N457T variant does not play a major role in the
pathogenesis of PD.

.0003
PARKINSON DISEASE 11
GIGYF2, ASP606GLU

In a French mother and son with Parkinson disease-11 (607688), Lautier
et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous 1818C-G transversion in exon 14
of the GIGYF2 gene, resulting in an asp606-to-glu (D606E) substitution
in a highly conserved region. Disease onset was at ages 83 and 42,
respectively. A maternal aunt, who was deceased, was reportedly
affected.

.0004
PARKINSON DISEASE 11
GIGYF2, ILE278VAL

In an Italian father and daughter with Parkinson disease-11 (607688),
Lautier et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous 832A-G transition in
exon 8 of the GIGYF2 gene, resulting in an ile278-to-val (I278V)
substitution in a highly conserved region. Disease onset was at ages 66
and 33, respectively. The daughter, who had onset at age 33, also
inherited a pathogenic mutation in the LRRK2 gene (609007) from her
mother, who also had PD. Lautier et al. (2008) postulated an additive
effect of the 2 mutations.

.0005
PARKINSON DISEASE 11
GIGYF2, LYS421ARG

In 4 (0.9%) of 450 unrelated patients with Parkinson disease (607688)
from Taiwan and Singapore, Tan et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous
1262A-G transition in exon 10 of the GIGYF2 gene, resulting in a
lys421-to-arg (K421R) substitution in a conserved residue. The mutation
was not found in 400 ethnically matched controls. Tan et al. (2009)
emphasized that the results should be interpreted with caution and that
replication studies should be performed to establish conclusively if
this variant is indeed pathogenic.

613299	TITLE *613299 FAMILY WITH SEQUENCE SIMILARITY 13, MEMBER A; FAM13A
;;FAM13A1;;
KIAA0914
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned FAM13A, which they designated
KIAA0914. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its 3-prime
end, and the deduced protein contains 683 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected highest expression of FAM13A in brain and ovary, followed by
lung and kidney. Variable expression was detected in all other tissues
examined.

By EST database analysis and PCR of a human mammary gland cDNA library,
Cohen et al. (2004) cloned 2 splice variants of FAM13A. Variant-1 (V1)
corresponds to KIAA0914 and encodes a protein with 2 coiled-coil domains
and 3 nuclear localization signals. V2 encodes a deduced 1,023-amino
acid protein that has an N-terminal extension containing a RhoGAP (see
602732) domain that is absent in V1. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous expression of the 5-kb V1 transcript, with highest expression
in skeletal muscle, thymus, brain, and lung. The 6-kb V2 transcript was
less abundant and was detected predominantly in kidney, pancreas, liver,
lung, and thymus. Other shorter transcripts were variable expressed.
Fam13a expression was detected in mouse mammary gland, and expression
did not change during mammary gland development and differentiation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cohen et al. (2004) determined that the FAM13A gene contains 25 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the FAM13A
gene to chromosome 4.

By genomic sequence analysis, Cohen et al. (2004) mapped the FAM13A gene
to chromosome 4q22.1. The last exon of the FAM13A gene overlaps the last
exon of the FAM13AOS gene (613300) on the opposite strand.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, see COPD (606963).

103180	TITLE *103180 ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR 1; ARF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), such as ARF1, are small guanine
nucleotide-binding proteins that enhance the enzymatic activities of
cholera toxin. ARFs are essential and ubiquitous in eukaryotes, being
involved in vesicular transport and functioning as activators of
phospholipase D. The functions of ARF proteins in membrane traffic and
organelle integrity are intimately tied to their reversible association
with membranes and specific interactions with membrane phospholipids. A
common feature of these functions is their regulation by the binding and
hydrolysis of GTP (summary by Bobak et al. (1989) and Amor et al.
(1994)).

CLONING

Bobak et al. (1989) cloned 2 ARF cDNAs, ARF1 and ARF3 (103190), from a
human cerebellum library. Based on deduced amino acid sequences and
patterns of hybridization of cDNA and oligonucleotide probes with
mammalian brain poly(A)+ RNA, human ARF1 is the homolog of bovine ARF1.
Human ARF3, however, appeared to represent a newly identified, third
type of ARF, which differs from bovine ARF1 and bovine ARF2. Peng et al.
(1989) also reported cloning of ADP-ribosylation factor.

Lee et al. (1992) found that human ARF1 is identical to its bovine
counterpart, has a distinctive pattern of tissue and developmental
expression, and is encoded by an mRNA of approximately 1.9 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Coatomer, or COPI (see 601924), is a heptameric protein recruited to
membranes by ARF1. Coat assembly helps in the transport of budding off
membrane between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus.
Using fluorescence microscopy, Presley et al. (2002) showed that guanine
nucleotide exchange-activated ARF1 at the Golgi membrane recruits and
binds cytoplasmic COPI to the membranes. Photobleaching experiments
demonstrated that COPI remains at the membranes after ARF1-GTP has been
hydrolyzed by ARFGAP1 (608377). COPI binds to membrane cargo,
soluble-cargo receptors, or other Golgi proteins. Uncoating, or the
release of COPI from Golgi membranes to the cytoplasm, then occurs,
which can be inhibited by aluminum fluoride. Presley et al. (2002)
concluded from their kinetic and biochemical analyses that COPI and ARF1
continuously bind and release from Golgi membranes, allowing the
membrane at these sites to recruit cargo, alter their phospholipid
composition, and become larger, phase-separated domains.

Endocytosis of glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored proteins and
the fluid phase takes place primarily through a dynamin (see DNM1;
602377)- and clathrin (see CLTC; 118955)-independent, CDC42
(116952)-regulated pinocytic mechanism. In Chinese hamster ovary cells,
Kumari and Mayor (2008) found that reduced activity or levels of Arf1
inhibited GPI-anchored protein and fluid-phase endocytosis without
affecting other clathrin-dependent or -independent endocytic pathways.
Arf1 was activated at distinct sites on the plasma membrane, and it
recruited the CDC42 GTPase-activating protein Arhgap10 (609746) to the
plasma membrane, thereby modulating cell surface Cdc42 dynamics. Kumari
and Mayor (2008) concluded that ARF1 regulates both endocytosis and
secretion and may provide a mechanism for crosstalk between these
processes.

Using a yeast genetic screen for substrates of the Shigella flexneri
type III effector protein IpaJ, Burnaevskiy et al. (2013) identified
Arf1 and Arf2 (ARF4; 601177). Mass spectrometric analysis showed that
IpaJ cleaved the peptide bond between myristoylated gly2 and asn3 of
human ARF1. Further analysis showed that IpaJ cleaved numerous
N-myristoylated proteins with various functions. Burnaevskiy et al.
(2013) concluded that IpaJ is a cysteine protease that cleaves the
N-myrisoylated glycine from ARF1, possibly as the substrate cycles
between activity-dependent conformational states. They proposed that
cleavage of lipidated proteins may be a mechanism of microbial
pathogenesis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Amor et al. (1994) described the 3-dimensional structure of full-length
human ARF1 in its GDP-bound nonmyristoylated form.

Mossessova et al. (1998) reported the crystal structure of the catalytic
Sec7 homology domain of ARNO (602488), a human guanine nucleotide
exchange factor (GEF) for ARF1, determined at 2.2-angstrom resolution.
The Sec7 domain is an elongated, all-helical protein with a distinctive
hydrophobic groove that is phylogenetically conserved. Structure-based
mutagenesis identifies the groove and an adjacent conserved loop as the
ARF-interacting surface. The sites of Sec7 domain interaction on ARF1
have subsequently been mapped, by protein footprinting experiments, to
the switch 1 and switch 2 GTPase regions, leading to a model for the
interaction between ARF GTPases and Sec7 domain exchange factors.

Nucleotide dissociation from small G protein-GEF complexes involves
transient GDP-bound intermediates. In the case of ARF proteins, small G
proteins that regulate membrane traffic in eukaryotic cells, such
intermediates can be trapped either by the natural inhibitor brefeldin A
or by charge reversal at the catalytic glutamate of the Sec7 domain of
their GEFs. Renault et al. (2003) reported the crystal structure of
these intermediates, which shows that membrane recruitment of ARF and
nucleotide dissociation are separate reactions stimulated by the Sec7
domain. The reactions proceed through sequential rotations of the
Arf-GDP core towards the Sec7 catalytic site, and are blocked by
interfacial binding of brefeldin A and unproductive stabilization of GDP
by charge reversal.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lee et al. (1992) determined that the ARF1 gene has 4 introns and spans
approximately 16.5 kb. Exon 1 (46 bp) contains only untranslated
sequence. The 5-prime flanking region has a high GC content but no TATA
or CAAT box, as found in housekeeping genes. The authors stated that the
2 human class I ARF genes, ARF1 and ARF3, have similar exon/intron
organizations and use GC-rich promoters.

MAPPING

Hirai et al. (1996) obtained an expressed sequence tag related to the
ARF1 gene and used fluorescence in situ hybridization to assign ARF1 to
1q42.

600285	TITLE *600285 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION TERMINATION FACTOR 1; ETF1
;;RELEASE FACTOR 1; RF1;;
ERF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Termination of protein biosynthesis and release of the nascent
polypeptide chain are signaled by the presence of an in-frame stop codon
at the aminoacyl site of the ribosome. The process of translation
termination is universal and is mediated by protein release factors
(RFs) and GTP. A class 1 RF recognizes the stop codon and promotes the
hydrolysis of the ester bond linking the polypeptide chain with the
peptidyl site tRNA, a reaction catalyzed at the peptidyl transferase
center of the ribosome. Class 2 RFs, which are not codon specific and do
not recognize codons, stimulate class 1 RF activity and confer GTP
dependency upon the process. In prokaryotes, both class 1 RFs, RF1 and
RF2, recognize UAA; however, UAG and UGA are decoded specifically by RF1
and RF2, respectively. In eukaryotes, eRF1, or ETF1, the functional
counterpart of RF1 and RF2, functions as an omnipotent RF, decoding all
3 stop codons (Frolova et al., 1994).

CLONING

Frolova et al. (1994) characterized a family of tightly related proteins
from lower and higher eukaryotes that are structurally and functionally
similar to rabbit RF. Two of these proteins, one from human and the
other from Xenopus laevis, were expressed in yeast and Escherichia coli,
respectively, purified, and shown to be active in the in vitro RF assay.
Another protein of this family, sup45 (sup1) of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, is involved in omnipotent suppression during translation.
The amino acid sequence of the RF1 family is highly conserved. Frolova
et al. (1994) concluded that the RF1 proteins are directly implicated in
the termination of translation in eukaryotes.

GENE FUNCTION

Eukaryotic RF1 and RF3 (see GSPT1; 139259) are involved in translation
termination. In vitro, RF1 catalyzes the release of the polypeptide
chain without any stop codon specificity; the GTP-binding protein RF3
confers GTP dependence to the termination process and stimulates RF1
activity. Le Goff et al. (1997) used tRNA-mediated nonsense suppression
of different stop codons in a CAT reporter gene to analyze the
polypeptide chain release factor activities of recombinant human RF1 and
RF3 proteins overexpressed in human cells. Using a CAT assay, they
measured the competition between the suppressor tRNA and the release
factors when a stop codon was present in the ribosomal A site.
Regardless of which of the 3 stop codons was present in the CAT open
reading frame, the overexpression of RF1 alone markedly decreased
translational read-through by suppressor tRNA. Thus, Le Goff et al.
(1997) concluded that RF1 has intrinsic antisuppressor activity. The
levels of antisuppression when both RF1 and RF3 were overexpressed were
almost the same as those when RF1 was overexpressed alone, suggesting
that RF1-RF3 complex-mediated termination may be controlled by the
expression level of RF1. Overexpression of RF3 alone had an inhibitory
effect on CAT gene expression. CAT mRNA stability studies suggested that
RF3 inhibits gene expression at the transcriptional level. Le Goff et
al. (1997) suggested that RF3 may perform other functions, including the
stimulation of RF1 activity, in vivo.

Alkalaeva et al. (2006) reconstituted eukaryotic translation initiation,
elongation, and termination processes in vitro on a model mRNA encoding
a tetrapeptide followed by a UAA stop codon using individual 40S and 60S
ribosomal subunits and the complete set of individual initiation,
elongation, and release factors. They found that binding of human ERF1
and ERF3A (GSPT1) and GTP to the ribosomal pretermination complex
induced a structural rearrangement characterized by a 2-nucleotide
forward shift of the toeprint attributed to the pretermination complex.
Subsequent GTP hydrolysis was required for rapid hydrolysis of peptidyl
tRNA in the pretermination complex. Cooperativity between ERF1 and ERF3A
in ensuring fast peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis required the ERF3A-binding
C-terminal domain of ERF1.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Song et al. (2000) determined the crystal structure of ETF1 to
2.8-angstrom resolution, which, when combined with mutagenesis analyses
of the universal GGQ motif, revealed the molecular mechanism of RF
activity. The overall shape and dimensions of ETF1 resemble a tRNA
molecule, with domains 1, 2, and 3 of ETF1 corresponding to the
anticodon loop, aminoacyl acceptor stem, and T stem of a tRNA molecule,
respectively. The position of the essential GGQ motif at an exposed tip
of domain 2 suggested to the authors that the gln residue coordinates a
water molecule to mediate the hydrolytic activity at the peptidyl
transferase center. Song et al. (2000) proposed that a conserved groove
on domain 1, 80 angstroms from the GGQ motif, forms the codon
recognition site.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lai et al. (2001) determined that the ETF1 gene contains 10 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hansen et al. (1999) mapped the ETF1 gene
to chromosome 5q31.1. Guenet et al. (2000) confirmed the mapping of the
ETF1 gene to 5q31 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

612184	TITLE *612184 CASK-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; CASKIN1
;;KIAA1306
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human fetal brain
cDNA library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned KIAA1306. The deduced protein
shares 34% sequence identity with KIAA1139 (CASKIN2; 612185). RT-PCR
ELISA detected high or intermediate expression of KIAA1306 in all
tissues tested, with highest expression in fetal and adult brain, lung,
and liver.

By affinity purification of rat brain proteins with a GST fusion protein
of the N-terminal CaM kinase domain of CASK (300172), an adaptor protein
of the plasma membrane, Tabuchi et al. (2002) isolated a novel 180-kD
protein. By database analysis, they identified KIAA1306 (CASKIN1) as the
cDNA encoding this protein, as well as rat and mouse homologs and the
highly related human CASKIN2. The Caskin proteins are highly conserved
evolutionarily. Each has a multidomain architecture in which the N
terminus has 6 ankyrin repeats, a single SH3 domain, and 2 sterile alpha
motif (SAM) domains, and the C terminus contains a long proline-rich
sequence and a short conserved domain. The Caskin1 protein contains
1,432 amino acids. Northern blot analysis of rat tissues detected
brain-specific expression of Caskin1. Immunocytochemistry experiments on
rat brain section revealed that Caskin1 localizes primarily to the
neuropil and is enriched in synaptic areas.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunoprecipitation experiments, Tabuchi et al. (2002) determined
that Caskin1, like Mint1 (602414), is stably bound to CASK in the brain.
Affinity chromatography experiments determined that Caskin1 coassembles
with CASK on the immobilized cytoplasmic tail of neurexin-1 (600565),
suggesting that CASK and Caskin1 coat the cytoplasmic tails of neurexins
and other cell surface proteins. Detailed mapping studies revealed that
Caskin1 and Mint1 bind to the same site on the N-terminal CaM kinase
domain of CASK and compete with each other for CASK binding.
GST-pull-down experiments indicated that CASK forms a tripartite complex
with Caskin1 and Velis (see 603380) similar to the CASK-Mint1-Veli
complex. The Caskin1 sequence that binds to CASK is poorly conserved
between Caskins 1 and 2 and GST-Caskin2 fusion experiments showed that
Caskin2 does not bind to CASK.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CASKIN1
gene to chromosome 16 (TMAP SHGC-61344).

606884	TITLE *606884 RNA-BINDING MOTIF PROTEIN 5; RBM5
;;LUCA15;;
G15
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Timmer et al. (1999) identified a YAC clone corresponding to chromosome
3p21.3 that is deleted in the small cell lung cancer cell line GLC20.
They isolated and cloned RBM5 by direct hybridization of this YAC clone
to a pre-B-cell cDNA library. The deduced 815-amino acid protein
contains 2 RNA-binding motifs, a C2C2-type zinc finger motif, a
C2H2-type zinc finger motif, and a bipartite nuclear signal. The same
functional motifs are found in RBM6 (606886), as has also been reported
by Gure et al. (1998), and the 2 proteins share 30% amino acid identity.
Northern blot analysis of multiple tissues detected expression of 7.4-
and 3.5-kb transcripts in all tissues investigated. Although the RBM5
gene is located in a region considered critical for the development of
lung cancer, Northern and Southern analyses of a number of lung cancer
cell lines revealed no patterns of aberrant RBM5 expression.

By physical cloning methodologies and bioinformatic computational
analyses, Lerman and Minna (2000) identified a number of genes,
including RBM5, which they called G15, in a region of chromosome 3p21.3
that is associated with a putative lung cancer tumor suppressor gene.
The mouse ortholog is 97% identical on the protein level. Northern blot
analysis detected wide expression in normal and lung cancer tissues and
cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Drabkin et al. (1999) found that recombinant proteins containing the RNA
recognition motifs of RBM5 or RBM6 specifically bind poly(G) RNA
homopolymers in vitro.

Lerman and Minna (2000) identified no mutations in the RBM5 gene in lung
cancer cell lines. They concluded that RBM5 is an unlikely candidate as
a tumor suppressor gene.

Oh et al. (2002) found that the RBM5 gene, which they called H37, showed
reduced expression in 9 of 11 primary nonsmall cell lung cancers when
compared with adjacent normal bronchial cells. Introduction of H37 cDNA
into human breast cancer cells with deletion of 3p22-p21 reduced both
anchorage-dependent and -independent cell growth in vitro. They
concluded that H37 may have a role as a tumor suppressor gene in human
lung cancer.

GENE STRUCTURE

Timmer et al. (1999) determined that the RBM5 gene contains 25 exons. By
genomic sequence analysis, Lerman and Minna (2000) detected only 18
exons in the 18.5-kb RBM5 gene.

MAPPING

Timmer et al. (1999) identified the RBM5 gene within a YAC clone
corresponding to chromosome 3p21.3.

609433	TITLE *609433 UBIQUITIN INTERACTION MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; UIMC1
;;RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 80-KD; RAP80
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display of RNA expressed by young proliferating and
senescent normal human epidermal keratinocytes, followed by screening a
testis cDNA library, Yan et al. (2002) cloned RAP80. The deduced
719-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 79.6 kD. The
N-terminal half of RAP80 contains 2 nuclear localization signals and a
putative ubiquitin interaction motif. The C-terminal half contains a
potential PEST sequence, 2 zinc fingers, and a third nuclear
localization signal. Northern blot analysis detected a major 2.6-kb
transcript expressed highly in testis and moderately in ovary, thymus,
and heart. In situ hybridization of mouse testis detected Rap80
associated with germ cells, with little expression in surrounding Leydig
cells. No significant differences in the level of Rap80 were found
between developmental subpopulations of germ cells, suggesting that
Rap80 expression is not developmentally regulated. Immunofluorescence
localization detected RAP80 in a speckled nuclear distribution in a
transfected monkey kidney cell line, and mutation analysis indicated
that the second nuclear localization signal directed intracellular
localization.

GENE FUNCTION

Yan et al. (2002) found that RAP80 decreased basal transcription of a
reporter gene in transfected Chinese hamster ovary and monkey kidney
cell lines. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis indicated that RAP80 could interact
with the retinoid-related testis-associated receptor (RTR; 602778), but
not with retinoid receptors (see RXRA; 180245) or other nuclear
receptors tested. Cotransfection experiments showed that RAP80 and RTR
interacted with each other in a dose-dependent manner. Mutation analysis
indicated that several regions of RAP80 were important for optimal
interaction with RTR. RAP80 inhibited the interaction of NCOR (600849)
with RTR in a concentration-dependent manner, and RAP80 and NCOR
appeared to compete with each other for RTR binding.

Wang et al. (2007) showed that Abraxas (ABRA1; 611143), a protein that
binds BRCA1 (113705), recruits the ubiquitin-interacting motif
(UIM)-containing protein RAP80 to the BRCA1 complex. Both Abraxas and
RAP80 were required for DNA damage resistance, G2/M checkpoint control,
and DNA repair. RAP80 was required for optimal accumulation of BRCA1 on
damaged DNA (foci) in response to ionizing radiation, and the UIM
domains alone were capable of foci formation. Wang et al. (2007)
concluded that the RAP80-Abraxas complex may help recruit BRCA1 to DNA
damage sites in part through recognition of ubiquitinated proteins.

Sobhian et al. (2007) reported the interaction of the BRCT (BRCA1
C-terminal) BRCA1 domain with the ubiquitin-binding protein RAP80. RAP80
targets a complex containing the BRCA1-BARD1 (601593) E3 ligase and the
deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC36 (300617) to MDC1 (607593)-gamma-H2AX
(601772)-dependent lys6- and lys63-linked ubiquitin polymers at
double-strand breaks. Sobhian et al. (2007) stated that these events are
required for cell cycle checkpoint and repair responses to ionizing
radiation, implicating ubiquitin chain recognition and turnover in the
BRCA1-mediated repair of double-strand breaks.

Kim et al. (2007) independently reported the identification of AP80 as a
BRCA1-interacting protein in humans. RAP80 contains a tandem UIM domain,
which is required for its binding with ubiquitin in vitro and its
damage-induced foci formation in vivo. Moreover, Kim et al. (2007)
showed that RAP80 specifically recruits BRCA1 to DNA damage sites and
functions with BRCA1 in G2/M checkpoint control. Kim et al. (2007)
concluded that taken together, their results suggested the existence of
a ubiquitination-dependent signaling pathway involved in the DNA damage
response.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yan et al. (2002) determined that the RAP80 gene contains 15 exons and
spans more than 90 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Yan et al. (2002) mapped the UIMC1 gene to chromosome 5q35.

607335	TITLE *607335 BESTROPHIN 2; BEST2
;;VMD2-LIKE GENE 1; VMD2L1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BEST2 belongs to the bestrophin family of anion channels, which includes
BEST1 (607854), the gene mutant in vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD;
153700), and 2 other BEST1-like genes, BEST3 (607337) and BEST4
(607336). Bestrophins are transmembrane (TM) proteins that share a
homology region containing a high content of aromatic residues,
including an invariant arg-phe-pro (RFP) motif. The bestrophin genes
share a conserved gene structure, with almost identical sizes of the 8
RFP-TM domain-encoding exons and highly conserved exon-intron
boundaries. Each of the 4 bestrophin genes has a unique 3-prime end of
variable length (Stohr et al., 2002; Tsunenari et al., 2003).

CLONING

By BLAST searches in the human genome draft sequence using the cDNA of
the VMD2 gene, Stohr et al. (2002) identified a homologous region on
chromosome 19. By applying an EST assembly strategy and sequencing the
corresponding cDNA clones, they determined the cDNA sequence of the
VMD2L1 gene. The open reading frame encodes a putative 509-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular weight of 57.1 kD. The transcription
of the gene was mainly confined to the retinal pigment epithelium and
colon. The VMD2 gene product has been localized to the basolateral
membrane of the retinal pigment epithelium (Marmorstein et al., 2000).
Stohr et al. (2002) noted that it is conceivable that other RFP-TM
proteins may exert functions in cells with a polarized phenotype,
possibly as receptors involved in a vectorially oriented transport of
molecules.

By RT-PCR, Pifferi et al. (2006) detected only Best2, and no other
bestrophin in mouse olfactory epithelium. Single-cell RT-PCR showed
Best2 expression in olfactory sensory neurons but not in supporting
cells. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Best2 was expressed on
the cilia of olfactory sensory neurons, the site of olfactory
transduction, and that Best2 colocalized with Cnga2 (300338).

GENE FUNCTION

Using electrophysiologic recordings, Pifferi et al. (2006) found that
native channels in cilia of mouse olfactory sensory neurons and in
Best2-transfected human embryonic kidney cells showed the same anion
permeability sequence, single-channel conductance, similar Ca(2+)
sensitivity, and the same side-specific channel blockade with 2 chloride
channel blockers. Pifferi et al. (2006) concluded that BEST2 is a
molecular component of the olfactory calcium-activated chloride channel.

GENE STRUCTURE

Stohr et al. (2002) noted that the BEST2 gene covers 5.9 kb of genomic
DNA.

MAPPING

By FISH to human metaphase spreads, Stohr et al. (2002) refined the
localization of BEST2 to chromosome 19p13.2-p13.12.

614720	TITLE *614720 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 19; CDK19
;;KIAA1028
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned CDK19, which they designated
KIAA1028. The transcript contains repetitive elements in its 3-prime
end, and the deduced 375-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with CDK8 (603184). RT-PCR ELISA detected variable CDK19
expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific adult brain
regions examined. Highest expression was in corpus callosum, followed by
kidney and ovary.

Mukhopadhyay et al. (2010) observed CDK19 expression in a wide variety
of human tissues, with high expression in fetal brain and retina.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Kikuno et al. (1999) mapped the CDK19 gene
to chromosome 6.

Hartz (2012) mapped the CDK19 gene to chromosome 6q21 based on an
alignment of the CDK19 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB028951) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

CYTOGENETICS

In a 41-year-old woman with microcephaly, mental retardation, retinal
folds, and lymphedema (see 152950), Mukhopadhyay et al. (2010)
identified a pericentric inversion in chromosome 6 involving 6p11.1 and
6q21 that disrupted the CDK19 gene, resulting in haploinsufficiency
(patient transcript level 54% compared to control). No other large copy
number abnormalities were identified on comparative genomic
hybridization. The patient had microcephaly at birth, and head
circumference remained far below the P10 curve on subsequent
examinations. She had cafe-au-lait-like pigmentations scattered over her
body, but no other features consistent with neurofibromatosis (see
162200). Moderate psychomotor retardation and hearing loss were
diagnosed in infancy. Ophthalmologic evaluation at 2 years of age
revealed horizontal nystagmus; funduscopy revealed bilateral falciform
retinal folds running from the optic nerve head to the temporal
periphery. Both folds were attached by white fibrous tissue to the pars
plana and temporal equator of the lens. At age 14 years, visual acuity
bilaterally was limited to finger counting. Eye examination of the
parents showed no significant abnormalities. The patient was also found
to have night blindness and lymphedema; at 41 years of age she developed
type 2 diabetes (125853), which was treated with diet and oral
medication. Mukhopadhyay et al. (2010) concluded that the syndrome of
microcephaly, congenital retinal fold, and mild mental retardation in
their patient was likely caused by CDK19 haploinsufficiency. Analysis of
the CDK19 gene in 9 additional patients with similar features revealed

;;WILLIAMS-BEUREN SYNDROME CHROMOSOME REGION 24; WBSCR24
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a database for sequences homologous to yeast Vps37,
Stuchell et al. (2004) identified human VPS37D. The deduced 316-amino
acid protein has a central mod(r) (modifier of rudimentary) domain
containing 2 coiled-coil motifs.

By searching EST databases for sequences mapping to the region of
chromosome 7 deleted in Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; 194050), Micale
et al. (2008) identified and cloned VPS37D, which they called WBSCR24.
They also identified the mouse Wbscr24 gene. Northern blot analysis
detected several variants of mouse Wbscr24 that were widely expressed in
a tissue-specific manner. Expression of Wbscr24 was highest in brain,
kidney, and skeletal muscle.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Micale et al. (2008) mapped the VPS37D
gene to chromosome 7q11.23 within the interval deleted in WBS. They
mapped the mouse Vps37D gene to a syntenic region of chromosome 5G1.

607212	TITLE *607212 CASPASE RECRUITMENT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 9; CARD9
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The caspase recruitment domain (CARD) is a protein module that consists
of 6 or 7 antiparallel alpha helices. It participates in apoptosis
signaling through highly specific protein-protein homophilic
interactions. CARDs induce nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; 164011)
activity through the IKK (e.g., IKBKB; 603258) complex. CARD9, CARD10
(607209), CARD11 (607210), and CARD14 (607211) interact with BCL10
(603517) and are involved in NFKB signaling complexes. However, unlike
CARD10, CARD11, and CARD14, CARD9 does not contain C-terminal
membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) domains (summary by Bertin
et al., 2000, 2001).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences containing CARD domains,
Bertin et al. (2000) identified a cDNA encoding CARD9. The deduced
536-amino acid protein, which is 88% identical to the rat protein,
contains an N-terminal CARD domain and a central coiled-coil domain.
Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 2.1-kb transcript in
spleen, liver, placenta, lung, peripheral blood leukocytes, and brain,
as well as in the HL60 cancer cell line.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mammalian 2-hybrid analysis, Bertin et al. (2000) showed that
CARD9 selectively interacts with the CARD domain of BCL10 and also
associates with itself, suggesting that oligomerization may play a role
in protein function. Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analyses
demonstrated that the 70-kD CARD9 protein is associated with the 40-kD
BCL10 protein in a macrophage cell line. Fluorescence microscopy
revealed a punctate cytoplasmic expression, some of which colocalized
with BCL10 filaments. Luciferase reporter analysis showed that the CARD
domain of CARD9, but not the coiled-coil domain, is required for BCL10
interaction and modest activation of NFKB.

Gross et al. (2006) identified CARD9 as a key transducer of dectin-1
(606264) signaling. Although dispensable for TLR/MyD88 (602170)-induced
responses, CARD9 controls dectin-1-mediated myeloid cell activation,
cytokine production, and innate antifungal immunity. CARD9 couples to
BCL10 and regulates BCL10-MALT1 (604860)-mediated NFKB activation
induced by zymosan, a major yeast cell wall component. Yet, CARD9 is
dispensable for antigen receptor signaling that uses CARMA1 (607210) as
a link to BCL10-MALT1. Thus, Gross et al. (2006) concluded that their
results define a novel innate immune pathway and indicate that
evolutionarily distinct ITAM receptors in innate and adaptive immune
cells use diverse adaptor proteins to engage selectively the conserved
BCL10-MALT1 module.

Hsu et al. (2007) found that expression of CARD9 with NOD2 (605956) in
human embryonic kidney cells resulted in physical association of the
proteins and synergistic activation of p38 (MAPK14; 600289) and JNK
(MAPK8; 601158). Activation of p38 and JNK required the coiled-coil
domain of CARD9, and the interaction between CARD9 and NOD2 was enhanced
in the presence of RICK (RIPK2; 603455).

Yang et al. (2007) showed that VHL (608537) downregulates NF-kappa-B
activity by acting as an adaptor to promote casein kinase-2 (see
115440)-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation of CARD9, an NF-kappa-B
agonist.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large consanguineous Iranian family segregating autosomal recessive
chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis mapping to chromosome 9 (CANDF2;
212050), Glocker et al. (2009) analyzed the candidate gene CARD9 and
identified homozygosity for a nonsense mutation (Q295X; 607212.0001) in
affected individuals. Functional studies showed that Q295X impairs
innate signaling from the antifungal pattern-recognition receptor
dectin-1 (CLEC7A; 606264).

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
CARD9 gene and protection against Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis,
see 266600.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hsu et al. (2007) found that Card9-deficient mice had no obvious
anatomic defects. However, mutant macrophages were defective in
activation of p38 and Jnk, but not of Nfkb, after bacterial and viral
infection. Mice lacking Card9 failed to clear the intracellular pathogen
Listeria monocytogenes after intravenous infection. Early after
infection, they had undetectable serum Tnf (191160) and Il6 (147570),
but high levels of these cytokines were detected late in infection.
Circulating Ifng (147570) was comparable to that in wildtype mice. Hsu
et al. (2007) concluded that CARD9 has a critical function in
NOD2-mediated activation of p38 and JNK in innate immune responses to
intracellular pathogens.

CANDIDIASIS, FAMILIAL, 2
CARD9, GLN295TER

In 4 affected members of a large consanguineous Iranian family
segregating autosomal recessive chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis
mapping to chromosome 9 (CANDF2; 212050), Glocker et al. (2009)
identified homozygosity for a C-to-T transition in exon 6 of the CARD9
gene, resulting in a gln295-to-ter (Q295X) substitution. Eighteen other
unaffected family members were either heterozygous or did not carry the
Q295X mutation, and the mutation was not found in 50 unrelated Iranian
controls or in 180 unrelated Caucasian controls. Functional studies
based on genetic reconstitution of myeloid cells from Card9 -/- mice
demonstrated that Q295X is a loss-of-function mutation that impairs
innate signaling from the antifungal pattern-recognition receptor
dectin-1 (CLEC7A; 606264).

145505	TITLE *145505 ACYL-CoA SYNTHETASE MEDIUM CHAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 3; ACSM3
;;SA, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; SA; SAH
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fatty acids are incorporated into membranes and signaling molecules and
have roles in energy storage and metabolism. These essential functions
require activation of the fatty acid by acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)
synthetases, such as ACSM3, which form an activating thioester linkage
between the fatty acid and CoA (Watkins et al., 2007).

CLONING

Iwai and Inagami (1991) identified an mRNA species that showed markedly
higher expression in kidneys of spontaneously hypertensive rats than in
those of normotensive rats. Furthermore, the rat gene encoding this
mRNA, symbolized Sa, was shown to cosegregate with hypertension.

Iwai et al. (1994) found that the deduced amino acid sequence from the
isolated human SAH cDNA consists of 578 amino acids. Human SAH has
slight homology to bacterial acetyl-CoA synthase.

Using Northern blot analysis, Samani et al. (1994) demonstrated that the
SAH gene was expressed in human kidney.

By using mouse Sa to query a human database, Fujino et al. (2001)
identified ACSM3, which they called SA. The deduced 578-amino acid
protein has an N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal. Northern
blot analysis of mouse tissues detected Sa expression in liver and
kidney only. Subcellular fractionation and extraction of mouse kidney
homogenates revealed that Sa localized to mitochondrial matrix.

By searching databases for sequences containing acyl-CoA synthetase
motifs 1 and 2, Watkins et al. (2007) identified a splice variant of
human ACSM3. The full-length 586-amino acid ACSM3 protein contains 4 of
5 motifs characteristic of acyl-CoA synthetases. However, the deduced
438-amino acid isoform lacks motif 2 of the full-length protein,
suggesting that it may not function as an acyl-CoA synthetase.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that ACSM3 belongs to a family of medium
chain acyl-CoA synthetases.

GENE STRUCTURE

Watkins et al. (2007) determined that the ACSM3 gene contains 14 exons.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Szpirer et al. (1993)
assigned the human SAH gene to chromosome 16. On the other hand,
Lindpaintner et al. (1993) pointed out that the human 11p15.5 region is
syntenic with the rat chromosome 1 linkage group that includes the Sa
gene. Samani et al. (1994) mapped the human SAH gene to chromosome
16p13.11 by FISH and somatic cell hybrid analysis. Fujino et al. (2001)
reported that the ACSM3 and ACSM1 (614357) genes are located within 150
kb of one another and are transcribed in opposite directions.

Iwai and Inagami (1991) showed that the rat Sa gene cosegregated with
hypertension and belonged to a linkage group previously assigned to
chromosome 1. Szpirer et al. (1993) independently assigned the Sa gene
to rat chromosome 1.

GENE FUNCTION

Fujino et al. (2001) showed that mouse Sa expressed in COS-7 cells
preferred isobutyrate among fatty acids with 4 to 16 carbon atoms. Sa
required ATP and CoA for activity. Radiolabeled carbon in isobutyrate
was found in CO2, indicating that the fatty acid was degraded by
oxidation. Fujino et al. (2001) concluded that the major function of SA
is to produce acyl-CoA for oxidation in the mitochondrial matrix.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using the restriction enzyme PstI, Iwai et al. (1994) found a RFLP in
the SAH gene and compared allele frequencies between hypertensive and
control groups. The hypertensive group consisted of 89 persons, and the
PstI rare allele (allele A2) frequency in this group was 0.270. The
control group consisted of 81 healthy normotensive persons, among whom
the A2 allele frequency was 0.09. The differences were significant at
the P = 0.0001 level.

;;METHIONINE tRNA SYNTHETASE, MITOCHONDRIAL;;
MITOCHONDRIAL METRS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using primers designed from EST sequences, Spencer et al. (2004)
amplified the human mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA synthetase (mtMetRS)
gene (MARS2) from HL-60 cDNA. The gene encodes a deduced 593-amino acid
protein with an 18-amino acid mitochondrial import signal sequence. The
protein shares a high degree of identity with methionyl-tRNA synthetases
from other mammals, but is less well conserved with the corresponding
enzymes of lower eukaryotes and does not share considerable sequence
similarity to the human cytoplasmic MetRS. The human mtMetRS protein and
the E. coli homolog share 19% sequence identity. The domain organization
of human mtMetRS closely resembles that of the S. cerevisiae and C.
albicans mitochondrial MetRSs. Human mtMetRS contains the signature
sequences HIGH and KMSKS that are present in all class I synthetases as
well as many of the residues that have been proposed to contribute to a
universal core in MetRS of all organisms. Unlike many MetRSs, however,
it has no zinc-binding site and lacks a C-terminal extension thought to
be important in dimerization. Gel filtration studies indicated that
human mtMetRS functions as a monomer with an apparent molecular mass of
67 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a recombinant human enzyme affinity-purified from E. coli, Spencer
et al. (2004) determined the kinetic parameters for mtMetRS
aminoacylation. Like several of the characterized mitochondrial
aminoacyl RSs, human mtMetRS can aminoacylate the heterologous E. coli
tRNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bonnefond et al. (2005) determined that MARS2 is a single-exon gene and
spans 1.8 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MARS2
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP SHGC-52872).

DESCRIPTION The tenascins are a family of extracellular matrix proteins (ECMs); see
187380. The first member, termed tenascin or hexabrachion (TNC; 187380),
attracted attention because of its prominent expression during tissue
interactions in embryogenesis and its overexpression in many tumors.

CLONING

By screening a fetal adrenal cDNA library with a CYP21 (613815) probe,
Morel et al. (1989) obtained a partial cDNA corresponding to a gene on
the opposite strand of CYP21. Northern blot analysis revealed expression
of 3.5- and 1.8-kb transcripts in adult adrenal and a Leydig cell
adenoma. Xu and Doolittle (1990) determined that tenascin and the gene
product identified by Morel et al. (1989) have the same type of
fibronectin (135600) repeats. Gitelman et al. (1992) determined that the
functional gene, which they termed XB, is localized opposite CYP21B and
not the pseudogene CYP21A.

Matsumoto et al. (1992) also identified a tenascin-like gene in the
human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region.
Chromosome walking and sequencing in the region centromeric of CYP21
disclosed a cluster of fibronectin type III repeats. Such repeats
consist of approximately 90 amino acids and exist in a wide range of
protein species. Homology searches in protein databases showed that the
repeats had the highest homology with those of human tenascin.

By screening genomic libraries and multiple cDNA libraries, RT-PCR, and
5-prime RACE, Bristow et al. (1993) cloned the XB gene. Sequence
analysis of the estimated 3,816-amino acid XB gene product, which the
authors termed TNX, predicted the presence of 5 N-linked glycosylation
sites and multiple EFG and fibronectin type III repeats. RNase
protection analysis detected variable expression in all tissues tested,
with highest levels in fetal testis and fetal smooth, striated, and
cardiac muscle. In situ hybridization demonstrated homogeneous
expression of TNX in adult adrenal cortex.

Matsumoto et al. (1994) isolated a cDNA encoding mouse Tnx. They found
that the subunit molecular size of Tnx is approximately 500 kD,
suggesting that the protein may contain up to 40 fibronectin type III
repeats, making it the largest tenascin family member. The Tnx mRNA and
protein were predominantly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, but
low levels of the mRNA were found in most tissues. Immunostaining showed
that the Tnx protein is associated with the extracellular matrix of the
muscle tissues and with blood vessels in all tissues analyzed. Although
the gene lies in the MHC class III region, it is not expressed in
lymphoid organs, except for the staining around blood vessels.

Tee et al. (1995) stated that in the compact region of the human class
III major histocompatibility locus on 6p21.3, genes for C4A (120810),
C4B (120820), and steroid 21-hydroxylase occur in 1 transcriptional
orientation, whereas the TNX gene overlaps the last exon of the CYP21
gene on the opposite strand of DNA in the opposite transcriptional
orientation. This complex locus is duplicated into A and B loci, so that
the orientation is 5-prime-C4A-21A-TNXA-C4B-21B-TNXB-3-prime. Although a
duplication event truncated the 65-kb TNXB gene to a 4.5-kb TNXA gene,
the TNXA gene is transcriptionally active in the adrenal cortex. To
examine the basis of the tissue-specific expression of TNXA and C4B, Tee
et al. (1995) cloned the 1763-bp region that lies between the cap sites
for TNXA and C4B and analyzed its promoter activity in both the TNXA and
the C4 orientations. Transcriptionally active, liver-specific sequences
lie within the first 75 to 138 bp from the C4B cap site, and weaker
transcriptional elements lie within 128 bp of the TNXA cap site that
function in both liver and adrenal cells. Because these elements 128 bp
upstream from the TNXA cap site are perfectly preserved in the TNXB
gene, Tee et al. (1995) sought to determine whether a transcript similar
to TNXA arises within the TNXB gene. RNase protection assays, cDNA
cloning, and RT-PCR showed that adrenal cells contain a novel
transcript, termed short XB (XB-S) by them, which has the same open
reading frame as the gene encoding tenascin-XA. Cell-free translation
and immunoblotting showed that this transcript encodes a novel 74-kD
XB-S protein that is identical to the C-terminal 673 residues of
tenascin-X. Because this protein consists solely of fibronectin type III
repeats and a fibrinogen-like domain, it appears to correspond to an
evolutionary precursor of the tenascin family of extracellular matrix
proteins.

Speek et al. (1996) identified a TNX promoter specific for transcription
in fetal adrenal and muscle tissue, as well as 2 promoters further
upstream specific for transcription in adrenocortical carcinoma cells.
Unlike TNC and TNR (601995), no alternative splicing in the
fibronectin-like domains could be detected by 5-prime RACE and RNase
protection analysis.

Ikuta et al. (1998) determined that the mouse and human TNX proteins are
73% identical. Mouse Tnx has an N-terminal domain containing cysteine
residues and 4 heptad repeats, followed by 18.5 EGF repeats, 31
fibronectin III repeats, and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like motif. Ikuta
et al. (1998) established that the human TNX protein contains 4,267
amino acids and has 33 fibronectin III repeats.

GENE STRUCTURE

By sequencing phage and cosmid clones and cDNA fragments, Bristow et al.
(1993) estimated that the TNX gene contains at least 39 exons and spans
65 kb. Speek et al. (1996) identified an additional exon 10 kb upstream
from the previously known exons. They noted that the TNX gene appears to
be unique in having both its 5-prime and 3-prime ends buried in other
genes.

In a comparative analysis of the mouse Tnx gene and the human TNX gene,
Ikuta et al. (1998) determined that mouse and human introns 1, 4, and 6
are highly conserved. The mouse Tnx gene has 43 exons.

MAPPING

Tee et al. (1995) stated that in the compact region of the human class
III major histocompatibility locus on 6p21.3, genes for C4 and steroid
21-hydroxylase occur in 1 transcriptional orientation, while the TNX
gene overlaps the last exon of the CYP21 gene on the opposite strand of
DNA in the opposite transcriptional orientation. This complex locus is
duplicated into A and B loci, so that the orientation is
5-prime-C4A-21A-TNXA-C4B-21B-TNXB-3-prime.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Burch et al. (1996) described a 25-year-old male with congenital adrenal
hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, associated with an
Ehlers-Danlos type II (130010)-like phenotype (consisting of
hyperextensible skin and joints, patellar chondromalacia, and easy
bruising; see 606408). The patient was studied for a possible contiguous
gene syndrome inasmuch as the TNX gene is encoded by a gene overlapping
the opposite strand of the 21-hydroxylase B gene, CYP21. Western
blotting of heparin-Sepharose concentrated fibroblast-conditioned medium
with anti-human TNX antiserum showed no TNX in samples from the proband
and reduced amounts of TNX in conditioned medium from both parents
compared to controls. A 30-kb deletion (600985.0001) was found in the
proband and his father resulting in loss of the CYP21 gene and creation
of a hybrid gene between TNX and the partially duplicated TNX gene
(called XA by them) with early termination of TNX translation. The
nature of the molecular lesion in the proband's second TNX and CYP21
alleles was unknown. Burch et al. (1996) concluded that the patient's
Ehlers-Danlos phenotype was due to loss of TNX and represented the first
tenascin-related disease.

In their full report, Burch et al. (1997) stated that atypical
histologic findings suggested a novel mechanism of disease in their
proband: the most striking findings were abnormal elastin (130160)
bodies beneath the dermal-epidermal junction, a diffuse increase in
perivascular matrix, and uneven packing of the myelin sheaths of
peripheral nerves. TNX is a 100-kb gene overlapping the 3-prime
untranslated region of the CYP21B gene. The truncated XA gene is a
partially duplicated TNX that occurred in the primordial duplication
event involving this region of 6p. XA and TNX are at least 99%
identical, but XA is transcribed solely in the adrenal gland and
contains a 121-bp deletion that prematurely closes the reading frame
that corresponds to TNX. Since the coding regions of TNX and CYP21B do
not overlap, single point mutations are unlikely to disrupt the function
of both genes. Homologous recombination frequently produces deletion of
the CYP21B locus, but no deletion extending into TNX had been described.
However, recombination between the 5-prime end of XA and the homologous
point in TNX would delete CYP21B and create a TNX/XA fusion gene that
carries the internal deletion normally found in XA, thereby truncating
the TNX open reading frame. Erickson (1997) pointed out that, unlike the
tenascin gene knockout mice, which showed no obvious defect in
connective tissue or in wound healing (Saga et al., 1992), the human
'experiment of nature' indicates a vital role for TNX.

To investigate the role of tenascins in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
Schalkwijk et al. (2001) screened serum samples from 151 patients with
the classic (see 130000), hypermobility (130020), or vascular (130050)
types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome for the presence of tenascin-X and
tenascin-C by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The same assays were
done in 75 patients with psoriasis, 93 patients with rheumatoid
arthritis, and 21 healthy persons. In all subjects the authors examined
the expression of tenascins and type V collagen in skin by
immunohistochemical methods, and the TNX gene was sequenced. Absence of
tenascin-X from the serum was found in 5 unrelated patients, all of whom
had Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Expression of tenascin-C and type V collagen
was normal in these 5 patients. All 5 had hypermobile joints,
hyperelastic skin, and easy bruising, without atrophic scarring. The
authors identified mutations in the TNX gene in all 5 of these patients:
1 had a homozygous deletion, 1 was heterozygous for the same deletion,
and 3 others were homozygous for truncating point mutations, confirming
a causative role for tenascin-X in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and a
recessive pattern of inheritance. None of the parents of the 5 patients
with tenascin-X deficiency were related, and none of the 4 parents
available for study had clinical signs of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

The gene for steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the adjacent complement
C4 gene, and parts of the flanking genes serine/threonine protein
kinase-19 (STK19; 604977) and TNXB constitute a tandemly duplicated
arrangement. Koppens et al. (2002) determined that apparent large-scale
gene conversions accounted for the defect in 9 of 77 chromosomes in a
group of patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid
21-hydroxylase deficiency. They further showed that 4 of 9 'conversions'
extended into TNXB. This implies that approximately 1 in every 10
steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency patients is a carrier of tenascin-X
deficiency.

Zweers et al. (2003) demonstrated that haploinsufficiency of the TNXB
gene, caused by heterozygosity for a 30-kb deletion (600985.0001),
results in the hypermobility type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

For discussion of an association between variation in the TNXB gene and
systemic lupus erythematosus, see SLE (152700).

ANIMAL MODEL

Because TNXB is the first Ehlers-Danlos syndrome gene that does not
encode a fibrillar collagen or collagen-modifying enzyme, Mao and
Bristow (2001) suggested that tenascin-X may regulate collagen synthesis
or deposition. To test this hypothesis, Mao et al. (2002) inactivated
Tnxb in mice. Tnxb -/- mice showed progressive skin hyperextensibility,
similar to that of individuals with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
Biomechanical testing confirmed increased deformability and reduced
tensile strength of their skin. The skin of Tnxb -/- mice was
histologically normal, but its collagen content was significantly
reduced. At the ultrastructural level, collagen fibrils of Tnxb -/- mice
were of normal size and shape, but the density of fibrils in their skin
was reduced, commensurate with the reduction in collagen content.
Studies of cultured dermal fibroblasts showed that although synthesis of
collagen I by Tnxb -/- and wildtype cells was similar, Tnxb -/-
fibroblasts failed to deposit collagen I into cell-associated matrix.
This study confirmed a causative role for TNXB in human Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome and suggested that tenascin-X is an essential regulator of
collagen deposition by dermal fibroblasts.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
EHLERS-DANLOS-LIKE SYNDROME DUE TO TENASCIN-X DEFICIENCY
EHLERS-DANLOS SYNDROME, HYPERMOBILITY TYPE, INCLUDED
TNXB, 30-KB DEL

Burch et al. (1996, 1997) described a patient with Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome (606408) combined with congenital adrenal hyperplasia resulting
from a 30-kb deletion in 6p21.3, which removed the functional
21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21; 613815) and produced partial duplication of
the TNX gene, resulting in a nonfunctional fusion gene. The patient
described by Burch et al. (1996, 1997) was referred to as the index
patient by Schalkwijk et al. (2001) and was heterozygous for the 30-kb
deletion. Patient 3 of a series of 5 patients with Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome identified by Schalkwijk et al. (2001) was homozygous for this
deletion, which explained both the presence of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Both her parents and 2 sibs were
heterozygous for the deletion and were clinically normal, providing
evidence of recessive inheritance in this family. Patient 2 of
Schalkwijk et al. (2001) was heterozygous for the 30-kb deletion and did
not have congenital adrenal hyperplasia. They were unable to identify a
second TNX mutation in patient 2 and suggested that this patient, like
the index patient (Burch et al., 1997), may have had a mutation in
factors, not yet defined, that regulate the tenascin-X gene expression.

Zweers et al. (2003) demonstrated that haploinsufficiency of TNXB
resulting from heterozygosity for the 30-kb deletion results in the
hypermobility form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS III; 130020). They
measured serum TNX levels by ELISA in an unselected cohort of 80
patients with EDS III who were recruited through a Dutch organization
for EDS patients. In all patients, the diagnosis of EDS III was made by
a medical specialist, and approximately 90% were female. In 6 of these
patients (7.5%), all female, serum TNX levels were more than 2.5 S.D.
below the mean for unaffected individuals. Clinically, patients with
reduced TNX levels showed hypermobile joints, often associated with
joint subluxations and chronic musculoskeletal pain. Patients with
haploinsufficiency did not have skin hyperextensibility and lacked the
easy bruising seen in patients with complete TNX deficiency. In
addition, TNXB haploinsufficiency was autosomal dominant. Zweers et al.
(2003) found that 1 of these 6 patients had the 30-kb deletion, which
created a fusion gene of TNXB and XA, a partial duplicate of TNXB. The
XA gene has an internal deletion that truncates its open reading frame,
rendering it and the fusion gene nonfunctional (Gitelman et al., 1992).
The deleted allele also lacked CYP21 (613815).

.0002
EHLERS-DANLOS-LIKE SYNDROME DUE TO TENASCIN-X DEFICIENCY
EHLERS-DANLOS SYNDROME, HYPERMOBILITY TYPE, INCLUDED
TNXB, 2-BP DEL, 56063AA

In a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (606408), Schalkwijk et al.
(2001) identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion, 56063delAA, in exon 8 of
the TNXB gene. The 2-bp deletion altered the open reading frame,
affecting amino acids 1184 through 1230, after which a premature stop
codon was encountered. The patient's clinically normal father was
heterozygous for the deletion; the mother could not be studied. One
sister carried the deletion. An unrelated patient was also homozygous
for this mutation, but her parents were unavailable for study.

In a patient with the hypermobility type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
(130020), Zweers et al. (2003) identified heterozygosity for the
56063delAA mutation.

.0003
EHLERS-DANLOS-LIKE SYNDROME DUE TO TENASCIN-X DEFICIENCY
TNXB, 2-BP INS, 44906GT

In a patient with recessive Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (606408), Schalkwijk
et al. (2001) identified a homozygous 2-bp insertion, 44906insGT, in
exon 3 of the TNXB gene. The insertion of GT replaced the glutamic acid
residue at position 707 with a stop codon. Additional family members
were not available for study.

.0004
EHLERS-DANLOS SYNDROME, HYPERMOBILITY TYPE
TNXB, VAL1195MET

In a patient with the hypermobility type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
(130020) and normal TNX serum levels, Zweers et al. (2005) identified a
heterozygous 3583A-G transition in the TNXB gene, resulting in a
val1195-to-met (V1195M) substitution. The V1195M mutation occurs in a
highly conserved region and was not identified in 96 control
individuals. Skin biopsy of the patient showed a significant increase in
elastic fiber length. The authors concluded that missense mutations in
the TNXB gene are also disease-causing.

614472	TITLE *614472 RING FINGER PROTEIN 123; RNF123
;;KIP1 UBIQUITINATION-PROMOTING COMPLEX 1; KPC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RNF123 is a cytoplasmic E3 ubiquitin ligase with a role in cell cycle
progression (Kamura et al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to rabbit Kpc1,
Kamura et al. (2004) identified human RNF123, which they called KPC1.
The deduced 1,314-amino acid protein has an N-terminal SPRY domain and a
C-terminal RING finger domain. Epitope-tagged KPC1 was expressed as a
cytoplasmic protein in transfected NIH-3T3 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis, Kamura et al. (2004) found that
epitope-tagged KPC1 interacted directly with KPC2 (UBAC1; 608129) and
exhibited pronounced E3 ubiquitin ligase activity toward p27(KIP1)
(CDKN1B; 600778), but not other substrates, in the presence of E1 (UBA1;
314370) and E2 (UBCH5A, or UBE2D1; 602961) enzymes. Both mono- and
polyubiquitinated forms of p27(KIP1) were detected, and
polyubiquitination required either UBC4 (UBE2D2; 602962) or UBCH5A. The
E3 activity of KPC1 toward p27(KIP1) was greater in the absence of PKC2.
Overexpression and knockdown studies with mouse fibroblasts revealed
that the KPC complex functioned in the cytoplasm, ubiquitinated
p27(KIP1) during G1 phase of the cell cycle, and required nuclear export
of p27(KIP1) by Crm1 (XPO1; 602559). Ubiquitination of p27(KIP1) at S
phase was performed by Skp2 (601436). Depletion of endogenous Kpc1 from
Skp2 -/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts resulted in p27(KIP1) accumulation
and a delay in cell cycle progression.

Using rat myoblast and fibroblast cell lines, Lu et al. (2009) showed
that the ubiquitin-specific protease Usp19 (614471) regulated p27(KIP1)
levels by deubiquitinating and stabilizing Kpc1 against proteasomal
degradation. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Usp19 interacted
directly with Kpc1. Knockdown of Usp19 resulted in loss of Kpc1,
accumulation of p27(KIP1), inhibition of cell proliferation, and slower
progression from G0/G1 to S phase.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the RPF123 gene to chromosome 3p21.31 based on an
alignment of the RPF123 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK022627) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).
