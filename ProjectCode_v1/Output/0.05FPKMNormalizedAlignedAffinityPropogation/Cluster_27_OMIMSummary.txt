DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The platelet GpIb complex (see 138720) mediates the adherence of
platelets at the site of vascular injury through the binding of
GpIb-alpha (231200) to subendothelial von Willebrand factor (VWF;
613160). In platelets, the GpIb complex is tightly bound to the actin
cytoskeleton via an interaction of GpIb-alpha with ABP280 (filamin A;
300017). Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with the cytoplasmic tail of
GpIb-alpha as bait, Takafuta et al. (1998) isolated partial cDNAs
encoding a novel filamin homolog that they designated beta-filamin. They
used the partial cDNAs to screen a placenta library and recovered
additional cDNAs corresponding to the entire beta-filamin coding region.
Like ABP280, the predicted 2,602-amino acid protein contains an
N-terminal actin-binding domain, a backbone of 24 tandem repeats, and 2
hinge regions. Excluding the unique first hinge region of beta-filamin,
the sequences of beta-filamin and ABP280 are 70% identical. Antibodies
against beta-filamin detected a 280-kD protein on Western blots of human
umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) extracts and stained normal
human endothelial cells in culture and in situ. Takafuta et al. (1998)
determined that the GpIb-alpha-binding domain in beta-filamin is in
repeats 17-20, a region that corresponds to the GpIb-alpha-binding
domain in ABP280. Northern blot analysis revealed that beta-filamin is
expressed as 2 approximately 9.5-kb mRNAs in many adult tissues. The 2
different transcripts appear to result from use of alternative
polyadenylation signals. Takafuta et al. (1998) concluded that
beta-filamin is a new member of the filamin family that may have
significance for GpIb-alpha function in endothelial cells and platelets.

Independently, Xu et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding beta-filamin,
which they referred to as ABP278. These authors also identified
alternatively spliced mRNAs encoding ABP276, a beta-filamin isoform
missing the first hinge region. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the 2
isoforms were expressed at different relative levels in various human
tissues.

The addition of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH; see 188540) to
cultured thyroid follicular cells induces rapid and profound disruption
of actin microfilaments. Using serum from a Graves disease (275000)
patient, Leedman et al. (1993) identified a thyroid cDNA encoding TABP
(truncated actin-binding protein), a predicted 195-amino acid protein
with homology to the C terminus of ABP280. Both Xu et al. (1998) and
Takafuta et al. (1998) considered TABP to be a truncated form of
beta-filamin.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Zhang et al. (1998) mapped the FH1
gene to chromosome 3. Takafuta et al. (1998) refined the map position to
3p21.1-p14.3 based on inclusion of a previously mapped STS within the
beta-filamin sequence. By FISH, Brocker et al. (1999) assigned the FLNB
gene to 3p14.3. Chakarova et al. (2000) mapped FLNB to 3p14 by radiation
hybrid analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Using antigen-capture ELISA, Takafuta et al. (1998) found that
beta-filamin associates with GpIb-alpha in both platelets and HUVEC
extracts.

Mutations in the presenilin genes PS1 (104311) and PS2 (600759) account
for approximately 50% of early-onset familial Alzheimer disease (AD;
104300). Zhang et al. (1998) identified beta-filamin as filamin homolog
1 (FH1), a filamin-related protein that interacts with the loop regions
of PS1 and PS2. A monoclonal antibody recognizing both ABP280 and FH1
bound to blood vessels and astrocytes in the normal brain. In the brains
of AD patients, Zhang et al. (1998) observed staining also in
neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads, and dystrophic neurites
within some senile plaques. The authors stated that detection of these
presenilin-interacting proteins in these brain structures suggests that
ABP280 and FH1 may be involved in the development of AD and that
interactions between presenilins and ABP280/FH1 may be functionally
significant. Takafuta et al. (1998) noted that the FH1 sequence is
identical to the C-terminal 291 amino acids of beta-filamin except for 2
residues, making it very likely that FH1 represents the C-terminal
region of beta-filamin.

Krakow et al. (2004) found that FLNB is expressed in human growth plate
chondrocytes and in developing vertebral bodies in the mouse. The
authors concluded that FLNB plays a role in vertebral segmentation,
joint formation, and endochondral ossification.

Mutation in the X-linked gene filamin A (FLNA) can cause the neurologic
disorder periventricular heterotopia (300049). Although periventricular
heterotopia is characterized by a failure in neuronal migration into the
cerebral cortex with consequent formation of nodules in the ventricular
and subventricular zones, many neurons appear to migrate normally, even
in males, suggesting compensatory mechanisms. Sheen et al. (2002) showed
that, in mice, Flna mRNA was widely expressed in all brain cortical
layers, whereas a homolog, Flnb, was most highly expressed in the
ventricular and subventricular zones during development. In adulthood,
widespread but reduced expression of Flna and Flnb persisted throughout
the cerebral cortex. Flna and Flnb proteins were highly expressed in
both the leading processes and somata of migratory neurons during
corticogenesis. Postnatally, Flna immunoreactivity was largely localized
to the cell body, whereas Flnb was localized to the soma and neuropil
during neuronal differentiation. The putative Flnb homodimerization
domain strongly interacted with itself or the corresponding homologous
region of Flna, as shown by yeast 2-hybrid interaction. The 2 proteins
colocalized within neuronal precursors by immunocytochemistry, and the
existence of Flna-Flnb heterodimers could be detected by
coimmunoprecipitation. Sheen et al. (2002) suggested that FLNA and FLNB
may form both homodimers and heterodimers, and that their interaction
could potentially compensate for the loss of FLNA function during
cortical development within patients with periventricular heterotopia.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Krakow et al. (2004) identified mutations in the FLNB gene in 4 human
skeletal disorders: spondylocarpotarsal syndrome (SCT; 272460), Larsen
syndrome (150250), type I atelosteogenesis (AOI; 108720), and type III
atelosteogenesis (AOIII; 108721).

Biesecker (2004) commented that from the standpoint of the clinical
geneticist, 4 distinct disorders result from mutation in the FLNB gene.
In contrast, a basic scientist might view them as a single disorder with
inconsequential phenotypic differences. The information concerning the
multiple disorders caused by mutations in the FLNB gene followed closely
on the heels of reports of mutations in the FLNA gene (300017) as the
cause of 5 distinct disorders. This was of interest because there are
overlapping phenotypic features in the disorders associated with FLNA
and FLNB. Biesecker (2004) pointed out that the 'FLNB story' used
information from the International Skeletal Dysplasia Registry (ISDR),
which is maintained by a skilled group of clinical scientists and
includes information on more than 12,000 cases of individuals with
disorders that fall into 50 diagnostic groups. One reason for the
success of the registry is that it combines clinical service with
research archives. The motivation for a clinician to submit cases to the
registry is that he or she can receive an expert opinion on the
diagnosis (which is useful for medical care and estimating recurrence
risks) and, as in the FLNB story, contribute to research.

In a 22-week male fetus previously studied by Krakow et al. (2004) and a
17-week male fetus previously described by Wessels et al. (2003), both
diagnosed with boomerang dysplasia (112310), Bicknell et al. (2005)
identified heterozygosity for mutations in the FLNB gene, leu171 to arg
(L171R; 603381.0009) and ser235 to pro (S235P; 603381.0010),
respectively.

Farrington-Rock et al. (2006) found 14 novel missense mutations in FLNB
in 15 unrelated patients with atelosteogenesis I and/or atelosteogenesis
III. Most of the mutations resided in exons 2 and 3, which encode the
CH2 domain of the actin-binding region of filamin B. The remaining
mutations were found in exon 28 and exon 29, which encode repeats 14 and
15 of filamin B. Clinical and radiographic data were used to confirm the
diagnosis of atelosteogenesis in all the patients. The diagnosis of type
I was given to patients showing classic findings of absent, shortened,
or distally tapered humeri and femora; absent, shortened, or bowed
radii; shortened and bowed ulnae and tibiae; and absent fibulae. Other
findings included vertebral hypoplasia with coronal clefts, 11 ribs,
shortened wide distal phalanges, and unossified or partially ossified
metacarpals and middle and proximal phalanges. In addition, most type I
patients showed evidence of a hypoplastic pelvis, dislocations of the
hips, elbows, and knees, and clubbed feet. With the exception of 1
patient where the pregnancy was terminated after 24 weeks' gestation,
the patients given the diagnosis of type I either died in the neonatal
period or were stillborn. The diagnosis of type III was given to
patients when all bones were present in the extremities, when there was
distal tapering of the humeri or femora, and where the small tubular
bones of the hands and feet were shortened and broad. In 2 patients with
type III, the fibulae were absent. Dislocation of the elbows, hips, and
knees and clubbed feet were also present in the type III patients, as
was vertebral hypoplasia with coronal clefting. Cartilage of these
patients showed acellular areas within the growth plate and the presence
of large multinuclear cells ('giant cells') within the resting zone as
had been described previously.

Bicknell et al. (2007) identified heterozygous mutations in the FLNB
gene (see, e.g., 603381.0011; 603381.0012) in 20 unrelated patients with
Larsen syndrome. The distribution of mutations within the gene was
nonrandom, with clusters of mutations in the actin-binding domains and
filamin repeats 13 through 17 being the most common.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhou et al. (2007) detected strong expression of the mouse Flnb gene in
vascular endothelial cells and chondrocytes. In Flnb -/- mice, the
authors observed a phenotype that resembled those of human skeletal
disorders with mutations in the FLNB gene. Less than than 3% of Flnb -/-
embryos reached term, indicating that the Flnb gene is important in
embryonic development, whereas Flnb +/- mice were indistinguishable from
their wildtype sibs. Flnb -/- embryos had impaired development of
microvasculature and skeletal systems. The few that were born were very
small and had scoliotic and kyphotic spines, lack of intervertebral
discs, fusion of vertebral bodies, and reduced hyaline matrix in bones
of the extremities, thorax, and vertebrae.

Farrington-Rock et al. (2008) generated Fnlb -/- mice and observed a
phenotype of short stature and skeletal abnormalities similar to those
of individuals with spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome (SCT;
272460). Newborn Flnb -/- mice had fusions between the neural arches of
the vertebrae in the cervical and thoracic spine. At postnatal day 60,
the vertebral fusions were more widespread and involved the vertebral
bodies as well as the neural arches. In addition, fusions were seen in
sternum and carpal bones. Analysis of the Flnb -/- mice phenotype showed
that an absence of filamin B causes progressive vertebral fusions, in
contrast to the previous hypothesis that SCT results from failure of
normal spinal segmentation. Farrington-Rock et al. (2008) suggested that
spinal segmentation can occur normally in the absence of filamin B, but
that the protein is required for maintenance of intervertebral, carpal,
and sternal joints, and the joint fusion process commences antenatally.

in exon 36 of the FLNB gene, resulting in an arg2004-to-ter (R2004X)
substitution. In addition to the typical findings of SCT, the boy
demonstrated ossification delay of multiple epiphyses and bilateral
proximal femoral epiphyseal dysplasia.

.0014
SPONDYLOCARPOTARSAL SYNOSTOSIS SYNDROME
FLNB, GLY1850TER

In an Italian girl with spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome
(272460), born of consanguineous parents, Brunetti-Pierri et al. (2008)
identified a homozygous 5548G-T transversion in the FLNB gene, resulting
in a gly1850-to-ter (G1850X) substitution. She had short stature,
scoliosis, short trunk, delayed bone age, vertebral fusions, and
capitate-hamate fusion. She did not have facial dysmorphic features.
Growth hormone (GH) deficiency was documented, but there was no response
to GH administration. MRI scan did not show any abnormality of the
hypothalamo-pituitary area, but there was platybasia and basilar
impression, stenosis of the foramen magnum, but no signs of medullary
compression at the cervicomedullary junction. A younger brother, who was
heterozygous for the mutation, had short stature and transient GH
deficiency.

611685	TITLE *611685 RING FINGER PROTEIN 8; RNF8
;;KIAA0646
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones from a size-fractionated brain cDNA library,
Ishikawa et al. (1998) cloned RNF8, which they designated KIAA0646. The
cDNA contains repetitive elements in its 3-prime end. The deduced
485-amino acid protein contains a C3HC4-type zinc finger signature,
suggesting that it is involved in nucleic acid management. RT-PCR
analysis detected moderate RNF8 expression in brain, testis, and ovary,
with little to no expression in all other tissues examined. In vitro
translation resulted in a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 62
kD by SDS-PAGE.

Using oligo capping, Seki et al. (1998) cloned RNF8 from a neuroblastoma
cDNA library. The deduced 485-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 56 kD. RT-PCR analysis detected variable expression in
all human tissues examined except spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis and protein pull-down assays, Takano et
al. (2004) showed that RNF8 and retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXRA; 180245)
interacted via their N-terminal regions. Overexpression of RNF8 in COS-7
cells resulted in interaction and colocalization of RNF8 and RXRA in the
nucleus. A point mutation in RNF8 that disrupted the RING finger or
deletion of the N-terminal region of RNF8 prevented localization of RNF8
to the nucleus without affecting nuclear localization of RXRA. Transient
overexpression of RNF8 enhanced RXRA-mediated transactivation of an
RXR-responsive element (RXRE) in a dose-dependent and retinoic
acid-independent manner and upregulated expression of genes downstream
of RXRE. Enhancement of transactivation was not seen with RNF8 carrying
the RING finger-disrupting mutation or the N-terminal deletion. Takano
et al. (2004) concluded that RNF8 is a regulator of RXRA-mediated
transcriptional activity.

Kolas et al. (2007) determined that the ubiquitin ligase RNF8 mediates
ubiquitin conjugation and 53BP1 (605230) and BRCA1 (113705) focal
accumulation at sites of DNA lesions. Moreover, Kolas et al. (2007)
established that MDC1 recruits RNF8 through phosphodependent
interactions between the RNF8 forkhead-associated domain and motifs in
MDC1 that are phosphorylated by the DNA damage-activated protein kinase
ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM; 607585). They showed that depletion
of the E2 enzyme UBC13 (603679) impairs 53BP1 recruitment to sites of
damage, which suggests that it cooperates with RNF8. RNF8 was also shown
to promote the G(2)/M DNA damage checkpoint and resistance to ionizing
radiation. Kolas et al. (2007) concluded that their results demonstrated
how the DNA damage response is orchestrated by ATM-dependent
phosphorylation of MDC1 and RNF8-mediated ubiquitination.

Yan et al. (2012) noted that RNF8 works with UBC13 to catalyze
lys63-linked polyubiquitination of H2A (see 613499)-type histones at
sites of DNA damage. They found that depletion of RNF8 in HeLa cells
abrogated the recruitment of FAAP20 (C1OR86; 615183) to sites of DNA
damage. Knockdown of either RNF8 or FAAP20 abrogated the recruitment of
FANCA (607139) and FANCD2 (613984) to sites of DNA damage.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the RNF8
gene to chromosome 6. Seki et al. (1998) mapped the RNF8 gene to
chromosome 6p21.3 by somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses.

ANIMAL MODEL

Santos et al. (2010) reported that Rnf8 -/- mice were defective in class
switch recombination (CSR) and accumulated immunoglobulin heavy chain
(IgH; see 147100)-associated double-strand breaks (DSB). The CSR DSB
repair defect was milder than that in 53bp1 -/- mice, but similar to
that in H2ax (601772) -/- mice. Like H2ax -/- mice, Rnf8 -/- males were
sterile, and this was associated with defective XY chromatin
ubiquitylation. Mice lacking both H2ax and Rnf8 did not have further
impairment of CSR. Although 53bp1 foci formation is Rnf8 dependent,
53bp1 could bind to chromatin in the absence of Rnf8. Santos et al.
(2010) proposed that there is a 2-step mechanism for 53BP1 association
with chromatin in which constitutive loading is dependent on
interactions with methylated histones, whereas DNA damage-inducible
RNF8-dependent ubiquitylation allows its accumulation at damaged
chromatin.

Li et al. (2010) studied Rnf8 -/- mice and observed growth retardation,
reduced hematopoietic populations, impaired spermatogenesis, impaired
CSR, and increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation in vitro and in
vivo. Activated Rnf8 -/- B cells were able to recruit reduced amounts of
53bp1 via Rnf8-independent mechanisms. Rnf8 -/- mice also had a somewhat
increased cancer predisposition. Li et al. (2010) concluded that RNF8 is
a tumor suppressor whose loss also results in increased
non-cancer-related mortality, likely due to immunodeficiency.

611557	TITLE *611557 UROPLAKIN 1A; UPK1A
;;UPIA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The asymmetric unit membrane (AUM) forms the apical plaques of mammalian
urothelium and is believed to strengthen the urothelial apical surface
and prevent the cells from rupturing during bladder distention. The
major conserved integral membrane proteins are UPK1A, UPK1B (602380),
UPK2 (611558), and UPK3 (UPK3A; 611559) (Wu et al., 1994).

CLONING

Wu et al. (1994) isolated AUMs from 8 mammalian species, including
human. Western blot analysis detected UPK1A at an apparent molecular
mass close to that of 27-kD bovine Upk1a. Electron microscopy revealed
that AUMs isolated from cattle, dog, mouse, and monkey were 12-nm
protein particles forming hexagonally packed crystalline patches.

By database analysis, followed by RT-PCR of human urothelial mRNA,
Lobban et al. (1998) cloned a partial UPK1A cDNA, which they called
UPIA. RT-PCR showed UPIA was expressed at high levels in normal
urothelium and at low levels in moderately differentiated transitional
cell urothelium carcinomas. In situ hybridization detected UPIA
expression restricted to the superficial cells of urothelium. No
expression was detected in any of the nonurothelial tissues examined.

By screening a human urothelial cDNA library, followed by RT-PCR of a
urothelial cell line, Hall et al. (2005) cloned UPK1A. The deduced
protein contains 256 amino acids and shares 88% identity with its mouse
homolog. Quantitative real-time PCR detected high expression of UPK1A in
normal ureteric urothelium. No other tissue expressed UPK1A, with the
exception of normal prostate, which showed very weak UPK1A expression.
EST database analysis revealed expression only in genitourinary tract,
prostate, uterus, and a pooled cDNA library.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hall et al. (2005) determined that the UPK1A gene contains 8 exons and
spans about 12 kb. The first exon is noncoding. The promoter region
contains a TATA box. Using reporter gene assays with a urothelial tumor
cell line, Hall et al. (2005) found maximal activity with a nucleotide
fragment that spanned the 5-prime flanking region from nucleotide -2147.
Truncation of this sequence or inclusion of additional upstream
sequences caused reduced promoter activity.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hall et al. (2005) mapped the UPK1A gene
to chromosome 19q13.1.

;;OXYTOCIN--NEUROPHYSIN I;;
OT
NEUROPHYSIN I, INCLUDED;;
PREPROOXYTOCIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FUNCTION

The nonapeptide hormones arginine vasopressin (AVP; 192340) and oxytocin
are synthesized in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the
hypothalamus together with their respective 'carrier' proteins, the
neurophysins (Brownstein et al., 1980). Vasopressin and oxytocin are
produced by separate populations of magnocellular neurons in both
nuclei. Together with the neurophysins they are packaged into
neurosecretory vesicles and transported axonally to the nerve endings in
the neurohypophysis, where they are either stored or secreted into the
bloodstream.

The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and the supraoptic nucleus (SON) in
the rat contain estrogen-regulated oxytocin and arginine-vasopressin
systems, but little or no estrogen receptor-alpha (133430). Using
estradiol-treated ovariectomized young adult Sprague-Dawley rats and
dual-labeled immunocytochemistry, Alves et al. (1998) showed that OXT-ir
(OXT-immunoreactivity) colocalized with ESR-beta (601663)-ir in the
parvicellular subnuclei of PVN but there was little AVP-/ESR-beta-ir. In
contrast, in the SON, most nuclear ESR-beta-ir colocalized with AVP-ir,
whereas few OXT-/ESR-beta-ir dual-labeled cells were observed. These
results suggested that estrogen can directly modulate specific OXT and
AVP systems through an ESR-beta-mediated mechanism, in a tissue-specific
manner.

Kosfeld et al. (2005) analyzed the effect of exogenously administered
oxytocin by internasal spray on individuals' decisions in a trust game
with real monetary stakes. In this trust game, 2 subjects interacting
anonymously played the role of either an investor or a trustee. Subjects
who received oxytocin were much more likely to exhibit trust in the
transfer of funds. Kosfeld et al. (2005) also showed that the effect of
oxytocin on trust was not due to a general increase in the readiness to
bear risks. On the contrary, they showed that oxytocin specifically
affects an individual's willingness to accept social risks arising
through interpersonal interactions. Kosfeld et al. (2005) concluded that
their results concurred with animal research suggesting an essential
role for oxytocin as a biologic basis of prosocial approach behavior.

Tyzio et al. (2006) reported a signaling mechanism in rats between
mother and fetus aimed at preparing fetal neurons for delivery. In
immature neurons, GABA is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter. Tyzio
et al. (2006) found that shortly before delivery there was a transient
reduction in the intracellular chloride concentration and an
excitatory-to-inhibitory switch of GABA actions. These events were
triggered by oxytocin, an essential maternal hormone for labor. In vivo
administration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist before delivery
prevented the switch of GABA actions in fetal neurons and aggravated the
severity of anoxic episodes. Thus, maternal oxytocin inhibits fetal
neurons and increases their resistance to insults during delivery.

Carbillon (2007) commented on the paper by Tyzio et al. (2006) and
suggested that there is a body of evidence supporting the possibility
that oxytocin is released not only from the mother, but from the fetal
pituitary during delivery, particularly under conditions of hypoxic
stress. Tyzio et al. (2007) tested the hypothesis that cortisol-induced
release of fetal oxytocin triggers a perinatal inhibitory switch in GABA
signaling. The cortisol analog methylprednisolone did not modify GABA
driving force and intracellular chloride concentration in 1-day-old rat
hippocampal neurons. Tyzio et al. (2007) concluded that, together with
the immaturity of the fetal rat hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system,
their results suggested that oxytocin in the rat fetal brain is mainly
provided by the mother.

De Dreu et al. (2010) linked oxytocin to the regulation of intergroup
conflict in humans. In 3 experiments using double-blind
placebo-controlled designs, male participants self-administered oxytocin
or placebo and made decisions with financial consequences to themselves,
their in-group, and a competing out-group. Results showed that oxytocin
drives a 'tend and defend' response in that it promoted in-group trust
and cooperation and defensive, but not offensive, aggression toward
competing out-groups.

Viviani et al. (2011) combined fluorescent retrograde tracing of central
amygdala projections to nuclei that modulate fear-related freezing or
cardiovascular responses with in vitro electrophysiologic recordings and
with in vivo monitoring of related behavioral and physiologic parameters
in rat. Central amygdala projections emerged from separate neuronal
populations with different electrophysiologic characteristics and
different response properties to oxytocin. In vivo, oxytocin decreased
freezing responses in fear-conditioned rats without affecting the
cardiovascular response. Thus, Viviani et al. (2011) concluded that
neuropeptidergic signaling can modulate the central amygdala outputs
through separate neuronal circuits and thereby individually steer the
various aspects of the fear response.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sausville et al. (1985) found that the genes for
prepro-arginine-vasopressin-neurophysin I and II (192340) have a similar
intron-exon structure, are linked (on chromosome 20) with 12 kb
intervening DNA, and are transcribed from opposite DNA strands. In a
human small cell lung cancer (182280) cell line, they found that the
first but not the second strand was actively transcribed. It appears
that the AVP, PDYN (131340) and OXT genes constitute a cluster.

MAPPING

Repaske et al. (1990) identified a RFLP with XbaI within 15 kb of AVP
and used this as a marker in linkage studies. They demonstrated that the
AVP/OXT loci map to the distal short arm of chromosome 20 about 15 cM
toward the telomere from the D20S5 locus, which is located near the
middle of the short arm at 20p12.21. Summar et al. (1990) presented
linkage data that placed the AVP and OXT loci at 20pter-p12.21. Growth
hormone-releasing factor (139190) maps to the same general area.

Gopal Rao et al. (1992) used isotopic and fluorescence in situ
hybridization to map the OXT locus to 20p13.

In the mouse, Marini et al. (1993) noted that Avp and Oxt are separated
by only 3.5-kb of intergenic sequence. By interspecific backcross
analysis, they mapped this pair of genes to mouse chromosome 2.

ANIMAL MODEL

The development of social familiarity in rodents depends predominantly
on olfactory cues and can critically influence reproductive success.
This memory is operationally defined by a reliable decrease in olfactory
investigation in repeated or prolonged encounters with a conspecific.
Brain oxytocin and AVP seemed to modulate a range of social behavior
from parental care to mate guarding. AVP administration may enhance
social memory, whereas OXT administration may either inhibit or
facilitate social memory, depending on dose, route, or paradigm.
Ferguson et al. (2000) found that male mice mutant for the Oxt gene
failed to develop social memory, whereas wildtype mice showed intact
social memory. These and other observations indicated that oxytocin is
necessary for the normal development of memory in mice and supported the
hypothesis that social memory has a neural basis distinct from other
forms of memory.

Kavaliers et al. (2006) demonstrated that female mice use olfactory
input to acquire what is known as 'inadvertent social information'
(ISI), or indirect social cues, to determine their social interest in
males and mate choice. Compared to wildtype female mice, Oxt-null
females showed an impaired ability to use olfactory information to
modulate their response to males, suggesting that Oxt is necessary for
proper processing of ISI and for integration of both direct and indirect
social information.

Jin et al. (2007) showed that adult Cd38 (107270) knockout female and
male mice showed marked defects in maternal nurturing and social
behavior, respectively, with higher locomotor activity. Consistently,
the plasma level of oxytocin, but not vasopressin (192340), was strongly
decreased in Cd38-null mice. Replacement of oxytocin by subcutaneous
injection or lentiviral vector-mediated delivery of human CD38 in the
hypothalamus rescued social memory and maternal care in Cd38-null mice.
Depolarization-induced oxytocin secretion and calcium ion elevation in
oxytocinergic neurohypophysial axon terminals were disrupted in
Cd38-null mice. This was mimicked by Cd38 metabolite antagonists in Cd38
wildtype mice. Jin et al. (2007) concluded that CD38 has a key role in
neuropeptide release, thereby critically regulating maternal and social
behaviors, and may be an element in neurodevelopmental disorders.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Based on its similarity with mouse Csp-gamma, Fernandez-Chacon et al.
(2004) identified DNAJC5G, which they called CSP-gamma. The deduced
189-amino acid human CSP-gamma protein contains an N-terminal DNAJ
domain. Northern blot analysis and real-time RT-PCR detected Csp-gamma
in mouse testis, but not in other adult tissues or brain.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the DNAJC5G gene to chromosome 2p23.3. based on an
alignment of the DNAJC5G sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF368277) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

line indicated that the inserted chromosome can delay the onset of
tumors and in some cases completely repress the tumorigenic potential.
In situ hybridization showed that the clones that reverted to the
malignant phenotype had expelled the inserted chromosome. The authors
stated that LOH of 7q31.1 had frequently been found in squamous cell
carcinomas of the head and neck and in colon and prostate carcinomas.

To determine whether this putative tumor suppressor gene is conserved in
mice, Zenklusen et al. (1996) studied LOH in chemically induced mouse
liver adenomas. The LOH analysis was performed by PCR amplification of
17 (CA)n microsatellite repeats on mouse chromosome 6A2-C3. In 106
cases, 96 (90.6%) had LOH at 1 marker; LOH was found in 89.5% at a
second marker. These 2 loci were 0.2 cM apart on mouse chromosome 6A2.
Another site with high LOH was found in the C3 band of chromosome 6. The
high incidence of LOH in segments of mouse chromosome 6 homologous to
human 7q indicated that the human ST7 is conserved in the mouse and is
involved in the development of hepatomas.

Vincent et al. (2000) studied an individual with autism (209850) who
carried the translocation t(7;13)(q31.3;q21). The chromosomal 7
breakpoint is located in the region of 7q in which a susceptibility
locus for autism had been postulated. Using a combination of DNA
sequence analysis and cDNA screening of human colon carcinoma and fetal
brain cDNA libraries, Vincent et al. (2000) cloned the ST7 gene, which
they designated RAY1 (or FAM4A1), which spanned the translocation
breakpoint. The gene contains 16 exons and extends more than 220 kb at
7q31.3. Alternatively spliced transcripts differing at exon 7 and having
2 different exon 16s encode deduced proteins of 554 and 585 amino acids.
Apparent homologs of RAY1 had been identified in mouse, rat, pig,
chicken, fruit fly, and nematode. Vincent et al. (2000) determined that
the human and mouse RAY1 genes share similar splicing patterns, and that
their predicted protein products are 98% identical.

In a mutation screening of the entire coding region of the RAY1 gene in
a set of 27 unrelated autistic individuals, Vincent et al. (2000) failed
to identify phenotype-specific variants, suggesting that coding
mutations of RAY1 are unlikely to be involved in the etiology of autism.

In a search for a tumor suppressor gene in the 7q31 critical region,
Zenklusen et al. (2001) cloned ST7. The ST7 cDNA is 2,187 basepairs with
an open reading frame spanning 1,602 basepairs. The 16 exons, ranging
from 69 to 360 basepairs, are distributed across an approximately 130-kb
genomic segment. ST7 exons 2 to 16 are identical to those reported for
RAY1; however, ST7 exon 1 (containing the 5-prime untranslated region
and start codon) is different from the RAY1 exon 1, most likely
reflecting alternative splice forms. As a result, the predicted
N-terminal amino acids of the ST7-encoded protein and the N-terminal 50
amino acids of RAY1-encoded protein are different. Northern blot
analysis revealed 2 predominant ST7 transcripts. Some ST7 mRNAs lacked
exon 7, but this does not account for the multiple splice forms, as exon
7 consists of only 69 basepairs. The ST7 protein is likely to fold into
a basic globular structure with a predicted molecular weight of 60.3 kD
and an isoelectric point of 8.10. The predicted secondary structure
contains 12 alpha-helices with 4 turns. The ST7 gene is predicted to
encode a protein of 534 amino acids that is highly conserved, with
orthologous sequences detected in mouse, cow, pufferfish, and C.
elegans. Such a high degree of evolutionary conservation indicates a
critical role for ST7, as is the case for most tumor suppressor genes.
Six mutations in ST7 were identified in breast tumors and primary colon
carcinomas. Introduction of the ST7 cDNA into the prostate
cancer-derived cell line PC3 had no effect on the in vitro proliferation
of the cells, but abrogated their in vivo tumorigenicity in nude mice.
The ST7 mutations are predicted to yield a truncated protein, indicating
that the complete abrogation of ST7 function may be required for tumor
development. Zenklusen et al. (2001) postulated that ST7 has a role in
regulating cell-environment or cell-cell interactions.

Contrary to the conclusions of Zenklusen et al. (2001) that ST7 is the
tumor suppressor gene in the 7q31 region, Thomas et al. (2001) did not
detect somatic mutations in ST7 in any of 149 primary ovarian, breast,
or colon carcinomas. They interpreted the data as suggesting that
epigenetic downregulation or haploinsufficiency, rather than somatic
genetic alterations, may be the primary mechanism of abrogation of ST7
function in these tumor types. Furthermore, Hughes et al. (2001) failed
to find truncating mutations in 3 cell lines previously reported to
contain such mutations or any primary breast and/or ovarian tumors.

611213	TITLE *611213 RELT-LIKE 2; RELL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database analysis to search for sequences with similarity to RELT
(611211), Cusick et al. (2006) cloned full-length RELL1 (611212) and
RELL2. The predicted RELL2 sequence contains a transmembrane domain but
lacks extracellular cysteine-rich domains. RELL2 shares 27% and 40%
amino acid identity with RELT and RELL1, respectively. Northern blot
analysis detected an approximately 3-kb transcript primarily in human
immune-related tissues such as spleen, thymus, testis, peripheral blood
leukocytes, and placenta. RELL2 mRNA was not detected in prostate,
ovary, small intestine, colon, heart, lung, liver, skeletal muscle,
kidney, or pancreas. Immunofluorescent confocal microscopy localized
RELL2 to the plasma membrane in COS-7 cells and colocalized RELL2 with
RELL1 and RELT.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation studies, Cusick et al. (2006) showed that
showed that RELL2 bound RELL1, RELT, and serine-threonine kinase OSR1
(OXSR1; 604046). By in vitro kinase assay, Cusick et al. (2006) showed
that RELL1, RELL2, and RELT were phosphorylated by OSR1.

606125	TITLE *606125 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 8; TRIM8
;;RING FINGER PROTEIN 27; RNF27;;
GLIOBLASTOMA-EXPRESSED RING FINGER PROTEIN; GERP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RING finger motif is a unique zinc-chelating domain involved in
mediating protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. RING finger
protein-27 belongs to the RBCC (RING finger B-box coiled-coil), or
C3HC4, subfamily, members of which have been implicated in
transcriptional regulation, carcinogenesis, and cell transformation.

CLONING

Using PCR with primers derived from ESTs, Vincent et al. (2000) cloned
an RNF27 cDNA, which they called GERP, encoding a deduced 551-amino acid
protein with an N-terminal RING finger motif, 2 B-boxes, a coiled-coil
domain, and a proline-rich C terminus. The RNF27 protein shares 97%
sequence identity with the mouse homolog. Northern blot analysis
revealed a 5-kb transcript in kidney as well as in brain, heart,
skeletal muscle, and lung. Lower levels of expression were detected in
placenta, liver, leukocytes, and intestine. Vincent et al. (2000) noted
that human ESTs corresponding to the RNF27 sequence have been found in a
variety of tumors, including anaplastic oligodendrogliomas.

Using a B-box domain consensus sequence to screen EST databases for
novel TRIM family members, Reymond et al. (2001) identified and cloned
mouse and human TRIM8. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous
expression of a 3-kb transcript in adult human tissues. In situ
hybridization of mouse embryos indicated highest expression in central
nervous tissue, kidney, and lens, and lower expression in gut.
Fluorescence-tagged TRIM8 showed punctate nuclear and perinuclear
expression in transfected osteocarcinoma and HeLa cells that did not
colocalize with coil bodies, spliceosomes, PML (102578) bodies, or BRCA1
(113705) bodies. Disruption of the RING domain, the B-box domain, or the
coiled-coil region caused redistribution and more diffuse staining of
cytoplasmic and nuclear structures.

Toniato et al. (2002) cloned mouse Trim8 in a yeast 2-hybrid screen
using mouse Socs1 (603597) as bait. The mouse, rat, and human TRIM8
proteins share 90% amino acid identity. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of Trim8 in most mouse tissues, with highest expression in
heart, liver, and thymus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using several in vitro and in vivo protein-protein interaction
techniques, Reymond et al. (2001) found that TRIM8 forms
high-molecular-mass homomultimers. Mutation analysis suggested that the
coiled-coil domain mediates complex formation.

Toniato et al. (2002) found that gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) could
induce Trim8 expression in mouse B-lymphoid cells, mouse fibroblasts,
and in HeLa cells. IFNG treatment also induced an association between
Trim8 and Socs1, and the association was enhanced by the addition of a
proteasome inhibitor. Toniato et al. (2002) determined that Trim8 could
downregulate the protein level of Socs1 and inhibit Socs1 function in a
dose-dependent manner. Mutation analysis revealed that the interaction
between these proteins was mediated by a region immediately C-terminal
to the RING domain of Trim8 and by the SH2 domain of SOCS1.

MAPPING

Vincent et al. (2000) identified the RNF27 sequence in a contig mapped
to chromosome 10q24.3, a region showing frequent deletion or loss of
heterozygosity in glioblastomas. By radiation hybrid analysis, Reymond
et al. (2001) mapped the TRIM8 gene to chromosome 10q24.

610812	TITLE *610812 HYDROCEPHALUS-INDUCING, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; HYDIN
;;HYDIN1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a candidate gene approach to identify the mutant gene in the Hy3
mouse model of hydrocephalus, Davy and Robinson (2003) identified mouse
Hydin and its human ortholog. The mouse Hydin protein contains 5,099
amino acids. In situ hybridization of embryonic day-15 mouse brain
revealed Hydin expression in the developing choroid plexus. Expression
in newborn brain was observed exclusively in ependymal cells, a
specialized ciliated epithelium lining the lateral, third, and fourth
ventricles. Hydin mRNA was also detected in bronchi of lung,
spermatocytes within seminiferous tubules, and the oviduct lining
extending out to the fimbriae.

Doggett et al. (2006) determined that the predicted 5,120-amino acid
human HYDIN protein shares 77% with the mouse protein. By genomic
sequence analysis, they identified a duplicated copy of HYDIN, HYDIN2
(610813), on chromosome 1. Database and sequence analyses revealed HYDIN
transcripts that had been isolated from lung, testis, NT2 neuronal
precursor cells, and Jurkat leukemic T cells, whereas HYDIN2 transcripts
had been isolated from brain and NT2 cells only. Both genes appeared to
be expressed as alternatively spliced transcripts. Northern blot
analysis of human testis detected HYDIN transcripts of 6 kb and more
than 9 kb. Database analysis indicated that HYDIN is evolutionarily
conserved.

GENE STRUCTURE

Doggett et al. (2006) determined that the HYDIN gene contains 86 exons
and spans more than 423 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Davy and Robinson (2003) mapped the HYDIN
gene to chromosome 16q22. They mapped the mouse Hydin gene to a region
of chromosome 8 that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome
16q22.

By genomic sequence analysis, Doggett et al. (2006) mapped the HYDIN
gene to chromosome 16q22.2, and they identified a duplicated copy,
HYDIN2, on chromosome 1q21.1.

EVOLUTION

Using PCR and FISH, Doggett et al. (2006) confirmed that duplication of
the HYDIN gene is specific to humans. A large and diverse sample of
humans contained both HYDIN and HYDIN2, and there was no evidence for
polymorphic presence of HYDIN2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 sibs, born of consanguineous German parent (family OP-305), with
primary ciliary dyskinesia-5 without situs inversus (CILD5; 608647),
Olbrich et al. (2012) identified a homozygous splice site mutation in
the HYDIN gene (610812.0001). The mutation was found by homozygosity
mapping followed by candidate gene sequencing. Olbrich et al. (2012)
also identified a homozygous truncating mutation in the HYDIN gene
(K307X; 610812.0002) in affected individuals from 3 families originating
from the Faroe Islands (UCL96, UCL109, and UCL139) with CILD5 without
situs inversus previously reported by Jeganathan et al. (2004). The
mutation was identified by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by
Sanger sequencing in 2 sibs from 1 family (UCL109) and was not found in
several exome databases. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect
in these 3 families. The findings were consistent with a loss of
function. All patients had onset of respiratory distress in early
infancy. Other features included chronic wet cough, recurrent
bronchitis, pneumonia, otitis media, chronic rhinosinusitis, and
bronchiectasis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of patient
respiratory cilia showed that most exhibited a normal 9+2 axonemal
composition, with 9 outer microtubule doublets surrounding 2 single
central microtubules, and both outer and inner dynein arms showed no
abnormalities. There were rare occurrences of 9+0 and 8+1 cilia, but
most cross-sections appeared entirely normal. Thus, routine TEM findings
were nonspecific and not sufficient for diagnosis of CILD. However,
imaging with the higher resolution electron microscopy tomography showed
that projection C2b was absent at the central pair (CP) apparatus.
High-speed videomicroscopy of respiratory cilia and sperm flagella
showed markedly reduced coordination of beating activity, reduced
beating amplitudes, and reduced bending capacity; some immotile cilia
were also observed. Olbrich et al. (2012) noted that the lack of situs
inversus in patients with HYDIN mutations is consistent with the
specific defect of the CP apparatus, which is not needed for cilia
function at the embryonic node.

In a 48-year-old man with primary ciliary dyskinesia from a
consanguineous family of European descent, Davidson et al. (2013)
identified homozygosity for a splice site mutation in the HYDIN gene
(610812.0003) that segregated with disease in the family. The patient,
who also had retinitis pigmentosa (615434), was also found to be
homozygous for a missense mutation in the ARL2BP gene (M45R;
615407.0002).

ANIMAL MODEL

Hy3 is a spontaneous autosomal recessive mutation in mice that causes
lethal communicating hydrocephalus with perinatal onset. Davy and
Robinson (2003) determined that Hy3 is caused by a 2-bp deletion in exon
15 of the Hydin gene, which results in premature termination of the
protein.

CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 5, WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS
HYDIN, 3985G-T

In 3 sibs, born of consanguineous German parents (family OP-305), with
primary ciliary dyskinesia-5 without situs inversus (CILD5; 608647),
Olbrich et al. (2012) identified a homozygous c.3985G-T transversion in
the first base of exon 27 of the HYDIN gene, affecting an evolutionarily
conserved acceptor splice site. RT-PCR on patient cells showed that the
mutation resulted in an abnormal transcript, with a 47-bp insertion
between exons 26 and 27, leading to a frameshift and premature
termination after the insertion of 62 novel amino acids. No normal HYDIN
transcripts were detected in patient cells. The results were consistent
with a loss of function. The mutation was found by homozygosity mapping
followed by candidate gene sequencing.

In affected individuals from 3 families (UCL96, UCL109, and UCL139) with
CILD5 without situs inversus (608647), all originating from the Faroe
Islands (Jeganathan et al., 2004), Olbrich et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous 922A-T transversion in exon 8 of the HYDIN gene, resulting in
a lys307-to-ter (K307X) substitution. The mutation was identified by
whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing in 2 sibs from
1 family (UCL109), and was not found in several exome databases. Each of
the unaffected parents was heterozygous for the mutation. Haplotype
analysis indicated a founder effect in these 3 families.

.0003
CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 5, WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS
HYDIN, IVS24AS, G-T, -1

In a 48-year-old man with primary ciliary dyskinesia-5 (608647) from a
consanguineous family of European descent, Davidson et al. (2013)
identified homozygosity for a c.3786-1G-T transversion at the splice
acceptor site of intron 24 of the HYDIN gene that segregated with
disease in the family. The splice site mutation was also found in 1 of
12,331 control alleles from the NHLBI Exome Variant Server database.
Electron microscopy of nasal epithelial cells confirmed the absence of
the C2B projection of the motile cilia. In addition, the patient had
retinitis pigmentosa (615434) and a homozygous missense mutation in the
ARL2BP gene (M45R; 615407.0003).

610734	TITLE *610734 ANKYRIN REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; ANKRD2
;;ANKYRIN REPEAT PROTEIN WITH PEST MOTIF AND PROLINE-RICH REGION; ARPP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ANKRD2 belongs to the conserved muscle ankyrin repeat protein (MARP)
family. Expression of MARPs is induced in response to physiologic
stress, injury, and hypertrophy (Miller et al., 2003).

CLONING

Kemp et al. (2000) cloned mouse Ankrd2 and obtained a partial human
ANKRD2 cDNA. The full-length 328-amino acid mouse protein contains an
ATP/GTP-binding domain in its N-terminal half and an ankyrin repeat
region in its C-terminal half. It also has a nuclear localization
signal, 2 protein-destabilizing PEST sequences, and 2 phosphorylation
sites. Northern blot and PCR analyses detected expression of mouse
Ankrd2 only in tissues containing striated muscle. In situ hybridization
of mouse embryos showed that Ankrd2 expression was restricted to the
myotome of somites at day 9.5. At later developmental stages, Ankrd2
expression was stronger in outer back muscles than intercostal muscles,
and it was not expressed in heart.

Pallavicini et al. (2001) obtained full-length human ANKRD2 from a
skeletal muscle EST database. The deduced 333-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 37.2 kD. It contains at least 4 ankyrin
repeats, several potential phosphorylation sites, a PEST sequence, and a
nuclear localization signal. ANKRD2 shares 89% amino acid identity with
mouse Ankrd2 and 43% identity with human CARP (ANKRD1; 609599). Northern
blot and RT-PCR analyses showed high ANKRD2 expression in skeletal
muscle and lower expression in heart, kidney, and prostate. Western blot
analysis detected a 42-kD ANKRD2 protein mainly in skeletal muscle, but
also in heart and kidney. Immunofluorescence analysis showed punctate
nuclear ANKRD2 staining in some human and mouse myoblasts in culture,
and ANKRD2 progressively accumulated in cytoplasm as differentiation
progressed. In adult skeletal muscle tissue sections, expression was
only detected in cytoplasm. ANKRD2 expression was restricted to slow
fibers of adult skeletal muscle, but not all slow fibers expressed
ANKRD2 at the same level. Expression of ANKRD2 was weak in human
dystrophic muscle.

Using Western blot analysis, Miller et al. (2003) detected a 55-kD
ANKRD2 protein in human heart. By RT-PCR of adult and fetal heart, they
obtained additional ANKRD2 sequence including an alternative upstream
ATG start codon that adds 113 N-terminal residues (13 kD) to the ANKRD2
protein. Miller et al. (2003) suggested that this predicted 50-kD ANKRD2
isoform is specific to heart. Immunofluorescence analysis did not detect
Ankrd2 in fetal rat cardiac myocytes. However, immunoelectron microscopy
showed colocalization of Ankrd2 with titin (TTN; 188840) in the I-band
region of adult cow heart. Ankrd2 also localized to the nucleus and
perinuclear region of adult rat heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Using suppression subtractive hybridization with mouse muscle organoid
cultures, Kemp et al. (2000) found that Ankrd2 expression increased
4-fold after 7 days of stretch. Ankrd2 expression also increased during
myoblast fusion and decreased upon differentiation to the prefusion
level.

Nakamura et al. (2002) found aberrant expression of CARP and ARPP in
atrophic muscles in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; see 105400).
ARPP was expressed in a checkerboard pattern in control skeletal muscle,
but the checkerboard pattern was absent in ALS muscle. Loss of the
checkerboard pattern was not restricted to severe cases, but also
occurred in mild cases with less atrophic muscles. ARPP was highly
expressed in nuclei of ALS muscle, and ARPP was frequently coexpressed
with fast MHC (see 160730), embryonic MHC (MYH3; 160720), and slow MHC
(MYH7; 160760) in ALS muscle fibers.

Using in vitro and in vivo binding experiments, Kojic et al. (2004)
showed that ANKRD2 interacted with the Z disc protein telethonin (TCAP;
604488), as well as with the transcription factors YB1 (NSEP1; 154030),
PML (102578) isoform IV, and p53 (TP53; 191170). ANKRD2 colocalized with
PML in punctate nuclear bodies in differentiated human myotubes. In
primary human myoblasts, no nuclear bodies were detected, and both
ANKRD2 and PML localized diffusely in the cytoplasm. ANKRD2 bound p53 in
vitro and in vivo and enhanced upregulation of the CDKN1A (116899)
promoter by p53. Kojic et al. (2004) hypothesized that ANKRD2 may be
involved in sensing stress signals and linking these to muscle gene
regulation.

Using immunohistochemical microscopy, Ishiguro et al. (2005) found that
ARPP was expressed in 33 (89.2%) of 37 of rhabdomyosarcomas tested.
Western blot analysis revealed ARPP in all rhabdomyosarcomas tested.
High ARPP expression was generally associated with morphologic evidence
of skeletal muscle differentiation of tumor cells. In contrast, ARPP was
expressed in only 8 (6.3%) of 126 non-rhabdomyosarcoma tumors examined.

Mckoy et al. (2005) found significant upregulation of Ankred2 mRNA and
protein in mouse tibialis anterior muscle following 4 and 7 days of
passive stretch. In fast muscles of kyphoscoliotic (see 605739) mutant
mice, which lack the hypertrophic response to overload but have a slower
muscle phenotype than wildtype mice, Ankrd2 expression was also
significantly upregulated. In contrast, denervation of rat soleus
muscle, which produces a shift toward the fast muscle phenotype, was
associated with marked downregulation of Ankrd2. Mckoy et al. (2005)
concluded that ANKRD2 is a stretch-response gene associated with slow
muscle function, and that it is part of a mechanotransduction system
separate from the one that regulates muscle mass.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pallavicini et al. (2001) determined that the ANKRD2 gene contains 9
exons and spans about 12 kb. The 5-prime flanking region contains a TATA
box and binding motifs for the muscle-specific transcription factors
MYOD (159970) and E47 (TCF3; 147141) and for NF-kappa-B (see 164011).

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Pallavicini et al. (2001) mapped the
ANKRD2 gene to chromosome 10q23.31-q23.32.

606295	TITLE *606295 PROTOCADHERIN-GAMMA, SUBFAMILY A, MEMBER 8; PCDHGA8
;;PCDH-GAMMA-A8;;
KIAA0327
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules, and
protocadherins constitute a subfamily of nonclassic cadherins. PCDHGA8
is 1 of 22 tandemly arranged genes within the PCDHG gene cluster
(604968) on chromosome 5q31. The 22 PCDHG genes function as 'variable'
exons that are individually spliced to a downstream constant region to
form distinct PCDHG transcripts. The variable PCDHG exons encode the
extracellular and transmembrane domains of the protocadherin protein,
and the common region encodes the intracellular domain (Wu et al.,
2001). For further information on the PCDHG genes, see 604968.

CLONING

By PCR of a brain cDNA library, Wu and Maniatis (1999) cloned
full-length PCDHGA8.

By screening a brain cDNA library for genes with the potential to encode
large proteins, Nagase et al. (1997) identified a cDNA encoding PCDHGA8,
which they termed KIAA0327. The 820-amino acid protein was predicted to
be involved in cell signaling. RT-PCR analysis detected weak expression
in placenta and kidney.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the PCDHGA8
gene to chromosome 5. By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2001)
mapped the PCDHGA8 gene to chromosome 5q31, between the PCDHGB4 gene
(603058) and the PCDHGB5 gene (606302). They localized the mouse PCDHG
genes to chromosome 18c.

607991	TITLE *607991 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 8 (SODIUM-CALCIUM EXCHANGER), MEMBER 3; SLC8A3
;;SODIUM-CALCIUM EXCHANGER 3; NCX3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Plasma membrane sodium-calcium exchangers, such as SLC8A3, are
reversible transporters controlling Ca(2+) homeostasis. The forward
sodium-calcium exchange extrudes 1 Ca(2+) for 3 extracellular Na(+)
ions, using the Na(+) gradient and the electrical potential across the
plasma membrane as an energy source.

CLONING

Nicoll et al. (1996) cloned rat Slc8a3, which they designated Ncx3. The
deduced 927-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide, 11
transmembrane segments, a long cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane
segments 5 and 6, and alpha and beta repeat sequences characteristic of
exchange proteins. The authors predicted that the N terminus is
extracellular and the C terminus is intracellular. Slc8a3 contains 5
N-glycosylation sites and 4 phosphorylation sites. Northern blot
analysis of rat tissues detected a 6.0-kb transcript only in brain and
skeletal muscle.

By searching databases for sequences similar to rat Slc8a3, followed by
RT-PCR of neuroblastoma cell line total RNA, Gabellini et al. (2002)
cloned SLC8A3, which they designated NCX3. The deduced 921-amino acid
protein contains an N-terminal cluster of 5 transmembrane domains and a
C-terminal cluster of 5 transmembrane domains. The clusters are
separated by a large hydrophilic intracellular loop. Gabellini et al.
(2002) identified complex alternative splicing in the exons encoding the
intracellular loop. The form expressed in brain and the neuroblastoma
cell line has 7 of 9 exons, lacking exons 3 and 5. In addition to this
isoform, 2 other isoforms were expressed in skeletal muscle: one lacking
only exon 3, and the other lacking exons 3, 4, and 5, resulting in a
terminating frameshift. The predicted proteins range in size from 68 to
100 kD. The coding region of SLC8A3 shares 68% and 71% amino acid
identity with SLC8A1 (182305) and SLC8A2 (601901), respectively, and 97%
identity with rat Slc8a3.

GENE FUNCTION

Nicoll et al. (1996) determined that transfection of rat Slc8a3 into
baby hamster kidney cells mediated a 12-fold increase in Na(+)
gradient-dependent Ca(2+) uptake relative to control cells.

Using promoter-reporter constructs, Gabellini et al. (2002) found that
expression of the SLC8A3 promoter in neuroblastoma cells was promoted by
retinoic acid, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (113505), and rising
cAMP levels. Ca(2+) was inhibitory, and inhibition was mediated by CAMK2
(see 114078)-directed phosphorylation of CREB (see 123810).

GENE STRUCTURE

Gabellini et al. (2002) determined that the SLC8A3 gene contains 9 exons
and spans about 150 kb. Exon 1 is untranslated.

Gabellini et al. (2002) determined that the promoter region of SLC8A3
contains a TATA box and several GC boxes, indicating constitutive
transcription. It also includes binding sites for brain-specific AP2
(107580) transcription factor and for muscle-specific MyoD (159970),
GATA2 (137295), and GATA3 (131320).

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gabellini et al. (2002) mapped the SLC8A3
gene to chromosome 14q24.2. Nicoll et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Slc8a3
gene to chromosome 12.

ANIMAL MODEL

Sokolow et al. (2004) produced mice deficient in Ncx3. Ncx3-deficient
mice presented a skeletal muscle fiber necrosis and a defective
neuromuscular transmission, reflecting the absence of Ncx3 in the
sarcolemma of the muscle fibers and at the neuromuscular junction. The
defective neuromuscular transmission was characterized by the presence
of electromyographic abnormalities. The findings indicated that NCX3
plays an important role in vivo in the control of Ca(2+) concentrations
in skeletal muscle fibers and at the neuromuscular junction.

Molinaro et al. (2008) demonstrated that homozygous ablation of the Ncx3
gene in mice increased the extent of ischemic brain lesions after middle
cerebral artery occlusion, particularly in the temporoparietal cortex,
compared to controls. Cultured hippocampal cells from Ncx3-deficient
mice showed significantly increased cell death in response to oxygen
glucose deprivation compared to wildtype cells. Hypoxic conditions
increased the reverse mode of the transporter in wildtype cells, but
this reverse current was significantly decreased in Ncx3-deficient
cells. The findings indicated impaired Ca(2+) and Na(+) homeostasis
resulting from absence of Ncx3. Molinaro et al. (2008) noted that NCX3
activity is ATP-independent and can thus function normally even during
ischemic conditions, and suggested that wildtype Ncx3 may have
beneficial effects during hypoxic conditions by decreasing cellular
Na(+) content in the initial stages.

;;CALPAIN 4; CAPN4;;
CANPS;;
CALCIUM-DEPENDENT PROTEASE, SMALL SUBUNIT; CDPS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Calcium-dependent cysteine proteinases, or calpains (EC 3.4.22.17), are
widely distributed in mammalian cells. There are 2 distinct molecular
forms, calpains I and II, which differ in the quantity of calcium
required. Both calpains I and II are heterodimeric; each is composed of
1 heavy (about 80 kD), CAPN1 (114220) and CAPN2 (114230), respectively,
and 1 shared light (about 30 kD) subunit, CAPNS1. The heavy subunit has
a catalytic function, and the light subunit is regulatory.

CLONING

Ohno et al. (1986) gave the nucleotide sequence for a nearly full-length
cDNA coding for the small subunit of human calcium-dependent protease. A
human spleen cDNA library was the source. The human protein has 268
amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Using cell biologic, pharmacologic, and genetic methods,
Chandramohanadas et al. (2009) found that the apicomplexan parasites
Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agents of
malaria and toxoplasmosis, respectively, used host cell calpains to
facilitate parasite egress. Immunodepletion and inhibition experiments
showed that calpain-1 was required for escape of P. falciparum from
human erythrocytes. Similarly, elimination of both calpain-1 and
calpain-2 via small interfering RNA against the common regulatory
subunit CAPNS1 in human osteosarcoma cells or deletion of Capns1 in
mouse embryonic fibroblasts blocked egress of T. gondii.
Chandramohanadas et al. (2009) concluded that P. falciparum and T.
gondii both exploit host cell calpains to facilitate escape from
intracellular parasitophorous vacuoles and/or the host plasma membrane,
a process required for parasite proliferation.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Blanchard et al. (1997) reported the crystal structure of the
Ca(2+)-binding domain (domain VI) of rat Capns1 at 2.3-angstrom
resolution, both with and without bound Ca(2+). Monomers of domain VI
formed dimers with or without Ca(2+). The domain VI monomer was compact,
predominantly alpha helical, and incorporated 5 EF-hand supersecondary
structural elements. Only EF1, EF2, and EF3 were able to bind Ca(2+) at
physiologic Ca(2+) concentrations, and EF1 showed a novel Ca(2+)
coordination pattern.

MAPPING

By a combination of spot blot hybridization with sorted chromosomes and
of Southern hybridization with human-mouse cell hybrid DNAs, using in
each case a cDNA probe, Ohno et al. (1990) assigned the CANPS gene to
chromosome 19.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using targeted disruption of the mouse Capn4 gene and casein zymography
analysis, Arthur et al. (2000) demonstrated that wildtype and
heterozygote embryonic stem cell lysates maintained mu- and m-calpain
(i.e., calpain I and II) activities, whereas mutant homozygote embryonic
stem cell lysates did not. Immunoblot analysis showed that the m-calpain
large subunit was lost in Capn4 -/- cells. Growth of fibroblasts from
day 9.5 Capn4 -/- embryos was indistinguishable from those of wildtype
and heterozygous mice. At day 10.5, Capn4 -/- mice had a normal
cardiovascular system except for apparent defects in the development of
heart chambers and the vessels leading to and from the heart. After day
11.5, the accumulation of nucleated erythroid cells correlated with the
death of all Capn4 -/- embryos. Although unable to determine a
physiologic function for calpain, Arthur et al. (2000) concluded that
calpain is essential for life.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CYP2A6 gene encodes an enzyme (EC 1.14.14.1) that plays a major role
in the oxidation of nicotine and coumarin in human liver microsomes.
Polymorphisms in the CYP2A6 gene that affect enzyme activity and
susceptibility to lung cancer have been identified.

CLONING

Phillips et al. (1985) used a cDNA clone coding for a
phenobarbital-inducible cytochrome P-450 variant of rat liver microsomal
membranes as a probe to screen a human cDNA library. Restriction mapping
showed that 2 of the colonies isolated contained plasmids coding for
overlapping regions of the same cDNA sequence. The sequence showed
considerable homology to that of cytochrome P-450 isozymes isolated from
other species. The phenobarbital-inducible P-450 gene is a member of a
multigene family coded by human chromosome 19. Induction by
phenobarbital is mediated almost entirely at the level of transcription.

Yamano et al. (1989) isolated a human CYP2A3 cDNA from a liver cDNA
library. The human gene encodes a 448-amino acid polypeptide that is 85%
identical to the rat protein.

Yamano et al. (1990) isolated 2 cDNAs coding for P450s in the CYP2A gene
subfamily from a lambda-gt11 library prepared from human hepatic mRNA.
The 2 cDNAs differed by only 1 amino acid, leu160 to his (L160H;
122720.0001), and presumably represented alleles. Designated CYP2A3, the
gene was shown to be primarily responsible for coumarin 7-hydroxylase
activity in human liver. The level of expression of this activity varied
up to 40-fold among livers. Levels of mRNA also varied significantly,
and 3 specimens had no detectable mRNA. When the human CYP2A3 gene was
cloned, it was shown to encode IIA3, the enzyme for coumarin
7-hydroxylase (Yamano et al., 1990). Unfortunately, the CYP2A3
designation had already been taken for the rat gene, and it was
uncertain that the human gene was orthologous to the rat gene.
Therefore, the human IIA3 gene product is encoded by a gene designated
CYP2A6 (Nebert, 1994).

Fernandez-Salguero et al. (1995) cloned 3 complete CYP2A genes, CYP2A6,
CYP2A7 (608054), and CYP2A13 (608055), in addition to 2 pseudogenes
truncated after exon 5, located on 19q13.2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fernandez-Salguero et al. (1995) determined that the CYP2A6 gene
contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Davis et al. (1986) assigned P450PB to
19q13.1-q13.3. Shephard et al. (1985) used the same probe in Southern
analysis of DNA from human-rodent cell hybrids and likewise concluded
that the gene is located on chromosome 19. Mitchell et al. (1989)
concluded that the cluster of CYP2A, CYP2B, and CYP2F genes is distal to
the secretor locus (182100) on chromosome 19. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Trask et al. (1993) localized the CYP2A gene to 19q13.2.
By pulsed field gel electrophoresis, Miles et al. (1989) demonstrated
that the CYP2A and CYP2B genes lie within the same 350-kb genomic DNA
fragment.

Fernandez-Salguero et al. (1995) determined the structural organization
of the CYP2 gene cluster, which spans 350 kb on chromosome 19q13.2. They
also determined the directions of transcription.

The genes that correspond to PEPD (613230), GPI (172400), and P450PB on
human chromosome 19 are on mouse chromosome 7 (Matsunaga et al., 1990).
In the mouse, Coh, the gene for coumarin hydroxylase (a P-450 enzyme),
is closely linked to Gpi1, on proximal chromosome 7. Using a RFLP of the
CYP1 locus (CYP2 in the new nomenclature), Davis (1987) studied linkage
with the PEPD polymorphism. In males, a maximum lod score of 2.69 at
theta = 0.01 was observed. In mice, the homologous 2 loci are within 10
cM of each other on chromosome 7. Miles et al. (1989) discussed the
possibility that CYP2A rather than CYP2B is responsible for coumarin
hydroxylase activity in the mouse. Miles et al. (1990) demonstrated that
in the mouse Cyp2a is closely linked to Cyp2b (as are the homologous
genes in the human) and also to Coh, which, by biochemical evidence
(Negishi et al., 1989), is encoded by a member of the P450IIA gene
subfamily.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wood and Conney (1974) found that basal and phenobarbital-induced rates
of hepatic metabolism of coumarin to 7-hydroxycoumarin were markedly
higher in DBA-2J mice than in other strains. Intermediate activities in
hybrids indicated codominant inheritance. They predicted similar
variability in man. Kratz (1976) studied coumarin 7-hydroxylase activity
in liver obtained by needle biopsy. A 4-fold range was observed and
interpreted as genetic. Persons taking drugs that might induce enzyme
activity were excluded from the study.

Fernandez-Salguero et al. (1995) identified 3 different CYP2A6 alleles:
the functional CYP2A6 allele; variant-1 (v1), which has a single base
mutation (T to A) leading to a leu-to-his change in exon 3 (CYP2A6*2;
122720.0001); and v2, which is formed by gene conversion between the
wildtype CYP2A6 and CYP2A7 genes in exons 3, 6, and 8 (CYP2A6*3;
122720.0004). Nakajima et al. (1996) also identified 3 CYP2A6 alleles:
wildtype (CYP2A6*1) and 2 null, or inactive, alleles, CYP2A6*2 and
CYP2A6*3.

Nicotine is the primary compound in tobacco that establishes and
maintains tobacco dependence. Most of this nicotine is metabolized to
cotinine by the CYP2A6 enzyme. Pianezza et al. (1998) showed that
individuals lacking full functional CYP2A6 due to possession of null
alleles CYP2A6*2 (122720.0001) and/or CYP2A6*3 (122720.0004), who
therefore have impaired nicotine metabolism, are significantly protected
against becoming tobacco-dependent smokers. In addition, smokers whose
nicotine metabolism is thus impaired smoke significantly fewer
cigarettes than those with normal nicotine metabolism. Individuals
carrying CYP2A6-null alleles should have a decreased risk of developing
tobacco-related cancers and other medical complications because they
have a decreased risk of becoming a smoker and, if they do become
dependent, they smoke less than those with normal nicotine metabolism.
Since tobacco smoke contains nitrosamines that can be activated to
carcinogens by CYP2A6, individuals who carry CYP2A6-null alleles may
also be less efficient at activating tobacco smoke procarcinogens. These
3 factors may explain why there could be a reduction in tobacco-related
cancers for carriers of CYP2A6-null alleles. Pianezza et al. (1998)
found that among dependent smokers, the frequency of individuals with
impaired nicotine metabolism (carriers of 1 or 2 CYP2A6-null alleles)
was lower than in the control group (12.3% vs 19.6%). Even heterozygotes
for a null allele showed significant reduction in the risk of tobacco
dependence. CYP2A6 genotype may significantly affect nicotine levels
from sources other than cigarettes, e.g., nicotine-replacement therapies
for long-term maintenance against tobacco dependence and for treatment
of other syndromes such as Alzheimer disease (104300), and Tourette
syndrome (137580). The protective effect of CYP2A6-null alleles against
the risk of becoming tobacco-dependent and in decreasing consumption
suggests that inhibiting this enzyme may be a new way to help prevent
and treat tobacco smoking.

Sabol and Hamer (1999) attempted to replicate the findings of Pianezza
et al. (1998) by analyzing the CYP2A6 gene in a population of 385
individuals, using the same 2-step PCR assay described by Pianezza et
al. (1998). They found no association between genotype and either
smoking status or cigarette consumption. They then developed a
single-step PCR method that is specific for the CYP2A6 locus and
eliminated a high rate of false-positive mutations detected by the
2-step assay. Although this assay gave a much lower frequency of mutant
alleles, there was again no association of the CYP2A6 genotype with
smoking behavior.

Yokoi and Kamataki (1998) identified new mutations in the CYP2A6 and
CYP2D6 (124030) genes in Japanese subjects. Oscarson et al. (1999)
identified a deletion allele of CYP2A6 (122720.0002) which was rare in
Europeans but had a frequency of 15.1% among 96 Chinese subjects. In the
Chinese population, they detected no CYP2A6*2 alleles (122720.0001), in
contrast to the frequency of 11 to 20% previously reported by
Fernandez-Salguero et al. (1995).

In a study of 463 French adults, Gambier et al. (2005) found that
subjects homozygous for CYP2A6*1B, a allele characterized by gene
conversion in the 3-prime flanking region, smoked significantly more
cigarettes per day as compared to those homozygous for CYP2A6*1A
(wildtype), with a larger increase in their daily cigarette consumption
over a 5-year period. No significant difference of smoking versus
nonsmoking status was observed according to the CYP2A6 genotype.

Saito et al. (2003) provided a catalog of 680 variants among 8 CYP450
genes, 9 esterase genes, and 2 other genes in the Japanese population.

Mwenifumbo et al. (2008) characterized nonsynonymous CYP2A6 sequence
variants among 281 individuals of black African descent with respect to
their haplotype, allele frequency, and with in vivo CYP2A6 activity. The
cohort could be categorized into normal, intermediate, and slow nicotine
metabolism groups. In addition, alleles of individuals with unusual
phenotype-genotype relationships were sequenced, resulting in the
discovery of 5 novel uncharacterized alleles and at least 1 novel
duplication allele. A total of 7% of this population of black African
descent had at least one of the 8 novel characterized alleles, and 29%
had at least 1 previously established allele. The findings could aid in
the accuracy of association studies between CYP2A6 genotype and
behavioral, disease, or pharmacologic phenotypes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Paolini et al. (1999) found significant increases in the
carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes CYP1A1 (108330), CYP1A2 (124060), CYP3A
(124010), CYP2B (123930), and CYP2A in the lungs of rats supplemented
with high doses of beta-carotene. The authors suggested that
correspondingly high levels of CYPs in humans would predispose an
individual to cancer risk from the widely bioactivated tobacco-smoke
procarcinogens, thus explaining the cocarcinogenic effect of
beta-carotene in smokers.

GENE FAMILY

The cytochromes P-450 are among the major constituent proteins of the
liver mixed function monooxygenases. They play a central role in the
metabolism of steroids, the detoxification of drugs and xenobiotics, and
the activation of procarcinogens. Most phase I metabolism of drugs and
environmental pollutants is performed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes. In
this process 1 or more water-soluble groups (such as hydroxyl) are
introduced into the fat-soluble parent molecule, thereby rendering it
vulnerable to attack by the phase II conjugating enzymes. The increased
water-solubility of phase I and especially phase II products permits
ready excretion. Examples of drug-metabolizing processes that are
catalyzed by P-450 enzymes and show genetic variation include
4-hydroxylation of debrisoquine and N-oxidation of sparteine (see
124030). See review of Nebert and Gonzalez (1987).

Since the P450 superfamily is very ancient (the ancestral gene having
existed more than 3.5 billion years ago, at a time predating drugs,
animal-plant interactions, and combustion of organic matter), Nebert
(1991) proposed that the P450 enzymes, as well as other so called
'drug-metabolizing' enzymes, play an important role in maintaining the
steady-state levels of endogenous ligands involved in ligand-modulated
transcription of genes effecting homeostasis, growth, differentiation,
and neuroendocrine functions.

By December 14, 1992, Nelson et al. (1993) had accumulated a list of 221
P450 genes and 12 putative pseudogenes, representing 31 eukaryotes
(including 11 mammalian and 3 plant species) and 11 prokaryotes. Of 36
gene families described to that time, 12 families had been found in all
mammals examined. These 12 families comprised 22 mammalian subfamilies,
of which 17 and 15 had been mapped to specific chromosomal sites in the
human and mouse genomes, respectively. Each subfamily tend to be a
cluster of tightly linked genes; there are exceptions.

Nelson et al. (1996) gave an update on the sequences, gene mapping, and
nomenclature of the cytochrome P450 gene family.

Hoffman et al. (2001) reported the discovery of genes from 3 more CYP2
subfamilies inside the cluster of genes on chromosome 19 and assembled a
complete map of the region. They reviewed the organization, structure,
and expression of genes from all 6 subfamilies, and presented a general
hypothesis for the evolution of this complex gene cluster.

EVOLUTION

Within the mouse 2A subfamily, 2 P450s specifically catalyze either
steroid 15-alpha-hydroxylase or coumarin 7-hydroxylase activity; the
genes are designated Cyp2a-4 and Cyp2a-5, respectively. Aida et al.
(1994) found that, whereas Mus musculus domesticus strains contains both
genes, the wild mouse strain Mus spretus contains only Cyp2a-5.
Evolutionarily, therefore, Cyp2a-5 is ancestral to Cyp2a-4. Moreover,
the line to Cyp2a-4 descended as recently as 3 million years ago in an
ancestral mouse. The evidence implied a rapid evolution of the P450 gene
superfamily. The 2 genes are closely linked on mouse chromosome 7 (Lush
and Andrews, 1978). Lindberg et al. (1992) also found evidence that a
recent duplication in an ancestral mouse established a line of descent
from the ancestral coumarin 7-hydroxylase gene to the gene encoding
steroid 15-alpha-hydroxylase activity.

NOMENCLATURE

'Cytochrome' means literally 'colored substance in the cell.' The color
is derived from the subatomic properties of the iron in this
hemoprotein, and, indeed, cytochromes appear reddish when present in
sufficient concentration in the test-tube. 'P-450' denotes the unusual
property of having its major optical absorption peak (Soret maximum) at
about 450 nm, when the material has been reduced and combined with
carbon monoxide (Omura and Sato, 1964). The name P-450 was intended to
be temporary until more was known about the substance, but it has
persisted because an ever-increasing complexity has been found and no
agreement on a better nomenclature can be reached. It was the
recommendation of Nebert (1986) that the genes be symbolized CYP1, CYP2,
etc. It was further suggested (Nebert, 1986) that the dioxin-inducible
P450 coded by chromosome 15 be called CYP1 and that the P450 coded by
chromosome 19 be called CYP2A.

Nelson et al. (1993) noted that the Nomenclature Committee of the
International Union of Biochemistry prefers the term 'heme-thiolate
protein' instead of 'cytochrome' for P450 (Palmer and Reedijk, 1991).
The original term 'cytochrome P-450' is a holdover from the provisional
name given a protein by Sato and Omura (1961). These proteins are, in
fact, not cytochromes. For the gene and cDNA, Nelson et al. (1993)
recommended, as in the earlier reports from Nebert and his colleagues
(e.g., Nebert, 1991), that the root symbol be CYP for human and Cyp for
mouse, followed by an arabic number denoting the family, a letter
designating the subfamily (when 2 or more exist), and an arabic number
representing the individual gene within the subfamily. A hyphen should
precede the final number in mouse genes. 'P' ('p' in mouse) after the
gene number denotes a pseudogene. If a gene is a sole member of a
family, the subfamily letter and gene number need not be included. It
was recommended that the human nomenclature system be used for all
species other than the mouse.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COUMARIN, POOR METABOLISM OF
NICOTINE, POOR METABOLISM OF, INCLUDED;;
CYP2A6, V1;;
CYPA6*2
CYP2A6, LEU160HIS

Yamano et al. (1990) found a variant allele of the CYP2A6 gene that has
a single amino acid substitution (leu160 to his; L160H) and encodes an
unstable and catalytically inactive enzyme. PCR-based diagnostic
analysis of DNA from subjects that had been phenotyped for coumarin
7-hydroxylation verified that the variant-1 allele is unable to produce
a catalytically active enzyme. Fernandez-Salguero et al. (1995) found a
frequency of 15% for the variant-1 (v1) allele in Finns, with no alleles
of the v2 (122720.0004) type. In African Americans, no examples of the
CYP2A6 v1 allele was found among 40 alleles; the frequency of the v2
allele was 2.5%. Japanese had 20% v1 allele and 28% v2 allele. Taiwanese
had 11% v1 allele, and 6% v2 allele. If both the v1 and v2 alleles
encode a catalytically defective enzyme, the Japanese population would
be predicted to have a frequency of up to 10% of poor metabolizers of
coumarin (122700).

Hadidi et al. (1997) identified an individual who was homozygous for the
L160H substitution. On administration of coumarin (2 mg orally), no
detectable 7-hydroxycoumarin was excreted in the urine; rather,
approximately 50% of the dose was eliminated as 2-hydroxyphenylacetic
acid, the end product of coumarin 3-hydroxylation. His immediate family
members who were heterozygous for the CYP2A6*2 allele excreted little
2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and mainly 7-hydroxycoumarin, when similarly
tested. The authors suggested that persons homozygous for the CYP2A6*2
allele may constitute 1 to 25% of various populations.

Oscarson et al. (1998) found that the commonly used method for CYP2A6
genotyping gave erroneous results with respect to the coumarin
hydroxylase phenotype. They described an allele-specific PCR genotyping
method that identified the major defective CYP2A6 allele and accurately
predicted the phenotype. An allele frequency of 1 to 3% for CYP2A6*2 was
observed in Finnish, Spanish, and Swedish populations, much lower than
described previously. In a Chinese population, Oscarson et al. (1999)
did not detect any CYP2A6*2 alleles, in contrast to the frequency of 11
to 20% previously reported by Fernandez-Salguero et al. (1995).

Pianezza et al. (1998) demonstrated association of this allele, which
confers impaired nicotine metabolism, with a reduction in risk of
tobacco dependence (see 188890).

Following up on the report by Pianezza et al. (1998), London et al.
(1999) examined the association between the presence of a single CYP2A6
reduced activity allele (L160H) and lower prevalence of smoking among
460 persons enrolled in a case-control study of lung cancer in Los
Angeles County, California. Compared with subjects without a reduced
activity allele, those with 2 reduced activity alleles were slightly
overrepresented among those who had never smoked (p = 0.057). However,
in contrast to the finding of Pianezza et al. (1998), participants with
a single reduced activity allele were not less likely to smoke.
Furthermore, London et al. (1999) found no evidence that the presence of
reduced activity alleles decreased the usual number of cigarettes
consumed per day by smokers.

Gu et al. (2000) used long PCR followed by nested PCR to determine 3
CYP2A6 alleles (160L, 160H, and O). Adopting an approach to association
analysis originally developed to deal with null alleles implicit in ABO
blood group phenotyping, they tested the contribution of 160H
(functionally null) to reduced smoking habit, unconfounded by alleles
null to the long PCR. The most significant findings (p less than 0.01)
were that the possession of a 160H allele, compared with not possessing
a 160H allele, was associated with a mean age of starting regular
smoking 3 years later; and that the average likelihood of quitting
smoking at any time is 1.75 times greater for those possessing a 160H
allele compared with those who had no 160H allele. This suggested that a
smoking subject with a genotype predicted to confer 50% of the ability
to eliminate nicotine via the CYP2A6 pathway has almost twice the
likelihood of quitting smoking.

This variant was designated CYP2A6*2 by the Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP)
Allele Nomenclature Committee.

LUNG CANCER, PROTECTION AGAINST
CYP2A6*4A
CYP2A6, DEL

Oscarson et al. (1999) described the structure of a novel CYP2A 'locus'
where the CYP2A6 gene had been deleted, resulting in an abolished
CYP2A6-dependent metabolism. They proposed that this allele was
generated by an unequal crossover event between the 3-prime flanking
region of the CYP2A6 and CYP2A7 genes. Oscarson et al. (1999) developed
a rapid PCR-based method for the detection of the CYP2A6del allele and
found that it was present in only 1.0% of Finns and 0.5% of Spaniards.
They concluded that genotyping for the CYP2A6del allele is important in
studies correlating, for example, smoking behavior, precarcinogen
activation, or drug metabolism in the CYP2A6 genotype, in particular
when Oriental populations are investigated.

Miyamoto et al. (1999) studied the relationship between genetic
polymorphism of the CYP2A6 gene and lung cancer (211980) risk in a
case-control study of Japanese. They found that the frequency of
subjects homozygous for the CYP2A6 gene deletion, which causes lack of
the enzyme activity, was lower in the lung cancer patients than in the
healthy control subjects. These findings suggested that deficient CYP2A6
activity due to genetic polymorphism reduces lung cancer risk. Oscarson
et al. (1999) found that this deletion allele was rare in Europeans but
had a frequency of 15.1% among 96 Chinese subjects.

This variant was designated CYP2A6*4A by the Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP)
Allele Nomenclature Committee.

.0003
TEGAFUR, POOR METABOLISM OF
CYP2A6*11
CYP2A6, SER224PRO

In a clinical study, Daigo et al. (2002) orally administered the
anticancer drug tegafur to 5 gastric cancer (137215) patients. In 1
patient, the total area under the plasma concentration-time curve for
tegafur was 4-fold higher than in other patients. Daigo et al. (2002)
postulated that the poor metabolic phenotype in the patient was caused
by mutations of the CYP2A6 gene. By complete sequencing of the patient's
CYP2A6 genes, they found that 1 allele was deleted (122720.0002) and the
other contained a T-to-C transition of nucleotide 670 which caused a
ser224-to-pro (S224P) change. The V(max) value for tegafur metabolism by
the mutant CYP2A6 was approximately half the value of the intact CYP2A6,
although the K(m) values were nearly the same.

This variant was designated CYP2A6*11 by the Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP)
Allele Nomenclature Committee.

.0004
NICOTINE, POOR METABOLISM OF
CYP2A6*3;;
CYP2A6, V2
CYP2A6, GENE CONVERSION

Fernandez-Salguero et al. (1995) identified a null allele of the CYP2A6
gene formed by gene conversion between the wildtype CYP2A6 and CYP2A7
genes in exons 3, 6, and 8. They referred to this allele as variant-2
(v2). Fernandez-Salguero et al. (1995) found no alleles of the v2 type
among Finns. The frequency of the v2 allele among African Americans was
2.5%. Japanese had 28% v2 allele, and Taiwanese 6%. See 122720.0001 for
a comparison of the frequency of v1 and v2 alleles in different ethnic
groups.

Pianezza et al. (1998) demonstrated association of this allele, which
confers impaired nicotine metabolism, with a reduction in risk of
tobacco dependence (see 188890).

This allele was designated CYP2A6*3 by the Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP)
Allele Nomenclature Committee.

.0005
COUMARIN, POOR METABOLISM OF
CYP2A6*12A
CYP2A6, 10-AMINO ACID SUBSTITUTION

The CYP2A6 enzyme metabolizes certain drugs and precarcinogens and is
the most important enzyme for nicotine metabolism. More than 10
different allelic variants cause abolished or decreased enzyme activity.
Genetic polymorphism in this gene may be of particular importance for an
individual's need for nicotine and for susceptibility to lung and/or
liver cancer. The CYP2A6 gene is located adjacent to the inactive, very
similar CYP2A7 gene, and several allelic variants of CYP2A6 have been
created by unequal crossover and gene conversion reactions between these
genes. Oscarson et al. (2002) identified a novel CYP2A6 allele,
CYP2A6*12, which carries an unequal crossover between the CYP2A6 and
CYP2A7 genes in intron 2. This results in a hybrid allele where the
5-prime regulatory region and exons 1 and 2 are of CYP2A7 origin and
exons 3 through 9 are of CYP2A6 origin, resulting in 10 amino acid
substitutions compared to the CYP2A6*1 allele. Phenotyping with the
CYP2A6 substrate coumarin indicated that the CYP2A6*12 allele causes
reduced CYP2A6 activity in vivo. Furthermore, when expressed in
mammalian COS-1 cells, the enzyme variant catalyzed 7-hydroxylation of
coumarin at a rate approximately 60% that of the wildtype enzyme,
recapitulating a coumarin-resistant phenotype (122700). The CYP2A6*12
allele was present at an allele frequency of 2.2% among 92 unrelated
Spaniards, but was absent in 97 unrelated Chinese.

This allele was designated CYP2A6*12A by the Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP)
Allele Nomenclature Committee.

611504	TITLE *611504 CENTROMERIC PROTEIN O; CENPO
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CENPO is a subunit of a CENPH (605607)-CENPI (300065)-associated
centromeric complex that targets CENPA (117139) to centromeres and is
required for proper kinetochore function and mitotic progression (Okada
et al., 2006).

CLONING

Using the chicken Cenpo sequence, Okada et al. (2006) cloned human CENPO
from a HeLa cell cDNA library (Fukagawa, 2007). The deduced protein
contains 300 amino acids, and it has an apparent molecular mass of 33.8
kD by SDS-PAGE. Fluorescence-tagged CENPO localized to centromeres
throughout the cell cycle.

GENE FUNCTION

By mass spectrometric analysis of proteins that immunoprecipitated with
anti-CENPH and anti-CENPI antibodies in HeLa cells, Okada et al. (2006)
identified CENPO as a component of the CENPH-CENPI centromeric complex.
Deletion of Cenpo in a chicken B-cell line resulted in viable cells that
grew more slowly than controls; knockout of CENPO in HeLa cells also
reduced the rate of growth. Loss of CENPO in human and chicken cells did
not alter the localization of other CENPH-CENPI centromeric complex
components. Since cells deficient in CENPO were similar to those
deficient in CENPP (611505), CENPQ (611506), and CENP50 (MLF1IP;
611511), Okada et al. (2006) suggested that these proteins form an
accessory subcomplex within the CENPH-CENPI centromeric complex.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CENPO
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP D5S2617).

606091	TITLE *606091 SIALIC ACID-BINDING IMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE LECTIN 10; SIGLEC10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SIGLECs are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily that are expressed
on the cell surface. Most SIGLECs have 1 or more cytoplasmic immune
receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, or ITIMs. SIGLECs are
typically expressed on cells of the innate immune system, with the
exception of the B-cell expressed SIGLEC6 (604405).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences resembling CD33 (SIGLEC3;
159590) and screening a spleen cDNA library, Munday et al. (2001)
isolated a cDNA encoding SIGLEC10. Sequence analysis predicted that the
697-amino acid SIGLEC10 protein contains a signal peptide, an N-terminal
V-set Ig-like domain and 4 C2-set Ig-like domains, 5 potential N-linked
glycosylation sites, a transmembrane region, and a 126-residue
cytoplasmic tail with 3 putative ITIMs. Northern blot analysis detected
a major 3.0-kb SIGLEC10 transcript, with highest levels in spleen, lymph
node, blood leukocytes, and appendix. Little or no expression was
observed in pancreas, thyroid, and testis. Flow cytometric analysis
demonstrated eosinophil-specific expression of SIGLEC10, but at a lower
level than that of SIGLEC8 (605639). Expression was also detected on
monocytes and a CD16 (146740)-positive/CD56-negative natural killer-like
lymphocyte population. After sialidase treatment, which is necessary for
unmasking the sialic acid-binding site on SIGLECs interacting with cell
surface sialic acids, cells expressing SIGLEC10 bound to red blood
cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated expression of a 100- to
120-kD monomeric protein, higher than the predicted molecular mass,
suggesting that SIGLEC10 is glycosylated.

By random sequencing and by comparison with known SIGLEC sequences, Li
et al. (2001) independently cloned SIGLEC10 from a dendritic cell cDNA
library. The cDNA predicted a deduced 607-amino acid protein containing
3 C2-set domains and 3 putative N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot
analysis of multiple human tissues revealed a transcript of about 3.3 kb
in peripheral blood lymphocytes, ovary, and spleen, and a transcript of
about 1.8 kb in liver, spleen, thymus, and lung.

Using the positional candidate cloning approach, Yousef et al. (2001)
identified SIGLEC10 and found that it encodes 3 variants: a deduced
protein of 697 amino acids, a shorter variant missing exon 8, and a
variant with multiple combined exons including intronic sequences.
RT-PCR detected expression of SIGLEC10 primarily in bone marrow, spleen,
brain, small intestine, colon, and spinal cord.

GENE FUNCTION

With use of SIGLEC10-transfected COS-7 cells, Li et al. (2001) found
moderate red blood cell binding and rosette formation that was augmented
by sialidase pretreatment to eliminate sialylated (cis ligands) on the
COS-7 cell surface. With use of polyacrylamide glycoconjugates, they
determined that SIGLEC10 preferentially bound glycoconjugates carrying
sialic acid in either alpha-2,3 or alpha-2,6 linkages, similar to the
binding observed for SIGLEC5 (604200).

Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger (cell
injury)-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) both trigger activation of
the innate immune system. Chen et al. (2009) reported that Cd24
(600074)-deficient mice exhibit increased susceptibility to DAMPs but
not PAMPs. CD24 associates with high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1;
163905), heat shock protein-70 (HSP70; 140550), and heat shock
protein-90 (HSP90; 140571). CD24 negatively regulates their stimulatory
activity and inhibits nuclear factor kappa-B (see 164011) activation.
Chen et al. (2009) reported that this occurs at least in part through
CD24 association with SIGLEC10 in humans or SiglecG in mice. Chen et al.
(2009) concluded that the CD24-SiglecG pathway protects the host against
a lethal response to pathologic cell death and discriminates danger-
versus pathogen-associated molecular patterns.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yousef et al. (2001) determined that the SIGLEC10 gene contains 11 exons
and spans about 6.5 kb.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Munday et al. (2001) mapped the SIGLEC10 gene to 19q13.3,
where it is closely linked to other CD33-related SIGLECs. Yousef et al.
(2001) identified the SIGLEC10 gene on overlapping BAC clones localized
to chromosome 19q13.4. SIGLEC10 lies 278 kb telomeric to SIGLEC9
(605640) and 35 kb centromeric to SIGLEC8.

136836	TITLE *136836 FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE 6; FUT6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferases constitute a large family of
glycosyltransferases with a high degree of homology. The enzymes of this
family comprise 3 main activity patterns called myeloid, plasma, and
Lewis, based on their capacity to transfer alpha-L-fucose to distinct
oligosaccharide acceptors, their sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide
inhibition, their cation requirements, and their tissue-specific
expression patterns. The different categories of
alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferases are sequentially expressed during
embryo-fetal development. FUT6 encodes a 'plasma type' of
alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase (summary by Mollicone et al., 1994).

CLONING

Weston et al. (1992) isolated and cloned a novel
alpha(1,3)fucosyltransferase gene, which they designated FUT6, which
encodes a deduced 358-amino acid protein. FUT6 shares 85% and 89% amino
acid sequence identity with FUT3 (111100) and FUT5 (136835),
respectively, but differs substantially in its acceptor substrate
requirements.

Koszdin and Bowen (1992) amplified FUT6 by PCR of a squamous carcinoma
cell line and a myeloid leukemia cell line.

Cameron et al. (1995) studied the tissue distribution of FUT6 by RT-PCR,
RACE, and Northern blot analysis. They found that FUT6 was expressed at
high levels as a 3.5-kb transcript in kidney and liver and as a 2.5-kb
transcript in colon and liver. They identified alternate polyadenylation
sites as well as splice variants resulting in deletion of the catalytic
domain. By RT-PCR, Schnyder-Candrian et al. (2000) found FUT6 to be the
major fucosyltransferase of human umbilical vein endothelial cells.
Immunolocalization showed that FUT6 colocalizes with
beta-4-galactosyltransferase-1 (B4GALT1; 137060) in compact juxtanuclear
structures typical of the Golgi apparatus. Antibodies raised against
another epitope of FUT6 localized the enzyme to Weibel-Palade bodies,
endothelial storage granules.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNAs, Weston et al. (1992)
demonstrated that the FUT6 gene is located on chromosome 19, where the
Lewis blood group gene (FUT3; 111100) had long been known to be located.

McCurley et al. (1995) demonstrated that FUT5, FUT3, and FUT6 are
located in the 19p13.3 region in an interval of about 40 kb. They are
situated in close proximity and the direction of transcription of all 3
is toward the telomere. The organization may suggest coordinate
regulation.

GENE FUNCTION

Weston et al. (1992) found that when FUT6 was transfected into mammalian
cells, it was capable of directing expression of the Lewis x, sialyl
Lewis x, and difucosyl sialyl Lewis x epitopes.

Koszdin and Bowen (1992) also showed that transfection of FUT6 cDNA into
mammalian cells conferred alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase activity to the
cells, resulting in cell surface expression of Lewis x and sialyl Lewis
x carbohydrates.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Whereas most humans express an alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase in plasma,
9% of individuals on the isle of Java (Indonesia) do not express this
enzyme. The Lewis negative phenotype is found on red cells of 95% of
these FUT-deficient individuals, suggesting strong linkage
disequilibrium between these 2 traits. To define a molecular basis for
this plasma FUT deficiency (613852) and to determine which of 2
candidate human FUT genes, FUT5 (136835) and FUT6, encode this enzyme,
Mollicone et al. (1994) cloned and analyzed alleles at these 2 loci from
an Indonesian individual with fucosyltransferase deficiency. Single
basepair changes were identified in the coding region of each gene,
yielding 3 codon changes in FUT5 and 3 in FUT6. Only the changes in the
FUT6 alleles inactivated the gene when tested by expression in
transfected COS-1 cells. One of these inactivating changes was a
missense mutation (glu247-to-lys) within the enzyme's catalytic domain.
The other inactivating mutation, a nonsense tyr315-to-ter change,
truncated the C terminus of the enzyme by 45 amino acids. The
glu247-to-lys missense mutation was present in homozygous state in 9
plasma FUT-deficient individuals tested, whereas the nonsense mutation
at tyrosine-315 was present in homozygous state in only 1 of these 9
persons. These results demonstrated that the
alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase activity in human plasma is encoded by the
FUT6 gene and that the missense mutation within codon 247 of this gene
is responsible for the Indonesian deficiency of this activity.

Brinkman-Van der Linden et al. (1996) found that all individuals with a
homozygous gly739-to-ala FUT6 mutation showed no fucosylation of
alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The same result was found for
alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and alpha-1-protease inhibitor. On the other
hand, in all individuals with alpha-3-fucosyltransferase activity in the
plasma, alpha-3-fucosylated glycoforms of the glycoproteins studied were
found. Thus, their data suggested that the product of FUT6, but not of
FUT3 or of FUT5, is responsible for the alpha-3-fucosylation of
glycoproteins produced in liver and suggested that this organ is a major
source of alpha-3-fucosyltransferase activity in plasma.

Pang et al. (1999) sequenced the 1080-bp coding region of the FUT6 gene
in 161 individuals (322 chromosomes) drawn from 3 populations: 56
Africans (Xhosa), 52 European-Africans of South Africa, and 53 Japanese.
In addition to 6 base substitutions previously reported, 11 new base
substitutions and a single base insertion were found. They also
identified 11 functional and 4 null alleles, of which 10 were novel. The
allelic distributions of FUT6 were different among these 3 populations.
The heterozygosity of FUT6 was 0.860, 0.699, and 0.632 in the 3
populations, respectively. Pang et al. (1999) suggested that the
extensive DNA sequence diversity of FUT6 may make it suitable as a tool
in genetic studies of modern human evolution.

Java (Indonesia).

;;RAB GDP-DISSOCIATION INHIBITOR, ALPHA; RABGDIA;;
RAB GDI-ALPHA;;

OLIGOPHRENIN 2; OPHN2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The GDP dissociation inhibitor-1 gene (GDI1) regulates the GDP-GTP
exchange reaction of members of the rab family, small GTP-binding
proteins of the ras superfamily, that are involved in vesicular
trafficking of molecules between cellular organelles. The rab proteins
undergo activation upon GTP binding, and GTP hydrolysis to GDP
inactivates the protein. GDI proteins slow the rate of dissociation of
GDP from rab proteins and release GDP from membrane-bound rabs (Bachner
et al., 1995).

Chelly (1999) referred to the protein as oligophrenin-2 (OPHN2).

CLONING

Matsui et al. (1990) cloned a bovine GDI gene, designated smg p25A,
using an oligomer probe based on partial amino acid sequence. The
447-amino acid protein was expressed in E. coli and shown to have GDI
activity. Sedlacek et al. (1994) noted 2 rat rab GDI sequences,
designated alpha and beta, in the EMBL database (accession nos. X74401
and X74402).

Sedlacek et al. (1993) characterized a human rab GDI1 locus, which they
called XAP-4. The predicted amino acid sequence of the protein is 98.4%
identical to the bovine and rat GDI-alphas and 86.5% identical to human
rab GDI-beta (GDI2; 600767). The rab GDI-alpha gene was expressed at
highest levels as a 2.5-kb mRNA in brain, with lesser amounts in the
muscle and kidney. Subsequent work by Bachner et al. (1995) showed
expression predominantly in neural and sensory tissues.

D'Adamo et al. (1997) noted that GDI is expressed in all parts of the
adult brain and, by in situ hybridization analysis, it is detectable in
post-mitotic neural cells during mouse development, with the same timing
and in the same cell types as Rab3a.

Shisheva et al. (1994) cloned and characterized the mouse gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Rab GTPases regulate vesicle trafficking in eukaryotic cells by
reversibly associating with lipid membranes. Inactive Rab GTPases are
maintained in the cytosol by binding to GDP-dissociation inhibitor. It
is believed that specialized proteins are required to displace GDI from
Rab GTPases before Rab activation by GDP-GTP exchange factors (GEFs).
Machner and Isberg (2007) found that SidM from Legionella pneumophila
could act as both GEF and GDI-displacement factor (GDF) for Rab1
(179508). Rab1 released from GDI was inserted into liposomal membranes
and was used as a substrate for SidM-mediated nucleotide exchange.
During host cell infection, recruitment of Rab1 to Legionella-containing
vacuoles depended on the GDF activity of SidM. Thus, Machner and Isberg
(2007) concluded that GDF and GEF activity can be promoted by a single
protein, and GDF activity can coordinate Rab1 recruitment from the
GDI-bound pool.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sedlacek et al. (1994) characterized the human RABGDIA gene, which has
11 exons in a span of about 7 kb.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Hoffman et al. (2000) determined the 2.6-angstrom x-ray crystallographic
structure of the GTP-binding protein CDC42 (116952) in complex with
GDI1. The structure revealed 2 important sites of interaction between
GDI1 and CDC42. First, the N-terminal regulatory arm of GDI1 binds to
the switch I and II domains of CDC42, leading to inhibition of both GDP
dissociation and GTP hydrolysis. Second, the geranylgeranyl moiety of
CDC42 inserts into a hydrophobic pocket within the immunoglobulin-like
domain of the GDI1 molecule, leading to membrane release. The structural
data demonstrated how GDIs serve as negative regulators of small
GTP-binding proteins and how the isoprenoid moiety is utilized in this
critical regulatory interaction.

Rak et al. (2003) used a combination of chemical synthesis and protein
engineering to generate and crystallize the monoprenylated YPT1-RABGDI
complex. The structure of this complex was determined to 1.5-angstrom
resolution and provided a structural basis for the ability of RABGDI to
inhibit nucleotide release by RAB proteins. Isoprenoid binding requires
a conformational change that opens a cavity in the hydrophobic core of
its domain II. Analysis of the structure provided a molecular basis for
understanding a RABGDI mutant that causes mental retardation.

MAPPING

Sedlacek et al. (1993) localized a human rab GDI locus, which they
called XAP-4, near G6PD (305900) on chromosome Xq28. Sedlacek et al.
(1994) found that RABGDIA is present in a gene-dense region of Xq28 with
at least 8 other loci in the interval (approximately 220 kb) between QM
(RPL10; 312173) and G6PD.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

D'Adamo et al. (1997,1998) demonstrated unique mutations in the RABGDIA
gene in affected members of the MRX41 family (300104.0001) reported by
Hamel et al. (1996) and the MRX48 family (300104.0002) reported by des
Portes et al. (1997).

Bienvenu et al. (1998) carried out mutation screening of the whole
coding region of the GDI1 gene, using a combination of denaturing
gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing, in 164 patients
found negative for expansions across the FRAXA GCC repeat (309550.0004).
The authors identified a novel missense mutation in exon 11 of the GDI1
gene (300104.0003) in a family with nonspecific mental retardation. In
this large French family, all affected males showed moderate to severe
mental retardation. X-linked semidominant inheritance was strongly
suggested by the severe phenotypes in males in comparison to mildly
affected females or unaffected obligate carriers. The study suggested
that the prevalence of GDI1 mutations in nonspecific mental retardation
may be 0.5 to 1%.

Vandewalle et al. (2009) demonstrated a novel X-linked mental
retardation syndrome due to recurrent copy number gain of Xq28
specifically involving the GDI1 gene. Tiling Xq28 region-specific oligo
array revealed that all aberrations started at the beginning of the low
copy repeat LCR-K1 at position 153.20 Mb and ended just distal to LCR-L2
at 153.54 Mb. The copy number gain always included 18 annotated genes,
of which RPL10 (312173), ATP6AP1 (300197), and GDI1 are highly expressed
in brain. Of these, Vandewalle et al. (2009) considered GDI1 the most
likely candidate. Its copy number correlated with the severity of
clinical features: it was duplicated in a family with nonsyndromic
moderate mental retardation, triplicated in males from 2 families with
mild mental retardation and additional features, and present in 5 copies
in a family with a severe syndromic form of mental retardation.
Expression analysis showed copy number-dependent increased mRNA levels
in affected patients compared to control individuals. Interestingly,
analysis of the breakpoint regions suggested a recombination mechanism
that involves 2 adjacent but different sets of low copy repeats.

EVOLUTION

Human evolution is characterized by a dramatic increase in brain size
and complexity. To probe its genetic basis, Dorus et al. (2004) examined
the evolution of genes involved in diverse aspects of nervous system
biology. These genes, including GDI1, displayed significantly higher
rates of protein evolution in primates than in rodents. This trend was
most pronounced for the subset of genes implicated in nervous system
development. Moreover, within primates, the acceleration of protein
evolution was most prominent in the lineage leading from ancestral
primates to humans. Dorus et al. (2004) concluded that the phenotypic
evolution of the human nervous system has a salient molecular correlate,
i.e., accelerated evolution of the underlying genes, particularly those
linked to nervous system development.

ANIMAL MODEL

D'Adamo et al. (2002) reported the cognitive and behavioral
characteristics of mice carrying a deletion of Gdi1. The Gdi1-deficient
mice were fertile and anatomically normal, and exhibited normal spatial
and episodic memory and emotional behavior. However, they were impaired
in tasks requiring formation of short-term temporal associations,
suggesting a defect in short-term memory. In addition, they showed
lowered aggression and altered social behavior. In mice, as in humans,
lack of Gdi1 spared most central nervous system functions and
preferentially impaired only a few forebrain functions required to form
temporal associations.

Using electron microscopy and electrophysiology, Bianchi et al. (2009)
reported that lack of Gdi1 in mice impaired several steps in synaptic
vesicle (SV) biogenesis and recycling in the hippocampus. Alteration of
the SV reserve pool and a 50% reduction in the total number of SVs in
adult synapses may be dependent on a defective endosomal-dependent
recycling and may lead to the observed alterations in short-term
plasticity. The short-term memory deficit in mutant mice, observed when
using fear-conditioning protocols with short intervals between trials,
disappeared when Gdi1-mutant mice were allowed to have longer intervals
between sessions. Deficits in radial maze learning could also be
corrected by providing less challenging pretraining. Bianchi et al.
(2009) hypothesized that an intact reserve pool of synaptic vesicles is
necessary for memory processing under challenging conditions in mice.

In the family reported by Hamel et al. (1996) with X-linked nonspecific
mental retardation linked to Xq28 (MRX41; 300849), D'Adamo et al. (1997)
identified a T-to-C transition in the GDI1 cDNA, resulting in a
leu92-to-pro (L92P) substitution.

In affected members of the MRX48 (300849) family reported by Des Portes
et al. (1997), D'Adamo et al. (1997) identified a 366C-T transition in
the GDI1 gene, resulting in an arg70-to-ter (R70X) substitution. D'Adamo
et al. (1998) speculated that the truncated message could lead to
synthesis of a peptide of 69 amino acids, which would likely be unstable
and degraded. Moderate to severe mental retardation was found in 7 males
and milder intellectual impairment in 2 females, without any specific
clinical, radiologic, or biologic features.

gene, resulting in an arg423-to-pro (R423P) substitution.

In affected members of a multigenerational German family in which 9
males had nonsyndromic X-linked mental retardation (300849),
Strobl-Wildemann et al. (2011) identified a 2-bp deletion (1185delAG) in
exon 10 of the GDI1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination. The proband was noted to have absence seizures at age 12, a
small pointed chin, and crowded teeth, but major dysmorphic features
were not present and no other patients had dysmorphic features. Two of 4
female carriers had learning disabilities, and 1 also had
attention-deficit disorder.

612466	TITLE *612466 GUANYLATE-BINDING PROTEIN 4; GBP4
;;GUANYLATE-BINDING PROTEIN 3, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Guanylate-binding proteins, such as GBP4, are induced by interferon and
hydrolyze GTP to both GDP and GMP (Vestal, 2005).

CLONING

Vestal (2005) reported that the 642-amino acid GBP4 protein shares 50 to
55% identity with GBP1 (600411), GBP2 (600412), and GBP5 (611467). GBP4
contains a GTP-binding domain, but it lacks a C-terminal CaaX
isoprenylation motif found in the other 3 GBPs.

Olszewski et al. (2006) found that GBP4 shares 74% and 81% amino acid
identity with GBP6 (612467) and GBP7 (612468), respectively. All GBPs,
including GBP4, have a conserved N-terminal globular GTP-binding domain
containing 2 consensus sequences and a third T(L/V)RD sequence not found
in other GTPases. GBP4 has a unique 15-amino acid group at its N
terminus that is not found in other GBPs. EST database analysis
indicated wide expression of GBP4 in human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RT-PCR, Tripal et al. (2007) detected expression of GBP4 in
endothelial cells after stimulation with IFNG (147570), but not after
stimulation with TNF (191160) or IL1B (147720). Immunofluorescence
analysis demonstrated nucleocytoplasmic expression of GBP4.

GENE STRUCTURE

Olszewski et al. (2006) determined that the GBP4 gene contains 11 exons,
like other GBPs. However, unlike other GBPs, translation of GBP4 begins
in exon 1 rather than exon 2.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Olszewski et al. (2006) mapped the GBP4
gene to the GBP gene cluster on chromosome 1p22.2. It is located
telomeric to GBP5 and centromeric to GBP7.

605758	TITLE *605758 ANKYRIN REPEAT- AND SOCS BOX-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; ASB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteins of the ASB family, such as ASB1, contain central tandem ankyrin
(see 612641) repeats and a C-terminal suppressor of cytokine signaling
(SOCS) box. SOCS box proteins are predicted to be involved in protein
degradation by acting as a bridge between substrate proteins and E3
ubiquitin protein ligases (see 601623) (review by Kile et al., 2002).

CLONING

By EST database searching, probing a mouse spleen cDNA library, and
further database searching, Kile et al. (2000) identified a cDNA
encoding ASB1, which is identical to the KIAA1146 gene identified by
Hirosawa et al. (1999). Sequence analysis predicted that the 335-amino
acid protein, which is 94% identical to the mouse protein, contains 6
ankyrin repeats and a C-terminal SOCS box. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues revealed wide expression of a 5.5-kb transcript, with
highest expression in testis, spleen, and bone marrow.

GENE FUNCTION

Kohroki et al. (2005) found that epitope-tagged ASB1 and several other
ASB family members interacted with endogenous CUL5 (601741) and RBX2
(RNF7; 603863) in immunoprecipitated HEK293 cells. The ASB proteins did
not interact with CUL2 (603135) or RBX1 (603814). ASB1-CUL5-RBX2
complexes showed E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hirosawa et al. (1999) determined by genomic sequence analysis that the
ASB1 gene contains at least 5 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hirosawa et al. (1999) mapped the ASB1
gene, which they called KIAA1146, to chromosome 2. Kile et al. (2000)
mapped the mouse Asb1 gene between the markers D1Mit10 and D1Mit84.

Hartz (2013) mapped the ASB1 gene to chromosome 2q37.3 based on an
alignment of the ASB1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF156777) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Kile et al. (2001) found that Asb1 -/- mice were born at the expected
mendelian ratio. Asb1 -/- mice developed normally and appeared healthy,
and both male and female Asb1 -/- mice were fertile. However, male Asb1
-/- mice showed minor testicular dysmorphology and possibly thickening
of the epithelial layer of skin. Widespread overexpression of Asb1 in
mouse had no apparent deleterious effects.

(314850), which is a putative membrane transporter and a component of
the XK/Kell complex of the Kell blood group system (110900) (Calenda et
al., 2006).

CLONING

By nested PCR of a human placenta cDNA library, Calenda et al. (2006)
cloned XKRX, which they called XPLAC. The deduced 462-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of 53.6 kD and contains 10 predicted
transmembrane regions with a large second exoplasmic loop, consistent
with the XK family structure. XKRX has 1 predicted N-glycosylation site,
17 possible phosphorylation sites, and a cysteine residue, cys392, in
the fifth exoplasmic loop that is conserved with a similar XK cys
residue that forms a disulfide bond with the Kell protein. XKRX shares
37% and 45% amino acid identity with XK and XKR3, respectively. Northern
blot analysis of human tissues detected a 3.0-kb transcript with strong
expression in placenta and lower levels in adrenal gland, trachea, and
bone marrow, with a minor 3.3-kb transcript detected in adrenal gland
and trachea. XKRX expressed in COS-1 cells localized to the cell
surface. XKRX had an experimental molecular mass of 42 kD, smaller than
the predicted size, which may be due to XKRX hydrophobicity.
Immunohistochemistry studies detected XKRX protein in human placenta
trophoblasts. RT-PCR analysis detected XKRX expression in BeWo, a cell
line of trophoblast origin, and confocal microscopy localized XKRX to
the cell surface of BeWo cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Calenda et al. (2006) determined that the XKRX gene contains 3 exons
spanning 15.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Calenda et al. (2006) mapped the XKRX gene
to chromosome Xq22.1.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The human BCS1L gene encodes a homolog of S. cerevisiae bcs1 protein
involved in the assembly of complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory
chain.

CLONING

The S. cerevisiae bcs1 protein is a constituent of the inner
mitochondrial membrane and is required for the expression of functional
ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase (bc1) complex (see 191328). The bcs1
protein shares sequence similarity with members of the AAA (ATPases
associated with various cellular activities) superfamily (see 601681).
By searching an EST database for sequences related to bcs1, Petruzzella
et al. (1998) identified a cDNA encoding human BCS1L (BCS1-like). The
predicted 420-amino acid human protein is 50% identical to yeast bcs1
and, like bcs1, contains 2 conserved nucleotide-binding motifs. Although
BCS1L does not contain an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence,
in vitro mitochondrial import and trypsin-protection assays demonstrated
that it is imported into mitochondria. Northern blot analysis revealed
that BCS1L is expressed ubiquitously as a 1.4-kb mRNA. The authors also
detected a 4.5-kb transcript that they considered to be either an
alternative BCS1L mRNA or an mRNA derived from a related gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Found within the inner mitochondrial membrane, BCS1L is presumed to
facilitate insertion of Rieske Fe/S protein into precursors to complex
III during assembly of the respiratory chain (Cruciat et al., 1999).
Complex III then becomes assembled with complexes IV and I into a
respirasome supercomplex that facilitates the electron transfer required
for the synthesis of ATP.

MAPPING

Based on sequence similarity to ESTs, Petruzzella et al. (1998)
tentatively mapped the BCS1L gene to 2q33.

GENE STRUCTURE

De Lonlay et al. (2001) showed that the BCS1L gene consists of 7 exons.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Mitochondrial Complex III Deficiency, Nuclear Type 1

De Lonlay et al. (2001) found 4 biallelic mutations in the BCS1L gene in
6 patients from 4 families with mitochondrial complex III deficiency
nuclear type 1 (MC3DN1; 124000) characterized by neonatal proximal
tubulopathy, hepatic involvement, and encephalopathy. Complementation
studies in yeast confirmed the deleterious effect of these missense
mutations. De Lonlay et al. (2001) suggested that mutation of BCS1L is a
frequent cause of complex III deficiency, as one-third of their Turkish
patients had mutations in the BSC1L gene. De Lonlay et al. (2001)
reported that they had not been able to detect BCS1L mutations in
complex III-deficient patients with clinical presentations other than
neonatal tubulopathy with hepatic involvement and encephalopathy.

- GRACILE Syndrome

The GRACILE (growth retardation, amino aciduria, cholestasis, iron
overload, lactic acidosis, and early death) syndrome (603358) belongs to
the disease heritage of Finland. All affected families carry the same
ancestral haplotype on 2q33-q37, indicating 1 founder mutation (Visapaa
et al., 1998). Visapaa et al. (2002) identified a homozygous
ser78-to-gly mutation (S78G; 603358.0005) in the BCS1L gene in all
Finnish patients with GRACILE syndrome studied. In addition, they
identified 5 different mutations in the BCS1L gene in 3 British infants,
previously reported by Morris et al. (1995), whose symptoms resembled
those in GRACILE syndrome but who also had complex III deficiency and
neurologic symptoms. The phenotype of the Turkish patients in whom de
Lonlay et al. (2001) demonstrated mutations in the BCS1L gene was
distinctly different from that of the Finnish patients. Whereas the
Turkish patients had complex III deficiency, the Finnish patients had
complex III activity within the normal range. The Finnish patients had
no neurologic problems, but had marked hepatic iron overload, associated
with abnormal levels of proteins involved in iron transfer and storage,
and free plasma iron. These findings implied that BCS1L has another
cellular function that is uncharacterized but essential, and that it is
putatively involved in iron metabolism.

- Bjornstad Syndrome

Bjornstad syndrome (262000) is an autosomal recessive condition
characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and pili torti. Lubianca
Neto et al. (1998) mapped the Bjornstad syndrome locus to 2q34-q36.
Hinson et al. (2007) refined the map location of the disorder to 2q35
and demonstrated mutations in the BCS1L gene (e.g., 603647.0001).

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

To understand how BCS2L mutations cause such widely different clinical
phenotypes, Hinson et al. (2007) considered the locations of defects on
the BCS1L protein structure and compared the function of mutant BCS1L in
yeast and in human lymphocytes. Their studies showed that all BCS1L
mutations disrupted the assembly of mitochondrial respirasomes (the
basic unit of respiration in human mitochondria), but the clinical
severity of the mutations was correlated with the production of reactive
oxygen species. The data indicated that in addition to mitochondrial
heteroplasmy and variable energy requirements of tissues,
tissue-specific sensitivities to reactive oxygen species contribute to
the variability of the manifestations of mitochondrial defects.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, SER277ASN

In 2 affected sibs and 1 fetus in a consanguineous family with
mitochondrial complex III deficiency nuclear type 1 (MC3DN1; 124000)
characterized by neonatal tubulopathy, encephalopathy, and liver
failure, de Lonlay et al. (2001) identified a homozygous 830G-A
transition in the BCS1L gene, resulting in a ser277-to-asp (S277N)
substitution.

.0002
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY
BCS1L, PRO99LEU

In 2 patients with complex III deficiency (124000), a boy and a girl,
born to unrelated consanguineous families, de Lonlay et al. (2001)
identified the same homozygous C-to-T transition at nucleotide 296 in
exon 1 of the BCS1L gene, causing the substitution of a leucine for a
highly conserved proline at codon 99 (P99L). The patients had metabolic
acidosis, hepatic involvement, neurologic deterioration, and brainstem
and basal ganglia lesions consistent with a diagnosis of Leigh syndrome
(256000). One patient had abnormal ventilation patterns and proximal
renal tubulopathy.

.0003
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, ARG155PRO

In a boy of Turkish origin with complex III deficiency (124000) born to
nonconsanguineous parents, de Lonlay et al. (2001) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the BCS1L gene: a 464C-G transversion
in exon 3 of the BCS1L gene, resulting in an arg155-to-pro (R155P)
substitution, and a 1057G-A transition in exon 7, resulting in a
val353-to-met (V353M; 603647.0004) substitution.

.0005
GRACILE SYNDROME
BCS1L, SER78GLY

Visapaa et al. (2002) reported that all GRACILE syndrome (603358)
patients in Finland were homozygous for a 232A-G mutation in exon 2 of
the BCS1L gene, resulting in a ser78-to-gly (S78G) substitution. Unlike
the Turkish patients reported by de Lonlay et al. (2001), the Finnish
patients had normal complex III activity and no neurologic problems, but
did have marked iron overload.

.0006
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, ARG45CYS

In 2 Spanish sibs with fatal infantile complex III deficiency (124000),
De Meirleir et al. (2003) identified compound heterozygosity for
mutation in the BCS1L gene: a 246C-T transition in exon 1, resulting in
an arg45-to-cys (R45C) substitution, and a 279C-T transition in exon 1,
resulting in an arg56-to-ter (R56X; 603647.0007) substitution. The R45C
substitution occurs in a crucial targeting signal of the gene and is
predicted to interfere with proper protein functioning. Each parent was
heterozygous for 1 of the mutations. Both patients had severe metabolic
acidosis noted shortly after birth, as well as severe liver dysfunction
and a renal tubulopathy. One died at age 3 weeks of lactic acidosis. The
second infant also had obvious neurologic involvement, with delayed
myelination, axial hypotonia, and developmental delay. He died at age 3
months. Postmortem liver examination of both infants showed liver
fibrosis, severe cholestasis, and hepatosiderosis with accumulation of
iron in aggregates of macrophages and in Kupffer cells. Mitochondria
appeared enlarged with few or no cristae and a fluffy matrix. De
Meirleir et al. (2003) suggested that the iron accumulation could be
explained by the lack of incorporation of iron in the iron-sulfur
cluster of complex III.

Ramos-Arroyo et al. (2009) reported another Spanish infant with the R45C
and R56X mutations. She presented with neonatal severe hypotonia, food
intolerance, and vomiting. She soon developed a proximal renal
tubulopathy with glucosuria, phosphaturia, and aminoaciduria, metabolic
lactic acidosis, and hepatic involvement. Bilateral cataracts were also
noted. At age 4 months, she showed nystagmus, hypertonia, microcephaly,
developmental delay, and failure to thrive. Her neurologic condition and
metabolic acidosis worsened rapidly, and she died at 6 months of age.
Biochemical studies of muscle tissue showed impaired activity of
mitochondrial complex III. Ramos-Arroyo et al. (2009) noted that this
child did not have evidence of altered iron metabolism, as had been
observed in the patients reported by De Meirleir et al. (2003), and as
has been observed in patients with the allelic disorder GRACILE syndrome
(603358). Ramos-Arroyo et al. (2009) postulated that phenotypic
variability even in individuals with the same BCS1L genotype may reflect
tissue-specific expression of the mutant gene.

BJORNSTAD SYNDROME
BCS1L, ARG183HIS

In affected members of the family with Bjornstad syndrome (262000) in
which Lubianca Neto et al. (1998) demonstrated linkage to 2q, Hinson et
al. (2007) identified homozygosity for a C-to-T transition in the BCS1L
gene, resulting in an arg183-to-his (R183H) substitution. Eight
individuals in 2 sibships related as first cousins once removed were
affected; the parents in each case were consanguineous.

.0009
BJORNSTAD SYNDROME WITH MILD MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1, INCLUDED
BCS1L, ARG184CYS

In a sporadic case of Bjornstad syndrome (262000) with mild
mitochondrial complex III deficiency (124000), Hinson et al. (2007)
found compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in the BCS1L
gene: arg184 to cys (R184C) and gly35 to arg (G35R; 603647.0010).

In a Moroccan girl with mitochondrial complex III deficiency (124000),
Fernandez-Vizarra et al. (2007) identified compound heterozygosity for
the R184C mutation and a 547C-T transition in exon 3 of the BCS1L gene,
resulting in an arg183-to-cys (R183C; 603647.0012) substitution. She
presented at age 9 months with acute psychomotor regression, hypotonia,
and failure to thrive, which progressed to spastic quadriparesis and
mental retardation associated with abnormal signal intensities in the
thalami, basal ganglia, and periventricular white matter, consistent
with an encephalopathy. Heart, liver, and kidneys were apparently
unaffected, but she was also noted to have brittle hair. Studies in
yeast showed that both mutations significantly reduced mitochondrial
cytochrome content and respiratory activity, as well as caused a
decreased incorporation of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (UQCRFS1;
191327) into complex III. Further studies showed decreased levels of
fully assembled complex III. The findings suggested that BCS1L is
necessary for proper complex III assembly.

MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, THR50ALA

In a 4-year-old Spanish boy with isolated mitochondrial complex III
deficiency (124000), Blazquez et al. (2009) identified a homozygous
148A-G transition in exon 1 of the BCS1L gene, resulting in a
thr50-to-ala (T50A) substitution in the mitochondrial sorting sequence.
He presented at 6 months of age with psychomotor retardation, failure to
thrive, hypotonia, lactic acidosis, and hepatic dysfunction. Physical
examination showed unstable head support, poor eye fixation, coarse
facies, and epicanthus. There was hypertrichosis of the frontal head
zone and limbs, and excessive fat distribution in the upper back, neck,
hands and feet, with almost no fat on the limbs. Respiratory chain
activity in muscle and fibroblasts showed an isolated complex III defect
(58% of normal in muscle, 93% in fibroblasts). At age 4 years, he still
showed psychomotor retardation, had developed mild sensorineural hearing
loss, and persistent lactic acidemia, but renal function, hair, and iron
metabolism were normal. Brain MRI was normal. The mutation was not found
in 400 control alleles, and each unaffected parent was heterozygous for
the mutation.

HEPATOCYTE NUCLEAR FACTOR 6-ALPHA; HNF6A;;
HEPATOCYTE NUCLEAR FACTOR 6; HNF6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tissue-specific transcription is regulated in part by cell
type-restricted proteins that bind to defined sequences in target genes.
The DNA-binding domain of these proteins is often evolutionarily
conserved; on this basis, liver-enriched transcription factors have been
classified into various families. See, for example, HNF3A (602294) and
HNF1A (142410). Lemaigre et al. (1996) isolated from rat liver a
transcription factor, which they called hepatocyte nuclear factor-6,
that contains 2 different DNA-binding domains: a novel type of
homeodomain, and a homolog of the Drosophila cut domain. A similar
bipartite sequence had been found only in the genome of Caenorhabditis
elegans. The HNF6 cDNA encodes a deduced protein of 465 amino acids. By
RNase protection assay, the expression of HNF6 was found to be highest
in liver, but was also detectable in brain, spleen, and testis.

GENE FUNCTION

By RT-PCR, Jacquemin et al. (1999) determined the tissue distribution of
ONECUT1 in 12 human tissues. They found strong ONECUT1 expression in
liver and lower expression in testis and skin.

Vaisse et al. (1997) found that all members of the HNF3 family as well
as HNF4G (605966) and HNF6 are expressed in pancreatic beta cells. They
also identified and characterized simple tandem repeat DNA polymorphisms
in all of these genes.

Samadani and Costa (1996) determined that HNF6 activates transcription
of the promoters of HNF3B (600288) and TTR (176300). Further studies
suggested that HNF6 is important not only for the regulation of a wide
variety of genes expressed in hepatocytes and, putatively, intestinal
epithelium, but also for the inception of gut endoderm-derived organs
via activation of the HNF3B protein.

Glucocorticoids exert their effects on gene transcription through
ubiquitous receptors that bind to regulatory sequences present in many
genes. These glucocorticoid receptors are present in all cell types, yet
glucocorticoid action is controlled in a tissue-specific way. The
mechanism for this control relies on tissue-specific transcriptional
activators that bind in the vicinity of the glucocorticoid receptor and
are required for receptor action. Pierreux et al. (1999) described a
gene-specific and tissue-specific inhibitory mechanism through which
glucocorticoid action is repressed by a tissue-restricted transcription
factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor-6. HNF6 inhibits the
glucocorticoid-induced stimulation of 2 genes coding for enzymes of
liver glucose metabolism, namely 6-phosphofructo-2 kinase (PFKFB1;
311790) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1; 261680). Binding of
HNF6 to DNA is required for inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor
activity. In vitro and in vivo experiments suggested that this
inhibition is mediated by a direct HNF6/glucocorticoid receptor
interaction involving the N-terminal domain of HNF6 and the DNA-binding
domain of the receptor. Thus, in addition to its known property of
stimulating transcription of liver-expressed genes, HNF6 can antagonize
glucocorticoid-stimulated gene transcription.

To gain insight into the transcriptional regulatory networks that
specify and maintain human tissue diversity, Odom et al. (2004) used
chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with promoter microarrays to
identify systematically the genes occupied by the transcriptional
regulators HNF1-alpha, HNF4-alpha (600281), and HNF6, together with RNA
polymerase II (see 180660), in human liver and pancreatic islets. Odom
et al. (2004) identified tissue-specific regulatory circuits formed by
HNF1-alpha, HNF4-alpha, and HNF6 with other transcription factors,
revealing how these factors function as master regulators of hepatocyte
and islet transcription.

Odom et al. (2007) analyzed the binding of HNF3B, HNF1A, HNF4A, and HNF6
to 4,000 orthologous gene pairs in hepatocytes purified from human and
mouse livers. Despite the conserved function of these factors, 41 to 89%
of the binding events seemed to be species-specific. Importantly, the
binding sites varied widely between species in ways that could not be
predicted from human-mouse sequence alignments alone.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Vaisse et al. (1997) mapped the
HNF6A gene to 15q21.1-q21.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

During mouse development, Hnf6 is expressed in the epithelial cells that
are precursors of the exocrine and endocrine pancreatic cells. Jacquemin
et al. (2000) investigated the role of Hnf6 in pancreas differentiation
by inactivating its gene in the mouse. In hnf6-null embryos, the
exocrine pancreas appeared to be normal but endocrine cell
differentiation was impaired. The expression of neurogenin-3 (NGN3;
604882), a transcription factor that is essential for determination of
endocrine cell precursors, was almost abolished. Consistent with this,
Jacquemin et al. (2000) demonstrated that Hnf6 binds to and stimulates
the ngn3 gene promoter. At birth, only a few endocrine cells were found
and the islets of Langerhans were missing. Later, the number of
endocrine cells increased and islets appeared. However, the architecture
of the islets was perturbed, and the beta cells were deficient in
glucose transporter-2 (SLC2A2; 138160) expression. Adult hnf6-null mice
were diabetic. The authors concluded that Hnf6 controls pancreatic
endocrine differentiation at the precursor stage and stated that their
data identify Hnf6 as the first positive regulator of the proendocrine
gene ngn3 in the pancreas.

During pancreatic organogenesis, endocrine cells arise from
non-self-renewing progenitors that express Ngn3. Maestro et al. (2003)
showed that from E13 to E18 (the embryonic stage during which the major
burst of beta-cell neogenesis takes place) murine pancreatic duct cells
express Hnf1b (189907), the product of the maturity-onset diabetes of
the young type-5 (MODY5; 137920) gene. Ngn3-positive cells at this stage
invariably cluster with mitotically competent Hnf1b-positive cells and
are often intercalated with these cells in the epithelium that lines the
lumen of primitive ducts. Hnf1b expression is markedly reduced in early
pancreatic epithelial cells of Hnf6-deficient mice, in which formation
of Ngn3-positive cells is defective. Maestro et al. (2003) suggested
that Hnf1b plays a role in the genetic hierarchy regulating the
generation of pancreatic endocrine cells.

608668	TITLE *608668 ZINC FINGER MYND DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 11; ZMYND11
;;BS69
BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED MOLECULE 1, INCLUDED;
BRAM1, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using adenovirus E1A as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a 16-day
whole mouse embryo cDNA library, followed by screening a human colon
carcinoma cDNA library, Hateboer et al. (1995) cloned ZMYND11, which
they called BS69. The deduced 562-amino acid protein had an apparent
molecular mass of about 69 kD following in vitro transcription and
translation. BS69 contains 2 N-terminal zinc finger motifs, followed by
a nuclear localization signal and a C-terminal E1A-binding domain.
Northern blot analysis detected a 4.7-kb transcript in all mouse tissues
examined, with highest expression in kidney.

Using the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of mouse Bmpr1a (601299)
as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human placenta cDNA library,
followed by screening a kidney cDNA library and 5-prime RACE, Kurozumi
et al. (1998) cloned a splice variant of BS69 that they designated
BRAM1. The deduced BRAM1 protein contains the C-terminal 186 amino acids
of BS69 preceded by 12 amino acids unique to BRAM1. Northern blot
analysis detected variable expression of 4.4-kb and 1.3-kb transcripts
in all tissues examined. Following transfection in mouse fibroblasts,
BRAM1 localized to the cytoplasm, whereas BS69 localized to the nucleus.

Masselink and Bernards (2000) noted that BS69 contains 3 motifs involved
in transcription regulation: a PHD finger and bromodomain in its
N-terminal half, and a MYND domain at its extreme C terminus. The MYND
domain, which is also present in the BRAM1 variant, is a 2-zinc finger
motif first identified in Drosophila Deaf1 (602635) and human MTG8
(133435).

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation, Hateboer et al. (1995) confirmed direct
interaction between BS69 and the 289-amino acid isoform of E1A (289R)
following cotransfection in a human cell line; BS69 did not interact
with the shorter 243R E1A isoform. Endogenous BS69 complexed with E1A in
adenovirus-transformed human embryonic kidney cells. C-terminal deletion
mutants of BS69 failed to interact with E1A. BS69 inhibited
transactivation mediated by the 289R E1A protein, but not the 243R E1A
protein. BS69 also suppressed E1A-stimulated transcription of retinoic
acid receptor (see 180240) in COS cells.

Kurozumi et al. (1998) determined that BRAM1 interacts specifically with
the kinase domain of BMPR1A. BS69 did not interact with BMPR1A,
suggesting that the N terminus of BS69 interferes with this interaction.
Further investigation indicated that BRAM1 also interacts with TAB1
(602615). Kurozumi et al. (1998) hypothesized that a ternary complex of
MBPR1A, TAB1, and BRAM1 may be involved in BMP-TAB1-TAK1 (601426)
signaling.

Masselink and Bernards (2000) determined that full transcriptional
repression by BS69 requires the MYND domain. BS69 and BRAM1 interacted
with NCOR (600849) through the MYND domain, but BRAM1 was unable to
repress transcription, indicating that NCOR interaction is necessary but
not sufficient for BS69 repression. Expression of E1A inhibited
repression mediated by BS69.

Ansieau and Leutz (2002) showed that the MYND domain of BS69 interacts
with a conserved PxLxP motif in E1A, the Epstein-Barr virus oncoprotein
EBNA2, and a MYC (190080)-related cellular protein, MGA. The viral
proteins competed with MGA for BS69 binding in a PxLxP-dependent
fashion.

MAPPING

By FISH, Masselink and Bernards (2000) mapped the ZMYND11 gene to
chromosome 10p14.

613598	TITLE *613598 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 513; ZNF513
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Naz et al. (2010) mapped a locus for autosomal recessive retinitis
pigmentosa to chromosome 2p24.1-p22.3 in a consanguineous Pakistani
family. By searching for genes in this region, Li et al. (2010)
identified ZNF513. The deduced 541-amino acid protein has 2 N-terminal
nuclear localization signals and 3 C2H2-type zinc finger motifs.
Quantitative RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression in mouse. In mouse
ocular tissues, expression was highest in retina and lowest in lens and
cornea. Retinal expression of mouse Znf513 increased progressively with
age and began to level off between 180 and 300 days. In situ
hybridization of human retina detected ZNF513 in outer nuclear layer,
inner nuclear layer, and ganglion cell layer. Fluorescence-tagged ZNF513
was expressed in dispersed nuclear foci, but not in nucleolus, of
transfected COS-7 cells.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Li et al. (2010) mapped the ZNF513 gene to
chromosome 2p24.1-p22.3

GENE FUNCTION

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis with transfected mouse
fibroblasts, Li et al. (2010) found that human ZNF513 bound a small
subset of sheared DNA. Specifically, ZNF513 associated with the proximal
promoters of the retinal transcription factors Pax6 (607108) and Sp4
(600540) and those of their targets rhodopsin (RHO; 180380), Irbp (RBP3;
180290), Arr3 (301770), and photoreceptor opsins (e.g., OPN1SW; 613522).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a Pakistani family segregating autosomal
recessive retinitis pigmentosa mapping to chromosome 2p24.1-p22.3,
previously studied by Naz et al. (2010), Li et al. (2010) analyzed 33
candidate genes and identified a homozygous mutation in the ZNF513 gene
(C339R; 613598.0001).

ANIMAL MODEL

By database analysis, Li et al. (2010) found that Znf513 is expressed in
early embryonic zebrafish brain and eyes. They showed that knockdown of
Znf513 in zebrafish embryos caused abnormal retinal development with
major effects on photoreceptors, including retinal thinning with
photoreceptor degeneration.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 58
ZNF513, CYS339ARG

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with retinitis
pigmentosa (RP58; 613617), previously studied by Naz et al. (2010), Li
et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 1015T-C transition in exon 4
of the ZNF513 gene, resulting in a cys339-to-arg (C339R) substitution at
a highly conserved residue. The mutation segregated with disease in the
family and was not found in 242 ethnically matched chromosomes.
Functional studies demonstrated that mutant Znf513 transcript failed to
rescue the abnormal retinal development of knockdown zebrafish compared
to wildtype transcript and that the mutant protein failed to bind to the
promoters of retinal-specific genes.

609350	TITLE *609350 RECEPTOR-TRANSPORTING PROTEIN 4; RTP4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transport of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the cell surface
membrane is critical for receptor-ligand recognition. However, mammalian
GPCR odorant receptors (ORs), when heterologously expressed in cells,
are poorly expressed on the cell surface. By screening for genes that
induced cell surface expression of ORs expressed in human embryonic
kidney cells, Saito et al. (2004) identified mouse and human RTP1
(609137) and RTP2 (609138). They searched databases for homologs of RTP1
and RTP2 and identified RTP3 (607181) and RTP4. In situ hybridization of
mouse olfactory epithelium revealed low expression of Rtp4 in olfactory
neurons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RTP4
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP STS-N23400).

;;RIBOSOMAL S6 KINASE 3; RSK3;;
MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 1C; MAPKAPK1C;;
MAPKAP KINASE 1C
DESCRIPTION Serine/threonine protein kinases in the ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) family
have been implicated as signaling intermediates in the cellular response
to several growth factors. Moller et al. (1994) described the cloning
and characterization of 3 genes encoding 3 isoforms of ribosomal protein
S6 kinase, which they called HU1 (RPS6KA1; 601684), HU2 (RPS6KA2), and
HU3 (RPS6KA3; 300075). The partial HU2 cDNA (GenBank GENBANK L07598)
encodes a predicted protein containing 2 distinct consensus ATP-binding
site sequences. Northern blot and RNase protection analyses detected
major 7.5-kb and minor 3.5-kb HU2 transcripts in fibroblasts, skeletal
muscle, lymphocytes, and placenta.

Zhao et al. (1995) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding the RPS6KA2
isoform of ribosomal protein S6 kinase, which they designated RSK3. The
deduced 733-amino acid RSK3 protein has 84% and 75% sequence identity
with RSK2 (RPS6KA3) and RSK1 (RPS6KA1), respectively. RSK3 has a unique
N-terminal sequence which contains a putative bipartite nuclear
localization signal. Immunoblot analysis of human cell lysates detected
an 83-kD RSK protein. The authors demonstrated serum-stimulated nuclear
translocation of endogenous RSK3 in HeLa cells. RSK3 exhibited
growth-stimulated autophosphorylation and kinase activity; however, its
relative activity toward several known RSK substrates differed from the
activities of other RSKs. Unlike RSK1, RSK3 was not activated by ERK2
(PRKM1; 176948) in vitro. Northern blot analysis detected a single
6.5-kb RSK3 transcript in all tissues examined, with the highest
expression in lung and skeletal muscle.

Goustin (1998) reported that the RSK3 gene (GenBank GENBANK Z98049,
GENBANK AL022069) contains 217,693 bp from the transcriptional start
site to the polyadenylation signal. The gene has 21 exons, with an
88.1-kb intron between exons 1 and 2.

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Moller et al. (1994) mapped the
RPS6KA2 gene to chromosome 6. Zhao et al. (1995) refined the mapping to
6q27 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Zeniou et al. (2002) determined the expression of the RSK1, RSK2, and
RSK3 genes in various human tissues, during mouse embryogenesis, and in
mouse brain. The 3 RSK mRNAs were expressed in all human tissues and
brain regions tested, supporting functional redundancy. However,
tissue-specific variations in levels suggested that the proteins may
also serve specific roles. The mouse Rsk3 gene was prominently expressed
in the developing neural and sensory tissues, whereas Rsk1 gene
expression was the strongest in various other tissues with high
proliferative activity, suggesting distinct roles during development. In
adult mouse brain, the highest levels of Rsk2 expression were observed
in regions with high synaptic activity, including the neocortex, the
hippocampus, and Purkinje cells. The authors suggested that in these
areas, which are essential to cognitive function and learning, the RSK1
and RSK3 genes may not be able to fully compensate for a lack of RSK2
function.

300567	TITLE *300567 PHOSPHOGLYCERATE MUTASE FAMILY MEMBER 4; PGAM4
;;PHOSPHOGLYCERATE MUTASE FAMILY 3; PGAM3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The phosphoglycerate mutase processed gene PGAM3 was originally
described as a pseudogene in human by Dierick et al. (1997). PGAM3
originated by retrotransposition. The parental gene, phosphoglycerate
mutase-1 (PGAM1; 172250), is an intron-containing gene located on human
chromosome 10q25.3, whereas PGAM3 contains no introns and resides on the
X chromosome (Dierick et al., 1997; Betran et al., 2002).

Betran et al. (2002) amplified the full coding sequence of the human and
chimpanzee PGAM3 gene from genomic DNA, and also obtained partial
genomic sequence from the macaque monkey. Analyses of the sequences
indicated the absence of insertions and deletions in the coding region,
and substitution rates that suggested the action of positive selection.
Amino acids known to be important in the active enzyme site of PGAM1 are
conserved in human, chimpanzee, and macaque PGAM3 proteins.

Betran et al. (2002) used nested PCR in an attempt to amplify PGAM3 from
various cDNA libraries. A band was obtained from a leukocyte cDNA
library, but not from HeLa cell, human testis, or human T-cell cDNA
libraries. Restriction digest analysis confirmed that the PCR product
represented PGAM3 and not PGAM1. Betran et al. (2002) suggested that
primate PGAM3 is a newly evolved functional gene and not a pseudogene.
They stated that the presence of the PGAM3 gene in human, chimpanzee,
and macaque suggests that it is no less than 25 million years old.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dierick et al. (1997) found that PGAM3 contains no introns. It has a
poly(A) tail 16 basepairs after the polyadenylation signal at the end of
the 3-prime UTR and is flanked by 10-bp direct repeats, as expected for
a processed gene.

MAPPING

Dierick et al. (1997) identified the human PGAM3 gene within the first
intron of the ATP7A gene (300011), which is mutated in Menkes disease
(309400), on chromosome Xq13.3. Betran et al. (2002) found that the
PGAM3 and ATP7A genes are encoded on opposite strands.

;;POLIOVIRUS RECEPTOR-RELATED 3; PVRR3; PRR3;;
NECTIN 3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Nectins (e.g., PVRL1, 600644) are immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecules
that interact with afadin (AF6; 159559). Afadin is an actin
filament-binding protein that connects nectins to the actin
cytoskeleton. The nectin-afadin system organizes adherens junctions
cooperatively with the cadherin (see 192090)-catenin (see 116805) system
in epithelial cells.

CLONING

By searching an EST database using PRR1, PRR2 (PVRL2; 600798), and PVR
(173850) as queries, followed by RT-PCR of placenta mRNA, Reymond et al.
(2000) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding PRR3. The deduced 550-amino
acid PRR3 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 55.4 kD and
contains an N-terminal hydrophobic leader sequence; an ectodomain
containing a V-type Ig domain and 2 C-type Ig domains bracketed by 6
cysteine residues; a hydrophobic transmembrane region; and a long
cytoplasmic sequence. PRR3 also has 6 potential N-glycosylation sites.
Northern blot analysis revealed PRR3 expression predominantly in
placenta and testis, with faint or no expression in other tissues. A
major transcript of 2.8 kb and minor transcripts of 9.5, 6.0, and 4.7 kb
were detected in placenta. PRR3 was also expressed in mammalian
epithelial cell lines. Flow cytometry showed expression of PRR3 at the
surface of transfected COS-1 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Reymond et al. (2000) found
that PRR3 interacts with both the L- and S-afadin isoforms in a similar
ratio.

Using immunolocalization of adult mouse hippocampal sections Mizoguchi
et al. (2002) found that the nectin-afadin system colocalizes with the
cadherin-catenin system at synapses between mossy fiber terminals and
dendrites of pyramidal cells in the CA3 area. Nectins-1 and -3
asymmetrically localize at the pre- and postsynaptic sides of puncta
adherentia junctions, respectively. During development, nectins-1 and -3
asymmetrically localize not only at puncta adherentia junctions but also
at synaptic junctions. Using rat hippocampal neurons in culture,
Mizoguchi et al. (2002) observed that inhibition of the nectin-based
adhesion results in a decrease in synapse size and a concomitant
increase in synapse number.

Togashi et al. (2011) found that mouse hair cells and supporting cells
express the immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecules nectin-1 (600644) and
-3, respectively, and that their interaction mediates the heterotypic
adhesion between these 2 cell types. Genetic removal of nectin-1 or -3
disrupted the checkerboard-like pattern, inducing aberrant attachment
between hair cells. When cells expressing either nectin-1 or -3 were
cocultured, they arranged themselves into a mosaic pattern. Thus,
Togashi et al. (2011) concluded that nectin-1 and nectin-3 promote the
formation of the checkerboard-like pattern of the auditory epithelia.

ANIMAL MODEL

Inagaki et al. (2006) found that male, but not female, nectin-3 -/- mice
were infertile. Phase contrast microscopy revealed that spermatozoa of
mutant mice showed severe malformation of the head and midpiece.
Nectin-3 knockout resulted in defects in the later steps of sperm
morphogenesis, including distorted nuclei and abnormal distribution of
mitochondria, as well as loss of nectin-2 (PVRL2; 600798) at
Sertoli-spermatid junctions. The localization of nectin-2 at
Sertoli-Sertoli junctions was unaffected.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PVRL3
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP stSG2552).

608730	TITLE *608730 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 39 (ZINC TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 5; SLC39A5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc is an essential cofactor for hundreds of enzymes. It is involved in
protein, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, as well as in
the control of gene transcription, growth, development, and
differentiation. SLC39A5 belongs to a subfamily of proteins that show
structural characteristics of zinc transporters (Taylor and Nicholson,
2003).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to a unique motif within
LIV1 (SLC39A6; 608731), Taylor and Nicholson (2003) identified SLC39A5,
which they designated LZT-Hs7. The deduced 540-amino acid protein
contains a long N terminus, followed by 8 putative transmembrane domains
and a short C terminus. It has a high histidine content, including a
motif similar to the catalytic zinc-binding site of matrix
metalloproteases.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SLC39A5
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP SGC34394).

;;KIAA1582
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a fetal brain cDNA library, Nagase et
al. (2000) cloned TNRC6C, which they designated KIAA1582. The deduced
1,448-amino acid protein contains an RNA recognition motif and a
ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate
expression in heart, kidney, testis, ovary, adult and fetal brain, and
all specific adult brain regions examined. Low expression was detected
in skeletal muscle, and no expression was detected in lung, liver,
pancreas, spleen, and fetal liver.

Schneider et al. (2006) stated that the TNRC6C protein contains a
glycine/tryptophan (GW)-rich N-terminal domain, followed by a UBA
domain, a glutamine-rich region, and a C-terminal RNA recognition motif.

MAPPING

By PCR of a human-rodent hybrid panel, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the
TNRC6C gene to chromosome 17.

611924	TITLE *611924 GAP JUNCTION PROTEIN, ALPHA-10; GJA10
;;CONNEXIN 62; CX62
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Connexins, such as GJA10, are involved in the formation of gap
junctions, intercellular conduits that directly connect the cytoplasms
of contacting cells. Each gap junction channel is formed by docking of 2
hemichannels, each of which contains 6 connexin subunits (Sohl et al.,
2003).

CLONING

By database analysis and PCR of human genomic DNA, Sohl et al. (2003)
cloned GJA10, which they called CX62. CX62 shares 78% amino acid
identity with its mouse ortholog, Cx57. Northern blot analysis detected
a 6.5-kb CX62 transcript in skeletal muscle and heart. Mouse Cx57
appeared to be more widely expressed.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the GJA10 gene to chromosome 6q15 based on an
alignment of the GJA10 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF296766) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

607204	TITLE *607204 PUMILIO, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; PUM1
;;KIAA0099
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing cDNAs randomly selected from a cDNA library derived from
the human immature myeloid cell line KG-1, Nagase et al. (1995) isolated
a cDNA encoding PUM1, a human homolog of the Drosophila Pumilio protein,
which they designated KIAA0099. The predicted 1,186-amino acid KIAA0099
protein is 42.1% identical to Drosophila Pumilio over an 875-amino acid
region . Northern blot analysis detected expression of KIAA0099 in all
tissues tested.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Wang et al. (2002) determined the structure of the RNA-binding domain of
human PUM1 bound to a high-affinity RNA ligand. The RNA binds the
concave surface of the molecule, where each of the protein's 8 repeats
makes contact with a different RNA base via 3 amino acid side chains at
conserved positions. Wang et al. (2002) mutated these 3 side chains in 1
repeat, thereby altering the sequence specificity of PUM1. They
concluded that the high affinity and specificity of the PUM homology
domain for RNA is achieved using multiple copies of a simple repeated
motif.

MAPPING

By analysis of human/rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al. (1995)
mapped the KIAA0099 gene to chromosome 1.

601586	TITLE *601586 PROSTAGLANDIN E RECEPTOR 4, EP4 SUBTYPE; PTGER4
;;EP4R
DESCRIPTION For background information on prostaglandin E receptors, see PTGER1
(176802).

CLONING

Prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes are oxygenated
metabolites of arachidonic acid that are thought to act through
7-transmembrane domain-type receptors (see review by Coleman et al.,
1994). Prostaglandin E2 activates 4 receptors, designated prostaglandin
E receptor subtypes EP1 (176802) through EP4. Several EP4 receptor
cDNAs, originally described as corresponding to an EP2 receptor
(176804), were reported by An et al. (1993) and Bastien et al. (1994).
The pharmacologically correct EP2 was subsequently isolated by Regan et
al. (1994) and the previously described EP2 sequences were renamed EP4
(Coleman et al., 1994). The EP4 receptor is expressed in a variety of
tissues including lung, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and vasculature
(An et al., 1993; Bastien et al., 1994). The EP4R (PTGER4) gene encodes
a deduced 499-amino acid protein (Foord et al., 1996).

In their review, Sugimoto and Narumiya (2007) summarized findings on EP
receptor expression gained through Northern blot analysis of mouse
tissues and in situ hybridization of mouse kidney. They stated that
mouse Ep4 mRNA was highly expressed in thymus, ileum, and uterus, with
lower expression in heart, lung, spleen, and kidney. In mouse kidney,
Ep4 localized to glomeruli.

GENE STRUCTURE

Foord et al. (1996) demonstrated that the EP4R gene contains 3 exons and
spans about 22 kb of genomic DNA. The first exon is noncoding. The gene
structure resembles that of the thromboxane receptor (188070) and the
prostacyclin receptor (600022). The promoter region contains motifs
found in other cytokine-activated genes. Foord et al. (1996) also
observed 2 apparent pseudogenes of EP4R.

MAPPING

Duncan et al. (1995) mapped the PTGER4 gene (which they referred to as
PTGER2) to 5p13.1 by in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Mori et al. (1996) examined the expression of the human EP4 receptor in
cells of the immune system. They found that the level of EP4 receptor in
T-cell lines was downregulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA),
an activator of protein kinase C. On the other hand, Raji and monocytoid
cell lines showed marked upregulation of EP4 receptor in response to
PMA, while levels of other PGE receptors remained unchanged.

Epithelial tumors may be regulated by cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme
products. To determine if COX2 (600262) expression and prostaglandin E2
(PGE2) synthesis are upregulated in cervical cancers, Sales et al.
(2001) used real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis to
confirm COX2 RNA and protein expression in squamous cell carcinomas and
adenocarcinomas. In contrast, minimal expression of COX2 was detected in
histologically normal cervix. Immunohistochemical analyses localized
COX2 expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis to neoplastic
epithelial cells of all squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas
studied. Immunoreactive COX2 and PGE2 were also colocalized to
endothelial cells lining the microvasculature. To establish whether PGE2
has an autocrine/paracrine effect in cervical carcinomas, the authors
investigated the expression of 2 subtypes of PGE2 receptors, namely EP2
and EP4, by real-time quantitative PCR. Expression of EP2 and EP4
receptors was significantly higher in carcinoma tissue than in
histologically normal cervix. The authors concluded that COX2, EP2, and
EP4 expression and PGE2 synthesis are upregulated in cervical cancer
tissue and that PGE2 may regulate neoplastic cell function in cervical
carcinoma in an autocrine/paracrine manner via the EP2/EP4 receptors.

In their review, Sugimoto and Narumiya (2007) stated that mouse Ep2 and
Ep4 receptors couple to G(s) (139320) and mediate increases in cAMP
concentrations. These Ep receptors often function redundantly when
coexpressed, but in dendritic cells, Ep4, but not Ep2, regulates cell
migration.

Hoggatt et al. (2013) showed that inhibition of endogenous PGE2 by
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment in mice resulted in
modest hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) egress from the bone marrow.
Surprisingly, this was independent of the SDF1 (600835)-CXCR4 (162643)
axis implicated in stem cell migration. Comparison of PGE2 receptor
knockout mouse strains demonstrated that progenitor expansion and
stem/progenitor egress resulted from reduced EP4 receptor signaling.
Stem and progenitor cells were found to have differing mechanisms of
egress, with HSC transit to the periphery dependent on niche attenuation
and reduction in the retentive molecule osteopontin (166490).
Hematopoietic grafts mobilized with NSAIDs had superior repopulating
ability and long-term engraftment. Treatment of nonhuman primates and
healthy human volunteers confirmed NSAID-mediated egress in other
species. Hoggatt et al. (2013) concluded that their results not only
uncovered unique regulatory roles for EP4 signaling in HSC retention in
the niche, but also defined a rapidly translatable strategy to enhance
transplantation therapeutically.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a genomewide association study of 547 Caucasian patients with Crohn
disease (IBD18; 612262) from Belgium and 928 controls, Libioulle et al.
(2007) identified a region of approximately 250 kb on chromosome 5p13.1
that contained 6 markers with p less than 10(-6); the association was
replicated in an independent sample of Caucasian CD patients and
controls and further confirmed in a transmission disequilibrium test
involving 137 affected offspring/unaffected parent trios. No known genes
or CpG islands were found within the region of association on 5p13.1,
but studies in lymphoblastoid cell lines revealed that genetic variants
in the CD-associated region differentially regulate expression levels of
the PTGER4 gene. Libioulle et al. (2007) suggested that genetic variants
associated with Crohn disease risk at the IBD locus on chromosome 5p13.1
could modulate cis-acting regulatory elements of PTGER4.

ANIMAL MODEL

Segi et al. (1998) generated mice deficient in the prostaglandin
receptor EP4 by targeted disruption. Loss of the EP4 receptor was not
lethal in utero, but most EP4 -/- neonates became pale and lethargic
approximately 24 hours after birth and died within 72 hours. Less than
5% of the EP4 -/- mice survived and grew normally for more than 1 year.
Histologic exam revealed that the ductus arteriosus in dead neonates
remained open, while it was partially closed in the survivors. In situ
hybridization studies showed that EP4 mRNA was strongly expressed in the
ductus in wildtype mice. Segi et al. (1998) concluded that neonatal
death was at least partly due to patent ductus arteriosus (see 607411),
and that the EP4 receptor plays a role in regulation of the patency of
this vessel. Segi et al. (1998) suggested that normal function of the
EP4 receptor is essential in neonatal adaptation of the circulatory
system.

In rat smooth muscle cells of the ductus arteriosus, Yokoyama et al.
(2006) demonstrated that chronic EP4 stimulation significantly enhanced
hyaluronic acid (HA) production and smooth muscle cell migration from
vascular media into the endothelial layer for intimal cushion formation.
When HA production was inhibited, EP4-mediated migration was negated.
Adenovirus-mediated HA synthase-2 (HAS2; 601636) gene transfer was
sufficient to induce intimal cushion formation in EP4-null rat ductus
arteriosus explants. Yokoyama et al. (2006) concluded that EP4-mediated
signals promote ductus arteriosus closure by HA-mediated intimal cushion
formation.

Prostaglandin E2 exerts its effects through interaction with specific
cell surface receptors. Bone remodeling, comprising resorption of
existing bone and de novo bone formation, is required for the
maintenance of a constant bone mass. Prostaglandin E2 promotes both bone
resorption and bone formation. Using homologous recombination, Yoshida
et al. (2002) generated mice deficient in each of the 4 EP subtypes to
investigate which subtype mediates the bone-forming activity of PGE2 and
how activation of this receptor induces bone formation, and identified
EP4 as the receptor that mediates bone formation in response to this
agent. Consistently, bone formation was induced in wildtype mice by
infusion of an EP4-selective agonist and not by agonists specific for
other EP subtypes. In cultures of bone marrow cells from wildtype mice,
PGE2 induced expression of core-binding factor alpha-1 (RUNX2; 600211)
and enhanced formation of mineralized nodules, both of which were absent
in the culture of cells from EP4-deficient mice. Furthermore,
administration of the EP4 agonist restored bone mass and strength
normally lost in rats subjected to ovariectomy or immobilization.
Histomorphometric analysis revealed that the EP4 agonist induced
significant increases in the volume of cancellous bone, osteoid
formation, and the number of osteoblasts in the affected bone of
immobilized rats, indicating that activation of EP4 induces de novo bone
formation. In addition, osteoclasts were found on the increased bone
surface at a density comparable to that found in the bone of control
animals. These results suggested that activation of EP4 induces bone
remodeling in vivo and that EP4-selective drugs may be beneficial in
humans with osteoporosis.

Kabashima et al. (2002) generated Ep4r -/- mice and found that they
developed severe colitis with 3% DSS treatment, which induced only
marginal colitis in wildtype mice. The phenotype was mimicked in
wildtype mice by administration of an EP4R-selective antagonist
(AE3-208), with impaired mucosal barrier function and induced epithelial
loss, crypt damage, and aggregation of neutrophils and lymphocytes in
the colon. Conversely, administration of an EP4-selective agonist
(AE1-734) in wildtype mice ameliorated severe colitis normally induced
with 7% DSS, whereas administration of AE3-208 suppressed recovery from
colitis and induced significant proliferation of CD4+ T cells. In vitro,
AE3-208 enhanced and AE1-734 suppressed the proliferation and Th1
cytokine production of lamina propria mononuclear cells from the colon.
DNA microarray analysis revealed elevated expression of genes associated
with immune response and reduced expression of genes involved with
mucosal repair and remodeling in the colon of EP4R-deficient mice.
Kabashima et al. (2002) concluded that EP4R regulates intestinal
homeostasis by maintaining mucosal integrity and downregulating the
immune response.

Kabashima et al. (2003) demonstrated that although Langerhans cells
express all 4 PGE receptor subtypes, their migration to regional lymph
nodes was decreased only in EP4-deficient (Ptger4 -/-) mice and in
wildtype mice treated with an EP4 antagonist. An EP4 agonist promoted
the migration of Langerhans cells, increased their expression of
costimulatory molecules, and enhanced their ability to stimulate T cells
in the mixed lymphocyte reaction in vitro. Contact hypersensitivity to
antigen was impaired in Ptger4 -/- mice and in wildtype mice treated
with the EP4 antagonist during sensitization. Kabashima et al. (2003)
concluded that PGE2-EP4 signaling thus facilitates initiation of skin
immune responses by promoting the migration and maturation of Langerhans
cells.

Chicheportiche et al. (1997) isolated a novel tumor necrosis factor

also cloned a homologous human cDNA encoding a predicted 249-amino acid
protein they called TWEAK. The TWEAK protein sequence contains the
single transmembrane domain common to TNF family members. Northern blot
analysis revealed that the 1.4-kb mRNA was expressed at varying levels
in many human tissues and cells.

- TWEAK/APRIL Spliced Read-Through Transcript

By RACE, RT-PCR, and screening of a T-cell cDNA library, Pradet-Balade
et al. (2002) isolated a hybrid transcript formed by intergenic splicing
of exons 1 through 6 of TWEAK to exons 2 through 6 of APRIL (TNFSF13;
604472) using the splice donor/acceptor sites of TWEAK and APRIL mRNAs.
The deduced in-frame fusion protein, which the authors called TWEPRIL,
has a calculated molecular mass of 38 kD. TWEPRIL begins at the
initiation codon of TWEAK and contains the intracellular, transmembrane,
and stalk regions of TWEAK fused to the extracellular receptor-binding
domain of APRIL. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.5-kb TWEPRIL
transcript in resting and activated human primary T cells, in monocytic
cell lines, and in colorectal carcinoma cell lines. Transfected human
embryonic kidney cells expressed TWEPRIL as a 48-kD membrane protein.
TWEPRIL appeared to form SDS-stable aggregates that were likely trimers.
Western blot analysis revealed a 48-kD endogenous TWEPRIL protein in
human primary T cells and monocytic cell lines.

Using Northern blot analysis, Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) found that
relative expression of the 1.9-kb APRIL transcript was about 6-fold
higher than that of the 2.5-kb TWEPRIL transcript in resting T cells.
However, in activated T cells, both transcripts were expressed at
similar levels. A similar expression pattern for APRIL and TWEPRIL was
detected in CD4 (186940)-positive and CD8 (see 186910)-positive T-cell
subpopulations. TWEAK expression was similar between resting and
activated T cells. TWEAK was found predominantly in ribosome-free
fractions in both resting and activated T cells, whereas APRIL and
TWEPRIL increased their association with polyribosomes following T-cell
activation, suggesting that translational efficiency of APRIL and
TWEPRIL increases upon T-cell activation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the TNFSF12 gene contains 7
exons.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid panel, Marsters et al. (1998) mapped
the APO3L gene to 17p13. Using the same technique, Chicheportiche et al.
(1997) refined the map position to 17p13.3.

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the TNFSF12 gene lies 878 bp
upstream of the putative transcriptional start site of the TNFSF13 gene
on chromosome 17p13.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Chicheportiche et al. (1997) found that expressed TWEAK protein was
secreted from cells, probably following proteolytic cleavage. TWEAK
could induce synthesis of IL8 (146930) from several cell types. Purified
TWEAK induced apoptotic death of HT29 cells cultured with human
interferon-gamma (147570).

Marsters et al. (1998) found that TNFSF12, which they called APO3L,
binds to the death domain-containing receptor DR3 (TNFRSF25; 603366).
They characterized the expression pattern of APO3L, as well as its
ability to induce apoptosis and NF-kappa-B (see 164011) activation in
human cell lines, and found that APO3L has overlapping signaling
functions with TNF, but displays a much wider tissue distribution.
Schneider et al. (1999), however, showed that soluble TWEAK induced
apoptosis of a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line through the
autocrine/paracrine action of induced TNF and proposed that TWEAK used a
receptor distinct from TNFRSF25. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated
binding of TWEAK to a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, but Western blot and
RNase protection analyses failed to detect the presence of TNFRSF25 on
the cells.

Using flow cytometry and binding analyses, Kaptein et al. (2000) could
not detect binding of TWEAK or any other known TNF ligand to WSL1
(TNFRSF25). They observed that cells devoid of WSL1 or cells from
knockout mice lacking Wsl1 were TWEAK responsive.

Using techniques similar to those of Marsters et al. (1998), Wiley et
al. (2001) could not reproduce their results showing a TWEAK-APO3
interaction. Wiley et al. (2001) identified TWEAKR (TNFRSF12A; 605914),
a small protein with a cysteine-rich motif and a TRAF (see TRAF5;
602356)-binding site, as the TWEAK receptor. TWEAKR shares homology with
some TNFRs and is a fully functional member of the TNFR family. Blocking
of TWEAKR signaling inhibited the migration of renal microvascular cells
in vitro, indicating that endogenous TWEAK regulates endothelial cell
wound closure rates. Wiley et al. (2001) concluded that the TWEAK-TWEAKR
system plays a role in endothelial cell growth and migration.

Tian et al. (2004) demonstrated a direct interaction between TWEAK and
VG5Q (608464), a secreted angiogenic factor that is mutated in some
cases of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (149000).

Jain et al. (2009) analyzed circulating TWEAK levels in 56 patients with
heart failure and 14 age-matched controls, and found that circulating
TWEAK levels were differentially upregulated in patients with idiopathic
dilated cardiomyopathy (see CMD1A, 115200) compared to patients with
coronary artery disease (see CHDS1, 607339) or hypertension (145500) or
controls. Circulating TWEAK levels did not, however, correlate with
clinical functional parameters in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

- TWEAK/APRIL Spliced Read-Through Transcript

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) found that Jurkat human T cells and Ramos
human B cells cocultured with TWEPRIL-transfected 293T cells showed an
even greater increase in cell growth compared with controls than did
Jurkat human T cells cocultured with APRIL-transfected 293T cells. They
concluded that TWEPRIL is a membrane-bound protein that can induce
proliferation in a manner comparable with APRIL.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using transgenic or adenoviral-mediated gene expression in mice, Jain et
al. (2009) induced elevated circulating levels of TWEAK and observed the
development of dilated cardiomyopathy with subsequent severe cardiac
dysfunction. This phenotype was mediated exclusively by Tweakr,
independent of TNFA, and was associated with cardiomyocyte elongation
and cardiac fibrosis but not cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

603164	TITLE *603164 PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS FACTOR 3; PEX3
;;PEROXIN 3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Peroxins (PEXs) are proteins that are essential for the assembly of
functional peroxisomes. The S. cerevisiae Pex3 protein is a peroxisomal
integral membrane protein required for peroxisome biogenesis and
integrity. By searching an EST database for sequences similar to the
yeast Pichia pastoris Pex3 gene, Kammerer et al. (1998) identified human
PEX3 cDNAs. Two of the cDNAs represent alternatively polyadenylated
transcripts. The deduced 373-amino acid protein shares 23% and 20%
sequence identity with P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae Pex3, respectively.
The yeast and human proteins have 2 predicted transmembrane regions in
their N-terminal halves. Using immunofluorescence, the authors localized
epitope-tagged PEX3 to the peroxisome. Overexpression of PEX3 in
mammalian cells led to proliferation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
membranes, suggesting that the early steps of peroxisome formation may
be directed via the ER. Northern blot analysis revealed that PEX3 was
expressed as a predominant 2.3-kb mRNA and a 1.6-kb mRNA in all human
tissues tested.

GENE STRUCTURE

Muntau et al. (2000) reported the genomic organization of PEX3,
sequencing of the putative promoter region, chromosomal localization,
and physical mapping. The gene contains 12 exons and spans approximately
40 kb. They assigned the gene to chromosome 6q23-q24 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Peroxisome biogenesis disorders, of which several complementation groups
have been identified, are subdivided with regard to 2 major
dysfunctions: peroxisomal matrix protein import and peroxisomal membrane
synthesis. Detectable remnant membrane structures are evident only in
the former. Shimozawa et al. (2000) stated that molecular defects had
been defined in 10 PEX genes, including 8 related to protein import and
2 related to membrane synthesis. Shimozawa et al. (2000) determined that
the human cDNA encoding peroxin-3 rescued the import of both peroxin-3
and the matrix protein in fibroblasts from a Zellweger syndrome patient
of complementation group G (614882). The patient was homozygous for a
mutation in the PEX3 gene (603164.0001).

Muntau et al. (2000) studied 2 patients assigned to complementation
group G of Zellweger syndrome who had been found to display a cellular
phenotype characterized by a lack of even residual peroxisomal membrane
structures. They identified homozygous PEX3 mutations, each leading to
C-terminal truncation of PEX3, in the 2 patients, both of whom suffered
from a severe Zellweger syndrome phenotype; see 603164.0001 and
603164.002.

Ghaedi et al. (2000) studied a patient with Zellweger syndrome of
complementation group G and demonstrated a homozygous inactivating
mutation in PEX3.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 10A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX3, 1-BP INS, 543T

In a patient with Zellweger syndrome of complementation group G (PBD10A;
614882), Muntau et al. (2000) found homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion, a
thymine in exon 7, at nucleotide 543 of the coding region. This
frameshift mutation was predicted to result in a truncation of the
C-terminal 190 amino acids of the protein. The male infant, whose
parents were consanguineous, showed marked muscular hypotonia at birth.
Dysmorphic features included hypertelorism, prominent epicanthic folds,
and a high, broad forehead with round face. Seizures developed on day 1
but were controlled with treatment. His condition deteriorated rapidly,
with death at age 4 months.

In a patient with Zellweger syndrome of complementation group G,
Shimozawa et al. (2000) identified a homozygous 11-bp insertion at
nucleotide 544 in codon val182, resulting in a change of codon (182-183)
and introduction of a termination in codon 184. This mutation is
presumably the same as that described by Muntau et al. (2000).

.0002
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 10A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX3, IVS10AS, T-G, -8

In a patient with Zellweger syndrome of complementation group G (PBD10A;
614882), Muntau et al. (2000) found a T-to-G transversion at position -8
of the 3-prime acceptor splice site of intron 10 of the PEX3 gene. This
mutation led to deletion of exon 11 and a frameshift, with a premature
termination after 3 amino acids, predicting a 56-amino acid C-terminal
truncation of the protein. The male infant was cyanotic and markedly
hypotonic at birth with absent deep tendon reflexes. He had a prominent
midface and an antimongoloid slant of the palpebral fissures, ocular
hypertelorism, small low-set ears, a prominent nose, and a high-arched
palate. The patient died at age 19 days. A brother had been similarly
affected and died at age 15 days. Ghaedi et al. (2000) demonstrated the
same mutation in a study of material from the same patient.

612705	TITLE *612705 RANBP2-LIKE AND GRIP DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; RGPD2
;;RGP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for intrachromosomal duplications of genes in
primates but not in other metazoans, Ciccarelli et al. (2005) identified
8 RGPD genes, including RGPD2, which they called RGP2. The RGPD genes
resulted from duplications of a region of human chromosome 2 containing
the RANBP2 (601181) and GCC2 (612711) genes. Like other RGPD proteins,
the deduced RGPD2 protein exceeds 1,700 amino acids. Most of the
sequence is homologous to regions of RANBP2, except for the C terminus,
which includes the GRIP domain from GCC2. Using primers that did not
differentiate between RGPD1 (612704) and RGPD2 for PCR analysis,
Ciccarelli et al. (2005) detected expression in testis and HeLa cell
cDNA libraries.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ciccarelli et al. (2005) mapped the 8 RGPD
genes to chromosome 2p11.2-q13, and they named the genes according to
their physical order. RGPD2 is the more centromeric of the 2 RGPD genes
on chromosome 2p11.2.

EVOLUTION

See RGPD1 (612704) for information on the evolution of the RGPD genes.

611800	TITLE *611800 THYROID ADENOMA-ASSOCIATED GENE; THADA
;;KIAA1767
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned THADA, which they designated
KIAA1767. The cDNA contains repetitive elements in its 5-prime end, and
the deduced protein contains 894 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected high
expression in liver and moderate expression in all other adult and fetal
tissues examined.

Using positional cloning and 3-prime RACE to identify the gene disrupted
in thyroid adenomas with chromosome 2p21 aberrations, Rippe et al.
(2003) cloned THADA. The full-length protein contains 1,954 amino acids
and has a calculated molecular mass of 220 kD. Rippe et al. (2003) also
identified a THADA splice variant lacking exons 27 and 28. Northern blot
analysis detected variable expression of a 6.2-kb THADA transcript in
all tissues examined.

Drieschner et al. (2007) determined that the full-length THADA protein
contains an ARM repeat for protein-protein interactions. Human THADA
shares 95.9%, 78.2%, and 64.9% amino acid similarity with African green
monkey, mouse, and chicken Thada, respectively. The most conserved
region of THADA among vertebrates corresponds to amino acids 1033 to
1415 of human THADA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rippe et al. (2003) determined that the THADA gene contains 38 exons and
spans about 365 kb. Drieschner et al. (2007) stated that the start codon
of THADA is in exon 2.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rippe et al. (2003) mapped the THADA gene
to chromosome 2p21.

CYTOGENETICS

Rearrangements at chromosome 2p21 are found in about 10% of benign
thyroid tumors. Rippe et al. (2003) found that the 2p21 breakpoint in 2
thyroid adenomas characterized by translocations t(2;20;3)
(p21;q11.2;p25) and t(2;7)(p21;p15), respectively, occurred in exon 28
of the THADA gene. The sequences derived from chromosomes 3p25 and 7p15
did not appear to include a coding region. Drieschner et al. (2007)
determined that the THADA truncations observed in thyroid adenomas by
Rippe et al. (2003) disrupted the most conserved region of the THADA
protein among vertebrates.

EVOLUTION

Green et al. (2010) published a draft sequence of the Neandertal genome.
Comparisons of the Neandertal genome to the genomes of 5 present-day
humans from different parts of the world identified a number of genomic
regions that may have been affected by positive selection in ancestral
modern humans, including genes involved in metabolism and in cognitive
and skeletal development. Green et al. (2010) identified a total of 212
regions containing putative selective sweeps. Of the 20 widest regions,
5 contained no protein-coding genes and the others had 1 to 12 genes.
The widest region is located on chromosome 2 and contains the gene
THADA, where a region of 336 kb is depleted of derived alleles in
Neandertals. SNPs in the vicinity of THADA have been associated with
type 2 diabetes (125853), and THADA expression differs between
individuals with diabetes and healthy controls (Parikh et al., 2009).
Green et al. (2010) also showed that Neandertals shared more genetic
variants with present-day humans in Eurasia than with present-day humans
in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that gene flow from Neandertals into
the ancestors of non-Africans occurred before the divergence of Eurasian
groups from each other.

607733	TITLE *607733 SCRIBBLE, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; SCRIB
;;SCRIBBLE 1; SCRB1;;
CIRCLETAIL, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF;;
KIAA0147
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SCRIB is a cytoplasmic multimodular scaffold protein targeted to
epithelial adherens junctions and neuronal presynaptic compartments.
SCRIB and its orthologs in vertebrates and invertebrates participate in
cell polarization (summary by Nola et al., 2008).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated myeloid leukemia
cell line cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1995) cloned SCRIB, which they
designated KIAA0147. The nucleotide sequence contains a central GAG
repeat that occurs 19 times within a 36-triplet stretch, creating a
glutamine-rich region in the deduced 1,551-amino acid protein. KIAA0147
shares 32% amino acid identity with yeast adenylyl cyclase over a
302-amino acid region. Northern blot analysis revealed expression in all
tissues examined, with highest expression in skeletal muscle.

Nakagawa and Huibregtse (2000) identified a 220-kD protein within the
lysate of a cervical carcinoma cell line that interacts with human
papillomavirus E6 protein. By mass spectrometry of tryptic fragments,
followed by searching an EST database, they determined that the
E6-interacting protein is KIAA0147, the human homolog of Drosophila
Scrib, with which it shares 35% amino acid identity. SCRIB contains a
series of N-terminal leucine-rich repeats and 4 central PDZ domains.
Comparison with the Drosophila protein suggested that the KIAA0147 cDNA
lacks 5-prime sequences specifying approximately 67 amino acids.

Using a positional cloning approach, Murdoch et al. (2003) identified
Scrb1 as the mouse gene mutated in the 'circletail' (crc) phenotype,
which is characterized by craniorachischisis, a severe neural tube
defect. RT-PCR detected several Scrb1 alternative transcripts resulting
from inclusion or exclusion of exons 16, 29, or 36. During mouse
development, expression of Scrb1 showed a dynamic pattern of expression
in a wide variety of organ systems, as well as in neuroepithelium during
initiation of neural tube closure. Expression of Scrb1 overlapped with
expression of Vangl2 (600533), the gene mutated in 'loop-tail,' a
similar defect of neural tube closure. Coexpression was found in
neuroepithelium, ventricular myocardium, eyelid, lung epithelium,
whisker follicles, and the epithelial lining of the stomach.

GENE FUNCTION

Nakagawa and Huibregtse (2000) determined that SCRIB binds directly to
the human papillomavirus E6 protein. They showed that the binding is
mediated by the PDZ domain of SCRIB and a C-terminal epitope of E6.
Fluorescence-labeled SCRIB localized to the periphery of canine kidney
cells, where it colocalized with ZO1 (TJP1; 601009) in tight junctions.
Nakagawa and Huibregtse (2000) determined that SCRIB is targeted for
ubiquitination by a complex of E6 and UBE3A (601623) in vitro and that
expression of E6 induces degradation of SCRIB and DLG (601014) in vivo.
E6 coexpression resulted in loss of integrity of tight junctions, as
measured by ZO1 localization, and this effect was dependent on the
PDZ-binding epitope of E6.

Montcouquiol et al. (2003) showed that a mutation in the Vangl2 gene
results in significant disruptions in the polarization of stereociliary
bundles in mouse cochlea as a result of defects in the direction of
movement and/or anchoring of the kinocilium within each hair cell.
Similar but less severe defects are observed in animals containing a
mutation in the LAP protein family gene Scrb1. Polarization defects in
animals heterozygous for Vangl2 and Scrb1 are comparable with Vangl2
homozygotes, demonstrating genetic interactions between these genes in
the regulation of planar cell polarity in mammals.

Zhan et al. (2008) showed that depletion of Scribble in mammary
epithelia disrupted cell polarity, blocked 3-dimensional morphogenesis,
inhibited apoptosis, and induced dysplasia in vivo that progressed to
tumors after long latency. Like depletion, mislocalization of Scribble
from cell-cell junctions was sufficient to promote cell transformation.
Spontaneous mammary tumors in mice and humans showed both downregulated
and mislocalized Scribble. Zhan et al. (2008) concluded that Scribble
has a role as a tumor suppressor.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Nola et al. (2008) showed that SCRIB
interacted with PAK1 (602590) and PAK2 (605022), serine/threonine
kinases crucial for cell migration. Immunohistochemical analysis showed
that SCRIB and PAK colocalized at the leading edge of migrating human
epithelial cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts in response to
chemoattractants. Knockdown studies with human breast epithelial cells
showed that SCRIB was required for localization of PAK and beta-PIX
(ARHGEF7; 605477) at the leading edge of migrating cells, PAK
activation, formation of membrane protrusions at the leading edge, and
cell motility. Circletail mouse fibroblasts also showed reduced motility
in response to serum stimulation compared with wildtype fibroblasts. The
cell migration defect of SCRIB-deficient cells appeared to be due to
loss of PAK activation, since constitutively active PAK rescued
chemotaxis in SCRIB-deficient cells. Depletion of beta-PIX or SCRIB
caused comparable defects in cell migration and PAK activation. Nola et
al. (2008) concluded that SCRIB participates in lamellipodia formation
through activation of PAK at the leading edge of migratory cells.

Dow et al. (2008) found that knockdown of SCRIB via small hairpin RNA
cooperated with oncogenic RAS (HRAS; 190020) or RAF (RAF1; 164760)
mutants to promote an invasive phenotype in MCF10A breast epithelia
cells. The invasive phenotype was predominantly due to loss of
SCRIB-dependent suppression of MAP kinase signaling.

GENE STRUCTURE

Murdoch et al. (2003) determined that the mouse Scrb1 gene contains 38
exons and spans about 23 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SCRIB
gene to chromosome 8 (TMAP RH25368).

ANIMAL MODEL

Circletail (crc) is a mouse phenotype characterized by
craniorachischisis, a severe neural tube defect. Murdoch et al. (2003)
determined that the circletail mutation is a 1-bp insertion in the Scrb1
gene, resulting in a frameshift that leads to premature termination of
the protein.

Phillips et al. (2007) found that crc mouse mutants developed heart
malformation and cardiomyopathy attributable to abnormalities in
cardiomyocyte organization within the early heart tube. N-cadherin
(CDH2; 114020) was lost from the cardiomyocyte cell membrane and
cell-cell adhesion was disrupted. This resulted in abnormalities in
heart looping and in formation of both the trabeculae and compact
myocardium, which ultimately resulted in cardiac misalignment defects
and ventricular noncompaction. Mislocalization of Vangl2 (600533) in
crc/crc cardiomyocytes suggested that wildtype Scrib acts in the planar
cell polarity pathway in the heart. Moreover, heterozygosity for
mutations in both Scrib and Vangl2 caused cardiac defects similar to
those found in homozygous mutants for each gene but without other major
defects.

601740	TITLE *601740 MEIS1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF, 2; MEIS2
;;MEIS1-RELATED GENE 1; MRG1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Meis1 locus (601739) was isolated as a common site of viral
integration involved in myeloid leukemia in BXH-2 mice. Steelman et al.
(1997) noted that MEIS1 encodes a homeobox protein belonging to the TALE
('three amino acid loop extension') family of homeodomain-containing
proteins. The homeodomain of MEIS1 is the only conserved motif in the
entire 390-amino acid protein. Steelman et al. (1997) reported that
Southern blot analyses using the MEIS1 homeodomain as a probe revealed
the existence of a family of Meis1-related genes (MRGs) in several
divergent species. In addition, the 3-prime untranslated region (UTR) of
MEIS1 is remarkably conserved in evolution. Steelman et al. (1997)
cloned Meis1-related genes from the mouse and human genomes. One such
gene, which the authors designated Mrg1, shares a similar genomic
organization in the mouse with Meis1.

During the course of their studies of the human MEIS1 homeobox gene,
Smith et al. (1997) identified a gene closely related but not identical
to MEIS1. Sequence analysis showed it to be the human counterpart of the
mouse gene Meis2 (Nakamura et al., 1996). Human MEIS2 was found to be
expressed in various human tissues. In hematopoietic tissues, the
lymphoid organs expressed high levels of MEIS2 as 2 transcripts of 4.0
kb and 3.5 kb. MEIS2 is also expressed in some regions of the brain,
such as the putamen.

GENE FUNCTION

Capdevila et al. (1999) showed that restriction of expression of the
chick homeobox gene Meis2 to proximal regions of the limb bud is
essential for limb development, since ectopic Meis2 severely disrupted
limb outgrowth. They also uncovered an antagonistic relationship between
the secreted factor gremlin (GREM1; 603054) and the bone morphogenetic
proteins (Bmps; see 112264) that is required to maintain the Sonic
hedgehog (600725)/fibroblast growth factor (see 131220) loop that
regulates distal outgrowth. These proximal and distal factors were found
to have coordinated activities: Meis2 could repress distal genes, and
the Bmp and Hoxd (142987) genes restricted Meis2 expression to the
proximal limb bud. Moreover, combinations of Bmps and apical ectodermal
ridge (AER) factors were sufficient to distalize proximal limb cells.
These results unveiled a set of proximal-distal regulatory interactions
that establish and maintain outgrowth of the vertebrate limb.

Mercader et al. (1999) described the role of homeobox genes Meis1,
Meis2, and Pbx1 (176310) in the development of mouse, chicken, and
Drosophila limbs. Mercader et al. (1999) found that Meis1 and Meis2
expression is restricted to the proximal domain, coincident with the
previously reported domain in which Pbx1 is localized to the nucleus.
Meis1 regulates Pbx1 activity by promoting nuclear import of the Pbx1
protein. Mercader et al. (1999) also demonstrated that ectopic
expression of Meis1 in chicken disrupts distal limb development and
induces distal-to-proximal transformations. Mercader et al. (1999)
concluded that the restriction of Meis1 to proximal regions of the
vertebrate limb is essential to specify cell fates and differentiation
patterns along the proximodistal axis of the limb.

PAX6 (607108) is required for formation of the lens placode, an
ectodermal thickening that precedes lens development. Zhang et al.
(2002) found that Meis1 and Meis2 were developmentally expressed in mice
in a pattern similar to that of Pax6. Biochemical and transgenic
experiments revealed that Meis1 and Meis2 bound a specific 26-bp
sequence in the Pax6 lens placode enhancer that was required for its
activity. Pax6 and Meis2 exhibited a strong genetic interaction in lens
development, and Pax6 expression was elevated in lenses of
Meis2-overexpressing transgenic mice. When expressed in embryonic lens
ectoderm, dominant-negative forms of Meis downregulated endogenous Pax6.

Using knockdown and overexpression studies, Conte et al. (2010) showed
that microRNA-204 (MIR204; 610942) was required for correct lens and
optic cup development in medaka fish. They identified a conserved
functional MIR204 target site in the 3-prime UTR of medaka and human
MEIS2. Most, but not all, consequences of Mir204 knockdown in medaka
were due to abnormal Meis2-mediated regulation of the Pax6
transcriptional network.

MAPPING

Nakamura et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Meis2 gene to chromosome 2 in a
region syntenic to human chromosome 15q. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization with a genomic MEIS2 clone, Smith et al. (1997) mapped the
human MEIS2 gene to a position that is 27% of the distance from the
chromosome 15 centromere to the telomere, corresponding to chromosome
15q14.

Steelman et al. (1997) found that Mrg1 was located on mouse chromosome
2, not mouse chromosome 11, where Meis1 maps. In humans, Steelman et al.
(1997) mapped MRG1 to chromosome 15q22-q25 in a region associated with
various cytogenetic abnormalities associated with acute myelocytic
leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and astrocytomas. The authors
reported data suggesting that another related gene (MRG2) maps to human
chromosome 17.

607788	TITLE *607788 MULTIPLE COAGULATION FACTOR DEFICIENCY PROTEIN 2; MCFD2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Deka et al. (1988) cloned a gene they designated T+ due to the presence
of a transposon-like human repeat element (THE1) in the unusually long
3-prime untranslated region. The deduced protein contains 79 amino acids
and shares significant similarity with troponin-c (see 191040) and
calmodulin (see 114180) within a conserved 12-amino acid motif. Deka et
al. (1988) also identified a transcribed pseudogene, which they called
T-, that contains an interspersed Alu repeat instead of the THE1
element. Northern blot analysis of tissues and cell lines detected major
transcripts of 4.0, 3.0, 1.9, and 0.85 kb. A 2.5-kb transcript was also
detected in a neuroblastoma sample. The 4.0- and 1.9-kb transcripts were
present in HeLa cell polysome fractions, leading the authors to conclude
that they are likely translated.

Using a positional cloning strategy, Zhang et al. (2003) searched for
the gene responsible for the form of combined deficiency of factor V and
factor VIII that mapped to the region 2p21-p16.3 (F5F8D2; 613625). The
candidate genetic interval of approximately 2.4 Mb in the draft human
genome sequence contained about 20 known and predicted genes and a
number of partial ESTs, none of which had sequence homology to known
components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi. Direct DNA
sequencing of individual candidate genes identified mutations in the
predicted exons and intron-exon junctions of a partial cDNA, HUMTRANSC,
previously reported based on its unusually long 3-prime untranslated
region containing a THE1. This gene, renamed MCFD2 (multiple coagulation
factor deficiency protein-2) by Zhang et al. (2003), contains a
145-amino acid open reading frame and is identical to the T+ gene
reported by Deka et al. (1988). Notable features include a predicted
signal peptide at the N terminus and 2 calmodulin-like EF-hands for
putative calcium binding at the C terminus. Northern blot analysis
showed that MCFD2 is expressed in multiple tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2003) showed that MCFD2 and the LMAN1 gene, which is
mutant in the most common form of F5F8D (F5F8D1; 227300), colocalize in
the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and
that MCFD2 is localized to the ERGIC through a direct, calcium-dependent
interaction with LMAN1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2003) determined that the MCFD2 gene contains 4 exons
encompassing approximately 19 kb of genomic DNA. Deka et al. (1988)
determined that the promoter region of the MCFD2 gene contains a CAAT
element and a TATA element. The THE1 element is oriented in the reverse
direction of the gene.

MAPPING

Zhang et al. (2003) identified the MCFD2 gene within a critical region
on chromosome 2p21-p16.3 associated with F5F8D.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Zhang et al. (2003) identified 7 distinct mutations in the MCFD2 gene
accounting for F5F8D in 9 of 12 families. The affected individual in 1
of these families was 1 of the original F5F8D probands reported by Oeri
et al. (1954). Most of the mutations resulted in a null allele with
complete lack of protein expression (607788.0001-607788.0005). The other
2 mutations were missense (607788.0006-607788.0007). In vitro functional
expression studies in HeLa cells showed that LMAN1 did not
coimmunoprecipitate with missense mutant MCFD2. The results suggested an
essential role for the second EF-hand of MCFD2 in the calcium-dependent
interaction with LMAN1 and the subsequent function of the MCFD2-LMAN1
complex in the transport of factor V and factor VIII.

Zhang et al. (2008) identified 4 different MCFD2 mutations (see, e.g.,
607788.0008) in affected members of 4 families with combined factor V
and factor VIII deficiency. The families were of Greek, Afro-Caribbean,
Saudi Arabian, and Italian descent.

substitution in a highly conserved residue within 1 of the EF-hand
domains. In vitro functional expression studies in COS-1 cells showed
that D81Y-mutant protein failed to coimmunoprecipitate with LMAN1.

603417	TITLE *603417 RAB-INTERACTING FACTOR; RABIF
;;RAS-SPECIFIC GUANINE-RELEASING FACTOR 3; RASGRF3;;
MAMMALIAN SUPPRESSOR OF SEC4; MSS4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Sec4/Rab-related small GTP-binding proteins are involved in the
regulation of intracellular vesicular transport. Mss4 stimulates GTP-GDP
exchange in Sec4 and Rab and binds to a subset of genetically related
Rab proteins.

CLONING

Yu and Schreiber (1995) cloned a human MSS4 cDNA. The gene encodes a
123-amino acid polypeptide that requires zinc for stability.

Muller-Pillasch et al. (1997) showed by Northern blot analysis that MSS4
is expressed as 3 differently sized mRNAs, probably due to alternative
polyadenylation signals. The transcripts are present at barely
detectable levels in healthy pancreas, but at much higher levels in
pancreatic and other cancer tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Wixler et al. (1999) identified MSS4 as a binding partner of integrin
alpha-3 (605025) in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a placenta cDNA library.
Using the conserved C-terminal motif of several other alpha-integrin
subunits, they found that MSS4 bound specifically to integrins
containing an aromatic amino acid before the first lysine of the
conserved motif. These integrins included alpha-2 (192974), alpha-3A,
alpha-3B, alpha-5 (135620), and alpha-6A (147556).

MAPPING

Muller-Pillasch et al. (1997) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to
map the MSS4 gene to human chromosome 1q32-q41.

607707	TITLE *607707 CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE II-BETA; CAMK2B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CAMK2B belongs to a family of type II multifunctional calcium- and
calmodulin (see 114180)-dependent protein kinases. There are at least 4
CAMK2 genes, and each yields several isoforms through alternative
splicing. CAMK2B is a prominent kinase in the central nervous system and
may function in long-term potentiation and neurotransmitter release.

CLONING

Tombes and Krystal (1997) cloned a number of CAMK2B variants from
several human tumor cell line and brain cDNA libraries. CAMK2B showed
wide tissue and cell distribution, but 1 variant predominated in adult
brain. The expression of other variants depended upon the tissue of
origin and whether the source was normal or tumor tissue.

By searching an EST database using rat Camk2 as query, followed by
screening a brain cDNA library, Li et al. (2001) obtained a full-length
cDNA encoding CAMK2B. The deduced protein contains 542 amino acids. A
comparison of CAMK2B and CAMK2A (114078) detected no amino acid changes
within the functional domains, including the ATP-binding site, the
calmodulin-binding domain, and autophosphorylation sites. Northern blot
analysis detected a major 3.9-kb transcript in adult and fetal brain;
expression was slightly lower in fetal brain. Using PCR primers designed
to identify alternatively spliced isoforms, Li et al. (2001) identified
3 CAMK2B isoforms in adult and fetal brain. Like other CAMK2 isoforms,
the CAMK2B isoforms have an insertion or deletion of 11 to 39 amino
acids within the central variable region.

Wang et al. (2000) identified and cloned CAMK2B by searching an EST
database using mouse Camk2b. They obtained a full-length cDNA by 5-prime
RACE of a brain cDNA library. Wang et al. (2000) also identified 5
splice variants resulting from alternative splicing within 7 central
variable domains, termed V1 to V7. The deduced proteins have calculated
molecular masses between 49 and 60 kD. Transient transfection of 3
CAMK2B variants in HEK293 cells revealed that all 3 were cytosolic
proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2000) showed that full-length CAMK2B and a variant lacking
V1 displayed Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase activity against a
peptide substrate. Another variant lacking V1 through V5 did not exhibit
significant kinase activity under the same conditions.

By Western blot analysis, Thiagarajan et al. (2002) found that the
protein levels of Camk2a and Camk2b were inversely related during
activity in cultured rat pup hippocampal neurons. The levels of Camk2a
increased with heightened activity, and the levels of Camk2b increased
with suppression of activity. Thiagarajan et al. (2002) hypothesized
that the change in the ratio may help tune the Camk2 holoenzyme to
changing intensities of Ca(2+) signaling.

Novak et al. (2000) determined that expression of CAMK2B mRNA was
elevated about 2-fold in postmortem frontal cortex of schizophrenia
(181500) patients relative to controls.

Konig et al. (2010) used an integrative systems approach, based on
genomewide RNA interference screening, to identify 295 cellular
cofactors required for early-stage influenza virus replication. Within
this group, those involved in kinase-regulated signaling,
ubiquitination, and phosphatase activity are the most highly enriched,
and 181 factors assemble into a highly significant host-pathogen
interaction network. Moreover, 219 of the 295 factors were confirmed to
be required for efficient wildtype influenza virus growth, and further
analysis of a subset of genes showed 23 factors essential for viral
entry, including members of the vacuolar ATPase (see 192132) and COPI
(see 601924) protein families, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)
proteins, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-beta (605004).
Furthermore, 10 proteins were confirmed to be involved in post-entry
steps of influenza virus replication. These include nuclear import
components, proteases, and CAMK2B. Notably, growth of swine-origin HIN1
influenza virus is also dependent on the identified host factors, and
Konig et al. (2010) showed that small molecule inhibitors of several
factors, including vATPase and CAMK2B, antagonize influenza virus
replication.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang et al. (2000) determined that the variable region of the CAMK2B
protein is encoded by at least 7 exons. Alternative splicing within this
region gives rise to CAMK2B variants.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wang et al. (2000) mapped the CAMK2B gene
to chromosome 7.

140580	TITLE *140580 HEAT-SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 1; HSF1
;;HEAT-SHOCK FACTOR 1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HSF1 plays a crucial role in inducing heat shock proteins (e.g., HSPA1A;
140550), which is required for thermotolerance. In addition, HSF1 is
involved in oogenesis, spermatogenesis, and placental development
(summary by Inouye et al., 2004).

CLONING

Heat-shock transcription factors (HSFs) activate heat-shock response
genes under conditions of heat or other stresses. By screening cDNA
libraries with a human cDNA fragment produced by PCR with primers
deduced from conserved amino acids in the Drosophila and yeast HSF
sequences, Rabindran et al. (1991) isolated a cDNA for a human HSF,
referred to as HSF1. The deduced full-length 529-amino acid protein is
rich in prolines and serines and contains 4 putative leucine zipper
motifs. Northern blot analysis of HeLa cells detected a 2.0- to 2.2-kb
HSF1 transcript that was expressed at similar levels before and after
heat shock.

By immunohistochemical analysis of mouse testis, Akerfelt et al. (2010)
found that Hsf1 was highly and specifically expressed in nuclei of
spermatocytes and round spermatids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (1998) determined that the mouse Hsf1 gene contains 13
exons. The first exon of the Bop1 gene (610596) lies on the opposite
strand and just upstream of the Hsf1 translation initiation site.
Functional analysis showed that the region of overlap behaves as a
bidirectional promoter for transcription of both genes.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the HSF1 gene to chromosome 8q24.3 based on an
alignment of the HSF1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC014638) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Using recombinant human protein, Rabindran et al. (1991) found that HSF1
specifically bound to heat shock elements (HSEs) and stimulated
transcription from HSEs in a Drosophila embryo cell-free transcription
system.

In a novel in vitro system in which human HSF1 can be activated by
nonnative protein, heat, and geldanamycin, Zou et al. (1998) found that
addition of Hsp90 (140571) inhibited activation. Reduction of the level
of Hsp90 dramatically activated HSF1. Hsp90-containing HSF1 complex is
present in the unstressed cell and dissociates during stress. Zou et al.
(1998) concluded that Hsp90, by itself and/or associated with
multichaperone complexes, is a major repressor of HSF1.

In ECGs of transgenic mouse hearts overexpressing a constitutively
active form of Hsf1, Zou et al. (2003) found faster recovery from
ST-segment elevation induced by ischemia/reperfusion injury. There was a
smaller area of infarction and less cardiomyocyte death compared to
wildtype mice. Protein kinase B/Akt (see AKT1; 164730) was more strongly
activated, whereas Jun N-terminal kinase (see JNK1; 601158) and
caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636) were less active in transgenic hearts than
wildtype hearts. Zou et al. (2003) concluded that HSF1 protects
cardiomyocytes from death, at least in part, through activation of AKT
and inactivation of JNK and CASP3.

The heat-shock transcription factor HSF1 is present in unstressed cells
in an inactive monomeric form and becomes activated by heat and other
stress stimuli. HSF1 activation involves trimerization and acquisition
of a site-specific DNA-binding activity, which is negatively regulated
by interaction with certain heat-shock proteins. Shamovsky et al. (2006)
showed that HSF1 activation by heat shock is an active process that is
mediated by a ribonucleoprotein complex containing translation
elongation factor eEF1A (130590) and a previously unknown noncoding RNA
that they termed heat-shock RNA-1 (HSR1; 610157). HSR1 is constitutively
expressed in human and rodent cells and its homologs are functionally
interchangeable. Both HSR1 and eEF1A are required for HSF1 activation in
vitro; antisense oligonucleotides or short interfering RNA against HSR1
impaired the heat-shock response in vivo, rendering cells
thermosensitive. Shamovsky et al. (2006) suggested that the central role
of HSR1 during heat shock implies that targeting this RNA could serve as
a new therapeutic model for cancer, inflammation, and other conditions
associated with HSF1 deregulation.

Using differential display of DNA-binding proteins to screen mouse liver
extracts collected throughout the light/dark cycle, Reinke et al. (2008)
found that Hsf1 exhibited highly circadian DNA-binding activity. Hsf1
drove expression of heat-shock proteins at the onset of the dark phase,
when the animals became behaviorally active. Furthermore, Hsf1-deficient
mice had a longer free-running period than wildtype littermates.

Westerheide et al. (2009) demonstrated that human HSF1 is inducibly
acetylated at a critical residue (lysine-80, K80) that negatively
regulates DNA-binding activity. Activation of the deacetylase and
longevity factor SIRT1 (604479) prolonged HSF1 binding to the heat-shock
promoter HSP70 (140550) by maintaining HSF1 in a deacetylated, DNA
binding-competent state. Conversely, downregulation of SIRT1 accelerated
the attenuation of the heat-shock response and release of HSF1 from its
cognate promoter elements. Westerheide et al. (2009) concluded that
their results provided a mechanistic basis for the requirement of HSF1
in the regulation of life span and established a role for SIRT1 in
protein homeostasis and the heat-shock response.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation on promoter microarray (ChIP-chip)
analysis, Akerfelt et al. (2010) discovered that Hsf1 bound 742 putative
target genes in mouse testis. Hsf1 predominantly bound genes associated
with transcription and nucleic acid binding, and it showed prominent
association with multicopy genes of the sex chromosomes. ChIP analysis
confirmed specific binding of Hsf1 to multicopy genes on the Y and X
chromosomes. Hsf1 localized to sex chromatin both prior to and after
meiotic divisions in a repressed chromatin environment.

Kourtis et al. (2012) demonstrated that heat stroke triggers pervasive
necrotic cell death and neurodegeneration in C. elegans. Preconditioning
of animals at a mildly elevated temperature strongly protected from
heat-induced necrosis. The heat-shock transcription factor HSF1 and the
small heat-shock protein HSP-16.1 mediate cytoprotection by
preconditioning. HSP-16.1 localizes to the Golgi, where it functions
with the calcium- and magnesium-transporting ATPase PMR1 (604384) to
maintain calcium homeostasis under heat stroke. Preconditioning also
suppresses cell death inflicted by diverse insults, and protects
mammalian neurons from heat cytotoxicity. Kourtis et al. (2012)
concluded that their findings revealed an evolutionarily conserved
mechanism that defends against diverse necrotic stimuli. In mouse
cortical neurons and striatal cells, Kourtis et al. (2012) found that
overexpression of crystallin alpha-A (123580), which colocalizes with
the Golgi marker alpha-mannosidase-II (154582) and the PMR1 ATPase, was
sufficient to protect mammalian neurons from heat stroke-induced death,
even in the absence of preconditioning. Heat stroke caused massive
necrotic death and axonal degeneration in neurons expressing short
hairpin RNAs against Pmr1, even after preconditioning.

Through integrated chemical-genetic analyses, Santagata et al. (2013)
found that a dominant transcriptional effect of blocking protein
translation in cancer cells was inactivation of HSF1, a multifaceted
transcriptional regulator of the heat-shock response and many other
cellular processes essential for anabolic metabolism, cellular
proliferation, and tumorigenesis. These analyses linked translational
flux to the regulation of HSF1 transcriptional activity and to the
modulation of energy metabolism. Targeting this link with translation
initiation inhibitors such as rocaglates deprived cancer cells of their
energy and chaperone armamentarium and selectively impaired the
proliferation of both malignant and premalignant cells with early-stage
oncogenic lesions.

ANIMAL MODEL

Christians et al. (2000) demonstrated that mouse embryos from Hsf1 -/-
females are unable to develop properly beyond the zygotic stage,
although oocytes were ovulated and fertilized normally. Wildtype
spermatozoa did not save zygotes from lethality, indicating that the
reproductive failure of females deficient in this factor is caused by a
'maternal effect' mutation, and that HSF1 from the mother normally
controls early postfertilization development. Female mice lacking the
gene encoding HSF1 have normal ovaries and reproductive tracts,
indicating that folliculogenesis and oogenesis do not require HSF1
expression, by contrast with the Drosophila HSF mutation and others
affecting fertility in mammals. Ovulated eggs of Hsf1 -/- females
remained properly arrested at metaphase 2 until fertilization, after
which zygotes formed with 2 pronuclei and a second polar body. Although
mutant embryos produced by Hsf1 -/- females can initiate early
development, they do not survive after transplantation into the oviduct
of the Hsf1 wildtype mice, indicating that the causes of Hsf1 -/-
infertility are intrinsic rather than extrinsic. Hsf1-mutant zygotes
were able to express heat-shock proteins, demonstrating that zygotic
transcriptional activity can begin without HSF1. Ultrastructural
analysis indicated that abnormalities affect mainly the nuclei of
embryos from null females at the 2-cell stage.

The C. elegans transcription factor hsf1 regulates the heat-shock
response and influences aging. Reducing hsf1 activity accelerates tissue
aging and shortens life span; Hsu et al. (2003) showed that hsf1
overexpression extends life span. Hsu et al. (2003) found that hsf1,
like the transcription factor daf16, whose human homologs include FOXO1
(136533), FOXO3 (602681), and FOXO4 (300033), is required for
daf2-insulin (176730)/Igf1 receptor (147370) mutations to extend life
span. Hsu et al. (2003) concluded that this is because hsf1 and daf16
together activate expression of specific genes, including genes encoding
small heat-shock proteins, which in turn promote longevity. The small
heat-shock proteins also delay the onset of polyglutamine-expansion
protein aggregation, suggesting that these proteins couple the normal
aging process to this type of age-related disease.

Steele et al. (2008) found that Hsf1-knockout mice died significantly
faster after inoculation with prion proteins (176640) compared to
wildtype mice with intact Hsf1 genes. However, both Hsf1-knockout and
wildtype mice showed a similar timing in onset of behavioral
abnormalities and pathologic changes after inoculation. The findings
suggested a protective role for HSF1 in prion pathogenesis and establish
that it is specific to disease progression as distinct from disease
onset.

Akerfelt et al. (2010) found that Hsf1 -/- male mice displayed regions
of seminiferous tubules containing only spermatogonia and increased
morphologic abnormalities of sperm heads. Hsf1 -/- epididymis showed
defects in chromatin packing and placement of chromatin-packing
proteins.

Inouye et al. (2004) found that Hsf1 -/- mice immunized with sheep red
blood cells exhibited a significant decrease in T cell-dependent B-cell
responses, with diminished production of IgG, particularly IgG2a, and
normal production of IgM. ELISA and microarray analysis in stimulated
splenocytes and peritoneal macrophages showed significantly lower Il6
(147620) and Ccl5 (187011) in Hsf1 -/- cells compared with wildtype
cells. ChIP analysis identified IL6 as a direct target of Hsf1. Inouye
et al. (2004) concluded that HSF1 is linked molecularly to IL6, which is
involved in immunity and inflammation.

NOMENCLATURE

Schuetz (1991) pointed out that although the names HSF1 and HSF2
(140581) were chosen for historical reasons, these peptides should be
