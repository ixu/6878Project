611348	TITLE *611348 INTEGRATOR COMPLEX SUBUNIT 4; INTS4
;;INT4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

INTS4 is a subunit of the Integrator complex, which associates with the
C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II large subunit (POLR2A; 180660)
and mediates 3-prime end processing of small nuclear RNAs U1 (RNU1;
180680) and U2 (RNU2; 180690) (Baillat et al., 2005).

GENE FUNCTION

By SDS-PAGE of proteins that copurified with INTS11 (CPSF3L; 611354) in
HEK293 cells, Baillat et al. (2005) identified INTS4 as a subunit of the
Integrator complex.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the INTS4
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP RH12075).

;;NEOPLASTIC TRANSFORMATION INHIBITOR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a glioma cDNA expression library with antibodies raised
against a nuclear protein, Matsuhashi et al. (1997) cloned PDCD4, which
they designated H731. The deduced 458-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 50.6 kD. PDCD4 is an acidic protein with
characteristics of a nuclear nonhistone protein. It contains 2
overlapping GxGxxG nucleotide-binding motifs, which are characteristic
of protein kinases, but it does not have a kinase catalytic domain.
PDCD4 also has several putative serine and threonine phosphorylation
sites. Northern blot analysis detected transcripts of about 2.7 and 3.8
kb in HeLa cell total RNA. Recombinant PDCD4 expressed in E. coli
resulted in proteins with apparent molecular masses of 56 and 37 kD. The
37-kD truncated protein was synthesized from val127, reading the val
codon as an f-met initiation codon.

Yoshinaga et al. (1999) found that PDCD4 accumulated in the nuclei of
confluent or quiescent normal fetal lung fibroblasts, but it was
overproduced and localized in the cytoplasm during the cell cycle in
tumor cell lines. Immunohistologic analysis revealed that PDCD4 was
highly expressed in bladder carcinoma and breast carcinoma tissues
compared with normal tissues. PDCD4 was also abundantly expressed in the
small duct epithelial cells of normal mammary gland.

GENE FUNCTION

By Northern blot and Western blot analyses, Kang et al. (2002)
determined that expression of both the PDCD4 transcript and protein was
upregulated in senescent diploid fibroblasts compared with cells in log
phase growth. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis showed that the C terminus of
PDCD4 could interact with a component of the 40S ribosome complex, RPS13
(180476), and with RPL5 (603634) and TI-227H. In vitro binding assays
confirmed the interaction between PDCD4 and RPS13. In vitro pull-down
assays also showed that PDCD4 interacted with EIF4G (600495), but not
with EIF4E (133440). Furthermore, PDCD4 localized to polysome fractions
of fractionated HeLa cells. Kang et al. (2002) concluded that PDCD4 may
regulate EIF4G-dependent translation through direct interaction with
EIF4G and RPS13 in senescent fibroblasts.

Dorrello et al. (2006) found that the tumor suppressor PDCD4 inhibits
the translation initiation factor EIF4A (see 602641), an RNA helicase
that catalyzes the unwinding of secondary structure at the 5-prime
untranslated region of mRNAs. In response to mitogens, PDCD4 was rapidly
phosphorylated on ser67 by the protein kinase S6K1 (608938) and
subsequently degraded via the ubiquitin ligase SCF-beta(TRCP) (603482).
Expression in cultured cells of a stable PDCD4 mutant that was unable to
bind beta-TRCP inhibited translation of an mRNA with a structured
5-prime untranslated region, resulted in smaller cell size, and slowed
down cell cycle progression. Dorrello et al. (2006) proposed that
regulated degradation of PDCD4 in response to mitogens allows efficient
protein synthesis and consequently cell growth.

PDCD4 contains 2 tandem MA3 domains consisting of conserved
alpha-helical hairpins. Using x-ray crystallography, NMR, and surface
plasmon resonance, Suzuki et al. (2008) found that both MA3 domains of
human PDCD4 were structurally and functionally similar and bound
specifically to the N-terminal domain of EIF4A using similar binding
interfaces. The MA3 domains of PDCD4 competed with the MA3 domain of
EIF4G and RNA for EIF4A binding. Suzuki et al. (2008) concluded that
PDCD4 inhibits translation initiation by displacing EIF4G and RNA from
EIF4A. They proposed that the PDCD4 MA3 domains act synergistically to
form a tighter and more stable complex with EIF4A, explaining the need
for 2 tandem MA3 domains.

Davis et al. (2008) demonstrated that induction of a contractile
phenotype in human vascular smooth muscle cells by TGF-beta (190180) and
BMPs (see 112264) is mediated by miR21 (611020). miR21 downregulates
PDCD4, which in turn acts as a negative regulator of smooth muscle
contractile genes. Davis et al. (2008) concluded that PDCD4 is a
functional target of miR21 involved in the BMP-mediated induction of
smooth muscle cell markers in vascular smooth muscle cells.

Asangani et al. (2008) identified an miR21 target sequence in the
3-prime UTR of PDCD4 and confirmed binding and inhibition of PDCD4 by
miR21 using reporter gene assays. They observed an inverse correlation
between miR21 and PDCD4 expression in 10 colorectal cell lines and in 22
colorectal cancer tissues and matched normal controls. Transfection of
RKO human colorectal cancer cells with anti-miR21 increased PDCD4
protein concentration, reduced the invasive potential of RKO cells in
3-dimensional gels, and reduced intravasation and lung metastasis of RKO
cells in a chicken embryo metastasis assay. Overexpression of miR21
reduced expression of PDCD4 protein, but not mRNA, in Colo206f cells.

MAPPING

By FISH, Soejima et al. (1999) mapped the PDCD4 gene to chromosome
10q24.

606028	TITLE *606028 CLEAVAGE AND POLYADENYLATION SPECIFICITY FACTOR 2; CPSF2
;;CLEAVAGE-POLYADENYLATION SPECIFICITY FACTOR, 100-KD SUBUNIT; CPSF100
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) is a multisubunit
complex that plays a central role in 3-prime processing of pre-mRNAs.
CPSF recognizes the AAUAAA signal in the pre-mRNA and interacts with
other proteins to facilitate both RNA cleavage and poly(A) synthesis
(summary by Murthy and Manley, 1995). The CPSF2 gene encodes the 100-kD
subunit of CPSF.

CLONING

Jenny et al. (1994) cloned a cDNA encoding bovine Cpsf2. Northern blot
analysis using bovine Cpsf2 coding sequences revealed expression of
5.6-, 4.6-, 3.8-, and 3.0-kb transcripts in HeLa cells. Immunoblot
analysis showed expression of a 100-kD nuclear protein in bovine and
human cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated expression of
both the 100-kD and the 160-kD (CPSF1; 606027) CPSF subunits in
nucleoplasm but not in nucleoli.

Nagase et al. (2000) cloned a partial cDNA encoding 579 amino acids of
human CPSF2, which they called KIAA1367, from a fetal brain cDNA
library. The partial human protein is 99% identical to the 782-amino
acid bovine protein. RT-PCR analysis revealed ubiquitous but variable
expression of CPSF2, with highest levels in liver and testis.

MAPPING

Samiotaki et al. (2000) mapped the CPSF2 gene to 14q31.3 using radiation
hybrid analysis.

147572	TITLE *147572 INTERFERON-ALPHA-INDUCIBLE PROTEIN 6; IFI6
;;INTERFERON-INDUCED PROTEIN IFI-6-16; IFI616;;
G1P3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential screening of an alpha-interferon (IFNA; 147660)-induced
neuroblastoma cell cDNA library, followed by screening an IFNA-treated
Daudi lymphoblastoid cell cDNA library, Kelly et al. (1986) cloned IFI6,
which they called 6-16. The deduced 130-amino acid protein is
hydrophobic and contains an N-terminal signal peptide.

GENE FUNCTION

Kelly et al. (1986) showed that IFI6 was induced in HeLa cells by IFNA
and IFNB (147640). Following transfection in mouse cells, human IFI6 was
expressed in response to mouse Ifna and Ifnb, but not Ifng (147570),
with the same kinetics and dose response as in human cells.

Itzhaki and Porter (1991) reported a method for targeted disruption of
the IFI6 gene and detection by secretion of human growth hormone (GH1;
139250).

Cheriyath et al. (2007) showed that treatment of human myeloma cells
with IFN-alpha-2b (see IFNA2; 147562) for 24 hours antagonized TRAIL
(TNFSF10; 603598)-mediated apoptosis, but after 72 hours it augmented
TRAIL apoptotic activity. The antiapoptotic activity of IFN-alpha-2b was
associated with increased expression of G1P3. Ectopically expressed G1P3
localized to mitochondria and antagonized TRAIL-mediated mitochondrial
potential loss, cytochrome c release, and apoptosis. Conversely, RNA
interference-mediated downregulation of G1P3 restored
IFN-alpha-2b-induced apoptosis. Cheriyath et al. (2007) concluded that
curtailing G1P3-mediated antiapoptotic signals may improve therapies for
myeloma and other malignancies.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kelly et al. (1986) determined that the IFI6 gene contains 5 exons and
has a TATA box upstream of the transcription initiation site.

Porter et al. (1988) described the interferon response element of the
human IFI6 gene.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Clauss et al. (1990) mapped the IFI6
gene to chromosome 1.

Itzhaki et al. (1992) reported that the IFI6 gene maps to chromosome
1p35, based on the work of others using fluorescence in situ
hybridization. Itzhaki et al. (1992) used telomere-associated chromosome
fragmentation (TACF), a novel approach for chromosome mapping based on
the nontargeted introduction of clone telomeres into mammalian
chromosomes, to target telomeric DNA to the IFI6 gene on chromosome 1p.
They deduced that the IFI6 gene is oriented away from the centromere by
targeting telomeric DNA to the specific locus by homologous
recombination, using a selection strategy that imposed the requirement
that the telomeric DNA be oriented in the same direction as the IFI6
gene.
