DESCRIPTION The vertebrate class III POU transcription factors consist of 4 members:
POU3F1 (Oct6), POU3F2 (600494), POU3F3 (Brain-1), and POU3F4 (Brain-4;
300039). The chromosomal locations of the murine class III POU genes
were determined by interspecific backcross analysis (Avraham et al.,
1993; Xia et al., 1993). On the basis of mouse-human chromosomal
homologies, human POU3F1 and POU3F3 were expected to map to 1p and 2q,
respectively. Sumiyama et al. (1998) found that the location of POU3F1
was consistent with this position, mapping to 1p34.1 by FISH. Contrary
to the prediction, however, POU3F3 was mapped to 3p14.2 by the same
method. The human POU3F2 and POU3F4 genes map to 6q16 and Xq21.1,
respectively. Thus, the 4 human class III POU genes map to different
chromosomes. A phylogenetic tree of these 4 genes shows that they
emerged in a common ancestor of vertebrates. Studies of the genome
structure of vertebrates suggest that genome duplication occurred at
least twice in the early stage of vertebrate evolution; 4 homologous
complexes such as Hox and MHC are interspersed in the mammalian genome.
The findings with the 4 class III POU genes are consistent with the idea
of 2 genome duplications.

Xia et al. (1993) mapped the mouse homolog of the POU3F1 gene, called
Tst1 by them, to chromosome 4.

Most mice homozygous for a mutant Pou3f1 die soon after birth
(Bermingham et al., 1996; Jaegle et al., 1996). Bermingham et al. (1996)
and Jaegle et al. (1996) showed that sciatic nerves of Oct6 -/- mice
showed a delay in Schwann cell differentiation, with a transient arrest
at the promyelination stage before axonal wrapping, suggesting that Oct6
is required for the transition of promyelin cells to myelinating cells.
Arroyo et al. (1998) confirmed these findings and used
beta-galactosidase expression to show that promyelinating Schwann cells
expressed the highest levels of Oct6, both in developing and
regenerating nerves.

In rat sciatic nerves, Nickols et al. (2003) found that expression of
the activated p65 subunit (164014) of the transcription factor NFKB was
high in the nuclei of premyelinating Schwann cells and then
progressively declined until it was nearly absent in adults. NFKB
expression preceded and was necessary for the upregulation of Oct6. The
authors concluded that NFKB is upstream of Oct6 induction and is also
required for the formation of peripheral myelin.

Ghazvini et al. (2002) created mice with a Schwann cell-specific
deficiency in Oct6 expression. Mice homozygous for this deficiency were
viable but showed a delay in peripheral nerve development. In the
absence of Oct6, Krox20 (129010) expression was delayed but was
eventually activated at the time of extensive myelination. Sciatic nerve
regeneration following crush lesion was also delayed in the absence of
Oct6 gene function.

The transient nature of the Schwann cell defect in Oct6-deficient mice
observed by Ghazvini et al. (2002) suggested some redundancy in
transcription factor function during Schwann cell development. In
sciatic nerve extracts from chick embryos, young chicks, and mice,
Jaegle et al. (2003) showed that the POU transcription factor Brn2
(POU3F2; 600494) is expressed and regulated in developing Schwann cells
in a manner similar to that of Oct6, and that Brn2 gene activation does
not depend on Oct6. Overexpression of Brn2 in Oct6-deficient Schwann
cells of mice showed partial rescue of peripheral nerve developmental
delay with an increase in the number of actively myelinating Schwann
cells, suggesting that Brn2 can functionally substitute for Oct6 in
promoting the transition from promyelinating to myelinating Schwann
cells. Compound disruption of both Oct6 and Brn2 resulted in a much more
severe phenotype with abnormal nerve morphology. Jaegle et al. (2003)
concluded that Brn2 and Oct6 share roles as positive regulators of
Schwann cell development.
