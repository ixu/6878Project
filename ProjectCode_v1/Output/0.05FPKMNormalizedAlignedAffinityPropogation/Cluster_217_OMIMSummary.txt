605710	TITLE *605710 GDNF FAMILY RECEPTOR ALPHA-3; GFRA3
;;GLIAL CELL LINE-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR RECEPTOR ALPHA-3
DESCRIPTION Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF; 600837) and neurturin
(NRTN; 602018) promote the survival and maintenance of different
neuronal cell types. GDNF signals through a receptor complex composed of
a GDNF family receptor and the membrane-bound protein tyrosine-kinase
receptor RET (164761).

CLONING

Masure et al. (1998) and Baloh et al. (1998) identified a novel member
of the GDNF receptor family, GFRA3, by screening databases for sequences
similar to GFRA1 (601496) and GFRA2 (601956). Masure et al. (1998) found
that the full-length GFRA3 cDNA sequence encodes a 400-amino acid
protein with a putative 26-amino acid signal peptide, a C-terminal
hydrophobic region, and 3 potential N-glycosylation sites. GFRA3 shares
approximately 35% amino acid identity with GFRA1 and GFRA2. There is
conservation of 28 cysteines between all 3 family members, suggesting
that the disulfide bond pairing has been conserved. Both Masure et al.
(1998) and Baloh et al. (1998) determined that GFRA3, like GFRA1 and
GFRA2, is a multiply N-glycosylated protein that is
glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored to the cell surface. Masure
et al. (1998) identified N-glycosylated forms of GFRA3 ranging from 43
to 62 kD.

By Northern blot analysis, Masure et al. (1998) detected expression of
GFRA3 in human tissues as an approximately 2.3-kb transcript
predominantly in spinal cord, with weak expression in cerebellum; in
peripheral tissues, high expression was detected in colon, small
intestine, pancreas, heart, testis, and prostate. Additional 1.3- and
1.6-kb transcripts were detected in testis and pancreas. Using RT-PCR of
different brain regions, Masure et al. (1998) detected highest
expression in cerebellum and spinal cord, with little expression in
other brain areas. They confirmed expression of GFRA3 in cerebellum by
in situ hybridization. However, by Northern blot analysis, Baloh et al.
(1998) found no expression of GFRA3 in human whole brain or in any of 13
subdissected regions of the adult brain. They found expression in a wide
range of tissues, including the stomach, colon, small intestine,
appendix, and the urogenital system. By in situ hybridization of
embryonic day 14 mice, they detected expression of Gfra3 in developing
peripheral nerve, sensory ganglia, and sympathetic ganglia. Consistent
with their Northern blot data from human tissues, they found no
expression in mouse brain.

GENE FUNCTION

From studies in transfected fibroblasts, Baloh et al. (1998) concluded
that GFRA3 does not form a signaling receptor complex with RET for GDNF,
NRTN, or PSPN (602921). Baloh et al. (1998) determined that artemin
(ARTN; 603886), a novel member of the GDNF family, is a ligand for
GFRA3-RET.

GENE STRUCTURE

Onochie et al. (2000) characterized the structure of the human GFRA3
gene. The gene has 8 coding exons and a gene structure and organization
similar to that of GFRA1. The authors identified 3 polymorphic variants
in GFRA3 in a normal control population and found the same variants in
patients with Hirschsprung disease, but found no correlation between
these variants and the Hirschsprung disease phenotype.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Masure et al. (1998) and Baloh et
al. (1998) mapped the GFRA3 gene to 5q31.1-q31.3 and 5q31.2-q32,
respectively.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nishino et al. (1999) examined the role of Gfra3 in nervous system
development by generating mice with a disrupted Gfra3 gene. Mice lacking
functional Gfra3 exhibited severe defects in the superior cervical
ganglion (SCG), whereas other ganglia appeared normal. SCG precursor
cells in the mutant embryos failed to migrate to the correct position,
and they subsequently failed to innervate the target organs. After
birth, SCG neurons underwent progressive cell death. These observations
suggested that GFRA3-mediated signaling is required both for the rostral
migration of SCG precursors and for the survival of mature SCG neurons.

610781	TITLE *610781 GUANOSINE MONOPHOSPHATE REDUCTASE 2; GMPR2
;;GMP REDUCTASE 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching with the sequence of GMPR1 (GMPR; 139265) as
query, Deng et al. (2002) identified and subsequently cloned GMPR2 from
a human fetal brain cDNA library. The deduced 348-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 37.9 kD and shares 90% sequence identity
with GMPR1 and 69% identity with E. coli GMPR. Northern blot analysis
detected relatively high levels of both GMPR1 and GMPR2 in heart,
skeletal muscle, and kidney, and relatively low levels of both in colon,
thymus, and peripheral blood leukocyte. Strong signals of GMPR2 were
detected in brain, liver, and placenta, whereas weak signals of GMPR1
were observed in these tissues. The apparent Km of GMPR2 for NADPH and
GMP are 26.6 and 17.4 microM, respectively.

Zhang et al. (2003) cloned GMPR2 from a human dendritic cell cDNA
library. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of an
approximately 2.2-kb transcript, with high expression in testis, ovary,
prostate, heart, liver, spleen, skeletal muscle, and kidney. An
additional transcript of about 1.3 kb was detected in placenta.
Expression was also detected in most cancer cell lines studied.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2003) showed that recombinant GMPR2 protein was able to
reduce GMP. Transfection experiments demonstrated that overexpression of
GMPR2 promoted the monocytic differentiation of HL-60 leukemia cells.

EVOLUTION

Deng et al. (2002) presented evidence that the 2 types of GMP reductase
are derived from duplication of an ancient gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Deng et al. (2002) determined that the GMPR2 gene contains 10 exons and
spans more than 6.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Deng et al. (2002) mapped the GMPR2 gene
to chromosome 14p11.2-p11.1. By the same method, Zhang et al. (2003)
mapped the gene to chromosome 14q11-q21.

107266	TITLE *107266 CD22 ANTIGEN; CD22
;;B-CELL ANTIGEN CD22;;
SIALIC ACID-BINDING IMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE LECTIN 2; SIGLEC2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The human B-lymphocyte-restricted antigen CD22 is expressed early in
B-cell development in pro-B cells, as a cytoplasmic protein, and later
in B-cell development, at the late pre-B-cell stage, as a cell surface
protein. Once expressed as a membrane protein, CD22 persists on B cells
until they differentiate into plasma cells. The presence of cytoplasmic
CD22 is a useful marker for B-cell precursor acute lymphocytic leukemia.
CD22 appears to be a heterodimer consisting of 130- and 140-kD
glycoproteins with protein cores of 80 and 100 kD, respectively. The 2
subunits are thought to be independently transported to the surface and
originate from 2 separate precursor molecules. Studies of the structure
of the 2 proteins and cDNA cloning suggested that the 2 proteins arise
from differential RNA processing of the same gene, with the larger
subunit being composed of an extracellular portion of 7 immunoglobulin
domains, 1 V-like and 6 C-like, and a smaller subunit of 5 Ig domains, 1
V-like and 4 C-like. The CD22 polypeptide is structurally related to
myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG; 159460), neural cell adhesion
molecule (NCAM; 116930), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA; 114890).
Consistent with the structural similarities to the adhesion molecules,
CD22 participates in adhesion between B cells and other cell types.
Wilson et al. (1991) cloned a full-length cDNA corresponding to the
B-cell membrane protein CD22.

GENE FUNCTION

Nonhuman mammalian cells express N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and
N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). Human cells contain only Neu5Ac
because of an exon deletion/frameshift mutation in cytidine
monophospho-sialic acid hydroxylase (CMAH; 603209), which converts
Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins, or
SIGLECs, such as CD22 (SIGLEC2), recognize sialic acids. Brinkman-Van
der Linden et al. (2000) showed that human SIGLEC1 (SN; 600751) strongly
prefers Neu5Ac over Neu5Gc. Sequence analysis of SIGLEC2 cDNA found that
while the chimpanzee sequence is 97% homologous to human, bonobo and
gorilla are only 96% homologous, and the orangutan is only 93%
homologous. Using regions of SIGLEC2 proteins from mouse, chimpanzee,
orangutan, and human fused to the Fc region of human IgG, and flow
cytometry analysis, Brinkman-Van der Linden et al. (2000) showed that
all bound well to chimpanzee Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B
cells, which expressed high levels of Neu5Gc. Except for mouse, all
bound well to human EBV-transformed B cells, which expressed high levels
of Neu5Ac.

In a review of immune inhibitory receptors, Ravetch and Lanier (2000)
pointed out that autoimmune disorders may result from the disruption of
inhibitory receptors, particularly in their conserved intracellular
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). ITIMs are sites
for alternative phosphorylation, typically by a Src kinase, and
dephosphorylation, either by the tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 (176883) or
the inositol phosphatase SHIP (601582), transducing signals to distinct
pathways. Ravetch and Lanier (2000) noted that CD22 has ITIMs that
interact with SHP1 and oppose activation mediated by the B cell
receptor.

Using murine B-cell lines, Wakabayashi et al. (2002) demonstrated that
CD22 downmodulates signaling through the IgM and IgD B-cell receptors
(BCRs), but not through the IgG BCR, because the IgG cytoplasmic tail
prevents CD22 phosphorylation and actually enhances IgG-BCR signaling.
Wakabayashi et al. (2002) proposed that enhanced IgG-BCR signaling may
be involved in efficient IgG production, which is crucial for protective
immunity against pathogens.

Using yeast 2-hybrid and coprecipitation analyses, John et al. (2003)
found that tyr843 or tyr863 in the cytoplasmic tail of CD22 interacted
with AP50 (AP2M1; 601024), the medium chain subunit of the AP2 complex.
Studies on B cells showed that internalization of CD22 was dependent on
its association with the AP2 complex via tyrosine-based internalization
motifs.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wilson et al. (1993) used a nearly full-length cDNA clone of CD22 to
isolate genomic clones that spanned the gene. The gene covers 22 kb of
DNA and comprises 15 exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Wilson et al. (1993) showed that
the CD22 locus is located within band 19q13.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

O'Keefe et al. (1996) made observations in mice with a targeted
disruption of the CD22 gene indicating that CD22 is a negative regulator
of antigen receptor signaling whose onset of expression at the mature B
cell stage may serve to raise the antigen concentration threshold
required for B cell triggering. Splenic B cells from CD22 knockout mice
were found to be hyperresponsive to receptor signaling. Heightened
calcium fluxes and cell proliferation were obtained at lower ligand
concentrations. The mice gave augmented immune response, had an expanded
peritoneal B-1 cell population, and contained increased serum titers of
autoantibody.

Chen et al. (2004) expressed mouse Cd22 in mouse and chicken B-cell
lines devoid of Cd22 and examined B cells from mice deficient in Cd22 or
Pmca4 (108732). They identified an activation-dependent interaction
between phosphorylated Cd22 and Pmca4 and found that Cd22 together with
Shp1 (PTPN6; 176883) provided negative control of B-cell activation by
enhancing Pmca4-mediated calcium efflux after B-cell receptor
stimulation.

138320	TITLE *138320 GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE; GPX1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glutathione peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.9) catalyzes the reduction of organic
hydroperoxides and hydrogen peroxide by glutathione and thereby protects
against oxidative damage (summary by Cohen et al., 1989).

CLONING

Paglia and Valentine (1967) characterized red cell glutathione
peroxidase.

Sukenaga et al. (1987) presented the sequence of GPX cDNA. GPX is one of
only a few proteins known in higher vertebrates to contain
selenocysteine. This unusual amino acid occurs at the active site of GPX
and is coded by the nonsense (stop) codon TGA. Sequence analysis of cDNA
clones confirmed previous findings that the unusual amino acid
selenocysteine is encoded by the opal terminator codon UGA (Le Beau,
1989). (Note that TGA = UGA; they represent the cDNA and mRNA code,
respectively.) There appears to be a selenocysteyl-tRNA that donates
selenocysteine to the growing polypeptide chain of GPX, and therefore,
selenocysteine becomes the twenty-first naturally occurring amino acid.
A tRNA molecule that carries selenocysteine has its own translating
factor that delivers it to the translating ribosome (Bock et al., 1991).
Bacterial formate dehydrogenase also contains selenocysteine.

MAPPING

Wijnen et al. (1978) presented evidence that GPX1 is on chromosome 3.
Johannsmann et al. (1979) concluded that the GPX locus is on 3p. In situ
hybridization localized the gene to 3p13-q12 (Johannsmann et al., 1981).
McBride et al. (1988) used a cDNA probe to study DNAs isolated from
human-rodent somatic cell hybrids. A 609-bp probe containing the entire
coding region hybridized to human chromosomes 3, 21, and Xp. An intronic
probe detected only the gene on chromosome 3. The sequences on
chromosomes X and 21 showed equal conservation of the 3-prime
untranslated and coding sequences but did not contain introns,
suggesting that they represent processed pseudogenes.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and PCR analysis, Kiss et al.
(1997) mapped the GPX1 gene to 3p21.3. Their results were compatible
with the existence of a pseudogene of GPX1 on 3q11-q12 (Chada et al.,
1990).

Mehdizadeh et al. (1996) mapped the Gpx1 gene to mouse chromosome 9 in a
region of known conserved homology between mouse chromosome 9 and human
chromosome 3.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a radioimmunoassay for GSHPx, Takahashi et al. (1986) showed that
there is a direct relationship between GPX enzyme activity and enzyme
protein concentration. Thus, selenium is necessary for the synthesis of
protein. Selenium deficiency (see 614164) results in a decrease not only
in glutathione peroxidase activity but also in GSHPx protein. Only
erythrocytes formed in the presence of selenium contain GSHPx activity.
The possibility of confusing genetic and environmental factors is
indicated. Takahashi et al. (1987) observed a selenium-dependent GPX in
human plasma that is distinct from the one found in erythrocytes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By electrophoretic means, Beutler and West (1974) demonstrated
polymorphism of red cell glutathione peroxidase in Afro-Americans. An
electrophoretic polymorphism of glutathione peroxidase was described by
Beutler et al. (1974).

Beutler and Matsumoto (1975) found that persons of Jewish ancestry and
others of Mediterranean origin have a decrease in red cell GPX activity,
but not of leukocyte or fibroblast activity. Oriental populations showed
a significantly lower scatter in red cell enzyme levels in comparison
with Occidental populations. The authors suggested the existence of a
low GPX allele with a frequency of about 0.556 in the Jewish population
and 0.181 in the U.S.-Northern European population. They recommended
caution in assigning a cause-effect relationship to GPX deficiency
(614164) and hemolytic anemia.

Meera Khan et al. (1986) studied the genetics of red cell GPX1 in the
Djuka of Suriname. This group consists of descendants of captives from
the Gold Coast (Ghana) of Africa brought to Suriname during the 17th
century and of others probably from a wider region of West Africa
transported during the 18th century. During successive waves of revolt
and following the abolition of slavery, the Djuka escaped into the
interior of Suriname and organized themselves into groups which have
lived since then as permanent forest dwellers with little or no
extra-ethnic mixture. Meera Khan et al. (1986) found that the Djuka have
a frequency of the GPX1*2 allele of 0.054 and suggested that the GPX1*2
allele is an African marker. The only non-Africans in whom it is
presently found are Ashkenazi Jews living in the United States and the
Punjabis of the Indian subcontinent. It was proposed that both groups
independently acquired the variant allele through an ancient African
mixture. See Meera Khan et al. (1984).

The catalytic activity of GPX1 enzyme in the 2-1 heterozygote is greater
than that in the 1-1 homozygote. It may be that individuals with the
higher peroxidase activity have an intraerythrocytic environment which
is less favorable for the survival of the falciparum parasite and
therefore that the 2-1 heterozygote enjoys a selective advantage in a
malarious environment. Meera Khan et al. (1986) referred to the
electrophoretic variants as electrotypes.

Shen et al. (1994) reported variation in vivo and instability in vitro
of an in-frame GCG trinucleotide repeat in the GPX1 gene. In a
population study of 110 alleles from 55 unrelated persons, the allele
frequencies for 4, 5, and 6 GCG repeats were 0.40, 0.35, and 0.25,
respectively. No allele was associated with diminished enzyme activity.
Current stocks of HL-60 cells, a human myeloid leukemia cell line, were
found to be homozygous for the 6-repeat allele. The expansion of the
repeat appears to have developed in the course of multiple passages of
the rapidly proliferating cell line because cells frozen in 1976 showed
a 4/6 genotype and 'intermediate' passage cells frozen in 1985 contained
both 4/6 and 5/6 genotypes.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

ANIMAL MODEL

De Haan et al. (1998) demonstrated a role for GPX1 in protection against
oxidative stress by showing that Gpx1 -/- mice are highly sensitive to
the oxidant paraquat. Lethality was detected within 24 hours in mice
exposed to paraquat at 10 mg/kg(-1), approximately 1/7 of the LD50 of
wildtype controls. The effects of paraquat were dose-related. De Haan et
al. (1998) further demonstrated that paraquat transcriptionally
upregulates Gpx1 in normal cells, reinforcing a role for GPX1 in
protection against paraquat toxicity. Cortical neurons from Gpx1 -/-
mice are more susceptible to peroxide; 30% of neurons from
Gpx1-deficient mice were killed when exposed to 65 micromolar peroxide,
whereas the wildtype controls were unaffected. De Haan et al. (1998)
stated that their data established function for GPX1 in protection
against some oxidative stressors and in protection of neurons against
peroxide.

Reddy et al. (2001) studied the functional role of GPX1 activity in
antioxidant mechanisms of lens in vivo by comparing lens changes of Gpx1
knockout mice with age-matched control animals. Slit-lamp images showed
increased nuclear light scattering (NLS) in Gpx1 knockout mice compared
with control animals. Transmission electron microscopy revealed changes
in the nucleus manifested by waviness of fiber membranes as early as 3
weeks of age. The Gpx1 knockout mice developed mature cataracts after 15
months. Reddy et al. (2001) concluded that their results demonstrated
the critical role of GPX1 in antioxidant defense mechanisms of the lens
nucleus. The increased NLS appeared to be associated with damage to
nuclear fiber membranes, which might have been due to formation of lipid
peroxides, which serve as substrates for GPX1. Cataract formation
appeared to progress from focal opacities, apparent at an early age, to
lamellar cataracts between 6 and 10 months, and finally to complete
opacification in animals older than 15 months.

Shiomi et al. (2004) created myocardial infarction by left coronary
artery ligation in mice overexpressing Gpx1 in the heart and wildtype
mice. Although infarct size was comparable, the transgenic mice had an
increased survival rate with decreased left ventricular dilatation,
dysfunction, and end-diastolic pressure compared to wildtype mice. The
improvement in left ventricular function was accompanied by a decrease
in myocyte hypertrophy, apoptosis, and interstitial fibrosis in the
noninfarcted left ventricle. Shiomi et al. (2004) concluded that
overexpression of Gpx1 protects the heart against post-myocardial
infarction remodeling and heart failure in mice.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE POLYMORPHISM
GPX1, PRO197LEU

Forsberg et al. (1999) searched the human EST database to determine new
polymorphisms in the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (see
147450), glutathione peroxidases, catalase (115500), and microsomal
glutathione transferase-1 (138330). When any mutation, indicated by the
search, gave rise to a nonconservative amino acid change, they performed
PCR restriction analysis and/or sequence analysis of genomic DNA from
human subjects in order to verify these potential polymorphisms. In this
way, they identified a pro197-to-leu substitution in the GPX1 gene,
resulting from a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 593. The corresponding
allele frequencies were approximately 70% for pro197 and 30% for leu197.

606286	TITLE *606286 DEAD/H BOX 43; DDX43
;;HELICASE ANTIGEN; HAGE
DESCRIPTION For background information on tumor antigens recognized by cytolytic T
lymphocytes, see SAGE (300359).

CLONING

To identify genes with tumor-specific expression, Martelange et al.
(2000) applied a cDNA subtraction approach, i.e., representational
difference analysis, to a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. They
obtained 2 cDNAs that appeared to be tumor specific and named the
corresponding genes SAGE and HAGE because they had the same pattern of
expression as genes of the MAGE family (e.g., MAGEA1; 300016). The
putative HAGE protein contains 648 amino acids and is a member of the
DEAD box family of ATP-dependent RNA helicases (see 600396). Northern
blot analysis detected expression of a 2.2-kb HAGE transcript in tumors
of various histologic types at a level that was 100-fold higher than
that observed in normal tissues, except for testis.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Martelange et al. (2000) mapped the HAGE
gene to 6q12-q13.

605515	TITLE *605515 FORKHEAD BOX P1; FOXP1
;;GLUTAMINE-RICH FACTOR 1; QRF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FOXP1 is a transcriptional repressor that plays a critical role in
monocyte differentiation and macrophage function (Shi et al., 2008).

CLONING

Li and Tucker (1993) cloned a glutamine-rich factor, which they
designated QRF1, that was expressed preferentially at the terminal
differentiation stage of B cells and in skeletal muscle. The deduced
707-amino acid QRF1 protein contains an 84-amino acid segment that shows
significant sequence homology with the DNA-binding domains of the
hepatocyte nuclear factor-3/forkhead (see FOXA1; 602294) family of
proteins.

By expression cloning using blood and testis cDNA libraries to identify
the target of a monoclonal antibody (JC12), Banham et al. (2001)
obtained a full-length cDNA encoding FOXP1. The predicted 677-amino acid
protein contains coiled-coil, glutamine-rich, and serine/threonine-rich
domains in its N-terminal half; a central zinc finger domain; and
coiled-coil, serine/threonine/proline-rich, winged helix, and acidic
domains in its C-terminal half. FOXP1 also has numerous putative
phosphorylation sites, 2 nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in its
C-terminal half, and 2 PEST motif in its C-terminal acidic region.
Multiple-tissue array analysis showed ubiquitous expression of FOXP1 in
normal adult and fetal tissues, with highest expression in lymphoid and
gastrointestinal tissues. Immunohistochemistry showed that FOXP1 protein
was widely expressed, with a predominantly nuclear localization, in
normal tissues.

Wang et al. (2003) stated that there are 4 splice variants of mouse
Foxp1, designated Foxp1a through Foxp1d. They identified and cloned
Foxp1d, which encodes a Foxp1 isoform lacking the N-terminal
polyglutamine domain found in Foxp1a and Foxp1b. Northern blot analysis
and RNase protection assays showed tissue-specific expression of all 4
variants in mouse. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected
tissue-specific expression of FOXP1 variants, with highest levels in
peripheral blood lymphocytes and in caudate nucleus of brain. Western
blot analysis detected variable expression of Foxp1a, Foxp1c, and Foxp1d
in mouse tissues, with high expression of all 3 isoforms in lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2003) found that mouse Foxp1a, Foxp1c, Foxp1d, and the
related Foxp2 (605317) protein bound a 7-nucleotide core sequence,
TATTT(G/A)T. These Foxp proteins repressed gene transcription via
binding to this consensus site, which was identified within the SV40 and
IL2 (147680) promoters. In some cases, the strength of Foxp1 repression
was mediated by the polyglutamine domain. Mouse Foxp1 proteins also
formed homodimers or heterodimers with subfamily members, and the
conserved C2H2 zinc finger and leucine zipper motifs mediated
dimerization.

Using genetic manipulations, Rousso et al. (2008) demonstrated that
Foxp1 established the pattern of LIM-homeodomain protein (see 601999)
expression in embryonic mice and, accordingly, organized motor axon
projections, their connectivity with peripheral targets, and the
establishment of motor pools. Hox proteins (see 142950) dictated the
pattern of Foxp1 expression in spinal cord, and both Foxp1 and Hox were
required for segment-appropriate generation of motor columns and pools
in mouse.

Shi et al. (2008) generated transgenic mice overexpressing human FOXP1
in monocyte/macrophage lineage cells. Circulating blood monocytes from
these mice had reduced expression of macrophage colony-stimulating
factor receptor (CSF1R; 164770), impaired migratory capacity, and
diminished accumulation as splenic macrophages. Macrophage functions
were globally impaired, and osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption were
attenuated. Forced overexpression of Csf1r reversed many of the
deficits, suggesting that repression of Csf1r is likely the dominant
mechanism responsible for FOXP1 effects on monocyte differentiation and
macrophage function.

- Association of FOXP1 With Cancer

By analysis of a tumor/normal tissue expression array, Banham et al.
(2001) found that expression of FOXP1 was lower in colon tumors and
higher in stomach and prostate tumors compared with matched normal
tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis showed frequent loss of
expression, increased expression, and cytoplasmic mislocalization of the
predominantly nuclear FOXP1 protein in solid tumors.

By immunohistochemical analysis of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (BCL)
tissue microarray, Banham et al. (2005) found that untreated patients
with a high percentage of FOXP1-positive nuclei had significantly
reduced survival and earlier progression compared with FOXP1-negative
patients.

Of 275 BCLs, Haralambieva et al. (2005) found that only 5 (3
gastrointestinal, 1 thyroid, and 1 cervical lymph node) carried a
chromosomal breakpoint in the FOXP1 gene and strong nuclear FOXP1
expression. All were diffuse large BCLs rather than marginal zone BCLs.
Haralambieva et al. (2005) concluded that genetic alterations at 3p13
are associated with strong FOXP1 expression.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Banham et al. (2001) mapped the FOXP1 gene
to chromosome 3p14.1.

CYTOGENETICS

Streubel et al. (2005) noted that 3 chromosomal translocations,
t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(14;18)(q32;q21), and t(1;14)(p22;q32), are
associated with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. They
identified a t(3;14)(p14;q32) in a case of MALT lymphoma of the thyroid.
FISH studies showed that the IGH locus (147100) was rearranged, and
long-distance inverse PCR identified FOXP1 as the partner gene on
chromosome 3. Using FISH assays to screen 91 MALT lymphomas negative for
3 common translocations, Streubel et al. (2005) identified
t(3;14)(p14;q32) in 9 cases (3 thyroid, 4 ocular adnexa, and 2 skin).
Most t(3;14)(p14;q32)-positive MALT lymphomas also harbored additional
genetic abnormalities, such as trisomy 3. All 4 of the MALT-associated
translocations were mutually exclusive. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed
upregulated expression of FOXP1 in MALT cases with t(3;14)(p14;q32) or
trisomy 3. Streubel et al. (2005) concluded that FOXP1 is a
translocation partner of IGH in a site-dependent subset of MALT
lymphomas.

Carr et al. (2010) reported a boy with severe speech delay and delayed
motor development (see 613670) who carried a de novo heterozygous 1.0-Mb
interstitial deletion of chromosome 3p14.1 that involved only the FOXP1
gene. The phenotype was confounded by a Chiari I malformation, which was
surgically corrected at age 30 months. The patient had delayed gross
motor skills and walked at 16 months. After surgery for the Chiari
malformation, he had some improvement in motor skills. The most
significant feature was speech delay with limited verbal output and
difficulty in articulating entire words and multisyllabic speech,
although he did not have a deficit in oromotor coordination. At age 4
years, he developed staring spells with motor arrest associated with
epileptiform discharges. He had mild dysmorphic facial features,
including broad forehead, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral
fissures, ptosis, short nose, broad nasal tip, and smooth philtrum. Carr
et al. (2010) concluded that FOXP1 may play a role in the development of
verbal and motor skills.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hamdan et al. (2010) identified 2 different de novo heterozygous
mutations in the FOXP1 gene (605515.0001 and 605515.0002, respectively)
in 2 unrelated children of French Canadian origin with moderate mental
retardation, expressive language deficits, and autistic features
(613670). The first mutation (605515.0001) was a small deletion found
using array-based comparative genomic hybridization of a cohort of 80
patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 30 with intellectual
disability. The second mutation (R525X; 605515.0002) was found by direct
sequencing of the FOXP1 gene in a cohort of 110 patients with
intellectual disability, 84 with ASD, and 51 with both. Hamdan et al.
(2010) chose to examine the FOXP1 gene specifically because of the role
of the FOXP2 gene (605317) in a speech and language disorder (SPCH1;
602081); patients with intellectual disability and ASD often show
language impairment. The results indicated that disruption of FOXP1 has
a global impact on brain development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hu et al. (2006) found that mice lacking Foxp1 died at embryonic day
14.5 due to heart valve and outflow tract abnormalities. Reconstitution
of Rag2 (179616)-deficient mice with Foxp1 -/- or Foxp1 +/- fetal liver
cells resulted in decreased mature B cells, but normal thymocytes, in
the recipients. Foxp1 -/- pro-B cells had reduced IgM, Rag1 (179615),
and Rag2 expression, and V(D)J rearrangement was also impaired in Foxp1
-/- B cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and EMSA analyses showed that
Foxp1 bound to Foxp site-2 (Fkh2) in the Erag enhancer, which is
upstream of Rag2, in a B-lineage specific way. Hu et al. (2006)
concluded that FOXP1 influences B-cell development at an early stage,
and that FOXP1 deficiency results in a phenotype that resembles double
haploinsufficiency of E2A (TCF3; 147141) and EBF (164343).

Feng et al. (2010) generated mice with a conditional deletion of Foxp1
in double-positive thymocytes and found that peripheral Cd4 (see 186940)
and Cd8 (see 186910) cells also lacked Foxp1 and that single-positive
thymocytes acquired an activated phenotype in thymus. Peripheral cells
also exhibited an activated phenotype and increased apoptosis and
readily produced cytokines upon T-cell receptor engagement. Feng et al.
(2010) concluded that FOXP1 is an essential transcriptional regulator
for thymocyte development and the generation of quiescent naive T cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION WITH LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT AND AUTISTIC FEATURES
FOXP1, 390-KB DEL

In a French Canadian girl who had mental retardation with language
impairment and autistic features (613670), Hamdan et al. (2010)
identified a de novo heterozygous 390-kb intragenic deletion in the
FOXP1 gene. The deletion encompassed exons 4 to 14 of the longest FOXP1
isoform, including the translation initiation site and leucine zipper
and zinc finger domains important for transcriptional activity.

.0002
MENTAL RETARDATION WITH LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT AND AUTISTIC FEATURES
FOXP1, ARG525TER

In a French Canadian boy who had mental retardation with language
impairment and autistic features (613670), Hamdan et al. (2010)
identified a de novo heterozygous 1573C-T transition in the FOXP1 gene,
resulting in an arg525-to-ter (R525X) substitution. The mutation was
predicted to abolish the last 152 residues of the protein, including
part of the forkhead DNA-binding (FHD) domain and a conserved nuclear
localization signal. The mutation was not found in 570 controls. In
vitro functional expression studies in HEK293 cells showed that the
R525X mutant impaired the transcriptional repression ability of FOXP1,
consistent with a loss of function.

CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to AKAP95 (AKAP8; 604692), followed
by 5-prime RACE of a skeletal muscle cDNA library and screening an
amnion cell cDNA library, Orstavik et al. (2000) cloned AKAP8L, which
they designated HA95. The deduced 646-amino acid protein shares 61%
homology with AKAP95. Northern blot analysis showed ubiquitous and
uniform expression of a 5.0-kb HA95 transcript. The N-terminal half of
HA95 localized to the nucleus during interphase in a transfected human
lymphoma cell line.

Seki et al. (2000) cloned AKAP8L, which they designated NAKAP95, from a
fetal brain cDNA library. The deduced 646-amino acid protein shares 30%
identity with AKAP95. Both contain 2 C2H2-type zinc finger motifs at
similar positions and a nuclear localization signal, but NAKAP95 lacks
the protein kinase A (PKA; see 176911)-binding motif found in AKAP95.
PCR analysis detected NAPAK95 in all tissues examined.

Using the C-terminal domain of RNA helicase A (RHA, or DDX9; 603115) as
bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a leukocyte cDNA library, followed by
screening a T-cell lymphoma cell line, Westberg et al. (2000) cloned
AKAP8L, which they designated HAP95. The predicted protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 72 kD, but SDS-PAGE showed an apparent
molecular mass of about 100 kD. The N terminus of HAP95 contains both
tandem and nontandem YG dipeptide repeats, followed by 3 FG repeats and
a central nuclear localization signal. The C-terminal half contains 2
zinc finger motifs and 2 proline-rich SH3-binding domains. Northern blot
analysis detected transcripts of 2.0 and 4.0 kb in all cell lines
examined. Fluorescence-tagged HAP95 primarily localized to the nucleus
of transfected HeLa cells, with exclusion from nucleoli. Heterokaryon
assays indicated that HAP95 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged proteins, Orstavik et al.
(2000) found that HA95 interacted with itself, but not with AKAP95.

By coimmunoprecipitation of transfected HeLa cells, Westberg et al.
(2000) confirmed that HAP95 interacts with the C-terminal domain of RHA.
HAP95 also interacted with the type D retrovirus constitutive transport
element (CTE), which mediates nuclear export of unspliced viral
transcripts, in transfected human embryonic kidney cells. CTE RNA
immunoprecipitated with HAP95 and with TAP (NXF1; 602647). HAP95
overexpression upregulated CTE-dependent gene expression, but it had no
effect on general gene expression or expression mediated by the Rev/Rev
response element of human immunodeficiency virus-1.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Sayer et al. (2005) found that mouse Hypa
(PRPF40A; 612941) interacted with human NAKAP. Deletion mapping
indicated that the binding occurred via a proline-rich domain of NAKAP
and the WW domain of Hypa. In human embryonic kidney cells, NAKAP and
HYPA localized within the nucleus and copurified with the nuclear
matrix. NAKAP associated with HYPA in normal human brain, and both
proteins copurified with a portion of huntingtin (613004) protein in
Huntington disease (143100) brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Orstavik et al. (2000) determined that the coding region of the AKAP8L
gene contains 14 exons and spans about 37 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Orstavik et al. (2000) mapped the AKAP8L
gene maps to chromosome 19p13.1 immediately upstream of the AKAP95 gene.
The 2 genes are oriented in tandem on the same DNA strand and lie about
280 bp apart.

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, Seki et al. (2000)
mapped the AKAP8L gene to chromosome 19p13.12-p13.11.

180246	TITLE *180246 RETINOID X RECEPTOR, BETA; RXRB
DESCRIPTION The retinoic acid receptors, alpha (RARA; 180240), beta (RARB; 180220),
and gamma (RARG; 180190), require coregulators to bind effectively to
response elements and target genes. By a strategy of sequential
screening of expression libraries with a retinoic acid response element
and RAR, Yu et al. (1991) identified a cDNA encoding a coregulator
highly related to RXR-alpha (180245). This protein, termed RXR-beta,
formed heterodimers with RAR, preferentially increasing its DNA binding
and transcriptional activity on promoters containing retinoic acid, but
not thyroid hormone or vitamin D, response elements. Remarkably,
RXR-beta also heterodimerized with thyroid hormone and vitamin D
receptors, increasing both DNA binding and transcriptional function on
their respective response elements. RXR-alpha also formed heterodimers
with these receptors. These observations suggested that retinoid X
receptors meet the criteria for biochemically characterized cellular
coregulators and serve to target selectively the high affinity binding
of retinoic acid, thyroid hormone, and vitamin D receptors to their
cognate DNA response elements.

RARB, RARG, RXRB, and RXRG (180247) are expressed in the striatum. To
study the effect of these genes on locomotion, Kreczel et al. (1998)
developed single and double knockout mice and analyzed their locomotor
skills by open field and rotarod testing. RARB-RXRB, RARB-RXRG, and
RXRB-RXRG double-null mutant mice, but not the corresponding single-null
mutants, exhibited reductions in forward locomotion when compared with
wildtype littermates. Forty percent of the RARB-RXRB-null mutants showed
backward locomotion. Rotarod test performance was impaired for RARB,
RARB-RXRB, RARB-RXRG, and RXRB-RXRG mice. In contrast, RARA, RARG,
RARA-RXRG, and RARG-RXRG-null mice showed no defects in locomotion, even
though both RARA and RARG are also expressed in the striatum. The
morphology, development, and function of skeletal muscle, peripheral
nerves, and spinal cord were normal in all single and double-null
mutants, as were balance reflexes. These results suggested to Kreczel et
al. (1998) that RARB, RXRB, and RXRG are involved specifically in the
control of locomotor behaviors, and that heterodimers of RARB with
either RXRB or RXRG are the functional receptor units, such that RXRB
and RXRG are functionally redundant. Kreczel et al. (1998) studied the
expression of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors (D1R; 126449 and D2R;
126450), the most abundant dopamine receptors in the striatum, in these
mutant mice. RARB-RXRB, RARB-RXRG, and RXRB-RXRG double-null mutants,
but not RARB or RXRG single mutants, exhibited 40% and 30% reduction in
whole-striatal D1R and D2R transcripts, respectively, when compared with
wildtype controls. The reduction was mostly in the medioventral regions
of the striatum, including the shell and core of the nucleus accumbens,
and the mediodorsal part of the caudate putamen. The reduction was not
due to loss of D2R-expressing neurons; no increase in apoptosis was
noted. The histology of the striatum was normal. The characterization of
a retinoic acid response element in the D2R promoter by Samad et al.
(1997) led Kreczel et al. (1998) to suggest that the reduction in D2R
and D2R expression occurs on a transcriptional level. The RARB-RXRB,
RARB-RXRG, and RXRB-RXRG double-null mutants did not exhibit the normal
increase in locomotion induced by cocaine, mimicking the phenotype of
D1R-null mice. Taken together, these results indicated to Kreczel et al.
(1998) that retinoids are involved in controlling the function of the
dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway and suggested that defects in retinoic
acid signaling may contribute to disorders such as Parkinson disease and
schizophrenia.

Using RFLVs in interspecific backcross mice, Hoopes et al. (1992) mapped
the Rxrb gene to the H-2 region of chromosome 17. By homology, it is
likely that the RXRB gene in the human is located on 6p. Fleischhauer et
al. (1993) demonstrated that this is indeed the case. They showed that
the RXRB gene is located in the 6pter-q13 region by Southern
hybridization of genomic DNA from human/rodent cell hybrids with the
mouse gene as a probe. In addition, a full-length cDNA clone encoding a
human RXRB was isolated by nucleic acid screening of a human cDNA
library with a fragment of the mouse gene as a probe. Comparison of
human and murine RXRB showed 97.6% identity on the amino acid level and
91.6% on the nucleotide level. With the relatively crude mapping methods
used, Fleischhauer et al. (1993) could not map RXRB more precisely than
to the short arm of chromosome 6 and/or the proximal part of the long
arm; however, the findings are at least consistent with location in the
HLA region, as suggested by homology. Fitzgibbon et al. (1993) mapped
the RXRB gene to 6p21.3-p21.1 by PCR amplification of 5-prime
untranslated sequence in panels of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids and
to 6p21.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. By pairwise
hybridization of an RXRB cosmid and reference markers in fluorescence in
situ hybridization, Almasan et al. (1994) likewise mapped the RXRB gene
to 6p21.3. Using cosmid clones that cover the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) region, Nagata et al. (1995) determined the precise
physical map positions of the RXRB gene relative to the MHC genes in
mouse and human. Conservation of gene organization was observed between
the 2 species at the HLA-DP (142880) region.

In an elegant series of experiments designed to understand the effect of
RXR activation on cholesterol balance, Repa et al. (2000) treated
animals with the rexinoid LG268. Animals treated with rexinoid exhibited
marked changes in cholesterol balance, including inhibition of
cholesterol absorption and repressed bile acid synthesis. Studies with
receptor-selective agonists revealed that oxysterol receptors (LXRs, see
602423 and 600380) and the bile acid receptor, FXR (603826), are the RXR
heterodimeric partners that mediate these effects by regulating
expression of the reverse-cholesterol transporter, ABC1 (600046), and
the rate-limiting enzyme of bile acid synthesis, CYP7A1 (118455),
respectively. These RXR heterodimers serve as key regulators in
cholesterol homeostasis by governing reverse cholesterol transport from
peripheral tissues, bile acid synthesis in liver, and cholesterol
absorption in intestine. Activation of RXR/LXR heterodimers inhibits
cholesterol absorption by upregulation of ABC1 expression in the small
intestine. Activation of RXR/FXR heterodimers represses CYP7A1
expression and bile acid production, leading to a failure to solubilize
and absorb cholesterol. Studies have shown that RXR/FXR-mediated
repression of CYP7A1 is dominant over RXR/LXR-mediated induction of
CYP7A1, which explains why the rexinoid represses rather than activates
CYP7A1 (Lu et al., 2000). Activation of the LXR signaling pathway
results in the upregulation of ABC1 in peripheral cells, including
macrophages, to efflux free cholesterol for transport back to the liver
through high density lipoprotein, where it is converted to bile acids by
the LXR-mediated increase in CYP7A1 expression. Secretion of biliary
cholesterol in the presence of increased bile acid pools normally
results in enhanced reabsorption of cholesterol; however, with the
increased expression of ABC1 and efflux of cholesterol back into the
lumen, there is a reduction in cholesterol absorption and net excretion
of cholesterol and bile acid. Rexinoids therefore offer a novel class of
agents for treating elevated cholesterol.

600849	TITLE *600849 NUCLEAR RECEPTOR COREPRESSOR 1; NCOR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Thyroid hormone receptor (THR1; 190160) and retinoic acid receptor
(RARA, 180240; RARB, 180220; RARG, 180190) exert their regulatory
functions by acting as both activators and repressors of gene
expression. Horlein et al. (1995) identified a mouse cDNA for a nuclear
receptor corepressor (Ncor) of relative molecular mass 270,000 that
mediates ligand-independent inhibition of gene transcription by Thr1 and
Rars. Their finding suggested that the molecular mechanisms of
repression by thyroid hormone and retinoic acid receptors are analogous
to the corepressor-dependent transcriptional inhibitory mechanisms of
yeast and Drosophila. They suggested that the corepressor is a member of
a new gene family, which they termed TRAC (thyroid hormone- and retinoic
acid receptor-associated corepressor).

GENE FUNCTION

Grignani et al. (1998) demonstrated that both PML-RAR-alpha (see 102578)
and PLZF-RAR-alpha (see 176797) fusion proteins recruit the NCOR-histone
deacetylase (see 601241) complex through the RAR-alpha CoR box.
PLZF-RAR-alpha contains a second, retinoic acid-resistant binding site
in the PLZF amino-terminal region. High doses of retinoic acid release
histone deacetylase activity from PML-RAR-alpha, but not from
PLZF-RAR-alpha. Mutation of the NCOR binding site abolishes the ability
of PML-RAR-alpha to block differentiation, whereas inhibition of histone
deacetylase activity switches the transcriptional and biologic effects
of PLZF-RAR-alpha from being an inhibitor to an activator of the
retinoic acid signaling pathway. Therefore, Grignani et al. (1998)
concluded that recruitment of histone deacetylase is crucial to the
transforming potential of APL fusion proteins, and the different effects
of retinoic acid on the stability of the PML-RAR-alpha and
PLZF-RAR-alpha corepressor complexes determines the differential
response of APLs to retinoic acid.

Binding of ligand to nuclear hormone receptors induces a conformation
that attracts coactivator proteins containing a Leu-x-x-Leu-Leu motif,
the so-called NR box. Hu and Lazar (1999) showed that NCOR1 and SMRT
(600848) contain sequences that are similar to the NR box and are
repeated in each of 2 nuclear hormone receptor interaction domains. Hu
and Lazar (1999) called this box (L/I-x-x-I/V-I) the 'corner box,' or
CoRNR box (for 'corepressor/nuclear receptor box'). The CoRNR box is
required for nuclear hormone receptor interaction, and the CoRNR box
peptides specifically block corepressor interaction in vitro and
repression in vivo. Sequences flanking the CoRNR box determine nuclear
hormone receptor specificity. Thus, Hu and Lazar (1999) concluded that
the key feature of hormone action, differential recognition of
unliganded and liganded nuclear hormone receptors by coactivators and
corepressors, is due to very subtle differences between CoRNR and NR
boxes.

Baek et al. (2002) demonstrated that interleukin-1-beta (IL1B; 147720)
causes nuclear export of a specific NCOR corepressor complex, resulting
in derepression of a specific subset of nuclear factor-kappa-B (NFKB;
see 164011)-regulated genes. These genes are exemplified by the
tetraspanin KAI1 (600623), which regulates membrane receptor function.
Nuclear export of the NCOR/TAB2 (605101)/HDAC3 (605166) complex by IL1B
is temporally linked to selective recruitment of a TIP60 (601409)
coactivator complex. KAI1 is also directly activated by a ternary
complex, dependent on the acetyltransferase activity of TIP60, that
consists of the presenilin-dependent C-terminal cleavage product of the
beta amyloid precursor protein (APP; 104760), FE65 (602709), and TIP60,
identifying a specific in vivo gene target of an APP-dependent
transcription complex in the brain.

Zhang et al. (2002) reported that GPS2 (601935), a protein involved in
intracellular signaling, is an integral subunit of the NCOR1 NCOR1-HDAC3
complex. They determined structural motifs that direct the formation of
a highly stable and active deacetylase complex. GPS2 and TBL1 (300196),
another component of the NCOR1-HDAC3 complex, interact cooperatively
with repression domain-1 of NCOR1 to form a heterotrimeric structure and
are indirectly linked to HDAC3 via an extended NCOR1 SANT domain that
also activates latent HDAC3 activity. Zhang et al. (2002) also showed
that the NCOR1-HDAC3 complex inhibits JNK (601158) activation through
the associated GPS2 subunit and thus could potentially provide an
alternative mechanism for hormone-mediated antagonism of AP1 (165160)
function.

Yoon et al. (2003) purified NCOR complexes, which contained 10 to 12
proteins, from HeLa cell nuclear extracts and characterized the
interactions of TBL1 and TBLR1 (608628) with NCOR. TBL1 and TBLR1
interacted with NCOR through 2 independent interactions. Their
N-terminal regions interacted with the RD1 region of NCOR, and their
C-terminal WD40 repeats interacted with the RD4 region of NCOR. In
vitro, TBL1 and TBLR1 also bound histones H2B (see 609904) and H4 (see
602822), and transcriptional repression by TBL1 and TBLR1 correlated
with their interactions with histones. Using small interfering RNAs,
Yoon et al. (2003) demonstrated that HDAC3 was essential for repression
by unliganded thyroid hormone receptor. TBL1 and TBLR1 were also
essential, but they were functionally redundant.

Virtually all neural stem cells maintain an undifferentiated state and
the capacity to self-renew in response to fibroblast growth factor-2
(FGF2; 134920). Hermanson et al. (2002) reported that NCOR, a repressor
or transcription, is a principal regulator in neural stem cells, since
FGF2-treated embryonic cortical progenitors from NCOR gene-disrupted
mice displayed impaired self-renewal and spontaneous differentiation
into astroglia-like cells. Stimulation of wildtype neural stem cells
with ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF; 118945), a
differentiation-inducing cytokine, resulted in a
phosphatidyl-inositol-3-OH kinase/Akt1 kinase-dependent (see 164730)
phosphorylation of NCOR, and caused a temporally correlated
redistribution of NCOR to the cytoplasm. Hermanson et al. (2002)
observed that this is a critical strategy for cytokine-induced astroglia
differentiation and lineage-characteristic gene expression. Recruitment
of protein phosphatase-1 (see 176875) to a specific binding site on NCOR
exerted a reciprocal effect on the cellular localization of NCOR.
Hermanson et al. (2002) proposed that repression by NCOR, modulated by
opposing enzymatic activities, is a critical mechanism in neural stem
cells that underlies the inhibition of glial differentiation.

Using transfected mouse and human cells, Sardi et al. (2006) found that,
upon NRG1 (142445)-induced activation and presenilin (PSEN1;
104311)-dependent cleavage of ERBB4 (600543), the ERBB4 intracellular
domain formed a complex with TAB2 and NCOR. This complex translocated to
the nucleus of undifferentiated rat neural precursors and inhibited
their differentiation into astrocytes by repressing transcription of
glial genes. Consistent with this observation, cortical astrogenesis
occurred precociously in Erbb4-knockout mice, and this phenotype could
be rescued by reexpression of a cleavable isoform of human ERBB4, but
not by reexpression of an uncleavable ERBB4 isoform.

MAPPING

Using a mapped bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing 158 kb
of genomic NCOR1, Ordentlich et al. (1999) mapped the human NCOR1 gene
to chromosome 11p11.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Jepsen et al. (2000) generated mice with targeted disruption of the
Ncor1 gene. Altered patterns of transcription in tissues and cells
derived from Ncor1-deficient mice and the resulting block at specific
points in central nervous system, erythrocyte, and thymocyte development
indicated that NCOR1 is a required component of short-term active
repression by nuclear receptors and MAD (600021) and of a subset of
long-term repression events mediated by REST (600571). Unexpectedly,
NCOR1 and HDAC3 were also required for transcriptional activation of 1
class of retinoic acid response element. Together, these findings
suggested that specific combinations of corepressors and histone
deacetylases mediate the gene-specific actions of DNA-bound repressors
in development of multiple organ systems.

Alenghat et al. (2008) created a knockin mouse model in which a missense
mutation, Y478A, was introduced into the Ncor1 deacetylase activation
domain (DAD). This created a mutant protein that was stable but unable
to associate with or activate Hdac3. The DADm mice were viable, born at
normal mendelian frequencies, and morphologically indistinguishable from
wildtype littermates at birth. Thus, Ncor1 binding to Hdac3 is not
required for normal development, and the embryonic defects of mice
lacking Ncor1 are due to factors other than, or in addition to, Hdac3
recruitment by Ncor1. However, the DADm mice had aberrant regulation of
clock genes and had abnormal circadian behavior. These mice were leaner
and more insulin-sensitive owing to increased energy expenditure.
Unexpectedly, loss of a functional Ncor1-Hdac3 complex in vivo did not
lead to sustained increases in known catabolic genes, but instead
significantly altered the oscillatory patterns of several metabolic
genes, demonstrating that circadian regulation of metabolism is critical
for normal energy balance. Alenghat et al. (2008) concluded that
activation of Hdac3 by Ncor1 is a nodal point in the epigenetic
regulation of circadian and metabolic physiology.

Brenner (2002) stated that HINT2 encodes a deduced 163-amino acid
protein that contains 35 additional N-terminal amino acids compared with
HINT1 (601314).

MAPPING

Brenner (2002) stated that the HINT2 gene maps to chromosome 9p11.2.

ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 46, FORMERLY; ZNF46, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chardin et al. (1991) isolated a human cDNA encoding a protein with 2
zinc fingers in its C-terminal part, which they named KUP for
Kruppel-related protein. Genomic sequences hybridizing with the human
KUP probe were found in rat and mouse. The highest levels of expression
of the gene were found in testis, fetal liver, and hematopoietic cells.
The KUP protein is 433 amino acids long, has a molecular weight of about
50 kD, and binds to DNA. Its structure, resembling that of the Kruppel
family, suggests that it is also a transcription factor.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a systems analysis of transcriptional regulators within T cells
during different phases of development and differentiation, Benita et
al. (2010) identified ZBTB25, a BTB-POZ family transcription factor, as
a highly T cell-enriched transcription factor. They provided evidence
that ZBTB25 negatively regulates NFAT (see 600489) activation, including
RNA interference studies showing ZBTB25 knockdown resulted in enhanced
activation of NFAT target genes after T-cell receptor engagement. Benita
et al. (2010) concluded that ZBTB25 has a role in NFAT-mediated gene
expression.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Chardin et al. (1991) assigned the ZNF46 gene
to chromosome 14q23-q24.

608753	TITLE *608753 tRNA SPLICING ENDONUCLEASE 2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; TSEN2
;;SEN2, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; SEN2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

tRNA splicing is a fundamental process required for cell growth and
division. SEN2 is a subunit of the tRNA splicing endonuclease, which
catalyzes the removal of introns, the first step in tRNA splicing
(Paushkin et al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching sequence databases using yeast Sen2 as probe, followed by
PCR of human cDNA libraries, Paushkin et al. (2004) isolated a
full-length SEN2 cDNA and a splice variant lacking exon 8. Full-length
SEN2 contains 465 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 51
kD. It shares a high degree of similarity with yeast Sen2 only in the
active site domain. The SEN2 variant lacking exon 8 contains 448 amino
acids. Northern blot analysis detected low expression of both SEN2
transcripts in all tissues examined. Immunofluorescence microscopy of
transfected HeLa cells localized both SEN2 isoforms to the nucleus. The
variant lacking exon 8 was frequently found in nucleoli in dot-like
structures.

GENE FUNCTION

Paushkin et al. (2004) identified and characterized the human tRNA
splicing endonuclease. This enzyme consists of SEN2, SEN34 (608754),
SEN15 (608756), and SEN54 (608755), homologs of the yeast tRNA
endonuclease subunits. Additionally, the SEN2 variant lacking exon 8 is
part of a complex with unique RNA endonuclease activity. Paushkin et al.
(2004) found that both human endonuclease complexes are associated with
pre-mRNA 3-prime end processing factors, including CLP1 (608757). Small
interfering RNA-mediated depletion of SEN2 led to defects in maturation
of both pre-tRNA and pre-mRNA. These findings demonstrated a link
between pre-tRNA splicing and pre-mRNA 3-prime end formation, suggesting
that the endonuclease subunits function in multiple RNA processing
events.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TSEN2
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP RH103927).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Budde et al. (2008) identified a homozygous missense mutation in a
patient of consanguineous Pakistani descent, resulting in
pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2 (277470).

In a Pakistani male, the product of a consanguineous union, with
pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2 (PCH2B; 612389) in whom no mutations
in TSEN54 (608755) were identified, Budde et al. (2008) identified a
homozygous A-to-G transition at nucleotide 926 of the TSEN2 gene,
resulting in a tyrosine-to-cysteine substitution at codon 309 (Y309C).
Each parent was heterozygous for the mutation, which was not identified
in 188 healthy Pakistani controls nor in 92 Dutch, 45 Chinese, or 28
Palestinian controls. The tyrosine at position 309 is strictly conserved
(tyrosine or phenylalanine) within eukaryotic organisms.

606758	TITLE *606758 DUAL OXIDASE 1; DUOX1
;;THYROID OXIDASE 1; THOX1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The synthesis of thyroid hormone is catalyzed by a protein complex
located at the apical membrane of thyroid follicular cells. Contained
within this complex is an iodide transporter (605646), thyroperoxidase
(TPO; 274500), and a peroxide generating system that includes DUOX1 and
DUOX2 (606759) (De Deken et al., 2000).

CLONING

Using a probe for a leukocyte NADPH oxidase, De Deken et al. (2000)
cloned a full-length DUOX1 cDNA from a primary human thyroid cell cDNA
library. The deduced 1,551-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 177 kD. It contains several domains characteristic of
flavoproteins including NADPH- and FAD-binding domains, and 4 specific
histidines and a conserved arginine predicted to bind a heme prosthetic
group. DUOX2 also contains 2 EF-hand motifs, 4 putative N-glycosylation
sites, and 7 hydrophobic stretches. It shares 83% and 53% sequence
similarity with DUOX2 and gp91-phox (300481), respectively, and
significant similarity to other NADPH oxidases. DUOX1 and DUOX2 share
53% and 61% sequence similarity, respectively, with a predicted protein
in C. elegans. Northern blot analysis detected expression of a 5.7-kb
DUOX1 transcript in cultured human thymocytes. Immunolocalization
studies demonstrated that DUOX1 colocalizes with thyroperoxidase at the
supranuclear apical pole of all thyroid cells.

GENE FUNCTION

De Deken et al. (2000) detected upregulated expression of DUOX1 and
DUOX2 mRNA in cultured human thymocytes stimulated with cAMP agonists.
In a study of thyroid carcinomas, Lacroix et al. (2001) showed that
levels of DUOX1 and DUOX2 were maintained in parallel and were more
frequently seen in neoplastic tissues expressing other thyroid
differentiation markers.

Caillou et al. (2001) investigated the gene and protein expression of
DUOX1 and DUOX2 in normal and pathologic human thyroid tissues using
real-time kinetic quantitative PCR and antipeptide antibodies,
respectively. In normal tissue, DUOX1 and DUOX2 localized at the apical
pole of thyrocytes. Immunostaining for DUOX1 and DUOX2 was
heterogeneous, inside a given follicle, with 40 to 60% of positive
follicular cells. Among normal and pathologic tissues, variations of
DUOX1 and DUOX2 mRNA levels were parallel, suggesting a similar
regulation of both gene expressions. The authors concluded that DUOX
proteins are apical glycoproteins with a regulation of expression that
differs from that of other thyroid markers. Because DUOX1 and DUOX2 are
not absolutely thyroid-specific, and because they constitute a novel
family of long homologs of the NOX flavoproteins and were predicted to
form a part of NADPH:O(2)-oxidoreductase systems, Caillou et al. (2001)
referred to the DUOX proteins as LNOX (for 'long NOX') 1 and 2.

Niethammer et al. (2009) probed the role of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
during the early events of wound responses in zebrafish larvae
expressing the genetically encoded H2O2 sensor. This reporter revealed a
sustained rise in H2O2 concentration at the wound margin, starting
approximately 3 minutes after wounding and peaking at approximately 20
minutes, which extended 100 to 200 microns into the tail fin epithelium
as a decreasing concentration gradient. Using pharmacologic and genetic
inhibition, they showed that this gradient is created by dual oxidase
(Duox1 and Duox2, 606759) and that it is required for rapid requirement
of leukocytes to the wound. Niethammer et al. (2009) concluded that this
was the first observation of a tissue-scale H2O2 pattern, and the first
evidence that H2O2 signals to leukocytes in tissues, in addition to its
known antiseptic role.

EVOLUTION

Grasberger and Refetoff (2006) found that the DUOX/DUOXA arrangement is
highly conserved. The bidirectional association of Duox and Duoxa
emerged before the divergence of echinoderms. Teleosts have single
copies of the Duox and Duoxa genes, and these underwent tandem
duplication to an inverted repeat (Duox2/Duoxa2 (612772)/Duoxa1
(612771)/Duox1) in vertebrates before the amphibian divergence.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, De Deken et al. (2000) mapped the DUOX1
and DUOX2 genes on chromosome 15q15.3.

;;T2R9;;
TASTE RECEPTOR, FAMILY B, MEMBER 6; TRB6
DESCRIPTION See TRB2 (604791). Matsunami et al. (2000) used in silico methods to
identify a family of candidate taste receptors that are members of the G
protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily and that are specifically
expressed in taste receptor cells. Using the TRB2 sequence to search the
human chromosome 12 database, Matsunami et al. (2000) identified 8
related genes, all in the same contig. Six encode receptors related to
TRB2, and 2 are pseudogenes. All TRB genes have the 7 transmembrane
domain structure characteristic of GPCRs, but lack a long extracellular
N-terminal domain proposed to bind ligand, suggesting that they use a
different mode of ligand binding. Matsunami et al. (2000) concluded that
the TRBs are diverse in protein sequence, which is consistent with an
ability to detect a variety of tastants with very different chemical
structures.

Adler et al. (2000) identified members of a family of 40 to 80 human and
rodent GPCRs expressed in subsets of taste receptor cells of the tongue
and palate epithelia. These candidate taste receptors, which the authors
called T2Rs, are organized in the genome in clusters and are genetically
linked to loci that influence bitter perception in mice and humans. Each
T2R gene encodes a 7-transmembrane receptor protein. The amino acid
sequence identities between human and mouse T2Rs range from 46 to 67%.
The authors determined that a single taste receptor cell expresses a
large repertoire of T2Rs, suggesting that each cell may be capable of
recognizing multiple tastants. In situ hybridization demonstrated that
T2Rs are exclusively expressed in taste receptor cells that contain the
G protein subunit gustducin, implying that they function as
gustducin-linked receptors. Adler et al. (2000) identified T2R9, which
is identical to the TRB6 gene reported by Matsunami et al. (2000), in a
BAC clone from 12p13.

Kinnamon (2000) reviewed the role of taste receptors in taste
transduction.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The study of patients with partial trisomy 21 has defined an area of
approximately 3 Mb at chromosomal region 21q22 as the minimal candidate
region for the Down syndrome phenotype (190685). Using a novel exon
cloning strategy, Fuentes et al. (1995) identified several putative
exons from region 21q22.1-q22.2. One exon was used to isolate fetal
brain cDNAs corresponding to the RCAN1 gene, which the authors
designated DSCR1. The predicted 171-amino acid protein contains 2
proline-rich regions, a putative DNA-binding domain, and an acidic
region. Northern blot analysis revealed that the 2.2-kb DSCR1 transcript
is expressed at the highest levels in fetal brain and adult heart and at
lower levels in various other tissues. An additional 2-kb mRNA was
detected in fetal and adult liver. Increased expression in the brains of
young rats compared with adults suggested to Fuentes et al. (1995) that
DSCR1 plays a role during central nervous system development.

By screening a human liver cDNA library and by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE
of whole human fetus, fetal brain, adult cerebellum, and adult brain,
Fuentes et al. (1997) identified splice variants of DSCR1 containing 4
alternative first exons. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of
transcripts containing exon 1 or exon 4 in a wide range of tissues, and
both transcripts were about 2.2 kb. Transcripts containing exon 1 were
expressed at highest levels in fetal brain and adult heart, brain, and
skeletal muscle. Transcripts containing exon 4 were expressed at highest
levels in fetal kidney and adult heart, skeletal muscle, and placenta.
RT-PCR detected transcripts containing exon 2 in fetal brain and liver,
but no transcripts containing exon 3 were observed.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fuentes et al. (1997) determined that RCAN1 spans nearly 45 kb and
contains 7 exons, including 4 alternative first exons. They identified
potential promoter regions upstream of exons 1, 2, and 4. The promoter
regions associated with exons 1 and 2 contain CpG islands with numerous
SP1 (189906)-binding sites, but no CAAT or TATA box elements. The
promoter region associated with exon 4 contains a possible TATA box, but
no SP1-binding sites.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids and YACs, Fuentes et al. (1995)
confirmed that the RCAN1 gene is located at chromosome 21q22.1-q22.2.
Strippoli et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Rcan1 gene to chromosome 16.

GENE FUNCTION

Fuentes et al. (2000) demonstrated that DSCR1 protein is overexpressed
in the brain of Down syndrome fetuses, and interacts physically and
functionally with calcineurin A (114105), the catalytic subunit of the
Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase PP2B. The DSCR1-binding
region in calcineurin A is located in the linker region between the
calcineurin A catalytic domain and the calcineurin B-binding domain,
outside of other functional domains previously defined in calcineurin A.
DSCR1 belongs to a family of evolutionarily conserved proteins with 3
members in humans: DSCR1, RCAN2 (604876), and RCAN3 (605860).
Overexpression of DSCR1 and RCAN2 inhibited calcineurin-dependent gene
transcription through the inhibition of NFAT (see 600489) translocation
to the nucleus. The authors hypothesized that members of this family of
human proteins are endogenous regulators of calcineurin-mediated
signaling pathways and may be involved in many physiologic processes.

In mice and humans, MCIP1 (RCAN1) is expressed primarily in cardiac and
skeletal muscles (Rothermel et al., 2000), and transcription of the
MCIP1 gene, but not of the MCIP2 (RCAN2) gene, is potently stimulated by
activated calcineurin, thereby establishing a negative feedback
mechanism that presumably serves to protect cells from otherwise
deleterious consequences of unrestrained calcineurin activity (Yang et
al., 2000). Yang et al. (2000) identified an alternative
calcineurin-responsive promoter 5-prime of exon 4 in the MCIP1 gene.

Kingsbury and Cunningham (2000) referred to the proteins encoded by the
MCIP genes as calcipressins. Functional analysis showed that when
expressed in yeast, DSCR1 and RCAN2 inhibited calcineurin function. The
authors proposed that increased expression of DSCR1 in trisomy-21
individuals may contribute to the neurologic, cardiac, or immunologic
defects of Down syndrome.

Ermak et al. (2001) showed significant expression of DSCR1 in brain,
spinal cord, kidney, liver, mammary gland, skeletal muscle, and heart.
Within the brain, DSCR1 was predominantly expressed in neurons of the
cerebral cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra, thalamus, and medulla
oblongata without regard to age in humans or rats. Postmortem studies of
8 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300) and 8 controls showed
that DSCR1 expression in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of AD
patients was approximately double that of controls, and moreover, that
DSCR1 levels in brains with extensive neurofibrillary tangles were 3
times higher than in controls. Previous studies had shown that decreased
calcineurin phosphatase activity allowed accumulation of
hyperphosphorylated tau protein and cytoskeletal changes in the brain
similar to those observed in AD (Kayyali et al., 1997). Since DSCR1
inhibits calcineurin activity, Ermak et al. (2001) suggested that
increased DSCR1 levels may cause accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau
protein and production of neurofibrillary tangles, thereby promoting the
development of AD. Cell studies showed that toxic levels of aggregated
amyloid beta 1-42 peptide directly stimulated DSCR1 expression, perhaps
as a protective mechanism against calcineurin-induced apoptosis. The
authors suggested that while DSCR1 overexpression may initially be
protective, chronic overexpression may eventually lead to the formation
of neurofibrillary tangles associated with AD.

Yao and Duh (2004) demonstrated that DSCR1 was induced in human
endothelial cells in response to VEGF (192240), TNFA (191160), and
calcium mobilization, and this upregulation was inhibited by inhibitors
of the calcineurin (see 114105)-NFAT (see 600490) signaling pathway, as
well as by PKC (see 176960) inhibition and a calcium chelator. Yao and
Duh (2004) hypothesized that upregulation of DSCR1 in endothelial cells
may act as an endogenous feedback inhibitor of angiogenesis by
regulating the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway.

Using DNA microarray analysis, Minami et al. (2004) found that treatment
of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with VEGF or thrombin
(F2; 176930) upregulated expression of DSCR1 variant-4, which contains
exons 4 through 7. DSCR1 expression was induced by VEGF and thrombin via
KDR (191306) and PAR1 (F2R; 187930), respectively, and involved
cooperative binding of NFATC and GATA2 (137295)/GATA3 (131320) to
neighboring consensus motifs in the DSCR1 internal promoter between
exons 3 and 4. Cyclosporine A, a calcineurin inhibitor, inhibited both
VEGF- and thrombin-induced DSCR1 induction. In HUVECs, VEGF induced
formation of capillary or tube-like structures, and DSCR1 overexpression
reduced tube formation. DSCR1 treatment also reduced blood vessel
density and tumor size in mice injected subcutaneously with B16 melanoma
cells. Minami et al. (2004) concluded that VEGF- and thrombin-mediated
induction of endothelial cell proliferation triggers a negative feedback
loop of DSCR1 induction leading to reduced NFAT signaling.

Arron et al. (2006) reported that 2 genes, DSCR1 and DYRK1A (600855),
that lie within the Down syndrome critical region of human chromosome 21
act synergistically to prevent nuclear occupancy of NFATc transcription
factors (see 600489), which are regulators of vertebrate development.
Arron et al. (2006) used mathematical modeling to predict that
autoregulation within the pathway accentuates the effects of trisomy of
DSCR1 and DYRK1A, leading to failure to activate NFATc target genes
under specific conditions. The authors' observations of calcineurin- and
Nfatc-deficient mice, Dscr1- and Dyrk1a-overexpressing mice, mouse
models of Down syndrome, and human trisomy 21 are consistent with these
predictions. Arron et al. (2006) suggested that the 1.5-fold increase in
dosage of DSCR1 and DYRK1A cooperatively destabilizes a regulatory
circuit, leading to reduced NFATc activity and many of the features of
Down syndrome. Arron et al. (2006) concluded that more generally, their
observations suggest that the destabilization of regulatory circuits can
underlie human disease.

To investigate the role of DSCR1 overexpression in Down syndrome and
development, Kluetzman et al. (2005) injected mouse embryos with
full-length human DSCR1, including extensive upstream and downstream
sequence. They found that DSCR1 overexpression was embryonic lethal and
proposed that other genes overrepresented in trisomy 21 may suppress the
lethality of DSCR1 overexpression.

Kim et al. (2006) stated that DSCR1 inhibits the induction of genes
involved in the inflammatory response. They found that overexpression of
the DSCR1 variant-4 attenuated phorbol ester-induced COX2 (PTGS2;
600262) upregulation in a human glioblastoma cell line. This response
was independent of calcineurin and involved stabilization
I-kappa-B-alpha (NFKBIA; 164008), an inhibitor of the transcription
factor NF-kappa-B (see 164011). Both full-length DSCR1 variant-4 and an
N-terminally truncated variant-4 decreased the steady-state activity of
NF-kappa-B as well as phorbol ester-induced activation of NF-kappa-B.

Using mouse cortical neurons, Porta et al. (2007) showed that Rcan1
increased neuronal susceptibility to oxidative stress.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human fetal brain library, Lee et al.
(2008) showed that DSCR1 interacted with NF-kappa-B-inducing kinase
(NIK, or MAP3K14; 604655). NIK phosphorylated the C-terminal region of
Dscr1 in a rat hippocampal cell line and in primary cortical neurons.
NIK-mediated phosphorylation of Dscr1 increased its protein stability
and blocked its proteasomal degradation, which led to increased levels
of soluble and insoluble Dscr1. Insoluble Dscr1 formed cytosolic
aggregates. Whereas formation of Dscr1 aggregates was not neurotoxic,
overexpression of Dscr1 without formation of aggregates led to
apoptosis.

Using microarray and RT-PCR analyses, Belmont et al. (2008) showed that
Rcan1 variant-4 was induced in mouse heart by activation of the Atf6
gene (605537), a transcription factor involved in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress response that fosters cell survival. Rcan1 was
also induced in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes following ER stress.
Overexpression of activated Atf6 in cultured cardiomyocytes induced the
Rcan1 promoter, upregulated Rcan1 mRNA, inhibited calcineurin
phosphatase activity, and inhibited cell growth. These effects were
inhibited by Rcan1-targeted small interfering RNA.

Baek et al. (2009) demonstrated that DSCR1 expression is increased in
tissue samples from Down syndrome (190685) patients and in a mouse model
of Down syndrome. Furthermore, the modest increase in expression
afforded by a single extra transgenic copy of Dscr1 in mice is
sufficient to confer significant suppression of tumor growth, and such
resistance is a consequence of a deficit in tumor angiogenesis arising
from suppression of the calcineurin pathway. Baek et al. (2009) also
provided evidence that attenuation of calcineurin activity by DSCR1,
together with another chromosome 21 gene Dyrk1a, may be sufficient to
markedly diminish angiogenesis. Baek et al. (2009) concluded that their
data provided a mechanism for the reduced cancer incidence of Down
syndrome and identified the calcineurin signaling pathway, and its
regulators DSCR1 and DYRK1A, as potential therapeutic targets in cancer
arising in all individuals.

Using an integrative genomics approach, Lee et al. (2010) identified
DSCR1 (RCAN1) as an NFAT-dependent injury-response gene in mouse smooth
muscle cells (SMC). Induction of DSCR1 inhibited calcineurin/NFAT
signaling through a negative feedback mechanism. DSCR1 overexpression
attenuated NFAT transcriptional activity and COX2 protein expression,
whereas knockdown of endogenous DSCR1 enhanced NFAT transcriptional
activity. Lee et al. (2010) concluded that DSCR1 is a novel
NFAT-dependent, injury-inducible, early gene that may serve to
negatively regulate SMC phenotypic switching.

CYTOGENETICS

Eggermann et al. (2010) reported a patient with a paternally inherited
0.46-Mb duplication of chromosome 21q22, including the KCNE1 (176261)
and RCAN1 genes, who did not have typical facial or cardiac features of
Down syndrome. The patient had a clinical phenotype resembling
Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS; 180860), which is characterized by poor
growth, but typical epigenetic changes associated with SRS were
excluded. The duplication was inherited from his unaffected father.
Eggermann et al. (2010) concluded that the RCAN1 gene is not sufficient
for generating the phenotypic features associated with Down syndrome.

ANIMAL MODEL

To investigate the involvement of MCIP1 in cardiac hypertrophy in vivo,
Vega et al. (2003) generated Mcip1-null mice and subjected them to a
variety of stress stimuli that induced cardiac hypertrophy. In the
absence of stress, Mcip1 -/- animals exhibited no overt phenotype.
However, the lack of Mcip1 exacerbated the hypertrophic response to
activated calcineurin expressed from a muscle-specific transgene,
consistent with the role of MCIP1 as the negative regulator of
calcineurin signaling. Paradoxically, however, cardiac hypertrophy in
response to pressure overload or chronic adrenergic stimulation was
blunted in Mcip1 -/- mice. These findings suggested that MCIP1 can
facilitate or suppress cardiac calcineurin signaling depending on the
nature of the hypertrophic stimulus. These opposing roles of MICP1 have
important implications for therapeutic strategies to regulate cardiac
hypertrophy through modulation of calcineurin-MCIP1 activity.

Ryeom et al. (2003) showed that Csp1-deficient mice had altered
transactivation thresholds for a number of genes triggered in an immune
response. The transactivation thresholds were shifted due to enhanced
calcineurin activity, which drove Fasl (TNFSF6; 134638) expression and
led to premature death of Th1 cells, resulting in defective Th1
responses. Ryeom et al. (2003) concluded that CSP1 acts to ensure that
high-threshold genes, such as FASL, remain silent during the primary
stimulation associated with the clonal expansion of T cells.

186591	TITLE *186591 SYNTAXIN 4; STX4
;;STX4A;;
SYNTAXIN, PLACENTAL;;
p35-2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Li et al. (1994) described the nucleotide sequence of STX4A, a syntaxin
gene isolated from a placenta library. (The gene was previously
symbolized STX2.) It encodes a predicted 297-amino acid protein that is
89% identical to the amino acid sequence of rat Stx4a.

By immunohistochemical analysis of rat brain sections, Kennedy et al.
(2010) showed that Stx4 was expressed throughout brain. In rat
hippocampal neurons, Stx4 showed a punctate distribution in the
somatodendritic compartment, and Stx4 clusters often localized to
dendritic spines. Immunogold electron microscopy of CA1 rat hippocampus
revealed frequent Stx4 labeling near spine membranes at sites lateral to
postsynaptic densities, with occasional labeling of presynaptic
membranes. Biochemical fractionation of mouse brain revealed Stx4 in
synaptosome fractions, but not in synaptic vesicle fractions.

GENE FUNCTION

Mandon et al. (1996) stated that vesicle-associated membrane proteins
(VAMPs) or synaptobrevins (see 185880) are proposed to bind to cognate
vesicle-targeting receptors in target membranes, which include several
members of the syntaxin family. The molecular mechanisms responsible for
targeting of vesicles containing aquaporin-2 (AQP2; 107777) to the
apical plasma membrane of renal collecting duct cells may involve the
vesicle-targeting protein STX4. Among the known syntaxin isoforms, only
STX1 (STX1A; 186590) and STX4 bind VAMP2 (185881) with high affinity.
Thus, STX1 and STX4 could be considered candidates for a role in
targeting of the AQP2/VAMP2-containing vesicles to the apical plasma
membrane in collecting duct cells. In contrast to STX1, which is
expressed predominantly in the central nervous system, STX4 is expressed
in a variety of tissues including the kidney. Mandon et al. (1996) used
sequence data for rat Stx1a, Stx1b (601485), and Stx4 from Bennett et
al. (1993) to design PCR primers for RT-PCR analysis of rat tissues.
They detected Stx4 mRNA in the apical plasma membrane of collecting duct
principal cells. They also demonstrated in the rat kidney the presence
of a protein with the characteristics of Stx4 in the apical plasma
membrane of inner medullary-collecting duct cells.

To clarify the physiologic function of STXBP3 (608339) in
insulin-stimulated GLUT4 (SLC2A4; 138190) exocytosis, Kanda et al.
(2005) generated mouse embryos deficient in the Stx4-binding protein
Stxbp3 and developed Stxbp3 -/- adipocytes from their mesenchymal
fibroblasts. The insulin-induced appearance of Glut4 at the cell surface
was enhanced in Stxbp3 -/- adipocytes compared to +/+ cells. Wortmannin,
an inhibitor of PI3K, inhibited insulin-stimulated Glut4 externalization
in +/+ but not -/- adipocytes. Kanda et al. (2005) suggested that
disruption of the interaction between STX4 and STXBP3 in adipocytes
might result in enhancement of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 externalization.

Using RT-PCR, immunoblot analysis, and immunofluorescence microscopy,
Sander et al. (2008) demonstrated that human intestinal mast cells (MCs)
expressed SNAP23 (602534), STX1B, STX2 (132350), STX3 (STX3A; 600876),
STX4, and STX6 (603944), but not SNAP25 (600322). MCs also expressed
VAMP3 (603657), VAMP7 (300053), and VAMP8 (603177), but, in contrast
with rodent MCs, they expressed only low levels of VAMP2 (185881). VAMP7
and VAMP8 translocated to the plasma membrane and interacted with SNAP23
and STX4 upon activation. Inhibition of STX4, SNAP23, VAMP7, or VAMP8,
but not VAMP2 or VAMP3, resulted in markedly reduced high-affinity IgE
receptor-mediated histamine release. Sander et al. (2008) concluded that
human MCs express a specific pattern of SNAREs and that VAMP7 and VAMP8,
but not VAMP2, are required for rapid degranulation.

Using rat hippocampal neurons, Kennedy et al. (2010) showed that
exocytosis of recycling endosomes at dendritic spines occurred at
Stx4-enriched sites immediately lateral to postsynaptic densities.
Disruption of Stx4 either acutely or chronically blocked membrane fusion
and cargo delivery triggered by synaptic activation, and acute
inhibition of Stx4 abolished long-term potentiation. Kennedy et al.
(2010) concluded that STX4 is a central component of the SNARE machinery
that mediates rapid, activity-dependent fusion of recycling endosomes in
dendritic spines.

602137	TITLE *602137 NADH-UBIQUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE 1 ALPHA SUBCOMPLEX, 2; NDUFA2
;;B8 PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The NDUFA2 gene encodes one of the accessory subunits of complex I, the
first and largest complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Hoefs
et al., 2008).

For a discussion of complex I, see 516000.

CLONING

Dunbar et al. (1997) reported the genomic cloning and fluorescence in
situ hybridization mapping of 5 nuclear-encoded human complex I genes.

Ton et al. (1997) isolated human heart cDNAs encoding the CI-B8, CI-SGDH
(603841), CI-B14 (602138), CI-B12 (603839), and CI-KFYI (603844)
subunits of the HP fraction. Human and bovine B8 protein shared 94%
sequence identity.

Loeffen et al. (1998) noted that complex I can be fragmented into 3
different fractions. The flavoprotein fraction contains the NDUFV1
(161015), NDUFV2 (600532), and NDUFV3 (602184) subunits and the
iron-sulfur protein (IP) fraction contains at least 7 subunits,
NDUFS1-NDUFS6 (see, e.g., 157655) and NDUFA5 (601677). The remaining
subunits, including NDUFA2, are part of the hydrophobic protein (HP)
fraction, which is involved in proton translocation. Loeffen et al.
(1998) reported cDNA sequences of 8 nuclear-encoded subunits located
within the hydrophobic protein fraction of NADH:ubiquinone
oxidoreductase.

MAPPING

Dunbar et al. (1997) mapped NDUFA2 to chromosome 5q31. Emahazion and
Brookes (1998) showed that of the 5 complex I genes mapped by Dunbar et
al. (1997), only the mapping of NDUFA2 was correct. (See NDUFA6
(602138), NDUFA7 (602139), NDUFB8 (602140), and NDUFS8 (602141).)

By intron-based radiation hybrid mapping, Emahazion and Brookes (1998)
mapped the NDUFA2 gene to chromosome 5q31.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a boy with Leigh syndrome (256000) due to mitochondrial complex I
deficiency (252010), Hoefs et al. (2008) identified a homozygous splice
site mutation in the NDUFA2 gene (602137.0001).

NOMENCLATURE

Mammalian complex I has been studied extensively in Bos taurus. The
names of some the bovine complex I subunits designate the single-letter
code for the 4 N-terminal amino acids (e.g., SGDH). The names of
subunits B8-B22 designate their molecular weights (Walker et al., 1992).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NDUFA2, IVS2DS, G-A, +5

In a Turkish boy with Leigh syndrome (256000) due to mitochondrial
complex I deficiency (252010), born of first-cousin parents, Hoefs et
al. (2008) identified a homozygous G-to-A transition in intron 2 of the
NDUFA2 gene, resulting in the skipping of exon 2 and generation of a
prematurely truncated protein, which was confirmed by PCR analysis. He
had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and developmental delay from birth, and
brain MRI showed cerebral atrophy and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum.
After a varicella infection, he developed severe acidosis, seizures, and
coma, and died of cardiovascular arrest at age 11 months. MRI just
before death showed demyelinization of corticospinal tracts and subacute
necrotizing encephalomyelopathy consistent with Leigh syndrome. The
fibroblast and muscle complex I enzymatic activities were 36% and 20% of
control values, respectively. Further studies showed that the NDUFA2
mutation resulted in disturbed assembly and stability of complex I and
decreased complex I activity. In patient fibroblasts, the defect could
be corrected with a baculoviral vector.

605690	TITLE *605690 GLIOMA TUMOR SUPPRESSOR CANDIDATE REGION GENE 1; GLTSCR1
DESCRIPTION Smith et al. (2000) generated a complete transcript map of a 150-kb
interval of chromosome 19q13.3 in which allelic loss is a frequent event
in human diffuse gliomas. Using cDNA selection with whole brain and
placenta poly(A+) RNAs, exon trapping, and genomic sequencing, they
identified 2 novel transcripts, designated GLTSCR1 and GLTSCR2 (605691).
The full-length coding region of GLTSCR1 was defined by skeletal muscle
cDNA library screening and RT-PCR confirmation of exons predicted from
genomic sequence. Northern blot analysis detected expression of a 6.5-kb
GLTSCR1 transcript at moderate levels in heart, brain, placenta,
skeletal muscle, and pancreas, and at lower levels in lung, liver, and
kidney. Mutation analysis of the transcripts in this region in diffuse
gliomas with 19q deletions revealed no tumor-specific mutations.

;;CYTOCHROME c OXIDASE, SUBUNIT VIIa, MUSCLE ISOFORM; COX7AM
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cytochrome c oxidase (COX; EC 1.9.3.1), the last component of the
mitochondrial respiratory chain, catalyzes the transfer of electrons
from reduced cytochrome c to molecular oxygen. In mammals, the
apoprotein is composed of 3 large catalytic subunits, encoded by the
mitochondrial genome (516030, 516040, and 516050), and by 10 smaller,
nuclear-encoded subunits which may play a regulatory role. Subunit VIIa
of mammalian COX exists in at least 2 isoforms, liver (see 123996) and
muscle.

CLONING

Arnaudo et al. (1992) isolated a full-length cDNA encoding the COX7A
muscle isoform. The deduced polypeptide shares 78% identity with the
bovine muscle form but only 63% identity with the human liver isoform.
Northern blot analysis of primate tissues demonstrated that mRNA for the
muscle form is present only in muscle tissues; in contrast, liver mRNA
is present in both muscle and nonmuscle tissues.

Fabrizi et al. (1989) reported the sequence of the human COX7A1 gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wolz et al. (1997) described the genomic sequence and organization of
the human COX7A1 gene and compared it with its bovine homolog. The
coding region of the gene extends over 1.45 kb of genomic sequence and
is organized into 4 exons. Intron-exon boundaries are well conserved
between cattle and humans. Although COX7A1 is a gene for a
tissue-specific isoform, it has some features of a housekeeping gene: it
is located in a CpG island, like its bovine homolog, and no TATA or
CCAAT boxes are found in the 5-prime flanking sequence.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of human/rodent cell hybrid genomic DNA,
Arnaudo et al. (1992) determined that the COX7A muscle form is encoded
by a single locus, designated COX7A1, on chromosome 19.

602133	TITLE *602133 PHOSPHORIBOSYLFORMYLGLYCINAMIDINE SYNTHASE; PFAS
;;PHOSPHORIBOSYLFORMYLGLYCINAMIDE AMIDOTRANSFERASE; FGARAT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Five-prime-phosphoribosyl N-formylglycinamide (FGAR) amidotransferase
(EC 6.3.5.3) catalyzes the fourth reaction in the de novo synthesis of
purines, that is, the conversion of FGAR to 5-prime-phosphoribosyl
N-formylglycinamidine (FGAM) (summary by Barnes et al., 1994).

CLONING

Barnes et al. (1994) purified and characterized
phosphoribosylformylglycinamide amidotransferase (FGARAT) the fourth
enzyme in the de novo purine pathway.

GENE FUNCTION

The human GARS-AIRS-GART locus (138440), located on chromosome 21,
encodes 3 of the 10 enzymatic steps necessary for the conversion of
phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate to inosine monophosphate by the de novo
purine pathway. The 3 enzyme activities are encoded in a linear,
nonoverlapping fashion on the GARS-AIRS-GART mRNA, starting at the
5-prime end of the cDNA. These enzymatic activities catalyze the second,
fifth, and third step of the de novo purine pathway, respectively.
FGARAT catalyzes the fourth step in the pathway (summary by Brodsky et
al., 1997).

Brodsky et al. (1997) reported that, unlike the developmentally
regulated expression of the GARS-AIRS-GART locus, expression of the
FGARAT gene appears to be constitutive.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Barnes et al. (1994) mapped the
PFAS gene to chromosome 17p.

238310	TITLE *238310 AMINOMETHYLTRANSFERASE; AMT
;;GLYCINE CLEAVAGE SYSTEM T PROTEIN; GCST
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The enzyme system for cleavage of glycine (glycine cleavage system; EC
2.1.2.10), which is confined to the mitochondria, is composed of 4
protein components: P protein (a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent glycine
decarboxylase; GLDC, 238300), H protein (a lipoic acid-containing
protein; GCSH, 238330), T protein (a tetrahydrofolate-requiring enzyme),
and L protein (a lipoamide dehydrogenase; DLD, 238331).

Mutations in the T, P, and H proteins have been found to cause glycine
encephalopathy (GCE; 605899).

CLONING

The T protein of the glycine cleavage system is also known as
aminomethyltransferase (AMT). Nanao et al. (1994) isolated the AMT gene
from a human placenta cosmid library. They found that the gene is about
6 kb long and contains 9 exons. They identified 2 putative
glucocorticoid-responsive elements and a putative thyroid
hormone-responsive element. By dot-blot analysis, Kure et al. (2001)
detected expression of AMT in all tissues tested except stomach and bone
marrow.

GENE FUNCTION

Sakata et al. (2001) reported the structure and expression of the
glycine cleavage system in rat central nervous system.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Nanao et al. (1994) assigned the
AMT gene to 3p21.2-p21.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with glycine encephalopathy, Nanao et al. (1994) identified
mutations in the AMT gene (238310.0001-238310.0002).

Toone et al. (2000) studied 14 unrelated patients with glycine
encephalopathy and identified mutations in 4 cases. In 2 patients,
mutations were identified in the T protein: 1 patient was homozygous for
an arg320-to-his mutation (R320H; 238310.0006), and the other patient
was heterozygous for a novel glutamine-to-termination substitution at
codon 192 (238310.0007).

Applegarth and Toone (2001) reviewed the laboratory diagnosis of glycine
encephalopathy and confirmed 9 mutations in the T protein and 8
mutations in the P protein. They also reviewed the 7 cases of transient
NKH known at that time.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLY269ASP

Nanao et al. (1994) found that a patient with typical glycine
encephalopathy (605899) was homozygous for a missense mutation in the
AMT gene, a G-to-A transition leading to a gly-to-asp substitution at
amino acid 269 (G269D).

.0002
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLY47ARG

In 2 sisters with atypical glycine encephalopathy (605899), Nanao et al.
(1994) found compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in the T
protein gene: a G-to-A transition leading to a gly-to-arg substitution
at amino acid 47 (G47R) in 1 allele, and a G-to-A transition leading to
an arg-to-his substitution at amino acid 320 (R320H; 238310.0006) in the
other allele. Nanao et al. (1994) pointed out that gly269, which was
mutant in the typically severe case they studied (see 238300.0001), is
conserved in T proteins of various species, even in E. coli, whereas
gly47 and arg320, which were mutant in the atypical and milder cases,
are replaced by ala and leu, respectively, in E. coli. Thus, mutation
occurring in more conservative amino acid residues results in more
deleterious damage to the T protein and a more severe clinical
phenotype.

.0003
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, HIS42ARG

Kure et al. (1998) reported a large Israeli-Arab kindred with glycine
encephalopathy (605899). Enzymatic analysis demonstrated that T-protein
activity was deficient in the liver from 1 affected person in the
family. Mutation detection revealed a missense mutation in exon 2
resulting in an amino acid substitution from histidine to arginine at
position 42 (his42 to arg). Homozygosity for the H42R mutation was seen
in all affected members of the family.

.0004
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, 1-BP DEL, 183C

In a Japanese patient with glycine encephalopathy (605899), Kure et al.
(1998) described a 1-bp deletion (183delC) and a missense mutation,
asp276 to his (238310.0005).

.0005
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, ASP276HIS

In a Japanese patient with glycine encephalopathy (605899) of neonatal
onset, Kure et al. (1998) found a G-to-C substitution at position 955 in
exon 7, resulting in an amino acid change from aspartate to histidine at
position 276.

.0006
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, ARG320HIS

See 238310.0001 and Nanao et al. (1994).

Toone et al. (2001) screened a DNA bank from 50 patients with
enzymatically confirmed NKH and identified the arg320-to-his (R320H)
mutation in 7% of alleles.

.0007
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLN192TER

In a patient with neonatal-onset NKH (605899), Toone et al. (2000)
identified a C-to-T transition resulting in a glutamine-to-termination
codon substitution at residue 192 (Q192X). The other mutation in this
patient was not identified.

.0008
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, IVS7, G-A, -1

Toone et al. (2001) reported a novel splice site mutation at the -1
position of intron 7 of the AMT gene: G was converted to A. This
mutation was found in 3 unrelated families and was not found in any
normal controls.

300826	TITLE *300826 STROMAL ANTIGEN 2; STAG2
;;SA2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Stromal cells from blood-forming organs provide the physical support for
hematopoietic cell organization. The stroma also produces signals for
seeding, renewal, proliferation, and differentiation of stem cells. By
screening a human thymus cDNA library with a mouse SA1 cDNA, Carramolino
et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding STAG2, which they named SA2. The
deduced protein has 1,162 amino acids, and its sequence is 78% similar
to that of STAG1 (604358).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

By immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses, Sumara et al. (2000)
showed that STAG2 is expressed as an approximately 140-kD protein that
assembles with the cohesin proteins, SMC1 (300040), SMC3 (606062), and
SCC1 (RAD21; 606462). The cohesin complex also coprecipitates with PDS5
(see 613200), but in a less stable way than the proteins in the cohesin
assembly. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated nonnucleolar
expression of STAG2 in interphase and early prophase, but expression did
not occur again until telophase, with the onset of chromosome
decondensation. The expression pattern paralleled those of STAG1, PDS5,
and the other cohesin subunits. Cohesin dissociation was found to be
independent of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC; see 603462). Sumara
et al. (2000) proposed that there is a prophase pathway that removes the
bulk of cohesin complexes, thereby enabling chromosome condensation
while releasing cohesion between chromosome arms, and that residual
cohesin is removed by an anaphase pathway.

GENE FUNCTION

Renault et al. (2011) presented evidence suggesting that the STAG2 gene
may play a role in familial skewed X inactivation-2 (SXI2; 300179). In a
Canadian family with hemophilia A (HEMA; 306700) in which 3 affected
females showed skewed X inactivation (Renault et al., 2007), Renault et
al. (2011) found linkage to a 16.7-cM region on Xq25-q27, which contains
the STAG2 gene. Although no pathogenic mutations were found in STAG2,
its function as a core component of the ring-like cohesin complex
involved in sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis made it a candidate
gene for the trait.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Solomon et al. (2011) found that diverse range of tumor types harbor
deletions or inactivating mutations of STAG2, the gene encoding a
subunit of the cohesin complex, which regulates the separation of sister
chromatids during cell division. Because STAG2 is on the X chromosome,
its inactivation requires only a single mutational event. Studying a
near-diploid human cell line with a stable karyotype, Solomon et al.
(2011) found that targeted inactivation of STAG2 led to chromatid
cohesion defects and aneuploidy, whereas in 2 aneuploid human
glioblastoma cell lines, targeted correction of the endogenous mutant
alleles of STAG2 led to enhanced chromosomal stability. Thus, Solomon et
al. (2011) concluded that genetic disruption of cohesin is a cause of
aneuploidy in human cancer.

602026	TITLE *602026 PHYTANOYL-CoA HYDROXYLASE; PHYH
;;PAHX;;
LNAP1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PHYH gene encodes phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase, a peroxisomal protein
that catalyzes the first step in the alpha-oxidation of phytanic acid, a
branched-chain fatty acid. Because beta-oxidation is blocked by the
methyl group at C-3, phytanic acid must first undergo decarboxylation
via an alpha-oxidation mechanism catalyzed by PHYH (Jansen et al.,
1997).

CLONING

The gene encoding the PHYH enzyme was identified by Mihalik et al.
(1997) starting from studies of peroxisomal genes and gene defects in
yeast and independently by Jansen et al. (1997) working back from the
partial amino acid sequence of the purified rat protein. Both groups
made use of expressed sequence tag (EST) database searching for
identification of the full-length human cDNA sequence. The open reading
frame encodes a 41.2-kD protein of 338 amino acids, which contains a
cleavable peroxisomal targeting signal type 2 (PTS2).

GENE STRUCTURE

Jansen et al. (2000) determined that the PHYH gene spans approximately
21 kb and contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

Radiation hybrid data studies by Mihalik et al. (1997) placed the PAHX
gene on chromosome 10 between markers D10S249 and D10S466.

GENE FUNCTION

The structure and subcellular localization of the phytanic acid
alpha-oxidation pathway long remained enigmatic, although it was
generally assumed to involve phytanic acid and not its CoA-ester.
However, this view was challenged by the finding in rat liver that
phytanic acid must first be activated to its CoA ester, phytanoyl-CoA,
before it can be oxidized (Watkins et al., 1994).

Mihalik et al. (1995) identified an enzyme activity (phytanoyl-CoA
hydroxylase) in rat-liver peroxisomes by which phytanoyl-CoA is
converted to 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA. Jansen et al. (1996) showed that
phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase is present in human liver. Furthermore, they
showed that it is located in peroxisomes and is deficient in liver from
Zellweger syndrome (see 214100) patients, who lack morphologically
distinguishable peroxisomes, providing an explanation for the long-known
deficient oxidation of phytanic acid in these patients. They also showed
that phytanic acid alpha-oxidation is peroxisomal and that it utilizes
the CoA derivative as substrate, thus giving support in favor of the
revised pathway of phytanic acid alpha-oxidation.

Mihalik et al. (1997) found that human PAHX is targeted to peroxisomes,
requires the PTS2 receptor PEX7 (601757) for peroxisomal localization,
interacts with the PTS2 receptor in the yeast 2-hybrid assay, and has
intrinsic phytanoyl-CoA alpha-hydroxylase activity that requires the
dioxygenase cofactor iron and cosubstrate 2-oxoglutarate.

Using the yeast 2-hybrid system to investigate the physiologic function
of FKBP52 (600611), Chambraud et al. (1999) found that PAHX is an
FKBP-associated protein. They found, furthermore, that the protein
corresponds to the mouse protein Lnap1, which, based on studies of the
MRL/lpr mouse, may be involved in the progression of lupus nephritis
(Iwano et al., 1996). Chambraud et al. (1999) suggested that PAHX is a
serious candidate for studying the cellular signaling pathway(s)
involving FKBP52 in the presence of immunosuppressant drugs.

McDonough et al. (2005) stated that both the pro and mature forms of
human PAHX are enzymatically active and show similar substrate
specificity.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

McDonough et al. (2005) solved the x-ray crystallographic structure of
human PAHX complexed with Fe(2+) and 2-oxoglutarate to 2.5-angstrom
resolution. PAHX has a double-stranded beta-helix core with 3
iron-binding residues, his175, asp177, and his264. The 2-oxoacid group
of 2-oxoglutarate binds to Fe(2+) in a bidentate manner. Cys191 is
positioned 6.7-angstrom from Fe(2+), and his155 and his281 form part of
the active site. Of the 15 PAHX residues mutated in Refsum disease
(266500) patients, 11 cluster in 2 distinct groups around the binding
sites for Fe(2+) (e.g., gln176; see 602026.0007) and 2-oxoglutarate
(e.g., gly204; see 602026.0008).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mihalik et al. (1997) and Jansen et al. (1997) identified homozygous or
compound heterozygous mutations in the PHYH gene
(602026.0001-602026.0004) in a total of 7 patients with Refsum disease
(266500).

In 22 patients with Refsum disease, Jansen et al. (2000) identified
mutations in the PHYH gene, including 14 different missense mutations, a
3-bp insertion, and a 1-bp deletion, which were all confirmed at the
genome level. A 111-bp deletion identified in the PHYH cDNA of several
patients with Refsum disease was due to either 1 of 2 different
mutations in the same splice acceptor site, which result in skipping of
exon 3. Six mutations were expressed in S. cerevisiae, and all led to an
enzymatically inactive PhyH protein.

Mukherji et al. (2001) relied on crystallographic data for other members
of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase superfamily to generate
secondary structural predictions for the PHYH gene, which were tested by
site-directed mutagenesis. Constructed H175A and D177A mutants did not
catalyze hydroxylation of phytanoyl-CoA, consistent with the assigned
role of these residues as iron(II) binding ligands. The clinically
observed mutations pro29 to ser (P29S; 602026.0006), gln176 to lys
(Q176K; 602026.0007), gly204 to ser (G204S; 602026.0008), asn269 to his
(N269H; 602026.0004), arg275 to gln (R275Q; 602026.0009), and arg275 to
trp (R275W; 602026.0001) were assayed for both 2-oxoglutarate and
phytanoyl-CoA oxidation. The P29S mutant was fully active, implying that
the mutation may result in defective targeting of the protein to
peroxisomes. Mutation of arg275 resulted in impaired 2-oxoglutarate
binding. The Q176K, G204S, and N269H mutations caused partial uncoupling
of 2-oxoglutarate conversion from phytanoyl-CoA oxidation. The authors
cautioned that the diagnosis of Refsum disease should not solely rely
upon PHYH assays for 2-oxoglutarate or phytanoyl-CoA oxidation.

Jansen et al. (2004) reviewed mutations in the PHYH gene causing Refsum
disease.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
REFSUM DISEASE, ADULT, 1
PHYH, ARG275TRP

In a Ukrainian patient with Refsum disease (266500), whose parents
originated from the same region, Mihalik et al. (1997) identified a
homozygous 823C-T transition in the PHYH gene, predicted to result in an
arg275-to-trp (R275W) amino acid substitution. The mutation also
eliminated a unique BspEI restriction site. The arginine-275 residue is
conserved in both the mouse and the C. elegans forms of the protein. In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant enzyme was
inactive.

Jansen et al. (2000) expressed the mutant R275W allele in S. cerevisiae
and determined that no enzymatic activity was present.

.0002
REFSUM DISEASE, ADULT, 1
PHYH, IVS2AS, A-G, -2

In a patient with Refsum disease (266500), Mihalik et al. (1997)
discovered a truncated form of PHYH mRNA lacking 111 nucleotides of the
open reading frame (residues 158-269 of the cDNA sequence), deleting
codons 46-82. (Jansen et al. (1997) stated that this nucleotide
numbering was incorrect; see below.) Sequence analysis of genomic DNA
spanning this region of the gene revealed the absence of a single exon
in the cDNA. An A-to-G transition was found at the penultimate residue
of the upstream intron, altering the consensus splice acceptor sequence
of AG to GG. The patient was homozygous for the mutation.

In 3 unrelated patients with Refsum disease, Jansen et al. (1997)
observed a 111-bp deletion covering residues 135 to 246 of their PHYH
cDNA. The deletion did not cause a frameshift, but resulted in a protein
lacking 37 internal amino acids (Y46-R82del) that was presumed to be
enzymatically inactive. The deletion was thought to be the result of the
missplicing and skipping of 1 or more exons, as analysis of the putative
exon boundaries showed a perfect match with the 5-prime exon boundary
consensus. The deletion was homozygous in 2 patients and present in
compound heterozygous state in the third.

.0003
REFSUM DISEASE, ADULT, 1
PHYH, 1-BP DEL, 164T

In a brother and sister with Refsum disease (266500) born to healthy
first-cousin Pakistani parents, Jansen et al. (1997) identified a
homozygous deletion of nucleotide 164T in the PHYH gene, leading to a
frameshift and a premature stop codon after amino acid 66. The first
manifestation in the sister was nystagmus at the age of 6 months. Night
blindness and retinitis pigmentosa were found at the age of 8 years. At
the age of 10 years, she had ataxia, deafness, ichthyosis, and short
metacarpal bones, as well as peripheral neuropathy but normal
intellectual performance. Plasma phytanic acid level was elevated. The
brother showed elevated plasma phytanic acid when first measured at 7
weeks. He was placed on a low phytanic acid diet with vitamin C
supplement. His development was good and he appeared to see well.
Although the appearance of his retina was normal, visual evoked
responses were delayed and ERG response was poor.

.0004
REFSUM DISEASE, ADULT, 1
PHYH, ASN269HIS

In a Caucasian male with Refsum disease (266500) reported by Skjeldal et
al. (1987), Jansen et al. (1997) identified a heterozygous 805A-C
transition in the PHYH gene, resulting in an asn269-to-his (N269H)
substitution. The patient was a compound heterozygote for this missense
mutation and for a 111-bp deletion (602026.0002), which was observed in
2 other unrelated patients.

.0005
REFSUM DISEASE, ADULT, 1
PHYH, 3-BP INS, 576GCC

In 2 sibs with Refsum disease (266500), Jansen et al. (2000)
demonstrated homozygosity for a 3-bp insertion (576insGCC) in exon 6 of
the PHYH gene, resulting in addition of an alanine residue after amino
acid 192.

.0006
RECLASSIFIED - PHYTANOYL-CoA HYDROXYLASE POLYMORPHISM (dbSNP rs28938169)
PHYH, PRO29SER

This variant, formerly titled REFSUM DISEASE, ADULT, 1, has been
reclassified as a polymorphism. As of December 2012, the pro29-to-ser
(P29S) variant had an overall population frequency of 20% (Exome Variant
Server, 2012). In addition, the patients reported by Jansen et al.
(2000) with this mutation had additional mutations in the PHYH gene that
may have been causative and the P29S mutant was found to be fully
active.

In 2 patients with Refsum disease (266500), Jansen et al. (2000) found
an 85C-T transition in the PHYH gene, leading to a P29S substitution.
The patients also had a truncating mutation (602026.0002) and either
589G-C or 648C-T leading to missense mutations E197Q or H220Y,
respectively.

.0007
REFSUM DISEASE, ADULT, 1
PHYH, GLN176LYS

In the cDNA of a patient with Refsum disease (266500), Jansen et al.
(2000) described a 526C-A transversion in the PHYH gene, leading to a
gln176-to-lys (Q176K) substitution.

.0008
REFSUM DISEASE, ADULT, 1
PHYH, GLY204SER

In the cDNA of a patient with Refsum disease (266500), Jansen et al.
(2000) described a 610G-A transition in the PHYH gene, leading to a
gly204-to-ser (G204S) substitution.

.0009
REFSUM DISEASE, ADULT, 1
PHYH, ARG275GLN

In the cDNA of patients with Refsum disease (266500), Jansen et al.
(2000) described an 824G-A transition in the PHYH gene, leading to an
arg275-to-gln (R275Q) mutation.

611531	TITLE *611531 ESSENTIAL FOR MITOTIC GROWTH 1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; EMG1
;;NUCLEOLAR ESSENTIAL PROTEIN 1; NEP1;;
C2F
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

EMG1 plays a role in the processing of the pre-18S rRNA and small
ribosomal subunit assembly (Liu and Thiele, 2001) and may play a role in
methylation during ribosome biogenesis (Eschrich et al., 2002).

CLONING

By stress-responsive gene expression and functional studies, Liu and
Thiele (2001) identified yeast Emg1, which was transiently repressed
during heat shock and other stress conditions. Database analysis
identified human and mouse EMG1, which encode deduced proteins of 239
and 244 amino acids, respectively. Biochemical fractionation studies
localized Emg1 to both the cytosolic and nuclear fractions. Fluorescence
microscopy localized Emg1 throughout the cell but with a clear nuclear
signal.

Eschrich et al. (2002) characterized C. albicans, S. cerevisiae, and
human EMG1 proteins, which they called NEP1. Fluorescence microscopy
localized human EMG1 to the nucleolus in HeLa cells.

Using RNA blot analysis, Armistead et al. (2009) examined the EMG1
expression in normal adult tissues and detected the strongest signals in
heart, liver, and stomach, followed by kidney and brain. Comparison of
EMG1 expression in human adult and fetal tissues by semiquantitative PCR
analysis showed similar or higher expression in most adult tissues
except for brain, which showed higher fetal than adult expression.

MAPPING

Eschrich et al. (2002) stated that the EMG1 gene mapped to chromosome
12p13.

GENE FUNCTION

Liu and Thiele (2001) showed that yeast Emg1 was required for viability
and that its loss was complemented by expression of mouse Emg1. By
deletion mapping, yeast 2-hybrid analysis, and coimmunoprecipitation,
they showed that yeast Emg1 interacted with the central domain of yeast
Nop14 (611526). Yeast 2-hybrid analysis demonstrated interaction between
mouse Emg1 and human NOP14. Emg1 localized to both nuclear and
cytoplasmic fractions in the presence of Nop14 but to the cytoplasmic
fraction only in Nop14-depleted cells. Conditional Emg1 double-mutant
yeast displayed hypersensitivity to aminoglycoside antibiotics, which
affect protein translation, suggesting that Emg1 may play a role in RNA
processing or ribosome biogenesis. Pulse-chase labeling of ribosomal RNA
transcript processing in conditional Emg1 double-mutant yeast showed a
processing defect characterized by increased levels of 35S precursor and
reduced levels of 18S rRNA and its 20S precursor. Further studies
determined that the processing defect occurred primarily at the level of
20S maturation. Observation of a similar phenotype in Nop14 conditional
mutant yeast suggested that Nop14 and Emg1 act in the same pathway
leading to 18S rRNA maturation but are dispensable for 25S rRNA
processing. Sucrose density gradient profiling of cellular ribosomes and
polysome runoff studies demonstrated that Emg1 and Nop14 conditional
mutants had significantly reduced levels of 40S subunits compared to
60S. Liu and Thiele (2001) concluded that Nop14 and Emg1 act in the same
pathway for 18S rRNA maturation and for 40S ribosome production.

Eschrich et al. (2002) independently demonstrated that human EMG1
complemented yeast Emg1 essential function and that Emg1 was essential
for 40S ribosome subunit biogenesis. They isolated MAT2A as a multicopy
suppressor of the lethal phenotype in temperature-sensitive Emg1
quadruple-mutant yeast. Restoration of Emg1 function by increased
S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (SAMS) suggested that the Emg1 mutant
allele is defective in a SAMS-dependent function and that Emg1 is
involved in methylation during ribosome biogenesis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using DNA samples from 11 Canadian Hutterite families with Bowen-Conradi
syndrome (211180), Armistead et al. (2009) analyzed 35 candidate genes
within a previously mapped 1.9-Mbp interval on chromosome 12p13.3
(Lamont et al., 2005) and identified homozygosity for a missense
mutation in the EMG1 gene (611531.0001) that segregated completely with
disease. The mutation, which destroys an EcoRV site in the most highly
conserved region of the protein, was not found in 414 non-Hutterite
alleles.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BOWEN-CONRADI SYNDROME
EMG1, ASP86GLY

In affected individuals from 11 Canadian Hutterite families with
Bowen-Conradi syndrome (BWCNS; 211180), Armistead et al. (2009)
identified homozygosity for a 400A-G transition in the EMG1 gene,
resulting in an asp86-to-gly (D86G) substitution at a completely
conserved residue, predicted to destroy an EcoRV site. The mutation was
not found in 414 non-Hutterite alleles. Studies in fibroblasts showed a
dramatically reduced level of EMG1 in a BWCNS-affected patient compared
to normal fibroblasts, although patient fibroblasts did not have
complete EMG1 deficiency. Overexpression of D86G-mutant EMG1 in baby
hamster kidney (BHK) cells resulted in decreased level of soluble EMG1,
and yeast 2-hybrid analysis showed that the D86G mutation increased
dimerization of EMG1 subunits, suggesting that aggregation of EMG1 leads
to reduced levels of the protein.

607657	TITLE *607657 CYSTATHIONINE GAMMA-LYASE; CTH
;;CYSTATHIONASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CTH gene encodes cystathionine gamma-lyase (EC 4.4.1.1.), an enzyme
that transforms cystathionine derived from methionine into cysteine.
This reaction is preceded by the condensation of homocysteine and serine
to form cystathionine, a process catalyzed by cystathionine
beta-synthase (CBS; 613381). Cysteine is considered a nonessential amino
acid because it can be synthesized in the body in this way.
Biosynthesized cysteine is further metabolized in the liver to yield
glutathione and taurine (summary by Ishii et al., 2010).

CLONING

Lu et al. (1992) cloned and sequenced a 1,083-bp cDNA encoding human
liver cystathionine gamma-lyase. The human sequence presented a deletion
of 132 bases (44 amino acids) compared to the cystathionase sequence
reported for the rat, and a deletion of 135 bases (45 amino acids)
compared to the sequence reported for yeast. After realignment for the
missing nucleotides, the human cDNA sequence showed significant amino
acid homology to the rat (85%) and yeast (50%) enzymes. Using PCR, Lu et
al. (1992) isolated a second clone which contained the missing 132
bases. Flanking nucleotides in the latter clone were identical to those
in the cDNA clone containing the deletion. Alternative splicing as the
basis of the 2 forms of cystathionase is plausible.

GENE FUNCTION

Yang et al. (2008) demonstrated that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is
physiologically generated by CTH.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wang and Hegele (2003) sequenced the CTH gene in 4 unrelated patients
with cystathioninuria (219500) and identified 2 nonsense and 2 missense
mutations (607657.0001-607657.0004). All affected subjects were either
simple homozygotes or compound heterozygotes. The authors also
identified a common nonsynonymous SNP in exon 12, a 1364G-T transition
in the cDNA sequence, resulting in a ser403-to-ile (S403I) mutation, in
4 ethnic groups.

In 496 Caucasian subjects, Wang et al. (2004) studied the association of
genotypes of the S403I SNP in the CTH gene with plasma total
homocysteine concentrations. T/T homozygotes had significantly higher
mean plasma total homocysteine concentrations than subjects with other
genotypes, and this association had approximately the same effect size
as the association between plasma total homocysteine concentration and
MTHFR (607093) genotype.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CTH
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG39248). The CTH gene had earlier been
assigned to chromosome 16 by study of somatic cell hybrids (Donald et
al., 1982).

ANIMAL MODEL

Yang et al. (2008) demonstrated that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is
physiologically generated by CTH and that genetic deletion of this
enzyme in mice markedly reduced H2S levels in the serum, heart, aorta,
and other tissues. Mutant mice lacking CTH displayed pronounced
hypertension and diminished endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation.
Cystathionine was physiologically activated by calcium and calmodulin
(see 114180), which is a mechanism for H2S formation in response to
vascular activation. Yang et al. (2008) concluded that their findings
provided direct evidence that H2S is a physiologic vasodilator and
regulator of blood pressure.

In contrast to the findings of Yang et al. (2008), Ishii et al. (2010)
found that Cth-null mice mice developed normally and did not show
hypertension. Both male and female mutant mice showed
hypercystathioninemia and hyperhomocysteinemia, but not
hypermethioninemia. Ishii et al. (2010) also found that Cth-null mice
developed acute skeletal muscle atrophy and myopathy resulting in severe
paralysis and death when fed a low cysteine diet. Both Cth-null mice and
hepatocytes derived from these mice showed increased vulnerability to
oxidative injury. Glutathione levels were reduced in liver and skeletal
muscle. The findings indicated that cysteine is an essential amino acid
in Cth-null mice. The phenotype of Cth-null mice differed from that of
Cbs-null mice (613381; Namekata et al., 2004), who showed abnormal lipid
metabolism. Ishii et al. (2010) postulated that the severe myopathic
reaction in Cth-null mice may be present in unknown cases of human CTH
deficiency, and noted that these patients may have hyperhomocysteinemia,
which may be an independent risk factor for disease.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CYSTATHIONINURIA
CTH, 2-BP DEL, 940CT

In an Oriental patient with cystathioninuria (219500), Wang and Hegele
(2003) identified a 2-bp deletion in exon 8 of the CTH cDNA sequence,
940-941delCT, in homozygous state.

.0002
CYSTATHIONINURIA
CTH, 1-BP DEL, 1220C

In a proband of European descent with cystathioninuria (219500), Wang
and Hegele (2003) identified a 1-bp deletion in exon 11 of the CTH cDNA
sequence, 1220delC, which the patient carried in compound heterozygous
state with a thr67-to-ile mutation (T67I; 607657.0003). Each parent was
heterozygous for one or the other of the mutations.

.0003
CYSTATHIONINURIA
CTH, THR67ILE (dbSNP rs28941785)

In a patient of European descent with cystathioninuria (219500), Wang
and Hegele (2003) found homozygosity for a 356C-T transition in exon 2
of the CTH cDNA sequence, resulting in a thr67-to-ile (T67I) mutation.
The same mutation was found in compound heterozygosity with a
gln240-to-glu mutation (Q240E; 607657.0004) in another patient of
European descent.

Espinos et al. (2010) identified a homozygous T67I mutation in 3
unrelated Spanish girls with cystathioninuria. Haplotype analysis of
these 3 patients and of 2 Czech patients with the mutation suggested a
founder effect, and the age of the mutation was estimated at 7,336 years
(262 generations old). The event may have occurred during the spread of
the European population in the Neolithic era. Espinos et al. (2010)
noted that the 200C-T transition, which is the most common change in the
CTH gene and has been observed in the heterozygous state in 1.5% of
controls in the Czech population, has been considered a polymorphism
(dbSNP rs28941785).

.0004
CYSTATHIONINURIA
CTH, GLN240GLU

In a patient of European descent with cystathioninuria (219500), Wang
and Hegele (2003) identified compound heterozygosity for an 874C-G
transversion in exon 7 of the CTH cDNA sequence, resulting in a
gln240-to-glu (Q240E) mutation, and a T67I mutation (607657.0003).

.0005
HOMOCYSTEINE, TOTAL PLASMA, ELEVATED
CTH, 1364G-T, SER403ILE

Wang et al. (2004) found a relationship between the common SNP
polymorphism in exon 12 of CTH and plasma total homocysteine
concentration in a study of 496 Caucasian subjects. CTH 1364T/T
homozygotes had significantly higher concentrations than did subjects
with other genotypes.

HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN M4; HNRNPM4;;
HNRPM4;;
N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINE RECEPTOR 1, FORMERLY; NAGR1, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), which directly bind
to nascent RNA polymerase II transcripts, play an important role in both
transcript-specific packaging and alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs.
Datar et al. (1993) isolated and characterized a group of hnRNPs, the M1
to M4 proteins. The M proteins are pre-mRNA-binding proteins in vivo,
and they bind avidly to poly(G) and poly(U) RNA homopolymers in vitro.
Datar et al. (1993) cloned HNRPM4, which encodes the largest M protein,
M4, with 729 amino acids and a molecular mass of about 77 kD. The M4
protein contains 3 ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence RNA-binding
domains of approximately 90 amino acids each, a glycine- and
methionine-rich region, and an MR (methionine/arginine) repeat motif. It
also contains 9 potential casein kinase type II phosphorylation sites
and a tyrosine phosphorylation site. Two-dimensional gels showed
multiple M4 isoforms, which may be the result of phosphorylation.
Database searches indicated that M4 is most highly related to a
hypothetical 49-kD RNA-binding protein of S. cerevisiae.

Blanck et al. (1994) cloned a cDNA encoding what they believed to be a
monomer for the human GlcNAc thyroid receptor. They assigned the gene,
which they called NAGR1, to 19p13.3-p13.2 by isotopic in situ
hybridization. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.1-kb NAGR1 transcript
in thyroid but not in heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal
muscle, kidney, or pancreas. In an erratum, the authors stated that
their original sequence was in error and that the corrected sequence 'is
almost identical to that of the cDNA encoding the human hnRNP M protein'
cloned by Datar et al. (1993). NAGR1, therefore, could no longer be
considered a putative GlcNAc-specific thyroid receptor.

300365	TITLE *300365 TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR 7; TLR7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Toll-like receptors (TLRs), such as TLR7, are a critical part of the
evolutionarily conserved innate immune system. TLRs have specificity for
different bacterial components, such as lipopolysaccharide (TLR4;
603030), bacterial lipoproteins (TLR2; 603028), and unmethylated CpG
dinucleotides (TLR9; 605474) (summary by Kadowaki et al., 2001).

CLONING

By genomic DNA database searching for open reading frames with homology
to the cytoplasmic domain of TLR4, followed by 5-prime RACE and PCR on a
placenta cDNA library, Chuang and Ulevitch (2000) and Du et al. (2000)
obtained cDNAs encoding TLR7, TLR8 (300366), and TLR9. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 1,049-amino acid TLR7 type I transmembrane protein
has a signal peptide, multiple leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and a
cysteine-rich region in its extracellular domain. Its cytoplasmic domain
has the characteristic TLR-IL1R (TIR) sequences found in this family of
proteins. By PCR on cDNA libraries, Chuang and Ulevitch (2000) detected
predominant expression of TLR7 in lung, placenta, and spleen, with lower
expression in lymph node and tonsil. By RT-PCR analysis, Du et al.
(2000) found expression in lung, brain, spleen, small intestine, and
stomach.

Using RT-PCR and ELISA analysis, Kadowaki et al. (2001) defined the
differential expression of TLR1 through TLR10 and the
pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition profiles and cytokine
production patterns of monocytes and dendritic cell precursors. They
concluded that neither monocytes nor dendritic cell precursors can
respond to all microbial antigens and that they have limited functional
plasticity.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Chuang and Ulevitch (2000) and Du et al.
(2000) determined that the TLR7 gene contains 3 exons. However, only the
initiator methionine is encoded on exon 2, and the remainder of the
protein is encoded on exon 3. Du et al. (2000) stated that the TLR7 gene
spans approximately 23 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chuang and Ulevitch (2000) and Du et al.
(2000) mapped the TLR7 gene to Xp22.3-p22.2, approximately 16 kb
centromeric to the TLR8 gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Using luciferase analysis, Chuang and Ulevitch (2000) showed that
expression of a chimeric TLR7 containing its transmembrane and
cytoplasmic domains, but not overexpression of full-length TLR7,
activated nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; 164011).

Imidazoquinolines are potent synthetic activators of immune cells with
antiviral and antitumor properties. Using macrophages from wildtype and
Myd88 (602170)-deficient mice, Hemmi et al. (2002) showed that 2
imidazoquinolines, imiquimod and resiquimod, which are active against
genital warts and genital herpes, respectively, induce tumor necrosis
factor (TNF; 191160) and interleukin-12 (IL12; see 161560) cytokines and
activate NFKB only in wildtype cells, implying that the activation is
through a TLR. Macrophages from mice deficient in Tlr7 but not other
Tlrs produced no detectable cytokines in response to these
imidazoquinolines. In addition, the imidazoquinolines induced
dose-dependent proliferation of splenic B cells and the activation of
intracellular signaling cascades in cells from wildtype but not Tlr7 -/-
mice. Luciferase analysis established that expression of human TLR7, but
not TLR2 or TLR4, in human embryonic kidney cells results in NFKB
activation in response to resiquimod. Injection of this compound into
wildtype but not Tlr7 -/- mice induced increased serum concentration of
cytokines. Hemmi et al. (2002) concluded that TLR7 is required for
imidazoquinoline-induced immune responses and signal cascade activation.
They suggested that viral products may themselves activate TLR7 or that
viral infection may generate an endogenous ligand that interacts with
TLR7 in a manner analogous to that seen in Drosophila.

Using luciferase analysis, Lee et al. (2003) showed that a number of
antiviral guanine analogs that induce NFKB activation, cytokine
production, and expression of costimulatory molecules do so through
stimulation of TLR7, but not other TLRs, in an endosomal
acidification-dependent manner.

Using quantitative RT-PCR, Nagase et al. (2003) found that TLRs 1
through 10 were all expressed at varying levels in neutrophils, but only
certain TLRs were expressed in eosinophils. TLR7 was unique among TLRs
in that its expression was higher in eosinophils than neutrophils. Among
various TLR ligands, only an artificial ligand of TLR7 and TLR8
(300366), which was not constitutively expressed in eosinophils,
regulated expression of the adhesion molecules CD11B (ITGAM; 120980) and
L-selectin (SELL; 153240) and induced superoxide generation. Incubation
of eosinophils with IFNG (147570) upregulated TLR7 and TLR8 expression
and further enhanced adhesion molecule expression in the presence of the
TLR7/TLR8 ligand.

Diebold et al. (2004) confirmed that mouse plasmacytoid dendritic cells
(PDCs) expressing B220 (PTPRC; 151460) but not Cd11b were resistant to
suppression of Ifna (147660) production mediated by influenza virus NS1
protein, suggesting that PDCs use a dsRNA-independent pathway for
recognizing influenza. Chloroquine inhibited influenza-induced Ifna
production, indicating that recognition of the virus occurs in the
endosomal compartment. Ifna production in response to live or
inactivated influenza virus or to viral genomic or host ssRNA required
the presence of Myd88 and Tlr7, but not other TLRs.

Heil et al. (2004) showed that GU nucleosides, but not other nucleoside
combinations, and the GU-rich sequence from the U5 region of HIV-1
induced TNF, IFNA, IL12p40 (161561), and IL6 (147620) production by
CD123 (IL3RA; 308385)-positive or BDCA4 (NRP1; 602069)-positive PDCs.
Mouse DCs deficient in Tlr7, but not those deficient in Tlr3 (603029) or
Tlr9, were unable to respond to GU-rich ssRNA. In contrast, TLR8 was
required for responsiveness to ssRNA in transfected human cells,
supporting the observation of species-specific differences for TLR7 and
TLR8. Heil et al. (2004) concluded that single-stranded GU-rich RNA is a
natural ligand for mouse Tlr7 and human TLR8. They proposed that
recognition occurs in endosomal or lysosomal compartments, because Tlr7
and TLR8 signaling requires acidification of these compartments.

Hornung et al. (2005) attempted to use small interfering RNA (siRNA)
duplexes to downregulate TLR9 (605474) in plasmacytoid dendritic cells
(PDCs), the major producers of type I IFN upon viral infection.
Surprisingly, they found that some siRNA sequences, notably those
containing 5-prime-GUCCUUCAA-3-prime, potently stimulated IFNA
production by BDCA4-positive PDCs. Wildtype mice, but not Tlr7-deficient
mice, injected with immunostimulatory siRNA when complexed with cationic
liposomes had systemic immune responses comparable to those observed in
response to CpG, the TLR9 ligand, including serum Ifna and splenic
T-cell activation. Hornung et al. (2005) concluded that
sequence-specific, TLR7-dependent immune recognition in PDCs is an
additional biologic activity of siRNA. They suggested that such
sequences should be termed immunostimulatory RNA (isRNA).

Yang et al. (2005) found that IFNA/IFNB (147640) and IFNL (IL29; 607403)
production in response to stimulation of TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 was
abolished in IRAK4 (606883)-deficient blood cells.

Lee et al. (2006) found that expression of an artificial ligand of TLR7
on liver cell lines induced anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV; see 609532)
immunity not only through the known antiviral agent, IFNA, but also
through IRF7 (605047). Inhibitors of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase
(IMPDH; see 146690) enhanced both IFN-dependent and -independent
antiviral activity. Immunohistochemistry showed TLR7 expression on
hepatocytes, but not fibroblasts, of HCV-infected livers. Lee et al.
(2006) suggested that a combination of TLR7 ligand and an IMPDH
inhibitor may provide an orally active approach to HCV therapy.

In a proof-of-concept study, Horsmans et al. (2005) found that a TLR7
agonist, isatoribine, administered to patients intravenously once daily
for 7 days caused a significant reduction of plasma HCV RNA without
significant side effects. The anti-HCV activity was associated with
dose-dependent induction of 2 interferon response genes, OAS1 (OAS1;
164350) and ISG15 (G1P2; 147571).

Using AM14 mouse B cells, Lau et al. (2005) showed that RNA-containing
immune complexes were recognized by the B-cell receptor and required
Tlr7 for B-cell activation. The response was enhanced in the presence of
Ifna, a cytokine linked with progression of systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE; 152700). Autoimmune-prone mice lacking Myd88 had markedly reduced
autoantibodies to chromatin, Sm (see SNRPD2; 601061), and rheumatoid
factor.

Lee et al. (2007) examined recognition of ssRNA viruses by mouse PDCs.
ELISA showed that live, but not ultraviolet-irradiated, Sendai virus
(SV) or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) induced Ifna production by
PDCs, whereas irradiation had no effect on Ifna production induced by
influenza virus. Recognition of all 3 viruses depended on Tlr7 in PDCs.
Analysis of responses to a VSV mutant revealed that cytosolic viral
replication intermediates provided a major stimulus for Ifna production.
Inhibition of autophagosome formation blocked VSV recognition and Ifna
production. VSV infection of healthy chimeric mice lacking Atg5
(604261), a gene essential for autophagosome formation, resulted in
diminished Ifna and Il12 secretion. Lee et al. (2007) concluded that
autophagy occurs constitutively in PDCs and is required for recognition
of the ssRNA VSV virus, but not the dsDNA virus herpes simplex virus-1,
and for production of type I IFN.

Ewald et al. (2008) defined the route by which TLR9 (605474) and TLR7
exit the endoplasmic reticulum and travel to endolysosomes in mouse
macrophages and dendritic cells. The ectodomains of TLR9 and TLR7 are
cleaved in the endolysosome, such that no full-length protein is
detectable in the compartment where ligand is recognized. Notably,
although both the full-length and cleaved forms of TLR9 are capable of
binding ligand, only the processed form recruits MyD88 on activation,
indicating that this truncated receptor, rather than the full-length
form, is functional. Furthermore, conditions that prevent receptor
proteolysis, including forced TLR9 surface localization, render the
receptor nonfunctional. Ewald et al. (2008) proposed that ectodomain
cleavage represents a strategy to restrict receptor activation to
endolysosomal compartments and prevent TLRs from responding to self
nucleic acids.

Delgado et al. (2009) investigated the formalin-inactivated respiratory
syncytial virus (FIRSV) vaccine that failed to generate protective
neutralizing antibodies and instead induced enhanced respiratory disease
(ERD) in seronegative vaccinated children subsequently exposed to RSV in
the 1960s. They found that wildtype RSV induced protective immunity in
mice, whereas FIRSV or RSV inactivated by ultraviolet light (UVRSV)
instead induced ERD. Protective immunity was associated with antibody
affinity maturation and increased antibody avidity. Multiple injections
of UVRSV, but not FIRSV, could induce appropriate protective antibody
responses. Adding Tlr4, Tlr3, and Tlr7 agonists (LPS, poly(I:C), and
polyU, respectively), but not alum adjuvant, simultaneously with UVRSV
significantly increased antibody affinity and neutralizing capacity.
Delgado et al. (2009) concluded that safe and effective RSV vaccines for
infants will require neutralizing antibodies with similar avidity for
protective antigens to that elicited by live virus inoculation.

Using flow cytometry, Meier et al. (2009) found that PDCs from
HIV-1-negative women produced higher levels of IFNA (147660), but not
TNF (191160), in response to an HIV-1-derived TLR7 ligand compared with
PDCs from HIV-1-negative men. There was no significant difference
between men and women in response to a TLR9 ligand. Untreated women
chronically infected with HIV-1 had higher levels of CD8 (see
186910)-positive T-cell activation than men, after adjusting for viral
load. Meier et al. (2009) proposed that the faster progression to
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS; see 609423) in women than in
men, even with identical viral loads, may be due, in part, to higher
immune activation in women. They suggested that modulation of the TLR7
pathway in PDCs may help reduce HIV-1-associated pathology.

Guiducci et al. (2010) demonstrated that, in vitro and in vivo,
stimulation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) through TLR7 and TLR9
can account for the reduced activity of glucocorticoids to inhibit the
interferon pathway in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE;
152700) and in 2 lupus-prone mouse strains. The triggering of PDCs
through TLR7 and TLR9 by nucleic acid-containing immune complexes or by
synthetic ligands activates the NF-kappa-B (see 164011) pathway
essential for PDC survival. Glucocorticoids do not affect NF-kappa-B
activation in PDCs, preventing glucocorticoid induction of PDC death and
the consequent reduction of systemic IFN-alpha levels. Guiducci et al.
(2010) concluded that their findings unveiled a new role for self
nucleic acid recognition by TLRs and indicated that inhibitors of TLR7
and TLR9 signaling could prove to be effective corticosteroid-sparing
drugs.

By coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopic analysis, Baumann et
al. (2010) showed that CD14 (158120) interacted with TLR7 and TLR9 in
mouse and human cells and was required for TLR7- and TLR9-dependent
induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Cd14 was required for
Tlr9-dependent immune responses in mice and for optimal nucleic acid
uptake in mouse macrophages. Cd14 was dispensable for viral uptake in
mice, but it was required for triggering of TLR-dependent cytokine
responses. Baumann et al. (2010) concluded that CD14 has a dual role in
nucleic acid-mediated TLR activation by promoting selective uptake of
nucleic acids and acting as a coreceptor for endosomal TLR activation.

Kasturi et al. (2011) demonstrated that immunization of mice with
synthetic nanoparticles containing antigens plus ligands that signal
through TLR4 (603030) and TLR7 induces synergistic increases in
antigen-specific, neutralizing antibodies compared to immunization with
nanoparticles containing antigens plus a single TLR ligand. Consistent
with this, there was enhanced persistence of germinal centers and of
plasma cell responses, which persisted in the lymph nodes for more than
1.5 years. Surprisingly, there was no enhancement of the early
short-lived plasma cell response relative to that observed with single
TLR ligands. Molecular profiling of activated B cells isolated 7 days
after immunization indicated that there was early programming towards
B-cell memory. Antibody responses were dependent on direct triggering of
both TLRs on B cells and dendritic cells, as well as on T-cell help.
Immunization protected completely against lethal avian and swine
influenza virus strains in mice, and induced robust immunity against
pandemic H1N1 influenza in rhesus macaques.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using a candidate gene approach based on the observation that duplicated
Tlr7 promotes lupus-like disease in male mice (see ANIMAL MODEL), Shen
et al. (2010) identified and replicated an association of a SNP in the
3-prime UTR of TLR7, dbSNP rs3853839, with systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE; see 152700) in 9,274 Chinese, Japanese, and Korean patients and
controls (combined P = 6.5 x 10(-10)). The effect was stronger in males
than in females (odds ratio, male vs female = 2.33 vs 1.24; P = 4.1 x
10(-4)). Carriers of the G risk allele had increased TLR7 transcripts
and a more pronounced type I IFN signature than carriers of the C
allele. Shen et al. (2010) proposed that type I IFN and its pathway have
a causal role in human autoimmunity.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pisitkun et al. (2006) noted that lupus-prone male mice express the
Y-linked autoimmune accelerator (Yaa) genetic modifier. Microarray
analysis of follicular B-cell RNA, followed by PCR and FISH, uncovered a
4-Mb expansion of the pseudoautosomal region in Yaa males that resulted
in the duplication of 17 genes, including Tlr7, that are X chromosome
specific in wildtype mice. Stimulation of Yaa splenocytes with imiquimod
resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of Ikba (NFKBIA; 164008) and
increased Btk (300300)-dependent cellular proliferation compared with
wildtype mice. Treatment of lupus-prone Fcgr2b (604590) -/- mice with
imiquimod induced a switch from the production of antinuclear antibodies
to antinucleolar antibodies. Pisitkun et al. (2006) proposed that TLR7
may contribute to autoimmunity by inducing activation of B cells by
single-stranded RNA-containing antigens of nucleolar origin. They
concluded that Yaa represents an example of a copy number polymorphism
that results in phenotypic differences.

Using transcription profiling of mouse B cells bearing Yaa, Subramanian
et al. (2006) detected overexpression of a cluster of X-linked genes
that included Tlr7. FISH analysis demonstrated translocation of this X
chromosome segment onto the Yaa chromosome. The resulting 2-fold
overexpression of Tlr7 in male mice bearing Yaa led to dysregulation of
Tlr7-mediated activation of the innate immune response.

Using different mouse models of autoimmune diseases, Hayashi et al.
(2009) showed that low dose injection of a synthetic Tlr7 agonist
induced tolerance to Tlr7, Tlr2, and Tlr9 activators and limited the
course of joint and neural inflammation. This hyporesponsiveness was
independent of T and B lymphocytes, but it required bone marrow-derived
cells. Tlr7 tolerance did not cause global immunosuppression, as shown
by normal susceptibility to Listeria infection, and involved
upregulation of the TLR signaling inhibitors Irakm (IRAK3; 604459) and
Ship1 (INPP5D; 601582).

Town et al. (2009) found that mice lacking Tlr7 or Myd88 (602170), but
not those lacking Tlr9, had increased West Nile virus (WNV; see 610379)
viremia and susceptibility to lethal WNV infection. Although tissue
concentrations of most innate cytokines were increased, Cd45 (PTPRC;
151460)-positive leukocytes and Cd11b (ITGAM; 120980)-positive
macrophages failed to home to WNV-infected cells in Tlr7 -/- mice. This
failure was associated with reduced Il12p40 (IL12B; 161561) and Il23a
(605580) expression in Tlr7 -/- mice and Tlr7 -/- macrophages. Mice
lacking Il12b or Il23a, but not those lacking Il12a (161560), were more
susceptible to lethal WNV infection, similar to Tlr7 -/- mice. Town et
al. (2009) concluded that TLR7- and IL23-dependent responses are vital
to host defense by affecting immune cell homing to WNV-infected target
cells.

606165	TITLE *606165 BOL-LIKE; BOLL
;;BOULE, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; BOULE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Deletions encompassing the Y chromosomal DAZ genes (deleted in
azoospermia; 400003) are the most common molecularly defined cause of
infertility in humans. An array of 4 DAZ genes in 2 clusters is located
on the Y chromosome and encodes RNA-binding proteins with a common RNA
recognition motif and a series of 8 to 18 DAZ repeats consisting of 24
amino acids each that are rich in N, Y, and Q amino acid residues. DAZ
homologs, identified in diverse organisms, are required for germ cell
development but differ in null phenotypes and expression patterns. In
flies, disruption of the DAZ homolog 'Boule' causes male meiotic arrest
(Eberhart et al., 1996).

CLONING

Using the yeast 2-hybrid system with a DAZ/DAZL (601486) construct as
bait, Xu et al. (2001) identified an additional member of the human DAZ
gene family, BOULE. The protein encoded by human BOULE is more similar
to Drosophila Boule than to human DAZ or DAZL. The BOULE protein
contains a single RNA binding domain with signature RNP1 and RNP2
repeats. Extensive similarity is shared by the potential RNA binding
domains of fly Boule, human BOULE, DAZ, and DAZL. The protein predicted
by a mouse Boule cDNA clone was 86% identical to human BOULE.

GENE FUNCTION

Xu et al. (2001) found that human and mouse BOULE resemble the
invertebrate meiotic regulator Boule, the proposed ortholog of DAZ, in
sequence and expression pattern, and hence likely perform a similar
meiotic function. In contrast, human DAZ and DAZL are expressed much
earlier than BOULE in prenatal germ stem cells and spermatogonia; DAZL
also is expressed in female germ cells. These data suggested that
homologs of the DAZ gene family can be grouped into 2 subfamilies (BOULE
and DAZL) and that members of the DAZ family evolved from an ancestral
meiotic regulator, Boule, to assume distinct, yet overlapping, functions
in germ cell development.

Xu et al. (2003) reported that a human BOULE transgene was capable of
advancing meiosis in infertile Boule mutant flies. The authors proposed
that BOULE may encode a key conserved switch that regulates progression
of germ cells through meiosis in men.

In Drosophila, Boule is expressed in the prophase of the first meiotic
division and regulates the expression of 'twine,' a cdc25 phosphatase
required for entering the G2/M transition phase to complete the first
meiotic division. Luetjens et al. (2004) investigated whether a common
mechanism underlies the block of germ cell maturation observed in
idiopathic and nonidiopathic azoospermic patients with meiotic arrest
(270960). They examined, by immunohistochemistry, expression of BOULE
and CDC25A phosphatase protein (116947), the human homolog of Drosophila
'twine,' in 47 men with meiotic arrest, mixed atrophy, or normal
spermatogenesis. The presence of genetic alterations in the BOULE gene
was investigated by SSCP. BOULE protein expression in men with complete
spermatogenesis was restricted to stages from leptotene up to stages of
late spermatocytes, whereas CDC25A expression ranged from leptotene
spermatocytes to elongating spermatids. Although spermatocytes were
present in all testicular biopsies with meiotic arrest (28 testes),
BOULE protein expression was completely lacking. In addition, in nearly
all biopsies in which BOULE was absent, CDC25A was concomitantly
lacking. However, no mutations or polymorphisms in the BOULE gene were
identified that could explain the lack of BOULE or CDC25A expression.
The authors concluded that a major group of infertile men with meiotic
arrest lack BOULE protein and its putative target, CDC25A expression.
They also concluded that spermatogenic failure seems to arise from
factor(s) upstream of BOULE, which are possibly involved in regulating
transcription and/or translation of BOULE.

Kee et al. (2009) used a germ cell reporter to quantify and isolate
primordial germ cells derived from both male and female human embryonic
stem cells. By silencing and overexpressing genes that encode germ
cell-specific cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins (not transcription
factors), Kee et al. (2009) modulated human germ cell formation and
developmental progression and observed that human DAZL (601486)
functions in primordial germ cell formation, whereas closely related
genes DAZ (400003) and BOULE promote later stages of meiosis and
development of haploid gametes.

EVOLUTION

Phylogenetic analyses suggested to Xu et al. (2001) that the DAZ gene
family is composed of 2 subfamilies required for different stages of
germ cell development: DAZL for early germ cell function and Boule for
meiotic function. Boule is the ancestral gene that is conserved from
flies to humans, whereas DAZL arose in the early vertebrate lineage and
DAZ arrived on the Y chromosome during primate evolution. Thus, Xu et
al. (2001) referred to DAZL as the 'father' of DAZ; homologs are
required for both female and male germ cell development in other
organisms. They referred to Boule as the 'grandfather' of DAZ.

Xu et al. (2003) investigated the micro- and macroevolution of BOULE
within primates, mammals, and metazoans. Sequence divergence of BOULE
was unexpectedly low, and rapid evolution was not detectable.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid mapping, Xu et al. (2001) placed the human BOLL gene
on chromosome 2q33 and verified the location by fluorescence in situ
hybridization. The mouse Boule gene maps to chromosome 1, in a region
syntenic to human 2q33. A male sterile mouse mutation, jsd (juvenile
spermatogonial degeneration), maps to mouse chromosome 1 in that region.

ANIMAL MODEL

VanGompel and Xu (2010) generated Boule knockout mice and found it to be
required only for spermatogenesis, as in Drosophila. Meiosis completed
normally in the absence of Boule, and haploid round spermatids were
readily detected. However, round spermatids did not progress beyond step
6, revealing a novel role for Boule in spermiogenesis: the
differentiation of round spermatids into mature spermatozoa. Expression
of key regulators of spermiogenesis was unaffected in Boule -/- mice,
suggesting to the authors that Boule may regulate germ cell
differentiation through a novel pathway.

182205	TITLE *182205 SEX HORMONE-BINDING GLOBULIN; SHBG
;;ANDROGEN-BINDING PROTEIN; ABP;;
TESTOSTERONE-BINDING BETA-GLOBULIN; TEBG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a previously characterized liver cDNA as a probe, Gershagen et al.
(1989) isolated a liver-secreted plasma glycoprotein that binds sex
steroids. Screening of a human testis cDNA library resulted in the
isolation of 2 distinct cDNA forms. One was identical to the previously
characterized liver SHBG cDNA, thus suggesting that human SHBG and the
androgen-binding protein (ABP) produced by Sertoli cells are encoded by
the same gene. The second cDNA differed from the first by having exon 1
exchanged with a completely different sequence and exon 7 deleted.
Primer extension experiments showed that the alternatively spliced
transcript corresponding to the second cDNA is present in both liver and
testis. From the primary structure of the putative SHBG-gene-related
protein, Gershagen et al. (1989) deduced that the protein is very
different from SHBG and probably without steroid-binding activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

By Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA, Gershagen et al. (1989) found
evidence indicating that only 1 SHBG is present in the human haploid
genome. The gene has 8 exons.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Berube et al. (1990) localized the SHBG gene
to chromosome 17p13-p12. By the study of intersubspecies backcrosses,
Joseph et al. (1991) found that Shbg is located on mouse chromosome 11
in close linkage to several neurologic mutations, one of which, Tr, is
associated with male sterility. The fact that ABP-SHBG is found
throughout the rat brain suggested that these mutations may represent a
defect in Shbg.

GENE FUNCTION

Testosterone in plasma is present in both bound and unbound form; only
the unbound hormone is biologically active and available to tissues.
About 66% of testosterone is bound to testosterone-binding beta-globulin
(TEBG), 31% to albumin, and 1.5% to transcortin; 2% is unbound. The
regulatory function of TEBG is said to be well illustrated by female
hirsutism; although many hirsute women have normal levels of total
plasma testosterone, nearly all have depressed levels of TEBG, resulting
in increased levels of unbound testosterone (Wenn et al., 1977; Raj et
al., 1978).

In mice expressing an 11-kb human SHBG transgene and in HepG2
hepatoblastoma cells, Selva et al. (2007) demonstrated that the
monosaccharides glucose and fructose reduced human SHBG production by
hepatocytes, irrespective of the presence of insulin, by downregulation
of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4A (HNF4A; 600281) and replacement of HNF4A
by COUP-TFI (NR2F1; 132890) at a cis-element within the human SHBG
promoter, coincident with repression of its transcriptional activity.
Dose-dependent reduction of HNF4A in HepG2 cells occurred in concert
with parallel increases in cellular palmitate levels and could be
mimicked by treatment with palmitoyl-CoA; inhibition of lipogenesis
prevented monosaccharide-induced downregulation of HNF4A and reduced
SHBG expression in HepG2 cells. Selva et al. (2007) concluded that
monosaccharide-induced lipogenesis reduces hepatic HNF4A levels, which
in turn attenuates SHBG expression, and noted that this provides a
biologic explanation for the sensitivity of SHBG as a biomarker of the
metabolic syndrome.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Cavalli-Sforza et al. (1977) developed an ingenious method for detection
of genetic variation in plasma proteins, namely, electrophoretic
screening after treatment with radioactive ligands such as vitamins,
hormones, metal ions and drugs. This is essentially a method of
'staining' the protein comparable to the methods using dyes. With this
approach they identified polymorphism of testosterone-binding
beta-globulin, as well as a possible silent allele. By polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (PAGE), Luckock and Cavalli-Sforza (1983) identified
4 electrophoretic variants, which they suggested result from
combinations of 3 alleles, designated N ('normal'), S ('slow'), and O
('absent'). The first 2 are codominant and the third recessive. The
frequencies of the 3 alleles in white Americans were, respectively,
0.68, 0.11, 0.21; in black Americans, 0.65, 0.14, 0.22; in Japanese
Americans, 0.59, 0.09, 0.32. Phenotype frequencies and segregation from
various crosses supported simple mendelian inheritance of an autosomal
gene.

By investigating neuraminidase-treated serum samples using isoelectric
focusing (IEF) followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and
immunostaining, van Baelen et al. (1992) distinguished 3 patterns
consistent with the expression of a biallelic autosomal system. They
published data on allele frequencies in many populations and found
frequencies of the common allele (SHBG*1) varying from 0.848 in Chinese
to 0.985 in Balinese; monomorphism was found only in Australian
Aborigines, all 47 of whom were SHBG*1 homozygotes. Van Baelen et al.
(1992) found no significant difference for allele frequencies among
hirsute Belgian women. They also presented evidence that the subunit
produced by the SHBG*2 allele has a higher molecular mass than the one
produced by the SHBG*1 allele and that the 3 SHBG genotypes have
identical binding characteristics for 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Power et al. (1992) demonstrated in a Belgian patient homozygous for a
variant isoelectric focusing pattern that a point mutation was present
in exon 8, creating an additional site for N-linked glycosylation.
Expression studies showed that steroid binding was not affected. Hardy
et al. (1995) found the same mutation in Mexican subjects who were
heterozygous for the variant IEF phenotype. Denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to localize the mutation in these
subjects and to purify the variant allele for DNA sequence analysis. A
GAC-to-AAC transition in codon 327 caused an asp-to-asn substitution in
the protein (D327N). The site of the mutation does not lie within the
predicted steroid-binding site of the molecule. The finding in these
widely separated populations suggested that the SHBG gene is biallelic
worldwide. The polymorphism was not associated with any pathologic
condition.

Xita et al. (2003) investigated the possible association of the
functional (TAAAA)n polymorphism in the promoter of the SHBG gene
(Hogeveen et al., 2001) with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS; 184700)
and SHBG levels. They studied 185 women with PCOS and 324 normal
controls. Genotyping revealed 6 (TAAAA)n alleles containing 6 to 11
repeats. The distribution of these alleles was different in the 2
groups. Women with PCOS had a significantly greater frequency of longer
(TAAAA)n alleles (more than 8 repeats) than normal women who had shorter
alleles (fewer than 8 repeats) in higher frequency (P = 0.001). In the
PCOS group, carriers of the longer allele genotypes had lower SHBG
levels than those with shorter alleles. The authors concluded that SHBG
may be a susceptibility gene for PCOS and may provide the genetic link
for the developmental origin hypothesis for PCOS that was proposed on
the basis of experimental observations in prenatally androgenized sheep
and primates (Abbott et al., 2002).

In a population of 303 women referred for hirsutism, Cousin et al.
(2004) investigated the relationship between the D327N mutation in SHBG
exon 8, the pentanucleotide repeat polymorphism (TAAAA)n in the SHBG
5-prime untranslated region, and SHBG levels. The D327N mutant allele
was associated with higher SHBG levels than was the wildtype.
Multivariate analysis showed that BMI, PCOS status, and D327N
polymorphism influenced plasma SHBG concentrations, each of these
parameters contributing independently of the others. A strong
disequilibrium linkage was found between the D327N variant allele and an
allele with 8 TAAAA repeats (P less than 0.0001). The authors suggested
that this linkage disequilibrium could mask the effect of the TAAAA
repeat polymorphism on SHBG concentration in vivo. Nevertheless, SHBG
levels in patients who were homozygous for 6 repeats were significantly
(P = 0.043) higher than in 9-repeat homozygous patients and lay between
the two for 8-repeat homozygous patients. Results supported the notion
that polymorphism within the coding sequence and, potentially, in the
regulatory sequence of the SHBG gene is associated with circulating SHBG
levels and may represent part of the genetic background of sex steroid
hormone activity in humans.

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the SHBG
gene and type 2 diabetes, see 125853.

- SHBG Circulating Level Quantitative Trait Locus

Eriksson et al. (2006) studied whether either of 2 polymorphisms in the
SHBG gene promoter, a (TAAAA)n microsatellite and the SNP dbSNP
rs1799941, are associated with serum levels of SHBG (613498), sex
steroids, or bone mineral density (BMD) in men. In both cohorts,
(TAAAA)n and dbSNP rs1799941 genotypes were associated with serum levels
of SHBG (P less than 0.001), dihydrotestosterone (P less than 0.05), and
5-alpha-androstane-3-alpha,17-beta-diol glucuronides (P less than 0.05).
In the elderly men, they were also associated with testosterone and BMD
at all hip bone sites. Eriksson et al. (2006) concluded that
polymorphisms in the SHBG promoter predict serum levels of SHBG,
androgens, and glucuronidated androgen metabolites, and hip BMD in men.

In the NCI-Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium using 874 SNPs
in 37 candidate genes in the sex steroid hormone pathway, Ahn et al.
(2009) identified a G-A variant (dbSNP rs1799941) located 67 bp upstream
from the transcription start site of the SHBG gene associated with
increased mean circulating levels of SHBG in 4,720 Caucasian men (p =
4.52 x 10(-21); 26.9% increase in AA homozygotes versus wildtype
homozygotes). The relationship between dbSNP rs1799941 was consistent
across the 5 cohorts in the study, age, BMI, and case-control status.
Additionally, dbSNP rs1799941 was also strongly associated with
increased mean circulating levels of testosterone in 4,678 Caucasian men
(p = 7.54 x 10(-15); 14.3% increase in AA homozygotes versus wildtype
homozygotes). Since clearance and bioavailability of testosterone are
related to SHBG levels, Ahn et al. (2009) used regression analysis to
show that also tended to predict SHBG adjusted-testosterone levels (p =
1.33 x 10(-3)).

HISTORY

Gross and Horton (1971) presented evidence indicating 'dominant'
segregation of the trait and low testosterone-binding protein, and
suggested Y-linkage. Hecht and Kimberling (1971) pointed out that since
the Y chromosome represents only about 2% of the human male haploid
genome, Bayesian correction of the estimate of Y-linkage reduces the
value to 1 in 3.

611764	TITLE *611764 CORNIFELIN; CNFN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential screening of cDNA libraries from normal and psoriatic
(see 177900) human skin in order to search for genes upregulated in
psoriatic skin, Michibata et al. (2004) cloned CNFN. The deduced
112-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 12.3 kD and
shares 97% amino acid identity with mouse Cnfn. Northern blot analysis
detected a 0.7-kb transcript in human uterus, cervix, and fetal skin
only. Michibata et al. (2004) stated that Robinson et al. (1997)
obtained an amino acid sequence ARELKIRE by cyanogen bromide treatment
of cornified envelope fragments that matches the C-terminal sequence of
CNFN. Michibata et al. (2004) suggested that CNFN is a component of the
cornified envelope and may be crosslinked to other components.

GENE FUNCTION

Using transgenic mice expressing human CNFN, Michibata et al. (2004)
showed that overexpression of CNFN was associated with a decrease in
endogenous loricrin (LOR; 152445) expression and an increase in
involucrin (IVL; 147360) expression. However, they observed no
detectable differences of epidermal differentiation in the
CNFN-transgenic mice.

GENE STRUCTURE

Michibata et al. (2004) determined that the CNFN gene contains 4 exons
spanning 3.3 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Michibata et al. (2004) mapped the CNFN
gene to chromosome 19q13. They mapped the mouse Cnfn gene chromosome 7
in a region showing homology of synteny to human 19q13.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using PCR-based expression profiling analysis of RNA from 7 normal and
10 psoriatic skin samples, Michibata et al. (2004) found an 18.5-fold
increase in CNFN expression in psoriatic skin compared to normal skin.
Increases of 14.3-fold and 4.6-fold in CNFN expression were detected in
atopic dermatitis and mycosis fungoides skin samples, respectively,
compared to normal skin. In situ hybridization detected CNFN expression
in the granular cell layer in normal skin. CNFN expression in psoriatic
skin, but not normal or uninvolved psoriatic skin, was detected up to
the upper-spinous layer. Immunohistochemical studies detected CNFN
protein in the horny cell layer of normal skin, as well as uninvolved
and involved psoriatic skin.

;;ATP11, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; ATP11
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In yeast, Atp11 is required for the proper assembly of the F1 component
of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. By searching an EST database
for sequences similar to yeast Atp11, followed by PCR and 5-prime RACE
of a human fetal liver cDNA library, Wang et al. (2001) obtained a
partial ATPAF1 cDNA. By database analysis they identified the complete
transcript, which encodes a deduced 328-amino acid protein with an
N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. EST database analysis and
SAGE data indicated that ATPAF1 is widely expressed at moderate
abundance.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Wang et al. (2001) found that ATPAF1
interacted directly with the ATP synthase F1 beta subunit (ATP5B;
102910), but not with the F1 alpha subunit (ATP5A1; 164360).

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang et al. (2001) determined that the ATPAF1 gene contains 9 exons and
spans at least 32.5 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wang et al. (2001) mapped the ATPAF1 gene
to chromosome 1p33-p32.2.
