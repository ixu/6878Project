DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SCRIB is a cytoplasmic multimodular scaffold protein targeted to
epithelial adherens junctions and neuronal presynaptic compartments.
SCRIB and its orthologs in vertebrates and invertebrates participate in
cell polarization (summary by Nola et al., 2008).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated myeloid leukemia
cell line cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1995) cloned SCRIB, which they
designated KIAA0147. The nucleotide sequence contains a central GAG
repeat that occurs 19 times within a 36-triplet stretch, creating a
glutamine-rich region in the deduced 1,551-amino acid protein. KIAA0147
shares 32% amino acid identity with yeast adenylyl cyclase over a
302-amino acid region. Northern blot analysis revealed expression in all
tissues examined, with highest expression in skeletal muscle.

Nakagawa and Huibregtse (2000) identified a 220-kD protein within the
lysate of a cervical carcinoma cell line that interacts with human
papillomavirus E6 protein. By mass spectrometry of tryptic fragments,
followed by searching an EST database, they determined that the
E6-interacting protein is KIAA0147, the human homolog of Drosophila
Scrib, with which it shares 35% amino acid identity. SCRIB contains a
series of N-terminal leucine-rich repeats and 4 central PDZ domains.
Comparison with the Drosophila protein suggested that the KIAA0147 cDNA
lacks 5-prime sequences specifying approximately 67 amino acids.

Using a positional cloning approach, Murdoch et al. (2003) identified
Scrb1 as the mouse gene mutated in the 'circletail' (crc) phenotype,
which is characterized by craniorachischisis, a severe neural tube
defect. RT-PCR detected several Scrb1 alternative transcripts resulting
from inclusion or exclusion of exons 16, 29, or 36. During mouse
development, expression of Scrb1 showed a dynamic pattern of expression
in a wide variety of organ systems, as well as in neuroepithelium during
initiation of neural tube closure. Expression of Scrb1 overlapped with
expression of Vangl2 (600533), the gene mutated in 'loop-tail,' a
similar defect of neural tube closure. Coexpression was found in
neuroepithelium, ventricular myocardium, eyelid, lung epithelium,
whisker follicles, and the epithelial lining of the stomach.

GENE FUNCTION

Nakagawa and Huibregtse (2000) determined that SCRIB binds directly to
the human papillomavirus E6 protein. They showed that the binding is
mediated by the PDZ domain of SCRIB and a C-terminal epitope of E6.
Fluorescence-labeled SCRIB localized to the periphery of canine kidney
cells, where it colocalized with ZO1 (TJP1; 601009) in tight junctions.
Nakagawa and Huibregtse (2000) determined that SCRIB is targeted for
ubiquitination by a complex of E6 and UBE3A (601623) in vitro and that
expression of E6 induces degradation of SCRIB and DLG (601014) in vivo.
E6 coexpression resulted in loss of integrity of tight junctions, as
measured by ZO1 localization, and this effect was dependent on the
PDZ-binding epitope of E6.

Montcouquiol et al. (2003) showed that a mutation in the Vangl2 gene
results in significant disruptions in the polarization of stereociliary
bundles in mouse cochlea as a result of defects in the direction of
movement and/or anchoring of the kinocilium within each hair cell.
Similar but less severe defects are observed in animals containing a
mutation in the LAP protein family gene Scrb1. Polarization defects in
animals heterozygous for Vangl2 and Scrb1 are comparable with Vangl2
homozygotes, demonstrating genetic interactions between these genes in
the regulation of planar cell polarity in mammals.

Zhan et al. (2008) showed that depletion of Scribble in mammary
epithelia disrupted cell polarity, blocked 3-dimensional morphogenesis,
inhibited apoptosis, and induced dysplasia in vivo that progressed to
tumors after long latency. Like depletion, mislocalization of Scribble
from cell-cell junctions was sufficient to promote cell transformation.
Spontaneous mammary tumors in mice and humans showed both downregulated
and mislocalized Scribble. Zhan et al. (2008) concluded that Scribble
has a role as a tumor suppressor.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Nola et al. (2008) showed that SCRIB
interacted with PAK1 (602590) and PAK2 (605022), serine/threonine
kinases crucial for cell migration. Immunohistochemical analysis showed
that SCRIB and PAK colocalized at the leading edge of migrating human
epithelial cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts in response to
chemoattractants. Knockdown studies with human breast epithelial cells
showed that SCRIB was required for localization of PAK and beta-PIX
(ARHGEF7; 605477) at the leading edge of migrating cells, PAK
activation, formation of membrane protrusions at the leading edge, and
cell motility. Circletail mouse fibroblasts also showed reduced motility
in response to serum stimulation compared with wildtype fibroblasts. The
cell migration defect of SCRIB-deficient cells appeared to be due to
loss of PAK activation, since constitutively active PAK rescued
chemotaxis in SCRIB-deficient cells. Depletion of beta-PIX or SCRIB
caused comparable defects in cell migration and PAK activation. Nola et
al. (2008) concluded that SCRIB participates in lamellipodia formation
through activation of PAK at the leading edge of migratory cells.

Dow et al. (2008) found that knockdown of SCRIB via small hairpin RNA
cooperated with oncogenic RAS (HRAS; 190020) or RAF (RAF1; 164760)
mutants to promote an invasive phenotype in MCF10A breast epithelia
cells. The invasive phenotype was predominantly due to loss of
SCRIB-dependent suppression of MAP kinase signaling.

GENE STRUCTURE

Murdoch et al. (2003) determined that the mouse Scrb1 gene contains 38
exons and spans about 23 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SCRIB
gene to chromosome 8 (TMAP RH25368).

ANIMAL MODEL

Circletail (crc) is a mouse phenotype characterized by
craniorachischisis, a severe neural tube defect. Murdoch et al. (2003)
determined that the circletail mutation is a 1-bp insertion in the Scrb1
gene, resulting in a frameshift that leads to premature termination of
the protein.

Phillips et al. (2007) found that crc mouse mutants developed heart
malformation and cardiomyopathy attributable to abnormalities in
cardiomyocyte organization within the early heart tube. N-cadherin
(CDH2; 114020) was lost from the cardiomyocyte cell membrane and
cell-cell adhesion was disrupted. This resulted in abnormalities in
heart looping and in formation of both the trabeculae and compact
myocardium, which ultimately resulted in cardiac misalignment defects
and ventricular noncompaction. Mislocalization of Vangl2 (600533) in
crc/crc cardiomyocytes suggested that wildtype Scrib acts in the planar
cell polarity pathway in the heart. Moreover, heterozygosity for
mutations in both Scrib and Vangl2 caused cardiac defects similar to
those found in homozygous mutants for each gene but without other major
defects.

603368	TITLE *603368 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 6; CDK6
;;PLSTIRE
CDK6/MLL FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) regulate major cell cycle
transitions in eukaryotic cells. By RT-PCR of HeLa cell mRNA with
degenerate primers corresponding to conserved regions of CDC2 (116940),
Meyerson et al. (1992) identified cDNAs encoding 7 novel human protein
kinases. They designated 1 of these proteins PLSTIRE, following the
accepted practice of naming cdc2-related kinases based on the amino acid
sequence of the region corresponding to the conserved PSTAIRE motif of
CDC2. The predicted 326-amino acid PLSTIRE protein shares 47% and 71%
identity with CDC2 and PSK-J3 (CDK4; 123829). The in vitro
transcription/translation product has an apparent molecular weight of 40
kD by SDS-PAGE. Northern blot analysis revealed that the PLSTIRE gene
was expressed as 13-, 8.5-, and 6-kb mRNAs in several human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Meyerson and Harlow (1994) demonstrated that PLSTIRE is associated with
cyclins D1 (168461), D2 (123833), and D3 (123834) in lysates of human
cells and is activated by coexpression with D-type cyclins in Sf9 insect
cells. PLSTIRE immunoprecipitated from human cells exhibited significant
kinase activity, and was able to phosphorylate RB1 (614041). Based on
these findings, they renamed the protein CDK6 (cyclin-dependent kinase
6). In primary T cells that were stimulated to enter the cell cycle,
cellular CDK6 kinase activity first appeared in mid-G1, prior to the
activation of any previously characterized CDK. Meyerson and Harlow
(1994) suggested that CDK6, and the homologous CDK4, link growth factor
stimulation with the onset of cell cycle progression.

Guan et al. (1994) proposed that CDK4 and CDK6 are physiologic RB1
kinases that are inhibited by the p14 (600431), p16 (600160), and p18
(603369) CDK inhibitors. This inhibition prevents the phosphorylation of
RB1 and keeps RB1 in its active growth-suppressing state. See CDKN2D
(600927).

Harbour et al. (1999) presented evidence that phosphorylation of the
C-terminal region of RB by CDK4/CDK6 initiates successive intramolecular
interactions between the C-terminal region and the central pocket. The
initial interaction displaces histone deacetylase from the pocket,
blocking active transcriptional repression by RB. This facilitates a
second interaction that leads to phosphorylation of the pocket by CDK2
and disruption of pocket structure. These intramolecular interactions
provide a molecular basis for sequential phosphorylation of RB by
CDK4/CDK6 and CDK2. CDK4/CDK6 is activated early in G1, blocking active
repression by RB. However, it is not until near the end of G1, when
cyclin E (see 123837) is expressed and CDK2 is activated, that RB is
prevented from binding and inactivating E2F (189971).

Veiga-Fernandes and Rocha (2003) showed that, in contrast to naive CD8
(see 186910) T cells in G0/G1 arrest, memory CD8 T cells in G0/G1 arrest
have low expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1)
(CDKN1B; 600778) and high CDK6 activity. They found that preactivated
CDK6 is associated with cyclin D3 (CCND3) in the cytoplasm, facilitating
the switch to S phase and the rapid division of memory cells.
Veiga-Fernandes and Rocha (2003) concluded that naive T cells are in the
classic state of G0/G1 arrest with low amounts of D cyclins and CDK6 and
CDK2 (116953) activity but high levels of CDKN1B, whereas memory cells
have high levels of CCND3 and CDK6 activity in a distinct G0/G1 state.

Using microarray analysis, Lena et al. (2012) found that microRNA-191
(MIR191; 615150) was significantly upregulated in normal human neonatal
epidermal keratinocytes (HEKn) following development of senescence in
culture. Bioinformatic analysis and reporter gene assays revealed
functional MIR191 target sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of transcripts
for CDK6 and the AT-rich binding protein SATB1 (602075). Western blot
analysis confirmed that ectopic expression of MIR191 in HEKn cells
caused downregulation of SATB1 and CDK6, concomitant with decreased cell
proliferation and expression of senescence markers.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Bullrich et al. (1995)
mapped the CDK6 gene to 7p13-cen. However, radiation hybrid analysis and
inclusion within a mapped clone place the CDK6 gene at 7q21-q22 (TMAP
SGC34899).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Because of sequence and functional similarities between CDK4 (123829),
mutations in which cause familial melanoma (609048), and CDK6, Shennan
et al. (2000) hypothesized that germline mutations in CDK6 might
predispose to melanoma. They detected no CDK6 mutations, however, within
the p16-binding domain in index cases from 60 melanoma-prone kindreds
lacking germline mutations in the coding regions of either CDKN2A or
within the entire CDK4 coding region. They concluded that germline
mutations in CDK6 do not make a significant contribution to melanoma
predisposition.

For a discussion of an association between variation in the CDK6 gene
and stature, see STQTL11 (612223).

CYTOGENETICS

In an infant diagnosed at the age of 3 weeks with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL; 613065) after presenting with hepatosplenomegaly and
marked leukocytosis, Raffini et al. (2002) found a 3-way rearrangement
of the MLL (159555), AF4 (159557), and CDK6 genes. By reverse-panhandle
PCR, they identified a breakpoint junction of CDK6 from band 7q21-q22
and MLL intron 9. CDK6 is overexpressed or disrupted by translocation in
many cancers, e.g., T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (Chilosi et al.,
1998), T cell ALL, natural killer/T cell nasal lymphoma (Lien et al.,
2000), and glioblastoma multiforme (Costello et al., 1997). B cell
splenic lymphomas with villous lymphocytes are characterized by
t(2;7)(p12;q21) translocation juxtaposing CDK6 to the IGKC gene
(147200). The patient of Raffini et al. (2002) had an in-frame CDK6-MLL
transcript along with an in-frame MLL-AF4 transcript.

ANIMAL MODEL

Malumbres et al. (2004) found that Cdk6-null mice were viable and
developed normally, although hematopoiesis was slightly impaired.
Embryos defective for Cdk4 and Cdk6 died during the late stages of
embryonic development due to severe anemia. However, these embryos
displayed normal organogenesis, and most cell types proliferated
normally. In vitro, embryonic fibroblasts lacking Cdk4 and Cdk6
proliferated and became immortal upon serial passage. Quiescent
Cdk4/Cdk6-null cells responded to serum stimulation and entered S phase
with normal kinetics, although with lower efficiency. These results
indicated that D-type cyclin-dependent kinases are not essential for
cell cycle entry and suggested the existence of alternative mechanisms
to initiate cell proliferation upon mitogenic stimulation.

154950	TITLE *154950 MAX PROTEIN; MAX
;;MYC-ASSOCIATED FACTOR X
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The MAX protein is the most conserved dimerization component of the MYC
(190080)-MAX-MXD1 (600021) network of basic helix-loop-helix leucine
zipper (bHLHZ) transcription factors that regulate cell proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis. While heterodimerization of MAX with MYC
activates and mediates its transcription and transforming activity,
heterodimerization of MAX with MXD1 family members antagonize
MYC-dependent cell transformation by transcriptional repression of the
same E-box target DNA sequences. The conservation of the MAX sequence is
particularly high in the bHLHZ domain, which is involved in
protein-protein interactions and DNA binding (Nair and Burley, 2003;
Comino-Mendez et al., 2011).

CLONING

Wagner et al. (1992) demonstrated that 2 species of RNA hybridized
specifically to a MAX cDNA probe in all human and murine cell lines
tested. Unlike MYC, the steady state level of MAX RNA was not
significantly modulated with respect to proliferation or
differentiation. Unlike MYC RNA, MAX RNA was relatively stable with a
half-life of more than 3 hours, and therefore it did not exhibit the
characteristic short half-life of RNAs encoded by most immediate early
genes. The predicted tertiary structure of MAX closely resembles that of
MYC, and it was on the basis of the
basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine-zipper (bHLHZ) homology that Prendergast
et al. (1991) cloned the cDNA encoding MAX.

Comino-Mendez et al. (2011) stated that the 160-amino acid MAX protein
contains an N-terminal bHLHZ domain and 6 casein kinase II
phosphorylation sites.

GENE STRUCTURE

The complete structure of the MAX gene was reported by Blackwood and
Eisenman (1991).

Comino-Mendez et al. (2011) noted that the MAX gene contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ chromosomal hybridization, Wagner et al. (1992)
demonstrated that the MAX gene is located on chromosome 14q23. This
region of chromosome 14 is involved in deletions in B-cell chronic
lymphocytic leukemia and malignant lymphomas and in the 12;14
translocation in uterine leiomyomas. Gilladoga et al. (1992) similarly
mapped the MAX gene to chromosome 14q22-q24 by isotopic in situ
hybridization and to mouse chromosome 12 in region D.

GENE FUNCTION

Zervos et al. (1995) described MXI2 (600289), a protein that interacts
with the MAX protein.

Grandori et al. (1996) identified DDX18 (606355) as a direct in vivo
target of Myc and Max and hypothesized that Myc may exert its effects on
cell behavior through proteins that affect RNA structure and metabolism.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Nair and Burley (2003) determined the x-ray structures of the bHLHZ
domains of MYC-MAX and MAD (600021)-MAX heterodimers bound to their
common DNA target, the enhancer box (E box) hexanucleotide
(5-prime-CACGTG-3-prime), at 1.9- and 2.0-angstrom resolution,
respectively. E-box recognition by these 2 structurally similar
transcription factor pairs determines whether a cell will divide and
proliferate (MYC-MAX) or differentiate and become quiescent (MAD-MAX).
Deregulation of MYC has been implicated in the development of many human
cancers, including Burkitt lymphoma, neuroblastomas, and small cell lung
cancers. Both quasisymmetric heterodimers resemble the symmetric MAX
homodimer, albeit with marked structural differences in the coiled-coil
leucine zipper regions that explain preferential homo- and heteromeric
dimerization of these 3 evolutionarily related DNA-binding proteins. The
MYC-MAX heterodimer, but not its MAD-MAX counterpart, dimerizes to form
a bivalent heterotetramer, explaining how MYC can upregulate expression
of genes with promoters bearing widely separated E boxes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using exome sequencing in 3 unrelated families with bilateral
pheochromocytoma (171300), Comino-Mendez et al. (2011) identified 3
different heterozygous germline mutations in the MAX gene
(154950.0001-154950.0003) that segregated with the disease. A follow-up
study of 59 patients with pheochromocytoma identified 5 additional
mutations (see, e.g., 154950.0004-154950.0005). Studies of tumor tissue
showed a lack of full-length MAX protein and loss of heterozygosity
(LOH) of the MAX allele, which resulted from paternal uniparental disomy
(UPD) and loss of the maternal allele. This LOH constituted the somatic
second-hit of the Knudson hypothesis. The paternal origin of the mutated
allele detected in 6 families suggested preferential paternal
transmission of the disease (p = 0.031). In addition, 2 children who
inherited the mutation from their mother and 2 obligate carriers from
another family did not develop tumors, further supporting this theory.
Eight of 12 cases had bilateral tumors, and 3 of 8 probands had
metastases at diagnosis. Overall, the findings indicated that MAX acts
as a classic tumor suppressor gene. Normal lymphocytes from patients
showed absence of methylation of the MAX promoter and biallelic
expression of MAX, which ruled out an imprinting-mediated effect on MAX
expression. Comino-Mendez et al. (2011) pointed to the study of Hopewell
and Ziff (1995), who showed loss of Max repression ability in rat
pheochromocytoma cells, suggesting that MAX mutations can lead to
deregulation of oncogenic MYC.

NOMENCLATURE

The designation MAX came from MYC associated factor X (Eisenman, 1994).
The murine homolog of MAX is referred to as Myn (Prendergast et al.,
1991).

ANIMAL MODEL

Hopewell and Ziff (1995) showed that a functional Max protein is not
expressed in the rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 due to a
mutant form of Max lacking the C terminus. The mutant protein was
incapable of repressing transcription from an E-box element.
Reintroduction of Max into PC12 cells resulted in repression of
E-box-dependent transcription and a reduction in growth rate. The
ability of these cells to divide, differentiate, and apoptose in the
absence of Max demonstrated for the first time that these processes can
occur via Max- and possibly Myc-independent mechanisms.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
MAX, MET1VAL

In a 46-year-old woman with bilateral malignant pheochromocytoma
(171300), Comino-Mendez et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 1A-G
transition in exon 1 of the MAX gene, resulting in a met1-to-val (M1V)
substitution in the initiation codon. Heterozygosity for the mutation
was also found in her 29-year-old brother, who had a unilateral
nonmalignant pheochromocytoma, as well as in 2 of her unaffected
children. The mutation was not found in 750 control chromosomes. Studies
of tumor tissue showed a lack of full-length MAX protein and loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) of the MAX allele, which resulted from paternal UPD
and loss of the maternal allele. The findings indicated that MAX acts as
a classic tumor suppressor gene.

.0002
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
MAX, ARG75TER

In 4 affected members of a large family with autosomal dominant
inheritance of bilateral nonmalignant pheochromocytoma (171300) with
onset between 28 and 35 years of age, Comino-Mendez et al. (2011)
identified a heterozygous 223C-T transition in exon 4 of the MAX gene,
resulting in an arg75-to-ter (R75X) substitution. One unaffected family
member also carried the mutation, which was not found in 750 control
chromosomes. Studies of tumor tissue showed a lack of full-length MAX
protein and LOH of the MAX allele, which resulted from paternal UPD and
loss of the maternal allele.

.0003
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
MAX, IVS4DS, G-A, +1

In a 32-year-old man with bilateral malignant pheochromocytoma (171300),
Comino-Mendez et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition
in intron 4 of the MAX gene (295+1G-A), resulting in a splice site
mutation and skipping of exon 4. Family history revealed a deceased
brother and niece with unilateral pheochromocytoma. The mutation was not
found in 750 control chromosomes. Studies of the tumor tissue showed a
lack of full-length MAX protein and LOH of the MAX allele, which
resulted from paternal UPD and loss of the maternal allele.

.0004
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
MAX, ARG33TER

In a young man with bilateral nonmalignant pheochromocytoma (171300),
Comino-Mendez et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 97C-T transition
in exon 3 of the MAX gene, resulting in an arg33-to-ter (R33X)
substitution. Tumor tissue showed LOH of maternal chromosome 14q.

.0005
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
MAX, 1-BP DEL, 185A

In a 47-year-old woman with bilateral nonmalignant pheochromocytoma
(171300), Comino-Mendez et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 1-bp
deletion (185delA) in exon 4 of the MAX gene, resulting in a frameshift
and premature termination. Tumor tissue showed LOH of maternal
chromosome 14q.

609787	TITLE *609787 UBIQUITIN-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; UBAP1
;;UBAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening the expression patterns of ESTs located in a region at
9p22-p21 undergoing loss of heterozygosity in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(NPC), Yang et al. (1999) identified an EST that is downregulated in
NPC. Using the clone for this EST and 5-prime RACE, Qian et al. (2001)
identified the full-length cDNA sequence, which they designated UBAP1.
The deduced 502-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular mass of 55
kD and contains 2 putative tandem UBA domains at the C terminus, a
coiled-coil domain, 2 possible N-glycosylation sites, 5 PKC
phosphorylation sites, 7 casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, and 3
N-myristoylation sites. Qian et al. (2001) also identified mouse Ubap1.
The human and mouse proteins share 90% sequence identity. Northern blot
analysis of human tissues detected ubiquitous expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript, with highest expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and
liver. RT-PCR of mouse tissues also revealed ubiquitous expression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using RT-PCR and direct sequencing, Qian et al. (2001) screened the NPC
cell line HNE1 and 10 primary NPCs for mutations in the UBAP1 gene. They
found no sequence alterations.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Qian et al. (2001) mapped the UBAP1 gene to
chromosome 9p22-p21.

612606	TITLE *612606 LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE PROTEIN 1D; LCE1D
;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 4; LEP4
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE1D,
which they called LEP4.

Using real-time PCR with primers that did not differentiate between
LCE1D and LCE1E (612607), Jackson et al. (2005) detected moderate
LCE1D/E expression in human fetal, arm, penal, and abdominal skin. Much
lower expression was detected in vulva, and little to no expression was
detected in tongue and esophagus.

GENE FUNCTION

Marshall et al. (2001) showed that Lep4 was expressed in cultured mouse
keratinocytes only after calcium induction. It was not associated with
cornified cells until 4 to 5 days after calcium induction. In situ
assays showed that Lep4 was a transglutaminase substrate and was
incorporated at the cell periphery in a calcium-dependent manner. The
incorporated protein was resistant to heat and detergent, consistent
with stable crosslinking of Lep4 into the cornified envelope.

Jackson et al. (2005) showed that expression LCE1 genes, including
LCE1D/E, was upregulated in cultured normal human keratinocytes by
ultraviolet irradiation, but not by calcium. Real-time PCR of skin
biopsies from 4 normal individuals revealed an individual who lacked
LCE1D/E almost completely. This individual did not have a major skin
defect, suggesting that loss of 1 of these genes has only minor
consequences.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that the LCE1D gene contains 2 exons.
Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE1D
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) stated that the mouse Lce1d gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene
cluster on chromosome 3F1.

614463	TITLE *614463 NMYC DOWNSTREAM-REGULATED GENE 4; NDRG4
;;SMOOTH MUSCLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 8; SMAP8;;
KIAA1180
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Hirosawa et al. (1999) cloned NDRG4. The deduced protein
contains 273 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest expression in
adult and fetal brain and adult heart, followed by lung and testis.
Lower expression was detected in other adult tissues examined, but
little to no expression was detected in fetal liver. High NDRG4
expression was detected in all specific adult brain regions examined,
with highest expression in amygdala, cerebellum, and thalamus.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to NDRG1 (605262),
followed by 3-prime and 5-prime RACE of human brain and heart cDNA
libraries and cap-site hunting, Zhou et al. (2001) cloned 3 splice
variants of NDRG4. The variants NDRG4B and NDRG4B-var, which were
obtained from the brain library, encode deduced proteins of 339 and 352
amino acids with calculated molecular masses of 37.1 and 38.5 kD,
respectively. Compared with NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var has a 14-amino acid
insertion near the C terminus. The variant NDRG4H, which was obtained
from the heart library, encodes a deduced 371-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of 40.6 kD. NDRG4H differs from NDRG4B and
NDRG4B-var at its N-terminal end, and it lacks the 14-amino acid
insertion. Northern blot analysis detected NDRG4 transcripts of about
3.2 kb in brain and heart only. Variant-specific probes showed NDRG4B
expression in brain only, whereas NDRG4H was expressed in both brain and
heart, with higher expression in heart. RT-PCR confirmed expression of
all 3 variants in brain and of NDRG4H in heart. RNA dot-blot analysis
revealed NDRG4 expression in spinal cord, all specific brain regions
examined, and all specific heart regions examined except aorta.
Expression was also detected in spleen, lymph node, testis, adrenal
gland, and fetal brain and heart, but not in other tissues examined. In
situ hybridization of normal adult brain detected NDRG4 mRNA in
cytoplasm of neurons in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, mesencephalon,
pons, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. No signal was detected in
peripheral nerves or other cell types, such as glial cells. Western blot
analysis of endogenous or exogenously expressed proteins showed that
NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var, and NDRG4H had apparent molecular masses of 37, 39,
and 41 kD, respectively.

Using expression profiling to identify genes expressed in aortic smooth
muscle, followed by screening a heart cDNA library, Nishimoto et al.
(2003) cloned NDRG4, which they called SMAP8. The deduced 371-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 40.7 kD. Northern blot
analysis detected high expression of an approximately 3.3-kb transcript
in heart and brain, with little to no expression in other tissues
examined. PCR analysis showed moderate expression in aorta and vascular
smooth muscle cells. Western blot analysis of heart and brain detected
SMAP8 at an apparent molecular mass of about 45 kD. SMAP8 localized to
the cytoplasmic fraction of transfected A10 embryonic rat aortic smooth
muscle cells.

By in situ hybridization of adult mouse brain, Yamamoto et al. (2011)
detected wide distribution of Ndrg4 in neurons, but not in astrocytes.
Western blot analysis of adult mouse brain detected 3 Ndrg4 isoforms
representing orthologs of human NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var, and NDRG4H.

GENE FUNCTION

Nishimoto et al. (2003) showed that homocysteine upregulated SMAP8
expression in primary human aortic smooth muscle cells and rat A10
cells, but not in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Proliferation
and migration of A10 cells significantly decreased following expression
of human SMAP8. SMAP8 was phosphorylated by a serine/threonine kinase
via activation of a PDGF (see 173430) signaling pathway. In addition,
ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948) and MEK1 (MAP2K1; 176872)/MEK2
(MAP2K2; 601263) were activated in SMAP8-transfected A10 cells.

Hongo et al. (2006) found that overexpression of 1 of the 6 isoforms of
rat Ndrg4, Ndrg4c2, in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells reduced NGF (see
162030)-induced phosphorylation of Elk1 (311040), a nuclear target of
Erk. Reporter gene assays revealed that Ndrg4c2 suppressed Elk1-mediated
activation of a serum response element.

By RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis, Schilling et al. (2009)
found that NDRG4 expression was increased in glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM; see 137800) compared with normal human astrocytes. Knockdown of
NDRG4 via short hairpin RNA reduced the viability of GBM cells via G1
cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis. Knockdown of NDRG4 also
reduced the viability of several GBM cell lines and primary astrocytes.
Knockdown of NDRG4 in GBM tumor xenografts reduced tumor growth
following intracranial injection in immunocompromised mice.
Overexpression of NDRG4B or NDRG4H did not affect cell viability.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhou et al. (2001) determined that the NDRG4 gene contains 17 exons and
spans 26 kb. Exons 1 and 2 are specific for NDRG4H, exon 3 is specific
for NDRG4B and NDGR4B-var, and exon 16 is specific for NDRG4B-var. The
region upstream of exon 1 contains a GGCG sequence that may represent a
TATA-less promoter for NDRG4H expression. The region upstream of exon 3
contains a consensus TATA box and 2 CCAAT sequences and may represent
the promoter for NDRG4B and NDRG4B-var expression.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhou et al. (2001) mapped the NDRG4 gene
to chromosome 16q21-q22.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yamamoto et al. (2011) found that Ndrg4 -/- mice were born at the
expected mendelian ratio, appeared normal, and were fertile. However,
Ndrg4 -/- mice showed deficits in spatial learning and memory, and they
exhibited increased sensitivity to ischemic stress following middle
cerebral artery occlusion. Consistent with these findings, Ndrg4 -/-
mice had reduced expression of the neuroprotective factor Bdnf (113505).

610276	TITLE *610276 PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL GLYCAN, CLASS X; PIGX
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) is a complex glycolipid that anchors
many proteins to the cell surface. PIGX is a subunit of a GPI
mannosyltransferase complex involved in the synthesis of the core GPI
structure in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Ashida et al., 2005).

CLONING

Ashida et al. (2005) cloned rat Pigx cDNA, which contained an unusual
CTG (leu) initiation codon. The deduced 252-amino acid protein has a
22-amino acid signal peptide, a C-terminal transmembrane region, and 2
N-glycosylation sites. Human and rat Pigx proteins share 77% sequence
identity. Pigx colocalized with an ER marker in transfected CHO cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coprecipitation experiments, Ashida et al. (2005) determined that
rat Pigx bound Pigm (610273). The expression of Pigm in CHO cells was
very low in the absence of coexpressed Pigx, suggesting that Pigx
stabilizes Pigm.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ashida et al. (2005) determined that the PIGX gene contains 6 exons and
spans 25 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ashida et al. (2005) mapped the PIGX gene
to chromosome 3q29.

FILAMIN 2; FLN2;;
ACTIN-BINDING PROTEIN 280, AUTOSOMAL FORM; ABP280A;;
ABPA;;
ACTIN-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE; ABPL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Filamins, such as FLNC, are a family of actin (see ACTA1;
102610)-binding proteins involved in reshaping of the cytoskeleton. See
FLN1 (FLNA; 300017) for background information on the filamin gene
family.

CLONING

Xie et al. (1998) cloned FLNC, which they called ABPL, from a heart cDNA
library. The deduced 2,705-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 289 kD. ABPL contains an N-terminal actin-binding domain,
followed by 24 repeats of about 94 amino acids. It has hinge sequences
prior to repeats 16 and 24. Xie et al. (1998) also identified an
alternatively spliced transcript that encodes a protein lacking hinge 1.
PCR analysis detected transcripts encoding the hinge 1-containing
isoform in stomach, uterus, umbilical vein endothelial cells, and
prostate. Transcripts encoding both isoforms were detected in heart,
thyroid, fetal brain, fetal lung, retina, spinal cord, skeletal muscle,
and bone marrow.

Using sarcoglycan-gamma (SGCG; 608896) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a skeletal muscle cDNA library, followed by EST database
analysis and screening of a skeletal muscle cDNA library, Thompson et
al. (2000) cloned FLNC, which they called FLN2. The deduced 2,688-amino
acid protein shares 74% and 71% identity with FLN1 and filamin-beta
(FLNB; 603381), respectively, and the 3 proteins are nearly 100%
identical in the actin-binding domains. FLN2 lacks the first hinge
region present in FLN1 and FLNB, but it has the second hinge region.
Like FLN1 and FLNB, FLNC has a C-terminal domain containing binding
sites for several receptor proteins. Western blot analysis detected a
280-kD protein in heart and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Thompson et al. (2000) found that
sarcoglycan-gamma and -delta (SGCD; 601411) interacted with FLN2, but
sarcoglycan-alpha (SGCA; 600119) and -beta (SGCB; 600900) did not. In
vitro binding assays indicated that FLN2 interacted directly with
sarcoglycan-gamma and -delta, but not with dystrophin (DMD; 300377) and
syntrophin beta-1 (SNTB1; 600026). Coimmunoprecipitation analysis of
transfected proteins and of endogenous proteins in mouse myotube lysates
confirmed that FLN2 interacted with sarcoglycans-gamma and -delta. Fln2
was detected predominantly in the soluble fraction of lysed mouse
myotube cultures. Immunoelectron microscopy detected 2 pools of Fln2,
one adjacent to the sarcolemmal membrane and the other more diffuse.
Thompson et al. (2000) found elevated levels of membrane-associated FLN2
in 2 patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2C (LGMD2C;
253700), a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD; 310200), and
dystrophic mice.

The KY protein (605739) has been implicated in a neuromuscular dystrophy
in the mouse, but its role in muscle function remains unclear. Beatham
et al. (2004) showed that KY interacted with several sarcomeric
cytoskeletal proteins including filamin C and the slow isoform of the
myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC1; 160794). A role for KY in regulating
filamin C function in vivo was supported by the expression analysis of
filamin C in the Ky-null mouse mutant, where distinct irregular
subcellular localization of filamin C was found in subsets of muscle
fibers, which appeared to be a specific outcome of KY deficiency. In
vitro assays showed that KY has protease activity, and specific
degradation of filamin C by KY was shown in transfected cells. Beatham
et al. (2004) suggested that KY may be an intrinsic part of the protein
networks underlying the molecular mechanism of several limb-girdle
muscular dystrophies, particularly those where interactions between
filamin C and disease-causing proteins have been shown.

MAPPING

Gariboldi et al. (1994) mapped the FLN2 gene to human chromosome
7q32-q35 by analysis of somatic cell hybrids containing portions of
chromosome 7. Chakarova et al. (2000) assigned the FLNC gene to 7q32 by
radiation hybrid analysis.

By interspecific backcross analysis, Gariboldi et al. (1994) mapped the
mouse homolog to chromosome 6 in a region showing homology of synteny to
human chromosome 7.

- Pseudogene

An FLNC pseudogene maps to chromosome 7q32-q35 about 53.7 kb downstream
from the functional FLNC gene. The pseudogene is 98% homologous to exons
46, 47, and 48 of the functional gene (van der Ven et al., 2010).

myofibrillar myopathy-5 (MFM5; 609524), Vorgerd et al. (2005) identified
a heterozygous mutation in the FLNC gene (102565.0001).

In a German mother and daughter with adult-onset limb-girdle muscle
weakness, Shatunov et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous deletion in
the FLNC gene (102565.0002). This family was the only 1 of 127 families
with a myopathy examined that was found to have an FLNC mutation,
indicating that this subtype of myofibrillar myopathy is rare.

- Distal Myopathy 4

By linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing of an
Australian family with distal myopathy-4 (MPD4; 614065), reported by
Williams et al. (2005), Duff et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous
mutation in the FLNC gene (M251T; 102565.0003). A different heterozygous
mutation (A193T; 102565.0004) was found in affected members of an
Italian family with the same phenotype. Both mutations occurred in the
actin-binding domain, and in vitro cellular expression studies showed
that both mutations resulted in increased affinity for actin.

HISTORY

Kono et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (8107delG) in
exon 48 of the FLNC gene in affected members of a Japanese family with
adult-onset myofibrillar myopathy primarily affecting the distal limbs,
with later involvement of proximal muscles. However, the paper was later
retracted by the authors after the mutation was found to occur in the
FLNC pseudogene, based on the report of van der Ven et al. (2010). Van
der Ven et al. (2010) noted that the pseudogene is 98% homologous to
exons 46, 47, and 48 of the functional FLNC gene and that the pseudogene
contains the 8107delG variant.

FLNC, TRP2710TER

In affected members of a German family with autosomal dominant
myofibrillar myopathy-5 (MFM5; 609524), Vorgerd et al. (2005) identified
a heterozygous 8130G-A transition in exon 48 of the FLNC gene, resulting
in a trp2710-to-ter (W2710X) substitution. The mutation leads to a
truncation of the filamin C immunoglobulin domain that is responsible
for dimerization. Functional expression studies showed that the W2710X
protein had improper folding, was unable to form dimers, and showed
abnormal aggregation. The findings implied that dimer formation is
essential for the biologic function of filamin. The mutation was not
identified in 220 control chromosomes.

By in vitro functional expression studies, Lowe et al. (2007) showed
that W2710X-mutant protein was less stable and more susceptible to
proteolysis compared to wildtype. The mutant protein did not dimerize
properly and formed filamin aggregates in cultured cells. Aggregation of
mutant protein did not affect dimerization of wildtype filamin C, and
the mutant protein still showed normal binding to actin and
sarcoglycans.

FLNC, 12-BP DEL, NT2997

In a German mother and daughter with autosomal dominant myofibrillar
myopathy-5 (609524), Shatunov et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous
12-bp deletion (2997_3008del) in exon 18 of the FLNC gene, predicted to
result in an in-frame deletion of 4 residues (val930 to thr933) in the
seventh repeat and confirmed by RT-PCR analysis of muscle tissue from
the affected daughter. The phenotype was characterized by adult-onset
muscle weakness initially involving proximal muscles of the lower limbs
and spreading to the upper limbs and distal muscles of lower
extremities. Both had paraspinal and abdominal muscle involvement and
winging of the scapula. Cardiac and respiratory muscles were not
affected. Skeletal muscle biopsy from the daughter showed marked
variation in fiber size, some fibers with internal nuclei, and type 1
fiber predominance. Several fibers showed polymorphous hyaline and
nonhyaline myofibrillary FLNC-positive inclusions with a convoluted,
serpentine appearance. Ultrastructural examination showed major
myofibrillar abnormalities, with accumulation of Z disc debris,
granulofilamentous material, and nemaline rods. There were also
mitochondrial aggregates.

FLNC, MET251THR

In affected members of a large Australian family with autosomal dominant
distal myopathy-4 (MPD4; 614065) originally reported by Williams et al.
(2005), Duff et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 752T-C transition
in exon 4 of the FLNC gene, resulting in a met251-to-thr (M251T)
substitution in a highly conserved residue in the CH2 domain in the
actin-binding domain. The mutation was not found in 400 control
chromosomes. The mutant protein had slightly decreased thermal stability
and showed increased actin-binding activity compared to the wildtype
protein. Transfection of the mutant M251T protein into cells showed
significantly decreased nuclear localization compared to wildtype and
resulted in the formation of intracellular protein aggregates. Duff et
al. (2011) concluded that the disease mechanism somehow involves
increased affinity for actin. The phenotype was characterized by adult
onset of distal muscle weakness and atrophy affecting the upper and
lower limbs, with nonspecific findings on muscle biopsy.

FLNC, ALA193THR

In affected members of an Italian family with autosomal dominant distal
myopathy-4 (MPD4; 614065), Duff et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous
577G-A transition in exon 2 of the FLNC gene, resulting in an
ala193-to-thr (A193T) substitution in a highly conserved residue in the
CH2 domain in the actin-binding domain. The mutation was not found in
204 control chromosomes. The mutant protein had slightly decreased
thermal stability and showed increased actin-binding activity compared
to the wildtype protein. Nuclear localization was unaltered, but
transfection resulted in the formation of intracellular protein
aggregates. Duff et al. (2011) concluded that the disease mechanism
somehow involves increased affinity for actin. The phenotype was
characterized by adult onset of distal muscle weakness and atrophy
affecting the upper and lower limbs, with nonspecific findings on muscle
biopsy.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GPCR41 (607882) and GPCR42 act as receptors for porcine endogenous
retrovirus subgroup A (PERV-A).

The water-soluble vitamin riboflavin is converted to the coenzymes
flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and
is essential for normal cellular functions. SLC52A1, or RFT1, is a
transmembrane protein that mediates cellular uptake of riboflavin
(summary by Yao et al., 2010).

CLONING

By database screening for homologs of GPCR41, Ericsson et al. (2003)
identified GPCR42, which they designated PAR2. They cloned full-length
PAR2 from a 293-cell cDNA library. The deduced 448-amino acid protein is
a putative G protein-coupled receptor and contains 10 or 11 putative
transmembrane regions similar to other gammaretrovirus receptors. PAR2
shares significant homology with PAR1 and with PAR proteins from baboon,
pig, and mouse. Northern blot analysis using a probe that did not
differentiate between PAR1 and PAR2 detected expression in all tissues
examined, with the possible exception of bladder. Highest expression was
in testis. RT-PCR detected PAR1 and PAR2 expression in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells of 11 healthy volunteers. Confocal microscopy detected
expression of fluorescence-tagged PAR2 at the plasma membrane and in the
perinuclear region of transfected rabbit corneal fibroblasts.

Using real-time PCR, Yao et al. (2010) detected highly specific RFT1
expression in placenta. Much lower expression was detected in small
intestine, thymus, and trachea, with little to none in other tissues
examined. Fluorescence-tagged RFT1 was expressed in the plasma membrane
of transfected HEK293 cells.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ericsson et al. (2003) mapped the GPR172B
gene to chromosome 17.

Hartz (2012) mapped the SLC52A1 gene to chromosome 17p13.2 based on an
alignment of the SLC52A1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK000922) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Ericsson et al. (2003) determined that expression of PAR1 or PAR2 in
transfected rabbit corneal fibroblasts and mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts
mediated both the entry and the productive replication of PERV-A.
Expression of PAR1 and PAR2 did not alter the sensitivity of the rabbit
cells to PERV-B or -C. The results suggested that PAR2 may mediate a
higher level of PERV infection than PAR1. Ericsson et al. (2003) noted
that the presence of these PERV-A receptors highlights a risk faced by
xenotransplant recipients.

Using transfected HEK293 cells, Yao et al. (2010) showed that RFT1, RFT2
(SLC52A3; 613350), and RFT3 (SLC52A2; 607882) mediated uptake of
radiolabeled riboflavin in a time- and concentration-dependent manner.
All 3 transporters also mediated riboflavin uptake independent of
extracellular Na+ and Cl-. RFT2, but not RFT1 or RFT3, showed reduced
riboflavin uptake when extracellular pH was increased from 5.4 to 8.4.
For all 3, radiolabeled riboflavin transport was completely inhibited by
excess unlabeled riboflavin and lumiflavine, and modestly inhibited by
FMN. FAD slightly but significantly inhibited RFT3-mediated riboflavin
uptake. Little to no effect was observed with other riboflavin analogs,
D-ribose, organic ions, or other vitamins.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a woman with riboflavin deficiency (RBFVD; 615026) who had an infant
with transient neonatal riboflavin deficiency (Chiong et al., 2007), Ho
et al. (2011) identified a de novo heterozygous 1.9-kb deletion within
the SLC52A1 gene (607883.0001), predicted to result in
haploinsufficiency. The infant did not carry the deletion. These
findings confirmed that the transient clinical and metabolic
abnormalities in the infant were the result of maternal riboflavin
deficiency.

SLC52A1, 1.9-KB DEL

In a woman with riboflavin deficiency (RBFVD; 615026), Ho et al. (2011)
identified a de novo heterozygous 1.9-kb deletion in the SLC52A1 gene,
resulting in the deletion of exons 2 and 3 and predicted to cause
haploinsufficiency. The woman was clinically asymptomatic, but showed
biochemical evidence of riboflavin deficiency, manifest as increased
serum acylcarnitines. She was originally ascertained (Chiong et al.,
2007) after her newborn daughter presented soon after birth with poor
suck, hypoglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. The child had dicarboxylic
aciduria and elevated plasma acylcarnitine levels, initially thought to
be consistent with multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD;
231680). Treatment with oral riboflavin resulted in complete resolution
of the clinical and biochemical findings. The findings were consistent
with transient neonatal riboflavin deficiency secondary to maternal
riboflavin deficiency that was exacerbated during pregnancy. The infant
did not carry the deletion.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a PAC library with a cDNA clone isolated from a melanoma
cell line, followed by 5-prime RACE, Chiari et al. (1999) obtained
TRAPPC1, which they called MUM2. The deduced 145-amino acid protein is
homologous to yeast Bet5. Northern blot analysis detected TRAPPC1 at 0.8
kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Chiari et al. (1999) noted that yeast Bet5 is implicated in vesicular
transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. They
found that wildtype TRAPPC1 could complement Bet5 function in yeast with
a disrupted Bet5 gene. They concluded that the function of TRAPPC1 is
conserved in eukaryotic cells and that it is involved in vesicular
transport of proteins.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chiari et al. (1999) determined that the TRAPPC1 gene contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Chiari et al. (1999) mapped the TRAPPC1
gene to chromosome 17p13.

DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

Marine et al. (1994) assigned the ZNF83 gene (also known as HPF1) to
chromosome 19 by screening a human/rodent hybrid panel and localized the
gene further to 19q13.3-q13.4 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and
digital imaging microscopy.

HISTORY

Conserved structural motifs define large families of nucleic acid
binding proteins in eukaryotes. The C2H2-type zinc finger motif,
conferring both specific RNA and DNA binding activities, was first
detected within the amino acid sequence of the Xenopus transcription
factor IIIA (Miller et al., 1985). Thereafter, vertebrate genomes were
shown to encode hundreds of so-called zinc finger proteins (ZFPs).
Subfamilies were defined on the basis of conserved sequence elements
outside the finger repeat, such as the KRAB domain. Several members of
these subfamilies were found to have a clustered genomic organization.

605515	TITLE *605515 FORKHEAD BOX P1; FOXP1
;;GLUTAMINE-RICH FACTOR 1; QRF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FOXP1 is a transcriptional repressor that plays a critical role in
monocyte differentiation and macrophage function (Shi et al., 2008).

CLONING

Li and Tucker (1993) cloned a glutamine-rich factor, which they
designated QRF1, that was expressed preferentially at the terminal
differentiation stage of B cells and in skeletal muscle. The deduced
707-amino acid QRF1 protein contains an 84-amino acid segment that shows
significant sequence homology with the DNA-binding domains of the
hepatocyte nuclear factor-3/forkhead (see FOXA1; 602294) family of
proteins.

By expression cloning using blood and testis cDNA libraries to identify
the target of a monoclonal antibody (JC12), Banham et al. (2001)
obtained a full-length cDNA encoding FOXP1. The predicted 677-amino acid
protein contains coiled-coil, glutamine-rich, and serine/threonine-rich
domains in its N-terminal half; a central zinc finger domain; and
coiled-coil, serine/threonine/proline-rich, winged helix, and acidic
domains in its C-terminal half. FOXP1 also has numerous putative
phosphorylation sites, 2 nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in its
C-terminal half, and 2 PEST motif in its C-terminal acidic region.
Multiple-tissue array analysis showed ubiquitous expression of FOXP1 in
normal adult and fetal tissues, with highest expression in lymphoid and
gastrointestinal tissues. Immunohistochemistry showed that FOXP1 protein
was widely expressed, with a predominantly nuclear localization, in
normal tissues.

Wang et al. (2003) stated that there are 4 splice variants of mouse
Foxp1, designated Foxp1a through Foxp1d. They identified and cloned
Foxp1d, which encodes a Foxp1 isoform lacking the N-terminal
polyglutamine domain found in Foxp1a and Foxp1b. Northern blot analysis
and RNase protection assays showed tissue-specific expression of all 4
variants in mouse. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected
tissue-specific expression of FOXP1 variants, with highest levels in
peripheral blood lymphocytes and in caudate nucleus of brain. Western
blot analysis detected variable expression of Foxp1a, Foxp1c, and Foxp1d
in mouse tissues, with high expression of all 3 isoforms in lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2003) found that mouse Foxp1a, Foxp1c, Foxp1d, and the
related Foxp2 (605317) protein bound a 7-nucleotide core sequence,
TATTT(G/A)T. These Foxp proteins repressed gene transcription via
binding to this consensus site, which was identified within the SV40 and
IL2 (147680) promoters. In some cases, the strength of Foxp1 repression
was mediated by the polyglutamine domain. Mouse Foxp1 proteins also
formed homodimers or heterodimers with subfamily members, and the
conserved C2H2 zinc finger and leucine zipper motifs mediated
dimerization.

Using genetic manipulations, Rousso et al. (2008) demonstrated that
Foxp1 established the pattern of LIM-homeodomain protein (see 601999)
expression in embryonic mice and, accordingly, organized motor axon
projections, their connectivity with peripheral targets, and the
establishment of motor pools. Hox proteins (see 142950) dictated the
pattern of Foxp1 expression in spinal cord, and both Foxp1 and Hox were
required for segment-appropriate generation of motor columns and pools
in mouse.

Shi et al. (2008) generated transgenic mice overexpressing human FOXP1
in monocyte/macrophage lineage cells. Circulating blood monocytes from
these mice had reduced expression of macrophage colony-stimulating
factor receptor (CSF1R; 164770), impaired migratory capacity, and
diminished accumulation as splenic macrophages. Macrophage functions
were globally impaired, and osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption were
attenuated. Forced overexpression of Csf1r reversed many of the
deficits, suggesting that repression of Csf1r is likely the dominant
mechanism responsible for FOXP1 effects on monocyte differentiation and
macrophage function.

- Association of FOXP1 With Cancer

By analysis of a tumor/normal tissue expression array, Banham et al.
(2001) found that expression of FOXP1 was lower in colon tumors and
higher in stomach and prostate tumors compared with matched normal
tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis showed frequent loss of
expression, increased expression, and cytoplasmic mislocalization of the
predominantly nuclear FOXP1 protein in solid tumors.

By immunohistochemical analysis of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (BCL)
tissue microarray, Banham et al. (2005) found that untreated patients
with a high percentage of FOXP1-positive nuclei had significantly
reduced survival and earlier progression compared with FOXP1-negative
patients.

Of 275 BCLs, Haralambieva et al. (2005) found that only 5 (3
gastrointestinal, 1 thyroid, and 1 cervical lymph node) carried a
chromosomal breakpoint in the FOXP1 gene and strong nuclear FOXP1
expression. All were diffuse large BCLs rather than marginal zone BCLs.
Haralambieva et al. (2005) concluded that genetic alterations at 3p13
are associated with strong FOXP1 expression.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Banham et al. (2001) mapped the FOXP1 gene
to chromosome 3p14.1.

CYTOGENETICS

Streubel et al. (2005) noted that 3 chromosomal translocations,
t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(14;18)(q32;q21), and t(1;14)(p22;q32), are
associated with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. They
identified a t(3;14)(p14;q32) in a case of MALT lymphoma of the thyroid.
FISH studies showed that the IGH locus (147100) was rearranged, and
long-distance inverse PCR identified FOXP1 as the partner gene on
chromosome 3. Using FISH assays to screen 91 MALT lymphomas negative for
3 common translocations, Streubel et al. (2005) identified
t(3;14)(p14;q32) in 9 cases (3 thyroid, 4 ocular adnexa, and 2 skin).
Most t(3;14)(p14;q32)-positive MALT lymphomas also harbored additional
genetic abnormalities, such as trisomy 3. All 4 of the MALT-associated
translocations were mutually exclusive. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed
upregulated expression of FOXP1 in MALT cases with t(3;14)(p14;q32) or
trisomy 3. Streubel et al. (2005) concluded that FOXP1 is a
translocation partner of IGH in a site-dependent subset of MALT
lymphomas.

Carr et al. (2010) reported a boy with severe speech delay and delayed
motor development (see 613670) who carried a de novo heterozygous 1.0-Mb
interstitial deletion of chromosome 3p14.1 that involved only the FOXP1
gene. The phenotype was confounded by a Chiari I malformation, which was
surgically corrected at age 30 months. The patient had delayed gross
motor skills and walked at 16 months. After surgery for the Chiari
malformation, he had some improvement in motor skills. The most
significant feature was speech delay with limited verbal output and
difficulty in articulating entire words and multisyllabic speech,
although he did not have a deficit in oromotor coordination. At age 4
years, he developed staring spells with motor arrest associated with
epileptiform discharges. He had mild dysmorphic facial features,
including broad forehead, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral
fissures, ptosis, short nose, broad nasal tip, and smooth philtrum. Carr
et al. (2010) concluded that FOXP1 may play a role in the development of
verbal and motor skills.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hamdan et al. (2010) identified 2 different de novo heterozygous
mutations in the FOXP1 gene (605515.0001 and 605515.0002, respectively)
in 2 unrelated children of French Canadian origin with moderate mental
retardation, expressive language deficits, and autistic features
(613670). The first mutation (605515.0001) was a small deletion found
using array-based comparative genomic hybridization of a cohort of 80
patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 30 with intellectual
disability. The second mutation (R525X; 605515.0002) was found by direct
sequencing of the FOXP1 gene in a cohort of 110 patients with
intellectual disability, 84 with ASD, and 51 with both. Hamdan et al.
(2010) chose to examine the FOXP1 gene specifically because of the role
of the FOXP2 gene (605317) in a speech and language disorder (SPCH1;
602081); patients with intellectual disability and ASD often show
language impairment. The results indicated that disruption of FOXP1 has
a global impact on brain development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hu et al. (2006) found that mice lacking Foxp1 died at embryonic day
14.5 due to heart valve and outflow tract abnormalities. Reconstitution
of Rag2 (179616)-deficient mice with Foxp1 -/- or Foxp1 +/- fetal liver
cells resulted in decreased mature B cells, but normal thymocytes, in
the recipients. Foxp1 -/- pro-B cells had reduced IgM, Rag1 (179615),
and Rag2 expression, and V(D)J rearrangement was also impaired in Foxp1
-/- B cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and EMSA analyses showed that
Foxp1 bound to Foxp site-2 (Fkh2) in the Erag enhancer, which is
upstream of Rag2, in a B-lineage specific way. Hu et al. (2006)
concluded that FOXP1 influences B-cell development at an early stage,
and that FOXP1 deficiency results in a phenotype that resembles double
haploinsufficiency of E2A (TCF3; 147141) and EBF (164343).

Feng et al. (2010) generated mice with a conditional deletion of Foxp1
in double-positive thymocytes and found that peripheral Cd4 (see 186940)
and Cd8 (see 186910) cells also lacked Foxp1 and that single-positive
thymocytes acquired an activated phenotype in thymus. Peripheral cells
also exhibited an activated phenotype and increased apoptosis and
readily produced cytokines upon T-cell receptor engagement. Feng et al.
(2010) concluded that FOXP1 is an essential transcriptional regulator
for thymocyte development and the generation of quiescent naive T cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION WITH LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT AND AUTISTIC FEATURES
FOXP1, 390-KB DEL

In a French Canadian girl who had mental retardation with language
impairment and autistic features (613670), Hamdan et al. (2010)
identified a de novo heterozygous 390-kb intragenic deletion in the
FOXP1 gene. The deletion encompassed exons 4 to 14 of the longest FOXP1
isoform, including the translation initiation site and leucine zipper
and zinc finger domains important for transcriptional activity.

.0002
MENTAL RETARDATION WITH LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT AND AUTISTIC FEATURES
FOXP1, ARG525TER

In a French Canadian boy who had mental retardation with language
impairment and autistic features (613670), Hamdan et al. (2010)
identified a de novo heterozygous 1573C-T transition in the FOXP1 gene,
resulting in an arg525-to-ter (R525X) substitution. The mutation was
predicted to abolish the last 152 residues of the protein, including
part of the forkhead DNA-binding (FHD) domain and a conserved nuclear
localization signal. The mutation was not found in 570 controls. In
vitro functional expression studies in HEK293 cells showed that the
R525X mutant impaired the transcriptional repression ability of FOXP1,
consistent with a loss of function.

610328	TITLE *610328 RUN AND FYVE DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; RUFY2
;;KIAA1537
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned RUFY2, which they designated
KIAA1537. RT-PCR ELISA detected variable expression in all adult and
fetal tissues examined. Highest expression was in ovary, whole adult
brain, and testis, and lowest expression was in pancreas, spleen, fetal
liver, and fetal whole brain. RUFY2 was expressed in all specific adult
brain regions examined, with highest expression in amygdala.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to RUFY1 (610327),
followed by screening prostate cancer and neuroblastoma cDNA libraries,
Yang et al. (2002) cloned RUFY2. The deduced 606-amino acid protein has
an N-terminal RUN domain, 2 central coiled-coil domains, and a
C-terminal FYVE domain containing 2 zinc-binding sites and an SH3 domain
recognition motif (PxxPxP). Northern blot analysis detected RUFY2
expression in brain, lung, and testis only.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Yang et al. (2002) demonstrated that
RUFY2 directly interacted with ETK (EPHA3; 179611) following their
coexpression in a mouse myoblast cell line.

Majercak et al. (2006) showed that expression of RUFY2 reduced secretion
of beta-amyloid from human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing APP
(104760). The RUFY2 gene maps to a region of chromosome 10q that has
been linked to both late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD6; 605526) and
elevated plasma levels of pathogenic beta-amyloid.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RUFY2
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP WI-11265). By genomic sequence analysis,
Majercak et al. (2006) mapped the RUFY2 gene to chromosome 10q21.

604472	TITLE *604472 TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR LIGAND SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 13; TNFSF13
;;APRIL;;
TNF- AND APOL-RELATED LEUKOCYTE EXPRESSED LIGAND 2; TALL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of ligands play
important roles in various physiologic and pathologic processes,
including cell proliferation, differentiation, and death, and modulation
of immune responses. By screening EST databases, Hahne et al. (1998)
cloned a novel TNF cDNA, TNFSF13, which they called APRIL, for 'a
proliferation-inducing ligand.' The full-length cDNA TNFSF13 clone
encodes a 250-amino acid protein with a predicted 28-amino acid
cytoplasmic domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and an
extracellular domain of 201 amino acids with no signal peptide. There is
only 1 N-linked glycosylation site. The sequence of the extracellular
domain shows 21% homology with TNFSF6 (134638) and 20% homology with
TNFA (191160). Northern blot analysis revealed weak expression
restricted to a few tissues: transcripts of 2.1 and 2.4 kb in prostate
and a transcript of 1.8 kb in peripheral blood leukocytes. All tumor
cell lines, however, strongly expressed the TNFSF13 2.1-kb transcript,
and expression of extracellular or full-length TNFSF13 led to increased
proliferation of various cell lines.

Shu et al. (1999) identified the same gene, which they designated TALL2.
TALL2 shares about 35% sequence identity with TALL1 (BLYS, or TNFSF13B;
603969) in the C terminus.

By RACE, RT-PCR, and screening of a T-cell cDNA library, Pradet-Balade
et al. (2002) isolated a hybrid transcript formed by intergenic splicing
of exons 1 through 6 of TWEAK (TNFSF12; 602695) to exons 2 through 6 of
APRIL. See 602695 for further information on the protein encoded by the
TWEAK/APRIL transcript, which Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) called
TWEPRIL.

Using Northern blot analysis, Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) found that
relative expression of the 1.9-kb APRIL transcript was about 6-fold
higher than that of the 2.5-kb TWEPRIL transcript in resting T cells.
However, in activated T cells, both transcripts were expressed at
similar levels. A similar expression pattern for APRIL and TWEPRIL was
detected in CD4 (186940)-positive and CD8 (see 186910)-positive T-cell
subpopulations. TWEAK expression was similar between resting and
activated T cells. TWEAK was found predominantly in ribosome-free
fractions in both resting and activated T cells, whereas APRIL and
TWEPRIL increased their association with polyribosomes following T-cell
activation, suggesting that translational efficiency of APRIL and
TWEPRIL increases upon T-cell activation.

GENE FUNCTION

Seyler et al. (2005) analyzed synovial tissue specimens from 72 patients
with rheumatoid arthritis (180300) for TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B production
and TNFSF13/TNFSF13B receptor expression. Synovitis with ectopic
germinal centers present had the highest levels of TNFSF13, produced
exclusively by CD83 (604534)-positive dendritic cells; TNFSF13B was
present in similar levels in all types of synovitis (with or without
germinal centers or T cell-B cell aggregates) and was produced
exclusively from CD68 (153634)-positive macrophages. In synovitis with
germinal centers, inhibiting TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B with a TACI
(TNFRSF13B; 604907):Fc fusion protein resulted in destruction of the
germinal centers and marked inhibition of IFN-gamma (147570) and Ig
transcription, whereas similar inhibition in the aggregate and diffuse
types of synovitis enhanced IFN-gamma production and did not affect Ig
levels. These differential immunomodulatory effects correlated with the
presence of TACI-positive T cells in aggregate and diffuse synovitis and
their absence in synovitis with germinal centers. Seyler et al. (2005)
proposed that TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B regulate B-cell as well as T-cell
function and have both pro- and antiinflammatory effects in rheumatoid
arthritis.

Both BLYS and APRIL have been described as homotrimeric molecules, a
feature common to many members of the TNF superfamily. Using ELISA
analysis, Roschke et al. (2002) found that patients with systemic lupus
erythematosus (152700), rheumatoid arthritis, Reiter syndrome, psoriatic
arthritis (see 607507), polymyositis (see 160750), and ankylosing
spondylitis (106300) had significantly higher levels of BLYS/APRIL
heterotrimers than did controls. Roschke et al. (2002) proposed that
BLYS/APRIL heterotrimers may play a role in rheumatic and other
autoimmune diseases, and that other members of the TNF ligand
superfamily may also form active soluble heterotrimers.

Using cell-based, biochemical, and structural studies, Hymowitz et al.
(2005) characterized interactions between APRIL and TACI. They found
that the short isoform of human TACI, which lacks cysteine-rich domain-1
(CRD1), was still functional for signaling and that CRD2 of TACI was
sufficient for high-affinity binding to either murine April or human
BAFF (TNFSF13B). The solution structure of CRD2 of TACI revealed a
compact domain and additional ligand-binding determinants. Cocrystal
structures of murine April bound to CRD2 of human TACI or to human BCMA
(TNFRSF17; 109545) showed large interfaces and revealed key differences
that likely influence ligand-binding affinity and specificity.

Ingold et al. (2005) showed that the TNF homology domain of mouse and
human APRIL bound BCMA and TACI, whereas a basic sequence (QKQKKQ) close
to the N terminus of the mature protein bound negatively charged
sulfated glycosaminoglycan side chains of proteoglycans. Although T-cell
lines bound little APRIL, ectopic expression of glycosaminoglycan-rich
syndecans (see SDC1; 186355) or glypicans (see GPC1; 600395) conferred
on these cells a high binding capacity that was completely dependent on
the N-terminal basic sequence of APRIL. Moreover, SDC1-positive plasma
cells and proteoglycan-rich nonhematopoietic cells displayed high
specific, heparin-sensitive binding to APRIL. Inhibition of BAFF and
APRIL, but not BAFF alone, prevented survival and/or migration of newly
formed plasma cells to bone marrow. In addition, costimulation of B-cell
proliferation by APRIL was only effective upon APRIL oligomerization.
Ingold et al. (2005) proposed that APRIL binding to the extracellular
matrix or to proteoglycan-positive cells induces APRIL oligomerization,
which is the prerequisite for triggering TACI- and/or BCMA-mediated
activation, migration, and survival signals.

Using flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and immunohistochemical
analysis, Huard et al. (2008) found that APRIL was expressed on
recruited neutrophils and accumulated on subepithelial heparan sulfate
proteoglycans in upper (e.g., tonsils) and lower (e.g., lamina propria)
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and contributed to survival of
plasma cells. Mice lacking April had less-persistent mucosal humoral
immunity. Huard et al. (2008) proposed that inflammation-recruited
neutrophils may create plasma cell niches in MALT to sustain local
antibody production.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the TNFSF13 gene contains 6
exons.

MAPPING

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the transcriptional start
site of the TNFSF13 gene lies 878 bp downstream of the TNFSF12 gene on
chromosome 17p13.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

By treating mice with TACI-Ig, Gross et al. (2001) determined that BLYS
and APRIL are required for the development of both transitional (T2) and
mature B lymphocytes. TACI-Ig-treated mice also had less circulating
immunoglobulin and produced less collagen-specific antibody. TACI-Ig
treatment inhibited the development of collagen-induced rheumatoid
arthritis. Gross et al. (2001) proposed that TACI-Ig may have a role in
both the prevention and treatment of autoimmune disease mediated by
pathogenic autoantibodies.

Stein et al. (2002) created mice expressing human APRIL as a transgene
in T cells. These mice appeared normal. Transgenic T cells showed
enhanced survival in vitro and enhanced survival of staphylococcal
enterotoxin B-reactive Cd4-positive T cells in vivo, and both of these
responses correlated with elevated Bcl2 levels. Analysis of humoral
responses to T cell-dependent antigens in the transgenic mice indicated
that APRIL affected IgM responses, but not IgG responses. In contrast, T
cell-independent type-2 (TI-2) humoral responses were enhanced in APRIL
transgenic mice. As TACI had been reported to be indispensable for TI-2
antibody formation, Stein et al. (2002) concluded that APRIL-TACI
interactions have a role in generating the TI-2 response and that APRIL
is involved in the induction and/or maintenance of T- and B-cell
responses.

To investigate the role of APRIL in immunity, Castigli et al. (2004)
generated April-deficient mice. April -/- mice had normal T and B
lymphocyte development, normal T and B cell proliferation in vitro, but
increased numbers of CD4+ effector/memory T cells and increased IgG
responses to T-dependent antigens. Serum IgA levels were significantly
decreased, and serum IgA antibody responses to mucosal immunization with
T-dependent antigens and to type 1 T-independent antigens were impaired
in April -/- mice. The results suggested that APRIL downregulates T
cell-dependent antibody responses and promotes IgA class switching.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The nucleosome is the basic repeat unit of eukaryotic chromatin. The
nucleosome core particle consists of an octamer formed by 2 each of the
core histones H2A (see 613499), H2B (see 609904), H3 (see 602810), and
H4, around which DNA is wrapped. A fifth histone, histone H1 (see
142709), is bound to the linker DNA between nucleosomes and is important
for the higher order structure of chromatin. HIST1H4A is a core histone
H4 (summary by Marzluff et al. (2002) and Foster and Downs (2005)).

GENE FAMILY

All core histones, including H4 histones, contain a histone fold domain,
which is central to the nucleosome core structure, and a flexible
N-terminal domain that protrudes from the nucleosome core particle. Like
other histones, H4 histones can be subgrouped according to their
temporal expression. Replication-dependent histones, such as HIST1H4A
through HIST1H4L (602831) and HIST2H4A (142750) are mainly expressed
during S phase. In contrast, replication-independent histones, or
replacement variant histones, can be expressed throughout the cell
cycle. Most replication-dependent H4 histone genes, as well as other
core histone genes, are located within histone gene cluster-1 (HIST1) on
chromosome 6p22-p21. Two other histone gene clusters, HIST2 and HIST3,
are located on chromosomes 1q21 and 1q42, respectively. HIST2 contains 1
replication-dependent H4 gene, HIST2H4A, and there are no H4 genes in
HIST3. An additional H4 gene, HIST4H4 (615069), is located on chromosome
12p13.1. In mouse, the Hist1, Hist2, and Hist3 gene clusters are located
on chromosomes 13A2-A3, 3F1-F2, and 11B2, respectively. All
replication-dependent histone genes are intronless, and they encode
mRNAs that lack a poly(A) tail, ending instead in a conserved stem-loop
sequence. Unlike replication-dependent histone genes,
replication-independent histone genes are solitary genes that are
located on chromosomes apart from any other H1 or core histone genes.
Some replication-independent histone genes contain introns and encode
mRNAs with poly(A) tails. All human and mouse H4 histone genes encode
the same protein (summary by Marzluff et al. (2002) and Foster and Downs
(2005)).

CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marzluff et al. (2002) identified the
mouse and human HIST1H4A genes. All mouse and human H4 genes, including
HIST1H4A, encode the same protein.

MAPPING

By analysis of a YAC contig from chromosome 6p21.3, Albig et al. (1997)
characterized a cluster of 35 histone genes, including H4/a.

By genomic sequence analysis, Marzluff et al. (2002) determined that the
HIST1 cluster on chromosome 6p22-p21 contains 55 histone genes,
including 12 H4 genes. The HIST1H4A gene is the most telomeric H4 gene
within the HIST1 cluster. The HIST1 cluster spans over 2 Mb and includes
2 large gaps (over 250 kb each) where there are no histone genes, but
many other genes. The organization of histone genes in the mouse Hist1
cluster on chromosome 13A2-A3 is essentially identical to that in human
HIST1. The HIST2 cluster on chromosome 1q21 contains 6 histone genes,
including 1 H4 gene (HIST2H4A; 142750), and the HIST3 cluster on
chromosome 1q42 contains 3 histone genes, but no H4 genes. Hist2 and
Hist3 are located on mouse chromosomes 3F1-F2 and 11B2, respectively. An
additional H4 gene, HIST4H4 (615069), is located on human chromosome
12p13.1 and mouse chromosome 6G1.

GENE FUNCTION

- H4 Histone Family

As reviewed by Felsenfeld (1992), detailed biochemical definition of the
protein complexes that regulate gene transcription led to reemergence of
questions concerning the role of histones. He reviewed evidence
suggesting that transcriptional activation requires that transcription
factors successfully compete with histones for binding to promoters.

CpG island hypermethylation and global genomic hypomethylation are
common epigenetic features of cancer cells. Fraga et al. (2005)
characterized posttranslational modifications to histone H4 in a
comprehensive panel of normal tissues, cancer cell lines, and primary
tumors. They found that cancer cells had a loss of monoacetylated and
trimethylated forms of histone H4. These changes appeared early and
accumulated during the tumorigenic process, as they showed in a mouse
model of multistage skin carcinogenesis. The losses occurred
predominantly at the acetylated lys16 and trimethylated lys20 residues
of histone H4 and were associated with the hypomethylation of DNA
repetitive sequences, a well-known characteristic of cancer cells. Fraga
et al. (2005) suggested that the global loss of monoacetylation and
trimethylation of histone H4 is a common hallmark of human tumor cells.

Wang et al. (2001) reported the purification, molecular identification,
and functional characterization of a histone H4-specific
methyltransferase, PRMT1 (602950), a protein arginine methyltransferase.
PRMT1 specifically methylates arginine-3 of histone H4 in vitro and in
vivo. Methylation of arg3 by PRMT1 facilitates subsequent acetylation of
H4 tails by p300 (602700). However, acetylation of H4 inhibits its
methylation by PRMT1. Most important, a mutation in the
S-adenosyl-L-methionine-binding site of PRMT1 substantially crippled its
nuclear receptor coactivator activity. Wang et al. (2001) concluded that
their findings reveal arg3 of H4 as a novel methylation site by PRMT1
and indicate that arg3 methylation plays an important role in
transcriptional regulation.

Agalioti et al. (2002) found that only a small subset of lysines in
histones H3 (see 602810) and H4 are acetylated in vivo by the GCN5
acetyltransferase (see 602301) during activation of the interferon-beta
gene (IFNB; 147640). Reconstitution of recombinant nucleosomes bearing
mutations in these lysine residues revealed the cascade of gene
activation via a point-by-point interpretation of the histone code
through the ordered recruitment of bromodomain-containing transcription
complexes. Acetylation of histone H4 lys8 mediates recruitment of the
SWI/SNF complex (see 603111), whereas acetylation of lys9 and lys14 in
histone H3 is critical for the recruitment of TFIID (see 313650). Thus,
the information contained in the DNA address of the enhancer is
transferred to the histone N termini by generating novel adhesive
surfaces required for the recruitment of transcription complexes.

Using deuterium exchange/mass spectrometry coupled with hydrodynamic
measures, Black et al. (2004) demonstrated that CENPA (117139) and
histone H4 form subnucleosomal tetramers that are more compact and
conformationally more rigid than the corresponding tetramers of histones
H3 and H4. Substitution into histone H3 of the domain of CENPA
responsible for compaction was sufficient to direct it to centromeres.
Thus, Black et al. (2004) concluded that the centromere-targeting domain
of CENPA confers a unique structural rigidity to the nucleosomes into
which it assembles, and is likely to have a role in maintaining
centromere identity.

Acetylation of histone H4 on lysine-16 (H4-K16Ac) is a prevalent and
reversible posttranslational chromatin modification in eukaryotes. To
characterize the structural and functional role of this mark,
Shogren-Knaak et al. (2006) used a native chemical ligation strategy to
generate histone H4 that was homogeneously acetylated at K16. The
incorporation of this modified histone into nucleosomal arrays inhibited
the formation of compact 30-nanometer-like fibers and impeded the
ability of chromatin to form cross-fiber interactions. H4-K16Ac also
inhibited the ability of the adenosine triphosphate-utilizing chromatin
assembly and remodeling enzyme ACF to mobilize a mononucleosome,
indicating that this single histone modification modulates both higher
order chromatin structure and functional interactions between a
nonhistone protein and the chromatin fiber.

In a screen for endogenous tumor-associated T-cell responses in a
primary mouse model of prostatic adenocarcinoma, Savage et al. (2008)
identified a naturally arising CD8+ T cell response that is reactive to
a peptide derived from histone H4. Despite the ubiquitous nature of
histones, T cell recognition of histone H4 peptide was specifically
associated with the presence of prostate cancer in these mice. Thus,
Savage et al. (2008) concluded that the repertoire of antigens
recognized by tumor-infiltrating T cells is broader than previously
thought and includes peptides derived from ubiquitous self antigens that
are normally sequestered from immune detection.

Dang et al. (2009) reported an age-associated decrease in yeast Sir2
(see SIRT1, 604479) protein abundance accompanied by an increase in
histone H4 lysine-16 acetylation and loss of histones at specific
subtelomeric regions in replicatively old yeast cells, which results in
compromised transcriptional silencing at these loci. Antagonizing
activities of Sir2 and Sas2, a histone acetyltransferase, regulate the
replicative life span through histone H4 lys16 at subtelomeric regions.
Dang et al. (2009) concluded that this pathway, distinct from existing
aging models for yeast, may represent an evolutionarily conserved
function of sirtuins in regulation of replicative aging by maintenance
of intact telomeric chromatin.

Xu et al. (2010) reported that significant amounts of histone H3.3 (see
601128)-H4 tetramers split in vivo, whereas most H3.1 (see 602810)-H4
tetramers remain intact during mitotic division. Inhibiting DNA
replication-dependent deposition greatly reduced the level of splitting
events, which suggested that (i) the replication-independent H3.3
deposition pathway proceeds largely by cooperatively incorporating 2 new
H3.3-H4 dimers, and (ii) the majority of splitting events occurred
during replication-dependent deposition. Xu et al. (2010) concluded that
'silent' histone modifications within large heterochromatic regions are
maintained by copying modifications from neighboring preexisting
histones without the need for H3-H4 splitting events.

Qi et al. (2010) provided multiple lines of evidence establishing PHF8
(300560) as the first monomethyl histone H4 lysine-20 (H4K20me1)
demethylase, with additional activities towards histone H3K9me1 and me2.
PHF8 is located around the transcriptional start sites of approximately
7,000 RefSeq genes and in gene bodies and intergenic regions. PHF8
depletion resulted in upregulation of H4K20me1 and H3K9me1 at the
transcriptional start site and H3K9me2 in the nontranscriptional start
sites, respectively, demonstrating differential substrate specificities
at different target locations. PHF8 positively regulates gene
expression, which is dependent on its H3K4me3-binding PHD and catalytic
domains. Importantly, patient mutations significantly compromised PHF8
catalytic function. PHF8 regulates cell survival in the zebrafish brain
and jaw development, thus providing a potentially relevant biologic
context for understanding the clinical symptoms associated with PHF8
patients. Lastly, genetic and molecular evidence supported a model
whereby PHF8 regulates zebrafish neuronal cell survival and jaw
development in part by directly regulating the expression of the
homeodomain transcription factor MSX1/MSXB (605558), which functions
downstream of multiple signaling and developmental pathways.

Liu et al. (2010) reported that PHF8, while using multiple substrates,
including H3K9me1/2 and H3K27me2, also functions as an H4K20me1
demethylase. PHF8 is recruited to promoters by its PHD domain based on
interaction with H3K4me2/3 and controls G1-S transition in conjunction
with E2F1, HCF1 (300019), and SET1A (611052), at least in part, by
removing the repressive H4K20me1 mark from a subset of E2F1-regulated
gene promoters. Phosphorylation-dependent PHF8 dismissal from chromatin
in prophase is apparently required for the accumulation of H4K20me1
during early mitosis, which might represent a component of the condensin
II loading process. Accordingly, the HEAT repeat clusters in 2
non-structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) condensin II subunits,
NCAPD3 (609276) and NCAPG2 (608532), are capable of recognizing
H4K20me1, and ChIP-Seq analysis demonstrated a significant overlap of
condensin II and H4K20me1 sites in mitotic HeLa cells. Thus, Liu et al.
(2010) concluded that the identification and characterization of an
H4K20me1 demethylase, PHF8, has revealed an intimate link between this
enzyme and 2 distinct events in cell cycle progression.

Fullgrabe et al. (2013) reported that induction of autophagy is coupled
to reduction of histone H4 lysine-16 acetylation (H4K16ac) through
downregulation of the histone acetyltransferase MOF (MYST1; 609912), and
demonstrated that this histone modification regulates the outcome of
autophagy. At a genomewide level, Fullgrabe et al. (2013) found that
H4K16 deactylation is associated predominantly with the downregulation
of autophagy-related genes. Antagonizing H4K16ac downregulation upon
autophagy induction results in the promotion of cell death. Fullgrabe et
al. (2013) concluded that their findings established that alteration in
a specific histone posttranslational modification during autophagy
affects the transcriptional regulation of autophagy-related genes and
initiates a regulatory feedback loop, which serves as a key determinant
of survival versus death responses upon autophagy induction.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Sekulic et al. (2010) reported the crystal structure of a subnucleosomal
heterotetramer, (CENP-A-H4)2 (CENP-A, 117139, in complex with histone
H4), that reveals 3 distinguishing properties encoded by the residues
that comprise the CENP-A targeting domain (CATD): (1) a CENP-A-CENP-A
interface that is substantially rotated relative to the H3-H3 interface;
(2) a protruding loop L1 of the opposite charge as that on H3; and (3)
strong hydrophobic contacts that rigidify the CENP-A-H4 interface.
Residues involved in the CENP-A-CENP-A rotation are required for
efficient incorporation into centromeric chromatin, indicating
specificity for an unconventional nucleosome shape. DNA topologic
analysis indicated that CENP-A-containing nucleosomes are octameric with
conventional left-handed DNA wrapping. Sekulic et al. (2010) concluded
that CENP-A marks centromere location by restructuring the nucleosome
from within its folded histone core.

Elsasser et al. (2012) reported the crystal structures of the DAXX
(603186) histone-binding domain with a histone H3.3-H4 dimer, including
mutants within DAXX and H3.3, together with in vitro and in vivo
functional studies that elucidated the principles underlying H3.3
recognition specificity. Occupying 40% of the histone surface-accessible
area, DAXX wraps around the H3.3-H4 dimer, with complex formation
accompanied by structural transitions in the H3.3-H4 histone fold. DAXX
uses an extended alpha-helical conformation to compete with major
interhistone, DNA, and ASF1 interaction sites. Elsasser et al. (2012)
concluded that their structural studies identified recognition elements
that read out H3.3-specific residues, and functional studies addressed
the contribution of gly90 in H3.3 and glu225 in DAXX to
chaperone-mediated H3.3 variant recognition specificity.

EVOLUTION

Histone IV genes are highly conserved across evolution. Delange and
Smith (1971) noted that, in their 110 amino acids, histone IV genes of
cattle and garden peas differ by only 2 residues.

Heintz et al. (1981) concluded that the human histone genes are
clustered in the genome but are not arranged into recognizable repeating
units. The lack of organization of the human histone genes (as
contrasted with those of invertebrates or of Xenopus laevis) may reflect
the diminished requirement for rapid synthesis of large quantities of
histone proteins during early mammalian development.

Kedes and Maxson (1981) found that the histone genes in man, mouse,
chicken, and toad show a dispersed topology; they are scattered and
separated by long stretches of nonhistone DNA. In an article subtitled
'Paradigm Lost,' the authors referred to 'this newly discovered
diaspora.'

NOMENCLATURE

Marzluff et al. (2002) provided a nomenclature for replication-dependent
histone genes located within the HIST1, HIST2, and HIST3 clusters. The
symbols for these genes all begin with HIST1, HIST2, or HIST3 according
to which cluster they are located in. The H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 genes
were named systematically according to their location within the HIST1,
HIST2, and HIST3 clusters. For example, HIST1H4A is the most telomeric
H4 gene within HIST1, and HIST1H4L (602831) is the most centromeric. In
contrast, the H1 genes, all of which are located within HIST1, were
named according to their mouse homologs. Thus, HIST1H1A (142709) is
homologous to mouse H1a, HIST1H1B (142711) is homologous to mouse H1b,
and so on.

HISTORY

Szabo et al. (1978) presented nucleic acid hybridization data indicating
that chromosome 7 carries gene(s) coding for histone H4 protein.
Steffensen (1979) presented evidence that all 5 histone genes in man are
clustered at 7q2. Yunis and Chandler (1979) located the histone genes to
bands 7q32-36 and the homologous chromosome segments in chimpanzee,
gorilla, and orangutan.

A clone containing a human histone gene cluster in the order
H3-H4-H1-H2A-H2B was isolated by Clark et al. (1981), as cited by
Hentschel and Birnstiel (1981). Sierra et al. (1982) likewise found an
arrangement of the histone genes different from that in the sea urchin
and Drosophila.

Carozzi et al. (1984) isolated an H1 histone gene from a 15-kb human DNA
genomic sequence. The presence of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 genes in this same
15-kb fragment demonstrated that these genes are clustered.

By study of mouse-human cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization, Green
et al. (1984) showed that H3 and H4 histone genes are on 1q, probably
1q21. From in situ hybridization, Tripputi et al. (1986) concluded that
histone genes map to at least 3 different chromosomes: 1, 6, and 12.
Some may be nonexpressed pseudogenes. They commented that the number of
histone genes is between 100 and 200. The histones have the distinction
of being the only proteins coded by repetitive DNA. Tanguay et al.
(1987) reported in situ hybridization data corroborating those of
Tripputi et al. (1986), using a heterologous probe containing the 5
histone genes of Drosophila. They found that the main concentrations of
grains were at 6p12-q21, 12q11-q22, and 1cen-q25. Allen et al. (1989)
reported the conflicting assignment of histones 3 and 4 to human
chromosome 6.

606839	TITLE *606839 CADHERIN-RELATED FAMILY, MEMBER 5; CDHR5
;;MUCIN AND CADHERIN-LIKE; MUCDHL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Paris and Williams (2000) identified several genes, including CDHR5,
which they called MUCDHL, by constructing a physical map of chromosome
11p15.5. They found that MUCDHL contains nonpolymorphic tandem repeats
similar to mucin proteins and a consensus calcium-binding motif found in
all cadherins.

MAPPING

Paris and Williams (2000) constructed a physical map of chromosome
11p15.5 and located the CDHR5 gene less than 250 kb telomeric to a mucin
gene cluster.
