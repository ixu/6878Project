;;CD39-LIKE 4; CD39L4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nucleoside triphosphatases (NTPases) are divalent cation-dependent
transmembrane glycoproteins that hydrolyze extracellular nucleoside tri-
and/or diphosphates. NTPases are characterized by the presence of 4
motifs known as apyrase-conserved regions (ACRs). Chadwick et al. (1998)
identified cDNAs encoding a mouse NTPase, which they symbolized MNTPase.
By searching an EST database for sequences similar to that of MNTPase,
Chadwick and Frischauf (1998) identified cDNAs corresponding to 2 human
genes, CD39L2 (603160) and CD39L4. The coding regions of the mouse and
human CD39L4 genes share 88% nucleotide sequence identity. The predicted
428-amino acid CD39L4 protein contains all 4 ACRs, a single N-terminal
transmembrane segment, and a large extracellular C-terminal domain.
Northern blot analysis revealed that CD39L4 was expressed as a 4.8-kb
mRNA in all tissues tested. Several smaller bands were also observed in
tissues with the strongest CD39L4 expression.

Fang et al. (2010) showed that fluorescence-tagged Entpd5 localized with
an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker in mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEFs).

GENE FUNCTION

By PCR analysis of cDNA libraries, Mulero et al. (1999) detected CD39L4
only in macrophages. Functional and Western blot analysis determined
that the ADPase and nucleotide disphosphatase activity of the secreted
51-kD protein is enhanced by the presence of divalent cations.
Glycosidase or tunicamycin treatment (Mulero et al., 2000) reduced the
size of the protein to the predicted 46 kD and reduced the amount
secreted as well; unlike CD39L3 (603161), however, it did not impair
enzymatic activity.

Fang et al. (2010) showed that in vitro-translated ENTPD5 hydrolyzed UDP
and GDP, but not other nucleotides. Deletion of Pten (601728) in MEFs
results in activation of the PI3 kinase (see 601232)/Akt (see 164730)
pathway, which promotes cell growth and survival, with a concomitant
increase in protein translation. Fang et al. (2010) showed that Entpd5
expression and ATP hydrolysis were significantly elevated in Pten -/-
MEFs. Mass spectrometric analysis identified ENTPD5, UMP/CMP kinase-1
(CMPK1; 191710), and adenylate kinase-1 (AK1; 103000) as components of
an ATP hydrolysis cycle in HeLa cells. Within this cycle, ENTPD5
provided the critical UMP or GMP cofactors for hydrolysis of ATP to AMP,
and lack of any of the 3 enzymes compromised ATP hydrolysis. Knockdown
of Entpd5 in Pten -/- MEFs increased expression of markers of ER stress,
reduced protein N-glycosylation, and reduced lactate production. Western
blot, immunohistochemical, and microarray analyses showed that
upregulation of ENTPD5 correlated with AKT activation in human prostate
cancer cell lines and primary prostate tumor samples. Knockdown of
ENTPD5 in LNCaP prostate cancer cells reduced tumor growth in nude mice.
Fang et al. (2010) concluded that ENTPD5 has a critical role in
N-glycosylation and contributes to the Warburg effect, i.e., elevated
lactate production under aerobic conditions, in tumor cells.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and linkage analysis, Chadwick et
al. (1998) mapped the MNTPase gene to mouse chromosome 12 in a region
showing homology of synteny with human chromosome 14q. By analysis of
radiation hybrid and somatic cell hybrid panels, Chadwick and Frischauf
(1998) confirmed that CD39L4 is located on human chromosome 14q24.
Chadwick and Frischauf (1998) concluded that CD39L4 is the human homolog
of MNTPase.

613648	TITLE *613648 MATERNALLY EXPRESSED GENE 8; MEG8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for human orthologs of imprinted ovine genes, Charlier et
al. (2001) identified MEG8. They noted that MEG8 contains a high degree
of interspersed repeats and, while represented by several ESTs, appears
to lack a protein-coding sequence. RT-PCR of ovine tissues revealed
highest expression in skeletal muscle and kidney. Meg8 was maternally
expressed in sheep.

By searching for human orthologs of an imprinted small nucleolar RNA
(snoRNA) gene from rat chromosome 6 in a syntenic region of human
chromosome 14, Cavaille et al. (2002) identified SNORD112 (613649),
which they called 14q(0), within an intron of the MEG8 gene. Downstream
of MEG8, they identified 9 tandem copies of SNORD113 (see 613650)
followed by 31 tandem copies of SNORD114 (see 613651), which they called
the 14q(I) and 14q(II) clusters, respectively. Each of the 70- to
75-nucleotide snoRNAs contains the characteristic C/D-prime/C-prime/D
motifs and a terminal 5-prime-to-3-prime stem structure with a conserved
sequence. RT-PCR of several overlapping clones suggested that most of
the snoRNA genes originate from introns of a large RNA that includes
exons of the upstream MEG8 gene in addition to exons that overlap the
SNORD113 and SNORD114 gene clusters. This large transcript appears to be
devoid of significant protein-coding potential. Northern blot analysis
revealed highest SNORD112 expression in brain and uterus, with lower
expression in heart and weak expression in other tissues examined. This
expression pattern was identical to that of SNORD113 and SNORD114.

GENE STRUCTURE

Charlier et al. (2001) determined that the MEG8 gene contains at least 8
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Cavaille et al. (2002) mapped the MEG8
gene to chromosome 14q32.

609360	TITLE *609360 RENALASE; RNLS
;;CHROMOSOME 10 OPEN READING FRAME 59; C10ORF59
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Renalase is a flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent amine oxidase that
is secreted into the blood from the kidney (Xu et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching databases for transcripts likely to encode proteins
secreted from the kidney, Xu et al. (2005) identified a cDNA clone
encoding renalase. The deduced 342-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 37.8 kD. Renalase contains an N-terminal signal
sequence and an amino oxidase domain. Northern blot analysis of several
tissues detected robust expression of a 1.5-kb transcript in kidney, and
lower expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver. A minor
transcript of about 2.4 kb was detected in skeletal muscle, and a minor
transcript of 1.2 kb was detected in kidney and liver. In situ
hybridization detected renalase in renal glomeruli and proximal tubules,
and in cardiomyocytes. Western blot analysis detected renalase at an
apparent molecular mass of about 35 kD in human urine. There was also a
signal at 67 to 75 kD, suggesting that the protein may form a doublet.
Renalase was also detected in the plasma of healthy individuals, but not
in the plasma of patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Xu et al. (2005) demonstrated that epitope-tagged renalase was secreted
from transfected human embryonic kidney cells. Purified and recombinant
renalase metabolized catecholamines, with dopamine as the preferred
substrate, followed by epinephrine and norepinephrine. Within 30 seconds
of a single bolus injection of recombinant renalase into rats, systolic,
diastolic, and mean arterial pressure were decreased in a dose-dependent
manner. Renalase also decreased cardiac contractility and heart rate,
but peripheral vascular resistance was unchanged.

GENE STRUCTURE

Xu et al. (2005) determined that the renalase gene contains 9 exons and
spans about 311 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Xu et al. (2005) mapped the RNLS gene to
chromosome 10q23.33.

601984	TITLE *601984 NUCLEAR RECEPTOR COACTIVATOR 4; NCOA4
;;RET-ACTIVATING GENE ELE1; ELE1;;
ANDROGEN RECEPTOR COACTIVATOR, 70-KD; ARA70
PTC3 CHIMERIC ONCOGENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Androgen receptor (AR; 313700) is a transcriptional factor that belongs
to the steroid receptor superfamily. Using the C terminus of AR as bait
in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library, Yeh and Chang
(1996) cloned NCOA4, which they designated ARA70. The interaction
between the AR bait and NCOA4 occurred only in the presence of
dihydrotestosterone. The deduced 614-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 70 kD. It shares 99% homology with the protein encoded
by the RET-fused gene (RFG) cDNA isolated from human thyroid by Santoro
et al. (1994). Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected highest
expression of Ara70 in thymus, prostate, testis, and adrenal gland.
Intermediate expression was found in several other mouse tissues, and no
expression was detected in brain cortex, liver, spleen, and seminal
vesicle.

GENE FUNCTION

Yeh and Chang (1996) showed that ARA70 is a ligand-dependent
AR-associated protein that functions in human prostate cancer cells as
an activator to enhance AR transcriptional activity 10-fold in the
presence of dihydrotestosterone or testosterone, but not
hydroxyflutamide. ARA70 induced only slightly the transcriptional
activity of other steroid receptors such as estrogen receptor (133430)
in human prostate cancer cells.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, Minoletti et al. (1994) mapped
the ELE1 gene to chromosome 10q11.2. The ELE1 gene maps more than 500 kb
from the RET protooncogene (164761), which also maps to chromosome
10q11.2.

CYTOGENETICS

The PTC3 oncogene (RET/PTC3) is an activated form of the RET
protooncogene, which is frequently rearranged in papillary thyroid
carcinoma (PTC; 188550). RET/PTC3 results from a structural
rearrangement between the ELE1 and RET genes on chromosome 10
(Bongarzone et al., 1994) and has been observed in both sporadic and
radiation-associated post-Chernobyl PTC. Minoletti et al. (1994) found
that the karyotype of 2 PTC3-positive PTCs did not show evidence of
chromosome 10 abnormalities, indicating that a cytogenetically
undetectable paracentric inversion within chromosome 10q11.2 generates
PTC3. To understand the molecular basis that predisposes RET and ELE1
genes to be recurrent targets of 'illegitimate' recombination,
Bongarzone et al. (1997) examined the genomic regions containing the
ELE1/RET breakpoints in 6 Italian sporadic, RET/PTC3-positive tumors and
3 radiation-associated tumors from children living in areas contaminated
by the Chernobyl accident; the latter tumors also expressed RET/PTC3
oncogene. They found that the breakpoints in both genes clustered in
regions that they designated ELE1-bcr (1.8 kb) and RET-bcr (1.9 kb). In
all sporadic tumors and in 1 post-Chernobyl tumor, the ELE1/RET
recombination corresponded with short sequences of homology (3 to 7 bp)
between the 2 rearranging genes. In addition, Bongarzone et al. (1997)
observed an interesting distribution of the post-Chernobyl breakpoints
in ELE1-bcr located within an Alu element, or between 2 close Alu
elements, and always in AT-rich regions. In the case of the ELE1/RET
fusion gene, the 5-prime end of ELE1 is fused to the tyrosine kinase
portion of the RET gene. See 601985 for discussion of the PTC1 chimeric
oncogene.

Klugbauer et al. (2001) identified 22 reciprocal and 4 nonreciprocal
ELE1 and RET rearrangements in 26 post-Chernobyl PTC tumor samples.
Breakpoints were distributed in the affected introns of both genes
without significant clustering, and there was no accumulation of
breakpoints at the 2 Alu elements in the ELE1 sequence. However, at
least 1 topoisomerase I (126420) site was found at or near all
breakpoints, indicating a potential role for this enzyme in the
formation of DNA strand breaks and/or ELE1 and RET inversions. Due to
the presence of short regions of sequence homology and short direct and
inverted repeats at the majority of breakpoints, Klugbauer et al. (2001)
concluded that chimeric ELE1/RET and RET/ELE1 genes are formed by a
nonhomologous DNA end-joining mechanism.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Undermasculinization of the male genitalia is a common congenital
disorder, but in only a small proportion of cases is there an
identifiable abnormality of androgen production or of the androgen
receptor. Lim et al. (2001) studied 27 subjects in whom no abnormality
of the androgen receptor could be established as the cause of
undermasculinized genitalia. They found likewise no abnormality in the
NCOA4 gene.

147851	TITLE *147851 INTERLEUKIN 5 RECEPTOR, ALPHA; IL5RA
;;IL5R
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tavernier et al. (1991) isolated cDNA clones encoding 2 receptor
proteins involved in the binding of human interleukin-5 (IL5; 147850).
The major transcript of this receptor gene, as analyzed in both
eosinophilic sublines of human promyelocytic cells and in eosinophilic
myelocytes grown from cord blood, encodes a secreted form of this
receptor. A second component of the receptor was found to be identical
to the beta chain of the human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor high affinity receptor (CSF2RB; 138981). The finding that IL5 and
CSF2 share a receptor subunit provides a molecular basis for the
observation that these cytokines can partially interfere with each
other's binding and have highly overlapping biologic activities on
eosinophils. The common use of the same receptor component is
reminiscent of the structural relatedness of IL3 (147740), IL5, and
GM-CSF (CSF2; 138960). The homology at the C terminus may indicate a
related binding domain. The common origin of all 3 cytokines is also
suggested by their clustered chromosomal localization and by the
structure of their genes.

The 60-kD alpha chain binds IL5; the 130-kD beta chain increases the
binding affinity but cannot bind IL5 by itself. In addition, the beta
chain is required for signal transduction, most likely by association
with other receptor components. Tavernier et al. (1992) demonstrated
that soluble isoforms of the alpha subunit result from a 'normal'
splicing event or from the absence of splicing, whereas synthesis of
membrane-anchored forms of the alpha subunit requires alternative
splicing.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a granulocyte cDNA library with the
cytoplasmic domain of IL5RA as bait, Geijsen et al. (2001) identified an
interaction of IL5RA with syntenin (SDCBP; 602217). GST pull-down,
BIAcore, coimmunoprecipitation, and deletion mutant analyses confirmed
an association of syntenin with the last 15 C-terminal residues of
IL5RA; syntenin did not interact with CFS2RB. Within this 15-residue
stretch of IL5RA, the C-terminal phenylalanine is critical. Deletion of
either of the 2 tandem PDZ domains of syntenin, which are known to
interact with C-terminal peptide sequences, abrogated the IL5RA-syntenin
interaction. A second 2-hybrid screen identified the mouse
transcriptional factor Sox4 (184430) as a binding partner for syntenin
but not for IL5RA. The syntenin-Sox4 interaction occurs outside of the
PDZ domains of syntenin. Luciferase reporter analysis and fluorescence
microscopy showed that IL5, but not IL3, induces cytoplasmic and nuclear
expression of syntenin and, in a syntenin- and cytoplasmic
IL5RA-dependent manner, of Sox4. Geijsen et al. (2001) concluded that
syntenin acts as an adaptor molecule in the IL5RA-mediated activation of
SOX4. They also noted that mice lacking either Il5ra or Sox4 have
defects in B-cell development.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sun et al. (1995) identified a promoter (P1) located 5-prime upstream of
exon 1 of the IL5RA gene. Zhang et al. (1997) showed that an additional
promoter (P2) was present in the 5-prime upstream region of exon 2 of
the IL5RA gene.

MAPPING

By use of recombinant inbred strains of mice, Gough and Rakar (1992)
localized the murine equivalent of the IL5R gene to the distal half of
chromosome 6. The position lay between 2 regions of conserved synteny,
one on human chromosome 2 and the second on human chromosome 3. The
human IL5R gene presumably maps to one of these 2 chromosomes. Isobe et
al. (1992) mapped the IL5RA gene to 3p26-p24 by Southern blot analysis
of DNA from a panel of mouse-human hybrid somatic cell lines
complemented by in situ hybridization. Jacob et al. (1993) assigned the
IL5R gene to 3p26-p25 by study of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids
containing various portions of human chromosome 3 and using a
human-specific IL5R tandem repeat marker. Using the mouse-specific
tandem repeat marker in recombinant inbred strains of mice, they
assigned the Il5r gene to the distal part of mouse chromosome 6, close
to the Raf1 locus.

606343	TITLE *606343 POLYMERASE, DNA, LAMBDA; POLL
DESCRIPTION DNA polymerases can participate in both replication of the genome and
DNA repair processes. The human genome contains multiple DNA polymerase
genes.

CLONING

By searching sequence databases to identify new members of the polX
family, Aoufouchi et al. (2000) identified EST clones representing 2 DNA
polymerases, POLM (606344) and POLL, which they called pol mu and pol
lambda, respectively. By screening bone marrow and lymph node cDNA
libraries, they isolated a full-length POLL cDNA. POLL encodes a deduced
575-amino acid protein predicted to contain a polX domain, a BRCA-1
C-terminal (BRCT) domain, and 2 helix-hairpin-helix (HHH) DNA-binding
motifs. POLL structurally resembles terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase
(TDT; 187410). It shares 34% amino acid identity with DNA polymerase
beta (POLB; 174760) and 82% identity with mouse Poll. Aoufouchi et al.
(2000) found that POLL has template-dependent DNA polymerase activity in
vitro. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.7-kb POLL transcript with
highest expression in testis and fetal liver and very weak expression in
many other tissues. They identified POLL splice variants which they
considered to be nonfunctional. Using semiquantitative RT-PCR
amplification, Aoufouchi et al. (2000) concluded that POLL mRNA
expression is downregulated in a dose- and time-dependent manner upon

610130	TITLE *610130 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 26 (SULFATE TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 1; SLC26A1
;;SULFATE ANION TRANSPORTER 1; SAT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SLC26A1 belongs to a family of transporters that mediate electroneutral
exchange of Cl- for HCO3- across the plasma membrane (Lohi et al.,
2000).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of human kidney mRNA using primers derived from the mouse
Slc26a1 cDNA, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Regeer et al. (2003)
cloned SLC26A1. They also identified a SLC26A1 variant lacking exon 2 in
the 5-prime UTR. The deduced 701-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of about 75 kD. It has 12 putative transmembrane domains
and intracellular N and C termini. SLC26A1 contains a sulfate
transporter signature, a phosphopantetheine attachment site, a STAS
domain, a sulfate transporter family sequence, 2 putative extracellular
N-glycosylation sites, and multiple putative intracellular
phosphorylation sites. PCR analysis showed highest expression in kidney
and liver, with lower expression in brain, colon, thymus, spleen, small
intestine, leukocytes, pancreas, testis, and prostate.

GENE FUNCTION

Regeer et al. (2003) found that Xenopus oocytes injected with SLC26A1
cRNA showed 40-fold induction of sulfate uptake, 5-fold induction of
chloride uptake, and 6-fold induction of oxalate uptake compared with
water-injected controls. Formate was not a transport substrate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Regeer et al. (2003) determined that the SLC26A1 gene spans 5.8 kb and
contains 4 exons, with translation initiation beginning in exon 3. The
5-prime flanking region is 60% GC rich, lacks canonical TATA and CAAT
boxes, and has a large number of potential cis-acting elements
recognized by transcription factors. Regeer et al. (2003) identified a
minimal promoter containing an AP1 (165160) site that was essential for
transcription.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Lohi et al. (2000) mapped the SLC26A1 gene
to chromosome 4p16.3.

601166	TITLE *601166 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 15; GPR15
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using primers based on conserved regions of the opioid-related receptors
(e.g., 165196), Heiber et al. (1996) isolated a PCR product that they
then used to locate the full-length coding region of a novel human
receptor gene, GPR15. GPR15 shares sequence identity with the
angiotensin II receptors type 1 (106165) and type 2 (300034), the
interleukin 8 b receptor (146928), and the orphan receptors GPR1
(600239) and angiotensin receptor-like 1 (600052).

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Heiber et al. (1996) mapped GPR15
to 3q11.2-q13.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Kim et al. (2013) showed that GPR15, an orphan heterotrimeric guanine
nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor, controlled the
specific homing of T cells, particularly FOXP3 (300292)-positive
regulatory cells (T-regs), to the large intestine lamina propria. GRP15
expression was modulated by gut microbiota and transforming growth
factor beta-1 (TGFB1; 190180), but not by retinoic acid. GPR15-deficient
mice were prone to develop more severe large intestine inflammation,
which was rescued by the transfer of GPR15-sufficient T-regs. Kim et al.
(2013) concluded that their findings described a T-cell homing receptor
for the large intestine lamina propria and indicated that GPR15 plays a
role in mucosal immune tolerance largely by regulating the influx of
T-regs.

606274	TITLE *606274 CASEIN KINASE I, GAMMA-1; CSNK1G1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Casein kinase I is the most abundant serine/threonine kinase in
eukaryotic cell extracts. Multiple isoforms of the enzyme exist. The
gamma-1 isoform is involved in growth and morphogenesis of eukaryotic
cells.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologs of rat Csnk1g1 and by
screening a testis cDNA library, Kusuda et al. (2000) obtained cDNAs
encoding short and long splice variants of human CSNK1G1, which they
called CSNK1G1S and CSNK1G1L, respectively. Sequence analysis predicted
that the 422-amino acid CSNK1G1L protein possesses a C-terminal most
terminal sequence motif (MTM), which it shares with CSNK1G2 (602214) and
CSNK1G3 (604253). The CSNK1G1S protein contains 393 amino acids and is
95%, 81%, and 84% homologous to rat Csnk1g1, Csnk1g2, and Csnk1g3,
respectively; it does not have the MTM. RT-PCR analysis detected
ubiquitous expression of CSNK1G1L, whereas expression of CSNK1G1S was
restricted to testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a protein modification screen for regulators of LRP6 (603507),
Davidson et al. (2005) described the identification of Xenopus casein
kinase 1-gamma (CSNK1G1), a membrane-bound member of the casein kinase-1
(CK1) family. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments showed
that CSNK1G1 is both necessary and sufficient to transduce LRP6
signaling in vertebrates and Drosophila cells. In Xenopus embryos,
CSNK1G1 was required during anterio-posterior patterning to promote
posteriorizing Wnt/beta-catenin (164820/116806) signaling. CSNK1G1 is
associated with LRP6, which has multiple, modular CK1 phosphorylation
sites. Wnt treatment induced the rapid CK1-gamma-mediated
phosphorylation of these sites within LRP6, which, in turn, promoted the
recruitment of the scaffold protein Axin (603816). Davidson et al.
(2005) concluded that their results reveal an evolutionarily conserved
mechanism that couples Wnt receptor activation to the cytoplasmic signal
transduction apparatus.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Kusuda et al. (2000) mapped the CSNK1G1 gene to
15q22.1-q22.31.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Fc receptor with low affinity for IgG (FCGR3, or CD16) is encoded by
2 nearly identical genes, FCGR3A (146740) and FCGR3B, resulting in
tissue-specific expression of alternative membrane-anchored isoforms.
FCGR3A encodes a transmembrane protein expressed on activated
monocytes/macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and a subset of T
cells. In contrast, FCGR3B encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored protein that is expressed constitutively by neutrophils
and after gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) stimulation by eosinophils
(summary by Gessner et al., 1995).

CLONING

Ory et al. (1989) reported the cDNA sequences encoding the NA1 and NA2
forms of FCGR3 on neutrophils, which are encoded by the FCGR3B gene.

By Western blot and flow cytometric analyses, Ravetch and Perussia
(1989) demonstrated differential expression of FCGR3 on
polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and NK cells. The glycoprotein on
NK cells (FCGR3A) had a molecular mass 6 to 10 kD larger than that on
neutrophils (FCGR3B) and was resistant to phosphatidylinositol-specific
phospholipase C. Transcripts derived from FCGR3A and FCGR3B in NK cells
and PMNs, respectively, have multiple single nucleotide differences,
including 1 that converts a termination codon to a codon encoding arg,
thereby extending the cytoplasmic domain by 21 amino acids and
introducing a transmembrane anchor for FCGR3A in NK cells. The deduced
FCGR3A protein contains 254 amino acids, whereas the deduced FCGR3B
protein contains 233 amino acids. Ravetch and Perussia (1989) concluded
that cell type-specific expression of 2 genes encoding alternative FCGR3
proteins has a significant effect on the biologic functions of the
molecules.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gessner et al. (1995) isolated and sequenced genomic clones of FCGR3A
and FCGR3B, located their transcription initiation sites, identified the
different organizations of their 5-prime regions, and demonstrated 4
distinct classes of FCGR3A transcripts compared with a single class of
FCGR3B transcripts. The gene promoters displayed different
tissue-specific transcriptional activities reflecting expression of
FCGR3A in NK cells and FCGR3B in neutrophils.

MAPPING

By spot blot analysis, Grundy et al. (1989) mapped the FCGR2A (146790)
and FCGR2B genes, which are separated by about 200 kb, to chromosome 1q.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Sondermann et al. (2000) described the crystal structures of a soluble
FCGR3 (CD16B), an Fc fragment from human IgG1 (Fc1), and their complex.
In the 1:1 complex, the receptor binds to the 2 halves of the Fc
fragment in contact with residues of the C-gamma-2 domains and the hinge
region. Upon complex formation, the angle between the 2 soluble CD16B
domains increases significantly and the Fc fragment opens
asymmetrically. The high degree of amino acid conservation between
soluble CD16B and other Fc receptors, and similarly between Fc1 and
related immunoglobulins, suggested similar structures and modes of
association.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Genetic polymorphism of Fc receptor III on neutrophils is detectable by
several means, including reaction with antibodies against the biallelic
neutrophil-specific antigen system NA; differences in electrophoretic
mobility on SDS-PAGE; and differences in mRNAs encoding the allelic
forms of Fc receptor III. Ory et al. (1989) described the relationship
between structural and antigenic polymorphisms of FCGR3B and showed that
these reflect differences at the level of primary protein structure.

In a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700), Clark et
al. (1990) found that neutrophils were not recognized by either
monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to Fc receptor III, but reacted
normally with antibodies to Fc receptor II (FCGR2A), as well as with
antibodies to complement receptor-1, complement receptor-3 (120980), and
decay-accelerating factor (DAF; 125240). Analysis of genomic DNA showed
that failure of the patient's neutrophils to express Fc receptor III was
most likely due to an abnormality of the gene encoding the receptor.

Huizinga et al. (1990) described a case of neonatal isoimmune
neutropenia in which the mother was completely lacking FcRIII (CD16) on
neutrophils, but normal expression of FcRIII on natural killer cells.
The mother had isoantibodies in her blood against CD16 antigen,
apparently produced during pregnancy and responsible for the neutropenia
in her child. Fc receptor III is encoded by 2 separate genes: FcRIII-1,
which encodes the neutrophil receptor, and FcRIII-2, which encodes the
transmembrane receptor on natural killer cells and macrophages. The
neutrophil FcRIII deficiency appeared to be due to deletion of the
FcRIII-1 gene, while the FcRIII-2 gene was normally present. Her parents
were found to be heterozygous for the defect.

Neutrophil-specific antigens have been identified in the course of study
of isoimmune neonatal neutropenia due to fetomaternal incompatibility.
(Since it occurs in multiple sibs, neonatal neutropenia might simulate a
recessive disorder.) Two loci, termed NA and NB (162860), were
identified (Lalezari and Radel, 1974), with 2 alleles known at the NA
locus. These are NA1 and NA2 and have a frequency of 0.377 and 0.633,
respectively, in Caucasians and 0.651 in 0.302, respectively, in
Japanese (Ohto and Matsuo, 1989). The 'NA-null' status of the mother
reported by Huizinga et al. (1990) indicated that CD16 and NA are the
same molecule. Fromont et al. (1992) described a healthy woman who after
multiple pregnancies developed an antibody directed against CD16 which
caused transient neonatal alloimmune neutropenia (NAIN). The woman's
polymorphonuclear leukocytes did not react with monoclonal NA1 and NA2
antibodies, indicating the NA-null phenotype. Fromont et al. (1992)
determined that in a healthy, white population of 3,377 random blood
donors there were only 4 other instances of the NA-null phenotype. Their
proposita was the only one with an allo-CD16 antibody. The gene
frequency was calculated to be 0.0274 +/- 0.0059.

The neutrophil-specific antigen NC1 was defined by an antibody (Vaz) in
the serum of a multiparous mother who gave birth to a child with
alloimmune neonatal neutropenia (Lalezari et al., 1970). This antigen
has a gene frequency of about 0.80 (Lalezari et al., 1970). NC1 was
found to be associated with the neutrophil-specific antigen NA2,
although the precise relationship of NC1 and NA2 was unclear. Using the
antigen capture assay MAIGA and the granulocyte (GIFT) and lymphocyte
(LIFT) immunofluorescence tests, Bux et al. (1995) obtained results
indicating that NC1 and NA2 antigens are identical.

Aitman et al. (2006) showed that copy number variation (CNV) of the
orthologous rat and human Fcgr3 (FCGR3A; 146740) genes is a determinant
of susceptibility to immunologically mediated glomerulonephritis.
Positional cloning identified loss of the rat-specific Fcgr3 paralog
'Fcgr3-related sequence' (Fcgr3rs) as a determinant of macrophage
overactivity and glomerulonephritis in Wistar Kyoto rats. In humans, low
copy number of FCGR3B, an ortholog of rat Fcgr3, was associated with
glomerulonephritis in the autoimmune disorder SLE. Aitman et al. (2006)
concluded that their finding that gene CNV predisposes to
immunologically mediated renal disease in 2 mammalian species provides
direct evidence for the importance of genome plasticity in the evolution
of genetically complex phenotypes, including susceptibility to common
human disease.

Following up on the study of Aitman et al. (2006) in a larger sample,
Fanciulli et al. (2007) confirmed and strengthened their previous
finding of an association between low FCGR3B copy number and
susceptibility to glomerulonephritis in SLE patients. Low copy number
was also associated with risk of systemic SLE with no known renal
involvement as well as with microscopic polyangiitis and Wegener
granulomatosis (608710), but not with organ- specific Graves disease
(275000) or Addison disease (240200), in British and French cohorts.
Fanciulli et al. (2007) concluded that low FCGR3B copy number or
complete FCGR3B deficiency has a key role in the development of specific
autoimmunity.

Willcocks et al. (2008) confirmed that low copy number of FCGR3B was
associated with SLE (152700) in a Caucasian U.K. population, but they
were unable to find an association in a Chinese population.
Investigations of the functional effects of FCGR3B CNV revealed that
FCGR3B CNV correlated with cell surface expression, soluble FCGR3B
production, and neutrophil adherence to and uptake of immune complexes
both in a patient family and in the general population. Willcocks et al.
(2008) found that individuals from 3 U.K. cohorts with antineutrophil
cytoplasmic antibody-associated systemic vasculitis (AASV) were more
likely to have high FCGR3B CNV. They proposed that FCGR3B CNV is
involved in immune complex clearance, possibly explaining the
association of low CNV with SLE and high CNV with AASV.

Among 1,115 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) and 654
controls, Robinson et al. (2012) found a significant association between
FCGR3B deletions and disease (OR = 1.50, p = 0.028). The association was
more apparent in rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive disease (OR = 1.61, p =
0.011). Robinson et al. (2012) noted that the general association (p =
0.028) would not remain significant if corrected for multiple testing,
but the evidence was strengthened by the stronger association in the
RF-positive group of patients. The level of FCGR3B expression on
neutrophils was shown to correlate with gene copy number. The results
implicated an important role for neutrophils in the pathogenesis of RA,
potentially through reduced FCGR3B-mediated immune complex clearance.
The authors used a novel quantitative sequence variant assay in the
study.

In a metaanalysis of 8 published studies examining the association of
FCGR3B CNVs in autoimmune diseases, McKinney and Merriman (2012) found
that low (less than 2) gene copy number was associated with SLE (OR of
1.59, p = 9.1 x 10(-7)), but not with rheumatoid arthritis (OR of 1.36,
p = 0.15). A combined autoimmune phenotype analysis, including
vasculitis, ulcerative colitis (see 266600), Kawasaki disease (611775),
and other disorders, supported FCGR3B deletions as a risk factor for
non-organ-specific autoimmunity (OR = 1.44, p = 2.9 x 10(-9)). The
findings implicated defects in the clearance of immune complexes in the
etiology of non-organ-specific autoimmune disease.

Mueller et al. (2013) found that the increased risk of SLE associated
with reduced copy number of FCGR3B can be explained by the presence of a
chimeric gene, FCGR2B-prime, that occurs as a consequence of FCGR3B
deletion on FCGR3B zero-copy haplotypes. The FCGR2B-prime gene consists
of upstream elements and a 5-prime coding region that derive from FCGR2C
(612169), and a 3-prime coding region that derives from FCGR2B (604590).
The coding sequence of FCGR2B-prime is identical to that of FCGR2B, but
FCGR2B-prime would be expected to be under the control of 5-prime
flanking sequences derived from FCGR2C. Mueller et al. (2013) found by
flow cytometry, immunoblotting, and cDNA sequencing that presence of the
chimeric FCGR2B-prime gene results in the ectopic presence of
Fc-gamma-RIIb on natural killer cells, providing an explanation for SLE
risk associated with reduced FCGR3B copy number. To pursue the
underlying mechanism of SLE disease association with FCGR3B copy number
variation, Mueller et al. (2013) aligned the reference sequence (GRCh37)
of the proximal block of the FCGR locus (chr1:161,480,906-161,564,008)
to that of the distal block (chr1:161,562,570-161,645,839).
Identification of informative paralogous sequence variants (PSVs)
enabled Mueller et al. (2013) to narrow the potential breakpoint region
to a 24.5-kb region of paralogy between then 2 ancestral duplicated
blocks. The complete absence of nonpolymorphic PSVs in the 24.5-kb
region prevented more precise localization of the breakpoints in
FCGR3B-deleted or FCGR3B-duplicated haplotypes.

EVOLUTION

By determining the nature and rate of copy number variation (CNV)
mutation and investigating the global variation of disease-associated
variation at the FCGR locus, Machado et al. (2012) determined that CNV
of the FCGR3 genes is mediated by recurrent nonallelic homologous
recombination between the 2 segmental duplications that carry FCGR3A and
FCGR3B. They showed that pathogen richness, particularly helminth
pathogens, is likely to have influenced the patterns of variation in
FCGRs in humans. Machado et al. (2012) proposed that alterations to IgG
binding in the context of helminth infection have driven positive
selection in FCGR among different mammalian species, linking
evolutionary pressure of helminth infection with autoimmune disease via
adaptation at the genetic level. This model supports the 'hygiene
hypothesis,' which states that in the absence of chronic helminth
infection in modern populations, previously selected alleles respond to
immune system challenges differently and therefore may alter
susceptibility to autoimmune disease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) found that Fcrg (FCER1G; 147139) -/-
mice showed reduced mortality in an acute peritonitis model caused by
cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) compared with wildtype mice. The
reduced mortality in Fcrg -/- mice was associated with lower serum and
peritoneal Tnf (191160) and significantly increased capacity of
neutrophils and macrophages to phagocytose E. coli. Mice lacking Fcgr3
(the only Fcgr3 gene in mice) also had reduced sepsis after CLP. Fcgr3
bound E. coli, inducing Fcrg phosphorylation, recruitment of tyrosine
phosphatase Shp1 (PTPN6; 176883), and dephosphorylation of
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K; see 171834). Decreased Pi3k
activity inhibited E. coli phagocytosis and increased Tnf production
through Tlr4 (603030). Confocal microscopy demonstrated negative
regulation of Marco (604870) by Fcrg. Interaction of E. coli with Fcgr3
induced recruitment of Shp1 to Marco and inhibited E. coli phagocytosis.
Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) concluded that binding of E. coli to
FCGR3 triggers an inhibitory FCRG pathway that impairs MARCO-mediated
bacterial clearance and activates TNF secretion.

Ory et al. (1989) found nucleotide changes in the FCGR3B gene predicting
4 amino acid differences between the NA1 and NA2 alloantigens of
neutrophils involved in alloimmune neonatal neutropenia. As a result,
NA1 FCGR3 has only 4 potential N-linked glycosylation sites compared
with 6 in NA2 FCGR3. In addition, Ory et al. (1989) found a silent
nucleotide change at codon 38: CTC (leu38) in NA1; CTT (leu38) in NA2.

608273	TITLE *608273 INTERLEUKIN 27; IL27
;;INTERLEUKIN 27, 28-KD SUBUNIT;;
IL27p28;;
INTERLEUKIN 30; IL30
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IL30, a member of the long-chain 4-helix bundle cytokine family, and
EBI3 (605816), form the IL27 heterodimer, which is expressed by
antigen-presenting cells. IL27 triggers expansion of antigen-specific
naive CD4 (186940)-positive T cells and promotes polarization towards a
Th1 phenotype with expression of gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570). IL27
acts in synergy with IL12 (see IL12B; 161561) and binds to WSX1 (IL27RA;
605350) (Pflanz et al., 2002).

CLONING

By searching sequence databases for IL6 (147620)-related proteins,
Pflanz et al. (2002) identified IL30, which they termed p28 because of
its apparent molecular mass as determined by SDS-PAGE. The predicted
243-amino acid protein, which is 73% identical to the mouse protein,
contains an N-terminal signal peptide, several O-glycosylation sites,
and a stretch of 13 glutamate residues between helices C and D.

GENE FUNCTION

Pflanz et al. (2002) showed that coexpression of IL30 with EBI3, but not
with other IL6 family members, permitted the release of IL30 from an
intracellular location and its secretion. Real-time quantitative PCR and
ELISA analysis detected coexpression of EBI3 and IL30 in
lipopolysaccharide-activated monocytes and dendritic cells; only EBI3
was detected in placenta. Naive, but not memory, T cells proliferated in
response to the heterodimer formed by IL30 and EBI3, which Pflanz et al.
(2002) termed IL27, and did so synergistically in response to IL27 and
IL12. Secretion of IFNG by T cells and natural killer cells required the
presence of both IL27 and IL12; IL27 did not promote the production of
Th2 cytokines. Screening of cells expressing members of the IL6/IL12
family of signaling receptors and coimmunoprecipitation experiments
demonstrated that only WSX1 bound IL27. Kinetic analysis showed that
IL30 was transiently expressed prior to IL12A (161560) and IL12B. EBI3
expression was also rapidly upregulated, but it persisted somewhat
longer than that of IL30. Pflanz et al. (2002) proposed that IL27, IL12,
and IL23 (605580) act sequentially, with some overlap, on naive and
memory Th1 cells in response to pathogen challenge.

Takeda et al. (2003) showed that STAT1 (600555) interacted with a
conserved cytoplasmic domain tyrosine residue of WSX1 after the residue
was phosphorylated. IL27 stimulation induced phosphorylation of STAT1
and expression of TBET (TBX21; 604895) and IL12RB2 (601642) in wildtype,
but not WSX1-deficient, naive CD4-positive T cells. Together with IL12,
IL27 augmented IFNG secretion in wildtype, but not WSX1-deficient, naive
CD4-positive T cells. Takeda et al. (2003) concluded that the IL27-WSX1
signaling system acts before the IL12R system in STAT1-mediated TBET
induction during the initiation of Th1 differentiation.

Pflanz et al. (2004) found that transfection of WSX1 into a cell line
expressing gp130 (600694) but only low levels of WSX1 resulted in
IL27-dependent phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 (102582). In addition,
they showed that anti-gp130 blocked IL27-mediated cellular effects.
Quantitative PCR analysis indicated that, in addition to naive
CD4-positive T cells, numerous cell types expressed both gp130 and WSX1,
including mast cells. IL27 stimulation of mast cells resulted in
upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression. Pflanz et al.
(2004) concluded that IL27 not only contributes to the development of an
adaptive immune response through its action on CD4-positive T cells, but
also directly acts on cells of the innate immune system.

Batten et al. (2006) found that Il27ra -/- mice were hypersusceptible to
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), with significantly
increased demyelination and inflammation, and had more inflammatory Il17
(IL17A; 603149)-producing T (Th17) cells in draining lymph nodes
compared with wildtype mice. Flow cytometric analysis showed that
increased Il17 production also occurred in the central nervous system of
mutant mice. In vitro, Il27 was more efficient than Ifng in suppressing
Th17 cell differentiation, and it could overcome the Th17-promoting
effects of Il6. The suppressive activity of Il27 was dependent on Stat1
activation. EAE was ameliorated in Il27ra -/- mice treated with
anti-Il17, but it was more severe in mice lacking both Il27ra and Ifngr
(107470). Batten et al. (2006) concluded that IL27 inhibits Th17
differentiation in a STAT1-dependent, IFNG-independent manner, and that
IL27 functions by antagonizing IL6, which is required for Th17 cell
differentiation and EAE pathogenesis.

Using RT-PCR, Stumhofer et al. (2006) found that mice with toxoplasmic
encephalitis showed a dramatic increase in expression of Il27 and a much
smaller increase in expression of Ebi3. T. gondii-infected mice lacking
Il27ra were protected from acute lethality by Ctla4 (123890)-Ig
treatment, but they succumbed during the chronic phase of infection due
to inflammation and necrosis associated with pathogenic Cd4-positive,
Il17-expressing T cells infiltrating the brain. Treatment of T cells
with anti-Il6 or Il27 inhibited Il17 production. Il27-mediated
inhibition of Il17 production was dependent on Stat1 and independent of
inhibition of Il6 signaling mediated by Socs3 (604176). Stumhofer et al.
(2006) proposed that IL27 may be a useful target in treating
inflammatory diseases mediated by Th17 cells.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Pflanz et al. (2002) mapped the IL30 gene
to chromosome 16p11.

611941	TITLE *611941 ATPase FAMILY, AAA DOMAIN-CONTAINING, MEMBER 2; ATAD2
;;AAA NUCLEAR COREGULATOR, CANCER-ASSOCIATED; ANCCA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATAD2 is an ATPase involved in the control of chromatin structure and
gene transcription (Caron et al., 2010).

CLONING

By microarray analysis, Zou et al. (2007) identified ATAD2, which they
called ANCCA, as a gene upregulated in breast cancer cells
overexpressing ACTR (NCOA3; 601937) or treated with estrogen. They
obtained the full-length cDNA by database analysis and PCR of a
leukocyte cDNA library. The deduced 1,390-amino acid protein contains an
N-terminal acidic region, followed by 2 AAA ATPase domains (see 601681)
and a bromodomain. Northern blot analysis detected ANCCA transcripts of
5 and 4.7 kb in estrogen-stimulated breast cancer cells. Western blot
analysis revealed a 170-kD ANCCA protein. Immunofluorescence analysis
showed ANCCA localized primarily in the nucleus. By database analysis,
Zou et al. (2007) identified ANCCA orthologs in all eukaryotes except
Drosophila.

Caron et al. (2010) cloned long (L) and short (S) variants of mouse
Atad2. Atad2-L and Atad2-S encode proteins of 1,364 and 1,040 amino
acids, respectively. RT-PCR of mouse tissues detected Atad2-L in embryos
at various stages and in several adult tissues, including lung, spleen,
testis, and uterus. Atad2-S was detected in testis only. Caron et al.
(2010) also identified human ATAD2, which corresponds to mouse Atad2-L.
No human ortholog of Atad2-S was detected. Quantitative RT-PCR of human
tissues showed robust expression in testis, lower expression in heart,
prostate, and thymus, and much lower expression in all other tissues
examined. Western blot analysis detected ATAD2 and Atad2-L associated
with the chromatin fractions of human H1299 cells and mouse testis,
respectively. Atad2-S was found in both the soluble and insoluble
fractions of mouse testis.

GENE FUNCTION

By microarray, Northern blot, and Wester blot analyses, Zou et al.
(2007) found that overexpression of ACTR or estrogen treatment
upregulated ANCCA mRNA and protein in breast cancer cells. ANCCA
associated directly with estrogen-bound estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha
(ESR1; 133430) and ACTR. Upon estrogen stimulation, ANCCA was
selectively recruited to a subset of ER-alpha target genes, including
cyclin D1 (CCND1; 168461), MYC (190080), and E2F1 (189971), and was
required for their estrogen-induced gene expression and breast cancer
cell proliferation. ANCCA bound and hydrolyzed ATP and was critical for
recruitment of coregulator CBP (CREBBP; 600140) and histone
hyperacetylation at the ER target chromatin. Mutation of lys473 and
glu532 within the Walker A and Walker B motifs, respectively, of AAA
domain-1 of ANCCA rendered ANCCA defective as a coactivator in mediating
estrogen induction of gene expression.

Caron et al. (2010) found that mouse Atad2-S oligomerized via its ATPase
domain and associated with acetylated histone H4 (see 602822) via its
bromodomain. Overexpression of ATAD2 was found in a wide range of human
cancers and was associated with poor prognosis in lung and breast
cancers. Knockdown of ATAD2 in human cell lines revealed that ATAD2
functioned as a global regulator of chromatin structure and function,
with variable impact on gene expression that was dependent on cell type.
In cancer cell lines, knockdown of ATAD2 enhanced apoptosis.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the ATAD2 gene to chromosome 8q24.13 based on an
alignment of the ATAD2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF118088) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

103180	TITLE *103180 ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR 1; ARF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), such as ARF1, are small guanine
nucleotide-binding proteins that enhance the enzymatic activities of
cholera toxin. ARFs are essential and ubiquitous in eukaryotes, being
involved in vesicular transport and functioning as activators of
phospholipase D. The functions of ARF proteins in membrane traffic and
organelle integrity are intimately tied to their reversible association
with membranes and specific interactions with membrane phospholipids. A
common feature of these functions is their regulation by the binding and
hydrolysis of GTP (summary by Bobak et al. (1989) and Amor et al.
(1994)).

CLONING

Bobak et al. (1989) cloned 2 ARF cDNAs, ARF1 and ARF3 (103190), from a
human cerebellum library. Based on deduced amino acid sequences and
patterns of hybridization of cDNA and oligonucleotide probes with
mammalian brain poly(A)+ RNA, human ARF1 is the homolog of bovine ARF1.
Human ARF3, however, appeared to represent a newly identified, third
type of ARF, which differs from bovine ARF1 and bovine ARF2. Peng et al.
(1989) also reported cloning of ADP-ribosylation factor.

Lee et al. (1992) found that human ARF1 is identical to its bovine
counterpart, has a distinctive pattern of tissue and developmental
expression, and is encoded by an mRNA of approximately 1.9 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Coatomer, or COPI (see 601924), is a heptameric protein recruited to
membranes by ARF1. Coat assembly helps in the transport of budding off
membrane between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus.
Using fluorescence microscopy, Presley et al. (2002) showed that guanine
nucleotide exchange-activated ARF1 at the Golgi membrane recruits and
binds cytoplasmic COPI to the membranes. Photobleaching experiments
demonstrated that COPI remains at the membranes after ARF1-GTP has been
hydrolyzed by ARFGAP1 (608377). COPI binds to membrane cargo,
soluble-cargo receptors, or other Golgi proteins. Uncoating, or the
release of COPI from Golgi membranes to the cytoplasm, then occurs,
which can be inhibited by aluminum fluoride. Presley et al. (2002)
concluded from their kinetic and biochemical analyses that COPI and ARF1
continuously bind and release from Golgi membranes, allowing the
membrane at these sites to recruit cargo, alter their phospholipid
composition, and become larger, phase-separated domains.

Endocytosis of glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored proteins and
the fluid phase takes place primarily through a dynamin (see DNM1;
602377)- and clathrin (see CLTC; 118955)-independent, CDC42
(116952)-regulated pinocytic mechanism. In Chinese hamster ovary cells,
Kumari and Mayor (2008) found that reduced activity or levels of Arf1
inhibited GPI-anchored protein and fluid-phase endocytosis without
affecting other clathrin-dependent or -independent endocytic pathways.
Arf1 was activated at distinct sites on the plasma membrane, and it
recruited the CDC42 GTPase-activating protein Arhgap10 (609746) to the
plasma membrane, thereby modulating cell surface Cdc42 dynamics. Kumari
and Mayor (2008) concluded that ARF1 regulates both endocytosis and
secretion and may provide a mechanism for crosstalk between these
processes.

Using a yeast genetic screen for substrates of the Shigella flexneri
type III effector protein IpaJ, Burnaevskiy et al. (2013) identified
Arf1 and Arf2 (ARF4; 601177). Mass spectrometric analysis showed that
IpaJ cleaved the peptide bond between myristoylated gly2 and asn3 of
human ARF1. Further analysis showed that IpaJ cleaved numerous
N-myristoylated proteins with various functions. Burnaevskiy et al.
(2013) concluded that IpaJ is a cysteine protease that cleaves the
N-myrisoylated glycine from ARF1, possibly as the substrate cycles
between activity-dependent conformational states. They proposed that
cleavage of lipidated proteins may be a mechanism of microbial
pathogenesis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Amor et al. (1994) described the 3-dimensional structure of full-length
human ARF1 in its GDP-bound nonmyristoylated form.

Mossessova et al. (1998) reported the crystal structure of the catalytic
Sec7 homology domain of ARNO (602488), a human guanine nucleotide
exchange factor (GEF) for ARF1, determined at 2.2-angstrom resolution.
The Sec7 domain is an elongated, all-helical protein with a distinctive
hydrophobic groove that is phylogenetically conserved. Structure-based
mutagenesis identifies the groove and an adjacent conserved loop as the
ARF-interacting surface. The sites of Sec7 domain interaction on ARF1
have subsequently been mapped, by protein footprinting experiments, to
the switch 1 and switch 2 GTPase regions, leading to a model for the
interaction between ARF GTPases and Sec7 domain exchange factors.

Nucleotide dissociation from small G protein-GEF complexes involves
transient GDP-bound intermediates. In the case of ARF proteins, small G
proteins that regulate membrane traffic in eukaryotic cells, such
intermediates can be trapped either by the natural inhibitor brefeldin A
or by charge reversal at the catalytic glutamate of the Sec7 domain of
their GEFs. Renault et al. (2003) reported the crystal structure of
these intermediates, which shows that membrane recruitment of ARF and
nucleotide dissociation are separate reactions stimulated by the Sec7
domain. The reactions proceed through sequential rotations of the
Arf-GDP core towards the Sec7 catalytic site, and are blocked by
interfacial binding of brefeldin A and unproductive stabilization of GDP
by charge reversal.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lee et al. (1992) determined that the ARF1 gene has 4 introns and spans
approximately 16.5 kb. Exon 1 (46 bp) contains only untranslated
sequence. The 5-prime flanking region has a high GC content but no TATA
or CAAT box, as found in housekeeping genes. The authors stated that the
2 human class I ARF genes, ARF1 and ARF3, have similar exon/intron
organizations and use GC-rich promoters.

MAPPING

Hirai et al. (1996) obtained an expressed sequence tag related to the
ARF1 gene and used fluorescence in situ hybridization to assign ARF1 to
1q42.

611532	TITLE *611532 NUCLEOLAR PROTEIN 6; NOL6
;;NUCLEOLAR RNA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; NRAP;;
UTP22, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; UTP22
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a mouse embryonic stem cell cDNA library with a partial
Nol6 clone, followed by 5-prime RACE, database analysis, and RT-PCR of
human hepatic cell line RNA, Utama et al. (2002) cloned full-length
human and mouse NOL6, which they called NRAP. They identified
NOL6-alpha, -beta, and -gamma isoforms that contain 1,146, 1,007, and
699 amino acids, respectively. NOL6-alpha shares 88% amino acid identity
with mouse Nol6-alpha. Both human and mouse coding regions are GC-rich
and share weak homology to a PAP/25A core domain, which is found in
poly(A) polymerases (605553). NOL6 contains potential nuclear
localization signals and has several potential phosphorylation sites.
Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence studies localized Nol6
expression within the nucleolus in a variety of rodent cell lines,
although expression was not specifically localized to rRNA transcription
sites. Nol6 localized to the condensed chromosomes during mitosis in a
pattern similar to that of B23/nucleophosmin (NPM1; 164040). In situ
hybridization studies in mouse embryos showed ubiquitous Nol6 expression
during development. Immunoblot studies of mouse tissues detected strong
expression in spleen, testis, colon, kidney, stomach, and brain, with
moderate expression in lung, liver, and small intestine, and low
expression in heart and skeletal muscle.

By database analysis, Bernstein et al. (2004) identified NOL6 as the
human ortholog of yeast Utp22. Utp22 is a component of a yeast
ribonucleoprotein required for biogenesis of the 18S rRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Utama et al. (2002) showed that both actinomycin D and RNase treatment
disrupted Nol6 nucleolar localization while cyclohexamide had no effect.
They suggested that Nol6 interacts either directly or indirectly with
the pre-rRNA transcript.

GENE STRUCTURE

Utama et al. (2002) determined that the NOL6 gene contains 26 exons
spanning 11.4 kb. Alternative splicing excludes exons 24 and 25 in
NOL6-beta and skips exons 16 to 25 in the NOL6-gamma isoform.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Utama et al. (2002) mapped the NOL6 gene
to chromosome 9p13.

602366	TITLE *602366 INTEGRIN-LINKED KINASE; ILK
;;p59
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ILK is a serine-threonine protein kinase that associates with the
cytoplasmic domain of beta integrins and acts as a proximal receptor
kinase regulating integrin-mediated signal transduction (Melchior et
al., 2002).

CLONING

Transduction of extracellular matrix signals through integrins
influences intracellular and extracellular functions, and appears to
require interaction of integrin cytoplasmic domains with cellular
proteins. Using a 2-hybrid screen, Hannigan et al. (1996) isolated from
a placenta cDNA library a gene that interacts with the cytoplasmic
domain of beta-1 integrin (135630). The gene, designated integrin-linked
kinase (ILK), encodes a predicted 451-amino acid protein with an
apparent molecular mass of 59 kD based on SDS-PAGE. Northern blot
analysis showed that the 1.8-kb ILK mRNA is widely expressed. The ILK
protein is a serine/threonine protein kinase with 4 ankyrin-like
repeats.

Melchior et al. (2002) cloned the human ILK gene. The deduced 452-amino
acid protein has 4 N-terminal ankyrin repeats, followed by a pleckstrin
homology domain and a C-terminal kinase catalytic domain composed of 11
subdomains.

By immunofluorescence analysis on cryosections of wildtype mouse hearts,
White et al. (2006) detected ILK protein in a pattern consistent with
that of the Z-bands and costameres of cardiomyocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Melchior et al. (2002) determined that the ILK gene contains 13 exons
and spans 9.0 kb. The ATG codon is located within exon 2. Intron 2 is
more than 3.6 kb long and has an Alu-like repeat sequence. The promoter
region has characteristics typical of housekeeping genes, such as high
GC content, the presence of CpG islands, lack of TATA and CAAT boxes,
and the presence of multiple transcription initiation start sites.

MAPPING

Hannigan et al. (1997) mapped the ILK gene to 11p15.5-p15.4 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Hannigan et al. (1996) found that ILK coimmunoprecipitated with beta-1
integrin from cell lysates, and that overexpression of ILK disrupted
cell architecture and inhibited adhesion to integrin substrates, while
inducing anchorage-independent growth in epithelial cells, suggesting
that ILK regulates integrin-mediated signal transduction.

By knockout of the ILK gene in human embryonic kidney cells and mouse
macrophages, Troussard et al. (2003) showed that ILK is essential for
regulation of AKT (see AKT1; 164730) activity. ILK knockout had no
effect on phosphorylation of AKT on thr308, but resulted in almost
complete inhibition of phosphorylation on ser473, causing significant
inhibition of AKT activity accompanied by significant stimulation of
apoptosis. ILK knockout also suppressed phosphorylation of GSK3B
(605004) on ser9 and cyclin D1 (168461) expression. Troussard et al.
(2003) concluded that ILK is an essential upstream regulator of AKT
activation.

Fukuda et al. (2003) found that PINCH1 (LIMS1; 602567) and ILK are
essential for prompt HeLa cell spreading and motility following passage,
and that they are crucial for cell survival. While ILK depletion reduced
AKT phosphorylation on ser473, PINCH1 depletion reduced AKT
phosphorylation on both ser473 and thr308. PINCH1 also regulated ILK
protein levels. Fukuda et al. (2003) concluded that PINCH1 is an
obligate partner of ILK and both are indispensable for proper control of
cell shape change, motility, and survival.

Bock-Marquette et al. (2004) demonstrated that the G-actin sequestering
peptide thymosin beta-4 (300159) promoted myocardial and endothelial
cell migration in the embryonic heart and retained this property in
postnatal cardiomyocytes. Survival of embryonic and postnatal
cardiomyocytes in culture was also enhanced by thymosin beta-4. Thymosin
beta-4 formed a functional complex with PINCH1 and ILK, resulting in
activation of the survival kinase AKT, also known as protein kinase B.
After coronary artery ligation in mice, thymosin beta-4 treatment
resulted in upregulation of Ilk and Akt activity in the heart, enhanced
early myocyte survival, and improved cardiac function. Bock-Marquette et
al. (2004) concluded that thymosin beta-4 promotes cardiomyocyte
migration, survival, and repair.

Lu et al. (2006) demonstrated a marked increase in ILK protein levels in
hypertrophic ventricles of patients with congenital and acquired outflow
tract obstruction. The increase in ILK was associated with the
activation of Rho family guanine triphosphatases, RAC1 (602048) and
CDC42 (116952), and known hypertrophic signaling kinases, including
extracellular signal-related kinases, such as ERK1/2 (see 601795) and
p70-S6-kinase (RPS6KB1; 608938). Transgenic mice with cardiac-specific
expression of a constitutively active or wildtype ILK exhibited a
compensated ventricular hypertrophic phenotype and displayed an
activation profile of guanine triphosphatases and downstream protein
kinases concordant with that seen in human hypertrophy. In contrast,
transgenic mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted expression of a
kinase-inactive ILK were unable to mount a compensatory hypertrophic
response to angiogensin II (see 106150) in vivo. Lu et al. (2006)
concluded that ILK-regulated signaling represents a broadly adaptive
hypertrophic response mechanism relevant to a wide range of clinical
heart disease.

Using a forward genetic screen in zebrafish to identify novel genes
required for myocardial function, Knoll et al. (2007) identified the
lost-contact (loc) mutant, which has a nonsense mutation in the ilk
gene. The loc/ilk mutant is associated with a severe defect in
cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells that leads to severe myocardial
dysfunction.

In primary cultures of human fetal myocardial cells, Traister et al.
(2012) observed that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of ILK potently
increased the number of new aggregates of primitive cardioblasts. The
number of cardioblast colonies was significantly decreased when ILK
expression was knocked down with ILK-targeted siRNA. Overexpression of
an activation-resistant ILK mutant, R211A, resulted in a much greater
increase in the number of new cell aggregates compared to wildtype. The
cardiomyogenic effects of both wildtype and mutant ILK were accompanied
by concurrent activation of beta-catenin (116806) and increased
expression of progenitor cell marker islet-1 (ISL1; 600366), which was
also observed in lysates of transgenic mice with cardiac-specific
overexpression of the R211A mutant and wildtype ILK. Endogenous ILK
expression was shown to increase in concert with those of cardiomyogenic
markers during directed cardiomyogenic differentiation in human
embryonic stem cells. Traister et al. (2012) concluded that ILK
represents a regulatory checkpoint in human cardiomyogenesis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Knoll et al. (2007) sequenced the ILK gene in 192 Caucasian individuals
with severe dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD; see 115200) and identified a
heterozygous missense mutation in 1 patient (A262V; 602366.0001) that
was not found in 712 controls.

ANIMAL MODEL

Sakai et al. (2003) found that embryonic mice lacking Ilk expression
died at the periimplantation stage due to failure of epiblast
polarization and cavitation. The impaired epiblast polarization was
associated with abnormal F-actin accumulation at sites of integrin
attachment to the basement membrane zone. Likewise, Ilk-deficient
fibroblasts showed abnormal F-actin aggregates associated with impaired
cell spreading and delayed formation of stress fibers and focal
adhesions. Ilk-deficient fibroblasts also had diminished proliferation
rates. The proliferation defect was not due to absent or reduced
Ilk-mediated phosphorylation of Akt or Gsk3b. Expression of mutant Ilk
lacking kinase activity and/or paxillin (602505) binding in
Ilk-deficient fibroblasts rescued cell spreading, F-actin organization,
focal adhesion formation, and proliferation.

Friedrich et al. (2004) found that endothelial cell-specific deletion of
Ilk in mice conferred placental insufficiency with decreased
labyrinthine vascularization, and yielded no viable offspring. Deletion
of Ilk in zebrafish resulted in marked patterning abnormalities of the
vasculature and was similarly lethal. Phenotypic rescue of Ilk-deficient
mouse lung endothelial cells with wildtype Ilk, but not by a
constitutively active mutant of Akt, suggested that regulation of
endothelial cell survival by ILK is independent of AKT.

The recessive 'main squeeze' (msq) mutation in zebrafish is embryonic
lethal due to heart failure. Bendig et al. (2006) found that
stretch-responsive genes, such as atrial natriuretic factor (ANF;
108780) and Vegf (192240), were downregulated in msq mutant hearts.
Through positional cloning, they found that heart failure in msq mutants
was due to a point mutation in the Ilk gene. In normal hearts, Ilk
specifically localized to costameres and sarcomeric Z discs. The msq
mutation reduced Ilk kinase activity and disrupted binding of Ilk to the
Z disc adaptor protein beta-parvin (PARVB; 608121). In msq mutant
embryos, heart failure could be suppressed by expression of Ilk or
constitutively active forms of Akt and Vegf. Antisense-mediated
abrogation of zebrafish beta-parvin phenocopied the msq phenotype.

White et al. (2006) performed targeted ablation of Ilk expression in the
mouse heart and observed spontaneous cardiomyopathy and heart failure by
6 weeks of age. The murine symptoms reflected classic human symptoms of
dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD; see 115200), with labored breathing, lack
of strength, and sudden death; postmortem examination revealed grossly
enlarged hearts in all animals, with dramatically dilated left
ventricular chambers and evidence of fibrosis on histology.
Immunofluorescence analysis of frozen heart sections from the mutant
mice revealed loss of Ilk from the sarcolemma, resulting in
disaggregation of adjacent cardiomyocytes within the heart tissue;
trichrome staining confirmed the dramatic disaggregation in mutant mice
compared to the compact arrangement of cardiomyocytes in controls.
Deletion of Ilk was associated with disruption of adhesion signaling
through the beta-1 integrin (135630)/Fak (PTK2; 600758) complex, and
loss of Ilk was accompanied by a reduction in cardiac Akt (164730)
phosphorylation, which normally provides a protective response against
stress. White et al. (2006) suggested that ILK plays a central role in
protecting the mammalian heart against cardiomyopathy and failure.

Lange et al. (2009) showed that mice carrying point mutations in the
proposed autophosphorylation site of the putative kinase domain and in
the pleckstrin homology domain of Ilk are normal. In contrast, mice with
point mutations in the conserved lysine residue of the potential
ATP-binding site of the kinase domain, which mediates Ilk binding to
alpha-parvin (608120), die owing to renal agenesis. Similar renal
defects occur in alpha-parvin-null mice. Lange et al. (2009) concluded
that their results provided genetic evidence that the kinase activity of
Ilk is dispensable for mammalian development; however, an interaction
between Ilk and alpha-parvin is critical for kidney development.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
ILK, ALA262VAL

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to dilated cardiomyopathy (see 115200) has not been
confirmed.

In a Caucasian man with severe dilated cardiomyopathy who had been
diagnosed at 54 years of age and had an ejection fraction of only 25%,
Knoll et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a 785C-T transition in
the ILK gene, resulting in an ala262-to-val (A262V) substitution at a
highly conserved residue in a proline-rich region of the ILK kinase
domain. In vitro kinase assay revealed a 63% reduction in kinase
activity for the A262V variant compared to wildtype.
Immunohistochemistry on a myocardial biopsy sample from the patient
showed a significant loss of endothelial cells.

602130	TITLE *602130 MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 3; MAPKAPK3
;;MAPKAP3;;
MAPKAP KINASE 3;;
3PK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Sithanandam et al. (1996) identified a mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK)-activated protein kinase with a single potential SH3-binding site
in the proline-rich N terminus, a putative ATP-binding site, 2 MAP
kinase phosphorylation site motifs, and a putative nuclear localization
signal. They called the protein 3pK. The gene was cloned from NotI
linking clones and codes for a 2.5-kd mRNA that was expressed in all
human tissues examined, being especially high in the heart and skeletal
muscle. Sequence analysis revealed a 382-amino acid protein of 42 kD. It
shares 72% nucleotide and 75% amino acid identity with MAPKAP kinase-2
(602006). In HL60 cells and transiently transfected HEK293 cells,
activation of 3pK in vivo by the growth inducers serum and tetradecanoyl
phorbol acetate was Raf dependent and was mediated by the Raf/MEK/ERK
kinase cascade.

GENE FUNCTION

Ludwig et al. (1996) showed that 3pK is the first kinase to be activated
through all 3 MAPK cascades: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK;
see 176948), MAPKAP kinase-2, and Jun-N-terminal
kinases/stress-activated protein kinases. They showed also that 3pK has
a novel substrate specificity from other MAPKAPs. Thus, Ludwig et al.
(1996) concluded that 3pK functions as an integrative element of
signaling in both mitogen and stress responses.

Maizels et al. (2001) investigated the activation in vivo and regulation
of the expression of components of the p38 MAPK (600289) pathway during
gonadotropin-induced formation and development of the rat corpus luteum.
They postulated that the p38 MAPK pathway could serve to promote
phosphorylation of key substrates during luteal maturation, since
maturing luteal cells, thought to be cAMP-nonresponsive, nevertheless
maintain critical phosphoproteins. The p38 MAPK downstream protein
kinase target MAPKAPK3 was newly induced at both mRNA and protein levels
during luteal formation and maturation, while mRNA and protein
expression of the closely related MAPKAPK2 diminished. MAPKAPK3-specific
immune complex kinase assays provided direct evidence that MAPKAPK3 was
in an activated state during luteal maturation in vivo. Transient
transfection studies provided direct evidence that MAPKAPK3 was capable
of signaling to activate CREB (123810) transcriptional activity, as
assessed by means of GAL4-CREB fusion protein construct coexpressed with
GAL4-luciferase reporter construct. Introduction of wildtype, but not
kinase-dead mutant, MAPKAPK3 cDNA, into a mouse ovarian cell line
stimulated GAL4-CREB-dependent transcriptional activity approximately
3-fold. Maizels et al. (2001) concluded that MAPKAPK3 is uniquely poised
to support luteal maturation through the phosphorylation and activation
of the nuclear transcription factor CREB.

GENE STRUCTURE

Maizels et al. (2001) determined that the MAPKAPK3 gene contains 10
exons.

MAPPING

Maizels et al. (2001) mapped the MAPKAPK3 gene to chromosome 3p21.3.

602441	TITLE *602441 CYTOKINE-INDUCIBLE SH2-CONTAINING PROTEIN; CISH
;;CIS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CIS belongs to the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family (see
SOCS1; 603597) and is an important negative regulator for inflammatory
signaling (Hu et al., 2009).

CLONING

As part of the search for immediate-early cytokine-responsive genes,
Yoshimura et al. (1995) cloned murine Cish, which was shown to have a
growth inhibitory function. Cis, the protein product of Cish, has an Src
homology 2 (SH2) domain in the middle of its sole structural motif.

Uchida et al. (1997) isolated a human CISH cDNA. The CISH protein
consists of 258 amino acids. Northern blot analysis showed expression of
CISH as a 2-kb transcript in various epithelial tissues, including lung
and kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Hu et al. (2009) noted that microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in
the fine tuning of the Toll-like receptor (TLR; see 603030)-mediated
inflammatory response. Using Northern and Western blot analyses and PCR
with human cholangiocytes, which express multiple TLRs, Hu et al. (2009)
showed that the miRNAs MIR98 (300810) and LET7 (see MIRNLET7A1; 605386)
regulated CIS protein expression via translational suppression. CIS
expression was upregulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or
Cryptosporidium parvum exposure, and this upregulation involved
downregulation of MIR98 and LET7, which relieved MIR98- and
LET7-mediated translational repression of CIS. Gain- and
loss-of-function studies showed that CIS accelerated degradation of IKBA
(NFKBIA; 164008) and enhanced NFKB (see 164011) activation in
cholangiocytes in response to LPS stimulation or C. parvum exposure. Hu
et al. (2009) proposed that LET7 and MIR98 allow expression of CIS in
response to microbial challenge.

GENE STRUCTURE

Uchida et al. (1997) determined that the CISH gene contains 2 introns,
about 3 kb and 0.4 kb in size, and has 3 repeats of the pentameric mRNA
destabilization signal, ATTTA, in its 3-prime UTR.

MAPPING

Uchida et al. (1997) mapped the human CISH gene to chromosome 3p21.3 by
FISH. The mouse gene is tightly linked to the Gnai2 gene (139360) on
chromosome 9, a region syntenic to human chromosome 3p21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Khor et al. (2010) used a case-control design to test for an association
between CISH polymorphisms and susceptibility to major infectious
diseases, including bacteremia, tuberculosis (607948), and severe
malaria (611162), in blood samples from 8,402 persons from Gambia, Hong
Kong, Kenya, Malawi, and Vietnam. The others had previously tested 20
other immune-related genes in 1 or more of these sample collections.
Khor et al. (2010) observed associations between variant alleles of
multiple CISH polymorphisms and increased susceptibility to each
infectious disease in each of the study populations. When all 5 SNPs, at
positions -639, -292 (dbSNP rs414171; 602441.0001), -163 (dbSNP
rs6768330), +1320 (dbSNP rs2239751), and +3415 (dbSNP rs622502), within
the CISH-associated locus were considered together in a multiple-SNP
score, Khor et al. (2010) found an association between CISH genetic
variants and susceptibility to bacteremia, malaria, and tuberculosis (P
= 3.8 x 10(-11) for all comparisons), and with -292 accounting for most
of the association signal (P = 4.58 x 10(-7)). Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from adult subjects carrying the -292
variant, as compared with wildtype cells, showed a muted response to the
stimulation of interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) production, i.e., 25 to 40%
less CISH expression. Khor et al. (2010) found that the overall risk of
one of these infectious diseases was increased by at least 18% among
persons carrying the variant CISH alleles.

In a case-control study testing for association between CISH
polymorphisms and susceptibility to major infectious diseases involving
8,402 individuals from Gambia, Hong Kong, Keyna, Malawi, and Vietnam,
Khor et al. (2010) found that dbSNP rs414171 at the -292 position
relative to the CISH gene results in increased susceptibility to
tuberculosis (607948), malaria (611162), and invasive bacterial disease
(BACTS2; 614383) (p = 4.58 x -10(-7)). In addition, peripheral blood
mononuclear cells obtained from adult subjects carrying the -292
variant, as compared with wildtype cells, showed a muted response to the
stimulation of interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680), i.e., 25 to 40% less CISH
expression.

607431	TITLE *607431 DAZ-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; DAZAP2
;;KIAA0058
DESCRIPTION Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human testis cDNA library with the
coding region of DAZ (400003) as bait, Tsui et al. (2000) cloned 2 novel
cDNAs, which they designated DAZAP1 (607430) and DAZAP2, encoding
proteins of 407 and 167 amino acids, respectively. Northern blot
analysis detected ubiquitous, low-level expression of a 2.2-kb DAZAP2
transcript.

GENE FUNCTION

Using GST-fusion binding analysis, Tsui et al. (2000) determined that
both DAZAP1 and DAZAP2 interact with DAZ and DAZL (601486). Deletion
constructs indicated that DAZ and DAZL bind to DAZAP1/DAZAP2 mainly
through the DAZ repeat region.

MAPPING

By FISH, Tsui et al. (2000) mapped the DAZAP2 gene to chromosome
2q33-q34.

MYOTONIC DYSTROPHY KINASE-RELATED CDC42-BINDING KINASE, BETA; MRCKB;;

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using CDC42 (116952) as bait in an expression screen of a human brain
cDNA library, Leung et al. (1998) obtained a partial cDNA for CDC42BPB,
which they designated MRCK-beta. They obtained full-length cDNAs
encoding Mrck-beta and a related protein, Mrck-alpha (CDC42BPA; 603412),
from a rat cDNA library. The deduced rat Mrck-alpha and Mrck-beta
proteins contain 1,732 and 1,702 amino acids, respectively. Both have an
N-terminal kinase domain, followed by a central coiled-coil region, a
cysteine-rich region, a pleckstrin (PLEK; 173570) homology (PH) domain,
and a C-terminal p21 GTPase (see HRAS; 190020)-binding domain. Northern
blot analysis detected Mrck-beta expression in all rat tissues examined,
with highest expression in kidney and lung. Expression of MRCK-alpha and
MRCK-beta was also detected in HeLa cells.

By RT-PCR walking, Moncrieff et al. (1999) cloned full-length human
CDC42BPB from human fetal brain mRNA. The deduced protein contains 1,711
amino acids. It shares 90% amino acid identity and conservation of
domain structure with rat Cdc42bpb. Northern blot analysis detected a
major 7-kb transcript in all human tissues examined, with highest
expression in heart, brain, and placenta.

GENE FUNCTION

Ng et al. (2004) showed that the isolated kinase inhibitory motif of
MRCK-gamma (CDC42BPG; 613991) bound the kinase domains of MRCK-alpha and
MRCK-beta and inhibited their catalytic activities.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Huo et al. (2011) found that MRCK-beta
bound to the C-terminal ZU5 domain of ZO1 (TJP1; 601009). The
interaction likely caused a conformational change in the ZU5 domain.
Cotransfection of MRCK-beta and ZO1 led to prominent colocalization of
the 2 proteins at the leading edge of COS-7 cells. Mutation analysis
showed that the ZU5 domain of ZO1 was required for targeting of
MRCK-beta to the leading edge. Formation of the ZO1-MRCK-beta complex
required priming of MRCK-beta by CDC42. Disruption of the ZO1/MRCK-beta
complex inhibited MRCK-beta-mediated cell migration.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Moncrieff et al. (1999) mapped
the CDC42BPB gene to chromosome 14q32.3.

;;TONICITY-RESPONSIVE ENHANCER-BINDING PROTEIN; TONEBP;;
NFAT-LIKE PROTEIN 1; NFATL1;;
KIAA0827
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tonicity-responsive enhancers (TonEs) in kidney medulla cells play a key
role in hypertonicity-induced transcriptional stimulation of
sodium/myoinositol cotransporter (SLC5A3; 600444),
sodium/chloride/betaine cotransporter (SLC6A12; 603080), and aldose
reductase (AKR1B1; 103880). Using a yeast 1-hybrid strategy followed by
screening of a HeLa cDNA library, Miyakawa et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA
encoding NFAT5, which they called TONEBP (TonE-binding protein). By
searching an EST database for sequences related to NFATC family members
(e.g., NFATC1; 600489), Lopez-Rodriguez et al. (1999) also isolated a
cDNA encoding NFAT5. The 1,455-amino acid NFAT5 protein contains a
region near the N terminus that has high homology to the Rel-like
DNA-binding domain of the NFATC family. However, NFAT5 lacks the
N-terminal sequence that functions as an interface for calcineurin (see
114105) and regulatory kinases. Northern blot analysis detected an
approximately 13-kb NFAT5 transcript that was ubiquitously expressed. By
electrophoretic mobility shift analyses, Miyakawa et al. (1999) showed
that the NFAT5 Rel region binds to TonE DNA, and Lopez-Rodriguez et al.
(1999) showed that it binds to sequences similar to those preferred by
NFATC1, but not to FOS (164810) or JUN (165160). Western blot analysis
detected expression of a 200-kD NFAT5 protein in a kidney cell line
(Lopez-Rodriguez et al., 1999). By immunostaining, Miyakawa et al.
(1999) showed that NFAT5 is present in both cytoplasm and nucleus of
isotonic kidney cells, but is found predominantly in the nucleus of
cells cultured in hypertonic medium; Lopez-Rodriguez et al. (1999)
detected staining only in the nucleus of resting and stimulated T
lymphocytes, HeLa cells, and myoblast cells.

By Western blot analysis of mouse tissue, Trama et al. (2000) detected
abundant expression of NFAT5, which they termed NFATL1, in thymus, with
much lower amounts in testis, lung, and brain, and no expression in
other tissues, including lymph nodes. Stimulated mouse splenocytes
expressed NFAT5, whereas quiescent mouse splenocytes and T cells exposed
to cyclosporin A or FK506 did not. Reporter gene analysis showed that
T-cell receptor cross-linking resulted in the induction of NFAT5 in
human Jurkat cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Jauliac et al. (2002) found that both NFATC2 (600490) and NFAT5 were
expressed in invasive human ductal breast carcinomas. Using cell lines
derived from breast and colon carcinomas, they found that these NFATs
promoted carcinoma invasion and that their activity correlated with
expression of alpha-6 (147556)/beta-4 (147557) integrin. The
transcriptional activity of NFAT5 was induced by alpha-6/beta-4
clustering in the presence of chemoattractants, resulting in enhanced
cell migration. Jauliac et al. (2002) determined that the activity of
NFAT5 required an intact beta-4 cytoplasmic tail.

In studies in rats, Machnik et al. (2009) demonstrated that TONEBP-VEGFC
(601528) signaling in mononuclear phagocytes is a major determinant of
extracellular volume and blood pressure homeostasis, and is intimately
involved in salt-induced hypertension (see 145500).

Kleinewietfeld et al. (2013) demonstrated that increased salt
concentrations found locally under physiologic conditions in vivo
markedly boost the induction of murine and human T(H)17 cells. High-salt
conditions activated the p38/MAPK (600289) pathway involving NFAT5 and
serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase-1 (SGK1; 602958) during
cytokine-induced T(H)17 polarization. Gene silencing or chemical
inhibition of p38/MAPK, NFAT5, or SGK1 abrogated the high-salt-induced
T(H)17 cell development. The T(H)17 cells generated under high-salt
conditions displayed a highly pathogenic and stable phenotype
characterized by the upregulation of the proinflammatory cytokines GMCSF
(138960), TNF-alpha (191160), and IL2 (147680). Moreover, mice fed with
a high-salt diet developed a more severe form of autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE), in line with augmented central nervous system
infiltrating and peripherally induced antigen-specific T(H)17 cells.
Thus, Kleinewietfeld et al. (2013) suggested that increased dietary salt
intake might represent an environmental risk factor for the development
of autoimmune diseases through the induction of pathogenic T(H)17 cells.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the NFAT5
gene, which they called KIAA0827, to chromosome 16. Hebinck et al.
(2000) mapped the NFAT5 gene to chromosome 16q22.1 by FISH and radiation
hybrid analysis. Using the latter method, they mapped the mouse homolog
to chromosome 8D.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lopez-Rodriguez et al. (2004) found that homozygous Nfat5-deficient mice
were genetically underrepresented after embryonic day 14.5. Surviving
mice manifested a progressive and profound atrophy of the kidney medulla
with impaired activation of several osmoprotective genes, including
Akr1b1, Slc6a12, and Slc5a3. The Akr1b1 gene is controlled by a
tonicity-responsive enhancer, which was refractory to hypertonic stress
in fibroblasts lacking Nfat5, establishing this enhancer as a direct
transcriptional target of NFAT5. Lopez-Rodriguez et al. (2004) concluded
that NFAT5 is a tonicity-responsive transcription factor with a central
role in kidney homeostasis and function.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ku et al. (1991) cloned a growth-regulated cDNA by differential
screening of a mouse 3T3 cell line library to identify transcripts
induced by serum stimulation. Transcripts of the gene, designated SC1,
were detectable beginning at about 8 hours after stimulation. The mouse
cDNA was used to clone the human SC1 cDNA. The 2.6-kb cDNA encoded a
deduced 359-amino acid polypeptide with features characteristic of
transactivating factors. The gene was mapped by in situ hybridization to
chromosome 6p21-p22. The bacterially expressed protein had the predicted
size of 39 kD.

MAPPING

Krishnan et al. (1995) mapped TCF19 with POU5F1 (164177) to a 0.2-Mb
region between HLA-C (142840) and the so-called S gene (602593) at
6p21.3. POU5F1 and TCF19 are about 130 kb telomeric of HLAC and about

;;CHRNA;;
ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR, MUSCLE, ALPHA SUBUNIT; ACHRA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The acetylcholine receptor of muscle, like the nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor of the Torpedo electric organ, has 5 subunits of 4 different
types: 2 alpha and 1 each of beta, gamma, and delta subunits. In the
electric organ the subunits show conspicuous sequence homology. The
transmembrane topology of the subunits and the location of functionally
important regions, such as the acetylcholine-binding site and the
transmembrane segments involved in the ionic channel, have been
proposed.

CLONING

Noda et al. (1983) cloned cDNA for the alpha subunit precursor of the
calf skeletal muscle AChR and a human genomic DNA segment containing the
CHRNA1 gene. Nucleotide sequences showed marked homology with the
counterpart of Torpedo sp. (electric ray).

Analyzing acetylcholine receptor clones isolated from a human leg muscle
cDNA library, Beeson et al. (1990) found that the alpha subunit exists
in 2 isoforms. A novel 75-nucleotide exon P3A, between exons 3 and 4,
results in the insertion of 25 amino acids into the alpha subunit,
giving the new isoform 462 amino acids. The transcript lacking P3A
(P3A-) encodes a functional subunit, whereas the transcript containing
P3A (P3A+) encodes a nonfunctional subunit. The P3A- and P3A+
transcripts are generated in a 1:1 ratio in human muscle (Masuda et al.,
2008).

Schoepfer et al. (1988) showed that a human medulloblastoma cell line
expressed a muscle type rather than a neuronal type of acetylcholine
receptor. They succeeded in isolating cDNA clones for the alpha subunit
and suggested that these should be useful in obtaining large amounts of
human muscle-type acetylcholine receptor alpha-subunit protein for
studies of the autoimmune response in myasthenia gravis (see 601462).

Keiger et al. (2003) surveyed the developmental expression of nicotinic
receptors, including CHRNA1, in chick and human spinal cord.

GENE STRUCTURE

The protein-coding sequence of the human ACHRA gene is divided into 9
exons that correspond to different structural and functional domains of
the precursor molecule (Noda et al., 1983).

Beeson et al. (1990) identified the exon P3A and found that CHNRA1 gene
is alternatively spliced. Masuda et al. (2008) found that a -8G
nucleotide in intron 3 is an essential nucleotide of an intronic
splicing silencer (ISS) that markedly decreases recognition of exon P3A
by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H (HNRPH1; 601035).
They showed that hnRNP H is the transfactor that normally binds to this
ISS and suppresses expression of P3A.

MAPPING

By means of somatic cell hybridization, Beeson et al. (1989, 1990)
assigned the CHRNA gene to chromosome 2; by in situ hybridization, they
regionalized the gene to 2q24-q32, with the major peak of grains being
at 2q32. By linkage analysis, Lobos (1993) placed the CHRNA gene about
27 cM proximal to the crystallin G pseudogene marker, CRYGP1, located at
2q33-q35; the CHRND (100720) and CHRNG (100730) loci were placed about
31 cM distal to CRYGP1.

Heidmann et al. (1986) mapped the mouse alpha subunit gene to chromosome
17, but Taylor and Rowe (1989) determined that the mouse Chrna1 gene is
in fact located on chromosome 2.

GENE FUNCTION

Giraud et al. (2007) described a mechanism controlling thymic
transcription of a prototypic tissue-restricted human autoantigen gene,
CHRNA1. This gene encodes the alpha subunit of the muscle acetylcholine
receptor, which is the main target of pathogenic autoantibodies in
autoimmune myasthenia gravis (254200). On resequencing the CHRNA1 gene,
Giraud et al. (2007) identified a functional biallelic variant in the
promoter that was associated with early onset of disease in 2
independent human populations (France and U.K.). The authors showed that
this variant prevented binding of interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF8;
601565) and abrogated CHRNA1 promoter activity in thymic epithelial
cells in vitro. Notably, both the CHRNA1 promoter variant and AIRE
(607358) modulated CHRNA1 mRNA levels in human medullary thymic
epithelial cells ex vivo and also in a transactivation assay. Giraud et
al. (2007) concluded that their findings revealed a critical function of
AIRE and the interferon signaling pathway in regulating quantitative
expression of this autoantigen in the thymus, suggesting that together
they set the threshold for self-tolerance versus autoimmunity.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

By recording images at liquid-helium temperatures and applying a
computational method to correct for distortions, Miyazawa et al. (2003)
reported the crystal structure of the acetylcholine receptor of the
Torpedo electric ray at a resolution of 4 angstroms. The pore is shaped
by an inner ring of 5 alpha helices, which curve radially to create a
tapering path for the ions, and an outer ring of 15 alpha helices, which
coil around each other and shield the inner ring from the lipids. The
gate is a constricting hydrophobic girdle at the middle of a lipid
bilayer, formed by weak interactions between neighboring inner helices.
When acetylcholine enters the ligand-binding domain, it triggers
rotations of the protein chains on opposite sides of the entrance to the
pore. These rotations are communicated through the inner helices and
open the pore by breaking the girdle apart.

Lape et al. (2008) investigated partial agonists for 2 members of the
nicotinic superfamily, the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and
the glycine receptor (138491), and found that the open-shut reaction is
similar for both full and partial agonists, but the response to partial
agonists is limited by an earlier conformation change (flipping) that
takes place when the channel is still shut. Lape et al. (2008) suggested
that their observations have implications for the interpretation of
structural studies and for the design of partial agonists for
therapeutic use.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Myasthenia Gravis

Garchon et al. (1994) identified 2 stable polymorphic dinucleotide
repeats within the first intron of the CHRNA gene, designated HB and BB.
They found that the HB*14 allele conferred a relative risk for
myasthenia gravis (254200) of 2.5 in 81 unrelated patients compared with
100 control subjects. Very significantly, family analysis based on
haplotype segregation data indicated that parental haplotypes associated
with HB*14 always segregated to the child with myasthenia gravis,
whereas their transmission to unaffected sibs was as expected ('was
equilibrated,' in the words of the authors). Myasthenia gravis patients
always showed a high frequency of microsatellite variants not seen in
controls.

Giraud et al. (2007) found that the minor allele G of dbSNP rs16862847
was associated with early onset of disease in French and U.K. myasthenia
gravis patients in a combined sample of 96 patients in the lower
quartile of the age distribution versus 234 patients in the upper 3
quartiles of the age distribution and 260 controls (odds ratio = 2.19,
95% confidence interval 1.41 to 3.39, P = 0.00048). For heterozygotes
plus homozygotes for the G allele versus homozygotes for the A allele,
the odds ratio for early onset of myasthenia gravis was 2.66 (95%
confidence interval 1.6 to 4.41, P = 0.00015).

- Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes

In a patient with slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome (601462),
Engel et al. (1996) identified a heterozygous mutation in the CHRNA1
gene (100690.0001).

In 2 sibs with fast-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome (608930),
Wang et al. (1999) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in
the CHRNA gene (100690.0007; 100690.0008).

- Lethal Multiple Pterygium Syndrome

Michalk et al. (2008) reported 2 families in which homozygous nonsense
mutations in CHRNA1 (e.g., 100690.0013) caused lethal multiple pterygium
syndrome (253290).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, ASN217LYS

In a 30-year-old woman with slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome
(601462), Engel et al. (1996) identified a heterozygous 651C-G
transversion in exon 6 of the CHRNA1 gene, resulting in an asn217-to-lys
(N217K) substitution at a conserved residue in the M1 transmembrane
domain. The mutation cosegregated with the disease through 3
generations. Functional expression studies showed that the N217K
mutation slowed the rate of AChR channel closure, increased the apparent
affinity for ACh, and enhanced desensitization. Cationic overload of the
postsynaptic region caused an endplate myopathy.

.0002
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, VAL156MET

In a patient with SCCMS (601462), Croxen et al. (1997) identified a
heterozygous 466G-A transition in the CHRNA1 gene, resulting in a
val156-to-met (V156M) substitution in a putative ACh-binding region of
the protein. Functional studies suggested that the V156M mutation
stabilizes the open state of the AChR channel.

.0003
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, THR254ILE

In a 60-year-old woman whose myasthenic syndrome (SCCMS; 601462) had
first become symptomatic at the age of 16, Croxen et al. (1997)
identified a heterozygous 761C-T transition in the CHRNA1 gene,
resulting in a thr254-to-ile (T254I) substitution in the M2
transmembrane domain which lines the AChR channel pore. The patient was
previously reported by Chauplannaz and Bady (1994). Functional
expression studies suggested that the T254I mutation stabilized the open
state of the AChR channel.

.0004
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, GLY153SER

In 5 members of a family and another unrelated person affected by a
slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome (601462), Sine et al. (1995)
identified a heterozygous 457G-A transition in the CHRNA1 gene,
resulting in a gly153-to-ser (G153S) substitution in the extracellular
domain of the subunit. Electrophysiologic analysis of endplates revealed
prolonged decay of miniature endplate currents and prolonged activation
episodes of single AChR channels. Single-channel kinetic analysis of
engineered alpha-G153S AChR showed a markedly decreased rate of
acetylcholine dissociation, indicating an increased affinity for ACh,
causing the mutant AChR to open repeatedly during ACh occupancy. In
addition, ACh binding measurements combined with the kinetic analysis
indicated increased desensitization of the mutant AChR. Sine et al.
(1995) concluded that ACh binding affinity can dictate the time course
of the synaptic response.

Croxen et al. (1997) identified the G153S mutation in a 41-year-old
woman with SCCMS and her affected mother. Both patients were previously
reported by Chauplannaz and Bady (1994). The G153S substitution resides
in the putative ACh-binding domain of the protein, and functional
expression studies suggested that the G153S mutation impedes
dissociation of ACh from the AChR.

.0005
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, SER269ILE

In a 28-year-old woman who first developed symptoms of SCCMS (601462) in
the eighth month of her first pregnancy (Oosterhuis et al., 1987),
Croxen et al. (1997) identified an 806G-T transversion in the CHRNA1
gene, resulting in a ser269-to-ile (S269I) substitution. The mutation
lies within the short extracellular sequence between M2 and M3
transmembrane domains of the protein.

.0006
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, VAL249PHE

In a patient with a severe form of SCCMS (601462), Milone et al. (1997)
identified a heterozygous 745G-T transversion in exon 7 of the CHRNA1
gene, resulting in a val249-to-phe (V249F) substitution in the M2
transmembrane domain of the protein that does not face the channel
lumen. The patient's unaffected father was a mosaic for the mutation.
Functional expression studies showed that the V249F mutation causes
increased channel opening in the absence of ACh, prolonged opening in
the presence of ACh, increased affinity for ACh, and enhanced
desensitization. The findings indicated that the structure of the M2
domain is essential for correct stabilization of functional channel
states and that mutation in this region results in multiple functional
defects.

.0007
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, FAST-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, VAL285ILE

In 2 sibs with fast-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome (608930),
Wang et al. (1999) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in
the CHRNA gene. The functional mutation was an 853G-A transition in exon
7, resulting in a val285-to-ile (V285I) substitution in the upper third
of the M3 transmembrane domain. The other mutation was a 697T-G
transversion in exon 6, resulting in a phe233-to-val substitution
(F233V; 100690.0008) in the M1 transmembrane domain, causing markedly
reduced protein expression; this was essentially a null mutation.
Functional expression studies showed that the V285I mutation reduced the
amplitude of the miniature endplate current (MEPC), accelerated the
decay of the MEPC, and reduced total current flow through the AChR
channel. Kinetic analysis showed abnormally slow channel opening and
rapid closing, resulting in an abnormally brief current.

See 100690.0007 and Wang et al. (1999).

.0009
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, FAST-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, PHE256LEU

In a patient with fast-channel CMS (608930) originally reported by
Vincent et al. (1981), Webster et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous
766T-C transition in exon 7 of the CHRNA1 gene, resulting in a
phe256-to-leu (F256L) substitution in the M2 transmembrane domain of the
protein. Functional expression studies showed that the F256L mutation
results in fewer and shorter ion channel activations, with a decreased
channel opening rate and an increased channel closing rate. The
patient's mildly affected father also had the F256L mutation. Webster et
al. (2004) noted that autosomal dominant inheritance of fast-channel CMS
is rare.

.0010
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, FAST-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, VAL132LEU

In a girl with severe fast-channel CMS (608930), Shen et al. (2003)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the CHRNA1 gene: a
frameshifting null mutation (381delC; 100690.0011), and a 394G-C
transversion, resulting in a val132-to-leu (V132L) substitution, in a
highly conserved cys-loop at the junction between the extracellular
ligand-binding and transmembrane domains of the protein. Functional
kinetic expression studies showed that channels with the V132L mutation
had an increased dissociation constant for ACh, shorter burst duration,
and resistance to desensitization, culminating in a reduced probability
of channel opening over a range of ACh concentrations. The mutant
channel showed an approximately 30-fold decrease of ACh binding affinity
for the second of 2 closed-state binding sites, but only a 2-fold
decrease in gating efficiency. Mutations corresponding to the val132
residue in other AChR subunits showed different effects, indicating
functional asymmetry between cys-loops of the different subunits.

MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, CYS418TRP

In a 27-year-old man with congenital slow-channel myasthenic syndrome
(601462) and mild symptoms since birth, Shen et al. (2006) identified a
de novo heterozygous 1362C-G transversion in the CHRNA1 gene, resulting
in a cys418-to-trp (C418W) substitution in the M4 domain of the protein.
This residue is highly conserved across AChR-alpha subunits of different
species but not across individual subunits. Functional kinetic
expression studies in HEK cells showed that the AChR with the mutant
alpha-subunit increased the channel opening equilibrium and the mean
duration of open durations and bursts characteristic of a slow-channel
mutation. The C418W mutant subunit increased the rate of channel opening
and slowed the rate of channel closing, but had no effect on agonist
binding. Shen et al. (2006) used a check plasmid as a screening tool to
identify a specific siRNA that suppressed the mutant, but not the
wildtype allele, at the mRNA, protein, and functional levels in vitro.

.0013
MULTIPLE PTERYGIUM SYNDROME, LETHAL TYPE
CHRNA1, ARG254LEU

In a consanguineous Pakistani family, Michalk et al. (2008) demonstrated
that multiple pterygium syndrome (253290) was caused by homozygosity for
a G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 761 in exon 6 of the CHRNA1 gene
that resulted in an arg234-to-leu (R234L) substitution in the mature
protein (R254L in the precursor).

.0014
MULTIPLE PTERYGIUM SYNDROME, LETHAL TYPE
CHRNA1, 17-BP DUP, NT117

In a nonconsanguineous African family, Michalk et al. (2008) found that
multiple pterygium syndrome (253290) was caused by homozygous
duplication of 17 basepairs in exon 2 of the CHRNA1 gene, 117-133dup17,
that resulted in frameshift and subsequent premature protein termination
(H24RfsX19; H45RfsX19 in the precursor).

.0015
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, FAST-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, IVS3AS, G-A, -8

In a woman with autosomal recessive inheritance of fast-channel
congenital myasthenic syndrome (608930), Masuda et al. (2008) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the CHRNA1 gene: a G-to-A
transition in intron 3 (IVS3-8G-A) and a 937C-T transition in exon 7,
resulting in an arg313-to-trp (R313W; 100690.0016) substitution in a
highly conserved residue. Neither mutation was found in 200 control
alleles. Functional expression studies in HEK cells showed decreased
expression of the R313W mutant, which showed mild fast-channel
properties. The -8G-A transition occurred just before exon P3A, and
disrupted an intronic splicing silencer (ISS) sequence, resulting in the
inclusion of exon P3A and yielding a nonfunctional protein.

607298	TITLE *607298 GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING PROTEIN, GAMMA-13; GNG13
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heterotrimeric G proteins, which consist of alpha (see 139320), beta
(see 139380), and gamma subunits, function as signal transducers for the
7-transmembrane-helix G protein-coupled receptors. GNG13 is a gamma
subunit that is expressed in taste, retinal, and neuronal tissues and
plays a key role in taste transduction (Li et al., 2006).

CLONING

Huang et al. (1999) identified and cloned mouse Gng13 through its
interaction with alpha-gustducin (139395). By genomic sequence analysis,
they identified a human EST containing GNG13. The deduced 67-amino acid
GNG13 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 7.9 kD and shares about
96% sequence identity with mouse Gng13. Northern blot analysis of
several human tissues revealed a 1.2-kb transcript expressed strongly in
brain and weakly in small intestine and thymus. Low-level expression of
a 6.2-kb transcript was also seen in brain. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected a 0.5-kb transcript in brain, retina, and
olfactory epithelium, with lower expression in stomach and testis.
Transcripts of 2.1 and 4.8 kb were also detected in olfactory epithelium
and cerebellum. In situ hybridization of mouse circumvallate papillae
showed expression in taste receptor cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Huang et al. (1999) found that of 19 mouse taste receptor cells
expressing both alpha-gustducin and Gng13, all also expressed the
G-protein beta-3 subunit (GNB3; 139130), and 80% also expressed the
beta-1 subunit (GNB1; 139380). They determined that alpha-gustducin,
Gnb1, and Gng13 formed a heterotrimeric G protein capable of interacting
with receptors responsive to the bitter compound denatonium. Both
denatonium and a sucrose derivative caused the rapid generation of
inositol triphosphate in murine taste tissue. The denatonium response
depended upon a phospholipase C-beta-2 (PLCB2; 604114) isotype
specifically expressed in taste receptor cells, and the response could
be blocked by antibodies against Gng13.

Vertebrate retinas have distinct light-on (ON) and light-off (OFF)
channels that originate at the level of the retinal bipolar cells. For
the conversion from OFF to ON, ON bipolar cells use the GNAO1
(139311)-coupled glutamate receptor-6 (GRIK2; 138244) such that binding
of glutamate suppresses a cation current rather than activating it.
Using immunohistochemical analysis and single-cell PCR, Huang et al.
(2003) showed that Gng13 was coexpressed with the beta subunits Gnb3 and
Gnb4 (610863), but no other beta subunits, in dissociated mouse ON
bipolar cells. Huang et al. (2003) hypothesized that these G protein
subunits selectively participate in signal transduction in ON bipolar
cells.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse brain cDNA library, Li et al.
(2006) found that Gng13 interacted with Psd95 (DLG4; 602887) and Veli2
(LIN7B; 612331). Gng13 interacted specifically with the third PDZ domain
of Psd95 and the single PDZ domain of Veli2. Gng13 also interacted with
the third PDZ domain of Sap97 (DLG1; 601014). The C-terminal CAAX tail
of Gng13 was required for its interaction with Psd95. Coexpression of
Gng13 with Gnb1 did not interfere with these interactions. Protein
pull-down assays confirmed interaction of endogenous Gng13 with Psd95
and Sap97 in mouse brain and taste tissue, respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Huang et al. (1999) determined that the GNG13 gene contains 3 exons and
spans more than 2.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Huang et al. (1999) mapped the GNG13 gene
to chromosome 16p13.3.

607560	TITLE *607560 RHO GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTOR 2; ARHGEF2
;;GEFH1;;
KIAA0651
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Rho (see RhoA; 165390)-related small GTPases are involved in regulating
signal transduction cascades from extracellular stimuli to the cell
nucleus and cytoskeleton. DBL (311030)-like guanine nucleotide exchange
factors (GEFs), such as ARHGEF2, catalyze the exchange of bound GDP for
GTP on Rho-related proteins.

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1998) cloned ARHGEF2, which they designated
KIAA0651. The deduced protein contains 910 amino acids. RT-PCR detected
expression of ARHGEF2 in all tissues examined.

Reddy et al. (1989) identified a partial clone of ARHGEF2 as a regulator
of proliferation in Hep-2 cells. By screening a HeLa cell cDNA library
with this clone, followed by 5-prime RACE, Ren et al. (1998) obtained a
full-length cDNA encoding ARHGEF2, which they designated GEFH1. The
deduced protein contains 894 amino acids and has a calculated molecular
mass of 100 kD. ARHGEF2 has an N-terminal zinc finger-like motif,
followed by a DBL homology domain, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a
C-terminal coiled-coil domain. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb
transcript in all tissues tested, with highest expression in thymus,
testis, and leukocytes.

Krendel et al. (2002) determined that the full-length ARHGEF2 protein
contains 985 amino acids. They concluded that KIAA0651 likely represents
a splice variant that differs from the full-length sequence by the
absence of the N-terminal zinc finger motif.

GENE FUNCTION

Ren et al. (1998) determined that recombinant GEFH1 could stimulate the
dissociation of radiolabeled GDP from RhoA. By screening a panel of
small G proteins, they found that GEFH1 was a GEF for RhoA, RhoB
(165370), RhoC (165380), and RAC1 (602048). Further characterization
revealed that GEFH1 bound Rho and Rac when these G proteins were in
either the GDP- or GTP-bound state. GEFH1 transfected into COS-7 or NIH
3T3 cells showed a filamentous distribution that colocalized with
tubulin (see 191130). Mutation of the C-terminal coiled-coil region
caused redistribution of GEFH1 to a cytoplasmic punctate distribution.
Overexpression of GEFH1 in COS-7 cells resulted in induction of large
membrane ruffles, similar to the effect observed when a constitutively
active form of Rac was expressed.

Krendel et al. (2002) determined that KIAA0651, a splice variant of
GEFH1 lacking the N-terminal zinc finger motif, did not localize to
microtubules. The full-length protein containing a point mutation (cys53
to arg) in the zinc finger, as well as N- and C-terminally truncated
GEFH1 proteins, also lost microtubule localization. However, none of
these variants affected microtubule stability. These variants did,
however, show higher GEF activity than the microtubule-bound forms, and
they induced Rho-dependent changes in cell morphology and actin
organization. Krendel et al. (2002) concluded that both the N- and
C-terminal motifs mediate microtubule localization of GEFH1, and that
GEFH1 links changes in microtubule integrity to Rho-dependent regulation
of the actin cytoskeleton.

Zenke et al. (2004) identified a region in the C terminus of GEFH1 that
is important for the suppression of its guanine nucleotide exchange
activity by microtubules. This region has a coiled-coil motif, a
proline-rich motif that may interact with SH3 domain-containing
proteins, and a potential binding site for 14-3-3 proteins (see YWHAH;
113508). Zenke et al. (2004) also showed that ser885 within the
14-3-3-binding site is a phosphorylation site for PAK1 (602590), an
effector of RAC and CDC42 (116952) GTPases. PAK1 phosphorylation of
GEFH1 at ser885 induced the docking of 14-3-3 to GEFH1 and the
relocation of 14-3-3 to microtubules. Zenke et al. (2004) concluded that
PAK and 14-3-3 are involved in the regulation of GEFH1 activity and that
phosphorylation of GEFH1 by PAK may coordinate RAC/CDC42- and
Rho-dependent signaling pathways.

RhoA is downregulated when epithelial cells reach confluence, resulting
in inhibition of signaling pathways that stimulate proliferation. By
coimmunoprecipitation, Aijaz et al. (2005) found that endogenous Gefh1
interacted with cingulin, a tight junction adaptor protein, in
Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Cingulin binding inhibited RhoA
activation and signaling, suggesting that the increase in cingulin
expression in confluent cells inhibits Gefh1 and thereby downregulates
RhoA. In agreement, RNA interference of Gefh1 or transfection of a
mutant Gefh1 unable to bind cingulin inhibited G1/S phase transition in
MDCK cells. Depletion of cingulin by regulated RNA interference resulted
in RhoA activation and the development of irregular cell monolayers.
Aijaz et al. (2005) concluded that the formation of epithelial tight
junctions contributes to the downregulation of RhoA by inactivating
Gefh1 in a cingulin-dependent manner.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the ARHGEF2
gene to chromosome 1.

601515	TITLE *601515 FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR 14; FGF14
;;FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR HOMOLOGOUS FACTOR 4; FHF4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FGF14 belongs to a subclass of fibroblast growth factors that are
expressed in the developing and adult central nervous system (Smallwood
et al., 1996). For a discussion on the FGF gene family, see FGF12
(601513).

CLONING

Smallwood et al. (1996) identified and characterized 4 novel members of
the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, including FGF14, which they
called FHF4. The genes were identified by a combination of random cDNA
sequencing, database searches, and degenerate PCR.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2000) characterized 2 mouse isoforms of Fgf14, which they
called Fgf14-1a and Fgf14-1b, resulting from alternative first exons. In
situ hybridization showed that Fgf14 is widely expressed in mouse brain,
spinal cord, major arteries, and thymus between embryonic days 12.5 and
14.5. In mouse cerebellar development, Fgf14 was first observed at
postnatal day 1 in postmitotic granule cells and later in migrating and
postmigratory granule cells. The Fgf14 expression pattern in cerebellum
was complementary to that of Math1 (ATOH1; 601461), a marker for
proliferating granule cells in the external germinal layer.

MAPPING

By Southern blot hybridization of genomic DNA from rodent/human hybrid
cell lines carrying individual human chromosomes, Smallwood et al.
(1996) mapped the FGF14 gene to chromosome 13. Using an interspecific
backcross mapping panel, they mapped the mouse homolog to chromosome 14,
very close to the Rap2a (179540) gene, which in the human maps to 13q34.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large 3-generation Dutch family with early-onset tremor,
dyskinesia, and slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia (SCA27; 609307),
van Swieten et al. (2003) found a phe145-to-ser mutation in the FGF14
gene (F145S; 601515.0001). The disorder was consistent with the
occurrence of ataxia and paroxysmal dyskinesia in Fgf14 knockout mice
(Wang et al., 2002).

In 1 of 208 unrelated patients with familial ataxia, Dalski et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion in the FGF14 gene
(601515.0002). The patient had early onset of the disorder and mild
mental retardation.

ANIMAL MODEL

To study the role of Fgf14 in CNS development and adult brain function,
Wang et al. (2002) generated Fgf14-deficient mice that expressed an
FGF14/beta-galactosidase fusion protein in place of the normal Fgf14
protein. The Fgf14-deficient mice were viable, fertile, and anatomically
normal, but developed ataxia and a paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement
disorder. The authors noted that the motor abnormalities are associated
with dysfunction of the basal ganglia system and resemble several human
dystonia syndromes. Using neuropharmacologic studies, Wang et al. (2002)
showed that the Fgf14-deficient mice had reduced responses to dopamine
agonists. They suggested a function for Fgf14 in neuronal signaling,
axonal trafficking, and synaptosomal function.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 27
FGF14, PHE145SER

In affected members of a 3-generation Dutch family with autosomal
dominant spinocerebellar ataxia-27 (609307), van Swieten et al. (2003)
identified a phe145-to-ser (F145S) mutation in the FGF14 gene. As
indicated by protein modeling, the amino acid change was predicted to
reduce the stability of the protein.

.0002
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 27
FGF14, 1-BP DEL, 487A

In a patient with spinocerebellar ataxia-27 (609307), Dalski et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (487delA) in exon 4 of
the FGF14 gene, resulting in premature termination of the protein and
loss of one-third of amino acid residues. The mutation was not
identified in 208 control samples. The patient had early onset of the
disorder and mild mental retardation.

142230	TITLE *142230 HEMATOPOIETIC PROGENITOR CELL ANTIGEN CD34; CD34
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CD34 is a monomeric cell surface antigen with a molecular mass of
approximately 110 kD that is selectively expressed on human
hematopoietic progenitor cells.

CLONING

In the hands of Sutherland et al. (1988), partial amino acid analysis of
highly purified CD34 antigen revealed no significant sequence similarity
with any previously described structures. Sequential immunoprecipitation
and Western blot analysis indicated that this antigen is not a member of
the leukosialin/sialophorin family, despite the fact that these
molecules share several structural similarities.

Simmons et al. (1992) isolated a cDNA clone for CD34. They stated that
the gene is expressed by small vessel endothelial cells in addition to
hematopoietic progenitor cells and is a sialomucin of as-yet-unknown
function.

Study of the CD34 cDNA permitted He et al. (1992) to demonstrate that it
encodes a type I transmembrane protein with no obvious homology to other
known proteins.

OTHER FEATURES

Sutherland et al. (1993) provided a review, including potential clinical
applications in selecting for hematopoietic stem cell progenitors from
tumor-contaminated marrow in preparation for transplantation and for
genetic manipulation in gene therapy.

GENE STRUCTURE

Satterthwaite et al. (1992) reported that the CD34 gene spans 26 kb and
has 8 exons. Using RNase protection, they demonstrated that the start
site of CD34 transcription is 258 bp upstream of the translational start
site. He et al. (1992) showed that the upstream regulatory sequences of
CD34 contain no TATA or CAAT box sequences, but MYB, MYC, and ETS-like
binding motifs were identified.

GENE FUNCTION

Continuous turnover of epithelia is ensured by the extensive
self-renewal capacity of tissue-specific stem cells. Similarly,
epithelial tumor maintenance relies on cancer stem cells, which co-opt
stem cell properties. In murine skin, follicular morphogenesis is driven
by bulge stem cells that specifically express CD34. Malanchi et al.
(2008) identified a population of cells in early epidermal tumors
characterized by phenotype and functional similarities to normal bulge
skin stem cells. This population contains cancer stem cells, which are
the only cells with tumor initiation properties. Transplants derived
from these cancer stem cells preserve the hierarchical organization of
the primary tumor. Malanchi et al. (2008) described beta-catenin
(116806) signaling as being essential in sustaining the cancer stem cell
phenotype. Ablation of the beta-catenin gene results in the loss of
cancer stem cells and complete tumor regression. In addition, Malanchi
et al. (2008) provided evidence for the involvement of increased
beta-catenin signaling in malignant human squamous cell carcinomas.
Malanchi et al. (2008) concluded that because Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
is not essential for normal epidermal homeostasis, such a mechanistic
difference may thus be targeted to eliminate cancer stem cells and
consequently eradicate squamous cell carcinomas.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of DNA from a panel of human/mouse somatic
cell hybrids using a CD34 cDNA probe, Tenen et al. (1990) demonstrated
that the gene for CD34 is located on 1q12-qter. By means of in situ
hybridization, Howell et al. (1991) narrowed the assignment to 1q32. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization, Satterthwaite et al. (1992) mapped
the gene to 1q32.

ANIMAL MODEL

To analyze the involvement of CD34 in hematopoiesis, Cheng et al. (1996)
produced both embryonic stem (ES) cells in mice null for the expression
of this mucin. Analysis of yolk sac-like hematopoietic development in
embryoid bodies derived from CD34-null ES cells showed a significant
delay in both erythroid and myeloid differentiation that could be
reversed by transfection of the mutant ES cells with CD34 constructs
expressing either a complete or truncated cytoplasmic domain. In spite
of these diminished embryonic hematopoietic progenitor numbers, the
CD34-null mice developed normally, and the hematopoietic profile of
adult blood appeared typical. However, the colony-forming activity of
hematopoietic progenitors derived from both bone marrow and spleen was
significantly reduced in adult CD34-deficient animals.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) give rise to all blood cells. CD34 is a
sialomucin-like adhesion molecule that is expressed on a few percent of
primitive bone marrow cells. In human bone marrow, virtually all
colony-forming unit activity resides in the population expressing human
CD34. In primates, CD34-positive cells, but not CD34-negative cells,
repopulate lethally irradiated baboons. On the other hand, in murine
hematopoiesis, HSCs are found almost exclusively in the CD34-negative to
-low fraction. Okuno et al. (2002) made transgenic mouse strains with
human genomic P1 artificial chromosome clones spanning the entire CD34
genomic locus. In all transgenic mouse strains, a vast majority of
phenotypic and functional HSC populations including mouse CD34-negative
or -low cells expressed the human CD34 transgene. These data strongly
supported the notion that CD34-positive human bone marrow cells contain
long-term HSCs that can maintain hematopoiesis throughout life.

Using fluorescence intravital microscopy (IVM) with homing assays,
Hidalgo et al. (2002) examined the repopulation of bone marrow of
sublethally irradiated nonobese diabetic (NOD)/severe combined
immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, which have multiple defects in innate and
adaptive immunologic functions, with human CD34-positive hematopoietic
progenitor cells obtained either from cord blood or from adult bone
marrow or peripheral blood. Human hematopoietic progenitor cells rolled
and arrested in NOD/SCID bone marrow microvessels, and the rolling
capacity of neonatal cord blood cells was much lower than that of adult
cells. Rolling and retention were nearly abolished in NOD/SCID Selp
(173610) -/- Sele (131210) -/- mice and in NOD/SCID Sele -/- mice. Flow
cytometric and IVM analyses suggested that the neonatal defect resulted
from expression of a nonfunctional form of SELPLG (600738) on cord blood
CD34-positive cells that were unable to bind Selp. This subset of cells
was enriched in CD34-positive/CD38 (107270)-low/negative progenitors.
Hidalgo et al. (2002) proposed that manipulation of expression of
selectins and their ligands may improve homing of cord blood
CD34-positive cells to bone marrow.
