CHOLESTEROL ESTER HYDROLASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Anderson and Sando (1991) reported that the amino acid sequence of LAL
as deduced from the 2.6-kb cDNA nucleotide sequence is 58% identical to
that of human gastric lipase (LIPF; 601980), which is involved in the
preduodenal breakdown of ingested triglycerides.

Anderson et al. (1994) isolated and sequenced the gene for LIPA.

GENE FUNCTION

The distinct kinetic and physical properties of lipases A and B (LIPB;
247980) were defined by Warner et al. (1980). They stated that the
natural substrate for LIPB was not known, and that it was not clear that
LIPB is a lysosomal hydrolase. LIPA may serve an important role in
cellular metabolism by releasing cholesterol. The liberated cholesterol
suppresses further cholesterol synthesis and stimulates esterification
of cholesterol within the cell.

GENE STRUCTURE

Aslanidis et al. (1994) summarized the exon structure of the LIPA gene,
which consists of 10 exons, together with the sizes of genomic EcoRI and
SacI fragments hybridizing to each exon. The DNA sequence of the
putative promoter region was presented.

Anderson et al. (1994) found that the LIPA gene is spread over 36 kb of
genomic DNA. The 5-prime flanking region is GC-rich and has
characteristics of a 'housekeeping' gene promoter.

MAPPING

Koch et al. (1979, 1981) assigned lysosomal acid lipase A to chromosome
10 by human-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids. Judging from the close
concordance with soluble glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT1;
138180), these loci were thought to be close together on the long arm of
10. Lipase A is encoded by chromosome 19 in mouse (Koch et al., 1981).
GOT1 is also on chromosome 10q in man and 19 in mouse.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Anderson et al. (1993) mapped the
LIPA locus to 10q23.2-q.23.3. It was clearly distinct from the locus for
pancreatic lipase (246600) at 10q26.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) and Wolman disease are
autosomal recessive allelic disorders (278000) associated with reduced
activity and genetic defects of lysosomal acid lipase. Aslanidis et al.
(1996) provided evidence that the strikingly more severe course of
Wolman disease is caused by genetic defects of LAL that leave no
residual enzyme activity. In a CESD patient, a G-to-A transition at
position -1 of the exon 8 splice donor site (613497.0002) resulted in
skipping of exon 8 in 97% of the mRNA originating from this allele,
while 3% was spliced correctly, resulting in full-length LAL enzyme. Two
sibs with Wolman disease were homozygous for a splice site mutation
involving the same donor site but permitting no correct splicing or
subsequent synthesis of functional enzyme (613497.0004).

Pagani et al. (1996) described the molecular basis of CESD in 3
patients. They identified mutations by sequence analysis of LAL cDNA and
genomic DNA. The role of the mutations as the direct cause of the
disease was confirmed by measuring the LAL enzymatic activity of
extracts from cells transfected with LAL mutants. The 3 CESD patients
were found to be compound heterozygotes. Pagani et al. (1996) identified
3 different missense mutations, 2 splicing defects, and a null allele.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
WOLMAN DISEASE
CHOLESTERYL ESTER STORAGE DISEASE, INCLUDED
LIPA, LEU179PRO

In a proband with Wolman disease (278000) from a nonconsanguineous
family, Anderson et al. (1994) detected a T-to-C transition at
nucleotide 639 of the LIPA gene that resulted in a nonconservative
missense mutation, leu179 to pro (L179P). This mutation was found in
compound heterozygosity with a single-base insertion resulting in a null
allele (613497.0004). The proband had had 2 older sibs with Wolman
disease. Anderson et al. (1994) noted that the L179P mutation is located
26 amino acids from the predicted active site of lysosomal acid lipase
and was expected to disrupt the alpha-helical structure in a highly
conserved region of the protein.

Maslen and Illingworth (1993) and Maslen et al. (1995) found the L179P
mutation in 2 sibs with cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD). In
these sibs the L179P mutation, inherited from the mother, was found in
compound heterozygosity with a splice site mutation that resulted in
skipping of exon 8 of lysosomal acid lipase (613497.0002). Maslen et al.
(1995) compared the phenotypes of other patients carrying the L179P or
the splice site mutation described by them and concluded that the L179P
mutant allele apparently does not make a substantial contribution to
cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity.

.0002
CHOLESTERYL ESTER STORAGE DISEASE
LIPA, 934G-A

In a 12-year-old patient with cholesteryl ester storage disease (278000)
from a nonconsanguineous Polish-German family, Klima et al. (1993)
detected a 72-bp in-frame deletion resulting in the loss of amino acid
codons 254 through 277. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed that the 72 bp
represented an exon, indicating that the deletion in the mRNA was caused
by defective splicing. Sequence analysis of the patient's genomic DNA
revealed a G-to-A substitution in the last nucleotide of the 72-bp exon
on 1 allele. No normal-sized mRNA was detectable in the propositus even
though he was not homozygous for the splice site mutation. Klima et al.
(1993) concluded that the patient was compound heterozygous for the
splice site mutation and a null allele. The patient showed LIPA activity
in cultured skin fibroblasts approximately 9% of normal.
Hepatosplenomegaly had been present since age 5 years.

Aslanidis et al. (1996) restudied the patient of Klima et al. (1993) and
defined the splice site mutation as a G-to-A mutation at position -1 of
the splice donor site following exon 8, resulting in incorrect splicing
and the removal of the 72-bp exon 8 of the LIPA gene. They determined
that the other allele of the patient carried a premature termination
mutation (613497.0003) as well as the L179P mutation (613497.0001); the
LIPA mRNA was rendered unstable by the premature stop codon. Aslanidis
et al. (1996) demonstrated that the splice site mutation allowed the
production of approximately 3 to 4% of correctly spliced mRNA relative
to wildtype. Aslanidis et al. (1996) also identified a mutation at the
same splice donor site, and also resulting in deletion of exon 8, in 2
sibs with Wolman disease; that mutation, at the +1 position, allowed no
correct splicing, and patient fibroblasts were devoid of enzymatic
activity. See 613497.0005.

In 2 sibs with CESD, Maslen and Illingworth (1993) and Maslen et al.
(1995) identified compound heterozygosity for this splice site mutation
in the LIPA gene, inherited from their father, and the L179P mutation
(613497.0001). The affected children were a sister and brother who
presented with idiopathic hepatomegaly at ages 6 and 8 years,
respectively. Subsequent analyses indicated that they also had
hypercholesterolemia and a severe reduction in cholesteryl ester
hydrolase activity in cultured fibroblasts.

Muntoni et al. (1995) observed homozygosity for the splice site mutation
(Klima et al., 1993) in a Spanish kindred with cholesterol ester storage
disease. Exon 8 of the LIPA gene was deleted.

.0003
CHOLESTERYL ESTER STORAGE DISEASE
LIPA, GLY245TER

Aslanidis et al. (1996) determined that the patient of Klima et al.
(1993) with cholesteryl ester storage disease (278000) was compound
heterozygous for a G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 836 in exon 7 of
the LIPA gene, resulting in substitution of gly245 with a termination
codon (G245X), and a splice site mutation resulting in skipping of exon
8 (613497.0002). The allele carrying the G245X mutation also carried the
L179P mutation (613497.0001). Aslanidis et al. (1996) concluded that
although the L179P mutation is believed to abolish the enzymatic
activity of the lysosomal acid lipase, it is the G245X mutation, through
its production of an unstable mRNA, that was responsible for the low
level of transcript (approximately 6% of wildtype) derived from the
paternal allele.

.0004
WOLMAN DISEASE
CHOLESTERYL ESTER STORAGE DISEASE, INCLUDED
LIPA, 1-BP INS, 634T

In a proband with Wolman disease (278000), Anderson et al. (1994) found
compound heterozygosity for insertion of a T nucleotide after nucleotide
634 in exon 6 of the LIPA gene, and a substitution of proline at
leucine-179 (613497.0001). The 634T insertion occurred at the end of a
run of 6 Ts and led to premature termination 12 amino acids downstream.
Anderson et al. (1994) also found this mutation in a proband and parent
from 1 of 11 unrelated CESD families examined.

.0005
WOLMAN DISEASE
LIPA, IVS8, G-A, +1

In 2 sibs with Wolman disease (278000) from a consanguineous family,
Aslanidis et al. (1996) detected homozygosity for a G-to-A mutation at
position +1 of the splice donor site following exon 8 of the LIPA gene.
Both children died within the first year of life. The parents, who were
heterozygous for the mutation, had reduced enzymatic activity, while no
enzymatic activity was detectable in fibroblasts from the affected
children. Although the same donor splice site is involved as in the
mutation reported in CESD (934G-A, 613497.0002), the nucleotide at
position +1 was changed in the Wolman disease mutation while the
nucleotide at position -1 was changed in the CESD mutation. Both
mutations result in deletion of the same 24 amino acids (exon 8), but
the effects are dramatically different: the -1 mutation allowed some
correct splicing (3% of total LIPA RNA), but the +1 splice site
mutation, which affects one of the invariable nucleotides of the splice
consensus sequences, permits no correct splicing. Aslanidis et al.
(1996) suggested that the residual activity in CESD patients compared to
Wolman patients may result either from a partially active enzyme with
the internal deletion of 24 amino acids (skipping of exon 8) or from the
production of low amounts of the full size of the protein due to
inefficient exon exclusion from the mutated allele.

.0006
WOLMAN DISEASE
LIPA, TYR22TER

In a Japanese patient with Wolman disease (278000), Fujiyama et al.
(1996) identified a tyr22-to-ter (Y22X) mutation of the LIPA gene. The
female patient had an umbilical cord herniation at birth. At about 30
days after birth, she showed abdominal distention with
hepatosplenomegaly and frequent episodes of diarrhea and vomiting.
Abdominal computed tomography revealed massive hepatosplenomegaly and
enlargement of the adrenal glands with calcification. Anemia and hepatic
failure progressed rapidly and she died at age 114 days. The parents
were first cousins. An older sister had died with similar symptoms 80
days after birth.

.0007
WOLMAN DISEASE
LIPA, 1-BP DEL, 482A

In an infant, born of unrelated parents, with Wolman disease (278000),
Lee et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (482delA) in
exon 5 of the LIPA gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature
truncation at residue 179. The mutation, which was inherited from the
unaffected father, was not found in 200 controls chromosomes. The other
allele, inherited from the unaffected mother, carried an intragenic
deletion of the LIPA gene including intron 3 and part of exon 4; both
the patient and mother had only 1 copy of exon 4. The patient presented
at age 6 weeks with abdominal distention and failure to thrive. He had
hepatosplenomegaly and calcified adrenals; LIPA activity was
undetectable. He died of multiorgan failure within the following month.

;;BCL9-2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to BCL9 (602597), Katoh and
Katoh (2003) identified BCL9L. The deduced 1,499-amino acid protein
contains 6 regions of homology with other BCL proteins. It has a nuclear
localization signal, but no signal peptide or transmembrane domain.
Katoh and Katoh (2003) also identified the mouse Bcl9l gene. The deduced
mouse protein shares 94% identity with human BCL9L. In silico analysis
of human mRNAs indicated that BCL9L is expressed in fetal brain, adult
lung, amygdala, eye, and prostate, as well as in several types of
tumors.

GENE FUNCTION

Brembeck et al. (2004) found that BCL9-2 induced epithelial mesenchymal
transitions in a nontransformed canine kidney cell line and increased
beta-catenin (116806)-dependent transcription. RNA interference of
BCL9-2 in carcinoma cells induced an epithelial phenotype and
translocated beta-catenin from the nucleus to the cell membrane. The
switch between the adhesive and transcriptional functions of
beta-catenin was modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin,
which favored BCL9-2 binding and precluded interaction with
alpha-catenin (see 116805). During zebrafish embryogenesis, Bcl9-2 acted
in the Wnt8 (see 606360) signaling pathway and regulated mesoderm
patterning.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2003) determined that the BCL9L gene contains 8 exons
and spans 15 kb. The mouse Bcl9l gene contains 8 exons and has the same
exon-intron structure.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2003) mapped the BCL9L
gene to chromosome 11q23.3.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pyruvate carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.1) is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate. It is
a key regulatory enzyme in gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and
neurotransmitter synthesis. Human PC is a tetramer composed of identical
subunits (Barden et al., 1974).

CLONING

Using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the amino acid sequence at
the biotin site of pyruvate carboxylase to screen a human liver cDNA
library, Freytag and Collier (1984) isolated 3 cDNA clones for pyruvate
carboxylase. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.2-kb mRNA.

Wexler et al. (1994) isolated a PC cDNA, which encodes a deduced
1,178-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 129.6 kD for the
full-length precursor and 127.4 kD for the mature apoprotein. Northern
blot analysis demonstrated that the highest level of PC mRNA is in the
liver. Based on homology with other biotin-containing proteins, the ATP,
pyruvate, and biotin-binding sites were identified. MacKay et al. (1994)
isolated and cloned PC cDNA from human kidney.

Carbone et al. (1998) characterized the PC gene by PCR amplification,
subcloning, and sequencing.

GENE STRUCTURE

Carbone et al. (1998) determined that the PC gene contains 19 exons
spanning approximately 16 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

Using Southern blotting of human-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids,
Freytag and Collier (1984) localized the PC gene to the long arm of
chromosome 11.

Rochelle et al. (1992) indicated that the corresponding locus in the
mouse is located on chromosome 19 near the centromere. Comparative
mapping suggested that the human PC locus is in the proximal part of
11q, perhaps 11q12-q13.

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization to normal chromosomes and
chromosomes carrying the FRA11A (136560) fragile site, Walker et al.
(1995) mapped PC to 11q13, distal to FRA11A, thus localizing it to
11q13.4-q13.5. Perucca-Lostanlen et al. (1997) used fluorescence in situ
hybridization with yeast artificial chromosome and cosmid probes on
metaphase chromosomes of patients expressing the fragile site to show
that FRA11A is situated centromeric to ACTN3 (102574) and telomeric to
D11S913, these markers being within an interval of approximately 1 Mb in
the 11q13.3 region.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 11 Ojibwa and 2 Cree patients with group A pyruvate carboxylase
deficiency (266150), Carbone et al. (1998) identified a missense
mutation in the PC gene (608786.0001). In 2 brothers of Micmac origin,
they identified a transversion mutation in the PC gene (608786.0002).
Carrier frequency was estimated to be as high as 1 in 10 in some
groupings. The 2 point mutations were located in the region of homology
conserved among yeast, rat, and human PC, in the vicinity of the
carboxylation domain of the enzyme.

NOMENCLATURE

Brun et al. (1999) referred to pyruvate carboxylase as a key enzyme in
the gluconeogenesis and anaplerotic metabolic pathways. Anaplerotic is a
somewhat archaic term derived from the Greek stems ana, meaning 'for
up,' and plerotic, meaning 'for filling.' The adjective anaplerotic
refers to a reaction that effects best the formation of an intermediate
of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, in order to maintain the intracellular
concentration of it, or of another such intermediate, as those
intermediates are utilized for biosynthesis.

In 11 Ojibwa and 2 Cree Amerindian patients with simple pyruvate

PC, VAL145ALA

In affected members of a consanguineous family with PC deficiency
(266150), Wexler et al. (1998) identified a homozygous 434T-C transition
in the PC gene, resulting in a val145-to-ala (V145A) substitution. Both
parents were heterozygous for the mutation. The patients were found to
have low PC activity (range 2-25% of control) in blood lymphocytes and
skin fibroblasts associated with either diminished or normal protein
levels.

In an affected brother and sister from a consanguineous family with PC

1351C-T transition the PC gene, resulting in an arg451-to-cys (R451C)
substitution. Both parents were heterozygous for the mutation. Both
mutations occurred in relatively conserved amino acid residues and were
located in the biotin carboxylase domain.

.0005
PYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY
PC, IVS15, 4-BP DEL, TAGG, +2-5

In 2 brothers with severe (type B) pyruvate carboxylase deficiency
(266150), Carbone et al. (2002) found compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the PC gene: a TAGG deletion at the exon 15/intron 15
splice site (IVS15+2-5delTAGG) and a dinucleotide deletion in exon 16
(2491-2492delGT; 608786.0006). By RT-PCR and sequencing of aberrant
transcripts, Carbone et al. (2002) found that the splice site mutation
resulted in the retention of intron 15 during pre-mRNA splicing. In
addition, both deletions were predicted to result in a frameshift to
generate a premature termination codon such that the encoded mRNA would
be subject to nonsense-mediated decay. In 1 brother, the diagnosis was
made at the age of 4 hours and death occurred at 7 weeks; in the younger
brother, the diagnosis was made in the fetus and death was in the
neonatal period.

identified a homozygous 467G-A transition in exon 3 of the PC gene,
resulting in an arg156-to-gln (R156Q) substitution in the biotin
carboxylase domain. The mutation had no detectable effect on mRNA size
or amount. Monnot et al. (2009) observed that the relatively milder type
A phenotype results from missense mutations in the PC gene.

In a patient with type B PC deficiency (266150), Monnot et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PC gene: a
1748G-T transversion in exon 12, resulting in an arg583-to-leu (R583L)
substitution in the carboxytransferase domain, and a 1-bp duplication in
exon 17 (2876dupT; 608786.0009), resulting in a frameshift,
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and no functional protein. The R583L
mutation had no detectable effect on mRNA size or amount. Monnot et al.
(2009) commented that patients with the relatively more severe type B
tend to have at least 1 truncating mutation in the PC gene.
