DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZBED proteins, such as ZMYM6, or ZBED7, originated from domesticated hAT
DNA transposons and encode regulatory proteins with diverse, fundamental
functions in vertebrates (Hayward et al., 2013).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences encoding zinc finger-like
proteins, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of a human thymus cDNA
library, Smedley et al. (1999) cloned ZNF258. The deduced 724-amino acid
protein contains 5 tandem myeloproliferative and mental retardation
(MYM) motifs, conserved motifs that closely resemble zinc-binding
sequences. However, 2 of the repeats are imperfect and each lacks 2
conserved cysteines. Northern blot analysis detected variable expression
of several ZNF258 transcripts in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned ZMYM6, which they designated
KIAA1353. The transcript contains several repetitive elements in its
5-prime end. The deduced protein contains 640 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected ZMYM6 expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific
adult brain regions examined.

By searching databases for ZBED genes, Hayward et al. (2013) identified
ZMYM6, which they called ZBED7.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Smedley et al. (1999) mapped
the ZMYM6 gene to chromosome 14q12. However, using radiation hybrid
analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the ZMYM6 gene to chromosome 1.
Gross (2013) mapped the ZMYM6 gene to chromosome 1p34.3 based on an
alignment of the ZMYM6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC117463) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

EVOLUTION

Hayward et al. (2013) found that the ZBED genes originated from at least
2 independent hAT DNA transposon domestication events in ancestors of
primitive jawed vertebrates, since no orthologs of ZBED were found in
jawless fish or more primitive vertebrates. ZBED7 belongs to the Buster
family of domesticated hAT DNA transposons, which also includes ZBED5
(615251), ZBED8 (C5ORF54; 615253), and ZBED9 (SCAND3; 615254).
