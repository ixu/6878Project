615263	TITLE *615263 FAMILY WITH SEQUENCE SIMILARITY 86, MEMBER A; FAM86A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from a donor,
generally S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), to acceptor molecules,
including proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids, and small metabolites. FAM86A
belongs to a family of protein lysine methyltransferases that methylate
nonhistone proteins (Cloutier et al., 2013).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to METTL22 (615261),
Cloutier et al. (2013) identified FAM86A. The deduced protein is made up
predominantly of a Rossmann fold of alternating beta strands and alpha
helices, with a conserved AdoMet-binding site near the N terminus.
Epitope-tagged FAM86A was predominantly expressed in a diffuse
cytoplasmic distribution in transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By affinity purification, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry, Cloutier et
al. (2013) found that FAM86A expressed in HEK293 cells interacted with
FAM86B and FAM86C.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the FAM86A gene to chromosome 16p13.3 based on an
alignment of the FAM86A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY037162) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

605325	TITLE *605325 CYTOCHROME P450, SUBFAMILY IIIA, POLYPEPTIDE 5; CYP3A5
;;P450PCN3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CYP3A enzymes are the most abundantly expressed cytochrome P450 enzymes
in liver and are responsible for the metabolism of over 50% of all
clinically used drugs (Paulussen et al., 2000).

CLONING

By screening a liver cDNA library with CYP3A4 (124010) as probe, Aoyama
et al. (1989) isolated a cDNA encoding CYP3A5, which they termed PCN3.
Immunoblot analysis of liver microsomes showed that CYP3A5 is expressed
as a 52.5-kD protein, whereas CYP3A4 migrates as a 52.0-kD protein. The
deduced 502-amino acid CYP3A5 protein shares 85% sequence similarity
with CYP3A4. Analysis of enzymatic activity established that CYP3A4 and
CYP3A5 have overlapping substrate specificity with minor differences in
the metabolism of steroids and cyclosporine, suggesting that CYP3A4 may
bind these drugs at more than 1 site.

MAPPING

Jounaidi et al. (1994) isolated the 5-prime flanking region of CYP3A5
from a genomic clone on chromosome 7. Promoter analysis determined that
CYP3A5 uses a CATAA, rather than a TATA, box at positions -23 to -28 and
has a basic transcription element from -35 to -50. Jounaidi et al.
(1994) stated that CYP3A5 and CYP3A7 appear to be tandemly associated
and transcribed in the same direction.

Gellner et al. (2001) found that a 231-kb region on chromosome 7q21.1
contains 3 CYP3A genes: CYP3A4 (124010), CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 (605340), as
well as 3 pseudogenes and a novel CYP3A gene, which they termed CYP3A43
(606534).

GENE FUNCTION

Yamakoshi et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA clone for CYP3A5 from a prostate
library and determined that it has a unique 5-prime untranslated
sequence, suggesting that CYP3A5 is differentially regulated in liver
and prostate. Enzymatic analysis showed that the prostate form of the
enzyme can metabolize sex hormones.

Kuehl et al. (2001) stated that variation in the CYP3A enzymes
influences circulating steroid levels and responses to half of all
oxidatively metabolized drugs. CYP3A activity is the sum activity of the
family of CYP3A genes, including CYP3A5, which is polymorphically
expressed at high levels in a minority of Caucasians. Only individuals
with at least one CYP3A5*1 (wildtype) allele express large amounts of
CYP3A5. Kuehl et al. (2001) demonstrated that SNPs in CYP3A5*3 (6986A-G;
605235.0001) and CYP3A5*6 (a G-to-A transition in exon 7 resulting in
deletion of that exon), which cause alternative splicing and protein
truncation, result in the absence of CYP3A5 from tissues of some people.
CYP3A5 was more frequently expressed in livers of African Americans
(60%) than in those of Caucasians (33%). Because CYP3A5 represents at
least 50% of the total hepatic CYP3A content in people polymorphically
expressing CYP3A5, CYP3A5 may be the most important genetic contributor
to interindividual and interracial differences in CYP3A-dependent drug
clearance and in responses to many medicines. There are substantial
interindividual differences in CYP3A expression, exceeding 30-fold in
some populations. The polymorphic distribution of the wildtype CYP3A5*1
allele indicates that relatively high levels of metabolically active
CYP3A5 are expressed by an estimated 30% of Caucasians, 30% of Japanese,
30% of Mexicans, 40% of Chinese, and more than 50% of African Americans,
Southeast Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Southwestern American Indians.
The higher prevalence of CYP3A5 expression indicates that these
non-Caucasians are more likely to experience higher clearance of drugs
principally inactivated by CYP3A; are less likely to experience
dose-limiting toxicities; and have different risks of diseases that are
associated with the CYP3A5 expressor phenotype.

Kuehl et al. (2001) proposed that the expressor allele confers a
selective advantage in equatorial populations that may experience water
shortages. Thompson et al. (2004) genotyped the CYP3A5*1/*3
polymorphism, which is likely to influence salt and water retention and
risk for salt-sensitive hypertension (145500), in more than 1,000
individuals from 52 worldwide population samples. The results revealed
an unusual geographic pattern whereby the CYP3A5*3 frequency showed
extreme variation across populations and was significantly correlated
with distance from the equator. Furthermore, an unlinked variant, a
met235-to-thr SNP in the AGT gene (M235T; 106150.0001), previously
implicated in hypertension and preeclampsia, exhibited a similar
geographic distribution and had a significantly correlated frequency
with CYP3A5*1/*3. Thompson et al. (2004) concluded that variants that
influence salt homeostasis are the targets of a shared selective
pressure that results from an environmental variable correlated with
latitude.

Lee et al. (2003) identified 4 novel SNPs in the CYP3A5 gene producing
coding changes in different ethnic groups. R28C occurred in African
populations (allelic frequency, 4%), A337T occurred in Asians (allelic
frequency, 2%), L82R occurred in a racially unidentified group, and
F446S occurred in Caucasians (allelic frequency, 2%). These SNPs were on
an allele containing the CYP3A5*3 SNP. The newly identified allelic
proteins were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, expressed in E.
coli, and purified. CYP3A5*1 exhibited the highest maximal clearance for
testosterone, followed by A337T, which was greater than R28C; R28C was
much greater than F446S. F446S exhibited a more than 95% decrease in the
intrinsic clearance for both testosterone and nifedipine oxidation, and
was predicted to be more catalytically defective than the splice change
alone.

The cholesterol lowering agents lovastatin, simvastatin, and
atorvastatin are metabolized primarily by CYP3A4; however, the
polymorphic CYP3A5 also contributes to the biotransformation of these
statins. Individuals carrying at least 1 copy of the wildtype CYP3A5*1
allele express CYP3A5 protein in the liver and some extrahepatic tissues
such as the small intestine, whereas CYP3A5*3 homozygotes are designated
CYP3A5 nonexpressors. Kivisto et al. (2004) studied whether expression
of CYP3A5 is associated with an impaired lipid-lowering response to
statins in 69 Caucasian patients. They found that lovastatin,
simvastatin, and atorvastatin were significantly less effective in
CYP3A5 expressors than in nonexpressors. No association between
hypolipidemic efficacy and CYP3A5 polymorphism was observed among 23
subjects taking statins that are not dependent on CYP3A5 (viz.,
fluvastatin or pravastatin).

HISTORY

Paulussen et al. (2000) analyzed what was thought to be the 5-prime
flanking region of the CYP3A5 gene and reported 2 linked polymorphisms,
-369T/G and -45A/G, located in transcriptional regulatory elements that
were associated with increased expression and activity of the gene.
Kuehl et al. (2001) noted, however, that sequencing of the CYP3A locus
revealed that these SNPs were actually in the promoter of the pseudogene
CYP3AP1, and thus could not be the basis for polymorphic CYP3A5
expression.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPERTENSION, SALT-SENSITIVE ESSENTIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
CYP3A5, 6986A-G

In many populations, total adult CYP3A protein content of tissues
remains constant and consists largely of CYP3A4, whereas CYP3A5
expression has extreme interpopulation variability. This variation is
largely due to a 6986A-G substitution in intron 3 of CYP3A5 (the
CYP3A5*3 allele; SV1-CYP3A5) that results in improperly spliced mRNA and
a nonfunctional protein truncated at amino acid 102 (Kuehl et al., 2001;
Lin et al., 2002). The CYP3A5*3 allele is reported to have a frequency
of approximately 27 to 50% among African Americans, 85 to 95% among
whites (Hustert et al., 2001; Kuehl et al., 2001), and 60 to 73% among
Asians (Hustert et al., 2001).

Givens et al. (2003) found that, among renal microsomes from 21 organ
donors, those from *1/*3 individuals had at least 8-fold higher mean
kidney microsomal CYP3A5 content and 18-fold higher mean CYP3A catalytic
activity than did those from *3/*3 individuals (p = 0.0001 and p =
0.0137, respectively). They also found significant associations between
the 6986A-G polymorphism and systolic blood pressure (p = 0.0007), mean
arterial pressure (p = 0.0075), and creatinine clearance (p = 0.0035)
among 25 healthy African American adults. The associations remained
significant when sex, age, and body mass index were considered. The mean
systolic blood pressure of homozygous CYP3A5 expressors (*1/*1) exceeded
that of homozygous nonexpressors (*3/*3) by 19.3 mm Hg. Givens et al.
(2003) speculated that a high CYPA5 expressor allele frequency among
African Americans may contribute to a high prevalence of salt-sensitive
hypertension (145500) in this population.

Thompson et al. (2004) found that the CYP3A5*3 allele is significantly
correlated with distance from the equator. They noted that a
met235-to-thr SNP in the AGT gene (M235T; 106150.0001), previously
implicated in hypertension and preeclampsia, exhibited a similar
geographic distribution and had a significantly correlated frequency
with CYP3A5*1/*3. Thompson et al. (2004) concluded that variants that
influence salt homeostasis are the targets of a shared selective
pressure that results from an environmental variable correlated with
latitude.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Price et al. (1992) cloned mouse Nkx2d, which they called Nkx2.4. The
Nkx2d protein contains a homeobox domain that is identical to that of
mouse Ttf1 (600635). Wang et al. (2000) cloned a full-length cDNA
encoding mouse Nkx2d. The deduced protein contains 355 amino acids.
RNAse protection analysis of RNA from several mouse tissues detected
expression of Nkx2d only in testis.

GENE FAMILY

Holland et al. (2007) stated that the NKX2-1 (600635) and NKX2-4 genes
are collectively orthologous to Drosophila scro and comprise the Nk2.1
gene family.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Wang et al. (2000) mapped the NKX2D
gene to chromosome 20p11, where it is linked with the NKX2B gene
(604612). By backcross analysis, they mapped the mouse Nkx2d gene to the
distal region of chromosome 2.

604429	TITLE *604429 PROLINE-RICH GAMMA-CARBOXYGLUTAMIC ACID PROTEIN 2; PRRG2
;;PROLINE-RICH GLA PROTEIN 2; PRGP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Homologous domains containing 9 to 12 gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)
residues are present within the N-terminal 48 amino acids of a number of
proteins, including several coagulation and anticoagulation factors.
These Gla residues are produced by posttranslational modification of
specific glutamic acid residues by a vitamin K-dependent
gamma-carboxylase (GGCX; 137167) in the rough endoplasmic reticulum
(ER). This reaction requires a gamma-carboxylation recognition sequence
contained within a propeptide that is flanked by a signal peptide and
the N-terminal domain of the mature protein where the
gamma-carboxylation occurs. The coordination of calcium by several Gla
residues is required for proper conformation of the Gla domain. By
searching an EST database with an amino acid sequence derived from a
highly conserved region of human Gla domain sequences, Kulman et al.
(1997) identified 2 novel Gla domain-containing proteins, PRRG1 (604428)
and PRRG2, which they called PRGP1 and PRGP2, respectively. They
isolated a full-length PRRG2 cDNA containing a 548-bp 3-prime
untranslated region. The predicted 202-amino acid PRRG2 protein has a
49-amino acid signal/propeptide that contains the highly conserved
residues implicated in gamma-carboxylation; an N-terminal Gla domain; a
transmembrane region; and a proline-rich C-terminal region that contains
PPXY and PXXP motifs, which are found in proteins that interact with WW
domains and SH3 domains, respectively. The presence of an N-terminal
signal peptide and a putative transmembrane region defines PRRG2 as a
type I single-pass transmembrane protein with the C terminus oriented to
the cytoplasm. Northern blot analysis detected an approximately 1.3-kb
PRRG2 transcript in a wide variety of tissues, with the highest
expression in thyroid.

GENE FUNCTION

Kulman et al. (2007) found that human PRGP2 carboxylation and propeptide
processing were concerted and sequentially ordered processes in Chinese
hamster ovary cells, and that carboxylation was rate limiting. Sequence
analysis suggested that the N-terminal Gla domain of PRGP2 is exposed to
the ER lumen and that the C terminus is cytoplasmic. Western blot
analysis and flow cytometry showed that the Gla domain of the mature
protein was exposed on the cell surface. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis
revealed that the cytoplasmic tail of PRGP2 interacted with a YAP (YAP1;
606608) isoform containing 2 type I WW domains. Both PY motifs of PRGP2
and both WW domains of YAP were required to form a tight complex.

608187	TITLE *608187 MINICHROMOSOME MAINTENANCE, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, 8; MCM8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Minichromosome maintenance proteins, such as MCM8, are required for DNA
replication. Some MCMs interact to form a DNA helicase complex.

CLONING

By examining hepatitis B virus integration sites in hepatocellular
carcinoma DNA, Gozuacik et al. (2003) identified an MCM-like sequence on
chromosome 20. Using PCR with primers designed from this genomic
sequence, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Gozuacik et al. (2003)
cloned a full-length MCM8 cDNA from a liver cDNA library. The deduced
840-amino acid protein has an MCM domain containing the MCM signature
sequence and the Walker A-type NTP-binding site. It also has a zinc
finger motif. MCM8 shares 21.3% to 26.5% amino acid identity with other
MCMs, with highest conservation in the central 210 amino acids
containing the MCM domain. Western blot analysis detected endogenous
MCM8 expressed in HeLa cells at an apparent molecular mass of 95 kD.
Western blot analysis detected an identical protein in normal
fibroblasts and several tumor-derived human cell lines, as well as in
normal liver and skeletal muscle. Confocal microscopy localized
endogenous MCM8 mainly to nuclei of fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Since
MCM8 lacks a nuclear localization signal, Gozuacik et al. (2003)
hypothesized that MCM8 is targeted to nuclei through interaction with
other proteins.

By searching an EST database for homologs of MCM7 (600592), Johnson et
al. (2003) identified MCM8. The deduced 840-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of about 92 kD. The N-terminal 250 amino acids
of MCM8 are distinct from the N termini of other MCMs. By SDS-PAGE, MCM8
migrated with an apparent molecular mass of about 100 kD. Johnson et al.
(2003) identified proteins sharing significant similarity with MCM8 in
Drosophila, roundworms, and Arabidopsis, but none were found in yeast or
lower organisms. RT-PCR detected highest expression in placenta, lung,
and pancreas, low expression in brain, and little to no expression in
skeletal muscle and kidney. RT-PCR also detected expression in all tumor
tissues examined. In a colon adenocarcinoma, MCM8 expression was reduced
relative to normal colon tissue.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gozuacik et al. (2003) mapped the MCM8
gene to chromosome 20p13-p12.3. Johnson et al. (2003) determined that
MCM8 lies in a head-to-head orientation with the GCD10 gene on
chromosome 20p13-p12.3.

GENE FUNCTION

By flow cytometry and Northern blot analysis, Gozuacik et al. (2003)
determined that MCM8 mRNA expression increased in a fibroblast cell line
during the G1 phase of the cell cycle following release from G0 arrest,
and MCM8 mRNA accumulation continued into the S and G2/M phases. A
portion of MCM8 was associated with chromatin, and the association began
in the early S phase after the establishment of replication forks.
Unlike MCM3 (602693), MCM8 did not associate with chromatin structures
in G1 phase.

By coimmunoprecipitation, ion chromatography, and glycerol gradient
centrifugation of HeLa cell MCM proteins, Johnson et al. (2003) found
that MCM8 exists both as an unbound protein and in association with
constituents of the potential helicase complex, including MCM4 (602638),
MCM6 (601806), and MCM7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of an association between variation in the MCM8 gene and
age at natural menopause, see MENOQ3 (612885).

GENE STRUCTURE

Johnson et al. (2003) determined that the MCM8 gene contains 19 exons,
spans about 44 kb, and lies in a head-to-head orientation with the GCD10
gene (608188). The 5-prime untranslated region, which is shared with
GCD10, contains a CpG island and a putative CCAAT element that is less
than 30 bp from the GCD10 start point, but lacks TATA boxes for either
gene. There are putative binding sites for SP1 (189906), ETS1 (164720),
E2F1 (189971), and PURA (600473).

604853	TITLE *604853 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L28; MRPL28
;;MELANOMA-ASSOCIATED ANTIGEN RECOGNIZED BY T LYMPHOCYTES 1; MAAT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPL28
is a component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

Treatment with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and interleukin-2
(IL2; 147680) can mediate regression of metastatic melanoma (Rosenberg
et al., 1990). TILs recognize and lyse melanoma cells in an MHC class I-
or class II-restricted manner. The antigens may be encoded by nonmutated
genes in which the level of expression is increased in melanoma. Robbins
et al. (1995) obtained a TIL clone, TIL 1290, from a patient with a
recurrent pelvic tumor 3 years after successful treatment with another
TIL clone, TIL 888, which recognizes tyrosinase in an HLA-A24-restricted
manner. They also obtained a melanoma cell line, 888 mel, from the same
patient. By screening an 888 mel cDNA library with TIL 1290 for
induction of cytokine GMCSF (138960) release, Robbins et al. (1995)
isolated a cDNA that specifically stimulated TIL 1290 in an
HLA-A24-restricted manner, but not TIL 888. The cDNA encodes a deduced
128-amino acid protein, MAAT1, termed p15 by the authors. The lack of a
signal peptide, N-linked glycosylation sites, and hydrophobic domains
suggests that MAAT1 is a cytoplasmic or nuclear protein. Northern blot
analysis revealed expression of an approximately 0.9-kb transcript in
all normal tissues and cell lines examined.

By searching databases using bovine Mrpl28 as query, Koc et al. (2001)
identified human MRPL28. The deduced 256-amino acid protein has an
N-terminal mitochondrial import signal with a cleavage site at residue
25. Koc et al. (2001) also identified MRPL28 homologs in all species
examined, including plants. Mouse and human MRPL28 share 82.8% amino
acid identity.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MRPL28
gene to chromosome 16 (TMAP REN95718).

605534	TITLE *605534 HIGH MOBILITY GROUP PROTEIN 20A; HMG20A
DESCRIPTION High mobility group (HMG) proteins are nonhistone chromosomal proteins
that contain a conserved DNA-binding domain called the HMG box. See HMG2
(163906) for additional information on HMG proteins.

By EST database searching with sequence obtained from a clone on
chromosome 15q24, Sumoy et al. (2000) identified a novel member of the
HMG family, which they designated HMG20A. The full-length HMG20A cDNA
encodes a deduced 347-amino acid protein. Northern blot analysis
detected 2 major transcripts of approximately 4 and 9 kb and a barely
detectable transcript of 1.5 kb. The 4-kb transcript is expressed almost
ubiquitously, with highest expression in spleen, testis, and heart and
lower levels in peripheral blood leukocytes. Brain expression is mostly
uniform, with higher expression in cerebellum and lower levels in spinal
cord and subthalamic nucleus. The 9-kb transcript is differentially
expressed in spleen, testis, leukocytes, and brain and is barely
detectable in other tissues.

Sumoy et al. (2000) determined that the HMG20A gene contains 10 exons.
They confirmed the mapping of the HMG20A gene to chromosome 15q24 by
FISH and by radiation hybrid analysis.

603153	TITLE *603153 RAD1, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF; RAD1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the fission yeast S. pombe, the rad1+ gene product is required for
DNA repair and replication. Parker et al. (1998) cloned 2 alternatively
spliced human cDNAs encoding proteins with significant homology to yeast
rad1+. The longer cDNA, called Hrad1A, encodes a 282-amino acid
polypeptide, while Hrad1B encodes a 163-amino acid polypeptide. Northern
blot analysis revealed that human RAD1 is expressed as mRNAs of 5, 3,
and 1.3 kb in a variety of human tissues, with higher levels present in
some cancer cell lines. Northern blot analysis of cells subjected to
ultraviolet radiation demonstrated that human RAD1 expression is not
induced in response to DNA damage. Purified RAD1 exhibited terminal
exonuclease activity on double-stranded DNA, with a preference for
3-prime ends.

Independently, Udell et al. (1998) isolated RAD1 cDNAs from a
spontaneously transformed human keratinocyte cDNA library. The cDNAs
encode the 282-amino acid RAD1 isoform, which is 90% and 27% identical
to mouse Rad1 and S. pombe rad1+, respectively. Udell et al. (1998)
found that expression of human RAD1 in yeast rad1 mutants partially
restores radiation resistance and G2 checkpoint proficiency.

GENE FUNCTION

Volkmer and Karnitz (1999) demonstrated that the human RAD1 and HUS1
(603760) proteins associate in a complex that interacts with a highly
modified form of RAD9 (603761). They concluded that these 3 proteins are
central components of a DNA damage-responsive protein complex in human
cells.

MAPPING

Parker et al. (1998) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the
RAD1 gene to human chromosome 5p13.3-p13.2. The authors stated that loss
of heterozygosity (LOH) of this region has been linked to a variety of
human neoplasias. This mapping assignment was confirmed by Dean et al.
(1998) using fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid
analysis.

612610	TITLE *612610 LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE PROTEIN 2B; LCE2B
;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 10; LEP10;;
XP5
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

Using a selection cloning method to identify genes within the epidermal
differentiation complex (EDC) on chromosome 1, Zhao and Elder (1997)
identified LCE2B, which they called XP5. The deduced protein contains
110 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected XP5 expression in
normal and psoriatic skin, but not in other tissues and cell lines
examined, including normal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts.

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE2B,
which they called LEP10. RT-PCR detected high LEP10 expression in skin.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) detected LCE2B expression in
human fetal, arm, penal, and abdominal skin. Little to no expression was
detected in vulva, tongue, and esophagus.

GENE FUNCTION

Jackson et al. (2005) showed that expression of LCE2 genes, including
LCE2B, was upregulated in cultured normal human keratinocytes by both
ultraviolet irradiation and calcium.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that the LCE2B gene contains 2 exons.
Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Zhao and Elder (1997) mapped the LCE2B gene to chromosome
1q21. By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the
LCE2B gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et
al. (2005) stated that the mouse Lce2b gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene
cluster on chromosome 3F1.

;;AZ1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; AZ1;;
KIAA1118
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human adult brain
cDNA library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned AZI1, which they designated
KIAA1118. The deduced 1,165-amino acid protein shares a high degree of
similarity with the mouse Azi1 protein and with the troponin family (see
191041). RT-PCR ELISA detected highest AZI1 expression in spinal cord,
followed by testis, ovary, amygdala, cerebellum, and thalamus. Lower
expression was detected in all other adult and fetal tissues and
specific adult brain regions examined.

Aoto et al. (1995) cloned mouse Az1 from a testis cDNA library. The
deduced 947-amino acid protein has 2 proline-rich regions in its
N-terminal half, 5 potential N-glycosylation sites, and several putative
nuclear targeting sequences. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.7-kb
transcript in all mouse tissues examined, with highest expression in
testis, followed by ovary, brain, and adipose tissue. In mouse testis,
expression began in pachytene spermatocytes beginning at 16 days of age,
when meiosis occurs. Testis of jsd/jsd mice, in which germ cells are
arrested in an early stage of spermatogenesis, did not express Az1.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed Az1 expression in the preacrosome
region of round and elongated spermatids in seminiferous tubules, but
not in more differentiated spermatids.

GENE FUNCTION

Aoto et al. (1995) found that the expression of Az1 was induced by
5-azacytidine, a potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase (see 126375)
that causes differentiation of C3H10T1/2 mouse mesenchymal cells into
chondrocytes, adipocytes, and myotubes, or induces transformation.

MAPPING

By analyzing a human-rodent hybrid panel, Kikuno et al. (1999) mapped
the AZI1 gene to chromosome 17. Gross (2011) mapped the AZI1 gene to
chromosome 17q25.3 based on an alignment of the AZI1 sequence (GenBank
GENBANK BC136578) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

608112	TITLE *608112 TRAFFICKING PROTEIN, KINESIN-BINDING 1; TRAK1
;;OGT-INTERACTING PROTEIN, 106-KD; OIP106;;
KIAA1042;;
MILTON, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned KIAA1042. The deduced protein
contains 953 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression of
OIP106 in spinal cord and moderate expression in all other tissues and
specific brain regions examined.

By searching a sequence database for homologs of rat Oip98 (ALS2CR3;
607334), Iyer et al. (2003) identified KIAA1042, which they designated
OIP106. OIP106 contains coiled-coil domains. Confocal and electron
microscopy showed that OIP106 colocalized with RNA polymerase II (see
180660) in nuclear puncta in HeLa cells. In vitro translation
synthesized a protein with an apparent molecular mass of about 115 kD by
SDS/PAGE. Western blot analysis detected a 115-kD OIP106 protein in HeLa
cell lysates. Further analysis revealed expression of OIP106 in all cell
lines examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Iyer et al. (2003) found that OIP106 interacted with the
tetratricopeptide repeats of OGT (300255) and was O-glycosylated by OGT.
However, unlike other O-glycosylation substrates, OIP106 formed stable
in vitro and in vivo associations with OGT. Coimmunoprecipitations
confirmed that OIP106 interacts with RNA polymerase II and with OGT in
vivo.

Numerous studies have shown that neuroreceptors, including
gamma-aminobutyric acid type A, or GABA(A), receptors, are not
stationary structures on the cell surface. Instead, they undergo a
constant flux whereby surface-bound receptors are endocytosed to form an
intracellular pool, and receptors in this pool are either recycled back
onto the cell surface or shunted toward lysosome-mediated degradation.
Several pieces of evidence suggest that TRAK1, and perhaps TRAK2
(ALS2CR3; 607334), is involved in this trafficking process. Both TRAK1
and TRAK2 are associated with the motor protein kinesin (see 602809)
(Brickley et al., 2005), and TRAK2 can bind to the beta-2 subunit of
GABA(A) receptors (Beck et al., 2002). Based on these observations,
Gilbert et al. (2006) hypothesized that TRAK1 has a crucial role in
regulating the endocytic trafficking of GABA(A) receptors. TRAK1 may
facilitate the targeting of endocytosed GABA(A) receptors back to the
cell surface or block them from degradation. TRAK1 may also be involved
in directing newly synthesized GABA(A) receptors to the cell surface.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the OIP106
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP stSG4620). Gilbert et al. (2006) stated that
this gene, which they referred to as TRAK1, is located on 3p.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hypertonia, which results from motor pathway defects in the central
nervous system (CNS), is observed in numerous neurologic disorders,
including cerebral palsy, stroke, spinal cord injury, stiff-person
syndrome (184850), spastic paraplegia, dystonia, and Parkinson disease.
Mice with mutation in the 'hypertonic' gene (hyrt) exhibit severe
hypertonia as their primary symptom. Gilbert et al. (2006) showed that
Hyrt mutant mice have much lower levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid type
A, or GABA(A), receptors in their CNS, particularly the lower motor
neurons, than do wildtype mice, indicating that the hypertonicity of the
mutants is likely to be caused by deficits in GABA-mediated motor neuron
inhibition. By linkage analysis they localized the mutant gene
responsible for the hyrt phenotype to mouse chromosome 9 in a region
containing the KIAA1042 gene. Mouse KIAA1042 contains 16 exons and
predicts a protein of 939 amino acids. Sequencing of KIAA1042 in hyrt
homozygotes revealed a 20-bp deletion in the last exon of KIAA1042 that
results in a frameshift after amino acid position 824. Given that the
deletion disrupts only the final 12% of the protein, it may result in
partial loss of function.

NOMENCLATURE

Gilbert et al. (2006) noted that the TRAK1 gene was also referred to as
mammalian Milton (Stowers et al., 2002).

113705	TITLE *113705 BREAST CANCER 1 GENE; BRCA1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BRCA1 plays critical roles in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint control,
and maintenance of genomic stability. BRCA1 forms several distinct
complexes through association with different adaptor proteins, and each
complex forms in a mutually exclusive manner (Wang et al., 2009).

CLONING

Miki et al. (1994) identified cDNA sequences corresponding to the BRCA1
gene by positional cloning of the region on 17q21 implicated in familial
breast-ovarian cancer syndrome (604370). The deduced 1,863-residue
protein with zinc-finger domains near the N terminus. A 7.8-kb mRNA
transcript was identified in testes, thymus, breast and ovary. There
appeared to be a complex pattern of alternative splicing.

Bennett et al. (1995) found that the mouse Brca1 gene shares 75%
identity of the coding region with the human sequence at the nucleotide
level, whereas the predicted amino acid identity was only 58%.

Jensen et al. (1996) demonstrated that BRCA1 encodes a 190-kD protein
with sequence homology and biochemical analogy to members of the granin
protein family, including chromogranin A (118910), chromogranin B
(118920), and secretogranin II, also known as chromogranin C (118930).
They noted that BRCA2 also includes a motif similar to the granin
consensus at the C terminus of the protein. Both BRCA1 and the granins
localize to secretory vesicles, are secreted by a regulated pathway, are
posttranslationally glycosylated, and are responsive to hormones. The
authors stated that as a regulated secretory protein, BRCA1 appears to
function by a mechanism not previously described for tumor suppressor
products. As reviewed by Steeg (1996), granins are a family of acidic
proteins that bind calcium and aggregate in its presence. Known members
of the granin family have been solely neuroendocrine or endocrine in
origin; if BRCA1 is a granin it will necessarily expand the protein
family boundaries.

ElShamy and Livingston (2004) identified a splice variant of BRCA1 that
incorporates a unique 40-nucleotide first exon, exon 1c, that is located
24 Mb upstream of BRCA1 exons 1a and 1b. The 3-prime end of this cDNA
extends 335 nucleotides into intron 11, prompting ElShamy and Livingston
(2004) to designate it IRIS for 'in-frame reading of BRCA1 intron 11
splice variant.' The deduced BRCA1-IRIS protein contains 1,399 amino
acids. In vitro transcription-translation resulted in a protein with an
apparent molecular mass of about 150 kD. Northern blot analysis of
fibroblast mRNA detected BRCA1-IRIS at about 4.5 kb. Semiquantitative
PCR detected variable and developmentally regulated expression of
BRCA1-IRIS and full-length BRCA1 in several adult and fetal human
tissues. Unlike full-length BRCA1, BRCA1-IRIS was exclusively chromatin
associated, failed to interact with BARD1 in vivo or in vitro, exhibited
unique nuclear immunostaining, and coimmunoprecipitated with core DNA
replication initiation sites and with replication initiation proteins.
Suppression of BRCA1-IRIS hindered DNA replication, whereas
overexpression stimulated DNA replication. ElShamy and Livingston (2004)
concluded that endogenous BRCA1-IRIS positively influences the DNA
replication initiation machinery.

GENE STRUCTURE

Miki et al. (1994) determined that the BRCA1 gene contains 22 exons
spanning about 110 kb of DNA.

Brown et al. (1996) determined the detailed structure of the BRCA1
genomic region. They showed that this region of chromosome 17 contains a
tandem duplication of approximately 30 kb which results in 2 copies of
BRCA1 exons 1 and 2, of exons 1 and 3 of the adjacent gene that Brown et
al. (1994) designated 1A1-3B (M17S2; 166945), and of a previously
reported 295-bp intergenic region. Sequence analysis of the duplicated
exons of BRCA1, 1A1-3B, and flanking genomic DNA revealed to Brown et
al. (1996) that there was maintenance of exon/intron structure and a
high degree of nucleotide sequence identity, which suggested that these
duplicated exons are nonprocessed pseudogenes. They noted that these
findings could not only confound BRCA1 mutation analysis but have
implications for the normal and abnormal regulation of BRCA1
transcription, translation, and function.

Smith et al. (1996) sequenced 117,143 bp from human chromosome 17
encompassing BRCA1. The 24 exons of BRCA1 spanned an 81-kb region that
had an unusually high density of Alu repetitive DNA (41.5%), but a
relatively low density (4.8%) of other repetitive sequences. BRCA1
intron lengths ranged in size from 403 bp to 9.2 kb and contained 3
intragenic microsatellite markers located in introns 12, 19, and 20. In
addition to BRCA1, the contig contained 2 complete genes which they
called RHO7 (601555) and VAT1. RHO7 is a member of the RHO family of GTP
binding proteins and VAT1 is an abundant membrane protein of cholinergic
synaptic vesicles. The order of genes on the chromosome was found to be:
centromere-IFP35 (600735)-VAT1-RHO7-BRCA1-M17S2-telomere. Smith et al.
(1996) suggested that these features may contribute to chromosomal
instability or changes in transcription.

MAPPING

The BRCA1 gene maps to human chromosome 17q21 (Miki et al., 1994).
Albertsen et al. (1994) used simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to
construct a high-resolution genetic map of a 40-cM region around 17q21.
For 5 of the markers, genotypes were 'captured' by using an ABI
sequencing instrument and stored in a locally developed database as a
step toward automated genotyping. In a second report, Albertsen et al.
(1994) described construction of a physical map of a 4-cM region
containing the BRCA1 gene. The map comprised a contig of 137 overlapping
YACs and P1 clones, onto which they had placed 112 PCR markers. They
localized more than 20 genes on the map, 10 of which had not been mapped
to the region previously, and isolated 30 cDNA clones representing
partial sequences of as yet unidentified genes. They failed to find any
deleterious mutations on sequencing of 2 genes that lie within a narrow
region defined by meiotic breakpoints in BRCA1 patients. O'Connell et
al. (1994) developed a radiation hybrid map of the BRCA1 region as the
basis of YAC cloning and pulsed field gel electrophoretic mapping of the
candidate region for the BRCA1 gene.

By an intersubspecific backcross using a DNA sequence variant in the
Brca1 locus, Bennett et al. (1995) mapped the Brca1 gene to distal mouse
chromosome 11 in a region of extensive homology of synteny to human
chromosome 17.

Schrock et al. (1996) mapped the Brca1 gene to mouse chromosome 11,
specifically 11D. De Gregorio et al. (1996) mapped the gene to mouse
chromosome 11.

- Pseudogene

The 5-prime end of the BRCA1 gene lies within a duplicated region on
chromosome 17q21. This region contains BRCA1 exons 1A, 1B, and 2 and
their surrounding introns; as a result, a BRCA1 pseudogene lies upstream
of BRCA1. Puget et al. (2002) found extensive homology between the
tandemly situated BRCA1 and its pseudogene. Exon 1A of BRCA1 and of the
pseudogene were 44.5 kb apart. Distinct homologous recombination events
had occurred between intron 2 of BRCA1 and intron 2 of the BRCA1
pseudogene, leading to 37-kb deletions. These breakpoint junctions were
found to be located at close but distinct sites within segments that are
98% identical. The mutant alleles lack the BRCA1 promoter and harbor a
chimeric gene consisting of pseudogene exons 1A, 1B, and 2, which lacks
the initiation codon, fused to BRCA1 exons 3-24. This represented a new
mutational mechanism for the BRCA1 gene. The presence of a large region
homologous to BRCA1 on the same chromosome appeared to constitute a
hotspot for recombination. Brown et al. (2002) likewise identified a
deletion consistent with recombination between BRCA1 and the BRCA1
pseudogene. In germline BRCA1, a promoter deletion was found in 1 of 60
familial breast cancer patients from the Australian population.

GENE FUNCTION

Thompson et al. (1995) found that BRCA1 mRNA levels were markedly
decreased during the transition from carcinoma in situ to invasive
cancer in sporadic breast cancer. Experimental inhibition of BRCA1
expression with antisense oligonucleotides produced accelerated growth
of normal and malignant mammary cells but had no effect on nonmammary
epithelial cells. The results suggested that BRCA1 may normally serve as
a negative regulator of mammary epithelial cell growth and that this
function is compromised in breast cancer either by direct mutation or by
alterations in gene expression.

Chen et al. (1995) identified the BRCA1 gene product as a 220-kD nuclear
phosphoprotein in normal cells, including breast ductal epithelial
cells, and in 18 of 20 tumor cell lines derived from tissues other than
breast and ovary. However, in 16 of 17 breast and ovarian cancer lines
and in 17 of 17 samples of cells obtained from malignant effusions,
BRCA1 localized mainly in the cytoplasm. Absence of BRCA1 or aberrant
subcellular location was also observed to a variable extent in
histologic sections of many breast cancer biopsies. The findings
suggested to the authors that BRCA1 abnormalities may be involved in the
pathogenesis of many breast cancers, sporadic as well as familial.
Scully et al. (1996), however, reported results that did not support the
hypothesis that wildtype BRCA1 is specifically excluded from the nucleus
in sporadic breast and ovarian cancer.

Coene et al. (1997) reported a well-defined localization of BRCA1 in the
perinuclear compartment of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi complex and
in tubes invaginating the nucleus. The nuclear detection was fixation
dependent, which helped to explain the controversial findings previously
reported. The nuclear tubes were not seen in every cell, and therefore
the authors suggested that an involvement in the cell cycle was
possible. These tubes probably enhance nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions
by increasing the surface area.

Chen et al. (1996) raised mouse polyclonal antibodies to 3 regions of
the human BRCA1 protein and confirmed their earlier finding of a 220-kD
nuclear phosphoprotein. They reported that expression and
phosphorylation of the BRCA1 gene and protein are cell cycle dependent
in a synchronized population of bladder carcinoma cells. The greatest
levels of both expression and phosphorylation occurred in S and M
phases.

Chen et al. (1998) used mammalian expression vectors to transfect cells
with BRCA1 and BRCA2 as well as with several antibodies to recognize
these proteins in order to study their subcellular localizations. They
showed that BRCA1 and BRCA2 coexist in a biochemical complex and
colocalize in subnuclear foci in somatic cells and on the axial elements
of developing synaptonemal complexes. Like BRCA1 and RAD51 (179617),
BRCA2 relocates to replication sites following exposure of S phase cells
to hydroxyurea or UV irradiation. Thus, BRCA1 and BRCA2 participate
together in a pathway (or pathways) associated with the activation of
double-strand break repair and/or homologous recombination. Dysfunction
of this pathway may be a general phenomenon in the majority of cases of
hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer.

Zhong et al. (1999) showed that BRCA1 interacts in vitro and in vivo
with RAD50 (604040), which forms a complex with MRE11 (600814) and
p95/nibrin (NBS1; 602667). Upon irradiation, BRCA1 was detected in the
nucleus, in discrete foci which colocalize with RAD50. Formation of
irradiation-induced foci positive for BRCA1, RAD50, MRE11, or p95 was
dramatically reduced in HCC/1937 breast cancer cells carrying a
homozygous mutation in BRCA1 but was restored by transfection of
wildtype BRCA1. Ectopic expression of wildtype, but not mutated, BRCA1
in these cells rendered them less sensitive to the DNA damage agent
methyl methanesulfonate. These data suggested to the authors that BRCA1
is important for the cellular responses to DNA damage that are mediated
by the RAD50-MRE11-p95 complex.

Holt et al. (1996) demonstrated that retroviral transfer of the wildtype
BRCA1 gene inhibits growth in vitro of all breast cancer and ovarian
cancer cell lines tested, but not colon or lung cancer cells or
fibroblasts. Mutant BRCA1, however, had no effect on growth of breast
cancer cells; ovarian cancer cell growth was not affected by BRCA1
mutations in the 5-prime portion of the gene but was inhibited by
3-prime BRCA1 mutations. Development of MCF-7 tumors in nude mice was
inhibited when MCF-7 cells were transfected with wildtype, but not
mutant, BRCA1. Among mice with established MCF-7 tumors, peritoneal
treatment with a retroviral vector expressing wildtype BRCA1
significantly inhibited tumor growth and increased survival. The results
of Holt et al. (1996) were consistent with the previous observation that
the site of BRCA1 mutation is associated with relative susceptibility to
ovarian versus breast cancer.

To identify downstream target genes of BRCA1, Harkin et al. (1999)
established cell lines with tightly regulated inducible expression of
the BRCA1 gene. High-density oligonucleotide arrays were used to analyze
gene expression profiles at various times following BRCA1 induction. A
major target of BRCA1 is the DNA damage-inducible gene GADD45 (126335).
Induction of BRCA1 triggers apoptosis through activation of c-Jun
N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK; see
601158), a signaling pathway potentially linked to GADD45 gene family
members.

Lorick et al. (1999) showed that like other RING finger proteins, the
N-terminal 788 amino acids of BRCA1 expressed as a GST fusion protein
facilitated E2-dependent ubiquitination. The authors noted that RING
mutations in BRCA1 are associated with familial carcinomas.

In an effort to understand the function of BRCA1, Wu et al. (1996) used
a yeast 2-hybrid system to identify proteins that associate with BRCA1
in vivo. This analysis led to the identification of BARD1 (601593), a
novel protein that interacts with the N-terminal region of BRCA1.

By Western and immunofluorescence analyses in synchronized T24 bladder
cancer cells, Jin et al. (1997) studied the expression patterns of the
BARD1 and BRCA1 proteins. They found that the steady state levels of
BARD1, unlike those of BRCA1, remain relatively constant during cell
cycle progression. However, immunostaining revealed that BARD1 resides
within BRCA1 nuclear dots during S phase of the cell cycle, but not
during the G1 phase. Nevertheless, BARD1 polypeptides are found
exclusively in the nuclear fractions of both G1- and S-phase cells.
Therefore, progression to S phase is accompanied by the aggregation of
nuclear BARD1 polypeptides into BRCA1 nuclear dots. This cell
cycle-dependent colocalization of BARD1 and BRCA1 indicates a role for
BARD1 in BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression.

Scully et al. (1997) found that the BRCA1 gene product is a component of
the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (polII) by several criteria. BRCA1 was
found to copurify with the holoenzyme over multiple chromatographic
steps. Other tested transcription activators that could potentially
contact the holoenzyme were not stably associated with the holoenzyme as
determined by copurification. Antibody specific for the holoenzyme
component SRB7 specifically purified BRCA1. (SRB proteins are a key
component of the holoenzyme and were discovered in a yeast genetic
screen as suppressors of RNA polymerase B mutations; hence, the
designation SRB. A benign difference is that SRB proteins bind to the
C-terminal domain of yeast polII and are found only in the polII
holoenzyme.) Immunopurification of BRCA1 complexes also specifically
purified transcriptionally active RNA polII and transcription factors
TFIIF (see 189968), TFIIE (see 189962), and TFIIH (see 189972), which
are known components of the holoenzyme. Moreover, a BRCA1 domain, which
is deleted in about 90% of clinically relevant mutations, participated
in binding to the holoenzyme complex in cells. These data were
considered consistent with other data identifying transcription
activation domains in the BRCA1 protein, and link the BRCA1 tumor
suppressor protein with the transcription process as a holoenzyme-bound
protein.

RNA helicase A, or RHA (140 kD), was identified by Lee and Hurwitz
(1993) and Zhang and Grosse (1997) as a helicase of unknown function
with homology to the Drosophila 'maleless' gene, which functions to
increase expression of genes from the male X chromosome. Anderson et al.
(1998) showed that RHA protein links BRCA1 to the holoenzyme complex.
These results were the first to identify specific protein interaction
with the BRCA1 C-terminal domain and were consistent with the model that
BRCA1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator.

Association of the BRCA1 protein with the DNA repair gene RAD51 (179617)
and changes in the phosphorylation and cellular localization of the
protein after exposure to DNA-damaging agents are consistent with a role
for BRCA1 in DNA repair. Although Gowen et al. (1998) reported that
mouse embryonic stem cells deficient in BRCA1 are defective in the
ability to carry out transcription-coupled repair of oxidative DNA
damage and are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and hydrogen
peroxide, this article was later retracted because of the possibility of
'fabricated and falsified research findings' by one of the authors
(Gowen et al., 2003).

Using transient transfection assays, Fan et al. (1999) demonstrated that
BRCA1 inhibits signaling by the ligand-activated estrogen receptor
ER-alpha (133430) through the estrogen-responsive enhancer element and
blocks the C-terminal transcriptional activation function AF2 of
ER-alpha. These results suggested that wildtype BRCA1 protein may
function, in part, to suppress estrogen-dependent mammary epithelial
proliferation by inhibiting ER-alpha mediated transcriptional pathways
related to cell proliferation, and that loss of this ability may
contribute to tumorigenesis.

Scully et al. (1999) found that retrovirally expressed wildtype BRCA1
decreased the gamma irradiation (IR) sensitivity and increased the
efficiency of double-strand DNA break repair of the BRCA1 -/- human
breast cancer line, HCC1937. It also reduced the susceptibility of the
cells to double-strand DNA break generation by IR. In contrast, multiple
clinically validated BRCA1 products with missense mutations were
nonfunctional in these assays. These data constituted the basis for a
BRCA1 functional assay and suggested that efficient repair of
double-strand DNA breaks is linked to BRCA1 tumor suppression.

BRCA1 contains a C-terminal domain (BRCT) that is shared with several
other proteins involved in maintaining genome integrity. In an effort to
understand the function of BRCA1, Yarden and Brody (1999) sought to
isolate proteins that interact with the BRCT domain. Purified BRCT
polypeptide was used as a probe to screen a human placenta cDNA
expression library by Far Western analysis. The authors reported that
BRCA1 interacts in vivo and in vitro with the Rb-binding proteins RbAp46
(RBBP7; 300825) and RbAp48 (RBBP4; 602923), as well as with Rb (RB1;
614041). Moreover, the BRCT domain associated with the histone
deacetylases HDAC1 (601241) and HDAC2 (605164). These results
demonstrated that BRCA1 interacts with components of the histone
deacetylase complex, and therefore may explain the involvement of BRCA1
in multiple processes such as transcription, DNA repair, and
recombination.

Lee et al. (2000) reported that CHK2 (604373) regulates BRCA1 function
after DNA damage by phosphorylating serine-988 of BRCA1. Lee et al.
(2000) demonstrated that CHK2 and BRCA1 interact and colocalize within
discrete nuclear foci but separate after gamma irradiation.
Phosphorylation of BRCA1 at serine-988 is required for the release of
BRCA1 from CHK2. This phosphorylation is also important for the ability
of BRCA1 to restore survival after DNA damage in the BRCA1-mutated cell
line HCC1937. However, BRCA1 phosphorylation may be complicated. For
example, Cortez et al. (1999) demonstrated that ATM (607585) can
phosphorylate serines at positions 1423 and 1524 of BRCA1 after a high
dose of gamma radiation. In addition, Ruffner et al. (1999) demonstrated
that CDK2 (116953) phosphorylated serine-1497 during the G1/S phase of
cell cycle. Phosphorylation of the different serine residues is likely
to have different effects on BRCA1 function.

Maor et al. (2000) cotransfected a luciferase reporter gene under the
control of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R; 147370)
promoter with a wildtype BRCA1-encoding expression vector into multiple
cell lines. They observed a significant reduction in luciferase activity
in all 3 cell lines tested, demonstrating suppression of promoter
activity by BRCA1 in a dose-dependent manner. Functional interaction
between BRCA1 and SP1 (189906) in the regulation of the IGF1R gene was
studied in Schneider cells, a Drosophila cell line which lacks
endogenous SP1. In these cells, BRCA1 suppressed 45% of the SP1-induced
trans-activation of the IGF1R promoter. Maor et al. (2000) concluded
that BRCA1 is capable of suppressing the IGF1R promoter in a number of
cell lines, resulting in low levels of receptor mRNA protein. Maor et
al. (2000) hypothesized that mutant versions of BRCA1 lacking
trans-activational activity can potentially derepress the IGF1R
promoter. Activation of the overexpressed receptor by locally produced
or circulating IGFs may elicit a myogenic event which may be a key
mechanism in the etiology of breast and ovarian cancer.

Li et al. (2000) demonstrated that the BRCA1-associated protein CTIP
(604124) becomes hyperphosphorylated and dissociated from BRCA1 upon
ionizing radiation. This phosphorylation event requires the protein
kinase ATM (see 607585). ATM phosphorylates CTIP at serine residues 664
and 745, and mutation of these sites to alanine abrogates the
dissociation of BRCA1 from CTIP, resulting in persistent repression of
BRCA1-dependent induction of GADD45 upon ionizing radiation. Li et al.
(2000) concluded that ATM, by phosphorylating CTIP upon ionizing
radiation, may modulate BRCA1-mediated regulation of the DNA
damage-response GADD45 gene, thus providing a potential link between ATM
deficiency and breast cancer.

Using human and mouse expression plasmids in several protein interaction
assays, Sum et al. (2002) identified CTIP and BRCA1 as LMO4
(603129)-binding proteins. The LMO4-BRCA1 interaction required the
C-terminal BRCT domains of BRCA1. LDB1 (603451) also associated with a
complex containing LMO4, CTIP, and BRCA1 in transfected human embryonic
kidney cells. In functional assays, LMO4 repressed BRCA1-mediated
transcriptional activation in both yeast and mammalian cells.

Huttley et al. (2000) used phylogeny-based maximum likelihood analysis
of the BRCA1 sequences from primates and other animals and found that
the ratios of replacement to silent nucleotide substitutions on the
human and chimpanzee lineages were not different from one another but
were different from those of other primate lineages, and were greater
than 1. This is consistent with the historic occurrence of positive
darwinian selection pressure on the BRCA1 protein in the human and
chimpanzee lineages. Analysis of genetic variation in a sample of female
Australians of northern European origin showed evidence for
Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium at polymorphic sites in BRCA1, consistent
with the possibility that natural selection is affecting genotype
frequencies in modern Europeans. The clustering of between-species
variation in the region of the gene encoding the RAD51-interacting
domain of BRCA1 suggests the maintenance of genomic integrity as a
possible target of selection.

Using a combination of affinity- and conventional chromatographic
techniques, Bochar et al. (2000) isolated a predominant form of a
multiprotein BRCA1-containing complex from human cells displaying
chromatin-remodeling activity. Mass spectrometric sequencing of
components of this complex indicated that BRCA1 is associated with a
SWI/SNF-related complex, and the authors showed that BRCA1 can directly
interact with the BRG1 (SMARCA4; 603254) subunit of the SWI/SNF complex.
Moreover, p53 (TP53; 191170)-mediated stimulation of transcription by
BRCA1 was completely abrogated by either a dominant-negative mutant of
BRG1 (Khavari et al., 1993) or the cancer-causing deletion of exon 11 of
BRCA1 (Xu et al., 1999). These findings revealed a direct function for
BRCA1 in transcriptional control through modulation of chromatin
structure.

Ye et al. (2001) found that BRCA1 induced large-scale chromatin
decondensation in Chinese hamster ovary cells. COBRA1 (611180) bound one
of the chromatin-unfolding domains of BRCA1, and by itself COBRA1
induced large-scale chromatin decondensation.

Wang et al. (2000) used immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry
analyses to identify BRCA1-associated proteins. They found that BRCA1 is
part of a large multisubunit protein complex of tumor suppressors, DNA
damage sensors, and signal transducers. They named this complex BASC,
for 'BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex.' Among the DNA repair
proteins identified in the complex were ATM, BLM (604610), MSH2
(609309), MSH6 (600678), MLH1 (120436), the RAD50-MRE11-NBS1 complex,
and the RFC1 (102579)-RFC2 (600404)-RFC4 (102577) complex. Confocal
microscopy demonstrated that BRCA1, BLM, and the RAD50-MRE11-NBS1
complex colocalize to large nuclear foci. Wang et al. (2000) suggested
that BASC may serve as a sensor of abnormal DNA structures and/or as a
regulator of the postreplication repair process.

BRCA1 is implicated in the transcriptional regulation of DNA
damage-inducible genes that function in cell cycle arrest. To explore
the mechanistic basis for this regulation, Zheng et al. (2000) performed
a yeast 2-hybrid screen for proteins associated with BRCA1 and isolated
a cDNA encoding ZBRK1 (605422). ZBRK1 binds to a specific sequence,
GGGxxxCAGxxxTTT, within GADD45 (126335) intron 3 that supports the
assembly of a nuclear complex minimally containing both ZBRK1 and BRCA1.
Through this recognition sequence, ZBRK1 represses transcription in a
BRCA1-dependent manner. The results revealed a novel corepressor
function for BRCA1 and provided a mechanistic basis for the biologic
activity of BRCA1 through sequence-specific transcriptional regulation.

The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway minimizes the potential damage
caused by nonsense mutations. In-frame nonsense codons located at a
minimum distance upstream of the last exon-exon junction are recognized
as premature termination codons, targeting the mRNA for degradation.
Some nonsense mutations cause skipping of one or more exons, presumably
during pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus; this phenomenon is termed
nonsense-mediated altered splicing (NAS). By analyzing NAS in BRCA1, Liu
et al. (2001) showed that inappropriate exon skipping can be reproduced
in vitro and that it results from disruption of a splicing enhancer in
the coding sequence. Enhancers can be disrupted by a single nonsense,
missense, or translationally silent point mutation, without recognition
of an open reading frame as such. These results argued against a nuclear
reading-frame scanning mechanism for NAS. Coding region
single-nucleotide polymorphisms within exonic splicing enhancers or
silencers may affect the patterns or efficiency of mRNA splicing, which
may in turn cause phenotypic variability and variable penetrance of
mutations elsewhere in a gene.

Hedenfalk et al. (2001) used microarray technology to determine
gene-expression profiles in BRCA1-positive breast cancers as contrasted
with BRCA2-positive breast cancers. The suspicion that a difference
might be found came from the fact that the 2 types of tumors are often
histologically distinctive. Furthermore, tumors with BRCA1 mutations are
generally negative for both estrogen and progesterone receptors, whereas
most tumors with BRCA2 mutations are positive for these hormone
receptors. RNA from samples of primary tumors from 7 carriers of the
BRCA1 mutation and 7 carriers of the BRCA2 mutation was compared with a
microarray of 6,512 cDNA clones of 5,361 genes. The authors found that
significantly different groups of genes are expressed by breast cancers
with BRCA1 mutations and breast cancers with BRCA2 mutations.

Garcia-Higuera et al. (2001) showed that a nuclear complex containing
the FANCA (607139), FANCC (227645), FANCF (603467), and FANCG (602956)
proteins is required for the activation of the FANCD2 protein (227646)
to a monoubiquitinated isoform. In normal cells, FANCD2 is
monoubiquitinated in response to DNA damage and is targeted to nuclear
foci (dots). Activated FANCD2 protein colocalizes with BRCA1 in ionizing
radiation-induced foci and in synaptonemal complexes of meiotic
chromosomes. The authors concluded that the FANCD2 protein therefore
provides the missing link between the FA protein complex and the
cellular BRCA1 repair machinery. Disruption of this pathway results in
the cellular and clinical phenotype common to all subtypes of Fanconi
anemia.

The Fanconi anemia (FA) nuclear complex (composed of the FA proteins A,
C, G, and F) is essential for protection against chromosome breakage. It
activates the downstream protein FANCD2 by monoubiquitylation; this then
forges an association with the BRCA1 protein at sites of DNA damage.
Pace et al. (2002) showed that the FANCE (600901) protein is part of
this nuclear complex, binding both FANCC and FANCD2. Indeed, FANCE is
required for the nuclear accumulation of FANCC and provides a critical
bridge between the FA complex and FANCD2. Disease-associated FANCC
mutants do not bind to FANCE, cannot accumulate in the nucleus and are
unable to prevent chromosome breakage.

Paull et al. (2001) demonstrated that recombinant human BRCA1 protein
binds strongly to DNA, an activity conferred by a domain in the center
of the BRCA1 polypeptide. As a result of this binding, BRCA1 inhibits
the nucleolytic activity of the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 complex, an enzyme
implicated in numerous aspects of double-strand break repair. BRCA1
displays a preference for branched DNA structures and forms protein-DNA
complexes cooperatively between multiple DNA strands, but without DNA
sequence specificity.

Mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene (191170) are found in 70 to
80% of BRCA1-mutated breast cancers but only 30% of those with wildtype
BRCA1 (Schuyer and Berns, 1999). The p53 protein regulates nucleotide
excision repair (NER) through transcriptional regulation of genes
involved in the recognition of adducts in genomic DNA. Loss of p53
function, as in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (151623), results in deficient
global genomic repair (GGR), a subset of NER that targets and removes
lesions from the whole genome (Ford and Hanawalt, 1995, 1997). Hartman
and Ford (2002) showed that BRCA1 specifically enhances the GGR pathway,
independent of p53, and can induce p53-independent expression of the NER
genes XPC (613208), DDB2 (600811), and GADD45. Defects in the NER
pathway in BRCA1-associated breast cancers may be causal in tumor
development, suggesting a multistep model of carcinogenesis.

Yarden et al. (2002) showed that BRCA1 is essential for activating the
Chk1 kinase (603078) that regulates DNA damage-induced G2/M arrest.
BRCA1 controls the expression, phosphorylation, and cellular
localization of Cdc25C (157680) and Cdc2/cyclin B kinase
(116940)--proteins that are crucial for the G2/M transition. Since BRCA1
regulates key effectors that control the G2/M checkpoint, it is involved
in regulating the onset of mitosis.

Ganesan et al. (2002) found that BRCA1 colocalized with markers of the
inactive X chromosome (Xi) on Xi in female somatic cells and associated
with XIST (314670) RNA, as detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation.
Breast and ovarian carcinoma cells lacking BRCA1 showed evidence of
defects in Xi chromatin structure. Reconstitution of BRCA1-deficient
cells with wildtype BRCA1 led to the appearance of focal XIST RNA
staining without altering XIST abundance. Inhibiting BRCA1 synthesis in
a suitable reporter line led to increased expression of an otherwise
silenced Xi-located GFP transgene. These observations suggested that
loss of BRCA1 in female cells may lead to Xi perturbation and
destabilization of its silenced state.

Folias et al. (2002) used yeast 2-hybrid analysis and
coimmunoprecipitation methods to demonstrate a direct interaction
between the FANCA and BRCA1 proteins. Direct interaction with other FANC
proteins was not demonstrable. The amino terminal portion of FANCA and
the central part (amino acids 740-1,083) of BRCA1 contained the sites of
interaction. The interaction did not depend on DNA damage, suggesting
that FANCA and BRCA1 may be constitutively interacting.

Yu et al. (2003) demonstrated that the BRCA1 BRCT domain directly
interacts with phosphorylated BRCA1-associated carboxyl-terminal
helicase (BACH1; 602751). The specific interaction between BRCA1 and
phosphorylated BACH1 is cell cycle regulated and is required for DNA
damage-induced checkpoint control during the transition from G2 to M
phase of the cell cycle. Further, Yu et al. (2003) showed that 2 other
BRCT domains interact with their respective physiologic partners in a
phosphorylation-dependent manner. Thirteen additional BRCT domains also
preferentially bind phosphopeptides rather than nonphosphorylated
control peptides. Yu et al. (2003) concluded that their data implied
that the BRCT domain is a phosphoprotein binding domain involved in cell
cycle control.

Dong et al. (2003) isolated a holoenzyme complex containing BRCA1,
BRCA2, BARD1 (601593), and RAD51 (179617), which they called the BRCA1-
and BRCA2-containing complex (BRCC). The complex showed UBC5 (see
UBE2D1; 602961)-dependent ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. Inclusion of BRE
(610497) and BRCC3 (300617) enhanced ubiquitination by the complex, and
cancer-associated truncations in BRCA1 reduced the association of BRE
and BRCC3 with the complex. RNA interference of BRE and BRCC3 in HeLa
cells increased cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation and resulted in a
defect in G2/M checkpoint arrest. Dong et al. (2003) concluded that the
BRCC is a ubiquitin E3 ligase that enhances cellular survival following
DNA damage.

Deng and Wang (2003) discussed the functions of BRCA1 in DNA damage
repair and cellular responses that link development and cancer.

Morris and Solomon (2004) demonstrated an association of cellular BRCA1
with conjugated ubiquitin. The association was apparent at DNA
replication structures in S-phase, following treatment with hydroxyurea,
and at sites of double-strand break repair after exposure to ionizing
radiation. Downregulation of endogenous, cellular BRCA1:BARD1 using
siRNA resulted in abrogation of ubiquitin conjugation in these
structures, suggesting that heterodimer activity may be required for
their formation. Conversely, ectopically expressed full-length BRCA1,
but not BRCA1 bearing specific N-terminal amino acid substitutions, was
able to cooperate with BARD1 to increase ubiquitin conjugation in cells.
Conjugation of ubiquitin in foci was inhibited by the expression of
ubiquitin bearing a lysine-6 mutation, suggesting that the ubiquitin
polymers formed at these sites may be dependent on lysine-6 for linkage.
The authors concluded that BRCA1-directed ligation of ubiquitin occurs
during S-phase and in response to replication stress and DNA damage.

Furuta et al. (2005) found that reduction of BRCA1 by RNA interference
enhanced proliferation and impaired acinus formation in a normal human
mammary epithelial cell line. Depletion of BRCA1 upregulated the
expression of genes involved in proliferation and downregulated genes
involved in differentiation. The C-terminal BRCT domain of BRCA1
appeared to be necessary to induce differentiation. Growth medium that
was conditioned by differentiating normal mammary epithelial cells could
induce differentiation in breast cancer cells with reduced BRCA1
function. Furuta et al. (2005) concluded that BRCA1 is involved in
secretion of certain paracrine/autocrine factors that induce mammary
epithelial cell differentiation in response to extracellular matrix
signals.

Farmer et al. (2005) showed that BRCA1 or BRCA2 (600185) dysfunction
unexpectedly and profoundly sensitizes cells to the inhibition of PARP
(173870) enzymatic activity, resulting in chromosomal instability, cell
cycle arrest, and subsequent apoptosis. The authors suggested that this
seems to be because the inhibition of PARP leads to the persistence of
DNA lesions normally repaired by homologous recombination. Farmer et al.
(2005) concluded that their results illustrate how different pathways
cooperate to repair damage, and suggest that the targeted inhibition of
particular DNA repair pathways may allow the design of specific and less
toxic therapies for cancer.

Joukov et al. (2006) found that the heterodimeric tumor suppressor
complex BRCA1/BARD1 was required for mitotic spindle-pole assembly and
for accumulation of TPX2 (605917), a major spindle organizer, on spindle
poles in both HeLa cells and Xenopus egg extracts. This BRCA1/BARD1
function was centrosome independent, operated downstream of Ran GTPase
(601179), and depended upon BRCA1/BARD1 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.
Joukov et al. (2006) concluded that BRCA1/BARD1 function in mitotic
spindle assembly likely contributes to its role in chromosome stability
control and tumor suppression.

The BRCT repeats of the breast and ovarian cancer predisposition protein
BRCA1 are essential for tumor suppression. Using phosphopeptide affinity
proteomic analysis, Wang et al. (2007) identified a protein, Abraxas
(ABRA1; 611143), that directly binds to the BRCA1 BRCT repeats through a
phospho-ser-X-X-phe motif. Abraxas binds BRCA1 to the mutual exclusion
of BACH1 (602751) and CTIP (604124), forming a third type of BRCA1
complex. Abraxas recruits the ubiquitin-interacting motif
(UIM)-containing protein RAP80 (609433) to BRCA1. Both Abraxas and RAP80
were required for DNA damage resistance, G2/M checkpoint control, and
DNA repair. RAP80 was required for optimal accumulation of BRCA1 on
damaged DNA (foci) in response to ionizing radiation, and the UIM
domains alone were capable of foci formation. Wang et al. (2007)
concluded that the RAP80-Abraxas complex may help recruit BRCA1 to DNA
damage sites in part through recognition of ubiquitinated proteins.

Sobhian et al. (2007) reported the interaction of the BRCA1 BRCT domain
with RAP80, a ubiquitin-binding protein. RAP80 targets a complex
containing the BRCA1-BARD1 (1601593) E3 ligase and the deubiquitinating
enzyme BRCC36 (300617) to MDC1 (607593)-gamma-H2AX (601772)-dependent
lys6- and lys63-linked ubiquitin polymers at double-strand breaks.
Sobhian et al. (2007) stated that these events are required for cell
cycle checkpoint and repair response to ionizing radiation, implicating
ubiquitin chain recognition and turnover in the BRCA1-mediated repair of
double-strand breaks.

Kim et al. (2007) independently reported the identification of RAP80 as
a BRCA1-interacting protein in humans. RAP80 contains a tandem UIM
domain, which is required for its binding with ubiquitin in vitro and
its damage-induced foci formation in vivo. Moreover, Kim et al. (2007)
showed that RAP80 specifically recruits BRCA1 to DNA damage sites and
functions with BRCA1 in G2/M checkpoint control. Kim et al. (2007)
concluded that taken together, their results suggested the existence of
ubiquitination-dependent signaling pathway involved in the DNA damage
response.

Wang et al. (2008) found lower expression of SIRT1 (604479) in mouse and
human BRCA1-associated breast cancers compared with controls. Reduced
Sirt1 expression in Brca1-mutant mice was associated with increased
expression of survivin (BIRC5; 603352), and this expression pattern as
reversed by induced expression of Brca1. Wang et al. (2008) showed that
BRCA1 bound to the SIRT1 promoter and increased SIRT1 expression, which
in turn inhibited survivin expression. Furthermore, inhibition of
Brca1-mutant tumor growth by the anticancer agent resveratrol was
associated with upregulation of Sirt1 activity, followed by reduction in
survivin and apoptosis of the tumor cells.

Using gene conformation analysis with BRCA1 from human breast cancer
cell lines and mouse mammary tissue, Tan-Wong et al. (2008) found that
chromatin loops were imposed on the BRCA1 gene by the juxtaposition of
the promoter and 3-prime terminator regions in addition to internal
sequences. The repressed BRCA1 conformation was predicted to resemble a
4-leaf clover. The interaction between the BRCA1 promoter and terminator
regions was lost upon estrogen stimulation and during lactation
development in the mouse. This activated conformation was predicted to
have 3 loops and a long 3-prime tail. Loop formation was
transcription-dependent, and the terminator region suppressed
estrogen-induced transcription. Tan-Wong et al. (2008) also found that
BRCA1 promoter and terminator interactions varied in different breast
cancer cell lines. The authors concluded that estrogen-induced release
of the terminator region from the promoter allows BRCA1 transcription,
and that defects in BRCA1 chromatin structure may contribute to
dysregulated BRCA1 expression in breast tumors.

Yun and Hiom (2009) identified a role for CTIP in repair of DNA
double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the avian B-cell line DT40. They
established that CTIP is required not only for repair of DSBs by
homologous recombination in S/G2 phase but also for
microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) in G1. The function of CTIP in
homologous recombination, but not MMEJ, is dependent on the
phosphorylation of serine residue 327 and recruitment of BRCA1. Cells
expressing CTIP protein that cannot be phosphorylated at ser327 are
specifically defective in homologous recombination and have a decreased
level of single-stranded DNA after DNA damage, whereas MMEJ remains
unaffected. Yun and Hiom (2009) concluded that their data support a
model in which phosphorylation of ser327 of CTIP as cells enter S phase
and the recruitment of BRCA1 functions as a molecular switch to shift
the balance of DSB repair from error-prone DNA end joining to error-free
homologous recombination.

Morris et al. (2009) reported that BRCA1 is modified by SUMO in response
to genotoxic stress, and colocalizes at sites of DNA damage with SUMO1
(601912), SUMO2 (603042)/SUMO3 (602231), and the SUMO conjugating-enzyme
Ubc9 (601661). PIAS SUMO E3 ligases (PIAS1; 603566 and PIAS4 605989)
colocalize with and modulate SUMO modification of BRCA1, and are
required for BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity in cells. In vitro, SUMO
modification of the BRCA1/BARD1 (601593) heterodimer greatly increases
its ligase activity, identifying it as a SUMO-regulated ubiquitin
ligase. Furthermore, PIAS SUMO ligases are required for complete
accumulation of double-stranded DNA damage repair proteins subsequent to
RNF8 (611685) accrual, and for proficient double-strand break repair.
Morris et al. (2009) concluded that the sumoylation pathway plays a
significant role in mammalian DNA damage response.

Zhu et al. (2011) showed that loss of BRCA1 in mice results in
transcriptional derepression of the tandemly repeated satellite DNA.
Brca1 deficiency is accompanied by a reduction of condensed DNA regions
in the genome and loss of ubiquitylation of histone H2A (see 613499) at
satellite repeats. BRCA1 binds to satellite DNA regions and
ubiquitylates H2A in vivo. Ectopic expression of H2A fused to ubiquitin
reverses the effects of BRCA1 loss, indicating that BRCA1 maintains
heterochromatin structure via ubiquitylation of histone H2A. Satellite
DNA derepression was also observed in mouse and human BRCA1-deficient
breast cancers. Ectopic expression of satellite DNA can phenocopy BRCA1
loss in centrosome amplification, cell-cycle checkpoint defects, DNA
damage, and genomic instability. Zhu et al. (2011) proposed that the
role of BRCA1 in maintaining global heterochromatin integrity accounts
for many of its tumor suppressor functions.

Using mouse embryonic stem cells, Chang et al. (2011) found that
expression of human BRCA1 with the arg1669-to-glu (R1669Q; 113705.0037)
mutation caused upregulation of microRNA-155 (MIR155; 609337) and
reduced embryonic stem cell survival. R1669Q interfered with
differentiation of stem cells into embryoid bodies with distinct cell
layers, which was associated with apoptotic cell death. In situ
hybridization revealed 40-fold upregulation of Mir155 in a subset of
cells from R1699Q embryoid bodies. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses
revealed that MIR155 was upregulated in all cell lines and breast cancer
tumors with BRCA1 deficiency examined. Wildtype BRCA1, but not BRCA1
with the R1669Q substitution, downregulated mouse Mir155 expression by
recruiting Hdac2 (605164) to the Mir155 promoter, resulting in
deacetylation of histones H2a (see 613499) and H3 (see 602810). Chang et
al. (2011) concluded that BRCA1 has a role in the epigenetic control of
MIR155.

To determine whether the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of BRCA1 is
required for tumor suppression, Shakya et al. (2011) generated mice that
express an enzymatically defective Brca1. The enzymatically defective
Brca1 prevented tumor formation to the same degree as did wildtype Brca1
in 3 different genetically engineered mouse models of cancer. In
contrast, a mutation that ablated phosphoprotein recognition by the BRCA
C terminus (BRCT) domains of BRCA1 elicited tumors in each of the 3
genetically engineered mouse models. Thus, Shakya et al. (2011)
concluded that BRCT phosphoprotein recognition, but not the E3 ligase
activity, is required for BRCA1 tumor suppression.

By expression screening, Lee et al. (2012) found that YY1 (600013) was a
potent positive regulator of BRCA1. YY1 directly bound the proximal
promoter region of BRCA1. Expression of Yy1 and Brca1 correlated
positively during the mammary cycle in mouse mammary gland. Expression
of YY1 and BRCA1 correlated positively in histologic examination of
normal human and tumor breast tissue, with generally lower expression of
both proteins in breast cancers. Overexpression of YY1 caused cell cycle
arrest in transfected breast cancer cells and inhibited tumor formation
following injection in nude mice.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Familial Breast-Ovarian Cancer Susceptibility 1

In affected members of 5 of 8 kindreds with hereditary breast-ovarian
cancer linked to chromosome 17q (BROVCA1; 604370), Miki et al. (1994)
identified 5 different heterozygous pathogenic mutations in the BRCA1
gene (see, e.g., 113705.0035). The mutations included an 11-bp deletion,
a 1-bp insertion, a stop codon, a missense substitution, and an inferred
regulatory mutation.

Castilla et al. (1994) found 8 putative disease-causing mutations in the
BRCA1 gene (see, e.g., 113705.0001; 113705.0006; 113705.0013;
113705.0014) in 50 probands with a family history of breast and/or
ovarian cancer. The authors used single-strand conformation polymorphism
(SSCP) analysis on PCR-amplified genomic DNA. The data were considered
consistent with a tumor suppressor model. The heterogeneity of
mutations, coupled with the large size of the gene, indicated that
clinical application of BRCA1 mutation testing would be technically
challenging.

In 10 families with breast-ovarian cancer, Friedman et al. (1994) used
SSCP analysis and direct sequencing to identify 9 different heterozygous
BRCA1 mutations (see, e.g., 113705.0004; 113705.0007-113705.0009). The
mutations in 7 instances led to protein truncation at sites throughout
the gene. A missense mutation, which occurred independently in 2
families, led to loss of a cysteine in the zinc-binding domain. An
intronic single basepair substitution destroyed an acceptor site and
activated a cryptic splice site, leading to a 59-bp insertion and chain
termination. In 4 families with both breast and ovarian cancer, chain
termination mutations were found in the N-terminal half of the protein.

Simard et al. (1994) identified mutations in the BRCA1 gene in 12 of 30
Canadian families with breast-ovarian cancer syndrome (see, e.g.,
113705.0003). Six frameshift mutations accounted for all 12 mutant
alleles, including nucleotide insertions (2 mutations) and deletions (4
mutations). The same 1-bp insertion mutation in codon 1,755 was found in
4 independent families, whereas 4 other families shared a 2-bp deletion
mutation in codons 22 to 23. These families were not known to be
related, but haplotype analysis suggested that the carriers of each of
these mutations had common ancestors.

Futreal et al. (1994) demonstrated allelic loss at the BRCA1 locus in
primary breast and ovarian tumors. Mutations were detected in 3 of 32
breast and 1 of 12 ovarian carcinomas; all 4 mutations were germline
alterations and occurred in cancers of early-onset type. These results
were interpreted as indicating that mutation in the BRCA1 gene may not
be critical to the development of most breast and ovarian cancers that
arise in the absence of a mutant germline allele. This situation is
unlike that in the APC gene (611731), which is involved in both
hereditary polyposis coli and sporadic colorectal cancer, and that of
some other genes involved in both familial and sporadic cancer.

In 4 of 47 sporadic ovarian cancers, Merajver et al. (1995) examined
tumor DNAs by SSCP and found 4 somatic mutations in the BRCA1 gene; all
4 had loss of heterozygosity at a BRCA1 intragenic marker. The findings
supported a tumor-suppressor mechanism for BRCA1; somatic mutation on
one chromosome and LOH on the other may result in inactivation of BRCA1
in some sporadic ovarian cancers.

Since more than 75% of the reported mutations in the BRCA1 gene result
in truncated proteins, Hogervorst et al. (1995) used the protein
truncation test (PTT) to screen for mutations in exon 11 which encodes
61% of the BRCA1 protein. In 45 patients from breast and/or ovarian
cancer families, they found 6 novel mutations: 2 single nucleotide
insertions, 3 small deletions (of 1-5 bp), and a nonsense mutation
identified in 2 unrelated families. Furthermore, they were able to
amplify the remaining coding region by RT-PCR using lymphocyte RNA.
Combined with the protein truncation test, they detected aberrantly
spliced products affecting exons 5 and 6 in 1 of 2 BRCA1-linked families
examined.

Serova et al. (1996) identified mutations in the BRCA1 gene in 16 of 20
families with breast-ovarian cancer, including 1 family with a case of
male breast cancer. Nine of these mutations had not been reported
previously. Most mutations generated a premature stop codon leading to
the formation of a truncated BRCA1 protein of 2 to 88% of the expected
normal length. The RING-finger domain was altered by 2 of the mutations.
A reduced quantity of BRCA1 transcript was associated with 8 of the
mutations. Of the 4 families with no detectable BRCA1 mutation, only 1
was clearly linked to the BRCA1 locus.

Dunning et al. (1997) examined the frequency of 4 polymorphisms in the
BRCA1 gene in a large series of breast and ovarian cancer cases and
matched controls. Due to strong linkage disequilibrium, the 4 sites
generated only 3 haplotypes with a frequency more than 1.3%. The 2 most
common haplotypes had frequencies of 0.57 and 0.32, respectively, and
these frequencies did not differ significantly between patient and
control groups. Dunning et al. (1997) concluded that the most common
polymorphisms of the BRAC1 gene do not make a significant contribution
to breast or ovarian cancer risk. However, the data suggested that a
gln356-to-arg (Q356R) allele may have a different genotype distribution
in breast cancer patients than that in controls; arg356 homozygotes were
more frequent in the control group (p = 0.01), indicating that it may be
protective against breast cancer.

Langston et al. (1996) found germline BRCA1 mutations in 6 of 80 women
in whom breast cancer was diagnosed before the age of 35 and who were
not selected on the basis of family history. Four additional rare
sequence variants of unknown functional significance were also
identified. Two of the mutations and 3 of the rare sequence variants
were found among the 39 women who reported no family history of breast
or ovarian cancer. None of the mutations and only 1 of the rare variants
was identified in a reference population of 73 unrelated subjects.

FitzGerald et al. (1996) obtained similar results in a study of 30 women
with breast cancer before the age of 30: 4 (13%) had chain-terminating
mutations and 1 had a missense mutation in the BRCA1 gene. Two of the 4
Jewish women in this cohort had the 185delAG mutation (113705.0003).
Among 39 Jewish women with breast cancer before the age of 40,
FitzGerald et al. (1996) found that 8 (21%) carried the 185delAG
mutation (95% CI, 9-36%). FitzGerald et al. (1996) concluded that
germline BRCA1 mutations can be present in young women with breast
cancer who do not belong to families with multiple affected members.

Gayther et al. (1996) stated that more than 65 distinct mutations
scattered throughout the coding region of BRCA1 had been detected.

Couch et al. (1996) reported a total of 254 BRCA1 mutations, 132 (52%)
of which were unique. These represented mutations entered into a
database established by the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC). A
total of 221 (87%) of all mutations or 107 (81%) of the unique mutations
are small deletions, insertions, nonsense point mutations, splice
variants, and regulatory mutations that result in truncation or absence
of the BRCA1 protein. A total of 11 disease-associated missense
mutations (5 unique) and 21 variants (19 unique) as yet unclassified as
missense mutations or polymorphisms had been detected. Thirty-five
independent benign polymorphisms had been described. The most common
mutations were 185delAG (113705.0003) and 5382insC (113705.0018), which
accounted for 30 (11.7%) and 26 (10.1%), respectively, of all the
mutations.

Stoppa-Lyonnet et al. (1996) described 2 independent BRCA1 mutations in
a single family. A woman with breast cancer diagnosed at age 25
inherited a deleterious allele from her father. Her mother had ovarian
and breast cancer caused by a separate mutation, which was the basis of
breast cancer in 5 or more of her relatives. The authors pointed out
that the segregation of 2 BRCA1 mutations resulted in the failure to
demonstrate linkage to either chromosome 17 or chromosome 13 and could
lead to the erroneous hypothesis of the involvement of a third locus in
familial breast cancer. Narod et al. (1995) suggested that the fraction
of familial breast cancer that is not accounted for by BRCA1 or BRCA2
may be small.

In a screening of Hungarian breast/ovarian cancer families for germline
mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, Ramus et al. (1997) found 1 individual who
carried the 185delAG mutation (113705.0003) in BRCA1, as well as the
6174delT mutation (600185.0009) in BRCA2. Each mutation had been shown
to have a frequency of approximately 1% in the Ashkenazi Jewish
population. Although the patient was not recorded as having a Jewish
origin, haplotype analysis suggested that both mutations were of the
Ashkenazi type. There was a maternal family history of breast cancer and
the paternal family history was unknown. The patient was found to have
breast cancer at age 48 and ovarian cancer at age 50 years. The ages at
diagnosis and the tumor types were not different from those of patients
with either BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Both mutations were present in 3
different samples from the patient: breast tumor, ovarian tumor, and
lymphocyte DNA. There was no evidence of loss of heterozygosity on
either chromosome 13 or chromosome 17.

Liede et al. (1998) found mutations of both BRCA1 and BRCA2 in a breast
cancer patient of Scottish descent. Grade II adenocarcinoma of the
breast was diagnosed at the age of 35 years. Simultaneous screening by
protein truncation tests of both BRCA genes detected a 2508G-T mutation
of the BRCA1 gene (113705.0023) and a 3295insA mutation of BRCA2
(600185.0011). The patient had both a maternal and a paternal history of
breast cancer. The maternal side contained cases of postmenopausal
breast cancer; the paternal side contained cases of premenopausal breast
cancer. The mother, however, did not have either mutation, suggesting
that both BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations originated from the father
of the proband.

Using a comprehensive screen of the entire BRCA1 coding region, Janezic
et al. (1999) determined the prevalence of BRCA1 alterations in a
population-based series of 107 consecutive ovarian cancer cases
diagnosed in Orange County, California, between March 1, 1994 and
February 28, 1995. The participation rate was 82%. BRCA1 alterations
were sought using the RNase mismatch cleavage assay followed by direct
sequencing. Two truncating mutations, 962del4 (113705.0024) and
3600del11 (113705.0025), were identified. Both patients had a family
history of breast or ovarian cancer. Several novel as well as previously
reported uncharacterized variants were also identified, some of which
were associated with a family history of cancer. Using allele-specific
amplification, Janezic et al. (1999) determined the frequency
distribution of common polymorphisms in the 91 Caucasian cancer cases in
this series and 24 sister controls. The rare form of the Q356R
polymorphism was significantly (p = 0.03) associated with a family
history of ovarian cancer, suggesting that this polymorphism may
influence ovarian cancer risk.

Vallon-Christersson et al. (2001) characterized the effect of C-terminal
germline variants identified in Scandinavian breast and ovarian cancer
families. Seven familial missense mutations, a truncating mutation, 4
missense variants, and 1 in-frame deletion were studied using 2 separate
reporter genes. The authors concluded that transactivation activity may
reflect a tumor-suppressing function of BRCA1 and further support the
role of BRCA1 missense mutations in disease predisposition. A
discrepancy was noted between results from yeast- and mammalian-based
assays, indicating that it may not be possible to unambiguously
characterize variants with the yeast assay alone.

Perrin-Vidoz et al. (2002) assessed the relative amount of transcripts
encoded by BRCA1 alleles harboring 30 different truncating mutations in
lymphoblastoid cell lines established from carriers from breast/ovarian
cancer families. The authors observed that nonsense-mediated decay (NMD)
was triggered by 80% of alleles containing a premature termination codon
(PTC) and resulted in a 1.5- to 5-fold reduction in mRNA abundance. All
truncating mutations located in the 3.4-kb long central exon were
subject to NMD, irrespective of their distance to the downstream
exon-exon junction. PTCs not leading to NMD were either located in the
last exon or very close to the translation initiation codon.
Perrin-Vidoz et al. (2002) hypothesized that reinitiation could explain
why transcripts carrying early PTCs escape NMD.

Rostagno et al. (2003) performed mutation analysis of the BRCA1 gene in
140 families from the southeast of France with a history of breast
and/or ovarian cancer. As expected, BRCA1 gene alteration, including
missense mutations of unknown biologic significance, were more frequent
in families with a history of breast-ovarian cancer (32%) than in
breast-cancer-only families (12%).

The Scottish/Northern Irish BRCA1/BRCA2 Consortium (2003) identified 107
families in Scotland or Northern Ireland with mutations in the BRCA1 or
BRCA2 genes: 59 had BRCA1 mutations and 46 had BRCA2 mutations. Two
families had mutations in both genes. The most common mutations were the
BRCA1 2800delAA mutation (113705.0008) in 11 families and the BRCA2
6503delTT mutation (600185.0002) in 12 families. Prevalence of breast
cancer was similar for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation families (average 3.7
and 3.6 per family, respectively), but those with BRCA1 mutations had a
much greater risk of ovarian cancer (average 1.5 and 0.6 per family,
respectively). Mutations within the 5-prime two-thirds of BRCA1 carried
a significantly higher relative risk of ovarian cancer, and the same was
true for mutations within the central portion of BRCA2 (the 'OCCR').

Among 349 Belgian families with breast-ovarian cancer, Claes et al.
(2004) found that 49 had BRCA1 mutations and 26 had BRCA2 mutations.
Male breast cancer was significantly indicative of a BRCA2 mutation.
Mutations in the 5-prime ends of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were associated with a
significantly increased risk of ovarian cancer relative to the center
portion of the gene.

In 64 Chilean families with breast-ovarian cancer, Jara et al. (2006)
found that 7 (10.9%) carried mutations in the BRCA1 gene and 3 (4.7%)
carried mutations in the BRCA2 gene. Only 2 families had the same BRCA1
mutation, indicating heterogeneity in the spectrum of BRCA mutations in
this population.

Among 300 US probands from high-risk families who tested negative for
BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations by conventional testing, Walsh et al.
(2006) identified 31 with genomic rearrangements of BRCA1 and 4 with
genomic rearrangements of BRCA2, totaling 35 (12%) of 300. Inherited
rearrangements of BRCA1 or BRCA2 were found in a larger proportion of
families with ovarian and/or male breast cancer (18%) than in those with
only female breast cancer (4.2%). Fourteen probands (4%) had mutations
in the CHEK2 gene (604373), and 3 (1%) had mutations in p53 (191170).

By analysis of BRCA1 mutations in the BIC database, Pavlicek et al.
(2004) showed that distribution of reported missense mutations, but not
frameshift and nonsense mutations, was positively correlated with BRCA1
protein conservation. Based on protein sequence conservation, they
identified missense changes that are likely to compromise BRCA1
function.

Easton et al. (2007) undertook a systematic genetic assessment of 1,433
sequence variants of unknown clinical significance in the BRCA1 and
BRCA2 breast cancer predisposition genes. Easton et al. (2007)
identified 43 sequence variants with odds greater than 20 to 1 in favor
of causality of breast cancer in BRCA1 and 17 in BRCA2. A total of 133
variants of unknown clinical significance had odds of at least 100 to 1
in favor of neutrality with respect to risk. Those with evidence in
favor of causality were predicted to affect splicing, fell at positions
that are highly conserved among BRCA orthologs, and were more likely to
be located in specific domains of the proteins.

Wang et al. (2010) genotyped 3,451 BRCA1 and 2,006 BRCA2 mutation
carriers at 350 SNPs identified as candidate breast cancer risk factors
in 2 breast cancer genomewide association studies (GWAS). Eight SNPs in
BRCA1 carriers and 12 SNPs in BRCA2 carriers, representing an enrichment
over the number expected, were significantly associated with breast
cancer risk. The minor alleles of dbSNP rs6138178 in SNRPB (182282) and
dbSNP rs6602595 in CAMK1D (607957) displayed the strongest associations
in BRCA1 carriers (p(trend) = 3.6 x 10(-4), 95% CI 0.69-0.90 and
p(trend) = 4.2 x 10(-4), 95% CI 1.10-1.41, respectively). The magnitude
and direction of the associations were consistent with the original
GWAS. In subsequent risk assessment studies, the loci appeared to
interact multiplicatively for breast cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2
carriers.

- Prostate Cancer

In Icelandic studies, Arason et al. (1993) suggested that male carriers
of the BRCA1 gene may have an increased risk of prostate cancer.
Langston et al. (1996) studied the BRCA1 gene in 61 men who met one or
more of these criteria: (1) under 53 years of age at diagnosis prostate
cancer; (2) a family history of breast cancer in a first-degree female
relative diagnosed under 51 years of age; or (3) a family history of
prostate cancer in 2 or more male relatives, with at least 1 relative
diagnosed at less than 56 years of age. They found 1 germline mutation,
185delAG (113705.0003), in 1 subject and 5 different rare sequence
variants (1 of which was detected in 2 unrelated men). None of the rare
variants were found in population-based controls. Isaacs et al. (1995)
failed to identify a significantly increased risk of breast cancer among
relatives of prostate cancer probands. The findings of Langston et al.
(1996) are not necessarily in conflict, since the contribution of
germline BRCA1 mutations to the overall incidence of prostate cancer
appears to be small, at most, and may be limited to specific subgroups
of patients.

Nastiuk et al. (1999) set out to determine whether the common germline
mutations of BRCA1 (113705.0003) or BRCA2 (600185.0009), which are
frequent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, predispose Ashkenazi Jewish
men to prostate cancer. They found that each of these germline mutations
occurred at an incidence in prostate cancer patients that closely
matched that in the general Ashkenazi Jewish population. They suggested
that unlike cases of breast and ovarian cancers, mutations in BRCA1 or
BRCA2 do not significantly predispose men to prostate cancer. Vazina et
al. (2000) also concluded that BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations that
are common in Jewish populations probably contribute little to the
occurrence of cancer of the prostate, to inherited predisposition, or to
early-onset disease in Jewish individuals.

In 940 Ashkenazi Israelis with prostate cancer, Giusti et al. (2003)
tested DNA obtained from paraffin sections for the 3 Jewish founder
mutations: 185delAG (113705.0003) and 5382insC (113705.0018) in BRCA1
and 6174delT (600185.0009) in BRCA2. They estimated that there is a
2-fold increase in BRCA mutation-related prostate cancer among Ashkenazi
Israelis. No differences were noted between the histopathologic features
of cases with or without founder mutations, and no difference was found
in the mean age at diagnosis between cases with or without a founder
mutation.

- Other Cancers

Al-Sukhni et al. (2008) found loss of heterozygosity at the BRCA1 locus
in pancreatic tumor DNA from 5 (71%) of 7 patients with pancreatic
cancer (see 614320) who carried a heterozygous germline BRCA1 mutation
(see, e.g., 113705.0003 and 113705.0018). Pancreatic tumor DNA was
available for sequencing in 4 cases, and 3 demonstrated loss of the
wildtype allele. In contrast, only 1 (11%) of 9 patients with sporadic
pancreatic cancer and no germline BRCA1 mutations showed LOH at the
BRCA1 locus. Al-Sukhni et al. (2008) concluded that BRCA1 germline
mutations likely predispose to the development of pancreatic cancer, and
suggested that individuals with these mutations be considered for
pancreatic cancer-screening programs.

- Mutation Detection Methodology

Hacia et al. (1996) noted that all of the then-current methods used to
detect BRCA1 mutations began with PCR amplification and required gel
electrophoresis, which seriously complicated the challenge of scale-up,
automation, and cost reduction. They demonstrated the feasibility of
using oligonucleotide arrays in a DNA chip-based assay to screen for a
wide range of heterozygous mutations in the 3.45-kb exon 11 of the BRCA1
gene. They concluded that DNA chip-based assays provided a valuable new
technology for high throughput, cost-efficient detection of genetic
alterations.

The detection of inactivating mutations in tumor suppressor genes is
critical to their characterization, as well as to the development of
diagnostic testing. Most approaches for mutational screening of germline
specimens are complicated by the fact that mutations are heterozygous
and that missense mutations are difficult to interpret in the absence of
information about protein function. Ishioka et al. (1997) described a
novel method using Saccharomyces cerevisiae for detecting
protein-truncating mutations in any gene of interest. In their
procedure, the PCR-amplified coding sequence of the gene is inserted by
homologous recombination into a yeast URA3 fusion protein, and
transformants are assayed for growth in the absence of uracil. The high
efficiency of homologous recombination in yeast ensures that both
alleles are represented among transformants and achieves separation of
alleles, which facilitates subsequent nucleotide sequencing of the
mutated transcript. The specificity of translational initiation of the
URA3 gene leads to minimal enzymatic activity in transformants harboring
an inserted stop codon, and hence to reliable distinction between
specimens with wildtype alleles and those with a heterozygous truncating
mutation. This yeast-based codon assay accurately detected heterozygous
truncating mutations in the BRCA1 gene in patients with early onset of
breast cancer and in the APC gene (611731) in patients with familial
adenomatous polyposis.

Petrij-Bosch et al. (1997) reported that the mutation spectrum of BRCA1
available at that time had been biased by PCR-based mutation-screening
methods, such as SSCP, the protein truncation test (PPT), and direct
sequencing, using genomic DNA as template. Three large genomic deletions
that were not detectable by those approaches comprised 36% of all BRCA1
mutations found in Dutch breast cancer families up to that time. A
510-bp Alu-mediated deletion comprising exon 22 was found in 8 of 170
breast cancer families recruited for research purposes and in 6 of 49
probands referred to the Amsterdam Family Cancer Clinic for genetic
counseling. In addition, a 3,835-bp Alu-mediated deletion encompassing
exon 13 was detected in 4 of the 170 research families, while a deletion
of approximately 14 kb was detected in a single family. Haplotype
analyses indicated that each recurrent mutation had a single common
ancestor.

Van Orsouw et al. (1999) reported an inexpensive system for mutation
analysis based on a combination of multiplex PCR amplification and
2-dimensional electrophoresis. In a panel of 60 samples, 14 mutations
were confirmed, and an additional 5 mutations were found. Fifteen
different polymorphic variants were also identified.

Montagna et al. (2003) applied multiplex ligation-dependent probe
amplification (MLPA) methodology to 37 hereditary breast-ovarian cancer
families. All had a high prior probability of BRCA1 mutation, and 15
were previously shown to carry a mutation in either the BRCA2 gene (5
families) or the BRCA1 gene (10 families, including 1 genomic
rearrangement). The application of BRCA1 MLPA to the remaining 22
uninformative families allowed the identification of 5 additional
genomic rearrangements. Loss of constitutive heterozygosity of
polymorphic markers in linkage disequilibrium was predictive of such
BRCA1 alterations. BRCA1 genomic deletions accounted for more than
one-third (6 of 15) of the pathogenic BRCA1 mutations in this series.

Using a method that combines sequence alignment with calculation of
Grantham variation and deviation (A-GVGD), Tavtigian et al. (2006)
analyzed most of the missense substitutions observed in BRCA1 and
resolved known neutral and deleterious missense substitutions into
distinct sets. In addition, 8 previously unclassified BRCA1 missense
substitutions observed in trans with 1 or more deleterious mutations,
and within the cross-species range of variation observed at their
position in the protein, were classified as neutral. Tavtigian et al.
(2006) stated that these combined methods can classify as neutral about
50% of missense substitutions that have been observed with 2 or more
clearly deleterious mutations.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Gayther et al. (1995) analyzed 60 families with a history of breast
and/or ovarian cancer for germline mutations in BRCA1. In 32 families
(53%), a total of 22 different mutations were detected, of which 14 were
previously unreported. They observed a significant correlation between
the location of the mutation in the gene and the ratio of breast to
ovarian cancer incidence within the family. The data suggested to the
authors a transition in risk such that mutations in the 3-prime third of
the gene are associated with a lower proportion of ovarian cancer.
Haplotype analysis supported previous data suggesting that some BRCA1
mutation carriers have common ancestors; however, Gayther et al. (1995)
found at least 2 examples where recurrent mutations appeared to have
arisen independently, judging from the different haplotype background.

Studies of a number of diseases have indicated that fine-structure
haplotype analysis can provide insight into the 'genetic history' of a
particular mutation (or presumed mutation for rare diseases where the
disease gene is not yet identified). To address both the question of
mutation origin and the relationship between mutation and phenotype,
Neuhausen et al. (1996) constructed a haplotype of 9 polymorphic STR
markers within or immediately flanking the BRCA1 locus in a set of 61
families (selected to contain 1 of 6 BRCA1 mutations that had been
identified a minimum of 4 times). The mutation appeared to have an
effect on the relative proportion of cases of breast and ovarian cancer:
57% of women presumed affected because of the 1294del40 mutation
(113705.0006) had ovarian cancer, compared with 14% of affected women
with the splice site mutation in intron 5 of BRCA1 (113705.0034). A high
degree of haplotype conservation across the region was observed. Any
haplotype differences found were most often due to mutations in the
short-tandem-repeat markers, although some likely instances of
recombination also were observed. One mutation, 4184del4 (113705.0015),
had the same ancestral haplotype in two-thirds of the families studied.
Neuhausen et al. (1996) estimated that this mutation had arisen 170
generations ago.

To determine whether hereditary ovarian cancers have distinct clinical
and pathologic features compared with sporadic (nonhereditary) ovarian
cancers, Boyd et al. (2000) performed a retrospective cohort study of a
consecutive series of 933 ovarian cancers diagnosed and treated at the
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. This study was restricted to patients of
Jewish origin because of the ease of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genotyping in this
ethnic group. Of the 189 patients who identified themselves as Jewish,
88 hereditary cases were identified with the presence of a germline
founder mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. The remaining 101 cases from the
same series not associated with a BRCA mutation, and 2 additional groups
with ovarian cancer from clinical trials (for survival analysis), were
included for comparison. Hereditary cancers were rarely diagnosed before
age 40 years and were common after age 60 years, with mean age at
diagnosis being significantly younger for BRCA1- versus BRCA2-linked
patients (54 vs 62 years). Histology, grade, stage, and success of
cytoreductive surgery were similar for hereditary and sporadic cases.
The hereditary group had a longer disease-free interval following
primary chemotherapy in comparison with the nonhereditary group, with a
median time to recurrence of 14 months and 7 months, respectively (p
less than 0.001). Those with hereditary cancers had improved survival
compared with the nonhereditary group. Boyd et al. (2000) concluded that
although BRCA-associated hereditary ovarian cancers in this population
have surgical and pathologic characteristics similar to those of
sporadic cancers, advanced-stage hereditary cancer patients survive
longer than nonhereditary cancer patients. Age penetrance is greater for
BRCA1-linked than for BRCA2-linked cancers in this population.

Hohenstein and Fodde (2003) reviewed genotype/phenotype correlations at
the BRCA1 locus in humans and mice.

Basal-like breast cancer is a subtype of breast cancer that is highly
proliferative, poorly differentiated, and has a poor prognosis. These
tumor cells express cytokeratin markers typical of basally oriented
epithelial cells of the normal mammary gland. Saal et al. (2008) found
that loss of PTEN (601728) protein expression was significantly
associated with the basal-like cancer subtype in both nonhereditary
breast cancer and hereditary BRCA1-deficient breast cancer. Loss of PTEN
in the BRCA1-deficient basal-like breast cancer tumors was associated
with frequent gross PTEN mutations, including intragenic chromosome
breaks, inversions, deletions, and micro copy number alterations,
consistent with a mechanism involving inappropriate repair of
double-strand DNA breaks. The findings indicated a specific and
recurrent oncogenic consequence of BRCA1-dependent dysfunction in DNA
repair and implied that the PTEN pathway is directly involved in
transformation of basal-like progenitor cells.

EVOLUTION

To establish the role of missense changes in the BRCA1 gene in breast
cancer susceptibility, Fleming et al. (2003) used comparative
evolutionary methods to identify potential functionally important amino
acid sites in exon 11. By aligning sequences from 57 eutherian mammals
and categorizing amino acid sites by degree of conservation, they
identified 41 missense mutations in exon 11 (38 in conserved and 3 in
rapidly evolving regions) likely to influence gene function and thereby
contribute to breast cancer susceptibility. They used Bayesian
phylogenetic analyses to determine relationships among orthologs and
identify codons evolving under positive selection. Most conserved
residues occurred in a region with the highest concentration of
protein-interacting domains. Rapidly evolving residues were concentrated
in the RAD51-interacting domain, suggesting that selection is acting
most strongly on the role of BRCA1 in DNA repair.

Pavlicek et al. (2004) isolated and characterized full-size BRCA1
homologs from rhesus macaque, orangutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee.
Analysis of human and nonhuman primate BRCA1 sequence revealed an
unusually high proportion of insertion/deletions in noncoding DNA that
were associated with Alu repeats. Most Alu elements involved in genomic
rearrangement in humans were retained in nonhuman primates, indicating
that structural instability of this locus may be intrinsic in
anthropoids. Analysis of the nonsynonymous/synonymous mutation ratio in
BRCA1 coding sequence showed that most of the internal sequence is
variable between primates and evolved under positive selection. In
contrast, the terminal regions of BRCA1, which encode the RING finger
and BRCT domains, experienced negative selection and are almost
identical between the compared primates.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gowen et al. (1996) described homozygous mice lacking the mouse Brca1
gene. The mice, possessing a deletion of the large exon 11, died between
days 10 and 13 of embryonic development, suffering from a variety of
neuroepithelial defects. Hakem et al. (1996) described another strain of
homozygous mice for a putative Brca1-null mutation produced by targeted
deletion of exons 5 and 6. These mutant mice were more severely
affected, dying at about embryonic day 7.5 with no signs of mesoderm
formation and exhibiting reduced cell proliferation. There were also
strong signs of disruptive cell cycle regulation via altered expression
levels of cyclin E (123837), mdm2 (164785) and p21 (116899). Hakem et
al. (1996) speculated that the death of mutant embryos was due to
failure of the proliferative burst required for germ layer development.
Hakem et al. (1996) reported that after about 1 year of age, Brca1
heterozygous female mice showed no evidence of cancer. Gowen et al.
(1996) also had been unable to detect tumors in 1-year-old
heterozygotes.

To study mechanisms underlying BRCA1-related tumorigenesis, Xu et al.
(1999) derived mouse embryonic fibroblast cells carrying a targeted
deletion of exon 11 of the Brca1 gene. The mutant cells maintained an
intact G1-S cell cycle checkpoint and proliferated poorly. However, a
defective G2-M checkpoint in these cells was accompanied by extensive
chromosomal abnormalities. Mutant fibroblasts contained multiple
functional centrosomes, leading to unequal chromosome segregation,
abnormal nuclear division, and aneuploidy. These data uncovered an
essential role for BRCA1 in maintaining genetic stability through the
regulation of centrosome duplication and the G2-M checkpoint.

Moynahan et al. (1999) reported that Brca1-deficient mouse embryonic
stem cells had impaired repair of chromosomal double-strand breaks by
homologous recombination. The relative frequencies of homologous and
nonhomologous DNA integration and double-strand break repair were also
altered. The results demonstrated a caretaker role for BRCA1 in
preserving genomic integrity by promoting homologous recombination and
limiting mutagenic nonhomologous repair processes.

Hakem et al. (1997) generated mice double mutant for Brca1(5-6) and p53,
or Brca1(5-6) and p21. Mutation in either p53 or p21 prolonged the
survival of Brca1(5-6) mutant embryos from embryonic day 7.5 to
embryonic day 9.5. The development of most Brca1(5-6)/p21 double-mutant
embryos was comparable to that of their wildtype littermates, although
no mutant survived past embryonic day 10.5. Because mutation of neither
p53 nor p21 completely rescued Brca1(5-6) embryos, the authors suggested
that the lethality of the embryos is likely due to a multifactorial
process.

Ludwig et al. (1997) created mice deficient for Brca1 by targeted
disruption, resulting in deletion of exon 2. They also disrupted Brca2
by replacing a segment of exon 11. Heterozygotes were indistinguishable
from wildtype littermates. Nullizygous embryos became developmentally
retarded and disorganized, and died early in development. In Brca1
mutants, the onset of abnormalities was earlier by 1 day and their
phenotypic features and time of death were highly variable, whereas the
phenotype of Brca2-null embryos was more uniform, and they survived for
at least 8.5 embryonic days. Brca1/Brca2 double mutants were similar to
Brca1-null mutants. Ludwig et al. (1997) reported that the impact of
Brca1- or Brca2-null mutation was less severe in a p53-null background.

Xu et al. (2001) found that mouse embryos homozygous for deletion of
exon 11 of the Brca1 gene died late in gestation because of widespread
apoptosis. Elimination of 1 p53 allele completely rescued this embryonic
lethality and restored normal mammary gland development. However, most
female mice homozygous for the Brca1 exon 11 deletion and heterozygous
for loss of the p53 gene developed mammary tumors with loss of the
remaining p53 allele within 6 to 12 months. Lymphomas and ovarian tumors
also occurred at lower frequencies. Heterozygous mutation of the p53
gene decreased p53 and resulted in attenuated apoptosis and G1-S
checkpoint control, allowing the homozygous Brca1 exon 11-deleted cells
to proliferate. The p53 protein regulates Brca1 transcription both in
vitro and in vivo, and Brca1 participates in p53 accumulation after
gamma irradiation. These findings provided a mechanism for
BRCA1-associated breast carcinogenesis.

McCarthy et al. (2003) determined that mouse embryos with double mutant
Bard1 -/- ; Brca1 -/- genotype were phenotypically indistinguishable
from either single Bard1 or single Brca1 homozygous mutants. Embryos
that carried at least 1 wildtype allele of both Bard1 and Brca1 were
normal and had 20 to 25 somites, while each embryo that was null for
either Bard1 or Brca1 exhibited the characteristic phenotype of severe
growth retardation, degeneration, and embryonic lethality. The
similarity of phenotypes indicated to McCarthy et al. (2003) that the
developmental functions of Brca1 and Bard1 are mediated by the
Brca1/Bard1 heterodimer.

Mouse embryonic fibroblasts carrying targeted deletion of exon 11 of the
Brca1 gene or a Gadd45a null mutation suffer centrosome amplification.
Wang et al. (2004) found that mouse embryos carrying both mutations were
exencephalic and exhibited a high incidence of apoptosis accompanied by
altered levels of Bax (600040), Bcl2 (151430), and p53. They concluded
that BRCA1 and GADD45A have a synergistic role in regulating centrosome
duplication and maintaining genome integrity.

Poole et al. (2006) demonstrated that mammary glands of nulliparous
Brca1/p53-deficient mice accumulate lateral branches and undergo
extensive alveologenesis, a phenotype that occurs only during pregnancy
in wildtype mice. Progesterone receptors, but not estrogen receptors,
are overexpressed in the mutant mammary epithelial cells because of a
defect in their degradation by the proteasome pathway. Treatment of
Brca1/p53-deficient mice with the progesterone antagonist mifepristone
(RU 486) prevented mammary tumorigenesis. Poole et al. (2006) concluded
that their findings revealed a tissue-specific function for the BRCA1
protein and raised the possibility that antiprogesterone treatment may
be useful for breast cancer prevention in individuals with BRCA1
mutations.

Shakya et al. (2008) found that conditional inactivation of Bard1 in
mouse mammary epithelial cells induced basal-like mammary carcinomas
with a frequency, latency, and histopathology indistinguishable from
those developed in conditional Brca1-mutant mice and in double
conditional Bard1/Brca1-mutant mice. Reminiscent of human breast
carcinomas due to BRCA1 mutation, the mouse tumors were triple negative
for estrogen receptor (see 133430) and progesterone receptor (PGR;
607311) expression and Her2/neu (ERBB2; 164870) amplification. They also
expressed basal cytokeratins Ck5 (KRT5; 148040) and Ck14 (KRT14;
148066), had elevated frequency of p53 lesions, and displayed high
levels of chromosomal instability. Shakya et al. (2008) concluded that
the tumor suppressor activities of both BARD1 and BRCA1 are mediated
through the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer.

In a kindred in which 8 members had breast cancer and 5 members had
ovarian cancer (604370), Castilla et al. (1994) found a TGT-to-GGT
transversion in codon 64 leading to substitution of glycine for
cysteine. Analysis of tumor DNA in 2 affected members of this kindred
showed that the wildtype allele had been lost and only the cys64-to-gly
mutant allele remained, thus supporting the tumor suppressor model.

Gorski et al. (2000) identified a cys61-to-gly (C61G) mutation in the
BRCA1 gene to be a founder mutation in Polish families with
breast-ovarian cancer (604370), accounting for 20% of identified
mutations. They studied 66 families in which at least 3 related females
were affected with breast or ovarian cancer and at least 1 of these 3
had been diagnosed with cancer before the age of 50. Mutations were
identified in 35 (53%) of the 66 families.

Merajver et al. (1995) analyzed genomic DNA of tumor and normal
fractions of 47 ovarian cancers for mutations in BRCA1 using the SSCP
technique. Somatic mutations in the BRCA1 gene were identified in 4
tumors, all of which also had loss of heterozygosity at a BRCA1
intragenic marker. One of these, found in an endometrioid ovarian
carcinoma in a 53-year-old woman, was a C61G substitution in the zinc
finger motif. The data supported a tumor-suppressor mechanism for BRCA1.

BREAST-OVARIAN CANCER SUSCEPTIBILITY

Simard et al. (1994) studied 30 Canadian families with breast and/or
ovarian cancer (604370) for germline mutations in the coding region of
the BRCA1 candidate gene. They identified a 2-bp (AG185) deletion in the
normal sequence TTA GAG of codons 22-23 in exon 3. The AGAG presumably
predisposed to the deletion. This mutation changes the reading frame of
the mRNA and causes a premature termination codon at position 39. This
mutation was detected in index cases from 4 families that were not known
to be related and originated from different areas in Canada. In these 4
families there were a total of 12 cases of breast cancer and 11 cases of
ovarian cancer.

Struewing et al. (1995) pointed out that all 10 published families with
the 185delAG mutation (also called 187delAG) were Ashkenazi Jewish (of
Eastern European origin). They knew of an eleventh Ashkenazi
breast/ovarian cancer family with the 185delAG mutation; furthermore,
only 1 Ashkenazi Jewish family was known to have a BRCA1 mutation other
than 185delAG. In addition, Ashkenazi families with the 185delAG
mutation appeared to share a common haplotype. In a study of 858
Ashkenazim seeking genetic testing for conditions unrelated to cancer,
they observed the 185delAG mutation in 0.9% (95% confidence limit,
0.4%-1.8%), and in 815 reference individuals not selected for ethnic
origin, none had the mutation.

Roa et al. (1996) found the 185delAG mutation in 1.09% of approximately
3,000 Ashkenazi Jewish individuals and found the 5382insC mutation
(113705.0018) in 0.13%. BRCA2 analysis on 3,085 individuals from the
same population showed a carrier frequency of 1.52% for the 6174delT
mutation (600185.0009). The expanded population-based study confirmed
that the BRCA1 185delAG mutation and the BRCA2 6174delT mutation
constituted the 2 most frequent mutant alleles predisposing to
hereditary breast cancer among Ashkenazim and suggested a relatively
lower penetrance for the 6174delT mutation in BRCA2.

Bar-Sade et al. (1997) examined 639 unrelated healthy Jews of Iraqi
extraction, a presumed low-risk group for the 185delAG mutation which
occurs predominantly in Ashkenazim. Three individuals were identified as
185delAG mutation carriers, and haplotype analysis of the Iraqi mutation
carriers showed that 2 of the Iraqis shared a haplotype in common with 6
Ashkenazi mutation carriers, and a third had a haplotype that differed
by a single marker. This suggested to Bar-Sade et al. (1997) that the
BRCA1 185delAG mutation may have arisen before the dispersion of the
Jewish people in the Diaspora, at least at the time of Christ.

Bar-Sade et al. (1998) extended their analyses to other non-Ashkenazi
subsets: 354 of Moroccan origin, 200 Yemenites, and 150 Iranian Jews.
Four of Moroccan origin (1.1%) and none of the Yemenites or Iranians
were carriers of the 185delAG mutation. BRCA1 allelic patterns
(haplotypes) were determined for 4 of these individuals and for 12
additional non-Ashkenazi 185delAG mutation carriers who had
breast/ovarian cancer. The common 'Ashkenazi haplotype' was shared by 6
non-Ashkenazi individuals; 4 had a closely related pattern, and the rest
(n = 6) displayed a distinct BRCA1 allelic pattern. The authors
concluded that the 185delAG BRCA1 mutation occurs in some non-Ashkenazi
populations at rates comparable with that of Ashkenazim. The majority of
Jewish 185delAG mutation carriers have the same haplotype, supporting
the founder effect notion, but dating the mutation's origin to an
earlier date than previously estimated. The different allelic pattern at
the BRCA1 locus in some Jewish mutation carriers might suggest that the
mutation arose independently.

Bandera et al. (1998) demonstrated the 185delAG mutation in 2 women with
a personal or family history of breast cancer and papillary serous
carcinoma of the peritoneum (PSCP). PSCP is histologically
indistinguishable from serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma and it may
develop years after oophorectomy. Schorge et al. (1998) demonstrated
that the tumors were multifocal in these cases, indicating that patients
with germline BRCA1 mutations may develop PSCP in addition to breast and
ovarian carcinomas.

Ah Mew et al. (2002) reported the 185delAG mutation in a non-Jewish
Chilean family with no reported Jewish ancestry. The linked haplotype
present in this family was identical to that identified in the Ashkenazi
Jewish population.

Buisson et al. (2006) found that BRCA1 transcripts bearing the 185delAG
mutation are not degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Using Western
blot analysis, they examined HeLa cells transfected with minigenes for
this transcript and another with a premature termination codon at
position 36 and found that translation from these transcripts was
reinitiated at codon 128.

PANCREATIC CANCER SUSCEPTIBILITY

Al-Sukhni et al. (2008) found loss of heterozygosity at the BRCA1 locus
in pancreatic tumor DNA from 5 (71%) of 7 patients with pancreatic
cancer (PNCA4; 614320) who carried a heterozygous germline BRCA1
mutation. Three patients carried the 185delAG mutation. In contrast,
only 1 (11%) of 9 patients with sporadic pancreatic cancer and no
germline BRCA1 mutations showed LOH at the BRCA1 locus. Al-Sukhni et al.
(2008) concluded that BRCA1 germline mutations likely predispose to the
development of pancreatic cancer, and suggested that individuals with
these mutations be considered for pancreatic cancer-screening programs.

BRCA1, 1-BP INS, 5382C

Simard et al. (1994) studied 30 Canadian families with breast and/or
ovarian cancer (604370) for germline mutations in the coding region of
the BRCA1 candidate gene. They identified a 1-bp (C) insertion at
position 5382 in exon 20, changing the reading frame of the mRNA and
causing a premature termination codon at position 1829 in exon 24. This
mutation was detected in the index case of 4 Canadian families. In 1 of
these families, 10 cases of cancer appeared in a single large sibship,
including 3 cases of breast cancer, 2 ovarian cancers, 2 leukemias, 2
pancreatic cancers, and 1 prostate cancer. A case of leukemia and a case
of Hodgkin disease were seen in more recent generations. In the 4
families with the 5382insC mutation, there were 14 cases of breast
cancer and 5 cases of ovarian cancer.

Gayther et al. (1997) found that the 5382insC and 4153delA (113705.0030)
mutations in the BRCA1 gene may account for 86% of cases of familial
ovarian cancer in Russia.

Gorski et al. (2000) found that 5382insC is a founder mutation in Polish
families with breast-ovarian cancer, accounting for 51% of identified
mutations. They studied 66 families in which at least 3 related females
were affected with breast or ovarian cancer and at least 1 of these 3
had been diagnosed with cancer before the age of 50. Mutations were
found in 35 (53%) of the 66 families; 18 of the families carried the
5382insC mutation. De Los Rios et al. (2001) reported findings in
Canadian families suggesting that most of the mutation-carrying families
of Polish ancestry have the BRCA1 5382insC mutation.

Al-Sukhni et al. (2008) found loss of heterozygosity at the BRCA1 locus
in pancreatic tumor DNA from 5 (71%) of 7 patients with pancreatic
cancer (PNCA4; 614320) who carried a heterozygous germline BRCA1
mutation. Three patients carried the 5382insC mutation. In contrast,
only 1 (11%) of 9 patients with sporadic pancreatic cancer and no
germline BRCA1 mutations showed LOH at the BRCA1 locus. Al-Sukhni et al.
(2008) concluded that BRCA1 germline mutations likely predispose to the
development of pancreatic cancer, and suggested that individuals with
these mutations be considered for pancreatic cancer-screening programs.

Porhanova et al. (2008) reported a 52-year-old Russian woman with
ovarian cancer who was found to be compound heterozygous for the 5382inC
mutation and a common Slavic mutation in the NBN gene (602667.0001).
Investigation of the ovarian cancer tissue showed somatic loss of
heterozygosity for NBN, but retention of heterozygosity for BRCA1. The
patient did not have a particularly severe cancer-prone phenotype, and
her parents did not have cancer, although 3 sibs developed cancer as
adults. Porhanova et al. (2008) commented that haploinsufficiency of the
BRCA1 gene may contribute to cancer progression without somatic changes.

Two BRCA1 founder mutations had been identified in the Norwegian
population: 1675delA (Dorum et al., 1997) and 1135insA (113705.0027)
(Andersen et al., 1996). Both result in a frameshift and a stop in exon
11. Dorum et al. (1999) ascertained 20 patients with breast-ovarian
cancer (604370) with the BRCA1 1675delA mutation and 10 with the
1135insA mutation. Their relatives were described with respect to
absence/presence of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Of 133 living female
relatives, 83 (62%) were tested for the presence of a mutation. No
difference in penetrance or expression between the 2 mutations was
found, whereas differences according to method of ascertainment were
seen. The overall findings were that disease started to occur at age 30
years and that by age 50 years 48% of the mutation-carrying women had
experienced breast and/or ovarian cancer. More ovarian cancers than
breast cancers were recorded. Both penetrance and expression (breast
cancer vs ovarian cancer) were different from those in reports of the
Ashkenazi founder mutations.

Individuals with an inherited mutation in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 (600185)

variants identified in these genes, there appeared to be no published
reports of de novo mutations. Tesoriero et al. (1999) identified a woman
who developed high-grade breast cancer with axillary nodal metastases
before the age of 40 years (604370). Her father developed prostate
cancer during his early fifties. Her mother had no cancer. The patient
was found to have a de novo 2-bp deletion (GA) at nucleotide 3888 in
exon 11 of the BRCA1 gene (3888delGA), and a 1-bp deletion (T) at
nucleotide 6174 in exon 11 of the BRCA2 gene (600185.0009), which had

Puget et al. (1999) described a 6-kb duplication of exon 13 that created
a frameshift in the coding sequence in 3 unrelated U.S. families of
European ancestry and in 1 Portuguese family with breast-ovarian cancer
(604370). To estimate the frequency and geographic diversity of carriers
of this duplication, the BRCA1 Exon 13 Duplication Screening Group
(2000) studied 3,580 unrelated individuals with a family history of
breast cancer and 934 early-onset breast and/or ovarian cancer cases
ascertained through 39 institutions in 19 countries. A total of 11
additional families carrying this mutation were identified in Australia
(1), Belgium (1), Canada (1), Great Britain (6), and the United States
(2). Haplotyping showed that they were likely to have derived from a
common ancestor, possibly of northern British origin. The screening
group suggested that BRCA1 screening protocols, either in
English-speaking countries or in countries with historic links with
Great Britain, should include the PCR-based assay described in their

Sarantaus et al. (2000) performed haplotype analysis of 26 Finnish

mutation in exon 11 of the BRCA1 gene. They estimated that the mutation
could be traced back 23 to 36 generations (500-700 years). The mutation
was observed in Swedish families also. Most of the Finnish families had
lived in Central Ostrobothnia for at least 300 years, whereas the
Swedish families came from the opposite side of the Gulf of Bothnia.
Thus, the mutation could have been brought across the sea from Sweden to
Finland with Swedish settlers.

BRCA1, 5-BP INS, NT3171

The 3171ins5 mutation in the BRCA1 gene is the most recurrent germline
BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation in Sweden (Johannsson et al., 1996). Bergman et al.
(2001) constructed haplotypes with polymorphic microsatellite markers
within and flanking the BRCA1 gene in 18 apparently unrelated families
with hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer (604370) with confirmed
3171ins5 mutation. All affected families originated from the same
geographic area along the west coast of Sweden. The microsatellite
markers spanned a region of 17.3 cM, and all of the analyzed families
shared a common 3.7 cM haplotype in the 3171ins5 carriers spanning over
4 markers located within or very close to the BRCA1 gene. This haplotype
was not present in any of the 116 control chromosomes, and the 3171ins5
mutation was likely to be identical by descent, i.e., a true founder.
The estimated age of the mutation was calculated to be approximately 50
generations, or a first appearance some time around the 6th century
(Bergman et al., 2001). No obvious correlation between the geographic
origin and genotype was observed. This is probably a reflection of how
the population of western Sweden historically has been a migrating
people along the west coast, with limited migration beyond this distinct
geographic area.

BRCA1, ARG71GLY

Vega et al. (2002) studied 30 Spanish breast and breast/ovarian cancer
(604370) families for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Mutations
were found in 8 of the 30 families (26.66%). All mutations were in the
BRCA1 gene. The 330A-G transition in the BRCA1 gene, which resulted in
an arg71-to-gly (R71G) substitution, was found in 4 unrelated families
and accounted for 50% of all identified mutations. It had been described
as a founder Spanish mutation, leading to aberrant splicing (Vega et
al., 2001). The proband in 1 family had bilateral breast cancer at 27
and 30 years of age. Her mother, who also had the mutation, was
diagnosed as having ovarian cancer at the age of 50.

Diez et al. (2003) stated that the 330A-G mutation affected the splice
donor site in intron 5; it caused aberrant splicing which resulted in a
deletion of 22 nucleotides in exon 5 and a stop at codon 64 (C64X). Diez
et al. (2003) observed this mutation in 7 families, most of them of
known Galician origin. As reported in the BRCA1 database, the 330A-G
mutation had been observed in families with probable Spanish origin in
diverse geographic locations in Europe other than Spain (France and the
United Kingdom), and in Caribbean and South American families.

BRCA1, MET1775ARG

In affected members of a family with breast-ovarian cancer (604370),
Miki et al. (1994) identified a heterozygous T-to-G transversion in exon
21 of the BRCA1 gene, resulting in a met1775-to-arg (M1775R)
substitution.

In the germline of patients with breast or ovarian cancer, Monteiro et
al. (1996) identified the M1775R mutation in the BRCA1 gene. This
mutation has impaired transcriptional activity on BRCA1. Williams and
Glover (2003) performed structural studies on the effect of this
mutation. The mutated side chain is extruded from the protein
hydrophobic core, thereby altering the protein surface. Charge-charge
repulsion, rearrangement of the hydrophobic core, and disruption of the
native hydrogen bonding network at the interface between the 2 BRCT
repeats contribute to the conformational instability of the mutant
protein. Williams and Glover (2003) concluded that destabilization and
global unfolding of the mutated BRCT domain at physiologic temperatures
explained the pleiotropic molecular and genetic defects associated with
the mutant protein.

Aglipay et al. (2006) showed that the M1775R mutation abrogated
interaction of BRCA1 with BRAT1 (614506), which is required for
activation of ATM (607585) following ionizing radiation-induced DNA
damage.

BRCA1, MET1775LYS

In 2 unrelated European families with a history of breast cancer
(604370), Tischkowitz et al. (2008) identified a met1775-to-lys (M1775K)
substitution in the BRCA1 gene and demonstrated its pathogenicity. The
authors showed that expression of the M1775K-mutant protein in yeast and
mammalian cells resulted in markedly reduced transcriptional activity of
BRCA1, indicating the pathogenicity of the variant. The M1775K mutation
disrupted the phosphopeptide-binding pocket of the BRCT domains, thereby
inhibiting BRCA1 interaction with the proteins BRIP1 (605882) and CTIP
(RBBP8; 604128), which are involved in DNA damage-induced checkpoint
control. These findings indicated that the BRCT phosphopeptide-binding
pocket is critical for the tumor suppression function of BRCA1.
Tischkowitz et al. (2008) used a combination of functional, structural,
molecular, and evolutionary methods in their study.

BRCA1, ARG1669GLU

In a Scandinavian family with breast-ovarian cancer (604370),
Vallon-Christersson et al. (2001) identified a G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 5215 in exon 18 of the BRCA1 gene, resulting in an
arg1669-to-glu (R1669Q) substitution. The R1669Q substitution lies
within alpha helix-2 of the C-terminal BRCT-N transactivation domain;
however, Vallon-Christersson et al. (2001) found that BRCA1 with this
substitution had wildtype transactivation activity.

Using mouse embryonic stem cells, Chang et al. (2011) found that
expression of human BRCA1 with the R1669Q substitution reduced embryonic
stem cell survival and caused upregulation of microRNA-155 (MIR155;
609337), which has a role in promoting cell growth and is upregulated in
various human cancers. Wildtype BRCA1, but not BRCA1 with the R1669Q
substitution, downregulated mouse Mir155 expression by recruiting Hdac2
(605164) to the Mir155 promoter, resulting in deacetylation of histones
H2a (see 142720) and H3 (see 601128).

602850	TITLE *602850 RING FINGER PROTEIN 4; RNF4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RNF4 is a SUMO (see 601912)-dependent ubiquitin E3 ligase. It has a role
in DNA demethylation and is required for efficient base excision repair
and maintenance of genome stability (summary by Hu et al., 2010).

CLONING

The RING finger motif is a specialized zinc finger domain found in many
transcriptional regulatory proteins. During analysis of 'self-positive'
clones isolated during a 2-hybrid screen, Chiariotti et al. (1998)
identified a novel mouse sequence containing a RING finger motif. The
corresponding full-length human cDNA encodes a 190-amino acid
polypeptide containing a canonical RING finger motif and 2 putative
nuclear localization signals. The observed size of the in
vitro-translated protein was 31 kD, in contrast with the predicted
molecular mass of 21.3 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a 3-kb mRNA
that was highly expressed in testis, with lower expression in all other
adult human tissues tested.

Hu et al. (2010) stated that RNF4 contains 4 N-terminal SUMO-interacting
motifs and a C-terminal RING finger motif critical for ubiquitination
activity.

GENE FUNCTION

In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; 612376), the RARA (180240) gene is
almost always fused with the PML gene (102578). APL can be treated
effectively with arsenic, which induces conjugation of the small protein
modifier SUMO (see SUMO2; 603042) to PML, leading to ubiquitination and
proteasomal degradation of PML and the PML-RARA fusion protein. Using
RNA interference, Tatham et al. (2008) demonstrated that RNF4 was
required for arsenic-induced degradation of PML. RNF4 ubiquitinated PML
only when PML was conjugated by SUMO2. In vitro binding studies showed
that rat Rnf4 predominantly bound poly-SUMO2, and this binding was
mediated by 4 conserved tandem SUMO-interaction motifs (SIMs) in the
N-terminal region of Rnf4. Knockdown of RNF4 in HeLa cells resulted in
the failure of arsenic to induce PML degradation and the accumulation of
SUMO-modified PML in the nucleus. Tatham et al. (2008) concluded that
RNF4 is a SUMO-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase.

Using mouse and human expression cDNA libraries to identify clones
encoding DNA demethylases, Hu et al. (2010) identified RNF4. RNF4
increased expression of several methylated test plasmids upon
transfection in human cell lines. Demethylation was independent of DNA
replication and cell proliferation. The endogenous base excision repair
enzymes TDG (601423) and APE1 (107748) interacted with RNF4 in HEK293
cells. Knockdown of either TDG or APE1 in HEK293 cells abrogated
RNF4-mediated demethylation of methylated test plasmids. Conversely,
RNF4 overexpression significantly increased enzymatic activities of both
TDG and APE1 and increased their G:T mismatch repair efficiency. Hu et
al. (2010) concluded that RNF4 may function as a scaffold to bring
together the base excision repair enzymes for efficient DNA repair.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chiariotti et al. (1998) determined that the RNF4 gene consists of 8
exons spanning approximately 47 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chiariotti et al. (1998) found that RNF4
is part of the well-characterized region of chromosome 4 near the HTT
gene (613004). The RNF4 gene was localized to chromosome 4p16.3,
approximately 500 kb telomeric of HTT.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hu et al. (2010) found that knockout of Rnf4 in mice was embryonic
lethal. Rnf4 -/- embryos were stunted, failed to develop, and showed
ventricular septal defects and cardiac insufficiency at death between
embryonic days 14 and 15. Examination of Rnf4 -/- embryonic fibroblasts
revealed global DNA hypermethylation and elevated DNA damage. Rnf4 +/-
animals showed no obvious phenotype.

DESCRIPTION

Wybutosine (yW) is a hypermodified guanosine at the 3-prime position
adjacent to the anticodon of phenylalanine tRNA that stabilizes
codon-anticodon interactions during decoding on the ribosome. TRMT12 is
the human homolog of a yeast gene essential for yW synthesis (Noma and
Suzuki, 2006).

CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of yeast Trm12, Kalhor et al. (2005)
identified human TRMT12.

600061	TITLE *600061 RAD23, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, A; RAD23A
;;HHR23A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Masutani et al. (1994) reported the purification to homogeneity and
subsequent cDNA cloning from HeLa cells of a repair complex by in vitro
complementation of the xeroderma pigmentosum group C (278720) defect in
a cell-free repair system containing UV-damaged SV40 minichromosomes.
The complex had a high affinity for ssDNA and consisted of 2 tightly
associated proteins of 125 and 58 kD. The 125-kD subunit represented the
previously reported XPC gene (613208) product, which represents the
human homolog of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) gene RAD4 of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The 58-kD species turned out to be a human
homolog of yeast RAD23. Unexpectedly, a second human counterpart of
RAD23 was identified. The 2 genes, which Masutani et al. (1994) referred
to as HHR23A (RAD23A) and HHR23B (RAD23B; 600062), were expressed in the
same cells. In the XPC purification scheme, however, only the RAD23B
protein was found in a complex with p125/XPC.

In the mouse, van der Spek et al. (1996) cloned the homologs of both
RAD23A and RAD23B. Detailed sequence comparisons permitted deductions
concerning the structure of all RAD23 homologs. Northern blot analysis
revealed constitutive expression of both RAD23 genes in all tissues
examined. Elevated RNA expression of both genes was observed in testis.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), van der Spek et al.
(1994) demonstrated that the RAD23A gene is located on 19p13.2.

By FISH, van der Spek et al. (1996) assigned the Rad23a gene to mouse
chromosome 8C3 and the Rad23b gene to mouse chromosome 4B3.

GENE FUNCTION

Masutani et al. (1994) commented that no human mutant defective in
RAD23A had been identified. They suggested that the nature of the defect
in xeroderma pigmentosum group C implies that the XPC-RAD23B complex
exerts a unique function in the genome-overall repair pathway that is
important for prevention of skin cancer.

Van der Spek et al. (1996) found that although the RAD23 equivalents are
well conserved during evolution, the mammalian genes do not express the
UV-inducible phenotype of their yeast counterpart. The authors stated
that this discovery may point to a fundamental difference between the UV
responses of yeast and human.

Machado-Joseph disease (MJD; 109150) is an autosomal dominant
neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine
tract near the C terminus of the MJD1 gene product, ataxin-3. The mutant
ataxin-3 forms intranuclear inclusions in cultured cells as well as in
diseased human brain and also causes cell death in transfected cells.
Using a 2-hybrid system, Wang et al. (2000) found that ataxin-3
interacts with 2 human homologs of the yeast DNA repair protein RAD23,
RAD23A and RAD23B. Both normal and mutant ataxin-3 proteins interact
with the ubiquitin-like domain at the N terminus of the RAD23 proteins,
which is a motif important for nucleotide excision repair. However, in
human embryonic kidney cells RAD23 is recruited to intranuclear
inclusions formed by the mutant ataxin-3 through its interaction with
ataxin-3. The authors suggested that this interaction may be associated
with the normal function of ataxin-3, and that some functional
abnormality of the RAD23 proteins may exist in MJD.

610850	TITLE *610850 XPA-BINDING PROTEIN 2; XAB2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a HeLa cDNA library with XPA (611153)
as bait, followed by RACE PCR, Nakatsu et al. (2000) cloned XAB2. The
855-amino acid protein has 3 acidic regions, 15 class I
tetratricopeptide repeats, and a conserved C-terminal region.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro pull-down assay, Nakatsu et al. (2000) confirmed the
specific interaction of XPA and XAB2 in yeast. Coimmunoprecipitation
assays showed that XAB2 also interacts with CSA (ERCC8; 609412), CSB
(ERCC6; 609413) and RNA polymerase II (see 180660) both in vitro and in
vivo. Microinjection of XAB2 antibodies in primary fibroblasts and
fibroblasts from XPC (278720) patients inhibited mRNA synthesis and
transcription-coupled repair (TCR), but did not affect global genome
repair (GGR), suggesting that XAB2 functions in normal transcription and
in TCR.

609117	TITLE *609117 F-BOX ONLY PROTEIN 46; FBXO46
;;FBX46
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXO46, are characterized
by an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by
SKP1 (601434), cullin (see CUL1; 603134), and F-box proteins, act as
protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the
F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other
protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004).

CLONING

By exon trapping and screening a brain cDNA library, Alwazzan et al.
(1998) cloned FBXO46, which they designated 20D7. The deduced protein
contains 202 amino acids. Northern blot analysis of 6 rat tissues
detected a 2.3-kb transcript only in testis.

Jin et al. (2004) reported that the FBXO46 protein contains a C-terminal
F box, followed by a CHORD (see 604353) zinc-binding domain.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Alwazzan et al. (1998) mapped the FBXO46
gene to chromosome 19, near the DMPK gene (605377). Jin et al. (2004)
stated that the FBXO46 gene maps to chromosome 19q13.3 and the mouse
Fbxo46 gene maps to chromosome 7A2.

;;OTF, LYMPHOID-SPECIFIC, 2; OTF2;;
OCTAMER-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2; OCT2
DESCRIPTION An understanding of development necessitates an understanding of the
molecular mechanisms of cell type-specific gene expression. Using
synthetic promoter constructions, it has been found that 2 sequences
within immunoglobulin promoters are sufficient for lymphoid-specific
promoter activity: an octamer, ATTTGCAT, and a TATA box. Staudt et al.
(1988) isolated a cDNA which hybridized with mRNA transcripts that were
largely restricted to lymphoid cells. The level of expression of the
gene, termed OCT2, within different lymphoid cell lines correlated well
with the amount of a nuclear factor called NFA2 that had previously been
detected only in lymphoid cells. Ko et al. (1988) determined the DNA
sequence of the OCT2 cDNA and showed that its gene product contains a
homeobox. Site-directed mutagenesis of the homeobox domain abolished DNA
binding. They demonstrated, furthermore, that the gene is located on
chromosome 19, using hybridization to a panel of somatic cell hybrid
DNAs. By linkage studies in an interspecific backcross and by studies of
recombinant inbred strains, Siracusa et al. (1991) assigned the Otf2
gene to mouse chromosome 7. Whereas the Otf1 and Otf2 molecular probes
recognize single loci, members of the Otf3 family map to mouse
chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 6, 14, 17, and the X chromosome.

Deans et al. (1996) identified the neuronal NOS gene (163731) as a
target of OCT2 transcriptional activation in neuronal cells.

Schubart et al. (2001) noted that Oct2-deficient mice die at birth but
have normal B-cell development and transcription of immunoglobulin (Ig)
genes. Oct-binding factor-1 (Obf1; 601206)-deficient mice are viable
with unaffected B-cell development in bone marrow and normal serum IgM
but have reduced B-cell numbers in spleen and low serum IgG. By creating
double knockout mice, Schubart et al. (2001) confirmed that B-cell
development and Ig gene transcription can proceed normally without these
B-cell specific factors. However, in these animals the mature B-cell
pool was strongly reduced, suggesting that these factors play an
important role in controlling the expansion and/or maintenance of mature
B cells.

601935	TITLE *601935 G PROTEIN PATHWAY SUPPRESSOR 2; GPS2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GPS2 is a physiologic coregulator of cholesterol homeostasis that
affects cholesterol to bile acid biosynthesis in liver and participates
in cholesterol transport and efflux in macrophages via activation of
ABCG1 (603076) (Sanyal et al., 2007; Jakobsson et al., 2009).

CLONING

Spain et al. (1996) used a yeast complementation system to identify
proteins involved in G protein-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
signaling cascades. They cloned the genes of 2 such proteins, GPS1
(601934) and GPS2. Sequence analysis revealed that the GPS2 gene encodes
a 327-amino acid polypeptide.

GENE FUNCTION

Spain et al. (1996) found that, when overexpressed in mammalian cells,
GPS1 or GPS2 could potently suppress a RAS (190020)- and MAPK-mediated
signal and interfere with JNK (601158) activity, suggesting that the
function of these genes may be signal repression.

Zhang et al. (2002) reported that GPS2, a protein involved in
intracellular signaling, is an integral subunit of the NCOR1
(600849)-HDAC3 (605166) complex. They determined structural motifs that
direct the formation of a highly stable and active deacetylase complex.
GPS2 and TBL1 (300196), another component of the NCOR1-HDAC3 complex,
interact cooperatively with repression domain-1 of NCOR1 to form a
heterotrimeric structure and are indirectly linked to HDAC3 via an
extended NCOR1 SANT domain that also activates latent HDAC3 activity.
Zhang et al. (2002) also showed that the NCOR1-HDAC3 complex inhibits
JNK activation through the associated GPS2 subunit and thus could
potentially provide an alternative mechanism for hormone-mediated
antagonism of AP1 (165160) function.

Sanyal et al. (2007) presented evidence that the NCOR1 subunit GPS2
regulates expression of CYP7A1 (118455) and CYP8B1 (602172), 2 major
enzymes involved in bile acid biosynthesis in liver.

Jakobsson et al. (2009) identified GPS2 as a coregulator required for
expression of the cholesterol transporter ABCG1 and the resultant
cholesterol efflux in human hepatic and macrophage cell lines and in
primary human hepatocytes. In macrophages, silencing of GPS2 by RNA
interference reduced ABCG1 expression and diminished ABCG1-mediated
cholesterol efflux. Upon activation of LXR (see NR1H3; 602423) by its
ligand, GPS2 facilitated LXR recruitment to an ABCG1 promoter/enhancer
unit, followed by histone H3 (see 602810) lys9 demethylation. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis and 2-hybrid and protein-protein
interactions assays revealed that GPS2 interacted with the LXR-RXR (see
RXRA; 180245) heterodimer at the LXR element of the ABCG1 promoter. GPS2
also appeared to stabilize the intrachromosomal association of the ABCG1
promoter with an enhancer element separated from the promoter region by
over 35 kb. In contrast with its role at the ABCG1 promoter, GPS2
behaved as a corepressor at the ABCA1 (600046) promoter. GPS2 occupied
the ABCA1 promoter in a corepressor complex in the absence of ligand and
was released from the ABCA1 promoter upon LXR activation.

147280	TITLE *147280 INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR II RECEPTOR; IGF2R
;;MANNOSE 6-PHOSPHATE RECEPTOR, CATION-INDEPENDENT; MPRI;;
CIMPR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IGF2R is a multifunctional receptor that possesses binding sites for
diverse ligands, including insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2; 147470),
retinoic acid, TGF-beta (TGFB1; 190180), urokinase-type plasminogen
activator receptor (UPAR, or PLAUR; 173391), and mannose-6-phosphate
(M6P), a modification characteristic of lysosomal enzymes. IGF2R plays
major roles in controlling IGF signaling by directing IGF2 to lysosomes,
in targeting lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes, and in recycling lysosomal
enzymes from the plasma membrane (summary by Killian and Jirtle, 1999).

CLONING

Oshima et al. (1988) cloned and sequenced the full-length cDNA for MPRI,
which encodes a protein of 2,491 amino acids. The amino acid sequence
includes a putative signal sequence of 40 amino acids, an
extracytoplasmic domain consisting of 15 homologous repeat sequences of
134 to 167 amino acids, a transmembrane region of 23 amino acids, and a
cytoplasmic domain of 164 amino acids. The predicted molecular mass was
greater than 270 kD. On comparison to the reported structure of IGF2R
(Morgan et al., 1987), MPRI was found to show 99.8% identity at the
nucleotide level and 99.4% identity at the amino acid level. By cDNA
sequencing, Laureys et al. (1988) showed that the cation-independent
mannose 6-phosphate receptor and IGF2 receptor are identical.

Szebeny and Rotwein (1994) cloned and characterized the mouse Igf2r
gene. It encodes a predicted protein of 2,482 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Insulin-like growth factor II (147470) is a polypeptide hormone with
structural homologies to insulin (INS; 176730) and IGF I (IGF1; 147440).
Although IGF II can stimulate a broad range of biologic responses in
isolated cells, these responses appear to be mediated by the insulin and
IGF I receptors (147670 and 147370, respectively). The receptor for IGF
II was found to be the receptor for mannose 6-phosphate, which is
implicated in targeting of lysosomal enzymes (MacDonald et al., 1988;
Roth, 1988; Tong et al., 1988). Purified human and rat IGF2 receptors
interact with antibodies to the mannose 6-phosphate receptor and with
mannose 6-phosphate.

Waheed et al. (1988) showed that the M6P and IGF2 binding sites are
located on different segments of the receptor.

Kiess et al. (1988) presented biochemical evidence that the IGF2
receptor and the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor are the
same protein, but that the binding sites for the 2 ligands are distinct.
In its guise as a mannose 6-phosphate receptor, the IGF2 receptor binds
mannose 6-phosphate residues on lysosomal enzymes and transports them
into lysosomes (Kornfeld and Mellman, 1989).

The serine proteinase granzyme B (GZMB; 123910) is crucial for the rapid
induction of target cell apoptosis by cytotoxic T cells. GZMB enters
cells in a perforin-independent manner, predicting the existence of a
cell surface receptor(s). Motyka et al. (2000) presented evidence that
this receptor is IGF2R. Inhibition of the GZMB-IGF2R interaction
prevented GZMB cell surface binding, uptake, and the induction of
apoptosis. Significantly, expression of IGF2R was essential for
cytotoxic T cell-mediated apoptosis of target cells in vitro and for the
rejection of allogeneic cells in vivo.

The cytosolic tails of both the cation-independent and the
cation-dependent (154540) mannose 6-phosphate receptors contain acidic
cluster-dileucine signals that direct sorting from the trans-Golgi
network to the endosomal-lysosomal system. Puertollano et al. (2001)
found that these signals bind to the VHS domain of the Golgi-localized,
gamma-ear-containing, ARF-binding proteins (GGA1, 606004; GGA2, 606005;
GGA3, 606006). The receptors and the GGAs left the trans-Golgi network
on the same tubulovesicular carriers. A dominant-negative GGA mutant
blocked exit of the receptors from the trans-Golgi network. Puertollano
et al. (2001) concluded that the GGAs appear to mediate sorting of the
mannose 6-phosphate receptors to the trans-Golgi network.

Zhu et al. (2001) found that the VHS domain of GGA2 binds the acidic
cluster-dileucine motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the
cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor. Receptors with
mutations in this motif were defective in lysosomal enzyme sorting. The
hinge domain of GGA2 bound clathrin, suggesting that GGA2 could be a
link between cargo molecules and clathrin-coated vesicle assembly. Thus,
Zhu et al. (2001) concluded that GGA2 binding to the cation-independent
mannose 6-phosphate receptor is important for lysosomal enzyme
targeting.

- Imprinting of IGF2R

Mouse embryos produce transcripts of the Igf2r gene from the maternal
chromosome but not from the paternal. This could explain why mice that
are heterozygous for deletions of the locus develop normally if their
paternal allele is missing but die during early development if the
maternal allele is missing. Studies in transgenic mice (Barlow et al.,
1991) showed parental imprinting, i.e., monoallelic expression, of the
Igf2r gene. It is probably no coincidence that the Igf2 gene and the
Igf2r gene are oppositely imprinted in mouse (DeChiara et al., 1991).
Haig and Graham (1991) proposed that the oppositely imprinted genes
function to control the ultimately adverse effects of excessive
production of Igf2 from the maternal allele. The suggestion is based on
the model of Haig and Westoby (1989), which proposed that the evolution
of genomic imprinting is expected in organisms that have both a breeding
system in which females carry offspring by more than one male during
their life span and a system of parental care in which offspring receive
most of their postfertilization nutrients from 1 parent (usually the
mother) and thus compete with offspring fathered by other males.
Strictly, imprinting is possible whenever an individual's interactions
are asymmetric with respect to maternal- and paternal-side relatives.

Using allele-specific primers and parallel amplification of maternal and
fetal DNA, Kalscheuer et al. (1993) determined that both maternal and
paternal IGF2R alleles were expressed in all human fetal tissues
examined and at all developmental stages examined. They concluded that
the IGF2R gene escapes imprinting in humans.

Xu et al. (1993) found that both parental IGF2R alleles were expressed
in 4 term placentae and in placenta and lung from 7 of 10 fetuses. Of
the remaining 3 fetuses, 2 expressed only the maternal copy, and the
third showed partial repression of the paternal allele. In adult blood
cell samples, 13 of 14 heterozygotes expressed both alleles, and 1
showed partial repression of 1 allele. Xu et al. (1993) concluded that
imprinting at the IGF2R locus is a polymorphic trait in humans.

Although in mice the Igf2r gene is maternally imprinted (Barlow et al.,
1991), in humans imprinting appears to be a polymorphic trait (Xu et
al., 1993; Kalscheuer et al., 1993; Ogawa et al., 1993). Thus, mice and
any humans who are imprinted may have an increased susceptibility to
hepatocellular carcinoma, since only 1 mutation would be required to
render the gene inactive. De Souza et al. (1995) noted that, since the
IGF2R protein is normally present in circulation, mutant receptors in
plasma might be helpful in liver tumor detection. Furthermore, they
stated that mutated receptors on the plasma membrane of liver tumor
cells might provide a surface antigen for the targeting of both
therapeutic and diagnostic agents to liver tumors.

Smrzka et al. (1995) found that the intronic CpG island of human IGF2R
was methylated in 11 individuals. Analysis in 1 informative family
showed that the methylation was specific to the maternal allele, similar
to observations in the mouse Igf2r gene. However, unlike the monoallelic
expression observed in mouse, only 1 of 70 lymphoblastoid cell lines
showed monoallelic IGF2R expression. Smrzka et al. (1995) concluded that
the intronic CpG islands of both mouse and human IGF2R are methylated
following maternal, but not paternal, transmittance, but this
methylation mark does not correlate with allele-specific expression.

By examining the methylation status of genomic DNA from human blood,
liver, and placenta, Riesewijk et al. (1996) found that, like mouse
Igf2r, the intronic CpG island of human IGF2R was hypermethylated on the
maternal allele. However, unlike mouse Igf2r, the upstream CpG island of
human IGF2R was completely unmethylated on both parental chromosomes.

Livestock cloning and in vitro embryo culture have been adversely
affected by the exceptional size of some resulting lambs and calves.
Multiple abnormalities associated with 'large offspring syndrome' (LOS)
limit application of these technologies. Similar fetal overgrowth in
humans and mice can result from altered expression of several imprinted
genes that are expressed only from 1 parental allele, including IGF2R.
Cloning or nonphysiologic embryo culture environments may result in
inappropriate epigenetic modification of imprinted genes during early
embryogenesis, when many allele-specific imprints are established or
maintained. Young et al. (2001) demonstrated reduced fetal methylation
and expression of sheep Igf2r, suggesting that preimplantation embryo
procedures may be vulnerable to epigenetic alterations in imprinted
genes. This highlighted the potential benefits of epigenetic diagnostic
screening in developing embryo procedures.

In mouse, a bidirectional silencer for a 400-kb region that contains 3
imprinted, maternally expressed protein-coding genes (IGF2R; SLC22A2,
602608; SLC22A3, 604842) has been shown by targeted deletion to be
located in a sequence of 3.7 kb, which also contains the promoter for
the imprinted, paternally expressed noncoding RNA Air (AIRN; 604893).
Expression of Air is correlated with repression of all 3 genes on the
paternal allele; however, Air RNA overlaps just 1 of these genes in an
antisense orientation. By inserting a polyadenylation signal that
truncated 96% of the RNA transcript, Sleutels et al. (2002) demonstrated
that Air RNA is required for silencing. The truncated Air allele
maintained imprinted expression and methylation of the Air promoter, but
showed complete loss of silencing of the Igf2r/Slc22a2/Slc22a3 gene
cluster on the paternal chromosome. Sleutels et al. (2002) concluded
that noncoding RNAs have an active role in genomic imprinting.

Both the mouse and human IGF2R genes contain differentially methylated
regions (DMRs) in the upstream promoter region (DMR1) and within intron
2 (DMR2), which includes the promoter for the antisense transcript, AIR.
Imprinting of mouse Igf2r depends on DMR2 and the presence of Air.
However, biallelic expression of Igf2r in mouse brain occurs despite the
presence of Air, and biallelic expression of human IGF2R in peripheral
tissues occurs despite the presence of DMR2. Vu et al. (2004) examined
histone modifications throughout mouse and human IGF2R using chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays and quantitative real-time PCR. Methylation
of lys4 and lys9 of histone H3 in the promoter regions marked the active
and silenced alleles, respectively. While both di- and trimethyl lys4
marked the active Igf2r and the active Air allele in mouse, trimethyl
lys9 but not dimethyl lys9 marked the suppressed Air allele. Enrichment
of parental allele-specific histone modifications in the promoter
region, rather than the presence of DNA methylation or antisense
transcription, correctly identified the tissue- and species-specific
imprinting status of IGF2R. Biallelic expression of human IGF2R in fetal
skin cells appeared to be controlled by histone modification at DMR1
only and was independent of methylation at DMR2. No AIR expression was
detected in human.

In murine glial cells and fibroblasts, Yamasaki et al. (2005) found that
Igf2r was maternally expressed and that Air was paternally expressed. In
murine primary cultured neurons, Igf2r was biallelically expressed, and
Air was not expressed. In DMR2, which includes the Air promoter,
allele-specific DNA methylation, differential H3 and H4 acetylation, and
H3K4 and K9 dimethylation were maintained in each cultured cell type. In
DMR1, which includes the Igf2r promoter, maternal allele-specific DNA
hypomethylation, histones H3 and H4 acetylation, and H3K4 dimethylation
were apparent in glial cells and fibroblasts. However, in neurons,
biallelic DNA hypomethylation and biallelic histones H3 and H4
acetylation and H3K4 dimethylation were detected. Yamasaki et al. (2005)
concluded that lack of reciprocal imprinting of Igf2r and Air in the
brain may result from neuron-specific relaxation of Igf2r imprinting
associated with neuron-specific histone modifications in DMR1 and lack
of Air expression.

Mammalian imprinted genes often cluster with long noncoding (lnc) RNAs.
Three lncRNAs that induce parental-specific silencing show hallmarks
indicating that their transcription is more important than their
product. To test whether Airn (AIRN; 604893) transcription or product
silences the Igf2r gene, Latos et al. (2012) shortened the endogenous
lncRNA to different lengths. The results excluded a role for spliced and
unspliced Airn IncRNA products and for Airn nuclear size and location in
silencing Igf2r. Instead, silencing required only Airn transcriptional
overlap of the Igf2r promoter, which interferes with RNA polymerase II
recruitment in the absence of repressive chromatin. Such a repressor
function for lncRNA transcriptional overlap reveals a gene silencing
mechanism that may be widespread in the mammalian genome, given the
abundance of lncRNA transcripts.

GENE STRUCTURE

Killian and Jirtle (1999) determined that the IGF2R gene contains 48
exons and spans about 136 kb.

Smrzka et al. (1995) determined that the promoter regions of the mouse
and human IGF2R genes are located within CpG islands that lack TATA or
CAAT boxes. Several regulatory elements are conserved in mouse and
human, including 3 E boxes and several GC boxes. Intron 2 of the IGF2R
gene contains a second CpG island in both mouse and human.

MAPPING

Laureys et al. (1988) mapped the human IGF2R gene to chromosome 6q25-q27
using cloned cDNAs to probe Southern blots of somatic cell hybrid DNA
and for in situ chromosomal hybridization. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Rao et al. (1994) narrowed the assignment of the IGF2R
gene to chromosome 6q26.

Acquati et al. (1994) described a 2-Mb YAC from the telomeric region of
chromosome 6q containing the plasminogen-apolipoprotein(a) gene family
at its centromeric end and the IGF2R gene at the telomeric end. About
350 kb separated IGF2R from the nearest member of the PLG/LPA cluster of
genes. Barlow et al. (1991) mapped the mouse Igf2r gene to the
T-associated maternal effect locus (Tme) on chromosome 17.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Placental development and genomic imprinting coevolved with parental
conflict over resource distribution to mammalian offspring. The
imprinted genes IGF2 and IGF2R code for the growth promoter insulin-like
growth factor-2 (IGF2) and its inhibitor, mannose 6-phosphate (M6P)/IGF2
receptor (IGF2R), respectively. M6P/IGF2R of birds and fish do not
recognize IGF2. In monotremes, which lack imprinting, IGF2 specifically
bound M6P/IGF2R via a hydrophobic CD loop. Williams et al. (2012) showed
that the DNA coding the CD loop in monotremes functions as an exon
splice enhancer (ESE) and that structural evolution of binding site
loops (AB, HI, FG) improved therian IGF2 affinity. Williams et al.
(2012) proposed that ESE evolution led to the fortuitous acquisition of
IGF2 binding by M6P/IGF2R that drew IGF2R into parental conflict;
subsequent imprinting may then have accelerated affinity maturation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor functions
in the intracellular trafficking of lysosomal enzymes, the activation of
the potent growth inhibitor, transforming growth factor beta, and the
degradation of IGF2, a mitogen often overproduced in tumors. De Souza et
al. (1995) demonstrated that 70% of human hepatocellular tumors have
loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the M6P/IGF2R locus at 6q26. In a
separate report, De Souza et al. (1995) described a mutation screen that
identified point mutations in the remaining allele of 25% of human
hepatocellular carcinomas with LOH. One mutation created an alternative
splice site within an intron (corresponding to intron 40 in mouse) and
resulted in a truncated receptor; 2 others (147280.0001, 147280.0002)
gave rise to significant amino acid substitutions. These mutations
provided evidence to the authors that the M6P/IGF2R gene functions as a
tumor suppressor in human liver carcinogenesis.

Souza et al. (1996) reported that the IGF2R gene contains a number of
microsatellite repeats within its coding sequence. They demonstrated
microsatellite instability in this gene in 12 of 92 gastrointestinal
tumors studied which were replication/repair error-positive. Mutations
occurred in 6 of the poorly differentiated tumors. They noted an
anticorrespondence of IGF2R and TGFBR2 (190182) mutations. Of 31
gastrointestinal lesions studied with IGF2R or TGFBR2 mutations, 90%
(28) contained mutations in one or the other, but not both, of these
genes. Souza et al. (1996) demonstrated that all but 1 of the mutations
occurred within an 8-polydeoxyguanine tract spanning nucleotides
4089-4096 of the IGF2R coding sequence. In 1 case of gastric
adenocarcinoma, mutation occurred in a polyCT tract spanning nucleotides
6169-6180. These mutations all comprised 1- or 2-bp deletions or
insertions within the microsatellite region, causing frameshifts and
premature stop codons downstream. Souza et al. (1996) noted that the
TGFBR2 gene is also subject to microsatellite instability within its
coding region. They noted further that IGF2R and TGFBR2 genes comprise
serial points in the same tumorigenesis pathway, since mutation of
either gene alone occurred in 90% of the gastrointestinal tumors that
they analyzed.

To facilitate genetic analyses of the imprint status of human M6P/IGF2R
and loss of heterozygosity at this locus in cancer, Killian et al.
(2001) screened American and Japanese populations for M6P/IGF2R single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). They identified 9 novel intragenic SNPs
and 3 amino acid variants in the ligand-binding domains of M6P/IGF2R
that may be under selection in humans.

Sandovici et al. (2003) examined allelic methylation ratios at
differentially methylated regions (DMRs) within the IGF2/H19 (103280)
and IGF2R loci in a panel of 48 3-generation families. There was
familial clustering of individuals with abnormal methylation ratios at
the IGF2/H19 DMR, as well as stability of this trait over a period of
nearly 2 decades, consistent with the possibility that constitutional
loss of imprinting (LOI) at this locus may be due largely to genetic
factors. At the IGF2R DMR, more variability in the allelic methylation
ratios was observed over time, but there was also familial clustering of
abnormal methylation ratios. Sandovici et al. (2003) concluded that
shared genetic factors may be responsible for a major fraction of
interindividual variability in parental origin-dependent epigenetic
modifications; however, temporal changes also occur in isolated cases,
as well as within multiple individuals in the same family, indicating
that environmental factors may also play a role.

ANIMAL MODEL

To determine whether paternal expression of the Igf2r gene is necessary
for early development in the mouse, Lau et al. (1994) derived mice in
which the gene had been disrupted by targeted mutagenesis in embryonic
stem (ES) cells with the subsequent introduction of the mutation into
the germline of mice. Lau et al. (1994) found that murine embryos that
inherit a nonfunctional Igf2r gene from their father are viable and
develop normally into adults; however, most mice inheriting the same
mutated allele from their mothers die around the time of birth as a
consequence of major cardiac abnormalities. The mice that inherit the
mutant allele from their mothers do not express Igf2r in their tissues,
are 25 to 30% larger than their normal sibs, have elevated levels of
circulating IGF2 and IGF-binding proteins, and exhibit a slight kink in
the tail. The findings of overgrowth may support the suggestion that
relaxation of maternal imprinting of IGF2 plays a role in the features
of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (130650) (Feinberg, 1993).

IGF2R, GLY1449VAL

De Souza et al. (1995) found a C-to-A transversion in 1 allele of the
IGF2R gene creating a gly1449-to-val amino acid substitution in the gene
product. This mutation was found in a tumor which showed deletion of the
other allele as judged by loss of heterozygosity (LOH).

De Souza et al. (1995) found a G-to-A transition in 1 allele of the

product. This mutation was found in a tumor which showed deletion of the
other allele as judged by loss of heterozygosity (LOH).

606796	TITLE *606796 SUPPRESSION OF TUMORIGENICITY 13; ST13
;;P48;;
HSC70-INTERACTING PROTEIN; HIP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ST13 is an abundant, highly conserved protein that binds the major
cytosolic chaperones heat-shock protein 70-kD (HSP70; see 140550) and
HSP90 (see 140571) during an intermediate stage of steroid receptor
assembly, but is absent from the mature receptor complex.

CLONING

Prapapanich et al. (1996) isolated a 48-kD protein that transiently
associates with progesterone receptor (607311) during cell-free assembly
in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Using an antibody developed against the
purified protein, Prapapanich et al. (1996) cloned ST13 cDNA from a HeLa
cell cDNA library. The deduced 369-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of approximately 41 kD and an apparent molecular mass of
48 kD by SDS-PAGE. By Northern blot analysis, Prapapanich et al. (1996)
identified 4 ST13 mRNAs, ranging in size from about 1.3 kb to 3.2 kb,
with expression in all tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Hohfeld et al. (1995) showed that rat Hip
bound Hsc70 (HSPA8; 600816). One Hip oligomer bound the ATPase domains
of at least 2 Hsc70 molecules, and binding was dependent on activation
of the Hsc70 ATPase by Hsp40 (DNAJB1; 604572). Hip stabilized the
ADP-bound form of Hsc70, which had a high affinity for a test protein
substrate. Hohfeld et al. (1995) concluded that HIP contributes to
interactions of HSC70 with target proteins through its own chaperone
activity.

Prapapanich et al. (1996) coimmunoprecipitated progesterone receptor
assembly complexes with in vitro translated ST13. By Western blot
analysis, they identified HSP70 and HSP90 in these complexes.

Using subtractive hybridization between cDNA of normal mucosal tissues
and mRNA of colorectal carcinoma tissues, Cao et al. (1997) found
downregulated expression of ST13 in the cancer tissues.

Using a yeast expression system, Nelson et al. (2004) found that human
HIP enhanced hormone-dependent activation of a reporter gene by rat
glucocorticoid receptor (GCCR; 138040). HIP promoted functional
maturation of Gccr by enhancing formation of its ligand-binding domain.
HIP did not affect the steady-state levels of Gccr protein, and its
activity did not require yeast Hsp70 proteins. N-terminal truncation of
HIP reduced its ability to enhance Gccr signaling, likely due to loss of
HIP homooligomerization. HOP (STIP1; 605063) also appeared to have an
HSP70-independent role in GCCR maturation.

Polyglutamine disorders, such as spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy
(SBMA, or SMAX1; 313200) and Huntington disease (143100), are caused by
an expansion in the glutamine trinucleotide (CAG) repeat in the affected
genes, resulting in mutant proteins that aggregate into insoluble
inclusions within affected neurons. Howarth et al. (2009) showed that
overexpression of human HIP significantly reduced inclusion formation in
an in vitro mouse model of SBMA and in a rat primary neuronal model of
polyglutamine disease. The activity of denatured luciferase, a measure
of protein refolding, was not increased in the presence of HIP alone,
but it was increased when HIP was coexpressed with HSP70 or HSC70.
Howarth et al. (2009) concluded that HIP may prevent inclusion formation
by facilitating the constitutive HSC70 refolding cycle and possibly by
preventing aggregation.

MAPPING

Zhang et al. (1998) mapped the ST13 gene to chromosome 22q13 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. They noted that colorectal, breast,
and ovarian carcinomas frequently show loss of heterozygosity at this
site.

;;GENE BESIDE THE MA29 DELETION; B29;;
C18ORF3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing a region of chromosome 18 that contains a segment deleted
in the Ma29 lung cancer cell line, followed by screening a brain cDNA
library, Yanaihara et al. (2001) cloned B29. B29 is located outside the
Ma29 deletion. The deduced B29 protein contains 248 amino acids.
Yanaihara et al. (2001) also identified 3 minor isoforms that differ in
the reading frame utilized and in the presence or absence of exon 3
and/or exon 6. Expression levels were below the limit of detection for
Northern blot analysis, but RT-PCR found near ubiquitous expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yanaihara et al. (2001) determined that the B29 gene contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Yanaihara et al. (2001) mapped the B29
gene to chromosome 18q21.

176941	TITLE *176941 TYROSINE KINASE 2; TYK2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To identify novel protein tyrosine kinase genes expressed in human
lymphoid cells, Krolewski et al. (1990) screened B- and T-cell cDNA
libraries at low stringency using an FMS (164770) tyrosine kinase domain
probe. One of 3 genes so identified, TYK2, could not clearly be assigned
to any of the known tyrosine kinase subfamilies and therefore may be the
prototype of a novel subfamily.

Using a fragment of the clone isolated by Krolewski et al. (1990) to
screen a T-cell lymphoma cell line cDNA library, Firmbach-Kraft et al.
(1990) obtained a full-length TYK2 cDNA. The deduced 1,187-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 134 kD. TYK2 contains a
C-terminal protein tyrosine kinase catalytic domain with a consensus
ATP-binding site. It has no N-terminal signal peptide or transmembrane
domain, suggesting that TYK2 is not a receptor-type protein tyrosine
kinase. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb transcript in all human
cell lines examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Firmbach-Kraft et al. (1990) found that TYK2 expression increased 5-fold
in a promyelocytic cell line following retinoic acid-induced
differentiation. They found a slight increase in TYK2 expression
following phorbol ester-induced differentiation of a myeloid cell line.

Lukashova et al. (2001) found that platelet-activating factor (PAF)
induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of TYK2 in 2 human monocytic cell
lines and in COS-7 cells transfected with PAF receptor (PTAFR; 173393)
and TYK2 cDNAs. TYK2 coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized with PTAFR
independent of ligand binding. Deletion mutation analysis indicated that
the N terminus of TYK2 bound PTAFR. Activation of TYK2 was followed by a
time-dependent 2- to 4-fold increase in the level of tyrosine
phosphorylation of STAT1 (600555), STAT2 (600556), and STAT3 (102582),
and a sustained 2.5-fold increase in STAT5 (see 601511) tyrosine
phosphorylation. STAT1 and STAT3 translocated to the nucleus following
PAF stimulation, and their translocation was dependent on TYK2 in
transiently-transfected COS-7 cells. In the presence of TYK2, PAF
induced activation of PTAFR promoter-1 in a reporter assay. TYK2
activation and signaling by PAF was independent of G proteins.

In human coronary artery vascular smooth muscle cells, UPA (PLAU;
191840) stimulates cell migration via a UPA receptor (UPAR, or PLAUR;
173391) signaling complex containing TYK2 and phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K; see 601232). Kiian et al. (2003) showed that association
of TYK2 and PI3K with active GTP-bound forms of both RHOA (ARHA; 165390)
and RAC1 (602048), but not CDC42 (116952), as well as phosphorylation of
myosin light chain (see 160781), are downstream events required for
UPA/UPAR-directed migration.

In the type I interferon receptor, TYK2 associates with the IFNAR1
(107450) receptor subunit and positively influences ligand binding to
the receptor complex. Ragimbeau et al. (2003) found that TYK2 was
required for stable cell surface expression of IFNAR1 in human
fibrosarcoma cells. In the absence of TYK2, IFNAR1 was exported to the
plasma membrane but then accumulated in endocytic organelles. TYK2
coexpression prevented intracellular accumulation of IFNAR1 by
restraining its constitutive internalization, and thus stabilized it at
the cell surface.

Minegishi et al. (2006) found that IFNA (147660) stimulation of cells
from a patient with TYK2 deficiency (611521) failed to induce tyrosine
phosphorylation of JAK1 (147795), STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, and STAT4
(600558). Likewise, IL23 (605580) stimulation failed to result in
phosphorylation of STAT4. IL6 (147620) and IL10 (124092) stimulation
failed to upregulate SOCS3 (604176). Impaired Th1 differentiation and
accelerated Th2 differentiation in the patient's T cells suggested that
TYK2 is critical for IL12 (see 161561)-induced Th1 differentiation and
represses development of Th2 helper cells. Introduction of wildtype TYK2
into the patient's T cells rescued the IL12 and IFNA signaling defects.
Minegishi et al. (2006) concluded that TYK2 plays an indispensable role
in controlling responses to multiple cytokines in humans, a substantial
difference from Tyk2 function in mice (see ANIMAL MODEL).

MAPPING

Krolewski et al. (1990) assigned the TYK2 gene to human chromosome 19 by
Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNAs. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Firmbach-Kraft et al. (1990) and Trask et al. (1993)
assigned the TYK2 gene to 19p13.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700) is a complex systemic
autoimmune disease caused by both genetic and environmental factors.
Increased production of type I interferon (IFN) and expression of
IFN-inducible genes are commonly observed in SLE and may be pivotal in
the molecular pathogenesis of the disorder. Sigurdsson et al. (2005)
analyzed 44 SNPs in 13 genes from the type I IFN pathway of 679 Swedish,
Finnish, and Icelandic patients with SLE, 798 unaffected family members,
and 438 unrelated control individuals for joint linkage and association
with SLE. In 2 of the genes, TYK2 and IFN regulatory factor-5 (IRF5;
607218), they identified SNPs that displayed strong signals in joint
analysis of linkage and association with SLE. TYK2 binds to the type I
IFN receptor complex, and IRF5 is a regulator of type I IFN gene
expression. The results of Sigurdsson et al. (2005) support a disease
mechanism in SLE that involves key components of the type I interferon
system.

In a 22-year-old Japanese male with characteristic features of both
autosomal recessive hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES; 243700) and atypical
mycobacteriosis (209950), Minegishi et al. (2006) identified a
homozygous deletion of GCTT at nucleotide 550 in the TYK2 gene
(176941.0001), resulting in a frameshift and premature termination of
the protein at amino acid 90. Immunoblot analysis detected no TYK2
protein in the patient's T cells. Both of the patient's parents, who
were healthy, were heterozygous for the TYK2 mutation. Introduction of
wildtype TYK2 into the patient's T cells rescued their cytokine
signaling defects. Minegishi et al. (2006) concluded that TYK2
deficiency (611521) is a primary immunodeficiency displaying the
phenotype of the autosomal recessive HIES accompanied by susceptibility
to intracellular bacterial infection.

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the TYK2
gene and multiple sclerosis, see MS (126200).

ANIMAL MODEL

Karaghiosoff et al. (2000) generated Tyk2 -/- mice. In contrast to other
Janus kinase family members, where inactivation leads to complete loss
of the respective cytokine receptor signal, Tyk2 -/- mice showed reduced
responses to Ifna/Ifnb (147640) and Il12 and selective deficiency in
Stat3 activation in these pathways. Ifng (147570) signaling was also
impaired, and Tyk2 -/- macrophages failed to produce nitric oxide upon
lipopolysaccharide induction. Tyk2 -/- mice failed to clear vaccinia
virus infection and showed a reduced T-cell response to lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus infection. Karaghiosoff et al. (2000) concluded
that Tyk2 contributes selectively to signals triggered by various
biologic stimuli and cytokine receptors.

Stoiber et al. (2004) demonstrated that mice deficient in Tyk2 developed
Abelson murine leukemia virus (see 189980)-induced B lymphoid
leukemia/lymphoma as well as Tel (600618)/Jak2 (147796)-induced
T-lymphoid leukemia with a higher incidence and shortened latency
compared to wildtype controls. The high susceptibility of Tyk2 -/- mice
resulted from impaired tumor surveillance, and Tyk2 -/- Abelson-induced
lymphomas were easily rejected after transplantation into wildtype
hosts. There was decreased in vitro cytotoxic capacity of Tyk2 -/-
natural killer (NK) and NK T cells toward tumor-derived cells. Stoiber
et al. (2004) concluded that TYK2 is an important regulator of lymphoid
tumor surveillance.

PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 4-KINASE, TYPE III, ALPHA;;
PI4KIII-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-kinase catalyzes the first committed step in
the biosynthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Several forms
of mammalian PI 4-kinases have been purified, characterized, and
classified into types II and III. The type II enzymes have an apparent
molecular mass of approximately 55 kD, are highly stimulated by
detergent, and are inhibited by adenosine. The type III enzymes have an
apparent molecular mass of greater than 200 kD, are less stimulated by
detergent, and are not inhibited by adenosine (summary by Nakagawa et
al., 1996).

CLONING

By PCR and by screening human placenta and fetal brain cDNA libraries,
Wong and Cantley (1994) cloned cDNAs encoding a PI 4-kinase, which they
named PI4K-alpha. The predicted 854-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 97 kD. It contains an ankyrin repeat, a lipid kinase
unique domain, a pleckstrin-homology domain, and a lipid kinase
catalytic domain. PI4K-alpha has high amino acid sequence similarity to
the yeast PI 4-kinases STT4 and PIK1; it has less amino acid sequence
similarity to the catalytic domains of mammalian and yeast PI 3-kinases
(e.g., 171834) and to the yeast TOR family of proteins. The enzymatic
properties of PI4K-alpha were characteristic of type II PI 4-kinases. By
Northern blot analysis, 7.5- and 3.5-kb PI4K-alpha transcripts were
detected in all human tissues examined, with the highest levels in
placenta and brain.

Nakagawa et al. (1996) cloned a PI 4-kinase cDNA from a rat brain cDNA
library. The C-terminal amino acid sequence of the predicted 2,041-amino
acid rat PI 4-kinase is 98% similar to the amino acid sequence of
PI4K-alpha, the human PI 4-kinase cDNA described by Wong and Cantley
(1994). Northern blot analysis of adult rat tissues detected a 7.8-kb
transcript in all tissues examined, except liver. Based on their similar
amino acid sequences and mRNA expression patterns, Nakagawa et al.
(1996) suggested that PI4K-alpha and the rat PI 4-kinase represent
alternatively spliced forms of the same molecule. The N-terminal region
of the rat PI 4-kinase, which is absent in PI4K-alpha, contains 2
proline-rich regions and an SH3 domain. Western blot analysis of lysates
from transfected mammalian cells indicated that the rat PI 4-kinase has
a molecular mass of approximately 230 kD. Nakagawa et al. (1996) found
that the rat PI 4-kinase has the enzymatic properties of type III PI
4-kinases. By in situ hybridization, they detected rat PI 4-kinase mRNA
in the gray matter of the brain, with expression higher in fetal brain
than in adult brain. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the protein
is associated with the membranes of Golgi vesicles and vacuoles.

GENE FUNCTION

Hammond et al. (2012) used a combination of pharmacologic and chemical
genetic approaches to probe the function of plasma membrane
phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), most of which was not required
for the synthesis or functions of PI(4,5)P2. However, depletion of both
lipids was required to prevent plasma membrane targeting of proteins
that interact with acidic lipids or activation of the transient receptor
potential vanilloid-1 cation channel. Therefore, PI4P contributes to the
pool of polyanionic lipids that define plasma membrane identity and to
some functions previously attributed specifically to PI(4,5)P2, which
may be fulfilled by a more general polyanionic lipid requirement.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PI4KA
gene to chromosome 22 (TMAP RH78571).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the calcium-dependent (C-type) lectin family, such as
CLEC10A, recognize carbohydrate chains and are involved in host defense
mechanisms (Suzuki et al., 1996).

CLONING

By screening an interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680)-activated peripheral blood
monocyte cDNA library with a hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor (see
108360) probe, Suzuki et al. (1996) isolated a cDNA encoding HML (human
macrophage lectin). The predicted 292-amino acid type II transmembrane
protein has a cytoplasmic domain with a tyr-glu-asn-phe (YENF)
internalization signal, a transmembrane domain, a neck domain, and a
C-type lectin domain (also called a carbohydrate recognition domain, or
CRD) containing a gln-pro-asp motif. Western blot analysis showed that
HML had an apparent molecular mass of 35 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analysis by Suzuki et al. (1996) indicated that HML bound
specifically to galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine in the presence of
calcium.

MAPPING

Gross (2010) mapped the CLEC10A gene to chromosome 17p13.1 based on an
alignment of the CLEC10A sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC027858) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Mgl1 and Mgl2 are mouse homologs of human MGL that have distinct binding
specificities. Westcott et al. (2009) examined the impact of
diet-induced obesity on inflammation and metabolism in mice lacking
Mgl1, a marker of alternatively activated macrophages. Mgl1 was not
required for trafficking of antiinflammatory type-2 adipose tissue
macrophages to adipose tissue. Obese Mgl1 -/- mice were protected from
glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and steatosis, despite having
more visceral fat, and this protection was associated with significantly
reduced inflammatory type-1 Cd11c (ITGAX; 151510)-positive macrophages.
FACS analysis revealed that Mgl1 was expressed on inflammatory 7/4(hi)
monocytes, and obese Mgl1 -/- mice had lower levels of 7/4(hi)
monocytes. Westcott et al. (2009) concluded that Mgl1 is a cell surface
receptor involved in the regulation of monocyte/macrophage activation
and trafficking to fat in obesity.

147267	TITLE *147267 INOSITOL 1,4,5-TRIPHOSPHATE RECEPTOR, TYPE 3; ITPR3
;;IP3R3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

ITPR3 transduces many hormonal signals that regulate Ca(2+)-dependent
processes in the intestinal epithelium. Maranto (1994) described
complete sequence of the ITPR3 polypeptide (2,671 amino acids). Primary
structure analysis indicated a pattern of conserved and variable
regions, characteristic of the particular gene family.
Immunocytochemical localization in the intestine was determined.

Yamamoto-Hino et al. (1994) showed that the type 3 receptor was present
in all hematopoietic and lymphoma cell lines tested.

See also 147265.

MAPPING

Ozcelik et al. (1991) found that a cDNA probe for ITPR3 hybridized to
DNA from hybrid cells containing human chromosome 6. In one hybrid that
carried 6pter-p21, in the absence of an intact copy of this chromosome,
hybridization was observed, thus mapping the gene to 6pter-p21.

Yamamoto-Hino et al. (1994) likewise mapped the ITPR3 gene to chromosome
6, specifically to 6p21, by isotopic in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2012) showed in mice that glucagon stimulates CRTC2
(608972) dephosphorylation in hepatocytes by mobilizing intracellular
calcium stores and activating the calcium/calmodulin-dependent
ser/thr-phosphatase calcineurin (PPP3CA; 114105). Glucagon increased
cytosolic calcium concentration through the PKA-mediated phosphorylation
of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs) (ITPR1, 147265;
ITPR2, 600144; ITPR3), which associated with CRTC2. After their
activation, InsP3Rs enhanced gluconeogenic gene expression by promoting
the calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of CRTC2. During feeding,
increases in insulin signaling reduced CRTC2 activity via the AKT
(164730)-mediated inactivation of InsP3Rs. InsP3R activity was increased
in diabetes, leading to upregulation of the gluconeogenic program. As
hepatic downregulation of InsP3Rs and calcineurin improved circulating
glucose levels in insulin resistance, these results demonstrated how
interactions between cAMP and calcium pathways at the level of the
InsP3R modulate hepatic glucose production under fasting conditions and
in diabetes.

type 1 diabetes, see 222100.

ANIMAL MODEL

Futatsugi et al. (2005) generated mice lacking ITPR2 (600144) or ITPR3
or both by targeted disruption. The single-gene mutants were viable and
showed no distinct abnormalities in appearance, at least for several
months after birth. Mutant mice lacking both of these ITPRs were also
viable during the embryonic period. At birth, double mutants were
indistinguishable from nonhomozygous littermates, but double mutants
gained less body weight after birth. After the weaning period, around
postnatal day 20, double-knockout mice began losing weight and died by
the fourth week of age. Double mutants did not eat dry food, but when
fed wet mash beginning on postnatal day 20, they consumed this type of
food and survived thereafter. Body weight increases of the double
mutants were still smaller than those of their non-double-mutant
littermates, despite consuming the same quantity of food. Futatsugi et
al. (2005) found that these double mutants had exocrine dysfunction
which caused difficulties with nutrient digestion. Severely impaired
calcium signaling in acinar cells of the salivary glands and the
pancreas in the double mutants ascribed the secretion deficits to a lack
of intracellular calcium release. Despite a normal caloric intake, the
double mutants were hypoglycemic and lean. Futatsugi et al. (2005)
concluded that these results revealed ITPR2 and ITPR3 as key molecules
in exocrine physiology underlying energy metabolism and animal growth.

;;COX19, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

COX19 encodes a cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-assembly protein. The S.
cerevisiae Cox19 protein may play a role in metal transport to the
mitochondrial intermembrane space and assembly of complex IV of the
mitochondrial respiratory chain (Sacconi et al., 2005).

CLONING

Using database analysis with S. cerevisiae Cox19 as query, followed by
PCR techniques, Sacconi et al. (2005) cloned COX19 cDNA from skin
fibroblasts. The deduced 90-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular
mass of about 10.4 kD. COX19 is a hydrophilic protein and shares 4
conserved cysteine residues with COX17 (604813). Northern blot analysis
detected 3.6-kb, 4.6-kb, and 6.0-kb transcripts in all tissues examined
with highest expression in skeletal muscle. RACE analysis identified a
transcript of 3,602 nucleotides. Fluorescence microscopy showed that
COX19 expressed in HEK293 cells had a diffuse cytosolic localization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sacconi et al. (2005) determined that the COX19 gene contains 3 exons
spanning about 12 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sacconi et al. (2005) mapped the COX19
gene to chromosome 7p22.3

615383	TITLE *615383 FIDGETIN-LIKE PROTEIN 1; FIGNL1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FIGNL1 is part of an interaction network required for efficient repair
of DNA double-strand breaks via homologous recombination (Yuan and Chen,
2013).

CLONING

RAD51 (179617) is a major recombinase with critical roles in meiotic
recombination and in repair of DNA double-strand breaks via homologous
recombination in mitotic cells. By affinity purification of proteins
that interacted with RAD51 in human 293T cells, followed by mass
spectrometry, Yuan and Chen (2013) identified FIGNL1. The deduced
674-amino acid protein contains a central RAD51-binding domain, followed
by an AAA-type ATPase domain and a C-terminal Vps4 (see 609982)-like
domain. Database analysis revealed orthologs of FIGNL1 in rodents,
Danio, Xenopus, and Drosophila.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis of human 293T cells, Yuan and Chen
(2013) confirmed interaction between endogenous FIGNL1 and RAD51. Both
proteins were recruited to sites of DNA damage. Truncation analysis
revealed that amino acids 1 to 120 of FIGNL1 were required for
recruitment of FIGNL1 to nuclear foci following DNA damage and that
amino acids 295 to 344 were required for interaction of FIGNL1 with
RAD51. Knockdown of FIGNL1 via short hairpin RNA increased cell
sensitivity to chemical- and ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage.
Mutation of FIGNL1 within the RAD51-binding domain abrogated DNA damage
repair, indicating that RAD51 was required for FIGNL1-dependent
homologous recombination. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that
FIGNL1 also interacted with the nuclear protein KIAA0146 (SPIDR;
615384), and mutation analysis showed that amino acids 121 to 240 of
FIGNL1 were required for the interaction. Knockdown of KIAA0146 or
deletion of the KIAA0146-binding region of FIGNL1 resulted in defective
homologous recombination repair. Use of knockout mouse embryonic
fibroblasts showed that the DNA damage response by Fignl1 and Kiaa0146
also required Mdc1 (607593), Rnf8 (611685), and ser139-phosphorylated
histone H2ax (601772). FIGNL1 and KIAA0146 appeared to function in a DNA
repair pathway that was independent of another RAD51-interacting
protein, RAD51AP1 (603070).

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the FIGNL1 gene to chromosome 7p12.1 based on an
alignment of the FIGNL1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK023142) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a human chromosome 6-specific library with a B30.2
domain-encoding exon that had been mapped to 6p21.3 as the probe, Henry
et al. (1997) obtained a cDNA encoding RFB30. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 481-amino acid protein contains a RING finger-B box
domain encoded by exon 1, a coiled-coil domain encoded by exons 2
through 6, and a B30.2 domain encoded by exon 7.

Harada et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding mouse Herf1. Northern blot
analysis of mouse tissue detected a 2.3-kb transcript only in spleen and
bone marrow erythroid cells. In embryonic mice, expression was detected
on day 11.5 at the beginning of erythropoiesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Henry et al. (1997) determined that the TRIM10 gene contains at least 7

;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 13; ZNF13;;
KOX5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zinc finger genes represent a large family of more than 500 genes in the
human genome that are involved in transcription regulation. A subgroup
of these genes contains a conserved motif, the KRAB domain (see 601742),
at the N-terminal region. The KRAB domain possesses a potent
transcriptional repression activity. Constantinou Deltas et al. (1996)
determined the complete 2,046-bp coding sequence for one such gene,
ZNF45. The predicted protein product contains 682 amino acids.

Shannon and Stubbs (1998) found that the predicted ZNF45 protein
contains KRAB A and B domains, a spacer region, and 17 tandemly arrayed
zinc fingers of which 2 are degenerate. Northern blot analysis of adult
human tissues detected a 3.5-kb ZNF45 transcript in many tissues
including spleen, thymus, blood leukocytes, pancreas, small intestine,
colon, heart, brain, skeletal muscle, testis, prostate, ovary, and
placenta.

GENE STRUCTURE

Constantinou Deltas et al. (1996) determined the exon/intron arrangement
and splice junctions of the ZNF45 gene. Exon 2 codes exclusively for the
KRAB-A element of 42 amino acids, and exon 4 contains 19 zinc finger
repeats.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization,
Rousseau-Merck et al. (1993) demonstrated that the KOX22 (ZNF224;
194555) gene and the KOX5 (ZNF45) genes map to 19q13.2-qter.
Furthermore, by pulsed field gel electrophoresis experiments they showed
that the pair of genes lie within a DNA segment less than 300 kb long.

Constantinou Deltas et al. (1996) generated an expressed sequence tag
from the 3-prime end of ZNF45 and used it for PCR screening of a
P1-derived genomic library. In this way they isolated a 65-kb clone that
was used for localizing the gene on 19q13.2 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

By PCR, Shannon and Stubbs (1998) localized the ZNF45 gene to a specific
cosmid within a 19q13.2 cosmid contig.

608122	TITLE *608122 PARVIN, GAMMA; PARVG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the parvin family, including PARVG, are actin-binding
proteins associated with focal contacts.

CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to mouse Parva
(608120), followed by RT-PCR of a human T-cell line cDNA library, Olski
et al. (2001) cloned human PARVG. Mouse and human PARVG encode a deduced
331-amino acid protein that contains a single actin-binding domain made
up of 2 calponin (600806) homology domains separated by a linker region.
Unlike PARVA and PARVB (608121), the N terminus of PARVG does not
contain nuclear localization signals or SH3-binding domains.

By analyzing PARVG ESTs, Korenbaum et al. (2001) identified
alternatively spliced sequences and a single polyadenylation site.
Northern blot analysis revealed a strong smeared signal in heart, liver,
and several other tissues. Bands of about 1.6 and 4.0 kb were detected
in peripheral blood and spleen. RNA dot blot analysis detected highest
expression in lymphatic organs (spleen, thymus, lymph node, bone marrow,
and peripheral blood leukocytes) and moderate expression in the
digestive tract (stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, ileocecum, and
appendix), lung, and liver. In contrast, mouse Parvg showed highest
expression in testis, where there were at least 6 mRNA species. A 2.8-kb
Parvg transcript was expressed highly in spleen, moderately in lung, and
weakly in brain and heart. Parvg was expressed throughout mouse
embryonic development, with downregulation at embryonic day 11.
Korenbaum et al. (2001) stated that fluorescence-tagged PARVG, like
PARVA, localized at focal contacts.

GENE STRUCTURE

Korenbaum et al. (2001) determined that the PARVG gene contains 15 exons
and spans about 25 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Korenbaum et al. (2001) mapped the PARVG
gene to chromosome 22q13.31, where it lies head to tail about 12 kb
telomeric to the PARVB gene.

;;MAP/MICROTUBULE AFFINITY-REGULATING KINASE-LIKE 1; MARKL1;;
KIAA1860
DESCRIPTION Disruption of the WNT (164820) signaling pathway due to alteration in
the APC (611731), CTNNB1 (116806), or AXIN1 (603816) genes occurs in
various human cancers. CTNNB1 is normally phosphorylated by a complex of
APC, AXIN1, and GSK3B (605004) and subsequently degraded through the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Mutation of these kinases leads to CTNNB1
accumulation in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus.

CLONING

Using cDNA microarray to identify genes associated with LEF (153245)
activity in hepatoma cells expressing AXIN1, APC, or LacZ, followed by
genomic sequence analysis and 5-prime RACE, Kato et al. (2001) obtained
a cDNA encoding MARKL1. Sequence analysis predicted that the 752-amino
acid MARKL1 protein, 62% identical to MARK3 (602678), contains an
N-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain, a central
ubiquitin-associated domain, and a C-terminal KA1 (600282)-associated
kinase domain. A smaller transcript, MARKL1S, lacking exon 16 and the
KA1-associated kinase domain in the 688-amino acid protein, was also
detected exclusively in brain. RT-PCR analysis detected upregulated
expression in nearly all clinical hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of a 3.6-kb
transcript, with highest expression in testis. Immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated homogeneous cytoplasmic expression.
Colony-forming assays showed that MARKL1 antisense reduced the growth of
SNU475 cells. Kato et al. (2001) concluded that MARKL1 provides a growth
advantage to cells.

By searching for sequences encoding large proteins expressed in brain,
Nagase et al. (2001) identified a partial cDNA encoding MARKL1, which
they designated KIAA1860. The protein was predicted to be a homolog of
the mouse protein kinase Emk2.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Kato et al. (2001) determined that the
MARKL1 gene contains 18 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kato et al. (2001) mapped the MARKL1 gene
to chromosome 19q13.2.

604570	TITLE *604570 SHROOM FAMILY MEMBER 3; SHROOM3
;;SHROOM, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; SHRM;;
KIAA1481
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using gene trap mutagenesis, Hildebrand and Soriano (1999) identified a
mutation in mice that caused exencephaly, acrania, facial clefting, and
spina bifida, all of which could be attributed to failed neural tube
closure. This mutation was designated 'shroom' (shrm), because the
neural folds 'mushroom' outward and do not converge at the dorsal
midline. By 5-prime RACE and library screening, the cDNA for the trapped
gene was cloned. Sequence analysis indicated there are at least 2 shrm
transcripts that encode 2 different putative protein products. The
longest predicted transcript, shrmL, encodes a protein of 1,986 amino
acids, while the second transcript, shrmS, encodes a protein of 1,808
amino acids that lacks the N-terminal 177 amino acids of shrmL. Shrm is
a PDZ domain-containing protein related to Xenopus Apx and human APXL
(SHROOM2; 300103).

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned SHRM, which they designated
KIAA1481. The deduced protein shares significant identity with human
APXL. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest expression of SHRM in liver,
followed by kidney, ovary, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Intermediate
expression was found in all other tissues and brain regions examined
except skeletal muscle, where there was little to no expression.

GENE FUNCTION

Hildebrand and Soriano (1999) found that Shrm is involved at several
levels in regulating aspects of cytoarchitecture. First, endogenous shrm
localized to adherens junctions and the cytoskeleton. Second,
ectopically expressed Shrm altered the subcellular distribution of
F-actin. Third, Shrm directly bound F-actin. Finally, cytoskeletal
polarity within the neuroepithelium was perturbed in mutant embryos. In
concert, these observations suggested that Shrm is a critical
determinant of the cellular architecture required for proper
neurulation.

In experiments in Xenopus, Lee et al. (2007) showed that SHROOM3 is
necessary and sufficient to induce a redistribution of the microtubule
regulator gamma-tubulin (see 191135). They found that this change in
gamma-tubulin distribution underlies the assembly of aligned arrays of
microtubules that drive apicobasal cell elongation. They concluded that
Shroom family proteins govern epithelial cell behaviors by coordinating
the assembly of both microtubule and actin cytoskeletons.

Hildebrand (2005) found that Shroom localized to the apical junctional
complex in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Overexpression of Shroom
resulted in altered cell morphology with apical constriction and altered
apical cell-cell alignment. Targeting the C-terminal domain of Shroom to
the apical plasma membrane produced similar changes. The neural
epithelia of Schroom-mutant mouse embryos showed a marked reduction in
the apical position of myosin IIB (MYH10; 160776), whereas the positions
of nectin-3 (PVRL3; 607147) and Zo1 (TJP1; 601009) were unaltered.
Hildebrand (2005) concluded that Shroom facilitates the subapical
distribution of nonmuscle myosin IIB, which in turn regulates the tissue
rigidity and cell shape changes required for neural tube closure.

MAPPING

By analyzing a human-rodent hybrid panel, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped
the SHRM gene to chromosome 4.

;;MITOFILIN;;
HEART MUSCLE PROTEIN; HMP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The heart muscle protein gene is expressed predominantly in the heart
and is proposed to be an ATP-driven motor protein that interacts with
cytoskeletal components. Icho et al. (1994) cloned a full-length 2.7-kb
cDNA coding for a 758-amino acid protein. The protein has a possible
ATP-binding domain at the N terminus and a long alpha-helical domain
that could form a coiled-coil structure. Proteins with similar
structures include myosin II (see 160730), an actin-based motor protein,
and kinesin (see 602809), a microtubule-based motor protein.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the IMMT
gene to chromosome 2p11.2 (TMAP G62066).

;;MSL1V1;;
KIAA1267
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The KANSL1 gene encodes a nuclear protein that plays a role in chromatin
modification. It is a member of a histone acetyltransferase (HAT)
complex (Smith et al., 2005).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult human brain
cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned KIAA1267. The deduced protein
contains 1,105 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression in
liver and intermediate expression in all other adult and fetal tissues
and specific adult brain regions examined, except subthalamic nuclei,
where no expression was detected.

Smith et al. (2005) noted that KIAA1267, which they called MSL1V1, and
MSL1 (614801) share similarity at their C termini.

GENE FUNCTION

Smith et al. (2005) showed that MSL1V1 associated with MOF (MYST1;
609912) in a protein complex that showed histone acetyltransferase (HAT)
activity toward nucleosomal histone H4 (see 602822). This MOF complex
showed a strong preference for acetylation of H4 lys16 (H4K16).

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the KIAA1267
gene to chromosome 17.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a girl with mental retardation and characteristic facial features
(Koolen-De Vries syndrome; 610443), Zollino et al. (2012) identified a
de novo heterozygous truncating mutation in the KANSL1 gene
(612452.0001). The girl had classic features of chromosome 17q21.31
deletion syndrome, but did not have a deletion on FISH or array CGH
analysis; the mutation was identified by exome sequencing. Direct
sequencing of this gene in another unrelated girl with features of the
disorder in whom no deletion could be detected identified a second de
novo truncating mutation (612452.0002). Both had failure to thrive in
infancy, hypotonia, delayed psychomotor development, and a friendly
demeanor. Characteristic facial features included broad forehead,
upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, 'pear'-shaped nose with
bulbous nasal tip, long philtrum, large ears, broad chin, abnormal hair
texture, and sparse eyebrows. Both also had joint hyperextensibility.
The findings indicated that point mutation in the KANSL1 gene is
sufficient for full manifestations of chromosome 17q21.31 deletion
syndrome, and indicated that it is a monogenic disorder caused by
haploinsufficiency of KANSL1.

By Sanger sequencing of the KANSL1 gene in 16 individuals with features
of 17q21.31 deletion syndrome who did not have copy number variations in
the MAPT (157140) or KANSL1 genes, Koolen et al. (2012) identified
different de novo heterozygous truncating mutations in the KANSL1 gene
(612452.0003 and 612452.0004) in 2 unrelated patients. Both patients had
delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability, hypotonia,
friendly personality, and characteristic facial features, including
broad forehead, long face, upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal
folds, and tubular nose with bulbous nasal tip. Both also had joint
laxity, slender lower limbs, pes planus, sacral dimple, and abnormal
hair color or texture. One patient had additional features, including
cleft lip/palate, ventricular septal defect, cryptorchidism,
hypermetropia, strabismus, and scoliosis. Whole-transcriptome sequencing
of 3 individuals with the classic 17q21.31 deletion showed that
expression levels of KANSL1 were reduced by half. Whole-transcriptome
sequencing of 1 of the patients with a point mutation showed
differential expression of similar genes as those in patients with
deletions; these genes are believed to be involved in neuronal/synaptic
processes. The findings showed that haploinsufficiency of KANSL1 is
sufficient to cause the classic 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome
phenotype, and provided evidence that the histone acetyltransferase
complex may have a role in human cognitive function and developmental
processes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lone et al. (2010) identified the Drosophila Waharan gene (Wah), a
nuclear protein that is a potential homolog of KANSL1, as a regulator of
endosomal trafficking. Knockdown of Wah in Drosophila caused novel
accumulations of tightly packed electron-dense tubules in muscle. These
tubules coincided with sites at which ubiquitylated proteins and
endosomal and lysosomal markers coaccumulated. The findings suggested a
relationship between nuclear functions and endolysosomal trafficking.

Koolen et al. (2012) demonstrated that tissue-specific knockdown of Wah
in the mushroom bodies of the Drosophila brain caused a 25% reduction in
learning ability, confirming an important role for this gene in the
regulation of complex brain function.

611915	TITLE *611915 VESICULAR, OVEREXPRESSED IN CANCER, PROSURVIVAL PROTEIN 1; VOPP1
;;EGFR-COAMPLIFIED AND OVEREXPRESSED PROTEIN; ECOP;;
GLIOBLASTOMA-AMPLIFIED SECRETED PROTEIN; GASP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes amplified along with EGFR (131550) in
glioblastoma, followed by database analysis and RACE-PCR, Eley et al.
(2002) cloned ECOP, which they called GASP. ECOP contains a signal
peptide and is generally hydrophilic. Northern blot analysis of normal
human tissues detected 3.6- and 4.2-kb transcripts with strong
expression in thymus and ovary, moderate expression in spleen, testes,
colon, and small intestine, and weak expression in placenta, prostate,
and liver. RT-PCR analysis detected ECOP coamplified with EGFR and
overexpressed in about 35% of glioblastomas examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Using transfection studies, Park and James (2005) showed that ECOP
expression increased transcriptional activity of an NF-kappa-B (NFKB;
164011) promoter in a dose-dependent manner. ECOP transcriptional
activity increased 3-fold and 1.5-fold in the presence of IL1-beta
(IL1B; 147720) and TNF-alpha (TNF; 191160) stimulation, respectively.
Mobility shift assays and immunocytochemistry analysis showed that ECOP
increased NFKB DNA binding and nuclear translocation. Overexpression of
ECOP caused an increase in the antiapoptotic effect of NFKB when exposed
to TNF-alpha, with decreased PARP (173870) and procaspase-3 (CASP3;
600636) cleavage detected by Western blot analysis. In contrast, siRNA
knockdown of ECOP had a proapoptotic effect with inhibition of NFKB
activation due to delayed degradation of I-kappa-B kinase-alpha (IKBKA;
600664), which resulted in delayed nuclear translocation as well as
decreased NFKB DNA binding. Park and James (2005) concluded that ECOP is
a regulator of NFKB signaling.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Eley et al. (2002) mapped the ECOP gene to
chromosome 7p11.2

300252	TITLE *300252 PEPTIDYL-PROLYL CIS/TRANS ISOMERASE, NIMA-INTERACTING, 4; PIN4
;;PARVULIN 14; PAR14;;
EPVH
DESCRIPTION The peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase protein family (PPIases)
consists of the cyclophilin (e.g., PPIA; 123840), FK506-binding protein
(FKBPs, e.g., FKBP1A; 186945), and parvulin subfamilies. PPIases have
diverse functions, but in general they are implicated in the folding,
transport, or assembly of proteins. The human parvulin PIN1 (601052) is
implicated in the regulation of mitosis through interaction with CDC25
(157680) and polo-like kinase-1 (PLX1; see 602098).

CLONING

By searching an EST database using human PIN1 and E. coli parvulin
sequences as probes, followed by screening a lung cDNA library, Uchida
et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding PIN4, which they called PAR14
(parvulin-14). Using a similar method, Rulten et al. (1999) isolated a
cDNA encoding PIN4, which they called EPVH (eukaryotic parvulin
homolog). Sequence analysis predicted that the 131-amino acid PIN4
protein contains a PPIase domain preceded by a 40-amino acid glycine-
and lysine-rich N-terminal sequence. PIN4, however, lacks a WW domain, a
nuclear localization motif, and residues required for phosphoprotein
interactions. Multiple-tissue Northern blot analysis detected variable
expression of an approximately 1.0-kb PIN4 transcript in all tissues
tested, with notably lower expression in neuronal tissue. Transmission
electron microscopy demonstrated preferential localization of PIN4 in
the mitochondrial matrix. Functional analysis failed to show PPIase
activity, possibly due to proteolytic degradation or different substrate
requirements.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PIN4
gene to Xq13 (TMAP sts-H61973).

611627	TITLE *611627 FAMILY WITH SEQUENCE SIMILARITY 57, MEMBER A; FAM57A
;;CT120
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis of predicted genes in a chromosome 17p13.3 region
involved in loss of heterozygosity in hepatocellular carcinoma, followed
by 5-prime RACE of a human kidney cDNA library, He et al. (2002) cloned
FAM57A, which they called CT120. They identified 2 isoforms, CT120A and
CT120B, of 257 and 225 amino acids, respectively. The CT120A isoform has
an N-terminal signal peptide, 7 transmembrane regions, 6 phosphorylation
sites, an N-myristoylation site, and an RGD cell attachment motif. The
CT120B isoform lacks a transmembrane region and RGD cell attachment
motif due to alternative splicing of exon 4. Northern blot analysis of
human tissues detected strong expression in pancreas, moderate
expression in heart, placenta, and kidney, low expression in brain,
liver, and skeletal muscle, and no expression in lung. He et al. (2002)
noted that CT120 expression was detected in all tumor cell lines
examined, with highest levels in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line.
Immunocytochemical studies localized CT120 to the plasma membrane in
human hepatoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation studies, He et al.
(2002) determined that CT120 interacted with SLC3A2 (158070) and GGTL3
(GGT7; 612342).

By BrdU incorporation and soft agarose colony formation assay in a
CT120B-overexpressed lung adenocarcinoma cell line, Pan et al. (2005)
found a decreased overall rate of cell growth and significantly reduced
anchorage-independent cell growth. Cells overexpressing CT120B decreased
tumor weight when injected into nude mice. FACS analysis of
nocodazole-treated cells overexpressing CT120B showed significantly
delayed G1/S phase transition compared to controls. The authors
concluded that CT120B inhibited cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo.
They stated that previous results showed increased transforming ability
and tumorigenesis for isoform CT120A. Pan et al. (2005) proposed that
the CT120A and CT120B isoforms exerted antagonistic effects on cell
growth.

GENE STRUCTURE

He et al. (2002) determined that the FAM57A gene contains 5 exons
spanning approximately 10.3 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, He et al. (2002) mapped the FAM57A gene to
chromosome 17p13.3.

607990	TITLE *607990 UBIQUITIN-LIKE PROTEIN CONTAINING PHD AND RING FINGER DOMAINS 1; UHRF1
;;INVERTED CCAAT BOX-BINDING PROTEIN, 90-KD; ICBP90;;
NUCLEAR PHOSPHOPROTEIN, 95-KD; NP95
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

UHRF1 binds to an inverted CCAAT box in the promoter of topoisomerase
II-alpha (TOP2A; 126430). TOP2A introduces transient double-stranded
breaks in DNA, which are required during the cell cycle for DNA
replication, chromosome condensation, and segregation. UHRF1 is likely
involved in TOPO2A expression (Hopfner et al., 2000).

CLONING

By yeast 1-hybrid analysis of a Jurkat leukemia cell line cDNA library
using the second inverted CCAAT box (ICB2) of the TOP2A promoter as
bait, followed by screening an adult thymus cDNA library, Hopfner et al.
(2000) cloned UHRF1, which they called ICBP90. The deduced 793-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 90 kD. ICBP90
contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain partially overlapped by a
leucine zipper domain, followed by a central zinc finger of the PHD
finger type and a C-terminal zinc finger of the ring finger type. It
also has 2 nuclear localization signals, phosphorylation sites for
several kinases, and a consensus Rb1 (614041)-binding sequence. RNA dot
blot analysis detected expression of ICBP90 at highest levels in adult
and fetal thymus, followed by fetal liver, adult bone marrow, testis,
lung, heart, and fetal kidney. Highly differentiated tissues, such as
central nervous system and peripheral blood leukocytes, showed no
detectable expression. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed nuclear
expression of both endogenous HeLa cell ICBP90 and ICBP90 ectopically
expressed in COS-1 cells. Western blot analysis detected ICBP90 at an
apparent molecular mass of 97 kD in confluent HeLa cells; a minor 50-kD
band was also detected. Other bands were observed in proliferating HeLa
cells. Histochemical analysis of appendix showed expression restricted
to areas of cell proliferation (germinal centers and glandular crypts),
where ICBP90 colocalized with TOP2A. Expression of both proteins was
elevated in high-grade breast carcinomas and slightly elevated in
low-grade breast carcinomas.

By Northern blot analysis, Hopfner et al. (2001) detected transcripts of
5.1 and 4.3 kb in several cancer cell lines. The relative amount of each
transcript depended upon the tissue of origin.

GENE FUNCTION

Hopfner et al. (2000) determined that ICBP90 bound the ICB2 of TOP2A in
vivo and in vitro, and that expression of ICBP90 was concomitant with
expression of TOP2A in human lung fibroblasts and several cell lines.
Transfection of ICBP90 into COS-1 cells resulted in enhanced expression
of both ICBP90 and TOP2A.

Bonapace et al. (2002) determined that mouse Np95 is an early target of
the oncogenic DNA virus, adenovirus E1A, during induced proliferation.
E1A induced Np95 expression in terminally differentiated mouse myotubes.
The concomitant expression of Np95 and of cyclin E (123837)-Cdk2
(116953) was sufficient to induce S phase in these cells. In mouse
fibroblasts, expression of Np95 was tightly regulated during the cell
cycle, and its functional ablation abrogated DNA synthesis. Bonapace et
al. (2002) concluded that Np95 is essential for S phase entry.

Bostick et al. (2007) showed that the protein UHRF1, also known as NP95
in mouse and ICBP90 in human, is required for maintaining DNA
methylation. UHRF1 colocalizes with the maintenance DNA
methyltransferase protein DNMT1 (126375) throughout S phase. UHRF1
appears to tether DNMT1 to chromatin through its direct interaction with
DNMT1. Furthermore, UHRF1 contains a methyl DNA binding domain, the SRA
(SET- and RING-associated) domain, that shows strong preferential
binding to hemimethylated CG sites, the physiologic substrate for DNMT1.
Bostick et al. (2007) concluded that UHRF1 may help recruit DNMT1 to
hemimethylated DNA to facilitate faithful maintenance of DNA
methylation.

Sharif et al. (2007) demonstrated that localization of mouse Np95 to
replicating heterochromatin is dependent on the presence of
hemimethylated DNA. Np95 forms complexes with Dnmt1 and mediates the
loading of Dnmt1 to replicating heterochromatic regions. By using
Np95-deficient embryonic stem cells and embryos, Sharif et al. (2007)
showed that Np95 is essential in vivo to maintain global and local DNA
methylation and to repress transcription of retrotransposons and
imprinted genes. Sharif et al. (2007) concluded that the link between
hemimethylated DNA, Np95, and Dnmt1 thus establishes key steps of the
mechanism for epigenetic inheritance of DNA methylation.

Sen et al. (2010) showed that DNMT1 (126375) is essential for epidermal
progenitor cell function. DNMT1 protein was found enriched in
undifferentiated cells, where it was required to retain proliferative
stamina and suppress differentiation. In tissue, DNMT1 depletion led to
exit from the progenitor cell compartment, premature differentiation,
and eventual tissue loss. Genomewide analysis showed that a significant
portion of epidermal differentiation gene promoters were methylated in
self-renewing conditions but were subsequently demethylated during
differentiation. Furthermore, UHRF1, a component of the DNA methylation
machinery that targets DNMT1 to hemimethylated DNA, is also necessary to
suppress premature differentiation and sustain proliferation. In
contrast, Gadd45A (126335) and B (604948), which promote active DNA
demethylation, are required for full epidermal differentiation gene
induction. Sen et al. (2010) concluded that proteins involved in the
dynamic regulation of DNA methylation patterns are required for
progenitor maintenance and self-renewal in mammalian somatic tissue.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Avvakumov et al. (2008) reported the 1.7-angstrom crystal structure of
the SRA domain of human UHRF1 and the 2.2-angstrom structure of the SRA
domain in complex with a 12-bp double-stranded DNA with a central
hemimethylated CpG. In the SRA-DNA complex, the 5-methylcytosine was
flipped out of the duplex DNA and interacted with a binding pocket of
the SRA domain. Two loops in the SRA domain reached through the
resulting gap in the DNA from both the major and minor grooves to read
the other 3 bases of the CpG duplex. The major groove loop appeared to
confer both specificity for the CpG dinucleotide and discrimination
against methylation of deoxycytidine of the complementary strand.

Arita et al. (2008) and Hashimoto et al. (2008) determined the crystal
structure of the SRA domain of mouse Uhrf1 in complex with
hemimethylated CpG and presented findings similar to those of Avvakumov
et al. (2008).

GENE STRUCTURE

Hopfner et al. (2001) determined that the ICBP90 gene contains 8 exons
and spans about 35 kD. Exons 1 and 2 are noncoding. The promoter region
contains 3 Sp1 (189906)-binding sites.

MAPPING

By FISH, Hopfner et al. (2001) mapped the UHRF1 gene to chromosome
19p13.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Muto et al. (2002) determined that inactivation of mouse Np95 was lethal
to midgestation embryos. Using Np95 null embryonic stem cells, they
found that lack of Np95 expression increased cell sensitivity to
inhibition of DNA replication and to DNA damaging agents, including
x-rays, ultraviolet light, and alkylation.

603002	TITLE *603002 TRANSPORTIN 2; TNPO2
;;TRN2;;
KARYOPHERIN BETA-2B; KPNB2B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transportin-1 (KPNB2; 602901) interacts directly and specifically with
M9, the bidirectional transport signal of the nuclear shuttling protein
hnRNPA1 (164017) and mediates hnRNPA1 nuclear import. In the course of
isolating additional transportin-1 cDNAs, Siomi et al. (1997) isolated
cDNAs encoding a related protein that they designated 'transportin-2.'
The sequence of the predicted 894-amino acid protein shares 84% identity
with that of transportin-1. One notable difference is that transportin-2
contains a short extra sequence within the region corresponding to the
M9-interacting domain of transportin-1. Far Western blotting showed that
transportin-2 and transportin-1 have different substrate specificities.
Siomi et al. (1997) suggested that the insert in transportin-2 modifies
its interaction with import substrates.

GENE FUNCTION

Transport of macromolecules between the cell nucleus and cytoplasm
occurs through the nuclear pores and is mediated by soluble carriers
known as karyopherins, transportins, importins, or exportins. Shamsher
et al. (2002) found that transportin-2 forms complexes with the mRNA
export factor TAP (NXF1; 602647) that strictly depend on the presence of
RanGTP. The data supported the conclusion that transportin-2
participates directly in the export of a large proportion of cellular
mRNAs, and that TAP connects transportin-2 to mRNAs to be exported.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TRN2
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP WI-30101).
