608487	TITLE *608487 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5; TRIM5
;;RNF88
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRIM5 belongs to the large tripartite motif protein family, members of
which typically are composed of 3 zinc-binding domains, a RING, unique
B-box type 1 and B-box type 2 domains, followed by a coiled-coil (CC)
region. TRIM proteins use homomultimerization to identify specific cell
compartments.

CLONING

Using a consensus B-box domain to screen dbEST databases, Reymond et al.
(2001) identified 37 TRIM members in mammals, 21 of which were novel, as
well as 34 splice variants. TRIM5 has 6 variants termed alpha, beta,
gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta, all of which lack a B-box type 1
domain. Additional domains C-terminal to the CC region are variably
present. TRIM5-zeta lacks RING, B-box, and CC domains, but possesses 3
RFP-like domains. Northern blot analysis of adult human tissues detected
ubiquitous expression of TRIM5. Using interaction mating and mutation
analysis, Reymond et al. (2001) confirmed that TRIM5, like most TRIMs,
homointeracts through the CC region. Interaction was also detected with
TRIM6 (607564). Green fluorescent protein microscopy demonstrated
expression as cytoplasmic speckles, possibly in novel subcellular
compartments.

Stremlau et al. (2004) determined that human TRIM5-alpha contains 493
amino acids and includes a C-terminal b30.2 (SPRY) domain missing in
other TRIM5 isoforms.

GENE FUNCTION

By fluorescence microscopy and mutation analysis, Xu et al. (2003)
showed that TRIM5-delta interacts with BTBD1 (608530) and BTBD2
(608531), apparently serving as a scaffold for the assembly of
endogenous BTBD1/2 proteins, dependent on the presence of the CC region
and a wildtype RING domain. TRIM5-delta exhibits ubiquitylation in the
presence of UBCH5B (UBE2D2; 602962), dependent on the presence of
zinc-coordinating cysteines in the RING domain.

Kaiser et al. (2007) reported the reconstruction of the core protein of
a 4-million-year-old endogenous virus from the chimpanzee genome
(PtERV1) and showed that the human variant of the intrinsic immune
protein TRIM5-alpha can actively prevent infection by this virus.
However, Kaiser et al. (2007) suggested that the selective changes that
have occurred in the human lineage during the acquisition of resistance
to this virus, and perhaps similar viruses, may have left our species
more susceptible to infection by HIV-1.

Pertel et al. (2011) demonstrated that TRIM5 promotes innate immune
signaling and that this activity is amplified by retroviral infection
and interaction with the capsid lattice. Acting with the heterodimeric
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13-UEV1A, TRIM5 catalyzes the synthesis
of unattached K63-linked ubiquitin chains that activate the TAK1
(602614) kinase complex and stimulate AP1 (see 165160) and NF-kappa-B
(see 164011) signaling. Interaction with the HIV-1 capsid lattice
greatly enhanced the UBC13-UEV1A-dependent E3 activity of TRIM5, and
challenge with retroviruses induced the transcription of AP1- and
NF-kappa-B-dependent factors with a magnitude that tracked with TRIM5
avidity for the invading capsid. Finally, TAK1 and UBC13-UEV1A
contributed to capsid-specific restriction by TRIM5. Pertel et al.
(2011) concluded that the retroviral restriction factor TRIM5 has 2
additional activities that are linked to restriction: it constitutively
promotes innate immune signaling, and it acts as a pattern recognition
receptor specific for the retrovirus capsid lattice.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Reymond et al. (2001) mapped the TRIM5
gene to chromosome 11p15, in a cluster with TRIM6, TRIM21 (109092),
TRIM22 (606559), TRIM34 (605684), and a TRIM pseudogene. The authors
noted that, apart from another cluster in the HLA region (chromosome
6p21-23), TRIM genes are dispersed throughout the genome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Stremlau et al. (2004) noted that HIV-1, the cause of acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans, efficiently enters the cells
of Old World monkeys but encounters a block before reverse
transcription. The block acts on the HIV-1 capsid and is mediated by a
dominant repressive factor. By screening HeLa cell lines transduced with
a cDNA library from rhesus fibroblasts, Stremlau et al. (2004)
identified HeLa cells expressing rhesus TRIM5-alpha. These cells were
resistant to HIV-1 but not simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)
infection. PCR analysis indicated a disruption of viral cDNA synthesis
in rhesus TRIM5-alpha-expressing cells. Mutation analysis suggested that
both the N-terminal RING and C-terminal SPRY domains of rhesus
TRIM5-alpha contribute to its HIV-1 inhibitory activity. Short
interfering (si) RNA experiments reducing rhesus TRIM5-alpha expression
resulted in increased efficiency of HIV-1 infection. Stremlau et al.
(2004) concluded that monkey TRIM5-alpha is the repressive factor
inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcription and proposed that rhesus
TRIM5-alpha may directly bind and ubiquitinate the HIV-1 viral capsid.

Sayah et al. (2004) showed that knockdown of owl monkey CYPA (123840) by
RNA interference (RNAi) correlated with suppression of anti-HIV-1
activity. However, reintroduction of CYPA to RNAi-treated cells did not
restore antiviral activity. A search for additional RNAi targets
identified TRIMCYP, an RNAi-responsive mRNA encoding a TRIM5/CYPA fusion
protein. TRIMCYP accounts for post-entry restriction of HIV-1 in owl
monkeys and blocks HIV-1 infection when transferred to otherwise
infectable human or rat cells. Sayah et al. (2004) suggested that
TRIMCYP arose after the divergence of New and Old World primates when a
LINE-1 retrotransposon catalyzed the insertion of a CYPA cDNA into the
TRIM5 locus. They concluded that this was the first vertebrate example
of a chimeric gene generated by this mechanism of exon shuffling.

Sakuma et al. (2007) showed that rhesus Trim5-alpha, but not human
TRIM5-alpha, blocked late-phase HIV-1 production through rapid
degradation of HIV-1 Gag polyproteins. In agreement with Sakuma et al.
(2007), Zhang et al. (2008) found that rhesus Trim5-alpha could block
late-stage HIV-1, but not macaque SIV, production. However, the amount
of Trim5-alpha required for this effect was much higher than that
endogenously expressed, and they questioned the biologic significance of
the finding. In a reply, Sakuma et al. (2008) suggested that technical
differences, such as cell lines and capsid sequences, may explain the
need for high Trim5-alpha expression in the experiments of Zhang et al.
(2008).

610171	TITLE *610171 CALMODULIN-LIKE 6; CALML6
;;CALGLANDULIN-LIKE PROTEIN; CAGLP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching with the sequence of the 4-EF hand-containing
calglandulin protein in Bothrops insularis snake as query, followed by
PCR analysis, Chen et al. (2004) cloned human CALML6, which they called
CAGLP, from skeletal muscle. The deduced 181-amino acid protein contains
4 EF-hand motifs and shares 80% sequence identity with the snake
protein. RT-PCR analysis detected a single transcript at highest levels
in skeletal muscle but also in prostate, thymus, heart, bone marrow, and
ovary. Western blot analysis of a CAGLP-EGFP fusion product in HeLa
cells showed that CAGLP has a molecular mass of 19 kD. Fluorescence
microscopy localized the CAGLP-EGFP fusion protein throughout the cell,
with a higher accumulation in cytoplasm than in the nucleus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (2004) determined that the CAGLP gene contains 6 exons. They
found some evidence of a shorter splice variant lacking the second exon,
but the predicted shorter transcript was not detected in RT-PCR
analysis.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chen et al. (2004) mapped the CAGLP gene
to chromosome 1p36.33.

602971	TITLE *602971 TUBULIN-SPECIFIC CHAPERONE C; TBCC
;;COFACTOR C IN BETA-TUBULIN FOLDING; CFC
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequence analysis, Tian et al. (1996) identified yeast homologs of
cofactors D (cin1) and E (pac2), characterized by mutations that affect
microtubule function.

Cofactors essential for the generation of assembly-competent alpha- and
beta-tubulin were identified in in vitro folding reactions (Gao et al.,
1993). Cofactor A was isolated and its sequence deduced from a cloned
cDNA by Gao et al. (1994). Tian et al. (1996) identified cofactors D, E,
and C.

GENE FUNCTION

Microtubules are essential and ubiquitous elements of the cytoskeleton.
Their filamentous arrays contribute to an impressive diversity of
biologic functions that include cell division, intracellular transport,
and the maintenance of cellular architecture. The subunit from which
microtubules are assembled is the tubulin heterodimer, which consists of
1 alpha- and 1 beta-tubulin polypeptide, each of about 50 kD. In vivo
there exists a large class of associated proteins, termed
microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), whose members bind to
microtubules and influence their stability and interaction with other
cellular components. The striking functional diversity of microtubules
depends critically on their dynamic properties and the modulation of
these properties via interaction with MAPs. The first posttranslational
step in the pathway leading to the formation of the tubulin heterodimer
is the folding of newly synthesized alpha- and beta-tubulin polypeptides
into their native configuration. Although in principle proteins contain
within their amino acid sequences all the information that is required
to determine their 3-dimensional structure (Anfinsen, 1973), in many
cases productive folding requires facilitation, an ATP-dependent process
that occurs via interaction with a member of a ubiquitous class of
multisubunit toroidal complexes termed chaperonins. Tian et al. (1996)
described the complete beta-tubulin folding pathway. Folding
intermediates produced via ATP-dependent interaction with cytosolic
chaperonin undergo a sequence of interactions with 4 proteins: cofactors
A, D (604649), E (604934), and C. The postchaperonin steps in the
reaction cascade do not depend on ATP or GTP hydrolysis, although GTP
plays a structural role in tubulin folding. Cofactors A and D function
by capturing and stabilizing beta-tubulin in a quasi-native
conformation. Cofactor E binds to the cofactor D/beta-tubulin complex;
interaction with cofactor C then causes the release of beta-tubulin
polypeptides that are committed to the native state.

Mutations in the retinitis pigmentosa-2 gene (RP2; 300757) cause a
severe form of X-linked retinal degeneration (see 312600). RP2 is a
plasma membrane-associated protein which shares homology with TBCC. The
RP2 protein, like cofactor C, stimulates the GTPase activity of tubulin
in combination with cofactor D. RP2 has also been shown to interact with
ADP-ribosylation factor-like-3 (ARL3; 604695) in a nucleotide- and
myristoylation-dependent manner. Grayson et al. (2002) examined the
relationship between RP2, cofactor C, and ARL3 in patient-derived cell
lines and in the retina. In human retina, RP2 was localized to the
plasma membrane in both rod and cone photoreceptors, extending from the
outer segment through the inner segment to the synaptic terminals. In
contrast, cofactor C and ARL3 localized predominantly to the
photoreceptor-connecting cilium in rod and cone photoreceptors. Cofactor
C was cytoplasmic in distribution, whereas ARL3 localized to other
microtubule structures within all cells. Grayson et al. (2002) suggested
that RP2 may function in concert with ARL3 to link the cell membrane
with the cytoskeleton in photoreceptors as part of the cell signaling or
vesicular transport machinery.

;;CALCIUM CHANNEL, L TYPE, ALPHA-1 POLYPEPTIDE, ISOFORM 6; CACNL1A6
CaV2.3;;
CALCIUM CHANNEL, R TYPE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mouse Cacn1e as probe, Williams et al. (1994) cloned CACNA1E,
which they designated alpha-1E-1, from a hippocampus cDNA library. The
deduced 2,251-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
about 255 kD. Williams et al. (1994) also cloned an isoform that has a
19-amino acid repeat sequence. This isoform, which they called
alpha-1E-3, contains 2,270 amino acids and has a calculated molecular
mass of about 257 kD. There are 24 transmembrane regions, organized into
4 repeats of 6 transmembrane regions, which are characteristic of other
Ca(2+) channel alpha-1 subunits. A large cytoplasmic loop exists between
transmembrane regions IIS6 and IIIS1. Alpha-1E-1 contains 1 casein
kinase II (see 115440) phosphorylation site between transmembrane
regions IIS5 and IIS6, and alpha 1E-3 contains 2. Human alpha-1E-3
shares 61% identity with CACNA1A (601011), 60% identity with CACNA1B
(601012), and 96.3% identity with mouse alpha-1E. The mammalian alpha-1E
sequences share about 67% identity with the marine ray doe-1 sequence.
RT-PCR indicated expression in all neuronal tissues tested, as well as
in human kidney and mouse retina, spleen, and pancreatic islet cells.
Expression was also detected in human neuroblastoma, rat insulinoma, and
mouse anterior pituitary cell lines. In situ hybridization of mouse
brain slices revealed wide expression.

GENE FUNCTION

Williams et al. (1994) showed that expression of CACNA1E in human
embryonic kidney cells and Xenopus oocytes produced high
voltage-activated Ca(2+) currents that inactivated rapidly. The current
size was significantly enhanced by coexpression with neuronal
alpha-2/delta (114204) and beta (see 114207) Ca(2+) channel subunits.

MAPPING

Diriong et al. (1995) mapped the CACNL1A6 gene to 1q25-q31 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Yamazaki et al. (1998) confirmed the
mapping to 1q25-q32 by radiation hybrid analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Matsuda et al. (2001) found that Cacna1e-null mice were heavier than
wildtype mice. In glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests, mutant
mice showed a significantly higher blood glucose level. However,
stress-induced blood glucose changes were similar to wildtype mice.

In Cacna1e-null mice, Jing et al. (2005) observed a 20% reduction in
glucose-evoked insulin secretion. Dynamic insulin release measurements
demonstrated that genetic or pharmacologic Cacna1e ablation strongly
suppressed second-phase secretion, whereas first-phase secretion was
unaffected, both in vitro and in vivo. Suppression of the second phase
coincided with an 18% reduction in oscillatory Ca(2+) signaling and a
25% reduction in hormone-containing granule recruitment after completion
of the initial exocytotic burst in individual null beta cells. Jing et
al. (2005) proposed that CACNA1E channels have a specific role in
second-phase insulin release by mediating the Ca(2+) entry needed for
replenishment of the releasable pool of granules.

;;LECTIN, C-TYPE, SUPERFAMILY MEMBER 2; CLECSF2;;

LECTIN, C-TYPE, ACTIVATION-INDUCED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CLEC2B is a myeloid-specific activating receptor that binds NKp80
(KLRF1; 605029) on natural killer (NK) cells, thereby initiating
cross-talk between myeloid cells and NK cells (Welte et al., 2006).

CLONING

The NK gene complex on chromosome 12p13-p12 encodes CD69 (107273) and
other type II transmembrane proteins with a C-type lectin domain. By
searching an EST database for sequences related to CD69, Hamann et al.
(1997) identified a partial AICL cDNA. They used the partial cDNA to
screen a phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-activated human peripheral
blood mononuclear cell cDNA library and isolated cDNAs corresponding to
the entire AICL coding sequence. The predicted 149-amino acid AICL
protein is a type II membrane protein, with a C-terminal extracellular
C-type lectin domain, a transmembrane region, and a very short
N-terminal cytoplasmic domain. AICL has a molecular mass of
approximately 17 kD. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses showed that AICL
was expressed preferentially in lymphoid tissues and in most
hematopoietic cell types. Transcription of AICL was transiently
upregulated during lymphocyte activation by PMA, with kinetics similar
to those of CD69.

GENE FUNCTION

By generating monoclonal antibodies and using flow cytometric and RT-PCR
analyses, Welte et al. (2006) showed that NKp80 was expressed
predominantly on NK cells, but also on gamma-delta T cells, and that it
induced NK-cell degranulation and cytokine release. FACS and surface
plasmon resonance analyses showed that AICL, a myeloid cell-specific
receptor, interacted with NKp80 at an intermediate on rate and a rapid
off rate. AICL expression was upregulated by a number of Toll-like
receptor (TLR; see 603030) ligands, but not by TLR9 (605474) ligands.
Welte et al. (2006) concluded that AICL is a ligand for the activating
NK receptor NKp80 and that NKp80-AICL interaction induces cytolysis of
myeloid cells and activation of both NK cells and monocytes. They noted
that both molecules are present in humans but not in rodents.

MAPPING

By analysis of mapped YAC clones, Hamann et al. (1997) localized the
CLEC2B gene to the NK gene complex on chromosome 12p13-p12. They found
that the AICL gene lies 0.3 cM proximal to the CD69 gene.

609501	TITLE *609501 TUDOR AND KH DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN; TDRKH
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to ICLN (CLNS1A; 602158),
followed by PCR and screening of a human aorta cDNA library, Lamb et al.
(2000) obtained several TDRKH variants. The variants differ in their
3-prime ends due to alternative splicing or use of alternative
polyadenylation signals. No TDRKH variant shows similarity to ICLN, but
an intronic sequence of TDRKH appears to contain an ICLN pseudogene. The
longest deduced TDRKH protein contains 606 amino acids and has 2 KH
domains and 1 tudor domain. Both KH and tudor domains are involved in
binding RNA or single-strand DNA. TDRKH splice variants encode shorter
proteins that contain only the first KH domain, both KH domains without
the tudor domain, or only the first KH domain with the tudor domain.
Northern blot analysis detected major TDRKH transcripts of about 4.0 and
2.8 kb and minor transcripts of about 4.8, 2.3, and 1.8 kb. Expression
was highest in brain and heart, intermediate in kidney, lung, and small
intestine, and low in muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lamb et al. (2000) determined that the TDRKH gene contains 3
alternatively spliced exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid and genomic sequence analyses, Lamb et al. (2000)
mapped the TDRKH gene to the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) on
chromosome 1q21. The EDC contains a large cluster of related genes

;;HCMOGT1;;
NSP
HCMOGT1/PDGFRB FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for cDNA clones encoding novel structural proteins,
followed by 3-prime and 5-prime RACE of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Sang
et al. (2004) cloned 4 splice variants of the SPECC1 gene, which they
called NSP. Database analysis showed that the SPECC1 gene is almost
identical to the human sperm antigen, HCMOGT1. There are 2 possible
5-prime ends and 2 possible 3-prime ends. The major coding sequence
shared by all isolated transcripts encodes an ATPase domain similar to
that of SMC family members (see SMC1A; 300040) and a coiled-coil domain
commonly seen in motor or structure proteins. Northern blot analysis
detected strong expression of 4.0- and 2.5-kb transcripts in testis. The
larger transcript was also expressed in spleen, but all other normal
tissues examined showed little or no SPECC1 expression. Variable
expression was detected in some human cancer cell lines, including HeLa
cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of HeLa cells detected SPECC1 in the
nucleus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sang et al. (2004) determined that the SPECC1 gene contains 17 exons and
spans at least 227 kb.

MAPPING

Morerio et al. (2004) identified the HCMOGT1 gene as the fusion partner
on chromosome 17p11.2 of the PDGFRB gene in a t(5;17)(q33;p11.2)
translocation.

By FISH, Sang et al. (2004) mapped the SPECC1 gene to chromosome
17p11.2.

CYTOGENETICS

Morerio et al. (2004) identified the HCMOGT1 gene as a novel fusion
partner to the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, beta gene
(PDGFRB; 173410) by study of the translocation t(5;17)(q33;p11.2) in a
case of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (607785). The HCMOGT1 cDNA
sequence was fused in-frame to PDGFRB at nucleotide 1936 and situated
5-prime to the PDGFRB portion, as in previous studies of PDGFRB fusion
partners. PDGFRB, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, is
constitutively activated by gene fusion with different partners in
myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorders with peculiar clinical
characteristics. The patient studied by Morerio et al. (2004) presented
all the features common to patients with PDGFRB rearrangement: male sex,
splenomegaly, monocytosis, and eosinophilia. Nevertheless, peculiar and
noteworthy were both the age at presentation (18 months) and the
hematologic diagnosis (juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia). Most reported
cases with demonstrated PDGFRB involvement present at a median age of 50
to 60 years; pediatric cases are rare.

600811	TITLE *600811 DNA DAMAGE-BINDING PROTEIN 2; DDB2
;;DDB, p48 SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The p48 gene (DDB2) is required for expression of an ultraviolet
radiation (UV)-damaged DNA-binding activity and is disrupted by
mutations in the subset of xeroderma pigmentosum group E (XPE; 278740)
cells that lack this activity, DDB-negative XPE (Hwang et al., 1999).

CLONING

Dualan et al. (1995) isolated full-length human cDNAs encoding the 2
polypeptides of DDB: p127 (DDB1; 600045) and p48 (DDB2).

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Dualan et al. (1995) assigned the
DDB2 gene to chromosome 11p12-p11.

GENE FUNCTION

Nichols et al. (1996) found that overexpression of p48 in insect cells
greatly increased DDB activity in the cells, especially if p127 was
jointly overexpressed. These results demonstrated that p48 is required
for DNA-binding activity.

Hwang et al. (1998) demonstrated that expression of human DDB2 activated
DNA binding by DDB1 in several hamster and human cell lines. No such
effects were observed following expression of DDB2 containing single
amino acid substitutions from XPE cells that lacked binding activity.
DDB2 formed a complex with DDB1 either bound to UV-damaged DNA or in
free solution. Activation of DDB1 occurred by a 'hit-and-run' mechanism,
since the presence of DDB2 was not required for subsequent binding of
DDB1 to UV-damaged DNA. Hamster cells that failed to express Ddb2, which
contains a WD motif with homology to proteins that reorganize chromatin,
also failed to efficiently repair cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in
nontranscribed DNA. Hwang et al. (1998) concluded that DDB2 plays a role
in repairing lesions that would otherwise remain inaccessible in
nontranscribed chromatin.

In human cells, efficient global genomic repair of DNA damage induced by
UV radiation requires the p53 tumor suppressor (191170). Hwang et al.
(1999) showed that p48 mRNA levels strongly depend on basal p53
expression and increase further after DNA damage in a p53-dependent
manner. Furthermore, like p53 -/- cells, XPE cells are deficient in
global genomic repair. These results identified p48 as a link between
p53 and the nucleotide excision-repair apparatus.

Shiyanov et al. (1999) stated that the DDB complex has a transcriptional
function in conjunction with E2F1 (189971), in addition to its role in
the DNA damage response. By coimmunoprecipitation analysis of HeLa cell
nuclear extracts, followed by mass spectrometric analysis and sequencing
of novel tryptic peptides, they found that the DDB complex interacted
with CUL4A (603137), a predicted E3 ubiquitin ligase. The DDB-CUL4A
complex bound UV-damaged DNA.

Tang et al. (2000) found that UV-damaged DNA-binding activity (UV-DDB)
is deficient in cell lines and primary tissues from rodents.
Transfection of p48 conferred UV-DDB to hamster cells and enhanced
removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) from genomic DNA and
from the nontranscribed strand of an expressed gene. Expression of p48
suppressed UV-induced mutations arising from the nontranscribed strand
but had no effect on cellular UV sensitivity. The results defined the
role of p48 in DNA repair, demonstrated the importance of CPDs in
mutagenesis, and suggested how rodent models can be improved to better
reflect cancer susceptibility in humans.

By immunoprecipitation analysis of HeLa cells, Groisman et al. (2003)
identified DDB2 and CSA (609412) as components of similar but distinct
protein complexes. Both DDB2 and CSA interacted with DDB1 (600045), a
component of both complexes. Cullin-4A (CUL4A; 603137), ROC1 (RBX1;
603814), and all the subunits of the COP9 signalosome (e.g., COPS2;
604508) were also present in both complexes. Following UV irradiation,
the DDB2 complex bound tightly to chromatin in a UV-dependent manner and
initiated global genome repair, whereas the CSA complex bound to RNA
polymerase II and initiated transcription-coupled repair. The COP9
signalosome in each complex differentially regulated cullin-based
ubiquitin ligase activity in response to UV irradiation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Nichols (1995) reported that RT-PCR mutation analysis in 5 fibroblast
XPE strains (2 without and 3 with DDB-binding activity) covering 90 to
99% of the sequence of DDB1 revealed no mutations. Approximately 40% of
DDB2 had been sequenced and had revealed no mutations in 2 fibroblast
XPF strains (278760).

Nichols et al. (1996) identified mutations in the DDB2 gene in the 3
known cases of DDB-negative XPE. No mutations were found in the cDNA of
the 127-kD subunit.

Rapic-Otrin et al. (2003) described several genetically unrelated
patients with XPE, each carrying 2 mutated alleles for DDB2, causing
either a single amino acid change (see 600811.0004), a protein
truncation, or internal deletion. These defects resulted in a severe
decrease of detectable p48 protein, abolished interaction with the p127
subunit, and produced a deficiency in UV-DDB binding activity.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP E, DDB-NEGATIVE FORM
DDB2, LYS244GLU

In 1 of the 3 known cases of DDB-negative xeroderma pigmentosum,
complementation group E (278740), Nichols et al. (1996) found an A-to-G
transition causing a lys244-to-glu (K244E) amino acid change in the
48-kD subunit of the DDB heterodimer.

Shiyanov et al. (1999) stated that the K244E mutation in DDB2 interferes
with the DDB1 (600045)-DDB2 interaction in damaged DNA binding assays
and also affects transcriptional activity.

.0002
XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP E, DDB-NEGATIVE FORM
DDB2, ARG273HIS

In 2 of the 3 known cases of DDB-negative xeroderma pigmentosum,
complementation group E (278740), Nichols et al. (1996) found a G-to-A
transition that caused an arg273-to-his (R273H) amino acid change in the
48-kD subunit of the DDB protein.

Shiyanov et al. (1999) stated that the R273H and lys244-to-glu (K244E;
600811.0001) mutations in DDB2 interfere with the DDB1 (600045)-DDB2
interaction in damaged DNA binding assays and also affect
transcriptional activity. They showed that the R273H mutation, but not
the K244E mutation, also abrogated interaction of the DDB complex with
CUL4A (603137).

.0003
XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP E, DDB-NEGATIVE FORM
DDB2, ARG313TER

Itoh et al. (1999) studied a 62-year-old Japanese woman who was first
recognized to be photosensitive at the age of about 20 (see XPE;
278740). There were no complications during pregnancy, labor, or
delivery. The parents were consanguineous. She showed average
development. At the time of study, she had clinical sensitivity to UV
light including pigmented or depigmented macules and patches on the
face, neck, chest, and limbs, especially the dorsa of the hands. The
sun-exposed skin showed slight dryness. Furthermore, she had multiple
skin neoplasms (5 malignant melanomas and 14 basal cell carcinomas on
the face, and 2 squamous cell carcinomas in situ on her forearm and
leg). No mutation of DDB1 (600045) was detected; the DDB2 cDNA showed
homozygosity for a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 937 in exon 7 of
genomic DNA, generating a nonsense mutation in CGA (arg) to TGA (stop)
at codon 313. This would be expected to produce a protein truncated by
115 amino acids.

homozygosity for a 1094G-T transversion in the DDB2 gene, resulting in
an asp307-to-tyr (D307Y) substitution.

;;KALLIKREIN 7;;
PROTEASE, SERINE, 6; PRSS6;;
STRATUM CORNEUM CHYMOTRYPTIC ENZYME; SCCE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KLK7 belongs to the kallikrein subfamily of serine proteases, which are
involved in a variety of enzymatic processes (Gan et al., 2000).

CLONING

The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis, i.e., the
stratified squamous epithelium lining the body surface. The cells of the
stratum corneum, the corneocytes, represent the end stage of the
epidermal differentiation process. Corneocytes are highly resistant
anucleated cells mainly consisting of keratin filaments surrounded by a
crosslinked protein envelope. The mechanical resistance of the stratum
corneum is dependent on the cohesion between individual corneocytes,
which is mediated to a major extent by modified desmosomes. Since a
fraction of epidermal cells continuously leaves the proliferating basal
layer and goes through differentiation, there is a continuous de novo
production of corneocytes. This is balanced to give a constant and
well-regulated stratum corneum thickness by cell shedding at the skin
surface in a process called desquamation. Desquamation means elimination
of stratum corneum cell cohesion in superficial cell layers. It has been
established that proteolysis of intercellular cohesive structures is of
major importance in the series of events preceding desquamation. Stratum
corneum chymotryptic enzyme (SCCE), or kallikrein-7 (KLK7), is a serine
proteinase with an inhibitor profile, pH dependence, and tissue
localization compatible with a role in desquamation. Egelrud (1993)
purified SCCE from human plantar corneocytes. SDS-PAGE indicated that
the purified preparation contained 1 major component with an apparent
molecular mass of 25 kD and 1 minor component with a slightly higher
apparent molecular mass. Both of these components were associated with
chymotrypsin-like activity, although SCCE differed significantly from
bovine chymotrypsin, human cathepsin G (116830), and human mast cell
chymases (see 118938) in its relative activity toward various substrates
and in its inhibitor profile. Hansson et al. (1994) sequenced the
N-terminal region of the native SCCE enzyme. By screening a human
keratinocyte cDNA library with a degenerate oligonucleotide based on the
amino acid sequence of SCCE, they isolated 2 forms of SCCE cDNA that
differed only in the 3-prime untranslated region. The predicted
253-amino acid protein consists of a 22-amino acid signal peptide and a
7-amino acid propeptide followed by the active enzyme. SCCE contains the
conserved active site regions of serine proteinases and a potential
N-glycosylation site. The amino acid sequence homology between SCCE and
human chymotrypsin, cathepsin G, and mast cell chymase, all of which
have chymotryptic activity, did not exceed 40%. Hansson et al. (1994)
demonstrated that SCCE is heterogenously glycosylated. Northern blot
analysis detected 1.2- and 2.0-kb SCCE transcripts in human skin.
Abundant SCCE mRNA expression was restricted to skin, with very low
levels of expression found in brain and kidney. Immunohistochemical
analyses had shown that the SCCE protein is present in high suprabasal
keratinocytes in the epidermis and in the keratinizing inner root sheet
of the hair follicle (Sondell et al., 1994). In the human oral cavity,
only suprabasal keratinocytes at sites where a stratum corneum is formed
contained SCCE.

Yousef et al. (2000) noted the presence of 12 cysteine residues in KLK7,
10 of which are conserved in all serine proteases, and 2 of which are
also found in other KLK proteins. RT-PCR analysis revealed expression
primarily in brain, mammary gland, cerebellum, spinal cord, kidney, and
skin, with lower levels or none detected in other tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Yousef et al. (2000) observed the upregulation of KLK7 expression in a
breast cancer cell in response to estrogens and glucocorticoids.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Yousef et al. (2000) determined that the
KLK7 gene contains 6 exons, 5 of which are coding. The gene spans 6 kb.

MAPPING

By computational analysis, Yousef et al. (2000) mapped the KLK7 gene to
chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4 between KLK6 (602652) and KLK8 (605644).

134650	TITLE *134650 FATTY ACID-BINDING PROTEIN 1; FABP1
;;FATTY ACID-BINDING PROTEIN, LIVER; FABPL;;
Z PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION Fatty acid-binding protein is an abundant constituent of the cytoplasm
that regulates lipid transport and metabolism. It binds free fatty
acids, their CoA derivatives, bilirubin, organic anions, and other small
molecules. See also FABP2 (134640), FABP3 (134651), and FABP4 (600434).
Liver fatty acid-binding protein is required for cholesterol synthesis
and metabolism. Chen et al. (1986) used cDNA of liver FABP in Southern
analysis of human/mouse cell hybrid DNA and assigned the FABPL locus to
2p. Sparkes et al. (1987) confirmed the assignment to chromosome 2 and
regionalized the gene to 2p11 by in situ hybridization. Sweetser et al.
(1987) found that the mouse homolog of this gene is located on
chromosome 6, within 3 cM of the lymphocyte antigen-2 (Ly-2) locus. They
suggested that the liver form of FABP may be identical to the major
liver protein-1 (Lvp-1), which is encoded by a gene situated within 1 cM
of Ly-2.

;;PUTATIVE HUMAN HLA CLASS II-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; PHAP1;;
PHAP I;;
LEUCINE-RICH ACIDIC NUCLEAR PROTEIN; LANP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The putative HLA class II-associated proteins PHAP I and PHAP II were
purified and cloned on the basis of their ability to bind to the
cytoplasmic domain of the HLA DR-alpha chain (142860) (Vaesen et al.,
1994). They may be components of the transmembrane signaling pathway
that is activated after extracellular binding of ligands during the
immune response. Both proteins share extensive stretches of highly
acidic amino acids in their terminal regions, which suggested a nuclear
localization. Indeed, PHAP I is likely to be the human homolog of the
rat 'leucine-rich acidic nuclear protein' (LANP) (83.6% identity), which
is localized in the nuclei of Purkinje cells. Sequence identity
demonstrated that PHAP II is identical to the protein encoded by the
gene SET (600960).

Mutation in ataxin-1 (ATX1; 601556) causes spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1;
164400). Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a mouse brain cDNA library
with mutant human ATX1 as bait, Matilla et al. (1997) isolated a mouse
cDNA encoding Lanp, which is 89% identical to the human protein and is
expressed in cerebellum and brainstem. Binding analysis indicated that
the strongest interaction between the proteins is with the N-terminal
147 residues on Lanp, which contain 5 leucine-rich repeats, and a
full-length ataxin-1 containing 82 glutamines. Immunohistochemical
analysis demonstrated highest levels of Lanp, like Atx1, in the nuclei
of cerebellar Purkinje cells.

MAPPING

Fink et al. (1995) mapped the PHAP1 gene to 15q22.3-q23 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization.

CYTOGENETICS

The SET gene is located on 9q34 and was found to be fused to the
putative oncogene CAN (114350) in a patient with acute undifferentiated
leukemia (von Lindern et al., 1992). The similarities between PHAP I and
SET suggested to Fink et al. (1995) that the PHAP1 gene might also form
a fusion protein with CAN. In the SET-CAN fusion gene, the breakpoint is
located 3-prime of the SET gene, but the last exon of SET is removed in
the fusion transcript. This exon encodes the last 7 amino acids
(EDEGEDD) of SET that are identical with the end of PHAP I except that
PHAP I carries an additional D (EDEGEDDD). The vast majority of cases in
which CAN is involved in acute myeloid leukemia show a specificity for
the t(6;9) translocation (Sandberg et al., 1983) that fuses the 3-prime
part of the CAN gene on 9q34 (von Lindern et al., 1990) to almost the
complete coding region of the DEK gene (125264) on 6p23 (von Lindern et
al., 1992). The translocation breakpoints always occur in intron icb-9
of CAN. The PHAP1/CAN translocation would be expected to cause acute
leukemia. Like DEK and SET, PHAP I contains an extended acidic region
that could result in a transforming capacity.

GENE FUNCTION

By micropeptide sequence analysis of a PP2A (PPP2CA; 176915) inhibitor
and database screening, Li et al. (1996) determined that the inhibitor,
termed I1PP2A, was identical to PHAP1. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that
both proteins, which contain 249 amino acids and a highly acidic
C-terminal tail, have an apparent molecular mass of 30 kD. Functional
analysis showed that recombinant PHAP1 is a potent and specific
inhibitor of PP2A and acts by binding to the C subunit of the
phosphatase.

Jiang et al. (2003) identified a pathway that regulates
mitochondria-initiated caspase activity. In this pathway, PHAP protein
promoted caspase-9 (602234) activation after apoptosome formation,
whereas PTMA (188390) negatively regulated caspase-9 activation by
inhibiting apoptosome formation. A small molecular activator of
caspase-3 (600636), PETCM, relieved PTMA inhibition and allowed
apoptosome formation at a physiologic concentration of dATP. Elimination
of PTMA expression by RNA interference sensitized cells to ultraviolet
irradiation-induced apoptosis and negated the requirement of PETCM for
caspase activation.

605918	TITLE *605918 SPONDIN 2; SPON2
;;MINDIN;;
M-SPONDIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a differential display technique, Manda et al. (1999) isolated 2
novel cDNAs, SPON2 and C20ORF1 (605917), which they designated
differentially expressed in cancerous and noncancerous lung cells-1
(DIL1) and -2 (DIL2), respectively. The full-length SPON2 cDNA encodes a
331-amino acid protein with a domain organization similar to those of
zebrafish mindin-1/mindin-2 and F-spondin (SPON1; 604989): a hydrophobic
signal sequence in the N terminus, an FS1 domain, an FS2 domain, and a
thrombospondin type I repeat. RT-PCR analysis detected no expression of
SPON2 in lung carcinoma cells. Northern blot analysis detected
expression of a 1.9-kb SPON2 transcript in various tissues, including
adult and fetal lung.

He et al. (2004) cloned mouse Spon2, which they termed mindin. The mouse
mindin protein, which is 85% identical to the human protein, is a
conserved member of a family of secreted extracellular matrix proteins.
RNA blot analysis detected expression in a variety of tissues, with
abundant expression in lung and lymphoid tissues. Immunoblot blot
analysis showed expression of a 42-kD protein under reducing conditions
and expression of dimers and oligomers in a concentration-dependent
manner under nonreducing conditions.

GENE STRUCTURE

He et al. (2004) determined that the mouse Spon2 gene contains 6 exons
spanning 5 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SPON2
gene to chromosome 4p16.3 (TMAP WI-22263).

ANIMAL MODEL

By targeted replacement of part of exon 1 and all of exons 2 and 3 of
the Spon2 gene, He et al. (2004) generated Spon2-deficient mice. These
mice had a normal appearance and life span under pathogen-free
conditions. Spon2-deficient mice were resistant to lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-induced shock, and their macrophages only produced slightly
elevated inflammatory cytokines. Addition of Spon2 to Spon2-deficient,
but not Tlr4 (603030)-deficient, macrophages restored their ability to
produce inflammatory cytokines in response to LPS. Stimuli from most
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeast also failed to induce
cytokine responses from Spon2-deficient macrophages and mast cells.
Spon2-deficient mice showed variable clearance of pathogens when
inoculated by the pulmonary and intraperitoneal routes. Fluorescence
microscopy demonstrated Spon2-dependent bacterial agglutination in the
presence of calcium due to a specific interaction with the carbohydrate
moiety of LPS and lipoteichoic acid. Phagocytosis experiments indicated
that Spon2 acts as an opsonin and pattern-recognition molecule for a
range of pathogens. He et al. (2004) proposed that Spon2 recognition of
carbohydrate structures is essential for the activation of macrophages
by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).

;;APOLLON;;
BRUCE, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; BRUCE;;
KIAA1289
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) obtained a partial BIRC6 clone, which they
designated KIAA1289. The deduced 1,592-amino acid peptide shares a high
degree of similarity with a mouse ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme of over
4,800 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected low expression in several
tissues and specific adult brain regions, but not in adult pancreas and
spleen or fetal brain.

Conserved genes that encode inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are
frequently overexpressed in human cancers and are associated with
resistance to therapy. IAPs contain a 70-amino acid cysteine- and
histidine-rich baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) and often a zinc-binding
RING finger. Using PCR with degenerate primers from BIR domains and a
testis cDNA library, Chen et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding a novel
IAP, BIRC6, which they termed Apollon. The deduced 4,830-amino acid
protein is 92% identical to mouse Bruce and 42% identical in the BIR
region to survivin (BIRC5; 603352). Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous expression of a 15-kb transcript. Of 38 human cancer cell
lines examined by Western blot analysis, BIRC6 was expressed as a 530-kD
protein in 4 of 6 brain cancers (gliomas) and 1 of 5 ovarian cancers.

GENE FUNCTION

Chen et al. (1999) found that some brain cancer cell lines with high
expression of BIRC6 exhibited resistance to apoptosis in the presence of
anticancer drugs. Treatment of a high expressing cell line with BIRC6
antisense oligonucleotides reduced BIRC6 expression and reversed the
resistance to anticancer drugs.

Hao et al. (2004) found that cells transfected with human Apollon
resisted cell death induced by transient expression of CASP9 (602234)
and CASP8 (601763), and overexpressing cells resisted cell death induced
by antitumor drugs or death-receptor ligation. Caspase activation by
etoposide, an anticancer drug, was suppressed in cells overexpressing
Apollon. Hao et al. (2004) showed that Apollon bound SMAC (605219),
HTRA2 (606441), and CASP9. They determined that the conserved N-terminal
BIR domain of Apollon bound both SMAC and CASP9, and the N-terminal
IAP-binding motif of SMAC bound Apollon. Apollon functioned as an E2
ubiquitin in polyubiquitinating SMAC and CASP9, which facilitated their
degradation. Mutation analysis indicated that cys327 of Apollon was
required to bind Apollon to SMAC and CASP9, and cys4638 within the UBC
domain of Apollon was critical for its polyubiquitinating activity.

Qiu et al. (2004) found that BRUCE was bound by the C-terminal half of
NRDP1 (RNF41), a ubiquitin ligase that promotes protein ubiquitination
and proteasomal degradation. NRDP1 catalyzed ubiquitination and
proteasomal degradation of BRUCE and promoted apoptosis in response to
apoptotic stimuli in several human cell lines. Decreasing BRUCE content
by RNA interference induced apoptosis. Qiu et al. (2004) concluded that
BRUCE is essential for cell viability.

Pohl and Jentsch (2008) showed that BRUCE was involved in cytokinesis
and abscission in several human cell lines. BRUCE localized to the
midbody ring during cytokinesis, where it bound mitotic regulators and
components of the vesicle targeting machinery. Microscopic studies and
live-cell imaging revealed that BRUCE was involved in the correct
delivery of membrane vesicles to the site of abscission and for the
integrity of the midbody, in particular the midbody ring. BRUCE also
directed relocalization of ubiquitin from the midbody to the midbody
ring. Localization of BRUCE to the midbody ring depended on MKLP1
(KIF23; 605064), a mitotic kinesin essential for the formation of the
midbody matrix. Both BRUCE and MKLP1 were ubiquitinated, and UBPY (USP8;
603158) served as their deubiquitinating enzyme. Pohl and Jentsch (2008)
proposed that BRUCE coordinates multiple steps required for abscission
and that ubiquitination may be a crucial trigger.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the BIRC6 gene
to chromosome 2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hao et al. (2004) found that targeted disruption of the Apollon gene in
mice caused embryonic and neonatal lethality. At embryonic day 15.5,
more than half of the mutant embryos had severely defective angiogenesis
that often coincided with severe edema. At embryonic day 18.5, mutant
embryos were significantly smaller than control littermates, their liver
weight was reduced, and they had a reduced number of hepatocytes, but
they showed no signs of enhanced apoptosis. The growth rate of primary
cultured mutant embryonic fibroblasts was slower than that of controls.
The number of cells in S and G2/M phase was reduced, and the number in
G1 phase was increased. SMAC induced apoptosis in Apollon-deficient
fibroblasts, but not in Apollon-expressing cells. The IAP-binding motif
of SMAC was required to induce apoptosis in Apollon-deficient cells. Hao
et al. (2004) concluded that the interaction between Apollon and SMAC is
essential in preventing SMAC-induced apoptosis.

Lotz et al. (2004) found that the perinatal lethality and growth
retardation of embryonic day-14 Bruce-deficient mice was linked to
impaired placental development. Chorioallontoic placentation initiated
normally, but the mutant placenta showed an impaired maturation of the
labyrinth layer and significant reduction of the spongiotrophoblast.
Lotz et al. (2004) noted no evidence for elevated apoptosis in embryonic
and extraembryonic tissues or in knockout fibroblasts.

613121	TITLE *613121 NEXILIN, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; NEXN
;;NEXILIN-LIKE PROTEIN; NELIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NEXN is a filamentous actin (F-actin; see 102560)-binding protein that
localizes to focal contacts and may be involved in cell adhesion and
migration (Ohtsuka et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2005).

CLONING

Ohtsuka et al. (1998) cloned 2 splice variants of rat nexilin, which
they called b-nexilin and s-nexilin, from brain and cultured
fibroblasts, respectively. The name nexilin came from the Latin word
nexilis, meaning 'bound together.' Full-length b-nexilin contains an
N-terminal F-actin-binding domain (ABD), followed by a spacer, a
coiled-coil region, a second ABD, and a long C-terminal tail. In
comparison, s-nexilin lacks the N-terminal ABD and has an insertion in
the C-terminal tail. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that both
b-nexilin and s-nexilin colocalized with F-actin at focal contacts at
the ends of stress fibers. The nexilins did not localize to cell-cell
junctions. Western blot analysis detected nexilin proteins with apparent
molecular masses above 90 kD in rat brain, testis, and spleen and in
cultured rodent fibroblasts. Neither protein was detected in liver,
kidney, or epithelial cell lines. Wang et al. (2010) stated that the
full-length nexilin protein contains 675 amino acids.

By sequencing clones obtained from a heart cDNA library and by EST
database analysis, Zhao et al. (2001) cloned human nexilin, which they
called NELIN. The deduced 493-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal
FERIN-like domain, followed by an ABD and a C-terminal immunoglobulin
domain. It also has 2 nuclear localization signals. Northern blot
analysis detected a major 4.0-kb transcript in adult and fetal heart and
skeletal muscle only. A minor 2.7-kb transcript, representing the NELIN
cDNA cloned by Zhao et al. (2001), was detected in adult and fetal heart
only.

Using RT-PCR, Wang et al. (2005) cloned NELIN from umbilical vein wall
mRNA. The deduced protein contains 447 amino acids. Northern blot
analysis detected a major transcript of about 3.0 kb in heart and
skeletal muscle. Fluorescence-tagged NELIN localized predominantly to
the cytoplasm of transfected HeLa cells, with some perinuclear
concentration. NELIN colocalized with F-actin.

Using whole-mount antisense RNA in situ hybridization, Hassel et al.
(2009) found that NEXN expression first became detectable in the
developing somite and zebrafish heart tube and remained restricted to
the heart and skeletal muscle throughout embryogenesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang et al. (2010) noted that the NEXN gene contains 13 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhao et al. (2001) mapped the NEXN gene to
chromosome 1p32-p31.

Hassel et al. (2009) noted that the NEXN gene maps to chromosome 1p31.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Using F-actin and deletion constructs of recombinant rat nexilins in
cosedimentation assays, Ohtsuka et al. (1998) showed that b-nexilin has
2 ABDs and that s-nexilin has a single ABD. The coiled-coil region and
the second ABD were required for localization of b-nexilin and s-nexilin
at focal contacts. Pretreatment of F-actin with myosin (see 160730)
subfragment-1, which binds along the sides of F-actin, inhibited F-actin
binding by b-nexilin. This inhibition was reversed by MgATP, which
dissociates the actin-myosin complex. B-nexilin, but not s-nexilin,
increased the viscosity of the nexilin-F-actin complex, and electron
microscopy showed that the increased viscosity was due to F-actin
crosslink formation by b-nexilin. The stoichiometry of nexilin-F-actin
binding appeared to be 1 b-nexilin molecule per about 9 actin molecules
and 1 s-nexilin molecule per about 10 actin molecules. Ohtsuka et al.
(1998) concluded that the nexilins bind along the sides of F-actin, and
that the second ABD of b-nexilin is engaged in F-actin crosslinking.

Wang et al. (2005) found that epitope-tagged NELIN coimmunoprecipitated
with F-actin from rat PC12 cells. HeLa cells overexpressing NELIN showed
increased cell migration and elevated adhesion compared with control
cells.

Hassel et al. (2009) inactivated zebrafish nexilin by morpholino
injection and observed development of severe heart failure. The authors
found that nexilin was dispensable for early heart development,
differentiation of cardiomyocytes, and expression of contractile
elements, but analysis of the ultrastructure of cardiac muscle cells
revealed that although the primary organization of thick and thin
filaments was normal in nexilin-deficient zebrafish hearts, sarcomeric
units were disrupted and frequently detached from the irregular and
blurry Z discs, leaving sarcomeres in tatters. Sarcomere damage became
more extensive as the embryos aged from 48 to 72 hours after
fertilization, suggesting that nexilin has an essential role in the
maintenance of Z disc and sarcomere integrity rather than in the primary
assembly of these structures. Increasing mechanical strain aggravated Z
disc damage in nexilin-deficient skeletal muscle, implying a unique role
of nexilin in protecting Z discs from mechanical trauma.
Immunoprecipitation-western blotting assays indicated that nexilin forms
a complex with alpha-actin (see 102540), beta-actin (102630), and
alpha-actinin (see 102575) at the cardiac Z disc.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Dilated Cardiomyopathy 1CC

Because of evidence that loss of nexilin leads to severe cardiomyopathy
in zebrafish, Hassel et al. (2009) analyzed the NEXN gene in 90 patients
diagnosed with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD) and identified
heterozygosity for a 3-bp deletion (G650del; 613121.0001) in 2 patients
with CMD1CC (613122). Screening of the entire NEXN coding sequence in an
additional 910 CMD patients revealed the G650del mutation in 4 more
patients. In addition, 2 heterozygous missense mutations were detected,
Y652C in 2 patients (613121.0002) and P611T in 1 patient (613121.0003).
None of the mutations were found in 1,251 age-, gender-, ethnicity- and
geography-matched controls. All mutation-positive patients were screened
for mutations in other known CMD-associated genes, but no mutations were
identified.

- Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy 20

Wang et al. (2010) analyzed the NEXN gene in 121 unrelated Han Chinese
patients with CMH who were negative for mutations in 8 common
myofilament-associated genes responsible for CMH, and they identified 2
heterozygous missense mutations in 2 probands (613121.0004 and
613121.0005, respectively) that were located at highly conserved
residues, segregated with disease in each family, and were not found in
192 ethnically matched controls.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1CC
NEXN, 3-BP DEL, 1948GGA

In 6 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1CC; 613122), Hassel et
al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a 3-bp deletion in the NEXN
gene, resulting loss of a conserved gly650 residue (G650del). The
deletion was not found in 1,251 age-, gender-, ethnicity- and
geography-matched controls. One proband had a mildly affected brother
who carried the deletion and an asymptomatic 33-year-old daughter, who
declined further evaluation. Two probands had fathers who did not carry
the deletion, and both obligate-carrier mothers had died of cardiac
failure; 1 of the 2 probands also had 2 brothers who had died of cardiac
failure. All G650del carriers shared an identical haplotype over a large
genomic region surrounding the NEXN gene, suggesting a founder effect.
Ultrastructural analysis of myocardial biopsy tissue from a G650del
patient showed disruption of sarcomeric units with detached and blurry Z
discs, similar to that seen in NEXN-deficient zebrafish. Ectopic
expression of G650-deleted nexilin in zebrafish resulted in dilated
cardiomyopathy, with markedly reduced systolic function and Z disc
disruption. Injection of an equal amount of wildtype nexilin had no
effect on cardiac function or ultrastructure, indicating a
dominant-negative effect of the mutant nexilin.

.0002
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1CC
NEXN, TYR652CYS

In 2 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1CC; 613121), Hassel et
al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a 1955A-G transition in the
NEXN gene, resulting in a tyr652-to-cys (Y652C) substitution at a highly
conserved residue. Both probands had a parent who had died of dilated
cardiomyopathy; 1 proband underwent heart transplantation at age 60
years due to progressive dilated cardiomyopathy. The 2 Y652C mutation
carriers shared a common haplotype that was distinct from the G650del
(613121.0001)-associated haplotype, suggesting a distinct founder
effect; the mutation was not found in 1,251 age-, gender-, ethnicity-
and geography-matched controls. Ultrastructural analysis of myocardial
biopsy tissue from a Y652C patient showed disruption of sarcomeric units
with detached and blurry Z discs, similar to that seen in NEXN-deficient
zebrafish. Ectopic expression of Y652C-mutated nexilin in zebrafish
resulted in dilated cardiomyopathy, with markedly reduced systolic
function and Z disc disruption. Injection of an equal amount of wildtype
nexilin had no effect on cardiac function or ultrastructure, indicating
a dominant-negative effect of the mutant nexilin.

.0003
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1CC
NEXN, PRO611THR

In a patient with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1CC; 613121), Hassel et al.
(2009) identified heterozygosity for a 1831C-A transversion in the NEXN
gene, resulting in a pro611-to-thr (P611T) substitution at a highly
conserved residue that was not found in 1,251 age-, gender-, ethnicity-
and geography-matched controls. Ectopic expression of P611T-mutated
nexilin in zebrafish resulted in dilated cardiomyopathy, with markedly
reduced systolic function and Z disc disruption; injection of an equal
amount of wildtype nexilin had no effect on cardiac function or
ultrastructure, indicating a dominant-negative effect of the mutant
nexilin.

.0004
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 20
NEXN, GLN131GLU

In a 37-year-old Han Chinese woman with familial hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (CMH20; 613876), Wang et al. (2010) identified
heterozygosity for a 391C-G transversion in exon 5 of the NEXN gene,
resulting in a gln131-to-glu (Q131E) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in the N-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD). The mutation was
also detected in the proband's affected brother and daughter, but was
not found in her unaffected daughter or 192 ethnically matched controls.
Transfection studies in C2C12 cells showed that mutant nexilin
accumulated in the cytoplasm and that the expressed fragment of
Q131E-mutant ABD completely lost the ability to bind F-actin (see
102610). Coimmunoprecipitation assays indicated that the Q131E mutation
decreased the binding of full-length NEXN to alpha-actin (102610) and
abolished the interaction between the fragment of ABD and alpha-actin.

CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 20
NEXN, ARG279CYS

In a 45-year-old Han Chinese man with familial hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (CMH20; 613876), Wang et al. (2010) identified
heterozygosity for an 835C-T transition in exon 8 of the NEXN gene,
resulting in an arg279-to-cys (R279C) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in the coiled-coil domain. The R279C mutation was detected in
the proband's affected father and brother, and was also present in his
12-year-old clinically asymptomatic daughter, but was not found in 192
ethnically matched controls. Transfection studies in C2C12 cells showed
that mutant nexilin accumulated in the cytoplasm, but binding to
alpha-actin (102610) was not altered.

612733	TITLE *612733 THO COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 5; THOC5
;;FMS-INTERACTING PROTEIN; FMIP;;
PK1.3;;
FSAP79
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In yeast, the TREX (transcription/export) complex contains the THO
transcription elongation complex, which functions in cotranscriptional
recruitment of mRNA export proteins to the nascent transcript. The human
TREX complex contains ALY (THOC4; 604171), UAP56 (DDX39B; 142560), and
the human counterpart of the THO complex, which includes THOC5. The
human TREX complex appears to be recruited to spliced mRNAs late in the
splicing reaction rather than by direct cotranscriptional recruitment,
as in yeast (Masuda et al., 2005).

CLONING

Using exon amplification to identify genes in a region of chromosome 22
associated with meningioma (607174), followed by screening a fetal brain
cDNA library, Xie et al. (1993) cloned THOC5, which they called PK1.3.
The deduced 683-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
78.5 kD. Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript in all tissues examined, with highest expression in skeletal
muscle, followed by heart and pancreas. A 10-kb transcript was also
detected in brain, placenta, and skeletal muscle.

Tamura et al. (1999) cloned mouse Thoc5, which they called Fmip. Mouse
and human THOC5 share 95.6% amino acid identity. Both contain a central
WW domain-binding motif, followed by an acidic region with 3 potential
phosphorylation sites, and a leucine zipper with 4 heptad repeats. They
also have 2 clusters of basic residues that may act as nuclear
localization signals. Northern blot analysis detected Thoc5 in all mouse
tissues examined, with highest expression in testis, liver, and heart.
Among human fetal tissues, THOC5 was highly expressed in kidney and
liver, with lower expression in lung and brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis and in vitro protein interaction assays,
Tamura et al. (1999) showed that the N-terminal domain of mouse and
human FMIP interacted with the cytoplasmic domain of activated FMS
(CSF1R; 164770), a tyrosine kinase that functions as a receptor for
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF, or CSF1; 120420). Binding
induced rapid FMS-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of FMIP within its
FMS-binding domain, which was followed by dissociation of the 2
molecules. FMIP did not interact with other receptor tyrosine kinases
examined. MCSF treatment induced a bipotential mouse myeloid progenitor
cell line to differentiate into macrophages, but MCSF stimulation in the
presence of overexpressed FMIP induced the same cells to differentiate
into granulocytes. Tamura et al. (1999) concluded that the level of FMIP
determines the differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells into either
macrophages or granulocytes.

Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis of HeLa cell
nuclear extracts, Masuda et al. (2005) found that the human TREX complex
contained THO2 (THOC2; 300395), FSAP79 (THOC5), HPR1 (THOC1; 606930),
UAP56, TEX1 (THOC3; 606929), FSAP35 (THOC6; 615403), ALY, and FSAP24
(THOC7; 611965). Immunodepletion and gel-filtration analyses revealed
that THO2, HPR1, FSAP79, FSAP35, and FSAP24 were tightly associated in
the THO complex, whereas UAP56, ALY, and TEX1 were more loosely
associated. Immunoprecipitation of any TREX component efficiently
immunoprecipitated spliced mRNA and cDNA transcripts, but not unspliced
pre-mRNAs. Immunodepletion of any component had no effect on spliceosome
assembly, splicing, or RNA stability. The TREX complex assembled on
every mRNA examined. Mutation analysis showed that the C terminus of ALY
was required for binding of both UAP56 and the THO complex. The C
terminus of UAP56 was sufficient for ALY binding. The N terminus of
UAP56 interacted weakly with the THO complex and TEX1, suggesting that
other regions of UAP56 are required for maximal binding. Masuda et al.
(2005) concluded that recruitment of the human TREX complex is not
directly coupled to transcription, as in yeast.

Pierce et al. (2008) showed that expression of the human oncogenic
fusion protein TEL (ETV6; 600618)/PDGFRB (173410) in murine myeloid
FDCP-Mix cells increased the expression and phosphorylation of Thoc5.
Inhibition of TEL/PDGFRB with imatinib partially reversed Thoc5
upregulation. Elevated Thoc5 expression led to increased levels of
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdInsP3), suggesting that the
elevated PtdInsP3 levels observed with TEL/PDGFRB expression were due,
at least in part, to Thoc5 upregulation. Thoc5 upregulation also
decreased apoptosis, whereas knockdown of Thoc5 via small interfering
RNA led to rapid cell death. TEL/PDGFRB and several other leukemogenic
tyrosine kinases phosphorylated Thoc5 on tyr225.

Carney et al. (2009) showed that MCSF-stimulated maturation of a mouse
myelogenous leukemia cell line was associated with enhanced Thoc5
expression and phosphorylation. Thoc5 also formed a complex with
Cebp-beta (CEBPB; 189965). Ectopic expression of human THOC5 mimicked
MCSF-mediated cell maturation and enhanced the expression of several
myeloid transcription factors, including CEBP-beta. Increased THOC5
expression also mimicked the MCSF-stimulated increase in PtdInsP3.
Inhibition of the THOC5-induced increase in PtdInsP3 abrogated the
effects of elevated Cebp-beta. Carney et al. (2009) concluded that THOC5
stabilizes transcription factors to potentiate monocytic cell line
development.

GENE STRUCTURE

Xie et al. (1993) estimated that the THOC5 gene spans 100 to 150 kb.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and analysis of a YAC and cosmid contig,
Xie et al. (1993) mapped the THOC5 gene to chromosome 22q12, adjacent
and centromeric to the NF2 gene (607379).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using Thoc5-knockout mice, Pierce et al. (2008) showed that Thoc5 was
required to maintain hematopoietic cells in vivo.

604585	TITLE *604585 NUCLEAR BODY PROTEIN SP100; SP100
;;NUCLEAR ANTIGEN SP100; SP100;;
SPECKLED, 100-KD
SP100B, INCLUDED;;
LYSP100B, INCLUDED;;
SP100-HMG, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The PML/SP100 nuclear bodies (NBs), also referred to as Kr-bodies, ND10,
or PODs, represent a subnuclear 'organelle' whose integrity is
compromised in promyelocytic leukemia (PML). NBs contain the SP100
autoantigen as well as the PML protein (102578) that is part of the
leukemogenic PML-RARA (180240) fusion protein associated with acute PML.

To characterize further the 95- to 100-kD SP100 autoantigen, Szostecki
et al. (1990) isolated overlapping cDNA fragments from HeLa, placenta,
and liver cDNA libraries and obtained a full-length SP100 cDNA. SP100
encodes a 480-amino acid acidic (pI 4.7) protein with multiple
phosphorylation sites for casein kinase type II. Szostecki et al. (1990)
found that anti-SP100 autoantibodies occur predominantly in patients
with primary biliary cirrhosis (109720). The authors noted sequence
similarities with alpha-1 and alpha-2 membrane-associated regions of
human and nonhuman MHC class I antigens.

GENE FUNCTION

Using SP100 as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid system and by GST 'pull down'
experiments, Seeler et al. (1998) showed that SP100 complexes with
members of the HP1 family of nonhistone chromosomal proteins (e.g.,
CBX5, 604478). A variant of SP100, termed SP100B by the authors,
contains additional 3-prime sequence encoding a 688-amino acid protein.
A splice variant of SP100B, termed SP100-HMG, is joined to an 81-amino
acid HMG1 (163905)-like peptide by a 14-amino acid bridge. The HMG1-like
domain is 87% identical and 93% similar to HMG1. SP100-HMG has the
potential to be a DNA-binding protein. All 3 variants, SP100, SP100B,
and SP100-HMG, colocalize with HP1 in NBs, suggesting that the
N-terminal portion of SP100 is responsible for the interaction. HP1
expression is enhanced when SP100 synthesis is induced by interferon.

By Northern blot analysis, Dent et al. (1996) found that SP100B, which
they called LYSP100, is expressed only in lymphoid tissues (spleen,
tonsil, and thymus), mature B-cell lines, and some T-cell lines, but not
in brain, liver, muscle, or nonlymphoid cell lines. They noted that
SP100 expression is widespread. By confocal immunofluorescence
microscopy, they determined that a minority of the nuclear dots for
SP100B overlapped with SP100 and PML, whereas most localized to another
class of subnuclear structures, which they termed LANDs
(LYSP100-associated nuclear domains), which are morphologically and
spatially distinct from PML NBs.

611616	TITLE *611616 NAD KINASE; NADK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NADK catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to NAD to
generate NADP, which in its reduced form acts as an electron donor for
biosynthetic reactions (Lerner et al., 2001).

CLONING

By EST database analysis using prokaryotic DNA kinase sequences as
probe, followed by PCR of a human fibroblast cDNA library, Lerner et al.
(2001) cloned NADK. The deduced 446-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 49.2 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.0-kb
transcript with high expression in placenta, moderate expression in
brain, colon, heart, liver, kidney, lung, spleen, stomach, and testis,
and low expression in small intestine. A band of 1.8 kb was detected in
several tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Using recombinant NADK overexpressed in E. coli, Lerner et al. (2001)
showed that purified NADK catalyzed the synthesis of NADP from NAD and
ATP. By gel filtration analysis, they determined that catalytically
active human NADK was a homotetramer. NADK exhibited a specific activity
of 6.7 microM with a high specificity for NAD and ATP substrates. NADK
activity was resistant to heat treatment, had an optimum pH of 7-8, and
required divalent cations. NADK displayed a preference for zinc and
manganese ions over magnesium ions, while copper and nickel ions had no
effect on enzyme activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lerner et al. (2001) determined that the NADK gene contains 11 exons
spanning 14 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lerner et al. (2001) mapped the NADK gene
to chromosome 1p36.33-p36.21.

610292	TITLE *610292 B-CELL SCAFFOLD PROTEIN WITH ANKYRIN REPEATS 1; BANK1
;;FLJ20706;;
BANK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BANK1 is a B-cell-specific scaffold protein and LYN (165120) tyrosine
kinase substrate that promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (see ITPR1; 147265) (Yokoyama et al.,
2002).

CLONING

By solid-phase phosphorylation screening, followed by database analysis
and PCR of RNA isolated from Daudi B cells, Yokoyama et al. (2002)
cloned BANK1, which they called BANK. The deduced 755-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of 85.5 kD. BANK1 shares amino acid
homology with mouse Bcap (PIK3AP1; 607942) especially over the ankyrin
repeat motifs and predicted coiled-coil regions. BANK1 contains 23
tyrosine residues that may be phosphorylated including several potential
SH2 domain binding sites. By Northern blot analysis, a 3.2-kb transcript
was detected in mouse spleen and human Daudi B cell line, but not in T
cells or myeloid cells. By RT-PCR analysis of various B and T lineage
cells, Yokoyama et al. (2002) showed that BANK1 expression was confined
to functional B-cell antigen receptor (BCR)-expressing B cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis and spectrophotometry, Yokoyama et al.
(2002) showed that BANK1 underwent receptor-dependent tyrosine
phosphorylation and that BANK1 activation enhanced BCR-induced calcium
mobilization from intracellular calcium stores. By coimmunoprecipitation
analysis of BANK1 and LYN mutants, Yokoyama et al. (2002) demonstrated
that BANK1 residues 367-653 were required for association with LYN and
tyrosine phosphorylation of BANK1. BANK1 amino acids 1-367 interacted
with ITPR2 (600144). By interaction and phosphorylation analyses of
coexpression of BANK1, LYN, and ITPR2 and various mutants, Yokoyama et
al. (2002) concluded that BANK1 promotes LYN-mediated tyrosine
phosphorylation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors.

MAPPING

By database sequence analysis, Yokoyama et al. (2002) mapped the BANK1
gene to chromosome 4q22-q24.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700) is a prototypic autoimmune
disease characterized by production of autoantibodies and complex
genetic inheritance. In a genomewide association scan of SLE using
85,042 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), Kozyrev et al. (2008)
identified an association between SLE and a nonsynonymous substitution,
dbSNP rs10516487 (R61H; 610292.0001) in the BANK1 gene. They replicated
the association for independent case-control sets. In an analysis of
BANK1 cDNA, they found 2 isoforms, 1 full-length and the other
alternatively spliced and lacking exon 2, encoding a protein without a
putative domain for binding of IP3R (147265). The transcripts were
differentially expressed depending on a branch point-site SNP, dbSNP
rs17266594, in strong linkage disequilibrium with dbSNP rs10516487. A
third associated variant was found in the ankyrin domain (dbSNP
rs3733197). These findings implicated BANK1 as a susceptibility gene for
SLE, with variants affecting regulatory sites and key functional
domains. The disease-associated variants could contribute to sustained B
cell receptor signaling and B cell hyperactivity characteristic of SLE.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using flow cytometry, Aiba et al. (2006) showed that Bank was expressed
in most mouse B-cell subpopulations, but that Bank expression was
decreased in germinal center (GC) B cells. Aiba et al. (2006) generated
Bank-deficient mice and found that Bank was dispensable for most aspects
of B-cell development. However, Bank-deficient mice had higher levels of
mature B cells and spontaneous GC B cells, particularly in response to
T-dependent antigens, as well as higher serum IgG2a. Bank-deficient B
cells had an enhanced proliferative response to Cd40 (109535). Augmented
GC formation and IgM secretion in response to T-dependent antigen
immunization were abolished in mice lacking both Cd40 and Bank. Western
blot analysis revealed enhanced Cd40-mediated Akt (164730) activation in
Bank-deficient B cells. Aiba et al. (2006) concluded that BANK modulates
hyperactive B-cell responses by inhibiting AKT activation in
CD40-mediated pathways.

Kozyrev et al. (2008) identified an association between systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE; 152700) and a nonsynonymous substitution, dbSNP

that results in substitution of his for arg at codon 61, with the G

614555	TITLE *614555 FERM DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 6; FRMD6
;;WILLIN;;
CHROMOSOME 14 OPEN READING FRAME 31; C14ORF31
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteins containing a 4.1 (see 130500)-ezrin (VIL2; 123900)-radixin
(RDX; 179410)-moesin (MSN; 309845) (FERM) domain, such as FRMD6, are
frequently involved in maintaining the cytoskeleton (Gunn-Moore et al.,
2005).

CLONING

By searching databases for orthologs of a rat protein that interacted
with neurofascin (609145), Gunn-Moore et al. (2005) identified human
FRMD6, which they called Willin after William Dick, founder of the Royal
(Dick) School Veterinary College, University of Edinburgh. The deduced
614-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular mass of 71 kD and
contains an N-terminal FERM domain. The rat and human proteins share 91%
identity. Database analysis revealed Willin expression in human brain,
heart, liver, prostate, and lung. Northern blot analysis detected rat
Willin in sciatic nerve, but not in brain. Immunohistochemical staining
of normal human oral mucosa and squamous cell carcinoma and expression
of fluorescence-tagged Willin in mammalian cell lines showed that Willin
could exist in both the plasma membrane and cytoplasm, in either a
punctate distribution or in a perinuclear location. Willin accumulated
at points of cell contact in both HEK293 and rat PC12 pheochromocytoma
cells and at cleavage furrows of dividing HEK293 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Gunn-Moore et al. (2005) found that epitope-tagged Willin bound the same
phospholipids as moesin, namely phosphoinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P),
PI(4)P, and PI(5)P, but not PI(3,4)P2 or other phospholipids tested.
Willin relocalized from the cytoplasm to the membrane in rat PC12 cells
following treatment with EGF (131530) or NGF (see 162030), but this
redistribution of Willin was not seen in transfected HEK293 or COS-7
cells. Inhibitor studies showed that growth factor-dependent
redistribution of Willin in PC12 cells was not dependent upon PI3 kinase
(see 601232) activity or actin.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the FRMD6 gene to chromosome 14q22.1 based on an
alignment of the FRMD6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK055545) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

608127	TITLE *608127 PRE-B-CELL LEUKEMIA TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 4; PBX4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, RT-PCR, and 3-prime RACE, Wagner et al. (2001)
cloned human and mouse PBX4. The deduced human and mouse proteins
contain 374 and 378 amino acids, respectively. RT-PCR and Northern blot
analyses of mouse tissues showed almost exclusive expression in testis.
Pbx4 was expressed in mouse prepubertal testis at around postnatal day
14, when the first spermatocytes had reached the pachytene stage of the
meiotic prophase. In situ hybridization of adult mouse testis detected
expression in all tubules in a ring of cells several layers thick in a
region corresponding to meiotic spermatocytes. Immunostaining detected
Pbx4 within the XY bodies of pachytene spermatocytes. RT-PCR detected
PBX4 expression in most human tumor cell lines examined.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wagner et al. (2001) mapped the PBX4 gene
to chromosome 19p12. Using FISH, they mapped the mouse Pbx4 gene to
chromosome 8C proximal, in a region that shows homology of synteny to
human chromosome 19p13-p12.

608310	TITLE *608310 ARGININOSUCCINATE LYASE; ASL
;;ARGININOSUCCINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ASL gene encodes the subunit of argininosuccinate lyase (EC 4.3.2.1)
is a urea cycle enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of argininosuccinate
to fumarate and arginine, an essential step in the process of
detoxification of ammonia via the urea cycle (O'Brien et al., 1986).

CLONING

Using antibodies specific for argininosuccinate lyase to screen a human
liver cDNA library, O'Brien et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA corresponding
to the human ASL gene. The cDNA encodes a deduced protein of 463 amino
acids with a predicted molecular mass of 52 kD, and the active enzyme is
a homotetramer. The amino acid sequence of the human enzyme shows 56%
homology to the yeast enzyme. Matuo et al. (1988) isolated clones of
human ASL cDNA and determined the nucleotide sequence. They corrected
some minor errors in the sequence reported by O'Brien et al. (1986).

Abramson et al. (1991) found that the DNA sequences encoded by exon 7
were deleted in approximately 5 to 10% of the mature mRNA in all tissue
sources examined, suggesting alternative splicing. Walker et al. (1990)
presented evidence for an alternatively spliced ASL transcript in which
exon 2 is removed.

GENE STRUCTURE

Abramson et al. (1991) demonstrated that the ASL gene contains 16 exons.
The exon structure of the gene is identical to that of the rat and
similar to that of the delta-crystallin genes in the chicken.

Linnebank et al. (2002) completed the structure and sequence of the ASL
gene and determined that it has 17 exons. The first, exon zero (0),
codes only for the 5-untranslated region.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhao et al. (2010) showed that lysine acetylation is a prevalent
modification in enzymes that catalyze intermediate metabolism in the
human liver. Virtually every enzyme in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the urea cycle, fatty acid metabolism,
and glycogen metabolism was found to be acetylated in human liver
tissue. The concentration of metabolic fuels, such as glucose, amino
acids, and fatty acids, influenced the acetylation status of metabolic
enzymes. Acetylation activated enoyl-coenzyme A
hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (607037) in fatty acid
oxidation and malate dehydrogenase (see 154200) in the TCA cycle,
inhibited argininosuccinate lyase in the urea cycle, and destabilized
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (261680) in gluconeogenesis. Zhao et
al. (2010) concluded that acetylation plays a major role in metabolic
regulation.

MAPPING

Naylor et al. (1978) assigned the gene for ASL to chromosome 7. By
analysis of genomic DNA from hamster-human cell hybrids, O'Brien et al.
(1986) assigned the ASL gene to chromosome 7. By in situ hybridization,
Todd et al. (1989) mapped ASL to 7cen-q11.2.

- Pseudogene

O'Brien et al. (1986) found that the 5-prime end of the ASL cDNA was
also hybridized to a site on chromosome 22, which the authors assumed to
be a pseudogene. Todd et al. (1989) also detected a sequence on
chromosome 22.

Linnebank et al. (2002) identified a complete ASL homolog on chromosome
22q11.2 and stated that this so-called pseudogene is a regular gene with
a promoter region, a poly-A signal, and 11 exons containing a typical
initial exon and a terminal exon. The predicted coding sequence of the
pseudogene shared more than 0.4 kb high homology with ASL cDNA. A
GenBank search with a predicted cDNA revealed that the pseudogene might
encode immunoglobulin-lambda-like mRNA (IGLL1; 146770).

Trevisson et al. (2007) identified a second ASL pseudogene located on
chromosome 7 about 3 Mb upstream of the ASL gene, close to the
centromere. There was no evidence of expression of this second
pseudogene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In fibroblasts from a patient with ASL deficiency (207900) whose parents
were consanguineous, Walker et al. (1990) identified a homozygous
mutation in the ASL gene (608310.00001).

In 27 unrelated patients with ASL deficiency, Linnebank et al. (2002)
identified 23 different mutations, 19 novel, in the ASL gene. Fifteen of
the 54 alleles had an IVS5+1G-A splice site mutation (608310.0003).

In 5 patients with a biochemical variant of ASL deficiency in which
there was residual enzyme activity and mild clinical symptoms, Kleijer
et al. (2002) identified several mutations in the ASL gene. R385C
(608310.0004), V178M (608310.0005), and R379C (608310.0006) were
detected in homozygous states, whereas 1 patient was compound
heterozygous for 2 known mutations, including Q286R (608310.0002).
Prenatal diagnosis was successfully performed in 3 of the families.

Trevisson et al. (2007) identified 16 different mutations in the ASL
gene, including 14 novel mutations, in 12 Italian patients from 10
families with ASL deficiency. All patients tested, except 1, had less
than 5% residual enzyme activity. Mutations were scattered throughout
the gene, but there were no genotype/phenotype correlations.

EVOLUTION

Piatigorsky et al. (1988) demonstrated an extraordinary similarity
between the structural protein delta-crystallin of the lens of the duck
and the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase. Delta-crystallin is the dominant
crystallin in the lenses of birds and reptiles, but is absent from
lenses of mammals. It appears that birds, being uricotelic, have
relatively little use for the metabolic enzyme but use the protein as a
structural element by producing very large amounts. Southern blot
hybridization experiments with chicken delta-crystallin cDNA and human
ASL cDNA, coupled with enzymatic tests, provided strong evidence that
the crystallin and the enzyme share genes in an unusual evolutionary
strategy. 'Gene sharing' was the designation given this phenomenon,
i.e., when 2 distinct protein phenotypes are produced by the same
transcriptional unit. Once an enzyme has been recruited to serve as a
structural protein in lens, in addition to its conserved role in
metabolism, it is subject to at least 2 independent sets of evolutionary
pressure. This may lead to sequence modifications that enhance its
function as a crystallin, or gene duplication may take place with
subsequent partial separation of function (Piatigorsky and Wistow,
1991).

ANIMAL MODEL

Erez et al. (2011) created a hypomorphic mouse model of ASL deficiency
and showed that this mouse has a distinct phenotype of multiorgan
dysfunction and nitric oxide deficiency. Administration of nitrite,
which can be converted into nitric oxide in vivo, rescued the
manifestations of nitric oxide deficiency in hypomorphic Asl mice, and a
nitric oxide synthase-independent nitric oxide donor restored nitric
oxide-dependent vascular reactivity in humans with ASL deficiency.
Mechanistic studies showed that ASL has a structural function in
addition to the catalytic activity, by which it contributes to the
formation of a multiprotein complex required for nitric oxide
production. Erez et al. (2011) concluded their data demonstrated an
unappreciated role for ASL in nitric oxide synthase function and nitric
oxide homeostasis.

Nagamani et al. (2012) performed liver-directed gene therapy in a mouse
model of argininosuccinic aciduria (ASA) to distinguish the relative
contributions of the hepatic urea cycle defect from those of the nitric
oxide deficiency in the ASA phenotype. Whereas the gene therapy
corrected the ureagenesis defect, the systemic hypertension in mice
could be corrected by treatment with an exogenous NO source.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ARGININOSUCCINIC ACIDURIA
ASL, ARG95CYS

In fibroblasts from a patient with late-onset ASL deficiency (207900)
who was the product of a consanguineous mating, Walker et al. (1990)
identified a homozygous 283C-T change in exon 3 of the ASL gene,
resulting in an arg95-to-cys (R95C) substitution within a 13-residue
stretch that is identical in yeast and human ASL. Enzyme activity of the
mutant protein was about 1%.

.0002
ARGININOSUCCINIC ACIDURIA
ASL, GLN286ARG

In a cell line from a patient with neonatal-onset of argininosuccinic
aciduria (207900) whose parents were consanguineous, Walker et al.
(1990) identified an 857A-G transition in exon 11 of the ASL gene,
resulting in a gln286-to-arg (Q286R) substitution. The mutation occurred
in a region of 18 amino acids identical in yeast and human ASL, and in a
region of 10 amino acids highly conserved in the family of class II
fumarases. The mutant enzyme retained less than 3% of residual ASL
activity.

.0003
ARGININOSUCCINIC ACIDURIA
ASL, IVS5, G-A, +1

Linnebank et al. (2002) found that 15 of 54 ASL deficiency
(207900)-related alleles had an IVS5+1G-A splice site mutation that
resulted in the deletion of 21 amino acids.

.0004
ARGININOSUCCINIC ACIDURIA

In 2 patients from a family with variable age of onset of ASL deficiency
(207900) and considerable residual ASL activity, Kleijer et al. (2002)
identified a homozygous 1153C-T transition, resulting in an
arg385-to-cys (R385C) substitution.

.0005
ARGININOSUCCINIC ACIDURIA
ASL, VAL178MET

In a patient from a family with variable age of onset of ASL deficiency
(207900) and considerable residual ASL activity, Kleijer et al. (2002)
identified a homozygous 532G-A transition in the ASL gene, resulting in
a val178-to-met (V178M) substitution.

.0006
ARGININOSUCCINIC ACIDURIA
ASL, ARG379CYS

In a patient from a family with variable age of onset of ASL deficiency
(207900) and considerable residual ASL activity, Kleijer et al. (2002)
identified a homozygous 1135C-T transition in the ASL gene, resulting in
an arg379-to-cys (R379C) substitution.

;;OTU DOMAIN-CONTAINING UBAL-BINDING PROTEIN 1;;
OTUBAIN 1; OTU1; OTB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Otubains, such as OTB1, are deubiquitylating cysteine proteases (DUBs;
see 602519) that belong to the ovarian tumor (OTU) protein superfamily.
Like other DUBs, otubains cleave proteins precisely at the ubiquitin
(UB; see 191339)-protein bond (Balakirev et al., 2003).

CLONING

By affinity purification of DUBs from HeLa cells using UB aldehyde
(UBAL), followed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrophotometric analysis,
Balakirev et al. (2003) obtained cDNAs encoding OTB1 and OTB2 (608338).
The 271-amino acid, 31-kD OTB1 protein contains UB-interaction motifs
(UIMs) and UB-associated (UBA) domains, as well as putative nuclear
localization signals and a consensus LxxLL motif. RT-PCR and Western
blot analyses revealed wide expression of OTB1, with 2 isoforms in
leukocytes.

By PCR and immunoblot analysis, Soares et al. (2004) identified an
815-bp OTB1 isoform, which was expressed ubiquitously, and a 950-bp
isoform, which was expressed only in lymphoid tissue. The 815-bp isoform
encodes the 31-kD protein reported by Balakirev et al. (2003), whereas
the 950-bp isoform encodes a 35-kD, 315-amino acid protein, OTB1ARF1
(OTB1 alternative reading frame-1), that lacks the asp and cys residues
in the OTU cysteine proteinase catalytic core and retains only the
C-terminal flanking region of the OTU domain. The OTB1ARF1 transcript is
produced from the same transcription start site as OTB1 but uses an AUG
codon located in exon 2 and in a different reading frame from that of
OTB1. In addition, there is no splicing between exons 4 and 5 in
OTB1ARF1, which causes a frameshift back to the same reading frame as
OTB1.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Soares et al. (2004) showed that GRAIL
(RNF128; 300439) binds to OTB1. Although OTB1 was found to have DUB
activity, it failed to deubiquitinate polyubiquitinated GRAIL.
Immunoprecipitation and coexpression analysis indicated that OTB1, but
not OTB1ARF1, binds to the C-terminal UCH catalytic domain of USP8
(603158) in a trimolecular complex with GRAIL. Soares et al. (2004)
studied cells from T-cell receptor-transgenic mice expressing the
alternative forms of OTB1. OTB1-expressing cells contained negligible
amounts of Grail, proliferated well, and produced large amounts of
interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) after antigenic stimulation. In contrast,
cells expressing OTB1ARF1 contained large amounts of Grail and were
functionally anergic, proliferating poorly and not producing Il2. Soares
et al. (2004) concluded that the balance of OTB1 and OTB1ARF1 in T cells
is an important factor that regulates GRAIL stability and the outcome of
immune responses in secondary lymphoid organs.

Nakada et al. (2010) reported that OTUB1, a deubiquitinating enzyme, is
an inhibitor of double stranded break induced chromatin ubiquitination.
Surprisingly, they found that OTUB1 suppresses RNF168 (612688)-dependent
polyubiquitination independently of its catalytic activity. OTUB1 does
so by binding to and inhibiting UBC13 (UBE2N; 603679), the cognate E2
enzyme for RNF168. Nakada et al. (2010) suggested that this unusual mode
of regulation is unlikely to be limited to UBC13 because analysis of
OTUB1-associated proteins revealed that OTUB1 binds to E2s of the UBE2D
and UBE2E subfamilies. Finally, OTUB1 depletion mitigates the
double-stranded break repair defect associated with defective ATM
(607585) signaling, indicating that pharmacologic targeting of the
OTUB1-UBC13 interaction might enhance the DNA damage response.

Using immunoblot analysis, Lin et al. (2009) demonstrated expression of
GRAIL in naive mouse and human CD4 (186940) T lymphocytes. They found
that, upon CD4 T-cell activation, OTUB1 was expressed and GRAIL was
degraded, allowing proliferation to proceed. Preventing OTUB1 expression
with CTLA4 (123890)-Ig, anti-IL2, or rapamycin, all of which target MTOR
(FRAP1; 601231), resulted in maintenance of GRAIL and inhibition of CD4
T-cell proliferation. Lin et al. (2009) concluded that a pathway
sequentially links CD28 (186760) costimulation, IL2 expression, IL2R
(IL2RA; 147730) signaling, and MTOR activation as important requirements
for naive CD4 T-cell proliferation through the regulation of OTUB1 and
GRAIL expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Soares et al. (2004) determined that the OTB1 gene contains 7 exons.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Wiener et al. (2012) described structural and biochemical studies
elucidating how OTUB1 inhibits UBC13 and other E2 enzymes. They
unexpectedly found that OTUB1 binding to UBC13-Ub (the ubiquitin
thiolester) is allosterically regulated by free ubiquitin, which binds
to a second site in OTUB1 and increases its affinity for UBC13-Ub, while
at the same time disrupting interactions with UEV1A (602995) in a manner
that depends on the OTUB1 N terminus. Crystal structures of an
OTUB1-UBC13 complex and of OTUB1 bound to ubiquitin aldehyde and a
chemical UBC13-Ub conjugate showed that binding of free ubiquitin to
OTUB1 triggers conformational changes in the OTU domain and formation of
a ubiquitin-binding helix in the N terminus, thus promoting binding of
the conjugated donor ubiquitin in UBC13-Ub to OTUB1. The donor ubiquitin
thus cannot interact with the E2 enzyme, which has been shown to be
important for ubiquitin transfer. The N-terminal helix of OTUB1 is
positioned to interfere with UEV1A binding to UBC13, as well as with
attack on the thiolester by an acceptor ubiquitin, thereby inhibiting
K63Ub synthesis. OTUB1 binding also occludes the RING E3 binding site on
UBC13, thus providing a further component of inhibition. Wiener et al.
(2012) concluded that the general features of the inhibition mechanism
explained how OTUB1 inhibits other E2 enzymes in a noncatalytic manner.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Balakirev et al. (2003) mapped the OTUB1
gene to chromosome 11q13.1.

612092	TITLE *612092 MICRO RNA 200C; MIR200C
;;miRNA200C;;
MIRN200C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIRN200C, are 20- to 22-nucleotide noncoding
RNAs that inhibit gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by
binding to complementary sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of target mRNAs
(Park et al., 2008).

CLONING

Park et al. (2008) stated that miR200C belongs to the miR200 family of
miRNAs, which can be divided into 2 subfamilies based on a 1-nucleotide
difference in seed sequences. miR200A (612090) and miR141 (612093) have
a seed sequence of AACACUG, whereas miR200B (612091), miR200C, and
miR429 (612094) have a seed sequence of AAUACUG.

GENE FUNCTION

Park et al. (2008) evaluated expression of 207 miRNAs in 60 human cell
lines and found that expression of miR200 family members, including
miR200C, was associated with an epithelial phenotype. Expression of
these miRNAs showed a positive correlation with expression of E-cadherin
(CDH1; 192090), an epithelial cell marker, and a negative correlation
with expression of vimentin (VIM; 193060), a mesenchymal cell marker.
Park et al. (2008) identified multiple miR200 target sequences in the
3-prime UTRs of the E-cadherin transcriptional repressors ZEB1 (189909)
and ZEB2 (605802). Using the 3-prime UTRs of mouse and human ZEB1 and
ZEB2, they showed that endogenous miR200s suppressed ZEB1 and ZEB2
expression. Increasing the levels of miR200A and miR200C induced
mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in human cancer cell lines,
reducing their aggressiveness. Conversely, reducing miR200 levels
induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Park et al. (2008)
concluded that the miR200 family regulates EMT/MET by targeting ZEB1 and
ZEB2, which control expression of E-cadherin.

Using the MDCK canine epithelial cell line and a subclone with a
mesenchymal phenotype, Gregory et al. (2008) independently showed that
the miR200 family, including miR141, and miR205 (613147) regulated
expression of Zeb1 and Zeb2 and controlled EMT. Furthermore, expression
of the miR200 family and miR205 was lost in invasive human breast cancer
cell lines with mesenchymal phenotype and in primary breast cancer
specimens lacking E-cadherin.

Shimono et al. (2009) showed that MIR200C downregulated expression of
BMI1 (164831), a regulator of stem cell self-renewal. Expression of
MIR200C resulted in growth retardation and differentiation in Tera-2
cells, suppressed clonogenicity in mouse breast cancer cells, reduced
tumorigenicity of human breast cancer stem cells in immunocompromised
mice, and suppressed mammary outgrowth from normal mouse mammary stem
cells in vivo. Shimono et al. (2009) concluded that MIR200C provides a
molecular link between normal and cancerous stem cells.

MAPPING

Park et al. (2008) stated that the miR200 family members MIRN200C and
MIRN141 are clustered on chromosome 12, whereas MIRN200A, MIRN200B, and
MIRN429 are clustered on chromosome 1.

607931	TITLE *607931 ATAXIN 2-LIKE; ATXN2L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATXN2L associates with the thrombopoietin (TPO; 600044) receptor, MPL
(159530), and is a component of a cytokine signaling cascade following
receptor activation (Meunier et al., 2002).

CLONING

Using the cytoplasmic domain of MPL as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen,
Meunier et al. (2002) isolated a partial clone of ATXN2L from a
megakaryoblast cell line cDNA library. They obtained the full-length
cDNA by probing a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library. The deduced protein
contains 1,076 amino acids. Meunier et al. (2002) identified 3 putative
initiation sites and several variants that differ in their C termini.
ATXN2L contains 3 domains that share significant homology with ataxin-2
(601517). The N terminus of ATXN2L has 8 interrupted glutamines
replacing the polyglutamine tract of ataxin-2. Northern blot analysis
detected major ATXN2L transcripts at 4.0 and 4.5 kb expressed at high
levels in thymus, lymph node, spleen, fetal kidney, and adult testis.
ATXN2L was also expressed in several other hematopoietic and fetal
tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Meunier et al. (2002) showed that endogenous ATXN2L was associated with
MPL in a hematopoietic cell line and that ATXN2L interacted specifically
with a 24-amino acid C-terminal segment of the receptor. Thrombopoietin
caused the release of ATXN2L from the activated receptor, and the
phosphorylation of ATXN2L on tyrosine residues by TPO was dependent on
the 24-amino acid C-terminal domain of MPL. ATXN2L also bound to the
unstimulated erythropoietin receptor (133171), and erythropoietin
(133170) caused its dissociation. Meunier et al. (2002) concluded that
ATXN2L is a novel component of the cytokine signaling system.

MAPPING

By FISH, Meunier et al. (2002) mapped the ATXN2L gene to chromosome
16p11 and an ATXN2L pseudogene to chromosome 7p21.

613117	TITLE *613117 SMALL NUCLEOLAR RNA, C/D BOX, 50A; SNORD50A
;;RNA, U50 SMALL NUCLEOLAR; RNU50;;
snoRNA, U50
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNORD50A belongs to the C/D box class of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs),
which are thought to function as guide RNAs in the site-specific ribose
methylation of preribosomal RNA (Kiss-Laszlo et al., 1996).

CLONING

Kiss-Laszlo et al. (1996) isolated SNORD50A, which they called RNU50,
from a cDNA library of intronic snoRNAs from HeLa cells. RNU50 is 74
nucleotides long.

GENE FUNCTION

Kiss-Laszlo et al. (1996) found that a 15-nucleotide sequence of RNU50
was complementary to a region near the D box of 28S ribosomal RNA (see
180450), and that a 12-nucleotide sequence of RNU50 was complementary to
a region near the D-prime box of 28S RNA. These regions of 28S RNA
contain an O-methylcytosine and a potential O-methylguanine,
respectively. Kiss-Laszlo et al. (1996) hypothesized that RNU50 may have
a role in methylation of 28S RNA at these sites.

Using Northern blot analysis and real-time PCR, Dong et al. (2008)
showed that expression of snoRNA U50 was downregulated in a significant
number of primary prostate cancer specimens and prostate cancer cell
lines. Ectopic expression of snoRNA U50 significantly reduced colony
formation in the 2 prostate cancer cell lines examined.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tanaka et al. (2000) determined that the
SNORD50A gene lies within intron 5 of the SNHG5 gene (613263) on
chromosome 6q15.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Dong et al. (2008) identified a homozygous 2-bp (TT) germline deletion
in the SNORD50A gene in 2 (2%) of 89 unrelated patients with prostate
cancer but not in 104 men without prostate cancer. A somatic homozygous
TT deletion was found 2 of 30 prostate cancer cell lines or xenografts,
and 9 of 89 localized prostate cancers (total, 11 (9%) of 119 cancers).
The homozygous deletion abolished U50 suppressive function in a colony
formation assay, suggesting that SNORD50A is a tumor suppressor gene and
that germline mutation may increase susceptibility to prostate cancer.
Further analysis of 1,371 prostate cancer patients and 1,371 matched
controls showed that a heterozygous germline TT deletion was found at
similar levels in patients and controls, suggesting that it may be a
common polymorphism.

;;ACTIVIN A RECEPTOR, TYPE II-LIKE KINASE 3; ACVRLK3;;
ACTIVIN RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 3; ALK3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

See ACVRL1 (601284). Human cDNA clones encoding 4 putative transmembrane
ser/thr kinases were identified by ten Dijke et al. (1993). Using
degenerate DNA primers based on the human activin receptor type II (see
102581) and C. elegans Daf-1 gene products, they PCR-amplified mRNA from
human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells, a cell type known to respond both to
activin (147290) and TGF-beta (190180). The ALK3 gene encodes a
532-amino acid polypeptide that shares similar sequence and domain
structures with the other 3 ALK genes they cloned. ALK1, ALK2 (102576),
ALK3, and ALK4 (601300) share approximately 40% sequence identity with
activin receptors type II and IIB, TGF-beta receptor (see 190181), and
Daf-1 in their kinase domains but share 60 to 79% sequence identity
among themselves, suggesting to ten Dijke et al. (1993) that the ALK
gene products form a subfamily of receptor ser/thr kinases. By Northern
analysis, ten Dijke et al. (1993) showed that ALK3 was expressed almost
exclusively in human skeletal muscle with weak expression in heart and
placenta.

GENE FUNCTION

Eng (2001) pointed out that the TGF-beta/BMP superfamily of molecules
has been shown to be defective not only in neoplasia but also in the
noncancer developmental syndromes primary pulmonary hypertension
(178600) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1, 187300; HHT2,
600376).

Elimination of the developing female reproductive tract in male fetuses
is an essential step in mammalian sexual differentiation. In males, the
fetal testis produces anti-mullerian hormone (AMH; 600957), which causes
regression of the mullerian ducts, the primordia of the oviducts,
uterus, and upper vagina. AMH induces regression by binding to a
specific type II receptor (AMHR2; 600956). Mutations in AMH or AMHR2 in
humans and mice disrupt signaling, producing male pseudohermaphrodites
that possess oviducts and uteri. Jamin et al. (2002) showed that
targeted disruption of the BMPR1A receptor protein in the mesenchymal
cells of the mullerian ducts leads to retention of oviducts and uteri in
males. These results identified BMPR1A as a type I receptor for
AMH-induced regression of mullerian ducts. Because BMPR1A is
evolutionarily conserved, these findings indicate that a component of
the bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway has been co-opted
during evolution for male sexual development in amniotes.

In humans, mutations in the BMPR1A, SMAD4 (600993), and PTEN (601728)
genes are responsible for juvenile polyposis syndrome, juvenile
intestinal polyposis, and Cowden disease (CD; 158350), respectively. The
development of polyposis is a common feature of these disorders,
suggesting that there is an association between the BMP and PTEN
pathways. To determine the mechanistic link between the 2 pathways and
the related etiology of juvenile polyposis, He et al. (2004) generated
mice in which Bmpr1a was conditionally inactivated; the conditional
inactivation disturbed homeostasis of intestinal epithelial regeneration
with an expansion of the stem and progenitor cell populations,
eventually leading to intestinal polyposis resembling human juvenile
polyposis syndrome. He et al. (2004) showed that BMP signaling
suppresses Wnt signaling to ensure a balanced control stem cell
self-renewal. Mechanistically, PTEN, through phosphatidylinositol-3
kinase/Akt, mediates the convergence of the BMP and Wnt pathways on
control of beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806). The authors concluded that BMP
signaling may control the duplication of intestinal stem cells, thereby
preventing crypt fission and the subsequent increase in crypt number.

Waite and Eng (2003) searched for a link between PTEN and BMP signaling.
They found that exposure to BMP2 (112261) increased PTEN protein levels
in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. The increase in PTEN protein was
rapid and was not due to an increase in new protein synthesis,
suggesting that BMP2 stimulation inhibited PTEN protein degradation.
BMP2 treatment of MCF-7 cells decreased the association of PTEN with 2
proteins in the degradative pathway, UBE2L3 (603721) and UBE2E3
(604151). Waite and Eng (2003) suggested that BMP2 exposure may regulate
PTEN protein levels by decreasing PTEN's association with the
degradative pathway, which may explain how BMPR1A may act as a minor
susceptibility gene for PTEN-mutation-negative Cowden syndrome.

In studies of lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients with
fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP; 135100) and controls, de la
Pena et al. (2005) found that FOP lymphocytes expressed 6-fold higher
levels of BMPR1A on the cell surface compared with control cells and
displayed a marked reduction in ligand-stimulated internalization and
degradation of BMPR1A. In control cells, BMP4 (112262) treatment
increased BMPR1A phosphorylation; in FOP cells, BMPR1A was
phosphorylated at a high level in the absence of the ligand and showed
no increase in response to BMP4. After treatment with the BMP antagonist
noggin (602991), BMPR1A phosphorylation decreased in control cells but
remained constant in FOP cells, indicating that BMPR1A
hyperphosphorylation is independent of ligand stimulation in FOP cells.
De la Pena et al. (2005) concluded that altered BMP receptor trafficking
may play a significant role in FOP pathogenesis.

Using RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometric analyses, Cejalvo
et al. (2007) demonstrated that human thymus and cortical epithelial
cells produced BMP2 and BMP4 and that both thymocytes and thymic
epithelium expressed the molecular machinery to respond to these
proteins. The receptors BMPR1A and BMPR2 (600799) were mainly expressed
by cortical thymocytes, whereas BMPR1B (603248) was expressed in the
majority of thymocytes. BMP4 treatment of chimeric human-mouse fetal
thymic organ cultures seeded with CD34 (142230)-positive human thymic
progenitors resulted in reduced cell recovery and inhibition of
differentiation of CD4 (186940)/CD8 (see 186910) double-negative to
double-positive stages. Cejalvo et al. (2007) concluded that BMP2 and
BMP4 have a role in human T-cell differentiation.

MAPPING

Ide et al. (1998) used fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation
hybrid mapping to localize the BMPR1A gene to human chromosome 10q22.3.
By analysis of a monochromosome hybrid mapping panel and by FISH, Astrom
et al. (1999) mapped the BMPR1A gene to chromosome 10q23. They
identified a related intronless sequence on chromosome 6q23. Astrom et
al. (1999) stated that the mouse Bmpr1a gene maps to a region of
chromosome 14 that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 10.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Juvenile polyposis (174900) is an autosomal dominant gastrointestinal
hamartomatous polyposis syndrome in which patients are at risk for
developing gastrointestinal cancers. The affected members in some
families with juvenile polyposis showed germline mutations in the MADH4
gene (SMAD4; 600993), and mutations in the PTEN gene (601728) have been
described in a few families. In an attempt to define the remaining
genetic heterogeneity, Howe et al. (2001) used a genomewide screen in 4
juvenile polyposis kindreds without germline mutations in either MADH4
or PTEN and identified linkage with markers from chromosome 10q22-q23
(maximum lod score = 4.74 at theta = 0.00). They found no recombinants
using markers developed from the vicinity of the BMPR1A gene. Genomic
sequencing of BMPR1A in each of these juvenile polyposis kindreds
disclosed germline nonsense mutations in all affected kindred members
but not in normal individuals. These findings indicated involvement of
an additional gene in the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily in
the genesis of juvenile polyposis, and documented an unanticipated
function for bone morphogenetic protein in colonic epithelial growth
control.

Friedl et al. (2002) examined 29 patients with the clinical diagnosis of
juvenile polyposis for germline mutations in the MADH4 or BMPR1A genes
and identified MADH4 mutations in 7 (24%) and BMPR1A mutations in 5
patients (17%). A remarkable prevalence of massive gastric polyposis was
observed in patients with MADH4 mutations when compared with patients
with BMPR1A mutations or without identified mutations. This, they
claimed, was the first genotype-phenotype correlation observed in
juvenile polyposis.

Zhou et al. (2001) searched for germline mutations in BMPR1A in a series
of familial and isolated European probands with juvenile polyposis
syndrome and without germline mutations of MADH4. Ten of 25 (40%)
probands were found to have germline BMPR1A mutations, 8 of which
resulted in truncated receptors and 2 of which resulted in missense
alterations: cys124 to arg (C124R; 601299.0006) and cys376 to tyr
(C376Y; 601299.0007). Almost all available component tumors from
mutation-positive cases showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the
BMPR1A region, whereas those from mutation-negative cases did not. Zhou
et al. (2001) concluded that germline BMPR1A mutations cause a
significant proportion of cases of juvenile polyposis.

Of 4 Korean patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome, Kim et al. (2003)
identified 3 mutations in the MADH4 gene and 1 in the BMPR1A gene
(601299.0008).

In 77 different familial and sporadic cases of juvenile polyposis, Howe
et al. (2004) identified germline MADH4 mutations in 14 cases (18.2%)
and BMPR1A mutations in 16 cases (20.8%). The authors noted that because
mutations were not found in more than half of the patients with juvenile
polyposis, either additional predisposing genes remain to be discovered
or alternative means of inactivation of the 2 known genes account for
these cases.

In affected members of a 3-generation Singapore Chinese family with
hereditary mixed polyposis (HMPS2; 610069), Cao et al. (2006) identified
heterozygosity for an 11-bp deletion in the BMPR1A gene (601299.0009).

Delnatte et al. (2006) described 4 unrelated children with juvenile
polyposis of infancy (see 612242). They showed that these children were
heterozygous for de novo germline deletion encompassing 2 contiguous
genes, PTEN (601728) and BMPR1A. They hypothesized that juvenile
polyposis of infancy is caused by the deletion of these 2 genes and that
the severity of the disease reflects cooperation between these tumor
suppressor genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yoon et al. (2005) found that, although mice deficient in either Bmpr1a
or Bmpr1b in cartilage form intact cartilaginous elements, double
mutants develop severe generalized chondrodysplasia.

Liu et al. (2005) demonstrated that mice with conditional inactivation
of the Bmpr1a gene in the facial primordia developed completely
penetrant, bilateral cleft lip/palate (119530) with arrested tooth
formation. The cleft secondary palate of Bmpr1a-mutant embryos was
associated with diminished cell proliferation in maxillary process
mesenchyme and defective anterior posterior patterning. In contrast, the
mutant mice showed elevated apoptosis in the fusing lip region of the
medial nasal process. Conditional inactivation of the Bmp4 gene resulted
in delayed fusion of the medial nasal process to form the lip, resulting
in isolated cleft lip in all mouse embryos at 12 days after conception.
However, cleft lip was only present in 22% of mouse embryos at 14.5 days
after conception, indicating spontaneous repair of cleft lip in utero
(see 600625). The findings implicated a BMP4-BMPR1A genetic pathway that
functions in lip fusion, and revealed that BMP signaling has distinct
roles in lip and palate fusion.

Schulz et al. (2013) generated mice lacking the Bmpr1a gene in all cells
descending from the Myf5 (159990)+ lineage, which are the cells that
generate constitutive brown adipose tissue. No apparent changes in
morphology, proliferation, or apoptosis were observed during early
embryonic stages, but there was reduced constitutive brown fat formation
starting at embryonic day 16.5. These mice were born runted and stayed
smaller throughout life, and the reduction of constitutive brown adipose
tissue mass remained highly significant in adult mice. This lack of
constitutive brown adipose tissue resulted in increased sympathetic
input to white adipose tissue, thereby promoting formation of
recruitable brown adipose tissue within white fat deposits. This
compensatory mechanism, aimed at restoring total brown fat-mediated
thermogenic capacity in the body, is sufficient to maintain normal
temperature homeostasis and resistance to diet-induced obesity. Schulz
et al. (2013) concluded that their data suggested an important
physiologic crosstalk between constitutive and recruitable brown fat
cells.

In a kindred with juvenile polyposis (174900), Howe et al. (2001) found

BMPR1A, ALA338ASP

Zhou et al. (2001) identified a patient with a germline missense
mutation, ala338 to asp (A338D), in exon 8 of BMPR1A. The proband had
only colonic polyposis, which comprised hamartomatous and adenomatous
polyps and began at the age of 16 years, and lipomas. Her family
history, however, included individuals with breast cancer, renal-cell
carcinoma, brain tumor(s), or melanoma. Taken together, these features
constituted the minimum criteria (i.e., 1 major and 3 minor) for the
diagnosis of Cowden syndrome (158350) (Eng, 2000). Zhou et al. (2001)
suggested that BMPR1A mutation may define a small subset of cases of
Cowden syndrome/Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (153480) with specific
colonic phenotype.

codon 42 in exon 2 of the BMPR1A gene, predicted to cause a frameshift
and a truncation deleting all the functional domains of BMPR1A. The
mutation was not found in any unaffected family members.

JUVENILE POLYPOSIS OF INFANCY
BMPR1A, DEL

Delnatte et al. (2006) demonstrated de novo deletion of BMPR1A and the
contiguous PTEN gene (601728) on chromosome 10q in 4 unrelated children
with juvenile polyposis of infancy (see 612242). One of the children was
a girl with extradigestive features suggesting Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba
syndrome (BRRS; 153480). She presented with macrocephaly at birth.
Severity of gastrointestinal bleeding and diarrhea led to colectomy at
age 10 months. The child died at age 3 years because of recurrent
bleeding from polyps and inanition. Because of the features of BRRS, a
search for a germline mutation of PTEN was performed. Although no
mutation was found, a large deletion of the PTEN and BMPR1A loci was
indicated by absence of paternal markers. Another of the 4 patients
presented with more than 50 juvenile polyps within the entire colon and
duodenum by age 18 months.

602351	TITLE *602351 CHEMOKINE-LIKE RECEPTOR 1; CMKLR1
;;CHEMR23;;
CHEMERIN RECEPTOR; CHEMERINR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chemokines, a family of small cytokines, recruit leukocytes during
inflammation and immune responses. Chemokine receptors, such as the
somatostatin receptors (see, e.g., 182451), belong to the family of
7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors. Gantz et al. (1996) cloned
CMKLR1 by PCR of genomic DNA with degenerate primers based on the
conserved regions of somatostatin receptors 1-4. The predicted 371-amino
acid protein has 7 hydrophobic domains. The CMKLR1 gene has over 40%
nucleotide sequence homology to the somatostatin receptors 1-4 and over
50% to IL81R (146929) and FPR1 (136537). Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of multiple transcripts of different size in all tissues
examined.

While attempting to identify new neuropeptide receptors from a
neuroblastoma x glioma cell line by RT-PCR with primers based on
conserved regions of G protein-coupled neuropeptide receptors, Methner
et al. (1997) cloned a mouse Cmklr1 cDNA, which they designated Dez.
Using in situ hybridization, Methner et al. (1997) found that Dez is
differentially regulated during mouse development, with prominent
expression in developing osseous and cartilaginous tissues. Owman et al.
(1997) cloned the rat homolog, which they designated Cmkrl3, from a
liver cDNA library. Using in situ hybridization, they found that Cmkrl3
is widely expressed in the brain and periphery, particularly in
cardiovascular elements.

Using RT-PCR analysis, Wittamer et al. (2003) detected abundant CHEMR23
expression in immature dendritic cells (DCs), spleen, lymph node, and
lung, with lower levels in most other tissues examined. FACS analysis
confirmed CHEMR23 expression on DCs and macrophages.

GENE FUNCTION

By screening a cell line expressing CHEMR23, followed by reverse-phase
HPLC and mass spectrophotometric analysis, Wittamer et al. (2003)
identified the active product of TIG2 (RARRES2; 601973), which they
called chemerin, as the CHEMR23 ligand. Chemerin induced calcium
mobilization in and migration of macrophages and immature dendritic
cells in a CHEMR23-dependent manner. Monoclonal antibodies to CHEMR23
blocked chemerin-induced calcium mobilization in CHEMR23-expressing cell
lines.

By screening cells overexpressing CHEMR23 with a hemofiltrate peptide
library, followed by chromatographic purification, Meder et al. (2003)
independently identified a 134-amino acid circulating form of TIG2 as
the CHEMR23 ligand.

By generating a monoclonal antibody to CHEMR23 and screening circulating
leukocytes by FACS analysis, Zabel et al. (2005) demonstrated expression
of CHEMR23 on circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs), but not on
myeloid DCs or other blood cells. In vitro assays identified chemerin in
serum, but not plasma, as a chemoattractant for CHEMR23-expressing
cells. Zabel et al. (2005) concluded that CHEMR23 may be a key mediator
of plasmacytoid DC recruitment from blood to tissue sites enriched in
chemerin.

By flow cytometric analysis, Vermi et al. (2005) demonstrated CHEMR23
expression in 40% of myeloid DCs and virtually all plasmacytoid DCs.
Transmigration of both DC populations across an endothelial cell layer
was dependent on chemerin and CHEMR23. Immunohistochemical analysis of
lymph nodes and tonsils showed CHEMR23 expression on DCs, but not on
Langerhans cells. Chemerin was expressed on the luminal side of high
endothelial venules. Chemerin was not expressed in normal skin, but it
was expressed on endothelial cells lining dermal blood vessels of lupus
erythematosus skin lesions in which plasmacytoid DCs were abundant.
Vermi et al. (2005) proposed that CHEMR23-chemerin interaction has a key
role in directing plasmacytoid DC traffic.

Resolvin E1 (RvE1), a bioactive oxygenated product of the essential
fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), is found in plasma during the
resolution phase of inflammation. Arita et al. (2005) determined the
complete structure of RvE1 and found that CHEMR23 mediates RvE1
signaling to attenuate NFKB (164011). Radioligand binding analysis
showed that chemerin and RvE1 bound the same region of CHEMR23. RvE1
inhibited Il12 p40 (IL12B; 161561) production induced from mouse splenic
DCs by Toxoplasma gondii antigen in a dose-dependent manner. Arita et
al. (2005) concluded that EPA, which is present in fish oils and has
beneficial effects on inflammatory disorders, and EPA-derived endogenous
agonists have antiinflammatory properties.

MAPPING

Gantz et al. (1996) mapped the CMKLR1 gene to chromosome 12q24.1 by

610284	TITLE *610284 LIPOYLTRANSFERASE 1; LIPT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In mammals, lipoyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.181) catalyzes the second of 2
steps in the covalent attachment of lipoic acid to lipoate-dependent
proteins, including the glycine cleavage system H protein (GCSH; 238330)
and the dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2) subunits of the pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex (DLAT; 608770), the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
complex (DLST; 126063), and the branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase
complex (DBT; 248610) (Fujiwara et al., 1999).

CLONING

Using a bovine lipoyltransferase cDNA fragment as probe, Fujiwara et al.
(1999) cloned human LIPT1 from a liver cDNA library. The deduced
373-amino acid precursor protein shares 88% and 31% sequence identity
with bovine lipoyltransferase II and E. coli lipoate-protein ligase A,
respectively. By alignment of LIPT1 with the bovine lipoyltransferase
amino acid sequence, Fujiwara et al. (1999) predicted that the
N-terminal 26 amino acids comprise a mitochondrial targeting sequence,
with the threonine-27 corresponding to the first residue of the mature
enzyme. Thus, the deduced mature LIPT1 enzyme contains 347 amino acids
with a calculated molecular mass of 39.539 kD. Northern blot analysis
detected a major 1.5-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in skeletal muscle and heart, followed by liver, brain,
placenta, and lung.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fujiwara et al. (1999) determined that the LIPT1 gene contains 4 exons
and spans 8 kb of genomic DNA. They found evidence of several LIPT1
transcripts resulting from alternative splicing in the 5-prime
untranslated region.

MAPPING

By FISH, Fujiwara et al. (1999) mapped the LIPT1 gene to chromosome
2q11.2.

604319	TITLE *604319 TRF1-INTERACTING NUCLEAR FACTOR 2; TINF2
;;TIN2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TINF2 is a subunit of the 6-protein shelterin/telosome complex. This
complex protects telomere ends and cooperates with telomerase (see TERT;
187270) to maintain telomeres. TINF2 plays a central role in the
assembly and function of the shelterin/telosome complex by connecting
the double-stranded DNA-binding proteins TRF1 (TERF1; 600951) and TRF2
(TERF2; 602027) to the single-stranded DNA-binding unit TPP1 (ACD;
609377)/POT1 (606478) (summary by Yang et al., 2011).

CLONING

By interaction cloning using the telomeric DNA-binding protein TRF1, Kim
et al. (1999) isolated a novel human telomere-associated protein that
they named TIN2. The TIN2 protein contains 354 amino acids. A wide
variety of human tissues and cell types expressed a 2.4-kb TIN2
transcript on Northern blot analysis, and expression did not vary with
growth state, immortalization, or transformation. TIN2 colocalized with
TRF1 in nuclei and metaphase chromosomes.

Yang et al. (2011) stated that the 354-amino acid TINF2 protein contains
an N-terminal domain of about 200 amino acids that binds the
shelterin/telosome subunits TPP1 and TRF2, followed by an approximately
20-amino acid TRF1-binding motif.

GENE FUNCTION

Kim et al. (1999) showed that TIN2 interacted with TRF1 in vitro and in
cells. Expression of a TIN2 mutant lacking N-terminal sequences resulted
in elongated human telomeres in a telomerase-dependent manner. Kim et
al. (1999) interpreted the findings as suggesting that TRF1 is
insufficient for control of telomere length in human cells and that TIN2
is an essential mediator of TRF1 function. The mutant TIN2 had the
properties of a dominant-negative mutant. The findings suggested that
wildtype TIN2 is a negative regulator of telomerase length.

Telomere length in humans is partly controlled by a feedback mechanism
in which telomere elongation by telomerase is limited by the
accumulation of the TRF1 complex at chromosome ends. TRF1 itself can be
inhibited by the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity of its
interacting partner tankyrase-1 (603303), which abolishes its DNA
binding activity in vitro and removes the TRF1 complex from telomeres in
vivo. Ye and de Lange (2004) reported that the inhibition of TRF1 by
tankyrase is in turn controlled by a second TRF1-interacting factor,
TIN2. Partial knockout of TIN2 by small hairpin RNA in a
telomerase-positive cell line resulted in telomere elongation, which is
typical of reduced TRF1 function. Transient inhibition of TIN2 with
small interfering RNA led to diminished telomeric TRF1 signals. These
and other data identified TIN2 as a PARP modulator in the TRF1 complex
and explained how TIN2 contributes to the regulation of telomere length.

Liu et al. (2004) found that TIN2 was part of a high molecular mass
protein complex in HeLa cells that mediates telomere end-capping and
length control. Other members of this complex are TRF1, TRF2, RAP1
(TERF2IP; 605061), POT1, and TPP1.

Through reconstitution and fractionation experiments, O'Connor et al.
(2006) found that TPP1 and TIN2 were essential mediators of telomeric
complex formation and that TPP1-TIN2 interaction regulated bridging of
TRF1 and TRF2. Overexpression of TPP1 enhanced TIN2-TRF1 association,
and conversely, knockdown of TPP1 reduced the ability of endogenous TRF1
to associate with the TRF2 complex. O'Connor et al. (2006) concluded
that coordinated interaction among TPP1, TIN2, TRF1, and TRF2 is
required for assembly of the telomere complex and ultimately for
telomere maintenance.

Mammalian telomeres are protected by a 6-protein complex, shelterin.
Shelterin contains 2 closely related proteins, TRF1 and TRF2, which
recruit various proteins to telomeres. Chen et al. (2008) dissected the
interactions of TRF1 and TRF2 with their shared binding partner TIN2 and
other shelterin accessory factors. TRF1 recognizes TIN2 using a
conserved molecular surface in its TRF homology domain. However, this
same surface does not act as a TIN2-binding site in TRF2, and TIN2
binding to TRF2 is mediated by a region outside the TRF homology domain.
Instead, the TRF homology domain docking site of TRF2 binds a shelterin
accessory factor, Apollo, also known as SNM1B (609683), which does not
interact with the TRF homology domain of TRF1. Conversely, the TRF
homology domain of TRF1, but not of TRF2, interacts with another
shelterin-associated factor, PINX1 (606505).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Patients with dyskeratosis congenita (DKC), a heterogeneous inherited
bone marrow failure syndrome, have abnormalities in telomere biology
including very short telomeres. Whereas germline mutations in DKC1
(300126), TERC (602322), and TERT (187270) have been found in DKC
patients, approximately 60% of DKC patients lack an identifiable
mutation. With the very short telomere phenotype and a highly penetrant,
rare disease model, Savage et al. (2008) performed a linkage scan on a
family with autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita-3 (DKCA3; 613990)
in which affected members did not have mutations in DKC1, TERC, or TERT.
Evidence favoring linkage was found at 14q11.2, which led to the
identification of the TINF2 mutations K280E (604319.0001) in the proband
and her 5 affected relatives. Three additional unrelated DKC probands,
including 1 with Revesz syndrome (268130), carried TINF2 R282H
(604319.0002). A fifth DKC proband had an R282S mutation (604319.0003).
All 3 mutations were in extremely close proximity and near the end of
the TRF1 (600951)-binding domain of the TIN2 protein. This study
provided the first example of a shelterin complex mutation linked to
human disease and confirmed the role of very short telomeres as a
diagnostic test for dyskeratosis congenita.

Walne et al. (2008) identified heterozygous mutations in the TINF2 gene
in 33 (18.9%) of 175 cases of uncharacterized DKC. Of these 33 samples,
21 were found to have a mutation in arg282 in exon 6 (see, e.g., R282H;
604319.0002). The remaining 12 mutations were all in a tight cluster
between residues 280 and 298. No additional mutations were found
elsewhere in the gene. Most of the mutations were de novo. Clinically,
all the DKC patients with a TINF2 mutation had severe disease associated
with shorter telomeres compared to patients with DKC1 mutations.

Yang et al. (2011) found that expression of TIN2 with the K280E, R282H,
or R282S mutation in human cell lines recapitulated the telomere
shortening defect in DKC. These mutations did not affect total
telomerase activity, TIN2 localization at telomeres, telomere end
protection, or expression or stability of other core telomeric proteins.
Despite the clustering of these mutation near the TRF1-binding motif,
they did not affect interaction of TIN2 with TRF1. However, all 3
mutations reduced the level of telomerase activity and the amount of
TERC protein that immunoprecipitated with TIN2. Yang et al. (2011)
concluded that mutation of K280 or R282 in TIN2 results in defective
targeting of telomerase to telomere ends.

The 2 truncating mutations identified by Sasa et al. (2012) in 2
unrelated children with severe DKCA3 (Q269X, 604319.0005 and Q271X,
604319.0007, respectively) both occurred in exon 6, but affected the
more N-terminal region compared to earlier reported mutations and thus
extended the affected segment of the gene to amino acid 269. In vitro
functional expression studies in HEK293 cells showed that the Q269X
mutant protein was markedly impaired in its ability to interact with
TERF1. This was in contrast to R282H (604319.0002), which retained
substantial ability to interact with TERF1. These findings indicated
that disrupted TERF1 binding is not the main factor driving disease
pathogenesis, but may contribute to a more severe phenotype.

Vulliamy et al. (2012) identified 16 new families with mutations in exon
6 of the TINF2 gene ascertained from 224 consecutive patients with
different forms of bone marrow failure, including 46 with criteria
meeting dyskeratosis congenita, 122 with aplastic anemia, and 57 with
some features of DKC. Seven of the 46 patients with DKC carried
mutations, 5 of whom had the R252H mutation (604319.0002). Nine of 57
patients with bone marrow failure and some features of DKC were found to
carry mutations, including 2 with R282H, and 4 with nonsense or
frameshift mutations (see, e.g., 604319.0005 and 604319.0008). Telomere
length was only available for 7 of the mutation carriers, 6 of whom had
shortened telomeres. The seventh patient had a missense variant that was
also found in an asymptomatic individual, and both had normal telomere
lengths, suggesting that this variant was not disease causing. Vulliamy
et al. (2012) concluded that TINF2 mutations can cause a spectrum of
clinical features and that telomere length should be able to distinguish
pathogenic mutations from polymorphic variants in the absence of
functional data. Most of the mutations appeared to occur de novo.

DYSKERATOSIS CONGENITA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, 3
TINF2, LYS280GLU

In 4 members of a family with autosomal dominant dyskeratosis
congenita-3 (DKCA3; 613990), Savage et al. (2008) identified
heterozygosity for a A-to-G transition in exon 6 of the TINF2 gene
(Ex6+234A-G) that resulted in a lys-to-glu substitution at codon 280
(K280E). The mutation was also found in 2 family members who were
classified as silent carriers because, while they showed some clinical
features, did not meet the clinical definition of DKC; these 2
individuals as well as the 4 with a DKC diagnosis had telomere lengths
below the first percentile for age.

Yang et al. (2011) showed that the K280E mutation caused defective
targeting of telomerase to telomere ends.

REVESZ SYNDROME, INCLUDED
TINF2, ARG282HIS

In 3 individuals with autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita-3
(613990), Savage et al. (2008) identified heterozygosity for a G-to-A
transition in exon 6 of the TINF2 gene (Ex6+241G-A) that resulted in an
arg282-to-his (R282H) amino acid substitution. Two of these patients had
the 'DKC triad' of abnormal nails, reticular pigmentation, and oral
leukoplakia, with other features; 1 of these patients had Revesz
syndrome (268130). One patient without the DKC triad had dystrophic
nails and IgA deficiency. All 3 patients had telomere lengths below the
first percentile for age.

Tsangaris et al. (2008) identified a de novo heterozygous R282H mutation
in an 18-month-old girl with DKC who presented with pancytopenia and
ataxia. Brain imaging showed cerebellar hypoplasia. She later developed
a small area of leukoplakia, but had no nail dystrophy or skin
hyperpigmentation. Laboratory studies showed shortened telomeres and
decreased telomerase activity (92.5% reduction compared to control
values). The authors noted that the phenotype was consistent with the
ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome (159550), which may be part of the
phenotypic spectrum of DKC.

Yang et al. (2011) showed that the R282H mutation caused defective
targeting of telomerase to telomere ends.

By in vitro functional expression studies in HEK293 cells, Sasa et al.
(2012) demonstrated that the R282H mutant protein retained substantial
ability to interact with TERF1 (600951).

Vulliamy et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous R282H mutation in 7
unrelated patients with DKC. Two had a severe form of the disorder, with
additional features including growth retardation, retinopathy, ataxia,
developmental delay, and cerebellar hypoplasia, consistent with a
clinical diagnosis of Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome. Three patients had
classic DKC, with bone marrow failure and skin and nail involvement; 2
had leukoplakia. The last 2 patients had bone marrow failure with
variable features overlapping DKC, mainly nail dystrophy; 1 had
intracranial calcifications. Telomere length was only available from 4
of these patients, but all showed significantly shortened telomeres. The
findings indicated that TINF2 mutations can be associated with a broad
spectrum of phenotypes.

TINF2, ARG282SER

In a patient with autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita-3 (613990)
and very short telomeres, Savage et al. (2008) identified a C-to-A
transversion in exon 6 of the TINF2 gene (Ex6+240C-A) that resulted in
an arg282-to-ser substitution (R282S).

Yang et al. (2011) showed that the R282S mutation caused defective
targeting of telomerase to telomere ends.

In 7 patients with DKCA3 (613990), Walne et al. (2008) identified a

an arg282-to-cys (R282C) substitution.

.0005
DYSKERATOSIS CONGENITA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, 3
TINF2, GLN269TER

In a 4-year-old Hispanic boy with DKCA3 (613990), Sasa et al. (2012)
identified a de novo heterozygous 805C-T transition in exon 6 of the
TINF2 gene, resulting in a gln269-to-ter (Q269X) substitution. He
presented with pancytopenia, and was found to have nail dystrophy, oral
leukoplakia, and lacy hyperpigmentation of the neck and genital regions.
He also had undescended testis and phimosis. Telomere flow-FISH analysis
showed telomere lengths below the first percentile. He underwent
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The truncated protein was
expressed, but at lower levels than wildtype, suggesting decreased
stability. In vitro functional expression studies in HEK293 cells showed
that the Q269X mutant protein was markedly impaired in its ability to
interact with TERF1 (600951). This was in contrast to R282H
(604319.0002), which retained substantial ability to interact with
TERF1. These findings indicated that disrupted TERF1 binding is not the
main factor driving disease pathogenesis, but may contribute to a more
severe phenotype.

Vulliamy et al. (2012) reported a 4-year-old boy with bone marrow
failure and mucocutaneous features of DKC who had a Q269X mutation in
the TINF2 gene. Telomere length was significantly decreased compared to
controls.

.0006
REVESZ SYNDROME
TINF2, 1-BP DEL, 839A

In a 21-month-old Hispanic boy with Revesz syndrome (268130), Sasa et
al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (839delA) in exon 6
of the TINF2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination.
The mutation was not present in the mother, but the reportedly normal
father was not available. The child presented with severe aplastic
anemia and was noted to have bilateral exudative retinopathy at age 9
months. He also had poor growth, nail dystrophy, oral leukoplakia, and
delayed development with wide-based gait, suggesting cerebellar
involvement. He underwent cord blood transplantation, but died 92 days
later. Telomere lengths were shortened. A truncated protein was
expressed, but at lower levels than wildtype, suggesting decreased
stability.

In a Caucasian girl with DKCA3 (613990), Sasa et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous 811C-T transition in exon 6 of the TINF2 gene, resulting in
a gln271-to-ter (Q271X) substitution. She presented at age 21 months
with severe aplastic anemia and underwent hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation. Subsequently, she developed skin hyperpigmentation,
nail dystrophy, and oral leukoplakia, as well as epiphora, esophageal
stricture, and osteopenia-related fractures. At age 10 years, she had
progressive interstitial lung disease with fibrosis, gastrointestinal
bleeding secondary to enteropathy, and noncirrhotic portal hypertension.
She died at age 12 years from multiorgan failure.

In a 3-year-old girl with bone marrow failure, nail dystrophy, lichenoid
tongue, dry skin, and intrauterine growth retardation consistent with
DKCA3 (613990), Vulliamy et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 1-bp
deletion (826delA) in the TINF2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and
premature termination (Arg276GlyfsTer41). Telomere length was decreased
compared to controls.

606357	TITLE *606357 DEAD/H BOX 21; DDX21
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DDX21, a member of the DEAD box gene family, encodes a putative
ATP-dependent RNA helicase that unwinds double-stranded RNA, folds
single-stranded RNA, and may play important roles in ribosomal RNA
biogenesis, RNA editing, RNA transport, and general transcription. For
additional background information on the DEAD box gene family, see DDX8
(600396).

CLONING

To identify an antigen recognized by the autoimmune serum of a patient
with watermelon stomach disease (gastric antral vascular ectasia),
Valdez et al. (1996) cloned a DDX21 cDNA encoding a deduced 801-amino
acid protein, which they called RNA helicase II/Gu, that has a molecular
mass of approximately 100 kD and localizes to the nucleolus. They
concluded that DDX21 belongs to the DEXD box family, a variation of the
DEAD box family. The human DDX21 protein shares with its mouse
counterpart 82.1% overall sequence identity and 100% conservation in the
9 motifs conserved among RNA helicases. Using Northern blot analysis,
Valdez et al. (1996) detected a 4.5-kb DDX21 transcript in HeLa cells.
Valdez and Wang (2000) detected expression of mouse Ddx21 in liver,
testis, brain, lung, and skeletal muscle. Valdez et al. (1996) found
that DDX21 contains ATP-dependent helicase activity which preferably
translocates in the 5-prime to 3-prime direction.

By RNA dot blot analysis, Valdez et al. (2002) detected variable DDX21
expression in all normal tissues examined, and expression was
downregulated in some tumor tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation and protein pull-down analyses using biotinylated
poly I:C, Zhang et al. (2011) identified a cytosolic,
endosome-independent sensor of viral nucleotides consisting of the RNA
helicases Ddx1 (601257), Ddx21, and Dhx36 (612767) and the adaptor
molecule Trif (TICAM1; 607601) in mouse myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs).
The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensors Pkr (EIF2AK2; 176871) and Lgp2
(DHX58; 608588) were also precipitated. Knockdown of each helicase via
short hairpin RNA blocked the ability of mDCs to mount type I interferon
(see 147660) and cytokine responses to poly I:C, influenza A, and
reovirus. Ddx1 bound poly I:C through its helicase A domain, while Dhx36
and Ddx21 bound the TIR domain of Trif via their HA2-DUF and PRK
domains, respectively. Zhang et al. (2011) concluded that the
DDX1-DDX21-DHX36 complex is a dsRNA sensor that uses the TRIF pathway to
activate type I interferon responses in the cytosol of mDCs.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhu et al. (2001) determined that the DDX21 gene contains 15 exons and
spans more than 29 kb of genomic DNA. Using a luciferase-based reporter
system, they identified a minimal promoter 85 bp upstream of a
transcription start site identified using RNase protection and primer
extension.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the DDX21
gene to human chromosome 10. By FISH, Valdez and Wang (2000) mapped the
mouse Ddx21 gene to chromosome 10B4-B5.1.

By genomic sequence analysis, Valdez et al. (2002) mapped the DDX21 gene
to chromosome 10q21 near the DDX50 gene (610373). The 2 genes are in
tandem orientation and separated by 10 kb. Mouse Ddx21 and Ddx50 genes
are also tandemly oriented on mouse chromosome 10.

600007	TITLE *600007 FMS-RELATED TYROSINE KINASE 3 LIGAND; FLT3LG
;;FLT3 LIGAND; FL; FLT3L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dendritic cells (DCs) provide the key link between innate and adaptive
immunity by recognizing pathogens and priming pathogen-specific immune
responses. FLT3LG controls the development of DCs and is particularly
important for plasmacytoid DCs and CD8 (see 186910)-positive classical
DCs and their CD103 (ITGAE; 604682)-positive tissue counterparts
(summary by Sathaliyawala et al., 2010).

CLONING

FMS-related tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3; 136351) is a tyrosine kinase
receptor structurally related to macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(CSF1; 120420) and to mast cell growth factor receptor (KIT; 164920).
From a murine T-cell line, Lyman et al. (1993) cloned a novel
hematopoietic growth factor that is a ligand for FLT3. Lyman et al.
(1994) used a fragment of the murine cDNA to clone the human FLT3
ligand, which is similar in structure to the murine protein and shares
72% amino acid identity. Northern blot analysis showed widespread
expression of FLT3 ligand mRNA transcripts in human tissues.

Hannum et al. (1994) isolated a soluble protein that showed FL activity
from medium conditioned by mouse thymic stromal cells. By sequencing
peptides and screening thymic stromal cell lines, they cloned splice
variants of mouse and human FL. The deduced 235- and 245-amino acid
human isoforms differ in their C-terminal segments, with the shorter
protein containing a unique transmembrane domain. The N terminus of both
isoforms contains a signal peptide followed by a cytokine domain related
to KIT ligand (KITLG; 184745) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(CSF1; 120420). The cytokine domain also has N-glycosylation sites.
Northern blot analysis showed widespread expression in mouse and human
tissues, with highest levels in spleen and lung. The major human
transcript was 1.6 kb. High expression was also detected in mouse and
human stromal cell lines, with highest levels in T-cell lines and
peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Lyman et al. (1993) found that Flt3 ligand stimulated proliferation of
hematopoietic progenitor cells isolated from mouse fetal liver or adult
mouse bone marrow.

Hannum et al. (1994) showed that transfection of COS cells with mouse
and human FL containing the C-terminal transmembrane domain resulted in
secretion of a soluble protein with FL activity. Assays of C-terminally
truncated FL proteins confirmed that the N-terminal half conferred FL
activity. Recombinant protein produced by either mouse fibroblasts or E.
coli induced tyrosine autophosphorylation of Flt3 on mouse cells. The
purified protein enhanced the response of mouse stem cells and primitive
human progenitor cells to other growth factors, such as IL3 (147740),
IL6 (147620), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(CSF2; 138960), and it also stimulated fetal thymocytes. Hannum et al.
(1994) concluded that FL enhances the response of stem and primitive
progenitor cells to other growth factors to generate all myeloid
lineages except erythroid cells.

Sathaliyawala et al. (2010) found that the Mtor (FRAP1; 601231)
inhibitor rapamycin impaired mouse Flt3l-driven DC development in vitro,
with plasmacytoid DCs and classical DCs most profoundly affected.
Depletion of the Pi3k (see 601232)-Mtor negative regulator Pten (601728)
facilitated Flt3l-driven DC development in culture. Targeting Pten in
DCs in vivo caused expansion of Cd8-positive and Cd103-positive
classical DCs, which could be reversed by rapamycin. Increased
Cd8-positive classical DC numbers caused by Pten deletion correlated
with increased susceptibility to Listeria infection. Sathaliyawala et
al. (2010) concluded that PI3K-MTOR signaling downstream of FLT3L
controls DC development, and that restriction by PTEN ensures optimal DC
numbers and subset composition.

604188	TITLE *604188 SELENIUM-BINDING PROTEIN 1; SELENBP1
;;SELENIUM-BINDING PROTEIN, 56-KD; SP56
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Selenium is an essential nutrient that exhibits potent anticarcinogenic
properties, and deficiency of selenium may cause certain neurologic
diseases. It has been proposed that the effects of selenium in
preventing cancer and neurologic diseases may be mediated by
selenium-binding proteins. By sequencing randomly selected human fetal
heart cDNAs, followed by searching sequence databases for sequence
similarities, Chang et al. (1997) identified a cDNA that has sequence
similarity to the mouse 56-kD selenium-binding protein (Sp56) gene. The
deduced 472-amino acid human SP56 (SELENBP1) has 87.3% and 86.4% amino
acid identity to mouse Sp56 and the acetaminophen metabolite-binding
protein AP56, respectively. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues
detected the highest Sp56 expression in liver, kidney, and lung (see
also Lanfear et al., 1993).

GENE FUNCTION

Okunuki et al. (2007) identified selenium-binding protein as a candidate
retinal autoantigen in patients with Behcet disease (109650). Because
anti-SELENBP1 antibody-positive patients showed more frequent ocular
inflammation than the antibody-negative patient group, Okunuki et al.
(2007) concluded that autoimmunity against this retinal antigen might
contribute to the pathogenesis of uveitis in BD patients.

MAPPING

By FISH, Chang et al. (1997) mapped the SELENBP1 gene to 1q21-q22.

111730	TITLE *111730 BETA-1,4-N-ACETYL-GALACTOSAMINYLTRANSFERASE 2; B4GALNT2
;;GALGT2;;
CT-GalNAc TRANSFERASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

B4GALNT2 catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of the human Sd(a)
antigen, which is found on more than 90% of Caucasian red blood cells,
through the addition of an N-acetylgalactosamine residue via a beta-1,4
linkage to a subterminal galactose residue substituted with an
alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid. B4GALNT2 also catalyzes the last step in
the biosynthesis of the Cad antigen, which is related both serologically
and biochemically to the Sd(a) antigen (summary by Montiel et al.,
2003).

CLONING

CT1 and CT2 are monoclonal antibodies that recognize an oligosaccharide
structure that is identical, at least in part, to Sd(a). Using
expression cloning to identify a mouse cDNA that synthesized an epitope
recognized by CT2, Smith and Lowe (1994) cloned B4galnt2, which they
designated CT-GalNAc transferase. The deduced 510-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 58.3 kD. It has characteristics of a type
II transmembrane glycosyltransferase, with a short N-terminal tail,
followed by a transmembrane domain and a 478-amino acid C-terminal
catalytic domain predicted to face the Golgi lumen. The mouse CT-GalNAc
transferase cDNA shares 51% nucleotide identity with the human cDNA
encoding GM2/GD2 synthase (B4GALNT1; 601873), with highest identity in
the region encoding the catalytic domain.

Dohi et al. (1996) obtained a partial human B4GALNT2 sequence by RT-PCR
of gastric mucosa RNA using primers based on mouse CT-GalNAcT. The human
cDNA fragment shared 86% nucleotide identity with mouse CT-GalNAc
transferase and 63% identity with human GM2/GD2 GalNAc transferase.
Northern blot analysis detected a 2-kb B4GALNT2 transcript in normal
gastric mucosa. RT-PCR detected expression in normal human stomach,
jejunum, and ileum, with a proximal-to-distal gradient of expression in
colon.

By searching databases for sequence similar to mouse B4galnt2, followed
by RT-PCR and 5-prime RACE of a human colon carcinoma cell line, Montiel
et al. (2003) cloned 2 variants of B4GALNT2. The longer transcript
encodes a deduced 566-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular
mass of 63.3 kD. It contains an N-terminal cytosolic domain, followed by
a transmembrane domain and a long catalytic domain. The shorter
transcript encodes a deduced 506-amino acid protein with calculated
molecular mass of 57.0 kD. It has a different N-terminal cytosolic
domain than the full-length form. Northern blot analysis detected
B4GALNT2 transcripts of 8.8, 6.1, 4.7, 3.8, and 1.65 kb. Highest
expression was in colon, with lower expression in kidney, stomach,
ileum, and rectum. RNA dot blot analysis showed basal and low expression
of B4GALNT2 in all normal tissues examined, and RT-PCR detected
expression in several cancer cell lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Montiel et al. (2003) determined that the B4GALNT2 gene contains at
least 12 exons, including 2 alternatively spliced first exons, and spans
more than 36 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Montiel et al. (2003) mapped the B4GALNT2
gene to chromosome 17q23.1. The mouse gene maps to chromosome 11 in a
region that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 17 (Mohlke et
al., 1999).

GENE FUNCTION

By biochemical analysis, Smith and Lowe (1994) confirmed that mouse
CT-GalNAc transferase synthesized the epitope recognized by human
anti-Sd(a) serum.

Using RT-PCR, Dohi et al. (1996) found that 6 of 9 cases of gastric
cancer and 9 of 13 cases of colonic cancer lacked B4GALNT2 transcript.
These results correlated with a lack of B4GALNT2 activity measured in
the same samples. Dohi et al. (1996) concluded that reduced B4GALNT2
transcription results in disappearance of the Sd(a) epitope in
gastrointestinal cancer.

Montiel et al. (2003) found that a soluble B4GALNT2 protein N-terminally
truncated at gly89 could transfer N-acetylgalactosamine to several
natural and synthetic acceptor substrates, but it required a galactose
residue to be beta-1,3-linked to an N-acetylglucosamine or
N-acetylgalactosamine residue or beta-1,4-linked to glucose or an
N-acetylglucosamine residue.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

ANIMAL MODEL

Type I von Willebrand disease (VWD1; 193400), characterized by reduced
levels of plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF; 613160), is the most common
inherited bleeding disorder in humans. Mohlke et al. (1996) noted that
penetrance of VWD is incomplete, and expression of the bleeding
phenotype is highly variable. In addition, plasma VWF levels vary widely
among normal individuals. It is likely that the wide range of severity,
variable expressivity, and incomplete penetrance of von Willebrand
disease eventually may be explained through a complex series of
interactions between the VWF gene and a variety of modifier genes,
including proteins involved in posttranslational processing and other
aspects of VWF biosynthesis and clearance. To identify genes that
influence VWF level, Mohlke et al. (1996) analyzed a genetic cross
between 2 strains of mice that exhibit a 20-fold difference in plasma
Vwf levels (Sweeney et al., 1990). DNA samples from F2 progeny
demonstrating either extremely high or extremely low plasma Vwf levels
were pooled and phenotyped for 41 markers spanning the autosomal genome.
A novel locus accounting for 63% of the total variance in Vwf levels was
mapped to distal mouse chromosome 11, a site distinct from the murine
Vwf locus on chromosome 6. Mohlke et al. (1996) designated the locus
Mvwf for 'modifier of Vwf.' Additional genotyping of as many as 2,407
meioses established a high resolution genetic map placing the gene
between Ngfr (162010) and Hoxb9 (142964), and it was closely linked to
Gip (137240). The Mvwf candidate interval between Ngfr and Hoxb9 was
approximately 0.5 cM. The results of Mohlke et al. (1996) demonstrated
that a single dominant gene accounted for the low Vwf phenotype of 1
strain of mice and crosses with several other strains. The pattern of
inheritance suggested a gain-of-function mutation in a unique component
of Vwf biosynthesis or processing. They commented that characterization
of the human homolog for Mvwf may have relevance for a subset of type 1
VWD cases and may define an important genetic factor modifying
penetrance and expression of mutations at the VWF locus.

GALGT2 is expressed primarily in the gut epithelium in both mice and
humans. Mohlke et al. (1999) found that Mvwf, the gene responsible for
modifying plasma levels of Vwf in a strain of mice, was Galgt2. They
showed that the mutation causing deficiency of Vwf changed expression of
the gene from gut specific to the vascular endothelium. Ginsburg (1999)
expressed the opinion that the same alteration is highly unlikely in
humans. However, the Mvwf modifier gene effect may be a useful paradigm
for understanding genetic modification of plasma VWF levels.

IKAROS/BCL6 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ikaros proteins are lymphoid-restricted zinc finger transcription
factors that are considered master regulators of lymphocyte
differentiation. Klug et al. (1998) noted that there are at least 8
alternatively spliced transcripts of the Ikaros gene that encode
isoforms with common N-terminal and C-terminal domains. By screening a
Jurkat T-cell cDNA library with a mouse Ikaros cDNA, Molnar et al.
(1996) isolated human Ikaros cDNAs. The deduced human and mouse Ikaros
proteins are 95% identical. RT-PCR of human thymus and peripheral blood
leukocyte mRNAs detected 6 Ikaros splicing variants which were expressed
at similar levels and ratios as the corresponding mouse leukocyte Ikaros
transcripts. The authors found that Ikaros proteins are conserved in
sequence composition and relative expression between human T cells and
mouse thymocytes. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the expression of
7.5- and 4.5-kb Ikaros transcripts in human thymus, spleen, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

By PCR using primers based on a conserved nucleotide sequence of various
zinc finger proteins, Nietfeld and Meyerhans (1996) cloned human bone
marrow cDNAs encoding Ikaros, which they designated IK1. The deduced
519-amino acid protein is 93% identical to the mouse Ikaros isoform
1/LyF1 isoform VI and contains 4 N-terminal and 2 C-terminal zinc finger
domains. The authors detected 3 human mRNA species by Northern blot
analysis: a 4.4-kb transcript, which was prominent in peripheral blood
leukocytes; a 6.0-kb transcript, which was strongly expressed in spleen,
thymus, lymph node, and bone marrow; and a 7.0-kb transcript. They
stated that the human and mouse Ikaros genes have similar overall
transcription patterns.

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the N-terminal Kruppel-like zinc finger
domain of Ikaros proteins is involved in DNA binding, while the
C-terminal zinc finger domain mediates homo- or heterodimerization with
other Ikaros proteins. Alternative splicing of exons 3 to 6 produces
Ikaros isoforms with 0 to 4 N-terminal zinc fingers, and those with at
least 3 efficiently bind DNA. The DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms include
IK1, IK2, IK3, and IKX, and IK4 can bind DNA on palindromic sequences.
IK5, IK6, IK7, and IK8 are considered dominant-negative isoforms due to
their capacity to bind other isoforms and their inefficiency in binding
DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Harker et al. (2002) showed that Ikaros may play an important role in
CD4 (186940) versus CD8 (see CD8A; 186910) lineage commitment decisions
by demonstrating: (1) that it binds to regulatory elements in the
endogenous CD8A locus in vivo using thymocyte chromatin
immunoprecipitations; (2) that Ikaros suppresses position effect
variegation of transgenes driven by CD8 regulatory elements; and (3)
that mice with reduced levels of Ikaros and Aiolos (606221) show an
apparent increase in CD4 populations with immature phenotype, i.e.,
cells that fail to activate the CD8A gene. The authors proposed that
Ikaros family members function as activators of the CD8A gene and that
their associated activities are critical for appropriate chromatin
remodeling transitions during thymocyte differentiation and lineage
commitment.

Ezzat et al. (2005) demonstrated that Ikaros is expressed in the
hormone-producing pituitary corticomelanotroph cells of mice, where it
binds the proopiomelanocortin promoter and regulates endogenous gene
expression. Ikaros-null mice had contraction of the pituitary
corticomelanotroph population, reduced circulating adrenocorticotrophic
hormone levels, and adrenal glucocorticoid insufficiency. Hematopoietic
reconstitution failed to correct this hormonal deficit, but the
phenotype of reduced body weight and diminished survival was rescued by
systemic glucocorticoid-hormone administration. Ezzat et al. (2005)
concluded that Ikaros plays a role in orchestrating immune-endocrine
development and function.

Yap et al. (2005) identified Ikaros-binding elements in the 5-prime
flanking regions of pufferfish, mouse, and human STAT4 (600558).
Transactivation, electrophoretic mobility shift, and RNA interference
analyses showed that Ikaros bound to the STAT4 promoter and was involved
in regulation of STAT4 in human T cells.

Dijon et al. (2008) found that purified CD34 (142230)-positive human
cord blood cells and adult peripheral blood cells that were cultured
under erythroid conditions expressed the DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms IK1
through IK4, but not the dominant-negative isoform IK6.
Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that expression of IK6 in these
cells resulted in complex formation between IK6 and IK1, and IK6
decreased cell number and increased cell death. IK6 overexpression
disturbed erythroid differentiation and expression of erythroid-specific
genes, although it had no effect on Ikaros expression, and favored
myelopoiesis by promoting expression of myeloid-specific genes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the IKZF1 gene contains 7 translated
exons.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid DNAs, Molnar et al. (1996) mapped the human
Ikaros gene to 7p13-p11.1, near the EGFR gene (131550). They mapped the
mouse Ikaros gene to chromosome 11 by interspecific backcross analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ikaros is required for normal lymphocyte development. Germline mutant
mice that express only non-DNA-binding dominant-negative 'leukemogenic'
Ikaros isoforms lacking critical N-terminal zinc fingers develop an
aggressive form of lymphoblastic leukemia 3 to 6 months after birth (see
'Animal Model' below). These facts prompted Sun et al. (1999) to seek
molecular abnormalities involving the Ikaros gene in acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL2; 613067) in infants. In leukemic cells from 12 ALL
infants less than 1 year of age, Sun et al. (1999) found high-level
expression of dominant-negative isoforms of Ikaros with abnormal
subcellular compartmentalization patterns. PCR cloning and nucleotide
sequencing were used to identify the specific Ikaros isoforms and detect
Ikaros gene mutations in these cells. Leukemic cells from 7 of 7 infants
with ALL, including 5 of 5 MLL-AF4-positive (159557) infants, expressed
dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms IK4, IK7, and IK8 that lack critical
N-terminal zinc fingers. In 6 of 7 patients, Sun et al. (1999) detected
an in-frame deletion of 10 amino acids (KSSMPQKFLG) upstream of the
transcription-activation domain adjacent to the C-terminal zinc fingers
of IK2, IK4, IK7, and IK8. In contrast, only wildtype IK1 and IK2
isoforms with normal nuclear localization were found in normal infant
bone marrow cells and infant thymocytes. These results implicated the
expression of dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms and the disruption of
normal Ikaros function in the leukemogenesis of ALL in infants.

Nakase et al. (2000) found overexpression of the dominant-negative IK6
isoform in 14 of 41 B-cell patients with adult B-cell ALL. None of the
other dominant-negative isoforms of the Ikaros gene were detected by
RT-PCR analysis. Southern blot analysis with PstI digestion revealed
that those patients with the dominant-negative IK6 isoform might have
small mutations in the Ikaros locus. The results suggested that Ikaros
plays a key role in human B-cell malignancies through the
dominant-negative isoform IK6.

Using RT-PCR to detect Ikaros isoforms with the 30-base deletion in exon
6, Payne et al. (2001) showed that transcripts for IK1 and IK1 with the
deletion were present in normal cord blood and bone marrow, as well as
in 3 ALL cell lines. In addition, they identified an isoform, IKX, that
was identical to IK3 except that it included exon 6; IKX was generated
from a novel exon combination with and without the 30-base deletion.
Payne et al. (2001) detected multiple DNA-binding and nonbinding
isoforms with a 60-base insertion linked to leukemia expressed at the
RNA level in normal hemopoietic cells. Immunoblot analysis indicated
that the predominant isoform in normal cells is IKX, while the
predominant form in leukemic cells is IK1.

In a genomewide analysis of leukemic cells from 242 pediatric ALL
patients using high resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
arrays and genomic DNA sequencing, Mullighan et al. (2007) identified
mutations in genes encoding principal regulators of B-lymphocyte
development and differentiation in 40% of B-progenitor ALL cases.
Deletions were detected in IKZF1, IKZF3 (606221),TCF3 (147141), EBF1
(164343), and LEF1 (153245). The PAX5 (167414) gene was the most
frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7% of cases.

The Philadelphia chromosome, a chromosomal abnormality that encodes
BCR-ABL1 (see 151410, 189980), is the defining lesion of chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL). To define oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to
induce ALL, Mullighan et al. (2008) performed a genomewide analysis of
diagnostic leukemia samples from 304 individuals with ALL, including 43
BCR-ABL1 B-progenitor ALLs and 23 CML cases. IKZF1, encoding the
transcription factor Ikaros, was deleted in 83.7% of BCR-ABL1 ALL, but
not in chronic phase CML. Deletion of IKZF1 was also identified as an
acquired lesion at the time of transformation of CML to ALL (lymphoid
blast crisis). The IKZF1 deletions resulted in haploinsufficiency,
expression of a dominant-negative Ikaros isoform, or the complete loss
of Ikaros expression. Sequencing of IKZF1 deletion breakpoints suggested
that aberrant RAG-mediated recombination (see 179615) is responsible for
the deletions. Mullighan et al. (2008) concluded that genetic lesions
resulting in the loss of Ikaros function are an important event in the
development of BCR-ABL1 ALL.

Mullighan et al. (2009) identified deletions involving the IKZF1 gene in
leukemic cells of 63 (28.6%) of 221 children with B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. Cells from 20 patients had a deletion of coding
exons 3 through 6, resulting in the expression of a dominant-negative
form of IKZF1. IKZF1 deletions were associated with an increased risk of
relapse and adverse effects in the original cohort and in an independent
cohort of 258 patients (p values ranging from less than 0.001 to 0.004).

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
IKZF1 gene and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, see ALL2 (613067).

CYTOGENETICS

The BCL6 gene (109565), isolated from the breakpoints of 3q27-associated
chromosomal translocations, is implicated in diffuse large B-cell
lymphomas (DLBL). Hosokawa et al. (2000) described the molecular
characterization of novel t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations in 2 patients
with DLBL. Molecular genetic analysis of the breakpoint area involving
BCL6 revealed the presence of the Ikaros gene. As a molecular
consequence of the translocation, the 5-prime regulatory region of BCL6
was replaced by the putative 5-prime regulatory region of the Ikaros
gene, probably leading to deregulated expression of the BCL6 gene
throughout B-cell differentiation. RT-PCR and FISH analyses of a patient
sample established that the translocation resulted in fusion of the
Ikaros and BCL6 genes. The clinical features of the 2 patients with DLBL
and t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations were reported by Ichinohasama et al.
(1998).

ANIMAL MODEL

Mice homozygous for a germline mutation in the Ikaros DNA-binding domain
lack not only T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, but also
their earliest defined progenitors (Georgopoulos et al., 1994). In
contrast, the erythroid and myeloid lineages are intact in these mutant
mice. Klug et al. (1998) showed that the DNA-binding isoforms of mouse
Ikaros are localized in the nucleus of the most primitive hematopoietic
stem cell subset. They found that Ikaros localizes to heterochromatin in
Abelson-transformed pre-B lymphocytes. Changes in the RNA splicing
pattern of Ikaros occurred at 2 stages of lymphoid differentiation.

O'Neill et al. (1999, 2000) described the structure of a chromatin
remodeling complex associated with Ikaros that is present only in adult
hematopoietic cells. This complex binds to Ikaros-like DNA-binding
sites, including a long polypyrimidine-rich sequence upstream of the
human delta-globin gene (142000), and was thus called PYR complex.
Deletion of this sequence in a human beta locus-containing cosmid
(carrying sequences from the human gamma-A gene, 142200, through the
adult beta-globin gene, 141900) in transgenic mice resulted in delayed
switching from gamma-globin to beta-globin. Lopez et al. (2002) showed
that homozygous Ikaros-null mice lacked the PYR complex, demonstrating a
requirement for Ikaros in the formation of the complex on DNA.
Heterozygous Ikaros-null mice had about half as much PYR complex,
indicating a dosage effect for both Ikaros and PYR complex. They also
showed that Ikaros-null mice had multiple hematopoietic cell defects,
including anemia and megakaryocytic abnormalities, in addition to
lymphoid and stem cell defects. The null mice also had a delay in murine
embryonic-to-adult beta-globin switching and a delay in human
gamma-to-beta switching, consistent with the suggested role for PYR
complex in this process. Lastly, cDNA array analyses indicated that
several hematopoietic cell-specific genes in all blood lineages were
either up- or downregulated in 14-day embryos from Ikaros-null mice
compared with wildtype mice. These results indicated that Ikaros and PYR
complex function together in vivo at many adult hematopoietic
cell-specific genes and at intergenic sites, affecting their expression
and leading to pleiotropic hematopoietic defects.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are specialized dendritic cells that
produce high levels of type I interferon (see IFNA1; 147660) upon viral
infection. Allman et al. (2006) showed that mice expressing low levels
of Ikaros lacked peripheral plasmacytoid dendritic cells but not other
dendritic cell subsets. Loss of plasmacytoid dendritic cells was
associated with inability to produce type I interferon after challenge
with Tlr7 (300365) or Tlr9 (605474) ligands or murine cytomegalovirus.
Conventional dendritic cells were present in normal numbers and
exhibited normal responses to in vivo challenge with murine
cytomegalovirus or inactivated toxoplasma antigen.

173880	TITLE *173880 POLYMERIC IMMUNOGLOBULIN RECEPTOR; PIGR
;;POLY-Ig RECEPTOR;;
TRANSMEMBRANE SECRETORY COMPONENT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The poly-Ig receptor is expressed on several glandular epithelia
including those of liver and breast. It mediates transcellular transport
of polymeric immunoglobulin molecules. It is a member of the
immunoglobulin superfamily (Hood et al., 1985). The receptor has 5 units
with homology to the variable (V) units of immunoglobulins and a
transmembrane region, which also has some homology to certain
immunoglobulin variable regions.

CLONING

Davidson et al. (1988) cloned the human PIGR gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krajci et al. (1992) identified 11 exons covering the entire PIGR coding
region.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2000) reported that human PIGR can bind to a major
pneumococcal adhesin, CbpA. Expression of PIGR in human nasopharyngeal
cells and MDCK cells greatly enhanced pneumococcal adherence and
invasion. The PIGR-mediated bacterial adherence and invasion were
abolished by either insertional knockout of CbpA or antibodies against
either PIGR or CbpA. These results suggested that pneumococci are a
novel example of a pathogen coopting the PIG transcytosis machinery to
promote translocation across a mucosal barrier.

PIGR binds its ligand, dimeric IgA (dIgA; see 146900), at the
basolateral surface of epithelial cells. After endocytosis, the
PIGR-dIgA complex traverses several endosomal compartments and is
exocytosed at the apical plasma membrane. Van IJzendoorn et al. (2002)
found that Rab3b (179510) localized to vesicular structures containing
Pigr in canine kidney cells and that GTP-bound Rab3b interacted directly
with the cytoplasmic domain of Pigr. Binding of dIgA to Pigr dissociated
Rab3b, but a constitutively active Rab3b mutant maintained its
interaction with Pigr in dIgA-treated cells. Furthermore, GTP-locked
Rab3b inhibited dIgA-stimulated transcytosis.

MAPPING

Davidson et al. (1988) localized the PIGR gene to 1q31-q41 by a
combination of somatic cell hybridization and in situ hybridization. By
Southern blot analysis of human/rodent somatic hybrid panels, including
hybrids with translocation chromosomes carrying different parts of
chromosome 1, Krajci et al. (1991) confirmed the assignment of PIGR to
1q31-q42. Krajci et al. (1992) found linkage evidence supporting the
location of PIGR in this region.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Obara et al. (2003) performed a case-control association study involving
389 Japanese patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN; 161950)
and 465 controls. A significant association was found between IgAN and 6
SNPs in the PIGR gene. One of the SNPs, PIGR17, caused an amino acid
substitution from alanine to valine at codon 580. Another SNP, PIGR2,
may affect promoter activity. Pairwise analyses demonstrated that all 6
SNPs were in almost complete linkage disequilibrium. Biopsy specimens
from IgAN patients were positively stained by antibody against the
secretory component of PIGR, but corresponding tissues from non-IgAN
patients were not.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
PIGR, ALA580VAL

This variant, formerly titled IgA NEPHROPATHY, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, has
been reclassified based on the findings of Maxwell and Wang (2006).

In a case-control association study involving 389 Japanese patients with
immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IGAN; 161950) and 465 controls, Obara et
al. (2003) found an association between an SNP, designated PIGR17, and
IGAN. The PIGR17 SNP consists of a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1740
in exon 7, which results in an ala-to-val amino acid substitution at
codon 580 (A580V). The odds ratio of homozygotes for the minor allele
(T) compared to CC or CT genotypes was 2.71.

Maxwell and Wang (2006) included the PIGR variant reported by Obara et
al. (2003) in a table of genetic associations with IgA nephropathy,
noting that although plausible, these genetic associations had not
generally been observed in more than 1 study and could not be proved to
contribute to IgA nephropathy causation or progression.
