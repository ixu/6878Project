DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PITPNM1 belongs to a family of membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol
transfer domain-containing proteins that share homology with the
Drosophila retinal degeneration B (rdgB) protein (Ocaka et al., 2005).

CLONING

The Drosophila rdgB gene encodes a 116-kD transmembrane protein
expressed in the eye and central nervous system (CNS). Mutations in rdgB
cause light-induced retinal degeneration (Vihtelic et al., 1991). By
screening an EST database for homologs of Drosophila rdgB, followed by
probing a teratocarcinoma/neuron cDNA library, Rubboli et al. (1997)
obtained a full-length cDNA encoding human PITPNM1, which they called
DRES9. The predicted 1,242-amino acid PITPNM1 protein shares 96% and 66%
amino acid identity with mouse Pitpnm1 and Drosophila rdgB,
respectively. Northern blot analysis showed ubiquitous expression of a
4.4-kb PITPNM1 transcript, with highest levels in brain, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and heart. In situ hybridization analysis of murine
embryo tissues at various developmental stages revealed high Pitpnm1
expression in the neural retina and in the CNS.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to bovine rdgB, Chang
et al. (1997) identified partial human PITPNM1 sequences, which they
used to obtain genomic clones. The deduced 1,059-amino acid protein
shares 92% identity with mouse Pitpnm1, with highest similarity in the
N- and C-terminal regions. Northern blot analysis indicated that bovine
and mouse Pitpnm1 were expressed strongly in retina and more weakly in
brain, but not in any other tissue examined. In situ hybridization of
mouse retina detected Pitpnm1 mRNA in photoreceptors and the inner
nuclear layer. Immunocytochemistry detected Pitpnm1 in photoreceptors,
particularly in the inner segments and the outer plexiform layer, the
inner plexiform layer, and possibly the ganglion cell layer.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a brain cDNA library, Lev et al. (1999)
cloned PITPNM1, which they called NIR2, as one of a family of proteins
that interact with the tyrosine kinase PYK2 (PTK2B; 601212). The deduced
1,244-amino acid PITPNM1 protein shares structural domains with other
family members, including an N-terminal phosphatidylinositol (PI)
transfer domain, an acidic calcium-binding region, 6 transmembrane
domains, and a conserved C-terminal domain. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression of PITPNM1, with highest levels in brain,
heart, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Chang et al. (1997) demonstrated the mouse Pitpnm1 fully rescued the
rdgB-dependent retinal degeneration and abnormal electroretinogram in
flies.

Lev et al. (1999) determined that the C terminus of PITPNM1 bound PYK2.
Analysis of PITPNM1 or PYK2 immunoprecipitates of cells coexpressing
PITPNM1 and PYK2 demonstrated that both proteins were tyrosine
phosphorylated. Agonists known to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of
PYK2 also induced strong phosphorylation of PITPNM1, and both proteins
were associated in a stable complex. Chang et al. (1997) concluded that
PITPNM1 is a direct or indirect substrate for PYK2 tyrosine
phosphorylation.

Tian et al. (2002) showed that PITPNM1 contains a novel N-terminal Rho
(see RhoA; 165390)-inhibitory domain (RID) that binds to GDP-bound Rho.
Ectopic expression of the PITPNM1 RID domain caused loss of F-actin
staining and inhibited Rho-mediated stress fiber formation and
lysophosphatidic acid-induced RhoA activation. Expression of the RID
domain along with the PI transfer domain removed these effects. Blocking
of PITPNM1 function by PITPNM1 antibody injection reduced neurite
extension in neuronal cells, while PITPNM1 overexpression reduced
Rho-mediated neurite retraction.

Litvak et al. (2002) showed that PITPNM1 is essential for cytokinesis.
PITPNM1 localized to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis, and
blocking of PITPNM1 function by PITPNM1 antibody injection caused
multinucleate cell formation. Overexpression of a deletion construct
lacking the N-terminal RID and PI domains caused specific blockage of
cytokinesis. Overexpression of the RID domain of PITPNM1 caused abnormal
cytokinesis, resulting in formation of a long bridge-like structure
between putative daughter cells. Coimmunoprecipitation showed that
PITPNM1 bound to RhoA in mitotic cells, and confocal microscopy showed
the 2 proteins localized together at the cleavage furrow during cell
division.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chang et al. (1997) determined that the PITPNM1 gene contains 21 exons
and spans about 12 kb. Ocaka et al. (2005) determined that the PITPNM1
gene contains 23 exons and spans approximately 13 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Chang et al. (1997) mapped the PITPNM1 gene to chromosome
11q13.1. They mapped the mouse Pitpnm1 gene to a proximal region of
chromosome 19 that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome
11q13.1.

605093	TITLE *605093 SH2B ADAPTOR PROTEIN 3; SH2B3
;;LYMPHOCYTE ADAPTOR PROTEIN; LNK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

T-cell activation requires stimulation of the T-cell receptor (TCR; see
186880)-CD3 (see CD3Z; 186780) complex, followed by recruitment of an
array of intracellular signaling proteins (e.g., GRB2 (108355) and PLCG1
(172420)). Mediating the interaction between the extracellular receptors
and intracellular signaling pathways are adaptor proteins such as LAT
(602354), TRIM (604962), and LNK.

CLONING

By PCR using primers based on the rat Lnk sequence and by screening a
Jurkat cDNA library, Li et al. (2000) obtained a cDNA encoding human
SH2B3, which they called LNK. Sequence analysis predicted that the
575-amino acid LNK protein contains an N-terminal proline-rich region, a
pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain; the
PH and SH2 domains are similar to those of the APS protein. Northern
blot analysis detected low expression of a 6.8-kb LNK transcript in
various lymphoid cell lines. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed
that the majority of LNK is located in the juxtanuclear region with some
found near the plasma membrane.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SH2B3
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP stSG3591). The SH2B3 gene maps to chromosome
12q24 (Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007).

GENE FUNCTION

Immunoprecipitation analysis by Li et al. (2000) demonstrated that LNK
is phosphorylated by LCK (153390) but not by SYK (600085) and that LNK
binds to the tyrosine-phosphorylated TCR zeta chain via its SH2 domain.
Functional analysis indicated that LNK inhibits the activation of NFAT
(see 600489) in stimulated T cells.

Velazquez et al. (2002) found that cells from Lnk-deficient mice showed
an increased sensitivity to several cytokines and altered activation of
the RAS/MAPK (see 190020) pathway in response to IL3 (147740) and stem
cell factor (SCF; 184745). Lnk -/- mice exhibited extramedullary
hemopoiesis with increased numbers of CD41 (see 607759)-positive
megakaryocytes as well as erythrocytes in splenic red pulp. In normal
mice, Lnk was highly expressed in multipotent cells in bone marrow,
lymph nodes, and in nonhemopoietic tissues such as testis, brain, and
muscle, but expression was low in spleen. Velazquez et al. (2002)
concluded that Lnk regulates proliferation of several hemopoietic cell
lineages.

Using Lnk -/- mice, Bersenev et al. (2008) found that Lnk controlled
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence and self-renewal predominantly
through the thrombopoietin receptor, Mpl (159530). Lnk -/- HSCs
displayed potentiated activation of Jak2 (147796) in response to
thrombopoietin (THPO; 600044). Biochemical experiments revealed that Lnk
directly bound phosphorylated tyrosine residues in Jak2 following Thpo
stimulation. In addition, a JAK2 mutant, val617 to phe (V617F
147796.0001), which is found at a high frequency in myeloproliferative
diseases, retained the ability to bind Lnk. Bersenev et al. (2008)
concluded that LNK is a negative regulator of JAK2 in stem cells and
that THPO, MPL, JAK2, and LNK form a regulatory pathway controlling stem
cell self-renewal and quiescence.

- Somatic Mutations

In 2 (6%) of 33 unrelated patients with various myeloproliferative
neoplasms, Oh et al. (2010) identified 2 different somatic mutations in
the SH2B3 gene. A 5-bp deletion resulting in premature termination was
found in a patient with primary myelofibrosis (254450), and a
glu208-to-gln (E208Q) substitution was found in a patient with essential
thrombocythemia (187950). The deletion was predicted to result in the
absence of both the PH and SH2 domains, whereas the missense mutation
was in the PH domain. In vitro functional expression studies showed that
the truncating mutation was unable to inhibit TPO (600044)-mediated
growth, and the missense mutation resulted in partial loss of this
inhibitory activity. Both mutations were associated with increased
activation of the JAK-STAT (see, e.g., 147796) signaling pathway,
resulting in cellular proliferation. In addition, both mutations were
present in early progenitor cells (CD34+) from the hematopoietic
compartments of these patients. The findings indicated that disruption
of an inhibitor of JAK-STAT signaling can phenocopy diseases that result
from activating mutations in these tyrosine kinases.

Lasho et al. (2010) reported 2 patients with somatic mutations in the
SH2B3 gene associated with isolated erythrocytosis: E208X and A215V,
respectively. Both mutations occurred in exon 2 and affected the PH
domain. Neither patient had other features of polycythemia vera (PV;
263300). Lasho et al. (2010) suggested that SH2B3 mutations may provide
the 'missing link' for JAK2-negative erythrocytosis or PV.

ANIMAL MODEL

Takaki et al. (2000) generated Lnk-deficient mice and found that
although they had unimpaired T-cell development in thymus, pre-B and
immature B cells accumulated in enlarged spleens. In bone marrow, there
was also an increase in B-lineage cells, reflecting enhanced production
of B-cell progenitors due in part to hypersensitivity to SCF (KITLG;
184745) in the presence or absence of IL7 (146660). Western blot
analysis showed that mouse Lnk is actually a 68-kD protein.

To determine whether Lnk might act as a physiologic negative regulator
of cytokine-induced HSC expansion, Buza-Vidas et al. (2006) analyzed HSC
expansion in Lnk -/- mice. They found that Lnk -/- HSCs continued to
expand postnatally, up to 24-fold above normal by 6 months of age.
Within the stem cell compartment, this expansion was highly selective
for self-renewing long-term HSCs, which showed enhanced Thpo
responsiveness. Lnk -/- HSC expansion was dependent on Thpo, and
12-week-old Lnk -/- Thpo -/- mice had 65-fold fewer long-term HSCs than
Lnk -/- mice. Expansions in multiple myeloid, but not lymphoid,
progenitors in Lnk -/- mice also proved to be Thpo-dependent.

In a patient with primary myelofibrosis (see 254450), Oh et al. (2010)
identified a somatic 5-bp deletion in the SC2B3 gene. The deletion was
predicted to result in the absence of both the PH and SH2 domains. In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the truncating mutant
was unable to inhibit TPO (600044)-mediated growth.

gene. The mutation occurred in the PH domain. In vitro functional

the ability to inhibit TPO (600044)-mediated growth.

of the SH2B3 gene. The patient did not have other features of
polycythemia vera.

179590	TITLE *179590 PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, RECEPTOR-TYPE, F; PTPRF
;;RECEPTOR-LINKED PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE LAR;;
LEUKOCYTE ANTIGEN-RELATED TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE; LAR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The LAR (PTPRF) gene encodes a membrane protein that has a cytoplasmic
domain with homology to protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (176885) and an
extracellular domain homologous to the neural cellular adhesion molecule
NCAM (116930).

CLONING

The human LAR molecule closely resembles cell adhesion molecules, which
suggests that it may be involved in the regulation of phosphotyrosine
levels through cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. As a first step
toward site-directed mutagenesis studies of LAR function, Schaapveld et
al. (1995) characterized the mouse Ptprf gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schaapveld et al. (1995) found that the cytoplasmic region of the mouse
Ptprf gene is encoded by 11 exons that span only 4.5 kb of genomic DNA.
Compared to the known exon-intron structures of other mammalian
receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase genes such as Ptpra (encoding
LRP; 176884) and Ptprc (coding for Ly-5; 151460), the portion of the
Ptprf gene encoding the cytoplasmic region of murine LAR contained not
only smaller, but also fewer introns.

O'Grady et al. (1994) demonstrated that the human LAR gene is composed
of 33 exons spanning over 85 kb. Exon 2 encodes the signal sequence and
the first 4 amino acids in the mature LAR protein. The 3
immunoglobulin-like domains are encoded by exons 3 to 7, and the 8
fibronectin type III (FN-III) domains by exons 8 to 17. Exons 18 to 22
encode the juxtamembrane and transmembrane domains, and exons 23 to 33
encode the 2 conserved tyrosine phosphatase domains and the entire
3-prime untranslated region. Alternative splicing of LAR mRNA was
revealed by RT-PCR analysis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Ahmad and Goldstein (1997) reported that LAR is synthesized as an
approximately 200-kD protein that is proteolytically processed into 2
noncovalently associated subunits: a 150-kD extracellular (E) subunit
that contains the cell adhesion molecule domains, and an 85-kD
phosphatase (P) subunit that contains extracellular, transmembrane, and
cytoplasmic domains. Ahmad and Goldstein (1997) carried out several
studies to elucidate the relationship between LAR and the insulin
signaling pathway. They demonstrated that anti-LAR antibodies inhibit
the activity of overexpressed human insulin receptor (147670) in Chinese
hamster ovary cells. Immunoprecipitation of LAR from cell lysates and
immunoblotting with antibody to the insulin receptor (or vice versa)
showed a physical association between LAR and the insulin receptor. In
insulin-stimulated rat liver cells, LAR was temporally internalized into
a similar endosomal compartment as the insulin receptor. Ahmad and
Goldstein (1997) concluded that LAR acts as a protein-tyrosine
phosphatase that negatively regulates the insulin signaling pathway.

Nam et al. (1999) determined the crystal structure of the tandem D1 and
D2 domains of the human LAR.

Most receptor-like transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases)
such as CD45 and the PTPRF molecule have 2 tandemly repeated PTPase
domains in the cytoplasmic segment. Tsujikawa et al. (2001) examined the
function of each PTPase domain of PTPRF in vivo using a potential
physiologic substrate, insulin receptor, and PTPRF mutant proteins.
PTPRF associated with and preferentially dephosphorylated the insulin
receptor that was tyrosine phosphorylated by insulin stimulation. Its
association was mediated by PTPase domain 2, because the cys1813-to-ser
mutation in domain 2 resulted in weakening of the association. The
cys1522-to-ser mutant protein, which is defective in the PTPRF PTPase
domain 1 catalytic site, was tightly associated with
tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor, but failed to dephosphorylate
it, indicating that PTPRF PTPase domain 1 is critical for
dephosphorylation of tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor. The
authors concluded that each domain of PTPRF plays distinct functional
roles through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in vivo.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Disteche et al. (1989) mapped the LAR gene to
1p34-p32. The related leukocyte common antigen (LCA, also known as CD45;
151460) also maps to chromosome 1. By in situ hybridization, Jirik et
al. (1992) mapped LAR, a putative tumor suppressor gene, to 1p32, a
region frequently deleted in human neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma.
By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Schaapveld et al. (1995) mapped
the Ptprf gene to mouse chromosome 4. Harder et al. (1995) found that
coamplification of the PTPRF gene and the MYCL1 gene (164850) in a small
cell lung cancer line supported close linkage of the 2 genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wang et al. (2004) performed mutation analysis of the tyrosine
phosphatase gene superfamily in human cancers and identified 83 somatic
mutations in 6 protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPRF; PTPRG, 176886;
PTPRT, 608712; PTPN3, 176877; PTPN13, 600267; and PTPN14, 603155),
affecting 26% of colorectal cancers and a smaller fraction of lung,
breast, and gastric cancers. Fifteen mutations were nonsense,
frameshift, or splice site alterations predicted to result in truncated
proteins lacking phosphatase activity. Wang et al. (2004) biochemically
examined 5 missense mutations in PTPRT, the most commonly altered
protein-tyrosine phosphatase, and found that they reduced phosphatase
activity. Expression of wildtype but not a mutant PTPRT in human cancer
cells inhibited cell growth. Wang et al. (2004) concluded that their
observations suggested that the mutated tyrosine phosphatases are tumor
suppressor genes, regulating cellular pathways that may be amenable to
therapeutic intervention.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schaapveld et al. (1997) used gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem
cells to generate mice lacking sequences encoding both Lar phosphatase
domains. Homozygous mutant mice developed and grew normally. However,
mammary glands of homozygous Lar-deficient females were incapable of
delivering milk due to an impaired terminal differentiation of alveoli
at late pregnancy. The authors concluded that LAR-mediated signaling may
play an important role in mammary gland development and function.

Uetani et al. (2009) obtained late Ptprs (601576)/Ptprf double-knockout
mouse embryos at the expected mendelian ratio, but none survived to 4
weeks of age, likely due to lethality of Ptprs knockout. At embryonic
day 18.5, double-knockout embryos showed severe craniofacial defects,
including exencephaly, micrognathia, and failure of eyelid closure.
Additional malformation of the eye included hyperplastic inner nuclear
layers, persistence of prominent hyaloid arteries, abnormal retrolental
tissues, and disorganized neural retina. Double-knockout embryos also
showed striking abnormalities of the urinary tract, such as
hydroureters, hydronephrosis, duplicated ureter/renal systems, and
ureterocele. Absence of Ptprs and Ptprf activity prevented normal
execution of the apoptotic program necessary for regression of the
common nephric duct during development, resulting in inappropriate
tissue survival and delayed distal ureter maturation. In cell culture,
Ptprs bound and negatively regulated the phosphorylation and signaling
of the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase (164761), whereas Ptprs-induced
apoptosis was inhibited by Ret expression. Uetani et al. (2009)
concluded that ureter positioning is controlled by the opposing actions
of RET and LAR family phosphatases regulating apoptosis-mediated tissue
morphogenesis.

611023	TITLE *611023 tRNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 5, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; TRMT5
;;TRM5;;
KIAA1393
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

tRNAs contain as many as 13 or 14 nucleotides that are modified
posttranscriptionally by enzymes that are highly specific for particular
nucleotides in the tRNA structure. TRMT5 methylates the N1 position of
guanosine-37 (G37) in selected tRNAs using S-adenosyl methionine (Brule
et al., 2004).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned TRMT5, which they called KIAA1393.
The deduced protein contains 500 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected
moderate to high expression of TRMT5 in all adult and fetal tissues
examined, with highest expression in ovary, followed by testis, spinal
cord, and liver. Moderate to high expression of TRMT5 was present in all
specific brain regions examined, with highest expression in corpus
callosum.

By searching databases for homologs of yeast Trm5, Brule et al. (2004)
identified human TRMT5, which they called TRM5. The predicted protein
contains 509 amino acids. Recombinant TRM5 had an apparent molecular
mass of 60.5 kD by SDS-PAGE. Bioinformatic analysis identified TRM5
homologs in eukaryotes and archaea; however, no significant homologies
were identified in prokaryotes, including the TrmD gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Brule et al. (2004) found that, unlike its bacterial counterpart, TrmD,
recombinant human TRM5 methylated G37 regardless of which nucleotide was
present at position 36. Human TRM5 also methylated inosine at position
37, unlike TrmD. TRM5 did not have an absolute requirement for magnesium
ions and appeared to function as a monomer.

GENE STRUCTURE

Brule et al. (2004) determined that the TRMT5 gene contains 5 exons and
spans 11 kb.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the TRMT5 gene to chromosome 14 by radiation
hybrid analysis. By genomic sequence analysis, Brule et al. (2004)
mapped the TRMT5 gene to chromosome 14q23.1.

MALAT1-ASSOCIATED SMALL CYTOPLASMIC RNA, INCLUDED; MASCRNA, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Alpha gene was identified by James et al. (1994) and by Guru et al.
(1997). It is unusual in that it is very AT-rich, transcribed in an
intronless fashion, and contains no ORF of significant length.

By subtractive hybridization to identify genes upregulated in aggressive
nonsmall cell lung cancer, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Ji et
al. (2003) cloned 2 splice variants of MALAT1. The transcripts have
putative open reading frames for peptides of about 50 amino acids, but
no translation start sites have Kozak sequences. No MALAT1 protein was
synthesized in an in vitro translation system. Northern blot analysis
detected a MALAT1 transcript in human lung carcinoma cell lines.
Real-time RT-PCR detected variable MALAT1 expression in normal tissues,
with highest expression in pancreas and lung. MALAT1 homologs in several
mammalian EST databases showed a high degree of sequence conservation.

Using expression arrays to identify polyadenylated RNAs displaying
nuclear enrichment in human cell lines, Hutchinson et al. (2007)
identified XIST (314670), NEAT1 (NCRNA00084; 612769), and MALAT1, which
they called NEAT2. Like NEAT1, NEAT2 is a large, infrequently spliced
noncoding RNA, but it shares no sequence identity with NEAT1. Northern
blot analysis detected broad expression of a NEAT2 transcript of over 6
kb, with highest expression in ovary, prostate, and colon. Hutchinson et
al. (2007) also cloned mouse Neat2, and Northern blot analysis detected
a broadly expressed transcript of about 7 kb in mouse tissues. Neat2
orthologs were conserved within multiple mammalian species, but not in
nonmammalian species. RNA FISH analysis confirmed nuclear enrichment of
NEAT1 and NEAT2 in human and mouse cell lines. Both proteins localized
with SC35 (SFRS2; 600813) at nuclear speckles, although NEAT2 was more
centrally located and NEAT1 more peripherally located.

Wilusz et al. (2008) identified mascRNA, a highly conserved
61-nucleotide RNA that originates from the 3-prime end of the human
MALAT1 transcript. The mascRNA transcript was predicted to fold into a
tRNA-like cloverleaf. It terminates in a CCA motif, which is not encoded
in the genome and is a hallmark of the 3-prime ends of tRNAs and similar
structures. However, the predicted anticodon loop of mascRNA is poorly
conserved, and mascRNA was not aminoacylated in HeLa cells. Like the
mature 7-kb MALAT1 transcript, Northern blot analysis detected mascRNA
expression in all human tissues and cell lines examined. Northern blot
analysis of fractionated mouse cells showed that Malat1 localized to the
nucleus, whereas mascRNA localized to the cytoplasm in mouse cells and
HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Ji et al. (2003) found that MALAT1 was one of several genes whose
expression was increased in nonsmall cell lung cancers prior to
metastasizing. MALAT1 expression was associated with cancers in a stage-
and histology-specific manner. Ji et al. (2003) suggested that MALAT1
expression may be a prognostic parameter for patient survival in stage I
nonsmall cell lung cancer.

Wilusz et al. (2008) found that RNase P (see 606116) cleaved the nascent
MALAT1 transcript downstream of a genomically encoded poly(A)-rich tract
to simultaneously generate the poly(A) 3-prime end of the mature MALAT1
transcript and the 5-prime end of mascRNA. RNase Z (see ELAC2; 605367)
processed the 3-prime end of mascRNA, followed by the addition of the
CCA motif. Wilusz et al. (2008) also found that the nuclear MALAT1
transcript was stabilized by U-rich motifs, whereas cytoplasmic mascRNA
had a relatively short half-life.

MAPPING

The Alpha gene maps near the multiple endocrine neoplasia type-1 locus
(MEN1; 131100) on chromosome 11q13, a region implicated in chromosomal
abnormalities of various tumors (James et al., 1994; Guru et al., 1997;
van Asseldonk et al., 2000).

Hutchinson et al. (2007) determined that the MALAT1 and NCRNA00084 genes
are less than 70 kb apart on chromosome 11q13.1. They mapped the mouse
Malat1 gene to a region of chromosome 19A that shares homology of
synteny with human chromosome 11q13.1.

CYTOGENETICS

Davis et al. (2003) cloned an Alpha/TFEB (600744) fusion gene in renal
tumors harboring a t(6;11)(p21.1;q13) translocation. They found that the
Alpha gene was rearranged with the first intron of TFEB, just upstream
of TFEB's initiation ATG, preserving the entire TFEB coding sequence.

Kuiper et al. (2003) collected 3 cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC;
605074) from patients 14 to 42 years of age, wherein a t(6;11)(p21;q13)
translocation was the sole cytogenetic abnormality. Molecular analysis
revealed fusion of the TFEB gene on chromosome 6 to the Alpha gene on
chromosome 11. The Alpha/TFEB fusion gene linked all coding exons of the
TFEB gene to 5-prime upstream regulatory sequences of the Alpha gene.
Alpha/TFEB mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in primary tumor
cells as compared with wildtype TFEB mRNA levels in normal kidney
samples, resulting in a dramatic upregulation of TFEB protein levels.
The TFEB protein encoded by the Alpha/TFEB fusion gene was efficiently
targeted to the nucleus. Kuiper et al. (2003) speculated that this
resulted in severely unbalanced nuclear ratios of MITF (156845)/TFE
subfamily members and that this imbalance may lead to changes in the
expression of downstream target genes, ultimately resulting in the
development of RCC.

190230	TITLE *190230 TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR, BETA-3; TGFB3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Beta-type transforming growth factors are polypeptides that act
hormonally to control the proliferation and differentiation of multiple
cell types. A cDNA clone for a third form of TGFB was isolated by ten
Dijke et al. (1988). The C-terminal 112 amino acids of TGF-beta-3 share
approximately 80% sequence identity with beta-1 (190180) and beta-2
(190220).

Moren et al. (1992) isolated full-length cDNAs for TGFB3 from a human
placenta cDNA library. The coding region encoded a protein of 849 amino
acids with a single transmembrane domain and a short stretch of the
intracellular domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Graycar et al. (1989) purified to apparent homogeneity human TGFB3 and
evaluated its activities in comparison to TGFB1 and TGFB2.

Lee and Nowak (2001) compared expression of the TGFB isoforms in normal
myometrium and benign leiomyoma tumors of the uterus (150699) and
examined the effects of TGFBs on cell proliferation and collagen
production by these cells in vitro. Northern blot analysis showed that
the levels of TGFB1 mRNA were similar between leiomyoma and myometrium,
whereas leiomyoma showed 5-fold higher levels of expression of TGFB3
mRNA than autologous myometrium. Expression of TGFB3 protein detected by
immunohistochemistry was much more intense in leiomyoma tissues than in
corresponding myometrium. The authors concluded that their results
support the hypothesis that alterations in the TGFB system produce loss
of sensitivity to the antiproliferative effects of TGFB, and increased
expression of TGFB3 may contribute to the growth of these tumors.

Epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT) of the medial edge
epithelial seam creates palatal confluence. Nawshad and Hay (2003)
showed that Tgfb3 brought about palatal seam EMT in mice by stimulating
expression of Lef1 (153245) in medial edge epithelial cells. Tgfb3
activated Lef1 in the absence of beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806) via
nuclear phospho-Smad2 (601366) and Smad4 (600993).

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of DNA prepared from somatic cell hybrids and by in
situ hybridization, ten Dijke et al. (1988) assigned the TGFB3 gene to
chromosome 14q23-q24. Barton et al. (1988) likewise assigned the TGFB3
gene to chromosome 14 and regionalized it to 14q24 by Southern blot
analysis of hybrid cell DNAs and by in situ hybridization.

The mouse Tgfb3 gene was mapped to chromosome 12 (Barton et al., 1988;
Dickinson et al., 1990).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Beffagna et al. (2005) screened 38 members of a 4-generation Italian
family with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia-1 (ARVD1;
107970), previously reported by Rampazzo et al. (2003), and identified a
mutation (190230.0001) in the 5-prime UTR of the TGFB3 gene. Subsequent
screening of 30 unrelated individuals with ARVD1 led to the
identification of an additional mutation (190230.0002) in the 3-prime
UTR of the TGFB3 gene in 1 patient. In transfection studies, both
mutations showed significantly higher luciferase reporter activity
(about 2.5-fold, p less than 0.01) compared to wildtype.

In a case-control study of 711 Japanese individuals with ossification of
the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine (OPLL; 602475) and 896
controls, Horikoshi et al. (2006) found an association between an
intronic SNP in the TGFB3 gene (dbSNP rs2268624) and OPLL.

ANIMAL MODEL

Proetzel et al. (1995) produced Tgfb3-null mice in which exon 6 of the
Tgfb3 gene was replaced by the neomycin-resistance gene. Whereas
heterozygotes had no apparent phenotypic change, homozygotes had an
incompletely penetrant failure of the palatal shelves to fuse, leading
to cleft palate. The defect appeared to result from impaired adhesion of
the apposing medial edge epithelial of the palatal shelves and
subsequent elimination of the midline epithelial seam. No craniofacial
abnormalities were observed. Defective palatogenesis was also found in
homozygous Tgfb3-null mutant mice by Kaartinen et al. (1995) who also
found a consistent delay in pulmonary development. They suggested that
the study demonstrates an essential function for TGF-beta-3 in normal
palate and lung morphogenesis and implicates this cytokine in
epithelial-mesenchymal interaction.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ARRHYTHMOGENIC RIGHT VENTRICULAR DYSPLASIA 1
TGFB3, -36G-A, 5-PRIME UTR

In 9 affected and 3 unaffected members of a 4-generation Italian family
with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia-1 (ARVD1; 107970)
previously reported by Rampazzo et al. (2003), Beffagna et al. (2005)
identified a G-to-A transition at cDNA position -36 in the 5-prime UTR
of the TGFB3 gene. In transfection studies, the mutant construct showed
significantly higher luciferase reporter activity (about 2.5-fold, p
less than 0.01) compared to wildtype constructs. All clinically affected
members of the family had the mutation; Beffagna et al. (2005) stated
that detection of the mutation in 3 apparently healthy individuals was
consistent with reduced penetrance.

.0002
ARRHYTHMOGENIC RIGHT VENTRICULAR DYSPLASIA 1
TGFB3, 1723C-T, 3-PRIME UTR

In a young man with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia-1 (ARVD1;
107970), Beffagna et al. (2005) identified a C-to-T transition at cDNA
position 1723 in the 3-prime UTR of the TGFB3 gene. In transfection
studies, the mutant construct showed significantly higher luciferase
reporter activity (about 2.5-fold, p less than 0.01) compared to
wildtype constructs. The patient had a brother who died suddenly at the
age of 16 and was found to have ARVD at autopsy.

;;PCAF-ASSOCIATED FACTOR 65 ALPHA; PAF65A;;
PCAF-ASSOCIATED FACTOR, 65-KD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ogryzko et al. (1998) identified the human polypeptide PAF65A as a
subunit of the PCAF complex (see 602303). PAF65A shows sequence
similarity to human TAFII80 (602955). The predicted 622-amino acid
protein contains a histone H4-like region (residues 12-86).

GENE FUNCTION

Struhl and Moqtaderi (1998) reviewed the potential roles of the PCAF
complex in transcription.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the TAF6L gene to chromosome 11q12.3 based on an
alignment of the TAF6L sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF069735) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MICROSPHERULE PROTEIN, 58-KD, INCLUDED; MSP58, INCLUDED;;
MICROSPHERULE PROTEIN 2, INCLUDED; MCRS2, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 protein ICP22 as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, followed by screening a
HeLa cell cDNA library, Bruni and Roizman (1998) cloned MCRS1, which
they designated p78. The deduced 534-amino acid protein contains
potential nuclear localization signals in its N-terminal half and a
leucine zipper region in its C-terminal half. Western blot analysis
detected a major p78 doublet at about 78 kD and minor bands at about 62
and 55 kD. In vitro transcription-translation of p78 cDNA resulted in a
55-kD protein, suggesting that the bands at 78 kD represent highly
modified proteins. Western blot analysis of synchronized HeLa cells
detected p78 expression only in early S phase. It was not expressed in
nondividing HeLa cells or human foreskin fibroblasts. Immunolocalization
of p78 in HeLa cells detected the protein predominantly in nuclei.
However, in Hep-2 liver carcinoma cells, p78 localized to both nuclei
and cytoplasm, and in HSV-infected Hep-2 cells, it localized in a few
dense nuclear bodies or at the nuclear membrane.

By yeast 2-hybrid screening using NOL1 (164031) as bait, followed by PCR
of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Ren et al. (1998) cloned MSP58. The deduced
462-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 51.8 kD and
shares 96.8% amino acid identity with mouse Msp58. The N-terminal half
of MSP58 contains a serine-rich region, a nucleolar localization signal,
and a monopartite nuclear localization signal, and the C-terminal half
contains a coiled-coil region. Northern blot analysis detected a major
1.9-kb MSP58 transcript in all 8 tissues examined, with highest
expression in testis and lowest expression in colon. Western blot
analysis detected a 58-kD MSP58 protein in fractionated HeLa cell
nucleoli. Double-immunolabeling experiments found MSP58 within nucleolar
microspherules, where it colocalized with fibrillarin (FBL; 134795).

Using the telomerase-inhibitory protein LPTS (PINX1; 606505) as bait in
a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a brain cDNA library, Song et al. (2004)
cloned an MCRS1 variant that they designated MCRS2. The deduced MCRS2
protein contains 475 amino acids. Song et al. (2004) determined that the
MCRS1/p78, MSP58, and MCRS2 proteins differ only in their N termini and
are likely the products of variable spliced transcripts. All 3 isoforms
have a C-terminal forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, which mediates
protein-protein interactions and is associated with transcriptional
regulation, DNA repair, and cell-cycle progression. PCR analysis
detected MCRS1 and MCRS2 expression in brain and liver cDNA libraries. A
human hepatoma cell line expressed MCRS2 protein only in early S phase.

GENE FUNCTION

Bruni and Roizman (1998) found that p78 interacted specifically with the
HSV-1 protein ICP22 in nuclear extracts prepared from HSV-infected HeLa
cells.

Using truncation mutants in a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Ren et al. (1998)
determined that the C-terminal half of MCRS1 contains the NOL1-binding
site. Overexpression of MSP58 in COS-7 cells caused a 15-fold increase
in nucleolar volume. Inhibition of pre-rRNA transcription by actinomycin
D caused a relocalization of MSP58 from nucleolar microspherules to
'caps' containing the fibrillar centers. ELISA of sucrose density
fractions of HeLa cell nuclear extracts demonstrated comigration of
MSP58, fibrillarin, and NOL1 in nucleolar particulates.

Lin and Shih (2002) found that MSP58 interacted with DAXX (603186), an
adaptor protein associated with FAS (TNFRSF6; 134637) signaling and
caspase-independent cell death. DAXX interacted with MSP58 in vitro and
in vivo, and MSP58 overexpression correlated with sequestration of DAXX
from a diffuse nuclear distribution to the nucleolus. MSP58
overexpression relieved DAXX-mediated transcriptional repression. Lin
and Shih (2002) concluded that translocation of the MSP58-DAXX complex
to the nucleolus results in derepression of DAXX-regulated genes.

By in vitro pull-down assays, Song et al. (2004) confirmed an
interaction between MCRS2 and LPTS. The 2 proteins colocalized in
transfected cells, particularly in nucleoli and more weakly at telomere
speckles. The N-terminal 216 amino acids of MCRS2 were sufficient to
direct telomere localization. Overexpression of this MCRS2 N-terminal
region in a hepatoma cell line caused progressive shortening of
telomeres during passage, whereas control cells maintained telomere
length. Song et al. (2004) found that MCRS2 also associated with TERT
(187270) and inhibited telomerase activity in vitro in a
concentration-dependent manner.

By immunoprecipitation analysis, Shimono et al. (2005) found that MCRS1
interacted with MI2-beta (CHD4; 603277), RFP (TRIM27; 602165), and UBF
(UBTF; 600673). Yeast 2-hybrid screening showed that the central region
of MCRS1 interacted with the ATPase/helicase region of MI2-beta and the
coiled-coil region of RFP. Confocal microscopy demonstrated
colocalization of MCRS1, MI2-beta, RFP, and UBF in nucleoli. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays showed that MCRS1, MI2-beta, and RFP
associated with rDNA and were involved in transactivation of ribosomal
gene transcription, which could be downregulated by small interfering
RNA-mediated downregulation of MCRS1, MI2-beta, and RFP. Shimono et al.
(2005) concluded that MI2-beta and RFP, which are involved in
transcriptional repression in the nucleus, associate with MCRS1 in the
nucleolus and are involved in activation of rRNA transcription.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MCRS1
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP RH77809).

605482	TITLE *605482 GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE, OMEGA-1; GSTO1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The glutathione S-transferases (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) are a family of
enzymes responsible for the metabolism of a broad range of xenobiotics
and carcinogens (Mannervik, 1985). This enzyme catalyzes the reaction of
glutathione with a wide variety of organic compounds to form thioethers,
a reaction that is sometimes a first step in a detoxification process
leading to mercapturic acid formation.

Based on amino acid sequence similarities and antibody
cross-reactivities, the mammalian cytosolic GSTs are divided into
several classes, including alpha (e.g., 138359), mu (e.g., 138350),
kappa (602321), theta (e.g., 600436), pi (134660), omega, and zeta
(603758). In addition, there is a class of microsomal GSTs (e.g.,
138330).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologies with GSTZ1 (603758), Board
et al. (2000) identified a cDNA encoding GSTO1, the first member of the
omega GST class. The deduced 241-amino acid protein has over 70%
identity with the rodent omega GST sequences. Of the previously defined
GST classes, the omega GSTS are most similar to the zeta class. The
omega class GSTs possess a 19- to 20-residue N-terminal extension, not
observed in other GSTs, that abuts the C terminus to form a novel
structural unit. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression
of a 0.8-kb GSTO1 transcript, with highest expression in liver, skeletal
muscle, and heart, and lowest expression in brain, placenta, and lung.
Board et al. (2000) noted that the ubiquitous expression of GSTO1
contrasts with the tissue-specific expression typical of many GSTs.
Western blot analysis of cytosolic extracts and recombinant protein
showed that GSTO1 is expressed as a 31-kD protein in its monomeric form.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Cystral Structure

Crystal structure analysis of GSTO1 by Board et al. (2000) demonstrated
that GSTO1 has an N-terminal thioredoxin-like domain consisting of a
central 4-stranded beta sheet flanked on one side by 2 alpha helices and
on the other by a 3-10 helix. The C terminus is composed of 7 alpha
helices and makes several H bonds with the N-terminal domain. GSTO1
forms a dimer and adopts the typical GST tertiary structure.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analyses by Board et al. (2000) showed that GSTO1 lacks
activity with most GST substrates but exhibits glutathione-dependent
thiol transferase and dehydroascorbate reductase activity characteristic
of the glutaredoxins (e.g., GLRX, 600443). Whitbread et al. (2003)
stated that GSTO1 also reduces monomethylarsonic acid to
monomethylarsonous acid, which is the rate-limiting step in the
biotransformation of inorganic arsenic.

Kim et al. (2012) found that the Gsto1a and Gsto1b isoforms of
Drosophila Gsto1 had distinct physiologic activities. Gsto1b protected
flies against oxidative stress, whereas Gsto1a increased mitochondrial
ATPase synthase complex assembly and activity by glutathionylation of
the ATP synthase beta subunit (ATP5B; 102910). Overexpression of Gsto1a
partially reversed the phenotype of parkin (PARK2; 602544) mutant files,
including degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and muscle, cellular
tubulin (see 602529) accumulation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Kim
et al. (2012) concluded that Drosophila Gsto1 plays a protective role in
parkin mutants by regulating mitochondrial ATP synthase activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Whitbread et al. (2003) determined that the GSTO1 gene contains 6 exons
and spans 12.5 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH and somatic cell hybrid analyses, Whitbread et al. (2003) mapped
the GSTO1 gene to chromosome 10q24-q25, about 7.5-kb upstream of the
GSTO2 gene (612314). Whitbread et al. (2003) also identified an apparent
GSTO1-related pseudogene on chromosome 3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By database analysis, Whitbread et al. (2003) identified several
putative polymorphisms in the coding region of GSTO1 and confirmed 11 of
these by reexamining the cDNA sequences. They identified 2 of the
polymorphisms in their study population (100 European Australians, 62
Bantu Africans, and 100 Southern Chinese). One was a 419C-T transition
resulting in an ala140-to-asp (A140D) substitution; the frequency of the
D140 allele was notably different between the groups, being highest in
Australians and lowest in Africans. The other was a rare splicing
polymorphism at IVS4, resulting in deletion of glu155 (E155del). Only 1
Chinese individual was homozygous for the deletion. In vitro assays
showed that the A140D substitution had no effect on the thioltransferase
and GSH-conjugation activity of GSTO1, whereas E155del polymorphism
resulted in significantly higher GSTO1 activity in both assays. The
E155del variant also showed lower thermal stability than the other
variants.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kim et al. (2012) found that knockdown of Gsto1 in Drosophila resulted
in no obvious defects in adult morphology. However, mutant flies were
sensitive to paraquat, an oxidative stress inducer. Double mutation of
parkin and Gsto1a accentuated the phenotype of parkin mutant flies, with
dramatically enhanced degeneration of indirect flight muscles.

DESCRIPTION

CKMT1A is a nearly identical copy of the CKMT1B gene (123290). Both
genes encode an identical CKMT1 protein (Zhang et al., 2007).

CLONING

Zhang et al. (2007) stated that CKMT1A differs from CKMT1B by only 2
nucleotides. The CKMT1A and CKMT1B proteins are identical, and both
appear to be functional.

MAPPING

Zhang et al. (2007) reported that the CKMT1A gene is telomeric to the
CKMT1B gene on chromosome 15q15.

;;GLUCOSAMINE-6-SULFATASE; G6S
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Freeman et al. (1987) reported purification and characterization of
N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.14), which hydrolyzes heparan
sulfate and keratan sulfate. They identified 4 forms of the enzyme in
liver, which were postulated to be due to differences in the state of
processing of a large subunit. The catalytic properties were studied by
Freeman and Hopwood (1987). Using sequences obtained by direct
N-terminal amino acid sequencing of G6S isoforms, Robertson et al.
(1988) designed oligonucleotide probes to screen a liver cDNA library.
The longest clone obtained encoded a deduced 375-amino acid protein
representing form A of G6S. They also identified a clone that represents
the 331-amino acid form B of G6S. Robertson et al. (1988) determined
that the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 78-kD form A species and
the 32-kD form B species are identical, indicating that the 78-kD form A
polypeptide is processed by internal peptidase cleavage to a 32-kD
N-terminal species and a 48-kD C-terminal species. Full-length G6S
contains several N-glycosylation sites and a hydrophilic region, rich in
basic amino acids, that may represent the proteolytic cleavage site.

Dhoot et al. (2001) reported the identification of QSulf1, an avian
ortholog of GNS. QSulf1 expression is induced by Sonic hedgehog in
myogenic somite progenitors in quail embryos and is required for the
activation of MyoD (159970), a Wnt (see 164820)-induced regulator of
muscle specification. QSulf1 is localized on the cell surface and
regulates heparan-dependent Wnt signaling in C2C12 myogenic progenitor
cells through a mechanism that requires its catalytic activity,
providing evidence that QSulf1 regulates Wnt signaling through
desulfation of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans.

MAPPING

Robertson et al. (1988) assigned the glucosamine-6-sulfatase gene, which
they symbolized G6S, to chromosome 12q14 by in situ hybridization of a
tritium-labeled G6S cDNA probe. The localization was confirmed by using
the cDNA clone in 7 analyses of DNA from human/mouse hybrid cell lines.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mok et al. (2003) amplified and sequenced the promoter and 14 exons of
the GNS gene from a patient with mucopolysaccharidosis type IIID
(252940) and identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 9,
predicted to result in premature termination at codon 355 (607664.0001).
They also identified 2 common synonymous coding SNPs and genotyped these
in samples from 4 ethnic groups.

Independently, Beesley et al. (2003) identified a 1-bp deletion in the
GNS gene (607664.0002) in a patient with Sanfilippo disease
(mucopolysaccharidosis) type D.

Elcioglu et al. (2009) reported a 10-year-old Turkish boy with
Sanfilippo syndrome type D, in whom they identified homozygosity for a
1-bp insertion in the GNS gene (607664.0005). The authors stated that
this was the twenty-first patient and the eighth mutation reported for
the disease.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIID
GNS, ARG355TER

In the fibroblast cell line of the 7-year-old East Indian boy with
mucopolysaccharidosis type IIID (252940) described by Kresse et al.
(1980), Mok et al. (2003) identified a homozygous 1063C-T transition in
exon 9 of the GNS gene, predicting a premature termination of
translation at codon 355 (R355X).

.0002
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIID
GNS, 1-BP DEL, 1169A

In a patient with mucopolysaccharidosis type IIID (252940), Beesley et
al. (2003) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion, 1169delA, in the
GNS gene. The mutation was predicted to cause a frameshift and premature
termination of the protein. The patient was the offspring of
first-cousin parents from Pakistan. He presented at 3 years of age, at
which time he was very 'lively' and examination was difficult as he was
very fractious. He had a hirsute facies and his facial features were
coarse. He had a large head with frontal bossing, a low nasal bridge,
and a tendency to hypertelorism. His tongue and hands were large. There
was no hepatosplenomegaly or audible murmurs. A skeletal survey was
consistent with a mucopolysaccharidosis.

.0003
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIID
GNS, GLN390TER

In 2 Italian Canadian brothers with mucopolysaccharidosis type IIID
(252940), originally reported by Kaplan and Wolfe (1987), Jansen et al.
(2007) identified a homozygous 1168C-T transition in exon 10 of the GNS
gene, resulting in a gln390-to-ter (Q390X) substitution. Each unaffected
parent was heterozygous for the mutation.

.0004
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIID
GNS, 5-BP INS, 1138GTCCT

In a 15-year-old Turkish English girl with mucopolysaccharidosis type
IIID (252940), Jansen et al. (2007) identified a homozygous 5-bp
insertion (1138insGTCCT) in exon 10 of the GNS gene, resulting in a
frameshift and premature termination of the protein at residue 389. She
was severely retarded and fully dependent on assistance for all
activities of daily living.

.0005
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIID
GNS, 1-BP INS, 1226G

In a 10-year-old Turkish boy with mucopolysaccharidosis type IIID
(252940), Elcioglu et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp
insertion (1226insG) in exon 11 of the GNS gene, predicted to cause a
frameshift and premature termination with loss of the C terminus. The
boy's parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in
100 controls.

191350	TITLE *191350 DOLICHYL-PHOSPHATE N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINE PHOSPHOTRANSFERASE; DPAGT1
;;UDP-GlcNAc:DOLICHYL-PHOSPHATE N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINEPHOSPHOTRANSFERASE;;
DPAGT2;;
GlcNAc-1-P TRANSFERASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

N-linked glycosylation is initiated in all eukaryotic cells with the
synthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides in a cyclic pathway, the
dolichol cycle. DPAGT1 (EC 2.7.8.15) catalyzes the first step in the
dolichol cycle, the synthesis of
N-acetylglucosaminyl-pyrophosphoryldolichol (GlcNAc-PP-dolichol) from
dolichol phosphate and UDP-GlcNAc, and can be inhibited by the
antibiotic tunicamycin (Eckert et al., 1998).

CLONING

Rajput et al. (1992) isolated mRNA for the Dpagt1 protein from mouse
mammary glands. The mouse cDNA recognized a single mRNA species of about
2 kb in mouse mammary glands when used as a probe in Northern blot
analysis.

Eckert et al. (1998) cloned a human DPAGT1 cDNA from a human lung
fibroblast cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a deduced 400-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 44.7 kD. DPAGT1 contains an
N-terminal signal peptide, 2 potential dolichol-binding sequences, and 4
sites for N-glycosylation. It shares 93% amino acid homology with
hamster Dpagt, including 100% identity in the dolichol-binding region,
and 42% homology with S. cerevisiae GlcNAc-1-P transferase.

GENE FUNCTION

Protein asparagine-linked glycosylation is a multistep process that is
divided into 2 stages. The first stage consists of the synthesis of the
lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor (LLO) and its en bloc transfer to
nascent polypeptides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. This
process requires at least 34 genes, of which DPAGT1 is the first. The
second stage involves the processing of protein-bound oligosaccharides
and requires at least an additional 20 genes to form a bi-antennary
sugar chain typical of plasma glycoproteins. Genetic defects in some of
these genes, including DPAGT1, cause severe multisystem disorders called
congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) (Freeze, 2001)

Eckert et al. (1998) demonstrated that S. cerevisiae expressing
recombinant DPAGT1 synthesized GlcNAc- and GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol.
Expression of human DPAGT1 also complemented a conditional lethal S.
cerevisiae strain defective for GlcNAc-1-P transferase. Expression of
recombinant DPAGT1 from a multicopy expression vector also conferred a
higher tolerance toward tunicamycin due to elevated enzyme synthesis,
thus showing a gene dosage effect.

MAPPING

Using FISH and somatic cell hybrid analysis, Smith et al. (1993) mapped
the DPAGT1 gene (D11S366) to chromosome 11q23.3.

Using a panel of mouse/hamster somatic cell hybrids and a specific probe
derived from the 3-prime noncoding region of the mouse cDNA, Rajput et
al. (1992) mapped the mouse Dpagt1 gene to chromosome 17.

ANIMAL MODEL

Marek et al. (1999) found that Dpagt1-null mice died 4 to 5 days
postfertilization, just after implantation, suggesting that DPAGT1
function and protein N-glycosylation are essential in early
embryogenesis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Type Ij

In a patient with CDG Ij (CDGIJ; 608093), Wu et al. (2003) identified a
tyr170-to-cys mutation (Y170C; 191350.0001) in the DPAGT1 gene.

Timal et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations
in the DPAGT1 gene (191350.0007 and 191350.0008) in a Caucasian boy with
CDG Ij. The mutations were found by exome sequencing and confirmed by
Sanger sequencing.

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Turkish parents, with severe CDG Ij,
Wurde et al. (2012) identified a homozygous mutation in the DPAGT1 gene
(A114G; 191350.0009). The mutation was found by homozygosity mapping
followed by candidate gene sequencing. The unaffected parents were
heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 100 control
alleles of the same ethnic background. RT-PCR analysis of patient cells
showed that the mutation also increased the amount of normal aberrant
splicing seen in controls, resulting in the skipping of exons 2/3 and a
truncated protein. In vitro functional expression assays showed
decreased DPAGT1 activity, at 18% of normal values. The patients had a
severe disorder characterized by hyperexcitability, intractable
seizures, bilateral cataracts, nystagmus, strabismus, and progressive
microcephaly. Both died within their first year of life from
cardiorespiratory failure.

In a Pakistani brother and sister, born of unrelated patients with a
mild from of CDG Ij, Iqbal et al. (2013) identified compound
heterozygous mutations in the DPAGT1 gene (I29F; 191350.0010 and L168P;
191350.0011). The mutations were found by exome sequencing, confirmed by
Sanger sequencing, segregated with the disorder, and occurred at highly
conserved residues. Neither was present in over 200 ethnically matched
chromosomes, or in the dbSNP, 1000 Genomes, or Exome Variant Server
databases. Functional studies of the variants were not performed. The
patients had normal psychomotor development until ages 2 and 5 years,
respectively, when they both developed seizures, hypotonia, and
aggressive behavior. As adults, they had moderate intellectual
disability, poor speech, aggressive behavior, hypotonia, seizures, and
mild facial dysmorphic features.

- Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome With Tubular Aggregates 2

In 5 patients from 4 families with limb-girdle congenital myasthenic
syndrome with tubular aggregates-2 (CMSTA2; 614750), Belaya et al.
(2012) identified 7 different mutations in the DPAGT1 gene (see, e.g.,
191350.0002-191350.0006). All mutations were in the compound
heterozygous state. The first 4 mutations were identified by exome
sequencing of 2 unrelated patients and were confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. The mutations segregated with the disorder in those families
with available material. Analyses of motor endplates from 2 patients
showed a severe reduction of endplate acetylcholine receptors (AChR). In
vitro studies showed that DPAGT1 is required for efficient glycosylation
of AChR subunits and for efficient export of AChR receptors to the cell
surface. The findings demonstrated the importance of N-linked protein
glycosylation for proper functioning of the neuromuscular junction, and
suggested that the primary pathogenic mechanism of DPAGT1 mutations is
reduced levels of AChR at the endplate region. Laboratory studies of 2
patients showed abnormal glycosylation of transferrin, consistent with a
functional defect of DPAGT1. Belaya et al. (2012) postulated that the
defect in glycosylation of certain proteins may lead to misfolding and
aggregation in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in formation of
tubular aggregates within muscle tissue.

NOMENCLATURE

GPT has been used as an abbreviation for this enzyme, but this runs the
risk of confusion with glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT; 138200).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CONGENITAL DISORDER OF GLYCOSYLATION, TYPE Ij
DPAGT1, TYR170CYS

In a patient with CDG Ij (CDG1J, 608093), Wu et al. (2003) identified
reduced DPAGT1 enzymatic activity; sequencing of genomic DNA and cDNAs
of the DPAGT1 gene identified, in the paternal allele, a 660A-G
transition in exon 5, resulting in a tyr170-to-cys (Y170C) mutation.
Although no mutation was identified in the maternal allele, it produced
only 12% of the normal amount of mature mRNA; the remainder showed a
complex exon skipping pattern that shifted the reading frame and
resulted in a truncated nonfunctional protein. The patient had developed
infantile spasms at the age of 4 months within 72 hours of receiving DPT
immunization. Development was significantly delayed in all aspects with
microcephaly, arched palate, micrognathia, and exotropia. She also had
fifth finger clinodactyly, single flexion creases of the hands, and skin
dimples on the upper thighs. She had severe hypotonia and medically
intractable seizures, and at 6 years of age had minimal speech. Abnormal
isoelectric focusing pattern of serum transferrin was consistent with
the diagnosis of type I CDG.

MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, WITH TUBULAR AGGREGATES 2
DPAGT1, VAL117ILE

In a patient with congenital myasthenic syndrome with tubular
aggregates-2 (CMSTA2; 614750), Belaya et al. (2012) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the DPAGT1 gene: a 349G-A transition
resulting in a val117-to-ile (V117I) substitution, and a 324G-C
transversion resulting in a met108-to-ile (M108I; 191350.0003)
substitution. Another patient was compound heterozygous for V117I and a
1-bp duplication (699dup; 191350.0004), resulting in a frameshift,
premature termination (Thr234HisfsTer116), and nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay. The mutations were found by exome sequencing and confirmed by
Sanger sequencing. The 324G-C mutation was found in 2 (0.0186%) of
10,758 control alleles from the general population and 1 (0.0142%) of
7,020 alleles in the European American population. None of the other
mutations were found in controls. The patients had onset at age 2.5 and
7 years, respectively, of difficulty walking due to proximal muscle
weakness, and showed a favorable response to pyridostigmine. Muscle
biopsy showed reduced levels of endplate acetylcholine receptors (AChR).
In vitro functional expression studies showed that the 699dup mutation
was unable to restore normal levels of glycosylated AChR in HEK293 cells
with DPAGT1 inhibition.

In 2 sibs with congenital myasthenic syndrome with tubular aggregates-2
(614750), Belaya et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the DPAGT1 gene: a 358C-A transversion resulting in a
leu120-to-met (L120M) substitution, and a 791T-G transversion resulting
in a val264-to-gly (V264G; 191350.0006) substitution. The patients had
onset in the first year of life of hypotonia, poor head control, and
delayed motor development. They showed some improvement in muscle power
during the teenage years, and both showed a response to pyridostigmine.

In a patient with CDG Ij (608093), Timal et al. (2012) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the DPAGT1 gene: a 206T-A
transversion in exon 2 resulting in an ile69-to-asn (I69N) substitution
at a highly conserved residue in the highly conserved dolichol
recognition motif, and a G-to-A transition in intron 1 (161+5G-A)
(191350.0008), which resulted in degradation of the mutant mRNA. The
mutations were found by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1 of the
mutations. In patient-derived cells, the formation of GlcNAc-PP-dolichol
was reduced to 22% of controls. The patient had multisystem problems,
including asphyxia at birth, respiratory insufficiency, frequent apneas,
jaundice, nuclear cataracts, cryptorchidism, dysmorphic features,
hypertonia of the limbs, joint contractures, tremor, and feeding
difficulties. Laboratory studies showed chronic anemia, hypoproteinemia,
increased liver enzymes, and coagulation defects.

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Turkish parents, with CDG Ij (608093),
Wurde et al. (2012) identified a homozygous c.341C-G transversion in
exon 3 of the DPAGT1 gene, resulting in an ala114-to-gly (A114G)
substitution. The mutation was found by homozygosity mapping followed by
candidate gene sequencing. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for
the mutation, which was not found in 100 control alleles of the same
ethnic background. RT-PCR of patient cells showed that the mutation also
increased the normal aberrant splicing seen in controls, resulting in
the skipping of exons 2/3 and a truncated protein. In vitro functional

DPAGT1, ILE29PHE

In 2 Pakistani sibs, born of unrelated parents, with a relatively mild
form of CDH Ij (608093), Iqbal et al. (2013) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the DPAGT1 gene: a c.85A-T transition
resulting in an ile29-to-phe (I29F) substitution, and a c.503T-C
transition resulting in a leu168-to-pro (L168P; 191350.0011)
substitution. The mutations were found by exome sequencing of 1 of the
patients and confirmed by Sanger sequencing in both patients. The
mutations segregated with the disorder and occurred at highly conserved
residues. Neither was present in over 200 ethnically matched chromosomes
or in the dbSNP, 1000 Genomes, or Exome Variant Server databases.
Functional studies of the variants were not performed.

610614	TITLE *610614 TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR-BETA REGULATOR 1; TBRG1
;;TGFB REGULATOR 1;;
NUCLEAR INTERACTOR OF ARF AND MDM2; NIAM
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the p19(Arf) isoform of mouse Cdkn2a (600160) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cDNA library, followed
by RT-PCR of human pancreas cDNA, Tompkins et al. (2006) cloned mouse
and human TBRG1, which they called NIAM. The deduced human protein
contains 411 amino acids.

Using Northern blot analysis, Babalola and Schultz (1995) detected
expression of Tbrg1, which they called Tb5, in all mouse tissues
examined. Highest expression was in testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro and in vivo binding assays, including reciprocal
immunoprecipitation assays, Tompkins et al. (2006) confirmed that NIAM
bound p19(ARF), but not the p16(INK4A) isoform of CDKN2A. NIAM appeared
to function downstream of p19(ARF) in G1-phase growth arrest in both p53
(TP53; 191170)-dependent and p53-independent signaling pathways. NIAM
expression was induced in cells undergoing arrest in response to DNA
damage and TGF-beta-1 (TGFB1; 190180) treatment, suggesting it may also
participate in antiproliferative pathways.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TBRG1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP STS-T95820).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NBPF11 is a member of the NBPF gene family, which consists of 22 genes
and pseudogenes that arose by gene duplication. NBPF genes contain
numerous low-copy repetitive elements and show high intergenic and
intragenic sequence identity in coding and noncoding regions (Vandepoele
et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to NBPF1 (610501),
Vandepoele et al. (2005) identified NBPF11. EST database analysis
revealed NBPF11 expression in a variety of tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vandepoele et al. (2005) determined that the NBPF11 gene contains 20
coding exons, many of which result from internal duplication.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and FISH, Vandepoele et al. (2005) mapped
the NBPF11 gene to an NBPF gene cluster on chromosome 1q21.1.

114780	TITLE *114780 CARBONIC ANHYDRASE VI; CA6
;;CA VI;;
CARBONIC ANHYDRASE, SECRETED;;
GUSTIN
DESCRIPTION Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are a family of zinc metalloenzymes. For
background information on the CA family, see 114800.

CA VI is a 42-kD secreted isozyme found in salivary glands and saliva
(Murakami and Sly, 1987). By using biochemical and immunohistochemical
techniques, Karhumaa et al. (2001) demonstrated that CA VI is also an
elementary component of milk.

Aldred et al. (1991) isolated and sequenced cDNA clones coding for CA6.
The clones identified a 1.45-kb mRNA that was present in high levels in
parotid submandibular salivary glands but absent in other tissues such
as sublingual gland, kidney, liver, and prostate. The cDNA encoded a
protein of 308 amino acids that included a 17-amino acid leader sequence
typical of secreted proteins. The mature CA VI protein has 291 amino
acids, compared to the 259 or 260 residues of the cytoplasmic isozymes;
most of the extra amino acids present are in the carboxyl terminal
region. CA VI has diverged significantly in its structure from the
cytoplasmic isozymes, including CA I (114800), CA II (611492), and CA
III (114750), which are closely related to one another. The CA VI
protein has 35% sequence identity with human CA II, while residues
involved in the active site of the enzymes have been conserved. Southern
analysis of human DNA indicated that there is only 1 gene coding for CA
VI.

Thatcher et al. (1998) identified gustin as CA6. Gustin contains 2
potential N-linked glycosylation sites. By RP-HPLC and SDS-PAGE, gustin
purified from human saliva had a molecular mass of 37 kD before
deglycosylation and 33 kD after.

Karhumaa et al. (2001) showed that the 42-kD CA VI glycopolypeptide
purified from human milk shares 100% homology with salivary CA VI in
protein sequence. They found that its concentration is approximately 8
times higher in human colostrum than in mature milk, the latter
corresponding to the levels previously detected in human saliva. The
high concentration in colostrum, in particular its functional and
structural stability in an acidic milieu, and its growth-supporting role
in the taste buds suggest that milk CA VI is an essential factor in
normal growth and development of the infant alimentary tract.

By means of Southern analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and by in
situ hybridization, Sutherland et al. (1989) mapped the CA6 gene to
1p36.33-p36.22. White et al. (1998) reported physical mapping of the
CA6, ENO1 (172430), and SLC2A5 (138230) genes to 1p36 by study of yeast-
and P1-artificial chromosome (YAC and PAC) contigs. PACs from the contig
were mapped to 1p36.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

;;NUCLEAR ENVELOPE SPECTRIN REPEAT PROTEIN 2;;
NESPRIN 2;;
NUCLEUS AND ACTIN CONNECTING ELEMENT; NUANCE;;
KIAA1011
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching sequence databases for homologs of SYNE1 (608441), Apel et
al. (2000) identified cDNAs encoding SYNE2. Like SYNE1, SYNE2 contains
multiple spectrin repeats and a 60-amino acid C-terminal region
homologous to the Drosophila protein Klarsicht. RT-PCR analysis showed
low to moderate expression of 2 SYNE2 splice variants in most tissues
examined, including skeletal and cardiac muscle, kidney, liver,
pancreas, and placenta, and indicated that alternative splicing patterns
are conserved between SYNE1 and SYNE2.

By searching sequence databases using SYNE1 as probe, followed by PCR
and RACE of several cDNA libraries, Zhang et al. (2001) isolated cDNAs
encoding SYNE2, which they called nesprin-2. The use of alternate
initiation sites and alternative splicing results in 3 major
transcripts, encoding proteins of 542 amino acids (nesprin-2-alpha), 763
amino acids (nesprin-2-beta), and 3,270 amino acids (nesprin-2-gamma),
as well as several other minor variants. All 3 nesprin-2 proteins
contain multiple spectrin repeats, a transmembrane domain within the
C-terminal Klarsicht homology domain, and several N-glycosylation and
phosphorylation sites. Nesprin-2-gamma also has a bipartite nuclear
localization signal and a leucine zipper motif. Northern blot analysis
detected high expression of a 2.7-kb transcript in pancreas, heart, and
skeletal muscle, and widespread low expression of numerous additional
transcripts ranging in size from 3.1 to 11 kb.

By genomic sequence analysis, RT-PCR, and RACE, Zhang et al. (2002) and
Zhen et al. (2002) extended the sequence of SYNE2 and showed that it
encodes a 6,884-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of
796 kD. They identified an N-terminal actin-binding region containing 2
tandem calponin (see 600806) homology domains, as well as an extension
of the spectrin repeat-containing helical rod domain. The actin-binding
domain shares high homology with the corresponding domains of enaptin
and calmin and 97% amino acid identity with the actin-binding domain of
mouse Syne2 (Zhen et al., 2002). Zhang et al. (2002) also identified
SYNE2 homologs in Drosophila and C. elegans.

By Northern dot-blot analysis, Zhen et al. (2002) detected widespread
expression of SYNE2, with highest levels in kidney, liver, stomach,
placenta, spleen, lymphatic nodes, and peripheral blood lymphocytes.
Lowest levels were in skeletal muscle and brain. Zhen et al. (2002)
generated antibody against the actin-binding domain of SYNE2 and, using
fractionation and immunofluorescence, showed that SYNE2 localized to
nuclear membranes with a punctate staining pattern, as well as to the
nucleus, with enrichment at nucleoli. In mitotic cells, SYNE2 associated
with the nuclear envelope during its breakdown and with condensed
chromosomes at prometaphase, then was present throughout the cytoplasm
at later mitotic stages.

GENE FUNCTION

Using fusion proteins, Zhang et al. (2001) determined that SYNE2
requires its C-terminal transmembrane domain to localize to the nuclear
envelope. When the transmembrane domain was deleted, the remaining
C-terminal domain was sufficient to direct nuclear targeting.

Zhen et al. (2002) found that SYNE2 associated with F-actin filaments
via its actin-binding domain in cosedimentation assays. Using fusion
proteins, they showed that the spectrin repeat domains of SYNE2
associated with intracellular membranes and with vesicular structures
colocalizing with beta-COP (600959).

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhen et al. (2002) and Zhang et al. (2002) determined that the SYNE2
gene contains 115 exons and spans approximately 370 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Zhang et al. (2001) mapped the SYNE2 gene to chromosome 14q23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a father and his 2 children with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
(EDMD5; 612999), Zhang et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous mutation
in the SYNE2 gene (T89M; 608442.0001). In a second unrelated family, an
affected woman was heterozygous for the T89M mutation. Patient
fibroblasts and muscle cells showed loss of nuclear envelope integrity
with mislocalization of LMNA (150330) and emerin (EMD; 300384).
Immunofluorescent studies showed loss of SYNE2 expression in the nuclear
envelope and mitochondria of patient fibroblasts. These same changes
were also observed in fibroblasts from patients with other genetic forms
of EDMD, indicating that loss of nesprin is a characteristic of all
forms of EDMD. RNA interference of SYNE2 recapitulated the nuclear
defects membrane defects and changes in the organization of intranuclear
heterochromatin observed in patient cells. Overall, the findings showed
the importance of the nesprin/emerin/lamin complex in the maintenance of
nuclear stability and suggested that changes in the binding
stoichiometry of these proteins is a feature of EDMD. Zhang et al.
(2007) concluded that the disorder is caused in part by uncoupling of
the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhang et al. (2009) showed that Sun1 (607723) and Sun2 (613569)
double-knockout (Sun1/2 DKO) mice and Syne1 and Syne2 double-knockout
(Syne1/2 DKO) mice had similar defects in brain development. Sun1/2 DKO
and Syne1/2 DKO brains were small and showed defective laminary
structures in many brain regions. Examination of neocortex revealed
failure of radial neuronal migration, but not tangential migration of
interneurons, in both Sun1/2 DKO and Syne1/2 DKO mice. Intracellular
movement of nuclei is a prerequisite for proper neuron migration and
development, and Zhang et al. (2009) showed that Sun1 and Sun2 anchored
Syne2 to the nuclear envelope, while Syne1 and Syne2 connected the
nuclear envelope to the microtubule network, permitting nuclear
movement. Syne2 single-knockout mice exhibited defects in learning a
T-maze and were hyperactive in a new environment, but they had no
significant defects in balance or locomotion. Zhang et al. (2009)
concluded that a complex made up of SUN1, SUN2, SYNE1, and SYNE2 is
required for neuronal nuclear movement and for neuronal migration and
development.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 5
SYNE2, THR89MET

In a father and his 2 children with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
(EDMD5; 612999), Zhang et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 466C-T
transition in exon 3 of the SYNE2 gene, resulting in a thr89-to-met
(T89M) substitution in the first spectrin repeat. The father had general
weakness since age 37 years, ptosis, increased serum creatin kinase, and
left ventricular hypertrophy. His daughter had transient cardiac
arrhythmia at age 10 to 14 years, and his son had limb weakness and
winged scapulae at age 8 years, minor respiratory insufficiency, but no
cardiac involvement. In a second unrelated family with EDMD5, an
affected woman was heterozygous for the T89M mutation, and her affected
son was compound heterozygous for T89M and a variant in the SYNE1 gene
(V572L; 608442.0009), which was also present in heterozygosity in the
unaffected father. The mother had a history of muscle weakness and died
at 30 years of age from cardiomyopathy, her son had muscular dystrophy
combined with severe dilated cardiomyopathy requiring heart transplant
at age 26. The mutation was not found in 384 control alleles. In vitro
functional expression assays showed no change in binding of the SYNE2
T89M protein to emerin (EMD; 300384), but patient fibroblasts and muscle
cells showed decreased localization of EMD, LMNA (150330), and SYNE2 to
the nuclear envelope, impaired binding interactions of these 3 proteins,
and disruptions in the organization of intranuclear heterochromatin.

;;UNACTIVE PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR, 23-KD; P23;;
PROSTAGLANDIN E SYNTHASE, CYTOSOLIC; CPGES
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

P23 was first observed as a component of the unactivated avian
progesterone receptor complex, along with HSP70 (see 140550) and HSP90
(see 140571) (Smith et al., 1990). Using the chicken p23 sequence as
probe, Johnson et al. (1994) cloned P23 from a human testis cDNA
library. The deduced 160-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 19 kD and contains several putative phosphorylation sites.
P23 shares about 96% sequence identity with the chicken homolog. Western
blot analysis revealed a 23-kD band in tissue and cell lysates from
several mammalian species including human.

GENE FUNCTION

Freeman and Yamamoto (2002) determined that the P23 molecular chaperone
localizes to genomic response elements in a hormone-dependent manner and
showed that it could disrupt receptor-mediated transcriptional
activation.

Synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from arachidonic acid involves
multiple enzymes, and 2 isoforms of the terminal enzyme of this
biosynthetic pathway, PGE synthase (PGES), have been identified.
Cytosolic PTGES (cPGES) is identical to the heat-shock protein-90 (see
140571) chaperone p23 (Tanioka et al., 2000) and is functionally coupled
to constitutive prostaglandin-endoperoxide H synthase-1 (176805) (Han et
al., 2002). Microsomal PTGES (mPGES; 605172) is inducible by
proinflammatory cytokines such as IL1B (147720). Meadows et al. (2003)
studied expression and localization of both enzyme isoforms in human
fetal membranes either at term or preterm, with or without labor.
Western blot analysis of the amnion and choriodecidua showed no
differences in amounts of either cPGES or mPGES at term or preterm, with
or without labor, in either tissue with advancing gestation. Meadows et
al. (2003) concluded that expression of PGES is not the rate-limiting
step in PGE2 synthesis in fetal membranes at labor.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the P23
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP SHGC-35709).

;;ADDUCIN, GAMMA;;
ADDUCIN-LIKE; ADDL
ADD3/NUP98 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

From a human fetal-brain cDNA library, Katagiri et al. (1996) isolated a
novel human cDNA which they termed adducin-like 70. The predicted amino
acid sequence shows a high degree of homology to adducins alpha (102680)
and beta (102681). In human erythrocytes, adducin is a 200-kD
heterodimeric skeletal component of the cell membrane, where it promotes
the binding of spectrin to actin. This binding is regulated by
calcium/calmodulin (114180). Adducin also is phosphorylated by protein
kinase C. Adducin and its multiple isoforms represent a family of
proteins present in a variety of tissues and cultured cell lines,
including those from brain, kidney, and liver. The gene, symbolized here
ADDL, contains an open reading frame of 2,022 nucleotides encoding 674
amino acids. It shows 54%, 53%, and 59% identity in predicted amino acid
sequence with alpha and beta components of human adducin and rat adducin
63, respectively. Katagiri et al. (1996) stated that human adducin-like
70 is likely to play an important role in the skeletal organization of
the cell membrane. Northern blot analysis indicated ubiquitous
expression of this gene in adult human tissues.

In a comprehensive assay of gene expression, Gilligan et al. (1999)
showed the ubiquitous expression of alpha- and gamma-adducin, in
contrast to the restricted expression of beta-adducin. Beta-adducin was
expressed at high levels in brain and hematopoietic tissues (bone marrow
in humans, spleen in mice).

By RT-PCR of peripheral blood leukocyte RNA, Citterio et al. (1999)
identified a splice variant of ADD3 that includes exon 13. The deduced
706-amino acid protein contains 32 additional amino acids in its
C-terminal tail compared with the protein described by Katagiri et al.
(1996). RT-PCR detected both splice variants in kidney, brain, lung, and
heart.

GENE STRUCTURE

Citterio et al. (1999) determined that the ADD3 gene contains 14 coding
exons and spans over 20 kb.

MAPPING

Katagiri et al. (1996) localized the gene to chromosome 10q24.2-q24.3 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. By radiation hybrid analysis,
Citterio et al. (1999) mapped the ADD3 gene to chromosome 10q24.1-q24.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lanzani et al. (2005) analyzed the ADD3 gene in 40 unrelated individuals
and identified a +386A-G polymorphism (dbSNP rs3731366) in intron 11.
The authors then genotyped 512 newly discovered and never-treated
hypertensive patients (see 145500) for IVS11+386A-G, but found no
association between the polymorphism and ambulatory blood pressure or
plasma levels of renin activity and endogenous ouabain. However,
carriers of a 460W polymorphism in the ADD1 gene (102680.0001) who also
carried the ADD3 G allele had an approximately 8 mm Hg greater increase
in blood pressure than those who carried the ADD3 A allele (p = 0.020 to
0.006, depending on the genetic model applied). Lanzani et al. (2005)
suggested that there were epistatic effects between the ADD1 and ADD3
loci affecting variation in blood pressure.

CYTOGENETICS

- ADD3/NUP98 Fusion Gene

Lahortiga et al. (2003) described a translocation t(10;11)(q25;p15) that
resulted in fusion of the ADD3 gene to the NUP98 gene (601021) on
chromosome 11p15 and development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Purine 5-prime-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5) preferentially hydrolyzes
inosine 5-prime-monophosphate (IMP) and other purine nucleotides, and is
allosterically activated by various compounds, including ATP. The enzyme
is exclusively located in the cytoplasmic matrix of cells and may have a
critical role in the maintenance of a constant composition of
intracellular purine/pyrimidine nucleotides in cooperation with other
nucleotidases.

CLONING

Oka et al. (1994) found 2 distinct but closely related types of cDNAs
for purine 5-prime-nucleotidase in a chicken liver cDNA library. The
encoded A- and B-type proteins were similar throughout a central core of
472 amino acids sharing 79% sequence identity. Using degenerate
oligonucleotides based on identical portions of amino acid sequences
between A- and B-type subunits of the chicken enzyme, Oka et al. (1994)
isolated human cytosolic purine 5-prime-nucleotidase cDNA clones with
PCR. The predicted open reading frame encoded a protein of 561 amino
acids with a molecular mass of 64,966 Da. The deduced amino acid
sequence exhibited 95% identity with the sequence of the B-type subunit
of chicken enzyme. Northern blot analysis of placental polyadenylated
RNA revealed a single band of 3.6 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the NT5C2
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP sts-D38524).

TECTONIC
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Reiter and Skarnes (2006) identified mouse and human TCTN1, which they
named tectonic, after the Greek work for builder, due to its apparent
involvement in a diverse range of developmental processes. The deduced
mouse protein contains 593 amino acids and has an N-terminal signal
peptide. Database analysis indicated that tectonic is the founding
member of a family of evolutionarily conserved secreted and
transmembrane proteins that includes mouse and human TCTN2 (613846) and
TCTN3 (613847) and the single Drosophila tectonic homolog. In mouse
embryos, tectonic was expressed in regions that participate in hedgehog
(see SHH; 600725) signaling. It was first expressed during gastrulation
stages in the ventral node. At embryonic day 9.5, it was expressed in
the gut endoderm, limb buds, notochord, somites, neural tube, and
floorplate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Reiter and Skarnes (2006) determined that the mouse tectonic gene
contains 13 exons.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the TCTN1 gene to chromosome 12q24.11 based on an
alignment of the TCTN1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC040113) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Reiter and Skarnes (2006) mapped the mouse tectonic gene to chromosome
5.

GENE FUNCTION

Reiter and Skarnes (2006) found that mouse tectonic modulated hedgehog
(see SHH; 600725) signaling downstream of smoothened (SMOH; 601500) and
Rab23 (606144) and was required for maximal hedgehog activation.

Using mass spectrometric analysis and immunoprecipitation studies of
mouse proteins and cultured murine cells, Garcia-Gonzalo et al. (2011)
showed that Tctn1 is part of a ciliopathy-associated protein complex and
interacts with several genes associated with ciliopathies, including
Mks1 (609883), Cc2d2a (612013), and Tctn2 (613846). The 2 strongest
interactors were Tctn2 and Tctn3 (613847), indicating that these 3
tectonic proteins are part of the same complex. TCTN1 also interacted
with B9d1 (614144) and Tmem216 (613277), Tmem67 (609884), and Cep290
(610142) under some conditions. In cultured ciliated cells, Tctn1
localized with these proteins to the transition zone between the ciliary
axoneme and the basal body, where it regulates ciliogenesis in a
tissue-dependent manner. Studies of fibroblasts derived from Tctn1-null
mice showed that the tectonic complex also controls ciliary membrane
composition, and is needed for proper ciliary localization of Adcy3
(600291), Pkd2 (173910), Smo (601500), and Arl13b (608922).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By homozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene sequencing,
Garcia-Gonzalo et al. (2011) identified a homozygous splice site
mutation in the TCTN1 gene (609863.0001) in 2 sisters, born of
consanguineous Bangladeshi parents, with Joubert syndrome-13 (JBTS13;
614173). Investigation of 4 families homozygous at the TCTN1 locus and
48 families with JBTS identified no additional mutations, suggesting
that TCTN1 mutations are a rare cause of Joubert syndrome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Reiter and Skarnes (2006) found that tectonic-null mice died between
embryonic days 13.5 and 16.5 and displayed holoprosencephaly. V3
interneurons were lost in tectonic mutants. Loss of ventral neural
markers in tectonic-null mice was accompanied by a ventral expansion of
genes normally restricted to more dorsal domains. Examination of
tectonic-Shh double mutants showed that tectonic could repress as well
as activate hedgehog signaling.

By studies in Tctn1-null mice, Garcia-Gonzalo et al. (2011) determined
that Tctn1 is required for ciliogenesis in a tissue-dependent manner.
Tctn1-null mice showed disruption of nodal flow, laterality defects, and
neural tube dorsalization. Basal bodies docked to the cellular plasma
membrane, but failed to extend axonemes. However, cilia were present in
the notochord, early gut epithelium, and mesenchymal cells surrounding
the neural tube and in the limb bud. Tctn1 -/- embryos developed an
extra preaxial digit on 1 or both hindlimbs. Although Shh expression was
normal, downstream signaling was disturbed, suggesting that Tctn1 is
required for cilium-dependent Shh signal transduction. Tctn2
(613846)-null and Cc2d2a (612013)-null mice showed a similar phenotype,
suggesting that these 3 genes share a common function affecting
ciliogenesis in a tissue-specific manner.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
JOUBERT SYNDROME 13
TCTN1, IVS1AS, A-G, -2

By homozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene sequencing in 2
sisters, born of consanguineous Bangladeshi parents, with Joubert
syndrome-13 (JBTS13; 614173), Garcia-Gonzalo et al. (2011) identified a
homozygous A-to-G transition in intron 1 of the TCTN1 gene, resulting in
a splice site mutation predicted to disrupt domains of the protein
required for its function. The mutation was not found in 96 controls or
in the 1000 Genomes Project data. Brain MRI showed cerebellar vermis
hypoplasia and the molar tooth sign, the characteristic radiographic
feature of JBTS. One girl also had bilateral frontotemporal pachygyria.
Ophthalmologic assessment and renal ultrasounds were normal at ages 7
years and 4 years, respectively.

601054	TITLE *601054 PLEXIN A2; PLXNA2
;;PLEXIN 2; PLXN2;;
TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN OCT; OCT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Maestrini et al. (1996) identified PLXNA2, which they called OCT, as a
gene closely related to SEX (300022), a transmembrane protein with
significant homology to members of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)
receptor family. They also identified 2 other genes closely related to
SEX, PLXNB1 (601053) and PLXNA1 (601055). The proteins encoded by all 4
genes contain large cytoplasmic domains characterized by a distinctive
highly conserved sequence that Maestrini et al. (1996) called the SEX
domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Suto et al. (2007) found that mouse plexin-A2 preferentially localized
to pyramidal cell dendrites, but not to mossy fibers. In contrast,
plexin-A4 localized to mossy fibers. Sema6a (605885) was expressed and
secreted by CA3 pyramidal cells and interneurons in the stratum
lacunosum-moleculare and functioned with plexin-A4 as a repressive
molecule to mediate mossy fiber repulsion. Plexin-A2 attenuated
Sema6a-mediated mossy fiber repulsion, possibly by sequestration of
Sema6a, allowing mossy fibers to invade the suprapyramidal region of
CA3. Suto et al. (2007) concluded that Sema6a, plexin-A2, and plexin-A4
regulate the laminar projection of mossy fibers in mouse hippocampus.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Janssen et al. (2010) presented crystal structures of cognate complexes
of the semaphorin-binding regions of plexins B1 and A2 with semaphorin
ectodomains (human PLXNB1-SEMA4D (601866) and murine PlxnA2-Sema6A
(605885)), plus unliganded structures of PlxnA2(1-4) and Sema6A(ecto).
These structures, together with biophysical and cellular assays of
wildtype and mutant proteins, revealed that semaphorin dimers
independently bind 2 plexin molecules and that signaling is critically
dependent on the avidity of the resulting bivalent 2:2 complex
(monomeric semaphorin binds plexin but fails to trigger signaling). The
data of Janssen et al. (2010) favored a cell-cell signaling mechanism
involving semaphorin-stabilized plexin dimerization, possibly followed
by clustering, which is consistent with previous functional data.
Furthermore, the shared generic architecture of the complexes, formed
through conserved contacts of the amino-terminal 7-bladed beta-propeller
(sema) domains of both semaphorin and plexin, suggested that a common
mode of interaction triggers all semaphorin-plexin-based signaling,
while distinct insertions within or between blades of the sema domains
determine binding specificity.

Nogi et al. (2010) independently reported the crystal structure of the
semaphorin 6A (605885) receptor-binding fragment and the plexin A2
ligand-binding fragment in both their pre-signaling (before binding) and
signaling (after complex formation) states. Before binding, the Sema6A
ectodomain was in the expected face-to-face homodimer arrangement,
similar to that adopted by Sema3A (603961) and Sema4D, whereas PlxnA2
was in an unexpected head-on homodimer arrangement. In contrast, the
structure of the Sema6A-PlxnA2 signaling complex revealed a 2:2
heterotetramer in which the 2 Plxn2A monomers dissociated from one
another and docked onto the top face of the Sema6A homodimer using the
same interface as the head-on homodimer, indicating that plexins undergo
'partner exchange.' Cell-based activity measurements using mutant
ligands/receptors confirmed that the Sema6A face-to-face dimer
arrangement is physiologically relevant and is maintained throughout
signaling events. Nogi et al. (2010) concluded that
homodimer-to-heterodimer transitions of cell-surface plexin that result
in a specific orientation of its molecular axis relative to the membrane
may constitute the structural mechanism by which the ligand-binding
signal is transmitted to the cytoplasmic region, inducing GAP domain
rearrangements and activation.

MAPPING

By analysis of a panel of human/hamster somatic cell hybrids, Maestrini
et al. (1996) mapped the OCT gene to chromosome 1. Gross (2011) mapped
the PLXNA2 gene to chromosome 1q32.2 based on an alignment of the PLXNA2
sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC136530) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

NOMENCLATURE

Tamagnone et al. (1999) proposed a novel nomenclature for the genes of
the plexin family, which they grouped into the A, B, C, and D
subfamilies; the PLXN2 gene was renamed plexin A2 by them.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mossy fibers are the last hippocampal afferents to invade CA3, and in
mouse, they do so around the time of birth. Suto et al. (2007) showed
that plexin-A2 deletion in mice caused a shift of mossy fibers from the
suprapyramidal region to the infra- and intrapyramidal regions. In
plexin-A2 -/- plexin-A4 -/- double-knockout mice, mossy fibers were
widely distributed within CA3 in a pattern similar to that seen in
plexin-A4 -/- mice, suggesting that plexin-A4 has a predominant role in
the laminar projection of mossy fibers. Mossy fiber synapses formed
normally and were functional in plexin-A2 -/- mice.

604527	TITLE *604527 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-GATED, SUBFAMILY H, MEMBER 3; KCNH3
;;POTASSIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-GATED, ETHER-A-GO-GO-RELATED SUBFAMILY,
MEMBER 3;;
BRAIN-SPECIFIC EAG-LIKE CHANNEL 1; BEC1
DESCRIPTION Voltage-gated potassium channels play an essential role in controlling
cellular excitability in the nervous system by regulating a variety of
neuronal properties, such as interspike membrane potential, action
potential waveform, and firing frequency. These channels constitute an
evolutionarily related superfamily that can be classified into 2 groups,
the Shaker family and the ether-a-go-go (eag) family. The eag family
includes Drosophila eag, human EAG (KCNH1; 603305), rat Eag, Drosophila
eag-related gene (erg), human ERG (KCNH2; 152427), and rat Elk. Members
of the eag family are related to cyclic nucleotide-gated cation
channels, hyperpolarization-activated cation channels, and plant
hyperpolarization-activated potassium channels. A common feature of the
C terminus of eag-type channels is a putative cyclic nucleotide-binding
(CNB) domain. By searching an EST database using the amino acid sequence
of human ERG as the query, Miyake et al. (1999) identified ESTs encoding
KCNH3, which they named BEC1. They isolated a cDNA containing the entire
KCNH3 coding sequence. The predicted 1,083-amino acid KCNH3 protein has
6 transmembrane domains, the pore region of voltage-gated potassium
channels, a CNB domain, and putative N-glycosylation sites. KCNH3 shares
95% amino acid sequence identity with rat Kcnh3, 48% identity with human
BEC2 (KCNH4; 604528), 46% identity with rat Elk, 33% similarity with
human ERG, and 30% similarity with rat Eag. The authors concluded that
KCNH3, BEC2, and Elk form a subfamily within the eag family. Expression
of recombinant KCNH3 in mammalian cells induced a voltage-gated outward
current with a fast inactivation component. This current was insensitive
to tetraethylammonium and quinidine. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected a major 4-kb KCNH3 transcript in brain; KCNH3
expression was not found in any other tissue examined. Within brain,
KCNH3 was expressed in cortical structures, such as the cerebral cortex,
amygdala, and hippocampus, and in the striatal regions, including the
putamen and caudate nucleus. KCNH3 expression was not detected in the
spinal cord or in the corpus callosum, which contains primarily axons
and glia. Thus, Miyake et al. (1999) concluded that KCNH3 expression is
largely restricted to the telencephalon. In situ hybridization of rat
brain sections showed prominent expression of Kcnh3 in the hippocampus,
mainly in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell body layers and in the granule
cell layers of the dentate gyrus. In the cerebral cortex, Kcnh3 was
widely expressed from layer II to layer VI, with specific expression in
cell bodies of neurons with typical pyramidal shapes. Miyake et al.
(1999) suggested that KCNH3 is involved in cellular excitability of
restricted neurons in the human central nervous system.

Miyake et al. (1999) noted that the KCNH3 gene overlaps a sequence,
DRES61, that was mapped to 12q13 by Banfi et al. (1996) using FISH.
