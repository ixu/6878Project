;;MAPKKK6;;
APOPTOSIS SIGNAL-REGULATING KINASE 2; ASK2
DESCRIPTION Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades consist of a 3-kinase
module: MAPK, MAPK kinase (MAP2K, MAPKK, or MKK), and MKK kinase (MAP3K,
MAPKKK, or MEKK). These kinase cascades relay signals from the cell
surface to the nucleus, resulting in gene transcription. Growth factors
and mitogens activate the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway,
while stress stimuli and proinflammatory cytokines activate 2 closely
related but distinct parallel pathways, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase
(JNK), or stress-activated kinase (SAPK), pathway and the p38 kinase
pathway. Multiple upstream kinases, the MAP3Ks, have been identified.
MAP3K5 (602448) activates the JNK and p38 pathways and induces apoptosis
when overexpressed in stably transfected cells. Using a portion of
MAP3K5 as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid system, Wang et al. (1998) isolated a
partial cDNA encoding a novel protein kinase, MAP3K6, which they called
MAPKKK6. They isolated a full-length human skeletal muscle MAP3K6 cDNA
encoding a predicted 1,280-amino acid serine/threonine kinase containing
all 11 kinase subdomains. MAP3K6 and MAP3K5 share 45% amino acid
sequence identity; their catalytic domains share 82% identity. The
authors confirmed the interaction of MAP3K6 with MAP3K5 in vivo using
coimmunoprecipitation. Recombinant MAP3K6 weakly activated the JNK but
not the ERK or p38 kinase pathways. Northern blot analysis detected an
approximately 5.0-kb MAP3K6 transcript in several tissues, with the
highest expression in heart and skeletal muscle.

605759	TITLE *605759 ANKYRIN REPEAT- AND SOCS BOX-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; ASB2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteins of the ASB family, such as ASB2, contain central tandem ankyrin
(see 612641) repeats and a C-terminal suppressor of cytokine signaling
(SOCS) box. SOCS box proteins are predicted to be involved in protein
degradation by acting as a bridge between substrate proteins and E3
ubiquitin protein ligases (see 601623) (review by Kile et al., 2002).

CLONING

By EST database searching, probing a mouse spleen cDNA library, and
further database searching, Kile et al. (2000) identified a cDNA
encoding ASB2. Sequence analysis predicted that the 544-amino acid
protein, which is 94% identical to the mouse protein, contains 15
ankyrin repeats and a C-terminal SOCS box. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues revealed wide expression of a 2.6-kb transcript, with
highest expression in muscle, heart, and spleen.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kile et al. (2000) determined that the ASB2 gene contains at least 10
exons.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the ASB2 gene to chromosome 14q32.12 based on an
alignment of the ASB2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK A056723) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Kile et al. (2000) mapped the mouse gene between the markers D12Mit99
and D12Mit278.

GENE FUNCTION

Kohroki et al. (2005) found that epitope-tagged ASB2 and several other
ASB family members interacted with endogenous CUL5 (601741) and RBX2
(RNF7; 603863) in immunoprecipitated HEK293 cells. The ASB proteins did
not interact with CUL2 (603135) or RBX1 (603814). ASB2-CUL5-RBX2
complexes showed E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro.
