DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Swendeman et al. (1994) characterized the genomic structure, chromosome
location, promoter, and expression pattern of CP2, a 66-kD cellular
transcription factor that interacts with the alpha-globin (141800)
promoter as well as with additional cellular and viral promoter
elements. Homodimers of CP2, together with a 45-kD partner protein, form
the so-called stage selector protein complex (Jane et al., 1995) that
binds to a proximal gamma-globin gene promoter regulatory sequence,
termed the stage selector element (SSE). The SSE is thought to be
involved in silencing beta globin gene (141900) transcription during
fetal erythropoiesis (Cunningham et al., 1995).

LBP1 is a cellular protein that binds strongly to sequences around the
human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) initiation site and weakly over
the TATA box. By PCR using primers designed from LBP1 purified from HeLa
cell extracts, Yoon et al. (1994) obtained 4 LBP1 cDNAs, which they
termed LBP1A, LBP1B, LBP1C, and LBP1D. LBP1A and LBP1B are splice
variants of UBP1 (609784), and LBP1C and LBP1D are splice variants of
TFCP2. The deduced LBP1C and LBP1D proteins contain 502 and 451 amino
acids, respectively. In vitro translation resulted in proteins with
apparent molecular masses of 64 and 58 kD, respectively. LBP1D lacks
part of a putative N-terminal DNA-binding domain found in LBP1C. LBP1C
shares 72% amino acid identity with LBP1A, with highest identity in the
N-terminal halves.

GENE FUNCTION

Yoon et al. (1994) found that LBP1C bound to the HIV-1 promoter in a
sequence-specific fashion, but LBP1D did not. LBP1C could activate
transcription from a promoter containing an LBP1-binding site. Both
LBP1C and LBP1D could bind the UBP1 isoforms LBP1A and LBP1B and form
heteromeric complexes. However, LBP1D inhibited the binding of the other
LBPs to the LBP1 recognition site on DNA.

By cDNA microarray, Western blot analysis, and luciferase reporter
assay, Yoo et al. (2009) found significant upregulation of LSF and LSF
transcriptional activity in the nuclei of hepatocellular carcinoma cells
(HCC; 114550) expressing AEG1 (MTDH: 610323) compared to those without
AEG1 expression. The increase in LSF activity correlated with
significant increases in the downstream targets thymidylate synthetase
(TYMS; 188350) during the growth cycle and dihydropyrimidine
dehydrogenase (DPYD; 612779). The AEG1-transfected HCC cells showed more
resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment compared to those without
AEG1 expression, which could be explained by the upregulation of both
TYMS and DPYD. Studies with siRNA targeting AEG1, LSF, or DPYD abrogated
the 5-FU resistance. In nude xenograft mice transfected with an HCC cell
line that expressed AEG1 and showed resistance to 5-FU, inhibition of
AEG1 resulted in significant inhibition in tumor growth, and a
combination of 5-FU and AEG1 inhibition resulted in an additive effect
on tumor growth inhibition. The findings demonstrated that AEG1 confers
resistance to 5-FU by inducing the expression of LSF and DPYD, and
pointed to a central role of AEG1 in HCC development and progression.

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Yoo et al. (2010) found that nuclear
expression of LSF was upregulated in human HCC samples compared with
normal liver. FISH suggested that elevated LSF expression was due to
chromosome 12 polysomy in several HCC samples. Overexpression of LSF in
HepG3 cells increased cell proliferation, colony forming ability, and
anchorage-independent growth in soft agar in culture, and it increased
tumor angiogenesis and metastasis in vivo in mice. Overexpression of a
dominant-negative LSF mutant abrogated these effects. Gene expression
profiling revealed significant induction of osteopontin (OPN, or SPP1;
166490), a gene important in tumor metastasis. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis and reporter gene assays confirmed that LSF
bound and activated the OPN promoter. Yoo et al. (2010) concluded that,
by regulating OPN expression, LSF functions as a key regulator of HCC
development and progression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Swendeman et al. (1994) found that the murine and human TFCP2 genes
contain 16 and 15 exons, respectively. Both genes span approximately 30
kb of chromosomal DNA, and among coding exons, all exon/intron
boundaries are conserved.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Swendeman et al. (1994) showed that
the human TFCP2 gene resides on chromosome 12, while interspecific
backcross analysis demonstrated that the murine gene maps to the distal
end of chromosome 15 in a region syntenic with human chromosome 12. The
murine and human promoters initiated mRNAs at multiple start sites in a
conserved region that spanned more than 450 nucleotides.

Cunningham et al. (1995) mapped the TFCP2 gene to 12q13 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization and within 250 kb of NFE2 (601490), another
erythroid-specific transcription factor which binds to sequences in the
beta-globin locus control region (152424).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lambert et al. (2000) reported an association between a noncoding
polymorphism (G-A) in the 3-prime untranslated region of TFCP2 and
sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD5; 602096) in French and British
populations and a similar trend in a North American population. The
combined analysis of the 3 independent populations suggested a
protective effect of the A allele (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.44-0.75). The A
allele demonstrated reduced binding to nuclear protein(s) from a
neuroblastoma cell line, and absence of the A allele was associated with
lower gene expression in lymphocytes from AD cases compared with
controls. The authors suggested that polymorphic variation in TFCP2 may
be important for the pathogenesis of AD, particularly since the gene
product interacts with proteins such as GSK3B (605004), Fe65 (602709),
and certain factors involved in the inflammatory response.

Taylor et al. (2001) reported an analysis of 216 necropsy-confirmed
Alzheimer disease cases and 301 nondemented controls greater than 73
years. The frequency of the A allele of the TFCP2 gene was reduced in
the Alzheimer disease cases compared to the controls (odds ratio = 0.59,
95% CI, 0.35-1.00). However, the genotype frequencies of the Alzheimer
disease cases when compared to controls were not significantly
different. No significant effects were found when the data were adjusted
for age, sex, or the presence of the apoE4 allele (107741.0016).
