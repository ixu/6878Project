DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Charest et al. (1993) cloned a cDNA encoding a member of a family of
tyrosyl-phosphorylated and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)
that participates in cell cycle progression. They referred to the
protein as p44(erk1) and the gene as ERK1. The cDNA encodes a 379-amino
acid polypeptide sharing approximately 96% predicted amino acid identity
with partial sequences of rodent erk1 cognates. They also characterized
the enzyme biochemically.

MAPPING

Charest et al. (1993) mapped the MAPK3 gene to human chromosome 16 by
hybrid cell panel analysis. Li et al. (1994) assigned human MAPK3 and
MAPK1 to 16p11.2 and 22q11.2, respectively, by a combination of Southern
blotting of a human-hamster hybrid panel and fluorescence in situ
hybridization. The chromosome region surrounding 16p11.2 displays high
homology with mouse chromosome 7, and human 22q11.2 is homologous to
mouse chromosome 16. Saba-El-Leil et al. (1997) mapped the murine
homolog (Mapk3) to mouse chromosome 7.

GENE FUNCTION

Experience-dependent plasticity in the developing visual cortex depends
on electrical activity and molecular signals involved in stabilization
or removal of inputs. ERK1 and ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948) activation in the
cortex is regulated by both factors. Di Cristo et al. (2001)
demonstrated that 2 different inhibitors of the ERK pathway suppress the
induction of 2 forms of long-term potentiation in rat cortical slices
and that their intracortical administration to monocularly deprived rats
prevents the shift in ocular dominance towards the nondeprived eye. Di
Cristo et al. (2001) concluded that the ERK pathway is necessary for
experience-dependent plasticity and for long-term potentiation of
synaptic transmission in the developing visual cortex.

Stefanovsky et al. (2001) showed that epidermal growth factor (131530)
induces immediate, ERK1/ERK2-dependent activation of endogenous
ribosomal transcription, while inactivation of ERK1/ERK2 causes an
equally immediate reversion to the basal transcription level. ERK1/ERK2
was found to phosphorylate the architectural transcription factor UBF
(600673) at amino acids 117 and 201 within HMG boxes 1 and 2, preventing
their interaction with DNA. Mutation of these sites inhibited
transcription activation and abrogated the transcriptional response to
ERK1/ERK2. Thus, growth factor regulation of ribosomal transcription
likely acts by a cyclic modulation of DNA architecture. The data
suggested a central role for ribosome biogenesis in growth regulation.

Using an in situ phosphorylation screening strategy to identify protein
kinase substrates, Fukunaga and Hunter (1997) identified MNK1 (MKNK1;
606724) as an ERK1 substrate. Using 2-hybrid tests and in vitro
association experiments, Waskiewicz et al. (1997) demonstrated that
mouse Mnk1 and Mnk2 (MKNK2; 605069) bind tightly to Erk1 and Erk2
through a C-terminal domain. Mnk1 complexes more strongly with inactive
than active Erk, and the authors hypothesized that Mnk and Erk may
dissociate after mitogen stimulation.

Forcet et al. (2002) showed that in embryonic kidney cells expressing
full-length, but not cytoplasmic domain-truncated, DCC (120470), NTN1
(601614) causes increased transient phosphorylation and activity of ERK1
and ERK2, but not of JNK1 (601158), JNK2 (602896), or p38 (MAPK14;
600289). This phosphorylation was mediated by MEK1 (MAP2K1; 176872)
and/or MEK2 (MAP2K2; 601263). NTN1 also activated the transcription
factor ELK1 (311040) and serum response element-regulated gene
expression. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed interaction of
full-length DCC with MEK1/2 in the presence or absence of NTN1. Forcet
et al. (2002) showed that activation of Dcc by Ntn1 in rat embryonic
day-13 dorsal spinal cord stimulates and is required for the outgrowth
of commissural axons and Erk1/2 activation. Immunohistochemical analysis
demonstrated expression of activated Erk1/2 in embryonic commissural
axons, and this expression was diminished in Dcc or Ntn1 knockout
animals. Forcet et al. (2002) concluded that the MAPK pathway is
involved in responses to NTN1 and proposed that ERK activation affects
axonal growth by phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins and
neurofilaments.

Anthrax lethal toxin (LT), a critical virulence factor of Bacillus
anthracis, is a complex of lethal factor (LF) and protective antigen
(PA). PA binds to the anthrax receptor (ATR; 606410) to facilitate the
entry of LF into the cell. LT disrupts the MAPK signaling pathway in
macrophages (Park et al., 2002). Agrawal et al. (2003) showed that, in
mice, LT impairs the function of dendritic cells (DCs), inhibiting the
upregulation of costimulatory molecules, such as CD40 (109535), CD80
(112203), and CD86 (601020), as well as cytokine secretion, in response
to lipopolysaccharide stimulation. LT-exposed DCs failed to stimulate
antigen-specific T and B cells in vivo, resulting in significant
reductions of circulating IgG antibody. Western blot analysis indicated
that LF severely impairs phosphorylation of p38, ERK1, and ERK2. A
cocktail of synthetic MAPK inhibitors inhibited cytokine production in a
manner similar to that of LF. Using a mutant form of LF lacking a
catalytic site necessary for cleavage of MEK1, MEK2, and MEK3 (602314),
the upstream activators of ERK1, ERK2, and p38, respectively, Agrawal et
al. (2003) found that cleavage of these MEKs is essential for
suppression of dendritic cell function. They proposed that this
mechanism might operate early in infection, when LT levels are low, to
impair immunity. Later in infection, Agrawal et al. (2003) noted, LT
might have quite different inflammatory effects.

Imai et al. (2008) used mouse models to explore the mechanism whereby
obesity enhances pancreatic beta cell mass, pathophysiologic
compensation for insulin resistance. Imai et al. (2008) found that
hepatic activation of ERK1 signaling by expression of constitutively
active MEK1 (176872) induced pancreatic beta cell proliferation through
a neuronal-mediated relay of metabolic signals. This metabolic relay
from the liver to the pancreas is involved in obesity-induced islet
expansion. In mouse models of insulin-deficient diabetes,
liver-selective activation of ERK signaling increased beta cell mass and
normalized serum glucose levels. Thus, Imai et al. (2008) concluded that
interorgan metabolic relay systems may serve as valuable targets in
regenerative treatments for diabetes.

In mouse hearts with pressure-induced cardiac hypertrophy, Lorenz et al.
(2009) observed strong phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2 at thr183, and in
failing human hearts, they found an approximately 5-fold increase in
thr188 phosphorylation compared to controls. The authors demonstrated
that thr188 autophosphorylation directs ERK1/ERK2 to phosphorylate
nuclear targets known to cause cardiac hypertrophy, and that thr188
phosphorylation requires activation and assembly of the entire RAF
(164760)-MEK-ERK kinase cascade, phosphorylation of the TEY motif,
dimerization of ERK1/ERK2, and binding to G protein beta-gamma subunits
(see 139390) released from activated Gq (see 600998). Experiments using
transgenic mouse models carrying mutations at thr188 suggested a causal
relationship to cardiac hypertrophy. Lorenz et al. (2009) proposed that
specific phosphorylation events on ERK1/ERK2 integrate differing
upstream signals to induce cardiac hypertrophy.

During early lung development, airway tubes change shape. Tube length
increases more than circumference as a large proportion of lung
epithelial cells divide parallel to the airway longitudinal axis. Tang
et al. (2011) showed that this bias is lost in mutants with increased
ERK1 and ERK2 activity, revealing a link between the ERK1/2 signaling
pathway and the control of mitotic spindle orientation. Using a
mathematical model, Tang et al. (2011) demonstrated that change in
airway shape can occur as a function of spindle angle distribution
determined by ERK1/2 signaling, independent of effects on cell
proliferation or cell size and shape. Tang et al. (2011) identified
sprouty genes (SPRY1, 602465; SPRY2, 602466), which encode negative
regulators of fibroblast growth factor-10 (FGF10; 602115)-mediated
RAS-regulated ERK1/2 signaling, as essential for controlling airway
shape change during development through an effect on mitotic spindle
orientation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pages et al. (1999) generated p44 Mapk (Erk1)-deficient mice by
homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. The p44 Mapk were
viable, fertile, and of normal size. Thus, Pages et al. (1999) concluded
that p44 Mapk is apparently dispensable and that p42 Mapk (Erk2) may
compensate for its loss. However, in p44 Mapk -/- mice, thymocyte
maturation beyond the CD4+CD8+ stage was reduced by half, with a similar
diminution in the thymocyte subpopulation expressing high levels of T
cell receptor (CD3-high). In p44 Mapk -/- thymocytes, proliferation in
response to activation with a monoclonal antibody to the T cell receptor
in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate was severely reduced even
though activation of p42 Mapk was more sustained in these cells. Thus,
Pages et al. (1999) concluded that p44 Mapk apparently has a specific
role in thymocyte development.

In behavioral tests with mice lacking Erk1, Mazzucchelli et al. (2002)
observed an enhancement of striatum-dependent long-term memory that
correlated with a facilitation of long-term potentiation in the nucleus
accumbens. At the cellular level, ablation of Erk1 resulted in a
stimulus-dependent increase of Erk2 signaling, which Mazzucchelli et al.
(2002) stated was likely due to its enhanced interaction with the
upstream kinase Mek. They concluded that Erk1 has a critical regulatory
role in the long-term adaptive changes underlying striatum-dependent
behavioral plasticity and drug addiction.

A surge of luteinizing hormone (LH; see 152780) from the pituitary gland
triggers ovulation, oocyte maturation, and luteinization for successful
reproduction in mammals. Because the signaling molecules RAS (190020)
and ERK1/2 are activated by an LH surge in granulosa cells of
preovulatory follicles, Fan et al. (2009) disrupted Erk1/2 in mouse
granulosa cells and provided in vivo evidence that these kinases are
necessary for LH-induced oocyte resumption of meiosis, ovulation, and
luteinization. In addition, biochemical analyses and selected disruption
of the Cebpb gene (189965) in granulosa cells demonstrated that
C/EBP-beta is a critical downstream mediator of ERK1/2 activation. Thus,
Fan et al. (2009) concluded that ERK1/2 and C/EBP-beta constitute an in
vivo LH-regulated signaling pathway that controls ovulation- and
luteinization-related events.

Holm et al. (2011) showed that Erk1/2 and Smad2 (601366) are activated
in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome, and both are inhibited by therapies
directed against Tgf-beta (190180). Whereas selective inhibition of
ERK1/2 activation ameliorated aortic growth, Smad4 (600993) deficiency
exacerbated aortic disease and caused premature death in Marfan syndrome
mice. Smad4-deficient Marfan syndrome mice uniquely showed activation of
Jnk1 (601158), and a Jnk antagonist ameliorated aortic growth in Marfan
mice that lacked or retained full Smad4 expression. Thus, Holm et al.
(2011) concluded that noncanonical (Smad-independent) Tgf-beta signaling
is a prominent driver of aortic disease in Marfan syndrome mice, and
inhibition of the ERK1/2 or JNK1 pathways is a potential therapeutic
strategy for the disease.
